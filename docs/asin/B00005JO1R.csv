637262,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00005JO1R,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[2, 2]","""Walk the Line"" isn't just an admirable improvisation; it is a great movie.  Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) live out the classic love story.  He is in love with her, but she is usually unavailable or uninterested.  There are other fascinating storylines available, too.  The movie illuminates his difficult childhood with his brother's tragedy and his father's abuse.  We also feel the anguish of an artist before he becomes famous.  He must start with an unfulfilling marriage and an unrewarding sales job before he gets to become fulfilled in life.  The steps after success aren't always uplifting either.  He goes through infidelity, drinking, and drug abuse before he sees the light of what success and happiness can really garner.Perenially, it has been said that the performances in ""Walk the Line"" are remarkable.  True enough.  The story's presentation is marvelous, though, too.  It could have been assembled any way, but we start and end with the ""Folsum Prison"" concert, creating the anticipation and closure we need.  The country music performances are intertwined with scenes about John and June's relationship, and all of it is worthwhile.  While many comments have been made about Joaquin's reinactment of the music, it is engaging enough to work well.  (Subjectively, one of the best scenes in the movie is when Joaquin and Reese perform ""It Ain't Me Babe,"" a Bob Dylan song.)  ""Walk the Line"" is an excellent movie that doesn't require the viewer to like country music (although it certainly helps). The movie is a sincere and flattering portrait of an honest and uncompromising man who was genuine and human enough to represent the tragedies and concerns of all people who struggle in daily life.  The movie doesn't make a legend, but it certainly celebrates one.",5,Resurrecting the Man in Black,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,1816,"['Walk', 'Line', ""n't"", 'just', 'admirable', 'improvisation', 'great', 'movie', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'June', 'Carter', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'live', 'out', 'classic', 'love', 'story', 'love', 'usually', 'unavailable', 'uninterested', 'are', 'other', 'fascinating', 'storylines', 'available', 'too', 'movie', 'difficult', 'childhood', 'brother', 'tragedy', 'father', 'abuse', 'also', 'feel', 'anguish', 'artist', 'famous', 'must', 'start', 'unfulfilling', 'marriage', 'unrewarding', 'sales', 'job', 'become', 'fulfilled', 'life', 'steps', 'success', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'uplifting', 'either', 'infidelity', 'drinking', 'drug', 'abuse', 'light', 'what', 'success', 'happiness', 'can', 'really', 'garner.Perenially', 'been', 'said', 'performances', 'Walk', 'Line', 'are', 'remarkable', 'True', 'enough', 'story', 'presentation', 'marvelous', 'though', 'too', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'assembled', 'way', 'start', 'end', 'Folsum', 'Prison', 'concert', 'creating', 'anticipation', 'closure', 'need', 'country', 'music', 'performances', 'are', 'intertwined', 'scenes', 'John', 'June', 'relationship', 'worthwhile', 'many', 'comments', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Joaquin', 'reinactment', 'music', 'engaging', 'enough', 'work', 'well', 'Subjectively', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'movie', 'when', 'Joaquin', 'Reese', 'perform', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Me', 'Babe', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'song', 'Walk', 'Line', 'excellent', 'movie', ""n't"", 'require', 'viewer', 'like', 'country', 'music', 'certainly', 'movie', 'sincere', 'flattering', 'portrait', 'honest', 'uncompromising', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'genuine', 'human', 'enough', 'represent', 'tragedies', 'concerns', 'people', 'who', 'struggle', 'daily', 'life', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'legend', 'certainly', 'one']",Walk the Line

Cooper ""possum""","[4, 4]","I was not that familiar with Johnny Cash, June Carter, or their music when I saw Walk The Line, and I fell in love with both the music and the story. Joaquin Phoenix is extraordinary as Cash, and Reese Witherspoon leaves behind her blond dingbat roles to morph into Carter. Wonderful acting jobs.But...I have since read biographies of Cash by those close to him, and am disappointed by the fictions told or implied by the script. For instance, my favorite scene, where Cash plays for Sam Phillips for the first time, is awesome and unforgettable -- except for the fact that it didn't happen anything close to how it was portrayed. That's to be expected in a biopic, but what annoys me is that you're left with the impression that after June accepted Cash's marriage proposal he got clean of drugs and they lived happily ever after. The truth apparently is that he used drugs for practically the rest of his life, trapped by an addiction that damaged his career and reputation, almost destroyed his marriage, and over the years took a horrible toll on his health. We see Cash struggling with drugs in the film, but according to Walk The Line, all it took was a good woman to set him free.Enjoy this film -- and there is a ton of stuff to enjoy -- but know that it unfortunately leaves us with a simplified -- and typical -- Hollywood ending.",4,"Great movie, but...",1169856000,"01 27, 2007",2007,1340,"['was', 'not', 'familiar', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'June', 'Carter', 'music', 'when', 'saw', 'Walk', 'Line', 'fell', 'love', 'music', 'story', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'extraordinary', 'Cash', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'blond', 'dingbat', 'roles', 'morph', 'Carter', 'Wonderful', 'acting', 'jobs.But', 'have', 'read', 'biographies', 'Cash', 'close', 'am', 'disappointed', 'fictions', 'told', 'implied', 'script', 'instance', 'favorite', 'scene', 'where', 'Cash', 'Sam', 'Phillips', 'first', 'time', 'awesome', 'unforgettable', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'anything', 'close', 'how', 'was', 'portrayed', 'be', 'expected', 'biopic', 'what', ""'re"", 'left', 'impression', 'June', 'accepted', 'Cash', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'got', 'clean', 'drugs', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'truth', 'apparently', 'used', 'drugs', 'practically', 'rest', 'life', 'trapped', 'addiction', 'damaged', 'career', 'reputation', 'almost', 'destroyed', 'marriage', 'years', 'took', 'horrible', 'toll', 'health', 'see', 'Cash', 'struggling', 'drugs', 'film', 'according', 'Walk', 'Line', 'took', 'was', 'good', 'woman', 'set', 'free.Enjoy', 'film', 'ton', 'stuff', 'enjoy', 'know', 'unfortunately', 'simplified', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'ending']",Walk the Line

In fact, it's pretty much the same thing as ""Ray"" from the previous year, only with more subdued and less hammy performances. This movie was meant to be Oscar bait, and Reese Witherspoon did indeed walk away with a statuette, so mission accomplished. That being said...Walk the Line is the Johnny Cash biopic, and within the quite codified conventions of the biopic (especially musical biopic) genre, it is quite good, at times, even excellent. If you didn't see this movie in the theaters, you missed quite a show, because the musical numbers here are something that most home audio systems won't be able to replicate. The director, James Mangold, does an outstanding job of staging these sequences, and it is easy to see how Cash's music electrified listeners at the time. It even delivered a sizable jolt to me, and I generally dislike country music (most music, for that matter). Joaquin Phoenix and Witherspoon are magnificent on stage, I suppose that technically they are better singers than the performers they are playing. Since the music is one of the big draws, I figured I would comment separately on it and just say that this part is fantastically executed.As for the rest of it...credit Mangold and his screenwriters for not folding in every musical biopic cliche into their movie. There's no Freudian back door that conveniently wraps up everything, as in ""Ray"", which was completely untrue as to Charles' problems in real life. There is a groaner when Witherspoon tells Cash, ""You cain't walk no line,"" after a drunken, drugged-up, all-night jam session with his band. Still, this is familiar territory for anyone who as seen a biopic or gets VH-1 on their TV. The execution is better than most, but people who come to watch a completely original story or want to find some sort of message will be disappointed.Overall, this movie succeeds at what it tries to be, and for that, I give it 4 stars. One gripe though: even though Reese Witherspoon's Oscar was deserved, just looking at the last couple of years' worth of Oscar wins shows a pattern that anyone who is not a ""serious"" actor that plays a pop culture celebrity and does a good impersonation seems to be a shoo-in for an Oscar. I guess Jim Carrey's only mistake wasn't that he wasn't as good as the guy that won, he just picked out the wrong role--maybe a biopic about the secret inner life of David Bowie would get him some gold? Seriously, imitation can win awards, but let's tone it down, before Jamie Foxx wins Oscar #2 for ""Stevie"". Bunz singing ""Cherie Amor"".

Also talks about Johnny's addiction to pills and his unhealthy relationship with his father. Witherspoon received an oscar for her role, a much-derserved award for this talented actress. Phoenix is wonderful as well, he sure has Cash's mannerisms down to a T. John and June would eventually get married and spend 35 years in wedded bliss til their deaths took form.

If your not watching this on a decent home theatre system you are missing a whole lot.Viewing this I kept waiting for particuler events to happen that never played out. Ring of Fire was not presented as a true focalpoint of Johnny and June's relationship, just bits and pieces of another song being written. It wasn't even discussed between them in the film. Strange. Then they played it uneventfully. Mr. Phoenix had Cash's movements down well but I kept being distracted by predictability. The film is entertaining though and I learned a little more about times and places. Reese Witherspoon is finally playing a role made for her instead of those cheesy supposed comedy ""films"". Her acting had real believability and she was properly awarded. A Boy Named Sue was not used for the prison singing scenes and I'm not sure why. It was done there, has wide appeal, would capture a new audience and is just a wild song to have witnessed prisoner reaction to.I wanted to see Johnny Cashes spiritual road expounded upon more but the film ended rather abruptly.

Oh, why don't I like this film, it's  because what happens is a train wreck and without the energy and emotion to make it palpable.  I respect both of the actors and the director as well as Cash and his wife, but this film makes the worst compromises. It sacrifices genuine moments of joy in his life for muted paraphrases of them. Film is an emotional medium in terms of storytelling and you can't tell a biopic with it. Often biopics are inaccurate because of this and it seems this one has the reverse problem, they made a dull movie because they didn't want to be accused of sensationalism. That ""d word"" in the last sentence sums up this movie just fine. It's dull from start to finish, it never takes off and it finishes in a way that makes even the biggest supporter of it think ""that's it""  or even possibly ""well, it had to end sometime"" or even ludicrously, ""I thought they were going to cover the later years when he did that cover of ""hurt""."" I can't think of one reason for this movie even existing except for the fact they were cashing in on the bandwagon of people who became fans when the media made a deserved tribute to him when he died. It's possibly and even likely that Cash's life is worthy of dramatization, but what's shown here isn't worth the trouble.  It's not terrible because of the performances, but the performances feel like composites instead of authentic portrayals.

637271,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00005JO1R,Alistair McHarg,"[3, 7]","Walk The Line is a well crafted movie featuring exceptional performances.  It's long, and there are whole sections where little seems to be happening, (or worse, the same things seem to be happening over and over), but it's worth it for two short scenes.The first is when Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) cleans up his act (for the moment) and walks onto the Folsom Prison stage a fully formed star.  At that moment he is in complete command of his technical abilities and sense of self.  He is contrite and cocky, even feisty, and gives his audience exactly what they want and need.The other is almost antithetical.  June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) is alone on stage, bathed in a blue spotlight.  She is performing Wildwood Flower, accompanying herself on autoharp.  Her tone is clean and open, this is a woman who grew up in music, the stage is where she feels most comfortable.  She doesn't dazzle, she merely gives.  Wildwood Flower is an example of purely beautiful Appalachian folk music, a far cry from the ersatz Elvis eyewash forming the foundation of Cash's early career.Though strong, the film has major flaws.  For one, country music itself is almost a total write-off, it's borderline unlistenable.  Next, Cash was never much of a singer, which explains his tuneless mumbling.  The Man In Black was also just an average guitarist, although he did pen a few catchy songs.  June Carter, by contrast, was a treasure and Reese Witherspoon's performance is nothing short of amazing.  Witherspoon captures all of Carter's ebullience, energy, and sheer charm, without ever seeming artificial.  This raises another point.Lately it's fashionable for actors playing musicians to do their own singing, presumably in an attempt to lend authenticity.  This charmingly idiotic conceit is exclusively predicated on thespian vanity.  (Does James Brown perform Shakespeare In The Park?  Think about it.)  Film is artifice, acting is artifice, why intersperse documentation?  In fact, having Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon lip-synching would be more, not less, authentic.Another drawback is that the story, however accurate, is a weather beaten cliche.  A tormented kid of humble means and limited emotional resources fails to navigate the corridors of fame successfully, falls, and gradually pulls himself out of the gutter a sadder but wiser man.  It's beyond tired, it's plug-and-play.  Of course, the Johnny Cash story is already well known so this paint-by-numbers exercise is even less surprising than usual.Biopics leverage pre-existing fame and convert it to income, after all, the advance work is done.  Since there are no surprises to be had, the only question is - is WTL well done?  Fortunately, the answer is yes.  Phoenix and Witherspoon both dazzle.  Had Cash been more than a two-chord picker boasting a deep baritone and a vocal range almost approaching one full octave, had he, for example, been an actual artist with something worthwhile to say and an interesting way of saying it, it would be easier to care about his simplistic obsession with self-destruction.",4,"Because You Whine, I Cross The Line",1153008000,"07 16, 2006",2006,3073,"['Line', 'well', 'crafted', 'movie', 'featuring', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'long', 'are', 'whole', 'sections', 'where', 'little', 'be', 'happening', 'worse', 'same', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'happening', 'two', 'short', 'scenes.The', 'first', 'when', 'Cash', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'up', 'act', 'moment', 'Folsom', 'Prison', 'stage', 'fully', 'formed', 'star', 'moment', 'complete', 'command', 'technical', 'abilities', 'sense', 'self', 'contrite', 'cocky', 'even', 'feisty', 'audience', 'exactly', 'what', 'want', 'need.The', 'other', 'almost', 'antithetical', 'June', 'Carter', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'alone', 'stage', 'bathed', 'blue', 'spotlight', 'performing', 'Wildwood', 'Flower', 'accompanying', 'autoharp', 'tone', 'clean', 'open', 'woman', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'music', 'stage', 'where', 'most', 'comfortable', ""n't"", 'dazzle', 'merely', 'Wildwood', 'Flower', 'example', 'purely', 'beautiful', 'Appalachian', 'folk', 'music', 'far', 'cry', 'ersatz', 'Elvis', 'eyewash', 'forming', 'foundation', 'Cash', 'early', 'career.Though', 'strong', 'film', 'major', 'flaws', 'one', 'country', 'music', 'almost', 'total', 'write-off', 'borderline', 'unlistenable', 'Next', 'Cash', 'was', 'never', 'much', 'singer', 'tuneless', 'mumbling', 'Man', 'Black', 'was', 'also', 'just', 'average', 'guitarist', 'did', 'pen', 'few', 'catchy', 'songs', 'June', 'Carter', 'contrast', 'was', 'treasure', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'performance', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing', 'Witherspoon', 'Carter', 'ebullience', 'energy', 'sheer', 'charm', 'ever', 'seeming', 'artificial', 'point.Lately', 'fashionable', 'actors', 'playing', 'musicians', 'do', 'own', 'singing', 'presumably', 'attempt', 'lend', 'authenticity', 'charmingly', 'idiotic', 'conceit', 'exclusively', 'predicated', 'thespian', 'vanity', 'Does', 'James', 'Brown', 'perform', 'Shakespeare', 'Park', 'Think', 'Film', 'artifice', 'acting', 'artifice', 'why', 'intersperse', 'documentation', 'fact', 'having', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'lip-synching', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'not', 'less', 'drawback', 'story', 'however', 'accurate', 'weather', 'beaten', 'cliche', 'tormented', 'kid', 'humble', 'means', 'limited', 'emotional', 'resources', 'navigate', 'corridors', 'fame', 'successfully', 'falls', 'gradually', 'gutter', 'sadder', 'wiser', 'man', 'tired', 'plug-and-play', 'course', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'story', 'already', 'well', 'known', 'so', 'paint-by-numbers', 'exercise', 'even', 'less', 'surprising', 'usual.Biopics', 'leverage', 'pre-existing', 'fame', 'convert', 'income', 'advance', 'work', 'done', 'are', 'surprises', 'be', 'had', 'only', 'question', 'WTL', 'well', 'done', 'Fortunately', 'answer', 'yes', 'Phoenix', 'Witherspoon', 'dazzle', 'Had', 'Cash', 'been', 'more', 'two-chord', 'picker', 'boasting', 'deep', 'baritone', 'vocal', 'range', 'almost', 'approaching', 'one', 'full', 'octave', 'had', 'example', 'been', 'actual', 'artist', 'something', 'worthwhile', 'say', 'interesting', 'way', 'saying', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'care', 'simplistic', 'obsession', 'self-destruction']",Walk the Line

During parts of the movie you feel like you're watching Cash home movies. Phoenix does an incredible job, not only in portraying Cash but in singing his songs as well. He nails the mannerisms right down to the sideways smile. At times you get chills watching his performance as the resemblence is uncanny. Not so much for Reese Witherspoon, although she also does her own singing and does a great job in her portrayal, I kept seeing Reese and not June. I really liked this movie. Although it doesn't drag it does seem like it's a lot longer than it is. Also as with most bio-pics they stop at a point when things seem to settle down in the career. The movie tells the story of the man in black and his start in the music business. It follows him as he tries to win the heart of June Carter. Along the way other various big names pop up, Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and Shooter Jennings playing his father Waylon.A great movie that is certainly Oscar worthy if for nothing else that for Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal.

Beverly""","[4, 4]","Wow, I didn't expect this kind of autobiographical story to be such a hit on the big screen, I had heard it was good, so when my brother invited me to the movies I went and was not disappointed.  I'm not a big country fan, and to be honest, I'd never even heard of June Carter, so I don't think it's the music link that necessarily makes this movie work so well.That isn't to say the music wasn't first rate and really made the movie flow and there were also some great scenes showing a young Elvis and other stars that toured with Cash when he was first starting out and met Carter (played wonderfully by Reese Witherspoon).  All the acting and singing was great.The real story here is a love story, and unfortunately it also includes lies, adultery, drug use and horrible neglect of ones children.  Life is pain, I believe Scott Peck said that, or something similar, and this movie really shows life as pain.  Never the less, there is redemption too for without it no story would be worth much.There is no reason to get into all the arguments one can make as to why Cash's relationship with Carter was wrong when it started out, he was married and had children, however, before a judgment can be made all the facts need to be known, and here at least, in this film, we are only given a glimpse.  What we do see, however, and perhaps that's the story Cash really wanted us to see when he wrote his story (which was used to write the screen play) is that June Carter loved Cash and her love rescued him from a life of self imposed hell inflicted in many ways but most prominently through the abuse of pills.This next couple of sentences contain a couple of scenes from the movie, minor but perhaps spoilers, so skip if you'd like, anyway, I really thought the scene in which June takes John back to church was moving and it spoke volumes, it was very brief, however, in some way, it made the movie all tie together.  The other short but important telling scene, I only wish I could believe it really happened (perhaps I need to read the book and see) is when Cash is recovering and the Carter family confronts the drug dealer with shot guns.  I'd like to think that scene was real and I'd wish we'd see more of that today.  In any case, that kind of loving friendship was what June offered Johnny and that's why this movie is really a great love story (in spite of the horrible back story and what is I'm sure still lingering pain in the children he had with his first wife).All that said, I highly recommend this movie, go see it on the big screen.",5,"Excellent writing, acting, story, an all around great film",1134345600,"12 12, 2005",2005,2549,"['Wow', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'kind', 'autobiographical', 'story', 'be', 'such', 'hit', 'big', 'screen', 'had', 'heard', 'was', 'good', 'so', 'when', 'brother', 'invited', 'movies', 'went', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'country', 'fan', 'be', 'honest', ""'d"", 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'June', 'Carter', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'music', 'link', 'necessarily', 'movie', 'work', 'so', 'well.That', ""n't"", 'say', 'music', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'rate', 'really', 'made', 'movie', 'flow', 'were', 'also', 'great', 'scenes', 'showing', 'young', 'Elvis', 'other', 'stars', 'toured', 'Cash', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'starting', 'out', 'met', 'Carter', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'acting', 'singing', 'was', 'great.The', 'real', 'story', 'here', 'love', 'story', 'unfortunately', 'also', 'lies', 'adultery', 'drug', 'use', 'horrible', 'neglect', 'ones', 'children', 'Life', 'pain', 'believe', 'Scott', 'Peck', 'said', 'something', 'similar', 'movie', 'really', 'life', 'pain', 'less', 'redemption', 'too', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'much.There', 'reason', 'get', 'arguments', 'one', 'can', 'make', 'why', 'Cash', 'relationship', 'Carter', 'was', 'wrong', 'when', 'started', 'out', 'was', 'married', 'had', 'children', 'however', 'judgment', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'facts', 'need', 'be', 'known', 'here', 'least', 'film', 'are', 'only', 'given', 'glimpse', 'What', 'do', 'see', 'however', 'perhaps', 'story', 'Cash', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'when', 'wrote', 'story', 'was', 'used', 'write', 'screen', 'play', 'June', 'Carter', 'loved', 'Cash', 'love', 'rescued', 'life', 'self', 'imposed', 'hell', 'inflicted', 'many', 'ways', 'most', 'prominently', 'abuse', 'pills.This', 'next', 'couple', 'sentences', 'contain', 'couple', 'scenes', 'movie', 'minor', 'perhaps', 'spoilers', 'so', 'skip', ""'d"", 'like', 'anyway', 'really', 'thought', 'scene', 'June', 'John', 'back', 'church', 'was', 'moving', 'spoke', 'volumes', 'was', 'very', 'brief', 'however', 'way', 'made', 'movie', 'tie', 'together', 'other', 'short', 'important', 'telling', 'scene', 'only', 'wish', 'could', 'believe', 'really', 'happened', 'perhaps', 'need', 'read', 'book', 'see', 'when', 'Cash', 'recovering', 'Carter', 'family', 'drug', 'dealer', 'shot', 'guns', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'scene', 'was', 'real', ""'d"", 'wish', ""'d"", 'see', 'more', 'today', 'case', 'kind', 'loving', 'friendship', 'was', 'what', 'June', 'offered', 'Johnny', 'why', 'movie', 'really', 'great', 'love', 'story', 'spite', 'horrible', 'back', 'story', 'what', ""'m"", 'sure', 'still', 'lingering', 'pain', 'children', 'had', 'first', 'wife', '.All', 'said', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'go', 'see', 'big', 'screen']",Walk the Line

637280,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JO1R,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Despite the fact that `Ray' was just released the year prior to critical acclaim, even winning an Oscar or two, and the fact that the life story of Johnny Cash is in a way very similar the film `Walk the Line' does a brilliant job of making this life story all that much more compelling and entertaining than last years submission.  This is due in large part to the fantastic performances of the entire cast, most notably Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon and the Oscar snubbed Ginnifer Goodwin who brilliantly balances support, frustration and sympathy as Cash's ex wife Vivian.  James Mangold has that same eye for detail as Hackford possessed in `Ray' but he ups the ante by fleshing out not only the demons that corrupted Cash's soul but also the angel that saved him in the end, notably June Carter.Right off the bat we are introduced to the Cash household and immediately the lines are drawn as in who the supportive parent and who the dominating overbearing parent is, and when the tragic death of Johnny's older brother shakes things up within that household no one is ever truly the same afterward.  Racked with guilt for not being there when he was hurt and or being the surviving sibling Johnny lived the majority of his life with suppressed grief and constant dissatisfaction with any of his many accomplishments.  The film beautifully flows through his adolescent life in the army, his early life married sweetheart Vivian and then the early points in his career until fame and fortune drove Johnny to drugs and, you guessed it, women.But it was one woman who stole his heart and cured his soul, and that was June Carter, played brilliantly by Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon.  Her charisma, charm and sincerity helped tame a tortured man and gave him reason to believe in himself and in the prospect of living a happy and fulfilling life once and for all.  The film chronicles their love affair from its rocky start, shaky middle and everlasting end and it does so with such elegance and patience that the viewer becomes so invested in these characters as people and we begin to sympathize, rationalize and relate to their very souls.  Phoenix is a force to be reckoned with as he attacks Cash's very being with such reverence and determination that I felt I witnessed the birth of a true star, and Witherspoon earned her Oscar with the same fiery determination evident in her co-star.The supporting players all pull their weight as well, from Ginnifer Goodwin's Oscar worthy performance to Robert Patrick's sinister father, the man we loathe in entirety yet learn isn't without saving, as well as the entire cast of young actors and musicians all help create a feeling and a mood that perfectly compliments the films purpose.  Not a single performance is forced, out of place or unworthy of mention.Another highlight is the music, all of which was sung by the actual actors themselves, which is another step-up from last years `Ray'.  Both Joaquin and Reese devour each sung line with enthusiasm and pure talent and it also helps cement them into their characters, fleshing out both Johnny and June and making them more real.

637281,A29X0YEL6O4KZI,B00005JO1R,"Andrew J. Dobrow ""Career Writer""","[8, 8]","OK...you caught me. I'm a Johnny Cash fan and this review may be biased. So shoot me. But thankfully enough no bias is needed to enjoy this film. The story of Johnny Cash is one of inspiration and perseverance. Walk The Line documents Johnny Cash's life from early childhood (with the death of his brother, Jack) to the time he proposes to June Carter on stage, even though she had refused him so many time already up to that point. It's a rag to riches story and in inspirational picture that shows as long as you have passion for something, then anything is possible.From his childhood wordplay, to his buying of his first guitar while he was away in the army in Germany, through his audition for a little label called Sun Records, to the point where he first sees the woman he has been waiting for all of his life, this movie delivers on every aspect. The script is solid and well-written for each role. The dialog and actions are true to life form for the body language and slang of the time. The recreation of the various venues and concerts are realistic and natural. James Mangold has created, by far, his best film.Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have something that is rarely found in cinema. They have acting chemistry. Both of them perform practically without flaw. Reese looks absolutely adorable with the dark-brown hair of June Carter, and has no problem playing her sassy, silly, and caring personality. In various moments of the film. Joaquin Phoenix resembles Johnny Cash to an eerie level of realism. In fact, not only Reese and Joaquin did a great job, but the whole cast from supporting roles to extras did a fantastic job. Though Joaquin Phoenix could have easily won the Oscar for best actor instead of Heath Ledger.One of my favorite parts of the film are the music scenes. The performances are not dubbed over by the actual voices of Johnny Cash and June Carter, but redone by the respected actors. It gives the film a taste of uniqueness and creativity. Surprisingly, both Phoenix and Witherspoon have a wonderful voice, and Phoenix had to learn the guitar from scratch for the role. To tell you the truth, I prefer Reese Witherspoon's voice compared to some of June Carter's work. Another element of the film that stood out was the editing. Done through music montages and split-screen progressions, the time spans that pass in this movie are done so in a way that let's the audience know what is going on in that period, but also not leaving the character in the dark about the present.Walk The Line is the best film of the year. Simple as that. The acting and directing carry this movie to the far reaches of the heart. Even though the camera work is nothing out of the ordinary, all of the other aspects are enough to keep the film afloat. This film truly drawls the audiences compassion and care for Johnny and his ever dieing devotion to the sassy June Carter. Johnny Cash may have not been the most handsome man or the most courageous, but what he lacks physically is made up for with one of the strongest hearts in all of music and a soul that sings to all of humanity.4.5/5",5,I Keep A Close Watch On This Heart Of Mine,1143244800,"03 25, 2006",2006,3113,"['OK', 'caught', ""'m"", 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'fan', 'review', 'may', 'be', 'biased', 'So', 'shoot', 'thankfully', 'enough', 'bias', 'needed', 'enjoy', 'film', 'story', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'one', 'inspiration', 'perseverance', 'Walk', 'Line', 'documents', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'life', 'early', 'childhood', 'death', 'brother', 'Jack', 'time', 'June', 'Carter', 'stage', 'even', 'had', 'refused', 'so', 'many', 'time', 'already', 'up', 'point', 'rag', 'riches', 'story', 'inspirational', 'picture', 'as', 'long', 'have', 'passion', 'something', 'then', 'anything', 'childhood', 'wordplay', 'buying', 'first', 'guitar', 'was', 'away', 'army', 'Germany', 'audition', 'little', 'label', 'called', 'Sun', 'Records', 'point', 'where', 'first', 'woman', 'been', 'waiting', 'life', 'movie', 'delivers', 'aspect', 'script', 'solid', 'well-written', 'role', 'dialog', 'actions', 'are', 'true', 'life', 'form', 'body', 'language', 'slang', 'time', 'recreation', 'various', 'venues', 'concerts', 'are', 'realistic', 'natural', 'James', 'Mangold', 'created', 'far', 'best', 'film.Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'have', 'something', 'rarely', 'found', 'cinema', 'have', 'acting', 'chemistry', 'perform', 'practically', 'flaw', 'Reese', 'absolutely', 'adorable', 'dark-brown', 'hair', 'June', 'Carter', 'problem', 'playing', 'sassy', 'silly', 'caring', 'personality', 'various', 'moments', 'film', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'eerie', 'level', 'realism', 'fact', 'not', 'only', 'Reese', 'Joaquin', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'whole', 'cast', 'supporting', 'roles', 'extras', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'actor', 'instead', 'Heath', 'Ledger.One', 'favorite', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'music', 'scenes', 'performances', 'are', 'not', 'dubbed', 'actual', 'voices', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'June', 'Carter', 'redone', 'respected', 'actors', 'film', 'taste', 'uniqueness', 'creativity', 'Surprisingly', 'Phoenix', 'Witherspoon', 'have', 'wonderful', 'voice', 'Phoenix', 'had', 'learn', 'guitar', 'scratch', 'role', 'tell', 'truth', 'prefer', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'voice', 'compared', 'June', 'Carter', 'work', 'element', 'film', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'editing', 'Done', 'music', 'montages', 'split-screen', 'progressions', 'time', 'pass', 'movie', 'are', 'done', 'so', 'way', 'let', 'audience', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'period', 'also', 'not', 'leaving', 'character', 'dark', 'present.Walk', 'Line', 'best', 'film', 'year', 'Simple', 'acting', 'directing', 'carry', 'movie', 'far', 'heart', 'Even', 'camera', 'work', 'nothing', 'ordinary', 'other', 'aspects', 'are', 'enough', 'keep', 'film', 'afloat', 'film', 'truly', 'audiences', 'compassion', 'care', 'Johnny', 'ever', 'dieing', 'devotion', 'sassy', 'June', 'Carter', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'may', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'most', 'handsome', 'man', 'most', 'courageous', 'what', 'physically', 'made', 'up', 'one', 'strongest', 'hearts', 'music', 'soul', 'humanity.4.5/5']",Walk the Line
637282,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00005JO1R,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[2, 2]","I need to listen to more Johnny Cash.  I haven't heard much of his music, but after seeing Walk The Line, which shows his rise, fall, and rebirt, I realize that I am missing out.Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) grew up on a farm.  His father Ray (Robert Patrick) always liked Johnny's older brother more, seeing Johnny as good for nothing, and throwing his life away listening to the Carter family sing on the radio.  After Johnny's brother died, Ray blamed Johnny.While in the air force, Cash began writing songs about being in prison, despite having never been incarcerated himself.  Upon his return to the States, he married his childhood sweetheart Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), despite her father's protests and fears that Cash wouldn't be able to provide for her.  And at first, he can't.  He is too preoccupied with becoming a music star that he can't concentrate on his door-to-door sales job.  Finally, he decides to take his band, which, according to Vivian, is composed of two mechanics who can't play well, to a recording studio run by Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts), owner of Sun Records.  Some of the other artists Phillips signed include Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton), Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne), and Waylon Jennings (Shooter Jennings).  While on tour, Johnny meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), who was one of his idols while growing up.  She still sings, but she also performs comedy sideshow routines between the ""real"" musicians.  As Johnny and June get to know each other while they tour together, an attraction forms between them, and they become best friends.  While this is fine for June, who is also married, Johnny wants more.  Soon, he also gets into drugs, which eventually get him kicked off a tour when he forgets the lyrics to his songs and kicks out the footlights on stage.  Meanwhile, his homelife continues to get worse.  Vivian isn't very supportive of him during his dark days (I'm told that the real Vivan Cash was more supportive than portrayed here, but I guess the film needed to make a few adjustments for the purposes of drama), and she becomes very jealous of June's relationship with her husband.  Eventually, Johnny drives away everyone he loves; his wife, his three daughters, and his band.  The only person who sticks by him during his darkest times is June.While I'm sure that some of the events were a little embellished (as I already said, Vivan's character was a little off), these are all real events and they are as exciting as even some the best fictional love stories.  June's committment to her best friend is amazing, and Johnny's struggle, while not unique, is definitely trying for everyone involved.Phoenix and Witherspoon deserve special recognition for their performances here.  Both of them nailed their characters so well.  Phoenix was able to perfectly imitate Cash's trademark deep voice and both of them did their own singing!  Every actor involved did very well, but these two were amazing.  It's too bad that Witherspoon gets stuck in so many silly romantic comedies, because she is truly wasting her talent in them.Biopics aren't my favorite genre of films, but this one stands out as one of the greatest I've ever seen.

637292,A3HWCK7TSEBR3P,B00005JO1R,"A Sacramento Reader ""Sacto-Skeptic""","[6, 17]","Johnny Cash is the only country music performer I like.  I have five of his CDs.  Ever since I heard about WALK THE LINE, it was at the top of my Must Do list.  However, this movie seems like a deliberate attempt to assassinate his reputation.  It dwells on all of his negative aspects without truly letting his better qualities shine.First off, there's the question of Joaquinn Phoenix.  For comparison's sake, let's realize that any actor taking on the role of a real and phenomenal man or woman is facing a daunting challenge.  We already have certain images burned into our brains.  We have seen, heard, and read about these people.  That being said, George C. Scott was Patton.  Denzel Washington was Malcolm X.  Jamie Foxx was Ray Charles.  Joaquin Phoenix was ... a pretty good imitation of Johnny Cash.  He never quite sounds like Cash, and he never quite establishes Cash's commanding presence.Second, Cash was no angel, and this aspect of his character is in the movie.  However, it's most, if not all, of the movie.  His womanizing, his drinking, and his drug addiction are all there.  But where is his struggle to become a singer?  Where is his struggle to master music itself?  Judging by this movie, Cash pretty much was a master singer and musician from the first moment he attempted both.Third and most importantly, when the time came to turn his life around, according to the movie, the decision to do so was made by other people.  The will to achieve his transformation also came from others.  He was just along for the ride, without any determination of his own.On the positive side, Reese Witherspoon becomes June Carter.  Also, unlike RAY, we see the negative affects on others from Cash's self-destructive behavior.  The problem is that by the end of the movie, Cash has been portrayed as a man of unsubstantial courage, unsubstantial will, unsubstantial intellect, and unsubstantial compassion.  He's little more than an Arkansas hick with money.I have no doubts that Joaquin Phoenix will win an award for his performance, and the film itself will win awards, because that's the kind of thing Hollywood likes:  People who can't do anything for themselves and who must let others straighten them out.  Unfortunately, there's a depth to Cash's music that is not attainable by the person portrayed in this film.",2,Massively Disappointed,1134172800,"12 10, 2005",2005,2331,"['Johnny', 'Cash', 'only', 'country', 'music', 'performer', 'have', 'five', 'CDs', 'Ever', 'heard', 'WALK', 'THE', 'LINE', 'was', 'top', 'Must', 'Do', 'list', 'However', 'movie', 'deliberate', 'attempt', 'assassinate', 'reputation', 'negative', 'aspects', 'truly', 'letting', 'better', 'qualities', 'shine.First', 'off', 'question', 'Joaquinn', 'Phoenix', 'comparison', 'sake', 'let', 'realize', 'actor', 'taking', 'role', 'real', 'phenomenal', 'man', 'woman', 'facing', 'daunting', 'challenge', 'already', 'have', 'certain', 'images', 'burned', 'brains', 'have', 'seen', 'heard', 'read', 'people', 'being', 'said', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'was', 'Patton', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'was', 'Malcolm', 'X.', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'was', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'imitation', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'never', 'quite', 'Cash', 'never', 'quite', 'Cash', 'commanding', 'presence.Second', 'Cash', 'was', 'angel', 'aspect', 'character', 'movie', 'However', 'most', 'not', 'movie', 'womanizing', 'drinking', 'drug', 'addiction', 'are', 'there', 'where', 'struggle', 'become', 'singer', 'Where', 'struggle', 'master', 'music', 'Judging', 'movie', 'Cash', 'pretty', 'much', 'was', 'master', 'singer', 'musician', 'first', 'moment', 'attempted', 'both.Third', 'most', 'importantly', 'when', 'time', 'came', 'turn', 'life', 'around', 'according', 'movie', 'decision', 'do', 'so', 'was', 'made', 'other', 'people', 'will', 'achieve', 'transformation', 'also', 'came', 'others', 'was', 'just', 'along', 'ride', 'determination', 'own.On', 'positive', 'side', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'becomes', 'June', 'Carter', 'Also', 'RAY', 'see', 'negative', 'affects', 'others', 'Cash', 'self-destructive', 'behavior', 'problem', 'end', 'movie', 'Cash', 'been', 'portrayed', 'man', 'unsubstantial', 'courage', 'unsubstantial', 'will', 'unsubstantial', 'intellect', 'unsubstantial', 'compassion', 'little', 'more', 'Arkansas', 'hick', 'money.I', 'have', 'doubts', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'will', 'win', 'award', 'performance', 'film', 'will', 'win', 'awards', 'kind', 'thing', 'Hollywood', 'likes', 'People', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'who', 'must', 'let', 'others', 'straighten', 'out', 'Unfortunately', 'depth', 'Cash', 'music', 'not', 'attainable', 'person', 'portrayed', 'film']",Walk the Line

637295,A3FVAWZNKW9GX,B00005JO1R,"A.Trendl HungarianBookstore.com ""What should ...","[4, 7]","The short reply to describing ""Walk the Line"" is that it is a solid, real-life story of redemption, of a man who finds out who he is and sings from his heart. The story of Johnny Cash's life is told well, sung well, and produced well.Johnny Cash's life is one spared of the consequences of his worst mistakes. When his first wife left him after realizing Johnny's character was in question, when drugs and affairs began to ruin him, he found June. When drugs and alcohol took him down, he found his soul and his way back up.""Walk the Line"" covers the transformation of a child blamed for his brother's accidental death, the drive to succeed as a gospel singer, and the desire to be loved without restrictions.I like Johnny Cash. Always have. His voice sounded off-the-cuff, like someone called him on stage unexpectedly. It is rough, resonant with tobacco and alcohol strained vocal cords, with enough twang to keep it country and enough power to keep it rock. All of these come through adequately in Joaquin Phoenix's attempts, but he's no Johnny Cash. That's a tough act to follow, and I give Phoenix credit for as much as he pulls off musically.Beyond my thoughts of Phoenix's mediocre singing, I give him applause for acting. Not only does he have Cash's signature talking from the side of his mouth, but he has the attitude, the stare, the characteristics that remind me of the Johnny Cash seen on TV throughout the years.Reese Witherspoon delivers a persona of June Carter that is extraordinarily sweet. It has to believe she went through so many marriages before finally settling on Johnny. She sings well, and to the ear who has not heard the original, she's enjoyable. The comparison between the two is not fair: one is a musical icon, and the other is only portraying the icon.As storytelling goes, the movie ends in the late 1960s. Johnny and June's life is summed up with that they lived happily ever after. It misses the complete transition, where Johnny's broken life appears to have been a dream, where he goes on to sing more great songs, and even sings for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association crusades.To compare the three recent biopics I have seen, this is the best. While ""Ray"" is powerful, Ray Charles' own life only evolves. It never transforms. He is only a great singer and a good man at the end. Johnny becomes a great man after not being much of one.In ""Beyond the Sea,"" it lacks by comparison because, partly, Bobby Darin's life was shorter and less dramatic, and also, Cash's catalog of hits is volumes larger.By the end of ""Beyond the Sea,"" I was tired of a few songs. In ""Walk the Line,"" I kept thinking, ""Where's 'Don't Take Your Guns To Town,' 'Guess Things Happen That Way,' and 'Sunday Morning Coming Down'? What about 'A Boy Named Sue'?"" I wanted more music. Those are fantastic, but the movie's director could not use them all.Shaky parts of the movie are found in how it seems Johnny's spiral downward always held to a glimmer that he was a good man making bad choices. However true that is, it came off whitewashing some of the uglier sides of his hard times, and missed an opportunity to show why his songs have credibility.See it in the theater to enjoy their sound system while you still can.I fully recommend ""Walk the Line.""Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com",5,"Love, Life Hurts But Johnny is Redeemed",1139616000,"02 11, 2006",2006,3317,"['short', 'reply', 'describing', 'Walk', 'Line', 'solid', 'real-life', 'story', 'redemption', 'man', 'who', 'out', 'who', 'sings', 'heart', 'story', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'life', 'told', 'well', 'sung', 'well', 'produced', 'well.Johnny', 'Cash', 'life', 'one', 'spared', 'consequences', 'worst', 'mistakes', 'When', 'first', 'wife', 'left', 'realizing', 'Johnny', 'character', 'was', 'question', 'when', 'drugs', 'affairs', 'began', 'ruin', 'found', 'June', 'When', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'took', 'down', 'found', 'soul', 'way', 'back', 'up', 'Walk', 'Line', 'transformation', 'child', 'blamed', 'brother', 'accidental', 'death', 'drive', 'succeed', 'gospel', 'singer', 'desire', 'be', 'loved', 'restrictions.I', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Always', 'have', 'voice', 'sounded', 'off-the-cuff', 'someone', 'called', 'stage', 'unexpectedly', 'rough', 'resonant', 'tobacco', 'alcohol', 'strained', 'vocal', 'cords', 'enough', 'twang', 'keep', 'country', 'enough', 'power', 'keep', 'rock', 'come', 'adequately', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'attempts', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'tough', 'act', 'follow', 'give', 'Phoenix', 'credit', 'as', 'much', 'musically.Beyond', 'thoughts', 'Phoenix', 'mediocre', 'singing', 'give', 'applause', 'acting', 'Not', 'only', 'have', 'Cash', 'signature', 'talking', 'side', 'mouth', 'attitude', 'stare', 'characteristics', 'remind', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'seen', 'TV', 'years.Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'delivers', 'persona', 'June', 'Carter', 'extraordinarily', 'sweet', 'believe', 'went', 'so', 'many', 'marriages', 'finally', 'settling', 'Johnny', 'well', 'ear', 'who', 'not', 'heard', 'original', 'enjoyable', 'comparison', 'two', 'not', 'fair', 'one', 'musical', 'icon', 'other', 'only', 'portraying', 'icon.As', 'storytelling', 'movie', 'late', '1960s', 'Johnny', 'June', 'life', 'summed', 'up', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'complete', 'transition', 'where', 'Johnny', 'broken', 'life', 'have', 'been', 'dream', 'where', 'sing', 'more', 'great', 'songs', 'even', 'sings', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'Evangelistic', 'Association', 'crusades.To', 'compare', 'three', 'recent', 'biopics', 'have', 'seen', 'best', 'Ray', 'powerful', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'own', 'life', 'only', 'never', 'only', 'great', 'singer', 'good', 'man', 'end', 'Johnny', 'great', 'man', 'not', 'being', 'much', 'one.In', 'Sea', 'comparison', 'partly', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'life', 'was', 'shorter', 'less', 'dramatic', 'also', 'Cash', 'catalog', 'hits', 'volumes', 'end', 'Beyond', 'Sea', 'was', 'tired', 'few', 'songs', 'Walk', 'Line', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Where', ""'Do"", ""n't"", 'Take', 'Guns', 'Town', ""'Guess"", 'Things', 'Happen', 'Way', ""'Sunday"", 'Morning', 'Coming', 'Down', 'What', 'A', 'Boy', 'Named', 'Sue', 'wanted', 'more', 'music', 'are', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'director', 'could', 'not', 'use', 'all.Shaky', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'found', 'how', 'Johnny', 'spiral', 'downward', 'always', 'held', 'glimmer', 'was', 'good', 'man', 'making', 'bad', 'choices', 'However', 'true', 'came', 'off', 'whitewashing', 'uglier', 'sides', 'hard', 'times', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'show', 'why', 'songs', 'have', 'credibility.See', 'theater', 'enjoy', 'sound', 'system', 'still', 'can.I', 'fully', 'recommend', 'Line', 'Anthony', 'Trendleditor', 'HungarianBookstore.com']",Walk the Line

Playing ""spot the future icon"" is a lot of fun when, say, Elvis is recording his demo song (one that few music fans would immediately recognize) or offering young Johnny Cash some uppers, in a moment of dubious historical reality, but great foreshadowing for the King of Rock and Roll.Likewise, while the music isn't quite as good as the originals -- sometimes dramatically not as good -- it's credible enough and a lot of fun to listen to.The film's heart, though, is Witherspoon, who conveys with a glance knowing Joaquin Phoenix's Cash for years, not the months the film took to make, and who subtly portrays a woman older than herself without relying on ridiculous special effects makeup or dialogue cues. Her portrayal of ""the other woman"" agonizing over her place in Cash's marriage is believable and touching.

This movie offered me nothing further that I didn't already know and even did a poor job doing it, didn't entertain me in any way I cared to in relation to J.Cash, and I found it merely a stepping stone for it's actors. Anymore, you do a great impersonation of a famous celebrity or historical figure, you change yourself form a supermodel to a loathesome murderer (see C.Tiegs in ""Monster"") and you have the Academy and movie goers talking about you as if you just invented celluloid. This movie is okay for those who didn't necessarily grow up on J.Cash. To those who've followed him for decades, even subjected to ridicule for doing so by the very folks who now claim J.Cash fanaticism in hindsight, this movie just didn't do it for me. As far as Phoenix, this isn't even his best role. I liked him better in ""Inventing the Abbotts"" much better than this one (I actually liked that movie better than this one, but that's another debate.) In short, this is one of those, ""the audience loves the movie for who's in it."" I can't sit through more than 10 minutes of this masquerade.

June Carter fan as a kid, June Carter lover as an adult, and a drug addict for a good portion of his life. Who can forget the scene when Joaquin Phoenix improvised and ripped the sink out of his wall in a rage? And who can forget when June Carter's parents finally tried to sober Johnny up? The drug dealer comes to Johnny's front door and gets a sawed off shotgun barrel jammed into his chest by June's father. Then June's mother, dressed in Sunday best, comes out of the house with HER sawed off shotgun, trained on the drug dealer.Bottom Line: Joaquin and Reese do a phenomenal job singing Cash and Carter's songs, and also do a phenomenal job playing their parts.

Phoenix and Witherspoon are far more inspired than one can imagine. They pay exquisite homage to these deceased legends. It makes you want to go back and watch every documentary ever made just so you can experience the real thing. Phoenix had the great man's every idiosyncrasy down, and the way he hunches his shoulders up as he struts around during live performances was almost eerie. Outside of individual performances, the film itself was rather erratic. One should understand in advance though that this is not the life and times of Johnny Cash. It is his life in the context of his relationship with June Carter which makes it far less interesting than it otherwise would be.

Specifically, several scenes expand on the relationships amongst the main characters, from showing Cash's first encounters with Jerry Lee Lewis and the Carter family to providing glimpses into tender moments between Cash and his first wife.

My father started collecting his albums (8-tracks actually) and whenever we were on the road he'd pop one in and we'd listen to I Walk The Line or Ring Of Fire or Folsom Prison Blues; those were the main ones anyway. My dad wasn't a big music fan back then - he was extremely selective - but Cash was his exception. Not knowing what Johnny's music was all about, I really didn't give much thought as to why my father should or shouldn't like the singer (""He sings real good, doesn't he Dad?"" ""Yes he does""). This might seem more like a family reminiscence on my part but humor me for just one more minute.My father was pretty conservative: he paid his taxes on time without question, was a Marine, believed in the death penalty, enjoyed any kind of sports, and coached in a Pop-Warner football league.Fast forward to this movie, Walk The Line, and I have to wonder why my father felt so strongly for this man's music. Johnny Cash was anything but conservative. Joaquin Phoenix's excellent portrayal of Mr. Cash - from his humble beginnings on an Arkansas farm to his nearly fatal brush with amphetamine addiction - shows us all the flaws this incredibly gifted man had balled up inside him. He drank like a fish, womanized while on tour, supported better living standards for prison inmates (something my father would NEVER agree with), and enjoyed the rock-a-billy sounds that were just emerging onto the airwaves. Cash's worldviews were fairly extreme and this spilled over into the lyrics for his songs (just listen to his best-selling At Folsom Prison album and you'll see what I mean).So what was it about Johnny Cash that pulled my dad into his fandom?Well, this movie shows us. Johnny Cash's voice (""Like a freight train coming `round a bend but sharp as a razor"") is hypnotic, and Mr. Phoenix deserves all of the notoriety he's received for playing this role. It's stunning to learn that Joaquin didn't lip-sync any of the songs, but sung them all himself. And although Johnny Cash's voice was a bit coarser and deeper, Mr. Phoenix should be congratulated for his singing talent. He amazed me.The shining light in the movie, however, was Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. Who could've guessed that this Legally Blonde comedic talent could act so dramatically? Her singing voice was wonderful, too, doing all of June Carter's songs without lip-syncing ... just as Joaquin had.But I do have two complaints. First, I didn't much care for the ending. I felt it was abrupt and tried too hard to tie everything up into a nice ""family package"" in just a few minutes. Second (although not really a complaint but more of a comparison) is that there've been some really great character films done in the past few years, and although Walk The Line ranks right up there with the best of them, I felt that Jamie Foxx did a bit better job in Ray (but I think overall Walk The Line was better as entertainment).Still, this is a great movie with excellent filming and information about an American icon of the music industry.

Fairbanks""","[3, 3]","Joaquin Phoenix probably would have won the Oscar for his portrayal of Johnny Cash in ""Walk the Line"" if only Jamie Foxx hadn't won the prize a year earlier for playing Ray Charles. The Oscars didn't want to look like the Grammys, so they gave the golden guy to Philip Seymour Hoffman for a less complex performance as Truman Capote.Phoenix is better, though (and does his own singing), and director James Mangold, in a commentary, praises the actor unabashedly. One of the most memorable scenes has Cash watching from the wings as Elvis Presley (played by Tyler Hilton) wows a crowd of screaming teenagers. Without uttering a single word, Phoenix conveys a range of emotions. At first, he's admiring. Then he appears momentarily jealous of qualities Elvis has that are lacking in his own performance. Finally, he shakes off any feelings of envy he may have and is once more admiring, much too impressed with his colleague to let petty feelings intrude.Biopics tend to follow a too predictable path, an unavoidable template when dealing with the kind of lives considered worthy of cinematic treatment. There's the early life and its troubles often depicted as providing the impetus for the subject's later success. There's the scene in which the hero discovers his talent or calling and struggles to effectively develop or present it to whomever (in this case, Sun Records' producer Sam Phillips) holds the power to bring it to the world. Then you've got the predictable rise and, sometimes, the fall. ""Walk the Line"" doesn't stray from the formula yet makes the cliches of the genre seem fresh because they allow Johnny Cash to appear not merely as a legend, an almost Mount Rushmore figure in popular music, but as a man full of doubts about his talent and his soul, and Phoenix captures him superbly.Cash never really had a downfall comparable to Elvis Presley's, but he struggled with addiction, only overcoming his demons through the love of June Carter. He had career setbacks, but the film ends before Cash was dumped from the Columbia label and also stops short of detailing his eventual return to glory through the series of brooding recordings he made for producer Rick Rubin's American Recordings. It's a fine, superbly realized film, a testament to both the legend of its subject, and to the talents of its stars.Brian W.

637320,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00005JO1R,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[3, 4]","Nominated for five Academy Awards, and winner of the Oscar for Best Actress (Reese Witherspoon), Walk The Line chronicles the life and times of legendary country music star Johnny Cash with an intense, and sometimes dark, intimacy. Following on the heels of the previous year's Oscar Award-winning picture Ray, based on the life of Ray Charles, I entered the theater under the mistaken impression that Walk The Line would be a cookie-cutter attempt to capitalize on the various themes of that picture's commercial success. But although the dramatic personal struggle with drug addiction is prevalent in both films, Walk The Line was more than able to stand on its own as a powerful and impressionable big screen biography. And just like the aforementioned film, you leave Walk The Line with a renewed interest in the music of Johnny Cash and a deep personal attachment to the lives of Cash and his likeable wife, June Carter.Directed by James Mangold, the talent behind such notable films as Kate & Leopold (2001) and Identity (2003), Walk The Line begins in the rough and tumble world of Depression-Era Arkansas where a young Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) tends to the family cotton farm with his parents and older brother. Early on, a family tragedy strains the relationship between Cash and his father, providing a glimpse into the epic moment that would shape his life forever. Soon after, the film jumps to the early 1950s where Cash perfects his guitar talents while stationed overseas in the Air Force. His marriage to high school classmate Vivian Liberto lands the two in Memphis where Johnny supports the family as an appliance salesman while pursuing his musical interests on the side. Here, Cash founds The Tennessee Two with bassist Marshall Grant (Larry Bagby) and guitarist Luther Perkins (Dan John Miller), and the trio plays its way to a music deal with local label Sun Records.As part of a promotional campaign, Cash is put on tour with other ""rockabilly"" newcomers Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton), Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne), and Carl Perkins (Johnny Holiday). But during his tour with the quartet, the life of Johnny Cash takes numerous turns. He meets the affable June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), begins an addiction to amphetamines and alcohol, and watches his marriage to Vivian deteriorate under the strain of his constant absence. All three would come to define the next fifteen years of Cash's life as he struggled to triumph over his personal demons. Despite his all-encompassing drug addiction, Cash nevertheless manages to crank out hits, but his personal life hits rock bottom following bouts with divorce, loneliness, depression, and his continued drug addiction. When Cash reunites with June Carter in a musical collaboration, the magical bond between the two is amplified. But Johnny's addiction threatens to ruin everything they've built together...The most impressive aspect of Walk The Line, aside from the storyline itself, is the performance of Witherspoon and her counterpart Phoenix. Amazingly, both provide their own voiceovers, and for the casual listener, very little difference can be detected between the Hollywood talents and the real life country music legends they impersonate. Much was made of the performance of Joaquin Phoenix in the days leading up to the film's release, but I came away more impressed by Witherspoon. Apparently, so did the Academy because they awarded her their highest honor for the role. What stood out the most was the actress's down-to-earth smile and charismatic mannerisms. She created a character with ample assertiveness, yet one that burst at the seams with an infectious optimism and love for life. As such, the audience can't help but fall in love with June Carter. In addition, Witherspoon displays an amazing singing voice that accurately captures the distinct and unique aspects of June Carter's talent. Overall, Walk The Line is a fine film, and a fitting remembrance to the career and life of country music's greatest icon, Johnny Cash...",5,"Not an elite film, but one of the best of the year...",1146182400,"04 28, 2006",2006,4025,"['Nominated', 'five', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'winner', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Walk', 'Line', 'life', 'times', 'legendary', 'country', 'music', 'star', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'intense', 'sometimes', 'dark', 'intimacy', 'Following', 'heels', 'previous', 'year', 'Oscar', 'Award-winning', 'picture', 'Ray', 'based', 'life', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'entered', 'theater', 'mistaken', 'impression', 'Walk', 'Line', 'would', 'be', 'cookie-cutter', 'attempt', 'capitalize', 'various', 'themes', 'picture', 'commercial', 'success', 'dramatic', 'personal', 'struggle', 'drug', 'addiction', 'prevalent', 'films', 'Walk', 'Line', 'was', 'more', 'able', 'stand', 'own', 'powerful', 'impressionable', 'big', 'screen', 'biography', 'just', 'aforementioned', 'film', 'leave', 'Walk', 'Line', 'renewed', 'interest', 'music', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'deep', 'personal', 'attachment', 'lives', 'Cash', 'likeable', 'wife', 'June', 'Carter.Directed', 'James', 'Mangold', 'talent', 'such', 'notable', 'films', 'Kate', 'Leopold', '2001', 'Identity', '2003', 'Walk', 'Line', 'rough', 'tumble', 'world', 'Depression-Era', 'Arkansas', 'where', 'young', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'family', 'cotton', 'farm', 'parents', 'older', 'brother', 'Early', 'family', 'tragedy', 'relationship', 'Cash', 'father', 'providing', 'glimpse', 'epic', 'moment', 'would', 'shape', 'life', 'forever', 'Soon', 'film', 'jumps', 'early', '1950s', 'where', 'Cash', 'guitar', 'talents', 'stationed', 'overseas', 'Air', 'Force', 'marriage', 'high', 'school', 'classmate', 'Vivian', 'Liberto', 'two', 'Memphis', 'where', 'Johnny', 'family', 'appliance', 'salesman', 'pursuing', 'musical', 'interests', 'side', 'Here', 'Cash', 'Tennessee', 'Two', 'bassist', 'Marshall', 'Grant', 'Larry', 'Bagby', 'guitarist', 'Luther', 'Perkins', 'Dan', 'John', 'Miller', 'trio', 'way', 'music', 'deal', 'local', 'label', 'Sun', 'Records.As', 'part', 'promotional', 'campaign', 'Cash', 'put', 'tour', 'other', 'rockabilly', 'newcomers', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'Tyler', 'Hilton', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'Waylon', 'Payne', 'Carl', 'Perkins', 'Johnny', 'Holiday', 'tour', 'quartet', 'life', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'numerous', 'turns', 'affable', 'June', 'Carter', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'addiction', 'amphetamines', 'alcohol', 'marriage', 'Vivian', 'deteriorate', 'strain', 'constant', 'absence', 'three', 'would', 'come', 'define', 'next', 'fifteen', 'years', 'Cash', 'life', 'struggled', 'triumph', 'personal', 'demons', 'all-encompassing', 'drug', 'addiction', 'Cash', 'nevertheless', 'crank', 'out', 'hits', 'personal', 'life', 'hits', 'rock', 'bottom', 'following', 'bouts', 'divorce', 'loneliness', 'depression', 'continued', 'drug', 'addiction', 'When', 'Cash', 'June', 'Carter', 'musical', 'collaboration', 'magical', 'bond', 'two', 'amplified', 'Johnny', 'addiction', 'ruin', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'built', 'together', 'most', 'impressive', 'aspect', 'Walk', 'Line', 'aside', 'storyline', 'performance', 'Witherspoon', 'counterpart', 'Phoenix', 'Amazingly', 'provide', 'own', 'voiceovers', 'casual', 'listener', 'very', 'little', 'difference', 'can', 'be', 'detected', 'Hollywood', 'talents', 'real', 'life', 'country', 'music', 'impersonate', 'Much', 'was', 'made', 'performance', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'days', 'leading', 'up', 'film', 'release', 'came', 'away', 'more', 'impressed', 'Witherspoon', 'Apparently', 'so', 'did', 'Academy', 'awarded', 'highest', 'honor', 'role', 'What', 'stood', 'out', 'most', 'was', 'actress', 'down-to-earth', 'smile', 'charismatic', 'mannerisms', 'created', 'character', 'ample', 'assertiveness', 'one', 'burst', 'seams', 'infectious', 'optimism', 'love', 'life', 'such', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'love', 'June', 'Carter', 'addition', 'Witherspoon', 'amazing', 'singing', 'voice', 'accurately', 'distinct', 'unique', 'aspects', 'June', 'Carter', 'talent', 'Overall', 'Walk', 'Line', 'fine', 'film', 'fitting', 'remembrance', 'career', 'life', 'country', 'music', 'greatest', 'icon', 'Johnny', 'Cash']",Walk the Line

Walk THE LINE 2 disc edition gave me the same reaction as the LORD OF WAR 2 disc, which was after I watched everything: ""That's it!?""... For example, on WTL there is an 11 minute 'featurette' on Cash's concert in Folsom Prison in 1968 and various recollections from Prison employees and his country singer friends.  What pictures do they show during all this? Scenes and photos from the movie! The actors portraying the real people. All the 'featurettes' are pretty much like that.  All these exclusive interviews that it mentions on the back of the DVD, these actors/musicians are barely in it, so somewhere there is more footage. If they are going to have something on the REAL Johnny Cash, why do they have to show the actors and not photos of the REAL Man in Black? Or interview/concert footage with the real Johnny Cash? How about throwing in the video for ""Hurt""? or a documentary about the man.  Disc 2 is what I call ""fluffy"", which is to say there's not much substance.  I wish I would've bought the much cheaper 1 disc because I found very little usefull or informative with Disc 2.  As far as the movie: great. terrific.  Easily one of my favorite movies.  Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were terrific and the singing was very good, particularily the song ""Time's a Wasting"", which curiously is not on the soundtrack CD.  The commentary by the director was good and it was nice to know that a majority of this movie is actually true.  The deleted scenes usually bore me on other movies, but these were pretty good and you'll catch John and June's real life Son(John Carter Cash) in a deleted scene as a disc jockey. I call this 'special collectors edition' the 2 disc Lazy movie makers and studios/quick price gouge DVD with mostly worthless special features edition. JARHEAD is coming out soon, and after WTL and LORD OF WAR(among others), I'm leary at the 2 different DVD versions on most movies now.

Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[1, 1]","WALK THE LINE is a great movie, well written and acted, and this FULL SCREEN DVD version has the Director's Commentary and Deleted Scenes, so there is no need to pay $5 or $10 extra for the bonus DVD of extras (available on the Special Edition version). They already put my favorite DVD extras on this basic version, as it should be--GOOD DEAL!The movie is fun, interesting, and emotional. I learned a lot about the life of Johnny Cash, and after seeing this film, I started to buy Johnny Cash CDs, DVDs, and books. This movie rekindled an interest in music which I had let fade out of my life for many years.The movie shows the life and times of Johnny Cash, from boyhood when a traumatic event begins his sad attitude towards life; onto becoming a hit music star, facing more temptations and evils, and finally settling down to a stable, drug-free lifestyle in the spotlight, married to June Carter.Reese Witherspoon won a Best Actress Academy Award Oscar for her role as June Carter Cash. Joaquin Phoenix should have won for Best Actor, but I think he lost due to Hollywood politics, (the previous year's winner went to an actor portraying the life of singer Ray Charles).The Director's Commentary on this DVD is very interesting, and he talks about many of the scenes, and planning the film with Johnny Cash before he passed away, and such. It is all very insightful, as to the movie making process for this film.The FULL SCREEN DVD version is pretty acceptable for WALK THE LINE. Some movies are best with widescreen, due to picture compositions that use the whole screen, but I get by just fine with the FULL SCREEN version, without ever noticing anything ""missing"" from the screen, due to the more square TV screen shape, which crops off the wider, rectangular movie screen picture composition.If you like this film, then I can also recommend the CD soundtrack, which rocks! If you are new to Johnny Cash's work, then I can recommend the single CD from American Records called THE LEGEND OF JOHNNY CASH, which has mostly ALL of his biggest songs, sounding GREAT, and a good price on amazon.com! My favorite Gospel CD from Johnny is GOSPEL GLORY. His best live CD is AT SAN QUENTIN. His best concert DVD is LIVE IN DENMARK 1971. My favorite Johnny Cash item is his 16 CD set of Johnny's spoken word reading of the HOLY BIBLE NEW TESTAMENT, very affordably priced from amazon.com.",5,"Great Movie!

If you love one or both you will probably enjoy the film. If you want to see a great movie..the two stars hold. The reason I viewed it was because I like a well done biography regardless of the genre or subject matter. Unfortunately, I found that this one lacks any major points of interest. Like hundreds of other famous men, Cash had trouble with women and much of it was his own fault. He got invovled with drugs, recovered, and then married the girl of his dreams. A nice love story but hardly enough to engage an audience for two hours. The movie could have done more with the theme. Both he and Loretta made a huge impact on country music. This movie failed to reflect on that larger context beyond showing screaming fans. In the end it is simply a love story that we have all seen before. To make matters worse, this movie doesn't just feature cuts from his songs, it is largely made up of performances interspersed with acting. While they do use a few songs to illustrate how Johnny and Loretta related on stage, this device seems just that...a device to allow us to hear his music while not completely forgetting about acting. In the end what sticks most strongly in my mind is how similar the melody of the songs were with the same foot thumping bass line at the core of each one. When songs go on so long that you wonder where the movie went you begin to think that the writer ran out of material.

Marriage is just another obstacle to get around.  See, if you've got a dream, and your spouse stands in the way (for example by suggesting that you pay some attention to her and help provide for your progeny), it's totally okay to dump her and latch on to someone more exciting, someone who believes in you.  Everything will be considered your wife's fault for having opposed your dream in the first place.(Johnny and Vivian's daughter, Rosanne Cash, was reportedly furious over this movie, claiming that her mother actually encouraged her father's music playing, the complete opposite of what is portrayed in the film.)Is it just me?  Has adultery and dishonoring one's marriage vows gone so completely out of fashion that filmmakers will portray a man callously ditching his wife and family, and yet not even seem aware of what they're showing?  The whole emphasis in this film was on how Johnny's spirit ""needed to be free"" so he could make his wonderful music.  Not a whiff of (or even a consciousness of) the moral problems presented by such behavior.Maybe I'm just getting older, but I'm getting sick of this crud.

I saw Johnny Cash. If Jamie Foxx won the Oscar in 2005 for RAY, the Joaquin should be a shoe in for 2006. He was truly amazing and should have won previously for GLADIATOR anyway.On the same note, Reese Witherspoon may have not captured the immitation like Joaquin did, but she captured the ESSENCE, the hesitation and Love that June had for Johnny and she is equally deserving to win.The film brings to light the uncontrollable hold that love has on a soul and captured some truly wondeful moments of devotion, friendship, loneliness and that sometimes, everyone needs a helping hand to get out of an abyss.Not to mention, captured some truly great musical performances. Joaquin Phoenix should get an oscar for the FOLSOM PRISON scene, ALONE!This is a true gem of a film that demonstrates that Love is like a magnet, and June and Johnny's lives were always entertwined, they just took different roads.The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is that biopics are inheritantly boring and not as interesting as we assume the persons life actually was. We see a childhood story of hardship and death... the rise to fame... the drugs... the women... the crash... the recovery... the music... huh, Johnny Cash and Ray Charles led the same life...It's a wonderful movie with OSCAR calibur performances, but the rock star life has been told before.",4,A drug induced Love Story,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,2043,"['was', 'review', 'here', 'agreed', 'completely', 'How', 'do', 'TRULY', 'tell', 'story', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'June', 'Carter', 'just', '2', 'hours', 'Well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'So', 'take', 'element', 'life', 'rise', 'fame', 'deaths', 'romance', 'tell', 'story.The', 'makers', 'WALK', 'THE', 'LINE', 'chose', 'tell', 'story', 'romance', 'how', 'came', 'about', 'finally', 'marry', 'other', 'Which', 'opinion', 'was', 'excellent', 'choice', 'was', 'thing', 'defined', 'most', 'was', 'thing', 'drove', 'made', 'who', 'were.Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'captured', 'JOHNNY', 'CASH', 'amazingly', 'Honestly', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'saw', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'won', 'Oscar', '2005', 'RAY', 'Joaquin', 'should', 'be', 'shoe', '2006', 'was', 'truly', 'amazing', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'previously', 'GLADIATOR', 'anyway.On', 'same', 'note', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'may', 'have', 'not', 'captured', 'immitation', 'Joaquin', 'did', 'captured', 'ESSENCE', 'hesitation', 'Love', 'June', 'had', 'Johnny', 'equally', 'deserving', 'win.The', 'film', 'brings', 'light', 'uncontrollable', 'hold', 'love', 'soul', 'captured', 'truly', 'wondeful', 'moments', 'devotion', 'friendship', 'loneliness', 'sometimes', 'everyone', 'helping', 'hand', 'get', 'abyss.Not', 'mention', 'captured', 'truly', 'great', 'musical', 'performances', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'should', 'get', 'oscar', 'FOLSOM', 'PRISON', 'scene', 'ALONE', 'true', 'gem', 'film', 'Love', 'magnet', 'June', 'Johnny', 'lives', 'were', 'always', 'entertwined', 'just', 'took', 'different', 'roads.The', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', '5', 'stars', 'biopics', 'are', 'inheritantly', 'boring', 'not', 'as', 'interesting', 'assume', 'persons', 'life', 'actually', 'was', 'see', 'childhood', 'story', 'hardship', 'death', 'rise', 'fame', 'drugs', 'women', 'crash', 'recovery', 'music', 'huh', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'led', 'same', 'life', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'OSCAR', 'calibur', 'performances', 'rock', 'star', 'life', 'been', 'told']",Walk the Line
637336,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B00005JO1R,Chris Luallen,"[3, 4]","""Walk the Line"" tells the story of country music star Johnny Cash from his early days until his marriage to June Carter in 1968. Joaquin Phoenix is terrific, capturing the mannerisms and singing style of Cash as well as any actor possibly could. Reese Witherspoon does a fine job as well. Her June Carter is a spunky, intelligent young woman who finally manages to provide Cash the solid grounding that he so desperately needs.I especially enjoyed the scenes of Johnny's childhood. The movie really captures the simplicity and hardship of life in rural Arkansas at this time. This boyhood period also includes the tragic death of his older brother, Jack. Johnny's guilt over not being there to save his brother from a sawmill accident provides the psychological background for much of what happens later in the movie.The film's most prominent musical focus is on Cash's early days as a rockabilly artist, hanging out with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and the boys. It's worth remembering that Johnny was a rebellious, young rocker before later returning to his country music roots. It was during these days that he first met and fell in love with June Carter. But she was newly divorced and he was still unhappily married. So they remained ""only friends"" for many years before admitting their passion and love for one another. But by this time Cash had become addicted to pharmaceutical drugs and June realized a successful marriage would be impossible. Finally, with the help of June and the Carter family, Johnny is able to quit taking the pills and get his life back on track. But, the now twice divorced, June is reluctant to marry again despite Johnny's desperate pleading. I found the ending, where June finally accepts Johnny's marriage proposal on stage to be improbable and a bit cheesy. But if that is how it really happened then that's how it had to be filmed.Overall ""Walk the Line"" is a terrific film about two extraordinary people. The music is great and if you are a Johnny Cash fan you will love listening to it.

637338,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JO1R,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 2]","The film is most likely going to get comparisons to Ray, the biopic about Ray Charles starring Oscar winner Jamie Foxx. That's unfortunate since personally I liked this film more. Granted you might find similarities with the films but only because the legend's lives just happened to go across similar paths. Ray to me would've fell apart if it wasn't for Jamie Foxx. Walk the Line meanwhile works with everything.After a quick clip of Folsom Prison concert, the films opens with Johnny Cash as a youngin living at home with his brother and parents. Johnny(called J.R) is out fishing while his brother works with a saw. An accident happens and his brother dies which only confirms that his father doesn't think much of him. The film then jumps to Johnny in the Air Force as he's starting to write music. He eventually starts writing and gets some popularity but the important part is he met June Carter, a divorced mother of 2. Johnny gets impulsive about his feelings which she rejects while trying to help him with his addictions.The film wins thanks to its 2 leads with Joaquin Phoenix pulling off a great portrayal of the Men in Black while Reese Witherspoon(who hasn't really done much well known dramatic work) brings a spunk to June. While you might listen to Ray's soundtrack which largely had Jamie Foxx lip synching, Joaquin and Reese did their own singing and while it's not dead on, it's quite impressive to hear them. Listening to ""I Walk the Line"" in the film was like wow, he's quite good.In a way it's probably one of the better examples of a real-life love story. Not big goo-goo eyes with the occasional fight, this has heartbreak, pain, anguish and everything else that goes along with. Johnny goes through so much to win her back and just as far when she rejects him. Unlike Ray which had multiple wives, here it's the affections for one while trying to deal with a less-than-happy other. We end up liking it more rather than just ""wife #3"".There's much to like about Walk the Line, from its performances to its rock music, it's a fascinating insight to a legend's life.",5,Music and talent coming together for one great movie,1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,2090,"['film', 'most', 'likely', 'going', 'get', 'comparisons', 'Ray', 'biopic', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'starring', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'unfortunate', 'personally', 'liked', 'film', 'more', 'Granted', 'might', 'find', 'similarities', 'films', 'only', 'legend', 'lives', 'just', 'happened', 'go', 'similar', 'paths', 'Ray', 'would', ""'ve"", 'fell', 'apart', 'was', ""n't"", 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Walk', 'Line', 'meanwhile', 'works', 'everything.After', 'quick', 'clip', 'Folsom', 'Prison', 'concert', 'films', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'youngin', 'living', 'home', 'brother', 'parents', 'Johnny', 'called', 'J.R', 'out', 'fishing', 'brother', 'saw', 'accident', 'happens', 'brother', 'only', 'father', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'film', 'then', 'Johnny', 'Air', 'Force', 'starting', 'write', 'music', 'eventually', 'writing', 'popularity', 'important', 'part', 'met', 'June', 'Carter', 'divorced', 'mother', '2', 'Johnny', 'impulsive', 'feelings', 'trying', 'help', 'addictions.The', 'film', 'thanks', '2', 'leads', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'pulling', 'off', 'great', 'portrayal', 'Men', 'Black', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'done', 'much', 'well', 'known', 'dramatic', 'work', 'spunk', 'June', 'might', 'listen', 'Ray', 'soundtrack', 'largely', 'had', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'lip', 'synching', 'Joaquin', 'Reese', 'did', 'own', 'singing', 'not', 'dead', 'quite', 'impressive', 'hear', 'Listening', 'Walk', 'Line', 'film', 'was', 'wow', 'quite', 'good.In', 'way', 'probably', 'one', 'better', 'examples', 'real-life', 'love', 'story', 'Not', 'big', 'goo-goo', 'eyes', 'occasional', 'fight', 'heartbreak', 'pain', 'anguish', 'everything', 'else', 'along', 'Johnny', 'so', 'much', 'win', 'back', 'just', 'far', 'when', 'Ray', 'had', 'multiple', 'wives', 'here', 'affections', 'one', 'while', 'trying', 'deal', 'less-than-happy', 'other', 'end', 'up', 'liking', 'more', 'rather', 'just', 'wife', '3', 'much', 'like', 'Walk', 'Line', 'performances', 'rock', 'music', 'fascinating', 'insight', 'legend', 'life']",Walk the Line

Walk the Line is the former, but it's amazing at what it does. It realistically and efficiently portrays the early life of The Man In Black, focusing on his relationship with June Carter before their marriage in 1968. It's a pretty standard story in rock star biopic terms (drug abuse, multiple marriages, infidelities), but Walk the Line rises above many of it's overcooked brethren in its simplicity, beautiful direction, and outstanding performances. James Mangold shot the film with the clarity most rock star biopics are missing and it's this quality that makes Walk the Line something special. As opposed to films like Oliver Stone's The Doors, which is both hazy and mystical, James Mangold's effort, with the help of DP Phedon Papamichael, wipes away the celebrity veneer with concise and intimate visuals. Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash is astounding. Never does a moment pass when the audience question's Phoenix's portrayal and he goes above and beyond to convince the viewers that he and Cash are one. His voice, his mannerisms, his looks, are pure Cash. Reese Witherspoon more than keeps up with her powerful co-star. She is a sympathetic beauty, much like June Carter, and she has the voice to boot. To undersell it, the chemistry between the two stars is totally engrossing. And of course, because it's a film about Johnny Cash, the music is lovely. In short, Walk the Line is an interesting story brought to life through a very talented cast and crew.

He hascrafted another flawed but interesting film, Walk The Line, named afterone of Cash's biggest musical hits; this one on the life of JohnnyCash. Actress Reese Witherspoon won an Oscar for Best Actress for herportrayal of Cash's wife June Carter Cash, of the famed Carter Familysingers, and while she's solid, competent, the award she won is merelyanother way for Hollywood to elevate the bankability of sexy youngstarlets- think Marissa Tomei, Mira Sorvino, Gwyneth Paltrow, JuliaRoberts, Angelina Jolie, Hilary Swank, Renee Zellwegger, CharlizeTheron, and now Witherspoon.

His framing and vistas do littleto enhance texture of the scenes, nor do they add an unconscious poeticelement. Despite globetrotting, Cash's life is portrayed as static anddull, and the love story is nothing great. What Mangold does not graspis that the real reason cash is worthy of a film is because of hissinging and songwriting. When will biopics about artists actually focuson the art, and not the soap operatic stuff? But, if they are going tofocus on the peripherals, one would think they'd play up thefascinating stuff, the legendary stuff, not the usual crap all peoplego through, for that merely shows that the subject is like the viewer,when the fascination stems from what the subject has that is NOT likethe average person.

637342,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B00005JO1R,Craig Connell,"[0, 0]","Watching this movie when I came out,it couldn't help but remind me, in a number of respects. to ""Ray,"" a film out a year earlier. Both were biographies of singers of a similar era, the main difference between the color of their skin, Ray being Ray Charles, of course, and this movie about Johnny Cash.Both singers (and films):1 - had a brother who died early on in their lives which affected them for years and years; 2 - were made to feel guilty about those deaths even though there was no reason for that guilt; 3 - had adulterous affairs as their singing careers began to take off; 4 - became addicted to drugs and beat that addiction; 5 - made bold decisions regarding their careers that went against prevailing thought but turned out to be the right decisions; 6 - movies featured outstanding music and slick photography; 7 - movies were fast-moving and interesting to view all the way through despite being over two hours long; 8 - featured wonderful acting performances.In Walk The Line, Joaquin Phoenix, who plays Cash, goes one up on Jamie Foxx, who played Charles, because Phoenix did his own singing....and he was very good. The same applies to Reese Witherspoon as ""June Carter."" Her singing talent surprised me. It makes the film all the more believable when you know the actors are actually singing.I am not familiar with Ginnifer Goodwin, who played Cash's first wife, but I think she gets unfairly ignored in the publicity of this film. Perhaps the biggest surprise was seeing Robert Patrick as Cash's father. Wasn't this the same young, trim villain in Terminator 2, which wasn't out that long ago? How can this be the same guy?!!I think this was the better of the two films, not just because of the realism but Charles seemed almost cold, no love in him, no commitment to any woman or his own kids, while Cash has a lot of more heart to him, even if it was misplaced at times.That seems to be the major theme of the WTL movie: the romance between Cash and Carter. Unfortunately, that's my only complaint about this film. This movie glamorizes this affair between Cash and Carter just a little too much, manipulating the audience to the point where we all want this couple to live happily ever after forgetting that Cash was married to another nice woman with two kids. Yeah, some of the ugly parts of adultery are shown but not to the degree the sweetness of this illicit romance is portrayed. The movie does not send a strong enough message that the right thing to do is for Cash to be a good father and husband in the first place and for Carter to stay away from him - period. The worst scene in the film might be Cash's two kids crying their eyes out watching their parents fight. Adultery always kills the kids more than anyone, which is one big reason I was sorry to see the Cash & Carter affair so romanticized.I'd have liked to have seen Cash's prison ministry detailed a little more since he was so faithful in that area, and his Christian testimony in general, which was very strong his last few decades, but the film didn't deal with those last three decades. Too bad, but understandable since there is just so much you can show in two hours. The filmmakers took the tried-and-true road of a romance story instead, which makes sense business-wise.With all the goods and bads, the film succeeds on being a great piece of entertainment with fantastic music, acting, visuals and a guarantee to please a lot of people, almost as many as Cash did in his eventful life.

However, I want to tell you that I liked it very much.  The movie portrays Cash as a very complex freight train of talent and emotion that is on some very loose and greased tracks ready to careen off a precipice at any moment.  The Cash in the movie had a certain kind of strength on stage, but off stage was something more like a black hole of emotional needs.  Of course, some would say that someone who needs all that approbation on stage is likely going to keep need it when the curtain falls and the lights are off.Joaquin Phoenix does a remarkable job of pulling of this man's very unique look and sound and facial expressions.  But it is more than a simple imitation or even ""channeling"" Cash as so many have said.  You can look at the actor's face and tell what Cash is feeling and trying to put into thoughts and when he fails to find the right thoughts, he erupts in frustration.  Just a superb job of acting and a tribute to Cash.Ginnifer Goodwin does a fine job in making Cash's first wife sympathetic, understandable, and yet never quite a victim.  We understand why the marriage broke down and why it started badly with different expectations from two very different people.  However, Cash's vast emotional needs and charisma seems to have drawn her in, but the pressures and storms that come with the huge fame Cash gained are not compatible with the kind of domesticity Vivian wanted.The person that Cash finally met, wanted, and needed as June Carter.  She had her own baggage coming from ""Country Music Royalty"" and a couple of bad marriages.  However, she seems to have had greater intellectual clarity and was probably smarter than Johnny Cash.  Reese Witherspoon gives a wonderful performance that wins our sympathy and helps focus our own attitudes towards the storms in Cash's life at any given moment in the film.Robert Patrick and Shelby Lynne add just the right touches as Cash's parents Ray and Carrie Cash.  Patrick has to provide the foundation for Cash's emotional insecurity and Lynne the music for him to cling to for emotional sustenance.This is a much better movie than I expected and I am glad that they left things complex and mixed rather than trying to turn this into a moralizing or cautionary story - though there are moral issues and cautionary lessons to draw aplenty.Enjoy.",5,A very good movie - much better than I had expected,1145059200,"04 15, 2006",2006,2479,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'taste', 'music', 'runs', 'Classical', 'am', 'not', 'likely', 'target', 'movie', 'However', 'want', 'tell', 'liked', 'very', 'much', 'movie', 'Cash', 'very', 'complex', 'freight', 'train', 'talent', 'emotion', 'very', 'loose', 'greased', 'tracks', 'ready', 'careen', 'off', 'precipice', 'moment', 'Cash', 'movie', 'had', 'certain', 'kind', 'strength', 'stage', 'stage', 'was', 'something', 'more', 'black', 'hole', 'emotional', 'needs', 'course', 'would', 'say', 'someone', 'who', 'approbation', 'stage', 'likely', 'going', 'keep', 'need', 'when', 'curtain', 'falls', 'lights', 'are', 'off.Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'remarkable', 'job', 'pulling', 'man', 'very', 'unique', 'look', 'sound', 'facial', 'expressions', 'more', 'simple', 'imitation', 'even', 'channeling', 'Cash', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'said', 'can', 'look', 'actor', 'face', 'tell', 'what', 'Cash', 'feeling', 'trying', 'put', 'thoughts', 'when', 'find', 'right', 'thoughts', 'frustration', 'Just', 'superb', 'job', 'acting', 'tribute', 'Cash.Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'fine', 'job', 'making', 'Cash', 'first', 'wife', 'sympathetic', 'understandable', 'yet', 'never', 'quite', 'victim', 'understand', 'why', 'marriage', 'broke', 'down', 'why', 'started', 'badly', 'different', 'expectations', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'people', 'However', 'Cash', 'vast', 'emotional', 'needs', 'charisma', 'have', 'drawn', 'pressures', 'storms', 'come', 'huge', 'fame', 'Cash', 'gained', 'are', 'not', 'compatible', 'kind', 'domesticity', 'Vivian', 'person', 'Cash', 'finally', 'met', 'wanted', 'needed', 'June', 'Carter', 'had', 'own', 'baggage', 'coming', 'Country', 'Music', 'Royalty', 'couple', 'bad', 'marriages', 'However', 'have', 'had', 'greater', 'intellectual', 'clarity', 'was', 'probably', 'smarter', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'sympathy', 'focus', 'own', 'attitudes', 'storms', 'Cash', 'life', 'given', 'moment', 'film.Robert', 'Patrick', 'Shelby', 'Lynne', 'add', 'just', 'right', 'touches', 'Cash', 'parents', 'Ray', 'Carrie', 'Cash', 'Patrick', 'provide', 'foundation', 'Cash', 'emotional', 'insecurity', 'Lynne', 'music', 'cling', 'emotional', 'sustenance.This', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'expected', 'am', 'glad', 'left', 'things', 'complex', 'mixed', 'rather', 'trying', 'turn', 'moralizing', 'cautionary', 'story', 'are', 'moral', 'issues', 'cautionary', 'lessons', 'draw', 'aplenty.Enjoy']",Walk the Line

He is believeable and wears the Johnny Cash personality, carries himself off as Johnny and even sounds like him. His protrayal of Johnny's life and the struggles he had through life, were shown in such an authentic way. We see JR (Johnny Cash's nickname as a youngster) live a life no one should have to live as a child growing up. His father shows no qualms about the fact that he wishes JR had died, and not the older son. JR loved his brother and lives forever with the haunting fact that his father will never love him. Even later in life, the father proves to be a bitter man for many years, until life comes to terms for Johnny after he marries June Carter. The Carter family prove that love and understanding of others, even when most people give up on them, can conquer all. Wisdom, compassion and goodness flows from the Mother and Dad Carter, and you can't help but wish to have known them personally in your own life. Joaquin does a marvelous job in this movie.

Historic/Biographical Content: It gives you little dates and locations at various scenes so you can follow along and know what happens in which year. (very helpful). It also shows the death of his older brother, which causes him to suffer emotional heartache forever. It shows him singing in Folsom, which is my favorite scene. It shows him being addicted to, and overcoming, drugs. It shows him proposing to June several times. It shows lots of TRUE-TO-LIFE events in Johnny Cash's life.2.) The Music: I have to say this is the BEST aspect of the movie. Not only did Reese and Joaquin actually sing all songs in the movie, they also played the instruments. Their voices and talents are phenomenal! They hit EVERY note, EVERY time...no errors. Go pick up the soundtrack!3.) The Romance: You can tell, early in their friendship, that June and Johnny are attracted to one another. They cannot be together because of Johnny's wife and June's recent divorce. You can still see in the way they act, though, that they really do care for one another. I was sooo moved when they finally had sex. It was so sweet. Then, to see June help Johnny through his drug problems...that was the nicest aspect of their relationship, I think. In the end, when June finally accepts his proposal on stage and they kiss...I cried so hard.4.) Appropriateness: While this film has some drug usage and language, I still found it appropriate for the entire family. There is no violence (with the exception of Johnny's outburst early in the film, backstage). There was no nudity. (They had sex, but it cuts from them kissing to them laying in bed the next morning.)

637346,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B00005JO1R,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[1, 1]","It seems biographies of well known figures of the twentieth century have become an ever increasing source material for high drama (Ray, Beyond the Sea).  Singer and songwriter Johnny Cash and his true love June Carter are realized by some honest, heartfelt performances and vivid period settings in Walk the Line.  Directed by James Mangold (Girl Interrupted) from a screenplay by himself and Gill Dennis, the film draws material from autobiographies The Man in Black and Cash: An Autobiography.An impending concert by Johnny Cash at Folsom State Prison is the point the story begins as it flashes back to 1944 in the South where the struggling Cash family works on a plantation.  As a young boy, Johnny idolizes his older brother Jack and wishes for something special in life.  Their mother gives Johnny the love for singing hymns while their father (Robert Patrick) is an alcoholic, stern figure.  When tragedy strikes the family, an emotional, dark cloud hangs over Johnny (Joaquin Phoenix) through the years even as he serves military duty in Germany and begins to find solace in writing music.  He marries his sweetheart, Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), and the two have a family and struggle to stay afloat financially while Johnny tinkers with gospel music and forms a trio.  When a fateful audition starts badly, he reverts to his more personal, angry music, and the rest is history.  Johnny begins cutting records, dressing in his fabled black outfits, and touring with the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon).  Cash begins an infatuation and life long obsession for June who is also married at the time.  Before long, Cash develops a dependency on drugs with unfortunate results.  His career at a crossroads and his home life a shambles, he descends into a self-destructive path with only June Carter as his true love and salvation.Let's face it, the reason for seeing this film is to see how good the performances are by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, and they deliver the goods. There is definitely chemistry between the two especially in their duets as both of them show vocal abilities by singing their own songs (as in films like Coal Miner's Daughter and The Buddy Holly Story).  It would require a strong actor to play a legend, and Phoenix proves to be adept.  He gets his vocals in a deep, low range to the point you are convinced that he is young Johnny Cash!  Kudos should also go to Witherspoon who also shows a gift for warbling with a country twang and acting all at once, not a feat to be taken lightly.  Goodwin shines in her moments as the first Mrs. Cash, and it's a shame we don't see more of her in the film.The concert scenes are restaged with authenticity while simultaneously involving us with fluid close-ups and sharp cutting.  It's nice to hear some famous songs recreated for today's audience.  Even if you weren't a fan, the songs strike a memory chord regardless.  Like Ray, Walk the Line shows how familial loss can have a lasting impact creatively and emotionally.  The story manages to move ahead a few years at a time and important moments are rendered realistically.  It is amusing in these pop music biographies to see a Who's Who of Rock n' Roll greats in their career infancies.  Just seeing Cash pal around with the likes of Lewis, Presley, and others is fascinating.  A lot of ground is covered in a little over two hours, but it doesn't feel too episodic.What the film captures successfully is the affect that his music had on prison inmates and how an overwhelming amount of his fan mail was attributed to prisoners who felt that he spoke to them.  (Watch for a cameo by co-producer James Keach as the prison warden.)  Cash was a man of the people, and the film takes great pains to show that Cash was not perfect and in fact very human.  He succumbs to the temptations of female groupies, gets addicted to drugs, goes to prison, and shows peculiar behavior as he obsesses with June.  Although he was smitten with her, Cash was instrumental in getting June into the spotlight to do solos and to stand equal with him.The film's momentum bogs down during Cash's downfall but redeems itself with scenes such as the Thanksgiving dinner in which Johnny confronts his father.  Among the movie's few flaws is the failure to develop the strained relationship between Cash and his intimidating father (well played by Patrick), and the resolution of the film with its family reunion doesn't ring true as one would have liked.  There is an amusing scene with June and her family scaring off a drug dealer who is trying to see Johnny.  More scenes like that would have been welcome.There will naturally be constant comparisons with Ray, but that shortchanges a film that would shine in any year.  OK, Ray might be a tad better and Coal Miner's Daughter is the gold standard, but Walk the Line does just fine and Phoenix is terrific.",4,Johnny Cash is Humanized in WALK THE LINE,1134604800,"12 15, 2005",2005,4915,"['biographies', 'well', 'known', 'figures', 'twentieth', 'century', 'have', 'become', 'ever', 'increasing', 'source', 'material', 'high', 'drama', 'Ray', 'Beyond', 'Sea', 'Singer', 'songwriter', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'true', 'love', 'June', 'Carter', 'are', 'realized', 'honest', 'heartfelt', 'performances', 'vivid', 'period', 'settings', 'Walk', 'Line', 'Directed', 'James', 'Mangold', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'screenplay', 'Gill', 'Dennis', 'film', 'material', 'Man', 'Black', 'Cash', 'Autobiography.An', 'impending', 'concert', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Folsom', 'State', 'Prison', 'point', 'story', 'back', '1944', 'South', 'where', 'struggling', 'Cash', 'family', 'plantation', 'young', 'boy', 'Johnny', 'older', 'brother', 'Jack', 'wishes', 'something', 'special', 'life', 'mother', 'Johnny', 'love', 'singing', 'hymns', 'father', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'alcoholic', 'stern', 'figure', 'When', 'tragedy', 'family', 'emotional', 'dark', 'cloud', 'hangs', 'Johnny', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'years', 'even', 'military', 'duty', 'Germany', 'find', 'solace', 'writing', 'music', 'sweetheart', 'Vivian', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'two', 'have', 'family', 'struggle', 'stay', 'afloat', 'financially', 'Johnny', 'tinkers', 'gospel', 'music', 'trio', 'When', 'fateful', 'audition', 'badly', 'more', 'personal', 'angry', 'music', 'rest', 'history', 'Johnny', 'cutting', 'records', 'dressing', 'fabled', 'black', 'outfits', 'touring', 'likes', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'June', 'Carter', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Cash', 'infatuation', 'life', 'long', 'obsession', 'June', 'who', 'also', 'married', 'time', 'long', 'Cash', 'dependency', 'drugs', 'unfortunate', 'results', 'career', 'crossroads', 'home', 'life', 'shambles', 'self-destructive', 'path', 'only', 'June', 'Carter', 'true', 'love', 'salvation.Let', 'face', 'reason', 'seeing', 'film', 'see', 'how', 'good', 'performances', 'are', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'deliver', 'goods', 'definitely', 'chemistry', 'two', 'especially', 'duets', 'show', 'vocal', 'abilities', 'singing', 'own', 'songs', 'films', 'Coal', 'Miner', 'Daughter', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'Story', 'would', 'require', 'strong', 'actor', 'play', 'legend', 'Phoenix', 'be', 'adept', 'vocals', 'deep', 'low', 'range', 'point', 'are', 'convinced', 'young', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Kudos', 'should', 'also', 'go', 'Witherspoon', 'who', 'also', 'gift', 'warbling', 'country', 'twang', 'acting', 'once', 'not', 'feat', 'be', 'taken', 'lightly', 'Goodwin', 'shines', 'moments', 'first', 'Mrs.', 'Cash', 'shame', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'more', 'film.The', 'concert', 'scenes', 'are', 'restaged', 'authenticity', 'simultaneously', 'involving', 'fluid', 'close-ups', 'sharp', 'cutting', 'nice', 'hear', 'famous', 'songs', 'recreated', 'today', 'audience', 'Even', 'were', ""n't"", 'fan', 'songs', 'strike', 'memory', 'chord', 'regardless', 'Ray', 'Walk', 'Line', 'how', 'familial', 'loss', 'can', 'have', 'lasting', 'impact', 'creatively', 'emotionally', 'story', 'move', 'ahead', 'few', 'years', 'time', 'important', 'moments', 'are', 'rendered', 'realistically', 'amusing', 'pop', 'music', 'biographies', 'see', 'Who', 'Who', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'greats', 'career', 'infancies', 'Just', 'seeing', 'Cash', 'pal', 'likes', 'Lewis', 'Presley', 'others', 'fascinating', 'lot', 'ground', 'covered', 'little', 'two', 'hours', ""n't"", 'feel', 'too', 'episodic.What', 'film', 'captures', 'successfully', 'affect', 'music', 'had', 'prison', 'inmates', 'how', 'overwhelming', 'amount', 'fan', 'mail', 'was', 'attributed', 'prisoners', 'who', 'felt', 'spoke', 'Watch', 'cameo', 'co-producer', 'James', 'Keach', 'prison', 'warden', 'Cash', 'was', 'man', 'people', 'film', 'great', 'pains', 'show', 'Cash', 'was', 'not', 'perfect', 'fact', 'very', 'human', 'temptations', 'female', 'groupies', 'addicted', 'drugs', 'prison', 'peculiar', 'behavior', 'June', 'was', 'smitten', 'Cash', 'was', 'instrumental', 'getting', 'June', 'spotlight', 'do', 'solos', 'stand', 'equal', 'him.The', 'film', 'momentum', 'bogs', 'down', 'Cash', 'downfall', 'scenes', 'such', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'Johnny', 'father', 'movie', 'few', 'flaws', 'failure', 'develop', 'strained', 'relationship', 'Cash', 'intimidating', 'father', 'well', 'played', 'Patrick', 'resolution', 'film', 'family', 'reunion', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'amusing', 'scene', 'June', 'family', 'scaring', 'off', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'trying', 'see', 'Johnny', 'More', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'welcome.There', 'will', 'naturally', 'be', 'constant', 'comparisons', 'Ray', 'film', 'would', 'shine', 'year', 'OK', 'Ray', 'might', 'be', 'tad', 'better', 'Coal', 'Miner', 'Daughter', 'gold', 'standard', 'Walk', 'Line', 'just', 'fine', 'Phoenix', 'terrific']",Walk the Line
637347,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B00005JO1R,Cubist,"[8, 8]","Capitalizing on the popularity of Ray , Walk the Line also chronicles the turbulent career and life of an iconic musician, applying the same plot structure - their lives have parallel arcs and hit the same dramatic beats. Like Ray Charles, Johnny Cash struggled with substance abuse but helped beat addiction with the help from the love of a good woman. Unlike Charles, who wanted to be loved by millions, Cash became successful on his own terms, turning his back on the country music industry when they failed to support him.Walk the Line is a fine, return to form for director James Mangold who started his career with the independent darling, Heavy and then followed it up with the star-studded crime drama, Cop Land. He peaked with the critically lauded Girl, Interrupted and then struggled to find quality material, coasting with entertaining but otherwise forgettable films like Kate and Leopold and Identity. Walk the Line is definitely a return to meatier, more substantial material.Joaquin Phoenix is a strong actor who has been in search of the right role and has finally found it with this movie. He has been miscast in strong films (Gladiator) and been good in weak movies (Ladder 49). Walk the Line is perfectly matched with his considerable talents. It's a daunting task for any actor to play a well-known public figure and even more so for an icon like Johnny Cash. Phoenix wisely doesn't try to do an imitation of Cash, opting instead to convey the spirit of the man, capturing everything about him through the eyes.Reese Witherspoon utilizes her adorable, plucky persona that she's cultivated for years to maximum effect as Carter, matching Phoenix's intensity and willingness to immerse herself completely in the role. Carter is the strong, moral centre on a tour filled with legendary bad boys - Cash, Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis. She resists the lures of the open road and constant touring - the drugs and alcohol - that Cash succumbs to and this is part of her attraction to him. It is her purity and loyalty - standing by him even when he hits absolute rock bottom -that is a large part of her appeal for him. Carter is just as stubborn as he is and sticks by him because she loves and believes in him. Phoenix and Witherspoon have great chemistry together as they play out their on again/off again romance. They compliment each other so well. Cash is wild and Carter is wholesome and it is these ying and yang qualities that they love about each other.There is an audio commentary by co-writer/director James Mangold. He starts things off by reading the opening page of the screenplay which is a description of the opening scene to illustrate how a script is more than just dialogue and how closely what he wrote is to what we are watching. Mangold speaks eloquently about his filmmaking process, the film's themes and Cash's life, delivering a very informative track.Also included are ten deleted scenes with optional commentary by Mangold. There is more footage of Cash's inability to be a good salesman, more of his early days as a musician in Memphis and provides a little more insight into his first wife (Goodwin), fleshing out their turbulent relationship.",5,The Man in Black Triumphant!,1141689600,"03 7, 2006",2006,3192,"['Capitalizing', 'popularity', 'Ray', 'Walk', 'Line', 'also', 'turbulent', 'career', 'life', 'iconic', 'musician', 'applying', 'same', 'plot', 'structure', 'lives', 'have', 'parallel', 'arcs', 'hit', 'same', 'dramatic', 'beats', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'struggled', 'substance', 'abuse', 'helped', 'beat', 'addiction', 'help', 'love', 'good', 'woman', 'Charles', 'who', 'wanted', 'be', 'loved', 'millions', 'Cash', 'became', 'successful', 'own', 'terms', 'turning', 'back', 'country', 'music', 'industry', 'when', 'failed', 'support', 'him.Walk', 'Line', 'fine', 'return', 'form', 'director', 'James', 'Mangold', 'who', 'started', 'career', 'independent', 'darling', 'Heavy', 'then', 'followed', 'up', 'star-studded', 'crime', 'drama', 'Cop', 'Land', 'peaked', 'critically', 'lauded', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'then', 'struggled', 'find', 'quality', 'material', 'coasting', 'entertaining', 'otherwise', 'forgettable', 'films', 'Kate', 'Leopold', 'Identity', 'Walk', 'Line', 'definitely', 'return', 'meatier', 'more', 'substantial', 'material.Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'strong', 'actor', 'who', 'been', 'search', 'right', 'role', 'finally', 'found', 'movie', 'been', 'miscast', 'strong', 'films', 'Gladiator', 'been', 'good', 'weak', 'movies', 'Ladder', '49', 'Walk', 'Line', 'perfectly', 'matched', 'considerable', 'talents', 'daunting', 'task', 'actor', 'play', 'well-known', 'public', 'figure', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'icon', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Phoenix', 'wisely', ""n't"", 'try', 'do', 'imitation', 'Cash', 'opting', 'instead', 'convey', 'spirit', 'man', 'capturing', 'everything', 'eyes.Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'adorable', 'plucky', 'persona', 'cultivated', 'years', 'maximum', 'effect', 'Carter', 'matching', 'Phoenix', 'intensity', 'willingness', 'immerse', 'completely', 'role', 'Carter', 'strong', 'moral', 'centre', 'tour', 'filled', 'legendary', 'bad', 'boys', 'Cash', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'lures', 'open', 'road', 'constant', 'touring', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'Cash', 'succumbs', 'part', 'attraction', 'purity', 'loyalty', 'standing', 'even', 'when', 'absolute', 'rock', 'bottom', '-that', 'large', 'part', 'appeal', 'Carter', 'just', 'as', 'stubborn', 'sticks', 'Phoenix', 'Witherspoon', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'together', 'play', 'out', 'again/off', 'again', 'romance', 'compliment', 'other', 'so', 'well', 'Cash', 'wild', 'Carter', 'wholesome', 'ying', 'yang', 'qualities', 'love', 'audio', 'commentary', 'co-writer/director', 'James', 'Mangold', 'things', 'off', 'reading', 'opening', 'page', 'screenplay', 'description', 'opening', 'scene', 'illustrate', 'how', 'script', 'more', 'just', 'dialogue', 'how', 'closely', 'what', 'wrote', 'what', 'are', 'watching', 'Mangold', 'eloquently', 'filmmaking', 'process', 'film', 'themes', 'Cash', 'life', 'delivering', 'very', 'informative', 'track.Also', 'included', 'are', 'ten', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'optional', 'commentary', 'Mangold', 'more', 'footage', 'Cash', 'inability', 'be', 'good', 'salesman', 'more', 'early', 'days', 'musician', 'Memphis', 'little', 'more', 'insight', 'first', 'wife', 'Goodwin', 'fleshing', 'out', 'turbulent', 'relationship']",Walk the Line

Yes, it's not supposed to be about Johnny Cash as much as it is about his stormy early relationship with his soul mate June Carter, but even insofar as it is that, Walk the Line is not even a very strong love story. Good performances are here, though, from several actors, but I was disappointed in Walk the Line, mostly because this film wasn't what it could have been or should have been or what I wanted it to be. I know it wasn't my production and others, including Johnny Cash, who gave his approval to the project before his passing, made this the story they wanted to tell, but speaking personally, I think this was both a needless assault on a cherished myth and a bit of a tall tale in itself that sacrificed fact for drama and re-wrote entire timelines. I know we live in the golden age of bringing down heroes and showing that the famous are as fallible as the rest of us, but why on earth concentrate on the aspects of the Cash's relationship that were so overly emphasized in Walk the Line?

Carter and her parents, for all practical purposes, saved Cash's life and career. Both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon (who won an Oscar for best actress for her performance) sing Cash's songs; no voice-over lip syncs here.

637355,A3CX9ZSEFCDXX4,B00005JO1R,Daniel Hurley,"[5, 5]","This is a great movie primarily due to the acting of Phoenix and Witherspoon and of course the music. Although primarily about Cash framed by the tragic consequences of his early family life, the movie centers on the love story of Cash and Carter. As Cash's music career takes off suddenly and dramatically, the lives of Carter and Cash intersect frequently to the point of doing duets together and traveling to the same shows. Captured in a time line out of synch with their own realities, their mutual affections are trapped in marriages in place long before their first meeting.  While Cash's personal life obviously languishes, Carter's also quietly self destructs over the years. In the interim, Cash's bout with pills, road schedules, guilt with his parents (a touch of daddy dearest), love for Carter and most damaging, his own family culminating in a failed marriage takes Cash to the edge of ruin.  Intermingled in this long journey are the strains of a denied love. All the music is amazing, particularly as sung by the two leads. Phoenix does not completely capture the manly roughness of Cash's voice but it is heavily masculine and pure complimenting Cash's sound. Witherspoon is surprising, particularly her singing and she plays a girlish yet strong Carter whose family is there for Cash as well, supplementing the early family support he never had.  A great film and my only critique would be to have had even more song performances.

637356,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005JO1R,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 5]","I'm always a little hesitant to watch biographical films such as Walk the Line, especially when they are based on someone I consider a personal favorite.  Johnny Cash was the man - then, now, and forever.  Heck, the one and only album my parents and I both own is Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison.  I didn't really want to learn anything that might damage my opinion of the man.  Complicating matters, you always have to wonder how much of what you are seeing is accurate and how much is the product of embellishment added to make the story more compelling.  Obviously, I already knew Johnny Cash was no angel in his younger days, but I think Walk the Line does succeed in presenting some of his mistakes and problems in a respectful, realistic way.As good as the movie is, it does have some weaknesses.  Naturally, it can't cover Johnny's whole life in detail (nor does it try to), but some aspects of the story could have used more depth and character exploration.  I remember hearing that some relatives of Johnny's first wife weren't all that thrilled with her characterization in the film.  Frankly, I found it hard to judge her at all because we never really learn much about her.  One minute, we see Johnny calling her from overseas, then the next they're married, and then Johnny finally hits it big and goes out on the road.  His wife comes across as a rather shrewish sort, and that's unfortunate because she should be a more sympathetic character in this context.  As far as Johnny and June Carter go, I would like to have seen their relationship ironed out a little bit more, as well.  From the things we see Johnny do in this film, it's difficult for me to understand why June kept coming back to him - as a singer or as a friend.  Even as their relationship grew into love, I never really saw any kind of special spark in their eyes for one another.Joaquin Phoenix does a fairly good job in the title role, but I was never able to look at him and see Johnny Cash the way I could look at Jamie Foxx in Ray and see Ray Charles.  The man in black was one-of-a-kind, especially in terms of his voice, and I think Phoenix just tried too hard at times to become the man behind the music.  He especially over-emphasizes Cash's mannerisms onstage, and that just kept disconnecting me from the film.  Casting Reese Witherspoon as June Carter ended up being the Hollywood coup of the year, as she does turn in a wonderful performance, but somebody was asleep at the wheel when some of the other cast members were selected.  Personally, I think terrible mistakes were made in the casting of actors to play Elvis, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis, and some other well-known musicians.  Orbison ended up looking like some chess club geek, while Jerry Lee Lewis looked like he should have been hanging wallpaper somewhere, far away from any stage.  It's like they cast some of these parts by pulling random names out of a hat or something.Despite the questionable casting decisions and some obvious gaps in the chronology of the film, Walk the Line does tell a compelling story about a true icon of the twentieth century.  One of the qualities that made Johnny Cash unique was his humanity.  No matter how big he got, he always seemed to be one of us, a regular guy who made mistakes just like we all do.  That's why the Folsom Prison album seems to stand at the very nexus of Cash's career - even hardened criminals felt like Johnny was one of them.

637359,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B00005JO1R,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[5, 7]","There is a moment in the new Johnny Cash Biopic WALK THE LINE that is so true and honest it stuck with me throughout the whole film. It's a moment that most people will forget, others will scoff and probably say ""look at that close-minded Bible-Thumper."" But I'll carry that moment with me for a long time. Judith Carter (Reese Witherspoon) is walking around a small five and dime. A former Southern Gospel Child star she has just gone through a horrible divorce. An old sweet women walks up to her and compliments her parents as being great Christians. After Carter thanks her for the sentiment. The old women spews the line ""Divorce is an abomination"" thus killing Judith with her down-home Christian Charm and in the process putting good ole James 3:9 into practical application ""With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God's likeness.(James 3:9 NIV)Working in Christian Radio I have come into contact with people like this. Hey I was once even accosted by a man in a collar because he didn't like the direction the station was going (and I didn't even make the decisions about that anyway.) But I also remember how easy it is to judge someone for their mistakes. It also allows me to have great admiration for June Carter and her family cause frankly this film allows them to show so much Christian love I'm embarrassed......But before this review turns into a sermon allow me to tell you just what I think I of James Mangold's WALK THE LINE.There are some people that are so complex, so multi-dimensional, that to try to sum their lives up in a few hours would be impossible. Johnny Cash is that kind of person. He was a man of faith, a man of sorrow, a man fighting his demons, and a man who had a gentle simplicity. When you saw him you thought he was easily figured out. WALK THE LINE tries and sometimes succeeds. Joaquin Phoenix stars as the Man In Black, and does a good job of becoming Cash. I didn't find myself looking at him and saying here's a guy trying to be someone he's not (earlier this week I sat through CAPOTE, and thought ""wow that's a great Phillip Seymour Hoffman playing Truman Capote, {in all honesty I was so bored by Capote I fell asleep in the middle of it so that's why there is no review}). It's a good performance because Pheonix tries his hardest to keep Cash grounded. Reese Witherspoon also controls June Carter-Cash with a live vivaciousness. She fills those shoes so well she almost steals the movie away from Pheonix and that's quite okay with me.What doesn't work is a screenplay by Gill Dennis and Director James Mangold that is so difficult to nail down. It jumps from scene to scene because that's what it feels it needs to do. So while the performances are great, the film is too busy trying to play out events, instead of getting to the heart of the matter: WHO WAS JOHNNY CASH?. It gives us scenes with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, and The Man in Black's troubles with drugs, but sometimes forgets that this is a film about a man. It's too pre-occupied with being a bio-pic and not about getting to the heart of the matter: WHO IS JOHNNY CASH? Why must bio-pics be so conservative? Why must we sit through another film about another celebrity that is too busy telling a story to care about the lead characters? (This was the problem with RAY last year. Again a film with great performances, but too preoccupied with getting the viewer from one momentous career moment to the other and not nailing done who RAY CHARLES, really was.) Johnny and June Cater Cash are people with lives far more interesting than this movie.But then there is the music. T Bone Burnett has done it again. He captured the sound of the times. He nails down Cash's music quite nicely. If there is man out there batting a thousand producing soundtracks it's Burnett. From his work on the groundbreaking ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" to ""Cold Mountian"" he makes the music a character in the film. Trying to nail down Cash's music is a monumental challenge because of its rich diversity, but Burnett seems up to the task. I just wonder why he chose to use Phoenix and Witherspoon's voice and not the CASH recordings themselves.I also liked director Mangold's attention to detail. He has captured a changing America not with the turbulent events but with background details. This is a film about Cash, and I'm glad that he captured it that way. Many films take try to hard to pull us into the time period by saying ""alright here's the sixties cut to a group of hippies protesting Vietnam."" WALK THE LINE grounds itself by not making statements about society but by showing us Cash.Then the film eventually ends with a pointless happily ever after moment that steals something from the films final analysis. It feels forced, and leaves us at a place that is too nice and peaceful. It felt like I was watching the end of Leave it to Beaver. Sheer badly paced schmaltz. I wished with film could have ended somewhere else. WALK THE LINE is a fine bio-pic, it has some brilliant acting. But it could have been so much better, CASH was larger than life and WALK THE LINE is too busy immortalizing Cash to let us know him. It's funny that, the small moment with June Cater and the old women struck me so much. It was the moment that felt honest? Who was Johnny Cash? WALK THE LINE doesn't really tell us.",3,Who Was Johnny Cash?,1132617600,"11 22, 2005",2005,5361,"['moment', 'new', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Biopic', 'WALK', 'THE', 'LINE', 'so', 'true', 'honest', 'stuck',

I forget who but one of the participants joked that it was ""Ray"" with white people.  That's a shame because it diminishes what an impressive work this is.  Though I'm not a fan of country music per se Johnny Cash always garnered my respect and kind of had street cred.  You had to admire Cash's uncompromising devotion to his work and how he carried his pain and personal demons with dignity.  The makers of ""Walk the Line"" were cognizant of the integrity of their subject matter and unlike ""Ray"" do not try to mimic the artist their portraying.  Instead they try to channel the spirit and essence of Cash and wholeheartedly succeed.  Joaquin Phoenix may not have the physical build or vocal intonations of Cash but he intuitively understood the essence of the man.  It doesn't take much doing to imagine the Man in Black playing out his own life on the screen.  Witherspoon equals Phoenix in her portrayal of the commonsensical June Carter.  Less is known about Carter than Cash but in Witherspoon's portrayal you can imagine how her guardian angel saved Cash from the abyss of substance abuse.

637362,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,B00005JO1R,David E. Levine,"[4, 6]","This movie covers the life of Johnny Cash from childhood to about the year 1968. The focus of the movie is about his relationship with June Carter who eventually becomes his wife. Johnny is in a loveless marriage as he can't even make a living, putting great stress on his first marriage. His wife doesn't think that he can make a living in music but, when he does, in fact, hit it big, there is another huge strain. He's never around since he is constantly touring. June Carter, who is recently divorced, is also part of the tour. Some of the marital stress seems to be jealousy of June.A relationship beteen Johnny and June grows slowly but his addiction to pills brings it off track. The movie then depicts Johhy's battle with his addiction and his eventual recovery and marriage to June. Joaquin Phoenix is superb as Johnny. Johnny Cash was such a unique looking individual that nobody can truly look like him but, Joaquin has his mannerisms so down pat that he actually does, in a significant way, resemble Johnny. It is a truly fine acting job. Also, his musical performaces are very good. Again, Johnny had a very distinctive voice and no one can sound just like him. However, Phoenix does a more than creditable job.Reese Witherspoon is one of my favorite actresses and her wonderful, lively, enthusiatic portrayal of June did not disappoint my expectations. In 1983, I saw Johnny and June in concert at Lake Tahoe and the onstage mannerisms of the two were captured well in the movie. (By the way, I loved seeing them live, they were great).I have a criticism that lowers my rating by a half a star (however, when I am rating by a half star, I give the benefit of the doubt and round up to the next whole star). The criticism is that the makeup crew did not do a good job of aging Johnny and June. They basically looked the same after the passage of about 13 years. Also, Johnny's father did not age from Johnny's childhood in 1944 up through the 1960s. Additionally, actors playing Elvis, Roy Orbison and Jerry Lee Lewis did not look like them. Still, the movie was riviting and well acted so I round this solid 4 and a half star effort up to five stars.",5,Convincing job by Joaquin Phoenix & Reese Witherspoon,1133654400,"12 4, 2005",2005,2164,"['movie', 'life', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'childhood', 'year', '1968', 'focus', 'movie', 'relationship', 'June', 'Carter', 'who', 'eventually', 'wife', 'Johnny', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'living', 'putting', 'great', 'stress', 'first', 'marriage', 'wife', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'make', 'living', 'music', 'when', 'fact', 'hit', 'big', 'huge', 'strain', 'never', 'around', 'constantly', 'touring', 'June', 'Carter', 'who', 'recently', 'divorced', 'also', 'part', 'tour', 'marital', 'stress', 'be', 'jealousy', 'June.A', 'relationship', 'beteen', 'Johnny', 'June', 'slowly', 'addiction', 'pills', 'off', 'track', 'movie', 'then', 'Johhy', 'battle', 'addiction', 'eventual', 'recovery', 'marriage', 'June', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'superb', 'Johnny', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'was', 'such', 'unique', 'looking', 'individual', 'nobody', 'can', 'truly', 'look', 'Joaquin', 'mannerisms', 'so', 'down', 'pat', 'actually', 'significant', 'way', 'resemble', 'Johnny', 'truly', 'fine', 'acting', 'job', 'Also', 'musical', 'performaces', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Again', 'Johnny', 'had', 'very', 'distinctive', 'voice', 'one', 'can', 'sound', 'just', 'However', 'Phoenix', 'more', 'creditable', 'job.Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'wonderful', 'lively', 'enthusiatic', 'portrayal', 'June', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'expectations', '1983', 'saw', 'Johnny', 'June', 'concert', 'Lake', 'Tahoe', 'onstage', 'mannerisms', 'two', 'were', 'captured', 'well', 'movie', 'way', 'loved', 'seeing', 'live', 'were', 'great', 'have', 'criticism', 'lowers', 'rating', 'half', 'star', 'however', 'when', 'am', 'rating', 'half', 'star', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'round', 'up', 'next', 'whole', 'star', 'criticism', 'makeup', 'crew', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'aging', 'Johnny', 'June', 'basically', 'looked', 'same', 'passage', '13', 'years', 'Also', 'Johnny', 'father', 'did', 'not', 'age', 'Johnny', 'childhood', '1944', '1960s', 'Additionally', 'actors', 'playing', 'Elvis', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'Still', 'movie', 'was', 'riviting', 'well', 'acted', 'so', 'round', 'solid', '4', 'half', 'star', 'effort', 'five', 'stars']",Walk the Line

I had no idea about his relationship with June Carter, or really any of his hit songs.  That being said, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit.  The portrait that Joaquin Phoenix paints of the classic singer is a troubled man who battled some of the usual demons that people in the spotlight often fight.  Booze, drugs, cheating on the spouse, and losing touch with the loved ones in the family, all of these plague Cash in the film.  Most of these things, like always are self imposed, and should be avoided.  It's interesting how much these things affect the famous in the world.Anyway, the performances are solid, especially Reese Witherspoon, who shines in her role as June Carter.  She spends most of her life in the limelight, working with Cash for lots of her adult life and eventually marrying him.  The film provides us information about their life together once it ends with her agreeing to marry him.  Witherspoon won the best actress Oscar for the role, well deserved.

I recommend this strongly to any Johnny Cashes fans they will not be dissapointed with the performances.  I am going to talk about the 1 disc dvd!IMAGE:Now, here's the interesting thing about the picture quality.  Despite this movie being an important and popular release, the transfer is not quite up to Fox's usual high standards.  The colors are vibrant, but they can also look oversaturated at times and maybe a tad too bright for ultimate realism; the overall delineation is good but not great; the clarity is occasionally veiled by a touch of grain; and the general appearance is sometimes rough.  Put it another way; Fox's transfers are usually much cleaner,clearer, sharper and more natural than this.  Then again, maybe its just my eyes.  The picture quality is certainly adequate.Sound:The sound is in Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1, the Dolby Digital 5.1 that I listened to being more than adequate for the occasion.  Indeed, it's excellent.  There is a very wide front-channel stero spread; terrific surround sound in the rear channels, immensely helpful in reproducing the ambient noises of live concerts; strong bass and transient response, and almost ideal clarity for midrange dialouge.  The result is an enjoyable listening experience all the way around.Special Features:On the single-disc edition that I watched, the major bous items are an audio commentary by co-writer and diretor James Mangold. On the main commentary, Mangold tells us the movie is about a man who got a second chance in life because he was blessed enough to be visited by an angel in the form of a really incredibly great woman.

There's pretty much a requirement to target the 18-35 year-old audience, and most people in that age group simply don't know enough about Johnny Cash and June Carter to appreciate their vast cultural significance and absolute authenticity.  But, since Cash was one of those rare artists who can truly be called larger than life (and death), he found admirers in that age bracket in the last decade or so of his life.  Still, that cult following isn't enough to fill movie theatre seats, so ""Walk the Line""'s creators were called upon to make some compromises while striving to evoke Cash's iconic integrity.The result is a solid, enjoyable, and moving film that follows a familiar formula in celebrity biographies: big, pivotal scenes that show the protagonist's tough road to success, with less attention to the complex interaction of the individual artist with her or his culture.Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix are, no surprise, much better looking and more glamorous, and far less earthy, than the people they are playing, but that doesn't bother me--it's Hollywood when all's said and done, and I'd rather see actors interpret their roles than to try imitating the inimitable.  Having said that, I'll stick with the general reaction and say that Witherspoon is more impressive than Phoenix because she is so much more natural and comfortable inside her character.  I respect Phoenix for doing his own playing and singing, but since I did see Johnny Cash in concert once (and hundreds of times on TV), I couldn't ever fully accept him as the Man in Black.  At the same time, I can't think of anyone who could have done better.  Playing God in a film would be easier than playing Johnny Cash!The film is well-photographed, and the production design captures the various eras well, even if the film exhibits the sort of slickness and polish that today's moviegoers demand.  There is respect for Johnny Cash, along with an honest depiction of him as a deeply flawed, difficult man.  Supporting performances are strong overall, with the actor playing Cash's grudge-holding father doing well with a pretty one-dimensional role.  Most of all, there's the music, supervised by the great T-Bone Burnett.""Walk the Line"" is a good, not great movie, but it will undoubtedly bring more believers to the shrine of the Man in Black, one of the most important musicians and songwriters of the second half of the 20th century.",3,"A Respectable, Enjoyable Approximation",1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,2523,"['makers', 'Walk', 'Line', 'obviously', 'had', 'walk', 'thin', 'shaky', 'tightrope', 'when', 'creating', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'requirement', 'target', '18-35', 'year-old', 'audience', 'most', 'people', 'age', 'group', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'enough', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'June', 'Carter', 'appreciate', 'vast', 'cultural', 'significance', 'absolute', 'authenticity', 'Cash', 'was', 'one', 'rare', 'artists', 'who', 'can', 'truly', 'be', 'called', 'larger', 'life', 'death', 'found', 'admirers', 'age', 'bracket', 'last', 'decade', 'so', 'life', 'Still', 'cult', 'following', ""n't"", 'enough', 'fill', 'movie', 'theatre', 'seats', 'Walk', 'Line', 'creators', 'were', 'called', 'upon', 'make', 'compromises', 'striving', 'evoke', 'Cash', 'iconic', 'integrity.The', 'result', 'solid', 'enjoyable', 'moving', 'film', 'familiar', 'formula', 'celebrity', 'biographies', 'big', 'pivotal', 'scenes', 'show', 'protagonist', 'tough', 'road', 'success', 'less', 'attention', 'complex', 'interaction', 'individual', 'artist', 'culture.Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'are', 'surprise', 'much', 'better', 'looking', 'more', 'glamorous', 'far', 'less', 'earthy', 'people', 'are', 'playing', ""n't"", 'bother', 'Hollywood', 'when', 'said', 'done', ""'d"", 'rather', 'see', 'actors', 'interpret', 'roles', 'try', 'imitating', 'inimitable', 'Having', 'said', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'general', 'reaction', 'say', 'Witherspoon', 'more', 'impressive', 'Phoenix', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'natural', 'comfortable', 'character', 'respect', 'Phoenix', 'doing', 'own', 'playing', 'singing', 'did', 'see', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'concert', 'once', 'hundreds', 'times', 'TV', 'could', ""n't"", 'ever', 'fully', 'accept', 'Man', 'Black', 'same', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'Playing', 'God', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'playing', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'film', 'well-photographed', 'production', 'design', 'various', 'eras', 'well', 'even', 'film', 'sort', 'slickness', 'polish', 'today', 'moviegoers', 'demand', 'respect', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'honest', 'depiction', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'difficult', 'man', 'Supporting', 'performances', 'are', 'strong', 'overall', 'actor', 'playing', 'Cash', 'grudge-holding', 'father', 'doing', 'well', 'pretty', 'one-dimensional', 'role', 'Most', 'music', 'supervised', 'great', 'T-Bone', 'Burnett', 'Walk', 'Line', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'bring', 'more', 'believers', 'shrine', 'Man', 'Black', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'musicians', 'songwriters', 'second', 'half', '20th', 'century']",Walk the Line
637375,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00005JO1R,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[15, 22]","This movie was pretty disappointing, and certainly not worthy of the rave reviews it seems to be getting... Now, I'm not one of those people who will write negative rants about movies or actors just because they are popular or win awards... I'm also not writing mean or snappy things just to show how clever I am or how catty I can be, but rather because I sincerely am baffled by the acclaim this film has gotten, and wanted to drop in a few comments that I hope will be helpful.I'm writing this review as a fellow who's been listening to country music since the early '70s, who's written about it quite a bit, played it on the radio for over a decade and thought about it a lot. Johnny Cash is clearly one of country music's great iconic figures, and the story of his courtship with June Carter is a great love story.  No problem there... The trouble lies with the flatness and predictability, the blandness and utterly cliched nature of the storytelling -- everything is telegraphed from a mile away, all the characters and their relationships are thinly drawn and unremarkable, the dialogue is flat and the music fails to overpower or excite.  In short, there's little here that can overcome the difficulties presented by trying to portray such larger than life figures as the Cashes, and while there are little glimpses when Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon look a little like the craggy, unglamorous Johnny and June, never for a moment do either of them project the true gravitas and solemnity of their roles.  Although there is some grand and purposeful cinematography, the film itself feels like it could just as easily have been an ABC after-school special from the '70s.  Seriously.  It's just a cinematically and intellectually weak, facile presentation, sadly unworthy of its subject.And then there are the little things -- for example, we see June Carter writing ""Ring Of Fire"" at some unspecified time (with co-composer Merle Kilgore nowhere in sight), but we never see the payoff, which is that the song became a collossal hit for Cash in '63.  Similarly, his move from Sun Records to Columbia -- one of the biggest decisions of his entire life -- is glossed over in a split-second image as part of a breezy visual montage.  Then there's the gratuitous insertion of would-be country rebel Shooter Jennings, playing the part of his father, Waylon Jennings, in a scene where Waylon and Johnny become roommates while down-and-out in Nashville.  It's kind of a cute in-joke, son playing the father and all that, except that Shooter doesn't look much like Waylon, and he *certainly* doesn't look like Waylon did in the mid-1960s, when the scene is supposed to take place: Jennings didn't have hippie hair and a beard back then.

The only time I got a kick out of his music was in the late Sixties (or early Seventies?), when he released his tongue-in-cheek hit, ""Boy Named Sue.""  Very entertaining, in case you haven't heard it.  Otherwise, I paid scant attention to the Man in Black, other than knowing he sang about trains, and crime, and prison, and that he was a tad rambunctious.So when WALK THE LINE initially came out, my interest wasn't all that keen on learning about the troubled life of Cash (or his equally tumultuous romance with June Carter).  Two words got me to go see the film during its theatrical run--and to watch this exceptional movie several times since:  Joaquin Phoenix.  I'm a big fan of this remarkable, versatile actor, have been ever since seeing him inGladiator.  And in Cash's biopic Phoenix doesn't disappoint:  he immerses himself in the character, becomes the troubled Man in Black--right down to the singer's deep baritone.  Equally impressive is Reese Witherspoon as the ever-aloof June Carter (ultimately June Carter Cash); Witherspoon is dead on, from June's feisty sassiness, to her twang and drawl.It's one thing not to appreciate the actual music--it's quite another to be blown away when two actors absolutely nail the actual music.  That's what makes WALK THE LINE such a great film:  it's completely, unequivocally, believable.  Further kudos go out to Robert Patrick, who plays Cash's forever-disapproving father (the Denethor of the Ozarks).  So don't let not being a fan of Johnny Cash keep you from seeing this film; if you haven't checked out WALK THE LINE, by all means do so.  And get rhythm, when you get the blues.--D.

Joaquin Phoenix, whose deep, sad eyes have added emotional depth even to comedies like ""Parenthood"" and ""To Die For"", plays Johnny Cash as a passionate, intuitive artist, a hopeless romantic and a wounded, sometimes self-destructive soul. To his first wife, he's an irresponsible dreamer who's off chasing rainbows leaving her stuck with the everyday responsibilities of raising their children. So it's no wonder he finds himself smitten by June Carter, who radiates down-to-earth charm and maternal kindness. Now that I've finally seen this film, I can totally understand why Reese Witherspoon won the Academy Award for her performance. She plays June Carter as a complicated woman; sweet and tough, humble and charismatic, passionate and moral.

The film starts with his humble beginnings, picking bales of cotton with his brother and parents in the fields and gradually depicts his path to show business, after his term in service in Germany and his job as a door-to-door salesman.  While already married and with a couple of children, he encounters the recently-divorced June Carter (brilliantly played by Reese Witherspoon), of Carter Family singing fame (of whom he has been a great fan since childhood).  They are drawn to each other, and this mutual attraction intensifies as they embark on a musical tour together, along with a very young Jerry Lee Lewis.  This also takes a gritty look at Cash's descent into speed addiction and alcoholism and June's devotion to him during this, the darkest hour of his life.We hear some of Johnny Cash's greatest songs in this film (with vocals and accompanying instruments actually performed by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon).  These songs include ""Folsom Prison Blues,"" ""It Ain't Me, Babe"" and ""Walk the Line.""  Joaquin Phoenix truly IS Johnny Cash, and you forget that he's even acting.  As for Reese Witherspoon, she earned a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actress, for her sensitive and beautiful performance as June Carter-Cash.

It was more than just one of noble ambition or grandeur of design; Johnny's virtues were just as hard-fought as his vices. In life Johnny Cash struggled for and against the God whose grip on him was so frustratingly and thankfully relentless that it was able to absorb all that fierce rage and all those addictions. Johnny could sing about murder and God in the same song and with the same voice because to do otherwise would have been dishonest. At the same time, he let that despair, agony, and rejection stand on their own-he lent them integrity. There was no serious salvation unless there was first some serious sin. Cash echoed St. Paul: ""It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."" But there is at least one thing that Cash never was, and that is a moralist. He did not chalk doubt up to a misunderstanding. Rather, Cash showed that doubt is itself proper to faith. A God who could not stomach the darkest moments of His creation was not worth our worship, much less a song.""This quote is from a fine article by [...], a theologian at Baylor University, discussing his long fight with cancer and his death at ""First Things"".""Johnny Cash died in a way that demonstrated what it might mean to die well. Unlike those who die quickly, he was graced with the company of friends and loved ones, yet he never used his illness as a pretense or a front. His end was slow, painful, marked with tremendous accomplishments (even for a healthy person), but he drew near it honestly and unsentimentally. His spirit was scarred, busted, threadbare, but fearless, peaceable, witty and wise. In his living, playing, loving, and singing, he also sounded out the timbre of the Christian faith and showed how it ought to be lived: stammeringly, tunefully, with no overdubs and no effects. But most of all, with soul.""Songwriter Rodney Crowell had this to say about his former father-in-law's passing. ""Johnny Cash will, like Will Rogers, stand forever as a symbol of intelligence, creativity, compassion and common sense.""They don't make them like Johnny any more.

637388,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00005JO1R,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","Johnny Cash was one of those awesome, almost legendary figures that needs no introduction. He was Johnny Cash, the Man in Black. Nuff said.And you would think that no actor could adequately capture his mystique, but the ever-brilliant Joaquin Phoenix came pretty close in ""Walk The Line."" The story of the first half of Cash's life runs through a lot of the typical tropes -- drugs, sex, hitting rock bottom, finding love -- but Phoenix's eerily perfect performance elevates it. And yes, he sings.The story begins in Cash's boyhood, which was marked by A) the open contempt of his alcoholic father, B) the shocking death of his brother, and C) his love of music. When he was grown, Cash (Phoenix) joined the Air Force and married his reluctant girlfriend Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin).But his love of music never died. Despite Vivian wanting him to get a ""real job,"" Cash successfully impressed a record executive with his gravelly voice and gritty songs -- and became a megastar with his very first album. While on tour, he encountered June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), and was immediately smitten by her both professionally and personally.But his growing love for June quickly destroyed his marriage, and his increasing drug use seemed to be doing the same to his career -- even landing him in jail at one point. June stepped in to save him from his downward spiral, inspiring him to clean up his life and go back on the road -- even to Folsom Prison, where he had a lot of fans. But his true goal was her hand in marriage.""Walk the Line"" has a rather rough task -- tell the life story of one of America's most beloved singers, warts and all, without diminishing any of what made him great. So yeah, there's adultery and drug use here, but it never blots out the wounded, romantic soul that walks the line in the center of it, tangled in barbed-wire issues.And the triumph of the film is Joaquin Phoenix, who gives a scarily perfect performance as Cash. His body language, his expressions, even his VOICE are all altered to be as close as possible to Cash's -- and yes, Phoenix sings Cash's songs. But what makes his performance great is not mere mimicry of Cash -- it's his ability to give a pitch-perfect imitation of Cash while also giving a powerful, heartfelt performance as an artistic soul covered in scars, who had to fight his way past everyone who doubted him.James Mangold focuses a lot on the shaping influences of Cash's life here, setting up his brother's horrific, bloody death as the place where his life changed. But when June enters the story, it becomes less about Cash by himself, and more about the love story between them -- lots of significant glances on brightly-lit stages, lots of impassioned pleas on tour buses.Sadly, Reese Witherspoon can't stand up to Phoenix's spellbinding performance. She isn't bad, but her ""perky li'l Southern belle"" performance just feels immature and shallow when she's standing next to him. It's hard to see what depths Cash saw in this woman.""Walk the Like"" is a movie entirely revolving around the breathtaking performance of Joaquin Phoenix, who practically BECOMES Johnny Cash as few other actors ever could. Witherspoon just can't stand up to it.",4,I fell into a burning ring of fire,1366243200,"04 18, 2013",2013,3203,"['Johnny', 'Cash', 'was', 'one', 'awesome', 'almost', 'legendary', 'figures', 'introduction', 'was', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Man', 'Black', 'Nuff', 'said.And', 'would', 'think', 'actor', 'could', 'adequately', 'capture', 'mystique', 'ever-brilliant', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'came', 'pretty', 'close', 'Walk', 'Line', 'story', 'first', 'half', 'Cash', 'life', 'lot', 'typical', 'tropes', 'drugs', 'sex', 'hitting', 'rock', 'bottom', 'finding', 'love', 'Phoenix', 'eerily', 'perfect', 'performance', 'yes', 'sings.The', 'story', 'begins', 'Cash', 'boyhood', 'was', 'marked', 'A', 'open', 'contempt', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'B', 'shocking', 'death', 'brother', 'C', 'love', 'music', 'When', 'was', 'grown', 'Cash', 'Phoenix', 'joined', 'Air', 'Force', 'married', 'reluctant', 'girlfriend', 'Vivian', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', '.But', 'love', 'music', 'never', 'died', 'Vivian', 'wanting', 'get', 'real', 'job', 'Cash', 'successfully', 'impressed', 'record', 'executive', 'gravelly', 'voice', 'gritty', 'songs', 'became', 'megastar', 'very', 'first', 'album', 'tour', 'encountered', 'June', 'Carter', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'was', 'immediately', 'smitten', 'professionally', 'personally.But', 'growing', 'love', 'June', 'quickly', 'destroyed', 'marriage', 'increasing', 'drug', 'use', 'seemed', 'be', 'doing', 'same', 'career', 'even', 'landing', 'jail', 'one', 'point', 'June', 'stepped', 'save', 'downward', 'spiral', 'inspiring', 'clean', 'up', 'life', 'go', 'back', 'road', 'even', 'Folsom', 'Prison', 'where', 'had', 'lot', 'fans', 'true', 'goal', 'was', 'hand', 'marriage', 'Walk', 'Line', 'rather', 'rough', 'task', 'tell', 'life', 'story', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'beloved', 'singers', 'warts', 'diminishing', 'what', 'made', 'great', 'So', 'yeah', 'adultery', 'drug', 'use', 'here', 'never', 'out', 'wounded', 'romantic', 'soul', 'line', 'center', 'tangled', 'barbed-wire', 'issues.And', 'triumph', 'film', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'who', 'scarily', 'perfect', 'performance', 'Cash', 'body', 'language', 'expressions', 'even', 'VOICE', 'are', 'altered', 'be', 'as', 'close', 'possible', 'Cash', 'yes', 'Phoenix', 'Cash', 'songs', 'what', 'performance', 'great', 'not', 'mere', 'mimicry', 'Cash', 'ability', 'give', 'pitch-perfect', 'imitation', 'Cash', 'also', 'giving', 'powerful', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'artistic', 'soul', 'covered', 'scars', 'who', 'had', 'fight', 'way', 'everyone', 'who', 'doubted', 'him.James', 'Mangold', 'lot', 'shaping', 'influences', 'Cash', 'life', 'here', 'setting', 'up', 'brother', 'horrific', 'bloody', 'death', 'place', 'where', 'life', 'changed', 'when', 'June', 'story', 'less', 'Cash', 'more', 'love', 'story', 'lots', 'significant', 'glances', 'brightly-lit', 'stages', 'lots', 'impassioned', 'pleas', 'tour', 'buses.Sadly', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'Phoenix', 'spellbinding', 'performance', ""n't"", 'bad', 'perky', 'li', 'l', 'Southern', 'belle', 'performance', 'just', 'feels', 'immature', 'shallow', 'when', 'standing', 'next', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'depths', 'Cash', 'saw', 'woman', 'Walk', 'movie', 'entirely', 'revolving', 'breathtaking', 'performance', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'who', 'practically', 'BECOMES', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'few', 'other', 'actors', 'ever', 'could', 'Witherspoon', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up']",Walk the Line
637389,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JO1R,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","What is most intriguing about the new Johnny Cash biopic is how Joaquin Phoenix does more of an impressionistic take on the Man in Black rather than the dead-on impersonation that Jaime Foxx did as Ray Charles, or going further back, that Gary Busey did as Buddy Holly. Although Phoenix lacks Cash's craggy features and full-throated delivery, there is enough resemblance vocally and physically for him to get away with it. Moreover, what Phoenix does very well is get under the skin of Cash's psyche through sheer intensity in director James Mangold's 2005 film. When he performs onstage, it is not so much the musicality that gets you but the often scary glare he gives as a tortured soul. Whether destroying a dressing room or feeling ill-at-ease with his stoic parents, it's a powerfully unrelenting performance that evokes Cash's spirit, albeit one that is sometimes too off-putting and humorless over the course of a 136-minute film.Recent biopics seem to be following similar dramatic patterns. Especially in the early going, the movie bears a striking resemblance to ""Ray"" in treatment - a rural childhood, a demanding parent, a transformative childhood trauma, adultery, drug addiction. However, to Mangold's and co-writer Gill Dennis's credit, he does not go back and forth to Cash's childhood to make us understand his pain. Instead, he deals with it succinctly upfront and uses the periodic reappearance of his parents as the emotional link. The other aspect that works in the film's favor is the love story at the core. Cash's incessant, decade-long yearning for June Carter provides the spark of the film.Reese Witherspoon takes advantage of portraying a real-life character less recognizable than Cash and inhabits June with an obviously deep empathy and an authentically Southern-fried sensibility. What remains consistent from her most recent films, for instance, her anachronistic Becky Sharp in ""Vanity Fair"" or her overachieving half-spirit in ""Just Like Heaven"",  are the fierce intelligence and iron will that seem to be her growing trademarks. She also easily brings out June's natural kinship with performing (not only singing but comedy bits and playing the autoharp), and her duets with Phoenix onstage, especially ""Jackson"", are among the movie's best moments. Casting a fishing reel with aplomb or facing her Christian guilt over the first divorce, she brings a natural goodwill that's completely convincing. As the love story moves toward resolution with a family intervention and a romantic onstage moment, it's really Witherspoon's no-nonsense nurturing that attracts our attention more than Phoenix's doleful responses.It's always a risky decision to go with the singing voices of the real-life performers or the actors portraying them. Some voices are so recognizable as to defy impersonation (e.g., using Ray Charles' original tracks in ""Ray""). Neither Phoenix nor Witherspoon sang or performed musical instruments before being cast, but they bring such a great sense of showmanship that their vocal deficiencies simply don't matter.  Credit needs to go to T. Bone Burnett for training them so well for six months. There are also terrific scenes with Cash interacting other legendary figures like Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis, the latter played with fiery mischief by Waylon Malloy Payne.The movie has a solid supporting cast even if some of the roles falter toward stereotype, for instance, Robert Patrick simmering near a boil as Cash's cold father, country singer Shelby Lynne looking and acting dour as his psalm-singing mother, and especially Ginnifer Goodwin, who has to play Cash's first wife Vivian as a small-minded shrew. Like all-fact-based movies, the movie can also feel episodic, and it does sag somewhat in the middle as the film belabors Cash's amphetamine addiction. Regardless, even if you are not a fan of Cash or the Carter family, this is still fine Hollywood filmmaking with two actors going at their roles with real brio and Witherspoon, in particular, getting to the real heart of the story with conviction.",4,Superb Witherspoon Complements an Evocative Phoenix in Real-Life Love Story,1132358400,"11 19, 2005",2005,4062,"['What', 'most', 'intriguing', 'new', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'biopic', 'how', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'more', 'impressionistic', 'take', 'Man', 'Black', 'rather', 'dead-on', 'impersonation', 'Jaime', 'Foxx', 'did', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'going', 'further', 'back', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'did', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'Phoenix', 'Cash', 'craggy', 'features', 'full-throated', 'delivery', 'enough', 'resemblance', 'vocally', 'physically', 'get', 'away', 'Moreover', 'what', 'Phoenix', 'very', 'well', 'get', 'skin', 'Cash', 'psyche', 'sheer', 'intensity', 'director', 'James', 'Mangold', '2005', 'film', 'When', 'onstage', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'musicality', 'often', 'scary', 'glare', 'tortured', 'soul', 'Whether', 'destroying', 'dressing', 'room', 'feeling', 'ill-at-ease', 'stoic', 'parents', 'powerfully', 'unrelenting', 'performance', 'Cash', 'spirit', 'one', 'sometimes', 'too', 'off-putting', 'humorless', 'course', '136-minute', 'film.Recent', 'biopics', 'seem', 'be', 'following', 'similar', 'dramatic', 'patterns', 'Especially', 'early', 'going', 'movie', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'Ray', 'treatment', 'rural', 'childhood', 'demanding', 'parent', 'transformative', 'childhood', 'trauma', 'adultery', 'drug', 'addiction', 'However', 'Mangold', 'co-writer', 'Gill', 'Dennis', 'credit', 'not', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'Cash', 'childhood', 'make', 'understand', 'pain', 'Instead', 'succinctly', 'upfront', 'periodic', 'reappearance', 'parents', 'emotional', 'link', 'other', 'aspect', 'film', 'favor', 'love', 'story', 'core', 'Cash', 'incessant', 'decade-long', 'yearning', 'June', 'Carter', 'spark', 'film.Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'advantage', 'portraying', 'real-life', 'character', 'less', 'recognizable', 'Cash', 'inhabits', 'June', 'obviously', 'deep', 'empathy', 'authentically', 'Southern-fried', 'sensibility', 'What', 'consistent', 'most', 'recent', 'films', 'instance', 'anachronistic', 'Becky', 'Sharp', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'overachieving', 'half-spirit', 'Just', 'Heaven', 'are', 'fierce', 'intelligence', 'iron', 'will', 'seem', 'be', 'growing', 'trademarks', 'also', 'easily', 'out', 'June', 'natural', 'kinship', 'performing', 'not', 'only', 'singing', 'comedy', 'bits', 'playing', 'autoharp', 'duets', 'Phoenix', 'onstage', 'especially', 'Jackson', 'are', 'movie', 'best', 'moments', 'Casting', 'fishing', 'reel', 'aplomb', 'facing', 'Christian', 'guilt', 'first', 'divorce', 'natural', 'goodwill', 'completely', 'convincing', 'love', 'story', 'moves', 'resolution', 'family', 'intervention', 'romantic', 'onstage', 'moment', 'really', 'Witherspoon', 'no-nonsense', 'nurturing', 'attention', 'more', 'Phoenix', 'doleful', 'responses.It', 'always', 'risky', 'decision', 'go', 'singing', 'voices', 'real-life', 'performers', 'actors', 'portraying', 'voices', 'are', 'so', 'recognizable', 'defy', 'impersonation', 'e.g.', 'using', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'original', 'tracks', 'Ray', 'Phoenix', 'Witherspoon', 'sang', 'performed', 'musical', 'instruments', 'being', 'cast', 'bring', 'great', 'sense', 'showmanship', 'vocal', 'deficiencies', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Credit', 'go', 'T.', 'Bone', 'Burnett', 'training', 'so', 'well', 'six', 'months', 'are', 'also', 'terrific', 'scenes', 'Cash', 'interacting', 'other', 'legendary', 'figures', 'Elvis', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'latter', 'played', 'fiery', 'mischief', 'Waylon', 'Malloy', 'Payne.The', 'movie', 'solid', 'supporting', 'cast', 'even', 'roles', 'falter', 'stereotype', 'instance', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'simmering', 'boil', 'Cash', 'cold', 'father', 'country', 'singer', 'Shelby', 'Lynne', 'looking', 'acting', 'dour', 'psalm-singing', 'mother', 'especially', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'who', 'play', 'Cash', 'first', 'wife', 'Vivian', 'small-minded', 'shrew', 'all-fact-based', 'movies', 'movie', 'can', 'also', 'feel', 'episodic', 'sag', 'somewhat', 'middle', 'film', 'belabors', 'Cash', 'amphetamine', 'addiction', 'Regardless', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'Cash', 'Carter', 'family', 'still', 'fine', 'Hollywood', 'filmmaking', 'two', 'actors', 'going', 'roles', 'real', 'brio', 'Witherspoon', 'particular', 'getting', 'real', 'heart', 'story', 'conviction']",Walk the Line

637394,A1655SGPPUUCRP,B00005JO1R,Emily Todd,"[2, 4]","In general, biographical films tend to be troublesome: how do you do justice to ANYONE's life in 120 minutes?  Much less a musical legend with a life full of such intrigue and drama that it could fill several years worth of the National Enquirer, front to back?First of all I must admit that I am not generally a fan of many things that are front and center in this film, those being country music, musicals, Jonny Cash, and heavily biographical films in which we're shown the rich artist as a poor, lil child, only to turn into a major singer later in life, complete with tough breaks in love and all sorts of drug and alcohol problems. That said, if you're looking at this film on paper, that's pretty much what you get, but if you actually watch the movie, you'll get a lot more out of it, mainly due to the film's two lead actors, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, both of whom take over their real-life counterparts' personas entirely, and deliver two of the most resonant performances of the year.I found myself utterly swept away with this gritty yet utterly enchanting story of Jonny Cash and the story of the great love that grew between country stars Cash and June Carter during the early years of Cash's career. ""Walk the Line"" is the result of intense collaboration between director James Mangold, co-writer Gill Dennis, Johnny Cash, and June Carter Cash. Though both Cashes died in 2003, they oversaw the script's development for seven years. Mangold and Cash's insistence that the film's stars would actually sing paid off. Witherspoon's singing (as June) is lovely, and Phoenix's contains the raw energy and soul that defined Cash's sound. Even as a child on a cotton farm in Depression-era Arkansas, Cash shows a strong interest in music, escaping from his no-frills life and strict father (Robert Patrick) through hymns and listening to the radio. When his brother dies in a freak accident, young Johnny feels responsible, and worries that he will never live up to his brother's goodness.The film follows Cash through his first marriage with Vivian Cash (Ginnifer Goodwin) and into the early stages of his touring career alongside such musicians as Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, and most importantly, June Carter. As Cash's success grows, so does his relationship with drugs, alcohol, and Carter, putting a strain upon his family life. From his initial audition with Sam Phillips of Sun Records on through his legendary 1968 concert at Folsom Prison, Cash is transformed from a hesitant singer riddled with demons to a man whose uniquely bold style would make music history.At the film's opening, Cash (Phoenix) sits alone in a side room fingering a saw blade, then flashes back to his childhood on a cotton farm. His overbearing father (Robert Patrick) blames him for his older brother's accidental death, which may or may not have been prevented had Cash been working with him instead of fishing. The severity of Ray Cash's ""it should have been you, J.R."" mentality will stay with Johnny Cash always, creeping into his songs and his medicine cabinet.The story is simple enough, and at times conventional. Cash's relationship with his first wife, Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), is relegated to the standard ""we can't make rent,"" and, ""I'm jealous of those screaming girls on the tour"" kind of strife, which no doubt happened, but wasn't there something deeper?Nonetheless, Mangold creates savory moments that not only subvert convention, but yield new insight. Cash's first session with Sam Phillips at Sun Records (a bit part played like a big one by Dallas Roberts) - when Phillips preaches to Cash and his dopey-eyed backup gospel singers about the kind of songs that really save people (the kind that sell records) - is one of the more sheerly fun scenes in film this year; second, perhaps, to the theology lesson delivered by Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne).These moments - what it's like in the car with Cash, Lewis and gang - are the sort of things easily left out of a biography, and they are the kind of details without which a biography seems devoid of the life it's trying to explain. Witherspoon becomes the unlikely anchor of this film - the peg around which all of its honesty is tethered. We see it in the way she responds to a store clerk lecturing Carter on the moral implications of divorce, and in the way she instantly recovers, on the surface, because she has to buoy Cash.""Walk the Line"" never attempts to paint a full picture of Cash's prolific career, but instead focuses on the passions that drove his music and on the woman who gave him strength. With magical performances by Witherspoon and Phoenix, a haunting and inspiring American romance is brought beautifully to life. All together now, ""Aaaaaaaaaaaaaw, now wasn't that the cutest little love story?""""Walk the Line"" leaves approximately 35 years of Cash's life untouched, and has gaps in much of the time it does cover. This is a good thing. Many films about legendary figures forget that legends make their own records.

Themovie could almost be called ""Ray II"" b/c it follows a similiarstructure, storyline, and visual style as the Ray Charles flick. The screen writers made the interesting choice of telling Cash's story up to 1968, which overall worked, but does make the movie plod a bit with its 135 minute length (thank god they deleted a ton of scenes at that).  The performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon are as captivating as the music, and overall their love story has intrigue, although it too is a bit drawn out.  Overall, I felt too much time in the heart of the movie was allocated to Cash's drug problem, which heightened the negative feel of the story. Although I realize biographical movies can spread themselves too thin by covering too many aspects/phases of the person's life, I feel this one could'vebeen a bit more dynamic in the approach.  Overall, the storyline was too focused on his failed marriage, pillhabit, and love for June.  I felt I didn't learn or experience as much as I could have.

Joaquin Phoenix takes on a tough role as Cash, and does commendable in creating the rebellious man who has high hopes of making it big despite family tragedy and hardships. While the die-hard Cash fans might not be as accepting to call this movie an instant and solid success, I, a new fan of Cash, found the film remarkable and very deserving of the accolades it received in being nominated last year ( I thought this film was far superior to eventual winner ""Crash"").The most remarkable and entertaining aspect of this movie was the performance given by Joaquin Phoenix (Johnny Cash) and Reese Witherspoon (June Carter), as one reviewer noted. Joaquin Phoenix's ability to make a role like this work, and sing Cash's songs with some success, is what really gives this role much credibility and dignity. Reese Witherspoon's role as June Carter relies on much of what she has had to do before, which is create comedy and be perky. However, Witherspoon successfully makes this role complex and deep, not just one-dimensional, and her ability to portray some of the difficulties that June Carter had in her own life while becoming acquainted with Cash makes this portrayal a success. Phoenix and Carter work well together, and they do an excellent job singing some of the songs by Cash and Carter, as well as performing duets they did together (one of my favorites was ""Jackson"").The film also covers briefly some of the aspects of Cash's family life, as well as his interest in music. Although this part of the film is perhaps too short (what can you do in only two hours), we understand the heavy guilt that plays a role in Johnny's life for the loss of his brother during his younger years. We also see the riff between him and his father, with Johnny seemingly feeling like the ""other"" son much of the time, and being unable to please him. Johnny derives interest in gospel music, but, when he is told that that won't sell, he pulls out a song he when inspiration hit, ""Folsom City Blues"" (Cash will later play in Folsom County Jail after he gets tons of fan mail after writing that song).If there is one negative, it is that perhaps there is too much time spent on Cash's drug addiction. Maybe more of this could have been spent focusing on some of his younger years or the later years.However, overall, this film is entertaining, vibrant, and worth the two hours spent watching it.",5,Commendable job by Witherspoon and Phoenix!,1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,2594,"['Walk', 'Line', 'representative', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'life', 'depicting', 'rise', 'stardom', 'consequences', 'as', 'well', 'brief', 'points', 'childhood', 'later', 'drug', 'addiction', 'martial', 'problems', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'tough', 'role', 'Cash', 'commendable', 'creating', 'rebellious', 'man', 'who', 'high', 'hopes', 'making', 'big', 'family', 'tragedy', 'hardships', 'die-hard', 'Cash', 'fans', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'accepting', 'call', 'movie', 'instant', 'solid', 'success', 'new', 'fan', 'Cash', 'found', 'film', 'remarkable', 'very', 'deserving', 'accolades', 'received', 'being', 'nominated', 'last', 'year', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'far', 'superior', 'eventual', 'winner', 'Crash', 'most', 'remarkable', 'entertaining', 'aspect', 'movie', 'was', 'performance', 'given', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'June', 'Carter', 'one', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'ability', 'make', 'role', 'work', 'sing', 'Cash', 'songs', 'success', 'what', 'really', 'role', 'much', 'credibility', 'dignity', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'role', 'June', 'Carter', 'much', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'create', 'comedy', 'be', 'perky', 'However', 'Witherspoon', 'successfully', 'role', 'complex', 'deep', 'not', 'just', 'one-dimensional', 'ability', 'portray', 'difficulties', 'June', 'Carter', 'had', 'own', 'life', 'becoming', 'acquainted', 'Cash', 'portrayal', 'success', 'Phoenix', 'Carter', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'singing', 'songs', 'Cash', 'Carter', 'as', 'well', 'performing', 'duets', 'did', 'together', 'one', 'favorites', 'was', 'Jackson', '.The', 'film', 'also', 'briefly', 'aspects', 'Cash', 'family', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'interest', 'music', 'part', 'film', 'perhaps', 'too', 'short', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'only', 'two', 'hours', 'understand', 'heavy', 'guilt', 'role', 'Johnny', 'life', 'loss', 'brother', 'younger', 'years', 'also', 'see', 'riff', 'father', 'Johnny', 'seemingly', 'feeling', 'other', 'son', 'much', 'time', 'being', 'unable', 'please', 'Johnny', 'interest', 'gospel', 'music', 'when', 'told', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sell', 'out', 'song', 'when', 'inspiration', 'hit', 'Folsom', 'City', 'Blues', 'Cash', 'will', 'later', 'play', 'Folsom', 'County', 'Jail', 'tons', 'fan', 'mail', 'writing', 'song', '.If', 'one', 'negative', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'Cash', 'drug', 'addiction', 'Maybe', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'focusing', 'younger', 'years', 'later', 'years.However', 'overall', 'film', 'entertaining', 'vibrant', 'two', 'hours', 'spent', 'watching']",Walk the Line

It's difficult to explain to those who haven't seen it, but those who have, I'm sure you'll agree with me what an utterly stunning opening it was, with that infectious country beat contrasted with the confides of the prison. It was riveting, and immediately I knew this was going to be a wonderful film.Jaoquin Phoenix was captivating as Cash, and I was impressed with the depth of similarities between him and his character. We all know of River Phoenix, Jaoquin's late brother who suddenly died of drug overdose in the early 90s. Then ofcourse was Joaquin's own battle with substance and drug abuse. Whether he meant these details to impact or not, Joaquin's performance is so honest and raw, one MUST draw the parallels. But alone the performance is inspired and he well deserved the Golden Globe.Reese Witherspoon is as you've never seen her (ie Brunette!) as June Carter, and she's marvellous. I could really relate and connect with her character. As mentioned earlier, the on-screen chemistry between Phoenix and Witherspoon was so strong and poignant. I could really sense the connection.Last but certainly not least is the music, which acts as the third character in this bio-epic. Phoenix and Witherspoon as you know put their own singing skills to the test here, and the result is amazing! I will be the first to admit country music is CERTAINLY not my thing, but even I found Cash's melodies and the actors' impression of them captivating. My views on country music were definately changed after this film. So if you are, like me, not a fan of country music, this film will certainly be an exception to that.""Walk the Line"" exceeded all my expectations and was a truly insightful, inspiring and moving love story. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon light up the silver screen and put in the finest performances so far in their careers. It's a film about self acceptance and companionship, that will certainly move you and make you think twice about country music. From it's thrilling beginning to it's heartwarming end, ""Walk the Line"" is a wonderful film!",5,A beautifully-crafted film about the human spirit,1140220800,"02 18, 2006",2006,3010,"['Hello', ""'m"", 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Steller', 'performances', 'gripping', 'adapted', 'soundtrack', 'make', 'Walk', 'Line', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'personally', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time.Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'display', 'radiant', 'chemistry', 'starring', 'together', 'legendary', 'country', 'music', 'icons', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'June', 'Carter', 'story', 'life', 'mind', 'musically-driven', 'Cash', 'who', 'swarmed', 'spotlight', 'sharp', 'razor', 'sound', 'torments', 'childhood', 'loss', 'brother', 'breaking', 'marriage', 'as', 'well', 'misunderstandings', 'father', 'rapidly', 'lead', 'heavy', 'addiction', 'drugs', 'June', 'Carter', 'played', 'magnificent', 'Witherspoon', 'mentor', 'inspiration', 'Cash', 'as', 'well', 'soul', 'mate', 'whom', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'are', 'several', 'aspects', 'film', 'want', 'mention', ""'ll"", 'start', 'opening', 'credits', 'Wow', 'very', 'first', 'moment', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'completely', 'taken', 'aback', 'difficult', 'explain', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'who', 'have', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'what', 'utterly', 'stunning', 'opening', 'was', 'infectious', 'country', 'beat', 'contrasted', 'confides', 'prison', 'was', 'riveting', 'immediately', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'wonderful', 'film.Jaoquin', 'Phoenix', 'was', 'captivating', 'Cash', 'was', 'impressed', 'depth', 'similarities', 'character', 'know', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'Jaoquin', 'late', 'brother', 'who', 'suddenly', 'died', 'drug', 'overdose', 'early', '90s', 'Then', 'ofcourse', 'was', 'Joaquin', 'own', 'battle', 'substance', 'drug', 'abuse', 'details', 'impact', 'not', 'Joaquin', 'performance', 'so', 'honest', 'raw', 'MUST', 'draw', 'parallels', 'alone', 'performance', 'inspired', 'well', 'deserved', 'Golden', 'Globe.Reese', 'Witherspoon', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'ie', 'Brunette', 'June', 'Carter', 'marvellous', 'could', 'really', 'relate', 'connect', 'character', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'Phoenix', 'Witherspoon', 'was', 'so', 'strong', 'poignant', 'could', 'really', 'sense', 'connection.Last', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', 'music', 'third', 'character', 'bio-epic', 'Phoenix', 'Witherspoon', 'know', 'put', 'own', 'singing', 'skills', 'test', 'here', 'result', 'amazing', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'country', 'music', 'CERTAINLY', 'not', 'thing', 'even', 'found', 'Cash', 'melodies', 'actors', 'impression', 'captivating', 'views', 'country', 'music', 'were', 'definately', 'changed', 'film', 'So', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'country', 'music', 'film', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'exception', 'Walk', 'Line', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'was', 'truly', 'insightful', 'inspiring', 'moving', 'love', 'story', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'light', 'up', 'silver', 'screen', 'put', 'finest', 'performances', 'so', 'far', 'careers', 'film', 'self', 'acceptance', 'companionship', 'will', 'certainly', 'move', 'make', 'think', 'twice', 'country', 'music', 'thrilling', 'beginning', 'heartwarming', 'end', 'Walk', 'Line', 'wonderful', 'film']",Walk the Line

Johnny then walks away, suggesting his pappy tell his granddaughters a story.the father, looking utterly perplexed, says he doesn't know any stories.  Johnny shoots back:  why don't you tell 'em about the time you built a boat and saved your family from a flood?  (the incident inspired the Cash tune ""Five Feet High and Rising"".)this scene revealed the source of what had up until then been the father's lifelong resentment of the son.  every boy in America knows the string has to be pulled taught to carry sound between two cups.  the only conclusion to be drawn from the father's ignorance of this simple fact of childhood is that he had been too poor to have had a childhood.  growing up in the Mississippi Delta, the father probably started working in the cotton fields around age 5 (the same age as his son Johnny later would).but, by contrast with his father, Johnny had never wanted to do anything but play.  he was fishing instead of helping his brother when the older boy (their father's favorite) was killed in an accident cutting wood at the saw mill.  as an adult Johnny hadn't worked at a regular job -- he played the guitar instead.  when he wasn't playing the guitar, he was playing around with alcohol, drugs, and women he wasn't married to.being of Scottish descent, the father was the sort of man who'd have preferred having boiling oil poured into his ear, rather than ever brag about himself.  whereas Johnny's career was about self-promotion, to the point of wanting fans to think of him as some kind of career outlaw, which disgusted the father.so, even though the father was the kind of man who, like Noah, had saved his family by building a boat with the flood waters rising, when asked he couldn't think of any story to tell -- just the opposite of Johnny.an incredibly rich, yet economical, scene.",5,best movie scene ever?,1191110400,"09 30, 2007",2007,2448,"['Walk', 'Line', 'one', 'finest', 'scenes', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'end', 'see', 'Johnny', 'hosting', 'family', 'gathering', 'now', 'been', 'off', 'substances', 'awhile', 'been', 'behaving', 'responsible', 'husband', 'father', 'Cash', 'pappy', 'are', 'finally', 'reconciled.Cash', 'two', 'young', 'daughters', 'are', 'trying', 'talk', 'grandfather', 'styrofoam', 'cups', 'attached', 'string', 'grandfather', 'can', 'hear', 'anything', 'cups', 'string', 'hanging', 'loose.Johnny', 'explains', 'pappy', 'string', 'be', 'pulled', 'taut', 'conduct', 'sound', 'cups', 'Johnny', 'then', 'away', 'suggesting', 'pappy', 'tell', 'granddaughters', 'story.the', 'father', 'looking', 'utterly', 'perplexed', ""n't"", 'know', 'stories', 'Johnny', 'shoots', 'back', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'time', 'built', 'boat', 'saved', 'family', 'flood', 'incident', 'inspired', 'Cash', 'tune', 'Five', 'Feet', 'High', 'Rising', 'scene', 'revealed', 'source', 'what', 'had', 'up', 'then', 'been', 'father', 'lifelong', 'resentment', 'son', 'boy', 'America', 'string', 'be', 'pulled', 'taught', 'carry', 'sound', 'two', 'cups', 'only', 'conclusion', 'be', 'drawn', 'father', 'ignorance', 'simple', 'fact', 'childhood', 'had', 'been', 'too', 'poor', 'have', 'had', 'childhood', 'growing', 'up', 'Mississippi', 'Delta', 'father', 'probably', 'started', 'working', 'cotton', 'fields', 'age', '5', 'same', 'age', 'son', 'Johnny', 'later', 'would', '.but', 'contrast', 'father', 'Johnny', 'had', 'never', 'wanted', 'do', 'anything', 'play', 'was', 'fishing', 'instead', 'helping', 'brother', 'when', 'older', 'boy', 'father', 'favorite', 'was', 'killed', 'accident', 'cutting', 'wood', 'saw', 'mill', 'adult', 'Johnny', 'had', ""n't"", 'worked', 'regular', 'job', 'played', 'guitar', 'instead', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'playing', 'guitar', 'was', 'playing', 'around', 'alcohol', 'drugs', 'women', 'was', ""n't"", 'married', 'to.being', 'Scottish', 'descent', 'father', 'was', 'sort', 'man', 'who', ""'d"", 'have', 'preferred', 'having', 'boiling', 'oil', 'poured', 'ear', 'rather', 'ever', 'brag', 'Johnny', 'career', 'was', 'self-promotion', 'point', 'wanting', 'fans', 'think', 'kind', 'career', 'outlaw', 'disgusted', 'father.so', 'even', 'father', 'was', 'kind', 'man', 'who', 'Noah', 'had', 'saved', 'family', 'building', 'boat', 'flood', 'waters', 'rising', 'when', 'asked', 'could', ""n't"", 'think', 'story', 'tell', 'just', 'opposite', 'Johnny.an', 'incredibly', 'rich', 'yet', 'economical', 'scene']",Walk the Line

""Walk the Line"" was an acclaimed movie, the story of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. I particularly remembered Johnny Cash from his rise in the earliest days of what later became Rock 'n' Roll. He, along with Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley and several others were the star recording artists on the legendary Sun Records roster under the direction of Sam Phillips. This DVD will automatically become an important part of my music collection.It's an excellent movie! I can't emphasize this enough. Joaquin Phoenix and  Reese Witherspoon were outstanding in their depictions of Johnny and June, and they did their own singing! The music was quite good, perhaps not quite up to the original masters, but it was close. All of the other musical performers were outstanding. The movie was a period piece, of course, and the depiction of the 50s and 60s was very well done. I particularly liked the 50s. Everything looked absolutely authentic. The streets were lined with magnificently restored 50s and earlier cars, some of which I haven't seen for decades. Where did they get them all?The story was captivating. It recorded Johnny Cash's spectacular rise from being a failing door-to-door salesman, to a recording artist and up to a super-star in a very short period of time. Naturally, there's booze, drugs and women, not necessarily in that order, and there's the fall. It's a common story for rock 'n' rollers, but it's exceptionally well done here. And the story really got a good grip on the heart. This movie was magnificently entertaining, and if you liked the music, it's just heavenly. Five Stars!Gary Peterson",5,Magnificently Entertaining.

637411,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B00005JO1R,General Breadbasket,"[0, 0]","""Walk the Line"" is a film that covers the early career of Johnny Cash and his early romances, plus his encounters with rock n' rollers such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley while on tour. My Mum saw it at least 3 times in the cinema, and then went a whole bunch of Johnny's albums afterwards. When it came out on DVD, I had to pick it up, see what all the fuss was about. It's really well done, I thought, in pretty much every way.Joaquin Phoenix plays Johnny, and Reese Witherspoon plays June Carter, but after a while I forgot it was them. They did a really good job, I reckon. They really looked the part, they really spoke the part, and really sung it. You could feel the humour, the struggles and the yearning in their lives. Can't say the same about the guy who played Elvis, which is the only thing that bugged me about the film. I mean, he did an all right job, but considering there are so, so many Elvis impersonators in the world, you'd think they'd get someone who looked and sounded a little truer. Ah well. Not really a big deal.The direction is really great, I thought. I like the way some of the shots helped you guess just what Johnny was thinking just as you needed to in the plot, if that makes sense. The filmmakers definitely have a love of the music and for the man. You can see there's a lot of care taken making the sets, reproducing the instruments and the colour of the 1950s and 1960s. There are a few things to think about besides the music too (father/son relationships, the nature of compassion, etc), but nothing feels forced, it seems to come naturally out of the story. It all feels very natural, actually, that sums up the style very well. Realistic, yet warm.There's only a couple of special features on the one disc edition, but it's enough for me. There's a commentary by director James Mangold, who describes why he wanted to make the film, what he was trying to evoke, and even reads some parts from the screenplay while its particular scene is playing. There's also ten deleted scenes, also with a commentary by Mangold, and the original theatrical trailer.Definitely worth a look for music fans, lovers of Johnny Cash and biopic watchers.

Newman,"[10, 10]","Having just seen the movie for the second time,just in time for the Oscars,I can truly say that this is one of the best musical biopics I've ever seen.The ""Man In Black"" stands tall next to last year's ""Ray"" as a testiment to the power of a well told story....especially if it's true.For this generation of movie goers,""Walk The Line"" is a real eye-opener in terms of showing younger audiences just how powerful an impact Johnny Cash made in the music world.For older audiences who've been fans of Cash for years,the film confirms what they already knew:Johnny Cash carried all of the weight of the misery he endured in his life in every dark vocal he sang.The film itself follows the new form of telling bios in that they try and have a ""moral"" to the story.In the case of ""Ray"",it was how a person with a disability could overcome to achieve great things.In ""Walk The Line"",the moral center of this tale is how the love of a good woman can save a man's soul.On that note,the film follows the rise of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) from his beginings as the ""black sheep"" youngest child to a poor cotton farming family,who was haunted by the death of his sainted big brother,to his stint in the Air Force,through his early recording years at the legendary Sun Records Studio,through his struggle with an addiction to alcohol and drugs,to his redemption thanks to his singing partner and friend,June Carter (Reese Witherspoon).Aside from being a great romantic tale,the film also serves as a lesson in music history.As Johnny rises to fame at Sun Records through early hits such as ""Cry,Cry,Cry"",""Get Rhythm"",and ""Folsom Prison Blues"",he goes out on tour with Sun's other rising young stars:Jerry Lee Lewis (played to looney perfection by Waylon Malloy),Carl Perkins,Roy Orbison,Waylon Jennings (played by his son,Shooter Jennings),and of course,Elvis Presley.For me personally,at 26,I only heard Cash's big hits like ""Walk The Line"" and ""Folsom"".I did not know he sang ""Get Rhythm"".The first time I saw the film,there were alot of 20-somethings in there like me who probably didn't know much about Cash.....I wonder if any of them went out and got one of his Greatest Hits Collections.....As I close this out,I'd like to point out something that I've seen other reviewers grumble about:Joaquin and Reese's singing.First off,NOBODY sounds like Johnny Cash.That being said,I give Phoenix an ""A"" for effort.Hey!At least he learned to play the guitar and tried to sound like Cash.That's what gave the film the weight of reality it needed.The same goes with Reese's singing and portrayal of June Carter.She may not've been ""note perfect"" in sounding like June....but I think her portrayal proves that she can act outside of ""fluffy"" romantic comedies.If you're looking for a damn good,not to mention entertaining,biopic....""Walk The Line"" fills the bill....Now....

I loved the music most of all and thought that Joaquin and Reese did a more than adequate job with the vocals. Considering the mega-star status of June and Johnny Cash, those were tall boots to fill! ;-)I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars for a couple of reasons. I agree with some of the other reviewers here in regards to how the movie seemed to dwell on Johnny Cash's addictions. Also the portrayal of his first wife as a first class BAG!!! (another B comes to mind actually). June Carter on the other hand is portrayed as a ""goodie two shoes"" throughout who can do no wrong, in spite of her hypocritical behavior of being twice divorced and committing adultery, but also supposedly being deeply religious.Given that they were portraying real people who still have many living family members, I think this could have been handled in a more sensitive and thoughtful way.

637417,A17IW44FV0HUTY,B00005JO1R,Glen Engel Cox,"[1, 1]","We missed this movie in the theater, and it finally popped up to the top in our netflix queue, a bit like cream rising to the top of the milk churn. This is an extremely well done biopic, that limits itself to the early career of Johnny Cash's life. The script is almost a little too clever, or perhaps the source material--Cash's own autobiographies--made things a little too clear, in that sometimes the connections between his actions and his childhood are so strong that it's like the screenwriter went in with a highlighter and marked the passages for you. For example, Cash and his brother go fishing in the first five minutes, and as they walk down the dirt road they run forward and slide in the dirt as well as balance the fishing poles in the palms of their hand. Later, when Cash leaves home to join the army, his joy in finally escaping the harsh confines of his father's house is shown by him running and sliding in the dirt, and then even later in the film he and June Carter go fishing, you see him balancing the pole in his hand, an indication of how much joy this is bringing him.While almost distracting, such clear connections don't get in the way of the story, and the screenwriters have done a great job in concentrating on the love story between Cash and Carter. Everything in this movie builds to that, showing exactly why Cash was a boozer and an addict, the struggle between his success and his first wife, and how the music connected him to Carter, who had her own issues as the scion of country music's first family. Both Phoenix and Witherspoon are wonderfully understated in their portrayals, especially in the darker sections which has to be one of the better representations on screen of drug and alcohol addiction.What's somewhat missing, although implied in several scenes, is a depiction of Cash and Carter's religious faith. The DVD contains some of the scenes that hit the cutting room floor and it looks like much of the more overt religious parts were excised in the final version, likely because they didn't feed as much into the courting part of their relationship and was more part of their lasting love for each other. If anything, this movie leaves you wanting more, to see a more complete life of Cash, and if anything, that's a triumph in itself.",4,A different kind of love story,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,2291,"['missed', 'movie', 'theater', 'finally', 'popped', 'up', 'top', 'netflix', 'queue', 'bit', 'cream', 'rising', 'top', 'milk', 'churn', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'biopic', 'early', 'career', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'life', 'script', 'almost', 'little', 'too', 'clever', 'perhaps', 'source', 'material', 'Cash', 'own', 'autobiographies', 'made', 'things', 'little', 'too', 'clear', 'connections', 'actions', 'childhood', 'are', 'so', 'strong', 'screenwriter', 'went', 'highlighter', 'marked', 'passages', 'example', 'Cash', 'brother', 'go', 'fishing', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'walk', 'dirt', 'road', 'run', 'forward', 'slide', 'dirt', 'as', 'well', 'balance', 'fishing', 'poles', 'palms', 'hand', 'Later', 'when', 'Cash', 'home', 'join', 'army', 'joy', 'finally', 'escaping', 'harsh', 'confines', 'father', 'house', 'shown', 'running', 'sliding', 'dirt', 'then', 'even', 'later', 'film', 'June', 'Carter', 'go', 'fishing', 'see', 'balancing', 'pole', 'hand', 'indication', 'how', 'much', 'joy', 'bringing', 'him.While', 'almost', 'distracting', 'such', 'clear', 'connections', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'story', 'screenwriters', 'have', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'concentrating', 'love', 'story', 'Cash', 'Carter', 'Everything', 'movie', 'showing', 'exactly', 'why', 'Cash', 'was', 'boozer', 'addict', 'struggle', 'success', 'first', 'wife', 'how', 'music', 'connected', 'Carter', 'who', 'had', 'own', 'issues', 'scion', 'country', 'music', 'first', 'family', 'Phoenix', 'Witherspoon', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'understated', 'portrayals', 'especially', 'darker', 'sections', 'be', 'one', 'better', 'representations', 'screen', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'addiction.What', 'somewhat', 'missing', 'implied', 'several', 'scenes', 'depiction', 'Cash', 'Carter', 'religious', 'faith', 'DVD', 'scenes', 'hit', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'much', 'more', 'overt', 'religious', 'parts', 'were', 'excised', 'final', 'version', 'likely', 'did', ""n't"", 'feed', 'as', 'much', 'courting', 'part', 'relationship', 'was', 'more', 'part', 'lasting', 'love', 'other', 'anything', 'movie', 'wanting', 'more', 'see', 'more', 'complete', 'life', 'Cash', 'anything', 'triumph']",Walk the Line

After viewing the DVD version of WALK THE LINE the reasons for that success must be attached to some sort of homage to Johnny Cash, an American icon of sorts.  Yes, his life and career are notable - the emergence of a legendary Country Western singer out of the elements of a warped childhood peaked by the accidental death of his older brother whom the father clearly preferred, and the torture of self doubt that haunted a man through an unsuccessful marriage and a thwarted love for fellow Country Western singer June Carter, his descent into alcohol and drugs, and his final victory over his demons - but isn't this the same story we see almost annually about famous stars whose backgrounds seem templates from this same mold?Joaquin Phoenix is a fine actor and has the courage to take on a variety of roles, succeeding in them all. And yes, he was able to sound like Johnny Cash (given the fact that even Cash's fans will admit it was not a voice of quality but of message).  Much the same could be said for Reese Witherspoon's tackling successfully the equally mediocre quality voice of June Carter - again it was her sassy style that made her a star, not her voice.  And perhaps that is the reason the writers and director elected to spend most of the screen time on the singing and concerts of Cash and Carter - leaving very little of the story of Cash's life except to outline form between songs.But if you condensed the actual acting time on the screen it falls into the overly familiar family clashes, drunken bouts, weaning off drugs, spats and eventual public displays of feelings that seem to be the formula for this genre of biopic.  Though Phoenix and to an extent Witherspoon do well with the material they are given, does the result merit Oscar attention?  That is up to the voters.  It seems to this viewer that there have been many finer performances by less publicized actors in the smaller films more worthy.  But then what are the Oscars for if not for PR for the movies.

This film whetted my appetite to know more since many reviews say it only hints at the real darkness in his life. The Spanish title is Johnny and June: Madness and Passion. I wholeheartedly agree about the passion aspect, Joaquin Phoenix is nigh on perfect as Cash from his stance, speech patterns to his on-stage persona, but we only see flashes of the madness (a few amphetamines too many, a Zeppelinesque outburst in his dressing room and a mano-a-maquina with his Massey Ferguson).The relationship with June is very well developed- and though not knowing much about her- I can only say that it's a perfectly believable love story. The music throughout is well chosen and this morning I woke up with Ring of Fire echoing around my mind (which makes a pleasant change from ""Can't get you out of my head""...).If this doesn't spark yet another Cash revival I don't know what will. Fantastic performances all round, a great soundtrack and a gripping story make for a very memorable film. I hope we see a sequel as the closing credits' ""They toured for 30 odd years then died"" doesn't really do justice to the rest of this incredible man's journey.

The movie takes us back to the days before Cash became the Man in Black, subjecting us to an insecure man who struggled with his marriage, love for June Carter and drug addictions, while soaring to the top of the country western charts in the late 50's.  The film is visually very satisfying to watch as Phoenix and Witherspoon subsume themselves into the roles of Cash and Carter.  There are a number of fun cameos such as Jerry Lee Lewis and a young Waylon Jennings played by his son Shooter.  The concert scenes are the most fun, as we get a sense of the road shows that were put on culminating in the immortal concert at Folsom State Prison.A deep sense of anger and resentment underlies Phoenix's performance, but one never really gets a full sense of the motivating reasons.  All the viewer is given are visual references to Cash's boyhood years when he lost his brother in a sawmill accident and of his father who never forgave him for leaving his brother alone.  Cash seemed to carry this with him throughout his early recording years, but the movie leads us to assume that he drew most of his music from vicarious outlets, creating the impression that this was a man that had been to hell and back and lived to tell the story, with him ultimately admitting in front of Folsom inmates that he never experienced what they were experiencing.It seemed that what Cash struggled most with was his newfound celebrity status, the unreciprocated love he felt for June Carter and his embattled marriage.  Unfortunately, we never see the charismatic man that thrilled audiences and fans.  Instead, we see a deeply troubled man unable to cope with his life, and June Carter eventually rescuing him from the hole he dug for himself.

I would have begun at Folsom Prison, and would have carried the movie from there deep into the 1970s, through and beyond Cash's network TV show.  Much of what the rest of the movie covered -- the years between Cash's first record in 1955, and his marriage to June Carter in 1968 -- I would have condensed and inserted as flashbacks during the post-Folsom action.Then again, that's why they didn't come to me to make the movie.This film had to introduce Johnny Cash to a 2500-screen audience that hadn't heard all that many records, or read either of his autobiographies.  Thus, the long simmering love story between Carter and Cash takes center stage, with all of the usual beats of a celebrity biopic: the meet cute, the stormy courtship, the offbeat marriage proposal.  All of this material is competently handled and exactly what you would expect.Joaquin Phoenix has been rightly praised for his performance.  He reportedly spent hundreds of hours learning the guitar and mastering That Voice, and every second of that preparation shows.  No celebrity biopic is going to stand if the actor is not up to par, and I cannot envision someone doing a better job than Phoenix of portraying Johnny Cash from ages 18 through 36.The real relevation for me, though, was Reese Witherspoon.  The movie takes it first real breath of air when she collides into Phoenix backstage at an early Cash concert in Texas.  Her singing voice is also marvelous.

Still, I had an indistinct respect for the man, and sensed his genuineness. Bottom line: for a guy who didn't bring much fan loyalty into ""Walk The Line,"" Cash's film biography, I found it tolerable.WTL takes us from Cash's dirt-poor Arkansas roots, where a family accident left him, the ill-favored son, at the mercy of his alcoholic father's demeaning rage. In the Air Force, Cash started writing the songs (though from what impulse the film does not say) that later made him famous. Initially more dogged than talented, Cash got involved with the rockabilly music of the day, toured with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and June Carter. The film does a great job illuminating the touring scene in rock and roll's very earliest years. The finale, showing the making if Johnny's famous live album at Folsom prison, was the climax of the film, showing Johnny finally having mastered himself and having a rollicking good time among men who saw into his tortured soul.ALERT! A few spoilers in this paragraph: WTL is chock full of clich&eacute;s about making it in the arts: the intrepid hero who battles self-doubt, family antagonism and an industry that doesn't think he has what it takes; with guts and desire he masters his instrument and becomes a great success, only to lose his way in anonymous sex, pills, booze or dope; After hitting bottom, the love of friends and family help him face the demons of the past, get him cleaned up and move onto greater successes. WTL, like ""Ray,"" mines these familiar veins.WTL is saved from mediocrity by a couple of factors. Joaquin Phoenix does a decent job portraying Cash. Sometimes he looks and acts very much like Cash, other times less so. It's hard, though to know whether he's playing a man who is painfully shy and not good with words, or one who is not that bright. Reese Witherspoon does a creditable job as June Carter Cash, though every now and then ""Legally Blonde"" peeks through. What really saves the film is the grit it took for Phoenix and Witherspoon to sing their own parts. With Johnny Cash, pure determination took over when all else failed. The leads were able to channel some of that energy into their roles.If it was up to me alone, I'd give WTL 3 stars, but my wife (an Cash fan from way back) thoroughly enjoyed it, earning it one extra star.",4,A decent biopic,1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,2412,"['Aside', 'Boy', 'named', 'Sue', 'Ring', 'Fire', 'couple', 'other', 'classic', 'hits', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'fan', 'Still', 'had', 'indistinct', 'respect', 'man', 'sensed', 'genuineness', 'Bottom', 'line', 'guy', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'much', 'fan', 'loyalty', 'Walk', 'Line', 'Cash', 'film', 'biography', 'found', 'Cash', 'dirt-poor', 'Arkansas', 'roots', 'where', 'family', 'accident', 'left', 'ill-favored', 'son', 'mercy', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'demeaning', 'rage', 'Air', 'Force', 'Cash', 'started', 'writing', 'songs', 'what', 'film', 'not', 'say', 'later', 'made', 'famous', 'Initially', 'more', 'dogged', 'talented', 'Cash', 'got', 'involved', 'rockabilly', 'music', 'day', 'toured', 'Elvis', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'June', 'Carter', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'illuminating', 'touring', 'scene', 'rock', 'roll', 'very', 'earliest', 'years', 'finale', 'showing', 'making', 'Johnny', 'famous', 'live', 'album', 'Folsom', 'prison', 'was', 'climax', 'film', 'showing', 'Johnny', 'finally', 'having', 'mastered', 'having', 'rollicking', 'good', 'time', 'men', 'who', 'saw', 'tortured', 'soul.ALERT', 'few', 'spoilers', 'paragraph', 'WTL', 'chock', 'full', 'clich', 'eacute', 'making', 'arts', 'intrepid', 'hero', 'who', 'self-doubt', 'family', 'antagonism', 'industry', ""n't"", 'think', 'what', 'guts', 'desire', 'instrument', 'great', 'success', 'only', 'lose', 'way', 'anonymous', 'sex', 'pills', 'booze', 'dope', 'hitting', 'bottom', 'love', 'friends', 'family', 'help', 'face', 'demons', 'past', 'get', 'cleaned', 'up', 'move', 'onto', 'greater', 'successes', 'WTL', 'Ray', 'familiar', 'veins.WTL', 'saved', 'mediocrity', 'couple', 'factors', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'decent', 'job', 'portraying', 'Cash', 'Sometimes', 'very', 'much', 'Cash', 'other', 'times', 'less', 'so', 'hard', 'know', 'playing', 'man', 'who', 'painfully', 'shy', 'not', 'good', 'words', 'one', 'who', 'not', 'bright', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'creditable', 'job', 'June', 'Carter', 'Cash', 'now', 'then', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'peeks', 'What', 'really', 'film', 'grit', 'took', 'Phoenix', 'Witherspoon', 'sing', 'own', 'parts', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'pure', 'determination', 'took', 'over', 'when', 'else', 'failed', 'leads', 'were', 'able', 'channel', 'energy', 'roles.If', 'was', 'up', 'alone', ""'d"", 'give', 'WTL', '3', 'stars', 'wife', 'Cash', 'fan', 'way', 'back', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'earning', 'one', 'extra', 'star']",Walk the Line
637441,A2BC978GQQEA2A,B00005JO1R,Jeffrey Pidgeon,"[4, 5]","""Walk The Line"", written by Gill Dennis and James Mangold; directed by James Mangold.""Walk The Line"" will inevitably be compared (at least from now until Oscar time) with ""Ray"", Taylor Hackford's popular biopic of Ray Charles.  Is it a better movie?  Is Joaquin Phoenix better than Jamie Foxx?  And so forth.  The answers, at least for me, vary quite at bit.Mr. Phoenix's Cash is simply not as vivid as Mr. Foxx's Charles.  His resemblance isn't as strong, and his vocals are initially shaky - the scene where Cash comes into his own during his first recording session isn't very successful - but he becomes more convincing as the film progresses.  Perhaps because I have no knowledge of June Carter's music, Reese Witherspoon's singing is far more successful.In general, though, I think ""Walk the Line"" is a more satisfying film than ""Ray"".  Granted, I grew up with Johnny Cash's music, and consider him to be one of the best country performers of all time, so I'm not sure how objective I can be.  What truly sets ""Walk The Line"" apart, though, isn't the music or the plot, but the choices of what the filmmakers decided to show us.The films opens strongly with the Folsom Prison concert - beginning as a distant thrum outside its walls, slowing building to a roar as we make our way toward the performers.  This bookends the film, with the main body of the story spanning about thirty years.Perhaps inevitably, much of the film has a great deal of plot similarities with ""Ray"" - nascent beginnings, a troubled childhood, marital discord, infidelities, substance abuse, creative conflicts and triumphs.  This familiar chain of events is a weakness, and keeps ""Walk"" from being a truly great movie.Its main strength is that it doesn't try to encapsule all of Cash's life, but chooses instead to focus on one of its most emotional, sympathetic periods.  His long term romance with June Carter is the film's true body, culminating in her acceptance of his proposal in 1969.  Reese Witherspoon is terrific in the role, giving the film much of its spark and spine. It's a lively, heartfelt performance that makes Mr. Phoenix's passionate pursuit of her so convincing.  Their chemistry together is strong, providing the film with extra heat.""Walk The Line"", then, reads more as a love story than a biography, which makes the inevitable summation paragraph (usually involving another forty or fifty years of the artist's career) less disappointing.  ""Ray's"" attempt at biography was far more frustrating in this regard.""Walk"" also gets more help from its supporting characters.  While ""Ray's"" supporting cast had a tendency to fade into the background, ""Walk The Line"" has a better spread of memorable performances, especially Waylon Payne's Jerry Lee Lewis, and Dallas Roberts making the most of his brief appearance as Sam Phillips.The use of music in the film is also strong, supporting the emotions of the content, rather than receding (as can often happen) into montage wallpaper.In the end, ""Walk The Line"" has its flaws, but is still a compelling and emotional story.  Like ""Chaplin"" before it, I'm definitely motivated to dig up Cash's two autobiographies and learn more.",3,Cash And Burn,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,3174,"['Walk', 'Line', 'written', 'Gill', 'Dennis', 'James', 'Mangold', 'directed', 'James', 'Mangold', 'Walk', 'Line', 'will', 'inevitably', 'be', 'compared', 'least', 'now', 'Oscar', 'time', 'Ray', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'popular', 'biopic', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'better', 'movie', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'better', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'so', 'forth', 'answers', 'least', 'vary', 'quite', 'bit.Mr', 'Phoenix', 'Cash', 'simply', 'not', 'as', 'vivid', 'Mr.', 'Foxx', 'Charles', 'resemblance', ""n't"", 'strong', 'vocals', 'are', 'initially', 'shaky', 'scene', 'where', 'Cash', 'own', 'first', 'recording', 'session', ""n't"", 'very', 'successful', 'more', 'convincing', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'have', 'knowledge', 'June', 'Carter', 'music', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'singing', 'far', 'more', 'successful.In', 'general', 'think', 'Walk', 'Line', 'more', 'satisfying', 'film', 'Ray', 'Granted', 'grew', 'up', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'music', 'consider', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'country', 'performers', 'time', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'objective', 'can', 'be', 'What', 'truly', 'Line', 'apart', ""n't"", 'music', 'plot', 'choices', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'decided', 'show', 'us.The', 'films', 'strongly', 'Folsom', 'Prison', 'concert', 'beginning', 'distant', 'thrum', 'walls', 'slowing', 'building', 'roar', 'make', 'way', 'performers', 'film', 'main', 'body', 'story', 'spanning', 'thirty', 'years.Perhaps', 'inevitably', 'much', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'plot', 'similarities', 'Ray', 'nascent', 'beginnings', 'troubled', 'childhood', 'marital', 'discord', 'infidelities', 'substance', 'abuse', 'creative', 'conflicts', 'triumphs', 'familiar', 'chain', 'events', 'weakness', 'Walk', 'being', 'truly', 'great', 'movie.Its', 'main', 'strength', ""n't"", 'try', 'encapsule', 'Cash', 'life', 'instead', 'focus', 'one', 'most', 'emotional', 'sympathetic', 'periods', 'long', 'term', 'romance', 'June', 'Carter', 'film', 'true', 'body', 'culminating', 'acceptance', 'proposal', '1969', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'terrific', 'role', 'giving', 'film', 'much', 'spark', 'spine', 'lively', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'Mr.', 'Phoenix', 'passionate', 'pursuit', 'so', 'convincing', 'chemistry', 'together', 'strong', 'providing', 'film', 'extra', 'heat', 'Walk', 'Line', 'then', 'more', 'love', 'story', 'biography', 'inevitable', 'summation', 'paragraph', 'usually', 'involving', 'forty', 'fifty', 'years', 'artist', 'career', 'less', 'disappointing', 'Ray', 'attempt', 'biography', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'frustrating', 'regard', 'Walk', 'also', 'more', 'help', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Ray', 'supporting', 'cast', 'had', 'tendency', 'fade', 'background', 'Walk', 'Line', 'better', 'spread', 'memorable', 'performances', 'especially', 'Waylon', 'Payne', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'Dallas', 'Roberts', 'making', 'most', 'brief', 'appearance', 'Sam', 'Phillips.The', 'use', 'music', 'film', 'also', 'strong', 'supporting', 'emotions', 'content', 'rather', 'receding', 'can', 'often', 'happen', 'montage', 'wallpaper.In', 'end', 'Walk', 'Line', 'flaws', 'still', 'compelling', 'emotional', 'story', 'Chaplin', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'motivated', 'dig', 'up', 'Cash', 'two', 'autobiographies', 'learn', 'more']",Walk the Line
637442,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B00005JO1R,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[2, 2]","Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon deliver two of the greatest performances of recent memory in this powerful film about one of country music's biggest stars: Johnny Cash.Young Johnny took an early interest in music while growing up on an Arkansas cotton farm during the great depression of the 1930s.  He was very close to his older brother, Jack, but his father Ray Cash (Robert Patrick) was extremely strict with young John and forbade him from listening to the radio.  John looked to Jack for love and support, but Jack died in a freak table saw accident, leaving young John alone.  John's guilt is not helped when his father blames him for the accident, saying that the wrong son died.During the Korean conflict, John enlisted in the air force and was sent to Germany.  There, he saw a film about Folsom Prison.  Moved by the film, John wrote a song entitled ""Folsom Prison Blues"".  Upon his discharge from the air force, John returned to the United States and married his girlfriend Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin).  After the marriage, John tried (unsuccessfully) to make a living as a door-to-door salesman.  His heart was really in music, and he managed to get an audition with Sun Records executive Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts).  Initially, the audition went poorly, as John and his group stuck to gospel music.  Sam informed the group that people were tired of listening to gospel and asked John if he had any other music to play.  John responded by playing ""Folsom Prison Blues"" and his career took off.After the success of the audition, John and his band began a tour with the likes of Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis, but there was one particular person who caught John's eye: June Carter (Reese Witherspoon).  Although there was an attraction between the two, both were married to other people at the time.  But the chemistry was definitely there, as evidenced by their magic on-stage performances of such great songs as ""Jackson"", ""Walk the Line"", and ""Ring of Fire"" (which was written by June).  The two toured on and off for several years, and the strain began to take its toll on John.  By the time the decade of the 1960s began, John was fighting a battle against amphetamines.  His marriage to Vivian ended and he sought help from June to overcome his drug problem.  He moved into a new lakefront home after his divorce from Vivian.  While fighting his drug problem, he spent a great deal of time reading letters from prison inmates.  These letters led him to take an idea of a live concert from Folsom Prison to the executives at Columbia Records.  Initially rebuffed, John told them that they could destroy the tapes if they didn't like the live recording.  However, John's ""Live At Folsom Prison"" went on to become one of the biggest-selling albums ever made.After the Folsom Prison concert, John, June, and the others went to Ontario, Canada for another concert.  During the performance of ""Jackson"", John asked June to marry him.  He had asked her many times before, but was  turned down each time.  This time, however, June said yes, and they were married for 35 years until both passed away in 2003.  They spent their time with their families at the lake house fishing and enjoyng their family.This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are simply perfect as Johnny and June, and both do their own singing in the movie.  Joaquin sounds exactly like Johnny did, and Reese was the perfect choice to play June.  Her voice is excellent as well.  The acting throughout the movie is great, and the songs bring back many memories.  Its easy to see why this movie was such a hit with so many movie critics.I give this movie my highest recommendation.

637443,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00005JO1R,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[4, 5]","This past weekend I was able to watch this film and Joaquin Phoenix wears Johnny Cash like a suit. He isn't doing a Rich Little impersonation, you don't rub your eyes in disbelief, but he channels a man so distinct in appearance and voice to a level that is beyond admirable. One of the traits that made Johnny Cash a legend was that nobody sounded or looked like him. Short of a computer generated Cash walking around in his own bio-pic like one of those John Wayne beer commercials this is the definitive representation.And yet Phoenix may not give the best performance in the film.Reese Witherspoon more than holds up her end in a role that easily could have been reduced to a clich&eacute;d bumpkin. Witherspoon portrays the on-stage June in the way June portrayed her own ""character"", the stage persona that people adored, while giving her the resolve and inner strength to be the woman who tamed a hell-bent, grizzly bear of a man like John.The chemistry of Phoenix and Witherspoon together in any scene, but their on-stage duets in particular, are truthful in a way that resonates long after the credits. I know that unless you have been living in a cave for the past week you have likely been bombarded with the word that the actors sing themselves without use of lip syncing. I have to admit they generally seem forced and uncomfortable to me, the moment when I stop experiencing the story and feel reminded that I am watching a movie. Rarely I feel that in this film. I never felt that their singing took the focus of the film, but the performances work with the story like no other music bio I have ever seen. I never felt as if I was being led through the catalog, the songs felt as organic and natural as any spoken dialog in a great narrative.This film far exceeded my expectations and with a true feeling of satisfaction.",4,Johnny Cash was sure one unique individual.,1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,1836,"['past', 'weekend', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'film', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'suit', ""n't"", 'doing', 'Rich', 'Little', 'impersonation', 'do', ""n't"", 'rub', 'eyes', 'disbelief', 'man', 'so', 'distinct', 'appearance', 'voice', 'level', 'admirable', 'One', 'traits', 'made', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'legend', 'was', 'nobody', 'sounded', 'looked', 'Short', 'computer', 'generated', 'Cash', 'walking', 'around', 'own', 'bio-pic', 'one', 'John', 'Wayne', 'beer', 'commercials', 'definitive', 'representation.And', 'yet', 'Phoenix', 'may', 'not', 'give', 'best', 'performance', 'film.Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'more', 'end', 'role', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'reduced', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'bumpkin', 'Witherspoon', 'on-stage', 'June', 'way', 'June', 'portrayed', 'own', 'character', 'stage', 'persona', 'people', 'adored', 'giving', 'resolve', 'inner', 'strength', 'be', 'woman', 'who', 'tamed', 'hell-bent', 'grizzly', 'bear', 'man', 'John.The', 'chemistry', 'Phoenix', 'Witherspoon', 'together', 'scene', 'on-stage', 'duets', 'particular', 'are', 'truthful', 'way', 'long', 'credits', 'know', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'cave', 'past', 'week', 'have', 'likely', 'been', 'bombarded', 'word', 'actors', 'sing', 'use', 'lip', 'syncing', 'have', 'admit', 'generally', 'seem', 'forced', 'uncomfortable', 'moment', 'when', 'stop', 'experiencing', 'story', 'feel', 'reminded', 'am', 'watching', 'movie', 'Rarely', 'feel', 'film', 'never', 'felt', 'singing', 'took', 'focus', 'film', 'performances', 'work', 'story', 'other', 'music', 'bio', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'being', 'led', 'catalog', 'songs', 'felt', 'organic', 'natural', 'spoken', 'dialog', 'great', 'narrative.This', 'film', 'far', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'true', 'feeling', 'satisfaction']",Walk the Line
637444,A680RUE1FDO8B,B00005JO1R,Jerry Saperstein,"[2, 3]","Stars Phoenix and Witherspoon are the movie. Their performances are top-drawer as, surprisingly, is their singing. Phoenix worked hard to master the tics and idiosyncracies of Johnny Cash. In fact, having seen Cash in concert on several occasions, I occasionally felt that some of the signature gestures, such as the pout and guitar slinging were a bit overdone.The storyline wasn't all that engrossing. Too much emphasis for me on a few selected episodes from Cash's life and nothing at all mentioned about many of Cash's excesses.Johnny Cash was a solid performer and also a man who made many poor choices in his life and lived with them. I don't think he would have been offended to see incidents like his firing by Grand Ole Opry included in the film, considering that he more than made up for that behavior in later years.Overall though, it's a pretty good film.Jerry",4,"Fine performances, episodic storytelling",1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,872,"['Stars', 'Phoenix', 'Witherspoon', 'are', 'movie', 'performances', 'are', 'top-drawer', 'surprisingly', 'singing', 'Phoenix', 'worked', 'hard', 'master', 'tics', 'idiosyncracies', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'fact', 'having', 'seen', 'Cash', 'concert', 'several', 'occasions', 'occasionally', 'felt', 'signature', 'gestures', 'such', 'pout', 'guitar', 'slinging', 'were', 'bit', 'overdone.The', 'storyline', 'was', ""n't"", 'engrossing', 'Too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'few', 'selected', 'episodes', 'Cash', 'life', 'nothing', 'mentioned', 'many', 'Cash', 'excesses.Johnny', 'Cash', 'was', 'solid', 'performer', 'also', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'many', 'poor', 'choices', 'life', 'lived', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'offended', 'see', 'incidents', 'firing', 'Grand', 'Ole', 'Opry', 'included', 'film', 'considering', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'behavior', 'later', 'years.Overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'film.Jerry']",Walk the Line

Guild,"[0, 0]","I saw the movie last night and enjoyed it as much as any movie I've seen in a long time.However, my enjoyment must be tempered with the fact that I have been an admirer of Cash from the beginning. I first saw him in concert in Montreal in 1969 which by the way,was a tour where he brought along The Statlers.I have most of his music and have read a number of books about him.He was a legend at that time and already had most of his hard times behind him,but his legend continued to grow right up to the end.Being a Country Music fan for 60 years,I have had a lot of favourites but when all's said and done Cash, in my opinion, is the best of the best;and there have been a lot of great artistsover the years.There is nobody that even comes close,except maybe Hank Williams Sr. but the fact that his life was cut so short at 29,and Cash 's lasted so much longer,makes the difference.Even Cash,as great as he was,never accomplished as much in any short period as did Williams.To me, it's unimaginable what Williams would have done if he had lived as long as Cash.All that said and done,how does one tell the story of Johnny Cash in a 2 hour movie or even a book? The answer is simply,you can't.What this movie does, is give a snapshot of his youth,a brief glance at his Air Force days,a quick summary of the early days at Sun Records,then a fairly detailed look at his interest in and proposal of marriage to June Carter.How exactly true the details are really don't matter much.The bottom line is that June Carter was the strength that held JR together and gave him the will to continue and become the great success that he was.The foundation of that strengh was faith and love. We saw it blossom and show itself all through the years;but never more on display than when together they sang ""Jackson"",way back in those days portrayed in the movie, as well as every time they appeared over the years.The movie ends with June accepting John's proposal during a concert at Massey Hall,here in Toronto.Although one might argue,I believe that was the real beginning of Cash becomingthe legend he did.Had June not been there for John,he might well have mirrored the the destruction of Williams.So,what this movie does,rather than tell the whole life and times of Johnny Cash,it centers in on that brief period where Cash was on the edge of perdition,things could have gone either way,and probably the wrong way,and it was the union of June and John that tipped the scales.This movie is excellent in showing the single factor that had the biggest inpact on John's life;not the songs he wrote,the concerts he performed,the causes he championed,the people he loved and helped,the image he portrayed;nothing comes close to the love they had for each other and their faith in God.If you are a fan of Cash,this is a movie you will not want to miss.",5,"""Because you're mine,I walk the Line""",1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,2834,"['saw', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'much', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time.However', 'enjoyment', 'must', 'be', 'tempered', 'fact', 'have', 'been', 'admirer', 'Cash', 'beginning', 'first', 'saw', 'concert', 'Montreal', '1969', 'way', 'was', 'tour', 'where', 'brought', 'along', 'Statlers.I', 'have', 'most', 'music', 'have', 'read', 'number', 'books', 'him.He', 'was', 'legend', 'time', 'already', 'had', 'most', 'hard', 'times', 'legend', 'continued', 'grow', 'right', 'up', 'end.Being', 'Country', 'Music', 'fan', '60', 'years', 'have', 'had', 'lot', 'favourites', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'Cash', 'opinion', 'best', 'best', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'great', 'years.There', 'nobody', 'even', 'close', 'maybe', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'Sr.', 'fact', 'life', 'was', 'cut', 'so', 'short', '29', 'Cash', 'lasted', 'so', 'much', 'longer', 'difference.Even', 'Cash', 'as', 'great', 'was', 'never', 'accomplished', 'much', 'short', 'period', 'did', 'Williams.To', 'unimaginable', 'what', 'Williams', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'had', 'lived', 'as', 'long', 'Cash.All', 'said', 'done', 'how', 'one', 'tell', 'story', 'Johnny', 'Cash', '2', 'hour', 'movie', 'even', 'book', 'answer', 'simply', ""can't.What"", 'movie', 'give', 'snapshot', 'youth', 'brief', 'glance', 'Air', 'Force', 'days', 'quick', 'summary', 'early', 'days', 'Sun', 'Records', 'then', 'fairly', 'detailed', 'look', 'interest', 'proposal', 'marriage', 'June', 'Carter.How', 'exactly', 'true', 'details', 'are', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'much.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'June', 'Carter', 'was', 'strength', 'held', 'JR', 'together', 'gave', 'will', 'continue', 'become', 'great', 'success', 'foundation', 'strengh', 'was', 'faith', 'love', 'saw', 'blossom', 'show', 'years', 'never', 'more', 'display', 'when', 'together', 'sang', 'Jackson', 'way', 'back', 'days', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'time', 'appeared', 'years.The', 'movie', 'June', 'accepting', 'John', 'proposal', 'concert', 'Massey', 'Hall', 'here', 'Toronto.Although', 'one', 'might', 'argue', 'believe', 'was', 'real', 'beginning', 'Cash', 'becomingthe', 'legend', 'June', 'not', 'been', 'there', 'John', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'mirrored', 'destruction', 'Williams.So', 'what', 'movie', 'rather', 'tell', 'whole', 'life', 'times', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'brief', 'period', 'where', 'Cash', 'was', 'edge', 'perdition', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'probably', 'wrong', 'way', 'was', 'union', 'June', 'John', 'tipped', 'scales.This', 'movie', 'excellent', 'showing', 'single', 'factor', 'had', 'biggest', 'inpact', 'John', 'life', 'not', 'songs', 'wrote', 'concerts', 'performed', 'causes', 'championed', 'people', 'loved', 'helped', 'image', 'portrayed', 'nothing', 'close', 'love', 'had', 'other', 'faith', 'God.If', 'are', 'fan', 'Cash', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'want', 'miss']",Walk the Line

I am a Johnny Cash fan, a June Carter fan, a Joaquin Phoenix fan and a Reese Witherspoon adorer but, folks, if there ever was a standard-issue Hollywood biopic this is it.  Utterly predictable start to finish, gaping holes in the chronicle of a life and for me the biggest problem is that the June Carter portrayed here has so little to do with the real June Carter.  The Carter Family singers, who loomed large over all of June's life and every facet of it, are barely referred to here.  Beyond that, June began as a country comic with goofy facial expressions, goofy body poses, goofy dancing, an aw-shucks-I-don't-know-much-beyond-the-holler persona and very little hint of beauty in her face, body or the way she dressed.  The evidence is there in dozens of T.V. shows.  When Johnny Cash came into her life a Cinderella transformation occurred.  She became a beautiful, poised true artist, and that is I believe as many do because Johnny Cash was the first person in her life to see that beautiful, that poise and that artistry.  Growing up in both a famous family and poverty and with endless expectations of what a girl and woman should be, June was a deep soul, often melancholy and wistful.Reese Witherspoon captures barely anything of the real June; we instead get an All American sweetheart.  Reality aside, the film is strictly color-by-numbers; all the Sun Records passages, all the performances represent a Hollywood summation of what happened. There's never any sense of really being there, always every sense of a movie set and movie scene. The photography and cinematography are gorgeous and the music is spot-on, though it would be hard to ruin this music.  Why Witherspoon got an Oscar I can't fathom.  Her performance is capable but a far piece down the road from an Oscar moment, though I have no doubt she could deliver many Oscar moments.  In fact, I think ""Legally Blonde"" is a more important film, even though it is a comedy and Oscar has always had a tough time rewarding comedy.Still, this film is well-worth getting to see what went right and what went wrong and how difficult it is to put real life on film when it's not real life.",3,Is that all there is?,1314576000,"08 29, 2011",2011,2225,"['Given', 'honors', 'film', 'got', 'remain', 'still', 'mystified', 'why', 'am', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'fan', 'June', 'Carter', 'fan', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'fan', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'adorer', 'folks', 'ever', 'was', 'standard-issue', 'Hollywood', 'biopic', 'Utterly', 'predictable', 'start', 'finish', 'gaping', 'holes', 'chronicle', 'life', 'biggest', 'problem', 'June', 'Carter', 'portrayed', 'here', 'so', 'little', 'do', 'real', 'June', 'Carter', 'Carter', 'Family', 'singers', 'who', 'loomed', 'large', 'June', 'life', 'facet', 'are', 'barely', 'referred', 'here', 'Beyond', 'June', 'began', 'country', 'comic', 'goofy', 'facial', 'expressions', 'goofy', 'body', 'poses', 'goofy', 'dancing', ""aw-shucks-I-don't-know-much-beyond-the-holler"", 'persona', 'very', 'little', 'hint', 'beauty', 'face', 'body', 'way', 'dressed', 'evidence', 'there', 'dozens', 'T.V', 'shows', 'When', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'came', 'life', 'Cinderella', 'transformation', 'occurred', 'became', 'beautiful', 'poised', 'true', 'artist', 'believe', 'many', 'do', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'was', 'first', 'person', 'life', 'see', 'beautiful', 'poise', 'artistry', 'Growing', 'up', 'famous', 'family', 'poverty', 'endless', 'expectations', 'what', 'girl', 'woman', 'should', 'be', 'June', 'was', 'deep', 'soul', 'often', 'melancholy', 'wistful.Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'captures', 'barely', 'anything', 'real', 'June', 'instead', 'get', 'American', 'sweetheart', 'Reality', 'aside', 'film', 'strictly', 'color-by-numbers', 'Sun', 'Records', 'passages', 'performances', 'represent', 'Hollywood', 'summation', 'what', 'happened', 'never', 'sense', 'really', 'being', 'there', 'always', 'sense', 'movie', 'set', 'movie', 'scene', 'photography', 'cinematography', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'music', 'spot-on', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'ruin', 'music', 'Why', 'Witherspoon', 'got', 'Oscar', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'performance', 'capable', 'far', 'down', 'road', 'Oscar', 'moment', 'have', 'doubt', 'could', 'deliver', 'many', 'Oscar', 'moments', 'fact', 'think', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'more', 'important', 'film', 'even', 'comedy', 'Oscar', 'always', 'had', 'tough', 'time', 'rewarding', 'comedy.Still', 'film', 'well-worth', 'getting', 'see', 'what', 'went', 'right', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'how', 'difficult', 'put', 'real', 'life', 'film', 'when', 'not', 'real', 'life']",Walk the Line

After watching it, however, I was amazed. It is close to a perfect movie.Joaquin and Reese really put a lot into their performances. I was skeptical about them doing their own singing when I heard about it, but they did a super job. While they're clearly no Johnny and June, the two's singing fits in perfectly with the movie. Anyway, I was very satisfied with this. It didn't change history to attract viewers, and it didn't breeze over the hard parts of his life.

Anyone could watch this movie without knowing anything about him and just fall in love with the movie. Joaquin Phoenix is just awesome here as Johny Cash and even puts his oscar nominated performance in Gladiator to shame. I don't know what kind of expressions the real  Johny Cash made but Phoenix literly becomes someone else here almost as if he's possessed.Cash has a wife and a family and his dream job is to be a singer and after that happens his money is there to support his family but he isn't. Then he meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) and that complicates his marriage even more since he falls for June instantly. He gets June to to  sing with him which makes his wife jealous, especially when he starts hanging June's pictures all over the walls. On top of that he becomes a pill popper that washes down the pills with beer. Which gets in the way of his marriage, his dream job and keeping his friendship with his dream girl. All that might sound depressing but you'll feel uplifted and happy by the end.Reese Witherspoon is excellent here and I hear critics say that Philip Seymour Hoffman should win for Capote and that Reese should win best actress. I agree, she should win best actres but how could anyone say she should win and that Joaquin Phoenix shouldn't ? If you listen to the real Johny Cash and the real June Carter sing in the end credits, Phoenix sounds exactly like Johny Cash. While Witherspoon just sorta sounds like June Carter but barely. I'm not knocking her performance, she has a lovely voice and great chemestry with Phoenix period. I just don't see how you could watch this movie and walk away saying that any other actor deserves the award more than Phoenix . I'd love to see them both walk away with oscars.

I am not a big Ray Charles fan, I like his unique voice and some of his ballads were very sentimental and the movie ""Ray"" was a good adaptation of his life, as I have known it through reading and such.  However, this review is about ""Walk the Line.""  I particularly did not want to see it.  It was about country music singer which I am not a fan of and starred Mrs. Witherspoon who I thought would not be able to pull off the role.  However, I am a fan of Mr. Phoenix's work, therefore, I picked up a rental and watched it.  What I did not know is Mr. Phoenix did pretty much all the singing in the film and to even resemble Johnny Cash's voice with any kind of accuracy, like he did, is well spooky.  I mean, how many men can sing that low, in that characteristic Johnny Cash voice?  Well Phoenix nailed it, which proved again, that this actor is going to have a long career.  Not only was his singing phenomenal, but his acting as well.  Now, for Mrs. Witherspoon, the quirky blond with no real serious, dramatic roles, nailed her performance.  Now, I am wondering why ""Walk the Line"" was not nominated for best picture.  I can understand why Mr. Phoenix did not win best actor, because there were a lot of great actors there and I know that he will get his some day.  However, not nominating ""Walk the Line"" when you have movies such as ""Capote,"" ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Good Night and Good luck (why was this film even nominated)"" and then ""Crash"" which won!  Which I thought was good, but not as good as ""Walk the Line.""  If you are not a Cash fan, like I am not, or care about the period of time that this takes place, like I wasn't particularly caring about, or a country music fan, like I definitely am not, I suggest that you see it anyway.  The acting was superb, the chemistry, the script, everything.

The story of Johnny Cash is in some ways a typical one-abusive father, beaten down child, escapes into the music world, tries to be a family man but the rigors of the road lead him into drugs and alcohol. Typical but for Cash's incredible luck in having run into June Carter, who, with her family, forces him to get off the pills. Witherspoon in this movie goes from being the silly, cute ""Legally Blond""  type to becoming the most loyal of friends, but tough too. Apparently both Phoenix and Witherspoon did their own singing-Witherspoon is no singer, and I thought her first number was just a poor dubbing job, but this didn't ruin it for me for a second.

I was initally irritated that Joaquin Phoenix was cast in a role that seemed too big for him; in fact too big for most actors to attempt. But he truly melts into the role and I felt like I was getting a glimpse into Cash as a human being beyond his performance persona.Phonix and Reese Witherspoon are wonderful together as Johnny Cash and June Carter. The chemistry between the two feels very real and natural. June Carter was an amazing woman and artist and Reese Withespoon gives you a sense of both her talent, grit, and vulnerability. Good as she was, Reese Witherspoon's performance didn't seem worthy of a best actress Oscar.As enjoyable as the movie was, I found myself getting restless by the second half. I began to feel like I was seeing the same scene over and over again. Johnny Cash does drugs, gets in trouble, disapoints June, and pleads with her not to leave. However well acted, I didn't get any sense of growth or progress in Johnny Cash.The ending also makes it sound like ""and they got married and lived happily ever after"" Johnny Cash still had a stint in prison , a few relapses, other problems ahead of fim although there's no doubt that June and his children went a long way towards moderating his excesses.So great performances, nice sense of ""being there"" during some CW history in the making but leaves an enormous gap between the elderly Cash who had come to a level of peace with his demons and the more experienced but still wrestling with demons Cash we see at the end of the film.",3,Fantastic performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon but story lags,1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,1556,"['performances', 'film', 'are', 'awesome', 'was', 'initally', 'irritated', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'was', 'cast', 'role', 'seemed', 'too', 'big', 'fact', 'too', 'big', 'most', 'actors', 'attempt', 'truly', 'role', 'felt', 'was', 'getting', 'glimpse', 'Cash', 'human', 'being', 'performance', 'persona.Phonix', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'are', 'wonderful', 'together', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'June', 'Carter', 'chemistry', 'two', 'feels', 'very', 'real', 'natural', 'June', 'Carter', 'was', 'amazing', 'woman', 'artist', 'Reese', 'Withespoon', 'sense', 'talent', 'grit', 'vulnerability', 'Good', 'was', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'performance', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'worthy', 'best', 'actress', 'Oscar.As', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'was', 'found', 'getting', 'restless', 'second', 'half', 'began', 'feel', 'was', 'seeing', 'same', 'scene', 'over', 'again', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'drugs', 'trouble', 'disapoints', 'June', 'pleads', 'not', 'leave', 'However', 'well', 'acted', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'growth', 'progress', 'Johnny', 'Cash.The', 'ending', 'also', 'sound', 'got', 'married', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'still', 'had', 'stint', 'prison', 'few', 'relapses', 'other', 'problems', 'ahead', 'fim', 'doubt', 'June', 'children', 'went', 'long', 'way', 'moderating', 'excesses.So', 'great', 'performances', 'nice', 'sense', 'being', 'there', 'CW', 'history', 'making', 'enormous', 'gap', 'elderly', 'Cash', 'who', 'had', 'come', 'level', 'peace', 'demons', 'more', 'experienced', 'still', 'wrestling', 'demons', 'Cash', 'see', 'end', 'film']",Walk the Line

""Will you marry me?"", or ""One day I am going to marry you."" Followed closely by an ecstatic ""YES!"" Only for struggling song-writer Johnny Cash life hasn't been so kind and when he meets June Carter this task will be easier said then done. After a stint in prison on drugs related charges, and the death of his brother in a sawing accident, of which he feels responsible, when treated with contempt by his father Ray (Robert Patric who starred in James Mangold's earlier film 'Cop Land' and James Cameron's 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day) who has left issues between himself and his living son unresolved for years. It is while in jail, and after his release, where Johnny Cash decides unusually to make music for those in prison, because he can relate to them the most I guess, and because he's had first hand experience there, and so he dismisses most concert stages in the process. It is during a live function Johnny attends while trying to break into the music industry, around the time of Elvis, and make a name for himself that his eye is taken instantly by a girl called June Carter. It's the two leads lively, often witty repartee that got my interest and kept it. I felt very much like Johnny Cash, as well as feeling like I was back in high school, where feelings are hightened, when any girl could catch my eye, or anyone's for that matter, and  playfully make promises of staying together forever, but for some, drifting apart is the most likely of outcomes. I have to say I really admire the determination of Johnny Cash as he pursues the girl of his dreams and her refusal makes Johnny more determined then ever to make her his.At the start of the film I thought, 'Walk The Line' felt like something out of 'The Andy Griffith Show' intoduction, because it has a fishing poll in it, just obviously without the infamous whistling tune that accompanies Andy Griffth and a little Ronny Howard walking down to the river with their fishing poles.I saw a special sneek preview of 'Walk The Line' weeks before it hit Australian cinemas on February 2nd 2006. Instead I saw it on 25th January 2006. 'Walk The Line' marks my second special screening of a Reese Witherspoon film before the official release date. The first film I saw of hers before everyone else was 'Legally Blonde 2: Red White and Blonde'. So I felt very fortunate and honoured to be part of another special screening. Before seeing the film I really knew nothing about the real-life late singers Johnny Cash or June Carter and where their lives lead them on tour after tour. It is a story of love, but also many others that this 'Walk The Line' film travels along, and sometimes crosses over, as it explores the entertaining life of Johnny Cash. At times it did feel a little like 'Ray', which is a great movie, I just felt 'Walk The Line' was much better.  All I knew of this film before I saw it, was the poster art of Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon in a passionate embrace, as they bask in the warmth of the spotlight together; both bodies totally consumed with desire for each other. As well as one preview for the film, which includes a totally cool still of the actors of today as their characters in a black and white comic book black line drawing sketch, as their names appear on the screen giving the preview a really neat edge.It took seven years for 'Walk The Line' to come to the screen. It fortunately had the blessing of both Johnny and June and they both worked hard with director James Mangold (Girl, Interrupted) to get the film right. One of the best things about 'Walk The Line' is the real people also got to pick who they wanted to play them in the film. Joaquin Phoenix was the ideal choice for Johnny Cash, who decided on him after enjoying Joaquin's performance in 'Gladiator'. The only thing I know about June's choice was that she wanted Reese Witherspoon, and that they never got to meet. June Carter you certainly know talent when you see it! One of her family told Reese her breasts weren't big enough, but that's never a concern for me, and it thankfully wasn't for anyone making the film. Amazingly to some both actors really sing and play, and it was equally hard at times for each individual actor, but both Joaquin and Reese really smoulder together, and it's a real joy watching them work together. Even though initially Reese hadn't planned on singing in the film, I knew she could sing beautifully after watching her in 2004s 'Vanity Fair', and she really doesn't disappoint here. I'm so glad there is a soundtrack featuring the actors singing themselves. It was something I hoped for while watching the film. I also really enjoy Reese's scenes with the autoharp even though that was a difficult instrument for her, however you'd never know because she pulls it off effortlessly. I'm already a huge fan of Reese Witherspoon's work, but here all her excellent work in previous films is put to the test and she succeeds with a performance I'm very proud of. Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Pheonix are the only two actors I imagine in these roles. There is no one else. Although now I'm certain there are girls everywhere hoping for a 'Walk The Line 2'. I never see it happening, but just for fun, and to prove how popular this movie seems here are a few examples. I read Kirsten Dunst was hanging out with Joaquin Pheonix around the time of this film, so maybe she wished she was Reese. I wouldn't blame her if she did wish that. I read an article about Amanda Bynes, who loves physical comedy, but during an interview for her film 'She's The Man' wanted an Oscar one day like Reese Witherspoon recieved for 'Walk the Line'. Amanda Bynes says... ""She won a role in 'Walk The Line' where, though it's serious content, she was playing a goofy character. I feel I could easily do that."" - Amanda Bynes. Accept no imitations or substitutes! 'Walk The Line' goes it's own path and takes it's time getting there but it's worth the long haul. Purhaps best of all is the fact you don't have to love country music to enjoy this film. This is a film worth waiting in line for. I'm sure the DVD commentry with director James Mangold will be very informative and a delight to listen to. I've no doubt in my mind 'Walk The Line' will become a classic in years to come. I feel the real Johnny Cash and June Carter would commend this film and be so proud of their choice of actors, who keep their spirit alive, as both actors step out onto the stage and glow like the angels the real singers have now become, they are forever immortalised in the warm radiant glow of bright lights on the silver screen for all to now admire, desire, and aspire.",5,"Before the tune 'A

Let's just look at the script as it was written, not as someone else might have written it. Let's just consider the singing of Phoenix and Witherspoon and not make minute comparisons to Cash and Carter. In other words, when you consider this film on its own merits, as a biop and entertainment, you've got to love it. One gets a good sense of Cash's struggles with his father's rejection, his brother's early death, his frustrations with his first wife, June Carter's continuous rejection of Cash's marriage proposals, and Cash's addictions to pills and alcohol. One also is immensely entertained by the driving sound track, the great musical numbers, the early touring with Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis, and the fiesty and energetic performance of Witherspoon as a charismatic June Carter. Phoenix and Witherspoon are terrific together. Their chemistry is palpable and infectious. And although, like all commercial films, some of the facts no doubt have been bent to add drama to the story, I loved the whole thing. I just wonder why such a supposedly tough guy like Cash didn't go after his rejecting and downright ugly father. I also wonder where all his talent came from and how he got that voice and style.

While there's a relative brief sequence of his early years growing up on an Arkansas cotton farm, an even briefer sequence of his time in the Air Force in the early 50s, the film really begins in 1955 when, failing as a door-to-door salesman and wannabe gospel singer, he cuts a rock 'n' roll record for Sun Studios in Memphis and his career as a CW crooner takes off. The film ends with his marriage to June Carter in 1968. In between, against the backdrop of early hits, it focuses on his failed marriage to first wife Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), his self-destructive abuse of amphetamines, and rocky relationship with singer/actress Carter (Reese Witherspoon), a twice-divorced single mother of two.The real treat of WALK THE LINE is watching Phoenix and Witherspoon amaze with Oscar-caliber dramatic performances. Who would have suspected that the latter was capable of anything other than light comedy?In case you haven't seen the film and you're wondering, Phoenix and Witherspoon themselves sing the Cash/Carter material; they're surprisingly effective. Mind you, I've never been such a Cash fan that I've possessed any of his albums, and I've only previously downloaded one of his songs (""City of New Orleans""). Indeed, when Phoenix and Witherspoon recreate the Cash/Carter duet of ""Jackson"", my first thought was: Didn't Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood do that?Coming out of the screening, my wife remarked that Phoenix sounded very much like Johnny himself. My response was a non-committal but prudent ""Mmmm"". Back home at the computer, I downloaded a couple more Cash songs, including his ""Jackson"" duet with Carter. To my ears, the real Cash had a singing voice that was slightly hoarser, and with a more pronounced slow drawl than Joaquin's version. While that doesn't detract from the actor's performance, it may cause purists to grumble.The film's opening scene is of two guards on a tower at Folsom Prison listening to the bass ""thump, thump, thump"" washing over the prison yard from the hall in which Cash is about to perform his famous concert before the inmates. My wife and I were sitting in the front row of the studio screening theater and the sound reverberated through our bones. I knew then that WALK THE LINE was going to be an exceptional film.",5,Hmmm.

Upon first hearing that there was a Johnny Cash biopic film starring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, I didn't really think much of it.  I thought they're just trying to ""cash"" in on the popularity of ""Ray"" from last year.  And the actors!  I couldn't really picture Phoenix and Witherspoon doing justice to Johnny and June.  While both are fine actors it really takes a special talent and can be really risky portraying country music legends such as Cash and Carter.  Then, I heard that ""Walk the line"" got good reviews from a number of critics.  And, my friends who saw it also spoke very highly of it.  After seeing it yesterday, I consider it the best movie of the year and worthy of oscar nominations.The story focuses mainly on Johnny and June Carter.  There are alot of similarities in this film with ""Ray"", but the main difference is that the complexity of his relationship with June is shown more here as a saving grace than Ray's wife was.  The director allows this focus to give insight to how songs were written by both Cash and Carter.  It's interesting after hearing Cash and Carter's songs for so long to finally see the circumstances surrounding their lives which inspired them.Phoenix and Witherspoon both give the performance of their careers.  Both their voices are amazingly accurate to the originals.  With Phoenix managing to hit all the right notes with a suprisingly almost perfect timbre, while Witherspoon sings well and even with a Carter-ish growl.  The chemistry these two posess between eachother makes it easy for the audience to believe Johnny's love for June as well as June's reluctance to marry Johnny for so many years.  Both deserve a nomination for best actor and actress, since they both nail their respective parts.  Out of the two, I think Phoenix is more likely to win an oscar because his portrayal of Johnny is so beleivable.  Johnny's vulnerability and wild side are portrayed with ease by Phoenix.  Phoenix has a talent for giving deep, probing characters with an emotional side and he not only does that but he seems to channel Cash through him and never once does the audience look at him and not think he is Cash.  Kudos to the rest of the cast but Witherspoon and Phoenix really make the film as well as the writers and director James Mangold.""Walk the line"" is touching, powerful, and highly recommended!",5,Best movie of the year!!!!,1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,2481,"['Walk', 'line', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'had', 'lot', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'managed', 'surpass', 'expectations', 'first', 'hearing', 'was', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'biopic', 'film', 'starring', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'much', 'thought', ""'re"", 'just', 'trying', 'cash', 'popularity', 'Ray', 'last', 'year', 'actors', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'picture', 'Phoenix', 'Witherspoon', 'doing', 'justice', 'Johnny', 'June', 'are', 'fine', 'actors', 'really', 'special', 'talent', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'risky', 'portraying', 'country', 'music', 'such', 'Cash', 'Carter', 'Then', 'heard', 'Walk', 'line', 'got', 'good', 'reviews', 'number', 'critics', 'friends', 'who', 'saw', 'also', 'spoke', 'very', 'highly', 'seeing', 'yesterday', 'consider', 'best', 'movie', 'year', 'worthy', 'oscar', 'nominations.The', 'story', 'mainly', 'Johnny', 'June', 'Carter', 'are', 'alot', 'similarities', 'film', 'Ray', 'main', 'difference', 'complexity', 'relationship', 'June', 'shown', 'more', 'here', 'saving', 'grace', 'Ray', 'wife', 'was', 'director', 'focus', 'give', 'insight', 'how', 'songs', 'were', 'written', 'Cash', 'Carter', 'interesting', 'hearing', 'Cash', 'Carter', 'songs', 'so', 'long', 'finally', 'see', 'circumstances', 'surrounding', 'lives', 'inspired', 'them.Phoenix', 'Witherspoon', 'give', 'performance', 'careers', 'voices', 'are', 'amazingly', 'accurate', 'originals', 'Phoenix', 'managing', 'hit', 'right', 'notes', 'suprisingly', 'almost', 'perfect', 'timbre', 'Witherspoon', 'sings', 'well', 'even', 'Carter-ish', 'growl', 'chemistry', 'two', 'posess', 'eachother', 'easy', 'audience', 'believe', 'Johnny', 'love', 'June', 'as', 'well', 'June', 'reluctance', 'marry', 'Johnny', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'deserve', 'nomination', 'best', 'actor', 'actress', 'nail', 'respective', 'parts', 'two', 'think', 'Phoenix', 'more', 'likely', 'win', 'oscar', 'portrayal', 'Johnny', 'so', 'beleivable', 'Johnny', 'vulnerability', 'wild', 'side', 'are', 'portrayed', 'ease', 'Phoenix', 'Phoenix', 'talent', 'giving', 'deep', 'probing', 'characters', 'emotional', 'side', 'not', 'only', 'channel', 'Cash', 'never', 'once', 'audience', 'look', 'not', 'think', 'Cash', 'Kudos', 'rest', 'cast', 'Witherspoon', 'Phoenix', 'really', 'make', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'writers', 'director', 'James', 'Mangold', 'Walk', 'line', 'touching', 'powerful', 'highly', 'recommended']",Walk the Line

Although it turns out that his life is just the same as every other rock star whose life gets the Hollywood Biopic treatment.About this time last year I saw ""Ray"", and the similarities between the two movies are numerous. Both Ray Charles and Johnny Cash are haunted by the death of a brother in childhood. Both struggle against the odds to become hit musicians. Both get mixed up in drugs, and have tumultuous love lives. Both get busted by the police at one point for their drugs. Both eventually get cleaned up with help from their woman.The similarity of the source material cannot, I suppose, be helped, but I think Hollywood is still guilty of trying to apply the cookie cutter mold to the rock star biopic. Or really any Hollywood biopic. The scene where the husband and wife are shouting in the kitchen and the wife starts crying has got to be in just about every biopic I have ever seen.Still, I did learn an interesting thing or do from this movie.

He did an amazing job capturing the personae and the sound of the late Mr. Cash. While I like Reese Witherspoon in the Legally Blonde series to me she looks like a high school girl who likes to play dress-up in all of her films and this one was no exception. Johnny Cash was complex and driven by many demons as this film shows.

637476,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B00005JO1R,Kaya Savas,"[4, 5]","MOVIE: James Mangold takes us into the formulaic yet satisfying life of the great Johnny Cash. Like all biopics, we have the protagonist who has had a troubled past and overcomes his inner demons to finally get his life back on track. It's pretty much the same senerio for every musical artist. Joaquin Phoenix gives one helluva performance as Cash, and he does it with his eyes. During the musical scenes when Pheonix is performing, you can't help but just stare into his eyes that give off the emotional state that he is singing in. The film is told as a flashback, and we start in Cash's childhood where he suffers the loss of his brother in a tragic accident. His father screams out loud that the devil took the wrong son, and that fuels the troubled past that haunts Cash as an adult. We've all heard the story before, whether it be Cash's story or any other singer/songwriter's. He gets his big break and makes a record, starts touring, falls in love with the lovely Reese Witherspoon who playes June Carter to perfection, uses drugs and alcohol to ease the pain of his past, conquers his problems, and comes to accept life and starts to live it. While it may seem formulaic, the film itself is a fascinating and emotional watch. It's very much like this year's Cinerella Man, a film that is totally formulaic but still brilliantly executed. Mangold, while he has no visual style, does provide a consistent direction for the film that doesn't lose the focus of the audience. The musical scenes are breathtaking and it's all thanks to the brilliant acting. What is even more impressive is that no V/O work was done. Phoenix and Witherspoon did all their own singing, which always adds to the authenticity. The film is a great experience for movie goers, and you'll probably find yourself with a few Johnny Cash tunes on your ipod afterwards.ACTING: Oscar nods for both Phoenix and Witherspoon are going to happen, the performances were absolutly stunning and just incredibly amazing, did I mention the acting was good? Phoenix won't win the Oscar for this one though, I just don't see the Academy giving it to Foxx for Ray last year and now for another musical biopic. Golden Globe? Definately not out of the question.BOTTOM LINE: A story we've all heard before, but it always feels fresh when it's done well. In this case it was done extremely well, the movie was great.",5,"A Formulaic Film, But The Acting Is Superb.

Though I am sure there are some parts of Cash's life that weren't focused on ( didn't he actually go to jail on one point?) I felt that the showing his of his undying love for June and his addiction to pills/alcohol was excellently portrayed. Also the tragic death of his older brother Jack, I found heartwrenching.  The acting is great, the two actors really did a great job at singing and performing Cash/Carter's classic songs.  What I loved is that they didn't try and make Cash/Carter seem perfect and their ""love story"" effortless and easy.  June is married/divorced a couple times and you see her take insults for it and how weary it makes her to love/marry Cash.  The only thing I wonder is how was Cash's first wife Viv portrayed and who did they get the information from.  Viv seemed very selfish and unsupportive and I was curious if this is how she actually was all the time, somehow I doubt it.  Still the movie really is about June and John, loving eachother and being best friends and finally overcoming everything.  It breaks my heart that John died only four months after June passed away.  Maybe you can die from a broken heart.

637480,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00005JO1R,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[1, 1]","""Walk The Line"" is supposed to be about the ups and downs of one John R. Cash, but in actuality, it's three stories in one.  The first story is that of Johnny Cash, who grew up in Arkansas a poor farmer's son.  His father was hard on him and even cruel when Johnny's older brother passes in an accident.  As Johnny gets older, he pursues a career in music.  His first big break comes at the hands of none other than Sam Phillips.  You know him for his many acts which include the King, the Killer, and the Man In Black (Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Johnny Cash, respectively), among others.  Cash begins to become very successful and slowly spins out in a self-inflicted chaos of sex, drugs, and rockabilly.The second story is that of June Carter, the ""other"" woman in Johnny Cash's life.  They befriend each other innocently enough, but as they spend more time on the road together, both of their marriages fall apart.  Cash's wife, Vivian, becomes very guarding of her children (and rightfully so), and Carter tries hard not only to save the life of Cash, but also to fight off her urges to love him.The third story, and my personal favorite, is that of the music created by Cash and Carter.  Their duets are amazing, and they reverberate throughout this biopic.  My personal favorite is ""Jackson,"" but none of the songs in this flick are to be missed.Overall, this is a wonderful biopic to watch.  I'd have given it five stars if it weren't for the fact that the music takes such a precedence in this movie, that we are only given a brief glimpse into the torrid life of Cash.  If you're not a fan of Cash's music, you may find yourself bored during the long scenes on tour.  I personally enjoyed them, but my wife just couldn't take it.The cast is wonderful.  Joaquin Phoenix is almost eerie in his presentation of Cash.  Reese Witherspoon is a spitfire as June Carter Cash.  She delivers one of the best performances of her career in this flick.  Ginnifer Goodwin plays Vivian Cash, Johnny's first wife, with tears almost permanently fixed into her eyes.  Robert Patrick and Shelby Lynne play Cash's parents, and do a wonderful job of it.  Sam Phillips and his bunch are also gamely represented here.I highly recommend this flick to fans of Cash or of Country and Rockabilly music in general.  Cash's music is legendary, and so is he, but let us not forget that behind every good man is a good woman (in this case, two good women).  Vivian was there in the beginning, when Johnny was starting on his downward spiral.  June literally saved him from falling into nothingness, and both of these women deserve as much credit for Cash's iconic status as he or anyone else does.An excellent film.",4,Three Stories Unfold,1159228800,"09 26, 2006",2006,2702,"['Walk', 'Line', 'supposed', 'be', 'ups', 'downs', 'one', 'John', 'R.', 'Cash', 'actuality', 'three', 'stories', 'one', 'first', 'story', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Arkansas', 'poor', 'farmer', 'son', 'father', 'was', 'hard', 'even', 'cruel', 'when', 'Johnny', 'older', 'brother', 'passes', 'accident', 'Johnny', 'older', 'career', 'music', 'first', 'big', 'break', 'hands', 'none', 'other', 'Sam', 'Phillips', 'know', 'many', 'acts', 'include', 'King', 'Killer', 'Man', 'Black', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'respectively', 'others', 'Cash', 'become', 'very', 'successful', 'slowly', 'out', 'self-inflicted', 'chaos', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rockabilly.The', 'second', 'story', 'June', 'Carter', 'other', 'woman', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'life', 'befriend', 'other', 'innocently', 'enough', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'road', 'together', 'marriages', 'fall', 'apart', 'Cash', 'wife', 'Vivian', 'very', 'guarding', 'children', 'rightfully', 'so', 'Carter', 'tries', 'hard', 'not', 'only', 'save', 'life', 'Cash', 'also', 'fight', 'off', 'urges', 'love', 'him.The', 'third', 'story', 'personal', 'favorite', 'music', 'created', 'Cash', 'Carter', 'duets', 'are', 'amazing', 'reverberate', 'biopic', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Jackson', 'none', 'songs', 'flick', 'are', 'be', 'missed.Overall', 'wonderful', 'biopic', 'watch', ""'d"", 'have', 'given', 'five', 'stars', 'were', ""n't"", 'fact', 'music', 'precedence', 'movie', 'are', 'only', 'given', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'torrid', 'life', 'Cash', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'Cash', 'music', 'may', 'find', 'bored', 'long', 'scenes', 'tour', 'personally', 'enjoyed', 'wife', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'it.The', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'almost', 'eerie', 'presentation', 'Cash', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'spitfire', 'June', 'Carter', 'Cash', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'flick', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'Vivian', 'Cash', 'Johnny', 'first', 'wife', 'tears', 'almost', 'permanently', 'fixed', 'eyes', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Shelby', 'Lynne', 'play', 'Cash', 'parents', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Sam', 'Phillips', 'bunch', 'are', 'also', 'gamely', 'represented', 'here.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'flick', 'fans', 'Cash', 'Country', 'Rockabilly', 'music', 'general', 'Cash', 'music', 'legendary', 'so', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'good', 'man', 'good', 'woman', 'case', 'two', 'good', 'women', 'Vivian', 'was', 'there', 'beginning', 'when', 'Johnny', 'was', 'starting', 'downward', 'spiral', 'June', 'literally', 'saved', 'falling', 'nothingness', 'women', 'deserve', 'much', 'credit', 'Cash', 'iconic', 'status', 'anyone', 'else', 'does.An', 'excellent', 'film']",Walk the Line
637481,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JO1R,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[4, 4]","Walk the Line tells a biographical account of Johnny Cash's (Joaquin Phoenix) life up to the mid-point of his life.  However, it does not focus on his musical achievements during this time although they are a major part of his life.  Instead, the film efficiently displays the maturation of his character. In the process, the audience gets a poignant glimpse into the roots and soul of his music.  The film opens in Folsom Prison in 1968, as Johnny fingers a circle saw while thinking of his childhood.  In one long flashback, the film provides a uniquely inspiring and genuinely moving picture of his agonizing life and constant search for something better.[Potential Spoilers Ahead For Viewers Unaware of Johnny Cash's Life]Even though people are the sum of their experiences, there are defining moments that shape our character and persona. Johnny Cash had several defining moments that helped form his identity, which had the possibility to strengthen, or destroy him.  Walk the Line offers an opportunity for the audience to see how he responded on these moments.  It also displays the importance that other people have on an individual's existence, as Johnny would not have succeeded, or overcome his predicaments without the love and care of others.Johnny Cash's life was everything, but easy, to which his songs are a testament.  Early on Johnny suffered the loss of his older brother, a death his father blamed on him.  He had a love hate relationship with his father, as he continuously sought his father's love by trying to please him.  However, every attempt was met with a put down.  The absence of his supportive and encouraging older brother left a large rift in his life, as it also continued to haunt him with agonizing guilt.  Besides the guilt, Johnny had to endure emotional neglect and abuse from his father who projected his own shortcomings onto him, which did not only continue to foster guilt, but also poor self-esteem and more anxiety.In the small home, where Johnny grew up he could not escape his father's physical presence, but he sought emotional refuge in music.  The radio and his mother's soothing singing offered him in moments of unease a chance to escape in spirit and mind.  Eventually, he came of age to leave home and a not a day too late he joined the Air Force.  Johnny ended up stationed in Germany during the Korean War for which his father also ridiculed him, as he did not fight the war like other real men.  The cut downs did not cease in Johnny's adulthood.  His father upheld the same loveless relationship with Johnny.Being an outsider, Johnny did not really fit in the military lifestyle. Again, he sought refuge in music, as a cure to his solitude. He acquired a guitar and taught himself how to handle the instrument. Soon he began to write his own material reflecting on the environment around him while letting his feelings steer his pen and fingers over the guitar strings. It is in this cerebral state where Johnny discovered peace and joy, but it also began the sanctuary where Johnny could exorcise some of his personal demons.Despite Johnny beginning to feel freer through music, he still hampered his own growth by trying to please others such as a future father-in-law and his father.  For example, his marriage to Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), doomed from the beginning, displays his noble attempt to please others while in the process slowly killing the joy within him.  Not that Vivian was a bad person, but they were not right for each other as Johnny merely tried to make everyone else happy.  The desire to make others like him ran deep within Johnny, who acquired this personal trait in a young age by constantly trying to prove himself worthy of his father's affection.Thus, it is easy to see how Johnny fell in love with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) in their first encounter.  The upbeat beauty had a wondrous voice and a great sense of humor that brought about laughter, which must have been something Johnny dearly must have lacked during his upbringing.  She did not judge him, but shared her willingness to appreciate him and his music. June made him feel alive, worthy, and free of judgment.  Yet, Johnny could not enter her life, as he was married and she has recently got out of a bad divorce.Despite the distance between Johnny and June, he continued to long for her.  With the years his affection only grew stronger, until he came to a crossroads of pain where he once again was forced to face his demons.  Alone, he sought alternative ways of tranquilizing the agony within through a heavy drug addiction, which began harmlessly while partying with the other great musicians such as Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton) and Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne).  The drugs affected him to the point where he no longer could interact or perform with others.The many experiences and life defining moments in Johnny's life show a scarred battling fighter trying to overcome his excruciating past with love and music.  The black outfit serves a fitting symbolical value to Johnny, as a reminder of his past transgressions.  It is also here that Johnny Cash's greatness rests, as he does not pretend to be someone else.  He sings about the daily struggles that many suffer.  It provides something that people can relate to, but also find that they are not alone.  Thus, before a performance when Johnny Cash said with his unique voice, ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.""  It convincingly echoed within each listener - his is one of us.There are several aspects of Walk the Line that make it a brilliant film.  First of all, James Mangold is the perfect director for the film, as his profound understanding of human psychology only seems to improve, which also heavily influenced his previous films Girl, Interrupted (1999) and Identity (2003).  Several of the actors provide solid performances, especially Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix in the leads.  However, the supporting cast also helps bring out the emotional qualities in the main characters.  One must naturally also include the music, which is superb throughout the film.  Ultimately, these and other aspects of the cinematic process deliver remarkable cinematic experiences that will not fade in memory.",5,A Poignant Glimpse Into the Roots and Soul of Johnny Cash's Music

The movie in a sense is a great bio-music pic... much like ""Ray"" or ""Beyond The Sea"". But, this movie will not just make fans of Johnny Cash but will appeal to, all movie-goers . The story focuses mainly on the love affair Cash had with June Carter rather than a 'bunch of facts' that relate to Cash's life.The love affair with Cash is not only interesting but, it is relatable and unbelievable sweet. Reese Witherspoon got a well-deserved Oscar for her performance- she gives perhaps the most honest portrayal ever done on June Carter Cash- a smart, intelligent, family orriented women- (which Reese also is).Phoenix looks the part- but in this movie he actually acts the part too- and deserved an Oscar for his performance. The performance is so authentic it is hard to seperate the man from the legend- and the actor from the man. He is GREAT and gives the PERFORMANCE that Cash himself would be proud of.What is even more amazing is the music-both actors sing their songs and REALLY well- the music fits in well with the period and done in chroniological order that makes sense- unlike most bio-music pics.The movie is definately one of the movies that is ""must see"" the movie is heartwarming, heart-breaking,and amazingly humorous at times...like when Johnny is a rut financially, loses his car, and is on drugs- he walks for miles to June Carter's house a ritual he calls his ""June Carter love walk.""

637483,A2GPEV42IO41CI,B00005JO1R,Kona,"[6, 7]","Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give impressive performances in this story of Johnny Cash and his long-time  love, June Carter.  Johnny grew up poor on a cotton farm, listening to June Carter and her family sing on the radio.  He married a girl from home, worked as a door-to-door salesman, and started singing, but his wife was jealous of Johnny's career and his time away from home.  He met June and was smitten, but they were both married; they continued to tour together for years, through June's second marriage and Johnny's terrible drug abuse.  June helped him kick his habit and later, Johnny proposed to her onstage.I really enjoyed the songs in the movie a lot; I was especially impressed that Phoenix and Witherspoon did their own singing and playing and made it look so easy.  Phoenix's Johnny is a tortured and self-destructive soul, and Witherspoon's June is spunky, kind, and mature. This is surely the best movie for both of them to date.  They have great romantic chemistry on-screen and their close-ups are intense! The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, especially Robert Patrick as Johnny's mean and unrepentant father.  I heartily recommend ""Walk the Line;"" it is an emotional roller-coaster of highs and lows, with a lot of entertaining music and two very likeable stars.Kona",5,"""Y'all can't walk no line.""",1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,1308,"['Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'give', 'impressive', 'performances', 'story', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'long-time', 'love', 'June', 'Carter', 'Johnny', 'grew', 'up', 'poor', 'cotton', 'farm', 'listening', 'June', 'Carter', 'family', 'sing', 'radio', 'married', 'girl', 'home', 'worked', 'door-to-door', 'salesman', 'started', 'singing', 'wife', 'was', 'jealous', 'Johnny', 'career', 'time', 'away', 'home', 'met', 'June', 'was', 'smitten', 'were', 'married', 'continued', 'tour', 'together', 'years', 'June', 'second', 'marriage', 'Johnny', 'terrible', 'drug', 'abuse', 'June', 'helped', 'kick', 'habit', 'later', 'Johnny', 'proposed', 'onstage.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'songs', 'movie', 'lot', 'was', 'especially', 'impressed', 'Phoenix', 'Witherspoon', 'did', 'own', 'singing', 'playing', 'made', 'look', 'so', 'easy', 'Phoenix', 'Johnny', 'tortured', 'self-destructive', 'soul', 'Witherspoon', 'June', 'spunky', 'kind', 'mature', 'surely', 'best', 'movie', 'date', 'have', 'great', 'romantic', 'chemistry', 'on-screen', 'close-ups', 'are', 'intense', 'supporting', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Johnny', 'mean', 'unrepentant', 'father', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'Walk', 'Line', 'emotional', 'roller-coaster', 'highs', 'lows', 'lot', 'entertaining', 'music', 'two', 'very', 'likeable', 'stars.Kona']",Walk the Line

I have read two biographies of his life, and purchased this film to see if the visual is as accurate as the written biography.  I am pleased to say that this film is a reliable reproduction of the life of Johnny and June (Carter) Cash.And what a wonderfully entertaining film this is!  I am keeping this one for my collection, and very few films make my collection - only those I want to see again (and again).  The acting performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are Oscar worthy and perhaps the best work either has ever done.  Phoenix becomes Johnny Cash, and we learn what a tortured man he was, and how June's love helped Johnny find peace and contentment.  Witherspoon becomes June Carter, down to her lovely voice and vivacious and energetic spirit.The songs are absolutely wonderful.  While they cannot compare to the originals by Johnny and June, they hold their own quite nicely.

Starting out from Arkansas as a ne'er do well, Cash does a brief stint in the Air Force and works as a door-to-door salesman before taking his amateur band into Nashville's legendary Sun Records to take his first steps on the road to stardom.Playing in a succession of honky-tonks, school gyms, and other seedy venues, Cash hones his craft on endless and huge road tours in the company of such other rising stars as Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, and Elvis Presley. His growing popularity with his female fans puts breaking strains on his marriage. Along the way, he meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) of the famous Carter family. The two begin a tempestuous on-again off-again relationship that is punctuated by Johnny's bouts of heavy drinking, amphetamine abuse and womanizing, as well as June's emotional travail at being an absent twice-divorced mother of two young girls.Witherspoon, known for her fluffy comedies, won the Best Actress Oscar for devouring the scenery as the deep, emotionally complex, feisty but firm June Carter, who refuses Cash's constant entreaties to marry him, argues him into responsibility, drops him when his behavior goes over the line, and is there absolutely as Johnny battles his demons, kicks the amphetamines, and at last confronts his vicious father. Cash finally walks the line, mostly because of Carter. More than lovers, the two are best friends.Although Phoenix did not win Best Actor for Cash, his performance is on a par with Witherspoon's. Starting out a bit tentatively, Phoenix's portrayal of Cash gains freight-train momentum as the film progresses, until at the end, Phoenix becomes Johnny Cash. His concert at Folsom Prison is electrifying and profoundly real.Witherspoon and Phoenix sing the songs, and do it amazingly well. Their performance reaches its crescendo at the close of the film, when Johnny proposes (for the seventieth time) to June onstage in Ontario, and she at last says yes.Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash remained married from 1968 until their deaths, weeks apart, in 2003.

I had read Johnny Cash's autobiography and been a fan of his music for years and like others wondered if this film would do his remarkable life justice. I think it does. Joaquin Phoenix does a phenomenal job of portraying Johnny's highs and lows, and Reese Witherspoon absolutely becomes June Carter Cash. I was really happy with the flow of the movie, it did not dwell a lot on the early years his life as the son of a poor sharecropper, but you could tell that he always felt a guilt about the incident that killed his brother at a young age and that (I don't think) he ever thought he got the 'approval' he wanted from his father. Cash certainly had some demons, I think some scenes were not as gritty as they could have been, especially some of his episodes while on drugs, but producers probably did not want to risk getting an 'R' rating.

What most distinguishes this biopic is the wonderful singing of the two leads, who do their own voicing for their parts. Phoenix is remarkable as Cash and Witherspoon somewhat less so as Carter Cash.The movies takes us from Cash's early boyhood, where his father chides God for taking the wrong son when John's brother dies, through his drug addicted adulthood and failed first marriage, up to the point where he and Carter tied the knot in 1968. They lived together 35 years and died within a few months of each other in 2003.The movie also includes characterizations of Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley, both of whom apparently came of age in the Memphis music scene with Cash and Carter. The film effectively portrays the rigors of the music business in the 1950s with its night after night stops, groupies, bus travel, drinking, drugs and partying, and the way this wears down people and relationships (both Cash and Carter had failed marriages related to their music lifestyles.)For me, the best part of this picture is the singing. It is universally effective in a toe tapping mood. The movie would have been about half as good without the music. In this regard, Witherspoon was much better here than in ""Vanity Fair"", where her singing of 1800 music was consistently behind the beat and off-key. Phoenix was a near double for Cash, a fellow that was easy to mimic.",4,"Best biopic since ""Kinsey""",1160265600,"10 8, 2006",2006,1679,"['best', 'big', 'budget', 'big', 'screen', 'biopic', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Kinsey', 'film', 'tried', 'define', 'lead', 'character', 'poor', 'relationship', 'had', 'father.In', 'Line', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'rock-country', 'superstar', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'wife', 'June', 'Carter', 'Cash', 'What', 'most', 'distinguishes', 'biopic', 'wonderful', 'singing', 'two', 'leads', 'who', 'do', 'own', 'voicing', 'parts', 'Phoenix', 'remarkable', 'Cash', 'Witherspoon', 'somewhat', 'less', 'so', 'Carter', 'Cash.The', 'movies', 'Cash', 'early', 'boyhood', 'where', 'father', 'chides', 'God', 'taking', 'wrong', 'son', 'when', 'John', 'brother', 'dies', 'drug', 'addicted', 'adulthood', 'failed', 'first', 'marriage', 'up', 'point', 'where', 'Carter', 'tied', 'knot', '1968', 'lived', 'together', '35', 'years', 'died', 'few', 'months', 'other', '2003.The', 'movie', 'also', 'characterizations', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'whom', 'apparently', 'came', 'age', 'Memphis', 'music', 'scene', 'Cash', 'Carter', 'film', 'effectively', 'rigors', 'music', 'business', '1950s', 'night', 'night', 'stops', 'groupies', 'bus', 'travel', 'drinking', 'drugs', 'partying', 'way', 'down', 'people', 'relationships', 'Cash', 'Carter', 'had', 'failed', 'marriages', 'related', 'music', 'lifestyles', 'best', 'part', 'picture', 'singing', 'universally', 'effective', 'toe', 'tapping', 'mood', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'about', 'half', 'good', 'music', 'regard', 'Witherspoon', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'here', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'where', 'singing', '1800', 'music', 'was', 'consistently', 'beat', 'off-key', 'Phoenix', 'was', 'near', 'double', 'Cash', 'fellow', 'was', 'easy', 'mimic']",Walk the Line
637496,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B00005JO1R,L.A. Scene,"[0, 0]","In a time where Hollywood is basically enamored with making ""remake"" movies, it is good to see Hollywood do something original for a change.  This even applies if the movie is a based on an autobiography.  ""Walk the Line"" is a movie that has its screenplay based on Johnny Cash's autobiography (and is also named for one of his hit songs, ""I Walk the Line"").  I must admit, up until the point I saw ""Walk the Line"", I couldn't claim to be a Johnny Cash fan.  However, after watching the movie, ""Walk the Line"" not only did I watch what I considered to be one of the best movies I have seen in a while, but it did give me a new appreciation for Johnny Cash's career.  This is a movie that will hold your interest from start to finish and will entertain you throughout.  Much of the reason for why this movie ""grabs you"" is because of the incredibly strong performance of Joaquin Phoenix.While ""Walk the Line"" is a movie that covers the autobiography of Johnny Cash, much of the film focuses around his relationship with June Carter - who would eventually become Cash's longtime wife.  The movie follows the first 35 years of Cash's life as well as Cash's battle with drug addiction.  The movie takes us back to Cash's boyhood days where we can get some background of his childhood.  We learn how a family tragedy that occurred as a boy would have an impact on Cash for the rest of his life.  After Cash joins the Air Force, he meets his first wife Vivian (played by Ginnifer Goodwin).  After they have their first child Roseanne, we see how Cash formed a band and got his first record audition.  Following the release of their first record, Cash finds success and soon begins to hit the road touring with some of Rock and Roll's early legends.  During this time touring, Cash meets Carter and soon begins a longtime friendship and attraction to her.  The touring soon begins to strain his marriage to Vivian and eventually will lead Cash to the beginnings of his drug addiction.  The drug addiction will soon impact all aspects of Cash's life - his marriage to Vivian,  his relationship with Carter, and even his career.  The film even documents Cash's famous drug bust at the El Paso-Mexico border.  Cash's marriage to Vivian eventually falls apart.  However, the drug addiction continues.  Eventually, it will be June who will play a role in cleaning up Cash - and eventually will eventually become his wife.  The film will also highlight how Cash ended up doing his legendary performance (and recording) at Folsom Prison.The one thing I learned about this movie was the relationship that Cash had with the early pioneers of Rock and Roll.  In particular, we see Cash touring with Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Elvis Presley.  This is something I never knew about.  The performance of Jerry Lee Lewis by actor Waylon Payne was excellent.  Although Payne's part wasn't a major part of the movie, Payne still provided the brashness needed to play Lewis - making for some very entertaining scenes.There aren't many negatives about the movie, but there are two things that I feel are worth mentioning.  While the movie does a great job at chronicling the relationship between Cash and Carter, it doesn't do as good a job showing how the relationship between Cash and his first wife Vivian disintegrated.  While it is clear the drug addiction and infatuation with Carter had something to do with it, we don't seen enough dialogue between Cash and his first wife Vivian as their marriage began to fall apart.  The other negative is that it doesn't focus on Cash's later years - we don't see his relapse into drug addiction (that occurred in the 1980s) and we don't see his later projects (such as when he joined the supergroup - ""The Highwaymen"").However, it is going to be the performance of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon as Johnny Cash and June Carter respectively that are really going to be the story of this film.  It is well documented that Cash and Carter (who both would pass away before the film was released), gave their blessings for Phoenix and Witherspoon to take on these roles.  It is clear that they both were perfect fits for this role.  While Witherspoon would garner the most acclaim for her Academy Award Winning performance of Carter (and while I'm not an awards expert, I feel this was warranted), I really felt it was Phoenix's performance that was the stronger of the two.  It is clear that not only Phoenix studied the part of Johnny Cash in depth, but would also completely master the part.  This mastery would reflect on the screen.  In each and every scene that Phoenix is in (which is most of the movie), you see how Phoenix had command of the character.  With all due respect to a legendary performer like Johnny Cash, I actually believed that Phoenix was Cash.  Another point worth noting is that Phoenix and Witherspoon did their own singing throughout the movie.  Not only did Phoenix master the character of Johnny Cash, but he would also do an outstanding job at doing Cash's vocals.  Witherspoon deserves a lot of credit too - she did a great job with the vocals as well.  Most importantly though, Phoenix and Witherspoon clearly had on-screen chemistry - and this was very important because the dynamics between Carter and Cash are the core of this movie.This movie was about 2 hours and 15 minutes.  Some may consider this a ""long film"", but there is not one part of this movie where I lost interest.  You don't have to be a country music or a Johnny Cash fan to enjoy this movie - because this is simply an outstanding story to follow.  This movie is highly recommended.",5,Joaquin Phoenix  Delivers An All-Time Performance,1161475200,"10 22, 2006",2006,5630,"['time', 'where', 'Hollywood', 'basically', 'enamored', 'making', 'remake',

That is because it is clear from the start of this 2005 bio-pic that this is the love story of Johnny (Joaquin Phoenix) and June (Reese Witherspoon).  In the last act of the film my wife expressed surprise that the couple were not married yet and I told her that this film was going to be over as soon as she finally said ""yes.""  I was close on that score, because the film includes an important grace note and fade out that says it all.  But even if you knew nothing about their legendary love it would be clear from the opening scenes of this movie when a young J.R. Cash and his brother Jack are listening to young June Carter singing on the radio.What I liked about ""Walk the Line"" was that even knowing the key threads of the story, all of which are cinematic commonplaces, the screenplay by writer Gill Dennis and director James Mangold delivers memorable scenes.  One thread is how Cash became the Man in Black, and when he blows his audition in front of Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts), the legendary head of Sun Records in Memphis gives him a slim second chance with a dead on speech as to how Cash needs to be singing songs.  Cash happens to have been inspired by a film about a prison in California to write a song, and he starts to sing it and changes before our eyes and ears.  Cash and his father, Ray (Robert Patrick), have been at odds since a childhood tragedy and we wait for the moment when the son will finally tell the father off.  But when it comes Cash is still living in a glass house and the tables do not get turned.""Walk the Line"" saves the best for last.  The famous concert at Folsom Prison is the first of two significant payoffs, as it represents Cash finally embodying his songs and not simply singing them.  The connection between Cash and his audience changed then and he finally became a man.  But that was not enough for June who has been refusing all of his proposals.  When his family could do nothing to save Cash from his drug addiction, it is June and her family who step in, however she makes it clear that she will sing with him but she will not marry him.  Now, most of us remember the lady as June Carter Cash, so we know that she is going to say yes.  What is important is that it clearly will take something special for her to consent, and this film comes up with a moment worthy of their relationship and out anticipation.Phoenix and Witherspoon do their own singing and what is key is not that they imitate Johnny and June but that they capture their hearts, which is a good thing in a romance, even when it also happens to be a bio-pic.  During the final credits we finally hear the real Johnny and June singing as they take their curtain call.  But when their voices fade away and we return to the plaintive guitar pickin' of T-Bone Burnett our thoughts return to Lynne's lovely elegy:""Now were starting over it's the place that we areYou look more than pretty underneath all the starsLove, love is a burning thingOh how I still love to hear you singAnd everything we ever heard about heaven is trueToday's the day that Johnny met JuneToday's the day that Johnny met June.""",5,The love story of Johnny Cash and June Carter,1137369600,"01 16, 2006",2006,3549,"['Hey', 'darlin', 'hey', 'sweetI', ""'ve"", 'waited', 'day', 'knew', 'would', 'meet.Hey', 'sun', 'hey', 'moonToday', 'day', 'thatJohnny', 'met', 'June', 'know', 'Shelby', 'Lynne', 'wrote', 'Johnny', 'met', 'June', 'death', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'four', 'months', 'passing', 'June', 'Carter', 'Cash', 'was', 'impossible', 'not', 'think', 'song', 'watching', 'Walk', 'Line', 'even', 'realized', 'Lynne', 'was', 'playing', 'Cash', 'mother', 'Carrie', 'clear', 'start', '2005', 'bio-pic', 'love', 'story', 'Johnny', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'June', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'last', 'act', 'film', 'wife', 'expressed', 'surprise', 'couple', 'were', 'not', 'married', 'yet', 'told', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'over', 'as', 'soon', 'finally', 'said', 'yes', 'was', 'close', 'score', 'film', 'important', 'grace', 'note', 'fade', 'out', 'even', 'knew', 'nothing', 'legendary', 'love', 'would', 'be', 'clear', 'opening', 'scenes', 'movie', 'when', 'young', 'J.R.', 'Cash', 'brother', 'Jack', 'are', 'listening', 'young', 'June', 'Carter', 'singing', 'radio.What', 'liked', 'Walk', 'Line', 'was', 'even', 'knowing', 'key', 'threads', 'story', 'are', 'cinematic', 'commonplaces', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'Gill', 'Dennis', 'director', 'James', 'Mangold', 'delivers', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'One', 'thread', 'how', 'Cash', 'became', 'Man', 'Black', 'when', 'audition', 'front', 'Sam', 'Phillips', 'Dallas', 'Roberts', 'legendary', 'head', 'Sun', 'Records', 'Memphis', 'slim', 'second', 'chance', 'dead', 'speech', 'how', 'Cash', 'be', 'singing', 'songs', 'Cash', 'have', 'been', 'inspired', 'film', 'prison', 'California', 'write', 'song', 'sing', 'changes', 'eyes', 'ears', 'Cash', 'father', 'Ray', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'have', 'been', 'odds', 'childhood', 'tragedy', 'wait', 'moment', 'when', 'son', 'will', 'finally', 'tell', 'father', 'off', 'when', 'Cash', 'still', 'living', 'glass', 'house', 'tables', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'turned', 'Walk', 'Line', 'best', 'last', 'famous', 'concert', 'Folsom', 'Prison', 'first', 'two', 'significant', 'payoffs', 'Cash', 'finally', 'embodying', 'songs', 'not', 'simply', 'singing', 'connection', 'Cash', 'audience', 'changed', 'then', 'finally', 'became', 'man', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'June', 'who', 'been', 'refusing', 'proposals', 'When', 'family', 'could', 'do', 'nothing', 'save', 'Cash', 'drug', 'addiction', 'June', 'family', 'who', 'step', 'however', 'clear', 'will', 'sing', 'will', 'not', 'marry', 'Now', 'most', 'remember', 'lady', 'June', 'Carter', 'Cash', 'know', 'going', 'say', 'yes', 'What', 'important', 'clearly', 'will', 'take', 'something', 'special', 'consent', 'film', 'up', 'moment', 'worthy', 'relationship', 'anticipation.Phoenix', 'Witherspoon', 'do', 'own', 'singing', 'what', 'key', 'not', 'imitate', 'Johnny', 'June', 'capture', 'hearts', 'good', 'thing', 'romance', 'even', 'when', 'also', 'be', 'bio-pic', 'final', 'credits', 'finally', 'hear', 'real', 'Johnny', 'June', 'singing', 'take', 'curtain', 'call', 'when', 'voices', 'fade', 'away', 'return', 'plaintive', 'guitar', 'pickin', 'T-Bone', 'Burnett', 'thoughts', 'return', 'Lynne', 'lovely', 'elegy', 'Now', 'were', 'starting', 'place', 'areYou', 'look', 'more', 'pretty', 'underneath', 'starsLove', 'love', 'burning', 'thingOh', 'how', 'still', 'love', 'hear', 'singAnd', 'everything', 'ever', 'heard', 'heaven', 'trueToday', 'day', 'Johnny', 'met', 'JuneToday', 'day', 'Johnny', 'met', 'June']",Walk the Line

Is the movie going to be a classic, or a pale copy of a pale copy?  There are no worries about this movie; it is a wonderful overview of Johnny Cash's life that hits the highlights and the feeling of his career without bogging down in excessive details.The movie fast forwards through Johnny Cash's early years, stopping briefly at incidents that had a profound effect on Cash in his adult life.  While little attention is given to details, a viewer quickly gets the sense of how Cash's life was affected by poverty, his brother's tragic accident, and his years in the Air Force.The movie really begins to take off in 1955.  Johnny tries to be several things that he clearly was not.  A chance encounter with a recording studio soon had Johnny launched on the perpetual touring circuit that was required in that era to popularize music.  Unfortunately, the constant touring was a strain on Cash and the temptations of touring, particularly alcohol, drugs and beautiful women, caused Cash's marriage and career to suffer.Moving in and out of Cash's life was June Carter.  June was the opposite of Cash - stable and level-headed.  Fortunate for Cash, who realized early in his career that he loved June Carter, June was always there when he needed her.  This movie ends with an overview of the latter part of Cash's career and marriage to June Carter Cash, again providing impressions and snapshots rather than excessive detail.Johnny Cash was, as many people are, and incredibly complicated person.  It would have been impossible to present the complexities of his life in any detail in two hours.  Director James Mangold went for impressions and key incidents, and we walk away feeling that we understand the person of Johnny Cash.  Mangold leaves lots of room for others who wish to fill in the vast detail of Cash's life, but Mangold has provided the outline and all the detail necessary for the critical early part of Cash's career.In addition to hitting only the highlights, which keeps the movie moving along briskly, the choice of actors was outstanding.  Joaquin Phoenix proves that his acting talents are as good as or better than those of his peers.  Reese Witherspoon proves that her acting talents have been underutilized in light comedy as she makes the role of June Carter Cash all her own.  Even more incredible, both actors sang the music you hear in the movie.  Considering particularly that Cash had a very unique voice, Phoenix was very brave in attempting the songs, and his outstanding effort helps make his role multi-dimensional.To further lend support for the quality of this movie, it received 26 awards, including an Oscar, and was nominated for another 20 awards.Hollywood seems fixated on glitzy special effects movies with mega-million dollar budgets and plots that exist only to support the special effects.  ""Walk the Line"" is a rare movie that reminds us all that Hollywood can still make a great movie that will appeal to those of us that like to hear stories of average people that became winners.  ""Walk the Line"" is one of the best movies of 2005, and is likely to be one of the best movies of the first decade of the new millennium.

She is a complete surprise, especially her singing, and she contributes as much as Phoenix to the film.I was a bit disappointed in the story, because it stuck pretty much to the musical bio style that Hollywood's been using for half a century.  It could have been about almost any music megastar. We learn a lot about Cash's domestic problems and his addictions, but we gain little insight into the shaping of the talent that allowed him to write and perform as powerfully as he did.

637530,AAY1YLTKK4JC7,B00005JO1R,"Martin Andrade ""Media Gurgitator""","[10, 20]","Hollywood has been making biopic (biographical) films since the beginning of films.  At first, the biographies were overly positive.  ""The Pride of the Yankees"", ""The Charles Lindberg Story,"" even the post WWII movie ""The Desert Fox"" focused more on the positive aspects of Erwin Rommel, a German Field Marshal.  Eventually the genre changed to try to provide a deeper understanding of the person.  ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is the classic example; in that movie the viewer was exposed not to just what T.E. Lawrence did, but who he was.Eventually these biopic films became much more honest, incorporating both the positive and the negative aspects of individuals.  This is fine; I don't want propaganda in biopic films.  It's fascinating to see the darker side of important figures.  It makes them much more real, and yet makes their accomplishments all the more spectacular.  The movie ""Ray"" epitomizes this balance.""Ray"" was one of the best movies of the decade.  The story of Ray Charles put to the silver screen.  Audiences got a healthy dose of music, an incredible performance by Jamie Foxx, and a fair picture of the life of Ray Charles, including the low points and the high points.""Walk the Line"" should be the same thing as ""Ray.""  It's a biography of a musical figure who had low points in his life.  But in execution, ""Walk the Line"" comes no where near the quality of ""Ray.""  Even in the genre of biographies this movie fails to live up to any standard.  Even if it were decided that Walk the Line should not be compared to ""Ray,"" it's still my conclusion that this film isn't worth the price of any admission.Joaquin Phoenix does a good job portraying the enigmatic singer Johnny Cash; Reese Witherspoon shows her abilities playing the part of June Carter.  The movie looks good, each scene has good direction.  But this movie lacks any kind of spirit.  It has an almost flat reception.  In fact, a major part of the story, the romance between June Carter and Johnny Cash, is absent.  There is no chemistry.  It's not a love story at all.  Carter and Cash appear only as close friends.The film focuses on ten years of Cash's life.  Ten dark years where Cash was ruled by an addiction to amphetamines and other drugs.  Ten years of strife with his first wife.  Ten years of adultery.  The movie hardly does justice to the life of Johnny Cash, it focuses more on the faults of Johnny Cash.  The goal of this movie was to destroy the memory of Johnny Cash.  It did not present a balanced view of the man's life.  It did not tell us of his origins.  There are few epiphanies.  The characters don't grow as people.  Cash is not presented as a deep character.  He's more or less portrayed as an antagonist.The man who was Johnny Cash is not present in this film.  The film does not portray his recovery from drugs.  In an act of pure ""Christo-phobia"" the movie fails to show Johnny Cash answering an alter-call.  The movie was designed to destroy the man.

He came just about as close as an actor could be expected to come.  Reese Witherspoon also does a very respectable job of carrying a tune in this movie.The life being chronicled in this movie is certainly an interesting one, yet it is certainly not a story we haven't seen before.  It bears countless similarities to other ""rock star"" movies we've all seen in the past.  They come from humble beginnings, take a chance and make it big, crumble under the pressure of the fame, turn to drugs and become dependant - and eventually get cleaned up by the few people who give a damn.

We get outstanding performances from Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. Look also for a strong showing by Ginnifer Goodwin as Johnny Cash's first wife, Vivian. Waylon Payne also acts well as Jerry Lee Lewis. The plot moves along nicely even though there is little time spent on Johnny's childhood and his stint in the military; and the cinematography is well done.When the film begins, we get a brief glimpse into the main themes that ran through Johnny's life when he was a very young boy growing up in the South. His father Ray Cash (Robert Patrick) was rather cold toward him and became even colder still when Johnny's younger brother Jack (Lucas Till) died after an accident with a chainsaw. After what seems to have been a brief period of time in the military, Johnny marries his sweetheart Vivian and tries to make ends meet as a door-to-door salesman. However, Johnny's efforts in sales just didn't work out--but when he and a couple of his buddies get a chance to record a record for Sun Records things finally begin to look bright for Johnny and his young family.Of course, complications ensue. Johnny spends time on the road--in fact, he spends a lot of time on the road and after he meets June Carter on the road his marriage to Vivian slowly but surely begins to crumble. Vivian tries hard to get Johnny to stay at home more and focus on his children; but Johnny never seems quite able to do that and after quite a few years they divorce.Johnny pursues June Carter even though she marries another man; and he never quite gets over his poor relationship with his father. After time, Johnny's addiction to amphetamines also takes a toll on his career.Will Johnny be able to finally convince June Carter to marry him? How does his relationship with Columbia Records go while he has all his personal problems? Just in case you're not familiar with the story of Johnny Cash, I'll leave these questions and more for you to find out as you watch this excellent flick.I certainly think the storyline should have continued after 1968; Johnny lived and did much more with his life and career between the years 1968 and 2003 when he passed away. However, the story is quite strong and the ending titles do give you a pretty good idea of what happened to Johnny and June Carter in general.The DVD comes with quite a few deleted scenes and there is an optional running commentary with co-writer and director James Mangold. Great!Johnny Cash fans will love this biopic which is rather good despite a minor flaw here and there. I was very impressed that Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon performed all of their songs without any dubbing! Johnny Cash was a good human being and an exceptionally talented man who deserves to have his life portrayed in a biopic. People who like biopics will also enjoy this film.

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[14, 14]","It could be said that ""Walk the line"" is a movie about the life of Johnny Cash, a very well-known American artist that overcame all kinds of difficulties to become famous and share his music with the public. However, it would be more accurate to point out that this film is centered both on Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), and the love they had for each other.The opening sequence is wonderful, and will make you realize that you weren`t wrong in choosing to watch ""Walk the line"". That feeling is likely to be specially strong if, like me, you don't really know a lot about Johnny Cash, and just want to watch a good and entertaining film. Notwithstanding that, you will also end up learning quite a few things about one of the most important American musicians of all time, and about a period in which many conventions were being broken by new artists.This film tells the spectator about Johnny Cash's childhood and his bad relationship with his father (played by Robert Patrick), his time in the Air Force, and the beginnings of his music career, when he met people like Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Malloy Payne), Elvis (Tyler Hilton), and the love of his life, singer June Carter. There was a big problem though: Cash was already married to another woman, Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), something that June didn't forget, and repeated to Johnny every time she rejected his attempts to go beyond a friendship.The scenes where Johnny struggles with his addiction to drugs and with depression are quite difficult to watch, probably due to the fact that Joaquin Phoenix delivers a splendid performance. Reese Witherspoon is also outstandingly good as June, the person that saves Johnny Cash from himself.All the same, I want to mention that ""Walk the line"" is not all about drama. There are funny moments too, and also some wonderful scenes recreating Johnny's concerts that allow you to listen to the real deal. Oh well, maybe not the real deal, because Phoenix and Witherspoon did their own singing, but their version of those concerts is an extremely good one. I am seriously thinking about buying not only a cd with Cash's more important songs, but also another with the soundtrack of this movie. Listening to Phoenix singing ""Folsom Prison Blues"" is no hardship!On the whole, I cannot recommend this movie strongly enough. It is not perfect, but it is the kind of movie that you simply must see and enjoy.

I had to actually put the subtitles on for Reese Witherspoon though, with a strong southern accent, I could not understand a word the girl was saying! The songs were could, toe tapping but forgettable - apart from ""Walk The Line"".My one quibble about Walk The Line, is the fact huge chunks of time were deemed not important enough to be included in the film, making the film seem almost jumpy. There is some stuff I would have dumped in order to see more of his early life, and most importantly, life after him & June finally got married & got together. After getting married, they were together 35 years, why not show some more of that?I have to applaud Reese, she did hold her own in the film, a role that could have been reduced to a few lines, a song, and more a redneck hick role.Elvis also appears in this, and although he's not in it for long, he really irritated me, as they could have chosen a better Elvis lookalike from all the thousands that there are out there! I have never seen a guy look less like Elvis ever.It does get slightly boring in parts, as I've said before, there are big jumps in time, and you feel like there's something in there that could have been shown, and the ending was a bit of a let down. But the film holds well, as do Reese & Joaquin's voices, but I'm still at a loss to why he was so popular.I keep a close watch on this heart of mineI keep my eyes wide open all the timeI keep the ends out for the tie that bindsBecause you're mine, I walk the lineI find it very, very easy to be trueI find myself alone when each day is throughYes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for youBecause you're mine, I walk the lineAs sure as night is dark and day is lightI keep you on my mind both day and nightAnd happiness I've known proves that it's rightBecause you're mine, I walk the lineYou've got a way to keep me on your sideYou give me cause for love that I can't hideFor you I know I'd even try to turn the tideBecause you're mine, I walk the line",3,Johnny Who?,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,2756,"['Prior', 'watching', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Apart', 'fact', ""'d"", 'died', 'someone', 'American', 'Idol', 'had', 'sang', 'Walk', 'Line', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'lyrics', 'reason', 'just', 'had', 'get', 'film', 'dad', 'asked', 'why', 'mum', 'asked', 'why', 'boyfriend', 'asked', 'why', 'had', 'really', 'good', 'answer', 'give', 'just', 'wanted', 'see', 'it.I', 'have', 'real', 'interest', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'either', 'Yes', 'like', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'film', ""n't"", 'apparently', 'really', 'well', 'suited', 'role', 'forget', 'actually', 'soon', 'enough', 'even', 'annoying', 'scar', 'cleft', 'palate', 'alright', 'voice.Both', 'actors', 'did', 'own', 'vocals', 'taking', 'six', 'months', 'vocal', 'training', 'learn', 'be', 'Johnny', 'June', 'Cash', 'had', 'actually', 'put', 'subtitles', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'strong', 'southern', 'accent', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'word', 'girl', 'was', 'saying', 'songs', 'were', 'could', 'toe', 'tapping', 'forgettable', 'apart', 'Walk', 'Line', '.My', 'one', 'quibble', 'Walk', 'Line', 'fact', 'huge', 'chunks', 'time', 'were', 'deemed', 'not', 'important', 'enough', 'be', 'included', 'film', 'making', 'film', 'seem', 'almost', 'jumpy', 'stuff', 'would', 'have', 'dumped', 'order', 'see', 'more', 'early', 'life', 'most', 'importantly', 'life', 'June', 'finally', 'got', 'married', 'got', 'together', 'getting', 'married', 'were', 'together', '35', 'years', 'why', 'not', 'show', 'more', 'have', 'applaud', 'Reese', 'did', 'hold', 'own', 'film', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'reduced', 'few', 'lines', 'song', 'more', 'redneck', 'hick', 'role.Elvis', 'also', 'not', 'long', 'really', 'irritated', 'could', 'have', 'chosen', 'better', 'Elvis', 'thousands', 'are', 'there', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'guy', 'look', 'less', 'Elvis', 'ever.It', 'get', 'slightly', 'boring', 'parts', ""'ve"", 'said', 'are', 'big', 'jumps', 'time', 'feel', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'film', 'well', 'do', 'Reese', 'Joaquin', 'voices', ""'m"", 'still', 'loss', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'popular.I', 'keep', 'close', 'watch', 'heart', 'mineI', 'keep', 'eyes', 'wide', 'open', 'timeI', 'keep', 'ends', 'out', 'tie', 'bindsBecause', ""'re"", 'mine', 'walk', 'lineI', 'find', 'very', 'very', 'easy', 'be', 'trueI', 'find', 'alone', 'when', 'day', 'throughYes', ""'ll"", 'admit', ""'m"", 'fool', 'youBecause', ""'re"", 'mine', 'walk', 'lineAs', 'sure', 'night', 'dark', 'day', 'lightI', 'keep', 'mind', 'day', 'nightAnd', 'happiness', ""'ve"", 'known', 'proves', 'rightBecause', ""'re"", 'mine', 'walk', 'lineYou', ""'ve"", 'got', 'way', 'keep', 'sideYou', 'give', 'cause', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hideFor', 'know', ""'d"", 'even', 'try', 'turn', 'tideBecause', ""'re"", 'mine', 'walk', 'line']",Walk the Line

It would not be possible for anyone to portray Johnny and June with more accuracy, and their singing is FABULOUS! This movie is such a wonderful tribute to Cash's life and music, and it's also a beautiful love story. (I completely teared up during the final concert scene at the end of the film...how romantic!) In addition to Phoenix and Witherspoon, the supporting cast boasts excellent performances by Ginnifer Goodwin as Cash's first wife, Vivian, and Robert Patrick as Johnny's father.

Gradually the memories of the couple's musical performances will fade, but the memory of their love transcends simple history.Joaquin Phoenix shines as Johnny Cash, the romantic and the troubled drug user, and as the man who lost a brother.  Joaquin probably used the loss of his own brother, River, in preparing emtionally for the role, but that had to have been very hard.  Reese Witherspoon makes acting look effortless.The movie carries Johnny Cash from his early years, through the tragic loss of his brother, to his love for music.  I remember listening to his songs when I was a kid, but I didn't know that he toured with and around Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis.  I only knew his country years.The scenes and settings feel right and look right.  The visual storytelling gets choppy and leaves a lot out, but it keeps in all the good stuff as well as keeping the story moving along at a fast clip.Even though everyone knows that Johnny and June will get together, it's still emotional and uplifting when he proposes to her on stage during a live performance.  The chemistry between the actors is great.  This is one of those movies that fans will watch again and again.  And if you haven't seen it, you should take the time to do so.

How do you do justice to anyone's life in 120 minutes?There have been good examples of course, but most of them have been good because the writer or director has wisely chosen to telescope/hone in on a relatively short portion of a subject's life: Billie Holiday's in ""Lady Sings the Blues"" or Truman Capote's in ""Capote."" Both films, I realize with wildly different results, but both equally effective because the focus of each has been telescoped and better stated...microscoped onto a short portion of each life: both Truman Capote and Billie Holiday have been revealed and analyzed and effectively appreciated through the learned and discretionary eye of someone who effectively separates the legend from the reality.Director James Mangold (the quirky ""Heavy"" and the effective ""The Yards"") would not seem a logical choice to direct a probing film about Johnny Cash (an audaciously effective Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter ( a wonderful Reese Witherspoon) but he does manage most of the time to steer away from the maudlin and melodramatic and in the process comes up with a good, straight-forward biopic of the two.The obvious comparison to ""Walk The Line"" would be the recent ""Ray"" but whereas Jamie Foxx's recreation of Ray Charles borders on caricature and mimicry, Phoenix's Cash always seems and feels organic: he doesn't so much as inhabit Cash's spirit and persona as interpret it. Phoenix not only uses his own voice to sing the songs...he uses his own psychic voice to creep inside of Cash to reveal the Cash inside of Phoenix and the Phoenix inside of Cash and this translates into a thrilling, revealing portrait of the two.Witherspoon also does her own singing and because we know a lot less of Carter's life, manufactures and makes real a character that is both simple and straightforward as well as one who, though she loves and admires her talented and famous family, longs for her own place in the world in general and in the entertainment world specifically: she is less wounded than Cash but equally on the lookout for personal and professional validation.""Walk The Line"" is not the best movie ever made but it certainly is not the worst.

Phoenix had to learn how to play the guitar and know 26 Cash songs, along with Reese Witherspoon (Just Like Heaven, Vanity Fair) in her best performance so far in her career as the woman Cash fell deeply in love with, June Carter. Witherspoon gives a flawlessly performance...its really fabulous. It begins with Cash and his band at the Folsom Prison but then goes into flashbacks when Cash was a little boy and a tradgic death shook his family. Cash never got along with his father, played by Robert Patrick (Tv's The X-Files, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) and they had a shaky relationship. Then, they show how Mr. Cash married his first wife, played by Ginnifer Goodwin and Cash had 2 kids and how he started his band and his music career making his first record, to breaking in at 14 on the top charts and growing more and more famous. He also had a pill and booze addiction, sometimes too much and he'd get angry, wreck things or look really sick....they show how he collapsed one time performing on stage. It also shows how he grew more and more in love with June Carter but she wouldnt take him, but she couldnt help but come back into his life and eventually she accepted to marry him during one of their performances. One of the best movies of the year without a doubt and Phoenix is a masterwork here almost coming close to sounding like the man himself.

While not a fan of Mr. Cash myself, I learned a lot more about the man via this movie.  Why it works undoubtedly is the performances given by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.  Having won Golden Globes for their performances, the two stars are up for Oscars this Sunday as well, and Ms. Witherspoon is a frontrunner.Phoenix captures the essence of Cash in his physical movements, although ironically, he's probably got a better singing voice than Cash.  He evolves from the starstruck youth to a confident star, although he falls victim to alcohol and drugs.Witherspoon doesn't quite lose her Legally Blonde persona, but as the darkhaired June Carter, she excels in evincing the emotional upheaval Cash brought into her life.Ginnifer Goodwin as Vivian, Cash's first wife, does a fine job as she watches Cash grow further and further from his family life and into Carter's arms.  Robert Patrick is good as Cash's distant and seemingly insensitive father and country/pop singer Shelby Lynne makes a convincing Mama Cash.While James Mangold's direction is very good, the movie itself seems a little too sanitized at times, although exposing Cash's weaknesses is commendable.

As a child, we see two people that shaped his life: his brother and his father.  Skip ahead ten years, and Johnny Cash (Phoenix) is married to his wife, Viv (Goodwin), and has started a band.  After getting a record deal, he finds himself on tour with Jerry Lee Lewis and June Carter (Witherspoon).  Along the way he finds drugs, which threaten his newfound popularity, and he falls in love with June, which just may save him.Both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give excellent performances, sounding and acting just like the stars that they are portraying.  Phoenix is as good, if not better than Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles in last year's ""Ray"".  The story is well told, and it is interesting to see the events that shaped Cash's life, and made him who he is.

637550,A3R36DZQEWNVJ1,B00005JO1R,Mike Bolts,"[3, 4]","Joaquin (Leaf) Phoenix (Ladder 49, Clay Pigeons) blazes and exlpodes emotionally and terrifically as the man in black, Johnny Cash, just as Jamie Foxx did last year when he played legendary Ray Charles. Phoenix had to learn how to play the guitar and know 26 Cash songs, along with Reese Witherspoon (Just Like Heaven, Vanity Fair) in her best performance so far in her career as the woman Cash fell deeply in love with, June Carter. Witherspoon gives a flawlessly  performance...its really fabulous. It begins with Cash and his band at the Folsom Prison but then goes into flashbacks when Cash was a little boy and a tradgic death shook his family. Cash never got along with his father, played by Robert Patrick (Tv's The X-Files, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) and they had a shaky relationship. Then, they show how Mr. Cash married his first wife, played by Ginnifer Goodwin and Cash had 2 kids and how he started his band and his music career making his first record, to breaking in at 14 on the top charts and growing more and more famous. He also had a pill and booze addiction, sometimes too much and he'd get angry, wreck things or look really sick....they show how he collapsed one time performing on stage. It also shows how he grew more and more in love with June Carter but she wouldnt take him, but she couldnt help but come back into his life and eventually she accepted to marry him during one of their performances. One of the best movies of the year without a doubt and Phoenix is a masterwork here almost coming close to sounding like the man himself. A truly great achievement and two great unforgettable performances.

637551,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00005JO1R,Miles D. Moore,"[0, 1]","James Mangold's ""Walk the Line"" is a decent, slightly plodding show-biz biopic that benefits mightily from the astonishing talents of its two stars. If you've seen the film biographies of Elvis, Ray Charles, Buddy Holly, etc., then you've seen this one; the screenplay is fairly standard and doesn't trim all the fat from the story. During some of the expository scenes, I found that I didn't keep my eyes wide open all the time. But when Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were on stage together singing, I was all eyes and ears. Phoenix and Witherspoon have so much electricity together that they virtually give off sparks, and if they don't sound exactly like Johnny Cash and June Carter, they're both good singers and do up the Cash-Carter songbook in fine style. Virtually everybody knows the basic outlines of Cash's story, and it's a story as old as the hills: a good man, beset by tragedy and personal demons, finds redemption through faith in God and the love of a good woman. If Mangold's exposition sometimes gets in the way of the story, Phoenix's performance never does; he brings Cash's pain to galvanizing life, capturing the essence of the man without ever resorting to a mere impressionist's trickery. A few critics have accused Witherspoon of giving us too much Reese and not enough June. I don't know enough about June Carter to tell; I only know that Witherspoon is so charming, funny, impassioned and real here that who cares whether she captures Carter exactly? Among the supporting players, Ginnifer Goodwin does a fine job as Cash's first wife Vivian, and it's not her fault that she appears in some of the more boring scenes. Phoenix and Witherspoon are sure to be remembered at Oscar time, and they are the urgent, overriding reasons to go see ""Walk the Line.""",4,A pretty good movie with great stars.,1132444800,"11 20, 2005",2005,1789,"['James', 'Mangold', 'Walk', 'Line', 'decent', 'slightly', 'plodding', 'show-biz', 'biopic', 'benefits', 'mightily', 'astonishing', 'talents', 'two', 'stars', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'biographies', 'Elvis', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'etc.', 'then', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'screenplay', 'fairly', 'standard', ""n't"", 'trim', 'fat', 'story', 'expository', 'scenes', 'found', 'did', ""n't"", 'keep', 'eyes', 'wide', 'open', 'time', 'when', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'were', 'stage', 'together', 'singing', 'was', 'eyes', 'ears', 'Phoenix', 'Witherspoon', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'electricity', 'together', 'virtually', 'give', 'off', 'sparks', 'do', ""n't"", 'sound', 'exactly', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'June', 'Carter', ""'re"", 'good', 'singers', 'do', 'up', 'Cash-Carter', 'songbook', 'fine', 'style', 'Virtually', 'everybody', 'basic', 'outlines', 'Cash', 'story', 'story', 'as', 'old', 'hills', 'good', 'man', 'beset', 'tragedy', 'personal', 'demons', 'redemption', 'faith', 'God', 'love', 'good', 'woman', 'Mangold', 'exposition', 'sometimes', 'way', 'story', 'Phoenix', 'performance', 'never', 'Cash', 'pain', 'galvanizing', 'life', 'capturing', 'essence', 'man', 'ever', 'resorting', 'mere', 'impressionist', 'trickery', 'few', 'critics', 'have', 'accused', 'Witherspoon', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'Reese', 'not', 'enough', 'June', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'enough', 'June', 'Carter', 'tell', 'only', 'know', 'Witherspoon', 'so', 'charming', 'funny', 'impassioned', 'real', 'here', 'who', 'Carter', 'exactly', 'supporting', 'players', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'fine', 'job', 'Cash', 'first', 'wife', 'Vivian', 'not', 'fault', 'more', 'boring', 'scenes', 'Phoenix', 'Witherspoon', 'are', 'sure', 'be', 'remembered', 'Oscar', 'time', 'are', 'urgent', 'overriding', 'reasons', 'go', 'see', 'Walk', 'Line']",Walk the Line

The film focuses on Cash's personal life and how his music expressed his conflicted personality, but we also see the legendary musicians of Sun Studios under producer Sam Philips: Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, with whom Johnny Cash and Tennessee Three, as well as June Carter, toured the nation. Glimpses of the those musicians evoke the a lifestyle in the early days of touring, when there were no buses, no roadies, and no sleep. I didn't find the film especially sympathetic to Cash's first wife Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), but it is sensitive to June Carter's delicate position as a divorced woman very much in the public eye when divorce was not always acceptable.Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon couldn't be better as off-and-on-again lovers Cash and Carter. Phoenix conveys Johnny Cash's eternal struggle to live up his ideals, his darkness, his love of music, and love for June Carter. Reese Witherspoon expresses Carter's commitment to working hard and pleasing her fans, sometimes through difficult circumstances and personal pain. Phoenix and Witherspoon did all of their own singing, having trained for 3 months under the tutelage of music producer T-Bone Burnett, and they sound great. Musician roles in the film were cast with musicians, which lends some welcome authenticity. Writer and director James Mangold, along with co-writer Gill Dennis, have done a great job of packing a lot of material from the most turbulent period in Johnny Cash's life -and one of the most exciting times in American music- into an entertaining and insightful film. The events of the film are based on Johnny Cash's 2 autobiographies, and he and June Carter had the opportunity to approve the actors who portray them before they passed away in 2003.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006 single disc): Bonus features include 10 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, a theatrical trailer, a soundtrack promotional spot, and an audio commentary by director and co-writer James Mangold. Mangold's commentary is both personal and informative. He provides tidbits of additional historical information, talks about preparing for the film, details of filming, and the film's structure, as well as his conversations with Johnny Cash, his intentions and inspirations, and the film's themes as they reflect Cash's life and personality.

The chemistry these two achieve, aided immeasurably by director James Mangold and music guru T-Bone Burnett, is magnetic.  Phoenix reflects Cash's demons and scarred soul, his eyes stark windows into Cash's wounded but then redeemed heart.

The pair own the movie.  However, they owe two supporting players a load of credit.  Robert Patrick is terrific as Cashs' uncaring father, matching Phoenix blow for blow in a pivotal thanksgiving scene where long held resentments stemming the death of Cash's older brother simmer up to the surface.

The main reason for that is, Hollywood doesn't come up with much that I think is worth reviewing.  I would say that 90% of the movies I have watched failed to hold my interest and in the end, I usually wish I had the last 2 hours of my life back.  Last night, however, I watched WALK THE LINE and was in for a big surprise.I had seen the previews and it appeared that Juaquin Phoenix was able to pull off the roll of Johnny Cash, but for the life of me, I could not grasp the beautiful Reese Witherspoon pulling off the roll of the homely June Carter. Boy was I ever wrong. Phoenix exceeded my expectations.  His performance was comparable to to that of Jamie Foxx playing Ray Charles in RAY, for which I believe he won best actor, and Witherspoon just blew me away with the accuracy of her performance.The other cast members were equally compelling.  The band members were mirror images of the Tennessee Three.

Whether you're a diehard fan of Cash and his music or a movie enthusiast, this movie will keep you intrigued and entertained.""Walk the Line"" starts off by introducing us to a young J.R. Cash (Ridge Canipe) who lives with his family on a farm in Arkansas.  J.R. has a fondness for music (often listening to the family's radio) and is especially close to his brother Jack (Lucas Till).  However, J.R. takes the brunt of his father's (Robert Patrick) anger when Jack is killed in a sawmill accident, an occurrence that would haunt Cash.Several years later, an older Cash (played by Joaquin Phoenix) leaves the family's home, enters the Air Force and finds himself stationed in Germany.  His love for music continues as Johnny buys himself a guitar and starts writing the lyrics to what would become one of his biggest hit songs, ""Folsom Prison Blues"".After his stint in the Air Force, his music career seems to be put on hold when he settles down, marries Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin) and tries his hand at being a door-to-door salesman.  However, an audition with Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts) of Sun Records opens the door to a life (and lifestyle) that he hadn't imagined.Johnny soon finds himself traveling long, arduous tours with the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne), Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton) and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), a member of the Carter family who Johnny had long been infatuated with.  In an ill-fated attempt to balance the grueling schedule, an increasingly volatile family life and his secret love for June, Johnny turns to amphetamines and soon finds himself hooked.  Johnny hits rock bottom and runs the risk of losing everything until June and her family intervene in an effort to save him.  The rest, as they say, is music history.I had high expectations for this movie because of the buzz surrounding it.  I wasn't disappointed.  Even though we know the story's ending, it's interesting to see part of the journey that gets us there.  A good biographical picture gets moviegoers interested enough to make them want to know more about the person being portrayed on the screen even after the film stops rolling and I think ""Walk the Line"" does that.Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were wonderful as Johnny Cash and June Carter and were convincing in their performances, even doing their own singing.  You really feel their emotions come through in each scene they're featured in.  Although they didn't have a lot of screen time, some of the scenes with the supporting cast such as Jerry Lee Lewis' antics and Ezra (Dan Beene) and  Mother Maybelle Carter's (Sandra Ellis Lafferty) run in with Johnny's pill supplier (actually, his run in with them) were fun to watch as well.  Another performance to mention is Robert Patrick as Ray Cash.  His cold-heartedness and criticizing nature seemed to motivate Johnny to prove that he was the better man.While I know that the film was supposed to focus on Johnny and June, I thought some added scenes explaining how he met Vivian would have been nice.  We're told about her when he calls her on the phone from Germany.  When we see her for the first time, they're already married.  It also would have been interesting to see a few more scenes between Johnny and his dad, but the scene at the end did bring a degree of closure to their situation.""Walk the Line"" is definitely one of the best biopic films to come out of Hollywood in recent years.

Well, I do like Johnny Cash's music and felt that this movie was worth my time.Nope, not really....The beginning was pretty good and had me hooked a bit, but then like most movies about musicians/bands, it fell apart and they WAY overdid the drugs and drinking. For a good hour this movie was nothing but Johnny taking pills, Johnny getting mad, June not marrying him, and finally Johnny taking more pills sleeping too long.  Thats about it. There was not nearly enough about the music, the creation of the great songs, and other personal events in Johnny's life.  The movie missed out on details that would have contributed more to the story than the cliche ""drink too much and get enraged"" crap.Also, the film seemed to jump a little too quickly.  One minute, Johnny and his band were really struggling and the next minute they had songs in the top 20.  I missed something here.  It is a struggle to get to the top and this was not portrayed well at all.  He magically woke up one morning and was a star.  I dont expect a two hour movie to show every little step of the way...but c'mon!  There's no drama or intrigue in the ""overnight superstar"" concept.Still though, some of the tunes were good and Phoenix played an OK Johnny Cash.  Reese Witherspoon as June Carter was decent as well.  However, it was NOT enough to save a weak script and a plot that really didnt know what to do with itself.I think this film gets high ratings simply for whos in it.

If you are young and don't know much about Cash's career and personal life you will love this movie and DVD set. When I read Joaquin Phoenix was going to play Johnny I somehow knew he would do a great job...I guess from his looks, mannerisms, and method-acting training. When I read Reese Witherspoon was going to play June Carter Cash, I thought it was a joke. However, Witherspoon does a good job in her part and the chemistry with Joaquin worked very well.What really hurts this movie is the poor script, understanding this is a very difficult movie to make in the first place. However, much of the script doesn't work well and had it not been for great acting by Joaquin, and to a lesser extend Witherspoon, this movie would have been a box office bomb.Without question Joaquin Phoenix should win his Oscar nomination for ""Performance by an actor in a leading role"" at the 78th Annual Academy Awards, Sunday, March 5, 2006, but the odds are against him.  Walk The Line is a financial success only because it was a smaller budget, large release, movie at around $31 million production cost ($60 million after marketing and distribution), and pulled in $153 million in gross revenue, at the time of this post, due to some unexpected great acting. It's nice to see the studio get it right for a change.HAVING DINNER WITH JOHNNY CASH - 25 years ago I got the rare opportunity to join two people and have dinner with Johnny Cash. One of these people was Johnny's personal friend, and I was a tag-along. The evening with Johnny lasted about 4 hours, including after dinner drinks. Me getting to go was nothing but luck and standing in the right place at the right time.At the time, I knew who Johnny Cash was but didn't know how large a legend he was or what an incredible person he was, until that evening.

637577,A1D3XQC2DIT,B00005JO1R,Peter Shermeta,"[1, 1]","Before seeing Walk the Line, I new very little about Johhny Cash. Before it was released in theaters, I knew almost nothing at all. I had heard some of his songs and was more than familiar with his name, but I had no concept of the impact he had on music and on so many lives.The movie touches briefly on Johnny Cash's childhood, enough to paint the picture of a few events and relationships that would shape his life forever. The film next follows Johnny on tour, at the beginning of his career, as he played shows with Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, and a young Miss June Carter. They travel from city to city delighting audiences, playing shows, having a good time, and for some of them, maybe even falling in love.Johnny Cash had more talent than he knew what to do with. But he also had skeletons in his closet and without June Carter, his story would have been one of what could have been, rather than what actually was, one of the greatest careers music has produced. June Carter, despite being the object of Johhny's affection for many years prior to their marriage, played a very valuable role in his life. Among so many other things, June Carter was Johnny Cash's guardian angel. She saved him from his own demons and inspired him to continue his greatness.Before I even begin to comment on the acting, I need to mention something important. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did their own ""stunt work,"" if you will. They sang each song featured in the movie. It is truly an impressive thing they did in lending their singing voices and not just their faces to Johnny Cash and June Carter. I have read that Reese Witherspoon was not a very good match vocally to June Carter, but that should not take away from what she did. Joaquin Phoenix's voice was incredible. I thought he did an amazing job sounding like Mr. Cash.From an acting standpoint I feel that there were two breakthrough performances in Walk the Line. I will start with Reese Witherspoon, whose career has been full of light comedies and naive characters. I have not brought myself to watch many of her earlier movies because they do not appeal to me. I hope that is about to change. Your secret is no longer safe, Reese; we now know that you are an impressive presence on screen. She is not just another pretty face, though she certainly is that. Her performance, which earned her an Academy Award, was full of strength and passion. She did humor, drama, and love and she did each one well.Joaquin Phoenix and I have had many creative differences in the past. Well, I do not know him personally and have never actually met the man, but I refer to the roles he has played. From seeing him as male support during the majority of his career, if you had asked me if I ever thought he could play lead, I would have said no. And I would have been wrong. Joaquin Phoenix played the lead, nay, he owned the lead in Walk the Line. He still showed signs of the actor I have not liked in the past, but managed to still captivate me. Maybe it was his likeness to Johnny Cash's voice as he sang that overshadowed the rest of the performance, but I doubt it. I think he has come a long way. I am sure he has worked very hard to get to where he is now, with one Academy Award nomination under his belt. It has paid off.Walk the Line is a movie with two great performances about two great performers. And I can tell you that you will not be the first to rush out and buy Johnny Cash albums after seeing the movie, or even the soundtrack which features the performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.For another movie with great vocal performances by the actors see The Commitments.",4,Rockin' good time that touches your heart.,1144800000,"04 12, 2006",2006,3669,"['seeing', 'Walk', 'Line', 'new', 'very', 'little', 'Johhny', 'Cash', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'knew', 'almost', 'nothing', 'had', 'heard', 'songs', 'was', 'more', 'familiar', 'name', 'had', 'concept', 'impact', 'had', 'music', 'so', 'many', 'lives.The', 'movie', 'touches', 'briefly', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'childhood', 'enough', 'paint', 'picture', 'few', 'events', 'relationships', 'would', 'shape', 'life', 'forever', 'film', 'next', 'Johnny', 'tour', 'beginning', 'career', 'played', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'young', 'Miss', 'June', 'Carter', 'travel', 'city', 'city', 'delighting', 'audiences', 'playing', 'shows', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'maybe', 'even', 'falling', 'love.Johnny', 'Cash', 'had', 'more', 'talent', 'knew', 'what', 'do', 'also', 'had', 'skeletons', 'closet', 'June', 'Carter', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'what', 'actually', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'careers', 'music', 'produced', 'June', 'Carter', 'being', 'object', 'Johhny', 'affection', 'many', 'years', 'prior', 'marriage', 'played', 'very', 'valuable', 'role', 'life', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'June', 'Carter', 'was', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'guardian', 'angel', 'saved', 'own', 'demons', 'inspired', 'continue', 'greatness.Before', 'even', 'begin', 'comment', 'acting', 'need', 'mention', 'something', 'important', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'did', 'own', 'stunt', 'work', 'will', 'sang', 'song', 'featured', 'movie', 'truly', 'impressive', 'thing', 'did', 'lending', 'singing', 'voices', 'not', 'just', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'June', 'Carter', 'have', 'read', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'match', 'vocally', 'June', 'Carter', 'should', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'what', 'did', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'voice', 'was', 'incredible', 'thought', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'sounding', 'Mr.', 'Cash.From', 'acting', 'standpoint', 'feel', 'were', 'two', 'breakthrough', 'performances', 'Walk', 'Line', 'will', 'start', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'career', 'been', 'full', 'light', 'comedies', 'naive', 'characters', 'have', 'not', 'brought', 'watch', 'many', 'earlier', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'appeal', 'hope', 'change', 'secret', 'no', 'longer', 'safe', 'Reese', 'now', 'know', 'are', 'impressive', 'presence', 'screen', 'not', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'certainly', 'performance', 'earned', 'Academy', 'Award', 'was', 'full', 'strength', 'passion', 'did', 'humor', 'drama', 'love', 'did', 'one', 'well.Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'have', 'had', 'many', 'creative', 'differences', 'past', 'Well', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'personally', 'have', 'never', 'actually', 'met', 'man', 'refer', 'roles', 'played', 'seeing', 'male', 'support', 'majority', 'career', 'had', 'asked', 'ever', 'thought', 'could', 'play', 'lead', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'wrong', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'played', 'lead', 'nay', 'owned', 'lead', 'Walk', 'Line', 'still', 'showed', 'signs', 'actor', 'have', 'not', 'liked', 'past', 'managed', 'still', 'captivate', 'Maybe', 'was', 'likeness', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'voice', 'sang', 'overshadowed', 'rest', 'performance', 'doubt', 'think', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'am', 'sure', 'worked', 'very', 'hard', 'get', 'where', 'now', 'one', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'belt', 'paid', 'Line', 'movie', 'two', 'great', 'performances', 'two', 'great', 'performers', 'can', 'tell', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'first', 'rush', 'out', 'buy', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'albums', 'seeing', 'movie', 'even', 'soundtrack', 'performances', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon.For', 'movie', 'great', 'vocal', 'performances', 'actors', 'see', 'Commitments']",Walk the Line

In actuality, this movie is both the life story of Johnny Cash and the love story between him and June Carter.  The movie is solid with impeccable performances particularly by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.  In ""behind the scene"" feature, the Director himself commented that both performers exceeded his expectations and they managed to get their mannerisms spot-on.  What impresses me even more is the downright chemistry & effortless bond that those performers are able to convey of Johnny Cash and June Carter.  The movie has moments of flashback and it tracks down Johnny's gradual rise and downfall and his victory over his demon in a linear progression and along the way, we get to see Johnny's fascination with June since childhood, how their lives collided, how his persistency finally paid off in winning her heart over.  It's surreal to see his performances together with other prominent performers in the fifties such as Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis & Roy Orbinson.  Once again, in the special edition, the Director compiles individual performances of Johnny, June and the mentioned three performers into a jukebox sequences that can be enjoyed on its own merit.  The special edition also has interviews of Johnny's friends and relatives who talked about his faith, him as a person (and not simply a singer), the process of getting the real Johnny Cash and June Carter to approve of this movie (overall, it takes a decade to bring it into fruition) and also the making of Joaquin and Reese into the real stars.

Personally I didn't really know that much about Johnny Cash before I went to see this movie, and I must say it made a deep impression.It is a sad story, and you really struggle with Cash throughout the movie. His life indeed was no picnic, being the invisible son to his fathers' eyes, the loss of his best friend and older brother favored of the two even long after his early, tragic death (this truely haunts Johnny Cash, and the cold relationship between him and his father), his drug and alcohol abuse the way it grows along with his carreer, his turbulent marriage, Johnny Cash simply doesn't function until he is gradually saved by his one and only true love -June Carter. From his early days listening to her voice on the radio as a kid (she was a child star), it also grows to become a gripping, beautiful lovestory. ""Walk the line"" introduces Johnny Cash as a kind and gentle, but a soulsick and lonely man. Until the outcome of his relationship with June Carter that is. The ending has a tone of the ""...and they lived happily ever after...""-kind, and it is well earned!It is brilliantly expressed between many of his old music-classics, with great acting and the dialogue in focus.

637582,A1TAWJ2PA3USVX,B00005JO1R,"P. M Simon ""El Simon Asombroso""","[0, 0]","There's a lot of powerhouse acting talent in the Johnny Cash biopic WALK THE LINE.  It's also quite accurate despite giving in now and then to the temptation to toss in hindsight, as when young touring semi-star Johnny is urged to start doing drugs because Elvis does.Both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Withersoon deliver the performances of their careers as Johnny and touring partner/soulmate/eventual partner/mate June Carter.  The feel of the period is wonderful and Robert Patrick is in top form as Johnny's humble but wise Arkansas father. Director James Mangold does fine and the two top stars sing the numbers themselves and do superbly.  Of course they aren't Johnny and June, but they are mighty close and they certainly have the gestures, body language, and mannerisms to go along with the voice.Despite all these obvious plaudits, the film has two weaknesses as a bipic and both are the fault of the script.  First, although others have noted that there's not a lot about Cash's childhood and USAF time in the film, it is more disturbing that it just sort of ends. Johnny and June get married and we're told they lived happily ever after for their last 35 years.  I could have used more about what was over half of the hero's adult life, after all.Second flaw was that the film didn't make me care about Johnny Cash.  If you already are a fan that may not matter but most viewers will not have been.  To them, Cash is portrayed as an indolent youth, a slacker in the airforce, a crummy husband and father, a pill-popping adulterer, etc.  Let's just say that although the portrayal was accurate, it might have been more sympathetic.Still, this shouldn't take too much away from a fine and well-crafter film.  By all means get it.The DVD is fine quality and you may want to order a soundtrack, too.",4,A Lot of Talent,1145145600,"04 16, 2006",2006,1804,"['lot', 'powerhouse', 'acting', 'talent', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'biopic', 'WALK', 'THE', 'LINE', 'also', 'quite', 'accurate', 'giving', 'now', 'then', 'temptation', 'toss', 'hindsight', 'when', 'young', 'touring', 'semi-star', 'Johnny', 'urged', 'start', 'doing', 'drugs', 'Elvis', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Reese', 'Withersoon', 'deliver', 'performances', 'careers', 'Johnny', 'touring', 'partner/soulmate/eventual', 'partner/mate', 'June', 'Carter', 'feel', 'period', 'wonderful', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'top', 'form', 'Johnny', 'humble', 'wise', 'Arkansas', 'father', 'Director', 'James', 'Mangold', 'fine', 'two', 'top', 'stars', 'sing', 'numbers', 'do', 'superbly', 'course', 'are', ""n't"", 'Johnny', 'June', 'are', 'mighty', 'close', 'certainly', 'have', 'gestures', 'body', 'language', 'mannerisms', 'go', 'along', 'voice.Despite', 'obvious', 'plaudits', 'film', 'two', 'weaknesses', 'bipic', 'are', 'fault', 'script', 'First', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'not', 'lot', 'Cash', 'childhood', 'USAF', 'time', 'film', 'more', 'disturbing', 'just', 'sort', 'ends', 'Johnny', 'June', 'get', 'married', ""'re"", 'told', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'last', '35', 'years', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'half', 'hero', 'adult', 'life', 'all.Second', 'flaw', 'was', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'care', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'already', 'are', 'fan', 'may', 'not', 'matter', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'Cash', 'portrayed', 'indolent', 'youth', 'slacker', 'airforce', 'crummy', 'husband', 'father', 'pill-popping', 'adulterer', 'etc', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'portrayal', 'was', 'accurate', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'sympathetic.Still', 'should', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'fine', 'well-crafter', 'film', 'means', 'get', 'it.The', 'DVD', 'fine', 'quality', 'may', 'want', 'order', 'soundtrack', 'too']",Walk the Line
637583,AB1UMC7SB9D7Z,B00005JO1R,"PolarisDiB ""dibness""","[5, 7]","Honestly, I was incredulous when Ray was getting all the attention it was getting.I was incredulous when Walk the Line was getting all the attention it was getting.And what do you know but that is but an arbitrary and minor parallel that ties these two brilliant works of art together.While some people might complain about a formula developing, such a complaint is slightly unfair.  Sure, the focus of the two movies are similar enough that the exposition of the storyline sometimes seems a bit familiar, something that in a time where originality is upheld as one of the highest virtues, might lead people in the wrong direction about regarding works such as these critically.So they both involve a death of a brother at a young age.  Uh, those deaths?  They actually happened.  So they both involve drug addiction.  Uh, that actually happened.  So they both involve adultery and special love interest.  Well, that actually happened.  And you say it's a shame how both deal so much with post-traumatic stress disorder?  Well... with the things they've gone through.But focusing on Walk the Line alone now, let us contemplate on what this movie so GOOD.For one thing, the acting comes readily to mind.  Acting is one of the most readily apparent and focused on parts of filmmaking for the reason that it's basically what makes or breaks the story.  The acting in this film?  Brilliant, and I'm not just saying that.  Joaquin phoenix's role isn't just unbelievable... it's really believable.  Reese Witherspoon pulls of June Carter and honestly it's difficult to imagine an actress like her actually pulling the strings like that.  Okay, so I'm biased because she's been in mainstream movies of little importance.  But that's the point: she does really well, completely redefining my image of her.And then they can both sing, which I find hilarious considering most vocalists of modern bands can't even seem to sing yet two actors can and can also sing exactly like the people they're portraying.  Ahhh, the state of modern music... but I digress.Secondly, the writing.  As discussed above, the story follows the same rough outline as Ray, but it is different in this way: Johnny Cash is a different character than Ray Charles.  Furthermore, the story they tell of Johnny Cash's life is very good, very touching, and very well presented.  It made the music itself seem that much more powerful.Oh, and the music.  I'm no fan of country music, and I haven't had much exposure to Johnny Cash besides listening to the live prison album alluded to in the movie, but this is some very strong stuff.  It's easy to imagine that miming and overrecording would have been used, but the mere fact that it wasn't just adds one of those indefatigable aspects of what makes this movie work so well.Then of course there's the directing and the cinematography.  Specifically, if anyone's doubting the impactfulness of the work behind the camera, I argue to rewatch that long shot where Cash tears apart the bathroom.  Watch how everything possible seems to be at full work here, movement, zoom, acting, makeup, set design, music, atmosphere, lighting, all targeted in such a way that it does not feel reasonable to assume that such a take could ever be done again, even if all the same mechanics were at work.Okay, so I've basically just hyped it up a whole lot more, adding to that same hype that has people tired and sick of the whole idea of the movie before they've seen it.  Admit it, the mere fact that it's been nominated for some Oscars means that it already feels overrated.  I know exactly what you mean......afterall, what made me wait to see it so long?But whatever.  Think what you want.  I think this film is pretty darned great.  I'm just sayin'.--PolarisDiB",5,When everything's at work...,1139616000,"02 11, 2006",2006,3756,"['Honestly', 'was', 'incredulous', 'when', 'Ray', 'was', 'getting', 'attention', 'was', 'getting.I', 'was', 'incredulous', 'when', 'Walk', 'Line', 'was', 'getting', 'attention', 'was', 'getting.And', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'arbitrary', 'minor', 'parallel', 'two', 'brilliant', 'works', 'art', 'people', 'might', 'complain', 'formula', 'developing', 'complaint', 'slightly', 'unfair', 'Sure', 'focus', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'similar', 'enough', 'exposition', 'storyline', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'familiar', 'something', 'time', 'where', 'originality', 'upheld', 'one', 'highest', 'virtues', 'might', 'lead', 'people', 'wrong', 'direction', 'regarding', 'works', 'such', 'critically.So', 'involve', 'death', 'brother', 'young', 'age', 'Uh', 'deaths', 'actually', 'happened', 'involve', 'drug', 'addiction', 'Uh', 'actually', 'happened', 'involve', 'adultery', 'special', 'love', 'interest', 'Well', 'actually', 'happened', 'say', 'shame', 'how', 'deal', 'so', 'much', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'disorder', 'Well', 'things', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'through.But', 'focusing', 'Walk', 'Line', 'alone', 'now', 'let', 'contemplate', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'GOOD.For', 'one', 'thing', 'acting', 'readily', 'mind', 'Acting', 'one', 'most', 'readily', 'apparent', 'focused', 'parts', 'filmmaking', 'reason', 'basically', 'what', 'breaks', 'story', 'acting', 'film', 'Brilliant', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'saying', 'Joaquin', 'phoenix', 'role', ""n't"", 'just', 'unbelievable', 'really', 'believable', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'pulls', 'June', 'Carter', 'honestly', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'actress', 'actually', 'pulling', 'strings', 'Okay', ""'m"", 'biased', 'been', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'little', 'importance', 'point', 'really', 'well', 'completely', 'redefining', 'image', 'her.And', 'then', 'can', 'sing', 'find', 'hilarious', 'considering', 'most', 'vocalists', 'modern', 'bands', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'sing', 'yet', 'two', 'actors', 'can', 'can', 'also', 'sing', 'exactly', 'people', ""'re"", 'portraying', 'Ahhh', 'state', 'modern', 'music', 'digress.Secondly', 'writing', 'discussed', 'story', 'same', 'rough', 'outline', 'Ray', 'different', 'way', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'different', 'character', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Furthermore', 'story', 'tell', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'life', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'touching', 'very', 'well', 'presented', 'made', 'music', 'seem', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'powerful.Oh', 'music', ""'m"", 'fan', 'country', 'music', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'much', 'exposure', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'listening', 'live', 'prison', 'album', 'alluded', 'movie', 'very', 'strong', 'stuff', 'easy', 'imagine', 'miming', 'overrecording', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'mere', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'one', 'indefatigable', 'aspects', 'what', 'movie', 'work', 'so', 'well.Then', 'course', 'directing', 'cinematography', 'Specifically', 'anyone', 'doubting', 'impactfulness', 'work', 'camera', 'argue', 'rewatch', 'long', 'shot', 'where', 'Cash', 'tears', 'apart', 'bathroom', 'Watch', 'how', 'everything', 'possible', 'be', 'full', 'work', 'here', 'movement', 'zoom', 'acting', 'makeup', 'set', 'design', 'music', 'atmosphere', 'lighting', 'targeted', 'such', 'way', 'not', 'feel', 'reasonable', 'assume', 'take', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'done', 'again', 'even', 'same', 'mechanics', 'were', 'work.Okay', ""'ve"", 'basically', 'just', 'hyped', 'up', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'adding', 'same', 'hype', 'people', 'tired', 'sick', 'whole', 'idea', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Admit', 'mere', 'fact', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'already', 'overrated', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'mean', 'afterall', 'what', 'made', 'wait', 'see', 'so', 'long', 'Think', 'what', 'want', 'think', 'film', 'pretty', 'darned', 'great', ""'m"", 'just', ""sayin'."", 'PolarisDiB']",Walk the Line
637584,A2VN986E5KR1NV,B00005JO1R,ProperGander News (Dr. Emil Shuffhausen),"[6, 7]","One word that always comes to mind whenever I think of Johnny and June Carter Cash is the word INTEGRITY.  Everything about their lives and their music was authentic.  How fitting is it, then, that this biopic starring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon rings utterly true and heartfelt...with all the passion, pain, and redemption one should expect from a re-telling of this quintessential love story.Director James Mangold paces the story perfectly, from Johnny's early days on a cotton farm to his early struggles in music and marriage; and then his first encounter with the zesty, sparkling, lovely June...even as his depression and drug abuse spiral out of control.  It's a ""warts and all"" portrayal, but is never purient or pandering...or preachy.  Ultimately, it's a story of redemption and restoration, but it has a freshness and vitality that owes everything to the splendid performances of Phoenix and Witherspoon in the lead roles.  Both of them absolutely nail their characters but never once lapse into caracature.  They even actually sing all of their parts--wonderfully, I might add--rather than lip sync.The legend of Johnny Cash is so towering and epic that it surely must have seemed a daunting task to bring it to the screen.  Phoenix humanizes Cash in a way that surely Cash would appreciate could he see it.  Cash was, by turns, reverent and profane...gentle and violent...tender and raging...but never, ever lukewarm or phony.  Phoenix captures both the strength and the pathos of this brilliant, complex--yet also heartfelt, direct, and even simple--titan.And Witherspoon is a delight in her role as June Carter; so vivacious and seemingly strong, but also fragile in her own way.  She completely lights up the screen every second she is on it.  She displays a fantastic range of emotions throughout the film; funny one moment, tough the next.  The viewer completely understands why Johnny was so instantly--and constantly--smitten with June, thanks to Witherspoon's luminous portrayal.The sets and costumes are spot-on perfect, whether its 1930s Arkansas or 1950s Memphis.  The viewer is completely transported to each time and place; nothing feels false here. It's such an engaging and engrossing ""vibe"" that this viewer was a bit stunned and disappointed when the theater lights came on and the film ended.Perhaps the climactic scene in the film is the re-creation of Johnny and June's landmark Folsom Prison concert.  Crackling with energy and intensity, this one vignette powerfully portrays what Johnny and June were all about...identifying so directly with people in pain; doing whatever it takes to lift their spirits. This viewer found it very difficult to stay seated--one wants to stand, stomp, and shout during the rousing performance.All of the supporting cast is stellar.  Enjoy watching actors bring The Tennessee Three, Sam Phillips, Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, Waylon Jennings, and others to life.  Shooter Jennings, portraying his dad, is particularly strong.  I would be remiss if I neglected to mention Ginnifer Goodwin's powerfully understated and heartbreaking portrayal of Johnny's first wife, Vivian.  Her tragic eyes say so much as she helplessly watches her husband spiral downward in a frustrating and ever tightening vortex of self-destruction.The film is rated PG-13 for some brief and infrequent strong language and harrowing scenes of drug use and addiction.  The heavy moments, however, are frequently leavened with welcomed, healthy doses of humor.I cannot recommend this film highly enough.  I was personally moved deeply throughout by Johnny and June's triumphs over adversity and their great love for one another.  June's unconditional love for Johnny at his worst is handled in a way that shows her great strength; no enabler was she, but a fiesty, fiery, and ultimately angelic presence.  If Phoenix doesn't win the Academy Award for Best Actor, then the Oscars are a farce.  And that goes double for Witherspoon's tour-de-force portrayal of June.Viewers will leave with a smile on their lips, a song in their hearts, and a little bit of boom-chicka-boom in their step.",5,The mud and the blood and the beer,1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,4137,"['One', 'word', 'always', 'mind', 'whenever', 'think', 'Johnny', 'June', 'Carter', 'Cash', 'word', 'INTEGRITY', 'Everything', 'lives', 'music', 'was', 'authentic', 'How', 'fitting', 'then', 'biopic', 'starring', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'rings', 'utterly', 'true', 'heartfelt', 'passion', 'pain', 'redemption', 'one', 'should', 'expect', 're-telling', 'quintessential', 'love', 'story.Director', 'James', 'Mangold', 'story', 'perfectly', 'Johnny', 'early', 'days', 'cotton', 'farm', 'early', 'struggles', 'music', 'marriage', 'then', 'first', 'encounter', 'zesty', 'sparkling', 'lovely', 'June', 'even', 'depression', 'drug', 'abuse', 'spiral', 'control', 'warts', 'portrayal', 'never', 'purient', 'pandering', 'preachy', 'Ultimately', 'story', 'redemption', 'restoration', 'freshness', 'vitality', 'everything', 'splendid', 'performances', 'Phoenix', 'Witherspoon', 'lead', 'roles', 'absolutely', 'nail', 'characters', 'never', 'once', 'lapse', 'caracature', 'even', 'actually', 'sing', 'parts', 'wonderfully', 'might', 'add', 'rather', 'lip', 'sync.The', 'legend', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'so', 'towering', 'surely', 'must', 'have', 'seemed', 'daunting', 'task', 'bring', 'screen', 'Phoenix', 'Cash', 'way', 'surely', 'Cash', 'would', 'appreciate', 'could', 'see', 'Cash', 'was', 'turns', 'reverent', 'profane', 'gentle', 'violent', 'tender', 'raging', 'never', 'ever', 'phony', 'Phoenix', 'strength', 'pathos', 'brilliant', 'complex', 'yet', 'also', 'heartfelt', 'direct', 'even', 'simple', 'titan.And', 'Witherspoon', 'delight', 'role', 'June', 'Carter', 'so', 'vivacious', 'seemingly', 'strong', 'also', 'fragile', 'own', 'way', 'completely', 'lights', 'up', 'screen', 'second', 'fantastic', 'range', 'emotions', 'film', 'one', 'moment', 'tough', 'next', 'viewer', 'completely', 'why', 'Johnny', 'was', 'so', 'instantly', 'constantly', 'smitten', 'June', 'thanks', 'Witherspoon', 'luminous', 'portrayal.The', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'spot-on', 'perfect', '1930s', 'Arkansas', '1950s', 'Memphis', 'viewer', 'completely', 'transported', 'time', 'place', 'nothing', 'feels', 'false', 'here', 'such', 'engaging', 'engrossing', 'vibe', 'viewer', 'was', 'bit', 'stunned', 'disappointed', 'when', 'theater', 'lights', 'came', 'film', 'climactic', 'scene', 'film', 're-creation', 'Johnny', 'June', 'landmark', 'Folsom', 'Prison', 'concert', 'Crackling', 'energy', 'intensity', 'one', 'vignette', 'powerfully', 'what', 'Johnny', 'June', 'were', 'identifying', 'so', 'directly', 'people', 'pain', 'doing', 'lift', 'spirits', 'viewer', 'found', 'very', 'difficult', 'stay', 'seated', 'one', 'stand', 'stomp', 'shout', 'rousing', 'performance.All', 'supporting', 'cast', 'stellar', 'Enjoy', 'watching', 'actors', 'bring', 'Tennessee', 'Three', 'Sam', 'Phillips', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'Waylon', 'Jennings', 'others', 'life', 'Shooter', 'Jennings', 'portraying', 'dad', 'particularly', 'strong', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'neglected', 'mention', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'powerfully', 'understated', 'heartbreaking', 'portrayal', 'Johnny', 'first', 'wife', 'Vivian', 'tragic', 'eyes', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'helplessly', 'husband', 'spiral', 'downward', 'frustrating', 'ever', 'tightening', 'vortex', 'self-destruction.The', 'film', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'brief', 'infrequent', 'strong', 'language', 'harrowing', 'scenes', 'drug', 'use', 'addiction', 'heavy', 'moments', 'however', 'are', 'frequently', 'leavened', 'welcomed', 'healthy', 'doses', 'humor.I', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'highly', 'enough', 'was', 'personally', 'moved', 'deeply', 'Johnny', 'June', 'triumphs', 'adversity', 'great', 'love', 'one', 'June', 'unconditional', 'love', 'Johnny', 'worst', 'handled', 'way', 'great', 'strength', 'enabler', 'was', 'fiesty', 'fiery', 'ultimately', 'angelic', 'presence', 'Phoenix', ""n't"", 'win', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actor', 'then', 'Oscars', 'are', 'farce', 'double', 'Witherspoon', 'tour-de-force', 'portrayal', 'June.Viewers', 'will', 'leave', 'smile', 'lips', 'song', 'hearts', 'little', 'bit', 'boom-chicka-boom', 'step']",Walk the Line

That Sun Record group was a great collection of musicians.  Like just about everybody else, I was impressed with his Folsom Prison album.  I've considered ""Folsom Prison Blues"" a bold classic of Country Western music.  However, in the years after that stage in his life, I sensed a gradual decline of talent.  In the years before his passing, I thought it a shame than no one took him aside to point out that he'd lost his singing voice.  Some of the later commercials he lent that ""singing"" voice to were as embarassing as some of the scenes in ""Walk the Line"".  There's no question, however, that Johnny Cash had a life that was worthy of a major motion picture.  Fortunately, ""Walk the Line"" was worthy of its' subject.The movie begins with a look at tragedy and dysfunction in Cash's youth.  It does an excellent job of providing illuminating vignettes of his young adult years and his start in music.  Eventually he becomes a star and the fame and fortune becomes too much.  His first marriage is examined with the sort of balance that comes from having his children involved in the production of the movie.  In a dramatic scene of confrontation, Cash tells his first wife ""You're not perfect either"" after getting an earful of what his faults are.  We know just enough about her to know he's right (and she's right as well).  The emerging relationship with June Carter is the real focus of the movie and that, too, was well developed.  It took a lot of patience, however, with the self-destructive life style Cash was leading.  The concert at Folsom Prison served as the defining point in the movie.

One thing I just know as a professional musician even though I am clean and always took the art form very seriously, is that in music, no matter what musical style you play, there is always drugs knocking down our door.Drugs killed Jimi Hendrix, Charlie Parker, Whitney Houston and many other great musical legends. Fortunately for Johnny Cash with the angelic help of June Carter he got over it.To anyone that reads this so they can understand musicians a bit more because musicians are very unique beings - very sensitive as we transform our feelings into MUSIC. Unfortunately, the music business is very hostile and cruel. Sometimes the demons from our childhood hunts us down and lead to our own self destruction like happened to Johnny Cash because of his father.It is a common saying in MUSIC that the roads of excess lead to the Palace Of Wisdom. I don't know about that. One thing all music styles have in common is the drugs are always there whether you want to or not. If you are strong enough you can still be successful no matter what and discard them.I'm very thankful to Hollywood and John Cash Jr for bringing us the story of his father just like Clint Eastwood filmed BIRD so many years ago here for posterity.There are so many music stories like this one yet to be filmed that should be told for future generations.Johnny Cash was a door to door salesman and thanks to Sam Phillips form SUN RECORDS got a record deal and then he moved up the ladder and became thanks to his talent over time - JOHNNY CASH.One thing I noticed that happened to Johnny Cash, just like Richard Nixon, is that the demons from his childhood chased him through his career and in Richard Nixon's case to the White House.This is a wonderful film by one of the greatest musicians of our time and it made me a Johnny Cash fan. I have to buy the cd LIVE AT FOLSOM PRISON that is one of the most important recordings of our time.Last but not least, thank you JOAQUIN PHOENIX and REESE WHITHERSPOON.

The movie's plotline derives from Johnny Cash's autobiographies, ""Man In Black"" and ""Cash The Autobiography"", which provide an authentic narrative of what the man was about.  The film appears to be two films in one due to its immense content of the film that reveals Cash more in depth.  There are the intimate aspects of the man and his music, and how one of the first couples of country music, John (Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter Cash (Reese Witherspoon), came to be making the film a love story about the music and between two people.The film is quite exceptional in capturing the ""Man in Black.""  Viewers will see the forces that drove him to create a unique blend of music that was all heart and soul: gospel, rock and roll, blues, and country-western.  Joaquin Phoenix's did a well-done depiction of the man, and recreating Cash during the years in which he struggled through his rise to fame, and his brief down and out with drugs.  One can see how Phoenix's performance flowed with Cash's influence within him.  Indeed, Cash helped to kick start rock and roll about the same time as Elvis Presley, especially with his involvement with Sun Records.  His story almost falls into the same lines as Elvis', but Cash's experiences looms deeper and darker than the king, which involved tragedy, blood, sweat, and tears, and final triumph.Walk The Line is recommended for all music lovers, especially those who are curious in understanding the history of rock and roll and the sum of all its parts.",5,"""I'm on a love walk...a June Carter love walk.""",1148342400,"05 23, 2006",2006,1561,"['Line', 'captures', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'life', '1944-1968', 'movie', 'plotline', 'derives', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'autobiographies', 'Man', 'Black', 'Cash', 'Autobiography', 'provide', 'authentic', 'narrative', 'what', 'man', 'was', 'about', 'film', 'be', 'two', 'films', 'one', 'due', 'immense', 'content', 'film', 'Cash', 'more', 'depth', 'are', 'intimate', 'aspects', 'man', 'music', 'how', 'one', 'first', 'couples', 'country', 'music', 'John', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'June', 'Carter', 'Cash', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'came', 'be', 'making', 'film', 'love', 'story', 'music', 'two', 'people.The', 'film', 'quite', 'exceptional', 'capturing', 'Man', 'Black', 'Viewers', 'will', 'see', 'forces', 'drove', 'create', 'unique', 'blend', 'music', 'was', 'heart', 'soul', 'gospel', 'rock', 'roll', 'blues', 'country-western', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'did', 'well-done', 'depiction', 'man', 'recreating', 'Cash', 'years', 'struggled', 'rise', 'fame', 'brief', 'down', 'drugs', 'One', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'Phoenix', 'performance', 'flowed', 'Cash', 'influence', 'Indeed', 'Cash', 'helped', 'kick', 'start', 'rock', 'roll', 'same', 'time', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'especially', 'involvement', 'Sun', 'Records', 'story', 'almost', 'same', 'lines', 'Elvis', 'Cash', 'experiences', 'deeper', 'darker', 'king', 'involved', 'tragedy', 'blood', 'sweat', 'tears', 'final', 'triumph.Walk', 'Line', 'recommended', 'music', 'lovers', 'especially', 'who', 'are', 'curious', 'understanding', 'history', 'rock', 'roll', 'sum', 'parts']",Walk the Line

They gave excellent performances but the movie as a whole just wasn't that exciting where you'd watch it again and again.Eventhough I'm not a big fan of country music, I was looking for the movie to give me a reason why Cash became the ICON he was, and was looking for more into why his father (played well by Robert Patrick, my favorite Terminator of Terminator 2 fame) and him had such a horrible relationship even before his brother died, and well after.  It was almost as if they portrayed CASH as a man who couldn't function partly because of his starved approval he desperately wanted from his father which obviously we know, he'd never get.I think the director wasted a lot of time not going in depth about what it was about June Carter that made CASH basically abandon his first wife and children and go on a psychopathic trail to get her.As far as the prison scene at Folsom, there was a lot more interaction between CASH and the inmates that was left out.  After all the Live From Folsom CD was not only his so-called comeback album, but one of the biggest lp's at that time outselling even the Beatles.Overall, I don't blame the actors/actresses I blame the director for not utilizing them more and going more into depth about CASH's life.

Their onscreen chemistry is palpable and, jaded old movie watcher that I am, I found myself instantly accepting the bond that Phoenix and Witherspoon portray together. Surprisingly, the vocals are all theirs, too (thankfully! with a vocal style as distinctive and unmistakable as that of Johnny Cash, it would have been stupid to attempt to lip-synch, in my opinion), and here more praise must be heaped on the pair - not only can they sing these songs, they perform them with real spirit and energy.Another cast highlight is Robert Patrick as Ray Cash, giving an excellent performance as the nasty daddy - perhaps the only flaw of the movie's script is that it does not allow for much development of characters like Ray Cash or Vivian - but Patrick and Ginnifer Goodwin, insofar as they're able, don't allow their small parts to become two-dimensional, so it's not all bad news.Direction is great - James Mangold displays a real sense of affinity with the music hall style of C&W; performance and, as with the rest of the picture, this comes across as a believable, plausible style.

Absolutely amazing in every aspect. Nothing could've been better. Everything, from the casting of Shooter Jennings as Waylon Jennings, to the Oscar-worthy performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, is absolutely exceptional in this movie. This beats Jamie Foxx's ""Ray"" by a lot.Joaquin Phoenix brilliantly portrays the troubled Johnny Cash, in such a way that you feel for Mr.Cash. It makes you want to jump onto the screen, and throw Johnny's pill bottles away. Reese Witherspoon (though she is considerably prettier than June Carter was) does a wonderful job at her part. One of the most impressive things these two people did, was actually sing in the movie! Most actors who have to play rock stars have the music dubbed in, and just hope they can lip it well enough to look convincing. Well, I'm convinced. The singing sounded great, and I, being a music/movie obsessive and a Texas Pre-Area Bass 2, would know. Johnny Cash is pretty much the only country I listen to, him and Hank Williams, with an occasional Buck Owens tune.I loved this movie. Oh, and how about a shout out to the rest of the cast! The two men playing Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley were hilarious, and the men playing Johnny Cash's ""Two Tennessee Men"" were great.This movie beats Narnia, King Kong, and any other movie I've seen this year, and almost my whole near-15 years of existence.

Bur durdle dur dur dur durrrr dur...""Hello I'm Johnny Cash and I'm gonna propose marriage to my duet partner onstage during a performance of a song so lame neither of us would touch it solo, so we do a duet"". Did he actually propose to June in that way and finally get a yes?. ""Now I'm gonna go onstage so smashed that I pass out. My doctors call my condition acute wahfloompia. All of a sudden the sufferer goes waaaaah...floomp."" Well, that's an exaggeration, but the way this flick trivializes Johnny Cash's life story is almost that bad. Johnny once told interviewers that he was part of the Rockabilly sub-genre, so called because they were ""rockin' hillbillies"", and that faction also included Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and a few others. It's easy to assume that Elvis was the king of that bunch, and this movie does go a long way towards dispelling that myth. Johnny was the most powerful songwriter of that group, with his Leadbelly-esque compostional style of chronicling hard times. But that's either touched upon lightly or just plain implied and it takes a Cash fan to spot it. Otherwise, for all of its semi-noir approach, this film approaches Cash's life in a rather superficial way. I don't doubt that we'll be seeing it on ABC some night.

637607,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JO1R,RMurray847,"[3, 5]","Film biographies are always a bit tricky, in my opinion.  I always find myself wondering which parts are ""true"" and which parts are rearranged, condensed, combined, etc.  For example, in WALK THE LINE, there's a terrifically dramatic scene near the end when Johnny Cash proposes to June Carter.  The circumstances of the proposal are almost TOO perfect, from a storytelling / dramatic standpoint.  Did it really happen that way, or did the filmmakers take liberties because the truth would have been less cinematically interesting?  At least, when I watch fiction, I know it's all made up.  And when I watch ""non-fiction"", I know liberties will be taken...I just don't know where.That aside, WALK THE LINE is a pretty satisfying film bio.  First of all, Joaquin Phoenix is terrific.  He doesn't really look like Cash...I always thought Cash was a big man...Phoenix is not.  But we forget these surface dissimilarities almost right away, because Phoenix embodies the character in more important ways.  He creates a full-blooded character.  And the fact that he sang the songs himself is pretty amazing.  Again, his voice isn't a dead-on copy (he can't quite as low as Cash), but there are enough times when a particular phrase comes out EXACTLY like we remember that the viewer is completely satisfied.  It was great to hear some older Cash songs that I had forgotten I knew.  Reese Witherspoon, as June Carter, gives her best dramatic performance yet.  She has one great scene when she is shopping in a small general store in some town they are touring through.  First, she meets some admiring fans and her manner in being perfectly lovely to them while still cutting their conversation short is terrific, and moments later, she is confronted by a clerk who heartily DISAPPROVES of June's recent divorce...and Reese's face is wonderful to watch.  We see her shame and a smidge (just a smidge) of anger...and her response (well written, but REALLY well delivered) is great.  This is a time before everyone went around being sarcastic / ironic, and her reply is genuine and non-ironic and painful and totally appropriate.  There are times in the film when Reese's generic ""perkiness"" comes through a bit more than I would like...but overall, she's quite solid.  Phoenix should certainly get an Oscar nomination...Witherspoon is slightly less deserving, in my opinion, but I wouldn't put up a fight if she did get nominated.One thing I really like is that the film plays out a lot of its drama right on stage.  The concert scenes are fabulously believable.  There's great singing and playing of great music, there's totally believable banter (I don't mean the banter is believable...it's totally ""staged"" for the audiences, but it feels exactly like what would have been delivered to audiences of the `50s & early `60s) and there's a LOT of subtext being played out.  Whether it's the looks Johnny gives to June as she waits off stage, or their chemistry when they sing together...you almost get all you need to know about their relationship by how the shows go.  When Johnny reaches rock bottom with drug use...we see it on stage.  When he's totally enamored of June, we see it on stage.  I love that the film makes this choice with its storytelling.I also want to mention a great supporting turn by Robert Patrick (X-FILES, TERMINATOR 2) who plays Cash's father.  I don't think his part has Oscar written on it...it's not that showy.  But Cash's father has a HUGE influence on Johnny, and Patrick plays him strongly enough that we can palpably feel how Johnny is affected by him.  It's a critical role, and Patrick nails it.  After TERMINATOR 2, his roles on film haven't always been the best.  I hope this gets him some juicier material...Agent Doggett will always have a soft spot in my heart.The movie isn't perfect.  I felt the Folsom Prison concert was just a bit of a dramatic letdown.  Yes, this is a famous album and famous moment in Cash's career, but the film tries to make an awful lot of it, and then they don't actually show us much of the show.  Also, the inevitable closing titles, when we are told in a few superimposed words about the rest of Johnny and June's lives are quite brief and uninformative.  Those two went on to rather amazing careers for another 30+ years.  The care and devotion they were shown in the film is quickly tossed aside in a few glib summary statements.

637611,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JO1R,Robert Moore,"[8, 14]","In watching WALK THE LINE I couldn't help but be struck by the parallels between Johnny Cash's background and that of my mother.  Like him, she was raised in a small Arkansas town (albeit in the hills in the northern part of the state rather than the delta area) in a somewhat rustic house and was often called upon to join her family in picking cotton.  And like Johnny Cash, in an effort to find a better life left the small town she grew up in for Memphis (though she later relocated to Little Rock).  So, this is a movie that is very much about my kind of people.The parallels between WALK THE LINE and last year's RAY will be obvious to everyone who has seen both films.  Both deal with Southern-born musicians who struggled with drugs before eventually kicking the habit.  The romantic parallels are not so sharp, but the relative period of their success was close.  Johnny Cash was not the musical innovator that Ray Charles was, but both achieved a place close to the hearts of Americans.  Interestingly, it was Johnny Cash, the white Arkansan who achieved crossover success as a country performer who was involved in more liberal causes, while the black Floridian Ray Charles was a Republican.  I mention this just to highlight what ironic and unusual paths people's lives can take.The film covers the life of Johnny Cash roughly from his early childhood until just before his marriage to June Carter.  In talking to friends, I have been amazed that even those who have seen the film were unaware of June Carter's background, and when I mentioned the Carter Family they were not clear on who they were.  If there is a First Family in American country music, it is the Carter Family.  Along with Jimmy Rodgers, they were the most influential act in early country music history, and those two along with Hank Williams are the genre's greatest musical influences.  Formed by A. P. Carter, Maybelle Carter was his sister-in-law and one of the most important influences on American guitar finger picking, developing the walking bass note that is fundamental to music ever since.  When A. P. and his wife divorced, Maybelle took over the group, involving her daughters in what was essentially the second version of the Carter Family.  June was one of those daughters.Before their deaths June and Johnny Cash gave their blessings to this production and gave final approval to the performers who would play them.  On the acting end of things both performers are simply outstanding, and both fully deserve the Oscar nominations both have received.  Reese Witherspoon is simply adorable as June Carter, generating more charisma than one could think possible.  She is much shorter than the real June Carter, but since Joaquin Phoenix is much, much shorter than Johnny Cash, giving away about a half a foot, their heights are not terribly disproportionate.  Both performers worked vigorously on their singing in preparing for the film.  Reese, especially, does a good job with her singing.  She doesn't capture that snarl that made June Carter so much fun to listen to, but she nonetheless does a very credible job singing.  Phoenix gives it a great try, but how could any actor be asked to emulate Johnny Cash?  It simply can't be done.  Johnny Cash had one of the few great bass voices in popular music and even though for the most part he sang in a baritone range, there was always a depth and deepness to his voice that undergirt all he did.  And when he did need to drop down for those low, low, low notes, he did so effortlessly.  Phoenix simply can't pull it off. It really isn't his fault at all.  No other actor I know of could have done any better.  He does, however, at least pull off a lot of the rambunctiousness of the young Johnny Cash.  My daughter when in junior high bought a poster of the young Johnny Cash and put it in her room.  It shows Johnny Cash leaning forward from the stage towards the audience, almost savage in his demeanor, pointing one hand towards someone in the crowd, middle finger extended in an obscene gesture.  As he aged, perhaps calmed by his relationship with June it became more difficult to discern that wild man, but Phoenix certainly captures much of that.All in all, this is a very good movie and I enjoyed every aspect of it.  My only serious regret is Phoenix's singing.  This is unfortunately not a peripheral matter.  Johnny Cash possessed one of the most unique, marvelous voices of his generation, and having anyone play him who cannot absolutely nail the singing would be a mistake.  It would be like having someone play Frank Sinatra.  You have to get the voice.  Still, it would be a hard person who couldn't find a great deal in this film to love.  And if for no other reason, one has to see this simply to see how precious Reese Witherspoon is.",4,An excellent biopic driven by superb lead performers,1140652800,"02 23,

637612,A1O6T6SYB8HFC2,B00005JO1R,"Robert Twain ""Rob""","[3, 3]","""Walk the Line"" is an excellent portrayal of the life of Johnny Cash, an American rock and country icon, and of his relationship with June Carter, whom he has been in love with since he was a boy. This film is very similar to the 2004 film ""Ray"", but has two excellent lead performances instead of one. Excellent musical performances and a solid cast make for one great film, one of the best of 2005.Joaquin Phoenix is incredible as the Man in Black, fully channeling not only his performances on stage, but also his life offstage, his strange obsession with June Carter and his struggles with prescription pills. Reese Witherspoon gives the performance of a lifetime as June Carter. Cash and Witherspoon's onscreen chemistry is one of the key factors in the overall success of this film. Excellent dialogue exchanges between the two keep the movie fun and exciting, with each lead performance bringing something different to the table. There's Phoenix channeling Cash's troubled soul and addiction problems, and then there's Witherspoon's quirky, upbeat character who quite literally saves Cash's life from a downward spiral of addiction.The film's music is great, with one memorable supporting performance with Tyler Hilton as Elvis Presley, complete with the hip-shaking dance routine.

Zwick,"[3, 4]","Because it is based on two of his own published memoirs (""Cash: the Autobiography"" and ""The Man in Black""), ""Walk the Line"" becomes, in many ways, the ""official"" movie biography of musician/singer/songwriter Johnny Cash - and it isn't really the movie's fault that it arrives so close on the heels of ""Ray,"" the equally critically acclaimed film about Ray Charles.  The similarities between the two stories are, at times, positively amazing:  the meteoric rise to stardom, the unhappy marriage, the serial philandering, the substance abuse, the arrest for drug possession.  Heck, there's even the death of a beloved brother in a freak childhood accident that comes to haunt both the men for the rest of their lives.  Yet, ""Walk the Line, "" written by Gill Dennis and James Mangold and directed by Mangold, triumphs over its biopic cliches thanks to solid writing, toe-tapping musical numbers and superb performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon in the key roles of Cash and singing superstar - and future wife - June Carter.Phoenix pours his whole heart and soul into his performance both as an actor and as a singer, reproducing Cash's sound and vocal intonations with uncanny accuracy.  Witherspoon captures Carter's sizzle and spunk perfectly, yet brings a real sensitivity and thoughtfulness to the character.  Their romantic scenes together are some of the best in the film and it is as a romance, rather than as a cautionary tale of the perils of show business, that the movie really connects with its audience.We've seen a lot of this stuff before, but all credit to the actors, we don't mind watching it again.",4,great acting overcomes standard story,1140048000,"02 16, 2006",2006,1630,"['based', 'two', 'own', 'published', 'memoirs', 'Cash', 'Autobiography', 'Man', 'Black', 'Walk', 'Line', 'becomes', 'many', 'ways', 'official', 'movie', 'biography', 'musician/singer/songwriter', 'Johnny', 'Cash', ""n't"", 'really', 'movie', 'fault', 'so', 'close', 'heels', 'Ray', 'equally', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'film', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'similarities', 'two', 'stories', 'are', 'times', 'positively', 'amazing', 'meteoric', 'rise', 'stardom', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'serial', 'philandering', 'substance', 'abuse', 'arrest', 'drug', 'possession', 'Heck', 'even', 'death', 'beloved', 'brother', 'freak', 'childhood', 'accident', 'haunt', 'men', 'rest', 'lives', 'Walk', 'Line', 'written', 'Gill', 'Dennis', 'James', 'Mangold', 'directed', 'Mangold', 'triumphs', 'biopic', 'cliches', 'thanks', 'solid', 'writing', 'toe-tapping', 'musical', 'numbers', 'superb', 'performances', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'key', 'roles', 'Cash', 'singing', 'superstar', 'future', 'wife', 'June', 'Carter.Phoenix', 'whole', 'heart', 'soul', 'performance', 'actor', 'singer', 'reproducing', 'Cash', 'sound', 'vocal', 'intonations', 'uncanny', 'accuracy', 'Witherspoon', 'Carter', 'sizzle', 'spunk', 'perfectly', 'yet', 'real', 'sensitivity', 'thoughtfulness', 'character', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'together', 'are', 'best', 'film', 'romance', 'rather', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'perils', 'show', 'business', 'movie', 'really', 'audience.We', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'stuff', 'credit', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'again']",Walk the Line

Cash became the iconic half of Johnny Cash and June Cater Cash.  It's a story with the ups and downs we've all come to expect from a celebrity bio - the talented artist finds himself trying to deal with family trauma and dysfunction, has bad brushes with substance abuse and is ultimately redeemed by love to become the icon that he's remembered for.  Johnny's start was a precarious one - he sounded horrible until he could learn to channel his past into his music.  The story informs Cash's rise during run-ins with Elvis & Jerry Lee Lewis.  He courts the lovely June Carter.  The Carters are already celebrities in Country music before Cash enters the scene, yet they're down-to-earth, and probably more sympathetic to Cash than June is.  (They get one of the funniest scenes in the movie when, while still June still remains unmarried to Johnny, they giveCash's drug supplier the double-barrel brush off.)  Joaquin Phoenix doesn't quite look like Cash, but he goes the distance when it comes to capturing Cash's talent for injecting gobs of angry and funny energy into his bottomless baritone.  This is best displayed when Phoenix kicks off his show at Fulsom Pen - creating the now historic concert album - with ""Cocaine Blues""; Phoenix plays Cash like a demon, a performance alone that should have netted him an Oscar (he lost to Hoffman for ""Capote"").  Robert Patrick is a surprise with the unenviable job of Cash's father - a stiff and unartistic soul who nevertheless managed to escape alcoholism, yet seems unwilling to help his son out of his own substance abuse problem.In short, it's funny and sad - something that most celeb bios shoot for, but few achieve.  Even if the script seems to lag, Phoenix and Witherspoon save the day.

The Blue Plate Sally Field.Pedestrian director James Mangold wisely builds his movie around John(played  by Joaquin Phoenix) and June's protracted affair that begins on their first tour while they're married. That Cash-brand folk music runs underneath most scenes, but ""Walk The Line,"" aims to be a love story, and succeeds. Phoenix and Witherspoon have the necessary chemistry, and Cash's first wife (Ginnifer Goodwin) is slanted as such a grim, unhappy grinch it is a small joy when she orders John to take down a photo of June and walks out when he refuses. It's still several years before June agrees to marry John, but the way is finally clear. There's only a drug habit to kick and some self-abuse to endure.""Walk The Line"" has a backstory for all the pain - a mean father (Robert Patrick) who blames John for his brother's death, that grim wife, the drugs, the alcohol, the tours, several bad influences (which include Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis). We assume the music is written somewhere in there; we see John on stage and at Folsom Prison, but not in the studio. Maybe rightly so - Cash was revered more as the Man In Black than as a talent; unlike ""Ray,"" which cared about how Ray Charles created his art and survived by his business savvy, ""Walk The Line"" envisions Cash as little more than the guy who attends corporate meetings standing up, shades on, some country James Dean with the Holy Spirit bolting through him. Phoenix's performance addresses the legend more than the man. It's all blowups, booze and romance from the gut.Witherspoon does something different with June; she embodies the reluctant-yet-radiant everywoman, a tough skin, soft center, an archetype as old as Shakespeare. June starts with small questions and warm smiles inside a diner. She progresses to a scene when, in a moment of sincere affection, she tells John just what she wants to say about his talent, and what John never has heard from his father or wife. Who doesn't fall in love with that? That June finally falls too makes sense because John adores her.There's no mystery in Witherspoon. No hidden cards. She brings the same tomboyish, attractive skills to every movie, and for each ""Walk The Line,"" there is a ""Vanity Fair,"" where, regardless of her diligence, the magic is lacking. She's not a master talent like Meryl Streep or Kidman, but a punch-the-clock professional who, when she chooses wisely, can pack charm, wit and sweetness into one of the best performances of the year.

The story seemed similar to last year's Oscar winning biopic on Ray Charles and I wasn't sure a story about Johnny Cash would hold my interest for two hours. After all, this was the singer my dad used to listen to. Little did I know how fascinating Cash's tale would be.The story touches on Cash's childhood and the tragedy and abuse that would provide the basis for many of his songs. Johnny Cash didn't have the nicest voice but when he sings about pain and regret, you honestly believe he's inside Folsom Prison. Most of the film charts Cash's inevitable path from aspiring songwriter to cultural icon. He has the expected bumps along the way but the tale ends up being inspiring. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon turn in Oscar worthy performances as Cash and his wife and frequent collaborator June Carter Cash. A fun part of the films is that Johnny and June were contemporaries of Elvis, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis and we get to see them represented as well.These kinds of movies are good for people of my generation because they bring home exactly how innovative and visionary the performers of the past were. It's easy to hear Johnny Cash's voice over an Alamo commercial or see Ray Charles crooning about Diet Pepsi and think they are just silly old men trying to milk their fame. Movies like this make us reinvestigate their pasts to see exactly how trend setting they were. Johnny Cash and Ray Charles were cool, they were the very essence of cool. It would be difficult to imagine the performers of today, many of whom are overindulged and overrated, paying the kinds of dues these guys did and coming up with anything as unique.",5,Fascinating,1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,1720,"['recently', 'saw', 'theater', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'going', 'story', 'seemed', 'similar', 'last', 'year', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'biopic', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'story', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'would', 'hold', 'interest', 'two', 'hours', 'was', 'singer', 'dad', 'used', 'listen', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'how', 'fascinating', 'Cash', 'tale', 'would', 'be.The', 'story', 'touches', 'Cash', 'childhood', 'tragedy', 'abuse', 'would', 'provide', 'basis', 'many', 'songs', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'nicest', 'voice', 'when', 'pain', 'regret', 'honestly', 'believe', 'inside', 'Folsom', 'Prison', 'Most', 'film', 'Cash', 'inevitable', 'path', 'aspiring', 'songwriter', 'cultural', 'icon', 'expected', 'bumps', 'way', 'tale', 'up', 'being', 'inspiring', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'turn', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performances', 'Cash', 'wife', 'frequent', 'collaborator', 'June', 'Carter', 'Cash', 'A', 'fun', 'part', 'films', 'Johnny', 'June', 'were', 'contemporaries', 'Elvis', 'Carl', 'Perkins', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'get', 'see', 'represented', 'well.These', 'kinds', 'movies', 'are', 'good', 'people', 'generation', 'bring', 'home', 'exactly', 'how', 'innovative', 'visionary', 'performers', 'past', 'were', 'easy', 'hear', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'voice', 'Alamo', 'commercial', 'see', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'crooning', 'Diet', 'Pepsi', 'think', 'are', 'just', 'silly', 'old', 'men', 'trying', 'milk', 'fame', 'Movies', 'make', 'reinvestigate', 'pasts', 'see', 'exactly', 'how', 'trend', 'setting', 'were', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'were', 'cool', 'were', 'very', 'essence', 'cool', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'performers', 'today', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'overindulged', 'overrated', 'paying', 'kinds', 'dues', 'guys', 'did', 'coming', 'up', 'anything', 'unique']",Walk the Line

But his baritone never did much for me, and his hallowed status has always been thrust upon me by his many indignant fans.  Something about the Man in Black makes his most ardent fans want to fight to defend the man and his music.I mention this only to say that I was not really looking forward to ""Walk the Line,"" the biopic that does for Cash what ""Ray"" did for Ray Charles.  The similarities between these two men and the two movies are striking.  Both feature heroes raised literally dirt-poor, teaching themselves music, making it big, and inflicting damage on themselves and others through colossal substance abuse.  And along the way, they make some of the most beloved music America has produced.Joaquin Phoenix plays the grown-up Cash, and he nails it.  Cash, with his deep voice and brawler's physique, may be one of the most difficult of artists to channel, but Phoenix does it well.  Initially, Cash struggles as he tries to form an old-timey gospel trio.  But his life is transformed when a music agent tells him, sing like you've got one song left to sing, and God's going to hear it.  Cash responds to this challenge by belting out ""Fulsom Prison Blues,"" and finding the Johnny Cash sound - ""strong as a train and sharp as a razor.""  That Phoenix does all his own singing, and does it well, is a plus to his fine acting job.Reese Witherspoon plays June Carter, a daughter in the Carter family of country music royalty.  On the radio since she was 4, she unwittingly inspires Cash, who listens to her on his old radio as a boy.  As adults, they find themselves on tour, and despite missteps and mis-marriages, an undeniable romance blossoms between these two best friends.  One wonders what she saw in the Man in Black, since he spends several years in a wasteland of drugs and booze . . . and yet while June walks away from time to time, Cash never leaves her heart.  And Witherspoon captures Carter's spunk and devotion, and provides another example of an actress who can really sing.This is powerful stuff, if conventional.  You don't go to ""Walk the Line"" to see anything original - you go because these are two lives that tell one great story.

Usually you look closely at the fine print and see that the esteemed critic lauding the film is Joe Schmoe from the One Stop Light Bugle Press in Buttcreek, Illinois or a low level flunky who just happens to work for the media conglomerate that is distributing the film. So my heart sank a little when a film I have been eagerly awaiting was swaddled with such praise when the ads hit the air.But they're right for once.Joaquin Phoenix wears Johnny Cash like a suit. He isn't doing a Rich Little impersonation, you don't rub your eyes in disbelief, but he channels a man so distinct in appearance and voice to a level that is beyond admirable. One of the traits that made Johnny Cash a legend was that nobody sounded or looked like him. Short of a computer generated Cash walking around in his own bio-pic like one of those John Wayne beer commercials this is the definitive representation.And yet Phoenix may not give the best performance in the film.Reese Witherspoon more than holds up her end in a role that easily could have been reduced to a clich&eacute;d bumpkin. Witherspoon portrays the on-stage June in the way June portrayed her own ""character"", the stage persona that people adored, while giving her the resolve and inner strength to be the woman who tamed a hell-bent, grizzly bear of a man like John.The chemistry of Phoenix and Witherspoon together in any scene, but their on-stage duets in particular, are truthful in a way that resonates long after the credits. I know that unless you have been living in a cave for the past week you have likely been bombarded with the word that the actors sing themselves without use of lip syncing. I have never been a fan of musicals, or even musical performances in a film. They generally seem forced and uncomfortable to me, the moment when I stop experiencing the story and feel reminded that I am watching a movie. I never felt that in this film. I never felt that their singing took the focus of the film, but the performances work with the story like no other music bio I have ever seen. I never felt as if I was being led through the catalog, the songs felt as organic and natural as any spoken dialog in a great narrative.This film far exceeded my expectations and afforded me the first trip home from a theater with a true feeling of satisfaction in a very, very long time.

He has nailed the part of Johnny Cash and, quite feasibly, an Oscar.Rather than try and cram his entire life in under 2 hours, WTL focuses instead on Johnny's early life (dysfunctional alcoholic father, tragic death of his beloved older brother Jack) and the gospel music his mother taught him. After joining the Air Force and eventually returning from Germany, Johnny marries Vivian Liberto (Ginnifer Goodwin)and quickly has his first child. But Johnny can't make ends meet as a door-to-door salesman. After seeing Elvis through the back door of a local recording studio, Johnny gets the idea to form his own band and make a record- and the rest of his career is history.Oddly enough, this film isn't as much about Cash's career as it is a beautiful love story between him and June Carter, played superbly by Reese Witherspoon. From a nearly decade long addiction to ampetamines to a bitter divorce from Vivian, Cash survives it all and pursues June single mindedly until the refusals to his marriage proposals become an acceptance. It's no wonder Cash died just three months after his beloved June passed away- their connection ran deeper than friendship or marriage- they truly were soulmates.

637630,A1XEFHQZP8Y35W,B00005JO1R,Silver Screen,"[3, 5]","Hearing so many positive and glowing reviews of ""Walk the Line"" I looked forward to seeing it, once it was on DVD.  I worried that like many films you anticipate watching, I would be let down.  Happily, I was not disappointed in the least.While ""Line"" is the story of Johnny Cash, it is more than just that - - it's really the story of a love affair that not only took ten years to culminate but according to Cash himself, saved his life.Despite the wealth of material to choose from in Cash's life, the film spans basically from 1955 to 1968.  There are several brief scenes from Cash's childhood, establishing his family structure (or lack thereof), his early love and interest in music and a tragic family accident that led to years of guilt for Cash.  The film then flashes forward to Cash being in the Air Force and writing songs, then being married to his first wife, Vivian and attempting to make a go as a salesman.  As we all know, Cash was no salesman, unless it came to his music.  On a fluke, he sings for Sam Phillips and before you know it, he has a record out and is quickly touring with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and June Carter.In my opinion, these are the best parts of the film.  Cash's interaction with the lovely and honest June, and being part of the tour circuit.Of course, with all the adulation and success comes the downfalls -- the alcohol, the drugs and the women.  And Cash falls prey to all of them.  His family life suffers as he is away from home touring, and when he is home, he is preoccupied and getting his fix.  Perhaps the weakest part of the film is the lack of development with the storyline on his first marriage.  Obviously his boozing, pill popping and womanizing take a toll on his marriage -- but that avenue isn't really explored.  Cash and Vivian do seem to fight and disagree a lot and eventually they do divorce -- with Vivian taking their children.June Carter, meanwhile, has had her own bumpy love life.  She has divorced her first husband, much to the consternation of some of the strict religiously zealous citizens who feel that marriage should be forever.  She married for a second time, but not happily.  She has two young daughters to raise and she is in love with Johnny Cash.As Cash spirals downward into drug and alcohol abuse, June is there to help him pick up the pieces.  She stays by his side and helps him kick his dependency.The movie ends with Cash's live performance at Folsom Prison, before those inmates who can relate to his music, and a performance in Ontario, where Cash proposes to June on stage.This film could have gotten bogged down in detail, or just not clicked.  Biopics are very hard to do - - particularly with such a public figure, beloved by so many.  But this film succeeds and succeeds so well mainly because of the performances.Joaquin Phoenix simply amazed me as Johnny Cash.  I forgot I was watching Mr. Phoenix as Johnny Cash, he transformed himself INTO Johnny Cash.  You could see the pain his eyes, speaking of his brother, his guilt, his dependency on the drugs and alcohol and his deep love for June.Reese Witherspoon is perfection as June Carter Cash -- her physical loveliness would be enough to make someone fall in love with her, but her strength and heart shine through.Phoenix and Witherspoon's singing together is phenomenal.  I am not a country fan, nor did I know much about Johnny Cash before this film, but I found myself tapping my foot along to the music and looking forward to the next musical number.  Neither Phoenix nor Witherspoon shamed themselves in any way by doing their own singing - - they both looked completely natural playing their respective instruments and singing along with each other.This film was an absolute delight and makes clearly evident why both Phoenix and Witherspoon were nominated for Best Acting honors.

637633,A3KOMZ79UJSZ2I,B00005JO1R,Soulboogiealex,"[2, 3]","Johnny Cash is one of America's most legendary musicians. One of those rare artists that manage to transcend the genre they're moving in. Although Cash is unmistakably a country artists he always managed to appeal to a much broader audience.  In the fifties he had much appeal to the R&R; audience of Elvis and Roy Orbison. In the sixties he became part of the protest generation because of his outlaw image and prison records.  In the nineties he came back courtesy of Rick Rubin. He was then embraced by both the alternative audience and the gansta rappers. At the MTV video awards Snoop Dogg paid homage to him, and numerous rockers took on his songs as he did with them. A movie on his life was just waiting to happen.In Walk The Line director James Mangold takes a pretty straight forward approach to telling the Cash story. The movie follows a chronological path to the Folsom Prison concert. The registration of this concert would become his most enduring and biggest selling records. Joaquin Phoenix makes a convincing Johnny Cash. His posture, expression and way of handling himself seem to bring Cash back to life. Reese Witherspoon makes a formidable partner. Throughout the movie the interplay between them is thrilling to see. The romantic story of Johnny Cash and June Carter seems cut for Hollywood and certainly rubs of on these fine actors. Both Joaquin and Reese sing themselves in this movie, a daring choice that works out fine. Although the voice of Phoenix takes some getting used to his deliverance, timbre and timing often come awfully close to the real deal sparing us the discomfort seeing an actor lip singing  to a dead man's voice. Witherspoon actually sings better than June.The way the story is told is somewhat disappointing. Johnny Cash was in life a dark and brooding personality, a man of extremes. Often torn between self-destruction and the need for redemption, consumed by drugs and his past, battling between his love for June and his hatred for himself, attracted to both sin and purity, Cash was not an easy man by any means. This ongoing conflict fails to surface in its totality throughout the movie. It almost seems as if Mangold took away some of the sharpest edges to make the movie more easy on us. This takes away some of the depth the movie could have had. Mangold chooses to focus on the romance and the music. Cash's fascination with scripture and self-destruction or his youth trauma remain safely in the background of this love story. Although this does deliver an entertaining movie it's not the definite bio-pic it could have been.",4,Good but not definite.,1145836800,"04 24, 2006",2006,2586,"['Johnny', 'Cash', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'legendary', 'musicians', 'One', 'rare', 'artists', 'manage', 'transcend', 'genre', ""'re"", 'moving', 'Cash', 'unmistakably', 'country', 'always', 'managed', 'appeal', 'much', 'broader', 'audience', 'fifties', 'had', 'much', 'appeal', 'R', 'R', 'audience', 'Elvis', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'sixties', 'became', 'part', 'protest', 'generation', 'outlaw', 'image', 'prison', 'records', 'nineties', 'came', 'back', 'courtesy', 'Rick', 'Rubin', 'was', 'then', 'embraced', 'alternative', 'audience', 'gansta', 'rappers', 'MTV', 'video', 'awards', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'paid', 'homage', 'numerous', 'rockers', 'took', 'songs', 'did', 'movie', 'life', 'was', 'just', 'waiting', 'happen.In', 'Walk', 'Line', 'director', 'James', 'Mangold', 'pretty', 'straight', 'forward', 'approach', 'telling', 'Cash', 'story', 'movie', 'chronological', 'path', 'Folsom', 'Prison', 'concert', 'registration', 'concert', 'would', 'become', 'most', 'enduring', 'biggest', 'selling', 'records', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'convincing', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'posture', 'expression', 'way', 'handling', 'seem', 'bring', 'Cash', 'back', 'life', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'formidable', 'partner', 'movie', 'interplay', 'thrilling', 'see', 'romantic', 'story', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'June', 'Carter', 'cut', 'Hollywood', 'certainly', 'rubs', 'fine', 'actors', 'Joaquin', 'Reese', 'sing', 'movie', 'daring', 'choice', 'out', 'fine', 'voice', 'Phoenix', 'getting', 'used', 'deliverance', 'timbre', 'timing', 'often', 'come', 'awfully', 'close', 'real', 'deal', 'sparing', 'discomfort', 'seeing', 'actor', 'lip', 'singing', 'dead', 'man', 'voice', 'Witherspoon', 'actually', 'better', 'June.The', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'was', 'life', 'dark', 'brooding', 'personality', 'man', 'extremes', 'Often', 'torn', 'self-destruction', 'need', 'redemption', 'consumed', 'drugs', 'past', 'battling', 'love', 'June', 'hatred', 'attracted', 'sin', 'purity', 'Cash', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'man', 'means', 'ongoing', 'conflict', 'surface', 'totality', 'movie', 'almost', 'Mangold', 'took', 'away', 'sharpest', 'edges', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'easy', 'away', 'depth', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'Mangold', 'chooses', 'focus', 'romance', 'music', 'Cash', 'fascination', 'scripture', 'self-destruction', 'youth', 'trauma', 'remain', 'safely', 'background', 'love', 'story', 'deliver', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'not', 'definite', 'bio-pic', 'could', 'have', 'been']",Walk the Line

The story follows the rise and brief fall (before rising again) of music legend Johnny Cash.  A struggling door-to-door salesman, Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) likes to play guitar and sing with his two closest pals, much to the chagrin of his wife.  One day while wandering through downtown Memphis, Johnny stumbles upon Sam Phillips' Sun recording studio, where he sees and hears Elvis Presley cutting a disc.  Johnny tracks down Mr. Phillips and convinces him to hear his band.  Phillips requires convincing, but he eventually agrees to take a chance on Cash.  Their initial record is a hit, and they find themselves on the road with Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and June Carter(Reese Witherspoon), who descends from a famous singing family.  Johnny and June have an obvious chemistry almost immediately.  This is a problem, because not only is Johnny a married father, June, also a parent, is just getting through a divorce, which in 1956 was still considered morally scandalous.The film continues through Johnny's initial struggle with drugs and his attempts to win his father's approval, as well as his tumultous relationship with June.  The music is presented in an exciting way, thanks to Phoenix's ability to capture Cash's onstage charisma.  Phoenix and Witherspoon, both novice singers prior to the film, both do well.  Phoenix's Cash starts out rough around the edges musically, and gets more polished.  Witherspoon sounds like a natural country singer. Both actors deliver terrific performances.

It starts in 1968 inside Folsom Prison, flashes back to Cash's childhood in the Deep South of the early 1950's, then works its way back up to 1968 and beyond.  With brilliant performances by Joaquin Phoenix (Oscar nominee) and Reese Witherspoon (Oscar winner), Cash's life and music career come alive.  Both actors spent months learning how to do their own singing and guitar playing live before an audience, and it shows in the electrifying musical numbers.Director/co-writer James Mangold filmed the movie on location in Memphis, Nashville, and Arkansas along (I think) the Mississippi River.  The 1950's and 1960's sets and costumes, from my own childhood era, are perfection and should have been Oscar-nominated if they weren't.  The film runs 135 minutes, but between the concert scenes and period re-creation, I never wanted it to end.  If WALK THE LINE has any flaw, in fact, it is that it could have lasted longer for me and didn't just put three more decades of narrative crawls against a black finale background.  I wanted more music and more of the perfect Phoenix and Witherspoon performances.This may be one of the finest musical biographies I have ever seen.  The DVD includes a directors' commentary and 10 deleted scenes that help clarify scene and character. WALK THE LINE is a beautifully crafted labor of love movie gem.  It particularly deserved the Sound Mixing Oscar nomination for spectacular concert scenes.  The movie plays and sounds, inexplicably, way better on DVD than in a theater. It is an absolute must-see.

First we had Ray, then Beyond the Sea, and now we have Walk the Line, and I am only counting the movies that I can think of, that has come out starting in 2004, even through I do know there has been a lot more movies like this. The movie stars Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, and they both do thier own singing in this movie, rather in some other movies where they either get somebody to come in and to the singing, with the actor lip synching, or even lip synching to the singer's records such in Ray. And who knows what other movies that we see of musical bio picks, and who will play the role, and will they do thier own singing, or lip synching, either to recordings, or whoemver they get to do the singing voice. The movie begins in 1968, when Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) is about to do a live concert in a prison. The name of the prison is Folsom Prison, and then we flash back 24 years earlier, when we meet 12 years old (Ridge Canipe) and his older brother Jack (Lucas Till), who live a life on a farm. Jack spends his time with the bible, Johnny listening to singers including June Carter on the radio, thier father ((Robert Patrick) drinks, and thier mother (Shelby Lynne) retreats into gospel standards from the Heavenly Highway Hymnal. But then saddness hits the family, when Jack is killed in a circular-saw accident. And there father says that god took the wrong boy. And then we flash to 1955, when Johnny Cash is married to his high school sweetheart Vivian Cash (Ginnifer Goodwin).

The one standout film for the year was ""Walk the Line,"" the Johnny Cash bio-pic.In an era when films are full of darkness and lack good, quality storytelling, ""Walk the Line"" was a glimmer of hope. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Man in Black is startling, proving that he is one of the most versatile actors in hollywood. There were a few times when I thought that it really was Cash up there, and not an actor. Equally impressive is Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. She plays here as both a spit-fire and a compassionate friend who saves Cash from....well, Cash. It's these two performances that give the film it's soul, and the fact that the two stars did all their own singing makes it a very impressive film. The supporting cast, such as Ginnifer Goodwin, Robert Patrick, and Dallas Roberts as Sam Phillips, are solid.The 2-Disc Collector's Edition for the film is a must-have for Cash and movie collectors. The extras are excellent, including a featurette about Johnny's historic concert at Folsom Prison, where he emerged as the Man in Black.""Walk the Line"" is an exceptional film with fantastic acting, fine storytelling, and excellent music that will have your toes tapping before the end.

But this is the story according to the movie: Johnny (previously J.R.) comes from a poor family with a very mean father who views his kids as being put on earth to work and slave for him. Johnny goes into the Air Force, begs his girlfriend to marry him (after they haven't seen each other for 2 years), then, once they are married, doesn't do much to support his family.  His love is music, and he becomes successful.  Someone offers him some sort of illegal pills, telling him ""Elvis takes them"", so he says sure, and becomes addicted in short order. Meantime, he cheats on the wife he was dying to marry with groupies and lusts after June Carter. Gets drunk and high, etc. His wife finally gets fed up with his hurtful betrayal and refusal to change, takes the kids and leaves.  June apparently has some sort of savior complex, because she keeps coming whenever Johnny needs her.  She refuses to marry him, but finally gives in when he swears he will stop hurting her as he has previously (after they're married, he sleeps with her sister, but they leave that part out).  What was so great about this guy as a marriage prospect, I couldn't figure out, but he was persistent, I'll give him that. One of those men who always wants what he can't have. And then once he has it, he doesn't want it anymore. In the film, Johnny's dad comes around frequently to make disapproving faces and remind him of his shortcomings, but Johnny is always too wasted to tell him to get lost, and lets his dad push his buttons every time.Joaquin Phoenix does a pretty good job of looking drugged out and helpless most of the time, and Reese Witherspoon does a great job of acting classy, strong, yet vulnerable.

With stars like Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon portraying Johnny Cash and his wife, June Carter, this movie is filled with powerhouse performances.Walk The Line is unique and entertaining because it has all the singers actually sing their own songs instead of editing Cash's own voice into the movie. Reese Witherspoon took singing lessons and really shines in some music scenes as she sings for audiences in the movies. Pheonix shows he can sing too and gets the crowds going so well you can't help but tap your foot along with the music.The acting is great also, as every character adds their bit into the movie to make you feel as if you were witnessing Cash's life when he was still a young man. Some great scenes have him starting to sing for a record company and sing about his problems with the air force and his lifestyles.The movie starts off with Cash as a young man back in Arkansas who is noticed for his unique voice and how he sang about different topics that normally would create controversy and disbelief with people. His life takes a turn for stardom as he takes a tour around the country and meets up with June Carter, who he later starts a relationshp with.Reese Witherspoon was absolutely wonderful as a young woman who was great to every fan who talked to her and went out of her way to start a conversation with anyone who asked for an autograph from her. She and Cash had a rocky relationship as they both fall for each other, become disgusted with each other as Cash's drug problem gets out of control, and eventually agree to marry one another in a great scene where Cash proposes on stage in a show in Canada.It's great seeing how Cash became famous for his singing, and we also see greats he is travelling with such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley. I also found the scenes with Cash dressing up all in black and his performance inside the prison the best scene of them all, with Cash taking his hat off to the inmates who have to drink horrid, brown looking water.This is one movie you need to see to understand how great it really is. Phoenix and Witherspoon are fantastic, the singing is wonderful, and the entertainment is off the charts.Extras:10 deleted scenescommentary by James Mangold, the co writer and director of the moviePlus More!",4,4 and a half stars for one memorable movie...,1144368000,"04 7, 2006",2006,2497,"['Line', 'legendary', 'singer', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'impressive', 'career', 'movie', 'will', 'keep', 'entertained', 'start', 'finish', 'will', 'only', 'make', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'again', 'good', 'stars', 'Joaquin', 'Pheonix', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'portraying', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'wife', 'June', 'Carter', 'movie', 'filled', 'powerhouse', 'performances.Walk', 'Line', 'unique', 'entertaining', 'singers', 'actually', 'sing', 'own', 'songs', 'instead', 'editing', 'Cash', 'own', 'voice', 'movie', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'took', 'singing', 'lessons', 'really', 'shines', 'music', 'scenes', 'audiences', 'movies', 'Pheonix', 'can', 'sing', 'too', 'crowds', 'going', 'so', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'tap', 'foot', 'music.The', 'acting', 'great', 'also', 'character', 'bit', 'movie', 'make', 'feel', 'were', 'witnessing', 'Cash', 'life', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'young', 'man', 'great', 'scenes', 'have', 'starting', 'sing', 'record', 'company', 'sing', 'problems', 'air', 'force', 'lifestyles.The', 'movie', 'Cash', 'young', 'man', 'back', 'Arkansas', 'who', 'noticed', 'unique', 'voice', 'how', 'sang', 'different', 'topics', 'normally', 'would', 'create', 'controversy', 'disbelief', 'people', 'life', 'turn', 'stardom', 'tour', 'country', 'up', 'June', 'Carter', 'who', 'later', 'relationshp', 'with.Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'was', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'great', 'fan', 'who', 'talked', 'went', 'way', 'start', 'conversation', 'anyone', 'who', 'asked', 'autograph', 'Cash', 'had', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'fall', 'other', 'become', 'disgusted', 'other', 'Cash', 'drug', 'problem', 'control', 'eventually', 'agree', 'marry', 'one', 'great', 'scene', 'where', 'Cash', 'stage', 'show', 'Canada.It', 'great', 'seeing', 'how', 'Cash', 'became', 'famous', 'singing', 'also', 'see', 'greats', 'travelling', 'such', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'also', 'found', 'scenes', 'Cash', 'dressing', 'up', 'black', 'performance', 'prison', 'best', 'scene', 'Cash', 'taking', 'hat', 'inmates', 'who', 'have', 'drink', 'horrid', 'brown', 'looking', 'water.This', 'one', 'movie', 'need', 'see', 'understand', 'how', 'great', 'really', 'Phoenix', 'Witherspoon', 'are', 'fantastic', 'singing', 'wonderful', 'entertainment', 'charts.Extras:10', 'deleted', 'scenescommentary', 'James', 'Mangold', 'co', 'writer', 'director', 'moviePlus', 'More']",Walk the Line

And, while the cinema realite is very internal, I think the end of the film was wanting, because Mangold chose to ignore Cash's Nickajack Cave incident, which was his lowest point and his struggle with God... and as a result, it missed Cash's epiphanic moment.One thing Hollywood won't get is the heart of evangelical religion.Cash took it all to the edge to show that life is a messy conflux.

637658,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JO1R,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 3]","""Walk the Line"" is a good film with very good performances.Virtually every great artist has one thing in common. At some point in their life, they abused alcohol, drugs, the opposite sex, their lover(s), their children, themselves, friendships or a combination of any of the above. In many cases, they overcame these problems to go on and create even more outstanding work, cementing their reputations in history. For a few of these people, the problems proved too much, bringing a premature end to a promising life. Hollywood executives recognize that either scenario is pretty much guaranteed to help create an interesting film because each is inherently filled with drama. Therefore, it stands to reason that any biopic of a musician will feature the same element, the lead character overcoming an obstacle. Without this, the story wouldn't be as interesting.Because we know that a biopic of a musician is going to feature a struggle, of some type, some of the inherent drama dissipates. It would, after all, be boring to watch a film about an artist who has a great life, no problems, everything is rosy. Fortunately, the last few musician biopics have married their familiar stories with great performances and good to great directing, enhancing our appreciation of their life. Last year's ""Ray"" features an outstanding performance by Jamie Foxx, who brings the character to life, with the aid of director Taylor Hackford.If ""Walk the Line"", the new biopic about Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash, were made a few years from now, there would be fewer comparisons to the Ray Charles film. But as it comes on the heels, comparisons are inevitable and will be plentiful.Joaquin Phoenix does a good job of bringing singer Johnny Cash to life. He doesn't really attempt to imitate the icon as much as interpret his life. At times, especially when singing, Phoenix's voice attains the deep, resonant timber of Cash's, but he doesn't walk around mimicking throughout. This seems entirely natural. When he is performing, singing, his stage persona is different, selling himself as a character to his adoring fans.At times, I found myself thinking ""Wow, Joaquin Phoenix is doing a good job."" More often than not, Phoenix was doing a good job acting. Phoenix acts, he doesn't become. Because we are pulled out of the performance like this, recognizing his work as an actor, he doesn't completely transform himself into the singer. Jamie Foxx managed this on a much more consistent basis, transforming himself into Ray Charles. He became the singer, losing himself in the mannerisms, speech and actions of the singer. In a way, Foxx was mimicking Charles, but he was doing this so completely and successfully he got lost in the character.Remarkably, Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did all of their own singing and this is where Phoenix really shines. As mentioned, his voice reaches a deeper timber, reminiscent of the singer's and it is difficult to tell that it isn't Cash singing. I am not overly familiar with the Johnny Cash songbook, but when Phoenix sings, the signature tunes sure sound authentic.Reese Witherspoon plays June Carter, the love of Johnny Cash's life. I think people are generally much less familiar with her life and her work, so Witherspoon has a great deal more latitude in her performance, building a three dimensional character. Because she is able to more fully become ""June Carter"", her character is more successful. Witherspoon brings all of the facets of June's life to the screen; she conveys her conflicts with her religion when she gets divorced (for the first time), she conveys her friendship for Johnny, her ability to help him through his addiction, her onstage persona and more.Reese Witherspoon also does her own vocals throughout. In Witherspoon's case, it is easier to tell that it is the actress singing. Her voice doesn't change and you recognize her accent throughout. I can honestly say I wouldn't recognize a song sung by the real June Carter Cash, so I have nothing to compare her vocal abilities to, but she also sounds good.The two performances are very good, but it is strange that the actor portraying the less recognizable person should be more successful. Both actors are probably doing comparable work, but because we know more about Johnny Cash, recognize him as an icon, Phoenix has to work harder to make his performance seem interesting, believable and real. Ultimately, Phoenix does a better job with the singing and Witherspoon does a better job with her acting.The film opens with inmates at Folsom Prison chanting and stomping their feet, trying to get Cash to come back from a break and continue the concert. As Cash pauses, trying to relax, he remembers back to his childhood. This is a fairly conventional setup for a biopic. Many recent film biographies wisely chose to depict only a portion of the subject's life, concentrating on this period, going into more depth. In ""Walk the Line"", the majority of the film tells the story of Cash's life from twelve year old cotton picker to his performance at Folsom Prison. The performance at Folsom provides a natural climax for the film and his story. And it is a great sequence, with Phoenix channeling the spirit of Johnny Cash, but the real point of this story is the romance between Johnny and June, so the film continues on for a bit until June finally agrees to marry Johnny. This is an interesting moment, and the two clearly loved one another, but the film really should've ended with the performance at Folsom. Continuing on, it seems anticlimactic.Director James Mangold does a good, if unspectacular job with the material. Yes, everything looks good, but the film doesn't match the quality of the performances from the two leads. Mangold's work is a bit disappointing because the film is a really straightforward biopic. The director's previous work includes ""Identity"", a really underrated thriller with a twist, and ""Heavy"", his first film, also an underrated independent film. With the exception of the turkey ""Kate and Leopold"", Mangold's earlier work contains elements that help it rise above the pack. He has shown that he isn't content simply making a big budget studio picture. In ""Walk the Line""; he pretty much leaves the visual elements alone, photographing everything in a very straight forward and simple way. Everything looks good, but it doesn't contain any artistic flair.Also, there are more than a few scenes involving Johnny, June and a number of other rising musicians touring on the same circuit. These rising musicians included Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, Merle Haggard, Carl Perkins and Roy Orbison. Jerry Lee Lewis is given the most screen time of the group and the actor playing him, Waylon Payne, seems to have a lot of fun bringing the outrageous musician to life. The remainder of the group sticks mainly to the sidelines, offering brief glimpses of them before and after they perform. Because we see so little of them, except for a few of the familiar iconic trademarks of Presley and Orbison, they seem to be almost cartoon characters, they serve as distractions, pulling us out of the story every time they appear. Cash says something to Elvis as they pass during a concert, then Cash stops to watch Elvis perform for a few moments. Then our attention is drawn to the audience is looking at Elvis on stage and the actor playing him. ""Oh, so he knew Elvis..."" At this point, it takes a few moments to get lost in the film again. It would have been better to actually never see these characters, maybe only catching glimpses of them, from the wings, or from behind, the bright stage lights obscuring their features.A biopic should teach you something significant about the subject's life, something you didn't already know. Because ""Walk the Line"" is about two people, we should learn something about both of the characters. Ultimately, we learn more about June Carter, through Witherspoon's performance, partly because of the actor's work and partly because we know less about Johnny Cash's true love than we do about the iconic singer.",4,"One Actor Walks ""Through Fire"", The Other ""Walks The Line""",1132531200,"11 21, 2005",2005,8084,"['Walk', 'Line', 'good', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'performances.Virtually',

Reese Witherspoon as June Carter does a nice turn in the acting department too but she is required to be subtle and, while not played as completely in Cash's shadow, largely is in his shadow for the crux of the movie.  I found the drama to be earthy and not transcendent (I suppose I expected a bit more of the transcendence) but that is probably because it doesn't take you up close to the end of Cash's life.  It really focuses on Cash growing up and starting out and the tumultuous relationship that he initially shared with June Carter.

However I was interested enough to want to see the movie and intrigued to see Reese W live out her childhood dream of being a country singer.Wow.It's a long movie but I hardly noticed. Some really truly great acting from both leads - a magnificent supporting cast. A compelling, dramatic, and moving story of redemption.Of necessity the film focuses on a relatively short period of Cash and Carter's life and the genesis of their relationship, but it whets the appetite to find out more about the man and his music. I think it actually works a good deal better than if they had tried to fit his whole life in - it's a snapshot, which has enabled the filmmakers to really get into the story, not skim over things too much.Witherspoon and Phoenix both put in quite amazing vocal performances. Phoenix in particular beautifully portrays Johnny's journey from wannabe gospel singer nervously trying out his own song for a producer right up to the confident rock star with the inmates of Folsom putty in his hands. Acting, singing and playing wise both actors give it their all, and the supporting actors who learned to sing and singers who learned to act all come out smelling of roses.Some beautiful and some incredibly powerful scenes - those where June and her family walk Cash through withdrawal from drugs fitting neatly into both those categories and being some of my favourite parts of the film.One also mustn't forget the two young actors playing young JR and his brother, who really set up the film incredibly well - the opening scenes leading up to the death of his brother show that these two young actors are serious talent of the future and they do a beautiful job making real the close friendship that haunts the adult Cash throughout the rest of the film.I could seriously waffle on for ages, I have been so impressed by this movie. What can I say? It's a triumph. Do watch the deleted scenes and also the interesting and informative commentary (which gives the background to some scenes in the movie which in many cases you may otherwise think must have been elaborated on or made up).

637661,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00005JO1R,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[4, 4]","This Oscar winning movie is every bit as good as you may have heard. There isn't single wasted frame, and just about every performance is spot-on. But the movie belongs to its two leads. Joaquin Phoenix burns darkly as the young Johnny Cash. His immersion into the role of the troubled ""Man In Black"" matches that of Oscar Winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman's in ""Capote."" Even more fascinating is how Phoenix took the time to learn Cash's vocal mannerisms and record the songs for the movie. While Phoenix lacks Cash's low register gruffness, he still convinces as a singer. It really helps in the concert sequences, especially at the climactic legendary Folsom Prison performance.The same can be said for Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon, who continues to grow as an actress. As June Carter, she manages to blend warmth, spunk and humility as she lives a life that runs parallel to Cash's, even as Cash begins to fall victim to his demons. She comes to terms with Cash's ongoing advances, even as she keeps her distance from his drug addiction. And like Phoenix, she sang her parts for the soundtrack. The duet of ""Jackson"" will stop your clock...you'll pause to wonder if they are really singing or if they are miming to the original.The other singers in the cast are solid in their performances, but particular credit belongs to Waylon Malloy Payne as Jerry Lee Lewis, who plays The Killer as a mischief making imp with just a brief glimpse at his dark side. As Executive Music Producer, T-Bone Burnette does his usual remarkable job at keeping the soundtrack rootsy and authentic. There's great original songs included with Phoenix and Withersppoon's tracks, making sure that ""Walk The Line"" never loses that air of honesty. It cuts off when June agrees to marry Johnny in front of a live audience (essentially losing 35 years of story), but the one thing I can say to ""Walk The Line's"" benefit is that I didn't feel cheated. You'll come away from ""Walk The Line"" with a firm understanding of just why June and Johnny's marriage endured.",5,And it burns burns burns,1174262400,"03 19, 2007",2007,2036,"['Oscar', 'winning', 'movie', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'may', 'have', 'heard', ""n't"", 'single', 'wasted', 'frame', 'just', 'performance', 'spot-on', 'movie', 'two', 'leads', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'darkly', 'young', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'immersion', 'role', 'troubled', 'Man', 'Black', 'Oscar', 'Winner', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Capote', 'Even', 'more', 'fascinating', 'how', 'Phoenix', 'took', 'time', 'learn', 'Cash', 'vocal', 'mannerisms', 'record', 'songs', 'movie', 'Phoenix', 'Cash', 'low', 'register', 'gruffness', 'still', 'singer', 'really', 'concert', 'sequences', 'especially', 'climactic', 'legendary', 'Folsom', 'Prison', 'performance.The', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'who', 'grow', 'actress', 'June', 'Carter', 'blend', 'warmth', 'spunk', 'humility', 'life', 'parallel', 'Cash', 'even', 'Cash', 'fall', 'victim', 'demons', 'terms', 'Cash', 'ongoing', 'advances', 'even', 'distance', 'drug', 'addiction', 'Phoenix', 'sang', 'parts', 'soundtrack', 'duet', 'Jackson', 'will', 'stop', 'clock', ""'ll"", 'pause', 'wonder', 'are', 'really', 'singing', 'are', 'miming', 'original.The', 'other', 'singers', 'cast', 'are', 'solid', 'performances', 'particular', 'credit', 'belongs', 'Waylon', 'Malloy', 'Payne', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'who', 'Killer', 'mischief', 'making', 'imp', 'just', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'dark', 'side', 'Executive', 'Music', 'Producer', 'T-Bone', 'Burnette', 'usual', 'remarkable', 'job', 'keeping', 'soundtrack', 'rootsy', 'authentic', 'great', 'original', 'songs', 'included', 'Phoenix', 'Withersppoon', 'tracks', 'making', 'sure', 'Walk', 'Line', 'never', 'air', 'honesty', 'off', 'when', 'June', 'marry', 'Johnny', 'front', 'live', 'audience', 'essentially', 'losing', '35', 'years', 'story', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'Walk', 'Line', 'benefit', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'cheated', ""'ll"", 'come', 'away', 'Walk', 'Line', 'firm', 'understanding', 'just', 'why', 'June', 'Johnny', 'marriage', 'endured']",Walk the Line

637664,ALG7QH2L5JL2L,B00005JO1R,"T. Noever ""Author of the TETHYS series""","[3, 4]","Upfront declaration:1) I am a fan of Johnny Cash's music as much as I'll ever be a 'fan' of anything.2) I can't stand biopics.So I went to see this flick following the proddings of my offspring and wife, in the company of said wife.I want to say a few things that I think need to be added, because they were mostly missing from other reviews.The not-so-good-things:The beginning was rather 'bitsy'. Flashbacks to 'youth', meant to serve as exposition and also 'explanation' are very difficult to do, I know. I think they could have been done better. Not necessarily longer or shorter but just 'different'. They had a perfunctory air, like something that had to be gotten over and done with, but was done without much heart. The transition from the thump-thump-thump of the intro to Cash's youth was jarring, instead of stimulating or creating expectancy. It took me some time to recover my bearings and get 'with it' again--and I WAS 'with it' right at the beginning. The sense of things not working persisted for a good half hour into the movie.The second thing was the down-grading of the importance of Cash's first family. Did they ever matter to him at all? According to this script and implementation, not really. I wonder of this doing the situation justice. It certainly demeans Cash's character. Was he really that shallow, indifferent, selfish? I don't know. Who does? But the real question is, did the film makers intend that effect and impression? If so, they succeeded. If not, they screwed up badly.Now for the good things, which is much more fun:I don't think June Carter was quite the cute--though troubled and tough--little munchkin that Witherspoon portrays her as. But I think she and Phoenix managed to pull off very convincingly the love story that is at the heart of all of this. For it's not really about the music, nor about Cash's social conscience or whatever. It's just about a guy who grew up in troubled circumstances, and like all of us had to carry around the baggage through his life. He also had a 'calling', which not so many people have; or if they do they hardly ever listen.He did listen though and went to some lengths to follow it; and got sucked into the maelstrom of money and fame and all that jazz. Matters were made worse by the fact that a) his family, wife and parents alike, didn't really understand what a 'calling' is and how it can drive someone to do very odd things indeed, and b) it just so happened that the one woman marked against his name in the great scheme of life and the universe and everything was basically unattainable--and yet right across the room.Turns out, however, that, when all was said and done, the 'calling' and its fulfillment was empty without the one thing that really mattered. Still, it's not fair to say that June's rejection of him led Cash into drugs and near-ruin. He made some bad decisions, and part of her rejection was occasioned by those, and that in turn made him make more bad decisions. But that's just life. Thing is, in the end--and in reality, too, which makes a nice change--they did get together; and when she died, after 35 years together, he followed her less than half a year later. It's a very touching and romantic story, made even more touching because it isn't made up.The music? What about the music? Well, this is where the film just 'worked'; because the music paced it admirably and was put to very good use to convey emotion where the bracketing narrative sometimes failed. In fact I wish there had been more music and less narrative. The scope of the Cash/Carter repertoire is so wide that they could have added several judiciously-chosen songs and put the point across even more succinctly, especially in the duets.Phoenix and Witherspoon on the stage are dynamite. I know they're not really singers, and they're just imitating/representing a couple of people that actually lived--but there were some moments where I thought ""wow; they're actually better than the originals"". I know that's heresy, but what the heck! And isn't it really the ultimate tribute to Cash and Carter when the actors go out of their way to make it even better? I know they went to music boot-camp and all that, but so what? Everybody can learn things. Few will take what they've learned and make THIS out of it.I noted the down-playing of the religious angle of the Cash persona. That was a good decision, though I suspect it was taken more for Hollyweirdesque reasons--meaning venal motives--than out of a sense of story-telling integrity. In any case, there was just enough to point it out, but then just as quickly look away and focus on more important things. Way I see this--from an essentially atheist perspective--I think a person is better off, generally speaking, 'finding Jesus' than doing drugs. His chances of being a decent human being are definitely greater. If finding religion--next to finding June--is what it took to set Johnny Cash's life in order, that's fine with me.4/5 stars overall because of the occasionally-confused story line5/5 for Phoenix and

637667,A3N0E03AQD128O,B00005JO1R,Tony Thomas,"[12, 14]","This movie is a good work of fiction, based on the life of Johnnie Cash and June Carter.  You get drawn in and care about most of the characters, good or bad, because the acting is so excellent. The excellent acting is supported by a very well-crafted screen play with some wonderful lines and scenes. It's a treat if you like good acting. However, if you want the real story of Johnny Cash, you need to go elsewhere.For example, the film makes the central event in Cash's life the death of his brother Jack.  Indeed, the film opens with an adult performing Cash, pausing before he goes on at his historical Folsom prison show, paralyzed by seeing a circular saw like the one that alledgedly killed his brother.In this film Jack allegedly  sawing wood for a dollar about the age of 9 when Johnny is tagging along with him about the age of 6 or 7.  Jack tells little Johnnie to go on fishing and he will catch up. Jack has an accident and later dies.  Little Johnnie is not there, so his father reproaches him for. Dad heaps a lot of cruelty on this very young child. Guilt and angst over this clouds the rest of Cash's life and poisons Cash's relationship with his father. The pivotal scene in the movie is an adult confrontation between Johnnie and his father over this.However, this whole business was made up.  Cash's brother died in an accident in high school machine shop class!Johnnie's first wife Vivian is  a victim of this film. She's portrayed as a very conventional, Southern white wife, who is continually asking Johnny to forsake music to go and work in her father's business. She's quite at home with the Bible-Belt culture of Cash's attempts at a gospel career but seems just to be a conservative anti-music force.  The viewer thinks she wants Johnnie to go back to Arkansas's cotton country.However, Vivian Dorraine Liberto Cash was a Mexican-American. Cash wooed her while he was stationed in San Antonio in the US Air Force. At the time Vivian was a student at an all-girls Catholic high school. The film provides no information about the kind of culture and racial clash that Cash's having a Catholic, Mexican-American wife must have been in 1950s and early 1960s Arkansas and Tennesse.Instead, Vivian is potrayed as a conservative, money oriented, music hater in contrast to the wittier, more attractive, and more meaningful June Carter. Vivian is also pictured as a fairly unsophisticated looking house-wife type.  In fact, throughout their marriage, Vivian was very glamorous and attractively dressed and made up. She looked more like a movie star than June Carter whose main act until she hooked up with Cash was as a country girl corn pone comedian, a kind of younger version of Minnie Pearl.The truth is that Johnny Cash quite freely admitted that his marriage to Vivian ended only because of his own drug addiction, abuse, and unfaithfulness. Both Cash and Vivian Dorraine Liberto have said that they would never have parted except for Cash's drug addiction. As Cash said in the 1970s,""I have to take blame for that -- because no woman can live with a man who's strung out on amphetamines_Walk the Line_ says nothing about Cash's musical and political embrace of the changes in the 1960s as a result of the civil rights movement, the anti-Vietnam war struggle, and the youth radicalization.For example, in the mid 1960s as Cash recovered from addiction, many Country artists backed the right-wing pro-war ""Silent Majority"" cultural campaign against the movements for Black liberation, against the Vietnam War, and for native and prisoner's rights.  I can remember driving through Florida and Alabama seeing promoting then Nashville Super Stars George Jones and Tammy Wynette's appearances at rallies for George Wallace.Instead, Cash embraced the music made by the new generation and the political questioning that went on.  The film does picture him doing Bob Dylan's ""It Ain't me Babe"" and listening to Dylan's ""Highway 61.""  However, only a more-than middle aged music buff like me who remembers those songs and the controversy in Country music circles Cash's friendship and performances with Dylan caused can understand what's involved the way _Walk the Line- portrays it.Nothing is also said about Cash's championing of new-breed Nashville song writers like Kris Kristofferson. Cash's determination to perform Kris's ""Sunday Morning Coming Down"" with its references to being stoned on drugs despite NBC's attempt to censor the song was big news at the time.When Cash was first invited to the White House by Richard Nixon, Nixon asked him to sing an anti-welfare recipient song called ""Welfare Cadillac"" and Haggard's ""Okie from Muskogee,"" a song that had become an anthem for right wing culture war opponents of the changes of the 1960s, even though it was written as a parody of the ""silent majority,"" by a marijuana high Haggard while he band bus tooled through that Oklahoma town. Cash refused because he did not agree with the outlook of those songs.Cash's decision to dress all in black is pictured in _Walk the Line_ as just his choice one time when nothing else was available back in the 1950s.  Yet, his decision to wear black and his identification with it only came in the late 1960s.Cash always made it clear that he wore Black because he identified with the struggles of society's victims. He wrote a song explaining why he wore black which says: ""I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down, / Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town, / I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime, / But is there because he's a victim of the times.""_Walk the Line_ doesn't tell us about that Johnnie Cash.This movie's executive producer is John Carter Cash, the child of Johnnie Cash and June Carter Cash.  I guess to him the most important thing in Johnny's life was his parents getting together.  Otherwise, John Carter Cash wouldn't have been born!  Perhaps, this is why the film streamlines Cash's life down to a fictional romance between Johnnie and June.  Perhaps, his father's political and musical radicalism in the 1960s and 1970s is not to John Carter Cash's taste.Yet,  John Carter Cash and the people he worked with were able to find some great screen writers and an outstanding cast of actors.  They give remarkable performances that make this a worthwhile film, despite its distance from the truth.",3,"Good drama & acting, but if you want to know about Johnnie Cash's life, you need to go

I wouldn't be surprised if Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix receive Oscar nominations,not to mention a Best Picture nod for the film itself. Director James Mangold received acclaim for Cop Land (1997) and Girl, Interrupted (1999, in which Angelina Jolie won an Oscar for best supporting actress.)Phoenix's portrayal is understated and subtle as opposed to being over the top and flashy. It seemed realistic and heartfelt as he struggled through bittersweet moments. You see the tough upbringing he had with a drunken, cold and seemingly loveless father (Robert Patrick (1958), X-File's John Doggett and Terminator Two's T-1000). The friendship with his older brother ended due to tragedy and his father placed some of the blame on Johnny, who was fishing at the time. He felt guilty about this his whole life. Over sixty years later, Cash talked about how he looked forward to meeting his brother again in Heaven. His first marriage turned cold as his wife took little interest in his life on the road. At the same time, you he pinned for the lovely and divorced June Carter (1929), who constantly rebuffed him as he took to a life of popping pills, further digging himself into a pit of despair. Or a ring of fire. He used to listen to radio broadcasts of the Carter Family, which included a young June, in the 1940s.It's interesting to note that all the Johnny Cash and June Carter vocals were sung by Phoenix and Witherspoon. And they did play my favorite Cash tune, the crackling ""Jackson"", which won them a Grammy in 1967, in the Best Country & Western Performance, Duet, Trio Or Group (vocal or instrumental) category.One of my favorite scenes in the film was the audition for Sam Phillips (1923), owner of Sun Records, the seminal early roots and rock'n'roll label that helped launch Elvis, and Jerry Lee Lewis, among others. He gave honest feedback regarding the gospel song that Cash's band performed to try and get a deal. He asked Cash that if he was in a car wreck and had time to sing just one more song before he died, what would he sing? Cash to performed one of his non-gospel, from the heart songs, written while he was in the military, and this was the very first Johnny Cash recording, ""Hey Porter.""Until now, I have always thought of Reese Witherspoon as a credible but limited actress, a flyweight. This is arguably her best role and is a terrific performance. She's razor sharp and when she's on stage with Phoenix, she's totally convincing as a performer.If you ever wondered how Johnny Cash ended up recording Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison (1968), you get the explanation and see the resistance. For years, he received a ton of fan mail from inmates and incareated men, people who could relate to the songs about lawbreaking and the outlaw life.I couldn't help but feel sorry for Cash, due to certain scenes, especially ones involving his father. During one Thanksgiving at Cash's beautiful new house and waterfront acreage, his dad couldn't say a kind word but instead levelled criticism at his famous son, who, in 1969, was arguably the hottest act in the world, outselling even the Beatles. Meanwhile, it was apparent that Johnny Cash so desperately wanted his father's unconditional love, something that was long overdue.You do get to see Elvis Presley, Waylon Jennings and the Killer, Jerry Lee Lewis, but they in no way overshadow Cash in this story. You also get to see how Cash and June Carter had a chance to develop and solidify their friendship and love. They toured together with a few other artists, and later, together.True, this film is not unlike last year's Ray: poor boy grows up to eventually become hot young star, takes pills, does some womanizing, ends up in the slammer, eventually comes clean and lives out the rest of his life trouble-free.If you see this film, there's bound to be emotions that you can really relate to. Johnny Cash was a performer people truly identified with. He's hard his share of hard knocks, disappointments. His attempts to come to terms with his outlaw lifestyle in light of his strong spiritual beliefs, was what he sang about.",4,"Can you say ""Oscar time""?",1132272000,"11 18, 2005",2005,4293,"['4/', '5136', 'minutesreleased', 'November', '18', '2005Walk', 'Line', 'excellent', 'film', 'elevated', 'being', 'typical', 'biopic', 'stellar', 'cast', 'performances', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'receive', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'not', 'mention', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nod', 'film', 'Director', 'James', 'Mangold', 'received', 'acclaim', 'Cop', 'Land', '1997', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', '1999', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'Phoenix', 'portrayal', 'understated', 'subtle', 'opposed', 'being', 'top', 'flashy', 'seemed', 'realistic', 'heartfelt', 'struggled', 'through', 'bittersweet', 'moments', 'see', 'tough', 'upbringing', 'had', 'drunken', 'cold', 'seemingly', 'loveless', 'father', 'Robert', 'Patrick', '1958', 'X-File', 'John', 'Doggett', 'Terminator', 'Two', 'T-1000', 'friendship', 'older', 'brother', 'ended', 'due', 'tragedy', 'father', 'placed', 'blame', 'Johnny', 'who', 'was', 'fishing', 'time', 'felt', 'guilty', 'whole', 'life', 'sixty', 'years', 'later', 'Cash', 'talked', 'how', 'looked', 'forward', 'meeting', 'brother', 'again', 'Heaven', 'first', 'marriage', 'turned', 'cold', 'wife', 'took', 'little', 'interest', 'life', 'road', 'same', 'time', 'pinned', 'lovely', 'divorced', 'June', 'Carter', '1929', 'who', 'constantly', 'rebuffed', 'took', 'life', 'popping', 'pills', 'further', 'digging', 'pit', 'despair', 'ring', 'fire', 'used', 'listen', 'radio', 'broadcasts', 'Carter', 'Family', 'included', 'young', 'June', '1940s.It', 'interesting', 'note', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'June', 'Carter', 'vocals', 'were', 'sung', 'Phoenix', 'Witherspoon', 'did', 'play', 'favorite', 'Cash', 'tune', 'crackling', 'Jackson', 'won', 'Grammy', '1967', 'Best', 'Country', 'Western', 'Performance', 'Duet', 'Trio', 'Or', 'Group', 'vocal', 'instrumental', 'category.One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'film', 'was', 'audition', 'Sam', 'Phillips', '1923', 'owner', 'Sun', 'Records', 'seminal', 'early', 'roots', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'label', 'helped', 'launch', 'Elvis', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'others', 'gave', 'honest', 'feedback', 'regarding', 'gospel', 'song', 'Cash', 'band', 'performed', 'try', 'get', 'deal', 'asked', 'Cash', 'was', 'car', 'wreck', 'had', 'time', 'sing', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'song', 'died', 'what', 'would', 'sing', 'Cash', 'performed', 'one', 'non-gospel', 'heart', 'songs', 'written', 'was', 'military', 'was', 'very', 'first', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'recording', 'Hey', 'Porter', 'now', 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'credible', 'limited', 'actress', 'flyweight', 'arguably', 'best', 'role', 'terrific', 'performance', 'razor', 'sharp', 'when', 'stage', 'Phoenix', 'totally', 'convincing', 'performer.If', 'ever', 'wondered', 'how', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'ended', 'up', 'recording', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Folsom', 'Prison', '1968', 'get', 'explanation', 'see', 'resistance', 'years', 'received', 'ton', 'fan', 'mail', 'inmates', 'incareated', 'men', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'relate', 'songs', 'lawbreaking', 'outlaw', 'life.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Cash', 'due', 'certain', 'scenes', 'especially', 'ones', 'involving', 'father', 'one', 'Thanksgiving', 'Cash', 'beautiful', 'new', 'house', 'waterfront', 'acreage', 'dad', 'could', ""n't"", 'say', 'kind', 'word', 'instead', 'levelled', 'criticism', 'famous', 'son', 'who', '1969', 'was', 'arguably', 'hottest', 'act', 'world', 'outselling', 'even', 'Beatles', 'Meanwhile', 'was', 'apparent', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'so', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'father', 'unconditional', 'love', 'something', 'was', 'long', 'overdue.You', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'Waylon', 'Jennings', 'Killer', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'way', 'Cash', 'story', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'Cash', 'June', 'Carter', 'had', 'chance', 'develop', 'solidify', 'friendship', 'love', 'toured', 'together', 'few', 'other', 'artists', 'later', 'together.True', 'film', 'not', 'last', 'year', 'Ray', 'poor', 'boy', 'up', 'eventually', 'become', 'hot', 'young', 'star', 'pills', 'womanizing', 'up', 'slammer', 'eventually', 'clean', 'out', 'rest', 'life', 'trouble-free.If', 'see', 'film', 'bound', 'be', 'emotions', 'can', 'really', 'relate', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'was', 'performer', 'people', 'truly', 'identified', 'hard', 'share', 'hard', 'knocks', 'disappointments', 'attempts', 'come', 'terms', 'outlaw', 'lifestyle', 'light', 'strong', 'spiritual', 'beliefs', 'was', 'what', 'sang', 'about']",Walk the Line

637674,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JO1R,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","Two superb performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon make the bio-pic of Johnny Cash `Walk the Line' a highly engaging and absorbing drama about him and his love June Carter. Without two leads, the film might have become a shallow melodrama about music and love that you have seen on screen many times before. As it is, in spite of the weak supporting roles and several mistakes that betray the not-so-sure hand of the director James Mangold (`Girl, Interrupted'), 'Walk the Line' is a moving story about Johnny Cash and June Carter.Though the film is full of great Johnny Cash songs, `Walk the Line' is more about the long-time romance of a gifted musician, and like any romance with gifted musician, it is full of romance and emotional turmoil. The film begins with the tragic event that happened in the childhood of the artist (like `Ray'), but the real film starts when we meet Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, whose less restrained and moralistic attitude to life than that of his wife inevitably attract Johnny Cash.Johnny Cash songs sometimes reveal the troubled soul of sinner or criminal with the darkly engaging lyrics. Credible acting from Joaquin Phoenix and several episodes depicted in the film explain the reason for this darker nature of his songs, but still many things are left out. While his distant father (Robert Patrick) convincingly shows the reason for the guilt-ridden mind seen in his songs and himself, supporting characters like his mother, his first wife, and his children are relegated to near ciphers. Still the strong performance from Reese Witherspoon compensates for the occasional slack in the script.As a fan of oldies, it is good to see the legendary artists of Sun Label such as Jerry Lee Lewis or Roy Orbison again even though they are played by someone else. The director somehow thought that to cast real singers are a better idea than to cast actors, and we see Waylon Malloy Payne and Jonathan Rice as Lewis and Orbison. I know this is only a small flaw, but I wish for my favorite musicians' roles someone who really looks like them.But essentially `Walk the Line' is a film for Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, both perfectly in character as Johnny and June.

637675,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JO1R,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[5, 5]","Even though my father is a huge fan of Johnny Cash, I didn't really start to appreciate the man's genius until the last couple years I was in college. That's when I began to see and understand how great a performer and singer Johnny Cash was. The more I learn about the man and his life, the more I am drawn to him. Cash was a man whose music was able to cross all kinds of boundaries: rich and poor, minorities and white people, good citizens and those in jail. His songs (many of his most popular tunes he didn't write) touched people where they were.  They were rooted in the toil of daily living and in the grit and grind of humanity.WALK THE LINE is an excellent biopic about one segment of The Man in Black's life. The movie is not a full-fledged biography. Instead, it is a shorten tale of Cash's life that tells of the love story between John R. Cash and one June Carter.The movie opens with Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) preparing to go on stage at Folsom County Prison to make his comeback (which all the record producers say is impossible to do at a prison). He sees a table saw and is taken back to when he was a child growing up in rural Arkansas. The childhood segment does a couple of important things for the story line. One, it shows that even as a child Cash had an infatuation with June Carter (he listens to her and her family on the radio all the time and stares at her pictures in magazines).  Secondly, it shows that from an early age, Cash knew pain--pain which made him sing like no other, but which also eventually led to his addiction to pain killers.The movie flashes ahead from Cash's childhood to his brief stint in the service until he finally returns home and marries his sweetheart.  Cash is a man of vision, but his wife Vivian (played by the lovely Ginnifer Goodwin) wants John to give up his dream and settle down. Through perseverance and a lot of luck, Cash and his band have the opportunity to perform for Sam Phillips, the legendary owner of Sun Records who discovered not only Johnny Cash but Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis as well. Suddenly, Cash becomes a big star.However, the higher his star rises, the more mixed-up becomes his personal life. Wife Vivian is just not happy with Johnny on the road so much. Johnny becomes more and more addicted to pain killers and alcohol and his childhood infatuation with June Carter turns into full-fledged grown-up love, tinged with a lot of lust.  June Carter knows better and though she connects with Cash, she knows that until he gets his act together they can't be together. The movie follows the relationship between these two until they are eventually married after an on-and-off again courtship of almost decades.The acting in WALK THE LINE is some of the finest in any film this year. Joaquin Phoenix, who has a higher pitched voice than many, does an excellent job of recreating the essence of Johnny Cash's tone and timber (though the real Cash had a deeper baritone/bass).  Reese Witherspoon should be able to put to rest forever all those critics who said she was nothing more than a pretty face who had no talent because as close as Phoenix is to Cash, Witherspoon seems like a cloned version of a young June Carter. The two stars aren't the only ones to shine, because the supporting cast is just as good.The overall tone is somewhat serious because as much as this is a love story, it is a love story about two people who lived really screwed up lives (don't we all?).  That's one of the reasons the movie (like Cash's music) is so powerful; it's real and honest and can touch people where they are.Cash purists can find many faults with the film. There are points that some dramatic liberties are taken. Some characters are only represented one-sided. At times the film moves slow. Despite all this, none of these things really takes away from the film or from the life of Johnny Cash. Instead, the movie augments The Man in Black and illustrates why he was able to become admired by so many and a legend in his time.",5,And Love Abides.,1134518400,"12 14, 2005",2005,4004,"['Even', 'father', 'huge', 'fan', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'start', 'appreciate', 'man', 'genius', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'was', 'college', 'when', 'began', 'see', 'understand', 'how', 'great', 'performer', 'singer', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'was', 'more', 'learn', 'man', 'life', 'more', 'am', 'drawn', 'Cash', 'was', 'man', 'music', 'was', 'able', 'cross', 'kinds', 'boundaries', 'rich', 'poor', 'minorities', 'white', 'people', 'good', 'citizens', 'jail', 'songs', 'many', 'most', 'popular', 'tunes', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'touched', 'people', 'where', 'were', 'were', 'rooted', 'toil', 'daily', 'living', 'grit', 'grind', 'LINE', 'excellent', 'biopic', 'one', 'segment', 'Man', 'Black', 'life', 'movie', 'not', 'full-fledged', 'biography', 'Instead', 'shorten', 'tale', 'Cash', 'life', 'tells', 'love', 'story', 'John', 'R.', 'Cash', 'one', 'June', 'Carter.The', 'movie', 'Cash', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'preparing', 'go', 'stage', 'Folsom', 'County', 'Prison', 'make', 'comeback', 'record', 'producers', 'say', 'impossible', 'do', 'prison', 'table', 'saw', 'taken', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'growing', 'up', 'rural', 'Arkansas', 'childhood', 'segment', 'couple', 'important', 'things', 'story', 'line', 'One', 'that', 'even', 'child', 'Cash', 'had', 'infatuation', 'June', 'Carter', 'family', 'radio', 'time', 'stares', 'pictures', 'magazines', 'Secondly', 'early', 'age', 'Cash', 'knew', 'pain', 'pain', 'made', 'sing', 'other', 'also', 'eventually', 'led', 'addiction', 'pain', 'killers.The', 'movie', 'flashes', 'ahead', 'Cash', 'childhood', 'brief', 'stint', 'service', 'finally', 'home', 'marries', 'sweetheart', 'Cash', 'man', 'vision', 'wife', 'Vivian', 'played', 'lovely', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'John', 'give', 'up', 'dream', 'settle', 'down', 'perseverance', 'lot', 'luck', 'Cash', 'band', 'have', 'opportunity', 'perform', 'Sam', 'Phillips', 'legendary', 'owner', 'Sun', 'Records', 'who', 'discovered', 'not', 'only', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Elvis', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'as', 'well', 'Suddenly', 'Cash', 'big', 'star.However', 'higher', 'star', 'rises', 'more', 'mixed-up', 'becomes', 'personal', 'life', 'Wife', 'Vivian', 'just', 'not', 'happy', 'Johnny', 'road', 'so', 'much', 'Johnny', 'more', 'more', 'addicted', 'pain', 'killers', 'alcohol', 'childhood', 'infatuation', 'June', 'Carter', 'full-fledged', 'grown-up', 'love', 'tinged', 'lot', 'lust', 'June', 'Carter', 'better', 'Cash', 'act', 'together', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'together', 'movie', 'relationship', 'two', 'are', 'eventually', 'married', 'on-and-off', 'again', 'courtship', 'almost', 'decades.The', 'acting', 'WALK', 'THE', 'LINE', 'finest', 'film', 'year', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'who', 'higher', 'pitched', 'voice', 'many', 'excellent', 'job', 'recreating', 'essence', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'tone', 'timber', 'real', 'Cash', 'had', 'deeper', 'baritone/bass', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'put', 'rest', 'forever', 'critics', 'who', 'said', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'pretty', 'face', 'who', 'had', 'talent', 'as', 'close', 'Phoenix', 'Cash', 'Witherspoon', 'cloned', 'version', 'young', 'June', 'Carter', 'two', 'stars', 'are', ""n't"", 'only', 'ones', 'shine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'just', 'good.The', 'overall', 'tone', 'somewhat', 'serious', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'story', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'really', 'screwed', 'up', 'lives', 'do', ""n't"", 'one', 'reasons', 'movie', 'Cash', 'music', 'so', 'powerful', 'real', 'honest', 'can', 'touch', 'people', 'where', 'are.Cash', 'purists', 'can', 'find', 'many', 'faults', 'film', 'are', 'points', 'dramatic', 'liberties', 'are', 'taken', 'characters', 'are', 'only', 'represented', 'one-sided', 'times', 'film', 'moves', 'slow', 'none', 'things', 'really', 'away', 'film', 'life', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Instead', 'movie', 'Man', 'Black', 'why', 'was', 'able', 'become', 'admired', 'so', 'many', 'legend', 'time']",Walk the Line

It has funny moments and also very sad moments. It also shows the downside of showbiz and drug addiction. But it also is inspriring in the story of June and John's love. Also Robert Patrick was excellent as Johnny's father Ray Cash and it really showed Patrick as a very good actor.

Although I am not a country music fan, I have always had a certain amount of respect for Johnny Cash because he was his own man, a true original, and this persona came across in his songs. This element comes through nicely in Walk the Line.Joaquin Phoenix gives a magnificent performance in the role of Cash, even getting the accent right. Reese Witherspoon, in the role of June Carter, also gives an electrifying performance. The two are dynamite together on the screen.Most of the film focuses on Cash's musical career from its beginnings in 1955 to his concert at Folsom State Prison in 1969. As other reviewers have pointed out, we are only given a very short account of Johnny's childhood and teenage years - but from what we are presented with, Cash had to struggle and scrap for everything he earned.What I found most interested about Walk the Line is that it does not attempt to glorify, romanticize, or heroify Johnny Cash in any way. Instead, the director presents with all aspects of the country music legend's life: the good, the bad, and the ugly. ""The man in black"" was a dedicated musician and songwriter, and was totally loyal to his fans...but his musical career encompassed so much of his life that his marriage suffered, and he eventually turned to alcohol and drugs to cope with mounting pressure.The concert scenes with Phoenix and Witherspoon on stage will make you crank your volume to the max.

Despite a creditable job as Cash by Joaquin Phoenix, I don't think he reaches the heights that either Jamie Foxx does as Ray Charles or Sissy Spacek as Loretta Lynn (if you like country music and have never seen ""Coal Miner's Daughter,"" watch that before ""Walk the Line""). That's probably because the real Johnny Cash just plain had a quirky inimitable voice, one impossible to get exactly right.Phoenix does a good job, though, and is even better at giving the character emotional depth than at singing (he's a very persuasive drug addict!). Witherspoon, for her part, is terrific at June Carter; her singing is surprisingly good, and she brings the right sass to the role. I was also impressed with Ginnifer Goodwin as Cash's first wife. Some of the other parts just didn't get fleshed out enough for the actors to take hold; for example, Dallas Roberts as the producer who first recorded Cash at Sun Records just isn't given space to expand his interpretation of this interesting character.I watched the deleted scenes and wished that many of the subplots could have been developed more fully, but of course the film had to keep its focus, which is on the love story.

637687,AHTEDRC5XLKK0,B00005JO1R,"WebViking ""WebViking""","[4, 4]","I tend to view biographical movies about recently deceased music celebrities with some trepidation because they tend to turn into overly reverrential epic sagas bordering on hero worship.  Worse, there have been such a slew of them over the years, Glen Miller, Buddy Holly, Jim Morrison, Richie Valens, and mostly recently Ray Charles have all had their lives re-interpreted in celluiloid.  Did we really need another about Johnny Cash?After watching the movie, I have to say that this is by far the best of the genre I have ever seen.  Joaquin Phoenix does an excellent job in his protrayal of Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon is transcendent as June Carter.  The film covers the period of Johnny Cash's life from his days of growing up during the depression on a cotton farm, to his service in the Air Force in the early 50's, his first records on the Sun label, to his prominance as a country music and American icon in the late 60's.Phoenix portrays Cash most appropriately as a simple man with a surprisingly complex edge.  Cash wanted to be married, wanted a family, yet probably never loved his first wife.  June Carter was also trapped in a series of doomed marriages when Cash first met her.  Their love for each other has to be one of the true great love stories of the 20th century.  The film ends with June Carter finally agreeing to marry Johnny Cash on stage in Ontario, Canada in 1968.  They stayed together until they passed away within four months of each other in 2003.The movie does a good job of capturing why Cash was so likable and became so loved by the public, and also why he was so unlikable and destructive to himself and the people around him.  A lot of that had to do with his addiction to amphetamines and barbituates, but a lot of it had to do with his childhood, and the death of his older brother.I have to mention the music in this movie, Cash was a contemporary of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins at the dawn of Rock and Roll and often toured with them.  Cash drew some influences from that, but was also deeply influenced by his mother's love of gospel music.  In the end Cash's music stood on it's own above any categorization of rock, country or gospel.  Something about a Johnny Cash song, the deep growling vocals and the incessant driving country beat just transcends labels, and the movie does an excellent job of making that point.Just a compelling movie about a simple yet complex man.  The movie doesn't make Johnny Cash into any more than what he was, a man with a gift to put hard feelings into song, but still a man with the same susceptablility to shortcomings as any man.  Great, well acted film with a good story.",5,The Man in Black,1172534400,"02 27, 2007",2007,2681,"['tend', 'view', 'biographical', 'movies', 'recently', 'deceased', 'music', 'celebrities', 'trepidation', 'tend', 'turn', 'overly', 'reverrential', 'epic', 'sagas', 'bordering', 'hero', 'worship', 'Worse', 'have', 'been', 'slew', 'years', 'Glen', 'Miller', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'Richie', 'Valens', 'mostly', 'recently', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'have', 'had', 'lives', 're-interpreted', 'celluiloid', 'Did', 'really', 'need', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'watching', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'far', 'best', 'genre', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'excellent', 'job', 'protrayal', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'transcendent', 'June', 'Carter', 'film', 'period', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'life', 'days', 'growing', 'up', 'depression', 'cotton', 'farm', 'service', 'Air', 'Force', 'early', '50', 'first', 'records', 'Sun', 'label', 'prominance', 'country', 'music', 'American', 'icon', 'late', ""60's.Phoenix"", 'portrays', 'Cash', 'most', 'appropriately', 'simple', 'man', 'surprisingly', 'complex', 'edge', 'Cash', 'wanted', 'be', 'married', 'wanted', 'family', 'yet', 'probably', 'never', 'loved', 'first', 'wife', 'June', 'Carter', 'was', 'also', 'trapped', 'series', 'doomed', 'marriages', 'when', 'Cash', 'first', 'met', 'love', 'other', 'be', 'one', 'true', 'great', 'love', 'stories', '20th', 'century', 'film', 'June', 'Carter', 'finally', 'agreeing', 'marry', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'stage', 'Ontario', 'Canada', '1968', 'stayed', 'together', 'passed', 'away', 'four', 'months', 'other', '2003.The', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'why', 'Cash', 'was', 'so', 'likable', 'became', 'so', 'loved', 'public', 'also', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'unlikable', 'destructive', 'people', 'lot', 'had', 'do', 'addiction', 'amphetamines', 'barbituates', 'lot', 'had', 'do', 'childhood', 'death', 'older', 'brother.I', 'have', 'mention', 'music', 'movie', 'Cash', 'was', 'contemporary', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'Carl', 'Perkins', 'dawn', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'often', 'toured', 'Cash', 'drew', 'influences', 'was', 'also', 'deeply', 'influenced', 'mother', 'love', 'gospel', 'music', 'end', 'Cash', 'music', 'stood', 'own', 'categorization', 'rock', 'country', 'gospel', 'Something', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'song', 'deep', 'growling', 'vocals', 'incessant', 'driving', 'country', 'beat', 'just', 'transcends', 'labels', 'movie', 'excellent', 'job', 'making', 'point.Just', 'compelling', 'movie', 'simple', 'yet', 'complex', 'man', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'man', 'gift', 'put', 'hard', 'feelings', 'song', 'still', 'man', 'same', 'susceptablility', 'shortcomings', 'man', 'Great', 'well', 'acted', 'film', 'good', 'story']",Walk the Line

637690,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B00005JO1R,Wesley Mullins,"[0, 0]","Haunted by memories of a tragedy from his dirt-poor childhood, he struggles in the music industry until he finds his niche and releases on the world a new, incendiary sound that mixes genres and redefines boundaries, all while battling drug addiction and searching for a woman who will make him feel whole.But enough about the Ray Charles movie, let's talk about Walk the Line.Johnny Cash is brought to life on screen by Joaquin Phoenix, whose performance out-Foxxes all recent depictions of true-life characters. Phoenix's portrayal finds strength in the actor's ability to pay just enough attention to looking and sounding like Cash without letting it overwhelm him. Other ""transformations"" of celebrities (Foxx's Charles, Blanchett's Hepburn) seem to be more akin to a Darryl Hammond impression on SNL, as they focus on mimicking the person's mannerisms and end up losing their own humanity.Playing Cash requires Phoenix not only to sing (which Foxx did not), but also to love someone so deeply that the absence of her love drives him to self destructive practices. In the song that leant its title to this film, Cash tells us he keeps a close watch on his heart. He builds walls and drapes himself in black, keeping the world away. While Phoenix captures this stand-offish outward presentation of Cash, he also opens him up, exposing the singer's vulnerabilities. The mysterious Man in Black loves. He cries. He lives.June Carter (Reece Witherspoon) haunts the first hour of the film. She is ever-present in Cash's life, but out of his reach; he listen to her on the radio as a young boy and reads about her first marriage while stationed in Germany. Clearly, the film's central story is their love, told from Johnny's point of view. Once June becomes a steady force in the film, the narrative moves from being the story of Johnny Cash to their courtship. Witherspoon brightens her scenes with a perky energy that masks an inner turmoil equal to Johnny's. On stage, Witherspoon bests Phoenix (a major feat, as he is fantastic) and has a career in country music if this acting thing doesn't work out.Walk the Line's supporting characters read like a Who's Who of 1950s music. Elvis, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, etc. The two scene-stealing performances belong to unknown actors (unknown to me) playing Jerry Lee Lewis and Sun Records proprietor Sam Phillips. Phillips' first meeting with Cash provides the heart of the film, as he tells the young musician to sing as if he only has the chance to sing one song for the rest of his life. Phillips is rightly presented as a man who nurtured many young musicians and helped them find the voices that spoke to the masses.My only criticism of the film is criticism I have for most biopics. I expect more from a film than just giving an account of someone's life (Ray, Ali, Man on the Moon). Those stories should be reserved for made-for-tv movies. Walk the Line has great ambitions when concerning the presentation of the material, but a lot of compromises are made on content. Much of the story-lines are clich&eacute;d, as real life has been heavily sculpted to fit a conventional drama (I seriously doubt Cash's father and first wife are as one-dimensional as presented).But Walk the Line does not have the goal of competing with most other dramas. Primarily, it wants to remain faithful to the love story of Johnny and June Carter Cash and present their lives' work in a way that will entertain modern audiences as much as the toe-tappers who listened to them half a century ago. With those goals in mind, this film could not be improved in any way.",5,Life ain't easy for a boy named Cash,1133654400,"12 4, 2005",2005,3598,"['Haunted', 'memories', 'tragedy', 'dirt-poor', 'childhood', 'music', 'industry', 'niche', 'releases', 'world', 'new', 'incendiary', 'sound', 'mixes', 'genres', 'redefines', 'boundaries', 'battling', 'drug', 'addiction', 'searching', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'whole.But', 'enough', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'movie', 'let', 'talk', 'Walk', 'Line.Johnny', 'Cash', 'brought', 'life', 'screen', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'performance', 'out-Foxxes', 'recent', 'depictions', 'true-life', 'characters', 'Phoenix', 'portrayal', 'strength', 'actor', 'ability', 'pay', 'just', 'enough', 'attention', 'looking', 'sounding', 'Cash', 'letting', 'overwhelm', 'Other', 'transformations', 'celebrities', 'Foxx', 'Charles', 'Blanchett', 'Hepburn', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'akin', 'Darryl', 'Hammond', 'impression', 'SNL', 'focus', 'mimicking', 'person', 'mannerisms', 'end', 'up', 'losing', 'own', 'humanity.Playing', 'Cash', 'Phoenix', 'not', 'only', 'sing', 'Foxx', 'did', 'not', 'also', 'love', 'someone', 'so', 'deeply', 'absence', 'love', 'self', 'destructive', 'practices', 'song', 'title', 'film', 'Cash', 'close', 'watch', 'heart', 'walls', 'drapes', 'black', 'keeping', 'world', 'away', 'Phoenix', 'stand-offish', 'outward', 'presentation', 'Cash', 'also', 'up', 'exposing', 'singer', 'vulnerabilities', 'mysterious', 'Man', 'Black', 'loves', 'Carter', 'Reece', 'Witherspoon', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'ever-present', 'Cash', 'life', 'reach', 'radio', 'young', 'boy', 'first', 'marriage', 'while', 'stationed', 'Germany', 'Clearly', 'film', 'central', 'story', 'love', 'told', 'Johnny', 'point', 'view', 'June', 'steady', 'force', 'film', 'narrative', 'moves', 'being', 'story', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'courtship', 'Witherspoon', 'scenes', 'perky', 'energy', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'equal', 'Johnny', 'stage', 'Witherspoon', 'Phoenix', 'major', 'feat', 'fantastic', 'career', 'country', 'music', 'acting', 'thing', ""n't"", 'work', 'out.Walk', 'Line', 'supporting', 'characters', 'read', 'Who', 'Who', '1950s', 'music', 'Elvis', 'Carl', 'Perkins', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'etc', 'two', 'scene-stealing', 'performances', 'belong', 'unknown', 'actors', 'unknown', 'playing', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'Sun', 'Records', 'proprietor', 'Sam', 'Phillips', 'Phillips', 'first', 'meeting', 'Cash', 'heart', 'film', 'young', 'musician', 'sing', 'only', 'chance', 'sing', 'one', 'song', 'rest', 'life', 'Phillips', 'rightly', 'presented', 'man', 'who', 'nurtured', 'many', 'young', 'musicians', 'helped', 'find', 'voices', 'spoke', 'masses.My', 'only', 'criticism', 'film', 'criticism', 'have', 'most', 'biopics', 'expect', 'more', 'film', 'just', 'giving', 'account', 'someone', 'life', 'Ray', 'Ali', 'Man', 'Moon', 'stories', 'should', 'be', 'reserved', 'made-for-tv', 'movies', 'Walk', 'Line', 'great', 'ambitions', 'when', 'concerning', 'presentation', 'material', 'lot', 'compromises', 'are', 'made', 'content', 'Much', 'story-lines', 'are', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'real', 'life', 'been', 'heavily', 'sculpted', 'fit', 'conventional', 'drama', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'Cash', 'father', 'first', 'wife', 'are', 'as', 'one-dimensional', 'presented', '.But', 'Walk', 'Line', 'not', 'have', 'goal', 'competing', 'most', 'other', 'dramas', 'Primarily', 'remain', 'faithful', 'love', 'story', 'Johnny', 'June', 'Carter', 'Cash', 'present', 'lives', 'work', 'way', 'will', 'entertain', 'modern', 'audiences', 'as', 'much', 'toe-tappers', 'who', 'listened', 'century', 'ago', 'goals', 'mind', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'improved', 'way']",Walk the Line

637693,A3Q9ZCPHHXYLWK,B00005JO1R,Windy City Dweller,"[1, 1]","Synthesized music, MTV and ""American Idol"" made music more of a visual package and experience.  In the 1960s and early '70s, the quality of a voice and a haunting melody created an intimate feeling between the vocalist and listener.  Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, Aretha Franklin, Patsy Cline or Sinatra could stand solo on a stage, clutchi a guitar or hold a mike and mesmerize audiences.  That's talent, raw, pure and clear.  Cash's low, melodious and soulful voice can raise goosebumps on the flesh.As far as the film's concerned, the performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon dazzle.  Phoenix is a marvel, capturing the essence of Cash's intensity, ambition and pain.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman was extraordinary in ""Capote"" too, and it's a tie as to who deserved the Oscar in 2005.  The comparisons to ""Ray"" are understandable, I suppose, but if one were to remove Jamie Foxx's performance from ""Ray,"" the movie would deflate fast.  Somehow, all the performances in ""Walk the Line"" seem credible, real, not as Hollywood-coated.In ""Walk the Line,"" the chemistry between June Carter and Johnny Cash snaps and sizzles.  She's wary but attracted, aware she's made her own marital mistakes and reluctant to plunge into another ill-fated relationship.  He's always admired her from afar and has followed her Carter Family career.  When they meet backstage, he's immediately physically captivated.  But the surface appeal goes deeper.  June is undeniably female, favoring dangling earrings, heels and dresses, but she's grounded, smart and confident.  He also finds out, she won't tolerate a boor.Certainly, there's the element that June carries qualities of his beloved older brother, the one who was tragically killed.  His older brother acted as a sane, gentle buffer, helping to soften a childhood of backbreaking labor and a harsh father.Considering Phoenix played a calculating, spoiled emperor's son in ""Gladiator,"" he's spectacular as Johnny Cash.  As for Witherspoon, she had me at hello, or the moment her dress caught in his guitar strap.  She's got real dimension, flexing her acting muscles as an anal-ambitious wunderkind in ""Election"" and elevating the traditional ditzy blonde in ""Legally Blonde.""  Her intelligence and perceptiveness shine through.When I watch male-female relationships on screen, I prefer seeing a balance of power.  I like seeing partnerships.  Sure, Johnny Cash was the icon, June didn't have his baritone voice or charisma.  Seldom are partnerships an identical match of talent and skills.

The main appeal of Walk the Line for me is to see the performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon whom I have followed since Legally Blonde. I am not even familiar with any of Johnny Cash's music, and yet I was so dazzled by the singing of his songs done by Phoenix, especially that ""Ring of Fire"" song near the end. To my surprise, I was very taken by Phoenix' mesmerizing performance that actually moved me to tears during the time when his character was down and out and recovering from drug addiction. The love and marriage proposal scene was also very touching.This film chronicles the early struggle and triumphs of Cash's life and career as a rebellious country musician in the '50s and '60s. He had three children with his first wife Vivian, but they got divorced dued to his wild and irresponsible behaviors. June Carter(Witherspoon) was the love his life, and it took many years before he pursuaded her to marry him. In the late '50s Cash was at the top of his game, but his drug addiction eventually caused the downfall of his career. His father(Robert Patrick in heavy makeup to look older) alienated him because he blamed him for the death of second son. It had casted shadows over Cash's life ever since. June and Johnny were the best musician duo/lovers and they were destined to become lifelong partners, despite the lack of social acceptances since they had been married to other people previously.Both Withspoon and Phoenix did their own singing and were pretty convincing. It was very natural for Withspoon to deliver her lines in an authentic southern accent. Her June Carter rendition stole numerous scenes and it's certainly her most impressive performance to date. Too bad her role is more of a major supporting role, which limits her chances of getting an Oscar nomination in the best actress cateogory. As for Phoenix, he had obviously transcended the emotions from the death of his brother River into several of the scenes in this film which made it even more powerful and real. He may not become the front runner for the Oscar this year, but a nomination is sure thing.",4,Phoenix and Witherspoon Cashing in their Oscar-caliber performances!,1132704000,"11 23, 2005",2005,2205,"['must', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'Country', 'Western', 'music', 'fan', 'do', 'love', 'biopics', 'well', 'made', 'main', 'appeal', 'Walk', 'Line', 'see', 'performances', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'whom', 'have', 'followed', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'am', 'not', 'even', 'familiar', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'music', 'yet', 'was', 'so', 'dazzled', 'singing', 'songs', 'done', 'Phoenix', 'especially', 'Ring', 'Fire', 'song', 'end', 'surprise', 'was', 'very', 'taken', 'Phoenix', 'mesmerizing', 'performance', 'actually', 'moved', 'tears', 'time', 'when', 'character', 'was', 'down', 'recovering', 'drug', 'addiction', 'love', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'scene', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'touching.This', 'film', 'early', 'struggle', 'triumphs', 'Cash', 'life', 'career', 'rebellious', 'country', 'musician', ""'50s"", ""'60s"", 'had', 'three', 'children', 'first', 'wife', 'Vivian', 'got', 'divorced', 'dued', 'wild', 'irresponsible', 'behaviors', 'June', 'Carter', 'Witherspoon', 'was', 'love', 'life', 'took', 'many', 'years', 'pursuaded', 'marry', 'late', ""'50s"", 'Cash', 'was', 'top', 'game', 'drug', 'addiction', 'eventually', 'caused', 'downfall', 'career', 'father', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'heavy', 'makeup', 'look', 'older', 'alienated', 'blamed', 'death', 'second', 'son', 'had', 'casted', 'shadows', 'Cash', 'life', 'ever', 'June', 'Johnny', 'were', 'best', 'musician', 'duo/lovers', 'were', 'destined', 'become', 'lifelong', 'partners', 'lack', 'social', 'acceptances', 'had', 'been', 'married', 'other', 'people', 'previously.Both', 'Withspoon', 'Phoenix', 'did', 'own', 'singing', 'were', 'pretty', 'convincing', 'was', 'very', 'natural', 'Withspoon', 'deliver', 'lines', 'authentic', 'southern', 'accent', 'June', 'Carter', 'rendition', 'stole', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'certainly', 'most', 'impressive', 'performance', 'date', 'Too', 'bad', 'role', 'more', 'major', 'supporting', 'role', 'chances', 'getting', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'best', 'actress', 'cateogory', 'Phoenix', 'had', 'obviously', 'transcended', 'emotions', 'death', 'brother', 'River', 'several', 'scenes', 'film', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'real', 'may', 'not', 'become', 'front', 'runner', 'Oscar', 'year', 'nomination', 'sure', 'thing']",Walk the Line
