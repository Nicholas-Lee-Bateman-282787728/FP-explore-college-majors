192501,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,1578480019,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 3]","""Werewolf"" is a terrible movie.And I don't mean that it's just your average run-of-the-mill bad movie, like ""Transformers"" or Lifetime weepies. Tony Zarindast's tale of lycanthropy and stupidity is a sloppy, ineptly-assembled pile of FAIL from the first scene to the last, with acting worthy of a Razzie and a plot apparently dreamed up during a bad hangover. No wonder the guys from Mystery Science Theater 3000 lampooned this one.Somewhere in the Southwest, a group of archaeologists (who look more like a biker gang) find what seems to be a human skeleton with a canine head. After a random brawl over it, their leader decides (without even verifying that the skeleton is REAL) that obviously this is the skeleton of a werewolf (or as Natalie calls it, a ""wur-wilf""). Unfortunately, one member of their party got injured on the skeleton, and turned into a... bear in a bad Halloween mask.And to make matters worse, the designated evil scientist Yuri (Jorge Rivero) decides to experiment by infecting random people with lycanthropy. For some reason if you turn into a werewolf in a car, you keep driving. At the same time, some greasy-looking guy called Paul (Federico Cavalli) comes to town, where he stays at the house of Fidel Castro's scruffier-looking brother. During a brawl with Yuri over Natalie (the wooden Adrianna Miles), he gets pricked by the wur-wilf's teeth and undergoes the usual transformation.I tried my absolute hardest to find SOMETHING in ""Wurwilf""... I mean, ""Werewolf"" that was actually worth watching. I came up empty. The acting, the scripting, the hairstyles (they keep changing!), unfinished storylines (what happens to the Indian guy?), continuity (is it a skinwalker or a wurwilf?! Which one?!), the wurwilf prosthetics, even the SOUNDTRACK are devastatingly awful and distractingly lame.And I can only assume that Zarindast had A) no money and B) no actual experience with human beings, because the entire film is filled with bizarre and random scenes that are apparently meant to drum up some drama, but actually leave you goggling at the sheer stupidity of it all (since when do archaeologists get into brawls over fossils? Why can't that girl run across an ankle-deep mud puddle?). As for the dialogue, we get Shakespearean gems like ""It's like a nightmare. It was a nightmare. I was running in the streets... doing ""things!"" Oh really?And it gets worse in the second half: a guy who creeps TOWARD the werewolf that is menacing him, then starts ""praying for the police!"" (wouldn't it be better to call them?). Not to mention a guy who turns into a werewolf while... having sex with his bed. It makes you wonder what Zarindast was smoking.As for the acting, it basically runs from wooden to ""the emotive qualities of a cinder block."" Rivero seems to be disgusted by everything he's doing, and frankly I can't blame him. Miles spends the entire movie talking in a mutated Russian/Mexican/American-Southern accent, and her acting ability is displayed every time she puts on a tight shirt (""This is absolutely fascinating"").  As for Cavalli, he looks and acts like the sort of guy who probably has a dozen ex-wives and twice as many restraining orders.... and did I mention he has sex with his headboard?It's a good thing that Mystery Science Theater spoofed ""Werewolf"" because except for the mockery there is literally nothing worth watching in this steaming heap of alleged horror.

192504,AR61Y2VWLST1V,1578480019,"Holly Apollyon ""Messiah of Regret and Entropy""","[17, 17]","Uhgggh. This movie was just horrible. It begins where a crew of excavators unearths the skeleton of a werewolf in the Arizona desert. The fakest skeleton I've ever seen,loaded up with all kinds of knobby growths and claws.... The skull actually has bone ears growing from it---BONE EARS---I guess just in case you forget that it's a werewolf skeleton. Anyway, all you have to do is get scratched by the skeleton, and you turn into a werewolf!!! Like within twenty minutes. Oh dear God. One of the excavators, this withered, batrachian-looking creep named Yuri, decides, for no reason whatsoever, to run around and scratch people with the skeleton, thus making more werewolves. This scheme elevates him to the status of one of the guest villains from Josie and the Pussycats---and I think that in a fight the Pussycats would take Yuri down in round one.At one point, Yuri drugs a security guard, then, I guess, infects him somehow. So the security guard wakes up, and walks out in the parking lot to his car. Along the way he starts growing hair and fangs, and doesn't even notice. He gets in his car, and drives off, while he continues to transform. Both of his hands stay on the steering wheel, and his driving doesn't seem to suffer AS HE TURNS INTO A WEREWOLF. HE DOES NOT NOTICE HIS OWN FUR-TUFTED CLAWED HANDS AT THE WHEEL! AND HIS HAT STAYS ON HIS HEAD THROUGHOUT THE TRANSFORMATION. I've almost wrecked my car dropping cigarette butts in my lap, and this guy turns into a hairy demon and doesn't even miss a stop sign.As all of this occurs, Yuri is driving behind the guard, watching and grinning gleefully, though he is in a car three hundred yards behind the guard, it's night, and he can see nothing, he's still grinning like he just got lucky with a prom queen.

But never fear, I did see all the 'good parts', which I will be sure to list in a moment. So, consider this a review of half the movie. The part I saw was worth half a star, so maybe the rest was worth maybe another half a star.Where to start, where to start? How about my excuse for checking this out; my friend was actually the one who bought it, and I had been eyeing the dvd on his shelf for awhile. Time after time I asked to borrow it, and time after time he warned me not to. In true horror movie fashion, I didn't heed his advice...and paid for it...Ah, but there are laughs aplenty. I'll go in order: the opening fight scene is a riot, with so many missed punches you would think they were shadow boxing. Mr. Estevez, who looks like a rattier version of Emilio, plays one of the workers leery of a recently excavated werewolf skeleton that has - bone ears. I would be leery as well. This is followed by alot of silliness. One of the workers was cut by the jawbone of the skeleton and turns into a wolf over the course of twenty long movie minutes in one of the most tedious transformations in werewolf history. He then alternates in appearance from hairy wolfman makeup to ape suit to hand puppet. Good stuff.And then our hero is infected with werewolf-itis, and his girlfriend, talking like the great-grandaughter of the gypsy woman in 'The Wolfman' proclaims 'Paul, you eez war-wulf'. He then hilariously twitches as he changes to romp after a couple making out.This leads to two of my favorite scenes. 1) he kills a young girl, chasing her through the night. She falls into a mud puddle and attacks! He throws her into the puddle - and looks at the camera as if the director tells him, 'hey man, you've got to kill her now.' Then he pounces, necking her better than her lover did moments earlier. 2) Yes, the pool hall scene. Tons of fluff, and no one notices the hero changing into a werewolf right at the booth! He then rampages through the hall, kills two men outside its door and runs off. ...moments later, cut back to the hall and the bodies are gone, a few people enter and everyone's still having a good time. His girl is still playing pool and it's super.I'm not sure if the straight faces managed by the cast are due to the skill or unawareness of the actors that what they were doing was utterly terrible. And think, it took two guys to write the script!

As our intrepid crew of clueless Anglo archaeologists are unearthing a dig on Indian territory the bullied Native American workers unearth the bones of a centuries old loup garou.As the crew are exulting over the find, (the werewolf skeleton), one of the archaeologists, Yuri, picks a fight with one of the workers causing him to fall on the bones and get cut. This worker is rushed to the hospital, where he turns into a werewolf. Next scene: Evil Anglo archaeologists are celebrating  their 'find of a lifetime' and are just about to plan on how they can get more funding for their research, when the news of the worker's rampage reaches them.What follows is a choppy plot, wherein, Yuri, taking a sample of the infected worker's blood, deliberately infecting a security guard in the hope of making a real life werewolf to exploit to the meida. The plan goes awry, as lycanthropy is spread unwittingly throughout the town.This movie was simply cheesy. The acting was terrible, and every possible stereotype was exploited  to its full potential. From running girl, tripping and falling and savaged by the monster to the evil Anglo 'mad scientist's' intent on making millions with their brilliant research.What really bothered me the most about this movie,though,  was that, half way through the movie the entire cast seemed to be replaced by an entirely DIFFERENT cast, and the focus of the movie shifted entirely. What happened to the Native American worker in the hospital? What happened to the skeleton? I guess we'll never know... And perhaps that's a good thing....

192512,A3UA046AA3DXFD,1578480019,Sid the Elf,"[3, 4]","In the world of B horror films there are so many disasters available that sometimes it just gets hard to pick one worth watching. For the most part the films available now are usually very disapointing even when you're looking for something really bad. There is an art to this. The entire logic behind what we do is to find films that are so bad they're funny, not just to find bad films with nothing to offer. So when we're in a pinch we look to the always hilarious MST3k series to provide us with some of the worst films available with just the right amount of commentary to make them watchable. This time we picked up a film titled Werewolf starring one of our favorite B icons Joe Estevez.We start our film somewhere in Arizona as a group of archaeologists who came equipped with untraceable accents uncover an odd looking skeleton. They come to find that the remains belong to a werewolf which somehow starts one of the most hilarious fight scenes ever with not one connecting punch and more sound effects then any Chuck Norris movie. As the two diggers go back and forth in their poorly staged dry hump session Joe Estevez and his denim shirt step in to end the commotion. Unfortunately the one digger cuts himself on the werewolf skeleton as they rolled on the ground causing him to rapidly change in the course of about 25 mins. As some collect the skeleton and bring it back to the lab Joe and a couple others bring the injured guy to the hospital. One of the archeologists Yuri decides to bust into the hospital and inject the poor guy with some werewolf juice turning him into full blown wolfman who for some reason looks more like a bat then anything else. He breaks loose and goes back to the dig in search of his crew until he is gunned down by Joe. After Joe looks at what he shot, which now looks like a guy in a halloween gorilla costume and not a bat, he takes off running never to be seen again in the film. There is no explination of why we never see him again, but it kind of goes with the confusing theme of this film.The story now shifts with no explination as some guy named Paul comes into town and rents out a room from this character named Sam that looks like an x member of zz-top in full army fatigues. He answers the door with his shotgun telling Paul he has to be ready it in case of a werewolf attack. For some reason Paul just chuckles and decides living under the same roof as a gun toting army veteran who fears a wolfman invasion is completely normal. While living in the house he comes across a roomate named Natalie who is an archaeologist and the love interest of the evil Yuri. She dicides to bring Paul into their lab where he meets Yuri who picks a fight with him. As we witness our second girl fight of the evening we watch Paul and Yuri wrestle each other around throwing even gayer punches then in the first brawl. Seconds befor Yuri is caught with the front he holds up the werewolf skull which cuts Paul and sends Natalie into a panic knowing the what the outcome will be. Once home later that evening a full moon blooms turning Paul into the crazed wolfman. From this point on we get to see some horific metamorphasis scenes where he turns from mere man to mere man in gorilla costume and terrorizes the townspeople. Then Paul finally exacts his revenge on Yuri taking his life and we see that Natalie is also now a werewolf in one of the most B endings ever.On it's own this film would have been a disaster. There still would have been some laughs but the MST3k dialogue really helped out. Now throughout this films there were a couple strange occurrences that forced us to seek out some answers. We wondered why Joe Estevez just disappeared in the first 30 mins and why the guy Yuri's hair continue to change color and shape throughout the film? After some research it appears the film kept running out of their budget and filmed over several years. So it appears Joe was to busy filming Money to Burn to come back and there wasn't enough money to spring for some hair dye to keep Yuri looking the same as he did when they first started shooting years earlier. Just hilarious! To wrap this one up we're going to leave you with some more hilarious facts behind Werewolf:1) Uri's hair color and style changes constantly throughout the film with no explanation.2) Nathalie's ""Russian"" accent changes constantly throughout the film. At one point, in the bar with Yuri, she speaks in a clear Southern accent.3) During Yuri's fight with the three guys in the desert, his sunglasses appear on his face between shots.4) During Yuri's excavation of the Werewolf skeleton, the object in Yuri's hand changes from a pickaxe to a brush to nothing at all from shot to shot.5) When Paul goes on his rampage out of the bar, he knocks out a man as soon as he exits. When the camera comes in for a close shot of the man, you can clearly see the shadow of the camera operator on the man's shirt and also the camera operator kicking the man.6) When Paul is chasing after the girl in the jeep, after she ""falls"" in the mud, the girl screams. However, reading her lips clearly shows that she is saying, ""Oh my god!""7) When the ""Girl in Jeep"" runs away from the werewolf, her dress is already muddy just before she reaches the mud puddle.8) The nighttime scenes are obviously daytime scenes shot through a blue filter.9) During the driving scene where Yuri follows the security guard/werewolf, both drivers pass the same gas station twice. Also, Yuri turns the steering wheel like he is making sharp turns when he is driving straight.10) When the girl in the jeep is running from the werewolf, you can clearly hear both her own screams and a separate voice that is screaming. This second screaming voice was clearly pre-recorded and was put on the audio track.11) During the scene where Paul first turns into a werewolf, an establishing shot of the house exterior shows that it is nighttime. Inside Paul's room, it is sunset.12) It is never explained how Natalie becomes a werewolf at the end.",4,Even Joe Estevez realized how awful this film was by running off the set after just 30
