1650009,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00CPTUN3I,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","Don Malek (Stephen Geoffreys) is a professional screen writer and amateur surgeon and vigilante. In the opening scene he torture/kills his screen producer while having flashbacks to a woman. He shares his crime with his understanding agent (Tiffany Shepis) who didn't like the producer either. Don stays at a dive hotel in the high crime area of town for the ambiance of his writing.Outside of the killing, Don is rather dull. Tiffany Shepis is a more animated character, but wasn't enough to carry the film. The movie ended at an interesting point, one that should have happened about 30 minutes into the film. The dullness of Don's character made the film slow and lifeless.A low end rental at best. Released in 2010 as ""New Terminal Hotel"" now making its way around Redbox with a new title.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Danielle Fortwangler, Tara Sukustis)",2,EVERYBODY HAS ONE,1375747200,"08 6, 2013",2013,866,"['Don', 'Malek', 'Stephen', 'Geoffreys', 'professional', 'screen', 'writer', 'amateur', 'surgeon', 'vigilante', 'opening', 'scene', 'screen', 'producer', 'having', 'flashbacks', 'woman', 'shares', 'crime', 'understanding', 'agent', 'Tiffany', 'Shepis', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'producer', 'Don', 'dive', 'hotel', 'high', 'crime', 'area', 'town', 'ambiance', 'writing.Outside', 'killing', 'Don', 'rather', 'dull', 'Tiffany', 'Shepis', 'more', 'animated', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'carry', 'film', 'movie', 'ended', 'interesting', 'point', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'happened', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'dullness', 'Don', 'character', 'made', 'film', 'slow', 'lifeless.A', 'low', 'end', 'rental', 'best', 'Released', '2010', 'New', 'Terminal', 'Hotel', 'now', 'making', 'way', 'Redbox', 'new', 'title.Parental', 'Guide', 'F-bomb', 'sex', 'nudity', 'Danielle', 'Fortwangler', 'Tara', 'Sukustis']",Do Not Disturb
