1654739,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00DBPBOZG,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 0]","This movie was good, but the key word here is creepy.  Good old-fashioned creepy storytelling done well with an excellent creepy atmosphere.Written and produced by rookie filmmakers, the long-short of it all is this:  In this twisted take on the ""tooth fairy"" fairy tale, an Italian Malaria ghost wants her teeth back and she'll kill as many innocent people as it takes until one of them happens to randomly figure out why she's killing, what she wants and where to find it.The story begins when young Helena notices her first loose tooth and inquires about the tooth fairy.  Her mother Sophia, like any loving parent, humors her with an all too familiar story.  But for the ""horror"" in this story to take root something must go wrong for Helena and her single mother.This evil enters their lives after they get a cursed wardrobe with claw marks on the inside.  Maybe it's just me and I'm just paranoid or superstitious, but upon seeing claw marks on the inside of a lockable ""anything"" I'd think twice about it.  Like an imprisoning lamp to its genie, this wardrobe had--until now--kept an evil restless spirit at bay.Following familiar formula, the young child in our story begins to act strangely.  Helena buys teeth from her elementary school classmates in the schoolyard with curiously old coins which she couldn't possibly have stumbled across on her own.  She also begins producing disturbing drawings.From there some very creepy things happen, Helena begins talking to an ""imaginary"" friend, and there are some good scares along the way.  Many scenes were VERY chilling.There's a twist at the end.  It was unnecessary; the movie was fine without it.  But I had fun with it anyway and it added another dimension to the solid storytelling.This is no must-see sensation, but it was done very well and it would be a worthy contribution to a dark and stormy night (alone or with a date, etc.).  The ghost is presented with fine effects; our evil tooth fairy is creepy, disturbing and nuanced.",4,"The key word here is CREEPY.

1654744,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00DBPBOZG,Matthew Scott Baker,"[2, 4]","I love horror movies that take a traditional aspect of our lives and turn it into something terrifying.  I particularly enjoy those flicks that can take an innocent childhood tale or myth and distort it into a horrific joyride of fun.  And that is exactly what THE HAUNTING OF HELENA does; it turns a light and airy ritual of youth into a dark foray into horror.The Tooth Fairy has always frightened me, but I'm not sure why.  It might be because she can slip into your house undetected, much like Santa Clause, but she comes to take things instead of leave them.  Or it could simply be her obsession with teeth and her willingness to pay in order to get them.  If such a being existed, how far might she go to get what she wanted?THE HAUNTING OF HELENA is not a traditional Tooth Fairy story, but it sure packs one hell of a punch.  It is shot very well, and I have to confess that some of the cinematography is what makes the film so creepy.  The opening scene is particularly well done, and I was shocked to learn in the Behind the Scenes featurette that much of it was done with computer animation.  The CG images are seamless and create an amazing opening sequence that sets the tone for the whole film.The acting is pretty good overall, although I am almost ashamed to admit that I don't care much for performance given by the actress who portrayed young Helena, Sabrina Jolie Perez.  For me, she lacks the emotional range and depth needed for a role like this one.  Instead of sadness or joy, all I see in her facial expressions is a bland gaze that reads like depression.  This does not detract from the movie, as her portrayal of Helena is simply downright eerie, but I do feel it is worth mentioning.  Hopefully, her future roles will come out differently.But what really wins this film for me is the writing and the story itself.  There is a huge revelation towards the end that I never saw coming, which almost made the movie for me in itself.  The plot moves at a nice pace and I never once felt like it was going stale.  There are also several chilling scenes that literally made my flesh crawl.  You just can't ask for much more in a horror film.THE HAUNTING OF HELENA is a top notch film that deserves your attention.

For example, the scene where Helena (Sabrina Jolie Perez in her only screen role to date) is sitting at one of those brightly-colored little-kid desks. There's nothing much else in the room, which is odd and does not ring true and contributes about a mountain's worth of atmosphere. Then something falls and clatters off the desk, and this begins a rain of bloody teeth as Helena scrambles under the desk. It's a pretty amazing visual, and little scenes like that, were they correctly integrated with the rest of the movie, would have made this an overlooked little gem. As it is, however, they make it an interesting, if ultimately failed, experiment that still manages to be worth watching for little things like that that crop up once in a while.Plot: Helena and her mother, Sofia (Smile's Harriet MacMasters-Green), move into a lovely old home. Dad (The Passion of the Christ's Jarreth J. Merz) is out of the picture, so the two of them are on their own. Everything goes swimmingly until Helena loses her first tooth. (Soon after, Sofia has a rather terrifying vision that you would think would make her put more stock in what her daughter is saying, but no luck.) She starts talking about a tooth fairy who comes to visit her demanding teeth, to the point where she starts buying teeth from kids at school...and paying them in rare coins that seem to have been mysteriously conjured out of nowhere. Sofia, determined to find a rational explanation for all of this, draws in an ever-widening circle of doctors, psychologists, and even her ex, while Helena continues to insist that there is indeed a supernatural explanation.The movie's main drawback, which more than counteracts the main strength above, is that you have seen it before (even the Tooth Fairy angle has been covered by at least two movies I can think of off the top of my head in the past decade). Bisceglia and Maglarini did nothing new with the story; it struck me that they were relying on a series of arresting images to carry the film, rather than attempting to push any envelopes. To their credit, said images can be very arresting, and the film is beautifully-shot. If that's enough for you, it's worth checking out, but it probably shouldn't be at the top of your list. ** ",3,The Moue-th Fairy.,1402531200,"06 12, 2014",2014,2499,"['Haunting', 'Helena', 'Christian', 'Bisceglia', 'Ascanio', 'Maglarini', '2012', 'are', 'truly', 'arresting', 'scenes', 'Haunting', 'Helena', 'kind', 'risky', 'stylistic', 'choices', 'done', 'correctly', 'can', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'making', 'breaking', 'movie', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'Helena', 'Sabrina', 'Jolie', 'Perez', 'only', 'screen', 'role', 'date', 'sitting', 'one', 'brightly-colored', 'little-kid', 'desks', 'nothing', 'much', 'else', 'room', 'odd', 'not', 'ring', 'true', 'mountain', 'worth', 'atmosphere', 'Then', 'something', 'falls', 'clatters', 'desk', 'rain', 'bloody', 'teeth', 'Helena', 'scrambles', 'desk', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'visual', 'little', 'scenes', 'were', 'correctly', 'integrated', 'rest', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'overlooked', 'little', 'gem', 'however', 'make', 'interesting', 'ultimately', 'failed', 'experiment', 'still', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'little', 'things', 'crop', 'up', 'once', 'while.Plot', 'Helena', 'mother', 'Sofia', 'Smile', 'Harriet', 'MacMasters-Green', 'move', 'lovely', 'old', 'home', 'Dad', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'Jarreth', 'J.', 'Merz', 'picture', 'two', 'are', 'own', 'Everything', 'swimmingly', 'Helena', 'first', 'tooth', 'Soon', 'Sofia', 'rather', 'terrifying', 'vision', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'put', 'more', 'stock', 'what', 'daughter', 'saying', 'luck', 'talking', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'who', 'visit', 'demanding', 'teeth', 'point', 'where', 'buying', 'teeth', 'kids', 'school', 'paying', 'rare', 'coins', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'mysteriously', 'conjured', 'nowhere', 'Sofia', 'determined', 'find', 'rational', 'explanation', 'ever-widening', 'circle', 'doctors', 'psychologists', 'even', 'ex', 'Helena', 'insist', 'indeed', 'supernatural', 'explanation.The', 'movie', 'main', 'drawback', 'more', 'main', 'strength', 'have', 'seen', 'even', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'angle', 'been', 'covered', 'least', 'two', 'movies', 'can', 'think', 'top', 'head', 'past', 'decade', 'Bisceglia', 'Maglarini', 'did', 'nothing', 'new', 'story', 'struck', 'were', 'relying', 'series', 'arresting', 'images', 'carry', 'film', 'rather', 'attempting', 'push', 'envelopes', 'credit', 'said', 'images', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'arresting', 'film', 'beautifully-shot', 'enough', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'top', 'list', '**']",The Haunting of Helena

It had the atmosphere of a excellent stage play and its a story you'll not soon forget.,4,Yep its Creepy,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,423,"['nothing', 'fancy', 'movie', 'Just', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'story', 'telling', 'Director', 'had', 'unique', 'way', 'filming', 'was', 'very', 'effective', 'love', 'horror', 'movies', 'where', 'creature', ""n't"", 'fool', 'around', 'nothing', 'anyone', 'can', 'do', 'thought', 'had', 'story', 'figured', 'out', 'early', 'was', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'not', 'easily', 'fooled', 'had', 'atmosphere', 'excellent', 'stage', 'play', 'story', ""'ll"", 'not', 'soon', 'forget']",The Haunting of Helena

There was a constant undercurrent of horror just beneath the surface; that put me on edge with a feeling of dread and apprehension.  It just didn't concern ghostly horror, it also depicted the psychological horror of people at their worse.  It was not a slash and gash with a little soft porno added.  This was a low key supernatural thriller with very good acting.  The plot had twists and turns and all in all it was a pretty unnerving flick.  Of course, this is just my opinion. You may feel differently about it.",4,The Haunting of Helena,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,572,"['movie', 'was', 'good', 'projected', 'lot', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'constant', 'undercurrent', 'horror', 'just', 'surface', 'put', 'edge', 'feeling', 'dread', 'apprehension', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'concern', 'ghostly', 'horror', 'also', 'depicted', 'psychological', 'horror', 'people', 'worse', 'was', 'not', 'slash', 'gash', 'little', 'soft', 'porno', 'added', 'was', 'low', 'key', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'plot', 'had', 'twists', 'turns', 'was', 'pretty', 'unnerving', 'flick', 'course', 'just', 'opinion', 'may', 'feel', 'differently']",The Haunting of Helena
