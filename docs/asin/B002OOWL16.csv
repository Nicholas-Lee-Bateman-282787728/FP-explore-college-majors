Although I would have liked giving it Five Stars, I felt honesty best, so clicked four Stars.First, the price was awfully high. According to other Amazon feed-backers, Season 5 could only be bought through Shout Factory.Reading this is baffling. I got my copy here on Amazon, for 39.00 plus shipping. Am I missing something? Is there a problem with the copy I purchased from this Amazon seller? I believe there is/was only one. If so, please leave a comment.Second. As I stated above, I love Father Knows Best Show, but I felt cheated with certain episodes on Season 5. They were repeats from earlier shows. The idea was to 'think back' to a time when....I wonder how long final rehearsal and taping took to complete a 'Memory Lane' episode. It couldn't have taken long, considering while going back to a time when,,,,,the original show was aired. In other words, they weren't made-up to look younger, redid the show. The kids were grown, so that'd be a little tricky.There might be a reason. Perhaps one of the actors got sick, had problems, or just grew tired.Last, it would have been great if the DVD's included Special Features. Deleted scenes, Bloopers, Interviews. There are numerous rumors why Billy Gray didn't do an interview.I hope Shout Factory decides to release Season 6. Waiting is torture, lol.

It is a shame that the only way you can order this is through them.  But hey people...at least it's on DVD.  That aside, many fans and critics consider this season to be the best of the series.  There are more stand-out episodes than any other season.  First and foremost is the FORMULA FOR HAPPINESS, a weird show that has Jim {""Father""] having a creepy dream that later begins to come true.  This show filmed in 1958 was a forerunner to Rod Serlings' classic series, TWILIGHT ZONE, which bowed on CBS the next year.  I wonder what he thought of that segment?  Other standouts include THE GOOD SAMARITAN, which has son ""Bud"" and friend help out a needy man who is down on his luck.  Their intentions are good, but not appreciated.  And the unexpected twist in the middle of the show is somewhat jarring.  Mother ""Margaret Wins a Car,"" a $5,000 beauty.  Emmy winner Jane Wyatt plays that episode with heart and compassion, when he helps out the orphanage by giving the kids a ride for a picnic, much to her own kids displeasure.  Selfish? Yup, but it all works out in the end.  The shows which focus on Billy Gray as Bud seem to be the best ones.  Another good one is BUD AND THE DEBUTTANTE, which features Gray squiring around a rich girl. I have always wondered if Gray was ever nominated for a best supporting actor Emmy, cause he definitely deserved it.  All in all, a great season for fans and non-fans alike.  Bonus features {alas, no new Bill Gray interviews] include two episodes of Robert Young's next series, WINDOW ON MAIN STREET.  Father Knows Best and Marcus Welby sandwiched this show, which is so-so.  Still it's nice to see Young play another character.  FKB season 5 is a gotta have.
