1373745,A1AYNQ4Q8AZ0X,B003Y5H5EW,anonymous,"[0, 0]","This film was my introduction into the ""Underworld"" franchise.  I've never been a fan of vampire movies, so I typically steer clear of them, but I was hungry for a 3D movie and took a chance.  I'm glad I did because I loved it! It's not a slow, horror movie, and it doesn't involve the usual vampire cliches like driving a stake through the heart or using garlic or crosses to ward them off.  There's plenty of gunfire, crashes, explosions and gorey deaths to satisfy the action fan.  The 3D experience is great because the movie was filmed with 3D cameras, so there's lots of depth and pop-out effects.  However, at times it was a bit difficult to appreciate the 3D effects because most of the scenes were dark to begin with, and I found myself adjusting the brightness more than once to compensate for the added level of darkness caused by the glasses.  Still, the 3D effects were much more enjoyable than in many other so-called 3D movies, especially those poorly done 2D-to-3D conversions like ""Clash of the Titans"" and its sequel.After watching ""Awakening,"" I had to buy the first 3 chapters in the story because I was so impressed with this one.  The earlier films focus a bit more on story and the history of the feud between the vampires and lycans.  It helps if you've seen those movies, but I don't think it's mandatory if you're in it just for the effects and butt-kicking action.  The movie opens with a short montage of clips as Selene explains what came before, then she talks about how a war to eradicate the vamps and werewolves began after humans discovered their existence.

I like Milla jovovich's characters for what they started off as. But for Selene and the Underworld trilogy to have such a deep meaning and plot development? This 4 installment comes off as somewhat of a shocker to me. The visuals were still decent but the execution was lousy and rushed. The story was abysmal and the acting was just ok not serious.Everything was just so fast that is just seemed rushed and not very well planned. The lycans looked horribly and I mean horribly designed and CGI'ed. I am really curious as to why this one had a higher budget than the previous three. The 3rd installment ""Rise of the Lycans"" was a revelation to this . I guess if you are one of those people that had a hard time following a deep story you'll love this. But if not then you will probably be horribly disappointed. There was very little character development here so I don't think you will care about anyone. She was good in it for what she had to work with and play with.The only positives i can say about this over the 1st two installments. Is that she was finally a real vampire and a merciless killer. And the gore aspect was fantastic which wasn't in the previous two films. To see Selene kill humans with lack of empathy and suck there blood was just sexy. Other than that this movie doesn't offer anything above the 1st two. And to say that it hasn't progressed Technology over the 1st is pretty bad. I think ""Evolution"" and ""Rise"" looked way better than this one and that's putting it nicely. I really hope Patrick and Danny Mcbride jumps on board next time to save the franchise.

Selena was herself, she picked off the people in the lab building where she had been cryo frozen for 12 years and Im glad that time didnt mellow he almost ballet like dispatch of her enemies.2. Her daughter was delightful mix of her and Michael. The actress playing her was totally believable and indeed it takes a lot for a girl playing a 12 year old to his and snarl and be monstrous without looking stupid. She really was brilliant here beside adorabel.3. The revelation of who set off the chain of events of human/vampire/lyca fight for survival was a shocker.  It seems that the Lycans have been busy.Cons: 1. Time wasted on flashbacks not even done in sequential order. A wast of film time I thought. Who could forget the other movies to that extent.2. We really don't know what suddenly tipped off the humans as two the two different species living right under there noses, thought I suspect the Lycans needed panic in the streets to accomplish their goal of a super, hugh, silver resistant werewolf. Still though because the movie started with the human preventive measures already rolling on the TV screens it is a bit confusing. But then the Lycan scientists security precation may well have failed without outside interference with them being put down.3. The Lycans themselves were an odd bunch. They seemed more docile though no less deadly. They seemed to lack the grace they showed previously as they bounded after their prey and after catching, they were totaly absent that sink your fangs in and shake your head violently till you get a slice, they seemed less hungry then previous Lyacan generation's. Simply put, they were pretty clumsy and poorly tendered.4. How did the Vampires with their keen sense of smell and hearing not take note that something was going on in that big lab building which woul have stunk of lycans to all hell.5. What happened to the silver nitrate, the liquid silver bullets like the one that Craven used to finish of Lucian you would have thought they would be load with those. Thats a plothole and were were the Lycans Ultraviolet bullets? Both successful inventions seemed to go unused and the Lycans seem to die more by hide ventilation by regular machine gun bullets then silver.6. And where did Michael go? Didnt he sense his daughter? Male Parents are just as dangerous when it comes to their young as the female. Will another movie tie all these loose end together? Will Vampire and Lycan finally learn to live and let live?Basically what this movie needed was a moment called ""The Prestige"" as described in the Chris Bale, Michael Caine film. That one fantastic moment in the film that gets you jumping out of your chair and yahoooing that scene as the main one that made it all worthwhile.But if you like Underworld Series you will like this movie plot points and all, Kate is as beautifull as ever and the blood keeps flowing.In the end, on the roof where Michael was just seconds ago on camera Selena give a kind of we will rebuild and go on, almost Scarlet O Hara like. ""As God is my witness there will covens in abundance again.""I guess its now up to Kate Beckinsdale and Len Weisman to see if they can bring this fantastic story stretching out over centuries to a respectable close?

That's what I enjoy most about the series. Vampires and Lycans ARE violent. They are not nice, glittery, controllable things. After the events of the second film we find out that the humans have found out about these species and are doing what they can to 'cleanse' the world of them. This of course has brought about a war of sorts between the three different races.Where we pick up is with Selene on her way to meet up with Michael to escape to a safer place, all the while she's showing she is still in top killing form, pulling off some beautiful moves. Things don't go as planned and she ends up waking up twelve years later in a cryogenic state. This is where the movie really starts.Kate Beckinsale returns to the Underworld universe after a one movie hiatus, instantly reminding us why she was so good in the first two films. Her moves are sharp and fast and she has that cold stare that can send chills. Selene is a Death Dealer, the last of her kind. In a world where Vampires are quick to run and hide, she still stands up and fights. In Awakening, she's not just killing to kill, she's killing to protect. This equation brings in a new dynamic that adds more ferver.For everything great that Awakening does, there were a few missteps. The CGI in more than a few scenes looks terrible, and the pacing at the beginning of the movie was far too brisk. Even I, someone who has seen the other films many times, was left wondering...'huh?' Once it settles down and decides what direction its gonna go in, the movie does a fine job of balancing pacing, action, and story. Awakening probably won't introduce new people to the series, but for those of us that enjoy the other films, it does a great job of building upon the story, adding a new dynamic and leaving more than a couple doors open for future installments.",4,Vampires and Lycans how they were intended to be,1327190400,"01 22, 2012",2012,1937,"['Purge', 'begun.Underworld', 'approached', 'Vampires', 'Lycans', 'werewolves', 'violent', 'way', 'beginning', 'what', 'enjoy', 'most', 'series', 'Vampires', 'Lycans', 'ARE', 'violent', 'are', 'not', 'nice', 'glittery', 'controllable', 'things', 'events', 'second', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'humans', 'have', 'found', 'out', 'species', 'are', 'doing', 'what', 'can', ""'cleanse"", 'world', 'course', 'brought', 'war', 'sorts', 'three', 'different', 'races.Where', 'pick', 'up', 'Selene', 'way', 'meet', 'up', 'Michael', 'escape', 'safer', 'place', 'showing', 'still', 'top', 'killing', 'form', 'pulling', 'off', 'beautiful', 'moves', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'planned', 'up', 'waking', 'up', 'twelve', 'years', 'later', 'cryogenic', 'state', 'where', 'movie', 'really', 'starts.Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'returns', 'Underworld', 'universe', 'one', 'movie', 'hiatus', 'instantly', 'reminding', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'moves', 'are', 'sharp', 'fast', 'cold', 'stare', 'can', 'send', 'chills', 'Selene', 'Death', 'Dealer', 'last', 'kind', 'world', 'where', 'Vampires', 'are', 'quick', 'run', 'hide', 'still', 'up', 'fights', 'Awakening', 'not', 'just', 'killing', 'kill', 'killing', 'protect', 'equation', 'new', 'dynamic', 'more', 'ferver.For', 'everything', 'great', 'Awakening', 'were', 'few', 'missteps', 'CGI', 'more', 'few', 'scenes', 'terrible', 'pacing', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'brisk', 'Even', 'someone', 'who', 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'many', 'times', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'down', 'what', 'direction', 'gon', 'go', 'movie', 'fine', 'job', 'balancing', 'pacing', 'action', 'story', 'Awakening', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'introduce', 'new', 'people', 'series', 'enjoy', 'other', 'films', 'great', 'job', 'building', 'story', 'adding', 'new', 'dynamic', 'leaving', 'more', 'couple', 'doors', 'open', 'future', 'installments']",N/A

Because I have some standards, and that's where I draw the line.  It's also the only way I can justify buying a movie--with the requirement that all of us can watch it (we don't have young kids).What the movies have in common (no spoilers):1) Strong female lead characters and actors that fit the bill. These women are tough, and they are tough while wearing black leather (which I suspect makes acting in damp scenes--of which there are plenty--uncomfortable!  And how they can wear those stomper boots while looking great and not going ""clomp-clomp"" when they walk and run, must be a movie-making secret!2) Dark scenes with a bluish tone. If you don't see well in the dark, stop early on and adjust your tv's ""brightness.""3) Scenes that are verrrryyy quiet or really loud. I live with people that need a little help hearing words during both extremes so we use the closed captions. They were distracting at first, but I find them helpful sometimes too, so now I use them for all movies.4) A healthy dose of predictability, but often cleverly staged and/or filmed.5) The bad guys aren't just bad. They're really evil bad guys (but sometimes conflicted about it).6) So far, well choreographed fight scenes. The big budgets at work!7) Much better than average Lycans! So good, in fact, that the viewer isn't constantly distracted by the poorly combed fake fur and laughably constructed costumes of lesser movies!I hope that someone in the movie studio industry will take notice that there is a market for EDITED versions of these (and similar) movies! It would be so easy for them to add a PG-13 version of the movie to the Bluray (for new movies) and release an edited version that older teens and people like me can enjoy...

Not that Rise was a bad movie, it was a prequel when I wanted a sequel.  Nevertheless, this movie has all the hallmarks of the franchise, and then some.  Plus, it sets it up nicely for the next movie should there be one.  If you enjoyed Underworld 1 and 2, you will certainly enjoy this entry in the series.A side note: The digital copy you get will be only accessible through the Ultraviolet platform.  In my opinion, the far inferior method of delivering digital copies.  Too many steps to get to your digital copy, plus you don't actually get a digital copy of your product (as in the file), you just get access to it in Ultraviolet's cloud.  At least with iTunes, if Apple goes kaput tomorrow, I still have my digital copy that will run on any number of platforms (Media player, DivX, etc.) whereas Ultraviolet and Flixster have encoded the copies so they can only be played by their programs.

1373777,AB34G6VKP28L,B003Y5H5EW,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[25, 32]","There is really only one film franchise out there that continually has me salivating for more, and that's the gritty, paranormal reality of ""Underworld."" While shorter than the other installments in the series, ""Awakening"" is one of the finest installments yet.Where once vampires and lycans lived in secret, the war between them has escalated and the truth is out. In a desperate attempt to maintain the upper hand, humans have enforced martial law and are hunting down both species, identifying it as a ""virus"" without a cure. Their assault on the two races that have lived among them unnoticed for centuries forces individuals on both sides into hiding, but before Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and her hybrid lover Michael (Scott Speedman) can escape, they are hunted down. Twelve years later, awakening from stasis in a laboratory, Selene is determined to find out what has happened to Michael -- and to discover the source of her hallucinations, which permit her to see through another creature's eyes. Her desperate escape introduces her to David (Theo James), a member of one of the few remaining Covens, and then to the little girl that both humans and lycans seem to want -- Eve (India Eisley).After she is badly wounded during a lycan attack, David takes them both to the Coven -- much to the disapproval of his father (Charles Dance), little realizing the consequences this will have for them all. If you have any familiarity with the franchise, you will know what this series is all about: the battle between vampires and lycans (werewolves) as it evolves in a futuristic society. The most successful installments have revolved around Selene and although I was not keen on the idea of this film back when it was announced (to be honest, I was disappointed they didn't make another prequel showing the rise of Lucian), the end result is marvelous. Changing the backdrop and introducing Eve could have backfired but it doesn't; we accept that the world has altered and are still rooting for our leather-clad immortal heroine to save the day in whatever way she can. And in this one she does, with her usual flair and undoubted style. Everything we loved about the earlier films is present here, from the jaw-dropping action sequences to the twirl of her coat as she kicks some lycan butt.Even though it is violent, there's a lot to like about this film series and this film in particular. It explores an alternate reality in which the heroine is unconventional, a vampire seeking to protect her own from a lycan clan that would gladly kill Eve to harvest her abilities. I'm also fond of its consistent use of talented British actors in the roles of vampire elders -- in the original and the prequel we had Bill Nighy, in the sequel we had Derek Jacobi, and now we have Charles Dance. Throw in an incredible remix of an Amy Lee Evanescence track over the ending credits and you have a movie series that may not strive to be intelligent, but it is always entertaining. But putting all that aside, its immense success comes down to one rather trivial truth: it's just plain cool.",3,A Terrific Addition to the Franchise,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,3082,"['really', 'only', 'one', 'film', 'franchise', 'there', 'continually', 'salivating', 'more', 'gritty', 'paranormal', 'reality', 'Underworld', 'shorter', 'other', 'installments', 'series', 'Awakening', 'one', 'finest', 'installments', 'yet.Where', 'once', 'vampires', 'lycans', 'lived', 'secret', 'war', 'escalated', 'truth', 'out', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'maintain', 'upper', 'hand', 'humans', 'have', 'enforced', 'martial', 'law', 'are', 'hunting', 'down', 'species', 'identifying', 'virus', 'cure', 'assault', 'two', 'races', 'have', 'lived', 'unnoticed', 'centuries', 'forces', 'individuals', 'sides', 'hiding', 'Selene', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'hybrid', 'lover', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'can', 'escape', 'are', 'hunted', 'down', 'Twelve', 'years', 'later', 'awakening', 'stasis', 'laboratory', 'Selene', 'determined', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Michael', 'discover', 'source', 'hallucinations', 'permit', 'see', 'creature', 'eyes', 'desperate', 'escape', 'David', 'Theo', 'James', 'member', 'one', 'few', 'remaining', 'Covens', 'then', 'little', 'girl', 'humans', 'lycans', 'seem', 'want', 'Eve', 'India', 'Eisley', '.After', 'badly', 'wounded', 'lycan', 'attack', 'David', 'Coven', 'much', 'disapproval', 'father', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'little', 'realizing', 'consequences', 'will', 'have', 'have', 'familiarity', 'franchise', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'series', 'battle', 'vampires', 'lycans', 'werewolves', 'futuristic', 'society', 'most', 'successful', 'installments', 'have', 'revolved', 'Selene', 'was', 'not', 'keen', 'idea', 'film', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'announced', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'prequel', 'showing', 'rise', 'Lucian', 'end', 'result', 'marvelous', 'Changing', 'backdrop', 'introducing', 'Eve', 'could', 'have', 'backfired', ""n't"", 'accept', 'world', 'altered', 'are', 'still', 'rooting', 'leather-clad', 'immortal', 'heroine', 'save', 'day', 'way', 'can', 'one', 'usual', 'flair', 'undoubted', 'style', 'Everything', 'loved', 'earlier', 'films', 'present', 'here', 'jaw-dropping', 'action', 'sequences', 'twirl', 'coat', 'lycan', 'butt.Even', 'violent', 'lot', 'like', 'film', 'series', 'film', 'particular', 'alternate', 'reality', 'heroine', 'unconventional', 'vampire', 'seeking', 'protect', 'own', 'lycan', 'clan', 'would', 'gladly', 'kill', 'Eve', 'harvest', 'abilities', ""'m"", 'also', 'fond', 'consistent', 'use', 'talented', 'British', 'actors', 'roles', 'vampire', 'elders', 'original', 'prequel', 'had', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'sequel', 'had', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'now', 'have', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'Throw', 'incredible', 'remix', 'Amy', 'Lee', 'Evanescence', 'track', 'ending', 'credits', 'have', 'movie', 'series', 'may', 'not', 'strive', 'be', 'intelligent', 'always', 'entertaining', 'putting', 'aside', 'immense', 'success', 'down', 'one', 'rather', 'trivial', 'truth', 'just', 'plain', 'cool']",N/A

The plot was not as exciting, in my opinion, as the previous movies in the series.  The good thing is that Kate Beckinsale has got the role of action star down pat.  She is probably one of the best female action star in the business today, right along with Angelina Jolie and Noomi Rapace.The movie time frame takes place a few years after the events of Underworld 2.  You may recall that Underworld 3 dealt with the backstory and told the story of Lucian and Sonia.  Basically, in chronological order in terms of the story, this is the order:  U3, U1, U2, and then this one.  Here we find our hero, the female vampire Selene, awakened from a deep sleep.  Not a natural vampire sleep, mind you, but a state of suspended animation within a laboratory.  Humans have learned of the existence of vampires, and have won the war.  Selene learns that she has a child with Michael, taken out of her while she was in suspension.  Escaping from the lab with her daughter in tow, they set out to look for the remaining vampires.Beckinsale did not start out as an action type of actress.  But with her experience in Underworld, Whiteout, and the recently made Total Recall, she has become one of the few female action stars in Hollywood.  Underworld is a pretty good franchise.  And this installment is no exception.  It is certainly worth your time to watch.

A pogrom ensues and the few surviving undead have gone underground. Selene and Michael have been captured and have been in deep freeze for over a decade. Selene escapes, but who let her go?And so we arrive at part 4 of the Underworld franchise. A new production team but no new ideas. Let's start with the bad and move onto the good...Plot? there ain't none. There's a back-story, the story-boarders were clearly very busy bees, but there's no >story&lt;. The cast run around a lot, look gorgeous or gross (depending on species) but no-one is really achieving much or going anywhere. Well, I guess you don't pick something like Underworld up at the video store after thinking ""Hmm, a good, complex story with twists, turns, chicanery and various other alarums and excursions is what I REALLY want tonight..."" but they could have made an effort couldn't they? The first two Underworlds had plot; tensions, surprises and so-on - complexity, however simplistic... how hard can it be?Really though, Awakening is a vehicle. A vehicle for two things - the lovely Kate and some quite astonishing quantities of gore. That brings us to the good. Kate Beckinsale certainly is easy on the eye. Her skintight PVC uniform returns, and she certainly knows how to use it: her moves are familiar (if a tad... predictable); leaping from buildings, swirling of leather greatcoats, straining of bodices and gussets. For those of you who prefer good looking fellas? Well I'm hardly qualified to comment but this is a bloke flick so you ladies will have to make do with Theo James, because Stephen Rea and Charles Dance (doing a creditable, if unimaginative Bill Nighy impression) probably won't ring too many bells and a digitally projected Scott Speedman spends most of his screen-time upside-down in a fridge.The gore... oh the gore. There's nothing subtle about Underworld Awakening. The previous episodes were bloody, but Awakening turns it up to 11, with head-shots, decapitations and the traumatic (and often manual) removal of critical organs. Even Selene's sweet, 12 year old daughter (and that barely counts as a spoiler, I can assure you) gets in on the act, ripping lycans in half down the medial line and so-on. OK, so it's a vampire/werewolf flick and we should expect stuff like this. It's fine. I can enjoy a good, brutalising evisceration like any normal person, but it does get a little... indecent? Desensitising? Dare I say it... unimaginative?So there you go. More of the same (as a fellow reviewer has already said). I truly loved the first, enjoyed the second and was disappointed by the third. I think, for all its faults, Awakening is still a good gore fest, undead actioner, excellent for a Friday or Saturday night after coming home from the pub and it falls somewhere between its predecessors. Good but not great. Acceptable but not aspirational. I'll give it 3 stars. I'd like to give it 4, but I think 3 is the best I can do at the moment.This is a 2 disc edition and the second has the usual line up of extras that I haven't yet got around to watching (or even listing).

Just saying it sounds idiotic, a dead vampire getting pregnant?If I sequel comes out I will still watch it because I do like the series",3,Just okay,1348358400,"09 23, 2012",2012,889,"['still', 'feel', 'first', 'Underworld', 'was', 'best', 'one', 'last', 'one', 'just', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'middle', 'film', 'Disappointed', 'Michael', 'was', ""n't"", 'film', 'nothing', 'was', 'mentioned', 'where', 'actually', 'was', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'will', 'be', 'Underworld.I', 'KNOW', 'THIS', 'A', 'MOVIE', 'writers', 'can', 'write', 'type', 'plot', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'winner', 'Bus', 'Vampires', 'becoming', 'pregnant', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Are', ""n't"", 'dead', 'Then', 'child', 'who', 'aged', '12', 'thought', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'do', ""n't"", 'age', 'so', 'how', 'can', 'baby', 'do', 'guess', 'view', 'old', 'fashion', 'way', 'more', 'sense', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'children', 'previous', 'movies', 'was', 'Silene', 'special', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'pregnant', 'Just', 'saying', 'idiotic', 'dead', 'vampire', 'getting', 'pregnant', 'sequel', 'out', 'will', 'still', 'watch', 'do', 'series']",N/A

1373814,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003Y5H5EW,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 3]","It has been nearly a decade since the release of the ""Underworld"" film.  The original film, directed by Len Wiseman (""Live Free and Die Hard"", ""Underworld: Evolution"") and written by Danny McBride, the first film would receive mixed reviews from critics but would make over $95 million in the box office and would pave the way for two more films, a sequel and a prequel.And now the fourth film, ""Underworld: Awakening"" directed by Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein (the duo who worked on the film ""Shelter"" and ""Storm""), join Len Wiseman (who continues to write the films) and reuniting with actress Kate Beckinsale (""Aviator"", ""Pearl Harbor"").""Underworld: Awakening"" was presented in theaters in 3D and brought in over $160 million in the box office, becoming the first film of 2012 to break $100 million.VIDEO:""Underworld: Awakening"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1) aspect ratio and you have the option of watching the film in 3D or 2D.With that being said, make no doubt about it, ""Underworld: Awakening"" is one of the better Blu-ray on 3D live action release.  Not only do you get the 3D depth but there are a number of moments where shattering of fragments, blood, artillery, debris and weapons are flying all over the place towards you.  And the great news is that the 3D is constant, it's not like you will see a 3D effect every 20 minutes.  There is a lot of action in this film and there is no doubt that when ""Underworld: Awakening"" was made, there was an emphasis put on the action and making the 3D benefit from these action sequences.With that being said, the video quality for this film is fantastic!  Sony hasn't really disappointed anyone with their Blu-ray releases of late and ""Underworld: Awakening"" is a film that retains its cool, dark look with blues, grays and blacks.  Black levels are nice and deep, explosions showcasing lighter colors such as oranges and ambers are vibrant.  Detail is very well done, especially showcasing the vampire or Lycan transformations.  Both 3D and 2D versions look amazing and videophiles should be pleased with both versions.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Underworld: Awakening"" not only showcases magnificent visuals and 3D, the lossless soundtrack is also immersive and fantastic.  Presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD MA, French 5.1 DTS-HD MA and English -Audio Description Track, like the 3D that is constant, as with the action.  There is plenty of action from cars crashing into each other, Selene unleashing a parade of bullets, elevators crashing, bodies being swatted like flies and hearing the groans, the growls, you name it...the audio is coming from all over the place.I was so pleased with this soundtrack and just hearing constant audio coming from the surround channels was a major plus for me and also, the music soundtrack also is utilized for the surround channels as well.You get an immersive lossless soundtrack with ""Underworld: Awakening"" and dialogue is crystal clear, there is nothing bad to say about the soundtrack for this film.  Audiophiles will definitely be pleased!Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""Underworld: Awakening"" comes with the following special features:Filmmakers Commentary - Featuring directors Mans Marlind, Bjorn Stein, producers Richard Wright and Gary Lucchesi, Executive producer and visual effects supervisor James McQuaide, this audio commentary is very active and informative.Selene Rises - (12:14) A featurette about Kate Beckinsale reprising her role as Selene and also going into the costume and character development.Casting the Future of Underworld - (12:33) A featurette about the two new cast members, Theo James and India Eisley.Resuming the Action - (8:52) A featurette about the film's action sequences, the stunts and the 3D technology used for the film.Building a Better Lycan - (10:20) A featurette on how they wanted to upgrade the visuals for the werewolves (Lycans).Previsualization Sequences - Featuring six pre-visualization sequences, including an alternate opening sequence: Alternate Opening Sequence (5:29), Car Chase in 3D (1:51), Coven Fight in 3D (1:58), Anitgen Attack - Part 1 (2:19), Antigen Attack - Part 2 (3:52), and Antigen Attack - Part 3 (6:05).Awakening a Franchise, Building a Brutal New World - (18:53) A featurette about the technology, special effects, set design for ""Underworld: Awakening"" and more.Blooper Reel - (3:21) Bloopers for ""Underworld: Awakening"".""Heavy Prey"" Music Video by Lacey Sturm feat. Geno Lenardo - (3:25) Featuring the music video ""Heavy Prey"".JUDGMENT CALL:I have always looked at the ""Underworld"" films as your vampire vs. werewolf popcorn action film series.  With ""Underworld: Awakening"", the writers were moving away from the ""Twilight"" mushy romance (or Romeo & Juliet romance, as I called the first two films).This time around, Juliet (Selene) is separated from her Romeo (Michael) and the world has turned against them.  They are the hunted and she lost 12-years of her life, to find out that she has a child who may be the most powerful child with vampire and Lycan blood, and most importantly, having the blood of Alexander Corvinus, hence the immortality.And what is quite interesting is the introduction of the two new characters, we have ""Secret Life of the American Teenager"" actress India Eisley playing Eve and a vampire named David (played by Theo James) as the next generation who will play an important role in the future of the films.I admit that while ""Underworld"" films are typically popcorn action films, there was depth in the storyline as it focused on the war between vampires and Lycans and treachery that went on behind-the-scenes.  There was a sense of brooding darkness that followed the characters but this time around, since most of the vampires and Lycans have been massacred, the film changes from being vampire vs. Lycans film to now the humans vs. the vampires, Lycans and hybrids.And there was no doubt that these films were now more action heavy, designed for 3D and the storyline, was made to be kept simple for those who have never watched the films in the trilogy.  And thus, the storyline is rather subjective.  Those who love the original storyline for its violent action but also romance, you can't have a romance in ""Underworld: Awakening"" when Juliet has been separated from her Romeo. So, without the romantic angle which has been a big part of the film series, you're left with the action and a storyline about being the hunted.And once again,  it's another popcorn action film and with actress Kate Beckinsale wearing a tight leather uniform but this time with upgraded visuals due to technology and a futuristic setting.  I felt that the makeup and creature design were fantastic for this film as with the visual effects, especially the 3D and fantastic lossless audio.The video and the lossless soundtrack were absolutely amazing and these two have been the strong points of the ""Underworld"" films but this time, they have raised the bar of how things look and sound.  The 3D really makes a difference and the constant immersive audio was a major plus.  And to top things off, there are a good number of special features to keep ""Underworld"" fans busy.  Make no doubt about it, this is a Blu-ray release that Blu-ray 3D enthusiasts plus video and audiophiles will surely enjoy!Overall, while ""Underworld: Awakening"" is not a film that focuses on a deep storyline, fans of the previous films know what to expect and that is a lot of bullets, a lot of deaths, non-stop action and Kate Beckinsale looking awesome a decade later in tight black leather.A worthy continuation of the ""Underworld"" film series that leans very heavy on the action, even those who have never watched an ""Underworld"" film can watch this film and enjoy it (there is an explanation of the first two films at the beginning of the film).  And for those expecting a lot of blood and gore, you get some of that as well in ""Underworld: Awakening"".If you are looking for an all-out action film with vampires vs. werewolves, ""Underworld: Awakening"" will definitely appeal to you!  And for those who have been wanting better Blu-ray 3D experiences, ""Underworld: Awakening"" is one of the better 3D live-action Blu-rays that I have seen in a while.",4,"If you love vampires and werewolves and love popcorn action films, ""Underworld: Awakening"" will definitely interest you.",1352332800,"11 8, 2012",2012,8273,"['been', 'nearly', 'decade', 'release', 'Underworld', 'film',

When the action is going its great, but there isnt enough of it!! Film starts with a bang, then slows down. Its worth watching, not buying. The film series could have been great but ran out of steam short after the first film was released.This film had a strange ending as well, wont give it away but just seems wrong. You will know when you watch it. In a nutshell kate is great in black leather and the gore is awesome but everything else falls way short. Here is the goods-Plus+Kate returns+Very Gory+Normal film lengthCons-Bad storyline (very boring)-Not enough action to drive the film-Kate plays the pg13 role again and gets 75 percent naked.

But when they're as threatening to man as vampires and werewolves are, I won't lose any sleep over it. Except that the vampires have a champion, however reluctant, and as played by Kate Beckinsale, Selene - with her slinky black leathers and take-no-prisoner attitude - swings the balance the other way yet again. So, here I am rooting for the bloodsucker and resenting humanity. Damn you, Kate Beckinsale.I'm guessing YouTube, but however way it went down, the human world now knows of the existence of vampires and Lycans - and that means bad cess to vampires and Lycans. Humanity reacts predictably: it sets out to reclaim its seat at the top of the foodchain. UNDERWORLD: AWAKENING opens with a voiceover narration from Selene which recaps the first two films and then catches us up to current events, namely the Cleansing. The Cleansing proved to be dangerous - you could even say ""terminal"" - years for vampires and Lycans. It got so bad that Selene and Michael, her hybrid lover, opted to get out of town. Except that Selene was captured enroute to her rendezvous with Michael and taken to a high security research facility and cryogenically frozen, ostensibly so that scientists can conduct tests on her to find a ""cure."" Cue the ominous soundtrack.Twelve years would elapse before Selene (or ""Subject One"") escapes her icy coffin and the clutches of Stephen Rea's creepy scientist. She emerges to a world which now believes that the vampire covens and Lycan packs have become near extinct. Selene's frantic search for Michael is derailed when she stumbles across a young hybrid vampire-Lycan girl (India Eisley) with whom she shares a psychic link. At least the film doesn't try to get coy regarding their relationship.The remaining Lycans desperately want their claws on this girl (for a spot of DNA harvesting), and so Selene finds herself in familiar territory, reassuming her Death Dealer persona and kicking werewolves harshly to the curb. There's more to the plot than that, but that is the gist of the narrative. Except for one human police detective ally (Michael Ealy), the humans' involvement gradually diminishes in the story.You can dismiss this franchise. You can make with the snarky and call it a B-movie and low brow and common denominator and cheesy and such, and my rebuttal goes like this: alabaster British beauty Kate Beckinsale furiously whuppin' butt in skin-tight black leather. Swedish directing duo Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein were charged with bringing UNDERWORLD back to the big screen, but they couldn't have done shizzy had Beckinsale not come back for another tour of duty. Beckinsale's cool swagger and deadpan determination are what I signed on for (sorry, Rhona Mitra). No, the dialogue isn't at an Oscar Wilde level and the acting is minimal and that's certainly not Scott Speedman briefly playing ""Michael"" (which may or may not be a good thing). But, again, I retort with Kate Beckinsale. She's like a classier Alice from RESIDENT EVIL (yes, because she has a cool British accent). Selene in the UNDERWORLD films is just one of my many guilty pleasures.I've always felt that for being a vampire, Selene was lacking in certain ""vampiry"" traits and, in fact, she seemed to rely overmuch on firearms. So I'm glad we get to see a scene in which Selene finally gets to bloodily gnaw at a throat. I'm fascinated by her place in the vampire hierarchy. By many accounts, she's regarded as a traitor to her species. She's killed two Elder vampires. She fell in love with a werewolf hybrid. She happens to be immune to sunlight. One can see where the other nosferatu may eye her with suspicion. Selene follows her own moral code which doesn't necessarily coincide with the traditional edicts of the reigning vampire societies.UNDERWORLD: AWAKENING unloads scenes of blistering action and more action. It also tries to give you 3-D, but don't hold that against it. I just saw HAYWIRE and made mention of how sturdy I thought Gina Carano was. But Selene takes even greater punishment. The special effects are top notch. I really like the big bad wolfman, and how he was depicted and then eventually defeated. India Eisley, the hybrid teen, merits two sequences in which she flexes her badassery. Werewolf skulls will get split in half. Other body parts will be cloven in two or eviscerated or just lopped off. Fun. And somewhere along the way Selene will demonstrate a pretty rough way to resuscitate a dead vampire. The way the film ends leaves a possibility for another sequel. Odds are, Stephen Rea won't be signing up for it.",4,"Selene, back to thinning them werewolf ranks... and sating them what have the leather fetish",1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,4654,"['rare', 'endorse', 'systematic', 'eradication', 'species', 'let', 'alone', 'two', 'when', ""'re"", 'threatening', 'man', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'are', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lose', 'sleep', 'vampires', 'have', 'champion', 'however', 'reluctant', 'played', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Selene', 'slinky', 'black', 'leathers', 'take-no-prisoner', 'attitude', 'swings', 'balance', 'other', 'way', 'yet', 'again', 'So', 'here', 'am', 'rooting', 'bloodsucker', 'resenting', 'humanity', 'Damn', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale.I', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'YouTube', 'however', 'way', 'went', 'down', 'human', 'world', 'now', 'existence', 'vampires', 'Lycans', 'bad', 'cess', 'vampires', 'Lycans', 'Humanity', 'predictably', 'out', 'reclaim', 'seat', 'top', 'foodchain', 'UNDERWORLD', 'AWAKENING', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'Selene', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'then', 'catches', 'current', 'events', 'namely', 'Cleansing', 'Cleansing', 'proved', 'be', 'dangerous', 'could', 'even', 'say', 'terminal', 'years', 'vampires', 'Lycans', 'got', 'so', 'bad', 'Selene', 'Michael', 'hybrid', 'lover', 'opted', 'get', 'town', 'Selene', 'was', 'captured', 'enroute', 'rendezvous', 'Michael', 'taken', 'high', 'security', 'research', 'facility', 'cryogenically', 'frozen', 'ostensibly', 'scientists', 'can', 'conduct', 'tests', 'find', 'cure', 'ominous', 'soundtrack.Twelve', 'years', 'would', 'elapse', 'Selene', 'Subject', 'One', 'icy', 'coffin', 'clutches', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'creepy', 'scientist', 'world', 'now', 'vampire', 'covens', 'Lycan', 'packs', 'have', 'become', 'extinct', 'Selene', 'frantic', 'search', 'Michael', 'derailed', 'when', 'young', 'hybrid', 'vampire-Lycan', 'girl', 'India', 'Eisley', 'whom', 'shares', 'psychic', 'link', 'least', 'film', ""n't"", 'try', 'get', 'coy', 'regarding', 'relationship.The', 'remaining', 'Lycans', 'desperately', 'want', 'claws', 'girl', 'spot', 'DNA', 'harvesting', 'so', 'Selene', 'familiar', 'territory', 'reassuming', 'Death', 'Dealer', 'persona', 'kicking', 'werewolves', 'harshly', 'curb', 'more', 'plot', 'gist', 'narrative', 'one', 'human', 'police', 'detective', 'ally', 'Michael', 'Ealy', 'humans', 'involvement', 'gradually', 'story.You', 'can', 'dismiss', 'franchise', 'can', 'make', 'snarky', 'call', 'B-movie', 'low', 'brow', 'common', 'denominator', 'cheesy', 'such', 'rebuttal', 'alabaster', 'British', 'beauty', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'furiously', 'whuppin', 'butt', 'skin-tight', 'black', 'leather', 'Swedish', 'directing', 'duo', 'Mans', 'Marlind', 'Bjorn', 'Stein', 'were', 'charged', 'bringing', 'UNDERWORLD', 'back', 'big', 'screen', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'shizzy', 'had', 'Beckinsale', 'not', 'come', 'back', 'tour', 'duty', 'Beckinsale', 'cool', 'swagger', 'deadpan', 'determination', 'are', 'what', 'signed', 'sorry', 'Rhona', 'Mitra', 'No', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'level', 'acting', 'minimal', 'certainly', 'not', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'playing', 'Michael', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'again', 'retort', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'classier', 'Alice', 'RESIDENT', 'EVIL', 'yes', 'cool', 'British', 'accent', 'Selene', 'UNDERWORLD', 'films', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'guilty', 'pleasures.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'felt', 'being', 'vampire', 'Selene', 'was', 'lacking', 'certain', 'vampiry', 'traits', 'fact', 'seemed', 'rely', 'overmuch', 'firearms', ""'m"", 'glad', 'get', 'see', 'scene', 'Selene', 'finally', 'bloodily', 'gnaw', 'throat', ""'m"", 'fascinated', 'place', 'vampire', 'hierarchy', 'many', 'accounts', 'regarded', 'traitor', 'species', 'killed', 'two', 'Elder', 'vampires', 'fell', 'love', 'werewolf', 'hybrid', 'be', 'immune', 'sunlight', 'One', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'other', 'nosferatu', 'may', 'eye', 'suspicion', 'Selene', 'own', 'moral', 'code', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'coincide', 'traditional', 'edicts', 'reigning', 'vampire', 'societies.UNDERWORLD', 'AWAKENING', 'unloads', 'scenes', 'blistering', 'action', 'more', 'action', 'also', 'give', '3-D', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'just', 'saw', 'HAYWIRE', 'made', 'mention', 'how', 'sturdy', 'thought', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'was', 'Selene', 'even', 'greater', 'punishment', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'really', 'big', 'bad', 'wolfman', 'how', 'was', 'depicted', 'then', 'eventually', 'defeated', 'India', 'Eisley', 'hybrid', 'teen', 'merits', 'two', 'sequences', 'flexes', 'badassery', 'Werewolf', 'skulls', 'will', 'get', 'split', 'half', 'Other', 'body', 'parts', 'will', 'be', 'cloven', 'two', 'eviscerated', 'just', 'lopped', 'off', 'Fun', 'somewhere', 'way', 'Selene', 'will', 'demonstrate', 'pretty', 'rough', 'way', 'resuscitate', 'dead', 'vampire', 'way', 'film', 'possibility', 'sequel', 'Odds', 'are', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'signing', 'up']",N/A

1373859,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B003Y5H5EW,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[3, 4]","One of the most entertaining things about the first two UNDERWORLD films is that they were actioners through and through. They didn't bother with the ""reality"" of the world; They just gave us the situation: There were Vampires who all dressed like they went to a fetish boutique, and there were Werewolves aka Lycans who were living like the animals of their namesake and both of these mythical creatures had been at war for centures. We followed the adventures of Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a ""death-dealer"" vampire who fell in love with Michael (Scott Speedman), a human who became a hybrid lycan-vampire. Over the course of their forbidden love, they killed both vampires and lycans (well, in all fairness, Selene does 99% of the killing; and despite Michael's supposed ""power"", he barely kills anything) and became hunted by both. Under the direction of Len Wiseman, who did UNDERWORLD and UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION, the story was bloody, wild, exciting, sexy and darned entertaining. Then we got UNDERWORLD: RISE OF THE LYCANS, directed by the great production designer Patrick Tatopolis, and that was a big mess of a prequel designed to shed more light on why the war started and to elaborate on the characters of Lucien (a lycan) and Sonja (a vampire) and their forbidden love. That film was almost unwatchable, and not because it was so bad, but because the film's lighting in almost every scene is so incredibly dark it looks like they shot it entirely in a black hole.Now we have UNDERWORLD: AWAKENING directed by Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein, a Swedish filmmaking duo, and this is their first major studio release. U: A begins with an energetic and shocking opening as humans have discovered the existence of vampires and werewolves and are in the process of exterminating them all. Gone are the days of the fun, comic-booky adventures of orgiastic violence and almost campy intrigue and now we have a film that is trying to hold a mirror up to the human condition. Words like ""Purge"" and ""Cleansing"" are used as Humanity bands together to wipe out these ""sub-human"" monsters. Selene and Michael are trying to escape to safety, but these jack-booted kill squads find them and...The next thing we know is that Selene is in a research lab of the AntiGen Corporation hanging upside-down and naked in cryogenic stasis but is being released by something referred to as Subject Two. Selene, once released, finds all of her old clothes (the latex skintight bodysuit, the cool boots, the leather bustier) just being stored in a glass container. Before you can say ""suspension of disbelief"", she's back to blue-eyed business killing everybody she sees in order to escape and also to find Michael. What she does find is an ally in the impossibly handsome David (Theo James, all cheekbones) and the fact that she's been in stasis for 12 years. We also meet the antagonist, a very Mengele-type big-shot doctor, Jacob Lane (the usually terrific Stephen Rea, trying desperately to keep his face out there), who seems determined to make sure that the government and his own private army get Selene and Subject Two back. We then find that Subject Two is a 12-year-old girl (what a coincidence!) named Eve, who is a hybrid, like Michael (another coincidence!). I won't spoil who she is, but Selene suddenly has a really big reason to protect her. In the midst of all this, David's father Thomas (the great Charles Dance), the leader of a nearby vampire coven, looks to run and hide, and his headstrong son looks to stand their ground and fight against the humans. Then we get a Hulk-sized lycan, a vampire-friendly cop (Michael Ealy), and a really fun final act where all the serious stuff goes out the window in favor of watching Selene blast her way through impossible odds with her twin machine pistols.While the previous films haven't been really big on character development, they did slow down enough to allow some of the newer characters to breathe life into those characters. This is another in the long line of ""We can't make the characters relatable, so at least we'll make them blow stuff up"" action films, like the masters of that kind of cinema (Michael Bay, Roland Emmerich) but with a tenth of the budget they get. My three biggest problems with the film are these:First is that Marlind and Stein seem to be combining the styles of both Wiseman and Tatopolis without any real style of their own. The film does have some pretty fun gags and setpieces like the Wiseman films do, but the film also looks really dark, which may be less of a stylistic choice and more of a symptom of the standard sub-standard lousy 3D post-conversion.Second, the entire cast, with maybe the exception of Beckinsale, seems to be cashing a check here. They don't really do anything interesting or have anything interesting to do other than stand around and glare occasionally. Becks (that's what I call her) knows that this franchise is built around her and she needs to be on her game. The rest of the cast seems to be sleep-walking. And was Wes Bentley just in the neighborhood when they were filming? Because that was a waste of talent and he's certainly not recognizable enough to be a ""cameo"". That was just bizarre.Third, and perhaps the biggest turn-off, is the injection of unnecessary allegorical storytelling that's too much of a reminder of reality to really allow for the same kind of popcorn-munching entertainment that the first two films had going for them. While the first two films were not the breeziest pieces of entertainment, they never took themselves too seriously. With AWAKENING, there's the blasts of violence and energy to the film, but then it's weighed itself down with the persecution of vampires and lycans by humans, some of whom have an interest in creating a more ""superior"" race. Of course, a film with four different screenwriters (one of them being Wiseman himself and another being J. Michael Straczynski, who is best-loved as creating the TV program BABYLON 5, and who is most-hated for really screwing up Spider-Man during his run on the comic book), someone is bound to trip over someone else's ideas. It seems like each writer wrote about 30 pages of the script and then handed it to another writer with a completely different style wanting to tell a completely different story. if you watch the film, you may notice that the tone shifts about seven times throughout the runtime. The allegory within the film is absolutely without any kind of merit since the films themselves were able to sustain themselves simply on the conceit of Vampires vs Werewolves.That being said, the film is pretty entertaining once you get past all the heavy-handedness. Becks continues to rock the outfit VERY well, and while her tone is much more serious here than it's been before, she plays it well. And to be fair to Marlind and Stein here, at least every shot of Selene walking away from the camera isn't shot at buttock-level, like Wiseman (Kate's husband) did constantly. The final act is a lot of fun, except there was one thing (a pretty important thing to be sure, as far as plot is concerned) that I was waiting for that just didn't come, presumably because they're saving it for a sequel.One more thing: The idea of the Hybrid being this all-powerful being was kind of stupid until this film, because we finally see a Hybrid doing a good amount of damage.It's not the most pleasant of universes to step in as far as the New World Order of UNDERWORLD: AWAKENING to visit, and you surely don't want to live there, but it's not an altogether terrible place to visit.",3,"A little TOO heavy-handed at times, but still some fun.",1338076800,"05 27, 2012",2012,7577,"['One', 'most', 'entertaining', 'things', 'first', 'two', 'UNDERWORLD', 'films', 'were',

Vampires battling Lycans to the death, tons of gun play, minimal storyline supported by ample action, and Kate Beckinsale's latex outfit testing the structural integrity of viewers' zippers.  Sure, there is a hybrid daughter storyline used as a first step in the next spiral staircase of this series, and a little subterfuge, but both are actually afterthought in the grand scheme bullets, FX, and latex.The major negatives of this film revolve around lighting and sound.  Adapting to the vampire/night motif is one thing; filming with engine oil over the camera lens during an eclipse is something completely different.  In other words, tons of scenes - some major actions sequences - too dark to discern.  The sound is equally egregious.  There are large stretches of filming with a distracting bass rumble that not only detracts from the overall viewing pleasure, but also causes headaches.  Hint: Every once in a while move your hand to the other side of the synthesizer.Diehard fans of the series will enjoy the film immensely.

1373867,A2GBBDNZLYC4A9,B003Y5H5EW,"Jeff Johnson ""Jeff Johnson""","[0, 2]","Get ready Underworld fans to hate this review. The Underworld franchise has been on a downward slope since the first one and this was the worst. Sure it still maintains the same Kate Beckinsale in the same slick black tight suit looking impervious to everything including bullets and claws. The movie is soaked in darkness, tones of blue and gore. Don't think you'll see any green here, just blue with hints of red splattered blood. The plot is paper thin like an 80s movie of having Arnold Swartzenager invade a compound and kill everyone. Well this movie Kate invades a compound and kills werewolves like she's an exterminator. Why? For a new girl that joins the cast and doesn't seem to have much to do with anything. It feels tacked on like they couldn't have her save her beloved boyfriend again. This is a cool and gory movie without much substance. Terrible dialog and even worse logic like how would a girl raised in a lab know what a mom and dad are to even know who her mom and dad are? Why would the fiendish lycan company bent on using this kid even tell the kid what a mom and dad are? Why bother teaching her English? Whatever. The girl doesn't even show up until 30+ minutes into the movie making me wonder why everyone is willing to instantly die for her. Everything seems thrown together with no cohesion. I'm not exactly why Kate is trying to save the girl other than the obvious she's Kate's daughter but Kate doesn't remember having her.The movie excels at cool, gorey deaths and action... but so much of it that you grow numb by the end. The body count is probably near 100, but Kate remains unharmed. Its like watching Superman in a woman's body who can't fly with bad dialog. In fact she even brings someone back to life by touching his heart literally. Speaking of plunging her hand into someone's stomach to get to their chest... when she does it, there is no blood on her snow white hand afterward.I'd probably feel different about the movie if any of the cast could convey any sort of emotion other than brooding badassery. Not even the child can convey some sense of weakness or emotion, she's too busy killing everyone too! Maybe that's just the vampire stereotype that they have no emotion... just like there is a stereotype that vampires hate sunlight, yet Kate Beckinsale can be out there in the daytime because 'it because it was a gift.' If only this character wasn't Superman. If only she had any kind of weakness or frailty. Even Superman has kryptonite, Indiana Jones had snakes, even the Terminator can be killed. Heck you can even strip her of her automatic pistol to show some sign of weakness. Pretty easy to kill lycan when all vampires are equipped with pistols and all werewolves are just brutish beasts without weapons.Pass this movie unless you need a good laugh and eye roll. I just can't suspend my disbelief this much.

Apparently Selene has given Michael a daughter, which neither of them gets to meet for twelve years due to being captured and cryogenically caged.  We aren't shown an intimate copulation scene, so it is possible gene splicing in a laboratory was done in vitro style.  This clearly is a stepping stone into what is hoped by the producers to be a very lucrative and long term franchise.  I may only be one fan, but I'm going to suggest that they don't make special FX more affordable by using foggy darkness and blurred camera shots.  Obviously vampires don't need a lot of light to git-r-done, and lycans aren't given to requiring light either; however, YOUR  VIEWERS DO ya morons.  This sequel is a pitiful example of reclining upon the laurels of past accomplishments, using similar themes and exploiting Kate Beckinsale's physical attraction so thoroughly I'm surprised she wasn't wrung out like she'd been through a juicer.  I'm losing interest in the ""Underworld"" series after seeing how the producers are short-sheeting their fans in this latest film.  When I started watching the series in 2003, I was very eager to get my hands on ""Evolution,"" and ""Rise of the Lycans.""  I pre-ordered this 4th sequel, ""Awakening"" hoping it would continue to build on how intensely amazing the first three were.  Please don't spend all the budget on red epic 3-D camera gadgetry.  How can something that starts out so great end up so mediocre??  The producers are still over $177 million in the black, from the first four in this series, and need to re-invest some of it.  I will give them one more chance, but if ""Underworld"" sequel five sags from the first four like ""Awakening"" did from the first three, this fan is done, regardless of how tight Kate Beckinsale's latex cat suit gets.

Yeah, it does.*Mini-Spoilers Alert*Humans have learned of the existence of vamps and lycans, and reacted predictably badly to the news.  Selene gets captured while she and Michael trying to escape the carnage and she awakens twelve years later in a specimen lab at a company called AntiGen and escapes, vaguely aware that someone called Specimen 2 (India Eisley) aided her.  Contacted by David (Theo James), a member of a ragtag coven of surviving vamps, she discovers the truth of her situation: Specimen 2 is her biological daughter and they were being experimented upon for reasons both obvious and not so much. Dr. Jacob Lane (Stephen Rea), head of AntiGen, who claims to be working on a vaccine for the lycan/vampire strains, has a different endgame in mind.  Thwarted by AntiGen's stonewalling after Selene's escape, Detective Sebastian (Michael Ealy) is also hot on her trail, having his own reasons for tracking her down.*End Spoilers*Much like Resident Evil, this is a franchise that's starting to run on fumes and needs a new jolt.  U:A does so, but like other flicks in the genre, the fault lies more in the execution.  Humans learning about lycans and vamps is just what was needed here, but letting us see the downfall of the two groups as it happened would've made a better story than catching up after the fact.Cinematography and art design remain the same: oversaturated blue palettes for everything, all the time.  Plus lots of rain-washed city streets in the night, sterile lab rooms, dank & cold caverns and tunnels- all lovingly rendered in a gothic shade of blue.  Even the sunshine.Blood and gore are ok, but inconsistent.  Half the time everyone, including the central cast, looked like they took shooting lessons at Mook Central:  too many times a person is standing stock still yet the bullet holes keep decorating the walls and surroundings (think Pulp Fiction when the guy tried to shoot Jules and Vincent).  But it's got eviscerations, lacerations and gougings galore- it'll sate your blood lust, don't you worry.Dialogue gets utterly cheesy at times but it was never supposed to be Shakespeare, was it?  I'm just finding it hard to believe that J. Michael Straczynski had a hand in the script.  The cast is interesting for it's selection, but let's face it- all they're being called upon to do is snarl, growl, sneer, angst, and in some cases, die in a CGI rendering.  Nice work if you can get it.  :)  Notably absent is Scott Speedman, who has declined to reprise his role in the series (as yet), but his character gets a cameo to support the story.Only real question I have is the soundtrack.  None of the songs even appear until after the credits start rolling, so what's the point of having Lacuna Coil & Evanscence around if you don't use them?U:A is the kick start the series needed.  It's a popcorn flick with enough chops to hold down a spot in both the urban fantasy genre and the franchise itself.

1373884,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B003Y5H5EW,John's Horror Corner,"[123, 147]","Thank God!  Beckinsale returns.  I had no difficulty watching Rhona Mitra, but Rise of the Lycans just hurt me.  I hate seeing non-returning actors replaced.  Yes, I know her character (Selene) wasn't even in the prequel, but I still thought the amputation of Beckensale would leave the franchise forever bitter and crippled from making new sequels.  And while filled with action, I struggled with the drop in CGI quality, especially for backgrounds.  But have no fear.  The budget is back, and it brought Beckensale with it.  The franchise is redeemed and primed for more sequels.After a quick recap of the first two movies' events, we are introduced to a near-future in which the vampires and lycans (werewolves) have been discovered by humans.  It is acknowledged in the movie that `now these nonhumans are more than myth' and, not surprisingly given human nature, the humans militarized a ""cleansing"" to eradicate the vampires and lycans.  In this middle of all this Selene (Beckinsale) is captured and cryogenically frozen.  This is where the background ends and this story begins.Selene is freed from her cryo-chamber after being helped by some unseen (presumably) nonhuman and escapes an extremely well-guarded research facility.  Conveniently, the her scientist-captors left all of her tight, shiny leather outfit in some chemical cabinets, so she was quick to find her normal form.  During her escape she encounters some thought-to-be-eradicated lycans and a little vamp-lycan hybrid adolescent--she's pretty tough and gets some cool action scenes.  This little girl seems to be the center of story because the lycans REALLY want her.The plot is quite weak; borderline pointless.  But that didn't bother me a bit.  Like the first two installments of the franchise, this flick cluster-bombs viewers with exciting action sequences, flesh-shredding assaults, people being slam-launched across the room into walls, a healthy dose of blood splattering, and some occasional creative acrobatics.  Oh, and watch out for the really, really, big bad wolf.  The lycans genetically engineered this mega-lycan that is around 12-15 feet tall and probably weighs a couple tons.  The fight scenes between MegaLycan and Selene are very exciting, brutal, bashy, gritty... The other action scenes are fun, too.  Including a lycan-on-foot car chase, some mass melees, and some spiffy close-quarters combat.  If you came with no care for plot and every care for mindless action, then this flick is most certainly for you.In the end I was thrilled with the production value, action-filming and set design--all of which were less impressive in Rise of the Lycans.  The effects budget seemed to be lower than it was for Underworld: Evolution (the best effects of the franchise in my opinion), but to no fault.  This is one of those ""movies for guys who like movies"" action flicks and one really wouldn't suffer for not seeing the prequels.  But you should definitely watch them anyway!",5,The Underworld franchise is redeemed after temporary loss of Beckensale.

I was a little skeptical at first being that this is the 4th in the Underworld film series and, well, as we all know, sequels can be terrible the majority of the time. I am a big fan of the Underworld series and this does not disappoint any fan of the series.  I was fortunate enough to see the film in the theater and I was also fortunate to see it in it's intended format of 3D using the ultra modern 3D filming techniques, which add's incredible depth and perspective to the movie.  In it's intended format, it really envelopes you in the movie experience.  You almost feel as if you are there, and that's no exaggeration, it was simply incredible the way this movie was filmed.  I wish all the Underworld movies had been filmed this way, unfortunately, the technology was not available when the first films in the series were made.  Kate Beckinsale is, as always, fantastic in her portrayal as Selene.  I have always been a fan of Stephen Rea, who is one of the best actors on this planet, period!  He gives a good performance in this movie as a mad doctor obsessed with getting rid of the Vamps and increasing the Lycan's abilities in the new modern era.  India Eisley also gives a good performance as ""Eve"", the love child of Michael and Selene.  This movie has a LOT of action in it, more than the previous films in my opinion.  I like the first film in the Underworld films the best, no question, but this film is good and most people should enjoy it, especially any fan of the series.  I truly hope they continue making the Underworld movies.  I think, overall, the producers, film makers, directors, actors, and everyone involved with making the Underworld series has done a great job keeping them blended together, even with different variations of the four films that have been made.  There is so many different ways that this series could go and different directions and stories that it could take.  PLEASE make more of these films.  The four films already made did very well in the box office and even better with their DVD sales around the world.  It is a good series and it's something that the fans definitely want continued for at LEAST a few more films.  I'm not sure I would do a television series and that seems to be the demise of any film series.  Just continue making really great films and this series could continue on for many years.",4,Underworld Awakening,1335830400,"05 1, 2012",2012,2418,"['Overall', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Underworld', 'Awakening', 'was', 'little', 'skeptical', 'first', 'being', '4th', 'Underworld', 'film', 'series', 'well', 'know', 'sequels', 'can', 'be', 'terrible', 'majority', 'time', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Underworld', 'series', 'not', 'disappoint', 'fan', 'series', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'film', 'theater', 'was', 'also', 'fortunate', 'see', 'intended', 'format', '3D', 'using', 'ultra', 'modern', '3D', 'filming', 'techniques', 'add', 'incredible', 'depth', 'perspective', 'movie', 'intended', 'format', 'really', 'movie', 'experience', 'almost', 'feel', 'are', 'there', 'exaggeration', 'was', 'simply', 'incredible', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'wish', 'Underworld', 'movies', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'way', 'unfortunately', 'technology', 'was', 'not', 'available', 'when', 'first', 'films', 'series', 'were', 'made', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'always', 'fantastic', 'portrayal', 'Selene', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'who', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'planet', 'period', 'good', 'performance', 'movie', 'mad', 'doctor', 'obsessed', 'getting', 'rid', 'Vamps', 'increasing', 'Lycan', 'abilities', 'new', 'modern', 'era', 'India', 'Eisley', 'also', 'good', 'performance', 'Eve', 'love', 'child', 'Michael', 'Selene', 'movie', 'LOT', 'action', 'more', 'previous', 'films', 'opinion', 'first', 'film', 'Underworld', 'best', 'question', 'film', 'good', 'most', 'people', 'should', 'enjoy', 'especially', 'fan', 'series', 'truly', 'hope', 'continue', 'making', 'Underworld', 'movies', 'think', 'overall', 'producers', 'film', 'makers', 'directors', 'actors', 'everyone', 'involved', 'making', 'Underworld', 'series', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'keeping', 'blended', 'together', 'even', 'different', 'variations', 'four', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'series', 'could', 'go', 'different', 'directions', 'stories', 'could', 'take', 'PLEASE', 'make', 'more', 'films', 'four', 'films', 'already', 'made', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'even', 'better', 'DVD', 'sales', 'world', 'good', 'series', 'something', 'fans', 'definitely', 'want', 'continued', 'LEAST', 'few', 'more', 'films', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'do', 'television', 'series', 'be', 'demise', 'film', 'series', 'Just', 'continue', 'making', 'really', 'great', 'films', 'series', 'could', 'continue', 'many', 'years']",N/A

This came to the theatres for one week in January 2012, but I skipped it then. Then I bought the DVD in May 2013. In this installment Selene somehow got captured, as was Michael -- and frozen for 12 years. And somehow she got a daughter though her pregnancy was barely mentioned in Evolution (2005). Too many plot holes. At first it seems humans were on a campaign to exterminate all the vampires and lycans, but Stephen Rea's Antigen Corp. is secretly turning humans into super lycans -- though why is not explained, nor how, except through injections. Antigen claims to be researching for a cure but really wants to create a super race of giant lycans -- an idea found in the Alien films, and many others.The search for a super soldier, superman is a cliche done far too many times.Meanwhile Eva, daughter of Selene, releases Selene and both escape. Much chasing around. Selene finds another vampire, David, and he leads her to coven under a dam. Here we meet all that is left of the vampires. Led by Thomas (Charles Dance), who doesn't want to fight anymore. But Selene, who only knows fighting, starts more fights, underground, as the super lycans invade. Movie shifts to a simple war between lycans and humans. The scientists at Antigen all turn out to be lycans in disguise. The lycans kidnap Eva back and once again Selene goes to Antigen Corp. to get her out of there yet again. Long fight about that extraction. She has help from a human cop -- not much -- but she finds some humans who want to help the vampires. In the end she finds Michael frozen, she shoots at the chamber, goes back to fighting the superlycans and in the final scene goes back to find Michael and he is gone. The surviving lycans took him - up on the roof and escaped by helicopter. All this wide open for a sequel. Was one ever made? Should they?The film got severely hammered by reviews posted on IMDb and was exhibited for a week in the theatre. Previous Underworld films were: Underworld (2003), Underworld Evolution (2005), which were linked, Underworld Rise of the Lycans (2009), a prequel.Got mainly because I had the others in the series, and to see Kate running around in that black costume (probably latex, not leather).

She has been held upside down is some cryogenic capsule for 12 years.  She manages to escape thanks to some mysterious person, and here comes the good part.  She finds her black boots and black leatherette outfit.  That alone is cause for applause.The rest of the film you've seen before.  It turns out that a 12 year old girl (do the math) has been held captive by an underground werewolf colony.  She's rescued by Selena - who has done the math - and a new hunky vampire (Theo James).  The werewolves are headed by scientist Dr. Lane (Stephen Rea) who has turned his son into some super duper giant sized wolf.  Plenty `o guts are expelled over the 88 minute running time.  I guess we'll have to wait for yet another installment to find out what kind of powers young Eve (India Eisley) might possess.Another thing going for it is the spectacular Blu ray transfer.  In 1080p and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio, you can't ask for much more, assuming your display can handle it.  Blacks are really black.  The detail is excellent.  No complaints.

The CGI looks great and there is more action than the all the other films combined. If you want blood filled action, you'll pretty much get it from start to finish. The story is okay, with a couple of twists that caught me by surprise, and the acting is good for this type of film. The beyond gorgeous Kate Beckinsale stills rocks the role of Selene. I really hope she comes back for a fifth installment.The IMAX 3-D was not really worth the upgrade, but I had no choice at my theater. The sound was great, even making the seats shake, but at least the 3-D wasn't a blurry mess that took away from the movie.Now my 5 star rating is in context with the Underworld series, not comparable say to my 5 star review of The Dark Knight.

1373951,A1UEIAIRVH070I,B003Y5H5EW,"Neal ""MerlinFL""","[1, 3]","I waited to see this movie because it was so short on running time that I could not feel good about paying the same price for movies at least 30 mins longer or more that are just as enjoyable on the big screen.  That is just the practical side of my ideas about spending my money on films.I can only hope that this ""movie"" which is only 1:22 not including the credits which are almost 10 minutes long with at least three different hairdressers listed in three different locations on the credits roll just for Ms. Beckinsale.  Whoa, that's a lot of hair manipulation for someone with a short hair style.  I wonder how many ""Trinity"" had with the change from greased down to short and scruffy?  And it's not just that, but it seems that there are literally three entire sets of credits from the Gaffers and Grips to the CGI & FX makeup teams.  I was also surprise that Ms. Beckinsale had not one dime of her own money into this project since the franchise has been a successful one.But now onto the movie itself...  WARNING WARNING - SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!As I said - I can only hope this is a long teaser for a new cycle of movies with or without Ms. Beckinsale.  She is starting to get along in years and playing an immortal character that does not age or get more ""mature looking"" has got to be considered if the stories are to continue as well if Scott Speedman is no longer going to be the other leading immortal character of Michael Corvinus (sp?)The story shows Selene getting blown apart from her man Michael by some sort of UV grenade by the mortal police forces in the beginning. We next see her frozen (tastefully not naked although very obviously nude in the container) with very well place fog and other obstacles, escaping with some help from a cyro-freezer after what turns out to be 12 years into a world without Lycans, and very few Vampires.  It's told that she (Selene) is labeled Patient #1 as it blares across the warning system.  And that she has ""some sort of"" special connection and link with patient #2. It's announced that both can each see through the eyes of the other.  Naturally we the audience thinks it is Michael who is patient #2.  But it's actually Selene's 12 year old daughter who is a human-hybrid mostly looking like Michael with the blue/black eyes and nearly black skin color change.  She's never been outside, never fed as a Vampire, etc.  But she knows she's Mom when she sees her and vice-versa.Those familiar with the first two movies which of the three are the only ones with Selene in them and time line is from the beginning of movie 1 thru the end of movie 2.  One long storyline which I thought worked very well.  I'm just trying to keep with Selene/Michael for this is long enough already.Here are just a few of the many things I have a problem with in this movie...1) Vampires are ""dead"" beings, they cannot have children - yet Selene has a child during her 12 years of being captured and frozen.2) Michael did ""die"" in the middle of movie 2 but Selene fed him blood that she had after being given the 100% ""pure blood"" of the first of both sides of the immortal creatures in this storyline ""Grandpa""  Corvinus himself (such a nice guy for an immortal who did nothing except have more money than can be counted, hire very loyal people to ""clean up"" Vampire and Lycan ""messes"", etc. and allowed himself to be killed by his Vampire son.) which gave her enough strength to beat the first Vampire ever who would be the strongest as in this storyline age equals abilities and strength as well as the blood it comes from....However, since Michael died, he might have been brought back, but he was brought back in the Vampire way of becoming UNdead.  Not alive as he found out when trying to eat solid food which caused him great physical pain - this was shown in the first movie when he was just Lycan.  So - how can two dead people produce a child???  This is one BIG problem for me and nothing was even mentioned about it in this movie.Then we see the Vampires are actually far worse off than the Lycans, because the Lycans kept themselves hidden during the 1st & 2nd ""Purge"" as the movie calls the human eradication of all Lycans and Vampires.  Really??  That must have been one bunch of sissy Vampires with no elders to lead them to be decimated to near extinction by humans.  Same for the Lycans or so everyone thought, but nope...the Lycans in the great tradition of Lucian.  Sneaky and seemingly much smarter when it comes to staying alive and powerful. Now we have Dinosaur sized Lycan due to years of experimentation by the Lycans who were thought to be humans using the blood of Selene, of daughter and yep - you guessed the ending...Michael.  The first Lycan Vampire hybrid which would make him extremely powerful, but the daughter has BOTH original Corvinus blood which makes her immune to Daylight, as well as Silver, and pretty much everything else that would destroy typical Vampires and Werewolves.So now we have the ultimate undead family of good hearted, but very fierce, Uber-Vampire Selene aka Mom, 1st hybrid Lycan that all other Lycans were supposed to yield to as shown in the ending of the first movie, and the Uber being with everything on the positive side for being powerful with not one single weakness...Mama & Daddy's little girl.  And with all that, it's very possible that she is also a triple threat - the daughter I think is mostly plain ole human on top of the duality of being a hybrid Lycan/Vampire.  One older doctor Vampire Lady was looking for her original bite marks and couldn't find any.  Of course not, she wasn't turned, she was...born???  How exactly did that happen, or is this a test-tube kinda thing??  Again...no idea from this movie.And all this with no real explanations about most things that had happened in 12 years of Cryo-Sleep (hmmm - ""Ripley"" was asleep for 57 years), lots of very good FX, some excellent fight scenes and very excellence kill shots and other well done gore FX.  Now what?Yes - all that I typed just to sum up what this movie only put into motion with an ending that certainly screams...NEXT MOVIE COMING UP!!  But who, where, what, why, etc., etc.  It's all set in the near future, but if Selene's last thoughts were of getting the Vampires back to the top of the food chain and powerful and a collective nation...Doesn't this seem a bit much like Blade 2 or 3 except that the Vampires are the ""good guys""?Did this help or just make everything much more confusing?",4,"Liked it for what it was, but...

Good 3D in Underworld Awakening. When the movie starts, it's in 2D highlighting the previous films, but then it switches to 3D and wow. For 3D, I consider it great when the foreground, mid ground and background pop very clearly from one another in depth so there's no mistake it's 3D. This is clearly the case with Underworld Awakening during many scenes, but sometimes, the 3D pales and looks a bit flat during non action moments.

Humans discover the existence of the immortals, and react in a predictably human fashion: they try to wipe them out.The film did a great job carrying on the story. Everything still makes sense, and none of the ""rules"" of the world are changed. Vampires still hate lycans, lycans still hate vampires. We just have a new dimension added -- humans hate vampires and lycans. The ""mood"" of the earlier films hasn't changed much here either...this is very much a dark, somber atmosphere. Michael is notably absent, but (don't worry!) it's handled well. The new characters fit nicely into the Underworld world, and no one seems out of place. The story itself was good, and they were careful to make sure that it continued everything we've seen in the first movies.The acting was all great, and Kate Beckinsdale did a(nother) superb job...she has a great way of conveying emotion with very understated expressions and tones.Another aspect that I liked about this film...up until this point, with two exceptions (Sonya and Celine), we've seen pretty much nothing but evil vampires; werewolves, by contrast, have grown vengeful, but are justified in their quest for vengeance. Lycans are ""regular people"" who have been changed, hunted and abused, but vampires are the abusers and hunters. There is nothing very likeable the vampires, with the exception of Sonya and Celine -- at best they have been happy to profit off other's misery, and, at worst, they contribute to it. Here we see more ""human"" vampires...not perfect, but not horribly evil either.All in all, 5/5 stars -- another great addition to the series.",5,The war continues...,1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,1731,"['Awakening', 'up', 'where', 'Evolution', 'left', 'off', 'Alexander', 'Corvinus', 'dead', 'now', 'one', 'cleaning', 'up', 'offspring', 'Humans', 'discover', 'existence', 'immortals', 'react', 'predictably', 'human', 'fashion', 'try', 'wipe', 'out.The', 'film', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'carrying', 'story', 'Everything', 'still', 'sense', 'none', 'rules', 'world', 'are', 'changed', 'Vampires', 'still', 'hate', 'lycans', 'lycans', 'still', 'hate', 'vampires', 'just', 'have', 'new', 'dimension', 'added', 'humans', 'hate', 'vampires', 'lycans', 'mood', 'earlier', 'films', ""n't"", 'changed', 'much', 'here', 'either', 'very', 'much', 'dark', 'somber', 'atmosphere', 'Michael', 'notably', 'absent', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'handled', 'well', 'new', 'characters', 'fit', 'nicely', 'Underworld', 'world', 'one', 'place', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'were', 'careful', 'make', 'sure', 'continued', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'movies.The', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'Kate', 'Beckinsdale', 'did', 'nother', 'superb', 'job', 'great', 'way', 'conveying', 'emotion', 'very', 'understated', 'expressions', 'tones.Another', 'aspect', 'liked', 'film', 'up', 'point', 'two', 'exceptions', 'Sonya', 'Celine', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'pretty', 'much', 'nothing', 'evil', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'contrast', 'have', 'grown', 'vengeful', 'are', 'justified', 'quest', 'vengeance', 'Lycans', 'are', 'regular', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'hunted', 'abused', 'vampires', 'are', 'abusers', 'hunters', 'nothing', 'very', 'likeable', 'vampires', 'exception', 'Sonya', 'Celine', 'best', 'have', 'been', 'happy', 'profit', 'off', 'other', 'misery', 'worst', 'contribute', 'Here', 'see', 'more', 'human', 'vampires', 'not', 'perfect', 'not', 'horribly', 'evil', 'either.All', '5/5', 'stars', 'great', 'addition', 'series']",N/A

I believe the goal of any sequel should be to improve on the story and continue to develop the characters, rather than to simply exploit the popularity of earlier installments to make a buck.

It was interesting to see the werewolves in control, getting the upper hand, but the story lacked a substance. There was hardly any meat on these offered bones.

Trying to avoid spoilage, but this series really suffers without a romance central to the plot. The movie starts with Selene and Michael trying to escape from humans who are awake to their presence and determined to eradicate vampires and werewolves. Then it jumps twelve years into the future, where Selene has to catch up to current events before events catch up to her in the form of the scientists who have apparently been studying her while she was in some kind of cryo-sleep. India Eisley joins the cast as another test subject whose identity will probably not surprise anyone in the audience. Stephen Rea also stars as the head scientist, and his true agenda was actually a welcome surprise. Michael Ealy gets far too little screen time as a human detective with a story of his own, and Theo James brings some enjoyable eye candy but no romantic tension. Sandrine Holt is also very good in the few scenes she gets, and if you're familiar with Kris Holden-Reid's work you'll get a kick out of him here. There are some dysfunctional family subplots, but they aren't developed as thoroughly here as in previous outings. The cast is great, the twists are pretty good, and the action sequences are better than ever, but there is just too little plot developed in too short a time, and without the doomed romance that has up til now been central to these movies, there is a lot of pathos missing.

Michael Straczynski is one board this time around as a co-writer,and as everyone knows was the genius behind one of the best Sci Fi series ever to grace the boob tube:Babylon 5.There is a small problem I have though with the story and that is the daughter,or did I miss something? My question is just how did she come to be? We know of course Michael and Selene were intimate but how the daughter was born in a laboratory,kind of stretches things;at least without some kind of hint.Was Selene actually pregnant when she was captured or did the lab artificially impregnate her during the freezing? But that would mean she'd have to been unthawed somewhere along the line for nine months.Or was the daughter born outside of Selene's womb? Many questions,no answers or hint of one.Would an extended version have at least given us a clue or will there be some type of answer in the next film? We will see.Until then,it is an unsettling part of the story,and I don't like loose ends like this,especially in a storyline of such complexity.Technically the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.The only extra is commentary.Not a bad addition to the franchise,with Kate back in the saddle again...finally.It is a shorter than normal film(the shortest of the franchise)coming in around 80 minutes.It does move nicely and the action is strong throughout.I have a problem with the addition of Selene's daughter and her origins,which is not explained at all and which we must except on face value.Not good.An above average flick and recommended.",4,"3 1/2 -4 stars,as the franchise comes back a little stronger",1348012800,"09 19, 2012",2012,4093,"['Underworld', 'Awakening', 'released', 'Jan/12', 'franchise', 'latest', 'incarnation.It', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Selene', 'front', 'center', 'once', 'more', 'where', 'kicking', 'vampire', 'lycan', 'butt.Ms.Beckinsale', 'seamlessly', 'back', 'character', 'physically', 'mentally.Starring', 'along', 'Kate', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'head', 'Antigen', 'lab', 'Kate', 'prisoner', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'vampire', 'elder', 'good', 'assortment', 'other', 'supporting', 'cast', 'members.The', 'film', 'recap', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'led', 'circumstances', 'one', 'from.The', 'human', 'world', 'now', 'become', 'aware', 'lycan/vampire', 'threat', 'done', 'major', 'purges', 'rid', 'scourges.Selene', 'lover', 'hybrid', 'Michael', 'fallen', 'city', 'river', 'Kate', 'jumps', 'him.The', 'authorities', 'throw', 'bomb', 'when', 'waters', 'are', 'captured.They', 'remain', 'frozen', 'Antigen', 'laboratories', 'head', 'son', 'are', 'lycans', 'disguise.Kate', 'one', 'day', 'inexplicably', 'thawed', 'out', 'laboratories.During', 'flight', 'vampire', 'also', 'young', 'girl', 'huddling', 'sewers', 'lycans', 'vicinity.She', 'lycans', 'meeting', 'young', 'girl', 'was', 'unthawed', 'labs', 'was', 'also', 'test', 'subject', 'Selene', 'daughter', 'later', 'learned', 'hybrid', 'more', 'powerful', 'Selene', 'Michael', 'put', 'together.Selene', 'daughter', 'flee', 'local', 'vampire', 'coven', 'where', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'welcomed', 'leader.When', 'place', 'raided', 'assumed', 'humans', 'strangely', 'out', 'be', 'lycans.As', 'plot', 'action', 'further', 'unfold', 'learned', 'head', 'Antigen', 'labs', 'sent', 'retrieve', 'Selene', 'blood', 'needed', 'produce', 'super', 'serum', 'resistant', 'silver.Selene', 'daughter', 'inevitably', 'captured', 'Selene', 'must', 'storm', 'labs', 'rescue', 'process', 'cryogenically', 'frozen', 'body', 'Michael', 'who', 'was', 'assumed', 'was', 'dead.She', 'time', 'put', 'bullet', 'hole', 'chamber', 'then', 'flee.When', 'final', 'battle', 'finishes', 'Selene', 'daughter', 'vision', 'fathers', 'eyes', 'roof', 'time', 'get', 'there', 'fled.The', 'film', 'fades', 'out', 'Selene', 'new', 'mission', 'known', 'take', 'back', 'world', 'humans', 'lycans', 'reunite', 'Michael.The', 'plot', 'good', 'one', 'plenty', 'action', 'body', 'count', 'unseen', 'previous', 'Underworlds', 'saying', 'something.J', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'one', 'board', 'time', 'around', 'co-writer', 'everyone', 'was', 'genius', 'one', 'best', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'series', 'ever', 'grace', 'boob', 'tube', 'Babylon', '5.There', 'small', 'problem', 'have', 'though', 'story', 'daughter', 'did', 'miss', 'something', 'question', 'just', 'how', 'did', 'come', 'be', 'know', 'course', 'Michael', 'Selene', 'were', 'intimate', 'how', 'daughter', 'was', 'born', 'laboratory', 'kind', 'stretches', 'things', 'least', 'kind', 'hint.Was', 'Selene', 'actually', 'pregnant', 'when', 'was', 'captured', 'did', 'lab', 'artificially', 'impregnate', 'freezing', 'would', 'mean', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'unthawed', 'somewhere', 'line', 'nine', 'months.Or', 'was', 'daughter', 'born', 'Selene', 'womb', 'Many', 'questions', 'answers', 'hint', 'one.Would', 'extended', 'version', 'have', 'least', 'given', 'clue', 'will', 'there', 'be', 'type', 'answer', 'next', 'film', 'will', 'see.Until', 'then', 'unsettling', 'part', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'loose', 'ends', 'especially', 'storyline', 'such', 'complexity.Technically', 'film', 'w/s', 'a/r', '2:40:1', 'clear', 'only', 'extra', 'commentary.Not', 'bad', 'addition', 'franchise', 'Kate', 'back', 'saddle', 'again', 'finally.It', 'shorter', 'normal', 'film', 'shortest', 'franchise', 'coming', '80', 'minutes.It', 'move', 'nicely', 'action', 'strong', 'throughout.I', 'have', 'problem', 'addition', 'Selene', 'daughter', 'origins', 'not', 'explained', 'must', 'except', 'face', 'value.Not', 'good.An', 'average', 'flick', 'recommended']",N/A

Awakening does not cover that period, instead it picks up 12 or so years after. What follows is a convulted plot that does answer most of the questions hardcore viewers are wondering about. The movie attempts to be a mysterious, but it fails to do so and just leaves you wondering why Kate B. would sign off on this drivel.

1373999,A2VX0PZ1ZDWVDR,B003Y5H5EW,ScottDel,"[7, 10]","I watched Underworld Awakening with low expectations because I'd heard it had low reviews.I was expecting fun action but didn't know if there would be any story or characterization to go with it.I was extremely disappointed with Rise of the Lycans and felt that story idea was a great story that could've have been told allot more powerfully.So I was concerned about the quality level of Underworld Awakening. I thought it might do a disservice to the original Underworld ethos.I was pleasantly surprised. Underworld Awakening is an engaging and suspenseful action movie from the beginning.It is everything an action movie should be and the action and related suspense is well done.But it is more than just meaningless action. It has a good story to it.The desires and motivations of the characters are well portrayed. There are a number of surprises and plot twists as well.What I'm trying to say is that the action is driven by the motivation, desires and emotions of Selene and the other characters.The movie does move at a frenetic, breakneck pace but there is depth in the story, not just meaningless action.I've seen plenty of meaningless, banal action movies and I detest them so I'm not one who is quick to praise every action movie just because of the ""wow"" factor.I require more than explosions, spectacular fight scenes and action. I require that there be a story and that there be characterization, that the movie has depth. And good directing is really nice and rather essential too.Don't believe the poor reviews of this movie. Those people simply don't understand it or mistake it for something else.If you liked the first Underworld movie, you'll like this one.If you liked the sequel you'll love this one.I thought the sequel to Underworld was okay and a bit of a letdown in some ways, however still possessing good qualities. But this movie, in my mind, captures the magic of the original movie, albeit in a different way.I think some people are put off by the pace of the movie, that the whole movie takes place in no more than 2 to 3 days.That isn't a problem for me.Bottom line:The story carries the action and makes this movie meaningful, enjoyable and satisfying.If there is a sequel to this one (and the ending of Awakening begs for a sequel) I hope it is a well directed, well scripted movie that the creators take seriously and not just driven by hollywood greed.Excellent movie - Don't believe the poor reviewers - Highly recommended.",4,Excellent,1336435200,"05 8, 2012",2012,2461,"['watched', 'Underworld', 'Awakening', 'low', 'expectations', ""'d"", 'heard', 'had', 'low', 'reviews.I', 'was', 'expecting', 'fun', 'action', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'be', 'story', 'characterization', 'go', 'it.I', 'was', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'Rise', 'Lycans', 'felt', 'story', 'idea', 'was', 'great', 'story', 'could', ""'ve"", 'have', 'been', 'told', 'allot', 'more', 'powerfully.So', 'was', 'concerned', 'quality', 'level', 'Underworld', 'Awakening', 'thought', 'might', 'do', 'disservice', 'original', 'Underworld', 'ethos.I', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Underworld', 'Awakening', 'engaging', 'suspenseful', 'action', 'movie', 'beginning.It', 'everything', 'action', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'action', 'related', 'suspense', 'well', 'done.But', 'more', 'just', 'meaningless', 'action', 'good', 'story', 'it.The', 'desires', 'motivations', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'portrayed', 'are', 'number', 'surprises', 'plot', 'twists', ""'m"", 'trying', 'say', 'action', 'driven', 'motivation', 'desires', 'emotions', 'Selene', 'other', 'characters.The', 'movie', 'move', 'frenetic', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'depth', 'story', 'not', 'just', 'meaningless', 'action.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plenty', 'meaningless', 'banal', 'action', 'movies', 'detest', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'who', 'quick', 'praise', 'action', 'movie', 'just', 'wow', 'factor.I', 'require', 'more', 'explosions', 'spectacular', 'fight', 'scenes', 'action', 'require', 'be', 'story', 'be', 'characterization', 'movie', 'depth', 'good', 'directing', 'really', 'nice', 'rather', 'essential', 'too.Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'poor', 'reviews', 'movie', 'people', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'mistake', 'something', 'else.If', 'liked', 'first', 'Underworld', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'like', 'one.If', 'liked', 'sequel', ""'ll"", 'love', 'one.I', 'thought', 'sequel', 'Underworld', 'was', 'okay', 'bit', 'letdown', 'ways', 'however', 'still', 'possessing', 'good', 'qualities', 'movie', 'mind', 'magic', 'original', 'movie', 'albeit', 'different', 'way.I', 'think', 'people', 'are', 'put', 'off', 'pace', 'movie', 'whole', 'movie', 'place', 'more', '2', '3', 'days.That', ""n't"", 'problem', 'me.Bottom', 'line', 'story', 'action', 'movie', 'meaningful', 'enjoyable', 'satisfying.If', 'sequel', 'one', 'ending', 'Awakening', 'begs', 'sequel', 'hope', 'well', 'directed', 'well', 'scripted', 'movie', 'creators', 'take', 'seriously', 'not', 'just', 'driven', 'hollywood', 'greed.Excellent', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'poor', 'reviewers', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

The Underworld series as a whole are interesting, with some nice spins on the traditional vampire/werewolf traditions.  Kris Holden-Ried was terrific to watch - I was already a fan of his from the Lost Girl (2010-current) TV show, and it was great to see his big screen performance kept him in a similar paranormal format, i.e. he remained &#34;wolfy&#34;!  The movie itself continued with the Gothic-look found in the original trilogy, which kept a nice continuity to it.

1374004,A246YIFE5M6M2C,B003Y5H5EW,"Shawn Kovacich ""Shawn Kovacich""","[9, 15]","Okay, I just got back from the midnight showing of this movie, which by the way is technically the fourth movie in theUnderworldseries and arguably the second best one in the series after of course the first one. This movie takes place 12 years after the second film in the series,Underworld: Evolutionalthough we do see a brief scene that takes place just a few months to maybe a year after the end of the second film.Now I am not one to post spoilers, but I will set the premise of this film up for you, which by the way comes from the first couple of minutes of the movie.Shortly after the end of the second movie, humans find out about the actual existence of both lycans and vampires. So obviously the humans go on a rampage and hunt down and destroy all lycans and vampires, which is eventually referred to as, ""The Purge."" It is during this time period that both Michael and Selene attempt to get out of the area and our instead ambushed and captured by the humans. Flash forward twelve years and this is where the story starts to unfold.Now like I said earlier, I am not going to reveal any real spoilers, but I will throw you a couple of appetizers such as the chief villain in the movie being played by Stephen Rea, whom you might recall from such movies as;Citizen XandMichael Collins. He plays a government sanctioned scientist leading the way in creating a ""cure"" or vaccine to combat against vampirism. You are also introduced to two new characters, one of which can best be described as a unique combination of lycan andThe Incredible Hulkfrom Marvel Comics fame, while the other reminded me of a cross between the scary little girl played in the classic horror movieThe Exorcistand the freaky little ghost girl in the newer horror movie based on the original Japanese version ofThe Ring. Another really cool part of the movie was a couple of unique, although not entirely surprising, plot twists that really grabbed my attention and made the movie all that more entertaining.One thing that really stood out for me in this movie was what a really vicious and totally un-remorseful vampire Selene has become since the first two installments of the Underworld series. She is much meaner and grittier in this movie than the first two, and of course just as beautiful if not even more so than before. If you are a fan at all of good action vampire/werewolf movies, and especially the Underworld series, you will not be disappointed at all by this latest installment. Well, maybe a little because you will be disappointed when it ends although it does leave an opening for another installment in the series, which I am quite sure they are already in various stages of producing it as you read this. At least I hope so!Shawn KovacichAuthor and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.",5,A Very Worthy Installment In the Underworld Series,1327017600,"01 20, 2012",2012,2789,"['Okay', 'just', 'got', 'back', 'midnight', 'showing', 'movie', 'way', 'technically', 'fourth', 'movie', 'theUnderworldseries', 'arguably', 'second', 'best', 'one', 'series', 'course', 'first', 'one', 'movie', 'place', '12', 'years', 'second', 'film', 'series', 'Underworld', 'do', 'see', 'brief', 'scene', 'place', 'just', 'few', 'months', 'maybe', 'year', 'end', 'second', 'film.Now', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'post', 'spoilers', 'will', 'set', 'premise', 'film', 'up', 'way', 'first', 'couple', 'minutes', 'movie.Shortly', 'end', 'second', 'movie', 'humans', 'find', 'out', 'actual', 'existence', 'lycans', 'vampires', 'So', 'obviously', 'humans', 'go', 'rampage', 'hunt', 'down', 'destroy', 'lycans', 'vampires', 'eventually', 'referred', 'Purge', 'time', 'period', 'Michael', 'Selene', 'attempt', 'get', 'area', 'instead', 'ambushed', 'captured', 'humans', 'Flash', 'forward', 'twelve', 'years', 'where', 'story', 'unfold.Now', 'said', 'earlier', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'reveal', 'real', 'spoilers', 'will', 'throw', 'couple', 'appetizers', 'such', 'chief', 'villain', 'movie', 'being', 'played', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'whom', 'might', 'recall', 'such', 'movies', 'Citizen', 'XandMichael', 'Collins', 'government', 'sanctioned', 'scientist', 'leading', 'way', 'creating', 'cure', 'vaccine', 'combat', 'vampirism', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'two', 'new', 'characters', 'one', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'unique', 'combination', 'lycan', 'andThe', 'Incredible', 'Hulkfrom', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'fame', 'other', 'reminded', 'cross', 'scary', 'little', 'girl', 'played', 'classic', 'horror', 'movieThe', 'Exorcistand', 'freaky', 'little', 'ghost', 'girl', 'newer', 'horror', 'movie', 'based', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'Ring', 'really', 'cool', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'couple', 'unique', 'not', 'entirely', 'surprising', 'plot', 'twists', 'really', 'grabbed', 'attention', 'made', 'movie', 'more', 'entertaining.One', 'thing', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'movie', 'was', 'what', 'really', 'vicious', 'totally', 'un-remorseful', 'vampire', 'Selene', 'become', 'first', 'two', 'installments', 'Underworld', 'series', 'much', 'meaner', 'grittier', 'movie', 'first', 'two', 'course', 'just', 'as', 'beautiful', 'not', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'before', 'are', 'fan', 'good', 'action', 'vampire/werewolf', 'movies', 'especially', 'Underworld', 'series', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'latest', 'installment', 'Well', 'maybe', 'little', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'when', 'leave', 'opening', 'installment', 'series', 'am', 'quite', 'sure', 'are', 'already', 'various', 'stages', 'producing', 'read', 'least', 'hope', 'so', 'Shawn', 'KovacichAuthor', 'Creator', 'numerous', 'books', 'DVD']",N/A

Well I guess it's a good thing for us though, no? Because without the war there would be no action-packed Underworld series.I'll try to keep this short since my review is a tad bit late to the party: The beginning of Awakening suggests that approximately 12 years ago the humans executed a major Vampire/Werewolf (Lycan) cleansing, but Selene (Kate Beckensale) was captured and frozen cryogenically in an experimental biotech lab. All other Vampires and Lycans have supposedly been exterminated...for the most part. Immortal survivors are in hiding literally underground...or should I say ""Underworld"". An unknown entity frees Selene from her ice-prison, and she creates absolute mayhem for anyone in her way to find out what has happened and where her beloved Vampire/Lycan hybrid Michael is.The effects in the entire series have been great and Awakening only improves on the tradition. The movie is a dark, but visual spectacular. There's suspense, tons of action and a great storyline from the start of the prequel calledRise of the Lycans, tothe original, throughEvolutionand right up to Awakening.All in all a very well done continuation of the story that pays to watch from the beginning. Yes, Awakening stands alone, but this is one movie that I believe was not intended for seeing prior to its predecessors. So if you haven't already, you'll want to view both Underworld and Underworld Evolution and watch them in order.

Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.----------------------------------------Bought this from FYE for 15.99, they were having a special sale on it.  I have been looking forward to seeing this for some time.  Ever since I saw the original 'Underworld' and 'Underworld: Evolution' years ago I have been a fan.Well...this one fell short, hard.  For starters, Scott Speedman did not return as Michael.  There was an extremely brief scene with ""Michael"" but the person was obviously not Speedman.  But this was only the beginning of the confusions for me.**Spoilers Ahead/And a lot of Confusion**For starters...how did we the humans find out about the vampires and lycans?  Why did a silver grenade have an effect on Michael?  Why did an ultraviolet blast stun Selene?  Was Selene pregnant, where did that hybrid child (her daughter) come from?  Why was Selene frozen for 12 years?  Why was she freed by that human, or did her daughter free her?  Speaking of her daughter, why did the lycans create her?  How could that guy become such a HUGE lycan?  I mean he was IMPOSSIBLY huge.  Are there any vampires left besides that one covern?  Where is this franchise going?Whew.  Simply put I was stammered while watching this movie.  Don't get me wrong, it is action packed and has Selene kicking some serious ass.  She is definitely a hard-core chick who can take care of herself.  Unfortunately action and Beckinsale's hot looks are not enough to save this film.Is this franchise dead?  No.  It could still be turned around, but the next film needs to be OUTSTANDING.  It needs story, well developed characters, and the return of Scott Speedman.  Here's an interesting concept for the next film, have the next one set 100 years in the future.  Then we could have a lot of cool sci fi elements in it, i.e. flying cars and laser guns.  Just a thought.Is this worth buying?  Only if you are a die hard fan (like me) of this series.  BUT...buy this one cheap, it's not worth a lot.  It will no doubt go on sale very soon, wait and get it cheaply.

The film clocked in at under 90 minutes and the editing was excessively choppy leaving one with the feeling that a reel or two had been left on the cutting room floor.

Oh think what political themes and Nazi/republican slants could have been realized).  But NOOOO!  Instead, we are presented with a Saturday morning movie with action sans substance.

Picking up a bit after where ""Evolution"" left off we find Selene (thankfully Kate Beckinsale returns) pining away for a lost Michael, vampiredom in disarray and being hunted by the humans, and with the werewolves surprisingly close to helping fulfill their extermination and obtaining victory in their war.  Selene saves the day against some new (and hazardously big) nasties while protecting her kin.  Eve, a new vampire-werewolf hybrid, has to be saved after being experimented upon and Selene is just the one to be able to do so.  Does she save herself in doing so?  Bet you can answer that yourself.Beckinsale looks fantastic in her leather catsuit and hasn't lost a step though the fight choreography in this installment is perhaps the weakest of all four IMO.  Actor Kris Holden-Ried is brought in to confuse anyone who has an affinity for the band Coldplay to wonder why frontman/ lead singer Chris Martin is in this movie (ha ha)!Based on this installment this series can go in a couple of different directions but mayhap the direction they should take it would be to infuse new horror lore by introducing other classic movie monsters into the scheme of things.  How about the werewolves, being all but taken care, leave the rest of the fledgling vampires to find a peaceful co-existence in the human world while Selene and her new family start a P.I. business a la Kolchak the nightstalker?  Or what if, with the werewolves being suppressed, the vampires have to battle it out with a race of gillmen or mummys or Frankenstein-ish monsters (created by the military) or...wait for it...zombies?  I'm just saying...!So there's possibilities but if you felt like I was reaching for some straw to stuff in the scarecrow then maybe you, too, will have a sense of what this movie ultimately feels like by movie's end.

If you give this movie 4 or 5 stars, then how many starts did the 1st one deserve? Does the original film get 5 starts and 2 smiley faces? Or do you give it 5 +++ stars?

I'm also a huge fan of the original series concept. However, as much a I like Kate in tight leather, this movie was horrible and the worst of the lot. The acting and story live left much to be desired. The actor who played Michael Corvin is clearly not in this movie. The shots are far off or manipulated in some way shape or form to hide the fact that Michael (the original one) is not in the film . This series, like the Matrix series, destroyed a great idea.

While the fourth entry of the ""underworld"" franchise is enjoyable enough with decent, if not outstanding, action set-pieces, the film suffers from its underdeveloped storyline. Action scenes are fun to watch (and there are many of them), but the film's pace seems more like rushed than fast-paced, not allowing us to connect to anyone in the film, until the final thirty minutes, in which the story finally decides on where to go.""Underworld: Awakening"" opens with a quick recap of the previous films, followed by an action sequence showing what has happened to Selene and Michael since the last chapter. Now humans know the existence of Vampires and Lycans, and Selene and Michael are captured and imprisoned in a laboratory of a certain institute. Twelve years later, Selene wakes up again and runs away with a young vampire David (Theo James) and a little girl Eve or ""Subject 2"" (India Eisley), but they are relentlessly hunted by the werewolves.Only Kate Beckinsale returns to the series.

I was really hoping all these years that Selene would return and with a child. After being suspended in time for a few years she does. But where's the child? Some spoilers ahead. Aha! Enter the evil scientists'. They captured Selene and Michael, imprisoned them in cryo tanks and took their child to perform experiments on. They have waited impatiently until child reached menses age in order to harvest genetic material.  Over time she has ""felt"" a closeness to Selene so she releases her and Selene proceeds to wreak havoc and create mayhem. Her boy friend disappeared, she thinks he is dead. She doesn't know she has had a child just yet. Selene is REALLY ANGRY and REALLY MEAN. She has much greater powers now. She slays her way to the heart of the problem where she nearly meets her match in a monstrous monster of a Lycan. Evil scientist just happens to be Lycan and he and others are creating uber Lycans immune to silver. The battle rages on. Did I mention that Child is not a ""child"" but a hybrid, daughter of Selene and Michael? Child dislikes head Scientist intensely. She kicks adz as well as her mother, ridding the world of Evil Scientist quite handily. Listen for the double entendre after she does that.  Selene finds Michael while decimating security personnel and Lycans and she shoots a hole in the cryo chamber to set him free while she continues to rid the world of Lycans. The ending finds Selene and Eve(?) and a helpful vampire entering the room where Michael was imprisoned but just ""that much"" too late for he has disappeared yet again. They race to the roof to see a helicopter vanish in the night sky. This role belongs to Kate. Without her there would be no Underworld series. I am glad they are back.
