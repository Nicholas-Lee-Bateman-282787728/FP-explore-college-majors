874880,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0006VL1JM,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[4, 4]","Nominated for three Golden Globes, Good Times premiered in mid-season 1974 to widespread critical acclaim and audience popularity. A spin-off of the Bea Arthur (of Golden Girls fame) sitcom Maude (1972), Good Times became the fourth of five highly successful sitcoms brought into being during the 1970's decade by Norman Lear. In addition to Maude, those sitcoms were All In The Family (1971), Sanford & Son (1972), and The Jeffersons (1975). The second of three to focus exclusively on African-American family life, Good Times became a source for groundbreaking social commentary in compliment to its penchant for hilarious family comedy...Good Times centers around the lives of James (John Amos) and Florida Evans (Esther Rolle), an African-American couple raising their three children in a Chicago housing development. Eldest son J.J. (Jimmie Walker) is a skinny, wisecracking ladies man with an affinity for painting. Middle child Thelma (BernNadette Stanis) plays the role of moderating influence on the passions of her two brothers, while youngest son Michael (Ralph Carter) is always involved in a cause to help others or end an injustice. The family is often visited by Florida's best friend from high school, Willona (Ja'net DuBois), who also lives in the project. In later seasons, she's accompanied by adopted daughter Penny (Janet Jackson). With additional comic relief provided by overweight super Nathan Bookman (Johnny Brown), Good Times is a family-oriented TV series laden with great one-liners and plenty of laugh-tracks...The Good Times (Season 4) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the two-part season premiere ""The Big Move"" in which the entire Evans family is prepared to move to Mississippi where James has landed a high-paying job. Together with Willona, they plan an elaborate going away party. But the party is interrupted by the news of James' death in a tragic car accident. As the funeral proceeds, the grief stricken children wonder why Florida has yet cry... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""Michael's Great Romance"" in which Michael falls in love with a girl who has the hots for J.J., and ""Florida's Night Out"" in which the family is worried about Florida spending so much time alone, that is until Willona takes her out on the town for a night at an exciting night club...Below is a list of episodes included on the Good Times (Season 4) DVD:Episode 62 (The Big Move: Part 1)Episode 63 (The Big Move: Part 2)Episode 64 (J.J. and the Older Woman)Episode 65 (Michael and the Warlord)Episode 66 (Michael's Great Romance)Episode 67 (Evans Versus Davis)Episode 68 (J.J.'s New Career: Part 1)Episode 69 (J.J.'s New Career: Part 2)Episode 70 (Grandpa's Visit)Episode 71 (Rich is Better Than Poor...

874881,A103KNDW8GN92L,B0006VL1JM,David Hugaert,"[0, 0]","Season Four of ""Good Times"" begins with hope & promise for the Evanses, as James has landed a job in Mississippi in the episode ""The Big Move"". Part One of this episode finds that good things do come to those who wait, as the family prepares for the big move down south. James has finally secured a major opportunity in securing a position as co-owner of a service station. This is a golden opportunity for the Evanses - as they would finally be getting out of the ghetto once & for all. Just as things were beginning to look up, the family learns @ the goodbye party in Chicago that James had been killed en route in an automobile accident. Part Two finds the Evanses attempting to cope with their horrific loss, as the rest of the family can't understand why Florida isn't feeling sorrowful over James' death. This is the popular ""Damn, Damn, Damn!"" episode - the highlight of Season Four. From here, things go downhill, for James only appears from this moment forward in name only. Michael joins a street gang in the episode ""Michael The Warlord"", where Florida mentions that ""there ain't no way James would allow Michael to join that gang"". From this point forward, I've often wondered how James would've handled these tedious situations each of the children were involved in. The Evans clan continues to find ways to get out of the projects, such is the case in the two-part episode ""J.J.'s New Career"" - where J.J. just happens to meet up with two old high school buddies, who offer J.J. what appears to be a lucrative business venture. When J.J. showers the family with expensive gifts, everyone gets suspicious. J.J. later finds out his partners are dealing in gambling & drugs, & escapes a near-tragedy. J.J. discovers a nightclub singer billed as ""The Great White Hope"" in the episode ""The Judy Cohen Story"". This episode is the low point of Season Four. It's on to one of the few high points of this season in the episode ""The Comedian & The Loan Sharks"" - with J.J. managing a young hopeful comedian. J.J. borrows money from a couple of intimidating loan sharks to finance this venture, only to find J.J. in hot water when his young upstart bails on him. Relationships play a pivotal part of Season Four in the episodes ""Florida's Night Out"" & ""Thelma's African Romance"" (a two-parter). In the former episode, J.J., Michael & Thelma find that Florida is feeling lonely since James' death, so they suggest a night on the town, where Florida & Willona (Ja'net DuBois) go to a singles bar. The latter episode finds Thelma dating & getting serious with an African exchange student, who asks Thelma for her hand in marriage. Moses Gunn joins the cast as a supporting player as Florida's love interest Carl Dixon. We first see Carl in the episode ""A Stormy Relationship"" - where Florida & Carl clash over Carl's relationship with Michael over religion. ""Love Has A Spot On Its Lung"" (another two-part episode) finds Carl faced with bad news - he has cancer, which puts a strain on his relationship with both J.J. & Florida. Even though there are more downs than ups in ""Good Times - The Complete Fourth Season"", it is still a season worthy of viewing & purchasing for your must-have DVD collection.

Season 4 began a new phase for the show--the post James Evans episodes.  What I found interesting about the shows writing is that James Evans was the love of Florida Evans life and by seasons end she had found romance with a new man Carl.  On top of that, he was an atheist and Florida was highly religious.  Remember in the early episodes she would speak to the Jesus picture on the wall.  It was hard for viewers to accept that this religious woman who loved her late husband so much would find love with a man so different so soon.  Despite the fact that James was gone from the show there were some suprisngly good episodes.Season 4 was before Penny and Thelma's man Keith.  Rosalind Cash and JJ explore a relationship.  She is older and Florida doesn't approve.  Shirley Hempill (What's Happening) appears in a season 4 episode as the older sister of a woman that Thelma is tutoring.  After the Evans come into some money the two women plan to rob the Evans.  This was a good episode.  Season 4 also includes the two part episode in which Thelma falls in love with African student Ibe (pronounced Ebay). The title screens are slightly different than the previous releases.  There are still no extras like cast interviews or special featurettes.  Hopefully, by the release of the next two seasons there will be a few bonus features.  Since both Esther Rolle (Florida Evans) and Moses Gunn (Carl Dixon) have both passed away it would have been nice to have a little feature about those two.

With John Amos, who played the role of James Evans better than any actor could have, the first 3 seasons are really good. At the same time, season 4 is also pretty good after Amos left because of the new direction the show took with more serious storylines. Esther Rolle really steps up to the challenge of playing the single mother, and even J.J. becomes a little more serious character in his role of becoming man of the house. The majority of these episodes are compelling entertainment and highlight the issues of a mother raising a family alone, having to to be the reasonable one and the tough one that Amos was in the relationship. I know Rolle felt some of these scripts stereotyped inner city black youth, but I think some of the shows in season 4 brought some things home to viewers who really lived the life that the Evans lived.

Sadly it's true in sitcoms even successful sitcoms like Good Times about the Evans family living in the Chicago projects. The show did a fantastic job in the first two episodes regarding James Evans Sr.'s death and Esther Rolle should have garnered an Emmy Award for her performance especially at the end of the second episode. The loss of John Amos was felt on the cast and crew itself. The show was never again the same as it was with both parents. For some stupid, pathetic reason, the network wanted a single parent household much like other sitcoms like Julia with Diahann Carroll and What's Happening! with Mabel King. Apart from the absence of James Evans Sr., the show went on and the cast and crew did their best to keep this show afloat for a few more seasons. Had they just kept John Amos, you can only imagine what it might have been for the show's future. THe first episode in this season has the family moving to Mississippi with everybody but Michael enthusiastic about the move because he has discovered girls and love. When Florida reads the telegram about her husband's death, it sent chills down my spine. Esther Rolle fought hard to maintain John Amos on the show. She wanted an African American family to have both father and mother. Was it so much to ask for really by network standards? Couldn't they have left the Evans family alone? I still love the show even though I'm white and come from a working middle class New Jersey family. My parents didn't graduate from high school in their country so they had to come here for better opportunities. Sadly, the Evans family should have remained the same. The changes over the season like Bookman who can be annoying but played fine by Johnny Brown, Helen Martin returns, and most of the cast is here. It's not surprising that Esther ROlle left the show at the end of the season.",4,If it ain't broke!

Francois ""tfrancois""","[6, 6]","Losing James Evans, the patriach of the family, robbed the show of its momentum and its core ideal of showing a complete African-American family struggling to make ends meet together.  And as badly as the writers chose to deal with the departure of John Amos' character, the performance of Esther Rolle in those two first episodes of this season salvage what is left of a bad situation and it hits home.  The end of the 2nd episode is probably one of the most emotional moments ever in television history and you just can't help feeling her pain and agony over the death of her husband.  It's a credit to Esther Rolle's acting talent and it does the show justice and puts a fitting, albeit bittersweet closure to this unfortunate circumstance.  There are some good shows this season to enjoy however it's clear that the show begins its steady decline from its heyday that it enjoyed the first 3 seasons.  But no matter what you think, Good Times is one of those shows that I believe will forever be considered the best of what television had to offer during the late 70s and is a classic for all time.

It could go head to head with the Cosby Show on issues that effect raising the family, and is like a Raisin in the Sun with a television adaption by Esther Rolle. Great cast. Great writers. It is very sad to see by Season 4 the egos clash between the writers and actors or whatever brought about the end. But Seasons 1-3 with John Amos (James Evans) helped to bring about a family chemistry with the perfected script writing tackling taboo topics much like 'All in the Family'. You see the stresses of invisible and sometime blatant racism. And J.J. finds his niche in art. The majority of the tenants living in the projects are seen from a different light of conservatism and not the hip hop culture of dis-respect, violence, and drugs. Most would like to see these problems resolved but fail to act rightly to do so. At least, you can feel that the black family unit is as conservative then as it was in the 1980s. The stereotypes of Afro-Americans are laid to rest, and the painful reality of racism and struggle are undeniable on 'Good Times'. Seasons 1-3 are ***** stars to me.
