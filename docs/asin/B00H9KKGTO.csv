It starts with an advertisement for Stratton Oakmont (how did they pick that name?). Next a man boasts of his material wealth and possessions. He is a heavy drug user. Where does his wealth come from ? He started working at 22. They call people to get them to &#8220;invest&#8221; (buying pieces of paper with real money). [Is that behavior believable? Fleecing the lambs? Will you learn from this?] Who will you invest with? [Will you read about this in your local newspaper?] The Stock Market crash of October 1987 was the worst since 1929. Jordan Belfort looks for a new job - in Long Island. They sell &#8220;penny stocks&#8221;, an unregulated business, where the broker or salesman makes a 50% commission! [Have you ever received a telephone call from somebody like this?] Jordan&#8217;s sales pitch impresses the others. [What kind of character do they have?] Jordan recruits a neighbor, who explains his personal life. Does he have the right stuff?Jordan starts his own business to sell stocks to the middle class. The poor don&#8217;t have money, the rich are smart enough to turn him down. He recruits friends and operates out of a two-bay garage at first. He will now target the wealthy. First the blue chips, then the penny stocks. They show examples of selling over the telephone. [&#8220;Beware of friendly strangers who want to sell you something&#8221; is still true.] Does this group act like a bunch of lunatics? Guilty consciences? &#8216;Forbes&#8217; magazine interviews Jordan and does a &#8220;hatchet job&#8221; on his firm. [How many people read &#8216;Forbes&#8217; magazine?] This brings in more salesmen! Can you believe all this? Jordan hires his father (for Security). Can you believe their office parties? Drugs and drinking? Jordan is attracted to a new woman (she designs lingerie too). They have similar interests. His wife finds out. &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; Their butler brings his friends over. Who stole his money? The SEC checks their records. Their firm creates IPOs to swindle more money. Was it legal? No, but who was checking their records? Jordan marries Noami in the Bahamas. She gets a yacht. Next a huge estate on Long Island. [&#8220;The Great Gatsby&#8221;?] Then there are arguments in the morning.A man cleans fish bowls and attracts attention. Who owns &#8220;Steve Madden&#8221;, the shoe designer? [What did they produce in this country?] Stratton Oakmont will call people to talk them into buying pieces of paper, stock certificates. &#8220;Start dialing!&#8221; The FBI is interested in his firm. Jordan tells what Wall Street is doing with &#8220;collateralized debt obligations&#8221; and Internet stock. [Remember?] He mentions Goldman [Sachs], Lehman [Brothers] and Merrill Lynch. [All went bankrupt years later because of their mismanagement.] Watch Jordan try to sell this FBI agent! It doesn&#8217;t work. Jordan travels to Switzerland with a bag of cash. A drug problem? We learn about the banking laws of Switzerland. Jordan needs someone to front for him. How can they safeguard their cash? [Where there&#8217;s a will there&#8217;s a way.] An argument draws the attention of the police. Jordan and Doug do quaaludes; these have a delayed effect! Who has a drug reaction? [Call 911.] Who drove Jordan&#8217;s car?Can he make a deal with the SEC? He leaves the firm, &#8220;the land of opportunity&#8221;. Jordan is barred from the securities business (after five years). But he won&#8217;t go. The Feds send subpoenas then interrogate. &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember.&#8221; Aunt Emma died! What about her money? There is a storm at sea! [Has his luck changed?] There is a long list of charges against Jordan and the others. Jordan is offered a deal if he cooperates. Naomi will divorce him and take the children. He overreacts. Jordan will cooperate with the Feds. The FBI raid their headquarters. Many are convicted. Jordan got three years in Nevada. &#8220;Sell me this pen.&#8221; [How would you do it?]This is a sleazy and shocking movie, and not just for the language. You will see scenes that won&#8217;t be shown on broadcast TV. Was it a deserved flop? Aside from the scenes and language, it also runs on too long for its message. I feel sorry for all those taken in by these swindlers, but they should not have trusted a voice on the telephone. Has our society conditioned people to trust all advertising?

1686582,A3KA2MOVBHFWVR,B00H9KKGTO,Adam,"[2, 9]","It's easy to be shocked by ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" In fact, that's almost of the point of the film.One scene best illustrates the excesses of the film: Leonard DiCaprio, as the titular fraudulent Wolf, Jordon Belfort, is on his yacht, surrounded by a lobster lunch, several prostitutes and his next dose of cocaine,when he receives a call from his more clean-cut friend and business partner, warning him that a prominent client is selling his shares. It appears to be a contrast between the indulgent Belfort and a straight-laced foil until an instant later, Belfort's partner snorts a line of coke off his company desk ... and then runs back to snort a second one.This latest film from Martin Scorsese tells the tale of Jordon Belfort, a real-life New York stockbroker who rose to--and fell from--the excesses of riches, fame, sex and drugs. The shock and awe it stirs in audiences isn't necessarily to moralize and decry, but it isn't to praise either, which separates the film from most modern blockbusters.Belfort's illegal dealings take him from a penny-stock postition to his own firm, which eventually earns him almost a million a week. He constantly spends money on his addictive lifestyle, whether he has it or not.Throughout the film, the benefits of cheating and lying are tempered by the detriments. Both of Belfort's marriages sour. He's left scrambling to cover up his illegal activities in the wake, eventually getting more or less what he deserves for the activities his own father rightly and frequently labels ""obscene.""toastyWhat's really obscene is how often this actor toasts people.A three-hour run time doesn't hurt the pacing, and the strong performances--notably from DiCaprio and Jonah Hill, as his right-hand man--ensure that the film is gripping. The excesses of the story are embodied well by the stylized film, especially by the catchy and eclectic soundtrack during a huge storm at sea.The film even sucks the audience in on a meta level, as Belfort's machinations jump from a narration to a fourth-wall-breaking dialogue at the camera to a scene where his private thoughts are heard. The ""rise and fall"" story is common: everyone knows what's coming as Belfort brags, but that knowledge only builds the suspense.I've seen too many films praising crude behavior (read: anything based on a Mark Millar comic book) and too many films moralizing against it (read: the entire Christian film industry). It's disarming to see one that manages to do neither.The movie portrays Belfort's accomplishments as impressive, which they undoubtedly are. But it neither judges nor praises the man's obvious flaws, an accomplishment that is undoubtedly the film's most impressive.There are two main ways to leave the theater--with the blood racing through your veins, high on the adrenaline rush Scorcese so graphically put you through. Or depressed and disgusted with the pure greed and massive debauchery fest; a rat race of gain by greedy, callous rascals who already have more than everything. The film is crafted to be compelling: the audience is not just left to make up their minds themselves; they are forced to.Those of you who shy away from three hours of drug-and-sex fueled debacle should of course avoid this film. To the few dozen of you left, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" can give you perhaps the most interesting perspective on an entertaining biography: a perspective with no moral agenda.",5,A gripping film that makes gives the audience as many excesses as the Wolf himself,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,3420,"['easy', 'be', 'shocked', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'fact', 'almost', 'point', 'film.One', 'scene', 'best', 'excesses', 'film', 'Leonard', 'DiCaprio', 'titular', 'fraudulent', 'Wolf', 'Jordon', 'Belfort', 'yacht', 'surrounded', 'lobster', 'lunch', 'several', 'prostitutes', 'next', 'dose', 'cocaine', 'when', 'call', 'more', 'clean-cut', 'friend', 'business', 'partner', 'warning', 'prominent', 'client', 'selling', 'shares', 'be', 'contrast', 'indulgent', 'Belfort', 'straight-laced', 'foil', 'instant', 'later', 'Belfort', 'partner', 'line', 'coke', 'company', 'desk', 'then', 'back', 'snort', 'second', 'one.This', 'latest', 'film', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'tale', 'Jordon', 'Belfort', 'real-life', 'New', 'York', 'stockbroker', 'who', 'rose', 'fell', 'excesses', 'riches', 'fame', 'sex', 'drugs', 'shock', 'awe', 'audiences', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'moralize', 'decry', ""n't"", 'praise', 'either', 'film', 'most', 'modern', 'blockbusters.Belfort', 'illegal', 'dealings', 'take', 'penny-stock', 'postition', 'own', 'firm', 'eventually', 'almost', 'million', 'week', 'constantly', 'money', 'addictive', 'lifestyle', 'film', 'benefits', 'cheating', 'lying', 'are', 'tempered', 'detriments', 'Belfort', 'marriages', 'sour', 'left', 'scrambling', 'cover', 'up', 'illegal', 'activities', 'wake', 'eventually', 'getting', 'more', 'less', 'what', 'activities', 'own', 'father', 'rightly', 'frequently', 'obscene', 'toastyWhat', 'really', 'obscene', 'how', 'often', 'actor', 'people.A', 'three-hour', 'run', 'time', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'pacing', 'strong', 'performances', 'notably', 'DiCaprio', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'right-hand', 'man', 'ensure', 'film', 'gripping', 'excesses', 'story', 'are', 'embodied', 'well', 'stylized', 'film', 'especially', 'catchy', 'eclectic', 'soundtrack', 'huge', 'storm', 'sea.The', 'film', 'even', 'audience', 'meta', 'level', 'Belfort', 'machinations', 'jump', 'narration', 'fourth-wall-breaking', 'dialogue', 'camera', 'scene', 'where', 'private', 'thoughts', 'are', 'heard', 'rise', 'fall', 'story', 'common', 'everyone', 'what', 'coming', 'Belfort', 'brags', 'only', 'suspense.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'praising', 'crude', 'behavior', 'read', 'anything', 'based', 'Mark', 'Millar', 'comic', 'book', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'moralizing', 'read', 'entire', 'Christian', 'film', 'industry', 'disarming', 'see', 'one', 'do', 'neither.The', 'movie', 'Belfort', 'accomplishments', 'impressive', 'undoubtedly', 'are', 'judges', 'man', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'accomplishment', 'undoubtedly', 'film', 'most', 'impressive.There', 'are', 'two', 'main', 'ways', 'leave', 'theater', 'blood', 'racing', 'veins', 'high', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'Scorcese', 'so', 'graphically', 'put', 'depressed', 'disgusted', 'pure', 'greed', 'massive', 'debauchery', 'fest', 'rat', 'race', 'gain', 'greedy', 'callous', 'rascals', 'who', 'already', 'have', 'more', 'everything', 'film', 'crafted', 'be', 'compelling', 'audience', 'not', 'just', 'left', 'make', 'up', 'minds', 'are', 'forced', 'who', 'shy', 'away', 'three', 'hours', 'drug-and-sex', 'fueled', 'debacle', 'should', 'course', 'avoid', 'film', 'few', 'dozen', 'left', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'can', 'give', 'perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'entertaining', 'biography', 'perspective', 'moral', 'agenda']",N/A

From the quick-fire clips it seemed like this would be a funnymovie with plenty of serious sides with a good-natured sprinkling ofsex appeal (i.e women in skimpy lingerie or even perhaps topless).Within the first fifteen to thirty minutes of watching it, I came torealize just how incredibly wrong I was. Now, I can appreciateutilizing sex and drugs to make your point in a movie, such as Scorsesedid with Good Fellas and Casino, but what he did with this movie was golight years beyond overboard. I don't think it's any kind of anexaggeration to say that 3/4 of this movie is about absolutely nothingother than doing extremely copious amounts of drugs, acting like abunch of lunatics from an insane asylum, and having sex with anythingthat possessed the right biology. Oh, and of course, let's not forgetthe fact that the male leads are completely disrespectful anddisgusting to every single woman that enters their lives, includingtheir wives. Someone mentioned in an earlier review that this movie wasreminiscent of the ancient Roman orgies, but I honestly think theRomans would have far better decorum than this film. All it seemed todo was showcase the absolute worst kind of sociopaths society has tooffer without them being psychopathic serial killers. They even comeclose to doing that when the lead character decides it's a grand ideato snort a half a ziploc bag full of cocaine, put his four-year-olddaughter in the front seat of his car, and go screaming out of thegarage in reverse before slamming into a brick light post. Let me justsay that thankfully the people who made this film did not depict thelittle girl being injured despite what looks to be an incrediblypainful whiplash. If they had, I would have simply shut the movie offand never watched it again, regardless of how it might have ended.Let me just say this movie has no redeeming qualities to it. The sheervolume of quite graphic full-frontal nudity, sex, and drug use wouldprobably be enough to make even the raunchiest frat boy look at hisbuddy and ask, &#34;Is this all there is with this thing?&#34; The fact thatthis movie received so many accolades, award nominations, and evenwins, makes me truly despise how pathetic of a turn our society hasmade. To glorify this kind of completely insanity, to make heroes outof complete sociopaths and psychopaths, to say that everything they didis just fine because it's entertaining is all the more reason for me tojustifiably feel that the way our society currently operates needs toend.Do not throw your money away to even rent this &#34;film&#34; and become yet another one of Belfort's victims by giving him even more money to spend on exactly what is portrayed in the film (the man is still collecting royalties on both the film and the book, both of which were based on his life).

The fact that it didn't portray Jordan Belfort in a flattering light has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that it's still basically a pretext for three hours of over-the-top swearing, nudity, and drug use. Leonardo di Caprio is a good actor and does as much as he can with the part and the script, but it's basically a two-dimensional character in a two-dimensional script.

1686612,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B00H9KKGTO,Andres C. Salama,"[3, 8]","A biopic directed by Martin Scorsese about the rise and fall of one Jordan Belfort, a Wall Street stock broker who founded in the 1980s a brokerage firm that centered on selling penny stocks using high pressure tactics to small investors. He was indicted for fraud in 1998 and was sentenced for a relatively lenient 22 months in prison. The amoral, drug addicted Belfort is played by Leonardo Di Caprio (this is his fifth film for Scorsese); Jonah Hill is Belfort's main sidekick, Donnie. The Australian actress Margot Robbie is great as the blond bombshell - dumb model - trophy second wife of Belfort. Rob Reiner has an unnecessary extended cameo as Belfort's father. Though the subject matter is certainly interesting and the acting is fine, this film, despite its undeniable brio, is also quite unpleasant with its three hour non stop show of drug use and sordid sex. The movie is very repetitive: we see sex, drug use, a joke involving oral sex, sex, drug use, etc. Moreover, the movie has no characters one can sympathize &#8211; everybody is extremely unpleasant (well, maybe with the exception of the FBI agent played by Kyle Chandler, but he appears in the screen for only a little time). Jean Dujardin (the silent movie star from The Artist) has a nice cameo as a venal, corrupt Swiss banker.",3,"Well acted and with an interesting subject matter, but too long, repetitive and unpleasant",1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,1302,"['biopic', 'directed', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'rise', 'fall', 'one', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'Wall', 'Street', 'stock', 'broker', 'who', 'founded', '1980s', 'brokerage', 'firm', 'centered', 'selling', 'penny', 'stocks', 'using', 'high', 'pressure', 'tactics', 'small', 'investors', 'was', 'indicted', 'fraud', '1998', 'was', 'sentenced', 'relatively', 'lenient', '22', 'months', 'prison', 'amoral', 'drug', 'addicted', 'Belfort', 'played', 'Leonardo', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'fifth', 'film', 'Scorsese', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Belfort', 'main', 'sidekick', 'Donnie', 'Australian', 'actress', 'Margot', 'Robbie', 'great', 'blond', 'bombshell', 'dumb', 'model', 'trophy', 'second', 'wife', 'Belfort', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'unnecessary', 'extended', 'cameo', 'Belfort', 'father', 'subject', 'matter', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'acting', 'fine', 'film', 'undeniable', 'brio', 'also', 'quite', 'unpleasant', 'three', 'hour', 'stop', 'show', 'drug', 'use', 'sordid', 'sex', 'movie', 'very', 'repetitive', 'see', 'sex', 'drug', 'use', 'joke', 'involving', 'oral', 'sex', 'sex', 'drug', 'use', 'etc', 'Moreover', 'movie', 'characters', 'one', 'can', 'sympathize', '8211', 'everybody', 'extremely', 'unpleasant', 'well', 'maybe', 'exception', 'FBI', 'agent', 'played', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'screen', 'only', 'little', 'time', 'Jean', 'Dujardin', 'silent', 'movie', 'star', 'Artist', 'nice', 'cameo', 'venal', 'corrupt', 'Swiss', 'banker']",N/A
1686613,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00H9KKGTO,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","Exploitation is something that happens a lot in movies.  Bodies are exploited.  Heroics are exploited.  The audience is exploited.  We sit back and indulge in reckless behavior from the safety of a theater seat and allow the exploitation to envelop us, knowing that we are free from the harmful effects of said exploitation because &#8216;it&#8217;s only a movie&#8217;.  The question that comes up then is, when is this theatrical exploitation dangerous to the audience?  When is too far, too far?  Where is the line that has to be drawn and when is enough, enough?  Is enough ever enough?  Is there such a thing as &#8216;too far&#8217;?Wouldn&#8217;t &#8216;too far&#8217; constitute a breach in our freedom of speech and our ability to create &#8216;art&#8217;?Personally, I&#8217;ve asked myself this question very few times.  At the end of the day, I don&#8217;t feel that there should be such a thing as &#8216;too far&#8217; because it tears at the very fabric of our societies lust for art.  If we handicap our artists, what are we left with?  In all honesty, sometimes we have to wade through the things we can&#8217;t stand to be able to enjoy the gems we cherish so much.Handicap one, handicap all.But, the conversation of exploitation can be focused on another facet of film.  All too often we think of exploitation in a purely carnal light, and in that sense it can be rampant, but twice this year I&#8217;ve seen films that shine that exploitative light in another direction.  Sure, the carnality of it all is still very prevalent, but it isn&#8217;t the sole focal point, at least not how you&#8217;d expect.  No, I&#8217;m not talking about the exploitative nature of &#8216;Spring Breakers&#8217; bounty of flesh and debauchery, although &#8216;The Wolf of Wall Street&#8217; is pretty much on par with that film as far as flesh and debauchery are concerned (and maybe even more so) but I&#8217;m talking about a deeper, more provocative exploitation; the exploitation of moral deprivation.  I saw this also in the critically acclaimed documentary &#8216;The Act of Killing&#8217;, and I see it here; a film that shines a light on the immoral center of human beings and dares to exploit it, creating within it a sense of glorification that can be off-putting to say the least.While I have voiced my clear concerns for the way that &#8216;The Act of Killing&#8217; presented it&#8217;s points, I have to say that &#8216;The Wolf of Wall Street&#8217; was not nearly as offensive in tone.  This is partly a good thing and also party because of the film&#8217;s own failings, but I&#8217;ll get to that in a minute.First, the hoopla surrounding this film had a lot to do with the fact that Jordan Belfort ruined the lives of MANY people and then, even after being arrested, wound up serving nowhere near the time he was initially supposed to serve and wound up writing a best-selling novel, and a lot of people felt that adapting that novel was giving him unfair publicity and thus lining his pockets with money he wasn&#8217;t entitled too.  I&#8217;m not going to form an opinion on this.  Movies are made about unsavory characters all the time.  We, the public, tend to gravitate towards stories about ordinary people doing terrible things because we feel this connection to it somehow.  There is humanity in imperfection, and we can relate or at least form an assertive opinion, one way or the other.Bottom line is, Jordan Belfort&#8217;s story, no matter how hurtful to those he victimized, is interesting.But then came all the reviews claiming that this film was glorifying Jordan&#8217;s actions and basically exploiting his moral deprivation, making him this horrible person we can root for because his life was just so much fun.  I don&#8217;t see this at all.  Yes, this is shot like a black comedy and it is VERY explicit with all the so-called &#8216;fun&#8217; aspects of Jordan&#8217;s life, but it never glorifies anything.  In fact, the entire film basically makes Jordan Belfort look like a gigantic loser.  While he starts off a young man with ambition and morals, he is corrupted by the men in his profession and by the greed that engulfs those in the position to be greedy and he winds up becoming a loathsome creature.  Yes, he is having a good time, but I never once watching his actions and thought &#8216;I wish that was me&#8217;.  He looked like a buffoon.  He was a rich buffoon (and God in heaven knows I wanted all his money), but his actions were repulsive.The corruption that circled his life was never once shielded from our eyes.And yes, the plight of the victims is avoided entirely here, and I can see the criticism there.  It is in that vein that my main complaint comes (or at least they are associated).There was something missing.While all of the debauchery surely took up a lot of space on the screen (and a lot of film), I&#8217;m not quite sure Martin Scorsese&#8217;s points were clear enough.  This is where I feel that the film&#8217;s failings.  You see, I wasn&#8217;t too keen on the way that &#8216;The Act of Killing&#8217; presented its points and yet, at least I felt like it had points to present.  Here, it doesn&#8217;t feel like there is a solid foundation for Scorsese&#8217;s tale.  As a story of one man&#8217;s worldwide deception, it is an exciting and hilarious romp, but as a moral character study, it is lacking the depth it needed.  It all feels somewhat devoid of a point, and while some will baulk at this and find clear moral center points in aspects of the film (Belfort&#8217;s last speech to his company where he turns his &#8220;goodbye&#8221; into an invigoration is quite telling to the nature of these people and the people that buy into their so-called &#8216;lives&#8217;) but at the end of the day there is an emptiness here that I feel like Scorsese should have been able to fill.Still, the film is a high-octane depiction of the effects of greed and how they can deteriorate an individual and the lives of the people around him, and how money cannot buy you happiness, even if you can afford to throw lobsters at people.The film is also anchored by two brilliant performances.  Both Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill handle the film&#8217;s toxic comedy with such ease that it gives the film an added layer of authenticity.  Despite the bounty of preposterous, the film always feels accessible and realistic because of their fearless performances.  They thrust themselves into every scene and create an air of atmosphere that serves as the tone for the entire film.  In fact, the entire cast is up to the task, and even the small cameo roles from the likes of Matthew McConaughey, Jean Dujardin and Joanna Lumley are remarkable and necessary.  And newcomer Margot Robbie is a STONE-COLD-FOX!Maybe the film should be faulted for being fun, but I can&#8217;t fault it for that since I never felt that the fun made the actions acceptable.  We are never once going to condone Belfort&#8217;s actions.  And while one may say &#8220;you are ok with this but have a problem with &#8216;The Act of Killing&#8217;?&#8221; and to them I say, genres are tricky things and for me, as a documentary, &#8216;The Act of Killing&#8217; had more to live up to, because it is not merely viewed as a medium for entertainment.",4,The cry of the wolf...,1395878400,"03 27, 2014",2014,7300,"['Exploitation', 'something',

It's so over-the-top that you will laugh your pants off at how ridiculous these people are. To sum this movie up in three words: drugs, hookers, and fraud.Watching Leonardo DiCaprio play this real life story onscreen reveals how charismatic, persuasive, and insane Jordan Belfort really was. The level of mob mentality at Stratton Oakmont must have rivaled Jim Jones and the People's Temple right before the Kool-Aid incident. Given the amount of coke, pills, orgies, and out-of-control salespeople onscreen, it's hard to imagine that this was based on a true story. But it is.This movie is just as much a cynical commentary on Wall Street stockbrokers and their lives of excess as it is a sad and often funny look into the downward spiral that accompanies rich druggies. At one point, Jordan swallows 4 to 5 Lemmon 714's, the strongest Quaalude ever created. After 90 minutes of no high, the expired drug triggers its time released properties all at once and unload on him like a dump truck full of bricks. Jordan crawls and rolls out of a country club like a demented cerebral palsy patient in a scene reminiscent of the Ether trip in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. It's moments like this that make The Wolf of Wall Street comic gold.In the end, the inevitable happens. Jordan Belfort is sent to Club Fed for the outrageous pump and dump scheme that was Stratton Oakmont. His trophy wife Naomi packs her bags, takes the kids, and heads for greener pastures. The real Jordan makes a brief cameo during the end of the movie as he introduces Leonardo DiCaprio's character to a packed room of seminar attendees looking to sharpen their sales skills. Overall, The Wolf of Wall Street is one epic portrayal of greed and its consequences.",5,"Very, Very, Funny Black Comedy.",1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,1832,"['Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'caricature', 'movies', 'Wall', 'Street', '1987', 'Boiler', 'Room', '2000', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'will', 'laugh', 'pants', 'off', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'people', 'are', 'sum', 'movie', 'up', 'three', 'words', 'drugs', 'hookers', 'fraud.Watching', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'play', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'onscreen', 'how', 'charismatic', 'persuasive', 'insane', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'really', 'was', 'level', 'mob', 'mentality', 'Stratton', 'Oakmont', 'must', 'have', 'rivaled', 'Jim', 'Jones', 'People', 'Temple', 'right', 'Kool-Aid', 'incident', 'Given', 'amount', 'coke', 'pills', 'orgies', 'out-of-control', 'salespeople', 'onscreen', 'hard', 'imagine', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'is.This', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'cynical', 'commentary', 'Wall', 'Street', 'stockbrokers', 'lives', 'excess', 'sad', 'often', 'funny', 'look', 'downward', 'spiral', 'rich', 'druggies', 'one', 'point', 'Jordan', '4', '5', 'Lemmon', '714', 'strongest', 'Quaalude', 'ever', 'created', '90', 'minutes', 'high', 'expired', 'drug', 'time', 'released', 'properties', 'once', 'unload', 'dump', 'truck', 'full', 'bricks', 'Jordan', 'crawls', 'country', 'club', 'demented', 'cerebral', 'palsy', 'patient', 'scene', 'reminiscent', 'Ether', 'trip', 'Fear', 'Loathing', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'moments', 'make', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'comic', 'gold.In', 'end', 'inevitable', 'happens', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'sent', 'Club', 'Fed', 'outrageous', 'pump', 'dump', 'scheme', 'was', 'Stratton', 'Oakmont', 'trophy', 'wife', 'Naomi', 'bags', 'kids', 'heads', 'greener', 'pastures', 'real', 'Jordan', 'brief', 'cameo', 'end', 'movie', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'character', 'packed', 'room', 'seminar', 'attendees', 'looking', 'sharpen', 'sales', 'skills', 'Overall', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'one', 'epic', 'portrayal', 'greed', 'consequences']",N/A

1686628,AAX387K7441BL,B00H9KKGTO,AvidReader,"[2, 4]","Scorsese clearly believes he can play it both ways with this movie. He wants to make a searing statement about corporate greed while at the same time giving a nudge and wink to the good ol' boys on Wall Street and their excessive, outrageous behaviour. Sorry, Mr Scorsese but you are far too enamoured with this man and his cronies to have the critical distance needed to make a worthwhile film. There's nothing ""satirical"" about this film. In the end it is merely a glorification of greed and excess, portrayed by cardboard characters going through the motions of a tedious, repetitive plot. After the shock value wears off in the first 20 minutes The Wolf of Wall Street is a ""hollow spectacle"" as the WSJ review so aptly stated.What makes it especially offensive is the fact that the world economy was brought to its knees by exactly the kind of reckless behaviour glorified in the film and yet there is barely any mention of Jordan Belfort's victims, many of them small-time investors who trusted him with their life savings (Scorsese said in an interview that he didn't want to take the focus off Belfort, which is a major cop-out that doesn't even make sense. How can you really understand this man's story without knowing how his actions impacted on others?). There is however a scene where Belfort points out how generous he was to a single mother who had nothing when she started working with him, but now holidays in the Bahamas. Is this Scorsese's idea of balance? The fact that he turned on his colleagues to avoid a jail sentence is also underplayed by showing him warning Donnie Azoff not to say anything incriminating while he is wearing a wire.Belfort suffers no serious consequences for his predatory, self-interest and this is emphasised at the end when his is shown playing tennis in his pleasant low-security prison. The straight-shooting FBI agent on the other hand who helps prosecute him is left to take the subway home with all of the ""losers."" The rapt audience hanging off Belfort's every word in the final scene shows that he is now profiting handsomely from his infamy. After blatantly glorifying this despicable man, Scorsese thinks he has the right to pull back at this point and lecture the audience on how manipulative he is to people desperate to make money, but you can't have your cake and eat it too, Mr Scorsese. The huge boost given to Belfort by the film will allow him to go on profiting and swindling people with impunity thanks to your fawning portrayal.The group of motley associates Belfort pulls together when he is starting his own company are straight out of central casting and their idiotic behaviour and celebration of ""getting wasted"" made me feel like I was watching The Hangover. How can you make a serious comment about society with such a bunch of caricatures? Scorsese repeatedly goes for the easy laughs and cheap gags, designed to make the audience feel affection for these characters, despite their debauchery and greed. This is especially true of Donnie Azoff. Don't even get me started on the portrayal of women.In the right hands The Wolf of Wall Street could have been a truly compelling story. As it stands though, based on the memoir of an egomaniac intent on white-washing his own culpability, it's nothing more than a piece of fluff, lacking in any kind of dramatic tension, irony or character development. The fact that it was nominated for an Oscar speaks volumes about the state of the film industry today. It's so heartening to see that there are almost as many one-star ratings for it on Amazon as five-star, showing that people are not as easily won over by this degrading spectacle as the so-called critics who have embraced it.",1,The Wonka of Wall Street,1402617600,"06 13, 2014",2014,3702,"['Scorsese', 'clearly', 'can', 'play', 'ways', 'movie', 'make', 'searing', 'statement', 'corporate', 'greed', 'same', 'time', 'giving', 'nudge', 'wink', 'good', 'ol', 'boys', 'Wall', 'Street', 'excessive', 'outrageous', 'behaviour', 'Sorry', 'Mr', 'Scorsese', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'enamoured', 'man', 'cronies', 'have', 'critical', 'distance', 'needed', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'nothing', 'satirical', 'film', 'end', 'merely', 'glorification', 'greed', 'excess', 'portrayed', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'going', 'motions', 'tedious', 'repetitive', 'plot', 'shock', 'value', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'hollow', 'spectacle', 'WSJ', 'review', 'so', 'aptly', 'stated.What', 'especially', 'offensive', 'fact', 'world', 'economy', 'was', 'brought', 'knees', 'exactly', 'kind', 'reckless', 'behaviour', 'glorified', 'film', 'yet', 'barely', 'mention', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'victims', 'many', 'small-time', 'investors', 'who', 'trusted', 'life', 'savings', 'Scorsese', 'said', 'interview', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'take', 'focus', 'Belfort', 'major', 'cop-out', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'sense', 'How', 'can', 'really', 'understand', 'man', 'story', 'knowing', 'how', 'actions', 'impacted', 'others', 'however', 'scene', 'where', 'Belfort', 'out', 'how', 'generous', 'was', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'had', 'nothing', 'when', 'started', 'working', 'now', 'Bahamas', 'Scorsese', 'idea', 'balance', 'fact', 'turned', 'colleagues', 'avoid', 'jail', 'sentence', 'also', 'underplayed', 'showing', 'warning', 'Donnie', 'Azoff', 'not', 'say', 'anything', 'incriminating', 'wearing', 'wire.Belfort', 'serious', 'consequences', 'predatory', 'self-interest', 'emphasised', 'end', 'when', 'shown', 'playing', 'tennis', 'pleasant', 'low-security', 'prison', 'straight-shooting', 'FBI', 'agent', 'other', 'hand', 'who', 'prosecute', 'left', 'take', 'subway', 'home', 'losers', 'rapt', 'audience', 'hanging', 'off', 'Belfort', 'word', 'final', 'scene', 'shows', 'now', 'profiting', 'handsomely', 'infamy', 'blatantly', 'glorifying', 'despicable', 'man', 'Scorsese', 'thinks', 'right', 'pull', 'back', 'point', 'lecture', 'audience', 'how', 'manipulative', 'people', 'desperate', 'make', 'money', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'cake', 'eat', 'too', 'Mr', 'Scorsese', 'huge', 'boost', 'given', 'Belfort', 'film', 'will', 'allow', 'go', 'profiting', 'swindling', 'people', 'impunity', 'thanks', 'fawning', 'portrayal.The', 'group', 'motley', 'associates', 'Belfort', 'together', 'when', 'starting', 'own', 'company', 'are', 'straight', 'central', 'casting', 'idiotic', 'behaviour', 'celebration', 'getting', 'wasted', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'watching', 'Hangover', 'How', 'can', 'make', 'serious', 'comment', 'society', 'bunch', 'caricatures', 'Scorsese', 'repeatedly', 'easy', 'laughs', 'cheap', 'gags', 'designed', 'make', 'audience', 'feel', 'affection', 'characters', 'debauchery', 'greed', 'especially', 'true', 'Donnie', 'Azoff', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'portrayal', 'women.In', 'right', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'compelling', 'story', 'based', 'memoir', 'egomaniac', 'intent', 'white-washing', 'own', 'culpability', 'nothing', 'more', 'piece', 'fluff', 'lacking', 'kind', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'irony', 'character', 'development', 'fact', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'speaks', 'volumes', 'state', 'film', 'industry', 'today', 'so', 'heartening', 'see', 'are', 'almost', 'many', 'one-star', 'ratings', 'Amazon', 'five-star', 'showing', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'easily', 'won', 'over', 'degrading', 'spectacle', 'so-called', 'critics', 'who', 'have', 'embraced']",N/A

Over the past decade, he has established himself as one of the most iconic actors of our generation and his performance in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" furthers that even more. With a run time of over three hours, it packs a huge punch.The new movie centers on the true story of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), an up-and-coming stockbroker in Wall Street. Befriending Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), he decides to open his own firm, recruiting several of his personal friends. Their firm, Stratton Oakmont, soon becomes a billion-dollar company. Selling stocks that they know will lose their client's money, their corruption and ongoing greed soon catches up to them.With plenty of its graphic moments that aren't fit for the kids, Scorsese holds nothing back, creating an interesting atmosphere and throwing you directly into this world.

His right hand man, Danny Porush (played by Jonah hill, with a slight name change) was probably more despicable then Belfort in real life.

And coke. And anything else they could get their hands on. Curiously, no weed. What this film is is one version of the American insane asylum. It easily could have been called &#34;The Id of New York.&#34; The satisfying of pleasure centers could not be more base without getting more twisted and perverse and probably dangerous, yet our wolf and his ilk have a moral coda and complete justification for their relentless hunt to separate others from their money. These are shlubs finally getting their grubby hands on the American dream, and we are taught in this country that capitalism is a good thing to be aspired to. So they aspire with everything they've got, and they need drugs and sex to not only tolerate the madness of their pursuit, but to fill up its vacuousness, its emptiness. These things are also the spoils of a rich person's depravity. &#34;The Wolf of Wall Street&#34; ranks among DiCaprio's best performances, and he appears to be growing mightily as an actor. He toggles tragically between the sordidness of his own unleashed id and the desire to be a good husband, father and provider. He is a motivator, a rationalizer, a fighter, a failure. He is many things balled up into one drugged-up and -out character, and he pulls it off with magnetic power. I am not sure if this is a good movie or not, but it's riveting and toward the end even funny.

They are greedy, morally reprehensible characters, but this film does not reward them.  In this film, they are the butt of the joke.  A very angry joke.  If you can't see that, and only see the cussing, the drug use, and the sex, then maybe this is not a film for you.  I found it wildly funny, and I for one am happy Mr. Belfort, while not dismissing the film, is unhappy with various ways in which he was depicted (even though he still tries to get publicity from it).  Unlike the system, this film does not let him off the hook.I do think it's fair to say this film should be NC 17 though.  How it got an R, I'll never know.  That being said, any ad or poster for this film clearly states the following: This movie is rated R for ""sequences of strong sexual content, graphic nudity, drug use and language throughout, and for some violence.""

Now, children should not see this movie, I agree, but you might also allow that neither should children (nor anyone, for that matter) be subjected to the harsh fiscal realities worsening every year in America at the hands of the greedy egotists on Wall St. That's the point of satire--to shock and disturb an audience for the purpose of real productive change. So, if you agree with those fairly obvious assertions, kindly step away from the mic when your more refined sensibilities are tortured, as they will be for any moral person seeing the movie. Then again, don't people ritualistically watch passion plays at Easter, and isn't that more awful to ingest. Yet, one might endure it for the feeling of gaining a greater understanding of Christ's divinity.In the media and online, or I guess anywhere that idiots can take over, there will always be the addressing of sensationalism blown through trumpets loud for all to be stupefied and distracted, but I urge true lovers of cinema and satire to spend the shortest three hours you'll sit through all year watching Scorsese's latest high-water mark &#34;Wolf of Wall Street&#34;. Maybe we can embrace this satire as reportage, it is, after all, based on a man's biography, and finally mobilize as a culture to drive out these punk cokeheads from the positions of power they currently enjoy in our economy. &#34;Wolf&#34; is intended to function as that type of catalyst, so get your satire right. When irony, hyperbole and inversion function so prominently in a piece, don't try to access the work as moralistic parable, which it is not. That's about as daft as complaining about Disney cartoons not being dark and violent enough.So, wifey and I give this nasty, overlong film a solid '5' stars.

1686664,A2X17SA4E8V3PU,B00H9KKGTO,Bstrassell0001,"[2, 3]","Next to the real Jordan Belfort&#8217;s memoir of the same name, I wouldn&#8217;t be the least bit surprised if Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Terrence Winter (screenwriter for Scorsese&#8217;s hit television series Boardwalk Empire) turned to Motley Crue&#8217;s The Dirt for inspiration to film The Wolf of Wall Street.Yes, as far as Jordan Belfort&#8217;s lifestyle of decadence and debauchery are concerned, I&#8217;m dead serious: it comes that close. Recently, The Wolf of Wall Street won the title of being the non-commentary film with the record of having the most usage of the F word: next to, among other things, gay and lesbian sex. The list goes on and on. But, at least Scorsese and Winter are being honest. To the best of their knowledge, that is: many sources have confirmed that when Jordan Belfort wrote his two memoirs (The Wolf of Wall Street and Catching the Wolf of Wall Street), he told things from a slanted perspective: giving &#8220;glory&#8221; to himself by calling himself &#8220;The Wolf of Wall Street,&#8221; and simply writing out of bias, a.k.a. not making himself look like such a low-life scumbag. (When many of his fellow and former colleagues know him well enough to reveal that he was much more of a monster than he revealed himself to be.)So, with all of this being said, why have I given four stars to The Wolf of Wall Street?The reasoning is quite complex, to be honest. We all know&#8212;as one of my favorite authors has stated&#8212;that we value, in story, the conflict we avoid in life. Second, we all remember the fun we had watching Oliver Stone&#8217;s two Wall Street films: getting inside looks at Wall Street and her corruption, wrapped around adventures that we saw ensemble casts indulged in. That is, in its own beautiful, original way, the same present given to us by Martin Scorsese with The Wolf of Wall Street.Basing his film off of Jordan Belfort&#8217;s memoir by the same name, and shooting with over 90% accuracy (if you&#8217;ve never read the real Mr. Belfort&#8217;s book, you can find details online of the real and fictionalized events in his film), Scorsese primarily depicts the &#8220;pump and dump&#8221; scam that sent Jordan Belfort to prison, and the series of events that led up to Belfort&#8217;s arrest. We see every step of the scam, all the behind-the-scenes details, and how Jordan Belfort&#8217;s life fell apart in the midst of everything, most notably with his love life. If you are not a stock broker, you probably won&#8217;t understand much of what is going on, but you don&#8217;t have to. That, in my opinion, is what makes the suspense of The Wolf of Wall Street so solid. There&#8217;s plenty of comedy, courtesy of Jonah Hill, who also shows an admirable backbone for serious acting ***at the same exact time***. Combine diverse talents like Hill with diverse talents like Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese (even if Scorsese does not show it very often, he certainly proved it with Hugo), and with The Wolf of Wall Street, you have a unique, admirable piece of artwork, aside from all of the profanity.An important note: I&#8217;ve heard many people say that they felt The Wolf of Wall Street glorified the lifestyle of Jordan Belfort and those who aided him in his fraud and debauchery. When I first entered the movie theater, I got the same impression. Towards the end of the film, however, Martin Scorsese goes full-blown in showing the consequences of the fraud and debauchery. In real life, Jordan Belfort did not get off scot-free&#8230;and he does not get off scot-free in his own film adaptation, either.Not for everyone, but if you enjoyed Oliver Stone&#8217;s Wall Street series and/or are a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Scorsese, and their frequent collaborations, The Wolf of Wall Street is definitely for you.",4,Entertaining and extreme?

If you want to be ethical, become a nun and go join a convent; but just try to keep your grimy fingers out of the tithing plate.And this would be the position of Leonardo DiCaprio in ""The Wolf of Wall Street.""  For the life of me, I cannot understand how this guy hasn't yet won an Academy Award.  Maybe he doesn't have compromising pictures on any of the members?  Who knows?  But it is the case that the Academy likes politically-correct garbage from politically-correct actors for the most part, and Mr. DiCaprio seems to avoid those roles at all costs.  And to him I say, ""Attaboy!  Do you want to work at McDonalds, or do you want to make some real money?""And he surely earned his money here, playing a character that would make Gordon Gekko blush.  Holy smokes.  Excess?  What's more than that?  Excess plus?  And that's what we get here with a character who, with any lesser acting talent, could have made this film go completely off the rails.  Somehow, Mr. DiCaprio makes you believe that a character such as this did really exist, which is a feat in itself.If you don't like films with nudity, this film's not for you.  If you don't like films with foul language, this film's not for you.  And if you don't like films that are really terrific, this film's not for you.  I'm going with a very strong recommendation for non-stop chaos that will make your jaw drop, when that jaw's not laughing hysterically the rest of the time.  And to the Academy?  Give Mr. DiCaprio his due already, won't you?  After all, he's made you lots of money himself so toss him an award already.",5,Now THAT'S What I'm Talkin' 'Bout!,1395792000,"03 26, 2014",2014,2155,"['knew', 'guy', 'once', 'who', 'was', 'stockbroker', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'ethically', 'malleable', 'enough', 'handle', 'So', 'quit', 'gig', 'went', 'sold', 'other', 'garbage', 'probably', 'worth', 'even', 'less', 'stocks', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'garbage', 'either', 'Hey', 'taking', 'other', 'people', 'money', 'what', 'world', 'go', ""'round.Of"", 'course', ""'m"", 'being', 'little', 'facetious', 'truth', 'first', 'paragraph', 'reality', 'how', 'many', 'jobs', 'there', 'exist', 'where', 'employees', 'are', 'completely', 'honest', 'even', 'ethical', 'most', 'time', 'experience', 'almost', 'none', 'want', 'be', 'ethical', 'become', 'nun', 'go', 'join', 'convent', 'just', 'try', 'keep', 'grimy', 'fingers', 'tithing', 'plate.And', 'would', 'be', 'position', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'guy', ""n't"", 'yet', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Maybe', ""n't"", 'have', 'compromising', 'pictures', 'members', 'Who', 'case', 'Academy', 'politically-correct', 'garbage', 'politically-correct', 'actors', 'most', 'part', 'Mr.', 'DiCaprio', 'avoid', 'roles', 'costs', 'say', 'Attaboy', 'Do', 'want', 'work', 'McDonalds', 'do', 'want', 'make', 'real', 'money', 'surely', 'earned', 'money', 'here', 'playing', 'character', 'would', 'make', 'Gordon', 'Gekko', 'blush', 'Holy', 'smokes', 'Excess', 'What', 'more', 'Excess', 'what', 'get', 'here', 'character', 'who', 'lesser', 'acting', 'talent', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'go', 'completely', 'rails', 'Somehow', 'Mr.', 'DiCaprio', 'believe', 'character', 'such', 'did', 'really', 'exist', 'feat', 'itself.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'films', 'nudity', 'film', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'films', 'foul', 'language', 'film', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'films', 'are', 'really', 'terrific', 'film', 'not', ""'m"", 'going', 'very', 'strong', 'recommendation', 'non-stop', 'chaos', 'will', 'make', 'jaw', 'drop', 'when', 'jaw', 'not', 'laughing', 'hysterically', 'rest', 'time', 'Academy', 'Give', 'Mr.', 'DiCaprio', 'due', 'already', 'wo', ""n't"", 'made', 'lots', 'money', 'so', 'award', 'already']",N/A
1686669,AAB0BPNWDIOXJ,B00H9KKGTO,Camazotz,"[7, 8]","I delayed seeing this movie because I'd heard such horrible things about it: that it glamorized the dirtiest sorts of financiers, that these monsters didn't pay for any of their crimes against salt-of-the-earth folks, that it was just one oversized, overzealous and overwrought bacchanal of drugs, hookers and sociopathy for the members of The Unholy Church of Our Lady of the One-Percent. Alas, the other night, I had one beer too many and was in the mood for something kind of greasy, so I threw caution to the wind and rented The Wolf Of Wall Street and, mea culpa, I really enjoyed it.The central focus of the film is the dubious ""rise"" of Jordan Belfort, king of the penny stock, and the merry band of heartless beasts he brings along for his wing-melting ride to the sun. Yeah, there's cussing, there's nudity, there's fraud, there's enough drug use to grate on the last nerve of a dyed-in-the-wool Hunter Thompson acolyte. And for half of the film's ample (perhaps excessive) three-hour running time, that's pretty much what you see. Jordan recruits this cur and that hellion...then he makes this deal and burns that little, old lady out of her pension...all so he might know the pleasure of wrecking a $300,000 sports car while getting road-head and snorting coke-powdered boogers into the depths of his brain.Only insofar as it appears that Belfort (DiCaprio) is having fun could one argue that Scorsese is making his life look sexy. I truly don't envy someone that drinks a bottle full of high-powered quaaludes before flying a helicopter wonkily away from a party filled with his peers: criminals and skanks, most of whom are sleeping in their own vomit. I don't see things like that and think ""...ohh, the GLAMOUR!..."" hence, I had a hell of a time seeing how this movie made Belfort's life of overpriced explosions that left craters behind his every step appealing, although some reviewers panned the movie heartily for just that.The other negative reviews come from those who were more offended at Belfort & Company's collective desire to all but anthropomorphize vice and become its favorite Porta-Potty. There aren't a mere one or two scenes of depravity, oh no. They are virtually beyond counting. Nevertheless, I find it rather bizarre that this is a griping point. It would be kinda like going to see a slasher film and whining afterward about all of the nasty murders and gore. Anyone who has even passing knowledge of social mores on Wall Street knows that s*** like this used to happen all of the time, and probably still does. This movie might be gross, it might be amoral or even immoral...most damning of all, though, I'm certain it's entirely on target. And I bet Scorsese was more concerned with being honest about his subject rather than with being nice to an audience. Wild guess.As the film crosses its halfway point, Belfort still parties like a lunatic and has tons-o-fun, however, it starts taking its toll and his destructiveness draws the attention and the ire of people who would like to see his non-stop orgy, funded by comparative innocents, get shut down permanently. And so begins Belfort's well-deserved and curiously moving (bravo to the acting chops of DiCaprio) fall back to Earth. And what a landing it is.This movie isn't flawless. It's not groundbreaking. But it's pretty damned good and likely very, very true. Hell, Matthew McConaughey's ""Money Chant"" alone is worth the price of admission. If you think your virgin eyes and ears can take it, give The Wolf Of Wall Street a whirl, and watch it all the way to the end.

This is a very black and darkly satiric look  at the horrible people who made tons of money illegally because of their practices on Wall Street. It is similar to the director's scathing look at mob guys in GOODFELLAS.  Both films were biographies of very bad guys, GOODFELLAS of mob guy Henry Hill who went into witness protection and WOLF OF WALL STREET of Jordan Belford whose crimes were all financial instead of murder. Ray Liotta was the lead in GOODFELLAS and Leonardo DiCaprio is the lead in WOLF. It helps to know that the director was a victim of one of these wall street sharks so that has presumably influenced his artistic choices in making this film.Unlike GOODFELLAS, on the awards circuit WOLF is being primarily seen as a comedy and especially DiCaprio's performance. He has already won the Golden Globe for best actor in a comedy for WOLF. Now he is up for the Oscar with it although comedic roles rarely win at the Oscars.Although initially very tough to watch (because I hated every single person), the movie gradually worked its magic on me and by the midpoint I was indeed laughing.  I would have never taken a bet that this movie could make me laugh had I not made it to the mid point. But DiCaprio positively revels in this role and is willing to do whatever is necessary to develop the role to its fullest extent. There is one scene where he is so high on qualludes that he has to crawl to his car from his country club's lobby.  That crawl to the car is just genius. Also, his attempt to get to a Swiss bank using his own yacht on the high seas during a major storm becomes utter bedlam.Basically, what it gets down to, is whether you are a Martin Scorsese fan or not.

Rather than exploiting the 3-hours to show a gradual evolution from straight-laced over-achiever to maniacal, sex- and drug-obsessed white collar criminal, the film simply jettisons the character from the former to the latter, so the audience doesn't get a chance to feel bad for him, or to fondly remember what he used to be, or to think of him as the product of his environment, instead he's just another punk who's gotten rich by stepping on other people.I think the director wants us to like or at least pity this character, but it's hard to when he is so one-dimensional.Also it seemed to also be trying to mix in a mob theme at times but this was inconsistent.

Unlike the others, however, Wolf fails to get a strong story underlying the classic overhead shots and close pans that are Marty's trademarks.  I believe this is the reason that the Academy members objected so vehemently to their private showing of this film: it is drugs and lewd content without so much as a wire coat hanger to hang it upon.  Never is there any tension, never is there a build up to a crescendo.  The faint glimmer of hope for the movie, when the Feds catch on to Jordan, comes at ninety minutes into this bloated fish, and sure enough, the impact is no more than a popcorn fart in a bottle.It lacks the background (e.g Henry Hill as a boy in Goodfellas) on which to hinge a story.  Even Jordan's father (Rob Reiner) is forgettable, not a strong anti-Jordan to Jordan's over-the-top behavior.  Any tension--from Jordan's father, from the Feds earlier in the movie, from his colleagues at the firm--would have added much to the film.  In fact, his only ""pushback"" is from his second wife, and that comes two hours into this fat cow of a movie, and that only lasts two scenes (the last ever screw scene and the kidnapping scene).  How lamentable that this tableau of Jordan Belforte is not more movingly filmed.  Some would argue, it is what it is, it's a true story.  Well, true stories can be told in many ways, and if this was the only option, this film should have been passed on by an experienced director like Martin Scorsese.Acting alone cannot save a movie.  Leonardo is over the top, wonderful here, as he typically is.  However, he is not given a story to show character change, and thus is stunted in his portrayal by a script like a lasso.The behavior here has consequences that are meaningless, and thus, there is no movie.  A stronger story, with more ominous repercussions, told in a more closely edited manner, would have made this movie into a solid ""B"", rather than the ""D"" grade movie that it has turned out to be.  Of course, it is getting mixed reviews online, not only here but elsewhere, and will age poorly in the pantheon of Scorsese movies.  Even the lamentable Casino, because the acting was strong and the story was at least rudimentary, will fare better than Wolf in the years ahead, and that's saying a lot because Casino is awful (watch it again if one has a better recollection of it, and disappointment will reign in-- highly disappointing).Wolf:  A misstep for a great director, and in territory that is his bread-and-butter, the first person narrative of criminals.  Let's all, fans of Marty, pray that he will scribe, along with Pileggi (now 80) one final mob movie, with DeNiro (now 73) and Pesce and Liotta and the rest of the gang, showing aging mobsters still running the show (like Uncle Juni in Sopranos).

Santas ""Constantine/film buff""","[2, 3]","I watched this atrociously powerful movie in two nights, after my wife quit after five minutes, unable to hear the f.. word sprinkled into the dialogue two out of five times. I am used to Scorsese since the times of ""Taxi Driver"" for paranoia, and ""GoodFellas"" for bloody messes and foul language. He most often delivers repulsive characters, bordering on insanity, who climb or attempt to climb the ladder of success, by means foul or fair (mostly foul), leaving in their wake a stream of crimes, and a string of victims in their destructive paths. Almost all of them are climbers, in fantasy or action. They posses a drive that catapults them to ""fame,"" but finally they are done-in by their self-inflicted wounds. Jordan Belfort is one of them, but in terms of performance, Leonardo DiCaprio is ultimately the man who delivers for Scorsese. ""No-holds-barred"" performance--he does everything: cheats, forms a company with drug addicts, has sex worth of ten men (not that his cohorts are far behind), spends illogically, has the quick wit to avoid traps, but not the will or intelligence to quit when he ahead, as Rob Reiner, his dad, tells him. He divorces an average first wife, marries a smashing-looking ex-model, but lets his excesses and misguided self-confidence be the traps through which a clever fed finally throws the nets of justice around him. He ends up with a 36-months sentence, escapes the country, and goes to New Zealand, starting from scratch. No moral to it, says Scorsese in the ""Extras"" (a running commentary would be embarrassing); and let the viewer draw his own conclusion, DiCaprio intones, evidently pleased with his fifth collaboration with the famous director. In the movie he likens himself  to Ahab (in the f.... Moby Dick), mentions ""Greek tragedy,"" when things go badly--while Scorsese mentions that he intended to make ""An American 'Caligula,'"" the notoriously repulsive ""epic"" by Tinto Bras in 1979, in which cruelty and sex and Bob Guccione's Penthouse pets participate. The comparisons end here, however. Scorsese's movie a tough, relentless expose of American greed and ambition with ill-gotten gains, and his work, keeping the analogies, can be compared to the pioneering ""Huck Finn"" of Mark Twain, and the the King and Duke, the immortal con-men that sent the standards for fleecing the nave.

Sawin,"[15, 24]","Jordan goes through a very long winded rundown of how wealthy he is at the start of &#34;The Wolf of Wall Street&#34; that begins as a voiceover and evolves into a breaking-the-4th-wall sequence where the main character of the film talks to the audience; a sequence that Martin Scorsese has become notorious for. It's something that will be revisited over and over again throughout the film that usually results in Jordan cutting himself short and jumping to broader terms because according to the film's writers, &#34;you don't give a f--- anyway.&#8221; As you realize that drugs, alcohol, and sex will take a priority over absolutely everything else in the film, Jordan does finally get to something more worthwhile when he introduces the concept of surviving on Wall Street and how an individual goes about doing that.This is around the time Matthew McConaughey comes in and while he only has a few brief scenes he's still able to leave quite an impression on the audience. McConaughey is engaging, especially in his one lengthened scene with DiCaprio in the restaurant. Their conversation about stock brokers not knowing what they're doing and the importance of masturbating and cocaine in the industry sets the film off on a high note. Jonah Hill is almost androgynous in his role as Donnie. With his wide overbite, massive glasses, terrible fashion sense, and openness of being married to his first cousin, Hill has this Pat from &#34;Saturday Night Live&#34; aura about him. Hill's chemistry with the rest of the cast and his on-screen presence is as engrossing as he was in &#34;Moneyball.&#34;Stratton Oakmont is just a madhouse; a circus full of nothing but drunken tomfoolery, unclean orgies, and forgotten drugs. The Jordan Belfort character is built up as big as humanly possible, so that his fall from grace makes that much more of an impact. Scorsese seems to circle around these films that have protagonists that flourish because of their demons and their flaws while having these skeletons in their closets that they're convinced no one will ever find because they believe themselves to be invincible. These characters attempt to keep their secrets under lock and key at first, but they eventually become more cocky and egotistical until those secrets are discovered and they crash and burn because of them.Jordan Belfort has &#34;Scarface&#34; syndrome in the sense that he basically thinks he's this untouchable God that can get away with anything before finally being busted and never bouncing back. The highlight of the film is the cerebral palsy stage of the Lemmon 714 drug Jordan and Donnie take. Their scuffle afterward is incredible for all of the wrong reasons and is followed by a demonstration of why we have cordless phones today. The film does tend to drag in places and is fairly obnoxious the majority of the time, but actually feels somewhat sincere once Jordan is forced to step away from the company he created.The film follows this very familiar story structure. It's as if Scorsese stripped all of the mafia elements out of &#34;Goodfellas,&#34; threw in some material about Wall Street, altered the script and cast a bit, and added a &#8220;Casino&#8221; amount of vulgarity and called it a day. It's basically broken down like this; a warped character having a dream or desire, that character slowly rising to the top, becoming overconfident while being hunted by the authorities, and then that character spiraling down from a man-made heaven. The only difference is that female characters aren't quite as intolerable in &#34;The Wolf of Wall Street.&#34; In fact, the women are quite mellow for a Scorsese film.&#34;The Wolf of Wall Street&#34; is a testosterone fueled, hallucinogenic fever dream driven by verbose dialogue, sweaty prostitute sex, and snorting cocaine from an unsuspecting rectum. Its plethora of similarities to &#34;Goodfellas&#34; weighs the film down rather than giving it a boost.",2,Feed the geese or implode,1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,3945,"['Jordan', 'very', 'long', 'winded', 'rundown', 'how', 'wealthy', 'start', '34', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', '34', 'voiceover', 'breaking-the-4th-wall', 'sequence', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'talks', 'audience', 'sequence', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'become', 'notorious', 'something', 'will', 'be', 'revisited', 'over', 'again', 'film', 'usually', 'results', 'Jordan', 'cutting', 'short', 'jumping', 'broader', 'terms', 'according', 'film', 'writers', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'f', 'anyway.', '8221', 'realize', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'sex', 'will', 'take', 'priority', 'absolutely', 'everything', 'else', 'film', 'Jordan', 'finally', 'get', 'something', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'when', 'concept', 'surviving', 'Wall', 'Street', 'how', 'individual', 'doing', 'that.This', 'time', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'only', 'few', 'brief', 'still', 'able', 'leave', 'quite', 'impression', 'audience', 'McConaughey', 'engaging', 'especially', 'one', 'lengthened', 'scene', 'DiCaprio', 'restaurant', 'conversation', 'stock', 'brokers', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'importance', 'masturbating', 'cocaine', 'industry', 'film', 'off', 'high', 'note', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'almost', 'androgynous', 'role', 'Donnie', 'wide', 'overbite', 'massive', 'glasses', 'terrible', 'fashion', 'sense', 'openness', 'being', 'married', 'first', 'cousin', 'Hill', 'Pat', '34', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', '34', 'aura', 'Hill', 'chemistry', 'rest', 'cast', 'on-screen', 'presence', 'as', 'engrossing', 'was', '34', 'Moneyball.', '34', 'Stratton', 'Oakmont', 'just', 'madhouse', 'circus', 'full', 'nothing', 'drunken', 'tomfoolery', 'unclean', 'orgies', 'forgotten', 'drugs', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'character', 'built', 'up', 'as', 'big', 'humanly', 'possible', 'fall', 'grace', 'much', 'more', 'impact', 'Scorsese', 'circle', 'films', 'have', 'protagonists', 'flourish', 'demons', 'flaws', 'having', 'skeletons', 'closets', ""'re"", 'convinced', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'find', 'believe', 'be', 'invincible', 'characters', 'attempt', 'keep', 'secrets', 'lock', 'key', 'first', 'eventually', 'become', 'more', 'cocky', 'egotistical', 'secrets', 'are', 'discovered', 'crash', 'burn', 'them.Jordan', 'Belfort', '34', 'Scarface', '34', 'syndrome', 'sense', 'basically', 'untouchable', 'God', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'anything', 'finally', 'being', 'busted', 'never', 'bouncing', 'back', 'highlight', 'film', 'cerebral', 'palsy', 'stage', 'Lemmon', '714', 'drug', 'Jordan', 'Donnie', 'take', 'scuffle', 'afterward', 'incredible', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'followed', 'demonstration', 'why', 'have', 'cordless', 'phones', 'today', 'film', 'tend', 'drag', 'places', 'fairly', 'obnoxious', 'majority', 'time', 'actually', 'feels', 'somewhat', 'sincere', 'once', 'Jordan', 'forced', 'step', 'away', 'company', 'film', 'very', 'familiar', 'story', 'structure', 'Scorsese', 'stripped', 'mafia', '34', 'Goodfellas', '34', 'threw', 'material', 'Wall', 'Street', 'altered', 'script', 'cast', 'bit', 'added', '8220', 'Casino', '8221', 'amount', 'vulgarity', 'called', 'day', 'basically', 'broken', 'down', 'warped', 'character', 'having', 'dream', 'desire', 'character', 'slowly', 'rising', 'top', 'becoming', 'overconfident', 'being', 'hunted', 'authorities', 'then', 'character', 'spiraling', 'down', 'man-made', 'heaven', 'only', 'difference', 'female', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'intolerable', '34', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street.', '34', 'fact', 'women', 'are', 'quite', 'mellow', 'Scorsese', 'film.', '34', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', '34', 'testosterone', 'fueled', 'hallucinogenic', 'fever', 'dream', 'driven', 'verbose', 'dialogue', 'sweaty', 'prostitute', 'sex', 'snorting', 'cocaine', 'unsuspecting', 'rectum', 'plethora', 'similarities', '34', 'Goodfellas', '34', 'film', 'down', 'rather', 'giving', 'boost']",N/A

Their latest venture is the true, astonishing tale of Wall Street crook Jordan Belfort whose appetites for money, sex and drugs are a detailed observation on greed and temptation.An eager, young executive, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), experiences the Wall Street disaster of 1987 which wipes out investors and costs him a job.  Anxious to bounce back, he discovers the art of selling unregulated penny stocks and starts his own brokerage.  Soon he is making a lot of money often at the expense of low income earners but also wealthy clients, and with the help of some cronies including new follower, Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), begins to expand exponentially into a major force in the financial world.  The emotional stress and pressure heighten his need for women, sex, drugs and then drugs upon drugs.  As his excessive lifestyle spirals out of control, the FBI and Securities and Exchange Commission begin investigating his company&#8217;s illegal activities that signals the beginning of the end.DiCaprio (Inception) gives his all as the out-of-control executive whose wealth is surpassed only by his defiance and greed.  It is interesting to contrast his younger, innocent broker with his later, drug addicted shark.  With maniacal fervor, he inspires and rallies a company&#8217;s corporate culture.  You are mesmerized by his bold, flamboyant salesman and yet, you look for any semblance of redeeming qualities.  In a sense, Jordan is a metaphor for our corporate society&#8217;s love of money and its ultimate corruption.Hill (Moneyball) really shows a good range as Belfort&#8217;s second in command.  Can this be the same Jonah Hill who had a supporting role in Knocked Up?  Matthew McConaughey has a memorable supporting role as a mentor to Belfort, and their scene together at a rooftop restaurant where McConaughey shows a ritual of self motivation is a hoot.Margot Robbie is well cast as the beautiful woman who captures Jordan&#8217;s heart and more.  Rob Reiner has an amusing supporting role as Jordan&#8217;s dad who sees the company as a sinking ship.  In fact two other directors, Jon Favreau and Spike Jonze, have bit parts or cameos.  Playing an FBI agent, Kyle Chandler, who has become the go-to actor for government types, is a good foil in his scenes with Jordan aboard a yacht.There are some memorable vignettes such as the outrageous attempts to smuggle millions in cash to Europe, the crazy office parties, and an especially hilariously pathetic attempt by Jordan to drive home at the same moment he has a very bad drug reaction.  When the justice system corners him, Jordan faces a decision not unlike the protagonist in Prince of the City. You know how this is going to go down, and when it does, it is an astonishing reversal of fortune.At three hours, it is constantly engaging and well paced from start to finish courtesy of veteran editor Thelma Schoonmaker.  The sweeping camera shots and rapid cuts show Scorsese at the top of his craft.  He tells much of the film through DiCaprio as narrator and voiceover.  In fact much of this film will remind you of the style and structure of his Good Fellas and Casino, and the ending recalls another Scorsese classic, The King of Comedy.Make no mistake, despite excellent performances and a strong narrative, this film has scenes that are bordering on NC17; some scenes are so over the top in suggestiveness and explicitness that it would be hard to believe if it wasn&#8217;t true.  The film&#8217;s depictions may lead some to question the filmmakers&#8217; intent, but Scorsese, without passing judgment, wanted to honestly show greed and power at its worst in the boardroom and the bedroom.  Consider The Wolf of Wall Street as a supremely effective, cautionary tale of abuse of wealth at a time when such behavior flourished unchecked.  You might not like the passengers on this flight, but it is a fascinating ride.",4,The Temptations of THE WOLF OF WALL STREET,1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,4069,"['Director', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', '8217', 'ongoing', 'collaboration', 'actor', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'yielded', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'prestigious', 'films', 'Departed', 'Aviator', 'latest', 'venture', 'true', 'astonishing', 'tale', 'Wall', 'Street', 'crook', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'appetites', 'money', 'sex', 'drugs', 'are', 'detailed', 'observation', 'greed', 'temptation.An', 'eager', 'young', 'executive', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Wall', 'Street', 'disaster', '1987', 'out', 'investors', 'job', 'Anxious', 'bounce', 'back', 'art', 'selling', 'unregulated', 'penny', 'stocks', 'own', 'brokerage', 'making', 'lot', 'money', 'often', 'expense', 'low', 'income', 'earners', 'also', 'wealthy', 'clients', 'help', 'cronies', 'including', 'new', 'follower', 'Donnie', 'Azoff', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'expand', 'exponentially', 'major', 'force', 'financial', 'world', 'emotional', 'stress', 'pressure', 'heighten', 'need', 'women', 'sex', 'drugs', 'then', 'drugs', 'drugs', 'excessive', 'lifestyle', 'spirals', 'control', 'FBI', 'Securities', 'Exchange', 'Commission', 'begin', 'investigating', 'company', '8217', 's', 'illegal', 'activities', 'signals', 'beginning', 'end.DiCaprio', 'Inception', 'out-of-control', 'executive', 'wealth', 'surpassed', 'only', 'defiance', 'greed', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'younger', 'innocent', 'broker', 'later', 'drug', 'addicted', 'shark', 'maniacal', 'fervor', 'company', '8217', 's', 'corporate', 'culture', 'are', 'mesmerized', 'bold', 'flamboyant', 'salesman', 'yet', 'look', 'semblance', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'sense', 'Jordan', 'metaphor', 'corporate', 'society', '8217', 'love', 'money', 'ultimate', 'corruption.Hill', 'Moneyball', 'really', 'good', 'range', 'Belfort', '8217', 's', 'second', 'command', 'Can', 'be', 'same', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'who', 'had', 'supporting', 'role', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'memorable', 'supporting', 'role', 'mentor', 'Belfort', 'scene', 'together', 'rooftop', 'restaurant', 'where', 'McConaughey', 'ritual', 'self', 'motivation', 'hoot.Margot', 'Robbie', 'well', 'cast', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'who', 'Jordan', '8217', 'heart', 'more', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'amusing', 'supporting', 'role', 'Jordan', '8217', 'dad', 'who', 'company', 'sinking', 'ship', 'fact', 'two', 'other', 'directors', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'have', 'bit', 'parts', 'cameos', 'Playing', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'who', 'become', 'go-to', 'actor', 'government', 'types', 'good', 'foil', 'scenes', 'Jordan', 'are', 'memorable', 'vignettes', 'such', 'outrageous', 'attempts', 'smuggle', 'millions', 'cash', 'Europe', 'crazy', 'office', 'parties', 'especially', 'hilariously', 'pathetic', 'attempt', 'Jordan', 'drive', 'home', 'same', 'moment', 'very', 'bad', 'drug', 'reaction', 'When', 'justice', 'system', 'Jordan', 'decision', 'not', 'protagonist', 'Prince', 'City', 'know', 'how', 'going', 'go', 'down', 'when', 'astonishing', 'reversal', 'fortune.At', 'three', 'hours', 'constantly', 'engaging', 'well', 'paced', 'start', 'finish', 'courtesy', 'veteran', 'editor', 'Thelma', 'Schoonmaker', 'sweeping', 'camera', 'shots', 'rapid', 'cuts', 'show', 'Scorsese', 'top', 'craft', 'much', 'film', 'DiCaprio', 'narrator', 'voiceover', 'fact', 'much', 'film', 'will', 'remind', 'style', 'structure', 'Good', 'Fellas', 'Casino', 'ending', 'Scorsese', 'classic', 'King', 'Comedy.Make', 'mistake', 'excellent', 'performances', 'strong', 'narrative', 'film', 'scenes', 'are', 'bordering', 'NC17', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'top', 'suggestiveness', 'explicitness', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'believe', '8217', 'true', 'film', '8217', 's', 'depictions', 'may', 'lead', 'question', 'filmmakers', '8217', 'intent', 'Scorsese', 'passing', 'judgment', 'wanted', 'honestly', 'show', 'greed', 'power', 'worst', 'boardroom', 'bedroom', 'Consider', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'supremely', 'effective', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'abuse', 'wealth', 'time', 'when', 'such', 'behavior', 'flourished', 'unchecked', 'might', 'not', 'passengers', 'flight', 'fascinating', 'ride']",N/A

Excessive everything: running time (a minute-hand shy of 3 hours); casting (Leonardo DiCaprio giving a career-best performance, Jonah Hill taking a massive pay cut to work with Scorsese); sex, drugs, rock 'n roll, midget tossing.  Everything.It's the story of Jordan Belfort, a Wall Street mogul who rises from practically nothing to practically everything, by means of scams and illicit deals.  He marries, he cheats, he pops pills and snorts drugs.  Endlessly.  Throw in a bunch of one-liners, a magnificent cameo by Matthew McConaughey, and all the guilty pleasures moral people would never dream of indulging in, and you have some of the most disturbing, yet thrilling, three hours of your life.  It all comes complete with the usual Scorsese trappings: an Oscar-worthy lead performance (seriously, DiCaprio goes all-out; it's a performance you don't usually see from an A-lister); terrific supporting roles (Hill, Jon Bernthal, Rob Reiner, Kyle Chandler, Jon Favreau, Shea Whigham, Jean Dujardin, and Margot Robbie, who makes an entrance that left quite a few jaws on the floor...oh, and she's a pretty good actress, too); back-and-forth dialogue from an award-worthy script (from Terence Winter, containing the most f-bombs in Hollywood history); and a story so incredibly disturbing and uncomfortably hilarious, you'll have trouble believing it's true.THE WOLF OF WALL STREET isn't a film for everyone.  Not hardly.  And there's a question of where Scorsese and company's sympathies lie; for sure, Belfort is never portrayed sympathetically.  Yet, as the man himself gets a cameo near the end, it leaves you wondering if Scorsese isn't commenting that, yes, normal people would like a shot at this lifestyle.  I personally disagree with that (money would be good, 'ludes not so much), but there's no doubt that Scorsese is making a valid point.  WOLF is, at its core, a great film; a study in excess, featuring stellar performances, a witty script, and a heart (albeit a little black) that is more or less in the right place...except when it isn't. Think WALL STREET by the way of a Charlie Sheen bachelor party.

Madigan,"[2, 9]","The Wolf Of Wall Streeet runs 180 minutes and one minute of this film is worth more than the thousands of minutes some waste on films that Mark Whalberg turns out, Stallone vomits, or on tame outer space fictions like Gravity, which runs abut 87 minutes and this is way too long.Leonardo Di Caprio's character is shaped by his greed for Wall Street wealth the illegal way. He drinks and does drugs too much and has a lust for women that is disturbing, as his wife demonstrates in her powerful resistance to his indifference to his adultries. He is loud, and so are his alies in this odyssey that moves irrevocably toward a tragic/ comedic stint laced with the death-like face he shows over and over as the film progresses. His overdose scene is sheer brilanc as Scorsese shoews the transformation through De Caprio's face of what is going on inside his mind...very little, as the captalistic system grabs hold of him.The whole film reminded me of Faust, the philosopher who sells his soul to Satan for a life of ease and longevity and shallowness, and dies unwise, imprisoned by his own surrender to mediocrity and infantile ideas about God and death. The film suggests the beginning, middle, and end of a life morally and spiritually dead. The Wolf is dumb, to be sure, but he knows enough about basic survival to fool the so-called intelligent investors who believe in his charm, flattery, lack of wisdom, as we find out in the longevity of his existence as the wolf. He's never really caught, and one of the ways he survives is through language that others are too repressed, too fearful of the discovery that their own self descriptions as humans may summed up in the &#34;F&#34; word used with great purpose here, about 500 times.Scorsese 's understanding of the world we inhabit through the deadly sins others commit, makes him unique and I haven't even touched on the fabulous camera work here, the brilliant editing by Ms. Schoonmaker and the score.When is the last time you sat in front of the TV for three hours or more and came away with only a yawn.  Not here.Scorsese has to make a better statement about life than the dramas TV offers with random shots, bad acting, and endless commercials.See this great film, and if  some people are shocked by the frankness, watch an episode of Days of Our Lives, where priests are sleeping around, one incident all caught on &#34;tape&#34; for a Catholic wedding.

1686737,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00H9KKGTO,Darren,"[0, 2]","[This review is written for those who have seen the movie, so proceed with caution]Say what you want about Jordan Belfort, he managed to sell Martin Scorsese on making a 3-hour epic of his Wall Street &#34;career&#34;.  The kid's clearly still got it.  I put &#34;career&#34; in scare-quotes because it's hard to call it that, since all he seems to do in terms of actual work is &#34;pump up&#34; the sales associates of his penny-stock firm with he-man chest-thumping speeches screamed through a microphone.  (The internets inform me that he now earns his living as a motivational speaker -- no surprise there.)  One wonders how any work got done at Stratton Oakmont between the midget-tossing, the parades of strippers, the Quaaludes, the blow, the designer martinis, the nasally trophy wives, the yachts, helicopters, and sushi lunches, but presumably some work did get done.  It would have been nice to see some of it.  Even in boiler rooms someone's gotta make the coffee.  We are introduced to a group of DiCaprio's initial partners, but aside from Jonah Hill, Scorsese loses interest in them.  Eventually we find ourselves back in familiar Scorsesian territory -- &#34;Goodfellas&#34; and &#34;Casino&#34; territory, in fact.  There's the violent break-up with the screaming wife.  There's the king-of-the-world excess (if Leo will pardon such a titanic pun) followed by destruction brought on by hubris.  There's the ratting-out of amigos, followed by lonely and pathetic exile.  We've been here with Scorsese before, and it's getting a little tiresome.  &#34;The Departed&#34; was fresh and exciting; &#34;The Wolf of Wall Street&#34; is an old man coasting, I fear.But even so, it's still a good time.  Scorsese, even if he's plagiarizing himself, at least spares us some sob-story sidebar about one of the innocent fish defrauded by Belfort's pump-and-dumps.  A more conventional director would do this, so that we could &#34;see&#34; all the damage that a scumbag like Belfort causes people in the Real World.  There was a movie released about 15 years ago called &#34;Boiler Room&#34;, loosely based on Belfort's operation, that did just that.  Thankfully, Scorsese thinks we're smarter than that and therefore don't require all the moral edification.  Even better, we're spared detailed explanations of what exactly DiCaprio's doing that constitutes criminal fraud.  We get an in-depth history of Quaaludes, but learn hardly anything of how boiler-rooms actually operate.  DiCaprio begins one fourth-wall-breaking monologue defining an IPO, but then he stops and says, &#34;You're really not following what I'm saying, are you?  That's all right, it doesn't matter.&#34;  Indeed it doesn't -- why fill up a movie with tedium?  Instead, Scorsese fills up his 3-hour canvas with debauchery on a Caligula-size scale, replete with &#34;No Boinking&#34; signs (with appropriately drawn stick figures with a red line drawn through them) nailed to the office walls, long discussions about midgets and what they're capable of, an endless cavalcade of bouncing bosoms and bottoms, and a kaleidoscope of chemical abuse.  And why?  Because such stuff is more fun to film.  This is entertainment, folks.  If you want to, you can find the edges beyond DiCaprio's wild circle; Scorsese plants a few things out there in the perimeter.  Take note of FBI agent Kyle Chandler's subway ride home, for example.  But Scorsese's not in a lecturing mood; he's like a naughty pixie here, tweaking people's noses.  An outraged review below mine wondered how many times the &#34;F word&#34; was used -- well, I can tell you: 569 times.  (No, I didn't count -- Wikipedia, my friends.)  He goes as far as he can with simulated sex, because he got total control of the picture after Warners dropped it and his name guaranteed an &#34;R&#34;, rather than an &#34;NC-17&#34;, rating, no matter what was in it.  If you got it, flaunt it!  In terms of actual direction, Scorsese has a ball directing DiCaprio and Hill in the grips of a Quaalude overdose that will become a classic clip -- best scene in the movie.  He's clearly delighting in the opportunities that physical comedy affords, and that delight is infectious.  Other than that, he steps out of the way and lets DiCaprio do the work.Scorsese and DiCaprio have worked together five times now.  The actor does for the director what De Niro used to do, and it's finally starting to convince.  DiCaprio will turn 40 this year, and age, with its padding and crows-feet, makes such roles finally plausible for him.  (He was too young when he did &#34;The Aviator&#34;.)  I was convinced throughout that he was CEO of a large company.  It's strange that the movie that depicts almost unending juvenile frat-boy behavior should be the one where Leonardo DiCaprio finally seems grown up.  3 out of 5.",3,Let the good times

1686740,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B00H9KKGTO,David A. Wend,"[6, 13]","The Wolf of Wall Street is a wild ride. The only thing I can compare it to is reading Hunter S Thompson&#8217;s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.  The film is something of a comic version of Oliver Stone&#8217;s Wall Street, and Gordon Gecko is mentioned one by Jordan Belfort. Martin Scorsese&#8217;s film is a morality tale and along the way we are treated to endless scenes of drug abuse, prostitutes and enough foul language for three films. Scorsese film is more of a satire that Stone&#8217;s Wall Street with the simple pursuit of money, drugs and women.The movie follows Jordan Belfort (played to perfection by Leonardo DiCaprio) as he begins his career as a nave Wall Street stock broker and grows into a heartless manipulator, selling junk to his clients and fixing stocks to get rich.  The real Jordan Belfort, whose book the movie is based on, was an expert salesman, who is more than willing to teach others how to sell. Donnie Azoff (nicely played by Jonah Hill) is his first partner and quickly increases to include a motley group who follow whatever Belfort tells them to do. Soon, Belfort forms a brokerage company (with the prestigious name Stratton Oakmont) pushing penny stocks at first, then moving to mainstream stocks and even an IPO.Belfort is introduced to drugs in his first job by Mark Hanna (a small but great performance by Matthew McConaughey) who informs him that cocaine is part of the job requirement.  As the film progresses, everyone working for Belfort is on as many drugs as possible.  Quaaludes are given special notice as a drug of choice (known to users as panty droppers, as they made women horny as hell and guys the stamina to go all night). There is a comic scene where Belfort and Azoff overdose on the famously potent Lemon 714 Quaaludes where both can barely talk.Leonardo DiCaprio turns in a great performance as Jordan Belfort; his character carries the film, being onscreen for all but a few scenes. One of many memorable scenes is when Belfort is saying farewell to the members of Stratton Oakmont is very poignant and emotional. Jonah Hill is excellent as Belfort&#8217;s closest friend and associate, as he learns from his mentor and then turns against him when Belfort is caught by the Feds. Rob Reiner is excellent as Belfort&#8217;s father.  I had not seen Margot Robbie prior to Wolf, and was impressed by her performance as Belfort&#8217;s second wife.At just under three hours, The Wolf of Wall Street could have undergone some cutting. There are several scenes, such as the thieving butler Belfort employs, which did not add much to the story.  Some of the drug scenes could have been shortened or cut. Once the drug use of Belfort and his associates was established there wasn&#8217;t much need to keep plugging how stoned everyone was.Overall, The Wolf of Wall Street is fun to watch and a cautionary tale; a surprising film from Martin Scorsese in that it is a departure from his gritty films (Gangs of New York and The Departed).  Many people will be turned off by the orgy scenes and all too frequent use of the F-bomb.

This is assuredly the film that Scorsesse set out to make, and he made it well.Unfortunately, it's also not a film that rewards the viewer. Ultimately, you get three hours of over-the-top reprehensible behavior by a group of primary characters, not a single one likable. The sex and drug use is as over-the-top and graphic as I've ever seen in a mainstream movie (read: non-NC17).You see bad men (and women) doing bad things.Unfortunately, what you don't see, and don't get, is any reason to invest in this film. There isn't a single major character that is depicted as tragically flawed. There's no redemption. There's no penance. The main character, Jordan Belfort (Leanardo DiCaprio) is portrayed as ignorant, ghastly, shallow, and corrupt to the core. And he's pretty much this way from the first time we see him on the screen. There's no arc to his character. As far as we know, he's not a good man corrupted by the wolves of Wall Street. And he's not a corrupt man redeemed by later heroic behavior or self reflection. He is simply a bad man whose bad deeds compound as he gets richer. The same comments pretty much apply to everyone else with significant screen time.As the movie progresses, one increasingly feels a sense that &#34;I hate all these people, and the faster they go down, the better.&#34; But when they inevitably do, there's really no real payoff. Not in a single case. Again, we have no reason to believe that any of these people were ever good, or that when any of these pigs met their slaughter, any became good.If there's a message here, I guess it's this: &#34;If you combine the lesser elements of society with unfathomable amounts of money, all paths lead to the most base types of behavior.&#34; Perhaps in the era of Justin Bieber there's even a universal parable in there somewhere. But without showing us why we should care, that's scant payoff for three hours of screen time.",2,Gratuitously pornographic.

Martin Scorsese can do no wrong, in his own mind. He can glue in scenes that have little or no bearing on the plot, because he thinks they're entertaining. He's right, but the result is a three hour epic with an hour and a half story. Meanwhile, there are no sympathetic characters to latch onto and root for. Everyone is a greedy, selfish and largely ignorant crook. They are gross, indecent drug addicted thieves. How nice.On the other hand, the film is in constant motion. Scenes swing back and forth before they go stale, there is constant action, pumped by the characters' excess cash, and all kinds of backdrops (Italy, Switzerland, Caribbean, Long Island) to keep your interest. And it's so far removed from civilized society you can't help but laugh. It is colorful, active, vile and violent. It's got love, hate, betrayal, loyalty and stupidity. Something for everyone, but clearly not for the whole family.The unfortunate result is disgust. You leave the theater ready to move to a desert island. Your fellow human beings are scum. The whole financial underpinning of the nation is a fraud. If you trust anyone, you're a fool. Have a nice day.Maybe Scorsese is on a morality trip and wants you feel revulsion. Maybe the hilarity of it all is the sugar that helps the medicine go down. Maybe.Scorsese made just excellent use of the potentially and usually dull office scenes. An absolute army of extras filled the trading floor, and their shenanigans while &#34;working&#34; are hysterical. It's all high school testosterone, from spitballs to tackles and fistfights. They stand on their desks. They walk on their hands. They tend their goldfish (until the boss swallows it live).The after hours parties fueled by the company's obscene profits are hugely noisy, colorful debaucheries, worthy of Caligula. A fraternity blowout of major proportions.And the performances are first rate. Everybody comes through for Scorsese. But the entire package leaves you empty, relieved it's over and specifically not longing for more.David Wineberg",3,Was missing the kitchen sink,1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,2145,"['hubris', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'two', 'versions', '34', 'hero', '34', 'director', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'own', 'mind', 'can', 'glue', 'scenes', 'have', 'little', 'bearing', 'plot', ""'re"", 'entertaining', 'right', 'result', 'three', 'hour', 'epic', 'hour', 'half', 'story', 'Meanwhile', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'latch', 'root', 'Everyone', 'greedy', 'selfish', 'largely', 'ignorant', 'crook', 'are', 'gross', 'indecent', 'drug', 'addicted', 'thieves', 'How', 'nice.On', 'other', 'hand', 'film', 'constant', 'motion', 'Scenes', 'swing', 'back', 'forth', 'go', 'stale', 'constant', 'action', 'pumped', 'characters', 'excess', 'cash', 'kinds', 'backdrops', 'Italy', 'Switzerland', 'Caribbean', 'Long', 'Island', 'keep', 'interest', 'so', 'far', 'removed', 'civilized', 'society', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'colorful', 'active', 'vile', 'violent', 'got', 'love', 'hate', 'betrayal', 'loyalty', 'stupidity', 'Something', 'everyone', 'clearly', 'not', 'whole', 'family.The', 'unfortunate', 'result', 'disgust', 'leave', 'theater', 'ready', 'move', 'desert', 'island', 'fellow', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'scum', 'whole', 'financial', 'underpinning', 'nation', 'fraud', 'trust', 'anyone', ""'re"", 'fool', 'Have', 'nice', 'day.Maybe', 'Scorsese', 'morality', 'trip', 'feel', 'revulsion', 'Maybe', 'hilarity', 'sugar', 'medicine', 'go', 'down', 'Maybe.Scorsese', 'made', 'just', 'excellent', 'use', 'potentially', 'usually', 'dull', 'office', 'scenes', 'absolute', 'army', 'extras', 'filled', 'trading', 'floor', 'shenanigans', '34', 'working', '34', 'are', 'hysterical', 'high', 'school', 'testosterone', 'spitballs', 'tackles', 'fistfights', 'stand', 'desks', 'walk', 'hands', 'tend', 'goldfish', 'boss', 'live', '.The', 'hours', 'parties', 'fueled', 'company', 'obscene', 'profits', 'are', 'hugely', 'noisy', 'colorful', 'debaucheries', 'worthy', 'Caligula', 'fraternity', 'blowout', 'major', 'proportions.And', 'performances', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'Everybody', 'Scorsese', 'entire', 'package', 'empty', 'relieved', 'specifically', 'not', 'longing', 'more.David', 'Wineberg']",N/A

So many of his most important movies have NYC as their main or only setting. That's true of Wolf, of course. Going back to Who's that Knocking at my Door? and Mean Streets, running through Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, King of Comedy, After Hours, Goodfellas, and more, Scorsese is always right at home in NYC, the city where he was born and bred. When he returns to that turf, as he does here, it's an occasion to see what stays the same in the director's work and what changes.Now in his 70s, Scorsese brings the same energy to Wolf that he put into Mean Streets in his early 30s. But now there is an elegance and majesty to his filmmaking that contrasts nicely with the erratic and damaging behavior of his characters. Wolf has the sweep of an historical epic and the intimacy of a journalistic character study. The main character is, of course, Jordan Belfort, embodied by Leo DiCaprio in a virtuoso that deserves every rave its gotten.Belfort, like previous Scorsese protagonists, is a performer--compare him with Travis Bickle acting out in front of his mirror, Jake La Motta in the ring and in the dressing room and onstage, with Rupert Pupkin taking over the set of Jerry Lewis' show, with Jesus stumbling through the Sermon on the Mount in Last Temptation. DiCaprio has been stellar in every movie he's done with Scorsese, but this is his best part and he makes the most of it.The rest of the cast cannot help but be in DiCaprio's shadow a bit, but they still turn in delicious performances. One person who hasn't gotten much attention is Kyle Chandler as the FBI agent who is as subtle as DiCaprio is over the top. The two make perfect foils for one another and Chandler delivers my favorite line of the movie--when he's grilling DiCaprio on the latter's yacht, and tells him that he's dealt with many douchebags in his line of work, but Jordan Belfort is different. The other crooks inherited douchebaggery from their fathers and grandfathers; according to Chandler, Jordan got that way all on his own.I don't classify the movie entirely as a comedy or as a drama. Most of all, it is a character study, a case study in context of another deep textured portrait of New York. Jordan Belfort represents the very best and very worst elements of our economic system. Scorsese and DiCaprio present Belfort as he presented himself, with no apologies or judgments. It is up to the audience to sort out their own conflicted feelings about this charismatic, hard-working, prosperous, back-stabbing, selfish, cruel criminal, as the movie makes it clear in its very last, perhaps most meaningful, image.",5,"Like Goodfellas, but with REAL criminals",1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,2882,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Oscar', 'contenders', 'one', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'movies', 'many', 'years', 'important', 'state', 'biases/preferences/limits', 'start.Few', 'artists', 'define', 'place', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'Scorsese', 'defined', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'So', 'many', 'most', 'important', 'movies', 'have', 'NYC', 'main', 'only', 'setting', 'true', 'Wolf', 'course', 'Going', 'back', 'Who', 'Knocking', 'Door', 'Mean', 'Streets', 'running', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'King', 'Comedy', 'Hours', 'Goodfellas', 'more', 'Scorsese', 'always', 'right', 'home', 'NYC', 'city', 'where', 'was', 'born', 'bred', 'When', 'turf', 'here', 'occasion', 'see', 'what', 'same', 'director', 'work', 'what', 'changes.Now', '70s', 'Scorsese', 'same', 'energy', 'Wolf', 'put', 'Mean', 'Streets', 'early', '30s', 'now', 'elegance', 'majesty', 'filmmaking', 'nicely', 'erratic', 'damaging', 'behavior', 'characters', 'Wolf', 'sweep', 'historical', 'epic', 'intimacy', 'journalistic', 'character', 'study', 'main', 'character', 'course', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'embodied', 'Leo', 'DiCaprio', 'virtuoso', 'rave', 'gotten.Belfort', 'previous', 'Scorsese', 'protagonists', 'performer', 'compare', 'Travis', 'Bickle', 'acting', 'out', 'front', 'mirror', 'Jake', 'La', 'Motta', 'ring', 'dressing', 'room', 'onstage', 'Rupert', 'Pupkin', 'taking', 'over', 'set', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'show', 'Jesus', 'stumbling', 'Sermon', 'Mount', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'DiCaprio', 'been', 'stellar', 'movie', 'done', 'Scorsese', 'best', 'part', 'most', 'it.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'DiCaprio', 'shadow', 'bit', 'still', 'turn', 'delicious', 'performances', 'One', 'person', 'who', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'much', 'attention', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'as', 'subtle', 'DiCaprio', 'top', 'two', 'make', 'perfect', 'foils', 'one', 'Chandler', 'delivers', 'favorite', 'line', 'movie', 'when', 'grilling', 'DiCaprio', 'latter', 'yacht', 'dealt', 'many', 'douchebags', 'line', 'work', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'different', 'other', 'crooks', 'inherited', 'douchebaggery', 'fathers', 'grandfathers', 'according', 'Chandler', 'Jordan', 'got', 'way', 'own.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'classify', 'movie', 'entirely', 'comedy', 'drama', 'Most', 'character', 'study', 'case', 'study', 'context', 'deep', 'textured', 'portrait', 'New', 'York', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'very', 'best', 'very', 'worst', 'elements', 'economic', 'system', 'Scorsese', 'DiCaprio', 'present', 'Belfort', 'presented', 'apologies', 'judgments', 'audience', 'sort', 'out', 'own', 'conflicted', 'feelings', 'charismatic', 'hard-working', 'prosperous', 'back-stabbing', 'selfish', 'cruel', 'criminal', 'movie', 'clear', 'very', 'last', 'perhaps', 'most', 'meaningful', 'image']",N/A

This movie is such a rollercaoster ride of excess, debauchery and numerous of &#34;Oh no!&#34; moments which makes the film fly-by.  It is a rare thing to see a three hour movie these days and at the end...you feel that you only been watching the movie for only an hour and a half.  As you have probably read in previous reviews, this movie is about a group of guys who conned many people out of money using the stock market and other means.  They are not to be looked up at and some reviewers think that the main character's story doesn't deserve any screen time devoted to his criminal past.  But, it all comes down to the filmmaker wanting to tell a story of an interesting character or characters!  I had no idea who this guy was or what he was doing during the time that the movie was set.  If anything that the film did was that it showed very bad people doing very bad things and in the end, the party always dies.Couple of warnings:  This movie is graphic!  I counted at least 10 people, mostly elderly people, from the showing that I went to walking out of the movie early.  Making comments like...&#34;I can't believe they showed that!&#34; or &#34;This movie is too much for me!&#34;  I think they did not realize the graphic nature of the movie beforehand.  There is a lot of nudity and sex in this movie!  But, it needed it.  There is a lot of drug use in this movie...to which you almost feel like you are on drugs watching it.  But, it needed it.  Lots of vulgar language as well.  So if you get offended easily or if you are one of those &#34;too long&#34; complainers, it's probably best to wait and watch the &#34;tv&#34; edit of the film.  I really don't know how they are going to have a &#34;tv friendly&#34; version of this film.  It will probably be only an hour long...lol.It is one of Scorsese and Leo's best films!  Everyone in the movie was great as well!  I can't think of one bad actor in this movie.  Leo has a genious scene of physical comedy that should beat out any actor from winning any acting award this year, but he will probably get robbed again.  And Jonah Hill...he is just awesome in his role!Go and see the movie for yourselves and don't let any negative review on here dissuade you from enjoying a well crafted train wreck of characters that you don't care about, but will be totally entertained for three hours.If you don't mind lots of graphic material, than this is the movie for you.  I nominated this movie the best of 2013 because it doesn't take itself serious as other award nominated movies that have come out this past year.  The Wolf of Wall Street is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again.  Way to go Marty and Leo for another masterpiece!

The socially unaccepted vulgarities that make up much of the dialogue is part of the message of the movie.  It's theme is greed and arrogance, both anti-social traits.  The movie's point is clearly that those who devote their lives only to becoming fabulously rich, and to hell with everyone else are not intellligent or even interesting.  They only know how to buy status symbols like mansions, fancy cars, helicopters, and drugs. The only things they do or talk about, except for fleecing people, is sex and drugs. They have nothing else to fill their minds.  The cocaine gives them a false high, and their foul language is designed to put off everyone else except their money-grubbing &#34;friends.&#34; Actually, they have no real friends, nor are their wives loving and devoted.  They are accomplices, not wives.  Like the men, the women do dugs and join in sex-fests such have never been portrayed in films.

In terms of plot, Terence Winter's screenplay contains the usual clich&eacute;s associated with movies of this type: the emphasis on conspicuous consumption, the wanton disregard of Belfort and his fellow-stockbrokers for the feelings of those around them; the brazen belief that the world is their oyster.  It is the kind of world in which Michael Douglas's Gordon Gekko would not seem out of place.  Visually speaking, Martin Scorsese's film is a treat: the cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is stunning, with a series of fast cuts emphasizing the frenzied existence of those whose sole raison d'etre is the desire to make money.

And a few hours, call me back with a number, and when I asked them, ""what's the market cap of the company?"" they responded with ""what do you mean market cap?""  But he would always ask me to buy and buy, 3,500 shares?  good.  7,000 shares?  even better.  It also was the same at some stores where they almost try to force you into buying extended warranties on your computer.

An example would be Decaprio narrating his criminal techniques concerning stock trading while in the film, just like Ray Liotta in Goodfellas narrating his gangster life while on the stand in court. However, even those techniques and parallels could not save the movie from a three star rating. The plot is solid, the theme one of outlandish greed and borderline criminal activity, and the acting very good.  Leonardo Decaprio worked hard on this film, but even his hard work could save this film from mediocrity. I think Scorsese tried too hard to parallel Goodfellas, and it did not work.  Goodfellas is an outstanding movie that brings one into the life of a gangster in a way that we can all visualize, but The Wolf fails in this regard.

Since the story seemed to have credence &#34;based on true events&#34; I did a little research nd came away with the same observation.I like DeCaprio's work and I thought he was superb in The Aviator and great in The Great Gatsby and Catch Me If You Can but there is a point where one's movie career seems to be somewhat &#34;type-casted&#34;.

If you want a period piece you want Russell Crowe (Noah, Master and Commander, & Gladiator, etc) and if you want an actor that evokes &#34;smarm&#34; then DiCaprio seems to be your man.

1686815,AVEVNXZGYY2CE,B00H9KKGTO,GadgetChick,"[0, 0]","The the multitude of other reviews have pretty much covered it, but here's what I'll say.- If you've seen &#34;Boiler Room,&#34; you basically know the story - &#34;pump and dump&#34; stock scheme ensnares brokers and clients both. This is the story as told by the &#34;Michael and/or Jim&#34; characters from Boiler Room, rather than the story told by one of the brokers. It does not make for a more interesting story, as told by the guy at the top who had more drugs, hookers and excess than the rest. What Boiler Room had, but this movie lacks, is the story of the average people who were swindled out of their life savings by slick brokers who only cared about commissions. There is absolutely no perspective given in &#34;Wolf of Wall Street&#34; about the people who were victimized by Belfort and his lumpy minions, and I think the story is incomplete without that perspective.- Whoa, NELLY does this movie have a lot of naked people in it. Originally, I planned to see this in the theater with my parents - I am REALLY GLAD we decided against that idea as I would have been mortified, the entire time. WARNING to ALL sons and daughters, of any age, anywhere - this is not a movie to see with your parents, no matter how cool or open-minded they are. If you think Game of Thrones has a lot of nudity and sexual content? Watch this movie. It makes Game of Thrones look like Reading Rainbow.- I have to really question glorifying the activities and attitudes of a guy like Jordan Belfort, in a THREE HOUR movie. There are some really funny parts to the movie, to be sure. I really enjoyed the interactions between Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill - Hill is honestly just great in this movie, he gave a stellar performance. I really liked Rob Reiner as Belfort's dad. But overall, the movie doesn't really make it seem like being a drug and sex addict with no sense of morals, decency or responsibility is a bad thing. There's no real denoument in which Belfort gets any kind of comeuppance whatsoever, barring maybe one scene (involving his wife) towards the end of the movie. Also, as has been pointed out, the movie glosses over the fact that Belfort sold out ALL of his friends and almost all of his colleagues, sang like a canary, and bought his light sentence by rolling over for the feds. I think, for the sake of responsible storytelling, the movie could have covered that in greater depth.- Finally - this was WAY too much like Goodfellas. Come on - even DiCaprio's narration, at times, sounds almost exactly like Ray Liotta's voiceover narration in Goodfellas. It's like Scorsese just remade Goodfellas with an even more reprehensible main character, in a longer movie, with a LOT more naked people.I'm not going to say I didn't enjoy the movie; I did, or at least parts of it. There's some dialogue and a few scenes I'm still laughing about, as I remember them. I just don't think this is a masterpiece of cinema the way some of Scorsese's other movies have been. The depictions of debauchery really did overshadow the storytelling and character development. I felt several times that just as the movie was really getting somewhere, WHOOP - never mind that, let's cut to a scene with more naked people! And I don't mind naked people in movies/TV as a rule, but there is a line when nudity/sexuality crosses the line from interesting/artistic to egregious and unnecessary. And I think this movie crosses that line. It's not so much that I find the salaciousness disturbing or amoral or whatever, just that whatever story was in there couldn't get told because the movie was so focused on depicting excess. After the third or fourth naked party scene - okay. We get it already.It's worth a watch if you like DiCaprio - he's great in this. If you like Scorsese, you might be a little disappointed. If you need something you can watch with your mom - please, PLEASE pick something else.

This is one of the loudest, crudest, foul-mouthed, misguided messes ever put on film - and it stretches to three hours (for those with a strong enough stomach to last through that much lying, stealing, crime, debauchery, all manner of substance abuse, and worse yet, the mean-spirited manner of treating gullible people who cannot afford to be scammed into poverty.Wikipedia has a bit a different stance: 'Jordan Ross Belfort is an American motivational speaker and former stockbroker. He was convicted of fraud crimes related to stock market manipulation and running a penny stock boiler room, for which he spent 22 months in prison.' In The Wolf of Wall Street Leonardo DiCaprio plays Belfort, a Long Island penny stockbroker who served 36 months in prison for defrauding investors in a massive 1990s securities scam that involved widespread corruption on Wall Street and in the corporate banking world, including shoe designer Steve Madden. But neither of those capsules prepares us for the outrageously humiliating debauchery of this film's presentation. It is noisy, unremittingly loud and crude, has a script that basically consists of expletives, and in the end makes us feel embarrassed to be a member of the human species. That the film won such acclaim and placed DiCaprio as an Oscar candidate and did so well financially tells us a lot about our current state of mind and taste. To this we've come?

With the film, there is a change in certain events, some shown before others, the film sets its own pace. When this film starts for most of it, the viewer is dumbfounded by the amazing sense of humour, the rapid dialogues and its amusing pace. You can feel the director was controlling my eyes and where they land.Brief intro of the plot - A wealthy stock broker who has discovered formulas to earn very high commission on the sale of penny stocks. So of course he idolises money, he preaches what he has been preached earlier. He gets qualified and unqualified money hungry men sets them in a place and then teaches them everything he knows. He never screws with their pay checks and he doesnt look at any obstacles, he has a very optimistic hedonist point of view of the world. There is a lot of drugs and alcohol in the film but irrespective of where you belong, you will like what you see.What I liked -  Some 9 scenes in the film I found very funny. You like every single character, whether its Jonah Hill, the guy from walking dead, whether its Matthew McConaughey, the Vice Presidents, his wives, the kids, the cops. The sets are amazing and I think the overall editing is fantastic. BUT I COULDN'T help but feel Martin Scorsese took somewhat of a backseat in this film and forgot one or two of his own inhibitions in trying to bring the protagonist to the front. Leonardo is there in every scene, it looks like he is acting for the first time in his life, he is that riveting.I didn't dislike a single thing about the film. I didn't dislike the length.(Spoiler) My favourite scenes were always the ones where he is doing drugs. I loved the scene where he is paralysed on the ground.  I also think Matthew McConaughey's part was acted very well. Jonah Hill's introduction was hilarious.Overall -  I can tell for sure I will see this film at least once more in my life.

1686861,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00H9KKGTO,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 4]","A surprising film indeed. What is it about?First of all it is about 45 minutes too long. The sex scenes and the orgies could have been cut short to a simple ellipse instead of a graphic depiction. That is one easy shortening that should have been used. Same thing with the drug scenes that are by far too numerous and too long. We got the message very fast that to succeed in Wall Street you have to be a sex addict, a drug-cocktail addict, an alcohol addict, a money addict, a money-lifting addict, a thief, a liar and a few other little things like that. We know that, we knew that and we have known it since at least American Psycho.So, what is the original message?It is simple. Anyone can succeed like that wolf in the USA in the most ruthless way possible with the most illegal and unethical means possible because the system is a filter-less abyss. There is no real filter to prevent these crimes and other offenses. There is no protection of any kind to prevent criminal minds to get into the business. The American system after 1987, date of the beginning of the wolf's career, is absolutely deregulated and it will be so till a very recent period, till a couple of years after the 2009 crisis. What's more most of those who are supposed to look after the various crimes committed in the financial field can be bought for a pittance, at times a little bit more, be they American, or Swiss, or whatever affiliation they have as for financial paradise.Yet the FBI cannot be bought up. They are incorruptible, which I doubt very much. But well we can always think there is an Eliot Ness in every FBI special agent.The worst part is that these people when they are caught will become, in their own interest, the most talkative monsters you can imagine. They will accept a deal at once. The principle is simple: ""In Wall Street there is NO friend!"" Partners, associates, colleagues, collaborators are ALL, all of them, nothing but competitors, enemies. As long as they can work as a pack they will, but as soon as the pack is under a real menace each one will go alone against the pack if necessary. A starving pack in the Rocky Mountains may die though if it comes to that the outcome will be ONE survivor and ONE survivor only. Wolves are cannibals in situations where survival is at stake.As for a meaning that is very light and very nave. ""Lupus est homo homini, non homo, non quom qualis sit novit"" (wolf is man to man, no man when he does not know who the other is). Erasmus (15th-16th centuries) quoted it from Plautus (3rd-2nd centuries BCE), the original author, and then Thomas Hobbes in the 17th century made it a central concept of his vision of humanity in his work Leviathan. Nothing new under the sun. This phrase ""Man is wolf to man"" has become a catch phrase with the Industrial Revolution and Marxism. Though capitalism, and any form of it, did not invent it. Gladiators were Romans. The Celts burnt their criminals. And the modern times invented a lot of such cruel treatment of human beings as slaves or as playthings for sadistic or didactic practices, even calling it the death sentence. A woman was recently raped in public by more than fifteen men in a village in eastern India on the order of the village elders because she refused to break off with a man, her lover, who was from another village that was sexually off limits for these elders. Maybe the saying does not apply to women?When we thus look at the film and wonder what makes it in anyway different, original, new, we have to say it is a brilliant cinematographic illustration of a common place idea and situation. The catch phrase of the film is that New Zealand has become the haven, paradise, refuge and shelter of all those criminals, financial, copyright or data all together and the same, where they can go on striving without any menace from the FBI. Australia is a second haven of the type and then Russia too is trying to set her feet in that juicy field. The juice is not only money, it is also a lot of blood.That last remark, the catch phrase, the final scene of the film is the most powerful argument for a shorter film, a film that could have been a lot shorter. ""Sell me that pen"" becomes very shallow and trite after three hours of ranting, raving, partying, raping, raging, and so many other off-normalcy attitudes, actions and principles.  The film is in itself an orgy of ever and endlessly repeating sequences: we are framed in a million images of exactly the same value and tinge and color and hue. What a shame!

Panned by most of the people I know, I avoided it at the theater and then finally streamed the film when I had a whole three hours available - and it was once of the best three hours I've had with a film in a long time.The very beginning sets the tone: it's loud, vulgar and excessive. It's the Scorsese we know from Goodfellas and watching him bring truly unlikeable characters to life is one of his trademark directorial maneuvers. There are F-bombs galore, drugs, endless tracking shots, freeze frames, voiceovers, the mandatory great soundtrack and a feeling at the end of the film that we truly know the characters. It's his familiar story of a prideful, egotistical anti-hero slipping into an illegal world to live an indulgent life that ultimately becomes his undoing and here he executes spectacularly well.DiCaprio and HIll deliver some of their finest performances as the Quaalude-popping miscreants serving up darkly funny performances that balance the excess of this parallel world. You'll hate Wall Street all the more after viewing but it's hard to not to become enticed by their antics of running a financial frat house representing so many of the things that have gone wrong in their real life counterparts.There's no doubt this is a polarizing film and not one you'd want to watch with your in laws but as a slice of life where the volume is permanently set to 11, it's mesmerizing, funny, tragic and genuinely some of the year's best entertainment.",5,One of the year's best films and DiCaprio shines again,1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,1638,"['Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Marmite', 'movies', ""'re"", 'going', 'love', 'hate', 'probably', 'convincing', 'way', ""'ve"", 'made', 'decision', 'Panned', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'avoided', 'theater', 'then', 'finally', 'streamed', 'film', 'when', 'had', 'whole', 'three', 'hours', 'available', 'was', 'once', 'best', 'three', 'hours', ""'ve"", 'had', 'film', 'long', 'time.The', 'very', 'beginning', 'tone', 'loud', 'vulgar', 'excessive', 'Scorsese', 'know', 'Goodfellas', 'watching', 'bring', 'truly', 'unlikeable', 'characters', 'life', 'one', 'trademark', 'directorial', 'maneuvers', 'are', 'F-bombs', 'galore', 'drugs', 'endless', 'tracking', 'shots', 'freeze', 'frames', 'voiceovers', 'mandatory', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'feeling', 'end', 'film', 'truly', 'know', 'characters', 'familiar', 'story', 'prideful', 'egotistical', 'anti-hero', 'slipping', 'illegal', 'world', 'live', 'indulgent', 'life', 'ultimately', 'undoing', 'here', 'spectacularly', 'well.DiCaprio', 'HIll', 'deliver', 'finest', 'performances', 'Quaalude-popping', 'miscreants', 'serving', 'up', 'darkly', 'funny', 'performances', 'balance', 'excess', 'parallel', 'world', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'Wall', 'Street', 'more', 'viewing', 'hard', 'not', 'become', 'enticed', 'antics', 'running', 'financial', 'frat', 'house', 'representing', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'have', 'gone', 'wrong', 'real', 'life', 'doubt', 'polarizing', 'film', 'not', 'one', ""'d"", 'want', 'watch', 'laws', 'slice', 'life', 'where', 'volume', 'permanently', 'set', '11', 'mesmerizing', 'funny', 'tragic', 'genuinely', 'year', 'best', 'entertainment']",N/A

For the first decade or so of his career, he's made some of the best films EVER MADE (TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL, THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST, GOODFELLAS, MEAN STREETS, AFTER HOURS) and for the last twenty-three years, I don't believe the man has made a truly great film (THE DEPARTED was decent for what it was, but hardly Best Picture material). But suddenly, THE WOLF OF WALL STREET came around, and I felt like the past 23 years of his films, ranging from respectfully decent to tragically god-awful, had been just a bad dream, and with his three-hour character study of a young man coming from nothing with just an insatiable hunger to consume more in just a few years than a thousand people could consume in their collective lifetimes, Scorsese becomes an alchemist, transforming the most deporable human behavior into film gold.The film follows a few years in the life of real-life figure Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio), as he seeks his fortunes on Wall Street. He gets life advice in the form of an immoral senior trader at the first company he works for (gloriously personified by Matthew McConaghey) as he extolls the ""virtues"" of theft, greed, drugs and masturbation. He then starts his first big day on Wall Street on October 19th, 1987, aka Black Monday, where the stock market took its biggest fall since the 1929 crash. Out of work, he goes to work at a semi-legal brokerage house working out of a strip-mall that sells ""penny stocks"", which are stocks for extremely small companies with little to no net worth. He uses his slick salesmanship and gets a ridiculous 50% commission for everything he sells, which is something unheard of at the major firms. Then, he attracts those same people as well as the cousin-marrying schlub Donny (a glorious Jonah Hill), to join him in his own firm he calls Stratton-Oakmont (to give it that old money WASP-y flavor). His main salespeople are all weed dealers, because they know how to push their product. Stratton grows at a geometric rate as it continues selling the penny stocks and parlaying those sales into the established stocks, and suddenly, in his mid-twenties, he's making millions of dollars. He's also engorging himself on hookers, cocaine and his personal favorite drug, quaaludes like they're all going out of style. Despite being married, he attracts what he believes is the perfect woman for him, a former Miss Long Island, the beautiful Naomi (newcomer Margot Robbie), and soon leaves his wife for her. He buys mansions, huge yachts, expensive sportscars and even a helicopter. He even has an enforcer of sorts in his father Max (a BRILLIANT Rob Reiner), who tries to lead him on a smarter path, but Jordan believes himself invincible, even when he is confronted by FBI Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) who has pretty much everything he needs to arrest Jordan for all of the many illegal things he's doing on a daily basis. Alas, the mighty must fall at some point, and a downward spiral of events threatens everything Jordan has built his life upon.This could have easily been a cautionary tale ala Oliver Stone's WALL STREET, which has a more cathartic ending, but that tale has already been told. Instead, Scorsese dares you to find these utterly disgusting and amoral characters sympathetic at points, and dares you even further to actually root for them. This seems to be the thesis of this film, and if Leonardo DiCaprio hadn't crafted the best performance of his career in this film, it would have been all for naught. As Belfort, DiCaprio is utterly magnetic and daringly seductive. He's not an evil man, nor are the people that surround him; he comes off as more of a charming rogue bucking the system rather than a Gordon Gekko-type whose every move drips with malevolence. This is not to say that Jordan is a good guy; he's a horrible human being, but the film allows you as the audience to make your judgments about him and his acolytes. While the film could be conceived as a drama, it lacks the necessary aforementioned catharsis to allow it to drift too far into drama and plays more as not only a vicious satire of the lifestyles of the money-obsessed 80's and early 90's, but also as high comedy. If you're not laughing a lot at the debauchery on display within the opening minutes of the film, THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is decidedly not a film for you. Much has also been made of the film's record-breaking use of the F-word in its many iterations (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, etc.), and again, if you find that word offensive, even when not used in astounding excess, this is not a film for your tastes.Much credit is to be given to screenwriter Terence Winter, who has also written several episodes of THE SOPRANOS and BOARDWALK EMPIRE, who gives each character, no matter how small, a very specific voice. And the myriad of performers who make small but important contributions such as Joanna Lumley, Jon Favreau, Jon Bernthal and a brilliant Jean Dujardin really round out the cast. Hill continues his upswing into more significant films (as long as I can forget about THIS IS THE END), and continues to prove that he's more than just a one-trick pony.Let us not forget Scorsese, who not only directs the film with verve, excitement, energy and precision, but lets most of his thematic necessities go for this film, which is unlike anything he's ever done. There's no examples of the Madonna/Whore complex; there's no heavy Catholic symbolism; I don't even think there's a Rolling Stones song in the soundtrack. And the three-hour run time of the film breezes by.THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is a startling revelation of a film from a director who I had believed had his best days behind him, but if nothing else, it proves that an old dog can learn new tricks, even if those tricks include an EPIC quaalude crawl.",5,"Scorsese and DiCaprio elevate debauchery, excess and greed to an art form.",1390176000,"01 20,

It's like a 5 page resume. No more explanation required. People have brains and I think a lot of what people remember from movies is what they imagined rather than what they saw. I see this all the time when someone is describing a great scene and interjecting their ""inferences"" into it. The movie could have been shorter and wouldn't have lost much.But I digress. The move is great. But the over the top partying scenes are exaggerated. Even Def Leppard during their hayday when they had groupies giving them bj's under the stage during the drum solo couldn't aspire to the level of mayhem depicted in some of those scenes. I'm sure there was a lot of cheering and clapping when Jordan was giving speaches, and I'm sure there was a lot of cocaine floating around the office, but I just couldn't help but get the sense that the filmmaker was trying to embellish the partying and drunken debauchery just a bit to drive the point home.

This is a raunchy, foul-mouthed tale of American greed based on the memoirs of Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker convicted of market manipulation.2. I think this movie contains more drugs, sex, and swearing than all the other movies I saw this year put together. Of course it&#8217;s gratuitous &#8211; this guy&#8217;s whole lifestyle was gratuitous. So it works.3. This movie is also an acidly funny satire on Wall Street.4. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Jordan, a money-hungry young man with more ambition than brains.5. Jordan hires his knucklehead weed dealer friends to start a small semi-legal stockbroker firm. As they get more successful, they get less legal.6. DiCaprio has always been an excellent actor &#8211; but this may be his best performance ever. And Jonah Hill is also great as the douchebag friend.7. Jordan&#8217;s schemes were complicated and hard to understand for us regular folk, but the movie does a good job of dumbing it down &#8211; mostly by telling us that all we need to know is that he&#8217;s doing really illegal things.8.

1686901,A3OJPC8MOBI3X4,B00H9KKGTO,Jet Lagged,"[2, 10]","Leonardo DiCaprio here gives an outstanding performance as Jordan Belfort, the charismatic and shameless share promoter. Belfort graduates from plugging penny stocks to forming his own brokerage company called Stratton Oakmont. It's a great name which suggests solidity, continuity and oak lined paneling. A tradition of financial service to discerning clients. But it was all smoke and mirrors. Belfort essentially ran an illegal bucket shop operation.I had read the book ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" (written by Belfort) before so I knew what to expect from this tale of excess. Belfort was addicted to money, drugs and women. And in that order, though sometimes he indulges in all three at the one time. (You'll see how he does this in the film). Viewers will find it hard to believe that the film is tamer than the book. But it is so. DiCaprio himself has compared Belfort to a modern-day Caligula.There is a truly hilarious segment in this movie where Belfort takes a tad too many Quaaludes for comfort. I had read Belfort's account but was not prepared for DiCaprio's brilliant and hilarious onscreen portrayal of it. It's a great piece of situational comedy and would not be out of place in a Fawlty Towers episode. (In the real life incident, mercifully, there were no human causalties involved).This movie should not be compared with either of the ""Wall Street"" movies. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is more of a boisterous and venal hedonistic romp. It's all downhill though. Belfort clearly subscribes to the ""Reality is due to a deficiency of good drugs"" theory.DiCaprio's voiceovers remind me of that other excellent Scorsese film ""Casino"". There Pesci and DeNiro provide the narration from time to time. In ""Casino"" the mob guys fought with guns. In this movie Belfort's guys went to war with telephones. They are telephone terrorists with instructions to never to take ""No!"" for an answer. They are to stay on the line until ""They either buy or die"". Welcome to the world of telephone financial terrorism.The lovely Joanna Lumley makes a brief appearance in the film as one of Belfort's money couriers. Rob Reiner plays Belfort's father. Watch out for the cameo of Belfort himself. That's him playing the motivational speaker who introduces DiCaprio at the end.This film clocks in at practically 3 hours long.

It is based on the book written by John Belfort about how he went from rags to riches by swindling people out of their life savings by selling penny stocks and IPOs of companies. He hired and trained a bunch of stock brokers, some of them had no training at all or were not licensed to sell stocks, and make 50% commissions.  It was fast and easy money for the fast talking salespeople and they made millions.

The film makes it look like he was in a country club instead of prison as money can buy you anything.

It's also excessively long and could have been a great movie at just over 2 hours as the film makes its point early on and then just continues to pile on more escapades for the sake of showing them.There are great performances in the film; however, DiCaprio's is not one of them.  Of late, he's focused on playing larger than life cads who all need to be taught a lesson.  Between this, Gatsby and Howard Hughes, DiCaprio doesn't so much as create a character, but rather an archetype who may be handsome and charming on the outside, but is also a complete jerk to everyone around him.  Had DiCaprio went for a little nuance or was given some opportunity to show the inner conflict that contributed to his excessive behavior, I might have thought more of his work.  In my opinion, he's become more like Tom Cruise, merely delivering his lines with typical bravado and no depth.  He does get one moment that stands out, when he finally has his worst drug experience ever, but it's just a moment.Thankfully, Jonah Hill and many of the supporting cast get to do a lot more.  John Berenthal is great to watch, as are Margot Robbie and Kyle Chandler.

1686909,A3OD7GOXPSO9Z,B00H9KKGTO,JLR,"[0, 0]","Martin Scorsese's marvelously entertaining ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is one of those movies guaranteed to polarize viewers. It has been vilified as vulgar, sexist, obscene, immoral, disgusting, overly long, hedonistic and glorifying in its debauchery. Its controversial nature is evidence in its overall three star rating; some people love it and others hate it. Those that hate ""Wolf of Wall Street"" feel that the movie celebrates the life of crime while neglecting those who suffered from it.But those detractors have missed the point. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is supposed to be vulgar, long and hedonistic because that's how the characters are. Far from glorifying the corrupt lifestyle of a pawnbroker, Scorsese shows us just how sick and perverted it is. Scorsese isn't the kind of director that's going to have characters spew banal dialogue on how wrong it is for pawnbrokers to perform pump and dump scams; he just presents it. That's not moral irresponsibility; that's great film making. Why tell it when you can simply show it?Like many of Martin Scorsese's movies, the main characters in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" are ambiguous antiheroes who are neither warm or likable (and any pawnbroker that screws over victims is hardly likable), but have a snake-like fascination about them that just grips your attention. Many of the actors, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill and Rob Reiner, are given the difficult task of making these repellent characters attractive and they succeed in spades. Hill is particularly outstanding as Donnie Azoff and the sequences where he is flashing his private parts, terrorizes an employee by eating his fish and then makes fun of an associate for sucker punching him demonstrate that there's more to Hill as an actor than many people believe. Also excellent is Kyle Chandler as the shrewd FBI agent out to bring Belfort down and there's a riveting sequence where on Belfort's yacht where he tries to bribe the agent into joining him.Equally noteworthy, however, is Matthew McConaughey's memorable cameo as the man who ultimately gives Belfort the tools to succeed by adopting sex and cocaine. His character appears for only a few minutes, but those are very pivotal minutes. Everybody who saw this movie knows what I'm talking about and if you don't, let me help you: ""hoohuuum hoohuuummm hooo hooum hooo hoouuumm"" (while pounding my chest).The movie, of course, is riotously funny, probably the funniest movie Scorsese has made since ""After Hours"", but it's a different kind of funny. What offended many viewers was that the film did not depict Stratton Oakmont customers having their lives destroyed by these materialistic pigs and they even felt the movie laughed at their misfortune. But the joke isn't on the victims; it's on the characters. Or to be more precise, the joke is on us, but the VENOM is on them for disregarding human life. There's a hilarious and disturbing sequence where Belfort suffers a cerebral palsy at the moment he finds out the FBI is tapping his house phone. Not only does he have a hard time getting to his car, but when he gets home, he struggles to grab his house phone and save a patron from choking on a snack. It's a frighteningly hilarious sequence because here's a guy who ripped off millions of dollars from investments and this is where he's spending it on. And anyone who had doubts that DiCaprio had a sense of humor should check this sequence out.At first glance, one expects a spiritual successor to Oliver Stone's more conventional ""Wall Street"", but if you expect a typical crime drama where the villain gets away or achieves redemption, you don't know Scorsese. This is the same filmmaker that showed us the seductive allure and fatal consequences of operating in a crime organization (""Mean Streets"", ""GoodFellas"", ""Casino""), paralleled cops and robbers as if they were two sides of the coin (""The Departed""), expressed the ugliness of sexual jealousy and machismo behavior (""Raging Bull"") and showed how social media can turn psychopaths into heroes (""Taxi Driver"") and even celebrities (""The King of Comedy""). Scorsese is both attracted and repulsed by these antiheroes and their dark side and it's no doubt he is every bit as disgusted by their actions as many of the people who hated this movie were.""Wolf of Wall Street"", far from immoral, is a very moral movie. It's clear that, by the end, Belfort still hasn't learn his lesson and continues to have a good life while everyone else he has scammed and betrayed is suffering to this very day. Instead, the moral journey is for us, to persuade us to not follow the lifestyle of these despicable, heartless deadheads who wallow and are destroyed by their own wretched excess and hubris. That's why ""Wolf of Wall Street"" demands to be seen and why the critics who assailed the film should watch it again to get the message.",5,The detractors are wrong; this movie has something to

I wasn't sure what to expect and I admit, if this is really how wild it is in some circles of the Wall street crowd,  it's a wonder they can function.  But, yes, as many have stated, the acting is superb in this movie. The subject matter stung a lot for me, being one of the people sucked into buying penny stocks in the 90's thanks to reading glowing reports about the future of several fledgling companies, and not selling out in a timely manner and as a result loosing it all.  What stung even more was the statement in the movie that a 50% commission is made by the seller.  No idea if that is accurate, but I suspect it is.  This film shows the seedy, ugly underbelly of some Wall Street people.  And for that, I think it gets an A+.I wouldn't call this a comedy per say, but there are certainly funny parts  throughout the movie.  But to just call it a comedy is selling the whole story short.  It's much more than that.  So to all those who gave it one star, come on,  every movie can't be for the children or all proper language and no vulgarity.  That just isn't how life is,  especially relating to this particular subject matter. And not a movie for a wife to watch????  I'm the wife and I selected the movie and my husband was blown away by the movie as much as I was.  I like movies about Wall Street, it is simply a fascinating subject to me.

Nagel,"[1, 2]","Just when I thought Martin Scorsese was starting to lose it in his old age, he gives us &#34;The Wolf of Wall Street.&#34; And Martin has now found himself back in my good graces.Within the first few seconds of this movie I knew it was a winner because it immediately reminded me of &#34;Goodfellas&#34; and &#34;Casino.&#34;The opening scene, which had me laughing instantly, freezes on Jordan's face as he begins to narrate, which is very reminiscent of Henry Hill from &#34;Goodfellas.&#34;And that first scene, as wild and crazy as it is, pretty much sets the pace for the rest of the entire film.This movie is long, but it is non-stop fun, and non-stop debauchery.Drugs, sex, full frontal nudity (male and female), F-bombs dropping left and right....all of which is then followed up with more drugs and sex!Man, what a good time!Some of the scenes are so funny that you feel like you are watching a full-blown comedy. It's just so fascinating to think that this was actually somebody's life!I was originally a bit apprehensive about this movie because I knew Jonah Hill would be in it (another reason I felt Martin must be losing it!) and I am by no means a Jonah Hill fan. However, I was really surprised to find that I not only liked his performance, but his &#34;Donny&#34; was getting a good portion of all the laughs!I was never a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio either, for that matter, but his performance in this movie was outstanding. After seeing this (as well as his performance as Calvin Candy in &#34;Django Unchained&#34;) I have had a much different appreciation for the man and his talents.I'm not giving this the full 5 stars because there were a few flaws in my opinion. First, I didn't care very much for the music. Some of the songs were good choices, that added some fun to the scene, but a lot of others fell flat for me, or even seemed out of place and time. Secondly, I don't care for CGI, which is used in a few scenes (mainly involving the yacht and the helicopter).

1686935,A24UPY3K2IMZYV,B00H9KKGTO,Joseph Elliott,"[0, 1]","The Wolf of Wall Street is a little bit of a return to classic Scorsese, having more in common with Goodfellas and Casino then with his more recent cinematic achievements. It's a (corporate) crime epic of sorts, a cautionary tale about the American Dream and its pitfalls. The film, like Goodfellas, focuses on the seductive quality that a life of crime and wealth offers. A lot of people have mistaken this treatment as an endorsement of the behavior that is being portrayed, when it is merely an honest and candid insight into a side of America that no one really wants to aknowledge. Now the film could have ended up being a depressing look at a ruined life of crime or corruption, or a boring procedural on how stock fraud works. It is neither. Instead, Scorsese tells the story in the form of a dark comedy, with razor sharp writing and perfect comedic timing from his actors, all while maintaining a tense dramatic edge. The film is slickly edited, with aggressive and engaging storytelling that is typical of Scorsese. The soundtrack is excellent, and the performances are incredible across the board, with DiCaprio turning in his best work to date. For a three hour film on stock market fraud, it is ridiculously entertaining and fast paced. Its not for everyone; the easily offended should just stay away and not ruin it for those who aren't. This is one of the best films from an already accomplished director, and my personal favorite film of the year.As for the bluray package:The picture is pristine, showing off the film's excellent cinematography with clarity. Sometimes the skin tones of the actors appear a little oversaturated, but it won't bother those who don't nit-pick.The Audio is very good as well, though I won't pretend like I'm an audiophile. I could hear everything clearly.The Special features are very lacking, with only one video about the making of the film. Its informative, but more would have been nice.All in all, The Wolf of Wall Street is an excellent film, and it looks great on bluray.

1686942,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00H9KKGTO,J. Richardson,"[18, 31]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Is it brilliance, or a cinematic disaster? Well, that all depends on who you ask. With Martin Scorsese in the director&#8217;s chair and Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill taking center stage, The Wolf of Wall Street looked to be the perfect set-up for something both memorable and mesmerizing. Unfortunately, after a great deal of time and effort, it failed on both accounts. The thing is it&#8217;s hard to like someone like Jordan Belfort, and Scorsese did a good job of making the audience hate him, but the journey through his life needed to be honest enough that it felt genuine, yet written well enough that it didn&#8217;t come off as boring. Scorsese was only able to check off one of these requirements, unfortunately, and the film suffers greatly because of it.The Wolf of Wall Street follows the life of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), an American stockbroker who was convicted of committing fraud through stock market manipulation. As a young man trying to make it big, Jordan gets hired at an established Wall Street firm, passes his Series 7 Exam, and gets his brokers license, only to lose his job after the stock market crashed in 1987. After befriending Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) shortly after, the two decide to create their own firm, Stratton Oakmont. However, this firm gets its start in dealing with Penny stocks, and within no time becomes a billion dollar company that operates unconventionally, to say the least. From that point on the film becomes this huge blur of drugs, women, and legal troubles.Jordan likes doing cocaine. Jordan likes women. Jordan likes doing cocaine on women. We get it. He likes to get high, have casual sex with numerous females, and continue on with life as if all of this is normal. However, this is where The Wolf of Wall Street truly fails: it&#8217;s excruciatingly repetitive. Let me put it like this: if there were a person who went out of his or her way to see movies with nudity in them, they would think there was too much nudity in here. I&#8217;m not a prude or anything, but how much bush is too much bush? Now I&#8217;ve seen my fair share of films, but before seeing this, I was able to count on one hand how many times I&#8217;ve seen bush in a film. I managed to lose count after the first 90 minutes! As a result, I found it hard to root for Jordan towards the end after seeing him constantly cheat on both of his wives; Teresa Petrillo (Christin Milioti) and Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie).Additionally, The Wolf of Wall Street is a long movie that begins to feel long one you reach its halfway mark. Scorsese has been known to produce long films, and this is in no way his longest, but it did begin to feel overwhelming in its final arc. Furthermore, as the film trudged on, the narrative began to lose most of its focus and consistency. Jordan&#8217;s offshore account is in jeopardy, his wife&#8217;s aunt died, he&#8217;s sailing through a storm, he&#8217;s in jail, he&#8217;s out of jail, he&#8217;s back in jail, his wife is leaving him, he tries to kidnap his kid; I felt like my head was going to explode. There is simply too much going on towards the end to make it balanced, and I think Scorsese began to realize this during the film&#8217;s production. There are stories that need to be made into movies, and there are stories that would be better off as a miniseries on television. The Wolf of Wall Street falls into the latter category.That&#8217;s not to say the film is all bad, though. On the contrary, The Wolf of Wall Street provided some of the funniest moments I&#8217;ve seen in any film of 2013. For example, there is a segment where both Jordan and Donnie take Lemmon Quaaludes, but because of their old age, they took longer to kick in than a regular Quaalude. Being ignorant of this knowledge, the two business partners decide to pop multiple pills in an attempt to feel the high. However, once they finally kick in, all hell breaks loose, and Jordan practically loses control of every muscle in his body. There was also a brief segment in the beginning when Jordan meets Mark Hanna (Mathew McConaughey), and Hanna informs him of the ins and outs of wall street, which leads to a funny, and improvised, bit from McConaughey. These comedic segments were some of the most memorable parts of the film, and it&#8217;s a shame there weren&#8217;t more of them.In addition, the performances from the entire cast were phenomenal. As ugly as Jordan is as a human being, DiCaprio managed to take the role head-on and provide one of his most convincing performances to date. He was this sex-crazed, drug-addicted, money-hungry sociopath, and he was relentless in his execution. He pulled no punches&#8212;except towards the end when he &#8220;hits&#8221; Naomi&#8212;and he truly made this person come to life for three hours. Then there was Jonah, who is quickly becoming one of the most versatile performers. Although Donnie&#8217;s character never felt like a huge importance in the grand scheme of things, Jonah was still as entertaining as ever. Milioti, Robbie, and McConaughey were really enjoyable as well, but they were kind of underutilized, in my opinion.Overall Score: 6.8/10 - It&#8217;s difficult to describe a film like The Wolf of Wall Street because it isn&#8217;t inherently bad, but it does nothing to captivate the audience. It&#8217;s so hell-bent on telling the story of Jordan Belfort that it forgets to be entertaining, it forgets to be engaging, and it forgets how to make the audience care. Sure, the film may be beautifully shot, and the performances were great, but the repetitious nature of drugs, partying, and women soon lost its luster after seeing the fourth pair of breasts. There&#8217;s always a limit to these cinematic elements, and Scorsese went way beyond it.",3,"6.8/10 - Cluttered, repetitive, and overwhelming",1388534400,"01 1, 2014",2014,5837,"['Note', 'May',

If you want a film where the jerks and banksters of the world get their comeuppance this isn't it. This is the story of how it really goes down more often than not. It is also the story of how dangerous it is for the morally weak among us to be placed in positions of authority and how readily people in our society place them there because we want to get a ride on the gravy train. This story reminded me that the honest among us rarely get rich or rewarded and it's the characters just like this guy and his sycophants who do. People should watch this film because it may help them stop lying to themselves about how dishonest a lot of people are and how willing people are to be taken for a ride in the hopes of getting something for the price of setting aside their good sense.

1686949,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B00H9KKGTO,judy,"[0, 0]","I watched the fifth academy award nominee for best picture this beautiful Easter Sunday morning. I have to say I was by far impressed by what I saw; this has got to be my second favorite (After Gravity) best picture nominee of the year. The film has been tagged with multiple controversies. Those controversies only made me want to see the film even more. For starters the film broke the record for most amount of uses of the f-word. Over 500 times it is said, in fact I think just about every character in the film says it at least once. Another thing is the film is 2 hours and 59 minutes long. That one there left me in a dozy, I mean that's 'King Kong' long, but the film never bores at all. Now, the film has been debated among viewers of whether or not it deserved the academy award nod, and I must full on say it definitely deserved it. It's 'Leonardo Decaprio' and 'Martin Scorsese' at their finest moments. My review of 'The Wolf of Wall Street'.'The Wolf of Wall Street' follows the aspiring, cunning, and bright young man, Jordan Belfort (Played by Leonardo Decaprio) as he cheats wall street itself selling worthless investment bonds to the rich to feed himself money, and money and money. Soon, he's so good; he can afford to throw money out into the open sea. Life is good for Belfort, he has a beautiful wife (Played by hottie, Margot Robbie), a nice ride (It's white, not red, as he clarifies early in the film), a gigantic mansion of a home, as well as two cute wonderful children, and loads of cash to spare. However when a cop (Played by the seemingly always type casted, Kyle Chandler) get's deep into his life, Belfort must stop his bachelor lifestyle, and quit his ways for good, but for him it's more easier said than done...This is a magnificent film from the magnificent 'Martin Scorsese'. While the film would seem to drag at the exhausted 3 hours, it doesn't. It always keeps your attention. Yes, do I feel some of the materiel would have best been served cut off. Sure! I feel Scorsese should have left some of the littler details off to the side, it sure would have stream lined the film a bit more, but it's still never the less entertaining.The script, in particular shines, it plays off the talent of the cast. For me, I felt the character of Jordan Belfort, was written just for 'Leonardo Decaprio', who's particularly absorbed into the materiel delightfully. The script has a few flaws in the seams. As I've already said, it get's distracted a bit with less important side plots, and it's very un-necessary. But the script does manage to supply some witty dialogue thrown around by Hill and Decaprio. It also supplies some solid character development of Belfort; you see his money seeking self from the beginning to the end, as he struggles with himself.The script also feeds us plenty of memorable scenes that we'll end up still chewing on beyond the films ending. In particular is the scene in which 'Matthew McConaughey ' starts randomly beating his chest. Another see's 'Leonardo Decaprio' crawling up to his stripper wife, who lay's her high heeled foot on his face, and playfully pushes him off.The cast portrays their roles perfectly. 'Leonardo Decaprio' coming off a wonderful role in 'The Great Gatsby' plays his part of a self centered, money hungry, playboy with style. He adds meat to his character and, performs each line, not as a line as an actual piece of word. 'Jonah Hill' also makes the most of his time, as Belfort best friend, and co-manager, Donnie Azoff. You felt the fact he really loved his part and put ump into Azoff.I feel the film didn't shine particularly in heart. The script does its best to make you feel something for Belfort toward the end, but you don't, you see him solely as a self centered jerk. A jerk is all he will be remembered as in my book. All the characters were unlikable, even if you tried to like them, you just couldn't. Hill tried his best to make his own character likable, but he too was just a jerk. When you know that at the end of the story the only character you end up relating to is the stripper wife of Belfort, you know there's something wrong.All and all, 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is a powerfully scripted, energetic, fun, and lead excellently by the performance of Leonardo Decaprio never becomes dull in its excessive 3 hour runtime. A 4/20/14'The Wolf of Wall Street' is rated R for strong sexual content, nudity, drug use, and language throughout as well as some violence.

There almost isn't one scene that does have sex, drug use or some deviant behavior featured in it.  I can see the point of doing that in the film but I thought it was done a bit overly so by packing that into nearly all 3 hours of the film.  Sometimes so much so that it seemed to me that it almost got away from the point of the story and the main plot line that runs through it.DiCaprio does a good job at playing Belfort as he always does well playing eccentric characters in several films he has been in.  And once you filter all the crazy behavior that all the characters engage in, the plot is a good one with a message about the excesses of life and greed.Whether or not Belfort true tale is a bit of an exaggeration of his life or not, who knows, because as you know the old saying about those who write the history tend to write it from their view only.

We do not have the same taste in movies. If you like movies about orgies, constant drug ingestion and following a bunch of Wall-Street sales hustlers who follow Jordan Belfort (the Wolf) around like a bunch of moronic, juvenile, seal-clapping sheep (with no opinions or thoughts of their own) that constantly party and shout in a state of debauchery, depravity and disgust, then this movie is for you.I was immediately offended in the opening scene and thought, oh no, it's going to be more of the same, which it was. Leonardo DiCaprio has certainly crashed from his strong, sentimental hero role in the Titanic to this role, which will only make you think less of him. I kept hoping he would be caught, but Belfort keeps resurfacing over and over in his pursuit of the almighty buck throughout the movie. The character, his friends and his wife were so greedy and superficial that you spend your time hoping he gets punishment but he never really did. Exploiting others for money and it's too bad, that this expensive movie was made for it will only lead to Jordan's Belfort ideas of himself of more self-aggrandizement.I watched Pierce Morgan's interview of him and you can see that all he did, he thought was just highly amusing, which it was not. I watched him, and after this watching this movie, I will now steer clear of financial investors if they are like this narcissistic person who you know, only wrote the book for the money and the power and the fame. The only part of this movie that did make me laugh was when he overdosed on qualudes and was driving his Lamborghini home from the country club. Then that turned gruesome when his best friend almost died choking on a hot dog.Shame on you, Martin Scorsese for spending so much money and time and energy directing this awful movie and I am glad it did not win any Academy Awards, as it did not deserve any. As far as Jordan Belfort, I do hope someone stops you (he does play a cameo of himself at the end of the movie presenting DiCaprio directing a sales presentation). Obviously, you are a person of no morals and you haven't learned any.One last thing, if you like hearing the ""f"" word over and over and over, then you will like this movie. Raunchy, the height of vulgarity, obscene and immature, and just downright stupid, besides the pointless sex scenes, this movie left a strong distaste for me of all the hackers that are out there trying to sell you something. (This could have been about Bernie Madoff.) Glad the Academy Awards passed this one by too.

This is how the story goes: This is the true story of the outlandish rise and non-stop pleasure-hunting descent of Jordan Belfort, the New York stockbroker who, along with his merry band of brokers, makes a gargantuan fortune by defrauding investors out of millions. Belfort transforms from a righteous young Wall Street newcomer to a thoroughly corrupted stock-pumper and IPO cowboy. Having quickly amassed an absurd fortune, Jordan pumps it back into an endless array of aphrodisiacs: women, Quaaludes, coke, cars, his supermodel wife and a legendary life of aspiration and acquisition without limits. But even as Belfort's company, Stratton Oakmont, soars sky-high into extremes of hedonistic gratification, the SEC and the FBI are zeroing in on his empire of excess.The cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio (also produced) (impressively putting everything on-screen, emotionally, in his Oscar-nominated performance as Jordan Belfort) & Jonah Hill (just as equally impressive in his Oscar-nominated performance as Donnie Azoff) is brilliant.

The music executive produced by Robbie Robertson is brilliant.This is an outrageous, outlandishly-crafted film that is over-the-top excess of debauchery that is, unforgettably brilliant. Leonardo DiCaprio & Martin Scorsese have teamed up again for the fifth time, to do, what could arguably said, to be, their most ambitious film yet. It is also among the best films that they have done ever, together or separately, even. The addition of Hill to the team is terrific and impressive, as he is able to match DiCaprio, step by step, in going over-the-top, emotionally, in terms of performance. Margot Robbie, who played Jordan's second wife, Naomi, is also an interesting find, as well, keeping in pace with both DiCaprio & Hill. This is one of the best films of 2013, rightfully so. This was also an impressive awards contender, being nominated for many awards and winning some awards, as well, too.",5,"""The Wolf Of Wall Street"" is brilliant!",1397606400,"04 16, 2014",2014,2956,"['Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'brilliant', 'how', 'story', 'true', 'story', 'outlandish', 'rise', 'non-stop', 'pleasure-hunting', 'descent', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'New', 'York', 'stockbroker', 'who', 'merry', 'band', 'brokers', 'gargantuan', 'fortune', 'defrauding', 'investors', 'millions', 'Belfort', 'righteous', 'young', 'Wall', 'Street', 'newcomer', 'thoroughly', 'corrupted', 'stock-pumper', 'IPO', 'cowboy', 'Having', 'quickly', 'amassed', 'absurd', 'fortune', 'Jordan', 'back', 'endless', 'array', 'aphrodisiacs', 'women', 'Quaaludes', 'coke', 'cars', 'supermodel', 'wife', 'legendary', 'life', 'aspiration', 'acquisition', 'limits', 'even', 'Belfort', 'company', 'Stratton', 'Oakmont', 'sky-high', 'extremes', 'hedonistic', 'gratification', 'SEC', 'FBI', 'are', 'zeroing', 'empire', 'excess.The', 'cast', 'led', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'also', 'produced', 'impressively', 'putting', 'everything', 'on-screen', 'emotionally', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'just', 'equally', 'impressive', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'Donnie', 'Azoff', 'brilliant', 'Oscar-nominated', 'directing', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'also', 'produced', 'brilliant', 'Oscar-nominated', 'screenplay', 'based', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'book', 'Terence', 'Winter', 'brilliant.The', 'cinematography', 'Rodrigo', 'Prieto', 'brilliant', 'film', 'editing', 'Thelma', 'Schoonmaker', 'brilliant', 'casting', 'Ellen', 'Lewis', 'brilliant', 'production', 'design', 'Bob', 'Shaw', 'brilliant', 'art', 'direction', 'Chris', 'Shriver', 'brilliant', 'set', 'decoration', 'Ellen', 'Christiansen', 'set', 'dressings', 'Patrice', 'Canfield', 'Longo', 'Teresa', 'Kelly', 'Canfield', 'Jamel', 'Daniels', 'Damon', 'Hahn', 'Christoph', 'Heaps', 'Richard', 'Hoppe', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'Travis', 'Wright', 'brilliant', 'costume', 'design', 'Sandy', 'Powell', 'brilliant', 'special', 'effects', 'supervised', 'Drew', 'Jiritano', 'brilliant', 'visual', 'effects', 'supervised', 'Eran', 'Dinour', 'Joe', 'Farrell', 'Mark', 'O.', 'Forker', 'Paul', 'Graff', 'Edson', 'Williams', 'Rob', 'Legato', 'coordinated', 'Krysten', 'Pollard', 'Tessa', 'Roehl', 'brilliant', 'stunts', 'coordinated', 'G.A', 'Aguilar', 'Blaise', 'Corrigan', 'brilliant', 'music', 'executive', 'produced', 'Robbie', 'Robertson', 'brilliant.This', 'outrageous', 'outlandishly-crafted', 'film', 'over-the-top', 'excess', 'debauchery', 'unforgettably', 'brilliant', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'have', 'teamed', 'up', 'again', 'fifth', 'time', 'do', 'what', 'could', 'arguably', 'said', 'be', 'most', 'ambitious', 'film', 'yet', 'also', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'done', 'ever', 'together', 'separately', 'even', 'addition', 'Hill', 'team', 'terrific', 'impressive', 'able', 'match', 'DiCaprio', 'step', 'step', 'going', 'over-the-top', 'emotionally', 'terms', 'performance', 'Margot', 'Robbie', 'who', 'played', 'Jordan', 'second', 'wife', 'Naomi', 'also', 'interesting', 'find', 'as', 'well', 'keeping', 'pace', 'DiCaprio', 'Hill', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2013', 'rightfully', 'so', 'was', 'also', 'impressive', 'awards', 'contender', 'being', 'nominated', 'many', 'awards', 'winning', 'awards', 'as', 'well', 'too']",N/A

Wolf is less like Wall Street or Boiler Room - serious examinations of the evils of Big Finance - and more like Animal House or Van Wilder - gleeful celebrations of decadent hedonism. This film is replete with wall-to-wall sex and drugs, and is not only one of the dirtiest and raunchiest movies ever made, it's also one of the funniest. I'm not sure what necessarily constitutes an NC-17 rating, but this movie certainly toes the line. It's already infamous for dropping the most f-bombs ever, and I'm sure there's a few more records broken in its relentless nudity and substance abuse, oftentimes with both at the same time.DiCaprio deserves some sort of accolade for his brilliance. His comedic acting is like prime Jim Carrey, full or wild, rubbery physical comedy as he stumbles, dances and screams his way around the screen in a legendary performance. His sidekicks and cohorts are all similarly enjoyable as maniacs who are also permanently fried on a cocktail of narcotics.Sure, the movie hits some familiar dramatic notes to remind you that lying, stealing, greed and doping are bad. But its sermonizing is played to a bare minimum as the majority of the film is devoted to watching the filthy rich 1% having the time of their lives.

He takes the best of what he does with some signature camera work and mixes this film with a great script by Terrance Winter (Boardwalk Empire, The Sopranos) and some of the most incredible performances in this rather lengthy but completely compelling film called &#8220;The Wolf of Wall Street&#8221;. This is the unique story of the ups and down of a man who made his mark on Wall Street and then paid the price for it because he didn&#8217;t quite do it legally.Leonardo DeCaprio (Titanic, Inception) plays Jordon Belfort a wannabe player of Wall Street that not only proves to the big guns that he is not only capable of beating the big guys, but overpowering the Wall Street market to become the true leader of the pack in regards to Wall Street. Leonardo is amazing. His performance is sharp, funny, witty and often filled with the confusion and passion that is a man desperately getting everything he wants and learning the consequences of it. His luxurious life he eventually lives is sprinkled with drama, pain and heart-ache but mostly frustration at almost every turn.Jonah Hill (Moneyball, 21 Jump Street) pulls in another wonderful performance as the best friend of Leonardo who takes a chance and follows his business instincts and trusts Leonardo enough to ride this roller coaster with him.  Mathew McConaughey (Contact, Dallas Buyers Club) makes a short appearance and plays the senior stocker broker he first meets who teaches Leonardo the valuable lesson on making his mark on Wall Street, the one he eventually applies and does it his way. (Which happens to be illegal by the way.) Mathew is amazing to watch as he gives this very uniquely performed character a real sharp and yet creepy personality something you&#8217;ll not soon forget.Kyle Chandler (Zero Dark Thirty, Friday Night Lights) plays the FBI agent assigned to watch what seems to be Leonardo&#8217;s surprising rise to millionaire status and eventually figure out how and what he is doing. Kyle has some great scenes where he and Leonardo try and outwit each other.Rob Reiner (All In The Family, This Is Spinal Tap) plays Leonardo&#8217;s father and he is hysterical to watch and yet he has some more than parental guidance for his son but does it in some of the more memorable scenes you&#8217;ll ever see. Actor/Director Jon Favreau (Iron Man, Elf) even makes a fun character that also tries to guide Leonardo in the direction of righteousness, but to no avail.Joanna Lumley (Absolutely Fabulous, Late Bloomers) plays the aunt of his wife played wonderfully by Margot Robbie (Pan Am, About Time) and watching Joanna toy with Leonardo as the English royalty she it, is a pure delight in the film. She makes a very strange deal that changes the course of several actions in the film.It&#8217;s a fantastic movie and Leonardo&#8217;s best performance yet. It is so engaging that you really won&#8217;t notice the time flying by you. The overall performances and even when Leonardo breaks the fourth wall a couple times, it just makes sense and works well within the format of the movie. I loved it and yes there are a lot of &#8220;F&#8221; bombs and some sexual scenes, but they are not gratuitous and definitely move the story along in sync with characters and who they are.This is truly a great film and a roller coaster of events that are so well tied together it makes it easy to believe these events are actually based on things that really happened. Definitely a film that should not be missed and watched more than once because there is a lot packed in this one to be able to digest in one sitting.

1687023,A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY,B00H9KKGTO,MacheteJason,"[3, 9]","I saw this film in theaters and found it to be a mix of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Boiler Room. It is based on Jordan Belfort's memoir of the same name and stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort, a New York stockbroker who runs a firm that engages in securities fraud and corruption on Wall Street in the 1990s. In my opinion, the film is really about a wealthy man who has addictions so the Wall Street setting almost seems like a mere backdrop. There is plenty of sex, drugs, vulgar language, violence and even some incest in this film. Scorsese had to edit sexual content and nudity to avoid an NC-17 rating. It sets the record for the most uses of the f-word in a mainstream non-documentary film with over 500 uses of the word. The film received positive reviews from critics, but was also controversial for its ""moral ambiguity, presence of drugs, and use of animals"". It was a little more hardcore than I expected but audiences who love wild rides will enjoy it. You don't see many no holds barred movies like this anymore since R-Rated films are something of a rarity now.The audience loved the movie until the second half (it is 3 hours long) when the tone changed from happy-go-lucky to depressing as Leo's character spins out of control. Then everyone in the theater was silent as we saw cocaine and quaaludes being consumed in mass quantities. A happy balance is never achieved during the drug scenes because it seems to be glorifying substance use at times but then condemning drug abuse at other times. The film doesn't hold back showing the nasty effects of drugs and debauchery. Leo climbs into his car after a drug overdose and the results aren't pretty. The movie does convey how money, power and drugs can wreck your life. Though the film does generate some laughs I would deem the comedy as mostly the dark satire variety that leaves you feeling sorry about people who let their ambitions get out of control. The characters and plot could have been fleshed out a little more because most of the focus is on Leo. I prefer Oliver Stone's Wall Street but this film is worth viewing if you want a darker view of high finance.",4,The Wolf of Wall Street,1391212800,"02 1, 2014",2014,2144,"['saw', 'film', 'theaters', 'found', 'be', 'mix', 'Fear', 'Loathing', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'based', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'memoir', 'same', 'name', 'stars', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Belfort', 'New', 'York', 'stockbroker', 'who', 'firm', 'securities', 'fraud', 'corruption', 'Wall', 'Street', '1990s', 'opinion', 'film', 'really', 'wealthy', 'man', 'who', 'addictions', 'Wall', 'Street', 'setting', 'almost', 'mere', 'backdrop', 'plenty', 'sex', 'drugs', 'vulgar', 'language', 'violence', 'even', 'incest', 'film', 'Scorsese', 'had', 'edit', 'sexual', 'content', 'nudity', 'avoid', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'record', 'most', 'uses', 'f-word', 'mainstream', 'non-documentary', 'film', '500', 'uses', 'word', 'film', 'received', 'positive', 'reviews', 'critics', 'was', 'also', 'controversial', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'presence', 'drugs', 'use', 'animals', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'hardcore', 'expected', 'audiences', 'who', 'love', 'wild', 'rides', 'will', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'many', 'barred', 'movies', 'anymore', 'R-Rated', 'films', 'are', 'something', 'rarity', 'now.The', 'audience', 'loved', 'movie', 'second', 'half', '3', 'hours', 'long', 'when', 'tone', 'changed', 'happy-go-lucky', 'depressing', 'Leo', 'character', 'control', 'Then', 'everyone', 'theater', 'was', 'silent', 'saw', 'cocaine', 'quaaludes', 'being', 'consumed', 'mass', 'quantities', 'happy', 'balance', 'never', 'achieved', 'drug', 'scenes', 'be', 'glorifying', 'substance', 'use', 'times', 'then', 'condemning', 'drug', 'abuse', 'other', 'times', 'film', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'showing', 'nasty', 'effects', 'drugs', 'debauchery', 'Leo', 'car', 'drug', 'overdose', 'results', 'are', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'movie', 'convey', 'how', 'money', 'power', 'drugs', 'can', 'wreck', 'life', 'film', 'generate', 'laughs', 'would', 'deem', 'comedy', 'mostly', 'dark', 'satire', 'variety', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'people', 'who', 'let', 'ambitions', 'get', 'control', 'characters', 'plot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'little', 'more', 'most', 'focus', 'Leo', 'prefer', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Wall', 'Street', 'film', 'viewing', 'want', 'darker', 'view', 'high', 'finance']",N/A

Can't we figure out what is going on through dialogue and visuals?  Well, not in this case as there is precious little dialogue.  Can you imagine a ""Casablanca"" or a ""Lawrence of Arabia"" in which Rick or Lawrence narrate?  People just have long shouting matches.  You know, like Ray and his put upon wife in GFs and Stone and DeNiro in C.  HUGO was a great departure for Scorcese.  But this is simply a rehash, and not a very good one, of things he has done before.  Jonah Hill is nothing short of close to interesting and one never knows what draws Jordan to him nor what Hill's character brings to the table besides what look to be fluorescent teeth.  The wives are reduced to stereotypes - one the faithful woman behind the man giving sound advice when needed (and not needed) and the other the jealous harpy throwing drinks at Jordan's face.  It's not a far cry from Harry Hill's wife tracking down his girlfriend and then pointing a pistol at the sleeping Hill.  Even DiCaprio's wardrobe looks like it came off of the rack of Hill's mammoth clothes closet.  I kept thinking I've seen this scene before in ""Wall Street"" in """"Scarface"" etc.  Excess was a theme in C and a a theme in GFs and now is a theme once again in WOWS.  And it can be argued that even Shakespeare wrote numerous plays with the same theme, he at least changed the focus or the perspective from one play to another.  I recently read a review of this film in the Guardian in which the reviewer raves that this is Scorcese's best film in twenty years - what he should have added is that it's not far from being the same film he made twenty years ago.  In the end, it is all flash and frills, bed hopping and snorting.  The film is about indulgence and indeed mirrors it.  Watch the last half hour of GoodFellas after watching this and you'll  applaud DeCaprio for his spot on imitation of Liotta.  Instead of being stuck in a land in which spaghetti sauce is ketchup, Jordan must demonstrate to nabobs the art of selling pens.  Nothing shocks here though one gets the feeling Leonardo and his mentor were looking for shock value.  One simply wonders who is guilty of the most indulgence - Marty or Jordan.

But its really uninterested in those subjects. Its basically a film about the drug lifestyle told from the perspective of a drug addict. The film is so disinterested in the business it is covering that on multiple occasions it stops itself in the narration from giving explanations saying it would be &#34;boring&#34;.They don't even properly explain what &#34;pump and dump&#34; is. They spend more time lecturing in extreme detail about the subtilties of Quaalude use than they spend explaining what was financially going on. Even though the film has next to nothing to do with &#34;Wall Street&#34;, the filmmakers keep trying to push the message that its all the same thing. I dont think they managed to capture accurately most of what the scandals around Jordan Belfort were about. Years ago, &#34;Boiler Room&#34; (the film) actually did it better.To a degree, the film sometimes seems like its often actually telling the story of Martin Scorsese's drug-fueled lifestyle in the 1970s more than that of Jordan Belfort. The great flaw of the film is excess. Its a very long film and filled with sex scenes and drug scenes that quickly seem to have no particular point at all. The film could have been cut in half and been much better.Leonardo Di Caprio gives an unexceptional performance. The problem is that his character isn't much more than a one-dimensional sales hustler with no particular depth and sophisitication. His life is drugs and thats about it. The supporting cast is even less interesting because every character outside the lead is basically a sketch.The worst thing that could be said about the film is that its almost at the level of being a third-rate copy of earlier better films by the same director like Goodfellas and Casino. The film lacks a &#34;human&#34; core and an interesting story. Sex scenes, drug scenes and a degree of humor just can't carry it alone.

1687039,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00H9KKGTO,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[15, 24]","Okay, so, Martin Scorsese knows how to make a visually arresting film. This movie has all the hallmarks of great cinematography, great framing, snappy editing, and luscious attention to detail. If your eyes were mouths, they'd be crying drool. If that makes any sense.The problem -- and I'd say this is a problem that extends to a lot of movies these days -- is that so much time was spent on this film's superficial beauty that the actual story took a back seat to the sweaty, round, booty-liciousness of it all.This movie is about Jordan Belfort, a consummate salesman who gets involved with stock trades and discovers that he has both the slick patter and the complete lack of morals needed to bilk unwitting investors out of millions of their dollars. Thus begins his predictable decline into a world of sex, drugs, and rock and roll (of the ""Money for Nothing"" variety).Let me be clear: this is an entertaining film. However, the makers of the movie were nearly as gluttonous as its protagonist, and what could easily have been a tightly crafted ninety minutes turns into three hours of repetitive T&A; and coke-fueled manipulation, most of it making the same basic point, over and over and over and over again. And, hey, I like a nice, round booty just as much as the next guy, and I don't mind a few midget jokes, a few drug jokes, and a bit of anti-hero characterization here and there. But this movie is just packed to the gills with the stuff, to the point where you begin to wonder if Mr. Scorsese or Mr. DiCaprio needed to have nay-sayers on set to remind them that, no, not every single thing they do necessarily should make it to the screen, especially if it very closely resembles the last ten scenes they just filmed.The point being this: this isn't a terribly original film. It's a story about a young upstart that uses unscrupulous behavior to make it big at the expense of others and then realizes that his amoral behavior comes at the price of friendship, decency, and perhaps a human soul. It's an age-old story, and it's told with all the naked sumptuousness that draws audiences, but it's so enamored with it's own nipply beauty that it drags on for twice as long as it needs to. Wolves, as I've always understood them, eat quickly and thoroughly. This film, however, digests its story with the long, gluttonous patience of a snake.",3,Econom(nom nom nom)ics,1392076800,"02 11, 2014",2014,2355,"['Okay', 'so', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'how', 'make', 'visually', 'arresting', 'film', 'movie', 'hallmarks', 'great', 'cinematography', 'great', 'framing', 'snappy', 'editing', 'luscious', 'attention', 'detail', 'eyes', 'were', 'mouths', ""'d"", 'be', 'crying', 'drool', 'sense.The', 'problem', ""'d"", 'say', 'problem', 'lot', 'movies', 'days', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'film', 'superficial', 'beauty', 'actual', 'story', 'took', 'back', 'seat', 'sweaty', 'round', 'booty-liciousness', 'all.This', 'movie', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'consummate', 'salesman', 'who', 'involved', 'stock', 'trades', 'discovers', 'slick', 'patter', 'complete', 'lack', 'morals', 'needed', 'bilk', 'unwitting', 'investors', 'millions', 'dollars', 'Thus', 'predictable', 'decline', 'world', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'roll', 'Money', 'Nothing', 'variety', '.Let', 'be', 'clear', 'entertaining', 'film', 'However', 'makers', 'movie', 'were', 'nearly', 'as', 'gluttonous', 'protagonist', 'what', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'tightly', 'crafted', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'three', 'hours', 'repetitive', 'T', 'A', 'coke-fueled', 'manipulation', 'most', 'making', 'same', 'basic', 'point', 'over', 'again', 'hey', 'like', 'nice', 'round', 'booty', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'guy', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'few', 'midget', 'jokes', 'few', 'drug', 'jokes', 'bit', 'anti-hero', 'characterization', 'here', 'there', 'movie', 'just', 'packed', 'gills', 'stuff', 'point', 'where', 'begin', 'wonder', 'Mr.', 'Scorsese', 'Mr.', 'DiCaprio', 'needed', 'have', 'nay-sayers', 'set', 'remind', 'not', 'single', 'thing', 'do', 'necessarily', 'should', 'make', 'screen', 'especially', 'very', 'closely', 'last', 'ten', 'scenes', 'just', 'filmed.The', 'point', 'being', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'original', 'film', 'story', 'young', 'upstart', 'unscrupulous', 'behavior', 'make', 'big', 'expense', 'others', 'then', 'amoral', 'behavior', 'price', 'friendship', 'decency', 'perhaps', 'human', 'soul', 'age-old', 'story', 'told', 'naked', 'sumptuousness', 'audiences', 'so', 'enamored', 'own', 'nipply', 'beauty', 'twice', 'as', 'long', 'Wolves', ""'ve"", 'always', 'understood', 'eat', 'quickly', 'thoroughly', 'film', 'however', 'story', 'long', 'gluttonous', 'patience', 'snake']",N/A

1687043,A1C9N96N2M5D13,B00H9KKGTO,"marriedutopianstriver ""Seeker Of Heaven On Earth""","[6, 16]","Initially, I originally thought that I was going to have to reluctantly postpone seeing The Wolf Of Wall Street for a few months due to the fact that it appeared to be unavailable in two of the theaters closest to where I live. This would have conflicted with my late night work schedule. Please know that I am thankful for my job, but was concerned that traveling too far  would have conflicted with getting to work on time. Fortunately, I spontaneously felt guided to look again yesterday morning and observed the movie location and time listings updated to show in 2 movie theaters closest to my personal residence (which would luckily give me enough time before work).  Luckily, I had the chance to see The Wolf of Wall Street this morning and it was very much worth giving up some of my sleep time to watch.  The following are some of the reasons why: Leonardo Di Caprio is one of my top seven favorite actors and he gave a brilliant performance as a man by the name of Jordan Belfort who uses his talents to help his employees and himself successfully profit from the stock market. However, one of the harbingers pointing to what is about to happen to his schemes is shown through the clue of how he basically brags to some of his employees the ways that they have profited at the expense of their clients, without expressing at least a little remorse to how he can change things around.  Additionally, a second clue is given when Belfort's father is shown going up to his son at work and warning him that what he is doing could create unintended results in his life. Margot Robbie also gives her best, as a beautiful wife who is also equally calculating in her own way and meets DiCaprio's Belfort character during a thriving peak of his life.  Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey are among some of the famous actors included in the film. The film does show one of the men from the Wall Street industry who may have indirectly impacted his way of thinking  in relation to dealing with clients. Additionally, the movie also showed how Belfort's notoriety caught the attention of Forbes magazine. I was familiar with some of the music played in the film due to purchasing the mp3 version of The Wolf of Wall Street Soundtrack. However, there were some good songs played in the movie that were not available on the soundtrack (such as by The Foo Fighters and Sir Mix-a-Lot).  There are also many other actors and actresses in the film that are going to appeal to various men and women watching The Wolf of Wall Street. The Wolf of Wall Street is a great film to watch for those who are fans of the work of Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Matthew McConaughey, Margot Robbie and/or are curious about the life of stockbroker Jordan Belfort.",5,Days In The Life Of Jordan Belfort,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,2739,"['Initially', 'originally', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'reluctantly', 'postpone', 'seeing', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'few', 'months', 'due', 'fact', 'appeared', 'be', 'unavailable', 'two', 'theaters', 'closest', 'where', 'live', 'would', 'have', 'conflicted', 'late', 'night', 'work', 'schedule', 'Please', 'know', 'am', 'thankful', 'job', 'was', 'concerned', 'traveling', 'too', 'far', 'would', 'have', 'conflicted', 'getting', 'work', 'time', 'Fortunately', 'spontaneously', 'felt', 'guided', 'look', 'again', 'yesterday', 'morning', 'observed', 'movie', 'location', 'time', 'listings', 'updated', 'show', '2', 'movie', 'theaters', 'closest', 'personal', 'residence', 'would', 'luckily', 'give', 'enough', 'time', 'work', 'Luckily', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'morning', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'worth', 'giving', 'up', 'sleep', 'time', 'watch', 'following', 'are', 'reasons', 'why', 'Leonardo', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'one', 'top', 'seven', 'favorite', 'actors', 'gave', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'man', 'name', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'who', 'talents', 'help', 'employees', 'successfully', 'profit', 'stock', 'market', 'However', 'one', 'harbingers', 'pointing', 'what', 'about', 'happen', 'schemes', 'shown', 'clue', 'how', 'basically', 'employees', 'ways', 'have', 'profited', 'expense', 'clients', 'expressing', 'least', 'little', 'remorse', 'how', 'can', 'change', 'things', 'Additionally', 'second', 'clue', 'given', 'when', 'Belfort', 'father', 'shown', 'going', 'up', 'son', 'work', 'warning', 'what', 'doing', 'could', 'create', 'unintended', 'results', 'life', 'Margot', 'Robbie', 'also', 'best', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'who', 'also', 'equally', 'calculating', 'own', 'way', 'DiCaprio', 'Belfort', 'character', 'thriving', 'peak', 'life', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'are', 'famous', 'actors', 'included', 'film', 'film', 'show', 'one', 'men', 'Wall', 'Street', 'industry', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'indirectly', 'impacted', 'way', 'thinking', 'relation', 'dealing', 'clients', 'Additionally', 'movie', 'also', 'showed', 'how', 'Belfort', 'notoriety', 'caught', 'attention', 'Forbes', 'magazine', 'was', 'familiar', 'music', 'played', 'film', 'due', 'purchasing', 'mp3', 'version', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Soundtrack', 'However', 'were', 'good', 'songs', 'played', 'movie', 'were', 'not', 'available', 'soundtrack', 'such', 'Foo', 'Fighters', 'Sir', 'Mix-a-Lot', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'other', 'actors', 'actresses', 'film', 'are', 'going', 'appeal', 'various', 'men', 'women', 'watching', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'work', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Margot', 'Robbie', 'and/or', 'are', 'curious', 'life', 'stockbroker', 'Jordan', 'Belfort']",N/A

When I saw the film, a lot of people walked out in the first hour, and I understood why: the endless, high-speed parade of dishonesty, drugs and depravity is VERY hard to take. But those of us who stuck out the film for its nearly three-hour running time were rewarded with the most brilliant, corrosive indictment ever of Wall Street scam artists. Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio) made Bernie Madoff look like Santa Claus, and Scorsese spares us no detail of the fathomless greed of Belfort and his cronies at the bogus trading firm of Stratton Oakmont.Scorsese is obviously fascinated by these swine, as he was by the mobsters of ""Goodfellas."" But being fascinated by them and admiring them are two different things. Belfort, his right-hand man Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), and their associates are devilishly fun  to watch with their charm and chutzpah, but they are not likable or admirable for one second, and they are not meant to be. Scorsese, DiCaprio, Hill and the others let these self-aggrandizing jerks hang themselves with their own designer ties. The cast members seem to be having a blast making these characters as outrageously hateful as they possibly can, and the performances are extraordinary straight down the line. The best-acted scene I've seen this year comes in the middle of ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" between a smug Belfort and a canny FBI agent (Kyle Chandler) who is a lot smarter than Belfort--who measures a person's intelligence by the size of his bank account--gives him credit for.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a magnificently orchestrated train wreck of avarice, lust, and wasted lives.

1687079,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00H9KKGTO,M. Oleson,"[5, 13]","Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.Anytime Martin Scorsese makes a movie, film lovers line up to see what's poppin' this time around.  Rarely does he disappoint and ""Wolf"" is no exception.  In an award-worthy performance, Scorsese regular, Leonardo DiCaprio gives perhaps his greatest performance as Jordan Belfort, a real life self-made man who skirted the law selling penny stocks in the early 1990's.  Fired from his dream job of being a Wall Street broker after the market collapse of 1987, he fumbled around until he answered a want ad for a stock seller located in a strip center.  He quickly determined this was an easy, if shady, way to earn a living.  Commissions on penny stocks was 50% of the sale.Belfort was a great salesman and started his own company using the haughty title of Stratton Oakmont, recruiting friends with no experience as salesmen.  His first partner was a stranger he met in a caf&eacute;.  Donnie Azoff (excellent Jonah Hill) was just as crazy as Belfort, but without the charm and sales skills.  Still he had connections as did many of his core crew.""Wolf"" earns its `R' rating as Belfort's success is played out in unconventional ways.  Often, he would reward his staff (mostly men) with booze, drugs and women.  Not just strippers mind you but prostitutes.  He even had 3 classes of whores.  If memory serves they were blue chips, NASDAQ and pink sheets (penny stocks).After Jordan's first marriage fails, he marries Naomi Lapaglia (stunningly beautiful Margot Robbie) who he oogled and pursued after a chance meeting at a party.  The Australian Ms. Robbie, in her first big screen role, pulls off a convincing Queens accent as well as her clothes.  She's very good and very good to look at.There are many good scenes in the film including a lunch meeting between Belfort and his first boss, Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey again great in this brief appearance).  He gave Jordan some advice.  Drugs.  Another memorable scene takes place on Belfort's huge yacht which he named after Naomi.  Belfort had requested a meeting with the FBI after he discovered they had subpoenaed a list of attendees at his recent wedding.  Agent Denham (Kyle Chandler) was in charge of an investigation of fraud and comes to the boat.  Belfort pulls out the charm offensive and it appears Denham is lapping it up.  Belfort goes a bit overboard, however and makes some not-so-subtle hints of bribery.  It's a great piece of acting between the two and certainly a well written scene of which there are many.This movie doesn't pull many punches when it comes to debauchery, raunchiness and perversion so be aware.

I was throughly entertained, however, I was not engaged. To me, the story was weak. Actually, looking back, the movie did not have much of a story. The one thing about the movie I can remember was the sex. There was so much sex, I'm surprised this movie did not get an NC-17 rating. The women were mostly naked the entire time, and it felt like every other scene was some sort of copulation. One minute we are receiving exposition by Leo's character, the next Leo is giving it to some nameless actress. Seriously, I'm surprised the director, Martin Scorsese, did not show actual penetration.During my 3 hour long journey into &#34;The Wold of Wall Street,&#34; which really was Hollywood's interpretation of Wall Street, I did not feel any sort of attachment to the characters. Many, if not most, were very two dimensional. Our the primary concerns for our &#34;heroes&#34; were sex and drugs. That was it. Towards the end, we began to see the main character pay more attention to his family, especially in a scene where his wife tries to take the children. However, at this point in the story, it did not feel organic. At 2.5 hours into the movie, any depiction of the main character caring about people seemed out of place. We spent the entire movie focusing on how big of scumbag this guy was, then towards the end, they try to redeem him. The only character I truly liked was the FBI Agent, but there was so little screen time that he often came across as a cold, unlikeable, stick-in-the-mud.If you want to watch a movie with a really rich story, look elsewhere. If you watch to see a porno, look elsewhere.

1687088,A3VBXSV9WZIYTH,B00H9KKGTO,"Mr. Majestyk ""1126""","[0, 0]","I gotta jump in here.  There are so many negative reviews here.  &#34;It has no point.&#34;  &#34;It goes on too long!&#34;  &#34;It's like porn.&#34;  These are some of the film's criticisms.  And it's funny: these criticisms say more about the people who were watching the film than it does about the film at all.  Okay, fair enough: WofWSt. is a very dirty film, not for the faint of heart.  It is a movie about behavior, like so many other Martin Scorsese pictures.  More to the point, it is about BAD behavior.  If Goodfellas was the original, and Casino the sequel...well, I say Wolf is the third in a trilogy of Bad Behavior Films by Scorsese.  The same criticisms were leveled against Goodfellas at the time of its release--it's excessive, it's glamorizes the lifestyle and sets a bad example,etc.--but is now considered one of the best American films made.  Wolf probably won't live up to that expectation because it's not a pioneer the way Goodfellas was, but it's a wild and intense and funny ride, nevertheless.And for those of you who say there is no point, I couldn't disagree more.  Perhaps read this excerpt from Matt Zoller Seit's review.  Wolf is not a political movie, but is summed up rather nicely here, if not slightly in political terms:&#34;Men like Belfort (Dicaprio) represent us, even as they're robbing us blind. They're America, and on some level we must be OK with them representing America, otherwise we would have seen reforms in the late '80s or '90s or '00s that made it harder for men like Belfort to amass a fortune.... Belfort was never punished on a level befitting the magnitude of pain he inflicted. According to federal prosecutors, he failed to abide by the terms of his 2003 restitution agreement. He's a motivational speaker now, and if you read interviews with him, or his memoir, it's obvious that he's not really sorry about anything but getting caught. We laugh at the movie, but guys like Belfort will never stop laughing at us...&#34;&#34;We enable them by reveling in their exploits or not paying close enough attention to their misdeeds, much less demanding reform of the laws they bend or ignore&#8212;laws that might have teeth if we hadn't allowed guys like Belfort... to legally bribe the United States legislative branch via... campaign financing. After a certain number of decades, we should ask if the nonstop enabling of addicts like Belfort doesn't mean that, in some sense, their enablers are addicted, too&#8212;that they (we) are part of a perpetual-motion wheel that just keeps turning and turning. In the end &#34;Wolf&#34; is not so much about one addict as it is about America's addiction to capitalist excess ...&#34;",4,In Defense of This Film,1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,2686,"['got', 'ta', 'jump', 'here', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'here', '34', 'point.', '34', '34', 'too', 'long', '34', '34', 'porn.', '34', 'are', 'film', 'criticisms', 'funny', 'criticisms', 'say', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'watching', 'film', 'film', 'Okay', 'fair', 'enough', 'WofWSt', 'very', 'dirty', 'film', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'movie', 'behavior', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'pictures', 'More', 'point', 'BAD', 'behavior', 'Goodfellas', 'was', 'original', 'Casino', 'sequel', 'well', 'say', 'Wolf', 'third', 'trilogy', 'Bad', 'Behavior', 'Films', 'Scorsese', 'same', 'criticisms', 'were', 'leveled', 'Goodfellas', 'time', 'release', 'excessive', 'lifestyle', 'bad', 'example', 'etc.', 'now', 'considered', 'one', 'best', 'American', 'films', 'made', 'Wolf', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'expectation', 'not', 'pioneer', 'way', 'Goodfellas', 'was', 'wild', 'intense', 'funny', 'ride', 'nevertheless.And', 'who', 'say', 'point', 'could', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'more', 'Perhaps', 'read', 'excerpt', 'Matt', 'Zoller', 'Seit', 'review', 'Wolf', 'not', 'political', 'movie', 'summed', 'up', 'rather', 'nicely', 'here', 'not', 'slightly', 'political', 'terms', '34', 'Men', 'Belfort', 'Dicaprio', 'represent', 'even', ""'re"", 'robbing', 'blind', ""'re"", 'America', 'level', 'must', 'be', 'OK', 'representing', 'America', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'reforms', 'late', ""'80s"", ""'90s"", ""'00s"", 'made', 'harder', 'men', 'Belfort', 'amass', 'fortune', 'Belfort', 'was', 'never', 'punished', 'level', 'befitting', 'magnitude', 'pain', 'inflicted', 'According', 'federal', 'prosecutors', 'failed', 'abide', 'terms', '2003', 'restitution', 'agreement', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'now', 'read', 'interviews', 'memoir', 'obvious', 'not', 'really', 'sorry', 'anything', 'getting', 'caught', 'laugh', 'movie', 'guys', 'Belfort', 'will', 'never', 'stop', 'laughing', '34', '34', 'enable', 'reveling', 'exploits', 'not', 'paying', 'close', 'enough', 'attention', 'misdeeds', 'much', 'less', 'demanding', 'reform', 'laws', 'bend', 'ignore', '8212', 'laws', 'might', 'have', 'teeth', 'had', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'guys', 'Belfort', 'legally', 'bribe', 'United', 'States', 'legislative', 'branch', 'campaign', 'financing', 'certain', 'number', 'decades', 'should', 'ask', 'nonstop', 'enabling', 'addicts', 'Belfort', ""n't"", 'mean', 'sense', 'enablers', 'are', 'addicted', 'too', '8212', 'are', 'part', 'perpetual-motion', 'wheel', 'just', 'turning', 'turning', 'end', '34', 'Wolf', '34', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'addict', 'America', 'addiction', 'capitalist', 'excess', '34']",N/A

Our human desire for power. The Wolf finds a way to get it by taking shortcuts and cutting corners. As in real life, there is always a balancing force and the Wolf turns more into a mouse that is being chased by the FBI.It is great entertainment. I didn't give it a perfect score because it did seem too long of a movie. I remember checking the bar on the screen that colors in as the movie progresses and it was barely halfway.The pros are that the actress that plays Leonardo's wife is &#34;amazingly hot.&#34; There was something about her New York accent that just did it for me. I guess because she reminded me so much of a stripper that I once dated.Some parts of the film seemed redundant. The purchasing-of-hookers side kept getting re-introduced over and over, down to the 3 categories of hookers that they would get.Where &#34;Goodfellas&#34; felt somewhat more like a serious film to me, this one seemed comedic at times. I suppose because of actor Johan Hill who has been funny as hell in so many movies.This movie delivered in that I felt motivated after I watched it. It made me realize that life is like a game that we learn to play, but there are unseen rules, a karmic balancing act. We seek the roads that lead to quick wealth at the expense of others, and seemingly just as quickly we sink. There are unexpected surprises at every corner.

1687116,A16C1J5AW2CDRE,B00H9KKGTO,O Shepard,"[0, 2]","&#8216;Wolf of Wall Street&#8217; was one of the best films of 2013 and also one of the most difficult to watch. The film is a portrait of the excesses of the corporate life on Wall Street as exemplified by the life of Jordan Belfort and chronicles his humble beginnings as a naive stockbroker and takes us through his transformation as an unrepentant corporate vulture. Almost none of the characters portrayed shows any ethics or morality except the FBI Agent Patrick Denham portrayed by Kyle Chandler who at the end of film is shown riding the subway alone in obvious discomfort while Jordan Belfort, after a short stay in a luxurious prison with tennis courts, continues with his ability to acquire wealth.It is not hard to understand the difficulty in watching this film as expressed by comments here on Amazon. Almost all of the cast are either crooks or unethical idiiots who win big. Greed is good and highly profitable in the world of &#8216;Wolf of Wall Street&#8217;. The mostly male brokers win great rewards. They accumulating money, property, and hot babes, consume drugs, and curse frequently, while those who play by the rules end up with very little, not even the satisfaction of beng recognized as behaving honorably. The behavior portrayed is alpha male behavior of the corporate world at its worst. Scorcese&#8217;s intention is to satirize the world of financial greed, which, by all reports, is not exaggerated in this film. A key scene repeated several times is the grunt and chest thumping scene. You could have taken this directly out of Ridley Scott&#8217;s &#8220;Gladiator&#8217;.  A large room of white shirted men grunt and pound their chests to a camera positioned at a point of view in front and above them as if they are saluting an unseen emperor sitting on a podium. These are the modern warriors of the corporate world. The viewer watching these scenes should feel uncomfortable but I suspect that many do not.The film begins with Jordan Belfort (Leonard diCaprio) portraying a likeable newbie stockbroker working for Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey).  Hanna advises Belfort to use sex and drugs to succeed in business. Hanna also demonstrates to Belfort many of the key ideas of behaving like an &#8216;alpha wolf&#8217; such as chest pounding. Belfort soon loses his job but re-invents himself in the image of Hanna and succeeds in building a company that amasses millions by cheating the poorest of investors. Along the way, Belfort loses his wife, picks up a trophy wife, and make millions of dollars exploiting the poorest of investors. Belfort manages to escape justice by making deals with the authorities and turns on his fellow stockbrokers but then has an epiphany. He realizes that he must change his ways when he escapes sudden death when an aircraft blows up before his eyes.The plot is filled wth humorous satire and we often laugh at the screen portrayals of the main characters. We are also titulated by the sex, the drugs, Belforts successes,  and other excesses. It is an uncomfortable laugh for us, the viewer, that is mixed with our simultaneous admiration and attractiion to the terrible behavior we see before us on screen. Scorcese&#8217;s choice of picking diCaprio to play Belford was inspired. Audiences found him both likable and despicable at the same time. His cherub-like face and manner, like many TV huckster get-rich-quick spokesman, made him instantly appealing. Occassionaly, Belfort&#8217;s conscious finds its way out and peeks at us during the course of the film. However we are also shocked by his appalling treatment of his wives, and his excessive use of sex and drugs. He dresses well, has lots of sex with beautiful woman, and parties enough to put most of the rest of us into an early grave. His guilt sometimes is apparent in his glances. I beleive that it is the performance by diCaprio that parlty resulted in some professional critics, bothered by it, to criticize the film&#8217;s moral ambiguity.  I do not think that this ambiquity was accidental.Scorcese wants us to be seduced by the world of &#8216;Wolf of Wall Street&#8217;. The story of the film is told through the eyes of Jordan Belford.  Remember, the entire film is narrated by Belfort. This is his world. We are pushed to laugh at the antics on the screen even as we grimace with horror when we understand the criminality and bad behavior beneath it. We are pushed to admire this world of corporate greed, the world of the alpha male, and at the same time, feel guilty about our admiration. Some of us might actually get defensive if we see ourselves uncomfortably reflected in the characters in this drama. The victims of Belfort are hidden from us in the background. We are prompted to give little thought to the poor investors being scammed by Belfort.  This isn&#8217;t the story of the victims; this is the story of the winners. If this sounds familar, then you might remember Scorcese&#8217;s other film that is narrated by a criminal, &#8216;Goodfellas&#8217;. Scorcese uses the same technique here in plot narration. the difference is that whereas in &#8216;Goodfellas&#8217; the story is about professional crimminals, &#8216;Wolf of Wall Street&#8217; is about professional businessman. In &#8216;Goodfellas&#8217; we see the story through the eyes of a life-long criminal, a killer. In  &#8216;Wolf of Wall Street&#8217; we see the story through a white-collar criminal in the corrupt business world.FBI agent Patrick Denham is Belfort&#8217;s nemesis in the film.  Played by Kyle Chandler, Denham is the ethical and moral center of the film who devotes his life to bring Belfort to justice. We do not like Denham very much. He is portrayed in the film as a dull government policeman. Chandler&#8217;s unlikability is accented in the film by his droopy hangdog face and his permanent five-o&#8217;clock shadow. Denham is Belforts equal which is made clear in the confrontation between the two on the deck of Belfort&#8217;s yacht, one of the film&#8217;s  key scenes. A well dressed, well spoken Belfort is bested in a verbal duel with poorly dressed, dull agent Denham. A scene is also inserted at the end of the film in which Scorcese seems to be asking us who do we admire the most; successful Belfort or drab Denham?&#8220;Wolf of Wall Street&#8217; was not my favorite of the &#8216;best&#8217; films of 2013. I liked most of the others much better, especially &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217;, &#8216;Gravity&#8217;, and &#8216;Dallas Buyer&#8217;s Club&#8217;. However it is an excellent film. One of Scorcese&#8217;s best. I have not commented much on the hard &#8216;R&#8217; rating of this film or it&#8217;s length. I did not see this film in a theater which would have made seat time almost unbearable and I can understand that the hard &#8216;R&#8217; nature of the film turned many people off, but I hope that that any readers of my comments here will understand my perspectives. I see &#8216;Wolf of Wall Street&#8217; as a dismal portrayal of the Wall Street world of business just as &#8216;Goodfellas&#8217; was a dismal portrayal of the world of organized crime.  We are supposed to see beyond the glitter of Jordan Belford&#8217;s life and see the worthlessness beneath. Perhaps this film refects the real world of American business too much and viewers recognize themselves in the film and feel badly and retreat into denial. I remember reading long ago that professional crimminals who saw &#8216;Goodfellas&#8217; said that the characters were accurate portrayals and recognized themselves in the film.Fans of Scorcese will like this film despite it&#8217;s length. It is worth watching twice. Watch it and consider that the film is all about how you, the viewer, react to a critical portrayal of the American way of business.",4,The Wolf in All of Us,1397174400,"04 11,

1687126,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00H9KKGTO,Paul Allaer,"[2, 6]","&#34;The Wolf Of Robin Hood&#34; (2013 release; 179 min.) brings the Hollywood interpretation of the memoirs by Wall Street stock broker and trader Jordan Belfort. As the movie opens, Belfort (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is starting his career at a blue chip Wall Street firm. On his first day on the job, he is taken out to lunch by his boss (played by Matthew McConaughey, in a short (less than 10 min.) but memorable performance). Soon thereafter, Black Monday happens (Oct. 1987) and Belfort loses his job. It's not long before he finds a new job selling &#34;penny stocks&#34; in a low profile stockbroker firm on Long Island, and after he sees the money-winning ways of that, he and his buddy Donny (played by Jonah Hill) start their own firm called Stratton Oakmont, which soon becomes an upstart success (along with its hard-charging life style), to the chagrin of others on Wall Street. To tell you more of the plot might spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the fifth collaboration between DiCaprio and director Martin Scorsese, the previous one being 2010's Shutter Island. They are also co-producers of this movie. The  movie's 3 hour running time is, frankly, a bit of a challenge. In particular the first half of the movie is a bit too much repetitive (yes, we get it, these guys did a lot of sex and drugs). Things become far more interesting when things start going south for Belfort & Co. At one point, Forbes Magazine comes to do a profile, and upon its publication, Belfort is indignant of the less than flattering portrait, when the article terms him &#34;like a twisted Robin Hood, he steals from the rich to give to himself&#34;. The last hour of the movie is when it all comes together for us, the neutral viewer, as we finally become emotionally invested in Belfort and those around him, as they are desperately trying to hang on and stay ahead of the feds. Not surprisingly, the acting performances are generally stellar, none more so than from DiCaprio, whom we see  deliver yet another winning dramatic role (the highlight being one of the 'pep talks' he gives to the Stratton brokers before the Steven Madden IPO, when he exclaims that &#34;there is no nobility in poverty!&#34;. The other surprise is fairly newcomer Margot Robbie, an Australian actress, in the role of Naomi (Belfort's second wife). Also worth mentioning is the incredibly rich production, which is apparent in even the smallest details. Bottom line: having seen the trailer a couple of times in recent weeks, and knowing the quality of DiCaprio and Scorsese, I came into this with sky-high expectations. They were not met. No, this is not a 'poor' movie by any stretch, but neither is it the riveting &#34;Wall Street is bad&#34; drama that it could've been, although as already mentioned, the last hour thankfully makes up for this, at least partially.The movie opened here in Cincinnati for the Christmas holiday, and when we went to see it today in a late matinee, imagine my surprise how poorly attended this particular screening was (the movie theatre as a whole seemed to be bursting with people, but clearly they went elsewhere). Given the 3 hr. running time and the not always easy viewing, I would be surprised if this became a box office hit. That said, if you like DiCaprio or Scorsese, you'll still want to check this out, be it in the theatre, or on DVD/Blu-ray.",4,"3.5 stars...

Of course it&#8217;s gratuitous &#8211; this guy&#8217;s whole lifestyle was gratuitous. So it works.3. This movie is also an acidly funny satire on Wall Street.4. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Jordan, a money-hungry young man with more ambition than brains.5. Jordan hires his knucklehead weed dealer friends to start a small semi-legal stockbroker firm. As they get more successful, they get less legal.6. DiCaprio has always been an excellent actor &#8211; but this may be his best performance ever. And Jonah Hill is also great as the douchebag friend.7. Jordan&#8217;s schemes were complicated and hard to understand for us regular folk, but the movie does a good job of dumbing it down &#8211; mostly by telling us that all we need to know is that he&#8217;s doing really illegal things.8. The scene where Jordan overdoses on Quaaludes is a minor masterpiece of physical comedy and is one of the single best scenes of the year. I didn&#8217;t know DiCaprio had it in him.9.

It is about Jordan Belfort, a millionaire from the previous generation who believed that morality was a flexible thing that could be used to fit situations as they arise. However, The Wolf of Wall Street was released in 2013 for a generation that believes in a very specific, rigid definition of morality that mustn't ever be tainted. This is a good and bad thing, mostly bad if you're a white straight American male with more than a little bit of money like the main character of this film/book it was based on. Before anything must be said about the movie itself, it has to be addressed that people are outright refusing to separate the art from the artist, as people nowadays are apt to do. &#34;It glorifies bad behavior! Capitalism is wrong! How dare that nice young man Leo do ___ or say ___!&#34; If you watched a good third of this movie and came away with some of these thoughts, perhaps complaining about misogyny in a Rachel McAdams film is more your speed. This is a Martin Scorsese film. And man does it feel good to be able to say that again: &#34;...from the director of Taxi Driver and Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese...&#34;For the rest of us who wanted more than anything a return to good cinema, The Wolf of Wall Street is a sign that not all is lost in Hollywood. Expertly shot and cast with a smart script, equal parts topical and fantastical, based on a wild life either you'd never want to experience but can't look away from a car wreck or are seriously jealous of, complete with Scorsese's signatures - an absolutely terrific soundtrack, surprisingly good comedic performances from the leads, passionate Italian women yelling and hitting, and quotes you'll never get out of your head. If there's one thing Martin Scorsese's been able to do as a filmmaker that not a lot of other people can achieve, it's being able to tell a story in such a way that you want to know what happens next. Many other great movies rarely get that feeling just right: the feeling of being a kid, listening to an old man tell it like it used to be, and wanting to hear more because it genuinely interested you. People who gave this movie low ratings because of the unlikable characters obviously don't know what that feeling is like.

I understand it was cut by two hours from the original four. It could have been cut by at least another 30 minutes. It is one darned thing after another, but some of the action is so drawn out and repetitious that I lost interest at one point. The last 30 minutes picked up and carried the film.We meet Jordan Belfort on his first day on Wall Street. One of the traders, played by Matthew Mc Conaughey, takes him under his wing, and teaches him how to make millions. He also teaches him a crazy chest beating chant that Jordan Belfort carries with him throughout his life. He loses the job in the 1987 depression, but then starts up his own firm in Long Island and started making millions and millions of dollars. We are privy to his actions, his under the counter transactions, excessive lifestyle, booze, drugs and women. The Bacchanalian actions of the entire team are on display. Money, it seems, lends itself to every habit known to man.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort to perfection. Jonah Hill plays Donnie Azoff, one of the more unlikable men in the group - that man was without a conscience. Rob Reiner as Belfort's father tries to help his son stay on the straight and narrow. Many characters in this film, and most are as bad as the next. This is an entertaining film, but again, much too long.The sex, violence and drugs are what occurred during this time in the 80's and 90's. If you do not like sex, drugs, rock'n'roll and four letter words, forget this film. It is not for you. Martin Scorsese directed this film, and it is a good one, good not great. This film was taken from the book written by Jordan Belfort, who is not a fan of the film. It depicts him as the greedy, unlikable man he is. He is now on the speaker's circuit after spending a short time in prison.This is an entertaining, if not too long film. Funny at times, but sad at others.

In recent memory, only The Avengers comes to mind. But what makes The Wolf of Wall Street such a success is that it shows Martin Scorsese doing what he does best. He takes the tale of Jordan Belfort, an intelligent yet mischievous stockbroker who was very skilled at swindling stocks, manipulating the stockmmarket, and turns it into the cinematic equivalent of an injection of coke, meth, heroin, codeine, aderall and a number of uppers and downers- all at once. In other words, it's a crazy, wild ride. And if this were any other filmmaker, it wouldn't have turned out as well as it did, nor would I have been able to sit through it for two hours, let alone the three hours that The Wolf of Wall Street runs. But this is Scorsese, folks. His films are famous for effectively blending in substance and style in equal parts, and this film is no different at all.Perhaps the most memorable thing about The Wolf of Wall Street is, and face it, you saw this coming, Leo DiCaprio's performance. You probably already knew DiCaprio would give an amazing performance, but here he gives his best yet. He completely snaps into character and gives a bravura performance that's completely real. From the opening scenes alone, where he gives an almost Patrick Batemanesque introspective into his life and career, his cars, his home, his past time pleasures such as excessive drug use and drugged out chaos, sex with hookers and what have you, you're in the palm of his hand. The scenes where he talks to the camera about certain subjects is where you can see the amount of confidence he has bursting at the scenes. His David Tennant style delivery of his speeches to his staff at Stratton Oakmont just shows he was born to play this role. It's a tricky role to take on too, as his character is involved in tons of debauchrous situations; but the aforementioned confidence of DiCaprio is what keeps it believable.And in general, just how well the essence of the story is captured is unbelievable. The film runs a mammoth 3 hours, and is a lot to take in. However, it's so entertaining that you could sit and watch and be entertained if it ran an hour longer. In fact, I'm pretty amazed that they even fit this all in in three hours. A lot of things happen in the story, and they're all tremendous. In fact, direction wise, Scorsese's DNA is splashed all over this film too. The scene where Belfort is caught for his crimes mid-commercial filming is absolutely hilarious; the slow motion shots with narration about things such as how certain drugs work are charming, in a sort of filthy and debauchrous way too. There's funny scenes a- plenty, such as a long gag involving a high from an extreme drug made with lemon extract (how DiCaprio and Hill managed to hold it together in the face during these scenes is amazing, even). And the trademark &#34;Scorsese timing&#34;, where scenes are swiftly paced and smartly blocked is on full display as well. So it goes to say that Scorsese has made yet another substantial and directorial masterpiece.In short, The Wolf of Wall Street is without a doubt a late must-see and contender for &#34;best of the year&#34;. Of the last batch of movies to be released this year, this sure drew the year to a satisfying close, and we can only hope that this will get the academy awards it deserves. Do yourselves a favour too and see this on the big screen, with a packed audience.

The story has too many holes and things that don't follow the plot line.  Basically, it is a story of a corrupt wall street broker who gets caught.  Duhh!.  No tension in the movie.  Time is spend way too much with the partying and crazy acting.  The main character is way over the top in emotional responses and is more of a caricature than a believable person.Holes in the plot, like at the end, main character goes against his agreement with the Feds, so naturally they arrest him, then next scene he is at the trial saying how he gave up his people.  Well I thought he was going to jail because he broke his agreement, but all of a sudden the agreement is intact and off to jail he goes with a reduced sentence.  No connection here.Another one is showing his wife pregnant at one point and then next scene she is not?  The movie never mentions this 2nd child and when the main character says he wants his kids, he only grabs one?  Where is the 2nd one?  Really stupid editing and direction in this movie.So 3/4 of the movie is about his partying, not tension or conflicts.

In fact, it feels a bit like lazy filmmaking to me in that it basically strikes the same note over and over again (to the point of becoming totally tiresome).  What do I mean by that?  Well, the DiCaprio character basically drones on and on through voiceover about how great he is, then proclaims it to others (usually the traders who work for him), then celebrates his greatness through excessive use of drugs (or hookers combined with excessive use of drugs), and after he's come down from his high he involves himself in some sort of shady business endeavor, after which he gets high again, cohorts with hookers again, etc. etc.  It seems as if the entire film is basically constant repetition of the same plot template.  There's no in-depth examination of DiCaprio's character of the world he occupies - we just get the same tired repetition of the same shallow plot drivers over and over again.

While this doesn't quite live up to those previous films, it is nevertheless quite entertaining. The story follows the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort, who ran a brokerage firm, Stratton Oakmont, in the late 80's/early 90's. Along the way, he makes a ton of money and indulges his every whim, which was mostly a lot of drugs. A smaller part of the story is how he was taken down by the FBI, but the main draw is obviously Jordan. In his previous gangster/crime films, Scorsese provided the viewer with a window into how those criminal enterprises operate, and he does the same here with white collar crime. One thing which was extremely effective, yet detracts from the experience a little bit, was how Scorsese used cinematic technique and a frenetic editing style to convey the themes of excess, over-indulgence and greed. It makes logical sense that a film about a person like Jordan Belfort would be this stuffed, even if it does start to wear on the viewer after a while (as it certainly did me). Fortunately, there were some quieter moments, and scenes where a voice of reason could be heard, even if it was ultimately ignored. However, there should be something said about the end result. Unlike previous characters who were reduced to shells of their former selves, Jordan Belfort gets off fairly lightly. Sure, he goes to prison, but it's a cushy prison and he only has to serve a few years. Perhaps this is cynicism on Scorsese's part, and maybe it's emblematic of where our society has gone. Instead of the ultimately good-natured criminal who looks out for the interests of a family-like organization, we have greedy vultures who only look out for themselves, and by and large we let them take advantage of us in ways that are truly despicable. The film makes a point about not showing the victims of Jordan's crimes, but I didn't find this too disheartening. The movie is meant to revolve around Jordan and to give the viewer an experience which approaches what his life was like. Sure, parts of it are extremely funny, but underneath all of the humor lies a rather masochistic current. Excess will ruin you, and by the end of this you should feel disgusted at how people are treated (especially the women) and exhausted from the whirlwind ride you've just been taken on. Even though the film does become repetitive after a while, I wouldn't have wanted to be taken on this journey with anyone but Scorsese. It's not quite a masterpiece, or even top-tier Scorsese, but it's a film worth watching even if only once.",4,"My review of ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" (potential spoilers)",1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,2687,"['WOLF', 'OF', 'WALL', 'STREET', 'insanely', 'hyper-kinetic', 'wall-to-wall', 'sex', 'drug-taking', 'most', 'energetic', 'Scorsese', 'been', 'CASINO', 'GOODFELLAS', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'previous', 'films', 'nevertheless', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'story', 'rise', 'fall', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'who', 'ran', 'brokerage', 'firm', 'Stratton', 'Oakmont', 'late', ""80's/early"", '90', 'way', 'ton', 'money', 'whim', 'was', 'mostly', 'lot', 'drugs', 'smaller', 'part', 'story', 'how', 'was', 'taken', 'down', 'FBI', 'main', 'draw', 'obviously', 'Jordan', 'previous', 'gangster/crime', 'films', 'Scorsese', 'provided', 'viewer', 'window', 'how', 'criminal', 'enterprises', 'operate', 'same', 'here', 'white', 'collar', 'crime', 'One', 'thing', 'was', 'extremely', 'effective', 'yet', 'experience', 'little', 'bit', 'was', 'how', 'Scorsese', 'used', 'cinematic', 'technique', 'frenetic', 'editing', 'style', 'convey', 'themes', 'excess', 'over-indulgence', 'greed', 'logical', 'sense', 'film', 'person', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'would', 'be', 'stuffed', 'even', 'start', 'wear', 'viewer', 'while', 'certainly', 'did', 'Fortunately', 'were', 'quieter', 'moments', 'scenes', 'where', 'voice', 'reason', 'could', 'be', 'heard', 'even', 'was', 'ultimately', 'ignored', 'However', 'should', 'be', 'something', 'said', 'end', 'result', 'previous', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'reduced', 'shells', 'former', 'selves', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'off', 'fairly', 'lightly', 'Sure', 'prison', 'cushy', 'prison', 'only', 'serve', 'few', 'years', 'Perhaps', 'cynicism', 'Scorsese', 'part', 'maybe', 'emblematic', 'where', 'society', 'gone', 'Instead', 'ultimately', 'good-natured', 'criminal', 'who', 'out', 'interests', 'family-like', 'organization', 'have', 'greedy', 'vultures', 'who', 'only', 'look', 'out', 'large', 'let', 'take', 'advantage', 'ways', 'are', 'truly', 'despicable', 'film', 'point', 'not', 'showing', 'victims', 'Jordan', 'crimes', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'too', 'disheartening', 'movie', 'meant', 'revolve', 'Jordan', 'give', 'viewer', 'experience', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'Sure', 'parts', 'are', 'extremely', 'funny', 'humor', 'rather', 'masochistic', 'current', 'Excess', 'will', 'ruin', 'end', 'should', 'feel', 'disgusted', 'how', 'people', 'are', 'treated', 'especially', 'women', 'exhausted', 'whirlwind', 'ride', ""'ve"", 'just', 'been', 'taken', 'Even', 'film', 'become', 'repetitive', 'while', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'wanted', 'be', 'taken', 'journey', 'anyone', 'Scorsese', 'not', 'quite', 'masterpiece', 'even', 'top-tier', 'Scorsese', 'film', 'watching', 'even', 'only', 'once']",N/A

1687188,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B00H9KKGTO,Robin Friedman,"[4, 10]","Martin Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is loosely based on a memoir of the same name by Jordan BelfortThe Wolf of Wall Street (Movie Tie-in Edition), the main protagonist and the anti-hero of this movie portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. Terrence Winter turned Belfort's book into a highly effective screenplay. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" focuses upon the hard elements of American life, as do most Scorsese films. The cinematography is  stunning, and the movie holds the viewers attention through its three-hour length.As portrayed in the film, Belfort would be a wolf on any American or Scorsese street, including Wall Street. The movie focuses on raw greed, lust for power, sex, and drugs.  Belfort's unscrupulous greed has no bounds.  As the film opens, he is hired by a Wall Street brokerage firm, receives instructions in hustling from a colleague over a drug, alcohol filled lunch and must seek new employment when his firm closes on Wall Street's Black Friday. He soon secures a job hustling penny stocks and excels with his high pressure salesmanship. Then, with some marijuana -trading buddies, he opens his own brokerage house, with the establishment-sounding name of Stratton Oakmont. The fun and fraud truly begin, as Belfort attracts a crew of greedy salespeople, pursues many scams, and quickly becomes unconscionably rich. A hard-working, unpretentious FBI agent played by Kyle Chandler is soon on Belfort's case and ultimately brings about conviction, bar from the securities industry, large fine, and relatively short prison sentence.Besides the scenes of financial fraud, the movie is laced with profanity (including over 600 use of the --word, a record for a feature film), sex orgies, paid and otherwise, and drug use.  Belfort lived, to say the least, a high life of excess with a mansion, fancy cars, a large yacht, and money that required extensive laundering in a questionable Swiss bank. The film is sharply and sardonically funny.  It draws the viewer in to an immoral and hedonistic lifestyle, both in its portrayal of Belfort and its portrayal of his associates and his victims who are looking to get rich quick.The movie includes stunning scenes of a ship sinking at sea, of Belfort rousing his staff with charismatic sales speeches, and of Belfort in a drug-induced stupor driving and wrecking an expensive car on a short ride to his home. These are all separate from the many explicit scenes of sexuality, drinking, and carousing.The movie portrays a callow, vicious way of life shown by a man in a suit and tie in the United States' financial center. The portrayal is sharp.  Some viewers have complained that it glamorizes the life it shows, but I did not find it so.Many Scorsese films have religious overtones in that they hint of redemption for their deeply flawed protagonists. Belfort gets caught, but does not repent over the course of the movie. At the end, unchastened, he is shown pursuing a hustle similar to what he might have pursued at the beginning. He rejects opportunities to come clean and cooperate until literally forced to do so. There is no redemption in this movie. Rather, we have a raw, unchanged character who somehow attains an unwelcome and anti-heroic stature at the end for continuing to be who he is.Robin Friedman",5,A Wolf on any Street,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,3279,"['Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'loosely', 'based', 'memoir', 'same', 'name', 'Jordan', 'BelfortThe', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Movie', 'Tie-in', 'Edition', 'main', 'protagonist', 'anti-hero', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Terrence', 'Winter', 'turned', 'Belfort', 'book', 'highly', 'effective', 'screenplay', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'hard', 'elements', 'American', 'life', 'do', 'most', 'Scorsese', 'films', 'cinematography', 'stunning', 'movie', 'viewers', 'attention', 'three-hour', 'length.As', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Belfort', 'would', 'be', 'wolf', 'American', 'Scorsese', 'street', 'including', 'Wall', 'Street', 'movie', 'raw', 'greed', 'lust', 'power', 'sex', 'drugs', 'Belfort', 'unscrupulous', 'greed', 'bounds', 'film', 'hired', 'Wall', 'Street', 'brokerage', 'firm', 'instructions', 'hustling', 'colleague', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'filled', 'lunch', 'must', 'seek', 'new', 'employment', 'when', 'firm', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Black', 'Friday', 'soon', 'job', 'hustling', 'penny', 'stocks', 'excels', 'high', 'pressure', 'salesmanship', 'Then', 'marijuana', '-trading', 'buddies', 'own', 'brokerage', 'house', 'establishment-sounding', 'name', 'Stratton', 'Oakmont', 'fun', 'fraud', 'truly', 'begin', 'Belfort', 'crew', 'greedy', 'salespeople', 'many', 'scams', 'quickly', 'unconscionably', 'rich', 'hard-working', 'unpretentious', 'FBI', 'agent', 'played', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'soon', 'Belfort', 'case', 'ultimately', 'conviction', 'bar', 'securities', 'industry', 'large', 'fine', 'relatively', 'short', 'prison', 'scenes', 'financial', 'fraud', 'movie', 'laced', 'profanity', 'including', '600', 'use', 'word', 'record', 'feature', 'film', 'sex', 'orgies', 'paid', 'otherwise', 'drug', 'use', 'Belfort', 'lived', 'say', 'least', 'high', 'life', 'excess', 'mansion', 'fancy', 'cars', 'large', 'yacht', 'money', 'required', 'extensive', 'laundering', 'questionable', 'Swiss', 'bank', 'film', 'sharply', 'sardonically', 'funny', 'viewer', 'immoral', 'hedonistic', 'lifestyle', 'portrayal', 'Belfort', 'portrayal', 'associates', 'victims', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'get', 'rich', 'quick.The', 'movie', 'stunning', 'scenes', 'ship', 'sinking', 'sea', 'Belfort', 'rousing', 'staff', 'charismatic', 'sales', 'speeches', 'Belfort', 'drug-induced', 'stupor', 'driving', 'wrecking', 'expensive', 'car', 'short', 'ride', 'home', 'are', 'separate', 'many', 'explicit', 'scenes', 'sexuality', 'drinking', 'carousing.The', 'movie', 'callow', 'vicious', 'way', 'life', 'shown', 'man', 'suit', 'tie', 'United', 'States', 'financial', 'center', 'portrayal', 'sharp', 'viewers', 'have', 'complained', 'life', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'so.Many', 'Scorsese', 'films', 'have', 'religious', 'overtones', 'hint', 'redemption', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'protagonists', 'Belfort', 'caught', 'not', 'repent', 'course', 'movie', 'end', 'unchastened', 'shown', 'pursuing', 'hustle', 'similar', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'pursued', 'beginning', 'opportunities', 'come', 'clean', 'cooperate', 'literally', 'forced', 'do', 'so', 'redemption', 'movie', 'Rather', 'have', 'raw', 'unchanged', 'character', 'who', 'somehow', 'unwelcome', 'anti-heroic', 'stature', 'end', 'continuing', 'be', 'who', 'Friedman']",N/A

I'm not shocked often and I'd even heard the rumors about this movie, but still, I was surprised at the amount of porn-quality sex, F-bombs (sometimes 3x in 1 sentence!) and, mostly, the rampant usage of drugs. Lots and lots of drugs. No, not just an occasional joint but tons of coke everywhere (including being blown up a butt-hole) and even as boldly used in a crowded restaurant at the table. Hard to imagine millionaire success when everyone is so stoned all the time. Really? All in all, it WAS entertaining for all 3 hours (yes, a full 3-hour movie!). Matthew McC. does a great job for his scene-stealing restaurant ad-lib. Jonah Hill is priceless as DiCaprio's number one guy. This is NOT a movie to watch with your parents or your kids.

How can the portrayal of any life event be unnecessary?I have no ethical critique on this film.  DiCaprio stated the story was a cautionary tale.  I guess it can be looked at from a number of different angles.  Is it cautionary in the respect that excess and greed lead to a downfall?  I think that's what he meant.

They think that they're better than everyone else because they have more money and thus more access to a luxurious lifestyle, but as the characters in this film, especially Jordan Belfort, played with a wonderful intensity by Leonardo DiCaprio, soon find out, they're just as human as everyone else, and no amount of wealth can change them into anything more.By the end of the film, the cold hard reality hits them right where it hurts, and there's no going back. I'll admit, I did laugh a few times, but it wasn't nearly as funny as it tried to be. Mostly it was just cruel, vulgar, and offensive, and many of the characters actions are just as, if not more pathetic than those from the lower class of American society.

Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is...well, a DiCaprio performance. He's stunted and wooden as usual, though he executes the role pretty well nonetheless. Jonah Hill is a riot and I thought that the cinematography was pretty fantastic.That said, the run time is a bit too excessive, much like the characters of the film, and there are some drier portions.

In a way it is, but in a way it is something completely different.This is Scorsese's funniest film, and the funniest film of 2013. It has the wackiness of Scorsese's (massively underrated) After Hours, on a much larger scale, and the remorseless characters from other Scorsese films such as Goodfellas and The Departed. As a huge fan of Scorsese, I'd put this somewhere near the bottom of his top ten films (which is big for me).I also have to mention, this is Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance ever. He goes off the rails and gives a performance unlike anything that I've seen from him in the last 20 years. He also shows that he's a naturally gifted comedic actor, providing some of the funniest moments I've ever seen on a screen. The rest of the cast is fantastic as well, most notably Matthew McConaughey in an incredible 10 minutes. Jonah Hill further proves his acting chops, and showed great chemistry again with another mega-movie-star after his turn in Moneyball.Another thing I feel the need to mention, this film might not be for everyone. It's full of drugs, nudity, and foul language. It pushes the limits of an R-rating and doesn't look back. And another thing, it's 3 hours long. The length is no problem to me, and I think that the film flew by, but I've heard some people complain about it. Calling a film too long is the laziest criticism in the book in my opinion. Would you rather enjoy a very good movie for 2 hours, or 3 hours? I'll end my rant there, and tell you to go see The Wolf of Wall Street in theaters, buy the DVD, rent it, just find any way to watch it.The mere fact that the legendary Martin Scorsese, in 2013, at the age of 71 (!) can make a film like this is incredible, and it cannot be missed.",5,Will be mentioned among Scorsese's best.,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,1854,"['Terrence', 'Winter', 'adapted', 'Belfort', 'novel', 'clear', 'vision', 'mind', 'making', 'film', 'companion', 'piece', 'Goodfellas', 'way', 'way', 'something', 'completely', 'different.This', 'Scorsese', 'funniest', 'film', 'funniest', 'film', '2013', 'wackiness', 'Scorsese', 'massively', 'underrated', 'Hours', 'much', 'larger', 'scale', 'remorseless', 'characters', 'other', 'Scorsese', 'films', 'such', 'Goodfellas', 'Departed', 'huge', 'fan', 'Scorsese', ""'d"", 'put', 'somewhere', 'bottom', 'top', 'ten', 'films', 'big', '.I', 'also', 'have', 'mention', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'best', 'performance', 'ever', 'rails', 'performance', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'last', '20', 'years', 'also', 'naturally', 'gifted', 'comedic', 'actor', 'providing', 'funniest', 'moments', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'screen', 'rest', 'cast', 'fantastic', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'notably', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'incredible', '10', 'minutes', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'further', 'acting', 'chops', 'showed', 'great', 'chemistry', 'again', 'mega-movie-star', 'turn', 'Moneyball.Another', 'thing', 'feel', 'need', 'mention', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'full', 'drugs', 'nudity', 'foul', 'language', 'limits', 'R-rating', ""n't"", 'look', 'back', 'thing', '3', 'hours', 'long', 'length', 'problem', 'think', 'film', 'flew', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'people', 'complain', 'Calling', 'film', 'too', 'long', 'laziest', 'criticism', 'book', 'opinion', 'Would', 'rather', 'enjoy', 'very', 'good', 'movie', '2', 'hours', '3', 'hours', ""'ll"", 'end', 'rant', 'there', 'tell', 'go', 'see', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'theaters', 'buy', 'DVD', 'rent', 'just', 'find', 'way', 'watch', 'it.The', 'mere', 'fact', 'legendary', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', '2013', 'age', '71', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'incredible', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

1687243,A38X3820MO0TAN,B00H9KKGTO,Sony XL,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***.From the previews the movie looked promising enough. The way Scorsese's Goodfellas delved into the world of organized crime Wolf would do the same for corporate crime. A movie which would give us a point of view of the criminal activity in Wall street with some depravity in between. But instead we get the opposite. The sex and drug-use is the focus with barely a semblance of a story wedged in between. There is a fine line between cautionary tale and glorification of bad behavior and Scorsese crosses it.As it appears in a desperate attempt to combine every R-rated movie trope into one movie he has made a movie with nothing new to offer. Are you looking for offensive comedy that crosses the line and actually makes you laugh watch Ted, Or a movie with strong language that serves the plot watch Django Unchained. Maybe closer to your taste is a movie that deals with drug-use and a diabolical maniac watch Scarface or Clockwork Orange. How about gratuitous sex and nudity with at least a half-decent script watch HBO. In Scorsese's attempt to produce the most controversial, shocking movie of the decade, he has missed the essence of what makes these movies good. Characters that appear every bit as human as the viewer except for their perversions. Even Tony Montana bears more humanity than Belfort. You know the people he kills are shady characters to begin with and towards the end he calls off an attack that would have endangered a target's wife and child. This doesn't serve to make us sympathize with him but to ground the character in the real world.In Wolf, we are fed the same drug and sex fueled debauchery over and over again until it becomes dizzying so that any message the movie is trying to send drifts over your head. What Scorsese could have easily achieved with a hammer he opts for a Wrecking ball leaving any meaning obliterated and untraceable. If I wanted to binge on 3 hours of porn with one-dimensional characters I would stay at home and watch it free, not pay upwards of $7 to watch it in the midst of 50 strangers in a darkened theater. A caricature of a caricature. This same movie directed by Michael Bay would have been panned by the critics. But the ""Scorsese knows no wrong"" crowd is more that willing to dole out praise. They will criticize Bay for cartoonish characters and crass humor but no not this movie.The movie attempts to be a reflection of Western society today and it's obsession with wealth. Instead, it is more accurately a reflection of the director. Just like Belfort we lured into the promise of a something of value - here a dramatic piece - and we're left reeling from the aftermath not unlike Belfort's victims. He pockets millions of dollars regardless of whether the movie bombs or not. I fashion to guess that the reality is the work of art itself and was his plan from the beginning - his grandest piece of all. Except I would have to admit that he was capable of such a grandiose scheme. Most likely he is oblivious he is the very image of the what he tries to satires in this movie.I wanted to love this movie so bad. From DiCaprios over the top acting - he doesn't let any chance to scream at the top of his lungs slip - to the sex and drug-use which I have no qualms with except for it being excruciatingly slammed into you head until you've become as mindless as the plot I can't pretend I enjoyed this nauseating experience.

1687247,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B00H9KKGTO,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[2, 4]","saw way more of this character's sex life than interested me. after you've seen one or two orgies in this story, the fifth or sixth is like, whatever, especially as the scenes are not filmed erotically but, I guess the word would be, basely, with no finesse, showing the male characters basically rutting with sex workers. as some of the leads are married, you get guys who are cheating on their wives, who are scumbag liars out to rob unsuspecting working class people, and who are drug fiends. extremely unappealing. why give me characters I cannot like, respect, identify with or care about and who I'd avoid in real life? am I supposed to be entertained by or learn something from their antics? is this anti-wall street propaganda?greedy, dumb anti-hero. it's not just that he's a liar, a thief and a junkie, he's a stereotypical liar, thief and junkie. he wants to make money, okay; he's not ethical and will do whatever he feels he needs to to make a buck, fine, if that's the character you want to present. but there is nothing interesting about him, and I mean nothing. the writer brings nothing new to this type of character. writer softens him abit by presenting his parents though you don't get to know his mother. the character respects his father alittle, at least he tries to hide some of his worse lies and excesses from him, and he doesn't do drugs with his parents or in front of them, thank god, but if I had a son like him, I'd have read him the riot act. his father tries to but the character is apparently so rich he will listen to or respect no one.this young guy wants what he wants and doesn't care who he hurts to get it. the writer shows him cheating and divorcing his first wife and marrying the slender, pretty, young blond. the writer protects him somewhat by largely not showing the pain he inflicts on others: we see his first wife's anger as she hits him, but the story doesn't linger on her pain and we really don't see her suffering. additionally, the people he cheats and lies to in business are not shown. by not showing his victims the writer makes him tolerable, barely.he demonstrates his stupidity by dumping his ethical, caring, though apparently sexually boring (in his opinion) first wife (he has plenty of comparisons as he spends his free time cheating on her with as many sex workers as he can). he leaves her for the beautiful blond who invites him to have sex with her though she knows he's married and whose invitation he accepts, believably (given his history in the film). he also proves his stupidity by smoking crack for no reason except that some guy he barely knew invited him to. basically, he's a risk taker and seems nearly out of control, caring only about making money and sex. again, why we are saddled with such an extreme character, or why we should care about him or what we are to learn from him, is beyond me.the main character routinely says that what he is doing in business is illegal and yet seems to have no concern at all that he will get busted or go to prison, which may say something about how our policing system is viewed by a certain class of society.the lead male characters seem to be at one long frat party, though they're pushing 40. the amount of drugs they take should've had them down for a sting within the first hour. they are so over the top, the film resembles a cartoon and becomes very difficult to take seriously; I started laughing, their behavior is so unbelievable. it's not that this behavior couldn't happen in real life, I know there are some very rich, very indulged people: the problem is the writer didn't know how to present them believably.when researching excesses of wealthy, young businessmen, it doesn't work story-wise to take examples of bizarre behavior, say for example, launching midgets at a bulls eye, and simply plop that behavior into a film. average people won't be able to identify and therefore won't accept it, no matter how many staff meetings the lying, crooks take to discuss it. after all, we've already learned not to trust them. instead show something like the midgets coming to work that day, show them grumbling about these rich jerks paying them to do such degrading work, show one having a conversation with a wife saying he got a well paying gig and will be able to pay the mortgage tomorrow - anything that will help the audience believe that there is a business where the workers throw midgets at a bulls eye. to help us accept outrageous behavior, the writer needs to show us the world that surrounds these louts, how they in fact live, survive, and thrive in their crazy reality. we need to see the real world surrounding them, a world of getting kids up in the morning for pre-school or elementary school, getting pulled over by a traffic cop, i.e., mundane, real world events. the writer focuses so much on the wall street world that he/she forgets to create a believable reality in which these businessmen exist and apparently thrive, a reality the audience can recognize, as most of us cannot relate to the rich, drug-fueled world the leads live in.predictable, very American type of film as the bad guys get their comeuppance, but real villains escape justice all the time so not really believable these guys are taken down, though very believable that the lead serves so little time and keeps his money. surprising though given that he keeps his money that he loses his pretty wife. she's written as not much better than he so more believable that she'd have stayed with the money: kind of fake Hollywoody punishment that she left him.what I didn't understand is, how does a junkie like this character hold on to his wealth with so many other predators running around? I know some alcoholics can function in business but this guy was into most everything except heroin. in real life wouldn't he have crashed and burned from all the drugs and excesses and people taking advantage of his many stupors? I know very little about drugs, but this character was taking alot of stuff, nothing prescribed, and though young, it would've been more believable had he overdosed.the actors look to be having a good time playing such out of control, high risk taking characters, but they seem more like stereotypes than fully realized characters, more like rutting buffoons, so not really possible to learn anything from their misadventures. acting is okay. men might enjoy this story more than women, can't really see much here for women. his first wife is only in maybe 20 or so minutes of this very long seeming film, and the story doesn't focus on having audience connect with her, so when her ex-husband goes to prison, it's not like women are saying ""it great he got arrested."" I kept thinking he must have had constant STDs and his first and second wives must have had continuing yeast infections, and worse.being generous, I'd assess the film as worth a view (though it is overly long) if you like the actors/director, which I do.Hollywood continues to revisit this type of character but I've yet to see it done to my satisfaction: a wall streeter who is greedy and amoral, but who you understand and care about, despite yourself. a character who makes mistakes, pays for them, but the writing is so fine that it is a believable comeuppance that is of value to the character, and to the audience. in other words, a character who is of actual use to the audience, instead of a mere parody.P.S. This story could be read as a cautionary tale but a facsimile of the wall street as presented here might have existed in the 20th century. now, my feeling is, though I could be wrong, with so much world economic difficulty, harder to imagine stock brokers of the type presented here are common. maybe in the 1970s, 80s, maybe even up to the 2008 recession, but not now, and not for some time. also, this excess may have been in the entertainment industry. there are of course still very rich people, but I think even rich people are more cautious and poor people, well, we're poorer.",2,raunchy and excessive sex scenes do not satisfactorily update this story of an amoral wall streeter  (SPOILERS)...,1398816000,"04 30, 2014",2014,8010,"['saw', 'way', 'more', 'character',

1687252,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B00H9KKGTO,Steven Aldersley,"[13, 26]","Martin Scorsese's last movie was the family-friendly Hugo, so I guess he felt the need to make something a little more controversial this time around. The Wolf of Wall Street is bold, loud, and a totally wild ride for three hours. There are more than 500 F-bombs, sex, plenty of nudity, drugs everywhere, and even a little violence.Like Goodfellas, the movie uses voice-overs to give the audience an insight into how the characters think. We learn that Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) made $49 million when he was 26-years-old, but he's annoyed that it was $3 million short of a million per week. The story is non-linear, so we can also see how Belfort started in the business as a stockbroker, and the events that led to him owning his own company.Belfort's initial job is terminated, and for a short while he's desperate for work. But then he takes a chance on a small local firm which claims to be in the same business as his previous company. When he arrives, the employees are sitting around in jeans. There are no computers of any kind. The stocks being traded are only worth a few cents, but the rate of commission is 50 percent. In a very convincing scene, Belfort's character makes a $4,000 sale, earning him $2,000 on the spot. The other employees can't believe what they are seeing.This initial success enables Belfort to buy a fancy car and he attracts the attention of his neighbor, Donnie (Jonah Hill). After learning that Belfort made $72,000 the previous month, Donnie begs him for a job and quits his own immediately. Belfort is gifted at sales and convincing people to do things his way, He hires a collection of apparent losers, writes sales scripts, and teaches them how to sell. These scenes are very funny, and the whole venture succeeds brilliantly. Belfort is beginning to think anything is possible.The movie will appeal to a large number of people because Belfort essentially has the life that others dream about. He does and says what he wants, marries a beautiful woman, lives in a huge house, and buys just about anything his heart desires. He speculates to his employees that we all want such wealth, and let's face it, the vast majority of people dream of that kind of life.Some of the dialogue is excellent. For instance, one scene shows Belfort taking advice on dwarf tossing. He has a perfectly serious conversation about the legality of the idea, and wants to know the extent of his liabilities. Because it's serious, it's funny. One of the biggest laughs comes when we see a scene from Belfort's persepective and later learn the truth about what really happened. If you see the movie, you'll know which one I am talking about. The heavy drug use does cast some doubts about the accuracy of what we are seeing as it's mostly from Belfort's perspective.In rather predictable fashion, these largely illegal practices eventually catch up with him. However, I won't spoil the outcome by talking about how he deals with his problems.DiCaprio is outrageous for much of the movie. At times I thought I was watching Jack Nicholson around 40 years ago. If you recall Nicholson's performances in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest or The Shining, the manic quality is similar to DiCaprio's turn as Belfort. If you aren't squeamish about nudity and bad language, The Wolf of Wall Street is a lot of fun. It felt as if 90 minutes had gone by when the credits rolled, but it was three hours. I can imagine watching this one over and over.Overall score 4.5/5",5,Three hours felt like 90 minutes,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,3479,"['Martin', 'Scorsese', 'last', 'movie', 'was', 'family-friendly', 'Hugo', 'guess', 'felt', 'need', 'make', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'controversial', 'time', 'around', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'bold', 'loud', 'totally', 'wild', 'ride', 'three', 'hours', 'are', 'more', '500', 'F-bombs', 'sex', 'plenty', 'nudity', 'drugs', 'everywhere', 'even', 'little', 'violence.Like', 'Goodfellas', 'movie', 'voice-overs', 'give', 'audience', 'insight', 'how', 'characters', 'think', 'learn', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'made', '49', 'million', 'when', 'was', '26-years-old', 'annoyed', 'was', '3', 'million', 'short', 'million', 'week', 'story', 'non-linear', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'Belfort', 'started', 'business', 'stockbroker', 'events', 'led', 'owning', 'own', 'company.Belfort', 'initial', 'job', 'terminated', 'short', 'desperate', 'work', 'then', 'chance', 'small', 'local', 'firm', 'be', 'same', 'business', 'previous', 'company', 'When', 'employees', 'are', 'sitting', 'jeans', 'are', 'computers', 'kind', 'stocks', 'being', 'traded', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'cents', 'rate', 'commission', '50', 'percent', 'very', 'convincing', 'scene', 'Belfort', 'character', '4,000', 'sale', 'earning', '2,000', 'spot', 'other', 'employees', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'are', 'seeing.This', 'initial', 'success', 'Belfort', 'buy', 'fancy', 'car', 'attention', 'neighbor', 'Donnie', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'learning', 'Belfort', 'made', '72,000', 'previous', 'month', 'Donnie', 'job', 'own', 'immediately', 'Belfort', 'gifted', 'sales', 'convincing', 'people', 'do', 'things', 'way', 'collection', 'apparent', 'losers', 'sales', 'scripts', 'how', 'sell', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'whole', 'venture', 'brilliantly', 'Belfort', 'beginning', 'think', 'anything', 'possible.The', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'large', 'number', 'people', 'Belfort', 'essentially', 'life', 'others', 'dream', 'what', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'huge', 'house', 'just', 'anything', 'heart', 'employees', 'want', 'such', 'wealth', 'let', 'face', 'vast', 'majority', 'people', 'dream', 'kind', 'life.Some', 'dialogue', 'excellent', 'instance', 'one', 'scene', 'Belfort', 'taking', 'advice', 'dwarf', 'tossing', 'perfectly', 'serious', 'conversation', 'legality', 'idea', 'know', 'extent', 'liabilities', 'serious', 'funny', 'One', 'biggest', 'laughs', 'when', 'see', 'scene', 'Belfort', 'persepective', 'later', 'learn', 'truth', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'see', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'know', 'one', 'am', 'talking', 'heavy', 'drug', 'use', 'cast', 'doubts', 'accuracy', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'mostly', 'Belfort', 'perspective.In', 'rather', 'predictable', 'fashion', 'largely', 'illegal', 'practices', 'eventually', 'catch', 'up', 'However', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'outcome', 'talking', 'how', 'problems.DiCaprio', 'outrageous', 'much', 'movie', 'times', 'thought', 'was', 'watching', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'recall', 'Nicholson', 'performances', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'Shining', 'manic', 'quality', 'similar', 'DiCaprio', 'turn', 'Belfort', 'are', ""n't"", 'squeamish', 'nudity', 'bad', 'language', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'lot', 'fun', 'felt', '90', 'minutes', 'had', 'gone', 'when', 'credits', 'rolled', 'was', 'three', 'hours', 'can', 'imagine', 'watching', 'one', 'over', 'over.Overall', 'score', '4.5/5']",N/A

1687255,A26MJME9IBNETY,B00H9KKGTO,StrangePegs,"[12, 23]","There are, occasionally, those movies that come along where the best response I can generate for them is, &#34;Well, that was interesting.&#34; The Wolf of Wall Street is one of those movies.It's not a bad movie--certainly, the performances are great--but I can't say that it was a good movie, either. It... well, it just was.I suppose the main issue I have with it is that I'm not sure what the movie was trying to say. What it was about. Sure, the movie is about Jordan Belfort, but, usually, when you make a movie about someone's life, it's because you think there is a message people can take away from the story about that person's life. For instance:12 Years a Slave: Survive. Plus, you know, slavery is bad.Dallas Buyers Club: Don't succumb to the system if the system is wrong. Plus, you know, rich, white men don't care about anything other than taking your money from you.Saving Mr. Banks: Creation is a personal act and the creation remains a part of the creator. As Walt said about Mickey, &#34;He's family.&#34;Those are just some of the ones from this year. But I don't get a sense that there is any real message in Wolf. No underlying theme. Maybe the movie is just too chaotic for that. At any rate, I didn't feel like I came away with anything at the end of the movie other than Belfort was really screwed up.All of the characters are screwed up. Or too flat to be screwed up. Like Belfort's first wife; she's not screwed up, not in the movie, anyway, but we never see her as anything other than this background character that is mistreated. And the FBI guy doesn't seem to be screwed up, but he's &#34;FBI Guy&#34; and can't be screwed up, because that's his cutout. The rest of the characters are just screwed up.Also, I'm pretty sure it's not just me that has an issue with discerning a meaning in this movie. Well, my wife didn't see one, either. But! In doing my research, I found a reviewer who went to see this in a theater full of the kind of financial guys that Belfort was. They certainly saw the movie differently from me as the reviewer said they cheered &#34;in all the wrong places.&#34; When Belfort would do something bad (like when, after he's sober, he rips up his couch to get at his hidden stash of drugs), the guys in the theater would cheer for him. I take that to mean that there is no clear message in the movie, because, if there was, those people would not be cheering.But maybe Scorsese did it that way on purpose? Maybe he's just presenting the story of the man's life and letting people come away with their own message? Certainly, the actors (DiCaprio and Hill) have taken a lot of flak over their portrayals (which I just don't get; why is Scorsese not taking any heat over it? He's the one that presented it the way it is), that they were glorifying the drug use and partying and, well, everything that they do in the movie. I can understand why some people might think that the movie is an endorsement of that behavior. The problem is that you just can't tell.Not to mention that the movie resorts to that starting in the middle of the action thing and then jumps back to the beginning. For no purpose, evidently, other than to start with dwarf tossing. Why? It doesn't make the story better. It serves no purpose within the story. Why does everyone and their dog feel like you have to start somewhere in the middle and then go back to the beginning to explain whatever weirdness you're seeing? It's a cheap trick, and I'm so tired of it.There's also that the movie is three hours long. Three hours long of wondering what the point is to get to the end to find out that there was no point. Granted, it was a quick three hours due to the frenetic pace of the movie, but not really a satisfying three hours. And it was three hours after being cut down for being too long. It makes me wonder what they took out.Anyway... I'm actually disappointed that this movie has received a best picture nomination and that Scorsese has received a best director nomination. I suppose I can't fault them for the best actor and supporting actor nominations, because they did deliver great performances, although, as my wife pointed out, the character of Belfort has become DiCaprio's norm, so it wasn't a stretch for him. There's not a great chance he'll win, anyway, so I can live with the nomination.In the end, I think what's happening with this movie is what happens with any movie like this that critics can't figure out: Instead of just saying they don't know, they say it's great. That way they mask their ignorance. Personally, I think Scorsese missed with this one and everyone is too afraid to say so.",3,That Was Interesting,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,4643,"['are', 'occasionally', 'movies', 'come', 'along', 'where', 'best', 'response', 'can', 'generate', '34', 'Well', 'was', 'interesting.', '34', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'one', 'movies.It', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'certainly', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'either', 'well', 'just', 'was.I', 'suppose', 'main', 'issue', 'have', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'What', 'was', 'about', 'Sure', 'movie', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'usually', 'when', 'make', 'movie', 'someone', 'life', 'think', 'message', 'people', 'can', 'take', 'away', 'story', 'person', 'life', 'instance:12', 'Years', 'Slave', 'Survive', 'know', 'slavery', 'bad.Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', 'Do', ""n't"", 'succumb', 'system', 'system', 'wrong', 'know', 'rich', 'white', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'anything', 'other', 'taking', 'money', 'you.Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'Creation', 'personal', 'act', 'creation', 'part', 'creator', 'Walt', 'said', 'Mickey', '34', 'family.', '34', 'are', 'just', 'ones', 'year', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'real', 'message', 'Wolf', 'No', 'underlying', 'theme', 'Maybe', 'movie', 'just', 'too', 'chaotic', 'rate', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'came', 'away', 'anything', 'end', 'movie', 'other', 'Belfort', 'was', 'really', 'screwed', 'up.All', 'characters', 'are', 'screwed', 'up', 'too', 'flat', 'be', 'screwed', 'up', 'Belfort', 'first', 'wife', 'not', 'screwed', 'up', 'not', 'movie', 'anyway', 'never', 'see', 'anything', 'other', 'background', 'character', 'mistreated', 'FBI', 'guy', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'screwed', 'up', '34', 'FBI', 'Guy', '34', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'screwed', 'up', 'cutout', 'rest', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'screwed', 'up.Also', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'not', 'just', 'issue', 'discerning', 'meaning', 'movie', 'Well', 'wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'either', 'doing', 'research', 'found', 'reviewer', 'who', 'went', 'see', 'theater', 'full', 'kind', 'financial', 'guys', 'Belfort', 'was', 'certainly', 'saw', 'movie', 'differently', 'reviewer', 'said', 'cheered', '34', 'wrong', 'places.', '34', 'When', 'Belfort', 'would', 'do', 'something', 'bad', 'when', 'sober', 'up', 'couch', 'get', 'hidden', 'stash', 'drugs', 'guys', 'theater', 'would', 'cheer', 'take', 'mean', 'clear', 'message', 'movie', 'was', 'people', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'cheering.But', 'maybe', 'Scorsese', 'did', 'way', 'purpose', 'Maybe', 'just', 'presenting', 'story', 'man', 'life', 'letting', 'people', 'come', 'away', 'own', 'message', 'Certainly', 'actors', 'DiCaprio', 'Hill', 'have', 'taken', 'lot', 'flak', 'portrayals', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'Scorsese', 'not', 'taking', 'heat', 'one', 'presented', 'way', 'were', 'glorifying', 'drug', 'use', 'partying', 'well', 'everything', 'do', 'movie', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'might', 'think', 'movie', 'endorsement', 'behavior', 'problem', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell.Not', 'mention', 'movie', 'starting', 'middle', 'action', 'thing', 'then', 'back', 'beginning', 'purpose', 'evidently', 'other', 'start', 'dwarf', 'tossing', 'Why', ""n't"", 'make', 'story', 'better', 'purpose', 'story', 'Why', 'everyone', 'dog', 'feel', 'have', 'start', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'beginning', 'explain', 'weirdness', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'cheap', 'trick', ""'m"", 'so', 'tired', 'it.There', 'also', 'movie', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'Three', 'hours', 'long', 'wondering', 'what', 'point', 'get', 'end', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'point', 'Granted', 'was', 'quick', 'three', 'hours', 'due', 'frenetic', 'pace', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'satisfying', 'three', 'hours', 'was', 'three', 'hours', 'being', 'cut', 'down', 'being', 'too', 'long', 'wonder', 'what', 'took', 'out.Anyway', ""'m"", 'actually', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'received', 'best', 'picture', 'nomination', 'Scorsese', 'received', 'best', 'director', 'nomination', 'suppose', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'best', 'actor', 'supporting', 'actor', 'nominations', 'did', 'deliver', 'great', 'performances', 'wife', 'pointed', 'out', 'character', 'Belfort', 'become', 'DiCaprio', 'norm', 'was', ""n't"", 'stretch', 'not', 'great', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'win', 'anyway', 'can', 'live', 'nomination.In', 'end', 'think', 'what', 'happening', 'movie', 'what', 'movie', 'critics', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'Instead', 'just', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'say', 'great', 'way', 'mask', 'ignorance', 'Personally', 'think', 'Scorsese', 'missed', 'one', 'everyone', 'too', 'afraid', 'say', 'so']",N/A

1687279,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B00H9KKGTO,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[2, 3]","&#8220;The Wolf of Wall Street&#8221; is a major studio film with an A-list star and an A-list director. It also contains some exceptional supporting performances and an ambitious screenplay. Its positioning as a late- December, 2013 release indicates that the industry regards it as an Important Film. Yet its very sense of self-importance and a bloated running time make it an example of the excess it depicts.Jordan Belfort (Leonardo Di Caprio) works his way up to become a stockbroker on Wall Street. His first day in that position coincides with the 1987 crash of the market and he&#8217;s soon out of a job. When he finally gets another, it&#8217;s in a strip mall office staffed by guys who look more like bookies than stockbrokers. They sell junk stocks that pay huge commissions, often as high as 50% of the sale price. Jordan quickly makes a fortune in commissions by talking average, middle-class folks into buying crummy stocks, all perfectly legal.But Jordan is not satisfied. He covets as clients the rich, who have far more money to invest but are not as easy to sell. So Jordan develops a system to gradually build up their confidence by making them some money with blue chip stocks before pushing the junk. Along the way, he meets Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), a guy eager to get rich no matter the means, and together they create a mini-empire of brokers all determined to reap financial rewards with little concern for their clients&#8217; interests.Director Martin Scorsese and Di Caprio team up for the fifth time in this movie, based on the memoir of Long Island penny stockbroker Jordan Belfort. Di Caprio has always shone in pictures helmed by Scorsese and this is no exception. Belfort is the smooth-talking, good-looking fellow who is so rich he lights cigars with hundred dollar bills. As in his previous role in &#8220;The Great Gatsby,&#8221; DiCaprio embodies the charm that is the cornerstone to his character&#8217;s building a fortune, first legally and then in shadier fashion. Belfort and his crew are making money so fast that there need be no limit to their hedonsim, whether it involves call girls, cocaine, exotic sports cars, or yachts. They can have whatever money can buy.As Donnie, Jonah Hill continues to rack up an impressive series of sidekick roles, including the statistics expert in &#8220;Moneyball&#8221; and Chaning Tatum&#8217;s undercover partner in &#8220;21 Jump Street.&#8221; Hill started in broad comedies and while he uses his comic talents to advantage in the role of Donnie, his performance is a true characterization, transcending caricature, and makes for an interesting contrast to DiCaprio&#8217;s Belfort.The supporting cast adds to the film&#8217;s luster. Matthew McConaughey has a brief scene as Belfort&#8217;s mentor, a man with a rather distinctive playbook for success. Rod Reiner plays Belfort&#8217;s father, Jean Dujardin (&#8220;The Artist&#8221;) plays a crooked Swiss banker, Kyle Chandler is a persistent FBI agent who sets his sights on nailing Belfort, and Joanna Lumley takes on the key role of Aunt Emma, who becomes crucial in hiding huge sums of money from the government.There is a major problem with the film, however, and it is that Scorsese goes overboard in illustrating Belfort and company&#8217;s unbridled lifestyle, to the point of repetition. Long after we get the point, the director is hitting us over the head with yet another example of moral decay. Scorsese may have intended to underscore his characters&#8217; growing decadence, but the ultimate effect is to make us impatient with all this extravagance. There are moments when it even seems as if the actors are awaiting the &#8220;Cut&#8221; cue and are nervously carrying on with a scene that should have ended far sooner. It&#8217;s surprising that these scenes weren&#8217;t trimmed in the editing process, when a movie is given its final shape and pace.The atmosphere of Scorsese&#8217;s films is always significant, and the director does an excellent job recreating the excitement of Wall Street in the 80&#8217;s and 90&#8217;s with its conspicuous consumption, disdain of moderation, and feeling of invulnerability. The Bernie Madoff case comes to mind, since both Madoff and Belfort became hugely wealthy at the expense of those they duped by winning their confidence.Rated R, &#8220;The Wolf of Wall Street&#8221; is a cautionary tale of the power of money to corrupt and the ability of the corrupted to rationalize their immoral and illegal activities. Despite its excesses, it keeps us involved as we accompany Jordan Belfort on his drug-fueled roller-coaster ride.Bonus extras on the 2-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack includes the special feature &#8220;The Wolf Pack&#8221;

1687280,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B00H9KKGTO,The People's Critic,"[1, 8]","In 1986, a young People&#8217;s Critic was playing with his Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures, reading Spiderman comics, and watching Knight Rider; meanwhile The Wolf of Wall Street suggests that there was an entirely different story of the 1980s to tell.  Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio collaborate for the fifth time and the result is their most polarizing effort by far, but also DiCaprio&#8217;s greatest performance of his career.Last year at this exact time, I made quite a bit of noise about Leonardo DiCaprio&#8217;s sneaky but brilliant performance as Calvin Candie in Quentin Tarantino&#8217;s Django Unchained.  This year, I will make even more noise about his turn as Wall Street stockbroker, Jordan Belfort.  The film depicts the rise and inevitable fall of Belfort after he gets a taste of what the high life is like and never stops wanting more.That &#8220;taste&#8221; comes in the form of an early scene in the film.  In it, Belfort the nave intern meets the senior partner of his firm (Matthew McConaughey) for lunch.  Here Belfort is seemingly learning the ropes from a guy who&#8217;s been around for a while, but on second look Belfort is actually staring his future self right in the face.  McConaughey fiercely and skillfully poisons and corrupts Belfort but leaves him dazzled and impressed.  He sells Belfort just like another client, setting the wheels in motion for the &#8220;wolf&#8221; to rear its head.  When his brokerage closes after Black Monday in 1987, Belfort recruits a band of like-minded sleezeballs and opens his own brokerage firm called Stratton-Oakmont.  With consciences checked at the door and a script of Belfort&#8217;s own design, Stratton Oakmont prays on the rich and the poor, selling worthless &#8220;penny stocks&#8221; and reaping commissions hand over fist.  Belfort&#8217;s partner in crime, Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), represents the &#8220;Greed is good&#8221; adage from Wall Street to precision.  Together the two cut a swath through the financial market and find themselves absurdly wealthy and yet impossibly insatiable. Balfort symbolically leaves stability behind when he leaves his  kind and caring wife, Teresa (Cristin Milioti) for sexpot, Naomi (Margot Robbie).While clearly a Scorsese film, the director&#8217;s presence from a technical standpoint is rather restrained.  He fills the frame with decadence, debauchery, and dishonesty, but never has he relied on his actors to make a film work as much as he does here.  Fortunately, they are up to the task, but this circumstance is why The Wolf of Wall Street is not the classic Scorsese film that it could have been.  Nonetheless, like all other Scorsese films, the plot is nothing but a mode at which to create a commentary on a deeper subtext.  Belfort&#8217;s story is used as a way for the filmmaker to tell a story about intoxication, greed, and the destruction of the American fabric.  He does all of this with a playful tone however, which is what gives the film such energy!  The irreverence of this film is impossible to capture into words and that&#8217;s exactly what Scorsese intended.  With a running time of three hours, it is clear that Scorsese did not want to shy away from the bacchanalian excess that plays such a large part in the film.  At the risk of hitting the audience over the head with this fact, the drug of choice for most characters is the &#8220;lude&#8221; (short for Quaalude), which tenaciously reflects the conduct of everyone in this film.  In one scene, high on ludes, DiCaprio has lost all sense of mobility and yet must crawl, writhe, and tumble his way to his Ferrari in the hopes to then drive home and stop Donnie from revealing money laundering evidence into a tapped phone.  This scene is one of only a few characteristically Scorsese scenes, and for DiCaprio it is particularly impressive.  Never has DiCaprio been more physical, comedic, energetic, and kinetically charged than he is in this film.  Jay Gatsby would literally implode after one second in Jordan Belfort&#8217;s shoes.In a montage towards the end set to the Lemonheads cover of Simon and Garfunkel&#8217;s &#8220;Mrs. Robinson,&#8221; the line &#8220;Every way you look at it, you lose,&#8221; critically suggests that the intoxication of the previous 150 minutes is beginning to ware off.  We have a moment to finally catch our breaths after the yachts, the mansions, the sex, the money, and the helicopters are all out of sight and we are amazed at what we&#8217;ve witnessed.After an Academy member premier of the film, a screenwriter very publicly shouted, &#8220;Shame on you!&#8221; at the legendary director.  Accordingly, I witnessed several people walk out of the screening that I was in. Certainly, the world DiCaprio and Scorsese explore this time around is fearlessly audacious.  Nonetheless, the film is based on Belfort&#8217;s own memoir, and the screenplay is co-written by the man who wrote and produced The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire, Terence Winter.  Those shows and this film all have the united goal of exploring morally bankrupt people who fill that void with the greatest drug of all, money.  Our society is badly hooked on this drug and as good as we are at hiding the evidence of what greed has done to us, stories like The Wolf of Wall Street serve as reminders, reminders that make some filmgoers uncomfortable.  Still, as much of a fan as I am of this film, I submit that The Wolf of Wall Street is Goodfellas-Lite: Henry Hill enters stock market.  I think a 5 and  hour American nightmare double feature is in my future!  A-The Wolf of Wall Street is rated R and has a running time of 3 hours.  Look out for many recognizable faces in supporting roles including the real life Jordan Belfort.  This film is packed to the brim &#8211; there is so much to discuss and mention, but this review is long enough!Also, prepare yourself for that &#8216;ludes&#8217; Ferrari scene, it&#8217;s

The film runs almost three hours, but I am not sure if the film is really worth that time of your life.Based on the memoir of Jordan Belfort (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) or the &#8220;Wolf&#8221; of Wall Street, the film starts with the days of his wild lifestyles back in the 90s as the founder of New York brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont. Unfortunately Scorsese seems too much interested how wild it could be, taking 90 minutes to tell us what could be told in 45 minutes.

1687300,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00H9KKGTO,Turfseer,"[5, 7]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0I like to think of 'The Wolf of Wall Street' as a poor man's 'Good Fellas'. They're both based on a true story about a character who is a moral failure and they both rely quite a bit on a narrator as well as improvised dialogue. 'Good Fellas' was primarily successful due to the strong, believable performances of Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci; both those actors were of Italian descent and they were playing characters that also were supposed to be Italian. But here Leonardo DiCaprio is supposed to play Jordan Belfort, a Jewish guy from Queens. I watched clips of the real Belfort and I just felt DiCaprio doesn't come close to capturing the essence of the 'Wolf of Wall Street' (maybe I associate DiCaprio with too many other characters in films that he's been in before or maybe he simply is unable to move beyond his own persona). One other problem is that the stakes in 'Good Fellas' were much higher: there was that enormous Lufthansa heist and people being whacked all over the place; but here it's just a matter of investors being conned (who you never get to see on screen) and an anti-hero who's prone to a life of extraordinary excess.Still, Belfort's antics are mildly interesting, especially in the first half hour, where in a series of flashbacks, we see how he lost his stock broker job on his very first day on Wall Street due to the stock market crash of 1987. Matthew McConaughey is highly entertaining as Belfort's sleazy supervisor who imparts his 'greed is good' philosophy to the fledging shyster, while they dine together in a high-end restaurant. Probably the highlight of the first half hour is when Belfort employs a new phone script at the low class 'boiler room' where he's recently been hired--Belfort proves to be much polished than his fellow employees, who rely more on intimidation than finesse. Way less successful is Jonah Hill's character, Donnie Azoff (Danny Porush in real life). There's really nothing distinctive about Azoff (unlike a Joe Pesci in 'Good Fellas) except for the fact that he's married to his first cousin; Hill basically has no memorable scenes (unless you consider the ridiculous fight between Donnie and one of Belfort's drug couriers later in the film).Once Belfort is locked and loaded as CEO of the newly minted (and seemingly respectable) 'Oakmont Stratton', Scorsese's strategy is to highlight most of Belfort's reported true-life escapades. We're asked to laugh at the morally corrupt Belfort as Scorsese blasts us with Belfort's outrages piled on one after another. Not all of it essential to the plot. Take for example the scene where his wife's gay butler throws a party for his friends and some of Belfort's cash in the apartment ends up missing. The whole point of the scene is to show how ruthless and greedy Belfort is, with the butler ending up being held by his legs over a balcony. It's an interesting scene but again, not essential; cutting it could have contributed to the necessary shortening of the entire film, to a much more manageable two hour fest, as opposed to three.Another problem is Scorsese's penchant for stretching things out beyond any modicum of good direction (as well as plain good aesthetics). I'm thinking of the scene where Belfort is wasted after downing the Lemmon- 714 Quaaludes; after taking too many, Belfort finds himself at a country club where he's no longer able to work, so he has to crawl to his car. Yes it's supposed to be funny but the long 'crawl' just goes on for too long and dilutes whatever humor Scorsese is attempting to extract from the situation. Another drawn out scene which loses its comic effect is the yacht being tossed in the storm. After about a minute we get the idea but Scorsese doubles down on the slapstick, with Belfort and crew being tossed around ad infinitum.The dialogue here is very inconsistent. One very good scene is the cat and mouse conversation Belfort has with the FBI agent on his yacht. But often, Scorsese insists that his actors improvise, sacrificing verisimilitude (one example that sounded improvised to me, was the early Belfort-Donnie exchange where they discuss Donnie's incestuous relationship with his wife).While many people will find it hard to believe, most of the scenes in the movie actually happened (if we are to believe Belfort's book--same name as the film). One scene that didn't happen were the dwarfs being tossed around at the office party (at the beginning of the film). A critical scene that did not happen in real life is when Belfort slips the note to Donnie that he's wearing a wire. I understand that Belfort did this with another one of his employees but not Donnie. I think it was a mistake for Scorsese to take liberties here since the implication is Belfort is not such a bad guy after all, since he's not willing to betray his best friend (but in reality, he did).Ultimately, 'The Wolf of Wall Street' would have been a much better if it was shorter. Not all of Belforts' machinations are that interesting; after a while the greed simply becomes grating. Scorsese wants us to laugh at some of the outrageous things Belfort does and occasionally we end up amused. But 'Wolf' is also a cautionary tale about not following a good path in life. Scorcese and DiCaprio are critical of the 'old' Belfort but seem to have forgiven the 'new' (note that the real-life Belfort gets a cameo at film's end). Is Belfort really a new man? Prosecutors have recently alleged that Belfort only paid a fraction of the restitution he owes, detailed in the original plea agreement. Perhaps it's time for a new accounting. That's one important point I would have liked to have seen highlighted at end of 'The Wolf of Wall Street'.",2,Occasionally interesting chronicle of Wall Street scam artist's life ends up as a poor

While the satire and twisted, witty humour kept the film alive from it treading into Margin Call or Wall Street (Oliver Stone film) territory, it does lag in many corners.It is far too long for a film with this subject at 3 hours rendering it self-indulgent and smug and it relied more on sensationalism than story itself. It reminded a bit too much of Casino, another 3-hour long Scorsese film that manages to make you scratch your head but only differences is that Wall St. did not have Sharon Stone and lacked the humour like this film.The film is neither terrible nor great as it does make use of a tempo that is unfathomable in films with this length and manages to make humour and some very provocative speeches and commentary about vice through the halls of economic, plutocratic power in the same way that Aaron Sorkin managed to do some heavy-handed commentary in the TV show, The Newsroom. Matthew McConaughey, despite a small screen presence, steals the show as a smug forefather to Belfort (played by DiCaprio) and his future infamy.However, if you like your over-the-top, sensational (extreme depictions of sex, drugs, and strong language), crass, mean-spirited, and anti-Oscar friendly, you might like to check this one out.&#34;",3,"Drug and sex-fuelled madness in an overwhelming 3-hour long bottle!

As I've already said, this movie as a whole was simply a long, slow slog just to get all the way through.  I could almost give it a 3 star pass because of DiCaprio's dynamic acting--perhaps his best ever--but I simply could not bring myself to bump it up from 2 stars because of the inherent ugliness of this film and it's characters.  I didn't even like any of the ""good guys"" (the FBI guys).The sad fact is that I have known a few people like this in the corporate world in which I live. I try to stay as far away from them as possible. These types are the very epitome of greed and debauchery. Look, I'm anything but a prude.  My dislike of this film has nothing at all to do with the nudity or the language, although most of the women depicted were largely a rather large collection of stereotypical whores. Even the supposed ""better"" women in the movie are primarily driven by the same greed that their spouses possess and use their sexuality to gain entrance into this insane world of ill-gotten booty built on the backs of the Belfort flunkies.  This brings me to another major flaw with this film:  the absolute one-dimensionality of almost all of the characters.  Most characters in ""The Wolf.."" have no depth.  They are almost all stereotypes rather than fully fleshed out real people. They are almost all reduced to cartoon character status; mindless robots controlled by Belfort's constant line of bull-slinging ""motivational"" speeches.  His entire empire is comprised of these mindless sycophantic whores: willing to do whatever their Belfort god says as long as it makes them rich.  And once rich, what do they do with their outrageous earnings? To a man and woman:  party, do drugs and have sex with each other as well as a large group of eager prostitutes. They chronically cheat on their spouses, lie, steal, and whatever else it takes to keep themselves rich and entertained because they are so fundamentally flawed and shallow, they seem to lack any imagination at all.  Being filthy rich is inevitably never enough to fill the holes in their worthless souls.  The fact that Jordan Belfort ratted on all of his friends and colleagues in order to save his own ass and, as a result of his ""cooperation"", received only 36 months in jail is a testament as well to our deeply flawed and broken justice system. I never want to watch this film again in spite of DiCaprio's brilliant performance.  It was neither ""fun"" or entertaining enough for me to ever go back to it again.",2,"Could not get myself to like ""The Wolf.."" in spite of DiCaprio's amazing performance",1405296000,"07 14, 2014",2014,3792,"['took', 'three', 'more', 'tries', 'get', 'way', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'how', 'repulsive', 'found', 'Let', 'be', 'mistake', 'DiCaprio', 'terrific', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'Wolf', 'was', 'ONLY', 'reason', 'kept', 'trying', 'make', 'stick', 'bitter', 'end', 'movie', 'whole', 'just', 'found', 'character', 'completely', 'despicable', 'including', 'course', 'DiCaprio', 'own', 'character', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'Wolf..', 'bunch', 'annoying', 'amoral', 'greedy', 'drug', 'addict', 'con', 'artist', 'blowhards', 'who', 'eventually', 'get', 'what', 'deserve.There', 'undeniably', 'great', 'acting', 'several', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'notably', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'playing', 'part', 'Donnie', 'rather', 'pathetic', 'true', 'love', 'Belfort', 'Sure', 'Wolf', 'have', 'terrific', 'script', 'times', 'actually', 'pretty', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'have', 'referred', 'Wolf..', 'black', 'comedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'way', 'good', 'black', 'comedy', 'especially', 'movies', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'such', 'Inglorious', 'Basterds', 'matter', 'Django', 'Unchained', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'being', 'same', 'league', 'Tarantino', 'works', 'primary', 'problem', 'Wolf..', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'already', 'said', 'movie', 'whole', 'was', 'simply', 'long', 'slow', 'slog', 'just', 'get', 'way', 'could', 'almost', 'give', '3', 'star', 'pass', 'DiCaprio', 'dynamic', 'acting', 'perhaps', 'best', 'ever', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'bring', 'bump', 'up', '2', 'stars', 'inherent', 'ugliness', 'film', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'good', 'guys', 'FBI', 'guys', '.The', 'sad', 'fact', 'have', 'known', 'few', 'people', 'corporate', 'world', 'live', 'try', 'stay', 'far', 'away', 'possible', 'types', 'are', 'very', 'epitome', 'greed', 'debauchery', 'Look', ""'m"", 'anything', 'prude', 'dislike', 'film', 'nothing', 'do', 'nudity', 'language', 'most', 'women', 'depicted', 'were', 'largely', 'rather', 'large', 'collection', 'stereotypical', 'whores', 'Even', 'supposed', 'better', 'women', 'movie', 'are', 'primarily', 'driven', 'same', 'greed', 'spouses', 'possess', 'use', 'sexuality', 'gain', 'entrance', 'insane', 'world', 'ill-gotten', 'booty', 'built', 'backs', 'Belfort', 'flunkies', 'major', 'flaw', 'film', 'absolute', 'one-dimensionality', 'almost', 'characters', 'Most', 'characters', 'Wolf..', 'have', 'depth', 'are', 'almost', 'stereotypes', 'rather', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'real', 'people', 'are', 'almost', 'reduced', 'cartoon', 'character', 'status', 'robots', 'controlled', 'Belfort', 'constant', 'line', 'bull-slinging', 'motivational', 'speeches', 'entire', 'empire', 'comprised', 'mindless', 'sycophantic', 'whores', 'willing', 'do', 'whatever', 'Belfort', 'god', 'as', 'long', 'rich', 'once', 'rich', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'outrageous', 'earnings', 'man', 'woman', 'party', 'do', 'drugs', 'have', 'sex', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'large', 'group', 'eager', 'prostitutes', 'chronically', 'cheat', 'spouses', 'lie', 'steal', 'else', 'keep', 'rich', 'entertained', 'are', 'so', 'fundamentally', 'flawed', 'shallow', 'seem', 'lack', 'imagination', 'Being', 'filthy', 'rich', 'inevitably', 'never', 'enough', 'fill', 'holes', 'worthless', 'souls', 'fact', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'ratted', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'order', 'save', 'own', 'ass', 'result', 'cooperation', 'received', 'only', '36', 'months', 'jail', 'testament', 'as', 'well', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'broken', 'justice', 'system', 'never', 'want', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'spite', 'DiCaprio', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'was', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'ever', 'go', 'back', 'again']",N/A

Nothing is safe.  Even the once highly respectable Rob Reiner sinks shoulder deep down into the mud with these wretched villains.I sat in the theater for the entirety of it's 180minute running time in utter dismay at the proceedings being shined on the silver screen in front of me.  That is 10800 seconds for anyone counting.  And that's not the only thing I for one was counting.  There were innumerable moments of nudity, cocaine, alcohol, hookers and an overall general terrible attitude on display by these men.  And the curse words!  I lost track trying to count up all the flagrant usage of a particular F word that was said not once if not for 547 times at least.I don't mind being shocked for the sake of being shocked.

1687325,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B00H9KKGTO,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[16, 29]","Directed by Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Terence Winter (Boardwalk Empire, The Sopranos) adapted from the book of the same name by Jordan Belfort, The Wolf of Wall Street is something of a mixed bag.  On the one hand, it has a number of great performances, most notably those of Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort, the ""Wolf of Wall Street"" title character, and Jonah Hill as his manic over-the-top best friend and cohort Donnie Azoff. Or rather, what would've been great performances if they hadn't in scene after scene gone on _way_ longer than they should've. And it's also about a memorable bit of Wall Street history, of Jordan Belfort and Stratton Oakmont, the brokerage firm he founded that acquired the nickname ""The Boiler Room"" for its high-pressure environment and became infamous for its unscrupulous business practices and its excesses on every scale imaginable.  The problem is that the film focuses far, far more on the excesses (drinking, drugs, sex, money) than on anything else to the point that the film itself becomes a study in excess. It also fails to show the effects of what Belfort and his cronies did to the investors they conned. The victims of their fraud are virtually invisible, making you wonder what Belfort and Stratton Oakmont were actually guilty of.The film begins in 1987, when Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) gets a job as a stockbroker at an investment firm on Wall Street. One of the firm's executives, Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey), becomes his mentor and initiates Belfort into the high-pressure and high-excess life of Wall Street of the late 1980's, intriguing Belfort with his devil take the hindmost approach. But just after Belfort passes his exam and earns his broker's license to become a full-fledged stockbroker, Black Monday hits and the bottom falls out of the market, causing him and a lot of other brokers to lose their jobs.With so many stockbrokers out of work and so few firms hiring, Belfort becomes discouraged and starts to consider looking for other types of work, but his wife Teresa (Cristin Milioti) spots an ad for a company that says they're actually looking for stockbrokers. The company turns out to be Investor Center, a small-time operation run out of an old boiler room where low-level brokers deal in penny stocks sold over-the-phone to small investors. Belfort's aggressive but highly-polished (and ruthlessly deceptive) sales pitch style pay off big, to the amazement of the other brokers who quickly adopt his approach. Shortly after his fortunes take off at Investor Center, Belfort hooks up with Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), a salesman who happens to live in the same apartment complex as he does, and they decide to open their own firm together, starting with several of Belfort's friends (whose only real sales experience is as marijuana dealers) and some of his co-workers from Investor Center. The firm, which he gives the respectable ""old firm""-sounding name of Stratton Oakmont, quickly takes off, and after Forbes magazine does an article on Belfort naming him ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", suddenly every young and aggressive broker on Wall Street wants to work for him and almost overnight Stratton Oakmont becomes a billion-dollar company. And life at Stratton Oakmont becomes one big never-ending party with liquor, drugs and prostitutes - and most importantly money - flowing non-stop.More than anything else, The Wolf of Wall Street is a film that desperately needed a good film editor.  Actually, after looking into it, I found that the film _had_ a good editor, three-time Academy Award winner Thelma Schoonmaker (Raging Bull, The Aviator and The Departed).  So I am at a loss to explain why this film came out so self-indulgently long.  But regardless of who is to blame, The Wolf of Wall Street was one of the only films I've ever seen where I found myself actually wishing I was watching the edited-for-length TV version instead.  A good example of the problem by way of contrast is Matthew McConaughey's performance as Belfort's early mentor Mark Hanna.  McConaughey really only has one scene in the entire film but it's a great and memorable one, partly because of McConaughey's performance but also because it's exactly as long as it needs to be and no longer.  Contrast this with a later scene where a drug-addled DiCaprio is desperately trying to get home to warn an equally drug-addled Hill against talking to their Swiss banker on his home phone which he's just learned has been bugged by the FBI. Ordinarily this would have been a brilliantly comic scene, but it ends up going on for so long that it loses its comedic value and you end up just wishing that they'd stop and move on to the rest of the movie.One bit of film trivia worth noting: the use of profanity in The Wolf of Wall Street is not merely prolific, it's record-breaking.  The film has the dubious distinction of holding the all-time record for Most Uses of the F-word in a non-documentary feature film - a whopping 506 times in a little less than 3 hours. The previous record holder was Spike Lee's 1999 film Summer of Sam with 435 uses.Recommended, mainly for DiCaprio and Hill's performances and for its lavish, almost slavish portrayal of Wall Street excess, with the advice that the fast-forward button may well end up being your best friend after the first hour or so.",3,Great performances marred by lack of editing and excessive focus on

An outrageous 3 hour drug and sex filled and darkly hilarious romp featuring the best performances I've seen all year.Leonardo Di Caprio is one of my favorite actors and even knowing his talent, I was still shocked just by how fantastic he was as Jordan Belfort. Despite being a huge fan, I almost couldn't believe I was watching the same Di Cpario I'd been seeing for years as he carried the film with such charisma and energy! It's by far the performance of the career and it he should more than deserving receive an Academy Award for Best Actor (although he will probably be snubbed). Leo is not the only one fantastic here, Jonah Hill also gives the performance of his career here as well and Matthew McConaughey also shines in the brief amount of the film he appears in.Director Martin Scorsese who has directed some of the best films ever made brings his magic touch in telling this bizarre true story. Despite being 71 years old, he still knows how to have fun telling this story bring a wonderful visual style and fast pace at which the films 3 hour runtime fly's by. But it's not only Scorsese's directing that makes the film work so well, Terence Winter's writing just as equally plays a role in the films brilliance as well with his script filled with dark humor and excellent dialogue that will be quoted in years to come. On top of that, the two hold no bars on exploring Belfort's wild lifestyle refusing to shy away from the excessive amount of drugs and sex involved. This is one of the most graphic mainstream films I have seen in quite some time. But it's pervasiveness only favors the film making it all the more fun and entertaining.Even though it's long length, graphic content, and dark humor will turn some off, The Wolf of Wall Street ranks up as the best film I've seen all year and one of Scorsese's best!",5,Another Masterpiece from Martin Scorsese,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,1970,"['Martin', 'Scorsese', 'once', 'again', 'brought', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'most', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'viewing', 'experiences', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'outrageous', '3', 'hour', 'drug', 'sex', 'filled', 'darkly', 'hilarious', 'romp', 'featuring', 'best', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year.Leonardo', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'even', 'knowing', 'talent', 'was', 'still', 'shocked', 'just', 'how', 'fantastic', 'was', 'Jordan', 'Belfort', 'being', 'huge', 'fan', 'almost', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'watching', 'same', 'Di', 'Cpario', ""'d"", 'been', 'seeing', 'years', 'carried', 'film', 'such', 'charisma', 'energy', 'far', 'performance', 'career', 'should', 'more', 'deserving', 'receive', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actor', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'snubbed', 'Leo', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'fantastic', 'here', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'also', 'performance', 'career', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'also', 'brief', 'amount', 'film', 'in.Director', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'who', 'directed', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'brings', 'magic', 'touch', 'telling', 'bizarre', 'true', 'story', 'being', '71', 'years', 'old', 'still', 'how', 'have', 'fun', 'telling', 'story', 'bring', 'wonderful', 'visual', 'style', 'fast', 'pace', 'films', '3', 'hour', 'runtime', 'fly', 'not', 'only', 'Scorsese', 'directing', 'film', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'Terence', 'Winter', 'writing', 'just', 'equally', 'role', 'films', 'brilliance', 'as', 'well', 'script', 'filled', 'dark', 'humor', 'excellent', 'dialogue', 'will', 'be', 'quoted', 'years', 'come', 'top', 'two', 'hold', 'bars', 'exploring', 'Belfort', 'wild', 'lifestyle', 'refusing', 'shy', 'away', 'excessive', 'amount', 'drugs', 'sex', 'involved', 'one', 'most', 'graphic', 'mainstream', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'quite', 'time', 'pervasiveness', 'only', 'film', 'making', 'more', 'fun', 'entertaining.Even', 'long', 'length', 'graphic', 'content', 'dark', 'humor', 'will', 'turn', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'up', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'one', 'Scorsese', 'best']",N/A
