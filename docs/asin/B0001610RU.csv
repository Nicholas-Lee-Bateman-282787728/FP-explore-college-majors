794001,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B0001610RU,Ernest Jagger,"[7, 8]","This 26TH and final Zatoichi episode from 1989 brought an end to this wonderfully long odyssey starring the late Shintaro Katsu. Since the beginning of the series in 1962, Zatoichi defined the humble swordsman who tried to live the Bushido code--only to be foiled by his fellow yakuza; or encountering evildoers who preyed upon the innocent. And as a blind character in the series, all too often Zatoichi too was preyed upon by those who would try and take advantage of a blind man. Only he was no ordinary blind man. Zatoichi's flashing sword brought about swift and exacting vengeance on any who would foolishly attempt to cross paths with him. And this final film was no exception.This final installment of Zatoichi is an excellent film. The acting and cinematography are outstanding. In this film we find an older and much greyer Zatoichi. The last Zatoichi full-length feature film was in 1973, however, Shintaro Katsu did a television series as Zatoichi with 100 episodes up until 1979. In this film Zatoichi's sword is as lethal as ever. And the ending of the film proves this. We also see Zatoichi being betrayed by a friend due to the price that was placed on his head: One who supposedly lived by the Bushido code.The action sequences are terrific, and Zatoichi is just as fast as ever. I really liked this final episode of the peace-loving Zatoichi who is content to just be left alone; and yet cannot, due to the fact that he is Zatoichi and his reputation is too great for him to ever be left alone in peace. And more importantly, where the main theme in the film is that once again  good-conquers-evil. I highly recommend this film to everyone, and especially to all Zatoichi fans.

In 1989 I was one year from finishing high school and going into college.

The first 30 or so minutes of this movie are the best, with good direction and photography; gets a bit tedious afterwards.  Does have a good battle climax, with Zatoichi once again taking on over a dozen men at the same time, unlike the wimp climax of the movie version of CONAN, in which Arnold needed help.The weirdest thing about this movie: there's not only only a song in English over a montage of Zatoichi walking---but it's the sort of song you'd expect in a ROCKY movie!",2,THE USUAL ZATOICHI,1302739200,"04 14, 2011",2011,745,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'Zatoichi', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'almost', 'one', 'playing', 'dice', 'meeting', 'new', 'friend', 'who', 'later', 'kill', 'scenes', 'are', 'movie.But', ""'re"", 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'one', 'ok', 'too', 'plot', 'kinda', 'confusing', 'first', '30', 'so', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'best', 'good', 'direction', 'photography', 'bit', 'tedious', 'afterwards', 'Does', 'have', 'good', 'battle', 'climax', 'Zatoichi', 'once', 'again', 'taking', 'dozen', 'men', 'same', 'time', 'wimp', 'climax', 'movie', 'version', 'CONAN', 'Arnold', 'needed', 'help.The', 'weirdest', 'thing', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'only', 'song', 'English', 'montage', 'Zatoichi', 'walking', 'sort', 'song', ""'d"", 'expect', 'ROCKY', 'movie']",Zatoichi - Darkness Is His Ally
794008,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B0001610RU,Zack Davisson,"[4, 5]","This is the way to end a legendary series.  Not with any wacky gimmicks, hip young sidekicks, new spectacular special-effects or anything else that betrays the feel and tone of a long-established character.  Just one last nostalgic trip into the gambling den, a flash of the deadly cane sword, and a retirement into quiet dignity.  Hollywood could learn a lot from ""Zatoichi: Darkness is his Ally"".Shintaro Katsu is not afraid to show his age.  Greying and weathered from a life of hard-living, his Zatoichi character has reached a level of subtlety and depth that can only come from the many years he spent in the title role.  All of the mannerisms, the ticks of the face and the gentle smiles, are as welcome as an old friend you haven't seen for a long, long time.  He is still a rouge and a scoundrel, and he still pulls that same old dice trick that he has had up his sleeve for decades, but you forgive this old dog for never having learned a new trick.  (Although he does get a little action with a pretty lady, which was a bit of a surprise.  A departure from the usual sad refusal and longing looks when a woman offers herself to the brave warrior...)The plot of the movie is...Zatoichi.  There are some people in trouble.  There is a beautiful woman.  There is a scrappy up-and-coming fighter who tries to live his life honorably by the bushido code, but you know that he will eventually be drawn into conflict with the sage warrior whose reputation precedes him.  Everything is paired down to the essential elements of a Zatoichi flick, and it delivers up exactly what we love with style and reverence.The film itself is beautiful, and is a real testament to Katsu's abilities, as he put in triple service as writer, director and actor.  He was dying at the time, and knew it, so this film was obviously very personal to him, his last outing as the character that had made him.  The music is quite haunting as well, with the shamisen being used to perfect effect.I wouldn't recommend this as anyone's first Zatoichi film. There is too much nostalgia here for that, and one should hold off on ""Darkness is his Ally"" until they have a dozen or so Zatoichi flicks under there belt.  But with 26 films in the series, that is pretty easy to do, and it will give you something to look forward to.",5,One last swing of the sword cane,1197417600,"12 12, 2007",2007,2301,"['way', 'end', 'legendary', 'series', 'Not', 'wacky', 'gimmicks', 'hip', 'young', 'sidekicks', 'new', 'spectacular', 'special-effects', 'anything', 'else', 'feel', 'tone', 'long-established', 'character', 'Just', 'one', 'last', 'nostalgic', 'trip', 'gambling', 'den', 'flash', 'deadly', 'cane', 'sword', 'retirement', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'learn', 'lot', 'Zatoichi', 'Darkness', 'Ally', '.Shintaro', 'Katsu', 'not', 'afraid', 'show', 'age', 'Greying', 'weathered', 'life', 'hard-living', 'Zatoichi', 'character', 'reached', 'level', 'subtlety', 'depth', 'can', 'only', 'come', 'many', 'years', 'spent', 'title', 'role', 'mannerisms', 'ticks', 'face', 'gentle', 'smiles', 'are', 'as', 'welcome', 'old', 'friend', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'still', 'rouge', 'scoundrel', 'still', 'same', 'old', 'dice', 'trick', 'had', 'up', 'sleeve', 'decades', 'forgive', 'old', 'dog', 'never', 'having', 'learned', 'new', 'trick', 'get', 'little', 'action', 'pretty', 'lady', 'was', 'bit', 'surprise', 'departure', 'usual', 'sad', 'refusal', 'longing', 'looks', 'when', 'woman', 'brave', 'warrior', 'plot', 'movie', 'Zatoichi', 'are', 'people', 'trouble', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'scrappy', 'up-and-coming', 'fighter', 'who', 'live', 'life', 'honorably', 'bushido', 'code', 'know', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'drawn', 'conflict', 'sage', 'warrior', 'reputation', 'Everything', 'paired', 'down', 'essential', 'elements', 'Zatoichi', 'flick', 'up', 'exactly', 'what', 'love', 'style', 'reverence.The', 'film', 'beautiful', 'real', 'testament', 'Katsu', 'abilities', 'put', 'triple', 'service', 'writer', 'director', 'actor', 'was', 'dying', 'time', 'knew', 'so', 'film', 'was', 'obviously', 'very', 'personal', 'last', 'outing', 'character', 'had', 'made', 'music', 'quite', 'haunting', 'as', 'well', 'shamisen', 'being', 'used', 'perfect', 'effect.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'first', 'Zatoichi', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'nostalgia', 'here', 'one', 'should', 'hold', 'off', 'Darkness', 'Ally', 'have', 'dozen', 'so', 'Zatoichi', 'flicks', 'belt', '26', 'films', 'series', 'pretty', 'easy', 'do', 'will', 'give', 'something', 'look', 'forward']",Zatoichi - Darkness Is His Ally
