I even saw Jeff perform at Air Canada Centre in Toronto this past January.  So when I'd heard he was releasing yet another stand-up DVD, I was ecstatic.As I watched, excitement quickly turned to disappointment.  I found most of the show to be painfully unfunny.  More beer puns from Bubba J, more racial slurs from Peanut, and some extremely lame jokes from Achmed.  The show's only saving grace in my opinion was Walter's segment.  I found myself laughing through most of THAT material.I realize comedy is extremely subjective, and that what I may not find funny....others may find hilarious.  That being said, I thought this was undoubtedly his weakest effort yet.  More a case of ""style over substance"" if you will.  Each character had their own flashy intros.

This show is a bit different from shows such as 'Arguing with Myself' in that each of his puppets appears as a Halloween themed 'monster.'  I won't spoil the fun by divulging which monsters appear, but they are all cleverly done.  Each character is introduced with a horror movie trailer video, all fairly well done, even if they are not super funny.  One nice feature on the DVD is that you have the option of playing either a bleeped or an unbleeped version of the show.  This is a good feature for family viewing, as Dunham definitely peppers his shows with the f-word and other profanity.  (My wish is that he would tone this part of his act down, as I think his material is hilarious enough to be funny without all the profanity.)  Special features include a worthwhile outtake segment.  One rather annoying aspect of this DVD is that, at least on my computer, I cannot skip forward or backward, say, if I want to view a joke a second time.  You can navigate from segment to segment only.  If you haven't seen any of his other shows I would start with the above mentioned show or 'Controlled Chaos'.  Why?  I don't know if Dunham was limited by the Halloween theme, but even though this disc is quite funny, the humor for me never reaches the inspired heights of the above three shows.
