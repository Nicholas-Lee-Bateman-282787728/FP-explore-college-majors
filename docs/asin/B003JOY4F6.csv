1347664,A93AYSDMVYD8W,B003JOY4F6,"Ab Uffalo ""akira""","[3, 3]","The debut feature film by Sandy Collora (Sandy who?) is simply, quite extraordinary. To learn more about Sandy, check out IMDB or Wikipedia. To learn how to make awesome science fiction films on a shoestring budget, and yet produce something that looks & feels like it cost countless millions, then just watch Hunter Prey. Collora is both producer & director, as well as one the actors in the film, and carries out some of the production roles as well. The result is one of the best science fiction films of 2009/2010, alongside Monsters & the earlier District 9. The storyline is simple; aliens are hunting human prey across a desolate sandy landscape. The aliens are reduced to one, & the hunt becomes a game of wits between the hunter & the hunted. But as the story unfolds, nothing is as it seems, and the viewer is drawn into one deception after another, sort of like a good mystery novel that has several twists in the tail. The actors are all unknowns, and yet all rise to the task superbly. The hardware used in the film looks more professional than that used in most sci-fi films of recent years, and the cinematography is simply outstanding. Collora keeps a tight rein on the film, to ensure the action doesn't sag, and the script is always concise & words not wasted, or unnecessary. The quality of this film makes a mockery of many of the recent big budget movies of this genre, and shows just what can be done by an artist like Collora. He presents us with an apocalyptic space adventure borne of precious little finances, & succeeds beyond belief.

Most of the movie is a boring ""chase"" through a desert.  Watching paint dry is more exciting. The initial reversal of roles was predictable.  There is no ending, suggesting this was a pilot for a series that never happened (surprise, surprise).OK, Alex, tell us what you really think!  This is the worst sort of shlock that fills the space that used to be call Sci Fi.  There are no Sci Fi elements to this movie.  There is no ""what if"" scenario, or even the stupidest kind (e.g. prehistoric/mutated monster on the rampage).  It is just props and costume.  Alien planet (desert with close orbiting moons, check).  Hardware (spaceship, guns, talking communicator, check), Aliens (rubber face mask, check).  This movie could be rewritten with minimal word changes to be set in any historical time.  Maybe it already was.  There is so little actual dialog that by comparison, Conan would seem to have verbal diarrhea.I have no idea what the producers thought they were doing, but this is a real turkey. Watch something else.  Anything else.[Note that I watched this movie on Netflix where I was suckered by the high ratings.

It's not bad, and worth seeing once if you're an SF fan, but otherwise of little consequence.The film is a sequel, of sorts, to Enemy Mine, the D. Quaid/L. Gossett film from 1985 (dir:W. Petersen). However, it is sufficiently detached that it's not necessary to know the previous film.This film is a well-paced chase across an alien landscape, but really only 'alien' by virtue of an orange moon in the sky. The alien environment-suits teeter on the edge of parody but, as with the moon trick, I have to admire how good the film looks given the obvious budget constraints. It's also a serious film, and reasonably intelligent, despite the corrupting influence of military SF (one of the more appalling cultural swings of recent time). It's probably not military enough to satisfy those fans, not hard S-F enough to satisfy those of us from that era, not complex enough for drama lovers, and not spectacular enough for action fans. I'm not sure who's left to hand in all these inflated 5-star reviews.Anyway, there are enough twists to keep one interested, and the film is no longer than it needs to be (an uncommon virtue these days). However, the dialogue is often unclear, and the resolution was as well, although that may have been a consequence of the former. I could have used closed captioning on several occasions.Although there is almost no plot, the actors did a good job of realizing their characters, the effects were good enough, the film was smart enough not to become a joke, and the whole package was an enjoyable 90 minutes, which I doubt I will ever want to repeat (enjoyable fluff is still fluff).

But although it pays homage to its predecessors, it stands alone as a truly original masterpiece of story-telling, cinematography and direction. Considering this film was made basically out of the director's garage, from a budget that amounted to the life savings of members of the crew, it's astonishing what they were able to pull off - wonderful make-up and creature designs, believable special effects, highly detailed miniatures, and breathtaking cinematography shot on a top-notch camera. The less you know about the story of this movie the better, because there are several twists and turns in the well-crafted plot that will truly surprise you. The dialogue could have used a little work, particularly among the aliens - it seemed far too human - and the opening special effect shot could have been a little better. But DO NOT write this film off for those reasons! This is not a stupid sy-fy original movie or a B-grade DVD. This is a quality flick produced from a sheer passion for the material.

Shows to go ya that a good flick doesn't need a huge budget to be pulled off.Here's the scoop. A spaceship crashes on a desert planet and the alien rangers on board lose their prisoner whom they are supposed to make certain is delivered alive. A cat and mouse ensues as they try to recapture a prey who is determined to stay free.This is a smart flick. They had little budget so they shot it in the American southwest and spent the dough on makeup, costumes, hardware and a few (very few) special effects. They kept the characters to a minimum and lensed it really well. This has a clean, sharp look to it and the shots were generally framed well. The matching shots/ continuity and editing were all pro level. The story is decent with one really big, fun surprise. There were a few concessions made to help the viewer. One being that the two species spoke the same language and used the same method for calculating celestial coordinates, but I suppose, given the budget, this was an efficient way to go. This is just a nifty little flick.Had there been a few more dollars and a bit better script this could have been a real smash hit at the box office.

The plot twists and turns, flipping our sympathies and expectations along the way.The characters get us involved and have nice arcs as the story progresses, giving us more and more information along the way about who they are and what has put them on this desert rock of a planet. The character work by the actors is great, making the most of the opportunities even through heavy prosthetics in some cases.For fans of science fiction films the plot points can be a bit derivative causing the viewer to draw comparisons to many other films and tv shows but as a whole it presents a new take on those elements.  The costumes and design work are the same, baring similarities to what you've seen before and drawing on pop culture, but clearly not intending to knock off their predecessors.This is the feature directorial debut from Sandy Collora (look up his amazing short film Batman: Dead End.)  For a first outing it's solid, though the pacing lags a bit at times.  Ultimately the real limiting factor on the film is the incredibly shoestring budget.  The limited CG is where this really shows, as the costumes, make-up and cinematography are all excellent. Collora's work brings a cohesive vision to the world he has created leaving me wanting more. I would have loved to see a fuller, richer world with more characters but the lacking budget serves to keep us focused on the few characters we do meet.Overall this is a pretty good low budget sci-fi film, much better than you'd get from the typical made for cable movie and worth a look.

1347688,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B003JOY4F6,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[16, 17]","With low budget science fiction movies it is generally a gamble with the odds already set against you. I don't know what it is about science fiction that draws out the idiots who think they can make a quick buck slapping on some crappy sets on a mediocre script with lousy special effects when there are hundreds of other idiots doing that same thing. There is a glut in the market of these cheap films, and it's hard to tell which ones are worth your time. If you are a true blue rocked to the core sci-fi fan Hunter Prey is one of those worthwhile movies.I strongly recommend going into this movie with no idea what it's about. But if you must have a synopsis here's the best I can do without revealing too much. A ship crashes and some soldiers are tasked to retrieve an extremely dangerous escaped prisoner. That's all you need to know. Trust me. You get the most out of it that way.What I like about this film is how it deviates from your normal Sci-Fi in regards to how the story is layed out. Hunter Prey begins with putting you in the middle of a shootout with absolutely no idea what's going on. From there the story starts to unfold and you get more and more information on what's really going on. This sort of gradual reveal works really well with this plot. Especially when you get some intelligent dialog, good cinematography, and pacing that's slow enough to give you time to soak in all the atmosphere.As this mystery unfolds the real reasons this movie shines start to come through. This movie rides on the writing for the main players. Character development is subtle yet extremely well done. You get to know them with just the little details, and it works. This development is so well done it becomes almost impossible to see them in concepts black and white, good guy and villain. I found myself rooting for both (often times at the same time) as the two main characters seem to shift roles from villain to hero depending on the scene. You learn to love them when you see them on their own, and when they collide the interplay is just as good. I don't think I have ever seen a movie (sci-fi or otherwise) pull this off so well.If you need other shows to relate for me Hunter Prey most reminds me of Enemy Mine and the old Star Trek episode where Kirk is on a deserted planet in a fight to the death with the lizard-like Gorn (funny that I found somebody in the IMDB message board having the exact same thoughts). Enemy Mine in that you have two separate races that are on opposite sides and that Star Trek episode because of the survival skills both use as well as the wonderful desert backdrop. Granted this is a very different movie from both so take that for what you will.I love sci-fi for the technology, and Hunter Prey has some really nifty tech. Sure the rifles are generic looking (they were actually tweaked Nerf toy guns), but everything else was really cool. The soldier's armor looks like something you would always see illustrated in a book or comic, but hardly see in real life. The tech behind the suits is even cooler with their little computers (voiced by Buck Rogers star Erin Gray) that monitor your vitals and administer medication as well as do things like scan your environment and communicate offworld. Their is also a pretty neat pistol that knocks you off of your feet (sonic weapon maybe?). There is an assortment of other cool techie things shown throughout the movie that are designed smart and give that added flavor to the film.The acting is actually pretty good. Granted some characters are behind makeup, but if you ask me an actor who can emote behind all of that just using mostly your eyes is a good one. Some acting can get just a tiny bit over the top, but it never falls into melodrama. It was treat having Erin Gray voice the miniature computer. I didn't even recognize her she was so good. It took the end credits for me to realize it was her.Special effects are truly impressive and subtle you get very few space scenes and what you get is good. The really cool special effects are in the background like the orbiting sun and planets that give what's your average dessert landscape just enough of that offworld touch to reall sell it. There is one spaceship you see at the end of the movie and when it's in space it looks cool, but when on planet you do see the limits of the computer generated animation. Still nothing worse than you see anywhere else. Actually it's pretty awesome when you consider the budget.Hunter Prey was made on a shoestring budget at a good deal less than $500,000. And that's 2009 dollars. Most TV sitcoms have larger budgets than that. What they do with that budget is truly impressive. Even if you take into account there are very few actors and they are filming in one location, plus special effects are sparse and of course the Nerf props you still have a good show of what you can do on a tiny budget. Camera work is professional with a good eye on what to shoot. Everything was on location, which would mean a good deal extra expense just for going outside. Is it Oscar-worthy movie making? No. Not in the slightest. Which brings me to the movie's shortcomings.Being uber-low budget means the script couldn't get enough editing to tweak away some descrepancies. As much as I loved the plot some things, even after you factor all the clever twists and get a solid conclusion that wraps up the big questions nicely, still either felt awkward or didn't make sense. Granted you get the same things from big budget movies (mostly the ones with small minds), however in this arena it only makes the movie feel that much more low budget. These limitations hurt what is otherwise a lean and well oiled machine of a story. Also the soundtrack is... well... I didn't hate it. However the synth tracks that try to sound orchestral don't hit the mark. Again... it's a shorcoming of a tiny budget so this isn't really a big deal. The music just doesn't stand out as a positive, but it does fulfill its purpose.The DVD is a pretty good sendup for a microbudget movie. You get a 5.1 Dolby Digital and a stereo audio mix for sound and a nice widescreen presentation. What makes this a treat is the audio commentary by Director Sandy Collora, the mastermind behind the movie. His commentary is filled with interesting tidbits on the making of the film. There is also a half hour ""making of"" documentary with interviews with the rest of crew that show you the little tricks they do in making the movie look as good as it does.What can I say? Hunter Prey is a surprisingly good low budget science fiction film. It delves into character development rarely seen anywhere else. The shortcomings are way outshined by an impressive finished product. Do yourself a favor and see this movie.",5,Surprisingly good.,1312156800,"08 1, 2011",2011,6758,"['low', 'budget', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'generally', 'gamble', 'odds', 'already', 'set',

This movie is low budget to say the least, but low budget does not equal crap.  A movie can have 200 million dollars thrown at it and be terrible, I talking to you 'Green Lantern'.  It can also have 3 million dollars threw at it and be great.  This is the case with 'Hunter Prey', evidence that big bucks does not equal big blockbuster.This film contains great acting from the no-name actors.  They really put themselves into their roles and deliver believable performances.Did I forget to mention the stellar special effects make-up!!!  This movie has some of the most convincing looking aliens I've ever seen, PERIOD!!!  All this mind you without the over used CG we are forced to watch these days.  This film falls back on what used to make movies awesome, great make up.  I applaud those who worked on this film, you are true artists.Story wise, this is like 'Enemy Mine' with Dennis Quaid, except 'Hunter Prey' doesn't suck.  'Enemy Mine' did, the little bit of it I could stand to watch...COSTS WAY TOO MUCH on Amazon, like I mentioned at the beginning of this review, this is on The Movie Channel on tv periodically, so set your DVR to record.You will not be disappointed by giving this film a try, I promise.",5,A Surprisingly Good Sci Fi Flick,1333238400,"04 1, 2012",2012,1289,"['Just', 'watched', 'Movie', 'Channel', 'today', 'Was', 'plesantly', 'surprised', 'movie', 'low', 'budget', 'say', 'least', 'low', 'budget', 'not', 'equal', 'crap', 'movie', 'can', 'have', '200', 'million', 'dollars', 'thrown', 'be', 'terrible', 'talking', ""'Green"", 'Lantern', 'can', 'also', 'have', '3', 'million', 'dollars', 'threw', 'be', 'great', 'case', ""'Hunter"", 'Prey', 'evidence', 'big', 'bucks', 'not', 'equal', 'big', 'blockbuster.This', 'film', 'great', 'acting', 'no-name', 'actors', 'really', 'put', 'roles', 'deliver', 'believable', 'performances.Did', 'forget', 'mention', 'stellar', 'special', 'effects', 'make-up', 'movie', 'most', 'convincing', 'looking', 'aliens', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'PERIOD', 'mind', 'over', 'used', 'CG', 'are', 'forced', 'watch', 'days', 'film', 'back', 'what', 'used', 'make', 'movies', 'awesome', 'great', 'make', 'up', 'applaud', 'who', 'worked', 'film', 'are', 'true', 'artists.Story', 'wise', ""'Enemy"", 'Mine', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Prey', ""n't"", 'suck', ""'Enemy"", 'Mine', 'did', 'little', 'bit', 'could', 'stand', 'watch', 'COSTS', 'WAY', 'TOO', 'MUCH', 'Amazon', 'mentioned', 'beginning', 'review', 'Movie', 'Channel', 'tv', 'periodically', 'so', 'set', 'DVR', 'record.You', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'giving', 'film', 'try', 'promise']",Hunter Prey
