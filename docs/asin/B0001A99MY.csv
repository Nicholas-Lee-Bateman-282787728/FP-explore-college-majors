Unlike, the agitprop trying to be charmed into mainstream, this film is democratically correct. Cinematographically, it's studio style is commensurable with the emotional tone or ""mise en scene"" of German psychological thrillers, yet the storyline's characteristics are in tune with American philosophic points of view, as far as Western Civilizations goes. At first, I wasn't enjoying the film, but then surprising scenes made me stop and think. Now, I'm watching it every chance I get. (It's had a fecund affect on me.) There is a sense of diplomacy and comprehension that unfortunately skips a generation. This movie builds; not destroys. You have to see the movie up to the very end to understand how sound the moral is. It decently portrays man as a fully rational being. If it weren't for the profanity, I'd say that this film is adherent to the Logos.",5,Neopatriotism in a War Film,1176595200,"04 15, 2007",2007,993,"['wish', 'had', 'more', 'movies', 'one', 'movie', 'based', 'tragic', 'event', 'happened', 'decades', 'ago', 'modern', 'inflection', 'agitprop', 'trying', 'be', 'charmed', 'mainstream', 'film', 'democratically', 'correct', 'Cinematographically', 'studio', 'style', 'commensurable', 'emotional', 'tone', 'mise', 'en', 'scene', 'German', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'yet', 'storyline', 'characteristics', 'are', 'tune', 'American', 'philosophic', 'points', 'view', 'as', 'far', 'Western', 'Civilizations', 'first', 'was', ""n't"", 'enjoying', 'film', 'then', 'surprising', 'scenes', 'made', 'stop', 'think', 'Now', ""'m"", 'watching', 'chance', 'get', 'had', 'fecund', 'affect', 'sense', 'diplomacy', 'comprehension', 'unfortunately', 'generation', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'understand', 'how', 'sound', 'moral', 'decently', 'man', 'fully', 'rational', 'being', 'were', ""n't"", 'profanity', ""'d"", 'say', 'film', 'adherent', 'Logos']",N/A

After sitting through this teenaged angst fest, boys trying to delve deeply into their emotions, I felt like I had been sitting there for 12 hours.  The film goes nowhere and the ending is anti climatc.  It probably would have help, a lot, if the film had carried the story a little further, such as what happened to the boys when they actually got to the front line.  All we are left with is a group of idealistic young men going off to war, abd they could have wrapped up that story in about 30 minutes.",1,Boring Plus,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,633,"['action', 'film', 'apparently', 'place', 'entire', 'evening', 'night', 'news', 'bombing', 'Peal', 'Harbor', 'broke', 'sitting', 'teenaged', 'angst', 'fest', 'trying', 'delve', 'deeply', 'emotions', 'felt', 'had', 'been', 'sitting', 'there', '12', 'hours', 'film', 'nowhere', 'ending', 'anti', 'climatc', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'help', 'lot', 'film', 'had', 'carried', 'story', 'little', 'further', 'such', 'what', 'happened', 'boys', 'when', 'actually', 'got', 'front', 'line', 'are', 'left', 'group', 'idealistic', 'young', 'men', 'going', 'war', 'could', 'have', 'wrapped', 'up', 'story', '30', 'minutes']",N/A

It's a drama about 5 prep boys debating weather to join up after Pearl Harbor.  The whole thing takes place during one night, December 8th 1941.  Wheaton is taking a pacifist position, putting his best friendship with a patriot at risk.  These boys seem to have a new emotional crisis in every scene, and unfortunately that makes their competent acting seem a bit over the top, and about halfway through the film it loses it's effect.  However, you'll probably like December if you liked all of the following movies, even if it isn't as good as any of them:  Stand By Me, Toy Soldiers, Dead Poet's Society, and The Emperor's Club.  Of course they never do resolve who is right, or even tell what happens to any of them in the war; but they raise thought-provoking issues, such as can friendship survive diametric positions of patirot vs. pacifist.",3,"Too much unresolved emoting, but thought provoking drama.",1116115200,"05 15, 2005",2005,920,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'Wil', 'Wheaton', 'one', 'biggest', 'best', 'roles', 'drama', '5', 'prep', 'debating', 'weather', 'join', 'up', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'whole', 'thing', 'place', 'one', 'night', 'December', '8th', '1941', 'Wheaton', 'taking', 'pacifist', 'position', 'putting', 'best', 'friendship', 'patriot', 'risk', 'boys', 'seem', 'have', 'new', 'emotional', 'crisis', 'scene', 'unfortunately', 'competent', 'acting', 'seem', 'bit', 'top', 'halfway', 'film', 'effect', 'However', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'December', 'liked', 'following', 'movies', 'even', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Stand', 'Me', 'Toy', 'Soldiers', 'Dead', 'Poet', 'Society', 'Emperor', 'Club', 'course', 'never', 'do', 'resolve', 'who', 'right', 'even', 'tell', 'what', 'war', 'raise', 'thought-provoking', 'issues', 'such', 'can', 'friendship', 'survive', 'diametric', 'positions', 'patirot', 'vs.', 'pacifist']",N/A
