When I found out that the price of that movie alone was the same as the triple feature, I figure I had nothing to lose.  I'm glad I didn't pay extra for The Awakening (I found it offensive, actually), and Broken Lullaby (boring). Luckily, Loving Evangleine was just a good as I remembered.  It has an excellent mystery (the identity of the bad guy came as quite a surprise), and Nick Mancuso made me cry not once, but twice, talking about his murdered younger brother.  It is a movie I'll be watching again often.",3,One out of three ain't bad...,1217635200,"08 2, 2008",2008,576,"['saw', 'Loving', 'Evangeline', 'WTN', 'wanted', 'copy', 'myself', 'When', 'found', 'out', 'price', 'movie', 'alone', 'was', 'same', 'triple', 'feature', 'figure', 'had', 'nothing', 'lose', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'extra', 'Awakening', 'found', 'offensive', 'actually', 'Broken', 'Lullaby', 'boring', 'Luckily', 'Loving', 'Evangleine', 'was', 'just', 'good', 'remembered', 'excellent', 'mystery', 'identity', 'bad', 'guy', 'came', 'quite', 'surprise', 'Nick', 'Mancuso', 'made', 'cry', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'talking', 'murdered', 'younger', 'brother', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'again', 'often']",Harlequin Triple Feature Volume 4: (The Awakening / Broken Lullaby / Loving Evangeline)

You can preview them when they come on Lifetime, but I wanted to add them to my home library.  The movies are as good as the Harlequin books.  Very romantic and fun.  They are often fairly predictable, but still very enjoyable.  Here's what the back says.  May help you decide if you want to make the purchase:""The Awakening""A levelheaded young woman is thrown off balance when she teams up with a bounty hunter to track an antiques smuggler.  Her adventure leads her to discover a passion within her.""Broken Lullaby""Attempting to solve a family mystery, Jordan meets Nick, who is searching for the same music box that is her only clue.  But someone else is searching for the priceless antique.""Loving Evangeline""A powerful executive returns to his seaside hometown following his brother's fatal boating accident.

In order of best to least I would put The Awakening 1st but close with Broken Lullaby, and Loving Evangeline last.
