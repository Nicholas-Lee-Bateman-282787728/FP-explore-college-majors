Neither the original novel nor the r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the main actors; and certainly not sentimentality. This is not the place for re-living one's fantasy of the late '80sThis is DVD, a stand-alone product, a piece of entertainment. So, with the rose-tinted firmly in the bin, how does this stand up in 2010? Well, not that well, in fact it is pretty dire. Plusses and minuses below:-)Ludicrous editing.Horrendous continuity.The half-French, half-English mix is dreadful and there is no translation on the English subtitles.Mediocre performances by Thaw and Duncan.Dreadful performances by most of the 'supporting' cast - especially the English.What starts as a mildly interesting recount soon plummets into a villagehallesque type farce.The DVD hasn't been re-mastered, the quality looks washed-out, much more like watching a video cassette (if you can remember them)Lacks cohesion and a clear direction, intermittent narration seems like and afterthought and lacks authenticity.+)Great sceneryIt's sad to give this two stars, but it would be unfair to other products to bump-up the ratings for what are essentially nostalgic and (even worse) totally unrelated evaluation parameters.

Having read each several times over....and given many more away as gifts I was truly excited, yet apprehensive about making these &quot;jewels&quot; into a mini-series. Even with the BBC at the helm I was concerned about them maintaining the integrity of Mr. Mayle's novel's. So when they were released on PBS I held my breath... and waited for the worst.Well, I'm now breathing again! What a wonderful surprise! Peter and Annie,as portrayed by John Thaw and Lindsay Duncan, are marvelously captured in all of the glories that make up Provence and their stories have been reworked into screen format that make the books literally come to life. The series is visually stunning, the characters that we cared about so much in the books are vividly captured and in some cases even fleshed out better than in Mr. Mayle's novels. And where did they find these truly gifted French actors? I know,I know...in France! Well, there's simply not a bad apple in this barrell! As you can see from all these exclamation points I am very happy with the finished product. So happy that I actually purchased my very own copy on DVD. Something I simply wouldn't normally do! Oui!!The spirit of the books have remained intact and, especially Mr. Thaw, does a wonderful job of portraying &quot;innocent's abroad&quot; in each chapter, broken up as seasons in the series. An idea which I loved! And kudos go to director David Tucker for having the sense to give the film a true beginning by placing our protagonists in London,giving the series the feel of a new start for Peter and Annie and of the difference in existing cultures which was imperative for a film such as this to really work.Now, while some may see the series as being little more than an adult &quot;fairy tale&quot;, I simply tend to enjoy this for what it may be intended. A wonderful series about people searching for their own little paradise and finding it in the most peculiar places. In their own hearts. Enjoy!P.S.

340490,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,6302843065,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[2, 2]","Based on the best selling book ""A Year in Provence"" by Peter Mayle, this 4 part DVD set is a joyful and amusing celebration of life and cultural differences as experienced by Peter and Annie, two London based British professionals who decide to change lifestyles by moving to this quiet French wine-growing countryside. Their story is divided into four parts by the seasons of Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall during which their various experiences keep the viewer engaged and laughing as new developments arise in their adjustments to their adopted country. Many amusing characters both French and British arrive onto the scene as they remodel their 200 year old French stone farmhouse. They learn to adapt to French ways, such as truffle hunting, playing boule (petenque), and engaging in betting on a goat race. They have three separate British families staying as guests at their home, when Peter discovers he accidentally booked them all for the same weeks. In a good-natured manner, Annie and Peter become chefs, hoteliers, and tour guides and nearly wear themselves thin until one elderly bored guest gives Peter a hint and suggestion of how to return to their normal lives without offending anyone. Eventually, they even make wine from grapes harvested in their own vineyard. The culmination of their acceptance as locals is when Peter is selected to play ""Father Christmas"" for the town, the ex-Brit has become a full-fledged citizen of the Provencal.After a farewell party given for the Mayles by their friends and business associates, the Mayles trade in a London based corporate life for the French countryside of Provence. Their story begins with a gastronomical feast at Chez Raymond, a restaurant in the nearby village, where the couple eat their way through the many specialties and desserts offered by the chef/owner of this local establisment. It is a most appropriate way to begin their new life. However, their idyllic views are shattered by the strong winds of the ""les Mistral"", a wind that could last up to three weeks which comes in the winter. They also discover their heating pipes are frozen which results in a need for repairs and restructuring of pipes. There is a series of workmen, such as Mr Colombani, the plumber, followed by an electrician and his helper, a carpenter and assistant, and plasterer who are hired to remodel their kitchen but the work is done on an erratic schedule as they seem to accept as much work as possible and do not set a deadline to complete the job. The Mayles get a hint from the postman as to who is tying up the workmen when they visit Evelyn, a former Parisian who lives nearby. They become involved in a mystery of the cock named Charlemagne who keeps crowing very early every morning, awakening Evelyn and her houseguests and keeping them awake at odd hours of the night as well. There is another  mystery which arises that involves the Mayle's missing mailbox which is very funny to watch. Although, Charlemagne's behavior is deemed natural for a cock, the Mayle's discover Charlemagne's owner has another cunning reason for encouraging this natural phenomenon.Early on, the Mayles are introduced to their neighbor Mr. Rivier who provides them with a gift of a dead fox, which they finally understand was meant for Annie, from which to make a stew. It turns out Mr. Rivier has plans or dreams to sell his property at a high price to a British guest of theirs named Tony. Tony is a British guest who turns up out of the blue and is a friend of a friend they knew in London. Peter and Annie are highly tolerant people, but they have had enough of Tony and his ""executive crumpet"" Marion's behavior as they take advantage of the hospitality of these hosts. Peter deals with them in a most forthright manner. It turns out, Mr. Rivier engages in night treks through the vineyards of the Mayles, who eventually discover what he is up to. Mr Rivier is an elderly bachelor who surprisingly becomes the town hero by helping to save the local grammar school, which he does in a very creative manner. The grammar school teacher and local minister become engaged to be married, after the creative fund-raising event sponsored by the great example set by Mr Rivier. His example wins the support of the local townsfolk. The event is successful and raises enough money for the school to remain open. Overall, this is a highly entertaining and amusing collection of true-to-life stories and events in the lives of the Mayle's as they adapt to living in the Luberon Valley in Provence. This four part DVD set is one which I continue to watch over and over, feeling I am revisiting long lost friends each time I view them.

340503,A281NPSIMI1C2R,6302843065,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[75, 79]","When I first saw the title of this movie, I was intrigued. I wasn't looking for a movie about France, but any movie title with the word Provence has my attention. When I saw it was a TV comedy, I thought it might be a nice few hours escape. I also imagined it might have some Provence countryside and local flair.This movie starts out very slowly, so you have to be patient. In fact, I wasn't sure I had put in the right tape to start with, but soon I figured out what the movie was about. Peter (an advertising executive) and his wife who decide to quit their jobs in England and just run off to southern France. After buying a quaint farmhouse in Provence, they try to settle into the slow paced country life. This is a very laid back movie, and that is perhaps its charm.Food is also a theme in this movie. There are romantic restaurants and fun scenes of Peter going to the bakery to get a baguette for breakfast. There is a bit of drama with the bakery near the end of the movie.You will laugh out loud in some scenes as Peter is pulled along with a pig hunting for truffles. There is a ""truffle mystery theme"" running through the movie. The humor in this made-for-TV romantic comedy is dry English humor, which I quite enjoy. This is really more of a comedy, than a romance. Perhaps the romance is that a couple is trying to find their dream and they stick together through the good and the bad.What I loved was that Peter was a writer and he is always trying to finish his novel. His wife helps him on a writing assignment about Provence and that is when things turn more into a mystery.There is a good dose of the ""French language"" in this movie, but you always know what the actors are saying because Peter and his wife let you know. The cultural misunderstandings are very amusing, but trying in a way. Annie and Peter do attempt to fit in and learn as much French as they can.When they experience the good and the bad, it is then they appreciate France all the more. The ""mistral"" winds (strong winds) catch them off guard as they never imagined they would have to deal with a freezing cold environment. When the pipes freeze and they are expecting company, they end up starting a kitchen renovation, which takes forever to complete.To top it all off, people keep dropping in unexpectedly and expect to be entertained. While they enjoy the company of ""real friends,"" they do attempt to get rid of a summer guest only to have him make a choice they are not happy with. The situations these two characters get themselves into are quite funny. They also meet up with quite a few interesting characters, those being the local residents.I do wish they had shown more of the Provenal countryside and lifestyle, but it was entertaining. I have always thought it would be fun to live in France and be a writer. This movie was entertaining in that regard. I would also love to live in that house with a pool! What a life! If you enjoy English humor, which is very dry...you will love it! If you love Provence, France, this is a rare treat.~The Rebecca Review",4,Tarte Tatin and Truffles,978652800,"01 5, 2001",2001,3060,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'title', 'movie', 'was', 'intrigued', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'movie', 'France', 'movie', 'title', 'word', 'Provence', 'attention', 'When', 'saw', 'was', 'TV', 'comedy', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'nice', 'few', 'hours', 'escape', 'also', 'imagined', 'might', 'have', 'Provence', 'countryside', 'local', 'flair.This', 'movie', 'out', 'very', 'slowly', 'have', 'be', 'patient', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'had', 'put', 'right', 'tape', 'start', 'soon', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'Peter', 'advertising', 'executive', 'wife', 'who', 'decide', 'quit', 'jobs', 'England', 'just', 'run', 'off', 'southern', 'France', 'buying', 'quaint', 'farmhouse', 'Provence', 'try', 'settle', 'slow', 'paced', 'country', 'life', 'very', 'laid', 'back', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'charm.Food', 'also', 'theme', 'movie', 'are', 'romantic', 'restaurants', 'fun', 'scenes', 'Peter', 'going', 'bakery', 'get', 'baguette', 'breakfast', 'bit', 'drama', 'bakery', 'end', 'movie.You', 'will', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'scenes', 'Peter', 'pulled', 'along', 'pig', 'hunting', 'truffles', 'truffle', 'mystery', 'theme', 'running', 'movie', 'humor', 'made-for-TV', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'dry', 'English', 'humor', 'quite', 'enjoy', 'really', 'more', 'comedy', 'romance', 'Perhaps', 'romance', 'couple', 'trying', 'find', 'dream', 'stick', 'together', 'good', 'bad.What', 'loved', 'was', 'Peter', 'was', 'writer', 'always', 'trying', 'finish', 'novel', 'wife', 'writing', 'assignment', 'Provence', 'when', 'things', 'turn', 'more', 'mystery.There', 'good', 'dose', 'French', 'language', 'movie', 'always', 'know', 'what', 'actors', 'are', 'saying', 'Peter', 'wife', 'let', 'know', 'cultural', 'misunderstandings', 'are', 'very', 'amusing', 'trying', 'way', 'Annie', 'Peter', 'do', 'attempt', 'fit', 'learn', 'as', 'much', 'French', 'can.When', 'experience', 'good', 'bad', 'then', 'appreciate', 'France', 'more', 'mistral', 'winds', 'strong', 'winds', 'catch', 'off', 'guard', 'never', 'imagined', 'would', 'have', 'deal', 'freezing', 'cold', 'environment', 'When', 'pipes', 'freeze', 'are', 'expecting', 'company', 'end', 'up', 'starting', 'kitchen', 'renovation', 'forever', 'complete.To', 'top', 'off', 'people', 'keep', 'dropping', 'unexpectedly', 'expect', 'be', 'entertained', 'enjoy', 'company', 'real', 'friends', 'do', 'attempt', 'get', 'rid', 'summer', 'guest', 'only', 'have', 'make', 'choice', 'are', 'not', 'happy', 'situations', 'two', 'characters', 'get', 'are', 'quite', 'funny', 'also', 'meet', 'up', 'quite', 'few', 'interesting', 'characters', 'being', 'local', 'residents.I', 'do', 'wish', 'had', 'shown', 'more', 'Provenal', 'countryside', 'lifestyle', 'was', 'entertaining', 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'live', 'France', 'be', 'writer', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'regard', 'would', 'also', 'love', 'live', 'house', 'pool', 'What', 'life', 'enjoy', 'English', 'humor', 'very', 'dry', 'will', 'love', 'love', 'Provence', 'France', 'rare', 'treat.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

Peter Mayle's A Year in Provence is good, but the screenplay made a few important changes that made all the difference.The addition of a wife for Mayle is the main difference. While Mayle has a wife in the book, she fades so far into the background as to be virtually invisible. I see from the dedication in the book that her name is Jenny, but since the screenwriter had to create a wife out of whole cloth here, he gave her a new name as well -- Annie. The addition of Annie and the casting of Lindsay Crouse make all the difference.Another difference was to subtract ex-spouses and grown children, which serves to streamline the story. Peter in the film is somewhat more short-tempered and loud than Peter in the book, but this makes a nice contrast with Annie. And who is going to make himself out to be a blowhard in his own book, after all? The rest of the story is much as Mayle wrote it.This set has become one of our family favorites. We borrowed the public library's copies several times, then finally bought our own and watch it at least once a year. It's broken down into twelve 30-minute chapters, one for each month. You can watch it in half hour chunks or 90-minute doses, a whole season (and tape) at a time. The chapters stand alone, but are also threaded together to make a real story. In fact, the story comes together so neatly, that one suspects that although these episodes may really have happened, perhaps they happened over a period of several years, or in a different order. Still, some of the best non-fiction writers out there are novelists at heart.The acting and the scenery in A Year in Provence are just great. The French characters are played by French actors and speak no English in the film. Since the Mayles are learning French, they are able to translate for us and it doesn't seem awkward.There you have it: entertaining writing, good acting, gorgeous scenery, and a free French lesson thrown in.",5,Better Than the Book!,1072828800,"12 31, 2003",2003,2034,"['4-video', 'set', 'one', 'rare', 'birds', 'adaptation', 'better', 'then', 'original', 'book', 'Peter', 'Mayle', 'Year', 'Provence', 'good', 'screenplay', 'made', 'few', 'important', 'changes', 'made', 'difference.The', 'addition', 'wife', 'Mayle', 'main', 'difference', 'Mayle', 'wife', 'book', 'so', 'far', 'background', 'be', 'virtually', 'invisible', 'see', 'dedication', 'book', 'name', 'Jenny', 'screenwriter', 'had', 'create', 'wife', 'whole', 'cloth', 'here', 'gave', 'new', 'name', 'as', 'well', 'Annie', 'addition', 'Annie', 'casting', 'Lindsay', 'Crouse', 'make', 'difference.Another', 'difference', 'was', 'subtract', 'ex-spouses', 'grown', 'children', 'streamline', 'story', 'Peter', 'film', 'somewhat', 'more', 'short-tempered', 'loud', 'Peter', 'book', 'nice', 'contrast', 'Annie', 'who', 'going', 'make', 'be', 'blowhard', 'own', 'book', 'rest', 'story', 'much', 'Mayle', 'wrote', 'it.This', 'set', 'become', 'one', 'family', 'borrowed', 'public', 'library', 'copies', 'several', 'times', 'then', 'finally', 'bought', 'own', 'watch', 'least', 'once', 'year', 'broken', 'down', 'twelve', '30-minute', 'chapters', 'one', 'month', 'can', 'watch', 'half', 'hour', 'chunks', '90-minute', 'doses', 'whole', 'season', 'tape', 'time', 'chapters', 'stand', 'alone', 'are', 'also', 'threaded', 'together', 'make', 'real', 'story', 'fact', 'story', 'together', 'so', 'neatly', 'one', 'episodes', 'may', 'really', 'have', 'happened', 'perhaps', 'happened', 'over', 'period', 'several', 'years', 'different', 'order', 'Still', 'best', 'non-fiction', 'writers', 'are', 'novelists', 'heart.The', 'acting', 'scenery', 'Year', 'Provence', 'are', 'just', 'great', 'French', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'French', 'actors', 'speak', 'English', 'film', 'Mayles', 'are', 'learning', 'French', 'are', 'able', 'translate', ""n't"", 'seem', 'awkward.There', 'have', 'entertaining', 'writing', 'good', 'acting', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'free', 'French', 'lesson', 'thrown']",N/A
340509,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,6302843065,"Tiggah ""the Anglophile""","[98, 99]","A Year in Provence is a thoroughly enjoyable, witty, humorous series starring the late John Thaw (Inspector Morse, Kavanagh QC), who sadly died of throat cancer in 2002.  The series is based on the real-life experiences of Peter Mayle and his wife who left their jobs and lives in England to move to the south of France.  Mayle's intention was to settle in this idyllic corner of paradise to write a novel; what resulted was a memoir which served as the basis for this splendid series.Beginning in winter, the series covers the Mayles' first year in Provence and dramatises the many trials and tribulations they faced in adjusting to the local customs and peculiarities (like goat racing and truffle hunting) and to their new environment.  There were the gale-force winter winds (""les Mistrals"") to contend with; added to that, the lovely, rustic old farmhouse they bought came complete (alas) with inadequate insulation, frozen water pipes, and no central heating!  While the laid-back, lazy lifestyle may have been an attraction when the Mayles were in England, they soon learn it has its drawbacks when it comes to getting anything done--like the much-needed repairs and renovations by the builders!  Then there's the joy of entertaining visitors from back home, the pleasure of which is somewhat dimmed when they find they've inadvertently overlapped the visits of three couples.The series has been presented in a boxed set of four 90-minute episodes--one for each season from Winter through Autumn.  Each episode is broken down into three 30-minute parts--one for each month of the season.  Though we chose to watch the series in its 90-minute blocks, one could easily watch it in half-hour blocks if one preferred.In conclusion, I highly, highly recommend this delightful series to anyone who enjoys British entertainment in general.  I'm extremely glad I took a chance on this set as it's been a series our whole family has really enjoyed watching (and one we look forward to watching again in the not-too-distant future).  I might just mention (in case it's not obvious!) that one ought not to expect any heavy drama or an action-packed, intricately plotted series here.  This is simply not that kind of show.  In fact, I'd have to say that really belongs in a genre all its own.  It is a nice clean, relaxing show with no sex, violence or bad language--just a plethora of entertaining and often hilarious incidents set against the pastoral backdrop of the gorgeous Provencal landscape.  Just perfect (in my opinion) for unwinding at the end of the day!",5,An Absolute Treasure!,1043625600,"01 27, 2003",2003,2561,"['Year', 'Provence', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'witty', 'humorous', 'series', 'starring', 'late', 'John', 'Thaw', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'Kavanagh', 'QC', 'who', 'sadly', 'died', 'throat', 'cancer', '2002', 'series', 'based', 'real-life', 'experiences', 'Peter', 'Mayle', 'wife', 'who', 'left', 'jobs', 'lives', 'England', 'move', 'south', 'France', 'Mayle', 'intention', 'was', 'settle', 'idyllic', 'corner', 'paradise', 'write', 'novel', 'what', 'resulted', 'was', 'memoir', 'served', 'basis', 'splendid', 'series.Beginning', 'winter', 'series', 'Mayles', 'first', 'year', 'Provence', 'many', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'faced', 'adjusting', 'local', 'customs', 'peculiarities', 'goat', 'racing', 'truffle', 'hunting', 'new', 'environment', 'were', 'gale-force', 'winter', 'winds', 'Mistrals', 'contend', 'added', 'lovely', 'rustic', 'old', 'farmhouse', 'bought', 'came', 'complete', 'alas', 'inadequate', 'insulation', 'frozen', 'water', 'pipes', 'central', 'heating', 'laid-back', 'lazy', 'lifestyle', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'attraction', 'when', 'Mayles', 'were', 'England', 'soon', 'learn', 'drawbacks', 'when', 'getting', 'anything', 'done', 'much-needed', 'repairs', 'renovations', 'builders', 'Then', 'joy', 'entertaining', 'visitors', 'back', 'home', 'pleasure', 'somewhat', 'dimmed', 'when', 'find', ""'ve"", 'inadvertently', 'overlapped', 'visits', 'three', 'couples.The', 'series', 'been', 'presented', 'boxed', 'set', 'four', '90-minute', 'episodes', 'one', 'season', 'Winter', 'Autumn', 'episode', 'broken', 'down', 'three', '30-minute', 'parts', 'one', 'month', 'season', 'chose', 'watch', 'series', '90-minute', 'blocks', 'one', 'could', 'easily', 'watch', 'half-hour', 'blocks', 'one', 'preferred.In', 'conclusion', 'highly', 'highly', 'recommend', 'delightful', 'series', 'anyone', 'who', 'British', 'entertainment', 'general', ""'m"", 'extremely', 'glad', 'took', 'chance', 'set', 'been', 'series', 'whole', 'family', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'one', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'again', 'not-too-distant', 'future', 'might', 'just', 'mention', 'case', 'not', 'obvious', 'one', 'ought', 'not', 'expect', 'heavy', 'drama', 'action-packed', 'intricately', 'plotted', 'series', 'here', 'simply', 'not', 'kind', 'show', 'fact', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'really', 'genre', 'own', 'nice', 'clean', 'relaxing', 'show', 'sex', 'violence', 'bad', 'language', 'just', 'plethora', 'entertaining', 'often', 'hilarious', 'incidents', 'set', 'pastoral', 'backdrop', 'gorgeous', 'Provencal', 'landscape', 'Just', 'perfect', 'opinion', 'unwinding', 'end', 'day']",N/A
