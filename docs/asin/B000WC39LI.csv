1108243,A2J6AMNSPJ8G2,B000WC39LI,DJ Siniestro,"[1, 2]","The first three American PieAmerican Pie 3 Movie Pie Pack: The Franchise Collection (Unrated)humorously told tales of relationships and coming of age.  Those movies also had some nudity (mostly) for comedic effect. In contrast, these spiritual sequels have nudity with a plotline (mostly) for comedic effect. With plot holes  so big you can drive a truck through them and incredibly unfunny , it is obvious why the three last movies were released straight to DVDs.When rating a product, I don't normally assign a grade based only on the movie itself. That is what movies reviews are for. For a rating, I'll look at things like extras, DVD packaging, features, etc. This DVD set is very rich in those areas; the problem is that the movies that these extras pertain to are horrible and borderline retarded.My biggest frustration is that they have the American Pie banner, which led me to believe these movies would be on par with the originals. Totally devoid of charisma, there's no real reason to buy this set unless you are into bad movies. Although admittedly each movie has the occasional funny moments, sitting through ninety minutes of crap for two jokes is not worth your time or money.",1,Terrible Movies for a Good Price!,1282176000,"08 19, 2010",2010,1192,"['first', 'three', 'American', 'PieAmerican', 'Pie', '3', 'Movie', 'Pie', 'Pack', 'Franchise', 'Collection', 'Unrated', 'humorously', 'told', 'tales', 'relationships', 'coming', 'age', 'movies', 'also', 'had', 'nudity', 'mostly', 'comedic', 'effect', 'contrast', 'spiritual', 'sequels', 'have', 'nudity', 'plotline', 'mostly', 'comedic', 'effect', 'plot', 'holes', 'so', 'big', 'can', 'drive', 'truck', 'incredibly', 'unfunny', 'obvious', 'why', 'three', 'last', 'movies', 'were', 'released', 'straight', 'DVDs.When', 'rating', 'product', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'assign', 'grade', 'based', 'only', 'movie', 'what', 'movies', 'reviews', 'are', 'rating', ""'ll"", 'look', 'things', 'extras', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'features', 'etc', 'DVD', 'set', 'very', 'rich', 'areas', 'problem', 'movies', 'extras', 'pertain', 'are', 'horrible', 'borderline', 'retarded.My', 'biggest', 'frustration', 'have', 'American', 'Pie', 'banner', 'led', 'believe', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'par', 'originals', 'Totally', 'devoid', 'charisma', 'real', 'reason', 'buy', 'set', 'are', 'bad', 'movies', 'admittedly', 'movie', 'occasional', 'funny', 'moments', 'sitting', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'crap', 'two', 'jokes', 'not', 'worth', 'time', 'money']",American Pie Presents: The Threesome Pack (Band Camp / The Naked Mile / Beta House)

They are just the same plot about going to college, getting laid, getting drunk, etc. The only thing they do to make it like the originals is get Eugene Levy to be Jim's dad for a 5 minute cameo.
