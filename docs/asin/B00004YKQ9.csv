559220,A1H0CWFQY2HFGG,B00004YKQ9,"Bud Bundy ""B movie lover""","[6, 6]","Typical tale of witchcraft, some college kids dig up a few corpses (to identify the DNA), the witch takes over their bodies and turns the rest into ghouls.  A few are left to fight against her, helped out by a mysterious guy who knows the secret of the witch.  But none of that really matters.I don't mind if somebody wants to rip off the hand-held camcorder style of Blair Witch, but puh-leeze, let there be some reason for it.  Not only is there no reason for it here, but all the scenes which might have been in the movie - the ones which advance the plot and flesh out the characters - have been jettisoned in favor of having the college kids do a bunch of utterly pointless interviews, which gives them an excuse to use a camcorder.  This is as rancid as film making gets.Just when I thought I'd had all I could take of pointless camcorder footage, along comes a solid quarter hour of camcorder footage, just interviewing random citizens that live in this town, most of it done for comic relief I guess.  Though it wasn't funny.  I put the DVD player on 8X fast forward and it still took several minutes to get through it.Then we get to go through a house as viewed through the camcorder - with the low battery light blinking the entire time.  Everyone acts really really scared, until they find the ghouls.  Then they aren't scared any more.  Apparently they filmed these scenes on different days and nobody bothered to remember that they were acting scared in the previous scene.Lest I forget, the main character is completely obnoxious.  You'll be rooting for him do die in the most gruesome way.  He lives.  The other characters are utterly banal.I normally enjoy Full Moon pictures, they usually have a very original plot and make the most of their minuscule budgets.  However, director J.R. Bookwalter has no use for originality - he's one of those people who look at what has made money for other people and then tries to copy it.  It's people like him that are the reason Hollywood sucks as bad as it does, and now it looks like Full Moon pictures is going in that direction as well.  He also manages to get the worst performances possible out of his actors.Avoid this thing like the plague.",1,Horrendously bad and annoying,1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,2204,"['Typical', 'tale', 'witchcraft', 'college', 'kids', 'dig', 'up', 'few', 'corpses', 'identify', 'DNA', 'witch', 'over', 'bodies', 'rest', 'ghouls', 'few', 'are', 'left', 'fight', 'helped', 'out', 'mysterious', 'guy', 'who', 'secret', 'witch', 'none', 'really', 'matters.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'somebody', 'rip', 'off', 'hand-held', 'camcorder', 'style', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'puh-leeze', 'let', 'be', 'reason', 'Not', 'only', 'there', 'reason', 'here', 'scenes', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'ones', 'advance', 'plot', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'jettisoned', 'favor', 'having', 'college', 'kids', 'do', 'bunch', 'utterly', 'pointless', 'interviews', 'excuse', 'use', 'camcorder', 'as', 'rancid', 'film', 'making', 'gets.Just', 'when', 'thought', ""'d"", 'had', 'could', 'take', 'pointless', 'camcorder', 'footage', 'solid', 'quarter', 'hour', 'camcorder', 'footage', 'just', 'interviewing', 'random', 'citizens', 'live', 'town', 'most', 'done', 'comic', 'relief', 'guess', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'put', 'DVD', 'player', '8X', 'fast', 'forward', 'still', 'took', 'several', 'minutes', 'get', 'it.Then', 'get', 'go', 'house', 'viewed', 'camcorder', 'low', 'battery', 'light', 'blinking', 'entire', 'time', 'Everyone', 'really', 'really', 'scared', 'find', 'ghouls', 'Then', 'are', ""n't"", 'scared', 'more', 'Apparently', 'filmed', 'scenes', 'different', 'days', 'nobody', 'bothered', 'remember', 'were', 'acting', 'scared', 'previous', 'scene.Lest', 'forget', 'main', 'character', 'completely', 'obnoxious', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rooting', 'do', 'die', 'most', 'gruesome', 'way', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'utterly', 'banal.I', 'normally', 'enjoy', 'Full', 'Moon', 'pictures', 'usually', 'have', 'very', 'original', 'plot', 'make', 'most', 'minuscule', 'budgets', 'However', 'director', 'J.R.', 'Bookwalter', 'use', 'originality', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'look', 'what', 'made', 'money', 'other', 'people', 'then', 'tries', 'copy', 'people', 'are', 'reason', 'Hollywood', 'sucks', 'as', 'bad', 'now', 'Full', 'Moon', 'pictures', 'going', 'direction', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'get', 'worst', 'performances', 'possible', 'actors.Avoid', 'thing', 'plague']",N/A

I very much so liked the first Witchouse, and was hoping this would follow the same kind of story line.  Unfortunatley, the director of this installment didn't have the same idea in mind.

Met with hostility by the town, they discover four graves on the murder site, and then must unlock that mystery as well.While the movie has the fun energy level and cheesy special effects that we've come to know and love from Full Moon, this story has more plot holes than cohesive plot threads. For example, in Witchouse, Lilith LeFey was brought back to live of the 300 year anniversary of her murder. However, This movie gives the date of her death as 1826. the math doesn't hold up. The ending, also, gave me a massive headache. I was left staring at the screen and wondering what the heck happened. It just didn't make sense and didn't flow with the rest of the film. Also, the dead Goth teens are what brought the team to town are mentioned only in the beginning and then ignored for the last hour of film.My only other complaint involves part of the film's style. This came out right after the first Blair Witch film, so large chunks of this film are shown only through a home video camera, in a parody of the other film's style. Full Moon is best when it's original, not when it's copying someone else.Yes, there are better horror films and there are many horror movies that are much, much worse.
