This is a nice little documentary about the fight of one girl to obtain comprehensive sex education in her school district and, along the way, obtain the right of gay students to not be discriminated against.Shelby Knox is, in many ways, the embodiment of our wonderful American teenagers. She earnestly cares about fairness and equality. Shelby lives in a city with one of the highest teen pregnancy rates in the country and she wants her friends and schoolmates to be given proper education and facts about sex and sexual consequences in order that they be prepared for their future lives. She also hurts, genuinely, to see the gay students at her school openly discriminated against. Shelby is not, herself, gay or sexually active, but she recognizes unfairness when she sees it and she obviously has a passion for righting wrongs. She is also, like most teenagers, blessed with an ounce of self-centeredness which buoys her in times of trial and setbacks.Shelby does not succeed in her quest - through no fault of her own, I might add - but she fails with grace and dignity. She excels in spite of small-town judgmental attitudes that judge her suspiciously for her activism and her associations. She flourishes in spite of a home life that, in my humble opinion, seems unfortunately authoritarian - her parents regularly discourage her (overtly and subversively) against her activism, particularly with regards to gay rights. They sort of come around in the end to put on a good face, but in my opinion their lack of enthusiastic support for their giving, caring daughter is very stifling.This isn't your usual documentary. There are almost no experts interviewed, which I feel would have been a huge bonus to the enterprise, and would have warranted five stars. This is, instead the story of one young woman's crusade, as it happened. Although the editing can be a bit sloppy at times, I recommend this documentary, if only for the bits involving the True Love Waits pastor and his wonderful speech in which he successfully leaves students with the impression that you can get AIDS merely from shaking someone's hand. Ah, American education at its finest.I do not own this movie - I rented this through my Blockbuster Online account.",4,"Who says young people don't ""care""?",1232409600,"01 20, 2009",2009,2427,"['Education', 'Shelby', 'Knox', '/', 'B000GG4XYC*Spoilers*I', 'love', 'documentaries', 'probably', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'as', 'soon', 'heard', 'Education', 'Shelby', 'Knox', 'had', 'rush', 'out', 'rent', 'nice', 'little', 'documentary', 'fight', 'one', 'girl', 'obtain', 'comprehensive', 'sex', 'education', 'school', 'district', 'way', 'obtain', 'right', 'gay', 'students', 'not', 'be', 'discriminated', 'against.Shelby', 'Knox', 'many', 'ways', 'embodiment', 'wonderful', 'American', 'teenagers', 'earnestly', 'fairness', 'equality', 'Shelby', 'city', 'one', 'highest', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'rates', 'country', 'friends', 'schoolmates', 'be', 'given', 'proper', 'education', 'facts', 'sex', 'sexual', 'consequences', 'order', 'be', 'prepared', 'future', 'also', 'genuinely', 'see', 'gay', 'students', 'school', 'openly', 'discriminated', 'Shelby', 'not', 'sexually', 'active', 'unfairness', 'when', 'obviously', 'passion', 'righting', 'wrongs', 'also', 'most', 'teenagers', 'blessed', 'ounce', 'self-centeredness', 'times', 'trial', 'setbacks.Shelby', 'not', 'succeed', 'quest', 'fault', 'own', 'might', 'add', 'grace', 'dignity', 'spite', 'small-town', 'judgmental', 'attitudes', 'judge', 'suspiciously', 'activism', 'associations', 'spite', 'home', 'life', 'humble', 'opinion', 'unfortunately', 'authoritarian', 'parents', 'regularly', 'discourage', 'overtly', 'subversively', 'activism', 'particularly', 'regards', 'gay', 'rights', 'sort', 'come', 'end', 'put', 'good', 'face', 'opinion', 'lack', 'enthusiastic', 'support', 'giving', 'caring', 'daughter', 'very', 'stifling.This', ""n't"", 'usual', 'documentary', 'are', 'almost', 'experts', 'interviewed', 'feel', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'bonus', 'enterprise', 'would', 'have', 'warranted', 'five', 'stars', 'instead', 'story', 'one', 'young', 'woman', 'crusade', 'happened', 'editing', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'sloppy', 'times', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'only', 'bits', 'involving', 'True', 'Love', 'Waits', 'pastor', 'wonderful', 'speech', 'successfully', 'students', 'impression', 'can', 'get', 'AIDS', 'merely', 'shaking', 'someone', 'hand', 'Ah', 'American', 'education', 'finest.I', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'movie', 'rented', 'Blockbuster', 'Online', 'account']",The Education of Shelby Knox
1003672,A3CTNILCZ3U2LG,B000GG4XYC,"Barry Hampe ""Author: 'Making Documentary Film...","[0, 0]","Like every true revolutionary, Shelby Knox, a tenth grader in Lubbock, Texas, just started out to do something she thought was right. The Lubbock schools offered no sex education beyond advocating abstinence before marriage. And, although Shelby had taken a pledge of chastity until marriage at her church, she couldn't overlook the fact that many of her classmates were getting pregnant. As a member of the city youth council, she proposed adding true sex education to the curriculum.And that put her in direct conflict with the superintendent of schools, the school board, and her own pastor. Her parents, conservative, Southern Baptist Republicans, while clearly wishing she had not taken on this cause, supported her right to do so. Toward the end of the film they show their support by joining her in a demonstration favoring a cause they clearly would rather not endorse. Covering three years in Shelby's life, this excellent documentary by Marion Lipschutz and Rose Rosenblatt, digs hard for the visual evidence to tell the story of a determined young woman.Writer and filmmaker Barry Hampe is doing research for a new book on Filming Behavior.

The film focuses on three years in the life of Shelby Knox a Lubbuck, Texas teen as she fights for sex education in her school district.Shelby Knox knew that the abstinence only policy of her school district was not working. Lubbuck has one of the highest teen pregnancy and teen STD rates in the country. As the newly elected member of the Lubbuck Youth Commission she tries to tackle sex education head on. We see her struggles with her peers, her community, her pastor, her parents and herself as she tries to reconcile her strict Southern Baptist beliefs with the world she lives in.This is the rare documentary that gives an honest portrait of someone who is trying to make a difference. The struggles may not always provide the results that are hoped for but they do help to build a better world. Knox through her convictions grows as a person and as a citizen.This is the type of film that if seen by more people would really make a difference.

1003674,A391RY3TA1MCVM,B000GG4XYC,David Ljunggren,"[1, 1]","Shelby Knox is a precocious and motivated teenager in the religious and conservative stronghold of Lubbock, Texas, who begins to increasingly question the school board's policy of not teaching sex education. There is good reason to express doubts: Lubbock has the highest rate of teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases in the state. Knox joins a commission of school pupils which takes on the topic and is swatted aside by the authorities. We meet the town preacher, who tells students they will suffer all sorts of torments unless they stay virgins until they get married. Knox, supported at first by her rather baffled Republican parents, starts asking all sorts of pointed questions which the school board and other adults doesn't want to hear. What is the point of sticking to an abstinence-only policy when it has clearly failed? What about the gay youth movement? Shouldn't they have rights in school too? In one-jaw dropping moment, the commission of pupils discusses gay rights, and one teenage girl solemnly announces that as far as she knows, homosexuals have all sorts of problems and rarely live beyond the age 40.My problem with this film is that a lot of it comes across as staged and awkward. I don't deny Knox must have had these exchanges with her parents and the preacher, but to my eye a lot of them have been recreated for the camera. The more documentaries I watch the more I realise they are a work or art as much as a portrayal of what you're (supposed to be) seeing and this film comes across as very clunky, as though the makers came across the story late in the day and had to start over. It's definitely worth watching though.",3,"Interesting idea, but comes across as very staged",1365379200,"04 8, 2013",2013,1663,"['Shelby', 'Knox', 'precocious', 'motivated', 'teenager', 'religious', 'conservative', 'stronghold', 'Lubbock', 'Texas', 'who', 'increasingly', 'question', 'school', 'board', 'policy', 'not', 'teaching', 'sex', 'education', 'good', 'reason', 'express', 'doubts', 'Lubbock', 'highest', 'rate', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'sexually', 'transmitted', 'diseases', 'state', 'Knox', 'commission', 'school', 'pupils', 'topic', 'swatted', 'aside', 'authorities', 'meet', 'town', 'preacher', 'who', 'students', 'will', 'suffer', 'sorts', 'torments', 'stay', 'virgins', 'get', 'married', 'Knox', 'supported', 'first', 'rather', 'baffled', 'Republican', 'parents', 'asking', 'sorts', 'pointed', 'questions', 'school', 'board', 'other', 'adults', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'What', 'point', 'sticking', 'abstinence-only', 'policy', 'when', 'clearly', 'failed', 'What', 'gay', 'youth', 'movement', 'Should', ""n't"", 'have', 'rights', 'school', 'too', 'one-jaw', 'dropping', 'moment', 'commission', 'pupils', 'discusses', 'gay', 'rights', 'one', 'teenage', 'girl', 'solemnly', 'as', 'far', 'homosexuals', 'have', 'sorts', 'problems', 'rarely', 'live', 'age', '40.My', 'problem', 'film', 'lot', 'staged', 'awkward', 'do', ""n't"", 'deny', 'Knox', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'exchanges', 'parents', 'preacher', 'eye', 'lot', 'have', 'been', 'recreated', 'camera', 'more', 'documentaries', 'watch', 'more', 'realise', 'are', 'work', 'art', 'as', 'much', 'portrayal', 'what', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'seeing', 'film', 'very', 'clunky', 'makers', 'came', 'story', 'late', 'day', 'had', 'start', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching']",The Education of Shelby Knox

Her fantasy boyfriend would be a fellow Broadways actor in Phantom of the Opera.  She's never seen a condom or a penis (she guessed condoms might be black in color).  She respects the pastor to whom she made her True Love Waits pledge, but she firmly believes that the church shouldn't be dictating the school's abstinence-only sex education platform.The documentary is the story of Shelby's crusade to change sex education in her hometown of Lubbock, TX, which suffers astronomically high rates of teen pregnancy and STD transmission.  Throughout the course of the movie, we watch Shelby mature from an outspoken and passionate high school sophomore to a confident, eloquent, convicted junior who is unafraid of even the most entrenched opponents.  When a values coalition leader threatens to use his power to fire any city official who works with Shelby, and then tells Shelby not to undermine her own religious morality, she puts him in his place and firmly tells him not to question her personal relationship with God.Shelby comes from a dedicated Republican father and compassionate Christian mother.  Their order of priorities is God, Family, Country.  Shelby does much soul searching during her campaign, talking with her pastor about her religion and its place in her school, as well as quizzing him on the church's stance on gays.  By the end of the film, Shelby emerges as a fierce Democrat who has convinced her Republican parents of the importance of sex education but can't get them to budge on gay rights.  This is as much the story of religion's hold on Lubbock as it is the making of a political activist.  Shelby Knox reminds us all to act with passion about the issues close to our hearts.",5,A thought-provoking and inspiring documentary about the making of a politically-savvy modern citizen,1182124800,"06 18, 2007",2007,2064,"['Life', 'Lubbock', 'TX', 'taught', 'two', 'things', 'one', 'God', ""'re"", 'going', 'burn', 'hell', 'other', 'sex', 'most', 'awful', 'filthy', 'thing', 'Earth', 'should', 'save', 'someone', 'love', 'Attributed', 'Butch', 'Hancock', 'Flatlanders.Shelby', 'Knox', 'made', 'purity', 'pledge', 'age', '16', 'just', 'good', 'Southern', 'Baptist', 'Texas', 'fantasy', 'boyfriend', 'would', 'be', 'fellow', 'Broadways', 'actor', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'never', 'seen', 'condom', 'penis', 'guessed', 'condoms', 'might', 'be', 'black', 'color', 'pastor', 'whom', 'made', 'True', 'Love', 'Waits', 'pledge', 'firmly', 'church', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'dictating', 'school', 'abstinence-only', 'sex', 'education', 'platform.The', 'documentary', 'story', 'Shelby', 'crusade', 'change', 'sex', 'education', 'hometown', 'Lubbock', 'TX', 'astronomically', 'high', 'rates', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'STD', 'transmission', 'course', 'movie', 'watch', 'Shelby', 'mature', 'outspoken', 'passionate', 'high', 'school', 'sophomore', 'confident', 'eloquent', 'convicted', 'junior', 'who', 'unafraid', 'even', 'most', 'entrenched', 'opponents', 'When', 'values', 'coalition', 'leader', 'use', 'power', 'fire', 'city', 'official', 'who', 'Shelby', 'then', 'tells', 'Shelby', 'not', 'undermine', 'own', 'religious', 'morality', 'place', 'firmly', 'tells', 'not', 'question', 'personal', 'relationship', 'God.Shelby', 'dedicated', 'Republican', 'father', 'compassionate', 'Christian', 'mother', 'order', 'priorities', 'God', 'Family', 'Country', 'Shelby', 'much', 'soul', 'searching', 'campaign', 'talking', 'pastor', 'religion', 'place', 'school', 'as', 'well', 'quizzing', 'church', 'stance', 'gays', 'end', 'film', 'Shelby', 'fierce', 'Democrat', 'who', 'convinced', 'Republican', 'parents', 'importance', 'sex', 'education', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'budge', 'gay', 'rights', 'as', 'much', 'story', 'religion', 'hold', 'Lubbock', 'making', 'political', 'activist', 'Shelby', 'Knox', 'act', 'passion', 'issues', 'close', 'hearts']",The Education of Shelby Knox
