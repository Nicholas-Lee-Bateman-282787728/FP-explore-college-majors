379991,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303566685,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","So, the comment section of my `Forrest Gump' review has been abuzz lately with criticisms of me calling 1994 a subpar year in general for film.  I'm not going to get into that here, but I found it rather ironic that that was sparked in the recent days, since I've been brushing up on films from 1994 recently and have become more and more convinced that my original assessment was correct.  There are a lot of good films that came out in that particular year, but not a lot of truly great ones.With that in mind, I just got done watching one small film that I do feel is great, possibly one of the best of the year, and so this is for you Beany.James Gray is one of those directors that has a pretty loyal fanbase.  He's only directed five films, one of them not released yet, and yet his style and atmospheric presence has attained him a cult following.  His dedication to the crime drama (diverting lately with his last two films) has formulated a niche for him that many find alluring and commanding.  I really liked both `We Own the Night' and `Two Lovers' (I haven't seen `The Yards') and yet I was bewildered a tad by his fans because neither film struck me as anything remarkable.`Little Odessa' is a different story.This debut film from Gray paints a bleak and grungy picture of the crime underbelly and the ways it leeches onto a particular family and tears them apart.  Joshua, the black sheep of the family, has disappeared for some time and is working for the Russian mob.  Called back to his hometown for a job, he reunites with his younger brother Reuben and finds himself at odds with his domineering and disapproving father.  With his mother on her deathbed, and his presence causing a stir with some local thugs, Joshua attempts to bond with his brother and say his goodbyes to his mother, all the while keeping a low profile and cleaning up a messy job.It doesn't work out as he planned.Gray established such tone with this film, creating a lingering tension that permeates every scene.  The cast is very good here, with Tim Roth nailing not only an accent but also the stern accountability and cold swagger his character has to exude.  Vanessa Redgrave is also very good, especially with the physicality of her role, but it is Maximilian Schell who was the brightest surprise here.  The way he handles his depiction of the father, Arkady, was flawless.  Such pent up frustration and anger and such calloused pain and internal suffering.  He balanced out each aspect of his character's development with sharp understanding and control.So, for a year that produced very little to get overly excited over, `Little Odessa' proved to be a staggering surprise and a true gem of a film!",5,Grit just pours off of every frame...,1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,2698,"['So', 'comment', 'section', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'review', 'been', 'abuzz', 'lately', 'criticisms', 'calling', '1994', 'subpar', 'year', 'general', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'get', 'here', 'found', 'rather', 'was', 'sparked', 'recent', 'days', ""'ve"", 'been', 'brushing', 'up', 'films', '1994', 'recently', 'have', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'convinced', 'original', 'assessment', 'was', 'correct', 'are', 'lot', 'good', 'films', 'came', 'out', 'particular', 'year', 'not', 'lot', 'truly', 'great', 'ones.With', 'mind', 'just', 'got', 'done', 'watching', 'one', 'small', 'film', 'do', 'feel', 'great', 'possibly', 'one', 'best', 'year', 'so', 'Beany.James', 'Gray', 'one', 'directors', 'pretty', 'loyal', 'fanbase', 'only', 'directed', 'five', 'films', 'one', 'not', 'released', 'yet', 'yet', 'style', 'atmospheric', 'presence', 'attained', 'cult', 'following', 'dedication', 'crime', 'drama', 'diverting', 'lately', 'last', 'two', 'films', 'formulated', 'niche', 'many', 'find', 'alluring', 'commanding', 'really', 'liked', 'Own', 'Night', 'Two', 'Lovers', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Yards', 'yet', 'was', 'bewildered', 'tad', 'fans', 'film', 'struck', 'anything', 'remarkable.', 'Little', 'Odessa', 'different', 'story.This', 'debut', 'film', 'Gray', 'bleak', 'grungy', 'picture', 'crime', 'underbelly', 'ways', 'particular', 'family', 'apart', 'Joshua', 'black', 'sheep', 'family', 'disappeared', 'time', 'working', 'Russian', 'mob', 'Called', 'back', 'hometown', 'job', 'younger', 'brother', 'Reuben', 'odds', 'domineering', 'disapproving', 'father', 'mother', 'deathbed', 'presence', 'causing', 'stir', 'local', 'thugs', 'Joshua', 'bond', 'brother', 'say', 'goodbyes', 'mother', 'while', 'keeping', 'low', 'profile', 'cleaning', 'up', 'messy', 'job.It', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'established', 'such', 'tone', 'film', 'creating', 'lingering', 'tension', 'scene', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'nailing', 'not', 'only', 'accent', 'also', 'stern', 'accountability', 'cold', 'swagger', 'character', 'exude', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'physicality', 'role', 'Maximilian', 'Schell', 'who', 'was', 'brightest', 'surprise', 'here', 'way', 'depiction', 'father', 'Arkady', 'was', 'flawless', 'Such', 'pent', 'frustration', 'anger', 'such', 'calloused', 'pain', 'internal', 'suffering', 'balanced', 'out', 'aspect', 'character', 'development', 'sharp', 'understanding', 'control.So', 'year', 'produced', 'very', 'little', 'get', 'overly', 'excited', 'Little', 'Odessa', 'proved', 'be', 'staggering', 'surprise', 'true', 'gem', 'film']",Little Odessa VHS

The only well-known cast members that I knew of were Maximillian Schell and Vanessa Redgrave, and I never recognized them until I saw their names in the credits. They have aged, as have we all.  That is more a reflection on me than on the cast, no doubt, because I don't keep up with Hollywood's latest talent, and the ones I do recognize have changed.  But, they can still act! The cast is relatively scanty; the movie, however, is of high quality. No need for more cast members.The color is muted, and it suits the film.  It is set in New York City, in Brooklyn. The film evokes emotion, but the acting, though skillful, is also muted.  Nothing is overstated. It is very well directed, obviously.This is the story of a Russian Jewish hit-man, Joshua Shapira (Tim Roth) who is reluctantly returned to his home territory (Brooklyn), where he is a wanted man, for a contract killing.Joshua finds that his mother, Irina (Vanessa Redgrave), is dying of a brain tumor, and his younger brother, Reuben (Edward Furlong) is cutting school, smoking dope, drinking, and generally headed for trouble. His father, Arkady (Maximillian Schell) is aware that he has failed in bringing up his oldest son.  He has a mistress. although he loves his wife.  Arkady rejects Joshua as a &quot;street rat,&quot; who is loved by Reuben and his mother, Irina. The whole story is fraught with pent-up emotion.  Execution scenes, although shown, are not overly graphic, although the film is rated &quot;R&quot; (probably for language).It is made for mature audiences, but is of good quality throughout.

379996,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6303566685,Linda Linguvic,"[18, 18]","This 1994 film is set in Brighton Beach, the area of Brooklyn where Russians have settled.  It's a rough and gritty neighborhood and we meet a family with multiple problems.  The oldest son, Tim Roth, is a hit man for the mob who's been out of touch with his family for several years but has to come back to the neighborhood to carry out a murder.  His teenage brother adores him and follows him to all the wrong places.  The mother, played by Vanessa Redgrave, is dying of a brain tumor.  The father, played by Maximillian Schell, works hard all day at a newspaper stand, cheats on his wife and is brutal to his sons.  There is violence and murder throughout and the audience knows it will just get worse.Usually, I complain because films like this are not realistic.  However, I felt just the opposite about this film.  It is almost too realistic, cruel and depressing.  And there is no bit of lightness to offset the somber mood.  I also felt some real emotion.  To me this was serious stuff.Performances were uniformly excellent, especially that of Maximillian Schell.  He came across a real person with upsets and conflicts and bad choices.  Tim Roth, who is actually a British actor, managed to get the New York street accent just right.  The rest of the cast seemed completely authentic.  I especially liked the family's large run-down apartment and the scenes shot near the beach during the winter.  And the murders made me shudder because they were so very real.The drama held my attention and let me feel the dilemma of this troubled family.  It ends sadly, as I expected it would.

380001,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,6303566685,Stephanie De Pue,"[4, 4]","""Little Odessa,"" (1994), written and directed by James Gray, is a remarkably powerful and effective, award-winning crime drama set among the Russian community in present-day Brooklyn, New York.  At its heart, it's a tale of a dysfunctional family that has lost its way in its new American life.  And it's been given a top-drawer cast, all of whom fully inhabit their roles.  Arkady Shapira, played by Maximilian Schell, is the unhappy father of this brood: in Russia, he was a respected man; in Brooklyn he runs a newsstand.  Irina, his wife, played by the superb Vanessa Redgrave, is suffering from a brain tumor.  Tim Roth, in one of his best performances, is their disaffected son Joshua; he's become a professional hit man, and long exiled himself from family and neighborhood.  Edward Furlong plays his confused younger brother Reuben.  Moira Kelly turns in a fine performance as Alla Shustervich, former girlfriend of Roth's character.Life and death business brings Roth's character back to Brooklyn's Brighton Beach neighborhood;it resembles the Russian Odessa, as both lie on the sea.  It's bleak in winter, and he knows he should not return.  But return he does, yearning to restore relations with his family, over his father's objections.  It soon proves to have not been a good idea.Those of us who lived in Brooklyn as the Russians came crowding in in the hundreds of thousands never quite knew what to make of them, nor, I suppose, do we yet.  But this is surely the Brooklyn we know, with its massive, solid, prewar buildings -- huge boilers in the basements -- in which entire families have been born, lived, and died.  And Gray's intense script has given his characters here dialog and usage that any Brooklynite would recognize, and these actors, most especially including the English Roth, have sure got the local accent.The movie is as bleak in outlook and outcome as its wintry,dirty-snowy setting, and, in its specificity and verisimilitude, it earns its status as a solid gangster picture.",4,"A Specific, Solid Gangster Picture",1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2008,2011,"['Little', 'Odessa', '1994', 'written', 'directed', 'James', 'Gray', 'remarkably', 'powerful', 'effective', 'award-winning', 'crime', 'drama', 'set', 'Russian', 'community', 'present-day', 'Brooklyn', 'New', 'York', 'heart', 'tale', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'lost', 'way', 'new', 'American', 'life', 'been', 'given', 'top-drawer', 'cast', 'whom', 'fully', 'inhabit', 'roles', 'Arkady', 'Shapira', 'played', 'Maximilian', 'Schell', 'unhappy', 'father', 'brood', 'Russia', 'was', 'respected', 'man', 'Brooklyn', 'newsstand', 'Irina', 'wife', 'played', 'superb', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'suffering', 'brain', 'tumor', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'disaffected', 'son', 'Joshua', 'become', 'professional', 'hit', 'man', 'long', 'exiled', 'family', 'neighborhood', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'confused', 'younger', 'brother', 'Reuben', 'Moira', 'Kelly', 'fine', 'performance', 'Alla', 'Shustervich', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'Roth', 'character.Life', 'death', 'business', 'Roth', 'character', 'back', 'Brooklyn', 'Brighton', 'Beach', 'neighborhood', 'Russian', 'Odessa', 'lie', 'sea', 'bleak', 'winter', 'should', 'not', 'return', 'return', 'yearning', 'restore', 'relations', 'family', 'father', 'objections', 'soon', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'good', 'idea.Those', 'who', 'lived', 'Brooklyn', 'Russians', 'came', 'crowding', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'never', 'quite', 'knew', 'what', 'make', 'suppose', 'do', 'yet', 'surely', 'Brooklyn', 'know', 'massive', 'solid', 'prewar', 'buildings', 'huge', 'boilers', 'basements', 'entire', 'families', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'lived', 'died', 'Gray', 'intense', 'script', 'given', 'characters', 'here', 'dialog', 'usage', 'Brooklynite', 'would', 'recognize', 'actors', 'most', 'especially', 'including', 'English', 'Roth', 'have', 'sure', 'got', 'local', 'accent.The', 'movie', 'bleak', 'outlook', 'outcome', 'wintry', 'dirty-snowy', 'setting', 'specificity', 'verisimilitude', 'status', 'solid', 'gangster', 'picture']",Little Odessa VHS
380002,ABLBRUT8DALNN,6303566685,Todd Smith,"[0, 2]","Billed as another Goodfellas, Little Odessa is the story of a mafia hitman returning home to do a job, as well as seeing the poor immigrant family he left behind. The story is great, the movie is not. Tim Roth is fantastic as the disowned, disgraced, murderous son. Roth always gives a very strong performance and does so again here. Edward Furlong, one of my favorites, unfortunately does not do as well. I've seen him in enough things to know, it's not his fault, it's the writing. This film is so dark and painfully slow that I barely made it through. Very little is explained and the dialogue is laughable, even at times non-existent. There are huge plot holes to go along with an ending that makes little sense. The writer was trying to tell his story more through imagery and symbolism in a genre that is based on action. You can't pull off something like this without explaining more of the story and using it to move things along.
