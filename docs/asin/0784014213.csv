I don't recommend this movie AT ALL to anyone who hates suspense, things left unexplained and an astounding amount of symbolism.Because that's what this movie is, hints, lies, betrayal, intriguing, 'controversial', yet strangely beautiful at the same time.The trailer to this movie is annoyingly misleading, but this movie is hard to explain well without giving too much.Remember -everything- means something. (Put the audio commentary on, you might even have to, to understand some parts.) Right down to the colors of the clothing, placement of objects and the tiniest of movements. There's less than six speaking roles and besides the three main characters they're meaningless.David (Alan Rickman), Alexis (Polly Walker) are a not yet middle aged married couple, yet are so obviously tired and annoyed with each other it nearly makes the viewer wish they would just admit it. But that's part of the beauty, the dialogue is near perfect to express this.They vacation to their (Rather, Alexis' dead grandfathers home on a private island.) to rekindle dead flames in a sense. (Even -that- is symbolized, find it. ;)) On the way to catch the ferry, they find a Young Man (Norman Reedus) and by a series of small 'coincidental' events, ends up at their home. And while being a wedge between them, no one seems to want him to leave. Utterly everything falls apart and it makes the viewer wonder who is control of what--the feeling of control and who is betraying/hurting/lying to/being shady to whom and why.There's questions that will make you look back on and rethink and very wrong assumptions. 'Hey...why did he beep the horn?', 'Why is she wearing that?', 'Did he do that on purpose?', 'She's just as bad! But...', 'Oh...I understand now.', 'That's kind of...beautiful...well, no..'. And so on and so on.Mixed sexual feelings and attraction, the desire of the couple to -feel- again, a twisted admission of love, cruel words and very educated yet dark minds using knowledge to everyone's own advantage.The scenery was lovely and it did distract you at some points and very solidly put together acting. The three characters had to carry the movie and did so well.So keep your minds way, way open, along with your eyes, shut up, sit back and watch. If it doesn't leave you going ""Huh...what? Wait, did he..? Why did she? They what, why? Wait; hold on there..."" Then you're not watching it right.

77779,A29T1N4046PGWN,0784014213,Cubbie,"[0, 1]","I would like to see how this movie compares with the book which I have not yet read (it's on my ""to read"" list).  It's not a horrible movie despite some slow scenes,  but the ending (final scene) seemed to come out of nowhere. Usually with a surprise ending such as this I like to go back and watch for clues that I missed that would have alerted me to a twist.  I'm able to see the clues in terms of the wife but after watching it several times now I'm just not picking up any hints that would explain the final scene.  Hence, the surprise ending seems almost out of place, as though the writer decided last minute to throw a twist in to make it more exciting, and it did need some excitement.  Again, I've made it a point to read the book to see if it's any better.  Regardless, if you're going to make a movie based on a book the movie should be able to stand alone and I don't think this one does.  A little disappointing.Redeeming qualities lie strictly in the acting.  Norman Reedus does a great job playing a believable and somewhat creepy drifter and Alan Rickman easily portrays the rather mundane and grumpy husband with a touch of nastiness that, unfortunately, seems stereotypical of this actor (honestly, I wish he were more particular about the scripts he chooses!).  Polly Walker gives an adequate performance...nothing that would make me stand up and applaud.A little disappointing but may feel differently if you've read the book.",3,Hmmm...,1194912000,"11 13, 2007",2007,1447,"['would', 'like', 'see', 'how', 'movie', 'book', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'read', 'read', 'list', 'not', 'horrible', 'movie', 'slow', 'scenes', 'ending', 'final', 'scene', 'seemed', 'come', 'nowhere', 'Usually', 'surprise', 'ending', 'such', 'like', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'clues', 'missed', 'would', 'have', 'alerted', 'twist', ""'m"", 'able', 'see', 'clues', 'terms', 'wife', 'watching', 'several', 'times', 'now', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'picking', 'up', 'hints', 'would', 'explain', 'final', 'scene', 'Hence', 'surprise', 'ending', 'almost', 'place', 'writer', 'decided', 'last', 'minute', 'throw', 'twist', 'make', 'more', 'exciting', 'did', 'need', 'excitement', 'Again', ""'ve"", 'made', 'point', 'read', 'book', 'see', 'better', 'Regardless', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'stand', 'alone', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'little', 'disappointing.Redeeming', 'qualities', 'lie', 'strictly', 'acting', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'believable', 'somewhat', 'creepy', 'drifter', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'easily', 'rather', 'mundane', 'grumpy', 'husband', 'touch', 'nastiness', 'unfortunately', 'stereotypical', 'actor', 'honestly', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'particular', 'scripts', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'adequate', 'performance', 'nothing', 'would', 'make', 'stand', 'up', 'applaud.A', 'little', 'disappointing', 'may', 'feel', 'differently', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book']",N/A

I then watched the third time and found that I enjoyed the film. I feel that all the actors did a great job with these roles.Speaking as a Rickman fan, I was totally shocked at the ending and during the second and third viewing I had to close my eyes after he goes up the hill from skinny dipping.

Holmes,"[5, 5]","Like many, probably most, people checking out this DVD, I got it because Alan Rickman is in it and I often (though not always) enjoy watching his performances.  From the perspective of watching Rickman practicing the craft of acting (I know that sound god-awful pretentious), I was not disappointed.  This movie is almost like a play with 3 performers.  The performances are almost entirely what carries the film -- settings, props,  cinematography, are secondary compared to most films.  The script calls for the performances to be ambiguous -- appearances are always deceiving, and it was interesting to see how the actors achieved this.The DVD includes a commentary by the director.  Basically, you can watch the movie with a voice-over by the director about how scenes were done, what the performers had difficulty with, why a scene was set up the way it was, etc.  This is great!  Make sure to re-watch with the commentary if you're at all interested in how movies are made.  I wish all DVDs would come with this.As for the film's entertainment value, well, this is not a DVD that I would rent to watch with friends on a Saturday night.  This was more like a ""Wednesday night watch by myself with the remote so I can ponder scenes multiple times"" kind of DVD.  As for buying versus renting, well, if you're an obsessive Rickman fan for whom the thought of photographic proof that he is a man (as if there were any doubt) gives you heart palpations, then by all means buy it.  Everyone else should probably rent first and then decide.Note (for those wanting to savor 'the Voice'): Rickman affects an American accent -- that drifts around regionally, a few words come out with a distinctly southern lilt even.

Marin ""voracious reader""","[1, 1]","It becomes clear fairly early on that one of the main themes of ""Dark Harbor"" is poison - that which has seeped into the Weinbergs' marriage as well as that which lurks within the mushrooms that Polly Walker's character identifies in the woods. Writer/director Adam Coleman Howard wove that idea into an unconventional drama/thriller carried almost entirely by four characters: an heiress, her older husband, a young drifter, and the haunting Maine landscape.I must say that this film disappointed me. It held my attention, but in general felt acted, like a scripted play rather than a glimpse into the actual lives of real people. And while normally I adore Alan Rickman's rich, mellifluous voice, his delivery here was often stilted and mechanical, perhaps because he was concentrating so hard on trying to maintain his dreadful American accent with its grating overemphasized r's.The ending was not the surprise to me that other reviewers described, although no doubt partly because I knew there was a twist and so watched the whole thing with an eye towards alternative interpretations of what was shown.

Dark Harbor is a claustrophobic film about a stifling marriage and what happens when a drifter gets drawn into the story. Alan Rickman is multi-layered and superb, as usual, in the role of the frustrated husband. Polly Walker brings a nice mix of edginess and innocence to the young wife. But Norman Reedus does not do a thing for me as the drifter; he's a skanky cypher, and I can't imagine anyone risking it all to connect with this character.That said, the film does an effective build of tension among the threesome, with some ambiguous scenes and dialogue. A highlight of the movie is the little speech about love that Rickman's character delivers near the end of the story. Another highlight, also near the end, is when Rickman's character strips naked and goes skinny dipping in the harbor.

Rather than rehashing the plot this review offers simple and hopefully clarifying suggestions.If you are an Alan Rickman film, do not hesitate; BUY this DVD!  Forget about worrying about his accent, savor looking forward to his nude scenes, but do NOT skip to the end of the movie to view them.  You gamble on missing too much of Rickman's spellbinding performance if you skip even one minute of this small, but very effective film.Previous viewers who saw the movie on VHS will be enlightened by watching it again on DVD.  I have been a movie fan for more years than I want to say, but have now discovered that the nuances of many films have sometimes escaped me totally over those decades.  If ever there was something to be learned from a commentary this is the film to prove it (along with 'South of Heaven, West of Hell').  Not that the film itself needs to be explained, but the element of how a director presents of a film; the mood attained by the camera angles, the symbols included in every scene, the intricate details of the shooting of the movie, the input of the actors (particularly one as great as Alan Rickman) into their roles, the subtle nuances of looks, glances, and plot building all lend a deeper understanding and enjoyment of 'Dark Harbor'.  The wealth of this information provided by director Adam Coleman Howard makes viewing this film only on VHS almost like not watching the same film.  On no other commentary I have seen has the director stuck so directly to the point; which is to give his very detailed insights, his specific direction reasoning, the information upon which he draw, the always educational tutorage on the problems of film-making such as the weather, the seasons, the locale, etc., and the final solutions, and basic reasoning used to determine just what we see woven into the finished film.For fans of films seeking entertainment, the information on this commentary add layers of pleasure.  For students seeking knowledge concerning construction of a film, the director's comments are to the point, succinct, and very detailed.  This DVD would vastly add to your education.There is a problem with renting versus owning the DVD.  You will want to watch the film at least three times for true understanding; first for the initial unveiling of the plot, then the film with the commentary, and the third time with the more heightened awareness you will garner from the director's inside information.  Then, for lovers of Alan Rickman, you will want to watch the work of this brilliant actor again and again well past the three-time mark because he offers to his craft a level of skill that leaves one in awe.If you were introduced to Alan through 'Sense and Sensibility' (while 'Dark Harbor' certainly does not fall into the same category by the stretch of anyone's imagination) and wanted to see more of the actor and his fine work, you owe it to yourself to take the dive, enter the fog, and buy this DVD.  Rickman reveals facets of his skill that are only glimpsed in 'Sense and Sensibility'.  This is a two-way street, if you saw 'Dark Harbor' and were impressed with Rickman's talent, to see his performance in 'S&S;' will add greatly to your admiration.If you are interested enough to read reviews of this film, but are on the fence about 'should I purchase this DVD' or 'can I pass on this one' maybe one of these suggestions will help you make the decision.  More to the point, hopefully you will make the right decision and decide to 'purchase' this intriguing, rich film and enjoy all it has to offer, which is considerable.",4,Some  helpful suggestions about 'Dark Harbor',1054080000,"05 28, 2003",2003,4007,"['dark', 'psychologically-driven', 'film', 'keeps', 'thinking', 'delicious', 'twists', 'subtle', 'hints', 'surprising', 'secrets', 'never', 'what', 'not', 'even', 'when', 'think', 'know', 'know.The', 'plot', 'been', 'well', 'outlined', 'most', 'reviews', 'sometimes', 'perfectly', 'sometimes', 'too', 'much', 'information', 'few', 'times', 'reviewers', 'who', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'watch', 'complete', 'film', 'Rather', 'rehashing', 'plot', 'review', 'simple', 'hopefully', 'clarifying', 'suggestions.If', 'are', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'hesitate', 'BUY', 'DVD', 'Forget', 'worrying', 'accent', 'savor', 'looking', 'forward', 'nude', 'scenes', 'do', 'NOT', 'skip', 'end', 'movie', 'view', 'gamble', 'missing', 'too', 'much', 'Rickman', 'spellbinding', 'performance', 'skip', 'even', 'one', 'minute', 'small', 'very', 'effective', 'film.Previous', 'viewers', 'who', 'saw', 'movie', 'VHS', 'will', 'be', 'enlightened', 'watching', 'again', 'DVD', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'fan', 'more', 'years', 'want', 'say', 'have', 'now', 'discovered', 'nuances', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'sometimes', 'escaped', 'totally', 'decades', 'ever', 'was', 'something', 'be', 'learned', 'commentary', 'film', 'prove', ""'South"", 'Heaven', 'West', 'Hell', 'Not', 'film', 'be', 'explained', 'element', 'how', 'director', 'presents', 'film', 'mood', 'attained', 'camera', 'symbols', 'included', 'scene', 'intricate', 'details', 'shooting', 'movie', 'input', 'actors', 'particularly', 'one', 'as', 'great', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'roles', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'looks', 'glances', 'plot', 'building', 'lend', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'enjoyment', ""'Dark"", 'Harbor', 'wealth', 'information', 'provided', 'director', 'Adam', 'Coleman', 'Howard', 'viewing', 'film', 'only', 'VHS', 'almost', 'not', 'watching', 'same', 'film', 'other', 'commentary', 'have', 'seen', 'director', 'stuck', 'so', 'directly', 'point', 'give', 'very', 'detailed', 'insights', 'specific', 'direction', 'reasoning', 'information', 'always', 'educational', 'tutorage', 'problems', 'film-making', 'such', 'weather', 'seasons', 'locale', 'etc.', 'final', 'solutions', 'basic', 'reasoning', 'used', 'determine', 'just', 'what', 'see', 'woven', 'finished', 'film.For', 'fans', 'films', 'seeking', 'entertainment', 'information', 'commentary', 'add', 'layers', 'pleasure', 'students', 'seeking', 'knowledge', 'concerning', 'construction', 'film', 'director', 'comments', 'are', 'point', 'succinct', 'very', 'detailed', 'DVD', 'would', 'vastly', 'add', 'education.There', 'problem', 'renting', 'versus', 'owning', 'DVD', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'film', 'least', 'three', 'times', 'true', 'understanding', 'first', 'initial', 'unveiling', 'plot', 'then', 'film', 'commentary', 'third', 'time', 'more', 'heightened', 'awareness', 'will', 'garner', 'director', 'inside', 'information', 'Then', 'lovers', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'work', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'again', 'again', 'well', 'three-time', 'mark', 'craft', 'level', 'skill', 'one', 'awe.If', 'were', 'introduced', 'Alan', ""'Sense"", 'Sensibility', 'Harbor', 'certainly', 'not', 'fall', 'same', 'category', 'stretch', 'anyone', 'imagination', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'actor', 'fine', 'work', 'owe', 'yourself', 'take', 'dive', 'enter', 'fog', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Rickman', 'facets', 'skill', 'are', 'only', 'glimpsed', ""'Sense"", 'Sensibility', 'two-way', 'street', 'saw', 'Harbor', 'were', 'impressed', 'Rickman', 'talent', 'see', 'performance', ""'S"", 'S', 'will', 'add', 'greatly', 'admiration.If', 'are', 'interested', 'enough', 'read', 'reviews', 'film', 'are', 'fence', ""'should"", 'purchase', 'DVD', ""'can"", 'pass', 'one', 'maybe', 'one', 'suggestions', 'will', 'help', 'make', 'decision', 'More', 'point', 'hopefully', 'will', 'make', 'right', 'decision', 'decide', ""'purchase"", 'intriguing', 'rich', 'film', 'enjoy', 'offer', 'considerable']",N/A

Her reactions to some of the situations weren't as strong as I thought they could be, but overall she did okay.Norman Reedus (sp?) did a very good job as playing a very mysterious man who David (Rickman) and Alexis (Walker) pick up on the side of the road.
