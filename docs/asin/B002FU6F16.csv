1266829,A1IQVBGOYVEFBI,B002FU6F16,Allan Brain,"[9, 11]","As someone with quite a lot of experience with bipolar disorder, mental illness generally, and suicide in particular, I of course had to see this movie.  It's about a really important subject, teenage suicide, and also about a mental disorder that is underdiagnosed--friends tease me that I claim that everyone is bi-polar.Formerly known as ""manic depressives"", sufferers of bipolar disorder have ""highs"" and ""lows"". Way before this film identifies poor ""Evan"" as suffering from this disorder, it was obvious to me that's what he had.  As a young child, he was highly creative, artistic, intensely loving and charming, yet sometimes just the opposite, with a blank affect and inappropriate and destructive thoughts and actions.  Classic for a bipolar child.  But the really alarming thing is that this kid expressed what the professionals call ""suicidal ideation""--that is, he talked about killing himself and even how he would do it, and what is more, there were even attempts or ""mock attempts"" at suicide early in childhood.  This is very unusual and it points up one of two or three serious flaws that I find in the film.  I saw the film on HBO.  If the DVD addresses these points in extra material, which it should, then you have to buy the DVD to get what should be in an appendix to the film.If the DVD does not contain explanations of these or perhaps other points, then please see my comments below and consider them carefully. They have to do with detection, therapy, and prevention of suicide in bipolar patients. (No, I am not a psychiatrist, but I have family members and friends with bipolar disorder and I have experience with suicides of friends and clients where I have researched the issues, and as a lawyer I have represented families of suicide victims.)I certainly do not want to be critical of the family here, only of the film-maker.  There is no doubt that Evan was a wonderful child.  You see it throughout this film.  And he may not have had some of the ""issues"" that many bipolar kids have.  It's clear from the remarks of his older half-brother that Evan's concerns, as expressed in a coldly analytical suicide note, were very mainstream. He worried that he was going to be a failure, that criticisms of him were true, that his friends were not really friends, and that kind of thing.  As Nick says, every fifteen year old thinks about these things, just maybe not as intensely as Evan did, again leading to one of my points of criticism below.1.  To its credit, the film has extensive information, including interviews with the boy's psychiatrist after the suicide, where the doctor rightly observes that kids who are medicated for bipolar disorder may have their conditions change, and may or may not go off their medicine regimen, and the results are unpredictable and tricky. Looking back, these parents more or less acknowledge that Evan needed to go back on Lithium (probably the most effective drug and one that several friends and family members I know have done well  with for years).  But the film does not follow up with some succinct and non-controversial practical advice about detecting bipolar disorder. That would include, for example, intense emotional responses to ordinary stimuli, impulsive destructive behavior, obsessive sexual behavior, and most importantly, substance abuse.  It's unclear whether Evan had substance abuse problems or any kind of sexual anxiety, but that doesn't matter.  Part of the purpose of this film, such as it is, should be more than a celebration of Evan's life.  It should try to help out.  So I would have liked to have seen discussion of these important points about detecting bipolar disorder in kids.2.  Again, to its credit, the film suggests, though not strongly enough, that any child who expresses suicidal thoughts needs to be taken seriously.  Yet the ""therapy"" that is more or less endorsed by this film is pretty much a substitute family therapy, where Evan was sent to a place where he learned self-reliance and responsibility, if you make a mess you need to clean it up and that kind of thing.  How do we know that this is what helped him turn around?  I missed a discussion of ""family therapy"", that is, direct discussion in the family, assisted by trained counselors, which I have found from experience to be very effective.  And when you see the circumstances of Evan's suicide, it seems to me that this kind of therapy may have been needed.  I was wondering if it was ever tried. (Note: most insurance companies will not pay for any kind of ""talk therapy"".)3.  ""Spirit of the moment"".  Here again, I am not critical of Evan's family, though I have to say that in my experience handling legal cases involving suicides, this always comes up and I think the film-maker should have addressed it because it is obvious.  Late in the film, in some of the most poignant moments, one of Evan's young friends remarks that he thinks that the suicide was just done ""in the spirit of the moment"", i.e. impulsively, despite the note where Evan outlined his thinking.  This is a kid who has expressed suicidal ideation from early childhood and particularly in connection with a particular method of accomplishing suicide.Suicides are often impulsive just as bipolar patients are.  People who are suicidal should not have loaded guns around.  See the film and you will know what I am talking about.Again, my heart goes out to this family and I am very sorry for their loss, but I would have liked to see more about how to prevent other tragedies like this.",4,"Important, moving, timely, but something is missing",1249862400,"08 10, 2009",2009,5535,"['someone', 'lot', 'experience', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'mental', 'illness',

1266831,A3MNJL4ROH6LRW,B002FU6F16,Don R. Holloway,"[2, 3]","I just finished watching the documentary ""Boy Interrupted"" on DVD. I thought this was a very moving film, but also painful at the same time. It is the story about Evan Scott Perry who took his own life at the age of 15 because he could no longer live with the mental and emotional suffering caused by bipolar disorder. The film chronicles - in a very open and honest way - the life of this beautiful child Evan. Even for those who have had friends or family members with bipolar disorder, this disease can still seem mysterious. We feel at a loss as to what we should do. I know that in cases of suicide some people will feel the need to ask you why you didn't see a sign or why you didn't interpret a certain action as a cry for help. It's easy to say those things after the fact. But the truth is, children are very complex beings. And every child is different, with different personalities and different behavior patterns. Yet this is normal. In the documentary, Evan's parents and teachers did a good job at recognizing when Evan's behavior was inappropriate. But knowing how to deal with that and what to do requires a much higher level of skill than the average person possesses. The thing which could have contributed to Evan's suicide - and this is only speculation made after the fact - was reducing his level of lithium. Nobody could have known at the time what the results of this action would be. And indeed, even if the dosage level hadn't been reduced, who's to say the result would have been different. These are all just thoughts that might go through the mind of someone viewing this film. It would be impossible to capture the complexity of this subject in its totality in this brief review. But this documentary does the job in a very admirable, loving and respectful way. The parents of Evan should be commended for giving us this beautiful piece of work. It is the ultimate tribute to Evan, who was - and is - the real beauty behind this story.",5,A Painfully Open and Honest Film,1298851200,"02 28, 2011",2011,1965,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'documentary', 'Boy', 'Interrupted', 'DVD', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'moving', 'film', 'also', 'painful', 'same', 'time', 'story', 'Evan', 'Scott', 'Perry', 'who', 'took', 'own', 'life', 'age', '15', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'live', 'mental', 'emotional', 'suffering', 'caused', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'film', 'very', 'open', 'honest', 'way', 'life', 'beautiful', 'child', 'Evan', 'Even', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'friends', 'family', 'members', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'disease', 'can', 'still', 'seem', 'mysterious', 'feel', 'loss', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'know', 'cases', 'suicide', 'people', 'will', 'feel', 'need', 'ask', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'sign', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'interpret', 'certain', 'action', 'cry', 'help', 'easy', 'say', 'things', 'fact', 'truth', 'children', 'are', 'very', 'complex', 'beings', 'child', 'different', 'different', 'personalities', 'different', 'behavior', 'patterns', 'normal', 'documentary', 'Evan', 'parents', 'teachers', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'recognizing', 'when', 'Evan', 'behavior', 'was', 'inappropriate', 'knowing', 'how', 'deal', 'what', 'do', 'much', 'higher', 'level', 'skill', 'average', 'person', 'possesses', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'contributed', 'Evan', 'suicide', 'only', 'speculation', 'made', 'fact', 'was', 'reducing', 'level', 'lithium', 'Nobody', 'could', 'have', 'known', 'time', 'what', 'results', 'action', 'would', 'be', 'indeed', 'even', 'dosage', 'level', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'reduced', 'who', 'say', 'result', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'are', 'just', 'thoughts', 'might', 'go', 'mind', 'someone', 'viewing', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'capture', 'complexity', 'subject', 'totality', 'brief', 'review', 'documentary', 'job', 'very', 'admirable', 'loving', 'respectful', 'way', 'parents', 'Evan', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'giving', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'work', 'ultimate', 'tribute', 'Evan', 'who', 'was', 'real', 'beauty', 'story']",N/A

""evan's sick, there's something wrong with evan,"" from KINDERGARTEN  on this is repeated over and over...how messed up could this kid have been in KINDERGARTEN? no wonder he hated himself. anytime someone lables a five or six-year-old child ""bipolar,"" perhaps you should look more at the ACCUSER than the accused. you'd probably hate yourself too if everyone was always telling you there was something wrong with you! boo. hiss. suicidal impulses are not simply the result of misfiring  neurons. they arise from desires to ""get back"" at those who've ignored or hurt you,  a desperate need to free yourself from the burdens and responsibilities of living, a desire to dodge the expectations of achievement; an inner yearning to end overwhelming fear, intense pain, or intolerable stress;  or sometimes simply... a wish to escape  the banal tedium of existence.this movie is scary because it marginalizes the feelings of the suicide victim  and attempts to canonize his family members as martyrs and saints. it paints them as prisoners of his selfish and tiresome pathology.  it's a close minded, cave man mentality. they NEVER try to understand this boy, they just decide from the get-go: ""evan is bad, evan is broken. our family is good, our family will fix him.""well, what a nice, superior position to be in. how lovely to spend one's days passing judgment on the sick and insane, and creating films lauding  your long-suffering tolerance and piety.i'm sorry but i'm not buying it. the very fact that this film was even MADE, what with it's cheesy hollywood blockbuster/oscar-bait  rip-off title, is extremely suspicious.there is no exploration of circumstances in evan's life or factors in evan's environment  OUTSIDE of his ""disorder"" that may have contributed to this tragic event. NONE WHATSOEVER. these people are trying to absolve themselves of the guilt they feel for having inappropriately  handled their child. obviously, the intense psychiatry, forced medication FROM THE AGE OF FIVE ON, AND LITTLE TRIPS OFF TO THE LOONY BIN STARTING IN THE PRE-TEENAGE YEARS DIDN'T HELP MUCH, DID THEY MOM AND DAD? but you certainly wouldn't want a child like THAT around at home, right? i mean, you had your important film careers to focus on, you couldn't keep a loser like that about the house, could ya? he really just got in the WAY. yeah... i'm sure this didn't make evan feel bad AT ALL.maybe if they would have put their damn cameras down for a half a second and oh, i don't know, actually spent a little uninterrupted, focused time with this kid, they would have found themselves with a  much better adjusted boy. one who wasn't destined to become (ahem)  ""interrupted.""this is a VERY biased film.there is nothing that can take away this family's pain, and my heart does go out

mental state. right? kinda hard to ask him now. really look at this film. examine the mother, father, and the brother and see what you THINK and how you FEEL.  i think you may find your sympathies
