581324,A17TDSX354MP7Y,B00005BIG6,CPTScott,"[18, 18]","I've been doing Yoga for the past 9 years every day and in the last few months have been adding Pilates in daily before my Yoga practice. Since getting into Pilates I've collected a good number of DVD's and VHS's as well as the Alycea Ungaro book ""Pilates, Body in Motion"".I was actually given this DVD by Jennifer Kries as a gift from my wife. I only work with the ""Precision Toning"" part of the program  (not the ""Sculpting"" section) because I get all the strength work I need from Power Vinyasa Yoga, but that section alone is enough to make this a praiseworthy addition to my library.I find Ms. Kries to be an excellent instructor who gives precise, easy to understand instruction and does a beautiful job demonstrating the exercises. Though she is very advanced and super flexible she shows how to modify all the exercises to make them safe and doable. I find her to have a friendly and encouraging demeanor which makes it a pleasure to do the practice.A key thing for me with any Pilates or Yoga program is how it is paced. I really love the ""tempo"" of this program, you never feel rushed yet there is a nice momentum throughout the DVD. That can often be a hard line to walk and she does it to perfection.If one is new to Pilates or short on time you can do the essentials practice, but if you are more advanced you can move into the full routine. Basically it's the Pilates Intermediate series but it has an extensive side lying series which really puts me through my paces (actually it has me ""begging for mercy"" :)).If you don't have time to do the full program the DVD has excellent chaptering so you can just do the series that you want to focus on at any given time.I'm very impressed with this program and would highly recommend it!If you've never done any Pilates before you may want to start with Stott Pilates Basics, it's a very thorough program that has detailed instruction which I find to be essentials to learning Pilates as you can strain yourself if you don't approach it properly.",5,Jennifer Kries :Precision Toning and Sculpting,1139875200,"02 14, 2006",2006,2005,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'Yoga', 'past', '9', 'years', 'day', 'last', 'few', 'months', 'have', 'been', 'adding', 'Pilates', 'daily', 'Yoga', 'practice', 'getting', 'Pilates', ""'ve"", 'collected', 'good', 'number', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'as', 'well', 'Alycea', 'Ungaro', 'book', 'Pilates', 'Body', 'Motion', '.I', 'was', 'actually', 'given', 'DVD', 'Jennifer', 'Kries', 'gift', 'wife', 'only', 'work', 'Precision', 'Toning', 'part', 'program', 'not', 'Sculpting', 'section', 'get', 'strength', 'work', 'need', 'Power', 'Vinyasa', 'Yoga', 'section', 'alone', 'enough', 'make', 'praiseworthy', 'addition', 'library.I', 'find', 'Ms.', 'Kries', 'be', 'excellent', 'instructor', 'who', 'precise', 'easy', 'understand', 'instruction', 'beautiful', 'job', 'demonstrating', 'exercises', 'very', 'advanced', 'super', 'flexible', 'how', 'modify', 'exercises', 'make', 'safe', 'doable', 'find', 'have', 'friendly', 'encouraging', 'demeanor', 'pleasure', 'do', 'practice.A', 'key', 'thing', 'Pilates', 'Yoga', 'program', 'how', 'paced', 'really', 'love', 'tempo', 'program', 'never', 'feel', 'rushed', 'yet', 'nice', 'momentum', 'DVD', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'hard', 'line', 'walk', 'perfection.If', 'one', 'new', 'Pilates', 'short', 'time', 'can', 'do', 'essentials', 'practice', 'are', 'more', 'advanced', 'can', 'move', 'full', 'routine', 'Basically', 'Pilates', 'Intermediate', 'series', 'extensive', 'side', 'lying', 'series', 'really', 'paces', 'actually', 'begging', 'mercy', '.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'do', 'full', 'program', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'chaptering', 'can', 'just', 'do', 'series', 'want', 'focus', 'given', 'time.I', ""'m"", 'very', 'impressed', 'program', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', 'Pilates', 'may', 'want', 'start', 'Stott', 'Pilates', 'Basics', 'very', 'thorough', 'program', 'detailed', 'instruction', 'find', 'be', 'essentials', 'learning', 'Pilates', 'can', 'strain', 'do', ""n't"", 'approach', 'properly']",The New Method Pilates: Precision Toning and Sculpting
581325,A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0,B00005BIG6,"Deb Nam-Krane ""dnkboston""","[98, 99]","I am a big Jennifer Kries fan.  I love her newer series (Pilates Method/New Method) and her book, Pilates Plus Method.  I tried in the past to get into some of her older stuff- Precision Toning and Precision Sculpting- and while I thought she gave (as always) great instruction, the workouts were very long and I just couldn't see myself making the commitment on a regular basis.I just recently got this DVD and am now over the moon.  It is very well chaptered.  If your DVD has a programmable play feature, it's easy to split up the workouts so you don't have to do over an hour (Precision Toning) or forty minutes (Precision Sculpting).  Some of my favorite combinations are: the upper body work from PS combined with the side kicks from PT; the matwork/Method Toning (minus the side kicks) from PT; and Toning Essentials from PT and the pelvic lifts/ballet segments from PS.  And while figuring out the specific titles/chapters on some DVDs can be a nightmare, this is pretty straightforward: Title 1 is PT, Title 2 is PS, and the chapters for each segment are numbered on the title menu they provide.Though some may already have other Pilates workouts (even other Jennifer Kries workouts) I still recommend this tape.  The side kicks segment alone is worth the money- I could not believe how much my thighs and buttocks burned the first time I did her sequence, and I'd been a Pilates &quot;veteran&quot; for quite some time.One final comment: when these two workouts were first released, everyone kept going on about how they were &quot;fusion&quot; workouts, combining Pilates, dance and yoga.  Having done them, I can guarantee that they are almost completely straight up Pilates (with a little dance thrown in at the end of Precision Sculpting).  Yes, we do use Child's Pose a few times, but that move has been used in &quot;pure&quot; Pilates practices for years.  Not that this takes anything away from the workouts- I just wouldn't want someone to be disappointed by the lack of yoga on this DVD.",5,"Excellent, well-chaptered DVD",1089244800,"07 8, 2004",2004,2007,"['am', 'big', 'Jennifer', 'Kries', 'fan', 'love', 'newer', 'series', 'Pilates', 'Method/New', 'Method', 'book', 'Pilates', 'Plus', 'Method', 'tried', 'past', 'get', 'older', 'stuff-', 'Precision', 'Toning', 'Precision', 'Sculpting-', 'thought', 'gave', 'always', 'great', 'instruction', 'workouts', 'were', 'very', 'long', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'making', 'commitment', 'regular', 'basis.I', 'just', 'recently', 'got', 'DVD', 'am', 'now', 'moon', 'very', 'well', 'chaptered', 'DVD', 'programmable', 'play', 'feature', 'easy', 'split', 'up', 'workouts', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'over', 'hour', 'Precision', 'Toning', 'forty', 'minutes', 'Precision', 'Sculpting', 'favorite', 'combinations', 'are', 'upper', 'body', 'work', 'PS', 'combined', 'side', 'PT', 'matwork/Method', 'Toning', 'side', 'kicks', 'PT', 'Toning', 'Essentials', 'PT', 'pelvic', 'lifts/ballet', 'segments', 'PS', 'figuring', 'out', 'specific', 'titles/chapters', 'DVDs', 'can', 'be', 'nightmare', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'Title', '1', 'PT', 'Title', '2', 'PS', 'chapters', 'segment', 'are', 'numbered', 'title', 'menu', 'provide.Though', 'may', 'already', 'have', 'other', 'Pilates', 'workouts', 'even', 'other', 'Jennifer', 'Kries', 'still', 'recommend', 'tape', 'side', 'segment', 'alone', 'money-', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'much', 'thighs', 'buttocks', 'burned', 'first', 'time', 'did', 'sequence', ""'d"", 'been', 'Pilates', 'quot', 'veteran', 'quot', 'quite', 'time.One', 'final', 'comment', 'when', 'two', 'workouts', 'were', 'first', 'released', 'everyone', 'kept', 'going', 'how', 'were', 'quot', 'fusion', 'quot', 'workouts', 'combining', 'Pilates', 'dance', 'yoga', 'Having', 'done', 'can', 'guarantee', 'are', 'almost', 'completely', 'straight', 'up', 'Pilates', 'little', 'dance', 'thrown', 'end', 'Precision', 'Sculpting', 'Yes', 'do', 'use', 'Child', 'Pose', 'few', 'times', 'move', 'been', 'used', 'quot', 'pure', 'quot', 'Pilates', 'practices', 'years', 'Not', 'anything', 'away', 'workouts-', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'someone', 'be', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'yoga', 'DVD']",The New Method Pilates: Precision Toning and Sculpting

581329,A175N19FS2B4J,B00005BIG6,Poppyx,"[6, 6]","I taught Pilates professionally for five years.  One of the things that really frustrated me and my students was the number of videos/workouts that were marketed as being Pilates, but weren't Pilates workouts at all.There are lots of Pilates videos out there:  a lot of them don't teach much Pilates, though.  This is real Pilates Matwork;  more importantly, the exercises are taught in the right order.The order really matters--without the order, your back isn't as safe:  Joseph Pilates made a point of following spinal flexion, meaning you curl forward, with spinal extension, meaning you arch your back.  Following flexion with extension theoretically means that the material in the discs in your spine is pushed out of place and then back again, by moving the spine itself forward and back.Also, much of the rest of the Matwork stretches the muscles you will use in the next exercise, again, so you don't get hurt.  Doing Pilates exercises by themselves in a vacuum is nowhere near as safe as doing them in the order that they were traditionally taught.O.k., off the soapbox:  this is the real thing;  don't waste your money on something else.",5,This is real Pilates.,1222732800,"09 30, 2008",2008,1148,"['taught', 'Pilates', 'professionally', 'five', 'years', 'One', 'things', 'really', 'frustrated', 'students', 'was', 'number', 'videos/workouts', 'were', 'marketed', 'being', 'Pilates', 'were', ""n't"", 'Pilates', 'workouts', 'are', 'lots', 'Pilates', 'videos', 'out', 'there', 'lot', 'do', ""n't"", 'teach', 'much', 'Pilates', 'though', 'real', 'Pilates', 'Matwork', 'more', 'importantly', 'exercises', 'are', 'taught', 'right', 'order.The', 'order', 'really', 'matters', 'order', 'back', ""n't"", 'safe', 'Joseph', 'Pilates', 'made', 'point', 'following', 'spinal', 'flexion', 'meaning', 'curl', 'forward', 'spinal', 'extension', 'meaning', 'arch', 'back', 'Following', 'flexion', 'extension', 'theoretically', 'material', 'discs', 'spine', 'pushed', 'place', 'then', 'back', 'again', 'moving', 'spine', 'forward', 'back.Also', 'much', 'rest', 'Matwork', 'muscles', 'will', 'use', 'next', 'exercise', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hurt', 'Doing', 'Pilates', 'exercises', 'vacuum', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'safe', 'doing', 'order', 'were', 'traditionally', 'taught.O.k.', 'soapbox', 'real', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'something', 'else']",The New Method Pilates: Precision Toning and Sculpting
