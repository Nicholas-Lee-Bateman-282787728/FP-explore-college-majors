187956,A6IKQOVUT6AI4,1572527242,Bonita L. Davis,"[37, 39]","It is 1948. World War II has been over for three years and distinquished  author and poet,Chaim has come to Montreal for a reading. His blissful  sleep is broken by the harsh ring of a phone. On the other end, his one  night stand, requests that he return her necklace. How annoying when you  want to sleep but he acquieces to her request to meet her in the park but  first he must have breakfast.What a beautiful day and such a  bountiful breakfast of eggs, bacon and toast. Just as he begins to dig in  he realizes that it is Rosh Hashana. A man outside of the restaurant stares  at him. Chaim's appetite goes away and before long he reluctantly finds  himself in a minyan. After prayers he escapes to the park where he  encounters him.His enemy, his friend has come to life before him.  The two had thought that the other had perished in the Holocaust as had  their families. They look at each other, keep silence and then a spew of  emotion unleashes as the two clash about the meaning of life and God after  that experience.The Quarrel takes up the age old question of God's  justice or lack there of that plaqued Job and other humans since the dawn  of time. Hersh stands firmly in his fundamentalist faith. Chaim insists on  the goodness of humanity. Both men have become extremists as they attempt  to give some meaning to their lives after being in the Holocaust. Hidden  within their psyches are betrayals, hypocrisy and plain stubbornness that  the two were unable or unwilling to share. This brief moment in the park is  an opportunity for reconciliation, if they choose to do so.A  brilliant film such as this should be shown in every class room and home as  we struggle with the notion of forgiveness, human failure, and religious  faith. All of these questions emerge from the encounter of these two men  who deep inside are filled with loneliness and grief. Rosh Hashana leaves  open for them a new beggining in faith as it will for you.",5,RECONCILIATION,969062400,"09 16, 2000",2000,1953,"['1948', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'been', 'three', 'years', 'distinquished', 'author', 'poet', 'Chaim', 'come', 'Montreal', 'reading', 'blissful', 'sleep', 'broken', 'harsh', 'ring', 'phone', 'other', 'end', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'requests', 'return', 'necklace', 'How', 'annoying', 'when', 'want', 'sleep', 'request', 'meet', 'park', 'first', 'must', 'have', 'breakfast.What', 'beautiful', 'day', 'bountiful', 'breakfast', 'eggs', 'bacon', 'toast', 'Just', 'dig', 'Rosh', 'Hashana', 'A', 'man', 'restaurant', 'stares', 'Chaim', 'appetite', 'away', 'before', 'long', 'reluctantly', 'minyan', 'prayers', 'park', 'where', 'him.His', 'enemy', 'friend', 'come', 'life', 'two', 'had', 'thought', 'other', 'had', 'perished', 'Holocaust', 'had', 'families', 'look', 'other', 'keep', 'silence', 'then', 'spew', 'emotion', 'unleashes', 'two', 'clash', 'meaning', 'life', 'God', 'experience.The', 'Quarrel', 'up', 'age', 'old', 'question', 'God', 'justice', 'lack', 'there', 'plaqued', 'Job', 'other', 'humans', 'dawn', 'time', 'Hersh', 'firmly', 'fundamentalist', 'faith', 'Chaim', 'goodness', 'humanity', 'men', 'have', 'become', 'extremists', 'attempt', 'give', 'meaning', 'lives', 'being', 'Holocaust', 'Hidden', 'psyches', 'are', 'betrayals', 'hypocrisy', 'plain', 'stubbornness', 'two', 'were', 'unable', 'unwilling', 'share', 'brief', 'moment', 'park', 'opportunity', 'reconciliation', 'choose', 'do', 'so.A', 'brilliant', 'film', 'such', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'class', 'room', 'home', 'struggle', 'notion', 'forgiveness', 'human', 'failure', 'religious', 'faith', 'questions', 'emerge', 'encounter', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'deep', 'inside', 'are', 'filled', 'loneliness', 'grief', 'Rosh', 'Hashana', 'open', 'new', 'beggining', 'faith', 'will']",The Quarrel

187959,A1UYL5GIQ8YE77,1572527242,Fred L. Houpt,"[3, 3]","I watched this on VHS a few nights ago for a second time.  On this occassion I seem to have been on the correct frequency because the film jolted me deeply. In fact I would volunteer that the quarrel of these two men is one that I profoundly identify with.  I bring to this review the wonderfully challenging quote from the German philosopher, F. Nietzsche ""Belief means not wanting to know what is true"".  One has to toss that around in the mind for a few minutes until the embers start to glow and we start to feel a rumbling of a predictable emotional reaction.  For those who are the product of a belief system, which in my case was the Judaic, though equally valid for all major religious systems, the notion that belief must be put aside in order to allow the truth to make itself visible....is anametha insofar as the truth was ""believed"" by followers to have been revealed by a higher power, usually through a messenger like a prophet.  So, if that was the case then it was not belief that was an impediment, but a willingness to believe what was revealed.  But, is that the case? Can we be so sure that the ""truth"", whatever this might be, can ONLY be revealed by divine messages?  Or, maybe Nietzsche had it correct, and that we must find the truth on our own, without recourse to falling back on a belief that our ancestors were properly instructed in what truth was?Returning to the film, the premise is that two long seperated Jewish students from a small town in Eastern Europe, who had both thought each other the victims of the holocaust, bump into each other in Montreal long after the war.  The one who had left the Yeshiva to follow Nietzsche's path only had his distaste for faith deepened, the other friend who was devout remained so. Both lost all of their families in the most tragic of ways and both were burnt by the heart break that this forced them to live through.  However, the polarities of their attitudes and choices only made them appear further apart.  But, this is just the premise of the drama and as we listen to them quarrel we see that the fringes of their relationship are filled with many grey areas that they both acknowledge.  They are also incapable and unwilling to allow that mutually shared grey area to muddy their own convictions with any extra ambiguities.  They both argue with equal heartfelt and intelligent passion that their own views are valid and correct.There are some special moments in this drama that bring the two long lost friends to a realization that there will always be places within themselves where their common love and respect for each other, founded in their youth, will always live on.  These areas are highlighted when the men begin to reveal some of their own secrets about what they experienced, choices made that now fill them with regret and pain.  Both men recognize how very much alike they are at simple levels, how their wounds bleed the same color blood, how much they toil to find truth in their own ways.Who then argues for the correct path to enlightenment?  They both do and with equal conviction.  Their argument is everyone's struggle to come to balance the pains of the spirit, the dissapointments and destructions imposed on our hearts and minds.  It is well enough known that many people who began their lives before WW2 and survived concentration camps and ghettos lost all of their faith at wars close.  It is also true that some who lived through the death camps, losing their families, often destroyed before their eyes, also came through with an even deeper belief in their creator and their place in the world.  How do people manage to bring that sort of order to a life that survived such degradation and darkness?  The drama points at that question and the turmoil of the quarrel offers just a few ideas to consider.  Faith, it is said, is a personal matter between a person and their divine figure.  There is probably no more correct approach, one over the other.  If free will is believed to exist, then we can choose our own methods in which we seek our answers, in which we try to find what the truths are.  I would offer that the far greater tragedy is that so few humans stop at some point and ask what the truth is; the greatest mass of humanity accepts what truth is by passive submission to what they have been taught.  How can they examine those truths outside of beliefs grip?The two main actors are Canada's finest and have been in several dramas together.  I strongly recommend this for its provocative and well written dialogues.  Superbly acted; this will linger in the mind for a long time.",5,The trials our faith are put through,1291248000,"12 2, 2010",2010,4606,"['watched', 'VHS', 'few', 'nights', 'ago', 'second', 'time', 'occassion', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'correct', 'frequency', 'film', 'jolted', 'deeply', 'fact', 'would', 'volunteer', 'quarrel', 'two', 'men', 'one', 'profoundly', 'identify', 'bring', 'review', 'wonderfully', 'challenging', 'quote', 'German', 'philosopher', 'F.', 'Nietzsche', 'Belief', 'not', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'true', 'One', 'toss', 'mind', 'few', 'minutes', 'embers', 'start', 'glow', 'start', 'feel', 'rumbling', 'predictable', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'who', 'are', 'product', 'belief', 'system', 'case', 'was', 'Judaic', 'equally', 'valid', 'major', 'religious', 'systems', 'notion', 'belief', 'must', 'be', 'put', 'aside', 'order', 'allow', 'truth', 'make', 'visible', '.is', 'anametha', 'insofar', 'truth', 'was', 'believed', 'followers', 'have', 'been', 'revealed', 'higher', 'power', 'usually', 'messenger', 'prophet', 'So', 'was', 'case', 'then', 'was', 'not', 'belief', 'was', 'impediment', 'willingness', 'believe', 'what', 'was', 'revealed', 'case', 'Can', 'be', 'so', 'sure', 'truth', 'whatever', 'might', 'be', 'can', 'ONLY', 'be', 'revealed', 'divine', 'messages', 'maybe', 'Nietzsche', 'had', 'correct', 'must', 'find', 'truth', 'own', 'recourse', 'falling', 'back', 'belief', 'ancestors', 'were', 'properly', 'instructed', 'what', 'truth', 'was', 'Returning', 'film', 'premise', 'two', 'long', 'seperated', 'Jewish', 'students', 'small', 'town', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'who', 'had', 'thought', 'other', 'victims', 'holocaust', 'bump', 'other', 'Montreal', 'long', 'war', 'one', 'who', 'had', 'left', 'Yeshiva', 'follow', 'Nietzsche', 'path', 'only', 'had', 'distaste', 'faith', 'deepened', 'other', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'devout', 'remained', 'so', 'lost', 'families', 'most', 'tragic', 'ways', 'were', 'burnt', 'heart', 'break', 'forced', 'live', 'However', 'polarities', 'attitudes', 'choices', 'only', 'made', 'appear', 'further', 'apart', 'just', 'premise', 'drama', 'listen', 'quarrel', 'see', 'fringes', 'relationship', 'are', 'filled', 'many', 'grey', 'areas', 'acknowledge', 'are', 'also', 'incapable', 'unwilling', 'allow', 'mutually', 'shared', 'grey', 'area', 'muddy', 'own', 'convictions', 'extra', 'ambiguities', 'argue', 'equal', 'heartfelt', 'intelligent', 'passion', 'own', 'views', 'are', 'valid', 'are', 'special', 'moments', 'drama', 'bring', 'two', 'long', 'lost', 'friends', 'realization', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'places', 'where', 'common', 'love', 'respect', 'other', 'founded', 'youth', 'will', 'always', 'live', 'areas', 'are', 'highlighted', 'when', 'men', 'begin', 'reveal', 'own', 'secrets', 'what', 'experienced', 'choices', 'made', 'now', 'fill', 'regret', 'pain', 'men', 'recognize', 'how', 'very', 'much', 'are', 'simple', 'levels', 'how', 'wounds', 'bleed', 'same', 'color', 'blood', 'how', 'much', 'toil', 'find', 'truth', 'own', 'ways.Who', 'then', 'correct', 'path', 'enlightenment', 'do', 'equal', 'conviction', 'argument', 'everyone', 'struggle', 'come', 'balance', 'pains', 'spirit', 'dissapointments', 'destructions', 'imposed', 'hearts', 'minds', 'well', 'enough', 'known', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'began', 'lives', 'WW2', 'survived', 'concentration', 'camps', 'ghettos', 'lost', 'faith', 'wars', 'close', 'also', 'true', 'who', 'lived', 'death', 'camps', 'losing', 'families', 'often', 'destroyed', 'eyes', 'also', 'came', 'even', 'deeper', 'belief', 'creator', 'place', 'world', 'How', 'do', 'people', 'manage', 'bring', 'sort', 'order', 'life', 'survived', 'such', 'degradation', 'darkness', 'drama', 'points', 'question', 'turmoil', 'quarrel', 'just', 'few', 'ideas', 'consider', 'Faith', 'said', 'personal', 'matter', 'person', 'divine', 'figure', 'probably', 'more', 'correct', 'approach', 'one', 'other', 'free', 'will', 'believed', 'exist', 'then', 'can', 'choose', 'own', 'methods', 'seek', 'answers', 'try', 'find', 'what', 'truths', 'are', 'would', 'offer', 'far', 'greater', 'tragedy', 'so', 'few', 'humans', 'stop', 'point', 'ask', 'what', 'truth', 'greatest', 'mass', 'humanity', 'accepts', 'what', 'truth', 'passive', 'submission', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'taught', 'How', 'can', 'examine', 'truths', 'beliefs', 'grip', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'are', 'Canada', 'finest', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'dramas', 'together', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'provocative', 'well', 'written', 'dialogues', 'Superbly', 'acted', 'will', 'linger', 'mind', 'long', 'time']",The Quarrel

187961,AEB45TKHZI37F,1572527242,Nathan,"[22, 23]","The Quarrel, taking place in the late 40's, is the story of two Jewish Holocaust survivors who have both lost their entire family during it.  For one of them, the experience bolstered his faith in God until it was all  that he had, while in the other it killed whatever faith in God he had had  left. The second man, Chaim, is now a writer who has come to Montreal to  publicize his book, when he bumps into the other, Hersh, who he believed  dead in the Holocaust.  Hersh is now the head of the local Jewish community  and Yeshiva.  This film is about an afternoon spent together between them  and their quarrel over their friendship and faith.I believe that this  movie was originally either a short story or a play, and it was probably  better as such, because it doesn't make the big screen too well.  It is too  slowly paced and is basically one big discussion with little background  music (though what's there is quite good).However, its points are  still remarkably relevant to Jews in todays world over fifty years later.  We watched this in my Bible class, and it left our teacher crying.  I  definitely recommend this film to everyone, but especially those who lost  family or faith in the Holocaust and to Jews wondering about their  faith.Even if you only watch it once, go out and rent or buy The Quarrel",5,Wonderful!,947894400,"01 15, 2000",2000,1318,"['Quarrel', 'taking', 'place', 'late', '40', 'story', 'two', 'Jewish', 'Holocaust', 'survivors', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'entire', 'family', 'one', 'experience', 'bolstered', 'faith', 'God', 'was', 'had', 'other', 'killed', 'faith', 'God', 'had', 'had', 'left', 'second', 'man', 'Chaim', 'now', 'writer', 'who', 'come', 'Montreal', 'publicize', 'book', 'when', 'other', 'Hersh', 'who', 'believed', 'dead', 'Holocaust', 'Hersh', 'now', 'head', 'local', 'Jewish', 'community', 'Yeshiva', 'film', 'afternoon', 'spent', 'together', 'quarrel', 'friendship', 'faith.I', 'believe', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'short', 'story', 'play', 'was', 'probably', 'better', 'such', ""n't"", 'make', 'big', 'screen', 'too', 'well', 'too', 'slowly', 'paced', 'basically', 'one', 'big', 'discussion', 'little', 'background', 'music', 'what', 'quite', 'good', '.However', 'points', 'are', 'still', 'remarkably', 'relevant', 'Jews', 'todays', 'world', 'fifty', 'years', 'later', 'watched', 'Bible', 'class', 'left', 'teacher', 'crying', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'film', 'everyone', 'especially', 'who', 'lost', 'family', 'faith', 'Holocaust', 'Jews', 'wondering', 'faith.Even', 'only', 'watch', 'once', 'go', 'out', 'rent', 'buy', 'Quarrel']",The Quarrel

Coming from the hand of Rabbi Joseph Telushkin we should expect it to be humorous, realistic, and serious and ""The Quarrel"" is all of these. These aspects grow considerably at film's end - love the Amish thing from Hersh and Chaim's disclosure of the last time he prayed.

Both are directed at uplifting man since G-d needs nothing from us.But G-d is ultimately necessary because, as Chaim learns, all actions are morally equivalent without G-d's judgment as to which are good and which are bad (reason is limited and rationalism is an ethical quicksand like no other; take it from a sufferer like me).
