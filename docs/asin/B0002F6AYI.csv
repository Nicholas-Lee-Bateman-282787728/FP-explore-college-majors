I can't believe I paid $10 for something so cheaply made.  It was very short and it reminded me of Flintstones-type animation.  The gags were just stupid; one of the witches said they should go to a hotel and order ""broom service.""  Geez.  It's just not worth the money; we won't be watching this again and now I just feel like I wasted $10.",1,"NOT for the whole family, under 5 only, just not funny",1287878400,"10 24, 2010",2010,483,"['bought', 'based', 'other', 'reviews', 'said', 'was', 'fun', 'whole', 'family', 'was', ""n't"", 'fun', 'anyone', 'Even', '3', 'year', 'old', 'was', 'bored', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'paid', '10', 'something', 'so', 'cheaply', 'made', 'was', 'very', 'short', 'reminded', 'Flintstones-type', 'animation', 'gags', 'were', 'just', 'stupid', 'one', 'witches', 'said', 'should', 'go', 'hotel', 'order', 'broom', 'service', 'Geez', 'just', 'not', 'money', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'watching', 'again', 'now', 'just', 'feel', 'wasted', '10']",Witches In Stitches abe
832504,A6GMEO3VRY51S,B0002F6AYI,microjoe,"[22, 22]","This is a fun little Halloween story about 3 sisters that are witches. Two of the sisters are incompetent and  seem to get their spells a little mixed up. The other sister is in charge and very powerful indeed. The other two are trying to make pumpkin pies to throw at trick or treaters when they accidentally turn their sister into a pumpkin that rolls away and they lose her. Since she is a pumpkin, she cannot perform magic. They are tempted to leave her like that since she is so mean, but they eventually decide to track her down and try to help her. In the meantime a young boy finds the witch-pumpkin and thinks she is a battery operated toy talking pumpkin and uses her as the centerpiece for his Halloween party.All in all a good story for the holiday, very funny, and no scary moments for smaller kids. 25 minutes long. Lots of laughs for the older ones, cute characters, good jokes and sight gags.
