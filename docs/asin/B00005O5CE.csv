I enjoyed it a lot and decided to try some of his other work. The Penalty sounded the most interesting since Chaney's legendary makeup skills are used not on his face but on his legs. He is nothing short of amazing in his role as a double amputee/crime lord. Indeed, this is one of those movies that is carried by an actor's charisma.Unfortunately, the supporting cast is not nearly as fascinating as Blizzard. With the exception of Rose, they are just the standard gangster film characters. (The eager young man, the innocent young girl, the dogged investigater) Whenever Blizzard is onscreen, the movie really works and the viewer misses him when he is not there. Chaney takes a completely horrid character and makes him almost likable. It's no wonder this was the movie that made Chaney a real star.The plot involves Chaney's character, Blizzard, seeking revenge on the imcompetant doctor who amputated Blizzard's legs at the beginning of the movie. Meanwhile, the police are investigating Blizzard, hoping to bring down his entire gang.The print is nice enough, quite watchable. The soundtrack is another matter. It consists of NIN sounding loops and drumbeats. Some silent movie fans are purists when it comes to music and some are not. I am in the middle. I would have preferred a more traditional soundtrack (the clangs and bangs are distracting sometimes) but it did not wholly hamper my enjoyment of the film. I just want to give a warning to any traditionalists.The DVD boasts a suprising amount of extras for a silent film. A 1914 western short starring Chaney. I enjoyed seeing how little a western changed between the teens and the fifties! Also,and a brief but well-done tour of Chaney's makeup case. There is a book-to-movie comparison that explains why the ending was changed. (I think the movie would have been stronger if they had kept the original ending.) I won't spoil it of course but I didn't think it was in keeping with the mood of the rest of the movie.All in all, check it out for Chaney. It is an entertaining film and a great piece of film history.",5,Weird and rather fun,1028246400,"08 2, 2002",2002,2165,"['many', 'other', 'movie', 'fans', 'only', 'view', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'was', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'decided', 'try', 'other', 'work', 'Penalty', 'sounded', 'most', 'interesting', 'Chaney', 'legendary', 'makeup', 'skills', 'are', 'used', 'not', 'face', 'legs', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing', 'role', 'double', 'amputee/crime', 'lord', 'Indeed', 'one', 'movies', 'carried', 'actor', 'charisma.Unfortunately', 'supporting', 'cast', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'fascinating', 'Blizzard', 'exception', 'Rose', 'are', 'just', 'standard', 'gangster', 'film', 'characters', 'eager', 'young', 'man', 'innocent', 'young', 'girl', 'dogged', 'investigater', 'Whenever', 'Blizzard', 'onscreen', 'movie', 'really', 'viewer', 'when', 'not', 'there', 'Chaney', 'completely', 'horrid', 'character', 'almost', 'likable', 'wonder', 'was', 'movie', 'made', 'Chaney', 'real', 'star.The', 'plot', 'Chaney', 'character', 'Blizzard', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'imcompetant', 'doctor', 'who', 'amputated', 'Blizzard', 'legs', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Meanwhile', 'police', 'are', 'investigating', 'Blizzard', 'hoping', 'bring', 'down', 'entire', 'gang.The', 'print', 'nice', 'enough', 'quite', 'watchable', 'soundtrack', 'matter', 'NIN', 'sounding', 'loops', 'drumbeats', 'silent', 'movie', 'fans', 'are', 'purists', 'when', 'music', 'are', 'not', 'am', 'middle', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'more', 'traditional', 'soundtrack', 'clangs', 'bangs', 'are', 'distracting', 'sometimes', 'did', 'not', 'wholly', 'hamper', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'just', 'want', 'give', 'warning', 'traditionalists.The', 'DVD', 'suprising', 'amount', 'extras', 'silent', 'film', '1914', 'western', 'short', 'starring', 'Chaney', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'how', 'little', 'western', 'changed', 'teens', 'fifties', 'Also', 'brief', 'well-done', 'tour', 'Chaney', 'makeup', 'case', 'book-to-movie', 'comparison', 'why', 'ending', 'was', 'changed', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'had', 'kept', 'original', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'keeping', 'mood', 'rest', 'movie.All', 'check', 'out', 'Chaney', 'entertaining', 'film', 'great', 'piece', 'film', 'history']",N/A

671450,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B00005O5CE,Anyechka,"[0, 0]","Though this film was made a few years before Lon Chaney became a huge star, when he was still known primarily as a very good character actor, it easily seems like his best surviving pre-stardom film.  In spite of his stardom still being a little bit away, he was given the lead role, and did such a wonderful job with it.  I think his performance as the villainous double amputee Blizzard (what a great character name!) ranks up there as being just as compelling and great as his performance in a film like 'The Phantom of the Opera,' 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame,' or 'Tell It to the Marines.'  (It's really amazing to think about the physical pain he put himself through to play a double amputee, in an era long before CGI, sacrificing so much for the sake of his craft.)  As in all of his films, though he's playing a horrible villain, the type of person you'd ordinarily be afraid of, avoid, or make fun of, he brings depth and sensitivity to the role.  Even though Blizzard is a very wicked man, he's not totally inhuman, and does display more human emotions a couple of times.  Underneath the exterior of the tough unbending criminal mastermind, there does exist the heart of someone who isn't completely evil.  He's also a lot more interesting than just about all of the other characters, because of this depth and complexity.  After all, when was Lon not great?As a young boy, Blizzard's legs were unnecessarily amputated following a traffic accident, and when he was coming out of the operation, he overheard the doctor and his young assistant arguing about how this was an unnecessary operation.  Twenty-seven years later, he's an evil criminal overlord on San Francisco's Barbary Coast, obsessed not only with building his criminal empire and taking control of the entire city but also with finally getting revenge on the doctor who ruined his life.  He gets his chance when he sees an advertisement in the paper (under the terribly old-fashioned ""Male Help Wanted"" section of the help wanted ads) for a model to sit for a sculpture depicting Satan.  The young sculptor, Barbara, is none other than the doctor's daughter.  Blizzard's plans for revenge soon come to include Barbara's boyfriend Wilmot, who is rather old-school and wants Barbara to give up her career as an artist to marry him and have a family.  While Blizzard is plotting to seduce Barbara and get her father to cut off Wilmot's legs so they can be grafted onto him, all while still hatching an elaborate plot to take over the city, he's also falling for Rose, a woman who was originally hired to investigate his evil plans.  Because Blizzard isn't totally evil, Rose comes to develop feelings for him as well, and starts having second thoughts about ratting on him.  All of this makes for a great vintage macabre film, complete with a very creepy atmospheric soundtrack.  It starts off well and just gets even better and better, more and more intense and dramatic, as it goes along.  Unfortunately, there's an incredibly ridiculous and implausible plot twist at the end (which was foreshadowed in the beginning of the film), which probably seemed silly even by 1920 standards.  It leads to what I consider a disappointing ending, but everything that comes prior to the final reel is so wonderful that the lame ending doesn't cancel it out.Bonus features are plentiful and include trailers, the surviving footage of the 1919 film 'The Miracle Man,' a photo gallery, information on the novel on which the film was based (and which helps to clear up some confusions and questions the viewer might have, like why those women are making all of those hats), the 1914 short 'By the Sun's Rays,' and an essay by Chaney biographer Michael Blake, who also provides a short video tour of Lon's makeup case and the costume he used in this film.",5,Classic vintage macabre,1208304000,"04 16, 2008",2008,3811,"['film', 'was', 'made', 'few', 'years', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'became', 'huge', 'star', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'known', 'primarily', 'very', 'good', 'character', 'actor', 'easily', 'best', 'surviving', 'pre-stardom', 'film', 'spite', 'stardom', 'still', 'being', 'little', 'bit', 'away', 'was', 'given', 'lead', 'role', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'think', 'performance', 'villainous', 'double', 'amputee', 'Blizzard', 'what', 'great', 'character', 'name', 'up', 'there', 'being', 'just', 'compelling', 'great', 'performance', 'film', ""'The"", 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Hunchback', 'Notre', 'Dame', ""'Tell"", 'Marines', 'really', 'amazing', 'think', 'physical', 'pain', 'put', 'play', 'double', 'amputee', 'era', 'long', 'before', 'CGI', 'sacrificing', 'so', 'much', 'sake', 'craft', 'films', 'playing', 'horrible', 'villain', 'type', 'person', ""'d"", 'ordinarily', 'be', 'afraid', 'avoid', 'make', 'fun', 'depth', 'sensitivity', 'role', 'Even', 'Blizzard', 'very', 'wicked', 'man', 'not', 'totally', 'inhuman', 'display', 'more', 'human', 'emotions', 'couple', 'times', 'exterior', 'tough', 'unbending', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'exist', 'heart', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'completely', 'evil', 'also', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'just', 'other', 'characters', 'depth', 'complexity', 'when', 'was', 'Lon', 'not', 'great', 'young', 'boy', 'Blizzard', 'legs', 'were', 'unnecessarily', 'amputated', 'following', 'traffic', 'accident', 'when', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'operation', 'overheard', 'doctor', 'young', 'assistant', 'arguing', 'how', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'operation', 'Twenty-seven', 'years', 'later', 'evil', 'criminal', 'overlord', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Barbary', 'Coast', 'obsessed', 'not', 'only', 'building', 'criminal', 'empire', 'taking', 'control', 'entire', 'city', 'also', 'finally', 'getting', 'revenge', 'doctor', 'who', 'ruined', 'life', 'chance', 'when', 'advertisement', 'paper', 'terribly', 'old-fashioned', 'Male', 'Help', 'Wanted', 'section', 'help', 'wanted', 'ads', 'model', 'sit', 'sculpture', 'depicting', 'Satan', 'young', 'sculptor', 'Barbara', 'none', 'other', 'doctor', 'daughter', 'Blizzard', 'plans', 'revenge', 'soon', 'come', 'include', 'Barbara', 'boyfriend', 'Wilmot', 'who', 'rather', 'old-school', 'Barbara', 'give', 'up', 'career', 'artist', 'marry', 'have', 'family', 'Blizzard', 'plotting', 'seduce', 'Barbara', 'get', 'father', 'cut', 'off', 'Wilmot', 'legs', 'can', 'be', 'grafted', 'still', 'hatching', 'elaborate', 'plot', 'take', 'over', 'city', 'also', 'falling', 'Rose', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'originally', 'hired', 'investigate', 'evil', 'plans', 'Blizzard', ""n't"", 'totally', 'evil', 'Rose', 'develop', 'feelings', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'second', 'thoughts', 'ratting', 'great', 'vintage', 'macabre', 'film', 'complete', 'very', 'creepy', 'atmospheric', 'soundtrack', 'off', 'well', 'just', 'even', 'better', 'better', 'more', 'more', 'intense', 'dramatic', 'along', 'Unfortunately', 'incredibly', 'ridiculous', 'implausible', 'plot', 'twist', 'end', 'was', 'foreshadowed', 'beginning', 'film', 'probably', 'seemed', 'silly', 'even', '1920', 'standards', 'what', 'consider', 'disappointing', 'ending', 'everything', 'prior', 'final', 'reel', 'so', 'wonderful', 'lame', 'ending', ""n't"", 'cancel', 'out.Bonus', 'features', 'are', 'plentiful', 'include', 'trailers', 'surviving', 'footage', '1919', 'film', 'Miracle', 'Man', 'photo', 'gallery', 'information', 'novel', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'clear', 'up', 'confusions', 'questions', 'viewer', 'might', 'have', 'why', 'women', 'are', 'making', 'hats', '1914', 'short', 'Sun', 'Rays', 'essay', 'Chaney', 'biographer', 'Michael', 'Blake', 'who', 'also', 'short', 'video', 'tour', 'Lon', 'makeup', 'case', 'costume', 'used', 'film']",N/A
671451,AH9K6PPVZKVY3,B00005O5CE,Barbara (Burkowsky) Underwood,"[0, 1]","The unusual story for ""The Penalty"" was taken from a novel by a popular author of the early 20th century, but it is the star and legendary character actor, Lon Chaney, who really makes this film unforgettable.  Before his most famous roles as the Hunchback of Notre Dame and the Phantom of the Opera, Chaney's most impressive and highly-acclaimed performance was in this film, ""The Penalty"", in which he plays a double amputee and criminal mastermind with chilling conviction.  In fact, next to his portrayal of a Chinese man in ""Shadows"" in 1922, his role in ""The Penalty"" is probably one of his most striking and poignant, especially as he uses no make-up to disguise his face in this film.  This gives him a chance to express the warped-minded criminal character simply with facial expressions and other gestures, while stunning the audience with his realistic movements on stumps and crutches to portray the accident victim whose legs were amputated at the knees when he was a child.  Swearing hateful revenge for the doctor who needlessly amputated his legs, this frightening criminal character schemes his plots while a female agent goes undercover to find out how he operates.  Although somewhat dark and oppressive due to Chaney's overwhelming performance of the evil `Blizzard', there are still romance and intriguing plots in this interesting, though unlikely, story.  The sombre mood is emphasized by an unusual modern musical score which seems to add some eeriness to the atmosphere.  It is already eerie enough to see Chaney with cut-off legs, even when one knows that he is walking on his knees with his legs tightly strapped back behind him under loose pants and jacket.  There are no tricks or special angles used:  this is just another aspect of Chaney's amazing abilities of transformation which impressed audiences and fellow-actors so much in the 1920s that a humorous phrase was coined, namely ""Don't step on that spider - it might be Lon Chaney!""  Such was his physical skill to portray amputees, cripples and disfigurements, and ""The Penalty"" gives us a fascinating glimpse into this extraordinary art of a unique silent film legend.  To highlight this point, this DVD has some interesting bonus material which provides ample background information to the film, as well as excerpts from other rare old films in which Chaney appeared.  In itself an excellent example of a silent film, the picture quality of ""The Penalty"" is also very good throughout, and with the exceptional music and Chaney's outstanding performance, this DVD rates full marks and will surely leave a deep impression on every viewer.",5,Quite unusual and most fascinating,1203465600,"02 20, 2008",2008,2625,"['unusual', 'story', 'Penalty', 'was', 'taken', 'novel', 'popular', 'author', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'star', 'legendary', 'character', 'actor', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'who', 'really', 'film', 'unforgettable', 'most', 'famous', 'roles', 'Hunchback', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Chaney', 'most', 'impressive', 'highly-acclaimed', 'performance', 'was', 'film', 'Penalty', 'double', 'amputee', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'chilling', 'conviction', 'fact', 'next', 'portrayal', 'Chinese', 'man', 'Shadows', '1922', 'role', 'Penalty', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'striking', 'poignant', 'especially', 'make-up', 'disguise', 'face', 'film', 'chance', 'express', 'warped-minded', 'criminal', 'character', 'simply', 'facial', 'expressions', 'other', 'gestures', 'stunning', 'audience', 'realistic', 'movements', 'stumps', 'crutches', 'portray', 'accident', 'victim', 'legs', 'were', 'amputated', 'knees', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'Swearing', 'hateful', 'revenge', 'doctor', 'who', 'needlessly', 'amputated', 'legs', 'frightening', 'criminal', 'character', 'plots', 'female', 'agent', 'undercover', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'somewhat', 'dark', 'oppressive', 'due', 'Chaney', 'overwhelming', 'performance', 'evil', 'Blizzard', 'are', 'still', 'romance', 'intriguing', 'plots', 'interesting', 'unlikely', 'story', 'sombre', 'mood', 'emphasized', 'unusual', 'modern', 'musical', 'score', 'add', 'eeriness', 'atmosphere', 'already', 'eerie', 'enough', 'see', 'Chaney', 'cut-off', 'legs', 'even', 'when', 'one', 'walking', 'knees', 'legs', 'tightly', 'strapped', 'back', 'loose', 'pants', 'jacket', 'are', 'tricks', 'special', 'angles', 'used', 'just', 'aspect', 'Chaney', 'amazing', 'abilities', 'transformation', 'impressed', 'audiences', 'fellow-actors', 'so', 'much', '1920s', 'humorous', 'phrase', 'was', 'coined', 'namely', 'Do', ""n't"", 'step', 'spider', 'might', 'be', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Such', 'was', 'physical', 'skill', 'portray', 'amputees', 'cripples', 'disfigurements', 'Penalty', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', 'extraordinary', 'art', 'unique', 'silent', 'film', 'legend', 'highlight', 'point', 'DVD', 'interesting', 'bonus', 'material', 'ample', 'background', 'information', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'excerpts', 'other', 'rare', 'old', 'films', 'Chaney', 'appeared', 'excellent', 'example', 'silent', 'film', 'picture', 'quality', 'Penalty', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'exceptional', 'music', 'Chaney', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'DVD', 'rates', 'full', 'marks', 'will', 'surely', 'leave', 'deep', 'impression', 'viewer']",N/A
671452,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B00005O5CE,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[1, 1]","Lon Chaney was one of the very few multi-talented stars that Hollywood had in its early years. He truly was. Not only was he a great actor, but he was also a master make-up artist, the one that opened the doors to the next to come. If you don't believe me, then I urge you to watch ""Mr. Wu"" (1927), ""The Phantom of the Opera"" (1925), ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1923), and many others -- not in vain he was referred to as ""the Man of the Thousand Faces.""  He had a remarkable career that was sadly cut short due to cancer, presumably caused by his excessive smoking. His legacy is there, however, and, for our great luck, ""The Penalty,"" one of his brilliant silent classics, is now available in a glorious Blu-Ray edition, thanks to the folks at Kino Lorber.The story takes place in San Francisco, then known as ""the richest city in the Western World.""  It begins with: ""A Victim of the city traffic. It was young Dr. Ferris' first serious case.""  We then realize that Dr. Ferris (Charles Clary) had just amputated both legs above the knee from young Blizzard. Unfortunately, Dr. Ferris is told by another doctor - his senior - that he made a mistake, that there was only a contusion at the base of the skull. Sadly, young Blizzrad hears this private conversation and he complains to his parents, but there is a cover-up in which the kid is blamed of being under the effects of medication, and he doesn't know what he is saying or thought he heard.Twenty seven years later, Blizzard (Lon Chaney) is now ""the lord and master of the underground,"" despite the fact that he is missing both legs above the knee. He is able to walk and has a sharp, criminal mind. For this reason, Lichtenstein (Milton Ross), from the Federal Secret Service - who refers to Blizzard as the ""cripple from hell"" --, assigns agent Rose (Ethel Grey Terry) to infiltrate his organization. Lichtenstein claims that Blizzard ""gathered up his dance hall girls and he's put them to work in his house, making thousands of hats."" He wants to know why. At the same time, Blizzard, through one of his spies, was told that Barbara (Claire Adams), Dr. Ferris' daughter, who is now a sculptor, is looking for a model, so that she can create her masterpiece: a sculpture of Satan. Blizzard manipulates the conditions, so that he can be that model, in order that he can be close to and reach Dr. Ferris, and have his revenge, claiming that ""everything comes to him who waits."" But Blizzard - who calls himself the unhappiest beast in the world"" -- dreams big, pointing out that, ""For my mangled years, the city shall pay.""  With all these factors together, it seems that his patience will reward him big time.If you are lucky to watch ""The Penalty,"" you will discover that Lon Chaney (Leonidas Frank Chaney, 1883-1930) was ahead of his times, so to speak. In recent years, the Academy Awards have been given to actors who defy the odds by imitating handicapped people, which translates into ""great acting."" Chaney would have had a field day with all these actors. Maybe one day he will receive a posthumous Academy Award for his work. The Blu-ray edition of ""The Penalty"" is awesome, and the image quality is crisp - a delight. I also enjoyed watching the footage from San Francisco during the twenties.

671455,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00005O5CE,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 2]","Lon Chaney, an actor known for taking on the roles of characters that were tortured or grotesque and known for horror silent films such as ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""The Unknown"" and ""Laugh, Clown, Laugh"".Known as ""The Master of Makeup"", Chaney has a long list of films in his oeuvre dating back to 1912, but it wasn't until 1919 in which Chaney would receive acclaim as The Frog in ""The Miracle Man"" (unfortunately, the full version of this film is lost, only a few minute footage which is included on the Blu-ray release) but it was in 1920 in which Chaney would star in the crime drama, ""The Penalty"" and solidify his status as one of the most popular actors in America and not a one-hit wonder.The film would also captivate audiences as Chaney, playing a double leg amputee, using a leather harness to strap his two lower legs behind his thigh to two buckets.  While using crutches, he was able to take part in stunts without the use of his legs and feet.  So painful for Lon Chaney to play this role, he could only do this for short periods of time.Based on a pulp novel by Gouverneur Morris (which you can read online here), the film directed by Wallace Worsley and written by Philip Lonergan would be one of the few silent films starring Lon Chaney that many silent film fans have had watched on  home video thanks to Kino (who released the original DVD back in 2001).And in October 2012, Kino Lorber has released ""The Penalty"" on Blu-ray.  Remastered in HD from the 35 mm restoration by the George Eastman House Motion Picture Department.  The film is color tinted according to the surviving instructions and features a new musical score by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra in 2.0 stereo and DTS-HD Master Audio.VIDEO:""The Penalty"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and remastered in HD from the 35 mm restoration print from the George Eastman House Motion Picture Department and is color tinted according to the surviving instructions.  It's important for people to know that Kino is not a company that cleans up their films but presents the film in high definition as provided to them.  They choose films with the best print and so, you can expect prints to have some damage, tears and white specks and occasional hair or dirt that was made permanent during the restoration (at the time, many companies restored the nitrate print by converting it to 35 mm but with all defects included).Fortunately for ""The Penalty"", the film is not in bad shape at all.  There are visible splicing, color tinting was a tad bit saturated at times and  there are white specks but for the most part, I was quite pleased of watching this film in HD and seeing more detail as opposed to the 2001 DVD which had DNR but also a bit of blurring.  But the contrast is good and I saw no major issues when it comes to artifacts or any significant errors.  I'm confident that this Blu-ray release will be the definitive version of ""The Penalty"" to see for quite some time.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Penalty"" features a new musical score by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra in 2.0 Stereo and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  I'm always a fan of Rodney Sauer and the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra's work and I enjoyed their score for this Blu-ray release of ""The Penalty"".The music is fantastic and sounds amazing, crisp and clear via its lossless soundtrack. Rodney Sauer wrote on Nitrateville.com, ""Mont Alto's score for `The Penalty' -- after our previous score for `Les Vampires' -- has had us wallowing in melodrama for most of 2012. But we really like this kind of music, it gives us a great opportunity for emotional playing. This Blu-Ray is also our first recording with my newly acquired Kawai grand piano, though in most of these arrangements, the piano ends up pretty buried. When Lon plays his piano on-screen, you'll hear it a little more to the front. Grand pianos are very inspiring to play, but can be difficult to record.""SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Penalty"" come with the following special features:Chaney's Secrets Revealed - (9:33) Author Michael F. Blake gives a video tour of Chaney's actual make-up case and the costume he wore in ""The Penalty"".""By the Sun's Rays"" - (11:27) A Lon Cheney one-reel western.The Miracle Man- (2:37) The only surviving footage of Lon Chaney's breakthrough 1919 feature ""The Miracle Man"".Lon Chaney Trailers - Featuring a trailer for ""The Big City"" and ""While the City Sleeps"".EXTRAS:""The Penalty"" comes with a slipcase.JUDGMENT CALL:As I tried to put myself in the shoes of those who must have watched this film in 1920, I can certainly see how this film would be chilling to viewers.  A dark and somewhat evil character, Lon Chaney's Blizzard shows viewers the cruelty of the underworld.Viewers get to see how Blizzard is feared as he rules with an iron fist, he has show girls forcibly working under him and how his temper can easily flare to the point of hurting another woman with not so care in the world and the fact that he has this power, he gives this evil grin that surely is a predecessor of the evil grin that Jack Nicholson is known for in his chilling films such as ""The Shining"".And while people die in this film, it also is quite interesting to see how police are featured in the film.  The criminals are always a step ahead of the police, so their best chance is Rose, an agent sent to infiltrate Blizzard's operations and manages to do it.While some may see this as a positive role for a woman officer in an early silent film, unfortunately, while she is successful to infiltrate and do her own recon, she makes a key mistake which gives herself away.  To make things worse, she falls for Blizzard's charms and is torn between duty and love for him.  So, much that when he plays the organ, Rose kneels down to play the piano's pedals for him.There are quite a few scenes that are implausible and personally, there are times that I wondered that if all these women do not like to be treated so badly, what stops dozens of them from getting revenge as he is a man with no feet and on crutches.  Suffice to say, this  is one of those films one shouldn't think hard of why these people do not do things this way or that way, just think of Blizzard as this evil power that men and women fear, despite his physical disability.But what makes this film so entertaining is to see Lon Cheney giving an amazing performance.  A man who had to undergo tremendous pain just to walk on his knees and take part in many stunts, I was just amazed of how much he was able to accomplish.  But it's his performance that the film rides on his shoulders and he manages to succeed and making the film worth one's time to watch.  And the scene of Blizzard posing as satan is quite creepy.As for the Blu-ray release, for silent film fans, to have a silent Lon Cheney film on Blu-ray is fantastic, considering his breakthrough film ""The Miracle Man"" is lost.  But it's great to see the surviving footage of the film included on this Blu-ray plus one of his earlier shorts from 1914, the western ""By the Sun's Rays"" included as well.  Especially a video tour of Chaneys' actual makeup case and his costume used on ""The Penalty"".Picture quality on this Blu-ray release is much better in detail and contrast over its 2001 DVD counterpart and the new score in lossless audio by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra is well-done.Overall, Cheney's performance in ""The Penalty"" is impressive even today, over 90-years-later, how one actor can perform a role with so much pain but yet give a commanding performance is a testament to how amazing an actor he was during that era.  And it's a gangster film that probably was dark and terrifying for its time.""The Penalty"" is another welcomed addition to the George Eastman House titles on Blu-ray courtesy of Kino Lorber.  And to have a silent Lon Cheney film on Blu-ray is another win for silent film fans who have wanted to see more silent films featuring other notable talents in HD.  And one can hope that Kino Lorber continues bringing more films with other silent film stars on Blu-ray!As for this Blu-ray, ""The Penalty"" is recommended!",4,"Cheney's performance in ""The Penalty""

If there had been Academy Awards in 1920 then Lon Chaney's incredible performance would have been a top contender for Best Actor.

The DVD also gives a good insight into the book which the film was based on.

671457,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B00005O5CE,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[0, 0]","The Penalty (1920) revolves around the story of a young boy who, though a accident, has his legs mistakenly amputated by a doctor. The boy grows up to be Blizzard (Chaney), a tough, ruthless mobster and crime lord. With bitterness and hatred consuming his character, Blizzard plans to exact revenge on the Dr.Farris, the one who cut off his legs many years ago. Blizzard also plans to cause mayhem and destruction within an all out takeover of the city with his henchmen's assistance.Lon Chaney really fit his title of the man of a thousand faces, taking on various roles and bringing so much life to his roles. He had that ability to transform himself into his character in a way that is unmatched. In The Penalty, he has that sinister, grotesque kind of role he seemed to be perfect for.  As the character, Blizzard, there is something about that wicked, cruel smile that says infinitely more than words could possibly capture, as if the wheels of his mind are spinning with plans of revenge.  Chaney's character is personified by his hatred toward his fate. At one point, Chaney's character shows up for an advertisement for a model who might ""resemble Satan.""The movie's title, at first, appears to be a reference to Chaney's plan, but this is a bit misleading, as there is a twist at the end. Some have commented that they didn't like the ending, but I thought it was a great way to finish the film.There are other great aspects to this film.

He was a master of mime, of storytelling without words. He had one of the most expressive pairs of hands in history. He was, by the standards of the 21st century, a stylized, broad, melodramatic actor, but in the special, very rich, context of his time, he was one of the greatest. In ""The Penalty"" he pushes the envelope once again as a demonic master criminal who is so evil he is hired to pose for a sculptress as she models a portrait bust of Satan! The plot of ""The Penalty"" is downright operatic, full of wild action and heightened emotion. The denouement is questionable enough,I feel, to have raised some eyebrows even when the film was new, but the rest of the experience more than compensates for that fact.

Hickey,"[2, 2]","Watching this film before reading up on it (which, as another [...] viewer has noted, is the most satisfying way to encounter a Lon Chaney picture), I assumed this film was made circa 1927 and was a little surprised by the vintage costumes.  For 1920, THE PENALTY is a superior achievement.The plot is far superior to PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, and not only moves swiftly but also is filled with surprises right to the end.  And the ending indeed rings more true than that of its popular novel source material.One explanation for the success of villainous Blizzard in San Francisco's crime district is that the ""best undercover agent in the police department"" is so inept.  And the hats subplot is rendered ludicrous by the fact that anyone could acquire a hat that had fallen off a crook.  Still, bumbling ""homeland security"" and the terrorism of a city bring unexpected currency to this story's more far-fetched elements.Lon Chaney's Blizzard is a remarkable creation.  He visually exudes evil and menace, yet (an apparent thread through many of Lon Chaney's films) transcends society's contempt by revealing a sympathetic soul underneath.  His acting is credibly natural, despite his legs being strapped back at the knees, and it is his sheer physical grace (akin to Keaton's, Fairbank's, and Gilbert's) that contributes to his power and charm as a presence on the silent screen.",5,at his fascinating best,1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,1377,"['Watching', 'film', 'reading', 'up', '[', ']', 'viewer', 'noted', 'most', 'satisfying', 'way', 'encounter', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'picture', 'assumed', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'circa', '1927', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'vintage', 'costumes', '1920', 'PENALTY', 'superior', 'achievement.The', 'plot', 'far', 'superior', 'PHANTOM', 'THE', 'OPERA', 'not', 'only', 'swiftly', 'also', 'filled', 'surprises', 'right', 'end', 'ending', 'indeed', 'rings', 'more', 'true', 'popular', 'novel', 'source', 'material.One', 'explanation', 'success', 'villainous', 'Blizzard', 'San', 'Francisco', 'crime', 'district', 'best', 'undercover', 'agent', 'police', 'department', 'so', 'inept', 'hats', 'subplot', 'rendered', 'ludicrous', 'fact', 'anyone', 'could', 'acquire', 'hat', 'had', 'fallen', 'off', 'crook', 'Still', 'bumbling', 'homeland', 'security', 'terrorism', 'city', 'bring', 'unexpected', 'currency', 'story', 'more', 'far-fetched', 'elements.Lon', 'Chaney', 'Blizzard', 'remarkable', 'creation', 'visually', 'evil', 'menace', 'yet', 'apparent', 'thread', 'many', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'films', 'society', 'contempt', 'revealing', 'sympathetic', 'soul', 'underneath', 'acting', 'credibly', 'natural', 'legs', 'being', 'strapped', 'back', 'knees', 'sheer', 'physical', 'grace', 'akin', 'Keaton', 'Fairbank', 'Gilbert', 'power', 'charm', 'presence', 'silent', 'screen']",N/A

671462,A1UW6RBUW0MDLV,B00005O5CE,Michael C. Browning,"[4, 4]","This film and this DVD reissue have already received vy competent reviews from prior critics, so I cannot add much. This is one of the best restorations I've seen, superbly mastered and artisically tinted. The music is extraordinary, very well coordinated with the action. I liked it a lot. It reminded me of ""Tubular Bells"" in Friedkin's ""The Exorcist."" Chaney is simply astounding in this film. He is known as the Man of a Thousand Faces and most people meet him in his heavily made-up roles as the Hunchback of Notre Dame and the Phantom of the Opera. Here he is himself, just his own face, his own acting skill against the camera lense, and he is astounding. This is one of the great, great silent films and I was reminded of Gloria Swanson's immortal line in ""Sunset Boulevard."" ""Back then we didn't need sound. We had FACES."" Chaney's gymnastics as a legless cripple are tremendous -- he climbs stairs on crutches and twice lifts himself by sheer arm-strength up a series of pegs driven in a wall, like a giant spider -- but in some way they are the least part of the film. It's his face, his acting, his sheer power that carries the film along. It's all expressions, all shoulders and arms and hands. It's an astounding performance. The only drawback is that he just blows everybody else away, every other actor in the film seems made out of cardboard, compared to Chaney. I agree with a prior reviewer: ""WHAT ABOUT THE HATS?"" That part of the film doesn't make much sense, though it does afford Chaney one of the most terrific and scary moments in his career, when he threatens a hatmaker, wobbling and towering above her like a huge monster on a table. The ending is silly, but one is left with the disturbing and unforgettable sense of having seen something truly demonic briefly released on film. An astounding and powerful film, a real tour-de-force, handsomely restored and presented with many fascinating extras. Even the subtitles are curiously horrific.A minor note: Rex Beach, who seems to have collaborated on the screenplay, went on to promote Coral Gables as a real estate development south of Miami, along with William Jennings Bryan.

671463,A2H9LUUCYE0KJC,B00005O5CE,Mr Peter G George,"[10, 11]","The Penalty is a superb Lon Chaney film. It has a really sinister, creepy atmosphere and a central performance from `The Man of a Thousand Faces' which is amongst his best. Chaney, in the role of Blizzard, does not use elaborate face makeup, although his face still takes on an incredible number of varied expressions. What makes his performance so memorable is that he is able to convincingly play the part of someone who has had both legs amputated above the knee. Chaney is totally believable as he moves around on crutches. He shows an incredible strength in using only his arms to climb ladders and ropes. Chaney's performance is not merely a physical tour-de-force. His portrayal of the bitter criminal mastermind does not descend into caricature. The viewer sympathises with him even as his violent actions make him repellent.The story of The Penalty is lurid to say the least and at times rather far fetched. It is basically a story of Blizzard seeking revenge for the unnecessary amputation of his legs as a child. This revenge involves an elaborate plot to trap the doctor responsible for his plight. Alongside this revenge plot Blizzard plans to take over the city of San Francisco using `Reds' to fight the police while his gang robs the banks and jewellery stores. The story is far from plausible, but stories of criminal masterminds rarely are. It is however hugely enjoyable, exciting and also at times quite shockingly violent for a silent movie.The print used for the Kino DVD is very good. It is nicely colour tinted and is clear and sharp. The score, composed by Michael Polher, is modern in style and takes a bit of getting used to. It has a thumping beat for large parts of the film, which can be a bit annoying, but on the whole the score fits in quite well with the mood of the film. This DVD has a lot of extras. The best of these is Chaney's one-reel 1914 Western, By the Sun's Rays, which shows the younger Chaney already playing the villain. There is also an interesting video tour showing Chaney's makeup case and the costume he wore in The Penalty. Other extras include a photo gallery a good essay on The Penalty. This is a fine DVD with one of Chaney's best films.

As the renowned Chaney historian, Michael F Blake, reiterates many times; Chaney was never a horror actor.  Neither the Hunchback (incidentally eagerly awaited in a new DVD presentation-hint hint KINO)nor Phantom are horror films.The penalty is witness to the input, perfection and endurance that Chaney would bring to a role never giving into anything less than startling realism which seems even more fantastic by today`s standards.  His perfomances still make the viewer`s head nod in almost disbelief.No one equaled Chaney in terms of his acting standards when he was alive and there has certainly never been anyone since.The Penalty is a fast paced superb film which must be seen and not described.The DVD is excellent value and as we have come to expect from KINO only the best surviving 35mm elements have been used.  There are great extra features one of which is the examination of Lon`s make up case by Michael F Blake.

671466,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,B00005O5CE,Robin Simmons,"[16, 16]","Kino on Video has carved a niche for themselves with their fine digital transfers of art, foreign and classic silent films. Four of the towering icons of early cinema were Lon Chaney, John Barrymore, Douglas Fairbanks and Rudolph Valentino. Now, each of these stars has a seminal film freshly available for a new generation to discover and enjoy on DVD (along with a generous sampling of choice supplemental material).A few years before his death, I got to know Allan Dwan, the legendary film pioneer and director of over 400 features films, who by then was well into his 90s. After a special screening of a his 1922 &quot;Robin Hood,&quot; a spectacular comic epic adventure starring Douglas Fairbanks, Dwan told me how he discovered Lon Chaney. &quot;I was at Universal and picked up a new prop man,&quot; he said. &quot;Suddenly, every day after work, I noticed a stranger leaving the set where we were shooting. A stranger with a missing leg, or eye, or odd nose, hair or teeth. It turned out to be Chaney in his home-made makeup effects. I said, 'You wanna be in front of the camera?' and began putting him in small parts where he was immediately noticed -- not so much for his makeup, but rather his personality. So I took the tip and featured him. He had that mysterious hidden thing that certain people have. He was a star from the very beginning.&quot;When I saw &quot;PENALTY&quot; I understood what Dwan meant about Chaney's sheer force of personalty. Shot in 1920, this Wallace Worsley (&quot;Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;) directed thriller features Chaney as Blizzard, an embittered double amputee and criminal mastermind out to avenge the incompetent doctor who cut off his legs when he was a boy. Blizzard befriends the surgeon's artist daughter and serves as model for her sculpture of Satan. All the while biding his time to enact his demonic revenge. Chaney is electrifying. The disc is loaded with essays, photos, clips, shorts, trailers, a video tour of Chaney's makeup case and a look at the double amputee rig and costume. The atmospheric music score is by Michael Polher.  A DVD for the digital library.

(especially those bizarre expressionist original trailers) HOWEVER, I found the quasi-industrial-ambient score (the only option here, unlike some other Kino silent discs) to be, at best, ill-suited and mismatched, and, at worst, a jarring distraction. Did the composer watch the film with any interest? I argue that Lon Chaney's performance does not need klanging music and sobbing voices to communicate. His face and body language speak VOLUMES. Isn't that a significant aspect of silent film? Now, I'm not suggesting it should be honky-tonk piano accompaniment, but, this is as UNsubtle as it gets. I tried to maintain an open mind and I feel it does work in a few spots but it absolutely CRUSHES the first sequence in the hat-building sweat shop. And it distracts from the remarkably (especially for its time) fluid cuts from scene to scene. So, I recommend this with serious reservations. I couldn't truly lose myself in this example of a bygone era with a substandard example of a modern one grafted onto it. Mind you, I do realize I could just put the whole thing on ""mute"" and be done with it.
