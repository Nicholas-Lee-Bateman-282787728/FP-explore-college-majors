I have the europeon version that is 20 minutes longer and has alot more information on it. That version in at 50Hz and it did work on my panasonic vt television as well as my panasonic 3d blu ray player. it has a extra feature , the making of , on it too. Not all players or tv's can handle 50 hz blu rays though. If you want to play it safe then get the u.s. one. As to why they felt the need to cut out 20 minutes on the u.s. version ,when they didn't have to is beyond me. My version is filled with great cgi effects , some of which are very amazing. It tells of the evolution and change in the terrasaurs over 150 million years , from small reptiles to warm blooded tailess creatures filling many niches in nature. So it's worth owning for the info alone and the 3d scenes look great too. Plus it's done by david attenbourgh who is just a awesome narrator and scientist who has many credits under his belt.",5,imax show that flies well.,1342137600,"07 13, 2012",2012,1030,"['good', 'well', 'made', 'british', 'show', 'was', 'made', 'imax', 'type', 'screens', 'was', 'shown', 'imax', 'screens', 'u.s', 'have', 'europeon', 'version', '20', 'minutes', 'longer', 'alot', 'more', 'information', 'version', '50Hz', 'did', 'work', 'panasonic', 'vt', 'television', 'as', 'well', 'panasonic', '3d', 'blu', 'ray', 'player', 'extra', 'feature', 'making', 'too', 'Not', 'players', 'tv', 'can', 'handle', '50', 'hz', 'blu', 'want', 'play', 'safe', 'then', 'get', 'u.s.', 'one', 'why', 'felt', 'need', 'cut', 'out', '20', 'minutes', 'u.s.', 'version', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'version', 'filled', 'great', 'cgi', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'amazing', 'evolution', 'change', 'terrasaurs', '150', 'million', 'years', 'small', 'reptiles', 'warm', 'blooded', 'tailess', 'creatures', 'filling', 'many', 'niches', 'nature', 'worth', 'owning', 'info', 'alone', '3d', 'scenes', 'look', 'great', 'too', 'done', 'david', 'attenbourgh', 'who', 'just', 'awesome', 'narrator', 'scientist', 'who', 'many', 'credits', 'belt']",Flying Monsters 3D

But 30min. were cut out or deleted.  I was really mad.  What happened to the other 30 min.?  I suspect they left out those parts where it wasn't 3D.  That's NO EXCUSE!  I could live with some parts not in 3D.  I feel cheated!  False advertising!  At the very least they could have indicated this on the label before people buy it.

1531082,ABGOCL0QVZRUL,B007I1Q4NQ,W. Andrew Terrill,"[16, 19]","This feature is currently being shown in IMAX theaters and is presented in this package in Blu-Ray 2D & 3D as well as DVD format.  Under such circumstances, there is always a danger that spectacular visuals will allow the filmmaker to shortchange the audience on content.  Two words prevent that from occurring in this instance--David Attenborough.  Attenborough is a legendary master filmmaker as well as an unparalleled interpreter of the natural world.  If he has made a bad film in the last forty years I must have missed it, and I do not miss anything that he has been involved with if I can help it.  In this instance, Flying Monsters is a brilliant and technically masterful examination of the lives and evolution of the prehistoric flying reptiles known as pterosaurs. Attenborough suggests that pterosaurs evolved from gliding lizards and that they were initially adapting to feed on the vast clouds of insects found in prehistoric skies.  It was of course inevitable that some life forms would find a way to exploit this abundant food source. He further notes that the earliest pterosaurs were poor fliers and illustrates this point with struggling and awkward Dimorphodons.  Later, as pterosaurs evolved further, they became significantly more aerodynamic and their diet also diversified.  In one particularly funny scene, Attenborough pilots a modern glider next to a giant Quetzalcoatlus. In concluding this stunning and wonderful film, Attenborough expresses doubt that the asteroid strike on earth 65 million years ago was the primary reason for pterosaur extinction.  Rather, he suggests that a more important reason for their passing from the planet was that they were outcompeted by birds.",5,Brilliant and breathtaking,1340150400,"06 20, 2012",2012,1707,"['feature', 'currently', 'being', 'shown', 'IMAX', 'theaters', 'presented', 'package', 'Blu-Ray', '2D', '3D', 'as', 'well', 'DVD', 'format', 'such', 'circumstances', 'always', 'danger', 'spectacular', 'visuals', 'will', 'allow', 'filmmaker', 'shortchange', 'audience', 'content', 'Two', 'words', 'prevent', 'occurring', 'instance', 'David', 'Attenborough', 'Attenborough', 'legendary', 'master', 'filmmaker', 'as', 'well', 'unparalleled', 'interpreter', 'natural', 'world', 'made', 'bad', 'film', 'last', 'forty', 'years', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'do', 'not', 'miss', 'anything', 'been', 'involved', 'can', 'help', 'instance', 'Flying', 'Monsters', 'brilliant', 'technically', 'masterful', 'examination', 'lives', 'evolution', 'prehistoric', 'flying', 'reptiles', 'known', 'pterosaurs', 'Attenborough', 'pterosaurs', 'evolved', 'gliding', 'lizards', 'were', 'initially', 'adapting', 'feed', 'vast', 'clouds', 'insects', 'found', 'prehistoric', 'skies', 'was', 'course', 'inevitable', 'life', 'forms', 'would', 'find', 'way', 'exploit', 'abundant', 'food', 'source', 'further', 'notes', 'earliest', 'pterosaurs', 'were', 'poor', 'fliers', 'point', 'struggling', 'awkward', 'Dimorphodons', 'Later', 'pterosaurs', 'evolved', 'further', 'became', 'significantly', 'more', 'aerodynamic', 'diet', 'also', 'diversified', 'one', 'particularly', 'funny', 'scene', 'Attenborough', 'pilots', 'modern', 'glider', 'next', 'giant', 'Quetzalcoatlus', 'concluding', 'stunning', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Attenborough', 'doubt', 'asteroid', 'strike', 'earth', '65', 'million', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'primary', 'reason', 'pterosaur', 'extinction', 'Rather', 'more', 'important', 'reason', 'passing', 'planet', 'was', 'were', 'outcompeted', 'birds']",Flying Monsters 3D
