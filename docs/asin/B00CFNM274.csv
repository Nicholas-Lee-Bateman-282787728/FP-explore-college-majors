For instance, if you like cookie-cutter movies that you can easily categorize as ""chick flick"", ""romcom"", ""coming of age"" or movies that don't feature complex characters with both strengths and flaws: then you won't want to watch this movie.This is not an unfamiliar story: a superficially normal but mostly dysfunctional family has their rate of change increased by the arrival of an outside influence. In this case, the family is the van End family, a suburban Dutch family.  Father Evert is a mid-level manager in a factory that cranks out a Dutch variant of hot dog called a ""frikandel""), and his wife Etty are deep in the midst of their 25th anniversary preparations. Their oldest son Erwin is a young adult still battling acne and on the verge of moving in with his adoring girlfriend. Youngest son Manuel is a mean-spirited teen fueled by drugs and rebellion. The movie's title character, Eva, is an awkward, introverted high schooler, who seemingly fits in neither at school nor at home. Finally, not physically present, but essential to the story is the memory of another deceased son.The change agent in this movie is German exchange student Veit, who Eva is sponsoring for a two-week stay. Since her pronouncements of his arrival went unheard in the chaotic exchanges of the van End household, his arrival comes as a surprise. Veit's influences are felt by everybody in the van End family. The title tells you exactly what influence Veit has on Eva; this is secondary to his influences on the other family members as the two weeks play out in the movie.Don't be fooled by the DVD cover, which evokes  ""Juno"" or ""Little Miss Sunshine"". While this movie has comedic moments, it is also dark, violent and deals explicitly with issues of sexuality and contains scenes of rather intense violence.Although a Dutch movie with English subtitles, one premise of the student exchange is to allow participants to practice their English; as a result, large portions of the movie are spoken in English.The conclusion of this movie features a cavalcade of events touches everybody in the van End family. The changes are for both better and worse, and director Michiel ten Horn doesn't serve the answers up under a neon sign. You'll have to figure out for yourself who you think the winners and losers are when the smoke clears (literally!).Interesting movie and well worth the 94 minutes you'll spend with the van Ends.Note: Film Movement provided this DVD for review purposes.",4,"Entertaining and intriguing, but not for the faint of heart...",1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,2567,"['Deflowering', 'Eva', 'van', 'End', 'TDEE', 'hereafter', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'everybody', 'instance', 'like', 'cookie-cutter', 'movies', 'can', 'easily', 'categorize', 'chick', 'flick', 'romcom', 'coming', 'age', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'feature', 'complex', 'characters', 'strengths', 'flaws', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'movie.This', 'not', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'superficially', 'normal', 'mostly', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'rate', 'change', 'increased', 'arrival', 'outside', 'influence', 'case', 'family', 'van', 'End', 'family', 'suburban', 'Dutch', 'family', 'Father', 'Evert', 'mid-level', 'manager', 'factory', 'out', 'Dutch', 'variant', 'hot', 'dog', 'called', 'frikandel', 'wife', 'Etty', 'are', 'deep', 'midst', '25th', 'anniversary', 'preparations', 'oldest', 'son', 'Erwin', 'young', 'adult', 'still', 'battling', 'acne', 'verge', 'moving', 'adoring', 'girlfriend', 'Youngest', 'son', 'Manuel', 'mean-spirited', 'teen', 'fueled', 'drugs', 'rebellion', 'movie', 'title', 'character', 'Eva', 'awkward', 'introverted', 'high', 'schooler', 'who', 'seemingly', 'school', 'home', 'Finally', 'not', 'physically', 'present', 'essential', 'story', 'memory', 'deceased', 'son.The', 'change', 'agent', 'movie', 'German', 'exchange', 'student', 'Veit', 'who', 'Eva', 'sponsoring', 'two-week', 'stay', 'pronouncements', 'arrival', 'went', 'unheard', 'chaotic', 'exchanges', 'van', 'End', 'household', 'arrival', 'surprise', 'Veit', 'influences', 'are', 'felt', 'everybody', 'van', 'End', 'family', 'title', 'exactly', 'what', 'influence', 'Veit', 'Eva', 'secondary', 'influences', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'two', 'weeks', 'play', 'out', 'movie.Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Juno', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'movie', 'comedic', 'moments', 'also', 'dark', 'violent', 'deals', 'explicitly', 'issues', 'sexuality', 'scenes', 'rather', 'intense', 'Dutch', 'movie', 'English', 'subtitles', 'one', 'premise', 'student', 'exchange', 'allow', 'participants', 'practice', 'English', 'result', 'large', 'portions', 'movie', 'are', 'spoken', 'English.The', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'cavalcade', 'events', 'touches', 'everybody', 'van', 'End', 'family', 'changes', 'are', 'better', 'worse', 'director', 'Michiel', 'Horn', ""n't"", 'serve', 'answers', 'up', 'neon', 'sign', ""'ll"", 'have', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'think', 'winners', 'losers', 'are', 'when', 'smoke', 'clears', 'literally', '.Interesting', 'movie', 'well', '94', 'minutes', ""'ll"", 'spend', 'van', 'Ends.Note', 'Film', 'Movement', 'provided', 'DVD', 'review', 'purposes']",The Deflowering of Eva van End
1646818,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B00CFNM274,Charles Ashbacher,"[2, 3]","The van End family of five would have to climb a few rungs to reach the level of dysfunctional. There are two boys and one girl with the youngest boy a pot smoking foul-mouthed jerk. He regularly swears at his parents and their reaction is not one of anger but of resignation. The oldest boy is in the process of moving out to live with his girlfriend as they are about to be married. The youngest in the family is 15 year-old Eva, a sad girl that receives no attention or affection from any creature other than her pet rabbit.All of their lives are dramatically altered when Veit, a very attractive and talented foreign exchange student arrives from Germany. Veit is extremely well-mannered and helpful, but everything he says or does simply reminds a van End member of their inadequacies. The youngest boy openly hates him while the oldest feels humiliated when he interacts with Veit, a boy that has already experienced more of life than any of the van Ends have. It is also not the case that the van Ends are poor, their house is quite spacious and they have a private pool, so it appears that they are well off. The marriage is also loveless and from a few of the scenes, apparently sexless as well.Even though Veit is otherwise very kind and considerate, he also pays no attention to Eva, even when she does some unusual things to get someone in the house to pay some attention to her. All five of the van End relationships with Veit come to a peak with each responding in their own way.This movie is quirky and unpredictable, a combination of satire and sadness as the viewer feels empathy and various levels of disgust for four members of the van End family. For Eva, you feel only the deepest sympathy for she clearly wants people to care for her but the other four often act as if she does not exist. They are so dominated by their insecurities that Eva's obvious distress means nothing to them.Although there are some lighter moments, this film is not a comedy; most of the movement is on the track of tragedy. You are constantly rooting for someone to say a kind thing to Eva, she seems forever to be trapped in a world of being totally ignored, the few times when people interact with her are not positive. At the end, Veit is scheduled to leave and the van Ends are prepared to go on with their lives.",5,The perfect person does not make for the perfect relationship,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,2315,"['van', 'End', 'family', 'five', 'would', 'have', 'climb', 'few', 'rungs', 'reach', 'level', 'dysfunctional', 'are', 'two', 'boys', 'one', 'girl', 'youngest', 'boy', 'pot', 'smoking', 'foul-mouthed', 'jerk', 'regularly', 'parents', 'reaction', 'not', 'one', 'anger', 'resignation', 'oldest', 'boy', 'process', 'moving', 'out', 'live', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'be', 'married', 'youngest', 'family', '15', 'year-old', 'Eva', 'sad', 'girl', 'attention', 'affection', 'creature', 'other', 'pet', 'rabbit.All', 'lives', 'are', 'dramatically', 'altered', 'when', 'Veit', 'very', 'attractive', 'talented', 'foreign', 'exchange', 'student', 'Germany', 'Veit', 'extremely', 'well-mannered', 'helpful', 'everything', 'simply', 'reminds', 'van', 'End', 'member', 'inadequacies', 'youngest', 'boy', 'openly', 'oldest', 'feels', 'humiliated', 'when', 'Veit', 'boy', 'already', 'experienced', 'more', 'life', 'van', 'Ends', 'have', 'also', 'not', 'case', 'van', 'Ends', 'are', 'poor', 'house', 'quite', 'spacious', 'have', 'private', 'pool', 'are', 'well', 'off', 'marriage', 'also', 'loveless', 'few', 'scenes', 'apparently', 'sexless', 'well.Even', 'Veit', 'otherwise', 'very', 'kind', 'considerate', 'also', 'attention', 'Eva', 'even', 'when', 'unusual', 'things', 'get', 'someone', 'house', 'pay', 'attention', 'five', 'van', 'End', 'relationships', 'Veit', 'come', 'peak', 'responding', 'own', 'way.This', 'movie', 'quirky', 'unpredictable', 'combination', 'satire', 'sadness', 'viewer', 'feels', 'empathy', 'various', 'levels', 'disgust', 'four', 'members', 'van', 'End', 'family', 'Eva', 'feel', 'only', 'deepest', 'sympathy', 'clearly', 'people', 'care', 'other', 'four', 'often', 'act', 'not', 'exist', 'are', 'so', 'dominated', 'insecurities', 'Eva', 'obvious', 'distress', 'nothing', 'are', 'lighter', 'moments', 'film', 'not', 'comedy', 'most', 'movement', 'track', 'tragedy', 'are', 'constantly', 'rooting', 'someone', 'say', 'kind', 'thing', 'Eva', 'forever', 'be', 'trapped', 'world', 'being', 'totally', 'ignored', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'people', 'interact', 'are', 'not', 'positive', 'end', 'Veit', 'scheduled', 'leave', 'van', 'Ends', 'are', 'prepared', 'go', 'lives']",The Deflowering of Eva van End
1646819,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B00CFNM274,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[1, 1]","The Deflowering of Eva van End is an incredibly strange movie, nothing at all what I expected. It was at times cringe worthy and others touching. There wasn't really a middle ground with this film.From the cover art and description, I expected this to be a tender, quirky coming of age film. A young girl that is misunderstood, maybe not the most beautiful girl in the world, meets a handsome young man. He sees that she has an inner beauty and falls in love with her - they go off into the sunset together. I ended up blending Danny Deckchair and Smiley Face together to get this film. Yeah, that's what I thought. The film is about as far from that sweet story as you could ever imagine.This film is a strange study in human nature. The film opens with what seems like a normal Dutch family at breakfast. There is a lot of conversation in this stark cool kitchen. But there's something wrong, Eva is sitting at the head of the table and nobody listens to anything she has to say - she is completely ignored like a piece of furniture. The film spins rapidly to more strange things. Together the family appears to be somewhat normal or at least moderately functional. The minute each family member is outside the home, they become marginal and dysfunctional. That they treat their daughter or sister like a non-entity is strange. When Veit, the German exchange student, arrives, the family is turned completely upside down.I can't say that I loved this film, but yet there was something going on that drove me to the end and enjoy it. The cringe worthy moments had to do with boys watching porn and masturbating, another spreading sperm on his face, and the moment of the deflowering. Those were moments that made me squirm watching this film. And yet, I couldn't stop watching the film. Yes, it is without question a strange film.In the US this would be a film for adults. There is a lot of pot smoking, alcohol drinking, implied sex, some violence, a lot of strong language, and a young girl has simulated sex on camera. Oddly, the only nudity in the film happens to be a tiny view of a computer screen playing porn in the distance. Elsewhere this film is rated 12 in the Netherlands (Not recommended for children younger than 12 years), Canada 14A (children under 14 must be accompanied by an adult), and Sweden 11 (OK for children 11 years and older).I figured out why I liked this film. The two short subjects included on the DVD are essentially silent films by the director Michel ten Torn. They gave some insight into what he was trying to do with Deflowering. The final revelation was an interview with the director. This is a funny man that has a strange way of looking at the world. All three short subjects are well worth watching.If you have a fairly broad sensibility, this is an enjoyable film. It isn't a happily ever after film. And yet it isn't bleak and depressing. Things just don't turn out the way I expected them to turn out. Real life is that way.I was provided a review copy.",4,Strange Look At Life,1385337600,"11 25, 2013",2013,2999,"['Deflowering', 'Eva', 'van', 'End', 'incredibly', 'strange', 'movie', 'nothing', 'what', 'expected', 'was', 'times', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'others', 'touching', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'middle', 'ground', 'film.From', 'cover', 'art', 'description', 'expected', 'be', 'tender', 'quirky', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'young', 'girl', 'misunderstood', 'maybe', 'not', 'most', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'world', 'handsome', 'young', 'man', 'inner', 'beauty', 'falls', 'love', 'go', 'off', 'sunset', 'together', 'ended', 'up', 'blending', 'Danny', 'Deckchair', 'Smiley', 'Face', 'together', 'get', 'film', 'Yeah', 'what', 'thought', 'film', 'far', 'sweet', 'story', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine.This', 'film', 'strange', 'study', 'human', 'nature', 'film', 'what', 'normal', 'Dutch', 'family', 'breakfast', 'lot', 'conversation', 'stark', 'cool', 'kitchen', 'something', 'wrong', 'Eva', 'sitting', 'head', 'table', 'nobody', 'listens', 'anything', 'say', 'completely', 'ignored', 'piece', 'furniture', 'film', 'rapidly', 'more', 'strange', 'things', 'Together', 'family', 'be', 'somewhat', 'normal', 'least', 'moderately', 'functional', 'minute', 'family', 'member', 'home', 'become', 'marginal', 'dysfunctional', 'treat', 'daughter', 'sister', 'non-entity', 'strange', 'When', 'Veit', 'German', 'exchange', 'student', 'family', 'turned', 'completely', 'upside', 'down.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'loved', 'film', 'yet', 'was', 'something', 'going', 'drove', 'end', 'enjoy', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'moments', 'had', 'do', 'boys', 'watching', 'porn', 'masturbating', 'spreading', 'sperm', 'face', 'moment', 'deflowering', 'were', 'moments', 'made', 'squirm', 'watching', 'film', 'yet', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'film', 'Yes', 'question', 'strange', 'film.In', 'US', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'adults', 'lot', 'pot', 'smoking', 'alcohol', 'drinking', 'implied', 'sex', 'violence', 'lot', 'strong', 'language', 'young', 'girl', 'simulated', 'sex', 'camera', 'Oddly', 'only', 'nudity', 'film', 'be', 'tiny', 'view', 'computer', 'screen', 'playing', 'porn', 'distance', 'Elsewhere', 'film', 'rated', '12', 'Netherlands', 'Not', 'recommended', 'children', 'younger', '12', 'years', 'Canada', '14A', 'children', '14', 'must', 'be', 'accompanied', 'adult', 'Sweden', '11', 'OK', 'children', '11', 'years', 'older', '.I', 'figured', 'out', 'why', 'liked', 'film', 'two', 'short', 'subjects', 'included', 'DVD', 'are', 'essentially', 'silent', 'films', 'director', 'Michel', 'Torn', 'gave', 'insight', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'Deflowering', 'final', 'revelation', 'was', 'interview', 'director', 'funny', 'man', 'strange', 'way', 'looking', 'world', 'three', 'short', 'subjects', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'watching.If', 'have', 'fairly', 'broad', 'sensibility', 'enjoyable', 'film', ""n't"", 'happily', 'ever', 'film', 'yet', ""n't"", 'bleak', 'depressing', 'Things', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'way', 'expected', 'turn', 'out', 'Real', 'life', 'way.I', 'was', 'provided', 'review', 'copy']",The Deflowering of Eva van End
1646820,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00CFNM274,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[2, 2]","It isn&#8217;t as if there is any blight of good films involving the transition from adolescence into young adulthood in the marketplace; but, for my tastes, I find it refreshing as of late to find so many of them coming from the foreign markets.  Well, for too long the American teenage experience &#8211; I&#8217;m not putting it down, as I lived through my very own &#8211; has dominated the films about this awkward time in everyone&#8217;s life; if nothing else, I find it reassuring to know that our foreign brother and sisters struggle with much of the same emotional highs and lows because it unites us culturally.  It brings us closer together.  It once more reminds us that we share more in common than we truly differ from one another, and having that seminal &#8216;common ground&#8217; from which to begin any dialogue is refreshing.THE DEFLOWERING OF EVA VAN END amps it up another notch.  While presenting the struggles of the young, it also explores those of the young-at-heart &#8211; the parents, who all too often get overlooked in their development with the family because (let&#8217;s face it) their challenges tend to be less inviting, less inspiring, and decidedly less glamorous.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Veit (played with cleverly nuanced awareness and equal detachment by a sparkly Rafael Gariesen) is a German foreign exchange student who comes to live with a Dutch family, all for the purpose of learning better English.  Eva (Vivian Dierickx in a breakout performance) is the young girl who serves as his sponsor, and she&#8217;s immediately smitten with his charms, looks, and attitude.  Much to her confusion, Veit manages to equally affect the various members of her family, accidentally forcing them to tear down the barriers of their ordered existence only to find something much different hiding beneath.As the title suggests, his DEFLOWERING is all about transition.  Yet rather than be an individual experience this one ends up being far more orgiastic in nature.  Everyone is affected by Veit, even those truly not vying for his attention.  The boys at school want to be just like him, and the girls can&#8217;t take their eyes of him.  Back at home, father Evert (Ton Kas) recognizes there are souls beyond the homefront who might be needing whatever he can give while mother Etty (a frumpily luminous Jacqueline Blom) discovers a deficiency in her ability to find personal peace.  As for the brothers?  Erwin (Tomer Pawlicki) suddenly uncovers a repressed homosexuality, and Manuel (Abe Dijkman) finds himself obsessed with attaining &#8216;trophies&#8217; from all his exploits, carnal or otherwise.Anne Barnhoorn&#8217;s smart script uses Veit as a mirror: he&#8217;s held up over each of these various characters, and only under his influence can each of them see what they&#8217;re missing &#8211; a father without a child to raise, a mother struggling with identity, and so on and so forth.  Eva&#8217;s shortcomings, however, end up getting scant attention texturally &#8211; in spite of having her name in the title! &#8211; but that&#8217;s largely because her struggle is the easiest identified, even from the outset.  In early scenes, she&#8217;s shown sitting at the dinner table; life is going on all around her &#8211; mom, dad, and the boys are carrying a variety of mixed conversations with one another; and yet no one gives her a second look or listens to what she says.  At school, she can only draw the attention of the equally outcast members of pubescent society.  She slumps her shoulders; she wears t-shirts adorned with curiously obtuse designs; and she doesn&#8217;t even try to fit in any longer.  Director Ten Horn stages it all brilliantly, and he captures it with some dazzling camera trickery that&#8217;ll no doubt inspire those who marvel in all the details.  And, also as the title promises, she gets her deflowering.What does it get her?Her changes aren&#8217;t nearly as drastic as those of her family, and perhaps that&#8217;s precisely the message implied through all of this.  Everyone is transformed in some way, big or small, by Veit&#8217;s powers over them.  Eva&#8217;s afforded a universe of personal knowledge &#8211; symbolized by the glow-in-the-dark ceiling star that lands on her forehead the moment her German suitor climaxes &#8211; while the rest of her blood relations are left to sort through the open baggage of their psychological comeuppances &#8230; good or bad.  For the most part, they&#8217;re good, but when you hear Manuel &#8211; now properly named &#8216;Emanual&#8217; &#8211; promise that things will go back to normal once Veit is gone, you&#8217;ll know like I did that the order of things has changed.THE DEFLOWERING OF EVA VAN END (2012) is the feature-length debut from Michiel Ten Horn.  The film is produced by Pupkin Film.  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled by Film Movement as part of its &#8216;Film of the Month&#8217; Club.  For those needing it spelled out perfectly, this is a Dutch-spoken language release (with a smattering of German) with English subtitles (there is no English dubbing track, but there&#8217;s a significant portion of the picture that is spoken in English).  As for the technical specifications, the film looks and sounds impressive consistently with some smart cinematography thrown in for good measure.  If it&#8217;s special features you&#8217;re interested in, there&#8217;s a clever director interview (5 minutes), along with the requisite character/actor biographies, and two additional short films (&#8220;Basta&#8221; and &#8220;Arie&#8221;) also from Ten Horn for your entertainment.  A nice package, indeed.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Much like anyone&#8217;s first deflowering, THE DEFLOWERING OF EVA VAN END ain&#8217;t perfect, but it&#8217;s still a delightfully dark and wryly comic mix of what happens when the socially imperfect collide head on with the socially perfect.  The performances are terrific &#8211; in particular, Vivian Dierickx captures the general cluelessness and cultural awkwardness of being still trapped with a young mind in a body starting to change (from impulses as well as family or peer pressures) &#8211; and the script, while lacking in depth, makes up for it in a myriad of smaller moments that gives balance to one of the smartest ensembles I&#8217;ve seen in quite some time.  Be warned: it has a psychologically dark moment that might disturb some viewers (involving a member of the Animal Kingdom), but once the shock wears off it&#8217;ll all make more sense.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Film Movement provided me with a DVD copy of THE DEFLOWERING OF EVA VAN END by request for the expressed purposes of

1646821,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00CFNM274,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","A refreshingly humorous, insightful and sensitive film from the Netherlands from director Michael ten Horn who also wrote this contemporary story with Anne Barn Hoorn lights up the screen with vivid color, funky music, a story with many twists and a groups of excellent actors. It is a film hat deserves a wide audience because it addresses issues usually avoided in honest filmmaking.The van End family is prototypically dysfunctional, having a tough time connecting to one another, leading their own little lives in their own silly little worlds. The father Evert (Ton Kas) works in a factory that makes a hotdog appearing food piece: once a year there is an eating contest and for the past few years his son Manuel (Abe Dijkman) has won the trophy for eating the most (otherwise Manuel is a trouble maker who spends his hours smoking dope). The mother Etty (Jacqueline Blom) is discontent with the family in general and feeling ignored by her husband who is caught up in preparing their 25th wedding anniversary party. The oldest son Erwin (Tomer Pawlicki) has severe facial acne but is obsessed with an upcoming marriage to an Indian girl Mardou (Anandi Gall), selecting paint colors and other distractions to avoid intimate contact with his fianc&eacute;. That leaves the only daughter, Eva (Vivian Dierickx), an overweight unpopular misfit whose best friend is her bunny rabbit and who announces to her family (though they ignore her) that she is participating in a school project to bring German exchange students to learn English by living with Dutch families. The German lad Veit (handsome and talented 19 year old Rafael Gareisen) arrives and is polite, thoughtful, caring, gentle, organized, spiritually centered, who also loves to party and be a proper houseguest. The film&#8217;s story is how Veit changes everyone in this family: introducing Evert to his little African friend Ngiri (Nicanor Zinga) over Skype and Evert elects to help the poverty striken lad by sending money; introducing Etty to meditation that allows Etty to loses her pent up anger and sadness; Introducing Erwin to his sexuality (very subtly); and equally subtly deflowering the ugly chubby pathetic and very needy Eva. The result of Veit&#8217;s 2 week stay dramatically changes this family, outing secrets that have been hurtful and making them care for each other in a normal and healthy, loving fashion.It all comes together with many more sidebars of action that emphasize the fragility of each of the characters. Yes, it has humorous moments, but the overall message is a tender one and is very ell presented. In Dutch and English with subtitles.

1646822,A2TUA4VWCMNXI,B00CFNM274,John D. Cofield,"[1, 2]","This Dutch film with English subtitles is another fine release from Film Movement.  Eva Van End is a 15 year old high school student struggling with all the typical problems of adolescence, plus the additional one of being the youngest and most ignored member of a severely dysfunctional family.  When she tries to tell her parents and brothers at dinner one night that she is going to be bringing a German exchange student home for a two week visit, no one even listens to her.When Veit, the German exchange student, arrives everything turns upside down for Eva and her family.  He is tall and handsome, intelligent, and extremely nice.  Eva's family is shocked by his arrival, but begrudgingly make room for him.  Veit's good looks and charisma make him a magnet for the popular girls at school, who heretofore have ignored Eva, arouse jealousy in her two older brothers, and completely bemuse her distracted parents.  It's hard to say at first how Eva herself feels about Veit, because she's normally glum and silent, but by the end of the film it's become very clear that he has awakened something in her as well. What happens is fairly predictable, but with so many unexpected little twists and turns that it's enjoyable to watch.This is a humorous film with some very dark underpinnings, in the typical fashion of so many teenage angst movies.  The ending is somewhat equivocal, and we are left uncertain as to how long lasting some of the changes Veit has produced will be, but there is no doubt that Eva herself has been profoundly affected by him.",5,Both Literal And Metaphorical,1384473600,"11 15, 2013",2013,1556,"['Dutch', 'film', 'English', 'subtitles', 'fine', 'release', 'Film', 'Movement', 'Eva', 'Van', 'End', '15', 'year', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'struggling', 'typical', 'problems', 'adolescence', 'additional', 'one', 'being', 'youngest', 'most', 'ignored', 'member', 'severely', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'When', 'tell', 'parents', 'brothers', 'dinner', 'one', 'night', 'going', 'be', 'bringing', 'German', 'exchange', 'student', 'home', 'two', 'week', 'visit', 'one', 'even', 'her.When', 'Veit', 'German', 'exchange', 'student', 'everything', 'turns', 'upside', 'down', 'Eva', 'family', 'tall', 'handsome', 'intelligent', 'extremely', 'nice', 'Eva', 'family', 'shocked', 'arrival', 'begrudgingly', 'make', 'room', 'Veit', 'good', 'looks', 'charisma', 'make', 'magnet', 'popular', 'girls', 'school', 'who', 'heretofore', 'have', 'ignored', 'Eva', 'arouse', 'jealousy', 'two', 'older', 'brothers', 'completely', 'distracted', 'parents', 'hard', 'say', 'first', 'how', 'Eva', 'Veit', 'normally', 'glum', 'silent', 'end', 'film', 'become', 'very', 'clear', 'awakened', 'something', 'as', 'well', 'What', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'so', 'many', 'unexpected', 'little', 'twists', 'enjoyable', 'watch.This', 'humorous', 'film', 'very', 'dark', 'underpinnings', 'typical', 'fashion', 'so', 'many', 'teenage', 'angst', 'movies', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'equivocal', 'are', 'left', 'uncertain', 'how', 'long', 'lasting', 'changes', 'Veit', 'produced', 'will', 'be', 'doubt', 'Eva', 'been', 'profoundly', 'affected']",The Deflowering of Eva van End

She is a wallflower and doesn't seem to have a voice of her own but she watches everything. Her family continues their awkward lives around her and already has issues before the story even begins. And then Viet shows up -- an exchange student from Germany. His good looks, confidence and charm, put everyone around him in a tailspin. Mom is learning to meditate, Dad is sending money to a soda sipping, 'needy' child in Africa, their oldest son is obsessed with getting rid of his acne, their other son busy getting high. And Eva watches it all go by, waiting for the moment that Viet shows her some attention.The Deflowering of Eva van End is funny, introspective and dysfunctional.

1646824,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00CFNM274,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","The title of this 2013 Danish film combined with our introduction to the title character is pretty much guaranteed to result in a raised eyebrow or too.  Eva van End is fifteen-years-old and the thought that the lost of her virginity qualifies as a subject of some sort of humor is definitely disconcerting.  But the moment promised by the time comes in the final act and by then the viewer is well acclimated to the idea that this is an act to be taken symbolically and as the punch line for something other than a crude joke.The family van End is, to say the least, dysfunctional in the extreme.  Tolstoy's dictum about every unhappy family being unhappy it is own way could certainly have a corollary specific to dysfunctional families.  Etty (Jacqueline Blom), the mother, is either yelling at her youngest son,Manuel (Abe Dijkman), for being a dope fiend, or heaping praise upon her oldest son, Erwin (Tomer Pawlicki), who is looking forward to getting married (and away from his mother, one would think).  Evert (Ton Kas), the milquetoast father, has plenty to say (or write on memos), but no one pays attention to any of his suggestions.  Stuck at the end of the family pecking order is Eva (Vivian Dierickx), who seldom says a word, and when she does, nobody pays attention.  Not even when she informs the family at dinner one night that a German exchange student is coming to live with them for a while.  You might be inclined to equate Germany with Nazis and Hitler--certainly Eva does in her presentation on the country to her classmates--but in terms of continental Europe the Germany economic machine is admired and when Veit (Rafael Gareisen) arrives, looking like a young Aryan god, he and his culture seem to represent all that is good about the present, with nary a look at all that unpleasantness in the past.Viet is only staying with the van End family for two weeks, but in that fortnight their interactions with the visitor sparks each in turn out of their lethargy.  Certainly when they look at Viet they can see nothing of themselves and it becomes clear that they find themselves wanting after making such comparisons.  We sense that Viet's apparent perfection is too good to be true, mainly because we want the character to be more than a Mary Poppins-like figure that comes in and saves the children, saves the father, saves everybody and goes his merry way.  I do not think I would go so far as to see this film as a parable regarding Germany hegemony, but the evidence for such a critique is certainly there on screen.Ultimately, &#34;The Deflowering of Eva van End&#34; has to be taken as satire rather than as a tragicomedy, and for me it was impossible not to see director Michiel ten Horn as a kindred spirit to Wes Anderson, although certainly not as creatively audacious.  Our assumption is that the family van End will be better off from having known Viet, even if it means their old way of life is burned to the ground, because, let's face it, they have nowhere to go but up.  But when the credits role, you will have to ask yourself if you truly believe that to be the case.",4,A satire in which a deftly dysfunctional Dutch family is changed forever by a German exchange student,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,3111,"['title', '2013', 'Danish', 'film', 'combined', 'introduction', 'title', 'character', 'pretty', 'much', 'guaranteed', 'result', 'raised', 'eyebrow', 'too', 'Eva', 'van', 'End', 'fifteen-years-old', 'thought', 'lost', 'virginity', 'qualifies', 'subject', 'sort', 'humor', 'definitely', 'disconcerting', 'moment', 'promised', 'time', 'final', 'act', 'then', 'viewer', 'well', 'acclimated', 'idea', 'act', 'be', 'taken', 'symbolically', 'punch', 'line', 'something', 'other', 'crude', 'joke.The', 'family', 'van', 'End', 'say', 'least', 'dysfunctional', 'extreme', 'Tolstoy', 'dictum', 'unhappy', 'family', 'being', 'unhappy', 'own', 'way', 'could', 'certainly', 'have', 'corollary', 'specific', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'Etty', 'Jacqueline', 'Blom', 'mother', 'either', 'yelling', 'youngest', 'son', 'Manuel', 'Abe', 'Dijkman', 'being', 'dope', 'fiend', 'heaping', 'praise', 'oldest', 'son', 'Erwin', 'Tomer', 'Pawlicki', 'who', 'looking', 'forward', 'getting', 'married', 'away', 'mother', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'Evert', 'Ton', 'Kas', 'milquetoast', 'father', 'plenty', 'say', 'write', 'memos', 'one', 'attention', 'suggestions', 'Stuck', 'end', 'family', 'pecking', 'order', 'Eva', 'Vivian', 'Dierickx', 'who', 'seldom', 'word', 'when', 'nobody', 'attention', 'Not', 'even', 'when', 'family', 'dinner', 'one', 'night', 'German', 'exchange', 'student', 'coming', 'live', 'while', 'might', 'be', 'inclined', 'equate', 'Germany', 'Nazis', 'Hitler', 'certainly', 'Eva', 'presentation', 'country', 'classmates', 'terms', 'continental', 'Europe', 'Germany', 'economic', 'machine', 'admired', 'when', 'Veit', 'Rafael', 'Gareisen', 'looking', 'young', 'Aryan', 'god', 'culture', 'seem', 'represent', 'good', 'present', 'look', 'unpleasantness', 'past.Viet', 'only', 'staying', 'van', 'End', 'family', 'two', 'weeks', 'fortnight', 'interactions', 'visitor', 'turn', 'lethargy', 'Certainly', 'when', 'look', 'Viet', 'can', 'see', 'nothing', 'clear', 'find', 'wanting', 'making', 'such', 'comparisons', 'sense', 'Viet', 'apparent', 'perfection', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'mainly', 'want', 'character', 'be', 'more', 'Mary', 'Poppins-like', 'figure', 'children', 'father', 'everybody', 'merry', 'way', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'see', 'film', 'parable', 'regarding', 'Germany', 'hegemony', 'evidence', 'critique', 'certainly', 'there', 'screen.Ultimately', '34', 'Deflowering', 'Eva', 'van', 'End', '34', 'be', 'taken', 'satire', 'rather', 'tragicomedy', 'was', 'impossible', 'not', 'see', 'director', 'Michiel', 'Horn', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'certainly', 'not', 'creatively', 'audacious', 'assumption', 'family', 'van', 'End', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'having', 'known', 'Viet', 'even', 'old', 'way', 'life', 'burned', 'ground', 'let', 'face', 'have', 'nowhere', 'go', 'up', 'when', 'credits', 'role', 'will', 'have', 'ask', 'truly', 'believe', 'be', 'case']",The Deflowering of Eva van End
1646825,A2EMIIHBL60K7L,B00CFNM274,Luanne Ollivier,"[2, 2]","The seventh entry in the Film on Friday series is The Deflowering of Evan Van End . This is the feature film debut of Dutch Director Michel ten Horn.The Deflowering of Eva Van Endwas an official selection for over ten film festivals.Eva quietly announces at the family dinner table that a German exchange student will be staying with them for two weeks. No one listens to or hears what Eva has to say. Her father is oblivious, her mother preoccupied and her older brother is focused on his own life. Her other brother is unfocused - stoned most of the time.The first few scenes were both funny and poignant. The family situation is not that unbelievable. I felt incredibly sad for Eva - brilliantly played by Vivian Dierickx. She's awkward, overweight, ostracised at school and ignored at home.When Veit (Rafael Gareisen) arrives, he is a blond god, seemingly good at everything and anything and uncannily able to target what each family member seems to need.But, although this film has been described as a dark comedy and the cover art seems to support that view, I found that it took a more serious tone than I initially imagined it would.Veit is the catalyst that triggers upheaval and great change within this dysfunctional family. Secrets are revealed, scabs are picked off and change is inevitable. All for the good? Well, I think each viewer would have a different answer. As the film ended, I wondered about Eva's place in her family - things have changed, but it is still not spelled out. But the last group shot is telling.  ten Horn also uses a 'falling star' metaphor to great effect.After the film, while reading the liner notes, I discovered that the idea for this film sprang from ten Horn's own experience with a German exchange student. Makes me wonder which bits are truth.One of the addition short films included is Basta - ten Horn's film thesis, that specialized in animation. The Deflowering of Eva Van End also has a bit of an animation feel to it. There are many short shots that showcase what the director wants us to see, then quickly cuts away. As the film picks up speed in the last twenty minutes, the cutaways multiply. We know what is happening to each family member and are just waiting to see how those moments will come together and what it means for the Van End family.The Deflowering of Eva Van End is a strangely moving, quirky film. Bits of it are squirmy, bits are sad, bits are affirming, but as a package it's very, very watchable. I quite enjoyed it.&#8226;Netherlands / 2012 / Dutch, English & German with English subtitles / 98 minAs mentioned, there are two short films included, both directed by ten Horn. I didn't enjoy Basta at all. Perhaps it was the style (slightly macabre Whoville tone with no real dialogue) or the material, but it was a miss for me. The second, Arie, was quite good.  A realistic view, rather than the animated style is more appealing to this viewer. And I liked the idea - an old man's pet bird dies, but with an unexpected ending)",4,Strangely moving and quirky,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",2013,3003,"['seventh', 'entry', 'Film', 'Friday', 'series', 'Deflowering', 'Evan', 'Van', 'End', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'Dutch', 'Director', 'Michel', 'ten', 'Horn.The', 'Deflowering', 'Eva', 'Van', 'Endwas', 'official', 'selection', 'ten', 'film', 'festivals.Eva', 'quietly', 'family', 'dinner', 'table', 'German', 'exchange', 'student', 'will', 'be', 'staying', 'two', 'weeks', 'one', 'hears', 'what', 'Eva', 'say', 'father', 'oblivious', 'mother', 'preoccupied', 'older', 'brother', 'focused', 'own', 'life', 'other', 'brother', 'unfocused', 'stoned', 'most', 'time.The', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'were', 'funny', 'poignant', 'family', 'situation', 'not', 'unbelievable', 'felt', 'incredibly', 'sad', 'Eva', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Vivian', 'Dierickx', 'awkward', 'overweight', 'ostracised', 'school', 'ignored', 'home.When', 'Veit', 'Rafael', 'Gareisen', 'blond', 'god', 'seemingly', 'good', 'everything', 'anything', 'uncannily', 'able', 'target', 'what', 'family', 'member', 'need.But', 'film', 'been', 'described', 'dark', 'comedy', 'cover', 'art', 'support', 'view', 'found', 'took', 'more', 'serious', 'tone', 'initially', 'imagined', 'would.Veit', 'catalyst', 'triggers', 'upheaval', 'great', 'change', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'Secrets', 'are', 'revealed', 'scabs', 'are', 'picked', 'change', 'inevitable', 'good', 'Well', 'think', 'viewer', 'would', 'have', 'different', 'answer', 'film', 'ended', 'wondered', 'Eva', 'place', 'family', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'still', 'not', 'spelled', 'out', 'last', 'group', 'shot', 'telling', 'ten', 'Horn', 'also', ""'falling"", 'star', 'metaphor', 'great', 'effect.After', 'film', 'reading', 'liner', 'notes', 'discovered', 'idea', 'film', 'sprang', 'ten', 'Horn', 'own', 'experience', 'German', 'exchange', 'student', 'Makes', 'wonder', 'bits', 'are', 'truth.One', 'addition', 'short', 'films', 'included', 'Basta', 'ten', 'Horn', 'film', 'thesis', 'specialized', 'animation', 'Deflowering', 'Eva', 'Van', 'End', 'also', 'bit', 'animation', 'feel', 'are', 'many', 'short', 'shots', 'showcase', 'what', 'director', 'see', 'then', 'quickly', 'cuts', 'away', 'film', 'up', 'speed', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'cutaways', 'multiply', 'know', 'what', 'happening', 'family', 'member', 'are', 'just', 'waiting', 'see', 'how', 'moments', 'will', 'come', 'together', 'what', 'Van', 'End', 'family.The', 'Deflowering', 'Eva', 'Van', 'End', 'strangely', 'moving', 'quirky', 'film', 'Bits', 'are', 'squirmy', 'bits', 'are', 'sad', 'bits', 'are', 'affirming', 'package', 'very', 'very', 'watchable', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'it.', '8226', 'Netherlands', '2012', '/', 'Dutch', 'English', 'German', 'English', 'subtitles', '/', '98', 'minAs', 'mentioned', 'are', 'two', 'short', 'films', 'included', 'directed', 'ten', 'Horn', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'Basta', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'style', 'slightly', 'Whoville', 'tone', 'real', 'dialogue', 'material', 'was', 'miss', 'second', 'Arie', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'realistic', 'view', 'rather', 'animated', 'style', 'more', 'appealing', 'viewer', 'liked', 'idea', 'old', 'man', 'pet', 'bird', 'dies', 'unexpected', 'ending']",The Deflowering of Eva van End

Eva's father is also lacking; searching for where he belongs in the world.  Exchange student Veit is not the typical teenager.  Being a charismatic, mature, older teenager he slowly wins over each family member, fearlessly guiding them on suggested missions, whether it be meditation, long distance donations to an African boy or relating to the two sons.  Poor Eva has a crush on Veit pushing her to the forefront of her family.  Dowdy, insecure but intelligent, Eva acts as the catalyst and gets transformed along with the rest of her bewildered family.The journey is more interesting than the ending, which does not disappoint, but at moments the film seems nearly surreal.  The cinematography is bright and unique, adding to the odd visual sense. Eva and Veit make for an interesting combination as well.  ""The Deflowering of Eva van End"" doesn't disappoint in its imagery or odd emotional results.Also included are two fascinating shorts.  ""Baste"" is a psychedelic, croppy, visually arresting film one would expect from David Lynch.  ""Aria"" concerns a frail older gentleman who loses his pet canary (Arie).  Soon after he meets another senior citizen and they embark on a whimsical and odd journey.

This is the July '13 release of the DVD-of-the-month Club (to which I subscribe). The movie will be available on Amazon as an Instant Video in early December.""The Deflowering of Eva van End"" (2013 release from the Netherlands; 98 min.) brings the story of the van End family, at first sight a seemingly 'normal' middle class Dutch family consisting of mom and dad, and their 2 sons Erwin and Manuel, and daughter, Eva, a very shy, introverted high schooler. As the movie opens, we see them having dinner, and Eva tries to tell them that a German exchange student is arriving soon for a 2 week stay, but she is ignored. When the German student arrives, a guy named Veit, the family is taken by surprise, but the parents readily accept Veit into their home. Veit is like a guy from another planet, almost too good and too nice to be true. Meanwhile we see the sons Erwin and Manuel experiencing serious problems, and it becomes pretty clear this is a very dysfunctional family. To tell you much more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see how it all plays out.Several comments: First, director Michiel Ter Horn, co-writing the script with Anne Barnhoorn, deserves a huge amount of credit for bringing this movie alive. His view and direction of this dysfunctional family, and how an outsider (the German exchange student) affects their lives, is impressive. In the liner notes, Ter Horn comments that this is based on his own family's experience hosting a German exchange student. Second, this movie has funny moments, which will make you chuckle, but to be clear: this is a bittersweet movie with serious undertones. Check out in particular the last 15-20 min. when all is revealed (and which blew me away). Third, kudos to the cast, none more so in my opinion than Eva (played by Vivian Dierickx in her screen debut), the awkward, sensitive teenager. And if you are wondering about the title of the movie: is it in the truest sense of the word, or is it more psychological? Just watch! In all, ""The Deflowering of Eva van End"" is another great addition to the Film Movement's rich (and on-going) library of foreign and indie movies.But wait! There is more! As usual, the DVD comes with extras, and this time we got not one (which is the usual case), but two shorties. They are both from director Ter Horn. First there is the 13 min. ""Basta"", but much better for me was the 10 min. ""Arie"" about a senior losing his pet canary Arie, with unexpected results.

1646828,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B00CFNM274,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[2, 2]","Eva is the only girl in a family of boys and is a one of those girls who has yet to blossom and is hence shunned by the `it girls' at school, and seems to be universally ignored by her family - parents included. She announces that as part of their student exchange programme she will be having a German student staying for two weeks - but they don't bother listening.So Veit turns up without fanfare and immediately makes an impact. He is good looking with an angelic smile, a vegetarian, he does charity work in Africa and has already travelled widely at a young age - and he is a meditation specialist and ornithologist as well as having perfect English - its enough to make anyone sick - with envy. Well all the girls fancy him and Eva's brother Manual takes a righteous dislike to him as he is seen clearly as major competition.Well he weaves his charm and soon has the entire family questioning themselves and all start to reinvent their lives and like all rebirths it can only be painful. Eva meanwhile can't help her emotions and is falling deeply under his thrall.This is a wonderful film. I received a copy from Film Movement for review purposes and it is the best I have seen this year from them which is saying a lot as they have all been good to excellent. It is in Dutch, a bit of German and a lot of English and all with good subs where and if needed. This has a down to earth charm, satire and humour all wrapped up in a film that is directed (Michiel Ten Horn) and acted superbly - simply can not recommend highly enough and it also has two extra short films from the same director, so not only a fantastic main feature but two extras making this unmissable.",5,Brilliant Coming of age film from the Nederland's.,1385856000,"12 1, 2013",2013,1674,"['Eva', 'only', 'girl', 'family', 'boys', 'one', 'girls', 'who', 'yet', 'blossom', 'hence', 'shunned', 'girls', 'school', 'be', 'universally', 'ignored', 'family', 'parents', 'included', 'part', 'student', 'exchange', 'programme', 'will', 'be', 'having', 'German', 'student', 'staying', 'two', 'weeks', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'listening.So', 'Veit', 'up', 'fanfare', 'immediately', 'impact', 'good', 'looking', 'angelic', 'smile', 'vegetarian', 'charity', 'work', 'Africa', 'already', 'travelled', 'widely', 'young', 'age', 'meditation', 'specialist', 'ornithologist', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'perfect', 'English', 'enough', 'make', 'anyone', 'sick', 'envy', 'Well', 'girls', 'fancy', 'Eva', 'brother', 'Manual', 'righteous', 'dislike', 'seen', 'clearly', 'major', 'competition.Well', 'charm', 'soon', 'entire', 'family', 'questioning', 'start', 'reinvent', 'lives', 'rebirths', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'painful', 'Eva', 'meanwhile', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'emotions', 'falling', 'deeply', 'thrall.This', 'wonderful', 'film', 'received', 'copy', 'Film', 'Movement', 'review', 'purposes', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'saying', 'lot', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'excellent', 'Dutch', 'bit', 'German', 'lot', 'English', 'good', 'subs', 'where', 'needed', 'down', 'earth', 'charm', 'satire', 'humour', 'wrapped', 'up', 'film', 'directed', 'Michiel', 'Ten', 'Horn', 'acted', 'superbly', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'highly', 'enough', 'also', 'two', 'extra', 'short', 'films', 'same', 'director', 'not', 'only', 'fantastic', 'main', 'feature', 'two', 'extras', 'making', 'unmissable']",The Deflowering of Eva van End
