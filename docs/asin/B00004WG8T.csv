554940,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,B00004WG8T,David Anderson,"[9, 9]","""Love Letters"", starring Golden Globe nominee Jamie Lee Curtis, is an unforgettable love story.  It desplicts a young DJ (played by Curtis) who loses her mother to cancer.  After her mother's death, she finds some old love letters that contained material she least expected.  All were written by a man whom her mother had an affair with in the 1960's.  Suddenly, she meets a man with whom she almost instantly falls in love.  However, he's married.  This forbidden love story leads to a passionate, yet highly emotional film.While the plot is highly interesting, it often moves too slow.  Besides, it has some great scenes; yet, it has some unnecessary scenes.  The unnecessary storylines, which do not relate to the overall film theme, often distract from the main theme.  However, the romance and sex scenes are as enticing as they should be.  They give this film the added rapture that stays interesting.  The intensity places itself in areas that keep this film suspenseful.  Sometimes, those scenes were placed in the unnecessary ones.  Every interesting aspect contains its own spice that never fades through multiple viewings.The best aspect of ""Love Letters"" is Jamie Lee Curtis's performance.  Though all actors in this film perform well, she gives this film the added individual emotion thoughout.  She even gives the slow moving scenes the added glare.  After being hailed as a ""horror movie queen"", she proves that she's mastered the art of hardcore drama.""Love Letters"" will have mixed reactions, but it'll surely be remembered for a long time afterwards.  Every fan of Curtis should own this film.",3,The Fine Jamie Lee Curtis,1097971200,"10 17, 2004",2004,1611,"['Love', 'Letters', 'starring', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nominee', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'unforgettable', 'love', 'story', 'young', 'DJ', 'played', 'Curtis', 'who', 'mother', 'cancer', 'mother', 'death', 'old', 'love', 'letters', 'contained', 'material', 'least', 'expected', 'were', 'written', 'man', 'whom', 'mother', 'had', 'affair', '1960', 'Suddenly', 'man', 'whom', 'almost', 'instantly', 'love', 'However', 'married', 'forbidden', 'love', 'story', 'passionate', 'yet', 'highly', 'emotional', 'film.While', 'plot', 'highly', 'interesting', 'often', 'too', 'slow', 'great', 'scenes', 'yet', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'unnecessary', 'storylines', 'do', 'not', 'relate', 'overall', 'film', 'theme', 'often', 'distract', 'main', 'theme', 'However', 'romance', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'as', 'enticing', 'should', 'be', 'give', 'film', 'added', 'rapture', 'interesting', 'intensity', 'areas', 'keep', 'film', 'suspenseful', 'Sometimes', 'scenes', 'were', 'placed', 'unnecessary', 'ones', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'own', 'spice', 'never', 'multiple', 'viewings.The', 'best', 'aspect', 'Love', 'Letters', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'performance', 'actors', 'film', 'perform', 'well', 'film', 'added', 'individual', 'emotion', 'thoughout', 'even', 'slow', 'moving', 'added', 'glare', 'being', 'hailed', 'horror', 'movie', 'queen', 'mastered', 'art', 'hardcore', 'drama', 'Love', 'Letters', 'will', 'have', 'mixed', 'reactions', ""'ll"", 'surely', 'be', 'remembered', 'long', 'time', 'afterwards', 'fan', 'Curtis', 'should', 'own', 'film']",N/A

The relationship between daughter and father spins quickly out control when the father takes to drinking to ease his pain.The father becomes abusive when drunk. The daughter (Jamie) finds some relief of sorrow by going through her mother's things.Here lies a great supprise.A package of letters hidden away revealing that her mother had a lover.Some how this revelation stirs a hunger in the daughter to pursue a similiar course.Enter James Keach. A photographer of some renoun Jamie's character is not only familiar with him and his work but is quite excited that she might meet him. Meet him she does and an affair developes. James character is up front with her in stating that he had nothing to offer her and she accepts those terms in the beginning. But, as the affair continues she finds she needs more.She becomes irrational in her quest of love even allowing a great job opportunity to slip through her grasp.All hope is placed in this affair.Everything blows up in a scene outside of James character's house where his wife and child can see.The real redeeming quality of the movie comes in the end where a time of healing is presented when Jamie's character meets her mother's lover.This is only one of two movies that I know of where Jamie does a couple of nude scenes.There doesn't seem to be much care in the quality of the lighting while filming.
