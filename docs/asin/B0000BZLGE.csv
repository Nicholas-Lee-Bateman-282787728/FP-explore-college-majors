771686,A3USRUCHAOC3MT,B0000BZLGE,"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff""","[12, 13]","This is the testimony of Sue Thomas, the inspiration of Sue Thomas F.B.Eye which was on Pax.  It is the taping of a church service where Sue tells her story.  (She refers to herself by her last name because, as she mentions later in the testimony, she still struggles with the letter ""s"").  Don't expect any segments from the series to pop up -- this comes across, as I said, like a taped sermon.This was filmed in May of 2003, during the first season of the TV series.  It is ironic that Sue's FBI. career lasted only slightly longer than the series did. Thomas did make two cameos in the TV series (the final episodes of the first and third/final seasons), where she told the actress playing her she was an actress who always wanted to be an FBI agent, as well as one in the third from the last episode of Doc (the episode titled ""The Final Ride"").Allow me to put on my preacher's hat.  This talk is not really evangelistic.  There is no real call to come down the aisle or to turn from one's sins.  Thomas goes through this talk mentioning God was working on her all along.  I would recommend this more for a church meeting than for an evangelistic setting (unless the preacher wants to give the message).",5,An Inspiration To Break The Barriers in Your Own Life,1282435200,"08 22, 2010",2010,1208,"['testimony', 'Sue', 'Thomas', 'inspiration', 'Sue', 'Thomas', 'F.B.Eye', 'was', 'Pax', 'taping', 'church', 'service', 'where', 'Sue', 'story', 'herself', 'last', 'name', 'because', 'later', 'testimony', 'still', 'letter', 's', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'segments', 'series', 'pop', 'up', 'across', 'said', 'taped', 'sermon.This', 'was', 'filmed', 'May', '2003', 'first', 'season', 'TV', 'series', 'ironic', 'Sue', 'FBI', 'career', 'lasted', 'only', 'slightly', 'longer', 'series', 'did', 'Thomas', 'did', 'make', 'two', 'cameos', 'TV', 'series', 'final', 'episodes', 'first', 'third/final', 'seasons', 'where', 'told', 'actress', 'playing', 'was', 'actress', 'who', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'FBI', 'agent', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'third', 'last', 'episode', 'Doc', 'episode', 'titled', 'Final', 'Ride', '.Allow', 'put', 'preacher', 'hat', 'talk', 'not', 'really', 'evangelistic', 'real', 'call', 'come', 'down', 'aisle', 'turn', 'one', 'sins', 'Thomas', 'talk', 'mentioning', 'God', 'was', 'working', 'would', 'recommend', 'more', 'church', 'meeting', 'evangelistic', 'setting', 'preacher', 'give', 'message']",N/A
