The second  half of the film is an extended standoff in the nightclub between Jack and  his band of thieves and Domenic's henchman, during which the thieves  discover why Jack brought them all together for what amounts to a suicidal  mission.I hate to give more than general info as I do not like to ruin  the surprises for others. What I will tell you is that I found this film  very interesting and liked the pairing of the two worst to work together  and why. I also liked the reasons that the people were brought in on the  deal. Over all this movie had some very well written twists and turns that  make this movie more than just a B-movie.The cast was also well put  together, including, Eric Roberts, Tia Carrere, and Chris Rock.",4,A action movie with a twist,963360000,"07 12, 2000",2000,1020,"['crafty', 'nightclub', 'owner', 'Jack', 'together', 'group', 'small', 'time', 'hoods', 'teams', 'up', 'unusual', 'pairs', 'black', 'man', 'white', 'racist', 'Ivy', 'Leaguer', 'simpleton', 'set', 'multiple', 'heists', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'elaborate', 'double', 'cross', 'notorious', 'gangster', 'Domenic', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'extended', 'standoff', 'nightclub', 'Jack', 'band', 'thieves', 'Domenic', 'henchman', 'thieves', 'discover', 'why', 'Jack', 'brought', 'together', 'what', 'amounts', 'suicidal', 'mission.I', 'hate', 'give', 'more', 'general', 'info', 'do', 'not', 'ruin', 'surprises', 'others', 'What', 'will', 'tell', 'found', 'film', 'very', 'interesting', 'liked', 'pairing', 'two', 'worst', 'work', 'together', 'why', 'also', 'liked', 'reasons', 'people', 'were', 'brought', 'deal', 'movie', 'had', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'twists', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'just', 'B-movie.The', 'cast', 'was', 'also', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'including', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'Tia', 'Carrere', 'Chris', 'Rock']",Immortals

Of course it all goes bad, predictable but still fun and entertaining.  There's a lot of gunfire, explosions, tough-guys and a gal, and some humor thrown in.  It translates to a very good action-thriller. Academy Award nominee Eric Roberts, is as good as he was in Runway Train (he was nominated for an Academy Award for in 1985). At the end of this film you might be surprise who the real target is!  It's worth your time, however it is only available in limited quantities, you'll have to order it and wait.  But it's worth it.  By the way, Chris Rock is true to form and he'll make you laugh!

With a powerful cast do eight strangers plus Jack come to life, and through their struggle to survive their fate do they hold our heart in their hands. And the storyline is a sweet symphony that wastes no time sweeping us off our feet and stealing our breath away, and as the story spirals to its climax does it hold us spellbound, captivated by the bonds that form and the fight for life over death.

481196,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,6305858217,Richard Ross,"[3, 3]","This bit of wisdom is imparted by nightclub owner Nick (Eric Roberts) to the eight thieves he's assembled to pull off a dangerous heist. If you make it to the end of this movie, you'll agree with him and want yours back. A great cast that includes Tia Carrere, Joe Pantoliano, Tony Curtis, William Forsythe, Clarence Williams and an annoying Chris Rock do the best they can to make it work but it's not enough. Nick plans on relieving an ""overseas investor"" of four suitcases containing $7 million. He pairs the crooks up in teams of two and since none of them like each other the robbery doesn't go off without a hitch. Two of the team are shot and one is gravely wounded. It's a lot like 'Reservoir Dogs' since one of the bad guys is shot in the stomach and spends the remainder of the film bleeding to death and the bleeding baddies return to the nightclub awaiting further instructions from their leader. The movie was written by Kevin Barnhardt who plays Billy in the film. He's a better actor than writer and not surprisingly he gives himself some of the best lines. Tony Curtis is the most fun as a Mafioso who suspects Nick is up to something and who storms the nightclub with a couple of his boys to straighten the young punk out. The Mexican standoff is hilarious thanks to Curtis and Roberts. The surprise twist explaining why the robbers were chosen was unexpected and works in the film's favor. If you're a fan of any of the actors you might get a chuckle out of this one but if you can take em or leave em than leave this film alone. For the two people who saw the Steven Seagal bomb squad masterpiece 'Ticker' you'll recognize a LOT of footage that's been stolen from that film and inserted in this one.",3,Time's The One Thing You Can't Get Back,1246838400,"07 6, 2009",2009,1718,"['bit', 'wisdom', 'imparted', 'nightclub', 'owner', 'Nick', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'eight', 'thieves', 'assembled', 'pull', 'off', 'dangerous', 'heist', 'make', 'end', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'want', 'yours', 'back', 'great', 'cast', 'Tia', 'Carrere', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'Clarence', 'Williams', 'annoying', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'make', 'work', 'not', 'enough', 'Nick', 'relieving', 'overseas', 'investor', 'four', 'suitcases', 'containing', '7', 'million', 'crooks', 'up', 'teams', 'two', 'none', 'other', 'robbery', ""n't"", 'go', 'off', 'hitch', 'Two', 'team', 'are', 'shot', 'one', 'gravely', 'wounded', 'lot', ""'Reservoir"", 'Dogs', 'one', 'bad', 'guys', 'shot', 'stomach', 'remainder', 'film', 'bleeding', 'death', 'bleeding', 'baddies', 'return', 'nightclub', 'awaiting', 'further', 'instructions', 'leader', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'Kevin', 'Barnhardt', 'who', 'Billy', 'film', 'better', 'actor', 'writer', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'best', 'lines', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'most', 'fun', 'Mafioso', 'who', 'Nick', 'up', 'something', 'who', 'storms', 'nightclub', 'couple', 'boys', 'straighten', 'young', 'punk', 'Mexican', 'standoff', 'hilarious', 'thanks', 'Curtis', 'Roberts', 'surprise', 'twist', 'explaining', 'why', 'robbers', 'were', 'chosen', 'was', 'unexpected', 'film', 'favor', ""'re"", 'fan', 'actors', 'might', 'get', 'chuckle', 'one', 'can', 'take', 'em', 'leave', 'em', 'leave', 'film', 'alone', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'bomb', 'squad', 'masterpiece', ""'Ticker"", ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'LOT', 'footage', 'been', 'stolen', 'film', 'inserted', 'one']",Immortals

The movie is about a bunch of criminals who convene by the order of a mastermind (Eric Roberts) to pull robberies across the city to test their mettle and competence for ripping off the head of a mafia crime family(Tony Curtis). The problem I had with this is that all the characters appear so stupid you wonder how they could be career criminals in the first place. Their zany stupidity takes away from the film for it to be a decent actioner. and as far as the comic aspect, it works to hard to be funny to be actually funny!! it provokes no reactions within you,this movie is stale,it doesn't keep your attention. As far as the performances are concerned they are uninspired you get the feeling that this was just a job for these actors.
