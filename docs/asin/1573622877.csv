189212,A3LNZKV31R04C4,1573622877,Betti Trapp,"[6, 7]","&quot;Casualties&quot; is the story of a battered woman, played by Caroline Goodall, who happens to be married to a cop. Thankfully, they have no children, because then it really would get ugly.  The abuse scenes are  graphic enough, and really make you feel for our heroine. Eventually she  meets another man of course, who promises to take care of everything for  her, with a twist.  The story is intense, but I think another actress would  have worked a lot better, like maybe Meryl Streep. Harmon's role is  performed beautifully, however, and the story is realistic enough to keep  you watching.  So, hands off the remote on this one folks, stay tuned.",4,Captivating and thrilling.,959472000,"05 28, 2000",2000,657,"['quot', 'Casualties', 'quot', 'story', 'battered', 'woman', 'played', 'Caroline', 'Goodall', 'who', 'be', 'married', 'cop', 'Thankfully', 'have', 'children', 'then', 'really', 'would', 'get', 'ugly', 'abuse', 'scenes', 'are', 'graphic', 'enough', 'really', 'make', 'feel', 'heroine', 'Eventually', 'man', 'course', 'who', 'take', 'care', 'everything', 'twist', 'story', 'intense', 'think', 'actress', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'lot', 'better', 'maybe', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Harmon', 'role', 'performed', 'beautifully', 'however', 'story', 'realistic', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'So', 'remote', 'one', 'folks', 'stay', 'tuned']",N/A

189214,A1KKMNDMDN85GN,1573622877,L. Holland,"[2, 2]","Wow - shades of the Deliberate Stranger here... Harmon can be incredibly charming and coldly evil.  His sinister side gave me chills.  The dynamics of abuse and manipulation are well presented - you want to shake the woman for putting up with it and get her to go for help.  Her denial and fear are palpable and depressingI was glad when one of the policemen who worked with her husband reached out to both of them encouraging them to get help.  Yet the failure of the social and legal system to make a significant difference when she reported the abuse confirms why so many people give up.  As the title of the movie states, there are many Casualties in abusive situations,There is a second agenda underscoring the abusive scenario - Harmon is not random in choosing to befriend this woman.  The viewer can sense he is as manipulative as the abusive husband -  his willingness to suggest criminal acts to free her from the marital relationship- the police cases of a trail of bodies that one detective recognizes as developing a pattern, and the final confrontation contribute to a finale that is thoroughly frightening and full of switches as to who will prevail.",5,Surprised at how sinister Mark Harmon could be,1389312000,"01 10, 2014",2014,1165,"['Wow', 'shades', 'Deliberate', 'Stranger', 'here', 'Harmon', 'can', 'be', 'incredibly', 'charming', 'coldly', 'evil', 'sinister', 'side', 'gave', 'chills', 'dynamics', 'abuse', 'manipulation', 'are', 'well', 'presented', 'want', 'shake', 'woman', 'putting', 'up', 'get', 'go', 'help', 'denial', 'fear', 'are', 'palpable', 'depressingI', 'was', 'glad', 'when', 'one', 'policemen', 'who', 'worked', 'husband', 'reached', 'out', 'encouraging', 'get', 'help', 'failure', 'social', 'legal', 'system', 'make', 'significant', 'difference', 'when', 'reported', 'abuse', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'give', 'up', 'title', 'movie', 'states', 'are', 'many', 'Casualties', 'abusive', 'situations', 'second', 'agenda', 'underscoring', 'abusive', 'scenario', 'Harmon', 'not', 'random', 'choosing', 'befriend', 'woman', 'viewer', 'can', 'sense', 'as', 'manipulative', 'abusive', 'husband', 'willingness', 'suggest', 'criminal', 'acts', 'free', 'marital', 'relationship-', 'police', 'cases', 'trail', 'bodies', 'one', 'detective', 'developing', 'pattern', 'final', 'confrontation', 'contribute', 'finale', 'thoroughly', 'frightening', 'full', 'switches', 'who', 'will', 'prevail']",N/A
