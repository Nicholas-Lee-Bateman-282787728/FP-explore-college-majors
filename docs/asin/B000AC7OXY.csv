925813,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000AC7OXY,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[10, 35]","Washington Irving's tale ""The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow"" continues to thrive and gets another new treatment. But after Irving's masterful tale, and Tim Burton's gorgeous and brilliant take on the story with his 1999 movie with Johnny Depp, what was left to do?. Well, after seeing this movie, you realize that there isn't anything left to do and this latest stab at the legend is near or at the bottom of the barrel. The Sleepy Hollow story and the Headless Horseman and all that has always been one of my top favorite stories and favorite Halloween time story. It's just wonderful. But this movie really makes a mockery of the whole thing. It's like this movie was trying to be an R rated film, but ended up feeling like a made for Hallmark movie trying to be a slasher film. I was hoping for another fun new look at the story, but this movie was just a big disappointment when I watched it when it first premiered on TV last Halloween. I know the version shown last Halloween was edited, but from the looks of things, it didn't seem like it needed much of it. I mean, how much of an R rated horror film could it of been when it was shown on The Fox Family Channel?!. There is nothing new here, and the filmmakers basically made a sloppy film that is nothing more than a bunch of cardboard kids getting slashed by a ridiculous looking Headless Horseman. What is the plot of the movie?. Well, there isn't a whole lot of it. Kevin Zegers stars as Ian Cranston(Ichabod Crane?), who learns that he is part of the Ichabod Crane family line. He and his family live in Sleepy Hollow, and Ian is the typical good kid who has the hots for the hot cheerleader(Kaley Cuoco) who is already taken, and is being pushed by his overbearing dad(Judge Reinhold). But thanks to a weird local(Stacey Keach), Ian finds out about his ancestry, and learns that the Headless Horseman has returned to take more heads. The end part of the movie takes place during the school's haunted hayride. That part was kind of cool, but as with everything else with this movie, it was not used to it's fullest potential. The whole Crane family line thing is okay, and I guess it makes sense in the modern world. But the script is so lazily and uneffectingly written, that it never makes a strong case. The characters are stereotypical cliches, and you don't care for a single one of them. Why would you?. Zegers is appealing as Ian, but it is Stacey Keach, with his hammy performance, that will end up being the only memorable one here. Backstreet Boy Nick Carter starts as Cuoco's jock/jerk/bully boyfriend. I would say that Carter should stick to singing, but I guess he shouldn't even do that. Carter's character isn't a character at all. He's just a walking, talking cliche of every high school jock/bully ever seen in a movie or TV show. I have always gotten the impression that Carter himself is kind of a hothead jerk in real life, but he can't even bring it to life on the screen. Plus, he looked horrible. Bad casting. Then there is Judge Reinhold. Don't get me wrong, I really like Judge. I always have. But he is so horribly misscast here. The father role is another cliche. He's the football coach at the high school who pushes and pushes Ian to do this and be like this and all that. The problem is that Judge has always seemed like a nice, soft kind of guy. This is a role and persona that does not fit him in any way, shape, or form. He has such a soft, whispery kind of voice, that when he gets mad and gives Ian all of his talks, it's more laughable than anything else. He can't do it. The Horseman himself is a complete joke. Why such the large pumpkin head?. Not only is that completely stupid looking, but he is dressed like some medievil jester. The whole appearance is incredibly foolish looking, and has no sense of fear or terror at all. The kills are silly and cartoonish, and none of the suspense scenes have any suspense in them. The whole movie is like a live action episode of Scooby Doo, minus the good parts. ""The Hollow"" is a hollow movie indeed. Bad acting, bad casting, and a script with no heart, depth, terror, or mystery. Just a vanilla teen flick. So, is there anything to like about it?. Not much. Besides the fun of Stacey Keach's hammy overacting and Kaley Cucoco in her cheerleading uniform(hubba hubba), there is nothing here to reccommend. This movie ends up being a major trick instead of a treat.",1,Sleepy And Hollow,1125446400,"08 31, 2005",2005,4404,"['Washington', 'Irving', 'tale', 'Legend', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'thrive', 'new', 'treatment', 'Irving', 'masterful', 'tale', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'gorgeous', 'brilliant', 'take', 'story', '1999', 'movie', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'what', 'was', 'left', 'do', 'Well', 'seeing', 'movie', 'realize', ""n't"", 'anything', 'left', 'do', 'latest', 'stab', 'legend', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'story', 'Headless', 'Horseman', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'top', 'favorite', 'stories', 'favorite', 'Halloween', 'time', 'story', 'just', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'really', 'mockery', 'whole', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'R', 'rated', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'feeling', 'made', 'Hallmark', 'movie', 'trying', 'be', 'slasher', 'film', 'was', 'hoping', 'fun', 'new', 'look', 'story', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'big', 'disappointment', 'when', 'watched', 'when', 'first', 'premiered', 'TV', 'last', 'Halloween', 'know', 'version', 'shown', 'last', 'Halloween', 'was', 'edited', 'looks', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'needed', 'much', 'mean', 'how', 'much', 'R', 'rated', 'horror', 'film', 'could', 'been', 'when', 'was', 'shown', 'Fox', 'Family', 'Channel', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'filmmakers', 'basically', 'made', 'sloppy', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'bunch', 'cardboard', 'kids', 'getting', 'slashed', 'ridiculous', 'looking', 'Headless', 'Horseman', 'What', 'plot', 'movie', 'Well', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'Ian', 'Cranston', 'Ichabod', 'Crane', 'who', 'part', 'Ichabod', 'Crane', 'family', 'line', 'family', 'live', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'Ian', 'typical', 'good', 'kid', 'who', 'hots', 'hot', 'cheerleader', 'Kaley', 'Cuoco', 'who', 'already', 'taken', 'being', 'pushed', 'overbearing', 'dad', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'thanks', 'weird', 'local', 'Stacey', 'Keach', 'Ian', 'out', 'ancestry', 'Headless', 'Horseman', 'returned', 'take', 'more', 'heads', 'end', 'part', 'movie', 'place', 'school', 'haunted', 'hayride', 'part', 'was', 'kind', 'cool', 'everything', 'else', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'used', 'fullest', 'potential', 'whole', 'Crane', 'family', 'line', 'thing', 'okay', 'guess', 'sense', 'modern', 'world', 'script', 'so', 'lazily', 'uneffectingly', 'written', 'never', 'strong', 'case', 'characters', 'are', 'stereotypical', 'cliches', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'single', 'one', 'Why', 'would', 'Zegers', 'appealing', 'Ian', 'Stacey', 'Keach', 'hammy', 'performance', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'only', 'memorable', 'one', 'here', 'Backstreet', 'Boy', 'Nick', 'Carter', 'Cuoco', 'jock/jerk/bully', 'boyfriend', 'would', 'say', 'Carter', 'should', 'stick', 'singing', 'guess', 'should', ""n't"", 'even', 'do', 'Carter', 'character', ""n't"", 'character', 'just', 'walking', 'talking', 'cliche', 'high', 'school', 'jock/bully', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'TV', 'show', 'have', 'always', 'gotten', 'impression', 'Carter', 'kind', 'hothead', 'jerk', 'real', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'bring', 'life', 'screen', 'looked', 'horrible', 'Bad', 'casting', 'Then', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'really', 'Judge', 'always', 'have', 'so', 'horribly', 'misscast', 'here', 'father', 'role', 'cliche', 'football', 'coach', 'high', 'school', 'who', 'Ian', 'do', 'be', 'problem', 'Judge', 'always', 'seemed', 'nice', 'soft', 'kind', 'guy', 'role', 'persona', 'not', 'fit', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'soft', 'whispery', 'kind', 'voice', 'when', 'mad', 'Ian', 'talks', 'more', 'laughable', 'anything', 'else', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'Horseman', 'complete', 'joke', 'Why', 'such', 'large', 'pumpkin', 'head', 'Not', 'only', 'completely', 'stupid', 'looking', 'dressed', 'medievil', 'jester', 'whole', 'appearance', 'incredibly', 'foolish', 'looking', 'sense', 'fear', 'terror', 'kills', 'are', 'silly', 'cartoonish', 'none', 'suspense', 'scenes', 'have', 'suspense', 'whole', 'movie', 'live', 'action', 'episode', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'good', 'parts', 'Hollow', 'hollow', 'movie', 'indeed', 'Bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'casting', 'script', 'heart', 'depth', 'terror', 'mystery', 'Just', 'vanilla', 'teen', 'flick', 'So', 'there', 'anything', 'like', 'Not', 'much', 'fun', 'Stacey', 'Keach', 'hammy', 'overacting', 'Kaley', 'Cucoco', 'cheerleading', 'uniform', 'hubba', 'hubba', 'nothing', 'here', 'reccommend', 'movie', 'up', 'being', 'major', 'trick', 'instead', 'treat']",The Hollow

A silly 'horror' film, this centers on Ian (Zegers), a descendant of Ichabod Crane and the return of the headless horseman to decapitate a Crane one way or another. Hey, it's Sleepy Hollow, New York, and I'll bet $50 dollars you didn't know this is a real town.It is odd that Stacy Keach would appear here, though he does an excellent job as usual as Claus Von Ripper, the town historian and nut-job. Though always a delight and by no means idle, Keach wastes a lot of his talent in my opinion. At least here he had good screen time.The undeniably gorgeous Kevin Zegers has gone on to slightly better roles, but he seems confused onscreen as well as off - he is a stunner and should be a major star by now. Somehow his highest achievement so far is he's the official cute gay poster boy. I do not know if Zegers is gay or not (I certainly think he is), but he is always a pleasure to watch.This film is heavier on the humor than the horror, which I prefer. It adds to the atmosphere and this film is actually a nice companion piece for Tim Burton'sSleepy Hollow.

925829,AHVG37KI3IM38,B000AC7OXY,G-Fan,"[0, 0]","- Please note that the review you are about to read is for the 2005 Halloween-themed updating of the Sleepy Hollow legend called simply, ""The Hollow"". It is NOT for the movie Hollow Man 2. For some reason only they might know, Amazon currently has the exact same set of mixed-up reviews posted for both movies. Please bear this in mind when reading my review of The Hollow. -The weeks leading up to Halloween are always my favorite time of year. The change of seasons, with the chill in the air. The candy and the decorations. And of course the plethora of scary movies with which we are inevitably inundated. I'm all the time looking for something new or a bit different for my ""holiday"" viewing enjoyment. The Hollow is a pleasantly diverting little movie that seems to somehow get lost in the ever-increasing torrent of horror and Halloween-themed movies that turn up every year as the month of October progresses. Most of the time, I like my horror a bit more intense than most of what unfolds here, but after several viewings over the past couple of Halloween seasons, the Hollow has gradually come to be one of my annual must-watch DVDs.It's a welcome (if highly implausible) updating of the classic Legend of Sleepy Hollow story, with young Kevin Zegers taking on the role of a teenaged descendant of Ichabod Crane, and the uber-cute Kaley Cuoco as his love interest. Stacy Keach is way over the top as the grizzled (and frequently inebriated) cemetery caretaker whose wild stories no one wants to believe. And Judge Reinhold shows up in a mostly thankless role as Kevin Zeigers' hard-nosed father. What could have been a typical teen hack & slash, has been toned down considerably, and except for a brief sex scene (with no real nudity), and a couple of semi-gory decapitations by the Headless Horseman, The Hollow could have easily been rated PG. In fact even with those aforementioned scenes, I'm surprised it earned an R rating rather than a PG-13. With just a few minor edits, I believe it was broadcast on ABC Family channel for several Halloweens in a row. Slightly more intense and graphic than an R.L Stein adaptation, but with a similar young adult feel to it, it delivers the goods without an over abundance of sex and violence.To be honest, The Hollow is nothing special, and not particularly inspired or original. The plot, once the movie gets going, is also pretty predictable. But it somehow puts me in just the right the mood for Halloween, with its creepy atmosphere and ghostly tale. Quite frankly, while there are a ton of far scarier horror movies out there that I truly enjoy (and some that I don't), not many of them hit all the right buttons when it comes to capturing the scary but fun (and somehow innocent) side of the holiday. The Hollow does a good job at doing just that.As I mentioned, the unedited DVD version is not really for the kiddies, and a preliminary viewing might be in order to determine if it's suitable for pre-teens. Though by today's standards, it's pretty tame, and even pre-teens would probably survive it without any permanent damage. Not really a four star movie - probably more like a three and a half. But since I'm feeling generous, along with the fact that Amazon doesn't recognize half stars, I'm rounding up to a four, at least for the moment. Not bad, and actually quite a lot of fun. You may want to give it a try next Halloween. It just might become one of your seasonal favorites too.",4,This Review Is For The Hollow (2005) - NOT Hollow Man 2,1351900800,"11 3, 2012",2012,3450,"['Please', 'note', 'review', 'are', 'read', '2005', 'Halloween-themed', 'updating', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'legend', 'called', 'simply', 'Hollow', 'NOT', 'movie', 'Hollow', 'Man', '2', 'reason', 'only', 'might', 'know', 'Amazon', 'currently', 'exact', 'same', 'set', 'mixed-up', 'reviews', 'posted', 'movies', 'Please', 'mind', 'when', 'reading', 'review', 'Hollow', '-The', 'weeks', 'leading', 'up', 'Halloween', 'are', 'always', 'favorite', 'time', 'year', 'change', 'seasons', 'chill', 'air', 'candy', 'decorations', 'course', 'plethora', 'scary', 'movies', 'are', 'inevitably', 'inundated', ""'m"", 'time', 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'bit', 'different', 'holiday', 'viewing', 'enjoyment', 'Hollow', 'pleasantly', 'diverting', 'little', 'movie', 'somehow', 'get', 'lost', 'ever-increasing', 'torrent', 'horror', 'Halloween-themed', 'movies', 'turn', 'up', 'year', 'month', 'October', 'progresses', 'Most', 'time', 'like', 'horror', 'bit', 'more', 'intense', 'most', 'what', 'here', 'several', 'viewings', 'past', 'couple', 'Halloween', 'seasons', 'Hollow', 'gradually', 'come', 'be', 'one', 'annual', 'must-watch', 'DVDs.It', 'welcome', 'highly', 'implausible', 'updating', 'classic', 'Legend', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'story', 'young', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'taking', 'role', 'teenaged', 'descendant', 'Ichabod', 'Crane', 'uber-cute', 'Kaley', 'Cuoco', 'love', 'interest', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'way', 'top', 'grizzled', 'frequently', 'inebriated', 'cemetery', 'caretaker', 'wild', 'one', 'believe', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'up', 'mostly', 'thankless', 'role', 'Kevin', 'Zeigers', 'hard-nosed', 'father', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'typical', 'teen', 'hack', 'slash', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'considerably', 'brief', 'sex', 'scene', 'real', 'nudity', 'couple', 'semi-gory', 'decapitations', 'Headless', 'Horseman', 'Hollow', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'rated', 'PG', 'fact', 'even', 'aforementioned', 'scenes', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'earned', 'R', 'rating', 'rather', 'PG-13', 'just', 'few', 'minor', 'edits', 'believe', 'was', 'broadcast', 'ABC', 'Family', 'channel', 'several', 'Halloweens', 'row', 'Slightly', 'more', 'intense', 'graphic', 'R.L', 'Stein', 'adaptation', 'similar', 'young', 'adult', 'feel', 'goods', 'abundance', 'sex', 'violence.To', 'be', 'honest', 'Hollow', 'nothing', 'special', 'not', 'particularly', 'inspired', 'original', 'plot', 'once', 'movie', 'going', 'also', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'somehow', 'just', 'right', 'mood', 'Halloween', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'ghostly', 'tale', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'are', 'ton', 'far', 'scarier', 'horror', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'not', 'many', 'hit', 'right', 'buttons', 'when', 'capturing', 'scary', 'fun', 'somehow', 'innocent', 'side', 'holiday', 'Hollow', 'good', 'job', 'doing', 'just', 'that.As', 'mentioned', 'unedited', 'DVD', 'version', 'not', 'really', 'kiddies', 'preliminary', 'viewing', 'might', 'be', 'order', 'determine', 'suitable', 'pre-teens', 'today', 'standards', 'pretty', 'tame', 'even', 'pre-teens', 'would', 'probably', 'survive', 'permanent', 'damage', 'Not', 'really', 'four', 'star', 'movie', 'probably', 'more', 'three', 'half', ""'m"", 'feeling', 'generous', 'fact', 'Amazon', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'half', 'stars', ""'m"", 'rounding', 'up', 'four', 'least', 'moment', 'Not', 'bad', 'actually', 'quite', 'lot', 'fun', 'may', 'want', 'give', 'try', 'next', 'Halloween', 'just', 'might', 'become', 'one', 'seasonal', 'favorites', 'too']",The Hollow
925830,AD9MPLYLMHKCC,B000AC7OXY,Ghoulie Guru,"[1, 2]","File this one under: Great concept, mediocre execution. The story is about Ian Cranston, a High School kid who carries the bloodline of Ichabod Crane. As soon as Ian moves into Sleepy Hollow, the Headless Horseman returns to life to finish the Cranes off once and for all. Kind of a neat little idea, and it could have been fun movie but the concept got lost somewhere along the line.It's hard to pinpoint what's wrong with the Hollow. For the most part, it's shot pretty well. There are some scenes that are really dark and grainy, but for the most part the movie looks better than most of these low budget horror flicks. I can't really fault the actors, even though Nick Carter is nobody's idea of a talented thespian and whoever thought casting Judge Reinhold as a football coach should be fired immediately. But the movie is carried pretty solidly by hottie Kevin Zegers and the girl from 8 Simple Rules. The real standout as far as acting goes is Stacey Keach, who really seems to be having a lot of fun with the role of the old grave keeper. I can't fault the writing, because while it's a little clich&eacute;d at times, there is a solid pacing to the story.I think the problem with this movie is that it doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up. Part horror movie and part after school special, it winds up feeling like an R.L. Stine Goosebumps episode with some nudity in it. The Hollow's biggest flaw is that it's uneven. The next biggest flaw is the way the Headless Horseman looks. He has a head, for one thing... and it's a completely ridiculous looking pumpkin head. As it is, the Hollow is worth a rental if you're a fan of the old Disney cartoon and are interested in seeing a modern day retelling of the story. I don't plan on adding it to my collection, but if you have kids that are like in their early teens, they might enjoy watching it on Halloween night.",3,"Not Entirely Hollow, But Not Solid",1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,1886,"['one', 'Great', 'concept', 'mediocre', 'execution', 'story', 'Ian', 'Cranston', 'High', 'School', 'kid', 'who', 'bloodline', 'Ichabod', 'Crane', 'As', 'soon', 'Ian', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'Headless', 'Horseman', 'life', 'finish', 'Cranes', 'off', 'once', 'Kind', 'neat', 'little', 'idea', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fun', 'movie', 'concept', 'got', 'lost', 'somewhere', 'line.It', 'hard', 'pinpoint', 'what', 'wrong', 'Hollow', 'most', 'part', 'shot', 'pretty', 'well', 'are', 'scenes', 'are', 'really', 'dark', 'grainy', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'better', 'most', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'flicks', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'fault', 'actors', 'even', 'Nick', 'Carter', 'nobody', 'idea', 'talented', 'thespian', 'thought', 'casting', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'football', 'coach', 'should', 'be', 'fired', 'immediately', 'movie', 'carried', 'pretty', 'solidly', 'hottie', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'girl', '8', 'Simple', 'Rules', 'real', 'standout', 'as', 'far', 'acting', 'Stacey', 'Keach', 'who', 'really', 'be', 'having', 'lot', 'fun', 'role', 'old', 'grave', 'keeper', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'writing', 'little', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'times', 'solid', 'pacing', 'story.I', 'think', 'problem', 'movie', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'be', 'when', 'up', 'Part', 'horror', 'movie', 'part', 'school', 'special', 'up', 'feeling', 'R.L', 'Stine', 'Goosebumps', 'episode', 'nudity', 'Hollow', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'uneven', 'next', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'way', 'Headless', 'Horseman', 'head', 'one', 'thing', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'looking', 'pumpkin', 'head', 'Hollow', 'rental', ""'re"", 'fan', 'old', 'Disney', 'cartoon', 'are', 'interested', 'seeing', 'modern', 'day', 'retelling', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'plan', 'adding', 'collection', 'have', 'kids', 'are', 'early', 'teens', 'might', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Halloween', 'night']",The Hollow

The main charcater  is told by a old gate keeper that he is a living decented of Icbob crane and the horse man had rise from the deaths of hell to hunt him down and kill him. He doesn't belive him but when two of his collge friends msyteriously dissapear he begins to fear that the horse men is not a legend the horseman is fact. Can he figure out the horseman's weakness and send him back to hall before every person in the town is decapated to the verge of oblivion. Find out in thrilling epic conclusion as the main character challanges the horse man to and old fasten mid evil duel right in the middle of sleepy hollow.

925834,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B000AC7OXY,Jonathan Appleseed,"[5, 14]","This movie works if one of the following four descriptions applies to you.1. You think Kevin Zegers is hot, you want to see anything he's in, and the swimming scene in Transamerica was the best thing to happen to you since you first had a peanut butter sandwich.2. You think Nick Carter is hot, and want to see if he can act. (He can't.)3. You like horror movies, no matter how bad they are, simply because it's a horror movie.4. For some reason unbeknownst to man you are interested in what Judge Reinhold is doing with his career.Within the first five minutes of the film I had it pegged as a Friday the 13th style movie. Within the first five minutes, it was. Then it expanded a bit, and we saw some interplay between father and son, and also some rather useless and pointless teenage romantic angst.In this rendition, the headless horseman actually had a head. It was a pumpkin. And it growled. There was also some serious fire that he was capable of - apparently - in the beginning. This fire was not with him when he needed it the most. And, of course, he used a sword to decapitate victimsLucky, then, that Kevin Zegers' character was on the fencing team (odd for such a small town to have a fencing team, don't you think?), and when he was able to get his hand on a sword at the very end - well - you get the picture.Judge Reinhold was a riot in the 80s. In this movie he was a football coach who talked about how things were when he played ball. I can't imagine a universe in which Reinhold played the kind of football he was talking to his players about. He would have died during his first game. He did, though, walk around the house with a football jersey on, and some silly pajama pants, so I guess that fit the role of a football coach. Still.All-in-all, I was certain that this review would be a one star review. Then it came out of the ""Jason woods"", and became marginally better.I was interested in the film for two reasons. First, I'm still waiting to see if Kevin Zegers can act. I have a feeling that he's going to break out of the horror mold he's in and become a lesser Jamie Lee Curtis. Unfortunately, in Transamerica they had him play a petulant teenager. They didn't give him room - i.e., they didn't write anything for him - that would have allowed him to express any range. Either that or he doesn't have any. Second, I do like horror films, even bad ones. Which this was. Just because I enjoy bad horror films doesn't make it a good movie. Which this wasn't.I was just about to post this review, then saw the three, four, and five star reviews. I'm sorry - what were you guys smoking when you watched this? Are you kidding me? As a bad horror film, this succeeds. But bad horror films don't get three, four, or five star reviews. It's insane.",2,Tim Burton and Johnny Depp will sleep well.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[6, 9]","Clutching desperately at the coattails of Washington Irving's classic tale, ""The Hollow"" is a modest horror flick that will keep you entertained, either with humor (intentional and unintentional) or a few decent scares.  I originally saw this flick on ABC Family about three years ago.  It has recently popped up on Sci-Fi channel.  It's a lot better than seventy-five percent of Sci-Fi channel's flicks, but does fit comfortably in that channel's Saturday movie lineup.  It's cast has a little something for everybody.  There's new stars for the younger crowd (Kevin Zegers, Kaley Cuoco), former 80's teen stars (Judge Reinhold), an old guy (Stacey Keach) and a former boy band superstar (Nick Carter).The story is centered around the return of Ichabod Crane's bloodline (Zegers) to the village of Sleepy Hollow.  When Halloween comes along, Zegers moves in on the high school football jock's girlfriend (Cuoco) and quickly makes an enemy out of said jock (Carter).  Teenagers go missing, and despite warnings from the cemetary keeper (Keach), the village goes on with it's Halloween Hayride, giving a returning Headless Horseman easy pickings.  Keach tries to convince Zegers that he's a descendant of Crane and that the Horseman has returned to finish a job he started many years ago.  Initially Zegers denies the possibility of being related to Crane.  As the story goes on, however, he begins to realize that he is Crane's descendant and only he can stop the Horseman from going on another killing spree.  Heads roll, there are plenty of near-misses, and Carter, Keach and Reinhold really chew up the scenery for the rest of the movie.When all is said and done, the viewer won't feel entirely cheated by this film.  Yes, it has some very bad moments in it, but those moments are what makes this film fun.  There are also a few legitimate scares throughout for the audience.  You won't be afraid to go roaming down deserted country roads at night after seeing this movie, but you will have a pretty good time seeing just how silly and spooky this film can be.  I'd consider it a rental, especially around Halloween, if you prefer your horror a little bit on the light side.

925836,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000AC7OXY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","In truth, I really didn't expect much from this modern tale derived from the legend of Ichabod Crane and Sleepy Hollow. But I like Kevin Zegers (and his thick mane of hair) and Kaley Cuoco (who has been in more than her share of less than stellar productions), so I thought I'd check out ""The Hollow."" There are certainly worse films on the market, but everything about ""The Hollow"" was so expected and so so uninspired. Were it not for Zegers' appeal and a very broad performance by Stacy Keach, I might even have tuned out of the movie. The gore factor is practically nil, the scare quotient is very low, and the plotting and resolution is standard at best. Lacking real fright--I'd hoped for some cheesy fun, bad movie mayhem, or any kind of humor to distinguish the story. Alas, it is all so ordinary--not a painful way to spend eighty minutes, but not much to recommend it either.Unbeknownst to him, Zegers plays a descendent of Ichabod Crane. His family has rather inexplicably and conveniently relocated to the sight of the original story of ""Sleepy Hollow,"" and he has become active in the Halloween festivals centered around the Headless Horseman. Packed with the requisite teenage drama--potential new girlfriend (Cuoco), her bully of a boyfriend (a bloated Nick Carter), a disapproving dad (Judge Reinhold)--Zegers must also contend with a murderous spirit. A delightfully over-the-top Keach plays the grave keeper/mentor/historian who is essential to keeping the rather tenuous plot alive. A couple of beheadings later and the crew is banded together for a final showdown. Again, it's all played rather straightforward and that's to the film's detriment because I really just wanted to laugh along and have a good ride.""The Hollows"" may well pass the time, but it's pretty conventional fodder served up in a non-threatening family fare sort of way. It's biggest fault may be that you've seen hundreds of movies just like it--many of them better. Still Zegers is likable, Carter is appropriately buffoonish, and Keach hails from a different movie altogether. Very slight, and not particularly fun, check it out as instant entertainment. You won't remember it in a month--but it'll do if you have nothing better going on for now.

I have a feeling in 10 or 15 years time, people will be laughing and enjoying the campiness of The Hollow, the same way people of my age group laughed at some of the lesser quality slasher movies of the 80's.",3,Not Bad for the Money,1281312000,"08 9, 2010",2010,1101,"['Once', 'again', 'have', 'movie', 'filmed', 'California', 'pass', 'off', 'taking', 'place', 'rural', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'such', 'movies', 'respect', 'Having', 'said', 'not', 'most', 'egregious', 'failing', 'flick', '.Trying', 'pass', 'Nick', 'Carter', 'off', 'high', 'school', 'quarterback', 'biggest', 'laugh', ""'ll"", 'have', 'movie', 'dorky', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'partner', 'Billy', 'Beverly', 'Hill', 'Cop', 'vey', 'close', 'second', 'who', 'tough', 'nail', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'coach', 'wonder', 'Nick', 'Carter', 'quarterback', 'Anyway', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'fair', 'attempt', 'doing', 'job', 'bet', 'really', 'paycheck', 'days', 'too.There', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'gore', 'compared', 'Friday', '13th', 'Halloween', 'nudity', 'sadly', 'lacking', 'really', 'thought', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'flick', 'money', 'have', 'feeling', '10', '15', 'years', 'time', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'laughing', 'enjoying', 'campiness', 'Hollow', 'same', 'way', 'people', 'age', 'group', 'laughed', 'lesser', 'quality', 'slasher', 'movies', '80']",The Hollow
925851,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000AC7OXY,trebe,"[1, 2]","An ABC Family TV Movie that draws on Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow as source material, The Hollow (2004) is a teen horror flick set in Sleepy Hollow, New York, that combines drama, humor, and horror, as the town's residents prepare for the coming of Halloween.In the village of Sleepy Hollow, Halloween is celebrated with old style public storytelling, and on the big night, a dramatic production that involves a ""ghostly hayride"" through historic areas of the village.  High schooler Ian Cranston (Kevin Zegers) is involved in oral storytelling, dramatizing Irving's legendary tale.  He catches the attention of Karen (Kaley Cuoco), a classmate on the cheerleading squad, which causes some friction with her kind of boyfriend Broady (Nick Carter).  Claus Van Ripper (Stacey Keach) is a strange old timer, who calls Ian ""teacher"", and babbles that the boy is a descendant of Ichabod Crane.For the Halloween production, Brody has the coveted role of the sword wielding headless horseman, but is upstaged by the appearance of another sword wielding rider with a jack-o-lantern for a head, who begins slashing off the noggins of unsuspecting victims.  With Van Ripper's assistance, Ian picks up an antique sword, and prepares to do battle with the flame headed apparition.Van Ripper has a key role, providing insight into what is happening, and also adding some comic elements.  Although sticking a jack-o-lantern head on top of the legendary ""headless horseman"", makes for a kind of cool looking figure, it is not consistent with the legend of Sleepy Hollow.  The traditional story does however, provide the basis for a very convenient resolution.Ex-Backstreet Boy Nick Carter, does pretty well riding a horse, while Kevin Zegers makes a suitable reluctant hero.  Kaley Cuoco (The Big Bang Theory) is perky and fun in a limited role.  The cast also includes Judge Reinhold, Nicholas Turturro, Natalia Nogulich, and a cameo by Eileen Brennan, but except for Stacey Keach as the grungy wild-eyed Van Ripper, most of the adult characters have minor roles.The film is too mild and goofy to satisfy the serious horror crowd, but with gore and violence occasionally pushing the limits of PG-13, The Hollow is probably best suited to teens, as it may be too intense for younger children.",3,Ichabod Crane's long lost relative challenges a jack-o-lantern headed demon . . .,1280361600,"07 29, 2010",2010,2296,"['ABC', 'Family', 'TV', 'Movie', 'Washington', 'Irving', 'Legend', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'source', 'material', 'Hollow', '2004', 'teen', 'horror', 'flick', 'set', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'New', 'York', 'combines', 'drama', 'humor', 'horror', 'town', 'residents', 'prepare', 'coming', 'Halloween.In', 'village', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'Halloween', 'celebrated', 'old', 'style', 'public', 'storytelling', 'big', 'night', 'dramatic', 'production', 'ghostly', 'hayride', 'historic', 'areas', 'village', 'High', 'schooler', 'Ian', 'Cranston', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'involved', 'oral', 'storytelling', 'dramatizing', 'Irving', 'legendary', 'tale', 'attention', 'Karen', 'Kaley', 'Cuoco', 'classmate', 'cheerleading', 'squad', 'friction', 'kind', 'boyfriend', 'Broady', 'Nick', 'Carter', 'Claus', 'Van', 'Ripper', 'Stacey', 'Keach', 'strange', 'old', 'timer', 'who', 'Ian', 'teacher', 'babbles', 'boy', 'descendant', 'Ichabod', 'Crane.For', 'Halloween', 'production', 'Brody', 'coveted', 'role', 'sword', 'wielding', 'headless', 'horseman', 'upstaged', 'appearance', 'sword', 'wielding', 'rider', 'jack-o-lantern', 'head', 'who', 'slashing', 'off', 'noggins', 'unsuspecting', 'victims', 'Van', 'Ripper', 'assistance', 'Ian', 'up', 'antique', 'sword', 'prepares', 'do', 'battle', 'flame', 'headed', 'apparition.Van', 'Ripper', 'key', 'role', 'providing', 'insight', 'what', 'happening', 'also', 'adding', 'comic', 'elements', 'sticking', 'jack-o-lantern', 'head', 'top', 'legendary', 'headless', 'horseman', 'kind', 'cool', 'looking', 'figure', 'not', 'consistent', 'legend', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'traditional', 'story', 'however', 'provide', 'basis', 'very', 'convenient', 'resolution.Ex-Backstreet', 'Boy', 'Nick', 'Carter', 'pretty', 'well', 'riding', 'horse', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'suitable', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'Kaley', 'Cuoco', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'perky', 'fun', 'limited', 'role', 'cast', 'also', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'Nicholas', 'Turturro', 'Natalia', 'Nogulich', 'cameo', 'Eileen', 'Brennan', 'Stacey', 'Keach', 'grungy', 'wild-eyed', 'Van', 'Ripper', 'most', 'adult', 'characters', 'have', 'minor', 'roles.The', 'film', 'too', 'mild', 'goofy', 'satisfy', 'serious', 'horror', 'crowd', 'gore', 'violence', 'occasionally', 'pushing', 'limits', 'PG-13', 'Hollow', 'probably', 'best', 'suited', 'teens', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'intense', 'younger', 'children']",The Hollow
