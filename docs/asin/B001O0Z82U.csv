I too consider it excellent in spite of occasional technical flaws (the camera work is a bit iffy--it does not pay to be influenced by a turkey like ""Moulin Rouge"").

It's worthwhile to notice that in spite of its critical success, it has met with outright rejection from the straight film world--Sundance, Tribecca etc.--because it is considered ""over the top"".

Set at the all-boys' school of Morgan Hill Academy,Timothy (Tanner Cohen) is smitten with fellow rugby player Jonathan. His drama teacher (Wendy Robie,fromTwin Peaks - The Definitive Gold Box Edition (The Complete Series)no less) inspires him to enter the senior play. Cast as the fairy Puck, she tells him to be enlightened,be awakened,take flight. As Puck, Timothy begins to take his role VERY seriously--and makes a love potion,for real.""Were the world mine"" accurately depicts the casual homophobia Timothy deals with on a daily basis. His mother is rejected because of her son's homosexuality,and it's heartbreaking. As Puck, Timothy turns people gay. The midwestern town where the story is set having mass gay weddings echoes Iowa's recent legalization of same-sex marriage. In the end, free will wins out. The straights return to being straight--and Jonathan turns out to really be as much in love with Timothy as he hoped. The townspeople have learned empathy and compassion.""Were the world mine"" is a glam rock opera,and it seamlessly blends fantasy with reality. It's surreal,dreamlike,and the musical numbers work.

1221475,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B001O0Z82U,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[8, 8]","Based (very) loosely on ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"", but actually adapted from writer/director Tom Gustafson's successful 2003 short film ""Fairies"", ""Were the World Mine"" is a full length gay musical, being compared as better than ""Hedwig ..."" and obviously more relatable.  It is essentially a fantasy about Timothy, a gay boy who auditions to play Puck in the play at his all-boy private high school, and - in researching the role - finds how to recreate Cupid's love potion, which allows him to have his crush, the school's rugby team star, fall in love with him instantly.  He spreads the ""love"" around by doling out the potion to others, often with unintended consequences.  His drama teacher, a rather weird egg who operates on a different plane than most of her fellow teachers, catches on to what happened, and tries to help.Word of caution:  If you catch only a few scenes from the film, don't judge it out of context.  There are exaggerated, stereotypical scenes of the rugby team (after the potion) doing ballet moves on the field, the (previously homophobic) burly coach professing his love to the male headmaster of the school, and seemingly ""instant"" same-sex couples kissing all over the place.  It's supposed to be a FANTASY, people, so saying ""That's not realistic"" is redundant!The cast is mostly unknowns with minimal credits, with the exception of Tanner Cohen as Timothy, who is noteworthy for a fine acting and singing performance, and Wendy Robie as the drama teacher, who ties the story together.  Filmed in and around Chicago, this is delightful, well-conceived entertainment that we seldom get targeting our community.  Winner of 17 awards at gay and indie film festivals, and well-deserved.  DVD (not rated but would be only a PG) includes director commentary and trailer.  There's also a soundtrack CD available.

1221482,A2IHIKHWCDB0FG,B001O0Z82U,Dexter Manning,"[20, 21]","The new film ""Were the World Mine"" can be categorized a number of different ways. Arthouse movie. Buddy picture. Fantasy. Feel-good picture. Gay flick. High school drama. Morality tale. Musical. Romantic comedy. Satire. Screwball comedy. Teen flick. Theatrical play. But, ultimately, it transcends easy categorization and is best enjoyed on its own terms with an open mind toward the unexpected.It takes as its inspiration William Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" but it also is highly influenced by growing up gay in small-town America. Our embattled protagonist, high-school student Timothy (Tanner Cohen, playing this eager teenaged soul with remarkable sincerity) is constantly ridiculed, rejected by his classmates, criticized by his mother, and leads an isolated existence merely because he's different from everyone else.He tries out for version of the Bard's play that his school is planning to stage and is cast in the role of Puck. It's an all-boy cast -- the way it would have been done in the time of Shakespeare, as the curiously open-minded theater teacher, Ms. Tebbit (Wendy Robie) points out. But that bears little improvement in Timothy's status as the school outcast. He is left to daydream comically but sadly about what it could be like to be loved, and by whom. And he's left with his comically insatiable crush on the school jock, Jonathon (Nathaniel David Becker).In the course of preparing for his role, our perpetually love-forsaken hero reads in the play about a strange potion that cajoles people to fall into the most swooning love imaginable. Timothy thinks: How wonderful it could be if I had such a potion, such a magic scent, to make anyone I desire fall in love with me. So, with an innocent deviousness, he follows the recipe so well detailed in the play and, voila, concocts a potion, which he discreetly keeps in a little, old-fashioned perfume bottle that he carries around wherever he goes, its spray tip topped by a flower with lavender petals.As a test, Timothy first sprays one of his friends who is visiting him in his bedroom, though share an interest in the other. The test passes, to Timothy's dismay; the friend becomes helplessly infatuated with Timothy and, throughout most of the film, he can't help but touch him. Timothy manages to escape his newfound admirer and, in the midst of the rehearsal sprays the object of his affection, Jonathon, instantly making him see Timothy in a whole new, irresistable light. And it doesn't stop there, a spray-happy Timothy eventually turns much of the town not just gay-friendly but just gay, including Coach Driskill (Christian Stolte), the biggest homophobe in the school. His mother's snobbish friend, who routinely snubbed gays, suddenly is overcome with an urgent need to have his mother in bed. His friend prefers Timothy's company over his own girlfriend's. The coach keeps trying to serenade the confounded (and married) school principal. What has happened to people? Confusion begins. Jealousy develops. Love reigns. Especially gay love.And, it's an exquisite kind of love, as the fantasy expands from a simple lavender liquid in a bottle to take over the entire filmscape with colorful, glittery costumes and sets, like a genie being let out of a bottle to fulfill a much-longed-for wish. The fantasy sequences, like a super-sweet sugar, gradually dissolve the boundaries that limit them to the movie's occasional, and rather catchy musical numbers (the soundtrack is by Jessica Fogle) and become more continually present. The visuals (shot by Kira Kelly with Cory James Krueckeberg's production design) are a sight to behold: quite theatrical, lavish and a bit gaudy, reminiscent of the French photographers Pierre et Gilles, and used to wonderful effect here (especially for a film with such a limited budget).The actors may appear a little too old to be playing teenagers, but their childlike exuberance and general goofiness help make up for that in this decidedly unusual and uninhibited movie directed by Tom Gustafson, who co-wrote the screenplay with Krueckeberg.But, what's really wonderful about this film is that it addresses a real issue with which millions of kids suffer in and out of school: the loneliness of not fitting in with anyone and the longing and trauma that go with it. And it has tremendous fun doing so, addressing the issue in a simple, off-kilter, little story, but not taking itself too seriously.

Although DVD menu opens attractively with a musical phrase from Mendelssohn's incidental music for the play, don't expect a disguised rerun of the play itself.Timothy is an isolated gay student at Morgan Hill Academy.  His best friends are straight students Max (Ricky Goldman) and Frankie (Zelda Williams).  Timothy would like to be with rugby star Jonathon (Nathaniel David Becker), who has a girlfriend Becky (Colleen Skemp).  When rugby players Cole (Brad Bukauskas) or Cooper (Parker Croft) give Timothy a bit of a bad time, Jonathon protects Timothy.  Although Jonathon seems willing to be friendly with Timothy, Timothy expects the worst and keeps slinking away.The drama teacher Ms. Tebbit (Wendy Robie) decides to put on ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" and recruits Timothy to audition.  Timothy's singing lands him the role of Puck.Timothy has a vision that lets him concoct a love potion that is squirted from a lavender pansy.  The recipient of the first, experimental squirt immediately falls in love with Timothy, who keeps his distance.  Timothy bikes to Frankie and asks, if she could make someone love her, would she?  She says of course she would.  This gives Timothy-Puck enough permission to try the potion on Jonathon at a rehearsal, followed by targeted doses to confound others.As love interests switch around, confusion and upset erupts between those who have received the love potion and those who have not.  Adults are included too.  The situation gets so far out of hand that the mayor declares that anyone can marry anyone else.Timothy gets long, languorous, romantic trysts with Jonathon.  All seems well, but Timothy knows there is a false element in the forced relationship, and Ms. Tebbit suggests it's time to set things right at the academy's climactic performance of  ""A Midsummer Night's Dream.""At the end not so much has changed, and yet all is different.  Timothy was the star of the show.  The recent events helped Timothy make some additional friends and has strengthened his relationship with Jonathon.  Timothy is not isolated any more.The concept is interesting, and it is fun to hear some of the familiar Shakespeare lines come through.  While some may quibble on the production values, I thought there was value in not having opulent sets and costumes.  There is meaning that Timothy's mother Donna (Judy McLane) chopped up her wedding gown to make angel wings for Timothy.  The school production looked good and realistically uncommercial.  The musical interludes were striking and engaging; the biggest production piece was a rock band version of the ""Pyramus and Thisbe"" play-within-a-play.The acting was very good.  Tanner Cohen does a fine job singing too.  The film is balanced so the adult characters actually get a very large share of the action.  This provides some fine character actors and additional humor.  The offset is that many of the student characters have much less definition.  This is an ensemble film rather than a deep-drilling one.This romantic comedy has no sex scenes or bad language.  It is an enjoyable fantasy.  There are frequent skin shots from students Jonathon, Cooper, Cole, Max, Ian (Zach Gray), Taylor (Alexander Aguilar), or Bradley (Yoni Solomon) and four dancers in the play.  Extras are a commentary track, the trailer, and four Wolfe Video previews.The producers were ambitious to combine romance, Shakespeare, comedy, and a gay sensibility with a youthful, less experienced cast.

I'm happy for those who have written glowing reviews of it and I think it does deserve praise but just not as much as others have showered on it.Its conceit is clever. Using Shakespeare's ""A Mid-Summer Night's Dream"" as the point of departure it weaves reality and fantasy together by way of a love potion which enables ""straights"" to be ""gay"" and for a brief while to have to walk in the shoes of the main character who is gay. Clever. And the acting of the entire cast is surprisingly good for such a small budget film. But in the end, at least for me, little things like a script which really was weaker than I had hoped, and editing which was sometimes amateurish, made the film less than I had hoped for it.Is it worth seeing? Definitely. It has things to say that are worth hearing. Is it worth buying? That depends on each individual and what they are looking for from such a film. It is a gay genre film and that's a genre that is still waiting for a writer to pen a master work that captures the gay experience and relates it to the straight world in a way that is true to both and able to dialogue in truth with both.This was a nice little attempt.

Dazzling, romantic, and heartbreaking, it's the tale of Timothy, a gay teen who's miserable in his small-town prep school and in unrequited lust with Jonathon, a handsome, popular rugby player.  When Timothy reluctantly auditions for the role of Puck in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" he surprises everyone, even Jonathon, with his talent.  Later Timothy discovers the recipe for a love potion hidden in the script, and creates it.  Does it work?  Wow, does it ever.  Armed with a prop pansy that sprays the magical elixir, Timothy turns the town upside down as starry-eyed same-sex couples snuggle in public or pursue unwilling partners, and Jonathon is finally in Timothy's arms... but is it real love or midsummer madness?I loved this movie.  The music is wonderful, and the musical numbers in the movie aren't Hollywood-style elaborate; there's a simplicity and roughness to them that really makes them believable as Timothy's fantasies.

1221508,A35IW20X5N3CEB,B001O0Z82U,Novelwit2000,"[0, 0]","This movie, oh my!  It achieved so much, I don't even know where to begin? But it's like it managed to cover a lot of ground--giving us the character Timothy.Timothy goes to a more affluent 'all boy' prep school where he is decidedly an underdog. I'll say this because it's just he and his mom, who is willing to sacrifice for him to go to this school.He has these two best friends: Frankie and Max (and I'll try to talk more on those two later.)Anyway, to me Timothy is just a regular guy who just happens to like other guys. Now how his fellow classmates know this is ANYBODY'S guess? Because Timothy certainly doesn't go around letting this fact known. Even though there IS this one guy whom he has a sort of crush on--Jonathan.Now of course, it's like they come from two different worlds--I'm gonna say that Timothy is more on the academic side of things and Jonathan is more of a jock.The thing that brings the two of them together is the senior play--a quasi re-working of Shakespeare's 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'.  It's something that neither one of these guys can get out of--the play being a senior requirement.Now at first, I thought there was a LOT of stuff going on in Timothy's head--like a lot of fantasy sequences that were going on that really weren't happening. This happened in the beginning, but I was glad when the story sort of shifted and it was more reality based.Anyway about the play, Timothy is cast as Puck--I'm going to say the 'main' fairy and Jonathan is one of the lovers in the play.While Timothy is going over reading the play at his house, he starts to really 'read' into the play, figuring out how he can make this potion--a sort of 'love' potion.I don't think he really knows this going in, only when his friend Max, who really is JUST his friend comes over, he accidentally squirts him with this stuff and instantly it's like Max starts going all 'lovey dovey' over him. It gets to the point where it really goes intense--maybe more for comic relief, though there is a sort of intensity that's there just the same--that I don't think was really necessary. (I guess what I'm trying to say is that Max was ALREADY a friend and an advocate to Timothy so to have him go 'gaga' over him was an overkill.)Anyway as rehearsals start on the play, it's here that Timothy sees where his potion can be of use to him--and in this, I'd say that the film is able to play out the underlying message of this film's theme: tolerance and finally acceptance.It's like there was a lesson that needed to be learned and in the end...not to give anything away...I think the message was learned.I think the musical numbers were spot on. I think the kids sounded like kids--the way they were supposed to be. If they were any 'better', it would take you out of the mood of the movie. I mean, there's a certain level that you expect from a student anyway.Overall, I'd say that this was quite an enjoyable movie musical. It had its message CERTAINLY and I heard it loud and clear!!!Watch for yourself and enjoy!!![This is just an adjunct to my earlier review--but, it's just that I enjoyed this movie so much that I just HAD to get a 'hard' copy of it.

Tanner Cohen--quite the find--is the lead character Timothy, a gay teenager in a boy's school who is constantly put upon because of his sexuality. Frustrated by his town's narrow-mindedness--and secretly longing for one of the school jocks named Jonathan--he is intrigued by the school play of AMSND arranged by his eccentric but wisely knowing drama teacher. Timothy tries out & is cast as the fairy Puck; it is from his readings that he discovers the ingredients for a love potion hidden within the very script. Embodied within the beauty of a purple flower, Timothy accidentally applies the new potion to his straight friend Max, and he cannot shake Max out of his smitten illusion for Timothy. Thus begins the fun as Timothy forces the town to, for once, ""see things through his eyes"" as homophobic school jocks fawn over each (and dance ballet during rugby practice), the jerk of a sports coach pines for the principal, and nearly all of the town's people are pursuing same-sex romances.Through all the pandemonium & criss-cross arrows that Cupid fires, Timothy does get his man...but is their love really true? In order to find out, the drama teacher encourages the townspeople to attend the play as the spell is finally broken. The result is pleasing as lessons are learned about accepting each other & various concepts of love...and to Timothy's surprise, does get his wish for true love.Experimenting with musical formats is nothing new in movies. Remember ""All That Jazz""? ""Pennies From Heaven""? Like the ""High School Musical"" franchise, the musical moments are there to highlight the feelings of Timothy & his wish fulfillment as imagination & fantasy take over. Occasionally, the pacing feels a bit jerky as the film stops & goes between the storytelling & the musical interludes, but it's still a fun & tantalizing movie to watch, with strong messages about prejudice & the dangerous powers of love.",5,It cast its spell on me!,1245542400,"06 21, 2009",2009,2013,"['Sexy', 'effervescent', 'World', 'Mine', 'gay', 'twist', 'play', 'Midsummer', 'Night', 'Dream', 'Tanner', 'Cohen', 'quite', 'find', 'lead', 'character', 'Timothy', 'gay', 'teenager', 'boy', 'school', 'who', 'constantly', 'put', 'sexuality', 'Frustrated', 'town', 'narrow-mindedness', 'secretly', 'longing', 'one', 'school', 'jocks', 'named', 'Jonathan', 'intrigued', 'school', 'play', 'AMSND', 'arranged', 'eccentric', 'wisely', 'knowing', 'drama', 'teacher', 'Timothy', 'out', 'cast', 'fairy', 'Puck', 'readings', 'ingredients', 'love', 'potion', 'hidden', 'very', 'script', 'Embodied', 'beauty', 'purple', 'flower', 'Timothy', 'accidentally', 'new', 'potion', 'straight', 'friend', 'Max', 'can', 'not', 'shake', 'Max', 'smitten', 'illusion', 'Timothy', 'Thus', 'fun', 'Timothy', 'town', 'once', 'see', 'things', 'eyes', 'homophobic', 'school', 'jocks', 'fawn', 'dance', 'ballet', 'rugby', 'practice', 'jerk', 'sports', 'coach', 'pines', 'principal', 'nearly', 'town', 'people', 'are', 'pursuing', 'same-sex', 'pandemonium', 'criss-cross', 'arrows', 'Cupid', 'fires', 'Timothy', 'get', 'man', 'love', 'really', 'true', 'order', 'find', 'out', 'drama', 'teacher', 'townspeople', 'attend', 'play', 'spell', 'finally', 'broken', 'result', 'pleasing', 'lessons', 'are', 'learned', 'accepting', 'other', 'various', 'concepts', 'love', 'Timothy', 'surprise', 'get', 'wish', 'true', 'love.Experimenting', 'musical', 'formats', 'nothing', 'new', 'movies', 'Remember', 'Jazz', 'Pennies', 'Heaven', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'franchise', 'musical', 'moments', 'are', 'there', 'highlight', 'feelings', 'Timothy', 'wish', 'fulfillment', 'imagination', 'fantasy', 'take', 'Occasionally', 'pacing', 'bit', 'jerky', 'film', 'storytelling', 'musical', 'interludes', 'still', 'fun', 'tantalizing', 'movie', 'watch', 'strong', 'messages', 'prejudice', 'dangerous', 'powers', 'love']",Were the World Mine

Our hero is an openly gay boy in a resolutely hetero and homophobic prep school.  Pushed to play the role of Puck in the school play because of his excellent singing voice, he initially resists playing a fairy although he has serious designs on one of the cast, who happens to be the school rugby star.  But our hero is charmed into it when Shakespeare's language leads him to create a magic potion that allows him to turn straight people gay.  Before long everyone in town seems to be mooning over someone of the same sex.  Complications ensue but a happy ending is revealed, with the foolish mortals being restored to their original situations--including the hunky rugby player who, it turns out, was a closet case with the hots for our hero all along!Although not a real musical, there are several delightful (if somewhat generic) songs which are woven into the narrative.  The cast is uniformly attractive, capable and appealing, and our two leads are really quite good.  The dialogue is not awkward or stilted, and the situation is remarkably literate, with a few inside jokes if you are familiar with the original.
