912473,AMY4RGZOEI4AC,B0009SCV6O,"Gigi R. ""Miss R.""","[8, 8]","I absolutely love this workout!! I feel completely energized once I have finished... yet completely challenged when I am doing it. It is fun and intense!! I am glad though that I skipped the beginner DVD and went straight to the intermediate after reading the reviews. This DVD is wonderful and the level of endorphins released after 30 minutes of exercise have me feeling cheerful and wonderful all day. I full heartedly recommend this DVD!! I owe a lot of fitness videos and DVDs and am constantly on the lookout for something that will challenge me even when I am pressed for time, I feel like I get the best workout in just 30 minutes. Not to mention if you follow the pace of the video you burn 500 calories in those 30 minutes! This is a wonderful addition to any workout collection. You should not be deterred from purchasing this DVD if you do not have a jump rope or the space to jump rope in. You can improvise with hand weights which is what I do and get even more of an upper-body challenge.",5,Excellent Work Out!!!!,1191196800,"10 1, 2007",2007,1003,"['absolutely', 'love', 'workout', 'feel', 'completely', 'energized', 'once', 'have', 'finished', 'yet', 'completely', 'challenged', 'when', 'am', 'doing', 'fun', 'intense', 'am', 'glad', 'skipped', 'beginner', 'DVD', 'went', 'straight', 'intermediate', 'reading', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'wonderful', 'level', 'endorphins', 'released', '30', 'minutes', 'exercise', 'have', 'feeling', 'cheerful', 'wonderful', 'day', 'full', 'heartedly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'owe', 'lot', 'fitness', 'videos', 'DVDs', 'am', 'constantly', 'lookout', 'something', 'will', 'challenge', 'even', 'when', 'am', 'pressed', 'time', 'feel', 'get', 'best', 'workout', 'just', '30', 'minutes', 'Not', 'mention', 'follow', 'pace', 'video', 'burn', '500', 'calories', '30', 'minutes', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'workout', 'collection', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'deterred', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'jump', 'rope', 'space', 'jump', 'rope', 'can', 'improvise', 'hand', 'weights', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'upper-body', 'challenge']",Ropesport: Intermediate Workout

I made the purchase thinking, ""this is going to be easy because I can jump rope"".  I actually LIKE to jump rope.  However, when I made the purchase, I wasn't thinking that there isn't space in the house to watch the video AND jump rope.  Therefore, I had to return it.  Good luck to those of you who have purchased it and have had success with it.

912476,A27QER42AD4IKI,B0009SCV6O,"originalwombman ""Living Simply""","[2, 3]","This workout was a good, fun workout.  I worked up a sweat and stayed engaged throughout the whole workout.  Louis Garcia is a good instructor, encouraging and easy to listen to.  There was a lot of variety in the workout and I could feel each different style of jump requiring different things from my body.  The workout had a lot of potential to be really great if a few changes had been made.  First, I wish the actual jumping segments were longer.  I felt like more time was spent doing resting moves that jumping.  More jumping would have increased the level of intensity and made it a truly intermediate level workout.  As is, I'd say this is an advanced beginner workout.  Secondly, the workout, including warm-up and cool-down was about 30 minutes long.  Again, if it's going to be that short, there really needed to have been more jumping.  Also, I thought the warm-up should have been more movement oriented since the work-out is jumping.  Instead, Garcia went with stationary stretches.  The cool-down was a repeat of the same stretches.  I had to add additional stretches to make sure that I stretched out each part of my body.  Lastly the two ""celebrities"" are a real distraction and detract from the overall workout, especially Eric Nies.  I feel that they should not have been such a prominent part of the workout.  Nies even interjects purely superfluous commentary while Garcia is giving instructions.  The two of them are just really unnecessary but at least Kelly Packard is tolerable.I really like this dvd series because it provided me with a repertoire of different jumping styles.  While I'm not at the point where I could put together and follow my own routine, I've learned a lot about technique and so I think if I stick with it, I will get to that point sooner than later.  Slowly, I am building endurance and coordination in jumping rope..  Overall, it's worth it to do this workout as an introduction to jumping rope for the cardio portion of your workout routine.",4,Satisfactory and Fun Workout,1263859200,"01 19, 2010",2010,1993,"['workout', 'was', 'good', 'fun', 'workout', 'worked', 'up', 'sweat', 'stayed', 'engaged', 'whole', 'workout', 'Louis', 'Garcia', 'good', 'instructor', 'encouraging', 'easy', 'listen', 'was', 'lot', 'variety', 'workout', 'could', 'feel', 'different', 'style', 'jump', 'requiring', 'different', 'things', 'body', 'workout', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'be', 'really', 'great', 'few', 'changes', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'First', 'wish', 'actual', 'jumping', 'segments', 'were', 'longer', 'felt', 'more', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'doing', 'resting', 'moves', 'jumping', 'More', 'jumping', 'would', 'have', 'increased', 'level', 'intensity', 'made', 'truly', 'intermediate', 'level', 'workout', ""'d"", 'say', 'advanced', 'beginner', 'workout', 'Secondly', 'workout', 'including', 'warm-up', 'cool-down', 'was', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'Again', 'going', 'be', 'short', 'really', 'needed', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'jumping', 'Also', 'thought', 'warm-up', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'movement', 'oriented', 'work-out', 'jumping', 'Instead', 'Garcia', 'went', 'stationary', 'stretches', 'cool-down', 'was', 'repeat', 'same', 'stretches', 'had', 'add', 'additional', 'stretches', 'make', 'sure', 'stretched', 'out', 'part', 'body', 'Lastly', 'two', 'celebrities', 'are', 'real', 'distraction', 'detract', 'overall', 'workout', 'especially', 'Eric', 'Nies', 'feel', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'prominent', 'part', 'workout', 'Nies', 'even', 'purely', 'superfluous', 'commentary', 'Garcia', 'giving', 'instructions', 'two', 'are', 'just', 'really', 'unnecessary', 'least', 'Kelly', 'Packard', 'tolerable.I', 'really', 'dvd', 'series', 'provided', 'repertoire', 'different', 'jumping', 'styles', ""'m"", 'not', 'point', 'where', 'could', 'put', 'together', 'follow', 'own', 'routine', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'lot', 'technique', 'so', 'think', 'stick', 'will', 'get', 'point', 'sooner', 'later', 'Slowly', 'am', 'building', 'endurance', 'coordination', 'jumping', 'rope..', 'Overall', 'worth', 'do', 'workout', 'introduction', 'jumping', 'rope', 'cardio', 'portion', 'workout', 'routine']",Ropesport: Intermediate Workout
