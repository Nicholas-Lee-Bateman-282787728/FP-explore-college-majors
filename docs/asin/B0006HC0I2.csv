Alexander ""once met........................""","[2, 2]","There are not many words by which to describe the awesome 'combination' of the Sir Laurence Olivier/Marlon Brando 'version' of One of the most well-accomplished French Actors, ever to 'explode' upon the Silver Screen, the magnificent, Jean Gabin. This motion picture ""Touchez Pas au Grisbi"", is, about loyalty, the macho camaraderie binding the 'participants', as well as the unwritten law of never 'grassing up' your 'mates.' The word ""loyalty"" which is the clear message this film conveys, suggests, that, any man who is disloyal, lacks in character, and, basic moral fibre.

868281,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0006HC0I2,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 2]","Hey, I have been touting crime noir films for the past couple of years so why not review, as here with Jean Gabin's 1954 Touchez Pas au Grisbi, a French crime noir in honor of, well, the name of the genre. And a later generation of French directors who went crazy for Hollywood gangster epics in such films as ""Breathless"" and Don't Shoot The Piano Player. Especially when said this crime noir stars Jean Gabin, last reviewed here in a very different film, Children Of Paradise.Well, let's cut to the chase (literally, as this plot unfolds). It seems that long- time crime boss Max (Gabin) has pulled a caper (heist, okay) to set himself and his confederate Riton up for a well-deserved retirement from the rackets. And everything was going along just fine until old buddy Riton got a loose tongue over some show girl (played by a very young Jean Moreau) and spilled his guts out to her about how he could keep her in clover. Problem is that young showgirls are as fickle and calculating as any other woman mixed up with bad actuarial table criminals and she has another crime boss on the hook, one Angelo. Naturally she mentions the loot to Angelo and sets off an explosion of maneuvers by him to get the kale, and by Max to keep it.The cat and mouse of this pair drives the rest of the movie with old Max showing one and all why he was (and is) the king of the hill, even if he may have lost a step or two. Angelo's big mistake (besides thinking that Max was over the hill and easy pickings) was kidnapping Riton, an act that set Max on a fight to the finish. See the film to get the details of that fight to the finish. What is important though is the use by the director here of the many tough guy moves made by Hollywood gangsters in the heyday 1930s including a few off-hand beatings of opponent gangsters to get information, a few off-hand slaps at show girls (by Gabin of all people but that is part of being a boss and no chump), and a car chase, natch complete with machine guns ta-ta-ta-ing. Ya, the French picked up the genre very nicely. Gabin might be a little too suave (except for those off-hand girl slaps) to be an American 1930s gangster but he fit the more demure 1950s just right.",5,That's Where The Money Is,1338249600,"05 29, 2012",2012,2201,"['Hey', 'have', 'been', 'touting', 'crime', 'noir', 'films', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'review', 'here', 'Jean', 'Gabin', '1954', 'Touchez', 'Pas', 'au', 'Grisbi', 'French', 'crime', 'noir', 'honor', 'well', 'name', 'genre', 'later', 'generation', 'French', 'directors', 'who', 'went', 'crazy', 'Hollywood', 'gangster', 'epics', 'such', 'films', 'Breathless', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Shoot', 'Piano', 'Player', 'Especially', 'when', 'said', 'crime', 'noir', 'stars', 'Jean', 'Gabin', 'last', 'reviewed', 'here', 'very', 'different', 'film', 'Children', 'Paradise.Well', 'let', 'cut', 'chase', 'literally', 'plot', 'long-', 'time', 'crime', 'boss', 'Max', 'Gabin', 'pulled', 'caper', 'heist', 'okay', 'set', 'confederate', 'Riton', 'up', 'well-deserved', 'retirement', 'rackets', 'everything', 'was', 'going', 'along', 'just', 'fine', 'old', 'buddy', 'Riton', 'got', 'loose', 'tongue', 'show', 'girl', 'played', 'very', 'young', 'Jean', 'Moreau', 'spilled', 'guts', 'out', 'how', 'could', 'keep', 'clover', 'Problem', 'young', 'showgirls', 'are', 'fickle', 'calculating', 'other', 'woman', 'mixed', 'up', 'bad', 'actuarial', 'table', 'criminals', 'crime', 'boss', 'hook', 'one', 'Angelo', 'Naturally', 'loot', 'Angelo', 'off', 'explosion', 'maneuvers', 'get', 'kale', 'Max', 'keep', 'it.The', 'cat', 'mouse', 'pair', 'rest', 'movie', 'old', 'Max', 'showing', 'one', 'why', 'was', 'king', 'hill', 'even', 'may', 'have', 'lost', 'step', 'two', 'Angelo', 'big', 'mistake', 'thinking', 'Max', 'was', 'hill', 'easy', 'pickings', 'was', 'kidnapping', 'Riton', 'act', 'set', 'Max', 'fight', 'finish', 'See', 'film', 'get', 'details', 'fight', 'finish', 'What', 'important', 'use', 'director', 'here', 'many', 'tough', 'guy', 'moves', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'gangsters', 'heyday', '1930s', 'including', 'few', 'off-hand', 'beatings', 'opponent', 'gangsters', 'get', 'information', 'few', 'off-hand', 'slaps', 'show', 'girls', 'Gabin', 'people', 'part', 'being', 'boss', 'chump', 'car', 'chase', 'natch', 'complete', 'machine', 'guns', 'ta-ta-ta-ing', 'Ya', 'French', 'picked', 'up', 'genre', 'very', 'nicely', 'Gabin', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'suave', 'off-hand', 'girl', 'slaps', 'be', 'American', '1930s', 'gangster', 'fit', 'more', 'demure', '1950s', 'just', 'right']",N/A

Under the expert and loving hands of the folks at Criterion, we have an absolutely pristine print of this understated and refined French gangster movie. Watching the Criterion DVD is to fall completely into the film, as the restored black and white images are simply glorious.This movie is not like today's heavy-handed violent gangster movies, but a more elegant and sophisticated presentation that focuses on character development and its themes of loyalty, betrayal, and an adherence to a moral code. Jean Gabin, who plays the urbane and respected criminal Max, is the soul of this movie, presenting Max as charming, stoic, and ruthless. Great detail is given to ordinary tasks, like the serving of a meal, brushing of one's teeth, etc., but the effect, instead of arty, goes to the development of the characters and the portrayal of them as regular folks.Lest you believe this is a slow talky picture, there are moments of explosive violence that will send a chill through you. Suspense is created through the most effective of methods: by what you don't see and what is filled in by one's own imagination. As the tension mounts in the movie, you will be glued to the screen gripping the arms of your chair with withering anticipation. They don't make 'em like this anymore, neither here nor in Europe. This movie is a fine example of both  French cinema before the New Wave, and of the gangster genre.In any language, TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI means film excellence, especially after the careful, painstaking restoration by Criterion Studios.",5,"""The Celler Is Better - No One Will Hear Him Scream.""",1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,1605,"['fine', 'wine', 'TOUCHEZ', 'PAS', 'AU', 'GRISBI', 'aged', 'wonderfully', 'expert', 'loving', 'hands', 'folks', 'Criterion', 'have', 'absolutely', 'pristine', 'print', 'understated', 'refined', 'French', 'gangster', 'movie', 'Watching', 'Criterion', 'DVD', 'fall', 'completely', 'film', 'restored', 'black', 'white', 'images', 'are', 'simply', 'glorious.This', 'movie', 'not', 'today', 'heavy-handed', 'violent', 'gangster', 'movies', 'more', 'elegant', 'sophisticated', 'presentation', 'character', 'development', 'themes', 'loyalty', 'betrayal', 'adherence', 'moral', 'code', 'Jean', 'Gabin', 'who', 'urbane', 'respected', 'criminal', 'Max', 'soul', 'movie', 'presenting', 'Max', 'charming', 'stoic', 'ruthless', 'Great', 'detail', 'given', 'ordinary', 'tasks', 'serving', 'meal', 'brushing', 'one', 'teeth', 'etc.', 'effect', 'instead', 'arty', 'development', 'characters', 'portrayal', 'regular', 'folks.Lest', 'believe', 'slow', 'talky', 'picture', 'are', 'moments', 'explosive', 'violence', 'will', 'send', 'chill', 'Suspense', 'created', 'most', 'effective', 'methods', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'filled', 'one', 'own', 'imagination', 'tension', 'mounts', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'glued', 'screen', 'gripping', 'arms', 'chair', 'withering', 'anticipation', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', ""'em"", 'like', 'anymore', 'here', 'Europe', 'movie', 'fine', 'example', 'French', 'cinema', 'New', 'Wave', 'gangster', 'genre.In', 'language', 'TOUCHEZ', 'PAS', 'AU', 'GRISBI', 'film', 'excellence', 'especially', 'careful', 'painstaking', 'restoration', 'Criterion', 'Studios']",N/A

868285,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0006HC0I2,C. O. DeRiemer,"[5, 6]","This is a film I like a lot. I like the way it spends the first half of the movie setting up the situation, getting us into the milieu and letting us know the characters. Everyone seems to be tough but you don't know just how tough until the second half of the movie starts rolling. And if I could transform myself into the style of one actor, it would be Jean Gabin. He dominates the movie effortlessly, in every way from how he moves, gives a shrug and a half smile, pulls a chair for his mistress and then places his hands momentarily on her shoulders, stares at a punk who is being deliberately hurt to make him talk. Gabin was 50 when he made this movie and looks it. He could have passed for 60. He's getting a little thick in the middle, his eyes have bags and his neckline sags. He has no vanity. His character points this all out to his friend Riton when he tries to talk a little sense to his friend. And as fascinating a character as Max is, it doesn't take long before you realize that, if he were really upset with you, he could kill you with barely a second thought.Part of the pleasure of the movie also is the other characters. With a number of them I was kept a little off balance. Angelo at first comes off as a tough gangster. But then you realize that he's not only tough, but he's smart. Pierrot also kept me guessing. What role was he playing? I kept assuming he was just probably a slimy nightclub owner ready to betray anyone. Then it turns out he's ready to back up Max even when it gets dangerous.And of course some of the pleasure of the movie is that it isn't just a first rate film of gangsters and criminal style. It's even more about friendship and about the years catching up with us all. Max's interior monologue about his friend Riton is not only touching, it went a long way to explaining who Max himself was. The end, when Max has to put on a pair of glasses to check a phone number, is a satisfying way to conclude Max's story.The Criterion DVD picture is great and the interviews are interesting.

In our contemporary society this confusion is frequently expressed through flamboyance, which is usually the result of how money talks.  However, this vain perception of class has nothing to do with one's self conduct. Refinement, sophistication, and class are qualities that should be attached with characteristics such as trust, confidence, and mutual respect.  These qualities are what define a gentleman. When people see a true gentleman they only see the exterior, and it is this exterior that money buys.The days of gentlemen criminals are long gone.  Films such as Scarface (1983), New Jack City (1991), or any of Takashi Miike's violent gangster illustrations depict the new style of gangsters that contemporary society is facing where disloyal and ill-mannered thugs roll in the direction of dough.  These films visualize the frightening power money has on people.  This could be seen up close in a grotesque manner in the brilliant Maria Full of Grace (2004) where humans are being regarded as pack mules.  Touchez Pas Au Grisbi, which was shot over a half century ago, depicts the coming of this new criminal element.Nostalgia swallows Jacques Becker's crime story about the aging criminal and gentleman Max (Jean Gabin).  The story takes place in Paris where Max lives life with a women half his age while spending untold numbers of nights desiring the same meaningless affection from the women seeking their way into men's wallets.  The many visits to the night clubs have led Max to discover that he has grown old, and many of the people around him are older.  The life he once desired is no longer as appealing, as he decides that he wants to return home early.  Max even discloses this to his friend Riton (Ren&eacute; Dary) while having found out that Riton's young girlfriend has found a younger lover, as she has previously given Riton empty promises of love.The professional life, which Max has chosen for himself is also undergoing a transformation.  Younger generations are cutting into the growing drug business without the consideration of others, and these young newcomers show little class while they trample on everyone in their sight.  Recently Max carried out a job that brought him and his partner Riton 50 million worth in Orly gold bars.  This was to be Max's final job before retirement, however, the newcomers in the criminal underworld seem to want change his destiny.Touchez Pas Au Grisbi is a stunning gangster tale where the old ways are to face off with the new.  This is depicted through Max who is undergoing a personal life changing experience, as he is confronted by events around him that make him question what he is doing.  The character that Jean Gabin delivers to the screen is marvelously multifaceted, as he portrays the gentleman thief by being a tender lover, clever diplomat, friendly patron, and firm interrogator.  The cast around Gabin also displays nice work as they all accentuate Max's uniqueness by being fairly simple characters.

868292,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B0006HC0I2,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[4, 4]","This film, made in 1954, is an ironic look at an ageing gangster ready to go into retirement, having pulled off one last heist - several bars of gold - which gets him into a life and death conflict with several younger hoods plotting to steal it from him. He is accompanied by a long-time partner, and director Becker makes much of the friendship between them as they talk of getting too old for the life of night clubbing and show girls. Gabin is wonderful in this role, rarely smiling, often a little bored, while maintaining an air of gravitas appropriate for a suave, well dressed man of considerable reputation among his peers.The film moves rather slowly as it sets up the situation while taking time to humanize the characters, but eventually there is excitement enough as a kidnapping leads to a dramatic car chase, automatic gunfire, and explosives. The script is tightly knit, taking place over a period of 36 hours, and the cinematography is impressive for the time, as so much was shot in the streets of night-time Paris or in the darkened countryside (actually the Riviera). A revealing ""floor show"" is also in stark contrast to the Production Code-regulated exposure of skin permitted in Hollywood films of the 1950s.As the interviews on this DVD reveal, only Gabin among its cast (including Lino Venturra and a very young Jeanne Moreau) was known to film audiences at the time, and Gabin had long since ceased being a bankable ""star."" This film was a comeback role for him and it helped launch the careers of Venturra and Moreau.

Wong ""stan the man""","[2, 2]","I just wanted to post this review to give it the 5 stars that it deserves.I won't be as detailed in my review but the prior reviews have said what I have been thinking about this movie for the past 12 months.I rewatched this wonderful movie last night.  I must say...Jean Gabin is such an incredible actor.  So much like our Spencer Tracy except he can say so much with just a glance and a mere change in his facial expression can say it all.  I have seen him in some incredible Jean Renoirs and other movies of his from the 1930's...it is so neat to constrast the world weary 1954 Gabin character with his lively traveler from 20 years earlier.This film is frank, brutally honest about aging criminals who operated with a touch of class.  They resorted to primitive violence when they needed to.I love contrasting this free film w/ the tighter censorship of American film noirs.  It is darker and it just seems more realistic than the typical Hollywood film noir treatment.  The skating around the expression of female nudity (granted they were pictures on the wall of the nightclub) and seduction scenes were fascinating to contrast too.The female actresses were fun to watch and linger over.  Some were absolutely beautiful and support the claim of France having some incredible women.I love how all the characters were developed slowly and it closes with a finger gripping climax.  I was NEVER bored from the first minute on.I cannot recommend this movie any more than I am now.  If you are a fan of Jean Gabin, French movies pre-new Wave, or if you don't mind subtitles for your crime dramas...enjoy this tightly scripted 94 minute film.

In another triumph of classic French cinema, Jacques Becker's tight - 94 minutes--black and white action/ crime thriller/film noir stars Jean Gabin(Grand Illusion - Criterion Collection,Essential Art House: Le Jour se L&egrave;ve) as Max, called le Menteur, an aging, world-weary gentlemanly gangster who believes he can retire after he and his friend Henri Ducros, known as Riton, make a big score: eight bars of gold, then worth 50 million francs.  But he soon discovers that a competitor has his eye on the takings: brutal crime boss Angelo Fraiser (Lino Ventura ,SICILIAN CLAN (1969)), who heard about the job from round-heeled chorus girl Josy, (Jeanne Moreau -Jules and Jim - Criterion Collection).Becker (Casque d'Or - Criterion Collection,Le Trou - Criterion Collection), is known to have enjoyed making gangster flicks, and he made a few.  This one, filmed in a Paris that seems to sparkle, is, in fact, as dark, gritty, and exciting as any he made.  It was a hit when released, despite the fact that, at that time, it was considered to have no stars.  Gabin had had a number of flops, and was perceived as being washed-up: this movie proved his comeback vehicle.  Ventura would go on to make more than 50 films, but this was his first--someone had recommended him to the director as a man who looked like a gangster; at the time, having been a wrestler, he was working as a wrestling promoter.  Moreau was very young, and if it wasn't her first film, she hadn't made many - she hardly looks like herself.  Daniel Cauchy, who played Fifi, a young member of Angelo's gang, was also making his first movie: he'd been an illustrator.  But someone had recommended him, too, to the director as a man who looked like a gangster.  He would go on to do 20 years of gangster pictures, includingBob le Flambeur - Criterion Collection.This film was, to be sure, highly influential on the crime films that would follow.  It's absorbing, character-driven, with considerations of love, friendship and morality at its heart.  The script is faultless: the picture is hard-charging and hard-edged, tough, yet it has an evocative, romantic atmosphere.  The director's treatment of the crime milieu is matter-of-fact, his tale narrated with great understatement, then, surprising violent episodes.  Gabin turns in his usual man of the people performance: hardened, but humorous. It's a powerful movie that works its way to a shootout on dark, empty country roads, with an ending no viewer will soon forget.",5,Gabin's Comeback Vehicle,1302652800,"04 13, 2011",2011,2556,"['Touchez', 'Pas', 'au', 'Grisbi', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Touch', 'Loot', '1954', 'triumph', 'classic', 'French', 'cinema', 'Jacques', 'Becker', 'tight', '94', 'minutes', 'black', 'white', 'action/', 'crime', 'thriller/film', 'noir', 'stars', 'Jean', 'Gabin', 'Grand', 'Illusion', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Essential', 'Art', 'House', 'Le', 'Jour', 'se', 'L', 'egrave', 've', 'Max', 'called', 'le', 'Menteur', 'aging', 'world-weary', 'gentlemanly', 'gangster', 'who', 'can', 'retire', 'friend', 'Henri', 'Ducros', 'known', 'Riton', 'make', 'big', 'score', 'eight', 'bars', 'gold', 'then', '50', 'million', 'francs', 'soon', 'competitor', 'eye', 'takings', 'brutal', 'crime', 'boss', 'Angelo', 'Fraiser', 'Lino', 'Ventura', 'SICILIAN', 'CLAN', '1969', 'who', 'heard', 'job', 'round-heeled', 'chorus', 'girl', 'Josy', 'Jeanne', 'Moreau', '-Jules', 'Jim', 'Criterion', 'Collection', '.Becker', 'Casque', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Le', 'Trou', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'known', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'making', 'gangster', 'flicks', 'made', 'few', 'one', 'filmed', 'Paris', 'sparkle', 'fact', 'dark', 'gritty', 'exciting', 'made', 'was', 'hit', 'when', 'released', 'fact', 'time', 'was', 'considered', 'have', 'stars', 'Gabin', 'had', 'had', 'number', 'flops', 'was', 'perceived', 'being', 'washed-up', 'movie', 'proved', 'comeback', 'vehicle', 'Ventura', 'would', 'go', 'make', 'more', '50', 'films', 'was', 'first', 'someone', 'had', 'recommended', 'director', 'man', 'who', 'looked', 'gangster', 'time', 'having', 'been', 'wrestler', 'was', 'working', 'wrestling', 'promoter', 'Moreau', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'made', 'many', 'hardly', 'Daniel', 'Cauchy', 'who', 'played', 'Fifi', 'young', 'member', 'Angelo', 'gang', 'was', 'also', 'making', 'first', 'movie', ""'d"", 'been', 'illustrator', 'someone', 'had', 'recommended', 'too', 'director', 'man', 'who', 'looked', 'gangster', 'would', 'go', 'do', '20', 'years', 'gangster', 'pictures', 'includingBob', 'le', 'Flambeur', 'Criterion', 'Collection.This', 'film', 'was', 'be', 'sure', 'highly', 'influential', 'crime', 'films', 'would', 'follow', 'absorbing', 'character-driven', 'considerations', 'love', 'friendship', 'morality', 'heart', 'script', 'faultless', 'picture', 'hard-charging', 'hard-edged', 'tough', 'evocative', 'romantic', 'atmosphere', 'director', 'treatment', 'crime', 'milieu', 'matter-of-fact', 'tale', 'narrated', 'great', 'understatement', 'then', 'surprising', 'violent', 'episodes', 'Gabin', 'usual', 'man', 'people', 'performance', 'hardened', 'humorous', 'powerful', 'movie', 'way', 'shootout', 'dark', 'empty', 'country', 'roads', 'ending', 'viewer', 'will', 'soon', 'forget']",N/A

868297,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B0006HC0I2,Trevor Willsmer,"[3, 3]","Seen today, Touchez Pas Au Grisbi seems like Jean Gabin's last great role, but in 1954 it was seen as his comeback after a slew of disappointing post-war films that were generally fairly average on their own merits even when not compared to his remarkable run of pre-war classics. Certainly he was the right actor at the right time when his career, like the old-school thief he plays, was beginning to look like it was over. The old Gabin is still recognisable but the rot has set in, and it's that combination of a class act that has outlived his time that makes his perfect casting performance so remarkable. He's a bit of a moaner and feels his age: constantly weary, he's got to that time in his life when he wants to go to bed early because if he stays up after midnight he feels like he's working overtime. Far from the doomed romantics he specialised in during his Thirties prime, he's a faded man edging into the shadows - in one remarkable shot even a lit match casts no light on his face - in a film that takes a lot of the glamour off both its star and its genre. He and his longtime, not too smart partner have pulled their last job before the film even starts, and the inevitable violence and tragedy come from his attempts to keep his newly acquired `pension' - the grisbi (loot) of the title - from rival crooks.There's no romance or honour among thieves here. From the clubs where the `dancers' do little more than walk across the stage to the restaurants that shun the slumming socialite crowd, it's a mediocre, artificial world they inhabit, where packs of criminals aren't loyal unless it suits them, where almost everyone either expresses disappointment or hides behind insincere clich&eacute;d expressions of admiration and loyalty. For director Jacques Becker how his low lives go about the everyday business of living is as important as the plot, and strangely it's surprisingly compelling too despite what is happening often being so mundane. You can feel the cold of the rarely used apartment he and Ren&eacute; Dary's Riton eat their crackers and pate in before breaking out their pajamas, brushing their teeth and going to bed early just as vividly as you can feel the crisp night air of a roadside hostage exchange that goes disastrously wrong.If that sounds perhaps too grim and austere, the film is anything but. Beautifully directed by Becker, whose reputation has sadly faded over the years - indeed, for a long time this, perhaps his most famous film, was out of circulation in English speaking territories - and featuring Lino Ventura in his first role and an early appearance by Jeanne Moreau, it's one of the best French thrillers ever made and it's easy to see why it's been such a huge influence on the crime genre. The UK DVD is a good presentation as is the original StudioCanal French DVD, but not unexpectedly, Criterion's Region 1 NTSC DVD outdoes it as far as supplements go: a lengthy extract from French TV series Cin&eacute;astes de Notre Temps, an entertaining and insightful 2002 interview with supporting player Daniel Cauchy, who reveals why his character really didn't make it to the film's finale, a 1972 interview with Lino Ventura, a 1978 interview with composer Jean Wiener, the original French theatrical trailer and detailed liner notes.",5,Gabin and Becker at their melancholy best,1284076800,"09 10, 2010",2010,3295,"['Seen', 'today', 'Touchez', 'Pas', 'Au', 'Grisbi', 'Jean', 'Gabin', 'last', 'great', 'role', '1954', 'was', 'seen', 'comeback', 'slew', 'disappointing', 'post-war', 'films', 'were', 'generally', 'fairly', 'average', 'own', 'merits', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'compared', 'remarkable', 'run', 'pre-war', 'classics', 'Certainly', 'was', 'right', 'actor', 'right', 'time', 'when', 'career', 'old-school', 'thief', 'was', 'beginning', 'look', 'was', 'over', 'old', 'Gabin', 'still', 'recognisable', 'rot', 'set', 'combination', 'class', 'act', 'outlived', 'time', 'perfect', 'casting', 'performance', 'so', 'remarkable', 'bit', 'moaner', 'feels', 'age', 'constantly', 'weary', 'got', 'time', 'life', 'when', 'go', 'bed', 'early', 'up', 'midnight', 'working', 'overtime', 'Far', 'doomed', 'romantics', 'specialised', 'Thirties', 'prime', 'faded', 'man', 'edging', 'shadows', 'one', 'remarkable', 'shot', 'even', 'lit', 'match', 'light', 'face', 'film', 'lot', 'glamour', 'star', 'genre', 'longtime', 'not', 'too', 'smart', 'partner', 'have', 'pulled', 'last', 'job', 'film', 'even', 'inevitable', 'violence', 'tragedy', 'come', 'attempts', 'keep', 'newly', 'acquired', 'pension', 'grisbi', 'loot', 'title', 'rival', 'romance', 'honour', 'thieves', 'here', 'clubs', 'where', 'dancers', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'walk', 'stage', 'restaurants', 'shun', 'slumming', 'socialite', 'crowd', 'mediocre', 'artificial', 'world', 'inhabit', 'where', 'packs', 'criminals', 'are', ""n't"", 'loyal', 'suits', 'where', 'almost', 'everyone', 'disappointment', 'hides', 'insincere', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'expressions', 'admiration', 'loyalty', 'director', 'Jacques', 'Becker', 'how', 'low', 'lives', 'go', 'everyday', 'business', 'living', 'as', 'important', 'plot', 'strangely', 'surprisingly', 'compelling', 'too', 'what', 'happening', 'often', 'being', 'so', 'mundane', 'can', 'feel', 'cold', 'rarely', 'used', 'apartment', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Dary', 'Riton', 'crackers', 'pate', 'breaking', 'out', 'pajamas', 'brushing', 'teeth', 'going', 'bed', 'early', 'just', 'as', 'vividly', 'can', 'feel', 'crisp', 'night', 'air', 'roadside', 'hostage', 'exchange', 'disastrously', 'wrong.If', 'perhaps', 'too', 'grim', 'austere', 'film', 'anything', 'Beautifully', 'directed', 'Becker', 'reputation', 'sadly', 'faded', 'years', 'indeed', 'long', 'time', 'perhaps', 'most', 'famous', 'film', 'was', 'circulation', 'English', 'speaking', 'territories', 'featuring', 'Lino', 'Ventura', 'first', 'role', 'early', 'appearance', 'Jeanne', 'Moreau', 'one', 'best', 'French', 'thrillers', 'ever', 'made', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'been', 'huge', 'influence', 'crime', 'genre', 'UK', 'DVD', 'good', 'presentation', 'original', 'StudioCanal', 'French', 'DVD', 'not', 'unexpectedly', 'Criterion', 'Region', '1', 'NTSC', 'DVD', 'as', 'far', 'supplements', 'go', 'lengthy', 'extract', 'French', 'TV', 'series', 'Cin', 'eacute', 'Notre', 'Temps', 'entertaining', 'insightful', '2002', 'interview', 'supporting', 'player', 'Daniel', 'Cauchy', 'who', 'why', 'character', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'finale', '1972', 'interview', 'Lino', 'Ventura', '1978', 'interview', 'composer', 'Jean', 'Wiener', 'original', 'French', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'detailed', 'liner', 'notes']",N/A

Having watched Rififi, which I particularly enjoyed for its excitement and realism, and having watched Bob le Flambeur, which I didn't particularly enjoy, as I said I came to Touchez Pas Au Grisbi just hoping I would like it and nothing more.Well, what can I say? I really enjoyed this movie, and Jean Gabin, the chief player in the movie, is more understated and stoic as a gang boss, than temperamental and over the top, and all the other actors played believable parts which for me help the plot, and the twist and turns in the plot, go well.The heist of the movie has already taken place before the movie starts, and revolves around two aging gangsters trying to get around 50 million francs for gold bullion. While they are waiting for the (considerably lot less) money, another gangster has other plans, and kidnaps one of the gangsters to swap him in return for the loot. I won't tell you the plot any further, and if you like French films, and particularly French gangster films, I think you will enjoy this a lot, as I did.",5,Enjoyable French gangster film!,1370563200,"06 7, 2013",2013,1082,"['watched', 'be', 'honest', 'expectations', 'Having', 'watched', 'Rififi', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'excitement', 'realism', 'having', 'watched', 'Bob', 'le', 'Flambeur', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'enjoy', 'said', 'came', 'Touchez', 'Pas', 'Au', 'Grisbi', 'just', 'hoping', 'would', 'like', 'nothing', 'more.Well', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Jean', 'Gabin', 'chief', 'player', 'movie', 'more', 'understated', 'stoic', 'gang', 'boss', 'temperamental', 'top', 'other', 'actors', 'played', 'believable', 'parts', 'help', 'plot', 'twist', 'plot', 'go', 'well.The', 'heist', 'movie', 'already', 'taken', 'place', 'movie', 'around', 'two', 'aging', 'gangsters', 'trying', 'get', '50', 'million', 'francs', 'gold', 'bullion', 'are', 'waiting', 'considerably', 'lot', 'less', 'money', 'gangster', 'other', 'plans', 'one', 'gangsters', 'swap', 'return', 'loot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'plot', 'further', 'like', 'French', 'films', 'particularly', 'French', 'gangster', 'films', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'lot', 'did']",N/A
