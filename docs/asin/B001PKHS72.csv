1227271,A2CKMDS10RKS50,B001PKHS72,Chris,"[2, 3]","A Woman Called Golda was originally made as a two-part television miniseries. It is an important movie on several levels, perhaps mostly because it tells the story of the State of Israel but also because it is the last film appearance by Ingrid Bergman. This is not light entertainment (at almost four hours) to be viewed casually by a fan of the late and beautiful Swedish actress.  Those who remember Golda Meir know that whatever her many fine and great qualities, she was not a beauty. Ingrid wears her hair in the tight, pulled back style of Golda and is as unglamorous as she can be. However, Ingrid is brilliant in this role and this is a fitting, crowning achievement to her career.  This film should be seen to remind us of a great world leader portrayed by one of the greatest stars of all time.I give this movie only four stars because of its length, and because Ingrid Bergman appears in about one third of the actual movie. A younger actress portrays the young Golda, and there is much historical footage.  It is very well done, but it is a serious work.

Golda Meir's life traced itself from the Russian Empire to the American Jewish Diaspora to the formation of Israel and through the pivotal times of war and peace.Originally run as a television mini-series, this film shows her childhood, life on a kibbutz, early days in Israel, and times as Foreign Minister and Prime Minister in good detail, both personal and professional, to give a real sense of the woman and the political figure.  From her childhood she was a determined person; her shakey marriage with Morris Meyerson is depicted with sensitivity (Leonard Nimoy plays the long-suffering Meyerson).  Her ideas of hope and her determination for both security and peace are depicted with passion and humor.Watch for cameos from people such as Ned Beatty (who plays an American senator being strong-armed into selling advanced weaponry to Israel), Nigel Hawthorne (in quite a bit of make-up as the King of Jordan who lays the political reality out for Golda Meir as to why he can't initiate peace and live), and Robert Loggia (as Anwar Sadat).The story has good pacing; much is done in flash-back form.  In part it is done through narrative device of one of Golda's political secretaries, Lou Kaddar, played by Anne Jackson.  I loved the scene where Lou Kaddar interviews for the job with Golda, and presents a letter as a sample of her writing.  The letter is in praise of her former employer; ""He sounds like an outstanding man,"" Golda says, to which Lou Kaddar responds, ""He was a son of a *bleep*.""  Golda, without missing a beat, simply replies, ""You might do well at this job.""It has been a long time coming, but it is worth the wait.",5,At long last...,1240531200,"04 24, 2009",2009,1773,"['Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'playing', 'Iron', 'Lady', 'Golda', 'Meir', 'Thatcher', 'was', 'Golda', 'Golda', 'Meir', 'life', 'traced', 'Russian', 'Empire', 'American', 'Jewish', 'Diaspora', 'formation', 'Israel', 'pivotal', 'times', 'war', 'peace.Originally', 'run', 'television', 'mini-series', 'film', 'childhood', 'life', 'kibbutz', 'early', 'days', 'Israel', 'times', 'Foreign', 'Minister', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'good', 'detail', 'personal', 'professional', 'give', 'real', 'sense', 'woman', 'political', 'figure', 'childhood', 'was', 'determined', 'person', 'shakey', 'marriage', 'Morris', 'Meyerson', 'depicted', 'sensitivity', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'long-suffering', 'Meyerson', 'ideas', 'hope', 'determination', 'security', 'peace', 'are', 'depicted', 'passion', 'humor.Watch', 'cameos', 'people', 'such', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'who', 'American', 'senator', 'being', 'strong-armed', 'selling', 'advanced', 'weaponry', 'Israel', 'Nigel', 'Hawthorne', 'quite', 'bit', 'make-up', 'King', 'Jordan', 'who', 'political', 'reality', 'Golda', 'Meir', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'initiate', 'peace', 'live', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'Anwar', 'Sadat', '.The', 'story', 'good', 'pacing', 'much', 'done', 'flash-back', 'form', 'part', 'done', 'narrative', 'device', 'one', 'Golda', 'political', 'secretaries', 'Lou', 'Kaddar', 'played', 'Anne', 'Jackson', 'loved', 'scene', 'where', 'Lou', 'Kaddar', 'interviews', 'job', 'Golda', 'letter', 'sample', 'writing', 'letter', 'praise', 'former', 'employer', 'outstanding', 'man', 'Golda', 'Lou', 'Kaddar', 'was', 'son', '*bleep*', 'Golda', 'missing', 'beat', 'simply', 'replies', 'might', 'do', 'well', 'job', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'coming', 'wait']",N/A
1227275,A1G9FX1KV45N41,B001PKHS72,Gary Selikow,"[0, 0]","A remarkable , highly educational, absorbing and moving docudrama about one of the greatest women of the 20th century, a woman who embodied the ideals , dreams, fears, and stamina of the Jewish people of her time.The movie begins when Gold Meir (played in such a sterling way by Ingrid Bergman that we really believe she is Golda while watching), visits her old school in Milwaukee in 1977 and addresses the students. She described with great, charm, wit and empathy her life and we are transported back to Golda's childhood in Russia, where she huddles with her sister when the shtetl where they live is besieged by a violent pogrom which is out to murder Jews believing the Jews killed Jesus (as today the enemies of the Jews are out to destroy us under the lie that we 'stole the Palestinians land.Then we discover how she later in America marries Morris Myerson (played by Leonard Nimoy-and who could fail to recognize him as  Spock) and emigrates to Palestine, fulfilling Golda's lifelong dream ,  their early struggles in the Holy Land from life on a kibbutz, to Golda's work in the Hisdatrut trade union movement. And the collapse of Golda'a marriage due to her unavailability for her family.We are observe the proclamation of the State of Israel, the violent Arab reaction and are privy to Golda's visit to Amman to try persuade King Abdullah to keep Transjordan out of the war, and is told by the king that if peace was negotiated between them Ben-Gurion would be hailed by his people as great hero, and Abdullah would be murdered by his own people (as he was by an Arab terrorist four years later). Moving moments such as when Golda weeps when she meets Jewish children in Cyprus-who grew up in Nazi concentration camps, who had never seen flowers in their lives! And her anger at the Soviets granting Arab armies vast quantities  of the most technologically advanced and best weaponry they had free of charge.A really compelling and inspiring look at Israel and this great woman, relevant now more than ever, at  a time when so much of the world is swallowing the evil and venomous Arab propaganda.As we follow Golda's political career  as Foreign Minister including her sterling work in Africa, the way in which Israel was forced into the Six Day War (starting with Syria's murderous attacks on Israeli villages in northern Israel, and Nasser's troop movements as with that of the armies of Iraq and Jordan, as well as the violent threats made by the Arabs of genocide.But we also see how Golda refused to let her diagnosis with lymphoma in the early 1960s stop her from playing her role in history and the destiny of her nation. And her surprise at being asked to become Prime Minister in 1969.Explains her role in the Yom Kippur War, why she failed to order a preemptive strike when it was clear the Arab armies were attacking Israel just before the Yom Kippur War. and the public anger in Israel at Golda and Moshe Dayan who many blamed for the war. Golda throughout demonstrated her strong longing  for peace and that of all of Israel, with Israel's repeated pleas for peaceful coexistence with the Arab world. It is to the audience of the school at Milwaukee who she tells in this movie 'Peace will come when the Arabs love their own children more than they hate us'.It ends with Golda's meeting with Anwar Sadat during his visit to Jerusalem in 1978, where she asks Sadat why he took so long to come. My only quibble with the movie takes place here where at the press conference it is Golda who appears next to Sadat as the main speaker when in reality it was the then Prime Minister Menachem Begin.A compelling look at the life of one of the greatest Jewish women ever and also affirms the extraordinary spirit of the people of Israel,the most humane, giving, life-affirming people on the planet--whatever sick propaganda you might have read to the contrary.",5,"Remarkable , highly educational, absorbing and moving",1379203200,"09 15, 2013",2013,3877,"['remarkable', 'highly', 'educational', 'absorbing', 'moving', 'docudrama', 'one', 'greatest', 'women', '20th', 'century', 'woman', 'who', 'embodied', 'ideals', 'dreams', 'fears', 'stamina', 'Jewish', 'people', 'time.The', 'movie', 'when', 'Gold', 'Meir', 'played', 'such', 'sterling', 'way', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'really', 'believe', 'Golda', 'watching', 'old', 'school', 'Milwaukee', '1977', 'students', 'described', 'great', 'charm', 'wit', 'empathy', 'life', 'are', 'transported', 'back', 'Golda', 'childhood', 'Russia', 'where', 'sister', 'when', 'shtetl', 'where', 'live', 'besieged', 'violent', 'pogrom', 'out', 'murder', 'Jews', 'believing', 'Jews', 'killed', 'Jesus', 'today', 'enemies', 'Jews', 'are', 'destroy', 'lie', ""'stole"", 'Palestinians', 'land.Then', 'discover', 'how', 'later', 'America', 'marries', 'Morris', 'Myerson', 'played', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy-and', 'who', 'could', 'fail', 'recognize', 'Spock', 'Palestine', 'fulfilling', 'Golda', 'lifelong', 'dream', 'early', 'struggles', 'Holy', 'Land', 'life', 'kibbutz', 'Golda', 'work', 'Hisdatrut', 'trade', 'union', 'movement', 'collapse', 'Golda', 'marriage', 'due', 'unavailability', 'family.We', 'are', 'proclamation', 'State', 'Israel', 'violent', 'Arab', 'reaction', 'are', 'privy', 'Golda', 'visit', 'Amman', 'try', 'persuade', 'King', 'Abdullah', 'keep', 'Transjordan', 'war', 'told', 'king', 'peace', 'was', 'negotiated', 'Ben-Gurion', 'would', 'be', 'hailed', 'people', 'great', 'hero', 'Abdullah', 'would', 'be', 'murdered', 'own', 'people', 'was', 'Arab', 'terrorist', 'four', 'years', 'later', 'Moving', 'moments', 'such', 'when', 'Golda', 'when', 'Jewish', 'children', 'Cyprus-who', 'grew', 'up', 'Nazi', 'concentration', 'camps', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'flowers', 'lives', 'anger', 'Soviets', 'granting', 'Arab', 'armies', 'vast', 'quantities', 'most', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'best', 'weaponry', 'had', 'free', 'charge.A', 'really', 'compelling', 'inspiring', 'look', 'Israel', 'great', 'woman', 'relevant', 'now', 'more', 'ever', 'time', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'world', 'swallowing', 'evil', 'venomous', 'Arab', 'propaganda.As', 'follow', 'Golda', 'political', 'career', 'Foreign', 'Minister', 'including', 'sterling', 'work', 'Africa', 'way', 'Israel', 'was', 'forced', 'Six', 'Day', 'War', 'starting', 'Syria', 'murderous', 'attacks', 'Israeli', 'villages', 'northern', 'Israel', 'Nasser', 'troop', 'movements', 'armies', 'Iraq', 'Jordan', 'as', 'well', 'violent', 'threats', 'made', 'Arabs', 'genocide.But', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'Golda', 'refused', 'let', 'diagnosis', 'lymphoma', 'early', '1960s', 'stop', 'her', 'playing', 'role', 'history', 'destiny', 'nation', 'surprise', 'being', 'asked', 'become', 'Prime', 'Minister', '1969.Explains', 'role', 'Yom', 'Kippur', 'War', 'why', 'failed', 'order', 'preemptive', 'strike', 'when', 'was', 'clear', 'Arab', 'armies', 'were', 'attacking', 'Israel', 'just', 'Yom', 'Kippur', 'War', 'public', 'anger', 'Israel', 'Golda', 'Moshe', 'Dayan', 'who', 'many', 'blamed', 'war', 'Golda', 'demonstrated', 'strong', 'longing', 'peace', 'Israel', 'Israel', 'repeated', 'pleas', 'peaceful', 'coexistence', 'Arab', 'world', 'audience', 'school', 'Milwaukee', 'who', 'movie', ""'Peace"", 'will', 'come', 'when', 'Arabs', 'love', 'own', 'children', 'more', 'hate', ""us'.It"", 'ends', 'Golda', 'meeting', 'Anwar', 'Sadat', 'visit', 'Jerusalem', '1978', 'where', 'Sadat', 'why', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'come', 'My', 'only', 'quibble', 'movie', 'place', 'here', 'where', 'press', 'conference', 'Golda', 'who', 'next', 'Sadat', 'main', 'speaker', 'when', 'reality', 'was', 'then', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Menachem', 'Begin.A', 'compelling', 'look', 'life', 'one', 'greatest', 'Jewish', 'women', 'ever', 'also', 'extraordinary', 'spirit', 'people', 'Israel', 'most', 'humane', 'giving', 'life-affirming', 'people', 'planet', 'sick', 'propaganda', 'might', 'have', 'read', 'contrary']",N/A

Out steps Golda Meir, the former Prime Minister of Israel and the most famous graduate of this school. Born a Russian Jew, she and her family were forced to leave Russia in the early 20th century and emigrated to the US. Golda's dream became to live in Israel. As she answers questions from the school children she flashes back to her life and the events that led to her being the Prime Minister of Israel and one of the most influential women of the 20th century. Ingrid Bergman is outstanding as always and was a great choice to play the part of Golda Meir. This is not only the story of an incredible and influential woman but it is the story of Israel, its journey to statehood and its fight to survive in the midst of its enemies. It's a great biography and an excellent history lesson. It makes one wonder what it would be like now if there were a woman of her stature in Israeli leadership.
