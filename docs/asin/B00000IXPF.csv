505187,A2F89BTWLSEEKF,B00000IXPF,Edward M. Erdelac,"[5, 12]","Alright, first let me say I enjoyed this for what it was - a Tv movie.  I liked the concept and the message enjoyed the overall execution, but a couple things really bothered me...1. `Doc' John Holliday was a dentist, not a medical doctor.2. Why did the gunfight at the end take place, when it was already depicted that the Higher Power would protect the town's citizens so long as they didn't resort to violence (remember when Sam Sheppard stands in front of the church door to stop the baddies from tossing their bowie knives?)?  And how could the citizens be harmed by the bad guys anyway, considering their true nature?3.  So Purgatory is located just south of Sweetwater, Texas?  How could Ric Roberts and his gang ride into this place, and why didn't the posse follow them in?  Its hard to believe such a huge gang could give the lawmen the slip and not leave a clear trail for them to follow.4. Why would such a formidable (and large) gang of bank robbers put all the money they'd just swiped on one horse?Overall, as I said, I enjoyed this.  The actors all do a good job -particularly Eric Roberts, who was the biggest misgiving I had going into this.  He came off completely believable and seductively bad (which was good).  Donnie Wahlberg does a lot with the little screen time he's given, as does Randy Quaid and the fella who plays `JJ' (the storekeeper).  Sam Sheppard doesn't look a whit like who he's supposed to be portraying, but it didn't bother me.I like the notion that `The marginally good' are given a chance to separated from `the totally wicked,' and I like the supernatural theme of redemption.  I thought the passage of the bad guys through the ghostly gates was very Twilight Zonish, and eerie, but I wish they hadn't shown us what was beyond all that smoke.  It kind've ruined the effect.Overall, a good effort, worth renting, but I don't know about putting it up as one of the greatest westerns of all time.If you wanna see a really stellar made-for-cable western, check out John Cusack, LQ Jones, and John Goodman in `The Jack Bull.'",3,"Rein In Your Horses, Now...",1064188800,"09 22, 2003",2003,2064,"['Alright', 'first', 'let', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'was', 'Tv', 'movie', 'liked', 'concept', 'message', 'enjoyed', 'overall', 'execution', 'couple', 'things', 'really', 'bothered', '1', 'Doc', 'John', 'Holliday', 'was', 'dentist', 'not', 'medical', 'doctor.2', 'Why', 'did', 'gunfight', 'end', 'take', 'place', 'when', 'was', 'already', 'depicted', 'Higher', 'Power', 'would', 'protect', 'town', 'citizens', 'so', 'long', 'did', ""n't"", 'resort', 'violence', 'remember', 'when', 'Sam', 'Sheppard', 'front', 'church', 'door', 'stop', 'baddies', 'tossing', 'bowie', 'knives', 'how', 'could', 'citizens', 'be', 'harmed', 'bad', 'guys', 'anyway', 'considering', 'true', 'nature', '3', 'So', 'Purgatory', 'located', 'just', 'south', 'Sweetwater', 'Texas', 'How', 'could', 'Ric', 'Roberts', 'gang', 'ride', 'place', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'posse', 'follow', 'hard', 'believe', 'huge', 'gang', 'could', 'give', 'lawmen', 'slip', 'not', 'leave', 'clear', 'trail', 'follow.4', 'Why', 'would', 'such', 'formidable', 'large', 'gang', 'bank', 'robbers', 'put', 'money', ""'d"", 'just', 'swiped', 'one', 'horse', 'Overall', 'said', 'enjoyed', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', '-particularly', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'who', 'was', 'biggest', 'misgiving', 'had', 'going', 'came', 'off', 'completely', 'believable', 'seductively', 'bad', 'was', 'good', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'lot', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'given', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'fella', 'who', 'JJ', 'storekeeper', 'Sam', 'Sheppard', ""n't"", 'look', 'whit', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'portraying', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'me.I', 'notion', 'marginally', 'good', 'are', 'given', 'chance', 'separated', 'totally', 'wicked', 'like', 'supernatural', 'theme', 'redemption', 'thought', 'passage', 'bad', 'guys', 'ghostly', 'was', 'very', 'Twilight', 'Zonish', 'eerie', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'shown', 'was', 'smoke', 'kind', ""'ve"", 'ruined', 'effect.Overall', 'good', 'effort', 'worth', 'renting', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'putting', 'up', 'one', 'greatest', 'westerns', 'time.If', 'wan', 'see', 'really', 'stellar', 'made-for-cable', 'western', 'check', 'out', 'John', 'Cusack', 'LQ', 'Jones', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Jack', 'Bull']",Purgatory VHS

505194,A32CG0V371FRQ2,B00000IXPF,GratedTopping,"[1, 5]","I don't care about westerns and, when I found this on videotape and it was just a dollar or so, I wanted to try it out based on the mystical nature it described.Outlaws, fleeing the law with money they stole from a robbery, come upon the the town of Refuge. That turns out to be a haven on the 'other side' where souls are waiting. Classic legends of the Old West are found there (like Billy the Kid and Doc Holliday). They want to redeem themselves for their actions while they were alive, so there's no cursing....fighting...etc. However, the town still has a saloon and one can get drunk. As well, there are guns and ammo (as we learn later) and it seems stupid that things that could tempt them to resort to their old ways, like in real-life, would be present.The outlaws realize how nobody -- not even the sheriff -- carries a weapon and there's no jail. So, the town's easy for the pickin'. Eventually, when the entire town is in danger of destruction and bloodshed, the former gunslingers decide to defend themselves and the rest of the folks...knowing that it's going to mean they 'fail' and will be lost for eternity.If it's a place for souls to be until they are ready for heaven (or hell if they 'fail'), there's no way that regular-folks should be there. The gang of desperados couldn't appear. That's something that will always be wrong with the story. I figured at the beginning that the gang was all dead when they came upon the town of Refuge and didn't realize it. It was what I thought because of the name of the movie + the town looked a bit eerie and the leader of the gang spoke of how they made a wrong turn or the wind made them get sidetracked (whatever).So....the spirits of the famous gunslingers of the Old West take charge to defend their town from the living desperados. By doing so, an knowing what it means, they 'failed' and are to be taken to hell by an Indian spirit/man. However, before this, an old man in stagecoach comes at the last moment and tells them something like ""The Creator may be strict, but He ain't blind."" Thus, the four gunslingers get a reprieve, get into the stagecoach, and are taken down the road to heaven. The end. What did they all really do that was good? In their final actions, they killed humans that were somehow in the spirit realm and that's what they needed to do to 'earn' heaven? There's nothing we can do to earn heaven. The Creator said so; many of us are blind or deaf to understanding that. I guess we're supposed to think that because the gunslingers were protecting others and using their weapons to selflessly help instead of harm, unlike when they were alive, was enough.Oh...and how about Sonny? He's one member of the gang who's pretty innocent and new to the group. He shoots & kills one of the men on horseback who shot him at the same time. Instantly, he spoke of how he's not in any pain and the sheriff welcomes him to Refuge. Sonny just died. Now later, at the stagecoach, he's invited to come aboard as well. Apparently, this was because he was the first one standing up to the desperados and protected the woman (spirit) he said he loved (though he didn't even know her) from gunfire. It's not clear to me, but I think that's the reason. He told the woman earlier that he killed one man who asked him to do it (we witness this happening earlier in the movie) and the second man he killed was the one who would have killed (???) the woman/spirit. So, both of Sonny's executions weren't acts done in revenge. He ends up choosing to remain in the town with the woman and becoming the new sheriff, knowing that -- according to the stagecoach driver -- he can leave when he wants.VARIOUS OTHER THOUGHTS:- When chiding the man about saying ""da*n"", I figure the sheriff shouldn't have repeated it. ""You said 'da*n' ... twice!"" To me, it would have been keeping in the character of the sheriff at the time if he said ""You said the d-word ... twice!"" This sheriff's time was almost up in Refuge.- The residents of Refuge, since they aren't living-beings, couldn't be harmed by the humans. Before the final shootout, one mentions how if they fight, they lose (because it would mean they will be banished)...if they do nothing they lose (die? again?). If everyone there was a spirit, however, there'd be no flick. A western with all the bullets passing right through everyone?- Why would the residents all go by different names? Who would care? They know who they are. There's to be no swearing in the town. The fact that they lie about who they are, well, that should be on the 'naughty list' too.- When Sonny shoots and kills the man on the horse, why does the body just lie there? The dude's spirit should then be there -- just like with Sonny. He dies right away from that same man's shots and he doesn't fall, saying that he's not in any pain. Also, what about when the sheriff kills the leader ""Black Jack""? His spirit should then have appeared, too.Yes, this is meant to be a western and a supernatural-type of film, obviously not meant to be taken seriously, but I want to mention that I believe the concept of purgatory is unscriptural. It implies that the death and resurrection of Jesus was not enough. To say such a thing and believe that we'll still need to be in a place of purification before heaven is insulting to why the Father sent Jesus here. Jesus' sinless life, sacrificial death for us, and resurrection is what was required to make is possible for any man to get right with God. ""It is finished.""This is a silly flick and yet I found it okay to pass the time with. I liked most of the acting, especially the sheriff's; it moves rather-briskly; and I wasn't bored.

This is a lovely film, surprisingly (and refreshingly) free of the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink-and-we-may-have-that-too motifs of sex, blood, more sex, more blood, lots of the &quot;F&quot; word, more sex, lots more blood, and (just for something different) bloody sex with lots of the &quot;F&quot; word.  I was stunned that the writers and producers managed to churn out a flick that was entertaining, comfortably familiar  and just a little unpredictable. You could share this movie with your kids, your Mom and Dad  and your aunt the Nun and not squirm with embarrassment. (Intelligent grown-up movies that you can watch with your kids!  What a clever concept!) I was reaching for kleenex during the last twenty minutes.  How nice to see that it is still considered courageous when someone chooses to make a tough, personally detrimental sacrifice in order to preserve the greater good. People here have been calling this a &quot;sci-fi&quot; film, but I think the classification is more &quot;religious fantasy with western overtones.&quot;  Whatever the case, if you like westerns, if you like the pitting of good against evil, if you are sick of the blood, gore, swearing and sex that pass for action entertainment these days...and if you believe in something greater than yourself, then by all means, you should be watching &quot;Purgatory.&quot;",5,A Pleasant Surprise and Not What I Expected,985651200,"03 27, 2001",2001,1542,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'ghost', 'stories', 'had', 'been', 'expecting', 'hoping', 'something', 'eerier', 'outlaw', 'gang', 'got', 'Refuge', 'however', 'expectations', 'hopes', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'important', 'lovely', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'refreshingly', 'free', 'everything-but-the-kitchen-sink-and-we-may-have-that-too', 'motifs', 'sex', 'blood', 'more', 'sex', 'more', 'blood', 'lots', 'quot', 'F', 'quot', 'word', 'more', 'sex', 'lots', 'more', 'blood', 'just', 'something', 'different', 'bloody', 'sex', 'lots', 'quot', 'F', 'quot', 'word', 'was', 'stunned', 'writers', 'producers', 'managed', 'churn', 'out', 'flick', 'was', 'entertaining', 'comfortably', 'familiar', 'just', 'little', 'unpredictable', 'could', 'share', 'movie', 'kids', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'aunt', 'Nun', 'not', 'squirm', 'embarrassment', 'Intelligent', 'grown-up', 'movies', 'can', 'watch', 'kids', 'What', 'clever', 'concept', 'was', 'reaching', 'kleenex', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'How', 'nice', 'see', 'still', 'considered', 'courageous', 'when', 'someone', 'make', 'tough', 'personally', 'detrimental', 'sacrifice', 'order', 'preserve', 'greater', 'good', 'People', 'here', 'have', 'been', 'calling', 'quot', 'sci-fi', 'quot', 'film', 'think', 'classification', 'more', 'quot', 'religious', 'fantasy', 'western', 'overtones.', 'quot', 'case', 'like', 'westerns', 'like', 'pitting', 'good', 'evil', 'are', 'sick', 'blood', 'gore', 'swearing', 'sex', 'pass', 'action', 'entertainment', 'days', 'believe', 'something', 'greater', 'then', 'means', 'should', 'be', 'watching', 'quot', 'Purgatory.', 'quot']",Purgatory VHS

505204,A8F2AZWB20X1H,B00000IXPF,JLind555,"[3, 3]","I caught this movie on TV last night after a hiatus of several years.  It was a made-for-TV film run on TNT, and should be shown a lot more often.  It could have stood on its own as a feature in any theater as a great piece of movie making.A gang of outlaws headed by the notorious Blackjack Britton lams out of town after a bank robbery and gets lost in a dust storm with the posse on their trail.  They take a wrong turn, evading the posse, and come upon a spooky little place with a gated entrance guarded by an ancient Indian, who turns out to be keeping more than one gate.  Was it luck or fate that brought them here?  The townspeople all seem peculiarly docile.  The sheriff wears a badge but not a gun.  And Sonny, the youngest of the outlaw band and addicted to dime western novels, not an outlaw himself but who went along for the ride with his uncle, one of the gang members, realizes that the sheriff is a dead ringer for Wild Bill Hickock and the sheriff's friends look exactly like Doc Holliday, Billy the Kid, Jesse James and Lefty Slade, all dead for years.  In fact, that's just who they turn out to be, and the town, called Refuge, is nowhere on earth, but is actually Purgatory, a mid-world created for people who are neither good enough to be admitted to Heaven nor bad enough to be condemned to Hell.  Purgatory is their last chance to set themselves right before their final sentencing.  But as the sheriff tells Sonny, Refuge is a place of hard rules: no cussing, no fighting, no rioting, no stealing, no violent outbursts no matter what the provocation -- and one of the sheriff's friends finds out tragically just what the penalty for breaking those rules is.Blackjack Britton and his gang see Refuge as a place to cut loose and raise all kinds of mayhem, and for a while the sheriff tries to deal with the situation through polite admonitions.  But the sheriff and his friends realize that some evil is too entrenched to be dealt with by patience and docility, and sometimes one must resort to extreme measures, if not for his own benefit, then for the good of the people he must protect.  And who knows, maybe at times giving evil people a taste of their own medicine is justified.  As a wily old stagecoach driver observes, ""The Creator may be tough, but He ain't blind.""Uli Edel's direction and Gordon T. Dawson's script lift the movie beyond what might have been a banal western into the truly sublime, helped by a superb cast that includes Sam Shepard as Wild Bill Hickock, Eric Roberts in what may be his finest performance as Blackjack Britton, Randy Quaid as Doc Holliday, Donnie Wahlberg as Billy the Kid, J.D. Souther as Jesse James, Brad Rowe as Sonny, and Peter Stormare as Blackjack's henchman and Sonny's evil uncle Cavin Guthrie.  It's a perfect little gem of a western, of the kind they don't make any more, with the added treat of a tender love story running through it all.Judy Lind",5,Great little western from straight out of the Twilight Zone,1252886400,"09 14, 2009",2009,2926,"['caught', 'movie', 'TV', 'last', 'night', 'hiatus', 'several', 'years', 'was', 'made-for-TV', 'film', 'run', 'TNT', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'lot', 'more', 'often', 'could', 'have', 'stood', 'own', 'feature', 'theater', 'great', 'piece', 'movie', 'making.A', 'gang', 'outlaws', 'headed', 'notorious', 'Blackjack', 'Britton', 'town', 'bank', 'robbery', 'lost', 'dust', 'storm', 'posse', 'trail', 'take', 'wrong', 'turn', 'evading', 'posse', 'come', 'spooky', 'little', 'place', 'gated', 'entrance', 'guarded', 'ancient', 'Indian', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'keeping', 'more', 'one', 'gate', 'Was', 'fate', 'brought', 'here', 'townspeople', 'seem', 'peculiarly', 'docile', 'sheriff', 'badge', 'not', 'gun', 'Sonny', 'youngest', 'outlaw', 'band', 'addicted', 'dime', 'western', 'novels', 'not', 'outlaw', 'who', 'went', 'along', 'ride', 'uncle', 'one', 'gang', 'members', 'sheriff', 'dead', 'ringer', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Hickock', 'sheriff', 'friends', 'look', 'exactly', 'Doc', 'Holliday', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Lefty', 'Slade', 'dead', 'years', 'fact', 'just', 'who', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'town', 'called', 'Refuge', 'nowhere', 'earth', 'actually', 'Purgatory', 'mid-world', 'created', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'admitted', 'Heaven', 'bad', 'enough', 'be', 'condemned', 'Hell', 'Purgatory', 'last', 'chance', 'set', 'right', 'final', 'sentencing', 'sheriff', 'Sonny', 'Refuge', 'place', 'hard', 'rules', 'cussing', 'fighting', 'rioting', 'stealing', 'violent', 'matter', 'what', 'provocation', 'one', 'sheriff', 'friends', 'out', 'tragically', 'just', 'what', 'penalty', 'breaking', 'rules', 'is.Blackjack', 'Britton', 'gang', 'see', 'Refuge', 'place', 'cut', 'loose', 'raise', 'kinds', 'mayhem', 'sheriff', 'tries', 'deal', 'situation', 'polite', 'admonitions', 'sheriff', 'friends', 'realize', 'evil', 'too', 'entrenched', 'be', 'dealt', 'patience', 'docility', 'sometimes', 'one', 'must', 'resort', 'extreme', 'measures', 'not', 'own', 'benefit', 'then', 'good', 'people', 'must', 'protect', 'who', 'maybe', 'times', 'giving', 'evil', 'people', 'taste', 'own', 'medicine', 'justified', 'wily', 'old', 'stagecoach', 'driver', 'Creator', 'may', 'be', 'tough', 'ai', ""n't"", 'blind', 'Uli', 'Edel', 'direction', 'Gordon', 'T.', 'Dawson', 'script', 'movie', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'banal', 'western', 'truly', 'sublime', 'helped', 'superb', 'cast', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Hickock', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'finest', 'performance', 'Blackjack', 'Britton', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'Doc', 'Holliday', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'J.D', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Brad', 'Rowe', 'Sonny', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'Blackjack', 'henchman', 'Sonny', 'evil', 'uncle', 'Cavin', 'Guthrie', 'perfect', 'little', 'gem', 'western', 'kind', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'more', 'added', 'treat', 'tender', 'love', 'story', 'running', 'Lind']",Purgatory VHS

Munyon,"[1, 6]","I bought this DVD - (1) because I wanted to see how purgatory would be folded into the western genre of film making; (2) because I recognized the names Eric Roberts, Sam Shepard, Randy Quaid, and Amelia Heinle; (3) because it is ""not rated"" which leaves room for violence, terror, and nudity without apology; and (4) most westerns have the people killed who deserve it.What I got by owning and viewing this DVD - (1) hell is a ditch where somebody is burning weeds, heaven is a stagecoach, and the gate keeper is a Native American Indian; (2) to move from purgatory to heaven you can't smoke, drink, cuss, or chew, or go with girls that do - and you can't carry a gun because you can't kill anybody (well okay . . . unless they REALLY, REALLY deserve it); (3) ""not rated"" means it was on TV so it's about as milquetoast as you're ever going to find in any western of any vintage all the way back past Tom Mix (violence, terror, or nudity? don't make me laugh); and (4) by the time the movie finally gets around to the gunfight, I didn't care if everybody died, as long as the movie was over.The movie sets up the pretense of Blackjack Britton (Eric Roberts) being a vile, nasty and deserving of death outlaw early, which made me want Jack Palance to show up, pull out a Crocodile Dundee blade and slit the bad guy neck to nuts.  Spoiler alert - Jack Palance does not appear in this film.  Instead, ""Purgatory"" delivers Wild Bill Hickock, Doc Holliday, and Billy the Kid; not even carrying a gun, let alone willing to do anything whatsoever toward putting the town of Refuge back to safety and justice by dealing with Blackjack Britton - one way or another.  Nothing . . . . until finally there is a short gunfight, at the end of the movie.  Some are led by the Native American Indian to the ditch of burning weeds, some go to the stagecoach.

This is a made for TV movie but do not let that discourage you from seeing this unusual and unique western DVD.  This film begins with a bank robbery by a vicious group of very bad characters.  They end up in a shoot-out and ride out of town chased by the law.  They end up losing the money but most of the gang gets away from the law men.  As they are riding in any unknown area  they enter a fog and end up in a small peaceful western town called &#34;Refuge.&#34;  Strangely, the gang is greeted by the sheriff, who is unarmed and extends a welcome to the group.  This is where the story becomes interesting and mysterious.I never give away too much when reviewing a book or movie, which will spoil it for those who want to see this movie.  I will say that most of the top gunfighters of the old west (Wild Bill Hickok, Doc Holiday, Jessie James and Billy the kid) are in this movie.  Like all good movies this one has all the ingredients of a unique and imaginative action packed western.

In any event, having loved ""SOHWOH"", I spent a good bit of my time while watching ""Purgatory"" trying to decide 'who copied who'.  ""Purgatory"" was released first (1999/2000), but my understanding was that Dwight had ""SOHWOH"" in his pocket for a good while before getting it made....so the question that was distracting me was not something I am going to be able to answer....but, I did reaize I was on the 'right track' when late in ""Purgatory"" I heard the gutteral utterings of 'Come On....', talk about paying homage.Anyway, Purgtory had a great cast, but they all seriously underplayed their roles a bit.  I mean afterall, these were supposed to THE personalities of the old west; but they were certainly an understated group of BAD GUYS.  Given the subject matter, the film was certainly easy to understand (not a trademark of ""SOHWOH"" I might add), but that sort of made ""Purgatory"" come off as a bit of an 'immature film'.  I mean shouldn't something this fanciful be a bit theatrical?  The actors seemed to be portraying zombies rather than individuals still striving to get their journey 'to the light' completeted in a positive manner.  In order words, maybe the reason the film was so easily understandable was that the viewer had no trouble knowing the characters were dead....because they acted that part perfectly.Watching ""Purgatory"" was an okay way to spend a Friday night at home.  Not too much stress on the gray matter, nothing exciting enough to get the keep you from relaxing after a week of hard work, and just enough story to keep you interested, even if it is only to consider the question of which came first ""Purgatory"" or ""SOHWOH"".My conclusion:  If you disliked Dwight's tale, you will probably like ""Purgatory"" - and vice versa.",3,Reminded me of 'South of Heaven West of Hell,1311984000,"07 30, 2011",2011,1920,"['bit', 'more', 'coherent', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'personal', 'offering', 'perhaps', 'am', 'not', 'sure', ""'logical"", 'good', 'thing', 'when', 'subject', 'Western', 'set', 'afterlife', 'event', 'having', 'loved', 'SOHWOH', 'spent', 'good', 'bit', 'time', 'watching', 'Purgatory', 'trying', 'decide', ""'who"", 'copied', 'who', 'Purgatory', 'was', 'released', 'first', '1999/2000', 'understanding', 'was', 'Dwight', 'had', 'SOHWOH', 'pocket', 'good', 'while', 'getting', 'made', '.so', 'question', 'was', 'distracting', 'was', 'not', 'something', 'am', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'answer', '.but', 'did', 'reaize', 'was', ""'right"", 'track', 'when', 'late', 'Purgatory', 'heard', 'gutteral', 'utterings', ""'Come"", 'talk', 'paying', 'homage.Anyway', 'Purgtory', 'had', 'great', 'cast', 'seriously', 'underplayed', 'roles', 'bit', 'mean', 'afterall', 'were', 'supposed', 'THE', 'personalities', 'old', 'west', 'were', 'certainly', 'understated', 'group', 'BAD', 'GUYS', 'Given', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'was', 'certainly', 'easy', 'understand', 'not', 'trademark', 'SOHWOH', 'might', 'add', 'sort', 'made', 'Purgatory', 'come', 'off', 'bit', ""'immature"", 'film', 'mean', 'should', ""n't"", 'something', 'fanciful', 'be', 'bit', 'theatrical', 'actors', 'seemed', 'be', 'portraying', 'zombies', 'rather', 'individuals', 'still', 'striving', 'get', 'journey', 'light', 'completeted', 'positive', 'manner', 'order', 'words', 'maybe', 'reason', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'easily', 'understandable', 'was', 'viewer', 'had', 'trouble', 'knowing', 'characters', 'were', 'dead', 'acted', 'part', 'perfectly.Watching', 'Purgatory', 'was', 'okay', 'way', 'spend', 'Friday', 'night', 'home', 'Not', 'too', 'much', 'stress', 'gray', 'matter', 'nothing', 'exciting', 'enough', 'get', 'keep', 'relaxing', 'week', 'hard', 'work', 'just', 'enough', 'story', 'keep', 'interested', 'even', 'only', 'consider', 'question', 'came', 'first', 'Purgatory', 'SOHWOH', '.My', 'conclusion', 'disliked', 'Dwight', 'tale', 'will', 'probably', 'Purgatory', 'vice', 'versa']",Purgatory VHS

Boy am I glad I gave the housework a miss! What an excellent film!  It wasn't just a western but it was a love story, a mystery, a thriller, a bit of horror and lots of good quality acting. The storyline was fairly simple. A group of rowdy cowboys come across a small town called Refuge and they think that their luck is in.  It's run by a Sheriff who doesn't tote a gun, and the locals are wary of trouble to the point of paranoia.  Enter Sonny portrayed by the delicious young Brad Rowe as an idealistic young cowboy who is the first to realise that the town of Refuge isn't quite what it seems.  There are familiar faces in the town, faces that have been dead for many years and they're all pretending to be people that they aren't.  Sonny goes looking for the truth and in doing so falls in love with Rose a Refuge local played by newcomer Amelia Heinle.  In order to save Rose from the outlaws he has been travelling with Sonny must take on a band of vicious men, and make Wild Bill Hickok, Sam Shepherd at his best, pick up his guns once more even though it means a fate worse than death for him.  This is a great film, with a great storyline that is made even better by a strong cast of actors.  Look out for Donnie Wahlberg who plays Deputy Glen/Billy The Kid, he's an absolute cutie-pie!  It's not too graphic in the horror department so those who are squeamish can watch it without too much hiding behind pillows, and it has enough suspense for those who want a film with a little bit of a bite here and there.

I swear I saw this movie a year or two before then. Also, this movie is a TNT original, and I don't think it was ever in the theaters. But let me clarify, it could have done very well at theaters. This movie does not come across as 'made for television'. In fact, it is better than 95% of the movies currently on the big screen. I should state that, like many others here, I am not a big fan of westerns, and movies with religious undercurrents generally turn me right off. Thus, when my girlfriend wanted to watch this when it was first shown on TNT one night, I was not too excited by the idea. About 15 minutes into the film, my mind was totally changed and I was absolutely riveted to the screen. I was stunned by the subtle-but-immediate effect this movie was having on me. If my house would have started on fire, I don't think I'd have noticed.This movie is pretty much impossible to categorize. It looks and feels like a western, but it's not. It also feels a bit like sci-fi, but it's not. Its message is deep and profound, but easy to understand instinctively. I've seen hundreds of movies, but I've never seen casting done this well before. All characters come across beautifully. This is not a huge-budget movie, Hollywood style, but you'll never notice the difference. I'm sure a large amount of money was spent, but this movie makes it due to stellar storytelling, great acting and wonderful direction, not big special effects.

This film just carries it to a higher plane.I like the concept of men who walked the razor edge between Good and Bad being allowed one more chance to toe the line. There's alot about the character of Bill Hickok, Jesse James, Doc Holliday, and Billy the Kid that is not black and white- there's alot of gray.But, what happens when outside evil comes to Purgatory and you've sworn off violence forever?

How?  By becoming residents of a town called Refuge.  By becoming pacifists.  By resisting the things that their former lives were built around.  In short, by being good.

After a bloody bank robbery, they happen upon Refuge as they flee a posse formed to apprehend them.  They'd have been better off caught.At first thought they believe they have found the perfect hideout.  but as time goes on they begin to expect other forces than simple fate are at work here.

They are given some hints as to the nature of the town, like when one of them throws a knife at the sheriff in an attempt to kill him, but is struck by lightening  just as he is launching the throw.  Despite the hints the gang decides to assault the town and take whatever entertainment and loot they can.The confrontation between the violent outlaws and peaceful citizens of Refuge is impressive.  The incidents after the battle teach the audience  about end of life activities and standards for avoiding Hell and obtaining Heaven.I enjoyed Purgatory.

When I finished watching it one of my friends told me it was made for TV. I almost couldn't beleive him because I have never seen a movie that was made for TV that was as good as this was.  And to top it off I'm not even that fond of western movies. The only western movie I've ever really liked was Tombstone.
