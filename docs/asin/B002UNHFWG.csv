1290026,A303DSLSUYUG42,B002UNHFWG,Jane Adams,"[20, 22]","Okay, I loved this movie there is only one thing I don't like about it. In the movie they said if they got divorced they could not be remarried because she could not be yoked with an unbeliever. At one time I would have agreed with that, except for our church did a series on divorce that made me think differently. You see, yes the bible says not to be yoked with an unbeliever and if they had never been married to each other before I would say she shouldn't marry him, but based on this scripture Matt 19:3 ""And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, ""Is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause?"" 4 He answered, ""Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, 5 and said, `Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'? 6 So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate."" 7 They said to him, ""Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?"" 8 He said to them, ""Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. 9 And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery."" Now if you are divorced how can you commit adultery, I believe the answer is because moses allowed for divorce because of the hardness of hearts, but God doesn't allow for divorce. I believe once you are one, you are always one in God's eyes. God hates divorce weather or not you are a believer when it happened and the reason remarrying another is adultery (unfaithfulness) is because you are cheating on your true spouse. Also in 1 Corinthians 7:10-11 it says "" To the married I give this charge (not I, but the Lord): the wife should not separate from her husband (but if she does, she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband), and the husband should not divorce his wife."" If she divorces her husband she should be reconciled or reunited in some translations. My pastor who is also a professor at Moody says we should never take his word for it, but always check the scriptures. I loved this movie, I'm even going to buy it, but I feel that they misinterpreted scripture. I know a lot of people believe this, but I don't think it is right that if they were divorced, they could not reconcile because she is a believer now and he's not. The reason I even bother to write this is because if someone is out there that wants to be reconciled to their spouse who is not a believer and they are, or the other way around, I believe God would want you to be reconciled, I don't think you are divorced in His eyes. Now I could be wrong, but I strongly believe that is a correct interpretation. Don't take someone's word for it, even mine, study for yourself and pray.",4,I just don't agree scripturally with one thing,1268438400,"03 13, 2010",2010,2901,"['Okay', 'loved', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'said', 'got', 'divorced', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'remarried', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'yoked', 'unbeliever', 'one', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'agreed', 'church', 'did', 'series', 'divorce', 'made', 'think', 'differently', 'see', 'yes', 'bible', 'not', 'be', 'yoked', 'unbeliever', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'married', 'other', 'would', 'say', 'should', ""n't"", 'marry', 'based', 'scripture', 'Matt', '19:3', 'Pharisees', 'came', 'up', 'tested', 'asking', 'lawful', 'divorce', 'one', 'wife', 'cause', '4', 'answered', 'Have', 'not', 'read', 'who', 'created', 'beginning', 'made', 'male', 'female', '5', 'said', 'Therefore', 'man', 'shall', 'leave', 'father', 'mother', 'hold', 'fast', 'wife', 'two', 'shall', 'become', 'one', 'flesh', '6', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'two', 'one', 'flesh', 'What', 'God', 'joined', 'together', 'let', 'not', 'man', 'separate', '7', 'said', 'Why', 'then', 'did', 'Moses', 'command', 'one', 'give', 'certificate', 'divorce', 'send', 'away', '8', 'said', 'hardness', 'heart', 'Moses', 'allowed', 'divorce', 'wives', 'beginning', 'was', 'not', 'so', '9', 'say', 'whoever', 'wife', 'sexual', 'immorality', 'marries', 'adultery', 'Now', 'are', 'divorced', 'how', 'can', 'commit', 'believe', 'answer', 'moses', 'allowed', 'divorce', 'hardness', 'hearts', 'God', ""n't"", 'allow', 'divorce', 'believe', 'are', 'one', 'are', 'always', 'one', 'God', 'eyes', 'God', 'divorce', 'weather', 'not', 'are', 'believer', 'when', 'happened', 'reason', 'remarrying', 'adultery', 'unfaithfulness', 'are', 'cheating', 'true', 'spouse', 'Also', '1', 'Corinthians', '7:10-11', 'married', 'give', 'charge', 'not', 'Lord', 'wife', 'should', 'not', 'separate', 'husband', 'should', 'remain', 'unmarried', 'else', 'be', 'reconciled', 'husband', 'husband', 'should', 'not', 'divorce', 'wife', 'husband', 'should', 'be', 'reconciled', 'reunited', 'translations', 'pastor', 'who', 'also', 'professor', 'Moody', 'should', 'never', 'take', 'word', 'always', 'check', 'scriptures', 'loved', 'movie', ""'m"", 'even', 'going', 'buy', 'feel', 'misinterpreted', 'scripture', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'believe', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'right', 'were', 'divorced', 'could', 'not', 'reconcile', 'believer', 'now', 'not', 'reason', 'even', 'bother', 'write', 'someone', 'out', 'there', 'be', 'reconciled', 'spouse', 'who', 'not', 'believer', 'are', 'other', 'way', 'believe', 'God', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'reconciled', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'divorced', 'eyes', 'Now', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'strongly', 'believe', 'correct', 'interpretation', 'Do', ""n't"", 'take', 'someone', 'word', 'even', 'mine', 'study', 'pray']",No Greater Love
1290027,A31SSLCKQ9U2XX,B002UNHFWG,"Jim4God ""Jim4God""","[6, 6]","I found the movie uplifting and encouraging.  I thought that it really showed the true power of love, and I felt that it covered the doctrine of divorce very well.  I think the movie was recorded very nicely, and it seemed like good quality film.  One thing I see from watching many christian films is that they are poorly recorded; however, most have a great message.  This film was really top notch.  I also enjoyed seeing stars from Disney in this movie like the guy who played in Not Quite Human and the teacher from Boy Meets World.  I think it was a moving film but not the best that I have seen.  However, my father did cry according to my mom which in itself is a miracle. lol.This is a spoiler comment upon the doctrine behind the movie so don't read if you really are interested in watching the movie.I see that some people had a problem with the way that the marriage was treated in this movie.  I believe it was handled right.  The pastor thought that the couple was divorced.  Now, one was saved, and one was lost.  The husband wanted the wife back, but the wife felt she could not go back because then she would be unequally yoked with a sinner.  I think this is pretty Biblical.  Once the pastor found out that the divorce never went through.  Then, he encouraged the husband and wife to stay together which is also Biblical.  As long as the unbelieving spouse will strive with the believing spouse, then they are supposed to stick together.  I don't really see what problem people are finding with this.  It is straight up scripture.  The pastor thought that they had both divorced when they were unbelievers so requirements on avoiding divorce did not apply to them as non-believers.  I just really don't see what people are fussing about.  If you need the scriptures, I can give them to you if you comment on my review.  I am very schooled on this subject since I had to go through a divorce a couple years back at the request of my ex-wife.  Since then, I have read book after book analyzing the scriptures on divorce.  I have even studied the scriptures in greek and hebrew.

1290031,A2FYTXWPUM4LG2,B002UNHFWG,katharos,"[2, 2]","This review contains spoilers. The basic story is good but the pastor's character made me want to wipe the smile off his face; it was really irritating. (It was interesting to me, though, that his wife was very sensitive and I think she always gave good counsel.) I can't imagine a pastor saying the things this man said while smiling like that, even if he believed what he said was right. However, what he said was scripturally incorrect. The writer of this film had some things correct but even if a person is divorced and then becomes a Christian, if their spouse is not remarried and is willing to be reconciled, the word from the Bible is to be reconciled. For a Christian there is no marrying somebody else while your spouse is still alive. (Romans 7 makes that very clear.) But the ending of the film makes its message good because the unbeliever realizes he needs and wants what his wife has.",4,"Mostly good but has some wrong ""doctrine""",1326412800,"01 13, 2012",2012,900,"['review', 'spoilers', 'basic', 'story', 'good', 'pastor', 'character', 'made', 'want', 'wipe', 'smile', 'face', 'was', 'really', 'irritating', 'was', 'interesting', 'though', 'wife', 'was', 'very', 'sensitive', 'think', 'always', 'gave', 'good', 'counsel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'pastor', 'saying', 'things', 'man', 'said', 'smiling', 'even', 'believed', 'what', 'said', 'was', 'right', 'However', 'what', 'said', 'was', 'scripturally', 'incorrect', 'writer', 'film', 'had', 'things', 'correct', 'even', 'person', 'divorced', 'then', 'Christian', 'spouse', 'not', 'remarried', 'willing', 'be', 'reconciled', 'word', 'Bible', 'be', 'reconciled', 'Christian', 'marrying', 'somebody', 'else', 'spouse', 'still', 'alive', 'Romans', '7', 'very', 'clear', 'ending', 'film', 'message', 'good', 'unbeliever', 'what', 'wife']",No Greater Love

1290033,A2KXF8S3KVK99J,B002UNHFWG,L. M. Jordan,"[5, 7]","(This is not a review, but rather a critique.)NGL is better acted than most Christian films--the leads did a credible job. And the story line of this little film had considerable potential: broken marriage, abandonment--a tragic backstory; reunion ten years later; the wife, now a christian, and husband deal with the challenge of being unequally yoked. However, there are two major problems which strike at the core of this film: Christian marriage/divorce and the gospel. I'll address each in turn:Christian marriage/divorce: God does not honor divorce. In his eyes the divorced husband and wife are still married. SPOILER ALERT: It doesn't matter if the husband signed the divorce papers. The counseling pastor should know that God's laws trump man's laws. If the protagonist had ""legally"" divorced his wife, he could ""legally"" remarry her, if she has not been defiled (Deut 24:4). So, this is a completely artificial plot element. Further, in this case, where the wife is a christian and finds herself still married to a non-believing man, a Christian counselor should advise what Paul teaches in (1 Cor. 7:13,14) ""that the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife...: else were your children unclean, but now are they holy."" The 10-year-old son will also benefit.The gospel: There was a lot of hemming and hawing, but no clear presentation of the gospel. Going to church, and attending Bible studies--these are the proper venues for equipping believers, not for evangelizing the lost. That's the job of each and every believer, to be ready to give an account to any man that asks a reason of the hope that is him with meakness and fear. (1 Peter 3:15). The following were conspicuously absent: Nothing about sin or the consequences of sin (Rom 3:23, Rom 6:23a); nothing about Christ's atonement for sin (Rom 5:8ff) (this would have explained the significance of the title ""NO GREATER LOVE""); nothing about what one must do to be saved (Act 16:30,31); and nothing about God's unspeakable gift (Rom 6:23b).Who was this movie intended for: The believe or non-believer?

The life of single father Jeff, who's about to propose to his girlfriend, is turned upside down when suddenly he's reunited with his wife, Heather, who went missing ten years ago. Jeff and their son get to know her again and it looks like they may become a family again. But Heather is a changed woman; she's a Christian now, and that proves to be a challenge to their relationship. This is where the movie turns strange. This is clearly a Christian film, and yet the Christians in the film are anything but sympathetic. A very unpleasant pastor informs Jeff that a Christian cannot marry a non-Christian and therefore Heather and Jeff cannot remarry. (Minor spoiler in next paragraph) When it turns out they are still legally married because Jeff never signed the divorce papers, the church grudgingly agrees they can continue their marriage, which means Heather is ""supposed to submit to"" Jeff as the ""leader of the family"". (End of spoiler) Jeff's Christian friend David is the mouthpiece of much the film's message and he comes off as condescending, holier than thou and at times even rude.The acting is good; Anthony Tyler Quinn especially delivers a very strong, emotional performance. Again, the basic story is interesting but the film as a whole seems confused.
