They face the enemy at sea and on the main base, but show magnificent acceptance to each other and to their own secret PW and houseboy, Fuji. Whether stationed in the South Pacific or Italy, the crew never rests from antics and scheming.

The three main characters, LT-Commander McHale (Ernest Borgnine), Ensign Parker (Tim Conway) and Captain Binghamton (Joe Flynn) and their encounters with one another are what makes the show. Captain Binghamton's constant attempts to get rid of 'McHale and his pirates' always ends in failure.In these early episodes, Captain Binghamton displays a service decoration on his uniform, which disappears in later episodes, until it is seen again in the movie: 'McHale's Navy Joins the Airforce' and also in Season Three, Episode 3:29 'Will the Real Admiral Please Stand Up', on his 'Admiral's' uniform.In an interesting piece of trivia, in two episodes in this series, the crew members are seen smoking cigarettes: Christy puffs on a cigarette in a scene from Episode 1:16-'The Ensign Gets a Zero' and Tinker is seen drawing on a cigarette while the crew sit around on board the PT 73 in a scene in Episode 1:18 'One of Our Engines is Missing', after these early episodes, no one is seen smoking again in any of the remainder of the entire show's episodes...UNTIL Episode 3:14 'The Missing Link' , where Ensign Parker draws on a couple of 'cigs' as he attempts to 'court' Captain Binghamton's 'Niece'.This DVD also has a reunion of some of the crew members, after some forty years, in a special interview.For anyone who's a McHale's Navy fan, you need to have this set in your collection.",5,Still Great After All These Years,1228694400,"12 8, 2008",2008,1582,"['McHale', 'Navy', 'appeared', 'TV', 'Australia', 'many', 'years', 'still', 'love', 'sitting', 'back', 'watching', 'episodes', 'when', 'have', 'free', 'time', ""'ve"", 'even', 'carted', 'world', 'work', 'travels', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'LT-Commander', 'McHale', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'Ensign', 'Parker', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'Captain', 'Binghamton', 'Joe', 'Flynn', 'encounters', 'one', 'are', 'show', 'Captain', 'Binghamton', 'constant', 'attempts', 'get', 'rid', ""'McHale"", 'pirates', 'always', 'failure.In', 'early', 'episodes', 'Captain', 'Binghamton', 'service', 'decoration', 'uniform', 'later', 'episodes', 'seen', 'again', 'movie', ""'McHale"", 'Navy', 'Airforce', 'also', 'Season', 'Three', 'Episode', '3:29', 'Real', 'Admiral', 'Please', 'Stand', 'Up', ""'Admiral"", 'uniform.In', 'interesting', 'piece', 'trivia', 'two', 'episodes', 'series', 'crew', 'members', 'are', 'seen', 'smoking', 'cigarettes', 'Christy', 'puffs', 'cigarette', 'scene', 'Episode', ""1:16-'The"", 'Ensign', 'Zero', 'Tinker', 'seen', 'drawing', 'cigarette', 'crew', 'sit', 'board', 'PT', '73', 'scene', 'Episode', '1:18', ""'One"", 'Engines', 'Missing', 'early', 'episodes', 'one', 'seen', 'smoking', 'again', 'remainder', 'entire', 'show', 'episodes', 'UNTIL', 'Episode', '3:14', ""'The"", 'Missing', 'Link', 'where', 'Ensign', 'Parker', 'couple', ""'cigs"", ""'court"", 'Captain', 'Binghamton', ""'Niece'.This"", 'DVD', 'also', 'reunion', 'crew', 'members', 'forty', 'years', 'special', 'interview.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'McHale', 'Navy', 'fan', 'need', 'have', 'set', 'collection']","Mchale's Navy: Season 1, Vol. 1"

The show was created at a time when WWII shows were hot, as WWII was not yet 20 years in our past. At about the same time, you had other shows like Combat!, The Rat Patrol, and 12 O'Clock High. Of these McHale's Navy was unique in being a comedy.You get to see Tim Conway, and early looks at Gavin MacLeod and Bob Hoskins.Sadly, although he was in a lot of TV and film I watched in the 60s, I just never could warm up to Joe Flynn's single character persona, present here as Captain Binghamton. Of course, he was always the foil, so you weren't meant to warm up to him. Still, other notable character foils managed to do so without being quite as irritating. (Ted Baxter in Mary Tyler Moore, or Richard Deacon in The Dick Van Dyke Show, as examples).I wouldn't spend any small fortunes to obtain this series, but if you can get a good deal on it, including buying used at a low price, you won't regret it, as there are laughs aplenty in store.",4,Solid comedy with a surprising cast.,1278979200,"07 13, 2010",2010,1208,"['kid', 'always', 'welcomed', 'week', 'episode', 'McHale', 'Navy', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'how', 'McHale', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'was', 'going', 'pull', 'one', 'Captain', 'Bingamton', 'week.The', 'story', 'PT', 'boat', 'commander', 'crew', 'South', 'Pacific', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'show', 'was', 'created', 'time', 'when', 'WWII', 'shows', 'were', 'hot', 'WWII', 'was', 'not', 'yet', '20', 'years', 'past', 'same', 'time', 'had', 'other', 'shows', 'Combat', 'Rat', 'Patrol', '12', ""O'Clock"", 'High', 'McHale', 'Navy', 'was', 'unique', 'being', 'comedy.You', 'get', 'see', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'early', 'looks', 'Gavin', 'MacLeod', 'Bob', 'Hoskins.Sadly', 'was', 'lot', 'TV', 'film', 'watched', '60s', 'just', 'never', 'could', 'warm', 'up', 'Joe', 'Flynn', 'single', 'character', 'persona', 'present', 'here', 'Captain', 'Binghamton', 'course', 'was', 'always', 'foil', 'were', ""n't"", 'meant', 'warm', 'up', 'Still', 'other', 'notable', 'character', 'foils', 'managed', 'do', 'so', 'being', 'quite', 'irritating', 'Ted', 'Baxter', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Richard', 'Deacon', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Show', 'examples', '.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'spend', 'small', 'fortunes', 'obtain', 'series', 'can', 'get', 'good', 'deal', 'including', 'buying', 'used', 'low', 'price', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'are', 'laughs', 'aplenty', 'store']","Mchale's Navy: Season 1, Vol. 1"
