In Peacemaker Kurogane, we get essentially the same story, only this time from the point of view of the Pro-Tokugawa forces - in particular the Shinsengumi guard, several of whom were supporting characters in the Kenshin franchise - and this rather underated historical actioner is an excellent companion piece to it's more famous counterpart.It follows the story of the real-life Tetsunosuke Ichimora, age 15.  After the brutal murder of his parents at the hands of Loyalists, Tetsu vows to join the Shinsengumi over the objections of his frantic big brother Tatsunosuke.  His life becomes entwined with that of other characters both real and fictional, most notably becoming page to the strict Vice Commander Toshizo Hijikata - who doubts Tetsu will have what it takes when the time for battle arrives; and taken under the wing by painfully young Captain Soji Okita, historically documented to have loved children - who is already beginning to show signs of the Tuberculosis which would eventually kill him and perhaps sensing that he doesn't have much time before becoming incapacitated tries to help Tetsu maintain the moral and spiritual innocence that he himself can never get back.Can Tetsu find his place in the world and strike a balance between Tatsu's potentially emotionally cripling overprotectiveness and the weight on his soul that joining the fight against the Loyalists might entail?  Will vengeance rule his heart, or will he become a peacemaker as his parents would have wanted him to be?An anime that any fan of historical fiction should enjoy.",4,Another perspective,1182556800,"06 23, 2007",2007,1720,"['large', 'number', 'anime', 'fans', 'are', 'familiar', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin/Samurai', 'X', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'Meiji', 'Revolution', 'Loyalist', 'point', 'view', 'Peacemaker', 'Kurogane', 'get', 'essentially', 'same', 'story', 'only', 'time', 'point', 'view', 'Pro-Tokugawa', 'forces', 'particular', 'Shinsengumi', 'guard', 'several', 'whom', 'were', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Kenshin', 'franchise', 'rather', 'underated', 'historical', 'actioner', 'excellent', 'companion', 'piece', 'more', 'famous', 'counterpart.It', 'story', 'real-life', 'Tetsunosuke', 'Ichimora', 'age', '15', 'brutal', 'murder', 'parents', 'hands', 'Loyalists', 'Tetsu', 'join', 'Shinsengumi', 'objections', 'frantic', 'big', 'brother', 'Tatsunosuke', 'life', 'becomes', 'entwined', 'other', 'characters', 'real', 'fictional', 'most', 'notably', 'becoming', 'page', 'strict', 'Vice', 'Commander', 'Toshizo', 'Hijikata', 'who', 'doubts', 'Tetsu', 'will', 'have', 'what', 'when', 'time', 'battle', 'arrives', 'taken', 'wing', 'painfully', 'young', 'Captain', 'Soji', 'Okita', 'historically', 'documented', 'have', 'loved', 'children', 'who', 'already', 'beginning', 'show', 'signs', 'Tuberculosis', 'would', 'eventually', 'kill', 'perhaps', 'sensing', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'time', 'becoming', 'incapacitated', 'tries', 'help', 'Tetsu', 'maintain', 'moral', 'spiritual', 'innocence', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'back.Can', 'Tetsu', 'find', 'place', 'world', 'strike', 'balance', 'Tatsu', 'potentially', 'emotionally', 'cripling', 'overprotectiveness', 'weight', 'soul', 'joining', 'fight', 'Loyalists', 'might', 'entail', 'Will', 'vengeance', 'rule', 'heart', 'will', 'become', 'peacemaker', 'parents', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'be', 'anime', 'fan', 'historical', 'fiction', 'should', 'enjoy']",Peacemaker - Complete Collection

Normally I wouldn't care because I generally just want to watch the anime episodes themselves, but I _really_ liked the short, narrated stories that came as extras with the other DVDs (especially the narrations by Hijikata, Okita, and the trio of jokers). So, be warned!This version has both the Japanese voices with English subtitles and the English voices.The anime series itself is wonderful, and it's definitely slashable, if you're so inclined.",4,"I love the anime, but the extras are missing from this version!",1132531200,"11 21, 2005",2005,538,"['Okay', 'price', 'really', 'reasonable', 'watch', 'out', 'are', '_no_', 'extras', 'here', 'Normally', 'would', ""n't"", 'care', 'generally', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'anime', '_really_', 'liked', 'short', 'narrated', 'stories', 'came', 'extras', 'other', 'DVDs', 'especially', 'narrations', 'Hijikata', 'Okita', 'trio', 'jokers', 'So', 'be', 'warned', 'version', 'Japanese', 'voices', 'English', 'subtitles', 'English', 'voices.The', 'anime', 'series', 'wonderful', 'definitely', 'slashable', ""'re"", 'so', 'inclined']",Peacemaker - Complete Collection

935816,AFV2584U13XP3,B000B5IOPC,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[0, 0]","I actually got this at the time I was watching the series Rurouni Kenshin and the Samurai X movies it's amazing seeing how these series give both sides a claim to their views of their reasoning for which side they fought for and why.  This series deals more favorable with the Shinsengumi giving them a more humanized appeal to the viewers and their personal reasons or feelings for which they joined up for.  The series also seems to focus more on Tetsu an idealistic young man who feels that if he joins the Shinsengumi group he'll become strong enough to avenge the deaths of his parents and protect his love ones.  His older brother Tatsunosuke sees the more realistic points for trying to stop his brother from joining the Shinsengumi as the way he feels now.  In the group you will also have some who will either encourage or try to dissuade Tetsu from the path he's on.  The animation is great as well as the voice actors they got for this series the video is full-screen with 5.1 Englishor Japanese audio.  The extras aren't much pretty much the usual trailersand intro/ending songs but for the price this great series is well worth it.  I will say like some other anime series this is not really a familyanime as there is a great deal of violence,bloody deaths,and mature themes some younger family members or friends should see.  After you're done with this series I say try watching the Samurai X box set or the Rurouni Kenshin series to see the opposing sides view of the Shinsengumiboth these series sets are also very good though with the Samurai X box set I'd advise watching it subbed unfortunately the English voice actors for that set weren't as good as the actors for the Rurouni Kenshin seriesset..",5,A Great Anime At The Look Of The Chaotic Times During The Meiji Restoration,1215907200,"07 13, 2008",2008,1718,"['actually', 'got', 'time', 'was', 'watching', 'series', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'Samurai', 'X', 'movies', 'amazing', 'seeing', 'how', 'series', 'give', 'sides', 'claim', 'views', 'reasoning', 'side', 'fought', 'why', 'series', 'more', 'favorable', 'Shinsengumi', 'giving', 'more', 'humanized', 'appeal', 'viewers', 'personal', 'reasons', 'feelings', 'joined', 'up', 'series', 'also', 'focus', 'more', 'Tetsu', 'idealistic', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'Shinsengumi', 'group', ""'ll"", 'become', 'strong', 'enough', 'avenge', 'deaths', 'parents', 'protect', 'love', 'ones', 'older', 'brother', 'Tatsunosuke', 'more', 'realistic', 'points', 'trying', 'stop', 'brother', 'joining', 'Shinsengumi', 'way', 'now', 'group', 'will', 'also', 'have', 'who', 'will', 'encourage', 'try', 'dissuade', 'Tetsu', 'path', 'animation', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'voice', 'actors', 'got', 'series', 'video', 'full-screen', '5.1', 'Englishor', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'extras', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'pretty', 'much', 'usual', 'trailersand', 'intro/ending', 'songs', 'price', 'great', 'series', 'well', 'worth', 'will', 'say', 'other', 'anime', 'series', 'not', 'really', 'familyanime', 'great', 'deal', 'violence', 'bloody', 'deaths', 'mature', 'themes', 'younger', 'family', 'members', 'friends', 'should', 'see', ""'re"", 'done', 'series', 'say', 'try', 'watching', 'Samurai', 'X', 'box', 'set', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'series', 'see', 'opposing', 'sides', 'view', 'Shinsengumiboth', 'series', 'sets', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Samurai', 'X', 'box', 'set', ""'d"", 'advise', 'watching', 'subbed', 'unfortunately', 'English', 'voice', 'actors', 'set', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'actors', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'seriesset..']",Peacemaker - Complete Collection
