My son was absolutely nuts, but here is a problem that I need to warn all of the parents. The Thomas & Friends DVD's have several stories which is what my son expected (he is 5 y.0.)  This is just ONE story and the bonus story has nothing to do with Thomas, but a race car. My son had the biggest tantrum because he couldn't understand why was it only one story and the bonus story was about a car! So do not expect a bunch of little Thomas & Friends stories like the other DVD's. It's one story.",4,"Highly recommend, but....",1236556800,"03 9, 2009",2009,564,"['How', 'cute', 'Thomas', 'other', 'trains', 'actually', 'talking', 'son', 'was', 'absolutely', 'nuts', 'here', 'problem', 'need', 'warn', 'parents', 'Thomas', 'Friends', 'DVD', 'have', 'several', 'stories', 'what', 'son', 'expected', '5', 'y.0', 'just', 'ONE', 'story', 'bonus', 'story', 'nothing', 'do', 'Thomas', 'race', 'car', 'son', 'had', 'biggest', 'tantrum', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'story', 'bonus', 'story', 'was', 'car', 'So', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'bunch', 'little', 'Thomas', 'Friends', 'stories', 'other', 'DVD', 'one', 'story']",Thomas & Friends: Railway Friends

It is not only cute and filled with adventure, but educational as well. Not only do children learn about friendship, helping, empathy and sharing, but they also helps them increase their vocabulary and learn to be creative.  My grandson is only 2 1/2 years old and these movies have taught him so much.  I like watching this and discussing it with him.  Family and friends know he loves Thomas & Friends, so he gets lots of related books, has an extensive collection of the trains and railways.  He knows all the trains by name, number and color.  His parents and I have been reading to him and now he is starting to read.  We also have many of the activity books, which are all fabulous!I recommend this to parents, grandparents, & babysitters.  These movies are a great learning tool and very enjoyable too!",5,Thomas & Friends: Railway Friends,1363392000,"03 16, 2013",2013,924,"['many', 'other', 'Thomas', 'Friends', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'books', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'grandson', 'not', 'only', 'cute', 'filled', 'adventure', 'educational', 'as', 'well', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'children', 'learn', 'friendship', 'helping', 'empathy', 'sharing', 'also', 'increase', 'vocabulary', 'learn', 'be', 'creative', 'grandson', 'only', '2', '1/2', 'years', 'old', 'movies', 'have', 'taught', 'so', 'much', 'like', 'watching', 'discussing', 'Family', 'friends', 'know', 'Thomas', 'Friends', 'lots', 'related', 'books', 'extensive', 'collection', 'trains', 'railways', 'trains', 'name', 'number', 'color', 'parents', 'have', 'been', 'reading', 'now', 'starting', 'read', 'also', 'have', 'many', 'activity', 'books', 'are', 'fabulous', 'recommend', 'parents', 'grandparents', 'babysitters', 'movies', 'are', 'great', 'learning', 'tool', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'too']",Thomas & Friends: Railway Friends
