And when Little Bow Wow joined the NBA, performed insane tricks, and got attention from all of the NBA, well, I actually had to run to the bathroom and dunk my head in the sink and remind myself it was just a movie. I walked back, and watched more. It wasn't until Little Bow Wow was bragging to his little friend about getting room service that...I wept. I shed a tear.

723376,A2KB14WCZ1DVE3,B00006SFL7,elvistcob@lvcm.com,"[2, 3]","OK, so two of our children watched the movie and liked it.  I guess it was made for them, and at that level is not that bad, but it's not a great one for parents to endure.  If you want glowing reviews, check the under-12 review section.This is the story of an orphan who gets picked on by bigger guys.  He comes across some shoes that have ""MJ"" initialed in them.  When he puts them on he becomes the best basketball player in the world, humiliating today's current stars, who all seem to be having  a good time in the movie.Two reasons it can't get more stars than me.  Maybe the kids have not seen countless films with exactly the same plot, so for them it's pretty fresh.  But this is the same old story of a very bad team getting some new factor added to their chemistry that makes them winners.  When the new factor is there, they all play way above their former levels.  When the new factor is not available, they all stand around not knowing what to do.  And there is a big game at the end, where the factor showing up or not, instead of everybody continuing on their own merits becomes the big concern.  And on and on.But that doesn't bug me so much.  Part of the economy of Hollywood consists of the need to put out new products every week, and there are only so many original ideas.  It's not art, but it keeps people employed and young ones who don't know any better occupied for awhile.What does bother me is when the factor introduced to make the team a winner gives them an unfair advantage.  ""Angels in the Outfield"" did the same thing.  In that movie, balls were caught that shouldn't have been, and hits were made that shouldn't have been.  As rewards come with winning, it means that the team that has just won with this unfair advantage, and the losing team, with more talent, does not get these rewards.  Also, in the case of this movie, who is the player who has to work hard, but get benched when a little kid with magic shoes bumps him out of the lineup?Finally, the writers have to be careful when constructing the ""factor"" that makes the play better.  What if the kid found a bottle of magic pills that did the same thing?  That would be a big no-no, as we start getting into performance-enhancing-drug territory.  But then, if drugs are banned because they can give an unfair (if short-term) advantage, aren't magic shoes in the same territory?  Or angels?  Or flubber?  I hate to be a spoil-sport on this, but I think these movies teach kids to look for the gimmick to win, instead of working hard, which is what it's going to take in real life.",2,Same old plot is not as bad as the premise,1046649600,"03 3, 2003",2003,2573,"['OK', 'so', 'two', 'children', 'watched', 'movie', 'liked', 'guess', 'was', 'made', 'level', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'parents', 'endure', 'want', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'check', 'under-12', 'review', 'section.This', 'story', 'orphan', 'who', 'picked', 'bigger', 'guys', 'shoes', 'have', 'MJ', 'initialed', 'When', 'best', 'basketball', 'player', 'world', 'humiliating', 'today', 'current', 'stars', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'movie.Two', 'reasons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'stars', 'Maybe', 'kids', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'countless', 'films', 'exactly', 'same', 'plot', 'so', 'pretty', 'fresh', 'same', 'old', 'story', 'very', 'bad', 'team', 'getting', 'new', 'factor', 'added', 'chemistry', 'winners', 'When', 'new', 'factor', 'there', 'play', 'way', 'former', 'levels', 'When', 'new', 'factor', 'not', 'available', 'stand', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'do', 'big', 'game', 'end', 'where', 'factor', 'showing', 'up', 'not', 'instead', 'everybody', 'continuing', 'own', 'merits', 'big', 'concern', 'on.But', ""n't"", 'bug', 'so', 'much', 'Part', 'economy', 'Hollywood', 'consists', 'need', 'put', 'out', 'new', 'products', 'week', 'are', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'original', 'ideas', 'not', 'art', 'people', 'employed', 'young', 'ones', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'occupied', 'awhile.What', 'bother', 'when', 'factor', 'introduced', 'make', 'team', 'winner', 'unfair', 'advantage', 'Angels', 'Outfield', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'movie', 'balls', 'were', 'caught', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'hits', 'were', 'made', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'rewards', 'come', 'winning', 'team', 'just', 'won', 'unfair', 'advantage', 'losing', 'team', 'more', 'talent', 'not', 'get', 'rewards', 'Also', 'case', 'movie', 'who', 'player', 'who', 'work', 'hard', 'get', 'benched', 'when', 'little', 'kid', 'magic', 'shoes', 'bumps', 'lineup', 'Finally', 'writers', 'have', 'be', 'careful', 'when', 'constructing', 'factor', 'play', 'better', 'What', 'kid', 'found', 'bottle', 'magic', 'pills', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'would', 'be', 'big', 'no-no', 'start', 'getting', 'performance-enhancing-drug', 'territory', 'then', 'drugs', 'are', 'banned', 'can', 'give', 'unfair', 'short-term', 'advantage', 'are', ""n't"", 'magic', 'shoes', 'same', 'territory', 'angels', 'flubber', 'hate', 'be', 'spoil-sport', 'think', 'movies', 'teach', 'kids', 'look', 'gimmick', 'win', 'instead', 'working', 'hard', 'what', 'going', 'take', 'real', 'life']",Like Mike

It's basically one of those Disney live action things we saw as kids in a ""cafetorium"" while sitting cross-legged -- you know, the ones with the short beforehand that started with the paintbrush ""painting in"" the wildlife setting? (""In the Spraaaang, the young otters retahrn to Bahr Coun-tree..."") Anyone who ever saw ""The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes"" will recognize the tone and plot of the ""Like Mike"" instantly.The performances are pretty good, though. Despite straight-as-an-arrow writing that has no surprises, you get people like Eugene Levy in the supporting parts. You get some fun cameos from real NBA players, and you get Crispin Glover as a truly creepy villain for a movie like this. The coach of l'il Bow Wow's team does a decent job with little to go on, and aside from Glover the adults and kids in the movie interact pretty credibly. Nobody's a complete idiot -- that's kind of unusual in a kids' movie, now I think of it. The movie's well-cast and well-acted, for what it is.Most of all, though, you get Morris Chestnut's performance as Tracy, the NBA player assigned to keep track of the kid phenom.

723382,A2D9IEFJGB483Q,B00006SFL7,Kendal B. Hunter,"[0, 0]","I didn't have high hopes for this film.  It seemed to be a gimmicky Hollywood cookie-cutter, with the flavor of the month in the leading role.  True, the film had these elements; however, due to superb writing, this movie broke the Hollywood mold.The main characters have their personalities, but the secondary characters are able to stand on their own.  The were more than place holders; they were actually people.  I think the key moment is when Calvin's friend Murph puts on the shoes, hoping to be able to play like Mike.  Token eccentric Crispin Glover (George McFly) plays the evil manager of the orphanage with a subtle flair.  He is like Brendan Frasier or Peter Weller-they all have talent; it's just tricky to find good roles for them.This movie is a nice family movie.  It reinforces the values of diversity-the old talent of Tracy Reynolds with the new talent of Calvin Cambridge, and also Calvin's friendship with Asian Reg Stevens and Caucasian Murph.  It has subtle elements of reconciliation-Tracey reconciles with Calvin, Tracey reconciles with his estranged father, and Calvin reconciles with the bully Ox.  This movie is also about living your dreams, and working toward a worthy goal.  And that you cannot beat!I have only two objections to this movie.  The first is obvious: whoever thought that having a kid climb a tree to grab shoes off a wire should be shot!  Especially climbing a tree in the rain during an electrical storm!  The wet shoes would conduct electricity, and be grounded through Calvin's body, ending the story before it began.  And beyond the bad physics, this is absolutely the wrong thing to show in a family movie.Two replacement ideas for this rather dumb scene are as follows:  They could have the adventurers look up at the sneakers, and Calvin want to get the shoes, but Murph say that it is dangerous to climb wires, and then have the wind blow the sneakers down.  This would get the shows down, and replace the galvanizing symbolism of  electricity with the subtle inspiration symbolism of wind.  You get the power of myth without the power of bad example.The other option would be to eliminate the electricity altogether.  You could have Calvin put on the shoes, and just begin playing better-a la Cinderella.  This would make the story a bit more ambiguous and more intriguing.  Is it the shoes, or is it Calvin's power of faith?My second beef with this film is that  it reinforces the idea that they way out of the ghetto is on the basketball court or in the studio recording rap music.  They way out of the ghetto is the same as the way out of the trailer-park, and it involves being realistic, learning a marketable skill at school, and developing a obsession with drudgery.  I know this is a fantasy film, but all myths need to be gounded in some reality, or they become meaningless.3 stars-It's a good film, but the ""live wire"" scene is inexcusable.",3,"Despite gimmicks, this is a well-written film!",1045094400,"02 13, 2003",2003,2905,"['did', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'gimmicky', 'Hollywood', 'cookie-cutter', 'flavor', 'month', 'leading', 'role', 'True', 'film', 'had', 'elements', 'however', 'due', 'superb', 'writing', 'movie', 'broke', 'Hollywood', 'mold.The', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'personalities', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'able', 'stand', 'own', 'were', 'more', 'place', 'holders', 'were', 'actually', 'people', 'think', 'key', 'moment', 'when', 'Calvin', 'friend', 'Murph', 'shoes', 'hoping', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'Mike', 'Token', 'eccentric', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'George', 'McFly', 'evil', 'manager', 'orphanage', 'subtle', 'flair', 'Brendan', 'Frasier', 'Peter', 'Weller-they', 'have', 'talent', 'just', 'tricky', 'find', 'good', 'roles', 'them.This', 'movie', 'nice', 'family', 'movie', 'values', 'diversity-the', 'old', 'talent', 'Tracy', 'Reynolds', 'new', 'talent', 'Calvin', 'Cambridge', 'also', 'Calvin', 'friendship', 'Asian', 'Reg', 'Stevens', 'Caucasian', 'Murph', 'subtle', 'elements', 'reconciliation-Tracey', 'reconciles', 'Calvin', 'Tracey', 'estranged', 'father', 'Calvin', 'reconciles', 'bully', 'Ox', 'movie', 'also', 'living', 'dreams', 'working', 'worthy', 'goal', 'can', 'not', 'beat', 'have', 'only', 'two', 'objections', 'movie', 'first', 'obvious', 'whoever', 'thought', 'having', 'kid', 'tree', 'grab', 'shoes', 'off', 'wire', 'should', 'be', 'shot', 'Especially', 'climbing', 'tree', 'rain', 'electrical', 'storm', 'wet', 'shoes', 'would', 'conduct', 'electricity', 'be', 'grounded', 'Calvin', 'body', 'ending', 'story', 'began', 'bad', 'physics', 'absolutely', 'wrong', 'thing', 'show', 'family', 'movie.Two', 'replacement', 'ideas', 'rather', 'dumb', 'scene', 'are', 'could', 'have', 'adventurers', 'look', 'up', 'sneakers', 'Calvin', 'want', 'get', 'shoes', 'Murph', 'say', 'dangerous', 'climb', 'wires', 'then', 'have', 'wind', 'sneakers', 'down', 'would', 'get', 'shows', 'down', 'replace', 'galvanizing', 'symbolism', 'electricity', 'subtle', 'inspiration', 'symbolism', 'wind', 'get', 'power', 'myth', 'power', 'bad', 'example.The', 'other', 'option', 'would', 'be', 'eliminate', 'electricity', 'altogether', 'could', 'have', 'Calvin', 'put', 'shoes', 'just', 'begin', 'playing', 'better-a', 'la', 'Cinderella', 'would', 'make', 'story', 'bit', 'more', 'ambiguous', 'more', 'intriguing', 'shoes', 'Calvin', 'power', 'faith', 'second', 'beef', 'film', 'idea', 'way', 'ghetto', 'basketball', 'court', 'studio', 'recording', 'rap', 'music', 'way', 'ghetto', 'same', 'way', 'trailer-park', 'being', 'realistic', 'learning', 'marketable', 'skill', 'school', 'developing', 'obsession', 'drudgery', 'know', 'fantasy', 'film', 'myths', 'need', 'be', 'gounded', 'reality', 'become', 'meaningless.3', 'stars-It', 'good', 'film', 'live', 'wire', 'scene', 'inexcusable']",Like Mike

When you got actors like Lil' Bow Wow, Jonthan Lipnicki and Morris Chestnut and the game of Basketball, how can you even ask for more. Well, maybe the movie doesn't have Michael Jordan, but you have a lot of famous people who make camos in this movie. Here is what Like Mike is about. Calvin Cambridge (Lil' Bow Wow) is a big basketball fan that can't play the sport very good. He is an orphan, and one night during a game, Calvin, his best freind Murph (Jonthan Lipnicki) has to be on the street outside Staples Center salling candy. He meets the coach of the L.A. Knights, and he tells Calvin that he will have some tickets waiting for him on a Sunday night game. Calvin takes Murph and some orphans to the game, where during half time, a lucky person gets to play 1 on 1 with Tracey Reyolds (Morris Chestnut) and a ticket is drawn, and Calvin has the winning ticket, and he uses sneakers that he found that has gotten struck by lighting and turns him into a basketball super star an before he knows it, an exetive from the L.A. Nights named Frank Bertand (Eugene Lavy) signs him to a contract. At first the team gaves him sneakers to wear, but he fakes a bathroom break and puts on and ties up his sneakers.And now for the best part on my review of Like Mike, my comments. First this movie reminded me of Eddie, Rookie of the Year and Angles in the Outfield (1994). And you have an actor named Jessie Plemons who plays Calvin's rival Ox. Why does Hollywood like to make a lot of fantasy movies? I mean, if you were on druing a strom wouldn't you in real life be struck by lighting? Or die from touching powerlines, whether you touch them or they touch you? Next thing, would a real team pull a person (or people) out of the stands to be either honory coach or play one on one with a basketball player? This was the first time in young Jonthan Lipnicki's career as an actor that he has had to movies out at the same time. The other is Stuart Little 2. I reccomend this movie to people who love sports or basketball movies. In fact, I would rather watch this movie, then see my local NBA (Chicago Bulls). And have to be happy that none of the current Chicago Bulls that are in this movie. I also reccomend this movie if you love to watch movies on dvd that has deleted scenes.

Soooo, I bought and called myself reviewing it, and fell in love with Lil Bow Wow myself. You just cannot help but adore him. Morris Chestnut is still foine as usual, but very reluctant to bring Calvin into his space. The part where he tells Calvin that he adopted him was so sweet it made me want to cry. Fine script,good acting, and great moves. When Bow Wow tried asking one of the opposing team members for an autograph was classic. Making that shot and not being able to get down was another.. Selling candy and the people saying who would buy candy from him was another. Ok. So, I am a Bow Wow fan.

After he laces up a mysterious pair of old sneakers, inscribed with faded initials ""M J,"" Calvin makes the leap from playground hijinks to NBA superstardom... hitting 25-foot jumpers, making behind-the-back passes and slamming home devastating dunks.
