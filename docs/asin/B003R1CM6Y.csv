Like the books there is always a lot going on.  Very vivid colors, and the voices are friendly.  Easy to navigate DVD's, and they seem to play for hours upon end.  We've had them for a month and still haven't watched all the episodes!  A classic educational treasure at a great price!",5,Great fun!,1297900800,"02 17, 2011",2011,426,"['Richard', 'Scarry', 'bright', 'colorful', 'books', 'brought', 'life', 'Great', 'full', 'life', 'lessons', 'told', 'fun', 'way', 'keeping', 'boys', 'entertained', 'books', 'always', 'lot', 'going', 'Very', 'vivid', 'colors', 'voices', 'are', 'friendly', 'Easy', 'navigate', 'DVD', 'seem', 'play', 'hours', 'upon', 'end', ""'ve"", 'had', 'month', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'episodes', 'classic', 'educational', 'treasure', 'great', 'price']",The Busy World of Richard Scarry: Every Day There's Something New

Although the characters are the same, the stories are different.

It was one of my all-time favorite animated series from the 1990s. I was extremely surprised when I ran in to this 3 Disc DVD set right here on Amazon and I had manage purchased it last year. This has only 30 episodes. That's half of the show I got for my collection. There's another DVD set going to be release on July 19, 2011. The DVD title is called ""Fun in Busytown"". It contains 35 episodes. That's the other half of the series. I recently find it right here on Amazon earilier this week. To be perfectly honest, I been praying for this DVD set to be released. And now it's finally answered. I'm really looking forward in getting it. And the only thing that I want to say about Cookie Jar and Mill Creek Enterainment is I'm extremely grateful for bringing this series to DVD and memories back.",5,Revisiting My Childhood,1307750400,"06 11, 2011",2011,885,"['was', ""n't"", '4', 'when', 'start', 'watching', 'Busy', 'World', 'Richard', 'Scarry', 'love', 'was', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'animated', 'series', '1990s', 'was', 'extremely', 'surprised', 'when', 'ran', '3', 'Disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'right', 'here', 'Amazon', 'had', 'manage', 'purchased', 'last', 'year', 'only', '30', 'episodes', 'half', 'show', 'got', 'collection', 'DVD', 'set', 'going', 'be', 'release', 'July', '19', '2011', 'DVD', 'title', 'called', 'Fun', 'Busytown', '35', 'episodes', 'other', 'half', 'series', 'recently', 'find', 'right', 'here', 'Amazon', 'earilier', 'week', 'be', 'perfectly', 'honest', 'been', 'praying', 'DVD', 'set', 'be', 'released', 'now', 'finally', 'answered', ""'m"", 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'getting', 'only', 'thing', 'want', 'say', 'Cookie', 'Jar', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'Enterainment', ""'m"", 'extremely', 'grateful', 'bringing', 'series', 'DVD', 'memories', 'back']",The Busy World of Richard Scarry: Every Day There's Something New
