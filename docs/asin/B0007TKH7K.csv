Watching the old clips from her 70's show really made me want them on DVD so I signed onto Amazon.com to see if they were available. To my amazement, I found that there are only TWO EPISODES PER VOLUME and very costly!!I hope they consider box sets with multiple episodes SOON..when this happens I will be the first in line to purchase them. But at TWO EPISODES PER VOLUME AT THOSE PRICES???!!!

889498,A1USQH50ILYFZG,B0007TKH7K,Jon Nelson,"[40, 44]","Carol Burnett was clearly in her element during the Q&A part of her series, and this DVD shows many of the funniest highlights the show has to offer. It's also great to see that Carol, Vicki Lawrence, Tim Conway, and Harvey Korman still have it now, even 30 years later. Their quick wit, comic timing, and gift for ad-libbing shine through!

Just for them to share some of their favorite schenes  showed  how much they enjoyed doing the show and how they ad-libed some of the scenes.
