978564,A1TP2RW7KDI5AZ,B000ESSTLU,"John Werner ""JWW""","[0, 0]","When the first America album came out in late '71 (about). I was in the seventh grade.  It made an impression with the obvious blockbuster hit &#34;Horse With No Name&#34;, but also due to the several other cuts that WJLN  of Birmingham, Alabama (an old station with a new progressive rock format, i.e., albums not singles) played.  Those cuts included Sandman,  I Need You, and Riverside.  There was something very Neil Young/Buffalo Springfield about them, but it was even more accessible and it grabbed the ear, then the real acid test of making it on into the psyche.  I can't really tell someone who wasn't born into this time how big this stuff so suddenly became.  It was as if an acoustic Beatles (3-vocal harmonies) had plopped right down.  Dan Peek has several interviews you can access on YouTube that make it clear it was &#34;extreme&#34; for him to almost overnight go from zero to practically having the means to do anything or have whatever you wanted.  This was at a time when the music business was approaching it's zenith in both cultural and monetary powers. It helped, immensely, that America consisted of three very talented singers who were better than average guitarists  and wrote brilliant songs individually and as a unit.Way back I rented the Live In Central Park laserdisc.  I liked it well enough to make a BetaHi-Fi video cassette dub.  There were, however nagging problems with the completeness, the poor editing, and the deal-breaker which was the horrible sound quality.  This was the real America at a stage where they'd had a sizable degree of success, but were still fresh and vital.  In the end it just wasn't a concert I found myself returning to for the reasons already mentioned.  While it would be wonderful to get a modernized re-cut video of that concert with sound from the actual multi-track audio master (it was as I understand captured on 35mm film and in 16-track sound), and since I'm just dreaming here:  maybe even widescreen video if 1.85:1  PanaVision or some other wide-screen formatted film stock was used to originally derive the 4:3 standard of the day.  Then that would be the America that would best represent what they once were.  Of course the wish for that old concert to appear in that form is not going to make it happen.  So, until, or if that never happens, I am more than happy to recommend America In Concert - Live at the Sydney Opera House to fans as the best video example of America.Gerry is the heart and soul of the group, but he wouldn't be America without Dewey.  I knew Gerry was prominent, but until this video it didn't register exactly how much.  t do mis Peek, more on certain songs such as  Woman Tonight,  and even more so with the realization that his passed away earlier this week thus making a real America reunion never possible, but this concert is extremely gratifying.  The sound is tons better here than anything Ive come across for America.  I do think the cymbals could be brought up in the mix to where they're more constantly up.  This makes a difference to me, but your mileage may vary.  Overall a well put together video concert of the later day America who holds the almost mythical tradition up of that original 1971 version without shaming it.  Of special mention is the fact that here we get a concert, finally, without the manic &#34;edit-nervosa&#34;  which is, sadly, more the norm today than not.  Yes, you actually can relax and feel like you bond a little with the band members before we're on to the next edit.  Mainly for fans, but like I said there is something really accessible about the music of America and this concert, without flash or bombast, is fine example of that.",4,A Good Sounding & Looking America Concert,1399680000,"05 10, 2014",2014,3687,"['When', 'first', 'America', 'album', 'came', 'out', 'late', ""'71"", 'was', 'seventh', 'grade', 'made', 'impression', 'obvious', 'blockbuster', 'hit', '34', 'Horse', 'No', 'Name', '34', 'also', 'due', 'several', 'other', 'cuts', 'WJLN', 'Birmingham', 'Alabama', 'old', 'station', 'new', 'progressive', 'rock', 'format', 'i.e.', 'albums', 'not', 'singles', 'played', 'cuts', 'included', 'Sandman', 'Need', 'Riverside', 'was', 'something', 'very', 'Neil', 'Young/Buffalo', 'Springfield', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'accessible', 'grabbed', 'ear', 'then', 'real', 'acid', 'test', 'making', 'psyche', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'someone', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'born', 'time', 'how', 'big', 'stuff', 'so', 'suddenly', 'became', 'was', 'acoustic', 'Beatles', '3-vocal', 'harmonies', 'had', 'plopped', 'right', 'down', 'Dan', 'Peek', 'several', 'interviews', 'can', 'access', 'YouTube', 'make', 'clear', 'was', '34', 'extreme', '34', 'almost', 'overnight', 'go', 'zero', 'practically', 'having', 'means', 'do', 'anything', 'have', 'wanted', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'music', 'business', 'was', 'approaching', 'zenith', 'cultural', 'monetary', 'powers', 'helped', 'immensely', 'America', 'consisted', 'three', 'very', 'talented', 'singers', 'who', 'were', 'better', 'average', 'guitarists', 'wrote', 'brilliant', 'songs', 'individually', 'unit.Way', 'back', 'rented', 'Live', 'Central', 'Park', 'laserdisc', 'liked', 'well', 'enough', 'make', 'BetaHi-Fi', 'video', 'cassette', 'dub', 'were', 'however', 'nagging', 'problems', 'completeness', 'poor', 'editing', 'deal-breaker', 'was', 'horrible', 'sound', 'quality', 'was', 'real', 'America', 'stage', 'where', ""'d"", 'had', 'sizable', 'degree', 'success', 'were', 'still', 'fresh', 'vital', 'end', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'concert', 'found', 'returning', 'reasons', 'already', 'mentioned', 'would', 'be', 'wonderful', 'get', 'modernized', 're-cut', 'video', 'concert', 'sound', 'actual', 'multi-track', 'audio', 'master', 'was', 'understand', 'captured', '35mm', 'film', '16-track', 'sound', ""'m"", 'just', 'dreaming', 'here', 'maybe', 'even', 'widescreen', 'video', '1.85:1', 'PanaVision', 'other', 'wide-screen', 'formatted', 'film', 'stock', 'was', 'used', 'originally', 'derive', '4:3', 'standard', 'day', 'Then', 'would', 'be', 'America', 'would', 'best', 'represent', 'what', 'once', 'were', 'course', 'wish', 'old', 'concert', 'appear', 'form', 'not', 'going', 'make', 'happen', 'So', 'never', 'am', 'more', 'happy', 'recommend', 'America', 'Concert', 'Live', 'Sydney', 'Opera', 'House', 'fans', 'best', 'video', 'example', 'America.Gerry', 'heart', 'soul', 'group', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'America', 'Dewey', 'knew', 'Gerry', 'was', 'prominent', 'video', 'did', ""n't"", 'register', 'exactly', 'how', 'much', 't', 'do', 'mis', 'Peek', 'more', 'certain', 'songs', 'such', 'Woman', 'Tonight', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'realization', 'passed', 'away', 'earlier', 'week', 'thus', 'making', 'real', 'America', 'reunion', 'never', 'possible', 'concert', 'extremely', 'gratifying', 'sound', 'tons', 'better', 'here', 'anything', 'Ive', 'come', 'America', 'do', 'think', 'cymbals', 'could', 'be', 'brought', 'up', 'mix', 'where', ""'re"", 'more', 'constantly', 'up', 'difference', 'mileage', 'may', 'vary', 'Overall', 'well', 'together', 'video', 'concert', 'later', 'day', 'America', 'who', 'almost', 'mythical', 'tradition', 'original', '1971', 'version', 'shaming', 'special', 'mention', 'fact', 'here', 'get', 'concert', 'finally', 'manic', '34', 'edit-nervosa', '34', 'sadly', 'more', 'norm', 'today', 'not', 'Yes', 'actually', 'can', 'relax', 'feel', 'bond', 'little', 'band', 'members', ""'re"", 'next', 'edit', 'Mainly', 'fans', 'said', 'something', 'really', 'accessible', 'music', 'America', 'concert', 'flash', 'bombast', 'fine', 'example']",N/A

978567,A3BJDFGSLXFB36,B000ESSTLU,R. Legendre,"[3, 4]","First off, let me say that I LOVE the music of America. Gerry Beckley and Dewey Bunnell are true musicians in every sense of the word. Their songs have become classics and are still revered today. I remember hearing their songs on the radio when I was a little boy and those songs have stayed with me all this time. They even inspired me to take up acoustic guitar and today I am the front man for a local band in New Orleans that plays several America cover tunes.Now, the hard part. This performance by the band is terrible. I was VERY disappointed. I have seen America live 3 times and this DVD does NOT do their live show any justice at all. The production value of the DVD is, however, very good. Sound and picture quality are excellent. The band's playing ability is also very good. The biggest problem I have with this concert is the SINGING.That's right. Dewey and Jerry sound terrible in this performance. The best way I can describe it is that their vocals sounded **lazy**. Whenever either Dewey or Gerry tried to hit the high or powerful notes, it sounded as though they were holding back; like they didn't want to go through the effort of reaching those notes. All too often, they tried to cover up these particular notes by replacing them with ""whoa, whoa, whoa's"" and ""yeah, yeah, yeah's"", but it just didn't work. At certain times, it looks as if reaching some of those notes was actually PAINFUL! There's even a point where Dewey screws up the lyrics of one song and a couple of the other band members laugh at him (while singing ""Wheels are Turning""). Hell, the bass player that sang backup for them sounded better than the 2 lead singers!In their defense, this concert was the second of 2 sold out performances at the Sydney Opera House. Perhaps the band gave their all at the first performance and wore their voices out to where they just couldn't quite cut it for the second show. The harmonies were off and the vocals were just too weak. The band knew it because Dewey and Gerry make up excuses during the small banter between songs claiming that they were nervous.What?? They were NERVOUS??? These guys have played 150 shows a year for the past 30 years and they were NERVOUS? I'm sorry. I just can't accept that. If I were them, I would be embarrased that this show was released on DVD. If their first show was any better, I defintiely would have chosen that one to be released.Very sad.It really pains me to write this review because I hold America in very high regards. I have seen them live in person and know that they are capable of MUCH better performances. There is a DVD available called ""America - In Concert"" that paints a much better picture of what the band is capable of (see my review for it). It was recorded in Germany back in 1999 and is much shorter than this release, but their performance is much better.Well, I still love America and will keep following their career (check out their latest release, ""Here and Now""; VERY GOOD!). I just hope that any future releases are much better than this one.",2,My America conundrum,1185148800,"07 23, 2007",2007,3041,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'say', 'LOVE', 'music', 'America', 'Gerry', 'Beckley', 'Dewey', 'Bunnell', 'are', 'true', 'musicians', 'sense', 'word', 'songs', 'have', 'become', 'classics', 'are', 'still', 'revered', 'today', 'remember', 'hearing', 'songs', 'radio', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'boy', 'songs', 'have', 'stayed', 'time', 'even', 'inspired', 'take', 'up', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'today', 'am', 'front', 'man', 'local', 'band', 'New', 'Orleans', 'several', 'America', 'cover', 'tunes.Now', 'hard', 'part', 'performance', 'band', 'terrible', 'was', 'VERY', 'disappointed', 'have', 'seen', 'America', 'live', '3', 'times', 'DVD', 'NOT', 'do', 'live', 'show', 'justice', 'production', 'value', 'DVD', 'however', 'very', 'good', 'Sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'excellent', 'band', 'playing', 'ability', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'biggest', 'problem', 'have', 'concert', 'SINGING.That', 'right', 'Dewey', 'Jerry', 'sound', 'terrible', 'performance', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'describe', 'vocals', 'sounded', '**lazy**', 'Whenever', 'Dewey', 'Gerry', 'tried', 'hit', 'high', 'powerful', 'notes', 'sounded', 'were', 'holding', 'back', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'effort', 'reaching', 'notes', 'too', 'often', 'tried', 'cover', 'up', 'particular', 'notes', 'replacing', 'whoa', 'whoa', 'whoa', 'yeah', 'yeah', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'certain', 'times', 'reaching', 'notes', 'was', 'actually', 'PAINFUL', 'even', 'point', 'where', 'Dewey', 'up', 'lyrics', 'one', 'song', 'couple', 'other', 'band', 'members', 'laugh', 'singing', 'Wheels', 'are', 'Turning', 'Hell', 'bass', 'player', 'sang', 'backup', 'sounded', 'better', '2', 'lead', 'singers', 'defense', 'concert', 'was', 'second', '2', 'sold', 'out', 'performances', 'Sydney', 'Opera', 'House', 'Perhaps', 'band', 'gave', 'first', 'performance', 'wore', 'voices', 'out', 'where', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'cut', 'second', 'show', 'harmonies', 'were', 'off', 'vocals', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'weak', 'band', 'knew', 'Dewey', 'Gerry', 'make', 'up', 'excuses', 'small', 'banter', 'songs', 'claiming', 'were', 'nervous.What', 'were', 'NERVOUS', 'guys', 'have', 'played', '150', 'shows', 'year', 'past', '30', 'years', 'were', 'NERVOUS', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'were', 'would', 'be', 'embarrased', 'show', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'first', 'show', 'was', 'better', 'defintiely', 'would', 'have', 'chosen', 'one', 'be', 'released.Very', 'sad.It', 'really', 'write', 'review', 'hold', 'America', 'very', 'high', 'regards', 'have', 'seen', 'live', 'person', 'know', 'are', 'capable', 'MUCH', 'better', 'performances', 'DVD', 'available', 'called', 'America', 'Concert', 'much', 'better', 'picture', 'what', 'band', 'capable', 'see', 'review', 'was', 'recorded', 'Germany', 'back', '1999', 'much', 'shorter', 'release', 'performance', 'much', 'better.Well', 'still', 'love', 'America', 'will', 'keep', 'following', 'career', 'check', 'out', 'latest', 'release', 'Here', 'Now', 'VERY', 'GOOD', 'just', 'hope', 'future', 'releases', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'one']",N/A
978568,AYZV1PJP6NXPT,B000ESSTLU,"R. Long ""JaminRebel""","[1, 1]","I bought the Chicago Soundstage dvd which came a few years later. I think that dvd came out in 2009.This Sydney dvd has a lot going for it with songs like ""Never Be Lonely"". ""Everytone I Meet is From CA"" ""All My Life"" ""The Border"" ""CA Dreamin'"", just to name a few songs that one may not hear very often. The band even does""Lonely People"". So Dan Peek songs are represented here also. ""Hangover"" is also a rowdy and rousing tune, one thatI had never heard. The BIGGEST PROBLEM with this dvd is THE VOCAL WORK. Gerry Beckley mentions how the bandhas been touring for a decade doing about 150 or more shows a years. Gerry said ""and we're POOPED."" Well, Idon't know what Beckley's problem was vocally, but CLEARLY the guy's voice WAS SHOT. Beckley sounds prettyAWFUL on this DVD. He sounds much better on the Chicago Soundstage disc. Now I hardly expect Bunnel and Beckley tosound as they did in the 70's, 80's or even the 90's. But I would think that audience members in Australia musthave gone away very disappointed because Beckley and Bunnel and the band simply were NOT UP for a LIVe TAPING ofthat performance. If the guys had been WELL RESTED I think they could have done MUCH better. It's a shame too because the band performed a very nice setlist, very retrospective, covering oldies, oddities, and some new songsas well. It was QUITE PAINFUL at times to watch Beckley STRAINING in VAIN to try to produce vocal sounds. Andclearly, Gerry Beckley is one of the greatest MUMBLERS of all times. It is just so HARD to understand what iscoming out of the guy's mouth. STILL, I AM VERY PLEASED TO OWN THIS DVD. I AM A HUGE FAN OF AMERICA. And Dewey BUNNEL wasn't exactly doing anything special on vocals either, but at least his voice wasn't completely SHOT. I think this must have been an END OF TOUR SHOW because vocally the guys were at their WORST.
