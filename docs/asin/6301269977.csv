I greatly admire Maya Plisetskaya's technical and performance abilities and I especially enjoyed seeing her execute the fouette turns with the corps de ballet towards the middle of the DVD.  The film was a bit fuzzy, but the story and music were a joy.  I recommend this for children, especially children studying classical ballet because it shows us that ballet does not have to be stiff, sterile or acrobatic to entertain, as is so often the case now.",4,Humpbacked Horse,1112659200,"04 5, 2005",2005,565,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'Russian', 'folk', 'story', 'one', 'greatest', 'ballerinas', 'ever', 'greatly', 'admire', 'Maya', 'Plisetskaya', 'technical', 'performance', 'abilities', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'execute', 'fouette', 'corps', 'ballet', 'middle', 'DVD', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'fuzzy', 'story', 'music', 'were', 'joy', 'recommend', 'children', 'especially', 'children', 'studying', 'classical', 'ballet', 'ballet', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'stiff', 'sterile', 'acrobatic', 'entertain', 'so', 'often', 'case', 'now']",N/A

In 1961, Maya  Plisetskaya was considered by many to be the greatest ballerina of her  time; Vladimir Vasiliev (now Gen'l &amp; Artistic Director of the Bolshoi)  was a rising young star of the Bolshoi.  Plisetskaya's unusual strength and  flamboyance created a unique presence, and Vasiliev's clean technique and  unmannered style are admirable even by today's standards.  Also very  enjoyable are the Russian folkloric elements of the production, with  wonderful character actors and dancers.",4,Stars shine through.,961113600,"06 16, 2000",2000,694,"['datedness', 'production', 'including', 'primitive', 'animation', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'undersea', 'scene', 'well', 'worth', 'owning', 'dancing', 'charisma', 'two', 'principals', '1961', 'Maya', 'Plisetskaya', 'was', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'greatest', 'ballerina', 'time', 'Vladimir', 'Vasiliev', 'now', 'Gen', 'l', 'amp', 'Artistic', 'Director', 'Bolshoi', 'was', 'rising', 'young', 'star', 'Bolshoi', 'Plisetskaya', 'unusual', 'strength', 'flamboyance', 'created', 'unique', 'presence', 'Vasiliev', 'clean', 'technique', 'unmannered', 'style', 'are', 'admirable', 'even', 'today', 'standards', 'Also', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'Russian', 'folkloric', 'elements', 'production', 'wonderful', 'character', 'actors', 'dancers']",N/A

Folks disregard the low marks from the 1 star  reviewer, and don't be afraid to invest in this ballet, with music by Maya Plisetskaya's husband, Rodion Shchedrin, who wrote and dedicated the music for this ballet to her. Read the review by Expressive Dance Mom, on this listing of Humpbacked Horse, and her comment to the 1 star reviewer. Her remarks are right on. I think you can believe her.I too, think the Little Humpbacked Horse is a very good ballet with some remarkable dancing from the principles. Yes, it's a bit childish, and the animation is a bit crude, but you probably won't find many children complaining about those aspects about it. And, as reviewer, Expressive Dance Mom seems quite enthusiastic about the ballet, most adults won't complain either. Very little of the music is damaged by the voice-overs, and you get to hear some very good music by Shchredrin. If you don't know him, (I didn't when I first started looking for Maya Plisetskaya on DVD), for goodness sake get a copy of their Carmen Suite too. His re-arraingement of Bizet's Carmen is fabulous. You won't believe what he did with only strings and five percussionists......Shchedrin - Carmen Suite / Maya Plistetskaya.....Another thing folks, If you really want to know about this great ballerina, get her autobiography....I, Maya Plisetskaya....And don't be afraid of buying used copies, especially the hardback copies. I found one for less than $10.00 in excellent condition, with many photos. The photo of her on the White House steps w/JFK is one of the saddest faces (hers) I have ever seen. You will understand that sadness after you read about her life in the Soviet Russia. To have been a Prima Ballerina Assoluta of the Bolshoi, she was badly mistreated. Some of that mistreatment was still going on when this ballet was being born. She really caught hell over Carmen Suite. Read about it.I know many of you want good ballets for your children. The reason I know, is because of the number of yes votes I have recieved on my review of Snow White....Arag&oacute;n: Snow White (ballet).... Lots of those votes are coming from people looking for ballets for their children. Buy this ballet for your children. They will love it, and you will too, and HEY, get Snow White too.....Richard.",5,A common man's point of view.,1262563200,"01 4, 2010",2010,2382,"['no-one', 'else', 'dancing', 'ballet', 'one', 'wonders', 'where', 'else', 'one', 'would', 'find', 'copy', 'medium', 'Folks', 'low', 'marks', '1', 'star', 'reviewer', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'invest', 'ballet', 'music', 'Maya', 'Plisetskaya', 'husband', 'Rodion', 'Shchedrin', 'who', 'wrote', 'dedicated', 'music', 'ballet', 'Read', 'review', 'Expressive', 'Dance', 'Mom', 'listing', 'Humpbacked', 'Horse', 'comment', '1', 'star', 'reviewer', 'remarks', 'are', 'right', 'think', 'can', 'believe', 'her.I', 'too', 'think', 'Little', 'Humpbacked', 'Horse', 'very', 'good', 'ballet', 'remarkable', 'dancing', 'principles', 'Yes', 'bit', 'childish', 'animation', 'bit', 'crude', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'many', 'children', 'complaining', 'aspects', 'reviewer', 'Expressive', 'Dance', 'Mom', 'quite', 'enthusiastic', 'ballet', 'most', 'adults', 'wo', ""n't"", 'complain', 'either', 'Very', 'little', 'music', 'damaged', 'voice-overs', 'get', 'hear', 'very', 'good', 'music', 'Shchredrin', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'when', 'first', 'started', 'looking', 'Maya', 'Plisetskaya', 'DVD', 'goodness', 'sake', 'get', 'copy', 'Carmen', 'Suite', 'too', 're-arraingement', 'Bizet', 'Carmen', 'fabulous', 'wo', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'did', 'only', 'strings', 'five', 'percussionists', 'Shchedrin', 'Carmen', 'Suite', '/', 'Maya', 'Plistetskaya', '..Another', 'thing', 'folks', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'great', 'ballerina', 'get', 'autobiography', '.I', 'Maya', 'Plisetskaya', '.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'buying', 'used', 'copies', 'especially', 'hardback', 'copies', 'found', 'one', 'less', '10.00', 'excellent', 'condition', 'many', 'photos', 'photo', 'White', 'House', 'steps', 'w/JFK', 'one', 'saddest', 'hers', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'will', 'understand', 'sadness', 'read', 'life', 'Soviet', 'Russia', 'have', 'been', 'Prima', 'Ballerina', 'Assoluta', 'Bolshoi', 'was', 'badly', 'mistreated', 'mistreatment', 'was', 'still', 'going', 'when', 'ballet', 'was', 'being', 'born', 'really', 'caught', 'hell', 'Carmen', 'Suite', 'Read', 'it.I', 'know', 'many', 'want', 'good', 'ballets', 'children', 'reason', 'know', 'number', 'yes', 'votes', 'have', 'recieved', 'review', 'Snow', 'White', '.Arag', 'oacute', 'Snow', 'White', 'ballet', 'Lots', 'votes', 'are', 'coming', 'people', 'looking', 'ballets', 'children', 'Buy', 'ballet', 'children', 'will', 'love', 'will', 'too', 'HEY', 'get', 'Snow', 'White', 'too', '..Richard']",N/A
248623,A1JEFESGLIS076,6301269977,rsoonsa,"[9, 9]","This ballet, formed from a much beloved as well as archetypal Russian folk tale was created for the Bolshoi Ballet's Maya Plisetskaya by her husband, supremely skillful orchestrator Rodion Shchedrin, composer of the work.  Lissome Plisetskaya's recognized strengths, here as the Queen Maiden, are clearly in evidence throughout the film: matchless elevation, splendidly disciplined movements, and emotional interpretation that covers a wide range.  English ballerina Alicia Markova's published comment that Plisetskaya is incapable of completing foutt&eacute;s is thoroughly discredited as the latter lightly tosses off more than the 32 of these demanding turns that have become traditional in the role of Odile in Le Lac des Cygnes, to which Markova refers.  Plisetskaya is partnered here by a youthful Vladimir Vasiliev, (later both General, and Artistic, Director of the Bolshoi Theatre), whose acrobatic flair as Ivan is on display, his highly accomplished technique nearly matching in worthiness that of the great ballerina.  Partly filmed during an actual performance at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow that utilizes original sets crafted for the piece, the narrative rhythm of the ballet is nearly daunted by an attempt to augment its essentially folkloric elements with primordial animation, in addition to superimposition and uninspiring table top models, but fortunately the narrative and dancing prevail.  The Bolshoi's house Ballet Master, Alexandre Radunsky, not only choreographs and scripts the production, but also plays as the King, and Alla Scherbinina is wonderful as the Little Humpbacked Horse whose conjuring powers are of signal importance to Ivan, while the Bolshoi Corps and soloists are as accomplished as ever in secondary but crucial character parts.  The film has no dialogue as produced by Mosfilm, and certainly none is required, but English language voiceover narration is added by Artkino and accompanies a Kultur release, not in the event inappropriate as it is spare while yet being descriptive of the storyline's progress.  At any rate, all else fades from a viewer's attention when Maya Plisetkaya dances.",5,Unrefined Animation Treatment Fails To Spoil A Balletic Delight.,1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,2140,"['ballet', 'formed', 'much', 'beloved', 'as', 'well', 'archetypal', 'Russian', 'folk', 'tale', 'was', 'created', 'Bolshoi', 'Ballet', 'Maya', 'Plisetskaya', 'husband', 'supremely', 'skillful', 'orchestrator', 'Rodion', 'Shchedrin', 'composer', 'work', 'Lissome', 'Plisetskaya', 'recognized', 'strengths', 'here', 'Queen', 'Maiden', 'are', 'clearly', 'evidence', 'film', 'matchless', 'elevation', 'splendidly', 'disciplined', 'movements', 'emotional', 'interpretation', 'wide', 'range', 'English', 'ballerina', 'Alicia', 'Markova', 'published', 'comment', 'Plisetskaya', 'incapable', 'completing', 'foutt', 'eacute', 'thoroughly', 'discredited', 'latter', 'lightly', 'more', '32', 'demanding', 'turns', 'have', 'become', 'traditional', 'role', 'Odile', 'Le', 'Lac', 'des', 'Cygnes', 'Markova', 'refers', 'Plisetskaya', 'partnered', 'here', 'youthful', 'Vladimir', 'Vasiliev', 'later', 'General', 'Artistic', 'Director', 'Bolshoi', 'Theatre', 'acrobatic', 'flair', 'Ivan', 'display', 'highly', 'accomplished', 'technique', 'nearly', 'matching', 'worthiness', 'great', 'ballerina', 'Partly', 'filmed', 'actual', 'performance', 'Bolshoi', 'Theatre', 'Moscow', 'original', 'sets', 'crafted', 'piece', 'narrative', 'rhythm', 'ballet', 'nearly', 'daunted', 'attempt', 'augment', 'essentially', 'folkloric', 'elements', 'primordial', 'animation', 'addition', 'superimposition', 'uninspiring', 'table', 'top', 'models', 'fortunately', 'narrative', 'dancing', 'prevail', 'Bolshoi', 'house', 'Ballet', 'Master', 'Alexandre', 'Radunsky', 'not', 'only', 'choreographs', 'production', 'also', 'King', 'Alla', 'Scherbinina', 'wonderful', 'Little', 'Humpbacked', 'Horse', 'conjuring', 'powers', 'are', 'signal', 'importance', 'Ivan', 'Bolshoi', 'Corps', 'soloists', 'are', 'as', 'accomplished', 'ever', 'secondary', 'crucial', 'character', 'parts', 'film', 'dialogue', 'produced', 'Mosfilm', 'certainly', 'none', 'required', 'English', 'language', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'added', 'Artkino', 'Kultur', 'release', 'not', 'event', 'inappropriate', 'spare', 'yet', 'being', 'descriptive', 'storyline', 'progress', 'rate', 'else', 'fades', 'viewer', 'attention', 'when', 'Maya', 'Plisetkaya', 'dances']",N/A

I don't know if American children would be able to follow the story since it was done during the era when much of Russian ballet was done for &#34;propaganda.&#34;The bonus is that the main character is performed by a very young Vladimir Vasiliev.  He's probably one of my favorites of the Russian male dancers and to see him interpret this character at a young age is wonderful.  The few scenes that he shares with Mme. Plisetskaya are endearing.On the whole, after you've watched it once, you'll probably skip through a lot of the political action going on in the kingdom where the story takes place.
