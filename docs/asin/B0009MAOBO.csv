908039,A1ELM0GEXEAM79,B0009MAOBO,"Christopher P. Cecena ""ssjanifan""","[9, 9]","After the pathetic joke that was DBZ movie 10, and after hearing so much negative talk about this one, I was a bit worried.  Needless to say, it's not as bad as I thought, and it definitely isn't nearly as bad as the last film.  Still, it's not a movie for every DBZ fan.  First, if you consider this to be one of the more serious.  It's not.  This film is pretty much a pure comedic one.  Heck, the main characters are Goten and Trunks, so there's already a clue it's going to be more humor than anything else.  The plot is also humor-based.  Mr. Satan's jealous cousin blackmails him to visiting his island to face his warriors, or else he'll reveal embarassing secrets about his childhood to the world.  Goten and Trunks tag along, pretty much for the heck of it, and 18 follows as well because she wants Mr. Satan to live up to his promise of paying her for throwing the 25th Tenkaichi Budokai.  Unfortunately, Jaga Bada(said cousin) has a secret weapon: a clone of saiyajin powerhouse Broly.  It turns out one of the movie 10 characters found whatever was left of him after the 10th film and gave it Bada.  Thus, our selection of heroes definitely , especially since there's none of the usual DBZ heavyhitters around this time.Not that it all works out, especially since it is more humor based(a reason I hated the first few arcs in original DB).  Broly's clone, for example, starts out looking like the original, but for some incredibly stupid reason gets taken and turned into a sad rip-off of Swamp Thing.  The way he's defeated is probably even worse than his new design.  There's also a ton of pointless errors as well.  For example, since when does Trunks know the Kamehameha?  The number of errors like these(and there's a lot) pretty much leave this one as a rental at best.Oh well, next year's when things get good, especially after 2005's letdown.  2006 will have both the Fusion movie with Janemba and Gogeta that's been spoiled over and over in the US DBZ video games, as well as my favorite film, Dragon Fist(the movie with Tapion).  Just have patience, because soon we're finally going to see the proverbial cloud's silver lining.",3,If it wasn't for the fact that this was supposed to be a comedy my score would be much lower,1132617600,"11 22, 2005",2005,2149,"['pathetic', 'joke', 'was', 'DBZ', 'movie', '10', 'hearing', 'so', 'much', 'negative', 'talk', 'one', 'was', 'bit', 'worried', 'Needless', 'say', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'thought', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'last', 'film', 'Still', 'not', 'movie', 'DBZ', 'fan', 'First', 'consider', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'serious', 'not', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'pure', 'comedic', 'one', 'Heck', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Goten', 'Trunks', 'already', 'clue', 'going', 'be', 'more', 'humor', 'anything', 'else', 'plot', 'also', 'humor-based', 'Mr.', 'Satan', 'jealous', 'cousin', 'visiting', 'island', 'face', 'warriors', 'else', ""'ll"", 'reveal', 'embarassing', 'secrets', 'childhood', 'world', 'Goten', 'Trunks', 'tag', 'along', 'pretty', 'much', 'heck', '18', 'as', 'well', 'Mr.', 'Satan', 'live', 'up', 'promise', 'paying', 'throwing', '25th', 'Tenkaichi', 'Budokai', 'Unfortunately', 'Jaga', 'Bada', 'said', 'cousin', 'secret', 'weapon', 'clone', 'saiyajin', 'powerhouse', 'Broly', 'out', 'one', 'movie', '10', 'characters', 'found', 'was', 'left', '10th', 'film', 'gave', 'Bada', 'Thus', 'selection', 'heroes', 'definitely', 'especially', 'none', 'usual', 'DBZ', 'heavyhitters', 'time.Not', 'out', 'especially', 'more', 'humor', 'based', 'reason', 'hated', 'first', 'few', 'arcs', 'original', 'DB', 'Broly', 'clone', 'example', 'out', 'looking', 'original', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'reason', 'taken', 'turned', 'sad', 'rip-off', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'way', 'defeated', 'probably', 'even', 'worse', 'new', 'design', 'also', 'ton', 'pointless', 'errors', 'as', 'well', 'example', 'when', 'Trunks', 'know', 'Kamehameha', 'number', 'errors', 'lot', 'pretty', 'much', 'leave', 'one', 'rental', 'best.Oh', 'well', 'next', 'year', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'good', 'especially', '2005', 'letdown', '2006', 'will', 'have', 'Fusion', 'movie', 'Janemba', 'Gogeta', 'been', 'spoiled', 'US', 'DBZ', 'video', 'games', 'as', 'well', 'favorite', 'film', 'Dragon', 'Fist', 'movie', 'Tapion', 'Just', 'have', 'patience', 'soon', ""'re"", 'finally', 'going', 'see', 'proverbial', 'cloud', 'silver', 'lining']",N/A

Sadly that was just not met. In the beginning it starts with this rich cat named Jaguar and how he has scientists genetically engineer warriors and use them to fight against the ""world champ"" hercule. Well knowing hercule most dbz fans would know what he would do if he was challenged so it was kinda interesting to see his reaction to this event. This movie obviously starts right after the world tournament saga and android 18 was just as funny as ever. Of course that was probably why i even gave this movie a 3. Broly does indeed come back to life thanks to the @sshole from the previous movie the stupid village idiot that rambled bs. Because of him the scientists got a hold of brolys blood from his spaceship unfortunately and now he has been resurrected.
