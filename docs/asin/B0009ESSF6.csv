The old ""uncontrollable sex-crazed youth"" has been done to death. A little too much of it in this movie. There were a few disgusting parts (of the movie, I mean), but I guess that is a matter of taste. There is one part at the dinner table, with the farmer and his daughter, that goes beyond the pale. Using the dinner prayer , while the daughter ""does her thing"" kind of soiled the enjoyment for me.  Having said that, a lot of beautiful people trapse up to Canada so the one star crossed ex-virgin can propose to his snobby snooty girlfriend. The sabatoge attempts were ok, but one of the enjoyable parts was that of the characters who played Chritopher Jacots' parents. They did not have enough screentime in this campy yet enjoyable, forgettable movie.The adventers, comedic forays, with just the right amount of ""he should be  with this girl, not the one he thinks he is in love with"" made me give this movie barely a -3-.

904169,A3E5OY3YLZMOA9,B0009ESSF6,"Keith A. Jones ""Sonic Jones... I'm Kind Of A ...","[3, 6]","National Lampoons has always had the ability to put out mixed films. Some are good stupid and some are too stupid to even sit through like their genius movie Adam and Eve, which I turned off after 10 minutes. Here comes Going the distance which actually has some notable moments but most of them I can't write on Amazon. Going the Distance is about a teen named Nick who looks more like a 29 year old. Nick just got a special gift from his girlfriend on the night before she goes off to Toronto to intern for a slimy record executive who likes to take advantage of young interns. His girl doesn't tell him until the next day and Nick has no choice but to let her go.A few hours later Nick decides to fly to Toronto and ask her to marry him but not before his friends and parents (who absolutely hate his girlfriend) force nick to have a few going away drinks. Somehow Nick's mom slips him something to make him pass out and when Nick wakes up he is in his trailer and his friends surprise him by taking a road trip to Toronto.  This movie is actually enjoyable but it could be way better if they picked a couple of better actors. Christopher Jacot playing the lead character Nick doesn't really fit him. I actually would have liked to seen Ryan Reynolds play Nick but he probably had better things to do. Chris was a dry actor for a National Lampoon film and he drops the films worth. The supporting characters were ok but you can feel the need for one more crazy character to boost the movies excitement. There wasn't enough funny stuff going on in this movie, just a little here and a little there. Going the distance is worth seeing if you have nothing else to do and nothing else to watch and you'll definitely get a few laughs, especially on the farmer's table scene.",3,"Keep Going, Your Almost There",1165190400,"12 4, 2006",2006,1772,"['National', 'Lampoons', 'always', 'had', 'ability', 'put', 'out', 'mixed', 'films', 'are', 'good', 'stupid', 'are', 'too', 'stupid', 'even', 'sit', 'genius', 'movie', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'turned', 'off', '10', 'minutes', 'Here', 'Going', 'distance', 'actually', 'notable', 'moments', 'most', 'ca', ""n't"", 'write', 'Amazon', 'Going', 'Distance', 'teen', 'named', 'Nick', 'who', 'more', '29', 'year', 'old', 'Nick', 'just', 'got', 'special', 'gift', 'girlfriend', 'night', 'off', 'Toronto', 'intern', 'slimy', 'record', 'executive', 'who', 'take', 'advantage', 'young', 'interns', 'girl', ""n't"", 'tell', 'next', 'day', 'Nick', 'choice', 'let', 'go.A', 'few', 'hours', 'later', 'Nick', 'fly', 'Toronto', 'ask', 'marry', 'not', 'friends', 'parents', 'who', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'girlfriend', 'force', 'nick', 'have', 'few', 'going', 'away', 'drinks', 'Somehow', 'Nick', 'mom', 'something', 'make', 'pass', 'out', 'when', 'Nick', 'up', 'trailer', 'friends', 'surprise', 'taking', 'road', 'trip', 'Toronto', 'movie', 'actually', 'enjoyable', 'could', 'be', 'way', 'better', 'picked', 'couple', 'better', 'actors', 'Christopher', 'Jacot', 'playing', 'lead', 'character', 'Nick', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'actually', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'seen', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'play', 'Nick', 'probably', 'had', 'better', 'things', 'do', 'Chris', 'was', 'dry', 'actor', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'film', 'films', 'worth', 'supporting', 'characters', 'were', 'ok', 'can', 'feel', 'need', 'one', 'more', 'crazy', 'character', 'boost', 'movies', 'excitement', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'funny', 'stuff', 'going', 'movie', 'just', 'little', 'here', 'little', 'there', 'Going', 'distance', 'worth', 'seeing', 'have', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'nothing', 'else', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'get', 'few', 'laughs', 'especially', 'farmer', 'table', 'scene']",National Lampoon's Going the Distance

I think most viewers, even if they just want dumb fun, will find this movie insulting to their intelligence. I guess maybe it's just a movie to watch while drinking with friends. Your brain would have to be completely turned off to be entertained by it. It's template derived, an endless string of cliches. The kind of script that draws inspiration from other movies rather than from real life or a creative imagination. The basic plot outline of a guy making an emergency trip across the country to save his relationship, while falling for another girl in the process, is ripped off of Road Trip who ripped it off of Overnight Delivery. Only in this movie instead of the other girl being wilder and broadening the guy's horizons she's more conservative, I guess a testament to the conservative mentality behind this film. The added bit of having to save the girlfriend from a sleazy record executive type = Wayne's World. The picking up girls who subject the unwitting guy to violent bondage = Tomcats. The popsickle scene was the only remotely clever part. If it was just the girl licking the popsickle seductively to tease the boy it would be really dumb, but because the guy was doing it too it had a certain inane random charm to it that I liked.It's pretty tragic to think that hundreds of people spent months working on this. The only real problem is the script. It's a professional looking movie as far as the actors and cameras go, but it's all wasted effort because of the weak script. It's like building a mansion on a sinkhole.",2,Please enter a title for your review,1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,1567,"['as', 'bad', 'Out', 'Cold', 'think', 'most', 'viewers', 'even', 'just', 'want', 'dumb', 'fun', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'insulting', 'intelligence', 'guess', 'maybe', 'just', 'movie', 'watch', 'drinking', 'friends', 'brain', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'completely', 'turned', 'off', 'be', 'entertained', 'template', 'derived', 'endless', 'string', 'cliches', 'kind', 'script', 'inspiration', 'other', 'movies', 'rather', 'real', 'life', 'creative', 'imagination', 'basic', 'plot', 'outline', 'guy', 'making', 'emergency', 'trip', 'country', 'save', 'relationship', 'falling', 'girl', 'process', 'ripped', 'Road', 'Trip', 'who', 'ripped', 'Overnight', 'Delivery', 'Only', 'movie', 'instead', 'other', 'girl', 'being', 'wilder', 'broadening', 'guy', 'horizons', 'more', 'conservative', 'guess', 'testament', 'conservative', 'mentality', 'film', 'added', 'bit', 'having', 'save', 'girlfriend', 'sleazy', 'record', 'executive', 'type', '=', 'Wayne', 'World', 'picking', 'up', 'girls', 'who', 'subject', 'unwitting', 'guy', 'violent', 'bondage', '=', 'Tomcats', 'popsickle', 'scene', 'was', 'only', 'remotely', 'clever', 'part', 'was', 'just', 'girl', 'licking', 'popsickle', 'seductively', 'tease', 'boy', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'dumb', 'guy', 'was', 'doing', 'too', 'had', 'certain', 'inane', 'random', 'charm', 'liked.It', 'pretty', 'tragic', 'think', 'hundreds', 'people', 'spent', 'months', 'working', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'script', 'professional', 'looking', 'movie', 'as', 'far', 'actors', 'cameras', 'go', 'wasted', 'effort', 'weak', 'script', 'building', 'mansion', 'sinkhole']",National Lampoon's Going the Distance
