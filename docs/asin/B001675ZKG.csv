1152612,A2Q9D9R1YSA8K5,B001675ZKG,Sheshe30,"[1, 1]",Love this show! It is so sad the shows of today have not exceeded the content or quality of this show. I would like to say R.I.P James Avery. James Avery was a wonderful actor. I was so happy to see him play Damon's father at the start of season 2.  Judge Carter in season 1 had a small part in 1 episode of the season and when I saw him I thought back then why didn't' James Avery for this part. I was so delighted to see James Avery as the replacement. I am glad to have this series on dvd however after watching this DVD series some episodes appeared to be missing some scenes so it is definitely edited in season 2-5. It is not as bad as the versions on BET/Centric. It would have been nice to see extras or deleted scenes. I also wished they would have made all seasons either full screen or wide screen. As another reviewer pointed out the final season is wide screen however the picture is grainy. Stretching the video to appear as widescreen compromised the quality of the picture. I played the disc in my blu-Ray player and I also have an HDTV. The picture was still grainy on the screen. I wish the was an option to buy this series on blu-Ray.  Even with the disc quality compromised in the final season the show deserves 5 stars. The final episode was a bit rushed but at least the fans were given some closure. It would be nice to see a soul food reunion show or perhaps bring back the show with a new cast focusing mostly on the Chadway and Van Adam family since the kids are adults now probably of college age. There is still more to be told about this family of matriarch and patriarchs.,5,Love the show!
