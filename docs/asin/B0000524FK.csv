Watching this again, 24+ years later, I was realy surprised at what I was watching, it was so wierd.  I was almost scared by their strange hollow eyes that seemed to follow me but not see me, and the strange way they spoke almost seems like they were doing a language experiment of some sort.  I was really impressed with how puppets, models, and occasional footage of real people( a hand turning a knob, someone walking down an alley) and combined it with some real wierd dialog to make a facinating and enthralling series that really engages the imagination.",4,Awesome Series!,995932800,"07 24, 2001",2001,645,"['remember', 'watching', 'series', 'kid', 'was', 'awesome', 'then', 'awesome', 'now', 'Watching', 'again', '24+', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'realy', 'surprised', 'what', 'was', 'watching', 'was', 'so', 'wierd', 'was', 'almost', 'scared', 'strange', 'hollow', 'eyes', 'seemed', 'follow', 'not', 'see', 'strange', 'way', 'spoke', 'almost', 'were', 'doing', 'language', 'experiment', 'sort', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'how', 'puppets', 'models', 'occasional', 'footage', 'real', 'people', 'hand', 'turning', 'knob', 'someone', 'walking', 'down', 'alley', 'combined', 'real', 'wierd', 'dialog', 'make', 'facinating', 'enthralling', 'series', 'really', 'imagination']",N/A

Once again, I still find myself dropping everything to sit and watch this fabulous show 35 years after it was originally broadcast (I was 5 yrs old at the time). When I was a kid, you either wanted to be Scott Tracy who piloted Thunderbird 1 (fast rocket, first vehicle to the disaster area), or Virgil Tracy who piloted Thunderbird 2 (fairly fast carrier with some cool rescue stuff stashed away in the pods), or Alan who piloted Thunderbird 3 (space rocket). I don't ever remember any of my friends wanting to pilot Thunderbird 4 (small yellow submarine that didn't do that much) or Thunderbird 5 (space station). My best friend Peter wanted to be Lady Penelope with the Pink Rolls Royce, but that's another story!  Buy the DVD, the picture and sound quality are F.A.B.

And though many of the details of the show were for so long shrouded in the faint rememberings of this true classic, I still did not hesitate to purchase set two the instant I saw it. And I was not disappointed.First of all, the effects are truelly breathtaking in their cheesiness. But that is absolutely the charm of the show. Never mind that you can see the damn strings sticking out of them. Additionally the remastering is first rate. Sound and picture quality are tip top. Possibly better than back in '65, when you consider that they had to watch it sans digital home theater systems! Every episode brings a new, thrilling, and death defying challenge to the indomitable crew that are the Thunderbirds. They're rolling XXX large in their incredible machines that defy the laws of physics, and the limits of the human imagination.Whats more is that they smoke! Cigars, cigarettes, and who knows what else? You will also notice that they not only sweat, constantly; but that mysteriously, they always manage to some how get filthy. It is obvious that the budget was of little issue in the making of this truelly original sci-fi masterpiece, as every special effect will get your heart racing with uncontrolable laughter. I especially liked that from time to time, real human hands and other limbs are used to give some continuity to the story line. Bravo! If you loved this show as a kid, which most of us, of a certain age did... you should also not hesitate a moment in purchasing either, or both sets. It's approx. 312 minutes for both discs, so you will be getting your moneys worth.",5,F.A.B.-tastic!!!,983059200,"02 25, 2001",2001,1742,"['Though', 'born', 'fully', 'one', 'decade', 'series', 'was', 'originally', 'shown', 'brother', 'still', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'watching', 'show', 'children', 'many', 'details', 'show', 'were', 'so', 'long', 'shrouded', 'faint', 'rememberings', 'true', 'classic', 'still', 'did', 'not', 'hesitate', 'purchase', 'set', 'two', 'instant', 'saw', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed.First', 'effects', 'are', 'truelly', 'breathtaking', 'cheesiness', 'absolutely', 'charm', 'show', 'mind', 'can', 'see', 'damn', 'strings', 'sticking', 'Additionally', 'remastering', 'first', 'rate', 'Sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'tip', 'top', 'Possibly', 'better', 'back', ""'65"", 'when', 'consider', 'had', 'watch', 'digital', 'home', 'theater', 'systems', 'episode', 'new', 'thrilling', 'death', 'defying', 'challenge', 'indomitable', 'crew', 'are', 'Thunderbirds', ""'re"", 'rolling', 'XXX', 'large', 'incredible', 'machines', 'defy', 'laws', 'physics', 'limits', 'human', 'imagination.Whats', 'more', 'smoke', 'Cigars', 'who', 'what', 'else', 'will', 'also', 'notice', 'not', 'only', 'sweat', 'constantly', 'mysteriously', 'always', 'manage', 'how', 'get', 'filthy', 'obvious', 'budget', 'was', 'little', 'issue', 'making', 'truelly', 'original', 'sci-fi', 'masterpiece', 'special', 'effect', 'will', 'get', 'heart', 'racing', 'uncontrolable', 'laughter', 'especially', 'liked', 'time', 'time', 'real', 'human', 'hands', 'other', 'limbs', 'are', 'used', 'give', 'continuity', 'story', 'line', 'Bravo', 'loved', 'show', 'kid', 'most', 'certain', 'age', 'did', 'should', 'also', 'not', 'hesitate', 'moment', 'purchasing', 'sets', 'approx', '312', 'minutes', 'discs', 'will', 'be', 'getting', 'moneys', 'worth']",N/A
564820,A3M4QGREWR0Z3O,B0000524FK,"Michael Daly ""Monkeesfan""","[3, 3]","The second half-dozen episodes of Thunderbirds are available on DVD and they encompass several of the series' best moments.Vault of Death - A more comedic-oriented episode than usual, it details Lady Penelope and Parker's break-in at the Bank of England - designed to prove to the bank's officials the need for more modern vaults - but the ensuing change may kill an absent-minded employee, who becomes trapped in a high-tech vault programmed to purge out all the air inside.The strongest aspect of this episode is that it delves into Parker's past and gives the viewer a look at the man and helps explain how he became who he presently is.Operation Crashdive - A sequel to the series pilot, to which there is a reference in a newscast about the crash of a Fireflash airliner. Additional such craft are mysteriously crashing, and IR must deduce the reason why - to the point that Scott must fly a Fireflash craft with Captain Hanson, the pilot of the first Fireflash.  This episode also features one of the best ""intro"" shots of the series as Fireflash taxis out of its form-fitting hangar in Act IV underscored by one of Barry Gray's most powerful cues.Move And You're Dead - This episode is told almost entirely in flashback, and the use of the technique by writer-director Alan Patillo is strikingly effective. Alan and Grandma are kidnapped by a jealous racecar driver and left on a bridge with a bomb and motion detector - the motion detector will detonate the bomb if the two prisoners try to escape.  Jeff and tinTin must talk Alan through retelling his story while Scott and Virgil fly to the area.Martian Invasion - The Hood uses his hypnotic power over the Tracys' manservant Kyrano to shut off camera detectors about Thunderbird One, and then uses a sci-fi movie as cover to lure IR to the Nevada desert, where he films them in action for a mysterious international general. The premise is good and well presented, especially the chase in the third and fourth acts, but there are some plot holes and the denoument of the chase is too comedic, an uncharacteristic failing of the show's best writer, Alan Fennell.Brink of Disaster - Basically two unrelated plots in this Fennell script are tied together by the central premise of Warren Grafton, a monorail executive in need of a big infusion of quick cash to finance his US-based monorail system, a system overly dependent on automated train systems and a fleet of patrolling hoverjets, one of which crashes and severs an overhanging section of track. The episode's subplot involves thieves with Grafton's company who break into Penelope's home to steal her valuable collection of jewels to finance Grafton's business. This aspect appears more an effort to kill time than a believeable subplot, as the train-crash angle does not contain enough screentime to fill out an hour-long format.The Perils Of Penelope - Penny gets involved with the kidnapping of a famed scientist, and it is up to IR to find them amid the blackness of a monorail tunnel in Switzerland.  The episode used two directors, Alan Patillo and Desmond Saunders, perhaps because of the extensive use of footage from the Saunders-directed episode Sunprobe at the beginning - which suggests Sunprobe and Perils were filmed simultaneously.",4,From The Vault Of Death To The Perils Of Penelope,998697600,"08 25, 2001",2001,3263,"['second', 'half-dozen', 'episodes', 'Thunderbirds', 'are', 'available', 'DVD', 'encompass', 'several', 'series', 'best', 'moments.Vault', 'Death', 'more', 'comedic-oriented', 'episode', 'usual', 'details', 'Lady', 'Penelope', 'Parker', 'break-in', 'Bank', 'England', 'designed', 'prove', 'bank', 'officials', 'need', 'more', 'modern', 'vaults', 'ensuing', 'change', 'may', 'kill', 'absent-minded', 'employee', 'who', 'trapped', 'high-tech', 'vault', 'programmed', 'purge', 'out', 'air', 'inside.The', 'strongest', 'aspect', 'episode', 'Parker', 'past', 'viewer', 'look', 'man', 'explain', 'how', 'became', 'who', 'presently', 'is.Operation', 'Crashdive', 'sequel', 'series', 'pilot', 'reference', 'newscast', 'crash', 'Fireflash', 'airliner', 'Additional', 'such', 'craft', 'are', 'mysteriously', 'crashing', 'IR', 'must', 'deduce', 'reason', 'why', 'point', 'Scott', 'must', 'fly', 'Fireflash', 'craft', 'Captain', 'Hanson', 'pilot', 'first', 'Fireflash', 'episode', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'intro', 'shots', 'series', 'Fireflash', 'taxis', 'form-fitting', 'hangar', 'Act', 'IV', 'underscored', 'one', 'Barry', 'Gray', 'most', 'powerful', 'cues.Move', ""'re"", 'Dead', 'episode', 'told', 'almost', 'entirely', 'flashback', 'use', 'technique', 'writer-director', 'Alan', 'Patillo', 'strikingly', 'effective', 'Alan', 'Grandma', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'jealous', 'racecar', 'driver', 'left', 'bridge', 'bomb', 'motion', 'detector', 'motion', 'detector', 'will', 'detonate', 'bomb', 'two', 'prisoners', 'try', 'escape', 'Jeff', 'tinTin', 'must', 'talk', 'Alan', 'retelling', 'story', 'Scott', 'Virgil', 'fly', 'area.Martian', 'Invasion', 'Hood', 'hypnotic', 'power', 'Tracys', 'manservant', 'Kyrano', 'shut', 'off', 'camera', 'detectors', 'Thunderbird', 'One', 'then', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'cover', 'lure', 'IR', 'Nevada', 'desert', 'where', 'films', 'action', 'mysterious', 'international', 'general', 'premise', 'good', 'well', 'presented', 'especially', 'chase', 'third', 'fourth', 'acts', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'denoument', 'chase', 'too', 'comedic', 'uncharacteristic', 'failing', 'show', 'best', 'writer', 'Alan', 'Fennell.Brink', 'Disaster', 'Basically', 'two', 'unrelated', 'plots', 'Fennell', 'script', 'are', 'tied', 'together', 'central', 'premise', 'Warren', 'Grafton', 'monorail', 'executive', 'need', 'big', 'infusion', 'quick', 'cash', 'finance', 'US-based', 'monorail', 'system', 'system', 'overly', 'dependent', 'automated', 'train', 'systems', 'fleet', 'patrolling', 'hoverjets', 'one', 'crashes', 'severs', 'overhanging', 'section', 'track', 'episode', 'subplot', 'thieves', 'Grafton', 'company', 'who', 'break', 'Penelope', 'home', 'steal', 'valuable', 'collection', 'jewels', 'finance', 'Grafton', 'business', 'aspect', 'more', 'effort', 'kill', 'time', 'believeable', 'subplot', 'train-crash', 'angle', 'not', 'contain', 'enough', 'screentime', 'fill', 'out', 'hour-long', 'format.The', 'Perils', 'Penelope', 'Penny', 'involved', 'kidnapping', 'famed', 'scientist', 'IR', 'find', 'blackness', 'monorail', 'tunnel', 'Switzerland', 'episode', 'used', 'two', 'directors', 'Alan', 'Patillo', 'Desmond', 'Saunders', 'perhaps', 'extensive', 'use', 'footage', 'Saunders-directed', 'episode', 'Sunprobe', 'beginning', 'Sunprobe', 'Perils', 'were', 'filmed', 'simultaneously']",N/A
