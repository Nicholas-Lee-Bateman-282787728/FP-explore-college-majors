Most any of these guys have carried whole movies by themselves in the past, so it's pretty cool to see them all together in one movie, wise-cracking each other with funny one-liners like bunch of brothers!The actual plot of the movie is just OK...not much to it. Clearly this movie is more of a vehicle to pay tribute to all the great action stars of the '80's and '90's...at least that's how I view it. There just isn't enough ""movie to go around"" to really make good use of all the stars...lol. Just seeing how they interact with each other is the real entertainment value, for me. Pretty good fight scenes, but again, not enough to go around. :-)One reviewer makes fun of the amount of total plastic surgery performed amonst all the cast, who he called ""aging movie stars."" Well, I'd be fine looking like Van Damme or Stallone when I'm their age!

Who has the charisma and style (even if most of them aren't top-notch actors...lol) these days that these guys have? Again, I look at this movie as a tribute to all the great 80's action movies, which, thanks to technology, we're all able to still enjoy in the form of DVD and Blu Ray!So yeah, not a real in-depth storyline to this movie, but there's still plenty of action and mega-macho attitude to satisfy anyone! Some think this sequel is better than the first, but I think the first one is better, to be honest.

It isn't going to make you wake up and change your life or want to change the world. It might make you want to lift weights, get buff and learn some martial arts moves, but other than that, it isn't life changing.What this movie is is fun.It is an old-time shoot 'em up, kill the bad guys, we're the good guys movie. Period. The action is non-stop. The dialog is laughable, but they meant for it to be. Sylvester Stallone and his buddies are having fun with their respective legacies and if you've watched &#34;Rambo&#34; and &#34;Die Hard&#34; and &#34;Terminator&#34;, et cetera, then you will recognize a lot of this action and dialog. That is what makes it fun. These guys aren't done. They're not dead and they still have something to give audiences. While this isn't even the best action-flick I've ever seen, the nostalgia for what these actors have given us in the past wins the day.I have to give a nod to Liam Hemsworth. He did a good job in this movie. I wish there had been more of him. I've only seen him in the &#34;Hunger Games&#34; movies and &#34;The Last Song&#34; (which should be expunged from all record. Every copy of the movie and book should be confiscated, burned and the memory of it all should be burned out of our memories. Worst. Movie. Ever.) Needless to say, I haven't been a fan, but he's good in this, and cute, and affable.The best moments of the movie belong to Chuck Norris. I wish I could have seen this in the theater because I have a feeling that the reaction would have been worth it! I know it was a hit at my house. It is so sad that the man cannot act, but he did a great job being Chuck Norris in this movie.I was surprised at the lack of foul language. There were words, yes, but nothing on the scale of what you'd see in most movies of this type, or even on cable. Not a clean movie, but not so foul that you can't filter. I appreciate that. As I said before, the dialog was laughable, but it wasn't so filled with F*bombs that it made the movie experience miserable.This is an action flick. There are plenty of fights, plenty of guns, plenty of blood. But I really think the whole thing was somehow toned down. I had to laugh. Of course, the bad guys can't shoot for nothing. When the good guys shoot, the bad guys just fall down. The stunt men must have had to learn how to fall badly. I've seen worse blood baths on TV and in the movies. This movie isn't for kids, but older teens and adults will not be turned off by blood and gore.Sylvester Stallone knows a good thing when he's got it. There is an Expendables 3 in post production and an Expendables 4 in pre-production. I'm looking forward to it. I will make a point to rent them when they come out on DVD. I don't live near a movie theater, so that isn't a judgment about seeing it in the theater vs. renting on DVD. It's that way with all movies.For whatever reason, Amazon has me reviewing the HD version of the movie. I can't stream HD. I rent in SD. I do not own this film yet. I watched it for free on Amazon Prime in SD. If you need a technical review of that streaming process, the video and the sound quality of HD, I can't give that to you. This review of about content only.This movie is Fun. It did what it was intended to do. It entertained me, my family and some of my kids' friends for the duration of the movie and beyond. We laughed about some of those scenes for a couple of days.  It's worth a look, especially now since it is free on Amazon Prime. Not a Prime member?

1481673,A29QM4M1KVTWVF,B005LAII58,Bitter Bunny,"[0, 0]","Growing up with my brother in the 80's, we watched any action film we could get our hands on be it hand to hand combat or martial arts - we watched all the `bigger than life' characters who could never be defeated, names like Charles Bronson, Sho Kosugi, Bruce Lee, Sylvester Stallone, Kurt Russell, Steven Seagal, Rutger Hauer, Brandon Lee, Van Damme, and so on. Eventually, when we switched the television off and the glow on its face faded away, we asked the questions only boys would think of -  in a fight between Chuck Norris and Van Damme, who would win? Etc. etc. It was fun to think about the factors involved, the risks, strengths and weaknesses, etc. There were various films made to answer this question, say a fight between Snipes and Stallone in Demolition Man or Lundgren versus Van Damme in Universal Soldier. It was our version of watching two giant Japanese monsters duke it out on the streets of Japan, and it was awesome.It's been many years since I was a boy and when I first heard about the idea of The Expendables (a huge, colossal, mega-starred spectacle) my heart did somersaults! I couldn't fathom the concept yet hoped people (agents, studios, directors, film choreographers) could all put their egos aside and actually produce an epic balls out event fit for the giant screen! Was it a success? Yes and no.While the Expendable films will never match what a boy's imagination conjures up, it did well to become reality. That, in itself is worth gold, and while shootings, stabbings, beheadings, etc. aren't everyone's cup of tea, this movie represents a genre that most males connect with and will find some comfort in - there are certain rules you don't break like banging your best friend's girl or cheating a bud out of shared riches. The buddy theme is alive and well in this film and explores the concept of being part of something special; the fact that someone has your back no matter how difficult the odds are and will stand by you is something risking your life for. To quote Kenny Rogers - sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man. But to make this point clear, these guys aren't 'good guys' in the classic vein - When you deal with revenge, it's about standing up to the injustices of the world/bullies yet these mercenaries do have a conscience - it's hard to imagine them taking on a job they know would hurt their country, for instance.The filmmakers did a great job of crafting fight scenes that highlighted each person's skills such as Jet Li's scene - too bad he doesn't stick around for too much of the film. Some of the editing is a bit rough as we're not fully given the opportunity to absorb some of the heartwarming (to call them that) moments before we're thrust into another action sequence. Still, the overall product did not make it feel like different movies were spliced together willy nilly. If I have one caveat, it's the one-liners. I'm not opposed to them - think of action sequences as the long part of an exclamation point, and a one-liner as the dot! The one line that has been sorely over-used is Schwarzenegger's line from `The Terminator' - ""I'll be back."" Some of the best lines (and moments) occur when the characters affirm they're not spring chickens anymore. I applaud them for poking fun at themselves, almost forgive the few crappy 1 liners.Bottom line: You should know the strength of a film like this is not going to be its story/screenplay, so if you can look past this fact and enjoy a plethora of action stunts/fights and macho attitude, you can't go wrong. I do recommend tightening the storyline for the next installment or these guys will expire before they've reached their new prime. Perhaps, they could give us a back story on how different characters met. Too bad David Carradine is 6 feet under.

1481691,AD2DDHLD6FRFM,B005LAII58,Brad Baker,"[2, 3]","2010's ""The Expendables"" was directed by star Sylvester Stallone. It was a fun movie. For ""Expendables 2"", Stallone moves over(he's the star), and the director is action-veteran Simon West. More fun. ""Expendables 2"" did only $84 million in the U.S., but overseas ticket sales broke $300 million. Can you say No. 3? ""Expendables 2"" offers our noble, grizzled action stars re-united by Mr. Church(Bruce Willis) for what looks like an easy plunder-paycheck(They think). A new rookie member is gunned down right in front of the group, and an angry quest for revenge leads to a series of bloody confrontations. Tough-guy Chuck Norris shows up in the middle of the movie for a violent battle, filmed on what looks like the Warners' back lot. Chuck Norris promptly kicks everybody's butt. ""Grandfather"" action stars also include Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Jet Li, and Dolph Lundgren. In one scene, Schwarzenegger demands a rocket-gun being held by the big black man. The big dude says: ""You better not mess with my gun, or you'll be terminated"". Not missing a beat, Arnold says: ""You should be so lucky...""West shoots on location in China, Hong Kong, Louisiana, and The Devetaki Cave, in Bulgaria. A light-hearted adventure, ""Expendables 2"" is lots of inside jokes and huff-and-puff humor. DVD extras include Blue-Ray 1080p hi-def, and DTS-HD Master Audio. The DVD is a beautiful anamorphic transfer with 5.1 Dolby Digital audio. You also get commentary with director Simon West, ""Gods of War; Earth's Anti-Action Heroes"" featurette, ""Big Guns, Rise of the Action Film"" featurette, ""Assault: Real-Life Weaponry of The Expendables"" featurette, ""Guns for Hire"" featurette, Deleted Scenes, and a Gag Reel. Our ageing band of ""tough guys"" all fare well. All except, perhaps, Governor Schwarzenegger. In so many scenes, his hair is fluffed-up and messy! He looks like he just got out of bed with the maid.

He'll probably kick my butt for saying this, but he is a very handsome man. Why girls are drooling over One Direction and Justine Bieber, and not Chuck Norris is beyond me.

1481739,A31ATJR2RAVD5G,B005LAII58,Christopher Engel,"[1, 1]","Look, the appeal of this film could not be any more obvious. But if you're somehow, for whatever psychotic reason, on the fence about seeing it, just read this paragraph and answer the question that follows:Sylvester Stallone, Chuck Norris, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Jason Statham, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Bruce Willis walk into a room with lots of things that can explode. They shoot everything in the room while cracking amusing one-liners at each other, quite a few in-jokes, and totally absurd noise and action. Jean-Claude Van Damme has a one-on-one showdown with Stallone at one point.I just described exactly what the point of this movie is in three sentences. There is nothing else that needs to be said. So, ask yourself, does this scenario appeal to you, or are you of such astoundingly poor judgment that you expected something different, much in the same way someone looking at a clear day would expect a sky colored something other than blue? If yes, great. Ignore everyone else and go see it, you'll be entertained. If not, you're so narcissistic you never would have liked this film to begin with at any point, and your ego is eating itself if you give this film a poor review on grounds it never promised in the first place.The only real problem in this film is that it's lacking in the Jet Li department. Which is really unfortunate, as he was great in the first one. Not sure what happened there, but he's not around for most of the film, which sort of sucks. So if you're here to see Li and to not see him would make you cry regardless of anything else, you should not watch this film.That's as deep as it goes. If you saw it by choice, then you expected correctly what the film was going to deliver all along. If you expected differently, short of being deceived by someone else who lied about what the COVER was about, then it's very likely that you're suffering from a severe psychosis and could benefit from treatment. You're also probably a harsh critic of the Transformers films and referred to them as ""dumb action flicks"" as an insult. This is an added indication that you should never review anything, ever again, because you've failed to develop the basic cognitive ability to know that people can enjoy exactly those films, and your opinion on movies may as well be a review on how provolone cheese is better than Swiss cheese.

1481759,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005LAII58,C. Sawin,"[1, 2]","""The Expendables 2"" is only more of what you received with the first blockbuster film. It's definitely bigger with the introduction of new cast members such as Liam Hemsworth, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Scott Adkins, and Chuck Norris and bigger roles for Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis, but is it better? How can a sequel and its predecessor bring together so many action stars and yet still leave so much to be desired? Somehow ""The Expendables 2"" tops the first movie in the sense that it leaves you with a craving for something a lot more satisfying.""The Expendables 2"" was originally built around the death of Tool (Mickey Rourke) and Barney and his team getting revenge because of it. Well when Rourke suddenly pulled out for another project, that load was dumped onto Billy the Kid (Liam Hemsworth). The problem is you only get to know the character for approximately ten minutes before they pull the trigger. While Billy does manage to squeeze in a story about Afghanistan, another one about getting back to his girlfriend in France, and seems to have a father-son relationship with Barney, there isn't much of an impact since his character feels like the last minute replacement that it is.The writing isn't any better this time around. Sylvester Stallone is more than likely to blame as he should probably stick to acting and directing rather than chipping in with the screenplay. These guys say the most trivial and clich&eacute; one-liners you could possibly think of. ""See you later, alligator,"" and ""Looks like somebody had a bad day,"" are just a few examples. The motivations of several characters are really blurred, as well. Chuck Norris enters the picture as Booker, a sniper who claims that he only works alone and is a ""lone wolf."" Then later shows up to help out Barney and his group again solely because, ""Oh. Well, sometimes it's more fun to run with the pack."" The Church (Bruce Willis) character is the worst offender. He and Barney obviously have a history together, but in the first half of the movie he's rather villainous. He throws Barney and his team right into harm's way because Barney owes Church $5 million. Church threatens Barney and basically blackmails him into this mission. But then at the end of the movie, he helps Barney and they're good buddies by the final scene.Speaking of Church, his back and forth with Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is also near unbearable. Schwarzenegger already made light of his ""I'm back!"" catchphrase in ""Terminator 3,"" so hearing him do it over and over again here is like beating a dead horse. Then Bruce Willis decides to say it and Arnold replies with, ""Yippee ki yay,"" before throwing in a ""Rambo"" reference a moment later. It just feels so elementary.Donnie Yen was originally offered a role in this film, but turned it down. So obviously Jet Li is going to pick up the slack, right? Nope, he bows out of the film after the first ten minutes. He does manage to throw in a pretty entertaining action sequence with frying pans before he leaves though. Scott Adkins is a martial arts actor who's finally managing to pick up steam. He's more than capable of putting on a good show, but doesn't get a chance to here. You also want to see more of Van Damme, but he's dealt with rather suddenly after only delivering two of his patented jumping roundhouse kicks. Speaking of Van Damme, his character's name is Vilain. How much thought was put into that?There are very few positives with ""The Expendables 2."" Jason Statham has a few entertaining action sequences, but you're left wondering why one of those scenes couldn't have gone to somebody else. Dolph Lundgren's Gunnar character takes facts from his actual background like having a master's degree in engineering and even gets a bit more screen time. Aside from the opening sequence, which outdoes every explosive sequence in the first movie, explosions aren't as frequent this time around. Most of the action lies within people's heads being blown off or fistfights that never seem to last as long as you want them to.""The Expendables 2"" is only ""bigger and better"" in the sense that there are bigger additions to the cast, meatier roles for returning actors, and the amount of bullet casings collected when it's all said and done. But the downside is ""The Expendables 2"" is almost more of a letdown than the original movie. The dialogue is worse, character motivations are blurred, and the storyline is beyond simple. It's really only a great movie at face value because when you take a step back and realize how bad it is, you'll be left asking yourself how you gather this many well known stars in two movies and still manage to screw it up twice.In one of the special features, Sylvester Stallone talks about things being more grounded in ""The Expendables 2."" He says that the first film was kind of all over the place in terms of character development and it was left up in the air on whether everyone was trying to be serious or slightly lighthearted at times. Stallone mentions that having that many big stars in one picture got to him the first time around and that it's better-rounded in the sequel. Maybe it is, but it still feels like Stallone is blinded by the dense fog that is made up of all these stars coming together. Everyone is just goofy as hell all the time and Barney and Christmas act like an old married couple. There's a difference in tapping into that same cheesiness that made up nearly every strand of DNA in action films of the 80s and 90s and overdoing it. ""The Expendables 2"" gets way too carried away with that aspect and dives into overkill territory more often than not.Special features on the Blu-ray edition of the film include Audio Commentary with director Simon West, the 21-minute ""Gods of War: Assembling Earth's Mightiest Anti-Heroes,"" the 25-minute ""Big Guns, Bigger Heroes: The 1980s and the Rise of the Action Film,"" the 14-minute ""On

1481766,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B005LAII58,DanD,"[8, 11]","WARNING: If you did not like the first EXPENDABLES, or had no desire to see it, or do not like cliched 80's action films, you will NOT enjoy THE EXPENDABLES 2.  Just so you know.I'm not going to recite any plot points here; the plot makes absolutely no sense.  Something about uranium and a villain (named Vilain, yup), and our gang of lovable misfits gets in the way, losing  one of their own in the process (and not much surprise who gets it, either).  Stallone decides that it's payback time (""Find 'em, track 'em, kill 'em""), and the boys team up with some other major muscle-bound Neanderthals to take their vengeance.  Oh, and save the world or something.Here are the negative things about THE EXPENDABLES 2: Jason Statham's presence is smaller (though still prominent), which cuts down on the chemistry between him and Stallone that helped make the first film so enjoyable.  Same with Jet Li.  Also, Randy Couture is back; he's likable, but he doesn't have nearly as much screen presence as his comrades (though he's better here than in the first film).Now, here are the good things, or at least some of them: the film is hilarious.  Absolutely hilarious.  Chuck Norris reciting a Chuck Norris fact hilarious (and yes, Norris, as well as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis, have significant screen time here).  It's almost a parody, without going over-the-top in the way of AIRPLANE! and NAKED GUN.  It's as much an homage to the classic actioner as anything, right down to its two-dimensional villain: Jean-Claude Van Damme, riding an impressive (if shallow) career comeback.  Van Damme isn't mind-blowing amazing, but damn if he doesn't bring a sly sinister something to the role (as well as an impressive physicality).  Scott Adkins is a welcome addition to the villainous side, while Nan Yu provides a femme fatale presence, and Liam Hemsworth brings some surprising depth to the role of a rookie sniper.  Also, Dolph Lundgren is back with a larger role (and even a small nod to the fact he actually has a Master's in chemical engineering, if you can swallow that).  Stallone hands over directing credit to Simon West, who's proven his action worth with CON AIR and THE MECHANIC, and the change is welcome: West lets loose a little more, plays the game with more attention to wit and humor.  (Scenes between Willis and Schwarzenegger are particularly delightful.)The true draw of THE EXPENDABLES 2 is to see all of these icons in one place, doing their thing, pretty much as bad (take that how you will) as ever.  It's truly an enjoyable film; it really is.  It's intentionally funny--I've rarely seen a theater laugh so hard--and yet doesn't skimp on the action at all.  Perhaps it puts too much weight on some people not known for their acting prowess--again, Statham, who actually CAN act when required, is sorely missed in certain scenes--but that's okay, because just as soon as you begin to question how these people got into this business, Chuck Norris emerges and saves the day.  The gist: If you love class action movies, and I mean love them so much you can't help but admire even the ""bad"" ones, then THE EXPENDABLES 2 is a must-have for your testosterone-fueled collection.",5,"Yeah, they're back.",1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,3200,"['WARNING', 'did', 'not', 'first', 'EXPENDABLES', 'had', 'desire', 'see', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'cliched', '80', 'action', 'films', 'will', 'NOT', 'enjoy', 'THE', 'EXPENDABLES', '2', 'Just', 'so', 'know.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'recite', 'plot', 'points', 'here', 'plot', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'Something', 'uranium', 'villain', 'named', 'Vilain', 'yup', 'gang', 'lovable', 'misfits', 'way', 'losing', 'one', 'own', 'process', 'not', 'much', 'surprise', 'who', 'either', 'Stallone', 'payback', 'time', 'Find', 'track', 'kill', 'boys', 'team', 'up', 'other', 'major', 'muscle-bound', 'Neanderthals', 'take', 'vengeance', 'Oh', 'save', 'world', 'are', 'negative', 'things', 'THE', 'EXPENDABLES', '2', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'presence', 'smaller', 'still', 'prominent', 'down', 'chemistry', 'Stallone', 'helped', 'make', 'first', 'film', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'Same', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Also', 'Randy', 'Couture', 'back', 'likable', ""n't"", 'have', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'screen', 'presence', 'comrades', 'better', 'here', 'first', 'film', '.Now', 'here', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'least', 'film', 'hilarious', 'Absolutely', 'hilarious', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'reciting', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'fact', 'hilarious', 'yes', 'Norris', 'as', 'well', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'have', 'significant', 'screen', 'time', 'here', 'almost', 'parody', 'going', 'over-the-top', 'way', 'AIRPLANE', 'NAKED', 'GUN', 'as', 'much', 'homage', 'classic', 'actioner', 'anything', 'right', 'down', 'two-dimensional', 'villain', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'riding', 'impressive', 'shallow', 'career', 'comeback', 'Van', 'Damme', ""n't"", 'mind-blowing', 'amazing', 'damn', ""n't"", 'bring', 'sly', 'sinister', 'something', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'impressive', 'physicality', 'Scott', 'Adkins', 'welcome', 'addition', 'villainous', 'side', 'Nan', 'Yu', 'femme', 'fatale', 'presence', 'Liam', 'Hemsworth', 'surprising', 'depth', 'role', 'rookie', 'sniper', 'Also', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'back', 'larger', 'role', 'even', 'small', 'nod', 'fact', 'actually', 'Master', 'chemical', 'engineering', 'can', 'swallow', 'Stallone', 'directing', 'credit', 'Simon', 'West', 'who', 'proven', 'action', 'worth', 'CON', 'AIR', 'THE', 'MECHANIC', 'change', 'welcome', 'West', 'lets', 'loose', 'little', 'more', 'game', 'more', 'attention', 'wit', 'humor', 'Scenes', 'Willis', 'Schwarzenegger', 'are', 'particularly', 'delightful', 'true', 'draw', 'THE', 'EXPENDABLES', '2', 'see', 'icons', 'one', 'place', 'doing', 'thing', 'pretty', 'much', 'bad', 'take', 'how', 'will', 'ever', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'really', 'intentionally', 'funny', ""'ve"", 'rarely', 'seen', 'theater', 'laugh', 'so', 'hard', 'yet', ""n't"", 'skimp', 'action', 'Perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'weight', 'people', 'not', 'known', 'acting', 'prowess', 'again', 'Statham', 'who', 'actually', 'CAN', 'act', 'when', 'required', 'sorely', 'missed', 'certain', 'scenes', 'okay', 'because', 'just', 'as', 'soon', 'begin', 'question', 'how', 'people', 'got', 'business', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'emerges', 'day', 'gist', 'love', 'class', 'action', 'movies', 'mean', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'admire', 'even', 'bad', 'ones', 'then', 'THE', 'EXPENDABLES', '2', 'must-have', 'testosterone-fueled', 'collection']",N/A

If you've seen the first film and enjoyed its larger-than-life salute to big 80's action stars then you know exactly what you should expect from the sequel.  It's more of the same formula: Big on star power machismo, ammunition, and one-liners and simple on plot, exposition and intelligence.  The bottom line is; you don't watch The Expendables expecting any Academy Award winning performances.  If this doesn't sound like kind of movie that you would normally enjoy watching then you came to the wrong party.The Boys are BACK: Sylvester Stallone as Barney Ross, Jason Statham as Lee Christmas, Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jensen, Terry Crews as Hale Caesar, Randy Couture as Toll Road and Jet Li as Yin Yang while Mickey Rourke is out as Tool but the testosterone meter is still off the charts.  Liam Hemsworth joins the team as the youngest ""expendable"" Bill the Kid.  The Expendables have been recruited by Church to stop weapons-grade plutonium hidden in a Albanian mine during the Cold War from falling into the wrong hands and it's time to bring in the Dirtier Dozen.The muscle and all-star power are man-uped the second time around.  There's much more Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis this time who only appeared in smaller cameo roles as Trench and Church in the first film and there's more iconic 80's action stars that the fans have been begging to see like Chuck Norris as Booker a.k.a. the ""Lone Wolf"" and Jean Claude Van Damme as Vilain, and what an apropos ""villain"" he makes.  It seems Steven Seagal is still the odd man out due to a publicized disagreement with the producer Avi Lerner, although when asked if he would be in Expendables 3 his response was ""We'll see.""  Rumor has it that Clint Eastwood and Harrison Ford have already been approached for the third one as well with plans to acquire Nicholas Cage and Wesley Snipes to the Expendables 3 dossier.Expendables 2 is a blast if you can appreciate it for what it is; it's the guiltiest kind of guilty pleasure and it makes no apologies for being what it is.  The first one feels almost like a dress rehearsal but the sequel is bigger and a lot more fun.  There are hilarious one-liners and bad puns aplenty and the chemistry between these legendary screen icons takes badassery to a whole new cinematic level.

It's not bad.  ""The Expendables 2"" is entertaining, rolls with its own punches, and stacks one outrageous action scene after another on the audience, helped along by an unending parade of cameos by Jet Li, Chuck Norris, Arnold Schwarzenagger, Bruce, Willis, and Jean-Claude Vandamme, among others.The exotic opening sequence has a group of aging mercenaries known as the Expendables rescuing a Chinese millionaire from a rebel camp in Nepal.  Afterwards, they celebrate, led by crew boss Barney Ross (Slyvester Stallone).  Their next mission is a CIA tasking to retrieve a mysterious package, accompanied by a female minder named Maggie.  The retrieval goes badly, a member of Barney's crew gets killed, and the crew decides to seek revenge.  The final confrontation with a group of nasty mercenaries in a remote airport is part action thriller and part a collection of sight gags, as stars and former stars wander in and out of frame.The violence is practically continuous but fortunately manages to be mostly over the top, along with most of the acting.

Granted, studios didn't begin pumping them out in the `80's, but, to a large part, they experienced a significant retooling in that bygone era.  Mostly, this renaissance was fueled by the big budget star - think Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Damme, and Arnold Schwarzenegger - coming aboard a particular action vehicle and asking for the part to be customized to what his fans had come to expect.  In many cases, this only served to strengthen the picture, as the hero would be put through his paces in such a manner that maximized entertainment value.  However, the action picture kinda/sorta suffered in the long run because too many pictures plucked from the same wellspring of inspiration has the cumulative (over time) of thinning out the premises.  Pictures started to resemble one another, and - even worse - catch phrases became horribly predictable with each passing 90-minute flick.  Still, while the formula worked, it was a doozy, so who can blame Stallone and his cohorts for leaping back into the ring for another go-round?(NOTE: the following review will contain minor spoilers necessary for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you prefer your reviews largely spoiler-free, then feel free to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If you're okay with some basic explanations and hints of things to come, then read on.)Church (played by Bruce Willis) pulls the Expendables back into action in order to settle a lingering old score with Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone).  However, he insists that the team incorporate Maggie (Nan Yu) as a vault specialist to recover a secret map that conceals weapons' grade Plutonium.  However, Vilain (Jean-Claude Van Damme) has other plans for the materials, and, when he kills the youngest member of the Expendables crew (Liam Hemsworth in a brief appearance), the mission becomes a race against time to save the world from a lunatic with aspirations of a nuclear weapon.Now, for the record, let me just clarify right away that the best thing about EXPENDABLES 2 is the fact that action fans are finally treated to some quality screen time shared by three film legends: Stallone, Schwarzenegger, and Willis.  They've long been rumored to be friends off-screen, and there's nothing - NOTHING - that can ever replace seeing them together, working together, shooting guns together (at the bad guys), and dispensing their own respective brands of justice.  It's that fuel that makes this franchise burn, and burn brightly.  Add Jason Statham to the mix, and you should have pure cinema perfection, right?Well ...Like the action picture fell at the wayside with some measure of predictability in the late 80's and early 90's, EXPENDABLES 2 suffers from that same mushy story logic and a desire on the part of all involved to have a moment.  Most of the jokes and one-liners work just fine - swimmingly, in fact - but there are a few that could've been easily trimmed.  Unlike the first go-round, this second installment feels a bit bloated, and that's probably because every action star and their kitchen sinks were chucked in here.  As a consequence, some of it ends up being more than a bit schlocky ... and that's never a good thing.For example, Chuck Norris joins the film as Booker, an almost infamous professional of legendary status.  I won't spoil it for viewers, but, suffice it to say, his addition here comes off more cartoonish than it does anything else.  There's nothing wrong with a kind of invulnerability (we expect THAT of our action heroes) ... but an almost magical, mystical ability to appear in the middle of a firefight when no one called?  That's over-the-top ... and, speaking of over-the-top, Stallone made an action / family film called OVER THE TOP, and I'm surprised that didn't serve as a joke here.Some of the material grows tired in this second go-round, but, as I hear a third script is being fleshed out at present, let's hope the movie gods don't make the same errors next time.  It's precisely this kind of thinking that brought the traditional action flicks of the 80's and 90's crashing to a halt at the cineplexes.  Let's keep an eye on our history, Sly, and let's not have that happen again.THE EXPENDABLES 2 is produced by Millennium Films and Nu Images Films.  DVD distribution is being handled through Lionsgate.  As for the technical specs ... you're kidding, right?  This is a Sylvester Stallone picture, and good ol' Sly knows more than a thing or two about high quality technical specs.  It looks and sounds amazing, just as it should.  Likewise, Sly knows what his fans expect, so he chocks the disc full of extras, including an audio commentary with director Simon West, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and some explosive behind-the-scenes shorts focusing in on the stars, their weapons, and even a respectable history looking back at the rise of the action film ... but very little about the fall of it as a genre.  Simply put: there's everything here an action fan could want and more.  Enjoy it while it's hot!RECOMMENDED mostly for fans of action cinema, though some will no doubt be a bit disappointed in this follow-up as I was.  After an exceptional opening action sequence to put the motion picture in high gear, THE EXPENDABLES 2 settles in way too comfortably into much of the same goofy, loopy territory that helped kill the big budget action picture about two decades ago.  It ain't all bad - with the kind of star power behind this there's always a good shot coming - it's just that this one succumbs to predictability much sooner than its predecessor did.  With Norris, Van Damme, Willis, and Schwarzenegger coming aboard with more screen time, I would've hoped for more.  While THE EXPENDABLES was two steps forward, part 2 was two steps back.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Lionsgate provided me with a DVD screener copy of THE EXPENDABLES 2 by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,"2 and  Stars: EXPENDABLES 2 Expands On Franchise, But Not In A Good Way",1354492800,"12 3,

1481868,AX53DA3FTILL0,B005LAII58,Gene Siskel,"[0, 0]","The Good: An amazing opening action sequence instantly ropes you into the movie.  Jean-Claude Van Damme is the best thing about this movie, he's funny and makes an excellent villain (because he also comes across as menacing).  This movie is funnier than the first one, the chemistry has built up more between Stallone and Statham.  Their bickering will have you laughing.  The dialogue is also an improvement from the first one, granted, it's not going to win for best screenplay, but it helps move things along.  Chris Hemsworth provides the best acting in the movie (like Mickey Rourke in the first one).  He almost seems out of place in this movie because his acting is too good.  Seeing all the biggest action stars of the 80's blow apart an airport together (with civilians still in the line of fire) is an action fan's dream.  oh, and Chuck Norris of course.The Bad:  This movie isn't as well-paced as the first one.  There is a gap where the movie sort of stagnates and attempts to develop its characters with mediocre dialogue.  There are some chuckles during this time, but you'd rather just see stuff blow up and everyone yelling like maniacs.  This movie puts its best foot forward with that opening action sequence, the rest of the movie never matches up to those first 10-15 minutes.  I felt they should have given Van-Damme a bit more in the last fight scene with Sly.  The spin kick ruled, but he should have bounced Sly's head off a wall a couple of times to make the fight more even. Arnold Schwarzenegger, I love Arnold, but he sucked in this movie.  'I'm back' 'He'll be back' 'Everyone is back' enough.  Usually, his awful jokes are funny, but here, their just regular awful.The Deal: This movie is exactly what you think it is and Sly knows it.  It's very tongue-in-cheek where these guys can poke fun at themselves.  If you are an action fan you will catch some of the inside stuff going on here (Knock,Knock written on the tank in the beginning, a reference to one of Arnold's lines from Predator).  This movie delivers from an action standpoint, which is the only standpoint it has to deliver.  This is a slightly better movie than the first one in part because there is some semblance of a plot (Van Damme stealing plutonium to sell to a buyer).  Good enough for me.

1481892,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005LAII58,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Yee-hah! The Preparation H will flow tonight, and the Salonpas! THE EXPENDABLES 2, even more than the first one, is a reunion of sorts for them 1980s action film heroes. It's unabashedly cheesy. It's unapologetically nostalgic. It evokes the zeitgeist of an era three decades gone. Don't overthink the movie. Take it for what it is, as a last hurrah for most of the cast.The plot, for what it's worth: Barney Ross (Stallone), chief dog of an elite merc team, owes the CIA officer, Mr. Church (Willis), a favor, and so off goes his team to retrieve a computer containing blue prints that pinpoint the location of nearly five tons of weapons-grade plutonium. Except the team botches the job, one penalty of which is the cost of a team member's life. Now regard Stallone, veins popping, very much vengeance-minded and so cheesed he's now even more at odds with his archnemesis, enunciation. When asked by his first lieutenant, Lee Christmas (Statham), ""What's the plan?"" I think he says ""Track him. Find him. Kill him.""My quick flurries: I guess Jean-Claude Van Damme's career is in the grip of a mini-revival. I really likedJCVD, in which he played a more down-and-out version of himself. Here, he's very effective and menacing as the film's big bad. Of course, we're treated to his signature helicopter kick. But he needed to guard himself against Sly in their climactic showdown, because Sly has a secret weapon. At any given moment those marbles in his mouth could serve as deadly projectiles.This sequel boasts more wrinkles than the set of Golden Girls, more popped-out veins than in a Rolling Stones hotel suite. Willis and Schwarzenegger return with expanded roles, and there's a really awkward, corny moment in which they trade catch phrases. Gratifyingly, Chuck Norris surfaces to save Sly and company's bacons. At his age, Chuck is better off shooting heavy artillery than dropkicking a dude. Never one to miss dropping a reference, Sly greets Chuck's timely entrance with ""You the one people call the Lone Wolf?"" Did you groan, too?Jet Li makes use of the little time he's in this film - he literally drops out early on - by showcasing his wushu skills in one electrifying segment. This is very cool as I was disappointed that, in the first film, he was mostly firing weapons. However, it's Jason Statham who shines brightest in the action sequences. What that man can do with a knife...The acting? It's okay. No one bit their tongue or anything. Liam Hemsworth, as the team's newest and youngest sniper recruit, acquits himself surprisingly well with the dramatics. Sly and Statham again demonstrate their nice buddy chemistry. But let's not kid ourselves. We're here because we're not only action junkies, we've a soft spot for retro action films. The plot is by-the-numbers, but you couldn't tell me that while I was taking in all the explody stuff and these geriatric heroes wallowing in it. This is such a fun and wild ride! This cast reminds me a bit of the Oceans 11 cast in terms of big name pedigree, except, y'know, this bunch is more wrinkly and more in need of a spot in the gym and also more likely to bed Sally Fields or Nichelle Nichols. I think there'll be a third film. My fingers are crossed for trigger-happy spots for Eastwood, Seagal, Chan, and Gibson. And maybe Carl Weathers, wherever he is.The DVD's bodacious bonus stuff:- Audio Commentary with director Simon West- ""Gods of War: Assembling Earth's Mightiest Antiheroes"" - just a lot of marveling at the fact that they were able to get all these big name stars together (00:21:16 minutes)- ""Big Guns, Bigger Heroes: The 1980s and the Rise of the Action Film"" - examining the 1980s action film hero as a mirror of President Reagan and tracking the evolution of the action film from Stallone to Willis (00:24:57)- ""On the Assault: The Real-Life Weaponry of THE EXPENDABLES"" - Randy Couture hosts a tour of the Gun Store in Las Vegas and shoots on the gun range with weapons that were used in the film (the FN Scar L, Sly's M1911 and Colt Single Action, Crew's Benelli M4, Van Damme's Steyr Aug A3, etc) (00:13:34)- ""Guns for hire: The Real Expendables"" - Real-life private security firms like Trojan Securities International and Ronin Worldwide get some pub (00:24:17)- 5 Deleted Scenes, including more of Crews and Couture in action (totaling 00:04:38)- Gag Reel (00:05:08)",4,"""I now pronounce you man and knife.""",1370044800,"06 1, 2013",2013,4356,"['Yee-hah', 'Preparation', 'H', 'will', 'flow', 'tonight', 'Salonpas', 'THE', 'EXPENDABLES', '2', 'even', 'more', 'first', 'one', 'reunion', 'sorts', '1980s', 'action', 'film', 'heroes', 'unabashedly', 'cheesy', 'unapologetically', 'nostalgic', 'zeitgeist', 'era', 'three', 'decades', 'gone', 'Do', ""n't"", 'overthink', 'movie', 'Take', 'what', 'last', 'hurrah', 'most', 'cast.The', 'plot', 'what', 'worth', 'Barney', 'Ross', 'Stallone', 'chief', 'dog', 'elite', 'merc', 'team', 'CIA', 'officer', 'Mr.', 'Church', 'Willis', 'favor', 'so', 'team', 'retrieve', 'computer', 'containing', 'blue', 'prints', 'pinpoint', 'location', 'nearly', 'five', 'tons', 'weapons-grade', 'plutonium', 'team', 'job', 'one', 'penalty', 'cost', 'team', 'member', 'life', 'Now', 'Stallone', 'popping', 'very', 'much', 'vengeance-minded', 'so', 'cheesed', 'now', 'even', 'more', 'odds', 'archnemesis', 'enunciation', 'When', 'asked', 'first', 'lieutenant', 'Lee', 'Christmas', 'Statham', 'What', 'plan', 'think', 'Track', 'Find', 'Kill', 'quick', 'flurries', 'guess', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'career', 'grip', 'mini-revival', 'really', 'likedJCVD', 'played', 'more', 'down-and-out', 'version', 'Here', 'very', 'effective', 'menacing', 'film', 'big', 'bad', 'course', ""'re"", 'treated', 'signature', 'helicopter', 'kick', 'needed', 'guard', 'Sly', 'climactic', 'showdown', 'Sly', 'secret', 'weapon', 'given', 'moment', 'marbles', 'mouth', 'could', 'serve', 'deadly', 'projectiles.This', 'sequel', 'more', 'wrinkles', 'set', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'more', 'popped-out', 'veins', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'hotel', 'suite', 'Willis', 'Schwarzenegger', 'return', 'expanded', 'roles', 'really', 'awkward', 'corny', 'moment', 'trade', 'catch', 'phrases', 'Gratifyingly', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'surfaces', 'save', 'Sly', 'company', 'bacons', 'age', 'Chuck', 'better', 'off', 'shooting', 'heavy', 'artillery', 'dropkicking', 'dude', 'Never', 'one', 'miss', 'dropping', 'reference', 'Sly', 'Chuck', 'timely', 'entrance', 'one', 'people', 'call', 'Lone', 'Wolf', 'Did', 'groan', 'too', 'Jet', 'Li', 'use', 'little', 'time', 'film', 'literally', 'out', 'early', 'showcasing', 'wushu', 'skills', 'one', 'electrifying', 'segment', 'very', 'cool', 'was', 'disappointed', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'mostly', 'firing', 'weapons', 'However', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'who', 'shines', 'brightest', 'action', 'sequences', 'What', 'man', 'can', 'do', 'knife', 'acting', 'okay', 'one', 'bit', 'tongue', 'anything', 'Liam', 'Hemsworth', 'team', 'newest', 'youngest', 'sniper', 'recruit', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'dramatics', 'Sly', 'Statham', 'again', 'demonstrate', 'nice', 'buddy', 'chemistry', 'let', 'not', 'kid', 'ourselves', ""'re"", 'here', ""'re"", 'not', 'only', 'action', 'junkies', ""'ve"", 'soft', 'spot', 'retro', 'action', 'films', 'plot', 'by-the-numbers', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'was', 'taking', 'explody', 'stuff', 'geriatric', 'heroes', 'wallowing', 'such', 'fun', 'wild', 'ride', 'cast', 'bit', 'Oceans', '11', 'cast', 'terms', 'big', 'name', 'pedigree', ""y'know"", 'bunch', 'more', 'wrinkly', 'more', 'need', 'spot', 'gym', 'also', 'more', 'likely', 'bed', 'Sally', 'Fields', 'Nichelle', 'Nichols', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'third', 'film', 'fingers', 'are', 'crossed', 'trigger-happy', 'spots', 'Eastwood', 'Seagal', 'Chan', 'Gibson', 'maybe', 'Carl', 'Weathers', 'wherever', 'DVD', 'bodacious', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'director', 'Simon', 'West-', 'Gods', 'War', 'Assembling', 'Earth', 'Mightiest', 'Antiheroes', 'just', 'lot', 'marveling', 'fact', 'were', 'able', 'get', 'big', 'name', 'together', '00:21:16', 'minutes', 'Big', 'Guns', 'Bigger', 'Heroes', '1980s', 'Rise', 'Action', 'Film', 'examining', '1980s', 'action', 'film', 'hero', 'mirror', 'President', 'Reagan', 'tracking', 'evolution', 'action', 'film', 'Stallone', 'Willis', '00:24:57', 'Assault', 'Real-Life', 'Weaponry', 'THE', 'EXPENDABLES', 'Randy', 'Couture', 'tour', 'Gun', 'Store', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'shoots', 'gun', 'range', 'weapons', 'were', 'used', 'film', 'FN', 'Scar', 'L', 'Sly', 'M1911', 'Colt', 'Single', 'Action', 'Crew', 'Benelli', 'M4', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Steyr', 'Aug', 'A3', 'etc', '00:13:34', 'Guns', 'hire', 'Real', 'Expendables', 'Real-life', 'private', 'security', 'firms', 'Trojan', 'Securities', 'International', 'Ronin', 'Worldwide', 'get', 'pub', '00:24:17', '5', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'including', 'more', 'Crews', 'Couture', 'action', 'totaling', '00:04:38', 'Gag', 'Reel', '00:05:08']",N/A

I very much enjoyed the first Expendables movie, but I would have to say that I enjoyed this one even a little bit better.  I was a bit sad to see Jet Li leave the group, but oh well...it was still an awesome movie!  Haha, and Chuck Norris!  Very cool to see him back in action again!  He even cracks one of his own Chuck Norris jokes in the movie!  LoL!Here's what it boils down to:  If you're seeking a good solid plot in a movie, this movie may not exactly have what you're looking for...much like the first one.  However, if you're looking for a heavy hitting action extravaganza with lots of of shooting and explosions, with a bit of good humor thrown in, then look no further!  These movies are for the die hard action fans, and if you're one of those types, then you'll simply love this movie!In closing, I do have to say that I was not really a big fan of the Asian chick they threw into the movie...I feel the movie would have faired just fine without her.  At the very least, they could have found someone better for the role I think, because I'm sorry to say, the one they added into it just wasn't that great of an actress I felt.  That's just my own personal opinion though.  However, her roles aren't very big in it and it's not enough of a matter to really take away from the enjoyment of this movie for me.

1481927,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B005LAII58,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[68, 80]","When Sylvester Stallone dreamt up the original EXPENDABLES film, it was designed to be a throwback to the cheesy 80's shoot-'em-up spectacles that were low on plot and character and high on action and adrenaline and combine many of cinema's greatest (or at least somewhat famous) action stars in one film, and it succeeded in some ways and failed in others. The biggest problem that I had with the original is that there were too many patented Stallone-As-Screenwriter moments when he tried to make the film more serious than it EVER needed to be. But when the action was on, it was really glorious to watch all of the over-the-top silliness explode like a Wile E. Coyote cartoon on crank. Fortunately we're treated to much more of that silliness and much less of the seriousness in the Simon West (CON AIR, LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER) directed EXPENDABLES 2.As the film opens with a terrific opening set piece of an assault on a fortified bunker, we are reintroduced to our team of Expendables: Barney (Stallone, not losing a step), Lee Christmas (Jason Statham, he of the mighty chin and eternal 5-O'Clock-Shadow), Gunnar (Dolph Lundgren, who's gone from potential villain to one of the good guys again), Yin Yang (Jet Li, still short), Caesar (Terry Crews and his loud auto-shotgun), Toll Road (Randy Couture... who's barely there), and the new kid on the block, Billy (Liam Hemsworth). The whole opening sequence is an orgy of heads and limbs popping off, kung-fu butt-kicking, geysers of digital blood, and big BIG explosions. It also reveals another bit player with a much larger role in this film, and that is the character of Trench, played by none other than the former Governator himself, looking to get back into film in a big (and fun) way. After a brief interlude, Yin Yang departs the film for... really no particular reason, and they're down a man. When they arrive home, Barney in confronted by the mysterious Company man Mr. Church (played with much more relish this time around by Bruce Willis), who orders his merry band to go and intercept a ""package"" that's been lost in a plane crash in a faraway land. Church also insists that one of his people, Maggie (the lovely and lethal Nan Yu, whose only other ""major"" Hollywood role was in SPEED RACER), goes along for the ride in order to secure the package. Before you can say ""Time for the big villain entrance"", it's time for the big villain entrance, and that is in the personage of Vilain (yes, that's his character's name) as portrayed by Jean-Claude Van Damme (clearly having a good time playing the bad guy). Vilain and his crew rather shockingly kill one member of the team, and that leads our Expendables on a path to vengeance. Vilain leads a vicious group of mercenaries and other cut-throat types whose current objective is to steal five tons of old Soviet weapons-grade Plutonium and sell it to the highest bidders. Church, Trench and another player who appears on the board named Booker (Chuck Norris, playing up his ""Lone Wolf"" image... get it? ""Lone Wolf""?) all come together to take down Vilain and his operation and his seeminlgly endless parade of cannon fodder.Basically everything that was good about the first film is better here. West has a much better and more dynamic style than Stallone does when it comes to having some flair about the action sequences. The film also knows when to lay off the more serious moments to create more forward momentum. Some may find this to be a disservice to the character, but believe me, if this film had gotten bogged down in this death and the reflection/meditation on life and death that the first film had, it would have done the film a greater disservice. The whole cast, particularly the old-timers, seem to be having a really good time here, even if some of them have less to do because of the inclusion of Schwarzenegger, Willis and Norris getting in on the action. The second act does plod on a little, but the film, coming in at a brisk 103 minute run-time, doesn't allow the film to plod for very long.The other thing that is much more evident in this film is its self-awareness. This film, unlike the first film, is VERY aware that it takes place in ""Action Movie/Video Game Land"", as opposed to a semi-realistic setting. Just look at the opening sequence; the good guys fire their weapons with unfailing accuracy as they travel at fifty miles per hour while the throngs of bad guys couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. The sea-plane used in the first film has been retrofitted into an airborne tank. In the second act, one man is able to take down a few dozen bad guys AND a tank in a matter of about seven seconds. By the third act, you have our heroes crashing planes into the ground with no real consequences, drilling machines coming out of nowhere, and people RIPPING THE DOORS OFF CARS. This same idea also applies to the character motivations and dialogue: Vilain is evil because he's the villain and he knows it (It's in his name, for God's sakes), and even has the line ""No loose ends"" at one point. The good guys are super-quipping machines. Willis and Schwarzenegger share a scene where they throw each other's movie catch-phrases in their faces. This film has abandoned all pretense of reality and that makes it work SO much better than the first film. It's also a real thrill for those of us action fans who were coming of age in the 80's to see Sly, Bruce, Ahnuld, and Chuck killing dozens of bad guys together. The only notable absence from the first film is that of Mickey Rourke, who, admittedly wasn't much of an action star anyway, unless you want to count HARLEY DAVIDSON AND THE MARLBORO MAN or the Van Damme/Dennis Rodman action film DOUBLE TEAM. I think those films are better off forgotten, though, don't you?The best sequels are the ones that learn from the mistakes of the previous films and improve on what made the original entertaining in the first place, and THE EXPENDABLES 2 absolutely does all of that and ends up being one of the more entertaining, if least substantial, films of the summer.4/5 Stars.",4,"Big, Bloody, Blow-'Em-Up

Instead of mere cameos, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger play have acting roles and of course, none other than CHUCK NORRIS comes in!

Unlike before, Jet Li shows off his hand to hand fighting skills as does Jason Statham, though Jet Li's time on screen is far too limited for my taste. It even leaves room to pass the baton to up and coming action stars (younger Helmsworth and Scott Adkins). There is little adherence to a plot, but that serves this particular movie well.

I hate selling out a movie ... like those trailers that after watching it you feel as if you just watched the entire movie in 5 minutes ... but there are some good surprises in this film. The story line is definitely stronger and more in depth than the first (good improvement) but they also cut the story for the sake of senseless action. Not a bad trade off in my opinion.Of course with an all action star line up you may be wondering about the quality of acting but it's all good, no disappointments at all but then most of my favorite 80s and 90s stars are in there so possible biased and boy do they all look old!So if you don't like movie spoilers, don't read on ...Stallone and Statham have a real good connection and make a good team, though I think there is less emphasis on Statham's character and more on Stallone. Jet Li got more a guest appearance at the start but hopefully he'll be back if there's another installment because he was missed.Finally a real movie that starred Willis, Arnold (don't pretend to spell his surname) and Stallone with a compliment of other good action stars. Yes there are a few tacky statements about each other that could have been left out but there's also some good humor in it. Van Damme played a fantastic bad guy; I mean have you seen his productions in the last 10 years? Less than entertaining but he really did a good job here.

Like the first film, The Expendables 2 pays tribute to action films of the 1980s and early 1990s, but this time it's not directed by Sylvester Stallone, but rather Simon West, and the shaky camera from the first film is gone, which is a plus.The group of elite mercenaries are sent out to retrieve an item from a safe in an airplane that was shot down in Albania. Church (Bruce Willis) has Maggie Chan (Yu Nan) join the mercenaries because she's a technical expert, and is able to crack the safe once the team finds it. The mercenaries get ambushed by an arms dealer, Jean Vilain (Jean-Claude Van Damme), who wants the item the team retrieved from the safe. The team surrenders the item, but Jean Vilain kills one of their teammates. The team must retrieve the item from the safe while avenging their fallen comrade's death.The Expendables 2 has a great cast which includes: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Chuck Norris, Bruce Willis, Randy Couture, Terry Crews, Liam Hemsworth, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Nan Yu. Unlike the first film, I found that the Expendables 2 shared more camera time with the actors, although Jet Li's camera time got cut into half from the first, and Jet Li fans will be highly disappointed.This time around, the jokes don't fall flat, the action scenes are better staged, the script is better written, and the plot is more enjoyable. The Expendables 2 isn't a great movie, but it does a better job at capturing a good 80/90's action flick. The action is plenty, the plot is still thin, but I definitely enjoyed this better than the first movie, as did my wife. Overall, if you like action films, you'll be satisfied. If you want to see the movie because of the actors, you'll be more satisfied this time around.

1481984,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B005LAII58,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[12, 17]","When I first heard of The Expendables film back in 2009 I was excited, and what man who grew up in the 1980's and 1990's. Sylvester Stallone was making a hall of fame and all-star action film that brought together himself along with Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li, Jason Statham, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and Gary Daniels to name a few. You had action stars from the 1980's, 1990's and 2000's all in the same film. It seemed like a good and fun idea and I thought it would be a great action film. I went to see it when it first came out and leaving the theater I was disappointed. It was at best an action film, and it suffered at The Avengers suffered from. It's a great concept to bring together larger than life action or superheroes, but once you get by the excitement of seeing all your favorite action stars or superheroes in the same film you begin to see the flaw that are plainly there to see. The Avengers had them, but nowhere near as bad as The Expendables. For that reason I when I heard that there was going to be a sequel I wasn't excited. I was interested and paid attention to the news about the film, but I wasn't going to pay ten dollars or more for what I thought was going to be an average action film at best, and after seeing The Expendables 2 recently I was right not to waste my money.The Expendables 2 is much worse than the original. In fact after I watched the film and gave it time the worse my opinion of the film grew. The Expendables overall plot is about them trying to stop a cache of plutonium which Jean Claude Van-Damn is after. Yes I'm not even going to use their character names, because they aren't any characters in this film. I mean who cares about this men whether they live or die, or if you can understand them. Take the first opening action scene I couldn't understand a word they anyone was saying except the curse words, and maybe that's all that they were saying which also led to about a fourth of dialogue to be completely unrecognizable. Next they brought characters in and out of the film for real no reason except to show off as many action stars as possible while being detrimental to the film. For example Jet Li is a great action star, but they got rid of him with in the first ten minutes and introduced us Liam Hemsworth who I believe played Billy a sniper. On a side note Liam really needs to ask his brother Chris for some help with roles. I know he'll get more time in the sequel, but he had like two lines in The Hunger Games and he's just a throw away character that Stallone and the director Simon West try to make us care about. I mean they introduce him he shows off his ability as a sniper, talks about leaving to be with his girlfriend even though they don't we have no connection to the character or care what happens to him, and then he's killed off about ten to fifteen minutes after Li disappears from the film. Oh yes I forgot in the beginning of the film Stallone and his team go rescue some billionaire and end rescuing Arnold Schwarzenegger who is there for some convenient reason to say some funny dialogue and then vanishes. I know I know defenders of this film will say the action films are generally ridiculous and over the top, but The Expendables 2 is laughably ridiculous only in bad way. Most and good action films have a coherent plot and the viewer actually comes to care about the main character or character. The Expendables has turned into the action version of the Ocean films which is basically the same premise bringing together great actors, but studios, directors and even the stars need to realize that bringing together these stars may mean big bucks, but it doesn't mean the film will actually be good. This is turning into a long paragraph. I would talk about the acting, but honestly there is no good acting in this film. During the film Chuck Norris miraculously shows up for some convoluted and convenient reason and saves Stallone's team and then gives some reason about being a lone wolf and disappears again. There really isn't any reason to care about the story or the characters. To be honest each of these action stars films are better than The Expendables 2.All right enough about the bad plot, non-existent characters or the ridiculous dialogue, and let's move on to the action, which is supposed to be the bread and butter of this growing franchise. I have seen a lot of good action films recently in Skyfall, El Gringo, Dredd and Looper. I know I know again defenders of this film will say action films are supposed to be over the top. Yes if it makes sense like for example the Die Hard films. Sure there was some unbelievable action scenes, but they weren't outrageously over the top like in The Expendables films. Directors and actors should know sometimes less is better than more over the top action. Having so many action stars in the film makes the scenes unmemorable and unremarkable. Stallone has plane with a cannon in its nose and he crashes it into a mine, so what and who cares. They climax is in an airport with a hundred unknown or indefinable bad guys while the good guys just shoot their guns and spout some ridiculous dialogue. The action and fight scenes have no meaning and aren't entertaining in anyway.On paper the idea of the Ocean and The Expendables films is a good idea, but as it's put together things quickly fall apart with too many characters to care about, an average to bad plot, bad dialogue and average to bad action or drama, and that is what both of these franchised suffered from and to a lesser extend The Avengers. Like I said once you get over the excitement of seeing all these famous actors, action stars or superheroes together you see the flaws in the film. Overall The Expendables 2 is a bad action film which has limited value in seeing all these action stars together and a few funny lines.",2,A laugably bad action film.,1356307200,"12 24,

I feel it's a good sequel I don't know if it's good as 1st movie thought I have seen that movie a few times & I love it. Now I saw the teaser late last year & it didn't interest me the guy they got to direct Simon West hasn't had a good track record the past 10 years. I heard they made it PG 13 from the start. I had my concern's about it. Stallone not directing & such. I saw the newer trailers & it got me excited I was going to see it anyway being a big fan of the 1st. I saw it & I enjoyed it. I do feel Stallone ghost directed it & Simon West did what he was told. All of the characters return Slyvester Stallone as Barney Ross, Jason Statham as Lee Christmas, Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jenson, Terry Crews as Hale Ceaser, Randy Couture as Toll Road, Arnold Schwarzenegger as Trench, Bruce Willis as Mr Chruch, Chuck Norris as Booker, Jean Cluade Van Damme as Jean Villain, Scott Atkins as Hector, Nan Yu as ,Maggie, Liam Hemsworth as as Billy The Kid & Jet Li as Yin Yang, I'm not doing a huge retrospective with the plot I'll do a big in depth review when I get this movie on DVD or Blu Ray. Just a quick run down is Mr Church has Barney Ross & his team go to Albania to retrive a device from a safe from a plane that crashed you're introduced to this girl named Maggie that can crack the code cause the safe changes comnbinations every 127 seconds. Now originally it was suppose to be Mickey Rourke that was killed but he didn't return as Tool Box so if you've seen this movie you know which Merc is killed. The Merc's are confronted by Jean Villain who kills 1 of The Merc's not telling he takes the device they got from the safe that has blue prints to an abandoned mine that has tons of Plutonium from The Cold War. This movie is plentiful in action. I'm glad they didn't go with the shakey cam. There is CGI & if you don't kow I hate CGI & prefer practical effects. I do think they should've went with practical from the start. But as long as I have fun have characters that I like I really don't get on CGI as much. I can tell that they went for an PG 13 from the start & decided to add gore to get a R rating. But I enjoyed myself this past Friday as I said I'll go more in depth when I get it on Blu Ray. I liked the referances to Terminator, Rambo & the tiny little nod to Cobra. There were some really good fights in here with Stallone & Van Damme. Jason Stahman & Scott Atkins. Simon West did a good job listening to Stallone. Slyvester Stallone did a great job again. Jason Statham did fine. Dolph Lundgren did good. Terry Crews was ok. Randy Couture did ok. Scott Atkins I feel was there to get a younger demographic & I could of done without him. Nan Yu was did a very good job. Bruce Willis was good. Arnold Schwarzenegger was very good. Chuck Norris didn't get whole lot of screen time but he did a good job. No pun intended Jet Li had a really small role but he did fine. Jean Claude Van Damme was pretty good he did he wasn't playing it like he was a zombie like he did in Universal Soldier Regeneration or how he will in Day Of Reckoning or how he did in Assassination Games. Scott Atkins was pretty good.

I can see why people like this movie over the 1st Expendables but for whatever reason I like the 1st more. There isn't much wrong in fact this movie is awesome if you told me like 15 or 20 years ago that their would be a movie where Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis & Chuck Norris would star in it I'd think you were lying. When I saw the 1st Expendables you had Arnold Schwarzenegger & Bruce Willis in cameos I hoped that Stallone would give them more to do. While Stallone didn't direct this movie he did write the script & hopefully have some control. I will admit I had my concern's when I heard this movie would bePG 13 cause the 1st Expendables was R also I was concerned how certain guys were going to be used. I had read that this movie was shot PG 13 from the get go I believe that cause it looked like CGI gore was added. But getting to the movie it was made on $100 million & made $312 million directed by Simon West he directed Con Air, The General's Daughter, Tomb Raider & The When A Stranger Call remake which blows. The cast all return except for Mickey Rourke. Sylvester Stallone as Barney Ross, Jason Statham as Lee Christmas, Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jensen, Terry Crews as Hale Caesar, Randy Couture as Toll Road, Arnold Schwarzenegger as Trench Mauser, Bruce Willis as Mr Church & Jet Li as Yin Yang. You have some newer cast members Jean Claude Van Damme as Jean Vilain, Chuck Norris as Booker, Scott Adkins as Hector, Liam Hemsworth as Billy The Kid & Yu Nan as Maggie. The movie starts off in Nepal where The Expendables have to go rescue a hostage who turns out to be Trench Mauser. You open up to a great action scene with the team just mowing down enemy soldiers. There is also this really cool fight scene with Jet Li in The kitchen using kitchen items on these enemy soldiers. When  they find Trench he says that this is embarrassing. Trench asks for a weapon he takes Hale Caesar's AA 12 Shotgun he says that if he doesn't get it back his a  *  * is terminated. Arnold Schwarzenegger responds ""In your dreams."" Your introduced to Billy The Kid who is a Sniper he kills some of the enemy troops when the team is surrounded. Plus you get a really entertaining chase scene in the water where the team is trying to get aboard the plane. You have the team at the bar having a good time Lee is still together with Lacy & it was nice that they followed that up to show that sub plot mattered. You have Billy tell Barney that he is going to finish up at the end of the month so he can be with his Girlfriend. Ross gets work in Albania. Mr Church wants him & his team to go & get these blueprints & important items from a safe in this crashed plane. Then you're introduced to this girl named Maggie cause she can break locks even if they're electronic. So they go off to Albania & I don't think The Billy The Kid character is bad but Liam Hemsworth is not believable in the role like when he tells the story when he was in The Army just isn't believable with him I think I would've bought it more if they had Marc Dacoscus or Michael Biehn. Anyway they go to the plane crash where Ross & Hale Caesar have to hold open a metal door so Maggie can open the safe you have this group lead by Jean Vilain he wants what they found in the safe he's captured Billy he wants what they found or he will kill Billy. He has Ross's knife & uses it to cut a huge gash on Billy's chest. Maggie gives up the device & Lee Christmas tosses at Jean Vilain & group Hector Jean Vilain's right hand man tells Lee to pick it up or he will kill Billy so he hands it to him. Vilain tells the team to get on the ground Vilain hands Hector the knife Vilain asks Billy if he's afraid of him he says no so Vilain roundhouses the knife right into Billy's chest killing him. Ross wants to know why was the device so important that 1 of their teammates was killed over it. Maggie tells them that it has blueprints to some plutonium under a mine. Stallone has a great line when they bury Billy ""Why is it that 1 of us who wants to live the most, who deserves to live the most dies, & the 1 that deserves to die keep on living? What's the message in that?"" Not as great as the line from Mickey Rourke in the 1st movie but it's still well spoken. Then you have this very direct straight forward line that I remember being in the trailer ""Track them, find them kill them!"" Mr Church gets in contact with Ross he is mad that they didn't get the device from the safe. Ross tells him that he always pulls the strings but you always have other people do you dirty work. He also tells him that they're done. They get into this town where Ross & Lee get into a fight in this bar. Maggie takes this manicure kit & uses it to torture these guys to find out some info on Vilain. They find this abandoned town that was used in The Cold War. A scene that was funny when they're talking they would eat for their last meal. Gunner said ""Baby Seal & Whalea  *  * in the summer."" He looks at Maggie who is Chinese & says ""I would really die for some Chinese."" Ross says ""Then you're going to starve to death."" I thought that was 1 of them more funnier lines that Dolph Lundgren had they really made Dolph Lundgren goofy in this movie in the 1st movie Gunner had a drug problem he wasn'tre  t  ar  e  d. I did laugh when the song It's A Beautiful Morning the next morning. Hale Caesar steps outside for a moment where these group of fighters called The Sangs that work for Vilain. Hale Caesar goes back in & yells for everyone to get down. You have them get in a big shootout with The Sangs Ross gets in contact with Lee who is fixing a truck he asks if they can hold them off Ross responds by saying ""Yeah maybe with a tank."" Low & behold a tank is coming after The Expendables. They're low on ammo the tank is blown up with rocket the team wondered who took out the tank & who helped them take out The Sangs. It turns out to be 1 of Barney Ross's old friends Booker where they used The Good The Bad & The Ugly theme to me it didn't fit I think they should've used The Delta Force theme or The Walker Texas Ranger theme. Booker is more of a loner Ross says he had heard a rumor that he had been bitten by a King Cobra. Booker tells him ""Yeah I was but after 5 days agonizing pain, The Cobra died."" The theater I was in there was a lot of laughs with that line. If you're a fan of Chuck Norris you'll get the line. Booker points in the direction of this village where the people hat Vilain cause he takes people from the town they never return cause Vilain works them to death to find The Plutonium. They're going to take a group of children The Expendables help them out you have a scene where The Sangs are in this Chapel & Lee is disguised as a Preacher he tells The Sangs ""I know pronounce you Man & Knife."" He kills this group with some knives. The team kills off The Sangs then you have Ross, Caesar, Gunner, Toll Road & Maggie gun the last man in the group down I mean they fill that guy full of bullet holes. The Slaves found The Plutonium The Expendables found the mine Ross crashes into the mine. Vilain & Hector escape with The Plutonium he blocks the way so they can't follow. You have a scene where Gunner makes an explosive it doesn't go off where they continue to make this character look stupid Maggie says don't cry Gunner. Anyway Trench shows up in some sort of mining vehicle & says ""I'm back!"" Mr Church decides to help The Expendables. Then you go to this awesome finish at an airport. The back & forth between Bruce Willis & Arnold Schwarzenegger is funny cause Arnold Schwarzenegger needs to reload & says ""I'll be back."" Willis says ""You've been back enough!"" Schwarzenegger says ""Yippe ki yay."" You have Mr Church get this compact car & you get that hilarious line that was in the trailer "" My shoes are bigger than this car"" Plus you have Chuck Norris gun this guy while he is going through an airport X Ray Machine. Vilain & Hector try to escape Lee gets in a fight Hector a very good fight resulting in Lee hitting Hector with a pair of brass knucks & his head is chopped up on an airplane propeller. There is this really good fight between Stallone & Van Damme it was originally written Jean Vilain was running away from Barney Ross Van Damme asked for it to be rewritten which I am glad he did cause this was nearly what I would call a great fight. Ross kills Vilain & brings his head out to Mr Church Trench says it's a nice touch. Ross & Maggie say their good byes which was a nice scene. Mr Church got a plane for The Expendables it looks like it's from the 30's or 40's  Ross says ""That thing belongs in a museum."" Trench's response is ""We all do."" As they head off Lee tells Ross that he needs to learn how to fight cause he is bruised & cut up from his fight. Anyway this was a strong sequel it did keep a lot of good stuff from the 1st movie with the action straight forward plot humor that was funny for the most part. I didn't care for how they made The Gunner Character look goofy. The AA 12 Shotgun lost a lot of it's guts I could tell that it was shot for a PG 13  from the start. But this was a strong sequel & has a lot of good things going for than bad things. Simon West did a good job although I am sure that Stallone had a lot of input either way it was directed really good. Sylvester Stallone did a great job. Jason Statham was good. Arnold Schwarzenegger was given a little more time & he did a good job as did Bruce Willis who got more time too. Terry Crews gave a nice normal performance. Dolph Lundgren did a pretty good job despite being written as a goofy character. Liam Hemsworth was ok. Jean Claude Van Damme was good. Scott Adkins did a good job. Yu Nan did a very good job I surprised cause I had never heard of her before. Jet Li did fie although he was only in the movie like 5 minutes or less. Definite recommendation stoong sequel. I know their is an Expendables 3 coming out next summer but I am in no hurry in seeing the cast it's going to filled with UFC guys & girls & Boxers they're great athletes but they don't make good actors most of the time. I am not looking forward to Mel Gibson as the villain cause of how low he has became as human being. I know they got Wesley Snipes & he should be the villain or how about Michael Wincott Sean Bean would make a better villain than Mel Gibson. I would rather have Vincent Klyn. Kelsey Grammer nothing about him says action star. Kellan Lutz from The Twilight movies come on Stallone you couldn't get Jeff Speakman, Thomas Jane, Karl Urban, The Rock, Vin Diesel, Kurt Russell or even Michael Biehn. I know the story why Bruce Willis isn't coming back. I agree with Wesley Snipes & Antonio Banderas that's the only casting I like this movie will suffer the part 3 curse it looks like. So it's going against what The Expendables & even Expendables 2 set out to do going back to the old 80's 90's action movies but update it a little bit. Anyway check out Expendables 1 & 2 if you're a fan of old school action movies.",5,Expendables 2 review & a retrospective 9/10,1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2013,11186,"['Here', 'am', 'review',

He was more interested in character development in this movie than in the first one.  But at the same time, he was trying to spoof all of his fellow action adventure actors -- and there are so many used up lines scattered through the film it's almost torture (see if you can count them all up).  Ironically, what made the first movie so much fun is that it was all done on the fly by Sly -- he literally directed and ran headlong in to walls at the same time.  And it was great just for that reason.  He let all these venerable action adventure actors just do their thing around a loosely structured plot.  Coupled with the edgy motorcycle lifestyle and strange tatoos and jewelry it worked really well.  Micky Rourke's role in the first film -- and not repeated in the second -- was particularly interesting.  I enjoyed the second film, but it's just a bit too polished and too scripted.  Yeah, the group succeeds in blowing !@#$ up pretty much nonstop.  And Jean-Claude Van Damme is particularly strange bad guy.  But the slickness takes something away from the first movies grit.

A reader/reviewer informed me that it was a movie for the below 50+ crowd and I was obviously not part of it. What's ""The Expendables 2"" then? I would expect it was also created for the machismo, teen boy crowd--like, wow, man, shoot that sucka!!! Only this time--and for all movies like this--I'm in! In fact, I'm in big time!But then again, this old broad is the same age as the machismo dudes with the duality of muscles and wrinkled skin wrapped around them! Sylvester Stallone, that heartthrob of the '70's and '80's, is the leader of a band of misfit former soldiers, now a tightly knit band of mercenaries for extracting good guys and executing bad guys.Many scenes are absolutely unbelievable--in fact, so much so, that the viewer just goes along for the ride. The most blatant is the pop-up appearance of Chuck Norris in the the most incredibly isolated area. Yet, there he is eradicating the piled up forces of evil and freeing our dudes.The most fun part of the movie for me is the inclusion of Jason Statham as second man to Stallone. I have never seen Jason play second to anyone, but this was fun to see him in a secondary spot. Gives him new dimension.Someone nearly always dies in a movie like this. I was not happy with the choice, but this man's death moved the action along in a new direction and tidied up disrupted emotional energies.I loved this movie despite its preposterous action scenes. I loved the one-liners and the comraderie.

Lame jokes. Stiff acting. Dumbed-down plots. You say, isn't that what 80's and 90's action movies were known? Well, sure, but they did them in a way that wasn't self-parody. The Expendables IS self-parody and this latest entry was an abomination. Avi Lerner is the King of Low-Budget DTV fare and has brought that over to theatrically released films. This was a perfect action cast thrust into a poorly plotted, truncated time-wise (90 min or so for that many characters?), lop-sided film. The draw was Jean-Claude Van Damme going up agains Sly Stallone. A &#34;love letter to martial arts fans&#34; as Stallone was quoted as saying. Well, a six minute end fight, poorly doubled and choreographed with Van Damme is hardly a &#34;love letter.&#34; The rest of the movie is okay, but the groans really come with the most thrown together, incoherent ending I've seen. All these beloved action heroes quoting each other's famous lines from other movies, many badly timed, and one lame joke after another. Action fans deserved better. Only the insanely large cast gets this 3 stars. As a movie, it probably is 1-2 stars. The blu-ray has minimal extras.

You gotta love the star-studded cast of The Expendables 2, especially if you are an action fan like myself.  There are some great fight scenes and like The Avengers, this film does a good job of balancing screen time so you get to see everyone in action.  The fast pace of the film kept it from being a drag, and it was a very fast watch.  One liners and bad acting also make this film hilarious, and I was bursting out laughing at some of the scenes with poorly written dialogue.  I also liked how this film payed homage to older action films, such as The Terminator and Die Hard, by referencing classic lines from those films.  All these elements together made this a very entertaining action film.  As long as you come into the film expecting to have some fun and not take it seriously, you will have a good time with it.While this was one of the more fun films I've seen this summer, there were a lot of flaws with it.  We didn't get to see a whole lot of Jean-Claude Van Damme, which is disappointing because he could've made a great, rather than good villain.  Stallone overshadowed a lot of the cast.  Also, the acting in this film is pretty bad.  That made it more fun for me, but it might not be as enjoyable for everyone else.  This film was also very cliche, although that was probably intended.  Finally, my biggest complaint is the addition of a female to the Expendables team.  That's all I will say about that.The Expendables 2 is a solid action film with plenty of laughs and fun.  If you can get past the cliched story, bad acting, and overused CGI blood, this is a good action film with good intentions.

Barney Ross, Lee Christmas, Yin Yang, Gunnar Jensen, Toll Road and Hale Caesar -- with newest members Billy the Kid and Maggie aboard -- are reunited when Mr. Church enlists the Expendables to take on a seemingly simple job. The task looks like an easy paycheck for Barney and his band of old-school mercenaries. But when things go wrong and one of their own is viciously killed, the Expendables are compelled to seek revenge in hostile territory where the odds are stacked against them. Hell-bent on payback, the crew cuts a swath of destruction through opposing forces, wreaking havoc and shutting down an unexpected threat in the nick of time -- six pounds of weapons-grade plutonium; enough to change the balance of power in the world. But that's nothing compared to the justice they serve against the villainous adversary who savagely murdered their brother. That is done the Expendables way....The cast led by Sylvester Stallone (who also co-wrote the screenplay) (as Barney Ross), Jason Statham (as Lee Christmas), Jet Li (as Yin Yang), Dolph Lundgren (as Gunner Jensen), Chuck Norris (as Booker), Terry Crews (as Hale Caesar), Randy Couture (as Toll Road), Liam Hemsworth (as Billy the Kid), Jean-Claude Van Damme (as Vilain), Bruce Willis (as Church), Arnold Schwarzenegger (as Trench), Nan Yu (as Maggie) & Scott Adkins (as Hector) is great. The directing by Simon West is great. The story by Ken Kaufman, David Agosto & Richard Wenk & the screenplay by Stallone & Wenk is great.The music by Brian Tyler is great. The cinematography by Shelly Johnson is great. The film editing by Todd E. Miller is great. The casting by Marianne Stanicheva is great. The production design by Paul Cross is great. The art direction by Adam A. Makin, Ivailo Nikolov, Ivan Ranghelov & Sonya Savova is great. The costume design by Lizz Wolf is great. The stunts coordinated by Dian Hristov, Noon Orsatti, Chad Stahelski, Stanimir Stamatov & Teodor Tsolov, fights coordinated by Don Thai Theerathada is great. The set dressings by Jaime Fernandez, assistant set decoration by Nikolai Nikolov & set dressings coordinated by Vasilena Boneva is great. The special effects supervised by Alexander Gunn & Ivo Jivkov is great. The visual effects supervised by Danail Hadzhiyski, Ajoy Mani, Stalin Saravanan & Stefan Tchakarov, coordinated by Kiril Georgiev, Vladimir Nikolov, Milena Peneva, Iavor Radev & Plamen Statev is great.This is a fun and entertaining action film that does keep you entertained and is at times, funny as well. This is also a great sequel that is better than its original. Stallone and his crew is solidly great in this one, with a solid villain in Van Damme's Vilain.

Instead of waiting for others to direct, he goes on and does it all himself and makes a triple comeback with the last and proper ending for Rocky, then Rambo, and then tops it all off with his own creation - The Expendables! Again, co-writing and directing it all himself.So of course Expendables 2 comes out and lets loose the dogs of war - but even bigger and somewhat better.Never a dull moment, Ex 2 starts out with one of the best and most explosive action scenes EVER recorded.

Statham makes tons of the same movie, except most don't use his solid acting skills, but only use his action moves. Always the wooden action dude.But Stallone is much smarter than your typical writer/director. He's been around long enough to know the movie audience needs and wants more.

1482099,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B005LAII58,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","This geriatric genocidal shootout amongst old pals, propelled by a mixture of testosterone, big guns, insider jokes, even bigger guns, martial arts and deliberately silly one-liners, is even better than the first instalment. It was clearly conceived as a pure comedy and no matter how hard you try you will not find even one serious moment in it - and I simply loved every second of this tasty treat! Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS and also, quite appropriately, some passably lame jokes.1. Characters and actorsAlmost all of the old cast is present also in this film and it is a mighty good thing, but two of the Expendables are nevertheless absent or almost absent. To my considerable regret Mickey Rourke dropped off and it is a pity but I can easily imagine his character from the first part, Tool, being deceased and currently residing in Valhalla, where he enjoys the company of stripper Valkyries, an unlimited supply of mead and ale and especially an equally unlimited supply of sparring partners he can repeatedly punch in the face, without gloves - and they are all plastic surgeons, something that real Mickey Rourke would probably appreciate... Yin Yang, played by Jet Li, appears only briefly and vanishes after first 10 minutes, but - SPOILER here - no, he doesn't die and therefore maybe he will be back for a longer appearance in the third part...The rest of the gang is all here: Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Hale Ceasar (Terry Crews), Toll Road (Randy Couture) and my absolute favourite Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), still as insane as he is gigantic. They are joined for this adventure by some fresh meat, Billy the Kid (no, it isn't a joke), a young veteran of Afghanistan war, played by Liam Hensworth. Later on they will be joined by Maggie (Nan Yu), a sexy CIA operative, who will in this film give Barney Ross an opportunity to be protective to a young lady reminding him of a daughter he never had (exactly as in the first film)...As we all remember one of the best gags in the first film was about the various complicated issues all those characters had in their life: age (Ross), cheating girlfriend (Christmas), money (Yang), drugs (Jensen), ear related insecurity bordering on depression (Road) and a... well, kind of problem that men who suffer from it usually solve by carrying enormous firearms (Ceasar). In this one it was decided, I think wisely, mostly to not follow further in this way, with the notable exceptions of Christmas and Ceasar's situations... )))That being said we keep learning stuff about the Expendables and most of it is pretty funny, like the fact that one of them really enjoys cooking and he is DEADLY serious about the correct way of making his rigatoni and also that another one has got a PhD - and no, it is not the kind of PhD you immediately thought about, but a REAL one, obtained at MIT! Oh, and we also learn some surprising things about their ethnic origins...)))2. More of everythingThis was the main line of action retained for this film and the director kept it this way from the beginning to the end. You thought that in the first time Ceasar used big guns? Here they are bigger! You found Gunnar Jensen a real b@dass before? Now he is badder! You considered Ross bold? Well, now he is bolder! You liked Bruce Willis being bald? Well, here he is balder! Etc., etc.This film has more action scenes, more violence and definitely more raw fire power than the first one - in fact at one moment a T-72 tank rolls in, all guns blazing! There is also much more humour with a great deal of both good and bad one liners and some extremely funny dialogs, of which my favourite is the one beginning with Stallone saying: ""We are Americans""...)))But the REALLY good thing about this ""more of everything"" approach"" is that both Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger have more screen time and it is used in the most optimal way!3. ZE BAD GUYAs the villain of the story Jean-Claude Van Damme has finally an occasion to do on the screen something more interesting than his usual stuff - and he gives a great show! His character is so completely over the top that it actually helps a lot to transform this film into pure comedy. Let's just count his evil ways: a tall, muscular guy with a threatening face, dressed elegantly in dark clothes, with a clearly satanic tattoo on the neck, talking with a foreign accent and sometimes going the whole nine yards and simply speaking French. And as if all of that was not enough to show that he is the Big Bad Wolf in this story, oh, let's just name him Jean Vilain...)))4. The delicious trashing of modern metrosexual action heroesThere is one great scene in this film involving the background story of ""Billy the Kid"", the youngest and most recent member of Expendables, in which both the director and the scenarist (actually Stallone himself) without the slightest doubt took a big bad shot at the modern action heroes, who are almost always tormented and scarred by PTSD resulting from all possible kind of traumas. Well, the explanation by Billy why exactly did he leave the US Army and decided to become a mercenary is absolutely hilarious and indeed parodies and ridicules completely most of recent ""action heroes"" and their issues...))) This message mocking mercilessly more modern action films and their heroes is then repeated many, many times, with a very literally use of brass knuckles - ""you simply cannot beat a classic!"" ...)))...)))5. The things learned and questions answeredPossibly the most important thing we learn from this movie is that even if chicks with guns can have some part in action films, into some places it is the male hero that must enter - and he must go there ALONE! And no, I am not talking here about men's toilet...This film answers also many burning questions we always wanted to ask but didn't have the courage to do it. What happens when Dolph Lundgren ALMOST has an idea? You will find the answer here. How many Stallones does it take to put one Schwarzenegger into a Smart car? Aye, we got that covered too. Can Stallone shoot people dead with his finger? Watch the film and you will learn the answer! Can Stallone at his age still lift it up? Yes, he can! OK, but can he lift it up in Nepal mountains? Affirmative! Yes, but can he lift it up in Nepal mountains, on a plane, under heavy mortar fire and with just one hand? Err... not sure here. Watch the film.6. Other treasures and delightsThe appearance of Chuck Norris is of course a splendour - the first time he shows I almost cracked some ribs laughing! You will also certainly appreciate an awkward, quasi intimate face to face moment between Schwarzenegger and Stallone, the new decoration of the plane the Expendables use, Mr Christmas disguised as a priest and many other little delights, which I will not enumerate here, because counting to infinity is a very difficult thing - even Chuck Norris managed to do it only twice...)))WARNING FOR PET OWNERS: my chipmunks watched this film with me (from their cage they can see the TV screen) and ever since then they chase one after other like crazy and I hear them go ""pew, pew, pew"" and ""ka-boom!"" a lot. I am fine with it, but if you have a big dog it can be more problematic - so beware.ALCOHOL INFORMATION: this film encourages somehow the consumption of weakly alcoholised beverages - after the first 5 minutes I simply had to go and get me a bottle of ""Corona"". Then another one. And another. In all I went through eight of them this evening and boy, did I have good time! But of course you do not have to choose ""Corona"" - I reckon you can also as well drink beer...Bottom line, this is an excellent action comedy, without even one serious moment but with megatons of humour - however, it is rather a film for guys, so it may be better to watch it when your better half is busy with the latest ""Twilight"" marathon on TV. I am absolutely keeping my Blu-ray for another re-watch!

1482119,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005LAII58,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","If you saw THE EXPENDABLES then you have a clue as to what to expect from any sequel. Lots of explosions, plenty of gunplay and hand to hand combat from a group of mercenaries who also tend to have a moral backbone. The first film delivered tons of action to the point that I consider it one of the best action films ever made. It was popular enough that a sequel had to follow. So how does THE EXPENDABLES 2 stack up?The opening sequence offers up the action quota quite well and we get to see the team in action. We also meet a new member, a sniper by the name of Bill (Liam Hemsworth). Each member is given enough screen time to earn them their paycheck and before the sequence ends, team member Yin (Jet Li) parachutes out of their plane never to return for the rest of the film.When they return home ready for some R & R, Barney (Sylvester Stallone) is contacted by Church (Bruce Willis). Unhappy with the outcome from the first film, he tells Barney he has another mission for the team, an easy one that will square things away between them. Mission in hand and the addition of a CIA operative Church sends along, the group sets out for a small European country to retrieve some codes locked in a safe.The group retrieves the codes and is ready to head out when they're confronted by a problem they weren't warned about. Vilain (Jean-Claude Van Damme) and his men have the team surrounded and Bill with a gun to his head. The team can do nothing but give in and surrender the codes. Even though they've complied, Vilain kills Bill in front of them before leaving. Of course this sets the revenge ball rolling and Barney will stop at nothing until he gets the codes back and sees Vilain dead.The premise for the film is rather simple but that's never been a problem with either film. It's a core story that surrounds itself with tons of action and special effects. That's what these films are all about. That and half a dozen hand to hand combat sequences that would result in work for half the stunt men in the world. These films are action films made for fans and for fun. And the new one delivers, for the most part.This time around though it feels different. For one the surprise has been taken out of the equation. The first film we all wondered what it would be like to see some of the biggest names in action films from the 80s together on the screen at the same time. We got that and this time around we get it in spades. We have the members of the original cast together again and Willis and Schwarzenegger are even allowed to play with the rest this time around. Not only that, but Van Damme and Chuck Norris are tossed in as well. Norris has an especially funny part in the film. And yet it doesn't feel the same.Perhaps it's seeing all of our heroes from the past aging just a bit before our eyes even though every one of them still seems fit and perhaps more so than when they were the hottest thing in action films. Maybe it's that the quips and witty one liners we've come to associate with them feel rather old hat here. Yes, they are cute but for me they came up too often. I'm not sure what it is but it made me feel that this film wasn't quite as good as the first one.That being said it's still a great action film. And seeing Willis, Schwarzenegger and Stallone shooting their way through an airport, all of them in the same shot, was amazing. This is not an action film where you'll find yourself wondering how plausible the movie is or if the situations seen could really happen. This movie is a roller coaster ride that takes you up and down, tosses you around and then makes you want to go for another ride. It's a popcorn movie, plain and simple, and one to be enjoyed for just that reason.Word is that a third film is in the works. It will be interesting to see what other action stars of the 80s are brought back for this one. Steve Seagal? Mel Gibson? Perhaps they'll choose a different route and bring in action stars of today with the hopes of making this series of films last longer with a new crew taking on bad guys. No one knows except Stallone who's been behind both films. Let's just hope it continues and only gets better with each film.",4,80'S HEROES UNITE!,1354233600,"11 30, 2012",2012,4180,"['saw', 'THE', 'EXPENDABLES', 'then', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'expect', 'sequel', 'Lots', 'explosions', 'plenty', 'gunplay', 'hand', 'hand', 'combat', 'group', 'mercenaries', 'who', 'also', 'tend', 'have', 'moral', 'backbone', 'first', 'film', 'delivered', 'tons', 'action', 'point', 'consider', 'one', 'best', 'action', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'was', 'popular', 'enough', 'sequel', 'had', 'follow', 'So', 'how', 'EXPENDABLES', '2', 'stack', 'up', 'opening', 'sequence', 'up', 'action', 'quota', 'quite', 'well', 'get', 'see', 'team', 'action', 'also', 'meet', 'new', 'member', 'sniper', 'name', 'Bill', 'Liam', 'Hemsworth', 'member', 'given', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'earn', 'paycheck', 'sequence', 'team', 'member', 'Yin', 'Jet', 'Li', 'plane', 'never', 'return', 'rest', 'film.When', 'return', 'home', 'ready', 'R', 'R', 'Barney', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'contacted', 'Church', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Unhappy', 'outcome', 'first', 'film', 'Barney', 'mission', 'team', 'easy', 'one', 'will', 'square', 'things', 'away', 'Mission', 'hand', 'addition', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Church', 'along', 'group', 'out', 'small', 'European', 'country', 'retrieve', 'codes', 'locked', 'safe.The', 'group', 'codes', 'ready', 'head', 'out', 'when', ""'re"", 'confronted', 'problem', 'were', ""n't"", 'warned', 'about', 'Vilain', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'men', 'have', 'team', 'surrounded', 'Bill', 'gun', 'head', 'team', 'can', 'do', 'nothing', 'give', 'surrender', 'codes', 'Even', ""'ve"", 'complied', 'Vilain', 'kills', 'Bill', 'front', 'leaving', 'course', 'revenge', 'ball', 'rolling', 'Barney', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'codes', 'back', 'Vilain', 'dead.The', 'premise', 'film', 'rather', 'simple', 'never', 'been', 'problem', 'film', 'core', 'story', 'tons', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'what', 'films', 'are', 'dozen', 'hand', 'hand', 'combat', 'sequences', 'would', 'result', 'work', 'stunt', 'men', 'world', 'films', 'are', 'action', 'films', 'made', 'fans', 'fun', 'new', 'one', 'delivers', 'most', 'part.This', 'time', 'different', 'one', 'surprise', 'been', 'taken', 'equation', 'first', 'film', 'wondered', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'see', 'biggest', 'names', 'action', 'films', '80s', 'together', 'screen', 'same', 'time', 'got', 'time', 'get', 'spades', 'have', 'members', 'original', 'cast', 'together', 'again', 'Willis', 'Schwarzenegger', 'are', 'even', 'allowed', 'play', 'rest', 'time', 'around', 'Not', 'only', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'are', 'tossed', 'as', 'well', 'Norris', 'especially', 'funny', 'part', 'film', 'yet', ""n't"", 'feel', 'same.Perhaps', 'seeing', 'heroes', 'past', 'aging', 'just', 'bit', 'eyes', 'even', 'one', 'still', 'fit', 'perhaps', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'were', 'hottest', 'thing', 'action', 'films', 'Maybe', 'quips', 'witty', 'one', ""'ve"", 'come', 'associate', 'feel', 'rather', 'old', 'hat', 'here', 'Yes', 'are', 'cute', 'came', 'up', 'too', 'often', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'made', 'feel', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'being', 'said', 'still', 'great', 'action', 'film', 'seeing', 'Willis', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Stallone', 'shooting', 'way', 'airport', 'same', 'shot', 'was', 'amazing', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'where', ""'ll"", 'find', 'wondering', 'how', 'plausible', 'movie', 'situations', 'seen', 'could', 'really', 'happen', 'movie', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'down', 'tosses', 'around', 'then', 'want', 'go', 'ride', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'plain', 'simple', 'one', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'reason.Word', 'third', 'film', 'works', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'other', 'action', 'stars', '80s', 'are', 'brought', 'back', 'one', 'Steve', 'Seagal', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Perhaps', ""'ll"", 'choose', 'different', 'route', 'bring', 'action', 'stars', 'today', 'hopes', 'making', 'series', 'films', 'last', 'longer', 'new', 'crew', 'taking', 'bad', 'guys', 'one', 'Stallone', 'who', 'been', 'films', 'Let', 'just', 'hope', 'only', 'better', 'film']",N/A

Maggie Chan (Yu Nan) is added in as the ""minority to pick on"" who can hold her own amongst all the men.  The only one missing is Mickey Rourke, but he's replaced by sniper Liam Hemsworth as Billy the Kid.  Billy wants to leave this rough-and-tumble life, which we know means he's doomed to serve as a tragic example for the others to kick butt and take names.With that setup in place, said butt-kicking begins in earnest.  Statham and Stallone trade the best lines, and their easy humor (""when I see you I'm going to shoot you in the face!"") anchors the film. That doesn't make up for the fact that someone who has been around as long as Ross will fire a pistol into the air to scatter wolves (thereby alerting the enemies he knows are lurking in the area) or that playing a jukebox in an abandoned building might be a bad idea (thereby alerting the enemies he knows are lurking in the area).  The bad guys, led by Jean Vilain (Jean-Claude Van Damme), all sport a devil insignia in the form of a goat - they even hang the sign outside of the local bar to helpfully guide our heroes as where to go to beat information out of them.Expendables 2 plays a lot like a bad Dungeons & Dragons scenario: go out on an adventure for treasure and glory and then, when things get rough and our heroes blunder stupidly into a situation, the Dungeon master throws in Chuck Norris.  No joke.  Chuck-mother-effing-Norris shows up as Booker in a hilarious cameo to save the day not once, but twice.It all culminates in an orgy of violence featuring Van Damme, Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Willis, and Norris, which is as close to action film nirvana as you're ever going to get.  By the time Schwarzenegger spouts ""I'll be back"" and Willis rolls his eyes, we're transported back to roles that made them all famous.  When Schwarzenegger tears the door of a mini-electric car, we're reminded that they don't make cars - or action heroes - like they used to.This is a gleefully dumb movie.  But I don't care.

Sure, it had more &#34;stars&#34; (Arnold, Willis, CHUCK), but it didn't have as much energy.  There wasn't as much interaction between the characters, which really had a rapport going in the first one.  There was substantially less dialogue.  The bad guy just wasn't as interesting.

being shot & living, was just unnecessary & slowed the pacing down in the first film, although Eric Roberts & ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin were effective villians, they were a bit underused in the first film, but with this second film, we get a better pace & everyone this time around get equal screen time it seems, plus we get more Arnold & Bruce here, like many people in my age group I grew up watching Arnold, Stallone, Bruce Willis, Chuck Norris, & Jean Claude Van Damme, to have them all in the same movie is somthing I never thought I would see & I have to say this made the film for me,

1482156,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B005LAII58,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[16, 23]","A selling point of the originalThe Expendableswas that such a movie would surely never be seen again: supposedly, it would be impossible for such a collection of career-minded egos to come together for a second time, and thus we should enjoy it while we could. I never doubted that there'd be a sequel, but if you want to think of this as an example of lightning striking twice, it can only serve to make the movie more noteworthy. I liked the first film enough to give it four stars and thus went into this one with reasonably high expectations - expectations which almost ended up being too high. The novelty of seeing a big collection of action heroes has been slightly reduced - partially by the film's delivery, partially by a bunch of other movies having copied the theme in recent years - and a few of the unfulfilled rumors regarding the cast list were particularly disappointing, but in the end, it ended up being a very well-rounded big-budget action flick that - however imperfectly - mixes deconstructive comedy with a varied collection of fulfilling adrenaline scenes.The story: when the newest Expendable (Liam Hemsworth,The Hunger Games) is killed during a mission by an evil mastermind looking to harvest a forgotten cache of plutonium (Jean-Claude Van Damme), the old team - featuring Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, and Terry Crews - goes on a mission of vengeance to take down the villain and his forces.I think most fans who followed the development of the movie had their own hopes for potential new additions to the cast. Stallone himself mentioned Lorenzo Lamas, Jeff Speakman, and Olivier Gruner by name. The fact that none of these guys made it into the movie is disappointing, and it'll disappoint even more people that Jet Li disappears from the feature within the first twenty minutes. Additionally, Randy Couture's role has been reduced to the point that he's almost facetious to the picture, so his fans will probably be disappointed as well. I was personally appalled that a prettyboy with only three movies under his belt (at the time) was given access to such an elite ensemble, but luckily for me, his demise coincides with the arrival of Van Damme's return to the big screen, as well as that of number one henchman Scott Adkins (last seen in theaters forX-Men Origins: Wolverine). Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger were in the last flick, albeit as cameos to help sell the movie poster, but their vastly increased characterization and action participation almost makes them feel like brand new characters, particularly in Schwarzenegger's case. Chinese actress Yu Nan (who had played alongside Dolph Lundgren before inDiamond Dogs) fulfills the ""female Expendable"" role fans had been clamoring for, and while I would have vastly preferred seeing a more accredited face like Cynthia Rothrock or Michelle Yeoh in the part, Yu is both a good actress and a physically capable one. Rounding off the credited cast is Chuck Norris, who disappointingly isn't very physical: though he has the best entrance I've seen in a while, he only gets to shoot a bit and utter the expected Chuck Norris Fact during his approximate ten minutes of screentime.Oh yeah, Mickey Rourke's gone MIA, too.Where the action is concerned, I can only complain about its distribution: too much time elapses in the middle of the picture without any fighting or shooting going on. When either does happen, though, it tends to be good - sometimes very good. I recount at least three or four lengthy guns & effects battles, mixed with some nice vehicle-related sequences (at least half of these are CG-rendered, though, so I can't be as impressed by them as I'd otherwise be). I was very pleased that there's a scene near the end of the picture where almost all of the stars still alive at the time were caught up in an extensive gunfight. Of course, anyone who knows me will know that I was much more eager for the hand-to-hand fights, and I ended up satisfied. In pre-production, Stallone referred to this sequel as a ""love letter to the martial arts,"" and while I'm not sure this is exactly what it is, the fistfights we see are roundly good. Though the match-ups in the original film enticed me more (i.e. Lundgren vs. Li, Gary Daniels vs. Li & Statham), these here are categorically filmed better, having all but completely done away with the questionable camera angles and disappointing cutting of the originals. Disappointingly, neither Lundgren nor Couture nor the aforementioned Norris are given a clear spotlight to display their martial skills, but the battles which are highlighted - Jet battling a bunch of guys in a kitchen, Statham taking on a bunch of guys in a church, Statham fighting Adkins, and the finale between Stallone and Van Damme - are much better than I expected and definitely above the Hollywood standard. It's all pretty grounded stuff and satisfyingly violent with lots of improvised weapon usage. Though none of the brawls will win a nomination for ""fight of the year"" in my book, I'd go as far to say that the inevitable second sequel has a good amount of living up to do.Dramatically, the movie isn't impressive but still fun. I appreciate the comedy Dolph Lundgren is allowed and I like that Terry Crews' character is given a few more character scenes, since he was basically a stock figure in the original. Jean-Claude Van Damme, on a roll ever sinceJCVD, doesn't really get a chance to deliver the dark energy he's been perfecting but still manages to have fun with his character, exaggerating his accent and doing what he can with his limited action until the finale. With her mastery of the English language and smooth delivery, I can easily see Yu Nan growing into a performer along the lines of Maggie Q or Kelly Hu. Guys like Schwarzenegger and Willis are entertaining without even trying. The one thing that really got on my nerves about the characters was the nonstop banter between Stallone and Statham: yes, they've got good chemistry, but if I had to hear them glad-hand eachother one more time, I might've put popcorn in my ears for the remainder of their scenes.Story-wise, I prefer the first film, but the sequel definitely has its predecessor's number when it comes to action scenes. Chances are that fans of the original will receive ""The Expendables 2"" warmly, but even the hardcore action devotees who turned their backs on the original might find this one different enough to consider a different opinion. Myself, I'm already waiting for number three to come out - maybe then we'll finally see Kurt Russell and Steven Seagal added to the cast.",4,"""I now pronounce you man and knife""",1346198400,"08 29,

The leader of the pack is Sylvester Stallone as Barney.  His ""Robin"" is the not so old, Jason Statham as Lee Christmas.  That last name will naturally be worth a few jokes along the way.The film opens with Barney, his crew and his aging airplane (symmetry there) are sent to rescue a Chinese (I think) scientist who has knowledge of blueprints of hidden uranium somewhere in a Russian mine.  Barney is a free agent working for the CIA headed by Mr. Church (Bruce Willis).  Church sends Maggie (Nan Yu) with the guys as she has knowledge of safe cracking needed to retrieve the blueprints.An opposing cadre of really bad guys lead by Jean Vilain (Jean-Claude Van Damme) also want the information so they can sell it to more really really bad guys who want to make some bombs.  The movie directed by Simon West and written by Stallone never takes itself too seriously.  There are plenty of inside jokes that those of us familiar with the actors and their movies will all easily get.  Included in the action are Chuck Norris, a ""lone wolf,"" Jet Li, Randy Couture, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews and Liam Hemsworth (someone the younger generation will recognize).As I was watching the opening sequence of the boys attacking the compound to rescue the scientist, I kept thinking of last year's ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and how that mission was quiet, well planned and stealthily executed.

The first Expendables was a classic in it's own right of paring the big action stars of the 1980s and 1990s together. Stallone did a good job with trying to direct and star for that movie. As he has done with other films in his long career as a star/director. This time around Simon West give us a sequel that lives up will with the first one and at times is more fun than the original. But overall both these film are about equal to each other. I was a big fan of most of these stars in the prime of there careers and it's good to see them all in one film together.For the sequel Jean-Claude Van Damme is the main bad guy and Chuck Norris joins the cast in a cameo. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Dolph Lundgren get more screen time than they did in the first. And Jet Li's part is pretty much reduced down to a cameo appearance.(I guess Li didn't want a big part in this one. But it's still good to see him in the film.) Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham are the central characters, just like in the first. With Terry Crews, Randy Couture,and Dolph Lundgren along for the ride. I'm glad to see Lundgren get a bigger part this time around. In the first, his character was kicked out of the group for substance problems and reckless behavior. Then he turns against the group for revenge and gets defeated (I'm not going to say how. For the ones that haven't seen the first one.). And ends up missing the action packed fight at the end. In this one Lundgren has recovered from his problems and is a team player. His character also at times is the comic relief. The man has had some good movies in the past. He has had some decent ones that went straight to video that went unnoticed. To bad bigger studios didn't give him more of a chance.All in all, The Expendables 2 is a great movie. it's good to see all the big action stars of yesterday in a movie together.

It's all your favourite action stars from the last 3 decades (with a preference for the 80's), including a few more than were in the last Expendables movie.. Chuck Norris and Jean Claude van Damme join the melee this time round.  It's a mindless plot revolving around mindless violence, with van Damme in particular clearly enjoying himself as the (thoroughly) bad guy, whose henchmen have as inexplicably poor aim with their assault weapons as Stallones team have perfect aim every time with their pistols / machine guns / knives / knuckle dusters.  Stallone has passed the directing reigns to Simon West (Con Air) which is an improvement pace-wise on the first, but although the ludicrous action with all those familiar faces is a blast (`scuse the pun) for those who grew up on 80's movies, the movie suffers more than a little from having just too many characters to deal with.  This means Chuck Norris appears as a passing self deprecating type joke rather than a character, and it's odd having Jet Li above the titles when in fact he is in a blink and you'll miss him role.  On the plus side - more Willis and Schwarzenegger is entertaining , even if the wisecracks are somewhat overegged, and the Stallone - Statham duo at the heart of it all still works well, as well as the newcomer Nan Yu and also Liam Hemsworth (The Hunger Games) in an important role.  Scores if not hundreds of bad guys are killed in outrageously bloody and noisy scenes, and it's all done tongue in cheek.Do I seem half hearted about it - well, there's this nagging feeling that with a decent script and maybe half the cast there could have been a really much leaner more entertaining movie here.  People often say that movies aren't as good as they used to be - but when you see a movie knowingly riffing on 80's movies, you can't help thinking that movies ARE in fact better than they used to be.

1482209,A16C1J5AW2CDRE,B005LAII58,O Shepard,"[3, 6]","The first 'Expendables' was a guilty pleasure. Not quite up to the standards of the best of the A-list action pictures such as 'The Dirty Dozen', 'Rambo', 'The Seven Samurai' , and 'Commando', 'The Expendables' was still a fun B-list action film that depended on expertly staged stunt work and an adequate budget to support it. No CGI here.The story line of 'The Expendables' was believable and internally consistent with the script.  'The Expendables 2' will have you shaking your head when you notice scripting inconsistencies.The action sequences in the first film were realistically depicted. No superhero stuff here. The second film will have you wondering how much more incompetent the bad guy minions could possibly get. Can't they hit anyone?The characters in the first film were portraying as a group of aging mercenaries. Although each character was played by a well known action film actor, the characters they played were consistent with the plot. Our action heroes of the second film do not play the aging mercenaries of the first film but play the movie roles of their younger actor selves; action movie stars 'playing' at being mercenaries complete with script references to older roles that they played in previous movies.CGI is extensively used in 'The Expendables 2'. Fake is fake and it is all too obvious. The stunt work is minimal and most of the action sequences look like it was staged for a video game and not a movie set.The insertion of actors into cameos in 'The Expendables 2' seem forced and obvious.  Jet Li makes a brief appearance, does his thing, and then says goodbye and disappears from the film.  Schwarzenegger's, Willis' and Norris' insertion into the film are the same.  And the insertion of Liam Hemsworth as Billy (a last minute change when Mickey Rourke bowed out of the film) will have you crying at the waste of such an interesting new character.The sequel 'The Expendables 2' falls off of a very big cliff and is a big disappointment.  The action sequences are poorly edited. The sequences look more like a cartoon and the characters bear minimal resemblance to the portrayal of these same characters in the first film.It seems to me that van Damme is the only one to get it right. Unfortunately there is not enough of him. His performance in the film seems to have been intentionally staged as a parody of a psychotic killer. His portrayal is the only interesting role in the entire film and the reason I hesitate to award the film only 1 star. He finishes the film with a hilarious over-the-top performance when he meets Barney Frank (Stallone)  in a  man-to-man testosterone induced fight that decides who is the baddest of them all. Yes, the film ends with the cliche ridden good guy fights bad guy fight scene.And last of all, let us not forget the DVD extras. Two particular extras stand out. The first claims to be a history of the evolution of the action movie star of movies of the 1970's and 1980's. Unfortunately, it plays more like a political ad in its admiration of President's Ronald Reagan and George Bush. The second is an explanation of the various weapons used in the film which couldn't help but insert the statements that Nevada is a great state because you can buy any kind of weapon you want, semi-auto and automatic weapons with extended ammo clips banned in other states.I am sure to get criticized for pointing THAT out.",1,Delusional Sly thinks that this Film is Good,1355875200,"12 19, 2012",2012,3391,"['first', ""'Expendables"", 'was', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'Not', 'quite', 'standards', 'best', 'A-list', 'action', 'pictures', 'such', ""'The"", 'Dirty', 'Dozen', ""'Rambo"", 'Seven', 'Samurai', ""'Commando"", 'Expendables', 'was', 'still', 'fun', 'B-list', 'action', 'film', 'depended', 'expertly', 'staged', 'stunt', 'work', 'adequate', 'budget', 'support', 'CGI', 'here.The', 'story', 'line', ""'The"", 'Expendables', 'was', 'believable', 'internally', 'consistent', 'script', 'Expendables', '2', 'will', 'have', 'shaking', 'head', 'when', 'notice', 'scripting', 'inconsistencies.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'first', 'film', 'were', 'realistically', 'depicted', 'superhero', 'stuff', 'here', 'second', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'wondering', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'incompetent', 'bad', 'guy', 'minions', 'could', 'possibly', 'get', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'hit', 'anyone', 'characters', 'first', 'film', 'were', 'portraying', 'group', 'aging', 'mercenaries', 'character', 'was', 'played', 'well', 'known', 'action', 'film', 'actor', 'characters', 'played', 'were', 'consistent', 'plot', 'action', 'heroes', 'second', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'play', 'aging', 'mercenaries', 'first', 'film', 'play', 'movie', 'roles', 'younger', 'actor', 'selves', 'action', 'movie', ""'playing"", 'being', 'mercenaries', 'complete', 'script', 'references', 'older', 'roles', 'played', 'previous', 'movies.CGI', 'extensively', 'used', ""'The"", 'Expendables', '2', 'Fake', 'fake', 'too', 'obvious', 'stunt', 'work', 'minimal', 'most', 'action', 'look', 'was', 'staged', 'video', 'game', 'not', 'movie', 'set.The', 'insertion', 'actors', 'cameos', ""'The"", 'Expendables', '2', 'seem', 'forced', 'obvious', 'Jet', 'Li', 'brief', 'appearance', 'thing', 'then', 'goodbye', 'disappears', 'film', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Willis', 'Norris', 'insertion', 'film', 'are', 'same', 'insertion', 'Liam', 'Hemsworth', 'Billy', 'last', 'minute', 'change', 'when', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'bowed', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'crying', 'waste', 'such', 'interesting', 'new', 'character.The', 'sequel', 'Expendables', '2', 'falls', 'very', 'big', 'cliff', 'big', 'disappointment', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'poorly', 'edited', 'sequences', 'look', 'more', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'bear', 'minimal', 'resemblance', 'portrayal', 'same', 'characters', 'first', 'film.It', 'van', 'Damme', 'only', 'one', 'get', 'right', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'enough', 'performance', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'intentionally', 'staged', 'parody', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'portrayal', 'only', 'interesting', 'role', 'entire', 'film', 'reason', 'hesitate', 'award', 'film', 'only', '1', 'star', 'film', 'hilarious', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'when', 'Barney', 'Frank', 'Stallone', 'man-to-man', 'testosterone', 'induced', 'fight', 'who', 'baddest', 'Yes', 'film', 'cliche', 'ridden', 'good', 'guy', 'fights', 'bad', 'guy', 'fight', 'scene.And', 'last', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'DVD', 'extras', 'Two', 'particular', 'extras', 'stand', 'out', 'first', 'claims', 'be', 'history', 'evolution', 'action', 'movie', 'star', 'movies', '1970', '1980', 'Unfortunately', 'more', 'political', 'ad', 'admiration', 'President', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'George', 'Bush', 'second', 'explanation', 'various', 'weapons', 'used', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'insert', 'statements', 'Nevada', 'great', 'state', 'can', 'buy', 'kind', 'weapon', 'want', 'semi-auto', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'extended', 'ammo', 'clips', 'banned', 'other', 'states.I', 'am', 'sure', 'get', 'criticized', 'pointing', 'out']",N/A

The first film is not without its flaws, but it was fun and bad a** and a really entertaining movie.  (I especially liked the director's cut with the addition of the Shinedown song playing over all the carnage at the end.  For me, his movie's biggest problem is that it's all over the place.  Characters drop in without much reason, deliver some over used catch phrases and drop out just as suddenly and some of the top billed additions to the movie are barely in it (I'm looking at you Chuck Norris)  Plus, you can absolutely see most of the plot coming from a mile away.  **spoiler alert*  I knew Billy the Kid's days were numbered about two minutes into the movie.  It just seemed like the creators of the film, Stallone included didn't have their hearts in it this time.  For me the only stand outs in the entire movie were Liam Hemsworth as Billy the Kid and Jean Claude Van Damme as the new villain ""Vilain"" (Get it?).  Everyone else just seemed to phone it in.  It was nice though to see up and coming Scott Adkins play the Villain's side kick.

Most of the classic 80's heroes are here in top form despite their age, and this movie is a celebration of action movies in general.Great pacing as there is an action scene waiting around the next corner, with Stallone offering a brutal, gory tone no doubt inspired by his latest RAMBO film. Expendables 2 has plenty of light hearted moments with a comical tone despite the vicious action of bullets and martial arts.For great, fun and no holds barred action, buy Expendables 2 to add to your action collection.ACTION: 9/10 Top notch and plenty of it.STORY: 8/10 For an action movie, it's easy to follow and fun.ACTING: 8/10 Exactly what you would hope for. Classic heroes are back.SPECIAL FX: 9/10. Great explosions, bullets and gory action fx.SOUND: 9/10. Doesn't get much better.------------Suggestions for Expendables 3 cast are debatable, but I wouldn't mind seeing Wesley Snipes (pending release) Jackie Chan, Hulk Hogan, The Rock, but also quite a few other overlooked heroes of the past make at the very least, a cameo action scene as they did with Chuck Norris in part 2.Some might even suggest for some female heroes, Milla Jovovich, Sigourney Weaver or Kate Beckinsale, but that's probably pushing it for the future films if the series goes past 3.",4,Expendables 2: Pure Brutal Action with Big Action Heroes,1348531200,"09 25, 2012",2012,1833,"['critics', 'might', 'call', 'classic', 'action', 'heroes', 'dumb', 'characters', 'based', 'past', 'performances', 'brains', 'little', 'brawn', ""'ve"", 'already', 'missed', 'point', 'what', 'heroes', 'Stallone', 'Rocky', 'Rambo', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'van', 'Damme', 'Hard', 'Target', 'Blood', 'Sport', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Conan', 'Terminator', 'are', 'Kicking', '@', 'ss.And', 'start', 'finish', 'what', '2', 'blasting', 'off', 'intro', 'action', 'scene', 'usually', 'reserved', 'ENDING', 'most', 'action', 'movies', 'just', 'put', 'things', 'perspective', 'what', 'store', 'Most', 'classic', '80', 'heroes', 'are', 'here', 'top', 'form', 'age', 'movie', 'celebration', 'action', 'movies', 'general.Great', 'pacing', 'action', 'scene', 'waiting', 'next', 'corner', 'Stallone', 'offering', 'brutal', 'gory', 'tone', 'doubt', 'inspired', 'latest', 'RAMBO', 'film', 'Expendables', '2', 'plenty', 'light', 'hearted', 'moments', 'comical', 'tone', 'vicious', 'action', 'bullets', 'martial', 'arts.For', 'great', 'fun', 'barred', 'action', 'buy', 'Expendables', '2', 'add', 'action', 'collection.ACTION', '9/10', 'Top', 'notch', 'plenty', 'it.STORY', '8/10', 'action', 'movie', 'easy', 'follow', 'fun.ACTING', '8/10', 'Exactly', 'what', 'would', 'hope', 'Classic', 'heroes', 'are', 'back.SPECIAL', 'FX', '9/10', 'Great', 'explosions', 'bullets', 'gory', 'action', 'fx.SOUND', '9/10', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better.', 'Suggestions', 'Expendables', '3', 'cast', 'are', 'debatable', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'pending', 'release', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'Rock', 'also', 'quite', 'few', 'other', 'overlooked', 'heroes', 'past', 'make', 'very', 'least', 'cameo', 'action', 'scene', 'did', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'part', '2.Some', 'might', 'even', 'suggest', 'female', 'heroes', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'probably', 'pushing', 'future', 'films', 'series', '3']",N/A

1482308,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B005LAII58,RMurray847,"[0, 0]","THE EXPENDABLES 2 is a monument to gleeful movie violence.  To a time when movie violence mostly consisted of fist-fights and gun-fights.  When bad guys couldn&#8217;t shoot straight, and good guys never missed, even when firing behind their backs while running, bleeding and jumping.  A time when no one fretted over the body count, except to complain it was too small.Star / co-writer Sylvester Stallone has done something rather remarkable with this series (I know some have said this sequel is better than the first&#8230;to me, they are nearly interchangeable).  He&#8217;s taken a bunch of OLD action stars (I mean both chronologically AND old as in &#8220;past their prime&#8221;)&#8230;himself, Dolph Lundgren, Jean-Claude VanDamm, Schwarzenegger and others and found a way to play off their &#8220;old-schoolness&#8221; to make them kinda cool again.  And he&#8217;s done it with some of the worst dialogue you could possibly imagine.  Scarcely a single line of dialogue sounds original.  It&#8217;s stuff that was clich&eacute;d 20 years ago.  And the cheese factor is upped considerably when someone says to Schwarzenegger, &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna terminate you.&#8221;  Or when Arnold himself says to Bruce Willis (who is the only one who actually looks embarrassed to be in the film), &#8220;Yippee-Ki-Yay.&#8221;And the action sequences are loud and feature lots of the above-mentioned &#8220;bad guys who can&#8217;t shoot straight.&#8221;  And Stallone, Randy Coture, Chuck Norris (looking frightening in a cameo appearance) and Terry Crews mostly just shoot big guns and never miss.  These sequences SHOULD fail, but Stallone has also wisely cast folks like Jet Li and Jason Statham in his film.  These guys are not great actors, but they are great at kicking butt.  Each gets an extended scene or two of hand-to-hand fighting, and these guys are still in good enough shape to actually do a lot of the work themselves, and their convincingness spills into the rest of the sequences&#8230;making them just a tiny bit less ridiculous.The plot of EXPENDABLES 2 has something to with&#8230;oh, who cares?  It&#8217;s completely meaningless.  You either want to see alternating scenes of this large cast killing people and then sharing clich&eacute;d camaraderie or you don&#8217;t.  If you don&#8217;t&#8230;then you won&#8217;t like the film.  If you do&#8230;then you will like it to some point.  I was lukewarm at best.  Yes, these guys can be charming and some of the action is good.  But the dialogue is dreadful and in particular, the scenes where Stallone and Statham (who are supposed to be best buddies) interact are truly painful.  I do admit that I made the mistake of seeing this at home (and by myself!), rather than in a large theater.  I think the film probably demanded to be seen with a large group.I&#8217;m sure there will be another, because Stallone has crafted a successful formula and the duct tape continues to hold him together.  I admire his work (I just try not to look at his complexion&#8230;not sure what&#8217;s going on there).  Through force of will, he revived his own career, and frankly, the careers (or at least paychecks) of a lot of other affable guys.  I do wish he&#8217;d find someone else to write this stuff, though.  I don&#8217;t need Shakespeare&#8230;but it would sure help the enjoyment factor if once in a while, someone said stuff that wasn&#8217;t rehashed from earlier, equally awful scripts.",3,"Some amusing action, but some really BAD dialogue.

Lots of gun play with hits that are more realistic than I have seen before. When a human body gets hit with a .50 round, he doesn't just slump over like in the 1960's TV shows (Combat or Rat Patrol). Here we see massive gore, body parts and parts of body parts flying away. The stunt folks take the hits accurately too, none of that ""slumping over into an eternal snooze"" --these folks look like they were hit with a high-powered round.Excellent job in the hand-to-hand department, although for my money there could have been a lot more of that and a few less one liners. But I confess, some of the one liners were LOL funny! I won't spoil it here, because I detest movie spoiling. Suffice to say I am not given to laugh out loud, especially when I am alone. Some of the humor bits really were perfect!  The exchange between Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger during the big battle scene was HILARIOUS! I am shocked that Van Damme agreed to play the bad guy. He should have because in my book he is the least likeable. Just to have a movie with this kind of a cast is the very definition of EPIC. In that respect it was like The Dirty Dozen, my favorite old school war movie.This is one of those movies that make you saw to yourself, ""I never thought I'd see all these great action actors together in the same movie, I am so glad this happened in my life time!""

1482311,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B005LAII58,Robert Badgley,"[1, 1]","The Expendables 2(released Aug/12)stars Sylvester Stallone as Barney Ross,Jason Statham as Lee Christmas,Jet Li as Yin Yang,Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jensen,Chuck Norris as Booker,Jean-Claude Van Damme as Jean Vilain,Bruce Willis as Mr. Church,Arnold Schwarzenegger as Trench,Terry Crews as Hale Caesar,Randy Couture as Toll Road,Liam Hemsworth as Billy the Kid,Scott Adkins as Hector,Yu Nan as Maggie Chan...phew!....along with a good supporting cast.This film starts in high gear baby;an adrenaline pumping,shoot 'em up,blow 'em up,kill 'em all extravaganza.I do not think I have ever seen a movie that starts off with this much energy to it.You talk about your ""wow""factor,this film has it in spades!Unlike the first in this series,Mr.Stallone has gotten this one right.The film is straight forward.It does not stop to dwell on any one person or back story too long,and when it slows it only does so to allow us to catch our breath for a short and well timed moment,and then the gates open up again and we're off and running.Mr.Stallone has gotten legends Chuck Norris and Jean Claude van Damme on board for this one,and they are a sight for sore eyes.The in-jokes again abound in E-2,even though they're usually groaners of the highest degree.But considering their sources and who happens to be uttering them at any particular moment,they're a hoot and we forgive them,if they do sometimes come close to being silly.As I said in my review for E-1,Mr.Stallone is no dummy,as he is not only bringing all his own fans on board but those of every one of his costars also.A movie like this is a win-win situation for everyone involved.The story starts out on a rescue mission in Nepal.The team is flying high with every gun spewing death at the push of a trigger.They furiously enter an overly guarded compound to rescue....Schwarzenegger!??? Yes,Ah-nold has gotten himself captured trying to rescue a Chinese millionaire;the same guy the team was after.Well,the guys got in but now they have to fight their way out as they repel down tower wires and into a forest.From there some take to the water,while others hop aboard their plane.The plane protects those in the water while also concentrating on taking out forces perched on a bridge.When all are on board they're finding their weight a bit too much to make it over an upcoming dam.Their sea-doos are ditched and after a few very tense moments,they just barely make it over.On board this mission is a new guy called Billy.He was an ex-US forces soldier who served in Afghanistan,and after losing six squad members in a unnecessary shoot out with the Taliban,and his platoon dog mascot,he decided,when his hitch was up,to quit and join Stallone and company.However he confides in Sylvester that he has a girl waiting for him and wants out in a months time,which Stallone has no problem with.Willis shows up with another job for Stallone and the gang.It seems a plane has gone down in Albania carrying the location of a Russian mine in which five tons of weapons grade plutonium was stored.Off the group fly and they arrive and successfully get their item.However just as they're about to leave,Billy,who has been their point/sniper/look out man,has been captured by bad guy Van Damme and his cadre of no good-nicks.They're forced to hand over the map,and just before Van Damme leaves he high kicks Stallones own knife into Billy's chest,killing him.From here on out it is revenge for the Expendables.They follow Van Damme,which leads them to a town in Bulgaria.They are attacked bu his forces the next morning and the fight isn't going so well,as the opposition has brought in a tank.Just when things look their bleakest,the tank and the rest of the enemy are mysteriously taken out.Suddenly Norris shows up out of nowhere and starts a rather nonchalant convo with the guys.And just as soon as he arrives,he is gone.The Expendables carry on and upon learning the exact location of the mine they fly their plane right into it.Van Damme flees just before this and triggers the mine to collapse,which traps the guys in the mine with several hundred miners.After a while,a wall suddenly collapses as a huge mining drill enters the mine and frees everyone.It is Ah-nold,who announces,of course,""I'm baaack"".This allows the team to catch up to Van Damme and company at the airport before they can get away.It is there that Stallone is going to get his revenge on Van Damme for what he did to Billy.And what revenge it is.The film ends as the plane flies off into the sunset and the guys toast Billy.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a gag reel,deleted scenes,commentary and four featurettes.All in all a step up from the uneven E-1,as Stallone has gotten things right this time around,with his script,editing and pacing.Testosterone and action are maxed out to the hilt,as the guys go from one fight-fest to the next.In-jokes abound and Stallone and company are winking at us all....and we are winking back and loving it.4 1/2 stars.",4,Now THIS is more like it!,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,5038,"['Expendables', '2', 'released', 'Aug/12', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Barney', 'Ross', 'Jason',

The key complaints I got is as follows:-1. The first ten minutes of 2 is simply the mix of the all best scenes of 1. That's it. No more heavy ""blow the hell out of it"" scenes again.2. Jet Li left immediately after the first fight. I am not a die hard fan of Li but his absence largely reduced the amount of fist fight, though the small amount by Stratham using knives was still very good. The last one between Stallone and Van Dam was real bad.3. The story sucked. Of course this is an action movie people should care most about the action. However, I could not convince myself why it took over two days for Stallone to move/drive through some rural deserted villages to a Plutonium mine yet it took just a very short while for the bad guys to drive to a very modern airport in a city.4. I knew Chuck Norris was an invincible lone wolf. Yet, how could he destroy a tank and tens of gangsters armed with machine guys in five seconds that even professionals like Stallone and his team got no idea how he made it?5. The cinematography of 1 is better than 2. I guess Stallone is a much better director than Simon West.6. Worst of all, even when showering with bullets against each other face to face, only the bad guys ate the bullets.Certainly, it's awesome to see nearly all the great action stars of the 80's in the same film!

1482372,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B005LAII58,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[0, 0]","""I'm back"" declares Arnold Schwarzenegger mid-way through the Expendables 2 and for a lot of people that is music to their ears. Action stars of the past galore unite to do what they do best, kick butt and look damnably cool while doing. Could you ask for anything more, well a better question is would you ask for anything more of a movie like the Expendables 2. If your answer is a fist in the air defiant rebel yell of HELL NO!, then  you are the right audience for this movie.A lot of people will not enjoy the Expendables 2, you know who you are and if your reading this, you probably shouldn't be. I admit with only marginal embarrassment to be an unabashed enthusiast of this sort of old school entertainment, I was born at the tail end of the 70's and grew up in the VHS era that was dominated by mindless actioners from the big muscled, big gun totting, ass whopping tough guys of ol' with names like Arnold, Sly, Chuck, Bruce, Dolph, Jean-Claude, and they all have assembled here for what could have been an embarrassing 21st century variation of ""the over the Hill Gang"", instead it is a sort of middle age and beyond version of the Avengers, only it's live action.The story isn't much, just enough to get the guys from one big bang to another big boom. The expendables are a team of mercenaries who are recruited for a new mission by their friendly nemesis Mr. Church (Bruce Willis), who is hanging a prison sentence over their head based around their exploits from the previous film. So team leader Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) reunites his guys, including Lee Christmas (Jason Statham),  Gunnar Jenson (Dolph Lundgren), Toll Road (Randy Couture) and Hail Caesar (Terry Crews), to lead them into certain danger to retrieve a none too well defined package.Another group, these ones of  badies lead by super villain named Villain, say it with a French ascent, played by the mussels from Brussels himself, Jean-Claude Van Damme also want the devise. This results in the death of the team's youngest member, Billy Timmons (Liam Hemsworth), just before his retirement and eminent settling down.Now, Barney and his team engage in what one character refers to as ""male patterned badness"" to find the bad guys and extract a little sweet revenge. They also need to carry out their original mission, I suppose, but that all takes a back set to their retribution. Joined by wondering mercs Booker (Chuck Norris) and Trench (Schwarzenegger), the boys are good to go. They don't draw first blood, but they die hard and terminate with extreme prejudice.The movie is something of an improvement over it's well liked, but unloved predecessor for a number of reasons. Not that it has any more depth or live affirming sentiments, who needs them. This flick is an apologetic testosterone fuelled macho bullcrap at it's zenith. It is also a whole lot of fun to watch, the cast is game and enjoying every minute of it. The script is full of  silly in-jokes, cheeky humor and hilariously bad dialogue. It's more fun than the first film and has a lighter tone. It moves at a rapid fire pace that doesn't allow the audience's attention to wander far. It's also not just purely a bloodfest, in fact the on screen bloodletting is kept to a minim in the name of good taste, but works as a rousing adventure tail too. So often action pictures forget that they belong to the larger genre heading of action/adventure.Stallone does look old here, though, and more tired than ever before. He still has star power and uses it well to over come some obvious hurdles. His final showdown with martial arts superstar Van Damme is a worthy addition to his cannon of action scenes in cinema history. Likewise Statham and rising action star Scott Adkins gets a nice, but too brief martial arts duel.The charismatic Lundgren is allowed to have a more expanded role than in the first movie that showcase a surprising talent for comic relief. Schwarzenegger. Willis and Norris have fun with their glorified cameos that allow them to kid their famous screen images.  Couture and  Crews just seem to be filling space, even more so than before. And Jet Li has nothing more than a brief appearnace in the picture's opening, although so much goes on so quickly that you may not even notice his absence. Hemsworth is an ill choice, his role is underwritten and clich&eacute;, and he looks out of place.The film is unapologetically nostalgic for it's by gone era, CGI is still kept to a minim, the boys do as much of the action as their tired old bodies will allow. The action scenes and the stunts are on par with the best the genre has to offer. Directed by Simon West, who has proven himself a truly capable director of old school action flicks with credits like Con Air and the Statham starrer the Mechanic redux. He gives the film a nice flair, pace and affectionate feel. It is all silly absurd goodness, it knows and reveals in it. Unfortunately, like too many action flicks these days it is shot in grey and gloomy Eastern Europe, unless I was mistaken and that was Detroit.Willis says of the exploits ""a little extreme, but nice."" I think that this is a sentiment shared by the enthusiastic audience awaiting this movie. There aren't very many like this any more, and there won't be again.  A relic of another time, if not a kinder and gentler one. Sly also comments about a plane looking like it belongs in a museum, to which Arnold retorts ""don't we all."" If they are not exactly national treasures, at least they are iconic legends of what they do, and let's hope they keep doing it as long as medicare covers their injuries.check out my reviews at

1482378,A1ZAL70XAQ3JRO,B005LAII58,S. Horn,"[0, 0]","I love The Expendables.  In my opinion, that movie was the perfect throwback to the 80s/90s/2000s action films, with just enough action, humor, and drama, from those decades, and just enough stars to make the movie enjoyable.  Updated 80s action with the sensibilities of today (cameos and Easter eggs, for example).  Naturally, when I heard about a sequel, with even more action, and even more retro stars, I was excited.The first big change was that Sylvester Stallone was stepping down from the director's chair.  This actually does not play in favor for the film.  Stallone brought a certain love, a passion, in the first film that the second one tries to but doesn't grab.  He literally put blood, sweat, and tears into The Expendables, and it showed with the 60+ year old performing his own stunts, and nitpicking all of the pre and post production components.  So much so, in fact, that a Director's Cut exists for the first film (that isn't as good as what was originally released, but still).  This time out, the producers decided to hire a well-known action director, Simon West, to handle production duties, leaving Stallone to lead the cast, but still handle writing duties.  Writing aside (which we'll get to in a second), West is not a bad director by any means.  The action is big, and he handles the many personalities very well.  The passion just isn't there as Stallone had with film #1.Writing duties, as mentioned before, fell back to Stallone.  This is both good and bad.  Good, in that the original writer of the screenplay from the first film is continuing the stories for the sequel.  Bad, because Stallone thought it a good idea to include entirely too many winks to previous conquests of each of the film's big stars.  One liners work in these movies, but in excess, the movie becomes campy and too laughable, something a huge action film should not be.  Arnold's ""I'm back"" and ""I'll be back"" are here (as well as a mention of him being ""terminated""), Bruce's Die Hard ""Yippee kai-yay"", and even a Chuck Norris Fact all make it into the film.  I get that he's trying to throwback the film to the good ol' days, but, getting serious for a minute, the minimal use of retro action humor and mere teases of the past in the first film were enough to remind fans of those old school action films.  Too much is overkill.  The one liner, action star dialogue highlight belongs to Stallone though, who proclaims: ""That's how we deal with death. We keep it light, until it's time to go dark. Then we go pitch black.""  Just enough of ridiculous humor and macho bravado to make me crack a smile.There are action stars aplenty on display, with the cast of the first film (minus Mickey Rourke) all back.  Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis get bigger roles, action icons Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme get added to the fray, and we also get some young names in Liam Hemsworth and Yu Nan.  Stallone and Jason Statham get the most to do, like the first film.  Dolph Lundgren gets a bit more to do, but the writing of his character doesn't necessarily mean that is a good idea.  Do we really believe that his character, Gunnar, is as goofy as he is portrayed on screen?  Most disappointing is the extended cameo that Jet Li gets, only popping up in the first 10-15 minutes, and then dropping out.  Not only does this not really make sense, but it also doesn't fully utilize one of the film's main characters and members of the mercenary group, and a martial arts mastermind, in the process.  Some guys are a little rusty too, as Chuck Norris' big introduction is merely an extended wink-wink and pat on the back for the 70 year old action star.  Arnold's first big role after his Governor-ship in California shows the wear on his tires, as he is obviously trying too hard to read his lines, and his timing is off in nearly every scene he's in.  New cast member Hemsworth is an interesting character that doesn't get as much room to breathe.  It's nice to see a female join the men in the action scenes, but Yu Nan is reduced to hitting on old man Stallone by the end of the movie.  I also would have liked to see Randy Couture get more to do.  His buddy-buddy scenes with Terry Crews work, and the humor works for Crews, who gets to flex his comedic muscles (sometimes a bit too much).  Jean-Claude's villain, aptly named Jean Vilain, is cool, and fitting for the film's large cast set against him.  His 2nd-in-command, played by the always entertaining Scott Adkins, also gets a villain role, proving that the casting director is paying attention to the newer, and direct-to-DVD action stars as well.The movie is not terrible by any stretch, it just needs some work.  The opening action scene is great (especially the Jet Li kitchen utensils martial arts fight), as is the final airport battle, where we get everyone fighting against Van Damme's group of bad guys.  We get shots of Stallone firing weapons with Arnold and Bruce, Chuck Norris popping up shooting a villain while he lays inside an airport security x-ray machine, and one-on-one fights between Statham and Adkins (which is underrated and brief, they are both great here), and of course, the mano e mano between Stallone and Van Damme (which simultaneously shows their age, despite them having enough left in the tank to deliver another solid match-up).  The action lives up to expectations.  My complaints come in to the added effects, as a lot of the sets look like they were produced on a sound-stage (they were), and the blood effects added in post-production looks cheesy and cheap.  Aren't these guys famous for movies using blood squibs?  And how come the cussing has to be downplayed so much?  Some of the best lines of those classic action movies allow anything to be said, without giving a F about anything.The extras on the Blu-Ray release are similar to the ones found on the first film's home release.  There are documentaries and making of features.  Deleted scenes and gag reels show some footage that was left on the production floor:  some good (extended fight scenes for Couture, Crews, Lundgren, and Nan), and some bad (professional tennis player, Novak Djokovic, fights villains in the airport with a tennis racket... seriously).  There's digital copies available in the package too.All in all, the movie works, but goes a little overboard in it's final delivery.  Less is more, as proven by the unfairly underrated first movie.  The humor works, but when it's toned down, and allowed to breath more than being force-fed down the viewer's throat by aging action stars.  Let the film be filmed as R-rated from the beginning, and give fans what they want without going too far into the CGI department on the action scenes.  Less is more, especially for a movie that has as many action stars as this one.  I just hope The Expendables 3 takes the good from the first 2 movies, and shaves off the fat.",3,Unpopular opinion alert:  The first one is better.

First and foremost, Stallone just looks like a goombah, talks like one and should retire from movies altogether.  As for the story, such as it is, you can see everything that's going to happen a mile away.  Not going to give you a spoiler alert, since the movie spoils itself.The kid ""Billy"".....no pun...getting himself caught was totally expected.  Then, as throughout the movie, the main cast does exactly what they shouldn't in the situations they get into....and thus continues the movie instead of ending right then.  Example one....Billy gets caught...bad guys threaten to kill him unless the guys put down their weapons....(here comes ""DERRRPPPP"" moment #1)...they did...and they killed the kid anyway.  Wow...not like we didn't fully expect THAT to happen. Lesson...shoot the bad guys when you have the chance...they will never not kill the hostage.In a scene where they're running out of room and Stallone is yelling ""CLIMB...CLIMB"" in a rickety airplane....of course they just climb out of danger at the last possible second...or that would be the end of the movie...and what probably would happen in any other circumstance or real life.  Later, as our enemies pull into the CGI cave having crossed a bridge I swear they used in STRIPES...our heroes crash an airplane into said CGI cave, for which they have no idea how deep it is, and manage not to completely obliterate the plane itself....fuel doesn't explode...the plane doesn't fall apart completely like any airplane crash in history.  A bit way too past suspension of disbelief for me.  Later....too much later...when Stallone confronts the cliche enemy with the funky accent, he is challenged to fight ""like a man"" and does the movie-obligatory thing and drops all his weapons instead of just shooting the enemy like he should have...or you and I would have...or anyone with half a brain would have...so we can see how a man fights, I guess....and stabs the bad guy with the same knife we saw that killed Billy the Kid earlier in the movie after seeming to be about to lose....so as to be somehow poetic justice.This movie was just roiling in cliches and bad one-liners (I'll be back...Yippee Ki-Yay and many more).

I'm not sure if this is because of the source material (from what I've read it IS the source) or the encode. For a movie made &#34;today,&#34; this is quite disappointing.That being said, what is presented doesn't look horrible.

I would say that while the video isn't a showcase for your amazing system, the audio certainly is for your surround sound system.Extras:Commentary, Look at the cast, look at the 80s action film, a look at the weaponry used in the film, look at real world mercenaries, a gag reel and a few extended/deleted scenes.

1482424,A256QKS1DIQ54U,B005LAII58,T. Bollinger,"[3, 6]","I remember sitting in the theatre on August 13th, 2010 on my birthday in eager anticipation of the big, dumb fun to come in the form of Sylvester Stallone's '80&#8242;s action-tribute/ensemble movie, `The Expendables.' Fortunately, it was mostly everything I had hoped for: Big, powerful, bloody, gritty, unapologetic action interspersed with pretty laughable dialogue. Despite how pathetic that film often was whenever people weren't shooting each other, the original `Expendables' was still a good action movie because it nailed the right pacing and was able to etch out the right rhythm of bloody excitement and tough guys awkwardly shooting the breeze. Despite what all the highbrow critics thought, that movie worked both because of and in spite of Stallone's writing. It's sequel, however, does not.Somewhere in all the boringness of watching Stallone's latest cinematic effort, called `The Expendables 2,' I actually paused the movie to find out where exactly my friend and I were in the film because of how little action and how much boring, terrible dialogue there was. After nearly sixty minutes out of the film's 103 minute length, we had had exactly one action scene (all the way back at the beginning), and the rest of the schlock had been nothing more than Stallone's and Richard Wenk's awful, painful dialogue. The film went on for another five minutes or so before we finally got a quick action scene that wrapped up with a incredibly brief appearance of Chuck Norris, although I don't think we actually got to see him shoot anything.This is pretty much what the entire movie is. Although thankfully the snail's pace does pick up a noticeable amount in the movie's final third, most of E2 will simply bore you to tears, and given all the action and star power we were promised (including extended appearances by Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Bruce Willis, and Arnold Schwarzenegger), that is simply unacceptable. For the most part, the problem is the pacing, as I mentioned. We all knew that the dialogue was going to be bad coming into this, so it wasn't like we were expecting some Shakespearean or Dickensian level of character development or colloquy. That's not my beef with this movie. The problem is that there is just so much of this awful, boring-ass dialogue, and hardly any action at all for the first hour of the film, and when the action finally does pick up in the airport finale, none of the shootouts or hand-to-hand combat match the violence from the first movie. That latter point is not necessarily a huge mark against E2, because the action in the original `Expendables' is pretty damn good, but given the sleep-inducing pace of most of the film, the fact that we are not absolutely blown away by the action when it does happen is disappointing. Really the only action scene that is up to par with the over-the-top violence of the original is in the opening scene.With that said, the action is still better than average, and I will take anything over the awful line delivery and forced jokes that make up most of the movie. I have a hard time deciding which particular conversation is the worst in E2, since they are all pretty awful and there are a lot of them. Some of the terrible jokes stick out more than the regular ""character growth"" moments, though. Dolph Lundgren's pathetic running attempts at comedic relief as a former chemical engineer or a math wiz or a super-genius or something (I don't remember what it was) is pretty bad, but so is the incredibly forced Chuck Norris joke about a cobra. I don't know, it's just all so boring and bad, and the fact that there is just so much of it makes it all the more irritating.As for the film's impressive lineup, that too is letdown. Willis and Schwarzenegger actually do some shooting in this movie, which is a small plus, but we don't see Norris actually shoot a guy on screen until the finale, and Jet Li leaves after the opening battle scene less than half an hour into the movie. And yes, before you interject, Van Damme does something cool...at the very end of the story for three minutes. Jesus, Stallone, if a cast member has less than fifteen minutes of screen time, or kills fewer than ten people, can you please not bill them as a ""starring role?""I don't know. I guess I just feel so cheated by the whole affair, and that's pretty pathetic considering that the action is pretty hard-hitting when it finally occurs (despite being underwhelming compared to the original). The first hour of E2 is so bad, and it's all because we have to watch a bunch of heavily muscled, macho, '80&#8242;s throwback guys pretending to be dramatic actors, when they should've stuck to what they did best and shot first and asked questions later. It would have been better than whatever the hell this is. Don't let people tell you that `The Expendables 2&#8242; is a revamped version of the original '80&#8242;s tribute. It's not. If anything, it's a watered down, lazy, half-assed version of the 2010 flick. It feels eerily like the outtakes from that movie, as if Simon West and Stallone simply took all the unused, cut footage from `The Expendables' and strung it together, and repackaged it to make another movie. It might as well be.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SCORE: 3/10+ The action is pretty solid...- ...when it actually happens. So much of the film is dedicated to boring, lazy, awful, sleep-inducing dialogue that goes on forever. The pacing in E2 is its greatest sin. And it's a big one.- Heck, this movie gets a con just for including that half-assed, pathetic Norris joke and Lundgren's ""super-genius"" gag.- Norris, Van Damme, and Li are disappointingly underused, and Yu is annoyingly overused. Come on guys, really?? This movie was like watching `Rocky V' (1990).

Did my theater cut out a scene?Church (Bruce Willis) sends our group on a new mission which includes the new guy Bill the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) who wants to make this his last mission. As a loyal Trekkie I already knew what was going to happen to the new guy in the landing party. This then leads to a ""payback"" mission over an improbable scenario written by someone who knows nothing about the handling and storage of weapons grade plutonium.The film attempts to force new memorable lines on us like ""Rest in Pieces"" which made me cringe. Arnold and Norris provide some cameo appearances with Jean-Claude Van Damme playing the bad guy...not just any bad guy but one with a Satanic goat tattoo on his neck. Seriously?Stallone has done better.

1482455,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B005LAII58,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[3, 5]","In the follow up to The Expendables Sylvester Stallone and company carry on their fun conceit of gathering several recognizable and big star actors mostly from shoot 'em up action fare and return the majority of them to the screen and add a couple of faces to this outing.  Major players in this movie are again Stallone and Statham.  Also getting an ample amount of screen time are returners Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, and Randy Couture, while the (unbelievable) love interest/ sex appeal this time around is Nan Yu, someone who will be new to the majority of moviegoers.  Round 2 avoids cameos, giving a bit more screen time to some of the past film's cameo stars, such as Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzeneggar, and gives the funnest portions to Chuck Norris.  But it also greatly diminishes Jet Li's screen time though he is given one good physically active sequence.  Rounding out the players who get a decent amount of screen time are Liam Hemsworth (who plays the young and alive heart of the team of the Expendables), and villains played by Jean Claude Van Damme and Scott Adkins.So anyone who doesn't automatically know what type of movie this is obviously isn't familiar with the typical fare of most of these movie stars.  If any of those persons are reading this review know that this movie is a hyper violent shoot, blow up, knife, and bludgeon people to death movie.  If you can't get past that description then know this movie isn't for you.  For everyone else just know that there is more blood, more spatter, more flying limbs and severed heads than you can shake a stick at.  It's really quite ridiculous and often times laugh-out-loud funny.  Fans will absolutely love the introduction to Chuck Norris' character.  I'll leave it at that.  The movie is paper thin on plot: in order to re-introduce us to the characters we are treated to the group of mercs known as the Expendables as they rescue a couple of guys.  After this rescue mission goes off without a hitch they celebrate but are soon given an assignment that they have no choice of passing up.  You know the type: get the secret information before it falls into the wrong hands.  Well, surprise! surprise!  It falls into the wrong hands.  Someone gets killed and they get stumped.  So they spend the rest of the movie, in the words of Sly's leader Barney Ross toward the bad guys, ""We're gonna hunt 'em, find 'em, and kill 'em.""  You can probably guess the ending.For fans interested in the hand-to-hand side of combat and who fights who there isn't much by way of star-on-star action.  There are several scenes where our bad boys physically beat down any number of unrecognizable bad guys but the main character on character fights are: Statham's Lee Christmas vs. Scott Adkins' Hector and Sly's Barney Ross vs. Van Damage's aptly named Vilain.This movie is far funnier, both intentionally and unintentionally, than the first outing.  There are one-liners being fired off practically as fast as the guns in this film.  Some of the better lines that I remember are: when Arnold wants a big gun he goes for the one that super-buff Terry Crews is holding and Crews tells Arnie, ""If I don't get this back your a** is terminated.""  Dolph Lundgren quips to Randy Couture before setting off an explosion, ""Better cover your ear.""  (Minor spoiler ahead)  When Li is about to exit the group Lundgren, who viciously fought Li in the first movie and constantly harped on his diminutive stature, says, ""Who am I supposed to pick on now?""  Li retorts, ""You'll find another minority.""  In the climactic fight scene Van Damme tells Sly, ""I'm outta bullets.""  Sly scuffs, ""That's your problem.""  And my personal favorite is when Sly tells Norris, ""I heard that you got bit by a king cobra.""  Norris nods his head affirmatively, ""Yes, but after five days of agonizing pain...the cobra died.""  If any of these little scenarios made you smile or laugh then you should have a few more smiles and laughs as you watch the movie.  It might not be worth full fare at the theaters but you'll want to check it out in some way.My final thought is this: there probably won't be an Expendables 3 unless they tap some new blood and make a more serious, and smarter, action flick.  These older stars are fun to watch but the conceit of this film does start to fall flat.  I hate to say this but Arnold looks practically arthritic!  But maybe fans can petition Stallone with some fresh (or at least fun) ideas.  It's worth a try!  Put your ideas in the comment's section below.

1482476,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005LAII58,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","""The Expendables 2"" is an ultimate old-school action flick. No more, no less. Directed by Simon West (known for ""Con Air"" and ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider""), the action-packed sequel to the 2010 hit knows what it is doing. With bloody killings and self-deprecating humor, the film provides nice thrills and a few laughs.So, the ""Expendables"" are back in action, with the opening sequence about their rescue mission in Nepal. Simon West wastes no time in setting the film's tone, effectively staging an action sequence that is gory and violent. Obviously ""The Expendables 2"" is going to be bigger and louder, and that is exactly what we want from a sequel.The main story kicks in when Bruce Willis' CIA operative arrives, forcing Sylvester Stallone's Barney Ross to reunite the Expendables including Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), Toll Road (Randy Couture) and Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), as well as newly recruited Billy the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) and Maggie (Nan Yu), an agent Church sends in, in order to retrieve something that is supposed to be in a recently crashed plane in Albania. The team's mission goes awry when another mercenary group led by Jean-Claude Van Damme's Vilain - yes, that's his name - interrupts.The rest of the story is, as Barney says, ""Track em, find em and kill em."" What else do we need to know? Arnold Schwarzenegger is back (and proudly says so, just like he always did. Chuck Norris appears briefly, with one Chuck Norris fact quoted by himself. As to martial arts action, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Scott Adkins as his right-hand man deliver some solid action scenes. A knife-wielding Jason Statham is also impressive. Jet Li has one great combat sequence.""The Expendables 2"" does exactly what it sets out to do with lots of action, and the fact that the cast is clearly having fun makes the film more entertaining.",5,(4.5 STARS) Ultimate Old-school Action Flick,1350691200,"10 20, 2012",2012,1842,"['Expendables', '2', 'ultimate', 'old-school', 'action', 'flick', 'more', 'less', 'Directed', 'Simon', 'West', 'known', 'Con', 'Air', 'Lara', 'Croft', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'action-packed', 'sequel', '2010', 'hit', 'what', 'doing', 'bloody', 'killings', 'self-deprecating', 'humor', 'film', 'nice', 'thrills', 'few', 'laughs.So', 'Expendables', 'are', 'back', 'action', 'opening', 'sequence', 'rescue', 'mission', 'Nepal', 'Simon', 'West', 'time', 'setting', 'film', 'tone', 'effectively', 'staging', 'action', 'sequence', 'gory', 'violent', 'Obviously', 'Expendables', '2', 'going', 'be', 'bigger', 'louder', 'exactly', 'what', 'want', 'sequel.The', 'main', 'story', 'kicks', 'when', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'CIA', 'operative', 'arrives', 'forcing', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Barney', 'Ross', 'reunite', 'Expendables', 'including', 'Hale', 'Caesar', 'Terry', 'Crews', 'Toll', 'Road', 'Randy', 'Couture', 'Gunner', 'Jensen', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'as', 'well', 'newly', 'recruited', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'Liam', 'Hemsworth', 'Maggie', 'Nan', 'Yu', 'agent', 'Church', 'order', 'retrieve', 'something', 'supposed', 'be', 'recently', 'crashed', 'plane', 'Albania', 'team', 'mission', 'awry', 'when', 'mercenary', 'group', 'led', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Vilain', 'yes', 'name', 'interrupts.The', 'rest', 'story', 'Barney', 'Track', 'em', 'find', 'em', 'kill', 'em', 'What', 'else', 'do', 'need', 'know', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'back', 'proudly', 'so', 'just', 'always', 'did', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'briefly', 'one', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'fact', 'quoted', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Scott', 'Adkins', 'right-hand', 'man', 'deliver', 'solid', 'action', 'scenes', 'knife-wielding', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'also', 'impressive', 'Jet', 'Li', 'one', 'great', 'combat', 'sequence', 'Expendables', '2', 'exactly', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'lots', 'action', 'fact', 'cast', 'clearly', 'having', 'fun', 'film', 'more', 'entertaining']",N/A

Completing the line-up is the legendary Chuck Norris making a great cameo appearance as the lone wolf.Ross (Stallone) is approached by CIA man Mr Church (Willis), who calls in his favour and tasks 'The Expendables' to go to the former Soviet Union to retrieve something that was on a crashed plane. The team find the package but are then ambushed and have their sniper killed by the aptly named Vilain (Van Damme), who leads a group called 'The Sangs'. And so begins a chase to stop Vilain find the buried plutonium and sell it - with some great battles and climaxes.

The addition of Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris, as well as the greatly expanded roles of Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwartzenegger, more than make-up for the lack of Mickey Rourke and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The action scenes and special effects are just as over-the-top (in a good way) as they were in the first picture. If you are looking for non-stop action and some cheesy dialogue from some of the 20th century's biggest and best action stars, you won't be disappointed.Those of you looking for a coherent plot, articulate dialogue or not being subjected to actors for whom English is a second (or third) language will obviously want to skip watching this movie. This flick is just pure fun for grownups who never quite outgrew their favorite action stars.The only real criticism of the movie worth mentioning (for those of you who can appreciate the true potential the movie had with such an all-star line-up) is the fact that there are a lot of missed opportunities for on-screen showdowns we all would have loved to have seen. Like a martial arts battle between Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris, or Jet Li, for that matter. Whether it was due to bad scripting, inflated egos, Hollywood politics or just because these guys were too old to pull-off such demanding scenes, we'll probably never know. The most recent flicks I have seen from Jean-Claude Van Damme and Jet Li would seem to suggest that at least those two could have done some great work together.

1482530,AP3B615GM191G,B005LAII58,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[5, 7]","The first ""Expendables"" film was a ""tale of two halves"": The first half is a jovial get-together of some of the greatest on-screen action heroes of all-time.  However, after a rather strange speech by Mickey Rourke, the film turns really serious and loses much of its built-up energy.  In the case of ""Expendables 2"", however, the wise-cracking ""buddy"" formula is in place all the way through and it makes it much easier to enjoy from start to finish.For a basic plot summary, ""Expendables 2"" brings the old gang of Stallone, Statham, Li, Crews, Lundgren, & Couture back into a caper involving stolen plutonium.  This time, however, the group is joined by Liam Hemsworth and Nan Yu.  Along the way, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger stop in to beef up their roles from the original, while legendary action icons such as Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme also have important roles.  A lot of bullets are expended, a lot of things explode, and a lot of biceps are strained.Noticed how I didn't mention any actual character names above?  That is exactly by design, as in this film franchise all the actors are essentially playing caricatures of themselves (or at least of their former on-screen personas).  That is actually what makes the formula work so well, as back in the 80s all these guys were ""competing"" with each other, and now they are all on screen together!  The one-liners and male camaraderie are almost worth the price of admission alone.Why ""just"" three stars as a rating, then?  Well, depending on your taste in movies, you may like this one a lot more or a lot less.  I'm not a huge fan of pure-action flicks, but at the same time I loved seeing ""the old gang"" get together, so I could enjoy this one (if not at 4 or 5-star levels).  If explosions and gunfire are your cup of tea, however, then this one will jump a star or perhaps even two.Overall, ""Expendables 2"" is a step up from the original that uses a looser, more comedic tone to keep audience interest.

Why the hell would I want to see Van Damme simply strutting around as a charismatic bad guy?  Fight!!!  Fight Lundgren.  Fight Jet Li.  Fight Terry Crews.  I watch this movie to see legendary match-ups with choreographed brilliance.  In this flop, the great Van Damme fights Stallone at the end for about 2 minutes.  What the hell is that?Lundgren got a chance to shine as a thespian as well, his expressions priceless, BUT . . . who wrote the dialogue to this movie?  The gods of action are forced to spew the stupidest, inane, worthless, pointless phrases!!!!!  It degrades our American action legends!The young sniper is a blatant plot tool.  And he fires a sniper rifle faster than a double-action revolver.  Impossible.  Who advised this film?The guys barely fight all of the goons sent their way.  Instead there is a ton of gunfire.  Spraying and praying.  Why the hell do I want to see these action stars shooting guns the whole damn time?Remember that epic battle between Lundgren and Li in Expendables?  Remember that match between Stone Cold and Stallone?  Nothing like that in this film.  Jet Li is the best in this film, but he is in the film for a couple minutes kicking major butt creatively.  Then he literally jumps out of the film.  Statham has a nice scene as a priest, murdering a few guys.  Terry Crews throws a few goons around creatively.  But there is one villain of note, who never fights any of the other Expendables one-on-one.  What good is that?  Don't you want to see Statham vs. Van Damme?  Don't you want to see Li vs. Van Damme?  They really dropped the ball.  Hey, try paying a few famous MMA guys to be Van Damme's henchman and pit them one on one vs the Expendables!This film has a few exciting violent scenes.  It has too little hand-to-hand combat.  It is a bullet-fest.  If I wanted that, I could watch a million mediocre films with nobody actors.This is a collection of the gods of action, and all we get is a silly shoot-out with impossible shots made.  If I wanted magic, I'd watch Harry Potter.And please do not mention the ridiculous and corny Chuck Norris scenes.  He shows up for NO REASON, rescues them with magic bullet sprays and missile launches out of thin air, has corny music, NEVER FIGHTS ANYONE, and has dialogue that sounds barely more useful than a blast of diarrhea.I am so disappointed with Expendables 2.  I love these stars.  Each one of them.  I respect their skills, and I KNOW they can kick major butt creatively with great spectacle.  Instead, I got a POORLY WRITTEN, plot-less, bore with child-like dialogue.  The actors are obviously trying to be entertaining.  They succeed in their expressions, body language, etc.  But the script gave them a tasty heap of dung to speak and a paper-thin unreasonable plot that nobody cares about.How can these guys come from excellent movies like the Transporter series, the Rambo series, Predator, the Die Hard series, and so on--and YET accept this poorly-written poop-fest with guns???????Imagine Bruce Willis trying to take on Van Damme or a drunken Lundgren?  How cool would that be to see?  Imagine Arnold and Stallone duking it out over some plot twist?  How awesome would that be?  Imagine Jet Li and Statham teaming up vs. a ton of guys.  How about Terry Crews brawling against Van Damme?  How about Chuck Norris fighting his way out of a paper bag, if he still can?We get none of that.  We get a glorified day at the gun range.  So, I swallow my love for these legends, and declare Expendables 2 barely mediocre entertainment.  And it hurts to say that.  The first one is way better than this one.  Van Damme was wasted.

While The Expendables 2 is far from great, it's definitely a step up from the first one. This time around, the whole film is actually centered on all the members of The Expendables on a mission instead of focusing only one character like the first one did. The action is much better filmed this time and the action sequences are an absolute blast to watch. The film also recognizes what it is and is full of cheesy one-liners and jokes. However, a huge problem with the film is that it drags a lot in the middle and there's a period where for what feels like quite sometime there is no action in the film. I enjoyed seeing the actors all hang out and crack jokes, but after a while it grew tiresome and I wanted to see them get back to the action. What we do get in the end pays off, but this movie really did need more action than what it did deliver.
