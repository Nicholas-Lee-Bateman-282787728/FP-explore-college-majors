996705,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000FVQLIO,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","House Season Two, 2005-06This set has twenty-four episodes on six single-sided DVDs. The stories are set in a hospital located in New Jersey near Princeton. Gregory House MD is a modern version of ""Sherlock Holmes"", a character who is shown to be most observant and knowledgeable than his co-workers. The camera is the ""Dr. Watson"" to record the events. ""Everybody lies"" is his slogan. House acts and does what he wishes (as if he owned the business). Would his temper tantrums fly in the real world? Would his pill popping also be acceptable? [A nurse once told me she hated this show because it was so false to what she saw in her workplace. I told her Hollywood makes drama and entertainment, a non-fiction book reality.] This show has a very high amount of drama and personal conflicts. Is that its attraction? A patient arrives at a hospital. There are conflicts about the diagnosis. Finally Dr. House correctly diagnoses the problem so it can be cured. This is the recurring plot, as regular as in the ""Perry Mason"" shows.Watching this show is not a substitute for seeing a doctor for any problem. The important lesson here is that a problem cannot be solved until it is correctly diagnosed. Think of that when you read opinions in the newspapers or hear opinions on the radio or television. Do they really know what they're talking about? Or are they just putting out lies or half-truths to promote an agenda that they are being paid to do? How many people die yearly from a mistake in their prescriptions? How many people die each year from a doctor's mistake? [These figures are not readily available.] For comparison there are about 31,000 deaths each year from firearms in this country (about 1 in 10,000). Before the 1968 Federal Gun Control Law this figure was about half. Motor vehicle deaths are much higher (there are more of them in use every day). The actual rate is more informative than a simple count. This show, like some foods, is best taken in small doses.Disc 1 has four episodes:""Acceptance""; ""Autopsy""; ""Humpty Dumpty""; ""TB or not TB"".Disc 2 has four episodes:""Daddy's Boy""; ""Spin""; ""Hunting""; ""The Mistake"".Disc 3 has four episodes:""Deception""; ""Failure to Communicate""; ""Need to Know""; ""Distractions"".Disc 4 has four episodes:""Skin Deep""; ""Sex Kills""; ""Clueless""; ""Safe"".Disc 5 has four episodes:""All In""; ""Sleeping Dogs Lie""; ""House vs. God""; ""Euphoria - Part 1"".Disc 6 has four episodes:""Euphoria - Part 2""; ""Forever""; ""Who's Your Daddy?""; ""No Reason"".",5,Drama in a Hospital Setting,1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,2483,"['House', 'Season', 'Two', '2005-06This', 'set', 'twenty-four', 'episodes', 'six', 'single-sided', 'DVDs', 'stories', 'are', 'set', 'hospital', 'located', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Princeton', 'Gregory', 'House', 'MD', 'modern', 'version', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'character', 'who', 'shown', 'be', 'most', 'observant', 'knowledgeable', 'co-workers', 'camera', 'Dr.', 'Watson', 'record', 'events', 'Everybody', 'slogan', 'House', 'what', 'owned', 'business', 'Would', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'fly', 'real', 'world', 'Would', 'pill', 'popping', 'also', 'be', 'acceptable', '[', 'nurse', 'once', 'told', 'hated', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'false', 'what', 'saw', 'workplace', 'told', 'Hollywood', 'drama', 'entertainment', 'non-fiction', 'book', 'reality', ']', 'show', 'very', 'high', 'amount', 'drama', 'personal', 'conflicts', 'attraction', 'patient', 'hospital', 'are', 'conflicts', 'diagnosis', 'Finally', 'Dr.', 'House', 'correctly', 'problem', 'can', 'be', 'cured', 'recurring', 'plot', 'as', 'regular', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'shows.Watching', 'show', 'not', 'substitute', 'seeing', 'doctor', 'problem', 'important', 'lesson', 'here', 'problem', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'solved', 'correctly', 'diagnosed', 'Think', 'when', 'read', 'opinions', 'newspapers', 'hear', 'opinions', 'radio', 'television', 'Do', 'really', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'are', 'just', 'putting', 'out', 'lies', 'half-truths', 'promote', 'agenda', 'are', 'being', 'paid', 'do', 'How', 'many', 'people', 'die', 'yearly', 'mistake', 'prescriptions', 'How', 'many', 'people', 'die', 'year', 'doctor', 'mistake', 'figures', 'are', 'not', 'readily', 'available', ']', 'comparison', 'are', '31,000', 'deaths', 'year', 'firearms', 'country', '1', '10,000', '1968', 'Federal', 'Gun', 'Control', 'Law', 'figure', 'was', 'half', 'Motor', 'vehicle', 'deaths', 'are', 'much', 'higher', 'are', 'more', 'use', 'day', 'actual', 'rate', 'more', 'informative', 'simple', 'count', 'show', 'foods', 'best', 'taken', 'small', 'doses.Disc', '1', 'four', 'episodes', 'Acceptance', 'Autopsy', 'Humpty', 'Dumpty', 'TB', 'not', 'TB', '.Disc', '2', 'four', 'episodes', 'Daddy', 'Boy', 'Spin', 'Hunting', 'Mistake', '.Disc', '3', 'four', 'episodes', 'Deception', 'Failure', 'Communicate', 'Need', 'Know', 'Distractions', '.Disc', '4', 'four', 'episodes', 'Skin', 'Deep', 'Sex', 'Kills', 'Clueless', 'Safe', '.Disc', '5', 'four', 'episodes', 'Sleeping', 'Dogs', 'Lie', 'House', 'vs.', 'God', 'Euphoria', 'Part', '1', '.Disc', '6', 'four', 'episodes', 'Euphoria', 'Part', '2', 'Forever', 'Who', 'Daddy', 'Reason']",House: Season Two

When I received my copy of season two, i raced through watching this box set. I am ready for season threeOne of the  problems I had with this season  was the unusing during this season of the talented actress Sela Ward. She held her own against Hugh Lurie's House in the episodes she was in. When she vanished and her arc was finished, it was a let down.Last year there was a sub plot about a spy in House's close knit group of doctors. This year's sub plot was focused on actor Omar Epps's character Foreman who became  House's  boss for a few episodes and his serious illness in the two part episode Euphoria,(one of the season's best). The problem Foreman  seemed almost  healed by the next episode Forever.This series second season was stronger than the first. If you like the show, this is something akin to Godfather II to be better than the original...and if that is true season three (the new season ) must be a killer! The second season opener ""Acceptance"" (with LL Cool J), the two parter ""Euphoria"" and final episode ""No Reason"" is worth the price of  DVD box set alone..and you get 20 more episodes as a bonus!For fans of audio commentary, there are two by the producers David Shore (who also wrote and directed the season two final episode ""No Reason"").Also for EXTRA fans,  there are outtakes, deleted seasons and a small version of the cast of House at the Broadcasting Museum discussionSo what are you waiting for?

996716,A2YAABMT80RLYA,B000FVQLIO,Ben Rowland,"[4, 4]","I have never found medical dramas to be very interesting or exciting, and I am among the few people in my circle who was not swept away in the big ER craze of the mid-1990's. However, I was attracted to House MD because of British actor Hugh Laurie, who I have been a fan of since his days in Blackadder and A Bit of Fry and Laurie, and now I am firmly hooked on the show. The combination of fine acting and razor sharp writing roped me in, and now I am longing for Season 3 to come out on DVD!The namesake of the series is Dr. Gregory House, played to dramatic and comedic perfection by Laurie. He is as eccentric as they come - sarcastic, uncaring, and totally devoid of social skills. However, he is a medical genius, and he solves with relative ease what other doctors cannot even scratch the surface of. Each show follows a standard formula - patient falls ill, original diagnosis is incorrect, patient gets worse, Dr. House and his team attempt to solve it, they guess wrong the first time, but at the end Dr. House identifies the cause of the illness and all is well. In between, we see how Dr. House and his team interact, and this is where season two stands out. If season one had a weakness, it was that the character development was limited to their daily lives in the hospital. In season two, we see more personality coming out of the main characters. We see what Dr. House is like to live with, we meet Foreman's father, and we see things get hot between Chase and Cameron. By far the most interesting scenes involve Dr. House living with his one and only friend, Dr. Wilson, who seems to value their friendship despite Dr. House's lack of tact and compassion. Equally compelling is Dr. House and his relationship with his ex, Stacey.I bought this DVD set for the show alone, so I am not too disappointed by the lack of quality extras. There are a few alternate takes, a 6 minute blooper reel in which we see the cast blowing their lines, and a dull 20 minute chat session titled ""An Evening With House"". This consists of the producers (and some of the actors) sitting around talking about the show, with only Hugh Laurie offering the occasional insightful comment. However, the show is more than worth the price, so even without any extras, this set would be a great buy.House MD is an excellent show across the board, most notably for Hugh Laurie's excellent performance. It combines mystery, humor, and heart, and having seen both season one and two, I can say that it keeps getting better.

I must admit that I had not the slightest inkling of a fraction of an idea, that ""House, M.D"" would turn out to be this brilliant.Because that is what it is: Brilliant. Laurie plays the calculating, narcissistic, and effulgent dr. Gregory House to perfection. It is however not a one-man show and Laurie's co-stars all do a very good job playing his subordinates, friend(s), and colleagues, but especially Lisa Edelstein as House's boss Lisa Cuddy is worth of much applause.The stories are interesting and fascinating, very well written, and well played. There's just enough medical jargon to make it seem expertly confusing and realistic, yet not boring the viewer to tears. The same goes for the humour and the quick witted banter that makes out most of the dialogue. It's humorous but not comedic, it's quick but not 'this was obviously written to show how fast and witty these people are'.It is probably the best TV series for 10 or 15 years, and I honestly think it's going to be a while before anything better comes along. Series two only proves that ""House, M.D."" really is a winning formula.

996721,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B000FVQLIO,Caleb Williams,"[2, 2]","After the triumphant debut of the first season of House, many people believed it couldn't be topped. How wrong they were. Season Two not only shut up all the skeptics, it slapped them for even being doubtful. Season Two not only had the absence of the annoying character of Vogler, it gave us a deeper insight into all the characters. At the end of Season One we were introduced to House's ex Stacy. During Season Two we're given a more complex look on their past and their true relationship. The Stacy/House episodes introduce to the fans a deeper complexity to House and we see a more genuine side, rather than the typically cynical House we're used to.There is one episode which I found a bit too much and felt it was pushing to be controversial. I know it still had a point and didn't fail to entertain and give some deep meaningful message that some will miss somewhere. I'm not going to tell you the episode as you will all know it when you see it. This season also features two very tough to deal with episodes as Foreman is taken down by a life threatening disease, that even House struggles to solve.As always the show is filled with excellent quotes by House and the team. Below are some of my picks.From Episode 1: Acceptance:Foreman: ""Aren't there better ways to spend our time?""House: ""Good question. What makes a person deserving? Is a man who cheats on his wife more deserving than a man who kills his wife?""Foreman: ""Uh yeah. Actually, he is.""House: ""What about a child molester? Certainly not a good guy, but he didn't kill anybody. Maybe he can get antibiotics, but no MRIs. What about you? What medical care should you be denied for being a car thief? Tell you what: the three of you work out a list of what medical treatments a person loses based on the crime they committed. I'll review it when I get back.""From Episode 5: Daddys Boy:House: ""Gimme a reason to get out of this, and I'll tell you who started the rumor about you being a transsexual.""Cuddy: ""There is no such rumor.""House: ""There will be unless you get me out of this dinner.""From Episode 24: No Reason:House: ""Here's how life works: you either get to ask for an apology or you get to shoot people. Not both.""",5,I Love It,1217808000,"08 4, 2008",2008,2194,"['triumphant', 'debut', 'first', 'season', 'House', 'many', 'people', 'believed', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'topped', 'How', 'wrong', 'were', 'Season', 'Two', 'not', 'only', 'shut', 'up', 'skeptics', 'slapped', 'even', 'being', 'doubtful', 'Season', 'Two', 'not', 'only', 'had', 'absence', 'annoying', 'character', 'Vogler', 'gave', 'deeper', 'insight', 'characters', 'end', 'Season', 'One', 'were', 'introduced', 'House', 'ex', 'Stacy', 'Season', 'Two', ""'re"", 'given', 'more', 'complex', 'look', 'past', 'true', 'relationship', 'Stacy/House', 'introduce', 'fans', 'deeper', 'complexity', 'House', 'see', 'more', 'genuine', 'side', 'rather', 'typically', 'cynical', 'House', ""'re"", 'used', 'one', 'episode', 'found', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'felt', 'was', 'pushing', 'be', 'controversial', 'know', 'still', 'had', 'point', 'did', ""n't"", 'fail', 'entertain', 'give', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'message', 'will', 'miss', 'somewhere', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'episode', 'will', 'know', 'when', 'see', 'season', 'also', 'two', 'very', 'tough', 'deal', 'episodes', 'Foreman', 'taken', 'down', 'life', 'threatening', 'disease', 'even', 'House', 'solve.As', 'always', 'show', 'filled', 'excellent', 'quotes', 'House', 'team', 'Below', 'are', 'picks.From', 'Episode', '1', 'Acceptance', 'Foreman', 'Are', ""n't"", 'there', 'better', 'ways', 'spend', 'time', 'House', 'Good', 'question', 'What', 'person', 'deserving', 'man', 'who', 'wife', 'more', 'deserving', 'man', 'who', 'wife', 'Foreman', 'Uh', 'yeah', 'Actually', 'House', 'What', 'child', 'molester', 'Certainly', 'not', 'good', 'guy', 'did', ""n't"", 'kill', 'anybody', 'Maybe', 'can', 'get', 'antibiotics', 'MRIs', 'What', 'What', 'medical', 'care', 'should', 'be', 'denied', 'being', 'car', 'thief', 'Tell', 'three', 'work', 'out', 'list', 'what', 'medical', 'treatments', 'person', 'based', 'crime', 'committed', ""'ll"", 'review', 'when', 'get', 'back', 'Episode', '5', 'Daddys', 'Boy', 'House', 'Gim', 'reason', 'get', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'who', 'started', 'rumor', 'being', 'transsexual', 'Cuddy', 'such', 'rumor', 'House', 'will', 'be', 'get', 'dinner', 'Episode', '24', 'Reason', 'House', 'Here', 'how', 'life', 'get', 'ask', 'apology', 'get', 'shoot', 'people', 'Not']",House: Season Two
996722,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000FVQLIO,calvinnme,"[1, 1]","...and I might add medical comedy too. Part of House's appeal is that nobody since Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry is this tough, is such a professional purist who is allowed to continue practicing that profession for more than ten minutes, and last but not least has such funny one liner remarks.House is rude to his patients and avoids them whenever possible, but part of what makes him repugnant to almost everyone around him is that he is about the search for pure truth, and superficial niceties have no place in his life. He doesn't wear a lab coat, and he sports tennis shoes and a scruffy beard. Thus when he does actually talk to the patients he lays it on the line and expects them to do the same. However, they almost always lie to him, something that he says he expects and one reason he avoids contact with them in the first place.So why would such a rude unkempt character be so popular among viewers? Possibly it could be because as a nation we are sick of being lied to in every aspect of our lives by blow-dried poll-tested representatives of large corporate interests who are only interested in image, profit, and covering their backsides, and House is the antithesis of all of this.This particular season has some superb episodes. Several said they did not care for the arc with House's ex-girlfriend Stacy Warner, now married to a man with all of the s ex appeal of the Staypuffed Marshmallow Man, and who is still unable to walk while recovering from an illness that House treated him for at the end of season one. I personally liked the arc because it showed the side of House that was capable of love. Stacy has already made the admission to House that he was ""the one guy"" for her, but that there was no room in House's life for her and there was room for her in her husband's life. This sets up the possibility that House and Stacy may reunite. First, however, House has to find out the absolute truth of Stacy's relationship with her husband - and what House does to get that information costs him dearly when Stacy finds out. House does make a new friend this season - a rat living in Stacy's attic whom he names ""Steve McQueen"".As for the individual cases, they are interesting as always, but there are three episodes that really stand out. Two of them consist of the two-parter ""Euphoria"" in which Foreman is infected with a deadly disease that is of unknown origin and an unknown method of transmission. It turns out that Foreman, who is the most similar to House of any of his assistants, is different from House in one key way. He is willing to use any means necessary to preserve his life regardless of the possible future quality of that life. The final episode has House being shot by a disgruntled ex-patient. The big question left unanswered here is not so much will he survive, but will he be able to recover the use of his leg as a result of the shooting. You see, for Foreman the important issue is just staying alive, because he has no first-hand knowledge of life with chronic disability. House has been dragging around a useless but painful leg for five years now, and when the chips are down, for him just being alive isn't enough.The extra features are spread out over the discs this season and include:""An Evening with House"" featurette""It Could Be Lupus"" featuretteBlooper reelAlternate takes: the ""Valley Girl"" versionsProducer commentariesThe extra features here are better than the season one features, and I really enjoyed the commentary on the final episode ""No Reason"".

996723,A278AF56R7J86,B000FVQLIO,"C. Crockett ""Domino713""","[2, 3]","Whose house...Greg's house! It is so easy to become addicted to this intense, character driven dramedy that showcases the amazing acting talent of this ensemble cast, led by the illustrious Hugh Laurie in the title role as Dr. Gregory House.Follow Dr. House as he and his team of diagnosticians work round the clock to solve bizarre medical mysteries. Each episode brings a new and exciting medical challenge for our favorite TV docs to puzzle through. After suffering muscle death in his right leg, House experiences chronic pain (for which he regularly pops the narcotic painkiller Vicodin like they were tic-tacs), and manages to get around using a cane (which has become one of his trade-mark accessories). His constant pain, plus many other mitigating factors, make House a sarcastic, cranky, angry-with-the-world kind of man. Unfortunately for those who have to withstand his nasty demeanor, House is also a brilliant diagnostician, and an astute observor of human behavior (even going so far as to recommend to a patient whose skin has turned orange that he stop eating so many carrots, and get a good lawyer. When the patient asked why he'd need a lawyer, House unapolegetically told the man that if his wife hasn't noticed that her husband has turned a radioactive shade of orange, she's probably cheating on him and therefore distracted).Hugh Laurie's comedic turn as the cranky Dr. House is pure genius. He is the major reason this show has taken off as it has. Laurie snagged the role by filming an audition tape with a hand-held camera in a tiny, dirty bathroom. Laurie was filming on location for his movieFlight of the Phoenix (Widescreen Edition)when he heard about the role. Not wanting to miss out, he filmed an audition tape, and mailed it to the show's creators.If you don't already ownHouse, M.D. - Season One, purchase it immediately, along with this incredible season 2 set. As far as the asthetics of the set itself, I find that I like the way Season 2 is set up. Season 1 contained three discs, the type that have two sides to them so that when you are ready to watch the rest of the episodes you just flip the disc over. Season 2 contains six individual discs, three of which offer some pretty fun special features.Included in the special features are a couple alternate scenes in which Dr. Cuddy and Dr. Cameron do the same dialogue in a bubbly California valley girl dialect (it's pretty funny). There is also a compilation from all the episodes in which the doctors are doing their ""differential diagnosis"" and the auto-immune disease Lupus is thrown out as a suggestion (if you pay attention, you'll notice that the term Lupus is used often, even though there has yet to be a single episode where Lupus was the correct diagnosis). My favorite special feature would be the montage of the many goof-ups, slip-of-the-tongues, forgotten lines, made-up lines (often perpetrated by Hugh Laurie), and just general hilarity.Bottom line, while House's mantra is ""everybody lies"", it's no lie that this show is amazing, and well worth the purchase of the season box sets.""House"" airs on FOX on Tuesdays at 8:00 Central/Standard.",5,Our Favorite Cane Toting Doc is at it Again....,1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,3148,"['Whose', 'house', 'Greg', 'house', 'so', 'easy', 'become', 'addicted', 'intense', 'character', 'driven', 'dramedy', 'amazing', 'acting', 'talent', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'led', 'illustrious', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'title', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Gregory', 'House.Follow', 'Dr.', 'House', 'team', 'diagnosticians', 'work', 'clock', 'solve', 'bizarre', 'medical', 'mysteries', 'episode', 'new', 'exciting', 'medical', 'challenge', 'favorite', 'TV', 'docs', 'puzzle', 'suffering', 'muscle', 'death', 'right', 'leg', 'House', 'chronic', 'pain', 'regularly', 'narcotic', 'painkiller', 'Vicodin', 'were', 'tic-tacs', 'get', 'around', 'using', 'cane', 'become', 'one', 'trade-mark', 'accessories', 'constant', 'pain', 'many', 'other', 'mitigating', 'factors', 'make', 'House', 'sarcastic', 'cranky', 'angry-with-the-world', 'kind', 'man', 'Unfortunately', 'who', 'have', 'withstand', 'nasty', 'demeanor', 'House', 'also', 'brilliant', 'diagnostician', 'astute', 'observor', 'human', 'behavior', 'even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'recommend', 'patient', 'skin', 'turned', 'orange', 'stop', 'eating', 'so', 'many', 'carrots', 'get', 'good', 'lawyer', 'When', 'patient', 'asked', 'why', ""'d"", 'need', 'lawyer', 'House', 'unapolegetically', 'told', 'man', 'wife', ""n't"", 'noticed', 'husband', 'turned', 'radioactive', 'shade', 'orange', 'probably', 'cheating', 'therefore', 'distracted', 'Laurie', 'comedic', 'turn', 'cranky', 'Dr.', 'House', 'pure', 'genius', 'major', 'reason', 'show', 'taken', 'off', 'Laurie', 'snagged', 'role', 'filming', 'audition', 'tape', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'tiny', 'dirty', 'bathroom', 'Laurie', 'was', 'filming', 'location', 'movieFlight', 'Phoenix', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'when', 'heard', 'role', 'Not', 'wanting', 'miss', 'out', 'filmed', 'audition', 'tape', 'mailed', 'show', 'creators.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'ownHouse', 'M.D', 'Season', 'One', 'purchase', 'immediately', 'incredible', 'season', '2', 'set', 'far', 'asthetics', 'set', 'find', 'like', 'way', 'Season', '2', 'set', 'up', 'Season', '1', 'contained', 'three', 'discs', 'type', 'have', 'two', 'sides', 'so', 'when', 'are', 'ready', 'watch', 'rest', 'episodes', 'just', 'flip', 'disc', 'Season', '2', 'contains', 'six', 'individual', 'discs', 'three', 'offer', 'pretty', 'fun', 'special', 'features.Included', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'couple', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'Dr.', 'Cuddy', 'Dr.', 'Cameron', 'do', 'same', 'dialogue', 'bubbly', 'California', 'valley', 'girl', 'dialect', 'pretty', 'funny', 'also', 'compilation', 'episodes', 'doctors', 'are', 'doing', 'differential', 'diagnosis', 'auto-immune', 'disease', 'Lupus', 'thrown', 'out', 'suggestion', 'pay', 'attention', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'term', 'Lupus', 'used', 'often', 'even', 'there', 'yet', 'be', 'single', 'episode', 'where', 'Lupus', 'was', 'correct', 'diagnosis', 'favorite', 'special', 'feature', 'would', 'be', 'montage', 'many', 'goof-ups', 'slip-of-the-tongues', 'forgotten', 'lines', 'made-up', 'lines', 'often', 'perpetrated', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'just', 'general', 'hilarity.Bottom', 'line', 'House', 'mantra', 'everybody', 'lie', 'show', 'amazing', 'well', 'purchase', 'season', 'box', 'sets', 'House', 'airs', 'FOX', 'Tuesdays', '8:00', 'Central/Standard']",House: Season Two

Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), Eric Foreman (Omar Epps), and Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), his loyal friend Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), and his regularly exasperated boss Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein).In season 2, the show broke the mold a little bit and focused a little more on the backgrounds of the characters to give us a better idea of who they are and how they came to be working at the hospital.

996729,AQCQ5F0OJXMG9,B000FVQLIO,Crystal Starr Light,"[1, 1]","Dr. House is back for round 2 and hasn't lost any of the punch!  Hugh Laurie, Robert Sean Leonard, Jesse Spencer, Omar Epps, Jennifer Morrison, and Lisa Edelstein reprise their memorable roles in Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital for more medical mysteries and interhospital relational issues.A great concern for any sequel or season 2 is ""Can they pull off the success of the first movie/season?""  The answer for House is a big, confident ""YES!""  The addition of Stacy, House's ex-girlfriend, adds a unique dimension to the hospital, one that I thought wouldn't work.  Through Stacy (and House's pursuance of his now-married former girlfriend), we are able to see that House truly can love, does love, wants to love, but is afraid of love.  The scenes with House and Stacy are well done, vibrant, and impactful.  Definitely no naptime here!Other episodes (such as Euphoria and The Mistake) give us glimpses into the lives of House's team members, Drs. Cameron, Chase, and Foreman.  Through these episodes, we see their strengths, their weaknesses, their families, and why they became doctors in the first place.If you think for one moment that the writers will pull back and get lazy and let their characters slip, think twice.  The characters are just as vibrant as in Season 1, the drama just as moving, the mysteries as puzzling and House's humor just as funny and piercing.Again, if you have a faint stomach or are sensitive to sexuality in shows, this might not be for you...Add the absolutely amazing season finale that will make you wonder what does and doesn't exist, and this is definitely not a season to be missed.  Add this to your Christmas list and hope Santa thinks you've been good this year!  A must have to anyone's DVD collection!EPISODE GUIDE:""Acceptance"" - A death row inmate develops symptoms and House jumps to take on the case.  You get to see how Cameron hates to face the facts, lives in eternal hope, and believes that everyone should make an impact in the world.  4.5/5""Autopsy"" -  A young cancer patient is experiencing symptoms...but the team can't seem to find what is wrong.  I love how House questions this young girl's bravery and the hug.  5/5""Humpty Dumpty"" - A young man falls of Cuddy's roof and is unable to breath.  We get to see more of Lisa's character, how guilty she feels, and how she will do anything to remedy her mistake...which may prove detrimental!  4.5/5""TB or Not TB"" - A famous TB doctor exhibits TB symptoms, but House is sure it isn't TB.  I love seeing House irate at this man, to see Cameron think this doctor is the next best thing to Wonder Bread.  4.5/5""Daddy's Boy"" - A recent college grad experiences shock like symptoms.  Excellent episode, with the father-son relationship of the patient giving an interesting contrast to House's relationship with his parents.  5/5""Spin"" - A cyclist collapses while on a race...and it's drugs!  Cameron gets up in arms about his lying to his fans, about his drug usage.  4.5/5Brought to you by*C.S.

No disappointments here.  If anything, the stories, writing, acting and guest appearances in Season 2 of House were far superior to those of the first season.  In particular, the extraordinarily courageous and fierce performance of Hugh Laurie as House seared the screen in every episode.  He and series creator David Shore were not afraid to send their lead character down a darkening path toward self-doubt and destruction.  The show's trademark scathing wit, poignant insights, and twisty medical storytelling continue strongly evident in this second season. Complicated and nuanced portrayals by excellent supporting actors Lisa Edelstein, Robert Sean Leonard, and Omar Epps make this season one to treasure.

Relying on his unconventional methods and the three fellows under his tutelage, House (Hugh Laurie) regularly cracks difficult cases that other doctors would have given up long ago.Ironically enough, the one patient House couldn't save is himself. Seven years ago, he suffered an infarction in his thigh, undergoing a dangerous surgery in an attempt to save his life. While House did survive, he was left with constant pain -- causing him to pop Vicodin like candy, walk with a serious limp, and become filled with even more bitterness than he began with.It was largely because of this that House broke up with his longtime, live-in girlfriend, attorney Stacy Warner (Sela Ward). Since that time, she's married someone else and moved on. House claims he has, too, although his behavior indicates otherwise.Added to that, House is antisocial and always thinks outside the box; as one of his fellows once said, ""He doesn't even know where the box is."" Introspective and much too frank, House is a loner, except for the friendship of Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), a young oncologist who also works at Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital, and their boss, dean of medicine Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein).Despite the verbal abuse and eccentricity that House brings, his three fellows -- Drs. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), Eric Foreman (Omar Epps) and Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) all know that he's one of the best there is, and working with him for a few years will guarantee them their choice of jobs once they're ready to work unsupervised.Season 2 includes many guest appearances by Sela Ward as House's ex Stacy, who is hired as a hospital attorney -- causing much friction and longing between the two. There's more about Foreman's, Chase's and Cameron's backgrounds; as well as flashbacks of House's infarction. Foreman catches a deadly disease from a Patient of the Week, and the season's cliffhanger leaves House shot by a disgruntled patient.Season 2 also includes a number of extras, including bloopers and interviews, which are sure to please any fan.",5,Crankiness you can't help but love,1182988800,"06 28, 2007",2007,2163,"['Even', 'who', 'hate', 'Dr.', 'Gregory', 'House', 'are', 'forced', 'admit', 'man', 'brilliant', 'Relying', 'unconventional', 'methods', 'three', 'fellows', 'tutelage', 'House', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'regularly', 'cracks', 'difficult', 'cases', 'other', 'doctors', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'long', 'ago.Ironically', 'enough', 'one', 'patient', 'House', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'Seven', 'years', 'ago', 'suffered', 'infarction', 'thigh', 'undergoing', 'dangerous', 'surgery', 'attempt', 'save', 'life', 'House', 'did', 'survive', 'was', 'left', 'constant', 'pain', 'causing', 'pop', 'Vicodin', 'candy', 'walk', 'serious', 'limp', 'become', 'filled', 'even', 'more', 'bitterness', 'began', 'with.It', 'was', 'largely', 'House', 'broke', 'up', 'longtime', 'live-in', 'girlfriend', 'attorney', 'Stacy', 'Warner', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'time', 'married', 'someone', 'else', 'moved', 'House', 'too', 'behavior', 'otherwise.Added', 'House', 'antisocial', 'always', 'thinks', 'box', 'one', 'fellows', 'once', 'said', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'where', 'box', 'Introspective', 'much', 'too', 'frank', 'House', 'loner', 'friendship', 'Dr.', 'James', 'Wilson', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'young', 'oncologist', 'who', 'also', 'Princeton-Plainsboro', 'Teaching', 'Hospital', 'boss', 'dean', 'medicine', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'Cuddy', 'Lisa', 'Edelstein', '.Despite', 'verbal', 'abuse', 'eccentricity', 'House', 'three', 'fellows', 'Drs', 'Robert', 'Chase', 'Jesse', 'Spencer', 'Eric', 'Foreman', 'Omar', 'Epps', 'Allison', 'Cameron', 'Jennifer', 'Morrison', 'know', 'one', 'best', 'working', 'few', 'years', 'will', 'guarantee', 'choice', 'jobs', ""'re"", 'ready', 'work', 'unsupervised.Season', '2', 'many', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'House', 'ex', 'Stacy', 'who', 'hired', 'hospital', 'attorney', 'causing', 'much', 'friction', 'longing', 'two', 'more', 'Foreman', 'Chase', 'Cameron', 'backgrounds', 'as', 'well', 'flashbacks', 'House', 'infarction', 'Foreman', 'deadly', 'disease', 'Patient', 'Week', 'season', 'cliffhanger', 'House', 'shot', 'disgruntled', 'patient.Season', '2', 'also', 'number', 'extras', 'including', 'bloopers', 'interviews', 'are', 'sure', 'please', 'fan']",House: Season Two
996746,A2MZ1VBYTQ7MO5,B000FVQLIO,Joseph Haggard Jr.,"[8, 12]","The first season of ""House, M.D."" introduced us to a sardonic, pill-popping (though brilliant) doctor named Gregory House, who (along with his medical team) in each episode would take on baffling cases and tried to solve the mysterious illnesses that their patients would come down with. The medical mysteries continue with season two of ""House, M.D."", which I think is just as superb as season one. Many of the great qualities that were displayed in the first season are back in the second season: excellent writing, exceptional directing, and terrific acting by the cast.Hugh Laurie returns in his career defining role as Dr. House, an individual who's very good at his job but not very good at being nice to anyone (including his team). Laurie is the whole show here, but he has the great support of an extremely talented supporting cast. Lisa Edelstein (Dr. Cuddy), Omar Epps (Dr. Foreman), Robert Sean Leonard (Dr. Wilson), Jennifer Morrison (Dr. Cameron), and Jesse Spencer (Dr. Chase) are all back as well, with at least one welcome addition to the cast for part of season two. Two time Emmy award winning actress Sela Ward (""Sisters"", ""Once and Again"") was introduced at the end of season one as House's ex-girlfriend Stacy Warner, who asked House to treat her husband who came down with a mysterious illness (which he eventually cured). In the final episode of season one, Dr. Cuddy wanted to hire Stacy to become the hospital lawyer, though first asking House for his permission. He agreed and in season two we get to see much of Stacy as House tries to not only deal with his patients and his incredibly sore leg, but also deal with his relationship with Stacy in spite of the fact that she's currently married. This was a terrific storyline to the show as well as intriguing, as you wonder what's going to happen between these two people. There's great chemistry between Laurie and Ward in their scenes together and the two play off each other wonderfully.Even though Hugh Laurie is the main star of ""House, M.D."", the supporting actors got a chance to show off their acting chops in season two. Omar Epps gives a powerful performance in the two part episode titled Euphoria, in which Dr. Foreman comes down with an illness that House and his other team members frantically try to find a cure for. Jesse Spencer shines in the episode The Mistake, in which Dr. Chase comes under fire from the hospital board after making a fatal error that leads to the death of a patient. Sela Ward also does some strong acting in this same episode as Stacy tries to help Chase in telling him on what he should say at the disciplinary hearing. And Jennifer Morrison does a good job in the episode Hunting, where Dr. Cameron fears that she might have contracted AIDS after an AIDS patient that she treats accidentally coughs blood over her.Though ""House, M.D."" is a drama series, the show has its share of funny moments as the humor level went up a few notches in season two. Most of the laughs come from the insanely things that House says to everyone, but that's not all. Some of the truly funniest moments include: House allowing Wilson to come live with him and their living arrangements start to backfire almost from the start; House, Wilson, and Cuddy enjoying a night of gambling at their hospital benefit; House catching a mouse at Stacy's place, then decides to keep it by bringing it to the hospital; and the laugh out loud moment of season two is when House breaks the news to a Chinese woman who only speaks Mandarin that her teenage daughter is pregnant. (Yes, he breaks the news to her speaking in Mandarin!)While there are plenty of laughs on ""House, M.D."", there are also plenty of disturbing images that might be too intense for some viewers. This is especially true of the last episode of season two: No Reason. Even though the primary storyline of this episode revolves around House getting shot by the husband of a former patient and realizing that the pain in his leg is starting to go away, there's the secondary storyline that revolves around a patient with a very bad tongue infection. I must warn you, what this patient goes through is extremely tough to watch. If you haven't seen this episode yet and you're reading this now, please take my warning seriously. There are a couple of extremely graphic moments that may be too much for some people. By the end of this episode I was in shock at what I had seen. During the first two seasons, ""House, M.D."" has had its share of graphically disturbing moments. But the No Reason episode is by far the most hard to watch episode to date.In spite of all the disturbing elements that this show puts on display, ""House, M.D."" is a terrific show. For season two, it received its first Emmy nomination as Best Drama Series. But where was Hugh Laurie's nomination for Best Actor? Everybody said that he was snubbed, and boy they were right. But I'm sure he'll be back nominated next year. On the bright side, he won a Golden Globe earlier this year for season two, which was well deserved. And if the show continues to get stronger with each season, I think some of the supporting cast members will be honored too as well as possible nods for its writing and directing which it so much deserves.""House, M.D."" is the medical show to watch! Season three has just started and I'm dying to see what's in store for Dr. House and company this year.",5,"House, M.D. - Season Two",1158278400,"09 15, 2006",2006,5400,"['first', 'season', 'House',

996747,ARLKYF9JL3QKB,B000FVQLIO,J. SHARP,"[6, 9]","appointment television:1. a program that someone schedules time to view every week2. HouseThis has become the only show I must watch each week and viewing the second season episodes end-to-end reminds me why. It's just plain fun to watch. From the hilarious Hugh Laurie to the addictive heartbeat of its theme song, it is both surprising and repetitive all at once. If you ever think they've solved the puzzle in the first 30 minutes, you haven't seen any other episodes.The writing can be maddeningly frustrating while delivering huge entertainment. The character development of the whitecoat trio (Foreman, Cameron, and Chase) is often ""don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-it"" brief but they are still well-differentiated and engagingly acted. An out-of-the-blue personal crisis for Cuddy seems arbitrary but makes for great banter between Lisa Edelstein and Laurie. And the will-they-won't-they drama between the scruffy, drug-addled House and the blindingly gorgeous, immaculate ex (Sela Ward) who saved his life by crippling him seems anomalous with its surroundings and unlikely on its face but gives us a peek into House's heart of hearts.Improvements on Season 1's set include single-sided discs, true widescreen transfer instead of terrible letterboxing, the addition of more bonus features (especially Edelstein's and Jennifer Morrison's ""Valley Girl"" versions of selected scenes - I hope this becomes a tradition), and the spreading of those bonuses among the discs rather than lumping them all in one place. One nit: The discs are stacked in groups of two, so those with three hands are at an advantage when trying to pull an even-numbered disc out of the fold-out packaging.My candidate for gag of the year is from the strawberry jelly scene:House: Okay, I'm gonna give you some antibiotics.

House was gripping, entertaining, and a complete jerk. I loved him. Season 2 takes this show to an entirely new level though. House is established within the first few episodes for those who have not seen the initial season. After this, the series begins to build more characters that are dynamic. As if House was not enough, they now develop the personality of his team of doctors. Chase, Foreman, and Carmen all go through character cycles that build on you.House is a painkiller-addicted doctor who walks with a limp due to a muscle being removed in his leg. He is the best doctor in the hospital, but is often apathetic and hates patients. The storyline of a common episode will depict House and his team trying to find out what is wrong with an abnormal patient. They will come up with a solution and find out it is wrong. Then they continue to find solutions until they find the right one. Along the way, there is plenty of gore and snide remarks on behalf of House. Almost every episode has this underlying pattern.The episodes often break off into side plots, which actually become the main plot. This creates multiple captivating plots. Character development branches off these side plots. At the end of the Season, you feel like you know each character. You do not just know there character, but you know their ideals and personality given any situation.Foreman changes his character drastically about four times. Each time is progressive and makes perfect sense though. Not only does is dialogue change, but his appearance changes. Foreman came off as my favorite character in Season 2. I am not one for being a crybaby, but Foreman gave a heart-wrenching performance in a few episodes.This Season of House M.D. is better than theoriginal. I advise picking up both though. Each episode is great in its own way. The Season finale will have you so far on the edge of your seat that you will be on the floor.

House's personality has always stretched believability, because no hospital could have a doctor like that on the staff, but it's a show, so we accepted it, telling ourselves that he's just blunt and doesn't suffer fools gladly. Apparently the writers decided that if we could accept that we were game to accept a good deal worse from not only House, but from his team as well, and the whole thing just seemed to devolve deep into soap opera land in the second season.*** SPOILERS ***- Not only is House his usual angry, rude, arrogant, mean self, but this season he throws himself at his old girlfriend (who is married) until she sleeps with him, and just as she's about to leave her husband House tells her to go back to him. As part of his attack plan House breaks into her therapist's office and reads her file so he'll know the weak points in her marriage. Gee, how much lower can you stoop?- In one episode House appears to decide that he needs the distraction offered by a prostitute.- When Dr. Wilson leaves his wife, he moves in with House, who is a total jerk to his only friend. He uses him, lies to him, sabotages his attempts to get an apartment, embarrasses him in front of others, and generally thinks its great fun to be cruel to someone who just found out his wife is having an affair.- Cameron is apparently intrigued by a gay recreational drug user who claims that drugs and having AIDS has somehow made him really happy, so she tries some of his drugs she finds in his backback. Cameron, all whacked out on drugs invites Chase over and seduces him. The next day she's clearly still under the influence of whatever she took and it hardly generates a shrug from House or anyone else. But then, why would anyone care if a doctor is hyped up on recreational drugs?- Cameron and Foreman bicker over some article he submitted and had published based on Cameron's writeup of a case. This goes on for several shows, both during consultations with House and in front of patients. Foreman was a jerk and Cameron handled it like a child. Grow up, people.- Cutty apparently decides she wants to have a baby. It's like they imported writers from General Hospital for this season.- Chase fails to properly diagnose a patient because he'd just found out his dad died, but for some incomprehensible reason decides to apologize to the patient's husband for being too hung over to treat her properly. Apparently he really wanted to get himself and the hospital sued (and it worked).- House shoots a corpse in the morgue to see if the MRI machine will pull bullet fragments out of a person. Apparently it will (at least in this fantasy show), but it puts the MRI machine out of commission for two weeks while it gets fixed. ""My bad,"" says House. Indeed.- The final episode is a cliffhanger, and it turns out that almost the entire show is just House having an hallucination/dream. There is little I find less interesting than a story that isn't even real to a ficticious character.All of this, combined with a few other issues convinced me that they just didn't have good writers this season. The show has a great premise and an excellent cast, but the writing was weak this season in my opinion, because instead of writing solid, interesting stories, they resorted to cheap soap opera plot devices. Character development is good, but the cases need to be interesting as well, and character destruction is not the same as character development.As for the cases, well, you'd think lumbar punctures, MRIs, and biopsies are the only diagnostic tools they have, and virtually any combination of symptoms can be explained by one of about a half-dozen conditions that get mentioned in almost every show (and never turn out to be the problem). In general there's less focus on cases and more on the interpersonal turmoil than there was in season one, and I thought thought the show suffered for it.House's clinic patients offered some comic relief in season one, and we still see some in season two, but not as many, and I missed them. We also see less of House watching soap operas. I guess since the show had become one there was less reason for him to watch them.And finally, for reasons I can't explain, in a few shows this season I never quite understood what was wrong with the main patient. I never had that problem in season one, but somehow the part where we find out what the problem was seemed rushed at times in this season, to the point I missed it altogether in a few episodes.In sum, I found season two to be a step down from season one in pretty much every respect. Most successful shows don't try to change things until the show has had a few years to get stale.",2,Disappointing after season one,1184457600,"07 15, 2007",2007,4785,"['know', ""'m"", 'swimming', 'tide', 'here', 'given', 'other', 'reviews', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'season', 'House', 'personality', 'always', 'stretched', 'believability', 'hospital', 'could', 'have', 'doctor', 'staff', 'show', 'accepted', 'telling', 'ourselves', 'just', 'blunt', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'fools', 'gladly', 'Apparently', 'writers', 'decided', 'could', 'accept', 'were', 'game', 'accept', 'good', 'deal', 'worse', 'not', 'only', 'House', 'team', 'as', 'well', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'seemed', 'devolve', 'deep', 'soap', 'opera', 'land', 'second', 'season', '***', 'SPOILERS', '***-', 'Not', 'only', 'House', 'usual', 'angry', 'rude', 'arrogant', 'mean', 'self', 'season', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'married', 'just', 'leave', 'husband', 'House', 'go', 'back', 'part', 'attack', 'plan', 'House', 'therapist', 'office', 'file', ""'ll"", 'know', 'weak', 'points', 'marriage', 'Gee', 'how', 'much', 'lower', 'can', 'stoop', 'one', 'episode', 'House', 'decide', 'distraction', 'offered', 'prostitute.-', 'When', 'Dr.', 'Wilson', 'wife', 'House', 'who', 'total', 'jerk', 'only', 'friend', 'attempts', 'get', 'apartment', 'front', 'others', 'generally', 'great', 'fun', 'be', 'cruel', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'wife', 'having', 'affair.-', 'Cameron', 'apparently', 'intrigued', 'gay', 'recreational', 'drug', 'user', 'who', 'drugs', 'having', 'AIDS', 'somehow', 'made', 'really', 'happy', 'drugs', 'backback', 'Cameron', 'whacked', 'out', 'drugs', 'invites', 'Chase', 'seduces', 'next', 'day', 'clearly', 'still', 'influence', 'took', 'hardly', 'shrug', 'House', 'anyone', 'else', 'then', 'why', 'would', 'anyone', 'care', 'doctor', 'hyped', 'up', 'recreational', 'drugs', 'Cameron', 'Foreman', 'bicker', 'article', 'submitted', 'had', 'published', 'based', 'Cameron', 'writeup', 'case', 'several', 'shows', 'consultations', 'House', 'front', 'patients', 'Foreman', 'was', 'jerk', 'Cameron', 'handled', 'child', 'Grow', 'up', 'people.-', 'Cutty', 'apparently', 'have', 'baby', 'imported', 'writers', 'General', 'Hospital', 'season.-', 'Chase', 'properly', 'diagnose', 'patient', ""'d"", 'just', 'found', 'out', 'dad', 'died', 'incomprehensible', 'reason', 'decides', 'apologize', 'patient', 'husband', 'being', 'too', 'hung', 'treat', 'properly', 'Apparently', 'really', 'wanted', 'get', 'hospital', 'sued', 'worked', '.-', 'House', 'shoots', 'corpse', 'morgue', 'see', 'MRI', 'machine', 'will', 'pull', 'bullet', 'fragments', 'person', 'Apparently', 'will', 'least', 'fantasy', 'show', 'MRI', 'machine', 'commission', 'two', 'weeks', 'fixed', 'bad', 'House', 'Indeed.-', 'final', 'episode', 'cliffhanger', 'out', 'almost', 'entire', 'show', 'just', 'House', 'having', 'hallucination/dream', 'little', 'find', 'less', 'interesting', 'story', ""n't"", 'even', 'real', 'ficticious', 'character.All', 'combined', 'few', 'other', 'issues', 'convinced', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'writers', 'season', 'show', 'great', 'premise', 'excellent', 'cast', 'writing', 'was', 'weak', 'season', 'opinion', 'instead', 'writing', 'solid', 'interesting', 'stories', 'resorted', 'cheap', 'soap', 'opera', 'plot', 'devices', 'Character', 'development', 'good', 'cases', 'need', 'be', 'interesting', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'destruction', 'not', 'same', 'character', 'development.As', 'cases', 'well', ""'d"", 'think', 'lumbar', 'punctures', 'MRIs', 'biopsies', 'are', 'only', 'diagnostic', 'tools', 'have', 'virtually', 'combination', 'symptoms', 'can', 'be', 'explained', 'one', 'half-dozen', 'conditions', 'get', 'mentioned', 'almost', 'show', 'never', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'problem', 'general', 'less', 'focus', 'cases', 'more', 'interpersonal', 'turmoil', 'was', 'season', 'one', 'thought', 'thought', 'show', 'suffered', 'it.House', 'clinic', 'patients', 'offered', 'comic', 'relief', 'season', 'one', 'still', 'see', 'season', 'two', 'not', 'many', 'missed', 'also', 'see', 'less', 'House', 'watching', 'soap', 'operas', 'guess', 'show', 'had', 'become', 'one', 'was', 'less', 'reason', 'watch', 'them.And', 'finally', 'reasons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'few', 'shows', 'season', 'never', 'quite', 'understood', 'what', 'was', 'wrong', 'main', 'patient', 'never', 'had', 'problem', 'season', 'one', 'somehow', 'part', 'where', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'problem', 'was', 'seemed', 'rushed', 'times', 'season', 'point', 'missed', 'altogether', 'few', 'episodes.In', 'sum', 'found', 'season', 'two', 'be', 'step', 'down', 'season', 'one', 'pretty', 'much', 'respect', 'Most', 'successful', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'change', 'things', 'show', 'had', 'few', 'years', 'get', 'stale']",House: Season Two

While other hospital dramas often have sappy-sweet doctors and soap-opera interrelationships, House is amazing because of its smart, strong characters and the interactions between them. You rarely have the ""stupid administrator"" who gets in the way of everything going on for inane reasons. It usually is smart person 1 with good reasons, talking with smart person 2 with equally good reasons, trying to sort out what the best solution is. The game doesn't play down to its audience - it expects its audience to pay attention and to catch all the small details.That's why these stories are so great to re-watch multiple times, and to see in order. You see the characters growing, subtly, and relating previous experiences to current situations. These aren't the silly person-goes-from-sour-to-super-happy sitcom style changes. They are realistic, quiet, small changes, like most real humans go through. You get the sense that these characters are organic, that they learn and grow and mature.The dialogue is just great. I could quote hundreds of lines from House that I love, and every time I rewatch the show, they still have that power. It's the interaction of bright, well educated minds, with numerous sly allusions to Moby Dick, Shakespeare, and much more.Like with most series, it's really great to go into this without knowing ANY of the plotlines so you can experience them fresh. At least, unlike Season 1, the DVD doesn't give plots away! That's really great. It means if you haven't seen Season 2 yet, you can use the DVD without fear of getting hints before you start each episode. Be very careful when reading other reviews, a lot of them give away key plot points. I think it's fair enough to say that episodes feature patients in danger of losing their lives, and that a few of the cast members end up at risk too.Highly recommended, whether you've never seen this season before or whether you saw it on TV and want to re-watch the episodes. Just make sure you've seen Season 1 first, so you get all the background and basis that leads up to what is happening here.",5,"Fantastically written, acted, plotted",1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,2149,"[""'re"", 'Season', '2', 'then', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'House', 'shine', 'other', 'hospital', 'dramas', 'often', 'have', 'sappy-sweet', 'doctors', 'soap-opera', 'interrelationships', 'House', 'amazing', 'smart', 'strong', 'characters', 'interactions', 'rarely', 'have', 'stupid', 'administrator', 'who', 'way', 'everything', 'going', 'inane', 'reasons', 'usually', 'smart', 'person', '1', 'good', 'reasons', 'talking', 'smart', 'person', '2', 'equally', 'good', 'reasons', 'trying', 'sort', 'out', 'what', 'best', 'solution', 'game', ""n't"", 'play', 'down', 'audience', 'audience', 'pay', 'attention', 'catch', 'small', 'details.That', 'why', 'stories', 'are', 'so', 'great', 're-watch', 'multiple', 'times', 'see', 'order', 'see', 'characters', 'growing', 'subtly', 'relating', 'previous', 'experiences', 'current', 'situations', 'are', ""n't"", 'silly', 'person-goes-from-sour-to-super-happy', 'sitcom', 'style', 'changes', 'are', 'realistic', 'quiet', 'small', 'changes', 'most', 'real', 'humans', 'go', 'get', 'sense', 'characters', 'are', 'organic', 'learn', 'grow', 'mature.The', 'dialogue', 'just', 'great', 'could', 'quote', 'hundreds', 'lines', 'House', 'love', 'time', 'rewatch', 'show', 'still', 'have', 'power', 'interaction', 'bright', 'well', 'educated', 'minds', 'numerous', 'sly', 'allusions', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'Shakespeare', 'much', 'most', 'series', 'really', 'great', 'go', 'knowing', 'ANY', 'plotlines', 'can', 'experience', 'fresh', 'least', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'give', 'plots', 'away', 'really', 'great', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Season', '2', 'yet', 'can', 'use', 'DVD', 'fear', 'getting', 'hints', 'start', 'episode', 'Be', 'very', 'careful', 'when', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'lot', 'give', 'away', 'key', 'plot', 'points', 'think', 'fair', 'enough', 'say', 'episodes', 'feature', 'patients', 'danger', 'losing', 'lives', 'few', 'cast', 'members', 'end', 'up', 'risk', 'too.Highly', 'recommended', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'season', 'saw', 'TV', 'want', 're-watch', 'episodes', 'Just', 'make', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Season', '1', 'first', 'get', 'background', 'basis', 'up', 'what', 'happening', 'here']",House: Season Two

All I care about is the incredible dynamics created between the central players. As for the dialogue? Man, the dialogue is beyond equal on TV today. House has throwaway lines that other shows would kill for, but there are just so many, I'm sure most viewers simply don't realise how clever it is. It really is one of the funniest shows on TV, even though it's not a comedy.If you like watching specialists solving mysteries, you must see this. If you want an idea of what it's like, try thinking of Columbo meets Qunicy meets CSI - though House surpasses all of them.Hugh Laurie and the script writers have done such an incredible job bringing House to life.

996777,A2VODABWSVHV8E,B000FVQLIO,"Ray ""A Reader""","[1, 2]","What can be said about a series that must certainly be ranked as one of the most compelling to have ever appeared on television? It is easy to view the slew of awards that ""House, M.D."" has been nominated for (and won), to recall the litany of accolades the show has garnered from news, entertainment, and magazine critics, and even to review the endless series of online postings concerning the show (like this very one, here, on Amazon), and conclude that, ""Yes, ""House, M.D."" is probably a good show."" But in fact, ""House, M.D."" is more than a good show. For many viewers, the series is easily one of the most fascinating and unusual to have ever been aired on television. Moreover, and dare I say it, the series will likely eventually be ranked amongst the top television shows ever produced on network television.But before I say any more about ""House, M.D.,"" let me briefly for the reader summarize the show. ""House, M.D."" is a medical drama that takes place at a fictional teaching hospital (""Princeton-Plainsborough Hospital""). The story revolves around a particular doctor, Dr. Gregory House, an individual who has established himself as a medical genius able to solve difficult medical mysteries that other doctors have been unable to solve. Dr. House works with a small group of internists who are serving in residence under him, and who, despite their much less experience, actively work with House to solve medical problems through a technique called a ""Differential Diagnosis,"" a kind of group-based brainstorming session where diagnostic ideas are presented, written on a white board, and systematically eliminated by comparing each hypothesis with the ongoing list of patient symptoms. But Dr. House is more than just a diagnostic genius: he possesses a debilitating leg injury that keeps him in perpetual pain, and he regularly uses powerful prescription painkillers to the point where there is genuine concern that he may, in fact, be a pain medicine addict. But there's more. Along with his genius, House has an incredibly insensitive and offensive demeanor, and seemingly has no concern for social norms, courtesies, or sometimes, even common decency. His unparalleled genius at helping patients is probably what keeps him employed in spite of his incredibly ongoing offensive behavior.What makes this show so compelling, so unique, and so interesting? There is probably no one answer to this question. At the core of it is likely House himself, a character who is fundamentally a contradiction, a walking incongruity, a person that we desperately and increasingly wish to understand, and perhaps, even wish to control to correct his unacceptable behavior. We find ourselves watching this man and so strongly wishing that we can figure him out, to come to a true understanding and belief about him, to solve the mystery of who he really is, and by that knowledge, settle the manifold open questions surrounding him and his relationships to others that each episode more fully presents.Unfortunately, or should I rather say, ""fortunately,"" such an understanding is not easily developed. The complexities, ambiguities, and open questions surrounding the character of House come tantalizingly close to being solved time after time, only to be later shown that what we thought was the answer to this man was really just another false lead, another misunderstanding, another fact to add into this increasingly difficult puzzle. Part of the show's allure is this ongoing dissonance, not only between House and his coworkers, but deeply within House himself. Is he truly an uncaring person? Is he truly a person who views his entire medical career as simply a series of puzzles to be solved, and where people who recover are simply a side effect of the solved puzzle? Does he really look at every social, religious, or ethnic factor as a legitimate target of derision? Is he truly hostile to people's religious convictions? Does he truly believe that his drug addiction is an irrelevant issue to his work? Each episode faces us with House's reaction to these questions to varying degrees, and over time, we may find that we build an increasing understanding of this man, but we often find those understandings torn apart in a later episode, where new observations on House make us rethink what we think we knew.In spite of House's problems and deficiencies, we often find him an imminently likeable character, and we often see hints of goodness in him that he desperately tries to keep hidden from others. Often, it is hinted in the subtilest of ways that House himself wishes to hide from others the fact that he truly does care, but this hint is just as quickly dashed as we witness his next immature toy kicking. (It can sometimes seem that House is more of a four year old in a nursery who is testing his fellow nursery members for territorial markers. In other cases, he is the genius child who seeks to use others as fodder for his most recent theories on human and animal behavior.)""House, M.D.,"" if the truth be known, does not start out in Season One as a soap opera, but by Season Five for the series run, I think a defensible case can be made that the show takes on many of the trappings of a soap opera, curiously and ironically enough, mirroring the very soap operas that the character House in the show is seen so frequently watching (often, on an old, 1990's style portable television located in his office). This morphing into the arena of the soap opera doesn't really matter, though, for the viewer who has gone through the entire set of previous episodes in order. With no attempt to defend this shift in style, the show uses its first three seasons to genuinely establish itself as a puzzle solving, medical mystery show, with House serving as a medical Sherlock Holmes (sans the hat and the pipe, but plus the strange personality and temperament issues), and the stories are easily carried with each individual episode standing as a mental gymnastic exercise that keeps the viewer wanting more. But strewn through these episodes are myriads of strange, and often, very awkward character interactions that are left unfinished and unexplored, tantalizing us with seeming keys to unlock the mystery of House. It is perhaps inevitable that a show lasting so many years (now in its sixth season) and having such strong characters and unusual trappings would be inevitably drawn to revisit and examine such unfinished business. These ""explorations"" begin to occur more repeatedly in Season Four, and by Season Five, we see the exaggeration of much of this at the expense of series' original, focal point of medical mysteries to be resolved, which by this point in the series often take back seat to the ever growing personal dramas. But even this doesn't matter. The issues and themes explored in Season Five, while taking on the feeling of a soap opera, are still handled with great expertise and generally fascinating ways, so that we still find ourselves focused on each event, all the time still (unconsciously at times, I must admit) wishing that we can figure House out, get the mystery of House solved, and have some type of a resolution that fits our conception of the real world. By the end of Season Five, we still do not have an answer for this dilemma, and the show uses this dilemma to hold the audience's attention in a powerful manner.The basic premise of the show is so startling unique and fascinating in its own right that the show does not need to rely on cheap ""shock"" tricks to maintain attention. It is true that there are a number of ""shocking"" events to occur through the series, and there can be no doubt that the show, being first and foremost a network based television format production, employs ""cliffhangers"" to hold the viewer through the regular commercial breaks, but it is amazing to see how the show is regularly worked into individual episodes that are artfully crafted into stories that flow, and work, from beginning to end.Quite some time ago, I wrote a long review for ""The Rockford Files,"" a television show in the 1970's that, in my own thinking, achieved the status as being one of the best television shows ever produced. I had written my review at a time when the first ""Rockford Files"" DVD's were being released, and the opportunity to re-watch these shows reminded me again of the superior writing, the acting, and the impressive interworking of the cast which made this show, not just a cut above the average television show, but a true classic, one that could almost not be challenged in the realm of television. I still feel that way about The Rockford Files, and, truth be known, another very different show from a decade earlier, ""The Dick Van Dyke Show,"" had many of these same characteristics, all coalescing to make what eventual became in both cases a classic production. ""The Rockford Files"" and ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" reached such pinnacles of performance that they remain examples of the very best television ever made, and even the ravages of 30 and 40 years of time have done little but solidify that achievement.""House, M.D."" is, in my opinion, is likely destined for that same level of accolade. In the show, we find that same coalescing of features - a truly unique character creation, excellent writing, and a cast that works well together - that will argue for the show's inclusion in that highest level of ranking. But whether that specific claim turns out to be true or not, the fact remains that House, M.D. is one of the most fascinating, intriguing, and enjoyable shows to watch. We witness medical problems and the difficult procedure in diagnosing and treating those problems; we witness the struggles, oddities, and offensiveness (and yes, there are many parts of the show that are incredibly offensive) of a main character who remains both a genius and an enigma, an inscrutable person who is endlessly fascinating to behold; we witness a cast of actors who must earn to interact with the powerful character of House while establishing their own credibility; and finally, but not least of all, we enjoy Hugh Laurie's incredible rendition of the House character. Add these factors up, and you end up with one heck of a fascinating show. I'll say it in conclusion again, that this is one of the best television shows to have appeared in years, and Hugh Laurie is superb in his role as House. You can enjoy it even more on DVD, where there are no commercial interruptions. I rate this as five stars, but the real truth is that it is one BIG star (House) with four other stars with him. Well, make that seven or eight other stars, depending on the season you are currently watching.",5,Is There a Doctor in the House?

996778,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000FVQLIO,Robert I. Hedges,"[2, 2]","""House"" is a perfect television show, and is, in my opinion, the only dramatic show currently in production that's worth watching. The show, centered on the acerbic, thoroughly disagreeable, and utterly brilliant Dr. Gregory House, is well written, intelligently directed, and perfectly acted. Hugh Laurie as House deservedly gets the lion's share of the plaudits for the show, but the remaining cast is equally brilliant in their vital supporting roles. Omar Epps, Jennifer Morrison, and Jesse Spencer deserve special mention for playing the young and impressionable doctors putting up with House's eccentricities, but my favorite of the supporting cast is Robert Sean Leonard as oncologist Dr. James Wilson. Leonard's portrayal is both funny and poignant, as are the lines crafted for him by the excellent screenwriters.There are several plotlines in this season, most significantly the reappearance of ex-girlfriend Stacy, played by Sela Ward, in House's life.
