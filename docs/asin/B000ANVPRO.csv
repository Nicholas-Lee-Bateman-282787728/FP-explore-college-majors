There were maybe 3 really funny comedians out of 18 I think. Some parts were down right boring. However I will say when it was funny it was FUNNY. I would say Netflix this if possible.,2,Some good mostly bad,1226102400,"11 8, 2008",2008,265,"['expected', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'something', 'P-Diddy', 'would', 'sign', 'name', 'were', 'maybe', '3', 'really', 'funny', 'comedians', '18', 'think', 'parts', 'were', 'down', 'right', 'boring', 'However', 'will', 'say', 'when', 'was', 'funny', 'was', 'FUNNY', 'would', 'say', 'Netflix', 'possible']",N/A

I'm Kind Of A ...","[0, 0]","I really thought that Diddy's attempt at a stand up comedy show would fall to its knees but I thought wrong. One thing that Sean Combs does well is picking out good talent. Some of the talent he picks doesn't make it for example the 1000 or so bands he's tried to complete but he and his team were pretty much dead on. Best of all these guys are comics on the come up and they're hungry to make the crowd laugh though some of them I've seen on Comic View. Even better the comics seen in other shows like Comic View use different material and if by chance they use something you've heard before they spice it up a little bit. Diddy doesn't discriminate though there isn't that many female comics, he uses comedians with all types of backgrounds but it doesn't matter as long as they're funny. I love that Doug E. Fresh is the host because he does it properly. One thing I hate is that every comic is wearing Sean John but the comics crack some jokes about that mostly because they don't care if they wear it because it's free. I gave Bad Boys Of Comedy 4 stars because there are a couple comics that weren't cutting it but not enough people to keep you from enjoying the show. Overall this is a hilarious series it's hard to give examples of the jokes cause the ones I remember most cant be said.",4,"Bad Boys, Good Comedy",1159920000,"10 4, 2006",2006,1295,"['really', 'thought', 'Diddy', 'attempt', 'stand', 'up', 'comedy', 'show', 'would', 'fall', 'knees', 'thought', 'wrong', 'One', 'thing', 'Sean', 'Combs', 'well', 'picking', 'out', 'good', 'talent', 'talent', ""n't"", 'make', 'example', '1000', 'so', 'tried', 'complete', 'team', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'dead', 'Best', 'guys', 'are', 'comics', 'come', 'up', ""'re"", 'hungry', 'make', 'crowd', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Comic', 'View', 'Even', 'better', 'comics', 'seen', 'other', 'shows', 'Comic', 'View', 'use', 'different', 'material', 'chance', 'use', 'something', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'spice', 'up', 'little', 'bit', 'Diddy', ""n't"", 'discriminate', ""n't"", 'that', 'many', 'female', 'comics', 'comedians', 'types', 'backgrounds', ""n't"", 'matter', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'funny', 'love', 'Doug', 'E.', 'Fresh', 'host', 'properly', 'One', 'thing', 'hate', 'comic', 'wearing', 'Sean', 'John', 'comics', 'crack', 'jokes', 'mostly', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'wear', 'free', 'gave', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'Comedy', '4', 'stars', 'are', 'couple', 'comics', 'were', ""n't"", 'cutting', 'not', 'enough', 'people', 'keep', 'enjoying', 'show', 'Overall', 'hilarious', 'series', 'hard', 'give', 'examples', 'jokes', 'cause', 'ones', 'remember', 'most', 'cant', 'be', 'said']",N/A

929092,A2I1LQUJ819P26,B000ANVPRO,Poetic,"[1, 2]","Yeah, it was funny. You have over 30 comedians stand before a LIVE audience and deliever their material. First of all, I am a big fan of stand up comedy so I bought this DVD without hesitation. There are a few comedians featured on here who you never heard of or seen before. Some of them, you probably have seen them on Comic View.I must admit, all the comedians on here wasn't all that funny. At the same time, none of the comedians WASN'T downright terrible. Every comedian at least made me smile or chuckle and some others made me LAUGH OUT LOUD!I was going to give it 3 stars but 3 stars is Average and it's just a tad bit above average but it wasn't worth 5 stars, maybe next season.So, if you're in the mood to laugh, go ahead and check this out or rent it from your local Blockbuster or somewhere. It has some behind the scenes footage too, which was interesting but I'm waiting to see how Season 2 will turn out.P.S. All the comedians brought energy to the stage so it really doesn't get dull, just some of the comedian's jokes didn't go over too well with the view audience.P.S. There is one guy on here named Reggie Reg who does a Denzel Washington impression and he sounds just like the real Denzel. He has the voice and mannerisms to the t.
