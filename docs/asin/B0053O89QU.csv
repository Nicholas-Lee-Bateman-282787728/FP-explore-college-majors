Well, The Middle isn't among them ;) But while critics have given the show a lukewarm reception, all of the actual TV viewers I know have been immediately charmed and delighted by this underrated gem of a show.The Middle doesn't go out of its way to flaunt just how edgy and risque it can be. It doesn't, like so many other critically lauded shows, feature wholly unlikable people doing wholly unlikable things while half-winking at the camera over just how zany they are. It doesn't go for cartoonishly over-the-top wackiness or the kind of constant lowbrow sexual innuendo and fart jokes that you might unpleasantly associate with high school locker rooms.Instead, The Middle simply tells the story of a family that's likable and even admirable despite also being realistically, hilariously flawed. The humor stems from the strong characterizations, sharp dialogue and the clever insight peppered throughout. (You'll be thinking ""that is so true...it's scary how well I can relate to that!"" at least a few times per episode). We get flashes of heartwarming poignancy here too, but rest assured that it's never too sappy or forced. It's quietly uplifting, but in a way that feels earned rather than manipulatively sentimental.This is one of those rare shows that successfully blends humor with heart, and I was pleasantly surprised to realize just how much I've come to love spending time with this family. I used to have a weird visceral dislike for Patricia Heaton and, for reasons alluded to above, rarely like sitcoms...but this show immediately reversed my opinion of Patricia Heaton's acting abilities, and even gave me a renewed hope for the sitcom genre!One major reason it's worth owning on DVD: The vast majority of the episodes not only hold up with multiple viewings, but actually improve, as you notice subtle moments of awesomeness that you were too busy laughing to pick up on the first time around. So many shows *claim* to have struck that balance between wit and poignancy; to have created lovable yet hilariously flawed characters; to have written dialogue that's sharp and memorable. This is one of the few shows that, in my clearly Middle-loving opinion, has actually succeeded in all those areas and more. It's a show that provides mood-boosting humor, a steady supply of heartwarming charm, and razor sharp insight into what it means to be part of a family. I can't wait to FINALLY get my fangirl hands on the Season 3 DVDs, and look forward to rooting for and laughing with the Hecks for many years to come!",5,"If only they would finally, finally release this season on DVD!",1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,2671,"['know', 'over-hyped', 'supposedly', 'daring', 'comedies', 'critics', 'insist', 'discerning', 'TV', 'fans', 'SHOULD', 'love', 'appreciate', 'Well', 'Middle', ""n't"", 'critics', 'have', 'given', 'show', 'lukewarm', 'reception', 'actual', 'TV', 'viewers', 'know', 'have', 'been', 'immediately', 'charmed', 'delighted', 'underrated', 'gem', 'show.The', 'Middle', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'way', 'flaunt', 'just', 'how', 'edgy', 'risque', 'can', 'be', ""n't"", 'so', 'many', 'other', 'critically', 'lauded', 'shows', 'feature', 'wholly', 'unlikable', 'people', 'doing', 'wholly', 'unlikable', 'things', 'half-winking', 'camera', 'just', 'how', 'zany', 'are', ""n't"", 'go', 'cartoonishly', 'over-the-top', 'wackiness', 'kind', 'constant', 'lowbrow', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'fart', 'jokes', 'might', 'unpleasantly', 'associate', 'high', 'school', 'locker', 'rooms.Instead', 'Middle', 'simply', 'story', 'family', 'likable', 'even', 'admirable', 'also', 'being', 'realistically', 'hilariously', 'flawed', 'humor', 'strong', 'characterizations', 'sharp', 'dialogue', 'clever', 'insight', 'peppered', ""'ll"", 'be', 'thinking', 'so', 'true', 'scary', 'how', 'well', 'can', 'relate', 'least', 'few', 'times', 'episode', 'get', 'flashes', 'heartwarming', 'poignancy', 'here', 'too', 'rest', 'assured', 'never', 'too', 'sappy', 'forced', 'quietly', 'uplifting', 'way', 'feels', 'earned', 'rather', 'manipulatively', 'sentimental.This', 'one', 'rare', 'shows', 'successfully', 'humor', 'heart', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'much', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'spending', 'time', 'family', 'used', 'have', 'weird', 'visceral', 'dislike', 'Patricia', 'Heaton', 'reasons', 'alluded', 'above', 'rarely', 'sitcoms', 'show', 'immediately', 'reversed', 'opinion', 'Patricia', 'Heaton', 'acting', 'abilities', 'even', 'gave', 'renewed', 'hope', 'sitcom', 'genre', 'One', 'major', 'reason', 'worth', 'owning', 'DVD', 'vast', 'majority', 'episodes', 'not', 'only', 'hold', 'up', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'actually', 'improve', 'notice', 'subtle', 'moments', 'awesomeness', 'were', 'too', 'busy', 'laughing', 'pick', 'up', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'So', 'many', 'shows', '*claim*', 'have', 'struck', 'balance', 'wit', 'poignancy', 'have', 'created', 'lovable', 'yet', 'hilariously', 'flawed', 'characters', 'have', 'written', 'dialogue', 'sharp', 'memorable', 'one', 'few', 'shows', 'clearly', 'Middle-loving', 'opinion', 'actually', 'succeeded', 'areas', 'more', 'show', 'mood-boosting', 'humor', 'steady', 'supply', 'heartwarming', 'charm', 'razor', 'sharp', 'insight', 'what', 'be', 'part', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'FINALLY', 'get', 'fangirl', 'hands', 'Season', '3', 'DVDs', 'look', 'forward', 'rooting', 'laughing', 'Hecks', 'many', 'years', 'come']","Middle, The: S3 (DVD)"

Better late than never--I didn't even connect with this show until it was well into its 4th season (great promotion team for the show, whoever you are!  Not. ;-)  The combination of the lead ensemble of actors cast here (love 'em all, but Eden Sher as the endlessly upbeat &#34;Sue Heck&#34; is my favorite), plus the way the show uses so many great comedians of all types from other popular past TV shows (they show up as relatives, teachers, neighbors, car salesmen, dentists, even passerby) really grabs me.  And that's before I even comment on the writing.  Easily some of the best sitcom writing for TV, plus the editing and Patricia Heaton's ongoing voiceovers are a huge part of what makes it unique--and funny.  The show is often compared to &#34;Roseanne&#34; (which I also loved), but it really is one of a kind.  I've never experienced anything quite like it.

This, however, is not a traditional review, which I will update at a later date. Instead, I am wondering why there is not a pre-order listing for this title. Warner Bros., the past two years, has at least let the fans know to expect a release, but this year, not so much. With release dates for other series in their library, like ""The Big Bang Theory,"" ""Mike & Molly,"" and ""Suburgatory,"" it baffles me why this series has heard no good news yet. I am dying to own this next season, which was fantastic, to say the least. I really hope something surfaces soon in terms of a DVD (even Blu-ray would be GREAT) for this series. It is truly underrated and deserves to be on DVD. Fingers crossed that an announcement is forthcoming!UPDATE (6/12/13): The WB has announced that production of the season on DVD has begun, with a release date of October 8, 2013!!! I encourage everyone to immediately pre-order/purchase this new set upon its release date to encourage the release of future seasons!

1438951,A303U1MOXG5R1F,B0053O89QU,Sylviastel,"[43, 45]","I love the series, ""The Middle,"" which has Patricia Heaton (Everybody Loves Raymond) and Neil Flynn (Scrubs) as parents of three precocious children in fictional Orson, Indiana. The show is far better than Modern Family which gets awards.Maybe the show is a little too blue collar or set in the middle of the country but it's still one of the best comedies on television and in recent decades. Patricia Heaton should get more Emmys for her performance as Frances ""Frankie"" Heck and the same accolades for her onscreen partner, Neil Flynn as her husband, Mike Heck.The actors who play the children are perfect. Charlie McDermott is a hoot as the oldest son, Axel, who takes off his shirt and clips his toenails in the chip bag. Eden Sher is wonderful as the always optimistic Sue Heck even in the worst of times. And I can't forget Atticus Shaffer as Brick, the boy who prefers books to anything else.This season was great and I look forward to the fourth. Marsha Mason and Jerry Van Dyke play Frankie's parents. John Cullum returns as Big Mike and Norm McDonald plays Mike's younger brother, Rusty. All in all it's a great show that shouldn't be overlooked and should be released entirely on DVD like the first two seasons.",5,Please release the Third Season!,1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,1223,"['love', 'series', 'Middle', 'Patricia', 'Heaton', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'Neil', 'Flynn', 'Scrubs', 'parents', 'three', 'precocious', 'children', 'fictional', 'Orson', 'Indiana', 'show', 'far', 'better', 'Modern', 'Family', 'awards.Maybe', 'show', 'little', 'too', 'blue', 'collar', 'set', 'middle', 'country', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'television', 'recent', 'decades', 'Patricia', 'Heaton', 'should', 'get', 'more', 'Emmys', 'performance', 'Frances', 'Frankie', 'Heck', 'same', 'accolades', 'onscreen', 'partner', 'Neil', 'Flynn', 'husband', 'Mike', 'Heck.The', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'children', 'are', 'perfect', 'Charlie', 'McDermott', 'hoot', 'oldest', 'son', 'Axel', 'who', 'shirt', 'clips', 'toenails', 'chip', 'bag', 'Eden', 'Sher', 'wonderful', 'always', 'optimistic', 'Sue', 'Heck', 'even', 'worst', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Atticus', 'Shaffer', 'Brick', 'boy', 'who', 'books', 'anything', 'else.This', 'season', 'was', 'great', 'look', 'forward', 'fourth', 'Marsha', 'Mason', 'Jerry', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'play', 'Frankie', 'parents', 'John', 'Cullum', 'returns', 'Big', 'Mike', 'Norm', 'McDonald', 'Mike', 'younger', 'brother', 'Rusty', 'great', 'show', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'overlooked', 'should', 'be', 'released', 'entirely', 'DVD', 'first', 'two', 'seasons']","Middle, The: S3 (DVD)"
