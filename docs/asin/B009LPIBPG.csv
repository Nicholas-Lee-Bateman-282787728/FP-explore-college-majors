I bought this mainly to check out the 3D quality, and I was miserably disappointed.  The 3D on this was NOT done in camera; no 3D camera was used.  It was all done in post and not very well; stereo separation frequently occurs vertically, which should never happen.  The result is like watching the film through warped glasses; the depth is all over the place, and often, the couple seem to be receding behind their background.  Your 3D TV's built in 2D to 3D simulation would probably do a better job.There's a stills gallery, which is just frames taken from the film.  Nothing new or different, and nothing you won't see by pausing the video.Other than that, the video & audio are ok.  The content could have been better and more interesting.  For $12, it's ok.  But if that's what what they're going to do for 3D for the rest of the series, they shouldn't even bother.
