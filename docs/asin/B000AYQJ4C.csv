935508,A16DKW7QURRUZB,B000AYQJ4C,D. Nattrass,"[14, 16]","ALL THE WAY HOME DOCUMENTARYThe documentary half of this DVD set is almost everything I could have wanted in a life story of one of my favorite bands. Plenty of great interviews, in depth informative history on how they became what they are, some great rare footage including home videos and their first ever gig. Perhaps the only thing that dissapointed me was I would have preferred a bit less interuption of the musical material. At one stage they are about to play forgiven not forgotten in an effort to get a record deal only to get cut off 15 seconds in by talking and then a new section. However small beefs aside this DVD gives you plenty of everything and alot of insight into the struggles and hard work the Corrs have put in to make it where they are, and compared to the duration of some documentaries we have been treated quited well.THE CORRS LIVE IN GENEVAPerhaps the most exciting factor of The Corrs ""Live in Geneva"", is that this is the first time I have noticed a 'large' change from one DVD to the next. Though there were differences in the first few concert Dvds, alot of the tracks seemed to be the same thing over again more or less (Don't get me wrong, the same thing they were doing was fantastic). Right from the word go the firts song which for so long has been ""Only when I sleep"" has been changed... in my opinion a change which shouldn't have taken place but a change none the less. Also for the first time the Corrs have enough albums released that there has to be quite a few fan favorite songs left out in order to keep the concert under 3 or 4 hours.A big plus which I have been waiting for, for a long time, is the addition of a couple of guitar solos, and extended instrumentals and songs such as: What Can I do. A positive move by the Corrs.I love the Corrs and Andrea (lead singer) to bits however I wish Andrea would stop yelling non - stop throughout 90% of the instrument breaks, and just tone it down a little, its only when she has the tuin whistle in her mouth you get a great extended and uninterupted intrumental break.Sound: The DTS sound is great, however definantly not perfect when you compare it to other dvd's, and I don't really see any excuse for it, in this day and age a modern concert should be almost perfect. The clarity and mixing is mostly great except the dynamics and energy seems to be lost in parts of some songs with poor mixing. 'Toss the feathers' is as unexciting as I have heard it. Overall definantly good enough sound to get the feel though.Video: The video quality is fine, gives you alot of shots of all the musicians, the only thing a little bit lacking is shots of the crowd, however this didn't worry me at all.Set List:Again with the new albums they don't have enough time to fit in all their great songs, I am glad they still have plenty of the great old stuff whilst including the 'better' of the 'borrowed heaven' album. 'Summer Sunshine' and 'Long night' fit in really well to their sets, a couple less well.Performance: I really enjoyed their performance, as I mentioned it was a change to their previous performances, the extended solos, I thought 'radio' was the best I have ever heard it and they still seem to be having fun after all this time, I guess it is really hard when you are comparing ever performance to 'Lansdowne Road' which I think just cannot be topped. For what it was I thought it was great. I think minus the Accordian in no frontiers would have worked for me.Overall: To some it up when it comes down to it if you are a fan of the Corrs you will love it, if you are new to the COrrs you will love it. It is easy to pick on a few minor flaws but its still great.",5,Fantastic insight into a great band,1143072000,"03 23, 2006",2006,3666,"['WAY', 'HOME', 'DOCUMENTARYThe', 'documentary', 'half', 'DVD', 'set', 'almost', 'everything', 'could', 'have', 'wanted', 'life', 'story', 'one', 'favorite', 'bands', 'Plenty', 'great', 'interviews', 'depth', 'informative', 'history', 'how', 'became', 'what', 'are', 'great', 'rare', 'footage', 'including', 'home', 'videos', 'first', 'ever', 'gig', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'thing', 'dissapointed', 'was', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'bit', 'less', 'interuption', 'musical', 'material', 'one', 'stage', 'are', 'play', 'forgiven', 'not', 'forgotten', 'effort', 'get', 'record', 'deal', 'only', 'get', 'cut', 'off', '15', 'seconds', 'talking', 'then', 'new', 'section', 'However', 'small', 'beefs', 'aside', 'DVD', 'plenty', 'everything', 'alot', 'insight', 'struggles', 'hard', 'work', 'Corrs', 'have', 'put', 'make', 'where', 'are', 'compared', 'duration', 'documentaries', 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'quited', 'well.THE', 'CORRS', 'LIVE', 'IN', 'GENEVAPerhaps', 'most', 'exciting', 'factor', 'Corrs', 'Live', 'Geneva', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'noticed', ""'large"", 'change', 'one', 'DVD', 'next', 'were', 'differences', 'first', 'few', 'concert', 'Dvds', 'alot', 'tracks', 'seemed', 'be', 'same', 'thing', 'again', 'more', 'less', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'same', 'thing', 'were', 'doing', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Right', 'word', 'go', 'firts', 'song', 'so', 'long', 'been', 'Only', 'when', 'sleep', 'been', 'changed', 'opinion', 'change', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'change', 'none', 'less', 'Also', 'first', 'time', 'Corrs', 'have', 'enough', 'albums', 'released', 'be', 'quite', 'few', 'fan', 'favorite', 'songs', 'left', 'out', 'order', 'keep', 'concert', '3', '4', 'hours.A', 'big', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'long', 'time', 'addition', 'couple', 'guitar', 'solos', 'extended', 'instrumentals', 'songs', 'such', 'What', 'Can', 'do', 'A', 'positive', 'move', 'Corrs.I', 'love', 'Corrs', 'Andrea', 'lead', 'singer', 'bits', 'however', 'wish', 'Andrea', 'would', 'stop', 'yelling', 'non', 'stop', '90', '%', 'instrument', 'breaks', 'just', 'tone', 'down', 'little', 'only', 'when', 'tuin', 'whistle', 'mouth', 'get', 'great', 'extended', 'uninterupted', 'intrumental', 'break.Sound', 'DTS', 'sound', 'great', 'however', 'definantly', 'not', 'perfect', 'when', 'compare', 'other', 'dvd', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'excuse', 'day', 'age', 'modern', 'concert', 'should', 'be', 'almost', 'perfect', 'clarity', 'mixing', 'mostly', 'great', 'dynamics', 'energy', 'be', 'lost', 'parts', 'songs', 'poor', 'mixing', 'feathers', 'as', 'unexciting', 'have', 'heard', 'Overall', 'definantly', 'good', 'enough', 'sound', 'get', 'feel', 'though.Video', 'video', 'quality', 'fine', 'alot', 'shots', 'musicians', 'only', 'thing', 'little', 'bit', 'lacking', 'shots', 'crowd', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'worry', 'all.Set', 'List', 'Again', 'new', 'albums', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'time', 'fit', 'great', 'songs', 'am', 'glad', 'still', 'have', 'plenty', 'great', 'old', 'stuff', 'whilst', 'including', ""'better"", ""'borrowed"", 'heaven', 'album', 'Sunshine', ""'Long"", 'night', 'fit', 'really', 'well', 'sets', 'couple', 'less', 'well.Performance', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'mentioned', 'was', 'change', 'previous', 'performances', 'extended', 'solos', 'thought', ""'radio"", 'was', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'still', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'fun', 'time', 'guess', 'really', 'hard', 'when', 'are', 'comparing', 'ever', 'performance', ""'Lansdowne"", 'Road', 'think', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'topped', 'what', 'was', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'think', 'Accordian', 'frontiers', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'me.Overall', 'up', 'when', 'down', 'are', 'fan', 'Corrs', 'will', 'love', 'are', 'new', 'COrrs', 'will', 'love', 'easy', 'pick', 'few', 'minor', 'flaws', 'still', 'great']",All the Way Home: A History of the Corrs

The one-star rating has to do with the fact that when I received this DVD in the mail, it was NOT in the North American Region 1 format but the European PAL format which is incompatible on DVD players in the U.S.I'll admit that I am pretty biased when it comes to The Corrs music. I'm a big fan of theirs and many other Irish bands. When I discovered that the U.S. release of this DVD was not going to include the ""All The Way Home"" documentary (the reason why I wanted the DVD in the first place), I rushed at the opportunity to grab the import. I found it to be personally special that the DVD showed up in my mailbox on St. Patrick's Day. Well, the excitement turned to utter disgust when I placed the DVD in my player and it wouldn't play!!! It was only then that I discovered the PAL region symbol on the back cover.Apparently, after reading the other reviews and 'non-reviews' on this product, I am not the only victim of this happening. This is a shame because 99% of the time, Amazon is on the ball with accuracy on what they sell.Unfortunately, I am unable to submit a genuine review on what looks like another excellent addition to ones Corrs collection. Until I receive this in a playable format, I will repeat what others have stated here: Be on the lookout and be prepared!!! If you order this DVD, you may or may not receive one that's compatible with your DVD equipment. It looks like some have been fortunate and received a genuine Region 1 version. So, they ARE out there. Unfortunately, I'm not one of those customers.....yet.Hopefully soon though.

935510,A1ERWR5A8OVLDH,B000AYQJ4C,M. R. Reynolds,"[11, 22]","The Corrs DVD set I received was marked ""Import.""  Do I care?  Well now I sure do because the two DVDs in the set will not play on my Toshiba DVD player and also will not play on my Dell laptop DVD player.  The DVD set box says ""Region codes: 2,3,4,5.""  What is missing is the United States region code 1.  Somehow I don't think it's proper for Amazon to sell incompatible DVDs to U.S. customers.  In order to share my disappointment with Amazon I'm sending the DVDs back for a refund and will reorder this great DVD set when Amazon offers a U.S. version.  I also ordered The Corrs Home CD with the All The Way Home DVD set.  The CD arrived with a broken plastic case even though it was properly outside boxed by Amazon.  I'm keeping the CD because it will play on my laptop.If you live in region 2,3,4 or 5 and love the Corrs then you will really like this DVD set which shows you the history of how the Corrs gained success.

935512,A1CGF9EUDEUQJA,B000AYQJ4C,Rodrigo Medina,"[4, 6]","As a true fan of the corrs, since 1997, I can say this DVD set is a must-have product for every fan. The documentary ""all the way home"" shows all the ups and downs of the band throughout their career and the efforts they have to make after the release of every album. For those who imagined that the corrs life is all about glamour and success will find out, in this documentary, that there are many challenges on pop music and luckly they managed to overcome them, becoming one of the most successfull bands all over the world. The documentary, divided in acts, shows the corrs since the very beginning of their dream, playing pop songs on Jim's home studio. Then, we see the band playing in Dublin pubs, persuing their dream. After joining the cast of ""The Commitments"", where they met their manager John Huges, the Corrs signed with Atlantic Records and started their career. It's very surprising to learn that ""Talk on Corners"", their second album, once the best selling album in UK, was not an immediate hit and demanded a lot of promotion to get on charts.The DVD extras are cool, showing the band singing for the Pope, in a navy boat and in an embarassing situation, where they had to sing the US Star spangled banner in a football game and mics did not work. Poor corrs!The second DVD, with Live in Geneva concert, is great, with the Corrs hits and new music from ""Borrowed Heaven"" CD. It's live music, played by a very talented band, with a touch of magic, as always. I love this concert, with the comeback of Caroline, who was not following the band through the tour, in 2004, due to her pregnancy of a second child.The question that remains unanswered, after you watch the DVDs: Will the Corrs continue as a band? How much effort are they supposed to make, sacrificing their personal lives, to follow with this dream? We know that ""Home"" album, the last one released by the corrs, with irish covers of traditional music, represents the end of a full circle on their career. But is it all over? I hope not, because the Corrs have much more to offer to the world and we are looking forward to listen to a new album, with great pop songs, tours and promotions all over the globe, especially in South America, where we have been waiting for them for ages.Don't think twice and bring home this DVD set, with the history of the corrs and a great concert, which may be their farewell tour, as they've stated.",5,the definitive Corrs DVD!,1142726400,"03 19, 2006",2006,2412,"['true', 'fan', 'corrs', '1997', 'can', 'say', 'DVD', 'set', 'must-have', 'product', 'fan', 'documentary', 'way', 'home', 'ups', 'downs', 'band', 'career', 'efforts', 'have', 'make', 'release', 'album', 'who', 'imagined', 'corrs', 'life', 'glamour', 'success', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'documentary', 'are', 'many', 'challenges', 'pop', 'music', 'luckly', 'managed', 'overcome', 'becoming', 'one', 'most', 'successfull', 'bands', 'world', 'documentary', 'divided', 'acts', 'corrs', 'very', 'beginning', 'dream', 'playing', 'pop', 'songs', 'Jim', 'home', 'studio', 'Then', 'see', 'band', 'playing', 'Dublin', 'pubs', 'persuing', 'dream', 'joining', 'cast', 'Commitments', 'where', 'met', 'manager', 'John', 'Huges', 'Corrs', 'signed', 'Atlantic', 'Records', 'started', 'career', 'very', 'surprising', 'learn', 'Talk', 'Corners', 'second', 'album', 'once', 'best', 'selling', 'album', 'UK', 'was', 'not', 'immediate', 'hit', 'demanded', 'lot', 'promotion', 'get', 'charts.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'cool', 'showing', 'band', 'singing', 'Pope', 'navy', 'boat', 'embarassing', 'situation', 'where', 'had', 'sing', 'US', 'Star', 'spangled', 'banner', 'football', 'game', 'mics', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'Poor', 'corrs', 'second', 'DVD', 'Live', 'Geneva', 'concert', 'great', 'Corrs', 'hits', 'new', 'music', 'Borrowed', 'Heaven', 'CD', 'live', 'music', 'played', 'very', 'talented', 'band', 'touch', 'magic', 'always', 'love', 'concert', 'comeback', 'Caroline', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'following', 'band', 'tour', '2004', 'due', 'pregnancy', 'second', 'child.The', 'question', 'unanswered', 'watch', 'DVDs', 'Will', 'Corrs', 'continue', 'band', 'How', 'much', 'effort', 'are', 'supposed', 'make', 'sacrificing', 'personal', 'lives', 'follow', 'dream', 'know', 'Home', 'album', 'last', 'one', 'released', 'corrs', 'irish', 'covers', 'traditional', 'music', 'end', 'full', 'circle', 'career', 'hope', 'not', 'Corrs', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'offer', 'world', 'are', 'looking', 'forward', 'listen', 'new', 'album', 'great', 'pop', 'songs', 'tours', 'promotions', 'globe', 'especially', 'South', 'America', 'where', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'ages.Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'twice', 'bring', 'home', 'DVD', 'set', 'history', 'corrs', 'great', 'concert', 'may', 'be', 'farewell', 'tour', ""'ve"", 'stated']",All the Way Home: A History of the Corrs
