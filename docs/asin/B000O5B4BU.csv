I ordered this because we like Timothy Olyphant, especially Justified, and had heard good things about this series.  We could not get passed the first 15 minutes of the show.  The language is so filthy that we could not stand to watch another minute of it. The show may be very good.  It certainly has a strong cast of talented actors.  However, the language is so fowl and every sentence is filled with so many unnecessary cuss words that we simply had to turn it off.  We are not prudes, are not easily offended and use our share of bad lauguage.  Nothing, however, to compare with the language in this series.  I should have known since it was produced by HBO.

1062267,A2YW1SOKOLNG2,B000O5B4BU,"Amazon Customer ""Movie Fan""","[3, 4]","HBO's Deadwood is one of the best westerns I have ever seen.  It is very revisionist, in the sense that it does not really meet ones expectations of a western.  First, it takes place in the Black Hills in the Dakota territory, not in Arizona, New Mexico or Kansas.  I used to live in Rapid City, not far from the town of Deadwood and I got a tickle out of hearing about places and events that were local to the area.  That said, the revisionist aspect of this story is what is so great about it, because this is probably what the real old west was really like.  Some observations from the show, good and bad.1.)  The most talked about criticismof the show is the swearing.  I have to agree that there is WAY too much.  Not that I am a prude and that my ears started bleeding or anything, it's just that the swearing is very modern in its using, using terms that did not enter into the common vernacular until the 20th century.  This may seem like a really prudish nitpick, but it is really glaring.  The rest of the show gets everything else right from the sights, attitudes, costumes and locales, that this is very off-putting.  It is almost as odd as seeing Wild Bill Hickock draw an M-16 and shoot somebody.  It takes away from an otherwise great show.  This is the ONLY reason I gave this a 4-star review rather than 5-stars.2.) Ian McShane's protrayal of Al Swearingen is one of the most morally complex characters in modern story telling.  He starts off as a murdering killer, a runner of prostitues and drugs and unofficial boss of the town.  This is a man that would and does kill anyone at the drop of a hat.  But, like most people in real life, the more you get to understand his point of view and what caused him to act the way he does, you realize he may be the most honest and upright citizen in the whole town, especially as foreign influences start creeping in.  You would never think that such a cruel, evil man could be the bulwark defender of a new city, but he is.  And it doesn't seem contrived, but fits perfectly into his motivations and world view.3.) The same goes for the rest of the cast.  Everyone has secrets and odd motivators to their actions that don't always turn out the way you think they will.  The show is always unpredictable, and that is what made it great.4.)  The show ended too abruptly.  I am not exactly sure what possessed HBO to cancel the show since it was one of the top-rated shows on television.  But because of the abrupt cancelation, it ends very abruptly and strangely with the way the story was going.  However, maybe that is the way real life works.  In any case, it was perfectly in tune with the way the show worked.The show is, like most HBO shows, definitely in hard R territory and should not be watched by people with children or who have delicate sensibilities.  The characters are often hard, cruel and merciless, but that was the world they inhabited and the situations of the times.  One should not kid themselves that the old west was like a John Wayne or Bonanza scenario where fights, while common, are faily bloodless and killing is sterile.  The old west was dirty, violent and brutish.  But it is where a lot of our culture today came evolved from, and to understand where we are, we have to understand where we have been.  While I am not saying this is an accurate historical document, because it is fictional, it is a good lens into the past and what life was really like.",4,"One of the best ""bad"" guys ever!",1326240000,"01 11, 2012",2012,3444,"['HBO', 'Deadwood', 'one', 'best', 'westerns', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'very', 'revisionist', 'sense', 'not', 'really', 'meet', 'ones', 'expectations', 'western', 'First', 'place', 'Black', 'Hills', 'Dakota', 'territory', 'not', 'Arizona', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Kansas', 'used', 'live', 'Rapid', 'City', 'not', 'far', 'town', 'Deadwood', 'got', 'tickle', 'hearing', 'places', 'events', 'were', 'local', 'area', 'said', 'revisionist', 'aspect', 'story', 'what', 'so', 'great', 'probably', 'what', 'real', 'old', 'west', 'was', 'really', 'like', 'observations', 'show', 'good', 'bad.1', 'most', 'talked', 'criticismof', 'show', 'swearing', 'have', 'agree', 'WAY', 'too', 'much', 'Not', 'am', 'prude', 'ears', 'started', 'bleeding', 'anything', 'just', 'swearing', 'very', 'modern', 'using', 'using', 'terms', 'did', 'not', 'enter', 'common', 'vernacular', '20th', 'century', 'may', 'seem', 'really', 'prudish', 'nitpick', 'really', 'glaring', 'rest', 'show', 'everything', 'else', 'right', 'sights', 'attitudes', 'costumes', 'locales', 'very', 'off-putting', 'almost', 'as', 'odd', 'seeing', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Hickock', 'draw', 'M-16', 'shoot', 'somebody', 'away', 'otherwise', 'great', 'show', 'ONLY', 'reason', 'gave', '4-star', 'review', 'rather', '5-stars.2', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'protrayal', 'Al', 'Swearingen', 'one', 'most', 'morally', 'complex', 'characters', 'modern', 'story', 'telling', 'off', 'murdering', 'killer', 'runner', 'prostitues', 'drugs', 'unofficial', 'boss', 'town', 'man', 'would', 'kill', 'anyone', 'drop', 'hat', 'most', 'people', 'real', 'life', 'more', 'get', 'understand', 'point', 'view', 'what', 'caused', 'act', 'way', 'realize', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'honest', 'upright', 'citizen', 'whole', 'town', 'especially', 'foreign', 'influences', 'start', 'creeping', 'would', 'never', 'think', 'cruel', 'evil', 'man', 'could', 'be', 'bulwark', 'defender', 'new', 'city', ""n't"", 'seem', 'contrived', 'perfectly', 'motivations', 'world', 'view.3', 'same', 'rest', 'cast', 'Everyone', 'secrets', 'odd', 'motivators', 'actions', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'turn', 'out', 'way', 'think', 'will', 'show', 'always', 'unpredictable', 'what', 'made', 'great.4', 'show', 'ended', 'too', 'abruptly', 'am', 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'what', 'possessed', 'HBO', 'cancel', 'show', 'was', 'one', 'top-rated', 'shows', 'television', 'abrupt', 'cancelation', 'very', 'abruptly', 'strangely', 'way', 'story', 'was', 'going', 'However', 'maybe', 'way', 'real', 'life', 'works', 'case', 'was', 'perfectly', 'tune', 'way', 'show', 'worked.The', 'show', 'most', 'HBO', 'shows', 'definitely', 'hard', 'R', 'territory', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'watched', 'people', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'delicate', 'sensibilities', 'characters', 'are', 'often', 'hard', 'cruel', 'merciless', 'was', 'world', 'inhabited', 'situations', 'times', 'One', 'should', 'not', 'kid', 'old', 'west', 'was', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Bonanza', 'scenario', 'where', 'fights', 'common', 'are', 'faily', 'bloodless', 'killing', 'sterile', 'old', 'west', 'was', 'dirty', 'violent', 'brutish', 'where', 'lot', 'culture', 'today', 'came', 'evolved', 'understand', 'where', 'are', 'have', 'understand', 'where', 'have', 'been', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'accurate', 'historical', 'document', 'fictional', 'good', 'lens', 'past', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'really', 'like']",Deadwood: The Complete Seasons 1-3

1062269,A1AYNQ4Q8AZ0X,B000O5B4BU,anonymous,"[3, 8]","I didn't watch this series when it aired on HBO, but thought I'd like it based on all the hype surrounding it.  I took a chance and bought it when Amazon made it their deal of the day.  Warning: there are spoilers ahead.I was surprised to learn early on in the first season that Timothy Olyphant was not the star of the show despite getting top billing in the opening credits.  That honor belonged to Ian McShane, as his character, Al Swearegen, basically ran the town from the Gem Saloon.  He pulled the strings of the town's doctor, newspaperman, sheriff--even the mayor--just to name a few.  He had plenty of minions to carry out his orders, but he wasn't above committing murder himself.  Though the show opened with Olyphant's character, Seth Bullock, moving to Deadwood and setting up a hardware store with his friend, Sol Star, the focus quickly moved to Swearegen and his machinations.  I often wondered if that was always the plan or if the producers took a different course once they saw how limited Olyphant's acting skills were.  Within a few episodes, I began to suspect he was hired more for his looks than his talent so the producers could have at least one handsome actor onboard.  His acting wasn't horrible, just limited and underwhelming.  I had the same thoughts about the actress chosen to play Joanie Stubbs: she was the prettiest female in the cast, but she often appeared emotionless and wooden.We're introduced to many colorful characters, but I found a lot of them to be incredibly irritating because they were angry almost every time they appeared on screen.  Cy Tolliver (Powers Boothe) comes to mind first.  When he wasn't barking at those around him, he was usually whining like a baby over the fact that Joanie, his favorite whore, left him.  It got old long before the end of Season 1, and unfortunately, it lasted through the series' entire run.  Next, there was Trixie, Al's favorite prostitute.  She yelled at everyone--even friends--like Alma Garrett and Sol.  I frequently wondered what her motivation was for being mad when the person she was screaming at was treating her with respect and kindness, such as when Sol taught her accounting.  George Hearst was another angry soul, who was portrayed as an enormous jerk the whole time he was in town.  And Calamity Jane wasn't just a drunk, she was an angry drunk... constantly.I know this show was critically acclaimed for its language, but most of the time I found it annoying.  I'm not referring to the abundant swearing; I'm referring to the lack of normal, plain talk.  Watching this series was kind of like reading Shakespeare: you knew the dialog was spoken in English, but when a character finished speaking you sometimes had no idea what was said.  Many of the characters in this show spoke this way, but E.B. Farnum (William Sanders) was easily the worst culprit.  He could never give a simple answer, and his manner of speaking quickly got on my nerves.  I cringed every time he was in a scene.  Charlie Utter had a similar long-winded way of speaking that also tested my patience.I don't know how closely the show followed the history of real events, but some of the storylines didn't seem to have a point or were hard to believe.  After Joanie left Cy, she established her own brothel.  It quickly crumbled after a serial killer murdered some of her hookers.  From that point on, her character floundered, serving no real purpose except to be the show's token lesbian.  (It was an HBO series, after all, so there had to be a lesbian.) Same with Calamity Jane.  I know she was a resident in the real Deadwood, but in this show she didn't do much except serve as mild comic relief (and the object of Joanie's flirtations).  Then there was the theater troop.  Aside from amateur night at the theater, where the townspeople provided a few laughs by showing off their so-called talents, this storyline bored me to death.  Perhaps the writers were trying to reflect real life by including it, but I think they could have made it more interesting by making it pivotal to the main plot.  Instead, it seemed more like an afterthought that was tacked on.I don't know how much of a bully the real George Hearst was, but that's how he was portrayed in this series.  When he cut off Swearegen's finger, I expected Al to retaliate in some way but he let it go.  When Hearst had Mr. Ellsworth killed in order to scare Alma into selling her share to him, she sought Swearegen's protection.  Rather than discouraging Alma from giving into Hearst, he let her sell to him.  Then when Trixie shot Hearst, Swearegen killed a whore who looked like her in order to save Trixie and placate Hearst.  Of course the show didn't want to re-write history by having Hearst murdered while he was in Deadwood, but the events the writers scripted led this viewer to expect a showdown between Hearst and Swearegen (or at least a scene where Swearegen finally stood up to Hearst).  Instead, Hearst was allowed to safely leave town, and the tension that had been building all season simply fizzled out.Aside from the aforementioned lackluster performances, most of the actors did well, and the production values were really high.  The costumes and town itself looked very believable.  The Blu-ray packaging is quite nice: it looks like a hardback book.  One minor quibble about the packaging is that there are no printed episode descriptions.  There are episode titles in the packaging, but I usually find episode descriptions more helpful than titles.  You'll find episode descriptions in the disc menus, but if you've lost track of where you left off you won't know if you've put the wrong disc in your player until after the fact.Overall, the show was interesting enough to watch all 36 episodes, but that may have had more to do with the fact that I had already paid for all 3 seasons.  Had I bought Season 1 by itself, I probably wouldn't have purchased the remaining two seasons.  I kept hoping the show would grow on me and would have a satisfying conclusion, but unfortunately, HBO canceled it before that happened.  I gave it 3 stars because in Amazon's rating system it means ""it's ok."" I'll be selling or trading in my ""Deadwood"" set.",3,Not Great. Not Bad.

It wasn't till I discovered the T101 channel on Direct TV that I had my formal introduction to Deadwood. I had mixed feelings about watching, as I'm not too impressed with a lot of these made for TV endeavors, but as a life long fan of westerns and historical dramas, I had to at least check this series out.The first Deadwood I happen to catch was Season 2, Episode 1. The very first thing to impress me were the sets and the clothes. It was obvious someone had done their homework. As authentic as anything I've seen. I was equally impressed by the dialogue. It didn't take me a whole episode to realize the acting was top notch as well. I was coming back for more, though I didn't have a clue what was going on. This went on for a few weeks. I was totally absorbed, figuring out who most of the main people were, but knew I'd missed a lot. There was no way I could wait a few months for the series to start over. I got the whole set and devoured every episode from start to finish in about two weeks (3 or 4 episodes a night, sometimes fighting to stay awake because I just couldn't stop watching).This is, in my opinion, the finest television show ever made. Everyone involved with the show seemed to be giving 110%. Writing, direction and production are without peers. Brilliant entertainment! Every actor involved perfectly fits their part, from the leads to the extras. All are superb, but if I were to single out any for special praise, it would be Ian McShane and Robin Weigert. Unlike so many shows, though, this one isn't ""carried"" by the leads. All the parts add up to perfection.People can complain about liberties taken with historical persons all they want. This is historical fiction, and to my knowledge, they never passed it off as anything more. The historical characters add a  greater sense of realism as does the setting in a real place and year, instesd of just some made up town out west. I assure you this has as much if not more basis in fact than many a show and movie that was advertised as a true story. Above all, this is to entertain, and it accomplishes that purpose. I'm on my third viewing and still pick up on numerous things I missed. The only fault I find with this show is that there's only 36 episodes, and that being said, I'm thankful for everyone of them.

1062272,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B000O5B4BU,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[1, 2]","1876, the Black Hills of Dakota Territory. The discovery of gold has inspired thousands of people to break a treaty with the natives and flock to the area to prospect. The camp of Deadwood has been established to cater for their needs and is rapidly expanding into a large town. In such circumstances there lies opportunity, and the criminally-minded Al Swearengen, wanted for murder in Chicago, has set up his own saloon to cash in on such opportunities.Swearengen's operations are complicated by the arrival of the noted Wild West figures Calamity Jane, Wild Bill Hickok and Charlie Utter, as well as the establishment of a rival hotel and casino across the road from his own joint and the arrival of a former Montana marshal, Seth Bullock, who is looking to open a hardware store. With native attacks still a threat and a cholera outbreak striking the town, Deadwood needs to negotiate some perilous waters if it is to survive.Deadwood is widely considered to be one of the jewels in HBO's crown. Running for three seasons from 2004 to 2006, the series has attracted critical acclaim matched by perhaps only two other shows in TV history: The Sopranos and The Wire. Unlike those shows, Deadwood was not able to complete its planned storylines and ended prematurely in 2006 for reasons that are still disputed between the show's creator and the studio.The first season establishes the basic premise of Deadwood: the depiction of the slow metamorphosis of the settlement from a mining camp to a proper Western town. In the first episode, the town is shown to be lawless and almost anarchic. Over the course of the season the institutions of law, order and governance come into being, with in some cases the corrupt figures of the early episodes becoming 'respectable' figures in the new order. This shift is marked by one particular murder, which has significant ramifications for the town and its future. This gives the first season its thematic structure, the arising of order out of chaos.The writing is exemplary, with David Milch and his writers (although Milch effectively rewrote every script in the season himself) creating a cadence rooted in both historical accuracy and also in getting across the feel of the period. The high levels of modern swearing, for example, are not particularly accurate but Milch felt this was necessary as the contemporary curse words would not resonate with a modern audience. This also extends to the general accuracy of events. Many of the show's characters are real historical figures, with their activities being a mixture of historically real events, real events that have been condensed or moved around in time for dramatic effect, and totally new scenes that better illuminate the characters and themes of the series. If there is a problem in the writing it's the lack of consistency in the use of some devices: E.B. Farnum's tendency to slip into monologue is rather intermittent, for example. Otherwise it's rich, textured and often amusing.Performance-wise, the show features excellent turns from the likes of Timothy Olyphant (as Seth Bullock), Keith Carradine (Hickok), Paula Malcomson (Trixie), Doc Cochran (Brad Dourif) and Molly Parker (Alma Garret), but it revolves around Ian McShane in the role of Swearengen. Swearengen sits at the heart of the series, affecting events around him, like a particularly profane spider in his web. McShane, previously best known as the title role in the easy-goin' British detective series Lovejoy, is a revelation in this role, bringing phenomenal presence and menace to the screen. The characterisation of all of the characters is particularly accomplished, with a real focus on making them real, conflicted people. For example, a bald surface reading of the show would cast Olyphant's Seth Bullock as the hero, standing up to the villainous Swearengen, but in fact the two characters are also shown in the opposing role as well, such as when Bullock loses his temper and almost beats someone to death in a disproportionate response to a threat, whilst Swearengen shows mercy - albeit of a rough kind - and kindness to a desperately ill member of the community. This layering extends to all of the characters, making them much more compelling.Production values are impressive, with huge sets depicting the town and its interiors. It isn't an action-packed series, with considerably more talking than shooting, but when things do go off, they go off in style.Flaws are almost non-existent. Some events feel somewhat random, but this may be down to the show being as interested in depicting moments showing day-to-day life in Deadwood as it is in ongoing story arcs. In fact, arguably the most successful episode of the first season is the tenth, which shows a typical 'day in the life' of the town aside from all of the other ongoing shenanigans.The first season of Deadwood (*****) lives up to the show's reputation and billing as a gripping, entertaining and highly compelling drama series showing the realities of life in the West rather than the myth.",5,A

It would be easy to write this show off as gratuitous, but at its core, ""Deadwood"" has compelling, extremely well written storylines (at least for the first two seasons).  On the one hand, it's too bad they didn't tone down some of the ""raw"" aspects of this show because it may have garnered a bigger audience (most of the negative reviews you'll see here are for series' abrasive content), but then on the other hand it wouldn't be ""Deadwood"" without it. In the extra features, Milch and company do explain why the show is presented the way it is - also telling is Milch's lament as to why the series was terminated after just three seaons (credit to HBO for including Milch's ""rant"" in the extras).If you can look past the ""grit,"" the first two seasons of ""Deadwood"" rank amongst the finest shows HBO has ever offered.

1062305,A29M5BP9M3WWGM,B000O5B4BU,Don T. Hun,"[5, 9]","I read some of the cautionary tales of other customers about the quality of the dvds of Deadwood series.  One customer recommended inserting all dvds to make sure they played.  I did just that.  Two dvds at first couldn't be read.  I reseated them and they played.  I noticed overall that the dvds are a bit smaller than the player's space for dvds.  So far, I have not had a problem with seating dvds with this particular player.  Now I am sweating that all the dvds will play fully.I do wish that the warranty was extended just in case there is a problem later on past the 30 days because I know it will take me much longer to view the series.I do look forward to watching the series which, from customer reviews and other sources, is said to be excellent.1/8/11I completed the series a couple of days ago.  I would like to comment on the condition of the dvds.  On disk 4, episode 10 I had problems loading.  I had to load twice before the dvd would be read and played.  On disk 5 I noticed a crack towards the outside rim, but it played okay.  What I did to make sure that the dvds did not get scratched in the cardboard holder was put all the disks in jewel cases for safe keeping.As for the content of the series, I compliment the set designer.  It really looked like the real Deadwood.  I especially like the bonus parts which covered the historical aspects of Deadwood.  I was in Deadwood in 1998 and the commentaries made me realize that I missed some of the sights.I have mixed feelings about the dialogue.  Though Milch and McShane said that the coarse language gave a sense of the roughness of Deadwood during that period, I believe that less is better.  I have seen many movies over the years that gave a sense of what a place was without the blue language and this is from someone who is an army veteran.As for the script, the series started to appear to me as a soap opera.Milch's comments on the value of being true to the characters (artistic license) seems to fall flat to me.  Milch seemed to compromise the historical aspects of the characters unnecessarily.  Hickok had a high nasal voice as well as dressing like a dandy which may have brought on some challenges.  That Hickok was going blind was only hinted at in one scene.  I liked the acting by McShane of Swearengen.  The character had depth.  Ditto Callie as Utter, Hawkens as Star, Weigert as Jane, and Dourif as Doc Cochran.How did I like it overall, I was entertained but somewhat frustrated because I study history.  I am not an actor, a writer, a producer, so I cannot claim to be knowledgeable about those skills.Thank you,Don",3,3 stars with caution,1292544000,"12 17, 2010",2010,2610,"['read', 'cautionary', 'tales', 'other', 'customers', 'quality', 'dvds', 'Deadwood', 'series', 'One', 'customer', 'recommended', 'inserting', 'dvds', 'make', 'sure', 'played', 'did', 'just', 'Two', 'dvds', 'first', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'read', 'reseated', 'played', 'noticed', 'overall', 'dvds', 'are', 'bit', 'smaller', 'player', 'space', 'dvds', 'So', 'far', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'problem', 'seating', 'dvds', 'particular', 'player', 'Now', 'am', 'sweating', 'dvds', 'will', 'play', 'fully.I', 'do', 'wish', 'warranty', 'was', 'extended', 'just', 'case', 'problem', 'later', '30', 'days', 'know', 'will', 'take', 'much', 'longer', 'view', 'series.I', 'do', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'series', 'customer', 'reviews', 'other', 'sources', 'said', 'be', 'excellent.1/8/11I', 'completed', 'series', 'couple', 'days', 'ago', 'would', 'like', 'comment', 'condition', 'dvds', 'disk', '4', 'episode', '10', 'had', 'problems', 'loading', 'had', 'load', 'twice', 'dvd', 'would', 'be', 'read', 'played', 'disk', '5', 'noticed', 'crack', 'outside', 'rim', 'played', 'okay', 'What', 'did', 'make', 'sure', 'dvds', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'scratched', 'cardboard', 'holder', 'was', 'put', 'disks', 'jewel', 'cases', 'safe', 'keeping.As', 'content', 'series', 'compliment', 'set', 'designer', 'really', 'looked', 'real', 'Deadwood', 'especially', 'bonus', 'parts', 'covered', 'historical', 'aspects', 'Deadwood', 'was', 'Deadwood', '1998', 'commentaries', 'made', 'realize', 'missed', 'sights.I', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'dialogue', 'Milch', 'McShane', 'said', 'coarse', 'language', 'gave', 'sense', 'roughness', 'Deadwood', 'period', 'believe', 'less', 'better', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'movies', 'years', 'gave', 'sense', 'what', 'place', 'was', 'blue', 'language', 'someone', 'who', 'army', 'veteran.As', 'script', 'series', 'started', 'appear', 'soap', 'opera.Milch', 'comments', 'value', 'being', 'true', 'characters', 'artistic', 'license', 'fall', 'flat', 'Milch', 'seemed', 'compromise', 'historical', 'aspects', 'characters', 'unnecessarily', 'Hickok', 'had', 'high', 'nasal', 'voice', 'as', 'well', 'dressing', 'dandy', 'may', 'have', 'brought', 'challenges', 'Hickok', 'was', 'going', 'blind', 'was', 'only', 'hinted', 'one', 'scene', 'liked', 'acting', 'McShane', 'Swearengen', 'character', 'had', 'depth', 'Ditto', 'Callie', 'Utter', 'Hawkens', 'Star', 'Weigert', 'Jane', 'Dourif', 'Doc', 'Cochran.How', 'did', 'overall', 'was', 'entertained', 'somewhat', 'frustrated', 'study', 'history', 'am', 'not', 'actor', 'writer', 'producer', 'can', 'not', 'claim', 'be', 'knowledgeable', 'skills.Thank', 'Don']",Deadwood: The Complete Seasons 1-3

In my search for a western with semblance, I came across Deadwood just recently. After watching the first episode, I was completely intrigued and taken in. The true nature of the time was captured in a realistic manner---leaving a trail of blood and guts to linger. From human eating pigs to a runaway horse, the story was never complete and always moving. The villain is likely to win the hearts and minds as the owner of the Gem Saloon. The monologues in some ways were overdrawn and somewhat painful to get through but the dialogue throughout the series was like being in a theater. Could it be possible that people actually had the knowledge to talk the way they did back in that time-period. For an uneducated lot of cutthroats and con-men, they sure had a way with words. I also wonder where the old-money came from---the people who had it, really had a lot, and those who had nothing really did have no way to gain an upper hand.I would have liked to see more of Wyatt Earp but his character was short lived. Also, why a great gunfighter like Wild Bill would not have his back against the wall in a saloon did not make any sense. Calamity Jane had a weird character--sometimes tough and at other times a wimp. She had too much dialogue in the series but was a formidable character.The Doc did not have the same makings of a doctor of a town in the old west. He was hard to like and even hard to attach too. He had some good traits but sometimes talked about things that really did not matter. Was a driving force of sensibility but for some reason it was not drawn out in his character. Toward the end, when he was talking about the little girl experiencing the loss of her parents---he really did not make sense of it all.The fight scenes were challenging to watch due to the graphic violence---but were probably as realistic at the time as possible. Beating a young girl in the middle of the street and feeding her to the pigs left much to be desired. Tollerver's, the second big Saloon owner, old friend disappeared in a weird way and I guess he took some money and ran---this could have been established better.The end of the series 3 was a real drawback to the whole entire three. For sure, there were supposed to be a few more, or at least one more series. Ian McShane carried the movie--especially when he talked to the chopped off Indian head in a box---his character was certainly tarnished from what was a terrible childhood.

The real life town saw the likes of Wild Bill Hickok (Keith Carradine), Wyatt Earp (Gale Harold), Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant), Al Swearengen (Ian McShane), Sol Star (John Hawkes), and George Hearst (Gerald McRaney), father of newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst whom the movie ""Citizen Kane"" was based on. These and many other historical figures litter the various episodes intermingling fact with fiction.The town is a microcosm of how civilization develops as various peoples come together. Initially lawless, parameters become established that allow the town to survive and prosper with the various individuals and factions competing for their share of the wealth in this gold mining town. Perhaps what is most interesting are the various dynamics and power shifts that develop, initially between the two main town employers, the Gem and The Bella Union saloons, and then between them and the newcomer, the successful California businessman and prospector, George Hearst, and how these dynamics shift given the various circumstances that unfold. Being a small town these dynamics are very volatile, and felt by each and every one of the town's inhabitants. For a rich and moving characterization of an emerging town and its various people, Deadwood offers a vivid and visceral recreation of the how civilization develops.This blu-ray set is elegantly packaged, though some may not like the fact that the discs are fit into cardboard sleeves instead of the typical plastic holders.",5,Civilization at its roots...,1306108800,"05 23, 2011",2011,1638,"['Deadwood', 'set', '1870s', 'based', 'mining', 'town', 'same', 'name', 'South', 'Dakota', 'annexation', 'Dakota', 'Territory', 'real', 'life', 'town', 'saw', 'likes', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Hickok', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'Gale', 'Harold', 'Seth', 'Bullock', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'Al', 'Swearengen', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'Sol', 'Star', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'George', 'Hearst', 'Gerald', 'McRaney', 'father', 'newspaper', 'publisher', 'William', 'Randolph', 'Hearst', 'whom', 'movie', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'was', 'based', 'many', 'other', 'historical', 'figures', 'litter', 'various', 'episodes', 'intermingling', 'fact', 'fiction.The', 'town', 'microcosm', 'how', 'civilization', 'various', 'peoples', 'come', 'together', 'Initially', 'lawless', 'become', 'established', 'allow', 'town', 'survive', 'prosper', 'various', 'individuals', 'factions', 'competing', 'share', 'wealth', 'gold', 'mining', 'town', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'most', 'interesting', 'are', 'various', 'dynamics', 'power', 'shifts', 'develop', 'initially', 'two', 'main', 'town', 'employers', 'Gem', 'Bella', 'Union', 'saloons', 'then', 'newcomer', 'successful', 'California', 'businessman', 'prospector', 'George', 'Hearst', 'how', 'dynamics', 'shift', 'given', 'various', 'circumstances', 'unfold', 'Being', 'small', 'town', 'dynamics', 'are', 'very', 'volatile', 'felt', 'one', 'town', 'inhabitants', 'rich', 'moving', 'characterization', 'emerging', 'town', 'various', 'people', 'Deadwood', 'vivid', 'visceral', 'recreation', 'how', 'civilization', 'blu-ray', 'set', 'elegantly', 'packaged', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'fact', 'discs', 'are', 'fit', 'cardboard', 'sleeves', 'instead', 'typical', 'plastic', 'holders']",Deadwood: The Complete Seasons 1-3

This is an extremely well-written show about the real Wild West. There's a chock full of heavy profanity, sex, obscenities, and very little gunplay. This isn't John Wayne's universe, and this CERTAINLY ISN'T Will Smith's universe, either. David Milch has done a fantastic job with this series.What I like most about ""Deadwood"" are the countless characters that make the show. It's very hard to pick a favorite, really. Ian Mcshane and Timothy Olyphany give superb performances as Al Searengen and Seth Bullock (Swearengen being the cold-blooded owner of a saloon, and Bullock being the owner of a hardware store). William Sanderson is brilliant as E.B. Farnum, a hotel owner with a social problem. Brad Dourif's performance is oscar-worthy as Doc Cochran, a man who has seen it all in the Civil War. Cy Tolliver (played by Powers Boothe) is one character that you'll love to hate. Alma Garrett (Molly Parker) is a bit annoying in the first few episodes, but she develops and you'll grow to admire her because of her complexities. A more complex female character is Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert), whose alcoholism and vulgarity makes a stark contrast for her caring for little children and for those who are sick.

The kind of programming that pretty much only it and AMC have on right now. This show is crude, offensive, shocking, sensitive, endearing, hurtful, and amazing all at once. With the power struggle that happens between the three main powers of the show, and after watching Game of Thrones, it will show like comparison to the underlying story. Different factions, all trying for power positions in the world. The world in this case, being Deadwood, SD during the Panhandling Gold Rush. The casting in this show is bar none, and the performances given by many characters, high and low on the totem pole, are absolutely stunning. Ian Mcshane makes one of the most stern, honest, brutal, yet somehow likeable characters in any show I have watched, film or TV. Timothy Olyphant, wooden walk and all, makes a great bid in his role and performs it well, but a lot of the background characters reall push this to excellence. There are so many actors in here, odds are you will not know all the names without looking, but it is fun watching this with friends and seeing them say, &#34;Hey there's Lassie from Monk, Bobby from Supernatural, Wormtongue from Lord of the Rings, JF Sebastian from Blade Runner!&#34; Whomever was in charge of and actually secured all this talent onto one show should be given a raise.While not a show for kids at all, and completely unrepentant, it will hit every nerve and facet of Old West living. From the huge amounts of swearing, alcohol, drugs, prostitution, murder, robbery... it is all there and in your face non stop. Some I have discussed with found it even TOO much for them to handle and distracted them from enjoying the show. I think you have to put past our modern day thinking and realise the time set we are watching and how they spoke, and you will get much more out of it. They did a lot of fact checking and include many historical figures, places, events, and information that also begs the watcher to invest themselves more into the world and look into them. I grew up in South Dakota not far from Deadwood so it was not new to me, but knowing the material and information only increased my enjoyment of the series as I watched, as I could relate to what was being presented on screen.The complete series set was purchased for just over $65 during the Gold Box Sale and is worth every penny. The packaging it comes in is simple and elegant, with a nice framing, thick cover box. Inside, the whole series is bound into a facsimile book with a disc in every turn of the pages, each of those featuring a character, picture, and quote. Some are quite humorous. It takes up less space than one season of Game of Thrones, looks sleek, and makes getting the discs in and out a breeze. All in all, if you can get used to the lingo anf lifestyle of Deadwood, you will have a heck of a ride through this series, now saddle up!",5,"A Western Game of Thrones, But Set In South Dakota History!",1378857600,"09 11, 2013",2013,2945,"['Deadwood', 'brilliant', 'enthralling', 'series', 'HBO', 'knocked', 'park', 'kind', 'programming', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'AMC', 'have', 'right', 'now', 'show', 'crude', 'offensive', 'shocking', 'sensitive', 'endearing', 'hurtful', 'amazing', 'once', 'power', 'struggle', 'three', 'main', 'powers', 'show', 'watching', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'will', 'show', 'comparison', 'underlying', 'story', 'Different', 'factions', 'trying', 'power', 'positions', 'world', 'world', 'case', 'being', 'Deadwood', 'SD', 'Panhandling', 'Gold', 'Rush', 'casting', 'show', 'bar', 'none', 'performances', 'given', 'many', 'characters', 'high', 'low', 'totem', 'pole', 'are', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'Ian', 'Mcshane', 'one', 'most', 'stern', 'honest', 'brutal', 'somehow', 'likeable', 'characters', 'show', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'TV', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'wooden', 'walk', 'great', 'bid', 'role', 'well', 'lot', 'background', 'characters', 'reall', 'push', 'excellence', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'actors', 'here', 'odds', 'are', 'will', 'not', 'know', 'names', 'looking', 'fun', 'watching', 'friends', 'seeing', 'say', '34', 'Hey', 'Lassie', 'Monk', 'Bobby', 'Supernatural', 'Wormtongue', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'JF', 'Sebastian', 'Blade', 'Runner', '34', 'Whomever', 'was', 'charge', 'actually', 'secured', 'talent', 'one', 'show', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'raise.While', 'not', 'show', 'kids', 'completely', 'unrepentant', 'will', 'hit', 'nerve', 'facet', 'Old', 'West', 'living', 'huge', 'amounts', 'swearing', 'alcohol', 'drugs', 'prostitution', 'murder', 'robbery', 'there', 'face', 'non', 'stop', 'have', 'discussed', 'found', 'even', 'TOO', 'much', 'handle', 'distracted', 'enjoying', 'show', 'think', 'have', 'put', 'modern', 'day', 'thinking', 'realise', 'time', 'set', 'are', 'watching', 'how', 'spoke', 'will', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'did', 'lot', 'fact', 'checking', 'include', 'many', 'historical', 'figures', 'places', 'events', 'information', 'also', 'watcher', 'invest', 'more', 'world', 'look', 'grew', 'up', 'South', 'Dakota', 'not', 'far', 'Deadwood', 'was', 'not', 'new', 'knowing', 'material', 'information', 'only', 'increased', 'enjoyment', 'series', 'watched', 'could', 'relate', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'presented', 'screen.The', 'complete', 'series', 'set', 'was', 'purchased', 'just', '65', 'Gold', 'Box', 'Sale', 'worth', 'penny', 'packaging', 'simple', 'elegant', 'nice', 'framing', 'thick', 'cover', 'box', 'Inside', 'whole', 'series', 'bound', 'facsimile', 'book', 'disc', 'turn', 'pages', 'featuring', 'character', 'picture', 'quote', 'are', 'quite', 'humorous', 'up', 'less', 'space', 'one', 'season', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'sleek', 'getting', 'discs', 'breeze', 'can', 'get', 'used', 'lingo', 'anf', 'lifestyle', 'Deadwood', 'will', 'have', 'heck', 'ride', 'series', 'now', 'up']",Deadwood: The Complete Seasons 1-3

1062335,A3TIM4HEBLH0NP,B000O5B4BU,"John A. Aragon ""The Rock""","[40, 45]","First, ""Deadwood"" has the most constantly profane and racist language, and graphic sex and violence I have ever seen on mainstream film. So, those who are offended by material of this nature should not watch. But if you can get past that, ""Deadwood"" is brilliant.Let me begin by giving an example of the writing. In the following scene, Al Swearengen, Deadwood's  ruthless leader, deplores the fact that the self righteous Sheriff, Bullock, is too involved in his adulterous affair with Alma (who controls a rich gold mine) to focus on the political struggles the community is facing in its attempt to be annexed into the United States. Swearengen watches Bullock leave the hotel after being with Alma. One of Swearengen's men remarks that Bullock means no disrespect. Swearengen replies:""Horror is, you are f**kin' right. He don't know if he's breathin' or takin' it through f**kin' gills. He is that f**king c**t-struck. They're afloat. In some fairy f**kin' bubble, lighter than air, him, her snatch, and his stupid f**kin' badge...Self-deceiving c**k-sucker I am, I thought, when America took us in, Bullock would prove a f**kin' resource. Look at him, stridin' out like some randy, maniac Bishop.""""Deadwood"" is a true western because it is the story of the creation of a community on the frontier. The town of Deadwood was born when gold was discovered in the Black Hills, lands ceded to the Sioux by treaty. All kinds of non-Native Americans, Europeans, and Chinese invaded the area. This action was illegal under the laws of the United States and, of course, considered grounds for war by the Sioux. So, the people who founded Deadwood, of every class, were all true outlaws. And Deadwood had no law but custom and the knife and gun. In three seasons, ""Deadwood"" tells the story of how the town was founded and ultimately annexed to Dakota Territory.Many of the characters portrayed are based on historical personages. Formost  among them is Al Swearengen the ""Bloody King of Deadwood,"" who operated the town's first saloon and bordello. Swearengen is played by Ian McShane. It is the role of McShane's career and he is astounding. As the episodes progress, Swearengen's charachter  evolves to amazing complexity, far beyond the simple villain he at first appears. We come to root with guilty pleasure for Swearengen, the murderer and whoremonger, and to admire his cunning as he allies with Bullock and others who attempt to hold their own against even worse and more powerful and morally corrupt forces; Cy Tolliver, the despicable overlord of a competing gambling house, Wolcott, mining engineer, serial killer of prostitutes and agent of the ruthless, implacable mining magnate, George Hearst, and against corrupt and idiotic politicians from Yankton who would deprive Deadwood's founders of political rights of self determination.The thing I enjoyed most about ""Deadwood"" is the fact that it is brilliantly and blatantly Shakespearian. Scenes of high drama are artfully alternated with comic vignettes. A number of characters actually engage in soliloquies with strange yet understandable sentence structure. It is surprising and pleasing to see how well such scenes work in a western. For example, Swearengen keeps the head of a dead Indian in a box. When he is beset by fools, his lackeys, Swearengen, like Hamlet to Yoric, confides his feelings, questions and stratagems to ""The Chief."" In one such scene, Swearengen complains to The Chief about one of his men. Swearengen says:""Dead, and without a body, you still outstrip him for intelligence.""There are a few pure and good souls represented in this savage work. Calamity Jane, played by Robin Weigert is a true Shakespearian ""wise fool."" In one of my favorite scenes (it made me laugh and cry) Calamity visits the grave of the murdered Wild Bill Hickock, who she adored. It is her custom each night to tell Wild Bill the news of Deadwood. On this night, she is joined by Charlie Udder, Wild Bill's other closest friend. She allows Charlie to tell Wild Bill the news. But he breaks down. He asks Calamity:""Can I...can I tell `im some more tomorra?""Calamity replies with kindness:""Sure. What the f**k you askin' me for? I don't make the rules.""The scene is at once melancholy, hilarious, and profound. And there are many such scenes in this brilliant masterpiece.""Deadwood"" is an innovation, in the American western, so profound that it will be studied by many over time. Whether it will ever be matched is an open question.",5,A profound innovation in the American western,1213747200,"06 18, 2008",2008,4490,"['First', 'Deadwood', 'most', 'constantly', 'profane', 'racist', 'language', 'graphic', 'sex', 'violence', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'mainstream', 'film', 'So', 'who', 'are', 'offended', 'material', 'nature', 'should', 'not', 'watch', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'Deadwood', 'brilliant.Let', 'begin', 'giving', 'example', 'writing', 'following', 'scene', 'Al', 'Swearengen', 'Deadwood', 'ruthless', 'leader', 'fact', 'self', 'righteous', 'Sheriff', 'Bullock', 'too', 'involved', 'adulterous', 'affair', 'Alma', 'who', 'rich', 'gold', 'mine', 'focus', 'political', 'community', 'facing', 'attempt', 'be', 'annexed', 'United', 'States', 'Swearengen', 'Bullock', 'leave', 'hotel', 'being', 'Alma', 'One', 'Swearengen', 'men', 'remarks', 'Bullock', 'disrespect', 'Swearengen', 'replies', 'Horror', 'are', 'f**kin', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'breathin', 'takin', 'f**kin', 'gills', 'f**king', 'c**t-struck', ""'re"", 'afloat', 'fairy', 'f**kin', 'bubble', 'lighter', 'air', 'snatch', 'stupid', 'f**kin', 'badge', 'Self-deceiving', 'c**k-sucker', 'am', 'thought', 'when', 'America', 'took', 'Bullock', 'would', 'prove', 'f**kin', 'resource', 'Look', 'stridin', 'out', 'randy', 'maniac', 'Bishop', 'Deadwood', 'true', 'western', 'story', 'creation', 'community', 'frontier', 'town', 'Deadwood', 'was', 'born', 'when', 'gold', 'was', 'discovered', 'Black', 'Hills', 'ceded', 'Sioux', 'treaty', 'kinds', 'non-Native', 'Americans', 'Europeans', 'Chinese', 'invaded', 'area', 'action', 'was', 'illegal', 'laws', 'United', 'States', 'course', 'considered', 'grounds', 'war', 'Sioux', 'So', 'people', 'who', 'founded', 'Deadwood', 'class', 'were', 'true', 'outlaws', 'Deadwood', 'had', 'law', 'custom', 'knife', 'gun', 'three', 'seasons', 'Deadwood', 'story', 'how', 'town', 'was', 'founded', 'ultimately', 'annexed', 'Dakota', 'Territory.Many', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'are', 'based', 'historical', 'personages', 'Formost', 'Al', 'Swearengen', 'Bloody', 'King', 'Deadwood', 'who', 'operated', 'town', 'first', 'saloon', 'bordello', 'Swearengen', 'played', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'role', 'McShane', 'career', 'astounding', 'episodes', 'progress', 'Swearengen', 'charachter', 'amazing', 'complexity', 'far', 'simple', 'villain', 'first', 'come', 'root', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'Swearengen', 'murderer', 'whoremonger', 'admire', 'cunning', 'Bullock', 'others', 'who', 'attempt', 'hold', 'own', 'even', 'worse', 'more', 'powerful', 'morally', 'corrupt', 'forces', 'Cy', 'Tolliver', 'despicable', 'overlord', 'competing', 'gambling', 'house', 'Wolcott', 'mining', 'engineer', 'serial', 'killer', 'prostitutes', 'agent', 'ruthless', 'implacable', 'mining', 'magnate', 'George', 'Hearst', 'corrupt', 'idiotic', 'politicians', 'Yankton', 'who', 'would', 'deprive', 'Deadwood', 'founders', 'political', 'rights', 'self', 'determination.The', 'thing', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'Deadwood', 'fact', 'brilliantly', 'blatantly', 'Shakespearian', 'Scenes', 'high', 'drama', 'are', 'artfully', 'alternated', 'comic', 'vignettes', 'number', 'characters', 'actually', 'engage', 'soliloquies', 'strange', 'yet', 'understandable', 'sentence', 'structure', 'surprising', 'pleasing', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'such', 'scenes', 'work', 'western', 'example', 'Swearengen', 'head', 'dead', 'Indian', 'box', 'When', 'beset', 'fools', 'lackeys', 'Swearengen', 'Hamlet', 'Yoric', 'feelings', 'questions', 'Chief', 'one', 'such', 'scene', 'Swearengen', 'Chief', 'one', 'men', 'Swearengen', 'Dead', 'body', 'still', 'outstrip', 'intelligence', 'are', 'few', 'pure', 'good', 'souls', 'represented', 'savage', 'work', 'Calamity', 'Jane', 'played', 'Robin', 'Weigert', 'true', 'Shakespearian', 'wise', 'fool', 'one', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'made', 'laugh', 'cry', 'Calamity', 'grave', 'murdered', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Hickock', 'who', 'adored', 'custom', 'night', 'tell', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'news', 'Deadwood', 'night', 'joined', 'Charlie', 'Udder', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'other', 'closest', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'tell', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'news', 'down', 'Calamity', 'Can', 'can', 'tell', 'im', 'more', 'tomorra', 'Calamity', 'kindness', 'Sure', 'What', 'f**k', 'askin', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'rules', 'scene', 'once', 'melancholy', 'hilarious', 'profound', 'are', 'many', 'such', 'scenes', 'brilliant', 'masterpiece', 'Deadwood', 'innovation', 'American', 'western', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'studied', 'many', 'time', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'matched', 'open', 'question']",Deadwood: The Complete Seasons 1-3

1062338,AYNAA33DXK6L8,B000O5B4BU,Jonathan Kissel,"[440, 462]","Of all the TV series I have watched beginning to end, Deadwood is the one I keep coming back to.  Even though I've seen every episode countless times, I still pick up something new with each viewing.  It still makes me laugh.  It still makes me think.  It still gives me chills, and it still makes me cry.  It is a brilliant man, executive producer and head writer David Milch, at the peak of his powers as a storyteller.  Watching Deadwood is like reading a 1200 page novel from 150 years ago.  Broad themes in a small setting, complex and conflicted characters, and detailed scenery make for a completely immersive experience.The plot of the series revolves around where order and community come from.  Deadwood was settled outside of U.S. territory in the 1870's after a gold rush, thus leaving it in complete anarchy.  Each of the three seasons is well-structured in terms of conflict.  The first season deals with how the inhabitants of the town arrange themselves in this lawless town.  The second season has the varying factions band together to thwart an invasive government.  The third season pits the town against the hyper-capitalism of mining magnate George Hearst.  Within that structure is several smaller stories that both manage to stand alone and meld with the larger themes.The real strength of Deadwood is the characters.  Milch has created perfectly fleshed-out portrayals of historical figures and some made-up ones, too.  Saloon owner Al Swearengen is a ruthless operator who cannot help but long for an easier, more peaceful way.  Seth Bullock demands justice from those around him, but constantly surrenders to his temper and his libido.  Calamity Jane is a many layered character, tough and kind, offensive and caring, vulnerable and impenetrable all at the same time.  These are only a sampling of the many deep and conflicted characters in the show.  By the third season, there were nearly 30 cast regulars, all of which were people you genuinely cared about.The only thing that could keep people away from Deadwood is the language.  Milch is a lover of dialogue, and he writes in complicated verse.  More than one viewing is required to even catch the most basic plots and motivations.  What can be equally off-putting is the vulgarity.  Those with sensitve ears can expect to be bombarded with f-bombs on a semi-sentence basis.  If you're having a hard time getting through the first couple episodes, check out the extras on the first season.  Milch explains why he wrote the way he did in a way that made perfect sense to me, both from a creative and an historical sense.  In those extras, he will divulge a lot of spoilers, but it's far better to experience the series than be turned off by its profanity.The Complete DVD set, in addition to the many commentaries and extras included in the original single season releases, contains new material that makes the upgrade worth it.  Milch explains where he would've taken Deadwood had he been allowed to continue it in the most valuable addition.  A lengthy roundtable discussion with the actors is very entertaining.  Also included is actor Titus Welliver giving a handful of convincing impressions of actors auditioning for the part of Swearengen.  The size of this set also equals one single season release, so if your shelf space is limited, the complete series set gets another plus.In closing, Deadwood affected me more than any TV show I've ever watched.  I jumped out of my chair to cheer on Dan while he fought Hearst's man Captain Turner in a brutal fight to the death.  I quote Calamity Jane's beautiful description of a revealing dream.  I cried when Jewel asks Doc to ""give her a whirl.""  I could feel the joy in the town after Tom Nuttal's big ride.  For anyone who wants the most out of their TV shows, Deadwood is truly perfect.",5,The pinnacle of modern storytelling.,1228867200,"12 10, 2008",2008,3822,"['TV', 'series', 'have', 'watched', 'beginning', 'end', 'Deadwood', 'one', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'Even', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episode', 'countless', 'times', 'still', 'pick', 'up', 'something', 'new', 'viewing', 'still', 'still', 'think', 'still', 'chills', 'still', 'cry', 'brilliant', 'man', 'executive', 'producer', 'head', 'writer', 'David', 'Milch', 'peak', 'powers', 'storyteller', 'Watching', 'Deadwood', 'reading', '1200', 'page', 'novel', '150', 'years', 'ago', 'Broad', 'themes', 'small', 'setting', 'complex', 'conflicted', 'characters', 'detailed', 'scenery', 'make', 'completely', 'immersive', 'experience.The', 'plot', 'series', 'where', 'order', 'community', 'come', 'Deadwood', 'was', 'settled', 'outside', 'U.S.', 'territory', '1870', 'gold', 'rush', 'thus', 'leaving', 'complete', 'anarchy', 'three', 'seasons', 'well-structured', 'terms', 'conflict', 'first', 'season', 'deals', 'how', 'inhabitants', 'town', 'arrange', 'lawless', 'town', 'second', 'season', 'varying', 'factions', 'band', 'together', 'thwart', 'invasive', 'government', 'third', 'season', 'town', 'hyper-capitalism', 'mining', 'magnate', 'George', 'Hearst', 'structure', 'several', 'smaller', 'stories', 'manage', 'stand', 'alone', 'meld', 'larger', 'themes.The', 'real', 'strength', 'Deadwood', 'characters', 'Milch', 'created', 'perfectly', 'fleshed-out', 'portrayals', 'historical', 'figures', 'made-up', 'ones', 'too', 'Saloon', 'owner', 'Al', 'Swearengen', 'ruthless', 'operator', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'long', 'easier', 'more', 'peaceful', 'way', 'Seth', 'Bullock', 'demands', 'justice', 'constantly', 'surrenders', 'temper', 'libido', 'Calamity', 'Jane', 'many', 'layered', 'character', 'tough', 'kind', 'offensive', 'caring', 'vulnerable', 'impenetrable', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'only', 'sampling', 'many', 'deep', 'conflicted', 'characters', 'show', 'third', 'season', 'were', 'nearly', '30', 'cast', 'regulars', 'were', 'people', 'genuinely', 'cared', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'keep', 'people', 'away', 'Deadwood', 'language', 'Milch', 'lover', 'dialogue', 'complicated', 'verse', 'More', 'one', 'viewing', 'required', 'even', 'catch', 'most', 'basic', 'plots', 'motivations', 'What', 'can', 'be', 'equally', 'off-putting', 'vulgarity', 'sensitve', 'ears', 'can', 'expect', 'be', 'bombarded', 'f-bombs', 'semi-sentence', 'basis', ""'re"", 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'check', 'out', 'extras', 'first', 'season', 'Milch', 'why', 'wrote', 'way', 'did', 'way', 'made', 'perfect', 'sense', 'creative', 'historical', 'sense', 'extras', 'will', 'divulge', 'lot', 'spoilers', 'far', 'better', 'experience', 'series', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'profanity.The', 'Complete', 'DVD', 'set', 'addition', 'many', 'commentaries', 'extras', 'included', 'original', 'single', 'season', 'releases', 'new', 'material', 'upgrade', 'worth', 'Milch', 'where', 'would', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'Deadwood', 'had', 'been', 'allowed', 'continue', 'most', 'valuable', 'addition', 'lengthy', 'roundtable', 'discussion', 'actors', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Also', 'included', 'actor', 'Titus', 'Welliver', 'giving', 'handful', 'convincing', 'impressions', 'actors', 'auditioning', 'part', 'Swearengen', 'size', 'set', 'also', 'one', 'single', 'season', 'release', 'shelf', 'space', 'limited', 'complete', 'series', 'set', 'plus.In', 'closing', 'Deadwood', 'affected', 'more', 'TV', 'show', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'jumped', 'chair', 'cheer', 'Dan', 'fought', 'Hearst', 'man', 'Captain', 'Turner', 'brutal', 'fight', 'death', 'quote', 'Calamity', 'Jane', 'beautiful', 'description', 'revealing', 'dream', 'cried', 'when', 'Jewel', 'Doc', 'give', 'whirl', 'could', 'feel', 'joy', 'town', 'Tom', 'Nuttal', 'big', 'ride', 'anyone', 'who', 'most', 'TV', 'shows', 'Deadwood', 'truly', 'perfect']",Deadwood: The Complete Seasons 1-3

Historically they seemed to get the names of people and the town correct, but that is about it. The foul language for such a show in its time setting should have been a clue this was 90% plus HBO / Hollywood...truth took a back seat to this series. It is almost like the worst of today punk street thugs were in charge of the script? Language so offensive that &#34;over the top&#34; is a serious understatement. It is like Hollywood and the DNC got together to corrupt the history of this story just as they have today's generation thus has helped create a culture of corruption, within government . This story is such a load of BS it is almost hard to watch, that no doubt led to it never going on to another season. I am ashamed I  bought such a foul mouth peace of garbage, and I am no prude, I work in the real world and the writing of the script is just pure garbage. By the ratings you would almost think every HBO employee was forced to write a 5 star rating...lol. I have to give credit where credit is due, 3 stars for acting, but the script gives it an unbiased -5 stars. So predictable of HBO / Hollywood...lol. They even tried to tie BS about racism within the culture toward American Indians, I have no doubt some of this was present during that time, but what Hollywood and current day history teachers say differs from the truth. Many American Indians partnered with with new American immigrants to fight savage Indian tribes..thus the calling of certain Indians as savages, some were, plain and simple others were reasonable and looked for allies to fight such savage tribes. That part so reminded me of brain dead family members that I have to hear about how bad American Indians were and are treated, I don't blame them, today many teachers are teaching from rewritten American history rather then the truth of what was written before the 20th century.",1,"What a Joke, story...yes.. 90%, historical ...about10% at the most.

But after that, the writing goes all over the place, and a fine group of character actors are just wasted, and given nothing to do. When the acting is better than the writing, all the actors can do is a lot of sassy dookey-polishing. The writers can't write female characters at all. It's embarrasing to watch. For all of seasons 2 and 3, the women just stand around wondering if they're gay or not. The only gal who is given a fair share of dialogue is Robin Weigert, who galumphs around like a foul-mouthed oompa loompa in male drag. The writers/producers bring in some black characters too, just to prove that they're Hollywood liberals, I guess. While it's fun to watch Franklyn Ajaye drink with Calamity Jane, he's never given anything interesting to do. The Asian character Wu has just one joke which is milked to death. Powers Boothe does an increasingly one note impression of Snidely Whiplash, snarling, hissing, and mean-mugging the whole time. Brad Dourif gives a committed and dynamic performance in the corny old role of the town doctor. The language is fun to listen to. But all the folks who say it's Shakespearian are blowing pretensious smoke up their own bung holes. When the writers can't figure out what else to do( a recurring problem), they stick Ian McShane with a kidney stone. This gross out lasts half a season or so. Ian McShane's Swearengen has a fresh shot of whiskey in his hand in every new frame. Swearengen's drinking pace seems to be about 2 or 3 fifths a day. When the writers can't figure out a new spin on an over-used cuss word, they have Swearengen pour more shots. At that rate, any middle-aged guy would be dead in a month. Things liven up a bit when Gerald McRaney arrives with his Pinkerton goons. The ending is realistic enough, but mighty depressing. The only thing that holds this whole mess together is the charisma of Ian McShane, who is one of those charming, mercurial actors who could perform the phone book, and keep it compelling.

When they found out that Hearst had fixed the sheriff's race, they appointed Seth Bullock U.S. Marshall for the Dakota Territory.

They fly into an angry rage at the slightest exchange, that often seems overkill to me. The violence seems very extreme to me. For instance, pigs that eat dead people, that are owned by a Chinese man that only grunts and stares. How much human flesh can pigs eat, really? Apparently intelligent women presented as whores who are savagely beaten and then go sleep with the one who beat them to then be kicked out like trash in the morning?

1062368,A23KCYDJEPPQRU,B000O5B4BU,"~Morbius~ ""- Knower of Stuff -""","[0, 1]","First, I'd like to say that I don't spend my time writing reviews about anything... unless I feel pretty dad-burned strongly about it. Also- I try to be fair, even if I don't particularly like something. I mean, I can see that there's surely others who wouldn't agree... or may just have different 'tastes', than I.About ""Deadwood""....  If you have ANY interests in history... or 'the Old West', or 'the Wild West'... like it REALLY was, then you should keep reading. As a kid, all the way up to now (in my 50's), I never particularly liked Westerns. But in the last few years, I've developed a strong liking for the ones that were 'well done'. Like- the only John Wayne film I really kinda liked, was ""The Shootist"". Of course, the newer 'classics' like ""Dances with Wolves"", ""Tombstone"", and even ""Silverado"", I've enjoyed... and I consider worthy of my v-library.I had heard about ""Deadwood"" running on HBO, some time back... but wasn't an HBO subscriber, and never got a chance to watch it, until- DirecTv's exclusice ""101"" channel began running it... and in HI-DEF, too! (And yes... it WAS filmed in Hi-Def... not just a conversion). So, I was fortunate enough to be able to start with the first episode of season one.Ya know... at first, I suppose like a lot of people, I found it a little hard to follow the language (as in syntax)... as if, most of the verbiage seemed like it came out of a 'Victorian-era' book. However- there's a reason for that... and it's a good one. That's the way most people actually spoke back then... those who could read... that's what was available. And let's face it... entertainment 'HAS' evolved quite a bit in the last 125 years, or so. Also, in the 'bonus DVDs', there's an entire chapter about the speech... as well as the cussing (which is in great abundance!!!!!!)(I don't see how ""Deadwood"" could ever be edited or overdubbed for television, and still make sense, as well as be longer than three minutes per episode). But- that's a GOOD thing. Remember- we're talking about 'realism'... the way it really was... NOT the way the history books and Hollywood would have us all think.The next thing you need to know is- 'most' of the characters, were REAL-LIFE people. Seth Bullock, Wild Bill Hickock, Calamity Jane, Charlie Utter, Al Swearengen... these were all real people. Actors, some of whom you'll recognize, and some you may not... but they just can't be any better! Ian McShane; Brad Dourif; Powers Booth; Keith Carradine; W. Earl Brown... and so many others... Damn! They're perfect! And David Milch tries to follow the major (known) historical events, as much as possible. Also... this show was not written in advance, then the script run past countless studio executives, for them to P__ in, 'til they like the flavor... then rewritten several more times... no! David Milch and the writting staff wrote everything, usually the same day they shot it... and they improvise a great deal, often writing additional material because of something one of the actors may have done or said, yet still staying pretty dad-burned close to historical fact.The set-  wOw! Several blocks built just for this show... and researched incredibly well, so that you see exactly what you would see in old photographs of the period and location. It was a filthy era to live in, with little if any sanitation... and the show reflects that, as well. P**-pots, and everything else, back then, was routinely just thrown out into the street... so, there'd be a near constant mud, made from animal and human waste, trash, you name it... it was probably in there. Even the building materials are authentic... the same type, color, contruction styles (like wooden pegs)... just the way it really was (not some cleaned-up Hollywood executive's idea of how it should have been).The casting... absolutely top-notch... as is the acting... the effects... the blood, gore, and guts... animals slaughtered...  hell, people slaughtered, and fed to the pigs. You have authenticity in the hotel, brothels and saloons... the alcohol and drug use... and you very quickly find yourself relating to the characters... even, the 'bad guys', you kinda find yourself becoming attached to... and as the story evolves, you may even find yourself beginning to relate to them as well... seeing everyone as humans, with their good, and bad points. As one actor put it ""There are no black or white hats... everyone where's a different shade of gray"".I quickly found myself not only looking forward to the next episode, but since 'Lost' is likely in it's last season... or at least, spacing nearly a year between seasons has made me loose interest (being tired of waiting, and being at the whim of those in charge)... anyway- ""Deadwood"" is my new 'favorite show'. So much so, that I simply could not wait for my weekly 'Deadwood-fixes'... I bought 'The Complete Series' for myself, for Xmas... so I don't have to wait, and so I can review any parts I wish.Yep! All three seasons, plus four bonus-feature DVDs are included in the set. One has the creater/producer/director/writer David Milch taking us on a tour of 'Deadwood', and describing the 'conclusion' of the series... as if HBO (in it's infinite wisdom) hadn't cancelled the show (sure wasn't for lack of ratings).... anyway- how Milch sees how the fourth season, had there been one, would have likely gone.This is one of those few shows/films that you can watch over and over and over... and over again... some mo... and still continue to find new things that you missed before... either in the words/script... or acting/actors' performances... scenery/set... or even the extras. I can't say enough good s**** about 'Deadwood' (Ha! you though I was gonna say S***, when I was really gonna say 'Stuff').This has got to be the very best Western, ever! 'Authentic' should be in the title, somewhere!!! I suppose the only warning I'd give.... don;t let your kids watch or listen to it... 'cause the veriage 'taint what I'd call 'polite'... albeit very good, funny, and accurate for the time. You may find yourself asking why every-other word seems to be MF, and CS, and everything else in and out of the book... again- this is not your Hollywood version... this is the way it really was (check the bonus DVDs for more info on that.Buy it!

1062370,A2SA6LR78V49UV,B000O5B4BU,"OrangeCrush ""Still shooting with Film!""","[2, 3]","I wont go into an details of the series as most people have most likely already seen it or at least know what its about. Ill simply say that its hands down the greatest western ever created and that is saying something as there are some amazing westerns out there. While some get close, Deadwood easily takes the prize. I think this is honestly the most realistic series I have ever seen. Now its obvious that I didnt live during those times so my idea of realistic may in fact not be realistic however Deadwood portrays that time exactly how I imagine it would be, thus for me, it reaches a level of realism that is a cut above all of the other shows out there.I have now watched this series 4 times from start to finish and it hasnt even started to get old. I always borrowed my sisters copies when I wanted to watch it as I refused to pay 80+ dollars for 12 episode seasons. HBO pricing has always been something I have had strong feelings against and I just refused to cave in regardless of how much I liked the series. Imagine my surprise when I logged onto Amazon a few days back and came across the complete series on sale for 64.99. Thats less than 25 bucks a season and I am happy to say that I ordered it without hesitation. Good things come to those who wait and this set is without a single doubt a good thing. This is the price it should have been all along and its nice to see HBO finally getting some sense in regards to thier pricing as I have noticed a lot of other HBO sets coming down in price as well.As much as I love this series I simply have to mention its one weakness and that is the way the series ended. HBO really screwed the pooch ending this series the way they did, then again HBO has done this many times now (Deadwood, Rome, & Carnivale). What really upset me is how they came out and told everyone how they were going to produce a couple 2 hour movies to end the series properly and never ended up making those films. IMO they never had any intention of making those films and the only reason they came out and said that they were going to make them was to calm everyone down. People were so pissed that HBO cancelled the show that thier was a massive amount of cancellations taking place. There were even websites put up trying to convince people to drop HBO unless they made the 4th season that they originally intended to make. So they announced a couple movies to calm everyone down and to stop the mass defection. I was actually one of the people that dropped HBO and I still havent picked them back up. I just dont have any faith that they will follow through with thier series.Regardless of Deadwood's weak ending, its still hands down the best Western ever created and if you havent seen it yet, this box set and its new low price is a perfect reason for you to finally jump on board. You will never look at westerns the same way again. In a way I am jealous of those who have yet to see it. There is just nothing like seeing it for the first time. My set is on its way and ill soon be watching it for my 5th time.Deadwood = Best western ever!!",5,Best Western Ever Created!,1232668800,"01 23, 2009",2009,3086,"['wont', 'go', 'details', 'series', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'most', 'likely', 'already', 'seen', 'least', 'know', 'what', 'about', 'Ill', 'simply', 'say', 'hands', 'down', 'greatest', 'western', 'ever', 'created', 'saying', 'something', 'are', 'amazing', 'westerns', 'out', 'there', 'get', 'close', 'Deadwood', 'easily', 'prize', 'think', 'honestly', 'most', 'realistic', 'series', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Now', 'obvious', 'didnt', 'live', 'times', 'so', 'idea', 'realistic', 'may', 'fact', 'not', 'be', 'realistic', 'however', 'Deadwood', 'portrays', 'time', 'exactly', 'how', 'imagine', 'would', 'be', 'thus', 'level', 'realism', 'cut', 'other', 'out', 'there.I', 'have', 'now', 'watched', 'series', '4', 'times', 'start', 'finish', 'hasnt', 'even', 'started', 'get', 'old', 'always', 'borrowed', 'sisters', 'copies', 'when', 'wanted', 'watch', 'refused', 'pay', '80+', 'dollars', '12', 'episode', 'seasons', 'HBO', 'pricing', 'always', 'been', 'something', 'have', 'had', 'strong', 'feelings', 'just', 'refused', 'cave', 'regardless', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'series', 'Imagine', 'surprise', 'when', 'logged', 'Amazon', 'few', 'days', 'back', 'came', 'complete', 'series', 'sale', '64.99', 'Thats', 'less', '25', 'bucks', 'season', 'am', 'happy', 'say', 'ordered', 'hesitation', 'Good', 'things', 'come', 'who', 'wait', 'set', 'single', 'doubt', 'good', 'thing', 'price', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'along', 'nice', 'see', 'HBO', 'finally', 'getting', 'sense', 'regards', 'thier', 'pricing', 'have', 'noticed', 'lot', 'other', 'HBO', 'sets', 'coming', 'down', 'price', 'well.As', 'much', 'love', 'series', 'simply', 'have', 'mention', 'one', 'weakness', 'way', 'series', 'ended', 'HBO', 'really', 'screwed', 'pooch', 'ending', 'series', 'way', 'did', 'then', 'again', 'HBO', 'done', 'many', 'times', 'now', 'Deadwood', 'Rome', 'Carnivale', 'What', 'really', 'upset', 'how', 'came', 'out', 'told', 'everyone', 'how', 'were', 'going', 'produce', 'couple', '2', 'hour', 'movies', 'end', 'series', 'properly', 'never', 'ended', 'up', 'making', 'films', 'IMO', 'never', 'had', 'intention', 'making', 'films', 'only', 'reason', 'came', 'out', 'said', 'were', 'going', 'make', 'was', 'calm', 'everyone', 'down', 'People', 'were', 'so', 'pissed', 'HBO', 'cancelled', 'show', 'thier', 'was', 'massive', 'amount', 'cancellations', 'taking', 'place', 'were', 'even', 'websites', 'put', 'up', 'trying', 'convince', 'people', 'drop', 'HBO', 'made', '4th', 'season', 'originally', 'intended', 'make', 'announced', 'couple', 'movies', 'calm', 'everyone', 'down', 'stop', 'mass', 'defection', 'was', 'actually', 'one', 'people', 'dropped', 'HBO', 'still', 'havent', 'picked', 'back', 'just', 'dont', 'have', 'faith', 'will', 'follow', 'thier', 'series.Regardless', 'Deadwood', 'weak', 'ending', 'still', 'down', 'best', 'Western', 'ever', 'created', 'havent', 'seen', 'yet', 'box', 'set', 'new', 'low', 'price', 'perfect', 'reason', 'finally', 'jump', 'board', 'will', 'never', 'look', 'westerns', 'same', 'way', 'again', 'way', 'am', 'jealous', 'who', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'just', 'nothing', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'set', 'way', 'ill', 'soon', 'be', 'watching', '5th', 'time.Deadwood', '=', 'Best', 'western', 'ever']",Deadwood: The Complete Seasons 1-3

The Blu-ray version has excellent video and audio quality. While unlike Rome, this series takes place during a rather brief period of time (I keep wondering when Winter will arrive... as if conditions weren't bad enough already), there is no lack of material and the multi-faceted story lines all blend well into the overall story. While I initially bought this series primarily out of respect for Timothy Olyphants' acting skills (Justified), his role is much less prominent than I had expected. Nonetheless, the main character (Al Swearengen, played by Ian McShane) is certainly no disappointment. It should be noted, this is no series for delicate ears, nor for those who are offended by frequent and graphic references to various human bodily functions. This cast of characters is probably the dirtiest and filthiest of any I have ever seen or heard. Literally and figuratively. If this is truly how life was in this time and place, well, I am quite thankful for not having been alive then. On the other hand, that period of history certainly gave rise to some larger than life characters, and this series presents some of those in a very entertaining way, much as Rome did for the historical period it portrayed.

His showing makes two different things between the coward and the lapse of momentary fear... Let him doubt those he's trusted, this camp will run red with blood...The show centers on Seth Bullock, a young man with a powerful temper who got a lot of Hickok's qualities... But being a man with an active conscience Bullock declines to accept the horrors around him...We are rapidly introduced to most of the other important characters:Wild Bill Hickok--an asset to any saloon, and any joint he frequents--comes to look for business opportunity and sits there, losing at poker... He is the fastest gun around... While his respect for Bullock grows, he commissions 'Montana' to do a review of the Garret claim...Cochran--the town doctor who takes heat from Al Swearengen every time one of the whores is poorly sick--was full of opinion and took the most comprehensive view when he treated the bright widow... Now he doesn't feel at such perfect liberty to opine on her husband's case as he did on hers...E.B. Farnum--Judas Goat looking fellow, coyote-moving type--is Swearengen's water boy, the innkeeper of a thousand faces staring straight at extinction...Brom Garret--the nave city investor who had to go all his $20,000 to turn Farnum away and purchase a gold claim--pursues his remedies in some other fashion...Sophia--the little survivor--could settle who killed her people, road agents or Sioux...Jewel--born with difficulties and hardships that got no cure--wants the doctor to brace her leg so her dragging it doesn't drive Swearengen crazy...Charlie Utter--who considers himself an important hand at the freight business-- plays a man too loyal and honest for his own good...Whitney Ellsworth--who saw something he shouldn't have, a man pushed off from a ridge--seemed very competent and trustworthy...Mr. Wu--the only source of opium in the camp--finds a common language with Searengen when an opium theft occurs...Smith--the Reverend who has a distinct, clear set of morals--knows from past experience that it's a solace having friends...Ian McShane is a joy to watch... He gives a first-class performance as Al Swearengen, the oppressive boss who can order the execution of any man in the settlement with just a word... McShane who runs his Gem with the help of his cronies, emits power in every order he gives...While McShane is a marvelous villain who generates a palpable menace, Boothe is maniacally evil as Cy exuding despicable charm ... Well dressed Cy is the gentleman on the outside while more cruel as Swearengen in beating, kicking, and killing...Such a performer was found with Timothy Olyphant, very effective as a formal marshal who understands the danger of his own temperament... Seth Bullock stood before Alma Garret as a married man to his brother's widow after he was killed... He took their five-year-old boy as his own son...The 4 show women that are trapped in a man's world are: Molly Parker as Mrs. Garret, the beautiful addict wife who suspects foul play... She inevitably feels she's had some part in what befalls her husband; Kim Dickens as Joanie Stubbs, the very attractive solitary woman who uses to make Cy warm; Paula Malcomson as Trixie, the prostitute who must've done some fancy to keep Al from Killing her... She tries to help Alma with the orphaned child while keeping her master in the dark; Robin Weigert as Calamity Jane, the sewer mouth that follows Hickok around...

1062397,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B000O5B4BU,Steve,"[0, 0]","Deadwood's reputation, like many of HBO's series, precedes it, although in this case it's a mixed one. Critics cite Deadwood's unrelenting and extremely profane language (the compound word c-s-er is used so much, it becomes a source of comic relief), as well as considerable sex and violence. Given that some premium tv shows delve into gratuitous excess simply because they can, their real value can only be accurately measured by the writing and acting. In this case, Deadwood more than measures up favorably to its more famous peers. In my opinion, this is a prime example of television at its finest.To be honest, this unfortunately short-lived series took a while to set its hook. The first eight or so episodes had yet to convince me of anything special. Then, almost magically, things started to coalesce and I found myself deeply immersed in the drama, violence, and comedy of this program. To borrow upon the copious consumption of alcohol in the series, the impact crept up on me like the dizzy sensation you get after drinking one too many shots of whiskey. Before you realize it, you're knocked out.The biggest factor in the transformation, and the show's brightest star goes to Ian McShane who plays the irascible, acerbic, and intimidating Al Swearengen, the proprietor of the camp's main saloon/brothel The Gem. It was about the time that this character became fully fleshed out that the spell was finally cast. His character is without doubt the driving force in the series, but as in any quality program, one superb performance cannot alone sustain success. The mix of historical and fictional characters such as Sheriff Seth Bullock, Charlie Utter, E.B. Farnum, Sol Star, Dan Dohirty, Trixie, Doc Cochran, Alma Ellsworth, and Cy Tolliver are among some of the most engaging and well-crafted roles, each brilliantly portrayed. But it's the brilliant lines they are given that make this show so memorable and pleasurable. The writing is superb; flashing theatrical soliloquies with period-era, savage, and purposefully ludicrous ignorance, each perfectly counter-balancing each other. Simply put, if you're a fan of the English language, you'll relish the dialogue, and might even find it more rewarding to watch with the closed captioning on just so you don't miss a word.Over a mere thirty-six episodes, it won't take long to indulge in the entirety of this glorious reinvention of the Old West (I found the brief Earp brothers appearance to be particularly gratifying, given the near-deification of them in American cultural mythology). The worst part is that you'll doubtlessly end up longing for more. It's escapist joy with every tug on a whiskey bottle, every slosh through the muddy thoroughfare, every sexual escapade, every drop of blood, every weapon fired or knife wielded, and every palpable stench in this fetid frontier wonderland. Like Rome, another HBO historical drama that ended far too early, Deadwood walks the thin line between history and poetic license like an acrobat. Thankfully, despite the unintentional end, the final episode has a feeling of closure that is satisfactory enough to suppress the greed for more.

The Black Hills town of Deadwood is populated by illegal settlers, outlaws, prostitutes, gamblers, Chinese laborers, former soldiers, and the occasional family trying to survive.  The show is notable for its excessive portrayal of violence and dialogue laced with colorful vulgarity, but it features some remarkable acting as well.  Ian McShane as saloon owner Al Swearengen, Timothy Olyphant as former law enforcer Seth Bullock, and Keith Carradine as Wild Bill Hickok are standouts.  Using the dramatic device of combining fictional characters with actual historical figures (Calamity Jane, Hickok) successfully and setting the stories in a specific time period makes the series far more intriguing than earlier TV westerns like ""Bonanza"" and ""Gunsmoke,"" which seemed to exist exclusively on studio sets.

Day""","[3, 47]","The title, concept, language, and characters were ripped from the pages of Pete Dexter's book of the same name (and everything else). With that in mind, the first 3 shows of the first season were terrific; much better than Walter Hill's awful 1995 movie ""Wild Bill"" that was supposedly based on Dexter's book. After ""screenwriter"" Milch finished with Dexter's ideas, the show degenerated into repetitive character exposes with limited plot and some pretty unbelieveable scenes. The fact that Milch hasn't managed a coherent thought since the first couple of hours of Deadwood says it all. Whatever he did for NYPD Blue, non-withstanding.Casting Keith Carradine as Hickock was brilliant. Casting Dayton Callie as Charlie Utter was almost dumber than John Hurt in the same part in ""Wild Bill."" Making Hickock's best friend and partner into a frilly Brit is idiotic. The other characters lifted from Dexter's book were all over the place in appropriate-ness, believeablity, and consistency.As a native cowboy stater and dedicated fan of all things gritty and western, I desperately wanted to love Deadwood, especially after hearing comparisons to Lonesome Dove and other western classics. The reality was that this series is mostly a soap opera for men who particularly like hearing the same three explitives repeated ad nauseum.

I am glad I waited to see this show in it's entirety in the wide screen format in 2012, rather than catching some of the programs 6-8 years ago on HBO in analog, as this series was shot for HD.Deadwood is very different from the TV westerns I watched in the 20th century. Characters that continue from episode to episode don't have tenure as in other westerns, and can be killed quickly. A person who expires in Deadwood may be thrown to ravenous swine, who leave nothing behind. Gunplay, the major score settler in other westerns, takes a back seat in Deadwood to the knife, beatings, burnings, and being thrown off balconies. The western concept of the fair fight rarely occurs here, where accidents and disease up mortality rates. Many have said the character of Al Swerengen is the personification of evil, but in Deadwood, he is well balanced by Sy Tolliver, only the latter murders in a rage, whereas Al seems to enjoy it so much.Deadwood 1876-77 is clearly not as pleasant a place to live as television's version of Dodge or Virginia City, but like Gunsmoke and Bonanaza, the challenges faced by the fantastic cast of characters is not to be missed, and worth repeated viewings.

Merchant and former U.S. Marshall Seth Bollock (Timothy Olyphant) and Sol Star (John Hawkes) head to the prospecting town to open a hardware store for the miners.The married Bollock becomes involved with Alma Garrett (Molly Parker) after her husband is suckered into buying a gold mine that was believed to be tapped out. Garrett's husband is killed to cover up the scam by Al Swearengen's (Ian McShane) employee Dan Dority (W. Earl Brown).Wild Bill Hickock (Keith Carradine) asks Bollock to become Garrett's representative as Swearengen and others try and buy the claim from her. When Bollock's wife (Anna Gunn) arrives with her son, things become complicated for Bollock and things become further complicated as George Hearst arrives to try and buyby hook or by crook all the claims.END OF SPOILERS:A rich, marvelously written and imagined series (full of profanity, nudity, gore and sex--so be aware!), &#34;Deadwood&#34; may have been shot in the back by HBO of the head much like Hickock but that doesn't stop this from being essential viewing. Although Milch was offered funds (in a half hearted attempt to quell upset fans and Milch) to wrap things up in a pair of two hour movies, the series still stands very well on its own without having all the loose ends tied up. For those who haven't viewed all three seasons--rest assured that the story arc of season three is largely concluded.The blu-ray looks exceptionally good with a nice transfer with deep, rich blacks and colors that positively pop. You can almost taste the grit and smell the manure of the camp.The audio is top notch with a strong sounding  DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio mix that is immersive--you are put into the action of the series.The special features are exceptional for this set. We get a 17  commentary tracks for the entire series ( some episodes feature multiple commentary tracks and usually featuring the actors and/or writer-producer-creator David Milch) . We get four strong featurettes on the making of the first season including one on the real Deadwood.The second season includes a sequel short documentary on the historical Deadwood specific to the events of the season two along with a 70 minute documentary on the making of the last episode of season two giving valuable insights into the creative process of the show.The third season likewise features a short documentary on the events that occurred in real life in Deadwood and how they are reflected in the fictional series. We also get a featurette on the evolving relationship between Swearengen and Bollock. The second and third season also has photo galleries comparing the real characters to their fictional counterparts.The big plus with this three season set is the 13th disc that features exclusive where Milch discusses his reaction to the cancelation notice and the lack of follow through on the a possible fourth season or the pair of feature length films that HBO had offerred to bankroll to close out the series.  Milch is surprisingly honest about his feelings regarding all of this given that this was produced by HBO. We also get another historical featurette and a 60 minute question and answer discussion  with the cast of the show. Closing out the special features is &#34;Deadwood 360&#34; where Milch and his production designer give us a tour of the sets and an amusing &#34;Deadwood Audition Reel&#34; where comedian Titus Welliver impersonates famous actors as if they were auditioning for the Swearengen.The discs are housed in a hardcover &#34;book&#34; and slide out. For the DVD edition this was a bit more problematic as DVDs tend to scratch more easily than Blu-rays. If you're concerned about the discs becoming scratched you could put them in stand alone Blu-ray containers.Prematurely cancelled, &#34;Deadwood&#34; was (and remains) a terrific series with strong performances and writing.
