The gore and blood is not the centerpiece like you would find in slasher movies. This movie has a beautiful socially-redeeming plot. Real humans expressing honorable inter-personal emotions, made difficult by the requirements of the plot. The acting is superb; all actors did a great job with their roles.  Characters are believable and genuine. The most interesting character was played by Ariel Gade as Amy Wheeler, the central character's 11-year-old estranged daughter. Her bubbly and lovable personality add life to the scenes with her depressive father Kevin, played by Ken Boyd. In fact, there is so much going on in the interactions between the characters that the few scenes where there is blood seem insignificant. I am so glad that these gory scenes are very short. This movie should have been titled and marketed as a drama--crime thriller. The violent front cover of the DVD case does it a great disservice. If you can ignore the blood, you will be able to enjoy this beautiful movie, and you will experience a whole range of emotions for the characters.

The body count could have been higher and the horror elements could have been ratcheted up. I am a horror fan first and foremost, after all. Still, this is a very well acted and well plotted film. Barry Bostwick gives the best performance as a cop who doesn't know what the heck is going on when men in his town are being hacked to pieces. Then there is Karen Black as an unsympathetic mother to Kevin Corrigan's character. The twist ending didn't make much sense to me at first, but the more I think about, I guess it is plausible. I'll have to back and watch the movie again to make more sense of it, I guess.

1539092,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B007VYEDHO,C. Sawin,"[2, 2]","This is another example of how judging a book by its cover or not knowing much about a movie before hand can illustrate you being wrong, but it actually paying off. ""Some Guy Who Kills People"" appears to be an average slasher with an overdose amount of cheese injected into it, but it's actually a dark comedy more than anything. Ken's mom Ruth, portrayed by Karen Black, is overflowing with sarcasm and the town sheriff, Walt Fuller (Barry Bostwick), is a bit of an idiot who does nothing but tell inappropriate jokes. It sounds kind of harsh and cruel, but it's also pretty funny in the same vein as Bobcat Goldthwait's ""World's Greatest Dad"" or ""God Bless America.""The Amy Wheeler character (Ariel Gade) is your average little girl; never stops talking and is curious about everything. Meanwhile, Ken doesn't say much. It's kind of the beauty in his character. It keeps him mysterious, but it also illustrates how much his past has affected him. Once Ken and Amy have screen time together though, it's like there's instant chemistry. Amy drags answers out of Ken and her enthusiasm brings out the best in him. The characters have a lot more in common than they realize and it's almost as if they need each other to feel complete.One of the best comedic sequences in the movie is when Brett Miller (Jonathan Fraser) tries to scare off an intruder at the supply store. ""I was in the Green Berets, a**hole,"" he says. ""And the Navy Seals. And...I was in...Gettysburg!"" He fires off a few rounds and curses before saying, ""I think I still have bullets!"" It's just ridiculous and hilarious. With that said, the movie doesn't shy away from heavy violence either. Blood is constantly splattering on car windows or all over the hood of a car while somebody else is decapitated and another victim gets an axe to the skull. ""Some Guy Who Kills People"" never really doesn't feel like a horror movie and yet it so clearly isn't.Comedy and horror have always been attached in some capacity like Siamese twins who only really come together over the holidays, but ""Some Guy Who Kills People"" brings comedy and horror together in a way that feels unique. It already isn't taking itself too seriously, but the acting is pretty great as is the screenplay. The humor is actually funny and the gore isn't half bad. ""Some Guy Who Kills People"" blends horror and comedy into a pretty outstanding little movie that is one of the most uncommon features of the year.Special features include audio commentary with the director and writer/producer, the short film ""The Fifth"" which inspired the movie, a ""Making of"" featurette, and the official trailer. ""The Fifth"" is pretty great. It's about a group of guys just wanting to play poker when Ken brings a little too much work to the poker table. The ""Making of"" featurette is really cool, too. All of the special effects are practical and you get to see how they pulled off a lot of the death scenes. Plus the movie was made in only 16 days, which only makes it more impressive.""Some Guy Who Kills People"" will be available on DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment starting tomorrow, July 3rd. It's rated R for strong, bloody violence and language, has an anamorphic widescreen presentation with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio, with Dolby Surround 5.1 sound, and is approximately 97 minutes long.",4,A unique and blood-soaked dark comedy,1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,3308,"['example', 'how', 'judging', 'book', 'cover', 'not', 'knowing', 'much', 'movie', 'hand', 'can', 'illustrate', 'being', 'wrong', 'actually', 'paying', 'off', 'Guy', 'Who', 'People', 'be', 'average', 'slasher', 'overdose', 'amount', 'cheese', 'injected', 'actually', 'dark', 'comedy', 'more', 'anything', 'Ken', 'mom', 'Ruth', 'portrayed', 'Karen', 'Black', 'overflowing', 'sarcasm', 'town', 'sheriff', 'Walt', 'Fuller', 'Barry', 'Bostwick', 'bit', 'idiot', 'who', 'nothing', 'tell', 'inappropriate', 'jokes', 'kind', 'harsh', 'cruel', 'also', 'pretty', 'funny', 'same', 'vein', 'Bobcat', 'Goldthwait', 'World', 'Greatest', 'Dad', 'God', 'Bless', 'America', 'Amy', 'Wheeler', 'character', 'Ariel', 'Gade', 'average', 'little', 'girl', 'never', 'talking', 'curious', 'everything', 'Meanwhile', 'Ken', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'kind', 'beauty', 'character', 'mysterious', 'also', 'how', 'much', 'past', 'affected', 'Once', 'Ken', 'Amy', 'have', 'screen', 'time', 'together', 'instant', 'chemistry', 'Amy', 'answers', 'Ken', 'enthusiasm', 'out', 'best', 'characters', 'have', 'lot', 'more', 'common', 'realize', 'almost', 'need', 'other', 'feel', 'complete.One', 'best', 'comedic', 'sequences', 'movie', 'when', 'Brett', 'Miller', 'Jonathan', 'Fraser', 'scare', 'off', 'intruder', 'supply', 'store', 'was', 'Green', 'Berets', 'a**hole', 'Navy', 'Seals', 'was', 'Gettysburg', 'few', 'rounds', 'curses', 'saying', 'think', 'still', 'have', 'bullets', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'hilarious', 'said', 'movie', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'heavy', 'violence', 'Blood', 'constantly', 'splattering', 'car', 'windows', 'hood', 'car', 'somebody', 'else', 'decapitated', 'victim', 'axe', 'skull', 'Guy', 'Who', 'People', 'never', 'really', ""n't"", 'feel', 'horror', 'movie', 'yet', 'so', 'clearly', ""isn't.Comedy"", 'horror', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'attached', 'capacity', 'Siamese', 'twins', 'who', 'only', 'really', 'come', 'together', 'holidays', 'Guy', 'Who', 'People', 'comedy', 'horror', 'together', 'way', 'unique', 'already', ""n't"", 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'acting', 'pretty', 'great', 'screenplay', 'humor', 'actually', 'funny', 'gore', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', 'Guy', 'Who', 'People', 'horror', 'comedy', 'pretty', 'outstanding', 'little', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'uncommon', 'features', 'year.Special', 'features', 'include', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'writer/producer', 'short', 'film', 'Fifth', 'inspired', 'movie', 'Making', 'featurette', 'official', 'trailer', 'Fifth', 'pretty', 'great', 'group', 'guys', 'just', 'wanting', 'play', 'poker', 'when', 'Ken', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'work', 'poker', 'table', 'Making', 'featurette', 'really', 'cool', 'too', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'practical', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'pulled', 'off', 'lot', 'death', 'scenes', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'only', '16', 'days', 'only', 'more', 'impressive', 'Guy', 'Who', 'People', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'DVD', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Entertainment', 'starting', 'tomorrow', 'July', '3rd', 'rated', 'R', 'strong', 'bloody', 'violence', 'language', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'presentation', '1.78:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Dolby', 'Surround', '5.1', 'sound', 'approximately', '97', 'minutes', 'long']",Some Guy Who Kills People

1539096,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B007VYEDHO,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[1, 1]","Coming up with an original concept for a slasher film these days is an impossibility. So what can a budding filmmaker with an itch for violent deaths and twist endings do to make his project stand out from the rest of the ""Scream"" clones? Director Jack Perez decided to meld his gore-fest with a tween coming-of-age story. The result is a rather unique indie-flavored little film entitled ""Some Guy Who Kills People.""Ken Boyd (Kevin Corrigan) is fresh out of a mental institute. He's trying to put his grim past behind him, but the kids who sent him to the loony bin still enjoy tormenting him. Ken's best friend (Leo Fitzpatrick) gets him a job at the local ice cream shop. He soon begins a relationship with an English girl (Lucy Davis) new to town. At the same time, he finds out he has a daughter (Ariel Gade). Things get even more complex when the guys who picked on Ken start turning up brutally murdered.This movie works on every level. Anyone picked on in school will relate to Ken and his daughter's plight. At the same time, those with an appetite for bloodshed will thoroughly enjoy the graphic kill scenes. The film is a well-balanced mix of heart-on-your-sleeve indie flare and legitimate slasher gore.Kevin Corrigan portrays Ken Boyd as an emotionally repressed comic book artist who keeps his feelings bottled up inside... supposedly. Karen Black plays Ken's mother, who constantly patronizes him for being withdrawn. Barry Bostwick is perfect as the sheriff of the small town who dates Ken's mother and begins to suspect he's taking his aggressions out on his high school adversaries. All the actors put forth their best efforts and take the material seriously.From what I could tell all the special effects were practical. Every knife through the skull and severed head took me back to the wonderful days of the classic 1980s maniac killer flicks I stayed up late and watched during summer vacation. It's always nice to see a movie using old-school prosthetics and gore versus the CGI we've become so used to.Special features for the movie include a ""Making of"" featurette. It also contains the disturbingly amusing short, ""The Fifth,"" which inspired the full-length. Commentary by director Jack Perez and writer / producer Ryan Levin is included. It's all topped off by a trailer for the film.""Some Guy Who Kills People"" is a challenging and somehow touching slasher film. Its unique take and blending of two genres on the opposite ends of the movie spectrum make for an entertaining experience.

This movie proves he has the chops for it, though.The film follows Ken Boyd (Corrigan), a wanna-be artist who is fresh out of a mental institution. Now living with his mother (a delightful Karen Black, although her character gets a little annoying near the end of the film), Ken sullenly scoops ice cream at a local diner and tries not to hate his life too much. Accompanied by his well-meaning, self-proclaimed loser friend, Irv (Leo Fitzpatrick), Ken must deal with locals who mock him for his past, as well as a prodigal daughter, Amy, who returns to complicate his life with her precociousness. Meanwhile, some guy who kills people is viciously murdering all of Ken's old enemies.Amy is played nearly perfectly by the young Ariel Gade, and Corrigan turns in a remarkably subtle performance as the tormented artist who can barely mask his fear of and longing for regular society. Lucy Davis (of the UK The Office) plays a wide-eyed love interest, and Barry Bostwick does an excellent job as the spacey sheriff who is perhaps a little sharper than he seems.The script and acting are all top-notch, although the flick is obviously low-budget, which is most evident in some of the death scenes. In fact, the only reason I don't give the movie a full five stars is because the climax is clumsily choreographed and edited, making it seem rushed and awkward.

The humour is mostly in the asides, such as when Ronald - the goody-two shoes religious boyfriend of the young leading lady's mother - says in a creepy, robotic monotone, ""Lord, please send someone to aid this precious child and steer her down a righteous path Amen."" while leaving the eleven year-old stabbing at some horrible TV dinner to go to a bible study group.Barry Bostwick as the town sheriff is hilarious in several sight gags where you can't help but laugh. Karen Black is predictably creepy as the 34 year-old protagonist's (Kevin Corrigan) long-suffering mother - and so funny, too.Somehow all the madness in this weird psycho-cosmos works its way through to a satisfactory end and everything is right again in the world.No CG effects plus all real-time physical gags and lines make this quite a funny movie.Not really a horror movie whatsoever but as a comedy Some Guy Who Kills People has some killer moments.Now, let's give it the proper treatment that it deserves: add some subtitles and bump it up to a Blu-ray version.",4,Laugh Out Loud Dark Comic Snarkiness!,1341360000,"07 4, 2012",2012,1562,"['POSSIBLE', 'MILD', 'SPOILERS', 'horror', 'enthusiast', 'like', 'see', 'how', 'scared', 'movie', 'can', 'make', 'feel.Some', 'Guy', 'Who', 'Kills', 'Peopleis', 'not', 'kind', 'movie.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'appreciated', 'Horror/Comedy', 'movies', 'very', 'much', 'preferring', 'keep', 'genres', 'separate', 'Guy', 'who', 'Kills', 'People', 'funniest', 'lines', 'spoken', 'quirkiest', 'characters', 'Horror/Comedy', 'ouevre', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.The', 'filmmakers', 'managed', 'assemble', 'near-perfect', 'cast', 'social', 'retro-misfits', 'strange', 'very', 'Californian', 'alternate', ""'50"", 'universe', 'humour', 'mostly', 'asides', 'such', 'when', 'Ronald', 'goody-two', 'shoes', 'religious', 'boyfriend', 'young', 'leading', 'lady', 'mother', 'creepy', 'robotic', 'monotone', 'Lord', 'please', 'send', 'someone', 'aid', 'precious', 'child', 'steer', 'down', 'righteous', 'path', 'Amen', 'leaving', 'eleven', 'year-old', 'stabbing', 'horrible', 'TV', 'dinner', 'go', 'bible', 'study', 'group.Barry', 'Bostwick', 'town', 'sheriff', 'hilarious', 'several', 'sight', 'gags', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'Karen', 'Black', 'predictably', 'creepy', '34', 'year-old', 'protagonist', 'Kevin', 'Corrigan', 'long-suffering', 'mother', 'so', 'funny', 'too.Somehow', 'madness', 'weird', 'psycho-cosmos', 'way', 'satisfactory', 'end', 'everything', 'right', 'again', 'world.No', 'CG', 'effects', 'real-time', 'physical', 'gags', 'lines', 'make', 'quite', 'funny', 'movie.Not', 'really', 'horror', 'movie', 'whatsoever', 'comedy', 'Guy', 'Who', 'Kills', 'People', 'killer', 'moments.Now', 'let', 'give', 'proper', 'treatment', 'add', 'subtitles', 'bump', 'up', 'Blu-ray', 'version']",Some Guy Who Kills People

Credit to director Jack Perez and the screenwriter, whose name eludes me (sorry) for their innovative approach to a crowded genre.Kevin Corrigan has a rare leading role as Kenny, a much maligned man who wants revenge on the bullies who humiliated him in high school, resulting in his admission to a mental institution.  Enter young 11-year old Ariel Gade as the daughter he didn't know existed, and who wants to know her dad.  Add to the mix Barry Bostwick as the sardonic Sheriff, Karen Black as Corrigan's acerbic mama, Leo Fitzpatrick as the loyal best friend and Lucy Davis, the perky Brit cutie enamored with Corrigan.The film has some great comic lines and displays a lot of genuine heart in its troubled relationships.  Corrigan is excellent as the wounded Kenny..we really feel for him.  Gade is a revelation as the little girl, eschewing the usual bratty know-it-all.  Fitzpatrick and Davis are also quite good.  Bostwick and Black give their best performances in years and look like they are having a great time to boot!SOME GUY is a refreshing departure from stupid teenage slasher and torture flicks, gory but not overdone, and it's not a reboot or remake.

Next to his expressive mother whom hilariously abhors every move he makes, his mind is his own worst enemy and he sinks into a resentful and destructive mental place until ejected from his undignified reality by some unexpected newcomers to his life, but can love win-over his his antisocial mind and frosty heart?In my opinion, Some Guy Who Kills People is the darling of 2000s horror.  It seamlessly draws 80s horror sensibilities into the modern era without being self-aware, ridiculous, or predictable.  The characters are original, the physical comedy is practical and hilarious, and the story is as suspenseful and dramatic as it is fun.  I saw it at The Boston Underground Film Festival and found myself wanting to cheer out loud because we can all relate to the self-loathing that comes from eras when our existence seems futile.  Beyond the storyline, the secondary characters push this film to new heights with the oddly inquisitive and self-indulgent sheriff, mother whom says the things our own mother's looks make us feel, and much more!
