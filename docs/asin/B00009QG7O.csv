You'll want to watch it if you've seen the original (which is a great film in itself) but don't keep your hopes up high as this remake really falls short.The DVD really has no extras so far from what I can tell except for some trailers on other movies such as &quot;The Howling&quot; and &quot;The Fog&quot;. Amazon states that this DVD has &quot;TV spots&quot; on the DVD but I have yet to find them which means that there aren't any TV spots on the disc or they're hidden.The picture quality isn't all that great though considering this was made for TV I guess I'll let it slide. This is a bare bones disc that only fans of the remake will probably buy. I only bought it because I love the original movie and that this version has never been played in Australia (to my understanding). I'm not sure if it ever would have gotten played here in Australia.

Just recently King himself asked 'Why remake it? The first one was so good.' The theatrics were way over the top and I know this was suppose to be a closer adaption of King's book but the acting was so bad I couldn't even begin to care. Watching Sissy Spacek's Carrie was so sad. I cared about her character. I pitied her. I felt nothing for any of these characters especially Billy who mostly just gave people a detached cold stare. The Shining was remade and it was done very well. This was not. When are studios going to realize that some movie classics are best left alone? The day they remake Gone With The Wind will be sad indeed and I wouldn't be surprised to see them do it.Instead of remaking every great movie why not say to the younger generation to look back and watch these films. You know, before most if not all horror movies contained obscene amounts of gore and torture. Let them see movies can be and are great without all that stuff? Why not instead of remaking all these great horror classics give us some new stories to watch? Yet I suppose its the money that usually wins.

757103,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B00009QG7O,Erik North,"[1, 3]","Like a good number of remakes of classic movies, especially in the horror genre, the 2002 NBC-TV remaking of CARRIE is a problematic film.  The basic allure of Stephen King's first novel, which touches on religious fanaticism, high school fascism, and telekinesis, is as relevant now as it was in 1976, when Brian DePalma's film was released.  Even a good premise, however, can be derailed by mediocre execution, as was the case in the TV remake of THE SHINING or in the 1999 ""sequel"" THE RAGE: CARRIE 2.Angela Bettis does a good enough job as the tormented Carrie White.  Given that she has some pretty big shoes to fill, namely those of Sissy Spacek who had received an Oscar nod for the role in 1976, I think Bettis does better than most.  Patricia Clarkson is fair as the unglued Margaret White, although her low-key insanity still might make one pine for Piper Laurie's extremist performance in the first film.But for me, what undid this film were not only the many politically correct cosmetic changes to the identities of her torturing classmates (the Sue Snell character is African-American here), but the fact that the bucket of blood scene is poorly done.  When it's poured on Bettis, it just looks like what it is--red syrup.  In the original, when the blood hits Spacek, it slams into her like a tidal wave (thanks to DePalma's slow motion), creating such an emotional impact that caused that film to transcend the mere boundaries of horror.The CARRIE remake is thus forever in the shadow of the original, even as Bettis' performance stands on its own.  It is an okay film, even for TV; but for a true combination of horror and drama, the 1976 original is still the one to watch.",3,Problematic Remake Of A 1976 Horror Masterpiece,1076630400,"02 13, 2004",2004,1691,"['good', 'number', 'remakes', 'classic', 'movies', 'especially', 'horror', 'genre', '2002', 'NBC-TV', 'remaking', 'CARRIE', 'problematic', 'film', 'basic', 'allure', 'Stephen', 'King', 'first', 'novel', 'religious', 'fanaticism', 'high', 'school', 'fascism', 'telekinesis', 'relevant', 'now', 'was', '1976', 'when', 'Brian', 'DePalma', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'Even', 'good', 'premise', 'however', 'can', 'be', 'derailed', 'mediocre', 'execution', 'was', 'case', 'TV', 'remake', 'THE', 'SHINING', '1999', 'sequel', 'RAGE', 'CARRIE', '2.Angela', 'Bettis', 'good', 'enough', 'job', 'tormented', 'Carrie', 'White', 'Given', 'pretty', 'big', 'shoes', 'fill', 'namely', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'who', 'had', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'role', '1976', 'think', 'Bettis', 'better', 'most', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'fair', 'unglued', 'Margaret', 'White', 'low-key', 'insanity', 'still', 'might', 'make', 'one', 'pine', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'extremist', 'performance', 'first', 'film.But', 'what', 'undid', 'film', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'many', 'politically', 'correct', 'cosmetic', 'changes', 'identities', 'torturing', 'classmates', 'Sue', 'Snell', 'character', 'African-American', 'here', 'fact', 'bucket', 'blood', 'scene', 'poorly', 'done', 'When', 'poured', 'Bettis', 'just', 'what', 'red', 'syrup', 'original', 'when', 'blood', 'hits', 'Spacek', 'tidal', 'wave', 'thanks', 'DePalma', 'slow', 'motion', 'creating', 'such', 'emotional', 'impact', 'caused', 'film', 'transcend', 'mere', 'boundaries', 'horror.The', 'CARRIE', 'remake', 'thus', 'forever', 'shadow', 'original', 'even', 'Bettis', 'performance', 'own', 'okay', 'film', 'even', 'TV', 'true', 'combination', 'horror', 'drama', '1976', 'original', 'still', 'one', 'watch']",N/A
757104,A23JNLBAE18XO0,B00009QG7O,Frank R. Schoonover,"[0, 0]","This 2002 made for TV adaption of King's bestselling novel is the second adaption of King's novel and also a re-imagining at the same time. This film stays a lot more true and faithful to the novel than the 1976 feature film adaption (see review).The whole movie is centered on the local police investigation of what happened on prom night at Ewen High School. The police interview students who were at or not at the prom. As the police interview the students and later on, the gym teacher, we watched the story unfold as we watch the events leading up to prom night. The girls are playing softball in gym class and when it is all over, we see them head for the girl's locker room to shower and change clothes. Carrie (Angela Bettis) showers alone and is scared when she sees blood and fears that she is dying while the girls taunt her by shouting repeatedly ""Period!"" to her and the gym teacher Miss Desjardan (Rena Sofer) intervenes and she is sent home. Carrie then faces her religiously fanatical and legalistic mother (Patricia Clarkson) and is forced into a prayer closet and not let out until her mother feels that she is truly sorry for supposedly sinning when she had her first menstruation experience. Later on, as the girls are getting ready for gym, Miss Desjardan shows how angry she is with the girls that she decides to punish them by having them do intense physical fitness in the gym everyday, with only Chris Hargensen (Emilie De Ravin) deciding that she won't cooperate and as a result of that, she is suspended and banned from the upcoming senior prom. Carrie researches telekinetics and other sorts of strange phenoma in the school's library because she really can't understand why she has this power and what she can do about it. Later on, Sue Snell (Kandyse McClure) talks her boyfriend Tommy Ross (Tobias Mehler) into taking Carrie White to the upcoming senior prom out of remorse for participating in the locker room ruckus with the other girls. At first, Tommy is reluctant thinking that it is a totally mean joke and that Carrie will see right through it, but subsequently agrees to do it. Tommy later asks Carrie, who initially refuses thinking that she is being tricked and after some nice persuasion by Tommy, Carrie accepts, which leads to her telling her mother that she was invited and that she is going despite her mother's objections. Carrie shows that her mother's reign over her is over and that she is going and that her mother can't stop her and that is that. Chris later asks her boyfriend Billy Nolan (Jesse Cadotte) to help her play a prank on Carrie White and when Chris later hears through her girlfriend Tina (Katharine Isabelle) that Tommy Ross is taking Carrie White to the prom by showing her a ballot with Tommy and Carrie on it, they decide to go to a pig farm to slaughter a pig for it's blood as part of the prank, with Jackie Talbot (Malcolm Scott) and Kenny Garson (Miles Meadows) also in on the prank. As they arrive at the prom, everyone is shocked to see Carrie walk in with Tommy and the first to come to them is Helen (Chelan Simmons) and Roy (Steve Byers) who compliments her on her dress and they start to talk and get along. They are also approached by Norma (Meghan Black) who sees that Carrie is glowing with enthusiasm. After a confrontation by Miss Desjardin, Tommy and Carrie share in a slow dance and are surprised when they are elected king and queen of the senior prom. Not too long after this happens, Chris and Billy dump the pig's blood on Carrie and the whole crowd is shocked by this happening and when Kenny starts shouting taunts in the form of pig calls, Carrie has a mental breakdown and hears imaginary laughter in her mind and this unleashes her telekinetic powers and all H-E-Double Hockey Sticks breaks loose on everyone at the prom. The frightened prom night goers run everyplace around the gym, but find no way out. Carrie starts leaving the gym and as soon as she leaves the school, which starts to crumble as she leaves as a result of the electrical fire that was started when the electrical mechanisms malfunctioned, Carrie leaves mountains of destruction as she continues to walk home in a telekinetic trance and inadvertently gets even with Billy and Chris by making their vehicle smash and crash into a pole. The town becomes a disaster area as Carrie leaves destruction and death where she walks. I won't give too much away as I don't want to spoil it for those of you who haven't seen it yet.David Carson does a terrific auspicious job as the director of this 2002 adaption of King's bestselling novel. Bryan Fuller also wrote a great teleplay for this film. The special effects are realistic and well done. The film is also very well acted for a TV movie as Angela Bettis plays Carrie White brilliantly and Patricia Clarkson portrays Carrie's mother with unholy relish. The rest of the cast also portray their roles in the film wonderfully. Each and everything about this film is great. It is an edge of the seat thrill ride when the mayhem really starts and once it has you in it's grip, it won't let you go until the bitter end. It is a scary and frightening film that sends chills up the spine.We get to see the story unfold as the police detective talks with several students and a faculty member about prom night and what had happened that night with a lot of unanswered questions.I watched this made for TV adaption when it premiered on the NBC network in November of 2002. Before I did, I re-read King's novel and when I watched the film soon after, I saw that this was a more faithful adaption of the novel than the initial 1976 adaption. I also felt that it was a much better adaption as well as the best adaption of the novel. It stays true to the novel and leaves you wondering what will happen next as you watch it. I actually enjoyed this adaption and I still enjoy it. It happens to be my favorite adaption of the bestselling novel. I still enjoy the original 1976 adaption, but this particular adaption will always be my favorite of all three, as the novel was later adapted and re-imagined again in 2013.The DVD has nothing in regards to special features. The only things that we get is the preview trailer for this particular adaption and a few other preview trailers of other MGM released horror films. We also get a recommendation page of other MGM release horror DVD's. The movie still looks as colorful and fresh as the day that the film premiered on NBC in November of 2002. It was also meant to be a pilot for a TV series about Carrie, but was later scrapped. I bought my copy used from a local DVD rental store that was going out of business.I still enjoy this particular version and I have watched it several times since owning it.If you have a taste for horror, this 2002 adaption of Carrie is for you. It delivers all the goods that you'd expect in a horror film and it also will frighten and scare you. No fan of horror should pass this one up nor forget to add to their personal DVD library's. It is truly a treat for any fan of horror films.",5,The Best Adaption of King's Novel,1398211200,"04 23, 2014",2014,7065,"['2002', 'made', 'TV', 'adaption', 'King', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'second',

Patricia Clarkson's take on Margaret White was so underplayed, that memories of Piper Laurie's hystrionics in the film were sorely missed.  The &quot;tagged-on&quot; ending defeated the purpose of the whole tragedy of Carrie White(why? So a television series could possibly follow?).

This version won't achieve the same reputation, but it's worth seeing, and I don't have any regrets about buying it.

As others have also mentioned, Patricia Clarkson is notable for her subdued but no less scary interpretation of Carrie's mother.  And, in addition to the fact that the frequent nods toward the original film are mostly well done and add to the movie's effectiveness, it's also nice to see some of the material from the book represented that was omitted from De Palma's movie.  Weaknesses include some poor acting from a few of the minor characters; the cheap, basic cable look of the photography and special effects; tidbits of poorly written, ""updated"" language; and the silly twist-ending that has no impact and is entirely forgettable.

757114,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B00009QG7O,Joker,"[1, 1]","For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this movie...Carrie (2002) is a remake of the original 1976 movie starring Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, Betty Buckley, and John Travolta.  Sure, this remake is a faithful adaptation of the Stephen King novel, but if you want to watch the far superior movie, then see the 1976 movie.  The problem with this 2002 remake is that it falls short of the original on every level.  It just doesn't have the same magic and chemistry of the original.  Some of the characters are sort of bland.  Angela Bettis, however, gives a pretty good performance as Carrie White, but Sissy Spacek IS Carrie White.  Everything seems to be waaaaaaaaay overdone as well.  The nightmarish prom scene drags on too long and is just so over the top.  Also, the musical score isn't as good as the original.

Though I enjoyed the original film that was made by Brian DePalma, whom I always felt was a modern-day Hitchcock. I also enjoyed this new movie about Carrie.  Movies have been remade since their invention.  And why not?  I like watching how other directors handle the source material.  This new take on the novel was very good and very close to the novel except for the ending--which I didn't mind. The direction and camera work in the new Carrie is refreshing, real, and very atmospheric.  The hazy light in study hall, the greenness of the institutional lights in the interview room, the shadows and light in Carrie's house, the surreal use of blue-screen backgrounds all contribute to make this film play like an odd bad dream.  Angela Bettis was remarkable in her portrayal of Carrie.  Many folks complained that the other characters were played all wrong--well, that is wrong!  And you would know that if you read the novel.  Far more improved on the original was the relationship between Chris and Billy.  The acting in this movie is excellent and the young cast is very talented.  Being a miniseries, there was more time to flesh out characters and actually do the some of the scenes that DePalma wanted to do back in the 70's but couldn't do to time constrants and hasseling from the studio.  I bought this DVD and I have it next to the DePalma movie on the shelf.  My only complaint is that there were no extra features other than ads for upcoming movies.  I even liked the music.

This movie is a total mess, and a reminder that they need to stop tampering with classics. The original Carrie with Sissy Spacek was awesome, but this remake is just plain garbage to be blunt about it. This movie really deserves no stars to tell you the truth. I'm not really concerning myself with the book, but I do know the original Carrie inside out, and if you're gonna remake that then you could at least do it right. I understand that it was only a T.V movie, but that's all the more reason they should've left it alone. Those cheesy special effects were just dreadful, and them having Carrie walking down the street terrorizing the whole town was definitely NOT! a nice touch. Please, they had this girl walking through the town throwing around and burning down everything. That's some telekenesis HUH!. That was way over the top, and Carrie didn't do all that in the original because she was in a trance, or some state of shock. Another thing is that Carrie's mother was not that memorable in this one. In fact, I have no idea who played her character at all because this movie was full of unknown people. However, Carrie's mother in the original seemed more deranged which was kinda terrifying in it's own right I think. You can't take a movie that's already been made like 20 years ago, wreck the story, and then say it's more like the book. If that's the way it was intended to be they would have made it like that the first time. This movie is a poor excuse for a remake to me. On top of that, Angela Bettis really needs to be stopped because I just watched that horrible movie ""May"" that she also was in, and I have to say that was crap too. The most they did in reference to the old classic was use some of the lines from the script, but other than that I hated the rest. I'm still in such disbelief at how they destroyed this movie. Carrie actually was alive at the end and riding down the highway to another state, and we all know Sissy Spacek didn't make it. I could bash this movie all night long, but the last thing I will say is the next time someone gets the bright idea to make a horror classic into a made for T.V movie, someone really should tell that person to think again.",1,THIS MOVIE IS A DISASTER!,1099180800,"10 31, 2004",2004,2306,"['just', 'wan', 'was', 'everyone', 'else', 'watching', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'same', 'thing', 'was', 'looking', 'movie', 'total', 'mess', 'reminder', 'need', 'stop', 'tampering', 'classics', 'original', 'Carrie', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'was', 'awesome', 'remake', 'just', 'plain', 'garbage', 'be', 'blunt', 'movie', 'really', 'stars', 'tell', 'truth', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'concerning', 'book', 'do', 'know', 'original', 'Carrie', 'out', ""'re"", 'gon', 'remake', 'then', 'could', 'least', 'do', 'right', 'understand', 'was', 'only', 'T.V', 'movie', 'more', 'reason', 'should', ""'ve"", 'left', 'alone', 'cheesy', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'just', 'dreadful', 'having', 'Carrie', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'terrorizing', 'whole', 'town', 'was', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'nice', 'touch', 'Please', 'had', 'girl', 'walking', 'town', 'throwing', 'around', 'burning', 'down', 'everything', 'telekenesis', 'HUH', 'was', 'way', 'top', 'Carrie', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'original', 'was', 'trance', 'state', 'shock', 'thing', 'Carrie', 'mother', 'was', 'not', 'memorable', 'one', 'fact', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'played', 'character', 'movie', 'was', 'full', 'unknown', 'people', 'However', 'Carrie', 'mother', 'original', 'seemed', 'more', 'deranged', 'was', 'kinda', 'terrifying', 'own', 'right', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'movie', 'already', 'been', 'made', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'wreck', 'story', 'then', 'say', 'more', 'book', 'way', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'first', 'time', 'movie', 'poor', 'excuse', 'remake', 'top', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'really', 'be', 'stopped', 'just', 'watched', 'horrible', 'movie', 'May', 'also', 'was', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'crap', 'too', 'most', 'did', 'reference', 'old', 'classic', 'was', 'lines', 'script', 'other', 'hated', 'rest', ""'m"", 'still', 'such', 'disbelief', 'how', 'destroyed', 'movie', 'Carrie', 'actually', 'was', 'alive', 'end', 'riding', 'down', 'highway', 'state', 'know', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'could', 'bash', 'movie', 'night', 'long', 'last', 'thing', 'will', 'say', 'next', 'time', 'someone', 'bright', 'idea', 'make', 'horror', 'classic', 'made', 'T.V', 'movie', 'someone', 'really', 'should', 'tell', 'person', 'think', 'again']",N/A

The first Carrie made starred Sissy Spacek and she did an excellent job playing the role of Carrie and I often wish she could have been in this one! However the newer actress(Angela Bettis) does do a remarkable job. It is nice to see that the woman playing Carries mother in the remake was not as crazy as the one in the first. In the first Carrie, Carries mother (played by actress Piper Laurie) kinda went overboard with the whole dying thing. She looked more like she was doing something else but I decline to actually write what that looked like in a review. Lets just say, it didn't look right with the rest of the movie in the first movie. In the second movie that scene wasn't even in it and it is a lot more tasteful and somewhat closer to the book. In the remake, Carries mother dies of a heart attack rather than a stabbing, a better touch I thought.  The new actresses are really good! It has a nice touch adding the police investigation to it I thought and this is just overall a better version of the movie. There are some scenes to the movie that make this a much better film.

It's inevitable to think of Brian DePalma's original scarefest with the Oscar nominated Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie; but if we take this made for TV movie on its own merits and try not to compare it, we may find it's a pretty good movie.  Angela Bettis is mesmerizing as Carrie White, the daughter of a religious fanatic, who made it rain rocks when she was born and also when she got angry as a child.  We obviously know this little girl is something out of the ordinary.  But Stephen King's CARRIE really focuses on the loneliness of being different; of being mocked because you aren't like everyone else; the joy of being accepted at a prom with the handsome hunk Tommy; and ultimately, the irony of revenge on everyone whether they deserved it or not.  The production values for a tv movie are very good, even if some of the CGI effects look a little forced, but director David Carson gives us the portrait of a lonely girl who just wants to fit in, and whose retaliation on a sad bunch of spoiled brats is carried to the extreme.  Patricia Clarkson's understated performance as Margaret White is just as chilling as the over the top fanaticism of Piper Laurie; Tobias Mehler is a likeable and hunky Tommy; Rena Sofer brings a lot of punch to her role as the gym teacher; Katherine Isabelle (Ginger Snaps) is a bitchy Tina, and the young lady who plays Chris (didn't catch her name, but she's currently on the hit series LOST) is also effectively sinister.  Kandyce McClure seems slightly out of place as Sue Snell, and I'm not sure the addition of the police investigation (led by the sturdy David Keith) is necessary.  I also felt the ending paled in comparison to the original (Mama being impaled by knives in a mock effigy of the horrible crucifix she had).  Seems like the writer wanted to shy away from doing the same ending, but didnt come up with one as memorable.All in all, though, Bettis is magnificent as Carrie, and Sissy Spacek should be proud of her.",4,LET'S PRETEND THIS IS NOT A REMAKE...,1107216000,"02 1, 2005",2005,1998,"['..and', 'take', 'own', 'inevitable', 'think', 'Brian', 'DePalma', 'original', 'scarefest', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'take', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'own', 'merits', 'try', 'not', 'compare', 'may', 'find', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'mesmerizing', 'Carrie', 'White', 'daughter', 'religious', 'fanatic', 'who', 'made', 'rain', 'rocks', 'when', 'was', 'born', 'also', 'when', 'got', 'angry', 'child', 'obviously', 'know', 'little', 'girl', 'something', 'ordinary', 'Stephen', 'King', 'CARRIE', 'really', 'loneliness', 'being', 'different', 'being', 'mocked', 'are', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'else', 'joy', 'being', 'accepted', 'prom', 'handsome', 'hunk', 'Tommy', 'ultimately', 'irony', 'revenge', 'everyone', 'deserved', 'not', 'production', 'values', 'tv', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'even', 'CGI', 'effects', 'look', 'little', 'forced', 'director', 'David', 'Carson', 'portrait', 'lonely', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'fit', 'retaliation', 'sad', 'bunch', 'spoiled', 'brats', 'carried', 'extreme', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'understated', 'performance', 'Margaret', 'White', 'just', 'as', 'chilling', 'top', 'fanaticism', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'Tobias', 'Mehler', 'likeable', 'hunky', 'Tommy', 'Rena', 'Sofer', 'lot', 'punch', 'role', 'gym', 'teacher', 'Katherine', 'Isabelle', 'Ginger', 'Snaps', 'bitchy', 'Tina', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'Chris', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'name', 'currently', 'hit', 'series', 'LOST', 'also', 'effectively', 'sinister', 'Kandyce', 'McClure', 'slightly', 'place', 'Sue', 'Snell', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'addition', 'police', 'investigation', 'led', 'sturdy', 'David', 'Keith', 'necessary', 'also', 'felt', 'ending', 'paled', 'comparison', 'original', 'Mama', 'being', 'impaled', 'knives', 'mock', 'effigy', 'horrible', 'crucifix', 'had', 'writer', 'wanted', 'shy', 'away', 'doing', 'same', 'ending', 'come', 'up', 'one', 'memorable.All', 'Bettis', 'magnificent', 'Carrie', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'should', 'be', 'proud']",N/A

757127,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00009QG7O,Only-A-Child,"[2, 3]","Like ""Dawn of the Dead"", the original ""Carrie"" story is so good that generally faithful remakes like this are still entertaining even if they are not equal to the original De Palma film. And ""film"" is an important word in this particular case because this Canadian remake was shot on digital video instead of film. Each year video technology gets closer to reproducing the look of film but in 2002 it still had a long way to go. Video has a sharper more realistic look than film and a much lower contrast ratio, making it appropriate for documentary and historical films but not so good for expressionistic stuff or stylistic horror films in the Hitchcock and Argento tradition. This could have been a fatal flaw had the remake of ""Carrie"" been a theatrical release or even if it had been introduced to a world of high definition big screen televisions. But most 2002 viewers watched this thing on 19-inch standard definition televisions where these differences are barely detectable.Both the original and the remake stay ""generally"" faithful to the Stephen King novel so long-time fans will have little to cringe about. On the plus side, the remake does a good job of creating some destruction in the town, something that De Palma could not do for budgetary reasons. On the minus side, the original ending is altered (extended) in a totally contrived way to keep things open for a future television series (maybe Carrie finds her ""Tru Calling"") for which the producers ultimately could not find adequate financing.Angela Bettis' ""Carrie"" is virtually identical to the Sissy Spacek version. Her performance is at least as good and probably better but the entire supporting cast is so much weaker that it is hard to judge. Bettis is clearly too old for the role but so is everyone playing her high school classmates so it is not a glaring problem. As Carrie's mother, Patricia Clarkson is a poor substitute for Piper Laurie. This is no surprise since Laurie's performance was the best thing about the original but Clarkson's repressed version of the character takes away from the sympathy factor Bettis is going for. The two of them, however, are responsible for the remake's best moment as Carrie mentally slides her mother out of the bedroom and slams the door after her, but not before she warns her to be careful about keeping her fingers away from the slamming the door.It is a matter of personal choice about whether it is best to watch Bettis' incredible performance in ""May"" before or after viewing ""Carrie"". She plays a similar character in ""May"" (including the sewing skills) but the supporting cast and the directing is so much better, making May a more believable, sympathetic, and terrifying character. But Bettis has one truly extraordinary scene in ""Carrie"", watch for the cosmetics scene in the drug store midway into the film.  The camera stays tight on her face for several minutes and the emotional range she cycles through renders any dialogue unnecessary.  She turns a very ordinary sequence into something truly special.The DVD release of the Carrie remake would have benefited from some serious trimming. They needed a lot of padding to get up to a 2 Hour 12 Minute running length (for a three hour television broadcast) and the DVD authors did not even bother to edit out the fades in and out for the many commercials. There are several useless sequences like ten minutes at the local pig farm.  Better to have used the time to put some dimensionality into the main villains; the really popular kids do not have the time or the interest to harass classmates at the absolute bottom of the pecking order.  King's weakness has traditionally been a failure to adequately explain the motivations driving his villains and the remake had time to address this issue.The main device for upping the running time was the addition of a post-prom police investigation headed by David Keith in a rather nothing performance. This serves to introduce the real story in a series of linearly told flashbacks and therefore could not be carved out of a re-cut version.Then again, what do I know?

And for me this re-make was highly anticipated! It was all I could think about since I had seen the previews on TV and it lived up to my expectations, which were high, but I knew it wouldn't surpass the origional! Well, it basically is a mirror image of the first but it follows the book more closely! And I love the book aswell. Well Carrie is a social outcast with a Jesus freak as a mother ( I mean no disrespect in that I am a Christian myself ) and Carrie has telekinisis the ability to move objects with the mind. So, she has her first period in the locker room one day and everyone makes fun of her and fills her locker with tampons and they are just very cruel to her. And it is clearly noticible that this is an updated re-make with talk of Freddie Prinze Jr. movies and the songs, that this is modern day rather than taking place back in 1976. So of course sex is brought up a few times and rumors that Sue and Carrie are in a lesbian relationship and stupid things like that that could have been left out and still the movie would have been good. And I like the feel of this movie more than I do the origional, the color I like better, but the way it was filmed is odd, it's like someone was holding the camera the whole time and never put it on a solid holder, cuz the camera is always moving and at times it can get frustrating. But the music is good and so is the acting, except from Carries mom, she could have been a lot more agressive like Piper Laurie in the origional. But everything was good and Carries rampage over the school and town was very realistic and very good looking. I only have a problem with the ending. SO stupid and completely different from the 76 versiona nd I hated the end!!! That was what gave it my **** rating! But it is still a very good re-make! They did the right thing by putting it on TV cuz it wouldn't have done very good at the box office! I'm glad they decided to put it on DVD and VHS!

Recently there was a remake of it starring Chloe Moretz, and it's equally good. However, there is another remake of Carrie that was made for tv in 2002 that some people may not know about. I don't love it like I do the original and newest version, but it is a lot truer to the book. For example, this has the police conducting interviews and asking people about the conspiracy to dump the pig's blood, it has the rain of stones, but most importantly it has the destruction of the town.Angela Bettis plays Carrie White this time. She's a pretty woman, She's a great actress (watch 'May') but her performance of Carrie just came off as awkward. Maybe that's the way she wanted to portray the character, but I think Sissy and Chloe were better. Emilie De Ravin made a good Miss Desjardin. She was very conniving and vicious. I liked Rena Sofer's performance as Miss Desjardin. She was more strict and more authoritative than Judy Greer in the 2013 remake. Patricia Clarkson was kinda bland as Margaret White. She wasn't as crazy as Piper Laurie, nor psychotic as Julianne Moore.Carrie White is a very shy girl who has no friends and a crazy religious mom who constantly locks her in the closet. When she gets her first period during gym class, all the girls humiliate her. This starts a chain of events when Carrie finds out she has telekinesis; the power to move objects with her mind. When Sue Snell feels bad for mocking Carrie, she asks her boyfriend, Tommy Ross to take Carrie to the prom.When Carrie is crowned Prom Queen, the bucket of pig's blood is poured and all hell breaks loose.

But when I saw several actors and actresses from the SyFy Channel I was a bit apprehensive.Carrie is a girl with budding telekinetic ability who lives with a crazy mom who punishes her and locks her in a prayer closet to pray.  Using religion as a punishment/drive tool is pretty bad but Carrie is even more introverted and practically catatonic when it comes to social intercourse among her fellow students.And they are a cruel bunch.  They despise her and do all manner of bullying.  When Carrie has her period in the gym shower, they come up to her and chant ""Period"", I'm sure with the best of intentions to let her know what's happening.  Not!Angela Bettis plays the socially frigid girl quite well.  And her insane mom really goes nuts when Carrie gets to go to the prom with Tommy, who was convinced to do so by his girlfriend Sue Snell (well known to Battlestar Galactica fans as Kandyse McClure).  Her motive is not really clear - looks  like a pity move to me.Spoiler:  The senior prom prank was really bad and set Carrie off on a destructive wave across the town as well as killing most of the students in the process - many deserved it, frankly.

I was surprised at how much I liked this movie. Angela Bettis portrays the awkward outcast, Carrie White and she plays the role phenominally. She's right up there with Sissy Spacek, the original Carrie. Because of the fact that CGI has become more common, the filmmakers stayed more true the novel which makes this movie good alone. Though the effects were something you'd see from a SyFy film (especially in the falling stones scene) it wasn't too distracting. The acting was really good, too, even the minor characters shined.

757140,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B00009QG7O,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[2, 3]","Stephen King's ""Carrie"" is among the top tier of horror novels ever written, but the 2002 remake version of the tale surpasses the original novel.  Not to mention soaring past the original filmed version from 1976, which was loaded with talent on both sides of the camera but just couldn't capture the tension or emotion of the novel.This is actually one that I only saw fairly recently.  With it being a made-for-network-tv movie, I always kind of assumed it was going to be 'horror-lite', like the style of theatrical movies that were so popular in the late 90s.  There were only a few of those I really got into, so the ""Carrie"" remake, while not something I was trying to avoid, was just never very high on my to-see list; I ended up renting it on a day when there were virtually no other horror movies in the video store I hadn't already seen.From the first few moments onward, it becomes clear that this isn't an ordinary tv movie or mini-series.  It's not on the light side either; either the DVD is extended or the backwards slide in what gets on tv hadn't really started in 2002.  With Angela Bettis giving a stunning, award-worthy performance in the title role, ""Carrie"" is a riveting, frightening, and visually awesome tour-de-force that strikes at the heart and mind in a way that I've seen very few made-for-tv movies do.  The story of ""Carrie"" is well-known but it's deeper and more affecting than can be conveyed in a few short words.  The dysfunctionally shy, lonely, and anguished - and secretly telekinetic - Carrie Whyte is scorned and tormented by her peers at school, and berated and shamed at home by a mother who's own interpretation of religion is so twisted up she makes the world's most conservative televangelists look like Marx-quoting happy-go-lucky hippies.  The question isn't If the repressed rage in Carrie is going to become too powerful for her to contain, but when and how.  And it's after her life starts to improve only to be plunged into an even deeper pit that it's likely to come out.The movie follows the book in operating in two timeframes - the bulk of the story going through in normal linear mode, with occasional flash-forwards into the future to show an ongoing investigation into catastrophic events that occured on Prom Night.  The climatic last twenty-five minutes is jaw-dropping, much better than the same period in the novel (the only significant flaw in the novel, I thought, was that the events of that night took a sudden drop in its climatic end chapters right when things should have been at their most mind-blowing).  The last twenty-five minutes have to be seen to be believed.  Another change is that the number of sympathetic characters has been upped a bit - and they've been made more credible - than in the book or the previous remake.  Despite those changes, it's very faithful to the spirit of King's novel - more than a lot of adaptations - but it's got the different hooks to make it feel so fresh.  Everyone involved in this did smashing work, and they've created an all-time great, far better than I ever anticipated.A horror essential, and every iota as great as the movie version of King's ""The Green Mile"".",5,"Beauty, Dark Torments, Dark Tragedy, And Dark Retribution",1174003200,"03 16, 2007",2007,3181,"['Stephen', 'King', 'Carrie', 'top', 'tier', 'horror', 'novels', 'ever', 'written', '2002', 'remake', 'version', 'tale', 'original', 'novel', 'Not', 'mention', 'soaring', 'original', 'filmed', 'version', '1976', 'was', 'loaded', 'talent', 'sides', 'camera', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'capture', 'tension', 'emotion', 'novel.This', 'actually', 'one', 'only', 'saw', 'fairly', 'recently', 'being', 'made-for-network-tv', 'movie', 'always', 'kind', 'assumed', 'was', 'going', 'be', ""'horror-lite"", 'style', 'theatrical', 'movies', 'were', 'so', 'popular', 'late', '90s', 'were', 'only', 'few', 'really', 'got', 'Carrie', 'remake', 'not', 'something', 'was', 'trying', 'avoid', 'was', 'just', 'never', 'very', 'high', 'to-see', 'list', 'ended', 'up', 'renting', 'day', 'when', 'were', 'virtually', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'video', 'store', 'had', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen.From', 'first', 'few', 'moments', 'onward', 'clear', ""n't"", 'ordinary', 'tv', 'movie', 'mini-series', 'not', 'light', 'side', 'DVD', 'extended', 'backwards', 'slide', 'what', 'tv', 'had', ""n't"", 'really', 'started', '2002', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'giving', 'stunning', 'award-worthy', 'performance', 'title', 'role', 'Carrie', 'riveting', 'frightening', 'visually', 'awesome', 'tour-de-force', 'heart', 'mind', 'way', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'few', 'made-for-tv', 'movies', 'do', 'story', 'Carrie', 'well-known', 'deeper', 'more', 'affecting', 'can', 'be', 'conveyed', 'few', 'short', 'words', 'dysfunctionally', 'shy', 'lonely', 'anguished', 'secretly', 'telekinetic', 'Carrie', 'Whyte', 'scorned', 'tormented', 'peers', 'school', 'berated', 'shamed', 'home', 'mother', 'who', 'own', 'interpretation', 'religion', 'so', 'twisted', 'world', 'most', 'conservative', 'televangelists', 'look', 'Marx-quoting', 'happy-go-lucky', 'hippies', 'question', ""n't"", 'repressed', 'rage', 'Carrie', 'going', 'become', 'too', 'powerful', 'contain', 'when', 'how', 'life', 'improve', 'only', 'be', 'plunged', 'even', 'deeper', 'pit', 'likely', 'come', 'out.The', 'movie', 'book', 'operating', 'two', 'timeframes', 'bulk', 'story', 'going', 'normal', 'linear', 'mode', 'occasional', 'flash-forwards', 'future', 'show', 'ongoing', 'investigation', 'catastrophic', 'events', 'occured', 'Prom', 'Night', 'climatic', 'last', 'twenty-five', 'minutes', 'jaw-dropping', 'much', 'better', 'same', 'period', 'novel', 'only', 'significant', 'flaw', 'novel', 'thought', 'was', 'events', 'night', 'took', 'sudden', 'drop', 'climatic', 'end', 'chapters', 'right', 'when', 'things', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'mind-blowing', 'last', 'twenty-five', 'minutes', 'have', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'change', 'number', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'been', 'upped', 'bit', ""'ve"", 'been', 'made', 'more', 'credible', 'book', 'previous', 'remake', 'changes', 'very', 'faithful', 'spirit', 'King', 'novel', 'more', 'lot', 'adaptations', 'got', 'different', 'hooks', 'make', 'feel', 'so', 'fresh', 'Everyone', 'involved', 'did', 'smashing', 'work', ""'ve"", 'created', 'all-time', 'great', 'far', 'better', 'ever', 'anticipated.A', 'horror', 'essential', 'iota', 'as', 'great', 'movie', 'version', 'King', 'Green', 'Mile']",N/A

757144,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,B00009QG7O,the masked reviewer,"[11, 16]","Certain movies are just so absolutely perfect that it would seem there is no point in a remake (other than greed). See the recent disasterous remakes of THE OMEN, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, THE FOG, THE STEPFORD WIVES, and 2007s HALLOWEEN. One can only anticipate with dread the inevitable remakes of THE EXORCIST, ROSEMARY'S BABY and JAWS.One of those perfect originals is Brian De Palma classic CARRIE. When I heard about this remake for NBC, I HAD to tune in as it promised to be a train wreck. Forget for a moment that the original is perfect in every way, lets just focus on the fact that the R-rated 1976 classic was made when an R rating in Hollywood could truly be an R-rating and that we were now going to see Stephen King's warning to High School Bullies transferred to the medium best known as ""You Can't Show That On Television!""The movie opens with Sue Snell being interrogated by the police. This framing device is close to King's novel but it doesn't exactly pan out, as we are often watching scenes that Sue couldn't possibly know anything about. We then have a pan across a classroom of girls that mirrors the camera move through the locker room that opens the previous version. There's some tepid harassment of Carrie, something else, and then we're on to the shower scene, with a repeat of the pan across the locker room. The footage of Carrie discovering her period is a virtual shot-for-shot recreation. It all follows quite closely [as with the first film] the book, although we get the first clue that this version is going to amp things up - when the shower lightbulb explodes with a ludicrous burst of sparks. (Everything here is amped-up, because lightbulbs that simply pop are no longer exciting enough, are they?) In this misguided remake, after the principal bungles Carrie's name to an almost retarded degree, she doesn't just flip an ashtray, she moves a huge desk 3 feet across the floor. Similarly, Later on while being taunted by an obnoxious neighbor kid, it's no longer enough to simply knock the kid off his bike, vicious Carrie X-treme sport jumps him into a tree. (Where is the restraint? Where is Carrie's vulnerability? Not to mention, that if you give too much away in the beginning, there's very little to get worked up over as the story progresses).The rest of the movie proceeds apace. It takes forever to develop the opening scenes, it skips nearly everything that made up the middle of the De Palma version, and with more than an hour to go, it's already prom night. This leaves out the girls' detention, Tommy and friends shopping for tuxedos, and the gym teacher's relationship with Carrie [in this version, Sue Snell helps her experiment with makeup]. This also leaves out a lot of the emotional resonance to each of these characters that the earlier movie had. There is ultimately no one left to care about and worse, to boo-hiss when they get their just desserts.Patricia Clarkson as Margaret White is perhaps the worst casting in a remake since Mia Farrow essayed the role of Mrs Blaylock in THE OMEN. I have never known Patricia Clarkson be mediocre in anything. I was forced to ammend my opinion after this. She just not threatening enough. She doesn't even really seem crazy! Sue Snell is now practically a model in the looks department. This also sadly seems to merit a commensurate drop in acting ability. Emilie de Ravin as Chris gets more time than in the DePalma version but she can't compete with the id-driven sex-vixen vindictiveness of Nancy Allen.There are a lot of moments where the dialogue matches the De Palma version word for word and at those times you really wish you were watching the original film.Before you know it we're at the prom, where many of the most beloved elements from the first film are sorely missed. Since we don't have much of an emotional connection to Carrie, we are not really involved in her struggle to overcome her fears and try to have a good time. For the same reason, we can have no sense that Tommy Ross may genuinely be falling for her. There is also no heartbreaking (and heart-stopping) slow-motion walk up to the stage after Carrie's name is called, pulled off so beautifully by Sissy Spacek in the original, and there certainly is no expertly choreographed and edited purely visual build-up to the dumping of the pigs blood, which is one of the most amazing parts of the De Palma film. There are a few references to it, and a few shots that mimic shots and sequences from the first film [including a CGI bucket of blood above the stage--what, it is now too difficult to film a bucket of blood?], and then, when the blood is dropped, about 24 gallons spews down for an unending amount of time... pretty amazing they could fit all that in that tiny bucket.Absolutely the best thing about this film is when it is finally over. (or at least you think it is) THEN, Sue Snell shows up and REVIVES CARRIE. That's right, CARRIE LIVES!!!! Carrie then GOES INCOGNITO in this crazy punk wig and skips town to start a new life! And you start to think ""What, is this going to be the start of a series? Yes, folks...this excruciatingly bad remake was meant to be the springboard for a weekly TV series and you just sat through a three hour failed TV pilot - (I have heard some bad notions in the past for weekly TV dramas -- but CARRIE???) That's a new low even for network television.As the Amazon editorial very aptly states, why would you waste your time with this hideous trash when you could better spend it with Sissy Spacek (Best Actress Oscar Nomination for her role) as well as John Travolta, William Katt, Piper Laurie (Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for Margaret White), Amy Irving, Betty Buckley (Also later terrific as Margaret White in the infamous 1988 Broadway Musical version) and the pitch perfect Nancy Allen. That one has it all. taut direction by Brian DePalma at the top of his game, great acting and one of the few terrific film versions of a Stephen King novel.

Angela Bettis does a wonderful job in her role, and I didn't really have any moments where I wished that Sissy Spacek was the actress. I actually think their performances are about even. I still think, however, that the 1976 film is superior because of the time period for the movie. In the 2002 movie, everything is upgraded to reflect the times we live in (Internet, cell phones, etc) which is a bit tacky. Also, this movie has a surprisingly weak ending. I thought the 1976 film had a weak and frustrating ending; it was nothing compared to the almost abrupt ending in this version. Still, this movie has some replay value, especially with those who want to compare the two movies.

Apparently DePalma et al ran out of money and goodbye last third of the book. But the end was also kind of silly. Hands sprouting from the grave-so overdone.Stephen King has sat through years of mediocre adaptations of his movies. This has been corrected the last few years with the TV remake. And this film was an especially good candidate.First the good parts. Angela Bettis (you may recall her as Kim Basinger's junkie sister from Bless the Child) is fantastic as Carrie. I like Sissy Spacek but she never really grabbed me in that part. Bettis really conveys Carrie's intelligence and promise while also projecting how close she is to snapping after years of torment. She really makes the movie the sympathetic tragedy that King intended. Ditto for Rena Sofer as the gym teacher who befriends her and Patricia Clarkson as her religious hysteric mother. Clarkson wisely underplays the role rather than re-launching Piper Laurie-style hysterics. This adaptation is much closer to the plot and spirit of the book.What's not so good is....daggone it, they changed the ending again. I won't spoil anything so enough said. See which one you prefer. Sue Snell is not as sympathetic as she was in the book. I can't tell if that is because Kandyse McClure is miscast or the way the part was written. A little of both I think. Ditto for Emilie de Ravin as Carrie' chief tormenter, Chris Jorgenson. She was bitchy and unlikable but I didn't get the sense she was capable of the stunt she pulls. Many of the special effects are obviously digital-certainly films with far higher budgets have had this problem (The Hulk, we're looking in your direction.) It's a USA TV movie though so good job all things considered.The plot is updated well (with references to Freddie Prinze and the internet.) If you enjoyed the book and are curious, this is worth a rental. You won't be disappointed over all. If you just loved the book more than life, maybe you should buy this.",3,Stephen King vindicated...sort of,1090368000,"07 21, 2004",2004,2083,"['ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'came', 'first-I', 'read', 'Carrie', 'saw', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'original', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'Apparently', 'DePalma', 'al', 'ran', 'money', 'goodbye', 'last', 'third', 'book', 'end', 'was', 'also', 'kind', 'silly', 'Hands', 'sprouting', 'grave-so', 'overdone.Stephen', 'King', 'sat', 'years', 'mediocre', 'adaptations', 'movies', 'been', 'corrected', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'TV', 'remake', 'film', 'was', 'especially', 'good', 'candidate.First', 'good', 'parts', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'may', 'recall', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'junkie', 'sister', 'Bless', 'Child', 'fantastic', 'Carrie', 'like', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'never', 'really', 'grabbed', 'part', 'Bettis', 'really', 'Carrie', 'intelligence', 'promise', 'also', 'projecting', 'how', 'close', 'snapping', 'years', 'torment', 'really', 'movie', 'sympathetic', 'tragedy', 'King', 'intended', 'Ditto', 'Rena', 'Sofer', 'gym', 'teacher', 'who', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'religious', 'hysteric', 'mother', 'Clarkson', 'wisely', 'role', 'rather', 're-launching', 'Piper', 'Laurie-style', 'hysterics', 'adaptation', 'much', 'closer', 'plot', 'spirit', 'book.What', 'not', 'so', 'good', '.daggone', 'changed', 'ending', 'again', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'so', 'enough', 'said', 'See', 'one', 'prefer', 'Sue', 'Snell', 'not', 'as', 'sympathetic', 'was', 'book', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Kandyse', 'McClure', 'miscast', 'way', 'part', 'was', 'written', 'little', 'think', 'Ditto', 'Emilie', 'de', 'Ravin', 'Carrie', 'chief', 'tormenter', 'Chris', 'Jorgenson', 'was', 'bitchy', 'unlikable', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'was', 'capable', 'stunt', 'Many', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'obviously', 'digital-certainly', 'films', 'far', 'higher', 'budgets', 'have', 'had', 'problem', 'Hulk', ""'re"", 'looking', 'direction', 'USA', 'TV', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'job', 'things', 'considered.The', 'plot', 'updated', 'well', 'references', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'internet', 'enjoyed', 'book', 'are', 'curious', 'rental', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'just', 'loved', 'book', 'more', 'life', 'maybe', 'should', 'buy']",N/A
