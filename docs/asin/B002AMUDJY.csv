Churchill struggled to inform the nation that Germany was arming itself for war, but nobody was listening. He was basically put out to pasture.

His wife, Clementine, stoically supportive has moments where her pain almost wins out over her devotion to her husband, but her courage comes through in the end just as his did.

I'm not sure if it is because Gleeson has always been one of my more favorite actors, but this film really worked for me.

This appears to be a sequel, or more like a continuation, of THE GATHERING STORM, which was  about Churchill in the pre WW2 years. I have to ask myself if I would have given this another star had I seen it without having seen the other one, and I honestly don't know. I felt that there were jumps in time in this one which were too broad, but then again, WW 2 is a big subject, and unless you have several hours in which to portray it, or even one important man's participation in related events, I suppose it may be necessary to omit large blocks of time. Next comes the comparison-in this one, Brendan Gleeson (Churchill), and Janet McTeer had an uphill battle to begin with, if they were to compare favorably against the likes of Albert Finney and Vanessa Redgrave in the earlier production. In my opinion, they did not quite make the cut. One of the major online rating sites also has the first film rated higher, though not by the margin I feel is appropriate. Overall, I would say that WW 2 history buffs, and those with an intense interest in Churchill should make this a must see.

We were not disappointed by this HPO production or the Gathering Storm, although I liked the actor who played Churchill in Into the Storm a bit better.  If you are a WWII or Churchill scholar you will most likely not like the portrayal of Churchill as it is mostly focused on the tough decisions he had to make under extradorinary conditions.  Historians like to put their political spin on world leaders.  I like to understand what they were up against and how it impacted them personally. It is so much easier to judge someone or the time they were in, in hindsight and from a safe historical distance.After watching Foyles War, a 5 year series on British TV, I wanted to learn more about how the war was viewed from Hastings and the cliffs of Dover, what it was really like for the people that lived 21 miles from Hitler's conquests.  Foyles War is excellent as seen through the eyes of a police officer in Hastings.  These two HBO movies fill in the part about what the leaders were facing as they sent their young men to battle.  Both in this movie and in Foly's War they have reenact the fleat of boats, mostly fishermen, that rescued 330,000 men from Dunkurk with many of them loosing their own lives to save the troops.  In these days of constant bikering and selfish greed it is very uplifting to watch what simple people are able to accomplish when inspired by their leaders.",5,A Touch of WWI and It's Leaders for Those of Us Who Were Not There,1262390400,"01 2, 2010",2010,1491,"['watching', 'Gathering', 'Storm', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'came', 'next', 'terms', 'life', 'W.', 'Churchill', 'were', 'not', 'disappointed', 'HPO', 'production', 'Gathering', 'Storm', 'liked', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Churchill', 'Into', 'Storm', 'bit', 'better', 'are', 'WWII', 'Churchill', 'scholar', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'not', 'portrayal', 'Churchill', 'mostly', 'focused', 'tough', 'decisions', 'had', 'make', 'extradorinary', 'conditions', 'Historians', 'put', 'political', 'spin', 'world', 'leaders', 'like', 'understand', 'what', 'were', 'up', 'how', 'impacted', 'personally', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'judge', 'someone', 'time', 'were', 'hindsight', 'safe', 'historical', 'distance.After', 'watching', 'Foyles', 'War', '5', 'year', 'series', 'British', 'TV', 'wanted', 'learn', 'more', 'how', 'war', 'was', 'viewed', 'Hastings', 'cliffs', 'Dover', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'like', 'people', 'lived', '21', 'miles', 'Hitler', 'conquests', 'Foyles', 'War', 'excellent', 'seen', 'eyes', 'police', 'officer', 'Hastings', 'two', 'HBO', 'movies', 'fill', 'part', 'what', 'leaders', 'were', 'facing', 'sent', 'young', 'men', 'battle', 'movie', 'Foly', 'War', 'have', 'reenact', 'fleat', 'boats', 'mostly', 'fishermen', 'rescued', '330,000', 'men', 'Dunkurk', 'many', 'loosing', 'own', 'lives', 'save', 'troops', 'days', 'constant', 'bikering', 'selfish', 'greed', 'very', 'uplifting', 'watch', 'what', 'simple', 'people', 'are', 'able', 'accomplish', 'when', 'inspired', 'leaders']",Into the Storm
1258614,A2BSZPRBKYAB2K,B002AMUDJY,"Joe Owen ""Joe""","[0, 0]","HBO Films produced and released this excellent film staring Brendan Gleeson as Sir Winston Churchill from around 1938 to the post World War II years.  Mr. Gleeson does an outstanding job of portraying Winston Churchill in his triumph, his courage, his stuborness, his falacies, his focus, and his love for his family and country.  Winston Churchill was often crass, often short tempered, but always focused in achieving his goal of defeating NAZI Germany and saving the British Empire.  Mr. Gleeson portrays all of these characteristics that were prevelant in Churchill.  The supporting actors of this film also do an outstanding job of showing what Churchill's family and friends were going thru during the war years.  This film does not dwell on specific years of World War II, but jumps ahead from 1938-1940 the beginning of the war, Dunkirk, and The Battle of Britain, to 1941 when the USA enters the war and you see the beginning of the friendship between Churchill and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, to the Normandy Invasion of 1944, to the triumph of Great Britain when Germany surrenders in 1945.  Between these film eras you see Churchill at the Tehran Conference when he, Roosevelt, and Josef Stalin meet to discuss the Normandy Invasion, to the Yalta Conference in 1945 when you see Churchill with a declining FDR courting Josef Stalin.  Then the post-war years when Churchill was defeated as Prime Minister and the Labor Party was victorious over the Conservative Party.  Winston Churchill was a ""war minister"" who led his country bravely during World War II, after the war thhough he was ""out of touch"" with public opinion and hurt his career in politics when he compared the Labor Party to the Gestapo of Nazi Germany.  This truely hurt his reputation with the British People and his wife warned him not to make that remark during a radio broadcast. But, he did and it cost him in post-war politics.This is an outstanding movie that is suprebly acted by all, great sets and locations, and an interesting story of the triumph of Sir Winston Churchill portrayed excellently by Brendan Gleeson.

I also thought the sequences were a little contrived in order to squeeze in every famous one-liner delivered by Churchill in one movie. I think as much as anything it needed to be longer to do justice to such an extraordinary period in history. Perhaps this should have been a ten part series rather than a two hour movie, or concentrated on just ONE event such as losing the election or the fall of Singapore rather than trying to cover them all in two hours.

I didn't think Gleeson was quite as outstanding as Albert Finney in GATHERING STORM or McTeer as Redgrave but they both gave excellent performances. There is no question that Churchill, warts and all, is one of the most fascinating men in modern history. In the GATHERING STORM we learn of Churchill's sense of destiny for his life. In this film we see why he may have indeed been destined for 'such a time as this'. The circumstances are overwhelming for Britain. The future of the country and the empire are literally on the line. The film begins with the very early stages of the war in 1940 and quickly flashes forward to 1945 with Churchill and family vacationing in France by the ocean, waiting for the results of the election for prime minister. These flashbacks and flash forwards are both the strength and weakness of the film. They show us the 'before' and 'after' Churchill but often make it a little confusing at first until you understand what's going on. It also helps to have some knowledge about Churchill and WWII as the scenes are usually fairly short and don't give a lot of context. What you do you get is some very interesting insights into the mind of Churchill in the various war situations. For example, when deciding whether to bomb Dresden, his military advisers are concerned about civilian casualties but Churchill shows no concern for civilians and we learn shortly after the decision that 58,000 civilians are killed and 200,000 lose their occupations due to the destruction of war factories. We learn that he has loved military strategy from a young child and people question whether this might just another 'game' for him. His relationship with 'Clemmy' is also a fascinating one. She is a strong person in her own right and without her, it is doubtful Churchill would have fulfilled his 'destiny' in the way he did.

For one thing, the story does a poor job of telling why Churchill was so instrumental to England's survival in WWII. The story is random and bouncing and really does a poor job of showing both Churchill's character and the events he lived in. The first film, ""The Gathering Storm,"" was told much better as it gave a firm view of Churchill and showed who he was and what he was trying to accomplish.While I do enjoy seeing Brendan Gleeson act, Albert Finney did a much better job of catching Churchill's often difficult and brilliant spirit. The rest of the cast, except of Churchill's wife Clementine were almost wall paper.  The best role which went unexplored was Churchill's first encounter with  Montgomery.

Bush), I found the movie adequate but not as inspiring as it could have been.His great speeches on tape are delivered better on tape than in the movie (I do not recommend the books of his speeches, the publishers failed to put them in the original poetic form for proper appreciation and reading).The movie misses a huge opportunity, when Churchill is so very rude to his man-servant, they substituted the wife asking him to stop, boring, to the actual exchange in which the man-servant stands up to Churchill, saying he is very rude, and Churchill's answering, ""yes, but I am a great man,"" to which the man servant has an accepting acknowledgement.The movie also fails to capture the actual nature of the bunker war rooms, something I visit each time I visit London, and they went cheap on Dunkirk, which really was one of England's finest hours.  Had they gone to the trouble of filming Dunkirk, admittedly a great expense, this film would have been a five, I get goose-bumps just thinking about the flotilla of small craft managing to bring back the entire British Army.My favorite book on Churchill isTHE LAST LION: 2 VOLUME BOXED SETby William Manchester, also available individually.For serious documentaries about lessons of war and the underlying malfeasance of war, see:The Fog of War - Eleven Lessons from the life of Robert S.

Here the angst is the anticipation of the results of the vote of confidence to keep him on as Prime Minister.
