1523939,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0070YPWAW,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[27, 31]","Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the legendary German writer and the man of all talents, from art to science and considered a genius of modern German literature who is known for his works of poetry, drama, philosophy and science.Known for his drama ""Faust"" and the ""Marienbad Elegy"" to name a few, when it comes to romance stories, Goethe will forever be remembered for his short epistolary  and loosely autobiographical novel titled ""Die Leiden des jungen Werthers"" (The Sorrows of Young Werther), which was published back in 1774.It was a novel that was inspired by pain of loving someone so much, but yet not being able to be with them.  Pain of losing someone and for love, a sacrifice had to be made.Suffice to say, ""The Sorrows of Young Werther"" was a hit and a novel that would propel Goethe to superstar status and even created a fad in which many young men would take their lives because some interpreted ""suicide"" as the best form of showing one's love and despair.It was a story written by a Goethe as a young adult, while he was studying law in Leipzing.  While studying law, he met a girl and through circumstance, ""The Sorrows of Young Werther"" was inspired by his love for Charlotte Buff.  A story about two people who loved each other but were unable to be together because she was arranged to marry someone else and keep the family financially supported, while the tragedy was inspired by his friend Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem, who killed himself after the woman he had an affair with, chose her husband over him.  But also the disdain of how people who committed suicide were treated posthumously at the time (people who killed themselves were looked at with the lowest disdain).While Goethe did use the name of Werther, the real life Goethe was not so pleased about the popularity of his novel as he learned that it also outed his real relationship with Charlotte Buff, who was already married to Johann Christian Kestner.  Also, for Goethe, he didn't like how most people knew of him only through this work despite authoring other novels and literary work and disliked how he was pigeonholed as part of the Romantic movement.Needless to say, to this day, ""The Sorrows of Young Werther"" is looked at as impressive romantic novel and a storyline that has been romanticized through other books and poetry.  And once again, the story of Goethe and his relationship has been romanticized by director/writer Philipp St&ouml;lzl (""North Face"", ""Rammstein: Lichtspielhaus"", ""Baby"") and fellow co-writers Christoph Muller and Alexander Dydyna for the 2010 film ""Goethe!"" (aka in the U.S. as ""Young Goethe in Love"").And the film will now be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Music Box Films in April 2012.VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Young Goethe in Love"" is presented in widescreen 2:35:1 and Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround.  With this film, you can expect beautiful cinematography moments courtesy of Kolja Brandt.  The scene featuring both Goethe and Lotte together in the rain as they share their first kiss is an amazing scene and shot wonderfully.  The set and costume design captures the look and feel of the late 1700's and for the most part, I was enjoying the overall cinematography and thinking how beautiful this film would look on Blu-ray.As for the audio, audio is clear and while there are moments of gun shots that can be heard through the surround channels and some crowd-based ambiance, ""Young Goethe in Love"" is a dialogue-driven film.  As for subtitles, subtitles are in English and are easy to read.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Young Goethe in Love"" comes with three special features:The Making of ""Young Goethe in Love""The Visual Effects of GoetheTheatrical and International TrailersJUDGMENT CALL:For the hopeless romantics, ""Young Goethe in Love"" is a fantastic, enchanting romantic comedy!And while there are people who disdain dramatizations of historical individuals, especially one as notable as Johann Goethe and creating a romantic story revolved around the creation of his well-known epistolary and loosely-based autobiographical novel, it all comes down to one's appreciation for romantic films and also romantic comedy.While ""The Sorrows of Young Werther"" is a love story that captures a young man's pain and broken heart after knowing that he can't be with the woman he loves, because of her family commitment, what I enjoyed about ""Young Goethe in Love"" was how the writers were able to craft a story integrating Lotte Buff in somewhat of a more positive character for Goethe.In the novel, the character of Werther makes the ultimate sacrifice for his love for Lotte.  In the film, loosely-based on the real life situation between Goethe and Lotte, it is Lotte who makes a sacrifice for her love towards Goethe, but it's a sacrifice that you don't see coming and leaves you with a smile on your face because although this is a romantic film, it's a romantic film where both people can not be together due to circumstances, but they make one last effort not by physical contact, but by action to show their love.So, in many ways, the basis of Goethe's ""The Sorrows of Young Werther"" is a testament to a love that can not be shared in reality, but a love that will forever live in poetry.  How romantic is that?The performances by both Alexander Fehling and Miriam Stein were delightful and fantastic, cinematography, costume and set design were well-done and a screenplay that manages to balance the romantic drama and comedy fairly well. And enough to keep the storyline from straying into banality.Overall, ""Young Goethe in Love"" is a film that will captivate the hopeless romantics and may turn off those who have a disdain towards dramatizations of well-known figures.  But in the end, I have to say it has been many, many years since I have been captivated by a recent romantic drama and I have to say that ""Young Goethe in Love"" is a delightful, wonderful film that will no doubt captivate the hopeless romantic within you.Definitely recommended!",4,"For the hopeless romantics, ""Young Goethe in Love"" is a fantastic, enchanting romantic comedy!",1335571200,"04

1523940,A2L7BSIVPHEAEL,B0070YPWAW,"Derek Hunter ""chaos riddler""","[8, 8]","Despite the American distributor's shameless try to milk the Shakespeare in Love audience as much as possible by changing the title to the above, this film is definitely not trying to be the same movie.  Sure it has some similarities and the filmmakers were no doubt aware of this, but the tone of the film, the story itself, and the emotional power are very different from each other.  Goethe! (as was the original European title) is, sure, like Shakes in Love in that it's about a famous artist when he was young and right before he &#34;finds his voice&#34; and what causes him to find that voice is romantic heartbreak.  The major difference to me is that in Goethe's case we know this to be a fact.  If you've read The Sorrows of Young Werther or know of the story or know of Goethe's personal life, then you know what happens in this film - while they twist things here and there - is for the most part all true.  Fact relates to fiction in an odd way but it relates to in a more profound way when you know the fiction has solid ground of fact supporting it.  When you watch Goethe in Love and know of the real Goethe, there is an added tenderness and heartbreak to what you see simply because you know it all really happened.  When you watch Shakespeare in Love, we really have no clue whatsoever if what we're watching happened or not, and in fact, if you know at least a little bit about Shakespeare biography, whether you believe it was Shakespeare or someone else, then you know what happens in Shakespeare in Love most likely DID NOT happen.",5,Not Shakespeare in love ...,1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,1553,"['American', 'distributor', 'shameless', 'try', 'milk', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'audience', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'changing', 'title', 'above', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'same', 'movie', 'Sure', 'similarities', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'doubt', 'aware', 'tone', 'film', 'story', 'emotional', 'power', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'other', 'Goethe', 'was', 'original', 'European', 'title', 'sure', 'Shakes', 'Love', 'famous', 'artist', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'right', '34', 'voice', '34', 'what', 'find', 'voice', 'romantic', 'heartbreak', 'major', 'difference', 'Goethe', 'case', 'know', 'be', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Sorrows', 'Young', 'Werther', 'know', 'story', 'know', 'Goethe', 'personal', 'life', 'then', 'know', 'what', 'film', 'twist', 'things', 'here', 'there', 'most', 'part', 'true', 'Fact', 'fiction', 'odd', 'way', 'more', 'profound', 'way', 'when', 'know', 'fiction', 'solid', 'ground', 'fact', 'supporting', 'When', 'watch', 'Goethe', 'Love', 'know', 'real', 'Goethe', 'added', 'tenderness', 'heartbreak', 'what', 'see', 'simply', 'know', 'really', 'happened', 'When', 'watch', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'really', 'have', 'clue', 'whatsoever', 'what', ""'re"", 'watching', 'happened', 'not', 'fact', 'know', 'least', 'little', 'bit', 'Shakespeare', 'biography', 'believe', 'was', 'Shakespeare', 'someone', 'else', 'then', 'know', 'what', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'most', 'likely', 'DID', 'NOT', 'happen']",Young Goethe in Love

But - are the creators of this film having a bit of fun with us viewers?

It is ""Young Goethe in Love"" (original title ""Goethe!"") directed by Philipp St&ouml;lzl (""North Face""), starring likeable Alexander Fehling as a failed law student/poet/playwright who later becomes one of the world's most famous men of letters. Though the film's story is pretty formulaic and predictable, ""Young Goethe in Love"" remains entertaining throughout, thanks to the solid performances from the entire cast.Set in 1772, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, 23-year-old, is sent by his father to a rural town of Wetzlar, where he works as a law clerk under Counselor Kestner (Moritz Bleibtreu), to become a lawyer. Fun-loving and easy-going Goethe falls in love with a local girl Lotte Buff (Miriam Stein), and she also loves him, but her father has another plan for his daughter.Charlotte (Lotte) Buff is a real-life person, generally thought as inspiration for ""The Sorrows of Young Werther,"" but you don't have to have read the book to enjoy ""Young Goethe in Love."" Though the basic storyline resembles that of ""Shakespeare in Love,"" some nice twists are added in the second half of it.

Reviewer,"[3, 6]","I am giving this only 2 stars because it is just a costume drama.Yes, it is about the young Goethe falling in love, but take out the name ""Goethe"" and you simply have a romantic period piece.What was missing, is what was included in ""Shakespeare In Love"" -- the brilliance of a young Shakespeare.  This film should have showed hints at the genius potential of young Goethe.  It only shows -- at the end of the film -- that he finally had a novel published and became famous in Europe as a romantic novelist.  But that is less than 10% of what he is remembered for today (e.g. he formulated the spectrum for light).  The film does not tease us with any of his upcoming scientific genius.In the film he is just a 23 yr old kid who falls in love, is heart broken, and writes a novel (at the end of the film) about loss of love and ensuing sorrow.  Again, take the name ""Goethe"" out of the title and insert ""Manfred"" or any other German name, and you have the same film -- without the historical draw.",2,Rent -- Do Not Buy,1354752000,"12 6, 2012",2012,997,"['am', 'giving', 'only', '2', 'stars', 'just', 'costume', 'drama.Yes', 'young', 'Goethe', 'falling', 'love', 'take', 'out', 'name', 'Goethe', 'simply', 'have', 'romantic', 'period', 'piece.What', 'was', 'missing', 'what', 'was', 'included', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'brilliance', 'young', 'Shakespeare', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'showed', 'hints', 'genius', 'potential', 'young', 'Goethe', 'only', 'end', 'film', 'finally', 'had', 'novel', 'published', 'became', 'famous', 'Europe', 'romantic', 'novelist', 'less', '10', '%', 'what', 'remembered', 'today', 'e.g', 'formulated', 'spectrum', 'light', 'film', 'not', 'tease', 'upcoming', 'scientific', 'genius.In', 'film', 'just', '23', 'yr', 'old', 'kid', 'who', 'love', 'heart', 'broken', 'novel', 'end', 'film', 'loss', 'love', 'ensuing', 'sorrow', 'Again', 'take', 'name', 'Goethe', 'title', 'insert', 'Manfred', 'other', 'German', 'name', 'have', 'same', 'film', 'historical', 'draw']",Young Goethe in Love

The young actor who plays Goethe is charming and engaging and the story is fairly true to Geothe's real life.  I would have liked to have more time spent on understanding why Goethe's story of Young Werner so captured the hearts of his fellow countrymen.  Alas, this question is never answered which leaves me wondering what the point of the movie was?
