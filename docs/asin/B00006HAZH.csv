They kept hope, and despite their own troubles they had concern for their  fellow man.Jemina Rooper played the oldest daughter, a young teenager. Jenny Agutter was the mother.

The production is in general careful and imaginative. I have one criticism only -- why, oh why, do those responsible for Masterpiece Theater imagine that we are incapable of appreciating such an offering as this without ""commentary"" before and after it?

This is a story of three children whose father is falsely imprisoned.  They and their mother retreat into the countryside where they live  a hand to mouth existence for several months.  Nesbit included quite a few of her own democratic socialist beliefs into The Railway Children, but the ideology does not detract from the story.This DVD is beautifully done so that the outdoor scenes, especially, are magnificent.  The children's adventures and their developing friendships with the people who live in and around their small village are all lovingly filmed.

And I think it is in my opinion a very well made production.  Jemima Rooper as the oldest girl Bobbie is very good acting.  Little girl Phillis (Clare Thompson) took a bit to get used to because they are all so darn british.  Yes, sometimes they are hard to understand, especially the luggage carrier.  Nonetheless I got used to all of these characters and loved them by the end of the movie.  Maybe I learned also a little british accent on the side.  Then I read that the mother, actress Jenny Agutter, played the child Bobbie in the 1970's version of this film.  And since that film is supposed to be superior to this one I got to see that also now although its out of print and a bit expensive at the time.  But I suppose its Christmas time and I WILL get it.  It might be out of print forever.The menu indicates that there are subtitles which I tried to get into when I did not understand every single spoken word.  But the subtitles option was closed.  Instead I learned now that I have to use the TV's remote control to access the subtitles on the DVD.I still give it 5 stars since its one of my favorite family movies of all time now.  {The others are ANNE OF GREEN GABLES, THE ROAD TO AVONLEA, THE WALTONS, SUMMER'S END, ALAN & NAOMI, BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA (the original from 1985), WHALE RIDER (australian), NESTHAEKCHEN (german), A LITTLE PRINCESS (with Amelia Shankley, british), THE MIRACLE WORKER (with Eisenberg and also the first version with Patty Duke), A PIECE OF SKY (german), TINKE - LITTLE STRONG GIRL (danish), MADITA (swedish), WHEN I WAS SEVEN (french), and THE BUTTERFLY (french}.}Just so that you know where I am coming from.",5,Very nice family movie,1196553600,"12 2, 2007",2007,1773,"['reading', 'not', 'very', 'favorible', 'reviews', 'here', '2000', 'RAILWAY', 'CHILDREN', 'got', 'film', 'see', 'think', 'opinion', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'production', 'Jemima', 'Rooper', 'oldest', 'girl', 'Bobbie', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'Little', 'girl', 'Phillis', 'Clare', 'Thompson', 'took', 'bit', 'get', 'used', 'are', 'so', 'darn', 'british', 'Yes', 'sometimes', 'are', 'hard', 'understand', 'especially', 'luggage', 'carrier', 'Nonetheless', 'got', 'used', 'characters', 'loved', 'end', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'learned', 'also', 'little', 'british', 'accent', 'side', 'Then', 'read', 'mother', 'actress', 'Jenny', 'Agutter', 'played', 'child', 'Bobbie', '1970', 'version', 'film', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'superior', 'one', 'got', 'see', 'also', 'now', 'print', 'bit', 'expensive', 'time', 'suppose', 'Christmas', 'time', 'WILL', 'get', 'might', 'be', 'print', 'forever.The', 'menu', 'are', 'subtitles', 'tried', 'get', 'when', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'single', 'spoken', 'word', 'subtitles', 'option', 'was', 'closed', 'Instead', 'learned', 'now', 'have', 'use', 'TV', 'remote', 'control', 'access', 'subtitles', 'DVD.I', 'still', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'one', 'favorite', 'family', 'movies', 'time', 'now', 'others', 'are', 'ANNE', 'OF', 'GREEN', 'GABLES', 'THE', 'ROAD', 'TO', 'AVONLEA', 'THE', 'WALTONS', 'SUMMER', 'END', 'ALAN', 'NAOMI', 'BRIDGE', 'TO', 'TERABITHIA', 'original', '1985', 'WHALE', 'RIDER', 'australian', 'NESTHAEKCHEN', 'german', 'LITTLE', 'PRINCESS', 'Amelia', 'Shankley', 'british', 'THE', 'MIRACLE', 'WORKER', 'Eisenberg', 'also', 'first', 'version', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'A', 'PIECE', 'OF', 'SKY', 'german', 'TINKE', 'LITTLE', 'STRONG', 'GIRL', 'danish', 'MADITA', 'swedish', 'WHEN', 'WAS', 'SEVEN', 'french', 'THE', 'BUTTERFLY', 'french', 'Just', 'so', 'know', 'where', 'am', 'coming']",Masterpiece Theatre: Railway Children
