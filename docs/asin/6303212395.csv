To today's standards the special effects aren't much, but to me the overall story is great.  The movie is scary for young children and, being older, It is actualy depressing, but it redeems itself in the end.  Of course movies are different than books most of the time, since they are adaptions.  The story is neverending because it can be watched again and the book can be read again and again and again.  I think this will stay a classic for those who first saw it as children, otherwise, I don't know :)  At the very least, the theme song is pretty cool and was even featured in two Dance Dance Revolution games.  p.s.

When I was young, I watched it several times a day until I knew every line, could sing every note of the opening theme song ~ even still to this day.The Never Ending Story has two heroes and two villains. The first hero and villain are outside the book, high above the fantasy.Bastian is a young kid that is blessed with a great imagination (He gets in trouble for drawing unicorns in his math book.) He lacks courage and is always being beaten up by bullies and stuffed into dumpsters. While running away from these bullies, he hides in a bookstore. When in there, he makes off with a book that has the snake-twisted orrin on the cover...you guessed it...the neverending story.&quot;The Nothing&quot;, is the first ultra-villain. It's reason for existence is a secret that I don't want to spoil. It is destroying fantasia for its own means(Brought to life by the guys that invisioned The Empire Strikes Back!) The Nothing is becoming rampant, and the ruler, the Empress is dying. The people of fantasia, the world in which all fantasy resides, seek help from a great warrior Atreau. The ultimate second villain, A massive wolf with Glowing green eyes, takes flight through the forests to stop Atreau on his quest.There is so much to the story! It is the type of movie you'll want to watch over and over until your player starts steaming.It will soon be on DVD in September, so wait until then if your a crazed dvd loony like me.

364286,A1A4DEENGHK51T,6303212395,Alan Attebery,"[4, 4]","""The NeverEnding Story"" is, in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made. I was first mesmerized by this movie when it came out in 1984, and all of these years later I am still completely glued to the screen when I watch it.When Bastian is tricked into borrowing a particular book, he opts to skip school and read it in the attic. The book, as it turns out, involves him in more ways than one. It is a story about Fantasia, a world that is succumbing to The Nothing. The Childlike Empress, who is also ill, sends for Fantasia's best hero, Atreyu, to find a way to stop the Nothing. Along the way, he meets a luckdragon name Falcor, and together they bring Fantasia's salvation back to the Childlike Empress.The casting of Atreyu (Noah Hathaway), Bastian (Barret Oliver), and the Childlike Empress (Tami Stronach) was outstanding. The emotions that these three displayed in the movie was nothing short of perfection, ranging the guantlet from estatic, to sad, to fearful, etc. They are the very reasons that you will get wrapped up in this movie.It is interesting to note that, for some reason, these three did not enjoy huge success after the movie. Granted, ""The NeverEnding Story"" was not a box office success, but there was raw talent in them waiting to be unleashed. Noah Hathway disappeared from in front of the screen in 1986, made one movie in 1992, and disappeared again until showing up behind the scenes in two movies in 1999 and one in 2001. Barret Oliver starred in several movies (best known is D.A.R.Y.L in 1985) and made many TV guest appearences until 1989, when he disappeared from the screen. And Tami Stronach was introduced to movie goers in this movie, but never made another movie after it.I wholeheartedly recommend that you buy this movie. You will never regret it.",5,FALCOR!!!,1026086400,"07 8, 2002",2002,1792,"['NeverEnding', 'Story', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'was', 'first', 'mesmerized', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1984', 'years', 'later', 'am', 'still', 'completely', 'glued', 'screen', 'when', 'watch', 'it.When', 'Bastian', 'tricked', 'borrowing', 'particular', 'book', 'skip', 'school', 'read', 'attic', 'book', 'out', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'story', 'Fantasia', 'world', 'succumbing', 'Nothing', 'Childlike', 'Empress', 'who', 'also', 'ill', 'Fantasia', 'best', 'hero', 'Atreyu', 'find', 'way', 'stop', 'Nothing', 'way', 'luckdragon', 'name', 'Falcor', 'together', 'bring', 'Fantasia', 'salvation', 'back', 'Childlike', 'Empress.The', 'casting', 'Atreyu', 'Noah', 'Hathaway', 'Bastian', 'Barret', 'Oliver', 'Childlike', 'Empress', 'Tami', 'Stronach', 'was', 'outstanding', 'emotions', 'three', 'displayed', 'movie', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'perfection', 'ranging', 'guantlet', 'estatic', 'sad', 'fearful', 'etc', 'are', 'very', 'reasons', 'will', 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'movie.It', 'interesting', 'note', 'reason', 'three', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'huge', 'success', 'movie', 'Granted', 'NeverEnding', 'Story', 'was', 'not', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'there', 'was', 'raw', 'talent', 'waiting', 'be', 'unleashed', 'Noah', 'Hathway', 'disappeared', 'front', 'screen', '1986', 'made', 'one', 'movie', '1992', 'disappeared', 'again', 'showing', 'up', 'scenes', 'two', 'movies', '1999', 'one', '2001', 'Barret', 'Oliver', 'starred', 'several', 'movies', 'best', 'known', 'D.A.R.Y.L', '1985', 'made', 'many', 'TV', 'guest', 'appearences', '1989', 'when', 'disappeared', 'screen', 'Tami', 'Stronach', 'was', 'introduced', 'movie', 'goers', 'movie', 'never', 'made', 'movie', 'it.I', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'buy', 'movie', 'will', 'never', 'regret']",The NeverEnding Story VHS

364297,A12KDW2EB3JOLH,6303212395,Amazon Customer,"[134, 155]","Like so many other reviewers, I watched this as a small child. My kindergarten teacher just loved it. At the time, I found it horrible, dark and scary. (I was a VERY wimpy movie watcher, Raiders of the Lost Ark sent me into hysterics)Years later, I decided to bite the bullet and try it again. I found it to be a lovely pure fantasy with (for the time) great special effects and good music. Let's face it, you either love electronic fantasy scores or you hate them, there's no real middle ground.That said, I do think that this movie is too scary for small children, parents should use their own experience and knowledge to decide when their child is ready. (That is what the PG means)This is the tale of a sensitive child who finds himself being absorbed into the magical book he is reading, called the Neverending Story. (That is where the movie gets its name, the story is different for each person, thus it never ends. There was no ripoff) Dragons, monsters and beautiful images dance in his head as he slowly realizes that the characters in the book are talking to him.The movie is based on a German novel of the same name by Michael Ende. (a master of surrealist fairy tales for grown ups) Yes, the book is better and yes, the movie only takes the first half of the book. But really, isn't it better to take the first half mostly intact rather than try to cram in every single scene and totally alienate all viewers? What this book really needs is a miniseries but until then, this movie is great.Two other questions raised were what was the name Bastion yelled. Moonchild, and it wasn't his mother's name in the book (though it is possible if she were a hippy '_') The second question was about the attic. AS the book was written by a German, one may presume that some German schools have attics. Or maybe it was just another fairy tale element added to make the story more surreal. (Attics always seem to figure into fairy tales) either way, it is a relatively small thing to worry about.This is a very fine example of 80s fantasy, it has a good message and if you or your children are not easily frightened, it is a very good movie on a rainy day.

364303,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303212395,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Opening with cheesy 80's Europop and littered from head to toe with dated visuals and hilarious makeup jobs; `The Neverending Story' remains one of my favorite films and one of those childhood memories I wish to hold onto forever.  I can't even count to amount of times I've seen this film; it was basically on repeat throughout the entirety of my childhood.  Being released the year before I was born didn't hurt any.  When I think of iconic moments in my upbringing, the introduction of this film ranks even higher than the first time I saw `The Return of the Jedi'; seriously.In rewatching this film for the near hundredth time the other night with my young daughter (who was equally amused and yet totally confused) I found myself finding a depth within this film that was completely wasted on my youth.  Having never read the novel (for a film that flaunts the beauty of reading, I never even knew that this was an adaptation) I cannot say if the `meanings' I gathered upon a recent viewing were intended of if they are of my own imaginings, but I must say that this film transcended it's own entertainment value for me the other night, for now it carries with it a heavier weight.I'm going to scream SPOILERS and get that out of the way right now.Where to begin with my interpretations is a hard thing to gage, since the themes presented here are varied in themselves and so it's kind of a shot in the dark with where to start.  A brief rundown of the film finds a young boy named Bastian who is finding it difficult to move on after the death of his mother (the cause is never addressed) and he is frequently tormented by bullies and failing his classes and all of this cumulates into a cry for help in the form of...reading.  Yes, Bastian steals a book (which he promises to return) and holes himself up in the attic of his school where he indulges in a fantasy world where he has a direct say in `how the story will end'.  The story revolves around Fantasia, a world that dwells within the `hopes and dreams' of humankind.  A wicked `nothing' is destroying the world, swallowing everything and replacing it with a void.  A young warrior is summoned and sent out to find a cure for the ailing Empress, who is the only one who can stop the Nothing.The obvious here is that this Fantasia is a representation of Bastian's childhood.  In youth we are smothered with `hopes and dreams' and yet, as we age, we lose those `dreams' and replace them with reality, which is usually far less grand than we anticipated.  There are a number of films that have riffed on this narrative.  I've recently reviewed `The Red Balloon', which tackles this idea, and we are mostly all familiar with 2009's underappreciated masterpiece, `Where the Wild Things Are'.  In `The Neverending Story', Bastian's recent loss of his mother has dissolved his innocence.  He is finding it hard to function in `reality' and he isn't getting any support from those around him.  His own father urges him to `move on', which is not something easily done, especially for a child.  In essence, Bastian's own father is forcing him to grow up way too fast, and all Bastian needs is to remain a child for as long as possible.What struck me even more so upon this recent viewing was the religious (or so they seem) tremors that streamline this films core.  In a conversation between Atreyu and the evil G'mork, G'mork mentions that the Nothing wants to destroy hope because the loss of hope makes it easier to control people.  When thinking of the war between God and Satan, it seems as if this film (and quite possibly the novel from which it stems) was attempting to illuminate the plight that Satan's influence has had on the world today.  By destroying man's faith, he has stripped away their hope and thus made it easier to control man.Wow, that's very unlike me (I very rarely mention religion in reviews), but it struck me so powerfully while watching this film that I felt the need to say all that.Casting the films lyrical intentions aside, the stunning (at times) cinematography and the exciting flow of the films elements make this a great adventure story that still holds up today.  Sure, it's not as polished as some recent fantasy films, but it reminds me of home and that nostalgia will never leave me.  Noah Hathaway's performance is quite terrible, but Barret Oliver's in genuinely fantastic, instantly iconic in its own right.Watch this movie, and love every minute of it!",5,What dreams may come...,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,4454,"['Opening', 'cheesy', '80', 'Europop', 'littered', 'head', 'toe', 'dated', 'visuals', 'hilarious', 'makeup', 'jobs', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'one', 'childhood', 'memories', 'wish', 'hold', 'forever', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'count', 'amount', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'was', 'basically', 'repeat', 'entirety', 'childhood', 'Being', 'released', 'year', 'was', 'born', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'When', 'think', 'iconic', 'moments', 'upbringing', 'introduction', 'film', 'even', 'higher', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'rewatching', 'film', 'near', 'hundredth', 'time', 'other', 'night', 'young', 'daughter', 'who', 'was', 'equally', 'amused', 'yet', 'totally', 'confused', 'found', 'finding', 'depth', 'film', 'was', 'completely', 'wasted', 'youth', 'Having', 'never', 'read', 'novel', 'film', 'beauty', 'reading', 'never', 'even', 'knew', 'was', 'adaptation', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'meanings', 'gathered', 'recent', 'viewing', 'were', 'intended', 'are', 'own', 'imaginings', 'must', 'say', 'film', 'transcended', 'own', 'entertainment', 'value', 'other', 'night', 'now', 'heavier', 'weight.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'scream', 'SPOILERS', 'get', 'way', 'right', 'now.Where', 'begin', 'interpretations', 'hard', 'thing', 'gage', 'themes', 'presented', 'here', 'are', 'varied', 'kind', 'shot', 'dark', 'where', 'start', 'brief', 'rundown', 'film', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Bastian', 'who', 'finding', 'difficult', 'move', 'death', 'mother', 'cause', 'never', 'addressed', 'frequently', 'tormented', 'bullies', 'failing', 'classes', 'cry', 'help', 'form', 'reading', 'Yes', 'Bastian', 'steals', 'book', 'return', 'up', 'attic', 'school', 'where', 'fantasy', 'world', 'where', 'direct', 'say', 'how', 'story', 'will', 'end', 'story', 'Fantasia', 'world', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'humankind', 'wicked', 'nothing', 'destroying', 'world', 'swallowing', 'everything', 'replacing', 'void', 'young', 'warrior', 'summoned', 'sent', 'out', 'find', 'cure', 'ailing', 'Empress', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'stop', 'Nothing.The', 'obvious', 'here', 'Fantasia', 'representation', 'Bastian', 'childhood', 'youth', 'are', 'smothered', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'yet', 'age', 'lose', 'dreams', 'replace', 'reality', 'usually', 'far', 'less', 'grand', 'anticipated', 'are', 'number', 'films', 'have', 'riffed', 'narrative', ""'ve"", 'recently', 'reviewed', 'Red', 'Balloon', 'idea', 'are', 'mostly', 'familiar', '2009', 'underappreciated', 'masterpiece', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'Bastian', 'recent', 'loss', 'mother', 'dissolved', 'innocence', 'finding', 'hard', 'function', 'reality', ""n't"", 'getting', 'support', 'own', 'father', 'move', 'not', 'something', 'easily', 'done', 'especially', 'child', 'essence', 'Bastian', 'own', 'father', 'forcing', 'grow', 'up', 'way', 'too', 'fast', 'Bastian', 'needs', 'remain', 'child', 'as', 'long', 'possible.What', 'struck', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'recent', 'viewing', 'was', 'religious', 'so', 'seem', 'tremors', 'streamline', 'films', 'core', 'conversation', 'Atreyu', 'evil', ""G'mork"", ""G'mork"", 'mentions', 'Nothing', 'destroy', 'hope', 'loss', 'hope', 'easier', 'control', 'people', 'When', 'thinking', 'war', 'God', 'Satan', 'film', 'quite', 'possibly', 'novel', 'was', 'attempting', 'illuminate', 'plight', 'Satan', 'influence', 'had', 'world', 'today', 'destroying', 'man', 'faith', 'stripped', 'away', 'hope', 'thus', 'made', 'easier', 'control', 'man.Wow', 'very', 'very', 'rarely', 'mention', 'religion', 'reviews', 'struck', 'so', 'powerfully', 'watching', 'film', 'felt', 'need', 'say', 'that.Casting', 'films', 'lyrical', 'intentions', 'aside', 'stunning', 'times', 'cinematography', 'exciting', 'flow', 'films', 'elements', 'make', 'great', 'adventure', 'story', 'still', 'up', 'today', 'Sure', 'not', 'as', 'polished', 'recent', 'fantasy', 'films', 'home', 'nostalgia', 'will', 'never', 'leave', 'Noah', 'Hathaway', 'performance', 'quite', 'terrible', 'Barret', 'Oliver', 'genuinely', 'fantastic', 'instantly', 'iconic', 'own', 'right.Watch', 'movie', 'love', 'minute']",The NeverEnding Story VHS

I truly love the mystic world full of such whimsical creatures such as multi-faced courtiers, a gigantic swamp  tortoise, a rock-eating giant, an eldery elfin couple, and so on forth.  Especially the flying white dragon that greatly resembles a big, friendly  puppy dog! In this film, a brave young boy being chased by school bullies  and having to put up with an indifferent dad secretly smuggles a  unusual-looking book out of an musty old bookstore. Then he hides in a  school closet to read all about &quot;himself&quot; as the hero setting out  on a great quest to save the dying world from the unseen evil. Imagine a  young child becoming quite enthralled by a real storybook, especially the  part where he cries over the death of the hero's horse deep in the depths  of a treacherous swampland. And there are also frightening parts  in this  imaginative yarn as well, yet it is still quite a welcome change for young  people being raised in the age of really gross and scary movies like  &quot;The Gremlins&quot; and &quot;The Blade Runner&quot;.

364314,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,6303212395,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[23, 26]","It came as quite a shock to American critics when Wolfgang Petersen, best-known for his direction of the gritty submarine drama 'Das Boot', chose a children's fantasy for his first American film. But The Neverending Story is a fanciful, engaging, and thoroughly enchanting fairy tale, and has become a bit of a classic of the genre!The story appears to be simple; a young boy named Bastian, withdrawn since his mother's death, and the target of local bullies, finds refuge in a magical book about a mythical world called Fantasia, filled with sweet and bizarre creatures, an ethereally beautiful Empress (played by the luminous Tami Stronach), and a young hero (Battlestar Galactica's Noah Hathaway) that he immediately relates to.What truly sets this film apart is its underlying message of 'What Is Real?' The characters of the story keep referring to Bastian, and how he must save their world. Bastian must learn to use his imagination, to let go of preconceptions of reality...and, ultimately, the viewer is given the same choice, as well, in one of the most novel twists I've seen in a film in a long time!Being produced by an international team, the film has a decidedly European 'feel', even with the participation of Gerald McRaney ('Simon and Simon', 'Major Dad') and the other American actors. Major pluses include the beautiful theme music, some terrific low-key creatures (I LOVED the giant flying dog!), and an approach to fantasy that is closer in spirit to 'The Princess Bride' than 'The Lord of the Rings'.While the DVD has a great 'look', it has virtually no special features; one hopes a 'Director's Cut' DVD might eventually be made! Also, be forewarned that various sequels to this film have been produced, that aren't NEARLY as good as the original. THIS IS THE ONE TO BUY!Treat your kids and yourself to a terrific tale!

And what a top notch DVD transition.  From the time the title tune fades in and the strikingly colorful clouds appear on the screen I was hooked once again with this little bit of childish magic.  This widescreen version is a first for me (I was too old, dismissing this when it originally came out and had to discover it on &quot;fit your screen&quot; cable).  Let me say I have no complaints about how the STORY looks or sounds.  Pay attention and you'll notice things you didn't before.  I was amazed at the shimmering scales on the luckdragon, the enormous size of Morla, the detail of Gmork in the confrontation scene (I thought he was just a head but there's legs and a body), all the wonderful little details in Urgl and Engywook's little house.  So much more too.  And let me say again that the color is amazing!  Very little artifacts or graininess.  And the soundtrack will fill your room with music!  The movie itself is incredible on DVD.  This is the only way to watch it!So is there anything I didn't like?  Well, I could complain about the lack of extras.  There is a &quot;making of&quot; section; but it's just a few paragraphs of text.  Informative, but sparse.  Commentary is one reason to buy a DVD version.  I'd like to know what ever happened to Noah Hathaway, Barret Oliver and the rest of the players.  Words from the director can really put a new twist on your impressions of a movie and how they did certain scenes (just watch TIME BANDITS with Terry Gilliam!  Great fun!).  But we don't get that here.  Then again the movie is not priced like a special edition so maybe that's in the future.  The theatrical trailer was a welcome extra (WB sometimes leaves that off too).Well, the STORY reminds me that I've been meaning to read LORD OF THE RINGS before the movie comes out...so...see you between the pages...",5,Time to escape!,999648000,"09 5, 2001",2001,1942,"['got', 'mail', 'today-earlier', 'expected', 'What', 'great', 'surprise', 'STORY', 'finally', 'DVD', 'what', 'top', 'notch', 'DVD', 'transition', 'time', 'title', 'tune', 'fades', 'strikingly', 'colorful', 'clouds', 'appear', 'screen', 'was', 'hooked', 'once', 'again', 'little', 'bit', 'childish', 'magic', 'widescreen', 'version', 'first', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'dismissing', 'when', 'originally', 'came', 'out', 'had', 'discover', 'quot', 'fit', 'screen', 'quot', 'cable', 'Let', 'say', 'have', 'complaints', 'how', 'STORY', 'Pay', 'attention', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'amazed', 'shimmering', 'scales', 'luckdragon', 'enormous', 'size', 'Morla', 'detail', 'Gmork', 'confrontation', 'scene', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'head', 'legs', 'body', 'wonderful', 'little', 'details', 'Urgl', 'Engywook', 'little', 'house', 'So', 'much', 'more', 'too', 'let', 'say', 'again', 'color', 'amazing', 'Very', 'little', 'artifacts', 'graininess', 'soundtrack', 'will', 'fill', 'room', 'music', 'movie', 'incredible', 'DVD', 'only', 'way', 'watch', 'So', 'anything', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Well', 'could', 'complain', 'lack', 'extras', 'quot', 'making', 'quot', 'section', 'just', 'few', 'paragraphs', 'text', 'Informative', 'sparse', 'Commentary', 'one', 'reason', 'buy', 'DVD', 'version', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'what', 'ever', 'happened', 'Noah', 'Hathaway', 'Barret', 'Oliver', 'rest', 'players', 'Words', 'director', 'can', 'really', 'put', 'new', 'twist', 'impressions', 'movie', 'how', 'did', 'certain', 'scenes', 'just', 'watch', 'TIME', 'BANDITS', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'Great', 'fun', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'here', 'Then', 'again', 'movie', 'not', 'priced', 'special', 'edition', 'so', 'maybe', 'future', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'was', 'welcome', 'extra', 'WB', 'sometimes', 'off', 'too', '.Well', 'STORY', ""'ve"", 'been', 'meaning', 'read', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', 'movie', 'out', 'so', 'see', 'pages']",The NeverEnding Story VHS

The imaginative character designs and enchanting environments bring the world of Fantasia to life in amazing detail. Director Wolfgang Petersen employs an astonishing array of special effects, from life-like puppets to matte paintings and miniatures that meld together to give the film an epic look unlike any other. Although it is based in childhood fantasy, the film touches on many darker tones and twisted villains that, along with its haunting score, often make for a frightening viewing experience for younger audiences. A series of meaningful and memorable characters are introduced to fight the forces of darkness, characters who personify the values of courage (found in the brave warrior Atreyu), wisdom (shown by the ancient one, Morla), and valor (as seen in the self-sacrifice made by The Rockbiter and others). In the face of such heroism, the corruptive creature that is attempting to destroy this whimsical world fares no chance. On top of the High Fantasy elements the film possesses, it also delivers a powerful message against the death of imagination at the hands of apathetic parents and their disenchanted children. By frequently breaking the fourth wall, THE NEVERENDING STORY engages young Bastian as well as the viewing audience to enter the world of Fantasia and participate in the events as they unfold on screen right beside Atreyu and his companions, thereby saving all who live within this realm. THE NEVERENDING STORY holds a special place beside other timeless classics like THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE DARK CRYSTAL, and LABYRINTH.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",5,The Neverending Story,1270857600,"04 10, 2010",2010,1706,"['NEVERENDING', 'STORY', 'feat', 'fantasy', 'filmmaking', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'incredible', 'fantasy', 'adventures', 'ever', 'made', 'imaginative', 'character', 'designs', 'enchanting', 'environments', 'bring', 'world', 'Fantasia', 'life', 'amazing', 'detail', 'Director', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'astonishing', 'array', 'special', 'effects', 'life-like', 'puppets', 'matte', 'paintings', 'miniatures', 'meld', 'together', 'give', 'film', 'epic', 'look', 'other', 'based', 'childhood', 'fantasy', 'film', 'touches', 'many', 'darker', 'tones', 'twisted', 'villains', 'haunting', 'score', 'often', 'make', 'frightening', 'viewing', 'experience', 'younger', 'audiences', 'series', 'meaningful', 'memorable', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'fight', 'forces', 'darkness', 'characters', 'who', 'personify', 'values', 'courage', 'found', 'brave', 'warrior', 'Atreyu', 'wisdom', 'shown', 'ancient', 'one', 'Morla', 'valor', 'seen', 'self-sacrifice', 'made', 'Rockbiter', 'others', 'face', 'such', 'heroism', 'corruptive', 'creature', 'attempting', 'destroy', 'whimsical', 'world', 'chance', 'top', 'High', 'Fantasy', 'film', 'possesses', 'also', 'powerful', 'message', 'death', 'imagination', 'hands', 'apathetic', 'parents', 'disenchanted', 'children', 'frequently', 'breaking', 'fourth', 'wall', 'THE', 'NEVERENDING', 'STORY', 'young', 'Bastian', 'as', 'well', 'viewing', 'audience', 'enter', 'world', 'Fantasia', 'participate', 'events', 'unfold', 'screen', 'right', 'beside', 'Atreyu', 'companions', 'thereby', 'saving', 'who', 'live', 'realm', 'NEVERENDING', 'STORY', 'special', 'place', 'other', 'timeless', 'classics', 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', 'THE', 'DARK', 'CRYSTAL', 'LABYRINTH.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",The NeverEnding Story VHS

But I researched it on the net, and apparently it's &quot;Moon Child.&quot; It does sound like that's what he's shouting. But I'm baffled that that was his mother's name (unless he changed his mind further into the film and decided to give the Empress a random name rather than his mother's).So overall, the movie's good and the DVD is so-so.

However, his knowledge of technical filmmaking and his passion for adventure stories proved to be the perfect combination, as can be seen in this campy classic 1984 film.The story concerns young Bastian, an imaginative boy who prefers to retreat into books rather than face the harsh truths of reality, as he borrows a magical book from a bookstore and reads it in the creepy attic of his school. All his life Bastian has been bullied by other kids at school and misunderstood by his overly practical widower of a father. But as Bastian's mind absorbs the details of the book, The NeverEnding Story, he finds both escapism and empowerment while reading of a heroic young hunter named Atreyu. Atreyu is a member of the Plainspeople and he was chosen to save his world, Fantasia (in the book the fantasy world is known as Fantastica), from the devastation of The Nothing, a living void which spreads across Fantasia devouring all in its path and leaving nothingness in its wake. As Bastian follows Atreyu's daring exploits, he becomes astonished to discover that Fantasia really exists and that he may be the only one who can save it from oblivion, so long as he finds the courage in himself to do as he dreams.Since the film's release, it has become something of a family classic, but after almost twenty-five years it's hard to imagine this film having the longevity of the fantasy classics that preceded it. The film is charming and entertaining, but it lacks the heart of films likeThe Wizard of OzandChitty Chitty Bang Bang, and lacks the sophistication of a film likeThe Dark Crystal. The film does, however, have some ingenious special effects and some truly bizarre costumes and make-ups, which are at time reminiscent of the firstStar Warsfilm.The plot itself deviates from that of the book, but does so in order to make the film accessible to the average viewer.With a wondrous array of characters and creatures including a Rock Biter, a racing snail, a fearsome wolf-like creature known as the Gmork, a Luck Dragon named Falkor, and the fragile and beautiful Childlike Empress, it's not hard to see why the film has such great appeal.Also recommended:LabyrinthThe Princess BrideWillowThe Pagemaster",4,"""We Are All Part of the NeverEnding Story""",1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,2412,"['German', 'director', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'man', 'responsible', 'harrowing', 'WWII', 'epicDas', 'Boot', 'may', 'seem', 'odd', 'choice', 'direct', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Michael', 'Ende', 'children', 'book', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'However', 'knowledge', 'technical', 'filmmaking', 'passion', 'adventure', 'stories', 'proved', 'be', 'perfect', 'combination', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'campy', 'classic', '1984', 'film.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'young', 'Bastian', 'imaginative', 'boy', 'who', 'retreat', 'books', 'rather', 'face', 'harsh', 'truths', 'reality', 'magical', 'book', 'bookstore', 'creepy', 'attic', 'school', 'life', 'Bastian', 'been', 'bullied', 'other', 'kids', 'school', 'misunderstood', 'overly', 'practical', 'widower', 'father', 'Bastian', 'mind', 'details', 'book', 'NeverEnding', 'Story', 'escapism', 'empowerment', 'reading', 'heroic', 'young', 'hunter', 'named', 'Atreyu', 'Atreyu', 'member', 'Plainspeople', 'was', 'chosen', 'save', 'world', 'Fantasia', 'book', 'fantasy', 'world', 'known', 'Fantastica', 'devastation', 'Nothing', 'living', 'void', 'Fantasia', 'devouring', 'path', 'leaving', 'nothingness', 'wake', 'Bastian', 'Atreyu', 'daring', 'exploits', 'astonished', 'discover', 'Fantasia', 'really', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'save', 'oblivion', 'so', 'long', 'courage', 'do', 'film', 'release', 'become', 'something', 'family', 'classic', 'almost', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'hard', 'imagine', 'film', 'having', 'longevity', 'fantasy', 'classics', 'preceded', 'film', 'charming', 'entertaining', 'heart', 'films', 'likeThe', 'Wizard', 'OzandChitty', 'Chitty', 'Bang', 'Bang', 'sophistication', 'film', 'likeThe', 'Dark', 'Crystal', 'film', 'however', 'have', 'ingenious', 'special', 'effects', 'truly', 'bizarre', 'costumes', 'make-ups', 'are', 'time', 'reminiscent', 'firstStar', 'Warsfilm.The', 'plot', 'book', 'so', 'order', 'make', 'film', 'accessible', 'average', 'viewer.With', 'wondrous', 'array', 'characters', 'creatures', 'including', 'Rock', 'Biter', 'racing', 'snail', 'fearsome', 'wolf-like', 'creature', 'known', 'Gmork', 'Luck', 'Dragon', 'named', 'Falkor', 'fragile', 'beautiful', 'Childlike', 'Empress', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'such', 'great', 'appeal.Also', 'recommended', 'LabyrinthThe', 'Princess', 'BrideWillowThe', 'Pagemaster']",The NeverEnding Story VHS

The majority of these children have also probably seen the film in some form of another.  Well, up until now, The Neverending Story has been one of the best flicks of all-time.  Since it's release on DVD, it has to be THE best flick of all-time.  For the most part, the premise is simple; it deals with the beautiful world of Fantasia and a boy named Bastien.  Many refer to this as &quot;The Ultimate Fantasy Movie&quot; and I most certainly agree to that claim.  This is indeed a movie where you can escape from reality and just let your thoughts go wild.  Nothing seems impossible in the world of Fantasia.  All of the characters would make great additions to ones 'circle of association.'  Who wouldn't want The Rock Bitter or Atreyu as friends, or even Falcor as a pet??  Just think about the possibilities!!  The DVD though, is a nice piece to any collection.  The disc is double-sided and contains a full-screen as well as a wide-screen verion, both of which are spectacular.  The theatrical trailer is a nice addition, and something I was quite happy to see.  Even the little tidbits of info about the movie and story are a nice touch.  This is most certainly a movie that anyone, either young, or younger (basically young or old) can enjoy alone, or even together.  It is, and will be a timeless classic for many years to come.

364358,A2198FZZMTJ38H,6303212395,D. Litton,"[20, 23]","Scoff if you will at the dated appearance and juvenile dialogue of &quot;The Neverending Story,&quot; but chances are, if you happen upon someone who has seen the film, your opinions will differ immensely. Based on the novel by Michael Ende, this highly imaginative and visually sumptuous fairy tale is nothing short of astounding, and certainly a step forward in the children's film genre in its time.Truth be told, there is nothing quite like this film, and while attempts at sequels have failed miserably, they are unable to hinder the effect it has on its viewers. It sticks with you, in your mind, from the opening theme song to the stunning visual effects and dark undertones that permeate the story's conflict.The film begins when a young boy is chased down the street and hides in a bookstore to evade his pursuants. Bastian is a small child, though highly educated and an enthusiatic reader, though his mother's recent death have caused his school grades to hinder and his relationship with his father to turn stale. Which is why his interest is peaked when he happens upon a book by the name of &quot;The Neverending Story,&quot; a large volume whose cover is enough to intrigue even the audience into sticking with the film.As Bastian begins reading the story, he is transported into the world of Fantasia, where a mysterious force known only as The Nothing is destroying this elegant land. Many citizens of Fantasia have made their way to the Ivory Tower to seek the help of the Empress, who is fatally ill. Only one can find a cure for her illness: Atreju, a preteen warrior of the plains people who is called upon to seek out and destroy The Nothing and save the Empress from death. This begins both of their journeys: Atreju's treck across the land to find some hope of saving the increasingly deteriorating land, and Bastian's realization that he is playing a much larger role in the events of the book than he dares to think about. Atreju learns that discovering the answers to his questions means looking inside himself, while the both of them must find the courage to face their fears and save Fantasia before it is too late.For many who see the film, the connectiveness between these two worlds will seem silly to the point of absurdity. But this is not a film for such a mindset: this is a children's fantasy film, a delightful deluge of important morals and values that children are instilled with at an early age. From courage and faith, to truth and heroism, these traditional values are effectively dispersed throughout, and succeed in conveying their messages.For those who enjoy out-of-this-world landscapes and breathtaking vistas, this is a real treat. Fantasia is a place of endless beauty, cut with settings of dismal terror. The Ivory Tower stands as a pinnacle of hope against the setting sun, while such places as the Swamps of Sadness and the Southern Oracle, are treacherous and foreboding. The Nothing is the centerpiece for the film's visual delights, shown in the form of storms and endless dark clouds.Parents should not miss letting their child in on &quot;The Neverending Story,&quot; which has a lasting impact like no other film of its kind. Wolfgang Petersen's first English-language film is a striking example of excellence, no matter how you look at it. The film itself may have an ending, but its final message and the memory it leaves is endless.",5,The ultimate fantasy film!,998870400,"08 27, 2001",2001,3395,"['Scoff', 'will', 'dated', 'appearance', 'juvenile', 'dialogue', 'quot', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'quot', 'chances', 'are', 'happen', 'someone', 'who', 'seen', 'film', 'opinions', 'will', 'differ', 'immensely', 'Based', 'novel', 'Michael', 'Ende', 'highly', 'imaginative', 'visually', 'sumptuous', 'fairy', 'tale', 'nothing', 'short', 'astounding', 'certainly', 'step', 'forward', 'children', 'film', 'genre', 'time.Truth', 'be', 'told', 'nothing', 'quite', 'film', 'attempts', 'sequels', 'have', 'failed', 'miserably', 'are', 'unable', 'hinder', 'effect', 'viewers', 'mind', 'opening', 'theme', 'song', 'stunning', 'visual', 'effects', 'dark', 'undertones', 'permeate', 'story', 'conflict.The', 'film', 'when', 'young', 'boy', 'chased', 'street', 'hides', 'bookstore', 'evade', 'pursuants', 'Bastian', 'small', 'child', 'though', 'highly', 'educated', 'enthusiatic', 'reader', 'mother', 'recent', 'death', 'have', 'caused', 'school', 'grades', 'hinder', 'relationship', 'father', 'turn', 'stale', 'Which', 'why', 'interest', 'peaked', 'when', 'book', 'name', 'quot', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'quot', 'large', 'volume', 'cover', 'enough', 'intrigue', 'even', 'audience', 'sticking', 'film.As', 'Bastian', 'reading', 'story', 'transported', 'world', 'Fantasia', 'where', 'mysterious', 'force', 'known', 'only', 'Nothing', 'destroying', 'elegant', 'land', 'Many', 'citizens', 'Fantasia', 'have', 'made', 'way', 'Ivory', 'Tower', 'seek', 'help', 'Empress', 'who', 'fatally', 'ill.', 'Only', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'cure', 'illness', 'Atreju', 'preteen', 'warrior', 'plains', 'people', 'who', 'called', 'seek', 'out', 'destroy', 'Nothing', 'save', 'Empress', 'death', 'journeys', 'Atreju', 'treck', 'land', 'find', 'hope', 'saving', 'increasingly', 'deteriorating', 'land', 'Bastian', 'realization', 'playing', 'much', 'larger', 'role', 'events', 'book', 'think', 'Atreju', 'discovering', 'answers', 'questions', 'looking', 'must', 'find', 'courage', 'face', 'fears', 'save', 'Fantasia', 'too', 'late.For', 'many', 'who', 'see', 'film', 'connectiveness', 'two', 'worlds', 'will', 'seem', 'silly', 'point', 'absurdity', 'not', 'film', 'mindset', 'children', 'fantasy', 'film', 'delightful', 'deluge', 'important', 'morals', 'values', 'children', 'are', 'instilled', 'early', 'age', 'courage', 'faith', 'truth', 'heroism', 'traditional', 'values', 'are', 'effectively', 'dispersed', 'succeed', 'conveying', 'messages.For', 'who', 'enjoy', 'out-of-this-world', 'landscapes', 'breathtaking', 'vistas', 'real', 'treat', 'Fantasia', 'place', 'endless', 'beauty', 'cut', 'settings', 'dismal', 'terror', 'Ivory', 'Tower', 'pinnacle', 'hope', 'setting', 'sun', 'such', 'places', 'Swamps', 'Sadness', 'Southern', 'Oracle', 'are', 'treacherous', 'foreboding', 'Nothing', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'visual', 'delights', 'shown', 'form', 'storms', 'endless', 'dark', 'clouds.Parents', 'should', 'not', 'miss', 'letting', 'child', 'quot', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'quot', 'lasting', 'impact', 'other', 'film', 'kind', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'first', 'English-language', 'film', 'striking', 'example', 'excellence', 'matter', 'how', 'look', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'ending', 'final', 'message', 'memory', 'endless']",The NeverEnding Story VHS

Thus he encounters ""The Neverending Story"" a book about Fantasia and its fight against ""The Nothing"" an entity which is making the land and its people disappear. There he reads about Atreyu the warrior (Noah Hathaway) and his efforts to save the princess and the empire of Fantasia. Sounds like your typical children fare. But its in its execution an non-linear development where it succeeds. The creators where not afraid to introduce heavier elements into the story, Artax fate in the mud still remains one of the saddest things I seen. It also means that small children will likely be terrified by some of the creatures and scenarios displayed here. Like a pair of towering statues killing a man for simply walking between them. But that's what is cool about it I think, its not simply about looking at the pretty unicorns but sometimes you also need something truly threatening in order to spark your interest and emotions and after all is also about facing your fears and rising to the occasion. The Neverending Story makes us wonder, frightened, care. Because like Bastian at the end even though we have lived a fantasy the feelings felt were real. As a kid I used to watch it religiously every time it would air on TV and now as an adult revisiting it again in glorious HD quality is re-discovering it all over again. Not only I am able to see the details on every creature I never saw before but I'm again completely immersed into the story. I have to say that the special effects here are amazing.

364389,ACKDSX71VI5HY,6303212395,"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader""","[2, 2]","SPOILERS FOLLOW""The Neverending Story"" is a 1984 fantasy film from director Wolfgang Petersen.  Loosely adapted from Michael Ende's book of the same name(in its English translation from the original German), it stars Barret Oliver and Noah Hathaway.The movie tells the story of Bastian Bux(Oliver) and his compelling imaginative and psychological connection to the mythical land of Fantasia.  After essentially stealing the title tome from a grumpy and strange bookstore proprietor, Bastian reads it alone in a school attic as his fertile mind devours the odd story.  Arguably no other film makes such an effective, all-encompassing statement regarding the pyschological and emotional connection between readers and their books.  Noah Hathaway delivers a richly nuanced performance as the child warrior Atreyu, called on to save Fantasia from the murderous grasp of The Nothing.  The concept and function of The Nothing as detailed in the movie is extremely imaginative, and occasionally potentially very frightening for young children.Produced in an era before widespread computer-generated effects in movies, the wild landscapes of Fantasia are still extremely impressive.

364396,AV56CQTOGFTCJ,6303212395,Incredible Fulk,"[4, 4]","What can you say about Wolfgang Peterson's Neverending Story? To me, it defines childhood memories and 80's fantasy films.It's about a young imaginative book reader Bastian played by Barret Oliver, who runs into a small libary while escaping from some bullies. In there, he finds a book known as ""The Neverending Story"" which was being read by the cranky libarian who forbids Bastian from reading it. Bastian being both curious and interested decides to borrow the book. From here, Bastian reads the book while hiding in the school's attic. As Bastian reads, he learns that the book is telling the tale of the fantasy world of Fantasia which is being destoryed by a myserious force known as The Nothing. The people of Fantasia look to The Childlike Empress played by Tami Stronach for help. However, she has fallen deathly ill due to the presence of the Nothing. Now, the only hope lays in the hands of the young warrior Atreyu played by Noah Hathaway who must find a cure for The Empress before The Nothing destorys Fantasia.Watching this film is like watching Star Wars. The world of Fantasia is a highly imagintive world with it's own uniqe characters and creatures. This is WAY before the time of CG and when people used puppets and costumes to create this incredible world. Just like Star Wars, every character is unforgetable in this film. Falkor, the wise and optimistic luck dragon is easily the film's most memorable character. Who else as a kid wanted to go flying on Falkor's back? The voice by Alan Oppenheimer (best known for the voice of Skeletor in He-Man)is fantasic and it helps bring the character to life. My personal favorite character from this film is The Rock Bitter, the kindly rock eating giant. Everytime I see him, my childhood flashes before my eyes. Of course, this movie wouldn't be much without an evil character like Gmork. The evil wolf, hired by The Nothing to track down and kill Atreyu before he can find a cure. Gmork's green eyes and evil presence makes him a truly scary character in a child friendly film. I could spend this whole review talking about the characters like Morla, Nighthob and Teeny Weeny. But that would take foever. Besides the characters, another key element of this film is the settings, from the school's dark attic to the gloomy Swaps of Sadness help charaterize this film. The music by Klaus Doldinger is simply fantasic. Bastian's Happy Flight is the true theme of nostalgia. This film also has it's fair share of sad moments, such as the death of Atreyu's horse which still gets me into tears. The camera work is also a very big strong point. A perfect example would be the scene in which Gmork is catching on to Atreyu in the Swamps of Sadness. That scene is a true gripping moment for both the viewers and the characters.So overall, if your looking for a true fantasy film of the 80's, this is king of them all.

The plot is relatively simple and imaginative, and the inhabitants of Fantasia (the boundless country depicted in the story) are kid-friendly and enjoyable. I'm not so sure it would have much impact at all on a teenager or adult, though. I, like many people, sawe this when I was in elementary school, and I used to rent it all the time. Recently I found the DVD version and decided it would be fun to revisit the movie.So here's the pressing question: is this movie worth revistiting when you're older? The end is. Tami Stronach did an EXCELLENT job as the Empress- I almost cried. Noah Hathaway is pretty good too, playing Atreyu, the brave warrior. Plus, the music is good. Nothing like a good instrumental score... but I don't think it quite lived up to the extreme excitement I felt right before watching it.One last note: before you watch the movie, watch the Theatrical Trailer- which is really the only special feature on the DVD. The trailer does a better job of creating excitement and organizing scenes than the actual movie. I always thought the movie wasn't detailed enough; for example, they would say something like &quot;Atreyu traveled far and wide to find the cure for the Empress&quot; and they would show Atreyu galloping through the desert, but no more detail. They were, however, amazingly focused on his scene with the really slow turtle.In short: you might enjoy it, you might not.

The Never Ending Story, based on the book by German author Michael Ende, was the pinnacle of children's fantasy filmaking in the 80's and in many ways superior to its contemporaries The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth. The special effects, however dated, were state of the art at the time and can still move audiences.But what is most impressive is the imagination behind the world of The Never Ending Story. Fantasia is as wonderful a land to visit as Middle-Earth or Oz. With its assortment of fairyland creatures and engaging storyline, it's no wonder that this film has gone on to become a classic. So much thought and care went into designing this film that you won't even be able to forget the catchy theme song performed by 80's rock star Limahl.In The Never Ending Story, a young boy named Bastian (Barret Oliver) discovers a mysterious book with a strange emblem on the cover in an antique book shop. The book is called The Never Ending Story. Bastian decides to cut class and hide in his school's attic so that he can read the book undisturbed. Here Bastian follows the adventures of a young warrior boy called Atreyu (Noah Hathaway). However, Bastian soon learns that this mysterious book is aware of his every action. Bastian does not know that he is a part of The Never Ending Story which is taking place in real time even as he reads it. Bastian will have to come to grips with the recent death of his mother as well as the fact that he is the only one who can save Fantasia and the Childlike Princess (Tami Stronach) from the terrible Nothing which is threatening to destroy it.The Never Ending Story is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Wolfgang Petersen and composed by Klaus Doldinger.

Above anything else it teaches children what a wonderful gift of reading can do for the imagination and how important reading is. The story takes us through an oridinary world of Bastian, who's having trouble in life with the recent death of his mother. And his father who wants him to put both feet on the ground and stop living in the clouds. However, when Bastian is being chased by bully's from school he finds a bookstore that has a rather thick but interesting cover. The bookstores owner warns him its not your typical book and that he couldn't have it. However, he steals it and then finds himself in the school's attick. He finds himself soon lost in an adventure of The Neverending Story. Which the book is about a land being destroyed by The Nothing. As Sabastian is being led on the adventure following another young boy in hopes to save Fantasia and it's people, named Atrial. When all along it's only Bastian who can save them.This movie has everything you could possibly want in a fantisy. It's full of adventure, special effects, and all through a little boy that is using his adventure through a not so ordinary book. This show's how important again it is for kids to read, and to use their imaginations, and what books can do to take you on a realistic adventure. It's amazing and I call it a classic as well as millions of other fan's across the world.The DVD is pretty good, the sound seemed a bit faded but its a pretty good DVD. Only thing is it doesn't give you the opition to have it full screen like some of them do. However, it's got Notes and Trivia on the book and characters, interactive menus, theatrical trailer, and language selections.All in all a great buy you won't be sorry.

364470,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,6303212395,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[189, 208]","In 1994, Wolfgang Petersen directed the film adaptation of the German novel ""Die Unendliche Geschichte"", which was written by Michael Ende (1929-1995).  The film/novel is better known in the U.S. with its English title of ""The Neverending Story"".  It was also the first film that Wolfgang Petersen filmed in English.  The story begins with a troubled boy named Bastian (Barret Oliver), who is being raised by his father (Gerald McRaney).  An avid reader with an active imagination, Bastian walks into a used bookstore owned by Mr. Koreander (Thomas Hill) and finds a mysterious book that captures his curiosity.  Mr. Koreander seemingly doesn't want to sell the book to him, but Bastian manages to run from the store with book in hand.  Bastian takes the book to school with him, where he is tormented by three bullies (Drum Garrett, Darryl Cooksey & Nicholas Gilbert).  To avoid the bullies, Bastian finds refuge in a rarely-used attic within the school and begins to read from the book about a magical land called Fantasia.  Fantasia is a wonderful place with many unusual characters and is ruled by the Childlike Princess (Tami Stronach), but something terrible is happening to Fantasia as parts of it are disappearing by an unknown force referred to only as ""the nothing"".  The Childlike Princess calls upon the strongest warrior to find a human child to stop ""the nothing"".  The warrior, a boy named Atreyu (Noah Hathaway) of a tribe similar to Native Americans, takes the protective signet that the Childlike Princess gives to him and sets off to find a human child, which can only be found beyond the bounds of Fantasia.  To his astonishment, as Bastian reads the book and the many adventures, challenges and dangers and Atreyu faces, Bastian slowly begins to realize whom Atreyu and the Childlike Princess are actually seeking.With imaginative characters, good cinematography & special effects and an endearing & well-written story, ""The Neverending Story"" is a wonderful and engaging film that not only captures Bastian's imagination in the story, but the audience's imagination as well.  Other memorable characters in the film include Teeny Weeny (Deep Roy), Night Hob (Tilo Pr&uuml;ckner), Cairon (Moses Gunn), Engywook (Sydney Bromley), Urgl (Patricia Hayes), Falkor (voice of Alan Oppenheimer), Rock Biter, the Racing Snail and the Bat. Overall, I rate ""The Neverending Story"" with 5 out of 5 stars and very highly recommend it to both young & old alike.  It's a wonderful film that can be watched time and again without becoming tiresome.  Sadly, the film's two sequels (produced in 1990 & 1994) were far less memorable.  Other films directed by Wolfgang Petersen include ""Das Boot"" (1981), ""Enemy Mine"" (1985), ""The Perfect Storm"" (2000) and ""Troy"" (2004).",5,"""He is very close, listening to every word we say.""",1098748800,"10 26, 2004",2004,2771,"['1994', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'directed', 'film', 'adaptation', 'German', 'novel', 'Die', 'Unendliche', 'Geschichte', 'was', 'written', 'Michael', 'Ende', '1929-1995', 'film/novel', 'better', 'known', 'U.S.', 'English', 'title', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'was', 'also', 'first', 'film', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'filmed', 'English', 'story', 'troubled', 'boy', 'named', 'Bastian', 'Barret', 'Oliver', 'who', 'being', 'raised', 'father', 'Gerald', 'McRaney', 'avid', 'reader', 'active', 'imagination', 'Bastian', 'walks', 'used', 'bookstore', 'owned', 'Mr.', 'Koreander', 'Thomas', 'Hill', 'mysterious', 'book', 'curiosity', 'Mr.', 'Koreander', 'seemingly', ""n't"", 'want', 'sell', 'book', 'Bastian', 'manages', 'run', 'store', 'book', 'hand', 'Bastian', 'book', 'school', 'where', 'tormented', 'three', 'bullies', 'Drum', 'Garrett', 'Darryl', 'Cooksey', 'Nicholas', 'Gilbert', 'avoid', 'bullies', 'Bastian', 'finds', 'refuge', 'rarely-used', 'attic', 'school', 'read', 'book', 'magical', 'land', 'called', 'Fantasia', 'Fantasia', 'wonderful', 'place', 'many', 'unusual', 'characters', 'ruled', 'Childlike', 'Princess', 'Tami', 'Stronach', 'something', 'terrible', 'happening', 'Fantasia', 'parts', 'are', 'disappearing', 'unknown', 'force', 'referred', 'only', 'nothing', 'Childlike', 'Princess', 'strongest', 'warrior', 'find', 'human', 'child', 'stop', 'nothing', 'warrior', 'boy', 'named', 'Atreyu', 'Noah', 'Hathaway', 'tribe', 'similar', 'Native', 'Americans', 'protective', 'signet', 'Childlike', 'Princess', 'sets', 'off', 'find', 'human', 'child', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'found', 'bounds', 'Fantasia', 'astonishment', 'Bastian', 'book', 'many', 'adventures', 'challenges', 'dangers', 'Atreyu', 'Bastian', 'slowly', 'realize', 'whom', 'Atreyu', 'Childlike', 'Princess', 'are', 'actually', 'seeking.With', 'imaginative', 'characters', 'good', 'cinematography', 'special', 'effects', 'endearing', 'well-written', 'story', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'wonderful', 'engaging', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'Bastian', 'imagination', 'story', 'audience', 'imagination', 'as', 'well', 'Other', 'memorable', 'characters', 'film', 'include', 'Teeny', 'Weeny', 'Deep', 'Roy', 'Night', 'Hob', 'Tilo', 'Pr', 'uuml', 'ckner', 'Cairon', 'Moses', 'Gunn', 'Engywook', 'Sydney', 'Bromley', 'Urgl', 'Patricia', 'Hayes', 'Falkor', 'voice', 'Alan', 'Oppenheimer', 'Rock', 'Biter', 'Racing', 'Snail', 'Bat', 'Overall', 'rate', 'Neverending', 'Story', '5', '5', 'stars', 'very', 'highly', 'recommend', 'young', 'old', 'alike', 'wonderful', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'time', 'again', 'becoming', 'tiresome', 'Sadly', 'film', 'two', 'sequels', 'produced', '1990', '1994', 'were', 'far', 'less', 'memorable', 'Other', 'films', 'directed', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'include', 'Das', 'Boot', '1981', 'Enemy', 'Mine', '1985', 'Perfect', 'Storm', '2000', 'Troy', '2004']",The NeverEnding Story VHS
364471,A2FT65RZEV2HNH,6303212395,Michael Cavacini,"[0, 0]","Last night I decided to revisit one of my favorite films as a child: The Neverending Story. I was a little nervous that the movie wouldn't be as good as I remembered, but thankfully it was. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen, this 1984 film was met with mostly positive reviews upon its release. While the film grossed less in the U.S. than it cost to make, worldwide it pulled in more than $100 million and went on to become one of the best-selling home video releases ever.The Neverending Story is based on the first half of the fantasy novel of the same name by Michael Ende. While I plan on reading the novel, I have yet to do so; therefore I can't compare the two. However, nearly 30 years later, the movie is still as visually stunning as I remember. Watching Atreyu traverse Fantasia in search of a way to save the Empress, was as spellbinding as I remembered. And the wonderfully majestic score, composed by Klaus Doldinger, brought back great memories, as well as the title song, which was composed by legendary disco producer Giorgio Moroder.If you've never seen this movie, I highly recommend it. While some of the special effects look dated, the majority of them are still wonderful. More importantly, the acting is excellent and the story is charming. It's a wonderful film for those young and old, and it still ranks high on my list of all-time favorite films.",5,A Classic That Still Holds Up,1367884800,"05 7, 2013",2013,1369,"['Last', 'night', 'decided', 'revisit', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'child', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'was', 'little', 'nervous', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'good', 'remembered', 'thankfully', 'was', 'Directed', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', '1984', 'film', 'was', 'met', 'mostly', 'positive', 'reviews', 'release', 'film', 'grossed', 'less', 'U.S.', 'cost', 'make', 'worldwide', 'pulled', 'more', '100', 'million', 'went', 'become', 'one', 'best-selling', 'home', 'video', 'ever.The', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'based', 'first', 'half', 'fantasy', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Michael', 'Ende', 'plan', 'reading', 'novel', 'have', 'yet', 'do', 'so', 'therefore', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'However', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'later', 'movie', 'still', 'visually', 'stunning', 'remember', 'Watching', 'Atreyu', 'traverse', 'Fantasia', 'search', 'way', 'save', 'Empress', 'was', 'as', 'spellbinding', 'remembered', 'wonderfully', 'majestic', 'score', 'composed', 'Klaus', 'Doldinger', 'brought', 'back', 'great', 'memories', 'as', 'well', 'title', 'song', 'was', 'composed', 'legendary', 'disco', 'producer', 'Giorgio', 'Moroder.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'special', 'effects', 'look', 'dated', 'majority', 'are', 'still', 'wonderful', 'More', 'importantly', 'acting', 'excellent', 'story', 'charming', 'wonderful', 'film', 'young', 'old', 'still', 'high', 'list', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'films']",The NeverEnding Story VHS

If you didn't see it when it first came out (and if you weren't between the ages of 5-10) then the magic will be difficult to grasp.  Which is the irony of the movie. It's about imagination disappearing, and people forgetting to dream and remember what it was like to be a kid.Nevertheless, it is a good movie.  The wolf might scare the kids, I remember it being rather spooky when I saw it at the age of 8.  And of course, the effects are. . . ohhh, slightly dated, but they hold up.  The only thing that simply STINKS about this DVD release is the lack of extras, (I guess we could call it the Nothing).  Because it has none.  Big disappointment.  Where is the cast and crew?  Why didn't the director put in some time with this movie and give us a commentary, or behind the scenes, or even cut scenes?  Wasn't this a classic. . . ?  As far as I know the director hasn't been up to too much lately.  It's a shame, it's a classic for those who grew up in the 80's, it did leave it's mark culturally, and I'm surpised nobody from the cast/crew decided to do anything for it when it released.  It may have DVD quality, but not the quantity.  I only paid 10 bucks for it, so, in the long run it was worth it.In the meantime, if you want just a movie purely for imagination, then buy it for your kids.

Noah did his own stunts as well.The most asked question is: What is the name Bastion yelled out?The part that touched me the most was when the Rock Biter told of how weak he really was, even though he looked strong.  We are all like that, no matter what happens in our lives.  As many times as I've watched this movie, I always tear up at this part.The color and photography are SO wonderful.I will be 59 in a week and I can't see myself EVER tiring of it.

I still have the old VHS tape that I have to have half-worn out by now, but &quot;The Never-Ending Story&quot; is still as entrancing and as luminous as it was when I was four years old.  The film focuses on the paralell journies of of Sebastian, a shy and reclusive child in a modern-day metropolis who steals a book from a library while being chased by local bullies.  Once safe in a old dingy attic, he begins reading of a fantastic land called Fantasia, a world made from the hopes and dreams of every human.  In this story (Called the &quot;Never-Ending Story&quot;) as young human boy named Atreyu is called on by the dying Empress of Fantasia to find a way to stop the Nothing.  The nothing is best described as a dense, pitch-black cloud but it represents far more.  It destroys anything in Fantasia it comes in contact with the broken hopes, dreams and spirits of human beings.  Atreyu is sent on this mission to stop it before all of Fantasia is destroyed.Sebastian follows his quest, as do we.  And what we see are incredible visual effects, utilizing artful production design, make-up and convincing puppet-work that makes memorable and instantly connectable fairy-tale characters.  For one there is the huge flying dog that Atreyu befriends, a giant being made from rock, the minature professor and his wife and especially that menacing black wolf who aids the nothing.  Even though I have discovered other unnerving and disturbing movie villians over the years (Hannibal Lector, Michael Myers) that wolf, named Gemork, is still one of the most menacing and frightening characters I have ever seen put to the screen.  Gemork may have only a few minutes total of time on the screen, but he is still makes an impact with a low, growly tone and an indifference to anything in Fantasia that  gets destroyed.And ample credit must be given to director Wolfgang Peterson, who until &quot;The Never-Ending Story&quot; was internationally known for his WWll submarine drama &quot;Das Boot,&quot; and some people were very surprised to learn that his first english languange film was a childrens' fantasy.  But Mr. Peterson knew what he was doing.  That same keen sense of character, pace and story that he has brought to films like &quot;Das boot,&quot; and &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; is still very evident here.  He uses the stunning visuals to full effect and fleshes out the theme-filled story well.

The hardships that have befallen his life, along with the hard instruction of an out-of-touch father, have taken their toll on Bastian's ability to fantasize and dream, convincing him that he must grow up and keep his feet on the ground. Luckily for him, while taking refuge in an old bookshop one day on his way to school, Bastian is introduced to ""The NeverEnding Story"". This mysterious book takes his imagination on a daring quest with a young warrior named Atreyu to save a child-like empress and the entire land of Fantasia from the mysterious and terrible Nothing that is sweeping across the land and destroying everything it touches.If any movies from the now much celebrated 1980's can truly be called classics, ""The NeverEnding Story"" is without a doubt one of the most worthy. It was a time when fantasy films for young people were insanely popular, all with dazzling pre-CGI effects and eerie, otherworldly music, and this film is the finest example.  Based on a famous German book (it's said that the author was not pleased with the film version), ""The NeverEnding Story"" is an exciting and magical tale about the restoration of a boy's imagination against great odds. The land and creatures of Fantasia, while sometimes rather ugly, are brilliantly brought to life, the cast is excellent, and every young boy growing up in the '80's was totally in love with beautiful Tami Stronach as the empress (now a lovely and accomplished dancer). We all also wanted a luck dragon of our own!The Warner Bros. DVD release could use an update, as all the extras are in the form of text information (little tidbits about the characters and effects), but at least the film is presented in widescreen (on the flip side) and a trailer is included as well. There were two sequels made to ""The NeverEnding Story"", plus a cartoon series and something called ""Tales from the NeverEnding Story,"" which I believe was a live-action TV series.

In fact, I was probably a lot like Bastian, really getting into the story and living it, and it felt like it went on for ages as you traveled with the characters.  As an adult, my first reaction was ""wow, is the movie over already?""  It just went so much faster and while it still had charm, I couldn't believe the different perspective I had.Bastian lives with his father after the death of his mother.  A small boy and quiet by nature, he is often the target of bullies.  It is on one day, when he is running from said bullies, that he stumbles into a store where an old man shows him a mysterious book called The Neverending Story.  Knowing he has to read it, Bastian slips out of the shop with the book (but assures the owner in a note he'll bring it back) and takes it to school.  There in the attic, he starts to read the book and becomes a part of a world called Fantasia, where the nothingness is taking over and the empress is dying and only a young boy named Atreyu can help save it.  But to do so he must go on a dangerous journey, where his wit and skills will be tested.Characters:Barret Oliver: Bastian BuxNoah Hathaway: AtreyuTami Stronach: The EmpressAlan Oppenheimer: Falkor, Gmork, Rock Biter and the NarratorMoses Gunn: CaironSydney Bromley: EngywookI don't really remember caring either way about Bastian as a child.

Hathaway as Atreyu was quite good too.  He had to do a lot of different things in the movie and he pulled them off admirably.  He had the right amount of spunk that brave Atreyu needed as well.  The only other character that got a ton of screen time was Falkor and since he was a dragon, his voice was appropriately deep and commanding (as done by Oppenheimer).  He's a likable dragon though, with a certain jovialness to him that's appealing.  The other characters are all neat, but they play small roles and in my opinion, not used to the best of their abilities.  But they do paint the picture for what Fantasia is like.This is an adventure movie.  It's based off of a book (which I have not yet read but will eventually) and I can't really say how well it follows the book.  I'm assuming well since it seems like the author had a big hand in how the movie was made.  As said before though, while this movie went slowly as a child, it moves very very fast as an adult.  Almost rushed.  So as much as I would like to give it the highest rating, there are some flaws there that nostalgia just can't fix for me.  This is a kids movie, and it's appropriate for kids, however, there are some very hard themes that are expressed in it.  Loss, violence, sorrow; just to name a few.For being made in the eighties, this movie had some decent special effects.  The dragon Falkor alone was well done and lifelike, and even a bit scary for a young child.  Likewise the other characters had neat costumes.  The only thing I really found hokey would be the castle in the end, it was just a little out there.  But really, well done.  And then there's the music.  Epic music, I loved all of it.  Mainly because it brought back memories but there's just something so catchy about it all, and it was written specifically for the movie so it's very fitting as well.This movie brings back a lot of memories, and while it's not quite what I remembered it's still very good.  It's one of those movies that all ages will like too so it's a good one for family night.  Enjoy this jewel!Review by M.

364493,A15W70BFY26KIA,6303212395,Mr Ghostface,"[23, 24]","&quot;Die Unendliche Geschichte&quot;Released in 1984, this movie is perhaps the best of the classic 80s fantasy resurgence. Along with The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth and Ridley Scott's Legend, The Neverending Story lets us all escape from reality for a while.This film, however, rises above others in its genre by offering a somewhat postmodern examination of the desires and needs for escape from everyday life. Drawing comparisons between Bastian's storybook readings and our own cinema-going, the film ultimately condones such escapist daydreaming - disapproved of by Bastian's father early in the movie - and offers us hope that if we follow those dreams with all our heart, we will achieve them.Visually stunning with Ul de Rico's inimitable production design, and directed with a beautifully non-Hollywood flare by German director Wolfgang Petersen, The Neverending Story is a film to be not only enjoyed but cherished. On the surface it's an exhiliarating fantasy ride, below it's an examination of the childhood daydreams most of us have given up on or forgotten. Relive them.All the leads are strong, with some brilliant supporting performances from actors and creatures alike. Followed by George 'Mad Max' Miller's sequel in 1990, which was watchable but suffered from the lead-cast changes (unavoidable as the original actors were hitting twenty), and an abysmal third installment in 1994, which should be avoided at all costs.NOTE: This review was written just prior to the release of the DVD version. I hope Warners give the film the treatment it deserves - no film with $27m of production design in it goes without supplementary material. There are two versions of the film, the German version containing Klaus Doldinger's complete score and lacking Giorgio Moroder's memorable theme song.

I didn't know there was a book, and that the movie only adapts the first half of it.  I have ordered both the paperback and hardcover.  I found a handmade leather dust cover on Etsy that goes with the hardcover book so it looks very close to what it looks like in the movie.  There is a $200 edition of the book here on Amazon, but it's not that accurate.  I really wish someone would make an accurate replica of the book seen in the movie.  I would pay hundreds for it.Anyway, the movie is a masterpiece on its own.  I was hesitant to watch it, as I didn't want to ruin the fond memories I had of it as a child.  But, surprisingly, it was great.  The message of the importance of hope and imagination were what I got from it for the first time, as I was only 12 years old or so the last time I watched it.  Einstein would be proud lolTruly a classic movie.  It's a crying shame that the sequels are straight garbage.  I tried watching The Neverending Story II for free on Amazon Prime (heads up Amazon Prime members, if you can stomach that terrible movie), but could only get about halfway before me and the wife looked at each other and agreed that we couldn't keep watching.  It was that bad.  So, I'm excited to read the book.  I want to know the rest of Bastian's story!Now, onto the Bluray itself.  It's not the best of picture quality, but not bad by any means.  Some scenes are worse than others.  There is a menu but no special features.  The options are: Play, Language, Scenes.  That's it.  It's been nearly 30 years since the theatrical release, so it would be nice to get a 30th Anniversary edition with commentaries and other extras.

Fisher ""Ravenya""","[12, 13]","This movie's release was unfortunatly overshadowed by the release of E.T., and so many missed out on this incredible movie that is one of the rare movies that actually improves on the original novel (although Micheal Ende would probably disagree).Bastian is a young boy, still grieving from the death of his mother, struggling in his relationship with his father, suffering from nightmares, and mercilessly bullied by fellow school students. To escape from this unhappy existence, he surrounds himself with books, and one day when escaping the local bullies hides in an old bookshop belonging to the mysterious Mr Koreander. Using the ole' reverse psychology treatment, the old man entices Bastian to run off with a large book, intrigingly titled 'The Neverending Story'. Hiding himself in the school's storage room, Bastian begins to read of the land of Fantasia, which draws him deeper and deeper into it's story as he reads of the young hero Atreyu and his quest to find a cure for the seriously ill Child-Like Empress to stop the mysterious Nothing that is swallowing up the land.What follows is an incredible journey of adventure, magic, imagination and faith that the two boys face - Atreyu by experiencing them, Bastian by reading them - helped by Falcor the luck dragon, the gnomes Engwok and Urgl and the giant Rock-Biter, and hindered by the ever-growing Nothing and the wolf-like G'Mork. By the conclusion, we not only learn the (rather startling) true natures of both Fantasia and the Nothing, but are left with some pretty important issues to think about such as the importance of the imagination, the need faith in one's self and reinforcing the idea that just one person can make a difference.A few minor gripes with the story is that the rocky relationship between Bastian and his father is not properly resolved or explored, though it is implied that they eventually reconcile. Also, after the climax in the Ivory Tower, Atreyu unfortunatly drops from the action. True, his role in the story was completed, and the spotlight has to fall on Bastian, but it would have been nice to of had a scene with both Atreyu and Bastian who share their adventure together.The three children actors are utterly outstanding - Noah Hathaway as the heroic and innocent Atreyu, Barret Oliver as the Bastian who manages to be hopeful and despairing at the same time, and the stunning Tami Stronach as the Child-Like Empress, who never fails to make an impression as Atreyu nervously approaches her in the Ivory Tower. Adult actors back up the child stars nicely, and even the special effect characters such as Falcor, the Rock Biter and Morga come across as real characters, capable of real emotion.Even though this movie is getting on in years, it undoubtably holds up to today's standards. The many characters such as Falcor, the Racing Snail, the Bat, the Rock Biter and the chilling G'Mork (who still makes me shiver every time he says -""People who have no hopes or dreams are easy to control"") are flawless. Sets such as the Swamp, the Ivory Tower, Engwok's cave and the Sphinx are also still as fresh as they were on their original release - although they used the same figures for the Southern Oracle as they did for the Sphinx, only changed the color - slack!Lastly, the soundtrack is beautiful, and the song 'The Neverending Story' is perhaps the best song written for a movie.My enthusiastic ravings are no doubt due to the fact that this movie featured dominantly in my childhood - it partly helped along my love of books, and remains one of my all-time favourite movies. Hopefully I haven't over-hyped it for you, but it's truely a great film that you don't have to be a kid to enjoy, and can learn more from each time you watch it.Note: Avoid the sequels at all costs - they are appalling.

364521,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6303212395,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[6, 16]","The Neverending Story (Wolfgang Petersen, 1984)All we in America knew of Wolfgang Petersen in 1984 was Das Boot. How were we to know that it was completely out of character? His followup, The Neverending Story (and a smattering of films since, e.g. In the Line of Fire) have shown that Petersen has a far more absurd air than the brilliant, but relentlessly depressing, Das Boot would have us believe.The Neverending Story takes that sense of the absurd to its logical conclusion. Thankfully, Petersen had snapped back to something resembling reality by the time he made the film after this, 1985's Enemy Mine. But for The Neverending Story, Petersen pretty much cut himself loose from anything anchoring him to the earth and took off in a flight of fantasy that is, at the very least, a little disturbing.Someone wiser than I once said of such films that ""if you see them when you're eight years old, they'll be great forever, but if you see them for the first time in high school or older, you just don't get it."" (Thus, the continuing popularity of The Goonies has finally been explained.) I was in high school when The Neverending Story came out, so I guess my reaction wasn't much of a surprise. It was fun for what it was, though readers of Michael Ende's novel are likely to feel cheated and those with even a shred of subtlety are going to be beating themselves over the head for the movie's final twenty minutes.Barret Oliver (D. A. R. Y. L., Frankenweenie) stars as Bastian, who spends his time getting picked on in school and listening to his father (Gerald McRaney, years away from Major Dad fame) talk about how awful it is to have an imagination. While running from the school bullies, he stumbles into a bookshop owned by a rather odd chap named Koreander (Thomas Hill, who played the president in The Nude Bomb, the Get Smart movie). He secures a book from Koreander whose plot is, in essence, the rest of the film (save the merciless moralizing at the end).Despite said merciless moralizing, some of the things the beginning of the film imparts to the viewer are that it's okay to steal stuff from stores as long as you leave a note saying you're going to give it back, it's okay to cut school as long as you have something better to do, and that no matter how long you stay away, no one will come looking for you. (Is it a spoiler to say part of the end's moral is that these actions have no consequences?)I'm sure those who were slightly younger when this came out have a decidedly different take on it, but take the advice of my ever-so-wise friend. If you haven't already seen it, you're going to sit there at the end wondering what all the fuss was about. **",2,If you don't already have the magic...,1075766400,"02 3, 2004",2004,2680,"['Neverending', 'Story', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', '1984', 'America', 'knew', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', '1984', 'was', 'Das', 'Boot', 'How', 'were', 'know', 'was', 'completely', 'character', 'followup', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'smattering', 'films', 'e.g', 'Line', 'Fire', 'have', 'shown', 'Petersen', 'far', 'more', 'absurd', 'air', 'brilliant', 'relentlessly', 'depressing', 'Das', 'Boot', 'would', 'have', 'believe.The', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'sense', 'absurd', 'logical', 'conclusion', 'Thankfully', 'Petersen', 'had', 'snapped', 'back', 'something', 'resembling', 'reality', 'time', 'made', 'film', '1985', 'Enemy', 'Mine', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'Petersen', 'pretty', 'much', 'cut', 'loose', 'anything', 'anchoring', 'earth', 'took', 'off', 'flight', 'fantasy', 'very', 'least', 'little', 'disturbing.Someone', 'wiser', 'once', 'said', 'such', 'films', 'see', 'when', ""'re"", 'eight', 'years', 'old', ""'ll"", 'be', 'great', 'forever', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'high', 'school', 'older', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Thus', 'continuing', 'popularity', 'Goonies', 'finally', 'been', 'explained', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'when', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'came', 'out', 'guess', 'reaction', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'surprise', 'was', 'fun', 'what', 'was', 'readers', 'Michael', 'Ende', 'novel', 'are', 'likely', 'feel', 'cheated', 'even', 'shred', 'subtlety', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'beating', 'head', 'movie', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes.Barret', 'Oliver', 'D.', 'A.', 'R.', 'Y.', 'L.', 'Frankenweenie', 'Bastian', 'who', 'time', 'getting', 'picked', 'school', 'listening', 'father', 'Gerald', 'McRaney', 'years', 'away', 'Major', 'Dad', 'fame', 'talk', 'how', 'awful', 'have', 'imagination', 'running', 'school', 'bullies', 'bookshop', 'owned', 'rather', 'odd', 'chap', 'named', 'Koreander', 'Thomas', 'Hill', 'who', 'played', 'president', 'Nude', 'Bomb', 'Get', 'Smart', 'movie', 'book', 'Koreander', 'plot', 'essence', 'rest', 'film', 'save', 'merciless', 'moralizing', 'end', '.Despite', 'said', 'merciless', 'moralizing', 'things', 'beginning', 'film', 'imparts', 'viewer', 'are', 'okay', 'steal', 'stuff', 'stores', 'as', 'long', 'leave', 'note', 'saying', ""'re"", 'going', 'give', 'back', 'okay', 'cut', 'school', 'as', 'long', 'have', 'something', 'better', 'do', 'matter', 'how', 'long', 'stay', 'away', 'one', 'will', 'come', 'looking', 'spoiler', 'say', 'part', 'end', 'moral', 'actions', 'have', 'consequences', ""'m"", 'sure', 'who', 'were', 'slightly', 'younger', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'have', 'decidedly', 'different', 'take', 'take', 'advice', 'ever-so-wise', 'friend', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', ""'re"", 'going', 'sit', 'there', 'end', 'wondering', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about', '**']",The NeverEnding Story VHS

After well over a decade of not seeing it, I watched it again while comparing its two soundtracks. The New -Wave/-Age-ish title ballad is one of the better songs of the genre, and the actual score has its moments. Oddly, I found myself often comparing this to the same year's ""Supergirl.""One scene sums up my attitude to this movie, then or now, which prevented me from taking it as seriously as other fantasy/SF flicks. When he reads about the death of Artax (Atreju's trusty horse), it's scored by a standard, unengaging death march, and the overacting is rife on both boys' faces. While I am saddened by the death of any animal (and most people), the scene was either flat or eye-rolling for me. If I didn't suspect it already, by then I *knew* this was a movie I wouldn't be able to take very seriously. Oh, it picked up and improved and had some nice scenes and plot points and characterizations thereafter, but for all intents and purposes it had already reduced itself to a standard-issue cut-and-dry fantasy movie, albeit with some really sweet visuals and some decent bits of score.While there's something to be said for the theme of preserving and encouraging imagination, it just seems so lame that 'Bastian wastes almost the entire movie escaping reality and responsibility (in his school's storage room, no less); he ironically refuses to use/release his imagination until the very last second; and then solves his bully problem by scaring them into dumpsters. Jeez, he has no future at this rate.Yes, this movie is pure cheese: it's not as stinky as limburger, it's not sharp as cheddar, it's more like standard American cheese, mass-produced and shrink-wrapped for your average ordinary sandwich.

And I had a huge imagination.  I would have loved to be in a story like that.  I love it when Bastian comes into the story and he realizes it and says &quot;But that's impossible!&quot;  And my favorite part is when he throws the book.

364550,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,6303212395,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[1, 1]","I first saw this movie as a young child. It continued to be one of my favorites all my life. Since first seeing this movie, I have been exposed to countless thousands of movies, everything from Kurosawa to Orson Welles and John Ford. But Fantasy and Sci-Fi have always been my favorite kind of movies. Amazingly, rather than degrade with time, this movie just gets better and better. Why? Well first of all, the plot is the often used but always great story of a boy on a quest to save the world. It worked in Star Wars, it worked in Dune, it worked in every Final Fantasy game, and it works here. Secondly, the visuals are some of the best seem in any movie ever. Don't see this movie of VHS. It MUST be experienced on DVD in all its wide-screen glory. The special effects are perfect (taken right from the 80s golden age of matte paintings and blue screen before CGI destroyed the artistry of visuals). The soundtrack is one of the best in any movie ever. In short, this is in my opinion, the best movie Wolfgang Peterson ever made, and one of the greatest fantasy flicks of all time. Movies come and go, but this story remains...neverending. It is my favorite movie of all time.In my opinion, The Neverending Story is the greatest fantasy movie ever made. When it was made it was the most expensive movie ever made outside of the United States. It was also a box office flop. But like The Wizard of Oz, It's a Wonderful Life, and several modern films I could name, real genius is just a bit much for some people to take ahead of its time and all at once. There has been a lot of discussion about the book vs. the movie, and while I'm not usually a fan of modifying books heavily for the big-screen adaptation, in this case I absolutely have to make an exception. You see the thing is, while I love the movie, I don't really like the book. Michael Ende may have been right about one thing when he tried to sue the film-makers for deviating from his book: this movie is not the book in film form, it's something else entirely. There are concepts that work in books, but just don't translate to an audio/visual medium very well. I LIKE the Nothing as storm rather than as a silent consuming force. I LIKE the gate to the Southern Oracle being lethal rather than paralyzing.  The simplification and streamlining/reworking of the story to what the movie became was the RIGHT decision to make, much as it may irk purists and fans of the book. The only other movie I can think of where I approve so much of slaughtering a book's vision is The Secret of NIMH (it was actually Don Bluth's comments about what works and doesn't work in a film vs. a book in the commentary of that film that made me realize I feel The Neverending Story is SUPERIOR to the book because of the changes made). For better or worse, whether you like the deviations of the story from the book or not, the film was made the way it was. Personally I absolutely love it.""Not Atreyu the child, Atreyu the Warrior!""The emotional core of the film, the protagonist inside of the book, Atreyu, is the stuff of legend. Here we have a British actor playing a Native American archetype, a child actor playing a child warrior. When you're a kid watching this movie for the first time you never question or think about such things even for a second, and as an adult, you might like me feel amazed by the alternating extreme vulnerability and confident strength brought to the character. You have to empathize with the character, even see yourself in him as a child, while at the same time seeing that good old-fashioned hero pluck that makes you love Luke Skywalker. I really do think it's one of the great child-actor performances of all time, simply because he's not some muscle-bound action hero. He's a kid. And he's got to save the world. And you never question it for a moment. You believe it. Awesome. In an old interview I found on the net the child-actor said of the character he played ""I AM Atreyu."" I agree.""Bastian, please! Save us!""The child who plays Bastian, and the child who plays the Empress both similarly surpass themselves in playing very serious demanding roles with incredibly sincerity and believability. While Bastian plays his character the most like a normal, shy, introverted child (you can really feel his childishness and immaturity at the end of the movie when he has to choose between trying to act and live the way everyone else insists that he should (like an adult!), and doing what he really wants to in order to save an entire world). The Empress impresses despite her very short screen time by managing quite quickly to convince you despite a very young age, that she at once gravely ill, very old, and (as my dear sister Codemaster Talon put it) actually Empress of something! That super-calm serenity, deep sadness, and knowing smile (I absolutely love the look she gives Atreyu when he says he's failed [but she knows better], and the smile she starts to show when Atreyu asks why Bastian doesn't do something if he knows how to save them). Codemaster Talon also said that ""Never before was so much heavy lifting required by so many child actors."" And I'll add that never before was it been lifted so far and so well.""I never knew it was THAT beautiful.""It's fascinates me how the use of wide-screen, wide-angle camera-work results not in a kiddie-feeling movie, but in in adult, epic, emotionally powerful film. And more than that, the artwork results in mesmerizing landscapes that just have to be seen wide-screen to be believed (there is nothing like the feeling the first time you see the Ivory Tower). When Atreyu sets off on his quest and you see him ride past massive crystals and past screen-filling rainbows, over dunes and through grassy plains, you feel the distance and get swept up in the grandeur of the world that has been created.Visually this film is stunning. The painted backgrounds and wide angle shots are some of the best in any film ever made, and they combine with the music to make this one of the most beautiful films in history. The special effects are obviously reference quality, on the level of Star Wars. They aren't CGI cartoons and digitally re-touched pictures. The effects in this movie come from great craftsmanship in the old-school tradition. Miniatures, puppetry, painted backgrounds, and brilliant set design combine with amazing voice-acting, and spectacular cinematography to create a wold that is more than just fantastic, it's believable, and makes you feel that it is all REAL.The music of this movie has been debated for some time now. It seems to be very popular these days to equate ""original cut"" with ""superior film"", even if it is not necessarily the case. I don't speak German. I haven't seen the original theatrical version of this film, nor have I heard the complete original score. But I do know this: some of the most memorable music in the film came from the International version we've all seen. The theme for the Ivory Tower is one of the coolest pieces of music in film history, and it was NOT composed for the film by it's original composer. Say what you will, that's a cool piece of music that I for one am GLAD is in the movie. Regardless of re-edits and cuts and new music, the score to this film is one of the best and most memorable in movie history, and it's a sad thing indeed that the COMPLETE music for this film has never been, and possibly never will be made available. What music is playing on my computer speakers and on my MP3 players all the time. Not just good. Fantastic.I really think that this is Wolfgang Peterson's best film. I've seen a few in my time, and while some of them were pretty good, none of the ones I saw ever came close to the magic of this film. I think it was made at the zenith of his talent and ability, as was Miyazaki's Nausicaa and George Lucas' Star Wars. You can feel the idealism and courage in this film, it permeates everything.""Never give up, and good luck will find you.""Throughout my life I've seen this film as a metaphor for my own life experiences, and that's because it perfectly captures the hero's quest mythology that I love so much. I can't imagine a more frightening test than the Sphinx Gate to the Southern Oracle (whose burning eyes can see straight into your heart and fry you to a crisp in an instant from a hundred feet in the air). I can't imagine a more perfect metaphor for losing your faith in life and having it restored than drowning in the swamps of sadness only to have your life saved by a light in the sky that heralds your rescue by a Luck Dragon. And just when you think it's all over and you've completely failed, you may be surprised to know that making the journey was a victory in itself, and you always had the ability to save what's most important to you, you just had to believe it with all your heart and do something about it.With the world so full of cynicism and practicality rubbish, it feels so good to put this movie in and be reminded just for a little while that stories and dreams are, after all, far more important than silly things like reality and a world filled with hatred and despair.If you think this movie is over-rated, you may need to see it properly. It's a three star movie on a tiny TV, a four star movie wide-screen, and a five star movie on a projector with the volume cranked way up (especially since the volume on the disc is a little low). There are a few movies that I really wish I could see in a movie theater just once. I would pay $50.00 to see this film in a theater. No joke. I hope and pray that this film will one day get the remastered in high-definition, DTS, full-making of documentary, and feature length commentary with all the actors and director on a super-special edition DVD (I doubt the German version will ever be available but it sure would be nice to include it). Until then the U.S. release of this film on DVD has good sound and picture and allows everyone to enjoy a wide-screen clear transfer of this, the best fantasy film I've ever seen, and my personal favorite movie ever.",5,"""You would be willing to go on a quest?""",1017705600,"04 2, 2002",2002,10074,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'young', 'child', 'continued', 'be', 'one', 'favorites', 'life',

Good review, by the way.This is an awesome story about the importance of the story.  Yes, the moral lesson of &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; is the importance of the story itself (and by extension the importance of human imagination).  If one has read some of Joseph Campbell's &quot;The Power of Myth&quot; one understands this completely.  It is that Native American idea of &quot;he who does not have the stories has nothing.&quot;The key force of destruction in this tale is &quot;the Nothing&quot; literally non-existence or the lack of imagination.  The world in which &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; takes place, Fantasia, is a conglomerate universe composed of the dreams and hopes of all people.  Every story ever told and every character who has ever lived exists somewhere in Fantasia.  So that somewhere in Fantasia, Paul Atreides wanders a desert landscape while somewhere else in Fantasia Alice falls down the rabbit hole.Fantasia, this conglomerate world of human dreams, is dying.  The reason is that people in the real world no longer dream... of anything.  It is a very modern tale about the death of the human capacity to, as John Lennon put it, IMAGINE.  Without the capability to imagine anything, people become easily manipulated by forces greater than them... this is where the real villain comes in (more about that after the next paragraph).The main protagonist, Atreyu, is the alter ego of the real life boy who is reading the story.  The real life boy, therefore, is filled with imagination, brimming with it, in fact.  He exists in a real world where nobody imagines anything anymore.  Therefore, the alter ego (in Fantasia) of the real life boy with imagination is a young champion who is trying to save imagination itself and its conglomerate world, Fantasia.The real villain of the story is, at least from a Christian context, Lucifer, or the Devil himself.  He is the &quot;force behind the Nothing&quot; who is attempting the death of all imagination.  This explains the creature known as the Morg.  As Sir Adam mentioned in his review, this is the major adversary for Atreyu (and the real life boy who is his generator).  The Morg is, in his own words, &quot;a servant of the force behind the Nothing.&quot;  The Morg is, I believe, a demon, or fallen angel servant who has somehow crossed the border into Fantasia and put on the guise of that mythical creature of destruction, the werewolf.  The Wolf image is only a guise used by the demon to try to blend in with his surroundings.Of course, we know who wins in the end.  This is a very complex movie and a VERY relevant one to the times in which we are living.  I see people around me who are quite literally mental cripples who are incapable of imagination.

Well, it turned out to be pretty darn corny. That's okay though, because it IS a movie for kids after all. I just wish it had grown on me more. Mainly I was just wishing that I was watching something else, or that the movie would speed up a little. It is slow and ponderous. Or maybe I am just too darn old. It's still a good movie, worth 5 stars no doubt.One interesting effect was on the version I was watching. I was watching it recorded off of TV, with captions. The captions were all in white words as usual, except for Gmork the evil wolf-thing. His words were displayed on the screen in a frighteningly-cool green-colored lettering that matched his eyes. That's not something you see too often. So that was pretty neat.The movie did creep me out at one point though. The Empress is explaining to Atreyu that a little human boy is watching them and listening to their every move, and that other people were watching him in turn and have also shared in his pains. (Or something to that effect.) Wow, how creepy is that? That gave me the shivers! How could she have known right then that it would be me who was watching that movie 20 years later? I mean, how would she have known? So that was kind of amazing. I wonder if it still says that part if someone else is watching the movie. It is still hard to believe that the movie was really talking about ME. But there it was! Plain as day.It is kind of like how the movie ""Three Men and a Baby"" can creep you out when you see the ghost of the little boy in the window who was killed in that building earlier. It is scary but I like to see movies with this sort of thing. Mainly because I like getting in touch with alternate energies, channeling my life force, focusing my spiritual center, and developing my psychic powers.

It is a complex book in that it interweaves a story about a lonley boy whose mother had died some time ago. His father stunned by his wife's death has problems giving his son the love and support needed. The son walks into a strange bookshop and finds a book called the ""Never Ending Story"". The book combines a story about a fantasy kingdom with the boys reaction to what he reads.The action in the fantasy kingdom revolves around the threat to this kingdom by the ""nothing"". The reality being its destruction by non belief. A warrior boy sets out to counter this menace and has a range of adventures on the way.The charm of the book was the complexity of the story and the interaciton between the boy reading and the story unfolding.

364576,A3DW8ZTQINZQ7N,6303212395,Travis T. Black,"[13, 14]","I imagine most people looking for a review of the Blu-Ray have seen this film before. Still, I want to express my deep and utter respect and love for this amazing movie which still holds up beautifully nearly 3 decades later. Some people may regard it as a film for children, and I suppose that's fine. However, I think when one takes a longer look at not just the visual scope or surface aesthetics of The Neverending Story, they will find a message far deeper and more complex than nearly any ""children's"" film from this past decade.The new high definition transfer on the disc itself is quite impressive. The clarity and vibrancy has definitely breathed new life into the film, giving the picture far more dimension and detail than anyone has probably seen since its theatrical release. It's fairly obvious that some time and money was spent on restoring and color correcting this film so that it would look beautiful in 1080p HD (THANK YOU WARNER BROS!). The older U.S. DVD from 2001 always appeared to be a bit faded or washed out to my eyes. Not only that, but that print was full of visual flaws such as dirt, scratches, was occasionally out of focus in some shots, and white specs frequently popped up throughout the film. These problems are no longer an issue with this new 2010 transfer for the most part. Colors here are far more vibrant, although purist will be pleased that I detected no hint of DNR and film grain has been left intact to a large degree. Those of you who are used to the old DVD will immediately take notice of the higher black levels in most scenes. This is especially apparent during the first sequences in Fantasia, most notably at the Ivory Tower, which has been restored to its proper evening tones as the sun sets.Another huge plus in addition to the over-hauled visual presentation is the loss-less 5.1 Audio track. Previous releases have all been in 2.1 stereo and the difference definitely had me sitting up and taking notice! The sub-woofer got a good workout and the rear speakers were very lively throughout the film. Rest assured, the 5.1 track is very tasteful and lacks anything that most would probably label as ""gimmicky"".However, as pleased as I am with this particular feature presentation of one of my most beloved movies, it's impossible to overlook the complete and utter lack of any kind of bonus material whatsoever. Nothing and I mean NOTHING has been provided in the way of extras here. The previous DVD at least contained a theatrical trailer and production notes. For this reason I am subtracting one star. Let's hope a more ""special"" version of this film is released in the future, perhaps even containing the alternate German cut with 7 minutes of extra footage and certain scenes with alternate (actually, the original) score.Bottom Line:Don't let the lack of features keep you from buying this disc, which contains a sparkling new presentation of a haunting film. And is, what I personally consider to be the greatest of all the 80's Fantasy films, up there with Dark Crystal and Legend.",4,"""Story"" shines on Blu-Ray but lacks bonus features",1267574400,"03 3, 2010",2010,3049,"['imagine', 'most', 'people', 'looking', 'review', 'Blu-Ray', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'Still', 'want', 'express', 'deep', 'utter', 'respect', 'love', 'amazing', 'movie', 'still', 'up', 'beautifully', 'nearly', '3', 'decades', 'later', 'people', 'may', 'regard', 'film', 'children', 'suppose', 'fine', 'However', 'think', 'when', 'one', 'longer', 'look', 'not', 'just', 'visual', 'scope', 'surface', 'aesthetics', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'will', 'find', 'message', 'far', 'deeper', 'more', 'complex', 'nearly', 'children', 'film', 'past', 'decade.The', 'new', 'high', 'definition', 'transfer', 'disc', 'quite', 'impressive', 'clarity', 'vibrancy', 'definitely', 'breathed', 'new', 'life', 'film', 'giving', 'picture', 'far', 'more', 'dimension', 'detail', 'anyone', 'probably', 'seen', 'theatrical', 'release', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'time', 'money', 'was', 'spent', 'restoring', 'color', 'correcting', 'film', 'so', 'would', 'look', 'beautiful', '1080p', 'HD', 'THANK', 'YOU', 'WARNER', 'BROS', 'older', 'U.S.', 'DVD', '2001', 'always', 'appeared', 'be', 'bit', 'faded', 'washed', 'eyes', 'Not', 'only', 'print', 'was', 'full', 'visual', 'flaws', 'such', 'dirt', 'scratches', 'was', 'occasionally', 'focus', 'shots', 'white', 'specs', 'frequently', 'popped', 'up', 'film', 'problems', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'issue', 'new', '2010', 'transfer', 'most', 'part', 'Colors', 'here', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'vibrant', 'purist', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'detected', 'hint', 'DNR', 'film', 'grain', 'been', 'left', 'intact', 'large', 'degree', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'old', 'DVD', 'will', 'immediately', 'take', 'notice', 'higher', 'black', 'levels', 'most', 'scenes', 'especially', 'apparent', 'first', 'sequences', 'Fantasia', 'most', 'notably', 'Ivory', 'Tower', 'been', 'restored', 'proper', 'evening', 'tones', 'sun', 'sets.Another', 'huge', 'addition', 'over-hauled', 'visual', 'presentation', 'loss-less', '5.1', 'Audio', 'track', 'Previous', 'releases', 'have', 'been', '2.1', 'stereo', 'difference', 'definitely', 'had', 'sitting', 'up', 'taking', 'notice', 'sub-woofer', 'got', 'good', 'workout', 'rear', 'speakers', 'were', 'very', 'lively', 'film', 'Rest', 'assured', '5.1', 'track', 'very', 'tasteful', 'anything', 'most', 'would', 'probably', 'label', 'gimmicky', '.However', 'as', 'pleased', 'am', 'particular', 'feature', 'presentation', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'movies', 'impossible', 'overlook', 'complete', 'utter', 'lack', 'kind', 'bonus', 'material', 'whatsoever', 'Nothing', 'mean', 'NOTHING', 'been', 'provided', 'way', 'extras', 'here', 'previous', 'DVD', 'least', 'contained', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'production', 'notes', 'reason', 'am', 'subtracting', 'one', 'star', 'Let', 'hope', 'more', 'special', 'version', 'film', 'released', 'future', 'perhaps', 'even', 'containing', 'alternate', 'German', 'cut', '7', 'minutes', 'extra', 'footage', 'certain', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'actually', 'original', 'score.Bottom', 'Line', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'lack', 'features', 'keep', 'buying', 'disc', 'sparkling', 'new', 'presentation', 'haunting', 'film', 'what', 'personally', 'consider', 'be', 'greatest', '80', 'Fantasy', 'films', 'up', 'there', 'Dark', 'Crystal', 'Legend']",The NeverEnding Story VHS

Most of the time these little gags fall flat on their faces.  However with Neverending Story it is truely one of a kind in the relm that it has a strong message, and a touching story that one can't help but love.The Neveredning Story starts off with the young boy Bastian who is constantly tormented by a group of bullies.  One day as he is running away from them he hides inside of a dusty old book store where he meets an ecentric old book keeper.  The old man doesn't like bastian because Bastian is part of the TV era.  However Bastian likes to read books.  The old man turns his back for a moment and bastian borrows the book the old man was reading the Neverending story.  At that point Bastian hides out in the school storage room where he starts to read the book.  The story he reads (and of course we witness) is the story of an evil force known as the Nothingis slowly destroying the world of Fantasia.  It is up to a young warrior known as Atreu who must journey through out Fantasia and find a way to destroy the Nothing.  Along the way he meets up with Falcore the Luck Dragon, the Rock Biter, and an assortment of many other characters in the attemp to save Fantasia.  In the End Atreu and BAstian have more in common than they think and it falls into Bastians hands to save Fantasia (the childs imagination).This heart warming and truely awsome tale is one of the best in the field of Fantasy.  It is truely a one of a kind and the sequels and remake only taint this wonderful classic.

Just for the movie, I give 3 stars. Yes, for the new people that has not seen the movie, it looks old and the special effects are good but not so as the new ones from Episode II, but the movie and the message are beautiful. The movie runs (with a bit less creatures than the book) following faithfully the path that Michael Ende wrote. It ends just at the middle of the book, just to try not to cut so much from it.Why did it losses 2 stars? Because the only thing good the dvd has is the movie, the rest of features are just a trailer, some pictures of the movie itself and some written data.  No music, no interviews, no featurettes, no comentary, no review or similitudes (or differences) with the book, not even filmography of the cast.  In other words, is almost the same as buying the VHS version, only it will last more time because of the media.That is why.Recomendation: Buy it for the movie.",3,"Great Movie, poor dvd",1029888000,"08 21, 2002",2002,1000,"['What', 'say', 'Neverending', 'story', 'great', 'story', 'read', 'book', 'see', 'movie', 'Just', 'movie', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'Yes', 'new', 'people', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'old', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'so', 'new', 'ones', 'Episode', 'II', 'movie', 'message', 'are', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'bit', 'less', 'creatures', 'book', 'following', 'faithfully', 'path', 'Michael', 'Ende', 'wrote', 'just', 'middle', 'book', 'just', 'try', 'not', 'cut', 'so', 'much', 'it.Why', 'did', 'losses', '2', 'stars', 'only', 'thing', 'good', 'dvd', 'movie', 'rest', 'features', 'are', 'just', 'trailer', 'pictures', 'movie', 'written', 'data', 'music', 'interviews', 'featurettes', 'comentary', 'review', 'similitudes', 'differences', 'book', 'not', 'even', 'filmography', 'cast', 'other', 'words', 'almost', 'same', 'buying', 'VHS', 'version', 'only', 'will', 'last', 'more', 'time', 'media.That', 'why.Recomendation', 'Buy', 'movie']",The NeverEnding Story VHS

364586,A38N7SFDOB3MR3,6303212395,Wisconsin Dad,"[4, 4]","The Neverending Story is a great fantasy movie that is wonderful for seven year olds, and seven year olds at heart. While at times some of the special effects are dated, the story itself stands the test of time.The Neverending Story is a story about a small boy named Bastian who loses his mother and is told by his father to ""deal with his pain"" and grow up past the need for all his escapist fantasy books. Having read everything from Tarzan to the Lord of the Rings, Bastian discovers a book called the Neverending Story, and finds his way into the most fascinating ride of his life.The creatures and fantasy beings in the story are incredibly unique and fun to watch. We really liked the Rock Biter, and the Swamps of Sadness.The Neverending Story shares many wonderful endearing qualities with films such as the Wizard of Oz and Jumanji. If you are looking for a pure, simple and exciting escape, and a great movie for all ages, you can't go wrong owning this DVD.
