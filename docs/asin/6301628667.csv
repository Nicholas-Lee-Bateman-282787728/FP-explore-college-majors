However, like the Sistine Chapel, it takes time.  With a sweeping grandeur that is matched by the awesome cinematography, 'The Agony and the Ecstacy' gives us magnificent views.  It also presents the volatile relationship between Pope Julius II (Harrison) and Michelangelo (Heston).  Their sparring is a matter of wills by two steadfast men who only know how to do things their own way.  Of course, Julius is the pope.  He's a warrior who wishes to reclaim the Papal States and bring Christendom to a more glorified stature.  The French, among others, don't agree.  They wish to dethrone their ""anti-pope"" in battle.  Michaelangelo, who is too perfectionist to consider himself an interior decorator, makes the Sistine Chapel his own battleground.  He's up to the task of painting it, even if he is reluctant to leave sculpting, his true passion.Although the battle and painting scenes contain much splendor, at times the movie is plodding.  At the beginning, we are given an art history lesson:  One that spills into the starting dialogue.  Much of the tension of the plot depends on the two combatants.  Often the right combination mixes well,  and it works effectively.  Sometimes, it's only paint-by-numbers.

259167,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6301628667,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","The Agony and the Ecstasy, 1965 filmThis is a story about the life of Michelangelo, the famous painter and sculptor from the late 15th century. Pope Julius II returns from the war, he led the Holy League (the Vatican States, Venice, and others) in a war against the French (who invaded northern Italy). Florence signed a Peace Treaty with the French and did not join the Holy League. After the French were defeated the Holy League invaded the Florentine Republic to restore the Medici family to the throne. Machiavelli wrote about this in his &#8220;Letter to the Prince&#8221; and got his old job back. You will best appreciate this movie if you know about the political background of this era. It was a violent and tumultuous time, like Europe in the 20th century. Other rulers were Richard III and Henry VII of England, King Louis IX (?) of France, the Emperor Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire, and Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain. Turkey threatened Europe since the Fall of Constantinople.Pope Julius II converses with the French Ambassador. Then he discusses a pamphlet that Michelangelo wrote about the Pope. Julius II wants a tomb and to build a new church in Rome. He also wants the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel redecorated to show the Twelve Apostles, etc. Scaffolding is raised to allow work to begin. First large cartoons are drawn on paper for a guide. The work progresses with Michelangelo&#8217;s helpers. Later he destroys the ongoing frescoes. Another conceited artist? He is now a hunted man. Men work in a quarry to mine marble. [A bed of sand would cushion this falling rock.] The scenes of the country pad out this movie. Michelangelo gets an inspiration from the sunrise and the clouds. He shows his new design to Julius II and its accepted. Work proceeds, it will cost much more. &#8220;When will it be ended?&#8221; asks Julius. &#8220;When I&#8217;m finished.&#8221; [Original work is seldom finished on schedule and on budget.]Cardinals object to the nude figures, as in pagan Greek art, but Michelangelo quotes Scripture. The work goes on. His vision become blurred! He has an accident but no broken bones. Rafael is his competitor; is he comparable? Does this challenge re-motivate Michelangelo? Is his health weakening? Pope Julius learns the French have invaded Lombardy, the Germans are at the Brenner Pass; but no word from the Spanish. He must retreat or attack. Michelangelo interrupts a very stressed Pope and is rebuked. Later Julius leads his troops out of Rome. Rafael visits Michelangelo, they talk. Artists are the servants or lackeys of the rich and powerful; they have no choice. We see a smoking battlefield. Julius is wounded but can ride his horse.Michelangelo apologizes to Pope Julius, but the enemies will soon take Rome. Money is needed to continue Michelangelo&#8217;s work. Another Red Hat is sold to get the money. Julius inspects the paintings, he suffers from a battle wound. There is good news, alliances with the Spanish, Swiss, and English. But this depends on the health of the Pope. Michelangelo is ordered to complete the work, or else. [It is an offer that he can&#8217;t refuse.] Pope Julius II recovers. Michelangelo&#8217;s work is completed. They show scenes of the ceiling. Is there more work for Michelangelo? Julius&#8217; work is also finished, the invaders are driven out of Italy. Now the tomb of Julius II can be finished. &#8220;To work.&#8221; [I didn&#8217;t know much about Michelangelo before, or after, this movie. I wonder what was omitted?

259168,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6301628667,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[207, 210]","There is no other film on the subject of art that is better than this one in my opinion. Irving Stone's best-seller was a great read, but in this case the film is better than the book. It centers on the creation of the Sistine Chapel ceiling, and the contentious but invigorating relationship between Michelangelo and Pope Julius II; one drove the other &quot;to complete his work&quot;, and even their verbal battles were productive. It is about the courage of putting one's vision into reality, the hard work, and the faith in one's self and in God.The script by Irving Stone and Philip Dunne is fabulous; the words flow like sweet wine and there is not a single unnecessary scene, or rarely one that is not meaningful. The direction by Carol Reed is meticulous, the cinematography by Leon Shamroy a marvel, and the score by Alex North adds much to the film. The costuming and sets are lavish for the papal quarters and the Medici household, and give one a sense of 16th century Rome, and the depictions of the fresco painting technique is interesting and educational.Charlton Heston, gaunt and bearded, is brilliant as Michelangelo, as is Rex Harrison as the warrior pope. The interactions of these two actors is riveting, and the dialogue between them worth hearing repeatedly. Others of note in the cast include Diane Cilento as the Contessina de Medici, Harry Andrews as Bramante, and Tomas Milian as Raphael  (the most famous papal portrait I know of is by Raphael, of Pope Julian II).Though Stone's book and script take much artistic license, there is also a good deal of accuracy. This period of 16th century Italy was one of the most fascinating in all world history, and Pope Julius II was not only one of its greatest art patrons, but also an extraordinary man.This is a film that moves me to tears with its beauty, and brightens my mind with its words. If you are interested in the artistic process, don't miss this magnificent film.The film includes a Prologue, a mini-documentary of modern-day Rome and Florence, which traces Michelangelo's life, from his birth in Tuscany in 1475, showing his many wondrous works, including an early sculpture he did at the age of 15, through his death in 1564.

It is here on the VHS tape, as part of the feature.  It runs about 20 minutes, but one should not fast-forward through it.  It is fascinating, and adds tremendoubly to the enjoyment of the main feature.  In fact, movie channels sometimes run this as a featurette without running the full film.  And that's just fine with me.Also, one should see this film in the &quot;Letterbox&quot; format to get the true scope of what director Reed was trying to present.  &quot;Full Frame&quot; or &quot;pan and scan&quot; versions add electronic edits where none existed in the original and can chop up a film unnecessarily.True, this feature reads like a &quot;Reader's Digest&quot; version of the life of Michaelangelo; a sort of &quot;highlights&quot; of the man's life.  It does heavily  concentrate on the on-again, off-again relationship with Pope Julius II, and sllows Harrison do drop in his deliciously dead-pan one-liners.Should a new version of Michaelangelo's life be filmed (perhaps as a miniseries)?  Most definately.  Should an actor who more resembled the artist be cast?  Yes.  But, remember that AGONY was filmed in the 1960s and star power was the order of the day.  Heston was hot; so was Harrison (My Fair Lady).  Mr. Heston, however, has left, in print, his impressions (not all of them flattering) of both Harrison and Mr. Reed in his DIARIES.

I don't mean that it's macabre, profane, or anything like that. From an overt standpoint, the story lacks entertainment whatsoever. But, I find the film, even though it is a 136 minute picture, very engrossing and interesting for its study of the relationship between Pope Julius and Michelangelo, played very well by Rex Harrison and Charlton Heston respectively, during one of the most important period part of the Italian Renaissance. Another thing I love about The Agony and the Ecstasy is the costumes. This is an incredible piece of work in creating those costumes. Moreover, the introduction of The Agony and the Ecstasy is well deserving and fascinating because Michelangelo was larger than life and one of the most honored and fascinating people the world has ever known.

This telling of the painting of the Sistine Chapel has a unified, realistic aura handled expertly by Reed with a sound cast. The always professional Rex Harrison delivers bite and verve in his incredible incarnation of a Renaissance warrior-pope.  Heston as Michelangelo is, of course, Heston -- he was bound to be plugged into any major bible epic or historical religious drama of his day, so why not do Michelangelo?  The Hollywood star machine dictated nothing less, anyway.  People of Heston's own era may thus well continue to have a problem with him in all these grand roles for awhile -- he is simply too recognizable at this point of his career to allow you to imagine Michelangelo. The trade off is how well he does it.  And certain scenes, like the stone quarry scene, are magnicent and magical.Reed's direction surmounts a lot of the usual glitches of the ""epic"" genre and moves along briskly.  You of course have to write a certain amount of impossible dialogue for a venture of this sort, otherwise not do it at all.  It has been done much more badly, ie., The Ten Commandments.  Then you have the impossible task of dealing with one of the best known artists in history and not falling into cliche.  You would call the ""when will it be done?"" mantra of the pope cliched, the hero-artist versus the mean worldly patron, except for the fact that it simply and elegantly works, as a plot engine if nothing else.  The film finally avoids either preachiness or pretention; it wisely opts just to tell a story of the relationship of two men.  It does certainly have something to say about how great classic art was created, and this is something most important for the modern viewer not only to know, but also to experience.Overall, one cannot be sorry that the whole Renaissance is not here, or be troubled by some obvious invention.  For the film is not a documentary.  What it is is a brave, good shot at the impossible.

They attempt a Biblical link by making this the story of the Pope and Michaelangelo, bickering over which works of art will be commissioned and completed next.

So it is a half good film, but the rest of the scenes are just okay, or outright boring.I suppose you can learn a little bit about Michaelangelo's work from this film, but if the Biblical inaccuracies of THE TEN COMMANDMENTS teach us anything, it is that these major Hollywood films play fast and loose with the smaller details, so take anything you might think you have learned, and take it with a grain of salt, as to its likely historical accuracy.",3,"Slow, Sluggish Film of Dubious Historical Accuracy, but Good Chemistry Between Heston and Harrison!",1167091200,"12 26, 2006",2006,1188,"['movie', 'slow', 'boring', 'made', 'only', 'worthwhile', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'fans', 'great', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'Heston', 'co-star', 'Rex', 'Harrison.Charlton', 'Heston', 'THE', 'TEN', 'COMMANDMENTS', 'classic', 'all-time', 'great', 'film', 'due', 'good', 'writing', 'great', 'performances', 'many', 'major', 'Biblical', 'errors', 'none', 'too', 'grievous', 'Scripture', '.THE', 'AGONY', 'THE', 'ECSTACY', 'second', 'rate', 'content', 'overall', 'results', 'when', 'compared', 'THE', 'TEN', 'COMMANDMENTS', 'attempt', 'Biblical', 'link', 'making', 'story', 'Pope', 'Michaelangelo', 'bickering', 'works', 'art', 'will', 'be', 'commissioned', 'completed', 'next', 'only', 'good', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'when', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'are', 'doing', 'scene', 'together', 'half', 'good', 'film', 'rest', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'okay', 'outright', 'boring.I', 'suppose', 'can', 'learn', 'little', 'bit', 'Michaelangelo', 'work', 'film', 'Biblical', 'inaccuracies', 'THE', 'TEN', 'COMMANDMENTS', 'teach', 'anything', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'play', 'fast', 'loose', 'smaller', 'details', 'so', 'take', 'anything', 'might', 'think', 'have', 'learned', 'take', 'grain', 'salt', 'likely', 'historical', 'accuracy']",N/A

Both of these movies perfectly capture the passions and frustrations that come with the overwhelming urge to create.Carol Reed's meticulous screen adaptation of Irving Stone's novel, THE AGONY AND THE ECSTASY, brings vivid life to the story of how Pope Julius II commissioned an initially unwilling Michelangelo to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. The film bristles with emotion as the two men clash on everything from their views on the work's conception and cost, to its style of expression and seemingly endless execution.Heston is magnificent as the sensitive, tempermental artist, and Rex Harrison is no less so as the warrior pope, who tries to reconcile his opposing secular and spiritual obligations. While they lock horns throughout the ceiling's slow progression, both men come to have a deep respect for each other, and realize that the finished fresco will serve a purpose greater than either one's contribution to it. It's a tribute to both actors' performances that none of this is overshadowed by the epic scale of the production, which accurately reproduces the period and does justice to the subject matter. The scenes of the ceiling in preliminary stages and the depiction of how difficult a task it was to paint are incredible and totally convincing. The film maintains an exceptionally fine standard in both its imagery and narrative. The pre-credit sequence showing several of Michelangelo's marble masterpieces is most appropriate.20th Century Fox's DVD of THE AGONY AND THE ECSTASY looks beautiful; with rich, stable color saturation that pops from the screen.

It demolishes a few long-held myths about Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel.  Firstly, he didn't paint the ceiling lying on his back.  This idea came about through a mistranslation of a description in Italian.  He stood but leaned backwards.  Secondly, he didn't work alone.  He had a team of apprentices.  Thirdly, he didn't just dream up the pictures to be painted.  He was given a detailed brief by the Vatican officials.Michelangelo started at the altar end.  When he found the first images too small to be seen clearly from below he increased the size of the figures in the later frescoes.Some reviewers have suggested that Charlton Heston didn't look much like Michelangelo.  There are three images of Michelangelo that come to mind.  Raphael depicted him as Heraclitus in ""The School of Athens"" fresco (bottom centre) in the Stanze di Raffaello in the Vatican.  Michelangelo's own self-portrait is on the skin of Saint Bartholomew in the ""Last Judgement"" (centre right) above the altar in the Sistine Chapel.  And, finally, there is Michelangelo's statue of Moses in the church of San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome.Charlton Heston had a fortuitous association with Michelangelo.  When Cecil B. DeMille was struggling to cast Moses for ""The Ten Commandments"" his associate producer, Henry Wilcoxon, convinced DeMille with a photo of Michelangelo's Moses that Heston looked just like the statue.  (See ""Written in Stone"" by Katherine Orrison.)  Then a decade later Heston was given the part of Michelangelo.  (Both he and Michelangelo had broken noses!)I've seen the Sistine Chapel ceiling three times over the decades: first, in 1969, before it was  cleaned; then during the cleaning (when modern scaffolding was supported from the same slots in the walls used by Michelangelo); and, finally, after the cleaning.I saw ""The Agony and the Ecstasy"" in 1965.  At the time Irving Stone commented that when he wrote the book he spent a great deal of time going over the proofs in order to eradicate all traces of Americanisms only to have them put back by the film's script writer.20th Century Fox is notorious for having most of its titles region-coded.

I rewatched many of my favorites and sought out some of those I had never seen.""The Agony and the Ecstasy"" was new to me. It's not one of Heston's most famous roles, but it's a well-made film and definitely worth watching. It recounts the turbulent relationship between Michelangelo (Heston) and Pope Julius II (Rex Harrison) during the period when the artist painted his magnificent frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.Heston plays Michelangelo as the proverbial tortured artist, unable to give his passion to a woman because he invests all of it in his work. Mostly he frets around with his brushes, only roaring to life when aggravated by the pope. Harrison is wonderful as the conniving (and miserly) Julius, who loves art as much as warfare.The film's running time is 138 minutes, but it feels padded as though the filmmakers were trying to create an epic out of what is really a simple story. The first 12 minutes are a narrated mini-lesson on Michelangelo's greatest works. There are many sequences of Michelangelo painting, priests chanting, and choirs singing. There is even an unnecessary intermission after an hour.But the heart of the film is the relationship between Michelangelo and the pope. Their scenes together are the most enjoyable. The two leads are good in their roles and, except for some awkward dubbing (apparently some of the actors were speaking Italian), the supporting cast is solid. The script is literate and thoughtful. It explores the importance of art in our lives, and the toll it can claim on those who create it.

This movie cemented that  thought.Michaelangelo is a master sculptor from Florence, carving the  tomb for the warrior-pope Julius (no, he isn't dead yet even though they're  carving his tomb). But Julias drags him from his commission for another  one-paint the ceiling of the Sistine chapel with &quot;appropriate  designs.&quot; Michaelangelo, who has only dabbled in fresco painting, is  both enraged and inspired. He destroys the paintings and runs away from  Rome, but returns when a vision shows him how the ceiling should be. Both  men, creator and destroyer, artist and pope, are changed forever by the  &quot;work of love&quot; that is the Sistine Chapel.Charlton Heston was  in fine form in this movie-he makes you feel everything that Michaelangelo  feels. I sometimes think that the real men rather than the monuments (like  Moses) that he plays are more his style. He does it realistically, wearing  ratty clothing and often covered with paint dribbles. Michaelangelo does  not stay the same-at the end of the movie, he is a humbler and wiser man  than before.And don't diss Rex Harrison-once I got over the &quot;Doctor  Doolittle as pope&quot; thing, I found him very enjoyable. He manages to  overcome some lines that would make me giggle in his place, including,  &quot;Is it proper for your pontiff to conduct Mass in a barn?&quot; He  makes you hate Julius initially, but as the movie progresses you grow to  love him as much as Michaelangelo.There are some truly excellent  secondary characters, like Tessina the noblewoman who sort-of-secretly  loves Michaelangelo, but understands that his paintings come first. Her  brother, a Medici cardinal, seems a bit stilted, though. Tomas Milian plays  another famous Renaissance artist, Raphael, who shows up with only a few  lines of dialogue, but changes the course of the movie. Oh, and watch out  for ice-cold architect Bramante.Combine it with the glorious shots of  the Sistine chapel's ceiling and Heston painting mockups, and you have a  movie that deserves to be a classic.",5,Almost a spiritual journey,965520000,"08 6, 2000",2000,2166,"['am', 'useless', 'sculpting', 'almost', 'so', 'painting', 'have', 'sort', 'adopted', 'Michaelangelo', 'creative', 'mentor', 'movie', 'cemented', 'thought.Michaelangelo', 'master', 'sculptor', 'Florence', 'carving', 'tomb', 'warrior-pope', 'Julius', ""n't"", 'dead', 'yet', 'even', ""'re"", 'carving', 'tomb', 'Julias', 'commission', 'one-paint', 'ceiling', 'Sistine', 'chapel', 'quot', 'appropriate', 'designs.', 'quot', 'Michaelangelo', 'who', 'only', 'dabbled', 'fresco', 'painting', 'enraged', 'inspired', 'paintings', 'away', 'Rome', 'returns', 'when', 'vision', 'how', 'ceiling', 'should', 'be', 'men', 'creator', 'destroyer', 'artist', 'pope', 'are', 'changed', 'forever', 'quot', 'work', 'love', 'quot', 'Sistine', 'Chapel.Charlton', 'Heston', 'was', 'fine', 'form', 'movie-he', 'feel', 'everything', 'Michaelangelo', 'feels', 'sometimes', 'think', 'real', 'men', 'rather', 'monuments', 'Moses', 'are', 'more', 'style', 'realistically', 'wearing', 'ratty', 'clothing', 'often', 'covered', 'paint', 'dribbles', 'Michaelangelo', 'not', 'stay', 'same-at', 'end', 'movie', 'humbler', 'wiser', 'man', 'before.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'diss', 'Rex', 'Harrison-once', 'got', 'quot', 'Doctor', 'Doolittle', 'pope', 'quot', 'thing', 'found', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'overcome', 'lines', 'would', 'make', 'giggle', 'place', 'including', 'quot', 'pontiff', 'conduct', 'Mass', 'barn', 'quot', 'hate', 'Julius', 'initially', 'movie', 'grow', 'love', 'as', 'much', 'Michaelangelo.There', 'are', 'truly', 'excellent', 'secondary', 'characters', 'Tessina', 'noblewoman', 'who', 'sort-of-secretly', 'Michaelangelo', 'paintings', 'come', 'first', 'brother', 'Medici', 'cardinal', 'bit', 'stilted', 'though', 'Tomas', 'Milian', 'famous', 'Renaissance', 'artist', 'Raphael', 'who', 'up', 'only', 'few', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'course', 'movie', 'Oh', 'watch', 'out', 'ice-cold', 'architect', 'Bramante.Combine', 'glorious', 'shots', 'Sistine', 'chapel', 'ceiling', 'Heston', 'painting', 'mockups', 'have', 'movie', 'be', 'classic']",N/A

When I finally rented it, I wished I had watched it earlier!The Sistine Chapel set is fantastic, and the ceiling paintings are vibrant and look identical to the real ones. Impressive! I especially enjoyed the simple yet moving scene in which a discouraged Michelangelo -- who has run away from Rome and gone back to cutting marble in the mountains -- sees in the clouds what he must paint on the ceiling:  God reaching out to Adam. Michelangelo stands in awe and quotes passages from Genesis.The conflict between Pope Julius and Michelangelo is both humorous and poignant. They anger one another yet they push one another to do the impossible.  When the puzzled pope wants to know why Michelangelo left, he replies, ""You beat me!"" When the artist and the pope first interact on screen, the source of conflict is a sonnet Michelangelo wrote about Julius, quickly and simply setting up the push-pull nature of their relationship. There's a bit of reverse psychology that they pull on one another, too, which the pope employs better than the straight-forward Michelangelo, but the artist turns the tables on Julius, and rouses the pope from his deathbed with understated, serious humor (if there can be such a thing).It's historical fiction, so purists will have to take the FICTION into account when viewing this film. Don't sit down with a biography of Michelangelo or Pope Julius and search for facts. Just enjoy the story! However, the people and the main events of the story did exist, did know one another, did happen. I especially like the prologue to the film, an interesting and moving review of Michelangelo's architecture and sculpture.The DVD is enhanced, with the picture quality improved over the VHS version that I originally watched, so I definitely recommend the DVD.Enjoy!",5,Great Historical Fiction,1140998400,"02 27, 2006",2006,2043,"['kept', 'seeing', 'movie', 'shelf', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'starred', 'two', 'great', 'actors', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'many', 'times', 'picked', 'up', 'kept', 'putting', 'back', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'quality', 'story', 'might', 'be', 'When', 'finally', 'rented', 'wished', 'had', 'watched', 'earlier', 'Sistine', 'Chapel', 'set', 'fantastic', 'ceiling', 'paintings', 'are', 'vibrant', 'look', 'identical', 'real', 'ones', 'Impressive', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'simple', 'yet', 'moving', 'scene', 'discouraged', 'Michelangelo', 'who', 'run', 'away', 'Rome', 'gone', 'back', 'cutting', 'marble', 'mountains', 'sees', 'clouds', 'what', 'must', 'paint', 'ceiling', 'God', 'reaching', 'out', 'Adam', 'Michelangelo', 'awe', 'quotes', 'passages', 'Genesis.The', 'conflict', 'Pope', 'Julius', 'Michelangelo', 'humorous', 'poignant', 'anger', 'one', 'yet', 'push', 'one', 'do', 'impossible', 'When', 'puzzled', 'pope', 'know', 'why', 'Michelangelo', 'left', 'beat', 'When', 'artist', 'pope', 'first', 'interact', 'screen', 'source', 'conflict', 'sonnet', 'Michelangelo', 'wrote', 'Julius', 'quickly', 'simply', 'setting', 'up', 'push-pull', 'nature', 'relationship', 'bit', 'reverse', 'psychology', 'pull', 'one', 'too', 'pope', 'better', 'straight-forward', 'Michelangelo', 'artist', 'tables', 'Julius', 'pope', 'deathbed', 'understated', 'serious', 'humor', 'can', 'be', 'such', 'thing', '.It', 'historical', 'fiction', 'purists', 'will', 'have', 'take', 'FICTION', 'account', 'when', 'viewing', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'sit', 'down', 'biography', 'Michelangelo', 'Pope', 'Julius', 'search', 'facts', 'Just', 'enjoy', 'story', 'However', 'people', 'main', 'events', 'story', 'did', 'exist', 'did', 'know', 'one', 'did', 'happen', 'especially', 'prologue', 'film', 'interesting', 'moving', 'review', 'Michelangelo', 'architecture', 'sculpture.The', 'DVD', 'enhanced', 'picture', 'quality', 'improved', 'VHS', 'version', 'originally', 'watched', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'DVD.Enjoy']",N/A

The color is quite good, almost as good as the 70 mm version, and the sharpness and detail are excellent, but they don't let you look into every glistening facial pore the way 70 mm does.The aspect ratio Amazon lists is wrong.  70 mm Todd-AO is not, and never has been, 1.33:1! The correct Todd-AO aspect ratio is 2.20:1, as detailed in the review by Ludix, which see for an excellent treatment of all technical details. [Amazon has corrected the aspect ratio cited]I saw an original 70 mm print in 1965, and the prologue and its transition to the main movie were somewhat different  I suspect the elements used to make the DVD were assembled for the 35 mm version which was prepared for release some months later.  Here is he way it was in 70mm in San Francisco: In the PROLOGUE all of the same shots that are on the DVD were used with some changes in order. Even though the images were of the beautiful quality of Todd-AO, the aspect ratio of the prologue was cropped to approximately 1.85:1 (pretty much the non-widescreen standard of the time). The shots of David were not shown in this sequence.  Just before the end of the prologue, the narrator says, ""... by a sculptor who didn't want to paint.""  Just then the screen size and shape change gloriously to the full Todd-AO size and shape in a single cut.  We are now looking at a much larger image -- slightly taller and considerably wider -- that has an aspect ratio of 2.20:1, rather than about 1.85:  The image on screen at that moment is the first shot of David's gigantic foot. There is no voice over during the shots of David -- the same shots you saw in the DVD version.  Instead there are some mighty notes from a cathedral organ that shake the theater floor the way Todd-AO often can. In the theater, with a 70 mm print, this was a wonderful moment.

259208,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6301628667,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[7, 8]","If you go into THE AGONY AND THE ECSTASY with the idea that you will learn anything factual about Michelangelo, Pope Julius II, the Sistine Chapel, and Renaissance Rome--much less art--you are in for a rude awakening.  Historians were quick to point out that the film was even less historically accurate than the Irving Stone bestseller on which it was based.  Film critics were also harsh: while they described the film as competent, by and large they felt that a movie so crammed with notable talents should have been quite a bit better than it actually was.There is some truth to these accusations.  As a whole, THE AGONY AND THE ECSTASY is essentially a prettified and cleaned-up 1965 idea of the characters and story it offers.  Even the alleys are well-swept and the servant drudges remarkably clean, and in terms of visuals and designs the film is nothing so much than THE SOUND OF MUSIC gone Italian.  The dialogue is remarkably pretentious and the plot extremely repetitive.  And certainly neither Charleton Heston nor Rex Harrison were anything like Michelangelo or Pope Julius II.Even so, the film works unexpectedly well on its own merits.  Heston and Harrison may be incredibly miscast, but they both play with considerable conviction, and their clashing styles lend surprising believability to their scenes together.  While a more accurate portrait of the era would be more interesting, one can't complain about the entertainment value involved; there is always something to see on the screen.  And although director Carol Reed and writer Philip Dunne play fast and loose with the facts, the story they offer is quite entertaining.This is not a great masterpiece of cinema, but it is a lot of fun to watch--as long as you don't take it too seriously as either history or art.  The bonus package is quite slight, but the restoration is very nice, and the film comes with the original and interesting documentary on Michelangelo's works that prefaced it when it was in theatrical release.  While I would not place this on a short of list of films to own, it is a pleasant enough way to spend a rainy night, particularly if you are looking for a film the entire family can watch together.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,Entertaining But Extremely Superficial,1132272000,"11 18, 2005",2005,2219,"['go', 'THE', 'AGONY', 'AND', 'THE', 'ECSTASY', 'idea', 'will', 'learn', 'anything', 'factual', 'Michelangelo', 'Pope', 'Julius', 'II', 'Sistine', 'Chapel', 'Renaissance', 'Rome', 'much', 'less', 'art', 'are', 'rude', 'awakening', 'Historians', 'were', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'film', 'was', 'even', 'less', 'historically', 'accurate', 'Irving', 'Stone', 'bestseller', 'was', 'based', 'Film', 'critics', 'were', 'also', 'harsh', 'described', 'film', 'competent', 'large', 'felt', 'movie', 'so', 'crammed', 'notable', 'talents', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'bit', 'better', 'actually', 'truth', 'accusations', 'whole', 'THE', 'AGONY', 'AND', 'THE', 'ECSTASY', 'essentially', 'prettified', 'cleaned-up', '1965', 'idea', 'characters', 'story', 'Even', 'alleys', 'are', 'well-swept', 'servant', 'drudges', 'remarkably', 'clean', 'terms', 'visuals', 'film', 'nothing', 'so', 'much', 'THE', 'SOUND', 'OF', 'MUSIC', 'gone', 'Italian', 'dialogue', 'remarkably', 'pretentious', 'plot', 'extremely', 'repetitive', 'certainly', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'were', 'anything', 'Michelangelo', 'Pope', 'Julius', 'II.Even', 'so', 'film', 'unexpectedly', 'well', 'own', 'merits', 'Heston', 'Harrison', 'may', 'be', 'incredibly', 'miscast', 'play', 'considerable', 'conviction', 'clashing', 'styles', 'lend', 'surprising', 'believability', 'scenes', 'together', 'more', 'accurate', 'portrait', 'era', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'entertainment', 'value', 'involved', 'always', 'something', 'see', 'screen', 'director', 'Carol', 'Reed', 'writer', 'Philip', 'Dunne', 'play', 'fast', 'loose', 'facts', 'story', 'offer', 'quite', 'entertaining.This', 'not', 'great', 'masterpiece', 'cinema', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'history', 'art', 'bonus', 'package', 'quite', 'slight', 'restoration', 'very', 'nice', 'film', 'original', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'Michelangelo', 'works', 'prefaced', 'when', 'was', 'theatrical', 'release', 'would', 'not', 'place', 'short', 'list', 'films', 'own', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'way', 'spend', 'rainy', 'night', 'particularly', 'are', 'looking', 'film', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'together.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

The technical beauty and historical accuracy of this film is masterful.  Charlton Heston as always gives a melodramatic performance, yet despite its two dimensional aspects, he gives life to Michealangelo.  Its very ironic to see Heston, a man of conservative and right wing views portay the misunderstood artist so well.  Many highlights and themes of the artist's life is portrayed such as his love of sculpture, and even hints of his possible homosexuality.  Just as well is Harrison's portrayal as Julius II.  The interplay between these 2 characters of passion and ego was very entertaining.  Often the life of the artist who truly wants his/her creation to be true to the vision of the mind's eye is one filled with intense passion which often times can be painful.  Many works of art such as the Sistine Chapel took years of intense painstaking labor to accomplish.  It was a life I considered living, and sometimes still think about, and only this movie and perhaps Kirk Douglas's movie Lust for Life have portrayed this life of painful passion well.

Kara Russell ""Actress/Artist/Musician/Writer""","[6, 10]","This film is a classic for all the right reasons: a truly great story of two epic lives entwining, two powerful actors, great Direction by Carol Reed, and luscious, artistic cinematography by Leon Shamroy (Academy Award nominated for Cinematography).Charlton Heston as Michelangelo and Rex Harrison as Pope Julius II (a warrior Pope) bring out the best in each other's performance, the interplay of their strengths driving each other higher. There simply are no weaknesses in these performances.  The screenplay creates some awkward situations, perhaps to move the story along.  I can not say Rex Harrison seems at ease on the battlefield, these scenes are an odd juxtaposition of boardroom at the battlefield, and that does not help. And we don't seem him leading a charge, which makes him look a bit ineffective, but these are directorial and editing choices.The casting of Diane Cilento as the only woman in this piece is the head scratcher.  Out of all the actresses in the world at that time, who did she know to get this role?  In another film her performance would have been fine, on par with other performances at this time, but contrasted to these two gritty leads, her performance seems flat and superficial.  This role could and should have completed a trinity of unrequited obsession, hers being with Michelangelo, but it does not gel, and it is the big disappointment of the film.  Jennifer Jones is the kind of actress who was needed, someone who could be quiet and simple, lusty and strong all at the same time.Still, this is the story of the men, and so perhaps that was part of the Director's intention, women did not have significance at that time, and we feel it in this film.

The work does not go smoothly. After making a start of it, the temperamental artist decides upon a much grander scheme. The pope approves but the problem lies in getting the work done in any reasonable amount of time. Deadline after deadline is passed and still the project is not finished.

Each goads the other into acts that would not otherwise have occurred. In the case of the Michelangelo, that is giving up his beloved sculpture to work with paint. In the case of Julius II, it is the military defense of the Papal States against outside invaders.Charlton Heston does his usual excellent job in his portrayal of the difficult artist. His genuine love of art for art's sake comes through and helps to make the conflict of this film understandable. So too does Rex Harrison do a good job in the Role of Julius II. His stubbornness and force of will sees to it that the chapel is completed. It is for this that he is remembered rather than the preservation of papal autonomy.A good film that hold the interest.",4,A Titanic Clash of Wills,1120953600,"07 10, 2005",2005,1577,"['survey', 'Michelangelo', 'works', 'almost', 'ten', 'minutes', 'are', 'mostly', 'sculptures', 'point', 'made', 'famous', 'artist', 'wanted', 'sculpt', 'not', 'paint', 'Then', 'real', 'story', 'begins.Pope', 'Julius', 'II', 'Michelangelo', 'paint', 'Sistine', 'Chapel', 'ceiling', 'not', 'commission', 'artist', 'forced', 'papal', 'fiat', 'work', 'not', 'go', 'smoothly', 'making', 'start', 'temperamental', 'artist', 'much', 'grander', 'scheme', 'pope', 'problem', 'getting', 'work', 'done', 'reasonable', 'amount', 'time', 'Deadline', 'deadline', 'passed', 'still', 'project', 'not', 'finished', 'everyone', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'finished', 'eventually', 'story', 'battle', 'wills', 'temperamental', 'artist', 'autocratic', 'ruler', 'used', 'having', 'own', 'way', 'other', 'acts', 'would', 'not', 'otherwise', 'have', 'occurred', 'case', 'Michelangelo', 'giving', 'up', 'beloved', 'sculpture', 'work', 'paint', 'case', 'Julius', 'II', 'military', 'defense', 'Papal', 'States', 'invaders.Charlton', 'Heston', 'usual', 'excellent', 'job', 'portrayal', 'difficult', 'artist', 'genuine', 'love', 'art', 'art', 'sake', 'make', 'conflict', 'film', 'understandable', 'So', 'too', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'Role', 'Julius', 'II', 'stubbornness', 'force', 'will', 'sees', 'chapel', 'completed', 'remembered', 'rather', 'preservation', 'papal', 'autonomy.A', 'good', 'film', 'hold', 'interest']",N/A

I was all set to dismiss it as yet another bloated pictorial Hollywood ""epic"" starring the granitic Charlton Heston. As it turns out, though...I kinda like this movie. Sure, it is still a bit overweight for its relatively intimate exploration of the artistic process (even though, of course, Michaelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling fresco is one of the towering works of art in history, so I suppose the treatment is understandable). All the same, I was drawn to its vivid depiction of Michaelangelo's agonies and ecstasies in the creation of his big masterpiece. Heston may not have ever been a truly great actor---he was almost always rather stolid in the movies he was in---but he acquits himself fairly well here as Michaelangelo, and Rex Harrison gives a finely nuanced performance as Pope Julius II, who gave Michaelangelo the commission in the first place. It is a tribute to director Carol Reed and his crew that THE AGONY AND THE ECSTASY can rise above its extra weight and its cliched (and, by all accounts, nonexistent) central romance between Michaelangelo and the Contessina de Medici (Diane Cilento) to deliver a movie that may not bring great insights into the sometimes-painful artistic process, but still manages to be fascinating and compelling about its central subject matter regardless. Of course it's often always beautiful to look at. That's pretty much a given for these kinds of big Hollywood movies. But THE AGONY AND THE ECSTASY turns out to be something more.

259231,A2GPEV42IO41CI,6301628667,Kona,"[10, 12]","This fictionalized account of the painting of the Sistine Chapel ceiling focuses on the battle of wills between the artist, Michelangelo (Charlton Heston), and his patron, Pope Julius II (Rex Harrison).  As the story opens, Michelangelo, already an established sculptor, is commissioned by the warrior Pope to decorate his ceiling.  Michelangelo doesn't want to do it, preferring to concentrate on the 40 statues intended for Julius' tomb.  But the Pope wins that battle, the first of many, for the two men are equally matched in their stubbornness and pride.  The work is detailed against the backdrop of Julius' many military battles and we learn a lot about life during the Renaissance.  There is a relationship with Michelangelo's childhood friend, the Countess of Medici, that  shows his single-minded devotion to his craft.Both Michelangelo and Julius are portrayed as stiff-necked, driven men who use reverse-psychology on each other to get what they want.  The dialogue is literate and yet each line is delivered like a grand speech.  We learn a great deal about Julius as a man and not as much about Michelangelo.  These are bravura performances by Heston and Harrison; they play men with monumental egos and ambitions but infuse them with human faults and foibles.  A wonderful documentary over-view of Michelangelo's work that precedes the film would have been better at the end.  I enjoyed the film almost as much as Irving Stone's novel, and that's saying a lot.Kona",4,"""It's only painted plaster, Your Holiness.""",1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,1479,"['fictionalized', 'account', 'painting', 'Sistine', 'Chapel', 'ceiling', 'focuses', 'battle', 'wills', 'artist', 'Michelangelo', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'patron', 'Pope', 'Julius', 'II', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'story', 'Michelangelo', 'already', 'established', 'sculptor', 'commissioned', 'warrior', 'Pope', 'decorate', 'ceiling', 'Michelangelo', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'preferring', 'concentrate', '40', 'statues', 'intended', 'Julius', 'tomb', 'Pope', 'battle', 'first', 'many', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'equally', 'matched', 'stubbornness', 'pride', 'work', 'detailed', 'backdrop', 'Julius', 'many', 'military', 'battles', 'learn', 'lot', 'life', 'Renaissance', 'relationship', 'Michelangelo', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Countess', 'Medici', 'single-minded', 'devotion', 'craft.Both', 'Michelangelo', 'Julius', 'are', 'portrayed', 'stiff-necked', 'driven', 'men', 'who', 'use', 'reverse-psychology', 'other', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'dialogue', 'literate', 'yet', 'line', 'delivered', 'grand', 'speech', 'learn', 'great', 'deal', 'about', 'Julius', 'man', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'Michelangelo', 'are', 'bravura', 'performances', 'Heston', 'Harrison', 'play', 'men', 'monumental', 'egos', 'ambitions', 'infuse', 'human', 'faults', 'foibles', 'wonderful', 'documentary', 'over-view', 'Michelangelo', 'work', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'end', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'Irving', 'Stone', 'novel', 'saying', 'lot.Kona']",N/A

The show begins by showing a number of Michaelangelo's work, including his work on the Vatican as well as his many sculptures. Many don't realize that he was on the personal payroll of the very rich, very influential Medicci family (fabled to be the blood line of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdeline). When he was hiding from the Pope, the Medicci family hid him for a time. In a deep hallway underneath one of their many homes, his 'grafitti' can still be seen. Of course, he is most well known for his work in the Sistene Chapel, though he never saw himself as a painter. The Pope wouldn't take no for an answer, and threatened him mightily if he didn't finish his work. Michaelangelo was at odds with the Church throughout his life, and his own self importance and ego didn't help. This movie pertrays very well the challenges he faced in his life. Rex Harrison plays Pope Julius II, a better warrior than Pope, who demands that Michaelangelo paint the Sistene Chapel. Charlton Heston is at his best in his portrayal of Michaelangelo, an artist driven by an inner urge that he can't understand.

Suffice it to say that it moves at a leisurely pace, and that the two main actors (Heston and Harrison) take turns mugging, gnashing their teeth and chewing the gorgeous scenery. However, since Amazon's product listing doesn't list the technical specs, here they are:This DVD release of THE AGONY AND THE ECSTASY was made from the original 65mm Todd-AO negative, digitally restored. Aspect ratio is correct at 2.20:1, anamorphically enhanced for widescreen TVs. The colors are deeply saturated, and the picture looks quite sharp, with little grain on my high-end Sony HDTV CRT.The available soundtracks (all Dolby Digital) are 1.0 mono English, 2.0 stereo English, 1.0 mono French and 1.0 mono Spanish. (Contrary to what another reviewer here says, there is NO 5.1 surround soundtrack -- a sorry deficiency for a film originally released in 6-track.) IMPORTANT: On my copy of the disc, the DEFAULT soundtrack is the 1.0 mono English. There is no separate menu for selecting the audio you want, so you must press the AUDIO button on your DVD remote ONCE to get the 2.0 stereo English soundtrack. You'd think Fox would want people to hear the stereo track by default!The good news is that the 2.0 stereo track is very clean, with the original 5-channel screen spread and directional dialogue faithfully preserved. It's not as full and crisp as a modern soundtrack, but remember that this was recorded forty years ago. If you listen with headphones, it's easy to hear how much of the dialog was re-recorded on a dubbing stage. In a few intimate scenes, though, the whirring of the camera is faintly audible.Alex North's score has some nifty stereo effects, even if the title theme is disturbingly reminiscent of Strauss' Also Sprach Zarathustra.The disc includes the complete roadshow presentation: modern-day introduction (with beautiful aerial photography and closeups of Michelangelo masterpieces), intermission music, entr'acte music and exit music. There is also a demonstration of the 65mm restoration process, and some trailers of other Fox epics from the 50s and 60s, including THE ROBE and THE BIBLE.

259246,A3ET9OE3TQ9OEJ,6301628667,Nix Pix,"[0, 2]","After a decade of declining profits in Hollywood where Biblical epics were concerned, Twentieth Century Fox's &quot;The Agony and The Ecstasy&quot; (1966) managed to recapture much of the glory, if not the box office, of that sort of 50s storytelling without getting too religous. Charlton Heston and Rex Harrison star as two of the Renaissance's most explosive and emotional titans; the great sculptor/painter, Michelangelo and Pope Julius II. Julius is a tyrannical, often crass, dictator who's true aspirations are for the ultimate glory of Rome and preservation of the Catholic church. To this end he will stop at nothing to inspire his people and ignite controversy amongst the clergy. Michelangelo's career as sculptor par excellence is sidetracked when Julius orders him to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. &quot;But I'm not a painter,&quot; Michelangelo explains. All evidence to the contrary.The battle of wills that ensues is heavy on melodrama but rather flat on inspiration. As Michelangelo, Heston is solid, stoic and virtuous - a sort of Moses with a paint brush. What he ultimately lacks is any real conviction as one of the artsy set. Also, knowning as we do today that Michelangelo was not interested in women romantically, per say, Heston's faux romance with Contessina de Medici (Diane Cilento) is grossly misleading from a historical perpsective. What is compelling about this sometimes stagy, rather long-winded film is the way in which Heston and Harrison's unique acting styles spar off of one another. Director, Carol Reed, whose greatest contribution to cinema will forever be &quot;The Third Man&quot;, on this occasion, fills the vast expanse of Panavision with lush photographic set pieces that strangely are cold and disengaging. Overall the film does fall short of expectations, but it remains immaculate craftsmanship from an era in film-making in which such attention to every detail was simply par for the course.Fox's DVD faithfully returns the film to its original visual vibrance. The color by DeLuxe is rich and very nicely balanced. For decades this film's magenta layer had been so severely faded that for most of its running time the flesh tones and backgrounds looked as though they were suffering from severe sunburn. These oversights, as well as shortcomings in film grain and age related artifacts, have all been corrected. What is still obtusive about the picture quality is its excessive edge enhancement. On widescreen televisions it is barely noticeable. On regular picture tubes, horizontal and vertical lines on much of the Italian architecture shimmer uncontrollably. Quite distracting. The audio is 5.1 surround, remastered from the original six track recording. Yet the audio falls short of expectations. It's slightly muffled and not very aggressive even when the swell of music grows from the side and rear channels. Extras include theatrical trailers for several Fox releases as well as this one. Overall, then, this presentation of &quot;The Agony And The Ecstacy&quot; is still something of a compromise for the home theater audience, as much of a compromise as the film is itself with regards to taking history directly and seriously.",4,More Agony Than Ecstacy in this Lengthy Clash of Wills,1109980800,"03 5, 2005",2005,3201,"['decade', 'declining', 'profits', 'Hollywood', 'where', 'Biblical', 'epics', 'were', 'concerned', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', 'quot', 'Agony', 'Ecstasy', 'quot', '1966', 'managed', 'recapture', 'much', 'glory', 'not', 'box', 'office', 'sort', '50s', 'storytelling', 'getting', 'too', 'religous', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'star', 'two', 'Renaissance', 'most', 'explosive', 'emotional', 'titans', 'great', 'sculptor/painter', 'Michelangelo', 'Pope', 'Julius', 'II', 'Julius', 'tyrannical', 'often', 'crass', 'dictator', 'who', 'true', 'aspirations', 'are', 'ultimate', 'glory', 'Rome', 'preservation', 'Catholic', 'church', 'end', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'inspire', 'people', 'ignite', 'controversy', 'amongst', 'clergy', 'Michelangelo', 'career', 'sculptor', 'par', 'excellence', 'sidetracked', 'when', 'Julius', 'orders', 'paint', 'ceiling', 'Sistine', 'Chapel', 'quot', ""'m"", 'not', 'painter', 'quot', 'Michelangelo', 'evidence', 'contrary.The', 'battle', 'wills', 'ensues', 'heavy', 'melodrama', 'rather', 'flat', 'inspiration', 'Michelangelo', 'Heston', 'solid', 'stoic', 'virtuous', 'sort', 'Moses', 'paint', 'brush', 'What', 'ultimately', 'real', 'conviction', 'one', 'artsy', 'set', 'Also', 'knowning', 'do', 'today', 'Michelangelo', 'was', 'not', 'interested', 'women', 'romantically', 'say', 'Heston', 'faux', 'romance', 'Contessina', 'de', 'Medici', 'Diane', 'Cilento', 'grossly', 'misleading', 'historical', 'perpsective', 'What', 'compelling', 'sometimes', 'stagy', 'rather', 'long-winded', 'film', 'way', 'Heston', 'Harrison', 'unique', 'acting', 'styles', 'spar', 'one', 'Director', 'Carol', 'Reed', 'greatest', 'contribution', 'cinema', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'quot', 'Third', 'Man', 'quot', 'occasion', 'vast', 'expanse', 'Panavision', 'lush', 'photographic', 'set', 'pieces', 'strangely', 'are', 'cold', 'disengaging', 'film', 'fall', 'short', 'expectations', 'immaculate', 'craftsmanship', 'era', 'film-making', 'such', 'attention', 'detail', 'was', 'simply', 'par', 'course.Fox', 'DVD', 'faithfully', 'film', 'original', 'visual', 'vibrance', 'color', 'DeLuxe', 'rich', 'very', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'decades', 'film', 'magenta', 'layer', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'severely', 'faded', 'most', 'running', 'time', 'flesh', 'tones', 'backgrounds', 'looked', 'were', 'suffering', 'severe', 'sunburn', 'oversights', 'as', 'well', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'grain', 'age', 'related', 'artifacts', 'have', 'been', 'corrected', 'What', 'still', 'obtusive', 'picture', 'quality', 'excessive', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'widescreen', 'televisions', 'barely', 'noticeable', 'regular', 'picture', 'tubes', 'horizontal', 'vertical', 'lines', 'much', 'Italian', 'architecture', 'shimmer', 'uncontrollably', 'Quite', 'distracting', 'audio', '5.1', 'surround', 'remastered', 'original', 'six', 'track', 'recording', 'audio', 'short', 'expectations', 'slightly', 'muffled', 'not', 'very', 'aggressive', 'even', 'when', 'swell', 'music', 'grows', 'side', 'rear', 'channels', 'Extras', 'include', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'several', 'Fox', 'releases', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'Overall', 'then', 'presentation', 'quot', 'Agony', 'Ecstacy', 'quot', 'still', 'something', 'compromise', 'home', 'theater', 'audience', 'much', 'compromise', 'film', 'regards', 'taking', 'history', 'directly', 'seriously']",N/A

For some reason, though, I picked this up from the library and hesitantly put it in the dvd player, knowing I could eject it at any moment.It opens with a lovely presentation of the sculpture of Michaelangelo which captured me and kept me watching through the feature.  Heston was not a bad as I had feared, although he does portray more agony than ecstasy. I kept thinking that he must have had happy moments since he lived till his upper 80's and no one could survive that many years of constant torment.  However we don't know how much of the film is real and how much is fiction.  That's the problem.  It gave me enough of a taste of the political situation of the time to want to know the truth, but here we have to be satisfied with Hollywood's version.Rex Harrison was an unexpected pleasure as the Pope, Michaelangelo's adversary and benefactor. I found him to be much more engaging and convincing in his unsympathetic role than Heston as the hero. There is a minor character, a woman in the Medici family, who is in love with Michaelangelo and helps him during various times of crisis.  I wondered how much of that was true, but again, for historical accuracy one must look elsewhere.It is visually quite splendid and the plot moves right along.  The shots of the Sistine chapel are a treat.  There are a few scenes that stand out and make this more than a docu-drama of ""How the Sistine Chapel was Painted.""  One is the scene where MA, in the mountains, while hiding out from the Pope, has a sort of cloudy vision which gives him the idea of how to paint the chapel.  It could have been corny, and well, maybe it was a little, but I found it actually quite well done, if not actually inspiring.The best scene was one where the Pope, badly injured from battle, has managed to climb up the scaffolding at night by himself, to inspect the painting.  MA finds him up there, with his candle, peering at the image of God.  There follows a conversation which probably never happened, but was a nice idea, in which MA assures the Pope that God is loving, not hateful and that man is essentially innocent.  These happy thoughts seem tacked on to please the viewers but what was genuinely moving was to see the old, cranky Pope actually loving the painting.If you are not hooked on historical accuracy and are willing to see Charlton Heston look pained for several hours, you may enjoy this film.

259255,A5ZUZ49YRDPCV,6301628667,Rachel Garret,"[5, 6]","1965: Carol Reed, director of &quot;The Third Man&quot; produces a superb film about the life of the Renaissance master artist and sculptor, Michaelangelo, based on the novel by Irving Stone. Who would have thought that Charlton Heston, the 50's and 60's actor most known for his heroic masculine, larger than life roles such as Moses from &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; would play the peaceful, pensive artist who created the world's most beautiful cathedral, the Sistine Chapel. Irving Stone's novel focuses on this period in Michaelangelo's life, especially his prominence in Florentine society. The film revolves around Michaelangelo's commission by Pope Julius II to create the Sistine Chapel, a timeless masterpiece for all the ages. In doing so, Michaelangelo takes a tremendous risk, for the Pope can be a very fierce man- at one point he even slaps Michaelangelo.Historical inaccuracies pop up as is always the case in historic fiction. For example, Michaelangelo's painting of &quot;The Creation of Man&quot; (God reaching out his hand to touch Adam with life) is portrayed here as Michaelangelo drawing inspiration from the heavens themselves- a ray of light from a cloud. There is romance to the film, not only in aesthetic sense, but in a subplot involving the daughter of a Renaissance art patron who falls for Michaelangelo.The rest is purely a feast for the eyes- the high views of Florence with its towering cathedrals and bell towers, the Pieta statues, the Sistine Chapel's interior, fountains and Italian villages. Rex Harris (My Fair Lady) portrays the seemingly indifferent Pope, who is troubled by unrest and war. The relationship between Michaelangelo and Pope Julius is truly the most striking aspect of the drama.Both Rex Harrison and Charlton Heston should have won Oscars for roles which were outside their mainstream performances. The Pope and Michaelangelo have a intense relationship, one of compromise, one of admiration and loyalty, one of devotion to God. Michaelangelo as an individual is of course the very essence of this film, particularily as he struggles with social issues and inner conflict to paint the Sistine Chapel.The Agony and the Ecstasy is just that- the pain of creation, or &quot;giving birth&quot; to something so magnificent and  the pleasure and enjoyment of the finished work in the end. Of course this can apply to the fundamentalist view of God's creation, who &quot;rested&quot; after making the world and found it to be &quot;good&quot;.

Crawford,"[0, 0]","I remember watching this as a boy, focusing entirely on the work of Michelangelo and his difficult relationship with a Pope, but feeling clueless about the history.  So I was very curious what it would be like, especially watching it with my kids, who like history much more than I did at their ages.The film starts out slow, with what can only be described as a pedantic mess,  with a flat narrator talking about Michelangelo's work.  It is more than 10 minutes and almost deterred the lot of us from waiting for the film drama to start.  That being said, once the film started we were swept into it and watched with fascination.  My kids had many questions, about the conflict between the two men, but also about what was happening in the Renaissance and why Pope Julius II was fighting the French and Germans in Vatican territories of Italy.  This absolutely delighted me and hence I would recommend this film as a wonderful family viewing experience.  My kids enjoyed it, in particular because they have seen many of the sculptures and even the Sistine Chapel when they lived in Italy.  Finally, the beauty of the work comes through, as does the subtlety of Michelangelo's views when compared to those of the embittered warrior Pope.I do have some criticisms of the film.  First, it skirts the issue of Michelangelo's sexuality by having a Medici wife in love with him.  While she is interesting as a wily courtier, it is a bit maudlin.  Second, it makes the relationship - which was stormy - between Michelangelo and the Pope into a kind of melodrama, with Michelangelo inspiring him to soldier on and in some philosophical discussion about the nature of God and man.

His name is closely linked with those of great artists such Bramante, Raphael and Michelangelo... With his wealth of visionary ideas, he contributed to their creativity... Although he had little of the priest in him, he was concerned - toward the end - only with the church's grandeur... He wished for greatness for the papacy rather than for the pope, and for peace in Italy...The film shows the extraordinary violent temper of the Pope, his lost of his self-control and his rude behavior towards the Florentine when he shouts: 'He will paint it or he will hang!'But, in one scene, he explains to Michelangelo his reasons: 'If I had not become a conqueror, there would be no church, no pontiff, no hope for peace for mankind and, I might add, no patrons for sculpture, painting, and architecture.'""The Agony and the Ecstasy"" is a proof of faith and a battle of wills... The pope continually asks Michelangelo: 'When you will make an end of it?' and the answer of Buonarotti is invariably the same: 'When I'm finished!'But despite these recurrent strains imposed on their relations by the two overly similar personalities, their relationship is so close that the Pope becomes, in fact, Michelangelo's intellectual collaborator... The paintings are in form and conception, a product of the artistic symbiosis of two towering figures of the 16th Century-Italy...Two breathtaking moments of the motion picture are to be mention: The 'Inspiration' scene where the clouds were forming the focal points of Michelangelo's Frescos; and the great sequence of meditation between the Pope and Buonarotti in front of the creation panel...The supporting cast include: Harry Andrews playing the Italian architect of the Renaissance Bramante; Tomas Milian as Raphael, the master of the Italian High Renaissance style; and Diane Cilento as Contessina Medici, the woman who drives Michelangelo to search his heart for important paths of activity...The film - an ecstasy for those who love and appreciate great art and powerful work - is a huge spectacle, a rich dramatization, moving and fascinating...The picture ends by another commission of the Pope to Michelangelo, another huge work, full of swirling figures and terrible images of despair, the powerful fresco: 'The Last Judgment', the ceiling behind the high altar... Michelangelo's continuous argument is heard: 'I still say painting is not my trade!' and, obviously, the Pope response: 'To work, my son!'And what a huge work Michelangelo left... A breve documentary demonstrates before the beginning of the motion picture: The Pieta of St. Peter's; The Colossal David; and The Moses.Pope John Paul II led a ceremony December ll, 1999 celebrating the completion of the two-decade restoration of the Sistine Chapel...

259269,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6301628667,Simon Davis,"[3, 4]","No movie no matter how detailed its research and visual scope, would ever be able to properly capture the true magnificence of the ceiling in the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. Having seen the paintings on two occasions in Rome one can't help but be awed by their brilliance and vividness brought to life as they were by the legendary sculptor/painter Michelangelo. Twentieth Century Fox's lavish production of ""The Agony and the Ecstasy"", which chronicles the trials, tribulations, personality clashes, and sheer back breaking work that went into the realisation of one of the world's greatest art masterpices however does come close in my belief to showing how it would have been during its creation. Attacked by critics for its supposedly florid melodrama, theatrical performances, and unconvincing characters, I think this film is long overdue for a reappraisal as a recent screening revealed to me the many wonderful qualities that this film possesses.Based on the novel by Irving Stone, ""The Agony and the Ecstasy"", chronicles  the battle of wills that breaks out between Pope Julius II, (Rex Harrison), best known as the warrior Pope and his chief artisan Michelangelo (Charlton Heston) over the Pope's commission to the artist to paint the entire ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. Michelangelo initially refuses the job as he sees himself purely as a sculptor and is in the middle of planning an elaborate tomb for the Pope. Backing down Michelangelo reluctantly begins the huge task with a composition based on the Twelve Apostles however the work goes slowly and is not up to the rigid standards that the artist has set for himself. Harrassed by both Pope Julius and his chief architect Donato Bramante (Harry Andrews), Michelangelo eventually destroys the completed panels and flees Rome. With Pope Julius fighting for his life in the wars in Italy Michelangelo has a change of heart and after receiving a pardon from Julius he begins creating a new scheme dealing with the Old Testament stories. The battle of wills between the two men however never subsides for one minute and Michelangelo's temper is often openly directed towards his Holiness with little of the resepct that Julius is used to in his position. The state of play continues through the long period it takes to complete the huge task of painting the ceiling. The time spent on the commission however produces another unexpected result when a new grudging appreciation of each man's unique qualities begins to develop between Julius and Michelangelo which is only revealed briefly before the men begin fighting against each other over the Pope's next commission for Michelangelo.Despite its scope, drama and large supporting cast ""The Agony and the Ecstasy"", is essentially a two character study and I personally was very impressed by both lead actors performances here despite the critics at the time being divided as to their merits. Rex Harrison was at this time enjoying a boom in his career having just completed his Oscar winning role in ""My Fair Lady"", and having also picked up another nomination as Best Actor the year before that for ""Cleopatra"". He makes a most convincing Pope Julius II, all bombastic wind and possessing that arrogant quality that Harrison was so expert at conveying on screen which was just right for the part here. He looks every inch a Pope and he is excellent in those many scenes when he is squaring off against his rebellious chief artist Michelangelo who refuses to be either awed or bullied by him. One of the chief delights of Harrison's performance is shown in the growing frustration that Pope Julius experiences in trying to hurry Michelangelo along to complete his work with their encounters taking on an almost comic tone with his repeated frantic query of ""when will you finish?"" being regularly answered with a vague ""when I'm finished"" by an unfazed Michelangelo. The brunt of the criticism on the casting has always been directed at Charlton Heston's choice as the famed Italian painter. I in fact find him perfectly cast as the dedicated painter who reluctantly took on the task of creating one of the world's enduring masterpices. Despite being American somehow he is perfect for the role and conveys beautifully the frustration that Michelanglo felt when this unwelcome commission took him away from his beloved sculpturing. Harrison and Heston have a perfect chemistry as the two antagonists in ""The Agony and the Ecstasy"", and without that this story would have most definately fallen flat. Supporting performances are very much background decoration here however Diane Cilento as Michelangelo's frustrated love interest the Contessina de Medici, and Adolfo Celi as her brother, and Michelangelo's mentor Cardinal Giovanni de Medici, manage to convey the right Renaissance feel in their parts and visually their costumes combined with the sumptuous interiors of their Palace are some of the richest elements in the overall films. This rich look is the thing that overwhelms me each time I see this movie. Nominated for a stunning five Academy Awards including a much deserved one for cinematography, more than anything else in this production it is the use of especially rich colours that are a real stand out and are of course totally appropriate since the story deals with the realisation of a major painting project. The incredible rich blues employed by Michelanglo in his scenes painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and especially the blood red colour frequently employed in the interior decoration of the Papal Palace and in the Papal robes worn by Rex Harrison gives the film a breathtakingly opulent and regal feel. Certainly the rich look and feel of ""The Agony and the Ecstasy"", are some of its strong points and make it essential viewing  for any lover of lavish historical interiors and costuming.Recreating history on film always seems to be a risky undertaking given many film maker's habit of attempting to ""improve"", on the actual facts however I feel that with ""The Agony and the Ecstasy"",that we have a fairly accurate examination of the real agony and ecstasy that went into the creation of the paintings on the Sistine Chapel ceiling. The famous line from the script uttered by Michelangelo ""I planned a ceiling, he planned a miracle"", beautifully  illustrates the two very often conflicting viewpoints of the two very different and quite extraordinary men who by some miracle in their stormy relationship with each managed to create one of the world's greatest masterpieces. Art lovers couldn't help but appreciate the turmoil and indeed agony that went into creating such a thing of beauty as the Sistine Chapel ceiling and this film pays great tribute to that artistic process. Unfairly dismmissed by critics at the time I feel this effort is one of the better biographical films from this mid 1960's period and deserves to be better remembered than it currently is.

259271,A1DBBW9T4NW25T,6301628667,Stephen John Vogel,"[1, 4]","Seeing this film on DVD forty-six years after it was first released, I was left decidedly ambivalent as to its quality, but with rather more disappointment than delight.Though I'd heard that as drama it was tepid fare, the pacing seemed even more lackadaisical than I'd anticipated. Such dramatic tension as exists can be reduced to the question ""Will Michaelangelo ever finish painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel?""  And since there can be few viewers over the age of, say, twelve who are in doubt as to the answer, the suspense is minimal. As for dramatic confrontation, we can enjoy the battle of wills between the artist and the pope, Julius II, who commissioned the frescoes, but when such pedestrian dialogue as we find here is uttered by two familiar stars of the 50s and 60s, Charlton Heston and Rex Harrison, the verbal jousting seldom rises above the banter associated with most Hollywood costume dramas of that era. And though not exactly boring, this movie, with its 138 minute running time, doesn't exactly fly by. We can be grateful that the film comes with an intermission, since otherwise some of us would create (at least) one, using our remotes. So much for the admittedly minor agony of watching a long, often ponderous movie.On the other hand, the film does have some wonderful treats, mostly for the eye. Costumes and set design are sumptuous. The location scenes in Italy do well in evoking the early 16th Century in Italy. And best of all, there is a mini-documentary at the very beginning of the movie that surveys  Michaelangelo's various works of sculpture in all their virtuosic glory. Viewers who stop the DVD when this is over, before the actual film has begun, should certainly be forgiven. Arguably, they have seen the best of what The Agony and the Ecstasy has to offer.If they do watch until the end, as I did, they might well enjoy the portrayal of one or both of the two main characters. My preference is for Harrison's wily and willful Julius over Heston's stubborn and visionary Michaelangelo. The image of the creative genius as presented in this movie, passionate, obsessive and a bit wild-eyed, is sort of standard fare for biographical films of this kind; not many variations on that theme here. More unusual is the depiction of a pope who was (historically as well as  cinematically) both a military as well as a religious leader. It's instructive to be reminded that the  the Papal States were a temporal, no less than a spiritual, power during the Renaissance, and that the titular head of Christendom would sometimes ride into battle, clad in armor, against the Christian kings who, in theory at least, bowed to his religious authority. Harrison, as he did portraying Julius Caesar in the 1963 Cleopatra, is adept at suggesting a robust warrior, but one no less capable in an intellectual or artistic environment.  Still, as he did with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in the earlier film, Rex Harrison tends to overshadow his co-star in The Agony and the Ecstasy, so that when Heston's artist is deprived of his papal sparring partner, the film loses what little claim to ecstasy it may be said to possess, aside from the artwork, of course.",3,"A Little Agony,  a Bit of Ecstasy",1322352000,"11 27, 2011",2011,3197,"['Seeing', 'film', 'DVD', 'forty-six', 'years', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'was', 'left', 'decidedly', 'ambivalent', 'quality', 'rather', 'more', 'disappointment', ""'d"", 'heard', 'drama', 'was', 'tepid', 'fare', 'pacing', 'seemed', 'even', 'more', 'lackadaisical', ""'d"", 'anticipated', 'Such', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'exists', 'can', 'be', 'reduced', 'question', 'Will', 'Michaelangelo', 'ever', 'finish', 'painting', 'ceiling', 'Sistine', 'Chapel', 'can', 'be', 'few', 'viewers', 'age', 'say', 'twelve', 'who', 'are', 'doubt', 'answer', 'suspense', 'minimal', 'dramatic', 'confrontation', 'can', 'enjoy', 'battle', 'wills', 'artist', 'pope', 'Julius', 'II', 'who', 'commissioned', 'frescoes', 'when', 'such', 'pedestrian', 'dialogue', 'find', 'here', 'uttered', 'two', 'familiar', 'stars', '50s', '60s', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'verbal', 'jousting', 'seldom', 'banter', 'associated', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'costume', 'dramas', 'era', 'not', 'exactly', 'boring', 'movie', '138', 'minute', 'running', 'time', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'fly', 'can', 'be', 'grateful', 'film', 'intermission', 'otherwise', 'would', 'create', 'least', 'one', 'using', 'remotes', 'So', 'much', 'admittedly', 'minor', 'agony', 'watching', 'long', 'often', 'ponderous', 'movie.On', 'other', 'hand', 'film', 'have', 'wonderful', 'treats', 'mostly', 'eye', 'Costumes', 'set', 'design', 'are', 'sumptuous', 'location', 'scenes', 'Italy', 'do', 'well', 'evoking', 'early', '16th', 'Century', 'Italy', 'best', 'mini-documentary', 'very', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Michaelangelo', 'various', 'works', 'sculpture', 'virtuosic', 'glory', 'Viewers', 'who', 'stop', 'DVD', 'when', 'over', 'actual', 'film', 'begun', 'should', 'certainly', 'be', 'forgiven', 'Arguably', 'have', 'seen', 'best', 'what', 'Agony', 'Ecstasy', 'offer.If', 'do', 'watch', 'end', 'did', 'might', 'well', 'enjoy', 'portrayal', 'one', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'preference', 'Harrison', 'wily', 'willful', 'Julius', 'Heston', 'stubborn', 'visionary', 'Michaelangelo', 'image', 'creative', 'genius', 'presented', 'movie', 'passionate', 'obsessive', 'bit', 'wild-eyed', 'sort', 'standard', 'fare', 'biographical', 'films', 'kind', 'not', 'many', 'variations', 'theme', 'here', 'More', 'unusual', 'depiction', 'pope', 'who', 'was', 'historically', 'as', 'well', 'cinematically', 'military', 'as', 'well', 'religious', 'leader', 'instructive', 'be', 'reminded', 'Papal', 'States', 'were', 'temporal', 'less', 'spiritual', 'power', 'Renaissance', 'titular', 'head', 'Christendom', 'would', 'sometimes', 'ride', 'battle', 'clad', 'armor', 'Christian', 'kings', 'who', 'theory', 'least', 'bowed', 'religious', 'authority', 'Harrison', 'did', 'portraying', 'Julius', 'Caesar', '1963', 'Cleopatra', 'adept', 'suggesting', 'robust', 'warrior', 'one', 'less', 'capable', 'intellectual', 'artistic', 'environment', 'Still', 'did', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'earlier', 'film', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'overshadow', 'co-star', 'Agony', 'Ecstasy', 'so', 'when', 'Heston', 'artist', 'deprived', 'papal', 'sparring', 'partner', 'film', 'what', 'little', 'claim', 'ecstasy', 'may', 'be', 'said', 'possess', 'aside', 'artwork', 'course']",N/A

The settings, costumes, and cast are excellent for the film shot mostly in Rome.  Perhaps it is a little lose about the actual history and portrayal of main players, but the essential feature of the story is the work of Michaelangelo played sensitively by Charlton Heston.  Rex Harrison does very well cast as Pope Julius, who hired the reticent and reluctant Michaelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel.  This is the principal setting for the movie.  Michaelangelo believed he was not a painter, but rather a sculptor.  The resulting exceptional frescoes are executed with dimension and depth, which have no match anywhere.

They don't make movies like this anymore. It begins with a short historical introduction, focusing on the work of the artist. Several of Michaelangelo's sculptures are featured. The extraordinary life-like detail of his statuary in marble is incredible. Even more astounding, is the fact that he carved some of these masterworks at the age of 17!Having explored a number of museums in the past, and remembering some of the truly laughable excuses for ""modern art"" submitted for our perusal, I had to ask myself: How many modern ""artists"", in our modern age, would be capable of emulating such work? In fact, how many 17 year olds, in our time, could/would aspire to even attempt such works? Oh, how far Western art has fallen...The story commences as Michaelangelo, primarily a sculptor, is commissioned (coerced) into the vast project of painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.
