I'm just going to tell you about the good and the bad.The good thing about Gasaraki is it has a very deep plot and the termonology describing the giant robots sound realistic. It's definitely not for kids. The animation is also very realistic, the characters are more in proportion to real life people.I think Gasaraki's major flaw is there is hardly any character development and it's almost a little too real. The whole story is centered around the technology, philosophy, and conflict of the story- not on the characters. There is absolutely no humor. Even when the people try to be funny, it's crushed by the extremely serious mood. It was hard for me to become attached to any of the characters with all the conflict and technology mumbo jumbo. I also wasn't a big fan of how the world looked very similar to our present day world. I would have preferred more Sci Fi scenery.Gasaraki left me with a cold feeling. I felt like I was watching a war documentary. If you like that sort of stuff, then you should like Gasaraki. But you should avoid this anime if you like shows where there are many characters with tons of personality.",2,Want to Sleep...,1109894400,"03 4, 2005",2005,1216,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'plot', 'can', 'get', 'description', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'tell', 'good', 'bad.The', 'good', 'thing', 'Gasaraki', 'very', 'deep', 'plot', 'termonology', 'describing', 'giant', 'robots', 'sound', 'realistic', 'definitely', 'not', 'kids', 'animation', 'also', 'very', 'realistic', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'proportion', 'real', 'life', 'people.I', 'think', 'Gasaraki', 'major', 'flaw', 'hardly', 'character', 'development', 'almost', 'little', 'too', 'real', 'whole', 'story', 'centered', 'technology', 'philosophy', 'conflict', 'story-', 'not', 'characters', 'absolutely', 'humor', 'Even', 'when', 'people', 'try', 'be', 'funny', 'crushed', 'extremely', 'serious', 'mood', 'was', 'hard', 'become', 'attached', 'characters', 'conflict', 'technology', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'fan', 'how', 'world', 'looked', 'very', 'similar', 'present', 'day', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'more', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'scenery.Gasaraki', 'left', 'cold', 'feeling', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'war', 'documentary', 'like', 'sort', 'stuff', 'then', 'should', 'like', 'Gasaraki', 'should', 'avoid', 'anime', 'like', 'shows', 'where', 'are', 'many', 'characters', 'tons', 'personality']",Gasaraki - Perfect Collection

This is one of those mechas where you have the standard teen pilots, ambiguous blue-haired girl, and secret organization.  That said, the series is really an attempt to lay a Noh drama on top of the mecha story and requires some background on Noh theatre to really appreciate.  Anyway, approach it as a Noh piece and you will see what an impressive attempt this series really is.It isn't a perfect series as the complexity of the story adds confusion where less may have been more.  This is a series that relies on lots of text (with the newscasters serving as a type of Noh chorus) and at times, there's simply too much going on.  Some episodes simply end, but this may be a preference (on my part) of episodes which can be self-contained as well as appreciated on the whole.

(but watch it on TV or borrow it from a friend)`Gasaraki' starts off slowly but has a nice narrative hook. A very original universe. The UN sends in troops to stop ethnic war  in a Bosnia type country. A real life universe! (with only the names changed) But American armored units, Abrams Tanks and Bradley APCs (for those of you not up to date in war news, Abrams and Bradleys are light years ahead of any other tank) suffer a drastic defeat at the hands of enemy mobile suits. That's right, real life mobile suits!!! In a real army!!! In a real war!!!Fortunately for the UN a giant Japanese corporation Gowa has been developing giant mobile suits for just such a war. But now Gowa has its sights set on more than just being soldiers for hire. Gowa wants to AVENGE JAPAN'S LOSS IN WWII.The plot is further complicated by the mobile suit pilots' digging further into the Gasaraki mobile suit program. It turns out that mobile suits are not entirely the result of science. They are the result of conjuring Japanese demons and giving them physical form.`Gasaraki' starts off with some very original concepts, what if mobile suits really did exist? Would evil dictators try to take on the UN and fear no one? Would global corporations fear no one? And most importantly, with enough power, would the Japanese ever try to avenge WWII? These are the burning questions which kept me interested throughout `Gasaraki'. It was very realistic; I recall only one joke during the entire series.None of these questions are answered by `Gasaraki'. The story slowly goes nowhere. There is no war, there are no battles. `Gasaraki' degenerates into a boring mindscape into the human soul. If Cartoon Network ever runs this, it might be worth your time but `Gasaraki' is not worth your money.I strongly recommend `Full Metal Panic.' It's a similar story, except a comedy.

712282,A3DM6UGX44NJ9K,B00006CY42,"Daigo Parry ""Hodor""","[40, 47]","The Gasaraki premise is unique and intriguing: only two people--young Yoshiro Gowa and Miharu, both opposing &quot;pilots&quot;--are blessed with the ability as &quot;kai&quot; to summon the Gasaraki, a powerfuly, mysterious, but extremely destructive force. As kai, they are also endowed with wonderful physical abilities, such as extreme endurance, and the ability to raise and maintain their pulse rates at exceeding two to three hundred beats per minute, a quality that makes them ideal pilots of battle-ready robots thrown into the mix in a middle-eastern war.A 3.5 star rating would be more appropriate for this series which seems to show so much promise. The art is of a newer sort that promises to be the medium in which all subsequent anime will follow: cleaner, flatter characters, drawn more thickly and with less of the lines that make some anime attractive. The main characters, Yoshiro and Miharu are extremely inviting and well-developed characters. The battle scenes are fluid, and the designs for the kugai (as the legend goes, the kai perform a Noh Dance to summon the Gasaraki, which takes or kills the kai, leaving a kugai--a primal, predator-looking giant robot in the Eva mode) are spectacular. The movie moves at a good consistent pace, with few slow spots, and the important section flashing back to the history of the kai in ancient Japan is extremely compelling, and could survive as a show on its own. Yet how does it fail?The biggest culprit is in its ambition. The plot is extremely heavy and disorganized, loaded with plenty of philosophy, politics, legend, and politics. And politics. This would have been okay if it had the background story and character development to support it, but other than Yoshiro and Miharu, the characters are all given fluctuating levels of importance, with little or no exploration of who they are. There are so many characters anyway that doing that would be impossible. To better muddle through Gasaraki, separate characters into these groups before watching:Yoshiro and Miharu, the kai/pilots; the Gowa corporation, Yoshiro's family, which basically rules Japan; the Symbol corporation, most noted by its CEO; Yoshiro's squad mates on Japan's battle mecha team; the US, Japan, and another Middle Eastern countries as separate entities; and a side group that includes Yoshiro's younger sister, mother, and Noh dance teacher.Understanding that these groups exist and that they each have their own motivations will hopefully be helpful. It's a good watch, but requires plenty of patience. The ending is almost a side note to the climactic section on the kai flashbacks.

712285,A19UE3BCKEBG4S,B00006CY42,hr,"[10, 14]","The success of an anime series hinges on many factors, such as animation, plot, and character development, and Gasaraki does not fail to satisfy on any of these departments. However, the plot is probably a bit too convoluted and excessively drawn out, which can make the otherwise good story seem boring. This is indeed a detriment, as one can start watching the series from the 13th episode, as it succinctly summarizes and clarifies the previous 12. It's much like watching DBZ. One can start at any saga one wishes and fully understand what's going on within that arc, yet he/she will not be knowledgeable of the back story.Also, do not be misled by the heavy use of mecha as advertising art, as mecha battles are minimal, and personal problems and international disputes abound, and there is even a good dose of mysticism as well, perhaps more than one may initially expect. Gasaraki should be viewed for the story and not for the action, much like the original Gundam series from 1979, but unlike that seminal series Gasaraki isn't as interesting. Although many people prefer the original Japanese voice actors, the English actors presented on this series perform splendidly and do not fail to capture the emotions, or lack thereof in some instances, conveyed by the characters. However, the actor for one of the SSDF's captains (his name escapes me) annoyingly resembles Humphrey Bogart and the orangutan from the 1980s American cartoon show, Shirt Tails. His voice was completely unbefitting for the role, especially in such a serious series such as this.Despite my somewhat harsh criticism, I found Gasaraki quite enjoyable. The animation is by far among the best I have seen, and the story, as complex and elaborate as it was, had a magnetic quality that prevented me from leaving the television. I believe that fans of Japanese voice actors should watch this series in English without apprehension due to the superb job of the English actors (with exception to the orangutan). Additionally, Gasaraki is a rather pleasant alternative to the typical action, magic, mecha, etc. anime out there that most people should enjoy. (Although this series is shrouded in mysticism, the overall militaristic nature has a stronger hold on the viewer).",4,"Mecha, mysticism, and intrigue, oh my!",1029283200,"08 14, 2002",2002,2247,"['success', 'anime', 'series', 'hinges', 'many', 'factors', 'such', 'animation', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'Gasaraki', 'not', 'fail', 'satisfy', 'departments', 'However', 'plot', 'probably', 'bit', 'too', 'convoluted', 'excessively', 'drawn', 'out', 'can', 'make', 'otherwise', 'good', 'story', 'seem', 'boring', 'indeed', 'detriment', 'one', 'can', 'start', 'watching', 'series', '13th', 'episode', 'succinctly', 'previous', '12', 'much', 'watching', 'DBZ', 'One', 'can', 'start', 'saga', 'one', 'wishes', 'fully', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'arc', 'he/she', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'knowledgeable', 'back', 'story.Also', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'misled', 'heavy', 'use', 'mecha', 'advertising', 'art', 'mecha', 'battles', 'are', 'minimal', 'personal', 'problems', 'international', 'disputes', 'abound', 'even', 'good', 'dose', 'mysticism', 'well', 'perhaps', 'more', 'one', 'may', 'initially', 'expect', 'Gasaraki', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'story', 'not', 'action', 'much', 'original', 'Gundam', 'series', '1979', 'seminal', 'series', 'Gasaraki', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'many', 'people', 'prefer', 'original', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'English', 'actors', 'presented', 'series', 'perform', 'splendidly', 'do', 'not', 'fail', 'capture', 'emotions', 'lack', 'thereof', 'instances', 'conveyed', 'characters', 'However', 'actor', 'one', 'SSDF', 'captains', 'name', 'annoyingly', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'orangutan', '1980s', 'American', 'cartoon', 'show', 'Shirt', 'Tails', 'voice', 'was', 'completely', 'unbefitting', 'role', 'especially', 'such', 'serious', 'series', 'such', 'this.Despite', 'somewhat', 'harsh', 'criticism', 'found', 'Gasaraki', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'animation', 'far', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'story', 'complex', 'elaborate', 'was', 'had', 'magnetic', 'quality', 'prevented', 'leaving', 'television', 'believe', 'fans', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'should', 'watch', 'series', 'English', 'apprehension', 'due', 'superb', 'job', 'English', 'actors', 'exception', 'orangutan', 'Additionally', 'Gasaraki', 'rather', 'pleasant', 'alternative', 'typical', 'action', 'magic', 'mecha', 'etc', 'anime', 'there', 'most', 'people', 'should', 'enjoy', 'series', 'shrouded', 'mysticism', 'overall', 'militaristic', 'nature', 'stronger', 'hold', 'viewer']",Gasaraki - Perfect Collection

Yes, it met them all the way!Through the series' 22 episodes, we get that 'everything is not as it seems' feeling, which keeps the viewer guessing as to what the outcome of the anime will be. Gasaraki's story is deep in plot, and the use of realistic political threats set in today's world gives you a fresh feeling, compared to other animes where the main characters fight aliens, monsters from outer space, etc.The mecha themselves are realistic in nature, and the theories mentioned in the story will make you believe that one day such machines will be real. But this is where the anime is different from other mecha titles. Only about 40% of the anime has mecha combat, but when it does get to a fight, it's put to good use.The character development is top notch, and is crafted well. The main characters, Yushiro and Miharu are very believable, and you can feel for these characters.I was VERY impressed by the dub cast, as I found very little flaws in them. While you may think that there is a voice or two that could've been better, it's nothing to really complain about, as it's near perfect to the way the characters are. I actually enjoyed the dub more than the sub. As a plus to this, you can enjoy more of the animation and not worry about reading subtitles. But the DVDs come with japanese vocals with subtitles, for those who prefer it that way.This is truly a great series, and shouldn't be missed, whether you're a mecha fan, or a person who likes a great story.

712287,A3F9VH8916IA40,B00006CY42,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[4, 5]","Many have called Gasaraki anNeon Genesis Evangelion: Platinum Collectionrip off, and although I can see some of the reasons why, I could not disagree more. Although both shows have similar looking female leads (Miharu has a striking resemblance to Rei), both deal with mechs, and to some degree philosophy, the overall themes and focuses of the two shows are very different. EVA deals mainly with the human physique, the thoughts and ideas of its characters in order to explore what it is that makes its main character, Shinji, feel so lonely, outcast, and alone. EVA is mainly about the minds and thoughts of its characters with some mech battles thrown into it to make it a little bit exiting.Gasaraki on the other hand is more of a political drama than anything else. Rarely does it dive deep into the minds of its characters, rarely does it explore the human mind in the way EVA does, instead it focuses on the politics of a near future world, the ways nations and major corporations constantly scheme against each other.Although this show isn't a mech series, not in the way EVA or Gundum are, it does give a very realistic version of how mechs, or bie-pedaled weapons, could really be used in actual combat. EVA's mechs weren't practical in any way, and most others I've seen are used merely for the sake of having battles between giant robots, Gasaraki's mechs on the other hand could actually be used by real armies in real life wars. They have strengths and weakness that real weapons systems would have. They are very maneuverable, they can ever buildings, and can run circles around tanks. On the other hand, they are extremely difficult to pilot for long periods of time, and jam in the sand. They aren't invincible fighting machines like the Evangelions are in EVA, there simply a new battle platform, just like a tank or a personnel carrier with its own strengths and weaknesses. The mech battles, for the most part, are very realistic and exiting to watch. If you've ever wanted to see what a real mech in battle would be like, this show is a definite must see.CHARACTERS. This show has a very large cast. From the Gowa family, which has seven members, to the TA team, which has eight members, to the Japanese politicians and illegal immigrants, it's very hard to keep track of everyone. Fortunately none of the characters look alike, so it's not too hard to tell them from one another.The show also has a very great cast of secondary characters, some even better than the main characters. The TA crew is very fun to watch, with LT Sunao AKA munchkin (she's the youngest member) being my personal favorite. None of them get very deep pasts; for that matter neither do any of the main characters, but they do serve their purpose of lightning the mood of what otherwise could be a very dark series and movie the plot forward. Some, Captain Jun for instance, do get some pretty good development, even if it's completely dropped. Some are funny, some are serous, and some are just a little quirky, but they all get their own unique personalities and habits, which makes them all very fun characters to watch.At the same time, however, the main characters, Yushiro Gowa and Miharu, are never really developed, especially Miharu. She's never given a real personality, or any sort of past. I never got a feel for who she really was, what she was thinking, or what her motivations were. In the end she, unfortunately, turned into a carbine copy of Rei from EVA. she was young, a mech pilot, a tool used by ambitious men, had short blue hair, and never did or said much of anything at all. Just as Rei was wasted in EVA, Miharu is wasted in Gasaraki. It's a real shame.One character that was interesting to watch was Misuzu, Yushiro's little sister. All though the beginning part of the series she's the most annoying character I've ever seen (well, one of the most). She had a horrible voice actress, she didn't look her age, and she constantly referred to Yushiro as ""big brother"" instead of by his name, and was always weeping and running around scared. I have siblings and know how they act, but this girl was just too perfect, too innocent and whiny. She talks about dieing for her love, and quotes Hamlet. In the last volume though, her character completely changes from one of wasted potential to one of great interest. I won't ruin the ending, but lest just say she plays a surprising role in the outcome of this series.PLOT. The plot in this series seems to change every two volumes, so there really are three parts.Volumes 1-2 focus mainly on the war in Belgistan. These volumes introduce all the main characters and give us some really interesting battles to watch. As I've already talked about the war, I won't go into further detail.Volumes 3-5. The middle part of the series, and the part I dislike the most, focuses on the two main characters, Yushiro and Miharu, running away from their captures and trying to find out just who exactly they are. These episodes get very mystical and delve a lot into Japanese myth and culture. We get to see a little bit of Japans deep past.Volumes 6-7 bring the series back on track, revolve around a right wing attempt to other throw the Japanese government, and send the US into economic depression. This is, by far, the most exiting part of the series. When the US cuts wheat exports to other nations dew to crops failing, people riot in the streets and the Japanese government is forced to declare marital law. Since the right wing fanatics are in control of the military, they easily take control of the government after this. They then put into motion a plan that will throw the entire world into depression. In response the US sends it own TA's into battle.ENDING. Oh, how the mighty have fallen. I've seen good series become great series because of their endings,Now and Then, Here and There (Complete Collector's Boxed Set)comes to mind, and I've also seen great shows get ruined by their endings like EVA. Although I wouldn't say Gasaraki was ruined, I'd say that the ending brought it down to a 4 star instead of a 5 star rating. This is probably where most people get the idea that this is an EVA rip off, the ending is so much like it. I don't like psycho babble; I want the ideas and meaning to come out in the story, not a monologue at the very end. Fortunately the ending psycho babble only lasts for half of the last episode instead of two whole episodes like EVA's did, but at the same time it isn't as intelligent as EVA's ending (although that ending was very needlessly boring and complicated).  Gasaraki could have been a 5 star ending, but that ending was just unsatisfying. The ending credits save a little face, but just a little.MUSIC. Most anime's have great opening songs but horrendous closers, thinkSerial Experiments Lain - Boxed Set (Signature Series),Cowboy Bebop - The Perfect Sessions (Limited Edition Complete Series Boxed Set), EVA, and just about every other anime series out there. This one is the complete opposite. It has a completely horrible opening song, but a really beautiful closer. The rest of the music for this series isn't really noteworthy; nothing really stands out.BOTTOM LINE. I've only touched the surface of what Gasaraki has to offer. There is so much more to this series that I just wasn't able to get to. this series really has a lot more in common with Ghost in the Shell then it does with EVA, so if you like Ghost than this might be good for you.Replay value; low.",4,not an EVA rip off.,1193961600,"11 2, 2007",2007,7483,"['Many', 'have', 'called', 'Gasaraki', 'anNeon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'Platinum', 'Collectionrip',

They will use a new mech that Yushiro pilots. He is also a Kai. He has the power to summon a god called Gasaraki. The Gowa clan will use these powers to overthrow the government and take control. Yushiro has a secret that he doesn't understand himself, and his brothers aren't talking. He meets a girl named Miharu. Miharu has a strange connection to Yushiro and may hold the key to understanding his purpose.This anime has a very well written story. It's carefully thought out and has lots of suspense and mystery. A lot of people say that it's very complicated. I don't think so. It's very easy to understand if you pay attention. The downfall of this anime is the terrible character development. Even at the final episode, you feel very distant and know next to nothing about the characters. I'll give the story 5 stars, and the characters 1 star. Unfortunately, it takes solid character development and a solid story to make a great anime. Gasaraki only has 1 of those aspects covered. I can't give it any more than 3 stars. I can't recommend Gasaraki to anyone that wants to see an anime with good characters. If you don't care about that and only need a good story to be happy, then you may enjoy this series. Personally, I was very annoyed and forced myself to finish it b/c I had bought the entire set based on good reviews.I have tried to be objective and give good information about this series' strengths and weaknesses.

However, its short of being the brilliant and amazing series that it could have been.The good: Visually, it was beautiful, especially the last volume. Backgrounds and the mecha battle scenes. There were noticeable focuses towards the mecha battles, as in they got a little more detail than a IMPORTANT plot!The basic storyline is still hanging, yet interesting, and the characters have good character development throughout the series. The sounds and music are all averagely appropriate, though there is a noticeable lack of background music during common conversation scenes.The Bad:Even though it is a mecha-centered anime, it's not an ""action-heavy"" series. Much more like the Patlabor movies, it prefers to tend down and go to the plot. Basically I think what happened is they had about thirteen episodes, condensed the plot that they then tried to spread over an entire 26 episode season. With meaningless conversations, mind-numbing ""tutoring"" in the pecific aspects of the machines and events that are occurring, and weak plot catches In the first disk they hint that it takes place 8 years, you would careless...its so boring.

The visuals are excellent for the era it was made, and the minimalistic soundtrack fits it well.The dub is competent, if not stellar, and it's interesting to hear some of ADV's veterans in early roles.As a political thriller, it's done well, with lots of intrigue and sub plots. The ending, however, felt like a deux ex machina to me, with the revealing of the origin of Gasara.",3,Reaches a bit too far in the end.,1215129600,"07 4, 2008",2008,638,"['Gasaraki', 'one', 'shows', 'be', 'either', 'masterpiece', 'total', 'bomb', 'depending', 'who', 'doing', 'reviewing', 'Naturally', ""'m"", 'right', 'middle', 'Gasaraki', 'slow', 'moving', 'first', 'up', 'speed', '13', 'moves', 'well', 'end', 'visuals', 'are', 'excellent', 'era', 'was', 'made', 'minimalistic', 'soundtrack', 'well.The', 'dub', 'competent', 'not', 'stellar', 'interesting', 'hear', 'ADV', 'veterans', 'early', 'roles.As', 'political', 'thriller', 'done', 'well', 'lots', 'intrigue', 'sub', 'plots', 'ending', 'however', 'felt', 'deux', 'ex', 'machina', 'revealing', 'origin', 'Gasara']",Gasaraki - Perfect Collection
