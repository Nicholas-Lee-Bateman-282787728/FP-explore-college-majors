The story is interesting, although the motives and emotions that are driving the two main characters are left in an ambiguous haze. Binoche bugged me,  though; I suppose her character and her performance are meant to be  evocative and mysterious, but I just found her dull and irritating. The sex  scenes struck me as highly pretentious, and the very end of the movie is  inexplicably silly. It's not that the movie doesn't have anything going for  it -- it does.

Sex and violence and chilling suspense build tension of varying angles in the viewer and manage to pull us in even deeper into the story.  With `Damage', I found that that said story had a deep tunnel with which to get lost in and yet sadly it wasn't as embellished as it needed to be.  The fact that many have noted that reading the novel helped them understand the characters more is precisely why this film doesn't work as much as it could have.  You don't really get a sense of these people despite being told in certain ways who they are.I blame Juliette Binoche, but I'll get to that in a minute.`Damage' tells the story of a young troubled woman engaged to a young successful writer whose father is a successful MP.  When the young woman, Anna, meets her betrothed's father there are lustful sparks that ignite and lead into a tumultuous affair that threatens to destroy everything these two possess.  Stephen is clearly in over his head and yet he is thinking of no one but himself and his desires and so he plunges headfirst into a world he isn't familiar with.  Living a life of routine and the expected, this affair offers Stephen something exciting to break up the monotony of his life.  For Anna though, this is about something much darker and ultimately more damaging.For me, the basic premise is strong and holds a lot of potential, and for the most part it makes good on it, but when it comes to Anna and her backstory and the progression of her `damage' I felt like the film lacked the ability to convey it entirely.  This is where Binoche is at fault.  The way she plays Anna is so vacant and almost absent.  I understand that there is a near emotional callousness that can turn up in situations like this, but her eyes are dead.  Even when she is knee deep in her monologue about the big `event' that caused her damage, she is so robotic.  The rest of the cast is fine though, especially Irons who is fantastic at conveying each and every emotional shift Stephen goes through, at times in mere seconds of one another.  What he does with his eyes is the polar opposite of what Binoche fails to do.At the end of the day, this half works.  More than that I guess.  I'd give it a solid B, but it could have been a richly rewarding A had Binoche unearthed more of her character.

27455,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0780605799,Austin Somlo,"[0, 1]","Viewed: 3/08, 4/09Rate: 93/08: Damage is a powerfully made film of a strong feeling and makes for a superb viewing with several glaring flaws. Although it is advertised as an ""erotic thriller,"" Damage is neither erotic nor sexy as Wild Things, but there are side compensations that are quite enjoyable. One of them is the across-the-board terrific acting especially by Jeremy Irons, Miranda Richardson, Rupert Graves (who reminds me a lot of Johnny Depp and is possibly the better actor), and Leslie Caron. I've been harsh on Juliette Binoche in the past for her poor acting skills, but in Damage, she was actually not that bad. I think more could have come out of her, and I am thinking along the lines of 9  Weeks Mickey Rourke's character John. As I've stated before, he possessed the mysterious factor which made the biggest difference in 9  Weeks. When I saw Binoche's character while time had passed during the film, I was disappointed in her not showing off the same effect as John's. That flawed aspect was absolutely crucial to the overall story, and her failure undermined the believability of the tension that was supposed to come with the territory. In short, her character wasn't paradoxical enough. Yet I am impressed with the inclusion of her because of the innocence she brings to the table. That's really an underrated part, and it truly does attract men of power at upper echelons because they have forgotten what it is like to have it again. At the same time, the unfeeling, stoic-like existence that Irons' character puts on a constant force of his life, that's also realistic because of the demands placed on him in order for higher achievement. Maybe I should simply conclude that Louis Malle has a keen eye for detail. Of course, it permeates every scene whether it be cinematography, acting, or the unfolding of the emotions. Meanwhile, a major mistake of the film was adding the (developmentally disabled?) boy midway through. That was...inexplicable and unnecessary. Instead of having the boy on board, why not spend the time focusing on character development of the daughter? Her being too underdeveloped hurt the film further. The best part of the film is obviously the acting, but watching Jeremy Irons doing his part is the treat. He realistically shows how his character is supposed to feel, and I get to see him nailing every single part down right. Another treat is the complete absence of use of flashy camera styles and techniques. What Louis Malle did was put the story straightforward to the audience and let the actors do the magic. In a result, Damage turned out to be a very satisfying picture, relying on the build-up of the tension as time elapsed. In other words, the movie started slow and ended strong. Another aspect I liked about Damage is the story per se. That made the difference between an ordinary tale of adultery and an extraordinary tale of sheer irony twist. I noticed how well the chemistry was between Jeremy Irons and his wife but with him and Juliette Binoche, it was hallow and somewhat unconvincing. I think perhaps more time should have been spent off-camera for them to work on that department, or maybe Binoche was the wrongly cast for the role. But, Damage is definitely light-years better than Wild Orchid and is a cross between 9  Weeks and maybe Fatal Attraction minus the over-the-top moments; I should go further and declare it as a cross between Last Tango in Paris and Death in Venice. In many ways, Damage is almost like watching Ordinary People but in a different vein. What I am impressed about Damage is how well the messages are subtly conveyed. When the events were unfolding, the relationships felt more real and at the same time, the future consequences were becoming real and damaging. Hence the title Damage. In conclusion, putting many films made the past decade to shame, Damage is one of the finest films I've seen although it could and should have been perfect.4/09: Damage still holds up well. What I love the best about the movie is how Louis Malle seems to bring the best out of many elements: plot, performance, fashion, setting, cinematography, high class living, manner, emotion, feeling, and others. There are several things that I am still dismayed about Damage. One is that it is not a sexy movie at all, nowhere a fraction of 9  Weeks. Two is that the chemistry between Jeremy Irons and Juliette Binoche isn't convincing enough. I can see that there is a supposed attraction between the two, but I wished that they worked on it more. Onscreen, it's just not convincing. However, everything else won me over because Damage is a very, very refined picture with great performances. Even better is the story. It is so good that alone was the most compelling factor for my seeing the movie again. The first time I saw Damage, I really liked Miranda Richardson as the wife of the Minister, and now her performance still holds up well. The film came across to me as being too cold and austere, and maybe that was the point of the film. Yet it still bothered me. The daughter is unbelievably and wholly underdeveloped; I just can't believe it. And what is it with the new kid? Still, the situations and the emotions in Damage are perfectly nailed right. I love how Louis Malle finished each scene with the incredible fadeout. The most important question of Damage is: What is the meaning of love? All in all, Damage is an excellent film despite several shortcomings. I have improved the rating of the film from `8' to `9'.",5,Sublime Picture.,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,5511,"['Viewed', '3/08', '4/09Rate', '93/08', 'Damage', 'powerfully', 'made', 'film',

27456,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,0780605799,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[5, 7]","Louis Malle's ""Damage"", based on the Josephine Hart novel, is an uneasy film to watch (the affair between Jeremy Irons and Juliette Binoche is so blatantly doomed that waiting for their inevitable discovery actually overshadows the characterizations and plot), but watch it a second time; the performances are superb!The title has many meanings in this drama; Irons, a British doctor thrust into the political arena by his wife's prominent family, is a melancholy man crushed by aspirations he doesn't share, and a home life that lacks passion (his wife, brilliantly portrayed by Miranda Richardson, focuses her attention on his rise in the government, saving her affections for their son). Binoche has even more emotional baggage; daughter of a much-married globe-trotter (Leslie Caron), she and her brother spend their childhoods shuttled about, and he develops an incestuous love for her; when she rebukes the intimacy he desires, he kills himself, and she deals with her pain through sexual liaisons, hidden behind an outwardly aloof demeanor. When Irons and Binoche meet, a spark ignites, and even her engagement to his son cannot dampen the pair's ardor.As the couple bonds furiously, Irons succumbs to an obsession that literally destroys him, in a tour-de-force performance. His established on-screen persona as a brilliant, manipulating 'user' is dropped, in ""Damage"", and he convincingly portrays a man destroying himself 'for love'; the anguish of his inability to bring the affair to a close is heartbreaking, with his eyes conveying an immeasurable depth of pain.The long-awaited climax is stunning; watch for Richardson's confrontation with Irons...her reactions are both natural, and devastating!The reviewers, in 1993, spent more time discussing the film's graphic sexuality and full-frontal nudity, than in the emotional power of the story.

27457,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,0780605799,Bomojaz,"[6, 10]","A weak and unsatisfying film by the usually excellent Louis Malle. Set in England, a minister in Parliament (played by Jeremy Irons), a cold, unfeeling man, falls in love with his son's fianc? (Juliette Binoche). It's pure passion, though we never get an inkling why she wants his passion. What makes her tick? Is she acting a charade? Is she just crazy? Malle focuses all his attention on Irons, which seems unnecessary since he's so transparent and the easiest to figure out. The two paw and claw at each other, but barely exchange two words. It seems all so vapid. The son (Rupert Graves) catches them making love and, utterly shocked, accidentally falls off a balcony to his death. Irons's career is ruined, of course, and he becomes a hermit, staring at a huge picture of Binoche, Graves, and himself taken together. But what about Binoche?

Jeremy Irons portrays a british government official who becomes obsessed with his son's fiance played by Juliette Binoche. The result is a film that only partially succeeds.I had several problems with the film one being Irons motivation to become involved with this woman in the first place. A look and phone-call and then BAM! OK... but why was he so willing to jump into the dark waters? Power? Lust? Carelessness? Boredom? And herein lies the major weakness of the film. The film deals almost exclusively with the obsesson of Iron's character with Binoche but does not deal with the obsession of the mother (Iron's wife) with her son. Her relationship is clearly destructive and unhealthy but all the damage she inflicts under the guise of her love for her son never finds a voice. No fault falls on the mother when her obsession might well explain both the son's and father's weaknesses. At one part the son is talking about his family life saying that although it was good it lacked passion. His mother then replies that it is probably her fault and he replies that he rather thinks it's his father's. It's a careless and misdirecting remark and a sadly missed plot point.As you may expect there are many sex scenes. I don't know what I was expecting but many made me laugh. They seemed so ridiculous and absurdly physical. I rather think Binoche must have suffered some bruising as a result of Iron's flailing.While this film is meant to portray the damage that a traditional obsession (i.e. an affair) can have, it also begs to be seen from the the alternate perspective of a mother's obsession for her son.

27464,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0780605799,Dennis Littrell,"[8, 10]","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)[BEWARE SPOILERS]I don't know whether I've ever watched a film in which I identified more with all the characters than I did in this emotionally wrenching masterwork from the late, great Louis Malle.  It is part of the genius of Malle to, like Shakespeare, make every character real and to see and present the depth of even those slightly off stage.I could begin with the youngest, the daughter Sally (Gemma Clarke) who says little and is always at a slight distance, her serious face in the backseat of the car seemingly thinking dark thoughts, her face down the hallway at night, seemingly knowing that her father has committed adultery with her brother's fianc&eacute;e--yet not knowing.  Louis Malle wanted a certain expression on her face; he wanted the primeval depth of her character as a being that knows more than it knows to be etched upon the screen.  And this is because what she knows and doesn't know is what we all know and don't tell ourselves, namely that there is a part of our nature that is not under our control, a part of our nature that can cause not just damage, but disaster.  And we are helpless to even see it coming let alone stop it.In the wife, played with precision and finesse by Miranda Richardson, we see a complex and open person who expresses herself with subtle incisiveness in little gestures and poignant pauses, but then when it all comes crashing down, she speaks with the power of cold steel cutting into flesh.Juliette Binoche's enigmatic Anna pulled me in the way she easily vacuumed in Jeremy Irons' high toned minister, Stephen Fleming.  She was a low pressure area of enormous force that sucked Stephen to her like some bit of fluff and made him demand incredulously ""Who are you?"" while realizing that until now he never knew himself and what he could feel.  For those who are more familiar with the Juliette Binoche of, say, The English Patient (1996) or Cache (2005), the pure sexual power that she can radiate on the screen may surprise you.  Here her power is in what seems like pure surrender.  But it is Stephen Fleming who is surrendering.Anna's mother, played with a nuanced directness by Leslie Caron, is one of those women who say whatever is on her mind regardless of the circumstances, often to the great embarrassment of everyone present.  Yet at the end we see in her an instinctive wisdom that in retrospect makes it right that she should speak so candidly and without guile.  If only Stephen had listened to her!  If only he had understood that what she said was to be taken literally and as a grave warning.  Of course in such matters, warnings are of no avail.Louis Malle remarked in the interview that is on the DVD that Jeremy Irons felt that his character had to be played in some sense ""as himself.""  He would be not only naked to the audience in a physical sense (he was; beware prudes) but also as an emotional human being.  He needed to project the fall from all that is proper and circumspect to become someone who would grovel before a passion he did not know existed within himself.  He had to go from high dignity to abject humility.  Anna was the siren's call and he her chosen sailor.  He could not resist even though his passion for her would destroy everything he had, his career, his wife and family, his reputation, his personal homeostasis.  He would think that, yes, I must leave my wife and go with Anna, and she would have to tell him that you can't do that, your son would hate you.And then there is Anna's passion, not just in the physical, but in the deeply emotion sense of the irrational when she says ""Do you think I would consent to marry Martyn if I could not have you?""  As we see it is only the wife who knows and expresses, after it is all over, the obvious truth: ""Did you think you could go on like this every day into the future?""Well, when you think about it, of course not.  Yet neither Anna nor Stephen, both blinded by the wild passion they felt for each other, knew the terrible state of danger they were creating.  Anna's sin is that of arrogance to think she could satisfy both the father and the son and could manipulate them like toys on a string and nobody would be the wiser.  And Stephen's failing is really that of a child-like surrender to this flood of emotion and passion that Anna evoked in him.  He, even more than she, is irrational and blind.Did she love him?  Did he love her?  And what is love? it might be asked.  Long ago I once said to a young woman, ""I love you,"" and she said what Anna says to Stephen, ""I know.""  Such an answer should be an eye opener, but neither I nor Stephen noticed at the time.Seldom have I felt so much emotion while watching a film.  I have seen most of Malle's work, and he is always personal and deeply involved with his characters; but I think here he has created, if not a masterpiece, at least a most compelling story of what it is to be human and to fall from grace.  I think it is only right that it took a combination of human error (the key left in the lock by Stephen) and the callous hand of fate that sends Martyn over the railing to bring about his modern tragedy.  And, as in all great works of tragic art, the seeds of destruction are there in the psyches of the characters like the heel of Achilles.Here's a quote from Anna that foreshadows the ending: ""Damaged people are dangerous because they know they can survive.""",5,"Emotionally captivating with brilliant performances by Irons, Binoche and Richardson",1213660800,"06 17, 2008",2008,5541,"['Note', '500',

But I still love that look]; or Fatal Attraction at the morning meeting they have when his wife leaves town), though that of the characters in THIS film have topped anything I have ever seen. Never seen two movie characters look at each other for that long, with that much sexual tension, wordlessly. And again, esp. with Irons, it's all in the eyes. THAT is one amazing actor.Also, I've never seen two not-conventionally-attractive people make forbidden sex so sexy.  Jeremy Irons and Juliette Binoche...I don't think anyone else could have played these parts.  It's a testament to their acting (they are both Oscar winners...though not for this film) that this is such a great movie, in my opinion (I gave it four stars, not five, because I just rarely give anything five stars...when I do, you know it's off the charts!). They acted SO MUCH with their eyes. It really is something to behold.I disagree with anyone who poo-poos the sex scenes, which get more...naked as the movies progresses. I think they are NOT sleazy.  They are sometimes urgent and sometimes sensual and sometimes literally fumbling with desire. The urgency, the wordlessness, the we-must-do-it NOW, the tension when they are with the family (she is engaged to his son, for those who don't know)...it's brilliantly done, and again, that has everything to do with the actors.  He's old and a little haggard and she's a little bit butchy when dressed, but the scenes are are HOT and well executed.  They are risking everything (and yes, there's a train wreck coming, of course) and that's hot, too.  They know it, and they just can't stop it.  He tries to but she rents them an apartment and they are back at it again.  She wants to have the best of both worlds (marriage to Martyn, and hot sex with his father), Irons wants to leave his wife (or thinks he does) but Binoche makes a great point: What would you gain? You'd have what you have right now, plus a broken marriage. And do you REALLY want to have breakfast and read the paper with me every morning?Louis Malle (late husband of Candice Bergen, of all people!) is obviously a brilliant director.

Fleming is a leading Conservative MP, likely to take over a Cabinet post as minister of health in the next re-shuffle. I feel the author, Josephine Hart, decided to give him that job, in order to maximise the fall that confronted him when his errors are discovered. It was as senior an establishment role that the protagonist could have without fearing he would be recognised at every street corner. Politics don't play a large part in the story, but the film will have played some small part in the image of sleaze that the Conservative party acquired in the early 1990s.Binoche is utterly beautiful, and totally passive during the sex scenes, but her accent (cleverly excused by scriptwriter Hare as the result of her travelling the world) is all over the place. Irons is convincing in the role, and Miranda Richardson puts in another perfect performance.

27473,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,0780605799,Hikari,"[5, 6]","Louis Malle's ""Damage"" is not the movie that launched Jeremy Iron's career as our reigning upper-crust sex pervert.  That would be David Cronenberg's ""Dead Ringers"" shot 5 years before this film.  Mr. Irons would follow this performance with turns in ""M. Butterfly"" and ""Lolita"", cementing his reputation as the actor most willing to go to the dark side of sexual perversion, a journey his characters never return from in one piece, if they survive at all.  When I read Josephine Hart's 1991 novel of the same name, I wondered idly who could possibly play the leads and seeing Irons here, his casting is a no-brainer.  There are very few actors who can pull off the tricky combination of aristocratic breeding and sexual depravity, but this is Irons' stock-in-trade.When we first meet Dr. Stephen Fleming, he is a respected, high-ranking member of Parliament, with a lovely home complete with servants and an equally handsome family.  Apart from feeling inferior to his father-in-law, who is the real source of the family affluence, Stephen's life seems about perfect in every conceivable way, his political star destined to rise even higher.  But Stephen's a restless man; despite all his successes, he's wrestling with a mid-life crisis, at loose ends in a career that his ambitious wife wanted for him more than he wanted it himself.  He is ripe for a Perfect Storm.Enter the storm in the form of Anna, the dark and mysterious beauty who introduces herself to Stephen at a cocktail party.  The two exchange an immediate frisson of carnal recognition, and Stephen is lost.  The supremely inconvenient fact that Anna is dating and soon to be engaged to Stephen's son do not stop this pair from embarking on a torrid, wildly inappropriate, ultimately tragic sexual affair.  Anna is damaged, she tells her new lover, and therefore dangerous.  The 'damage' stems from the adolescent loss of her brother, in whose death Anna was either directly or indirectly complicit--that is for the audience to judge.  Anna is not engaging in false advertising here, but her besotted lover does not heed what she says and stay away from her, to the detriment of everyone his life touches.As Anna, Juliette Binoche has the more difficult, more unsympathetic role.  Anna is an enigma, and enigmas are more easily explained on the page than onscreen, where a reader can get into a character's head.  Binoche's Anna does a lot of unsettling stone-faced staring meant to be mesmerising, I guess, but despite her austere beauty which captures Hart's physical descripton of Anna closely enough, something vital has been lost in translation.  Binoche's Anna lacks the force of any sort of vitality or spirit; for Malle it is enough that she just look beautiful and tortured.  Binoche is very attractive indeed, but in the end, her face alone (and her propensity for wearing black stockings) is not sufficient explanation for all that transpires here.  Is Anna a completely amoral self-serving Jezebel out to dismantle a happy family and betray all sorts of trust just because she can, being so irresistible, or does the greater share of blame fall on the men who singlemindedly (or using a lesser head) pursue the forbidden fruit she seems to offer?  Whichever you believe, the book offers a more substantial portrait of a complicated woman than the one Binoche offers here.This is essentially a two-actor showcase, and just about every inch of both actors is on display, particularly Irons.  Some of the love scenes are unintentially hilarious; if I'm not wrong, Binoche and Irons may have actually invented several new lovemaking positions, none of them elegant to watch.  Miranda Richardson as the wronged wife and Rupert Graves as the wronged son/fiance bring memorable poignancy as the collateral damage in this doomed affair.

The film is not pleasing to those who want to see more ""character development"" for the same reason ""Bridges of Madison County"" was panned - the point of the movie was not who the characters were and why they became who they became.  The point was, two similar spirits met, mingled and, for the moment, loosed themselves from artificial restraint.  The relationship between the two main characters in this film had no chance of developing into anything beyond lust and rutting for the satisfaction of that lust.  The ""Damage"" occurs because the lusty rutting offends so many fundamental mores.  As the situation between the two ""lovers"" develops it becomes less and less human until it finally is beyond any control - the lust becomes an addiction as destructive as the worst kind of drug addiction.  It doesn't simply ""spin"" out of control - the destructive energy builds until it cannot be contained.  The energy is such that it sucks its other, unaware to that point, victims into its vortex and they all are devoured - the damage is total destruction of life as it had been only a short time before.The film should prompt thoughts about the ""artificial"" restraints on ""normal"" urges and instincts.  What's wrong with two people being physically attracted and doing the things these people do? What's wrong with the same kinds of people who rolled together on the kitchen floor in ""Bridges of Madison County?""  Does ""love"" require fidelity?  Should we not - as humans - be at all concerned about the emotional damage we can cause to ourselves and those we love by not restraining a natural urge?This movie is a train wreck from the opening scene.  It's something you might want to look away from - but just can't.  It might disgust you but it also might thrill you.  It's the reason people listen to shock radio and watch soap operas.  It's the reason people say our society has gone or is going to hell.  It's our base nature that we like to think we don't have or, at least, have under control.  It's what happens when - if - we ignore our humanity and give head to our basest instincts.When you watch it, don't just watch it.  Let yourself go.  And then, at the end, wonder if it was a dream you'd enjoy as a reality or if you are relieved it was just a dream.

27478,A1W62UQWNZMM55,0780605799,"""infinitemovies""","[5, 9]","Initially when this movie came out critics and audiences were both divided by this movie. 50% liked it, the other 50% did not and for one reason which Entertainement Weekly pointed out: some people did not buy the obsession that Jeremy Irons character had for Juliette Binoche's character. So in order to enjoy this movie you have to disregard the fact whether this is realistic or not. In my opinion this is not something that does not happen in real life. There are many people who are obsessed over other people. And in the past people have accepted other tales of obsession (VERTIGO, OBSESSION) so i don't see why they can't accept this one. The movie which is directed by french director Louis Malle is about a middle aged man (Jeremy Irons- DEAD RINGERS, 1988, LOLITA,1997) who carries on a secret affair with his son's mysterious fiancee Anna (Juliette Binoche- CHOCOLAT,2000, THE WIDOW OF ST. PIERRE, 2001). Their relationship has nothing to do with love. It's merely an outlet for both of them to unleash their fellings and sexual desires. The sex scenes are fairly erotic and tastefully done but they also give you a chance to see what is going on inside these two poeple since they express themselves through sex. It's a predictable story but it's still interesting to see how bad things are going to end up. The movie is above all a story of obsession and how it drives people to do things they never thought they would do. It's easy to figure out why Jeremy Irons' character is carrying on this affair but you have to pay close attention to find out why Juliette Binoche's character does too and for some it may be hard to swallow. Both the leads handle their roles very well and the movie is directed very well and more subtle than one would think and the script is good enough. But the standout is Miranda Richardson as the wife of Jeremy Irons, a role for which she was nomintated for the academy award for best supporting actress though i think she deserved the nomination more for THE CRYING GAME. The script should have been a little better but considering how bad people claim the book is i commend the makers of this movie for making it better.",4,Another interesting  tale of obsession,995241600,"07 16, 2001",2001,2165,"['Initially', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'critics', 'audiences', 'were', 'divided', 'movie', '50', '%', 'liked', 'other', '50', '%', 'did', 'not', 'one', 'reason', 'Entertainement', 'Weekly', 'pointed', 'out', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'buy', 'obsession', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'character', 'had', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'character', 'So', 'order', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'have', 'disregard', 'fact', 'realistic', 'not', 'opinion', 'not', 'something', 'not', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'obsessed', 'other', 'people', 'past', 'people', 'have', 'accepted', 'other', 'tales', 'obsession', 'VERTIGO', 'OBSESSION', 'so', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'one', 'movie', 'directed', 'french', 'director', 'Louis', 'Malle', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'Jeremy', 'Irons-', 'DEAD', 'RINGERS', '1988', 'LOLITA,1997', 'who', 'secret', 'affair', 'son', 'mysterious', 'fiancee', 'Anna', 'Juliette', 'Binoche-', 'CHOCOLAT,2000', 'THE', 'WIDOW', 'OF', 'ST.', 'PIERRE', '2001', 'relationship', 'nothing', 'do', 'love', 'merely', 'outlet', 'unleash', 'fellings', 'sexual', 'desires', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'fairly', 'erotic', 'tastefully', 'done', 'also', 'give', 'chance', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'two', 'poeple', 'express', 'sex', 'predictable', 'story', 'still', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'bad', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'movie', 'story', 'obsession', 'how', 'people', 'do', 'things', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'do', 'easy', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'character', 'carrying', 'affair', 'have', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'character', 'too', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'swallow', 'leads', 'handle', 'roles', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'directed', 'very', 'well', 'more', 'subtle', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'script', 'good', 'enough', 'standout', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'wife', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'role', 'was', 'nomintated', 'academy', 'award', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'i', 'think', 'deserved', 'nomination', 'more', 'THE', 'CRYING', 'GAME', 'script', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'better', 'considering', 'how', 'bad', 'people', 'claim', 'book', 'i', 'commend', 'makers', 'movie', 'making', 'better']",N/A
27479,A20CR4907G7CTS,0780605799,Jeff Marzano,"[4, 6]","This is a great movie about obsession, choices, and the consequences of those choices.  It shows perhaps how the unfathomable hand of fate is always working mysteriously in the background to allow people to make the choices they really want.For me there are some key turning points in the story:1) Stephen's fateful meeting with Anna who always dresses in black and has been surrounded by sadness for her enire life apparently.2) Anna's decision not to marry Stephen.  Although she has a point that if they did get married perhaps Stephen would then get bored and maybe find someone else to have a clandestine affair with.3) Anna's mother's warning to Stephen to let Anna go.4) Anna's decision to get a second apartment and give Stephen the key.  That was the point where they both made the decision to do the wrong thing in secret.Anna has an almost hypnotic effect on all three members of Stephen's family including Stephen himself, his son, and even the grandfather has his eye on her.  Maybe a good sequel for this movie would be to have Anna get involved with the grandfather.There is some strange attraction between Stephen and the dark Anna.  I don't know if this is implying that they have had past life experiences, they are twin souls, or something else.  Perhaps reading the book would help.This is an educational movie to watch I feel.  It shows how the choices people make can often have unexpected and damaging consequences when they don't place any restrictions on their emotions.Like many great movies the story gets philosophical at the end especially with what Ingrid says.After the damage was done it appeared to me that Stephen felt little or no remorse.  Rather he seemed to realize that this is what he had chosen and what he really wanted.Originally he had a wonderful wife, two kids, money, and success.  But he also had responsibilities.At the end he was alone but had little responsibilities.The dvd contains the 'R' and unrated versions.

Both of them act in ways that are inconceivable betrayals of people who they profess to love.  Irons' character betrays his wife and his son and his family.  Binoche betrays Irons' son and destroys Irons' marriage.  Irons' son dies as a direct result of his discovery of his father and Binoche's tandem betrayal of him.""Damage"" tries to suggest that ""good"" people can be swept away by some primal attraction and destroy everything they should care about in order to fulfill (or should I say ""sate"") it.  I'm skeptical.  People commit acts of infidelity, but I don't think they rise very often to the symphonic levels in ""Damage.""  I'm left thinking either that Irons and Binoche's characters were both mentally ill and tragically ""found"" each other or as the title of my review implies, despite protests to the contrary, they didn't really care about the people in their lives who they should have cared about.As far as the technical details go, the movie is alright.  Binoche gives a better performance than Irons.  The movie manages to be lurid without being particularly sexy.

27491,AGQY11NLQJ2JL,0780605799,Medusa,"[0, 1]","Every time I watch a movie that is based on a book, I can't help but thinking that it just can't be fair to the book itself. There will always be a way or another to minimize either the story or the characters. Based on the book by Josephine Hart, this movie is actually enhancing the book in so many ways.I saw the movie 14 years ago, when it was heavily criticized for the sexual scenes, the nudity, and the lack of dialogue. I loved it then and I come to love it even more now.In the book, the focus was on the emotional struggle that the main male character (Stephen Fleming) was going through. He lived all of his life being the good family man, good provider, simply playing it safe by the rules, until he meets Anna, the mysterious girl friend of his son. That's when he looses control and gets torn apart between his strong desire to have that woman and his sincere love to his kids.Anna would strike you as the cold, mysterious, kind of evil person who might have some emotional side to her, but it's focused on her selfishness and total consumption into her own emotional damage.Now, when Jeremy Irons is playing Stephen, and Juliette Binoche is playing Anna, the story was taken to a different level, where dialogue is not needed much to show the development of the characters.Binoche with the short hair cut, innocent yet very pretty face, and piercing looks is definitely making Anna the irresistible, mysterious, semi evil woman.Irons simply can show with his eyes the entire struggle and pain that Stephen is going through; I don't think any other actor could've played that role.The sexual scenes were way deeper than mere sexual attraction. I don't understand why they were criticized that much over the years, while the porn industry was blooming. The love scenes mostly focused on the two actors' faces and didn't show much skin as critics would say. The love making didn't focus on sex as much as on the desire of that man to bosses that woman in every way, and on the total physical submission she gave him, while at the same time she didn't give him her whole self.I don't want to ruin the plot for any body who's interested in watching the movie, but try to focus on Irons' facial expressions, on the scene after the public love making in France where he goes back to his room and lays crying on the bed, on the scene when he's naked holding his son, and on the final scene and its details(""...she was no different than any body else"").With two great actors like Irons and Binoche, you might be distracted from the other great actors like Martin (the son), Ingrid (the wife). Great movie, great music, great director BUT if you are a righteous person you might not like it; if you are a religious righteous person you will hate it (it might put you in confrontation with some puzzles about life and human limitations, that I highly doubt righteous people will understand).",5,"deep, shocking.....",1211932800,"05 28, 2008",2008,2895,"['time', 'watch', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'fair', 'book', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'way', 'minimize', 'story', 'characters', 'Based', 'book', 'Josephine', 'Hart', 'movie', 'actually', 'enhancing', 'book', 'so', 'many', 'ways.I', 'saw', 'movie', '14', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'heavily', 'criticized', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'nudity', 'lack', 'dialogue', 'loved', 'then', 'come', 'love', 'even', 'more', 'now.In', 'book', 'focus', 'was', 'emotional', 'struggle', 'main', 'male', 'character', 'Stephen', 'Fleming', 'was', 'going', 'lived', 'life', 'being', 'good', 'family', 'man', 'good', 'provider', 'simply', 'playing', 'safe', 'rules', 'Anna', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'friend', 'son', 'when', 'control', 'torn', 'apart', 'strong', 'desire', 'have', 'woman', 'sincere', 'love', 'kids.Anna', 'would', 'strike', 'cold', 'mysterious', 'kind', 'evil', 'person', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'emotional', 'side', 'focused', 'selfishness', 'total', 'consumption', 'own', 'emotional', 'damage.Now', 'when', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'playing', 'Stephen', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'playing', 'Anna', 'story', 'was', 'taken', 'different', 'level', 'where', 'dialogue', 'not', 'needed', 'much', 'show', 'development', 'characters.Binoche', 'short', 'hair', 'cut', 'innocent', 'yet', 'very', 'pretty', 'face', 'piercing', 'looks', 'definitely', 'making', 'Anna', 'irresistible', 'mysterious', 'semi', 'evil', 'woman.Irons', 'simply', 'can', 'show', 'eyes', 'entire', 'struggle', 'pain', 'Stephen', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'actor', 'could', ""'ve"", 'played', 'role.The', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'were', 'way', 'deeper', 'mere', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'were', 'criticized', 'that', 'much', 'years', 'porn', 'industry', 'was', 'blooming', 'love', 'mostly', 'focused', 'two', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'much', 'skin', 'critics', 'would', 'say', 'love', 'making', 'did', ""n't"", 'focus', 'sex', 'as', 'much', 'desire', 'man', 'bosses', 'woman', 'way', 'total', 'physical', 'submission', 'gave', 'same', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'whole', 'self.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'plot', 'body', 'who', 'interested', 'watching', 'movie', 'try', 'focus', 'Irons', 'facial', 'expressions', 'scene', 'public', 'love', 'making', 'France', 'where', 'back', 'room', 'crying', 'bed', 'scene', 'when', 'naked', 'holding', 'son', 'final', 'scene', 'details', 'was', 'different', 'body', 'else', '.With', 'two', 'great', 'actors', 'Irons', 'Binoche', 'might', 'be', 'distracted', 'other', 'great', 'actors', 'Martin', 'son', 'Ingrid', 'wife', 'Great', 'movie', 'great', 'music', 'great', 'director', 'BUT', 'are', 'righteous', 'person', 'might', 'not', 'are', 'religious', 'righteous', 'person', 'will', 'hate', 'might', 'put', 'confrontation', 'puzzles', 'life', 'human', 'limitations', 'highly', 'doubt', 'righteous', 'people', 'will', 'understand']",N/A

Her character apparently wants to relive her sick past and what better way to do it than to seek out her fiance's father and involve him?  However, everything about Binoche irritated me, from her inexpressive face to her masculine appearance and piano legs dressed in black hose to the sex scenes where she flops around like a rag doll.

On the other hand, if she was aiming for pathetic, pitiable slave to uncontrollable desire, she missed it by a mile. I found her performance in Damage more chilling then Glenn Close's scorned mistress in ""Fatal Attraction"" , and very gripping, if more than a little uneven.Jeremy Irons has the uncanny ability to turn in a thrilling performance capable of rising above the worst scripts (House of the Spirits) or casting disasters (Man in the Iron Mask, starring Leo DeCaprio). His character was so enthralling that I couldn't help but be drawn into a movie I would otherwise never have bothered with.Rupert Graves' (The Last King, Forsyte Saga, Room With a View)  talents as Anna's fiancee are exremely underutilized in this completely undeveloped character, which was a disappointment.I agree with other viewers comments that some of the sex scenes were a little off. I am reminded of one bizarre scene in particular where it seems improbable that the actors were even close enough to be making any meaningful physical contact whatsoever, despite suggestions to the contrary as ecstatically reflected in Anna's eyes..unless, of course, the character of Stephen happens to possess substantial hidden assets the audience is not privy to.In at least one emotional scene, particularly after Stephen drops in on Anna to find her lounging about with her mysterious ex-lover Peter, the accompanying bouncy musical score is so distractingly incongrous with the plot that you wonder if the director meant for you to interpret the movie as a comedy after all.Miranda Richardson as Jeremy Iron's wife has one killer scene after the ""Damage"" is finally done towards the end but is otherwise forgettable.One of the most implausible scenes in the entire movie involves Anna's mother, who, in making small talk with her daughter's future in laws over dinner, casually mentions the fact that her future son-in-law bears an undeniably strong resemblance to Anna's long dead brother (dessert anyone? or have we all lost our appetites by now- especially for Anna?).  Clueless as she appears to be with regard to her own incredible lack of social skills, she somehow knows with absolute certainty that her daughter's future father-in-law and Anna have already enjoyed the forbidden fruits of their seedy lust for each other. Okay. Sure.I found this movie incredibly entertaining in spite of all the minor problems.

I have talked with a few people who rented the film because they were fans of Jeremy Irons but were upset by the premise of the movie. So, as I said, if you are easily offended, skip _Damage_.Stephen Fleming (Jeremy Irons) is a prominent MP with a career that continues to blossom. He is married to an attractive, blueblood wife and has two healthy children. His son, Martyn (Rupert Graves), is doing well for himself: he has met a new girlfriend and has been promoted to an important position as political writer for a newspaper. Stephen and Anna (Juliette Binoche) meet at a party or get-together of some sort and discover an instant attraction. Stephen finds out shortly thereafter that Anna is Martyn's girlfriend. Within days, a steamy, destructive sexual relationship begins between Anna and Stephen. It continues, growing increasingly passionate, obsessive and harmful. In an odd (even wacky) twist of fate, their affair is discovered. Anna flees in her usual pattern and Stephen must return to his wife, Ingrid (Miranda Richardson), to see if he can possibly salvage his marriage.Aside from the plot being centered around a man cheating on his wife with his son's girlfriend, the intense sex scenes in the film will likely turn some people off. I have seen both the R-rated and the Unrated version of the film and I cannot tell any difference between them so whichever one you choose, you are sure to see plenty of skin. After I watched the film, I read the novel by Josephine Hart and felt that I understood the characters much better. Although Stephen does inspire some feelings of repulsion from me, I do feel sympathy for him. He has lived a life of routine and boredom. As Louis Malle discusses in the ""One on One"" feature found on this DVD, the family life Stephen has experienced is one built on habit, not on strong emotions. When Anna comes along, something snaps. All of the emotions that Stephen has bottled up come rushing out like a floodgate that has burst.

His hands remain in his pockets. His jacket remains on. He is disengaged and bored by his surroundings.Then Anna Barton, played by an illuminous Juliette Binoche enters the picture. Anna is the girlfriend of Stephen's son Martyn. Anna and Stephen enter a sexual affair without exchanging more than two sentences. Anna and Stephen's first sex scene is telling...Anna lays on a bed with her arms horizontal, like she is laying down on a crucifix. Their love affair is as destructive in the bedroom as it is in real life. Stephen tears at Anna's clothing, digging into her, pleading ""Who are you""? The only time Anna laughs is when Stephen is tearing at her, unable to control himself.Anna is ""damaged"" by her past-her brother committed suicide when Anna came of age sexually. Like a rape victim may need to relive her trauma within the safe confines of another relationship, Anna needs to be immersed in the incestual sexual bonds of her past, so she engages her father in law sexually. The ""damaged"" side of Anna is desperate for the twisted affair with Stephen. But the normal side of Anna needs a life with Martyn.Stephen tries to turn his affair with Anna into love. Stephen attempts to put their relationship on a straightforward course-he suggests he break up with his wife and start a life with Anna. Anna asks why? Why give up your life for something you already have? Then Stephen tries to break off with Anna and Anna responds by giving him a key to a love nest telling Stephen ""Do you think I would have married Martyn if I couldn't have you too?"" Anna can not love without engaging her dark and light sides and she tries to align the Fleming family to her personality with disastarous results.A brilliant film, one of my favourites. Whereas erotic scenes in movies like9 1/2 Weeksseem almost contrived so that the director could get an arty looking shot, the sex scenes in Damage are primal. Some may be put off by such intense emotion. I loved it.French cinephiles will probably find the themes in this film familar and unoffensive. The French seem to inherently understand the need for passion and marriage, even if the two aren't shared with the same person. Not coincidentally, Anna is 1/2 French. If you analyzed this film from a cultural perspective, you'd could probably attribute Anna's problems to the struggle between her French and English heritage.The book by Josephine Hart which spawned this filmDamageis as good as the movie.

27514,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,0780605799,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","Watching ""Damage"" was like watching a train wreck - it was one of those movies where I really could not care much for the main characters, i.e. Jeremy Irons and Juliette Binoche, yet I could not help watching it till the bitter end. What lifted this movie above a torrid treatise on forbidden passion and damaged individuals was the superior acting by Juliette Binoche and Jeremy Irons in that order (and Miranda Richardson deserves praise too as the wife of Iron's character).Jeremy Irons plays Stephen Fleming, a respected Member of Parliament with a lovely wife and three children. Life appears to be perfect until Fleming makes the fatal mistake of falling in lust with his son Martin's (Rupert Graves)girlfriend, beautiful Anna Barton (Juliette Binoche). Fleming goes on to have torrid sex with Barton, who reciprocates and even encourages his advances. The pair continue their affair even as Irons struggles with his duplicity, especially with regards to his wife and son, and matters get even worse when Martin announces his engagement to Anna. Will Fleming save himself before it is too late or is he doomed?Binoche delivers a compelling performance as a woman so damaged by some trauma in her past that she is nothing but a shallow vessel, who finds wanton sex to be a means of assuaging the emptiness within. I was repulsed by her character, yet at the same time found myself trying to justify her actions, such is the complexity of her character. Irons strikes the right chord in his portrayal of a stuffy politician whose normal life falls apart as he gives in to his lust and loses all semblance of self-control, even at the expense of his relationship with his son and wife. Miranda Richardson was credible as the wronged wife who is mainly clueless, though her character does take an instant dislike to Anna. Graves does not impress with his performance (a pity for I liked some of his other roles, e.g. inA Room With a View (Two-Disc Special Edition)) as Fleming's son.The lead characters do not elicit sympathy - they know that what they are doing is despicable and wrong, yet are unwilling to put a stop to the affair. Yet in spite of the moral flaws in these two characters, the story works because of the strong performances by the cast, especially Binoche, who even in the wildest throes of passion, haunts the viewer with the emptiness in her eyes.",4,Compelling acting and assured direction,1282521600,"08 23, 2010",2010,2370,"['Watching', 'Damage', 'was', 'watching', 'train', 'wreck', 'was', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'really', 'could', 'not', 'care', 'much', 'main', 'characters', 'i.e', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'yet', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'watching', 'bitter', 'end', 'What', 'lifted', 'movie', 'torrid', 'treatise', 'forbidden', 'passion', 'damaged', 'individuals', 'was', 'superior', 'acting', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'order', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'praise', 'too', 'wife', 'Iron', 'character', '.Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Stephen', 'Fleming', 'respected', 'Member', 'Parliament', 'lovely', 'wife', 'three', 'children', 'Life', 'be', 'perfect', 'Fleming', 'fatal', 'mistake', 'falling', 'lust', 'son', 'Martin', 'Rupert', 'Graves', 'girlfriend', 'beautiful', 'Anna', 'Barton', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'Fleming', 'have', 'torrid', 'sex', 'Barton', 'who', 'even', 'advances', 'pair', 'continue', 'affair', 'even', 'Irons', 'struggles', 'duplicity', 'especially', 'regards', 'wife', 'son', 'matters', 'get', 'even', 'worse', 'when', 'Martin', 'engagement', 'Anna', 'Will', 'Fleming', 'save', 'too', 'late', 'doomed', 'Binoche', 'compelling', 'performance', 'woman', 'so', 'damaged', 'trauma', 'past', 'nothing', 'shallow', 'vessel', 'who', 'wanton', 'sex', 'be', 'means', 'assuaging', 'emptiness', 'was', 'repulsed', 'character', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'found', 'trying', 'justify', 'actions', 'such', 'complexity', 'character', 'Irons', 'strikes', 'right', 'chord', 'portrayal', 'stuffy', 'politician', 'normal', 'life', 'apart', 'lust', 'semblance', 'self-control', 'even', 'expense', 'relationship', 'son', 'wife', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'was', 'credible', 'wronged', 'wife', 'who', 'mainly', 'clueless', 'character', 'take', 'instant', 'dislike', 'Anna', 'not', 'impress', 'performance', 'pity', 'liked', 'other', 'roles', 'e.g', 'inA', 'Room', 'View', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Fleming', 'son.The', 'lead', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'elicit', 'sympathy', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'despicable', 'wrong', 'yet', 'are', 'unwilling', 'put', 'stop', 'affair', 'spite', 'moral', 'flaws', 'two', 'characters', 'story', 'strong', 'performances', 'cast', 'especially', 'Binoche', 'who', 'even', 'wildest', 'throes', 'passion', 'viewer', 'emptiness', 'eyes']",N/A
