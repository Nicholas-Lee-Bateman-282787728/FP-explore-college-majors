Burt Lancaster plays the headmaster of an institution for metally chalancged children, and pulls of a grade A performance. Judy Garland plays, in one of the best, and the last, straight dramatic role of her life, music teacher Miss Henson, who as soon as she arrives becomes very concerned with a young student/patent, Ruben.Miss Henson is troubled that no one, not even his own parents ever visit Ruben, and sets out on a quest to get them to do so.  In the process Ruben becomes very attached to Miss Henson, and wants to be with her, even when he should be out playing, he'd rather be with her.Ruben's parents never come to visit him, becouse they can not bear having a child that is not normal. That is what is so heart breaking, this child did not ask to be mentally challenged, it just occured.This is the story of a little boy, just longing for love, but being denied it from his parents just becouse he is different. So he accepts love and attention fom the first person to want to give it, Miss Henson.A truely touching film.

276438,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6301965876,Dr. James Gardner,"[1, 1]","""A Child is Waiting"" is a 1963 black and white well-meaning attempt to portray the care and treatment of the developmentally disabled (then called mentally retarded and/or mentally handicapped). It was no doubt triggered by the 1960 election of JFK who had a sister who was mentally retarded and institutionalized. The film was written by Abby Mann (1927-2008) whose most famous work was ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" (1961). In accepting the Oscar for that film Mann commented - ""A writer worth his salt at all has an obligation not only to entertain but to comment on the world in which he lives""For this film Mann brought some of his Nuremberg team on board - Stanley Kramer as producer, and Burt Lancaster and Judy Garland as actors. The film centers on the dispute between Lancaster and Garland over the type of treatment for one of the children, and also on the need for parental involvement.Burt Lancaster (1913-94) plays a Psychologist administrator of a state residential facility for developmentally disabled children. Lancaster was nominated for an Oscar for ""From Here to Eternity"" (1953) and would be nominated 3 more times and win for ""Elmer Gantry"" (1960). He was nominated for a Golden Globe 5 times, starting in 1956 (""The Rainmaker"") and including ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" (1962) and ""Atlantic City"" (1980). He appears as #19 on the AFI list of Top 50 Screen Legends.FWIW - Lancaster was interested in the film because he had a troubled child of his own.Judy Garland (1922-69) plays a new teacher at Lancaster's institution. Garland is a legend, more than half a century after her untimely death. She's best remembered for her singing career, but as an actress she was equally distinguished, winning a Juvenile Oscar (1940) and a Golden Globe (""A Star is Born"", 1954), and receiving 2 Oscar nominations (""A Star is Born"", Judgment at Nuremberg"").The excellent supporting cast includes Gena Rowlands, Steven Hill, and John Marley.Gena Rowlands (1930) was the film director's (John Cassavetes) wife and an excellent actress, twice nominated for an Oscar - ""Gloria"" (1980) and ""A Woman Under the Influence"" (1974) - and a 3 time Emmy winner - ""The Betty Ford Story"" (1987), ""Face of a Stranger"" (1991), and ""Hysterical Blindness"" (2002). Rowlands plays the mother of the child that Garland tries to help.Steven Hill (1922) plays Rowlands' divorced husband. We know Hill best from his Emmy nominated performance as the DA from ""Law and Order"" (1990-2000).Paul Stewart (1908-86) made a career playing gangsters but his first film may be his most noted role - the reporter in ""Citizen Kane"" (1941). Stewart plays a colleague of Lancaster.Director John Cassavetes (1929-89) was a pioneer of the cinema verite genre, as an actor and a director. He's probably best known for his Oscar nominated role in ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967) or as the husband in ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968), but these were the roles he took to make the money he needed to produce the films he wanted to make, such as ""Faces"" (1968), ""Husbands"" (1970), ""A Woman Under the Influence"", and ""Gloria"" (1980).Joseph LaShelle (1900-89) is the cinematographer. He won an Oscar for ""Laura"" (1944) and had 8 more nominations for films including ""The Apartment"" (1960) and ""Marty"" (1955). He was particularly skilled in the German expressionist type of filming, but none of that is apparent here.The film was shot at Pacific State Hospital in California and includes dozens of patients in various scenes. The major theme advanced is that children with disabilities have to be segregated and that parents are unable to take care of them adequately. But, this segregation requires that the State provide adequate treatment, and if done early enough and with sufficient skill and concern, the children can make progress. Such a POV was progressive in 1960, even though by today's standards it seems draconian.Films about mental hospitals were not new. Hitchcock's 1945 thriller ""Spellbound"", Olivia de Havilland's ""The Snake Pit"" (1949), and ""David and Lisa"" (1962) are among the most notable prior films, although only ""David and Lisa"" focused on children. More recent films include ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975), ""Rain Man"" (1988), and ""Sling Blade"" (1996).Almost every member of the cast was disappointed with the film, even though it received some good critical notices. Time magazine said ""Lancaster has never been better"" and The NY Times called it ""a forthright, moving documentation"" and said ""one should learn a great deal from this picture.""The top grossing films in 1963 were ""Cleopatra"", ""How the West was Won"", ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"", ""The Birds"", and ""Tom Jones"". The Oscars went to ""Tom Jones"" (Picture, Director) and ""Hud"" (Actress, Supporting Actor). Sidney Poitier won as best actor for ""Lilies of the Field"". Other notable releases that year were ""8 "", ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia With Love"", ""El Dorado"", ""The Great Escape"", ""Irma la Douce"",  ""Lord of the Flies"", and ""The Pink Panther"".Bottom line - interesting from an historical point of view as a picture of advanced care circa 1960, but otherwise not a great film per se.",3,Interesting from an historical perspective,1315180800,"09 5,

276439,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6301965876,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 5]","What an odd, unexpected movie this is. Stanley Kramer reunited Burt Lancaster and Judy Garland from his 1961 ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" for this grim near-docudrama about mentally disabled children in a state-run institution. Again working from a script by Abby Mann, Kramer handed over the directorial reins to John Cassavetes in only his third film. Some of Cassavetes' cinema-verit&eacute; style is on display here, though there are definitely enough soap opera turns to make you realize that this is ultimately a social message film.The director cast real patients from the Pacific State Hospital in Pomona, California, as most of the handicapped children and in one harrowing scene, as the mentally defective adults. This lends a searing veracity to many of the scenes, and the effect is mesmerizing. Intriguingly, a few are actors, and you are likely to recognize a quick glimpse of Billy Mumy (Will Robinson in TV's ""Lost in Space"") as one of the children. In the central role of Reuben, a borderline case, a twelve-year old actor named Bruce Ritchey is convincing in evoking the emotional isolation and inward terrorism of his character. The plot revolves around Reuben and the battle of wills over his treatment between Dr. Matthew Clark, the fair-minded director of the mental hospital, and Jean Hansen, a newly hired teacher.Lancaster is such a forthright screen presence that he is automatically credible in the authority role of Clark. Garland, looking bloated and overly made up, has a role that suits her persona at the time. As Jean, she poignantly conveys an unfulfilled maternal instinct especially as she starts to focus most of her time on Reuben to the inadvertent detriment of the other children. Even without an Arlen song, Garland can capture the internal tremolo of a woman whose only avenue for love is the children. Obviously the character was tailored for Garland, as Jean is a former musician trained at Julliard who failed to become a concert pianist. In a defining moment, she does get to teach one simple rhyming song, ""Snowflakes"", to the children for a Thanksgiving pageant.I like the fact that there is nary a romantic spark between Lancaster and Garland in the story, as they are there to represent opposing perspectives. I only wish there was a bit more emotionalism in the way they argued about it, as it takes an hour for either one of them to raise their voices. Due mostly to Mann's unimpactful, enervating script, the whole film feels mannered in that way, which is what prevents the film from being wholly satisfying. The lack of an emotional pay-off, while realistic, does not provide the closure a viewer needs with such a desultory story.Familiar faces fill the supporting cast. Cassavetes' wife, a young Gena Rowlands, plays Reuben's brittle, guilt-ridden mother Sophie, while Steven Hill plays the emotionally disconnected father who takes Reuben to the hospital only to abandon him. Paul Stewart and John Marley play state officials who need to assess future funding of the school. It's a tough movie to sit through, but the honest depiction of the children and the state of such facilities at the time, along with the low-key sincerity of Lancaster and Garland, make this one worthwhile.",4,Emotionally Draining Drama Focuses on the Funding-Challenged Treatment of the Mentally Disabled,1154995200,"08 8, 2006",2006,3234,"['What', 'odd', 'unexpected', 'movie', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'reunited', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Judy', 'Garland', '1961', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'grim', 'near-docudrama', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'children', 'state-run', 'institution', 'Again', 'working', 'script', 'Abby', 'Mann', 'Kramer', 'handed', 'over', 'directorial', 'reins', 'John', 'Cassavetes', 'only', 'third', 'film', 'Cassavetes', 'cinema-verit', 'eacute', 'style', 'display', 'here', 'are', 'definitely', 'enough', 'soap', 'opera', 'make', 'realize', 'ultimately', 'social', 'message', 'film.The', 'director', 'cast', 'real', 'patients', 'Pacific', 'State', 'Hospital', 'Pomona', 'California', 'most', 'handicapped', 'children', 'one', 'harrowing', 'scene', 'mentally', 'defective', 'adults', 'searing', 'veracity', 'many', 'scenes', 'effect', 'mesmerizing', 'Intriguingly', 'few', 'are', 'actors', 'are', 'likely', 'recognize', 'quick', 'glimpse', 'Billy', 'Mumy', 'Will', 'Robinson', 'TV', 'Lost', 'Space', 'one', 'children', 'central', 'role', 'Reuben', 'borderline', 'case', 'twelve-year', 'old', 'actor', 'named', 'Bruce', 'Ritchey', 'convincing', 'evoking', 'emotional', 'isolation', 'inward', 'terrorism', 'character', 'plot', 'Reuben', 'battle', 'wills', 'treatment', 'Dr.', 'Matthew', 'Clark', 'fair-minded', 'director', 'mental', 'hospital', 'Jean', 'Hansen', 'newly', 'hired', 'teacher.Lancaster', 'such', 'forthright', 'screen', 'presence', 'automatically', 'credible', 'authority', 'role', 'Clark', 'Garland', 'looking', 'bloated', 'overly', 'made', 'up', 'role', 'suits', 'persona', 'time', 'Jean', 'poignantly', 'conveys', 'unfulfilled', 'maternal', 'instinct', 'especially', 'focus', 'most', 'time', 'Reuben', 'inadvertent', 'detriment', 'other', 'children', 'Even', 'Arlen', 'song', 'Garland', 'can', 'capture', 'internal', 'tremolo', 'woman', 'only', 'avenue', 'love', 'children', 'Obviously', 'character', 'was', 'tailored', 'Garland', 'Jean', 'former', 'musician', 'trained', 'Julliard', 'who', 'failed', 'become', 'concert', 'pianist', 'defining', 'moment', 'get', 'teach', 'one', 'simple', 'rhyming', 'song', 'Snowflakes', 'children', 'Thanksgiving', 'pageant.I', 'fact', 'nary', 'romantic', 'spark', 'Lancaster', 'Garland', 'story', 'are', 'there', 'represent', 'opposing', 'perspectives', 'only', 'wish', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'emotionalism', 'way', 'argued', 'hour', 'one', 'raise', 'voices', 'Due', 'mostly', 'Mann', 'unimpactful', 'enervating', 'script', 'whole', 'film', 'feels', 'mannered', 'way', 'what', 'film', 'being', 'wholly', 'satisfying', 'lack', 'emotional', 'pay-off', 'realistic', 'not', 'provide', 'closure', 'viewer', 'desultory', 'story.Familiar', 'fill', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Cassavetes', 'wife', 'young', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'Reuben', 'brittle', 'guilt-ridden', 'mother', 'Sophie', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'emotionally', 'disconnected', 'father', 'who', 'Reuben', 'hospital', 'only', 'abandon', 'Paul', 'Stewart', 'John', 'Marley', 'play', 'state', 'officials', 'who', 'need', 'assess', 'future', 'funding', 'school', 'tough', 'movie', 'sit', 'honest', 'depiction', 'children', 'state', 'such', 'facilities', 'time', 'low-key', 'sincerity', 'Lancaster', 'Garland', 'make', 'one', 'worthwhile']",A Child Is Waiting VHS
276440,AJLW1DZSHOVGW,6301965876,"Elaine Campbell ""Desert Dweller""","[6, 7]","If, at some point in this movie, you do not cry, you have got to be made of stone. At its ending, I could not get up from my chair, and was so overwhelmed that I sat there and cried. Now I am better. But I do believe that some of this sorrow will never go away.There is a GREAT cast of actors. I believe this is the best performance of Burt Lancaster. He is mesmerizing throughout the movie. Judy Garland seems full of sorrow herself. Her emotional struggle to find meaning in her life, and the suffering she endures because she cares so very much for the retarded children, are very honestly portrayed. I like her in the final scene of the film when her deep caring combines with her natural vivacity and warmth. Steven Hill is terrific as the father of the child most focused upon in the story. There is a very fine scene between Hill and Paul Stewart, who plays a close working associate of Lancaster, the director of the institution.  And this child himself gives an incredible performance. I believe he should have received a special academy award.""The Children,"" as they are listed in the titles, have many of the retarded among them. Credit must be given to the director's great ingenuity and a kind of genius that he knew how to and succeeded in drawing out excellent performances. In short, he really knew how to work with these kids.The story: Highly educated parents leave their boy in this institution after finally accepting that he is, as his father puts it, ""defective.""  They never visit him.  Garland, who comes to work at the institution, just having given up on a career as a pianist, and the boy form a close bond, and she, against the director's wishes, tries to get the mother involved in the boy's life.  The result is not good, but only more turmoil is caused.  In the end, we find that what is a small victory for a non-retarded person can be a great victory for the mentally impaired.

Director John Cassavetes' film, though flawed over wrangling with Producer Stanley Kramer, is still an effective and moving motion picture about an institution housing and treating retarded children to the full extent of their abilities. One heartbreak is Reuben Widdicombe, the focal child of this film, portrayed brilliantly by Bruce Ritchey who is virtually abandoned by his affluent parents and is effectively on the boarder line of retardation. The other heartbreak is Jean Hansen portrayed by Judy Garland. She applies for a job at the institution hoping that she can help these children and perhaps make a difference in her own life as well. The director of the institute Dr. Matthew Clark played by Burt Lancaster has the tough job of making all concerned understand that each child has a limit of success that each can obtain no matter how small or insignificant it may seem. So, one real heartbreak of this film is that realization. Judy Garland's character must come to terms with that fact if she is to be effective at all and her performance is so real and sincere that you feel that heartbreak through her. For me the payoff in this film is with Reuben's father, effectively played by Steven Hill, who comes to accept his son as the human being he is with all the emotions and feelings that he is able to bare.

Here he`s in the beginning of his career, directing his wife Gena Rowlands but also Hollywood greats JUDY GARLAND and BURT LANCASTER in a film about mentally handicapped children. Only lead-actor Bruce Ritchey is a regular &quot;player&quot; and not one of the institutionalised... The film works pretty well on several levels; It critisise old-fashioned ideas and ways of how 2 treat the ones that are not q u i t e like everyone else. It summons up of how parents may react when they do have a child that is not &quot;normal&quot; and their grief when they realise this... It is NOT a film that is easy 2 swallow, but A CHILD IS WAITING and its kind are important as a critical comment to our society. Judy, Burt, Bruce, Gena and Steven Hill(watch his confrontation scene with Christine Lahti in RUNNING ON EMPTY, as River Phoenix`s grandpa) are all great. Judy is wonderfully low-key in this film.

It was producer Stanley Kramer who wanted Judy for this film after her cameo appearance as Irene Hoffman in his impressive all-star JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG.

276444,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,6301965876,JGC,"[2, 2]","""A Child Is Waiting"" is one of the very best Judy Garland films. It is an affirming story with powerful performances and a well-rounded script that doesn't preach or go off in the deep yonder like so many films during this time period are known to do. Perhaps the reason why the film is so unappreciated and subsequently unknown is because Judy doesn't sing and dance and isn't glamorous.Instead Miss Garland plays against type as the female lead Jean Hansen, brought on board to be a teaching assistant in a school for develop mentally delayed children. Judy has such a powerful presence in each and every one of her scenes because she is absolute and this viewer can tell that she wholeheartedly believed in the cause and the plight of these children.Burt Lancaster was equally brilliant as the staff doctor who oversaw the school. During the first maybe half of the movie Dr. Clark and Miss Hansen were at odds. And that's why this is probably Judy Garland's most defining picture ever. Because she was the quintessential patron saint.Miss Hansen had so much love and sympathy and sorrow for this little boy whose parents literally threw him away. When she weeps for this poor child the audience can see that she is really and sincerely hurt. But as Dr. Clark eloquently displayed to Miss Hansen these children do not need a martyr to weep for them, they need someone to teach them how to be responsible and upstanding people.As I stated there isn't another movie that I can think of from Miss Garland's very long and impressive film resume that comes close to the emotions displayed in this picture. That is because Judy Garland was truly no different from the child she was trying most to protect. She knew what it was like to be thrown away and she knew what it was to be society's victim. She knew how cruel and heartless this world is.In a way it does surprise me that Judy wasn't nominated for an Oscar. But again that's probably because the popular audience wasn't ready to see Judy in such a dramatic or common role.This movie is sometimes shown on Retroplex. If you're interested in seeing another powerful film that goes against the norm then I also recommend ""The Sterile Cuckoo"" with Liza. ""A Child Is Waiting"" is an important movie because it articulates what could happen if we don't treat people like people. And I know it can happen if we let our emotions get the better of us.",5,Saint Judy that wants to save the world,1228089600,"12 1, 2008",2008,2396,"['Child', 'Waiting', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'films', 'affirming', 'story', 'powerful', 'performances', 'well-rounded', 'script', ""n't"", 'preach', 'go', 'off', 'deep', 'yonder', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'time', 'period', 'are', 'known', 'do', 'Perhaps', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'unappreciated', 'subsequently', 'unknown', 'Judy', ""n't"", 'sing', 'dance', ""n't"", 'glamorous.Instead', 'Miss', 'Garland', 'type', 'female', 'lead', 'Jean', 'Hansen', 'brought', 'board', 'be', 'teaching', 'assistant', 'school', 'develop', 'mentally', 'delayed', 'children', 'Judy', 'powerful', 'presence', 'one', 'scenes', 'absolute', 'viewer', 'can', 'tell', 'wholeheartedly', 'believed', 'cause', 'plight', 'children.Burt', 'Lancaster', 'was', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'staff', 'doctor', 'who', 'oversaw', 'school', 'first', 'maybe', 'half', 'movie', 'Dr.', 'Clark', 'Miss', 'Hansen', 'were', 'odds', 'why', 'probably', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'most', 'defining', 'picture', 'ever', 'was', 'quintessential', 'patron', 'saint.Miss', 'Hansen', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'sympathy', 'sorrow', 'little', 'boy', 'parents', 'literally', 'threw', 'away', 'When', 'poor', 'child', 'audience', 'can', 'see', 'really', 'sincerely', 'hurt', 'Dr.', 'Clark', 'eloquently', 'displayed', 'Miss', 'Hansen', 'children', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'martyr', 'weep', 'need', 'someone', 'teach', 'how', 'be', 'responsible', 'upstanding', 'people.As', 'stated', ""n't"", 'movie', 'can', 'think', 'Miss', 'Garland', 'very', 'long', 'impressive', 'film', 'resume', 'close', 'emotions', 'displayed', 'picture', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'was', 'truly', 'different', 'child', 'was', 'trying', 'most', 'protect', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'thrown', 'away', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'society', 'victim', 'knew', 'how', 'cruel', 'heartless', 'world', 'way', 'surprise', 'Judy', 'was', ""n't"", 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'again', 'probably', 'popular', 'audience', 'was', ""n't"", 'ready', 'see', 'Judy', 'such', 'dramatic', 'common', 'role.This', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'shown', 'Retroplex', ""'re"", 'interested', 'seeing', 'powerful', 'film', 'norm', 'then', 'also', 'recommend', 'Sterile', 'Cuckoo', 'Liza', 'Child', 'Waiting', 'important', 'movie', 'what', 'could', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'treat', 'people', 'people', 'know', 'can', 'happen', 'let', 'emotions', 'get', 'better']",A Child Is Waiting VHS

There has never been a film that opened my eyes so much. &quot; A Child Is Waiting&quot; is one of the  most significant pictures of society ever made, without a doubt. The basis  for the difficult story is dealing with retarded children, nurturing them,  trying to help them when no one else will help them...  or love them. Burt  Lancaster, in a crisply delivered performance, is a stern but kind  headmaster at an institution for retarded children. At the beginning of the  film, a woman (Judy Garland, in a beautifully dramatic performance) comes  to the school to apply for the position of music teacher at the school. She  immediately attracts a disturbed child (Bruce Ritchey), and is disturbed  that nobody, even his own parents, ever visit him. She tries to help the  child, only to hurt him even more when Lancaster refuses to let him see his  parents.

This is a rare commodity:  a film that stays in your mind for hours, even days, after the closing credits.When Jean Harlen (Judy Garland's character) enters the classroom of disabled children for the first time, and the (autistic) little boy, Reuben (Bruce Ritchey) reaches out to touch her hand... well, from that point I was absorbed, hook, line & sinker, in this story.  You will only rarely find a film like this one with its humanity and heart being made today.It was amazing the way John Cassevetes led the viewer from distrusting the seemingly hard-as-nails director of the institution (Burt Lancaster) into thinking, after all, that he had a good point: Jean wasn't going to do any good for Reuben or for any of these children with just pity and sympathy.  Not that her sympathy wasn't important, but she needed to teach them, too, to the best of her ability.  Again, amazing, the way Cassevetes led the viewer from feeling defensive of Judy Garland's character into realizing that Jean needed to become less emotional about these children and more active on their behalf.The little boy who plays Reuben gives an absolutely heartbreaking performance.  Frankly it brings tears to my eyes just thinking about some of his moments in this film.  A once-in-a-lifetime child's performance that should be seen by any child actor today!Cassavetes found brief shining moments (or in some cases, not so shining in terms of their character) for all his cast, even bit players like the actors who play the parents of the disabled children, coming for visiting day at the institution.  The realistic interaction between these actors and the children - well, again, you just don't see this realism too often in any film.Highly, highly recommended.",5,One of the best films you've probably never seen:,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,1825,"['CHILD', 'IS', 'WAITING', 'quietest', 'possible', 'way', 'great', 'emotional', 'whallop', 'rare', 'commodity', 'film', 'mind', 'hours', 'even', 'days', 'closing', 'credits.When', 'Jean', 'Harlen', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'character', 'classroom', 'disabled', 'children', 'first', 'time', 'autistic', 'little', 'boy', 'Reuben', 'Bruce', 'Ritchey', 'out', 'touch', 'hand', 'well', 'point', 'was', 'absorbed', 'hook', 'line', 'sinker', 'story', 'will', 'only', 'rarely', 'find', 'film', 'one', 'humanity', 'heart', 'being', 'made', 'today.It', 'was', 'amazing', 'way', 'John', 'Cassevetes', 'led', 'viewer', 'distrusting', 'seemingly', 'hard-as-nails', 'director', 'institution', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'thinking', 'had', 'good', 'point', 'Jean', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'do', 'good', 'Reuben', 'children', 'just', 'pity', 'sympathy', 'Not', 'sympathy', 'was', ""n't"", 'important', 'needed', 'teach', 'too', 'best', 'ability', 'Again', 'amazing', 'way', 'Cassevetes', 'led', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'defensive', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'character', 'realizing', 'Jean', 'needed', 'become', 'less', 'emotional', 'children', 'more', 'active', 'behalf.The', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'Reuben', 'absolutely', 'heartbreaking', 'performance', 'Frankly', 'tears', 'eyes', 'just', 'thinking', 'moments', 'film', 'once-in-a-lifetime', 'child', 'performance', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'child', 'actor', 'today', 'found', 'brief', 'shining', 'moments', 'cases', 'not', 'so', 'shining', 'terms', 'character', 'cast', 'even', 'players', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'parents', 'disabled', 'children', 'coming', 'visiting', 'day', 'institution', 'realistic', 'interaction', 'actors', 'children', 'well', 'again', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'realism', 'too', 'often', 'film.Highly', 'highly', 'recommended']",A Child Is Waiting VHS
276455,AXHCIHVT92GYF,6301965876,The CinemaScope Cat,"[2, 2]","When a new teacher (Judy Garland) joins the staff of a school dedicated to teaching mentally challenged (what used to be called retarded) children and young adults, she immediately clashes with the director (Burt Lancaster) of the institution over his methods. The film was directed by the inventive John Cassavetes but it was produced by uninventive Stanley Kramer and they clashed over the direction the film was taking as well as its ""message"". Alas, as the producer Kramer won by firing Cassavetes. The film is overtly sentimental and rather dubious in its sociological theories. But Cassavetes left his mark on the film, principally on the excellent performances. Garland, in particular, gives a sensitive nuanced performance but there's also excellent work from Gena Rowlands and Steven Hill as the divorced parents of a disturbed child who Garland takes under her wing. The film benefits by using actual disabled children rather than professional child actors playing mentally challenged although I did spot Billy Mumy (LOST IN SPACE) in there. The score by Ernest Gold is rather good except for a pretentious main title (percussion and a cacophonous children's chorus).
