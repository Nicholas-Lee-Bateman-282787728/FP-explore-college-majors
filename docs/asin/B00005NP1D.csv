669666,A20ITI6SAIKPK4,B00005NP1D,Hoosier Hayseed,"[0, 0]","I've just been watching Martina's video - what was the question again?Oh, yeah!  Martina's singing.  (Sorry, those incredible blue eyes had me in a total trance.)Well, not only is Martina a complete knockout, and not only does she have a pair of eyes such as the kind of eyes that men have committed mayhem for all over the world, but she also has the most indestructible pair of lungs ever, and in such a little bitty gal!She is, really and truly, a once in a lifetime talent, and I don't know that I've ever seen a better one.Oh, there have been other great singers, and no one would short-change the likes of Tammy Wynette or Patsy Cline, but Martina is almost in a class by herself.As far as the sheer strength and quality of her voice, only Juice Newton has ever come close, of those I can recall.Of course, each singer has their own style, and sings their own type of music, usually those songs that play to the strength of their voice qualities.  So it's hard to really compare, when one may do a particular style of song much better than any other artist, but fail miserably in other comparisons.But, hey!  Who's comparing?  I'm certainly not - I guess it's just a natural thing to do to mentally compare one singer against another, but that's really not fair, to any of them.Suffice it to say that they all shine, in their own particular way.  (It's just that some seem to shine a little brighter than others.)But Martina is wonderful.

The video format is 4:3 and the sound is only stereo, not surround sound.This DVD is a nice compliment to another Martina DVD I have, aptly titled Martina, because not a lot of videos overlap.

669669,A3S5C7Y0WT2Q9N,B00005NP1D,J. Lizzi,"[15, 15]","For a compilation of Martina McBride's greatest hits, it seems odd to me that six albums worth of music could only produce the eleven videos found on this DVD (two are even listed as ""bonus"" tracks).  Everything on this disc is enjoyable, but I wish there were more songs . . .As with most music DVDs, I purchased this not only as a collector's item, but also to learn more about the artist and what went into creating the music videos.  I give a solid A-rating to the songs and the quality of the videos, with special note to the outstanding imagery and story-telling in ""Independence Day,"" ""Wild Angels,"" ""A Broken Wing,"" ""Love's the Only House,"" and ""Cheap Whiskey.""  I wasn't a big Martina McBride fan before I bought this DVD, but I'm more of one now.Aside from the too-small sampling of videos, a couple other minor disappointments keep me from giving a 5-star rating.  I looked around for any information about who directed the videos, and where and when they were filmed.  All I found (even in the liner notes) was ""various original producers"" and ""various video directors.""  I really thought many of the videos were brilliant; I can't believe there were no credits for them.  Also, the ""Greatest Hits"" CD has many more songs besides those included on the DVD.  I'm not sure what the reasoning was in leaving so many ""hits"" off of the video collection, but I expected that the listed songs would be the same.  Did the missing songs not have videos?The option of watching the tracks with or without the commentary between them is a good feature.  The CMT interview footage with Martina is okay, but some ""behind the scenes"" footage would have added another great dimension that is lacking here.Overall, this is a good DVD that I would recommend to just about anyone, especially fans of Martina.",4,Good music; well-produced videos; run-time is too short,1015113600,"03 3, 2002",2002,1801,"['compilation', 'Martina', 'McBride', 'greatest', 'hits', 'odd', 'six', 'albums', 'music', 'could', 'only', 'produce', 'eleven', 'videos', 'found', 'DVD', 'two', 'are', 'even', 'listed', 'bonus', 'tracks', 'Everything', 'disc', 'enjoyable', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'songs', '.As', 'most', 'music', 'DVDs', 'purchased', 'not', 'only', 'collector', 'item', 'also', 'learn', 'more', 'artist', 'what', 'went', 'creating', 'music', 'videos', 'give', 'solid', 'A-rating', 'songs', 'quality', 'videos', 'special', 'note', 'outstanding', 'imagery', 'story-telling', 'Independence', 'Day', 'Wild', 'Angels', 'A', 'Broken', 'Wing', 'Love', 'Only', 'House', 'Cheap', 'Whiskey', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'Martina', 'McBride', 'fan', 'bought', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'more', 'one', 'now.Aside', 'too-small', 'sampling', 'videos', 'couple', 'other', 'minor', 'disappointments', 'keep', 'giving', '5-star', 'rating', 'looked', 'information', 'who', 'directed', 'videos', 'where', 'when', 'were', 'filmed', 'found', 'even', 'liner', 'notes', 'was', 'various', 'original', 'producers', 'various', 'video', 'directors', 'really', 'thought', 'many', 'videos', 'were', 'brilliant', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'were', 'credits', 'Also', 'Greatest', 'Hits', 'CD', 'many', 'more', 'songs', 'included', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'reasoning', 'was', 'leaving', 'so', 'many', 'hits', 'video', 'collection', 'expected', 'listed', 'songs', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'Did', 'missing', 'songs', 'not', 'have', 'videos', 'option', 'watching', 'tracks', 'commentary', 'good', 'feature', 'CMT', 'interview', 'footage', 'Martina', 'okay', 'scenes', 'footage', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'great', 'dimension', 'lacking', 'here.Overall', 'good', 'DVD', 'would', 'recommend', 'just', 'anyone', 'especially', 'fans', 'Martina']",N/A
