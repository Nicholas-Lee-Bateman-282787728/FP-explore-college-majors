Excellent performances from all the actors in this movie with a very satisfying ending. Worth watching.,5,Dark Power,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,237,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Fast', 'paced', 'very', 'exciting', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flanery', 'just', 'better', 'better', 'movie', 'Excellent', 'performances', 'actors', 'movie', 'very', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'Worth', 'watching']",Dark Power
1641707,A1Z5KRGK36CQSR,B00C3JUJJS,K. Galloway,"[0, 0]","Well, ok.  There's Sean Patrick Flanery and Kristanna Loken.  But, once you've said they are in it, you've about said everything as far as they go.  Not that they did a bad job with the acting.  But, I'm not sure ANYONE could have saved this dud.Like others, I am left with the feeling that about as much film was left on the editing floor as was in THIS version of the movie.  I really don't care to try to find out if there is another version or not after watching this one.*spoiler alert*  I can see what they were TRYING to reach for with the ending when Sean Patrick Flanery's character &#34;Archer&#34; is suddenly yanked from the case in the final ten minutes and Kristanna Loken's character &#34;solves&#34; that one along with the final beach scene which was innuendo about her ties to this secret dark fraternity of movers and shakers rather than just to get a shot of her in a bikini.But, I found myself laughing and shouting at the screen, &#34;Seriously?  THAT was the best you could come up with?&#34;The true (secret) &#34;Dark Power&#34;, as it were, was how on earth this movie was MADE.  Must be a secret dark fraternity at work there somewhere.  We'll call them the &#34;deluminati&#34;.Which is a shame really, since I'm somewhat of a fan of this type of plot.  But, even being predisposed to liking the type of plot or the talents of the main cast, which through no fault of their own, just wasn't enough to save this from being really, REALLY bad.",2,"Well, there's an hour and a half I won't get back.",1398297600,"04 24, 2014",2014,1469,"['Well', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flanery', 'Kristanna', 'Loken', 'once', ""'ve"", 'said', 'are', ""'ve"", 'said', 'everything', 'as', 'far', 'go', 'Not', 'did', 'bad', 'job', 'acting', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'ANYONE', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'dud.Like', 'others', 'am', 'left', 'feeling', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'was', 'left', 'editing', 'floor', 'was', 'THIS', 'version', 'movie', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'version', 'not', 'watching', 'one', '*spoiler', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'were', 'TRYING', 'reach', 'ending', 'when', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flanery', 'character', '34', 'Archer', '34', 'suddenly', 'yanked', 'case', 'final', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Kristanna', 'Loken', 'character', '34', 'solves', '34', 'one', 'final', 'beach', 'scene', 'was', 'innuendo', 'ties', 'secret', 'dark', 'fraternity', 'movers', 'shakers', 'rather', 'just', 'get', 'shot', 'bikini.But', 'found', 'laughing', 'shouting', 'screen', '34', 'Seriously', 'was', 'best', 'could', 'come', 'up', '34', 'true', 'secret', '34', 'Dark', 'Power', '34', 'were', 'was', 'how', 'earth', 'movie', 'was', 'MADE', 'Must', 'be', 'secret', 'dark', 'fraternity', 'work', 'there', 'somewhere', ""'ll"", 'call', '34', 'deluminati', '34', '.Which', 'shame', 'really', ""'m"", 'somewhat', 'fan', 'type', 'plot', 'even', 'being', 'predisposed', 'liking', 'type', 'plot', 'talents', 'main', 'cast', 'fault', 'own', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'save', 'being', 'really', 'REALLY', 'bad']",Dark Power

The Boston mayor's office is a empty warehouse of a building.  The police car was a Nissan with no decals and just a light put on top for the Boston Police Dept. I'm really sorry to say this was a total waste of time and except for the stars there is really no one in the movie at all.
