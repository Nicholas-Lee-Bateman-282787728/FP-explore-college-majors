I had a little trouble understanding some of the words since I'm slightly hard or hearing and depend on subtitles to understand British and Irish accents. There are no subtitles on these discs. BUT ... the acting and storylines were so compelling that I had to continue, despite not catching every word. I don't know how close to reality this series is, but it SEEMS very real. Plenty of political intrigue and human interest. Collins does a great, though low-key, job and is supported by a fantastic ensemble. I hated to see this series end and recommend it highly.",5,"Incredible show, great acting and political insight",1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,632,"['watching', 'first', 'episode', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'would', 'continue', 'had', 'little', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'words', ""'m"", 'slightly', 'hard', 'hearing', 'depend', 'subtitles', 'understand', 'British', 'Irish', 'accents', 'are', 'subtitles', 'discs', 'BUT', 'acting', 'storylines', 'were', 'so', 'compelling', 'had', 'continue', 'not', 'catching', 'word', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'close', 'reality', 'series', 'SEEMS', 'very', 'real', 'Plenty', 'political', 'intrigue', 'human', 'interest', 'Collins', 'great', 'low-key', 'job', 'supported', 'fantastic', 'ensemble', 'hated', 'see', 'series', 'end', 'recommend', 'highly']",N/A

1411507,A1O1U9V9V4PXAG,B004JMSIRM,Meryl M.,"[0, 0]","I thought the first series was better crafted than the second, and it was interesting to see how an ambassador and an embassy operates, especially since I knew an ambassador, my cousin, while spending a year teaching in the city where he was posted.In the second, the directing was not consistent; some scenes were poorly directed.The plots seemed more simplistic, and were backed by that saccharine music which shows that 'we are good and righteous and are doing a good and righteous thing'. Pauline Collins' character is less crisp and competent and human in the 2nd, more given to brief, unprofessional outbursts, which she wasn't in the first. Her affair with a businessman seemed inauthentic from the start. The businessman, himself, seemed curiously inauthentic and, when he walked away after having been kidnapped, the reasons he gives are incomprehensible -- worse, the ambassador's reaction is too accepting and unquestioning. The whole kidnapping sequence lacked coherence and authenticity, I thought.Finally, the tent-like clothes on the women would surely make the actors howl today, even given that the series was done in 1998.(I am with the folks who would like to have subtitles as a choice.)",3,First series better than second.

She is a consummate actress and usually a real character actress instead of lead...but she is a joy to watch in anything. As the Ambassador she is an English diplomat sent to Dublin representing Great Britain . Relations between the two countries have always been fractious since GB once ruled then overruled leading finally to The Rising in 1916 in the South dividing the country and in the 60's lead to The Troubles...civil war mostly played out in the  North between the Ulster Constabulary and the Irish Republican Army..it has finally stopped after a truce led to the economy booming but memories of real injustices done can flare up years later. This is what she deals with handling trade agreements, and diplomatic relations. Her personal life was abruptly dashed when stationed in the Middle East , her car was bombed while her husband was driving it and killed. Her two sons are affected by this and she has them with her instead of boarding school but they both feel the stress of security necessity and body guards etc. Plots are timely and interesting as a woman with power in a man's domain she is articulate and works in truth not diplomacy...I like the way it presents and Pauline Collins is great to watch.Highly recommend!",5,Consummate actress!,1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,1331,"['Ambassador', 'starring', 'role', 'Ms', 'Collins', 'glamorous', 'change', 'consummate', 'actress', 'usually', 'real', 'character', 'actress', 'instead', 'lead', 'joy', 'watch', 'anything', 'Ambassador', 'English', 'diplomat', 'sent', 'Dublin', 'representing', 'Great', 'Britain', 'Relations', 'two', 'countries', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fractious', 'GB', 'once', 'ruled', 'then', 'overruled', 'leading', 'finally', 'Rising', '1916', 'South', 'dividing', 'country', '60', 'lead', 'Troubles', 'civil', 'war', 'mostly', 'played', 'out', 'North', 'Ulster', 'Constabulary', 'Irish', 'Republican', 'Army..it', 'finally', 'stopped', 'truce', 'led', 'economy', 'booming', 'memories', 'real', 'injustices', 'done', 'can', 'flare', 'up', 'years', 'later', 'what', 'handling', 'trade', 'agreements', 'diplomatic', 'relations', 'personal', 'life', 'was', 'abruptly', 'dashed', 'when', 'stationed', 'Middle', 'East', 'car', 'was', 'bombed', 'husband', 'was', 'driving', 'killed', 'two', 'sons', 'are', 'affected', 'instead', 'boarding', 'school', 'feel', 'stress', 'security', 'necessity', 'body', 'guards', 'etc', 'Plots', 'are', 'timely', 'interesting', 'woman', 'power', 'man', 'domain', 'articulate', 'truth', 'not', 'diplomacy', 'way', 'Pauline', 'Collins', 'great', 'watch.Highly', 'recommend']",N/A

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[11, 12]","Gripping and well-acted BBC Ireland series - now all in one DVD setThis superb BBC Ireland TV series from 1997 and 1998 has been available as separate volumes for each of its two seasons but now BFS Video has packaged the COMPLETE series in one, more affordable, package.I was not aware of the series before this ""Complete"" set and, unlike many others, I had never seen its star, Pauline Collins, before - having never watched the BBC series Upstairs Downstairs on PBS. But I'm really impressed by Collins as an actress for viewing this set.The plot revolves around Harriet Smith, the British Ambassador to Ireland (a fictional character), arriving to take her post in Dublin and how she must deal with being a British official in what is - for all intents - a foreign country. Her authority only extended to the outside walls of the British Consulate. Smith is a widow (you will learn why as you watch the series) and has three children, ranging from a grade school son to a college-aged son from whom she is somewhat estranged. The action takes place in the late 1990s when there are problems of drugs, terrorism, cults and the general tension between the British and the Irish population. All this gives makes Smith's job a tough one. But Collins plays Harriet with compassion and the scripts are of the high quality that puts American network television to shame. This is another case of discovering shows that were never aired in the US for home viewing.Because it takes place in Ireland, there are Irish accents to deal with. These can sometimes be thick but, generally, you'll have no problem.The stories are contemporary so this is not a ""period drama"" like Upstairs Downstairs or the various BBC England mystery series. These are human dramas (including Smith having to balance her work and family life) and I can highly recommend it. Besides, you can see the whole series (12 50-minute episodes) with one package.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,Gripping and well-acted BBC Ireland series - now all in one DVD set,1300233600,"03 16, 2011",2011,1956,"['Gripping', 'well-acted', 'BBC', 'Ireland', 'series', 'now', 'one', 'DVD', 'setThis', 'superb', 'BBC', 'Ireland', 'TV', 'series', '1997', '1998', 'been', 'available', 'separate', 'volumes', 'two', 'seasons', 'now', 'BFS', 'Video', 'packaged', 'COMPLETE', 'series', 'one', 'more', 'affordable', 'package.I', 'was', 'not', 'aware', 'series', 'Complete', 'set', 'many', 'others', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'star', 'Pauline', 'Collins', 'having', 'never', 'watched', 'BBC', 'series', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'PBS', ""'m"", 'really', 'impressed', 'Collins', 'actress', 'viewing', 'set.The', 'plot', 'Harriet', 'Smith', 'British', 'Ambassador', 'Ireland', 'fictional', 'character', 'arriving', 'take', 'post', 'Dublin', 'how', 'must', 'deal', 'being', 'British', 'official', 'what', 'intents', 'foreign', 'country', 'authority', 'only', 'extended', 'outside', 'walls', 'British', 'Consulate', 'Smith', 'widow', 'will', 'learn', 'why', 'watch', 'series', 'three', 'children', 'ranging', 'grade', 'school', 'son', 'college-aged', 'son', 'whom', 'somewhat', 'estranged', 'action', 'place', 'late', '1990s', 'when', 'are', 'problems', 'drugs', 'terrorism', 'cults', 'general', 'tension', 'British', 'Irish', 'population', 'Smith', 'job', 'tough', 'one', 'Collins', 'Harriet', 'compassion', 'scripts', 'are', 'high', 'quality', 'American', 'network', 'television', 'shame', 'case', 'discovering', 'shows', 'were', 'never', 'aired', 'US', 'home', 'viewing.Because', 'place', 'Ireland', 'are', 'Irish', 'accents', 'deal', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'thick', 'generally', ""'ll"", 'have', 'problem.The', 'stories', 'are', 'contemporary', 'not', 'period', 'drama', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'various', 'BBC', 'England', 'mystery', 'series', 'are', 'human', 'dramas', 'including', 'Smith', 'having', 'balance', 'work', 'family', 'life', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend', 'can', 'see', 'whole', 'series', '12', '50-minute', 'episodes', 'one', 'package.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A
