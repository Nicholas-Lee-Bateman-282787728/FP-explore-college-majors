Well, it was a great investment. This workout is perfect for a lighter day. But, don't be fooled, it is an effective workout. It was hard enough that I felt challenged but nice for a day when I don't want too much exertion. It is a wonderful addition to my workout rotation. And, I love being able to program the chapters.",4,Better Than Expected,1274572800,"05 23, 2010",2010,443,"['Let', 'be', 'honest', 'What', 'first', 'interested', 'workout', 'was', 'Amazon', 'price', 'only', '5.99', 'thought', 'what', 'heck', 'Well', 'was', 'great', 'investment', 'workout', 'perfect', 'lighter', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'effective', 'workout', 'was', 'hard', 'enough', 'felt', 'challenged', 'nice', 'day', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'too', 'much', 'exertion', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'workout', 'rotation', 'love', 'being', 'able', 'program', 'chapters']",Kathy Smith Peel Off The Pound

You can make it as dancey or athletic as you like.  Kathy follows up the cardio with some nice muscle conditioning pilates moves for the entire body -- again, nothing too difficult, but definitely enough to know you've been worked.

Know what I mean? :-)  It's ""nice,"" to put it plain and simple.  It feels really good and is just challenging enough.  If you do it giving your best effort, you will feel worked from head to toe.  Do focus on the advice Kathy Smith gives about your form because that really adds to the results.  When I come to the upper body section, I use 3 lb. weights, whereas in other workouts, I can do 5lbs. at least.  This workout targets the muscles you are trying to get at, so you have to go a little lighter!

It's a good solid workout and is good for a pilates beginner (me) to intermediate.I found this very easy to follow and as always, Kathy is a great instructor who cues well and is great to listen to.  You almost don't need to look at the screen to see what she's talking about because she describes in detail all the moves ahead of time.  There is an aerobic segment to begin, and you engage your core throughout that.  With the toning, there is classic dumbbell type exercises and pilates floorwork (use a mat).  I really like how you can play this in any order.  Doing that keeps it fresh and interesting.Overall, this workout is really quite good - I think it's perfect for beginners to intermediate and I'm sure that if done consistantly, then you'll see results.  I certainly felt this for a day or two afterwards.  Can't wait to try this for my second time.",4,Tough but good :-),1219104000,"08 19, 2008",2008,980,"[""'m"", 'not', 'normally', 'big', 'Pilates', 'fan', 'do', 'Kathy', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'go', 'mix', 'up', 'current', 'routine', 'good', 'solid', 'workout', 'good', 'pilates', 'beginner', 'intermediate.I', 'found', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'always', 'Kathy', 'great', 'instructor', 'who', 'well', 'great', 'listen', 'almost', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'look', 'screen', 'see', 'what', 'talking', 'detail', 'moves', 'ahead', 'time', 'aerobic', 'segment', 'begin', 'engage', 'core', 'toning', 'classic', 'dumbbell', 'type', 'exercises', 'pilates', 'floorwork', 'use', 'mat', 'really', 'how', 'can', 'play', 'order', 'Doing', 'fresh', 'interesting.Overall', 'workout', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'think', 'perfect', 'beginners', 'intermediate', ""'m"", 'sure', 'done', 'consistantly', 'then', ""'ll"", 'see', 'results', 'certainly', 'felt', 'day', 'two', 'afterwards', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'try', 'second', 'time']",Kathy Smith Peel Off The Pound

I was surprised at how much I felt the muscle fatique the next day.It seems innocent enough..starting out with knee bends then waving the arms side to side to engage the obliques...it gets harder from there.The ""dance"" part is a series of leg lifts, plies, lunges, gravevines with leg lifts, and always arm movements to go with them.  I did sweat a bit--not a lot, but I did get pretty warm.  (Say a 6 1/2  out 10)The mat work was perfect for me. I liked the leg and ab section especially.

1111014,ATD5QN72ZB4MR,B000WOSAVA,Zenkitty,"[2, 2]","This is my first Kathy Smith purchase. I've rented one of her dvds in the past but I didn't like the style of that particular video. Well, I'm so glad I decided to pick this one up! Kathy is a fabulous instructor, and I rank her right up there with Denise Austin (my absolute favorite). She is constantly offering insight on how to keep perfect form for each exercise.The set reminds me of the Mandarin Oriental in Miami. The music is very Cafe del Mar. The cardio workout has no jumping so it's very easy on the joints. Some of the reviews made it sound like a dance workout, which I was not looking for. It's actually very fast-paced standing pilates with some jazz-inspired movements. All-in-all, it's an elegant routine that is simple to follow yet very engaging and fun.Next was the toning portion. The upper body workout was basically Pilates with weights. That's a very challenging combination! The lower body workout really isolated the core. My muscles were sore all over by the end of the dvd, but it was such a pleasant experience that I was already looking forward to doing it again.I'm so glad I found such an intense workout that is also so much fun (usually it's one or the other).
