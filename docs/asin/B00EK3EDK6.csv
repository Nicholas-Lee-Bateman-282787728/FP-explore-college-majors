Even if you believe 9/11 was a U.S. conspiracy, ""The Citizen"" is a powerful film that will make you value your citizenship in the U.S. and maybe think twice about how you look at the next immigrant you meet.",5,An incredible film about determination and dedication!,1381795200,"10 15, 2013",2013,396,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'actor', 'Khaled', 'Nabawy', 'prior', 'watching', 'Citizen', 'now', 'recommend', 'least', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'portrayal', 'immigrant', 'Ibrahim', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Even', 'believe', '9/11', 'was', 'U.S.', 'conspiracy', 'Citizen', 'powerful', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'value', 'citizenship', 'U.S.', 'maybe', 'think', 'twice', 'how', 'look', 'next', 'immigrant', 'meet']",The Citizen
1667558,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00EK3EDK6,Paul Allaer,"[1, 1]","""The Citizen"" (2012 release; 99 min.) brings the story of Ibrahim, originally from Lebanon, who after 12 years of trying out for the ""green card lottery"" actually wins and comes to the US, a legal immigrant. Alas, his bad fortune is to arrive in New York on September 10, 2001, yes the day before 9/11. Before we know it, he is detained, for reasons unclear, for 6 months, only to be released in March, 2002, for lack of evidence, But his troubles aren't over yet. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this movie is a lesson in civil rights and as such, right away a movie that deserves to be seen. Second, this is the debut feature of writer-director Sam Kadi, whom I speculate (I have no concrete evidence of this) is a first or second-generation immigrant himself. Third, the performance of Egyptian actor Khaled Nabawy as Ibrahim is powerful. Last but not least the ""green card lottery"" continues to this day, providing those lucky winners the opportunity to come to the US and make the American dream a reality. The DVD bonus materials come with a bunch of interviews, the most interesting of them being with writer-director Kadi, explaining that the story is based on various real life stories, but for movie purposes, he bundled them into the Ibrahim character.As a legal immigrant myself some 30 years ago (albeit not because of the ""green card lottery""), this movie really resonated for me. This country was made great by legal immigrants, in fact many Americans in one way or another descend from the early settlers, and this country continues to be made great by legal immigrants, the very fabric of our nation. All hail legal immigrants! ""The Citizen"" is definitely worth checking out.",4,All hail legal immigrants!,1397347200,"04 13, 2014",2014,1799,"['Citizen', '2012', 'release', '99', 'min', 'story', 'Ibrahim', 'originally', 'Lebanon', 'who', '12', 'years', 'trying', 'out', 'green', 'card', 'lottery', 'actually', 'US', 'legal', 'immigrant', 'Alas', 'bad', 'fortune', 'arrive', 'New', 'York', 'September', '10', '2001', 'day', '9/11', 'know', 'detained', 'reasons', 'unclear', '6', 'months', 'only', 'be', 'released', 'March', '2002', 'lack', 'evidence', 'troubles', 'are', ""n't"", 'yet', 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'spoil', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Couple', 'comments', 'first', 'movie', 'lesson', 'civil', 'rights', 'such', 'right', 'away', 'movie', 'be', 'seen', 'Second', 'debut', 'feature', 'writer-director', 'Sam', 'Kadi', 'whom', 'speculate', 'have', 'concrete', 'evidence', 'first', 'second-generation', 'immigrant', 'Third', 'performance', 'Egyptian', 'actor', 'Khaled', 'Nabawy', 'Ibrahim', 'powerful', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'green', 'card', 'lottery', 'day', 'providing', 'lucky', 'winners', 'opportunity', 'come', 'US', 'make', 'American', 'dream', 'reality', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'materials', 'come', 'bunch', 'interviews', 'most', 'interesting', 'being', 'writer-director', 'Kadi', 'explaining', 'story', 'based', 'various', 'real', 'life', 'stories', 'movie', 'purposes', 'bundled', 'Ibrahim', 'character.As', 'legal', 'immigrant', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'not', 'green', 'card', 'lottery', 'movie', 'really', 'resonated', 'country', 'was', 'made', 'great', 'legal', 'immigrants', 'fact', 'many', 'Americans', 'one', 'way', 'descend', 'early', 'settlers', 'country', 'be', 'made', 'great', 'legal', 'immigrants', 'very', 'fabric', 'nation', 'hail', 'legal', 'immigrants', 'Citizen', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",The Citizen

A moving story of ill-fated timing and the backlash from a tragedy America will never forget. Nor will the thousands of immigrants who bore the brunt of profiling, just as Ibrahim did in this film. The acting was excellent and the cinematography captured the essence of the various points being made. This is a film I highly recommend, if only as a way to remind us of our responsibilities as human beings and to keep compassion in our lives.",5,Moving and well done,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,546,"['reading', 'many', 'reviews', 'film', 'definitely', 'wanted', 'see', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'moving', 'story', 'ill-fated', 'timing', 'backlash', 'tragedy', 'America', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'will', 'thousands', 'immigrants', 'who', 'bore', 'brunt', 'profiling', 'just', 'Ibrahim', 'did', 'film', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'captured', 'essence', 'various', 'points', 'being', 'made', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'only', 'way', 'remind', 'responsibilities', 'human', 'beings', 'keep', 'compassion', 'lives']",The Citizen
