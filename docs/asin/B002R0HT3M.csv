1284921,A2V40DTEZLBNKD,B002R0HT3M,Allison Kalman,"[16, 16]","The women of Liberia, in serious of shockingly unknown events, were able to change the face of their nation's government. How? Not with guns. Not with politicians and diplomats. But by employing the ancient Greek techniques of Lysistrata by Aristophanes. Using every technique from sex strikes to striping naked and barricading hallways, the women of Liberia wage a successful campaign to oust their president and resume their country's stalled peace talks.Pray the Devil Back to Hell is sure to inspire anyone who feels they do not have the power to make a change in the world. The women of Liberia united across religious and cultural boundaries in the face of a devastating civil war in order to bring peace to their countries. With these women as examples, no one ever needs to feel they aren't important enough to make a difference. This film has the power to touch hearts and move people to action.Pray the Devil has also spawned the ""Peace is Loud"" campaign, which everyone should check out after watching the film [...]. It's a great way to move from inspiration to action.",5,Grassroots Activism in Action,1257897600,"11 11, 2009",2009,1081,"['women', 'Liberia', 'serious', 'shockingly', 'unknown', 'events', 'were', 'able', 'change', 'face', 'nation', 'government', 'How', 'Not', 'guns', 'Not', 'politicians', 'diplomats', 'employing', 'ancient', 'Greek', 'techniques', 'Lysistrata', 'Aristophanes', 'Using', 'technique', 'sex', 'strikes', 'striping', 'naked', 'barricading', 'hallways', 'women', 'Liberia', 'wage', 'successful', 'campaign', 'oust', 'president', 'resume', 'country', 'stalled', 'peace', 'Devil', 'Back', 'Hell', 'sure', 'inspire', 'anyone', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'power', 'make', 'change', 'world', 'women', 'Liberia', 'united', 'religious', 'cultural', 'boundaries', 'face', 'devastating', 'civil', 'war', 'order', 'bring', 'peace', 'countries', 'women', 'examples', 'one', 'ever', 'feel', 'are', ""n't"", 'important', 'enough', 'make', 'difference', 'film', 'power', 'touch', 'hearts', 'move', 'people', 'action.Pray', 'Devil', 'also', 'spawned', 'Peace', 'Loud', 'campaign', 'everyone', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'watching', 'film', '[', ']', 'great', 'way', 'move', 'inspiration', 'action']",N/A

It just shows how non-violent methods can lead to peace and progression.
