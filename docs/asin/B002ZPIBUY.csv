I had high hopes for ""Pistachio,"" as I do all of them; maybe the fact that Pistachio is my favorite ice cream made me excited for this release.  It's cute, don't get me wrong.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the lesson about obeying your parents, that they want to do what's best for you.  The character names, songs, ducks, Blue Berry (hilarious)...all of that was clever and hilarioous.  However, I just wish they hadn't done a ""Disney"" adaptation.  The reason we won't let our kids watch Pinocchio is because of the fox and carnival scenes.  Of coure, Pistachio isn't even half as bad, but I still didn't like the scheming and lying parts.  yes, kids will have to deal with them someday, but our 2 to 5-year olds don't quite get that there are people like that in the world.  I answer questions for them and we talk about what God wants us to do, that some people care only about money or other things and that we need to pray for them, etc.  Still, though it isn't our favorite Veggie Tales movie (Ballad of Little Joe, Moe and the Big Exit, Noah's Umbrella, Esther, Joshua and the Big Wall...they are our favorites), it teaches an invaluable lesson.  While our kids never choose it out of our collection, it's one I'm happy to put on in the van's DVD player for our 1+ hour trips.  The songs, as always, are catchy and witty.

1314451,A27BMC4GBF8RF5,B002ZPIBUY,Roger C. Delaney,"[1, 2]","Afetr the disappointment that was Abe and the Amazing Promise, I was beginning to become concerned that the creative minds behind Big Idea in its current incarnation (basically, Mike Nawrocki and some hired guns) weren't up to the task of continuing the legacy Phil Vischer and Nawrocki had created.  Thankfully, Pistachio shows there may yet be life left in the franchise.  Surely the best-looking Veggies episode ever in terms of the animation, the story is solid and the jokes are funny and in character for the most part.  Khalil does steal the show, to be sure, but Larry and Bob and Junior are enjoyable as always.  The ""Extreme Re-Do"" gag is clever, especially since it doesn't really change much about the look of the countertop (blue walls and throw pillows), and Qwerty's upgrade seems logical given the technological advances we've seen in the past few years.  Also, it's a relief to see the return of Mike Nawrocki as the co-writer of the latest Silly Song; the last few Silly Songs were fairly weak with the exception of ""Sippy Cup,"" and I was pleased to see Nawrocki returning to arguably what he does best - write Silly Songs (with Kurt Heinecke, who's also back on board for the rest of the music).  All in all, Pistachio teaches a valuable lesson, though I'd argue that the payoff - the moment where Pistachio chooses to listen to his dad instead of insisting on his own way - isn't as strong as it could have been.  Still, I'd guess this one will find its way into our DVD player on a regular basis.

The animation was top-notch, the humor was better then usual (I laughed out-loud many times) and the lesson was excellent for children. The importants of listening to wise parents and in this case a father in a child's life. The retelling of Pinocchio was a great storyline for the Big Idea group and they didn't disappoint with a very clever rendition. I liked how they skirted around the whole fairy thing with Madame Blueberry. Very cute. Kahlil (the caterpillar named Cricket) steals the show with his humor and loyalty. The Silly Songs With Larry was a good one with the Office Supply song done as a obscure Broadway musical. Qwerty gets an upgrade but Bob still rolls his eyes.My four year old loved the entire DVD.
