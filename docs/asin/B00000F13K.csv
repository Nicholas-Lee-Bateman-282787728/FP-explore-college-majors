496544,A3PFKE8EFXAXQE,B00000F13K,"cornbreadthedog ""larue""","[0, 0]","One of the coolest things about the internet, that I'm continually discovering, is that you get the chance to check out movies that you might have missed out on or maybe even passed over the first time around.Barely do I even remember the trailer of Club Paradise back in 1986, but because of Robin Williams and Adolph Cesar (who gave a truly outstanding and forever hauntingly Oscar worthy performance in A SOLDIER'S STORY), I bought this movie off of Amazon.com for like under 8 bucks or so with shipping.I must say that this is the most enjoyable 8 bucks I've spent in a while...(and this is coming from a guy whose hemorrhaged thousands of dollars on child support payments)!However, I did noticed that Robin Williams is kind of laid back this time around and has a soft kind of subtle charm in this movie but it still doesn't stop Williams from delivering some of the funniest one-liners that I've ever heard. What's really special, for me, about this film is that it's one of the last performances from the undeniably and extremely talented, Mr. Adolph Cesar(Mr. Gundy), who sadly passed away before this funny film even premiered in the theaters.Without a doubt, though, Club Paradise has got a  bunch of laugh out loud moments going for it! Sure, it could've been better and was a little slow in a few parts while the next joke or visual gag was making it's way around the corner of the silver screen, but I'll keep pulling this one out from my DVD collection  from time to time because I love laughter and I'm a still a little kid at heart  from the 1980's.Oh, yeah!..Club Paradise most definitely has earned it's place in my collection of DVD movies!...",4,CLUB PARADISE HAS GOT A LOT OF LAUGHS GOING FOR IT!

496549,A3NV0G16V04FYM,B00000F13K,"Jack Baker ""Beauty Will Save the World""","[0, 0]","This is possibly the best Robin Williams comedy out there.  Highly underrated, this movie boasts a solid performance from Williams before he became the whirlwind ad-libber and ball of energy he's been in his last several movies.  He's much more in control here and that's a good thing.  The jokes are funnier and not as machine-gun like in their frequency.  He gives a wry, smart-alecky performance as Jack Moniker, a retired firefighter who buys into a friend's island club, only to find that there are people (big business) who want the property for their own devices.  He has to deal with that along with the pitfalls of running the club and dealing with the wackos who have come to vacation there.  The supporting cast is excellent, with Rick Moranis and Eugene Levy as a pair of stoner would be lotharios, Brian Doyle-Murray as a sleazy rival hotel owner, Twiggy as the sexy love interest, and Peter O'Toole turns in a fine performance playing the English governor of the island of St. Nicholas.  Jimmy Cliff is a comic revelation as Ernest Reed, the owner and chief performer at Club Paradise. His deadpan humor compliments Williams's character perfectly and we also see his angry political side when the developers try to force him to sell his club.  He gives an honest, believable performance, the strongest of the movie.  He also lends his music to an excellent soundtrack, sadly unavailable on CD, which makes the movie all the more enjoyable.  If you're looking for a serious, deep movie, you've come to the wrong place.  If you're looking to spend an hour or so with some wacky characters, plus the world's most enormous bag of weed, then Club Paradise is the place for you.",4,"No Man is An Island, Jack",1200873600,"01 21, 2008",2008,1686,"['possibly', 'best', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'comedy', 'there', 'Highly', 'underrated', 'movie', 'solid', 'performance', 'Williams', 'became', 'whirlwind', 'ad-libber', 'ball', 'energy', 'been', 'last', 'several', 'movies', 'much', 'more', 'control', 'here', 'good', 'thing', 'jokes', 'are', 'funnier', 'not', 'machine-gun', 'frequency', 'wry', 'smart-alecky', 'performance', 'Jack', 'Moniker', 'retired', 'firefighter', 'who', 'friend', 'island', 'club', 'only', 'find', 'are', 'people', 'big', 'business', 'who', 'want', 'property', 'own', 'devices', 'deal', 'pitfalls', 'running', 'club', 'dealing', 'wackos', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'vacation', 'there', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Rick', 'Moranis', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'pair', 'stoner', 'would', 'be', 'lotharios', 'Brian', 'Doyle-Murray', 'sleazy', 'rival', 'hotel', 'owner', 'Twiggy', 'sexy', 'love', 'interest', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'fine', 'performance', 'playing', 'English', 'governor', 'island', 'St.', 'Nicholas', 'Jimmy', 'Cliff', 'comic', 'revelation', 'Ernest', 'Reed', 'owner', 'chief', 'performer', 'Club', 'Paradise', 'deadpan', 'humor', 'compliments', 'Williams', 'character', 'perfectly', 'also', 'see', 'angry', 'political', 'side', 'when', 'developers', 'try', 'force', 'sell', 'club', 'honest', 'believable', 'performance', 'strongest', 'movie', 'also', 'music', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'sadly', 'unavailable', 'CD', 'movie', 'more', 'enjoyable', ""'re"", 'looking', 'serious', 'deep', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'come', 'wrong', 'place', ""'re"", 'looking', 'spend', 'hour', 'so', 'wacky', 'characters', 'world', 'most', 'enormous', 'bag', 'weed', 'then', 'Club', 'Paradise', 'place']",N/A

It is a silly comedy with some great comedic talents from the Second City troupe.  The combination of Rick Moranis and Eugene Levy is hilarious as Barry and Barry, the desperate friends trying to find women who are even remotely attracted to them at the resort.  They have some of the best lines.  Andrea Martin is also extremely funny, and I can't help but laugh at her doing the limbo and trying to belt out soulful reggae while half drunk.  Robin Williams has a more laid back routine in this movie, which is rare for a comedian that can't seem to have a sane conversation when he gives interviews.  He is the main character and leaves more of the antics to the supporting cast, but he does a nice job.  As others have said, the music in the movie is excellent and Jimmy Cliff provides a great soundtrack, supplemented by one great reggae cover by the Kinks, ""Apeman"", which I have since tried to find.It's worth checking out for a good laugh.
