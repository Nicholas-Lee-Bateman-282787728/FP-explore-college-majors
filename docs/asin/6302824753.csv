Acting was quite different back then.  That's why these great people of the past are coined ""masters"" and most of todays fluff and sludge should take a lesson.

I don't know if she won any awards, but she should have.  Lloyd Bridges, in his prime body, was also good as her 2nd husband who couldn't cope with her illness.  This must of be one of first movies to try to deal with this very sad and frustrating disease.  Kim Stanley was wonderful in this difficult role.  Very well done.

It's not camp enough to be funny, not good enough to be a drama, and unable to be an exploration of a  Marilyn Monroe type, since it was made before Marilyn began to disrupt  productions with her psychiatric problems. However it still has a strange  claustrophobic fascination. I particularly like the scenes with Kim Stanley  and Lloyd Bridges, set in huge rooms, with no dialogue and lots of walking  around. The boomerang line &quot;I can still turn a head&quot; made me  remember I had seen the film before, though I had assumed it had come from  something more like Imitation of Life.  Kim is dressed and styled to  resemble Marilyn, but her manner makes her seem older than her age. Her  Method line readings work against her being a Marilyn, and she really isn't  believable as the tramp she keeps telling us she is supposed to be.  An  ironic touch is Kim's later role as the mother of Frances Farmer,  considering all her talk of being insane here.",3,Odd,960681600,"06 11, 2000",2000,1080,"['film', 'left', 'dumbfounded', 'no-one', 'had', 'worked', 'out', 'what', 'genre', 'was', 'being', 'attempted', 'tone', 'place', 'not', 'camp', 'enough', 'be', 'funny', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'drama', 'unable', 'be', 'exploration', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'type', 'was', 'made', 'Marilyn', 'began', 'disrupt', 'productions', 'psychiatric', 'problems', 'However', 'still', 'strange', 'claustrophobic', 'fascination', 'particularly', 'scenes', 'Kim', 'Stanley', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'set', 'huge', 'rooms', 'dialogue', 'lots', 'walking', 'around', 'boomerang', 'line', 'quot', 'can', 'still', 'turn', 'head', 'quot', 'made', 'remember', 'had', 'seen', 'film', 'had', 'assumed', 'had', 'come', 'something', 'more', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'Kim', 'dressed', 'styled', 'resemble', 'Marilyn', 'manner', 'seem', 'older', 'age', 'Method', 'line', 'readings', 'work', 'being', 'Marilyn', 'really', ""n't"", 'believable', 'tramp', 'telling', 'supposed', 'be', 'ironic', 'touch', 'Kim', 'later', 'role', 'mother', 'Frances', 'Farmer', 'considering', 'talk', 'being', 'insane', 'here']",N/A
339969,A8JAMHAIU9YUD,6302824753,Sebastian Daniel,"[0, 0]","The Goddess is interesting because of Kim Stanley and a few Actors Studio actors really acting.  Oh my, how some of them ACT.  The script is heavy-handed(one could actually be injured by it).  It had been rumored to be the life of Marilyn Monroe, but that doesn't help.  It's hard getting through it.  Stanley looks forty and plays seventeen--opposite actors almost seventeen.  Not a wise move.  This is strictly for the strong who want an example of Stanley's work; she was a terrific actress, and we're lucky to have this.  You should see it, at least once.  Also in the cast: Elizabeth Wilson(always good), Joyce Van Patten, Joan Copeland and Patty Duke.
