1185395,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B001EAWMP6,D. Hartley,"[16, 18]","I had just about abandoned all hope that this marvelous 1978 sleeper from Australian writer-director Fred Schepisi would ever see the light of day on DVD, until I was pleasantly surprised to see it pop up on the ""new release"" rack of my favorite neighborhood independent video store last month (I quickly snapped up the last copy). Adapted from Thomas Keneally's novel (which was inspired by true events) this semi-epic culture-clash tale concerns the travails of the title character, played with explosive intensity by non-professional actor Tommy Lewis. Jimmie is a half-caste Aboriginal, living in New South Wales in 1900. He struggles between the pull of his native culture and the insistence of white sponsors who want him to ""do the right thing"" and assimilate into ""civilized"" society. This is easier said than done; it seems that the harder he tries to please everyone, the more he is shunned by all. Jimmie sublimates his reaction to the enveloping systemic racism and roiling inner conflicts for too long, which eventually leads to a shocking explosion of violence. This is visceral, powerful and disturbing stuff (not for the squeamish), but well worth your time. The film makes an excellent companion piece to the more recent Rabbit-Proof Fence. The DVD includes a recent interview with Lewis.",5,"Baz Luhrmann's ""Australia""....NOT!",1229904000,"12 22, 2008",2008,1305,"['had', 'just', 'about', 'abandoned', 'hope', 'marvelous', '1978', 'sleeper', 'Australian', 'writer-director', 'Fred', 'Schepisi', 'would', 'ever', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'DVD', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'see', 'pop', 'up', 'new', 'release', 'rack', 'favorite', 'neighborhood', 'independent', 'video', 'store', 'last', 'month', 'quickly', 'snapped', 'up', 'last', 'copy', 'Adapted', 'Thomas', 'Keneally', 'novel', 'was', 'inspired', 'true', 'events', 'semi-epic', 'culture-clash', 'tale', 'concerns', 'travails', 'title', 'character', 'played', 'explosive', 'intensity', 'non-professional', 'actor', 'Tommy', 'Lewis', 'Jimmie', 'half-caste', 'Aboriginal', 'living', 'New', 'South', 'Wales', '1900', 'pull', 'native', 'culture', 'insistence', 'white', 'sponsors', 'who', 'want', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'assimilate', 'civilized', 'society', 'easier', 'said', 'done', 'harder', 'please', 'everyone', 'more', 'shunned', 'Jimmie', 'reaction', 'enveloping', 'systemic', 'racism', 'roiling', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'too', 'long', 'eventually', 'shocking', 'explosion', 'violence', 'visceral', 'powerful', 'disturbing', 'stuff', 'not', 'squeamish', 'well', 'time', 'film', 'excellent', 'companion', 'piece', 'more', 'recent', 'Rabbit-Proof', 'Fence', 'DVD', 'recent', 'interview', 'Lewis']",Chant Of Jimmie Blacksmith

It had a huge impact on me and was the movie I thought about when I was looking at the preview of the Olympics to be held in Australia. When they featured the Aborigines playing their instruments as a positive part of Australia the disrespect of how the Aborigines came to my mind.  I realize that things may be different in Australia now and this chapter of their history may be only a part of their past but as an African American I double that.

1185398,A2R1GFS6P1PC18,B001EAWMP6,Peter Baklava,"[1, 1]","""Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith"" is a notable film for its portrayal of a potentially good individual who is driven to become a renegade because of the way racism creates a cage around his existence.  Based on the true case of a man, half-Aborigine and half white, named Jimmy Governor---this film made quite a splash in 1978, but has become unjustly neglected in the time since.""Jimmie"" is portrayed by a novice actor named Tommy Lewis, who does a good job conveying the character's nave sweetness and inability to understand and cope with the white society that he wants acceptance from.Despite the harshness of the subject, the film is very beautifully shot, and has to be one of the prettiest of all Australian movies.  Any American watching the movie will see obvious parallels to the treatment and isolation of American Indians.  But unlike a Hollywood Charles Bronson vehicle, this is not an over-the-top, half-breed revenge flick.  It's a more subtle study of how mistreatment causes one individual to go over the edge.  In spirit, the film might have more in common with ""Badlands"", the Martin Sheen movie, than it does with Bronson's ""Chato's Land"".  Jimmie Blacksmith ""declares war"" on white society after he experiences repeated slights and condescension--in fact, a kind of nullification, from the entitled whites.  He doesn't understand the unwritten codes.  ""They expect us to (mess up)"", he rants to his half-brother.  But his rebellion is the act of a loner, and even his brother deserts him in the end.The movie is also memorable for a good performance from Angela Punch McGregor--then known simply as Angela Punch---and an early appearance by actor Bryan Brown.The source material is a novel by Thomas Keneally, who also wrote ""Schindler's List.""",4,Worth Revisiting,1401494400,"05 31, 2014",2014,1761,"['Chant', 'Jimmie', 'Blacksmith', 'notable', 'film', 'portrayal', 'potentially', 'good', 'individual', 'who', 'driven', 'become', 'renegade', 'way', 'racism', 'cage', 'existence', 'Based', 'true', 'case', 'man', 'half-Aborigine', 'half', 'white', 'named', 'Jimmy', 'Governor', '-this', 'film', 'made', 'quite', 'splash', '1978', 'become', 'unjustly', 'neglected', 'time', 'Jimmie', 'portrayed', 'novice', 'actor', 'named', 'Tommy', 'Lewis', 'who', 'good', 'job', 'conveying', 'character', 'nave', 'sweetness', 'inability', 'understand', 'cope', 'white', 'society', 'acceptance', 'from.Despite', 'harshness', 'subject', 'film', 'very', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'be', 'one', 'prettiest', 'Australian', 'movies', 'Any', 'American', 'watching', 'movie', 'will', 'see', 'obvious', 'parallels', 'treatment', 'isolation', 'American', 'Indians', 'Hollywood', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'vehicle', 'not', 'over-the-top', 'half-breed', 'revenge', 'flick', 'more', 'subtle', 'study', 'how', 'mistreatment', 'one', 'individual', 'go', 'edge', 'spirit', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'more', 'common', 'Badlands', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'movie', 'Bronson', 'Chato', 'Land', 'Jimmie', 'Blacksmith', 'war', 'white', 'society', 'repeated', 'slights', 'condescension', 'fact', 'kind', 'nullification', 'entitled', 'whites', ""n't"", 'understand', 'unwritten', 'codes', 'expect', 'mess', 'up', 'half-brother', 'rebellion', 'act', 'loner', 'even', 'brother', 'end.The', 'movie', 'also', 'memorable', 'good', 'performance', 'Angela', 'Punch', 'McGregor', 'then', 'known', 'simply', 'Angela', 'Punch', '-and', 'early', 'appearance', 'actor', 'Bryan', 'Brown.The', 'source', 'material', 'novel', 'Thomas', 'Keneally', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'Schindler', 'List']",Chant Of Jimmie Blacksmith
