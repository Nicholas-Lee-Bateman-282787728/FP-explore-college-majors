36118,A2SP2LGE4NCYMR,0780628551,"Arne Andersen ""Arne Blaze""","[1, 2]","THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE is quite polished and well made.  However, it fails to interest, excite or satisfy for a number of reasons.First, it is a blatant update of a classic thriller, ROSEMARY'S BABY, so lacks any sort of suspense.  We know where the plot is going. Second, we only have one scene with Depp's character before his outer space experience, so are unable to notice the subtle changes that occur after this event; therefore, we are unable to be drawn into the film's premise and the heroine's predicament. This is the fault of the screenplay.  Third, the title - this has to be one of the weakest titles ever to come out of Hollywood, a title that promises nothing interesting and at least does deliver in that one aspect.  ENEMY WITHIN, LOST ENCOUNTER, ALIEN HUSBAND - yes, terrible all, but better than the bland THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE.The cinematography is impressive - dark but well lit.  The editing effects are top notch.  The musical score is properly menacing and edgy.  Theron seems to be on medication through much of her performance - there is no registration of apprehension, processing of the pieces that don't fit, fear, mistrust, and ultimate terror.  If we didn't know that this was going the way of ROSEMARY'S BABY, and with our knowledge of her character's breakdown and hallucinations at her recent parents' deaths, we'd wonder if this was really happening to her or whether she was imaginging it - this could have made a similar film subject edgier.Depp plays a villain - a suave villain.  He is given light brown hair with blonde highlights, he adopts a good old boy Texas accent and is properly solicitous and controlling in the role of the possessed husband. His character is written and directed one dimensionally, so he is not really allowed to shine. The script is slanted toward Theron's character as the lead with Depp in strong support, rather than co-lead.One must applaud the brief supporting performance of the ever wonderful Donna Murphy (two time Tony winner) as the other wife.  She is vivid and unforgettable.  When she is on screen with Theron, you can't watch Theron. You're riveted on Murphy-she commands the screen.To sum up the film, it's beautiful to look at, but unremarkable, uninteresting and tepid.

Compared to this film, I highly recommend Rosemary's Baby. I enjoyed Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron's performances. Forget the story. These two people drive the movie. These two very beautiful people.Spencer (Depp) is an astronaut. His wife, Jillian, (Theron) is a loving wife and second grade teacher. They are the epitome of all-Americans.

What happened in those two minutes? Jillian begins to worry. He won't talk about it. His flight partner died afterward because of it, and the guy's wife killed herself. When Jillian becomes pregnant with twins, she learns that the other wife was also pregnant with twins when she killed herself. Odd. Jillian digs deeper into this mystery until she uncovers a horror that she never imagined.The ending. Nope. Didn't like it. Didn't like the end of Rosemary's Baby either. No vindication! Not for Rosemary or for Jillian! What happens to Jillian makes me even madder, though. See for yourself. I hope none of you watch it and say, ""Oh, how poignant."" Ick!!

The cake in this case is the plot, We're-being-invaded-by-aliens-and-nobody-believes-me.  The plot in TAW is also a direct rip-off of SPECIES 2, a very bad movie.  But at least SPECIES 2 had a few good special effects going for it. TAW has nothing.This is so bad it does not even belong in the elite category of &quot;so bad it's good&quot;.  When those movies try to be serious, it's funny.  Sometimes excrutiatingly funny.  But with TAW, it's painful. EXCRUTIATINGLY painful.And one more crime it commits (I could go on all day) is that it tries to appeal to science fiction/horror audiences.  TAW is neither science fiction or horror.  The closest thing I can compare it to are those daytime soap operas that try adding supernatural elements to the storylines when the writers run out of ideas.  Only they stretched this soap opera out a half an hour longer and infused it with a lot less imagination.So if you are a video store wanting to rent or buy something original, then check out just about anything else except for this stinker.  But if you want to witness something truly unoriginal, poorly acted, and just plain bad, then check out TAW.

36130,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,0780628551,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[19, 21]","But it turns out it's just as cold and creepy on Earth, and cold is just how this chilly little Something-in-Outer-space-got-my-Astronaut-Husband flick serves it up. ""The Astronaut's Wife"" is a stylish, nastily clever, absolutely heartless, efficiently paced and admirably designed little gem of a horror movie, centering on the crux of everyone's worst fears: what if the love of my life is a ghoulish space alien who plans on destroying Earth?When I was a little kid, I remember being scared silly by tales of outer space terror and body-snatching on those creepy ""Outer Limits"" and ""The Twilight Zone"" episodes. Everyone has seen at least one variation on the theme: the noble, heroic astronaut with the jutting jaw and confident swagger goes off on the Antares IV Expedition/Rocket Shoot to Planet X/Mission to the Moon, but when he comes back he's no longer himself. He's one of Them---a leering, skulking, alien horror, waiting to turn the tables on his unwitting friends, relatives, and fellow NASA employees.That's what ""The Astronaut's Wife"" feels like to me: a really creepy ""Outer Limits"" episode with a decent budget, plus Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron. Johnny Depp is perfect as the swaggering Commander Spencer Armacost, who goes up on a routine near-Earth orbit mission with his partner (played admirably by Nick Cassavetes---see, ""Astronaut's Wife"" is just one degree of separation from ""Rosemary's Baby"" after all!) one tragic day.There is a mysterious and inexplicable electrical surge, the mission is aborted, and Armacost goes from doting husband to skulking, leering creep in one fell swoop.He acquires some interesting new habits as well, like spending quality time with the family radio. He also gets a gig as a consultant for a secret weapons lab (run by the original serial killing 'Tooth Fairy' from ""Manhunter"", the creepy Tom Noonan).Charlize Theron turns in a sympathetic performance as a wife who---well, dang it, she likes the high society and the big bucks just fine, but she wishes Johnny Depp would spend less time with the radio and a little more time with her.Her suspicions mount when a former NASA employee (the great Joe Morton doing his nervous-tic-eye-twitching paranoid thang here)tries frantically to meet with her and communicate his worst fears (that possibly her husband's quality time with the radio has something to do with the fact that he may, in fact, be a Space Alien)and the movie spends most of the rest of its time with Theron in a cat and mouse game with Depp, who, when he's not cozying up to the radio, is skulking around the house switching off lights and doing horrible things to Theron's sister (played by the always resourcefully creepy Clea Duvall). Director Rand Ravitch employs a steady hand and brings things to a boil---all cold, sleek, and subtle.If you got creeped out by the old ""Outer Limits"" shows, you'll love it.JSG",5,Mars ain't the kind of Place to raise a Kid...,1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,2891,"['out', 'just', 'cold', 'creepy', 'Earth', 'cold', 'just', 'how', 'chilly', 'little', 'Something-in-Outer-space-got-my-Astronaut-Husband', 'flick', 'up', 'Astronaut', 'Wife', 'stylish', 'nastily', 'clever', 'absolutely', 'heartless', 'efficiently', 'paced', 'admirably', 'designed', 'little', 'gem', 'horror', 'movie', 'centering', 'crux', 'everyone', 'worst', 'fears', 'what', 'love', 'life', 'ghoulish', 'space', 'alien', 'who', 'destroying', 'Earth', 'When', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'remember', 'being', 'scared', 'silly', 'tales', 'outer', 'space', 'terror', 'body-snatching', 'creepy', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episodes', 'Everyone', 'seen', 'least', 'one', 'variation', 'theme', 'noble', 'heroic', 'astronaut', 'jutting', 'jaw', 'confident', 'swagger', 'Antares', 'IV', 'Expedition/Rocket', 'Shoot', 'Planet', 'X/Mission', 'Moon', 'when', 'back', 'no', 'longer', 'one', 'Them', '-a', 'leering', 'skulking', 'alien', 'horror', 'waiting', 'turn', 'tables', 'unwitting', 'friends', 'relatives', 'fellow', 'NASA', 'employees.That', 'what', 'Astronaut', 'Wife', 'feels', 'really', 'creepy', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'episode', 'decent', 'budget', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'perfect', 'swaggering', 'Commander', 'Spencer', 'Armacost', 'who', 'up', 'routine', 'near-Earth', 'orbit', 'mission', 'partner', 'played', 'admirably', 'Nick', 'Cassavetes', '-see', 'Astronaut', 'Wife', 'just', 'one', 'degree', 'separation', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'one', 'tragic', 'mysterious', 'inexplicable', 'electrical', 'surge', 'mission', 'aborted', 'Armacost', 'doting', 'husband', 'skulking', 'leering', 'creep', 'one', 'fell', 'swoop.He', 'interesting', 'new', 'habits', 'as', 'well', 'spending', 'quality', 'time', 'family', 'radio', 'also', 'gig', 'consultant', 'secret', 'weapons', 'lab', 'run', 'original', 'serial', 'killing', 'Fairy', 'Manhunter', 'creepy', 'Tom', 'Noonan', '.Charlize', 'Theron', 'sympathetic', 'performance', 'wife', 'who', '-well', 'dang', 'high', 'society', 'big', 'bucks', 'just', 'fine', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'would', 'spend', 'less', 'time', 'radio', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'her.Her', 'suspicions', 'mount', 'when', 'former', 'NASA', 'employee', 'great', 'Joe', 'Morton', 'doing', 'nervous-tic-eye-twitching', 'paranoid', 'thang', 'here', 'frantically', 'meet', 'communicate', 'worst', 'fears', 'possibly', 'husband', 'quality', 'time', 'radio', 'something', 'do', 'fact', 'may', 'fact', 'be', 'Space', 'Alien', 'movie', 'most', 'rest', 'time', 'Theron', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'Depp', 'who', 'when', 'not', 'cozying', 'up', 'radio', 'skulking', 'house', 'switching', 'off', 'lights', 'doing', 'horrible', 'things', 'Theron', 'sister', 'played', 'always', 'resourcefully', 'creepy', 'Clea', 'Duvall', 'Director', 'Rand', 'Ravitch', 'steady', 'hand', 'things', 'boil', '-all', 'cold', 'sleek', 'subtle.If', 'got', 'creeped', 'out', 'old', 'Outer', 'Limits', ""'ll"", 'love', 'it.JSG']",N/A

36140,A35AMPDFAB8JLT,0780628551,Edmonson,"[0, 0]","""The Astronaut's Wife"" (1999) is directed by Rand Ravich. The beginning of the film is reminiscent of the 1955 sci-fi horror film ""The Creeping Unknown"" as the astronauts encounter an alien entity in space which possesses them. Like other alien possession films part of the drama is about how the host changes his identity and how those around them gradually realize that the person they thought they knew is no longer that person. In this film Johnny Depp is the astronaut (Spencer) who returns to earth and his wife (Jillian)is played by Charlize Theron. This well acted and directed psychological horror film draws us into the hell Jillian discovers as the world she knew is turned upside down. Some other films with related themes include ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""The Stepford Wifes"", ""I Married a Monster From Outer Space"", and ""Rosemary's Baby"".There was an alternate ""positive"" ending filmed but it doesn't appear on this DVD. This DVD also doesn't have any extras except for film biographies. I was hoping to get this film on blu-ray, but since it isn't currently available in that format I purchased the DVD and I was pleasantly surprised with the quality.

36144,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0780628551,"""flickjunkie""","[2, 5]","I rented this film without much in the way of expectations.  I am not a big sci-fi fan and even less of a horror fan, I was prepared to be  underwhelmed.  In fact, I was extremely impressed, not with the story, but  with the filmmaking, particularly the direction by Rand Ravich.The story  was a patchwork of a lot of different worn out sci-fi themes.  There was  the &quot;alien takes over the human&quot; theme, the &quot;alien dwells  among us&quot; theme and of course, &quot;the evil baby gestating in the  good and pure mother&quot; theme.  Suffice it to say that this wasn't fresh  material.  But let's be honest.  How many stories are really fresh  material?  Why are we suckers for the same old romantic comedy storylines  again and again and yet we expect that sci-fi must be completely novel to  be good?What is outstanding about this film is the suspense.  I haven't  seen a film that was so effective as a suspense film in quite some time.  It was effective because of daring use of the camera by Ravich that  visually left me begging for relief in scene after scene.  Actually, if  there is any criticism of this film it is the fact that the suspense was  too well done.  It wears the viewer out without sufficient mental rest  stops.Ravich's use of extreme close ups, wide angle shots, rapid camera  movements, odd perspectives, and tight sets produces a sense of relentless  suspense that made me want jump into the screen and yell at the characters.  For some, this was probably overwhelming and tedious.  It seems that  viewers today want pace, novelty and surprises.  Yes, we knew Spencer  (Johnny Depp) was now an alien.  Yes, we knew that Jillian (Charlize  Theron) had alien babies growing inside her.  What we didn't know was what  she was going to do about it and what he was going to do about her.  So I  thought the story was ultimately effective in achieving its  goal...thrilling suspense.What this film lacked was a hideous monster  and a lot of blood and gore.  This is why it wasn't popular in my opinion  because these are staples of today's mass market viewer.  This is the very  reason I thought it was excellent because it produced fear and  anticipation, not by what was seen, but by what was unseen.From an  acting perspective, this was a shining moment for Charlize Theron.  This  was a very demanding film for a female lead and she handled it like a pro.  Her part demanded a full range of emotions from sweet adoring wife to the  terror of a caged animal and she delivered the most complete performance  I've seen from her to date.  As a matter of fact, Theron so controlled the  screen that Johnny Depp didn't really have much to do except give the  occasional menacing look.I'm going to buck the tide with this one and  give it an 8/10.  This film was about style.  It failed to deliver the  obvious and this elusiveness made it unique among all the weird science  fiction rip-them-to-shreds hack movies that jam the video store shelves.  And that's what I liked most about it.",4,Expertly crafted suspense thriller,962323200,"06 30, 2000",2000,3019,"['rented', 'film', 'much', 'way', 'expectations', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'even', 'less', 'horror', 'fan', 'was', 'prepared', 'be', 'underwhelmed', 'fact', 'was', 'extremely', 'impressed', 'not', 'story', 'filmmaking', 'particularly', 'direction', 'Rand', 'Ravich.The', 'story', 'was', 'patchwork', 'lot', 'different', 'worn', 'out', 'sci-fi', 'themes', 'was', 'quot', 'alien', 'human', 'quot', 'theme', 'quot', 'alien', 'dwells', 'quot', 'theme', 'course', 'quot', 'evil', 'baby', 'gestating', 'good', 'pure', 'mother', 'quot', 'theme', 'Suffice', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'fresh', 'material', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'How', 'many', 'stories', 'are', 'really', 'fresh', 'material', 'Why', 'are', 'suckers', 'same', 'old', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'storylines', 'again', 'again', 'yet', 'expect', 'sci-fi', 'must', 'be', 'completely', 'novel', 'be', 'good', 'What', 'outstanding', 'film', 'suspense', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'effective', 'suspense', 'film', 'quite', 'time', 'was', 'effective', 'daring', 'use', 'camera', 'Ravich', 'visually', 'left', 'begging', 'relief', 'scene', 'scene', 'Actually', 'criticism', 'film', 'fact', 'suspense', 'was', 'too', 'well', 'done', 'viewer', 'sufficient', 'mental', 'rest', 'stops.Ravich', 'use', 'extreme', 'close', 'ups', 'wide', 'angle', 'shots', 'rapid', 'camera', 'movements', 'odd', 'perspectives', 'tight', 'sets', 'sense', 'relentless', 'suspense', 'made', 'want', 'jump', 'screen', 'yell', 'characters', 'was', 'probably', 'overwhelming', 'tedious', 'viewers', 'today', 'want', 'pace', 'novelty', 'surprises', 'Yes', 'knew', 'Spencer', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'was', 'now', 'alien', 'Yes', 'knew', 'Jillian', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'had', 'alien', 'babies', 'growing', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'do', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'do', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'ultimately', 'effective', 'achieving', 'goal', 'thrilling', 'suspense.What', 'film', 'lacked', 'was', 'hideous', 'monster', 'lot', 'blood', 'gore', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'popular', 'opinion', 'are', 'staples', 'today', 'mass', 'market', 'viewer', 'very', 'reason', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', 'produced', 'fear', 'anticipation', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'seen', 'what', 'was', 'unseen.From', 'acting', 'perspective', 'was', 'shining', 'moment', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'was', 'very', 'demanding', 'film', 'female', 'lead', 'handled', 'pro', 'part', 'demanded', 'full', 'range', 'emotions', 'sweet', 'adoring', 'wife', 'terror', 'caged', 'animal', 'delivered', 'most', 'complete', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'date', 'matter', 'fact', 'Theron', 'so', 'controlled', 'screen', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'do', 'give', 'occasional', 'menacing', 'look.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'buck', 'tide', 'one', 'give', '8/10', 'film', 'was', 'style', 'failed', 'deliver', 'obvious', 'elusiveness', 'made', 'unique', 'weird', 'science', 'fiction', 'rip-them-to-shreds', 'hack', 'movies', 'jam', 'video', 'store', 'shelves', 'what', 'liked', 'most']",N/A

You know my theory about how only the first 2/3rds of a movie are interesting? This film runs with that. It is all about tension and atmosphere, so lay back and enjoy that, because there is NO PAYOFF WHATSOEVER. You never find out what the aliens are really up to, no one wins in the end, nothing is resolved. You have to be prepared for the fact that the build-up and tension IS the movie.This movie has some very creepy and unnerving scenes, which I would say were similar to the tone of the first 3/4 of The Sixth Sense. With this movie you have to be prepared to follow the subtle changes in tone and atmosphere, and just go where they take you. I found the entire sequence where Charlize Theron initially finds out that something has happened on the shuttle to be very creepy. In fact much of the movie is very unnerving and slightly surreal, exploring the more sinister aspects of the idea that someone's DNA has merged with yours and now there's some new organism growing in your body.I basically went to see this because I like Johnny Depp and thought [this is pre-Secret Window] that he wouldn't purposely do a movie that was just stupid. His performance is very convincing, as usual. He's very cocky and sexy toward the beginning, in particular. I also think Charlize Theron is a VERY good actress [and this was pre-Monster], and she proves that again here. Yes, this is another version of the role she played in Devil's Advocate, but I suspect that the director saw how good she was in that and wanted her to essentially redo it for this. I think people who don't respect her acting are speaking out of the sexist idea that a woman who is that beautiful cannot possibly be talented.If you like very carefully controlled tension and great horror atmospherics, I would suggest you see this film.

Unfortunately the viewer's not stop attention was caused by confusion and a constant search for answers that are never totally revealed.  The screenplay needs more development and editing. As a avid sci-fi fan, I was very disappointed with what could have been a great movie with newness in plot and very good actors.The blame should be placed with the screen play writer who failed miserably in plot development, the editing, and the audio engineer.The plot development could have been much enhanced with more information surrounding the character Sherman Reese. Why was he fired?  What did he know? How deep was the NASA coverup and why?The briefcase contents could have been much more effective with more revelation of the contents than only the VHS tape. Mr.Reese obviously made the tape in case of his death, so why did he want to share the contents with Jillian prior to his meeting Spenser at the subway exit? The dream sequences could also have been better developed to aid plot cohesion. While riding in the taxi, what did Jillian see coming down a building's stairs?  Even viewing in frame by frame mode, it was unclear to me.  These are just some examples of poor congruency and unclear development.  The ending left the viewer empty and unfullfilled in their quest for answers and with a feeling of being setup for a sequal.Technically, especially with 5.1 surround systems, the sound levels were from extreme soft to very loud. This viewer got so tired of adjusting the volume level, he finally set volume control level much lower than usual and used closed captioning to aid comprehension of the soft conversations.In conclusion, this sci-fi maven was very disappointed because TAW was fresh, full of possibilities, and could have been just plain excellent.

I think the worst thing about this film is the fact that it makes a comparison to Rosemary's Baby on the box.  Because of that, I went in with a preconcieved notion of  what was going to happen.  The comparison is not fair.  Rosemary's Baby was  a great film, but this movie can stand on it's own without people trying to  fool us into thinking that it is a remake of &quot;Baby.&quot;I am a big  fan of Johnny Depp and I think that he brings a touch of class to all of  his films.  This one is no exception.  Charlize Theron is the persona of  every boy's dream elementary school teacher.  Both give good performances.  Unfortunatley, Johnny's biggest role is to try not to say anything.  I  think that Johnny shows us a different kind of character here than he has  before and if you are a fan of his, it might be worth checking out.To  wrap it up, I think that any science fiction fan would enjoy this film at  least for one watch.  It's easy on the special effects but heavy on the  suspense.  Some sceens were done very well, with a real artistic flair.  Don't read the box before you watch it.

A movie that wastes no time jumping right into the ""action"" of the plot, but then feels drawn out in the middle-section.Academy Award-nominee Johnny Depp (Best Actor,Finding Neverland (Widescreen Edition)) stars as Spencer Armacost and Academy Award-winner Charlize Theron (Best Actress,Monster)As his wife Jillian Armacost. Spencer is an astronaut...I know you hadn't already guessed this, so I thought I'd let you know. Within minutes of the start time, Spencer and his fellow astronaut Alex Streck (Nick Cassavettes, the director ofThe Notebook (New Line Platinum Series)) are blasted off into space. Minutes after that, Jillian is contacted by NASA and informed that they have lost contact with Spencer for two minutes. Both Spencer and Alex return to Earth fine....But, within minutes, Alex has died of an apparent stroke and his wife has committed suicide. Taking no time to grieve, Spencer resigns from NASA and accepts an executive job with an aerospace firm. Spencer and Jillian relocate to New York and Jillian becomes pregnant with twins. Soon, a former NASA employee tracks down Jillian convinced that what happened to Spencer during those two minutes was something supernatural...Extraterrestrial even.I doubt you'll even care when the film reaches this point. An hour into The Astronaut's Wife, I didn't care about the characters or what was going to happen to them. I didn't care what happened to Spencer during those two minutes. The script and these characters give you nothing to care about.It's a film that seems to suspect its audience is a bunch of idiots. It explains things we already know and toys us with the notion that Spencer may be an alien, which we already guessed.Furthermore, it's billed as a ""thriller,"" when there's nothing thrilling about it. There's nothing ominous or menacing about it, despite how hard it tries to be both of these things. Worse, its got a dramatic musical score that attempts to create false tension, including the clich&eacute;d LOUD MUSIC cue when a character opens a refrigerator to find another character standing behind it.It is filled with ridiculous, textbook dialogue throughout.

36162,A1HO9J4DCQDGP9,0780628551,"Kali ""bengaligirl""","[2, 4]","Okay, I'm going to upset the apple cart here, I enjoyed this film.  Johnny Depp was great as the possessed Astronaut who returns to earth after a space walk goes wrong.  Charlize Theron didn't do too badly either as his  super-sexy wife who isn't quite sure what is going on other than she is  pregnant and there's a chance her children just might not be human.  Yes it  is slow moving, yes it is an odd film but despite that it works for me.  The special effects aren't all that, but this is more of a film for those  of a cerebral nature and a lot is left to your own imagination.  The film  asks the question &quot;what if&quot; aliens didn't haven't to take human  form, &quot;what if&quot; they could attune themselves to a certain  electrical frequency, and take control of a human mind; after all we are  just electrical brain waves, our mind generating minute amounts of  electricity, similar to those generated in say a satellite?  As Charlize  realizes that all is not well with her husband, she struggles to make sense  of what is going on.  Why did her husband's fellow space walker die so  suddenly after returning to earth?  And his wife was pregnant when she  committed suicide, not only pregnant but pregnant with twins, the same as  Charlize.  Should she have an abortion or should she continue with her  pregnancy?  Charlize doesn't know which way to turn.  Her instincts are to  abort but her desire to be a mother is great.  The suspense in the film is  well orchestrated with Depp giving a solid performance as the man/alien  intent on his offspring being born.  He tells his wife whilst pointing at  her pregnant belly &quot;I live in there&quot; so that she knows he is  aware of everything she thinks and does.  This is a creepy film with an  equally creepy ending that is both intelligent and thought provoking.

36166,A16X61RLY1YJL7,0780628551,"K. Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[6, 8]","""The Astronaut's Wife"" is simply one of those films that I think I picked up due to an interest in Charlize Theron and Johnny Depp's acting careers more so than in the film itself.  Having said that, this DVD still sat on the shelf for a number of years until recently.  From a purely ""psychological thriller"" point of view, this film delivers but does so in a rather mediocre way.  From a Sci-Fi, point of view, the film struggles in all aspects other than the basic concept of the plot.In typical fashion, Charlize Theron delivers her part seamlessly.  As with all the parts I've seen her play, she gets inside the role and plays it out extremely well.  It's just too bad her performance cannot save the script or the director's vision of this film.  I can't say that I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan but I can say that I have a passing interest in his film career and have definitely seen much better performances from him prior to and after making this film.  Granted, the part he played here may have been a rather subdued role however; his interpretation of the role left much to be desired in his performance.I cannot say that I've seen any of the very few other films that have been directed by Rand Ravich however, given this film's performance both in the theaters and in post theater market, one can easily see why he's directed very few films since.  The score for the film was fitting per scene though.The Premise:Spencer (Johnny Depp) and his fellow astronaut end up out of communication for a mere two minutes while working on a satellite.  Upon their return to Earth, those two minutes become pivotal in the effect it has on Spencer and Jillian's (Charlize Theron) lives and the lives of his fellow astronaut and his wife played by the ever beautiful Donna Murphy.Overall, I would recommend this film only in the light that if you're a fan of either Johnny Depp or Charlize Theron and wishing to review their entire bodies of work.

And, just as you worried, something happens and all  commmunication to/from the shuttle --and him--  is cut off for two minutes.  He seems alright upon returning, then begins to do odd things, including  quitting his job and moving to NYC. At a company cocktail party, you both  are drunk, and you ask him once again what it was like, up there then. His  response of, &quot;it was cold....cold....i wanted to be with you....inside  you....&quot; only makes you feel the need for him.

The  events of the next months only serve to amplify your worries, as your belly  grows larger and your husband grows sinister.Now snap out of imagining.

In another review I once said The English Patient was sort of like a combination of the Elephant Man and Lawrence of Arabia, except that movie actually worked, but this one really doesn't, although I did appreciate the stylish cinematography--I'll give them credit for that.I didn't think the acting was as bad as some of the other reviewers here thought, but the premise is pretty silly--aliens erasing a couple of astronaut's brains with a powerful radio signal and then taking over their minds themselves--and even getting their wives pregnant with supposedly alien babies. Why all of this is so sinister is never really revealed, since most of the time the Johnny Depp character is helping his new employer design a new plane. And the babies are expected to be pilots some day. So what? This is supposed to be some sort of evil alien invasion or plot? Snore. Call me when the sky starts falling down.Still, the overall ambience was adequately creepy almost from the start to the end, and the special effects with the Depp/alien creature at the end getting fried were pretty cool--with some effects reminiscent of the Ark of the Convenant scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark.

The production is just gorgeous. It is a science fiction film unlike any other, because it negates special effects in favor of more psychological suspense, which definitely works to its' benefit.If you watch closely however, its amazing how little time Johnny Depp is actually on screen.

I can see why. It has a fatal flaw which denyed its having much commercial or critical success, but I feel that what's good about it is that it tries very hard to overcome this problem.Juliann and Spencer Armacut [Charleze Theron and Johnny Depp] are a married couple who are still madly in love. He's an astronaut, and she's a grammar school teacher. Except for his exotic profession, they could be a typical couple. Naturally, she worries about him, and her worst fears almost come true when there is an accident aboard a space shuttle. Spencer and a fellow astronaut are outside the craft repairing something when they are suddenly cut loose. For two agonizing minutes, they float helplessly in space. The rest of the crew manages to rescue them. Back on Earth, both men are hospitalized for a short while. It doesn't take very long for the two men's wives to figure out that their husbands are somehow different. Very different, as it turns out. These changes are not for the better.The movie is beautifully photographed. One scene in particular is brilliant. After the accident, the wives are rushed to NASA headquarters. There, Juliann stands in front of a huge television. A camera in the nose of the shuttle shows its approach for landing. It is as though Juliann were landing with the craft. The set designs are also good. In the beginning, all the sets are cozy and warm. When the couple moves to New York afterwards the incident, the sets are vast and cool and elegant. And somehow as empty as space itself.I have long felt that Johnny Depp is the best physical actor on the screen today. He has an otherworldly quality about him to begin with, and so he does not do as well as some other performers in the emotional sense. He builds his characters by body language. Charleze Theron is one of the most promising, as well as beautiful, young actresses around. She does her best work through her emotions. I think that, as a screen couple, they are an interesting pairing.Naturally, I won't reveal the ending, but I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't say that it is the fatal flaw. It makes The Astronaut's Wife end up like an elaborate joke with a bad punch line. I think the problem a lot of people have had with it is that everything else is crafted so well. This prevents it from being in the category they call Bad Movies We All Love. It is a shame that no one was able to bring the cast and crew back to shoot a different ending. Doing so is not all that uncommon. Many movies have been salvaged this way over the years. One famous example is Sunset Boulevard. The original opening had the unintended effect of causing the preview audiences to roll in the aisles with laughter. A new opening was filmed, and the movie became a hit, not to mention a classic.",3,Performs well until its rediculous conclusion,1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,2903,"['When', 'Astronaut', 'Wife', 'landed', 'theaters', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'off', 'fact', 'appeared', 'fall', 'off', 'distributor', 'launch', 'pad', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'denyed', 'having', 'much', 'commercial', 'critical', 'success', 'feel', 'what', 'good', 'very', 'hard', 'overcome', 'problem.Juliann', 'Spencer', 'Armacut', '[', 'Charleze', 'Theron', 'Johnny', 'Depp', ']', 'are', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'madly', 'love', 'astronaut', 'grammar', 'school', 'teacher', 'exotic', 'profession', 'could', 'be', 'typical', 'couple', 'Naturally', 'worst', 'fears', 'almost', 'come', 'true', 'when', 'accident', 'space', 'shuttle', 'Spencer', 'fellow', 'astronaut', 'are', 'craft', 'repairing', 'something', 'when', 'are', 'suddenly', 'cut', 'loose', 'two', 'agonizing', 'minutes', 'float', 'helplessly', 'space', 'rest', 'crew', 'rescue', 'Back', 'Earth', 'men', 'are', 'hospitalized', 'short', 'while', ""n't"", 'take', 'very', 'long', 'two', 'men', 'wives', 'figure', 'out', 'husbands', 'are', 'somehow', 'different', 'Very', 'different', 'out', 'changes', 'are', 'not', 'better.The', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'One', 'scene', 'particular', 'brilliant', 'accident', 'wives', 'are', 'rushed', 'NASA', 'headquarters', 'Juliann', 'front', 'huge', 'television', 'camera', 'nose', 'shuttle', 'approach', 'landing', 'Juliann', 'were', 'landing', 'craft', 'set', 'designs', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'beginning', 'sets', 'are', 'cozy', 'warm', 'When', 'couple', 'moves', 'New', 'York', 'incident', 'sets', 'are', 'vast', 'cool', 'elegant', 'somehow', 'as', 'empty', 'space', 'itself.I', 'have', 'long', 'felt', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'best', 'physical', 'actor', 'screen', 'today', 'otherworldly', 'quality', 'begin', 'so', 'not', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'performers', 'emotional', 'sense', 'characters', 'body', 'language', 'Charleze', 'Theron', 'one', 'most', 'promising', 'as', 'well', 'beautiful', 'young', 'actresses', 'best', 'work', 'emotions', 'think', 'that', 'screen', 'couple', 'are', 'interesting', 'pairing.Naturally', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'ending', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'doing', 'job', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'Astronaut', 'Wife', 'end', 'up', 'elaborate', 'joke', 'bad', 'punch', 'line', 'think', 'problem', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'had', 'everything', 'else', 'crafted', 'so', 'well', 'being', 'category', 'call', 'Bad', 'Movies', 'Love', 'shame', 'one', 'was', 'able', 'bring', 'cast', 'crew', 'back', 'shoot', 'different', 'ending', 'Doing', 'so', 'not', 'uncommon', 'Many', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'salvaged', 'way', 'years', 'One', 'famous', 'example', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'original', 'opening', 'had', 'unintended', 'effect', 'causing', 'preview', 'audiences', 'roll', 'aisles', 'laughter', 'new', 'opening', 'was', 'filmed', 'movie', 'became', 'hit', 'not', 'mention', 'classic']",N/A

B Cole ""Kegrun""","[1, 1]","Commander Spencer Armacost (Johnny Depp), an astronaut and a loving husband to Jillian (Charlize Theron), is lost in space for 2 minutes along with his partner Captain Alex Streck during a routine space walk to repair a broken satellite. After coming back to earth, tests are run on them and everything comes up ok on Spence, but Alex's heart takes a beating. He survives, but barely. The recordings that their suits picked up have them screaming in panic, but apparently, nothing happened. During a party that is thrown for the two astronauts, Alex suddenly and quite freakishly dies leaving his wife behind who begins to say some strange things about him to Jillian. As time goes by, an ex NASA employer comes to Jillian to tell her that he's discovered some strange things about her husband Spencer's readings. How everything is the same, but just a tad off. As pieces being to come together, she begins to second guess who her husband really is more and more. Did her husband return from space, or did something else? Or is she just going insane?I like this movie. Yeah, sometimes it felt a little drawn out, but I liked it. Until the ending that is. The whole movie felt very `what if'ish' to me. As in, ""What if he is or isn't an alien"" ""What if she's just going nuts"". I really don't think you can tell what's going on, until the very Hollywood ending. And when I say that I mean that Hollywood decided we were too stupid to decide on our own what happens, so they just let you know. Up until the ending though, I felt like I was watching a pretty good thriller. When we find out that Jillian had been locked up in a nut house before, you really don't know what to think. And every little thing you've seen becomes a `Well...this could be the reason' sort of idea.In the end I would say give it a rent if you've never seen it. Johnny Depp plays his party really well. So does Charlize, even though it felt and looked like she was doing Devils Advocate at the same time (same craziness and same short hair).P.S.

Charlize Theron plays the exact same character she played in Devil's Advocate, alongside another cutie, Keanu Reeves.

Which doesn't help if you've never seen it like me. So all the comparisons just go straight over my head.I only taped this off the TV ages ago for Johnny Depp. And wasn't too disappointed in the entire film. It had a good storyline and apart from Charlize Theron doing her one expression - bored - I did enjoy the film.Then the ending came, and I was holding onto a cushion like grim death, and hiding my face partly behind it. The ending changed my whole perspective of the film, and subsequently lowered my stars scale to 2. I didn't completely understand the ending, and my Dad got quite fed up trying to explain and figure out what exactly I didn't understand about the movie. If the ending had been left alone, and just been a happy ending (it is technically, but not the way I wanted it to be), then I would have been fine. But no, they had to go and totally confuse me.

Tresca ""Talien""","[15, 19]","Johnny Depp is my wife's favorite actor, so she bought The Astronaut's Wife from a bargain DVD bin when she saw his face on the cover.The plot's a little garbled, but it goes something like this: Capt. Alex Streck (Nick Cassavettes) and Commander Spence Armacost (Johnny Depp) go off on a space mission.  When they come back, they're different.  Some kind of weird sound--it sounds like shrieking static--was beamed into their bodies.  What it is, exactly, we're not sure.  Let's call it ""a possessing entity.""This malevolent entity wants to have children.  Twins, to be precise.  So Spence becomes fixated on 1) molesting his wife Jillian (Charlize Theron), and 2) building a spacecraft for two pilots.  And then Jillian finds out she's pregnant!  And soon, Streck dies of a seizure and his wife Natalie (Donna Murphy) commits suicide with a toaster!  And it turns out she was pregnant...WITH TWINS!Scary stuff, right?Well, no.  It's not scary.  In fact, the film lingers and drags.  Struggling to inject some urgency is the frenetic Sherman Reese (Joe Morton).  Sherman is convinced something is wrong.  He goes about it all the wrong way, of course, babbling on about aliens from outer space, harassing poor Jillian, and basically ensuring that he's a one note character, not an actually developed person.This movie is a blatant rip-off (or homage, if you think it's good) of Rosemary's Baby.  This explains Theron's pageboy haircut, but doesn't excuse anything else.  The battle of wills between husband and wife is really a battle of viewer's patience.  Will she escape her husband? Will Jillian abort the children? Does anyone care?It's hard to care.  For much of the film, we're not entirely convinced that there's anything actually wrong with Spence. He seems genuinely concerned with his wife; if the movie had bothered to keep us guessing, this would have made for an interesting twist (maybe she WAS crazy all along!).  But it devolves pretty quickly.There's lots of sexual symbolism, and not the good kind.  Yes folks, this is the first film I've ever seen that seriously showed a subway train entering a tunnel overlapped with Depp's ""Oh"" face (fans of Office Space will know what I mean).  Is that symbolism or what?Finally, Depp has affected a southern accent for no discernable reason.  It turns into something of a vague mumble and he shifts in and out of it (especially when angry), such that we're not sure if Spence really ever had an accent.  Wouldn't it have been cool if the accent disappeared when the alien possessed him?  Yeah, that would have been neat movie.Rosemary's Baby was very much a product of its time.  The Astronaut's Wife has all the pretty people and slick special effects, but never really bothers to reinforce the sinister nature of the people from beyond.  EVERYONE gets that the Devil is evil incarnate and that you don't want to have his baby.  The Astronaut's Wife never actually proves that the aliens are bad...Jillian's twins could go on to create world peace for all we know.Fortunately, Depp and Theron would go on to do much better works.

As other reviewers have pointed out, the subject has been covered in one form or another elsewhere. Though I've seen most of those movies, I was interested in the supernatrual aspects of the subject which weren't always examined in the other movies of this type.And I was disappointed. The movie has interesting plot twists, but they're not developed. They all constribute to a stressful but uncertain dramatic irony. The viewer is compelled to make guesses about who really knows what, and can't make a good conclusion about what any of the shallowly-played characters really understands.

Spencer Armacost and his partner goes on into space to repair a satellite when contact is lost with them for two minutes. After that they are recovered but upon returning to Earth, the partner dies of a heart attack, his wife kills herself, Spencer Armacost's wife Jillian becomes pregnant, and the couple moves. Fun times eh?Skip forward through a few boring parts, and you have the wife Jillian becoming paranoid that her husband may not be quite right. The hormone laden woman notices hubby's new bedroom roughness and other little clues that make her wonder whether her husband as she knew him is now gone, or whether the pregnancy is breaking her mind. Sound familiar?Surprisingly enough, and despite lukewarm reception, The Astronaut's Wife is a clever enough tale with more than competent acting and decent direction. The plot is outlandish, strange, and, while not offering horror fans too much of a different taste to their usual meal, it still makes sure the heart keeps kicking during certain scenes. While the script holds potential, weaknesses lie around many corners eager to bring the viewer down a couple of notches. Director (and scriptwriter)  Rand Ravich has fun behind the camera, utilizing some nifty shots, especially when Jillian becomes panicked and the camera starts whirling around.As always Johnny Depp does his very best, bringing Spencer to life as a sexy, dangerous being; Jillian, played by the gorgeous and endearing Charlene Theron, fits into her role like it's a second skin. All acting is more than competent; I could find no faults in this department.The main flaw that stands out is that the viewer knows very early on what has happened, and instead of much of the film being spent in suspense, it's in annoyance for the lead to hurry the hell up and figure it out. The ending is powerful, but still a bit off, and the final wrap up just doesn't' hold water. How the hell does this rapid change in her make sense??I recommend giving it a try but not shelling out the dough for the DVD without seeing it first.

I agree with the reviewer who thought that, perhaps, the Johnny Depp fans were expecting something completely different and weren't really open to what was presented, and, maybe this was responsible for a lot of the rather negative reviews.  Me?  I like Johnny Depp, but don't think he's been given much for roles.  Maybe, like Clint Eastwood, Johnny Depp might someday have something to say and be able to say it.  In the meantime, it's probably best he just attempt to do what he's told to do to his best ability, even if it is just a lot of crap that some CEO wants for his multi-million dollar bonus.  After all, Bush or 'Bama, CEO's become accountable for what is done and what is not done; when they seem to have the reins.  Multi-multi of billions of dollars stolen and, I know, let's just concentrate on a 7-11 hold-up and put that poor SOB in prison for the rest of his life!  It's so much more manageable.  And, I know, let's just blame billions of dollars in new home computers each year on a few high-school kids; who are so very difficult to locate.

I liked Andrew Niccol's, ""Gattaca.""  I liked ""Bladerunner"" and ""Close Encounters.""  This film was and is very appropriate and illuminating in our time.

Brown, an actress whose film career hasn't grown like her weight, has very little to do as the wife of Depp's new employer.  Murphy, a well-respected stage actress, has about as much screen time here as she did in last summer's blockbuster, ""Spiderman 2.""Morton is basically playing the same character, though slightly unhinged, that he played in ""Terminator 2""...or was it on TV's Smallville,""...or was it ""What Lies Beneath""?

Unfortunately, I got roped into this... and aside from the, uh,  &quot;climax&quot; &lt;snort&gt;, it wasn't really all that bad a movie,  aside from Charlize Theron's &quot;as ugly as I wanna be&quot;  hairdo.Johnny Depp and (how far the mighty have fallen!) Nick  Cassavettes are two astronauts who go into space to make some minor repairs  to a satellite, and are out of contact with Earth for two minutes while  they're on the other side of the shuttle. As a premise, this is kind of  boring; I didn't realize this wasn't a common occurrence on shuttle  missions. But, of course, something nasty happens, and the two come back to  earth in comas. Pretty soon Cassavettes and his wife (engagingly played by  Donna Murphy), the best of couples, are having marital problems, and Depp  and his wife (Theron) are close behind. Feel free to draw all conscusions  you need to-- and you're right. I don't need to spoil it, you can do it  yourselves well enough, I've no doubt.The good stuff here, aside from  a decent performance by Depp, is in the minor roles. Samatha Eggar pops up  as Theron's ob-gyn (and those of you familiar with Eggar's most famous role  will know why the irony of this was so delicious), and Clea DuVall, as  Theron's wisecracking sister, absolutely saved the first half of this movie  (note for Joy Fielding fans: DuVall is listed in the cast of the upcoming  See Jane Run).Unfortunately, these things aren't enough to hold it  all together, and as the plot slowly disintegrates (and this is another  case of &quot;great premise, bad execution&quot;) the whole thing becomes  laughable; by the time we get around to seeing the bad guy, we don't care  how stupid he is.

It preys on the underlying fears of humanity of being systematically wiped out.But this movie is NOT about the spread of an alien virus around the globe.

The wife, who has just learned she is pregnant, starts to wonder what happened to her husband up in space during his lost two minutes of communication with NASA. She is approached by a former employee of NASA who says he has answers for her, so she reluctantly agrees to meet him. She follows the information he gives her, which leads her to the truth. She begins having mental visions of her babies and of what her husband is doing in the present.

I don't understand what all the hubbuub is about, The Astronaut's Wife was not that bad a movie.  Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron superbly portrayed their  characters, right down to the smallest detail.  Depp really shows how far  his acting range can extend to.  And Theron completely took me by surprise,  she really steals the show.  As for all the comparisons to Rosemary's Baby,  they are few and very far between.  The most apparent would be Theron's  hair style which is a distant reminder of Mia Farrow.  But from this man's  point of view, this film completely stands on its own as original,  entertaining, and thrilling.  My only beef is the DVD itself, there aren't  any special features included save a theatrical trailer and a few  biographys.  Although a director commentary and/or making of documentary  would have been a nice bonus, the picture and sound are both a ten, and  that is enough to satisfy me.Just imagine, a character-driven science  fiction.  What's more, there are only two visual effects shots throughout  the entire movie, which says something.  One might say that the film budget  was too low to allow it to become an effects movie.  I disagree, though,  because for what it lacked in effects the movie made up for in story,  acting, directing, and script.  Please watch this with an open mind, don't  let all the critics sway you.  It never ceases to amaze me how many people  will believe and watch a movie based on what one or two people have said  about it.

36212,A1Y8FBJLVK6LS9,0780628551,Wayne A.,"[89, 102]","I watch a fair number of slower paced, atmospheric foreign films that kind of stew in their own juices. I enjoy them. I also like old sci-fi. This film vaguely reminded me of Tarkovsky's ""Solaris""--a fave for me. I hope that comparison is helpful to people interested in this movie.I enjoyed this film. It took an old B-movie story (I think it was ""I Married a Space Monster""), and stood it on its head while maintaining the initial point of ""what's the difference between body and mind, or soul and genetics."" A lot of body in this film and I think that was part of the point. Using an old, and predictable, story or premise as a vehicle is not uncommon--we all knew how the new King Kong was going to end, didn't we--so when it's done, the thing I look for is the shape and flavor of the things hanging off that trite story line, and how it all interacts with our imposition of predestination on a flick.A hundred plus bad reviews down below--REALLY bad reviews--but after reading many of them I sense a common problem. Johnny Dep is a cult phenomenon, but he's also a fine actor. No matter what he does, he drags a large fan base with him. I think here he accidentally dragged his fan base into a kind movie that just doesn't appeal to fans of sexy media personalities. In a way, Dep's attractiveness and sex appeal work against his proven ability to be a serious and diverse actor. I never see a film BECAUSE Dep is in it, but I do often watch films that happen to have him in the cast and I frequently marvel at his performances.A tiny handful of good reviews of this movie and I believe every one, no matter how sincere the opinion or well-argued the case--received ONLY ""not helpful"" votes. I tried to remedy that. Whenever I encounter that sort of skewed voting on an Amazon item, I sense it's almost always in regard to a product that's controversial and people are voting their personal feelings about the issue, not voting for-or-against the genuine helpfulness of the review in question. Write and post a reasoned, tautly argued negative critique of a Michael Moore film or a book on Intelligent Design and watch the negative votes roll in. It's like running for Congress.What you're seeing here with these reviews of ""The Astronaut's Wife"" is American Marketing Culture in action. Anyone shopping for Moore or Intelligent Design or Johnny Dep product on Amazon is already an integral part of that niche market the product is carefully designed for. They've largely made up their minds about the topics at hand, so criticism of the topic (its quality, premises, facts--or lack of them--and conclusions, all legitimate targets for intelligent criticism of any book or film) is absolutely not what they're seeking. They give ""not helpful"" votes to people who are not part of their niche market or (or tribe or clan or cult, to use more appropriate lingo) and add in the 100th glowing five star review that is less a criticism and more a hymn of devotion and admiration; a vote FOR the the favored topic or beloved personality at hand.The precise reverse happens here. Fans--through skewed one and two star voting and unrelenting damnation--are letting the world know that they don't ever want to see Dep in another movie that bores THEM. This is a signal to the marketing people who help guide Dep's career and it's a totally legitimate communication from Consumers in a Marketing Culture (and really, what else are we these days?). The feedback just isn't what can be considered serious reviews and criticism.People who disagree with the democratic mob sentiment--like that sad handful who, in the heat of a revolution, sheepishly raise their hands to vote NO in the token rubberstamp vote on whether to storm the palace--are to be slammed down hard; here by informing them (through unanimous ""not helpful"" votes) their errant opinion is, more truthfully, ""not helpful to the cause""--the ""cause"" being to never have to endure the discomfort of seeing a beloved media figure perform in a film of a ""type"" ""style"" or ""genre"" that is clearly not enjoyed by these fans.It's a sad thing to have to note, and I wouldn't be expecting much sympathy for such a view, but within these Amazon pages we may actually be witnessing deep truths about people's perceptions and attitudes about democracy, dissent, opinion, and dialogue.",4,A fascinating series of reviews below,1159660800,"10 1, 2006",2006,4330,"['watch',
