Even though I never was a fan of Suzanne Somers, her character being written off the show was kinda heartbreaking. Otherwise, this is an excellent season of this hilarious show. Don Knotts is still a hoot as Mr. Furley and Joyce DeWitt had some great moments in season five. I highly recommend this classic sitcom.",5,Goodbye to Suzanne.,1202601600,"02 10, 2008",2008,392,"['Three', 'Company', 'Season', 'Five', 'season', 'said', 'farewell', 'Chrissy', 'Snow', 'Even', 'never', 'was', 'fan', 'Suzanne', 'Somers', 'character', 'being', 'written', 'off', 'show', 'was', 'kinda', 'heartbreaking', 'Otherwise', 'excellent', 'season', 'hilarious', 'show', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'still', 'hoot', 'Mr.', 'Furley', 'Joyce', 'DeWitt', 'had', 'great', 'moments', 'season', 'five', 'highly', 'recommend', 'classic', 'sitcom']",Three's Company: Season 5
892932,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B0007WQHFS,andy8047,"[8, 19]","The 1980-81 season,the fifth for Three's Company began late due to an actors' strike. The strike began in the summer and ended in the early fall. TC's spinoff The Ropers got the Nielsen axe but would appear for the very last time at one point during this season. Here we see Jack(the late John Ritter) entertaining four different women in three different apartments(his,his buddy Larry Dallas's(Richard Kline) and landlord Ralph Furley's(Don Knotts). Jack being harrassed on the job at a diner by his female boss(Jack thought that but actually he was fired due to unsatisfactory performance and misconduct). Chrissy's(Suzanne Somers) high school friend staying at the trio's apartment because her(the friend's) hotel lost her reservation. Jack,Janet(Joyce DeWitt),Larry and Ralph spending the weekend at a ski lodge. Jack working as a mechanical man in a department store window(in that episode Jack falls in love with a woman whom he delivers flowers to as a favor to Janet. The woman is Larry's girlfriend also with three other boyfriends!) Jack working as a busboy in a fancy French restaurant. Jack and Janet welcoming Chrissy's clumsy but beautiful cousin Cindy Snow(Jenilee Harrison) to the apartment(here is where Harrison begins her tenure with TC. She would appear first during the end credits while Somers continued appearing in name and face during the opening montage). Cindy would fill in for Chrissy at her place of employment as a typist/secretary. So in the next episode,her(Cindy's) boss temporarily fires her,thinking she's tired of running errands for him. Jack takes a chef's job at Angelino's restaurant,under the name David Miller(Jack would be fired and rehired several times from this point on. Also Jack's tenures at Angelino's led to his opening of Jack's Bistro in late 1982). An elderly widow practically adopts Jack(she washed the trio's dishes,cleaned their oven and mended two pairs of Jack's pants). Janet on a date with Jack's girlfriend's widowed father. Janet's parents visiting the trio and Jack and Janet pretending to be a married couple to please the parents. Cindy trying to escape the clutches of a wife-hungry millionaire(Jeffrey Tambor,late of The Ropers). The millionaire was married five times before,and as a matter of fact,the third marriage didn't last one day! After Ralph loses his apartment to his termination as landlord,he stays with the trio but ends up winning back his apartment and job(Ralph's brother Bart Furley appears for the first and only time during the series). Jack and Larry ""trade places"",but the arrangement fails. Not even one day,and Jack missed Janet and Cindy sorely. Jack teaching culinary arts at the L.A. technical college,where he graduated with a degree in that subject in the final episode last season(this is a reunion between Jack and Dean Travers(William Pierson) who ran the college. One of Jack's students is Travers' beautiful niece Betty Jean. And another is Janet!). Thinking Cindy is pregnant,Jack proposes marriage. Who's actually pregnant is Kelly,one of the Regal Beagle's waitresses. The father is Doug Cooper(John McCook,late of the CBS daytime serial The Young & The Restless and who would later become one of The Bold & The Beautiful cast),a fashion phtographer Cindy was dating. The late Norman Fell and the late Audra Lindley reprise their respective roles of the trio's former landlords Stanley and Helen Roper for the very last time when they visit the trio while celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary. It turns out after a heated argument,Helen strayed from Stanley. Helen and Stanley stay at Ralph's apartment,exactly where they lived before. Ralph was supposed to be away for the weekend and ended up coming back home after a disappointing experience. Jack pretending he has a twin brother named Austin from Texas(Austin dresses exactly like Jack. Jack performs the pretense for Ralph's beautiful visiting niece Veronica. When Ralph leaves his apartment,Jack goes back to his real self in front of Veronica). A jealous man plans to kill Jack for involving himself with his(the jealous man's) girlfriend. Jack fakes his death so Max,the jealous man wouldn't have to kill him. In real life,Ritter died in September 2003 following a heart disorder. Also,Jack and Janet think Cindy has been kidnapped but Cindy was with her father. While Jack and Janet were at the movies,Cindy's father showed up at the trio's apartment,and the pair took off immediately. Jack and Janet found Cindy and her father at a motel. Also,Jack learns that honesty is not always the best policy. Jack's honesty led to a break-up with his girlfriend,Larry breaking up with his girlfriend and a heated argument between Janet and Cindy. In several episodes,Chrissy was seen on a telephone in Fresno where she was taking care of her ailing mother,talking to either Jack or Janet. Just before this season began,Somers requested a raise in her weekly salary. After the request was denied,she threatened to sue and spitefully didn't show up for work. Also,Ritter and DeWitt were upset with Somers and at the end of this season,she was officially fired. At the beginning of the 1981-82 season,Harrison stayed on,thus appearing in the opening montage. But she'd move out of the apartment to attend UCLA(University of California at Los Angeles).",5,Goodbye Suzanne,1115251200,"05 5, 2005",2005,5313,"['1980-81', 'season', 'fifth', 'Three', 'Company',

I really missed Chrissy, but the show itself was still fantastic.  Mr. Furley was a great replacement.  He brought a totally new comedy that I loved.  I think the only thing that bothered me was the discs themselves.  Disc 1 and 2 were plain and silver with the titles of the shows printed on the discs.  Exactly like my Seasons 1-4 are.  Then disc 3 has a color picture of Chrissy looking like she's crying.  Makes me wonder...why would they do that?  Almost like they wanted to everyone to see her shamed?  I don't know why but that just bothered me.  Other than that, the show was fantastic.  I will always love this show.

892934,A96NYDFCD3QU2,B0007WQHFS,DC,"[6, 8]","I'm sorry, but no matter how you look at it, the dynamics of this show were with the original six, including the Chrissy character, which made Jack and Janet funnier, since Janet was always watching over Jack, since Chrissy was always unknowingly sexy. The replacement characters didn't have that quality, and the show was never AS funny again. Please note this comment is not about the actresses. The character of Cindy was clumsy but not desired by Jack, and the Terri character was smart and more of a comic sidekick for Janet. You can't re-create magic. The Chrissy character truly had it.  I wish I could give this season more stars, but like many fans, I really invested in the Chrissy character, and her completely unbelievable disappearance to take care of a sick relative without ever hearing from her ever again was a slap in the face to the fans of this show.  Although this season rates the lowest for me, it picks up more stars in the next season, so I have to give this season a two.Now, in the case of Suzanne Somers, the sitcom star, many people are in deep denial here: it takes a very smart actress to play a dumb blonde. Ms. Somers is and has been underrated. On top of that, she opened the door for future TV talent to get a fair share of the pie. The female leads (DeWitt and Somers) both received a lot less in salary than Ritter, a fact that would be overturned in 1981 if they were men. The contract called for any increase in one actress' salary to match the other's, and for that increase to also increase Mr. Ritter's contract, keeping his salary significantly above the actresses' salaries.  Now I'm not here to speculate what each one deserved, but the fact is that they ALL deserved a raise in the fifth year.  The producers, who were taking in big money for a number one show by this time, were unwilling to negotiate with Suzanne's request for an increase in the contract renewal. It is important to recognize an artist's contribution to the success of a show.  Today's TV stars get much more respect and better treatment, and they have Suzanne Somers to thank for that.And why does all of this matter in reviewing Season Five of Three's Company? Because a radical shift in direction like this changes the tone of a show. Each cast member, including the imaginative John Ritter (whose contribution to television history is indisputable) and the committed Joyce DeWitt (bless the trouper) are important comical pieces of a puzzle. As a result of this shift, the writing changed, the suspension of belief changed, the quality changed. No one really acknowledged Chrissy's absence in any profound way (were they really a family of friends after all?), nor did Cindy even mention her cousin.  Come on, people!  Have a little more respect for your loyal audience, who follows the show.  It became watered-down, and a bit more goofy, a bit more corny and silly.Maybe that's okay - as the change from the Ropers to Mr. Furley didn't seem to harm that tone. But take a closer look at seasons one and two. There is some truly groundbreaking work there in the writing and the message sent to America about people living together back in March, 1977. It was funny and sexy, and yet there was some serious social commentary underneath the humor (almost in the way All In The Family had). In terms of the story of these characters, Three's Company became a completely different show. While the original show was more daring (and leaving Jack and Janet alone, unmarried and living together would have been a move forward to keep it daring), fans will clamor for the full series on DVD to enjoy the works of the late John Ritter and Joyce DeWitt, with the latter seasons to enjoy Don Knotts.  For the talent alone, it is worth the watch.To her credit, my favorite Joyce DeWitt moment is in a non-Chrissy episode later in season six. I know what I've stated - but she holds her own in ""Some Of That Jazz"", where she believes she has what it takes to make it as a dancer, and her mentor/instructor has less than honorable intentions. Toward the end, Jack has a tender moment with Janet and share a slow dance with her. That moment for Ms. DeWitt is REAL, she's really crying, and I tear every time I watch it to this day. That's the show I wish it turned into.To sum it up, here's my final two cents: if there was ever gonna be a sequel to Three's Company, it should have been called JACK AND JANET!!!",2,"SUZANNE IS SORELY MISSED, BETTER WITHOUT REPLACEMENT FORMULA",1120521600,"07 5, 2005",2005,4416,"[""'m"", 'sorry', 'matter', 'how', 'look', 'dynamics', 'show', 'were', 'original', 'six', 'including', 'Chrissy', 'character', 'made', 'Jack', 'Janet', 'funnier', 'Janet', 'was', 'always', 'watching', 'Jack', 'Chrissy', 'was', 'always', 'unknowingly', 'sexy', 'replacement', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'quality', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'AS', 'funny', 'again', 'Please', 'note', 'comment', 'not', 'actresses', 'character', 'Cindy', 'was', 'clumsy', 'not', 'desired', 'Jack', 'Terri', 'character', 'was', 'smart', 'more', 'comic', 'sidekick', 'Janet', 'ca', ""n't"", 're-create', 'magic', 'Chrissy', 'character', 'truly', 'had', 'wish', 'could', 'give', 'season', 'more', 'stars', 'many', 'fans', 'really', 'invested', 'Chrissy', 'character', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'disappearance', 'take', 'care', 'sick', 'relative', 'ever', 'hearing', 'ever', 'again', 'was', 'slap', 'face', 'fans', 'show', 'season', 'rates', 'lowest', 'up', 'more', 'stars', 'next', 'season', 'so', 'have', 'give', 'season', 'two.Now', 'case', 'Suzanne', 'Somers', 'sitcom', 'star', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'deep', 'denial', 'here', 'very', 'smart', 'actress', 'play', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'Ms.', 'Somers', 'been', 'underrated', 'top', 'opened', 'door', 'future', 'TV', 'talent', 'get', 'fair', 'share', 'pie', 'female', 'leads', 'DeWitt', 'Somers', 'received', 'lot', 'less', 'salary', 'Ritter', 'fact', 'would', 'be', 'overturned', '1981', 'were', 'men', 'contract', 'called', 'increase', 'one', 'actress', 'salary', 'match', 'other', 'increase', 'also', 'increase', 'Mr.', 'Ritter', 'contract', 'keeping', 'salary', 'significantly', 'actresses', 'salaries', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'here', 'speculate', 'what', 'one', 'deserved', 'fact', 'deserved', 'raise', 'fifth', 'year', 'producers', 'who', 'were', 'taking', 'big', 'money', 'number', 'one', 'show', 'time', 'were', 'unwilling', 'negotiate', 'Suzanne', 'request', 'increase', 'contract', 'renewal', 'important', 'recognize', 'artist', 'contribution', 'success', 'show', 'Today', 'TV', 'stars', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'respect', 'better', 'treatment', 'have', 'Suzanne', 'Somers', 'thank', 'that.And', 'why', 'matter', 'reviewing', 'Season', 'Five', 'Three', 'Company', 'radical', 'shift', 'direction', 'tone', 'show', 'cast', 'member', 'including', 'imaginative', 'John', 'Ritter', 'contribution', 'television', 'history', 'indisputable', 'committed', 'Joyce', 'DeWitt', 'trouper', 'are', 'important', 'comical', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'result', 'shift', 'writing', 'changed', 'suspension', 'belief', 'changed', 'quality', 'changed', 'one', 'really', 'acknowledged', 'Chrissy', 'absence', 'profound', 'way', 'were', 'really', 'family', 'friends', 'did', 'Cindy', 'even', 'mention', 'cousin', 'Come', 'people', 'Have', 'little', 'more', 'respect', 'loyal', 'audience', 'who', 'show', 'became', 'watered-down', 'bit', 'more', 'goofy', 'bit', 'more', 'corny', 'silly.Maybe', 'okay', 'change', 'Ropers', 'Mr.', 'Furley', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'harm', 'tone', 'take', 'closer', 'look', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'truly', 'groundbreaking', 'work', 'there', 'writing', 'message', 'sent', 'America', 'people', 'living', 'together', 'back', 'March', '1977', 'was', 'funny', 'sexy', 'yet', 'was', 'serious', 'social', 'commentary', 'humor', 'almost', 'way', 'All', 'Family', 'had', 'terms', 'story', 'characters', 'Three', 'Company', 'became', 'completely', 'different', 'show', 'original', 'show', 'was', 'more', 'daring', 'leaving', 'Jack', 'Janet', 'alone', 'unmarried', 'living', 'together', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'move', 'forward', 'keep', 'daring', 'fans', 'will', 'clamor', 'full', 'series', 'DVD', 'enjoy', 'works', 'late', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Joyce', 'DeWitt', 'latter', 'seasons', 'enjoy', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'talent', 'alone', 'watch.To', 'credit', 'favorite', 'Joyce', 'DeWitt', 'moment', 'non-Chrissy', 'episode', 'later', 'season', 'six', 'know', 'what', ""'ve"", 'stated', 'own', 'Jazz', 'where', 'what', 'make', 'dancer', 'mentor/instructor', 'less', 'honorable', 'intentions', 'end', 'Jack', 'tender', 'moment', 'Janet', 'share', 'slow', 'dance', 'moment', 'Ms.', 'DeWitt', 'REAL', 'really', 'crying', 'tear', 'time', 'watch', 'day', 'show', 'wish', 'turned', 'into.To', 'sum', 'up', 'here', 'final', 'two', 'cents', 'was', 'ever', 'gon', 'be', 'sequel', 'Three', 'Company', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'JACK', 'AND', 'JANET']",Three's Company: Season 5

While much smarter than Chrissy, Cindy proves to be a klutz, frequently tripping, knocking things over and running into people...usually Jack, who was the main source of physical comedy to this point.Although Somers still appears in the opening credits, she only appears in small segments at the end of episodes, where she is supposedly at her parents' home, calling her old friends. This was, supposedly, because Somers had walked off the set upset over her salary, and was no longer on speaking terms with the cast. (In fact, Somers came to the studio to record her end of the telephone conversations early in the day, before either John Ritter or Joyce DeWitt, so she would not have to interact with them. The scenes were later edited to appear as if the characters were together.)While providing some sense of continuity, the calls are rather ridiculous...even for Chrissy, who had always been portrayed as ditzy and dumb. Her end of the conversation is always so exasperating that Jack or Janet are shown rolling their eyes and putting down the phone in frustration.

Somers started to miss work, conveniently blaming it on a back injury she sustained. So entered Cindy Snow, played by Jennilee Harrison.With all due respect, Harrison was not an experienced actress, much less an experienced comedic actress. Unlike Priscilla Barnes, whom the producers had ample time to find, Harrison was a last minute replacement that the producers had to scrambled to find with pratically just days on their hands. Furthermore, while Teri Alden was a completely original character, Harrison was stuck with a character whose purpose was use up the scripts that was already written with Chrissy in mind. You have to admit that Harrison was faced with a bunch of hurdles while on the show.While I sympathize with Harrison, I still have to admit, she is no Chrissy Snow or Suzanne Somers, although she did made a good effort and showed that another blonde roommate other than Chrissy is possible for the show. After Suzanne Somers left, something did went out with the show that it never could quite replace. Ironically, Harrison would have some her best moments in Season Six, particularly in the episode ""Maid to Order"", where the storylines were actually written with her character in mind.In any case, season five still managed to generate a lot of laughs in episodes such as ""And Justice For Jack"", ""Downhill Chaser"", ""The Case of the Missing Blonde"", ""Dying to Meet You"", ""Father of the Bride"", and Somer's last full show: ""A Hundred Dollars a What"". But still I wouldn't say that this year deserve a five stars rating, which is another problem I have with people who review on Amazon.com...they give out five star ratings like Halloween candy.As for the DvD cover, it is misleading to show Suzanne on the cover, but perhaps, it is done contractually....during the entire season of Seasn Five, Suzanne is still billed as the star while Harrison got relegated to ""guest-starring"" status.

892947,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0007WQHFS,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[3, 10]","The idea of making a sitcom based on roommates living together and the troubles that living together could produce generated a successful comedy sitcom named Three's Company.  The show aired between 1977 and 1984, and it is initial major twist was the senseless beauty Chrissy (Suzanne Somers) and attractive flower girl Janet (Joyce DeWitt) who live with culinary student Jack Tripper (John Ritter).  At the time, it was very controversial for men and women to live under the same roof if they were not married, as stereotypes often caused people to make strong sexual implications about people of opposite sexes that co-inhabit the same apartment.  This might have been the major reason why Three's Company was successful, as it often built its comic scenarios around stereotypes, misconceptions, and misunderstandings.Jack has got away with living with Chrissy and Janet by telling his landlord that he is gay, which indicates that he would have no interest in the women in the apartment.  However, the lie also backfires on occasion to create additional awkward situations for Jack.  There are also many other situations that arise through other people's misunderstandings of what is being said or done, which builds up new situational humor for the audience.  It is in Jack's attempts to get out of the situations where he often worsens the moment with his clumsiness.  It is within these situations that the sitcom finds its value, as it offers an insight to the social context of the moment through a comic approach.Early on in the fifth season, Suzanne Somers left the show when her demands on an increase in salary were not met.  Her dimwitted presence, as Chrissy was dearly missed, but Chrissy's cousin, Cindy Snow (Jenilee Harrison) picks up where Somers left off with a refreshing breeze of slapstick humor to complement Ritter's comic skills.  However, it is noticeable that the show has begun its slow decline until its end, as the shows began to feel more repetitive and unoriginal.  Nonetheless, the sitcom offers moments of terrific humor through its 22 episodes of the fifth season.",3,Chrissy Leaves Janet and Jack in Fifth Season...,1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,2101,"['idea', 'making', 'sitcom', 'based', 'roommates', 'living', 'together', 'troubles', 'living', 'together', 'could', 'produce', 'generated', 'successful', 'comedy', 'sitcom', 'named', 'Three', 'Company', 'show', 'aired', '1977', '1984', 'initial', 'major', 'twist', 'was', 'senseless', 'beauty', 'Chrissy', 'Suzanne', 'Somers', 'attractive', 'flower', 'girl', 'Janet', 'Joyce', 'DeWitt', 'who', 'live', 'culinary', 'student', 'Jack', 'Tripper', 'John', 'Ritter', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'controversial', 'men', 'women', 'live', 'same', 'roof', 'were', 'not', 'married', 'stereotypes', 'often', 'caused', 'people', 'make', 'strong', 'sexual', 'implications', 'people', 'opposite', 'sexes', 'co-inhabit', 'same', 'apartment', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'major', 'reason', 'why', 'Three', 'Company', 'was', 'successful', 'often', 'built', 'comic', 'scenarios', 'stereotypes', 'misconceptions', 'misunderstandings.Jack', 'got', 'away', 'living', 'Chrissy', 'Janet', 'telling', 'landlord', 'gay', 'would', 'have', 'interest', 'women', 'apartment', 'However', 'lie', 'also', 'occasion', 'create', 'additional', 'awkward', 'situations', 'Jack', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'other', 'situations', 'arise', 'other', 'people', 'misunderstandings', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'done', 'up', 'new', 'situational', 'humor', 'audience', 'Jack', 'attempts', 'get', 'situations', 'where', 'often', 'moment', 'clumsiness', 'situations', 'sitcom', 'value', 'insight', 'social', 'context', 'moment', 'comic', 'approach.Early', 'fifth', 'season', 'Suzanne', 'Somers', 'left', 'show', 'when', 'demands', 'increase', 'salary', 'were', 'not', 'met', 'dimwitted', 'presence', 'Chrissy', 'was', 'dearly', 'missed', 'Chrissy', 'cousin', 'Cindy', 'Snow', 'Jenilee', 'Harrison', 'up', 'where', 'Somers', 'left', 'off', 'refreshing', 'breeze', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'complement', 'Ritter', 'comic', 'skills', 'However', 'noticeable', 'show', 'begun', 'slow', 'decline', 'end', 'shows', 'began', 'feel', 'more', 'repetitive', 'unoriginal', 'Nonetheless', 'sitcom', 'moments', 'terrific', 'humor', '22', 'episodes', 'fifth', 'season']",Three's Company: Season 5

892949,A2GBQRSI8FPAL,B0007WQHFS,K. O. Gibson,"[2, 3]","By now, we're all up to speed on the behind-the-scenes machinations of this classic television sitcom from an era where there were only three television networks to choose from (besides UHF).For its time, especially the '70s seasons, 'Three's Company' was pretty risque for prime-time television with its ribald/charmingly naughty look at three adult 'kids'(gasp)living together in Southern California and the male roommate (Mr. Ritter) supposedly gay. Groundbreaking stuf and with the writing, production and acting talent to pull it off.Season 5 is the season where all of America knew something was going on behind the scenes but the public relations machine of a bygone era kept most of it at bay, unless you were watching daytime talk shows and saw either Suzanne Somers, clearly unhappy and marginal, on talk shows or the genuine enthusiasm of Jenilee Harrison on the same circuit rallying viewers that all was okay.As for Jenilee Harrison, of the revolving roommates in the wake of Mrs. Somers, she is similar to the many James Bonds in the 007 franchise. For my generation, it depends on when you were able to watch 'Three's Company' every week (without being sent to bed) that you latch onto whichever actress was prominent at the time. For me, it was Jenilee...she brought a slapstick, gorgeous innocence to the roommate-dynamic that not only reassured a lot of viewers but also was metaphorical for the offstage turmoil happening around them. As a worker in the entertainment industry now in my late 30s, I can only imagine that Jenilee's addition to the cast soothed the proprietary egos and tension that affected the entire production staff.Season Five is the same comfort food TV that any regular viewer of the show remembers. As other reviewers have mentioned, Joyce DeWitt has more room to play and becomes the clear-cut alpha female of the show. She is a deft comedian with perfect timing, a more sophisticated style and perhaps it's just natural time passing by and our knowledge, in hindsight, of the pressures of the show that makes some of her acting 'business' seem more slapstick and shrill, as if the directors want to fill up every second. John Ritter, the male star, is even more elastic and affable and his talent is missed. Don Knotts and Richard Kline have more airtime too with mixed results, depending on your fondness for them in the first place. Suzanne Somers' now infamous 'tags' at the end of the show get increasingly more far-fetched, taking the 'dumb blonde' schtick to a nadir I'm sure even she didn't appreciate, wardrobe and disco ponytails notwithstanding. By the time she stops appearing, it seems almost merciful to both role and actress.All in all, a fun season to replay and witness the professionalism required of a juggernaut show giving its A-game to stay a hit and not unravel at a critical time. Again, I'm team Jenilee on this one. I liked Suzanne Somers and, later, Priscilla Barnes' refreshingly lucid take within the show's formula, but considering that Jenilee was only 20 years old and had to mesh with actors long ensconced in their roles, she deserves credit for smoothing the fences and endearing herself to millions of fans at a time when every viewer counted.

The story lines really started to let John Ritter showcase his physical comedy and while Jenilee Harrison is not usually thought of as the best of the blond roommates (I prefer Terry myself) I really believe that she brought John Ritter's physcial comedy up a notch.  They work well together. And with this fifth season, the show really started to leave the confines of Apartment 201 and expand.  Not to mention that we meet, for the first time, Mr. Angelino and Felipe in the hilarious episode of ""The Not-So-Great Imposter. ""The ""Upstairs, Downstairs, Upstairs"" episode is as good an episode of any in the show's eight seasons.

After letting success go to her head, she demanded an outrageous pay raise. After her salary demands were refused, she was absent from a few episodes(one of which had to be scrapped). As a result of her absences, Chrissy Snow is sent home to take care of her sick mother, and is cut down to a 60 second telephone scene in a few episodes.(Her telephone scenes were filmed earlier in the day and behind the show's set since the other actors no longer wanted to work with her). Meanwhile, Jenilee Harrison moves in as the third roommate, Cindy Snow, the cousin of Chrissy Snow. Cindy brings a lot of comedy to the series as Chrissy's very clumsy, but well-meaning cousin. I actually do prefer Cindy over Chrissy, just as I prefer Jenilee over Suzanne. With or without Chrissy, John Ritter's comedy is what made the show a hit, for he was(and is) the show's undisputed star. Suzanne is fired at the end of this season, and Chrissy Snow is never again mentioned, and no reason is ever given on the show as to why Chrissy does not return. She brought everything on herself. Thank You, Suzanne, for allowing new characters to come on the show, and for allowing the show's star, JOHN RITTER, to shine brighter. You are not a nice person, Miss Somers.

I have always loved Joyce DeWitt and I still do think the world of her. Jenilee Harrison was ... wow! And then, there is my favorite. The one ... the only ... Priscilla Barnes. The most beautiful girl on the planet. And not only was my Priscilla right-off-the-chart beautiful but, she practically single handedly saved seasons 6, 7 and 8. Oh how I hated to see this show end it's run. But, it remains one of those shows, much like &#34;The Honeymooners&#34; that you can watch over and over and over and it just never gets old. Yes Three's Company will always remain a favorite show of mine, especially seasons 6, 7 and 8 with the impossibly beautiful Priscilla Barnes.",5,Another Great Season Of Fun,1381881600,"10 16, 2013",2013,753,"['Three', 'Company', 'long', 'been', 'favorite', 'show', 'mine', 'John', 'Ritter', 'was', 'great', 'guy', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'Joyce', 'DeWitt', 'still', 'do', 'think', 'world', 'Jenilee', 'Harrison', 'was', 'wow', 'then', 'favorite', 'one', 'only', 'Priscilla', 'Barnes', 'most', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'planet', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'Priscilla', 'right-off-the-chart', 'beautiful', 'practically', 'single', 'handedly', 'saved', 'seasons', '6', '7', '8', 'Oh', 'how', 'hated', 'see', 'show', 'end', 'run', 'one', 'shows', 'much', '34', 'Honeymooners', '34', 'can', 'watch', 'just', 'never', 'old', 'Yes', 'Three', 'Company', 'will', 'always', 'remain', 'favorite', 'show', 'mine', 'especially', 'seasons', '6', '7', '8', 'impossibly', 'beautiful', 'Priscilla', 'Barnes']",Three's Company: Season 5
