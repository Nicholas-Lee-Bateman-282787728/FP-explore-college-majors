1355923,A2E3IK8EJAKMB6,B003NX6C1C,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","Warning: Watching this show will make you want to go to the range!I happened to catch the last couple episodes of Season One a few months ago just after it had ended (during one of History's marathons), and quickly started to like it.  By that point in the show, there were only a few shooters left in the competition so I really got to see the best of the best.  Then I started watching Season Two and knew I had to get more Top Shot.  Also, my fiance hadn't seen Season One, but after (literally) forcing her to watch the first episode of Season Two, she was hooked, too.  So we got it for a great price on Amazon and were watching it that weekend.The show itself is hard to describe.  Sure, the shooting is what you really want to see when you first start watching, but after a time you really become invested in the competitors, too.  I hate reality TV, and sometimes the in-house politics gets annoying, but once they get out on the range and display their skill, all that crap disappears for a while.  I'd say it's split pretty even, half the show is goofy reality TV stuff, and the other half is shooting.  After a while, some of the more annoying ones go away and you're left with a group of guys and girl that you can really respect.Essentially, if you're a weapons enthusiast in any way shape or form, or just love a good show of skill, Top Shot will not disappoint.  Definitely worth the low price on Amazon.",5,Awesome Show,1303776000,"04 26, 2011",2011,1419,"['Warning', 'Watching', 'show', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'go', 'range', 'happened', 'catch', 'last', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Season', 'One', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'just', 'had', 'ended', 'one', 'History', 'marathons', 'quickly', 'started', 'point', 'show', 'were', 'only', 'few', 'shooters', 'left', 'competition', 'really', 'got', 'see', 'best', 'best', 'Then', 'started', 'watching', 'Season', 'Two', 'knew', 'had', 'get', 'more', 'Top', 'Shot', 'Also', 'fiance', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Season', 'One', 'literally', 'forcing', 'watch', 'first', 'episode', 'Season', 'Two', 'was', 'hooked', 'too', 'got', 'great', 'price', 'Amazon', 'were', 'watching', 'show', 'hard', 'describe', 'Sure', 'shooting', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'when', 'first', 'start', 'watching', 'time', 'really', 'become', 'invested', 'competitors', 'too', 'hate', 'reality', 'TV', 'sometimes', 'in-house', 'politics', 'annoying', 'once', 'get', 'out', 'range', 'display', 'skill', 'crap', 'disappears', 'while', ""'d"", 'say', 'split', 'pretty', 'even', 'show', 'goofy', 'reality', 'TV', 'stuff', 'other', 'half', 'shooting', 'while', 'more', 'annoying', 'ones', 'go', 'away', ""'re"", 'left', 'group', 'guys', 'girl', 'can', 'really', 'respect.Essentially', ""'re"", 'weapons', 'enthusiast', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'just', 'love', 'good', 'show', 'skill', 'Top', 'Shot', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Definitely', 'low', 'price', 'Amazon']",N/A

It's a reality show that for once, doesn't feel as though it's scripted. There's no love stories, little to no family drama, etc. It just straight up about shooting weapons and who does it best. The twist is that the team (there are 2) that loses has to vote for 2 of it's members to go to what's called an ""elimination challenge"", where they both have to compete against each other. The winner stays and goes back to the team, the loser goes home.What makes this show so unique is it's not all about rifles and handguns, but about a vast number of other weapons that the teams members may have never even shot before, like bows, vintage handguns and rifles, the bowie knife and more. The contestants either learn how to shoot/throw these weapons quickly, or they end up in last place and risk being sent home.Top Shots is an entertaining competition show that is age appropriate for anyone (family friendly content) with a reality show twist on it.

Each episode features one or more weapon, usually rifles and pistols, in a grueling marksmanship competition.  There is drama and intrigue, since during each round the losing team must select two of its members who then must compete against one another in the elimination round, and the loser goes home.This is excellent entertainment that spotlights the honored skill of marksmanship.

The contestants are recognized marksmen (&women), the program is set up with great quality and the photography is fabulous- lots of great slo-mo. It IS about shooting & the clever challenges. A minor part is about the relationships of shooters- JUST enough to engage a balance. HISTORY CHANNEL did a GREAT job with this show. Have watched every episode except a few in Season 3...
