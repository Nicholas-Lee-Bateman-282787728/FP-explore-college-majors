The first half of the movie is just the best and is handled like an Alfred Hitchcock thriller with excellent camera work and  mood.  It centers around a mute make-up artist who is assisting a film crew  shooting a horror movie in a Moscow studio.  While there she is witness to  a brutal murder of a prostitute at the hands of some who are making a snuff  movie.  From that moment, suspense abounds with each frame of the movie.  There is some unevenness with the script, but overlook that because you are  in for one hell of a rollercoaster thrill ride.  This was never in wide  release and that was a real shame.  Originality never looked this good!",4,Be prepared to bite your nails to the quick,915408000,"01 4, 1999",1999,745,"['Mute', 'Witness', 'story', 'times', 'confusing', 'suspense', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'just', 'best', 'handled', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'thriller', 'excellent', 'camera', 'work', 'mood', 'mute', 'make-up', 'artist', 'who', 'assisting', 'film', 'crew', 'shooting', 'horror', 'movie', 'Moscow', 'studio', 'witness', 'brutal', 'murder', 'prostitute', 'hands', 'who', 'are', 'making', 'snuff', 'movie', 'moment', 'suspense', 'abounds', 'frame', 'movie', 'unevenness', 'script', 'overlook', 'are', 'one', 'hell', 'rollercoaster', 'thrill', 'ride', 'was', 'never', 'wide', 'release', 'was', 'real', 'shame', 'Originality', 'never', 'looked', 'good']",Mute Witness VHS

This was REALLY good.Plot/Setting: Moscow, After a day at the studio with her American filmmakers, a mute makeup effects artist witnesses what she thinks is a murder right before her eyes. After work shes alone in the building and thinking everyone is already gone, she then hears something, creeps around the corner and spies on 2 of the guys making a snuff movie and from there its a big twist and turn type of deal. She is hiding from the killers and running. Just as shes found, one her friends comes to look for her and finds her, and the police come. Then she has to prove to Russian police that it was a real murder,'the killers claimed it was staged' even though she is mute. She soon becomes the target of hired killers and she dosent know who to trust and it also involves some diskettes that were lost that get thrown into the mix. She thinks she can trust this one guy but isnt sure and you start to think if hes really with her or against her. The killers are nuts and cold blooded in this movie. The one wears a mask with a blank expression and a black silk stocking thing over his head. The opening scene had me believing what was going on was real and i was like wow, this is really screwed up. It had plot twists, real scares, horror, suspense and it keeps you on edge until the last scene. Filled with shocks, good acting. I definitely recommend this one. 4.5 stars.

In Moscow, a slasher film is being shoot at midnight in an old, decrepit studio (the setting is a plus for the movie, since in the 90s, Moscow had a reputation as an anything goes, mafia infested city). Billy, a mute make up artist (played very well by Marina Zudina, a beautiful Russian actress) accidentally witnesses a porno shoot there, done after hours, that soon turns into a real murder.

389519,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6303926746,C. O. DeRiemer,"[1, 1]","I watched this again and was impressed once more with what an effective and efficient job director Anthony Waller did on a low budget. It's a small scale scare movie that utilizes all the cliches lovingly. Because it has, in my opinion, a strong story line with a sympathetic heroine, it works.Evan Richards (Andy Clark) and his wife, Karen Hughes (Fay Ripley), have come to Russia to film a low budget horror movie on the cheap. They're using a cast of Russian actors and they're filming in what looks to be a huge, derelict warehouse/sound stage. Fay's sister, Billy Hughes (Marina Zudina), who is mute, is the makeup and props person. She gets stuck one evening in the place, can't call for help, and starts wandering around. She sees some light on the soundstage. As she gets closer, she realizes a porno movie is being filmed by a couple of the Russian crew using the props. Then she sees the porno movie turn into a snuff film as the actress is gruesomely slain on camera. Since she's mute, she can't scream, can't make a phone call for help and, of course, knocks over a chair so that the villians know they've been seen. The center of the movie is her staying ahead of the two bad guys as they search for her, using her skills and knowledge. The great, darkened warehouse is a terrific place for unexpected frights. The story line also involves a computer disc that contains data which will incriminate The Reaper, a shadowy and powerful crime czar played in a brief cameo by Alec Guinness.Mute Witness is a good film with a very good transfer. One of the amusing aspects is the way director Waller set up the story line to parallel his own making of this low-budget movie in Moscow using mostly Russsians. When you consider how John Carpenter and the Coen Brothers, among others, got started in much the same way with low budget scare 'ems, this movie holds up very well.",4,"A Clever, Low Budget Scare  'Em",1107907200,"02 9, 2005",2005,1880,"['watched', 'again', 'was', 'impressed', 'once', 'more', 'what', 'effective', 'efficient', 'job', 'director', 'Anthony', 'Waller', 'did', 'low', 'budget', 'small', 'scale', 'scare', 'movie', 'cliches', 'lovingly', 'opinion', 'strong', 'story', 'line', 'sympathetic', 'heroine', 'Richards', 'Andy', 'Clark', 'wife', 'Karen', 'Hughes', 'Fay', 'Ripley', 'have', 'come', 'Russia', 'film', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'movie', 'cheap', ""'re"", 'using', 'cast', 'Russian', 'actors', ""'re"", 'filming', 'what', 'be', 'huge', 'derelict', 'warehouse/sound', 'stage', 'Fay', 'sister', 'Billy', 'Hughes', 'Marina', 'Zudina', 'who', 'mute', 'makeup', 'props', 'person', 'stuck', 'one', 'evening', 'place', 'ca', ""n't"", 'call', 'help', 'wandering', 'around', 'light', 'soundstage', 'closer', 'porno', 'movie', 'being', 'filmed', 'couple', 'Russian', 'crew', 'using', 'props', 'Then', 'porno', 'movie', 'turn', 'snuff', 'film', 'actress', 'gruesomely', 'slain', 'camera', 'mute', 'ca', ""n't"", 'scream', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'phone', 'call', 'help', 'course', 'chair', 'villians', 'know', ""'ve"", 'been', 'seen', 'center', 'movie', 'staying', 'ahead', 'two', 'bad', 'guys', 'search', 'using', 'skills', 'knowledge', 'great', 'darkened', 'warehouse', 'terrific', 'place', 'unexpected', 'frights', 'story', 'line', 'also', 'computer', 'disc', 'data', 'will', 'incriminate', 'Reaper', 'shadowy', 'powerful', 'crime', 'czar', 'played', 'brief', 'cameo', 'Alec', 'Guinness.Mute', 'Witness', 'good', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'transfer', 'One', 'amusing', 'aspects', 'way', 'director', 'Waller', 'set', 'up', 'story', 'line', 'parallel', 'own', 'making', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'Moscow', 'using', 'mostly', 'Russsians', 'When', 'consider', 'how', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'others', 'got', 'started', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'low', 'budget', 'scare', 'movie', 'up', 'very', 'well']",Mute Witness VHS

389522,A3L2U581LL17EB,6303926746,Eric,"[4, 5]","For the better part of an hour, Mute Witness is a first-rate thriller. So good, in fact, it was quickly becoming one of my genre favorites. Good premise, great direction, mostly terrific acting, smart writing, this one had it all. That is until just a bit past the one-hour mark, when the film suddenly makes a mind-boggling idiotic decision to change the tone and approach of the material, and it all devolves into a cheesy mess that left a sour taste in my mouth. This is the perfect example of a would-be great film that's merely recommendable thanks to an awful finish.Billy Hughes (Marina Zudina) is the make-up artist for a cheesy slasher flick being filmed in Russia. A quick intro shows us that she may be mute, but she's pretty good at her job, which she may have also gotten because her sister is married to the director. After shooting for the day is wrapped up, Billy stays behind and is accidentally locked inside the soundstage. Waiting for help to arrive, she stumbles upon two of the film's crew members shooting a porno film, which quickly becomes a snuff piece.After a fairly amusing opening scene and an effective set-up of the characters, Mute Witness kicks into full throttle quickly. Immediately after Billy witnesses the murder, we get one of the more suspenseful extended setpieces I've ever seen. These fifteen minutes consist of Billy creeping around the soundstage, desperately trying to avoid those crew members she just witnessed. It's a genuine breathtaking, edge-of-the-seat sequence, quite possibly the movie's highlight.But the fun's not over. A little over halfway through the picture, we get another great stalk-and-slash sequence inside Billy's apartment. You even get to see cutie Marina Zudina fully nude, in some of the more gratuitous bits of flesh baring I've seen in a while (to get the attention of a neighbor, she undoes her robe), not that I'm really complaining. Zudina is probably the best thing about the film, she's smart and likeable, a quick thinker who evades her attackers not because she's physically stronger or faster, but because she's smarter.(spoilers) While I figured the film couldn't possibly keep the momentum up, I wasn't expecting such a sharp turn of events, either. The film suddenly goes from edgy thriller to a cheesy spy film, packed with silly and predictable double-crosses and plot twists. The simplicity and stark atmosphere of the first hour is gone. The number of villains is bloated from two scary individuals to what is apparently the entire Russian mafia.The introduction of the undercover cop robs the movie of its key strength. The fun of the plot was watching Billy outthink and outsmart her attackers by herself. Bringing this guy into the mix shoves her into almost a supporting role and virtually reduces her to a mere sidekick/damsel in distress.Possibly worst of all is the decision to place Billy's sister and her husband into the thick of the action. I don't think I've ever seen such an extreme case of two characters who I initially liked that come to annoy me so much by the climax. These two are made into bumbling fools, they've basically become the film's comic relief. Attempts at humor include them accidentally killing the bad guys, dropping bullets in crucial situations, and generally acting as clumsy as possible but still somehow not getting themselves killed in the process.Director Anthony Waller had such a firm handle of the movie's pace and tone that I find it hard to believe he'd suddenly undo all his solid work in an instant. But the film's downward spiral is entirely his fault, the man wrote and directed the picture. He should have just stuck with what worked. But the first 2/3's are so much fun, it's worth recommending to thriller fans.",3,"Starts well, ends badly.",1073347200,"01 6, 2004",2004,3753,"['better', 'part', 'hour', 'Mute', 'Witness', 'first-rate', 'thriller', 'So', 'good', 'fact', 'was', 'quickly', 'becoming', 'one', 'genre', 'favorites', 'Good', 'premise', 'great', 'direction', 'mostly', 'terrific', 'acting', 'smart', 'writing', 'one', 'had', 'just', 'bit', 'one-hour', 'mark', 'when', 'film', 'suddenly', 'mind-boggling', 'idiotic', 'decision', 'change', 'tone', 'approach', 'material', 'cheesy', 'mess', 'left', 'sour', 'taste', 'mouth', 'perfect', 'example', 'would-be', 'great', 'film', 'merely', 'recommendable', 'thanks', 'awful', 'finish.Billy', 'Hughes', 'Marina', 'Zudina', 'make-up', 'artist', 'cheesy', 'slasher', 'flick', 'being', 'filmed', 'Russia', 'A', 'quick', 'intro', 'may', 'be', 'mute', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'may', 'have', 'also', 'gotten', 'sister', 'married', 'director', 'shooting', 'day', 'wrapped', 'up', 'Billy', 'accidentally', 'locked', 'soundstage', 'Waiting', 'help', 'arrive', 'two', 'film', 'crew', 'members', 'shooting', 'porno', 'film', 'quickly', 'snuff', 'piece.After', 'fairly', 'amusing', 'opening', 'scene', 'effective', 'set-up', 'characters', 'Mute', 'Witness', 'full', 'throttle', 'quickly', 'Immediately', 'Billy', 'murder', 'get', 'one', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'extended', 'setpieces', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'consist', 'Billy', 'creeping', 'soundstage', 'desperately', 'trying', 'avoid', 'crew', 'members', 'just', 'witnessed', 'genuine', 'breathtaking', 'edge-of-the-seat', 'sequence', 'quite', 'possibly', 'movie', 'fun', 'not', 'little', 'over', 'halfway', 'picture', 'get', 'great', 'stalk-and-slash', 'sequence', 'Billy', 'apartment', 'even', 'get', 'see', 'cutie', 'Marina', 'Zudina', 'fully', 'nude', 'more', 'gratuitous', 'bits', 'flesh', 'baring', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'get', 'attention', 'neighbor', 'robe', 'not', ""'m"", 'really', 'complaining', 'Zudina', 'probably', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'smart', 'likeable', 'quick', 'thinker', 'who', 'attackers', 'not', 'physically', 'stronger', 'faster', 'smarter', 'spoilers', 'figured', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'keep', 'momentum', 'up', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'such', 'sharp', 'turn', 'events', 'either', 'film', 'suddenly', 'edgy', 'thriller', 'cheesy', 'spy', 'film', 'packed', 'silly', 'predictable', 'double-crosses', 'plot', 'twists', 'simplicity', 'stark', 'atmosphere', 'first', 'hour', 'gone', 'number', 'villains', 'bloated', 'two', 'scary', 'individuals', 'what', 'apparently', 'entire', 'Russian', 'mafia.The', 'introduction', 'undercover', 'cop', 'robs', 'movie', 'key', 'strength', 'fun', 'plot', 'was', 'watching', 'Billy', 'outthink', 'outsmart', 'attackers', 'Bringing', 'guy', 'mix', 'almost', 'supporting', 'role', 'virtually', 'mere', 'sidekick/damsel', 'distress.Possibly', 'worst', 'decision', 'place', 'Billy', 'sister', 'husband', 'thick', 'action', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'extreme', 'case', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'initially', 'liked', 'come', 'annoy', 'so', 'much', 'climax', 'two', 'are', 'made', 'bumbling', 'fools', ""'ve"", 'basically', 'become', 'film', 'comic', 'relief', 'Attempts', 'humor', 'include', 'accidentally', 'killing', 'bad', 'guys', 'dropping', 'bullets', 'crucial', 'situations', 'generally', 'acting', 'as', 'clumsy', 'possible', 'still', 'somehow', 'not', 'getting', 'killed', 'process.Director', 'Anthony', 'Waller', 'had', 'such', 'firm', 'handle', 'movie', 'pace', 'tone', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', ""'d"", 'suddenly', 'undo', 'solid', 'work', 'instant', 'film', 'downward', 'spiral', 'entirely', 'fault', 'man', 'wrote', 'directed', 'picture', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'stuck', 'what', 'worked', 'first', '2/3', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'worth', 'recommending', 'thriller', 'fans']",Mute Witness VHS

Although its premise is not that unlike ""Wait Until Dark,"" it winds the whole thing up in a new way to make the suspense even more unnerving.Don't let the poster art mislead you. There is noone in this film with their lips sewn shut. The ""mute"" in this film is a female special effects expert on a low budget film. Having been born mute but not deaf, she can function almost perfectly in normal society. Of course we know that she is going to be delivered all sorts of frightful things, but what's the big deal? The big deal is she is part of a low budget film company shooting a horror film in Moscow...Russia. What if you were mute and couldn't convey your desires except in sign language?Our lead (mute) character, Billie, witnesses a murder...and the murderer discovers this fact.

The two of them are working on a slasher film being made in Moscow. After a long day of filming, Billy has forgotten something on location. When she goes back to get it, she stumbles upon what looks like a snuff film being made by some of the nastier elements of the crew. They discover her spying and pursue her, but she gets away and comes back with the cops. The crew dismiss it as a good piece of special effects, and it seems everyone's willing to let the matter rest, but Billy suspects her life may be in danger. How to convince both the American portion of the crew and the police that there's a real problem here?Tense, well-done, and expertly shot, Mute Witness is a perfect film for when you're looking for a good thriller, and one you probably haven't seen before. It's also worth noting that this is the final feature in which Sir Alec Guinness appeared, though Waller shot the footage back in 1985 (for an earlier draft of the movie that was never completed). As with most mysteries of this stripe, there are a few places where it really stretches credibility, and some character decisions that can generously be described as idiotic, but by now we've come to expect that, and you can't count it too much against this.

The girl on the cover isn't in the film, and at no point in the movie do any of the the characters have their mouths sewn shut. I understand that the image is figurative, but this type of ""stock"" photography isn't necessary for a movie with such rich plot elements and stark, arresting visuals.That aside, ""Mute Witness"" literally scared the hell out of me one night when I was up late watching TV. I don't want to synopsize the film here, suffice to say that it seems to start out as a black comedy about people making a slasher film, and turns very unexpectedly into a nightmarish movie that is so suspenseful in parts that some of the white-knuckle sequences are literally hard to watch. Not because they were handled in bad taste but because the first half of this movie is so masterfully handled by the ensemble that you feel you really are there and in jeopardy yourself. Having the protagonist be a mute (who can hear) was a genius touch for this genre. She can see everything, she can hear everything, but she can't scream or call for help! Just think of the hideous possibilities! And yet the film makers resist exploiting the more lurid potential of the sometimes highly delicate subject matter, favoring Hitchcock-like use of suspense AS torture.The result is a minor classic. I guess it would have been asking too much for ""Mute Witness"" to sustain the brilliant atmosphere and perfect timing of it's elaborate set-up. The second half of the film is saved by the convincing performance of Marina Zudina in the lead, and the performances of its equally convincing--and eerily restrained--bad guys. (I hate to point fingers, but it's really the Evan Richards slasher-film director that throws the tone out of whack--he seems to be in a TV sitcom while everyone else is in a big-screen suspense drama.)  As well, there are a few scenes of good-guy-rises up-against-bad-guy carnage that stretch plausibility to the breaking point, with unintentionally (I think) comic results.""Mute Witness"" remains however--despite some setbacks--a film that none the less entertains til the last shot. It may not fulfill the brilliant promise of its first half, but it's still great fun.

O'Blenis,"[10, 11]","With possibly more twists than any other horror/suspense movie in history - including ""Psycho"" and ""Raising Cain"", with possibly its only competion for the rapid twists crown coming from ""Paranoiac"" - ""Mute Witness"" is a wholly original and wholly unpredictable terror thrill ride that demands close attention from the viewer to keep up.A small movie crew is on location in Moscow filming a horror movie when a mute girl - a member of the crew - witnesses what appears to be a real murder, possibly connected with some sort of real-life snuff movie outfit operating in the Russian criminal underworld.  The Russian police - made up primarily of former-KGB agents - are called in and, although I'm well aware of the garbage that went down in the years when Stalin et al had the KGB committing their atrocities, the simple fact is that not All of the hundreds of thousands of men and women working in Soviet law enforcement could have been bad, it's statisically impossible, and it's an interesting and refreshing change to see these ex-KGBers presented in the 'good guy' role for a change.  The lead investigator in particular is impressive - both the character and the actor.  Though highly skeptical of the murder account given, he's compassionate with the young girl terrified by what she thinks she saw, totally non-patronizing, and highly efficient.  The actor who plays him impresses hugely because before the movie he apparantly spoke virtually no English and taught himself enough in the few weeks before auditions to not only land the part but to give a tremendous performance, thus fitting in well with the high-caliber jobs done by all the actors and actresses involved.  Speaking of refreshing, although the filmakers are all ardent horror enthusiasts making a horror movie, ""Mute Witness"" does not try for laughs by making them all, er... idiots, to be blunt... because they like horror (i.e. this is not ""Scream"" or similar 'spoof'-fare, which I know a lot of people love but I've never been able to get into).  There Is humor in the movie, but it derives from less feeble sources, and it works, in spite of the intensity of the movie.What I've said so far gives a rundown of only the early going of the movie.  There are so many twists and turns that to go further would risk spoiling some of the surprises.

389536,A1BD0IDVL32T2B,6303926746,"yorgos dalman ""yorgos dalman""","[13, 14]","""Mute witness"" starts with a very funny take on low budget filmmaking, then offers a horriffic snuff-murder, followed by a cat and mouse game between a witness and the killer in a huge, abandoned building, then does some tiresome B-plot things with a important floppydisc which multiple parties are looking for, then goes for a shoot-out with a twist, and ends, finaly, with a bang.Okay, for some explanation: a crew of Young Americans is making a slasher movie in Russia. What they don't know is that part of the Russian technicians are using the same sets at night to produce pornografic snuff. Billy, the mute special effects girl, is present by accident, and what follows is a chase through the building complex, which is so extremely well made and done, that even the chase-scenes in ""Dressed to kill"" and ""Se7en"" have to ""snuff it"".Scene after scene, moment after moment, the killers close in on Billy, and with only her wit she manages to stay ahead. The whole sequence is done with great amount of detail and feel for true suspense and keeps the viewer on the very edge of his seat.But when Billy is rescued from the bad guys, they track her down to her appartment. And again we're plagued with another hand full of topnotch suspense. Billy takes a quiet bath, and even this innocent scene is so put together and we, as the viewer, hold our breath in vein. And it only gets worse after this.""Mute witness"" can be put in the same spot as ""Saw"", ""The Evil dead"", ""Cube"", ""Pi"", ""Halloween"" and ""Memento"": all made by an enthusiastic group of young new talent, whose excitements are clearly visable all throughout the movies they made. This new bunch of talent, wit and exictement makes up for half a Great Movie, their craftmanship for the other half.",4,"She can't scream, but we will...",1152403200,"07 9, 2006",2006,1756,"['Mute', 'witness', 'very', 'funny', 'take', 'low', 'budget', 'filmmaking', 'then', 'horriffic', 'snuff-murder', 'followed', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'witness', 'killer', 'huge', 'abandoned', 'building', 'then', 'tiresome', 'B-plot', 'things', 'important', 'floppydisc', 'multiple', 'parties', 'are', 'looking', 'then', 'shoot-out', 'twist', 'finaly', 'bang.Okay', 'explanation', 'crew', 'Young', 'Americans', 'making', 'slasher', 'movie', 'Russia', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'part', 'Russian', 'technicians', 'are', 'using', 'same', 'sets', 'night', 'produce', 'pornografic', 'snuff', 'Billy', 'mute', 'special', 'effects', 'girl', 'present', 'accident', 'what', 'chase', 'building', 'complex', 'so', 'extremely', 'well', 'made', 'done', 'even', 'chase-scenes', 'Dressed', 'kill', 'Se7en', 'have', 'snuff', '.Scene', 'scene', 'moment', 'moment', 'killers', 'close', 'Billy', 'only', 'wit', 'stay', 'ahead', 'whole', 'sequence', 'done', 'great', 'amount', 'detail', 'feel', 'true', 'suspense', 'viewer', 'very', 'edge', 'seat.But', 'when', 'Billy', 'rescued', 'bad', 'guys', 'track', 'down', 'appartment', 'again', ""'re"", 'plagued', 'hand', 'full', 'topnotch', 'suspense', 'Billy', 'quiet', 'bath', 'even', 'innocent', 'scene', 'so', 'put', 'together', 'viewer', 'hold', 'breath', 'vein', 'only', 'worse', 'Mute', 'witness', 'can', 'be', 'put', 'same', 'spot', 'Saw', 'Evil', 'dead', 'Cube', 'Pi', 'Halloween', 'Memento', 'made', 'enthusiastic', 'group', 'young', 'new', 'talent', 'excitements', 'are', 'clearly', 'visable', 'movies', 'made', 'new', 'bunch', 'talent', 'wit', 'exictement', 'up', 'Great', 'Movie', 'craftmanship', 'other', 'half']",Mute Witness VHS
