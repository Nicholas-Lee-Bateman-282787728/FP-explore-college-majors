I am kinda surprised this thriller is directed by Curtis Hanson, doesn't seem like his type of movie.

313031,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302450187,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","The same year that `Single White Female' was released, this variant of the genre featuring Rebecca De Mornay in a `Fatal Attraction' type role came bursting into theaters.  It is very dated, feels more 80's than 90's and flatlines with a completely phoned in lead performance, and yet it is all so very entertaining.The film tells the story of two young women affected tremendously by the malpractice of a gynecologist.  Claire Bartel is pregnant with her second child when her doctor molests her.  Her complaint against him causes him to commit suicide and the stress causes his pregnant wife to have a miscarriage.  So, the scorned widow dons a new name (Peyton Flanders) and squeezes herself into Claire's life when she applies to be their nanny.  She sets her plan into motion in order to take over Claire's life, which means breastfeeding her son and gaining her daughter's love and devotion and even trying to advance on her husband by forming cracks in their marriage.  She is nearly effective, but her plans are soured by the strength of Claire's devotion to her family.It is scary in scenes and works as a whole to produce an entertaining scenario.  That said, the finale is a tad over-reaching and De Mornay's performance is so skeletal (seriously, why is she acting like a teenager?) that it takes away from the impact of the film.  Matt McCoy turns in a TERRIBLE performance and Sciorra just feels disheveled the whole time (and her asthmatic episodes feel very put on) but Julianne Moore is fantastic in her small role and Madeline Zima turns out a fantastic child performance.  I found the film very predictable, right down to the insightful mentally handicapped man who was predestined to become the family's savior the moment he appeared onscreen.Still, I liked it enough.",3,"It doesn't quite rock, but it works...",1358467200,"01 18, 2013",2013,1788,"['same', 'year', 'Single', 'White', 'Female', 'was', 'released', 'variant', 'genre', 'featuring', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'type', 'role', 'came', 'bursting', 'theaters', 'very', 'dated', 'feels', 'more', '80', '90', 'flatlines', 'completely', 'phoned', 'lead', 'performance', 'yet', 'so', 'very', 'entertaining.The', 'film', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'affected', 'tremendously', 'malpractice', 'gynecologist', 'Claire', 'Bartel', 'pregnant', 'second', 'child', 'when', 'doctor', 'complaint', 'commit', 'suicide', 'stress', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'have', 'miscarriage', 'So', 'scorned', 'widow', 'dons', 'new', 'name', 'Peyton', 'Flanders', 'Claire', 'life', 'when', 'be', 'nanny', 'plan', 'motion', 'order', 'take', 'over', 'Claire', 'life', 'breastfeeding', 'son', 'gaining', 'daughter', 'love', 'devotion', 'even', 'trying', 'advance', 'husband', 'forming', 'cracks', 'marriage', 'nearly', 'effective', 'plans', 'are', 'soured', 'strength', 'Claire', 'devotion', 'family.It', 'scary', 'scenes', 'whole', 'produce', 'entertaining', 'scenario', 'said', 'finale', 'tad', 'over-reaching', 'De', 'Mornay', 'performance', 'so', 'skeletal', 'seriously', 'why', 'acting', 'teenager', 'away', 'impact', 'film', 'Matt', 'McCoy', 'TERRIBLE', 'performance', 'Sciorra', 'just', 'feels', 'disheveled', 'whole', 'time', 'asthmatic', 'episodes', 'feel', 'very', 'put', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'fantastic', 'small', 'role', 'Madeline', 'Zima', 'out', 'fantastic', 'child', 'performance', 'found', 'film', 'very', 'predictable', 'right', 'down', 'insightful', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'predestined', 'become', 'family', 'savior', 'moment', 'appeared', 'liked', 'enough']",The Hand That Rocks the Cradle VHS
313032,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,6302450187,andy8047,"[1, 1]","Annabella Sciorra's film career was beginning to skyrocket when this film was theatrically released in January 1992. Her previous film credits include THE HARD WAY and CADILLAC MAN. She had a great role in the latter film. In this film,Sciorra is Claire Bartel who is searching for a nanny for her toddler daughter and her(Claire's) infant son. The hired nanny is Peyton Flanders(Rebecca DeMornay) who ends up trying to kill the baby. Peyton is the widow of Claire's physician Dr. Victor Mott. Peyton told Claire when they first met,that Peyton was once pregnant and miscarried around the time Dr. Mott was murdered. That scared her from having more children of her own. Before working for Claire and her engineer husband Michael(Matt McCoy),Peyton worked with one family who will be moving away and she didn't know where she'd go from there. Peyton overheard a conversation amongst a group of mommies,with one of them saying Claire needed a nanny. Ernie Hudson is Solomon,a black maintenance man who is good handling the baby also. Claire accused Dr. Mott of molesting her shortly before his murder. That's another reason why Peyton came along,seeking revenge. Peyton even releases the contents of Claire's breath machine(Claire suffers from asthma). The not-yet-famous Julianne Moore is Marlene Craven,a friend of the Bartels and an ex-girlfriend of Michael's.  Marlene goes out of her way to convince Claire that Peyton is ""poison"". Marlene ends up killed also,by falling window pane glass from the Bartels' greenhouse. There were points sharp enough to fatally stab. There was a scene in the 1990 film GHOST just like that. A guy was killed by falling window pane glass. Peyton ""rigged"" the greenhouse,planning to kill Claire. Also in another scene,Claire has a surprise birthday party(this was Peyton's idea). After learning that Peyton is ""poison"",Claire returns to the Bartels' home,punching Peyton out. After Peyton is thrown out,she returns armed and duels with Claire. Claire wins the duel,and Peyton rolls off the Bartels' roof from the attic,onto the ground,destroying the fence also.

313033,A2SPHTIPK9IKDQ,6302450187,Anony Mous,"[0, 0]","The acting, directing, and writing are superb, especially De Mornay's performance of vengeful malevolence as the character Payton . I've never seen her act this well. The story becomes scarrier by the moment, and you keep wondering what she will do next to destroy Claire (Annabella Sciorra), the person she turns her revenge on for causing her husband to commit suicide and herself to miscarriage from the shock. The suspense keeps escalating. The writer has deftly planted the clues that will enable annabelle to finally figure out that her nanny (De Mornay)is the personification of pure evil.I would have given this film five stars if the writer had established a believable background for Peyton so that Claire and her husband Michael would have had a solid basis for hiring her as a nanny for their young daughter and the coming baby. No matter how charming a nanny is, anyone who reads and watches the news, or views some of the Dateline and CBS news mysteries, knows that first impressions can often be misleading. 99.9% of  persons would have asked Peyton for some checkable references--people who could vouch for her character and ability to care for children--and then checked them. But this was not done, setting the rest of the story on an unbelievable foundation. The writer should have had Peyton establish some kind of a reputation--even if done with a false resume and false letters of reccomendation and a few sympathetic friends to back her up.Notwithstanding, I highly reccommend this thriller.",4,Great Revenge Thriller,1244937600,"06 14, 2009",2009,1514,"['acting', 'directing', 'writing', 'are', 'superb', 'especially', 'De', 'Mornay', 'performance', 'vengeful', 'malevolence', 'character', 'Payton', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'act', 'well', 'story', 'scarrier', 'moment', 'keep', 'wondering', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'next', 'destroy', 'Claire', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'person', 'revenge', 'causing', 'husband', 'commit', 'suicide', 'miscarriage', 'shock', 'suspense', 'keeps', 'escalating', 'writer', 'deftly', 'planted', 'clues', 'will', 'enable', 'annabelle', 'finally', 'figure', 'out', 'nanny', 'De', 'Mornay', 'personification', 'pure', 'evil.I', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'writer', 'had', 'established', 'believable', 'background', 'Peyton', 'Claire', 'husband', 'Michael', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'solid', 'basis', 'hiring', 'nanny', 'young', 'daughter', 'coming', 'baby', 'matter', 'how', 'charming', 'nanny', 'anyone', 'who', 'news', 'Dateline', 'CBS', 'news', 'mysteries', 'first', 'impressions', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'misleading', '99.9', '%', 'persons', 'would', 'have', 'asked', 'Peyton', 'checkable', 'references', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'vouch', 'character', 'ability', 'care', 'children', 'then', 'checked', 'was', 'not', 'done', 'setting', 'rest', 'story', 'unbelievable', 'foundation', 'writer', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'Peyton', 'establish', 'kind', 'reputation', 'even', 'done', 'false', 'resume', 'false', 'letters', 'reccomendation', 'few', 'sympathetic', 'friends', 'back', 'up.Notwithstanding', 'highly', 'reccommend', 'thriller']",The Hand That Rocks the Cradle VHS
313034,AE8RQHFMSLN0D,6302450187,"Anthony Damato ""Law professor""","[6, 11]","You start with a great script, assemble a top cast, a good  cinematographer, a reasonable budget, and what possibly could go wrong?  Well, it all goes wrong after the picture is filmed.  It goes to the  editing department.  A musical score is plugged in that makes you wince  with pain--it takes the beautiful &quot;Poor Wandering One&quot; by Gilbert  &amp; Sullivan and plays it lugubriously over the opening credits, getting  one of the notes wrong and one of the important chords wrong.  Thus,  instead of a bittersweet tune (which the adapter may have wanted), it turns  into a sophomoric howler.  But that's just for starters.  What really goes  wrong in the editing process is that the editor was out to lunch.  No  sensitivity for pacing.  The movie plods along.  The editor killed it,  stuffing it with scenes that take too long and characterizations that were  obvious minutes ago--as if the stupid audience needs more time to let it  all &quot;sink in.&quot;  What a waste of Hollywood creativity!  Maybe the  editor fought with the director, and maybe it was really the director's  fault, though I personally believe that the person who has final cut is the  most important person in most movies, and here the final cut was an  abomination.  This might be one of those rare films that work better on TV  with commercial breaks.  The commercials would dull your sensibilities, and  you can pick up with the film afterwards, and settle into it at the languid  pace the editor chose.  But on DVD, which is how I just viewed it, it's a  movie that shoots itself in the foot.  Every element that was necessary for  an outstanding movie was there, but it was ruined after the actors and  directors and camerapersons went home.  Nevertheless, with all of the  post-production mediocrity, we still have a very fine screenplay, fine  acting, and an entertaining movie.

313037,A3V4WA7SI8JUJR,6302450187,"Bradley O'brien ""Knight of the Woeful Contenance""","[3, 5]","There were many facets of the film which made me ask ""Would that happen today?"" Peyton showed up and was I guess more or less hired on the spot. Most folks would presumably say ""Well, we'll discuss your resume and prior experience and get back to you with our final decision.."" yet we see Peyton Flanders (Mrs Mott) hired right away. I think most Americans would have just hired a Mexican gal, probably at half the salary paid to Peyton. Perhaps Peyton's character today could have been a Hispanic woman (the gorgeous Eva Longoria comes to mind) who merely pretended to be illegal.Not ever having hired a nanny I assume that a full-blown criminal background check would be done just as it is for day care staff or school bus drivers/cafeteria workers/custodians.When Peyton (Mrs Mott) is in the hospital after her miscarriage and total hysterectomy she looks up to see the woman who initiated the complaint against her late husband. I dont think today accusers have their image in the news (think of the Kobe Bryant rape case) so Peyton would not have seen the woman she blamed for the suicide of Dr Mott. The story line doesnt reveal much about how much Peyton loved her late husband. It might have made the character more interesting to have this miscarriage not be her first. Late in the film--as Claire sees the nursery room of Peyton's now repossessed home-- we learn that even after her miscarriage and hysterectomy Peyton evidently continued pumping her breasts to ""keep her milk up"". It might have made for more realism if there could have been a scene with Peyton showing up with a leak on her blouse, or perhaps Claire could have found a breast pad among Peyton's personal affects.A gynecologist or endocrinologist would have to confirm whether a woman who underwent complete hysterectomy would even be able to lactate that many months post operatively.The scene wherein we see Peyton wake up at 3am and quietly sneak into baby Joel's nursery room was perhaps the most emotional. When Peyton first picks up the pillow from the rocker you envision her suffocating the infant (and perhaps letting the grieving family believe it was from SIDS) instead she does what seems to be an outwardly loving act, straight out of a La Leche League PSA! Its only as the film progresses and we see Peyton's manipulation of Emma that the breast-feeding is seen as a way to subvert the infant's bond with his real mother. A backseat breast feed is inferred from the scene where Claire is franticly searching the contents of her purse for Michael's grant proposal. Claire is of course later concerned when her baby isnt nursing as often or as long as previously.Ernie Hudson's innocent handyman is the only one capable of seeing the evil behind Peyton's charade.

It taps into the suburban nightmare of a deranged nanny who tries to 'steal' a family.Young housewife Claire Bartel (played by Annabella Sciorra) is thrust into a nightmare situation when her new doctor's medical procedures border on indecent assault.  She files a complaint, and opens the way for other women to speak up about his malpractice.  Shortly before he's due in court to explain his actions, he commits suicide, and Claire resumes her life.Enter Peyton Flanders (played with chilling conviction by Rebecca DeMornay).  She's a young nanny with no job, and Claire's busy raising two small children whilst building a new greenhouse.  The situation couldn't be more perfect...or more sinister.  While Peyton worms her way into the Bartel household, she hides a secret plan of revenge to bump Claire out of the family portrait for good!Sciorra and DeMornay duke it out in grand style in THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE, which features enough sickening suspense and fabulous thrills to hook even the most remote audience.

Peyton does everything she can to make Claire's life unpleasant - feeding her baby with her own breast milk so that it rejects Claire's; trying to seduce Michael and claiming he is having an affair with one of their close friends, Marlene Craven (Julianne Moore).

Claire Bartel (Annabella Sciorra) is given this warning after hiring nanny Petyon Flanders (Rebecca DeMornay), but she doesn't heed the warning.  And so, we get this battle between two women over who gets to rule over Claire's family.Caught in this tug-of-war is Claire's husband, their daughter, Claire's friend (the one who issued the warning), and Claire's housekeeper, who's also mentally challenged.Although this movie is suspenseful, it had some holes in it like:-- How could an obstetrician molest a patient if a nurse is always present during an exam?  Perhaps, though, back then this rule hadn't gone into effect yet.  It's possible.-- Who would hire a nanny (who's not a family member) who didn't come from an agency?  Especially one that Claire meets off the street?  Wouldn't she have checked with the family the nanny said she worked with first?-- Wouldn't Claire have immediately been alarmed that her baby wasn't eating at all?  I mean, this wasn't her first child, so wouldn't she know by now what's normal behavior for a baby?-- It looked like the nanny left the torn envelope in the bathroom stall, so if Claire worked there, wouldn't she have spotted it?-- Who leaves out a breast pump when you're trying to sell a home?-- I also thought it was silly when Claire gets perfume over her dress, the only other dress she has available is a dowdy, floral dress.-- I also thought it was unrealistic that the husband could fall off a railing onto his head (not his body, but his head) and yet, still be able to hold an intelligent conversation with his wife.It was these oddities that made the film seem implausible and pulled me out of the story.  What also pulled me out of the story was Annabella Sciorra's acting.  She came across as flat sometimes.I also thought the acting by the mentally challenged housekeeper unconvincing, too.  It seemed like he thought all he had to do was stutter and say his lines slowly and that would be enough to convince us his character was mentally challenged.

313057,AIOXMENE1HBR7,6302450187,GreatMovieCriticRobertfromUS,"[0, 0]","""The hand that rocks the cradle"" from 1992 and by Hollywood pictures was a great movie. i remembered it did create a buzz when it came out. the performances were good, but what really got it attention was this vile and almost mesmerizing character of peyton flanders (rebecca mornay). an over the edge psycho who wants to get revenge on one family because of a miscarriage she suffered over the fact that her husband , dr. mott (john de lancie) has been found guilty of sexually foundling his own patients.Of course dr. mott has dr. mott has had a long history of doing this and his wife knows about it. however his dark secret is exposed by claire bartel (annabella sciorra) who while pregnant gets some unwanted sexually advances by the good old dr.Bartel then is pointed as the first woman to come out as one of the dr. victim's and this causes a domino effect where other victims come of the closet to talk about the dr. the dr's games are over , however he can't deal with the fact that he has been exposed and going to prison, so he commits suicide (via a gunshot).Peyton (mornay) loses their baby in the process and when she finds out miss bartel was the first victim to speak out she does what any typical psycho would do, she targets her for her revenge. the expression ""hell on wheels"" definitely applies here.  Peyton's character is quite a sight for sore eyes, i haven't seen a psychotic character like this since glenn close's alex character in fatal attraction.However, peyton doesn't launch an obvious assault on claire. no she's schemes to get into the family and then killing clare by posing as a nanny for hire in the family.She then sets up the situation to get hired by making it look like the baby of the Bartel's is choking and thus saving her life. Pathetic. However the Bartels, Clare and Michael (Matt Mccoy) laughingly fall for the lies of Peyton despite the fact that she isn't whom she claims to be but then again the Bartel family is such a naive family that they are easily pluckings for Peyton's revenge.For instance, Peyton is hired to be the ""nanny"" even though, she admits she wasn't sent by a nanny agency , she doesn't have clear cut references, and Marlena Craven (Clare's friend) doesn't like her one bit.That about sums the movie itself in a way. It seems several characters are either too dumb or too naive to see what's going and this in turn leads to the disastrous things that happen at the hands of Peyton.For example it seems that Clare has a sort of asthma problem and she must take her pills. Well one day, Michael (Matt Mccoy) must turn in an important proposal to his company. Clare volunteers to do it, but when her back is turned, Peyton hides the proposal thus ensuring some problems in the marriage of the Bartels. The stress caused on Clare causes her to have several asthma attacks yet she doesn't see that Peyton is responsible despite the warnings from Marlena or the obvious advances Peyton is making toward Michael. Yes that's right Peyton ever the home-wrecker tries to make sexual advances toward this gullible guy to break up the family.Add further insult the other person who doesn't believe Peyton's nanny character is who she claims is Solomon (Ernie Hudson from Ghostbusters and Oz). Solomon is a black man who is mentally challenged, yet despite this Solomon has the intelligence to realize Peyton is a psycho. However, Peyton before Solomon has a chance to discuss his suspicions of her, gets rid of Solomon, thus leaving the Bartel family once again an easy target for her.LOL I made it sound like a soap opera.

313065,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,6302450187,Jonathan Appleseed,"[4, 5]","In 1992, when the movie was released to theaters, I was pleasantly surprised by a thriller that was filmed nearly entirely in the daytime with very little happening during darkness or rain. There were no tricks here, as there have been in so many similar films. This was the real thing, and you know that the directors and producers had that in mind. If they didn't, well, they were just lucky - but that's not likely.Watching it again tonight, fourteen years later, I did find some flaws in a film that I recall adoring. They were slight flaws, however. The biggest of these was the elaborate trap that De Mornay's character set for Claire in the greenhouse. Seriously - any incompetent police officer (well before any detective would have arrived) would have seen the delicate apparatus that caused the glass to fall, or at least put one and one together upon finding bits and pieces of the apparatus. When I first saw the film, I thought that was a remarkable scene. Fourteen years later, and fourteen years older, I found it unrealistic. And realism in art (movies, books, etc.) is essential. If it's not realistic, it's impossible to believe.Even the setup for the ""greenhouse attack"" was a bit off. It encompassed Claire's husband Mike having a first love, Marlene, and he spent an evening with her having cocktails and smoking a few cigarettes. Perhaps actors/producers/directors all smoke and so don't quite get the dichotomy here. You smoke, you stink. You're in a bar with smoke, you stink. If you're not, you don't. That's the dichotomy. If Michael returned from the bar he was at, Marlene would have known it three seconds after he entered their bedroom (where she was reading). The cig smoke, from him, Marlene, and other patrons of the bar, would have caused his clothing to absolutely REEK, which is all the more noticeable to a person that's been in a smoke-free bedroom for several hours.

Though isn't that the arboretum from San Francisco's Golden Gate Park standing in for Claire's workplace?  We saw this when it first came out, and viewing it again you get sucked right back in, due to a potent combination of fine writing, horrid yet efficient writing, and a handful of strong performances.  Little Madeline Zima puts our present day diva, Dakota Fanning to shame, with some quiet, subtle work worthy of the juvenile Oscar--if only the Academy still issued them!  Whatever happened to Madeline Zima?  She must be 21 by now, I wonder if she's still working or did the trauma of working with Rebecca de Mornay drive her away from acting?  With her big eyes and timid smile, Zima is outstanding as a child trapped in a manipulative relationship with a psychopathic nanny (Rebecca de Mornay).  We see how easily Peyton, the nanny, is able to deflect the little girl's love away from her real mother, just by pushing the right buttons.What to make of the Ernie Hudson character?  Hudson is absolutely terrific, and has never again been used so well, but the whole ""black retarded friend who adores the white family"" thing leaves a bad taste in the viewers' mouth.  I don't really care for being politically correct, but the scene where the Bartel family gives him a new bicycle might well have been considered old hat even in the heyday of DW Griffith.  At the end of the movie I wanted him to stand back and let Peyton destroy Annabella Sciorra, that would have served her right.The music scoring I found very beautiful.  The composer managed to find exactly the right aria, Arthur Sullivan's ""Poor Wand'ring One"" (from THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE) to express something of Peyton's fragile mental state--and to let us discover that, beneath the malice, trembles a frightened and abandoned soul.  Claire keeps playing this track over and over as though unaware that a real-life ""wandring one"" was under her roof.  Later, at the very end, this music is used to underscore Ernie Hudson's last scene.  You almost feel that the music knows more about the solitary and the traumatic than the director ever dreamed of.Julianne Moore looks like an anorexic in her exquisite, chic and expensive outfits.  I wonder why the screenwriters didn't think of a plot in which she and Matt McCoy ARE actually having an affair, which Peyton finds out about and uses against them?  As it stands the story rests on a mass of unconvincing coincidences.  How on earth could Peyton arrange it so that Claire and Julianne Moore would go out on a girl date together on the very afternoon of the evening in which Moore and McCoy are planning a surprise birthday party?  But without that, there's no way her plot could have worked.  Oh well!  And as another reviewer has noted, Annabella Sciorrs, dimwitted throughout the whole first part of the movie, has a brilliant flash of deduction at the end which makes hash out of her characterization.  Visiting Dr. Mott's house, she does more than put two and two together--she puts one together.  Then she races home and slaps Rebecca De Mornay across the floor.

As soon as Peyton settles in, she begins the slow and deliberate seduction and destruction of Sciorra's family, with the ultimate goal of stealing both husband and children away from the woman she considers responsible for the destruction of her own life.Peyton is, ironically, a somewhat sympathetic character, who seems more dynamic than Sciorra's mousy Claire, at least until she starts to spit venom as her carefully constructed fantasy world begins to collapse.The best thing about THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE is DeMornay herself, who moves from shyness and gentleness to brazenness and cruelty with an ease that is really disturbing.

It is disappointing that the 1.85:1 widescreen DVD is not enhanced for 16:9 TVs. The picture is of average quality and the audio is average.,4,The Hand That Rocks the Cradle DVD Review,1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,387,"['Hand', 'Cradle', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'convincing', 'performances', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'lovely', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'fine', 'job', 'playing', 'vicious', 'nanny', 'film', 'also', 'fine', 'score', 'Graeme', 'Revell', 'disappointing', '1.85:1', 'widescreen', 'DVD', 'not', 'enhanced', '16:9', 'TVs', 'picture', 'average', 'quality', 'audio', 'average']",The Hand That Rocks the Cradle VHS

May be that to some viewers the plot is quite predictable... well it wasn't for me! I just seat at the edge of my couch for more than half the movie.The story is as follows: a recently pregnant woman pays a visit to the obstetrician and discovers that there is a new doctor there. Dr. Mott starts a check-up that ends in sexual molestation to Claire.When she returns home she shares her anguish with Michael, her husband. They decide to denounce Dr. Mott.From here on a series of dreadful events are triggered: Dr. Mott commits suicide unable to stand other patients denounces, his pregnant widow learns she's broken and have a spontaneous abort.Some months later the Bartels are enjoying their newborn and Michael convinces Claire to hire a live-in nanny allowing her to have free time for her occupations. After discarding some applicants, Claire, ""casually"" meets the ""perfect nanny"":  Peyton Flanders, who's actually Dr. Mott's widow seeking revenge.Little by little Peyton will disrupt Bartels' domestic life creating havoc amongst them, expelling the gardener, arousing jealousies, emotionally separating Claire from her young daughter and trying to seduce Michael. All this performed with reckless duplicity.Tension and violence increases arriving to a hair-raising final scene.Rebecca De Mornay as the hideous nanny gives an outstanding performance. I was particularly surprised by the economy of gestures she gives and yet transmits to the viewer all the volcanic passion of her sentiments.Ernie Hudson as the mentally impaired gardener gives an over par performance.Last but not least Robert Elwit's photography, especially home interiors, is very good.Thumbs up for this movie!Reviewed by Max Yofre.",5,"Nanny, Nanny Hating Bright!",1152230400,"07 7, 2006",2006,2025,"['Director', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'filmed', 'many', 'remarkable', 'films', 'LA', 'Confidential', '1997', 'most', 'awarded', 'film', '8', 'Mile', '2002', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Shoes', '2005', 'very', 'successful', 'incursion', 'Family', 'Conflict', 'genre', 'movie', 'Hand', 'Rock', 'Cradle', '1992', 'dramatic', 'thriller', 'full', 'adrenalin', 'May', 'be', 'viewers', 'plot', 'quite', 'predictable', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'seat', 'edge', 'couch', 'more', 'movie.The', 'story', 'recently', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'visit', 'obstetrician', 'discovers', 'new', 'doctor', 'there', 'Dr.', 'Mott', 'check-up', 'sexual', 'molestation', 'Claire.When', 'home', 'shares', 'anguish', 'Michael', 'husband', 'decide', 'denounce', 'Dr.', 'Mott.From', 'here', 'series', 'dreadful', 'events', 'are', 'triggered', 'Dr.', 'Mott', 'commits', 'suicide', 'unable', 'stand', 'other', 'patients', 'denounces', 'pregnant', 'widow', 'broken', 'have', 'spontaneous', 'abort.Some', 'months', 'later', 'Bartels', 'are', 'enjoying', 'newborn', 'Michael', 'convinces', 'Claire', 'hire', 'live-in', 'nanny', 'allowing', 'have', 'free', 'time', 'occupations', 'discarding', 'applicants', 'Claire', 'casually', 'perfect', 'nanny', 'Peyton', 'Flanders', 'who', 'actually', 'Dr.', 'Mott', 'widow', 'seeking', 'revenge.Little', 'little', 'Peyton', 'will', 'disrupt', 'Bartels', 'domestic', 'life', 'creating', 'havoc', 'expelling', 'gardener', 'arousing', 'jealousies', 'emotionally', 'separating', 'Claire', 'young', 'daughter', 'trying', 'seduce', 'Michael', 'performed', 'reckless', 'duplicity.Tension', 'violence', 'increases', 'arriving', 'hair-raising', 'final', 'scene.Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'hideous', 'nanny', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'was', 'particularly', 'surprised', 'economy', 'gestures', 'yet', 'transmits', 'viewer', 'volcanic', 'passion', 'sentiments.Ernie', 'Hudson', 'mentally', 'impaired', 'gardener', 'par', 'performance.Last', 'not', 'least', 'Robert', 'Elwit', 'photography', 'especially', 'home', 'interiors', 'very', 'good.Thumbs', 'up', 'movie', 'Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",The Hand That Rocks the Cradle VHS
313084,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,6302450187,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[3, 8]","I seem to be watching a lot of my mum's movies at the moment (first Disclosure, now this), as to be honest, I'm getting a little bored with my DVDs. I need some fresh blood. Which isn't easy when you're limiting yourself to one DVD a week. So instead, I'll just dig around in my mum's DVD case.I've seen this movie a million and one times now, and I never get fed up of it. There aren't many well known actors, apart from Rebecca De Mornay, Ernie Hudson and Julianne Moore in a truly bitchy role. Madeline Zima also appears in a very annoying role - when her mother tells her to stay put, does she? Does she hell! She just has to get involved! I didn't recognise many of the actors in this, although they all did a fantastic job, especially Annabella Sciorra, who plays the part of an asthmatic mother (although, she doesn't catch on to the fact that all her inhalers stop working at the same time)Rebecca De Mornay & Ernie Hudson do brilliantly in this, as the psychotic nanny, and the mentally ill handyman respectively. Rebecca works the icy cold stare to the maximum, and almost looks evil towards the end of the movie, although she does sometimes have a certain childlike quality to her. Ernie is the only one to catch onto what she's really trying to do, although I do find her breastfeeding another woman's baby a little freaky. The movie shows a sensitivity to those with mental disabilities and doesn't exploit the mental illness simply for entertainment.Julianne Moore, in one of her first roles, looking surprisingly young, is a true saracastic little bitch in this, and I wish she'd had more screen time, as she was terrific. She also cottons on to the fact that Peyton the psychotic nanny isn't quite right.The whole film is brilliantly, although I can imagine some people not watching it, due to there being no ""big name stars"" in it. Well, no A-list celebrities in it. But if you see it cheaply, it's well worth watching, so go and abuse your credit card.",3,Ernie Hudson is the best bit about this movie,1092960000,"08 20, 2004",2004,1970,"['seem', 'be', 'watching', 'lot', 'mum', 'movies', 'moment', 'first', 'Disclosure', 'now', 'be', 'honest', ""'m"", 'getting', 'little', 'bored', 'DVDs', 'need', 'fresh', 'blood', 'Which', ""n't"", 'easy', 'when', ""'re"", 'limiting', 'one', 'DVD', 'week', 'So', 'instead', ""'ll"", 'just', 'dig', 'around', 'mum', 'DVD', 'case.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'million', 'one', 'times', 'now', 'never', 'get', 'fed', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'apart', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'truly', 'bitchy', 'role', 'Madeline', 'Zima', 'also', 'very', 'annoying', 'role', 'when', 'mother', 'stay', 'put', 'hell', 'just', 'get', 'involved', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognise', 'many', 'actors', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'especially', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'who', 'part', 'asthmatic', 'mother', ""n't"", 'catch', 'fact', 'inhalers', 'stop', 'working', 'same', 'time', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'do', 'brilliantly', 'psychotic', 'nanny', 'mentally', 'ill', 'handyman', 'respectively', 'Rebecca', 'icy', 'cold', 'stare', 'maximum', 'almost', 'evil', 'end', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'have', 'certain', 'childlike', 'quality', 'Ernie', 'only', 'one', 'catch', 'what', 'really', 'trying', 'do', 'do', 'find', 'breastfeeding', 'woman', 'baby', 'little', 'freaky', 'movie', 'sensitivity', 'mental', 'disabilities', ""n't"", 'exploit', 'mental', 'illness', 'simply', 'entertainment.Julianne', 'Moore', 'one', 'first', 'roles', 'looking', 'surprisingly', 'young', 'true', 'saracastic', 'little', 'bitch', 'wish', ""'d"", 'had', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'terrific', 'also', 'cottons', 'fact', 'Peyton', 'psychotic', 'nanny', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right.The', 'whole', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'can', 'imagine', 'people', 'not', 'watching', 'due', 'being', 'big', 'name', 'stars', 'Well', 'A-list', 'celebrities', 'see', 'cheaply', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'so', 'go', 'abuse', 'credit', 'card']",The Hand That Rocks the Cradle VHS
313085,AUFK6UT2DU87H,6302450187,"Meredith L. Burton ""Bookworm""","[2, 2]","I am a huge fan of psychological thrillers.  This film is one that I've just encountered.  The story is riveting from start to finish.  Exploring the universal theme of revenge, this movie depicts the harrowing quest of a family struggling to survive against an insidious yet ruthless evil.Clare is embroilled in a dilemma.  She believes that she has suffered molestation during a routine exam given by her gynocologist.  After Clare reports the doctor to the police, several other women come forward to report simelar allegations.  Dr. Mott cannot withstand the devastation to his practice and commits suicide.  The doctor's mentally unhinged wife systematically plots her revenge against Clare and her family.  Posing as a nanny named Payton Flanders, Mrs. Mott gains ascendancy over the family through her kind facade.  Gradually, Clare begins to suspect that things are not what they seem.I found this story to be very compelling.  My favorite aspect was the psychological mind games instigated by the character of Mrs. Mott.  We see that evil systematically erodes trust of others before it pursues the outright disstruction of its prey.  I love the heroic actions of Clare, and the other individuals in the family are very endearing.The acting in this film is superb.  Rebecca Da Mornay is chilling as the psychotic caregiver.  She brings a malevolence yet oddly empathetic portrayal to a role that could have easily degenerated into campy material.  The woman portraying Clare is excellent, and the little girl who plays the young daughter is great.  I also love the man who portrays Solomon, a mentally challenged yet wise gardener and fix-it man.  This movie is one that should be watched for entertainment and for a stunning portrait of the universal struggle of good and evil.

313103,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,6302450187,Roger J. Buffington,"[0, 0]","In this classic psycho-thriller, an impossibly beautiful Rebecca De Mornay pursues an ingenious plan of revenge.  After her doctor husband commits suicide after being accused of sexually abusing a patient, his gorgeous wife (De Mornay) plots revenge.  Without revealing her true identity, she obtains the job of live-in nanny to the family the mother of which was the primary accuser.  More would be telling.  This is a great thriller.The tension in this film never lets up, and there are tensions of all kinds.  There is sexual tension, because the live-in nanny (De Mornay) is incredibly gorgeous, and you just have to wonder about a wife who would allow another woman this beautiful to live in her home, and hang around her husband that way.  (Quite a thought, actually.)  Plus, the viewer never has any doubt about De Mornay's evil intentions, although there is doubt about whether she is coolly plotting revenge, whether she is truly psycho, or both.  I won't tell.This is a disturbing and tense film that keeps the viewer in suspense throughout.  Rebecca De Mornay is absolutely awesome in this film, and the supporting cast is superb as well.

313105,A1JUYF5D6TFFHB,6302450187,"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya""","[3, 4]","The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, released in 1992, seems to have opened up people's eyes to the real evil in some people who masquerade as babysitters or people of friendly nature you can confide in but who only wish to do harm. Although this is downright drama and sensational, the stuff thrillers are made of, some of its content can in fact occur in real life and there have been many a case that has proven true. It was a thriller in the early 90's, although it may appear rather tame by comparison to our present thriller movies. On DVD, the experience is fresh and the sound quality is incredibly good. The DVD features the original trailer and commentary. It stars Rebecca De Mornay as the scheming and murderous baby-sitter Peyton, Annabella Sciorra as Claire, the hapless wife. The story moves slowly, building up tension to a climatic finale.Peyton's husband, an obstratrician, sexually molests Claire who files a complaint and seeks to get him in jail. The obstratrician commits suicide and triggers a miscarriage in Peyton, who was about to have his child. So, there it is. The set-up. Peyton really does have valid reasons to be angry. She has lost everything -her husband, her baby and her home. But she is so consumed with bitterness and by her desire for revenge that she is stripped of her humanity and becomes an authentic villain so perfect for this type of film. Rebecca De Mornay's non-threatening, beautiful and innocent Caucasian features are a perfect disguise. She takes a job as babysitter to Claire's daughter Emma. Now safe in the family's trust, she conducts scheme after scheme to destroy Claire and to exact revenge. She is breastfeeding Claire's infant to mark the child as hers(Peyton proves that women can be just as territorial as men and just as ruthless, perhaps more so) she wins Emma's trust and affection by forging a false friendship, she frames the black help, who is a bit weak and slow but proves heroic in the finale, by making Claire believe he is sexually molesting Emma -she hides Emma's panties in a drawer in the storage room. She even tries to break up Claire and her husband by making Claire believe that he is having an affair with his old friend and sweetheart (played by Julian Moore who ends up killed in the greenhouse by Peyton) and Peyton even attempts to seduce Claire's husband for herself! There is no stopping her until her come-uppance comes just in time for the ending.The dangerous ""outsider"" coming into the safety of a perfectly happy family really works as a thriller in cinema. We cannot sympathize with Peyton, because she is a very corrupt and vicious woman. Although we would like to see Claire, Sciorra's character, be more defensive and try to protect her family and even eliminate the villain herself, we cannot help but worry how it will turn out for her since she is not a very strong woman and is in fact a victim of asthma. The real star of the show is Rebecca De Mornay anyways and so it was fitting that Claire is a weak contrast by comparison to Rebecca's powerfully evil performance. The location was shot in Southern California somewhere near the Hollywood Hills or perhaps a suburban community, is tailor-made for the ambiance of a dark film such as this one. Who'd ever guess that such intense crime could happen in a small town that looks blameless ? The music is effectively chilling, although the composer or music editor seems to have delighted in playing with the theme of innocence mingled with evil- the soprano aria ""Poor Wondering One"" from the Gilbert and Sullivan opera ""The Pirates Of Penzance"" is played repeatedly as it seems to be an album that Claire has in her house. At one point, the orchestral score twists the cheerful melody by using darker and menacing instrumental themesso that ""Poor Wondering One"" sounds more serious and visceral.The rest of the music is appropriately detached, shocking and like most other thiller movie scores.",5,Revenge Of The Babysitter: The Classic Thriller,1079395200,"03 16, 2004",2004,3942,"['Hand', 'Cradle', 'released', '1992', 'have', 'opened', 'up', 'people', 'eyes', 'real', 'evil', 'people', 'who', 'masquerade', 'babysitters', 'people', 'friendly', 'nature', 'can', 'confide', 'who', 'only', 'wish', 'do', 'harm', 'downright', 'drama', 'sensational', 'stuff', 'thrillers', 'are', 'made', 'content', 'can', 'fact', 'occur', 'real', 'life', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'case', 'proven', 'true', 'was', 'thriller', 'early', '90', 'may', 'appear', 'rather', 'tame', 'comparison', 'present', 'thriller', 'movies', 'DVD', 'experience', 'fresh', 'sound', 'quality', 'incredibly', 'good', 'DVD', 'original', 'trailer', 'commentary', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'scheming', 'murderous', 'baby-sitter', 'Peyton', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'Claire', 'hapless', 'wife', 'story', 'slowly', 'building', 'up', 'tension', 'climatic', 'finale.Peyton', 'husband', 'obstratrician', 'sexually', 'molests', 'Claire', 'who', 'complaint', 'get', 'jail', 'obstratrician', 'commits', 'suicide', 'miscarriage', 'Peyton', 'who', 'was', 'about', 'have', 'child', 'So', 'set-up', 'Peyton', 'really', 'have', 'valid', 'reasons', 'be', 'angry', 'lost', 'everything', '-her', 'husband', 'baby', 'home', 'so', 'consumed', 'bitterness', 'desire', 'revenge', 'stripped', 'humanity', 'authentic', 'villain', 'so', 'perfect', 'type', 'film', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'non-threatening', 'beautiful', 'innocent', 'Caucasian', 'features', 'are', 'perfect', 'disguise', 'job', 'babysitter', 'Claire', 'daughter', 'Emma', 'Now', 'safe', 'family', 'trust', 'scheme', 'scheme', 'destroy', 'Claire', 'exact', 'revenge', 'breastfeeding', 'Claire', 'infant', 'mark', 'child', 'hers', 'Peyton', 'women', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'territorial', 'men', 'just', 'ruthless', 'perhaps', 'more', 'so', 'Emma', 'trust', 'affection', 'forging', 'false', 'friendship', 'black', 'help', 'who', 'bit', 'weak', 'slow', 'heroic', 'finale', 'making', 'Claire', 'believe', 'sexually', 'molesting', 'Emma', '-she', 'Emma', 'panties', 'drawer', 'storage', 'room', 'even', 'break', 'up', 'Claire', 'husband', 'making', 'Claire', 'believe', 'having', 'affair', 'old', 'friend', 'sweetheart', 'played', 'Julian', 'Moore', 'who', 'up', 'killed', 'greenhouse', 'Peyton', 'Peyton', 'even', 'seduce', 'Claire', 'husband', 'herself', 'stopping', 'come-uppance', 'just', 'time', 'ending.The', 'dangerous', 'outsider', 'coming', 'safety', 'perfectly', 'happy', 'family', 'really', 'thriller', 'cinema', 'can', 'not', 'sympathize', 'Peyton', 'very', 'corrupt', 'vicious', 'woman', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'Claire', 'Sciorra', 'character', 'be', 'more', 'defensive', 'try', 'protect', 'family', 'even', 'eliminate', 'villain', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'worry', 'how', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'not', 'very', 'strong', 'woman', 'fact', 'victim', 'asthma', 'real', 'star', 'show', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'anyways', 'so', 'was', 'fitting', 'Claire', 'weak', 'contrast', 'comparison', 'Rebecca', 'powerfully', 'evil', 'performance', 'location', 'was', 'shot', 'Southern', 'California', 'somewhere', 'Hollywood', 'Hills', 'perhaps', 'suburban', 'community', 'tailor-made', 'ambiance', 'dark', 'film', 'such', 'one', 'Who', ""'d"", 'ever', 'guess', 'such', 'intense', 'crime', 'could', 'happen', 'small', 'town', 'blameless', 'music', 'effectively', 'chilling', 'composer', 'music', 'editor', 'have', 'delighted', 'playing', 'theme', 'innocence', 'mingled', 'evil-', 'soprano', 'Poor', 'Wondering', 'One', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'opera', 'Pirates', 'Penzance', 'played', 'repeatedly', 'be', 'album', 'Claire', 'house', 'one', 'point', 'orchestral', 'score', 'cheerful', 'melody', 'using', 'darker', 'menacing', 'instrumental', 'themesso', 'Poor', 'Wondering', 'One', 'more', 'serious', 'visceral.The', 'rest', 'music', 'appropriately', 'detached', 'shocking', 'most', 'other', 'thiller', 'movie', 'scores']",The Hand That Rocks the Cradle VHS

Well-integrated, unique situations you don't see every day in this genre, plus genuinely scary surprises keep it from slipping into stock mode or mean spiritedness...Veteran soundtrack composer Graeme Revell's musical score compliments the mood and action extremely well but visual DVD transfer appears less than perfect; too bad, because it's an otherwise good-looking film with rich colors and appealing locations.

313114,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,6302450187,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[1, 1]","""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" first hit theatres in January, 1992 and was immediately a boxoffice hit, staying at #1 for over two weeks. It was one of those Hollywood films that made people talk about how important it was for people to do a thorough investigation of nanny's when it came time to hire those to care for one's child.The movie is about a young couple living in Seattle who hire a woman to be the caregiver for their little girl Emma and their new-born son Joe. Rebecca DeMornay, best known for playing a prostitute in the Tom Cruise flick ""Risky Business"", became a movie star in ""The Hand That Rocks That Cradle"". DeMornay plays a crazed woman seeking revenge on the mother who she works for, as she blames her for the death of her husband who committed suicide. Peyton, the DeMornay character, is one of the most vicious villins in movie history, as she makes life a living hell for the family that entrusts her with their lives and their home.This is s first-rate thriller and the ending is one of the best. The DVD is pretty much barebones, but it does come with the trailer. Look for Ernie Hudson who plays a small role in the movie as a mentally challenged handy man. Hudson would gain fame as the prison warden in HBO's ""Oz"" in 1997.",5,"""A Film That Never Ages""",1241395200,"05 4, 2009",2009,1257,"['Hand', 'Cradle', 'first', 'hit', 'theatres', 'January', '1992', 'was', 'immediately', 'boxoffice', 'hit', 'staying', '1', 'two', 'weeks', 'was', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'made', 'people', 'talk', 'how', 'important', 'was', 'people', 'do', 'thorough', 'investigation', 'nanny', 'when', 'came', 'time', 'hire', 'care', 'one', 'child.The', 'movie', 'young', 'couple', 'living', 'Seattle', 'who', 'hire', 'woman', 'be', 'caregiver', 'little', 'girl', 'Emma', 'new-born', 'son', 'Joe', 'Rebecca', 'DeMornay', 'best', 'known', 'playing', 'prostitute', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'flick', 'Risky', 'Business', 'became', 'movie', 'star', 'Hand', 'Cradle', 'DeMornay', 'crazed', 'woman', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'mother', 'who', 'death', 'husband', 'who', 'committed', 'suicide', 'Peyton', 'DeMornay', 'character', 'one', 'most', 'vicious', 'villins', 'movie', 'history', 'life', 'living', 'hell', 'family', 'lives', 'home.This', 's', 'first-rate', 'thriller', 'ending', 'one', 'best', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'much', 'barebones', 'come', 'trailer', 'Look', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'who', 'small', 'role', 'movie', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'handy', 'man', 'Hudson', 'would', 'gain', 'fame', 'prison', 'warden', 'HBO', 'Oz', '1997']",The Hand That Rocks the Cradle VHS

It is one of my all time favs.  Rebecca Demornay is brilliant in this film.  She plays a totally convincing psychpath, you love to hate her!  I think she is one of  the most underated actresses around.  Why hasn't she done more movies?!?  Annabella Sciora  plays a dimwitted housewife oblivious to everything going  on around her, it becomes rather sad watching her, almost making it a bit  comical at times.
