231874,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300268063,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I&#8217;ve been pretty vocal for years about not being &#8216;fond of Fonda&#8217;, and that has included all variations of the name (Jane, Henry, Peter, Bridget).  So, when seeing their films I continue to cement this truth in my mind and continue to be confused as to why they are all so beloved.  Jane Fonda has impressed me a few times, but overall I just find the whole clan so stale.So, I&#8217;ll admit that that is exactly why I was hesitant to even bother watching &#8216;Klute&#8217;, but I knew that I really needed to.  I didn&#8217;t agree with Fonda&#8217;s second Oscar win, despite loving &#8216;Coming Home&#8217;, but there was a lot of love surrounding this particular performance, and so I decided to dive in.  My issue with Fonda has always been that she was so&#8230;dull, but playing a call girl on the run from a killer gave me some hope that she could liven up under the material.This has got to be one of the weirdest Best Actress Oscar wins in the history of Oscar, and that doesn&#8217;t mean that the performance is bad (it&#8217;s actually REALLY good) but the whole film/character just doesn&#8217;t feel like an Oscar winner.  I know that Oscar has rewarded hookers with a heart of gold many times, but have they ever embraced a B-grade thriller like this one before?No, &#8216;Klute&#8217; isn&#8217;t a bad film at all, but let&#8217;s be honest here.The film centers on a call girl named Bree who is being questioned by Klute, a private investigator trying to track down a missing man who may or may not be a serial killer targeting call girls.  Bree is hesitant to help, but her emotional makeup and desperate attempt to uncover her own internal issues and make steps towards recovery cause her to be drawn to Klute, for personal gain (in more ways than one).  As they both weave towards the truth, their lives are intersected by Bree&#8217;s world and the danger surrounding Klute&#8217;s world.As a whole, this works a lot, largely because of Fonda&#8217;s committed performance (so layered) and the brilliant cinematography.  I kind of love that this was Oscar nominated for its screenplay, since it is so littered with horrendous dialog and that cop out ending that just, well, plummets.  Still, that score (which is bipolar and jumps from eerie marvelousness to soap opera camp) sets such a tone, and the chemistry between all the performers is stunning.  Fonda gets so much right here.  She portrays the sex appeal effortlessly, yet she knows how to sell the internal struggle (her character&#8217;s own perception of her emotional makeup is outstanding to witness) and her final scene with the killer is all reaction and all perfection.  Sutherland walks through this as a cypher, but he commands our attention, and the two key supporting turns by Roy Scheider (better here than in his Oscar nominated role from that year, &#8216;The French Connection&#8217;) and Charles Cioffi are magnificent.Like I said, this is sort of B-grade and yet that&#8217;s a B+ since it really does work from start to finish despite all the nitpicking one can do!",4,My fondness has just grown&#8230;,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,3086,"['8217', 'been', 'pretty', 'vocal', 'years', 'not', 'being', '8216', 'fond', 'Fonda', '8217', 'included', 'variations', 'name', 'Jane', 'Henry', 'Peter', 'Bridget', 'So', 'when', 'seeing', 'films', 'continue', 'cement', 'truth', 'mind', 'continue', 'be', 'confused', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'beloved', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'impressed', 'few', 'times', 'overall', 'just', 'find', 'whole', 'clan', 'so', 'stale.So', '8217', 'admit', 'exactly', 'why', 'was', 'hesitant', 'even', 'bother', 'watching', '8216', 'Klute', '8217', 'knew', 'really', 'needed', 'didn', '8217', 'agree', 'Fonda', '8217', 's', 'second', 'Oscar', 'win', 'loving', '8216', 'Coming', 'Home', '8217', 'there', 'was', 'lot', 'love', 'surrounding', 'particular', 'performance', 'so', 'decided', 'dive', 'issue', 'Fonda', 'always', 'been', 'was', 'so', '8230', 'dull', 'playing', 'call', 'girl', 'run', 'killer', 'gave', 'hope', 'could', 'liven', 'up', 'material.This', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'weirdest', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'history', 'Oscar', 'doesn', '8217', 'mean', 'performance', 'bad', '8217', 'actually', 'REALLY', 'good', 'whole', 'film/character', 'just', 'doesn', '8217', 'feel', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'know', 'Oscar', 'rewarded', 'hookers', 'heart', 'gold', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'ever', 'embraced', 'B-grade', 'thriller', 'one', 'No', '8216', 'Klute', '8217', '8217', 'bad', 'film', 'let', '8217', 'be', 'honest', 'here.The', 'film', 'centers', 'call', 'girl', 'named', 'Bree', 'who', 'being', 'questioned', 'Klute', 'private', 'investigator', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'missing', 'man', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'serial', 'killer', 'targeting', 'call', 'girls', 'Bree', 'hesitant', 'help', 'emotional', 'makeup', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'uncover', 'own', 'internal', 'issues', 'make', 'steps', 'towards', 'recovery', 'cause', 'be', 'drawn', 'Klute', 'personal', 'gain', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'weave', 'towards', 'truth', 'lives', 'are', 'intersected', 'Bree', '8217', 's', 'world', 'danger', 'surrounding', 'Klute', '8217', 'world.As', 'whole', 'lot', 'largely', 'Fonda', '8217', 'committed', 'performance', 'so', 'layered', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'kind', 'love', 'was', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'screenplay', 'so', 'littered', 'horrendous', 'dialog', 'out', 'ending', 'just', 'well', 'plummets', 'Still', 'score', 'bipolar', 'jumps', 'eerie', 'marvelousness', 'soap', 'opera', 'camp', 'sets', 'such', 'tone', 'chemistry', 'performers', 'stunning', 'Fonda', 'so', 'much', 'right', 'here', 'sex', 'appeal', 'effortlessly', 'yet', 'how', 'sell', 'internal', 'struggle', 'character', '8217', 'own', 'perception', 'emotional', 'makeup', 'outstanding', 'witness', 'final', 'scene', 'killer', 'reaction', 'perfection', 'Sutherland', 'through', 'cypher', 'attention', 'two', 'key', 'supporting', 'turns', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'better', 'here', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'role', 'year', '8216', 'French', 'Connection', '8217', 'Charles', 'Cioffi', 'are', 'magnificent.Like', 'said', 'sort', 'B-grade', 'yet', '8217', 's', 'B+', 'really', 'work', 'start', 'finish', 'nitpicking', 'one', 'can', 'do']",N/A

This is one of the Fonda films I tell them to watch upon hearing this, followed closely by ""Coming Home"" and ""Julia.""  Frankly, upon seeing these films, I thought she had more talent than Dad Henry or brother Peter or niece Bridget (the dna for acting ability must be very strong in this family).  Fonda plays Bree Daniels, a prostitute in 1970s New York City, and you see every gritty detail of her handling her profession.  Making her life more dangerous is that she is threatened by a stalker/serial murderer (this villain role was not overdone at the time this film was made in the early '70s).  This film does not glamourize prostitution which so many later films have attempted to do.  One thing you will notice right away is how distinctive her voice is in this film and I've come to notice that most of the great actresses have these fabulous screen voices.  The late Alan J. Pakula directed the film.  He was an extremely talented writer-director-producer whose work I've missed since his passing.  Donald Sutherland is a detective who comes into the stalking case and he does a very solid job throughout including kindling some romantic interest with the Fonda character (they did have a real life affair during the making of the film so the chemistry between them really works).

231884,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,6300268063,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[5, 5]","""Klute"" is a sleek neo-noir thriller, a moving, troubling love story, and a showcase for one of cinema's most gripping performances, that of Jane Fonda as prostitute Bree Daniel. Donald Sutherland as Klute, a small-town cop on a mission of the heart in the big city, is the perfect foil to Fonda / Bree. The film is also a time capsule of hippie attitudes, styles, pleasures and paranoias. It is at times quite scary, creating an atmosphere of twisted menace. Like noirs of old, it offers glimpses into the lives of the rich and the fallen, and crackerjack dialogue.Fonda's multiple award-winning performance in ""Klute"" is, alone, reason enough to see the movie. You can't take your eyes off her. She is, second-by-second, fascinating. Look away for one eyeblink, and you miss something, something spectacular. I don't know if there has ever been prostitute anything like Bree Daniel, but I know plenty of less colorfully-employed women very much like her. Fonda plays Bree as a sort of live-action, post-Friedan, feminist essay. Fonda / Bree is, by turns, convincingly terrified, vulnerable, invulnerable, vicious, tender, powerful, weak and victimized, manipulative, bruised, flush, hungry and sated. Fonda externalizes the combination of attraction and revulsion that heterosexual women have been feeling for men ever since Eve. She also creates a convincing character you can fully believe hick Klute would fall for - and would eventually break his heart. She's the bright, shiny object and he is the hypnotized puppy. Watching him fall for her, you rejoice for her - a good man will rescue her! But you worry for him. Bree can be quite the merciless headcase.Bree's profession as prostitute is not the film's only avenue to commenting on what it means to be a woman; Bree is also an actress. Before we see her service a client, we see her on a call for an advertisement for cosmetics. We see that society condones the objectification of women as models and actresses and manikins in cosmetic ads. We see how utterly brutal and dehumanizing that demand for female flesh is. The ruthless objectification of actresses and models makes the regard a john shows Bree when she goes on a ""date"" seem benign by comparison. In commenting on women by commenting on acting, ""Klute"" would make a great second show in a double feature with ""All About Eve.""Fonda isn't just something to watch, she is something to hear. One of the recurrent themes of the film is surreptitious listening to recordings of voices and surreptitious study of others' written words. Several characters do it, some with benign motivations, some with quiet evil and twisted ones. I've never been as aware of Fonda's spoke voice as in this film, and her voice is jewel-like in its precision and allure. This isn't just a great movie to watch, it's a great one to *hear.*Michael Small's score is perfection. ""Klute"" is a small, sometimes claustrophobic, urban film, and Small's score never overwhelms; it is, in its quiet way, indispensible to the film's sense of perversion and menace, and then, subtly and believably, when the film becomes a love story, the score eases and enhances that transition. Just listening to the jazzy, low-key, intimate trumpet, you know you are hearing the soundtrack of two troubled people who are falling in love and whose love faces a rocky road. During one scene Bree services an elderly, Ashkenazi client, and the score comes right along, sounding like the cimbalom an inn in Mitteleuropa.Donald Sutherland, as Klute, plays the ""fixed foot that makes no show to move"" to Bree's glitter and drama. Both Sutherland the actor and Klute the character are willing to stand back and let Fonda absorb the audience's attention. That's quite remarkable; how often in recent films has a male actor / character allowed a woman so much spotlight? Klute's quietude and stoicism are no accident, though. He is playing a strong, good, old fashioned man, one more about actions than words. He is a hero in the Gary Cooper mold.That old fashioned heroism is a great surprise in this movie. ""Klute"" wallows in, and celebrates, post-censorship, post-Woodstock freedoms and indulgences. We see naked body parts, prostitutes and madams and heroin addicts and perverts, and, in a cameo, Candy Darling, Andy Warhol's star. We couldn't see this world with such detail back in the old days - but the film's heart *is* back in the old days. The good guy, Klute, the hero who rides into the wild west - hooker and drug addict run Manhattan - is a very straight, white, male cop. In this hippie, let it all hang out world, where the rich white man is utterly corrupt, the small town, working class guy is the hero.""Klute"" is rife with small performances by character actors, and small moments, that make every minute worthwhile. Charles Cioffi is frighteningly convincing. Vivian Nathan, as Bree's shrink, comes across as a real shrink. A narcissistic casting director who childishly and maliciously toys with Bree sets your teeth on edge. A black cop is solid. Roy Scheider is the pimp you love to hate.There are priceless small touches that show intelligence and care with which director Pakula made the film. Betty Murray, as a loving wife, looks at her husband across a dinner table with such a look of love that that husband's disappearance becomes a real tragedy. Bree's apartment includes a sketch of John F. Kennedy; that sketch tells us something essential about Bree that nothing else in the film does. A group of powerful men discusses a missing person's case; Klute is the rube at the table. We know because, in a brief shot, we see that though he's wearing a suit, he's also wearing white sweat socks, visible as his slacks ride high up on his calves.",5,Brilliant Neo Noir; Moving Love

It seems to get better with every viewing.  When Pennsylvania business executive and family man Tom Grunemann goes missing, friend and detective John Klute (Donald Sutherland) agrees to take on the case.  His only clue is prostitute Bree Daniels (Jane Fonda) in New York who was associated with a prostitute Grunemann had known and who is at the brunt of harassment calls possibly from Grunemann.  As Klute watches Bree, the killer is watching.  Although Bree is struggling to leave ""the life"" (aspiring to act), she is simultaneously drawn to the money, autonomy and emotional control it provides.  Klute is brought deeper into Bree's world of prostitution, paranoia and drugs and unexpectedly he penetrates her emotional walls.""Klute"" is definitely Jane Fonda's showcase and she is fantastic, netting the Oscar that year against the odds.  This may have been her ""breakout"" role at a time when she was notoriously unpopular because of her involvement in Hanoi, but she has turned in numerous fine performances over the years in films ranging from ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" to ""On Golden Pond.""  As Bree Daniels, she has a complex character who, as she attests, had some college, and who is vulnerable yet acerbic, impenetrable yet exposed.  Whether speaking with her therapist, walking jauntily down the street or turning a trick, Bree as embodied by Fonda is fascinating to watch.Some mention that the ""thriller part"" is weak because you know the identity of the killer.  I would disagree.  Knowing the identity of the killer is part of the suspense.  In this claustrophobic world of shadowy stalkers and anonymity, it's like knowing the bomb is under the table, as Hitchcock once said.  The claustrophobia and isolation also are deeply reflective of both New York and the character of Bree Daniels, revealing the irony of her ""freedom.""  Surveillance tapes also figure largely in this film and were a big thing in the 70's.  They would also figure largely in Watergate.Aside from Fonda and Sutherland, the supporting players (including Roy Scheider and Jean Stapleton) perfectly embody their roles and add to the authenticity, and there is also a great tingly soundtrack by Michael Small.  It's one of the finest films to come out of the 70's.  I also get a kick out of seeing Fonda reading ""Linda Goodman's Sun Signs"" which was a rage in the 70's.

231887,A1LF84ED2L4MXB,6300268063,Doreen Appleton,"[2, 2]","My copy of Klute died of terminal tiling, so I ordered a new one from Amazon for only $7.50.Someone did a new transfer without telling anyone. The quality of the picture is much better, though on my Hitachi plasma TV black enhancement is necessary, because red distortion plagues certain darker areas of the picture.If you like this movie, you'd better jump on the $5.99, because Amazon plays with the price and next week it could be $16.99.Klute is one of the greatest thrillers ever made, unique in its elegant, aristocratic style, also unique in the seamy sexual world these elegant images lead us into. Bree Daniels is a hard-as-nails call girl afraid for her life. Someone is following her, calling her at night. Donald Sutherland is a police officer untrained in missing persons work, who is looking for Tom Gruneman, a business executive who disappeared about a year ago. The police speculate that Gruneman is the person stalking Fonda.It turns out that Peter Cable, a high executive in Klute's company, is the stalker. On a first viewing one doesn't quite see this, because the shots of the man in the corporate conference room listening to tapes of Fonda talking is not not clearly identified as Peter Cable. This adds to the mystery.The verticals and backlit shots in Klute are justly famous. Less well known is the theme of the pulley: the pulley that operates the killer's pocket recorder, the larger pulley of Klute's tape recorder in the ground floor apartment of Bree's building, the bobbins in the garment center, the pulleys that operate the elevators which are constantly seen throughout the movie. Indeed, the final scene consists in Cable forcing Bree to listen to the tape of his murder of Arlan Paige, one of the three witnesses (he has killed all three) to his violent sexual behavior.I am sure that Pakula, one of the most astute filmmakers who ever lived, was also thinking of the movie camera, which is a pulley system, and the projection of the movie in a theater, which is done by a pulley. Indeed, there are two projectors shown in the movie: the projector at Momma Reese's whorehouse, and the crucial projector on which the killer's typing idiosyncrasies are matched up to the typing of Peter Cable.Speaking of elevators, according to Sigmund Freud the ""downstairs"" is a symbol of the cloaca, the nether regions of the body and the human psyche, while the ""upstairs"" symbolizes the breasts of the woman. I doubt that the screenwriters or the production designer had this specifically in mind, but it seems inescapable when one considers the constant up-and-down movement of the elevators and the extreme sexual content of the story. We see many seamy lower regions, including the basement where Klute has Cable trapped without knowing it, and calls out ""Tom?"", thinking the intruder is Gruneman. There is also a phrase that cannot be repeated here that Bree says to her psychiatrist about looking into a metaphorical part of the anatomy of the world she thought she knew.There is a magnificent, almost wordless scene toward the end of the movie, which leads to a brutal transition. Klute and Bree are shopping at an outdoor fruit market at night. Bree notices a man carrying his little son on his shoulders. The man smiles at Bree. Her face softens momentarily as she wonders what it would be like to live a straight life, to have a family and children. Then a skeptical look of resignation replaces the soft look, for she realizes she can never have this life. Nevertheless, she pulls affectionately at the back of Klute's jacket as they leave the market.When they arrive at her apartment, the door is open, the apartment has been trashed, the bed cut to pieces by an intruder. The phone rings. Bree answers. Her own recorded voice, from a session with one of her clients, greets her. ""I can be a very bad girl, you know. I sometimes have very wicked ideas."" Bree screams and hands the phone to Klute.(This scene is important, because the semen found on her panties is traced to Peter Cable.)Jane Fonda gives one of her best performances as the hard-nosed prostitute who is secretly vulnerable and afraid.

His polish never falters until the final scene, when he expresses his fear and contempt for women.A small flaw in the story is that neither Bree nor Klute realize the obvious fact that the killer is right across the street, and thus can telephone Bree when he sees her turn out her light.A classic thriller, not to be missed.",5,New transfer,1286496000,"10 8, 2010",2010,4606,"['copy', 'Klute', 'died', 'terminal', 'tiling', 'ordered', 'new', 'one', 'Amazon', 'only', '7.50.Someone', 'did', 'new', 'transfer', 'telling', 'anyone', 'quality', 'picture', 'much', 'better', 'Hitachi', 'plasma', 'TV', 'black', 'enhancement', 'necessary', 'red', 'distortion', 'plagues', 'certain', 'darker', 'areas', 'picture.If', 'movie', ""'d"", 'better', 'jump', '5.99', 'Amazon', 'price', 'next', 'week', 'could', 'be', '16.99.Klute', 'one', 'greatest', 'thrillers', 'ever', 'made', 'unique', 'elegant', 'aristocratic', 'style', 'also', 'unique', 'seamy', 'sexual', 'world', 'elegant', 'images', 'lead', 'Bree', 'Daniels', 'hard-as-nails', 'call', 'girl', 'afraid', 'life', 'Someone', 'following', 'calling', 'night', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'police', 'officer', 'untrained', 'missing', 'persons', 'work', 'who', 'looking', 'Tom', 'Gruneman', 'business', 'executive', 'who', 'disappeared', 'year', 'ago', 'police', 'speculate', 'Gruneman', 'person', 'stalking', 'Fonda.It', 'out', 'Peter', 'Cable', 'high', 'executive', 'Klute', 'company', 'stalker', 'first', 'viewing', 'one', ""n't"", 'quite', 'see', 'shots', 'man', 'corporate', 'conference', 'room', 'listening', 'tapes', 'Fonda', 'talking', 'not', 'not', 'clearly', 'identified', 'Peter', 'Cable', 'mystery.The', 'verticals', 'backlit', 'shots', 'Klute', 'are', 'justly', 'famous', 'Less', 'well', 'known', 'theme', 'pulley', 'pulley', 'killer', 'pocket', 'recorder', 'larger', 'pulley', 'Klute', 'tape', 'recorder', 'ground', 'floor', 'apartment', 'Bree', 'building', 'bobbins', 'garment', 'center', 'pulleys', 'operate', 'elevators', 'are', 'constantly', 'seen', 'movie', 'Indeed', 'final', 'scene', 'Cable', 'forcing', 'Bree', 'listen', 'tape', 'murder', 'Arlan', 'Paige', 'one', 'three', 'witnesses', 'killed', 'three', 'violent', 'sexual', 'behavior.I', 'am', 'sure', 'Pakula', 'one', 'most', 'astute', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', 'was', 'also', 'thinking', 'movie', 'camera', 'pulley', 'system', 'projection', 'movie', 'theater', 'done', 'pulley', 'Indeed', 'are', 'two', 'projectors', 'shown', 'movie', 'projector', 'Momma', 'Reese', 'whorehouse', 'crucial', 'projector', 'killer', 'typing', 'idiosyncrasies', 'are', 'matched', 'typing', 'Peter', 'Cable.Speaking', 'elevators', 'according', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'downstairs', 'symbol', 'cloaca', 'nether', 'regions', 'body', 'human', 'psyche', 'upstairs', 'breasts', 'woman', 'doubt', 'screenwriters', 'production', 'designer', 'had', 'specifically', 'mind', 'inescapable', 'when', 'one', 'constant', 'up-and-down', 'movement', 'elevators', 'extreme', 'sexual', 'content', 'story', 'see', 'many', 'seamy', 'lower', 'regions', 'including', 'basement', 'where', 'Klute', 'Cable', 'trapped', 'knowing', 'out', 'Tom', 'thinking', 'intruder', 'Gruneman', 'also', 'phrase', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'repeated', 'here', 'Bree', 'psychiatrist', 'looking', 'metaphorical', 'part', 'anatomy', 'world', 'thought', 'magnificent', 'almost', 'wordless', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'brutal', 'transition', 'Klute', 'Bree', 'are', 'shopping', 'outdoor', 'fruit', 'market', 'night', 'Bree', 'man', 'carrying', 'little', 'son', 'shoulders', 'man', 'Bree', 'face', 'momentarily', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'live', 'straight', 'life', 'have', 'family', 'children', 'Then', 'skeptical', 'look', 'resignation', 'soft', 'look', 'can', 'never', 'have', 'life', 'Nevertheless', 'affectionately', 'back', 'Klute', 'jacket', 'leave', 'market.When', 'arrive', 'apartment', 'door', 'open', 'apartment', 'been', 'trashed', 'bed', 'cut', 'pieces', 'intruder', 'phone', 'rings', 'Bree', 'answers', 'own', 'recorded', 'voice', 'session', 'one', 'clients', 'greets', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'bad', 'girl', 'know', 'sometimes', 'have', 'very', 'wicked', 'ideas', 'Bree', 'screams', 'phone', 'Klute', 'scene', 'important', 'semen', 'found', 'panties', 'traced', 'Peter', 'Cable', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'hard-nosed', 'prostitute', 'who', 'secretly', 'vulnerable', 'afraid', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'magnificent', 'poker-faced', 'detective', 'who', 'eventually', 'icy', 'exterior', 'Charles', 'Cioffi', 'killer', 'wonderful', 'polish', 'never', 'falters', 'final', 'scene', 'when', 'fear', 'contempt', 'women.A', 'small', 'flaw', 'story', 'Bree', 'Klute', 'realize', 'obvious', 'fact', 'killer', 'right', 'street', 'thus', 'can', 'telephone', 'Bree', 'when', 'turn', 'out', 'light.A', 'classic', 'thriller', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

Pakula (whose &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; was so boring that it almost rendered me comatose), my wife had to twist my arm to get me to sit down to this movie. I'm glad she did. While it has little to offer as a thriller (for one thing, they make it pretty clear who the bad guy is early on), it's a knock-out character study. I always assumed that Fonda got the Oscar for this because of the Academy's well-documented predilection for rewarding actresses who play prostitutes (you have a better explanation for Mira Sorvino?) but she really gives an unforgettably tough and believable performance here. (Believable as a human being, I should say. There can't have been a sex-worker so meticulous about her &quot;craft&quot; in the entire history of the world's oldest profession.) And, quite predictably, Donald Sutherland is awesome - creating a compelling performance practically out of thin air. (His character is very underwritten and doesn't have much dialogue.)

Pakula's attempt to reinvent the traditional urban detective film; it may be seen as even better today than when it was released in 1971. Dispensing with giving clear conventional backstories for most of his characters, Pakula has them reveal themselves primarily through their dialogue: both the displanted Pennsylvanian detective, John Klute, and his quarry, a sadistic killer, use audiotape as tools of their trade. Their secret recordings of the heroine Bree, a high class call girl memorably played by Jane Fonda, evokes the talk of the therapy sessions she attends throughout the entire film, where she tries to make sense of her downwards career and conflicted feelings about her trade. Klute himself says hardly anything in the film, in a manner very much akin to a therapist's silences; we find out little about his motivations in a way that can seem frustrating but that was also clearly intentional. The film is mostly used to explore the rich character of Fonda's character, Bree Daniels, and there are probably few films that allowed such a fine actor so much breathing room to show her stuff.

What acting by everyone involved, a very young and dashing Donald Sutherland, a very very hot Jane Fonda, and a minor role by Roy Scheider as Fonda's seedy pimp.Sutherland plays the title role as a detective prowling the underbelly of New York to clear his friend's name and to track down the perverse psycho responsible for the death of 2 prostitutes. His number 1 lead is Bree, a seasoned prostitute who, purportedly, had a relationship with the deceased parties. Power and control are everything to Bree,desensitized by her numerous encounters and as cold as ice, that is until Klute walks into her life.This is an absolutely terrific film, similar in feel to another great film of that period, The French Connection, in that it plays a lot like a documentary augmented by the intimate voice-over sessions she has with her psychiatrist and voice-overs throughout the film. In fact, the film is less about the crime it follows than about Bree herself, of the power of human feeling, concern, and love to thaw even the iciest heart, to make the most heartless being soft and vulnerable.This is a very potent, yet very low-key film, without a lot of drama, a lot of violence, except that which is implied through the account of the crime by various characters.

Menta, Jr.","[5, 5]","As high as so many 1970's films rank on the all-time best American movies list, many of them- their ultimate quality aside- resisted delivering a story that was too linear or too easily comprehensible, perhaps in fear of being labeled mere entertainment or too commercial... ""Three Women"" or ""Night Moves"" anyone?  The nice thing about ""Klute"" is that, although some elements remain ambiguous (not every little detail is explained), in the end you know who was behind everything and the basic mechanics of the plot.  Call me old-fashioned but I like that in a movie.For those who like moody, character-driven detective stories, you really can't go wrong with ""Klute"", and Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland are excellent.  It also doesn't hurt that the film was beautifully photographed, in all his dark and shadowy glory, by Gordon Willis, who went on to fame the following year when he photographed ""The Godfather.""The DVD offers a clean, sharp widescreen print of the film, which doesn't betray the movie's age at all.  Also included on the DVD is an eight or nine minute promotional film, about the shooting of ""Klute"" in New York City, that was produced at the same time as the feature film.  This short promo film made me smile: its tone was essentially that everyone at the time had thrown in the towel regarding New York's crime, corruption, and filthy streets, and that although the movie's producers were glad to shoot there for authenticity, they were equally glad to get out.

Perez ""Jose""","[4, 5]","It's easy to see why Jane Fonda won her first Oscar for her turn as a brilliant actress-hooker in this top-notch Alan J Pakula thriller/character study.  I recently caught &quot;Klute&quot; again on cable and was immediately taken in as if I'd never the film in the first place, which for me is a sign of a movie's overall impact.  Bree, Fonda's character, has tricked with more than a few unusual characters and when one of them stays missing for 6 months, a private detective - the Klute character - is called in to investigate by the poor fellow's family.  Whan ensues is a heart-pounding maze of a movie, with twists and turns today's audiences might be expecting, but that are nonetheless delivered in faux-Hitchcockian splendor by the talented Pakula.  Donald Sutherland - that most deserving of underrated actors - is perhaps his best ever (other than in &quot;Ordinary People&quot;) as Klute.  His son, Keiffer, stars on TV's hit series &quot;24&quot; and its clear where he gets the acting gene.  The startlingly young and dashing Donald looks less like Keiffer and much more like the brilliant Tobey McGuire (in his pre=Spiderman spate of pics like &quot;Cider House Rules.&quot;)  He's everyman and no one at once, which and of itself requires tremendous acting chops. Sutherland's got them in spades.  Also watch for a pre-&quot;All in the Family&quot; Jean Stapleton as a kooky secretary late in the movie.  Some of the 60s and early 70s lingo, mood rings and situations might fall flat for today's viewers (i.e. letting it all hang out, etc.)but overall, this is a terrific picture.

At moments, you see the hunger he has in his eyes for Bree; at others, compassion.  The scene where he returns tape recordings, she tries to demean him by seeing if he'd been seduced by the big city.

231909,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,6300268063,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[3, 4]","This great classic is an interesting watch, but is is also a very, very strange film, hard to rate and even more difficult to categorize. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.John Klute (Donald Sutherland) is a private detective based in the good town of Tuscarora, PA. Recently, an old friend of his, Tom Gruneman, disappeared without a trace during a business trip to New York and the police was unable to find him. Tom's wife Holly and his business partner, Peter Cable, hire Klute to find him. It seems to be a very difficult investigation, considering that the only lead is a letter which Tom supposedly addressed to an expensive call girl named Bree Daniel (Jane Fonda) - or this woman is absolutely uncooperative and initially refuses even to talk to Klute...As I already mentioned, this film is very hard to categorize. It begins like a kind of neo-film noir, but then quickly turns rather into a kind of psychological drama mixed with soft porn. And even if the criminal mystery retains its importance to the end, it is the relationship between Klute and Bree that is the central element of the film. Also, the title is, maybe on purpose, confusing, as it appears quite quickly that it is not Klute but Bree who is the real main character of the film.The character of Bree is somehow disturbing. She is an extremely attractive woman per se, but the way she talks and the things she says add even more to the already explosive melange - in fact, she is an almost perfect temptress. With her looks and wits she could very easily abandon prostitution and become the trophy wife of some obscenely rich guy - but it seems that for her turning tricks is a kind of compulsion. This obsessional need felt by Bree to sell herself, sometimes in fact rather cheap if it is a slow day, is a rather disturbing thing and it makes the watching of this film by moments slightly uncomfortable. Clearly, somebody one day damaged this incredibly beautiful woman so badly, that it seems doubtful that she can ever recover.Klute is clearly also damaged goods, although he is without a doubt a redoubtable and efficient investigator, certainly too good for the relatively little town from which he comes. But his relations with people and especially with women are DEFINITELY not easy and comfortable. Therefore, this film is mostly about two very different, very badly scarred and damaged and very, very insecure and suspicious people who engage in long, slow and complicated seduction/rejection dance, with a mixture of care and dare which made me think of a mating ritual between two badly wounded porcupines...)))It is a strange, even weird film, with a unique, unsettling atmosphere and some pretty steamy scenes and Jane Fonda very deservedly got an Oscar for this role - although her backless dress certainly helped her a lot in it...)))I am ultimately rather glad that I finally discovered this movie and I think I will keep the DVD for a possible another watching - but it will not be before some time.

231915,A2R1GFS6P1PC18,6300268063,Peter Baklava,"[2, 2]","""Klute"" is a simple stalker movie, novel at the time (1971) for its unusually frank exploration of the amoral life of a New York City call girl.  When John Klute (Donald Sutherland) is assigned to stake out Bree Daniels (Jane Fonda), a freelancing street hooker, he is trying to solve the disappearance of a personal business friend. When Klute realizes that Bree Daniels is also under the surveillance of a psychopath, he intercedes to become her protector.The chemistry between Klute the investigator and Daniels the prostitute/aspiring actress is what fuels the movie.  Both characters are people locked in their shells.  Daniels, as played by Jane Fonda, is dedicated to keeping herself free of emotional entanglements, after breaking free from her procurer (Roy Scheider, in an early film role.)  She is also, oddly enough, sort of a feminist role model, as a free thinking independent.  (Believe me, plenty of teenage girls adopted the pert shag haircut and miniskirt ensemble that Fonda modeled in this movie.)Sutherland's ""John Klute"" on the other hand, is startling for his fresh-scrubbed incorruptibility.  Previously having played something of a hipster in ""MASH"" and other films--- in ""Klute"", Sutherland looks like a nerd that just stepped out of high school.  He's ""all ears"" in his short haircut, and a picture of awkwardness as he sets up shop in a bare room beneath Bree Daniels apartment in order to eavesdrop on her.The movie is about the state of relations between the sexes as much as it is about endangerment.  Bree Daniels is a new kind of woman (she is one of the first women on screen to say the ""f-word""), but she is troubled by the double life that she leads, and spends a lot of time with a female psychoanalyst.  John Klute is wooden, but markedly more sensitive than the cops/investigators played in other films from this period, like ""Bullitt"", ""French Connection"" or ""The Boston Strangler"".  Klute, it turns out, has just the sort of patience required to crack Ms. Daniels' frosty faade, in what finally boils down to a story about pervasive loneliness within the cold lives of people in the big city.As for the bogeyman shadowing Bree Daniels, the movie steadfastly moves toward unveiling his identity, so the reveal in the end is hardly a surprise. The suspense is built up in the film as the harasser remains hidden, made known only by heavy-breathing phone calls, strange noises, and camera shots from the peeping tom's perspective.  For Bree Daniels (as for all single women) the quandary is in knowing who to trust---when both the good and the bad guy are strangers who are watching her from a distance, as she sits in solitude.One of the most effective things about this movie is its non-intrusive, minimalist musical score.  The stalker's movements are evoked by a spidery ascension of notes on a percussion instrument.  Other themes incorporate a sighing, lamentatory female vocal, a dulcimer, and a sad jazz trumpet motif.This movie is a triumph of style and suggestion rather than action.Keep your eyes peeled for an effective appearance by Jean Stapleton (better known as television's ""Edith Bunker"") in the role of a secretary.",4,"Subdued, Yet Sinister",1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,3172,"['Klute', 'simple', 'stalker', 'movie', 'novel', 'time', '1971', 'unusually', 'frank', 'exploration', 'amoral', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'call', 'girl', 'When', 'John', 'Klute', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'assigned', 'stake', 'out', 'Bree', 'Daniels', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'freelancing', 'street', 'hooker', 'trying', 'solve', 'disappearance', 'personal', 'business', 'friend', 'When', 'Klute', 'Bree', 'Daniels', 'also', 'surveillance', 'psychopath', 'become', 'protector.The', 'chemistry', 'Klute', 'investigator', 'Daniels', 'prostitute/aspiring', 'actress', 'what', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'people', 'locked', 'shells', 'Daniels', 'played', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'dedicated', 'keeping', 'free', 'emotional', 'entanglements', 'breaking', 'free', 'procurer', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'early', 'film', 'role', 'also', 'oddly', 'enough', 'sort', 'feminist', 'role', 'model', 'free', 'thinking', 'independent', 'Believe', 'plenty', 'teenage', 'girls', 'adopted', 'pert', 'shag', 'haircut', 'miniskirt', 'ensemble', 'Fonda', 'modeled', 'movie', 'Sutherland', 'John', 'Klute', 'other', 'hand', 'startling', 'fresh-scrubbed', 'incorruptibility', 'Previously', 'having', 'played', 'something', 'hipster', 'MASH', 'other', 'films', 'Klute', 'Sutherland', 'nerd', 'just', 'stepped', 'high', 'school', 'ears', 'short', 'haircut', 'picture', 'awkwardness', 'up', 'shop', 'bare', 'room', 'beneath', 'Bree', 'Daniels', 'apartment', 'order', 'eavesdrop', 'her.The', 'movie', 'state', 'relations', 'sexes', 'as', 'much', 'endangerment', 'Bree', 'Daniels', 'new', 'kind', 'woman', 'one', 'first', 'women', 'screen', 'say', 'f-word', 'troubled', 'double', 'life', 'lot', 'time', 'female', 'psychoanalyst', 'John', 'Klute', 'wooden', 'markedly', 'more', 'sensitive', 'cops/investigators', 'played', 'other', 'films', 'period', 'Bullitt', 'French', 'Connection', 'Boston', 'Strangler', 'Klute', 'out', 'just', 'sort', 'patience', 'required', 'crack', 'Ms.', 'Daniels', 'frosty', 'faade', 'what', 'finally', 'down', 'story', 'pervasive', 'loneliness', 'cold', 'lives', 'people', 'big', 'city.As', 'bogeyman', 'shadowing', 'Bree', 'Daniels', 'movie', 'steadfastly', 'unveiling', 'identity', 'reveal', 'end', 'hardly', 'surprise', 'suspense', 'built', 'up', 'film', 'harasser', 'hidden', 'made', 'known', 'only', 'heavy-breathing', 'phone', 'calls', 'strange', 'noises', 'camera', 'shots', 'peeping', 'tom', 'perspective', 'Bree', 'Daniels', 'single', 'women', 'quandary', 'knowing', 'who', 'trust', '-when', 'good', 'bad', 'guy', 'are', 'strangers', 'who', 'are', 'watching', 'distance', 'solitude.One', 'most', 'effective', 'things', 'movie', 'non-intrusive', 'minimalist', 'musical', 'score', 'stalker', 'movements', 'are', 'evoked', 'spidery', 'ascension', 'notes', 'percussion', 'instrument', 'Other', 'themes', 'incorporate', 'sighing', 'lamentatory', 'female', 'vocal', 'dulcimer', 'sad', 'jazz', 'trumpet', 'motif.This', 'movie', 'triumph', 'style', 'suggestion', 'rather', 'action.Keep', 'eyes', 'peeled', 'effective', 'appearance', 'Jean', 'Stapleton', 'better', 'known', 'television', 'Edith', 'Bunker', 'role', 'secretary']",N/A

In Klute, she showed off some serious acting chops as Bree, the hooker being stalked by a killer.  Ms. Fonda perfectly conveys the emotional distance of a prostitute especially in one scene where she mechanically goes through the emotions with a customer.

Pakula, 1971)Pakula's second film, Klute is considered one of the classic pieces of seventies cinema, but as another reviewer recently said, ""Klute is one of those films you always hear about but never actually watch."" The penultimate script for both Andy and Dave Lewis (the latter's final script was for the disaster-of-the-week flick City of Fire; the former's final script was for the potboiler Big Rose: Double Trouble. In an odd coincidence, both films star Shelley Winters.) was Oscar-nominated for best screenplay, losing to Paddy Chayefsky's The Hospital. Jane Fonda, of course, took home the other Oscar the film was nominated for-- Best Actress.The story follows private detective John Klute (Donald Sutherland), who's been hired by businessman Peter Cable (Charles Cioffi) to find a missing business partner. Klute's invesitgation takes him to New York City, where he traces the missing guy to high-class prostitute Bree (Fonda). Klute and Bree start working together, but the closer they get to figuring out what's going on, the more people start turning up dead.As a mystery/thriller, it's certainly not bad. It does seem to overplay the whole frankness approach, which could be considered a side-effect of the time the film was made (remember that in 1971, the MPAA had only been around for three years, and mainstream filmmakers were still far more interested in pushing the boundaries than they are today); looking back at it from this distance, it makes the film appear somewhat dated. Still, if you ignore that, it's a well-shot film with a passel of good-to-great performances (Roy Schieder is fantastically grungy in a small role as Bree's pimp/swinger friend Frank Ligourin). Hard to believe Pakula, who would go on to direct some of the seventies' finest Hollywood efforts, was still basically a rookie here.

The character on whom the audience focuses is that of the intelligent call girl, played by Fonda...Jane Fonda shows a complete understanding of her character, presenting Bree as a methodical call girl whose confident outward persona is nothing but a suitable mask to cover her true vulnerable identity... She is a high class hooker who finds difficult to accept a relationship which she considers a threat to her independence...As the film develops we see that the opinion of her helpful analyst is not strictly correct... Bree is a woman who cannot allow herself to be dominated by men, much less given herself to them... Her defense is her expertise as a sexual actress... Since she is skilled in manipulating the fantasies of her clients, (she takes drugs and likes being in control), she does not allow them to gain control over her by giving her pleasure... So when she felt a special attraction to John Klute, she attempts to sabotage her relationship with him... She wanted to corrupt the decent man, to prove that he is really like the 'others' she knew...All along, the tough image she presents is balanced by glimpses of her true loneliness and a 'cry' for something like a normal life... For this reason the importance of the lone cop and private eye in her life...Accompanying him on his investigation, she begins to see her world through his highly moral eyes... She realizes that it is uglier than she had dared to recognize as true... In effect, she shows her what her fate will be if she does not finally learn to give herself to someone...Her progress toward a solution of the enigma of her personality, parallels his improvement in the solution of the criminal mystery he is investigating... The simultaneous answer to both 'problems' makes Pakula's 'Klute' a distinctive film...Fonda's eloquent and brilliant performance was one of the decade's best...It shows us a sympathetic portrait largely from the feminine point of view... The film works fruitfully as a study of voyeurism (the killer as the cop's alter ego) and leads us deep into the world of New York call-girls, pimps and drug addicts, but never needlessly violent or brutal, with intelligent compassion and honest humanity...

231930,A2CDMCG1Z84A51,6300268063,Wanda B. Red,"[8, 8]","I first watched this film decades ago. All I remembered were scattered scenes -- and a misimpression that the title character Klute was the call girl (actually ""Bree Daniels""); Klute of course is John Klute, the police officer turned private detective whose life becomes entangled with Bree's as he seeks her help to locate his friend who has gone missing for a year.I mention this faulty memory because I believe that it's the Bree character who endures from this film, for most viewers and in our cultural memory. That's not because the male actors are unmemorable; Donald Sutherland and Roy Scheider especially are magnetic in this film. It's simply that Bree takes the story over.The film's voyeuristic photographic sequences make her, as film critics would say, the object of the male gaze here. But then something remarkable also happens. She gazes back. The story is as much about her manipulating the male characters as it is about the way that they stalk her (which certainly they do). As Bree wanders through a garment factory surrounded by manikins on her way to deliver a fantasy to an old man who will never touch her, the message is patently that she, like these fabricated models, is a shell -- a ghost-voice recorded on the audiotape reels that cycle through this film like black crepe paper in a French Quarter funeral (and the funeral parlor next to her apartment is of course another such symbol).Ultimately, however, for all her posing, Jane Fonda's richly androgynous portrayal of the call girl Bree Daniels is larger than anything else in this daring film, and the sound of her voice (""Nothing is wrong -- let it all hang out"") echoes frighteningly down the decades.
