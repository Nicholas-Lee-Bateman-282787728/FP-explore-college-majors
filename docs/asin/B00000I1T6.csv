[I would recommend it to all Ichi fans] Draw your own conclusions. However, it is a very mediocre and not a very good episode. But,after 18 previous epsisodes there are bound to be a few that fall through the crack. Some will like this episode, I feel it fell below the series standards.Zatoichi is a member of the yakuza, and this is made clear in this episode. When he is ordered to kill a man that owes a gambling debt, then he must. However, the man he kills is innocent. Ichi attempts to make amends with the sister of the man he killed. Yet there never seems to be any 'chemistry' between the two as one of the reviewers below has written. Also, the fight scenes are not that very good in this episode. Not that this makes that much of a difference if the storyline is well written and acted. [Episode #1 is a very good example]The interaction between Osode an Zatoichi is where the film falls apart: From her constantly refusing to listen to Ichi, to the major point that the characters just don't gel. Zatoichi does not seem to have much enthusiasm in this episode as in previous ones. Watch the film by all means. It's not bad. It just isn't that good either.",3,#19: ZATOICHI IN DISTRESS!,1157068800,"09 1, 2006",2006,1363,"['was', 'never', 'one', 'favorite', 'Zatoichi', 'episodes', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'therefore', 'would', 'not', 'tell', 'viewers', 'not', 'watch', 'however', 'did', 'not', 'appeal', '[', 'would', 'recommend', 'Ichi', 'fans', ']', 'Draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'However', 'very', 'mediocre', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'episode', '18', 'previous', 'epsisodes', 'are', 'bound', 'be', 'few', 'fall', 'crack', 'will', 'like', 'episode', 'feel', 'fell', 'series', 'standards.Zatoichi', 'member', 'yakuza', 'made', 'clear', 'episode', 'When', 'ordered', 'kill', 'man', 'gambling', 'debt', 'then', 'must', 'However', 'man', 'innocent', 'Ichi', 'make', 'amends', 'sister', 'man', 'killed', 'never', 'be', ""'chemistry"", 'two', 'one', 'reviewers', 'written', 'Also', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'episode', 'Not', 'much', 'difference', 'storyline', 'well', 'written', 'acted', '[', 'Episode', '1', 'very', 'good', 'example', ']', 'interaction', 'Osode', 'Zatoichi', 'where', 'film', 'apart', 'constantly', 'refusing', 'listen', 'Ichi', 'major', 'point', 'characters', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'gel', 'Zatoichi', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'much', 'enthusiasm', 'episode', 'previous', 'ones', 'Watch', 'film', 'means', 'not', 'bad', 'just', ""n't"", 'that', 'good']",N/A

Zatoichi takes a job to kill a guy who has gambling debt to one of the local boss.  But it really is the sister of the gambler who the boss wants.  In the end the man is killed and the sister has to make a run for it - with Zatoichi's help.  A somewhat twisted tale really and feels a tad off.

502004,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B00000I1T6,Zack Davisson,"[23, 23]","In a series as long as Zatoichi, there are bound to be a few that fall short of excellence.  Unfortunately, ""Samaritan Zatoichi"" (original title ""Zatichi kenka-daiko"" or ""Zatoichi and the Fighting Drums"") is a pretty mediocre entry, one that never really delivers or summons up that entertaining mix of charm, humor and action that is the hallmark of the Zatoichi series.The story starts off with an interesting premise.  Zatoichi, lured by obligation to the Yakuza brotherhood, assassinates a wild gambler who hasn't paid his debts.  The whole thing turns out to be a sham, calculated to get the gambler's sister working in the local brothel to pay off her brother's debts.  The girl, Sode, flees, and Zatoichi sets himself up as the girl's bodyguard, feeling obligated for her current dilemma.  Of course, a mysteriously powerful samurai dogs the tracks of Zatoichi and Sode, sometimes lending assistance but promising a future showdown.While the plot is pretty by-the-numbers, that has never hindered a good Zatoichi flick.  What is really lacking is the chemistry between Zatoichi and Sode, who never seem to click.  Sode is also almost too stupid, refusing Zatoichi's help over and over again even though he rescues her from constant danger.  The big blow-out at the end takes place in a darkened brothel, which seems like a nice twist but comes off awkward as the director tries to keep up with the action in the dark.Director Kenji Misumi has a great pedigree, having directed the first two Zatoichi films as well as the memorable ""Zatoichi and the Fire Festival.""  However, this time he just doesn't pull it off.  By no means a bad flick, but on the lower level of the series.",3,Assassin and Samaritan,1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,1684,"['series', 'as', 'long', 'Zatoichi', 'are', 'bound', 'be', 'few', 'fall', 'short', 'excellence', 'Unfortunately', 'Samaritan', 'Zatoichi', 'original', 'title', 'Zatichi', 'kenka-daiko', 'Zatoichi', 'Fighting', 'Drums', 'pretty', 'mediocre', 'entry', 'one', 'never', 'really', 'delivers', 'summons', 'up', 'entertaining', 'mix', 'charm', 'humor', 'action', 'hallmark', 'Zatoichi', 'series.The', 'story', 'off', 'interesting', 'premise', 'Zatoichi', 'lured', 'obligation', 'Yakuza', 'brotherhood', 'wild', 'gambler', 'who', ""n't"", 'paid', 'debts', 'whole', 'thing', 'out', 'be', 'sham', 'calculated', 'get', 'gambler', 'sister', 'working', 'local', 'brothel', 'pay', 'off', 'brother', 'debts', 'girl', 'Sode', 'flees', 'Zatoichi', 'sets', 'up', 'girl', 'bodyguard', 'feeling', 'obligated', 'current', 'dilemma', 'course', 'mysteriously', 'powerful', 'samurai', 'dogs', 'tracks', 'Zatoichi', 'Sode', 'sometimes', 'lending', 'assistance', 'promising', 'future', 'plot', 'pretty', 'by-the-numbers', 'never', 'hindered', 'good', 'Zatoichi', 'flick', 'What', 'really', 'lacking', 'chemistry', 'Zatoichi', 'Sode', 'who', 'never', 'seem', 'click', 'Sode', 'also', 'almost', 'too', 'stupid', 'refusing', 'Zatoichi', 'help', 'over', 'again', 'even', 'constant', 'danger', 'big', 'blow-out', 'end', 'place', 'darkened', 'brothel', 'nice', 'twist', 'off', 'awkward', 'director', 'keep', 'up', 'action', 'dark.Director', 'Kenji', 'Misumi', 'great', 'pedigree', 'having', 'directed', 'first', 'two', 'Zatoichi', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'memorable', 'Zatoichi', 'Fire', 'Festival', 'However', 'time', 'just', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'bad', 'flick', 'lower', 'level', 'series']",N/A
