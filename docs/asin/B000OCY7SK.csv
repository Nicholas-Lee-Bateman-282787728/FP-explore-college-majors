1063625,A2HHGOXPOWJHBP,B000OCY7SK,Anne Marie Martin,"[20, 20]",I like these two women and they work well together in movies.  Again they team up to share a good story line based on a true story.  Melissa Gilbert plays a single mother of an autistic boy who doesn't speak.  The father is hardly around even though he is portrayed as being somewhat interested in his son.  The mother puts the boy into a school to see if they can teach him to communicate and the teacher is played by Patty Duke.  The two women's characters collide over what is best for the boy but they unite when they realize that one of the boy's teachers has molested him.  It portrays the struggles that the boy and family went through as the court proceedings develop.  A very touching story and worth watching.,5,Patty Duke/Melissa Gilbert Does It Again!,1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,719,"['like', 'two', 'women', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'movies', 'Again', 'team', 'up', 'share', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Melissa', 'Gilbert', 'single', 'mother', 'autistic', 'boy', 'who', ""n't"", 'speak', 'father', 'hardly', 'around', 'even', 'portrayed', 'being', 'somewhat', 'interested', 'son', 'mother', 'boy', 'school', 'see', 'can', 'teach', 'communicate', 'teacher', 'played', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'two', 'women', 'characters', 'collide', 'what', 'best', 'boy', 'unite', 'when', 'realize', 'one', 'boy', 'teachers', 'molested', 'struggles', 'boy', 'family', 'went', 'court', 'proceedings', 'develop', 'very', 'touching', 'story', 'worth', 'watching']",Touch of Truth

It touches your heart when you think of a child (and there are many), who are not able to communicate what or how they feel. This boy was finally able to 'talk' about his abusive caregiver.

1063627,A3MNJL4ROH6LRW,B000OCY7SK,Don R. Holloway,"[0, 0]","""Touch of Truth"" is a movie about an autistic boy (played by Bradley Pierce) who doesn't speak and exhibits repetitive motions common to autistic children. The boy's mother (played by Melissa Gilbert) has given her all to the care of her son. But she lacks the professional knowledge to help him progress from where he is. Eventually, she is convinced that her son can receive the help he needs at a special school for children with various kinds of developmental disabilities. She meets with the psychologist (played by Patty Duke) who believes she can help the boy. Afterwards, the mother enrolls her son in the school. This was a general overview of what the movie is about. It is difficult to describe in words just how emotionally heartbreaking this film is, and yet how beautiful it is at the same time. Melissa Gilbert gives such a strong performance that when you see how intimately she relates to her son, it's hard to believe she is not his real mother. The tremendous amount of love and understanding and affection that she shows her son is just an awesome and beautiful thing to witness. And the boy is such a beautiful child, and so sweet and innocent, it's impossible not to fall in love with him from the first minute you see him. And the psychologist who wants to help the boy expresses genuine concern for his well-being, and for the mother's initial doubts. There are several instances where the mother and the psychologist find themselves in disagreement over what is best for the boy. But they manage to work through these difficulties because it is obvious that they both want what is best for the boy. Then the unexpected happens: the boy's emotional condition worsens for no apparent reason, but he has no way of communicating to anyone what he is feeling. Finally, using a controversial technique called facilitated communication, the psychologist gives the boy ""a voice"" so he can let them know what is wrong. And slowly, the horrible truth comes out: the boy has been molested by one of the male workers at the school. Of course, this necessitates the involvement of law enforcement and the district attorney. Then the mother is given more unsettling news: in order to get a conviction against this molestor, this young autistic boy must testify in open court. No one is sure if he is capable of doing it. But the boy tells them that he wants to do it. What ensues is a court trial that is unprecedented in scope and procedure. I will not try to describe the remaining events as the details are to numerous and complicated. Instead, I want to describe the depth of emotion shown by all the characters here. There is just so much warmth and love and compassion in this movie right from the start. I think I cried through most of the movie. But also I was genuinely angry and repulsed that someone could molest this sweet, beautiful and innocent child. I felt so much hatred for that man who violated the trust that this child had in him. I really felt like if I had been there, I might have tried to kill this man. I know that sounds awful, but I couldn't help feeling this way. I really loved that little boy just like his mother and his teacher did and I couldn't understand how someone could do something so horrible to him. I know this is only a movie, but if you watch it, you will come away feeling like it was so much more. You can take my word for that.",5,A Beautiful But Emotionally Draining Movie,1316649600,"09 22, 2011",2011,3386,"['Touch', 'Truth', 'movie', 'autistic', 'boy', 'played', 'Bradley', 'Pierce', 'who', ""n't"", 'speak', 'exhibits', 'repetitive', 'motions', 'common', 'autistic', 'children', 'boy', 'mother', 'played', 'Melissa', 'Gilbert', 'given', 'care', 'son', 'professional', 'knowledge', 'help', 'progress', 'where', 'Eventually', 'convinced', 'son', 'can', 'receive', 'help', 'special', 'school', 'children', 'various', 'kinds', 'developmental', 'disabilities', 'psychologist', 'played', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'boy', 'Afterwards', 'mother', 'son', 'school', 'was', 'general', 'overview', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'difficult', 'describe', 'words', 'just', 'how', 'emotionally', 'heartbreaking', 'film', 'yet', 'how', 'beautiful', 'same', 'time', 'Melissa', 'Gilbert', 'strong', 'performance', 'when', 'see', 'how', 'intimately', 'son', 'hard', 'believe', 'not', 'real', 'mother', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'love', 'understanding', 'affection', 'son', 'just', 'awesome', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'witness', 'boy', 'such', 'beautiful', 'child', 'so', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'impossible', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'first', 'minute', 'see', 'psychologist', 'who', 'help', 'boy', 'genuine', 'concern', 'well-being', 'mother', 'initial', 'doubts', 'are', 'several', 'instances', 'where', 'mother', 'psychologist', 'find', 'disagreement', 'what', 'best', 'boy', 'manage', 'work', 'difficulties', 'obvious', 'want', 'what', 'best', 'boy', 'Then', 'unexpected', 'happens', 'boy', 'emotional', 'condition', 'worsens', 'apparent', 'reason', 'way', 'communicating', 'anyone', 'what', 'feeling', 'Finally', 'using', 'controversial', 'technique', 'called', 'facilitated', 'communication', 'psychologist', 'boy', 'voice', 'can', 'let', 'know', 'what', 'wrong', 'slowly', 'horrible', 'truth', 'out', 'boy', 'been', 'molested', 'one', 'male', 'workers', 'school', 'course', 'involvement', 'law', 'enforcement', 'district', 'attorney', 'Then', 'mother', 'given', 'more', 'unsettling', 'news', 'order', 'get', 'conviction', 'molestor', 'young', 'autistic', 'boy', 'must', 'testify', 'open', 'court', 'one', 'sure', 'capable', 'doing', 'boy', 'do', 'What', 'court', 'trial', 'unprecedented', 'scope', 'procedure', 'will', 'not', 'try', 'describe', 'remaining', 'events', 'details', 'are', 'numerous', 'complicated', 'Instead', 'want', 'describe', 'depth', 'emotion', 'shown', 'characters', 'here', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'warmth', 'love', 'compassion', 'movie', 'right', 'start', 'think', 'cried', 'most', 'movie', 'also', 'was', 'genuinely', 'angry', 'repulsed', 'someone', 'could', 'molest', 'sweet', 'beautiful', 'innocent', 'child', 'felt', 'so', 'much', 'hatred', 'man', 'who', 'violated', 'trust', 'child', 'had', 'really', 'felt', 'had', 'been', 'there', 'might', 'have', 'tried', 'kill', 'man', 'know', 'awful', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'way', 'really', 'loved', 'little', 'boy', 'just', 'mother', 'teacher', 'did', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'someone', 'could', 'do', 'something', 'so', 'horrible', 'know', 'only', 'movie', 'watch', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'feeling', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'take', 'word']",Touch of Truth
