1005528,A1JVG2EUDNQ3HT,B000GNOH82,shelly v,"[2, 2]","McLeod's Daughters is one of Australia's best-loved shows and is either in its 7th or 8th season there, but its first few seasons are generally considered its best.  Bouncy and sweet-natured city girl Tess arrives at her late father Jack McLeod's country estate of Drover's Run expecting a warm welcome from her half sister Claire and a sizable enough inheritance to go back to the city and start her dream of owning a cafe.  But the only welcome she gets is the cold realization that Drover's Run is far from rolling in it, and an even colder response from fierce, smart Claire because their father willed half his property to Tess, who hasn't set her foot on the farm in years.  Will Claire and Tess (with a little help from Meg, their housekeeper/mother figure, her spoiled daughter Jodi, and Becky, the local girl with a trashy reputation) put aside their differences so they can come together and save their father's legacy?I'm sure you can predict the answer is yes, but it's the way this show goes about portraying it.  The first few seasons of McLeod's Daughters have everything it needs to be completely engrossing - emotional but funny, warm but witty.  What struck me most about this show is how REAL it seems - you become so involved in these characters and their lives that you think you've got a window on actual people and not actors speaking lines.  The sets help; the property that is ""Drover's Run"" was an actual property in the Australian outback that the creators bought to film the show.  But so does the writing and the acting - aside from the 5-women main cast, standouts include Marshall Napier as Harry Ryan, the somewhat nice but usually nasty neighbor of the McLeod women who has his eyes set on acquiring Drover's, and his gorgeous sons, Alex and Nick.  And yes, if you guessed that the men provide plenty of love interest material, you'd be right, but they provide lots of other things like humor, too.  My favorite is Jessica Napier as Becky, the classic underdog character of the story, but the show always makes Becky out to be strong and independent, never whiny or weak.The one thing I didn't care for in this first season was a story arc concerning Becky that goes longer than I thought necessary and pushes the show into somewhat soap-ish territory.  MD is considered a soap, not a drama, but in its first few seasons I really do think its storylines are more dramatic than soapy.Bottom line being, buy this show.  As someone who loves adventure and fantasy shows and hates dramas, I LOVE this show.
