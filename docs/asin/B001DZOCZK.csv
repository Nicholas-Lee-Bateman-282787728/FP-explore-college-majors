Someone made sure they got the colors right because the clothes of the characters and their make-up match color photos I have seen perfectly. After viewing this color episode, I went to the black and white episode of the same show, and missed the color! This series is perfect in black and white and yet I think a lot of people will enjoy seeing this episode in color. I highly recommend buying it.

I don't have a problem with Universal putting out a single disc featuring the newly colorized version (along with original black and white version) of a 1st season episode of The Munsters. This allows people who already bought the two seasons of the TV series to bypass buying the complete series set. But for crying out loud! A list price of $19.98 and a selling price of $14 for one episode in two formats? What greed! This disc should have a list of $9.98.

None of the backgrounds or long shots have ""color"". It seems that just the actors and some foreground objects have been colourized...So basically the overall feeling you get is frustration. Why ruin a classsic in this way. More than anything, it's an obstruction to the enjoyment of the episode...I say stick with the classic B/W version. Get the box set. Then sit back and laugh out loud. The Munsters are and always will be a classic show. 5 stars for The Munsters.

It doesn't look like it was computer generated. What puzzles me is why the people who put this together chose ""Family Portrait"" as the episode to colorize. While it's not a bad episode, it's far from being one of the best (a better choice would have been ""Grandpa's Call Of the wild"", or ""Hermans Happy Valley""). Perhaps they chose it because it was Beverley Owen's last episode before she left the show. Also, why is there only one episode? Considering this, the current price of $15 is a little steep. You may want to wait until the price drops to around $10, as I did.Still, a must for any fan of The Munsters.
