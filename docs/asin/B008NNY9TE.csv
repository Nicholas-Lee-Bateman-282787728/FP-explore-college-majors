1572004,A3K9IWKXXWAP24,B008NNY9TE,3D Blu-Ray,"[6, 15]","Ok lets be honest, all 3 of these movies kinda sucked.  All they did was take out the commercials so 20% of each 45 minute show is recapping like we're total idiots.  I wouldnt want to pay more than $10 for History Of The World In Two Hours 3D only because it wasnt even 90 minutes and they said that phrase about 112 times.  Add another $15 for WWII3D only for the few shots in 3D we got to see and some nice info.  The other $10 would be for Titanic 100 Years in 3D because its basically bonus features from other releases and since i have all the other releases I felt ripped off in a big way.  So  when you add those up its $35 and one guy has it new for $35.97.  So i gave it 5 stars just because its a deal on content.  Or you can wait until these are on TV and tell your TV to convert it to 3D...its about the same depth.  nothing special.",5,Good Price,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,846,"['Ok', 'lets', 'be', 'honest', '3', 'movies', 'kinda', 'sucked', 'did', 'was', 'take', 'out', 'commercials', 'so', '20', '%', '45', 'minute', 'show', 'recapping', ""'re"", 'total', 'idiots', 'wouldnt', 'want', 'pay', 'more', '10', 'History', 'World', 'Two', '3D', 'only', 'wasnt', 'even', '90', 'minutes', 'said', 'phrase', '112', 'times', 'Add', '15', 'WWII3D', 'only', 'few', 'shots', '3D', 'got', 'see', 'nice', 'info', 'other', '10', 'would', 'be', 'Titanic', '100', 'Years', '3D', 'basically', 'bonus', 'features', 'other', 'releases', 'i', 'have', 'other', 'releases', 'felt', 'ripped', 'off', 'big', 'way', 'So', 'when', 'add', '35', 'one', 'guy', 'new', '35.97', 'i', 'gave', '5', 'stars', 'just', 'deal', 'content', 'can', 'wait', 'are', 'TV', 'tell', 'TV', 'convert', '3D', 'same', 'depth', 'nothing', 'special']",History in 3D

The 3D effects of Titanic are incredible. They make it with real 3D cameras and is under the water. Wow! I dont know that the nazi make a 3D propaganda movie and you will see this movie here and it look real real... Three time wow.
