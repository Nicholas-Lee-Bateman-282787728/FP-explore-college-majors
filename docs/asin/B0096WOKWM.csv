1586553,A1TUPUD0LJR5UP,B0096WOKWM,"Adriana Dos Santos ""Ichabod Crane""","[1, 1]","I loved this DVD set, but I really want to point some things out. The yoga series are great, Tara Stiles&#8217; performance is graceful and balanced, and the sceneries change from the usual landscapes (sometimes beautifully boring) to the city at night, for example. I found this pretty original; I think the point is to show a yoga practice for the real life. Of course, you can practice by the beach before sunset in Bahamas if you are able to, but your everyday &#8211;real- practice is going to be less fancy, and Tara makes this somehow special. Beginners may find the poses and series very challenging and a bit fast. I would like to recommend them to watch the DVDs entirely, before picking up a flow and take it at their own pace, with respect for their bodies, being patient and trying to avoid frustration. For some reviewers, Tara talks way too much and fast. This may be annoying at first, but when you try to follow her, the instructions and encouraging that she gives are both clear and helpful. Please try her YouTube channel first, if you have doubts. I also recommend watching the DVDs in your computer first, because some of the series were not correctly timed. This is a weakness, because you can&#8217;t choose a flow of &#8220;15 minutes&#8221; if you are short of time for the practice without checking it out, or you can be late for work and stressed for the rest of the day. Lastly, I think the 4th DVD (library pose) is the most helpful for beginners, because it offers a variety of modifications, which can lead them into the full pose in the future. I would have LOVED this DVD (and I&#8217;d rated this set with 5 stars no matter what), if it had some kind of interactive menu of &#8220;matrix&#8221;, because you can&#8217;t pick up a pose without watching the rest of the DVD chapter. With this pros and cons, I rated this set with 4 stars, feeling a little short, because Tara&#8217;s work worth 5.",4,4 STARS (AND A HALF),1378857600,"09 11, 2013",2013,1929,"['loved', 'DVD', 'set', 'really', 'want', 'point', 'things', 'out', 'yoga', 'series', 'are', 'great', 'Tara', 'Stiles', '8217', 'performance', 'graceful', 'balanced', 'sceneries', 'change', 'usual', 'landscapes', 'sometimes', 'beautifully', 'boring', 'city', 'night', 'example', 'found', 'pretty', 'original', 'think', 'point', 'show', 'yoga', 'practice', 'real', 'life', 'course', 'can', 'practice', 'beach', 'sunset', 'Bahamas', 'are', 'able', 'everyday', '8211', 'real-', 'practice', 'going', 'be', 'less', 'fancy', 'Tara', 'somehow', 'special', 'Beginners', 'may', 'find', 'poses', 'series', 'very', 'challenging', 'bit', 'fast', 'would', 'like', 'recommend', 'watch', 'DVDs', 'entirely', 'picking', 'up', 'flow', 'take', 'own', 'pace', 'respect', 'bodies', 'being', 'patient', 'trying', 'avoid', 'frustration', 'reviewers', 'Tara', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'fast', 'may', 'be', 'annoying', 'first', 'when', 'try', 'follow', 'instructions', 'encouraging', 'are', 'clear', 'helpful', 'Please', 'try', 'YouTube', 'channel', 'first', 'have', 'doubts', 'also', 'recommend', 'watching', 'DVDs', 'computer', 'first', 'series', 'were', 'not', 'correctly', 'timed', 'weakness', 'can', '8217', 'choose', 'flow', '8220', '15', 'minutes', '8221', 'are', 'short', 'time', 'practice', 'checking', 'out', 'can', 'be', 'late', 'work', 'stressed', 'rest', 'day', 'Lastly', 'think', '4th', 'DVD', 'library', 'pose', 'most', 'helpful', 'beginners', 'variety', 'modifications', 'can', 'lead', 'full', 'pose', 'future', 'would', 'have', 'LOVED', 'DVD', '8217', 'd', 'rated', 'set', '5', 'stars', 'matter', 'what', 'had', 'kind', 'interactive', 'menu', '8220', '8221', 'can', '8217', 'pick', 'up', 'pose', 'watching', 'rest', 'DVD', 'chapter', 'pros', 'cons', 'rated', 'set', '4', 'stars', 'feeling', 'little', 'short', 'Tara', '8217', 's', 'work', 'worth', '5']",Tara Stiles This is Yoga Set : Complete Yoga Encyclopedia: Daily Yoga + Beginners Yoga + AM/PM Yoga + Complete Yoga Library for Everyone
1586554,A2FMPWCAQSQJ2E,B0096WOKWM,Amazon Customer,"[28, 33]","I think Tara is very cool and inspiring. I was very excited to get this set. However, my main complaint is, it was difficult to figure out which workout listed on the DVD goes with which description and time on the back. The majority of workouts did not match the times given on the cover and it would have been nice to see the (correct) times on the menu when playing the DVD. Like another reviewer said, a 15 minute routine was really 30 or more, etc. Also, the title or description on the DVD did not match what it was called on the back of the cover (where the times are listed). I exercise before I go to work and time it accordingly. I had to break it off in the middle on several routines because of this inaccuracy. At first I thought I just got confused, but realized something was off. Also, the way the library DVD is done I didn't care for. She shows a lot of poses, but on one side only. So, if you follow along you would have to do the other side on your own or replay the DVD. Or, if you want to do both sides for a pose you would have to pause the DVD after each pose. The 20 minute routine on this DVD is also longer than even 30 minutes which is when I stopped. Although a bargain, I felt this set could have been organized better. The instruction is Tara's typical style, she will talk continuously and fast which I don't mind but it might not be everyone's taste.",3,"Ok, but Confusing",1352160000,"11 6, 2012",2012,1383,"['think', 'Tara', 'very', 'cool', 'inspiring', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'get', 'set', 'However', 'main', 'complaint', 'was', 'difficult', 'figure', 'out', 'workout', 'listed', 'DVD', 'description', 'time', 'back', 'majority', 'workouts', 'did', 'not', 'match', 'times', 'given', 'cover', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'correct', 'times', 'menu', 'when', 'playing', 'DVD', 'reviewer', 'said', '15', 'minute', 'routine', 'was', 'really', '30', 'more', 'etc', 'Also', 'title', 'description', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'match', 'what', 'was', 'called', 'back', 'cover', 'where', 'times', 'are', 'listed', 'exercise', 'go', 'work', 'time', 'accordingly', 'had', 'break', 'off', 'middle', 'several', 'routines', 'inaccuracy', 'first', 'thought', 'just', 'got', 'confused', 'realized', 'something', 'was', 'off', 'Also', 'way', 'library', 'DVD', 'done', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'lot', 'poses', 'one', 'side', 'only', 'So', 'follow', 'would', 'have', 'do', 'other', 'side', 'own', 'replay', 'DVD', 'want', 'do', 'sides', 'pose', 'would', 'have', 'pause', 'DVD', 'pose', '20', 'minute', 'routine', 'DVD', 'also', 'longer', 'even', '30', 'minutes', 'when', 'stopped', 'bargain', 'felt', 'set', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'organized', 'better', 'instruction', 'Tara', 'typical', 'style', 'will', 'talk', 'continuously', 'fast', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'taste']",Tara Stiles This is Yoga Set : Complete Yoga Encyclopedia: Daily Yoga + Beginners Yoga + AM/PM Yoga + Complete Yoga Library for Everyone

Her Yoga style and instructions are fabulous.  She obviously knows YOGA and effortlessly demonstrates every move.  If you don't understand a move, just stop for a minute and watch (that's what the rewind button is for).  After doing the routine a few times, you'll get the hang of it and will need to stop and look less and less.  I especially love the AM and PM Yoga flows.  I often come home from work and just need to unwind.  Her PM Yoga routine helps me do just that.  There are two or three different Yoga flows on each DVD (each lasting around 45 minutes) so you have plenty of variety to choose from.  She demonstrates serious Yoga with a relaxed attitude that encourages you not to take yourself too seriously.  Great for all Yoga levels.

1586557,A1UJSOZN1ERD2A,B0096WOKWM,Grace G.,"[72, 74]","Love this. Tara is one of my favorite instructors for her tireless effort to remind you to breathe. These disks are soothing, beautiful, relaxing, and fun. There is definitely a flow for everyone in these disks. Great variety for beginners up past intermediate and even on to advanced who still like a guided practice that is a nice self-challenging no-brainer.Tara's narrative is like a constant path guiding you through every moment with your body in each pose, suggesting play and even micromovements within the greater poses of the flow. I love it! Flow yoga constantly moves, so it can be hard to get clear guidance in new practices unless you choreograph it yourself.Can't say enough good things about this set. Really. It's exactly what I've been looking for in a DVD set for years. Hours of good feelings for body and mind! Varieties of length practices from a 5 minute routines in bed for am and pm, 15 minute Gentle Flow on Disk 2 to an hour long flows on Disks 1 & 3, and plenty of 30-40 minute flows too.Thanks Tara and Strala Yoga for being inspiring, warm, friendly, and approachable. Your love of yoga shines through everything you do, and is contagious. Thank you for being the breadcrumbs we need from where we are in our yoga practice to where we know we want to end up.People seem confused about routine time lengths. Disk two's descriptions have a few names for each flow, so I can see where the confusion is from. The descriptions and times are listed on the back of each disk, but here's a quick guide:Disk 1- Strong Flow (1 hour play time) listed at 60 minutes- Relax Flow (34 minute play time) listed at 30 minutesDisk 2- AM Flow (33 minute play time) listed as Beginners Flowon back of case at 30 minutes- Gentle Flow (14 minute play time) listed on back of caseas Relaxed Easygoing Flow on back of disk at 15 minutes- PM Flow (48 minute play time) listed on back of caseas Calming Night Time Flow at 50 minutesDisk 3- AM Yoga In Bed (4 minute play time) listed at 5 minutes- Daily Flow (32 minute play time) listed on back of caseas Daily Basic Flow at 15 minutes- Energy Flow (1 hour 2 minute play time) listed on caseas Energizing Strong Flow 60 minutes- PM Yoga in Bed (6 minute play time) listed on case asBed Time Flow at 5 minutesDisk 4- Pose LibrarySets of poses related to topics such as Seated, Standing,Sun Salutations, Arm Balance, Inversions, Back Bends,Reclining and runs 90 minutes total according toback of case- BONUS: Strength and Flexibility poses listed as 20collective minutes on back of caseHope that helps! :) I'm printing it up and putting it with the disks for quick reference for myself too since I don't have them memorized yet.",5,"Great yoga practices, great price!",1353542400,"11 22, 2012",2012,2680,"['Love', 'Tara', 'one', 'favorite', 'instructors', 'tireless', 'effort', 'remind', 'breathe', 'disks', 'are', 'soothing', 'beautiful', 'relaxing', 'fun', 'definitely', 'flow', 'everyone', 'disks', 'Great', 'variety', 'beginners', 'past', 'intermediate', 'even', 'advanced', 'who', 'still', 'guided', 'practice', 'nice', 'self-challenging', 'no-brainer.Tara', 'narrative', 'constant', 'path', 'guiding', 'moment', 'body', 'pose', 'suggesting', 'play', 'even', 'micromovements', 'greater', 'poses', 'flow', 'love', 'Flow', 'yoga', 'constantly', 'moves', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'get', 'clear', 'guidance', 'new', 'practices', 'choreograph', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'set', 'Really', 'exactly', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'DVD', 'set', 'years', 'Hours', 'good', 'feelings', 'body', 'mind', 'Varieties', 'length', 'practices', '5', 'minute', 'routines', 'bed', 'am', 'pm', '15', 'minute', 'Gentle', 'Flow', 'Disk', '2', 'hour', 'long', 'Disks', '1', '3', 'plenty', '30-40', 'minute', 'too.Thanks', 'Tara', 'Strala', 'Yoga', 'being', 'inspiring', 'warm', 'friendly', 'approachable', 'love', 'yoga', 'shines', 'everything', 'do', 'contagious', 'Thank', 'being', 'breadcrumbs', 'need', 'where', 'are', 'yoga', 'practice', 'where', 'know', 'want', 'end', 'up.People', 'seem', 'confused', 'routine', 'time', 'lengths', 'Disk', 'two', 'descriptions', 'have', 'few', 'names', 'flow', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'confusion', 'descriptions', 'times', 'are', 'listed', 'back', 'disk', 'here', 'quick', 'guide', 'Disk', '1-', 'Strong', 'Flow', '1', 'hour', 'play', 'time', 'listed', '60', 'minutes-', 'Relax', 'Flow', '34', 'minute', 'play', 'time', 'listed', '30', 'minutesDisk', '2-', 'AM', 'Flow', '33', 'minute', 'play', 'time', 'listed', 'Beginners', 'Flowon', 'back', 'case', '30', 'minutes-', 'Gentle', 'Flow', '14', 'minute', 'play', 'time', 'listed', 'back', 'caseas', 'Relaxed', 'Easygoing', 'Flow', 'back', 'disk', '15', 'minutes-', 'PM', 'Flow', '48', 'minute', 'play', 'time', 'listed', 'back', 'caseas', 'Calming', 'Night', 'Time', 'Flow', '50', 'minutesDisk', '3-', 'AM', 'Yoga', 'Bed', '4', 'minute', 'play', 'time', 'listed', '5', 'minutes-', 'Daily', 'Flow', '32', 'minute', 'play', 'time', 'listed', 'back', 'caseas', 'Daily', 'Basic', 'Flow', '15', 'minutes-', 'Energy', 'Flow', '1', 'hour', '2', 'minute', 'play', 'time', 'listed', 'caseas', 'Energizing', 'Strong', 'Flow', '60', 'minutes-', 'PM', 'Yoga', 'Bed', '6', 'minute', 'play', 'time', 'listed', 'case', 'asBed', 'Time', 'Flow', '5', 'minutesDisk', '4-', 'Pose', 'LibrarySets', 'poses', 'related', 'topics', 'such', 'Seated', 'Standing', 'Sun', 'Salutations', 'Arm', 'Balance', 'Inversions', 'Back', 'Bends', 'Reclining', '90', 'minutes', 'total', 'according', 'toback', 'case-', 'BONUS', 'Strength', 'Flexibility', 'poses', 'listed', '20collective', 'minutes', 'back', 'caseHope', ""'m"", 'printing', 'up', 'putting', 'disks', 'quick', 'reference', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'memorized', 'yet']",Tara Stiles This is Yoga Set : Complete Yoga Encyclopedia: Daily Yoga + Beginners Yoga + AM/PM Yoga + Complete Yoga Library for Everyone
