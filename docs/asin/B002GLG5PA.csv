One day she has a mysterious near drowning that has her dreaming of two days before her first boyfriend Paul dies,and is now at the cross roads wandering weather to trust fate and save him or continue on this path with David her new one. I rated this an A grade plus for been very different and with so many things going on that you can hardly stay up with them. Story line is fabulous and the cast are brilliant, a thriller that will hold your attention to the very end. I hope you have the popcorn ready with your feet up and relaxing in your favourite chair for a marvellous night in with a great old classic for sheer entertainment.

It was kind of a cross between ""The Lake House"" and ""Premonition.""  It even had Julian McMahon in it - for that alone I would watch it.  It's an enjoyable story - a little slow-paced at times, with shots of the countryside and sunshine on the river, but worth watching.",4,Not bad,1263254400,"01 12, 2010",2010,384,"['liked', 'plot', 'description', 'like', 'time', 'travel', 'people-out-of-place', 'stories', 'thought', 'would', 'try', 'was', 'kind', 'cross', 'Lake', 'House', 'Premonition', 'even', 'had', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'alone', 'would', 'watch', 'enjoyable', 'story', 'little', 'slow-paced', 'times', 'shots', 'countryside', 'sunshine', 'river', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
