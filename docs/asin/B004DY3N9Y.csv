This is a notable exception--Black Death is a dark and fairly unique take on the medieval/plague-era genre, with a few earnest subplots and one of the best epilogues I've seen in a long, long time.  The film was shot with a very Hollywood feel, and Bean and Eddie Redmayne are a stellar duo--both have A-list acting chops, and I hope the latter's career continues to take off.  The Black Death might not have been on many folks' radars, but it's a good watch (particularly in October).  I suppose I need to take a second glance at Sean Bean's filmography and see what other gems lie therein.

And while the story feels authentic, and unfolds with some unexpected twists, it feels compromised and the ending feels rushed.  Background info on the production indicates that indeed some compromises and last moment changes were made to the story and it feels that way.  This could have been either much more twisted and eerie without any particular moral stance, or much more convincingly played as a clash of two belief systems, but in the end the opportunity was lost to some hamfisted and rather trite choices.Still, a very good looking movie and quite enjoyable to watch, enough so that I initially gave it four stars just because it looks so damned good.

There's no ""Lord of the Rings"" glamour here. There is, however, lots and lots of bloodshed, combat, torture, crucifixions, dismemberments, and all sorts of physical pains. The movie's description suggests that the story takes a supernatural approach to The Plague, but whether this is or isn't the actual case (I won't spoil it for you) the movie is very visceral and real and doesn't pull any punches in its depiction of medieval life. The movie is almost so brutal, however, that it's hard to develop any interest in what's happening. I didn't feel myself caring for the characters at all, but whether that was my fault or the fault of the shallow character development, I can't be sure.Across the board, the performances of the actors are all quite good. Sean Bean, of Lord of the Rings fame, always looks good in medieval get-up, but his character is pretty one dimensional and may even come across to some as cruel, unless you take the time to appreciate his motives.In the end, the movie is just so depressing that there's really no reason to watch it again.

1397545,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B004DY3N9Y,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[2, 4]","It is 1348 and the Black Death is sweeping the English countryside, killing tens of thousands. A young monk, Osmund, has fallen in love with a young girl who has taken refuge in his monastery. His actions lead him to joining a band of the King's men, led by the knight Ulric, on a mission to find a marshland village reputed to be in the grip of witchcraft. Along the way, he hopes to break off and run away with his love. But in the woodlands he finds himself drawn onto a far darker and crueler path.Black Death is a relatively low-budget movie financed and made in Germany, although the film is in English and has a mostly British cast. It stars Sean Bean as Ulric and Eddie Redmayne - the main character in the recent adaptation of Pillars of the Earth - as Osmund, with veteran actors David Warner (too many roles to list) and Tim McInnery (Blackadder) in support, along with rising star Carice van Houten (noted for recent roles in Black Book, Valkyrie and Repo Men). A bunch of solid supporting actors such as Emun Elliott (soon to be seen in Game of Thrones, along with Bean) and John Lynch (Merlin's father in the BBC series of the same name) line out the relatively small cast.Given this is a small-budget movie with Sean Bean wearing armour and swinging a sword, the first impression is of a cheesy action flick. Nothing could be further from the truth. Black Death is a surprisingly bleak and dark movie about faith, power and fundamentalism. Sean Bean's Ulric is a far, far cry from his other heroic roles or his out-and-out villains. Instead he's a God-fearing knight who believes absolutely that the Black Death is God's punishment of humanity for its sins. He's a brave and capable warrior, but also utterly unrelenting and ruthless in his quest, capable of killing anyone who gets in his way. Redmayne's Osmund is idealistic and hopeful, shocked by the viciousness of the world and the perchance for violence demonstrated by his new associates.The film unexpectedly moves into Wicker Man territory when our protagonists reach the supposedly witch-infested town and become engaged in a struggle of faith, reason and power. McInnery is cast against type as the the town headman, with Van Houten as the woman who has brought hope to it. Van Houten is a little too obviously villainous from the off, but her contempt of those who slavishly believe whatever they are told is well-played.The director, Christopher Smith (best-known for Severance), seems to be aware of the potential for sniggering comparisons to Monty Python and the Holy Grail and with Blackadder, so tackles them head-on. McInnery's casting is possibly one allusion to this, whilst the scene with the monks flagellating themselves as they walk along seems to be a very overt reference to the Grail. Beyond these nods, there is little humour in the film, especially once it moves into its final, dark act.The film's biggest weakness is that the supposedly wordly wise knights fall a little to easily into a certain and very obvious trap, and whilst the film's focus is commendable in an age of bloated 3D monsters, some side-elements and secondary characters could have done with a bit more fleshing out.The film's ending is a startling, expectation-destroying sequence. Initially it appears to render the entire film pointless, but on further reflection it raises further questions over corruption and fundamentalism that are surprisingly effective.Black Death (****) is a dark, bleak and occasionally powerful movie which poses hard questions of its audience. A sometimes uncomfortable watch, this is a far more intelligent and interesting movie than it looks like on first glance. It is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and, on Region 2 import only, USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).",4,Unexpectedly intelligent and thought-provoking,1299369600,"03 6, 2011",2011,3757,"['1348', 'Black', 'Death', 'sweeping', 'English', 'countryside', 'killing', 'tens', 'thousands', 'young', 'monk', 'Osmund', 'fallen', 'love', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'taken', 'refuge', 'monastery', 'actions', 'lead', 'joining', 'band', 'King', 'men', 'led', 'knight', 'Ulric', 'mission', 'find', 'marshland', 'village', 'reputed', 'be', 'grip', 'witchcraft', 'way', 'break', 'off', 'run', 'away', 'love', 'woodlands', 'drawn', 'far', 'darker', 'crueler', 'path.Black', 'Death', 'relatively', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'financed', 'made', 'Germany', 'film', 'English', 'mostly', 'British', 'cast', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Ulric', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'main', 'character', 'recent', 'adaptation', 'Pillars', 'Earth', 'Osmund', 'veteran', 'actors', 'David', 'Warner', 'too', 'many', 'roles', 'list', 'Tim', 'McInnery', 'Blackadder', 'support', 'rising', 'star', 'Carice', 'van', 'Houten', 'noted', 'recent', 'roles', 'Black', 'Book', 'Valkyrie', 'Repo', 'Men', 'bunch', 'solid', 'supporting', 'actors', 'such', 'Emun', 'Elliott', 'soon', 'be', 'seen', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'Bean', 'John', 'Lynch', 'Merlin', 'father', 'BBC', 'series', 'same', 'name', 'line', 'relatively', 'small', 'cast.Given', 'small-budget', 'movie', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'wearing', 'armour', 'swinging', 'sword', 'first', 'impression', 'cheesy', 'action', 'flick', 'Nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'Black', 'Death', 'surprisingly', 'bleak', 'dark', 'movie', 'faith', 'power', 'fundamentalism', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Ulric', 'far', 'far', 'cry', 'other', 'heroic', 'roles', 'out-and-out', 'villains', 'Instead', 'God-fearing', 'knight', 'who', 'absolutely', 'Black', 'Death', 'God', 'punishment', 'humanity', 'sins', 'brave', 'capable', 'warrior', 'also', 'utterly', 'unrelenting', 'ruthless', 'quest', 'capable', 'killing', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', 'Redmayne', 'Osmund', 'idealistic', 'hopeful', 'shocked', 'viciousness', 'world', 'perchance', 'violence', 'demonstrated', 'new', 'associates.The', 'film', 'unexpectedly', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'territory', 'when', 'protagonists', 'reach', 'supposedly', 'witch-infested', 'town', 'become', 'engaged', 'struggle', 'faith', 'reason', 'power', 'McInnery', 'cast', 'type', 'town', 'headman', 'Van', 'Houten', 'woman', 'who', 'brought', 'hope', 'Van', 'Houten', 'little', 'too', 'obviously', 'villainous', 'off', 'contempt', 'who', 'slavishly', 'believe', 'are', 'told', 'well-played.The', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Smith', 'best-known', 'Severance', 'be', 'aware', 'potential', 'sniggering', 'comparisons', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'Blackadder', 'tackles', 'head-on', 'McInnery', 'casting', 'possibly', 'one', 'allusion', 'scene', 'monks', 'flagellating', 'walk', 'along', 'be', 'very', 'overt', 'reference', 'Grail', 'nods', 'little', 'humour', 'film', 'especially', 'final', 'dark', 'act.The', 'film', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'supposedly', 'wordly', 'wise', 'knights', 'fall', 'little', 'easily', 'certain', 'very', 'obvious', 'trap', 'whilst', 'film', 'focus', 'commendable', 'age', 'bloated', '3D', 'monsters', 'side-elements', 'secondary', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'bit', 'more', 'fleshing', 'out.The', 'film', 'ending', 'startling', 'expectation-destroying', 'sequence', 'Initially', 'render', 'entire', 'film', 'pointless', 'further', 'reflection', 'further', 'questions', 'corruption', 'fundamentalism', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'effective.Black', 'Death', '****', 'dark', 'bleak', 'occasionally', 'powerful', 'movie', 'hard', 'questions', 'audience', 'sometimes', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'far', 'more', 'intelligent', 'interesting', 'movie', 'first', 'glance', 'available', 'now', 'UK', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'Region', '2', 'import', 'only', 'USA', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray']","Black Death (2010)  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom ]"

The armor looks worn and uncomfortable, like it doesn't entirely fit (as I imagine it wouldn't unless you were rich), and the weapons seem similarly suited to professional warriors who aren't noblemen.

The plot is simple enough.  The problem is, there is no protagonist to root for and no ""villian.""  Everyone is equally deranged by their religous beliefs, even the pagans, and the movie is one scene of pointless gory battle, gory torturing, death, and suffering after another.I guess if you want to see and hear graphic depictions of beheadings, cruxification, drawing and quartering, hacking of limbs, etc., then this may be for you.  Not that I have a problem with such depictions in movies, but they serve no purpose here other than to shock.By the end of the movie, you don't care who lives or dies, and the movie ends on a sour note by turning the main character into a vengeful blood fiend.

1397552,AB34G6VKP28L,B004DY3N9Y,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[2, 5]","The Black Plague is sweeping across Europe. No one knows where it comes from or how it spreads, only that it leaves rampant death and destruction in its wake. Fearing for her life and hoping to escape ""God's wrath,"" beautiful Averill (Kimberley Nixon) chooses to leave a town that has only recently fallen prey to the illness. The man she loves, a novice at the local monastery, refuses to go with her but she tells him she will wait for him for five days at their former meeting place in case he changes his mind. Young Osmund (Eddie Redmayne) is torn between his love for her and his devotion to Christ, and sees an opportunity to reconsider when a group of men arrive at the monastery on a mission from the bishop. Rumor has it a village in the wilds has not yet been touched by illness and is guarded over by a necromancer.Ulric (Sean Bean) has been dispatched to find the witch or warlock and execute them. But in the woodland between the city and the village lie many perils and at the far end, rampant paganism and other evils await them. The script is surprisingly solid for a B-movie and certainly has enough creepiness and horror to make this an unusual period drama. It has a great cast and decent costuming and design, but it's also unpleasant at times to watch -- not merely for its cruelties but also its rather harsh view of Christianity. Neither Christians nor atheists nor pagans are cast in a very good light, because it all boils down to an entwined series of events built around revenge. Osmund seems the most faithful but in a twist is revealed to have forsaken his compassion for pursuing the slaughter of innocents in God's name. Without revealing too much, in the village they encounter a woman professing to be (or faking it) a necromancer and the villiagers offer them life if they renounce their faith in God. (Of course, they don't intend to keep their promise.) The villiagers believe that killing Christians will keep them safe from the plague.Numerous times, the plague is referenced as God's judgment on all people. Ulric takes his role seriously as a man who kills in the Church's name, and they tote along a torture machine. Supernatural elements are present -- Osmund is haunted by visions of someone he loved haunting him, drenched in blood and full of accusations; it appears that a woman has been resurrected from the dead (later, it is said it was a trick, but the audience is never quite sure). The R-rating is well deserved for moments of explicit violence and intense thematic elements. The scenes in which the men are killed one by one and asked to renounce God are hard to watch. And the script is quite clever in constantly keeping us guessing as we try and figure out who the bad guys are here -- is it Ulric? the witch? the villiagers? Osmund? The ambiguous nature of the story leaves it open to interpretation but at the end of the day it's the lack of inclusion of any sort of moral governing force that leaves a bitter taste. It's a very dark, rather sick, and depressing look into an interesting and horrible time in European history.",2,Utterly Grotesque,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,3085,"['Black', 'Plague', 'sweeping', 'Europe', 'one', 'where', 'how', 'only', 'rampant', 'death', 'destruction', 'wake', 'Fearing', 'life', 'hoping', 'escape', 'God', 'wrath', 'beautiful', 'Averill', 'Kimberley', 'Nixon', 'leave', 'town', 'only', 'recently', 'fallen', 'prey', 'illness', 'man', 'novice', 'local', 'monastery', 'go', 'will', 'wait', 'five', 'days', 'former', 'meeting', 'place', 'case', 'mind', 'Young', 'Osmund', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'torn', 'love', 'devotion', 'Christ', 'opportunity', 'reconsider', 'when', 'group', 'men', 'arrive', 'monastery', 'mission', 'bishop', 'Rumor', 'village', 'wilds', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'touched', 'illness', 'guarded', 'necromancer.Ulric', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'been', 'dispatched', 'find', 'witch', 'warlock', 'execute', 'woodland', 'city', 'village', 'lie', 'many', 'perils', 'far', 'end', 'rampant', 'paganism', 'other', 'evils', 'await', 'script', 'surprisingly', 'solid', 'B-movie', 'certainly', 'enough', 'creepiness', 'horror', 'make', 'unusual', 'period', 'drama', 'great', 'cast', 'decent', 'costuming', 'design', 'also', 'unpleasant', 'times', 'watch', 'not', 'merely', 'cruelties', 'also', 'rather', 'harsh', 'view', 'Christianity', 'Christians', 'atheists', 'pagans', 'are', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'light', 'down', 'entwined', 'series', 'events', 'built', 'revenge', 'most', 'faithful', 'twist', 'revealed', 'have', 'forsaken', 'compassion', 'pursuing', 'slaughter', 'innocents', 'God', 'name', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'village', 'encounter', 'woman', 'professing', 'be', 'faking', 'necromancer', 'villiagers', 'offer', 'life', 'renounce', 'faith', 'God', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'intend', 'keep', 'promise', 'villiagers', 'believe', 'killing', 'Christians', 'will', 'keep', 'safe', 'plague.Numerous', 'times', 'plague', 'referenced', 'God', 'judgment', 'people', 'Ulric', 'role', 'seriously', 'man', 'who', 'Church', 'name', 'tote', 'torture', 'machine', 'Supernatural', 'elements', 'are', 'present', 'Osmund', 'haunted', 'visions', 'someone', 'loved', 'haunting', 'drenched', 'blood', 'full', 'accusations', 'woman', 'been', 'resurrected', 'dead', 'later', 'said', 'was', 'trick', 'audience', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'R-rating', 'well', 'deserved', 'moments', 'explicit', 'violence', 'intense', 'thematic', 'elements', 'scenes', 'men', 'are', 'killed', 'one', 'one', 'asked', 'renounce', 'God', 'are', 'hard', 'watch', 'script', 'quite', 'clever', 'constantly', 'keeping', 'guessing', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'here', 'Ulric', 'witch', 'villiagers', 'ambiguous', 'nature', 'story', 'open', 'interpretation', 'end', 'day', 'lack', 'inclusion', 'sort', 'moral', 'governing', 'force', 'bitter', 'taste', 'very', 'dark', 'rather', 'sick', 'depressing', 'look', 'interesting', 'horrible', 'time', 'European', 'history']","Black Death (2010)  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom ]"

1397555,A1A41SF64JQ02Y,B004DY3N9Y,"C. Repicky ""Marshal of the Temple""","[1, 1]","I purchased this at a Wal-Mart on a whim after seeing the cover.It was an interesting film. I thought it was trying to deliver a message that religions were like plagues, and best to be avoided by isolation. There was a strong anti Catholic feeling in it, much like Ridley Scott&#8217;s film. The attempt to display how pain or the threat of can change anyone&#8217;s belief was interesting, but wouldn&#8217;t support the Warrior Monks&#8217; sacrifice at Hattin in 1187.The story takes place after the demise of the Templar Order, and the lead character sports items hinting he&#8217;s a member of a powerful Order (Hospitaller) as attested by the difference of the Abby to his presence.During this time, under Pope Gregory XI, Hospitallers and Dominicans were used to promote the inquisitorial pursuit of heretics in Europe. (see: The Papacy and the Levant, 1204-1571: The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries By Kenneth Meyer Setton, or Gregory XI bio)So maybe he was&#8230;..all I know is, if my horse were stolen, there&#8217;d be a lot of local villages pretending to be large piles of kindling!The young monk follows the reverse route of experience than Brother Cadfael. It was asking too much of him to make those vows, and the &#8220;enemy&#8221; plays on that fact. On the other hand you have Brother Ulrich&#8217;s character; hardened by life&#8217;s events, and he chooses a path much like some of the historical Warrior Monks did. (Loss of family, a chance to exercise your skills/trade in the pursuit of an idea larger than one&#8217;s self)Some of the events led me to say that if you make an example in a harsh way with someone, you quiet possibly harden the resolve of those you&#8217;re trying to &#8220;win&#8221; over. (See the Knights in the cage, or the young monk, who ended up displaying just this line of thinking)It was a &#8220;No Brainer&#8221; that they&#8217;d kill any knight who turned faiths, because to set him free, was to risk retaliation when he returned with a larger army. It was also to prove to the young monk, that even the strongest would break, to save their skins, and that faith had no deep found roots.Seeing the young monk give up the cloth, so to speak, and live a life of violence is not exactly the same as what Ulrich did. Ulrich was a trained soldier from the beginning, plying his skills in the cause of the faith. The monk/turned warrior, learned violence to exact revenge for what occurred years before. Although in pursuit of the aims of the Church, his was motivated by revenge, and not piety.All in all I liked the movie.",5,Deep theological thinker wrapped in medieval darkness.,1386028800,"12 3, 2013",2013,2580,"['purchased', 'Wal-Mart', 'whim', 'seeing', 'cover.It', 'was', 'interesting', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'trying', 'deliver', 'message', 'religions', 'were', 'plagues', 'best', 'be', 'avoided', 'isolation', 'was', 'strong', 'anti', 'Catholic', 'feeling', 'much', 'Ridley', 'Scott', '8217', 's', 'film', 'attempt', 'display', 'how', 'pain', 'threat', 'can', 'change', 'anyone', '8217', 's', 'belief', 'was', 'interesting', 'wouldn', '8217', 'support', 'Warrior', 'Monks', '8217', 'sacrifice', 'Hattin', '1187.The', 'story', 'place', 'demise', 'Templar', 'Order', 'lead', 'character', 'sports', 'items', 'hinting', '8217', 's', 'member', 'powerful', 'Order', 'Hospitaller', 'attested', 'difference', 'Abby', 'presence.During', 'time', 'Pope', 'Gregory', 'XI', 'Hospitallers', 'Dominicans', 'were', 'used', 'promote', 'inquisitorial', 'pursuit', 'heretics', 'Europe', 'see', 'Papacy', 'Levant', '1204-1571', 'thirteenth', 'fourteenth', 'centuries', 'Kenneth', 'Meyer', 'Setton', 'Gregory', 'XI', 'bio', 'So', 'maybe', 'was', '8230', 'know', 'horse', 'were', 'stolen', '8217', 'd', 'be', 'lot', 'local', 'villages', 'pretending', 'be', 'large', 'piles', 'kindling', 'young', 'monk', 'reverse', 'route', 'experience', 'Brother', 'Cadfael', 'was', 'asking', 'too', 'much', 'make', 'vows', '8220', '8221', 'plays', 'fact', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'Brother', 'Ulrich', '8217', 's', 'character', 'hardened', 'life', '8217', 's', 'events', 'path', 'much', 'historical', 'Warrior', 'Monks', 'did', 'Loss', 'family', 'chance', 'exercise', 'skills/trade', 'pursuit', 'idea', 'larger', 'one', '8217', 's', 'self', 'events', 'led', 'say', 'make', 'example', 'harsh', 'way', 'someone', 'quiet', 'possibly', 'harden', 'resolve', '8217', 're', 'trying', '8220', 'win', '8221', 'See', 'Knights', 'cage', 'young', 'monk', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'displaying', 'just', 'line', 'thinking', 'was', '8220', 'No', 'Brainer', '8221', '8217', 'd', 'kill', 'knight', 'who', 'turned', 'faiths', 'set', 'free', 'was', 'risk', 'retaliation', 'when', 'returned', 'larger', 'army', 'was', 'also', 'prove', 'young', 'monk', 'even', 'strongest', 'would', 'break', 'save', 'skins', 'faith', 'had', 'deep', 'found', 'roots.Seeing', 'young', 'monk', 'give', 'up', 'cloth', 'so', 'speak', 'live', 'life', 'violence', 'not', 'exactly', 'same', 'what', 'Ulrich', 'did', 'Ulrich', 'was', 'trained', 'soldier', 'beginning', 'plying', 'skills', 'cause', 'faith', 'monk/turned', 'warrior', 'learned', 'violence', 'exact', 'revenge', 'what', 'occurred', 'years', 'before', 'pursuit', 'aims', 'Church', 'was', 'motivated', 'revenge', 'not', 'piety.All', 'liked', 'movie']","Black Death (2010)  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom ]"

Soon after, a band of soldiers arrive.  They need a guide to find a remote village supposedly free of the plague; Osmund agrees to guide them, not knowing that the soldiers' true quest is to capture an evil necromancer.BLACK DEATH is a refreshingly uninhibited little horror film.  It's ambiguous enough to please both genre lovers and those like myself who are a little more skeptical (I prefer some brains behind my horror, thank you very much).  Yes, it's a bit predictable, but that's to be expected.  Director Christopher Smith knows his way around a period piece, shooting from Dario Poloni's delightfully minimalist script; Smith lets the horror of the moment sink in, never lingering too long, never showing too much, never letting a dramatic swell of music cue the viewer that yes, something awful is happening.  He also managed to wrangle a fine cast: as young Osmund, Eddie Redmayne gives a truly credible performance.  Sean Bean lends some brawn (and, later, some good dramatic chops) as the soldiers' leader, with Jon Lynch providing a fantastic performance as the moral soldier Wolfstan.  (It's also nice to see David Warner in a small supporting role; he doesn't get enough work these days.)  All of this adds up to a film that doesn't bring anything new to the genre, but is still a welcome film.  It's small and unambitious, and as such, it manages to offer up a few thrills that horror films rarely have these days.  I won't say that BLACK DEATH will scare your socks off; but it will unease you, and if nothing else, it's proof that horror doesn't have to sink to low levels to be entertaining.",4,A surprisingly good little period horror piece.,1329955200,"02 23, 2012",2012,1750,"['Year', 'Lord', '1348', 'Black', 'Death', 'Europe', 'monastery', 'novice', 'monk', 'Osmund', 'separated', 'love', 'faith', 'Soon', 'band', 'soldiers', 'arrive', 'need', 'guide', 'find', 'remote', 'village', 'supposedly', 'free', 'plague', 'Osmund', 'guide', 'not', 'knowing', 'soldiers', 'true', 'quest', 'capture', 'evil', 'necromancer.BLACK', 'DEATH', 'refreshingly', 'uninhibited', 'little', 'horror', 'film', 'ambiguous', 'enough', 'please', 'genre', 'lovers', 'like', 'myself', 'who', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'skeptical', 'prefer', 'brains', 'horror', 'thank', 'very', 'much', 'Yes', 'bit', 'predictable', 'be', 'expected', 'Director', 'Christopher', 'Smith', 'way', 'period', 'piece', 'shooting', 'Dario', 'Poloni', 'delightfully', 'minimalist', 'script', 'Smith', 'horror', 'moment', 'sink', 'never', 'lingering', 'too', 'long', 'never', 'showing', 'too', 'much', 'never', 'letting', 'dramatic', 'swell', 'music', 'cue', 'viewer', 'yes', 'something', 'awful', 'happening', 'also', 'managed', 'wrangle', 'fine', 'cast', 'young', 'Osmund', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'truly', 'credible', 'performance', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'brawn', 'later', 'good', 'dramatic', 'chops', 'soldiers', 'leader', 'Jon', 'Lynch', 'providing', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'moral', 'soldier', 'Wolfstan', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'David', 'Warner', 'small', 'supporting', 'role', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'work', 'days', 'up', 'film', ""n't"", 'bring', 'anything', 'new', 'genre', 'still', 'welcome', 'film', 'small', 'unambitious', 'such', 'offer', 'up', 'few', 'thrills', 'horror', 'films', 'rarely', 'have', 'days', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'BLACK', 'DEATH', 'will', 'scare', 'socks', 'off', 'will', 'unease', 'nothing', 'else', 'proof', 'horror', ""n't"", 'have', 'sink', 'low', 'levels', 'be', 'entertaining']","Black Death (2010)  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom ]"

Insanity need not even play a role, which was the major accomplishment of Black Death. I had a hunch that the woman/witch had drugged the girl, it was kinda logical. And playing with his mind was the key, that was the brilliant part. It is nothing more than charlatans from all ages of old have done. Convince lesser minds of anything using some tried and true old magic tricks. And then of course, a Bishop sending out a small tactical team to find heathens and torture them to death is just part of the fun of ruling idiots.Collectively, it seems that we almost have the exact same thing happening right now, in that, in the far, more comfortable future, they will look on us equally bemused!For several hundred years, the Church massacred, assassinated, tortured and burned anything in its way. The message was clear, confess, live honestly and poorly, respect authority and pay your taxes. Black Death gives us a nugget of that history. Tree people who live in lush mountain lands and have access to medicines and &#34;potions&#34; - fresh water, it makes sense that a group may renounce God and live a Pagan life. Even to this extreme, believing that a woman amongst them can raise the dead.It makes sense that a disease spread mostly by rats would spare these mountain, tree people. Don't forget that cats saved us from it in the end. Save a cat, I say.In the end, this was well done. It takes a slice of our history and serves it up, cold, for our enjoyment.

1397564,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B004DY3N9Y,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","England, 1348: The country is reeling from the plague, but one village surrounded by foggy marshlands remains mysteriously untouched. Some monks at a nearby monastery, along with some knights and soldiers, are convinced that this immunity must be due to the Devil, witches, and necromancers. Led by knight Ulric (Sean Bean), with young monk Osmund (Eddie Redmayne) as a guide, a small band of soldiers journeys to the village to battle Satan.As you can probably surmise from the premise and cover, BLACK DEATH is a very bleak, violent, and gory film. Still, it's nowhere near as schlocky as I thought it might be, and the time setting is captured quite authentically. The makers of this film did an admirable job considering the low budget they were working with. BLACK DEATH's plot follows a solid, original, but fairly predictable path: There aren't a lot of huge surprises, but there are a number of nicely done minor twists. Though it's not exactly Middle English (for which we'd need subtitles), the script is also pretty decent. Careful but spontaneous acting: Carice van Houten is a standout as Langiva, the village enchantress, witch, or whatever one chooses to label her. The fact that she's a real hottie also helps. The pretty natural scenery--set in England but filmed in Germany--provides an effective contrast to all the human horrors here. Finally, BLACK DEATH's religious themes--open to interpretation as pro-Christian, anti-Christian, neither, or both--do a great deal to distinguish it. As I see it, it shows both sides of the religious coin, with just the right amount of vagary.While it didn't absolutely floor me, BLACK DEATH was still a pleasant surprise.NOTE: BLACK DEATH should not be confused withBlack Plague, similarly named, with a similar cover, and also set in England, 1348, but with a completely different (and nowhere near as good) plot.",4,"""We have no pestilence.

1397565,A5QCKO0LL1D5E,B004DY3N9Y,dv_forever,"[4, 5]","This movie really came out of nowhere for me. I heard a little buzz about it but I didn't expect it to be so effective. The medieval era is perhaps my favorite in history, especially the time of The Black Plaque. Why? I guess that misery, terror, death and religious fanaticism appeal to me, bored as I am with capitalism and the modern secular state.So here is another film about this fascinating time period from long ago. The movie starts in very conventional fashion, with flashes of ""Name of the Rose"" and even the abysmal ""Season of the Witch"" with Nicolas Cage. But the cinematography, set design and costumes carry the opening sections even if the plot starts out by the numbers. A group of knights enlist a young monk to guide them to a remote village that is unaffected by the plague.The journey is also predictable with a short battle scene in the forest. It's when the characters finally arrive in the village that this movie takes off into 5th gear. The Christian knights are drugged and tortured by the villagers, who abandoned Christianity for various pagan rituals but are now mainly atheists spearheaded by their godless cult leader. That the leader is a woman makes it even more intense as the battle of wills begin.The knights are men of true conviction, not the wimpy middle class American Christians of today for whom Jesus is a bumper sticker. For these men, God is everything and death is preferable over any earthly secular pleasure. For the viewers who think this is an anti-Christian film, that is not so. This movie appeals to whatever perspective you may hold. If you're godless, you can interpret this movie as an example of religious fanaticism run amok and the violence it can lead to. If you're a Christian, you can interpret this film as one that teaches people to truly stand for God and their faith, even in the face of death. I thought it was a powerful film, whether viewed from one perspective or another.The militant atheists, especially those who despise Christianity, are going to have a blast watching this movie for the torture and killing of Christians. But the Christians win in the end and are portrayed in a positive, heroic light. You can't help but feel for these knights and this young monk as they confront the godless heathens. This is a film with a message but the filmmakers don't really take sides and let the audience's own prejudices guide the interpretation of the film. Sean Bean gives another classy performance. Eddie Redmayne has been doing a lot of medieval stuff lately and he's very good as the young monk. Carice van Houten plays the leader of the villagers with enough venom that one just wants to cut her to pieces. The supporting cast is also outstanding, with every knight given a strong personality.Alright, so ""Black Death"" is not a great film by any measure but it is really well made and isn't just some exploitative trash like ""Season of the Witch"" and other nonsense that is floating around.

The main actors --  Sean Bean, Eddie Redmayne, and Christopher Smith ARE SUPERB!!The movie's plot centers around The Plague, which swept through Europe during the 1300s, killing almost half (if not more)of Europe's population.  However, there is a village that is not ""touched by the plague,"" according to the Bishop, and he says that this village must be populated with ""necromancers,--  those who ""bring the dead back to life.""  Thus, he sends his most courageous Knight (Sean Bean) and a band of fearless soldiers, to find these ""necromancers,"" and bring them to justice (kill them).So, begins the story and adventures of this this fearless knight and his brave soldiers and their plight to find this village in the marshland where the plague has not reached.  Enroute to this village, they visit a monastery to enlist the help of a monk who knows the marshland area where this village sets.  A young monk volunteers, for he is in love with a girl that he wishes to meet on the edge of a forest, near where this village lies.  This young monk views his role as ""guide"" as an opportunity to meet and be with the girl of his dreams.  Little does he know of the danger and betrayal that will soon set in as he travels with this knight and his soldiers to the village in this marshland.What follows is grim terror.  I won't give the entire plot away, but viewers will be entertained, horrified, spooked and left very sad at the ending.

If plagues didn't get you, religious persecution could.The story involves two men of differing faith.  One man (Sean Bean) has an unwavering belief system in place, plus a keen sense of duty.  The other man, a monk (Eddie Redmayne), has a lesser, flawed faith.  How they deal with that faith and the task at hand is the heart of this movie.  Their job is to travel to a distant town untouched by the plague and discover why it has escaped the curse (God's judgment).  Naturally, they are traveling with specific orders in play and a decidedly preconceived notion as to how this town has escaped death (and how they should deal with that).In those days, things were viewed simply, broken into two camps: good or evil.  Anything that was not Church doctrine was definitely evil.  Gray areas were never taken into account, if you were going to err, err on the side of God.  It wasn't a perfect system but it was all they had to work with at the time.  Atrocities were committed by everyone.I viewed this film as an adventure with religious overtones.  I did not see it as anti-Christian.  I also didn't see it as ""A chilling piece of Gothic Horror,"" as the blurb on the DVD claimed (they also called it ""an occult thriller"").

A young monk on the religious fence agrees to guide some of the Bishop's soldiers to a remote village which has somehow managed to avoid being effected by the plague. His real reason for guiding the soldiers is to visit his girlfriend and see what side of the fence he will come down on. The soldiers are sure of what they will find and have weapons and instruments of torture to make things right. Of course, things go awry and it makes for a great ride.Some great decisions were made in this movie. It has a good look and feel. This might be the only movie I've seen that gave me a genuine sense of what life might have been like back then. The costuming, buildings, ubiquitous death and despair were all present. It was shot well. Sometimes the camera was steady and sometimes it moved and the blend was good. I was drawn into the scenes. The casting was good. The band of soldiers was a group of individuals. They didn't run together. The casting agent made sure they didn't all look alike so you could pick each one out in a given scene, and they were all allotted as much personality as possible given the circumstances.The story worked well too. Certain things happened sooner than I expected so it made me wonder where the proceedings would go from there. The Catholic Church has garnered a bad reputation in regard to that period of history and this movie doesn't shy away from showing them in a less than favorable light. These soldiers of God are on a mission and they are going to do what they are going to do no matter what they find. It's a no win situation for whomever is involved. I did wonder how the story would be resolved and was more than pleased with the ending. All too often films move like a freight train only to slip the tracks in the final scenes. Here I felt things stayed true.This is a good movie that, at 102 minutes, is the right length for the content.

Redwayne playing a flawed novice priest was a very good use of his talents and Bean's leader of the Bishop's investigatory force was apt for him.

1397573,A1YTR8FI6UPMA6,B004DY3N9Y,Get Serious,"[1, 2]","(spoilers) Bubonic Plague, one of the three types of the 'Black Death' devastated Europe in the Fourteenth Century, killing up to 30 million people or about half the population of Europe in those times. The Church politically controlled the entire continent and withdrew support for the population, when they could provide no answers. Spread by the plague bacteria present in the guts of infected fleas which infested the common rat, the population was mystified...microscopic identification not following for close to four hundred years! Every conceivable reason for the disease was defined, from 'bad air' to rotting corpses. This film touches upon an unusual aspect presented by 'The Church'. If a town were NOT infected, then there must be a witch or 'necromancer' (someone who talks to the dead) in residence. Enter the Vatican's mercenary torture force, which scours the countryside looking for witches. The film is filmed  in a 'dark and dirty' format, offering the depressing viewpoint of the time of what it must have been like in these small villages and castles, with thousands of corpses laying everywhere. We have some swordfights and are introduced to a monk, who has his faith tested.The film however centers on a specific village in which a ""witche's"" coven controls the populace in an anti-Christian (pagan) belief system. In the end we are shaken in realizing that the 'witch' was just a very smart woman, who manipulated the population though trickery. After the monk is tricked into killing his own woman, we find he has given up his vows to take up the sword and seek out the 'witch', becoming a  representitive of the Vatican's witch-burning mercenaries; adding to the havoc and death of the times. There is more going on here than just the plague and the overt misery of the time. We see interactions of The Church, the population, blame, scapegoating and paranoia in a free-for-all of a terrified population. It is difficult to put your finger on a definition or purpose in a film like this, as there is so much going on with so many viewpoints.

Could have been tightened up a bit...yet one of my favorite scenes was only available as a Bonus Feature ""deleted scene.""  Some scenes of walking could have been cut to make room for that.  I think the crew was so enamored of the glorious German countryside (yes, it's set in England but was shot in Germany) that they let purely landscapey scenes drag on too much.  Surprisingly bloodless considering what they COULD have done with it.  The few scenes of truly awful violence went by fast and there was no effort to cash in on the current taste for ""torture porn,"" when the setting certainly would have permitted it.I suppose what I liked most about the movie was that it was, ultimately, thought-provoking.  SPOILER ALERT!In the end it turns on the idea that an atheist woman living in a swamp fakes magic in order to keep her people under control and safe from the plague.  Safe no matter what, safe at any cost, including becoming as cruel and bloodthirsty as the Catholics whose barbaric god she rejects.  What was dificult about the movie was the paucity of sympathetic characters.  Pretty much everyone was horrible.

1397578,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004DY3N9Y,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 3]","After watching this film, I feel like I should check my 'pits for pus-filled boils or something. BLACK DEATH may be, to quote director Chris Smith, ""a 'guys on a mission' movie that's set in medieval England"" but there's more to it than that. It's a moody supernatural period film. There's a thought-provoking element at play, and a grittiness and a nasty streak. It challenges your perceptions.As historians know, in 1348 Hell came to Earth in the guise of the Black Plague, a disease so malevolent it killed off 50% of Europe's population. The 14th Century isn't exactly known for its enlightened era (it's known more for the Great Famine of 1315 and the Hundred Years' War), and the sweeping pestilence inspired ignorant superstition and vile persecution. The desperate populace turned to passing judgment on each other, suspecting that demons and witches lurk in their midst.Murmurs abound of a remote village in the marshlands that remain untouched by the sickness, a village that shelters a necromancer. Sir Ulric (Sean Bean), knight envoy to the Bishop, is sanctioned by the Church to bring the necromancer to justice. Joining Sir Ulric and his band of unsavory men is their guide, the conflicted young monk Osmund (Eddie Redmayne). Osmund harbors an ulterior motive. Deep in the marshlands he hopes to meet his childhood sweetheart. But Sir Ulric has lied to him, has informed Osmund's monastery that he and his men are on an errand of mercy. But the Iron Maidenesque device strapped on to Ulric's wagon belies his words.On the surface BLACK DEATH looks to be a bleak medieval horror adventure film, but you need to peek closer. The story places our gents in morally complex scenarios. It raises themes dealing with faith and religious zeal and fundamentalism. The movie's ending leaves you debating whether there really was a supernatural element at work. At the end, you question the characters, you question their worldviews. It doesn't help that Sir Ulric's troop of men is composed of sinister warriors (one of whom is a professional torturer). Sean Bean turns in a strong performance as the righteous Sir Ulric who does occasionally exhibit moments of clemency (or, let's say, relative clemency). Sir Ulric doesn't stray from his devotion to God. You may or may not blame his unshakable faith for what befalls him and his men when they finally arrive at their sought after destination. They take in the friendly, hospitable village and can you blame them for harboring doubts? That is, excepting Sir Ulric. He persists in his claim that dark forces hold sway in the village. Perhaps.Osmund the monk may've been our default point-of-view character, but there's a callowness about him which made me sort of dismiss him. And neither Sir Ulric's stoic nature nor his unrelenting beliefs endear him to this viewer. Me, I found myself sympathizing the most with the world-weary veteran, Wolfstan, who as thoughtfully played by John Lynch proves to be the wisest soldier in Ulric's seedy bunch.I frankly thought this would be scarier. Credit the film for its wealth of macabre imagery and the oppressiveness which blankets each scene. These lend a chilling atmosphere. There are a few sword fights and so credit, too, the realism and brisk brutality that went into the staging of them. Sucks not to have a band-aid or Neosporin in the 14th century. I recommend BLACK DEATH. It's not a by-the-numbers movie. It'll make you think. It'll surprise you. I did not see that unsettling coda coming at all.The DVD's bonus material:- 4 Deleted Scenes (totaling 00:04:21 minutes)- Bringing BLACK DEATH to Life (00:11:33 minutes)- Interviews with the Cast & Crew (totaling 00:32:33 minutes)- Behind the Scenes Footage (00:10:41)- HDNet: A Look at BLACK DEATH (00:03:50)- Theatrical Trailer",4,"""Do not be fooled.

1397579,A2TUCS8O6AJXKJ,B004DY3N9Y,"-- ""--""","[2, 4]","I don't typically review movies, but ""Black Death"" is a surprisingly good Dark Ages mashup of period drama, brooding horror, and even hack and slash action. The mood is pervasively bleak, as one would expect about any movie set in the time of the Black Plague, and therefore fitting. It opens oppressively and ends perhaps even more so, leaving nothing that even resembles a happy Hollywood ending, which will undoubtedly alienate some. So too will the violence, which often happens offscreen (including scenes of torture that could have ended up feeling like a Dark Ages version of ""Saw,"" but thankfully don't), but it is nonetheless raw and brutal. Point of fact, one mid-movie battle is brilliantly staged and shot, making the sword-crossing sequences in other such films, i.e. ""Centurian,"" feel cartoony by comparison. When the mood shifts over to that of a thriller or horror film, the movie doesn't so much as miss a step. The ending, which I'll not dare spoil, is a great turning of the tables, and provides moments of triumph and complete and total failure that seem cynically like one and the same.

1397591,A3UZFB2LEZYWCT,B004DY3N9Y,"JLL ""jamesndir""","[3, 4]","This is an awesome move.  STORY: very original and well done.  A group of warriors is going to a village that has avoided the plaque with the hint of black magic.  They pick up a monk who knows the area and is also in love with a girl from his hometown.  The village is not at all what they think and the mystery around the village and the leader is incredibly well done-don't want to give too much away!  BATTLES:  There are several fight scenes and they are as good as it gets for battles/fight scenes.  Great and brutal action (i.e. some Mike Tyson reconstructive surgery, lots of limbs and heads flying).  GREAT!  There are also some stomach churning torture scenes as well.  CHARACTERS: Most people know Sean Bean from his great performance in Lord of the Rings.  He has another great performance but the rest of cast is awesome as well (especially John Lynch and his character).  They are developed nicely.  SCENERY: This is one of the best parts of the film.  You feel like you are in the 1300's England.  Awesome sets from the monastery, to the village, to the forest to the marsh. CAMERA:  I know a few people complained about camera work, I disagree.  Most of the camera work is done standard and not shaky.  There are some battle scenes and when they are walking in the marsh that the camera men are in the action with them but this is not annoying it is awesome, it really makes you feel like you are in the battle or walking in the marsh-kind of like Saving Private Ryan). DIRECTOR:  OK, other than George Lucas I cannot name another director, until now.  I loved the movie so much I watched the special features which are great.  The director is Christopher Smith and you can tell how much he loves directing and working with actors.  I would really recommend watching the special features.  I will be looking for his movies in the future.  I really hate that this movie didn't make it to US theaters, I just don't understand it.  I would have loved to see it on the big screen.

1397592,A6X6LNZO1C3EZ,B004DY3N9Y,J. Munyon,"[3, 5]","Sean Bean plays the part of Ulric, a mercenary knight on a mission for the Bishop.  There is a village that reportedly has not been affected by the bubonic plague (circa 1348 A.D.), and rumors indicate the reason why is a necromancer (one who brings the dead back to life) or a witch (one who uses herbs and spells) has some kind of unholy alliance with evil.  What follows is a Sci-Fi / Fantasy film of a brief introduction to the seasoned fighters among the rest of the crew of mercenary knights travelling with Ulric, and a young monk who knows the territory so the monk serves as guide.  The knights encounter a band of thieves who wield the weapons of that time period with above average skill, and that fight in the forest is possibly the high point of special FX.  There is a swamp to wade through and the viewer has to use their own imagination considerably during that sequence or end up wondering why that was even left in the movie.  Then there is the village.  From this point, the movie seems to be geared to educated, mature audiences who are strong fans of Sci-Fi / Fantasy, and this is possibly the most milquetoast type film if all you consider is religion.  There is no incredible degree of anti-Christian or anti-Pagan holy crusade anywhere as part of the intended message of this film, as some reviewers have commented.  I've seen stronger sentiment along religious lines on Sesame Street with Jim Henson's muppets.  The point of this film is the emotional awakening of the young monk, who loses his beautiful girlfriend (that he's not supposed to have), sees her seem to be resurrected from the dead, loses her again, and due to the trauma of the surrounding events compounding upon the pain of forbidden love ending badly; the monk now turns to near insanity as he seeks vengeance against women who allegedly practice what that time period considers to be the dark arts.  It isn't so much a religious thing as it is how he watched most of the mercenary knights tortured and killed, and as the young monk's innocence of adolescence was fading away, a forbidden love is overcome with tragedy that few would ever remain unchanged by.  Religion just isn't the focus, and anybody who thinks this is a religious film is grossly in error; the Dark Ages of that time period had very little understanding of any religion beyond the persecution and control of the Catholic Church at almost Spanish Inquisition levels.  However, the movie ""Black Death"" isn't making a statement about anything necessarily having to do with religion, the film delves into the psyche of human nature and how we are all shaped by the events, opportunities, and fortitude that affect our lives directly or indirectly.  As a product of our own experiences and environments, how we handle the years that pass will shape us in a myriad of directions, it simply falls to opportunity and resources after that.  In my mind, the leader of the mercenary knights ends up on the worst end of the mission, if you compare his demise to the village witch; but the movie doesn't let me feel sorry for either one of them.  In my opinion, this movie focusses upon the young monk and how circumstances change him as he matures.Kimberley Nixon plays the part of the forbidden girlfriend, Marianne Graffam plays the part of the witch, and ""Black Death"" also stars Eddie Redmayne, David Warner, Carice Van Houten, Andy Nyman, Tim McInnerny, John Lynch, Emun Elliott, Johnny Harris, Tygo Gernandt, and other people who seem familiar and yet not so familiar.  The R rating for this film is for the violence and gore, but the weapons and fighting is well done, and although tastefully done female nudity would have rounded out the movie quite a bit (WOULD have, but if there was any I missed it), I still give this film a 4 star rating.",4,"a lunch meat sandwich without cheese, and very little sauce.",1305849600,"05 20, 2011",2011,3803,"['Sean', 'Bean', 'part', 'Ulric', 'mercenary', 'knight', 'mission', 'Bishop', 'village', 'reportedly', 'not', 'been', 'affected', 'bubonic', 'plague', 'circa', '1348', 'A.D.', 'rumors', 'indicate', 'reason', 'why', 'necromancer', 'one', 'who', 'dead', 'back', 'life', 'witch', 'one', 'who', 'herbs', 'spells', 'kind', 'unholy', 'alliance', 'evil', 'What', 'Sci-Fi', '/', 'Fantasy', 'film', 'brief', 'introduction', 'seasoned', 'fighters', 'rest', 'crew', 'mercenary', 'knights', 'travelling', 'Ulric', 'young', 'monk', 'who', 'territory', 'monk', 'guide', 'knights', 'encounter', 'band', 'thieves', 'who', 'wield', 'weapons', 'time', 'period', 'above', 'average', 'skill', 'fight', 'forest', 'possibly', 'high', 'point', 'special', 'FX', 'swamp', 'wade', 'viewer', 'use', 'own', 'imagination', 'considerably', 'sequence', 'end', 'up', 'wondering', 'why', 'was', 'even', 'left', 'movie', 'Then', 'village', 'point', 'movie', 'be', 'geared', 'educated', 'mature', 'audiences', 'who', 'are', 'strong', 'fans', 'Sci-Fi', '/', 'Fantasy', 'possibly', 'most', 'milquetoast', 'type', 'film', 'consider', 'religion', 'incredible', 'degree', 'anti-Christian', 'anti-Pagan', 'holy', 'crusade', 'anywhere', 'part', 'intended', 'message', 'film', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'stronger', 'sentiment', 'religious', 'lines', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'muppets', 'point', 'film', 'emotional', 'awakening', 'young', 'monk', 'who', 'beautiful', 'girlfriend', 'not', 'supposed', 'have', 'seem', 'be', 'resurrected', 'dead', 'again', 'due', 'trauma', 'surrounding', 'events', 'compounding', 'pain', 'forbidden', 'love', 'ending', 'badly', 'monk', 'now', 'near', 'insanity', 'vengeance', 'women', 'who', 'allegedly', 'practice', 'what', 'time', 'period', 'considers', 'be', 'dark', 'arts', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'religious', 'thing', 'how', 'watched', 'most', 'mercenary', 'knights', 'tortured', 'killed', 'young', 'monk', 'innocence', 'adolescence', 'was', 'fading', 'away', 'forbidden', 'love', 'overcome', 'tragedy', 'few', 'would', 'ever', 'remain', 'unchanged', 'Religion', 'just', ""n't"", 'focus', 'anybody', 'who', 'religious', 'film', 'grossly', 'error', 'Dark', 'Ages', 'time', 'period', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'understanding', 'religion', 'persecution', 'control', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'almost', 'Spanish', 'Inquisition', 'levels', 'However', 'movie', 'Black', 'Death', ""n't"", 'making', 'statement', 'anything', 'necessarily', 'having', 'do', 'religion', 'film', 'psyche', 'human', 'nature', 'how', 'are', 'shaped', 'events', 'opportunities', 'fortitude', 'affect', 'lives', 'directly', 'indirectly', 'product', 'own', 'experiences', 'environments', 'how', 'handle', 'years', 'pass', 'will', 'shape', 'myriad', 'directions', 'simply', 'opportunity', 'resources', 'mind', 'leader', 'mercenary', 'knights', 'up', 'worst', 'end', 'mission', 'compare', 'demise', 'village', 'witch', 'movie', ""n't"", 'let', 'feel', 'sorry', 'one', 'opinion', 'movie', 'young', 'monk', 'how', 'circumstances', 'change', 'Nixon', 'part', 'forbidden', 'girlfriend', 'Marianne', 'Graffam', 'part', 'witch', 'Black', 'Death', 'also', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'David', 'Warner', 'Carice', 'Van', 'Houten', 'Andy', 'Nyman', 'Tim', 'McInnerny', 'John', 'Lynch', 'Emun', 'Elliott', 'Johnny', 'Harris', 'Tygo', 'Gernandt', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'familiar', 'yet', 'not', 'so', 'familiar', 'R', 'rating', 'film', 'violence', 'gore', 'weapons', 'fighting', 'well', 'done', 'tastefully', 'done', 'female', 'nudity', 'would', 'have', 'rounded', 'out', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit', 'WOULD', 'have', 'was', 'missed', 'still', 'give', 'film', '4', 'star', 'rating']","Black Death (2010)  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom ]"

1397594,AAU5MAMZRRR80,B004DY3N9Y,John Milton,"[2, 2]","I have to start out with a confession: I avoided this movie as if it carried the plague itself. To me, it looked fairly generic and when I had checked it out previously, it was described as a historical adventure mystery horror film. Such a description failed to pique my interest.Convinced by one of my oldest and dearest friends to give the film a chance, I settled down to watch 2010's Black Death, a film directed by Christopher Smith (Creep, Severance) and starring Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings, Silent Hill), Eddie Redmayne (The Other Boleyn Girl, The Good Shepherd) and Carice van Houten (Repo Men, Valkyrie).The DVD cover offered the following synopsis:""The year is 1348. Europe has fallen under the shadow of the Black Death. As the plague decimates all in its path, fear and superstition are rife. There are rumors of a village hidden in marshland that the plague cannot reach. There is talk of a necromancer who leads the village and is able to bring the dead back to life. Ulric (Sean Bean), a fearsome knight, is charged by the church to investigate these rumors. Joined by a young monk and a small consort of soldiers, the journey ahead will lead them into the heart of darkness where faith is challenged and put to the ultimate test.""I have to open with admitting that I was impressed by this film. Within minutes, I was reminded of a number of films such as: The Name of the Rose, Witchfinder General, Roger Corman's The Pit and The Pendulum and The Masque of the Red Death; and much of the movie had the feel of an old school Hammer production. Top marks from me so far...However, proceedings for a significant portion of the movie were very much in the vein of a dark action/adventure. Much is made of the plague sweeping across the country and the viewer is treated to the execution of a ""witch"" and the summary despatching of one of the soldiers sent to investigate the mysterious village. It is only when the band arrive at the village that this film ventures into solid horror country.Speaking of the country, Black Death was filmed in Germany and much of the proceedings took place outdoors, lending a much needed element of reality to a movie that would have suffered greatly had it been filmed on a studio lot.Given that the film is set about 650 years ago, some of the messages conveyed are still as relevant then as they are now, such as what people are prepared to do in the name of religion.I don't want to spoil the film for any potential viewer but this film is worthy of inclusion in the horror genre. There's bloody violence, executions, crucifixions, dismemberment, pagan/ satanic worship and resurrection of the dead. The film has been criticised for its depiction of torture methods but in my opinion, it doesn't exactly venture into torture-porn; but I think it's fair to say that gorehounds will appreciate Black Death!Despite these brutal aspects, the plot of Black Death is far from neglected and is in fact compelling; and the characters are convincingly portrayed by those already mentioned and ably supported by experienced performers such as: Tim McInnerny (Severance, Rogue Trader), John Lynch (Moll Flanders, In the Name of the Father), Johnny Harris (RocknRolla, Dorian Gray); and there's also a nice turn from veteran actor David Warner (Straw Dogs, The Omen, Time Bandits).Christopher Smith has conjured up a suitably dour atmosphere for Black Death; created a cast of characters devoid of any real heroes or ""good guys""; and topped it off with a suitably sombre, bleak and barbaric ending making Black Death a solid entry to the genre but family entertainment it ain't!",5,Dark offerings in Black Death,1355616000,"12 16, 2012",2012,3619,"['have', 'start', 'out', 'confession', 'avoided', 'movie', 'carried', 'plague', 'looked', 'fairly', 'generic', 'when', 'had', 'checked', 'out', 'previously', 'was', 'described', 'historical', 'adventure', 'mystery', 'horror', 'film', 'description', 'failed', 'pique', 'interest.Convinced', 'one', 'oldest', 'dearest', 'friends', 'give', 'film', 'chance', 'settled', 'down', 'watch', '2010', 'Black', 'Death', 'film', 'directed', 'Christopher', 'Smith', 'Creep', 'Severance', 'starring', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'Other', 'Boleyn', 'Girl', 'Good', 'Shepherd', 'Carice', 'van', 'Houten', 'Repo', 'Men', 'Valkyrie', '.The', 'DVD', 'cover', 'offered', 'following', 'synopsis', 'year', '1348', 'Europe', 'fallen', 'shadow', 'Black', 'Death', 'plague', 'path', 'fear', 'superstition', 'are', 'rife', 'are', 'rumors', 'village', 'hidden', 'marshland', 'plague', 'can', 'not', 'reach', 'talk', 'necromancer', 'who', 'village', 'able', 'bring', 'dead', 'back', 'life', 'Ulric', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'fearsome', 'knight', 'charged', 'church', 'investigate', 'rumors', 'Joined', 'young', 'monk', 'small', 'consort', 'soldiers', 'journey', 'ahead', 'will', 'lead', 'heart', 'darkness', 'where', 'faith', 'challenged', 'put', 'ultimate', 'test', 'have', 'open', 'admitting', 'was', 'impressed', 'film', 'minutes', 'was', 'reminded', 'number', 'films', 'such', 'Name', 'Rose', 'Witchfinder', 'General', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'Pit', 'Pendulum', 'Masque', 'Red', 'Death', 'much', 'movie', 'had', 'feel', 'old', 'school', 'Hammer', 'production', 'Top', 'marks', 'so', 'far', 'However', 'proceedings', 'significant', 'portion', 'movie', 'were', 'very', 'much', 'vein', 'dark', 'action/adventure', 'Much', 'made', 'plague', 'sweeping', 'country', 'viewer', 'treated', 'execution', 'witch', 'summary', 'despatching', 'one', 'soldiers', 'sent', 'investigate', 'mysterious', 'village', 'only', 'when', 'band', 'arrive', 'village', 'film', 'ventures', 'solid', 'horror', 'country.Speaking', 'country', 'Black', 'Death', 'was', 'filmed', 'Germany', 'much', 'proceedings', 'took', 'place', 'outdoors', 'lending', 'much', 'needed', 'element', 'reality', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'suffered', 'greatly', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'studio', 'lot.Given', 'film', 'set', '650', 'years', 'ago', 'messages', 'conveyed', 'are', 'still', 'relevant', 'then', 'are', 'now', 'such', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'prepared', 'do', 'name', 'religion.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'film', 'potential', 'viewer', 'film', 'worthy', 'inclusion', 'horror', 'genre', 'bloody', 'violence', 'executions', 'crucifixions', 'dismemberment', 'pagan/', 'satanic', 'worship', 'resurrection', 'dead', 'film', 'been', 'criticised', 'depiction', 'torture', 'methods', 'opinion', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'venture', 'torture-porn', 'think', 'fair', 'say', 'gorehounds', 'will', 'appreciate', 'Black', 'Death', 'brutal', 'aspects', 'plot', 'Black', 'Death', 'far', 'neglected', 'fact', 'compelling', 'characters', 'are', 'convincingly', 'portrayed', 'already', 'mentioned', 'ably', 'supported', 'experienced', 'performers', 'such', 'Tim', 'McInnerny', 'Severance', 'Rogue', 'Trader', 'John', 'Lynch', 'Moll', 'Flanders', 'Name', 'Father', 'Johnny', 'Harris', 'RocknRolla', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'also', 'nice', 'turn', 'veteran', 'actor', 'David', 'Warner', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'Omen', 'Time', 'Bandits', '.Christopher', 'Smith', 'conjured', 'up', 'suitably', 'dour', 'atmosphere', 'Black', 'Death', 'created', 'cast', 'characters', 'devoid', 'real', 'heroes', 'good', 'guys', 'topped', 'off', 'suitably', 'sombre', 'bleak', 'barbaric', 'ending', 'making', 'Black', 'Death', 'solid', 'entry', 'genre', 'family', 'entertainment', 'ai', ""n't""]","Black Death (2010)  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom ]"
1397595,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B004DY3N9Y,John's Horror Corner,"[10, 12]","Sean Bean, still sporting his fresh-of-the-set of HBO's Game of Thrones shag, plays the Bishop's go-to badass (Ulric) in this compelling medieval mystery-action movie.  His team of mercenaries is guided toward a marsh village by a young monk (Osmond) with ulterior motives of forbidden romance.  Their mission is essentially a witch hunt.  This marsh village has been rumored to have been spared by the black death and its people, naturally, must be in league with the devil.  Ulric and his men have been charged to find their God-renouncing heretic leader and bring him back to be tried and executed in the name of God.Ulric is as gritty and callous as they come.  He was ""chosen by God"" for this mission and would sooner gut a wrongly accused innocent than be troubled to detour his mission.  Bean's Ulric is rather extreme, but easily likeable by any typical Maxim subscriber.  However, it is the young monk (played by Eddie Redmayne) who brings the sincerity to the screen.  He anthropomorphizes the compassion, desperation, fear and longing of Everyman while Ulric filters all such characteristics through a prism of fanatical devotion to his charge.  Ulric's mercenaries initially depict greed, yet later favor to their fellow soldiers and demonstrate surprising camaraderie when faced with the worst.  They are dirty, ratty-haired, and perfectly credible ""tough guys"".I was a bit confused by the action scenes in this movie.  They were brutal and cool, but would have been much better without the palsy-shaky camerawork.  Maybe this camera style was meant to help the tone, but then why put so much effort into the gore, choreography and surroundings if the intended filming style only masks the effects of such efforts?  Again, the battle scenes were good.  This was also one of few movies which well-identified how exhausting it is to swing a sword for 60-90 seconds.  Not since The 13th Warrior have I seen that portrayed so accurately.  Ensuing the fray, these guys sounded like a fat kid after running a mile for his high school physical fitness test.Finally Ulric and his men reach the quiet, plague-free, hospitable town.  They are welcomed, wounds are dressed, and they are hosted with dinner and lodging.  Here's where I have to stop giving details.  I'll close by saying that I really like this movie, although there was (what I consider to be) a big oversight in the scenes which transitioned between the middle and end portions of the movie.  I'm not saying that it's obvious or that everyone should catch it, but I felt like it was an insult to my intelligence as a viewer for the screenwriters to assume that viewers wouldn't catch it.  This ranty nit-picking aside, if you liked Sean Bean in ""any"" other movie then I vote you see this one.Fair warning, I feel that they showed more than they should have in the trailer.  Not that it obviously gives anything away, but I suggest that you do NOT watch it.  I didn't see it before watching the movie.

1397596,A1HS4595P8TLG8,B004DY3N9Y,JPS,"[3, 3]","There have been many reviews of this film already, and quite a large number of them have tended to drop heavy hints about the story (not to say spoilers). Accordingly, I will limit myself to a few comments and try to explain why I liked this film so much more than I had expected to.The first point is that my expectations have been rather low, and perhaps too low, just as it seems to have been the case for a number of other reviewers on Amazon sites. It is obviously always somewhat preferable to experience a ""nice"" rather than an ""unpleasant"" surprise, and this tends to influence the rating that a reviewer might deliver. I, like many others, have had a rather ""nice"" surprise when watching this film made on a relatively small budget by a director that I had never heard about before. I would have gone for the film anyway, as I tend to do with all ""historical"" films where the action is supposed to take place either during Antiquity or during the Middle Ages. To tell the truth, I was expecting an action romp with a lot of fighting, possibly quite a bit of gore, a second rate scenario, and a bunch of second rate actors. While this film is not a masterpiece, I nevertheless got something different and much better than what I was expecting.Second, there was a real plot, set in 1348 as the Black Plague (or Black Death, hence the film's title) is sweeping across the British Isles after having ravaged Europe. These rather extraordinary circumstances, and the extremes to which people are lead to as a result, are superbly rendered at the beginning of the film. So you get the mass burials were the victims of the plague can hardly be buried fast enough before yet another load of carts full of bodies comes along. You also get the population of a village turning on however in their community happens to be different from them, whatever may be meant by ""different"", as they blame them for having somehow caused the disease (sorcery and witchcraft being the reason, of course). You also get a whole bunch of half crazed flagellants that come across the expedition of our heroes - a knight working for the Holy Inquisition, his band of professional warriors, and Osmond, a young monk who guides them to their destination: a village surrounded by marshes and inexplicably spared from the plague.Third, the historical context and details seem to be remarkably accurate or, perhaps more modestly, I should just mention that I did not spotted any significant ""howlers"". In addition to the context mentioned above, this includes the two main characters - Ulric (Sean Bean), the leader of the band of soldiers serving the Church and tasked to root out heretics by any means, and Osmond (Eddie Redmayne), the young, totally inexperienced and somewhat nave monk who guides them on their way. These two characters, in particular, had much more depth to them than what I was expecting. Ulric is not only a brute, a soldier and a ruthless killer driven by his faith, and Sean Bean has a bit of a field day in playing the part. Osmond is not only a boy, pure and innocent (he is not entirely innocent, by the way). I also very much liked some of the other characters, in particular the ""unnervingly"" smiling Tim McInnerny.Fourth, there is the gore and fighting. Surprisingly, there is not too much of either. I was expecting more, but it is both credible and sufficient. There is only one significant fight when Ulric's troop is attacked by bandits on its way, but it is a rather spectacular one, with a clear emphasis put on making it as ""realistic"" as possible. I had expected also a big fight towards the end, with our heroes being, of course, finally victorious, but this is NOT how the film ends and, as far as I am concerned, I was surprised by the ending.So, for me at least, this little film turned out to be an unexpected gem. It is not the biggest gem you can think off. It is not the purest or the most precious one, either, but it is a little gem all the same, and enough of one to have watched the film a couple of times over the last few months.",4,"Doom, Gloom and surprisingly good",1340150400,"06 20, 2012",2012,4057,"['have', 'been', 'many', 'reviews', 'film', 'already', 'quite', 'large', 'number', 'have', 'tended', 'drop', 'heavy', 'hints', 'story', 'not', 'say', 'spoilers', 'Accordingly', 'will', 'limit', 'few', 'comments', 'try', 'explain', 'why', 'liked', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'had', 'expected', 'to.The', 'first', 'point', 'expectations', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'low', 'perhaps', 'too', 'low', 'just', 'have', 'been', 'case', 'number', 'other', 'reviewers', 'Amazon', 'sites', 'obviously', 'always', 'somewhat', 'preferable', 'experience', 'nice', 'rather', 'unpleasant', 'surprise', 'influence', 'rating', 'reviewer', 'might', 'deliver', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'had', 'rather', 'nice', 'surprise', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'made', 'relatively', 'small', 'budget', 'director', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'before', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'film', 'anyway', 'tend', 'do', 'historical', 'films', 'where', 'action', 'supposed', 'take', 'place', 'Antiquity', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'tell', 'truth', 'was', 'expecting', 'action', 'romp', 'lot', 'fighting', 'possibly', 'quite', 'bit', 'gore', 'second', 'rate', 'scenario', 'bunch', 'second', 'rate', 'actors', 'film', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'nevertheless', 'got', 'something', 'different', 'much', 'better', 'what', 'was', 'expecting.Second', 'was', 'real', 'plot', 'set', '1348', 'Black', 'Plague', 'Black', 'Death', 'hence', 'film', 'title', 'sweeping', 'British', 'Isles', 'having', 'ravaged', 'Europe', 'rather', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'extremes', 'people', 'are', 'lead', 'result', 'are', 'superbly', 'rendered', 'beginning', 'film', 'get', 'mass', 'burials', 'were', 'victims', 'plague', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'buried', 'fast', 'enough', 'before', 'yet', 'load', 'carts', 'full', 'bodies', 'along', 'also', 'get', 'population', 'village', 'turning', 'however', 'community', 'be', 'different', 'may', 'be', 'meant', 'different', 'blame', 'having', 'somehow', 'caused', 'disease', 'sorcery', 'witchcraft', 'being', 'reason', 'course', 'also', 'get', 'whole', 'bunch', 'half', 'crazed', 'flagellants', 'come', 'expedition', 'heroes', 'knight', 'working', 'Holy', 'Inquisition', 'band', 'professional', 'warriors', 'Osmond', 'young', 'monk', 'who', 'destination', 'village', 'surrounded', 'marshes', 'inexplicably', 'spared', 'plague.Third', 'historical', 'context', 'details', 'seem', 'be', 'remarkably', 'accurate', 'perhaps', 'more', 'modestly', 'should', 'just', 'mention', 'did', 'not', 'spotted', 'significant', 'howlers', 'addition', 'context', 'mentioned', 'above', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Ulric', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'leader', 'band', 'soldiers', 'serving', 'Church', 'tasked', 'root', 'out', 'heretics', 'means', 'Osmond', 'Eddie', 'Redmayne', 'young', 'totally', 'inexperienced', 'somewhat', 'nave', 'monk', 'who', 'guides', 'way', 'two', 'characters', 'particular', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'depth', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'Ulric', 'not', 'only', 'brute', 'soldier', 'ruthless', 'killer', 'driven', 'faith', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'bit', 'field', 'day', 'playing', 'part', 'Osmond', 'not', 'only', 'boy', 'pure', 'innocent', 'not', 'entirely', 'innocent', 'way', 'also', 'very', 'much', 'liked', 'other', 'characters', 'particular', 'unnervingly', 'smiling', 'Tim', 'McInnerny.Fourth', 'gore', 'fighting', 'Surprisingly', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'credible', 'sufficient', 'only', 'one', 'significant', 'fight', 'when', 'Ulric', 'troop', 'attacked', 'bandits', 'way', 'rather', 'spectacular', 'one', 'clear', 'emphasis', 'put', 'making', 'realistic', 'possible', 'had', 'expected', 'also', 'big', 'fight', 'end', 'heroes', 'being', 'course', 'finally', 'victorious', 'NOT', 'how', 'film', 'ends', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'was', 'surprised', 'ending.So', 'least', 'little', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'unexpected', 'gem', 'not', 'biggest', 'gem', 'can', 'think', 'off', 'not', 'purest', 'most', 'precious', 'one', 'little', 'gem', 'same', 'enough', 'one', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'couple', 'times', 'last', 'few', 'months']","Black Death (2010)  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom ]"

Amato ""linda martial arts""","[7, 11]","While this movie had a nice use of color and cinematography, I give it only 4 stars because it comes up alittle short. But as for the bad reviews for being anti-christian, ignore these. It does paint a bad picture of christianity, but only because it is showing the truth about the realities of many religions. Many older movies tried to glorify Jewish and Christian beliefs but that is hollywood. The more you read history books and not religious theologies, the more you see how religion was used to control and stifle people.It is a fact that if you went against the popular belief it led to death. People are just mad at this movie for showing the more realistic side to what it was like to live in those days. It was not soccer moms coming out of their minivans for an hour and jumping back in to go to the mall.Many reviewers feel Christians are portrayed in a bad light. Too bad. It is what it is. History paints more oppression and condemnation about Christians than a pastor painting some glorified picture to get his weekly donations.One big focus of this movie is on how Christians want to put this village to death for not being affected by the plague. Take religion out of the scenario and if this had happened in real life, it would not lead to death, but curiosity as to why these people had survived where others have died. Religion has been proven to slow progress and science in the name God. Nostradomus was threatened for  his views and had to conceal them or be ridiculed. And many times people that did survive an incident or do something unexplained or misunderstood were put to death or punished. Enjoy this movie for what it is. If you are a religious fanatic and get insulted by this type of view, than pass on this movie. People are so fast to throw religious views in other people faces, but as soon as someone takes an alternative point of view they get mad. Grow up. The bible is filled with sooo much violence and dark stories it is awful. Being raised Roman Catholic I found the Bible to be horrific. It is not a feel good book. The historical parts of the bible, not the inspirational parts, are dark and depressing. Just history in general is violent and scary. Back before the Egyptians and foward, every historical account shows war, conquering, death and destruction. It is not just religion. But do not paint religion out to be feel good stuff. Life before the 20th century was hard. We are so spoiled today with our houses and cars and computers. If you had to endure those days, you would have to have tread lightly. So lighten up and learn to look outside faith. It is a movie that portrayed a different, but not untrue point of view. I do not like people that bring religion into reviews. It just confirms how uptight their religion has made them. Comedians make fun of religion all the time to make people laugh.

Many of the medieval folk feel this disaster will destroy everyone if it's not somehow stopped.Black Death From a medieval person's point of view, they didn't know much about biology. When entire villages were wiped out by a mysterious, nasty disease, they thought it was either caused by witches or by an angry God. They flailed around trying to do something - anything - to get it to end.Into this mix comes a group of religious men. Osmund is a quiet monk who is torn by his love for a woman. He wants her to get somewhere safe from the plague. Ulric is a knight who's on a quest to examine a village which apparently is safe from the plague. Along with them go various other miscreants.The movie keeps you guessing. Are there supernatural elements? Is what they are seeing real? This is useful because it helps the viewer get into the mindset of medieval people. From their point of view, some elements of human biology *were* supernatural. I wasn't that fond of the ending, as I find it doesn't add to the story, but I'm sure others might find it fitting.They did a good job on the historical side. Not perfect, but then again most movies are far worse. The plague years were gritty, run down, rough, and full of intense emotion. People had no idea what to do. It seemed as if the world were about to end. The clothing and architecture is fairly accurate. So many movies make the middle ages seem like a eat-off-the-floor-clean wonderland. It wasn't. Especially not these years.Interestingly, for Game of Throne fans, both Sean Bean (Eddard Stark) and Carice van Houten (Melisandre) play key characters in this movie.Well recommended.",4,A Rough Time to Live In,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,1739,"['Black', 'Death', 'intriguing', 'movie', 'set', '1348', 'England', 'black', 'plague', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'Many', 'medieval', 'folk', 'feel', 'disaster', 'will', 'destroy', 'everyone', 'not', 'somehow', 'stopped.Black', 'Death', 'medieval', 'person', 'point', 'view', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'biology', 'When', 'entire', 'villages', 'were', 'wiped', 'out', 'mysterious', 'nasty', 'disease', 'thought', 'was', 'either', 'caused', 'witches', 'angry', 'God', 'flailed', 'around', 'trying', 'do', 'something', 'anything', 'get', 'end.Into', 'mix', 'group', 'religious', 'men', 'Osmund', 'quiet', 'monk', 'who', 'torn', 'love', 'woman', 'get', 'somewhere', 'safe', 'plague', 'Ulric', 'knight', 'who', 'quest', 'examine', 'village', 'apparently', 'safe', 'plague', 'go', 'various', 'other', 'miscreants.The', 'movie', 'guessing', 'Are', 'there', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'real', 'useful', 'viewer', 'get', 'mindset', 'medieval', 'people', 'point', 'view', 'elements', 'human', 'biology', '*were*', 'supernatural', 'was', ""n't"", 'fond', 'ending', 'find', ""n't"", 'add', 'story', ""'m"", 'sure', 'others', 'might', 'find', 'fitting.They', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'historical', 'side', 'Not', 'perfect', 'then', 'again', 'most', 'movies', 'are', 'far', 'worse', 'plague', 'years', 'were', 'gritty', 'run', 'down', 'rough', 'full', 'intense', 'emotion', 'People', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'seemed', 'world', 'were', 'end', 'clothing', 'architecture', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'So', 'many', 'movies', 'make', 'middle', 'ages', 'seem', 'eat-off-the-floor-clean', 'wonderland', 'was', ""n't"", 'Especially', 'not', 'years.Interestingly', 'Game', 'Throne', 'fans', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Eddard', 'Stark', 'Carice', 'van', 'Houten', 'Melisandre', 'play', 'key', 'characters', 'movie.Well', 'recommended']","Black Death (2010)  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom ]"

1397611,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B004DY3N9Y,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[4, 4]","If you expect exciting medieval adventures and swordfights, this movie is not for you. This film is in fact a story about a trial of faith imposed upon a small group of men in England, in time of possibly the worst cataclysm in history of Europe: the deadly plague of 1348-1352. This horrible epidemic killed 50% of Europe population in only four years (and probably as much as 60% of population of England, Wales and Scotland). There was no cure for the plague in this time and a great majority of people who became ill died - and their death was a horrible and painful one. This epidemic is generally known as ""Black Death"", but in my personal understanding of the movie, the title does not refer only to the plague (see below).The story takes place in 1348, somewhere in England (LIMITED SPOILERS FOLLOW). As the plague is killing hundreds of people every day, rumours start to circulate that there is an isolated village in the middle of marshes, which not only is magically protected from the epidemic but in which a necromancer raises the dead from their graves. Later, even worse things are told about this place, tales of blasphemous pagan ceremonies, human sacrifices and even cannibalism. Initially sceptical, local bishop finally dispatches his personal envoy and a group of soldiers to investigate. The movie will follow them as they go towards their destiny...The personal envoy of the bishop is a noble knight, Ulric (Sean Bean), a grizzled veteran of many wars, who recently lost all his family to the plague and for that reason is in deep mourning. Ulric is a wealthy man, quite educated for a provincial knight (he can read and write and even speaks Latin). He is a natural leader both feared and respected by his men and he is also a devout Christian, but his recent loss brought him to the verge of madness. He accepted this mission in part to keep his sanity by getting busy and forgetting at least partially the death of his wife and children.Ulric's second in command is Wolfstan (John Lynch), a middle aged man who seems to be a squire who never became a full knight. He is a tough man who makes his living with the sword in hand, but is also well spoken, honourable and good to his word.The rest of the group is a wild bunch of professional foot soldiers, tough and battle scarred veterans all of them. They served together in France under Edward III and fought in the great battle of Crecy in 1346. Griff (Jamie Ballard) is Wolfstan's best friend and they travelled and campaigned together for years. Swire (Emun Elliott) seems to be the youngest of the group, he is also the most talkative, the most wise-cracking and the only one who seems to really care about his clothes and haircut.Mold (Johnny Harris) is a rugged peasant who long time ago chose the battle axe other the scythe and never regretted the choice. Ivo (Tygo Germandt) was once captured by the French and later rescued by his companions - but not before his captors cut his tongue... Last but not least there is Dalywag (Andy Nyman), a man who once was a bandit, later became a mercenary and who now works for the bishop as torturer and executioner. At one moment Swire tells about him ""he is a torturer and executioner; he is also a thief, a murderer and a defiler of women - but other than that he is really a good man...""In his quest Ulric needs a guide who knows the local forest and especially the treacherous marshes. Being the personal envoy of the bishop he commandeers for this purpose Osmund, a young monk from a monastery near the marshes. Osmund, who is barely out of his teens, actually is quite eager to go, because he has his own agenda, which will have a considerable influence on the rest of the story...Once they reach their destination Ulric and his men expect to meet great danger in this isolated village and they will be served beyond their worst expectations! They will be tried and tested in their chair but even more in their faith - and the test will be so horrible that at one moment some of them will be ready to fight for the privilege of being tortured and killed because the alternative will seem too horrible to contemplate! Some will pass the test and some will fail - and in both cases there will be surprises...In my personal opinion to better understand the second part of the movie (the trial of faith) it is important to remember some fragments from the Bible. You should ponder the First Commandment, the story about Jesus being tempted by the Devil in the wilderness, the fragment which describes how Judas died and the passage of New Testament about the false prophets. It is also important to remember that one of the names of Satan is ""The Prince of Lies""...The Devil being present in every place and time where and when even a single human being lives, he is also very much present in this village. Unusual (at least for XIV century England) customs observed by the villagers and especially by their leader will allow the Prince of Lies to have some very special fun with the newcomers. The terrible trial of faith to which Ulric and his men will be submitted will decide if they save their souls or if they are damned and can be claimed by Satan.Now, Satan is of course interested in every human soul and tries to attract toward damnation as many people as he can, without ever giving up on anybody until his/her very last breath, but some are obviously more interesting than others. Ulric is so horribly damaged by his recent loss and in so much pain, that he is nothing more than a burned out wrecked empty hulk of a man he once was. His men all spend their lives killing, plundering and committing all other deadly sins - and with the possible exception of Wolfstan they are already more or less damned anyway. So dragging them to hell seems to not be much of a challenge for the Devil, but rather just a routine chore, necessary and useful but uninspiring, like repainting the outhouse...But with Osmund, this is a whole different story. He is very young (probably around 18), he is gentle and peaceful by nature and being an orphan he lived all his life protected by friendly monks and under tender care of the old abbot who raised him almost as a son he never had. Even if he is a sinner, as all men, the sheltered existence he led preserved him from most of the worst aspects of life - and therefore his soul is mostly innocent and pure. For the Devil, Osmund is the top prize in the game he sets and capturing this soul would be in devilish works the equivalent of painting the Sistine Chapel. It is also quite frequent that the purer the person before he/she turns bad, the worse will be evil he/she visits on the world. For all those reasons Osmund will be tried, tested and tempted in the worst possible way, with indeed devilish cunning and sadistic cruelty.But who gambles, takes the chance of loosing, no matter how loaded are the dice. And for that reason the final result will not be entirely satisfying for the Devil - although in my modest opinion he will still end ahead of the game... Ultimately, some of ""heroes"" will live and keep their chances to earn their salvation before their time comes. Some will die but save their souls. And some, be they dead or alive, will be claimed by the Devil and therefore suffer the real ""Black Death""...I found this movie devilishly clever and surprisingly good and I encourage everybody to watch it at least once and decide if it is worthy or if it should be sentenced to the purgatory of charity sale or even the damnation of garbage bin. Enjoy!",5,"The fight for our immortal souls is more terrible than war and plague - and the fate of the losers is indeed the ""Black Death""..",1326153600,"01 10, 2012",2012,7541,"['expect',

1397615,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004DY3N9Y,Mark Turner,"[14, 31]","I'll say up front two things about BLACK DEATH. The first is that it is a well made film, photographed well, acted well, directed well. The second is that it falls into a category of film I've tired of: trying to make Christians look responsible for every bad thing to ever happen in the world.The time is 1342 and England is being ravaged by the Black Plague. The smell of death floats across the air in every corner of every location that exists. The dead are carted to the roadside to be taken away and rotting corpses are nothing unusual.A monastery is no safer from the plague than anywhere else. Monks are dying just as the everyday citizens are. Young Osmond (Eddie Redmayne) is a monk early on in his life. Having sworn his life to God he also has done the forbidden by falling in love with childhood friend Averill (Kimberly Nixon). Insisting she leave town before she falls victim to the plague, she gives him a last chance: abandon God and follow me. She tells him she will wait for one week in the town they grew up in and then move on with her life.Once Averill leaves a new group enters. This is an emissary of the Bishop, a warrior named Ulric (Sean Bean) who is en route to find a town where it is said no one dies or is affected by the plague. He's looking for a guide and Osmond, having just asked God for a sign what to do, jumps at the chance since the town they seek is next to the one he grew up in. That town holds the chance of returning to Averill.The journey is slow moving as the men walk and one cart is pulled along, a cart that contains the tools of torture used to force confessions of witchcraft and necromancy from helpless victims. The warriors that accompany Ulric all have their own short tales to tell, how they came to this place and what they expect to find. Bloodthirsty and ready for action they get their chance early on.Near the town, Osmond sneaks off one morning to see if Averill awaits. To his dismay he only finds her cape drenched in blood and a group of thieves, weapons drawn. Osmond runs back and alerts the warriors who take up arms and battle the larger numbered thieves. They win but at what costs as one of their own lies dying and Osmond is wounded.Moving forward they come to the marshland that holds the mysterious city they are searching for. They enter and find the inhabitants at first inhospitable, but after pretending to seek sanctuary they are welcomed to spend the night. A pale and well groomed woman takes Osmond with her and tends to his wound with a poultice. The rest wander about trying to figure out which one is the necromancer, the wizard, that has taken this village under his wing.At dinner they discover that there may be more than meets the eye in this group. Are they truly bewitched? Are they pagans, worshipping the devil himself? Or is it just that this town is lucky? Perhaps they've discovered a secret that keeps them alive.In short order (and hopefully without giving too much away) a confrontation involving the warriors being forced to recant their beliefs in order to stay alive is offered and a discussion about the horrors inflicted on many because of their belief in Christianity ensues. Christians are depicted as believe like me or die while pagans are shown as understanding and compassionate yet eventually acting the same way. Follow my way or die. A twist ending feels more tacked on than a part of the whole.While both sides are shown to have terrible flaws in their religious backgrounds and thinking, the more damaging presentation is tossed at Christians. Certainly if you go back and check history you will find that Christians did some terrible things in the name of God (anyone ever heard of the Inquisition?).  But if all you had to go by was this film you'd think Christians did nothing but attempt to exterminate people and that pagans just wanted to be left to their own devices. The truth is a combination. Both sides did wrong at one time or another. To depict one as being more aggressive at it just shows us another movie maker taking a swipe at Christians.One thing this movie definitely illustrates. Those of us who can remember far back know of a time when Hollywood made movies like THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD, KING OF KINGS and BEN HUR. All of these movies painted Christianity in a good light. With the inclusion of historical ""accuracy"" into films in the late 60s, things changed. It was no longer considered cool. Weird religions started popping up and those new age followings were given a wider birth to be explored than Christianity. So what happened? Why did it become wrong to believe in God? And why is it that the only religion that seems to be fair game is Christianity?I can't give an answer to that other than to believe offers more restrictions than these new age religions. And God knows Hollywood doesn't want to be restricted from anything.In any event out of 5 stars I would give this movie 3 just for the quality of the production. Were it on content alone I'd have to slide down to 2. But if it were rated on the basis of how much it would offend or upset someone its 5 stars all the way. Perhaps I took it to hard or too serious. Then again that just might show the strength of my beliefs and their lack of the same.",2,TAKE A SWIPE AT CHRISTIANITY,1306540800,"05 28, 2011",2011,5281,"[""'ll"", 'say', 'up', 'front', 'two',

The second half of this movie has that gritty realistic vibe similar to many films of the 70's. It is creepy and I mean the real deal, genuinely creepy. The idea that evil will present itself with a benevolent face is nothing new, but it is done here in a spectacular way.  All I can say is while you are watching the first part of this movie it's good, but be patient because you're in for a real treat the second half.

Christianity is often portrayed in such a poor, weak, light, so it was refereshing to see people champion God in a meaningful way. Reminds me of Foxes Book of Martyrs. If you have never read this book, it is a powerful read. It gives actual accounts of Christians tortured for their faith during pre/post medieval times and is very inspiring. In one account a man is being burned at the stake and his legs and arms are gone. The ropes holding his head and torso to the stake burn away and he rolls onto the ground away from the fire. His accusers take a pitch fork and fling what is left of his body back onto the fire. While flying to the air with no arms and legs he can be heard singing and praising God!

This movie is not a horror movie , but a story about the horror of the time. IN fact some people did behave quite well during this disaster but in many other cases everything broked down and mobs killed jews and others, flagelents went down the roads beating their backs with whips. Whole towns vanished for good never to be seen again. ANd this was only a hundred years after the mongols had destroyed parts of eastern Europe. This movie depicts a group of men going after a village who they believe is using magic to stay plague free. And something like that could have happened. (people going after a plague free village), then they throw in a necromacer who supposedly can raise the dead. In the village the people have gone celtic in religion , and this point must be made , that storyline is highly doubtful. As by the 1300's celtic religion was forgotten almost completely.  Still this is a brutal and savage movie and the violence is very accurate looking. In fact people in those days went to public executions to watch people be hacked to pieces. Anyways, I wasn't sure if the woman was supposed to be a real witch or not. YOu'll have to watch this to find out. The blu ray looks very good and this actually played in the theaters on a limited basis. It was here in Colorado at a arthouse theater. This blu ray also features deleted scenes and other extras. The acting is very good because the great Sean Bean is in this one. It's pre ""game of thrones' and made in germany. It's supposed to be england though which doesn't matter.

This film takes the victims of a state-sponsored crime and makes them deserving of the crime, justifies the misdeeds of the perpetrators, and then cloaks it all in theological bull puckey about how devout the murderers and torturers are--they're the REAL victims here, the holy martyrs true to their faith, not the thousands of innocent women the church slaughtered.

1397622,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B004DY3N9Y,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 2]","I watched Black Death and Season of the Witch a week apart, which gives some perspective on what goes right and what goes terribly wrong in both films.  They both share a similar plot: during the Black Plague, holy knights (in both movies, Teutonic Knightss judging from their attire) are sent to retrieve a witch who is to be put on trial for her crimes, a crime tied to the plague.  In Black Death it's a town that avoids the plague and is rumored to bring the dead back to life; in Season of the Witch it's a witch who is believed to have caused the plague. Black Death features Sean Bean as Teutonic Knight Ulric, responsible for marching to the village to bring back the necromancer.In need of a guide, Ulric drafts novitiate monk Osmund (Eddie Redmayne) into service.  Osmund is in love with Averill (Kimberley Nixon) but has sent her away for fear that she will contract the plague - he joins the quest in the hope of reuniting with her.Ulric's ratag band of warriors includes Wolfstan (John Lynch), Wolfstan's friend Griff (Jamie Ballard), Dalywag the torturer (Andy Nyman), Mold (Johnny Harris), the mute Ivo (Tygo Gernandt), and chatty Swire (Emun Elliott).  This is one of those Seven Samurai-style films where the audience has to connect with the warriors quickly, so they are each given a signature weapon, combat style, or personality tic.  This is important because they're probably not going to all survive.  Also, it features Sean Bean, so they're all screwed.  SPOILER BEAN: It's become an ironic trope that every character Sean Bean plays is a flawed figure that dies heroically to atone for his sins (see Lord of the Rings, Equilibrium, Games of Thrones).The village, it turns out, is in fact untouched by the plague.  Hob (Tim McInnerny) seems like the leader, but Langiva (Clarice van Houten) lurks in the background with her modern ideas and her clean hair and makeup. Something else is going on here: Langiva belongs to a tradition predating Christianity.Black Death is far more interested in testing its protagonist's souls than it is in telling a compelling tale.  As TV Tropes put it, the film pivots on an ""idiot ball"" - a moment where the character's stupidity fuels the entire plot. The assembled suspicious, hardened warriors do something really stupid that lands them in hot water.  They get what they deserve.What happens next is either a startling revelation or very predictable. Black Death has a lot in common with The Wicker Man in that it features torture, reversed gender roles, and a test of faith in the face of pagan practices. What Black Death brings to the genre is the strengths and weaknesses of the men as they are slowly picked off one by one.This is not an uplifting film.  It's also surprisingly cerebral, discounting one gory combat scene. If you're a fan of Sean Bean (or maybe if you aren't) Black Death is worth watching.

What unfolds is a bleak and surprisingly intelligent examination of the time period and the religious paranoia that fueled it.

He surrounds himself with a posse of psychopaths, and together they romp through 14th Century England killing and maiming the insufficiently churched. This is the period  of the Black Death, which adds atmosphere as well as the title. The opening scenes feature a panorama of decaying corpses and scurrying rats. Corpses are a running theme throughout the movie.There is still one village that is as yet untouched by the plague. Apparently this is due to witchcraft. The protagonist, a young novice, volunteers to guide Bean and his Merry Men to the village, where they plan on capturing the village chief and embarking on the usual rape, pillage, and so forth. The twist is that the village is more than ready for them when they arrive. Without spoiling too much, its as if the gang had been transported through time and space toSummerisle.  I'll leave it at that.It's a well-done movie. The atmosphere of a countryside bewildered by, and under siege from the plague, is palpable. It's a bit like The Seventh Seal in that regard. Bean is quite believable as a inwardly tortured but outwardly fanatical heresy-hunter. (I did, however, fully expect him to announce ""winter is coming"". I couldn't shake Game of Thrones.)Unfortunately, as others have noted, the rest of the characters are somewhat one-dimensional. The guileless adolescent novice remains a guileless adolescent novice, even with the forced twist at the movies end. That is my second criticism. Cinematically speaking, the twist at the end of the film doesn't add much to the experience of the film. The kid turns out to be a witless schmuck, just like the rest of 14th Century society. I suppose that the coda's saving grace is it denies Eddie Redmayne any claim to heroism...which, I guess, is kind of the point of the film.When visited by something as horrific as the black death, no amount of flailing will suffice. Chances are you're not getting out alive.There is a fair amount of arterial spray in the film. Not something for the squeamish, but then I doubt the squeamish would acquire something called ""The Black Death"".

Overall loss of innocence and lots of questioning of the nature of good and evil? Check. Bad stuff happening all around? Check. Very well acted, directed, photographed and produced? Check.Black Death may not be the instant classic that A.N. is, but that's not the fault of the movie. It succeeds admirably in what it sets out to do.Just what it sets out to do, however, seems to be the major point of contention in most of the reviews I've read, on amazon and elsewhere.Did I see this movie as an anti-Christian screed, as so many ""Christian"" reviewers seem to?* Nope. nor did it come across as anti-religious, pro-atheist or any other such thing.Is it a largely accurate portrayal of a bleak period in human history, with some fancified elements added to spice up the plot? Sure thing!  Those days are referred to as the DARK AGES for several reasons: ignorance abounded, life was short and often brutal, and those two factors often acted together to help keep most of Europe  (and the Middle East, and North Africa) miserable. The church, like it or not, was a big part of all that. Best take off your rosy glasses and face it.I would dearly love it if the revisionist/apologist historians of the world, no matter what their faith (even the atheists and heathens), would keep said faith out of movie reviews, stop seeing devils hiding behind every door, and just generally mellow out. Life could be so much better. Sometimes I wonder if those folks are trying to bring about a new dark age for all of us - but I digress.Is Black Death a perfect film? No. Is it far, far above average? Yes! If you like your historical drama on the raw and bloody side, mostly accurate with some fantastic elements thrown in, and really really Really DARK, this is your movie. Could easily (if somewhat unfairly) be described as Season of the Witch with 95% less hokey BS/Nicholas Cage.If you want squeaky-clean peasants talking about how well-treated they are under their feudal landlords, fluffy animals dancing and singing, or sugar-coated anything, this one ain't for you.Haven't seen the Blu-Ray, just the DVD and on the big (or, more accurately, medium-sized) screen.

The real story here is about the Church and how it used its power to force people into line using savage mercenaries who would murder you without remorse to ""save you"".

I am glad that I did! Great movie! It is definitely well crafted, pulls you right in and has you wondering what is going to happen next. I find it really amazing when I think about it, how so many people ended up being killed simply because a certain behavior was perceived as abnormal by someone of a superstitious mind. The interesting thing is that this pattern is still seen today, but just in a more sophisticated form. I really like how the movie captured the young monk's inner quarrels, his doubts, his challenges with regards to his faith. I love how the movie depicted the chaos that was prevalent at the time. How our human fear of the unknown often compelled us (and continues to do so)to ""create"" knowns and become attached to them, and as Alan Watts once put it; forget that it was I who ""created"" the idol. This movie has great twists and I love the flow that was gained as the plot progressed. Much like making love. Momentum starts to gather and it inevitably reaches the point of climax. This movie unfolds into a situation where you are gripped to your seat wondering how the story will end, for it is as if there are no conventional, already conceived cookie-cutter ways that the story can possibly end! And that is the beauty! You have no idea where things will go next!I would like to extend a word of caution though, there were parts in this movie that were clearly intended to give the viewer a close as possible taste of ""reality,"" of what you would have truly seen had you been there back then if you had witnessed actual hand to hand battles, etc. In other words, the sensoring as to what would happen to the body in actual hand to hand combat situaitons were not watered down or downgraded as far as editing is concerned. So if you are sensitive to such scenes, then you might not want to see this movie. I, personally feel that for a movie expressing such hostical context, that those scenes were quite necessary, a crucial tangent of the overall story.Anyway, I don't mean to write my own book here, but I just wanted to share that this movie effectively pulled me into its plot and allowed my mind to go on an adventure through time.

1397640,AB6BQXTOMO7F7,B004DY3N9Y,PJS1975,"[6, 18]","Filmed in Germany, ""Black Death"" takes place in medieval England, while the Bubonic Plague (which killed almost 50% of England's population in a few months) is ravaging the land.The story: a young monk, Osmund (Eddie Redmayne), is charged with guiding the Bishop's envoy - a small cohort of mercenaries and slayers led by the knight Ulric (Sean Bean, in an outstanding-as-usual performance) - to a remote marsh-surrounded village whose population appears to be immune to the plague, and which, for reasons never fully explained, has embraced godlessness and irreligion. Ulric has information that this village has ""turned its back"" on God and now he's traveling there to arrest, judge, and execute the presumably diabolical ringleaders that have led the villagers to apostasy. But Osmund has an ulterior motive in leading Ulric's group to the village: he is trying to keep a secret tryst with his forbidden love, Averill (Kimberley Nixon), who awaits him in the forest. With set-pieces that range from bleak battles and Bosch-inspired horror imagery, to scenes of eerie, depopulated, pastoral weirdness, ""Black Death"" manages to create an atmosphere of a civilization in the midst of upheaval, without going over the top in the creation of plague-scarred landscapes and hospital-morgue gore.In the end, this film puts a simple, but nonetheless thought-provoking, question to its viewers: ""When you have absolute faith in something, and you act accordingly, and later you find out you erred horribly in your decision to follow your faith, what do you do then? How do you, knowing full well your error, live the rest of your life as one of the faithful?""In the final scene of ""Glengarry Glen Ross"", it was clear to most viewers that Ricky Roma (Al Pacino) found it easier to respond to Shelley Levene's (Jack Lemmon) situation by continuing to act like the consummate salesman, instead of responding with shock, sympathy, disgust, or some other form of genuine emotion. No, instead Roma acted like the salesman all the way to the end, and up to Shelley's eventual demise, because, to Roma, that was an easier way for him to deal with the situation than it was to confront the truth.At the end of ""Black Death"", it appears Osmund (Eddie Redmayne) decides, similarly, to buy into what Ulric (Sean Bean) said to him earlier in the film: that demons and necromancers are indeed among us, corrupting the world with their diabolical evil; despite what Osmund himself had found to the contrary. And so, Osmund becomes the consummate witchfinder and destroyer of many innocent women. Guilt drives him to it; Osmund finds this is an easier way for him to deal with his life - to perpetuate this idea of witches and necromancers - than it is to confront the truth of the terrible thing he has done. It's easier to believe that the ""evil witch"" brought this great evil onto him, instead of believing the fact that he, Osmund, himself performed the evil act, and in God's name to boot.Which brings us to the next question this film unintentionally raises: why must Christians always whine like little children crying ""It's not fair!"" whenever their made-up, fairytale, completely fictional religion is portrayed in anything other than a 100% positive light?Because, for Christians, painting themselves as ""victims"" and their detractors as ""unreasonably critical and unjust"" is an easier way to deal with the fact that their religion, like so many others, has racked up a tremendous body count through the centuries, and continues to do so, without any evidence whatsoever that their god actually exists. This is what they must do, because the fact that every atrocity attributed to the Christian religion through the centuries was performed by actual, living, believing Christians who were acting according to their faith - doing things ""in the name of God""- is a truth too difficult for them to confront honestly. No, it is easier for today's Christians to cop-out with the ""a few bad apples"" explanation, and then revile all their critics for being ""unreasonable and unjust.""

But the young monk is suffering from a bit of a crisis of faith (well not faith - it's just that he's in love with a girl and wants to find a way to serve God AND get the girl).

The best thing about such a specialization is that it's highly portable; you can apply it to pretty much any genre and come up with a winner. Here, he tackles the historical-drama-with-a-subgenre-of-Inquisition, which has been played out approximately since Cecil B. DeMille was a pup, and once again comes up with something quite nice. It does lack the humor of Smith's earlier films, but I've gotta say, I was okay with that. (And I did not expect to be.)If you need any further convincing, well, have a look at the cast list. The abbot (David Warner. I mean, DAVID WARNER.) of a German monastery hires a band of mercenaries headed up by the amoral, violent Ulrich (Sean Bean... the list of people here who will need no introduction is just gonna keep going, folks) to investigate a town located in the center of a nearby swamp that seems to be immune from the Black Plague. Ulrich, who doesn't really believe in divine providence and Satanic protection from disease and all that sort of thing, opines that, perhaps, marsh gas is providing a natural air filter that keeps out the bug, but the abbot is having none of that. A young monk, Osmund (Eddie Redmayne), offers to guide the band through the swamp, partially to get out and get some experience on the road, but partially because his betrothed, Averill (Angus, Thongs, and Perfect Snogging's Kimberley Nixon), has fled the city because of the plague and is currently hiding in the village where the party is bound...or so he hopes, having had no word from her. Once they get there, and the trip is fraught with all sorts of dangers, they find the wild animals and bandits in the woods are nothing compared to Langiva (Carice van Houten&#8212;and she was cast only after both Famke Janssen and Lena Headey had to drop out because of scheduling conflicts!), the suspected witch trafficking with the devil to keep the plague out of the village, who happens to be mind-meltingly hot, and pretty durned good with herbs besides (as soon as the group gets into town, she takes Osmund, wounded in the side during a battle, and fixes him up but good with poultices and bandages). While the main plot plays out about the way you'd expect it to, we get a very interesting subplot here: is Osmund going to hold fast to Mother Church, or will Langiva's kindness and good deeds usher in Osmund's own personal Age of Reason?Oh, and did I mention that Ulrich's band of merry men contains Emun Elliott (Prometheus), Johnny Harris (Atonement), Smith regular Andy Nyman (The Brothers Bloom), Tygo Gernant (Godforsaken), and John Lynch (In the Name of the Father)? This movie is not hurting for starpower one bit&#8212;that's one of the little bits of magic that Christopher Smith regularly brings to his movies&#8212;and talent will out just as much as truth will. You could put a merely competent director in a movie with this much talent in it at the helm and it would be worth watching; someone like Smith can take this crew and guarantee you a good time.

I mean, could this movie have been any more anti-Christian??  I guess that's the price Christianity pays for being the world's more dominant religion.  This movie is VERY loosely based on fact, and more based on witches, wizards, evil, and oh yeah, the plague.  But the plague is the last thing on your mind here as a few warriors with the help of a young monk who is really trying to search for his lost love try to find the ""root cause"" of the pestilence, which at that time was strongly believed to be the workings of witches and witchcraft.  Magic and witchcraft was the science back then, and nowhere was there a scientist to tell them that it was probably the rats and dreary conditions Europe lived in all along.Instead,  this movie wants the viewer to focus on the ""evils"" of Christianity and perhaps religion in general, and how Christians have killed more people in the name of ""God"" than anything else.  This is a very dark movie with none other than a divisive message for the viewer to take with him.  Seeing as this film is a European production, I'm not surprised on its content.  Europe separates itself from religion more and more as each day goes by.  A movie like this would not probably fly that well in the States.

It made for a frequently jerky presentation which didn't really lend anything to the ability to enjoy the action scenes more. The technique won't be new to you; many movies made during the past ten years or so have used jerky action scenes, so it's gotten to be ordinary fare.As for the good-versus-evil, ""why did God let this happen?"" aspects of the story, well, you'll have to come to your own philosophical conclusions.

This leads one monk to question his beliefs, and leads him on a quest to help a group of men as they search for a secluded town. This eventually leads the monk to question just about everything, including a love he was not supposed to have and whether or not the Black Death is something that is  prodded along by faith or a lack therein.Black Death seemed, at first, to be a period piece that would be something like Black Robe. not the content, just the type of movie. It had the clothing and the suffering down, and it had a lot of the pieces to the puzzle inside it. Basically you have a monk that is asking if faith is something that is really form fitting for him or not, and you have him willing to leave the peace of his home to find out. While I was not certain whether or not this would be a good thing, i was sure that it would be a decent movie. Then the movie gets better, and it is because of a piece of the puzzle you do not see coming.While there is a lot more to the story it would be ruinous to say much more, I can add that the movie is indeed a bit different. From the addition of the walking Plague Doctors to the people you see punishing themselves, you have an eclectic landscape that seems to be well-drawn. You also have a group of men that are traversing the land in search of a town, and you start following and questioning why.

The plague does not touch them there and the question is why? So they set off and of course there is danger and surprises and gruesome imagery. It actually gets less interesting as they come upon the village because the plot becomes more contrived and quite predictable and just plain odd.

And when people don't understand something, they tend to turn to supernatural explanations, madly grasping for SOMEthing that helps them make sense of their world.Basically the story involves a group of knights/warriors given a mission by a bishop to find a small village that has somehow escaped the ravages of the plague, and because it HAS avoided the infection, there must obviously be some supernatural evil goings-on and wrongs that must be righted (at least according to the church and the ever-faithful who follow it).Sean Bean turns in a solid performance as a knight/believer wholly bought-in to his mission to carry out the church's sense of justice and apprehend and deliver to the bishop whoever it is who has been cavorting with the devil.  Bean does have a palpable presence in all these swinging-sword-flicks, honed in part with his role in ""Lord of the Rings"" and it helps give this movie a bit more weight.  And that's good because at times it seems almost like a ""made for tv"" effort.  There is a bit of gore, and the story does seem a bit contrived as to propel the story in a very specific direction, but I liked the fact it wasn't TOO preachy.Bottom line take away from the story (for me anyway) is ""it's never prudent to blindly follow ANYbody or ideology.""  Neither the church nor some self-appointed pagan guru has all the answers.So, that's what I got out of it anyway.  Not a great flick, but good enough, and it did hold my interest, and that's a feat in itself.

This movie tried to combine them all - and actually did a fairly decent job.  It could of been a solid 3 star beauty in the rough.  HOWEVER, I'm getting a little miffed at movies that have an anti-hero ending simply to make it more artsy or make the director feel like there's some kind of deep meaning.  Some life changing moment in film.That's fine and dandy if your owning a 5 star file (for instance Cold Mountain - kills the hero and still ends up being a fine movie).  Or your solid Trauma type movies like ""Hobo with a shotgun"" - ending MAKES that movie a solid 3 star gore fest.If your a decent little 3 star movie and your going for that 4th star by killing your hero, just don't do it.

1397668,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B004DY3N9Y,Wuchak,"[2, 4]","There's been some controversy over 2010's ""Black Death."" The film has been interpreted in every which way by Christians, pagans, religionists, agnostics and atheists. Either its message is too deep or it's just ambiguous.I believe I have it figured out and will share evidence at the end of this review.THE PLOT: The year is 1348 and England is plagued by the Black Death. The Roman Church learns of a remote village that has eluded the plague and suspect sorcery. They send their knight Ulrich (Sean Bean) and a team of hardened soldiers to investigate. On the way they enlist a young monk to lead them to the village, Osmund (Eddie Redmayne), but he has ulterior motives in taking the assignment: He hopes to reunite with Averill, a girl who took sanctuary in the monastery but recently left due to the plague. The monk and the soldiers are all professing believers, but will their faith withstand the ultimate testing?The film has high production values and was shot in NE Germany.The story pulls you in before the first act is over. But it's the final act where the film's greatness really emerges. This part of ""Black Death"" took me by surprise and reveals that it's not really a film about the Black Death, at least not literally. The era of the bubonic plague is just a stage for a grueling exploration into personal belief in God, whether true faith or false.Two important characters are introduced in the second half: Hob (Tim McInnerny) and the beautiful Langiva (Carice van Houten), the authorities of the village. Carice is exceptional.A couple sequences show true cinematic excellence: A scene where Langiva leads Osmund out into the night marsh for an amazing revelation, and later when Osmund searches through the misty reeds while Langiva conveys the awful truth.The lengthy water-pit sequence also stands out just for being so excruciating and is on par with the initial Russian roulette sequence in ""The Deer Hunter"" but with more meaning since the outcome in ""Black Death"" hinges on the victims' faith or lack of faith and the everlasting outcome. If Christianity is true, those who denounce their faith have nothing but eternal black death to look forward to.""Black Death"" is reminiscent of films like ""Witchfinder General,"" ""The Wicker Man,"" ""The Last Valley"" and maybe ""Ravenous."" ""Black Death"" is as good or better.GRADE: A***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the film)MY EXPLANATION:Osmund was never a believer. He may have had some positive qualities but he simply wasn't a believer and the clues are there from the very beginning: For one, he was fornicating with his girlfriend and jumped on the first excuse to leave the monastery so he could see her again (using prayer and a ""sign from God"" as a cover - even a cover for his own delusion). In fact, Averill told him, ""You've ALREADY betrayed God."" Secondly, Dalywag points out that his purpose as a torturer was to sniff out lies and tells Osmund to his face that he's a lie. Speaking of Dalywag, despite his gruff exterior and occupation, he later proves his genuine faith as the first person to be crucified for it. Thirdly, Langiva (the red witch) said she looked into the eyes of each visitor when they arrived and saw that Osmund was the only one who wasn't out to harm them, meaning she pegged the others as believers, but not Osmund. Remember, the ""eyes are the windows of the soul."" Fourthly, although Osmund didn't vocalize his denouncement of God he readily got out of the water pit to view his girlfriend in the cottage. Fourthly, Osmund openly disagreed with Ulrich and the soldiers about Langiva and the villagers. Why? Because he was actually one of them, an unbeliever, whether he knew it or not. And lastly, the end plainly shows what became of Osmund: He became a lifeless and bitter false accuser who cruelly tortured and slew in the name of the church. Remember, Jesus said you can recognize false prophets by their fruits (Matthew 7:15-23).Some object to Osmund being a fake believer on the grounds that he was a monk and lived in a monastery, not to mention he prayed. But these things don't make you a believer any more than being in a garage makes you a vehicle. True belief is a matter of the heart, not putting on airs of religiosity, like the Pharisees whom Jesus denounced as fakes.The very first sign that Osmund wasn't a true believer was his seduction by Averill's beauty and his subsequent unrepentant spirit. At the end of the film when Hob is apprehended and caged he's asked why he follows the red witch and he replies, ""Because she's beautiful."" Hence, both Hob and Osmund were alike in that they renounced faith due to the seduction of beauty.Although depicted as brutal witch-hunters, Ulrich and his team were RIGHT regarding their suspicions of the marsh village - the people HAD renounced God and witchcraft WAS being practiced, albeit in a partially charlatan form. Of course it's wrong to persecute people simply because they don't believe in God or adhere to pagan beliefs, but this was a different time and place, when the Anglican Roman Church was the state religion.Although Swire proved to be a fake believer and is actually an obvious type of Judas, Ulrich, Wolfstan, Dalywag and the other surviving soldiers proved their genuine faith and escaped the ""black death"" of eternal death.The idea that Osmund was the protagonist is a red herring. Ulrich and Wolfstan - gruff and flawed as they are - are the true protagonists of ""Black Death."" Besides his courageousness in the face of martyrdom, Ulrich cries out to the villagers in no uncertain terms, ""Repent before it's too late - Repent!""",5,Do you REALLY have faith?,1349222400,"10 3,
