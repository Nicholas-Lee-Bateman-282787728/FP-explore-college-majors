I'm not a big fan of Randy Travis' music, but thought he did a pretty good job as Michael Steel, the blockbuster movie star with the wholesome image whose world falls apart as the devil and God place a bet on his soul.  You really feel sorry for him as the viewer, because you know he didn't do anything wrong, and just when you think all is lost, God turns everything around in the end, although he has been reaching out to Michael all along.  It doesn't hit you over the head with too much preachiness like The Encounter, so more secularly based people are likely to warm up to it too, and it still gets a very clear message across about doing the right thing.

It begins with Michael hearing the Rev.John Hagee on the radio or TV. The Rev. Hagee proposes a ""wager"", can you maintain your faith, if you lose your career, your spose, and your reputation? Well Michael is really put to the test in this movie, because he loses all three.First, he is currently working on the filming of a movie, and the director wants him to film a sex scene. Michael says that is not up for discussion. He said they had an agreement that he would not film any sex scenes. The director pressures him, but Michael continues to refuse, so the director fires him.Next, his wife tells him she is leaving him, and has filed for a divorce. Michael is served the divorce papers.The day Michael was fired from the movie business, he had taken an 8 year old boy along, who I think is the son of his sister. Anyway, he takes the boy on home with him. An actress who Michael has worked with drops by Michael's home. She tries to get him to do the movie scene. Michael gets mad, she leaves, Michael follows her out the door, and so does the little boy. The media is at his gate watching the event. They accuse Michael of not wanting the woman, and falsely accuses him of having an affair with the 8 year old boy. They falsely accuse him of being a pervert, and child molester. Thus, he loses his reputation.Then Michael's mother dies.However, Michael holds on to his faith. On the way to the Academy Awards, Micheal has the limo driver to stop. He says he knows he as to be at the location where the boy is, but he don't know why? His manager thinks he's crazy. Randy goes to the boy's home and finds a grown man beating the boy. Michael intervenes, and beats up the man, and makes sure the boy is okay.The cops are called, and Michael is vindicated from the child abuse accusations. He also won the Best Actor Award which his wife accepted for him. He gets his career back and his wife back and his reputation back. So, he won the ""wager"".This is one of those movies that leaves you with a happy feeling. Randy is a great actor. This is a great movie about holding on to your faith under adverse conditions.
