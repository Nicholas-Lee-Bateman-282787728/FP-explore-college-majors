Just recently I saw Masterpiece Theater's rendition of Pollyanna and was instantly in love.  Having watched M.T's rendition, I then wanted to see that old disney classic I remember loving so much.  HAving just watched the disney version, I can't make up my mind which I love more, the PBS version or Disney's.  They each have their good points.  Haylee Mills is MUCH more adorable.  I mean, come on, who doesn't adore Haylee Mills.  I was rolling during the fire and brimstone speech by the reverand!  My goodness, it was a wonder anyone showed up for church with sermons like that!There were a few differences between the movies.  PBS's version had Pollyanna get hit by an automobile which then consequently  causes Nancy to call off her engagement to the George, while Disney has Pollyanna fall off of the roof, which was much more edge of your seat.  It almost happens in slow motion.  The PBS version you don't know right away who the old love interest of Polly was.  It's a bit of a mystery.  I'm assuming that the PBS version goes more by the book, but I'm not sure just yet.  I have  yet to read it.  Also the two endings were different.  Disney's Pollyanna she is still paralyzed at the end, while PBS's she's walks down the isle to be the flower girl for Aunt Polly's wedding to Dr. Ch---  (I can't remember his name.)Either way Both versions were wonderful...With the exception of Disney showing the random 12 year old boys bottom in the very first scene.  What was that about?  No foul language, one use of the Lord's name in vain, with an immediate appology for doing so.  Check out both versions!!

I was pleasnatly surprised and even moved afterwards.Pollyanna is a delightful movie that lifts the spirits and provides many life lessons without ever being preachy or feeling like a school lesson.  I was genuinely entertained and even a bit surprised at the bold steps the movie takes.  Would you think this movie features a preacher most everyone fears, or has a bittersweet ending?  I thought not.  Well there's plenty more here to surprise you.  Just give it a chance.About the only thing I fault the movie for is being a bit too long.  Some scenes just seem to go on and on, but that's what chapter stops and the fast forward button are for.As for the DVD presentation, it's terrific.  The movie looks and sounds stunning plus the second disc is just jammed packed with extra material.  I was excited to listen to the commentary, but sadly it's as sugary and full of fake emotion as the movie is not.

Hayley makes her first appearance in a Disney movie in this lovely story about a little orphan girl sent to live in Harrington with her aunt Polly, who controls the town founded by her family. In living there Pollyanna preaches the gladness of the heart and bring it into those of most cross townspeople. Everyone is pefect in their performance, especially Miss Mills' who even won an Oscar for hers. Disney really has the formula when it comes to family films and this one proves it while sending out a very positive message. Hayley Mills is one of my very favorite actresses and this movie is a tear-jerker even for someone (me) who only once cried in 2 movies including this one. It is purely WONDERFUL.This movie is part of a The Walt Disney Classics' Hayley Mills Collection with The Parent Trap, That Darn Cat!, Summer Magic &amp; The Moon-Spinners which are all as fubulous as this one.

411152,A2P1C75HUR3P3X,6304285396,Catherine G. Hamilton,"[5, 5]","""Pollyanna"" is an underappreciated masterpiece. Everything was done right. It is one of those projects where you cannot fault anything, and the casting is impeccable. Most of all, this story is moving and has a beautiful, inspiring message.Hayley Mills is given her first starring role, and undoubtedly makes ""Pollyanna"" everything that it is. Unlike other child stars, Mills is totally natural, and gives the impression of spontaneity, honesty and frankness that is refreshingly charming. She plays a little girl who comes to live with her aunt Polly in the town of Harrington after her parents have died, and ends up transforming the whole town into an appreciative, kinder, GLADDER community. Her trick? That magic she has of reminding everybody she meets how much there is of life to be thankful for.This is not an overly sugary movie, as it might at first seem. It is a touching tribute to life and love, and a nostalgic depiction of the community atmosphere of a small town at the turn of the century. The movie is also a major tear-jerker, so be warned.What I love most about ""Pollyanna"" is the way it shows a cross-section of people from the town of Harrington and the way their lives are brightened by the presence of a child.

It centers around a new girl in town who is very refreshing with her positive outlook on things.  The color is vibrant and the characters very funny.

411160,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,6304285396,Classic film buff,"[1, 1]","Hayley Mills in this her first film for Walt Disney not only became a bona fide star, but also won the very last Academy Award bestowed for the best Juvenile Performance of the year. She was in fine company previous winners were Shirley Temple, Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland and Margaret O'Brien. After Ms. Mills win, children were nominated in the regular acting categories and sometimes won such as Patty Duke and Tatum O'Neal.  At any rate, young Ms. Mills absolutely deserved her Oscar, she is the pivot of the whole film, and ""Pollyanna"" ultimately succeeds due to her.Based on a 1913 bestselling novel by Eleanor Porter ""Pollyanna"" had been both a successful stage play and a silent film starring Mary Pickford in one of her most remembered roles.  In this remake, Walt Disney made some changes all to the good.  Writer/Director David Swift with Disney's collaboration and approval fashioned an excellent script. The story takes place in 1912 in a New England town called ""Harrington"" where Polly Harrington (Jane Wyman) a cool, repressed spinster is the town's wealthiest woman and more or less controls the town.  Her young, orphaned niece Pollyanna Whittier (Hayley Mills) comes to live with her.  Pollyanna's open friendliness and optimistic view of life effects a positive change on all with whom she comes into contact, such as the misanthropic recluse Mr. Pendergast (Adolphe Menjou), the crotchety hypochondriac Mrs. Snow (Agnes Moorehead), and the town's troubled minister Reverend Ford (Karl Malden). Still, Pollyanna's relationship with her Aunt Polly remains unresolved, as Polly keeps Pollyanna at arms length and is complicated by the return of Aunt Polly's old beau Dr. Edmund Chilton (Richard Egan). Polly and he still have strong feelings for each other, but clash over the fate of the town's decrepit orphanage which was built by Polly's father.Director David Swift had come from television, and Walt Disney chose him personally to direct this, Swift's first feature film.  He does a fine job, and would do even better the next time out with Hayley Mills in the Disney smash hit ""The Parent Trap"".  The production is quite handsome, great care and loving attention is given to recreate an idealized view of America in the halcyon first part of the twentieth century, similar to that of the earlier masterpiece ""Meet Me in Saint Louis"".  The location settings in Santa Rosa, Petaluma and the Napa Valley in addition to the Disney Studio in Burbank, CA were wise choices serene and idyllic.  You believe you're back in 1912 in a small New England town, the color and lighting is warm and bright, and sun dappled since most of the scenes are filmed outdoors.  You feel you can almost breathe in the pure fresh air of an innocent, more simpler time, and temporarily let go of the stresses of the twenty-first century.  The bazaar sequence is a prime example, with it's huge hunks of watermelon being sold for one cent apiece, the slabs of homemade layer cake, the big kettles of corn on the cob, the dunking booth and the sprightly geriatric band with their zippy tunes, check out the peppy lady drummer!  One of Hollywood's most gifted costume designers from it's Golden Era,  Walter Plunkett whose credits included ""Gone With the Wind"" created authentic period clothes that are beautifully done.  The set decoration by Emil Kuri and Fred MacLean is equally splendid down to the littlest detail of the cut glass prisms on the lamps, Polly's sprawling Victorian mansion is especially sumptuous and awe-inspiring.A very impressive cast of gifted, seasoned actors provided outstanding support to Ms. Mills and made her shine even more.  Nowadays you wouldn't see such an outstanding cast in one film, three Oscar winners, and three Oscar nominees.  Chief among them is Jane Wyman, who has to tread a very fine line in portraying Aunt Polly, she can't be mean to Pollyanna, and although reserved and proper, she can't be an ice maiden.  Ms. Wyman is able to suggest that Polly Harrington has lived alone for so long that although relatively young; she is set in her ways. Very conscious of her position as the town's leading and richest citizen, Polly has an interest or control in most of Harrington's businesses. She believes her way is the right way and over the years has become an autocrat.  This happy go lucky child disrupts her prim routine, and she doesn't know quite how to deal with her, although you feel she probably loves her but has difficulty expressing it.  A very good scene early on that features this ambivalence is when Pollyanna asks on her first night if she may kiss Aunt Polly goodnight.  You can see the conflict on Ms. Wyman's face when Pollyanna flings her arms around her, kisses her, and exclaims, ""I love you, Aunt Polly!""  She doesn't know how to react to this spontaneous display of affection, for a moment she's bewildered before she regains her customary poise.  As Reverend Ford, Karl Malden has a chance to emote strongly almost falling out of his pulpit when he thunders out a fire and brimstone sermon in the manner of the notorious Puritan minister Jonathan Edwards.  In more reflective moments he shows how Reverend Ford is torn between the spiritual and the temporal in the commanding presence of Polly Harrington.  One of classic Hollywood's best character actresses, Agnes Moorehead does wonders with the vinegary pseudo invalid Mrs. Snow who regains her will to live under Pollyanna's influence.  Nancy Olson is fetching as the warm-hearted maid Nancy, who befriends Pollyanna, Hayley Mills and she share a charming little duet.  Disney regular Reta Shaw and especially the sour faced Mary Grace Canfield are just right as the other domestics in Polly's household.  Veteran actors Adolphe Menjou and Donald Crisp register strongly, as does Richard Egan as Polly's love interest, Doctor Edmund Chilton.  Fellow Disney child actor Kevin Corcoran as the scrappy orphan Jimmy Bean is an ideal sidekick for Pollyanna.  Nods of appreciation should be given as well to Anne Seymour, Edward Platt, Leona Dana and James Drury.The centerpiece of course is Hayley Mills Pollyanna, and she is just superb.  Flaxen haired with deep blue eyes, young Ms. Mills is an ingratiating charmer.  The name ""Pollyanna"" is considered to be a synonym for a ""goody two shoes"", which in Ms. Mills playing she certainly is NOT!  She has spirit, as when she sticks out her tongue at the crabby maid Angelica, (Mary Grace Canfield), stands up to the initially ""scary"" Mr. Pendergast, winds up bossing him about in his own home and tells off the self-pitying Mrs. Snow.  When she first meets Jimmy Bean she is superior and dismissive, and she teases Nancy about her boyfriend George (James Drury). Her Pollyanna is also courageous, when she disobeys Aunt Polly to go to the fund raising bazaar for a new orphanage to fulfill her commitment, and even climbs down the towering tree outside her window to do so. She's really a fairly normal young girl, and she plays Pollyanna in a realistic matter of fact manner, as someone who just has a very optimistic positive attitude.  Ms. Mills is never cloying,sugary sweet or preachy and this saves the film from being overly sentimental and maudlin.The extras are extra good starting with a very informative and entertaining commentary by star Hayley Mills and writer/director David Swift.  Theirs is a mutual admiration society, which is fine since it seems genuine on both sides, and they would work again even more fortuitously in next year's ""The Parent Trap"". Just to give a quick preview it's revealed Walt Disney would be in tears after viewing the daily rushes of the film, and there is also a very funny story about Pollyanna's locket and the quote engraved upon it. Other highlights are ""Pollyanna: Making of a Masterpiece"" with contributions from Hayley Mills, David Swift, Nancy Olson, and Kevin Corcoran, and ""Re-Creating Pollyanna's America"" which both are very interesting, particularly the latter as to how the background was created, sets, costumes, hairstyles, furnishings etc.  There is included one of Disney's Mickey and Minnie Mouse color cartoons entitled ""Nifty Nineties"" and complements ""Pollyanna"" in it's period time frame, and is rather cute.  One of my favorites is from the Disney Vault, which shows Walt Disney introducing ""Pollyanna"" when it made it television debut on three consecutive Sundays on ""The Wonderful World of Color"" in 1963.  I was nine years old, and I remember seeing this, I loved seeing and hearing the theme song by the Sherman Brothers, and Tinker Bell flying over Cinderella's Castle while fireworks explode.  Watching this show was a staple of my childhood every Sunday evening, and Walt Disney's introductions until his untimely death in 1966 were always welcome.  It was a delight to me to see these again, and hear his comments on the film.  The only sour note is this extremely saccharine song that is sang by this male group of singers about Pollyanna played over a montage of scenes, odd since Walt Disney had made a point of downplaying this quality in the film.I was a Disney kid, and loved Hayley Mills's Disney films starting with this to her final one in 1965 ""That Darn Cat!""  My favorites were this, ""The Parent Trap"" and ""The Moonspinners"", and when I see them now I have a pleasant sense of nostalgia for my long ago boyhood.  If you are a Disney fan like me, you will probably have an extra fillip of pleasure watching this film.  If you're not, I still recommend you see it, the story, the production, and especially the performances will draw you in to its endearing charms. Walt Disney felt in retrospect that the title should have been changed, because even though the film got raves particularly for Hayley Mills, the film in it's initial run made only a slight profit, and that the title might have scared away the male population. Don't you be worried, this film has stood the test of time, title or no. Be sure you pay attention to the immediate opening shots, you'll be surprised by something you wouldn't expect to start a Disney film, and be sure to listen to David Swift's accompanying anecdote on the commentary, you'll be ""glad"" (to coin a phrase) to you did!",5,"""You'll be glad because it will be six whole days before Sunday comes around again!""",1373414400,"07 10,

411162,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6304285396,C. O. DeRiemer,"[15, 15]","I'll admit it...I like the movie. A lot. The story line -- the little orphan who unselfconsciously endears herself to others through her optimism and uncomplicated view of things -- could, in less expert hands, make a pig gag. Instead, and thanks in large part to Hayley Mills' performance, we have a sweet-natured family film which any number of adults may enjoy, especially if they watch it with their children. What I like about the movie:1. Hayley Mills. She was a child actor who had talent and an un-pushy, natural personality. She wasn't a little tricked-up beauty queen who looked like a cheap doll. She just seemed like a nice, shrewder-than-you'd-expect kid. I doubt if the movie would have worked anywhere near as well as it does without Mills. For a look at just how versatile and good she was as a child, look at the movies Tiger Bay made the year before Pollyanna and Whistle Down the Wind made the year after. These are complex, serious stories about children and adults. Mills does much to make them as good as they are.2. The by-play between Mills and Kevin Corcoran as Jimmy Bean. The two work well together without being icky. Corcoran was just about as unself-conscious a young actor as was Mills. The scene the two of them share with Adolphe Menjou when they first meet this mysterious old crank and then are taken into his home is fine ensemble acting before ensemble acting had a name.3. Adolphe Menjou. As the ironic, smart curmudgeon who finds he has a heart after all, Menjou gives an expert performance. Watch him as the manipulating lawyer in Roxie Hart; he's uproarious. Or the political general in Paths of Glory; he's reprehensible. He brings a lot of welcome skeptical relief to the movie.4. Jane Wyman. She had a tough role. We had to start out seeing her as rigid, judgmental, controlling and unsympathetic...then Wyman had to let us see a little vulnerability that would make us question our first impression...then Wyman had to let us see that Polly actually was a woman we might like and who could love a man.

Simply put, this is movie making magic at its' very best!Pollyanna is the simple story of a high-spirited young orphan girl who unknowingly touches the hearts and lives of everyone she comes in contact with.Beautifully filmed, lovingly told. This movie weaves its' wonders in a most unassuming and natural way.  All thanks to the superb script and deft direction of David Swift, in this his feature film directorial debut. With impeccable attention to detail, the immense love and great care that have been poured into this project, shows and radiates through in every single frame of film. It is has a richness of heart, and an honesty and integrity about it, that is rarely found in movies these days.Featuring what is possibly the most impressive cast ever assembled for a Disney feature, this film is filled to overflowing with outstanding performances and rich, totally believable, fully developed characterizations. Hayley Mills shines in the title role, deservedly winning the Oscar for the Most Outstanding Juvenile Performance of 1960. Her performance is brimming with brilliance and believability. Completely captivating, she is most convincing and constantly charming. Jane Wyman's portrayal of Aunt Polly is every bit as powerful as her Oscar winning performance in ""Johnny Belinda."" The whole cast is exceptional!  Karl Malden revels in his role as Reverend Ford.  Agnes Moorehead has the time of her life as crotchety old Mrs. Snow.  Not forgetting a young Kevin Corcoran, who delivers a delightful performance as the irrepressible, yet irresistible rapscallion, Jimmy Bean, just to name a few.The period is perfectly portrayed, capturing all the charm, atmosphere, elegance, and nostalgia of turn-of-the-century America. With lovingly lavished sets, stunningly stylish costume designs, the film is gorgeously grand!  All being further complimented and enhanced by Paul Smith's superb musical score, capturing perfectly the personalities and spirit of the movie.Pollyanna continues to remain my favorite film of all time. As time has passed, this movie has only improved with age, and will continue to do so for generations to come. It is a movie that celebrates life. And more importantly, shows us how to live. In this day and age of hustle and bustle, chaos and confusion, the message that lies at the heart of the film is as timely and important as ever. And one that we all need to be reminded of. A perfect gem of a movie and a pure joy!  Pollyanna will gladden your horizon, lift your spirit, and win your heart.PS - This DVD is jammed packed with the most awesome bonus material of any DVD release ever!

You fear being disappointed by what you found captivating as a child.  Oft-times the films seem just a little less ""well made"" or carefully plotted than films devoted to a supposedly more discerning adult audience.  I had fond memories of POLLYANNA, a film my older sister took me to see when I was eight (in fact, I had my first movie star crush on Hayley Milles),  but doubted that I'd find it as engaging as a grown-up.  After all,  the very term ""Pollyanna"" has certain negative associations, synonymous as it is with ""Goody Two-Shoes"" or just old ""goodie goodie.""  Naive optimism may be charming in a (fictional turn of the LAST century child), but does it speak to us jaded, post-modern viewers of the 21st century?Well, the answer is that it CAN, certainly.  It's all up to you, the viewer.  Pollyanna's sunny disposition, from an adult perspective, is actually an act of sheer willpower.  She's an orphan, after all, sent to live with strangers (her reserved Aunt Polly, whose welcome is tentative at best).  Her ""glad game,"" which was taught to her my her missionary father, is actually a conscious effort to put the best possible spin on otherwise dismaying events.  Positive thinking isn't all that easy in the face of adversity, especially if you're a 10 year old child.POLLYANNA also addresses, in its own innocent way, some theological or, at least, doctrinal issues.  Her gradual influence on the town's minister leads him to gradually disavow the grim fire-and-brimstone preaching that Pollyanna's influential Aunt Polly, who practically owns the town, seems to prefer in favor of a more optimistic--and dare we say, more New Testament--kind of teaching.  These were points that went over my head as an eight year old.What didn't go over my head at the time was the plight of nearly all the children in the film, since nearly all of them were presented as orphans.  The secret fear of nearly every small child, of course, is losing his or her parents.  I don't think I realized that by 1960, life expectancy had improved for nearly everyone on the N. American continent.  It probably didn't help that my hometown had a ""children's home,"" and I assumed (probably incorrectly) that the residents there were all children whose parents had died.That was such a haunting issue to me then me that to this very day, when I read a story about an orphan to a child, I always mention that nowadays things are different and only very few children experience the tragedy of losing both parents.  But the strength of a tale like POLLYANNA is that it shows how even a child can overcome extreme adversity and retain a sense of wonder and optimism.Hayley Mills received a Special Academy Award for her performance in this film, and she is indeed charming--and quite polished.  Her British accent seems to be explained away by the fact that her father is described as having been a ""missionary in the British West Indies.""  (Of course, most of her subsequent Disney roles had her playing American girls, and her accent was always simply ignored).  Her speech coaches did take pains, apparently, to coach her on the more-or-less standard pronunciation of ""aunt"" as ""ant,"" which might have been the one Britishism in her speech pattern they COULD have overlooked.  After all, if I am not mistaken, the story takes place in Vermont, and in New England (as in Olde England) most speakers would pronounce that word as ""ahnt.""  In fact, the speech coaches probably should have probably coached all the AMERICAN actors on a proper New England accent.That's a quibble, however, POLLYANNA is a charmer and well worth seeing after 47 years.  And it provides food for thought, for young and old to boot.

Confess I have not read the original book by Eleanor H. Porter.  The major theme of the movie is ""Look on the Bright Side!""  But a powerful minor theme, which is often overlooked in reviews is: ""No one can own a Church.""Pollyanna is the young girl of a poor Christian missionary, named after her wealthy aunt Polly.  When her father dies, Pollyanna goes to live with her Aunt Polly, played by Jane Wyman.Karl Malden plays the town's preacher, who takes his lead from influential aunt Polly Harrington, who seeks to impose her values upon the town.  She is always suggesting texts from the Bible which she thinks the preacher should be including in his sermon, and stressing as important to living a good life.  Karl Malden's sermons are, as a result of aunt Polly's interference, such blasts of hellfire and brimstone and filled with the punishments which evil-doers will encounter in the After Life, that everyone dreads going to Church.There is a fire at the local orphanage, which creates a sort of town crisis because it exposes how totally inadequate the orphanage is.  Most of the town's citizens and power-people want to tear down the orphanage and build a new one, but aunt Polly insists that because the orphanage is a public monument donated by her family that it should be restored.A group of people decide to set up a bazar entertainment event to raise money for a new orphanage, but the local newspaper refuses to accept an advertisement for the bazar.  Other business people chime in that they are afraid of Polly Harrington, and that they don't dare go against her wishes.  Someone grumbles that aunt Polly owns or controls one way or another almost everything that goes on in the town.  Pollyanna pipes up, ""She doesn't own the Church.""  ""What?""  ""Nobody can own a Church.""The townspeople go to the Preacher, hoping he will put his stamp of approval on what they are doing; but Karl Malden refuses to get involved.  In leaving, someone says, ""I guess Pollyanna was wrong.""  ""What do you mean?""  ""She said no one can own a Church.""My favorite scene is when Preacher Karl Malden is practicing his angry sermon in the countryside, shouting at the trees in the sunny Saturday afternoon, and Pollyanna wanders up to him to listen.  She has a note from aunt Polly for the Preacher.  Karl goes on ranting for a while before he notices that Pollyanna is there.  Pollyanna asks him if he likes being a preacher, and they get to talking about her father, and how her father sometimes couldn't seem to get through to his congregation.  Pollyanna mentions that her father read something once that helped him, and that he had it inscribed on a locket which she wears around her neck.  A quote from Abraham Lincoln.  Something like: ""If you look for the bad in people, expecting to find it, you surely will.""Pollyanna goes on to explain, that after that, her father started looking for the good in people, and that her father and her started looking for the Happy Texts.  ""The happy texts?""  Pollyanna explains that there are 800 happy texts in the Bible; and that if God took the trouble to tell us to be happy 800 times, he must have wanted us to do it!After Pollyanna hands Preacher Karl Malden the letter from aunt Polly she has brought for him (she has no idea what is in the letter), she wanders off.

411183,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6304285396,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","The term Pollyanna had already been floating around for decades when, in 1960, Disney released a film adapted from Eleanor H. Porter's classic 1913 novel. At the time critics were predicting doom and gloom for the Disney movie and, in fact, it apparently didn't fare too well in the box office. In 1960 folks had become cynical enough and were leery of checking out a film featuring that endlessly optimistic little glad girl. As it turns out POLLYANNA, starring an excellent Hayley Mills in her Disney debut, is actually a pretty good family flick and a well done slice of Americana circa 1912. But, yes, color it very sentimental.When her missionary father dies, eleven-year-old Pollyanna Whittier comes to live with her stern wealthy Aunt Polly in the morose little New England town of Harrington. Harrington is named after Pollyanna's grandfather, and as such Aunt Polly feels that she has a certain standard to uphold, certain obligations. Aunt Polly's influence spans deep and wide in the little community. She regularly administers charity on her neighbors, whether they like it or not.Pollyanna's father had long ago taught her to play the Glad Game, in which she is encouraged to look for the silver lining in every cloud. Pollyanna, newly moved in with her aunt, quickly begins to spread around her brand of sunshine, and her positive disposition soon garners her the ""glad girl"" nickname. In the face of such relentless optimism, the dour and dispirited residents of Harrington can't help but perk up. In short order, Pollyanna softens up both the meanest man and the crabbiest woman in town, plays matchmaker to several couples, and injects enough of a backbone into the cowed community so that it stands up to Aunt Polly's well-mannered tyranny, this last part having to do with a run-down orphanage in dire need of being razed and rebuilt (except that Aunt Polly wants the orphanage to remain as is).I saw this a long time ago as a kid, and I loved it back then. In watching it again as an adult, I was afraid that I would find it too cloying. But that wasn't so, not for me, anyway. POLLYANNA is as I remembered it, a warm, wholesome, entertaining family movie. And, yes, it does showcase the power of positive thinking. In fact, the central character invests the film with such a sense of rah-rah that it's a mild jolt when we arrive at the church scene in which the reverend Karl Malden goes on to rage and rant in his thunderous ""Death comes unexpectedly!"" sermon. Karl Malden is only one of the several well-known cast supporting Hayley. I thought that Jane Wyman, Agnes Moorehead, Adolphe Menjou, Nancy Olson, and Richard Egan were all very good. But, as always, when she's in a movie, it's really all about Hayley Mills. Others, including director David Swift, have commented before on how Hayley is so very spot on with her acting instincts. Pollyanna Whittier is a precarious part to play, as whosoever takes on the role will always be hard pressed to stay away from schmaltzy territory. But - and factor in, too, that this is only her second film - Hayley is savvy enough and accomplished enough and so darn appealing that she manages to offset the saccharine stuff. And, luckily for Hayley, there are moments in the film when Pollyanna seems to actually get fed up playing the Glad Game. Those moments are breaths of fresh air, and I actually liked Pollyanna better for demonstrating a less saintly side; it makes her more believable. With that said, I - rugged, brawny dude that I am - in recently watching this film, still got that lump caught in the throat when the whole town showed up in Aunt Polly's mansion to wish the gravely injured Pollyanna well. For those wondering if Pollyanna ever did get better, well, I believe Eleanor H. Porter wrote a sequel.Not too surprising that, during her stay at Disney, Hayley Mills ruled as America's top child actress (never mind that she's British). My favorite Hayley Mills flicks are THE PARENT TRAP (The Parent Trap (1961) and The Parent Trap II (1986): 2-Movie Collection (2-Disc Set)) andThat Darn Cat!, but POLLYANNA, a well-done film and still quite watchable, ranks right up there. It was certainly special enough that it garnered Hayley a special Oscar in 1961. Try to find a cloud in that silver lining.",4,"""Here it comes.

And the superb cast including Jane Wyman, Karl Malden and Agnes Moorhead make you long for the days when studios were able to create films with many ""stars"" instead of just one headliner.This two-disc DVD is also a great value.  The film looks crisp and beautiful despite its age, and the extras are fantastic.  There are two 30+ minute featurettes, ""Pollyanna - Making of a Masterpiece"" and ""Re-Creating Pollyanna's America,"" that go behind the scenes of filming and include interviews with Roy Disney, the director, Haley Mills, Kevin Corcoran and film historians.  They also include clips of Walt Disney talking about the film.  Both are excellent mini-documentaries and worth watching.  Also included is the original theatrical short, ""Nifty Nineties.""

This was the first Disney movie that Hayley Mills acted in. Mills plays Pollyanna Whittier, an orphaned girl who moves to Harrington to live with her rich aunt Polly(Jane Wyman). Most of the people in the town are cynical and depressed and Pollyanna cheers them up with her brand of optimism. David Swift takes some liberties with Porter's book. In the book, Pollyanna struggles to speak with Jimmy Bean, not the other way around. Aunt Polly's maid Nancy in the book has unrefined grammar and no boyfriend. Porter wrote a literary sequel titled Pollyanna Grows Up and, so far, it's never been made into a film.Walt Disney Home Video did a superb job with this special DVD edition of Pollyanna. They restored the video and audio quality. Yellow boxes that turned pink are yellow again. Hayley Mills' blue eyes are an ""Exorcist green"" in unrestored prints and now they're blue again! The second disc has interviews with David Swift and Hayley Mills. There's footage of Walt Disney himself hosting the TV broadcast of Pollyanna. There's a documentary with a man telling us about Technicolor, Walt Disney branching out into television, and how they restored Pollyanna. This DVD reminds us of going to the movie theater in 1960.

Pollyanna in a short amount of time manages to change the way those around her feel with her overlly cheerful nature-- from cinvincing a sick woman to get out of bed, to be-friending an orphan/finding him a home, helping her aunt Polly connect with her old flame, or helping a preacher join the community- before the town nows it they are just as cheerful as Pollyanna and boy are they glad she came into their lives. Even her aunt Polly who is usually stiff and un-emotional is changed by the cheerful girl. When Pollyanna falls while climbing a tree leaving her paralyzed the town now realizes it is their turn to help the little girl be glad about something... ending with a beautiful scene where everyone in the town comes to the house bringing presents, flowers, and animals to show Pollyanna how much she means to them.This movie is perfect and teaches the lesson that if we look for the good in others and remain positive we can change people's lives.

This town, like so many places really, is filled with unhappy people who have lost the ability to see that the life they've been given is full of blessings, that they have more to be glad of than they realize. Adolphe Menjou believes that everyone hates and fears him, Agnes Moorehead is a hypochondriac ruining her daughter's life, Karl Malden is a minister who can't preach anything but damnation, and Jane Wyman has stopped listening to her heart and only thinks of social status. These and others in the town are affected by Pollyanna's message of hope. Yet the biggest test of the Glad Game will be for Pollyanna herself, when she faces personal tragedy.This is one of Disney's Americana classics, the sort that Main Street USA in Disneyworld is based on. It's a funny, cheerful movie that is filled with workman like performances by many solid Hollywood performers, most of whom are bound to be familiar to any viewer who's owned a TV during the last couple of decades. Hayley Mills does give an exceptional performance for a girl of only 14, chock full of insight and charisma.Watch &quot;Pollyanna&quot; with the little boys and girls in your life--you'll all be &quot;glad&quot; you did!",4,&quot;What Do You Know?

411219,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6304285396,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[54, 55]","""Pollyanna"" was the first and, in my opinion, the best of the first six movies that Hayley Mills starred in for Disney, the others being ""The Parent Trap"" in 1961, ""In Search of the Castaways"" in 1962, ""Summer Magic"" in 1963, ""The Moon-Spinners"" in 1964, and ""That Darn Cat"" in 1965.  While all six of the movies are enjoyable family fare, this movie has a depth and complexity approached only in ""Summer Magic.""In the first thirty minutes a wide-eyed Pollyanna is witness to the power her Aunt Polly wields in her town, named Harrington after her family.  Pollyanna also quickly begins to learn that there are numerous stories in her town, which she learns throughout the movie piece by piece, ultimately giving her a power different from her aunt's.This movie takes place in the early part of the twentieth century.  Aunt Polly's genteel and Victorian behavior, even if a little stereotypical, has a feel to it that we often attribute to that era.  At one point Aunt Polly all but uses the term ""noblesse oblige,"" which is how wealthy people often considered their obligation to society.  The clothing and sets all appear to be realistic, enhancing the period believability.  The quality of the costumes and the sets is but one of the remarkable features of this movie.The background stories provide a field of torment and pain to enhance Pollyanna's consistently ""glad"" outlook on the world.  It is Pollyanna's attitude toward life that slowly changes the lives of everyone in Harrington, one person at a time.  Even better, Pollyanna teaches those she meets that it is okay to feel good, and to make others feel good.  Even more importantly, she teaches people to feel from the heart, which in many cases leads to love.  Hayley Mills was so skilled in this role that she was awarded a special Academy Award for most outstanding juvenile performance of 1960, the last such award given.The supporting cast for this movie can truly be said to be all-star.  Jane Wyman, who was nearing the end of a career spanning fifty years, is Pollyanna's initially grim Aunt Polly, who eventually learns that she should do things because she cares, not because of the obligation of the rich.  Agnes Moorehead, a veteran of more than 70 movies and a recurring character on the popular 60s television show ""Bewitched,"" is Mrs. Snow, a grumpy hypochondriac who has one foot in her casket, though there is actually nothing wrong with her.Karl Malden is fire and brimstone Reverend Paul Ford who manages to keep many of the faithful wide-eyed on Sunday; he is also under Aunt Polly's control.  Malden had just finished ""The Hanging Tree"" with Gary Cooper, and there is irony in that the character in this movie is almost completely opposite that of the role he had just played.  Veteran Disney child star Kevin Corcoran plays mischievous orphan Jimmy Bean, who helps Mr. Pendegast, the town hermit, break out of his self-imposed shell.  Adolphe Menjou played Mr. Pendegast in the last movie role of his 150 movie career.  James Drury of television's ""The Virginian"" plays George Dodd, who is the love interest of Nancy Furman, Aunt Polly's maid, and Aunt Polly does not approve of the relationship.  Nancy Olson was also in a number of other Disney movies, including ""The Absent Minded Professor"" and ""Son of Flubber,"" with an uncredited cameo in 1997's ""Flubber.""This movie benefits from an excellent transfer to DVD and a move to a widescreen format.  I recommend purchasing this movie in this format if you currently have the movie only on VHS or have yet to purchase it.  There are additional extras that viewers with interest in the era and how the movie was made may find enjoyable.The movie drives its point home at the end, when Pollyanna is depressed following an accident and needs support herself.  The support she receives from the townspeople is a testament to the power of Pollyanna's selfless love, which touches the hearts not only of the fictional town, but those of viewers.This heartwarming movie is more than an excellent family film, more than an excellent Hayley Mills film and more than an excellent period movie; it is a great Disney movie at an artistic peak of the Walt Disney Company.",5,A Disney and Hayley Mills Great,1110672000,"03 13, 2005",2005,4194,"['Pollyanna', 'was', 'first', 'opinion', 'best', 'first', 'six', 'movies', 'Hayley', 'Mills', 'starred', 'Disney', 'others', 'being', 'Parent', 'Trap', '1961', 'Search', 'Castaways', '1962', 'Summer', 'Magic', '1963', 'Moon-Spinners', '1964', 'Darn', 'Cat', '1965', 'six', 'movies', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'family', 'fare', 'movie', 'depth', 'complexity', 'approached', 'only', 'Summer', 'Magic', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'wide-eyed', 'Pollyanna', 'witness', 'power', 'Aunt', 'Polly', 'town', 'named', 'Harrington', 'family', 'Pollyanna', 'also', 'quickly', 'learn', 'are', 'numerous', 'stories', 'town', 'movie', 'piece', 'piece', 'ultimately', 'giving', 'power', 'different', ""aunt's.This"", 'movie', 'place', 'early', 'part', 'twentieth', 'century', 'Aunt', 'Polly', 'genteel', 'Victorian', 'behavior', 'even', 'little', 'stereotypical', 'feel', 'often', 'attribute', 'era', 'one', 'point', 'Aunt', 'Polly', 'term', 'noblesse', 'oblige', 'how', 'wealthy', 'people', 'often', 'considered', 'obligation', 'society', 'clothing', 'sets', 'appear', 'be', 'realistic', 'enhancing', 'period', 'believability', 'quality', 'costumes', 'sets', 'one', 'remarkable', 'features', 'movie.The', 'background', 'stories', 'provide', 'field', 'torment', 'pain', 'enhance', 'Pollyanna', 'consistently', 'glad', 'outlook', 'world', 'Pollyanna', 'attitude', 'life', 'changes', 'lives', 'everyone', 'Harrington', 'one', 'person', 'time', 'Even', 'better', 'Pollyanna', 'okay', 'feel', 'good', 'make', 'others', 'feel', 'good', 'Even', 'more', 'importantly', 'people', 'feel', 'heart', 'many', 'cases', 'love', 'Hayley', 'Mills', 'was', 'so', 'skilled', 'role', 'was', 'awarded', 'special', 'Academy', 'Award', 'most', 'outstanding', 'juvenile', 'performance', '1960', 'last', 'such', 'given.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'movie', 'can', 'truly', 'be', 'said', 'be', 'all-star', 'Jane', 'Wyman', 'who', 'was', 'nearing', 'end', 'career', 'spanning', 'fifty', 'years', 'Pollyanna', 'initially', 'grim', 'Aunt', 'Polly', 'who', 'eventually', 'should', 'do', 'things', 'not', 'obligation', 'rich', 'Agnes', 'Moorehead', 'veteran', 'more', '70', 'movies', 'recurring', 'character', 'popular', '60s', 'television', 'show', 'Bewitched', 'Mrs', 'Snow', 'grumpy', 'hypochondriac', 'who', 'one', 'foot', 'casket', 'actually', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'her.Karl', 'Malden', 'fire', 'brimstone', 'Reverend', 'Paul', 'Ford', 'who', 'keep', 'many', 'faithful', 'wide-eyed', 'Sunday', 'also', 'Aunt', 'Polly', 'control', 'Malden', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'Hanging', 'Tree', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'irony', 'character', 'movie', 'almost', 'completely', 'opposite', 'role', 'had', 'just', 'played', 'Veteran', 'Disney', 'child', 'star', 'Kevin', 'Corcoran', 'mischievous', 'Jimmy', 'Bean', 'who', 'Mr.', 'Pendegast', 'town', 'hermit', 'break', 'self-imposed', 'shell', 'Adolphe', 'Menjou', 'played', 'Mr.', 'Pendegast', 'last', 'movie', 'role', '150', 'movie', 'career', 'James', 'Drury', 'television', 'Virginian', 'plays', 'George', 'Dodd', 'who', 'love', 'interest', 'Nancy', 'Furman', 'Aunt', 'Polly', 'maid', 'Aunt', 'Polly', 'not', 'approve', 'relationship', 'Nancy', 'Olson', 'was', 'also', 'number', 'other', 'Disney', 'movies', 'including', 'Absent', 'Minded', 'Professor', 'Son', 'Flubber', 'uncredited', 'cameo', '1997', 'Flubber', 'movie', 'benefits', 'excellent', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'move', 'widescreen', 'format', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'movie', 'format', 'currently', 'have', 'movie', 'only', 'VHS', 'have', 'yet', 'purchase', 'are', 'additional', 'extras', 'viewers', 'interest', 'era', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'may', 'find', 'enjoyable.The', 'movie', 'point', 'home', 'end', 'when', 'Pollyanna', 'depressed', 'following', 'accident', 'support', 'support', 'townspeople', 'testament', 'power', 'Pollyanna', 'selfless', 'love', 'hearts', 'not', 'only', 'fictional', 'town', 'viewers.This', 'heartwarming', 'movie', 'more', 'excellent', 'family', 'film', 'more', 'excellent', 'Hayley', 'Mills', 'film', 'more', 'excellent', 'period', 'movie', 'great', 'Disney', 'movie', 'artistic', 'peak', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Company']",Pollyanna VHS

411221,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,6304285396,Mark Baker,"[10, 22]","Pollyanna Whittier (Hayley Mills) has had a hard life.  Her parents have recently died, so the little girl is sent to live with her aunt Polly (Jane Wyman).Polly is the only surviving adult heir of the Harrington family.  As such, she is extremely rich.  But she also has the responsibility of running the town, named Harrington after her family.  With so many people depending on her, Polly has developed a pessimistic view on life.  She does things out of duty, not because she wants to do them.Into this world comes Pollyanna.  She is an optimist.  In fact, her family invented the ""Glad Game.""  When Pollyanna starts to be overwhelmed by bad things, she looks for something to be glad about no matter the circumstances.While Pollyanna's attitude has no effect on her aunt, it slowly begins to work on the town of Harrington.  But can Pollyanna's attitude change the one person in town who needs it most?I've been interested to see this movie for years.  It was filmed in my hometown, and I've driven by Aunt Polly's house I don't know how many times.  I finally got a chance to see it, and I'm glad.The movie is entertaining.  Maybe because I'm an adult, I got drawn into the politics in the town.  I was actually more interested in that then in watching Pollyanna work her charm on the grumps in town.The biggest problem with the movie is the pacing.  There are several repetitive scenes and scenes that would be cut for today's short attention span audiences.  Maybe if I had seen this as a kid I wouldn't mind, but as an adult, I found myself watching the clock at times to see how much longer the movie would run.Add to that the climax.  Instead of being properly developed, the movie ends abruptly.  I want to know what happened next.  Still, I had come to care for the characters, so I was emotionally affected by the ending.This movie is well worth watching once.

The director wrote the screenplay and had his way in everything and it shows.  Amazingly, the only interference from Walt was when he refused to allow any editing.  He loved the first cut so much that he couldn't stand to see any of it end up in the trash.  When was the last time you heard of a director's cut that would have been shorter than the studio cut?  Well, Walt was right.  We love every second of it and are only sad that it is not longer.  Oh that Disney would ditch CGI and computer animation and get back to making movies like this.  It is not impossible.  The BBC still manages it occassionally.  If our children were brought up on movies like this, they would be smarter, kinder, and quieter.

The picture and sound quality are amazing - so much better than the copy I have taped off TV from the late 80s.  The film is presented in widescreen but I've realized not a lot goes on on the sides of the picture in this particular movie; in other words, you really don't get much more action with widescreen than you would have with the pan & scan video or a TV-taped version.  However, this IS the film as the director intended it, and I think that's great.  This DVD (actually two DVDs!) contains so much great stuff, I can't even list it all here.  Let's just say amazon.com's list doesn't even get INTO what's on this DVD.  There are so many little treasures, and something for everyone - Disney fanatics, Hayley Mills fans, movie freaks, and (naturally!) Pollyanna fans.  My favorite features so far are the featurette on Pollyanna advertising, the one about how they restored the picture/film to make the colors how they should have been, and the one about Pollyanna merchandise.  Plus, the audio commentary by Hayley Mills and the (now late) David Swift is insightful and interesting.  I would also recommend the ""Parent Trap"" DVD for more of the same fun.  The Disney co. really went all out for these DVDs and they are well worth the money.  And if you've never seen the movie - it's an adorable family flick that I've loved for nearly 14 years.

The story, by Eleanor S. Porter, is, of course, about a poor orphan who comes to live with her up tight aunt in a stiff community of social climbers.  But through her sheer will and pleasantness, Pollyana overcomes even the most hardened cynic in the town.  It's a wonderful story and a great cast.  But the transfer continues to look dated.  Colors are often weak or pasty.  There are quite a few scenes that appear soft or slightly out of focus.  Pixelization and edge enhancement intrude in the background information, making the overall visual experience pretty run of the mill.  The audio is dated but well represented.  As with other discs in the &quot;Vault Disney&quot; series, &quot;Pollyana&quot; is given a royal treatment with enough extra features for two movies.

She enjoys the moment and this irritates people until they learn that the way she sees life really does bring happiness to their own existence on the planet.Adopted by her Aunt, she learns to live a new life after loosing her missionary parents in the British West Indies. Her father seems to have taught her how to deal with life and she often quotes something wonderful he has said. Of course, the grownups in the story don't understand her at all and tell her not to repeat the wisdom of her father. That in fact showed how out of touch they are with a child's delicate feelings.Unshaken, Pollyanna is happy just to have her own room and still desires to see life in a positive way. She also gives everyone more than one chance to see the beauty in life. She becomes a ray of sunshine and a breath of fresh air in a stuffy town filled with grumpy lives. Yet, even Pollyanna gives up for a few minutes, then realizes what a responsibility she has to bring happiness to the lives of those she has learned to love.Almost single handedly, she rallies the entire town to a good cause and helps to raise money for a new orphanage. Like a little angel, she touches each life she meets with a sweet innocence and creative flair.Just as Pollyanna has changed so many lives for the better, her life takes a drastic turn for the worse. Even in the face of tragedy, what she does achieve is actually quite miraculous. The ending is spectacular and shows how love can really change the world you live in.

Don't know if it's because I had a crush on Hayley Mills when we were both young or whether I just liked the idea of an entire town changing its demeanor for the better because of a young girl. The storyline is somewhat predictable but well executed, the acting is superb and is not overdone and Hayley was especially wonderful along with Jane Wyman. Actually I think the entire cast did an outstanding job. If you are thinking of buying this movie you probably already know the plot so I say just buy it. It's one of the few movies that I like enough to watch every year especially during the holidays for that feel good experience.This set has one of the better disc two renditions. Seeing how they made the movie was more interesting than most I have viewed. I think it is at least worth a peek.As with most Disney products, the packaging was excellent though it was thicker (double side opening) than needed to be and takes up more shelf space. The clasp locked, single front opening with individual flip disc holder and stationary disc holder inside is a much better design.
