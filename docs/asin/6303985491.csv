Sitting on death row, he swears revenge against his former partners in crime, including his sleazoid lawyer who got him put away in the first place. Benton is executed the next day. His body is sold to a scientist who inadvertently brings him back to life during an experiment. Not only that, but Benton is now an indestructible maniac, impervious to bullets! Benton is also unable to speak, as his vocal cords have been destroyed by the 300,000 volts of electricity used on him. He kills the scientist and his assistant (played by the ever goofy Joe Flynn), then shambles forth to continue his rampage. This is a pretty good revenge flick. Both cops and innocent bystanders are wiped out for getting in his way! Benton stalks and eventually catches up with his ex-cronies, dispatching them in quick fashion. I was surprised at the body-count, seeing as this did come out in 1956.

394467,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6303985491,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 4]","Hollywood just couldn't get enough of clumsy, oafish, neo-Frankenstein monsters in the 1950s, as this movie demonstrates quite well. Lon Chaney, Jr., looking like a cross between Babe Ruth and Walter Matthau, plays Charles ""Butcher"" Benton, a death row inmate who swears revenge on his partners in crime for turning states' evidence and helping earn him a date with the gas chamber. I'm not sure why they call him the Butcher, though; as far as we are told, all he did was help hold up an armored car, steal 600 grand, and hide it where no one, especially his partners, would ever find it - looking back, the whole hiding all the money thing may have a lot to do with his partners' selling him out to the cops, but you just try explaining that to Butcher yourself. One must assume he killed someone during the heist - either that, or he was a meat butcher before he turned to a life of crime. He swears he will kill the guys who ratted him out, a threat that his three former partners scoff at for the logical reason that the Butcher is a day away from being executed. What they don't know is that the Butcher has a plan; in a brilliant move, he allows himself to be killed, fully confident that, against all the odds in the world, some crazy doctor will bribe some morgue attendant into selling him his corpse, at which point the doctor will, in looking for a cure for cancer, accidentally bring the Butcher back to life with several hundred thousand volts of electricity and give him superhuman strength and a skin that even Ginzu knives cannot penetrate. This is exactly what happens. (Actually, the Butcher doesn't really make any plans to back up his seemingly hollow threats at all; he just gets lucky.)Granted a second lease on life, missing only the ability to speak due to the debilitating effect massive volts of electricity have on the human vocal cords, he decides it's about time to start earning that nickname he loves so dearly. While all of this is happening, a bland police detective named Dick Chasen (played rather woodenly by Max Showalter) remains committed to finding the stolen money and implicating the three spineless hoods who helped Butcher carry out the heist, although it is entirely possible that he is just using this as an excuse for him to begin putting the moves on the Butcher's old burlesque dancer girlfriend. Eventually, all of these characters and plot points come together for as satisfying an end as you might expect (this is a criticism, not a note of praise), but in the meantime Lon Chaney Jr. stumbles around like a drunk man with one wooden leg, occasionally scrunching his face up into what is supposed to be a fierce expression as the camera zooms in for a close-up. As far as urban Frankenstein-esque movies go, Indestructible Man isn't that bad; the decision to have Chaney utter no lines whatsoever after his execution and resurrection seems like a wise move, but then you think about how many additional lines this threw Max Showalter's way. Realizing you can't win either way, you immediately begin to forget everything about this rather dull sort-of-monster movie.",3,Yet another 1950s madman resurrected by wacky scientists,1054684800,"06 4, 2003",2003,3118,"['Hollywood', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'clumsy', 'oafish', 'neo-Frankenstein', 'monsters', '1950s', 'movie', 'quite', 'well', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr.', 'looking', 'cross', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'Charles', 'Butcher', 'Benton', 'death', 'row', 'inmate', 'who', 'revenge', 'partners', 'crime', 'turning', 'states', 'evidence', 'helping', 'earn', 'date', 'gas', 'chamber', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'call', 'Butcher', 'though', 'as', 'far', 'are', 'told', 'did', 'was', 'help', 'hold', 'up', 'armored', 'car', 'steal', '600', 'grand', 'hide', 'where', 'one', 'especially', 'partners', 'would', 'ever', 'find', 'looking', 'back', 'whole', 'hiding', 'money', 'thing', 'may', 'have', 'lot', 'do', 'partners', 'selling', 'cops', 'just', 'try', 'explaining', 'Butcher', 'must', 'assume', 'killed', 'someone', 'heist', 'was', 'meat', 'butcher', 'turned', 'life', 'crime', 'will', 'kill', 'guys', 'who', 'ratted', 'out', 'threat', 'three', 'former', 'partners', 'scoff', 'logical', 'reason', 'Butcher', 'day', 'away', 'being', 'executed', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Butcher', 'plan', 'brilliant', 'move', 'be', 'killed', 'fully', 'confident', 'odds', 'world', 'crazy', 'doctor', 'will', 'bribe', 'morgue', 'attendant', 'selling', 'corpse', 'point', 'doctor', 'will', 'looking', 'cure', 'cancer', 'accidentally', 'bring', 'Butcher', 'back', 'life', 'several', 'hundred', 'thousand', 'volts', 'electricity', 'give', 'superhuman', 'strength', 'skin', 'even', 'Ginzu', 'knives', 'can', 'not', 'penetrate', 'exactly', 'what', 'Actually', 'Butcher', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'plans', 'back', 'up', 'seemingly', 'hollow', 'threats', 'just', 'lucky', 'Granted', 'second', 'lease', 'life', 'missing', 'only', 'ability', 'speak', 'due', 'debilitating', 'effect', 'massive', 'volts', 'electricity', 'have', 'human', 'vocal', 'cords', 'time', 'start', 'earning', 'nickname', 'so', 'dearly', 'happening', 'bland', 'police', 'detective', 'named', 'Dick', 'Chasen', 'played', 'rather', 'woodenly', 'Max', 'Showalter', 'committed', 'finding', 'stolen', 'money', 'implicating', 'three', 'spineless', 'hoods', 'who', 'helped', 'Butcher', 'carry', 'out', 'heist', 'entirely', 'possible', 'just', 'using', 'excuse', 'begin', 'putting', 'moves', 'Butcher', 'old', 'burlesque', 'dancer', 'girlfriend', 'Eventually', 'characters', 'plot', 'points', 'come', 'together', 'satisfying', 'end', 'might', 'expect', 'criticism', 'not', 'note', 'praise', 'meantime', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr.', 'drunk', 'man', 'one', 'wooden', 'leg', 'occasionally', 'scrunching', 'face', 'up', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'fierce', 'expression', 'camera', 'close-up', 'As', 'far', 'urban', 'Frankenstein-esque', 'movies', 'go', 'Indestructible', 'Man', ""n't"", 'bad', 'decision', 'have', 'Chaney', 'utter', 'lines', 'whatsoever', 'execution', 'resurrection', 'wise', 'move', 'then', 'think', 'how', 'many', 'additional', 'lines', 'threw', 'Max', 'Showalter', 'way', 'Realizing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'way', 'immediately', 'begin', 'forget', 'everything', 'rather', 'dull', 'sort-of-monster', 'movie']",Indestructible Man VHS
394468,A3OV2QDCLAV9H3,6303985491,El Jimbo,"[0, 2]","Somebody at amazon decided to lump all the reviews into one bundle, so most of these reviews appear to be about the version that the MST3K TV show used.  The problem with MST3K is, although the comments may be funny, you don't get the full effect because you are watching someone else's opinion of what the better of funnier parts are.This is a review of the uncut movie (and also the t-shirt) that comes in the package advertised as DVDTee.First the movie:  It's a gas, even without the comments from the MST3K peanut gallery.  Oh, how Chaney had fallen by this time.  He apparently was looking for anything to pay the bills by the time this movie came out.  With the exception of a brief setup in the beginning to explain why his character will be doing what he does later, Chaney has no dialogue.  He is reduced to grunts and lumbering undeterred after his goal.Briefly, ""Butcher"" Benton (Chaney) is scheduled to die in the electric chair for a robbery/murder by him and several accomplices.  Benton feels he has been double-crossed and swears revenge.  But he is successfully executed so it seems those words are hollow.  But a mad scientist arranges to have the body after it is executed, and through some electrical hoohah and scientific fiddle faddle, the scientist unintentionally brings Benton back to life.Yeah, it's a variation of Frankenstein, with the added story line of the ""Frankenstein monster"" going a killing rampage out of revenge.  The most laughable part is the over the action dialogue by the police officer giving us the story as in flashback.  The guy sounds as stilted as anything that Jack ""Sgt Friday"" Webb ever did on his TV show ""Dragnet"".The movie gets two stars because at least I didn't turn it off.  There is an added bonus of a T-shirt.  Like the rest of the t-shirts  in this DVDtee series, you get a vintage poster of the movie printed on a tee.

394469,A1Q1PP3Z4QDUQM,6303985491,Farffleblex Plaffington,"[1, 4]","Jack Pollexfen's second and last directorial effort, The Indestructible Man, is an unfortunate, snooze-inducing mess.  The basic ideas are very promising.  It combines a funky film-noir with a modern (for 1956) update on the Frankenstein story, with one of my favorite actors, Lon Chaney, Jr. as the ""monster"", and it's the first film I know of to use the basic plot later employed for Wes Craven's Shocker (1989).  Yet, despite this only being about 70 minutes long, I started watching about two hours before my normal bedtime and I could barely stay awake until the end.  I know I zoned out a couple times but hardly felt compelled to rewind the disc and make sure I didn't miss anything.What really kills the film is the writing, which is surprising, because Pollexfen's principal vocation throughout his career was as a writer.  But for some reason, he didn't write this.  Two people I've never heard of did the job instead--Vy Russell and Sue Bradford.  At times, the writing resembles Ed Wood, especially in the narration, which was a bad idea.  Not that the direction is much to speak of, but aside from letting some bad, out of focus cinematography slide by, it's pretty competent in a poverty-row sort of way (I happen to like many of the poverty row pictures a lot).Chaney doesn't get to do enough here, and the plot demands that he cannot speak for most of the film.  Max Showalter, the detective/narrator, and to a lesser extent Marian Carr are the stars.  Showalter's okay, and Carr is attractive and decent enough, but I would have rather had more Chaney.  In the bad directorial decision department, there are a few times that Pollexfen has Chaney make Lugosi-Dracula-like googly eyes while he moves towards the camera.  It's a bad idea both because it's very cheesy in a bad way and it's responsible for a lot of the out of focus stuff.  I don't know if they didn't have a focus puller or if he had already fallen asleep.In the middle, I also started to lose track of the various victims.  They all kinda looked the same, there wasn't much character development, and the scenes leading up to their demises were drawn out and bland.  Once the victim entered the scene, they weren't in it for very long.  On the other hand, I did mention that I zoned out a few times.However, there are some interesting features besides the good core ideas. One is that there is some structural resemblance, especially during the end, to Orson Welles' Touch of Evil, believe it or not, and that came out in 1958--two years after this. There is also a bit of structural resemblance in the end of Blacula (1972). Not that this film was influential. The resemblance was probably coincidental, and for all I know, Indestructible Man stole some of this stuff from other sources, but just maybe . . . and it's still interesting to witness, anyway.I'm mostly complaining in this review, but it's not that this is a completely awful film.  It's certainly worth seeing if you're a Chaney fan, a film-noir fan or a Frankenstein film fan.  Just don't expect too much, and preferably watch it when you're wide awake.",2,Snoozy Film-Noir Frankenstein-Shocker,1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,3101,"['Jack', 'Pollexfen', 'second', 'last', 'directorial', 'effort', 'Indestructible', 'Man', 'unfortunate', 'snooze-inducing', 'mess', 'basic', 'ideas', 'are', 'very', 'promising', 'funky', 'film-noir', 'modern', '1956', 'update', 'Frankenstein', 'story', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr.', 'monster', 'first', 'film', 'know', 'use', 'basic', 'plot', 'later', 'employed', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Shocker', '1989', 'only', 'being', '70', 'minutes', 'long', 'started', 'watching', 'two', 'hours', 'normal', 'bedtime', 'could', 'barely', 'stay', 'awake', 'end', 'know', 'zoned', 'out', 'couple', 'times', 'hardly', 'felt', 'compelled', 'rewind', 'disc', 'make', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'anything.What', 'really', 'film', 'writing', 'surprising', 'Pollexfen', 'principal', 'vocation', 'career', 'was', 'writer', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'Two', 'people', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'did', 'job', 'instead', 'Vy', 'Russell', 'Sue', 'Bradford', 'times', 'writing', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'especially', 'narration', 'was', 'bad', 'idea', 'Not', 'direction', 'much', 'speak', 'aside', 'letting', 'bad', 'focus', 'cinematography', 'slide', 'pretty', 'competent', 'poverty-row', 'sort', 'way', 'happen', 'like', 'many', 'poverty', 'row', 'lot', '.Chaney', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', 'enough', 'here', 'plot', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'most', 'film', 'Max', 'Showalter', 'detective/narrator', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Marian', 'Carr', 'are', 'stars', 'Showalter', 'okay', 'Carr', 'attractive', 'decent', 'enough', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'had', 'more', 'Chaney', 'bad', 'directorial', 'decision', 'department', 'are', 'few', 'times', 'Pollexfen', 'Chaney', 'make', 'Lugosi-Dracula-like', 'googly', 'eyes', 'camera', 'bad', 'idea', 'very', 'cheesy', 'bad', 'way', 'responsible', 'lot', 'out', 'focus', 'stuff', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'focus', 'puller', 'had', 'already', 'fallen', 'middle', 'also', 'started', 'lose', 'track', 'various', 'victims', 'kinda', 'looked', 'same', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'character', 'development', 'scenes', 'leading', 'up', 'demises', 'were', 'drawn', 'out', 'bland', 'victim', 'entered', 'scene', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'long', 'other', 'hand', 'did', 'mention', 'zoned', 'out', 'few', 'times.However', 'are', 'interesting', 'features', 'good', 'core', 'ideas', 'One', 'structural', 'resemblance', 'especially', 'end', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Touch', 'Evil', 'believe', 'not', 'came', 'out', '1958', 'two', 'years', 'also', 'bit', 'structural', 'resemblance', 'end', 'Blacula', '1972', 'Not', 'film', 'was', 'influential', 'resemblance', 'was', 'probably', 'coincidental', 'know', 'Indestructible', 'Man', 'stole', 'stuff', 'other', 'sources', 'just', 'maybe', 'still', 'interesting', 'witness', 'anyway.I', ""'m"", 'mostly', 'complaining', 'review', 'not', 'completely', 'awful', 'film', 'certainly', 'worth', 'seeing', ""'re"", 'Chaney', 'fan', 'film-noir', 'fan', 'Frankenstein', 'film', 'fan', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'preferably', 'watch', 'when', ""'re"", 'wide', 'awake']",Indestructible Man VHS

394471,A3NJXCGCLNU808,6303985491,Jeff Smith,"[1, 1]","In the 1950s, there were tons of sci-fi/horror films. A few of them were outstanding (The Day the Earth Stood Still, Creature From the Black Lagoon), and some stinkers (Plan 9 From Outer Space, Bride of the Monster), but the majority of them were solid, middle-of-the-road flicks. Indestructible Man falls in this category.The film was no challenge for Chaney from an acting standpoint. He only had a few lines at the start of the film before he was rendered mute after being brought back to life in an experiment. However, he did come through by some of his facial expressions that told the viewer what he was thinking. For instance, he arrives at the office of one of his victims to find it empty. He appears frustrated, but then, he hears the elevator coming, and a satisfied smirk comes over his face.The film was definitely low budget, and Chaney was probably doing it for a payday, but it does have some good moments. The scenes in the Los Angeles sewer were suspenseful, and in some of the killings, Chaney's body language and his brutality lived up to his character's nickname of &quot;The Butcher.&quot;It is a shame that Chaney enjoyed true stardom for only a few years with Universal in the 1940s as he played nearly every movie monster they had. He was then cast aside in character roles and movies such as this. He was a much better actor, and his talents were wasted. But, like a true professional, he took his medicine and continued to work hard, making several movies throughout his career.Indestructible Man is not for every one, but if you are a Chaney fan and love these types of movies from the 1950s, then it is a worthy addition to your collection.",3,A solid 1950s sci-fi/horror film,978912000,"01 8, 2001",2001,1670,"['1950s', 'were', 'tons', 'sci-fi/horror', 'films', 'few', 'were', 'outstanding', 'Day', 'Earth', 'Stood', 'Still', 'Creature', 'Black', 'Lagoon', 'stinkers', 'Plan', '9', 'From', 'Outer', 'Space', 'Bride', 'Monster', 'majority', 'were', 'solid', 'middle-of-the-road', 'flicks', 'Indestructible', 'Man', 'category.The', 'film', 'was', 'challenge', 'Chaney', 'acting', 'standpoint', 'only', 'had', 'few', 'lines', 'start', 'film', 'was', 'rendered', 'mute', 'being', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'experiment', 'However', 'did', 'come', 'facial', 'expressions', 'told', 'viewer', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', 'instance', 'office', 'one', 'victims', 'find', 'empty', 'frustrated', 'then', 'elevator', 'coming', 'satisfied', 'smirk', 'face.The', 'film', 'was', 'definitely', 'low', 'budget', 'Chaney', 'was', 'probably', 'doing', 'payday', 'have', 'good', 'moments', 'scenes', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'sewer', 'were', 'suspenseful', 'killings', 'Chaney', 'body', 'language', 'brutality', 'lived', 'up', 'character', 'nickname', 'quot', 'Butcher.', 'quot', 'shame', 'Chaney', 'enjoyed', 'true', 'stardom', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'Universal', '1940s', 'played', 'nearly', 'movie', 'monster', 'had', 'was', 'then', 'cast', 'aside', 'character', 'roles', 'movies', 'such', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'actor', 'talents', 'were', 'wasted', 'true', 'professional', 'took', 'medicine', 'continued', 'work', 'hard', 'making', 'several', 'movies', 'career.Indestructible', 'Man', 'not', 'one', 'are', 'Chaney', 'fan', 'love', 'types', 'movies', '1950s', 'then', 'worthy', 'addition', 'collection']",Indestructible Man VHS

394473,A1LTK2KT023CNY,6303985491,N. A. Parry,"[2, 3]","Stepping out of his father's shadow, Lon Chaney Jr. found initial fame and acclaim in 1940's films, 'Of Mice and Men' and 'One Million Years BC'. As a result, he was swiftly catapulted into Universal's top drawer, playing most  of their classic monsters of the time. Only as the poor, tortured Larry  Talbot (aka The Wolf Man) did Chaney ever find true success, and in the  mid-forties, his time as top-billed status was over. Then came many film  roles like this. In the thankless and mostly mute part of 'The Butcher',  Chaney is brought back from the dead with 'terrifying' power. He then kills  those responsible for his demise. And that's the plot.

An encouraged guy named Jack Pollexfen (not unlike Ed Wood) had an idea (not unlike Ed Wood) and cast a great actor from the past (not unlike Ed Wood). The difference is that this is a take on ""noir"", though without the finesse of those earlier films (sorta like Ed Wood). Production values, as in any independent film with a somewhat believable plot, are low. (""Blair Witch Project"", though innovative, was not much different). My idea is not to criticize it for its tackiness, but for its idea. The acting isn't that bad.  Marian Carr is actually quite effective as the only female lead. Casey Adams was good as he could be; made a big mark on TV in ""Green Acres""; it's almost a take on ""Dragnet"", the hit TV series at the time (though Adams has more life than Jack Webb ever did...). Then there's Lon Chaney, Jr., relegated to idiotic roles because Hollywood never knew what to do with him; with the studio collapse of the early 50's, no one remembered his touching performance as ""The Wolf Man"" (1941) or his most remarkable performance (as Lenny) in ""Of Mice and Men"" (1939, directed by Lewis Milestone). Whaddya do with a guy like this? Perhaps he knew that he was ""hard to cast"", but I beg anyone to say that his heart wasn't in it. Today's wave of independent film is suddenly recognized as a force to be reckoned with; budgets as they are, I think some of the ""lousy"" films of the 50's tried to do the same thing. They didn't have Miramax to back them...NO ONE, for that matter. Still, I was a part of the Drive-In crowd back then, and I still appreciate this kind of film fare. Even bad independent film should be respected, to a point. The really trashy films will be just that; small moments of ingenuity should be respected. I have the VHS version, and now the DVD. Both are of low quality, but I find both equally entertaining. This film has been written off as junk by the studios who've produced it. Despite the bad VHS/DVD transfers, the film held my interest.

Robert Shayne is a scientist with good intentions that accidentally creates a monster.  Classic TV fans will recall that Shayne played Lt. Henderson opposite George Reeves's Superman.  It gets better.  Joe Flynn, Captain Binghampton of ""McHale's Navy,"" is Shayne's owlish assistant.  Picture Igor in horn-rimmed glasses.  They steal the executed Butcher Benton (Lon Chaney), and juice him with 287,000 volts using Frankenstein-type lab equipment.  Butcher is resurrected and on the rampage.  The massive electric jolt made him indestructible, steel flesh and all.  Nothing can stop him.  Police Lt. Chasen (Casey Adams), a Joe Friday clone, investigates the robbery that led to Butcher's execution.  Chasen does a ""just the facts"" narration that only Jack Webb could love.  Chasen hangs around the burley-Q house, questioning one of the strippers, Eva.  He thinks she may have a clue to the still missing money.  He wants to pump her, but only for information.  Yeah, right.  Hot on the tail (oops! trail, I mean) Chasen invites Eva out for dinner.  In a Freudian moment, Eva tells Chasen, ""I don't even know your first name.""  Chasen slowly replies, ""It's...Dick.""  Butcher searches the seamy side of town for his victims.  The floppy dummies that he throws around are great examples of cheesy special effects.  The rest of the cast is as obscure as the dreary B&W photography.  Only the names were changed to protect the innocent.  Check out the old Rambler police cars.

Nollen,"[8, 8]","If you are a fan of low-budget horror and/or film noir, then you must see the struggling Lon Chaney, Jr., as the notorious Charles &quot;Butcher&quot; Benton!  By 1956, poor Lon was accepting just about anything he could, being tormented by many demons and having been typecast so severely.  (He did, however, also play several good character parts in non-horror Fifties A-films like HIGH NOON, NOT AS A STRANGER, A LION IS IN THE STREETS and THE DEFIANT ONES, something that neither Boris Karloff nor Bela Lugosi did during the 1950s--Karloff being busy with television and the stage, and Lugosi sinking into an endlessly painful morass.)  Here, Lon does a fine job with his limited dialogue and then has a heyday as the revived-from-the-dead mute who pummels and THROWS his victims to their deaths (in some of the most humorous killing scenes in horror-film history).  The scenes of Lon crawling around in the L.A. storm-drain system and the incredible ending in which the Butcher is cooked alive at a power plant (destroying a multi-million dollar complex while the police recover a fraction of that in gangster's loot) are highlights in this sometimes dreadful yet strangely compelling and nearly always entertaining Jack Pollexfen opus!

394478,A1WHDU7LN87PWY,6303985491,"Surfink ""Surfink""","[12, 12]","Indestructible Man is probably the most familiar, and beloved, of producer-director Jack Pollexfen's poverty-row epics (Neanderthal Man, Daughter of Dr. Jekyll, Atomic Brain). Pollexfen's name in the credits always means you're in no-budget-land. Another clue this time out is the preponderance of narration (indicating an absence of synch sound, of course). The movie gets what little rep it has from the casting of Lon Chaney as back-from-the-dead killer `The Butcher' Benton, although he actually looks rather thin and haggard here (he was no doubt drinking heavily at the time), and not very threatening at all. Or as the narrator says, ""like any normal person on his way to work."" Robert Shayne (Neanderthal Man, Inspector Henderson on Superman) makes a brief appearance as ""mad"" Professor Bradshaw (assisted by Joe ""Captain Binghamton"" Flynn) resuscitating The Butcher; bland Casey Adams/Max Showalter (Monster that Challenged the World, Niagara) is Lt. Dick Chasen the flatfoot hero; and Ross Elliott (Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, Monster on the Campus) plays a sleazy lawyer. The movie tries for trash appeal by making The Butcher's ex-girlfriend Eva (Marion Carr) a burlesque performer, but her sweet-and-innocent manner totally undercuts any bad-girl ambience that might have been generated. Overall the movie is a bit on the dull side, with a few laughs, and a modicum of bad-movie charm. Cinematography is by John L. (Jack) Russell (Hitchcock's Psycho; Thriller TV series), though you're unlikely to be impressed by the source print: it's fairly grainy, with a slightly soft, `dupey' look, and respectable if unremarkable grayscale, brightness, contrast, and shadow/highlight detail. There is also light-to-moderate speckling, scratching, and blemishing throughout, and the sound is merely OK, a bit on the muddy side at times. Kind of makes you wonder what exactly Roan ""restored."" (The box claims the movies to be ""digitally mastered and restored from original film elements."" ?!?). Not nearly as nice as some of their other releases (e.g. Svengali, Horror Hotel), if not disastrous either.The Amazing Transparent Man was cult director Edgar G. Ulmer's final American film and it pretty much feels like a last gasp (it's not nearly as much fun as Beyond the Time Barrier). The mostly no-name cast ranges from annoying (loud, abrasive Douglas Kennedy as safecracker Joey Faust) to cloying (Dr. Ulof [familiar character actor Ivan Triesault] and his daughter Maria). The script is an odd mix of gangster movie cliches, soap opera melodramatics, late 50s topicality (Cold War/espionage subplotting), and Weighty Issues thematics that never really goes anywhere. The laboratory set is quite poverty-stricken, and the invisibility effects, accomplished with traveling mattes, are only mildly diverting. Other special effects are of the pantomime-and-fishing-line variety; almost cheesy enough to be funny. Almost. Legendary makeup artist Jack P. Pierce's talents are completely wasted (it was one of his last movies), and, let's face it, Ulmer is way past prime here, with precious little onscreen to distinguish this from any contemporary Dick Cunha or Herbert L. Strock picture.At least the source print is better than that of Indestructible Man. It's actually quite decent, presented in anamorphic widescreen at approximately 1.85:1, with generally very good to excellent grayscale, sharpness, brightness, contrast, and highlight detail. The shadow detail looks a little blocked up at times, and there is some sporadic light speckling, blemishing, and scratching (mostly around reel changes), but overall the print's quite acceptable, especially considering the age and history of the film.Bottom line: neither movie is really indispensable to a 1950s SF collection, both being of interest mainly to bad movie diehards with fairly strong constitutions. The DVD package rates a solid three. The source prints, while nothing to write home about, are basically average to slightly above (especially The ATM), and far better than the crap you typically find on a Madacy or Brentwood disc. Unfortunately, there are no menus, trailers, or any other extras, though both movies are broken into chapters.

Chaney opens up the film with a nice and fairly extensive dialouge exchange vowing revenge on those who sent him up the river giving promise to another film in alignment with his more sucessful Man Made Monster.From that point on it was clear this was a paint by numbers job that only uses Chaney in what might be called an 'extensive cameo' role.  A haggerty Chaney lumbers his way thru the film, no line of dialouge save for the opening exchange, doing his monster on the rampage thing.  I never really bought the 'he was too drunk to remember his lines so they wrote him as a mute in all his films' theory, especially considering the fantastic job he does on the opening dialouge exchange here, but the remainder of this film makes me think there may have been some inkling of truth to it. or maybe there just wasn't enough of a paycheck in it to make alot of work remembering lines worth his while.There are other members of the cast with much more dialouge and screen time than Chaney and when Chaney is not onscreen, you may easily mistake this flick for a Z grade cop thriller fro mthe 50's.Overall, I'd say skip this one unless you're a Lon Chaney jr completeist.
