1632256,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B00BEIYRYM,Anthony L.,"[3, 4]","In light of it's mixed critical response and box office failure, I avoided THE FIFTH ESTATE for a long time. More fool me. Having seen the film with an open mind, I now have no idea why the film was viewed so negatively. Was it because critics did not agree with Assange as a person? Did they feel the film didn't give enough insight into Wikileaks? Did they have a problem with the pacing? I don't know.Right from the opening scene - a hugely ambitious montage of human knowledge through the ages, The Fifth Estate establishes itself as stylish and riveting.Benedict Cumberbatchhits the nail home as Julian Assange! His crazy Aussie cyber-punk bent on transparency and informational freedom is in many ways his most mature, compelling performance.Daniel Bruhlis the human centre of the film, giving a relatable, conflicted performance of depth and subtlety. The outstanding cast is rounded off by an excellent David Thewlis, Downton Abbey's Dan Stevens, future-Doctor Peter Capaldi, and an entertaining Laura Linney and Stanley Tucci. When the screenplay gets wonky, Condon's cast brings home the message like a hammer.Equally impressive is Tobias Schliessler's rich and vibrant neo-noir visuals. Coupled with the fantastic Carter Burwell's score, we have a film that is technically adept AND terrifically acted. Now we come to the screenplay, and this is where I have to disagree with the critics. It is tremendously hard to write a screenplay on WikiLeaks that has a satisfying conclusion, especially considering how the story of Assange and WikiLeaks is ongoing and actually rather anticlimactic. But Josh Singer managed to make his story satisfying and relevant...a feat I give the film credit for.CONS: Singer's screenplay, while structured well, just doesn't give us enough insight into Assange's incredible character other than through exposition. Who knows how great a film THE FIFTH ESTATE could be if Condon and Co. went all out with a dangerous, edgy look at WikiLeaks? At times the film feels like a globe-trotting adventure as characters hop from Brussels to Berlin to Iceland and Kenya without much breath in between. And as the REAL Assange has so succinctly pointed out, there is something to be desired in the accuracy department here.But in conclusion, I really enjoyed THE FIFTH ESTATE - much more than I anticipated. Benedict Cumberbatch gives an electric and outstanding performance, and is supported by an experienced and smart supporting cast. The film is technically adept, moving, and actually quite thought-provoking. I can safely recommend THE FIFTH ESTATE as flawed, but riveting entertainment. My rating: Four Estates out of Five. If this review is helpful in your decision (or not) to purchase this film, please give it a like.",4,"""Two people and a secret: the beginning of all conspiracy.""",1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,2758,"['light', 'mixed', 'critical', 'response', 'box', 'office', 'failure', 'avoided', 'THE', 'FIFTH', 'ESTATE', 'long', 'time', 'More', 'fool', 'Having', 'seen', 'film', 'open', 'mind', 'now', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'viewed', 'so', 'negatively', 'Was', 'critics', 'did', 'not', 'agree', 'Assange', 'person', 'Did', 'feel', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'enough', 'insight', 'Wikileaks', 'Did', 'have', 'problem', 'pacing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.Right', 'opening', 'scene', 'hugely', 'ambitious', 'montage', 'human', 'knowledge', 'ages', 'Fifth', 'Estate', 'stylish', 'riveting.Benedict', 'nail', 'home', 'Julian', 'Assange', 'crazy', 'Aussie', 'cyber-punk', 'bent', 'transparency', 'informational', 'freedom', 'many', 'ways', 'most', 'mature', 'compelling', 'performance.Daniel', 'Bruhlis', 'human', 'centre', 'film', 'giving', 'relatable', 'conflicted', 'performance', 'depth', 'subtlety', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'rounded', 'off', 'excellent', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'future-Doctor', 'Peter', 'Capaldi', 'entertaining', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'When', 'screenplay', 'wonky', 'Condon', 'cast', 'home', 'message', 'hammer.Equally', 'impressive', 'Tobias', 'Schliessler', 'rich', 'vibrant', 'neo-noir', 'visuals', 'Coupled', 'fantastic', 'Carter', 'Burwell', 'score', 'have', 'film', 'technically', 'adept', 'AND', 'terrifically', 'acted', 'Now', 'come', 'screenplay', 'where', 'have', 'disagree', 'critics', 'tremendously', 'hard', 'write', 'screenplay', 'WikiLeaks', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'especially', 'considering', 'how', 'story', 'Assange', 'WikiLeaks', 'ongoing', 'actually', 'rather', 'anticlimactic', 'Josh', 'Singer', 'managed', 'make', 'story', 'satisfying', 'relevant', 'feat', 'give', 'film', 'credit', 'for.CONS', 'Singer', 'screenplay', 'structured', 'well', 'just', ""n't"", 'give', 'enough', 'insight', 'Assange', 'incredible', 'character', 'other', 'exposition', 'Who', 'how', 'great', 'film', 'THE', 'FIFTH', 'ESTATE', 'could', 'be', 'Condon', 'Co.', 'went', 'out', 'dangerous', 'edgy', 'look', 'WikiLeaks', 'times', 'film', 'feels', 'globe-trotting', 'adventure', 'characters', 'hop', 'Brussels', 'Berlin', 'Iceland', 'Kenya', 'much', 'breath', 'REAL', 'Assange', 'so', 'succinctly', 'pointed', 'out', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'accuracy', 'department', 'here.But', 'conclusion', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'THE', 'FIFTH', 'ESTATE', 'much', 'more', 'anticipated', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'electric', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'supported', 'experienced', 'smart', 'supporting', 'cast', 'film', 'technically', 'adept', 'moving', 'actually', 'quite', 'thought-provoking', 'can', 'safely', 'recommend', 'THE', 'FIFTH', 'ESTATE', 'flawed', 'riveting', 'entertainment', 'rating', 'Four', 'Five', 'review', 'helpful', 'decision', 'not', 'purchase', 'film', 'please', 'give', 'like']",The Fifth Estate

Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[36, 44]","Everyone seems to be mad at this movie because everyone who talks about it comes to it with a strong opinion about Julian Assange, and they wanted the film to depict him as a savior or a monster. I didn't have those preconceptions and I enjoyed the film from the opening title sequence. That sequence depicts hands carving hieroglyphics in Ancient Egypt, illuminated manuscripts, the first printing press, newspapers, computers - the myriad ways humans communicate. It's a title sequence Frank Capra would love.I found ""The Fifth Estate"" intriguing, fun, and moving. Benedict Cumberbatch is very good as Assange. The movie wants you to be impressed by him at first, but slowly to see his feet of clay, and Cumberbatch does that job. Daniel Bruhl plays Daniel Domscheit Berg, Assange's partner. Bruhl expresses disappointed hero worship very well. Assange is invited to Berg's home for dinner, and he disrespects Berg's polite parents. That intimate, believable scene makes you hate Assange in a way that his secret-releasing shenanigans might not.""The Fifth Estate"" struggles, as all computer-related films do, to depict life on a computer. It creates a fake office with the sky as ceiling where Assange's ""volunteers"" work. Assange describes his submission process at Wikileaks and pages appear onscreen. These visual flourishes are fun.The movie is interesting and fast-moving but not very deep. There are very big questions at play here and ""The Fifth Estate"" does not engage them deeply. Laura Linney plays Sarah, an American agent whose contact, Tarek, is endangered by Assange's revelations. There is some tension as Tarek flees Libya. Will he get out before Assange outs him, or will he and his family be captured and perhaps tortured by their oppressive government?Perhaps if ""The Fifth Estate"" had been more art than docudrama it could have gone deeper. Imagine a conversation between Sarah and Assange. One could argue for the importance, both strategic and humanitarian, of state secrets, and the other could argue against. Other questions - aren't secrets inevitable? Accept it: there is stuff you are simply never going to know.And, in the end, what difference did Assange make? The US is still in Afghanistan. Guantanamo still operates. People will pay more attention to Miley Cyrus twerking than to documents about torture in a Third World nation.

Played with narcissistic grace by Benedict Cumberbatch - in one of his best film roles to days - Julian Assange comes across as both obsessive and righteous, impossible to live with yet possessed of firm convictions, haunted by his past yet dedicated to improving the future.  His relationship with Daniel Berg (Daniel Bruhl) is a combustible one; Assange doesn't want his partner around yet can't seem to operate without him.  Eventually the two of them break up for good, and Assange is quite literally hoist by his own hubristic petard.  Structurally speaking. Bill Condon's film is particularly flashy - full of rapid cuts and awkward zooms.  Sometimes it becomes rather irritating in its attempt to stress the central theme; despite Assange's assertions to the contrary, Wikileaks was not a worldwide organization but a two-person operation.  The repeated shots of office desks, peopled by clones of Assange, emphasize the protagonist's ambitious, if somewhat unrealistic, dreams.  Eventually the flashiness gets in the way of the film's resolution, especially at the end, when the shots of burning books and campfires seem especially unnecessary, and Nick Davies' (David Thewlis') concluding speech is nothing short of tendentious.

At this particular point in time, it's difficult to predict what any given person will say when asked which character Benedict Cumberbatch is most well-known for portraying.  The clear frontrunner would have to be as Sherlock Holmes on the BBC/PPS series, Sherlock.  Of course, Star Trek fans might take great offense with that assessment since Cumberbatch is now the face of the beloved villain, Khan Noonien Singh - featured in last summer's blockbuster, Star Trek: Into Darkness.  Over the years, he's also portrayed Stephen Hawking in the TV film, Hawking, lent his voice to The Hobbit franchise, and also continues to dazzle in nearly all forms of entertainment. It's entirely possible that if his trend continues, he could wind up being the biggest actor - not just in Hollywood, but in the entire world.  In his newest film, Cumberbatch portrays the WikiLeaks mastermind, Julian Assange, in The Fifth Estate.Bill Condon (The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 & 2) directs The Fifth Estate, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as WikiLeaks founder and activist, Julian Assange.  With mutual interest in online activism, Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Br&uuml;hl) befriends Assange and together the two begin working on a website devoted to releasing unfiltered information that they believe the general public has a right to know.  At the same time, the website is also designed to protect the source of the information.  These anonymous sources, called whistleblowers, share their information without the fear of jail or consequence. For years, WikiLeaks goes about their business, releasing semi-critical information - until they are submitted a story that will rock the United States government and the rest of the world.  Laura Linney, Stanley Tucci, Anthony Mackie, David Thewlis, and Alicia Vikander also star in supporting roles.In a Social Network sort of way, The Fifth Estate chronicles the meeting between Julian Assange and Daniel Domscheit-Berg, which eventually turns out to be quite the combative, volatile partnership - also known as the foundation of WikiLeaks.  Eventually, their continuous work together leads and builds up to what we now call ""Cablegate,"" which was a series of document leaks that took place over the span of nearly a year and a half from February 2010 into September 2011.  If you followed the story or even vaguely remember the constant, almost never-ending news cycle, then you probably remember how big of a deal it was at the time.  The leak of these documents sent the United States government, along with several other news organizations and foreign governments into a nervous frenzy - and is still having repercussions today.  However, the magnitude of the situation is hardly captured in this two hour film.  In fact, by the conclusion of this film - it's nearly impossible to find any amount of entertainment whatsoever.Unfortunately, the characters simply never hit home in this film, often coming off dry and bland as they feed views far too much information in this delegating story, which horribly fails to sell them as the future's ""Woodward and Buernstein (check out All the President's Men).""  While it's nearly impossible to look at Benedict Cumberbatch the same way with white hair, he is about the only thing that stops this film from falling completely on its face.  His deliveries are masterful and although you most likely need a decent amount of background on Julian Assange before you'll understand this biopic, Cumberbatch pulls off the role of a maniacal puppet master in a commendable, breathtaking fashion.  His character's intentions appear to be noble in the beginning, acting as some sort of anonymous online freedom fighter - but as the film progresses, he's painted as someone that goes rogue and well - crazy.  Obviously, the manner in which this film is written is meant to depict him a self-proclaimed revolutionary, but in his own mind, he doesn't fully grasp the consequences of his actions.  In fact, it's hard to see what he hopes to positively accomplish in the first place.Benedict Cumberbatch and Daniel Br&uuml;hl present an interesting partnership from their first initial scene together, and it quickly becomes obvious that Cumberbatch will dominant their scenes, yet Br&uuml;hl, portraying Daniel Domscheit-Berg, still holds his own.  Having recently starred (successfully) in the auto racing film, Rush, Br&uuml;hl leaves another positive impression, even though his role in this film is reduced to that of a boring, simple-minded follower.  His character believes in the WikiLeaks cause, but eventually sees this media ""monster"" that he's help build snowball into something he can no longer control.  Sadly, this character is used like a punching bag and basically disregarded when he's lost his ambition for the organization's (i.e. Assange's) direction.  In a film that lacks a clear cut message and direction, it is easily recognizable that Domscheit-Berg is supposed to act as a moral ""line"" that shouldn't be crossed.  Once Julian Assange goes too far, Domscheit-Berg is thrust into action and his mission as the ""good guy"" is to stop Assange.This film operates under the premise, ""give a man a mask and he will tell the truth,"" which makes sense when these characters attempt to share their vision of the world.  Sadly, The Fifth Estate (which has its named explained in the film) does little to stimulate the eyes, ears, or mind - basically making this film a complete waste of time.  For me, being a media junky, the film is historically interesting - but full of bias opinion and judgments.  I would encourage anyone reading this to do your own research after viewing this troublesome film and come to your own conclusions about the events that took place.  There's no black and white answer to whether this film dignifies a view.  However, if you like current events and follow the daily news - this film might be worth a desperate, desperate shot for an at home view.  Even major fans of Benedict Cumberbatch should be weary and proceed with caution before giving this film any attention.  The bottom line is this subject matter makes for bad entertainment, no matter where your opinion lies.GRADE: D+FNDNreview.com",1,"Benedict Cumberbatch stars in the troubled WikiLeaks biopic, 'The

Without financing they create a platform that allows whistle-blowers to anonymously leak covert data, shining a light on the dark recesses of government secrets and corporate crimes. Soon, they are breaking more hard news than the world's most legendary media organizations combined. But when Assange and Berg gain access to the biggest trove of confidential intelligence documents in U.S. history, they battle each other and a defining question of our time: what are the costs of keeping secrets in a free society-and what are the costs of exposing them?  Perhaps the better way to survey the content is to quote a passage Assange states: `Man is least himself when he talks with his own person. But if you give him a mask, he will tell you the truth. Two people, and a secret: the beginning of all conspiracies. More people, and, more secrets. But if we could find one moral man, one whistle-blower. Someone willing to expose those secrets, that man can topple the most powerful and most repressive of regimes.'No matter how the viewer perceives Assange, this film provides information in an entertaining and enlightening manner about one of the most talked about scandals of this century - thus far.... The performances by the entire cast are exemplary. Grady Harp, January 14",4,`Courage is contagious.

Because this R-rated, dramatized account of WikiLeaks is from the perspective of his former collaborator Daniel Berg, I found no reason to change my mind. In May, 2013, I reviewed a documentary on the same topic, ""We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks"" but it didn't have the luxury of a spooky Benedict Cumberbatch doing a chilly portrayal of Assange.Depending on your point of view, this audacious hacker and his army of anonymous volunteers exposed states' secrets and confidential information that jeopardized agents and shocked the world, therefore he is either a hero or a villain.Watch:* Benedict Cumberbatch (""Sherlock"") is Julian Assange, a fellow who keeps offering different reasons why his hair is white. In my opinion, this thorny fellow may have a touch of Aspergers.* Daniel Br&uuml;hl (""Rush"") is Daniel Berg, an acolyte and eventually a skeptic who believes in Assange's original premise of total transparency for governments.* David Thewlis (""War Horse"") is Nick Davies with The Guardian. He speaks for all of us when he questions the morality of the press exposing undercover agents and their families to reprisals.* Peter Capaldi (""In the Loop"") is the voice for print journalism, he expresses the clash between ethics and the need for a profit.* Dan Stevens (""Downton Abbey"") is another member of the press. His admiration for Assange comes into question.* Anthony Mackie (""Runner Runner"") is another confounded U.S. official. The sheer numbers of WikiLeaks' Internet activity boggles his brain.This one went up in my estimation when I learned that Assange HATES it! (He is, as of this writing (October, 2013), still hiding in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London.I didn't particularly like the script, it was too contrived and could have been far more thought provoking, but Cumberbatch gave me the willies and Laura Linney along with Stanley Tucci added class to the mix!Amazon will notify me when the DVD is available.

""The Fifth Estate"" gives us a look at the man and his reasoning for doing what he did. Many believe it was a dangerous thing for Assange to do and others believe that these secrets should have always been released but governments feel that hiding the ""truth"" is in the best interest of the general public.Josh Singer's (Fringe, The West Wing) adaption of the two books the film is based on ""Inside WikiLeaks: My Time with Julian Assange at the World's Most Dangerous Website"" and ""WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy"" was amazingly detailed. The depth and intricacies of the characters and how they developed were amazingly intertwined and complex yet interesting to the end.Another hats off again to Benedict Cumberbatch (Star Trek, Sherlock) who portrays Julian with such gusto and belief that it's hard to feel anything but envy for this determined, smart, real sharp person - genius - who can technologically beat technology. Benedict does such an amazing job with his dialogue, appearance and intensity it makes all the other characters in the film seem to gravitate toward him.Daniel Bruhl (The Bourne Ultimatum, Inglorious Bastards) plays another up and coming genius who is confounded by Benedict accuracy, detail and intelligence that ultimately he has the moral dilemma of doing the right thing. Or should he? Should he be involved with divulging information that no one should know to the whole world or should he not? Benedict and Daniel have amazing on screen chemistry and gravitas together.Of course the film is sprinkled with a love interest played by Alicia Vikander (A Royal Affair, Pure) which tends to slow the films pace a little, but the morality of what to do about information that no one is supposed to know is intriguing to say the very least and her character ads a little more color to the morale issues at hand.I liked the films detail and energy and except for the love interest aspect, the movie will definitely make you question your own moral center.

The acting is top notch with Mr. Cumberbatch pitch perfect as Julian Assange.  I don't know enough about the other people portrayed to know whether the actors captured them well, but overall I enjoyed their portrayals.  The best scenes in the movie involve the early stages of Wikileaks ensuring their anonymity through shuffling servers around and even purchasing used equipment to help their bandwidth requirements.The movie ends in the early stages of the aftermath of the 2010 diplomatic documents leak and left me wanting to see more of the blowback.  The movie touches on a few subsequent events, notably Mr. Assange's legal troubles, in the end via excerpts from an interview (not an actual interview but Cumberbatch's portrayal) and on-screen text.Ultimately the movie proved to be a solid showing of the events but I can't help but think a second chapter would enhance this movie by expanding on the aftermath and better telling the story of what happened to those involved.  Maybe in a few years there will be enough material for someone to consider such a continuation of the story.I recommend renting rather than purchasing this movie.

The problem with this piece is its choice of source material which, admittedly, is currently limited.As an analogy for whether or not you would choose to watch this film ask yourself if you are first a fan of what Julian Assange has contributed to society and journalism.  If you think he's a creep, you'll love this movie, which is told from the point of view by a person who was Assange's right arm until Assange kicked him out of WikiLeaks.A comparison would be: what if a movie were made about Jesus but the source material was taken from a book written by Judas? In such a version Judas would be the hero and therefore Jesus, according to the rules of story telling would have to come off as an egotistical, megalomaniac who cared primarily for glory. Judas, conversely, would come off as the voice of reason who betrayed his master for the greater good.This is the version of the WikiLeaks story you will see in The Fifth Estate.Aside from the fact that this is a one-sided telling of the story there are other problems with this piece from a filmmaking point of view. First, it is extremely long and second it is packed with tons of information to which you must pay very close attention. Watch this movie with a large coffee and your finger on the pause button because it is the only way you'll be able to follow the nuance and minutia of detail necessary to understand the character's motivations.For example: for reasons I cannot understand the filmmakers decided to frame shots that include words you're supposed to read off laptop screens with the laptop framed in a medium-shot. Meaning, it's like reading micro font and because of the fast-paced editing you get mere seconds to assimilate important data.For this reason I deducted two stars.

THE FIFTH ESTATE is about how WikiLeaks got started and covers some of their biggest leaks up to the release of the Afghanistan and Iraq war logs. Most of the focus is on the relationship between Daniel Berg (Daniel Bruhl) and Julian Assange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and how they have a falling out. While this might have been a critical part of the WikiLeaks story, the way it played out onscreen didn't exactly make for the most compelling drama. There were also some detours into Berg's personal life as well a limited international look at the effect these leaks had in various countries, to include the US. Still, I had hopes that this movie would be this generation's equivalent of something like THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, but it simply isn't. While the performances are all capable, and the ensemble cast that Bill Condon rounded up is fairly impressive, the narrative lacks the proper focus and doesn't adequately portray the gravity of what is being presented. Other issues include pacing and attempts at being current and tech-savvy that just come off as distracting. The material is presented almost in documentary-like fashion, down to the handheld camerawork, but nothing in the central story is given much context, outside of American embarrassment at having their secret diplomatic cables released. There was also little insight given into Assange's character that could have made him more relatable. Instead, we get a portrait of a rather sad and lame individual. As far as the technical qualities are concerned, there really isn't anything to complain about but there really isn't anything that makes it stand out either. The music, which included lots of electronica, was alright but it wasn't anything I particularly loved. Overall, this was a rather disappointing watch due to the pedestrian approach it took.

1632333,A4YXKE5F62II8,B00BEIYRYM,Visual Bureau,"[2, 2]","""While the film has been receiving a lot of bad press for its contrived storyline and execution, poor direction, absymal box office record (only $3m in the United States to date) and Julian Assange himself not approving of the script claiming it as fabricated, The Fifth Estate, which is technically a film about Daniel Berg's viewpoint about the rise and sort-of fall of Wikileaks was surprisingly genuine, intense, philosophical, and appropriately complex yet it is no masterpiece and it is not an easy watch.For starters, the performances all are promising and the increasingly famous Benedict Cumberbatch has performed brilliantly as Assange mimicking much of his accent and his bizarre and witty mannerisms. Daniel Bruhl's character as Berg is humanising and serves as a good counterpoint to Assange's might including surprisingly good performances from f***ing Malcolm Tucker (I mean,...Peter Capaldi) and Carice van Houten. The film works on many levels by presenting a multi-perspective story with plenty of locales, events, and characters present that sometimes it is hard to keep up but the element of immediacy and danger within the scandals, political turmoil, and questionable journalism/press-related activities all make for intriguing and intellectually stimulating viewing yet the idea that some of the actualities are hindered by docudrama or uncertain remove some of its excellence here.This is reminiscent of the trendy topical films that have come out like The Social Network and State of Play, films where technology is the core centre of the narratives. The idea that Assange was a rogue journalist is one of the reasons why this film looked more compelling as a potential Oscar contender (but with its 38% Rotten Tomatoes score, this will not likely be the case) and the opening scenes which involve a montage of sequences showing the evolution of the press and closing scenes which explain about Assange's refuge in an Ecuadorian embassy in London serve to point the audience at the meta-awareness that journalism, ideas, and the press all have its faults. That, by-and-large, were the best scenes (and probably the most celebratory this year in 2013) in the whole film despite it being too explanatory.A lot goes on in this film but even the little details, the dream sequences which serve to explain the frustrated psyche of Berg and Assange, the excellent choice of music (Amon Tobin, of all things, is featured in a scene where the guys are in Berlin), and the strong cinematography (plenty of shots of Europe in its murky glory) and the humorous moments and mood is immediate and fierce and prefers not to squander for the usual sentimentality and silliness that exists in some Hollywood dramas/thrillers and especially Oscar-nominated dramas too.Bill Condon, despite his poor record directing the Twilight films recently, has bettered himself this time round with The Fifth Estate and if you thought the bad press and Assange's cover-up of alleged issues he has had with people is all hocus-pocus, why not give it a try but your best bet is to see it on Sky Box Office or TV to avoid being rejected.""",4,"Scatterbrain but still an ambitious, high-scale Robin Hood-like tale of journalistic integrity and power in epic proportions",1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,3130,"['film', 'been', 'receiving', 'lot', 'bad', 'press', 'contrived', 'storyline', 'execution', 'poor', 'direction', 'absymal', 'box', 'office', 'record', 'only', '3m', 'United', 'States', 'date', 'Julian', 'Assange', 'not', 'approving', 'script', 'claiming', 'fabricated', 'Fifth', 'Estate', 'technically', 'film', 'Daniel', 'Berg', 'viewpoint', 'rise', 'sort-of', 'fall', 'Wikileaks', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'genuine', 'intense', 'philosophical', 'appropriately', 'complex', 'masterpiece', 'not', 'easy', 'watch.For', 'starters', 'performances', 'are', 'promising', 'increasingly', 'famous', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'performed', 'brilliantly', 'Assange', 'mimicking', 'much', 'accent', 'bizarre', 'witty', 'mannerisms', 'Daniel', 'Bruhl', 'character', 'Berg', 'humanising', 'serves', 'good', 'counterpoint', 'Assange', 'might', 'including', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'performances', 'f***ing', 'Malcolm', 'Tucker', 'mean', 'Peter', 'Capaldi', 'Carice', 'van', 'Houten', 'film', 'many', 'levels', 'presenting', 'multi-perspective', 'story', 'plenty', 'locales', 'events', 'characters', 'present', 'hard', 'keep', 'up', 'element', 'immediacy', 'danger', 'scandals', 'political', 'turmoil', 'questionable', 'journalism/press-related', 'activities', 'make', 'intriguing', 'intellectually', 'stimulating', 'viewing', 'yet', 'idea', 'actualities', 'are', 'hindered', 'docudrama', 'uncertain', 'remove', 'excellence', 'here.This', 'reminiscent', 'trendy', 'topical', 'films', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'Social', 'Network', 'State', 'Play', 'films', 'where', 'technology', 'core', 'centre', 'narratives', 'idea', 'Assange', 'was', 'rogue', 'journalist', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'film', 'looked', 'more', 'compelling', 'potential', 'Oscar', 'contender', '38', '%', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'score', 'will', 'not', 'likely', 'be', 'case', 'opening', 'scenes', 'involve', 'montage', 'sequences', 'showing', 'evolution', 'press', 'closing', 'scenes', 'explain', 'Assange', 'refuge', 'Ecuadorian', 'embassy', 'London', 'serve', 'point', 'audience', 'meta-awareness', 'journalism', 'ideas', 'press', 'have', 'faults', 'by-and-large', 'were', 'best', 'scenes', 'probably', 'most', 'celebratory', 'year', '2013', 'whole', 'film', 'being', 'too', 'explanatory.A', 'lot', 'film', 'even', 'little', 'details', 'dream', 'sequences', 'serve', 'explain', 'frustrated', 'psyche', 'Berg', 'Assange', 'excellent', 'choice', 'music', 'Amon', 'Tobin', 'things', 'featured', 'scene', 'where', 'guys', 'are', 'Berlin', 'strong', 'cinematography', 'plenty', 'shots', 'Europe', 'murky', 'glory', 'humorous', 'moments', 'mood', 'immediate', 'fierce', 'prefers', 'not', 'squander', 'usual', 'sentimentality', 'silliness', 'Hollywood', 'dramas/thrillers', 'especially', 'Oscar-nominated', 'dramas', 'too.Bill', 'Condon', 'poor', 'record', 'directing', 'Twilight', 'films', 'recently', 'bettered', 'time', 'round', 'Fifth', 'Estate', 'thought', 'bad', 'press', 'Assange', 'cover-up', 'alleged', 'issues', 'had', 'people', 'hocus-pocus', 'why', 'not', 'give', 'try', 'best', 'bet', 'see', 'Sky', 'Box', 'Office', 'TV', 'avoid', 'being', 'rejected']",The Fifth Estate
