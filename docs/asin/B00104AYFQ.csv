Save yourself and skip this worthless piece of crap.A story of a children's book author whose illustrator, maybe his father, dies of a brain tumor and throughout the movie comes back to rebuke the author.

He has no redeeming qualities and basically  hates everyone, including the children he writes for in his ""Marty the Beaver"" books .  It is hard to even feel pity for such a jerk.  He talks to his recently dead partner and piles heavy objects on himself to feel safe.  If this were a study in psychological disorders, it might get interesting.  No...it is attempting to be funny but is merely annoying.Mandy Moore plays a messy illustrator, who despite a good education, has not found her way and lives off her mother's resentful dole. Her publisher forces her to work with Crudup to get him to finish his next Beaver book.  She also is considering whether to take back her now-successful, author-boyfriend who dumped her a year before.  There is a very thin plotline that he has dedicated his soon-to-be published book to her, in hopes this will  be the big gesture that earns him forgiveness.  But as a backup, he wrote the same dedication to another girlfriend, and is waiting until the last minute before publication to decide which girl gets the dedication.  Mandy is unaware of this, but Crudup finds out, and in his one kind gesture, resists telling her to spare her feelings.Inexplicably, Mandy takes to Crudup after a brief couple of exchanges of not-clever repartee where he insults and demeans her. Suddenly, after looking at stars through a telescope, they kiss then hop into bed.  There is absolutely no chemistry between them and the script completely fails in creating any reason where this reasonably sane and pretty girl would find this nut-job appealing.  Unlike Helen Hunt in ""As Good As It Gets"", who is truly desperate enough to give Jack Nicholson's narcissistic character a consideration when he provides medical care for her child, Mandy is charmed by some rock Crudup gives her.  Yes, I get it that Mandy is the vehicle to ""save"" Crudup from his inner demons, but it just didn't work.  I wanted to yell at her, ""take the old boyfriend back"".  At least he looked reformable.",2,Bad Script.

1123851,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00104AYFQ,Ed Uyeshima,"[8, 12]","Like the central protagonist, this 2007 movie is a misbegotten mess. Making his directorial debut, actor Justin Theroux gets carried away with every film school trick in the book with self-conscious camerawork, annoying jump cuts and a music soundtrack that apparently has to comment on every scene. With a strangely cryptic first-time screenplay by David Bromberg, the movie boasts an impressive cast that includes Tom Wilkinson and Dianne Wiest, but it asks us to empathize with an obsessive-compulsive misanthrope whose actions alienate everyone around him. The ploy is too challenging since the character is more cruel than unfiltered, and his relentless bitterness rarely crackles with the wit necessary to get away with such boorish behavior. Moreover, subsequent attempts to humanize him feel increasingly contrived as the story progresses.The story revolves around Henry Roth, a prickly, phobic children's book author (an intentionally ironic profession for such an uncaring jerk) who bonds only with his longtime collaborator, a curmudgeonly illustrator named Rudy. They finally achieve success with a book about Marty the Beaver's campaign to save Christmas, but then Rudy dies. Henry's poker-faced editor, Arthur Planck, wants a sequel and consequently hires a young artist named Lucy to take Rudy's place. Lucy has her share of problems - a mother who is also her landlord and willing to evict her, and an errant lover named Jeremy who wants her back after dumping her. The movie's title is derived from the dedication to Lucy in Jeremy's about-to-be-published book. Motivated by a large bonus offered by Planck, Lucy is willing to subject herself to Henry's nasty comments, but of course, a romance develops. This is where the film falters badly as the love story is sketchily developed with little discernible chemistry between the two stars.The cast provides whatever redeeming value the film has. The usually audacious Billy Crudup does what he can as Henry, but it's an uphill battle. Better here than in last year's execrableBecause I Said So, Mandy Moore brings a certain poignancy to her scenes, but her downbeat character is so depressing that the only logical response to their romance is indifference. Wilkinson easily steals his scenes as Rudy both pre- and post-mortem, while Bob Balaban plays Planck in his typically low-key fashion. Wiest plays Lucy's mother in just a couple of tersely acted scenes, while Amy Sedaris, Peter Bogdanovich, Christine Taylor and Bobby Cannavale show up in cameos.

I made a point to check it out eventually, which I did tonight.Billy Crudup portrays Henry, a misanthropic children's book writer with more than his share of idiosyncrasies. After his illustrator (played by Tom Wilkinson) dies, he's partnered with Lucy (Moore), who agrees to work with Henry after being offered a substantial amount of money to do so. Henry's abrasive and non-endearing behavior inhibits Lucy from the start, and makes for an extremely uncomfortable working environment. Given the fact that they have less than a month to produce a complete book, this adds to their predicament.The script to this movie, I found disjointed. At no point did I ever believe that Lucy could ever be attracted to Henry. While I did like the back-and-forth approach between the surrealistic and absurdist angles to telling the story, as well as the returns to reality, this movie just never gets too far off the ground. I thought it was well-directed, but the actors can only do so much with the bad script they were given to work with.Crudup does a great job at making you dislike his character, and Moore shows significant acting growth from her earlier roles (which, in my opinion, mirrors the musical growth she has displayed in recent years, coming from a bubblegum pop past). I hope that she continues to challenge herself, acting-wise. She really has the talent for it, and this was a great role for her. It's just too bad that the movie itself is forgettable.I wanted to like this movie a lot. The bottom line is that I didn't.",2,What a disappointment,1263081600,"01 10, 2010",2010,1609,"['learned', 'movie', 'accidentally', 'really', 'looking', 'info', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'made', 'point', 'check', 'out', 'eventually', 'did', 'tonight.Billy', 'Crudup', 'Henry', 'misanthropic', 'children', 'book', 'writer', 'more', 'share', 'idiosyncrasies', 'illustrator', 'played', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'partnered', 'Lucy', 'Moore', 'who', 'work', 'Henry', 'being', 'offered', 'substantial', 'amount', 'money', 'do', 'so', 'Henry', 'abrasive', 'non-endearing', 'behavior', 'inhibits', 'Lucy', 'start', 'extremely', 'uncomfortable', 'working', 'environment', 'Given', 'fact', 'have', 'less', 'month', 'produce', 'complete', 'book', 'predicament.The', 'script', 'movie', 'found', 'disjointed', 'point', 'did', 'ever', 'believe', 'Lucy', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'attracted', 'Henry', 'did', 'back-and-forth', 'approach', 'surrealistic', 'absurdist', 'angles', 'telling', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'returns', 'reality', 'movie', 'just', 'never', 'too', 'far', 'ground', 'thought', 'was', 'well-directed', 'actors', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'bad', 'script', 'were', 'given', 'work', 'with.Crudup', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'dislike', 'character', 'Moore', 'shows', 'significant', 'acting', 'growth', 'earlier', 'roles', 'opinion', 'musical', 'growth', 'displayed', 'recent', 'years', 'coming', 'bubblegum', 'pop', 'past', 'hope', 'challenge', 'acting-wise', 'really', 'talent', 'was', 'great', 'role', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'movie', 'forgettable.I', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'lot', 'bottom', 'line', 'did', ""n't""]",Dedication

So much more could of been done with the plot by expanding on the discourse between characters. The relationship between the love interests was vague at best and nonexistent at worst.

But, the arc of his opening up to the possibility of love, trusting it and finally pursuing and accepting it, is worth the quirky ride.  The supporting characters, his partner, his agent and, finally Mandy Moore as his imposed illustrator, play their roles capably.  The writing has some exquisitely memorable lines - please hold out for ""Life is a skip for joy"" because, in context, it is an affirmation that makes this film what a movie should be:  challenging, compelling, a bit difficult in reaching the end but worth the ride.
