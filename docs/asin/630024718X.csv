226111,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,630024718X,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Julia, 1977 filmThis is based on a book by Lillian Hellman that tell about her past with a childhood friend Julia. Its fault is that it is too long and overproduced. A lower budget would have prevented these problems. We see Lillian&#8217;s personal life, with and without Dashiell Hammett. Lillian is encouraged to write a play that become a hit in New York City and other places that would appreciate it. Lillian came from a wealthy background as did her friend Julia. Julia went to Europe to take part in anti-fascist activities (which are undefined). One day Lillian gets a request to smuggle $50,000 in American dollars (as good as gold) into Nazi Germany. [That was a huge sum when the minimum wage was 25 cents an hour.]This movie provides an example in undercover work with people you don&#8217;t know and will never see again. A password provides identification (but also allows infiltration by anyone who knows the password). These personal isolation prevents the Gestapo from rolling up the network should any member be caught and talk. Their police had ways to make people talk. At the end Julia is killed by Nazi followers. Lillian learns Julia&#8217;s family wants nothing to do with her remains, as if they had written her off years ago. [No mention of that in this story.] Lillian was told Julia had a child, but she is unable to locate her and bring her to America. [Looser immigration laws then?] So at the end Lillian has only memories. They say people aren&#8217;t dead as long as they are remembered by family and friends. &#8220;Where are the snows of yesteryear?&#8221;I never read any of Lillian Hellman&#8217;s novels; they were more in fashion decades ago. How many read the novels of Dashiell Hammett (or Raymond Chandler) today? Do you remember the books by Mary Roberts Rinehart? In 1971 President Nixon banned all currency with a face value over $100. Before this there were $500, $1,000, $2,000, and $5,000 notes. Nixon&#8217;s permanent devaluation of the dollar caused ongoing inflation, falling wages and rising taxes. This was his real crime, not a bungled burglary. &#8220;Any stick is good enough to hit a dog.&#8221;",2,Life in the 1930s,1402444800,"06 11, 2014",2014,2154,"['Julia', '1977', 'filmThis', 'based', 'book', 'Lillian', 'Hellman', 'tell', 'past', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Julia', 'fault', 'too', 'long', 'overproduced', 'lower', 'budget', 'would', 'have', 'prevented', 'problems', 'see', 'Lillian', '8217', 'personal', 'life', 'Dashiell', 'Hammett', 'Lillian', 'encouraged', 'write', 'play', 'become', 'hit', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'other', 'places', 'would', 'appreciate', 'Lillian', 'came', 'wealthy', 'background', 'did', 'friend', 'Julia', 'Julia', 'went', 'Europe', 'take', 'part', 'anti-fascist', 'activities', 'are', 'undefined', 'One', 'day', 'Lillian', 'request', 'smuggle', '50,000', 'American', 'dollars', 'as', 'good', 'gold', 'Nazi', 'Germany', '[', 'was', 'huge', 'sum', 'when', 'minimum', 'wage', 'was', '25', 'cents', 'hour', ']', 'movie', 'example', 'undercover', 'work', 'people', 'don', '8217', 'know', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'password', 'identification', 'also', 'infiltration', 'anyone', 'who', 'password', 'personal', 'isolation', 'Gestapo', 'rolling', 'up', 'network', 'should', 'member', 'be', 'caught', 'talk', 'Their', 'police', 'had', 'ways', 'make', 'people', 'talk', 'end', 'Julia', 'killed', 'Nazi', 'followers', 'Lillian', 'Julia', '8217', 'family', 'nothing', 'do', 'had', 'written', 'off', 'years', 'ago', '[', 'mention', 'story', ']', 'Lillian', 'was', 'told', 'Julia', 'had', 'child', 'unable', 'locate', 'bring', 'America', '[', 'Looser', 'immigration', 'laws', 'then', ']', 'So', 'end', 'Lillian', 'only', 'memories', 'say', 'people', 'aren', '8217', 'dead', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'remembered', 'family', 'friends', '8220', 'Where', 'are', 'snows', 'yesteryear', '8221', 'never', 'read', 'Lillian', 'Hellman', '8217', 's', 'novels', 'were', 'more', 'fashion', 'decades', 'ago', 'How', 'many', 'read', 'novels', 'Dashiell', 'Hammett', 'Raymond', 'Chandler', 'today', 'Do', 'remember', 'books', 'Mary', 'Roberts', 'Rinehart', '1971', 'President', 'Nixon', 'banned', 'currency', 'face', 'value', '100', 'were', '500', '1,000', '2,000', '5,000', 'notes', 'Nixon', '8217', 'permanent', 'devaluation', 'dollar', 'caused', 'ongoing', 'inflation', 'falling', 'wages', 'rising', 'taxes', 'was', 'real', 'crime', 'not', 'bungled', 'burglary', '8220', 'stick', 'good', 'enough', 'hit', 'dog.', '8221']",N/A

MacNeil ""Chris M""","[40, 44]","Too bad this one's out of stock, but worse was that the poltical backlash Vanessa Redgrave's Best Supporting Actress acceptance speech detracted from the film's importance. Despite that, ""Julia"" may well be the best work in Redgrave's and Jane Fonda's impressive bodies of work. For the latter, the film launched the socially-themed works that followed, and Fonda may well have come of age in this one. She plays writer Lillian Hellman to Redgrave's title character, an upper-class rich kid who grows into social activist and lays her life on the line to smuggle condemned Jews from the death camps of Hitler's Third Reich. Redgrave is superlative, and Fonda is rivting as Julia's childhood friend who gradually comes to recognize the evil unleashed by man on man at the time. As Julia's long-time lover, Dashell Hammitt, the late Jason Robards nailed down one of his back-to-back Supporting Actor Oscars (""All the President's Men"" was the other), and the raw talent of the Fonda-Redgrave-Robards package helps make ""Julia"" one of Fonda's best works. The importance of the film's subject matter is so overwhelming that it easily displaces the Vietnam-related controvery that dogged (and may still) Fonda through the '70s and the unpopular words Redgrave used in her Oscar acceptance speech (she was literally booed off the stage).

226121,ACJVGDN8G386P,630024718X,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[0, 0]","We often learn about the past from text books and documentaries which detail larger conflicts, such as the rise of Nazism in Germany which leads to World War II. Although understanding the larger history is certainly important, experiencing a story about how individuals and their lives are forever changed by conflict can be as important and even more enlightening. &#34;Julia&#34; is a film chronicling how several people's lives are changed by the rise of fascism in Germany.The story is told by and centered on Lillian Hellman (Lilli, as portrayed by Jane Fonda, academy-nominated for Best Actress) about her childhood friend Julia (Vanessa Redgrave in an academy-award winning performance) who becomes an active force against fascism in Vienna and Germany before World War II. She originally comes from a wealthy family in Britain. As a minor, Julia resides with her grandparents in a country estate larger than many small towns in the mid-west, and her young friend Lillian often visits her. (The younger Lilli and Julia are played by younger actors who are nearly as convincing as their older counterparts.) However, unlike her grandparents, Julia shows from a young age an interest in social issues and class inequity. The narrative often juxtaposes between Julia and Lilli when they are young and their lives as adults. But even when young, Julia and Lilli engage in discussions about social injustice. At one point, Julia recounts a visit to Cairo where she sees the immense and widespread poverty. When she comments on what she sees, her grandparents say &#34;Don't look at them.&#34;The story also has another thread: Lillian Hellman, struggling female playwright living with the immortal Dashielle Hammet at a beach house probably near cape cod or Connecticut north of New York. She strives to write a good play. Hammett is her ultimate critic, and has no sympathy when she's unable to produce to her potential. The three narratives are constantly being interspersed: Lillian as a girl with her young friend Julia, Lillian as the struggling writer with Hammett, and her friendship with Julia as an adult. At one point, she finishes her first play, &#34;The Children's Hour&#34;, which makes her a national and international celebrity.While we mostly see Julia in flashback, we meet Julia rarely in the present-moment of the narrative. The first is a devastating incident concerning Nazis infiltrating a hospital where Julia works, probably providing care for the needy. Then later, when she is vacationing with southern friends in Paris, Lilli receives a message from Julia via a strange man who speaks about a cause and movement against Hitler. Julia and the members of the movement request Lillian to engage in a task, which at the forefront seems simply and yet is potentially dangerous.Every once in awhile, a film which is both moving and insightful appears on the screen. &#34;Julia&#34;, which at the beginning seems more like a character study of Lilli, Hammett, and Julia, until the sequence concerning her mission turns the story into a riveting plot. Underneath the entire experience are overtones about the rages and ultimate tragedy of fascism. This is by far my favorite performance by Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave, whose friendship appears like you might imagine two people who have known each other for a long time. A bit to my disappointment, the character of Julia may in fact be somewhat fictional. Hellman in her book Pentimento, which contains the novella entitled Julia for the which the film is based, may be a combination of fact and fiction.

226122,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,630024718X,Classic film buff,"[5, 5]","In the autumn of 1977, after a severe lack in the last few years of strong, complex women's roles in films several promising movies were slated to open where the female(s) would be front and center.  These included Anne Bancroft and Shirley MacLaine in ""The Turning Point"", Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek in ""3 Women"", Marsha Mason in ""The Goodbye Girl"" and Diane Keaton in ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"".  However probably the most eagerly anticipated of them all was Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave in ""Julia"".  Not only was this to be Fonda's comeback Hollywood film, after her self-imposed exile and political blacklisting, but also there was avid curiosity to see these two notorious political firebrands playing radical women of the 1930's.  People wanted to see if art would mirror life.As the film opens, it's early morning and there is a solitary figure sitting in a rowboat fishing on a mist-shrouded lake.  She is Lillian Hellman (Jane Fonda), the renowned playwright and author, now an aging woman.  Her thoughts are expressed in an inner monologue as she revisits her life as a young woman and remembers the two strongest influences in molding and developing her character.  They are her lover and literary mentor for many years, the esteemed writer Dashiell Hammett (Jason Robards), and her best friend from childhood, the beautiful, passionate, socially committed Julia (Vanessa Redgrave).  The majority of the film is set in the early to late 1930's where Lillian's two complicated relationships with Julia and Hammett are intertwined.  Hammett and Lillian live together in a cottage on Long Island Sound as she tries to write her first play, and he serves as editor and critic.  Blocked, Lillian decides to take a sabbatical in Europe, intending to visit Julia there who is studying for a medical degree in Vienna, living in a sector that has socialist and left wing activists striving to create positive political change.  However Julia is brutally beaten and injured in a fascist riot, Lillian visits her twice in the hospital but then Julia is removed to an unknown destination for additional surgery and rehabilitation.  An extremely frustrated and concerned Lillian is unable to make contact with her, and reluctantly returns home.  She reworks her play, ""The Children's Hour"", it is a smash hit on Broadway and she is the toast of the town.  In 1937, Lillian takes another trip to Europe and tries to visit with Julia.  In the lobby of her Paris hotel Lillian is approached by a nondescript middle-aged stranger who identifies himself as Johann (Maximilian Schell).  He is a friend of Julia's and gives Lillian a letter from her.  In it, Julia asks a critical favor of Lillian to smuggle $50,000 into Nazi Germany for her to use to bribe Nazis to release Jews and other political prisoners.  Lillian will need to take a train that will let her off in Berlin where she will exchange the money with a courier.  Although Julia warns Lillian not to do it if she truly feels she can't, that there will be no dishonor, after some soul searching she decides to take on this dangerous mission.Fonda is unqualifiedly marvelous as the legendary writer Lillian Hellman.  She is like a tightly coiled spring, ready to snap, releasing an incendiary temper.  Her body language is tense and contained, her guard continually up, and she seldom seems to relax fully except when she is with Julia.  Yet, Fonda suggests the many currents channeled inside Hellman, the relentless drive to be the best, her fierce integrity and her honest, forthright character.  Her Hellman is not always endearing, but she will earn your respect and ultimately admiration.  She incorporates a quirky little gesture the real Hellman used, which is making the sign of the cross while saying ""Oi veh!' which adds a nice touch of authenticity.  In addition Fonda uses a cigarette for a prop better than any actress since Bette Davis, and looks very sleek and stylish most of the time.  This performance earned her a third Best Actress Oscar nomination, a Golden Globe, a British Film Academy Award and sealed her Hollywood comeback.As the title character Vanessa Redgrave doesn't come off quite as well.  However, this is not her fault.  Lillian Hellman's autobiography was entitled ""An Unfinished Woman"" and that exactly pinpoints the problem with the character of Julia both in Hellman's original ""Pentimento"" and Alvin Sargent's screenplay, she is an enigma, as ephemeral as a puff of smoke, too one sided and saintly, having no real flaws, and seems more like a symbol of nobility and justice rather than a flesh and blood woman.  Redgrave is a luminous presence with a perfect American accent but really only has the opportunity to register strongly in her wordless scene in the hospital and especially in the meeting with Lillian in the Berlin caf&eacute;.  This is hands down the best scene in the film and Fonda and she soar with it.  These two scenes are what earned her the Best Supporting Actress Oscar.The supporting cast is quite good, Jason Robards as the craggy, laconic Dashiell Hammett won his second Best Supporting Actor in a row.  He and Fonda work much more fortuitously together than in their initial pairing eleven years earlier in the fluffy ""Any Wednesday"".  Maximilian Schell in a cameo part as Johann makes such an impact that he was nominated as well for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar.  As the adolescent Julia and Lily, Lisa Pelikan and Susan Jones are well cast in terms of resemblance to Redgrave and Fonda.  Rosemary Murphy (also an ""Any Wednesday"" alumna!) and Hal Holbrook are diverting as another noteworthy writer, Dorothy Parker and her husband Alan Campbell.  Although I find Meryl Streep vastly overrated as an actress, for those that fancy her, she makes her film debut in a tiny part.  Finally I do want to mention the veteran actress Cathleen Nesbitt who appears as Julia's grandmother, and clicks in her brief moments as a grande dame.In his next to last film master director Fred Zinnemann displays his usual meticulous craftsmanship and sensitivity.  The script by Alvin Sargent is for the most part a skillful, literate adaption of Hellman's story, and he won an Oscar for his efforts.  Great care and taste were evidenced in putting this film together, it's handsome, elegant, with a classic style as evidenced in the production design by Gene Callahan, Carmen Dillon and Willy Holt, and the costume design by Anthea Sylbert.  The cinematography by Douglas Slocombe with exteriors in Oxford and Paris is outstanding as is the original musical score by George Delerue.Critically lauded for the most part, ""Julia"" performed quite well at the box office and was nominated for 11 Academy Awards including besides those mentioned above, nominations for Best Picture and Director.  Now many years later it seems to have slipped somewhat out of favor, the only extra besides the subtitle options are its original trailer.  Too bad Fonda and Redgrave didn't do a commentary; their insights into the film would have been interesting.  Perhaps a possible reason might be when it was released ""Julia"" was advertised with the byline ""Based on a true story"". However now there is a high degree of skepticism of it's authenticity, despite Lillian Hellman' insistence that it all actually occurred as written.  More probably, on some strong evidence that has been presented the chapter of ""Julia"" in her book ""Pentimento"" was most likely fiction based on a real life counterpart Muriel Gardiner, an American heiress working for the Austrian resistance during the initial Nazi occupation before the outbreak of World War II.  Although they never met Hellman and she shared the same lawyer, and it is thought he told Hellman Gardiner's story, which had many parallels to Julia's.  Regardless, it is worth a viewing for what may be the only chance to see two of the finest film actresses of their generation act together, plus see the final film success of renowned director Fred Zinnemann.",4,"""But I trust absolutely what I remember about Julia""",1310601600,"07 14, 2011",2011,7998,"['autumn', '1977', 'severe', 'lack', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'strong', 'complex', 'women',

If anything, ""Julia"" has improved over the years, time having rendered the former controversies over the politics of Fonda and Redgrave and the truth or falsity of Hellman's narrative irrelevant.Every character in this film is finely delineated: Jane Fonda as the insecure chain-smoking author, Lillian; Vanessa Redgrave as her best friend in the title role [and the word ""luminous,"" with which several reviewers characterize Redgrave's performance, does not constitute hyperbole]; Jason Robards as Lilly's gruff but tender mentor and lover; Maximilian Schell as Julia's impoverished anti-fascist go-between; and the two actresses who play Lilly and Julia as young girls. All are superb.""Julia"" is arguably one of the best espionage films ever produced in Hollywood.  The image of a transcontinental train hurtling through the snow-blown night, just as the world is hurtling headlong into war, evokes danger and guarantees entertainment of the highest calibre.

226126,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,630024718X,Gregor von Kallahann,"[5, 12]","Occasionally, when I'm dashing off a review for amazon.com, I will try to adopt a less subjective, somewhat more professional style.  Sometimes this is little more than a kind of writing exercise: sometimes it may be just because I've looked at some of my other reviews and seen (much to my own embarrassment) how often the pronoun ""I"" comes up.  Who needs that?But then *I* think there really are some advantages to talking about film in a subjective mode.  Perhaps more than any other art form (except maybe, popular music and--if you view it as an artform--television), the movies just about beg for a subjective analysis.  It's what made reading Pauline Kael so much fun after all.  Ultimately, movie criticism is about what you like, what moved you, whether or not you could relate to the action on the screen, whether or not you even WANTED to relate to the action on the screen.  The whole schmier.And another advantage to the subjective approach--so often, when I re-watch a movie, I respond to it completely differently from the last time.  A film you loved twenty years ago has you scratching your head and saying, ""WHAT was I thinking.""  And a film you detested can take on a positive new light for reasons that you can't even begin to put your finger on.  You may even find that you go back and forth with a given film to the extent that you begin to realize that subjective commentary may be the ONLY truly honest commentary.Case in point, Fred Zinneman's 1977 film JULIA.  There was a time when I was very ambivalent (and really mostly negative) about this movie.  It seemed to be an exercise in earnestness, kind of ""special project"" movie that the relatively recently politicized Jane Fonda undertook so frequently in the 1970s.  Actually, though, I found that the political story worked pretty well.  The subplot about Lillian's struggles to establish herself as a playwright nearly drove me up the wall, precisely for the reasons that others have detailed here.  The scenes of her chainsmoking, tearing her hair--and actually throwing the typewriter out the window (try doing that with your computer these days) virtually SCREAMED ""serious writer at work.""  When I watched this film in my 20s, I wasn't very patient with what I felt were cinematic cliches.When I watched the film again recently, I found that these scenes didn't bother me half as much as they had back then.  It may well be it's because I've seen hundreds of films in the interim and have come to realize that there is a kind of ""cinematic shorthand"" (a much friendlier term than ""cinematic cliche, wouldn't you say?) that has always been employed (whether you're talking about images of the hands of clock speeding by--or calendar pages being torn off--or something as basic as a voiceover, a device central to the film JULIA).  I seem to have grown a lot more patient with such cinematic conventions over the years.  And in the case of JULIA, I have actually started to see the typewriter throwing as further possible evidence of a self-mythologizing tendency on the part of Lillian Hellman, the author of the film's source material, the ""memoir"" PENTIMENTO.Mary McCarthy has been widely quoted as having said that every word that Lillian Hellman ever wrote was ""a lie, including 'the' and 'and.'  I don't know enough about Hellman or McCarthy to comment extensively.  But the film, perhaps inadvertantly, raises a lot of interesting questions about the very nature of what a memoir is, or a film biography.  If Lillian Hellman sought self-aggrandizement, which seems likely, does she also not touch on some very real truths about the nature of courage and heroism.  And in the end, doesn't she (or maybe don't the filmmakers) tell a pretty good story?Take it with a grain--or a shaker--of salt.  Put some of it on your popcorn.  And enjoy a remarkable story about two remarkable women.  In this po-mo world, we're becoming used to taking every tale as a fiction.  When it's told with good acting, good direction, good cinematography, and, yes, mostly good writing, it's pretty easy to take a few ""lies"" with the truth, the chaff with the wheat, and to still take a few lessons from the process.",4,Truth?

It holds up very well indeed. Starring Jane Fonda as the writer Lillian Hellman and directed by Fred Zinnemann (""A Man for All Seasons"") it is based on a story taken supposedly from Hellman's memoir PENTIMENTO although Reynolds Price in his latest memoir ARDEN SPIRITS accuses Hellman of ""purloining"" incidents from the life of Muriel Gardiner Buttinger. At any rate the story of what happens to Julia (Vanessa Redgrave) and her fight against fascism in the 1930's makes for high drama of the first order. Both Redgrave and Jason Robards, who plays Dash Hammett, Hellman's lover, both received Oscars for their performances. Maximilian Schell and Hal Holbrook have minor roles, and Meryl Streep has a few lines as well. This seems to me to be Jane Fonda at her best-- she looks terribly young and beautiful-- before she started playing herself as so often happens to actors as they get older. Certainly she is in good company here: think Katharine Hepburn and Jack Nicholson as two examples. Oh, and Redgrave, never one to shun controversy, is just as famous-- or infamous, depending on your point of view-- for her ""Zionist"" remarks in her Oscar acceptance speech as she is for this very fine performance.The film opens and closes with the same peaceful scene with voice over from Hellman's memoir.

Redgrave, Robards and Sargent won their statuettes.Fonda plays Hellman, who in the early 1930s was an angry, struggling wannabe playwright, living with mystery writer Dashiell Hammett (Robards).  With success still eluding her, she travels to Europe, hoping to find a better atmosphere in which to write, and also to visit with her oldest and dearest friend, Julia (Redgrave), daughter of a very wealthy family who is studying medicine in Vienna.Julia is also involved in an anti-Fascist/anti-Nazi movement, which has resulted in her being badly injured.  In fact, after Hellman visits her in the hospital, she disappears.  Years later, after she has become a Broadway success, Lillian is asked by Julia, via a political acquaintance (Schell), to undertake a dangerous clandestine mission against the Nazis.Though much of it may be fiction, JULIA is a gripping, moving, often suspenseful drama that stays with viewers long after it has ended.

The attention to detail in costumes, set decorations, props, locations dazzle you and place you  squarely in another time and place.  The performances, particularly the  intimate friendship between Fonda as Hellman and Redgrave as Julia, blow  you away.  Redgrave embodies this brilliant character with knowing  subtlety; you get the feeling she is Julia to some degree, and probably is.  The exploration of adult friendship in a time of peril finds its center in  a well-crafted suspense story that only ever hints at real danger, yet it  is the slow and deliberate revelations regarding Julia's fate that provide  tension and heartbreak.  This is a purposely artful film, with its share of  indulgence, but each one works as a part of a lovely whole.
