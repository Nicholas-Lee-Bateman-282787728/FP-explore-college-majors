1586759,A13J5V22IPFWNU,B0097FLLRU,B. Ying,"[1, 2]","I have not seen ""Sweeney"" the popular British police TV series from the '70s.I tend to think the police TV series from that era were more civilized and subtle.After watching this new update film about a team of crime busters within the metropolitan police of London,I got the impressions that the filmmakers made this film targeting the violence-loving younger audience and AR15 fancy crowd.The film is about a team of 'elite', 'throw-away-the-book', wooden club toting, never hesitate to pull the triggerbunch of crime busters under the banner of police whose thuggish and self-important behavior made this viewerwished to root for the criminals.Ray Winston, the veteran British actor whom I admired played the leader of the gang(Sweeney) who carried on a torridaffair with one of his younger female subordinates who's also the estranged wife of his higher ranking police official.The passionate sex scenes between the couple kind of tarnished Winston's tough guy screen statue, especially one scenethat exposed his naked prominent gut.Ben Drew who played Winston's deputy did not leave much impressions.Damien Lewis who plays Winston's superior was left standing around without much to do.The heist and action sequences were well-orchestrated with a lot of shootings but mostly missing the targets.This is another film with all the fanfare and not much substance.",3,Is This the New Sweeney?,1363132800,"03 13, 2013",2013,1365,"['have', 'not', 'seen', 'Sweeney', 'popular', 'British', 'police', 'TV', 'series', ""'70s.I"", 'tend', 'think', 'police', 'TV', 'series', 'era', 'were', 'more', 'civilized', 'subtle.After', 'watching', 'new', 'update', 'film', 'team', 'crime', 'busters', 'metropolitan', 'police', 'London', 'got', 'impressions', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'film', 'targeting', 'violence-loving', 'younger', 'audience', 'AR15', 'fancy', 'crowd.The', 'film', 'team', ""'elite"", ""'throw-away-the-book"", 'wooden', 'club', 'toting', 'never', 'hesitate', 'pull', 'triggerbunch', 'crime', 'busters', 'banner', 'police', 'thuggish', 'self-important', 'behavior', 'made', 'viewerwished', 'root', 'criminals.Ray', 'Winston', 'veteran', 'British', 'actor', 'whom', 'admired', 'played', 'leader', 'gang', 'Sweeney', 'who', 'carried', 'torridaffair', 'one', 'younger', 'female', 'subordinates', 'who', 'also', 'estranged', 'wife', 'higher', 'ranking', 'police', 'official.The', 'passionate', 'sex', 'scenes', 'couple', 'kind', 'tarnished', 'Winston', 'tough', 'guy', 'screen', 'statue', 'especially', 'one', 'scenethat', 'exposed', 'naked', 'prominent', 'gut.Ben', 'Drew', 'who', 'played', 'Winston', 'deputy', 'did', 'not', 'leave', 'much', 'impressions.Damien', 'Lewis', 'who', 'Winston', 'superior', 'was', 'left', 'standing', 'around', 'much', 'do.The', 'heist', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'well-orchestrated', 'lot', 'shootings', 'mostly', 'missing', 'targets.This', 'film', 'fanfare', 'not', 'much', 'substance']",The Sweeney

1586761,A3D9AL7ENJ1I20,B0097FLLRU,clay,"[1, 3]","Look,I agree with previous reviewers' as far as the story goes for this film.Even if the plot is all over the place, on the whole I still enjoyed it.However ,I am skeptical about certain aspects of the characters and the way some of the action panned out.It just didn't ring true for me and I'll have you know I am the kind of person who is willing to stretch the imagination to the limit.In Australia we saw the original series on television and even though I was very young I still remember that this special team of cops 'The Flying Squad' were an elite team dedicated to the task of bringing down the most hardened and professional of robbery crews.This led by British hard man of the time John Thaw.Fit, lean and very tough.Now, in my opinion Ray Winstone didn't quite fit the bill.Don't get me wrong ,I love Ray Winstone and have seen just about everything he's been in.He is quite the tough character,but there was talk of Tom Hardy playing the role ,who I thought would have been more suited.WARNING, Spoiler ahead.This applies to the situation in the film where he's having an affair with Hayley Atwell's character who is also in the squad.I just didn't buy it.Have you SEEN this girls figure ? She's HOT.A voluptuous brunette,quite good looking who is a slightly slimmer,British version of Christina Hendricks from Mad Men(look her up on youtube,interview with Craig Ferguson,she's wearing a blue dress,you'll see what I mean)The fact that she's a married women who's having an affair with a fat, balding ,average looking bloke who's at least fifteen years older than her ,well , as I said, I didn't buy it.Tom Hardy sure ,but Ray ? I don't know, maybe I'm being too picky and maybe her character was drawn to the power and position of Ray's character but this wasn't explored.I am a big fan of Hayley's, so maybe I'm biased ,even though I didn't really buy into the fact that SHE wouldn't be in a squad like that herself and this showed through in some of the action scenes.She runs like a duck,not athletic at all.I have to be critical of the last action scene as well, where Ray's offsider George Carter gets slammed fair in the hip by a car going at least 50k's an hour.He doesn't leap up and bounce off the bonnet and then rebound off the windscreen,he would have wound up in hospital for sure, but in the last scene he's sitting at his desk with his ARM in a sling ???? Come on !!!I can see why it wasn't released in American cinemas', probably because they do this kind of thing better.Having said that and being perhaps overly critical, you should still check it out.The acting is superb with a great support cast.Damian Lewis of 'Homeland' who is under used I might add, playing the all suffering ""Guvna"" .You can cut the tension with a knife in some of the scenes' ,as Hayleys husband is the head of Internal Affairs who are investigating  The Sweeney  because the old school methods they use to get their collars are outdated ,and he hates Regans guts.See what you think.",3,It's okay,1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,2992,"['Look', 'agree', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'as', 'far', 'story', 'film.Even', 'plot', 'place', 'whole', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'it.However', 'am', 'skeptical', 'certain', 'aspects', 'characters', 'way', 'action', 'panned', 'out.It', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', ""'ll"", 'have', 'know', 'am', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'willing', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'limit.In', 'Australia', 'saw', 'original', 'series', 'television', 'even', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'still', 'remember', 'special', 'team', 'cops', 'Flying', 'Squad', 'were', 'elite', 'team', 'dedicated', 'task', 'bringing', 'down', 'most', 'hardened', 'professional', 'robbery', 'crews.This', 'led', 'British', 'hard', 'man', 'time', 'John', 'Thaw.Fit', 'lean', 'very', 'tough.Now', 'opinion', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'bill.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'have', 'seen', 'just', 'everything', 'been', 'in.He', 'quite', 'tough', 'character', 'there', 'was', 'talk', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'playing', 'role', 'who', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'suited.WARNING', 'Spoiler', 'ahead.This', 'situation', 'film', 'where', 'having', 'affair', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'character', 'who', 'also', 'squad.I', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'it.Have', 'SEEN', 'girls', 'figure', 'HOT.A', 'voluptuous', 'brunette', 'quite', 'good', 'looking', 'who', 'slightly', 'slimmer', 'British', 'version', 'Christina', 'Hendricks', 'Mad', 'Men', 'look', 'up', 'youtube', 'interview', 'Craig', 'Ferguson', 'wearing', 'blue', 'dress', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'fact', 'married', 'women', 'who', 'having', 'affair', 'fat', 'balding', 'average', 'looking', 'bloke', 'who', 'least', 'fifteen', 'years', 'older', 'well', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'it.Tom', 'Hardy', 'sure', 'Ray', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'picky', 'maybe', 'character', 'was', 'drawn', 'power', 'position', 'Ray', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'explored.I', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Hayley', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'biased', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'buy', 'fact', 'SHE', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'squad', 'herself', 'showed', 'action', 'scenes.She', 'duck', 'not', 'athletic', 'all.I', 'have', 'be', 'critical', 'last', 'action', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'where', 'Ray', 'offsider', 'George', 'Carter', 'slammed', 'fair', 'hip', 'car', 'going', 'least', '50k', 'hour.He', ""n't"", 'leap', 'up', 'bounce', 'off', 'bonnet', 'then', 'rebound', 'off', 'windscreen', 'would', 'have', 'wound', 'up', 'hospital', 'sure', 'last', 'scene', 'sitting', 'desk', 'ARM', 'sling', 'Come', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'released', 'American', 'cinemas', 'probably', 'do', 'kind', 'thing', 'better.Having', 'said', 'being', 'perhaps', 'overly', 'critical', 'should', 'still', 'check', 'out.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'great', 'support', 'cast.Damian', 'Lewis', ""'Homeland"", 'who', 'used', 'might', 'add', 'playing', 'suffering', 'Guvna', '.You', 'can', 'cut', 'tension', 'knife', 'scenes', 'Hayleys', 'husband', 'head', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'who', 'are', 'investigating', 'Sweeney', 'old', 'school', 'methods', 'use', 'get', 'collars', 'are', 'outdated', 'Regans', 'guts.See', 'what', 'think']",The Sweeney

1586764,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B0097FLLRU,CriticNic,"[0, 0]","I hadn't heard of the elite British crime squad known as Flying Squad, or commonly known as ""Sweeney"" prior to watching this UK actioner starring Ray Winstone. The film is inspired by the real life Flying Squad of the London Metropolitan police force, officers set on stopping and preventing armed crimes. Winstone's character Regen leads his group of hardened officers to bring down the mastermind behind a seemingly straightforward armed robbery. Loyalties and relationships are put to the test, while authority is challenged all in the name of justice. Veteran Winstone drives the film as a tough as nails leader, while his younger crew made up of Ben Drew and Hayley Atwell among others impress as well. From the opening scene I knew this was my style of movie - the wild introduction of the Sweeney capturing some bad guys was both humorous and thrilling. The sleek crime flick features shootouts reminiscent of Heat, adrenaline-fueled car chases, and a story with enough twists and turns to keep things interesting. The film is cleanly shot, gritty where it needs to be, and is ultimately insanely entertaining. I would have liked to have seen a little more depth with the characters - while there are a few hints here and there dealing with characters personal dilemmas, the focus seems ultimately to be on the action. All in all the film is well done, gripping, and gives you everything you look for in a crime action flick. The Blu-ray video and sound quality are excellent, which does a film like this justice.Source: criticnic.com 21 April 2013Disclosure: Film sent by eOne Films",4,Solid action flick,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,1590,"['had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'elite', 'British', 'crime', 'squad', 'known', 'Flying', 'Squad', 'commonly', 'known', 'Sweeney', 'prior', 'watching', 'UK', 'actioner', 'starring', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'film', 'inspired', 'real', 'life', 'Flying', 'Squad', 'London', 'Metropolitan', 'police', 'force', 'officers', 'set', 'stopping', 'preventing', 'armed', 'crimes', 'Winstone', 'character', 'Regen', 'group', 'hardened', 'officers', 'bring', 'down', 'mastermind', 'seemingly', 'straightforward', 'armed', 'robbery', 'Loyalties', 'relationships', 'are', 'put', 'test', 'authority', 'challenged', 'name', 'justice', 'Veteran', 'Winstone', 'film', 'tough', 'nails', 'leader', 'younger', 'crew', 'made', 'Ben', 'Drew', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'others', 'impress', 'as', 'well', 'opening', 'scene', 'knew', 'was', 'style', 'movie', 'wild', 'introduction', 'Sweeney', 'capturing', 'bad', 'guys', 'was', 'humorous', 'thrilling', 'sleek', 'crime', 'flick', 'features', 'shootouts', 'reminiscent', 'Heat', 'adrenaline-fueled', 'car', 'chases', 'story', 'enough', 'twists', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'film', 'cleanly', 'shot', 'gritty', 'where', 'be', 'ultimately', 'insanely', 'entertaining', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'little', 'more', 'depth', 'characters', 'are', 'few', 'hints', 'here', 'there', 'dealing', 'characters', 'personal', 'dilemmas', 'focus', 'ultimately', 'be', 'action', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'gripping', 'everything', 'look', 'crime', 'action', 'flick', 'Blu-ray', 'video', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'excellent', 'film', 'justice.Source', 'criticnic.com', '21', 'April', '2013Disclosure', 'Film', 'sent', 'eOne', 'Films']",The Sweeney

1586770,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B0097FLLRU,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[0, 0]","Way back in the Seventies THE SWEENEY was seen as a groundbreaking police drama, its gritty stories and violent sequences setting a standard that few rival series could match.  The series made stars of John Thaw and Dennis Waterman, and spawned two films, neither of which really approached the television drama in terms of quality and sharpness of writing (from Troy Kennedy Martin).  Nick Love's remake adds some more earthy language, but basically keeps close to the structure of the television series, with the use of realistic London locations and deliberately washed out color photography.  Ray Winstone's Regan is perhaps more world-weary than John Thaw; the way he mumbles his lines is reminiscent of an English Marlon Brando.  Although this kind of role is made for Winstone's craggy features, he seems a little too old and portly for a tough, no-nonsense cop.  Ben Drew, as Regan's sidekick Carter, doesn't have too much to do other than to reveal an enduring loyalty to his superior - he seems a little colorless, as if believing in his heart of hearts that he could not match Waterman's characterization in the television series.  Damian Lewis turns up as Haskins, the Flying Squad's boss - once again he seems too young for the role, lacking the gravitas that Garfield Morgan brought to the television series.  The direction is fast, and there are plenty of action sequences to cover up some of the more implausible aspects of the plot (how Regan gets sprung out of jail is anyone's guess).

What makes a good one into a great one is subject to much debate, but there's a gritty, hard-boiled sensibility to most of the better ones.  You know the kind.  They explore cops who - for whatever reason - have been pushed to the edge, forced to adopt a kind of flexible morality when it comes to the manner and methods they go about getting their jobs done.  And by `getting their jobs done,' I'm not talking about collecting a paycheck.  Rather, I'm speaking about scraping up the scum off the streets and putting them behind bars where they belong.  These cops will do whatever it takes to keep their neighborhoods clean, and it's these cops that - in time - audiences embrace in such a way that they'll return for repeat viewings over and over again.For those of you who haven't figured it out yet, I'm talking Dirty Harry Callahan.

Jack Regan (played by Ray Winstone) heads it up, along with his right-hand man George Carter (Ben Drew).  Together, they're willing to bloody some knuckles up in keeping the streets clean.  But when a master criminal returns from a long absence, events unfold too quickly for the Sweeney to keep it all under their thumb.  A major bank heist takes a turn for the worst, and, before all is said and done, it might be the cops on the chopping block instead of the villains!This is an old school police procedural - the kind where the cops aren't all that afraid from mixing it up with the heavies - and that's chiefly because THE SWEENEY is based on a mid-1970's UK TV show of the same name.  As a contemporary revisioning, they've kept a lot of the charm of the original - the cops were often shown engaging in borderline illegal (if not illicit) activity in order to catch crooks or stay one-step-ahead.  Writer/director Nick Love clearly has some affinity for what that show did, and, thus, he ignites his cast with a script that pays homage to an older but no less effective measure of handling police work.Winstone is winning as the aggressive lead, but he's also given the chance to explore a romance with a fellow officer (played by CAPTAIN AMERICA's Hayley Atwell).  While that story doesn't really have much depth, it's nice to see the big, burly blowhard trying to come to grips with feelings not quite imbued with the same type of passion.  Also, Drew gets good mileage out of a role that, perhaps, was a bit underwritten here; clearly, Winstone captures the lion's share of the screen time, but Drew manages to flex his chops when the script allows.  Think of him as an affordable Tom Hardy.If there's any major qualm worth mentioning, it's that Winstone's accent occasionally gets in the way of understanding just precisely what he's saying.  I've mentioned before (in other reviews) that there are some accents I struggle with, and I have had trouble with Winstone's in other pictures.  Still, it's easy to brush it aside because this is a strong picture that could've given us a few more lines to cement some of the complexity of these relationships (Regan has a regular senior-level informer who gets a few scenes, and I'm never quite sure who he is, who he works for, and how he knows what he knows).  Otherwise, it's a stand-up flick about a bunch of stand-up guys (and a few girls) doing a stand-up job.THE SWEENEY is produced by Vertigo Films and Embargo Films.  DVD distribution is being handled through Entertainment One (E One).  As for the technical specifications, the film looks and sounds impressive consistently from start-to-finish, and it's all backed by some very stylish cinematography of London.  To my delight, the disk is packed with special features: there's an audio commentary with the director and producers; several behind-the-scenes shorts (varying in ranges from a few minutes up to about a half-hour); and even some presentation of animated storyboards for the film's two big action sequences.  It's a wonderful collection for a film that swept in-and-out of theatres very quickly, so fans should soak it up because they're great supplementals.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  I can't recall the last time I had so much fun with a balls-to-the-wall cop thriller, but THE SWEENEY sure hit the sweet spot.  My American ears did have some difficulty understanding Winstone's thick accent, but his gunplay and fisticuffs more than made up for it in the end.  It's the kind of lean, muscular flick Michael Mann used to make before he started going all big names and big budget (not intended as an insult, just an observation), and I've no doubt more folks will enjoy this one as it gains wide release on home video.  Maybe - maybe - I would've liked to tighten up the story in a few places, but to each his own ...In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Entertainment One (E One) provided me with an advance DVD copy of THE SWEENEY by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",4,Muscular Cop Film A Throwback To 70's Sensibilities,1364256000,"03 26,

This violent R-rated actioner will have you covering your eyes, stifling your giggles and checking your watch. The kindest thing I can say is that maybe this is a pilot for a re-launch of the series.This is a formulaic bunch of nonsense suffering from an overdose of testosterone: brutal, bloody, and profane. It features the worst gunfight in the history of cinema. The squad itself is effective (even thought they can't hit the broad side of a barn), but its methods are so shocking we are left with no one to root for.We see:* Damian Lewis (""Homeland"") I knew things were bad when I couldn't even root for DCI Frank Haskins. Lewis is an actor who could even give Soames Forsyte a bit of humanity in ""The Forsyte Saga.""* Ray Winstone (""Hugo"") is DI Jack Regan, brutal, vicious and, according to his mistress, pretty good in bed. I was surprised he put out his cigarette long enough to have sex. He always looks like he needs a shower.* Hayley Atwell (""The Duchess"") is DC Nancy Lewis, married to DCI Ivan Lewis and getting it on with DI Jack Regan.*  Steven Mackintosh (Lots of TV) is tightly-wound DCI Ivan Lewis, married to the gal who...oh you know, boilerplate misbehavior and ersatz scandal...if only we cared...* Ben Drew (""Turnout"") is DC George Carter, an Eminem look-alike, hoodie and all, a young copper who clearly admires his brutal, slightly bent boss.We are treated to station-house humor: extremely vulgar and obviously relished by all the guys on screen. We in the audience didn't catch many of the jokes because we either couldn't hear or understand them.

1586776,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0097FLLRU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","""The Sweeney"" is an update of a British police drama that aired on television from 1975-78.  I, myself, have never seen this TV show, but I have heard that some of its fans were not too pleased with this adaptation.  Without having any pre-set expectations, though, I found this a relatively successful actioner that keeps up a frantic pace and features a great cast.  At times, it is riddled with illogical moments and inconsistencies.  But overall, I was swept along with the plot.  One important note, though, Ray Winstone and Ben Drew (the two leads) allow their brogue to overwhelm their dialogue for much of the movie.  I turned on the subtitles about 5 minutes into the movie and it helped considerably.  ""The Sweeney"" isn't necessarily a great movie, but it is an effective one.The Sweeney refers to an elite police squad known for getting results at any cost.  Winstone is their leader, the subject of an internal affairs investigation.  I especially loved that the squad is accused of brutality and unnecessary force as they oftentimes bring baseball bats to a gun fight!  After a spiffy introduction, with the team taking down an armed robbery, the main case is revealed.  A jewelry store robbery results in the senseless murder of a young woman.  Winstone has seen the pattern before and targets a criminal from his past.  But as further crimes unfold, is he letting his tunnel vision get the better of him?  When things turn more personal and tragic, however, all bets are off.  Winstone and his protege (Drew) will have to work outside the law to settle the score.The film is filled with plenty of fights, shoot-outs, and gun battles.  You can't always get caught up in what makes sense, though.  One foot chase, in particular, would have endangered hundreds of civilians as semi-automatic weapons blaze through the city streets.  In another, a trailer park is brutalized but no one pops out to see what is happening.  But still, these sequences are exceedingly well executed.  If you can turn your brain off a bit, you can have some fun with the gritty unpleasantness of it all.  Winstone is an imposing figure and Drew acquits himself well. Other names in the cast include Hayley Atwell and Damien Lewis.  Atwell, who is lovely, has to (of course) convince you that she wants to have sex with Winstone and so I'll give her special note for that.  ""The Sweeney,"" in the end, is what it is.  It doesn't have lofty goals, it just seeks to entertain.  And I liked it.  Its relentless pace help you overlook some of its plotting flaws.

1586778,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B0097FLLRU,MadMacs,"[50, 59]","Let me preface this review with a statement that is required for UK residents: Have never seen the original tv program this film is based on.That said, I was stunned to see some of the harsh and, in my opinion, completely undeserved criticism. (via Amazon.co.uk) And I'm already prepped and ready to take on all comers in stating this:Fellow film fans in the UK have no concept of what makes a truly bad reboot, revamp, or remake. Let me tell you about being an American who regularly screens disappointment. 'Red Dawn' or the steaming pile called 'Dark Shadows' being prime examples. In all sincerity, you guys across the pond have gotten way too used to high quality moviemaking. Spoiled, you need to live here for a while, maybe get a good dose of 'Footloose'.Again, I'm prepped. Simply because in order to ""defeat"" me, you have to provide lousier examples of bad filmmaking. Sadly, in that category, we Americans have you beat hands down. And because Brits almost never produce something lousy, the weight of evidence is greater on your shoulders. Oh certainly there's adequate, uninspired, and repetitive - but never lousy. In my experience, there's usually something good to say about all UK film productions. Unlike Hollywood, which consistently churns out lousy like the receiving end results of a competitive eater's toilet.As mentioned, and for those not acquainted with 1970s UK television, this is a reboot of the classic hardcore cop drama featuring a team of famous no-nonsense investigators - The Flying Squad. As of this writing, a retired division within the metropolitan police service of London whose history dates back nearly one-hundred years.The specialized service was tasked as an action force dedicated to assess, prevent and interdict organized robbery crews. A seemingly straight forward mission. But like previous team leaders, the current head and his lieutenant, Jack Regan and George Carter respectively, came up the hard way. Resentful of paper-pusher cops and desk-bound computer arrests, the pair knows that to catch a dirty thief, sometimes you have to get just as dirty. No laptop is going to break a suspect, no legalese stack of charges will stop hardcore recidivism. Knocking heads is what these lowlifes know and that's what they're used to - so that's what they're going to get.As squad leader, Jack often finds himself racing along a razor thin line between civil servant and criminality. Repeatedly blurring that line, much to the barely concealed contempt of his immediate superiors. But he delivers the goods - arrests and successful prosecutions - so he and his team are left alone.Until he encounters a gang like no other.Without realizing it, the squad's success becomes the foundation for their destruction. Savvy criminals have worked out that fighting Sweeney isn't working. Instead, they realize that in order to beat the squad, they have to adopt their tactics; turning them against itself. By employing counter-intelligence to identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities, studying the behaviors and patterns of their foes, and essentially laying out an elaborate trap which the team can't help themselves but to fall into. Doing to Jack what was done to them for so long.His team destroyed, his reputation in ruins, and stuck in a prison filled to the brim with brutal convicts; many of whom owe their incarceration to him personally. His life is over.But can one really keep bull of a man like Jack Regan down?Hardcore tough and thoroughly enjoyable flick with one of my favorite versatile performers in the form of barrel-chested, testosterone-infused Ray Winstone.Really hope they do another film.Movie Notes:- From Wikipedia: The programme's title derives from Sweeney Todd, which is Cockney rhyming slang for 'Flying Squad'.- One of the most notable missions of The Sweeney was preventing the Millennium Dome Heist. Interdicting a professional gang of thieves from nicking over a half-a-billion dollars in diamonds belonging to De Beers, including the stunning 203 carat Millennium Star, by itself having a shocking value of USD$400 million.- Was the basis for the wildly popular US version: 'The Shield' starring Michael Chiklis.Personal Note:- I honestly believe every filmmaker who does a modern showdown owes a debt of gratitude to Michael Mann's 'Heat'. &lt;g>",4,Hardcore Grit,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2013,4320,"['Let', 'preface', 'review', 'statement', 'required', 'UK', 'residents', 'Have', 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'tv', 'program', 'film', 'based', 'on.That', 'said', 'was', 'stunned', 'see', 'harsh', 'opinion', 'completely', 'undeserved', 'criticism', 'Amazon.co.uk', ""'m"", 'already', 'prepped', 'ready', 'take', 'comers', 'stating', 'Fellow', 'film', 'fans', 'UK', 'have', 'concept', 'what', 'truly', 'bad', 'reboot', 'revamp', 'remake', 'Let', 'tell', 'being', 'American', 'who', 'regularly', 'disappointment', 'Dawn', 'steaming', 'pile', 'called', ""'Dark"", 'Shadows', 'being', 'prime', 'examples', 'sincerity', 'guys', 'pond', 'have', 'gotten', 'way', 'too', 'used', 'high', 'quality', 'moviemaking', 'Spoiled', 'need', 'live', 'here', 'while', 'maybe', 'get', 'good', 'dose', ""'Footloose'.Again"", ""'m"", 'prepped', 'Simply', 'order', 'defeat', 'have', 'provide', 'lousier', 'examples', 'bad', 'filmmaking', 'Sadly', 'category', 'Americans', 'have', 'beat', 'hands', 'down', 'Brits', 'almost', 'never', 'produce', 'something', 'lousy', 'weight', 'evidence', 'greater', 'shoulders', 'Oh', 'certainly', 'adequate', 'uninspired', 'repetitive', 'never', 'lousy', 'experience', 'usually', 'something', 'good', 'say', 'UK', 'film', 'productions', 'Hollywood', 'consistently', 'out', 'lousy', 'receiving', 'end', 'results', 'competitive', 'eater', 'toilet.As', 'mentioned', 'not', 'acquainted', '1970s', 'UK', 'television', 'reboot', 'classic', 'hardcore', 'cop', 'drama', 'featuring', 'team', 'famous', 'no-nonsense', 'investigators', 'Flying', 'Squad', 'writing', 'retired', 'division', 'metropolitan', 'police', 'service', 'London', 'history', 'back', 'nearly', 'one-hundred', 'years.The', 'specialized', 'service', 'was', 'tasked', 'action', 'force', 'dedicated', 'assess', 'prevent', 'interdict', 'organized', 'robbery', 'crews', 'seemingly', 'straight', 'forward', 'mission', 'previous', 'team', 'leaders', 'current', 'head', 'lieutenant', 'Jack', 'Regan', 'George', 'Carter', 'respectively', 'came', 'up', 'hard', 'way', 'Resentful', 'paper-pusher', 'cops', 'desk-bound', 'computer', 'arrests', 'pair', 'catch', 'dirty', 'thief', 'sometimes', 'have', 'get', 'just', 'dirty', 'laptop', 'going', 'break', 'suspect', 'legalese', 'stack', 'charges', 'will', 'stop', 'hardcore', 'recidivism', 'Knocking', 'heads', 'what', 'lowlifes', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'used', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'get.As', 'squad', 'leader', 'Jack', 'often', 'racing', 'razor', 'thin', 'line', 'civil', 'servant', 'criminality', 'Repeatedly', 'blurring', 'line', 'much', 'barely', 'concealed', 'contempt', 'immediate', 'superiors', 'goods', 'arrests', 'successful', 'prosecutions', 'so', 'team', 'are', 'left', 'gang', 'realizing', 'squad', 'success', 'foundation', 'destruction', 'Savvy', 'criminals', 'have', 'worked', 'out', 'fighting', 'Sweeney', ""n't"", 'working', 'Instead', 'realize', 'order', 'beat', 'squad', 'have', 'adopt', 'tactics', 'turning', 'employing', 'counter-intelligence', 'identify', 'weaknesses', 'vulnerabilities', 'studying', 'behaviors', 'patterns', 'foes', 'essentially', 'laying', 'out', 'elaborate', 'trap', 'team', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'Doing', 'Jack', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'so', 'long.His', 'team', 'destroyed', 'reputation', 'ruins', 'stuck', 'prison', 'filled', 'brim', 'brutal', 'convicts', 'many', 'whom', 'owe', 'incarceration', 'personally', 'life', 'over.But', 'can', 'one', 'really', 'keep', 'bull', 'man', 'Jack', 'Regan', 'down', 'Hardcore', 'tough', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'flick', 'one', 'favorite', 'versatile', 'performers', 'form', 'barrel-chested', 'testosterone-infused', 'Ray', 'Winstone.Really', 'hope', 'do', 'film.Movie', 'Wikipedia', 'programme', 'title', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Cockney', 'rhyming', 'slang', ""'Flying"", ""Squad'.-"", 'One', 'most', 'notable', 'missions', 'Sweeney', 'was', 'preventing', 'Millennium', 'Dome', 'Heist', 'Interdicting', 'professional', 'gang', 'thieves', 'nicking', 'over', 'half-a-billion', 'dollars', 'diamonds', 'belonging', 'De', 'Beers', 'including', 'stunning', '203', 'carat', 'Millennium', 'Star', 'having', 'shocking', 'value', 'USD', '400', 'million.-', 'Was', 'basis', 'wildly', 'popular', 'US', 'version', ""'The"", 'Shield', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Chiklis.Personal', 'Note', 'honestly', 'believe', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'modern', 'showdown', 'debt', 'gratitude', 'Michael', 'Mann', ""'Heat"", 'lt', '>']",The Sweeney

The use of baseball bats and clubs by the 2012 Sweeney are a play on the use of baseball bats and clubs used by the 1970 Sweeny in then gun free England, when the 1970&#8217;s cops and the crooks mixed it up in down and dirty fist fights that were buttresses with brass knuckles, clubs, chains and anything else handy during an interrupted bank robbery, armored car holdup or what not heist.Gun battles in Britain were a no no in the 1970&#8217;s all of which changed with Britain joining what was then called the Common Market, which evolved into the European Union, and the building of the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France, ending England&#8217;s splendid isolation from evils of modern crime and allowing the illegal importation of firearms and there use in British society.Seeing John Thaw as the head-thumping, crook stumping Inspector Jack Reagan vs. the cultured opera loving Inspector Morse provides interesting insight into the craft of an actor, as I still recall one line from the 1970&#8217;s Sweeney series where Jack Reagan berates any copper or individual who shows an appreciation for opera.When I first viewed the 1970&#8217;s Sweeny films, I knew right away that the British were making better films in the 1970&#8217;s then we Americans were making in the 1990&#8217;s, and thus began my commerce in DVDs with Amazon.co.uk along with the purchase of a universal DVD player.The absence of racial stereotypes, and the depicting of nudity and sex play, both male and female in the 1970&#8217;s Sweeney showed British TV to be miles ahead of its American counter part, even up to the modern day, but alas, the British have now caught up with the Americans, making British sex scenes just as boring as the sex scenes made in Hollywood. The British police in the 2012 Sweeney announcing themselves to the bad guys by yelling &#8220;Armed Response&#8221; will no doubt confuse American audiences who don&#8217;t realize that many British cops still don&#8217;t carry side arms.  But alas again, what the British public doesn&#8217;t realize is that all their police will be carrying firearms in the future, just as their American counterparts do.And thus we arrive at the true meaning of the negative criticism from across the pond against the 2012 Sweeny film, and that is to wit that our British cousins and their culture have evolved into a culture that is exactly American. The 1970&#8217;s five year Sweeney TV series was the most popular show on British television, and the millions of TV viewers who watched that show must now realize, after viewing the 2012 Sweeney film, that there is now no difference between British society and American society.  And I&#8217;m sure there are a lot of unhappy faces about that evolution.I think the film would have been better if it had been made as a period piece in the 1970s.

That said, it looks pretty good -- very high contrast, lots of lovely night shots in London. Ray Winstone feels natural in the lead. Only three stars because the movie failed for me on two levels. First, it included too many of the genre's plot staples. I can't list them all here without spoiling the movie, but I will say that I thought the rivalry between Winstone and ""internal affairs"" was pointless, as was the brief segment in which Winstone is thrown in jail and has to defend himself against the vengeful thugs he had nicked. These could easily have been bumped to ""The Sweeney II,"" leaving this movie less cluttered.Second, the sound production on the film is lousy.

But by chance during a recent business trip to Sydney, I noticed the movie was playing in Australian cinemas and I took the time to go see this.""The Sweeney"" (2012 release from the UK; 112 min.) brings an update/refresh of the movie and subsequent UK TV series from the mid-1970s. As far as the plot is concerned, the movie focuses on the London special crime unit called ""the Sweeney"". As the movie opens we see the unit successfully interrupting a heist, and then going out to celebrate and let off some steam (the latter even literally as we see two of the Sweeney colleagues getting it on). The tension mounts when an interal compliance officer announces that he is going to ""observe"" the unit to make sure it plays by the rules (which of course it doesn't). Then a brutal jewelry hold-up happens, during which one of the innocent bystanders gets brutally killed. Will the Sweeney unit be successful in hunting down the perpetrators? What about the internal review of the unit? To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first, this is a very though and gritty police drama and not for the faint of heart, so viewer beware. I thought the at times dark and always intense tone of the movie was brought very well, and in fact reminded me on several occasions of Michael Mann's ""Thief"" movie some 3 decades ago. Several acting performacnes are noteworthy, none more so than Ray Winstone, as the veteran Sweeney unit leader. Last but not least, the photography of London in the movie is eye-candy, with numerous air shots that give a dramatic panorama of the City. Bottom line: I have no idea why this movie didn't make it to the big screen in the US, as by all means it should have.

Led by legendary Detective Jack Regan (Ray Winstone), the squad is not afraid to use old-school, bare-knuckle tactics to bring down the modern underworld.  Now, with a master criminal (Paul Anderson) on the loose and a major bank heist in progress, Regan will do whatever it takes to get the job done, even if that means defying the orders of his boss (Damian Lewis) and taking the law into his own hands.The members of the squad are stereotypes -- the Irish guy, the black guy, the jokester, and the one you know will not make it to the final credits alive.  There's also an Internal Affairs bureaucrat bent on bringing down Regan and his team.

Jack Reagan (Winstone) is an old school detective that does things his way much to the dismay of IA. He is on the case of a string of bank robberies as well as being investigated by his department for questionable tactics. When something goes wrong and he is stripped of his badge it is up to him to clear his name, stop the bad guy and save his department. I am a big fan of the British cop genre and this one is not a disappointment. Great story and acting makes this very very entertaining. The movie is full of twists which keeps you guessing what is happening and who is on what side right up until the end. That makes a movie fun to watch. This is a under the radar movie that I could keep going on about but if you are a fan of this genre like I am then this is a must see. I really enjoyed this.
