1694075,A189VV6P4IZJXI,B00IF0KAYS,Anthony McGill,"[64, 66]","Keenly waiting for this release of the complete collection of FRANCIS films. Wondering if I grew up on the Universal City backlot because what I remember most from my Saturday afternoon matinees at the local movie house are screenings of Abbott and Costello, Ma and Pa Kettle, Tony Curtis and Piper Laurie in the Arabian desert and of course, Francis the Talking Mule.  Thank you Universal-International, for catering for boys and girls of all ages during those so-called ""innocent"" days of the fifties.  Of these seven films, the first six were directed by Arthur Lubin and starred Donald O'Connor supported by the usual bevy of Universal-International contract players and wonderful character actors. Some of the up and coming stars to look out for are Tony Curtis, Clint Eastwood, Piper Laurie, Martha Hyer, Julie Adams, Mamie Van Doren, Gregg Palmer, David Janssen, Martin Milner and Paul Burke. Lubin was an interesting director who made the memorable 1943 version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"", ""Rhubarb"" (the cat), more or less discovered Clint Eastwood and created and produced the unforgettable MR. ED series for television. Mr. Lubin certainly made a career out of loveable animals which we should all be grateful for.  The series of FRANCIS movies were no classics but just highly entertaining fun flicks, full of corn and delight, helped enormously by O'Connor's likeability, the loveable mule and of course, the gravelly voice of Chill Wills. Incidentally the last film, probably the weakest of the series, featured a couple of significant changes: Mickey Rooney replaced O'Connor and Paul Frees became the ""voice"".  You won't be disappointed with these films.  Just sit back and enjoy them for what they are, just wacky, harmless entertainment for all.",5,MEMORIES OF A UNIVERSAL CHILDHOOD,1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,1766,"['Keenly', 'waiting', 'release', 'complete', 'collection', 'FRANCIS', 'films', 'Wondering', 'grew', 'up', 'Universal', 'City', 'backlot', 'what', 'remember', 'most', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'matinees', 'local', 'movie', 'house', 'are', 'screenings', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'Ma', 'Pa', 'Kettle', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'Arabian', 'desert', 'course', 'Francis', 'Talking', 'Mule', 'Thank', 'Universal-International', 'catering', 'boys', 'girls', 'ages', 'so-called', 'innocent', 'days', 'fifties', 'seven', 'films', 'first', 'six', 'were', 'directed', 'Arthur', 'Lubin', 'starred', 'Donald', ""O'Connor"", 'supported', 'usual', 'bevy', 'Universal-International', 'contract', 'players', 'wonderful', 'character', 'actors', 'up', 'coming', 'stars', 'look', 'out', 'are', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'Martha', 'Hyer', 'Julie', 'Adams', 'Mamie', 'Van', 'Doren', 'Gregg', 'Palmer', 'David', 'Janssen', 'Martin', 'Milner', 'Paul', 'Burke', 'Lubin', 'was', 'interesting', 'director', 'who', 'made', 'memorable', '1943', 'version', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Rhubarb', 'cat', 'more', 'less', 'discovered', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'created', 'produced', 'unforgettable', 'MR.', 'ED', 'series', 'television', 'Mr.', 'Lubin', 'certainly', 'made', 'career', 'loveable', 'animals', 'should', 'be', 'grateful', 'series', 'FRANCIS', 'movies', 'were', 'classics', 'just', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'flicks', 'full', 'corn', 'delight', 'helped', 'enormously', ""O'Connor"", 'likeability', 'loveable', 'mule', 'course', 'gravelly', 'voice', 'Chill', 'Wills', 'Incidentally', 'last', 'film', 'probably', 'weakest', 'series', 'featured', 'couple', 'significant', 'changes', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'replaced', ""O'Connor"", 'Paul', 'Frees', 'became', 'voice', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'films', 'Just', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'what', 'are', 'just', 'wacky', 'harmless', 'entertainment']",Francis the Talking Mule Complete Collection

All movies are presented here on 3 single sided DVDs (3 films on one, two each on the others) and are excellent transfers. It brings me back to my younger days (well AFTER these were released originally..lol) when I would watch these late at night on TV, good old fashioned comedy that didn't require crude jokes, sexual innuendo or nudity to get a laugh.This set also has English sub-titles for the Deaf/Hard of hearing on all movies. I like to have these on when watching a movie anyway at night so I don't have to have the TV on too loud. There is also French and Spanish sub-titles on all except &#34; In the Navy&#34; and &#34; The Haunted House&#34;.I give it 5 stars for the nostalgic enjoyment and entertainment of the films, the fact that they are on single-sided discs and have English sub-titles. It would've been nice to get maybe a documentary on the series, or maybe a commentary or 2 from film historians etc. but that was probably too expensive for the studio to consider.If you love comedies from this era, do yourself a favour and purchase this set. at less than $20 you get 7 fun movies, with plenty of memories and laughs.

But Champion was just an ordinary horse when compared to the other two, though he was the spitting image of Mr Ed and his TV series only lasted 1 year compared to Mr Ed, whose series lasted 5 years in the 1960's , if only Champion could talk, yet still he was The World's Wonder Horse .Whether it is Francis, or whether it is Mr Ed, it is fascinating to watch their head movements and lips as they talk, because these films were done way before special effects were done, and the vocal effects are so perfect, it's hard to believe that it isn't an actual person inside a costume doing the talking. Both of these characters were  smart alecky and wise cracking and quite mischievous and were a delight to watch.Mr Ed spent a lot of time in his barn, reading, watching TV, recording and singing love songs,, sometimes he would venture outside to try to pick up a philly, and in his ventures he got to meet with George Burns, Zsz Zsa Gabor and even Clint Eastwood. Francis, in this collection of 7 movies gets around in quite a lot of places, he goes to the races, he goes to West Point, he covers the big town, joins the WACS, goes in the Navy  and ends up in a haunted house, he also has a flair for the ladies and even ends up meeting Mamie Van Doren.So if you enjoy this collection of movies, then you might also want to check out the Mr ED TV series, lots of horsing around, you don't see this brand of comedy produced anymore.",5,Hee Haw,1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,1665,"['Talking', 'Mule', 'Mr', 'Ed', 'Talking', 'Horse', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'team', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'Lewis', 'Martin', 'even', '3', 'Stooges', 'maybe', 'could', 'have', 'got', 'Champion', 'Wonder', 'Horse', 'join', 'Champion', 'was', 'just', 'ordinary', 'horse', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'two', 'was', 'spitting', 'image', 'Mr', 'Ed', 'TV', 'series', 'only', 'lasted', '1', 'year', 'compared', 'Mr', 'Ed', 'series', 'lasted', '5', 'years', '1960', 'only', 'Champion', 'could', 'talk', 'yet', 'still', 'was', 'World', 'Wonder', 'Horse', 'Francis', 'Mr', 'Ed', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'head', 'movements', 'lips', 'talk', 'films', 'were', 'done', 'way', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'done', 'vocal', 'effects', 'are', 'so', 'perfect', 'hard', 'believe', ""n't"", 'actual', 'person', 'costume', 'doing', 'talking', 'characters', 'were', 'smart', 'alecky', 'wise', 'cracking', 'quite', 'mischievous', 'were', 'delight', 'watch.Mr', 'Ed', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'barn', 'reading', 'watching', 'TV', 'recording', 'singing', 'love', 'songs', 'sometimes', 'would', 'venture', 'try', 'pick', 'up', 'philly', 'ventures', 'got', 'meet', 'George', 'Burns', 'Zsz', 'Zsa', 'Gabor', 'even', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Francis', 'collection', '7', 'movies', 'around', 'quite', 'lot', 'places', 'races', 'West', 'Point', 'big', 'town', 'WACS', 'Navy', 'up', 'haunted', 'house', 'also', 'flair', 'ladies', 'even', 'up', 'meeting', 'Mamie', 'Van', 'Doren.So', 'enjoy', 'collection', 'movies', 'then', 'might', 'also', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'Mr', 'ED', 'TV', 'series', 'lots', 'horsing', 'around', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'brand', 'comedy', 'produced', 'anymore']",Francis the Talking Mule Complete Collection

There is more going on under the surface than at first appears (no spoilers, but the Army is not as dumb as some would like you to think... 'nuff said).  The first move is a real fun romp and the rest of the series carries on, just don't expect singing and dancing.
