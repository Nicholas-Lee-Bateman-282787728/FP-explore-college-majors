1612778,A91BK8S5QH98K,B00AKIP9Y4,CelticWomanFanPiano,"[7, 8]","This movie has some of the classic elements of a ""horse"" movie, but at the same time some substance that makes it a movie of its own.  A young girl finds out after her father dies that she has a Mother.  A real and live one, not one who died in childbirth like her Dad told her.  Naturally, there is shock on both sides.  And while she and her Mother try to make things work at least for a summer trial period, they do still both have adjustments to make.  Enter into the picture her Mother's boyfriend's horse farm and a special horse that only the girl can get to race well.  Unfortunately, there is a rival horse farm with a spy in their midst.  And they pick up the filly in a claims race only to proceed to beat her and mistreat the poor horse.  However, through the eventual rehabilitation of the horse with a trainer named Max, all turns out well.  The movie leaves one feeling refreshed and happy.  Which is a pleasant and rare feeling nowadays.  So I recommend this movie highly.  It only has one mild swear word in it.  So it is suitable for family viewing.",5,Refreshing.,1371168000,"06 14, 2013",2013,1067,"['movie', 'classic', 'elements', 'horse', 'movie', 'same', 'time', 'substance', 'movie', 'own', 'young', 'girl', 'out', 'father', 'Mother', 'real', 'live', 'one', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'died', 'childbirth', 'Dad', 'told', 'Naturally', 'shock', 'sides', 'Mother', 'try', 'make', 'things', 'work', 'least', 'summer', 'trial', 'period', 'do', 'still', 'have', 'adjustments', 'make', 'Enter', 'picture', 'Mother', 'boyfriend', 'horse', 'farm', 'special', 'horse', 'only', 'girl', 'can', 'get', 'race', 'well', 'Unfortunately', 'rival', 'horse', 'farm', 'spy', 'midst', 'pick', 'up', 'filly', 'claims', 'race', 'only', 'proceed', 'beat', 'mistreat', 'poor', 'horse', 'However', 'eventual', 'rehabilitation', 'horse', 'trainer', 'named', 'Max', 'out', 'well', 'movie', 'one', 'feeling', 'refreshed', 'happy', 'Which', 'pleasant', 'rare', 'feeling', 'nowadays', 'So', 'recommend', 'movie', 'highly', 'only', 'one', 'mild', 'swear', 'word', 'suitable', 'family', 'viewing']",Amazing Racer
