So it's completely appropriate for Mandy to remove himself from center stage.  Note to Hotch.  I didn't like most of the episodes in Season 2 of this show that I use to decompress.  I find shoot to kill agents chasing society's scumbags to be deeply relaxing however the tackiness of the perpetrators really stick in my craw sometimes starting with Season 1's Riding the Lightning when it was okay to not stop crimes against others but a mother's love is a sacred cow ... and Mandy wept ... knowing that the lowest of the low have no dearth of sympathy ... for themselves.  Those 13 murder victims will never have a musical solo.  And that is the same reason why I really dislike the Fisher King conclusion which explains the Unsub's self-justification for the harm he has caused and the distorting of the concept of chivalry and gallantry embodied by the Knights of the Round Table. Good grief, it's a lot to swallow.  I was so relieved that Joe Mantegna replaced Mandy and delivered a very Italian American style of pissed off stalking the stalkers and taking them DOWN.  Elle Greenaway would approve (and chortle.)  Season 2 is heavy on making excuses for standing by and ""letting"" murderers murder (even one of the BAU team members is guilty of this in Profiler, Profiled), killers self-romanticizing and when really it is as Mandy expressed in Season 1's ""Real Rain,"" murderers do it ""just because.""

I love it all the actors in it and the various ""unsubs"" that show up in each episode especially the season ending episode.  That marks the return of serial killer from someone in the BUAs past.  I like how the different characters have certain areas of expertise from a genius (Doctor) to tech genius (Garcia) love her character to one that drops down an interview and has more connects with newspapers and police than i've ever seen.Also enjoy the profiling of the suspects that they do in each episode and also the various dramas and highs and lows that each character in the group goes through from being kidnapped to coping with the aftermath of said kidnapping.  Hitting bottom and making their way back up.  I just love each and every episode.  I can't help but get into the stories with the way they are written and guest stars in Kate Jackson (Emily Prentiss') mother.  I hope the next season continues to bring it like the 2nd season has.  I know i won't be disappointed.The only bad part is i have to wait for season 3 to come out on DVD which isn't really i'm just really wanting to see how the third season opens up for everyone in the group.
