Season 3 saw the removal of Rebecca, a key role, and the destruction of Charlie, also key to the series. The writing was decidedly off and casting can't seem to keep any of their main players. The result is very generic, mediocre at best and lacks the class and wit of seasons 1 and 2. Two stars may be a little harsh, but it is Very disappointing to see a series die like this. Clearly the production reins were handed to someone's lack-wit nephew between season 2 and 3.",2,The beginning of the end of a great series,1368576000,"05 15, 2013",2013,591,"['Seasons', '1', '2', 'were', 'unique', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'was', 'prevailing', 'sense', 'style', 'made', 'stand', 'out', 'Season', '3', 'saw', 'removal', 'Rebecca', 'key', 'role', 'destruction', 'Charlie', 'also', 'key', 'series', 'writing', 'was', 'decidedly', 'casting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'keep', 'main', 'players', 'result', 'very', 'generic', 'mediocre', 'best', 'class', 'wit', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'Two', 'stars', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'harsh', 'Very', 'disappointing', 'see', 'series', 'die', 'Clearly', 'production', 'reins', 'were', 'handed', 'someone', 'lack-wit', 'nephew', 'season', '2', '3']",Hotel Babylon: Season 3
1215619,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B001LPWGHI,maskirovka,"[0, 0]","I think ""Hotel Babylon"" lost its ""mojo"" with the departure of Max Beesley as Charlie, the smooth talking hotel manager (and maybe it started to slip a bit in Season 2 with the departure of Rebecca).As others here have noted, it's not like the series turned into garbage overnight, but I think they began to run out of fairly plausible parts and came up with progressively less and less believable ones in their place.  This culminated in a plot line where the hotel staff decided to play the role of a SWAT team to deal with a hostage situation in one of the rooms...when you compare that with the better story-lines in Seasons 1 and 2, you really notice a qualitative drop.I've tried watching a couple of episodes of Season 4 and the decline pretty much intensified with the youngish hotel manager who replaced Max near the end of Season 3 vanishing without a trace and when I read that Anna (who shows up in the beginning of the season very pregnant with no explanation) leaves the show in the third episode, my interest in watching it dropped even further.  And when you add the fact that Season 4 ends with a cliffhanger that the show's cancellation leaves unresolved, that's a real put off.But I enjoyed most of ""Hotel Babylon"" and it's made me want to check out similar shows like ""the Grand.""  And maybe the production company will decide to do a reunion movie (like they sort of did with the abruptly canceled ""Farscape"" science fiction series) that sorts all the dangling plot threads out, but I'm not confident that will happen.",3,"The season where ""Hotel Babylon"" Jumped the Shark",1297900800,"02 17, 2011",2011,1538,"['think', 'Hotel', 'Babylon', 'lost', 'mojo', 'departure', 'Max', 'Beesley', 'Charlie', 'smooth', 'talking', 'hotel', 'manager', 'maybe', 'started', 'slip', 'bit', 'Season', '2', 'departure', 'Rebecca', '.As', 'others', 'here', 'have', 'noted', 'not', 'series', 'turned', 'garbage', 'overnight', 'think', 'began', 'run', 'out', 'fairly', 'plausible', 'parts', 'came', 'up', 'progressively', 'less', 'less', 'believable', 'ones', 'place', 'culminated', 'plot', 'line', 'where', 'hotel', 'staff', 'decided', 'play', 'role', 'SWAT', 'team', 'deal', 'hostage', 'situation', 'one', 'rooms', 'when', 'compare', 'better', 'story-lines', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'really', 'notice', 'qualitative', 'drop.I', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'watching', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Season', '4', 'decline', 'pretty', 'much', 'intensified', 'youngish', 'hotel', 'manager', 'who', 'replaced', 'Max', 'end', 'Season', '3', 'vanishing', 'trace', 'when', 'read', 'Anna', 'who', 'up', 'beginning', 'season', 'very', 'pregnant', 'explanation', 'show', 'third', 'episode', 'interest', 'watching', 'dropped', 'even', 'further', 'when', 'add', 'fact', 'Season', '4', 'ends', 'cliffhanger', 'show', 'cancellation', 'unresolved', 'real', 'put', 'off.But', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'Hotel', 'Babylon', 'made', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'similar', 'shows', 'Grand', 'maybe', 'production', 'company', 'will', 'decide', 'do', 'reunion', 'movie', 'sort', 'did', 'abruptly', 'canceled', 'Farscape', 'science', 'fiction', 'series', 'dangling', 'plot', 'threads', 'out', ""'m"", 'not', 'confident', 'will', 'happen']",Hotel Babylon: Season 3

1215623,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,B001LPWGHI,R.A. McKenzie,"[2, 2]","I closed my review of Season Two with, ""I can't wait for Season Three to reach the States.""  Sadly, I think I have to take those words back.There's nothing inherently wrong with this 3rd season.  It's just that, it's nothing that you didn't experience from Seasons 1 & 2.  Simply put, the plots (as breezy and energetic as they are) aren't interesting enough to pull me through.  Worse though is the cast changes that occur mid-season.The performances are fine, with each actor giving their all (although Emma Pearson's Anna can be really tough to sit through sometimes).  But they have nothing interesting to do?  The romantic relationships get a bit more complicated, but it doesn't feel natural.  I always worry when TV shows spice things up this way, because it always feels like the writers don't trust their product.  I mean, among all the craziness in this 5-star hotel, why must I watch the series regulars flirt around?Season Three is going to be notorious among series' fans for when two favorite cast members left the show.  I won't say who leaves, and I won't speculate to the real-life reasons for this.  All I'll say is that while it's handled relatively well, it definitely left an unforunate mark for the last few episodes.  The new additions to the cast are decent enough, particularly with Alexandra Moen's Emily being introduced in a mysterious fashion.  But once two lead actors leave the show, the remaining beloved characters can only do so much.I suppose the cast changes weren't going to be the only problems with this 3rd season, as a couple of ideas from previous seasons are repeated, most notably a wedding scenario and a violent hostage situation.  And as much as I love plot twists and surprises, it'd be nice if ""Hotel Babylon"" would try letting stories progress naturally, without the need to spice up everything.  I know I'm contradicting what I loved so much about Season 1 & 2, but this show needs to try slowing down once in a while.Season Three isn't a bad season, but there's no reason that you should go out of your way to watch it.  It's more of the same, which is great news for diehard fans, and sad news for viewers who've tired of the constant escapism.  I recommend renting it or using Netflix (which currently has the UK-exclusive Season Four) rather than buying this one.
