916245,A1ARQYFYXAL4I,B0009XFISM,bonsai chicken,"[5, 5]","OMEN concerns three young graphic designers (played by Thai boy band D2B) who each make the acquaintance of three very different women on the same night while driving home from work: a child street seller with impressive sleight of hand skills, a young woman who is opening a coffee shop in the noisiest part of town, and an old woman who offers cryptic warnings that gradually increase in seriousness until a death is predicted.The front cover of the DVD mentions that this film is from the Pang Brothers, who gave us THE EYE.  However, it was not directed by them and except for some flashback sequences shows none of the style that that film did.  They did write this one, but the story is also not very interesting for the most part.  It drags on a bit even for an 83 minute film.  The dialogue is uninspired and even annoying.Also prominently featured on the package is a blurb from Asian Cult Cinema proclaiming ""one of the weirdest and most inventive twist endings in years.""  This time the cover does not mislead; it is a great ending and of the sort I can't remember seeing anywhere else.  It's surprising and even deeply touching, but it feels like it has nothing to do with anything that came before it.  The predictions are explained, but it seems contrived, unless you believe that minor incidents are doomed to repeat themselves.Taking into account the ending, OMEN is an okay supernatural thriller - not a horror film as the inaccurate back cover summary strongly implies.  There isn't a scary bone in its body; it's more of a weird mystery.  It's just a shame that the brilliant last ten minutes couldn't have been attached to something more involving.",3,Predictions,1123891200,"08 13, 2005",2005,1668,"['OMEN', 'concerns', 'three', 'young', 'graphic', 'designers', 'played', 'Thai', 'boy', 'band', 'D2B', 'who', 'make', 'acquaintance', 'three', 'very', 'different', 'women', 'same', 'night', 'driving', 'home', 'work', 'child', 'street', 'seller', 'impressive', 'sleight', 'hand', 'skills', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'opening', 'coffee', 'shop', 'noisiest', 'part', 'town', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'cryptic', 'warnings', 'gradually', 'increase', 'seriousness', 'death', 'predicted.The', 'front', 'cover', 'DVD', 'mentions', 'film', 'Pang', 'Brothers', 'who', 'gave', 'THE', 'EYE', 'However', 'was', 'not', 'directed', 'except', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'none', 'style', 'film', 'did', 'did', 'write', 'one', 'story', 'also', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'most', 'part', 'bit', 'even', '83', 'minute', 'film', 'dialogue', 'uninspired', 'even', 'annoying.Also', 'prominently', 'featured', 'package', 'blurb', 'Asian', 'Cult', 'Cinema', 'proclaiming', 'one', 'weirdest', 'most', 'inventive', 'twist', 'endings', 'years', 'time', 'cover', 'not', 'mislead', 'great', 'ending', 'sort', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'seeing', 'anywhere', 'else', 'surprising', 'even', 'deeply', 'touching', 'nothing', 'do', 'anything', 'came', 'predictions', 'are', 'explained', 'contrived', 'believe', 'minor', 'incidents', 'are', 'doomed', 'repeat', 'themselves.Taking', 'account', 'ending', 'OMEN', 'okay', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'not', 'horror', 'film', 'inaccurate', 'back', 'cover', 'summary', 'strongly', 'implies', ""n't"", 'scary', 'bone', 'body', 'more', 'weird', 'mystery', 'just', 'shame', 'brilliant', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'attached', 'something', 'more', 'involving']",Omen

916247,A3G8TCCHNY4CUC,B0009XFISM,"Flickhead ""former film critic for KLSX""","[3, 4]","I received an advance screener of the US DVD of this title. What an amazing surprise! A very personal film that was well acted, realistic and suspenseful, without ever becoming unbelievable. Without giving away too much, I have to say that I was blown away by the ending -my sister even cried! The story concerns three lifelong friends (played by Thai pop group D2B, who are apparently the Thai N*Sync) who've started their own graphic design firm. One of them is involved in a mysterious car crash and finds himself in the presence of an old woman, a soothsayer, who can seemingly predict the future. Her ""omens"" (hence the title OMEN) at first seem to warn the boys, allowing them to alter their fates, but more sinister happenings threaten their friendship (and their lives) when a girl enters the picture. The film has rich character development - way more than I've come to expect from Hollywood movies, and the plot intertwines Thai superstitions with spiritual issues like reincarnation, and many other paranormal anomalies that create a very creepy atmosphere. The DVD has a ton of features, including trailers, band bios, still galleries, and essays; according to one such essay, one of the actors had a real near-death experience after the film finished, and there is a tribute to him from his fan club on the disc. I was able to find two Easter eggs in the menus, too. One of them is a great Behind-the-Scenes documentary with interviews with the cast and Danny and Oxide Pang. Really cool packaging, too. I can't remember the last time I received such a pleasant surprise.",5,Another excellent film from the Pang Brothers!,1120089600,"06 30, 2005",2005,1584,"['received', 'advance', 'screener', 'US', 'DVD', 'title', 'What', 'amazing', 'surprise', 'very', 'personal', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'realistic', 'suspenseful', 'ever', 'becoming', 'unbelievable', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'ending', '-my', 'sister', 'even', 'cried', 'story', 'concerns', 'three', 'lifelong', 'friends', 'played', 'Thai', 'pop', 'group', 'D2B', 'who', 'are', 'apparently', 'Thai', 'N*Sync', 'who', ""'ve"", 'started', 'own', 'graphic', 'design', 'firm', 'One', 'involved', 'mysterious', 'car', 'crash', 'presence', 'old', 'woman', 'soothsayer', 'who', 'can', 'seemingly', 'predict', 'future', 'omens', 'hence', 'title', 'OMEN', 'first', 'seem', 'warn', 'boys', 'allowing', 'alter', 'fates', 'more', 'sinister', 'happenings', 'threaten', 'friendship', 'lives', 'when', 'girl', 'picture', 'film', 'rich', 'character', 'development', 'way', 'more', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'plot', 'intertwines', 'Thai', 'superstitions', 'spiritual', 'issues', 'reincarnation', 'many', 'other', 'paranormal', 'anomalies', 'create', 'very', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'DVD', 'ton', 'features', 'including', 'trailers', 'band', 'bios', 'still', 'galleries', 'essays', 'according', 'one', 'such', 'essay', 'one', 'actors', 'had', 'real', 'near-death', 'experience', 'film', 'finished', 'tribute', 'fan', 'club', 'disc', 'was', 'able', 'find', 'two', 'Easter', 'eggs', 'menus', 'too', 'One', 'great', 'Behind-the-Scenes', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'cast', 'Danny', 'Oxide', 'Pang', 'Really', 'cool', 'packaging', 'too', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'received', 'pleasant', 'surprise']",Omen

This film is not pure horror.. I consider it a supernatural suspense film with a slice of romance.  As with other Pang Bros films, the film is well paced and sets up several surprises.  According to the DVD website this DVD is really loaded with special features and includes a bunch of stuff on D2B including interviews with them as well as the Pang Bros.  I think it's great to see new Thai films appreciated in such a way.  Thai Cinema is better then most people know!!!!  Check it out and see for yourself what the Pang Bros can do.

It helps tremndously to have some familiarity with Asian cultures, and philosophies. If you have this, then the movie works brilliantly!I won't spoil anything, in fact I won't say much. But, the twist ending works, and is inspired (again, it helps to know certain aspects of Asian culture). The surprises actually work, and the performances are very good. It's hard to give proper praise without ruining anything, but really pay attention and things will unfold in a delicately balanced way that delivers a satisfying, even touching story. And, I must add, this may be the epitome of suspension of disbelief, because in the end it makes a certain sense, and works, though you wouldn't believe it if you heard it.If you haven't seen many asian films, this one may be hard to digest at first, but for the experienced, this one is fantastic!
