This is the Olsen Twins very first movie and they didn't do a bad job. They runaway to visit their grandma and get kidnapped by two crooks. Their mother is worried sick about them and Eddy is in love with their mom. The reason they runaway is because they want to give their mother a vacation from motherhood for Christmas. Instead it gives their mother, (Ronda) and Eddy the thrill of a life time trying to find her daughtors. After they meet once again they become closer and Eddy and Ronda fall in love. The movie even has Bob Saget who is Danny Tanner from Full House, Lori Loughlin who plays Rebbecca Donaldson/Katsopolis from Full House, Candace Cameron/Bure who is D.J.
