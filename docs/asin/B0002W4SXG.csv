This season really began to develop the characters in earnest : Topanga became less hippy and more smart though assertive, Shawn became the troubled, but loveable and loyal best friend. Eric devolved into a little bit more goofy though more serious than his later seasons work and Feeny evolved into the stern though prideful principal who could both lay down the law and offer just the slightest few compassionate drops to his students. The extras include more DVD commentaries with Michael Jacobs and usually two cast members which is a big improvement over the first season where they had like five people doing commentary and it got a little messy.
