No. No you don't.I've been using gift cards to buy my animes, and I had some money left over from my last purchase. I was just a FEW CENTS away from being able to get this because it had cost 2 dollars something cents plus 3.99 shipping, but it dropped in price to .50 cents plus 3.99 shipping and I was able to afford four Pokemon movies for such an amazingly cheap price!! I'm positively thrilled. I hope that nothing was wrong with it or something... if it was sold for so cheap, you can't help but be paranoid, you know?EDIT: The disk seems okay, and the coverart is awesome but MAN! This dvd was obviously not kept well. You have no idea how dirty it was! I thought it was messed up beyond repair!! I won't rate this any lower thoguh (there should seriosuly be two ratings on amazon: one for the product when it was recieved, and one for giving many stars to the show you love on dvds). Many people end up rating something super low because even thoguh they loved the series, the product they got was bad.

1433140,A23Y7C8U1JZ20G,B004YCKJVA,Ray,"[8, 11]","I bought this ""collection"" from my local Target store for only $4.99 thinking I was getting a bargain, which I did. I had no problem with the DVD case or cover/back art either, it wasn't fantastic but what can you really ask for? I opened my copy a few hours after getting home with it to find that its just a plain, literally no disc artwork, NOTHING disc that contains all 4 of the movies listed that it comes with on ONE double sided disc. I honestly didn't care for this, at least slap some god damn artwork on the disc to make it look a little bit less like a bootleg/the cheap release it really is.I'm a huge Pokemon fan, and instead of paying $10+ dollars for each of these movies I won't lie, its easily a better deal to just settle for this, and trust me when I say SETTLE for this. All 4 of these movies (as far as I know) are out of print so finding them new in the original 2003-2007 releases could prove to be an issue and if you just wanna complete your collection or just have all of these movie like me, a classic long time fan of the old series back when 4Kids was doing their version of the dub and not the terrible Pokemon USA dub that is released these days.OVERALL: If you are looking for an absolutely bare-bones, no inserts, no extras, no disc art, double sided release for all 4 of these movies this is the product for you. If you are looking for the original extras (Suicune card, Pikachu Shorts, Inserts, etc) then have a nice time trying to find those new and unopened. My only advice is to check your local Toys R Us, Wal-Mart or Target before placing an order for this online. I found mine for $4.99 at my local Target down the street like I said and I was pretty pleased (again, settling) for what I paid.. in the end it comes down to can you settle for less? If yes, buy. If no, search for the original releases.",3,Boring release overall,1329350400,"02 16, 2012",2012,1843,"['bought', 'collection', 'local', 'Target', 'store', 'only', '4.99', 'thinking', 'was', 'getting', 'bargain', 'did', 'had', 'problem', 'DVD', 'case', 'cover/back', 'art', 'was', ""n't"", 'fantastic', 'what', 'can', 'really', 'ask', 'opened', 'copy', 'few', 'hours', 'getting', 'home', 'find', 'just', 'plain', 'literally', 'disc', 'artwork', 'NOTHING', '4', 'movies', 'listed', 'ONE', 'double', 'sided', 'disc', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'least', 'slap', 'god', 'damn', 'artwork', 'disc', 'make', 'look', 'little', 'bit', 'less', 'bootleg/the', 'cheap', 'release', 'really', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Pokemon', 'fan', 'instead', 'paying', '10+', 'dollars', 'movies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lie', 'easily', 'better', 'deal', 'just', 'settle', 'trust', 'when', 'say', 'SETTLE', '4', 'movies', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'are', 'print', 'so', 'finding', 'new', 'original', '2003-2007', 'releases', 'could', 'prove', 'be', 'issue', 'just', 'wan', 'na', 'complete', 'collection', 'just', 'have', 'movie', 'classic', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'old', 'series', 'back', 'when', '4Kids', 'was', 'doing', 'version', 'dub', 'not', 'terrible', 'Pokemon', 'USA', 'dub', 'released', 'days.OVERALL', 'are', 'looking', 'absolutely', 'bare-bones', 'inserts', 'extras', 'disc', 'art', 'double', 'sided', 'release', '4', 'movies', 'product', 'are', 'looking', 'original', 'extras', 'Suicune', 'card', 'Pikachu', 'Shorts', 'Inserts', 'etc', 'then', 'have', 'nice', 'time', 'trying', 'find', 'new', 'unopened', 'only', 'advice', 'check', 'local', 'Toys', 'R', 'Us', 'Wal-Mart', 'Target', 'placing', 'order', 'online', 'found', 'mine', '4.99', 'local', 'Target', 'street', 'said', 'was', 'pretty', 'pleased', 'again', 'settling', 'what', 'paid..', 'end', 'down', 'can', 'settle', 'less', 'yes', 'buy', 'search', 'original', 'releases']",Pokemon Collector's Set: Pokemon Heroes / Pokemon 4Ever / Pokemon: Destiny Deoxys / Pokemon Jirachi: Wish Maker
