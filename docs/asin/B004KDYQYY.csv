1412208,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B004KDYQYY,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[0, 0]","Luke Perry has a thing for westerns. His first western-themed picture--8 seconds (1994) was a flop though. The accent and the concept were 'off' who he was even in real life. He did not know how to play the scriptObviously not one to give up, Luke was undeterred. He read for a western which he could convincingly portray, and partnered with a  long-time friend (who apparently knew how his mind worked). for directing.John Goodnight grew up to be a lawyer after having seen his parents murdered when he is a little boy. Becoming burnt out and disillusioned, he gets appointed a circuit judge. This surprise career change reinvigorates him--and sends him on all sorts of adventures around in frontier Wyoming.In addition to property cases and martial disputes, the judge deals with more serious issues of race and sexuality. I'm certain this scripting is is 'modern'. Yes, the African Americans sit (like in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"") in the balcony.The young man is visibly shocked that Goodnight shares the same cup with him. He initially suspects it might be poisoned. Other people in the town, such as a pompous real-estate owner make no secret that they don't like 'different' kinds, so our smart-alec judge really stick out. Being a judge can be dangerous too!Other parts of the film seem both dramatic and unrealistic--Goodnight pretends to lynch a white man who had mistreated African Americans, refuses to convict a showgirl who self-defends herself against assault, and supports Indian property rights. I do have a hard time believing that a frontier judge would have done all this. It does make an action-packed screenplay and Luke is awesome as the Wild West superhero  but it's not entirely realistic. Not by a long shot.  Attempting to avenge his parents murder, and clean things up, he almost morphs into Batman in the wild west when dealing with cases/people which he's not entirely fond of. The obviously gruelling work revitalizes him from the slacker lawyer we see at the begining of the screen play. Now he actually has to work and think to get things done, and keep his own tail intact.Parts of the screenplay also reminded me of Doc Hollywood: a big shot searches for and finds his inner peace--and an unconventional girlfriend--where he is not expecting it. And since it's Luke Perry, there are some kissing scenes in here. He's a couple of years older now--but still in great shape (the shirtless scenes).The parts about this woman's father and the necklace WERE just completely stupid.  Luke and Jason could have done something else other than throw these lines in to obviously fill up screen space. I still think she's Amy Acker's long lost twin because she even has the accent.  I wish that Lara Gilchrist had a more substantial plot line in this movie. They did not really know what to do with her once she had been introduced in the screenplay. Make her a schoolteacher or community leader (Wyoming gave women the right to vote first) other than flirt with Luke and sew him up after an injury.",4,Justifiably Good,1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,3020,"['Luke', 'Perry', 'thing', 'westerns', 'first', 'western-themed', 'picture', '8', 'seconds', '1994', 'was', 'flop', 'though', 'accent', 'concept', 'were', ""'off"", 'who', 'was', 'even', 'real', 'life', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'play', 'scriptObviously', 'not', 'one', 'give', 'up', 'Luke', 'was', 'undeterred', 'read', 'western', 'could', 'convincingly', 'portray', 'partnered', 'long-time', 'friend', 'who', 'apparently', 'knew', 'how', 'mind', 'worked', 'directing.John', 'Goodnight', 'grew', 'up', 'be', 'lawyer', 'having', 'seen', 'parents', 'murdered', 'when', 'little', 'boy', 'Becoming', 'burnt', 'out', 'disillusioned', 'appointed', 'circuit', 'judge', 'surprise', 'career', 'change', 'sorts', 'adventures', 'frontier', 'Wyoming.In', 'addition', 'property', 'cases', 'martial', 'disputes', 'judge', 'deals', 'more', 'serious', 'issues', 'race', 'sexuality', ""'m"", 'certain', 'scripting', ""'modern"", 'Yes', 'African', 'Americans', 'sit', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'balcony.The', 'young', 'man', 'visibly', 'shocked', 'Goodnight', 'shares', 'same', 'cup', 'initially', 'might', 'be', 'poisoned', 'Other', 'people', 'town', 'such', 'pompous', 'real-estate', 'owner', 'make', 'secret', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', ""'different"", 'kinds', 'smart-alec', 'judge', 'really', 'stick', 'out', 'Being', 'judge', 'can', 'be', 'dangerous', 'too', 'Other', 'parts', 'film', 'seem', 'dramatic', 'unrealistic', 'Goodnight', 'lynch', 'white', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'mistreated', 'African', 'Americans', 'convict', 'showgirl', 'who', 'assault', 'Indian', 'property', 'rights', 'do', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'frontier', 'judge', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'make', 'action-packed', 'screenplay', 'Luke', 'awesome', 'Wild', 'West', 'superhero', 'not', 'entirely', 'realistic', 'Not', 'long', 'shot', 'Attempting', 'avenge', 'parents', 'murder', 'clean', 'things', 'up', 'almost', 'morphs', 'Batman', 'wild', 'west', 'when', 'dealing', 'cases/people', 'not', 'entirely', 'fond', 'obviously', 'gruelling', 'work', 'slacker', 'lawyer', 'see', 'begining', 'screen', 'play', 'Now', 'actually', 'work', 'think', 'get', 'things', 'done', 'keep', 'own', 'tail', 'intact.Parts', 'screenplay', 'also', 'reminded', 'Doc', 'Hollywood', 'big', 'shot', 'searches', 'inner', 'peace', 'unconventional', 'girlfriend', 'where', 'not', 'expecting', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'are', 'kissing', 'scenes', 'here', 'couple', 'years', 'older', 'now', 'still', 'great', 'shape', 'shirtless', 'scenes', '.The', 'parts', 'woman', 'father', 'necklace', 'WERE', 'just', 'completely', 'stupid', 'Luke', 'Jason', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'else', 'other', 'throw', 'lines', 'obviously', 'fill', 'up', 'screen', 'space', 'still', 'think', 'Amy', 'Acker', 'long', 'lost', 'twin', 'even', 'accent', 'wish', 'Lara', 'Gilchrist', 'had', 'more', 'substantial', 'plot', 'line', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'once', 'had', 'been', 'introduced', 'screenplay', 'Make', 'schoolteacher', 'community', 'leader', 'Wyoming', 'gave', 'women', 'right', 'vote', 'first', 'other', 'flirt', 'Luke', 'sew', 'up', 'injury']",Goodnight for Justice

After returning to a town that brings back memories of his parents murders, he sees someone who looks familiar.  After seeing the last two TV westerns (Doc West & Triggerman) I was not expecting much from this one.  Although this was nowhere near the caliber of ""Tombstone"" or ""Open Range"", this was actually a pretty good western.  It is pretty cheesy in some parts and the acting is lacking, but it will keep you entertained and watching.  Unlike the ""Doc West"" series this one will hold your attention and you won't forget what you are watching as you are watching it.

1412212,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B004KDYQYY,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[9, 9]","I watched this film with trepidation, as it appeared Charles Goodnight's life was to be reinvented, making him a hard-fightin' crusader for justice. (Goodnight's name has been whitewashed over the years. He was actually a agro-capitalist murderer.)Turns out the film's principal character is fictional, one John William Goodnight, a hard-drinking lawyer. The story gets off to a bad start, portraying him as an amusing-and-not-very-serious roughneck. This is corrected as we learn his Batman-ish backstory, and he's made a circuit judge serving the area where his parents were murdered, in the hope he'll not only dispense tough justice, but exorcise his demons.Not surprisingly, the story comprises mostly clich&eacute;s, especially the one of projecting 20th-century liberal values on 19th-century characters. But the sober, believable dialog, and everyone's (including the director's) underplaying largely suppresses the ""I've seen this a hundred times before"" reaction. The slight twist at the end isn't much of a surprise, but the murderer's motivations are unexpected and surprisingly cruel -- decidedly John Meston-ish.Given that Luke Perry is credited with creating the character, and the story's lack of a conventional romantic resolution, it would seem Mr Perry has a series of films in mind. (A check of IMDb indicates two more films are ""in the hopper"".) Perry is not only a competent actor, but he's appealing dressed -- and even more appealing dis-habille. The visual clich&eacute; of the nude man in the wash basin is trotted out, with Perry pushing it to the limit of acceptability for a film children might see. Nevertheless, this is a PG-13 film not suitable for pre-teens (despite some reviewers calling it a ""family"" film).""Goodnight for Justice"" is light entertainment, but well-done. That's why I'm giving it a positive, four-star review.",4,definitely above-average,1312588800,"08 6, 2011",2011,1860,"['watched', 'film', 'trepidation', 'appeared', 'Charles', 'Goodnight', 'life', 'was', 'be', 'reinvented', 'making', 'hard-fightin', 'crusader', 'justice', 'Goodnight', 'name', 'been', 'whitewashed', 'years', 'was', 'actually', 'agro-capitalist', 'murderer', 'out', 'film', 'principal', 'character', 'fictional', 'one', 'John', 'William', 'Goodnight', 'hard-drinking', 'lawyer', 'story', 'bad', 'start', 'portraying', 'amusing-and-not-very-serious', 'roughneck', 'corrected', 'learn', 'Batman-ish', 'backstory', 'made', 'circuit', 'judge', 'serving', 'area', 'where', 'parents', 'were', 'murdered', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'not', 'only', 'dispense', 'tough', 'justice', 'exorcise', 'demons.Not', 'surprisingly', 'story', 'mostly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'especially', 'one', 'projecting', '20th-century', 'liberal', 'values', '19th-century', 'characters', 'sober', 'believable', 'dialog', 'everyone', 'including', 'director', 'underplaying', 'largely', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hundred', 'times', 'reaction', 'slight', 'twist', 'end', ""n't"", 'much', 'surprise', 'murderer', 'motivations', 'are', 'unexpected', 'surprisingly', 'cruel', 'decidedly', 'John', 'Meston-ish.Given', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'credited', 'creating', 'character', 'story', 'lack', 'conventional', 'romantic', 'resolution', 'would', 'seem', 'Mr', 'Perry', 'series', 'films', 'mind', 'check', 'IMDb', 'two', 'more', 'films', 'are', 'hopper', 'Perry', 'not', 'only', 'competent', 'actor', 'appealing', 'dressed', 'even', 'more', 'appealing', 'dis-habille', 'visual', 'clich', 'eacute', 'nude', 'man', 'wash', 'basin', 'trotted', 'out', 'Perry', 'pushing', 'limit', 'acceptability', 'film', 'children', 'might', 'see', 'Nevertheless', 'PG-13', 'film', 'not', 'suitable', 'pre-teens', 'reviewers', 'calling', 'family', 'film', 'Goodnight', 'Justice', 'light', 'entertainment', 'well-done', 'why', ""'m"", 'giving', 'positive', 'four-star', 'review']",Goodnight for Justice
