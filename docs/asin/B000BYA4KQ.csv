952644,A32T2H8150OJLU,B000BYA4KQ,ARH,"[0, 0]","Chase, Hines, and Weaver headline this late cold-war era dark comedy, where arms dealers are scrabbling to sell contracts to the US govt. as well as to insurgents, repressive regimes, or anyone else with cash in hand.Chase is a small time independent arms dealer who spends his time in backwater areas nonchalantly strolling amidst rebellions, supplying guerilla groups, etc.  Hines is his partner who stays home, preps and repairs arms for shipping, and finds God.  Weaver is the wife of a salesman from a military tech company who, well, you have to watch to see what happens to him.  Sure enough, pretty soon their paths cross with the possibility of ""The Deal of the Century"" looming just beyond their grasp.I have to say that I can't really believe that I watched the whole thing.  I mean, I guess I watched it in the hopes that it would eventually get good, or even have some funny bits.  OK, maybe there were about 2, maybe 3 scenes that made me grin, well, half a grin, but nothing made me laugh.  This was noFunny FarmorCaddyshack,All in all, this was only a mediocre offering.  Sure the special effects were dated, but that's not why this show gets only 3 stars.  It just wasn't that good.  The pace and storyline dragged constantly.3 stars, because it was only ""OK""",3,"Only average...not enough humor for a comedy, or even for a satisfying parody/spoof",1310688000,"07 15, 2011",2011,1276,"['Chase', 'Hines', 'Weaver', 'headline', 'late', 'cold-war', 'era', 'dark', 'comedy', 'where', 'arms', 'dealers', 'are', 'scrabbling', 'sell', 'contracts', 'US', 'govt', 'as', 'well', 'insurgents', 'repressive', 'regimes', 'anyone', 'else', 'cash', 'hand.Chase', 'small', 'time', 'independent', 'arms', 'dealer', 'who', 'time', 'backwater', 'areas', 'nonchalantly', 'strolling', 'amidst', 'rebellions', 'supplying', 'guerilla', 'groups', 'etc', 'Hines', 'partner', 'who', 'home', 'preps', 'repairs', 'arms', 'shipping', 'God', 'wife', 'salesman', 'military', 'tech', 'company', 'who', 'well', 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'what', 'Sure', 'enough', 'pretty', 'soon', 'paths', 'cross', 'possibility', 'Deal', 'Century', 'looming', 'just', 'grasp.I', 'have', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'believe', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'mean', 'guess', 'watched', 'hopes', 'would', 'eventually', 'get', 'good', 'even', 'have', 'funny', 'bits', 'OK', 'maybe', 'were', '2', 'maybe', '3', 'scenes', 'made', 'grin', 'well', 'grin', 'nothing', 'made', 'laugh', 'was', 'noFunny', 'FarmorCaddyshack', 'All', 'was', 'only', 'mediocre', 'offering', 'Sure', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'dated', 'not', 'why', 'show', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'pace', 'storyline', 'dragged', 'constantly.3', 'stars', 'was', 'only', 'OK']",N/A

Moberg,"[0, 0]","A South American dictator in full military dress regalia makes a public announcement that his citizenry is going to be taxed to provide for new military equipment and also that women who work for the government shall not be henceforth allowed to wear pants.  Later he makes a pass at Sigourney Weaver who wears pants better than most.  Interestingly, God is not mocked in this movie, and a baptism scene with Gregory Hines is so tenderly done that it will probably be enough to get this star into heaven!  Only an arms manufacturer has no internal conflict with the advanced weapon he makes and tries to sell; otherwise, all these characters undergo character transformations that, in most cases, are for the better.  Herein likes the high-star rating.  Peoples' lives improve; sex-scenes are portrayed symbolically by weapons rather than people; and except for one scene where helicopters attack army gorillas, not many get killed--and this is pretty good for a war weapons movie!  There are dozens of instances of where clever things are said or demonstrated, and this is tribute to screenwriting from over twenty years ago (Paul Brickman).  During the movie I actually laughed more than once, so it was pretty darned good.  Admittedly I bought it as a used video and not the DVD, but comparing to other films from its era, this one is great.  Thank you, Warner Bros.",5,It made me laugh.

This is not a comedy, and the suspense is minimal.Before I saw the movie, I read a review saying it contained an unnecessary story line about a born again Christian.  I held my breath to see how my faith would be mocked in this film.  To my surprise, this movie contains one of the best portrayals of a Christian.  Gregory Hines did an excellent job in that role, and except for one scene that came across as a caricature of a Christian, it was respectful.One scene was masterful.  It showed Hines trying to be patient in dealing with a jerk, before he finally responded by pulling out a flame thrower and torching the assailant's car.  And then you immediately see the remorse and sorrow at his own sinful reaction.However, this is mixed in with normal Hollywood garbage.  There is a swimming pool baptism scene side by side with a swimming pool sex scene (different characters).I'm not sure what this movie wanted to be, but whatever it was, it failed.",3,"This Movie Contains The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly -- Too Bad That Title's Been Used!",1170115200,"01 30, 2007",2007,1049,"['When', 'saw', 'preview', 'came', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'comedy', 'plenty', 'tension', 'not', 'comedy', 'suspense', 'minimal.Before', 'saw', 'movie', 'read', 'review', 'saying', 'contained', 'unnecessary', 'story', 'line', 'born', 'again', 'Christian', 'held', 'breath', 'see', 'how', 'faith', 'would', 'be', 'mocked', 'film', 'surprise', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'portrayals', 'Christian', 'Gregory', 'Hines', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'role', 'one', 'scene', 'came', 'caricature', 'Christian', 'was', 'respectful.One', 'scene', 'was', 'masterful', 'showed', 'Hines', 'trying', 'be', 'patient', 'dealing', 'jerk', 'finally', 'responded', 'pulling', 'out', 'flame', 'thrower', 'torching', 'assailant', 'car', 'then', 'immediately', 'see', 'remorse', 'sorrow', 'own', 'sinful', 'reaction.However', 'mixed', 'normal', 'Hollywood', 'garbage', 'swimming', 'pool', 'baptism', 'scene', 'side', 'side', 'swimming', 'pool', 'sex', 'scene', 'different', 'characters', '.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'movie', 'wanted', 'be', 'whatever', 'was', 'failed']",N/A
952647,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B000BYA4KQ,Jeffrey Leach,"[13, 14]","A film student could probably write a doctoral dissertation on Chevy Chase's convoluted movie career. Once considered the most promising cast member on a nascent Saturday Night Live, Chase was one of the first from that show to make an exodus into major motion pictures. His initial efforts boded well for the future. One can still watch films like ""Foul Play,"" ""Caddyshack,"" and ""Seems Like Old Times"" and laugh at this comedian's brilliant ability to garner laughs. In his early career, Chase stayed true to his comedic stylings--namely relying on his deadpan delivery, his embrace of the inane and ridiculous, and his marvelous skill at throwing out brilliant lines that are still quotable today. Even when his career turned south, his best movies always incorporated the traits listed above. ""Fletch,"" the first and third installment of the National Lampoon Vacation films, and ""Funny Farm"" worked because Chase stayed close to his roots. His career foundered because he tried to leave this reservation. ""Modern Problems,"" ""The Three Amigos,"" ""Nothing But Trouble,"" and a host of other films effectively sank his career. Some would say ""Deal of the Century"" helped deal the deathblow. Maybe so, but I love this film.""Deal of the Century"" centers on Chevy Chase playing a fourth rate arms dealer named Eddie Muntz. His character sells firearms, munitions, explosives, and other military gear in every third world hot spot on the planet. When we first meet Eddie, he's trying to wrap up a deal with a band of revolutionaries in some Central American toilet. Just when the money comes through, the government arrives on the scene and starts shooting. Muntz loses his money, loses his hardware, and receives a bullet in the foot for his troubles. Limping back to his fleabag hotel in defeat, he happens to run across a frantic Harold DeVoto (Wallace Shawn) in the next room over. This guy's going nuts waiting for a phone call that will seal a multi-million dollar deal involving an experimental aircraft called the Peacemaker. Muntz talks the guy down, leaves the room, and has to run back in when he hears a gunshot. DeVoto couldn't take the pressure waiting for that phone to ring, which it does a few seconds after DeVoto put the gun to his head. Now Eddie Muntz assumes a new identity--salesman for the Peacemaker--as he tries to make his own deal of the century.As the movie progresses, we meet Muntz's partner Ray Kasternak (Gregory Hines), a former fighter pilot turned arms merchant who's starting to have second thoughts of a decidedly religious nature about selling death to poor countries. We also meet DeVoto's wife Catherine (Sigourney Weaver), a woman drifting into Eddie's orbit after she discovers that he's trying to steal her late husband's deal. The three agree to pitch in together so they can make the sell and walk away multi-millionaires. Problems soon ensue, not the least of which revolve around a sleazy third world despot named General Cordosa (William Marquez). He keeps stonewalling Muntz and company about the sale. In the end, he demands a very special favor before he'll shell out the big bucks. Another difficulty involves basket case Frank Stryker (Vince Edwards), an executive at the arms factory that makes the Peacemaker. Closely related to Stryker's vitriolic rages are the mechanical problems plaguing the aircraft. Everything comes to a head at a huge weapons expo at the end of the movie. Will Eddie seal the deal? Will Ray reconcile his newly found belief in Christ with his career as a death merchant? Watch the movie and find out!I can't help but love this movie. I know many hate it, but I think it's got a lot of things going for it. Director William Friedkin tried to make both a comedy and a serious political satire about the arms race with ""Deal of the Century,"" and for the most part both pieces work well. Some of the satire is heavy-handed, i.e. the stock footage of missiles firing when Catherine's working her magic with General Cordosa, but it's still interesting to watch. The outright humor is more effective. Chase gets a lot of neat dialogue to work with, which he fires off in that deadpan style fans love, and he has several memorable scenes that stay with the viewer long after the credits roll. I love the scene when he pulls an assault rifle on a street thug trying to rob him, or when he's demonstrating a rocket launcher in a hotel room. The line he throws out when he first meets Catherine--""What's a place like this doing wrapped around a girl like you?""--rates high as one of my favorite Chevy Chase quotes (I hope I got it right. If not, I'll hear about it). Perhaps the best sequence in the film doesn't even involve Chase. It's a scene centering on Ray, a car accident, and a flamethrower. Good stuff.Sadly, the only extra on the disc is a trailer for the film. We do get a nice widescreen picture transfer and decent audio. Obviously, I'd like a commentary track, but I'm just happy the movie finally made the trek to DVD. I'm going to give ""Deal of the Century"" five solid stars. It might not achieve the Olympian heights of ""Vacation,"" ""Fletch,"" and a few other Chevy Chase classics, but it's always been a personal favorite of mine ever since I used to watch it on cable television back in the early 1980s during my summer breaks from school. If you're new to Chase's wacky brand of humor, I'd recommend starting out with one of his better-known pictures. Only when you learn to appreciate his wicked style should you migrate to this film. And when you finally make the trip, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",5,A personal favorite,1179014400,"05 13, 2007",2007,5590,"['film', 'student', 'could', 'probably', 'write', 'doctoral',
