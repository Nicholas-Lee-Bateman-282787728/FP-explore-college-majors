1072855,A1TGFSOCP14HKA,B000PSTGDE,Nina L W,"[0, 0]",I was amazed at the depth and feeling of this movie on forgiveness of this story.  The fact that it is a true story is amazing what Bruce did.  I wonder if anyone else would have done such a thing.  I would like to think they might but it would take a very big man (on the inside) to carry it out.  Dean Cain did a fantastic performance and should have won an award for it.,5,Inspiring movie,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,373,"['was', 'amazed', 'depth', 'feeling', 'movie', 'forgiveness', 'story', 'fact', 'true', 'story', 'amazing', 'what', 'Bruce', 'did', 'wonder', 'anyone', 'else', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'thing', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'might', 'would', 'take', 'very', 'big', 'man', 'inside', 'carry', 'out', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'did', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'award']",Crossroads - A Story of Forgiveness - Hallmark
1072856,A32VWXHV4FCKUL,B000PSTGDE,Old Softy,"[1, 1]","I've seen this movie twice on TV, plus I own a copy of it. It is very well made.Dean Cain does a great job of portraying Bruce Murakami, and bringing into our living rooms the emotional nightmare that this grieving husband and father was forced to experience. I also felt compassion for the young man who caused the accident, largely because the actor who played him expressed real emotions as he acted the part. The movie is very well directed, and even gives attention to the emotional distance between Bruce and his youngest son.This movie is not overdramatized. It is very ""true to life,"" as it is a presentation of a true story. Furthermore, it gives a sort of documentary background to the formation of Safe Teen Driver, the organization that Bruce founded to educate teens so that they don't make the same mistake that killed his wife and daughter.[...]Whether or not you have teenagers, this movie is worth buying. If fact, it is a great tool for teaching lessons about forgiveness, no matter what age.",5,An Incredible Story,1246406400,"07 1, 2009",2009,1010,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'twice', 'TV', 'own', 'copy', 'very', 'well', 'made.Dean', 'Cain', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'Bruce', 'Murakami', 'bringing', 'living', 'rooms', 'emotional', 'nightmare', 'grieving', 'husband', 'father', 'was', 'forced', 'experience', 'also', 'felt', 'compassion', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'caused', 'accident', 'largely', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'expressed', 'real', 'emotions', 'acted', 'part', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'directed', 'even', 'attention', 'emotional', 'distance', 'Bruce', 'youngest', 'son.This', 'movie', 'not', 'overdramatized', 'very', 'true', 'life', 'presentation', 'true', 'story', 'Furthermore', 'sort', 'documentary', 'background', 'formation', 'Safe', 'Teen', 'Driver', 'organization', 'Bruce', 'founded', 'educate', 'teens', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'same', 'mistake', 'killed', 'wife', 'daughter.', '[', 'Whether', 'not', 'have', 'teenagers', 'movie', 'worth', 'buying', 'fact', 'great', 'tool', 'teaching', 'lessons', 'forgiveness', 'matter', 'what', 'age']",Crossroads - A Story of Forgiveness - Hallmark
