I'm almost positive that chastity and virtue were much much more important and valued that this show would have you believe.The funniest line in the whole show was the last episode when Mr. selfridge clears his bad name and says, &#34;I am an honorable man&#34; and all the characters believe him. Since when has a man become honorable by committing adultery multiple times while his good wife and kids are home asleep? What about men who are highly addicted to gambling, who blame everything on their dad, who lust for money and wealth and prioritize them over family?If you like accurate period drama without a filthy soap opera story line, you are much much better off watching the Paradise.

This series is basically a small business man has an idea to make a bigger and better department store. If not for his positive and go-getter attitude, it would not happen. While I do not take it that this show is any sort of documentary, it is actually interesting to watch to see how department stores may have evolved to what they are today. After all, stores originally were just general stores with items stacked on shelves. Someone had to think of placing items in specific places, or displayed in a way to entice people to buy. One episode also had a 'sale' and some of the managers were having a problem with the concept of lowering prices just to get people to buy. They also bring in people from history to the store, in order to bring customers in to the store.Aside from that, this is another soap opera type series. So there are cheaters, lovers, haters, etc.... Personally I like the series and look forward to Season 2. Some have compared this to The Paradise. It is very similar. The 2 male characters are revolutionizing the department store, and both have a female character in it, who strive to not be just sales girls (they want to manage or own the store). But there are a lot of copycat shows out there so I guess there are room for both of these. Still I liked both Selfridge and The Paradise.

Yes, the costumes are fantastic as are the sets, but the real crux is Selfridge. Without the steamroller personification of Selfridge, it could have been a very dreary costume series and missed the fact that Selfridge had a vision and the passion to bring his vision into reality.

1573542,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B008PEHZXI,Darren,"[0, 0]","ITV's 10-part soap opera about one Harry Selfridge, an American retailer who came to London in the first decade of the 20th Century and demonstrated to the British that shopping at a department store could be high-class fun.  Among his innovations: don't treat your customers like pond scum; in fact, this is the man credited with the immortal phrase, ""The customer is always right.""  Also, he perhaps inaugurated the idea that a businessman could give his employees the sense, however fundamentally mistaken, of having autonomy at their jobs.  The real Selfridge often made a point that there was a difference between a ""boss"" and a ""leader"" -- admittedly, a distinction without much of a difference to the hoi polloi laboring under that ""leader"", but the whole ""no i-in-team"" thing was pretty revolutionary for 1910, particularly in a caste society like Great Britain.  Piven is always exhorting the staff, from the managers to the laborers, to come to him with ideas ... though a wise manager like Piven always reviews and approves or disapproves those ideas as a matter of course.  And while he encourages the managers of the store's individual ""departments"" (""Accessories"", ""Fashion"", ""Cosmetics"", ""Hardware"", and so on) to treat those departments like privately owned fiefdoms, the wise manager like Piven inevitably micromanages.  Selfridge is also apparently the man to blame for young women brandishing bottles of perfume at us whenever we walk into a department store.  (The prosaic inspiration for this?  Hiding the stench of the horse-dung on the street outside the shop.)  Selfridge also brought to the Britons the idea that you could see and touch all of the store's merchandise -- proper shopping, in other words, unlike before, when you approached a bare counter and an antagonistic salesperson and begged him or her to look at their goods one item at a time.  Finally, he perfected, even if he did not wholly invent, the grand display window that would lure potential customers into the store.  All in all, Selfridge was a brilliant innovator, and we're still living with his legacy today.  While I've never been to a Selfridge's store in the U.K., I think the apt comparison for Americans would be Nordstroms or Needless Mark-Up -- er, Neiman Marcus.Whenever ""Mr Selfridge"" shows us these ideas in action, the series shines.  It will always be of interest to see the dramatization of something that we take for granted today, like shopping at a department store, getting born.  However, this is not a documentary.  So whenever the series strays from the actual business of the shop, we get a soap opera of the lowest order.  Rather surprisingly, Piven as Selfridge is the central, but not quite the main, character.  He shares about equal time with 4 or 5 other characters who have their own arcs and shifting love interests, none of which are terribly compelling.  The main reason for this, of course, is money: these British series are always cash-poor, and therefore narratives must be constantly adjusted in view of ratings.  Can we afford to keep paying this particular actor?  No?  Then away to New York his character must go ... and thus the salesgirl who's been bedding with him must go back to the waiter ... who was rather low-brow and caveman-like at first but now must suddenly become cynical, sophisticated and ambitious, but we're going to keep HIM because the ratings were good enough last week so let's tone down his cynicism and give him some ethical scruples... but why go on?  You get the idea.  When it comes to art, money blurs consistent vision.  There have been complaints about Piven's performance as Selfridge, but I'm inclined to let that pass.  Piven's playing someone who, even in private, feels he must perform the role of Big Man.  This leads to a weird-to-us performance, but one that is actually pretty consistent with the sort of Master of the Universe type that Selfridge undoubtedly was.  Piven's awkward phrasing and phony presentation fits the role.  In any case, I greatly enjoyed seeing people like Frances O'Connor and Ron Cook turn up here in sizable roles, as Selfridge's long-suffering wife and long-suffering financial manager, respectively.3 stars out of 5.  Last note: this show has been inaptly compared to ""Downton Abbey"".  BBC's ""The Duchess of Duke Street"" from the 1970s is a liker comparison: both are set in Edwardian West End London.  In this show, Selfridge is the fearless innovator; in ""Duchess"", Gemma Jones was the fearless female hotelier and chef, proprietor of the Cavendish Hotel, the first of her kind.  Both shows are soaps, although ""Duchess"" is far more compelling, if only because BBC was so clearly committed to it.  If you liked ""Mr Selfridge"", I strongly recommend ""Duchess of Duke Street"" -- that one's definitely 5 stars, at least from me.  Fun fact: Selfridges & Co. and the Cavendish Hotel, both still in existence, are 1 kilometer apart.  Within the radius of that 1 kilometer lay the very epicenter of social change in London 100 years ago, or so it would seem.",3,An American werewolf in London,1386633600,"12 10,

I remember my sister taking me shopping at Selfridge while visiting her in England when I was 14. I loved the store and it really was a great experience to go there. One of the things I got there were really cool cargo pants, when not many had them yet. I certainly made a fashion statement when I came back to Iceland in 1978. Thanks to SelfridgeI think Jeremy Piven is perfect for the the portrayal if Mr. Selfridge. A modern man trying to break out of old molds. He is potraying a modern man in an old world. I love the show, seeing the incredible costumes and the fashion during this time. The show touches on the dilemma and moralality, the people face in a changing world just through shopping during this time period.

How England goes from small, privately-owned shops where you have to buy a coat in one shop, soap in another, jewelry in another, tea in another--where you aren't really allowed to touch the merchandise by your lonesome, but are served--to a modern department store such as Selfridges where the goods are on display and you can touch and smell and see them.  What a change!The show starts off with the building of the store and Harry Selfridge getting backing for his enterprize, mainly by working with Lady Mae (a woman who started in the theatre and married into the nobility) who sets the local fashion trends and knows men of money.  Harry Selfridge lives life big, not just in his business but his private life as we meet his long-suffering wife who has to put up with his love of the ladies.  After the store is built, then Selfridge needs to teach Londoners how to enjoy shopping, not just with the beautiful displays but with publicity stunts and getting a fabulous woman to be the face of Selfridges.This is an interwoven plot with many stories going at the same time.  My favorite is that of the poor woman who comes into Selfridges women's fashion and soon finds herself blossoming with ideas, even as she has to continue to help her less than bright brother and deal with an alcoholic father.But the real star of the show remains the store itself.  Vivid colors, beautiful hats and dresses, and lovely displays that I would find hard to resist myself.  I want to shop at this store so badly...which is half the point.  The second star of the show is Selfridge himself...outspoken, bombastic, a little crazy, powerfully dedicated to his business, and who is always talking about how important the employees are to his store.

The costumes are most assuredly the main character and for an introductory outing that seems to set the scene just fine.The interest comes from the apparently true fact that this represents the tale of how London's Selfridge's Department store began.  Harry Gordon Selfridge comes to London to establish a department store that understands what women want ` `to go shopping.' After a brief moment in the standard London store Selfridge is put off by the stringent rules and regulations of just how people can purchase items in a store atmosphere (as opposed to scheduled meetings with personal tailors and dressmakers in private). Jeremy Piven sparkles in the role of the flamboyant optimist who doesn't seem to know the meaning of defeat and manages to pull off the opening of his glorious new store a year after he arrives.  He loses, backing, finds backing form a wealthy Lady Mae and her husband, makes changes in the way employees are hired and treated, and falls in fancy with a chorus girl Miss Love (Zo Tapper), befriends a salesgirl Agnes (Aisling Loftus) who lost her job when Selfridge visited her previous employer, greets his wife (Frances O'Connor) and family when they arrive from America to join him, and is privy to all manner of subplots that are always necessary if a series is going to be successful.The story is a bit less than involving but the plots that are established (the variety of which remind us that the series is written by four writers and directed by four directors) offer suggestion that there will be some interesting derring-do, intrigue, criminal activity, love affairs, family squabbles  - all those things that make continuing watching the series worth while. There are some fine actors involved - Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Ron Cook, Gr&eacute;gory Fitoussi, Lauren Crace, Amanda Abbington, Amy Beth Hayes, Tom Goodman-Hill, Trystan Gravelle, Malcom Rennie, Deborah Cornelius, Kika Markham, Catherine Kelly and many more in this huge cast.

While the show is based on the real store and its founder, much of the show is fiction as are most of the characters. However, the innovations that Harry brings to retail are very true and you will be amazed and amused in the first few episodes by the horror expressed by the store employees at Harry's innovations (put the merchandise out where shoppers can see and touch it? Oh the humanity!). The story follows several of the employees' lives so you get a feel for both the upper and lower classes in early 20th century London.

Casey,"[5, 11]","For those who were expecting another Downton Abbey or House of Eliott series with interesting looks at the details and requirements of running a complex business or operation, this will not impress.  The business itself is presented as no more than a bit of superficial showmanship.  Workers and key managers seem to be appointed on a whim, have affairs and personal melodramas while Selfridge himself seems to be immersed in his own affairs along with occasional headline grabbing stunts designed to create a fascade of public interest and success.  Does anyone really think that a successful department store depended largely on having an airplane in the lobby or depended only upon the window designs?  What about price and product?  In one especially disappointing scene where Selfridge instructs his buyers to purchase the best and buy a lot of it with no parameters on quality, price, variety, standards, etc. that would reflect on what clientele they intend to attract.  One would expect Selfridge to have brought some business acumen with him from his success in Chicago, but there is absolutely no evidence of it so far in this series.  It seems to be more a collection of side dramas with the business itself as an excuse for the whole mess.  ---  The costumes and uniforms of workers in Selfridges also create a misconception about the actual working conditions of the time.  We are made to think that getting a job at the Selfridge mega store meant that you ""had it made"".  You don't get the actual picture of the drudgery and long hours and low salaries brought out by a House of Elliot in its dealing with the pressures and immense amount of detailed work in the fashion/dress design business or the running of a great house in Downton Abbey from the ""downstairs"" perspective. I would like to know what people who actually work in large department stores think about this series. ---  I hope that the series improves, but find the start to be a huge disappoitment and embarkation on the wrong track for anyone with even a modest curiosity about the actual operation of department stores in big cities like London and Chicago.",2,Superficial and Insulting Exhibitionism,1365120000,"04 5, 2013",2013,2139,"['who', 'were', 'expecting', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'House', 'Eliott', 'series', 'interesting', 'looks', 'details', 'requirements', 'running', 'complex', 'business', 'operation', 'will', 'not', 'impress', 'business', 'presented', 'more', 'bit', 'superficial', 'showmanship', 'Workers', 'key', 'managers', 'seem', 'be', 'appointed', 'whim', 'have', 'affairs', 'personal', 'melodramas', 'Selfridge', 'be', 'immersed', 'own', 'affairs', 'occasional', 'headline', 'grabbing', 'stunts', 'designed', 'create', 'fascade', 'public', 'interest', 'success', 'Does', 'anyone', 'really', 'think', 'successful', 'department', 'store', 'depended', 'largely', 'having', 'airplane', 'lobby', 'depended', 'only', 'window', 'designs', 'What', 'price', 'product', 'one', 'especially', 'disappointing', 'scene', 'where', 'Selfridge', 'buyers', 'purchase', 'best', 'buy', 'lot', 'parameters', 'quality', 'price', 'variety', 'standards', 'etc', 'would', 'reflect', 'clientele', 'intend', 'attract', 'One', 'would', 'expect', 'Selfridge', 'have', 'brought', 'business', 'acumen', 'success', 'Chicago', 'absolutely', 'evidence', 'so', 'far', 'series', 'be', 'more', 'collection', 'side', 'dramas', 'business', 'excuse', 'whole', 'mess', 'costumes', 'uniforms', 'workers', 'Selfridges', 'also', 'create', 'misconception', 'actual', 'working', 'conditions', 'time', 'are', 'made', 'think', 'getting', 'job', 'Selfridge', 'mega', 'store', 'meant', 'had', 'made', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'actual', 'picture', 'drudgery', 'long', 'hours', 'low', 'salaries', 'brought', 'out', 'House', 'Elliot', 'dealing', 'pressures', 'immense', 'amount', 'detailed', 'work', 'fashion/dress', 'design', 'business', 'running', 'great', 'house', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'downstairs', 'perspective', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'what', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'work', 'large', 'department', 'stores', 'think', 'series', 'hope', 'series', 'find', 'start', 'be', 'huge', 'disappoitment', 'embarkation', 'wrong', 'track', 'anyone', 'even', 'modest', 'curiosity', 'actual', 'operation', 'department', 'stores', 'big', 'cities', 'London', 'Chicago']",N/A

Then again a lot of the movies he's been in have been somewhat ... ahem ... less than memorable.  Although not due to lack of Piven's acting, which has always managed to shine above even the worst of material.When I heard that two of my favorite things, &#34;Masterpiece Theatre&#34; and &#34;Jeremy Piven&#34; were going to be combined into a wonderful confabulation I was overjoyed.  Magical Masterpiece sets, fully fleshed out parts played by wonderful talented actors, great music, beautiful photography.  I couldn't wait.Mr. Selfridge is a series which pulls out all the stops and wants to work, but never quite pulls it off.  Don't get me wrong, Piven works hard at giving life to the part of  the dynamic Mr Selfridge ... too damned hard ... and that's one of Selfridge's biggest problems.  Piven plays Selfridge way too over the top to feel real.  Considering the period, the fact it's taking place in a VERY conservative Britain, there's no way in hell Selfridge (as payed by Piven) have gotten away with being so off the wall, without offending almost everyone he met.One only has to read the history books to know the show has used a broad brush to paint a caricature-like version of Selfridge.  While many of the events taking place in the show are based on fact, they have stretched the truth a tad, when they didn't have to.  The truth is/was fantastical enough on it's own.While the supporting cast is wonderful, the story lines are weak and thread bear.  While Piven's sincerity and warmth comes across on the screen, his acting is so consistently over the top as to be painful to watch.I hope the show continues, as I have enjoyed watching it.

I don't think the actors playing the Selfridge family are doing a particularly good job of it. I've really liked Jeremy Piven in other things, but in this his character seems more like a caricature. He seems to approach it like Mr. Selfridge is a character in a comedic play. He just seems to over-project. I'm not sure of the name of the actress playing his wife, but she also seems a bit off.

1573766,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008PEHZXI,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[141, 161]","The new British soap opera ""Mr. Selfridge"" has a certain frothy charm that will likely appeal to many viewers looking for something a bit more lighthearted from the Masterpiece Classic mantle.  Ironically (or strangely) enough, ""Mr. Selfridge"" is the second series set in the world of retail to arrive on British airwaves this season following the popular ""The Paradise.""  The show, which runs for 10 episodes (not 8 as are currently listed in the product description), is centered around the formation of Selfridge's Department Store in London after the turn of the century.  Although the idea of the show is based in fact, I'm not entirely sure I would even call this a historical drama.  It adheres more to the lines of a classic soap opera, with an ensemble of characters engaging in the expected romantic subplots and looking resplendent in period finery. The hat budget alone must surely be frightening (as are some of Mrs. Selfridge's hats)!  It never digs particularly deep into complex characterizations, but it breezes along at a nice clip making for a likable enough concoction.  Along the way, we see the birth of retail and a romanticized way of life from an era gone by.Jeremy Piven plays the titular character, a flamboyant American with dreams of retail grandeur.  It's a showy lead and often over-the-top, but it's one that fits comfortably into Piven's wheelhouse.  Piven's most notorious role, of course, is that of unscrupulous Ari Gold on HBO's ""Entourage"" where his over-sized performance was hysterically unrepentant.  As Selfridge, he displays some of this same manic energy if not the profane hilarity.  He isn't a saint, though, as he has an eye for the ladies despite being married.  But I think that the audience is meant to find his antics more humorous than hurtful.  While I thought Piven would be front and center throughout, ""Mr. Selfridge"" is structured to incorporate a much bigger cast.  And so, we get varying viewpoints from the man himself and throughout the staff down to the newest shop girl.  As with any drama, some of the character threads are more inherently interesting than others--but, as I said, this is about amusement more than real depth.In addition to Piven, I must give a shout out to Frances O'Connor as the missus.  Since I made fun of her hat wardrobe, it only seemed fair.  At times, ""Mr. Selfridge"" can seem a bit overcooked and overstated if I'm to be perfectly honest.  Sometimes, the drama is played to the rafters so to speak.  And this slightly inconsistent tone can be a bit alienating.  Is it going for heartfelt drama or something decidedly more wacky?  I don't think the makers are always sure.  From a personal standpoint, though, I've spent my fair share of time in the retail arena so the program's environment was of interest to me.  And as that world continues to crumble to an online marketplace, the notions of customer service and doing a good job as its own reward seem positively alien in this era!  But that's part of the appeal of ""Mr. Selfridge.""  It was a different world.  The show is diverting enough, if relatively lightweight.  It has been greenlit for a second season already, so now is your opportunity to get in on the ground floor of this import.

1573779,AFOHUSVNZZ49W,B008PEHZXI,K. Reynolds,"[2, 3]","IMAGINE A TIME when shopping was a bare bones experience. No display counters or windows; virtually no choice in merchandise; little customer service, no celebrity endorsements and no sale discounts!American entrepreneur Harold Selfridge changed that bleak practice forever when he opened Selfridge's in 1908, a grand scale department store on Oxford Street in London. It is still advertised as ""The Best Department Store in the World.""In the first of 10 episodes, we get a look at the bad old days when Harry visits a London shop. Seeking a pair of ladies gloves, he talks sales girl Agnes Towler (Aisling Loftus) into displaying her stock on the counter. She is fired as soon as Harry leaves the store. The customer, it seems, is not in the right.Things get better for Agnes later as Selfridge's opens and she takes a new position there. Her story is just one among some 30-odd characters in this costumed drama from PBS. As with other Masterpiece Theatre historical dramas such as ""Downton Abbey,"" the characters are captivating, and sets, costumes and locations are divine. Selfridge's was built full-scale in a warehouse, from its palatial first floor and marble staircase, to the wood-paneled offices above. Sets also include artist studios, Downton-like London homes, gambling parlors and theaters.The gentlemen look dashing in early 20th Century style and the women are amazing. Various styles are on display, from the shop workers formal black garb, to the high class ladies obliged to change outfits several times a day.Still, this showcase would be nothing without a jewel to hang it on. That would be Jeremy Piven's outstanding performance as Harry Selfridge. Known for his role as hyper-agent Ari Gold in ""Entourage,"" Piven's Selfridge is also driven - and charismatic, confident, brilliant and heartbreakingly flawed. Nothing worth doing is worth doing without Harry's version of a big brass band. He must be loved by all or it's no good. And when he walks down the grand staircase, with arms raised and sparkling smile, we almost expect those below to burst into a chorus of ""Hello, Dolly!"" ... or ""Hello, Harry!""While it's fascinating to know ""Mr. Selfridge"" is based on a true story, this first season - out of a projected four - seems rather lighthearted. We get to see how Harry builds his store and reputation, always coming up with fresh ideas when needed, like a sale on merchandise. I enjoyed his guest celebrity visits such as famed Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, South Pole explorer Ernest Shackelford, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes, who arrives for a book signing and stays to hold a s&eacute;ance.Sadly, Harry also brings in his mistress, popular showgirl, Ellen Love (Zoe Tapper), whom he designates as The Spirit of Selfridge's. In the short history clips shown after episode broadcasts - missing from the discs, alas - we learn that Ellen is a combination of several of Harry's girlfriends. While Harry is devoted to his wife and five children, he can't resist a pretty face.We learn a bit about how the series was made through the short making-of feature. It's anecdotal, and we get some good stories. Still, I wish those end-episode moments had been gathered and collected here. They fill in more about Selfridge, the people he worked with, and the times they lived in.Regardless - ""Selfridge's"" makes great viewing to while away a humid summer night or cold winter evening.-- Kay Reynolds",4,Enter the dazzling world of 'Mr. Selfridge'!,1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,3447,"['IMAGINE', 'TIME', 'when', 'shopping', 'was', 'bare', 'bones', 'experience', 'display', 'counters', 'windows', 'virtually', 'choice', 'merchandise', 'little', 'customer', 'service', 'celebrity', 'endorsements', 'sale', 'discounts', 'American', 'entrepreneur', 'Harold', 'Selfridge', 'changed', 'bleak', 'practice', 'forever', 'when', 'opened', 'Selfridge', '1908', 'grand', 'scale', 'department', 'store', 'Oxford', 'Street', 'London', 'still', 'advertised', 'Best', 'Department', 'Store', 'World', 'first', '10', 'episodes', 'get', 'look', 'bad', 'old', 'days', 'when', 'Harry', 'London', 'shop', 'Seeking', 'pair', 'ladies', 'gloves', 'sales', 'girl', 'Agnes', 'Towler', 'Aisling', 'Loftus', 'displaying', 'stock', 'counter', 'fired', 'as', 'soon', 'Harry', 'store', 'customer', 'not', 'right.Things', 'get', 'better', 'Agnes', 'later', 'Selfridge', 'opens', 'new', 'position', 'there', 'story', 'just', 'one', '30-odd', 'characters', 'costumed', 'drama', 'PBS', 'other', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'historical', 'dramas', 'such', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'characters', 'are', 'captivating', 'sets', 'costumes', 'locations', 'are', 'divine', 'Selfridge', 'was', 'built', 'full-scale', 'warehouse', 'palatial', 'first', 'floor', 'marble', 'staircase', 'wood-paneled', 'offices', 'Sets', 'also', 'include', 'artist', 'studios', 'Downton-like', 'London', 'homes', 'gambling', 'parlors', 'theaters.The', 'gentlemen', 'look', 'dashing', 'early', '20th', 'Century', 'style', 'women', 'are', 'amazing', 'Various', 'styles', 'are', 'display', 'shop', 'workers', 'formal', 'black', 'garb', 'high', 'class', 'ladies', 'obliged', 'change', 'outfits', 'several', 'times', 'day.Still', 'showcase', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'jewel', 'hang', 'would', 'be', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Harry', 'Selfridge', 'Known', 'role', 'hyper-agent', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'Entourage', 'Piven', 'Selfridge', 'also', 'driven', 'charismatic', 'confident', 'brilliant', 'heartbreakingly', 'flawed', 'Nothing', 'worth', 'doing', 'worth', 'doing', 'Harry', 'version', 'big', 'brass', 'band', 'must', 'be', 'loved', 'good', 'when', 'walks', 'down', 'grand', 'staircase', 'arms', 'raised', 'sparkling', 'smile', 'almost', 'expect', 'burst', 'chorus', 'Hello', 'Dolly', 'Hello', 'Harry', 'fascinating', 'know', 'Mr.', 'Selfridge', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'first', 'season', 'projected', 'four', 'rather', 'lighthearted', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'Harry', 'store', 'reputation', 'always', 'coming', 'up', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'when', 'needed', 'sale', 'merchandise', 'enjoyed', 'guest', 'celebrity', 'visits', 'such', 'famed', 'Russian', 'ballerina', 'Anna', 'Pavlova', 'South', 'Pole', 'explorer', 'Ernest', 'Shackelford', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'creator', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'who', 'book', 'signing', 'stays', 'hold', 's', 'eacute', 'ance.Sadly', 'Harry', 'also', 'mistress', 'popular', 'showgirl', 'Ellen', 'Love', 'Zoe', 'Tapper', 'whom', 'Spirit', 'Selfridge', 'short', 'history', 'clips', 'shown', 'episode', 'broadcasts', 'missing', 'discs', 'alas', 'learn', 'Ellen', 'combination', 'several', 'Harry', 'girlfriends', 'Harry', 'devoted', 'wife', 'five', 'children', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'pretty', 'face.We', 'learn', 'bit', 'how', 'series', 'was', 'made', 'short', 'making-of', 'feature', 'anecdotal', 'get', 'good', 'stories', 'Still', 'wish', 'end-episode', 'moments', 'had', 'been', 'gathered', 'collected', 'here', 'fill', 'more', 'Selfridge', 'people', 'worked', 'times', 'lived', 'in.Regardless', 'Selfridge', 'great', 'viewing', 'while', 'away', 'humid', 'summer', 'night', 'cold', 'winter', 'evening.', 'Kay', 'Reynolds']",N/A

I learnt that many things we consider 'normal' in retail today were introduced by Mr. Selfridge - ""There are only  'x' more shopping Days 'till Christmas""; the customer is always right; special events to get people into a store; getting shoppers into a store without any specific purpose - just to 'window-shop' and keep them in there longer than needed to buy the item they came in for by having a store restaurant (The Palm Room) a reading room, relaxing room etc. - were all innovations put into practice by Mr. Selfridge and are woven into the series. It's a fascinating story and the series does a good job getting this larger than life person and personality onto a tiny screen.

First of all, Jeremy Piven ruins every scene he is in. His performance is flat; as though he is reading each line from a cue card, with the same 'over the top' over-acting voice everytime. I mean, he is relentlessly bad in this series. The other annoying thing and i know this sounds picky, but Mrs Selfridge's hats are so ridiculously big that in every scene she is in wearing a hat...it takes center stage, as though she is wearing a huge waste basket on her head and looks quite comical. None of the other actresses have hats like this, so i wonder what the costume designers must be thinking.

Yes, I know the real Selfridge was bombastic and brash, but I would imagine that in order to be successful, the real Selfridge would have to have a certain amount of charisma as well.  Piven has none.  He seems to be operating on two levels - loud and louder.  And no matter what his volume, his tone is wooden and his performance is cringe-worthy.  If not for a few of the secondary storylines, I wouldn't be watching the series at all.  It's a perfect example of the train-wreck cliche.  It's horrible, yet I cannot look away.  I keep thinking it cannot possibly get worse, but then it DOES!  And to add insult to injury, Frances O'Connor as Rose Selfridge is pretty dreadful as well.  I usually like O'Connor's work well enough, but there is no nuance to her performance here, just a lot of teeth gnashing and hand wringing.  The scenes with Piven and O'Connor together are unbelievable (and not in a good way).  As other reviewers have mentioned, the costumes and the scenery are beautiful, but all the pretty costumes in the world do not make up for a lackluster show.  There's a lot of flash, but not a lot of substance.There is one good thing I can say about this show.

Other than that, the show is interesting with its plot and shenanigans going on in the early 1900's, England.  My wife and I hope they make more seasons.

Gilbert,"[0, 0]","You got to love the brashness of a man who decides he's going to brave a second American Revolution by bringing American merchandising techniques to the British. But that's exactly what Mr. Selfridge does-- brings American can-do to the staid and stuffy British and transforms them.Selfridge is a grand old name in stores in London (think Macy's or Marshall Field's in Chicago) and while this can't be considered a historical documentary, it is pretty true to the spirit of the man behind the store. Selfridge did promote the store in dramatic fashion-- whatever great event occurred or newest piece of technology came about, Selfridge used it to sell merchandise. Great explorers, adventurers, actresses-- he wove that into the fabric of the store, showcasing much of the latest and greatest (and not so great) in his display windows to create a buzz and excitement to attract publicity and shoppers. If he didn't cross paths with the names of the day in reality, he does here to great effect.Selfridge here is enthusiastic and principled in his business even if he is not in his home life. And the characters around him are part of the fabric of the times, clerks and managers who couldn't possibly buy anything at the store they work at because they don't make enough money until Selfridge offers sales and promotions designed to bring in all walks of life to his store.What makes this so watchable is to see the self-promoting Selfridge, played so well by Jeremy Pivens, pull everyone into his vortex. He's charming and boy-like in his appreciation of the latest gadgets or the news-makers of the day that it's hard not to enjoy what he enjoys. His employees are also caught up in his wake as well as in their own little worlds of self-promotion or self-survival in a time when there is a still a kind of class prejudice. It's a fascinating world that is made even more fabulous by the solid acting and keen attention to detail.

1573945,A1EUI8FA4KNV95,B008PEHZXI,Rissi,"[2, 2]","Following in the footsteps of BBC's 'The Paradise,' ITV introduced its own take on the real-life American entrepreneur and the fawning fascination over England's first department store. Where one is charming and takes some fascinating twists, the other is riddled with clich&eacute;s and immoralities. Nonetheless, surprisingly both are entertaining. Read on to find out which category this falls into.Causing a flutter of gossip and excitement in London is the arrival of Harry Selfridge (Jeremy Piven). An American businessman looking for investors, Harry has grand plans for an equally grand and lavish department store. For all his optimism, nothing pans out as he planned. Shortly after arrival in England, before even the building has begun, Harry's investor backs out, thinking the amount of monies his partner is willing to spend on one place. This leaves Harry in a predicament but not enough to stop the internal optimist to give up his dream. This leads him into the acquaintance of Lady Mae Loxsley (Katherine Kelly), a woman with considerable social influence - she knows all the right people but will expect occasional favors from Mr. Selfridge. Among the social introductions is Ellen Love (Zo Tapper), a wildly popular chorus girl who sets her sights on rising above that of a mere dancer... and Harry plays perfectly into her schemes.Arriving in London shortly before the grand opening of the store is the Selfridge family. Harry's wife Rose (Frances O'Conner) is an American beauty who gave up her artistic dreams to raise her family - including her eldest daughter Rosalie (Poppy Lee Friar) who soon becomes swept up in the aristocratic world her father is becoming a part of.It's been a long while since the brilliant Andrew Davies ('Pride & Prejudice,' ITV's 'Sense & Sensibility') brought anything to our screen. Fortunately, his latest put forth more than a mere 10 hours of opulence and gives us dozens of character's to puzzle over. In ten episodes, many things happen. We come to know the characters which the camera focuses on - everyone from an eager shop girl named Agnes (Aisling Loftus) to an opportunist painter who's as devious as Harry is - and despite our best attempts to remain impartial or become attached to many of them, we inevitably do, picking champions and villains along the way. Like the ABC show, Revenge, there aren't many characters easy to like in this soapy drama. If we are being honest, this has to be said. Each of them has their soapbox moments and each have their redeeming qualities but as each rotating theme falls into the same patterns and follows on the same path of destruction and immoral behavior, it becomes a revolving door none of them are successful at sidestepping.Early on, Davies introduces us to some lovely characters. Not the least of which is Agnes Towler and her brother George. Both are cute. Unfortunately, Davies ruins Agnes by freefalling her into an unhealthy dalliance and the possibility of a second one. To her credit, so far I am proud she is still a ""nice"" person and George does get a cute minor thread in the final three installments. In a story full of scoundrels and people just teetering on the edge of becoming one, anyone with a moral compass desperately needs someone or one couple to root for. As the screen blacks out the first series of angst, there is a tumble of thoughts to think through - this isn't a show in which the good outweighs the bad and yet, I liked it. As my mother and I watched through it, both of us agreed it was good although not the best of its kind. I was disgusted further by Selfridge's affairs for two reasons, first his indiscretions are subtly suggested to be a ""disease"" and then, one has to consider what a ""good"" guy he is otherwise - he's a cheerful person hard not to like in one life, in another he hurts his lovely wife. At work, a viewer cannot help admire his loyalty at the workplace, to his employees; at home the reaction is just the opposite. If there is one thing to be grateful for, nothing is glorified; the consequences of wrong behavior are glaringly evident - maybe not materialistically, but emotionally and personally the costs are astronomical!Wrapping up in the fashion it should - in uncertainty and character's reaping the consequences of their own making, I'll be sticking by the show. It has potential and is gorgeous to look at. Inside the walls are particularly opulent and brimming with pretty things, the evening gowns are exquisite as are the surroundings in which tuxedo clad gentleman and the ladies are inserted into. There are a few nice scenes between Harry and his children and his eldest daughter gets a few precious moments plus moments of fun when we see famed historical names paying visits to Selfridge's (Sir. Arthur Conan Doyle!) and I was abnormally proud of someone for not falling into the arms of another just because she'd been hurt, but the trappings aren't always worth the risk. If you are looking for something that is nearly verbatim to this albeit on a much smaller scale, 'The Paradise' is the better place to enjoy some window shopping.

1573947,A2L6TI9AA2U4LK,B008PEHZXI,RMWARZ,"[0, 0]","As with most multi-part series, Mr. Selfridge--a chronicle of high-end retailing in early 20th century London--gets off to a slow start in Episode 1 as characters and situations are introduced.  Things pick up in subsequent episodes, but the series never seems to hit a steady stride as gripping episodes frequently alternate with ones that are just average.  Typical of UK-produced period pieces, the production values are outstanding and the acting is first rate with one glaring exception.  Jeremy Piven's performance as Selfridge is rather uneven.  Too often he seems to be declaiming his lines rather than naturally acting the part, yet in other scenes he successfully conveys the humanity of a very complex character.  The chief turn-off for me with this series is that very few of the significant characters are thoroughly likeable.  The vast majority of the principles, from Selfridge on down to the lowliest shop girl, are on the make, always with an eye to the main chance and many of them quite willing to engage in morally or ethically questionable behavior as long as there is a quid pro quo involved that will advance their personal agenda.  What's worse, the characters who don't fit this mold all seem to be set up to be losers in the long run.

I don't like Jeremy Piven and, despite the fact that I live in San Francisco, I don't like the Victorian era. I'm probably the only person in this town who loathes Victorian houses. That being said, PBS had a rerun of episode two on the other night and I watched it. Like nearly all BBC Productions, this one has attention to detail down to the nth degree. The costumes, sets and other &#34;physical&#34; aspects are outstanding. The story is pure fluff and the performances vary. The ladies are the strongest here. A number of their characters are interesting, if not particularly moving. I am reserving my judgement for Mr. Piven for season two. In the initial episodes, he is both over over the top and wooden, a disconcerting combination. He gets better, or at least his character does, after episode 4, when the plot lines are ramped up a bit. I've seen a lot of complaining on Amazon about the &#34;nothing happens here&#34;. Well, it does. The plot lines revolve around human behavior and not car crashes, etc., though there is one. Many of things that I thought may be out of context, like automatic fire extinguishers, and cars able to go 50 mph, at this point in time, are actually accurate. As usual, BBC has done their research. This isn't Fox, after all. People also want to compare this to Downton Abbey, another series I was avoiding, but, this isn't the same. Downton is far more complicated with a lot more characters and better acting. Mr. Selfridge is mindless and pretty entertainment. Not great but, not bad. Season Two will tell if this series has gotten past it's growing pains and if Mr. Selfridge himself is not so odious. Love those one-star reviews who claim the series to be solely about adultery and sex. It is not and this series is no more trashy than any other currently on American television. In fact, it's much less trashy than any &#34;reality&#34; television that shows what &#34;real&#34; Americans are about. Grow up. Just because something advertises that it is &#34;Victorian&#34; does not mean that people didn't behave in this manner at the time. They just didn't flaunt it!

1574005,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B008PEHZXI,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[3, 4]","There are lots of reviews (40+) of the series ""Mr. Selfridge"" on Amazon already but it appears that most are of the series that is airing on PBS on Masterpiece Theater. The series started March 31st with a ""two hour"" episode and continues weekly with nine more ""hour-long"" episodes. But PBS Home video is releasing the full series on April 23rd and - for various reasons, which I'll explain below - I recommend the DVD over setting your timer to watch it.I'll say up front I love this series and that I never could get involved in the ""Downton Abbey "" series - even though ""Selfridge"" takes place about 10 years earlier than DA. Maybe it's because most of the characters in Selfridge are ""commoners"" and the central character and his family are American (though all except for Jeremey Piven (as the title character, Harry Selfridge) are British actors playing Americans. And it may be because I'm interested in the history of commerce. This is - of course - based on the real life of the Chicago-born Selfridge coming to London and starting the first major department store where ""everyone was welcome"" and customers could actually ""handle the goods"". He was the PT Barnum of merchandising having Arthur Conan Doyle and Sir Ernest Shackelton make public appearances.Yes, I'll agree that Piven was probably not the best choice for the lead but that's no reason to avoid the series. The rest of the cast is superb and the production style is marvelous. They actually recreated the huge first and second floors of the London store in a warehouse. The plot will keep you guessing who is having affairs with who and here is another reason for the DVD version. While no full nudity is shown the DVD is the original UK version and, while I haven't seen any of the PBS episodes, I'm assuming that there were some edits.  In the earlier episodes there are some nice Music Hall numbers (similar to those in HBO's ""Boardwalk Empire""). The series is based on the novel ""Shopping, Seduction & Mr. Selfridge"" by Lindy Woodhead.I'll also point out here that - unlike many Masterpiece Theater programs, Selfridge is not a BBC creation. It was produced by the British commercial network, ITV. And since it had commercials in Britain, each ""hour long"" episode is only about 47 minutes in length.With the DVD you won't have to wait till the summer to find out how the story ends (well, it doesn't really ""end"", since this is planned as a continuing series for at least four seasons!), but you can watch one or two episodes at a time.  And, don't worry, the 10 episodes do tell a full story, even if there wasn't a second season.The DVD comes with a bonus ""featurette"" ""Behind The Scenes at Selfridges"" - which runs 26 minutes and features interviews with many of the crew and large cast (there are roughly 30 significant characters in this first season.). Unlike many of the ""making of"" bonuses this one is not loaded with scenes from the series as ""filler"".I've enjoyed watching this DVD over a week and so highly recommend it.I hope this review was both informative and Helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,Review of the NTSC DVD - Original BBC Series -unedited - with bonus featurette,1366243200,"04 18, 2013",2013,3094,"['are', 'lots', 'reviews', '40+', 'series', 'Mr.', 'Selfridge', 'Amazon', 'already', 'most', 'are', 'series', 'airing', 'PBS', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'series', 'started', 'March', '31st', 'two', 'hour', 'episode', 'weekly', 'nine', 'more', 'hour-long', 'episodes', 'PBS', 'Home', 'video', 'releasing', 'full', 'series', 'April', '23rd', 'various', 'reasons', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'setting', 'timer', 'watch', 'it.I', ""'ll"", 'say', 'up', 'front', 'love', 'series', 'never', 'could', 'get', 'involved', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'series', 'even', 'Selfridge', 'place', '10', 'years', 'earlier', 'DA', 'Maybe', 'most', 'characters', 'Selfridge', 'are', 'commoners', 'central', 'character', 'family', 'are', 'American', 'Jeremey', 'Piven', 'title', 'character', 'Harry', 'Selfridge', 'are', 'British', 'actors', 'playing', 'Americans', 'may', 'be', ""'m"", 'interested', 'history', 'commerce', 'course', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'Chicago-born', 'Selfridge', 'coming', 'London', 'starting', 'first', 'major', 'department', 'store', 'where', 'everyone', 'was', 'welcome', 'customers', 'could', 'actually', 'handle', 'goods', 'was', 'PT', 'Barnum', 'merchandising', 'having', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'Sir', 'Ernest', 'Shackelton', 'make', 'public', 'appearances.Yes', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'Piven', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'best', 'choice', 'lead', 'reason', 'avoid', 'series', 'rest', 'cast', 'superb', 'production', 'style', 'marvelous', 'actually', 'recreated', 'huge', 'first', 'second', 'floors', 'London', 'store', 'warehouse', 'plot', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'who', 'having', 'affairs', 'who', 'here', 'reason', 'DVD', 'version', 'full', 'nudity', 'shown', 'DVD', 'original', 'UK', 'version', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'PBS', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'were', 'edits', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'are', 'nice', 'Music', 'Hall', 'numbers', 'similar', 'HBO', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'series', 'based', 'novel', 'Shopping', 'Seduction', 'Mr.', 'Selfridge', 'Lindy', 'Woodhead.I', ""'ll"", 'also', 'point', 'out', 'here', 'many', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'programs', 'Selfridge', 'not', 'BBC', 'creation', 'was', 'produced', 'British', 'commercial', 'network', 'ITV', 'had', 'commercials', 'Britain', 'hour', 'long', 'episode', 'only', 'about', '47', 'minutes', 'length.With', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'till', 'summer', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'story', 'well', ""n't"", 'really', 'end', 'planned', 'continuing', 'series', 'least', 'four', 'seasons', 'can', 'watch', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', '10', 'episodes', 'do', 'tell', 'full', 'story', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'second', 'season.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'featurette', 'Scenes', 'Selfridges', '26', 'minutes', 'features', 'interviews', 'many', 'crew', 'large', 'cast', 'are', 'roughly', '30', 'significant', 'characters', 'first', 'season.', 'many', 'making', 'bonuses', 'one', 'not', 'loaded', 'scenes', 'series', 'filler', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'DVD', 'week', 'so', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.I', 'hope', 'review', 'was', 'informative', 'Helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A

1574055,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B008PEHZXI,Z Hayes,"[15, 18]","I admit I was not really keen when I saw the previews for Mr. Selfridge. A story about a self-made American millionaire who opens the first department store in London did not really appeal to me, and when I saw that Jeremy Piven was to play the pivotal role of Mr. Selfridge, I actually winced thinking it might be a casting disaster.The first episode was OK. I felt that Piven played the role of Mr. Selfridge in an exaggerated, bombastic manner which seemed awkward and not very credible. This was my opinion until I did some research online about the real-life Selfridge. It seems he was an over-the-top, larger than life character so Piven's portrayal was not far off the mark, no matter how awkward it appears at first. Also, as the series progresses (there are 10 episodes in all), Piven tones down his theatrics a little, especially as the plot calls for more somber moments and Selfridge's character gets enmeshed in one turmoil after another.The casting is actually quite good as are the various story arcs running through season one. There's Piven of course and Frances O'Connor who plays Rose Selfridge, the long-suffering wife. As the story moves along, viewers get to see the domestic drama of Mr. and Mrs. Selfridge. Rose is tired of her husband's philandering, especially when Harry Selfridge becomes involved with a chorus girl named Ellen Love (Zoe Tapper), and Rose in turn becomes involved with a younger man, a handsome painter named Roddy (Oliver Jackson-Cohen)who is besotted with her. But the high drama is not merely in Selfridge's household. There's plenty to keep viewers interested in the tension and drama within the lives of Selfridge's employees.Aisling Loftus plays the young, innocent, yet capable Agnes Towler who is trying desperately to keep her younger brother and herself above water and away from an abusive father. As Season One progresses, Agnes finds herself coming into her own, discovering the strength to stand up for herself, and also finds romance. There's aspiring restaurateur Victor (Trystan Gravelle) who is willing to do just about anything to realize his dreams, the Machiavellian chorus girl turned society woman, Lady Mae Locksley (Katherine Kelly), dashing window dresser Henri Leclair (Gregory Fitoussi), and many more.Part of what got me into this series was the excellent storytelling. The focus is not merely on human relationships but also on societal issues of the time such as the suffragette movement, the dilemma of the independent woman, the evils of capitalism, the double standards as seen in what men could do and women could not, and more. Each episode weaves the various intricate story arcs into a cohesive whole. It may not always be tightly-woven, but the story lines are engaging and kept my interest. I felt that over the ten episodes, the stories got better and the ensemble cast matured into their respective roles, making this a promising period drama. I am sorry to see the end of Season One and can't wait for Season Two.",5,Entertaining and engaging period drama,1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,3001,"['admit', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'keen', 'when', 'saw', 'previews', 'Mr.', 'Selfridge', 'A', 'story', 'self-made', 'American', 'millionaire', 'who', 'first', 'department', 'store', 'London', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'appeal', 'when', 'saw', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'was', 'play', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Mr.', 'Selfridge', 'actually', 'winced', 'thinking', 'might', 'be', 'casting', 'disaster.The', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'OK', 'felt', 'Piven', 'played', 'role', 'Mr.', 'Selfridge', 'exaggerated', 'bombastic', 'manner', 'seemed', 'awkward', 'not', 'very', 'credible', 'was', 'opinion', 'did', 'research', 'online', 'real-life', 'Selfridge', 'was', 'over-the-top', 'larger', 'life', 'character', 'so', 'Piven', 'portrayal', 'was', 'not', 'far', 'mark', 'matter', 'how', 'first', 'Also', 'series', 'are', '10', 'episodes', 'Piven', 'down', 'theatrics', 'little', 'especially', 'plot', 'more', 'somber', 'moments', 'Selfridge', 'character', 'enmeshed', 'one', 'turmoil', 'another.The', 'casting', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'are', 'various', 'story', 'arcs', 'running', 'season', 'one', 'Piven', 'course', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'who', 'plays', 'Rose', 'Selfridge', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'story', 'moves', 'along', 'viewers', 'get', 'see', 'domestic', 'drama', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Selfridge', 'Rose', 'tired', 'husband', 'philandering', 'especially', 'when', 'Harry', 'Selfridge', 'involved', 'chorus', 'girl', 'named', 'Ellen', 'Love', 'Zoe', 'Tapper', 'Rose', 'turn', 'becomes', 'involved', 'younger', 'man', 'handsome', 'painter', 'named', 'Roddy', 'Oliver', 'Jackson-Cohen', 'who', 'besotted', 'high', 'drama', 'not', 'merely', 'Selfridge', 'household', 'plenty', 'keep', 'viewers', 'interested', 'tension', 'drama', 'lives', 'Selfridge', 'employees.Aisling', 'Loftus', 'young', 'innocent', 'yet', 'capable', 'Agnes', 'Towler', 'who', 'trying', 'desperately', 'keep', 'younger', 'brother', 'water', 'away', 'abusive', 'father', 'Season', 'One', 'Agnes', 'coming', 'own', 'discovering', 'strength', 'stand', 'up', 'herself', 'also', 'romance', 'aspiring', 'restaurateur', 'Victor', 'Trystan', 'Gravelle', 'who', 'willing', 'do', 'just', 'anything', 'realize', 'dreams', 'Machiavellian', 'chorus', 'girl', 'turned', 'society', 'woman', 'Lady', 'Mae', 'Locksley', 'Katherine', 'Kelly', 'dashing', 'window', 'dresser', 'Henri', 'Leclair', 'Gregory', 'Fitoussi', 'many', 'more.Part', 'what', 'got', 'series', 'was', 'excellent', 'storytelling', 'focus', 'not', 'merely', 'human', 'relationships', 'also', 'societal', 'issues', 'time', 'such', 'suffragette', 'movement', 'dilemma', 'independent', 'woman', 'evils', 'capitalism', 'double', 'standards', 'seen', 'what', 'men', 'could', 'do', 'women', 'could', 'not', 'more', 'episode', 'various', 'intricate', 'story', 'arcs', 'cohesive', 'whole', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'be', 'tightly-woven', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'engaging', 'kept', 'interest', 'felt', 'ten', 'episodes', 'stories', 'got', 'better', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'matured', 'respective', 'roles', 'making', 'promising', 'period', 'drama', 'am', 'sorry', 'see', 'end', 'Season', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Season', 'Two']",N/A
