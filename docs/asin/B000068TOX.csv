Zakk Wylde just explodes all over this DVD...the guitar solo after ""Suicide Solution"" is great.  It's pretty cool to hear him play the star spangled banner in his solo(In front of a non-american audience no less) as well as a very brief snippet of Van Halen's ""Eruption""... I would have prefered seeing an American audience on this dvd (no disrespect intended).  The behind the scenes footage is basically an episode of The Osbournes only it's them walking the streets of Japan.  Ozzy still mumbles on this one too and his daughter still dresses weird(listen to Jack's short tirade about that while they are outside waiting for a ride. ha ha).

I have been an Ozzy fan since No More Tears mainly because I thought Zak Wyldes  sound was innovative and fresh, given at the time, pop metal and floyd rose tremelos were being done to death. Not sure what all the spitting is about though. Wouldnt want to be a roadie and pick up some foldback speaker Zak had laid one on. Maybe that mass of facial and head heir just keeps getting on and in his mouth. I guess there arent too many guitar heroes with a hair lip.Ozzy is just a legend. If you like his music, you cant deny you've watched some of the Osbournes reality TV show out of interest. So, to his credit, Im amazed this middle aged pom who generally wouldnt know if his pants were on backwards, can still sing in tune and jump around the stage for an hour. (although some of his jumping/clapping antics etc was a little out of time)The footage was really good, the sound wasnt compromised at all by it being live and it was good to see a concert without the hype of stage effects. Just good old music selling itself.There were some extras on the DVD which was OK. A bit too much time spent on Ozzy's bratty kids who I couldnt care less about. If I wanted to watch the antics of a couple of spoilt teenagers I'd hire a Dawsons Creek DVD. Couldve devoted a lot more time instead to the other band members or road/tech crew who work with Ozzy, not just have their credit card bills paid by him.Only real criticism about the concert is the set list. Whilst all the songs were good, would've liked a few off no Rest for the Wicked, but thats just a personal preference.Anyway, just a good value DVD.

Franzman,"[0, 0]","This dvd rocks.I admit, I hestitated to buy it at first because I was afraid it might be just another case of a classic older rocker filming a sub-par show that looks and sounds great technically, but has a tired performance.  Too many bands like Yes and Deep Purple are still touring but just don't hit it anymore in concert.  I could only hope that Ozzy still rocked, and live up to the legend he built, and still pack a quality punch live, the way that The Who or Roger Waters or Fleetwood Mac still do on their newer dvd's.  So I bought the ""Ozzy Live At Budokan"" disc, and popped it in, and...  and...  and...OZZY ROCKS HARD!From the opening seconds, with the crowd going wild and Ozzy shouting ""Let's Go ... CRAZY!!"" there is not a weak moment to be seen.  Ozzy's band is spot-on, and they launch into great versions of ""I Don't Know"" and ""Mr. Crowley"" and ""Crazy Train"" respectfully keeping Randy Rhoads' guitar leads in tact.  The new hit, ""Gets Me Through"" is there, along with an encore of ""Paranoid"" from Ozzy's Black Sabbath Days.Having watched all of MTV's ""The Osbornes"" and seeing how confused and lumbering the Ozz-man could be at times, I was totally impressed by his live energy, his vocal range, and his timing.  He sounds just like he did in younger days, and belts it out like a pro, never missing a beat.  Interestingly enough, Ozzy is NEVER out of breath while running around and singing (unlike young pop-stars Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera who sound far more winded when they try to move and sing at the same time!) and just as importantly, Ozzy RULES the crowd at this show.  I love watching him dump water on the front row or the camera-man, or yelling that the Budokan crowd is not going crazy enough.  He is obviously having a blast, and his band is too, and it is great to finally SEE what the Budokan auditorium looks like at last.

Dunno if it was all that drug use in his day, or what, but he shakes, and does have trouble with some of the songs. He has the physical characteristics of someone who has Parkinson&#65533;s disease. He also has to fixate on a teleprompter for lyrics (not that that&#65533;s a bad thing, because after that many albums it is hard to remember all those lyrics) but everything overall is showing a slower, weaker Ozzy (just watch the Osbounes and how he holds his arm up when he walks, and has a scuffled walk). He is definitely not as intimidating as he once was. I still love Ozzy, and there is still very few performers that can match this man. He has one of the best voices in music, and this is probably the best live show your going to see from him on DVD. My only other complaints (reason for the 3 stars) is there is not a lot of energy in this show, I don&#65533;t mean with just ozzy, zakk also! The audience is the worst ever, maybe there is a cultural difference, who knows, but this isn&#65533;t the most lively crowd in the world. No stage props, no pyrotechnics, only really fancy thing is zakks solo, no fancy lighting.

705316,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B000068TOX,Sky,"[13, 13]","Closing in on 60, Ozzy was in his mid-50s during the 2002 recording of Live at Budokan. You'd never know it by watching his performance on this DVD.It's absolutely amazing that these days when you hear Ozzy speak he sounds as if he just smoked a dooby after 13 Cuervo shots (but supposedly he's been clean for years). Although when he sings he still sounds as good today as he did 30 years ago.The line-up of the band for the show on Live at Budokan is: Ozzy Osbourne, Zakk Wylde (Guitar), Robert Trujillo (Bass), Mike Bordin (Drums) and--hidden off stage the entire show--John Sinclair (Keyboard). All of the guys in the band prior to hitting the stage must have huddled and committed to each other to go out and play the music true to the studio versions of the songs. All of the tracks on Live at Budokan are performed with careful detail and a lot of energy.Throughout the show, Ozzy acts just like you'd think he would (if you're familiar with his other DVDs or have ever been to one of his shows): summing it up...he's one of the iconic rock performers of our time. He acts like he's nuts. He rocks out. He runs (saunters) all over the stage....But the whole time he never skips a beat.And Zakk Wylde? Man...this guy is nothing short of phenomenal. To most of the general public if you say, ""Eddie Van Halen,"" everyone knows who you're talking about. If you say, ""Zakk Wylde,"" everyone usually goes, ""Who?"" Zakk Wylde is one of the best...no wait...is THE best hard rock guitarist on the circuit today. His riffs are heavy and melodic and his solos are complex and precise. He definitely brings his guitar playing talent to his live shows.Trujillo and Bordin back Ozzy and Zakk with talent and classic hard rock showmanship.The picture is full frame on Live at Budokan which kinda stinks, but the audio gives you the choice of stereo or Dolby 5.1; the 5.1 mode is clear and crisp.To me, the biggest negative in almost every Ozzy show that I've seen (and I've seen a lot) is his setlist choices. It seems that he always throws in those songs that were either deep on a release or simply just not the best choices. Here's the setlist for Live at Budokan with my suggestion for replacement (of seven songs) in parenthesis for their next DVD:- I Don't Know- That I Never had (I'd replace with Perry Mason)- Believer (I'd replace with Sabbath Bloody Sabbath)- Junkie (I'd replace with Miracle Man)- Mr. Crowley- Gets Me Through (I'd replace with I Just Want You)- Suicide Solution- No More Tears- I Don't Want to Change the World (I'd replace with Shot in the Dark)- Road to Nowhere (I'd replace with Over the Mountain)- Crazy Train- Mama, I'm Coming Home- Bark at the Moon- Paranoid (I'd replace with Sweet Leaf)I know...a true fan wants the deep cuts; a true fan wouldn't tell Ozzy what to do; etc, etc, etc....Crazy...but that's how it goes.While Live at Budokan is Ozzy's best DVD in terms of quality to date, I'm hoping that with the 2007 release of a new CD called Black Rain, perhaps Ozzy will give us a 2007 or 2008 hi-def, widescreen picture DVD upgrade (with, of course, Dolby and/or DTS sound).",4,Never Too Old To Rock & Roll,1178582400,"05 8, 2007",2007,3106,"['Closing', '60', 'Ozzy', 'was', 'mid-50s', '2002', 'recording', 'Live', 'Budokan', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', 'watching', 'performance', 'DVD.It', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'days', 'when', 'hear', 'Ozzy', 'speak', 'just', 'smoked', 'dooby', '13', 'Cuervo', 'shots', 'supposedly', 'been', 'clean', 'years', 'when', 'still', 'good', 'today', 'did', '30', 'years', 'ago.The', 'line-up', 'band', 'show', 'Live', 'Budokan', 'Ozzy', 'Osbourne', 'Zakk', 'Wylde', 'Guitar', 'Robert', 'Trujillo', 'Bass', 'Mike', 'Bordin', 'Drums', 'hidden', 'off', 'stage', 'entire', 'show', 'John', 'Sinclair', 'Keyboard', 'guys', 'band', 'prior', 'hitting', 'stage', 'must', 'have', 'huddled', 'committed', 'other', 'go', 'out', 'play', 'music', 'true', 'studio', 'versions', 'songs', 'tracks', 'Live', 'Budokan', 'are', 'performed', 'careful', 'detail', 'lot', 'show', 'Ozzy', 'just', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'other', 'DVDs', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'one', 'shows', 'summing', 'up', 'one', 'iconic', 'rock', 'performers', 'time', 'nuts', 'out', 'saunters', 'stage', 'whole', 'time', 'never', 'beat.And', 'Zakk', 'Wylde', 'Man', 'guy', 'nothing', 'short', 'phenomenal', 'most', 'general', 'public', 'say', 'Eddie', 'Van', 'Halen', 'everyone', 'who', ""'re"", 'talking', 'say', 'Zakk', 'Wylde', 'everyone', 'usually', 'Who', 'Zakk', 'Wylde', 'one', 'best', 'wait', 'best', 'hard', 'rock', 'guitarist', 'circuit', 'today', 'riffs', 'are', 'heavy', 'melodic', 'solos', 'are', 'complex', 'precise', 'definitely', 'guitar', 'playing', 'talent', 'live', 'shows.Trujillo', 'Bordin', 'back', 'Ozzy', 'Zakk', 'talent', 'classic', 'hard', 'rock', 'showmanship.The', 'picture', 'full', 'frame', 'Live', 'Budokan', 'stinks', 'audio', 'choice', 'stereo', 'Dolby', '5.1', '5.1', 'mode', 'clear', 'crisp.To', 'biggest', 'negative', 'almost', 'Ozzy', 'show', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'setlist', 'choices', 'always', 'songs', 'were', 'either', 'deep', 'release', 'simply', 'just', 'not', 'best', 'choices', 'Here', 'setlist', 'Live', 'Budokan', 'suggestion', 'replacement', 'seven', 'songs', 'parenthesis', 'next', 'DVD', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Know-', 'Never', 'had', ""'d"", 'replace', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'Believer', ""'d"", 'replace', 'Sabbath', 'Bloody', 'Sabbath', 'Junkie', ""'d"", 'replace', 'Miracle', 'Man', 'Mr.', 'Crowley-', 'Me', ""'d"", 'replace', 'Just', 'Want', 'Suicide', 'Solution-', 'More', 'Tears-', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Want', 'Change', 'World', ""'d"", 'replace', 'Shot', 'Dark', 'Road', 'Nowhere', ""'d"", 'replace', 'Mountain', 'Crazy', 'Train-', 'Mama', ""'m"", 'Coming', 'Home-', 'Bark', 'Moon-', 'Paranoid', ""'d"", 'replace', 'Sweet', 'Leaf', 'know', 'true', 'fan', 'deep', 'cuts', 'true', 'fan', 'would', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Ozzy', 'what', 'do', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', '.Crazy', 'how', 'goes.While', 'Live', 'Budokan', 'Ozzy', 'best', 'DVD', 'terms', 'quality', 'date', ""'m"", 'hoping', '2007', 'release', 'new', 'CD', 'called', 'Black', 'Rain', 'perhaps', 'Ozzy', 'will', 'give', '2007', '2008', 'hi-def', 'widescreen', 'picture', 'DVD', 'upgrade', 'course', 'Dolby', 'DTS', 'sound']",N/A

I have literally every CD of his till date. The concert content is great, however the extras was nothing more than the Osbournes. I dont know why on earth would a great music concert like this be supplemented with dumb footage from the life of the osbournes. I guess becasue Sharon Osbourne is the producer. The DVD has no loop back to main menu after the sections end, it goes right to the Federal warning (some noob created this DVD). The closing credits scroll within 2 seconds of the last song Paranoid -- I would have guessed that as a mark of respect, you will allow the musicians to take a bow, blow kisses to the crowd, see some stage comaradere and then walk off into the darkness backstage before you start scrolling the credits -- but this really disappointed me, its as if they were running out of disc space. The only thing I felt really pissed about the concert is OZZY's repeated profanity on stage after every song and Zakk's constant volcanic spitting - Agreed that he is what he is, but if they could have just bleeped it, I would let my 10 year old nephew watch it.

Let me say this, Ozzy and his band is so sweet, kind, and patient with Japanese audience. Japanese audience are just being Japanese. To behave well in public, and not to make fool out of your self. You can see how much of a difference in culture between the East (intellectual) and the West (emotional). To Japanese people Rock concert is a place to go ""see"",  and to 'listen"". To Western people Rock concert is a place to join with the band, and express themselves without feeing embarrassed, or be self conscious. Also, it would have really helped if Japanese people understood ENGLISH! They had no idea What Ozzy was saying! Almost as if Ozzy was too overwhelming for Oriental/Japanese culture, I know people over there love Ozzy, and admire his music, talent and performance in every way.Budokkan (Martial Arts Hall) was never meant for rock concert exhibition until The Beatles broke that rule!, and it has became ""Rock 'n Roll Hall"" ever since then. and the name of the Hall has became quite well known place. We have quite few good Western Ozzy concert films. So, it was nice to see him ""visit"" this Rock 'n Roll Hall of East anyways. The quality of this film is very good. The sound is superior, and view is fantastic. Only I wish Zakk would quit spitting on the stage so much! I feel sorry for whoever had to clean it up after!  (being very Japanese here).
