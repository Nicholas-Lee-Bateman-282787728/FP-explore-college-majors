797851,A2BK3WYP54ECLD,B0001AOYGK,"L. Hunt ""'Piano Man'  Larry Hunt""","[0, 0]","To my knowledge this is the only film documentary of Spike ever produced. Spike was hugely popular with the World War II generation in the USA. Interestingly, the executive producers of this production are Danish. To me, Spike Jones was the Frank Zappa AND the Weird Al Yankovich of the 40's and 50's. He was an absolutely brilliant musical satirist/comedian, band leader, and percussionist.  This is a great documentary film. All of the folks interviewed seemed to love Spike, despite his reputation as being a sometimes overly strict band leader. Spike's show, which  consisted of his orchestra of musician/comedians, singers, other wild personalities and circus-type performers toured relentlessly in the 1940's. Spike had his own weekly TV show in the early 1950's. I especially love his record albums ""Spike Jones in Stereo: A Spooktacular in Screaming Sound"" (1959), and, the brilliant ""Spike Jones Plays The Charleston"" (Still only available on vinyl).  Spike was truly an American one-of-a-kind artist.  This documentary was originally released on VHS in 1988. It's nice to see it available on DVD now also.",5,The Genius of Spike Jones,1271203200,"04 14, 2010",2010,1115,"['knowledge', 'only', 'film', 'documentary', 'Spike', 'ever', 'produced', 'Spike', 'was', 'hugely', 'popular', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'generation', 'USA', 'Interestingly', 'executive', 'producers', 'production', 'are', 'Danish', 'Spike', 'Jones', 'was', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'Weird', 'Al', 'Yankovich', '40', '50', 'was', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'musical', 'satirist/comedian', 'band', 'leader', 'percussionist', 'great', 'documentary', 'film', 'folks', 'interviewed', 'seemed', 'love', 'Spike', 'reputation', 'being', 'sometimes', 'overly', 'strict', 'band', 'leader', 'Spike', 'show', 'consisted', 'orchestra', 'musician/comedians', 'singers', 'other', 'wild', 'personalities', 'circus-type', 'performers', 'toured', 'relentlessly', '1940', 'Spike', 'had', 'own', 'weekly', 'TV', 'show', 'early', '1950', 'especially', 'love', 'record', 'Spike', 'Jones', 'Stereo', 'Spooktacular', 'Screaming', 'Sound', '1959', 'brilliant', 'Spike', 'Jones', 'Charleston', 'Still', 'only', 'available', 'vinyl', 'Spike', 'was', 'truly', 'American', 'one-of-a-kind', 'artist', 'documentary', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'VHS', '1988', 'nice', 'see', 'available', 'DVD', 'now', 'also']",N/A
797852,A1GAKDKYJ31A4B,B0001AOYGK,P. LINDUP,"[6, 6]","This long available on VHS title now on DVD is an excellent companion to the LEGEND set. It was made back in 1988, when George Rock, Billy Barty, Earl Bennett were still around of course, and originally lasted 3 hours, what a shame the extra footage could not have been reinstated in this version. But,as it is, the content is a fascinating account of the unique crazy band-leader with contributions from his co-workers and close family. Some home-movie is included and shows (albeit briefly) how colourful the City Slickers shows were. For a life-long admirer, (I started collecting SPIKE JONES 78s in the 1950s),this is definately a 'must have'.
