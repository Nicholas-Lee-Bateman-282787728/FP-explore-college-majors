This is about a man who stars his journey as a member of a wagon train only to become the leader towards the end and it plays just like wagon train except of course without the familier charactors in volved.I am however confused about why the story begins with the main character starting his journey with a new wife and a father just to see them disappear after the first episode with no explaination about where they went, leaving only the three children to continue in the series.

In the US, it was shown as a movie that I saw once and loved.  Rod Taylor leads the cast and is excellent, as always.  Linda Purl has a role (tho is not in the series).  The pilot is good in general, but the part that stayed with me all these years was the little girl of the series family disappeared.  She wore this little pair of glasses.  During a search for her, the glasses were found hanging like jewelry on an Indian's neck.  Good family western that you can actually watch with your family.",5,CONTAINS THE PILOT EPISODE!,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,583,"['DVD', 'set', 'pilot', 'episode', 'have', 'been', 'looking', '30', 'years', 'US', 'was', 'shown', 'movie', 'saw', 'once', 'loved', 'Rod', 'Taylor', 'cast', 'excellent', 'always', 'Linda', 'Purl', 'role', 'tho', 'not', 'series', 'pilot', 'good', 'general', 'part', 'stayed', 'years', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'series', 'family', 'disappeared', 'wore', 'little', 'pair', 'glasses', 'search', 'glasses', 'were', 'found', 'hanging', 'jewelry', 'Indian', 'neck', 'Good', 'family', 'can', 'actually', 'watch', 'family']",N/A

1335951,AY5JGE1SEJNOC,B003BNCMTA,Girvan Paterson,"[3, 3]","'The Oregon Trail' had the potential to be a great series, but only ran for 14 episodes, guess it was a little too late for a western to make it big on TV? Nothing wrong with the 14 episodes made though, and nice to have one of the great Rod Taylor's series put out on DVD! The rugged Australian fits well into the western landscape, and his charming/tough guy personality is always a winner, and, one get the feeling that if you ran into trouble on the trail, Rod's the man you'd want on your side. Yes, the wife was ditched after the pilot episode, but I imagine they figured there would be more scope for story lines if the leader was single?4 stars for a good effort, took one off for a not quite crisp enough picture, looks to be taked from 16mm prints, surely they still had 35mm masters?
