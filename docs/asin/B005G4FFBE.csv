No matter what age you may be this show is timeless.  It is a sincere, heartfelt and hilarious comedy made with such passion and talent that its magic lives on and on.  Whatever seasons you favor the entire run of this show was a gem.  To see it from the beginning with the inspiring friendship between Cory and Shawn as they encounter school and life is not to be missed.  Mr. Feeney of course is the life lesson master here and once Topanga is fully added the entire show is like a jewel shining brightly.  Some episodes were hilarious slapstick while others touched on some very serious subject matter.  The young cast handled it all impeccably and their acting chops developed greatly over the years.  The show has finally been released in a box set but it is more expensive than this bundle of all 7 seasons.  You do miss out on a few added new cast interviews but otherwise all the extras are the same.If you are reading this review you are a fan already.  Any one lucky enough to have been touched by this show knows it is a must own.  Topanga, Cory, Shawn, Eric, Mr. Feeney, the parents and more characters brought in all blend together to make television magic.  I truly love this show and each episode continues to warm my heart and make me laugh out loud.  And to think we have GIRL MEETS WORLD to look forward to, a new show with Cory and Topanga raising a teen daughter, is amazing.

There were a lot a good episodes over seven seasons such as when Cory and Topanga got married in the final season and when Topanga spent christmas with Cory. I also like the prom episode where Cory and Topanga consider having sex. Another one is where Cory follows Topanga to Disneyworld to get Topanga back using Erics advice.

So the discs inside are now just there, moving around as the season is moved.As for the show, everyone should watch this! I can't even imagine not having watched this growing up.

Their development into a (finally) married couple in the end was just beautiful. I enjoyed every up and down between the two. All the gushy family moments were great as well.

1459822,AEBGZ1YSE8LB7,B005G4FFBE,S. Bacon,"[99, 104]","Lionsgate Home Entertainment has re-released the entire 7-year run of Boy Meets World in a massive 22-disc set.==The Packaging==The set contains four multi-disc DVD cases and the outer ""Complete Collection"" cardboard slipcase.* The first DVD case, which hold 6 discs in a few flip-trays, contains the complete first and second seasons.  The DVD cover is the same cover used for the Complete Second Season set.  It also includes a double-sided episode list insert for all 7 seasons.* The second DVD case, which holds 6 discs in a few flip-trays, contains the complete third and forth seasons.  The DVD cover is the same cover used for the Complete Third Season set.* The third DVD case, which hold 6 discs in a few flip-trays, contains the complete fifth and sixth seasons.  Unlike the other 3 DVD cases which reuse previous set covers the DVD cover is a new image (circa season 5).* The fourth and final DVD case, which holds 4 discs, contains the complete seventh season.  It also contains the exclusive brand new Bonus features disc.  The DVD cover is the same cover from the Season 7 set.==The Content==The content of the set is completely unchanged from the single season sets that Lionsgate released, even down to the disc art.==The Extras==Since the content of the set is completely unchanged from single season sets, the commentaries for Seasons 1 and 2, and the Quiz mini-game from Season 3 are still included here.The main bonus for this set (aside from the new packaging and all-in-one set), the exclusive Bonus Features disc, is pretty lacking.  There are only 2 new features, and they combine for about 30 minutes of content.The first bonus feature, ""Back to the Beginning"", is a cast retrospective on the series that runs about 18 minutes in length.  Most of the main cast is interviewed (Ben Savage, Rider Strong, Danielle Fishel, Will Friedle, William Daniels, Betsy Randle, Lindsey Ridgeway (the second Morgan), Trina McGee-Davis, Matthew Lawrence, and Maitland Ward).  The only main cast members that don't appear are William Russ (Alan Matthews), Lily Nicksay (Morgan 1), Anthony Quinn (Johnathan Turner), Alex Desert (Eli Williams).  It's a fun look back with the cast, but I wish it was longer and more in-depth.  It covers the entire length of the show and is nothing groundbreaking (brief thoughts on the Pilot, brief thoughts on favorite moments/episodes/character quirks (e.g. The Feeny call), brief thoughts on the series finale).The second bonus feature, ""Boy Meets... World Fandom"" is an odd feature.  Fans of the show are interviewed and mention why they like the show, their favorite moments/characters, etc.  Thankfully it runs a mere 12 minutes.30 minutes of bonus features on a DVD specifically containing new bonus features is a real shame, even if they only used a DVD-5/single layer DVD (4.7 GB/120 minutes).  If you're going to release a bonus features disc, pack it to the brim!  Seasons 3-7 contain some of the show's funniest and most memorable episodes, and it's too bad they couldn't have done new commentaries and included them on the bonus disc.  I would have loved to hear a commentary for the final episode at least.==To Upgrade or not to Upgrade?==If you don't own any of the single season sets, then this is a decent purchase.  It contains all 158 episodes of Boy Meets World, plus a short bonus disc, and takes up less shelf space than the individual season sets.  It's probably less expensive as well.If you do own all of the single season sets, I honestly can't recommend upgrading.  The only real advantage this set has over the individual sets is it takes up less shelf space.  The exclusive bonus features disc is very thin on extras and is really disappointing.  You won't miss anything by not owning the bonus features disc.  I already planned on double-dipping for this set, so I sold my individual season sets and used the money from that sale toward the purchase of this set.",3,BMW: Complete Collection --- To Upgrade (Doubl-dip?) or Not?,1383955200,"11 9, 2013",2013,3933,"['Lionsgate', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 're-released', 'entire', '7-year', 'run', 'Boy', 'Meets', 'World', 'massive', '22-disc', 'set.==The', 'Packaging==The', 'set', 'four', 'multi-disc', 'DVD', 'cases', 'outer', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'cardboard', 'slipcase', '*', 'first', 'DVD', 'case', 'hold', '6', 'discs', 'few', 'flip-trays', 'complete', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'cover', 'same', 'cover', 'used', 'Complete', 'Second', 'Season', 'set', 'also', 'double-sided', 'episode', 'list', 'insert', '7', 'seasons', '*', 'second', 'DVD', 'case', '6', 'discs', 'few', 'flip-trays', 'complete', 'third', 'forth', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'cover', 'same', 'cover', 'used', 'Complete', 'Third', 'Season', 'set', '*', 'third', 'DVD', 'case', 'hold', '6', 'discs', 'few', 'flip-trays', 'complete', 'fifth', 'sixth', 'seasons', 'other', '3', 'DVD', 'cases', 'reuse', 'previous', 'set', 'DVD', 'cover', 'new', 'image', 'circa', 'season', '5', '*', 'fourth', 'final', 'DVD', 'case', '4', 'discs', 'complete', 'seventh', 'season', 'also', 'exclusive', 'brand', 'new', 'Bonus', 'disc', 'DVD', 'cover', 'same', 'cover', 'Season', '7', 'set.==The', 'Content==The', 'content', 'set', 'completely', 'unchanged', 'single', 'season', 'sets', 'Lionsgate', 'released', 'even', 'down', 'disc', 'art.==The', 'Extras==Since', 'content', 'set', 'completely', 'unchanged', 'single', 'season', 'sets', 'commentaries', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'Quiz', 'mini-game', 'Season', '3', 'are', 'still', 'included', 'here.The', 'main', 'bonus', 'set', 'new', 'packaging', 'all-in-one', 'set', 'exclusive', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'disc', 'pretty', 'lacking', 'are', 'only', '2', 'new', 'features', 'combine', '30', 'minutes', 'content.The', 'first', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Back', 'Beginning', 'cast', 'retrospective', 'series', '18', 'minutes', 'length', 'Most', 'main', 'cast', 'interviewed', 'Ben', 'Savage', 'Rider', 'Strong', 'Danielle', 'Fishel', 'Will', 'Friedle', 'William', 'Daniels', 'Betsy', 'Randle', 'Lindsey', 'Ridgeway', 'second', 'Morgan', 'Trina', 'McGee-Davis', 'Matthew', 'Lawrence', 'Maitland', 'Ward', 'only', 'main', 'cast', 'members', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'are', 'William', 'Russ', 'Alan', 'Matthews', 'Lily', 'Nicksay', 'Morgan', '1', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Johnathan', 'Turner', 'Alex', 'Desert', 'Eli', 'Williams', 'fun', 'look', 'back', 'cast', 'wish', 'was', 'longer', 'more', 'in-depth', 'entire', 'length', 'show', 'nothing', 'groundbreaking', 'brief', 'thoughts', 'Pilot', 'brief', 'thoughts', 'favorite', 'moments/episodes/character', 'quirks', 'e.g', 'Feeny', 'call', 'brief', 'thoughts', 'series', 'finale', 'second', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Boy', 'Meets', 'World', 'Fandom', 'odd', 'feature', 'Fans', 'show', 'are', 'interviewed', 'mention', 'why', 'show', 'favorite', 'moments/characters', 'etc', 'Thankfully', 'mere', '12', 'minutes.30', 'minutes', 'bonus', 'features', 'DVD', 'specifically', 'containing', 'new', 'bonus', 'features', 'real', 'shame', 'even', 'only', 'used', 'DVD-5/single', 'layer', 'DVD', '4.7', 'GB/120', 'minutes', ""'re"", 'going', 'release', 'bonus', 'disc', 'pack', 'brim', 'Seasons', '3-7', 'contain', 'show', 'funniest', 'most', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'too', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'new', 'commentaries', 'included', 'bonus', 'disc', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'hear', 'commentary', 'final', 'episode', 'least.==To', 'Upgrade', 'not', 'Upgrade', '==If', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'single', 'season', 'sets', 'then', 'decent', 'purchase', '158', 'episodes', 'Boy', 'Meets', 'World', 'short', 'bonus', 'disc', 'up', 'less', 'shelf', 'space', 'individual', 'season', 'sets', 'probably', 'less', 'expensive', 'well.If', 'do', 'own', 'single', 'season', 'sets', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'upgrading', 'only', 'real', 'advantage', 'set', 'over', 'individual', 'sets', 'up', 'less', 'shelf', 'space', 'exclusive', 'bonus', 'features', 'disc', 'very', 'thin', 'extras', 'really', 'disappointing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'anything', 'not', 'owning', 'bonus', 'disc', 'already', 'planned', 'double-dipping', 'set', 'sold', 'individual', 'season', 'sets', 'used', 'money', 'sale', 'purchase', 'set']",Boy M World Ssn1 Bndl az
