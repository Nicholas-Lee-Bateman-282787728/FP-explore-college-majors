When I watched it, however I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was.LA Marzulli is an excellent interviewer who listens to the people he interviews, and does not interrupt and try to railroad interviews like some others that drive me up the wall.The subject matter is quite fascinating and a variety of topics too which also made it easy to watch.  Only a few times did I start to zone out when they got into the minute details of metal structure of mysterious things inserted into people after *alien abductions*.  I just was not in the scientific mood to get into the details, whereas some days I am.I almost skipped this and the other first two thinking that number four would be more recent and the only one I needed to watch, but I am so glad I didn't in the end.
