I expected more from Otto Preminger, responsible for The Man With the Golden Arm and Anatomy of a Murder, but then again, he did direct In Harm's Way, a big facepalm, a couple years after The Cardinal. How pitiful that John Huston has roughly five minutes of screen time because he is mesmerizing whenever he appears. That scene when he visits Burgess Meredith is practically, and probably the only, best part of the film. Perhaps he didn't believe enough in the material to stay any longer. Tom Tryon gives a good, decent, but not outstanding, performance. In so many ways, I feel like I am witnessing the priestly rise of Michael Corleone to the position the Godfather. However, The Cardinal portrays none of the merits that makes his ascension worthy. In fact, I am basically seeing one promotion after another for who knows what reasons apart from the skillful use of languages and politics. I guess in order to bring changes, it has to be brought on by somebody with a high rank such as a bishop, cardinal, nuncio, etc. If that's how faith is based on, then I feel sorry for everybody involved. I never knew that good business is of utmost importance in order to be in the good graces of the Church and, above all, the Lord. The Cardinal has a good pace about it, but I ultimately decided that the film went too long by the time Annemarie did her ""woe is me"" spiel. And at that point, to summarize what The Cardinal is all about, I find it a pointless film, resolving nothing much really. Many of the scenes don't really tie up together very well; just a lot of disjointed key events where Fermoyle serves as a witness, and they are nothing new really. Today, the Roman Catholic Church is a gigantic joke and has been in one hell of a decline since Martin Luther's posting of The Ninety-Five Theses. Other religions are not immune to it either.

Melillo ""gloriana""","[27, 58]","Though Henry Morton Robinson's book, on which this film was based, is not the work of a literary giant, its themes (see my review of the novel) were valid and strong. I have no idea what Otto Preminger intended in this film, but the characters and plot of the novel are totally distorted, eliminating the very themes that gave the original merit.Stephen Fermoyle, who Robinson depicts as a dedicated and sincere priest whose downfall is a pride which it takes him many years to recognise, here is reduced to a chilly, stoic figure who seems totally remote. Though the novel also was inclined to excessive dramatics, in the film the very normal exercise of priestly ministry which gave the book some balance is all but gone.Robinson's Stephen frequently needs to confront how his meddling in others' lives has harmed them, particularly in cases where he seems to have &quot;solved the problems&quot; which the others presented. For example, in the book Stephen is crushed by the pain of remembering that his making his sister Mona promise to no longer see her Jewish boyfriend (because it is making the family unhappy) lead to her leaving and ultimately becoming involved with a highly shady character who abandons her during her pregnancy. In the film, since the plot was re-worked so that Mona's fiance decides to convert to Catholicism, then is insulted when Corny Deegan calls him an &quot;honorary Irishman&quot; and leaves Mona, the impact is lost. Rather than seeing Stephen struggle with the raw pain of his meddling, we are given the impression that he hates himself for not allowing a craniotomy on the baby.When Stephen does incorrectly assume he has solved a problem (in the book, with the penitent to whom he refuses absolution, James Splaine and Milky Lyons, to name just three other than the sister whose trust he betrayed), the book makes it clear that Stephen had been perfectly orthodox in the church teachings he presented. The honest message, that orthodoxy without pastoral sensitivity can be devastating rather than helpful, comes through. In the film, one gathers that a cold endurance test is the matter of faith.The entire climax present in the book is equally lost. Robinson's Stephen never leaves the active priesthood nor engages in any sort of love affair. His attraction to a woman (as a &quot;would-be Lucifer&quot; who is only absorbed in what he knows he cannot have, since he never intends to leave his priesthood) is the crucial point in the novel, where Stephen, facing all, sees how pride has dominated his life. The film's &quot;leave of absence,&quot; and apparent consideration of marriage to a pretty student, gives the contrary view - as if he returned to the active ministry as a cold obligation.Since each scene of the film is short and much material missing, the characters have no chance of being developed. It is merely a series of puzzling, often overly dramatic vignettes, as the sphinx-like Cardinal looks on.Overall, this is one of the worst adaptations of a novel which I have seen onscreen.",1,It is a travesty,998006400,"08 17, 2001",2001,3042,"['Henry', 'Morton', 'Robinson', 'book', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'not', 'work', 'literary', 'giant', 'themes', 'see', 'review', 'novel', 'were', 'valid', 'strong', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'Otto', 'Preminger', 'intended', 'film', 'characters', 'plot', 'novel', 'are', 'totally', 'distorted', 'eliminating', 'very', 'gave', 'original', 'merit.Stephen', 'Fermoyle', 'who', 'Robinson', 'dedicated', 'sincere', 'priest', 'downfall', 'pride', 'many', 'years', 'recognise', 'here', 'reduced', 'chilly', 'stoic', 'figure', 'who', 'totally', 'remote', 'novel', 'also', 'was', 'inclined', 'excessive', 'dramatics', 'film', 'very', 'normal', 'exercise', 'priestly', 'ministry', 'gave', 'book', 'balance', 'gone.Robinson', 'Stephen', 'frequently', 'confront', 'how', 'meddling', 'others', 'lives', 'harmed', 'particularly', 'cases', 'where', 'have', 'quot', 'solved', 'problems', 'quot', 'others', 'presented', 'example', 'book', 'Stephen', 'crushed', 'pain', 'remembering', 'making', 'sister', 'Mona', 'promise', 'longer', 'see', 'Jewish', 'boyfriend', 'making', 'family', 'unhappy', 'lead', 'leaving', 'ultimately', 'becoming', 'involved', 'highly', 'shady', 'character', 'who', 'pregnancy', 'film', 'plot', 'was', 're-worked', 'so', 'Mona', 'fiance', 'convert', 'Catholicism', 'then', 'insulted', 'when', 'Corny', 'Deegan', 'quot', 'honorary', 'Irishman', 'quot', 'Mona', 'impact', 'lost', 'Rather', 'seeing', 'Stephen', 'struggle', 'raw', 'pain', 'meddling', 'are', 'given', 'impression', 'not', 'allowing', 'craniotomy', 'baby.When', 'Stephen', 'incorrectly', 'assume', 'solved', 'problem', 'book', 'penitent', 'whom', 'absolution', 'James', 'Splaine', 'Milky', 'Lyons', 'name', 'just', 'three', 'other', 'sister', 'trust', 'betrayed', 'book', 'clear', 'Stephen', 'had', 'been', 'perfectly', 'orthodox', 'church', 'presented', 'honest', 'message', 'pastoral', 'sensitivity', 'can', 'be', 'devastating', 'rather', 'helpful', 'through', 'film', 'one', 'gathers', 'cold', 'endurance', 'test', 'matter', 'faith.The', 'entire', 'climax', 'present', 'book', 'equally', 'lost', 'Robinson', 'Stephen', 'never', 'active', 'priesthood', 'engages', 'sort', 'love', 'affair', 'attraction', 'woman', 'quot', 'would-be', 'Lucifer', 'quot', 'who', 'only', 'absorbed', 'what', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'never', 'leave', 'priesthood', 'crucial', 'point', 'novel', 'where', 'Stephen', 'facing', 'how', 'pride', 'dominated', 'life', 'film', 'quot', 'leave', 'absence', 'quot', 'apparent', 'consideration', 'marriage', 'pretty', 'student', 'contrary', 'view', 'returned', 'active', 'ministry', 'cold', 'obligation.Since', 'scene', 'film', 'short', 'much', 'material', 'missing', 'characters', 'have', 'chance', 'being', 'developed', 'merely', 'series', 'puzzling', 'often', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'vignettes', 'sphinx-like', 'Cardinal', 'on.Overall', 'one', 'worst', 'adaptations', 'novel', 'have', 'seen', 'onscreen']",N/A

O`Connell was a prelate of great personal culture (whose musical accomplishments even included the composition of some fine church music) and of glamourously extroverted flair.Cardinal O`Connell lived a life of flamboyant splendour, but the expenses of his maintenance and retinue (and of some nepotism, too) derived to no small extent from his dips into archdiocesan finances (which were booming, in no small part to his shrewd management, despite the pilfering of funds therefrom for his own extravagant personal and extended family use). Cardinal O`Connell also was a secretive, practising homosexual. Of course, these shocking matters surpass even the titillations of Otto Preminger`s film!For ""the straight skinny"" (i.e., to inform yourself) see, above all, James M. O`Toole`s fine study (one of several in book form), ""Militant and Triumphant: William Henry O`Connell and the Catholic Church in Boston, 1859-1944"" (University of Notre-Dame Press, 1992), which confirms that the identity of the true-life priest turned prelate of the film, is, indeed, Cardinal Abp. O`Connell of Boston. The facts, albeit seemier, are even more fascinating than the fiction concerning this seminal prelatical figure of the Roman Catholic Church in the U. S. of A.Nonethess, on its own terms, the film is highly enjoyable, however much it romanticises Church life and its inner workings. There was a time when the Catholic Church merited the respectful homage that ""The Cardinal"", book and film, rendered to it, before the indignities and degradation of what ensued upon the conclusion of the Second Vatican Council. Those chages were to diminish drastically the life, inwardly spiritual and outwardly institutional and liturgical, of post-conciliar and trivialised Catholicism. Seeing this film, putting aside the personal shallowness of the real Cardinal O`Connell and of his careerist ilk, reminds the viewer of how much the world has lost with the regrettable developments and decline that so have diminished present-day Western Catholicism in ways far more detrimental to it than anything that the real Cardinal O`Connell of history could do to subvert it. There was a time, indeed, when the Roman Catholic Church had, to a large degree, the kind of moral grandeur and vibrant collective life and piety that the Cardinal, other clergy, and the faithful laity portrayed in this film call to memory so effectively.",4,"This Film Idealises What a Faithful Bishop Used to Be, Rather than Who Boston`s Cardinal Abp.

Tom Tryon is perfectly cast as Father Stephen Fermoyle, an Irish-American priest who rises from meager beginnings to the College of Cardinals.

Preminger uses the images on the screen and composer Jerome Moross' effective score to convey the inner turmoil of the stoic Tryon. The film is long and very episodic but is all held together again thanks to Tryon's performance. Raf Vallone is excellent as Cardinal Quarenghi, Fermoyle's mentor.

But I was wonderfully surprised at how much I loved this film.  It's my favorite Otto Preminger film, and my admiration of this film has made me go back and revisit all of Preminger's work, and I am finding that I was terribly wrong about him.This is a wonderful film. It's moving, complex, literate, articulate, and surprisingly thought provoking. The subjects it tackles are still relevant today. The subject of faith, entering the priesthood, sacrifice to God, dealing with abortion, sex, racism, and church leaders and their dealings with politics are issues that haven't gone away, and Preminger handles them quite well without resorting to melodrama and sledgehammer points.The Cardinal moves along at a beautiful pace, and it feels like a grand novel, leisurely, but enthralling. Out of the entire film, there is maybe one or two scenes that are superfluous and could have been cut (the inclusion of a song in a vaudeville theater is one of them), but overall, all the scenes here are valid and tell the story. The film's dialogue is excellent, quite literate and intelligent. The film's score is very subtle, and it's never used as a cue on how to make the viewer feel. In fact, most of the scenes have no music.Preminger's mise en scene has never been better. His framing is immaculate, using long takes extremely well, giving the literate dialogue extra weight by making the viewer really concentrate. Quite often, too much cutting simplifies things, but luckily, Otto avoids that. The cinematography and the production design are magnificent. The film reminded me of, surprisingly, Luchino Visconti's The Leopard. Not in the story (Visconti's film was about the unification of Italy as seen through the eyes of an aristocratic family), but in the production design (which is sumptuous in both The Leopard and The Cardinal), framing, cinematography, and beautiful performances.Tom Tryon, a relative unknown here, is quite good as The Cardinal. He's in nearly every scene and he holds his own very well. Many found him boring, or as least too stoic, but I thought he was pretty damn near perfect. John Huston is great as a cranky but caring Bishop, Burgess Meredith is excellent as a dying priest, and Ossie Davis is great as a black Catholic priest. The scene in which Tryon confronts a racist town where Davis's parish resides is one of the most powerful scenes in the entire film. The film has an abortion scene (which was shocking for 1963, when the film was made), and it's still incredibly powerful and uncomfortable to watch. Some of the film is dated (mostly in its attitudes about marriage and social mores), but most of it is still valid today.The film is not as deep, mystical, or as intellectual as a Tarkovsky, Bergman, or de Oliveira film, but it comes surprisingly close.  Preminger like to choose ""controversial"" subjects, not only because it was good for business, but he really believed in free speech and freedom of expression.  He was a complex man, and his films are as complex as he was.  The Cardinal is, if not his best film, certainly his most underrated. I recommend this film highly.",5,"Preminger's most underrated film, beautifully done....",1211846400,"05 27, 2008",2008,3236,"['long', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'major', 'fan', 'Otto', 'Preminger', 'work', 'found', 'quite', 'often', 'too', 'long', 'self', 'important', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'film', 'favorite', 'Otto', 'Preminger', 'film', 'admiration', 'film', 'made', 'go', 'back', 'revisit', 'Preminger', 'work', 'am', 'finding', 'was', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'him.This', 'wonderful', 'film', 'moving', 'complex', 'literate', 'articulate', 'surprisingly', 'thought', 'provoking', 'subjects', 'tackles', 'are', 'still', 'relevant', 'today', 'subject', 'faith', 'entering', 'priesthood', 'sacrifice', 'God', 'dealing', 'abortion', 'sex', 'racism', 'church', 'leaders', 'dealings', 'politics', 'are', 'issues', 'have', ""n't"", 'gone', 'away', 'Preminger', 'quite', 'well', 'resorting', 'melodrama', 'sledgehammer', 'points.The', 'Cardinal', 'moves', 'along', 'beautiful', 'pace', 'grand', 'novel', 'leisurely', 'enthralling', 'entire', 'film', 'maybe', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'are', 'superfluous', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'inclusion', 'song', 'vaudeville', 'theater', 'one', 'overall', 'scenes', 'here', 'are', 'valid', 'tell', 'story', 'film', 'dialogue', 'excellent', 'quite', 'literate', 'intelligent', 'film', 'score', 'very', 'subtle', 'never', 'used', 'cue', 'how', 'make', 'viewer', 'feel', 'fact', 'most', 'scenes', 'have', 'music.Preminger', 'mise', 'en', 'scene', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'framing', 'immaculate', 'using', 'long', 'extremely', 'well', 'giving', 'literate', 'dialogue', 'extra', 'weight', 'making', 'viewer', 'really', 'concentrate', 'Quite', 'often', 'too', 'much', 'cutting', 'simplifies', 'things', 'luckily', 'Otto', 'cinematography', 'production', 'design', 'are', 'magnificent', 'film', 'reminded', 'surprisingly', 'Luchino', 'Visconti', 'Leopard', 'Not', 'story', 'Visconti', 'film', 'was', 'unification', 'Italy', 'seen', 'eyes', 'aristocratic', 'family', 'production', 'design', 'sumptuous', 'Leopard', 'Cardinal', 'framing', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'performances.Tom', 'Tryon', 'relative', 'unknown', 'here', 'quite', 'good', 'Cardinal', 'nearly', 'scene', 'own', 'very', 'well', 'Many', 'found', 'boring', 'least', 'too', 'stoic', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'damn', 'perfect', 'John', 'Huston', 'great', 'cranky', 'caring', 'Bishop', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'excellent', 'dying', 'priest', 'Ossie', 'Davis', 'great', 'black', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'scene', 'Tryon', 'racist', 'town', 'where', 'Davis', 'parish', 'resides', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'entire', 'film', 'film', 'abortion', 'scene', 'was', 'shocking', '1963', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'still', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'film', 'dated', 'mostly', 'attitudes', 'marriage', 'social', 'mores', 'most', 'still', 'valid', 'today.The', 'film', 'not', 'deep', 'mystical', 'as', 'intellectual', 'Tarkovsky', 'Bergman', 'de', 'Oliveira', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'close', 'Preminger', 'choose', 'controversial', 'subjects', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'good', 'business', 'really', 'believed', 'free', 'speech', 'freedom', 'expression', 'was', 'complex', 'man', 'films', 'are', 'as', 'complex', 'was', 'Cardinal', 'not', 'best', 'film', 'certainly', 'most', 'underrated', 'recommend', 'film', 'highly']",N/A

M Pyles,"[5, 10]","In employing the central character from Henry Morton Robinson's book as a brush for painting a landscape mural of the 20th century, Otto Preminger attempted too much and consequently accomplished too little.Preminger's Cardinal-in-the-making is a man who has just too much to do for a character in even such a long movie.  [...]In taking us along on the journey to Cardinal Fermoyle's fate, Preminger seemed compelled to demonstrate to us that the 20th century was awash in conflict between traditional values and a budding sexual revolution, that abortion debate was in our future, that Prohibition came and went, that the Western Hemisphere was earning the right to demand central billing on the world stage, that the Nazis were on the march (and, boy, were they a nasty lot).In the end, Father/Monseigneur/Cardinal Fermoyle feels more like a tour guide than a man of deep faith who learns first to understand, then humanize, then telegraph that faith to others.  One just has that feeling of pushing away from the table after a very big meal but still feeling hungry.  We get close, so very close, to the feeling that Fermoyle is a truly remarkable man of faith . . . but the fullness of the sensation remains just out of our grasp.The fault is primarily Preminger's, but just a wee bit of it might rest with Tom Tryon.  While he was generally up to the role, I kept thinking about another tall, dark, handsome actor who perhaps could have pulled a bit more substance from the role:  Cary Grant.  The scene in which Father Fermoyle holds up his collared garb and decides on the spot to forsake his love of a woman and return to the active priesthood was poorly directed and/or edited.  The revelation just sort of swooped in from somehwere off camera and went splat on the screen.  By not giving the actor much of a moment with which to work, it called forth more power from an actor than Tryon could produce with his too-inexpressive face.  Again, think Grant.Now -- after all this -- I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Landscape murals are not usually high art, but they can be very colorful and are almost always worth at least one viewing.  So it was with this movie.  It's a good, old-fashioned story, full of heart and color that simply never should have aspired to be an epic.

358210,A11J6CFP5DCBTE,6303118283,Luke,"[1, 1]","I am not familiar with many movies that contain religious subject...but having seen Otto Preminger's The Cardinal (1963)I am was left with an impression that the director did not really care much for religion as for man's character tested againstdifferent social aspects of life throughout a turbulent first half of 20th century.  Having said that, a religious viewer ( especially Roman Catholic one)  should not expect much of a religious epiphany.  But let me not dwell on the message the movie conveys, or tries to for that matter.  Preminger as a film director and as a public person was known for his leftist- liberal views. Great part of his movies deal with topics such as: extramarital relationships, homosexuality, racism, drug addiction, or government corruption...He was also known for his hot temper, especially with his leading actors.  Jean Seberg hated him and called him a tyrant, although he was the one who prompted her career as an actress, and Tom Tyron (the leading actor in The Cardinal) also resented Preminger.  Story goes that, during the filming of The Cardinal, Tyron's parents came to visit him on the set, and Preminger supposedly fired him in front of his parents for no apparent reason but just to humiliate him.  He later of course hired him back to finish the filming, yet Tyron suffered a nervous breakdown that left him with a bitter taste for film-making, which he consequently quit in 1969 and turned to writing movies scripts and novels.As for the film, it is long, so long that it contains an intermission (something not seen in today's movies).  The story is interesting as it takes you through Vatican, Austria, Italy, Boston, and state of Georgia, and back to Vatican during the period between 1914-1939.  It is a journey of a Catholic priest who tries to bring good to the mankind, sometimes sacrificing his own well-being and the well-being of his dear ones, all in the name of his one and only love----the religion of the Roman Catholic Church and its teachings.",5,epic movie and with a one man show,1401235200,"05 28, 2014",2014,2007,"['am', 'not', 'familiar', 'many', 'movies', 'contain', 'religious', 'subject', 'having', 'seen', 'Otto', 'Preminger', 'Cardinal', '1963', 'am', 'was', 'left', 'impression', 'director', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'care', 'much', 'religion', 'man', 'character', 'tested', 'againstdifferent', 'social', 'aspects', 'life', 'turbulent', 'first', 'half', '20th', 'century', 'Having', 'said', 'religious', 'viewer', 'especially', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'expect', 'much', 'religious', 'epiphany', 'let', 'not', 'dwell', 'message', 'movie', 'conveys', 'tries', 'matter', 'Preminger', 'film', 'director', 'public', 'person', 'was', 'known', 'leftist-', 'liberal', 'views', 'Great', 'part', 'movies', 'deal', 'topics', 'such', 'extramarital', 'relationships', 'homosexuality', 'racism', 'drug', 'addiction', 'government', 'corruption', 'was', 'also', 'known', 'hot', 'temper', 'especially', 'leading', 'actors', 'Jean', 'Seberg', 'hated', 'called', 'tyrant', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'prompted', 'career', 'actress', 'Tom', 'Tyron', 'leading', 'actor', 'Cardinal', 'also', 'resented', 'Preminger', 'Story', 'filming', 'Cardinal', 'Tyron', 'parents', 'came', 'visit', 'set', 'Preminger', 'supposedly', 'fired', 'front', 'parents', 'apparent', 'reason', 'just', 'humiliate', 'later', 'course', 'hired', 'back', 'finish', 'filming', 'yet', 'Tyron', 'suffered', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'left', 'bitter', 'taste', 'film-making', 'consequently', 'quit', '1969', 'turned', 'writing', 'movies', 'scripts', 'novels.As', 'film', 'long', 'so', 'long', 'intermission', 'something', 'not', 'seen', 'today', 'movies', 'story', 'interesting', 'Vatican', 'Austria', 'Italy', 'Boston', 'state', 'Georgia', 'back', 'Vatican', 'period', '1914-1939', 'journey', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'who', 'bring', 'good', 'mankind', 'sometimes', 'sacrificing', 'own', 'well-being', 'well-being', 'dear', 'ones', 'name', 'one', 'only', 'love', 'religion', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'teachings']",N/A

It kept me mesmerized to the very end, and more than once I found myself gasping at Preminger's unblinking determination to portray both the dark underbelly of human nature (can any viewer forget the confrontation on the porch with the racists??) and the great things human beings can achieve when they commit themselves completely to an ideal. This film packs a wallop, and can give any Best Picture winner a real run for its money.The film creates its own momentum as it follows one man's growth from neophyte priest to cardinal. But don't be mistaken: this is no mere biography of a religious life, but a fierce retelling of the darkest social episodes of the 20th century, a century considered to be one of the most threatening to human survival in the entire history of our planet. ""The Cardinal"" tells us that one's aim should not be just to survive tumultuous events, but rather to be fully present in them in order to make the world a better place for those around us.Preminger is savvy enough not to portray any individual as pure good or pure evil; in many scenes, there is no easy way out for the viewer. The viewer is not spoon-fed an agenda or an interpretation, but is instead shown the never-ending challenge faced by individuals of conscience who seek to remain true to their ideals and what is morally right amidst threatening circumstances and challenging individuals. Not all humans are successful in this attempt, as the film dramatically shows.This is one of Otto Preminger's great cinematic gems, and belongs on the shelf of anyone who appreciates great film making. The cast is superb (among many notable performances, Burgess Meredith gives an exceptional standout performance), the onsite locations add to the air of authenticity, the music is sweeping yet never obtrusive, and the plot will keep you spellbound.

Doyle ""film buff""","[1, 2]","TOM TRYON has the central role in Otto Preminger's majestic looking film version of THE CARDINAL, but he's one of those handsome actors with an impassive face whose emotions never come to the surface. Instead, we get a hint of what he might be thinking without any real clue. And since the film is all about the moral and personal issues facing him as he enters the College of Cardinals, an actor with more emotional capabilities would have been more impressive.The other flaw is the three hour length for a film in which the story is simply not that compelling. Furthermore, director Preminger has chosen to direct whole scenes at medium length lensing (no close-ups inserted) which gives a flat affect to the dynamics involved. The medium shots are symptomatic of many a film made in the then new WideScreen process with a scarcity of close-ups for important moments.Aside from these weaknesses, the film has a lot about it to commend. All the interiors of church activities are impressively staged and photographed in beautiful WideScreen photography. The performances around Tryon range from good to excellent, including John Huston, Carol Lynley, Bill Hayes, John Saxon and Burgess Meredith.

Otto Preminger directs with his usual adroit perception of the human condition as he tempts the faith of a Catholic cardinal (Tom Tryon) from Rome to Boston and Vienna. Along the way the film tackles such grandiose social issues as abortion, racism, celibacy and Fascism. Co-star John Huston was Oscar-nominated for his role as the fiery archbishop. Catholic priest, Steven Fermoyle (Tryon) returns to his home from taking his vows to discover that his sister, Mona (Carol Lynley) is in love with a Jewish man who is unwilling to give up his faith and that his brother, Frank (Bill Hayes) has abandoned the priesthood. Mona?s obsession to marry leads her to a life of wanton debauchery that results in her death. In the meantime, Cardinal Glennon (John Huston) is determined to drive all of Steven?s false pride from his soul. To this end he sends the young novice to work in a forgotten, frozen parish presided over by the Rev. Ned Halley (Burgess Meredith). When Halley dies, Steven is recalled to Rome where he meets a black southern priest, Father Gillis (Ossie Davis) who has come to ask for aid in fighting racism in his parish. The Vatican denies Gillis? request but Steven does indeed quietly take a leave to administer aid to Gillis? parish. He is attacked and brutally beaten by a sect of good ol? boys and nearly dies. The plot, from this point forward is rather rushed, unworthy of Preminger?s usually sterling attention to pace. One gets the sense that Preminger would have liked another two or three hours to unfold the remainder of his tale which includes having Stephen return to Rome, then travel to Austria to regain is moral center. There he falls in love with Anna Marie VonHartmann (Romy Schneider) who does not know he is a priest. But Steven returns to his love of God, leaving Anna to marry a resistance operator during WWII in Nazi Germany who, unfortunately is discovered and jumps out a third story window to his death. From there Steven barely escapes Nazi persecution to once again return home to his family.  Warner delivers another wonderful transfer. Though the colors have dated somewhat, this 1963 classic sparkles in a nicely balanced transfer. Over all, colors are vibrant. Blacks are deep. Contrast and shadow levels are fully realized. There appears to be little in the way of age related artifacts. Digital anomalies are equally absent. The audio is 5.1 and captures the essence of early stereo recording.Extras include the masterful feature length documentary on Otto Preminger, a featurette of the same vintage as the film and a theatrical trailer.

358231,A12X2J7AVZ04IQ,6303118283,"R. Gawlitta ""Coolmoan""","[28, 33]","Before I comment on the film itself, I must say that I believe film historians have given Preminger a bad rap. His films, even the sweeping epics, were quite personal, and would draw the audience into his own personal world. Preminger's reputation, largely, was due to his desire to confront social issues that often made the audience uncomfortable. Who can possibly forget ""The Man with the Golden Arm"" (drug-addiction), ""Anatomy of a Murder"" (rape), and his most cotroversial, ""The Moon is Blue"" (virginity), a 1954 film condemned by the Catholic Legion of Decency. These were ""in your face"" depictions of the stuff that is now regarded as ""run of the mill"". His handlings of Black culture have been immortalized on film in his two musicals, ""Carmen Jones"" and ""Porgy and Bess"". Arriving in the states during World War II, a misplaced German facing prejudice, he was well acquainted with alienation and filmed these Black-centered films with great affection. ""Exodus"" (1960) concerned the plight of the Jews, and ""The Cardinal"" dealt with the plight of a good Catholic and the many problems facing him (racism, abortion, celibacy, etc.). Preminger was not afraid to tackle a problem facing society, and his films are generally excellent in conveying his desire to expose situations to the world that are ever-present. Preminger's first Oscar nomination was in 1944 (""Laura""), though he stepped in for Rouben Mamoulian after filming had begun. It's the films he made in the 50's, during the McCarthy blacklist period, that made him passionate to move an apathetic public to serious situations. ""The Cardinal"" is one of his best, in many ways. Not only does it cover a long period of time, but it is coherent and often compelling. It was nominated for 6 Oscars (Director, Supprting Actor, Editing, Art Direction, Cinematography, Costumes). I still think John Huston's performance was overdone, but he was a beloved director and this was his first acting role. If any acting awards shoud've been given, it should've been to Burgess Meredith. This was also Romy Schneider's first English-language role. She was a lovely woman and a confident actress. The editing, sets and photography were indeed fine (the 2.35:1 LBX on the DVD show all the glory), but I still believe that Jerome Moross' score is among the finest, though not nominated. Remember, this was up against ""Cleopatra"" for those technical awards so, though noble and fine, it could hardly compete against ""That"" budget.  It was not nominated for ""Best Picture"", nor screenplay...I thought the train of events was handled in a literate fashion, from a very long book. I saw this when it came out in 1963, and was quite absorbed by it's message; Preminger's films did that to me (I was 11 when I saw ""Exodus"" and was speechless afterward. Go figure.) The DVD is very well done, and I'm happy to have it in my collection. Tom Tryon carried the lead role with one facial expression, and, though very good looking, his career didn't last long. He became a best-selling author and I'm sure he's happier. The rest of the acting was OK, but it was really great to see Dorothy Gish as his mother. A class act. Also, Maggie McNamara hadn't had a decent role since ""The Moon is Blue"", so it was swell of Otto to give her a shot here; very good, too, as the bitter sister. This is not a great film, but Preminger's sure and courageous hand keep this film moving and never boring (at 3 hours). There was also so much anti-Catholic behavior going on within the church that I'm surprised the church didn't try to squash this whole project.Preminger has never failed to impress me.

Covering 20 or so years in the life of Father Stephen Fermoyle (Tom Tryon), the film deals with issues like abortion, racism, religious conversion, degradation, and more. Fermoyle makes some wrong choices(allowing his sister to die; abruptly quitting his leave of absence), and yet you can't hate the guy; he did what he thought was right at the time, though he may regret it. The acting is excellent through and through, and the lack of really big names removes the possible artifice of a star performance. Tryon, Carol Lynley (Fermoyle's doomed sister), John Huston (the intimidating Cardinal Glennon), and Raf Vallone (Fermoyle's friend Bishop Alfeo Quarenghi) stand out, but there are no weak links. Preminger directs with a sure hand, aided by the striking visuals and Jerome Moross's beautiful music. The DVD is the roadshow 70mm 179 minute version with intermission.

358240,A3NAK0QG32XFKL,6303118283,"Tefilo de Jess ""Vivificat's blogmaster""","[14, 17]","Otto Preminger's The Cardinal was a movie that I hadn't seen in 23 years, since April 12, 1981 to be precise. It was a Palm Sunday, the Space Shuttle Columbia had just gone up on her maiden voyage and another good thing happened that day that made it special, but I'll keep that one to myself. Oh, and I watched it in Spanish translation, but still, The Cardinal left a vivid impression on my mind and I never forgot several of the key scenes: Stephen Fermoyle's (Tom Tryon), handling (mishandling?) of her younger sister's out of wedlock pregnancy, his encounter with good ol'e Irish church politics in Boston, his facing-down racism and KKK terrorism in Georgia, his inner vocational struggle, his experience with Nazi Germany and Austrian ecclesiastical stupor in the eve of the unification with the Third Reich.Heck, if Forrest Gump had been a priest, he would've been Stephen Fermoyle.The movie is a collection of vignettes in which Father (then Monsignor, then Bishop, then Cardinal) Fermoyle tests his moral certainties against a cast of characters of ambiguous morality. You may even say that everyone else was human but Fermoyle, who always came out as superhuman yet, paradoxically, frail. Each encounter with evil or moral ambiguity taxed Fermoyle's conscience, and yet he manages to come out of all them triumphant, yet wounded. Each encounter leads him inexorably to a promotion.The picture is beatifully filmed on location, with great attention to meaningful detail. Note who, for example, when Monsignor Fermoy arrives in Georgia to investigate a church burning, as he exits the bus that brought him to town, is debarking through the back door. If you're not really watching, you'll agree that African-Americans in the segregated South were meant to be invisible but if you notice them, then this detail speaks volumes. More significantly, this scene was made wholecloth for the movie by Director Preminger; it wasn't in the original novel written by Henry Morton Robinson. You learn of this on the second DVD of this 2-disk set, which is all dedicated to the Director Preminger's cinematic trajectory.This is a delightful movie. It brought back to me lots of good memories. And if there's such thing as ""holy pride,"" through its characters and plot, I can say The Cardinal made me feel proud of being a Catholic even though ""pride"" in other contexts may be a sin.",5,"If Forrest Gump had been a priest, he would be Fr.
