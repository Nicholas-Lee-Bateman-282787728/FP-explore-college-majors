778658,A2TXMYYGSZCSZ1,B0000DHFG1,"annie ""grannieannie""","[6, 6]","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie of the life of Elizabeth Ann Bayley Seton, America's first native-born saint.  It is very well done and is well suited for family viewing as few films are today.While the movie is pleasant and easy to watch, there certainly is suffering in Mother Seton's life when she is widowed while so young and later loses two of her children.  She was a great example to those who knew her.  Mother Seton died in 1821 at the age of 46, only sixteen years after becoming a Catholic. She was canonized on September 14, 1975.",5,A Good Family Movie,1180137600,"05 26, 2007",2007,543,"['thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'life', 'Elizabeth', 'Ann', 'Bayley', 'Seton', 'America', 'first', 'native-born', 'saint', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'suited', 'family', 'viewing', 'few', 'films', 'are', 'movie', 'pleasant', 'easy', 'watch', 'certainly', 'suffering', 'Mother', 'Seton', 'life', 'when', 'widowed', 'so', 'young', 'later', 'loses', 'two', 'children', 'was', 'great', 'example', 'who', 'knew', 'Mother', 'Seton', 'died', '1821', 'age', '46', 'only', 'sixteen', 'years', 'becoming', 'Catholic', 'was', 'canonized', 'September', '14', '1975']",N/A

It's really quite amazing how this ABC television special avoids all of the usual pitfalls of religious films. There is nothing hokey, false, or laughable about it. Although the budget is clearly modest, relying heavily on a narrator to move the action along, this film is neither overlong (clocking in at 97 minutes) or boring. Kate Mulgrew does an amazing job of conveying the deep serenity and selflessness that Elizabeth Seton endured amidst the great sufferings of her life -- and she does it in a tender and understated way that makes Seton's strong faith come alive in a very relatable way. This movie celebrates love over egoism and it is a quiet tear-jerker that will stay with you for a long time after you see it.",5,Beautiful film about heroic woman of Revolutionary War era,1344470400,"08 9, 2012",2012,896,"['beautiful', 'authentic', 'engaging', 'movie', 'average', 'American', 'woman', 'who', 'became', 'first', 'native-born', 'canonized', 'saint', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'shores', 'really', 'quite', 'amazing', 'how', 'ABC', 'television', 'special', 'usual', 'pitfalls', 'religious', 'films', 'nothing', 'hokey', 'false', 'laughable', 'budget', 'clearly', 'modest', 'relying', 'heavily', 'narrator', 'move', 'action', 'along', 'film', 'overlong', 'clocking', '97', 'minutes', 'boring', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', 'amazing', 'job', 'conveying', 'deep', 'serenity', 'selflessness', 'Elizabeth', 'Seton', 'endured', 'amidst', 'great', 'sufferings', 'life', 'tender', 'understated', 'way', 'Seton', 'strong', 'faith', 'come', 'alive', 'very', 'relatable', 'way', 'movie', 'love', 'egoism', 'quiet', 'tear-jerker', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'time', 'see']",N/A
