I was under the impression that the video dealt more with the actual coverage of the events of the historic event but was surprised to see a lot of information on Little Rock's current situation and well lack of ""intergration"". Aside from this it is a handy tool to get the kids more involved in the book and start up some topics related to the book and current events. Overall not bad.",4,Great compliment to Warriors Don't Cry,1268697600,"03 16, 2010",2010,519,"['Got', 'video', 'help', 'out', 'very', 'visual', 'ESL', 'students', 'reading', 'Worrior', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'written', 'one', 'Little', 'Rock', '9', 'Melba', 'Patillo', 'was', 'impression', 'video', 'dealt', 'more', 'actual', 'coverage', 'events', 'historic', 'event', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'lot', 'information', 'Little', 'Rock', 'current', 'situation', 'well', 'lack', 'intergration', 'Aside', 'handy', 'tool', 'get', 'kids', 'more', 'involved', 'book', 'start', 'up', 'topics', 'related', 'book', 'current', 'events', 'Overall', 'not', 'bad']",Little Rock Central: 50 Years Later

It's a great film with wonderful camera work and directing. It's real. I love how the documentary gets both sides of view in more ways than one. I really feel like I understand so much more now about the lack of equality we still face in America and what I learned in this documentary I know I will always remember and continue to think about and try to incorporate the positive changes into every day life.,5,One of the best documentaries I've ever seen,1338422400,"05 31, 2012",2012,554,"['watched', 'Sociology', 'class', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'only', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'actually', 'went', 'buy', 'watching', 'school', 'great', 'film', 'wonderful', 'camera', 'work', 'directing', 'real', 'love', 'how', 'documentary', 'sides', 'view', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'really', 'feel', 'understand', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'now', 'lack', 'equality', 'still', 'face', 'America', 'what', 'learned', 'documentary', 'know', 'will', 'always', 'remember', 'continue', 'think', 'try', 'incorporate', 'positive', 'changes', 'day', 'life']",Little Rock Central: 50 Years Later
1096215,AZNNIVT2R0W0L,B000UR9TK0,T. Bostic,"[2, 5]","It gave you an inside look on then (1957) into more recent times. This High School still has segragation to some degree. The majority of the ""white students"" get to drive to school in their own vehicles & have ""successful"" parents that did college & have career jobs (with the exception of a couple of black students), while the black students (on the other hand) are experiencing poverty, teenage pregnancy, abandoned homes in their residence, drug problems & parents who have to struggle to make ends meet.One cant help but to wonder if the ""HISTORY"" of Little Rock plays a part in its outcome today. Back in the Racist South 1950's, White people denied black people of everything including the right to VOTE, & an EDUCATION. So you have illiterate black people in the 1950's, who were made out to be less than dirt on the ground. They were made to believe that ""White people"" were the ""cream of the crop"", & made to believe their best bet was to stay ""on the bottom"". The police department in the towns were all ""white"", the jury in the courts were all ""white"", the judges...(you guessed it) ALL WHITE-- 99% of the teachers ""ALL WHITE"" as well!Were black people ever given total equal rights even when the laws were passed (primarily due to the Ammendments of the Constitution of the US)?..NO WAY! And you know what? This film is proof that RACISM still exists everywhere, but especially in THE SOUTH. Its a prime example that your hISTORY plays a huge part in your present day & future. The kids at that school cant help but to divide (white students with white & black students with black), because how can they RELATE with each other? HONESTLY! most of the white kids come from well off back grounds, while the black kids are not well off at all. The black kids have to get a yellow bus to school from their run down neighborhoods. White kids get their cars & drive to school, parking in the teachers parking lot. Its such ashame. How things can turn out even though the laws have changed over the years.",3,It was a pretty good film.,1266019200,"02 13, 2010",2010,2010,"['gave', 'inside', 'look', 'then', '1957', 'more', 'recent', 'times', 'High', 'School', 'still', 'segragation', 'degree', 'majority', 'white', 'students', 'get', 'drive', 'school', 'own', 'vehicles', 'have', 'successful', 'parents', 'did', 'college', 'have', 'career', 'jobs', 'exception', 'couple', 'black', 'students', 'black', 'students', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'experiencing', 'poverty', 'teenage', 'pregnancy', 'abandoned', 'homes', 'residence', 'drug', 'problems', 'parents', 'who', 'have', 'struggle', 'make', 'ends', 'meet.One', 'cant', 'help', 'wonder', 'HISTORY', 'Little', 'Rock', 'part', 'outcome', 'today', 'Back', 'Racist', 'South', '1950', 'White', 'people', 'denied', 'black', 'people', 'everything', 'including', 'right', 'VOTE', 'EDUCATION', 'have', 'illiterate', 'black', 'people', '1950', 'who', 'were', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'less', 'dirt', 'ground', 'were', 'made', 'believe', 'White', 'people', 'were', 'cream', 'crop', 'made', 'believe', 'best', 'bet', 'was', 'stay', 'bottom', 'police', 'department', 'towns', 'were', 'white', 'jury', 'courts', 'were', 'white', 'judges', 'guessed', 'ALL', 'WHITE', '99', '%', 'teachers', 'WHITE', 'as', 'well', 'Were', 'black', 'people', 'ever', 'given', 'total', 'equal', 'rights', 'even', 'when', 'laws', 'were', 'passed', 'primarily', 'due', 'Ammendments', 'Constitution', 'US', '..NO', 'WAY', 'know', 'what', 'film', 'proof', 'RACISM', 'still', 'everywhere', 'especially', 'THE', 'SOUTH', 'prime', 'example', 'hISTORY', 'huge', 'part', 'present', 'day', 'future', 'kids', 'school', 'cant', 'help', 'divide', 'white', 'students', 'white', 'black', 'students', 'black', 'how', 'can', 'RELATE', 'other', 'HONESTLY', 'most', 'white', 'kids', 'come', 'well', 'back', 'grounds', 'black', 'kids', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'black', 'kids', 'have', 'get', 'yellow', 'bus', 'school', 'run', 'down', 'neighborhoods', 'White', 'kids', 'get', 'cars', 'drive', 'school', 'parking', 'teachers', 'parking', 'lot', 'such', 'ashame', 'How', 'things', 'can', 'turn', 'out', 'even', 'laws', 'have', 'changed', 'years']",Little Rock Central: 50 Years Later
