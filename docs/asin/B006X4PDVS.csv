It shamelessly squanders the careful balance of realistic characters and relationships developed in the first season. The whole thing becomes simply unrealistic. Too many mechanical plot devices. Too many fantastical outcomes. I tried to brave it through, but finally, the possible resurrection of previously-thoroughly-dead Patrick Crawley was one twist too far. I stopped watching Season 2 after 7 episodes. If you haven&#8217;t seen Season 1, go, watch that instead of this. Enjoy. If you have seen Season 1, I strongly recommend you avoid Season 2 and keep your good memories of Downton Abbey.

1522587,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B006X4PDVS,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[0, 0]","The much anticipated Downton Abbey Special delivered the highlight of the Christmas TV viewing schedule in style. There was plenty of action with the central plot featuring Mr Bates on trial for murder at a time when convicted murderers were often hanged and the impact of this on the Downton Abbey household above and below stairs. However, there was a good measure of dramatic sub plots featuring blackmail, romance, ambition and betrayal - in fact all the things one would expect from Downton!This is probably the best ever episode of Downton Abbey so should definitely not be missed.The timescale here took us from the end of 1919 into the beginning of 1920 so this will be the starting point for Season 3 which should hit our screens later in 2012. Downton Abbey Series 1 attained critical acclaim and earned the series the title of the most popular costume drama since Brideshead Revisited almost 30 years ago - given the number of period dramas both ITV and BBC churn out this is quite an accolade. Reviews for Series 2 were more mixed although personally I really enjoyed it, but few would have had much to complain about with this two hour special. This has hopefully set the standard for Series 3 which we now know will include Shirley MacLaine.

1522604,AYILPD89UIUDB,B006X4PDVS,rioguia,"[3, 12]","What a disappointment in comparison with the truly deliciously immoral connivings of season one! It is as if everyone has been brushed by TV goody-goody dust. O'Brien, Thomas, Edith, Mary....all rendered sweet and sympathetic. The only villains are characters that enter and exit from the periphery, never shaking the moral high ground of the central cast of the high born and servant classes. And I get that the Great War is supposed to be viewed as the Great Equalizer, but the level of intimacy  between the servants and the Earl of Grantham's family is SO unrealistic for the period (although slightly later, just look to Julian Fellowes' own Gosford Park for verification). No one is truly concerned for anyone's reputation, everyone expresses the right contemporary moral sentiments...Even the upright grande dame of Lady Violet stumbles upon the scullery maid  in a state of distress and chooses to use the opportunity to tenderly feed her motherly advice. Yeah, sure, that would happen.The writing is just downright lazy! There are so many instances of facile exchanges that tie off loose ends with absolutely no faithfulness to authentic character development. It is like a TV movie of the week! I think my ""favorite"" one was when the Earl says to his wife ""do you think there could be something I have overlooked about this whole affair"" in relation to his daughter's betrothal to the evil Richard, it creates an opening for exposing the GREAT SECRET that no one could avoid, and his wife obligingly spills all.I wouldn't be so negative if this had been the first season, but my hopes were elevated from the excellent start of season one. But clearly Fellowes must be given credit for knowing what his audience wants (or at least the American version) as the comments here and at IMDB are uniformly positive. I just wish he could have pulled it all off with a bit more integrity.

1522608,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B006X4PDVS,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","Having greatly enjoyed Season 1 of Downton Abbey, I was looking forward to Season 2, and I found it as captivating and engaging as Season 1. In Season 2, the time frame is from the Battle of the Somme in 1916 to the Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1919. For those unfamiliar with the series, I would advise watching Season 1 first as it provides a lot of background information on many of the characters, as well as continuity.The usually robust and confident Earl of Grantham(I love Hugh Bonneville's portrayal of the benevolent Earl) feels somewhat out of place this season as he yearns to be of use to his country, yet all he gets is an honorary rank in the military, and is not considered for active duty due to his age. Cora, Countess Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern) gets so caught up with the rehabilitation hospital set up in a wing of Downton that she neglects her husband which has repercussions for the Grantham's marriage. Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) is melancholic over her failed romance with Matthew Crawley and is resigned to the prospect of a marriage of convenience with another; Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael) takes up driving and finds a sense of purpose in an otherwise uneventful life; and, lovely Lady Sybil (Jessica Brown-Findlay) with her ideals and radical views trains as a nurse.The staff of Downton undergo changes of their own, and experience both ups and downs. Brendan Coyle who plays the Earl's faithful valet, John Bates, experiences some serious challenges when his estranged wife, the odious Vera (Maria Kennedy) turns up. Tom Barrow (Rob James Collier), the footman, is away at war, but finds the experience unnerving to the point that he resorts to drastic measures to make his way home.There is good balance between scenes at the war front and scenes at home. The battle scenes are credibly done, evoking all the fear and horror of the war. But I admit I was more interested in the machinations back home at Downton, and watching familiar and new characters resort to manipulation, scheming, and intrigues. Dowager Countess Grantham is one of my favorite characters, and Dame Maggie Smith's performance is excellent as always. This season sees further character development, not only among the main cast, but also secondary characters like the role of kitchen maid Daisy.This set also includes the Christmas special which is truly a stellar production. The writing is especially good, and the setting and cinematography is quite spectacular. The story flows well and the cast outdo themselves, delivering an episode not soon to be forgotten - it is quite dramatic, romantic, and just plain riveting!It will be interesting to see how this show is developed further in Season 3, especially in terms of what happens to some of the main characters. It is going to be difficult to exercise patience and wait for Downton Abbey Season 3!",5,"Atmospheric, first rate British period drama",1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,2858,"['Having', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'Season', '1', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'Season', '2', 'found', 'captivating', 'engaging', 'Season', '1', 'Season', '2', 'time', 'frame', 'Battle', 'Somme', '1916', 'Spanish', 'Flu', 'Pandemic', '1919', 'unfamiliar', 'series', 'would', 'advise', 'watching', 'Season', '1', 'first', 'lot', 'background', 'information', 'many', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'continuity.The', 'usually', 'robust', 'confident', 'Earl', 'Grantham', 'love', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'portrayal', 'benevolent', 'Earl', 'somewhat', 'place', 'season', 'be', 'use', 'country', 'yet', 'honorary', 'rank', 'military', 'not', 'considered', 'active', 'duty', 'due', 'age', 'Cora', 'Countess', 'Grantham', 'Elizabeth', 'McGovern', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'rehabilitation', 'hospital', 'set', 'up', 'wing', 'Downton', 'husband', 'repercussions', 'Grantham', 'marriage', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'Michelle', 'Dockery', 'melancholic', 'failed', 'romance', 'Matthew', 'Crawley', 'resigned', 'prospect', 'marriage', 'convenience', 'Lady', 'Edith', 'Laura', 'Carmichael', 'up', 'driving', 'sense', 'purpose', 'otherwise', 'uneventful', 'life', 'lovely', 'Lady', 'Sybil', 'Jessica', 'Brown-Findlay', 'ideals', 'radical', 'views', 'trains', 'nurse.The', 'staff', 'Downton', 'undergo', 'changes', 'own', 'experience', 'ups', 'downs', 'Brendan', 'Coyle', 'who', 'Earl', 'faithful', 'valet', 'John', 'Bates', 'serious', 'challenges', 'when', 'estranged', 'wife', 'odious', 'Vera', 'Maria', 'Kennedy', 'up', 'Tom', 'Barrow', 'Rob', 'James', 'Collier', 'footman', 'away', 'war', 'experience', 'unnerving', 'point', 'drastic', 'measures', 'make', 'way', 'good', 'balance', 'scenes', 'war', 'front', 'scenes', 'home', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'credibly', 'done', 'evoking', 'fear', 'horror', 'war', 'admit', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'machinations', 'back', 'home', 'Downton', 'watching', 'familiar', 'new', 'characters', 'resort', 'manipulation', 'scheming', 'intrigues', 'Dowager', 'Countess', 'Grantham', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'performance', 'excellent', 'always', 'season', 'further', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'only', 'main', 'cast', 'also', 'secondary', 'characters', 'role', 'kitchen', 'maid', 'Daisy.This', 'set', 'also', 'Christmas', 'special', 'truly', 'stellar', 'production', 'writing', 'especially', 'good', 'setting', 'cinematography', 'quite', 'spectacular', 'story', 'well', 'cast', 'outdo', 'delivering', 'episode', 'not', 'soon', 'be', 'forgotten', 'quite', 'dramatic', 'romantic', 'just', 'plain', 'riveting', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'show', 'developed', 'further', 'Season', '3', 'especially', 'terms', 'what', 'main', 'characters', 'going', 'be', 'difficult', 'exercise', 'patience', 'wait', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'Season', '3']",N/A
