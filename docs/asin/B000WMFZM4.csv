1110702,A14794N044AML4,B000WMFZM4,"Rolando A. Perez ""RAP""","[4, 7]","This is a very disappointing movie. The acting is barely passable, the filming is third rate at best, and the comedy sometimes looses its point.Ash Christian plays Rodney, the main character, a somewhat overweight high school student who happens to be gay and is looking for his first love. His best friend is a more obese girl called Sabrina, Ashley Fink. Rodney considers himself as a fat girl, just like Sabrina.There is Rodney's weird family; Sabrina's weird boyfriend, a Cuban refugee adopted by an African-American family; the weird Drama High School Teacher who poses himself as Liza Minnelli singing Broadway tunes in the local gay club; the weird British blond hunk school student (the only other gay kid in the school) who goes out with Rodney to school prom, but he is not interested in Rodney physically. I guess the word weird is stressed in most of the characters of this movie.I did not like this movie, it is stupid to me. I did not like the fact that Rodney looses his virginity to the school teacher at the end of the movie. And his obese friend is presented as a joke. One good thing, kids in school did not pick on Rodney.I think Mr. Christian was trying to do too much in this movie, however, he is talented, and the story is not a bad one.",2,Disappointing,1207180800,"04 3, 2008",2008,1261,"['very', 'disappointing', 'movie', 'acting', 'barely', 'passable', 'filming', 'third', 'rate', 'best', 'comedy', 'sometimes', 'point.Ash', 'Christian', 'Rodney', 'main', 'character', 'somewhat', 'overweight', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'be', 'gay', 'looking', 'first', 'love', 'best', 'friend', 'more', 'obese', 'girl', 'called', 'Sabrina', 'Ashley', 'Fink', 'Rodney', 'fat', 'girl', 'just', 'Sabrina.There', 'Rodney', 'weird', 'family', 'Sabrina', 'weird', 'boyfriend', 'Cuban', 'refugee', 'adopted', 'African-American', 'family', 'weird', 'Drama', 'High', 'School', 'Teacher', 'who', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'singing', 'Broadway', 'tunes', 'local', 'gay', 'club', 'weird', 'British', 'blond', 'hunk', 'school', 'student', 'only', 'other', 'gay', 'kid', 'school', 'who', 'out', 'Rodney', 'school', 'prom', 'not', 'interested', 'Rodney', 'physically', 'guess', 'word', 'weird', 'stressed', 'most', 'characters', 'movie.I', 'did', 'not', 'movie', 'stupid', 'did', 'not', 'fact', 'Rodney', 'virginity', 'school', 'teacher', 'end', 'movie', 'obese', 'friend', 'presented', 'joke', 'One', 'good', 'thing', 'kids', 'school', 'did', 'not', 'pick', 'Rodney.I', 'think', 'Mr.', 'Christian', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'however', 'talented', 'story', 'not', 'bad', 'one']",N/A
