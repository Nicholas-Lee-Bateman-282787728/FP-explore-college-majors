Fist off, there is no live singing but its okay because it never was suppose to be a concert DvD. Its has cool footage and the music videos too. just dont expect something that is not posted on the dvd. so if you dont like it make sure you read the discribtion of the DVD before you buy it so you wont be disappointed. If your love Christina Buy it and you wont regret it trust me!",5,Christina introduction show case...,1190332800,"09 21, 2007",2007,468,"['bought', 'dvd', 'awhile', 'ago', 'amazing', 'dvd', 'say', 'missing', 'stuff', 'Fist', 'live', 'singing', 'okay', 'never', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'concert', 'DvD', 'cool', 'footage', 'music', 'too', 'just', 'dont', 'expect', 'something', 'not', 'posted', 'dvd', 'so', 'dont', 'make', 'sure', 'read', 'discribtion', 'DVD', 'buy', 'wont', 'be', 'disappointed', 'love', 'Christina', 'Buy', 'wont', 'regret', 'trust']",N/A

The only differences come in the form of a photo gallery (set to music) and web links.The one disappointing thing I found was the lack of audio selections. It would have been really nice to at least have the music videos Genie and What a Girl Wants, coded in 5.1 channel, but alas you'll have to settle for Dolby Pro Logic on this one.The feature presentation is an extended behind the scenes look at Christina's inaugural promo tour. There are some interesting moments where we get to see how Christina interacts with both the &quot;adults&quot; (her manager, producers, etc) and her peers (her stage dancers) as well as a look at her rigorous schedule.Overall, there is plenty of Christina singing and dancing and looking cute.  =)I would recommend this title to Christina fans, but be wary of the &quot;unoffical&quot; copycat disc as it may not be as polished as this one.",3,Truth or Dare for the Tiger Beat Crowd,951004800,"02 20, 2000",2000,1196,"[""'re"", 'reading', 'review', ""'re"", 'probably', 'already', 'fan', 'Christina', 'who', 'just', 'quot', '411', 'quot', ""'re"", 'one', 'quot', 'I-Hate-So-and-So', 'quot', 'types', 'stop', 'reading', 'go', 'work', 'cynical', 'newsletter', 'website', '-P', 'get', 'disc', 'nearly', 'identical', 'content', 'VHS', 'video', 'only', 'differences', 'come', 'form', 'photo', 'gallery', 'set', 'music', 'links.The', 'one', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'found', 'was', 'lack', 'audio', 'selections', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'nice', 'least', 'have', 'music', 'videos', 'Genie', 'What', 'Girl', 'Wants', 'coded', '5.1', 'channel', 'alas', ""'ll"", 'have', 'settle', 'Dolby', 'Pro', 'Logic', 'one.The', 'feature', 'presentation', 'extended', 'scenes', 'look', 'Christina', 'inaugural', 'promo', 'tour', 'are', 'interesting', 'moments', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'Christina', 'quot', 'adults', 'quot', 'manager', 'producers', 'etc', 'peers', 'stage', 'dancers', 'as', 'well', 'look', 'rigorous', 'schedule.Overall', 'plenty', 'Christina', 'singing', 'dancing', 'looking', 'cute', '=', 'would', 'recommend', 'title', 'Christina', 'fans', 'be', 'wary', 'quot', 'unoffical', 'quot', 'copycat', 'disc', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'polished', 'one']",N/A

I'm not a Christina fan, but I always did enjoy this DVD because it's of course, Christina's first DVD. And this is Christina at the age of 18, looking her finest.

Well, I'm getting used to the newer Christina now, but it's still nice watching her when she still had that teenie bopper look, one thing about her, if you look at her diary, you realize that she really hasn't changed a bit. She's grown much, but she's still really cute. This dvd consists of some songs from her 1st album, self-titled, including Genie In A Bottle, What A Girl Wants, When You Puts Your Hands On Me, I Turn To You(video wasn't released at the time) and So Emotional. They final product is put over the live so she can have different shots during the video, more stuff, less exciting. Also, the Etta James song she always sings, At Last, the only one that's live, crappy quality though, and The Christmas Song in a beatiful room with candles and a guy playing the piano. The dvd is 1 hour and 14 minutes long, almost as long as a short movie. We see her grow up as a child and learn many facts about her. She actually never had any singing lessons before she auditioned to Mickey Mouse which to me, is unbelievable.

To my horror,there were only a  few edited concert footage and they were all dubbed with the music from the  audio CD. For the other songs,it was worse. It was just Christina in the  studio, singing to the microphone all the time with the exact sounds from  the audio CD!!Christina Aguilera, unlike some singers like Celine Dion  (who sings live in the same way she sings on her CDs) , has a talent in  improvising her songs during her live performances. This video should have  featured her actual concert performances - undubbed and unedited!  I am  sure, in her live performances,  she could come up with many new  stylisations in her songs which alas, I did not hear much in this video.  I  did not buy the video expecting to hear the same sounds which I could have  got from the audio CD.The video is really only worth the two songs that  are not found on the audio CD - At Last and The Christmas Song.
