553810,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B00004W4GG,Amanda Richards,"[26, 29]","In my part of the world, Indian movies are a part of our common culture.  Having said that, I must admit that I was never a great fan of the genre, until this movie was released.Kuch Kuch Hota Hai has a story line that is improbable but believable, and it will make you laugh, cry, sing and dance. It follows to a point the standard formula for Indian movies, with music and dancing punctuating the story, but everything is modernised and fresh.  However, even though it is set in modern times, it never forgets traditional Indian values.Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Rani Mukerjee give the performances of their lives in this story, which tells of the true love of three friends from their teenage years to adulthood.  Handsome, muscular Salman Khan makes a powerful but brief appearance.Unlike other movies of the genre, it doesn't have the formulaic ""rich girl meets poor boy and falls in love"" (or vice versa) story line, nor does it have the villians plotting to steal land or money, or committing murder for personal gain.  This is simply a very sweet story, with love, tragedy and comedy mixed together in a blender with great music and dancing.If you only see one Indian movie, make it this one.If you want more, good recommendations are ""Ghulam"", ""Raja Hindustani"", ""Dil to Pagal Hai"", ""Pardes"", ""Duplicate"", ""Border"", ""Dil Se"" and ""Lagaan"", all of which I was inspired to watch after seeing Kuch Kuch Hota Hai.",5,The Movie that Revolutionised Modern Indian Film,1060214400,"08 7, 2003",2003,1416,"['part', 'world', 'Indian', 'movies', 'are', 'part', 'common', 'culture', 'Having', 'said', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'never', 'great', 'fan', 'genre', 'movie', 'was', 'released.Kuch', 'Kuch', 'Hota', 'Hai', 'story', 'line', 'improbable', 'believable', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'cry', 'sing', 'dance', 'point', 'standard', 'formula', 'Indian', 'movies', 'music', 'dancing', 'punctuating', 'story', 'everything', 'modernised', 'fresh', 'However', 'even', 'set', 'modern', 'times', 'never', 'traditional', 'Indian', 'values.Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'Kajol', 'Rani', 'Mukerjee', 'give', 'performances', 'lives', 'story', 'true', 'love', 'three', 'friends', 'teenage', 'years', 'adulthood', 'Handsome', 'muscular', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'powerful', 'brief', 'other', 'movies', 'genre', ""n't"", 'have', 'formulaic', 'rich', 'girl', 'meets', 'poor', 'boy', 'love', 'vice', 'versa', 'story', 'line', 'have', 'villians', 'plotting', 'steal', 'land', 'money', 'committing', 'murder', 'personal', 'gain', 'simply', 'very', 'sweet', 'story', 'love', 'tragedy', 'comedy', 'mixed', 'together', 'blender', 'great', 'music', 'dancing.If', 'only', 'see', 'one', 'Indian', 'movie', 'make', 'want', 'more', 'good', 'recommendations', 'are', 'Ghulam', 'Raja', 'Hindustani', 'Dil', 'Pagal', 'Hai', 'Pardes', 'Duplicate', 'Border', 'Dil', 'Se', 'Lagaan', 'was', 'inspired', 'watch', 'seeing', 'Kuch', 'Kuch', 'Hota', 'Hai']",N/A

553813,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B00004W4GG,Brian E. Erland,"[14, 15]","Note: Hindi with English subtitles.`Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' is a wildly popular Bollywood film from '98 starring three of the most adored Hindi stars in the business, Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Rani Mukherjee. It also includes a small but important part played by the equally popular Salman Khan.Synopsis: There carefree college friends; Rahul (SR Khan), Anjali (Kajol) and Tina (Rani) unintentionally find themselves in a highly emotional love triangle. When Rahul and Tina become engaged Anjali leaves school and returns home never telling Rahul about her true feelings. When tragedy strikes in the marriage Rahul is left as a single parent to a young girl. Will fate arrange a chance meeting between Rahul and Anjali and if it does will romance spark where it wasn't before?This comedy/romance contains almost all of the usually expected Bollywood gimmicks and situations overtly structured to pull on the viewers emotional heartstrings. Also like the majority of Hindi films it has a lot of interspersed silliness and slapstick moments that this genre of cinema has long been known for. While I'm becoming more and more accustomed to this wacky aspect of Indian film, for me it tends to damage the overall emotional affect of the film. That fact is made more clearly in this film than most, especially by the one-on-one basketball sequence between Shah Rukh and Kajol.However all that aside. The music is infectious, Shah Rukh is at the top of his game, the girls are beautiful and there's no denying the wonderful talent and chemistry between these three superstars. Surprisingly, my favorite part of the film is the wedding dance at the end performed by Salman Khan. It's magnificient and worth the price of the DVD just for that one dance number.",4,"Love, Loss And Restoration ~ A Bollywood Tradition",1196726400,"12 4, 2007",2007,1748,"['Note', 'Hindi', 'English', 'subtitles.', 'Kuch', 'Kuch', 'Hota', 'Hai', 'wildly', 'popular', 'Bollywood', 'film', ""'98"", 'starring', 'three', 'most', 'adored', 'Hindi', 'stars', 'business', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'Kajol', 'Rani', 'Mukherjee', 'also', 'small', 'important', 'part', 'played', 'equally', 'popular', 'Salman', 'Khan.Synopsis', 'carefree', 'college', 'friends', 'Rahul', 'SR', 'Khan', 'Anjali', 'Kajol', 'Tina', 'Rani', 'unintentionally', 'find', 'highly', 'emotional', 'love', 'triangle', 'When', 'Rahul', 'Tina', 'become', 'engaged', 'Anjali', 'school', 'returns', 'home', 'never', 'telling', 'Rahul', 'true', 'feelings', 'When', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'marriage', 'Rahul', 'left', 'single', 'parent', 'young', 'girl', 'Will', 'fate', 'arrange', 'chance', 'meeting', 'Rahul', 'Anjali', 'will', 'romance', 'spark', 'where', 'was', ""n't"", 'before', 'comedy/romance', 'almost', 'usually', 'expected', 'Bollywood', 'gimmicks', 'situations', 'overtly', 'structured', 'pull', 'viewers', 'emotional', 'heartstrings', 'Also', 'majority', 'Hindi', 'films', 'lot', 'interspersed', 'silliness', 'slapstick', 'moments', 'genre', 'cinema', 'long', 'been', 'known', ""'m"", 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'accustomed', 'wacky', 'aspect', 'Indian', 'film', 'damage', 'overall', 'emotional', 'affect', 'film', 'fact', 'made', 'more', 'clearly', 'film', 'most', 'especially', 'one-on-one', 'basketball', 'sequence', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Kajol.However', 'aside', 'music', 'infectious', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'top', 'game', 'girls', 'are', 'beautiful', 'denying', 'wonderful', 'talent', 'chemistry', 'three', 'superstars', 'Surprisingly', 'favorite', 'part', 'film', 'wedding', 'dance', 'end', 'performed', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'magnificient', 'worth', 'price', 'DVD', 'just', 'one', 'dance', 'number']",N/A

553815,A36DJJ4Q8WSWFM,B00004W4GG,--corinne--,"[1, 1]","I really can't describe the plot of this movie with more detail than previous reviewers have done & I also don't have the understanding of Bollywood cinema to put Kuch Kuch Hota Hai in context of that tradition, so I just want to add a review that I really enjoyed watching this movie.I've read the reviews that say the first half of the film is a caricatured bright-colored facsimile of college life, but in my opinion the first half builds the foundation for the story arc; both sides of this story are different in tone & that adds complexity to the storyline.  Regardless of the color schemes & costuming choices the first half develops the characters & their relationships, & fills in the backstory.  And unlike some Bollywood musicals, the song & dance numbers advance the plot, something I'm used to seeing in American musicals.The second half is a sea change with more lilting melodic songs & echoed chords from the earlier songs that add complexity to the storyline, something else I enjoyed in 1940s & 50s American musicals & don't see in contemporary American movies.  The bubbliness & youthful openness of the lead actors change, but also draws on the remembrance of their earlier relationship, as the actors become more subtly romantic & yearning in the second part of the movie.  So in other words, if you're watching K2H2 for the first time, don't judge it by the first...forty minutes.Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol are standouts in their parts & make the story better than it otherwise would have been.  Sparks fly from this strong pairing.  It's fun to see the juxtaposition of their characters from the first & second half making the movie one that's fun to watch over again.  I disliked most of the comic secondary characters, but enjoyed the editing that placed different scenes next to each other in an effective way.  I appreciated that the plot pacing was fairly quick too, except for at the end.I admit I do like the makeover movies: Pretty Woman, etc., so that element also had something to do with how much I enjoyed this movie.  I also usually enjoy flashback chapters for the historical depth it can add to a storyline, so high marks from me on that element too.Hollywood hasn't made many movies lately that interest me, so thanks Bollywood.  I'm more than happy to give you my money instead.  Other Bollywood movies I've enjoyed are Lagaan & the fusion movies Bride & Prejudice & Monsoon Wedding.",5,Transcendent.

As Anjani reads the letter which tells of how her parents met, the film takes you back to Rahul's school days and the tumultuous years he shared with his best friend Anjali .  Rahul was a flirt and Anjali, a tom boy.  They never considered their relationship as anything else than best friends.  Tina was the Principal's daughter, newly arrived from Oxford University.  For Rahul, it was love at first sight!  But Rahul's explanation in class about what love is, stuns Anjali.  Kuch Hota Hai!  Something is happening!

He is upset and unsuccessful in his attempts to stop her.  Anjali never corresponds.  Will Rahul's daughter, Anjali, succeed in finding her namesake?  Will Rahul and Anjali ever meet again?

Shahrukh Khan and Kajol are the most popular romantic film couple Bollywood has seen in some time, and in 1998's KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI, their fourth of five movies together (so far), their crackling chemistry is once again on vivid display. Whereas DDLJ portrays these two as basically college kids who fall in love, KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI moves them beyond their college years, and into adulthood and its burdens and responsibilities. As such, their romance here, when it finally blossoms, vibrates with a deeper resonance, a richer flavor. KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI is one of those rare forays into romantic escapism which actually renders you vulnerable, leaves you with a catch in the throat and a moist irritation in the eye. Hell, you might even start yearning (and these are just a guy's reactions; women are guaranteed to melt and bawl themselves silly).This one begins with a tragedy, with a beautiful young mother, Tina (Rani Mukerji), suffering fatal complications after giving birth to her baby daughter. As her life bleeds away, she writes eight letters and asks that a letter be doled out for each of her daughter's first eight birthdays. Her last request is for her husband, Rahul (Shahrukh Khan), to name their baby Anjali.Eight years later now. Rahul is a thriving businessman and a doting father. His daughter, Anjali, has just turned eight years old. Anjali dreams of becoming a famous VJ like Neelam, although she wants to be like her mother more. And because this is her eighth birthday, she receives the last of her mother's letters. In this final one, Tina at last tells her daughter the bittersweet story of her father and of Anjali's namesake, Anjali Sharma (Kajol).Tina reveals that, back in college, Rahul had been very popular and prone to chasing girls. Anjali Sharma was a feisty, tomboyish girl who relished schooling Rahul in basketball. Rahul and Anjali were best friends. But, then, the dynamics changed forever when Tina came to their college. Rahul began to ardently pursue Tina, even as Anjali suddenly realized that she was in love with Rahul. But even as Anjali came to tell Rahul of her feelings, it was already too late. A devastated Anjali decided to leave college, but not before Tina came to know of her feelings for Rahul.Now, in this eighth letter, Tina confesses that she feared she had broken up a remarkable friendship. She tells her daughter that her dream is for Rahul and Anjali to be reunited, in the hope that they may become more than friends.Naturally, this is easier said than done. Little Anjali has her work cut out for her, first with locating the vanished Anjali and then figuring out what to do when it's discovered that Anjali Sharma is very soon about to be married.Yup, it's that old tale again, done so many, many times before - the friends who turn into lovers. And, yet, here, the romance is developed so well, the love story unfolds so beautifully - the unrequited stuff, the anguished longing, the miracle of a second chance - that your emotional buttons can't help but be pushed. KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI will settle in your gut and linger in your soul, if there's even a smidgen of the romantic in you.I rank KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI right up there with DDLJ,Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, andNamastey London DVDas one of the most unabashedly romantic Bollywood movies I've ever seen. KOFFEE WITH KARAN's Karan Johar wrote and directed this sentimental tearjerker, and, for a first time director, he did well enough that the film destroyed its competition at various Indian film award ceremonies.A paragraph now about Kajol. You can tout your Rani Mukerji or your Preity Zinta as currently the best actress in Bollywood. But I'll trump you with one name: Kajol. Kajol is THE actress of her generation. Films like DILWALE DULHANIA LE JAYENGE,Fanaa (2 Disc Set),Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, and this one will certainly attest to this. In an interview, Shahrukh was quoted as saying that Kajol could make love to a cow on screen and make it look like chemistry. Yeah, she's that good. She's one of the most natural, most honest performers out there, simply with not a false move in her repertoire.And she really does have an uncommon chemistry with Shahrukh Khan, which allows them to effortlessly navigate from comedy to drama, from slapstick to tears. There are three highlight moments which tower over all the other highlight moments. There's the wrenching scene of Anjali about to declare her feelings to Rahul, and then Rahul unwittingly destroying her, which then leads directly to the song, so full of ache, ""Tujhe Yaad Na Meri Aayee."" There's Rahul and Anjali's soul-rending farewell as Anjali departs on her train. And, on a more hopeful theme, there is their charmingly awkward first encounter eight years later, as possibilities are kindled and dormant hearts reawaken.Shahrukh turns in a very good performance, sometimes hammy, sometimes heartbreaking. For me, his best moments come up at the train scene with Kajol. I don't count Shahrukh as my favorite Bollywood actor as yet, but he's climbing up steadily on my list (Main Hoon Nais one of my favorite films). And, anytime he's partnered with Kajol, definitely save me a seat. Rani Mukerji also shows off her skills, lovely and sophisticated in her role of Tina. She was still fairly new to the game when this film was made, but, boy, she oozed talent. The little girl (don't know her name) is also very good, but thankfully not too cute or precocious (often a kiss of death). She and Shahrukh have some good scenes together, the most memorable being the sequence with her on stage in a school contest. Oh, and Salman Khan is actually pretty decent here (even garnering the Filmfare award for Best Supporting Actor).Doesn't often happen to me, in watching Bollywood, but the scenes leading to the Intermission actually left me with a sharp, gleeful twinge of anticipation. I just couldn't wait for Anjali's transformation from gawky tomboy to a very beautiful, very poised, and very feminine woman. An hour and a half into the film, and only halfway thru, and it's even still getting better. This is about as perfect as Bollywood can get.",5,"""Love is friendship.""",1207267200,"04 4, 2008",2008,6221,"['wonderful', 'asDilwale', 'Dulhania', 'Le', 'Jayenge', '2DISC', 'SET', 'like', 'one',

553823,A2UJG6T6DOWKQF,B00004W4GG,Jennifer Hopfinger,"[0, 0]","Ah, guilty pleasures--filmmaker Karan Johar is the master of them. KKHH, as it came to be called, was the first of several Johar films, also known by acronyms, that sucked in audiences, often despite themselves, with gobs of sappy love.The film reunited popular onscreen couple Shahrukh Khan and Kajol, who had created a sensation with their previous pairing in 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' (1995) and later co-starred in two more of Johar's films, 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham' (2001) and 'My Name Is Khan' (2010). Kajol's cousin, Rani Mukerji--who was somewhat new to the industry at the time and later became a big star, often appearing opposite Shahrukh Khan--had a supporting role in KKHH, along with heavyweight Salman Khan. Johar's directorial debut is the only film he's helmed that's set entirely in India.The story involves two overlapping love triangles--first between tomboy Anjali (Kajol), big-man-on-campus Rahul (Shahrukh Khan) and the dean's sophisticated daughter Tina (Mukerji), and then between Rahul, Anjali, and Anjali's fianc&eacute; Aman (Salman Khan).Anjali and Rahul are best friends in college. They play sports together and good-naturedly give each other a hard time. Anjali teases him about all the ridiculous girls who flirt with him--she sees herself as better than them. She doesn't realize that she loves Rahul until Tina arrives on campus from London and captures Rahul's attention in a way the other girls at school haven't. Tina is feminine, polished, and hard to get. Not too hard, though, for Rahul, who's a catch himself. Knowing she can't compete with Tina, Anjali leaves school without ever confessing her feelings to Rahul, and Rahul and Tina later marry and have a baby.Tina dies shortly after childbirth, but not before naming her daughter Anjali--after Rahul's long-lost friend--and leaving letters behind instructing her daughter to find her namesake and reunite her with Rahul, who will be in need of her love. Rahul is a wonderful father to the young Anjali, who grows up to become an adorable eight-year-old on a matchmaking mission. Rahul has had opportunities to marry over the years, but turned them all down. However, little Anjali refuses to fail her dead mother--even though the adult Anjali is no longer available.The characters are searingly memorable, and Johar's signature style is set right from the beginning with a film that swept the major awards and became a cult classic.- The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:The Bollywood Ticket)",5,Must See,1287273600,"10 17, 2010",2010,2525,"['Ah', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'filmmaker', 'Karan', 'Johar', 'master', 'KKHH', 'came', 'be', 'called', 'was', 'first', 'several', 'Johar', 'films', 'also', 'known', 'acronyms', 'sucked', 'audiences', 'often', 'gobs', 'sappy', 'love.The', 'film', 'reunited', 'popular', 'onscreen', 'couple', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'Kajol', 'who', 'had', 'created', 'sensation', 'previous', 'pairing', ""'Dilwale"", 'Dulhania', 'Le', 'Jayenge', '1995', 'later', 'co-starred', 'two', 'more', 'Johar', 'films', 'Khushi', 'Kabhie', 'Gham', '2001', 'Name', 'Is', 'Khan', '2010', 'Kajol', 'cousin', 'Rani', 'Mukerji', 'who', 'was', 'somewhat', 'new', 'industry', 'time', 'later', 'became', 'big', 'star', 'often', 'appearing', 'opposite', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'had', 'supporting', 'role', 'KKHH', 'heavyweight', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'Johar', 'directorial', 'debut', 'only', 'film', 'helmed', 'set', 'entirely', 'India.The', 'story', 'two', 'overlapping', 'love', 'triangles', 'first', 'tomboy', 'Anjali', 'Kajol', 'big-man-on-campus', 'Rahul', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'dean', 'sophisticated', 'daughter', 'Tina', 'Mukerji', 'then', 'Rahul', 'Anjali', 'Anjali', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Aman', 'Salman', 'Khan', '.Anjali', 'Rahul', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'college', 'play', 'sports', 'together', 'good-naturedly', 'give', 'other', 'hard', 'time', 'Anjali', 'ridiculous', 'girls', 'who', 'flirt', 'better', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Rahul', 'Tina', 'campus', 'London', 'Rahul', 'attention', 'way', 'other', 'girls', 'school', 'have', ""n't"", 'Tina', 'feminine', 'polished', 'hard', 'get', 'Not', 'too', 'hard', 'though', 'Rahul', 'who', 'catch', 'Knowing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compete', 'Tina', 'Anjali', 'school', 'ever', 'confessing', 'feelings', 'Rahul', 'Rahul', 'Tina', 'later', 'marry', 'have', 'baby.Tina', 'shortly', 'childbirth', 'not', 'naming', 'daughter', 'Anjali', 'Rahul', 'long-lost', 'friend', 'leaving', 'letters', 'instructing', 'daughter', 'find', 'namesake', 'reunite', 'Rahul', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'need', 'love', 'Rahul', 'wonderful', 'father', 'young', 'Anjali', 'who', 'up', 'become', 'adorable', 'eight-year-old', 'matchmaking', 'mission', 'Rahul', 'had', 'opportunities', 'marry', 'years', 'turned', 'down', 'However', 'little', 'Anjali', 'fail', 'dead', 'mother', 'even', 'adult', 'Anjali', 'no', 'longer', 'available.The', 'characters', 'are', 'searingly', 'memorable', 'Johar', 'signature', 'style', 'set', 'right', 'beginning', 'film', 'swept', 'major', 'awards', 'became', 'cult', 'classic.-', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket', 'American', 'guide', 'Indian', 'movies', 'Subscribe', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket']",N/A

553826,A14A4YYKPLYY26,B00004W4GG,LactivistAnti-VaccineLiberal,"[7, 7]","Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, is a WONDERFUL and cute Bollywood movie! It is now one of my top favorites!Even though my parents are from India, my brother and I didn't watch many Hindi/Bollywood movies growing up. At home, my family either spoke English or Konkani (an Indo-Aryan language belonging to the Indo-European family of languages spoken on the western coast of India as well as the official language of the state of Goa, and a minority language in the state of Karnataka and northern Kerala) so with the exception of the sporadic Hindi classes we took as children, we did not have much experience with Hindi.Because we understand very little (just a few random words, phrases, etc.)of Hindi, and subtitles, were not available on the VHS tapes, we had to rely on our mom for translation of the dialogue. Though I'm sure she tried her best, what would inevitably happen is that while she was translating one segment of conversation, she would miss the next one, so there would be huge gaps in the translation, and often essential dialogue would  deliberately (if she didn't want to translate something, thinking we weren't old enough to hear it)or accidently left out.So we had to figure out the story from the pictures and inconsistent, and incomplete translations.As a result, we didn't watch many Bollywood movies growing up (the only Hindi movies I saw in childhood & adolescence wereGopal Krishna,Masoom,Ramayana,Mahabharat, and a couple/few others)I can count on one hand (with  a couple of extra fingers!) or maybe two hands at the most, the number of Hindi movies I saw as a child.But since the advent of DVDs, and Youtube, and online movie streaming, I've started watching a lot more Bollywood (and other genre) movies with English subtitles and I've been REALLY enjoying it! I LOVE BOLLYWOOD movies!Kuch Kuch Hota Hai is one of the several Hindi movies that I have seen and enjoyed immensely on DVD recently.Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (or KKHH, or K2H2) is a BEAUTIFUL movie that stars Shahrukh Khan, Kajol (of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge fame) and Rani Mukherji (of Veer-Zaara) as well as a special guest appearance by Salman Khan (of Hum Aapke Hain Koun)SPOILERS AHEAD!!!In this touching and ""Parent Trap-esque"" movie, ladies man Rahul Khanna (Shahrukh Khan) and tomboy Anjali Sharma (Kajol) are friends at St. Xavier's College. They are best friends, always playing basketball together, and teasing and joking with each other. There is also a deep love between the two that has not been expressed.Enter Tina Malhotra, the daughter of the Principal (Dean), and a transfer student from Oxford University in London, who is coming home to complete her final year of college at her father's school.Principal Malhotra asks Anjali to ""look after"" Tina, and ""take her under her wing"", and while doing so, Rahul comes along, and Tina, Anjali and Rahul all become good friends.But then Rahul and Tina start seeing each other privately and soon they fall in love.Meanwhile, Anjali realizes that she is in love with Rahul, and decides to tell him how she feels. Anjali is about to delare her love, when Rahul confesses that he is in love with Tina.Anjali is devastated when she realizes Rahul loves Tina, and not her, and that her love for him can never be expressed. She is so heartbroken that she immediately decides to drop out of college and go back home -- in large part, to avoid seeing Rahul & Tina together.Meanwhile Rahul and Tina, rush to the train station to try to stop Anjali from leaving. But when Rahul learns that Anjali was planning to leave without telling him, and never come back he gets upset, and storms off angrily. While the train starts up, Anjali throws her dupatta (scarf) to Tina, signaling that Tina is now starting a new life with Rahul.Ultimately as train is pulling out of the station, Rahul has a change of heart, and is able to say a final goodbye to Anjali.After Anjali drops out of school, and leaves town, she ""disappears"". She goes her own separate way, and doesn't write, call, or have any further contact with Rahul or Tina.Meanwhile, Rahul and Tina get married, and Tina becomes pregnant. Unfortunately, Tina develops complications during her pregnancy, and she dies very soon after giving birth to a baby girl. Before dying, she makes Rahul promise to name their daughter, ""Anjali"", and she leaves 8 separate letters with her mother-in-law (Farida Jalal ofDilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge), to be given to Anjali, one for each birthday (from age 1 to age 8)So now nine years have passed and little Anjali who is living in Mumbai (Bombay) with her father and grandmother, is celebrating her 8th birthday. As in the years before, she has a special letter waiting for her from her late mother, Tina.However, this particular letter is different from the others in one crucial aspect.In this letter, Tina tells her daughter about the relationship/friendship between herself, Rahul and Anjali, and how she fell in love with Rahul. She writes of the unrequited love between Anjali and Rahul, and how she feels that she came between them.Tina tells her daughter that her father is all alone, and she asks her daughter, Anjali to find Anjali Sharma and reunite her with Rahul.However, at the same time that Anjali Khanna (little Anjali) and her grandma are beginning their search for Rahul's college friend, Anjali Sharma (big Anjali) has become engaged, and is planning her wedding to Aman Mehra (guest star Salman Khan)But through a twist of fate (influenced by a cute & sweet scene of little Anjali carrying out a fervent Muslim prayer) and due to a problem with Anjali & Aman's horoscopes (which in Hindu custom are often a major factor when planning any event) all plans for the wedding are postponed for several months - until December at the earliest.In the meantime, big Anjali takes a job teaching music and dance at a summer camp in Simla.In a series of twists, little Anjali finds out about big Anjali's job. So she and her grandma join this same summer camp, with the intention of luring Rahul there so that he will come face-to-face with big Anjali.Little Anjali and her grandma concoct a ""Parent Trap-esque"" scheme to reunite the two former friends, set them up and rekindle the previously unexpressed love and passion between them.What transpires is a cute, beautiful and touching display of the real meaning of caring about another person, and true love.I think anyone who enjoys the ""Bollywood style"" of movies will enjoy this GREAT movie! The music and accompanying songs are beautiful, the casting is practically perfect, and the storyline and plot is very touching and suitable and appropriate for all ages, from young kids, to the elderly! It is a family-friendly, Indian version of ""The Parent Trap""!Kuch Kuch Hota Hai is a WONDERFUL movie, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who likes/loves Hindi movies.5 STARS!!

553827,A9T0DBHRUV2N7,B00004W4GG,Lee Jilek,"[4, 4]","Kuch Kuch Hota Hai is the saddest, happiest, stupidest, smartest, corniest, most sophisticated movie I have ever seen. It's dull, no wait, it's brilliant!  The story lives moment to moment with jumps in time and reflects the best in human spirit. If you have ever been in love with someone so much that it hurts and that love was not returned, this story and its wonderful presentation may very nearly kill you with exquisite sadness. The characters are so well developed you live their pain and their happiness. Adults sometimes act like children and children sometimes act like adults in this astonishing celebration of life (aur death). Not everyone wins in this eternal love triangle but even the loser(s) seem to win while displaying superb character in acceptance of the consequences and the winners are reluctantly driven by powers explicitly greater than themselves.Despite all this, the film is light hearted. There are a few overly silly spots in the film but the rest of the time ""something happens"".  The silliness seems to inject pain killer at just the right moments. Only slightly diminished at times by western influence, the singing and dancing is for the most part infectious, magnificent and unspoiled - so much art and beauty on one screen.  The wedding (engagement) dance sequence IS worth the price of the film and worthy of a separate review.In the engagement dance, men dance with strength and precision yet seem to barely touch the floor while their loose fitting garments flow with masculine elegance.  There is no sight in nature that rivals the beauty of these women dancers (in my mind) flowing like brilliant multi-colored grass in a wind that has meaning provided by the gods of music and the drums of man - and what drums they are!  Superimposed on all this beauty and rejoicing is the serious undercurrent imparted by the conflicted bride to be.

553832,AWAL69PY396DF,B00004W4GG,Meeks,"[1, 1]","I think that this film is okay. It's not awful, but I do have quite a few problems with it.The fact that Rahul can just waltz back into Anjali's life after eight years and claim her is ridiculous. This boy did not love her romantically during college (maybe it would have been visible/different if there were some hints throughout the college years that he may have had some feelings) but once Tina is no longer in the picture, and Anjali is gorgeous, he falls in love with her and she dumps a loving fiancee for him. I get that she does not love Aman and loves Rahul, but wouldn't she think that she's worth more than being Rahul's second choice? At least make the fool work a little. Jeez.The only reason they even end up together is because Tina dies and tells her daughter to reunite them because she feels so guilty about breaking the &#34;true love&#34; apart. If she really felt that guilty, she wouldn't have married the guy. I suppose that it shouldn't be up to her to sacrifice her own love for another woman's love, but if she thought that they really were made for each other and felt soooo guilty (enough to name her child Anjali), she could have backed off. The writers made her into some type of martyr after the fact. I think it would have been better if after Anjali's departure, Rahul somehow realized that she was really his true love (and a lot of other stuff happens to make it a traditional Hindi film etc etc). That would be something I'd cheer for. I'm not so sure that this Rahul really deserved Anjali seeing as she was his second choice. Of course it's not his fault that he didn't love her in college but for him to come back and get her so easily just seems wrong.The fact that Aman did what Tina wouldn't do is amazing, but I suppose it was easier for him to do since Anjali didn't love him and Rahul did love Tina. So, I'll give them that. But it was a little much by having him dance at the wedding. What? Not realistic at all. It was enough to have him give her up graciously. What heartbroken ex-fiancee would dance at what was supposed to be his wedding but is now the wedding of his first love and another man? Tuh.Tina writing 8 letters for Anjali to read on her FIRST 8 birthdays? Yeah, okay.So much for marrying and loving once. I guess the point is to show that both can occur more than once, but...With all of that said, I did like some parts...for example, the DDLJ-esque train scene between Anjali and Rahul. I thought that it was cute, and as a DDLJ lover, I expected him to run after that train and I loved when he did. I also loved that there were so many actors from DDLJ present. Anupam is always a joy to watch, especially when he was on the phone with the English teacher (who I believe played opposite him in Mohabbatein as well). I loved Kajol's performance. I'm not a huge fan of Rani but I think she did a good job. So did the young actors! I love SRK and he was good as well, particularly in the second half.Overall, no film is perfect, certainly not this one. If you're into romance, you might really enjoy this film as both parts of it are romantic (first Tina and Rahul, then Anjali and Rahul and a little bit of Anjali and Aman). I love romantic films but in this one, there are too many things that just didn't sit well with me. I thought that I liked it at first, which in some ways I kind of do, but as it went on I just didn't really like where it was going.",3,Hmmm...,1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,3421,"['think', 'film', 'okay', 'not', 'awful', 'do', 'have', 'quite', 'few', 'problems', 'it.The', 'fact', 'Rahul', 'can', 'just', 'waltz', 'back', 'Anjali', 'life', 'eight', 'years', 'claim', 'ridiculous', 'boy', 'did', 'not', 'love', 'romantically', 'college', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'visible/different', 'were', 'hints', 'college', 'years', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'feelings', 'once', 'Tina', 'longer', 'picture', 'Anjali', 'gorgeous', 'love', 'loving', 'fiancee', 'get', 'not', 'love', 'Aman', 'Rahul', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'more', 'being', 'Rahul', 'second', 'choice', 'least', 'make', 'fool', 'work', 'little', 'Jeez.The', 'only', 'reason', 'even', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'Tina', 'dies', 'daughter', 'reunite', 'so', 'guilty', 'breaking', '34', 'true', 'love', '34', 'apart', 'really', 'felt', 'guilty', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'married', 'guy', 'suppose', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'up', 'sacrifice', 'own', 'love', 'woman', 'love', 'thought', 'really', 'were', 'made', 'other', 'felt', 'soooo', 'guilty', 'enough', 'name', 'child', 'Anjali', 'could', 'have', 'backed', 'off', 'writers', 'made', 'type', 'martyr', 'fact', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Anjali', 'departure', 'Rahul', 'somehow', 'realized', 'was', 'really', 'true', 'love', 'lot', 'other', 'stuff', 'make', 'traditional', 'Hindi', 'film', 'etc', 'etc', 'would', 'be', 'something', ""'d"", 'cheer', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'Rahul', 'really', 'deserved', 'Anjali', 'seeing', 'was', 'second', 'choice', 'course', 'not', 'fault', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'college', 'come', 'back', 'get', 'so', 'easily', 'just', 'wrong.The', 'fact', 'Aman', 'did', 'what', 'Tina', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'amazing', 'suppose', 'was', 'easier', 'do', 'Anjali', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'Rahul', 'did', 'love', 'Tina', 'So', ""'ll"", 'give', 'was', 'little', 'much', 'having', 'dance', 'wedding', 'What', 'Not', 'realistic', 'was', 'enough', 'have', 'give', 'up', 'graciously', 'What', 'heartbroken', 'ex-fiancee', 'would', 'dance', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'wedding', 'now', 'wedding', 'first', 'love', 'man', 'Tuh.Tina', 'writing', '8', 'letters', 'Anjali', 'read', 'FIRST', '8', 'birthdays', 'Yeah', 'okay.So', 'much', 'marrying', 'loving', 'once', 'guess', 'point', 'show', 'can', 'occur', 'more', 'once', 'said', 'did', 'like', 'parts', 'example', 'DDLJ-esque', 'train', 'scene', 'Anjali', 'Rahul', 'thought', 'was', 'cute', 'DDLJ', 'lover', 'expected', 'run', 'train', 'loved', 'when', 'did', 'also', 'loved', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'actors', 'DDLJ', 'present', 'Anupam', 'always', 'joy', 'watch', 'especially', 'when', 'was', 'phone', 'English', 'teacher', 'who', 'believe', 'played', 'opposite', 'Mohabbatein', 'as', 'well', 'loved', 'Kajol', 'performance', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Rani', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'So', 'did', 'young', 'actors', 'love', 'SRK', 'was', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'particularly', 'second', 'half.Overall', 'film', 'perfect', 'certainly', 'not', 'one', ""'re"", 'romance', 'might', 'really', 'enjoy', 'film', 'parts', 'are', 'romantic', 'first', 'Tina', 'Rahul', 'then', 'Anjali', 'Rahul', 'little', 'bit', 'Anjali', 'Aman', 'love', 'romantic', 'films', 'one', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'thought', 'liked', 'first', 'ways', 'kind', 'do', 'went', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'where', 'was', 'going']",N/A

But the thing is, I have never been into all this Bollywood movies stuff, exception of that Snakes goddess/gods storyline since that's the only one that fancies me ever since I was a kid.But one day, KKHH cames to my life and everybody, and I mean EVERYBODY, is talking about it. About the love story of the century. It's like ""Move over Romeo & Juliet & Titanic! This is way better than you!"" sort of stuff. Everybody went repetitively into cenimas and teathers just to watch this movie, each time bringing a fresh box of tissues with them.Yet, the curiousity never hit me, until one of our local tv stations decides to air it on tv. OMG! I'm hooked! It is as good as they all said it is.The movie began with Rahol (ShahRukh Khan) standing infront of the burning fire which was cremating the body of his beloved wife Tina (Rani Mukherjee) after she died of childbirth, leaving him and his mother (Farida Jalal) to raised his daughter named Anjali (Sana Saeed) all by themselves. Anjali was raised a happy child until one day, a competition opened a yearning in her heart for a mother's love.On her 8th birthday, her wish came through as she read the prewritten letters written by her birth mother before her death where she could only open one letter per birthday. In this particular letter her mother retell a story of a very close knitted friendship between her father and another woman named Anjali Khanna (Kajol).Back in the days when Rahol & Anjali was still studying in St Xavier's College, they were as peas in a cod. Anjali was a tomboy fits in very well within Rahol's group of male friends. and Rahol however was the Romeo of St. Xavier's College where every girl just die wanting to be with him. Anjali just rolled her eyes and did whatever to tease Rahol, ruining his fraternizing schemes with the college girls.Then one day, the principal's daughter, Tina, transferred from England to study for her last year in the same school. and in an instance, Tina and Anjali became really good friends with of course, Rahol never losing touch trying to fraternized with Tina. Anjali fell in love with Rahol and much to her dismay, and how her heart cracked into pieces when she knew Rahol was in love only with Tina. Worse, Rahol was practicing how he proclaimed how much he love Tina with Anjali, where at first Anjali thought was for her. Anjali couldn't take anymore one day and just quit school.It was at the train scene, where Tina realized Anjali was deeply in love with Rahol and she would stepping away. She also saw how much Rahol loved her as well, but he just didn't realized it, even though how hurt he was when the train was moving along.Back to the letter, little Anjali was crying, touched by the tale her mother had written out for her. Agreeing with her mother request, Little Anjali does whatever she could to reunite her father with his first love. Even though if it meant Summer Camp.Anjali Khanna, however, was getting ready for her engagement with Aman (Salman Khan) in her side of the world. They were set to marry each other soon.Regardless knowing the engagement was set, little Anjali does whatever she could to rekindle the love between her father and Anjali Khanna.",5,Love is a friendship between 2 friends,1088726400,"07 2, 2004",2004,3294,"['Okay', 'growing', 'up', 'where', ""'m"", 'living', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'possibility', 'watching', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'thing', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'Bollywood', 'movies', 'stuff', 'exception', 'Snakes', 'goddess/gods', 'storyline', 'only', 'one', 'ever', 'was', 'kid.But', 'one', 'day', 'KKHH', 'life', 'everybody', 'mean', 'EVERYBODY', 'talking', 'love', 'story', 'century', 'Move', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Titanic', 'way', 'better', 'sort', 'stuff', 'Everybody', 'went', 'repetitively', 'cenimas', 'teathers', 'just', 'watch', 'movie', 'time', 'bringing', 'fresh', 'box', 'tissues', 'them.Yet', 'curiousity', 'never', 'hit', 'one', 'local', 'tv', 'stations', 'air', 'tv', 'OMG', ""'m"", 'hooked', 'as', 'good', 'said', 'is.The', 'movie', 'began', 'Rahol', 'ShahRukh', 'Khan', 'standing', 'infront', 'burning', 'fire', 'was', 'cremating', 'body', 'beloved', 'wife', 'Tina', 'Rani', 'Mukherjee', 'died', 'childbirth', 'leaving', 'mother', 'Farida', 'Jalal', 'raised', 'daughter', 'named', 'Anjali', 'Sana', 'Saeed', 'Anjali', 'was', 'raised', 'happy', 'child', 'one', 'day', 'competition', 'opened', 'yearning', 'heart', 'mother', 'love.On', '8th', 'birthday', 'wish', 'came', 'read', 'prewritten', 'letters', 'written', 'birth', 'mother', 'death', 'where', 'could', 'only', 'open', 'one', 'letter', 'birthday', 'particular', 'letter', 'mother', 'retell', 'story', 'very', 'close', 'knitted', 'friendship', 'father', 'woman', 'named', 'Anjali', 'Khanna', 'Kajol', '.Back', 'days', 'when', 'Rahol', 'Anjali', 'was', 'still', 'studying', 'St', 'Xavier', 'College', 'were', 'peas', 'cod', 'Anjali', 'was', 'tomboy', 'fits', 'very', 'well', 'Rahol', 'group', 'male', 'friends', 'Rahol', 'however', 'was', 'Romeo', 'St.', 'Xavier', 'College', 'where', 'girl', 'just', 'die', 'wanting', 'be', 'Anjali', 'just', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'did', 'tease', 'Rahol', 'ruining', 'fraternizing', 'schemes', 'college', 'girls.Then', 'one', 'day', 'principal', 'daughter', 'Tina', 'transferred', 'England', 'study', 'last', 'year', 'same', 'school', 'instance', 'Tina', 'Anjali', 'became', 'really', 'good', 'friends', 'course', 'Rahol', 'never', 'losing', 'touch', 'trying', 'fraternized', 'Tina', 'Anjali', 'fell', 'love', 'Rahol', 'much', 'dismay', 'how', 'heart', 'cracked', 'pieces', 'when', 'knew', 'Rahol', 'was', 'love', 'only', 'Tina', 'Worse', 'Rahol', 'was', 'practicing', 'how', 'proclaimed', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'Tina', 'Anjali', 'where', 'first', 'Anjali', 'thought', 'was', 'Anjali', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'anymore', 'one', 'day', 'just', 'quit', 'school.It', 'was', 'train', 'scene', 'where', 'Tina', 'realized', 'Anjali', 'was', 'deeply', 'love', 'Rahol', 'would', 'stepping', 'away', 'also', 'saw', 'how', 'much', 'Rahol', 'loved', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'realized', 'even', 'how', 'hurt', 'was', 'when', 'train', 'was', 'moving', 'along.Back', 'letter', 'little', 'Anjali', 'was', 'crying', 'touched', 'tale', 'mother', 'had', 'written', 'out', 'Agreeing', 'mother', 'request', 'Little', 'Anjali', 'could', 'reunite', 'father', 'first', 'love', 'Even', 'meant', 'Summer', 'Camp.Anjali', 'Khanna', 'however', 'was', 'getting', 'ready', 'engagement', 'Aman', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'side', 'world', 'were', 'set', 'marry', 'other', 'soon.Regardless', 'knowing', 'engagement', 'was', 'set', 'little', 'Anjali', 'could', 'rekindle', 'love', 'father', 'Anjali', 'Khanna']",N/A

(The clothes, people the clothes! Doesn't it make you laugh to think , we actually used to wear stuff like that? And yes, I realize in a few years, I'll probably be saying that about what I'm wearing now.) Anyway, the first half was a little hard for me, though it has some wonderful scenes. I like when SRK sneaks into Rani's bedroom, and when SRK and Kajol wish on a star together. And when SRK a.k.a. Rahul tells Kajol a.k.a. Anjali that he loves Rani a.k.a. Tina, well done! (Was that a little confusing to anyone else? And I wrote it!) But at the same time, I was rooting a bit too much for Anjali, and not enough for Tina that it made it hard to be even a little happy when they got together. Know what I mean? But I can understand, how Tina would want for Rahul to be happy when she was gone, and especially with Anjali whom she knew he already loved. I just wish she would have had the courage to tell him no before they got married and she died. And then he could have realized 'how wrong he was and discovered his true love for Ajali' like 8 years earlier. And we wouldn't have had to break poor Aman's heart too. And don't you think that Aman and Tina would have been a good pair? But too bad, she died. In the end I was very glad that Anjali got who she wanted the whole time, but yeah, I just sort of wanted to slap Rahul for being a little too spoilt.(I really hated the snapping scene.)  He didn't really deserve what he got. But, the songs were great. Dancing was great. Especially the engagement dance. Hello, athletic! The little pavilion scene was very touching. I loved Anjali. This was the first real Bollywood movie that my little sister saw and she loved it. I probably would have liked it more if I hadn't seen DDLJ first, which seemed on the whole more complete to me.

I'm glad to see that Amazon is starting to provide Bollywood films.  I knew after ""Lagaan"", ""Monsoon Wedding"", and ""Bend it Like Beckham"" came out, people are going to want to see more Indian films.This is a story about Rahul and Anjali, a boy and a girl who were best of friends back in college.  This movie opens with a woman named Tina who is dying from a complicated birth.  She asks her husband Rahul, while before she dies, to name their new daughter Anjali, and she also gives the grandmother 8 letters that she wrote to give to the newborn daughter, one letter for each year of the daughter's birthday.  It is on Anjali's eighth birthday that she received the eighth letter written by her long gone dead mother.  In this eighth letter, Anjali's mother Tina explained how she came into her father's life back in college and they fell in love.  This love complicated a friendship between her father Rahul, and his best friend at college, a tomboy girl named Anjali.  So Anjali left the college so that Tina and Rahul could be together.  What little Anjali's mother wants her daughter to do is find the first Anjali and bring her back together with her father so that he will find happiness once again with his original best friend from college.  This movie is a roller coaster of emotions.  You will laugh and you will cry.  In fact, you will probably cry twice within the first 15 minutes, but yet, you will laugh and be so engrossed into this film that you will wish you were there.  It would be nice if this film had about 4 less songs because it does get a bit too musical sometimes, but the song videos do all look really colorful and classy.This movie stars Shahrukh Khan, Kajol, and Rani Mukherjee.  You will love all three of these Indian stars right away.  These three stars also star together in another Bollywood film that I recommend called ""Kabhi Khushi Khabhie Gham"".

I like romance movies anyway, but when they contain Indian song and dance numbers, all the better!The movie begins with Rahul burning the body of his now deceased wife, Tina, in a traditional Indian/Hindu funeral. Then we're shown scenes of Tina's last few moments with Rahul before she dies. On her death bed she leaves 8 letters to Anjali, the little girl that she has just given birth to, one for each of her first 8 birthdays.Fast forward 8 years to Anjali's 8th birthday as she opens her final letter. In the letter, and during the rest of this half of the movie, we're shown how Rahul and Tina met and fell in love, but the story is not so much about Tina as it is Anjali, his best friend from college that he gave up in order to be with Tina. Rahul and Anjali are both into sports pretty hardcore and are always playing against eachother and trying to beat the other. However, they are nothing more than friends.Things are going good until the Principal's daughter, Tina shows up and Rahul falls in love with her. Anjali, realizes she has feelings for Rahul but can't bring herself to tell him. As Rahul and Tina grow increasingly closer, Anjali feels left out and her feelings for Rahul only increase. It's impossible for her to compete with Tina as Tina is beautiful, feminine, and graceful, while she is plain, boisterous, and a tomboy.Soon the title song is performed and it is truly awesome. ""Kuch Kuch Hota Hai"" roughly translated means: ""Something happens in my heart."" This is how Rahul explains to Anjali how he will know when he's met the right girl.tum paas aa'e, yuu.n muskaraa'eYou came near me -tum ne na jaane kya, sapane dikhaa'eyou had no idea what dreams you revealed to me.ab to mera dil, jaage na sota haiNow my heart is neither awake nor asleep.kya karuu.n haa'e, kuchh kuchh hota haiWhat shall I do?  Something happens (in my heart).After dressing up for Rahul fails, Anjali tries one last time to tell him how she feels but Rahul tells her that he loves Tina before she can even say anything. She finally gives up and leaves college, no longer able to face him. This letter from Tina to her daughter, Anjali, ends with a commission: she must get Rahul and adult-Anjali to meet up again and fall in love!Even though an hour and a half of movie has passed, we're still only half way through this baby, as most Bollywood films are about 3 hours long. Be sure to check out this classic film to see little-Anjali's attempts at making Rahul and adult-Anjali fall in love. At one point Allah himself intervenes on Anajli's behalf. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll fall in love all over again.Oh, there is this one really great line, later on while Anjali and Rahul are playing charades, Rahul has to act out the phrase, ""I love you,"" but he can't do it. Anjali says to him, ""You couldn't do that much? We could have won.""

Just bought it on blu-ray directly through Amazon, the songs are great, and of course, so is Shah Rukh, Kajol, and Rani Mukherji. This is the typical Bollywood movie, and if you're a Shah Rukh Khan fan like me, you have to see it! It does have some swearing, which I thought I would mention in case there is anyone who is sensitive about that. But it is a really cute movie still.",5,Kuch Kuch Hota Hai,1296950400,"02 6, 2011",2011,397,"['Love', 'movie', 'Just', 'bought', 'blu-ray', 'directly', 'Amazon', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'course', 'so', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Kajol', 'Rani', 'Mukherji', 'typical', 'Bollywood', 'movie', ""'re"", 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'fan', 'have', 'see', 'have', 'swearing', 'thought', 'would', 'mention', 'case', 'anyone', 'who', 'sensitive', 'really', 'cute', 'movie', 'still']",N/A
553850,AOUFNKPTMAIHO,B00004W4GG,vent,"[0, 0]","GREAT FAMILY film , Karan Johar really delivers in his debut direction , writing and overall great choice of actors. Chemistry , beauty, comedy, romance, all present and accounted for by  SRK , Kajol & Rani Mukerji. Salman Khan has an extended cameo and does very well in it. This is Bollywood so along the way you are still going to have the school dance/talent show singing and the summer camp singing and a couple of other songs for the emotions but hey this IS BOLLYWOOD and I have grown to love it.Sweet tale of friendship between young man and young girl at college. The young girl is played by Kajol as a bit of a tomboy who loves sports and never thinks of romance ; She's too busy beating SRK at basketball. Along comes Rani Mukerji in fashionable clothes and gorgeous makeup and steals her ""boyfriend"" away. Too late she realizes what he meant to her and heartbroken she walks away. The second half of the movie is done at first through the vantage point of a young girl named Anjali who's mother died when she was a few weeks old. Her mother wrote her several letters to be opened one for each year on her birthday. Her 8th birthday letter has her opening her mother and father's love story and how they met;and how Anjali got her name. She is told that her father will always love his first best friend Anjali. That she needs to try and get her dad to try to love again.Find Anjali and get them together before it's too late. Will she succeed in the nick of time. She best hurry Anjali's getting engaged to Salman. With the help of Grandma and a very fun summer camp and even Salman Khan, she should be able to achieve her grandmas dream of a complete family again. Somewhere along the way kuch kuch hota hai.There  is an excellent story written here with fantastic normal sounding dialogues and music. No freakish people thrown in at weird times with supposed jokes, just great acting that feels so 1950's MGM musical you don't want to turn of the dvd player as strange as that sounds. Fun scenes for the kids. Age 8 and above ought to be able to understand the movie but 10 and up for more enjoyment and understanding  of the dialogue. This is Bollywood at it's best and considering Karan Johar wrote a timeless film that looks as if it were done just yesterday and pulled that off in 1996 that's saying something. Compare other bolly's from this time period and they fall flat on their face . This one floats like cream to the top.
