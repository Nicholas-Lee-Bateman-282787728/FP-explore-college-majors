Seaason 8 went back to 50 minute episodes in black and white.This would be acceptable except that the stories are horrible!  Duke is gone and Barney has a much bigger role because of it.  Michael Burns is a good actor but he shouldn't be such a main character.  He can't hold up to Duke and Cooper Smith.  I only made it through the first 5 discs then sold the set at a used DVD store.The guest stars are no longer big name high quality actors.  They are second rate.  The stories can border on ridiculous.  Charlie and Barnaby flying around with big feathers in a too long dream sequence was just stupid.  The dead ghost girl crying over and over and over got very annoying.  Barney and his bloody palms after shooting a man.I hate to submit this review but maybe I can save a Wagon Train fan some money.

1636156,A273D8M7DVZ7FL,B00BNADXSC,Renee Fineberg,"[2, 3]","Wagon Train was one of the finest western series to be shown during the 1950's and 1960's...it lasted for 8 seasons.  It had great stars, guests, writers, and directors.  It was terrific to watch. Once in a while, the story was silly and implausible, but for the most part, it was very well-done.  John McIntire was one of the best character actors around and he held all the different elements together.McIntire also appeared several times on Laramie....and every role was different.  Robert Fuller joined Wagon Train in the 7th season after Laramie ended.  His character of Cooper Smith was very much like the Jess Harper character of Laramie.  But Fuller is a good actor and carried weight on the show.  Scott Miller and the supporting cast of characters added humor, drama, and conflict.  Shows like Wagon Train are not around any more....westerns fell out of favor.  Today we are inundated with tasteless reality shows about tasteless celebrities.  The quality shows are on cable stations and are not always available to the average viewer except if one is willing to pay to see them.  The DVD's make it possible to see one of the best shows of a bygone era.
