1032973,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000KB48AM,Grady Harp,"[8, 11]","For those of us who found much to admire and appreciate in Eric Eason's 2002 little powerhouse of a film MANITO that placed Franky G in the limelight as a sound actor inside that hunky exterior, the release of JOURNEY TO THE END OF THE NIGHT held much promise.  Unfortunately with  moving into the arena of 'major features' with popular big actors in a script that is deeply in need of surgery proves a step too quickly taken.  While it is easy to see Eason's intentions in this very dark (literally!) film, it is compulsively doctored with phony 'reality ideas' that misfire.The basic story is a family of Americans who are deeply involved in the crime scene (brothels) of So Paulo, Brazil, intricately bound in their crime acts but both planning to escape the quagmire of the dingy life of the city and return to America.  The father Sinatra (Scott Glenn) is living with Angie (Catalina Sandino Moreno - the star of 'Maria Full of Grace') and they have a small child: Sinatra's son Paul (Brendan Fraser) is also in love with Angie and plans an escape from the dregs of Sao Paulo after he manages to work a drug pass engineered by his father. The sale is to Nigerians who speak Yoruba and when the 'messenger' meant to pass the drugs for the money abruptly dies in a brothel with a transgender prostitute, the panic begins: who can make the pass that night? Sinatra hires a Nigerian, Yoruba speaking dishwasher Wemba (Mos Def) who agrees to take the drugs to the drop site and it seems Wemba is the only decent character to keep his bargain and his word.  Paul is enraged with the death of the original middleman and ends up disfiguring the prostitute present at his death.  The drug deal falls into problems, Paul is unable to convince Angie to stand by him (which mean leaving Paul's father and the possible endangerment of her son), and things bog down plot-wise so that story ultimately ends with the only persons to care about are Angie and Wemba.Eason makes his story all happen in one night and the constant factor is a greenish darkness that hides almost everything - and that may be a good thing!  The script is Swiss cheese, the acting is for the most part sadly directed, the cast is poorly chosen, and the only real redeeming factor is the chance to watch Mos Def continue to flesh out his career with well executed character roles.  Eric Eason holds much promise as a director (he was the awarded best emerging filmmaker by first annual Tribeca Film Festival in New York City in 2002), so perhaps this excursion into the 'big screen realm' can be forgiven as overstepping his material.  In the end JOURNEY TO THE END OF THE NIGHT is hopefully just a sidestep for a director who obviously has considerable talent.

BUT, I'm sorry I did.  I did NOT like to see them playing these slimy characters - I got no enjoyment from this at all. It's an UGLY story. (Guess ""gritty"" means ""ugly"")Glenn is an old pimp and club owner in Brazil.  Not sure what he did in the USA but he's not allowed back.  By chance, a very large suitcase full of drugs landed in his lap and gives him the opportunity to leave with his wife and small child to live in a warmer climate and nice area and be able to send his child to college. And his older son from his first marriage (Fraser) will get his club and the whores.  (Fraser could stay and make a living or sell it and return to the states and make a fresh start).Fraser is his disgusting junkie, gambling low-life son. He is in love with Glenn's wife and her child is actually his.  He is planning to double cross his dad, take all the money from the drug sale and head off somewhere with her and the boy - leaving behind his serious gambling debts and his father.  Not caring if he has to kill his own father to do this, and certainly not caring who else dies in the process.  He is total slime looser scum in this movie, and I really hated seeing him in this role.Mos Def is a good guy and works as a dishwasher in Glenns club. He kept his nose clean and was going to school to become a bookkeeper. (At least the movie gives us 1 decent person.)Glenn's intended drug mule for the deal unexpectedly dies of a heart attack while doing a transvestite hooker, and the person the deal is with will ONLY do the deal with someone from his own country, which it turns out Def is.  Glenn presents the situation/opportunity (unthreateningly) to Def and he agrees to it, understanding his cut in the deal would mean he would never have to wash another dish or return to whatever hole he was from.Overall, I did not appreciate this movie and I would not recommend it.  This had crime and slime but no thrills.

I was a little concerned, but once again, I'm on a spree to see every single movie that Mos Def was in, so I hoped that he knew what he was doing when he picked this role. I shook my head when he started speaking in a Nigerian accent. That cat loves to speak in any accent but his own Brooklyn drawl, and even better, he does it so well.  I wonder how people from South Africa would judge his accent because I thought it was on point (from my inexperienced viewpoint). Anyway, the movie is basically about five main characters who are trying to turn their lives around, but in every possible way, destiny is toying with their future as a drug deal goes on. The only character who seems to know how things will end is a psychic dude who is about as cool as he wants to be just from sitting in a chair.  Every single person in this movie was perfect for their roles, and I love that they actually went to South Africa instead of setting up scenes. The grittiness, the temperature, the darkness, and even the extras could not have been any more authentic.  This is the perk of going to the land where the film should be set. I love that the director picked out people who'd never acted in their lives because it gave new people a chance to act, and boy, did they do a great job.  Of course Mos did not disappoint me, and I really enjoyed his character throughout the film.  I was tickled by the bookkeeper/accounting debater, as well as the conversation at the desk between father and son. Although I initially had distaste for the bad guys, the film laced their actions together so then I was confused about who REALLY was the bad guys. I closed my eyes during the dog scene--I didn't want to see the result of that at all, and I could've gone without the n-word coming out of one character's mouth, but so be it. That's probably realistic to what a character like him would've said anyway. In all actuality, none of them were really bad guys. They were just people who were acting like human beings who make mistakes.

The film is about a web of characters affected by a drug deal plan engineered by a brothel owner Sinatra played by Scott Glen. He intends to get out of the place with his young wife Angie (Catalina Sandino Moreno) and 5-year-old son, but his simple plan goes awry when his trusted messenger suddenly dies.Though his disgruntled son Paul (Brendan Fraser) strongly disagrees, Sinatra chooses Wemba (Mos Def), an immigrant from Nigeria washing dishes in the kitchen, as a new man in charge of the transaction. The fact is, Paul has been contemplating, in his own way, the idea of starting a new life.You may think ""Journey"" is a multi-layered, intense drama like ""City of God"" (in which Alice Braga also appeared). Actually, Eric Eason-directed thriller is more like a noir with a bit of Greek tragedy set in the underworld of the Brazilian city. (There is one blind soothsayer predicting the future.) Interestingly, according to the internet site IMDb, the film was shot in Brazil, but we don't see the point of setting the plot in Sao Paulo when the story mostly takes place during the night and we can see very little of the city.The storyline and characters are not very credible, lacking the details and back stories. The story has certainly twists and turns, as well as actions, but they are not thrilling when the plot is full of holes and incredible decisions on the side of main characters.Actors are doing their best and Brendan Fraser delivers strong acting as the desperate anti-hero, but his fans may not like the character he plays. The most impressive is Mos Def, who quietly steals every scene he is in.
