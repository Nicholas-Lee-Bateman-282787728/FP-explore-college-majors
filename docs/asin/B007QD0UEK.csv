More specifically, a Manhattan couple who cope with the impending Apocalypse and we follow their story.While I, too, appreciate the fact that this movie scales things back quite abitand doesn't makes things big and overdramatic; I wish that this movie would have made things just a tad more exciting. I like the fact that the movie is a more personal look at the coming of the end but there was something about it that just didn't gel with me. Not that I have to have everything laid out to me and explained in the movie but it would have made things more believable if I knew exactly how and why the end was coming...and, at the very least, see it happen at the end.Don't get me wrong, the movie isn't as bad as it might seem. It's just not what you'd make it out to be if it were the last day we were to live or, as I stated earlier, as exciting.

watching him for decades,  he is an acquired taste. he is very arty, surreal, visual.  he likes ideas and exploring them to the nth degree.  i thought he did a very good job of ahowing how people might act on the last day of the world.  there are scenes which i think are very right on and then others that are off.  i will discuss each grouping.the off scenes: people still reporting for work, such as driving taxis, clerking at convenience stores, delivering food from restaurants.  i don't think anyone would be working on the last day  well, let me amend that.  there is one news anchor who states he can't imagine any finer way to finiish than doing a last broadcast.  that i believed. there is also an incredible amount of noise coming from their street.  this is the bustle of a busy city with sirens and congestion.  i think it would be considerably more silent as far as those kinds of sounds, but these are not major scenes and ferrara does a much better job on the bigger scenes.the right on scenes:  people are skypeing one another primarily with apple computers. they want to see one another one last time. a guy simply walks out onto his fire escape and jumps, ending his life before the end comes. cisco, willem defoe, tells his ex-wife that he has always really loved her and he was really confused during the divorce.  this his second, young wife, sky, overhears and goes ballistic. sky paints her way through the last day on a large canvas on the floor.  she paints most of what she is feeling. she does the last of it in her favorite evening gown. cisco takes a last walk through the city streets and many people are drinking or partying one last time. cisco almost chickens out and kills himself before the end.  the tv plays constantly of various leaders who were interviewed at the time they learned of the last day.the last ten minutes of the movie ferrara unleashes his considerable visual talent to give us a montage of images for the end of the world.  i thought these were greati did think the movie opened slowly and with a very long explicit lovemaking scene between cisco and skye.  i found that rather boring after the first few minutes and probably would have turned it off if i hadn't seen ferrara before.  somehow in the first twenty minutes of the movie he seems to have forgotten everything he knew about pacing.  but he recovers and i started to enjoy it then.defoe is a long time favorite actor of farrerra's as is harvey keitel and christopher walken.  before you write him off, you should try some of his film which feature these actors.",4,abel ferrara is an acquired taste,1347321600,"09 11, 2012",2012,2701,"['i', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'abel', 'ferrara', 'film', 'i', 'might', 'have', 'hated', 'as', 'much', 'everyone',

1536130,A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF,B007QD0UEK,G. Teslovich,"[2, 4]","It's interesting looking back over the decades how apocalyptic movies come in and out of favor and the methodology of the end seems to go through it's periods of popularity. Volcanos, earthquakes, war, disease, floods, aliens, anything from space, etc. In this case, in tune with the times, it's human generated climate change. And, as in the past, the science is Hollywood middle school fantasy. OK, so your'e saying that's not important because it's just a vehicle for some deeper message. The message in part, as in these similar movies, ""Another Earth"" and ""Melancholia"", is that love makes the end tolerable. What's not clear in ""4:44"" and in ""Another Earth"" is why the writers are enamored with older males manipulating much younger females. That message aside, most of the movie has a preachy documentary feel with nearly half filled with scenes of televised speakers espousing pop views of humans negatively impacting the environment of Earth. The other half is mostly composed of, what seemed like, overly contrived responses by people to knowing that the end is near e.g. killing themselves; one last sex; some drugs. What's amusing is that while filming, mostly from an apartment (and it's rooftop) in NY, that the vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the background scenes still looks normal right up to the end.

I wanted it to come up and grab my interest, but alas it did not.The story follow a couple (unsure if they're married) as they brave the last day on earth.I stopped watching about twenty minutes in, so my review is for the twenty minutes.The areas of the movie that needed an overhaul in order for it to be better, well it all comes down to the story.  The story was not all that great, and neither were the characters.  They weren't compelling at all.  I didn't care about them, and was therefore not interested in them.In the story telling business of movies, you have 10 minutes (or less...and it should be less) to grab your audience, hopefully by a really awesome or intriguing character/s.  This movie did not do that.I would also say that the directing wasn't all that interesting either.  They had a 5 min sex scene that I did not consider ""sexy"".  And to spend 5 min in the first 20 min, on a sex scene, there better be some pretty hot things going on, and be a reason for the sex (i.e. something important that relates back to the character/story). Also, 5 min is a long time. (side note: I'm curious if ""9 1/2 weeks"" spent that much time on their sex scenes.)Now, they did cast William Dafoe, who is an incredible actor.
