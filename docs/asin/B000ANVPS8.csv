They were all wannabes. Capon, the gangster comedian, is the real deal, and is very much underrated.He needs a serious agent so that he can go on the road and get paid what he deserves. He is a diamond hidden in the rough, with talent, good stories, charisma, and ""that thing"" that matures an ordinary comedian into a great one.I am still waiting for him to break away from the pack of wannabes. Shaq would do well to give this man the stage for a whole show, back him, and watch him take over the comedy scene. He is that good!

And While I am against re-releases and that the extras should have been on the original releases, I found disc 4 to make this set worth re-buying each movie Although it would have been great to have this 4th disc sold by it's self. It could have been called ""Latham Comedy Presents : The Extras"". The main reason why I didn't give this the full 5 stars is because they didn't sell the 4th disc by itself and inThe Queens of Comedy, Comedienne Adele Givens makes a joke towards the late Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes of TLC. I knowThe Queens of Comedywas filmed long before Left Eye died but it would have been nice to have that joke removed out of respect for the deceased.
