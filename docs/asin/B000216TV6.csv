For the past 5 or 6 years we have been searching for the availability of this movie. To my surprise we finally found a used copy (DVD)on Amazon offered by a used bookseller. I purchased it right away, it was in excellent condition. This movie is so charming, two young brothers who have lost their parents (the father in the Boer wars, and the mother by a fever)come to live with their Gruff Grandfather (played by Charelton Heston) who does a beautiful job in his character. The two young brothers, Harry and Davy will charm the socks off of you. In the beginning of the movie they are getting off a ship that brought them from Scotland to Canada to live with the grandparents. They are wearing their Scottish kilts. The grandfather has a prejudice against the Boers (Dutch) people in the community, which causes problems for him and Harry. There is a romance between Aunt Kirsty (the boys aunt)and the town doctor who happens to be a Boer. This does not sit well with the grandfather. The conversations between Harry and Davy will have you chuckling. Harry and Davy have a secret that they are keeping, which ends up finding Harry on trial. I wish that this movie would be more readily available through Amazon.",5,Charming Family Movie,1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,1279,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'Disney', 'Channel', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'past', '5', '6', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'searching', 'availability', 'movie', 'surprise', 'finally', 'found', 'used', 'copy', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'offered', 'used', 'bookseller', 'purchased', 'right', 'away', 'was', 'excellent', 'condition', 'movie', 'so', 'charming', 'two', 'young', 'brothers', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'parents', 'father', 'Boer', 'wars', 'mother', 'fever', 'come', 'live', 'Gruff', 'Grandfather', 'played', 'Charelton', 'Heston', 'who', 'beautiful', 'job', 'character', 'two', 'young', 'brothers', 'Harry', 'Davy', 'will', 'charm', 'socks', 'beginning', 'movie', 'are', 'getting', 'off', 'ship', 'brought', 'Scotland', 'Canada', 'live', 'grandparents', 'are', 'wearing', 'Scottish', 'kilts', 'grandfather', 'prejudice', 'Boers', 'Dutch', 'people', 'community', 'problems', 'Harry', 'romance', 'Aunt', 'Kirsty', 'boys', 'aunt', 'town', 'doctor', 'who', 'be', 'Boer', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'grandfather', 'conversations', 'Harry', 'Davy', 'will', 'have', 'chuckling', 'Harry', 'Davy', 'have', 'secret', 'are', 'keeping', 'up', 'finding', 'Harry', 'trial', 'wish', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'readily', 'available', 'Amazon']",N/A

Davis ""John Davis""","[0, 0]","A Canadian-American production (CBC-Disney), set in Nova Scotia in 1903, this film features two utterly charming lads (Harry, 8 and Davy, 6), at ease before the camera, and who steal the show from Charlton Heston, the titular star.The Boer War has been over a handful of years, Harry and Davy's father has been killed in the Boer War and their mother has died. They are sent by relatives in England to live with their Scots grandparents in Canada (Heston, Patricia Gage). Grandfather is deeply prejudiced against the Boer family who lives in the village, holding them responsible in the death of his son. A complicating factor is that Heston's daughter is in love with the Boer son. The effects of the prejudice on the immediate family and on the lads is the core of the story and leads to the incident suggested by the title.This is a re-working of the original 1953 story. I haven't seen that one, so cannot compare the two. But this one is an all-around family film -- no swearing, sexual references, or violence -- but it's not flat and lifeless.I rented it from Amazon Video On Demand for $1.99.",5,Excellent Family Film,1266796800,"02 22, 2010",2010,1100,"['Canadian-American', 'production', 'CBC-Disney', 'set', 'Nova', 'Scotia', '1903', 'film', 'two', 'utterly', 'charming', 'lads', 'Harry', '8', 'Davy', '6', 'ease', 'camera', 'who', 'steal', 'show', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'titular', 'star.The', 'Boer', 'War', 'been', 'handful', 'years', 'Harry', 'Davy', 'father', 'been', 'killed', 'Boer', 'War', 'mother', 'died', 'are', 'sent', 'relatives', 'England', 'live', 'Scots', 'grandparents', 'Canada', 'Heston', 'Patricia', 'Gage', 'Grandfather', 'deeply', 'prejudiced', 'Boer', 'family', 'who', 'village', 'holding', 'responsible', 'death', 'son', 'complicating', 'factor', 'Heston', 'daughter', 'love', 'Boer', 'son', 'effects', 'prejudice', 'immediate', 'family', 'lads', 'core', 'story', 'incident', 'suggested', 'title.This', 're-working', 'original', '1953', 'story', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'two', 'one', 'all-around', 'family', 'film', 'swearing', 'sexual', 'references', 'violence', 'not', 'flat', 'lifeless.I', 'rented', 'Amazon', 'Video', 'Demand', '1.99']",N/A
820795,A1N3AMX9ACTSNU,B000216TV6,"Marianna Steriadis ""Angeloudi""","[2, 2]","I have loved this movie ever since I saw it years ago on the Disney Channel.  It came out in 1990, so I thought my two young children (at that time ) would love it as well.  The film is set in 1903, in Nova Scotia, Canada, at a settlement inhabited by both Scottish and Dutch settlers.  James Mackenzie, the main character, is heavily prejudiced against his Dutch (Boer) neighbors, the Hooft family, due to the fact that his only son, Alec, was killed in the Boer War in South Africa.  Alec's wife also had died from some fever, and their two orphaned sons are travelling on their own to live with their ""granddaddy"".  The boys are the cutest tots you will ever encounter in any movie, dressed like little men in their kilts and name tags pinned to their shirts.  Harry, age 8, and Davy, aged 5 (or so) are at times sweet, mischievous, funny, endearing, rebellious, etc.  Little Davy wants so very much to have a dog, but his gruff grandfather, played by Charlton Heston, forbids it.  A frugal, bitter man full of hatred and unbreakable rules, he quickly alienates most of the settlers.  The movie is interesting, poignant, and heartwarming.  My only sadness is that my own children (including my now adult daughter), did not find this movie as moving as I did, but rather old-fashioned.",5,A charming family movie,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,1287,"['have', 'loved', 'movie', 'ever', 'saw', 'years', 'ago', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'came', 'out', '1990', 'thought', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'time', 'would', 'love', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'set', '1903', 'Nova', 'Scotia', 'Canada', 'settlement', 'inhabited', 'Scottish', 'Dutch', 'settlers', 'James', 'Mackenzie', 'main', 'character', 'heavily', 'prejudiced', 'Dutch', 'Boer', 'neighbors', 'Hooft', 'family', 'due', 'fact', 'only', 'son', 'Alec', 'was', 'killed', 'Boer', 'War', 'South', 'Africa', 'Alec', 'wife', 'also', 'had', 'died', 'fever', 'two', 'orphaned', 'sons', 'are', 'travelling', 'own', 'live', 'granddaddy', 'boys', 'are', 'cutest', 'tots', 'will', 'ever', 'encounter', 'movie', 'dressed', 'little', 'men', 'kilts', 'name', 'tags', 'pinned', 'shirts', 'Harry', 'age', '8', 'Davy', 'aged', '5', 'so', 'are', 'times', 'sweet', 'mischievous', 'funny', 'endearing', 'rebellious', 'etc', 'Little', 'Davy', 'so', 'very', 'much', 'have', 'dog', 'gruff', 'grandfather', 'played', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'frugal', 'bitter', 'man', 'full', 'hatred', 'unbreakable', 'rules', 'quickly', 'most', 'settlers', 'movie', 'interesting', 'poignant', 'heartwarming', 'only', 'sadness', 'own', 'children', 'including', 'now', 'adult', 'daughter', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'movie', 'as', 'moving', 'did', 'rather', 'old-fashioned']",N/A
