I could see non-NFL fans tuning in to this series based on it's dramatic strengths alone, maybe A&E; or Bravo, it would be a hit series.I've not followed the NFL seriously since I was a kid/teenager but this made me want to get back into it and I could see my mother watching this too, not just NFL crazed dad!It presents the time in-between Sundays and also does a marvelous job of gametime drama as well.

It used to be the standard. Then, I saw The Program. I still consider that the best football picture made, but Brian's Song was another story. Then, there was the book called Pros and Cons: The Criminals Who Play in the NFL (a second, as well as a third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, etc., part of the book is long overdue). Somewhere in the fog was the release of the horribly made Any Given Sunday. Finally, in 2003, ESPN did the unthinkable by green-lighting Playmakers what had all the right elements of an HBO produced show. The channel has the reputation for being one of the worst channels on television because it just cannot remain consistent and objective when it comes to sports. Just about nothing out of it is worth watching unless you like to hear repetitive biased yellow journalism constantly all day from fraudulent hacks. Anyway, the infamous show Playmakers ran for eleven episodes and then, under the pressure of NFL, was canceled and forever never shown again. What I found the show interesting was that I was able to identify many of the characters with players and coaches that play in NFL. And even more interesting, the show actually predicted a lot of things that eventually happened.Demetrius Harris = Michael Vick with a bit of Lawrence Taylor in himLeon Taylor = Tiki Barber (notice he has twins and cheated on his wife with the white reporter)Eric Olczyk = a Kyle Vanden Bosch look-alikeTony Denison = Mike Smith, coach of the Atlanta FalconsDerek McConnell = Brett Favre with Tony Romo's bug eyes or Ben RoethlisbergerPhil Chambers = Josh McDanielsBuffalo James = Leon LettGene Wilbanks = Jerry Jones but can be Arthur Blank (again with Michael Vick)Guard Dog Fredericks = Jeremy ShockeyThad Guerwitcz = Wes WelkerLatrell Hawkins = Robert Griffith IIISamantha Lovett = Rachel NicholsSlimy Reporters = ESPNPlaymakers was indeed gripping, provocative, and arresting to watch. But after maybe eight episodes, it had finally run out of steam because they've just covered just about everything as possible. Then, they started to recycle the stuff to fill in the rest of the next three episodes. I've got to credit Playmakers for making me to laugh so hard. I thought the show was one of the funniest ever because it kept piling on one drama after another as if it was a race to see what could be the most dramatic and then top that. In other words, Playmakers had become borderline ridiculous. Now, some have said that they started to care for the characters. Very funny...honestly, there was nobody at all to like. Finally, the ending...that was perfect. It reminded me of the 9-6 Vikings getting shut out of the division title and eventually the playoffs by the 3-12 Cardinals with seconds left in the last game of the 2003 season. No matter what was the record of the Cougars (what city was that from again?) team, I couldn't care less. All in all, Playmakers is a very funny but overly melodramatic show. Now, what's with these lame ""Happy Thanksgiving"" logo in the end? At least the Disney trademark was a nice touch; good sponsorship, uh uh.",5,Hilarious Stuff.

And while the show - in my opinion - took several weeks to really find some momentum, it turned out to be a very good dramatic series that addressed some serious societal & racial issues within the fictional pro football team, the Cougars, who played in The League.Topics such as spousal abuse, homosexuality, recreational drug usage and steroids made for compelling storylines. Though critics took aim at the scripts for oftentimes being over the top, the cast - that included Omar Gooding, Jason Matthew Smith and Marcello Thedford - made it work. The actors believed in the series, which made for some harsh words directed at ESPN when it cancelled the show after one season.The 11 episodes orignally ran from August 26 to November 11, 2003, with numerous replays. As the real storyline goes - proving again the fact is stranger than fiction - NFL executives weren't pleased with the series and basically told the ESPN brass that the fictional show goes off the air or the real football games will leave the network.When the series was cancelled, there were rumors that Playmakers would find another network to call home. That never got past the ""rumor"" stage.The storylines clearly demonstrate that Playmakers was building a strong foundation for a second season. But - in perhaps the best lesson of all - it showed how a multi-billion-dollar, multi-national corporation will become a program director to a compliant network and dictate what shows will air for any given season.",4,The Power Of The NFL & The Weakness Of ESPN,1168300800,"01 9, 2007",2007,1596,"['will', 'admit', 'was', 'very', 'sceptical', 'Playmakers', 'when', 'ESPN', 'made', 'initial', 'announcement', 'series', 'show', 'opinion', 'took', 'several', 'weeks', 'really', 'find', 'momentum', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'dramatic', 'series', 'addressed', 'serious', 'societal', 'racial', 'issues', 'fictional', 'pro', 'football', 'team', 'Cougars', 'who', 'played', 'League.Topics', 'such', 'spousal', 'abuse', 'homosexuality', 'recreational', 'drug', 'usage', 'steroids', 'made', 'compelling', 'storylines', 'critics', 'took', 'aim', 'scripts', 'oftentimes', 'being', 'top', 'cast', 'included', 'Omar', 'Gooding', 'Jason', 'Matthew', 'Smith', 'Marcello', 'Thedford', 'made', 'work', 'actors', 'believed', 'series', 'made', 'harsh', 'words', 'directed', 'ESPN', 'when', 'cancelled', 'show', 'one', 'season.The', '11', 'episodes', 'orignally', 'ran', 'August', '26', 'November', '11', '2003', 'numerous', 'replays', 'real', 'storyline', 'proving', 'again', 'fact', 'stranger', 'fiction', 'NFL', 'executives', 'were', ""n't"", 'pleased', 'series', 'basically', 'told', 'ESPN', 'brass', 'fictional', 'show', 'air', 'real', 'football', 'games', 'will', 'leave', 'network.When', 'series', 'was', 'cancelled', 'were', 'rumors', 'Playmakers', 'would', 'find', 'network', 'call', 'home', 'never', 'got', 'rumor', 'stage.The', 'storylines', 'clearly', 'demonstrate', 'Playmakers', 'was', 'building', 'strong', 'foundation', 'second', 'season', 'perhaps', 'best', 'lesson', 'showed', 'how', 'multi-billion-dollar', 'multi-national', 'corporation', 'will', 'become', 'program', 'director', 'compliant', 'network', 'dictate', 'what', 'will', 'air', 'given', 'season']",N/A

I enjoyed the fact that they're all fallible, that they have problems and insecurities away from the playing field.I also think it's interesting that some here have criticized the show for only showing the ""dark"" side of the game.  First, it likely wouldn't be a very entertaining show if it was all sunshine, with the team winning and every player acting the perfect citizen.  Secondly, I don't think it shows the ""dark"" side so much as the ""real"" side of pro sports.

Too short, but hella bangin'!!!This DVD set is brilliantly executed.  What a phenomenal series!Watching this set, I remember thinking, why was this on ESPN?  Why not on FX, or Spike?  Certainly most folks will think about putting it on a sports station, but I don't think this show should be ""pigeon-holed"" that way.  And after listening to the Writer commentary on the pilot, we get our answer.  It seems this series' pilot was completely written and ""sold"" to the FX network but for some reason was not picked up by them.  Too bad.  A lot of folks, who wouldn't normally turn to a sports station are going to miss out.  And for this reason, the show was short lived.If the FX execs had been smart, there would have been several seasons of this show, at least two or more.  I am so disappointed I did not watch this on ESPN and that it was cancelled, or at least not picked up for a new season!  I know this would have succeeded on the major Network channels.  What a shame!The storylines are quite interesting. While at times exaggerated, it is clear that many of the issues are pulled from the headlines, and even some of the actors, mention and compare the fictions character's problem to a real life professional athlete.  I suppose the viewer would have understand without this comparison, it is still interesting.I hope the writers are not discouraged by the close-mindedness of the FX ""green-lighters.""  I would like to see this show continue.  Not very likely, but still hopeful.I recommend you pick this one up, or at least rent it.  It's worth every penny!EDIT:  I just watched the last disc, and I have to say it again, this series was so good, but so short lived!  Its funny watching a show like this, that was obviously ""killed"" before its time.

It originally aired on ESPN from August to November in 2003, and this DVD set contains all eleven episodes of the show's lone season.During the Cougars' season, the team faced many common obstacles in their quest for a playoff berth, including conflict between players, coaches, and the owner.  ""Playmakers"" graphically displays the consequences, both physical and psychological, that playing pro football can exact.  The series examined issues such as steroid use, domestic violence, drug use, and unplanned pregnancies, and showed how a pro football team might have reacted if it found that it had a gay teammate.Some of the players had incidents from their pasts that they were still dealing with during the season.  The show also described the stress that a football career can place on marriages and families and between players and their old, pre-football friends and how tenuous careers in pro sports (and especially in pro football) can be.""Playmakers"" is above all a human story, showing how flawed men playing a tough game react differently to the situations that they face--some are basically good and struggle to do the right thing as they see it, some are amoral, and some are a mixture of both depending on the situation.

797384,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0001A79GM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","""Playmakers"" is another great underground television show.  It was produced for and aired on ESPN--a channel not really associated with fictional, scripted programming.  Their second dramatic effort, ""Tilt,"" set in the world of poker is also interesting but not quite as successful.  The problem with ""Playmakers"" which received notoriety and acclaim was that, ultimately, because it dealt with real concerns--it was not looked on favorably by the NFL.  So outside pressure and economic interests squashed any thought of a second season.That is unfortunate, because ""Playmakers"" is dynamic and entertaining television.  We've got issues dealing with recreational drugs, steroid use, spousal abuse, shootings, rape, homosexuality--all the hot button topics you can imagine.  On another network this show would have had breakout potential.  So, yes, there are plenty of soap opera shadings to keep the non-sports enthusiasts occupied--but this is also a fascinating study on the love of the game and the sacrifices made by it's players.  Whether you love or hate football, or are just indifferent, there is much to admire.The cast is grounded by Anthony John Denison, as the coach, dealing with some very serious issues of his own.  Omar Gooding is raw and magnetic as a powerful star on the rise.  His counterpoint is Russell Hornsby, a player on the decline.  His is one of the great overlooked performances of 2003.  But the entire cast here is solid, an ensemble that works together in a very believable way.If you are a fan of great, gritty TV--I'd equate the quality of this show to say ""The Shield"" in its prime seasons--do yourself a favor and check this out.

797385,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001A79GM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[13, 13]","""Playmakers,"" ESPN's pro football drama, lasted only a single season and only eleven episodes at that.  It became well known that the National Football League (read the Commissioner's office) hated the series because it provided an unrealistic (read realistic) picture of professional football.  As one columnist pointed out, ""Playmakers"" would have had trouble putting together a second season of shows simply because it had already used pretty much every real-world NFL scandal from the past decade.  But this week Baltimore Ravens running back Jamal Lewis was sentenced to four months in prison for using a cell phone to try and set up a drug deal, Terrell Owen has declared that he will be playing in the Super Bowl despite not being cleared to play by his doctor, and the Philadelphia Eagles signed veteran tight end Jeff Thomason to take a vacation from his construction job to play in the Super Bowl to replace the injured Chad Lewis on the roster.  So, yes, I think that ""Playmakers"" could have found more things to write about.For me the biggest adjustment with watching ""Playmakers"" was getting used to virtually all of the action being off the field.  We were more likely to see the Cougars involved in practice than on game day, and while we recognize that staging football scenes is time consuming (and involves elements of risk for the actors), it does require viewers to make some allowances of the stories.  This is because while most of the drama happens off the playing field the resolution of many of the issues can only take place during the game.  But by the time you get through the first couple of episodes you understand the rules by which the series is playing and it becomes clear ""Playmakers"" is character driven.The central character is #33 Leon Taylor (Russell Hornsby), a running back out of USC in his ninth season.  In addition to being old by running back standards, Taylor is just back rehabilitating an injury and dealing with whether or not the team is going to give him a contract for the next season.  Adding insult to injury is that the team is more than willing to give Taylor's starting position to rookie running back #39 Demetrius Harris (Omar Gooding).  This eternal conflict between the veteran and the rookie is at the heart of the series, and the biggest problem I have with Harris is not that he is always breaking the speed limit or doing drugs, but that he is portrayed as one of the most cocky and arrogant rookies in the history of football.  I kept waiting for middle linebacker #54 Eric Olczyk (Jason Matthew Smith) to just lay out the rookie flat during practice.  But the kid's behavior is indulged, even though it seems decidedly out of place on a team that is 2-3 when he pick up the season.While Taylor is doing steroids to get back from rehab, Olczyk is doing drugs of a different sort, anti-depressants, because the vicious hit he gave that paralyzed another player was actually a cheap shot.  The team's quarterback, #11 Derek McConnell (Christopher Wiehl) is rather boring in comparison, because he is just a swinging playboy.  The team's gopher and its gay defensive back are both much more interesting, as is offensive tackle #60 Kevin ""The Buffalo"" James (Marcello Thedford), who becomes DH's loyal sidekick, especially since we are talking about a loyalty that is abused.  Head Coach Mike George (Tony Denison) is also in his 9th season, with a winning record below .500, but it is his lack of control over his team rather than his win-loss record that suggests the Cougars get somebody new.Although ""Playmakers"" ends with the show's soap opera elements such as Olczyk's girl friend problems and Taylor's sportscaster try out threatening to overwhelm the ironic climax to the Cougar's season, you had to admit that ultimate the series WAS a soap opera.  What mattered was that the ESPN series fleshed out the stories ripped from the headlines about spousal abuse, players bulking up beyond what is good for them, drug detox, and quarterbacks who are really great runners.  Not only did we get the entire story, but also each story was told about much fuller characters than we get to know through watching the NFL (on ESPN or elsewhere).  I also liked the way the characters changed over the course of the season, forcing us to reassess them.  My initial sympathy for Taylor certainly waned, as did my feelings for most of the characters.  In the end, maybe what was so interesting about ""Playmakers"" was that the characters were three-dimensional, which is certainly more than you can say for the ""real"" playmakers in the NFL.",5,"Not only were the stories ""true,"" so were the characters",1106870400,"01 28, 2005",2005,4594,"['Playmakers', 'ESPN', 'pro', 'football', 'drama', 'lasted', 'only', 'single', 'season', 'only', 'eleven', 'became', 'well', 'known', 'National', 'Football', 'League', 'read', 'Commissioner', 'office', 'hated', 'series', 'provided', 'unrealistic', 'read', 'realistic', 'picture', 'professional', 'football', 'one', 'columnist', 'pointed', 'out', 'Playmakers', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'trouble', 'putting', 'together', 'second', 'season', 'shows', 'simply', 'had', 'already', 'used', 'pretty', 'much', 'real-world', 'NFL', 'scandal', 'past', 'decade', 'week', 'Baltimore', 'Ravens', 'running', 'back', 'Jamal', 'Lewis', 'was', 'sentenced', 'four', 'months', 'prison', 'using', 'cell', 'phone', 'try', 'set', 'up', 'drug', 'deal', 'Terrell', 'Owen', 'declared', 'will', 'be', 'playing', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'not', 'being', 'cleared', 'play', 'doctor', 'Philadelphia', 'Eagles', 'signed', 'veteran', 'tight', 'end', 'Jeff', 'Thomason', 'take', 'vacation', 'construction', 'job', 'play', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'replace', 'injured', 'Chad', 'Lewis', 'roster', 'So', 'yes', 'think', 'Playmakers', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'more', 'things', 'write', 'biggest', 'adjustment', 'watching', 'Playmakers', 'was', 'getting', 'used', 'virtually', 'action', 'being', 'off', 'field', 'were', 'more', 'likely', 'see', 'Cougars', 'involved', 'practice', 'game', 'day', 'recognize', 'staging', 'football', 'scenes', 'time', 'consuming', 'elements', 'risk', 'actors', 'require', 'viewers', 'make', 'allowances', 'stories', 'because', 'most', 'drama', 'playing', 'field', 'resolution', 'many', 'issues', 'can', 'only', 'take', 'place', 'game', 'time', 'get', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'understand', 'rules', 'series', 'playing', 'clear', 'Playmakers', 'character', 'driven.The', 'central', 'character', '33', 'Leon', 'Taylor', 'Russell', 'Hornsby', 'running', 'back', 'USC', 'ninth', 'season', 'addition', 'being', 'old', 'running', 'back', 'standards', 'Taylor', 'just', 'back', 'rehabilitating', 'injury', 'dealing', 'not', 'team', 'going', 'give', 'contract', 'next', 'season', 'Adding', 'insult', 'injury', 'team', 'more', 'willing', 'give', 'Taylor', 'starting', 'position', 'rookie', 'running', 'back', '39', 'Demetrius', 'Harris', 'Omar', 'Gooding', 'eternal', 'conflict', 'veteran', 'rookie', 'heart', 'series', 'biggest', 'problem', 'have', 'Harris', 'not', 'always', 'breaking', 'speed', 'limit', 'doing', 'drugs', 'portrayed', 'one', 'most', 'cocky', 'arrogant', 'rookies', 'history', 'football', 'kept', 'waiting', 'middle', 'linebacker', '54', 'Eric', 'Olczyk', 'Jason', 'Matthew', 'Smith', 'just', 'lay', 'out', 'rookie', 'flat', 'practice', 'kid', 'behavior', 'indulged', 'even', 'decidedly', 'place', 'team', '2-3', 'when', 'up', 'season.While', 'Taylor', 'doing', 'steroids', 'get', 'back', 'rehab', 'Olczyk', 'doing', 'drugs', 'different', 'sort', 'anti-depressants', 'vicious', 'hit', 'gave', 'paralyzed', 'player', 'was', 'actually', 'cheap', 'shot', 'team', 'quarterback', '11', 'Derek', 'McConnell', 'Christopher', 'Wiehl', 'rather', 'boring', 'comparison', 'just', 'swinging', 'playboy', 'team', 'gopher', 'gay', 'defensive', 'back', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'offensive', 'tackle', '60', 'Kevin', 'Buffalo', 'James', 'Marcello', 'Thedford', 'who', 'DH', 'loyal', 'sidekick', 'especially', 'are', 'talking', 'loyalty', 'abused', 'Head', 'Coach', 'Mike', 'George', 'Tony', 'Denison', 'also', '9th', 'season', 'winning', 'record', '.500', 'lack', 'control', 'team', 'rather', 'win-loss', 'record', 'Cougars', 'get', 'somebody', 'Playmakers', 'show', 'soap', 'opera', 'elements', 'such', 'Olczyk', 'girl', 'friend', 'problems', 'Taylor', 'sportscaster', 'try', 'out', 'threatening', 'overwhelm', 'ironic', 'climax', 'Cougar', 'season', 'had', 'admit', 'ultimate', 'series', 'WAS', 'soap', 'opera', 'What', 'mattered', 'was', 'ESPN', 'series', 'fleshed', 'stories', 'ripped', 'headlines', 'spousal', 'abuse', 'players', 'bulking', 'up', 'what', 'good', 'drug', 'detox', 'quarterbacks', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'runners', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'get', 'entire', 'story', 'also', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'about', 'much', 'fuller', 'characters', 'get', 'know', 'watching', 'NFL', 'ESPN', 'elsewhere', 'also', 'liked', 'way', 'characters', 'changed', 'course', 'season', 'forcing', 'reassess', 'initial', 'sympathy', 'Taylor', 'certainly', 'waned', 'did', 'feelings', 'most', 'characters', 'end', 'maybe', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'interesting', 'Playmakers', 'was', 'characters', 'were', 'three-dimensional', 'certainly', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'real', 'playmakers', 'NFL']",N/A

If I was surfing channels and landed on this show, even if it was an episode I saw several times before, I could not take my eyes off the screen.  Every episode is jam-packed with drama, intrigue, and amazing characters.  The series is about a fictional pro football team the Cougars and its wild season struggling to make the playoffs.  Every ugly, controversial stereotype is played for all it's worth. If you have not seen this series yet and want to be surprised, do not read on.  The following is a brief summary of some of the issues this series tackles:One player pushes his wife down a few stairs in a heated argument and, although he and his wife know it was an accident, word gets out and he is soon arrested for spousal battery.  Another player goes to all kinds of lengths (including proposing to a woman) to keep the fact that he is a homosexual from getting out to the public and his teammates.  One running back (played expertly by Omar Gooding) has an ego surpassing those of Terrell Owens, Keyshawn Johnson, and Jeremy Shockey all rolled into one.  He is also a drug addict who gets involved in a murder investigation (his brother is played by Snoop Dogg).  The owner of the team is given a Darth Vader persona, caring more about money and image than his players' lives.  Another player paralyzes an opponent with what he thinks might be a dirty hit.  He also has to contend with the memory of his father, a dictatorial high school football coach who worked his other son (and that player's brother) to death from heat stroke.  The quarterback has the equipment manager find women for him in the stands.  He's also had his share of abortion bills.  The coach is suffering from prostate cancer but cannot leave for fear he will lose his job to a hated rival.  Another player is coerced into keeping on the bulk even though his health is in jeopardy.  In one episode, the team's running back controversy is even discussed by Max Kellerman and the ""Around the Horn"" guys.  I think I remember Tony Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon from Pardon the Interruption in a clip as well. All this is just a taste of what this series goes into.  Every episode is amazing and the acting is superb.The extras include ""On the set with Snoop Dogg,"" a Behind-the-scenes featurette, and commentary on the pilot by executive producer John Eisendrath.  I'm not even that interested in the extras as the show itself is so good.  The NFL whined about Playmakers which played a big part in its cancellation after one smoldering season.  The topics obviously hit too close to home.  I do not know how they could have improved in a second season or what they would cover, as just about every controversial topic was jammed into the first season.  We will probably never know.",5,"""Nobody can touch me""--Demetrius Harris (RB, Cougars)",1087257600,"06 15, 2004",2004,2838,"['When', 'series', 'was', 'ESPN', 'last', 'football', 'season', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'was', 'surfing', 'channels', 'landed', 'show', 'even', 'was', 'episode', 'saw', 'several', 'times', 'could', 'not', 'take', 'eyes', 'screen', 'episode', 'jam-packed', 'drama', 'intrigue', 'amazing', 'characters', 'series', 'fictional', 'pro', 'football', 'team', 'Cougars', 'wild', 'season', 'struggling', 'make', 'playoffs', 'Every', 'ugly', 'controversial', 'stereotype', 'played', 'worth', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'series', 'yet', 'want', 'be', 'surprised', 'do', 'not', 'read', 'following', 'brief', 'summary', 'issues', 'series', 'One', 'player', 'wife', 'down', 'few', 'stairs', 'heated', 'argument', 'wife', 'know', 'was', 'accident', 'word', 'out', 'soon', 'arrested', 'spousal', 'battery', 'player', 'kinds', 'lengths', 'including', 'proposing', 'woman', 'keep', 'fact', 'homosexual', 'getting', 'out', 'public', 'teammates', 'One', 'running', 'back', 'played', 'expertly', 'Omar', 'Gooding', 'ego', 'surpassing', 'Terrell', 'Owens', 'Keyshawn', 'Johnson', 'Jeremy', 'Shockey', 'rolled', 'one', 'also', 'drug', 'addict', 'who', 'involved', 'murder', 'investigation', 'brother', 'played', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'owner', 'team', 'given', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'persona', 'caring', 'more', 'money', 'image', 'players', 'lives', 'player', 'opponent', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'dirty', 'hit', 'also', 'contend', 'memory', 'father', 'dictatorial', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'coach', 'who', 'worked', 'other', 'son', 'player', 'brother', 'death', 'heat', 'stroke', 'quarterback', 'equipment', 'manager', 'find', 'women', 'stands', 'also', 'had', 'share', 'abortion', 'bills', 'coach', 'suffering', 'prostate', 'cancer', 'can', 'not', 'leave', 'fear', 'will', 'lose', 'job', 'hated', 'rival', 'player', 'coerced', 'keeping', 'bulk', 'even', 'health', 'jeopardy', 'one', 'episode', 'team', 'running', 'back', 'controversy', 'even', 'discussed', 'Max', 'Kellerman', 'Horn', 'guys', 'think', 'remember', 'Tony', 'Kornheiser', 'Michael', 'Wilbon', 'Pardon', 'Interruption', 'clip', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'taste', 'what', 'series', 'episode', 'amazing', 'acting', 'superb.The', 'extras', 'include', 'set', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'Behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'commentary', 'pilot', 'executive', 'producer', 'John', 'Eisendrath', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'interested', 'extras', 'show', 'so', 'good', 'NFL', 'whined', 'Playmakers', 'played', 'big', 'part', 'cancellation', 'one', 'smoldering', 'season', 'topics', 'obviously', 'hit', 'too', 'close', 'home', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'improved', 'second', 'season', 'what', 'would', 'cover', 'just', 'controversial', 'topic', 'was', 'jammed', 'first', 'season', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'know']",N/A

Give ESPN credit for getting back to the E (Entertainment) in their name. Take away credit for apparently bowing to the overlords of the NFL and yanking this fine offering.Is this a realistic depiction of the day-to-day life of your average pro football player? Heck no! But as I said in the review title, Playmakers is first and foremost a soap opera. Just as a soap opera is an exaggeration of life, Playmakers is an exaggeration of football. No one team faces all the problems these Cougars endure. But, if you distilled all 32 pro teams into one, you'd find the drug addicted superstar, the lineman whose playing weight is putting him in real health danger, the closeted gay player, the gigolo QB, the multiple players with paternity suits, the aging star dealing with a spousal abuse charge, the coach struggling with cancer, the win-at-all-costs, as long as it looks good owner, etc., etc.Realistic, maybe not. Engaging? You bet. The performances are top notch, particularly Omar Gooding as DH, Jason Matthew Smith as Olczyk, and Russell Hornsby as Leon Taylor. You will come to care for these characters, cheer for this team, and feel their disappointments.If nothing else, this DVD's April release date will help fill the gap until training camp starts.Oh, the only reason I don't give this show five stars is that occasionally the budget constraints show through. It'd be nice to see the Cougars play some games on natural grass, and we don't always get the feeling that they're playing in front of 50,000+ people. This is really a minor nit-pick, as the character segments are riveting.Looking forward to seeing what the DVD has to offer.4-and-a-half stars, really.",4,"An engaging, testosterone-fueled, soap opera.",1075334400,"01 29, 2004",2004,1826,"['review', 'based', 'original', 'broadcast', 'series', 'My', 'wife', 'are', 'football', 'fans', 'Go', 'Pats', 'became', 'instantly', 'hooked', 'ESPN', 'Playmakers', 'Give', 'ESPN', 'credit', 'getting', 'back', 'E', 'Entertainment', 'name', 'Take', 'away', 'credit', 'apparently', 'bowing', 'overlords', 'NFL', 'yanking', 'fine', 'offering.Is', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'average', 'pro', 'football', 'player', 'Heck', 'said', 'review', 'title', 'Playmakers', 'first', 'foremost', 'soap', 'opera', 'Just', 'soap', 'opera', 'exaggeration', 'life', 'Playmakers', 'exaggeration', 'football', 'one', 'team', 'problems', 'Cougars', 'endure', 'distilled', '32', 'pro', 'teams', 'one', ""'d"", 'find', 'drug', 'addicted', 'superstar', 'lineman', 'playing', 'weight', 'putting', 'real', 'health', 'danger', 'closeted', 'gay', 'player', 'gigolo', 'QB', 'multiple', 'players', 'paternity', 'suits', 'aging', 'star', 'dealing', 'spousal', 'charge', 'coach', 'struggling', 'cancer', 'win-at-all-costs', 'as', 'long', 'good', 'owner', 'etc.', 'etc.Realistic', 'maybe', 'not', 'Engaging', 'bet', 'performances', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'particularly', 'Omar', 'Gooding', 'DH', 'Jason', 'Matthew', 'Smith', 'Olczyk', 'Russell', 'Hornsby', 'Leon', 'Taylor', 'will', 'come', 'care', 'characters', 'cheer', 'team', 'feel', 'disappointments.If', 'nothing', 'else', 'DVD', 'April', 'release', 'date', 'will', 'help', 'fill', 'gap', 'training', 'camp', 'starts.Oh', 'only', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'show', 'five', 'stars', 'occasionally', 'budget', 'constraints', 'show', ""'d"", 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'Cougars', 'play', 'games', 'natural', 'grass', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'get', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'playing', 'front', '50,000+', 'people', 'really', 'minor', 'nit-pick', 'character', 'segments', 'are', 'riveting.Looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'what', 'DVD', 'offer.4-and-a-half', 'stars', 'really']",N/A
