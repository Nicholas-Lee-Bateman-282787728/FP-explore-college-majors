Many times it appears they are making up their lines as they go, but they can't come up with anything funny.There are some funny scenes in the movie, not hilarious, because the scenes are not pushed far enough to make it hilarious.example: The dance battle between the two main characters was poorly choreographed, too slow, and not silly enough to make it funny.example:  Laser room scene, again not pushed far enough to make it really funny.example: lady in bakery coming on to the main characterBasically that's the problem with the movie, it's just not pushed far enough to make it truly hilarious.

1197925,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001GMAVGE,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I remember when I was a kid watching reruns of `Get Smart' all the time.  It was seriously one of my favorite shows.  Granted, I haven't seen the show in years, but the memories I have are still very fond, and so when this little remake was released I was all sorts of excited.It was worth getting excited over.Steve Carell steps into the telephone/shoes of Maxwell Smart, an agent for CONTROL who is just waiting for his chance to work in the field.  When their secret facility is destroyed by members of KAOS Smart is sent into the field alongside the beautiful Agent 99 in order to stop this evil organization.  Agent 99 is rather reluctant, since this would be Smart's first mission and he is a bit of a klutz, but she has no choice.What follows, is awesome.I can't even count how many times I laughed throughout this hilarious romp, for just about every joke lands and just about every thrill actually thrills.  Carell is just superb as Smart, giving him this charming quality that I didn't think he could pull off.  I am not the biggest fan of Carell's, but my friends love him.  I just never got his humor.  This changed my mind about him.  Dwayne `The Rock' Johnson is actually really funny here.  I've been impressed with his acting since first seeing him in `The Rundown'.  Sure, he hasn't chosen remarkable films to make, but he is a far better actor than a lot of those `rapper turned actors' we have floating around almost every movie.  Alan Arkin is memorable as the Chief.  His quick wit and sharp delivery elevate his scenes.The film belongs to Anne Hathaway though.  She is funny and charming and seductive and luminous as Agent 99.This girl is just having the best year ever, seriously.  A few years ago she was taking a backseat to everyone she filmed with, and now she is outshining her co-stars and raking up some impressive awards (for her performance in `Rachel Getting Married', a film I am so anxious to see).  I have been a fan of hers since `The Princess Diaries' (yes, I saw that) and thought she was stellar in both her Oscar contending films (`Brokeback Mountain' and `The Devil Wears Prada') so I am thrilled to finally see her getting the honorable mentions instead of everyone around her.`Get Smart' is very funny and very entertaining.  My one complaint is that it does feel about twenty minutes too long.  The ending could have been trimmed a tad (this is a family comedy, not a baity drama...short and sweet is the name of the game) but that isn't to say that the last twenty minutes isn't enjoyable.  It is still funny and action packed, and it adds to the story (twists, oh there have to be twists) but it does feel as though it is dragging a bit.That is my only complaint though, and the film still gets a very excitable B+, maybe even an A-.  It is fun for everyone and a film I wholeheartedly recommend.",4,This film adaptation is quite smart...,1229040000,"12 12, 2008",2008,2844,"['remember', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'watching', 'reruns', 'Get', 'Smart', 'time', 'was', 'seriously', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'Granted', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'years', 'memories', 'have', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'fond', 'so', 'when', 'little', 'remake', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'sorts', 'excited.It', 'was', 'worth', 'getting', 'excited', 'over.Steve', 'Carell', 'telephone/shoes', 'Maxwell', 'Smart', 'agent', 'CONTROL', 'who', 'just', 'waiting', 'chance', 'work', 'field', 'When', 'secret', 'facility', 'destroyed', 'members', 'KAOS', 'Smart', 'sent', 'field', 'beautiful', 'Agent', '99', 'order', 'stop', 'evil', 'organization', 'Agent', '99', 'rather', 'reluctant', 'would', 'be', 'Smart', 'first', 'mission', 'bit', 'klutz', 'choice.What', 'awesome.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'count', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'laughed', 'hilarious', 'romp', 'just', 'joke', 'just', 'thrill', 'actually', 'Carell', 'just', 'superb', 'Smart', 'giving', 'charming', 'quality', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'am', 'not', 'biggest', 'fan', 'Carell', 'friends', 'love', 'just', 'never', 'got', 'humor', 'changed', 'mind', 'Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'actually', 'really', 'funny', 'here', ""'ve"", 'been', 'impressed', 'acting', 'first', 'seeing', 'Rundown', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'chosen', 'remarkable', 'films', 'make', 'far', 'better', 'actor', 'lot', 'rapper', 'turned', 'actors', 'have', 'floating', 'around', 'almost', 'movie', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'memorable', 'Chief', 'quick', 'wit', 'sharp', 'delivery', 'elevate', 'scenes.The', 'film', 'belongs', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'funny', 'charming', 'seductive', 'luminous', 'Agent', '99.This', 'girl', 'just', 'having', 'best', 'year', 'ever', 'seriously', 'A', 'few', 'years', 'was', 'taking', 'backseat', 'everyone', 'filmed', 'now', 'outshining', 'co-stars', 'raking', 'up', 'impressive', 'awards', 'performance', 'Rachel', 'Getting', 'Married', 'film', 'am', 'so', 'anxious', 'see', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'hers', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'yes', 'saw', 'thought', 'was', 'stellar', 'Oscar', 'contending', 'films', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'am', 'thrilled', 'finally', 'see', 'getting', 'honorable', 'mentions', 'instead', 'everyone', 'her.', 'Get', 'Smart', 'very', 'funny', 'very', 'entertaining', 'one', 'complaint', 'feel', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', 'tad', 'family', 'comedy', 'not', 'baity', 'drama', 'short', 'sweet', 'name', 'game', ""n't"", 'say', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'enjoyable', 'still', 'funny', 'action', 'packed', 'story', 'twists', 'oh', 'there', 'have', 'be', 'twists', 'feel', 'dragging', 'bit.That', 'only', 'complaint', 'film', 'still', 'very', 'excitable', 'B+', 'maybe', 'even', 'A-', 'fun', 'everyone', 'film', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend']",Get Smart

Only 99's identity is not compromised and the Chief promotes Max to Agent 86 so that they can stop Chaos from blowing up the President.The fun starts from there.

Now KAOS is threatening to Nuke a few cities if they do not get their extortion money. Who is behind the dastardly plot? Of course, it is the last person you would suspect.

If you like Mel Brooks style slapstick, that's exactly what it is.These folks took a page from the Mission:Impossible crew on how to translate an old TV show to a decent movie:1. Have a decent budget for a good script and good effects.2. Hire some A-list actors.3. Respect the things that made the original special.4. If the theme song is a recognizable, well-composed classic, keep it.I'm not really a fan of Steve Carell, but he's pitch-perfect as Maxwell Smart. His deadpan delivery is spot on.I am fans of Anne Hathaway and Alan Arkin, and they both turn in good efforts. I've like Anne since The Princess Diaries, and Alan since he captured the enigmatic Yossarian in Catch 22 (forty years ago!).Ex-athlete actors can be a risk for pushing the cheesiness factor too far, but Dwayne Johnson does reasonably well here. His entrance is quite funny, and even though his character is supposed to be a prima donna type, he never hogs the spotlight.Terrence Stamp is an underappreciated talent - the Christopher Lee of his generation, as far as I'm concerned. He's the ideal choice for the super-villian Siegfried, and has the line in the movie that made me laugh hardest:Siegfried's assistant: Too bad about all the dead movie stars.Siegfried: Yes. What will we do without their razor-sharp political advice.The original series was created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, and they were brought in as consultants on this effort. I think this helped get the right feel for the characters, not to mention the running jokes from the original series (""Would you believe..."", ""Sorry about that, Chief."", ""Missed it by that much."", Etc.), which are not overdone and generally integrated nicely into the dialog without being too forced.There are some flaws. A few scenes do go on too long. The ""get past the criss-crossing lasers"" scene and the chase scenes at the end are the best examples.Seriously, this isn't a top-ten all time comedy.

Those laughs are probably the biggest if you spot them.What can you say about Steve Carell? In remakes of this type it is easy for the movie actor to come up short of the legend created out of the popular TV role. (Will Smith as James West anyone?) As much as I enjoyed Don Adams in the TV series, Steve Carell one up's him and is a better Maxwell Smart than Adams was.Anne Hathaway obviously studied Barbara Feldon's Agent 99 quite a bit, because there are lines in the movie where you could swear that a younger Feldon had been plugged in. She's spot on in the role.The movie pays homage to Don Adam's most famous repeat bits without overdoing it one bit. The story is engaging, and the action is very well done, although you'll struggle to recognize that because they don't let up on the comedy accelerator even in the middle of action scenes that would be the most tense in any other film.The Blu-ray redition of the film is a delight to watch. I don't go through special features often, so I won't comment on those, altho we did watch the outtake/gag reel and it was worth the time spent to watch it ... twice.We have now watched this film several times as we played it for ourselves, and then various sets of family and friends.

To be honest, I wasn't a big fan of the show growing up even though I watched it (there wasn't a lot to choice from back then). With that in mind I wondered if I really wanted to listen to all the rehashed lines and view all the 60's comedy routines that the 60's television series was known for. However I do enjoy Steve Carell and Dwayne ""the Rock""  Johnson so I decided to go ahead and spend the quality time with my wife and daughter and take the chance.I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised with what I saw. While the film remained true to the spirit of the original series there was more than enough original thinking infused into the movie to allow the film to be enjoyed on its own merit without being nothing more than a tribute piece of cinema. There were loads of laughs, some superior physical comedy sequences (love the dance-off), smart dialogue (yes, I said smart) and consistent energy from beginning to end.

1197946,A1GB0HW46Y2EB,B001GMAVGE,Bruce G. Taylor,"[3, 8]","Watching the film, ""Get Smart"" (2008) reminded me of two earlier big budget comedy films, ""It's a Mad, Mad etc. World"" (1963) directed by Stanley Kramer and ""1941"" (1979) directed by Steven Spielberg.  Both movies had large casts of talented performers, had a ton of money thrown at them and, for the most part simply laid there failing to fulfill their primary goals: to make audiences laugh.  Neither director had had very much experience in the comedy field, a serious handicap, which brings me immediately to Woody Allen, the most talented writer of comedy over the past fifty years, who, initially at least, had no experience in directing a motion picture.  The least of his films --  of those that he both wrote and directed -- leave both of the above films in the dust being successful and often brilliant achievements in screen comedy.  Steven Spielberg recalled the preview of ""1941"" at a local theater in Los Angeles.  ""We stood in the lobby and the audience became quieter and quieter.  I went in and looked and several people had their hands over their ears.  I knew we were in trouble.""  Today, the most successful comedy films, i.e. films that are actually funny, are those written and directed by the Coen brothers.I didn't watch many of the television episodes of ""Get Smart"" as I had largely given up watching commercial television programs by that time, but I had seen Don Adams perform many times and he was an undoubted expert as a standup comedian, having funny material and flawless comedic timing, without which, the program ""Get Smart"" would never have been the success that it was.  Mel Brooks, Buck Henry, Don Adams and many others shared writing credit for the series.Steve Carell who plays the lead in the film ""Get Smart"" does not impress me as a professional comedian.  I'm not certain what he is, but the one thing that he is not is funny.  Likewise the director, Peter Segal, shows little of the comedic abilities of Woody Allen or the Coen brothers with the result that nearly all of the attempts at screen comedy misfire here.  The director apparently decided to substitute fancy special effects in lieu of competant comedy writing.  The mistakes that are made in the film are numerous:  One example is Carell talking amorously to someone off camera, whom we are initially led to believe, must be an attractive woman.  But the shot of Carell talking runs too long without a cut which prematurely tells us that he is not talking to a woman.  When the cut finally does occur it turns out to be a cute little dog which does not play funny because the joke has already been sprung ahead of time.  In the trade this is known as telegraphing your punch line.  This is the fault of both the director and editor and the film is generally clumsy in this regard.  The scene in the airplane restroom with the darts misfiring is mildly funny the first time, but it goes on and on and simply becomes painful to watch.  The ""comic"" dance number with the overweight girl is both cruel and crude.  The joke about the poison capsule lays an egg due to inept writing.  In the hands of Woody Allen, this would have been written to be funny.As the film goes on (and it does go on -- and on!) it becomes less of a comedy (if that were possible) and more of a high-tech actioner indicating that apparently no one involved had a clear idea of what the film was actually intended to be, the final 20 minutes essentially being an incoherent mess of special effects and chases.For those of us old enough to remember the ""Fibber McGee & Molly"" radio show: when Fibber McGee would spring a joke that got groans instead of a laugh, Molly would say,  ""T'ain't funny, McGee.""

The government agency he works for known only as CONTROL are infiltrated by an evil agency known as KAOS which compromises the identities of all the current field agents. So in order to battle this force and still stay a secret, the chief of CONTROL puts smart on the field and assigns him the title of agent 86 partnering him with the much more experienced Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway). Max looks up to his close friend and one of the best agents on the field, Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson). He is the James Bond of CONTROL and it's no surprise that Max wants to be so much like him.This is just a really light hearted and fast paced film. I guess it could just be labelled a comedy, but that would just ignore the other great aspects of the film. The action is done really well and isn't the tacky type comedy we have come to associate comedy movies when they feature action. Some of the sequences are genuinely unique and truly edge of your seat. The chemistry between Hathaway and Carell is great and one scene in particular expresses the comedic chemistry between the two. The laser room scene which is somewhat of a clich&eacute; for spy movies is superb in this.Carell is the usual silly guy we have come to know and love, his ridiculous expressions and perfected comic timing are all present. It's also very pleasant to see the wonderful Anne Hathaway in a leading role where she isn't the damzel in distress, or the naive teenager. The Bill Murray cameo is also something quite special as agent 13, he's only there for a moment and has about three lines but it's always great to see Bill Murray on our screens. It also seems quite a wrestler fest as well, obviously with the inclusion of Dwayne Johnson as agent 23 but also WWEs The Great Khali as the clich&eacute; middle eastern, giant bad guy. Johnson doesn't take his character too seriously, which is something he always manages to shine in playing but manages to pull out the acting stops when he has to enter into the action man role.An awesome movie all round and is definitely worth it just for the sky diving scene and the laser room.",5,"Really Great, Not What I Expected At All",1224892800,"10 25, 2008",2008,2741,"['watched', 'film', 'read', 'reviews', 'press', 'most', 'were', ""n't"", 'great', 'am', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'guys', 'who', 'will', 'put', 'off', 'watching', 'bad', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'gutted', 'did', 'film', 'was', 'simply', 'personification', 'brilliance', 'start', 'finish', 'slick', 'stylish', 'downright', 'comic', 'excellence', 'Even', 'film', 'special', 'effect', 'general', 'action', 'would', 'put', 'even', 'James', 'Bond', 'shame', 'exciting', 'quite', 'emotional', 'times', 'cool', 'others', 'just', 'downright', 'silly', 'times', 'are', 'left.Steve', 'Carell', 'Maxwell', 'Smart', 'secret', 'agent', 'who', 'desperately', 'get', 'field', 'government', 'agency', 'known', 'only', 'CONTROL', 'are', 'infiltrated', 'evil', 'agency', 'known', 'KAOS', 'identities', 'current', 'field', 'agents', 'So', 'order', 'battle', 'force', 'still', 'stay', 'secret', 'chief', 'CONTROL', 'smart', 'field', 'title', 'agent', '86', 'partnering', 'much', 'more', 'experienced', 'Agent', '99', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Max', 'up', 'close', 'friend', 'one', 'best', 'agents', 'field', 'Agent', '23', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'James', 'Bond', 'CONTROL', 'surprise', 'Max', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'him.This', 'just', 'really', 'light', 'hearted', 'fast', 'paced', 'film', 'guess', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'labelled', 'comedy', 'would', 'just', 'ignore', 'other', 'great', 'aspects', 'film', 'action', 'done', 'really', 'well', ""n't"", 'tacky', 'type', 'comedy', 'have', 'come', 'associate', 'comedy', 'movies', 'when', 'feature', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'genuinely', 'unique', 'truly', 'edge', 'seat', 'chemistry', 'Hathaway', 'Carell', 'great', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'expresses', 'comedic', 'chemistry', 'two', 'laser', 'room', 'scene', 'somewhat', 'clich', 'eacute', 'spy', 'movies', 'superb', 'this.Carell', 'usual', 'silly', 'guy', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'love', 'ridiculous', 'expressions', 'perfected', 'comic', 'timing', 'are', 'present', 'also', 'very', 'pleasant', 'see', 'wonderful', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'leading', 'role', 'where', ""n't"", 'damzel', 'distress', 'naive', 'teenager', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'cameo', 'also', 'something', 'quite', 'special', 'agent', '13', 'only', 'there', 'moment', 'about', 'three', 'lines', 'always', 'great', 'see', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'screens', 'also', 'quite', 'wrestler', 'fest', 'as', 'well', 'obviously', 'inclusion', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'agent', '23', 'also', 'WWEs', 'Great', 'Khali', 'clich', 'eacute', 'middle', 'eastern', 'giant', 'bad', 'guy', 'Johnson', ""n't"", 'take', 'character', 'too', 'seriously', 'something', 'always', 'shine', 'playing', 'manages', 'pull', 'out', 'acting', 'stops', 'when', 'enter', 'action', 'man', 'awesome', 'movie', 'round', 'definitely', 'worth', 'just', 'sky', 'diving', 'scene', 'laser', 'room']",Get Smart

Carell as Agent 86 and Anne Hathaway as Agent 99 team up to stop K.A.O.S. from unleashing a nuclear bomb. Maxwell Smart has been a reliable office agent for some time and even when he passes his field agent test the Chief, played by Alan Arkan, does not want him to go to the field because of his expertise with tracking people while at C.O.N.T.R.O.L. headquarters.

Carrell is a brilliant comedic actor but he played Smart so straight he had almost no personality. Barbara Feldon's 99 was smart and confident but also vulnerable.

1197958,A3628L43ZVEMP5,B001GMAVGE,Christopher Twelvetrees,"[2, 4]","Based on the 1960s television series, ""Get Smart"" is about a totally ineffective secret operative of the government.The good:  I have never seen ""The Office"" so Steve Carell was a totally unknown quantity to me.  He had a big shadow overhanging him in the form of Don Adams' Maxwell Smart (from the original show).  Unfair as it is to compare the two, ""Get Smart"" is not like a Shakespeare play where anyone can put a different stamp on Hamlet.  The ghost of Adams' Maxwell Smart must have been difficult to exorcise.  Fortunately, Carell is good enough to bring a whole new take on the character and make it his own.  He is not doing a cheap Don Adams' impersonation.  And his Smart is quite effective, in his own way.Anne Hathaway is a good 99, a bit more competent than she was in the original series (where everyone in CONTROL was wacky).  She was given a secret back story she can reveal in order to give her a scene where she really has to act and evoke sympathy.  The moment ""Get Smart"" fans were waiting for, her first ""Oh, Max!"" was nicely timed in the pacing of the movie and was delivered flawlessly.  I liked her 99 better than Barbara Feldon (whose acting in the series was always more on the glamor side).The movie is littered with funny comedy moments and comedic turns, one of them the cameo of the original Siegfried, Bernie Kopell.  The way ""Get Smart"" does its opening and closing with the secret doors allowed it to be familiar and, using special effects, at the same time good way to introduce the viewer into the modern day's CONTROL.  THEY EVEN HAD A PHONE BOOTH.  It must be the last in captivity.  They probably should have updated that idea.Unfortunately, scattered moments, however good they are, do not add up to an entertaining movie.  Since the human body can laugh only so long, every comedy movie must have its more serious moments.  In the silent days, great comedians like Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd sprinkled the laughs in up front while building to comedic climaxes.  ""Get Smart"" follows the pattern of many modern comedy movies that plant their flags early on by front-loading lots of laughs, then going into action/suspense mode near the end.The laughs in ""Get Smart"" do not come evenly.  A movie like ""Airplane"" threw a lot at the audience.  If the audience didn't laugh at one thing, the next thing was already heading for them.  ""Get Smart"" frankly doesn't throw that much.  A lot of the movie, such as Smart's dance routine with an overweight lady, is simply a wasted time.  There's a lot of wasted celluloid in this movie.Alan Arkin does not work as the Chief.  Arkin can be extremely funny -- watch ""The In-Laws"" -- but the point of the Chief in the tv series was that he got laughs by being extremely serious.  More than a decade before the makers of ""Airplane"" cast Lloyd Bridges, Robert Stack, Peter Graves and Leslie Nielsen in a comedy where they were hilarious by being their deadpan selves, ""Get Smart"" cast the po-faced Edward Platt, who got laughs by being ultra-serious.  Alan Arkin is a good actor with a solid credentials.  But at some point in his career he, like Gene Wilder, decided to go into high gear and stay there.  If you want to see a perfectly subtle and nuanced performance by Arkin, go back to the climax of ""The Russians are Coming!  The Russians are Coming!""  He plays the Chief more like a middle-aged Yossarian.  Perhaps they should have cast Terence Stamp as the Chief, giving the same effective performance he gives here as the bad guy.Terence Stamp's performance really is too good for this movie.  Like all villains in the movies these days, he is white with an English accent.  English actors make the best villains because they are often classically trained, and they take whatever they do seriously (I can't imagine an American actor in ""Star Wars"" playing Obi-Wan or Grand Moff Tarkin without a twinkle in his eye that says, ""We both know this is rubbish but I need the money.""  Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing tackled their hero/baddie roles with the same aplomb they'd have brought to Shakespeare;  or, with Peter Cushing, driving a stake through a vampire).  Of course, one wonders why a guy named Siegfried has an English accent.  In the tv series, Siegfried was just as incompetent as Max in his own way, and he spoke with an outrageous pseudo-German accent.Stamp could give this same performance as a white, English-accented terrorist in a serious action flick against Stallone, Willis, Will Smith, &c.;  Perhaps they felt they needed a bona fide threat to make ""Get Smart"" watchable, when more laughs would have done the trick.  But more laughs would have meant more work all around.So they cut a movie to the run-of-the-mill action flick pattern and grafted Agents 86 and 99 onto it.  They peppered it with a few laughs, ran their few really good and original ideas up a flagpole, let it simmer according to the recipe, and then served it up luke-warm. Despite solid performances by Carell and Hathaway, that's what ""Get Smart"" amounts to.I saw this movie for the first time just weeks following a genuine foreign relations debacle, where a real president, in a series of circumstances leading to a genuine attack by terrorists on several foreign embassies and the murder of an American ambassador in Libya, brushed off half or more of his intelligence briefings (probably to hit the golf courses) and spiked the football about having sent an assassination squad after an actual terrorist. So while watching ""Get Smart"" I was reminded that the world still is a treacherous place;  and when ****-ups like Obama can grease their way into the White House, that fish rots from its head and intelligence services do become buffoons.It's good that Americans can still laugh in the face of horror.  But ""Get Smart"" wastes too much time.  I applaud its attempt not to slavishly copy an old tv show we've seen before, the way Blake Edward kept trying to keep the Pink Panther alive (ending up with movies just as dead as Peter Sellers).Rather than pretending this movie was ""Get Smart"" they might just as well have titled it something else, given 86 and 99 different appellations, called the Chief and CONTROL and Siegfried by different names, and had just as valid a show.  And it might have been better.Still, there is Hathaway's ""Oh, Max!""",2,"Get Smart Gets Some Right, Gets Some Wrong",1349222400,"10 3, 2012",2012,6326,"['Based', '1960s', 'television', 'series',

In brining a 40 year old TV show to the big screen, the powers that be brought Agents 86 and 99 into the modern era and gave them more detailed treatment.  Steve Carell brings back the kind of playing it straight humor that Don Adams did so well.  Maxwell Smart is a terrific analyst who has worked like crazy to become a field agent, but has been kept from it for a variety of reasons, not the least is his superb ability as an analyst.  Ann Hatheway is a modern woman and is more disinterested in 86 than Barbara Feldon's version ever was.  Terrence Stamp is a positively diabolical Siegfried and the humor associated with him happens around him (mostly).  Bernie Kopell's Siegfried was written with a touch of villainy and a lot more humor.  However, putting together a feature film requires more substance for a story than a half-hour sitcom.  (Kopell does make a cameo appearance so watch for him!).The plot of the story matters little except for the jokes it helps to set up.  That was the point of the TV show, too.  Alan Arkin is quite good as Chief and the rest of the cast does their work with a nice touch.  Dwayne Johnson pulls of the ultimate Agent 23 deftly.  I also enjoyed Masi Oka and Nate Torrence as Bruce and Lloyd.  Their line about getting the super strong thread by milking spiders is unforgettable.  Bill Murray has a nice cameo as Agent 13 that is a wonderful homage to the original show.You can also watch the movie in ""comedy enhancement mode"" were the alternate lines not used in the film are provided.  Some are funny, many are not.  I saw why most were not in the movie although I enjoyed the lines about the viola.Anyway, cotton candy is fun to eat in the way this movie is fun to watch.  Maybe we can get another one with more of Bruce and Lloyd and Hymie (Patrick Warburton).

Nobody can top what Adams, Feldon, Platt, Kopell, etc. did in the series and the actors in this don't rip off their interpretations or belittle what they had done. Carell plays Max with a deadpan wit, which I enjoy, compared to Adams' nasily voice which defined the character back in the 60s and it still does now. Hathaway is the accomplished agent who doesn't even tolerate Max until the end while Feldon immediately fell in love with him. Platt's Chief grew exasperated with Max's antics while Arkin's actually admired Max's talent. And Kopell (who makes a cameo) used a thick German accent while Terence Stamp is an English actor who plays Seigfreid with a bit more menace. The references to the series are excellent from Max's catchphrase to the shoe-phone. Even the three cars Adams drove in the opening credits are featured. The plot is a little cliched (drawing comparisons from how Steve Martin's Clouseau gets humiliated only to be redeemed in the end) and some twists aren't that surprising but it doesn't stop this from being funny and exciting. The gags and jokes are clever (this being one of few comedies I've seen in theatres and the whole audience was laughing) but the vomit joke was disgusting and not remotely funny. The action sequences were executed well, some scenes being homages to the Bond films (the original series being a spoof of them) such as the free fall fight sequence with Dalip (who reminds me a little of Richard Keil's Jaws and Kabir Bedi's Gobinda) from Moonraker.

Steve Carrell was the perfect choice to step in for Don Adams as Maxwell Smart. I liked his rendition of the character from the beginning of the movie. I was frustrated at first by Ann Hathaway's portrayal of Donna Feldman's Agent 99 because she wasn't the sweet, seemingly innocent girl who was so impressed with Max that Donna Feldman had been. However, she grew on me as the movie progressed and all things come full circle in this regard as Max ultimately wins her in the end. There is more action and special effects in this movie than I expected which was also fun. The movie is often humorously amusing and several times it is outright hilarious.

1197982,A2BQBLCKJHP65G,B001GMAVGE,"Eric Ericson ""RedSabbath""","[4, 7]","Being a TV obsessed kid in the mid 70's, my afternoons were usually filled with syndicated shows of the decade before. One of those shows that caught my eye was Get Smart. Started in 1965, this was a spy comedy as USA's answer to James Bond but with a comedic flair. Don Adams played Maxwell ""Agent 86"" Smart, a bumbling yet charismatic spy working for the secret organization Control in the fight against Kaos, the Russian Cold War equivalent. Surrounded by a cast of equally interesting characters including his younger, more competent female partner Agent 99 and his always frustrated in Max's foolishness boss The Chief. Get Smart was a mix of old-school spy tricks and gadgets with good word-play humor.Now flashing forward over forty-five years later, the Hollywood remake machine once again dips into it's pockets and pulls out yet another classic for, to put it kindly, modernization. But with today's technology in special effects, can a new team of actors bring back these spies to a world where the Cold War is a forgotten memory?Just looking at the new cast, you can tell that visually director Peter ""50 First Dates"" Segal wanted to preserve and respect the original cast in that aspect, and does so very well. Just looking at Steve Carell's resemblance to Don Adams is uncanny, and with Anne Hathaway (who's career is a bit too big now for a role like this) as Agent 99 and Alan Arkin as The Chief, you'd be hard-pressed to think of any other actor in these roles today. But one thing noticable to fans of the old series to this film will be that even though they look like the originals, acting-wise they're nowhere near close. Carell's Smart is downright dead-panned completely ignoring the standards set by Adams. Once funny lines like ""Would you believe..."" and ""Missed it by that much"" out of Carell's mouth lack any humor or flair that Adams gave them week after week. Agent 99 now seems cold and calculated lacking any of the warmth Barbara Feldon originally gave her. And as for The Chief, well he now acts like, well, Alan Arkin, instead of depressingly frustrated with 86's antics, he's angry and hot-headed to the point of violence. Add in new cast members like over-acting Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as Agent 23, Max's rival and mentor, and nerdy tech guys Bruce & Lloyd (who during the production of this film made a spin-off film of their very own), something is very missing in this remake. Simply put, this 2008 production is just too weak as a modern day spy film and not funny enough to be a successful comedic parody. It sort of lays flat, playing out as a reminder of how great and entertaining the original 60's show was. Sure, the Russian scenes are nice (be it I doubt they were really there on set), a couple of the gadgets have a tad of laughs, and the cameos by some famous faces are cool to see, overall this film should land in the ""forgotten remake pile"" with copies of I-Spy, My Favorite Martian, and The Wild, Wild West.As for the disc itself, you can imagine the video/audio quality which is satisfactory for a 2008 film, but my review on the single-disc here should note you don't get much with just one. The only special feature here is an option to see the film in an ""Expanded 62% More Laughs"" version with an introduction by Carell. With it, you can see different takes and versions of scenes that already are in the film. However, with this process on other discs instead of a small icon appearing at the bottom corner of your screen, a Flash-like animation takes up the entire picture screaming at you to hit your ""Enter"" button now, and after four or five of these it gets extremely irritating. No wonder they gave this only 62%, because each alternate take explains why they weren't good enough to make the final cut. The Two-Disc does offer more behind the scenes, but at the cost I doubt they would be worth it when the movie itself isn't really rewatchable.In the end, I can only suggest this to die-hard fans of the original series, as newbies to the franchise will find this too typical and not funny enough. And each true fan should realize that one of the movie's best accomplishments is that it was made after Don Adams' passing, so he couldn't call Carell on his shoe and say ""Missed it by that much"".(RedSabbath Rating:6.0/10)",2,Adams To Carell:Missed It By THAT Much.....,1226102400,"11 8, 2008",2008,4290,"['Being', 'TV', 'obsessed', 'kid', 'mid', '70', 'afternoons', 'were', 'usually', 'filled', 'syndicated', 'shows', 'decade', 'One', 'shows', 'caught', 'eye', 'was', 'Get', 'Smart', 'Started', '1965', 'was', 'spy', 'comedy', 'USA', 'answer', 'James', 'Bond', 'comedic', 'flair', 'Don', 'Adams', 'played', 'Maxwell', 'Agent', '86', 'Smart', 'bumbling', 'yet', 'charismatic', 'spy', 'working', 'secret', 'organization', 'Control', 'fight', 'Kaos', 'Russian', 'Cold', 'War', 'equivalent', 'Surrounded', 'cast', 'equally', 'interesting', 'characters', 'including', 'younger', 'more', 'competent', 'female', 'partner', 'Agent', '99', 'always', 'frustrated', 'Max', 'foolishness', 'Chief', 'Get', 'Smart', 'was', 'mix', 'old-school', 'spy', 'tricks', 'gadgets', 'good', 'word-play', 'humor.Now', 'flashing', 'forward', 'forty-five', 'years', 'later', 'Hollywood', 'remake', 'machine', 'once', 'again', 'dips', 'pockets', 'out', 'yet', 'classic', 'put', 'kindly', 'modernization', 'today', 'technology', 'special', 'effects', 'can', 'new', 'team', 'actors', 'bring', 'back', 'spies', 'world', 'where', 'Cold', 'War', 'forgotten', 'memory', 'Just', 'looking', 'new', 'cast', 'can', 'tell', 'visually', 'director', 'Peter', '50', 'First', 'Dates', 'Segal', 'wanted', 'preserve', 'respect', 'original', 'cast', 'aspect', 'so', 'very', 'well', 'Just', 'looking', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'resemblance', 'Don', 'Adams', 'uncanny', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'who', 'career', 'bit', 'too', 'big', 'now', 'role', 'Agent', '99', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Chief', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'think', 'other', 'actor', 'roles', 'today', 'one', 'thing', 'noticable', 'fans', 'old', 'series', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'even', 'look', 'originals', 'acting-wise', ""'re"", 'nowhere', 'close', 'Carell', 'Smart', 'downright', 'dead-panned', 'completely', 'ignoring', 'standards', 'set', 'Adams', 'Once', 'funny', 'lines', 'Would', 'believe', 'Missed', 'much', 'Carell', 'mouth', 'lack', 'humor', 'flair', 'Adams', 'gave', 'week', 'week', '99', 'now', 'cold', 'calculated', 'lacking', 'warmth', 'Barbara', 'Feldon', 'originally', 'gave', 'Chief', 'well', 'now', 'well', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'instead', 'depressingly', 'frustrated', '86', 'antics', 'angry', 'hot-headed', 'point', 'violence', 'Add', 'new', 'cast', 'members', 'over-acting', 'Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'Agent', '23', 'Max', 'rival', 'mentor', 'nerdy', 'tech', 'guys', 'Bruce', 'Lloyd', 'who', 'production', 'film', 'made', 'spin-off', 'film', 'very', 'own', 'something', 'very', 'missing', 'remake', 'Simply', 'put', '2008', 'production', 'just', 'too', 'weak', 'modern', 'day', 'spy', 'film', 'not', 'funny', 'enough', 'be', 'successful', 'comedic', 'parody', 'sort', 'lays', 'flat', 'playing', 'out', 'reminder', 'how', 'great', 'entertaining', 'original', '60', 'show', 'was', 'Sure', 'Russian', 'scenes', 'are', 'nice', 'be', 'doubt', 'were', 'really', 'there', 'set', 'couple', 'gadgets', 'have', 'tad', 'laughs', 'cameos', 'famous', 'are', 'cool', 'see', 'overall', 'film', 'should', 'land', 'forgotten', 'remake', 'pile', 'copies', 'I-Spy', 'My', 'Favorite', 'Martian', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West.As', 'disc', 'can', 'imagine', 'video/audio', 'quality', 'satisfactory', '2008', 'film', 'review', 'single-disc', 'here', 'should', 'note', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'just', 'one', 'only', 'special', 'feature', 'here', 'option', 'see', 'film', 'Expanded', '62', '%', 'More', 'Laughs', 'version', 'introduction', 'Carell', 'can', 'see', 'different', 'versions', 'scenes', 'already', 'are', 'film', 'However', 'process', 'other', 'discs', 'instead', 'small', 'icon', 'appearing', 'bottom', 'corner', 'screen', 'Flash-like', 'animation', 'up', 'entire', 'picture', 'screaming', 'hit', 'Enter', 'button', 'now', 'four', 'five', 'extremely', 'irritating', 'wonder', 'gave', 'only', '62', '%', 'alternate', 'take', 'explains', 'why', 'were', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'final', 'cut', 'Two-Disc', 'offer', 'more', 'scenes', 'cost', 'doubt', 'would', 'be', 'when', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'rewatchable.In', 'end', 'can', 'only', 'suggest', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'original', 'series', 'newbies', 'franchise', 'will', 'find', 'too', 'typical', 'not', 'funny', 'enough', 'true', 'fan', 'should', 'realize', 'one', 'movie', 'best', 'accomplishments', 'was', 'made', 'Don', 'Adams', 'passing', 'could', ""n't"", 'call', 'Carell', 'shoe', 'say', 'Missed', 'much', 'RedSabbath', 'Rating:6.0/10']",Get Smart

1197984,A12WZTC4YJ8ZEC,B001GMAVGE,Ethan D Van Vorst,"[1, 1]","I've waded through dozens of remakes of old TV series and movies. And if there is one constant in the universe that I have learned it is that in every single case the original idea was done better and really didn't need a remake in the first place. And yet Hollywood would keep pumping the things out just to keep the income flowing with seemingly no regard for it's general poopiness. There is absolutely no reason I was expecting to enjoy Get Smart! as much as I did, but enjoy it I did in spades.Get Smart! was a TV program of the 1960's starring Don Adams as inept but likeable Agent 86 (modern audiences will recognize Adams as the voice of ""Inspector Gadget"", which itself was not too dissimilar from Get Smart). In it Agent 86 spent each episode trying to thwart the activites of KAOS, a quasi-terrorist organization based upon more serious types found in the James Bond movies. Agent 86 used a variety of Bond-esque devices, notably his shoe, which contained a phone and other doo-dads to help him get through each episode. Accompanying him was the attractive Agent 99 and each week the two would stop the henchmen of KAOS. I watched reruns of the show when I was around 8 years old but I honestly don't remember much except for what I wrote above, as well as the now-famous intro scene with Max Smart going through dozens of sliding heavy-metal doors to get to a phone booth where he would, presumably, receive his orders.In this incarnation Maxwell Smart, played by Steve Carrell of ""The Office""), has finally succeeded in becoming a full-fledged agent after several years of taking agent exams (and overcoming a helluva eating disorder) and is finally sent into the field after HQ is forcibly dissassembled by a double agent working with KAOS. Accompanying him is the more experienced Agent 99, played by Anne Hathaway. Hathaway's serious nature and Smart's unintentional funniness make for a surprisingly good on-screen chemistry between the two, which I honestly wasn't expecting. After a while a friendly rivalry springs up between the two in which they try to outdo one another (the dance scene being a hilarious example) and eventually come to have a serious attraction for each other.Also included is an appearance by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as super-suave Agent 23, whom Max aspires to be like, and Alan Arkin as ""The Chief"". The movie starts out a little slow but by the time the ""Cone of Silence"" drops you'll be laughing your glutials off, and quite often. Carrell's scene in the airplane bathroom is an absolute riot!

Did those reviewers see the same movie as I did? I'm guessing they did, but they may, like myself, have seen the trailer for the movie and determined that it was going to be a mere extension of the television show (I remember specifically from the trailer the scene where Max, played by Steve Carell, has trouble getting the telephone booth open.  This caused me to wince then, as it does now.  Fortunately, that scene was not in the final movie).While watching a video on a TV, even a large screen high-definitiion model, tends to make one subconsciously lower ones expectations, I found GET SMART, the single disc, Widescreen Edition, to be fast paced, funny, and an even good, not great, action movie.Prior to watching this movie, I was concerned that the memories of the original GET SMART television show would spoil my enjoyment, but the few gags carried over from the television show, like the Cone of Silence, were upgraded in such a manner as to be even more humorous.The actors were especially well suited to the roles with Steve Carnell playing the analyst Maxwell Smart, Anne Hathaway playing cool and calm Agent 99, Dwayne Johnson as the do everything with a bit of bravura Agent 23, and Alan Arkin as the ""When did I lose control of Control"" Chief.  The premise of the movie is that Maxwell Smart is tired of being an analyst, so we see him trying out for the 8th time to pass the agent's exam.  His previous attempts failed mainly because of his being overweight, but on the 8th time, he passed, only to have his promotion overturned by the Chief because he is needed too much as an analyst.  Unfortunately for Control, and fortunately for Max, something compromises the identity of the Control agents, so he is brought into service.What follows is a rather uncomplicated plot, with good action sequences, and top-rated acting by all.The disc comes with a ""Comedy Optimization Mode"" with ""Get Smart Takes,"" that show during the playing of the movie alternative dialogue and scenes that were not used.  I would suggest you watch the movie first without the ""Comedy Optimization Mode"" so the tempo of the movie isn't slowed down too much on your first viewing.This is a movie I would recommend to anyone 13 or older, there is some light profanity in the ""Comedy Optimization Mode"" that doesn't appear in the actual movie, and I found this movie well worth a second viewing just to see what one missed the first time through.",4,It missed Getting 5 Stars By This Much >  &lt;,1225843200,"11 5, 2008",2008,2553,"['When', 'GET', 'SMART', 'was', 'theaters', 'reviews', 'were', 'little', 'so-so', 'chose', 'wait', 'came-out', 'DVD', 'Did', 'reviewers', 'see', 'same', 'movie', 'did', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'did', 'may', 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'trailer', 'movie', 'determined', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'mere', 'extension', 'television', 'show', 'remember', 'specifically', 'trailer', 'scene', 'where', 'Max', 'played', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'trouble', 'getting', 'telephone', 'open', 'caused', 'wince', 'then', 'now', 'Fortunately', 'scene', 'was', 'not', 'final', 'movie', 'watching', 'video', 'TV', 'even', 'large', 'screen', 'high-definitiion', 'model', 'make', 'one', 'subconsciously', 'lower', 'ones', 'expectations', 'found', 'GET', 'SMART', 'single', 'disc', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'be', 'fast', 'paced', 'funny', 'even', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'action', 'movie.Prior', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'concerned', 'memories', 'original', 'GET', 'SMART', 'television', 'show', 'would', 'spoil', 'enjoyment', 'few', 'gags', 'carried', 'television', 'show', 'Cone', 'Silence', 'were', 'upgraded', 'such', 'manner', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'humorous.The', 'actors', 'were', 'especially', 'well', 'suited', 'roles', 'Steve', 'Carnell', 'playing', 'analyst', 'Maxwell', 'Smart', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'playing', 'cool', 'calm', 'Agent', '99', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'do', 'everything', 'bit', 'bravura', 'Agent', '23', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'When', 'did', 'lose', 'control', 'Control', 'Chief', 'premise', 'movie', 'Maxwell', 'Smart', 'tired', 'being', 'analyst', 'see', 'trying', 'out', '8th', 'time', 'pass', 'agent', 'exam', 'previous', 'attempts', 'failed', 'mainly', 'being', 'overweight', '8th', 'time', 'passed', 'only', 'have', 'promotion', 'overturned', 'Chief', 'needed', 'too', 'much', 'analyst', 'Unfortunately', 'Control', 'fortunately', 'Max', 'something', 'identity', 'Control', 'agents', 'brought', 'service.What', 'rather', 'uncomplicated', 'plot', 'good', 'action', 'sequences', 'top-rated', 'acting', 'all.The', 'disc', 'Comedy', 'Optimization', 'Mode', 'Get', 'Smart', 'Takes', 'show', 'playing', 'movie', 'alternative', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'used', 'would', 'suggest', 'watch', 'movie', 'first', 'Comedy', 'Optimization', 'Mode', 'tempo', 'movie', ""n't"", 'slowed', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'first', 'viewing.This', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', '13', 'older', 'light', 'profanity', 'Comedy', 'Optimization', 'Mode', ""n't"", 'appear', 'actual', 'movie', 'found', 'movie', 'well', 'second', 'viewing', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'one', 'missed', 'first', 'time']",Get Smart

Whenever I watch the old show I can't help but constantly laugh, as much as I tried to do the same with the movie I could not do so once, not once. The only remotely funny joke was the one about Max asking how to get the bad guys to take the cyanide pill he is equipped with and guess what, they took that one right out of an episode I watched a couple of months ago. The theater I saw this was fairly packed and even the usual group in the audience who'll laugh at anything was pretty silent. Instead of wasting millions of dollars the producers would have provided audiences with a much better entertainment if they had simply pasted together about 4 old episodes. It's a shame Hollywood can be so good at blowing things up but so terrible at providing laughter and excitement. And regarding Hathaway as agent 99, my only recommendation to her would be to never again in her life try comedy again, ever. It's just not for her, period.

The movie was pretty well-casted, and held my attention for the entire time.A couple of people criticized this movie because it doesn't do justice to the original Get Smart TV series of the 1960s. But even though there's supposed to be a connection between this movie and the old series, I think you should watch this movie with an open mind. Don't hold the same expectations for the 2008 movie that you had for the 1960s TV show, because there are probably good reasons why the ""Get Smart"" movie is different from the original series.

1198011,A1EARN5PUVIF1S,B001GMAVGE,Jerry P. Danzig,"[7, 15]","Why does Hollywood persist in producing horrendous remakes of classic TV series?  Because they figure that these efforts are pre-sold commodities, I guess.So here is another in a continuing roster of dreadful films guaranteed to make fans of the original series wince in pain (others that come to mind include ""Bewitched,"" ""The Avengers,"" and ""Rocky and Bullwinkle,"" to name just three).If you're going to remake a beloved TV series, then for heaven's sake, make it true to the things that people loved best about the show.  For some reason, the hacks who make these movies think that they can improve on the originals, and nine times out of ten, they can't.The first problem here is Maxwell Smart himself, as played by Steve Carell.  To be fair, Carell had giant shoephones to fill, those of Don Adams, who was pretty much born to play Smart on TV (and before Smart, an identical Detective character, named Glick if memory serves me, on the Bill Dana show).Smart is a classic comic character because, like Inspector Clouseau, he has absolute confidence in his abilities, which are continually shown to be all but nonexistent.  The huge gap between his supreme confidence and his staggering ineptitude produces the comedy.  In this movie, however, Smart is shown to be a Control analyst suffering from doubt and a midlife crisis.  That stance is just wrong for the character.Similarly, as blind as TV Smart was to his incompetence, he was equally blind to his source of greatest good fortune -- the devotion to him shown by the beautiful and extremely competent Agent 99, who prevails as often as he fails.In the show, 99's adoration was sweet if misguided.  Here, 99, as played by Anne Hathaway, is shown to be quite put off by Smart's lack of field experience, and so their relationship starts off brittle and cold, and not at all credible when the couple do warm up by film's end.As for the humor of the movie, it mostly consists of sadistic sight gags like memos being stapled to people's foreheads or Max hurting himself with a tricked-out professional-strength Swiss Army Knife.  What little wit shines through comes from quotes of the famous catch phrases of the series (""Missed it by that much"", ""Would you believe"", and the like.)In place of the original's sharp characterizations and humor, we get pretty photography of Moscow and one big-budget (but not very funny) chase scene.  Plus the luscious Anne Hathaway, who deserves much better fare than this.  The only extra on the DVD is a handful of alternate scenes; the ones included in the theatrical release were so painful, I opted not to endure those as well.So if you haven't ever seen ""Get Smart"" on TV, by all means check out the first season of that riotous spy spoof instead.  If you have, then do yourself a favor and steer clear of this dog (and I don't mean Agent Fang).",1,Get Smart -- and Watch the Original Series Instead,1284595200,"09 16, 2010",2010,2842,"['Why', 'Hollywood', 'persist', 'producing', 'horrendous', 'remakes', 'classic', 'TV', 'series', 'figure', 'efforts', 'are', 'pre-sold', 'commodities', 'guess.So', 'here', 'continuing', 'roster', 'dreadful', 'films', 'guaranteed', 'make', 'fans', 'original', 'series', 'wince', 'pain', 'others', 'come', 'mind', 'include', 'Bewitched', 'Avengers', 'Rocky', 'Bullwinkle', 'name', 'just', 'three', '.If', ""'re"", 'going', 'remake', 'beloved', 'TV', 'series', 'then', 'heaven', 'sake', 'make', 'true', 'things', 'people', 'loved', 'best', 'show', 'reason', 'hacks', 'who', 'make', 'movies', 'think', 'can', 'improve', 'originals', 'nine', 'times', 'ten', ""can't.The"", 'first', 'problem', 'here', 'Maxwell', 'Smart', 'played', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'be', 'fair', 'Carell', 'had', 'giant', 'shoephones', 'fill', 'Don', 'Adams', 'who', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'born', 'play', 'Smart', 'TV', 'Smart', 'identical', 'Detective', 'character', 'named', 'Glick', 'memory', 'serves', 'Bill', 'Dana', 'show', '.Smart', 'classic', 'comic', 'character', 'Inspector', 'Clouseau', 'absolute', 'confidence', 'abilities', 'are', 'continually', 'shown', 'be', 'nonexistent', 'huge', 'gap', 'supreme', 'confidence', 'staggering', 'ineptitude', 'comedy', 'movie', 'however', 'Smart', 'shown', 'be', 'Control', 'analyst', 'suffering', 'doubt', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'stance', 'just', 'wrong', 'character.Similarly', 'as', 'blind', 'TV', 'Smart', 'was', 'incompetence', 'was', 'equally', 'blind', 'source', 'greatest', 'good', 'fortune', 'devotion', 'shown', 'beautiful', 'extremely', 'competent', 'Agent', '99', 'who', 'as', 'often', 'show', '99', 'adoration', 'was', 'sweet', 'misguided', 'Here', '99', 'played', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'shown', 'be', 'quite', 'put', 'off', 'Smart', 'lack', 'field', 'experience', 'so', 'relationship', 'brittle', 'cold', 'not', 'credible', 'when', 'couple', 'do', 'warm', 'up', 'film', 'end.As', 'humor', 'movie', 'mostly', 'sadistic', 'sight', 'gags', 'memos', 'being', 'stapled', 'people', 'foreheads', 'Max', 'hurting', 'tricked-out', 'professional-strength', 'Swiss', 'Army', 'Knife', 'What', 'little', 'wit', 'shines', 'quotes', 'famous', 'catch', 'phrases', 'series', 'Missed', 'much', 'Would', 'believe', 'like', 'place', 'original', 'sharp', 'characterizations', 'humor', 'get', 'pretty', 'photography', 'Moscow', 'one', 'big-budget', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'chase', 'scene', 'luscious', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'who', 'much', 'better', 'fare', 'only', 'extra', 'DVD', 'handful', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'ones', 'included', 'theatrical', 'release', 'were', 'so', 'painful', 'opted', 'not', 'endure', 'well.So', 'have', ""n't"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Get', 'Smart', 'TV', 'means', 'check', 'out', 'first', 'season', 'riotous', 'spy', 'spoof', 'instead', 'have', 'then', 'do', 'favor', 'steer', 'clear', 'dog', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Agent', 'Fang']",Get Smart

GET SMART, the movie remake of the 1960s hit comedy series of the same name, is in no way true to the spirit of Maxwell Smart.  The original series was cute, warm, and wacky; a patriotic slap-stick comedy.  The modern day movie, GET SMART, isn't even a parody of the TV series; rather, it is a very pale and hollow interpretation of an American institution.Neither my husband nor I found the movie version of GET SMART to be funny.  There were maybe two spots where we actually laughed (and hence, two stars instead of one); however, most of the time, we never even smiled.  Where the original was clever and quirky, the movie is banal and pedestrian, relying on too many insipid off color or fat jokes instead of real humor.  Where the first Agent 99 truly cared about Agent 86, from the first time she met him, this Agent 99 can't stand Max and he has to fight to win her approval.  Where the original Max was bumbling and lovable, this Max is clumsy, off-putting, and very dull.There are times when a ""stupid movie"" can be really fun.  In this case, the stupid movie, GET SMART, is just plain stupid.  There is almost nothing to recommend GET SMART.  Especially since the villain is clearly telegraphed from the beginning.

When the headquarters of U.S. spy agency Control is attacked and the identities of its agents compromised, the Chief has no choice but to promote his ever-eager analyst Maxwell Smart, who has always dreamt of working in the field alongside stalwart superstar Agent 23. Smart is partnered instead with the only other agent whose identity has not been compromised: the lovely-but-lethal veteran Agent 99. As Smart and 99 get closer to unraveling KAOS' master plan--and each other--they discover that key KAOS operative Siegfried and his sidekick Shtarker are scheming to cash in with their network of terror. Given little field experience and even less time, Smart--armed with nothing but a few spy-tech gadgets and his unbridled enthusiasm--must defeat KAOS if he is to save the day.

And, ultimately, I wished I'd listened to my two roommates who saw it opening night and hated it.  I thought it was okay, but there were other things I could have done with my time and money.While most people think the Communist organization KAOS died at the end of the cold war, it really went under ground.  So, too, did the US organization devoted to stopping it, CONTROL.  Maxwell Smart (Steve Carell) is their top analyst, but he secretly desires to be an agent because they get all the glory.  His idol is Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson), not only the best, but a popular nice guy.  But The Chief (Alan Arkin) won't promote Max because his extremely detailed reports are critical to the success of the agency.All that changes when KAOS manages to attack CONTROL's main office.  With all their agents' identities exposed, Max has to team up with Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) to discover KAOS' plan.  But Agent 99 is less than thrilled to be working with an obvious rookie who is a bit of a spaz.  Can the two stay alive long enough for CONTOL to gain ... well, control?Fans of the original show will see glimpses of what they loved here, including some of the outdated gadgets that were cutting edge for the 60's.  Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway do a good job of making the characters their own while also recalling the originals.  And the rest of the cast is entertaining in their parts.But while the original was a sitcom, this is an action comedy.  The plot was fairly predictable, but I certainly got caught up in it and was holding my breath for the climax.There was still humor here.  Some of Max's antics were funny, but I found too much of it stemmed from bathroom humor and sexual situations for my tastes.  These were what earned the movie its well deserved PG-13.  The funniest bits went to the two gadget geeks, Lloyd and Bruce, and the agents who were reduced to being analysts.  If the movie had had more of them, I would have enjoyed it more.Then there's the message the film is trying to send out.  I think it might have been trying to skewer both sides of the political spectrum.  But if that's the case, it didn't work.  Instead, I was left confused about what it was trying to say.  I've got to say, however, that one line the villain has related to all this got the loudest laugh from me.I wish I enjoyed all of this movie because I enjoyed most of the film.

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[2, 4]","I was a fan of Don Adam's portrayal of Maxwell Smart in the original series, a show that was funny and silly, but also biting and clever far ahead of it's time. One of our daughters saw the new film and said she laughed her head off the whole way through. The Mrs. and I agreed we should check it out. We were not disappointed.Steve Carrell does not try an impersonation of Don Adams, but the writers and performers do a great job of staying true to the spirit of the original while updating it in a way that our daughters, who wouldn't know Don Adams from John Quincy Adams, LIKED it.We liked it too. All of the ""great bits"" from the old series are weaved in, at least momentarily, and sometimes I was laughing at the subtle homage. But at other times the filmmakers wisely decided to put Steve Carrell in a room and turn him loose. He has a scene in an airplane lavatory with a ""special"" Swiss Army knife that MUST be seen, although the Mrs. recommends you not have a full bladder when you do. Another scene involving one of those movie laser security systems and a rodent had me howling. My brother and I are big fans of ""Chuck Norris Jokes/Facts"", and I had to call him immediately after the film to tell him he HAD to see it (after our mutual disappointment at the new Indiana Jones.)The plot is a skeleton on which to hang the multiple hilarious bits, but it works fairly well as a spy movie. Some of the Bond or Flint movies had plots twice as idiotic, and they weren't supposed to be comedies.Carrell is ably supported by Anne Hathaway as Agent 99. She has several great moments - flashing her long legs on a dance floor and saving Max from certain death in a mid-air rescue involving a parachute and a kiss.Alan Arkin brings the perfect pitch to this tale as the Chief, with one foot squarely planted in the ""serious spy world"" of government, and the other foot ready to observe Smart's silliness.I was ready to laugh at a movie and this one delivered.

1198054,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B001GMAVGE,Micheal Hunt,"[2, 8]","Over the last few years with internet and chat developments, I have met many American people and discussed classic TV thousands of times... the one topic I was always surprised at was how many Americans I had talked to who had not heard of ""Get Smart""...would you believe it?Logging into Amazon right now to see how many 5 and 4 star votes this movie has gotten, I can only come to terms that they are the ones who have no idea that this movie is based on a classic 1960's TV show. If they had have seen the original Mel Brooks creation starring Don Adams as Maxwell Smart: Secret Agent 86 (Also the voice of Inspector Gadget) and Barbra Feldon as 99, as well as all the terrific supporting roles by so many other great actors, then they would see that this movie does not hold a flame to the original series, and is almost a complete embarrassment to it.The 40 Year Old Virgin playing Maxwell does not portray the character of Max well. Maxwell should be sophisticated, charming, a smooth talker when he wants to be while also being a bit goofy, a stumbling klutz, and almost cartoon-like in certain ways. Steve portrays him as a geeky loser who can not produce the timing needed to pull off the classic quotes.Whoever is playing 99 was about the only one I think did any research on her character. She sounded a little like Barbra Feldon, and looked a little like her in ways, but she did not act like 99. She needed to lose the bitchyness and self involvement.The chemistry between those two characters was not there. First they hate each other, then all of a sudden Max breaks wind and she finds him charming, and suddenly they're an item? For starters, the original 99 and 86 would never insult each other, it felt too uncomfortable to see these two fighting and arguing and trying to out do each other for a better part of the movie. I know they trying to update this thing to tell the story in a modern day way, but there are some things that do not work with these well known and classic characters.Whoever played Siegfried almost looked the part at first, and at first I thought this evil sinister approach might be a good idea... but when he delivers a classic Siegfried line... he says it in a way that is just not humorous. Maybe they where going for it, but I think it failed.The Rock, Dwayne Johnson is in here as agent 23, big deal, he seemed to add little to nothing being in this movie.Larrabee as a bully? wt???? The Chief did not seem to be a good casting choice, the two poor attempts at geeky side-liners needed to go, and don't forget the stale as hell jokes of the fat person comedy relief gags... oh yeah, the sudden hit by a bus thing... we've seen that 1000 times already and it wasn't funny the first time. Are Hollyweed writers still on strike or something?What this movie needed badly was Mel Brooks. Why wasn't he asked to make this film? Go over the script, add something, just SOMETHING to this movie to improve it and make it feel like something new, with that old familiar feeling to it? Least Mel would have gotten some kind of laugh from the pathetic attempt they had at an updated ""cone of silence"" gag.On the comedy scale, I did not laugh as much as I hoped. I had a few chuckles, but nothing that I would say was hilarious or genius. And the worst part about it is, no matter how well this movie does, you can tell they have already written a sequel.. hell, there is even already a spin off available on DVD of the two geeks, and this movie isn't even on DVD yet.... gimme a break... there is no way anyone will remember the spin off to this in 2 years time.I have talked about all the cons so far, so can I say anything nice about the movie? A couple of things; It was good to see the original Siegfried (Bernie Kopell) get a cameo appearance in a decently thought of idea to pay homage to the original Get Smart series vehicles. Interesting to see Bill Murray trying to be funny again, and err... if I happen to think of anything else, I'll get back to you.Overall: Barely got to being an average movie.

1198073,A3PWPNZVMNX3PA,B001GMAVGE,rareoopdvds,"[1, 1]","This DVD release purports that there are 62% more laughs than the original. It would indicate, then, that the original theatrical release lacks 62% of its humor, which is probably accurate.I grew up with my family enjoying the original television series, yet I never got into it. But I am familiar with the characters enough to watch this movie and have an idea of what I am about to see. Steve Carell stars as Maxwell Smart, who is out for his first official duty as an agent in active duty, despite his expertise in research. He eventually is paired up with the incredibly sexy Anne Hathaway, as Agent 99. Together, they are an excellent team and work very well together. Hathaway is surprisingly on time with her comedic delivery and is able to keep up with Carell.The movie plays out entertainingly with little wasted space in the film. In light of Hathaway and Carell's excellent chemistry together, the comedy in the film is flattened by the action. I did not find myself laughing out loud in any of the scenes, although they should have been funny. I cannot pin point exactly what was missing, or maybe simply the fact I expect Maxwell Smart that humor be his character flaw, rather than a humorous situation.Dwayne Johnson as Agent 23, actually provides more of the unexpected humor in the film than anyone else. He has grown out of his wrestling roots as well as his all-out muscle-head action hero stereotype and can be taken seriously (even in a comedy).Alan Arkin rounds out the main characters as the head of control who is totally in his environment and plays it off perfectly. Surprisingly, there are some nice cameos throughout the film like Kevin Nealon and Bill Murray.Despite how much I liked the film, there is the element of comedy that is missing. Well, let me justify that. I am not sure this film needs to be as funny as it advertises. Its probably difficult to advertise this film as something that is a good action film with some light humor. With Carell in the lead, its hard to advertise he is serious in his role, despite that his character has humorous qualities. So the advertising just leaned all the way in comedy - which is where the disappointment comes in (or misrepresentation).In sum, Carell is perfectly cast as Maxwell Smart, to the point where he almost looks like Don Adams in the original TV series. Hathaway is not only sexy to watch, but shows intelligence and strength in her role. She is perfectly capable of holding the scene on her own, and also allowing the other cast to be part of the scene. She might be the one reason to see the film. If she is not already a major star, expect her to be very soon! GET SMART is a well crafted film in every way with expectantly funny bits that do not get in the way of the action (if not undermined). I do recommend the film to watch, but whether to own is at your discretion.",4,Great Chemistry Despite Lack of Laughs,1226102400,"11 8, 2008",2008,2864,"['DVD', 'release', 'are', '62', '%', 'more', 'laughs', 'original', 'would', 'indicate', 'then', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', '62', '%', 'humor', 'probably', 'accurate.I', 'grew', 'up', 'family', 'enjoying', 'original', 'television', 'series', 'never', 'got', 'am', 'familiar', 'characters', 'enough', 'watch', 'movie', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'am', 'see', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Maxwell', 'Smart', 'who', 'out', 'first', 'official', 'duty', 'agent', 'active', 'duty', 'expertise', 'research', 'eventually', 'paired', 'up', 'incredibly', 'sexy', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Agent', '99', 'Together', 'are', 'excellent', 'team', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'together', 'Hathaway', 'surprisingly', 'time', 'comedic', 'delivery', 'able', 'keep', 'up', 'Carell.The', 'movie', 'out', 'entertainingly', 'little', 'wasted', 'space', 'film', 'light', 'Hathaway', 'Carell', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'together', 'comedy', 'film', 'flattened', 'action', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'can', 'not', 'pin', 'point', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'maybe', 'simply', 'fact', 'expect', 'Maxwell', 'Smart', 'humor', 'be', 'character', 'flaw', 'rather', 'humorous', 'situation.Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'Agent', '23', 'actually', 'more', 'unexpected', 'humor', 'film', 'anyone', 'else', 'grown', 'wrestling', 'roots', 'as', 'well', 'all-out', 'muscle-head', 'action', 'hero', 'stereotype', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'even', 'comedy', '.Alan', 'Arkin', 'out', 'main', 'characters', 'head', 'control', 'who', 'totally', 'environment', 'off', 'perfectly', 'Surprisingly', 'are', 'nice', 'cameos', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'Bill', 'Murray.Despite', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'film', 'element', 'comedy', 'missing', 'Well', 'let', 'justify', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'film', 'be', 'as', 'funny', 'probably', 'difficult', 'advertise', 'film', 'something', 'good', 'action', 'film', 'light', 'humor', 'Carell', 'lead', 'hard', 'advertise', 'serious', 'role', 'character', 'humorous', 'qualities', 'advertising', 'just', 'leaned', 'way', 'comedy', 'where', 'disappointment', 'misrepresentation', '.In', 'sum', 'Carell', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Maxwell', 'Smart', 'point', 'where', 'almost', 'Don', 'Adams', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'Hathaway', 'not', 'only', 'sexy', 'watch', 'intelligence', 'strength', 'role', 'perfectly', 'capable', 'holding', 'scene', 'own', 'also', 'allowing', 'other', 'cast', 'be', 'part', 'scene', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'reason', 'see', 'film', 'not', 'already', 'major', 'star', 'expect', 'be', 'very', 'soon', 'GET', 'SMART', 'well', 'crafted', 'film', 'way', 'expectantly', 'funny', 'bits', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'way', 'action', 'not', 'undermined', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'watch', 'own', 'discretion']",Get Smart

1198083,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B001GMAVGE,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[1, 3]","Max Smart does his job too well.  As an analyst for CONTROL, the most classified of covert counter-espionage agencies, Max delivers intelligence reports that almost nobody ever reads.  Max dreams of the day when he can join his idols, Agents 23 (Dwayne Johnson) and 99 (Ann Hathaway), but his boss decides that Max is too important to waste him in the field.When CONTROL's seemingly secure headquarters is attacked from within, and its roster of worldwide agents is compromised, Max is hastily promoted to ""Agent"" and foisted on a reluctant Agent 99.  Their mission: find the base of the likely attackers, the implacable KAOS, and destroy it.  Led by the sinister Siegfried (Terence Stamp), KAOS's attack is likely the prelude to an even wider attack.  Lacking spy-smarts, and to 99's chagrin, Max finds his training sorely inadequate to the task.I don't want to say any more about the movie's plot, which could have fit snugly in an episode of the show.  That said, ""Get Smart"" is actually a lot of fun, seldom hilarious, ""Get Smart"" manages to be consistently funny and entertaining.  The smooth script deftly maneuvers between newer material and the original - never losing sight of what made the old show fun while also not being enslaved by it.The movie's strengths are its stars - impossible to overlook how this could have been another Hollywood retread of an old TV show, it's the performances that bring ""Get Smart"" over the top.  Alan Arkin is great as Chief, while Stamp deserves real props for managing to be funny (rather than pathetic) playing the most serious guy in a comedy.  Best of all are Steve Carrel and Hathaway.  Carrel creates a Max that is decidedly different from Don Adams (though he does channel Adams in one extended sequence set in a hidden KAOS weapons factory, possibly as a tribute, but also to remind you how far Carrel has gone his own way).  Hathaway is surprisingly effective as 99 (at times she even sounds like Barbara Feldon), playing as the sexy counterpoint to Max's undersexed virgin spy.  Never a laugh riot, ""Get Smart"" supplies a steady stream of funny lines, and you'll likely be chortling about ""muffins of mass destruction"" long after you forgot you caught this flick.",4,A lot of fun,1240444800,"04 23, 2009",2009,2218,"['Max', 'Smart', 'job', 'too', 'well', 'analyst', 'CONTROL', 'most', 'classified', 'covert', 'counter-espionage', 'agencies', 'Max', 'delivers', 'intelligence', 'reports', 'almost', 'nobody', 'ever', 'Max', 'dreams', 'day', 'when', 'can', 'join', 'idols', 'Agents', '23', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', '99', 'Ann', 'Hathaway', 'boss', 'Max', 'too', 'important', 'waste', 'field.When', 'CONTROL', 'seemingly', 'secure', 'headquarters', 'attacked', 'roster', 'worldwide', 'agents', 'compromised', 'Max', 'hastily', 'promoted', 'Agent', 'foisted', 'reluctant', 'Agent', '99', 'mission', 'find', 'base', 'likely', 'attackers', 'implacable', 'KAOS', 'destroy', 'Led', 'sinister', 'Siegfried', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'KAOS', 'attack', 'likely', 'prelude', 'even', 'wider', 'attack', 'Lacking', 'spy-smarts', '99', 'chagrin', 'Max', 'training', 'sorely', 'inadequate', 'task.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'more', 'movie', 'plot', 'could', 'have', 'fit', 'snugly', 'episode', 'show', 'said', 'Get', 'Smart', 'actually', 'lot', 'fun', 'seldom', 'hilarious', 'Get', 'Smart', 'be', 'consistently', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'smooth', 'script', 'deftly', 'maneuvers', 'newer', 'material', 'original', 'never', 'losing', 'sight', 'what', 'made', 'old', 'show', 'fun', 'also', 'not', 'being', 'enslaved', 'it.The', 'movie', 'strengths', 'are', 'stars', 'impossible', 'overlook', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Hollywood', 'retread', 'old', 'TV', 'show', 'performances', 'bring', 'Get', 'Smart', 'top', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'great', 'Chief', 'Stamp', 'real', 'props', 'managing', 'be', 'funny', 'rather', 'pathetic', 'playing', 'most', 'serious', 'guy', 'comedy', 'Best', 'are', 'Steve', 'Carrel', 'Hathaway', 'Carrel', 'Max', 'decidedly', 'different', 'Don', 'Adams', 'channel', 'Adams', 'one', 'extended', 'sequence', 'set', 'hidden', 'KAOS', 'weapons', 'factory', 'possibly', 'tribute', 'also', 'remind', 'how', 'far', 'Carrel', 'gone', 'own', 'way', 'Hathaway', 'surprisingly', 'effective', '99', 'times', 'even', 'Barbara', 'Feldon', 'playing', 'sexy', 'counterpoint', 'Max', 'undersexed', 'virgin', 'spy', 'laugh', 'riot', 'Get', 'Smart', 'steady', 'stream', 'funny', 'lines', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'be', 'chortling', 'muffins', 'mass', 'destruction', 'long', 'forgot', 'caught', 'flick']",Get Smart

This difference makes the movie very different from the tv series that disappoints many core fans.  The movie is entertaining in its own way, spoofing Entrapment, Alias, and other spy movies along the way.  One must always have a dance scene in a spy movie.What was disappointing was Siegfried and Starkel, who both lacked the goofy incompetence and humor found in the original series.  Sure, Max was a goof, but Kaos was even more inept than Control.The 2nd disc is not worth the extra money in a special edition.  The gag reel is rather short and could have been included in the 1st disc.  The 1st disc presents the alternative jokes in a very aggravating manner.  It forces you to watch the entire movie and it is constantly interrupted with the phone booth elevator.  Only by pressing the enter button when the phone booth is shown, will the alternative gag line be shown.  Very tedious to be constantly interrupted and having to press the button to watch the gags.

1198100,A25QJBK33C4O0R,B001GMAVGE,"terpfan1980 ""Barry""","[5, 6]","I've seen the theatrical version of this film twice.  Once when it was in first run, and again now on Blu-ray.  To be blunt, I thought the film was ok when it was in first run, but wasn't impressed enough with it to want to see it again.  It was and is ok in my book, but I felt it lacked somewhat, at least when compared to my memories of the original TV series.Ah, the TV series.  Total camp, but fun at the same time.  Loved by enough viewers that I can see why it would seem to be a target to mine on the bigger screen, especially with someone like Steve Carell in the lead. Carell makes a good Maxwell Smart, and if the story were better, I think this one could have been a genuine 5 star hit.  Unfortunately, as others have said here, it missed it by that much :-(Anne Hathaway is ok in taking over the Barbara Feldon role, and Alan Arkin isn't bad as the chief.  Honestly none of the performances are disappointing to me, it's just that the story itself, at least from the theatrical version isn't as funny as it should be.Which brings me back to the 62% more laughs that are promised in the Blu-ray.  Ah, more laughs from promised bonus scenes actually sounds good and enticed me to give the Blu-ray a try, but ... the presentation is just so disappointing to me that I have got to slam it in this review.Offering up a director's cut or extended cut version of a film is something that I greatly appreciate, but if you are going to do it, by all that is right in the universe please do it in a way that respects the viewer and not as done here.Seamless branching has been around in the DVD format for a while and it's used here, but isn't even close to being seamless.  Far from it, it seems that if you turn on the bonus scene viewing version of the film you get a neat little icon of Maxwell Smart in the phone booth (or at least of the phone booth) to indicate that bonus materials are now being shown.  That's not bad but... the icon is much larger than it needs to be and obliterates part of the screen when it needn't have been so intrustive.  Even looking past that there's a greater annoyance -- when the bonus scenes are accessed there's an annoying pause present, at least when played on my PS3.  Just enough of a pause that you'll find yourself highly annoyed and will probably want to turn off the bonus scene feature asap.Sadly, from a cursory glance at the menus, there doesn't seem to be a way to just play the bonus scenes.  Instead you must access them in place.  I could be missing something obvious there, but then again, if it was obvious I don't think I would have missed it.So, to summarize, there's a disappointing story (at least in the theatrical version) that doesn't get the best from the talent on hand, and an even more disappointing presentation of the bonus scenes that make the experience less satisfying than it should be.  Missed it by that much indeed.",3,62% more laughs if you can tolerate the annoying presentation,1226448000,"11 12, 2008",2008,2895,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'theatrical', 'version', 'film', 'twice', 'Once', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'run', 'again', 'now', 'Blu-ray', 'be', 'blunt', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'ok', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'run', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'enough', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'was', 'ok', 'book', 'felt', 'lacked', 'somewhat', 'least', 'when', 'compared', 'memories', 'original', 'TV', 'series.Ah', 'TV', 'series', 'Total', 'camp', 'fun', 'same', 'time', 'Loved', 'enough', 'viewers', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'target', 'mine', 'bigger', 'screen', 'especially', 'someone', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'lead', 'Carell', 'good', 'Maxwell', 'Smart', 'story', 'were', 'better', 'think', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'genuine', '5', 'star', 'hit', 'Unfortunately', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'here', 'missed', 'much', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'ok', 'taking', 'over', 'Barbara', 'Feldon', 'role', 'Alan', 'Arkin', ""n't"", 'bad', 'chief', 'Honestly', 'none', 'performances', 'are', 'disappointing', 'just', 'story', 'least', 'theatrical', 'version', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'should', 'be.Which', 'brings', 'back', '62', '%', 'more', 'laughs', 'are', 'promised', 'Blu-ray', 'Ah', 'more', 'laughs', 'promised', 'bonus', 'scenes', 'actually', 'good', 'enticed', 'give', 'Blu-ray', 'try', 'presentation', 'just', 'so', 'disappointing', 'have', 'got', 'slam', 'review.Offering', 'up', 'director', 'cut', 'extended', 'cut', 'version', 'film', 'something', 'greatly', 'appreciate', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'right', 'universe', 'please', 'do', 'way', 'viewer', 'not', 'done', 'here.Seamless', 'branching', 'been', 'DVD', 'format', 'while', 'used', 'here', ""n't"", 'even', 'close', 'being', 'seamless', 'Far', 'turn', 'bonus', 'scene', 'viewing', 'version', 'film', 'get', 'neat', 'little', 'icon', 'Maxwell', 'Smart', 'phone', 'booth', 'least', 'phone', 'booth', 'indicate', 'bonus', 'materials', 'are', 'now', 'being', 'shown', 'not', 'bad', 'icon', 'much', 'larger', 'be', 'part', 'screen', 'when', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'so', 'intrustive', 'Even', 'looking', 'greater', 'annoyance', 'when', 'bonus', 'scenes', 'are', 'accessed', 'annoying', 'pause', 'present', 'least', 'when', 'played', 'PS3', 'Just', 'enough', 'pause', ""'ll"", 'find', 'highly', 'annoyed', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'turn', 'off', 'bonus', 'scene', 'feature', 'asap.Sadly', 'cursory', 'glance', 'menus', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'way', 'just', 'play', 'bonus', 'scenes', 'Instead', 'must', 'access', 'place', 'could', 'be', 'missing', 'something', 'obvious', 'there', 'then', 'again', 'was', 'obvious', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'missed', 'it.So', 'summarize', 'disappointing', 'story', 'least', 'theatrical', 'version', ""n't"", 'get', 'best', 'talent', 'hand', 'even', 'more', 'disappointing', 'presentation', 'bonus', 'make', 'experience', 'less', 'satisfying', 'should', 'be', 'Missed', 'much', 'indeed']",Get Smart

It was Mel Brooks at his slapstick best, and the pairing of Don Adams with Barbra Feldman remains one of the more iconic pairings in TV history. The best thing about this filmatic adaptation is that he maintains the zany spirit of the original. That's due primarily to the comic capabilities of Steve Carell as the new Maxwell Smart.Carell, who has proved over and over that he shares the knack for comedy with folks like Steve Martin or Jim Carrey, provides the anchor for the films best moments. His deadpan delivery of clueless everyman is perfect for Max, who starts the film as the best details man in CONTROL, but wants more than anything else in the world to be a secret agent. When he finally passes the test, Chief (a spot on Alan Arkin) tells Max that he's SO good at details that the bureau can't let him out of the building.A chance snafu occurs that forces Max onto spy detail, and along with a deft Anne Hathaway as Agent 99, they go to bring done a plan by CHAOS to sell nukes. Globe-trotting silliness ensues, along with plenty of good jokes, physical comedy and nods to the original series. (Watch for the brief cameo with Mel Brooks, and Bill Murray as the hidden Agent 13.) While the pace is snappy and there is obviously a sequel baiting ending, there are a few things that would have made this a better film.Maxwell Smart, in the original, was not oafish or that aware of his ineptitude. In fact, it was is boisterous self-confidence that often made him get into problematic situations. ""Get Smart"" the movie didn't hit that target. Also, the political parody and bite in the TV series was always subtle, so a hamfisted 9/11 George Bush slam seemed both awkward and pointless, even while Ziegfried line about dead celebrities and their ""razor-sharp political advice"" almost made up for it. Should the inevitable sequel arrive, hopefully these things will be addressed.

1198107,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B001GMAVGE,trebe,"[2, 4]","As original ideas are hard to come by, it seems that eventually most every successful `classic' television series will be considered as the basis for a feature film.  With a history of rather abysmal results through the years, some who are actually familiar with the subject programs, have come to expect very little of such projects.  The world is decidedly different some forty years later, and the film version of Get Smart, retains little of the relevance, and even less of the charm or humor of the original series.  Like so many other big screen adaptations, the film attempts to capitalize on whatever cache may remain in a classic franchise, utilizing just a few threads from the TV series.  As the target audience for the film are those who may never have seen Don Adams as Agent 86, Barbara Feldon as Agent 99, Ed Platt as The Chief, and Bernie Kopell as Siegfried, this lack of connection was probably deemed irrelevant.By making Max and 99 strangers, the heart of what made the original Get Smart so special is removed.  Instead of a warm familiarity, the characters start coldly at ground zero.  Besides his height, Steve Carell bears few similarities to the original Maxwell Smart.  Anne Hathaway may be talented and charming, but the version of 99 she is given, has little in common with Feldon's character.  There are winks and nods to the past; 86's red Tiger Sunbeam convertible and shoe phone, Agent 13 (Bill Murray) in a tree, Fang the dog, and Bernie Kopell's cameo, to name a few, but they really don't make any substantial contribution to the story.  With a skeleton framework, and main characters that are mere shells of the original, this Get Smart is firmly targeted for today's audience.As such, the film isn't very funny, and only because of a strong finish, is it even a halfway decent action/adventure flick.  Up until the setting shifts to Los Angeles, Max and 99, clash and step on each other toes.  Perhaps the only bit in the entire film that is humorous is the dance number at the party, and there again the two leads are going against each other.  The Chief (Alan Arkin), and Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson) are mainly on the bench until they get to LA, where their contributions do help rescue Get Smart from forgettable oblivion.  The filmmakers consulted with series creators Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, but it apparently didn't help much.  One good decision was to play down the delivery of Max's classic lines.The film can also be viewed in a mode where alternate takes and versions are inserted, supposedly providing '62% more laughs'.  That stated improvement is not only hyperbole, but is false.  The alternate gags usually aren't funny, and instead of being a positive, these lame alternates just confirm how badly the writers were lost, groping for the right words.  What is really unfortunate is that the producers apparently fail to understand that reinserting the discarded material, does not cast the film or the filmmakers in a better light.  Instead they both seem rather pathetic, similar to watching a standup comedian bomb over and over again, with bad joke after bad joke.Now that the premise has been set, a sequel is probably being planned.  Siegfried can be retrieved from the drink, and he and Starker could be featured more prominently.  Hymie should be good to go.  In the 'sensitive' villain Dalip (Dalip Singh), they have their version of Jaws (from the Roger Moore Bonds), primed for the next adventure.  Jaws did a parachute stunt in Moonraker, so next perhaps Dalip on a cable car?  Hopefully now that Agents 86 and 99 have developed a relationship, the writers will do a better job, because there is really huge room for improvement.",2,another weak translation of a TV classic . . .,1251072000,"08 24, 2009",2009,3694,"['original', 'ideas', 'are', 'hard', 'come', 'eventually', 'most', 'successful', 'classic', 'television', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'considered', 'basis', 'feature', 'film', 'history', 'rather', 'abysmal', 'results', 'years', 'who', 'are', 'actually', 'familiar', 'subject', 'programs', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'very', 'little', 'such', 'projects', 'world', 'decidedly', 'different', 'forty', 'years', 'later', 'film', 'version', 'Get', 'Smart', 'little', 'relevance', 'even', 'less', 'charm', 'humor', 'original', 'series', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'big', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'film', 'attempts', 'capitalize', 'cache', 'may', 'remain', 'classic', 'franchise', 'utilizing', 'just', 'few', 'threads', 'TV', 'series', 'target', 'audience', 'film', 'are', 'who', 'may', 'never', 'have', 'seen', 'Don', 'Adams', 'Agent', '86', 'Barbara', 'Feldon', 'Agent', '99', 'Ed', 'Platt', 'Chief', 'Bernie', 'Kopell', 'Siegfried', 'lack', 'connection', 'was', 'probably', 'deemed', 'irrelevant.By', 'making', 'Max', '99', 'strangers', 'heart', 'what', 'made', 'original', 'Get', 'Smart', 'special', 'removed', 'Instead', 'warm', 'familiarity', 'characters', 'start', 'coldly', 'ground', 'zero', 'height', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'few', 'similarities', 'original', 'Maxwell', 'Smart', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'may', 'be', 'talented', 'charming', 'version', '99', 'given', 'little', 'common', 'Feldon', 'character', 'are', 'winks', 'nods', 'past', '86', 'red', 'Tiger', 'Sunbeam', 'convertible', 'shoe', 'phone', 'Agent', '13', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'tree', 'Fang', 'dog', 'Bernie', 'Kopell', 'cameo', 'name', 'few', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'substantial', 'contribution', 'story', 'skeleton', 'framework', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'mere', 'shells', 'original', 'Get', 'Smart', 'firmly', 'targeted', 'today', 'audience.As', 'such', 'film', ""n't"", 'very', 'funny', 'only', 'strong', 'finish', 'even', 'halfway', 'decent', 'action/adventure', 'flick', 'setting', 'shifts', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Max', '99', 'clash', 'step', 'other', 'toes', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'bit', 'entire', 'film', 'humorous', 'dance', 'number', 'party', 'there', 'again', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'going', 'other', 'Chief', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Agent', '23', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'are', 'mainly', 'bench', 'get', 'LA', 'where', 'contributions', 'do', 'help', 'rescue', 'Get', 'Smart', 'forgettable', 'oblivion', 'filmmakers', 'consulted', 'series', 'creators', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'much', 'One', 'good', 'decision', 'was', 'play', 'down', 'delivery', 'Max', 'classic', 'lines.The', 'film', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'viewed', 'mode', 'where', 'alternate', 'versions', 'are', 'inserted', 'supposedly', 'providing', ""'62"", '%', 'more', 'laughs', 'stated', 'improvement', 'not', 'only', 'hyperbole', 'false', 'alternate', 'gags', 'usually', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'instead', 'being', 'positive', 'lame', 'alternates', 'just', 'confirm', 'how', 'badly', 'writers', 'were', 'lost', 'groping', 'right', 'words', 'What', 'really', 'unfortunate', 'producers', 'apparently', 'fail', 'understand', 'reinserting', 'discarded', 'material', 'not', 'cast', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'better', 'light', 'Instead', 'seem', 'rather', 'pathetic', 'similar', 'watching', 'standup', 'comedian', 'bomb', 'over', 'again', 'bad', 'joke', 'bad', 'joke.Now', 'premise', 'been', 'set', 'sequel', 'probably', 'being', 'planned', 'Siegfried', 'can', 'be', 'retrieved', 'drink', 'Starker', 'could', 'be', 'featured', 'more', 'prominently', 'Hymie', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'go', ""'sensitive"", 'villain', 'Dalip', 'Dalip', 'Singh', 'have', 'version', 'Jaws', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'Bonds', 'primed', 'next', 'adventure', 'Jaws', 'did', 'parachute', 'stunt', 'Moonraker', 'so', 'next', 'perhaps', 'Dalip', 'cable', 'car', 'Hopefully', 'now', 'Agents', '86', '99', 'have', 'developed', 'relationship', 'writers', 'will', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'really', 'huge', 'room', 'improvement']",Get Smart

Don Adams as Maxwell Smart was the perfect combination between bumbling Mel Brooks-goofiness and high security intelligence.  There have been a lot of television shows that have been made into movies (and vice versa).  Many of these are terrible.  From much of the press at the time of the movies release, one might think that the film adaptation of GET SMART starring Steve Carrell is a disaster, but it's not.  Instead, the movie stays fairly close to the original series, especially in spirit.In the movie, Maxwell Smart has been working for CONTROL for a number of years and longs to be a field agent like his role model, Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson).  When CONTROL headquarters is attacked, it becomes clear that the organization has been infiltrated by KAOS and that someone is a traitor working for the other side.  Most of the field agents who weren't killed in the attack are pulled and given desk jobs and Max finally gets his promotion as he's assigned to the field as Agent 86.  He's partnered with Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway), who because of recent plastic surgery remains in the field since no one knows what she looks like now.  Before leaving for the field, Max is given some top secret gizmos from his two research and development friends Bruce (Masi Oka) and Lloyd (Nate Torrence).Carrell and Hathaway give fine performances. They are both talented actors and there really is some zany chemistry between them on screen.  Dwayne Johnson steals many of the scenes he is in playing up to while at the same time spoofing the macho leading man roles he often is given.Bill Murray has a very small cameo as Agent 13, so watch for that.

It was hilarious causing me to laugh out loud many times.  The humor was well thought out too, not simple potty humor.  Anne H. was beautiful in this film and the two of them complemented each other well.  I loved seeing the Rock in this movie albeit a lesser part.  He has always had the comical abilities as well.

1198117,A2ACBKYCO8OZKQ,B001GMAVGE,Working Man,"[1, 1]","As fan of the original Get Smart, I feel Steve Carell has done a good job as Maxwell Smart.  I think he's done Don Adams proud.  It's alway tough to tackle a role that is so closely associated to another, but Carell has done a good job.  I don't want to trash Steve Martin, but I feel he has turned the Pink Panther movies into just typical Steve Martin movie and that's not a bad thing, but he doesn't capture the role of Clouseau like Peter Sellers.  I make this comparison because I think Carell was a good fit for Smart and I was dissappointed.I know I may get some negative votes for my Martin comments, but it's not really meant to be a criticism because he's made the Pink Panther his own and has not copied Sellers.",5,Good Movie,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,723,"['fan', 'original', 'Get', 'Smart', 'feel', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'Maxwell', 'Smart', 'think', 'done', 'Don', 'Adams', 'proud', 'alway', 'tough', 'tackle', 'role', 'so', 'closely', 'associated', 'Carell', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'trash', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'feel', 'turned', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'movies', 'just', 'typical', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', ""n't"", 'capture', 'role', 'Clouseau', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'make', 'comparison', 'think', 'Carell', 'was', 'good', 'fit', 'Smart', 'was', 'dissappointed.I', 'know', 'may', 'get', 'negative', 'votes', 'Martin', 'comments', 'not', 'really', 'meant', 'be', 'criticism', 'made', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'own', 'not', 'copied', 'Sellers']",Get Smart
