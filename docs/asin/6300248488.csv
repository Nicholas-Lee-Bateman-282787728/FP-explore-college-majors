228511,A1DT6QY7WJWB3Z,6300248488,A. J. Palmer,"[126, 131]","Firstly let me point out that there is a DVD version of EOD, several actually. The best version is the latest released this year which is a wonderful transfer and includes a documentary on the film, Magnox and has clips of interviews and award ceremonies and discussions on the series. It is on region 2 DVD and is available from amazon uk. I too remember watching this masterpiece unfold when it was originally screened here in the uk. I was only 14 at the time and British television was still producing some wonderful stuff. Even so I knew this was something extra special. It must have planted a seed in my subconscious. Incredibly in 2003 it has lost none of its power and seems just as prescient now as ever. The callous disregard for the individual by corporations, the 'great game' played out between competing security agencies, the conspiracy of silence in the media. The ecology movement. The collusion of government with the malign constituents in our society. Ostensibly though this is still the 'little man's story' and what a central performance from the late great Bob Peck. His personal disintegration is harrowing to behold as he tries to unravel the mystery. Joe don Baker, what can you say about his performance. He is utterly compelling as the old school agency man fighting to keep his head above water. His verbal sparing matches with 'arts council' funded MI5's Ian McNeice and Charles Kay (also superb) are very very funny. Oh the script, what a script. Troy Kennedy Martin the writer provided the most consistently brilliant screenplay for television ever written. Martin Campbell the director sculpts it all into an entity that supplants the TV media. The DVD I saw previously to EOD was Leone's masterwork Once upon a time in America and I can honestly say EOD which bares many similarities is right up there alongside it.

228513,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,6300248488,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[18, 34]","This BBC series from the 1980s was created at a time of deep fear about nuclear power and nuclear bombs in Britain and fashionable left-wing anti-Americanism. This was the era of the Chernobyl disaster, the women protesting against stationing long-range missiles at U.S. bases in Britain and also deep suspicion about pollution from the Sellafield reprocessing plant on the shores of the North Sea.All these factors are reflected in this series which begins with the assassination of Emma Craven, the radical daughter of police inspector Craven right in front of his eyes. Bob Peck plays Craven, the officer who had earlier suffered the death of his wife from cancer and is now completely devastated by grief. He begins investigating the death of his daughter and finds she was a member of an environmental group which infiltrated a shadowy nuclear reprocessing plant to prove that there was illegal manufacturing of plutonium going on there.We meet the other main characters -- the weird British operative, his even weirder sidekick and weirdest of all Darius Jedburgh, a deranged CIA spy played with over-the-top gusto by Joe Don Baker. Jedburgh isn't so much a character as a caricature of what British lefties imagine Americans to be. While his performance is enjoyable, Peck is curiously flat as Craven -- not so much a man on a mission as a shadow of a man on a shadow of a mission.The first couple of episodes of this series are quite good but the plot gets nuttier and nuttier and harder and harder to understand. The filmmakers are anxious to deliver a statement about the threat to the planet represented by U.S. corporations and nukes -- but the statement is shrill and unconvincing.This series stands as a document of its time -- and of a particular left-wing attitude fairly pervasive in British elites.

In its day of 1985, I think it was a five star series.  Since then we've had a lot more series, especially from the BBC, and I personally think they have gone beyond this series.  For one, the device, where the father keeps seeing the ghost or semi-ghost of the daughter (we're not quite sure how much is his grief or imagination) has been used a tremendous amount since then.  The basic story of how the father tries to get to the bottom of his daughter's death, is pretty interesting.  She is murdered when she is returning home with him and it doesn't take long to find out she was an activist against some governmental activities.

228515,A9NCQGVV5W8N0,6300248488,"darklordzden ""darklordzden""","[5, 5]","Craigmills, Yorkshire, 1985: Ronald Craven (Bob Peck) is a detective with the West Yorkshire constabulary tasked with investigating allegations of corruption and ballot rigging within the infrastructure of the local miner's union. A widower who lives with his student activist daughter, Emma (Joanne Whalley), Craven finds himself confronted with the unthinkable when a shotgun-wielding assailant confronts him on the front lawn of his remote home and Emma is apparently 'accidentally' killed in the resultant carnage. A police manhunt is launched and as the grief-stricken Craven begins to make inquiries of his own, he inadvertently finds himself involved in a conspiracy that stretches from the corridors of Westminster to the stygian depths of 'Northmoor', a remote Nuclear waste storage facility on the Yorkshire dales, and which will take him far beyond the edge of darkness and into the hinterland where big business, corrupt government and state sanctioned execution walk hand in veiled hand.Make no bones about it, for a large swathe of the UK population, myself included, ""Edge Of Darkness"" is 'the' finest drama ever broadcast on British television and still the benchmark against which all others must be measured.Originally broadcast in the winter of 1985 at the height of the special relationship between Reagan and Thatcher, the Labour party's most militant incarnation, renewed violence in Northern Ireland, and at a time when the British public's dissatisfaction with the Conservative government's ruthless economic policies and relentless courting of multinational business interests had resulted in wide-spread suspicion and cynicism of the establishment, the series was a smash-hit ratings winner which was repeated almost immediately, swept the BAFTA awards (British Emmys) and made a house-hold name out of the late, lamented Bob Peck.Veteran screenwriter Troy Kennedy Martin's script, for my money, remains the most complex, nuanced, eloquent and haunting examination of a decent man caught up in the serpentine machinations of corporate power and closed government ever written. To label this series as merely a thriller alone is both erroneous and incorrect. It transcends the genre, incorporating elements of the political thriller, ghost story, vendetta movie, spy drama, western, film noir and magic realist literature, mythological fable, ecological treatise (James Lovelock's ""Gaia Hypothesis"" as set forth in his book,Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth, was clearly an influence), and all points in-between.Performances are, frankly, stunning. Bob Peck's turn as the stoic, slowly unraveling Ronald Craven is, to this day, one the finest pieces of screen acting that I have ever seen. You will never see a finer or more subtle depiction of a man who has been eviscerated by grief. His uncomprehending, hollow, dead-eyed stare will haunt you forever and the primal scream of sorrow and frustration which he gives rise to during his second confrontation with the man who killed his daughter is still one of the most chilling moments in television history. Matching Peck pound for pound is Texan actor Joe Don Baker, whose turn as the jovial, ambiguous CIA agent, Darius Jedburgh, provides some of the most memorable moments in the series: the revisionist ""show-down and soliloquy"" which occurs when Jedburgh confronts one of the series' principal antagonists at a conference in Gleneagles, Scotland, towards the close of the story, is still discussed in reverent tones in British drama and screen-writing circles to this day. Both actors are ably supported by a brilliant cast which features a smorgasbord of British acting talent including Ian McNeice, Zoe Wanamaker, Charles Kay, John Woodvine and Jack Watson.Apparently a big-screen remake of this series, featuring Mel Gibson, is currently in the offing. I can say, with absolutely no doubt in my mind, that it will never match the peerless brilliance and depth of the original. It is impossible to do justice to the complexity, elegance and eloquence of ""Edge Of Darkness"" in words - all I can recommend is that you rent or buy it, find a night when you are free and able to give yourself to it entirely, and truly enjoy the best of British.And if you, like I, find yourself haunted by Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen's haunting theme tune, ""Obituary"", you can find a superbly chilling live rendition of it on the live Clapton album,24 Nights.",5,Where The Black Flowers Bloom...,1255564800,"10 15, 2009",2009,4425,"['Craigmills', 'Yorkshire', '1985', 'Ronald',

228518,ADQU6C7DE6VD2,6300248488,J. Faulk,"[2, 2]","This refurbished issue looks fine, since the original was shot on film. If you find you're missing occasional dialog, turn on the Closed Captions.I watched all 6 episodes in one sitting. I was quickly struck by the masterful grip exhibited in every aspect of production. Many of the scenes were impressionistic rather than absolutely integral to the drama, but I felt like I was watching ""music."" This was true of Episodes 1 thru 4.Episodes 5 and 6 became a different matter, a shift in tone. #5, the break-in to the radioactive waste processing plant by Peck and Baker, occurs largely in dark underground tunnels (filmed in a Welsh mine), and makes for inky visuals. Here, as in the facility itself, the two men undergo great threat and have to scramble. Finally escaping, both are victims of lethal radiation poisoning. In #6, all the male characters, all their chicaneries and complex motives, jumble up before us, so Yours Truly didn't even bother to try to figure it out. The mini-series doesn't wrap up with a happy ending, of course. I suggest a 24-hour intermission before you go into Episodes 5 and 6.I got this DVD because of my interest in Bob Peck, who intrigued me as the android in the movie Slipstream. This fine actor died of cancer at age 53. It took me a while to recognize American actor Kenneth Nelson, of Boys in the Band fame, because he is wearing thick glasses in the role of Jerry Grogan, who seeks to acquire the processing facility. Nelson moved to England to work in a more enlightened theatrical environment, and at age 63 died of AIDS-related causes. I was galvanized by Tim McInnerny in the role of Terry Shields, the former repugnant boyfriend of Peck's murdered daughter. His projection of filthy nastiness rose from acting depths to be envied in the profession.The 90 minutes of Supplements, split between the two disks, are exceptional, and even include Closed Captions. There's much good archival footage on this much-awarded mini-series. Magnox: Secrets of The Edge of Darkness was made for this edition and we hear from surviving participants.

With those words, (and two bars of plutonium in his hands) yankee actor Joe Don Baker became one of the immortals of British television in this series which set the tone for edgy, paranoiac television years before the X-Files.  In this dark mini-series, Baker played free-lance CIA operative Darius Jedberg whose cowboy swagger and country can-do attitude has guaranteed him a role in every new James Bond flick.  The real star and hero is late actor Bob Peck as Yorkshire policeman Ronny Craven whose understated yet wrenching performance of a man coming apart provides a more subtle energy than Baker&#8217;s over-the top performance (see the box &#8211; the still of Peck with a gun in one hand and a teddy-bear in the other sums it up).  When Craven&#8217;s radical-environmentalist daughter is brutally gunned down, Craven follows clues that lead him to suspect sinister nuclear-age industrialists.  Seeking to uncover proof of a covert program to generate weapons-grade plutonium, and thinking that Craven&#8217;s daughter had been on the verge of uncovering the conspiracy when murdered, Jedburg hooks up with the british police officer who has slowly begun to disintegrate with grief.  Prodded but also steered by Thatcher-government functionaries with their own agendas, Peck and Baker form an uneasy alliance on collision course with a nuclear-age vionary.A superb work, with a pefectly edgy score by Eric Clapton.  I first caught the series in the late 80&#8217;s on PBS while Thatcher was still in office, and environmentalism was still something only radical lefties worried about.  There&#8217;s a pretty heavy allegory against nuclear energy &#8211; best typified by how Craven&#8217;s slow disintegration begins to mirror that of some raw and toxic isotope, radiating bits of itself away as it diminshes in halfs over a slow period of time.  But the story also excels because it rises above metaphors &#8211; the black flower that is meant to symbolize mother Earth&#8217;s revenge against the human infestation that has soiled the world isn&#8217;t a symbol at all, Jedberg says &#8211; he&#8217;s seen it in the killing fields of Afghanistan.  Though the story is centered on Craven, the Yorkshire cop plays straightman to Jedberg&#8217;s fall guy, with the two trading words about the end of the world, the environment and the lyrics to Willie Nelson songs.

What I got instead is a long and drawn out overly complicated and boring story.  The acting is good but this alone does not make a show  good.  I was tempted to stop watching in the middle of the series but was hoping for a big ending that would make up for the slow start.  It was not worth the wait.

228533,A1COQ2DOO1O9HD,6300248488,Wing J. Flanagan,"[13, 15]","Edge of Darkness, directed by Martin Campbell and written by Troy Kennedy-Martin, has the texture of a novel - the way a novel plays out in your mind as you read it.  This VHS presentation enhances that feeling, as the commercial breaks and credits of each episode are trimmed away, and the whole thing unreels in nearly six continuous hours.  Don't let the considerable investment in time frighten you.  This is some exquisite work.  To begin with, you will probably plan to watch it in &quot;chunks&quot;.  Don't.  Just clear the decks, because once you start watching, you will not be able to stop until the whole thing is done.The convoluted story does not so much develop as evolve through a series of stages.  To begin with, it is a murder mystery.  Then it becomes a political thriller.  Then a spy movie.  Next, an action piece.  Finally, it unwinds in an existential meditation on life and death.  Its politics are bit leftward-leaning, and there is a whole anti-nuke, &quot;environmental message&quot; thing ultimately worked in at the end, but the writing is skillful enough to rise above mere rhetoric and take Edge of Darkness into the realm of art.The performances by Bob Peck, Joanne Whalley, and a host of familiar BBC faces are uniformly excellent.  Even Joe Don Baker is good as the American CIA agent Darius Jedburgh (or &quot;Jed-borough&quot;, as a Scottish character calls him). As an American, I am always amused by the stereotypes other cultures have of us.  Viewed through British (or in director Martin Campbell's case, Australasian) eyes, Jedburgh becomes a roguish gunslinger in white, having apparently just stepped out of the same silver screen occupied by John Wayne and Randolph Scott. Baker is game, playing the &quot;cowboy&quot; angle to the hilt.  (He would later perform similar duty in the Campbell-directed James Bond film Goldeneye).  It is encouraging that he is ultimately a good guy, despite the &quot;taint&quot; of Reagan/Thatcher politics.The late Bob Peck is the real standout, though.  I cannot imagine anyone else playing the role of detective Ron Craven, whose shattering personal journey gives Edge of Darkness its soul.  His performance is completely authentic as he embodies a man who has lost everything, whose only reason for going on is to bring justice to those who murdered his daughter.  We have seen this sort of thing before, of course, but rarely realized with such verisimilitude.  We sense that if such things really happened as depicted in Edge of Darkness, they would happen pretty much they way they're shown.It's a shame that Peck was not better utilized in those big, slick, (though often hollow) films that we make in this country.  Most Americans will remember him, if they think of him at all, as the Australian hunter in Jurassic Park.  His big line, spoken just before becoming a velociraptor's lunch, was ""Clever girl!""  He managed to invest those two words with subtle shades of dread and admiration, as his character briefly contemplated the brutal speed with which his own mortality was upon him.Edge of Darkness will leave you feeling pretty much the same way.",5,Like reading a good novel,1002931200,"10 13, 2001",2001,3139,"['Edge', 'Darkness', 'directed', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'written', 'Troy', 'Kennedy-Martin', 'texture', 'novel', 'way', 'novel', 'out', 'mind', 'read', 'VHS', 'presentation', 'enhances', 'feeling', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'credits', 'episode', 'are', 'trimmed', 'away', 'whole', 'thing', 'unreels', 'nearly', 'six', 'continuous', 'hours', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'considerable', 'investment', 'time', 'frighten', 'exquisite', 'work', 'begin', 'will', 'probably', 'plan', 'watch', 'quot', 'chunks', 'quot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Just', 'clear', 'decks', 'once', 'start', 'watching', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'stop', 'whole', 'thing', 'done.The', 'convoluted', 'story', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'develop', 'evolve', 'series', 'stages', 'begin', 'murder', 'mystery', 'Then', 'political', 'thriller', 'Then', 'spy', 'movie', 'Next', 'action', 'piece', 'Finally', 'existential', 'meditation', 'life', 'death', 'politics', 'are', 'bit', 'leftward-leaning', 'whole', 'anti-nuke', 'quot', 'environmental', 'message', 'quot', 'thing', 'ultimately', 'worked', 'end', 'writing', 'skillful', 'enough', 'rise', 'mere', 'rhetoric', 'take', 'Edge', 'Darkness', 'realm', 'art.The', 'performances', 'Bob', 'Peck', 'Joanne', 'Whalley', 'host', 'familiar', 'BBC', 'are', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'Even', 'Joe', 'Don', 'Baker', 'good', 'American', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Darius', 'Jedburgh', 'quot', 'Jed-borough', 'quot', 'Scottish', 'character', 'American', 'am', 'always', 'amused', 'stereotypes', 'other', 'cultures', 'have', 'Viewed', 'British', 'director', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'case', 'Australasian', 'eyes', 'Jedburgh', 'roguish', 'gunslinger', 'white', 'having', 'apparently', 'just', 'stepped', 'same', 'silver', 'screen', 'occupied', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Randolph', 'Scott', 'Baker', 'game', 'playing', 'quot', 'cowboy', 'quot', 'angle', 'hilt', 'would', 'later', 'perform', 'similar', 'duty', 'Campbell-directed', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'Goldeneye', 'encouraging', 'ultimately', 'good', 'guy', 'quot', 'taint', 'quot', 'Reagan/Thatcher', 'politics.The', 'late', 'Bob', 'Peck', 'real', 'standout', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'role', 'detective', 'Ron', 'Craven', 'shattering', 'personal', 'journey', 'Edge', 'Darkness', 'soul', 'performance', 'completely', 'authentic', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'everything', 'only', 'reason', 'going', 'bring', 'justice', 'who', 'murdered', 'daughter', 'have', 'seen', 'sort', 'thing', 'course', 'rarely', 'realized', 'such', 'verisimilitude', 'sense', 'such', 'things', 'really', 'happened', 'depicted', 'Edge', 'Darkness', 'would', 'happen', 'pretty', 'much', 'way', ""'re"", 'shown.It', 'shame', 'Peck', 'was', 'not', 'better', 'utilized', 'big', 'slick', 'often', 'hollow', 'films', 'make', 'country', 'Most', 'Americans', 'will', 'remember', 'think', 'Australian', 'hunter', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'big', 'line', 'spoken', 'just', 'becoming', 'velociraptor', 'lunch', 'was', 'Clever', 'girl', 'managed', 'invest', 'two', 'words', 'subtle', 'shades', 'dread', 'admiration', 'character', 'briefly', 'contemplated', 'brutal', 'speed', 'own', 'mortality', 'was', 'him.Edge', 'Darkness', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'way']",Edge of Darkness VHS
