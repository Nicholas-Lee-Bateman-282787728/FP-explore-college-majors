This 2007 documentary on the legacy of Otis Redding was insightful, informative, and quite entertaining.  I was surprised it was done so well.  But, what bummed me out was there is NO clip of my absolute favorite Otis song, These Arms of Mine.In the earlier days of television, seeing your favorite performers was not like it is today.  It is rare that I ever got to see who Otis was or see him perform.  What I learned was that he couldn't dance.  I always thought all black people knew how to dance.  One of the interviewees is Zelma Redding, his wife who never remarried.  Otis had two children, and daughter speaks too, about her favorite Otis song, Love Man, and that he was loved by all, and loved all, and that he was an incredible man.Those interviewed speak highly of him, that he was energetic, innovative, dynamic, humble and grateful.  He wrote many of the songs on this documentary, and the most popular, Dock of the Bay, is here, although not a live performance.But, I was disappointed that one of the best was omitted, my favorite, These Arms of Mine.  .....Rizzo",5,"Well done, insightful, and musically entertaining",1314316800,"08 26, 2011",2011,1245,"['Generally', 'documentaries', 'are', 'not', 'done', 'well', 'surprisingly', 'interesting', 'full', 'song', 'clips', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'loved', '2007', 'documentary', 'legacy', 'Otis', 'Redding', 'was', 'insightful', 'informative', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'what', 'bummed', 'out', 'was', 'clip', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'Otis', 'song', 'Arms', 'Mine.In', 'earlier', 'days', 'television', 'seeing', 'favorite', 'performers', 'was', 'not', 'today', 'rare', 'ever', 'got', 'see', 'who', 'Otis', 'was', 'see', 'perform', 'What', 'learned', 'was', 'could', ""n't"", 'dance', 'always', 'thought', 'black', 'people', 'knew', 'how', 'dance', 'One', 'interviewees', 'Zelma', 'Redding', 'wife', 'who', 'never', 'remarried', 'Otis', 'had', 'two', 'children', 'daughter', 'speaks', 'too', 'favorite', 'Otis', 'song', 'Love', 'Man', 'was', 'loved', 'loved', 'was', 'incredible', 'man.Those', 'interviewed', 'speak', 'highly', 'was', 'energetic', 'innovative', 'dynamic', 'humble', 'grateful', 'wrote', 'many', 'songs', 'documentary', 'most', 'popular', 'Dock', 'Bay', 'here', 'not', 'live', 'performance.But', 'was', 'disappointed', 'one', 'best', 'was', 'omitted', 'favorite', 'Arms', 'Mine', '..Rizzo']",N/A

""brnn64""","[40, 40]","This is a DVD documetnary on a truly great artist done ABSOLUTELY RIGHT and as Otis would say in ""Hard to Handle""-yessiram!Unlike most docuemtaries of musicians, these guys undertsand that this is the DVD age where they are not limited by time for commercials so they put the films of Otis' sngs IN THEIR ENTIRETY balancing this with enough interview footage from those who really know him (no second-guessing talking head academics here). These combine to make this DVD a TEN-star winner.Surprisingly, no footage from Otis' classic 1966 appearance on the British TV show Ready Steady Go (which occasionally appeared on American Cable TV in the late 80s and was available on VHS for a brief spell) is included, but as magnificent as that was, it's hardly missed here since what we have is so excellent and The Big-O's likeable charisma shines through on even the lip-synchs. The songs from ""The!!!Beat"" (1966) in color, especially a rarely heard tune called ""Don't Mess With Cupid"" is loads of fun with our man dancing with some really sumptious soul sisters (hard to believe these women are probably now in their sixties!).The promotional clip of ""Tramp"" (minus Carla Thomas on film) is quite a hoot! Otis makes fun of his country image by bumbling around his farm in Macon with overalls and riding bareback on a donkey (that actually moves in time to the song). Then we see our hero transformed with a green suit to match the dollar bills that fall from his pockets (eerily, he also poses with the very plane that he lost his life in)! I recall one book saying that there is a lost TV clip of Otis and Carla doing a ""Black honeymooners"" routine to this song. That would be interesting to see.The last two clips of our humble hero performing ""Try a Little tenderness"" and ""Respect"" in Cleveland n the day before his death with the original Bar Kays (who also died on that plane crash). These guys really did perform as if it's their last day on earth and Otis' interjection of Areath Franklin's version of his famous tune will knock you out of your seat!The Redding Family, musicians Steve Cropper and Wayne Jackson, as well as Stax head honcho Jim Stewart make clear their affection for our man and what made him so special. After you see this wonderful DVD, you too will undertstand.

I, on the other hand, was trying to acclimate myself to new motherhood, living in NYC (from rural NJ) and trying to understand Elijah Mohammed's crusaders. Ours was a mixed marriage and I had a lot of new experiences to digest. Otis was not a priority -- back then.I thought he was a much older man -- for his voice carried a lifetime of experience in every note. Only when watching this bio-pic did I find out that he was only a year older than I was when he passed. Now that I'm a great-grandmother and at times in a mood to look back, I can only be in awe of this man. The artistry, humanity and (can I say it?) drug-free existence that was Otis Redding.... He was so much more than a singer.But -- more specific to the task at hand -- I must say that this is the best-best-best bio that I have ever seen.
