1444429,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B00570XV86,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[6, 6]","Millennium Dragon is about a young boy in modern day Japan who get dragged through time to the Heian period where he is told he is the only one who can save the peaceful nation from the dreaded Oni, monsters who fight with magic and kidnap children in their beds. Our young hero happens to be the only one who can control the powerful eight headed dragon who is the last hope for humanity. Millennium Dragon's story is told in a clumsy way, the phasing is very off and some parts which had needed time is rushed through and other parts drag on forever. The motivations of the characters are never that explored and I found myself getting bored which this movie quite often, which is quite a feat since I am a fanatic about dragon tales.In the middle of the story Millennium Dragon takes a twist which is a good one, and which do make the story allot deeper, but this twist is very clearly heavily inspired by Princess Mononoke and I constantly found myself wishing I was watching that movie instead. I do think that fans of Princess Mononoke will like Millennium Dragon, but be aware that Millennium Dragon is nowhere near as good.Now you might think that I hated Millennium Dragon from what I have been saying about it this far but that is not correct. Many of the characters are good, the visuals are stunning most of the time, even if they to suffer form a bit of the same hit and miss problem that plague the storyline. What I am trying to get at is that when Millennium Dragon is good, then is is really good, at those moments it is all you could want from an epic fantasy movie, however those amazing moments are sadly far between, most of the time though you can marvel at stunning visuals and animation.I watched this movie with the original Japanese voices and English dub, and I was not to impressed, all the voices are sort of flat and they sounded like someone who where reading text from a script in a studio. Satomi Ishihara who plays Mizuha is quite good but I did not care for the other`s delivery. I did not watch the English dub for more than a few moments, however I did notice that the English subs and the English dub did not match up so if you need subtitles due to some hearing problem that might be an issue, other than that I can not really comment on the dub. Music in this movie is ok but nothing that impressed me to much. The song that played during the credits where nice other than that the whole sound score, dubbing, sound effects and music for Millennium Dragon where just bland.One more problem that need to be addressed about this movie is that while the main characters are good, secondary characters pop up and vanish again before you learn enough about them to care, and even the main cast other than Jun do get to little screen time, which is a shame as I really wanted to learn more about some of these characters as they where on screen just long enough to seam interesting and then they are written out.Millennium Dragon is not bad, but it is not good either. I think that if they had worked more on the script they could have done so much more. The artwork is stunning and during the good scenes it made clear that the animation studio know what they are doing, but they drop the ball so many time and Millennium Dragon is left both boring and generic. If you are a huge fantasy or anime fan I think you will get enjoyment out of this movie, but if you are not a die hard fan then there are better movies out there to spend your money on.",3,Beautiful visuals but clumsy story,1339286400,"06 10, 2012",2012,3482,"['Millennium', 'Dragon', 'young', 'boy', 'modern', 'day', 'Japan', 'who', 'get', 'dragged', 'time', 'Heian', 'period', 'where', 'told', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'save', 'peaceful', 'nation', 'dreaded', 'Oni', 'monsters', 'who', 'fight', 'magic', 'kidnap', 'children', 'beds', 'young', 'hero', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'control', 'powerful', 'eight', 'headed', 'dragon', 'who', 'last', 'hope', 'humanity', 'Millennium', 'Dragon', 'story', 'told', 'clumsy', 'way', 'phasing', 'very', 'off', 'parts', 'had', 'needed', 'time', 'rushed', 'other', 'parts', 'drag', 'forever', 'motivations', 'characters', 'are', 'never', 'explored', 'found', 'getting', 'bored', 'movie', 'quite', 'often', 'quite', 'feat', 'am', 'fanatic', 'dragon', 'tales.In', 'middle', 'story', 'Millennium', 'Dragon', 'twist', 'good', 'one', 'do', 'make', 'story', 'allot', 'deeper', 'twist', 'very', 'clearly', 'heavily', 'inspired', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'constantly', 'found', 'wishing', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'instead', 'do', 'think', 'fans', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'will', 'like', 'Millennium', 'Dragon', 'be', 'aware', 'Millennium', 'Dragon', 'nowhere', 'near', 'good.Now', 'might', 'think', 'hated', 'Millennium', 'Dragon', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'saying', 'far', 'not', 'correct', 'Many', 'characters', 'are', 'good', 'visuals', 'are', 'stunning', 'most', 'time', 'even', 'suffer', 'form', 'bit', 'same', 'hit', 'miss', 'problem', 'storyline', 'What', 'am', 'trying', 'get', 'when', 'Millennium', 'Dragon', 'good', 'then', 'really', 'good', 'moments', 'could', 'want', 'epic', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'however', 'amazing', 'moments', 'are', 'sadly', 'far', 'most', 'time', 'can', 'marvel', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'animation.I', 'watched', 'movie', 'original', 'Japanese', 'voices', 'English', 'dub', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'voices', 'are', 'sort', 'flat', 'sounded', 'someone', 'who', 'where', 'reading', 'text', 'script', 'studio', 'Satomi', 'Ishihara', 'who', 'Mizuha', 'quite', 'good', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'other', 's', 'delivery', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'English', 'dub', 'more', 'few', 'moments', 'however', 'did', 'notice', 'English', 'subs', 'English', 'dub', 'did', 'not', 'match', 'up', 'so', 'need', 'subtitles', 'due', 'hearing', 'problem', 'might', 'be', 'issue', 'other', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'comment', 'dub', 'Music', 'movie', 'ok', 'nothing', 'impressed', 'much', 'song', 'played', 'credits', 'where', 'nice', 'other', 'whole', 'sound', 'score', 'dubbing', 'sound', 'effects', 'music', 'Millennium', 'Dragon', 'where', 'just', 'bland.One', 'more', 'problem', 'need', 'be', 'addressed', 'movie', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'good', 'secondary', 'characters', 'pop', 'up', 'vanish', 'again', 'learn', 'enough', 'care', 'even', 'main', 'cast', 'other', 'Jun', 'do', 'get', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'shame', 'really', 'wanted', 'learn', 'more', 'characters', 'where', 'screen', 'just', 'long', 'enough', 'seam', 'interesting', 'then', 'are', 'written', 'out.Millennium', 'Dragon', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'good', 'either', 'think', 'had', 'worked', 'more', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'artwork', 'stunning', 'good', 'scenes', 'made', 'clear', 'animation', 'studio', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'drop', 'ball', 'so', 'many', 'time', 'Millennium', 'Dragon', 'left', 'boring', 'generic', 'are', 'huge', 'fantasy', 'anime', 'fan', 'think', 'will', 'get', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'then', 'are', 'better', 'movies', 'there', 'spend', 'money']",Legend of the Millennium Dragon
1444430,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B00570XV86,DVD Verdict,"[2, 2]","Roman Martel, DVD Verdict --Legend of the Millennium Dragon is one of those anime movies that is really pretty to look at but lacking in the substance department. If you are familiar with the whole ""insecure young man is declared a savior and must overcome his fears to save the world"" storyline, the plot holds no surprises. Once Jun is introduced, you know how the whole thing is going to play out. Luckily, the movie does have something else going for it.The animation is impressive, specifically the backgrounds and battle scenes. The opening sequence with Gen'un and his men facing down the army of Oni is a perfect example. There is depth and detail in the surrounding countryside, the small village from which the Oni emerge, and the enormous statue of Buddha that forms the climax of the scene. The action is full of motion, from the rampaging Oni to the spear wielding foot soldiers. And the magic looks great; when Gen'un unleashes his powers, it's quite a sight.Sony's release is solid. We get a lovely picture 2.35:1/1080p high def image, showing off all the detail of the backgrounds, as well as colorful magic effects. The audio tracks comes in multiple flavors. I viewed the film with the Japanese DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio and it sounded excellent, balancing sound effects, dialogue, and music perfectly. The subtitles were easy to read and flowed well. A quick sample of the English dub was just as good. The lone extra is a concept art gallery which shows off much of the detail work that went into the backgrounds. We also get a standard def DVD copy of the film.-Full review at dvdverdict.com",4,The visuals are worth checking out.,1318204800,"10 10, 2011",2011,1610,"['Roman', 'Martel', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'Legend', 'Millennium', 'Dragon', 'one', 'anime', 'movies', 'really', 'pretty', 'look', 'lacking', 'substance', 'department', 'are', 'familiar', 'whole', 'insecure', 'young', 'man', 'declared', 'savior', 'must', 'overcome', 'fears', 'save', 'world', 'storyline', 'plot', 'surprises', 'Once', 'Jun', 'introduced', 'know', 'how', 'whole', 'thing', 'going', 'play', 'out', 'Luckily', 'movie', 'have', 'something', 'else', 'going', 'it.The', 'animation', 'impressive', 'specifically', 'backgrounds', 'battle', 'scenes', 'opening', 'sequence', ""Gen'un"", 'men', 'facing', 'down', 'army', 'Oni', 'perfect', 'example', 'depth', 'detail', 'surrounding', 'countryside', 'small', 'village', 'Oni', 'emerge', 'enormous', 'statue', 'Buddha', 'climax', 'scene', 'action', 'full', 'motion', 'rampaging', 'Oni', 'spear', 'wielding', 'foot', 'soldiers', 'magic', 'great', 'when', ""Gen'un"", 'powers', 'quite', 'sight.Sony', 'release', 'solid', 'get', 'lovely', 'picture', '2.35:1/1080p', 'high', 'def', 'image', 'showing', 'off', 'detail', 'backgrounds', 'as', 'well', 'colorful', 'magic', 'effects', 'audio', 'tracks', 'multiple', 'flavors', 'viewed', 'film', 'Japanese', 'DTS-HD', '5.1', 'Master', 'Audio', 'sounded', 'excellent', 'balancing', 'sound', 'effects', 'dialogue', 'music', 'perfectly', 'subtitles', 'were', 'easy', 'read', 'flowed', 'well', 'quick', 'sample', 'English', 'dub', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'lone', 'extra', 'concept', 'art', 'gallery', 'much', 'detail', 'work', 'went', 'backgrounds', 'also', 'get', 'standard', 'def', 'DVD', 'copy', 'film.-Full', 'review', 'dvdverdict.com']",Legend of the Millennium Dragon
1444431,AE5A9FB765HMF,B00570XV86,gex144,"[3, 6]","First off, I'm not a big fan of movies/shows that have out of control magic elements to them.  What I mean by ""out of control magic"" (OOCM) as opposed to ""in control"" (ICM) is that there are shows in which anything can happen, that the villain can become more powerful than everyone else just because the script says so, and the characters can pull off a deus ex machina for the same reasons.  Then there are the shows where the characters and villains are as strong as they are for reasons that are logical in the world the story is set in (shows such as this would be Avatar The Last Airbender, or Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood).  Legend of the Millennium Dragon, unfortunately, falls into the former.  So be warned that's the type of movie you will be seeing if you buy/rent it.That said, it wasn't the OOCM that gave the biggest hit to my rating for this movie (though that does automatically take it down at least 1/2*).  It was the fact that the characters weren't developed enough, or that we couldn't spend enough time with several (or even ALL) of the characters to care for them enough during the last 30 minutes of the movie.  The main person who truly takes a hit in this regard is Raiku (I hope that was his name), who is a character who doesn't seem to have a real reason for fighting, yet his past gives reason why he is the way he is, why he is fully of hate and vengeance at times.  It's just too bad his past was never fully expanded upon, or that we never spent enough time with his character because he is one of the most interesting characters in the entire movie.SPOILER ALERT!The story itself is interesting enough.  In the medieval past of Japan, an area of the country is at war with these ""demon"" like beings, which are powerful, but kill-able (though very difficult to kill).  Luckily, the normal people have a strong magician with them who is capable of killing off the most powerful of the demons with ease, which makes me wonder why he isn't at the front lines in the first place.  Seriously, the guy seemed pretty much invincible during the whole movie.  But anyway, the priest then travels through time, just because he can for whatever reason (so can at least one of the demons for I'm guessing similar reasons), and finds the boy he was looking for who was born with a dragon symbol on his chest which indicates he is the one destined to awake the Millennium Dragon to change the tide in the war and bring victory.  The boy is taken back to medieval times, makes friends with the people's side, eventually awakens the dragon, and helps fend off the next attack from the demons.  Eventually he takes one of the demons alive after discovering that they're not demons at all, but normal people in disguise (which begs the question of why they seem so supernaturally strong when they wear their suits, and why the hell they have real monsters with them, such as giant spiders).  In a nutshell, he finds out that the ""demon people"" have good reasons for fighting that are every bit as justified as the normal people.  It is then up to the main character Jun to figure out which side is more right then the other and decide which one he will help win with the power of the Millennium Dragon.It was a good story with poor execution.  It failed because it moved way too fast, even for a 2 hour movie.  If it were a 13 episode series, it would've been better paced, all the relevant characters would've been developed, the lore of the world would've been expanded upon, and maybe some of the plot holes would've disappeared.  But as it stands, it's way too rushed.  The animation is fairly good, the the character faces may make you second-guess the quality, depending on your preference.",3,Would've been better as a series.,1318723200,"10 16, 2011",2011,3716,"['First', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'movies/shows', 'have', 'control', 'magic', 'elements', 'What', 'mean', 'control', 'magic', 'OOCM', 'opposed', 'control', 'ICM', 'are', 'shows', 'anything', 'can', 'happen', 'villain', 'can', 'become', 'more', 'powerful', 'everyone', 'else', 'just', 'script', 'so', 'characters', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'same', 'reasons', 'Then', 'are', 'shows', 'where', 'characters', 'villains', 'are', 'as', 'strong', 'are', 'reasons', 'are', 'logical', 'world', 'story', 'set', 'shows', 'such', 'would', 'be', 'Avatar', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Alchemist', 'Brotherhood', 'Legend', 'Millennium', 'Dragon', 'unfortunately', 'former', 'So', 'be', 'warned', 'type', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'buy/rent', 'it.That', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'OOCM', 'gave', 'biggest', 'hit', 'rating', 'movie', 'automatically', 'take', 'down', 'least', '1/2*', 'was', 'fact', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'developed', 'enough', 'could', ""n't"", 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'several', 'even', 'characters', 'care', 'enough', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'main', 'person', 'who', 'truly', 'hit', 'regard', 'Raiku', 'hope', 'was', 'name', 'who', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'real', 'reason', 'fighting', 'yet', 'past', 'reason', 'why', 'way', 'why', 'fully', 'hate', 'vengeance', 'times', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'past', 'was', 'never', 'fully', 'expanded', 'upon', 'never', 'spent', 'enough', 'time', 'character', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'entire', 'movie.SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'story', 'interesting', 'enough', 'medieval', 'past', 'Japan', 'area', 'country', 'war', 'demon', 'beings', 'are', 'powerful', 'kill-able', 'very', 'difficult', 'kill', 'Luckily', 'normal', 'people', 'have', 'strong', 'magician', 'who', 'capable', 'killing', 'off', 'most', 'powerful', 'demons', 'ease', 'wonder', 'why', ""n't"", 'front', 'lines', 'first', 'place', 'Seriously', 'guy', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'much', 'invincible', 'whole', 'movie', 'anyway', 'priest', 'then', 'time', 'just', 'can', 'reason', 'so', 'can', 'least', 'one', 'demons', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'similar', 'reasons', 'boy', 'was', 'looking', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'dragon', 'symbol', 'chest', 'one', 'destined', 'awake', 'Millennium', 'Dragon', 'change', 'tide', 'war', 'bring', 'victory', 'boy', 'taken', 'back', 'medieval', 'times', 'friends', 'people', 'side', 'eventually', 'dragon', 'fend', 'next', 'attack', 'demons', 'Eventually', 'one', 'demons', 'alive', 'discovering', ""'re"", 'not', 'demons', 'normal', 'people', 'disguise', 'question', 'why', 'seem', 'so', 'supernaturally', 'strong', 'when', 'wear', 'suits', 'why', 'hell', 'have', 'real', 'monsters', 'such', 'giant', 'spiders', 'nutshell', 'out', 'demon', 'people', 'have', 'good', 'reasons', 'fighting', 'are', 'bit', 'as', 'justified', 'normal', 'people', 'then', 'up', 'main', 'character', 'Jun', 'figure', 'out', 'side', 'more', 'right', 'then', 'other', 'decide', 'one', 'will', 'help', 'win', 'power', 'Millennium', 'Dragon.It', 'was', 'good', 'story', 'poor', 'execution', 'failed', 'moved', 'way', 'too', 'fast', 'even', '2', 'hour', 'movie', 'were', '13', 'episode', 'series', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'paced', 'relevant', 'characters', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'developed', 'lore', 'world', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'expanded', 'maybe', 'plot', 'holes', 'would', ""'ve"", 'disappeared', 'way', 'too', 'rushed', 'animation', 'fairly', 'good', 'character', 'may', 'make', 'second-guess', 'quality', 'depending', 'preference']",Legend of the Millennium Dragon

1444433,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00570XV86,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 5]","It is surprising that they have released ""Legend of the Millennium Dragon"" (original title ""Onigamiden"" literally meaning ""Demon God Chronicle"") outside Japan. When the film was theatrically released in Japan back in April 2011, it was not a big hit (it missed the top 10 box office chart) and if I remember correctly, the film was not well-received. I saw it in Kyoto (where the film's story is set) and was not impressed because of the dull storytelling and rather some dated artworks, especially the character designs. I have seen it again on DVD and my opinion remains the same.The animated film follows the story of a timid 15-year-old middle school boy Jun Tendo, who is attacked by a strange creature while walking down the street of Kyoto. He runs into a nearby temple for shelter, where he meets a mysterious monk called Gen'un. Gen'un seems to possess special powers and Jun is whisked to the ancient city of Kyoto of the Heian era (794-1185), where humans are fighting fierce battles against the ""oni""s or ""demons.""The story (based on the novel by Takahumi Takada) looks like an amalgamation of two Hayao Miyazaki films - ""Spirited Away"" and ""Princess Mononoke"" - but without Miyazaki's compelling narrative and memorable characters. The background drawings of ""Legend of the Millennium Dragon"" are fine (including the locations of the modern-day Kyoto) and so is the design of the ""orochi"" (or a dragon) by Katsuhiro Otomo, but everything else is uninspired. The story is told in a dull way. Principal characters are lackluster. Most secondary characters are forgettable. Perhaps most disappointingly, those characters' designs (faces in particular) look dated.Not a terrible film, I admit, but still ""Legend of the Millennium Dragon"" lacks creative edge and imagination.",2,Some Good Visuals Ruined by Dull Storytelling,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,1783,"['surprising', 'have', 'released', 'Legend', 'Millennium', 'Dragon', 'original', 'title', 'Onigamiden', 'literally', 'meaning', 'Demon', 'God', 'Chronicle', 'Japan', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'theatrically', 'released', 'Japan', 'back', 'April', '2011', 'was', 'not', 'big', 'hit', 'missed', 'top', '10', 'box', 'office', 'chart', 'remember', 'correctly', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'well-received', 'saw', 'Kyoto', 'where', 'film', 'story', 'set', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'dull', 'storytelling', 'rather', 'dated', 'artworks', 'especially', 'character', 'designs', 'have', 'seen', 'again', 'DVD', 'opinion', 'same.The', 'animated', 'film', 'story', 'timid', '15-year-old', 'middle', 'school', 'boy', 'Jun', 'Tendo', 'who', 'attacked', 'strange', 'creature', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'Kyoto', 'nearby', 'temple', 'shelter', 'where', 'mysterious', 'monk', 'called', ""Gen'un"", ""Gen'un"", 'possess', 'special', 'powers', 'Jun', 'whisked', 'ancient', 'city', 'Kyoto', 'Heian', 'era', '794-1185', 'where', 'humans', 'are', 'fighting', 'fierce', 'battles', 'oni', 's', 'demons', 'story', 'based', 'novel', 'Takahumi', 'Takada', 'amalgamation', 'two', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'films', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'Miyazaki', 'compelling', 'narrative', 'memorable', 'characters', 'background', 'drawings', 'Legend', 'Millennium', 'Dragon', 'are', 'fine', 'including', 'locations', 'modern-day', 'Kyoto', 'so', 'design', 'orochi', 'dragon', 'Katsuhiro', 'Otomo', 'everything', 'else', 'uninspired', 'story', 'told', 'dull', 'way', 'Principal', 'characters', 'are', 'lackluster', 'Most', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'forgettable', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'disappointingly', 'characters', 'designs', 'particular', 'look', 'terrible', 'film', 'admit', 'still', 'Legend', 'Millennium', 'Dragon', 'creative', 'edge', 'imagination']",Legend of the Millennium Dragon
