1043885,A921ZNMJ603WF,B000M7FOO8,Andrew M. Williams,"[0, 1]","I enjoyed this movie.There were a couple of things that I didn't like about it,but there were a lot more things about it that I did like.I didn't like Willie Nelson playing Jessie Duke(again).He played Jessie as a drugged out dirty joke telling drunk,and Uncle Jessie was none of the above(we did see him drinking moonshine and losing his temper on the original show from time to time,but he was always a gentleman to the core.).I thought that Roscoe Coltrane was nowhere as enjoyable as in the t.v. series.In the series,Roscoe may have been a bumbling,ineffective sherrif,but he was never a paranoid schitzophrenic like in this version.I did like Chris MacDonald as Boss Hog and I especially enjoyed April Scott as Daisy Duke.She is definately much prettier and sexier than Jessica Simpson.A real class act by comparrison,although Cathy Bach will always be my favorite as Daisy,I hope that April will come back and play Daisy in any future sequels.This movie is far better than the 2005 version which was a real stinker no matter how you look at it-a real piece of crap.Of course,the real star of the show,what makes any Dukes of Hazzard show watchable,is that 4000 pound hunk of steel and plastic known as a 1969 Dodge Charger-better known as the General Lee.I understand that when the original Dukes of Hazzard t.v. show was on,the car actually received more fan mail than the actors!!The General Lee Lives!",3,The General Lee Lives!,1178841600,"05 11, 2007",2007,1410,"['enjoyed', 'movie.There', 'were', 'couple', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'were', 'lot', 'more', 'things', 'did', 'like.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'playing', 'Jessie', 'Duke', 'again', '.He', 'played', 'Jessie', 'drugged', 'out', 'dirty', 'joke', 'telling', 'drunk', 'Uncle', 'Jessie', 'was', 'none', 'above', 'did', 'see', 'drinking', 'moonshine', 'losing', 'temper', 'original', 'show', 'time', 'time', 'was', 'always', 'gentleman', 'core', '.I', 'thought', 'Roscoe', 'Coltrane', 'was', 'nowhere', 'as', 'enjoyable', 't.v', 'series.In', 'series', 'Roscoe', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'bumbling', 'ineffective', 'sherrif', 'was', 'never', 'paranoid', 'schitzophrenic', 'version.I', 'did', 'Chris', 'MacDonald', 'Boss', 'Hog', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'April', 'Scott', 'Daisy', 'Duke.She', 'definately', 'much', 'prettier', 'sexier', 'Jessica', 'Simpson.A', 'real', 'class', 'act', 'comparrison', 'Cathy', 'Bach', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'favorite', 'Daisy', 'hope', 'April', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'play', 'Daisy', 'future', 'sequels.This', 'movie', 'far', 'better', '2005', 'version', 'was', 'real', 'stinker', 'matter', 'how', 'look', 'it-a', 'real', 'piece', 'crap.Of', 'course', 'real', 'star', 'show', 'what', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'show', 'watchable', '4000', 'pound', 'hunk', 'steel', 'plastic', 'known', '1969', 'Dodge', 'Charger-better', 'known', 'General', 'Lee.I', 'understand', 'when', 'original', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 't.v', 'show', 'was', 'car', 'actually', 'received', 'more', 'fan', 'mail', 'actors', 'General', 'Lee']",The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning

Country legend Willie Nelson reprises his role of Uncle Jesse Duke that he first played in the 2005 theatrical film who runs the Dukes' farm.

Granted it was better than the  movie version with johnny knotsville and that other guy. it was actually kind of watchable but it still sucked. the actors  were  better but still missed the mark the actress playing daisy duke was excellent, quite cute. but the main characters jesse, bo, luke , boss hogg really guys come on whoever is in charge of the casting of this film should be shot!  the characters are'nt really believeable expect for the actress playing daisy was good choice on their part. i don't care if  Waylon Jennings was friends with Willie Nelson so that producers of the two very flawed film versions of the dukes said why not use Willie ? He was Jennings friend and  an american icon granted he pull it off ok,  but they could've done a better search and found an unknown for jesse. same go for Boss Hogg: Christopher McDonald? he's better than Bert Reynolds. But the  main thing i have a problem with is, the crappy lame script that is littered with crude sexual  themes. the person that wrote this piece of junk really deserves a  hard spanking on his or her behind, this ain't a porky film. you sick puppies this is wholesome family series that is iconic as americian as apple pie that you've turned into a sleazy turd of film not honoring. but disgracing the series entirely you have missed the mark. it also makes bo and luke out to be hornytoads something which they never were, they were clean cut  and smart. Harland Williams was a good choice, he needed to work on accent little more that's all. umm Cooter well he's no Ben Jones i thought they had hired Tom Green for a bit ewww, but the guy was ok.

1043890,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000M7FOO8,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[7, 8]","Surely, there must be a way for all of us fans of the real Dukes of Hazzard to get together and stop Hollywood from making these stupid movies that spit upon the traditions of the television series.  Maybe you're wondering why I would even bother to watch this straight-to-DVD ""prequel.""  Well, I'll tell you - I just had to see if it could possibly be even worse than the first movie (and, uh, April Scott was looking mighty fine on the DVD cover).  Much to my surprise, I think this film might actually be a smidgen better than the first one.  That's not to say that this one doesn't stink like all the manure on Uncle Jessie's farm, though, because it does.  It did make me laugh a time or two, though, so I think I'm being rather generous in giving the film two stars.Apart from Willie Nelson, this film sports an all-new cast, with Jonathan Bennett and Randy Wayne taking on the roles of Bo and Luke, respectively.  Both cousins, who haven't seen each other in several years, are sent to work on Uncle Jessie's farm in order to keep them out of trouble (Luke's a pyromaniac and Bo's an all-around menace to society).  Daisy (April Scott) is also there, but she surely isn't the Daisy I was expecting.  This Daisy is a good girl who dresses in frumpy clothes, does basically nothing with her hair, and can't get any man to notice her (except for hall monitor Enos).  The movie's halfway over before she transforms herself and breaks out the Daisy Dukes I know I was looking for.  Even then, she's no Catherine Bach, but she's certainly prettier - and a much better actress - than Jessica Simpson.  Christopher McDonald plays this younger version of Boss Hogg.  He's certainly a step up from Burt Reynolds, but why in the world they go out and get a tall, lanky guy to fill the definitive shoes of the short and stocky Sorrell Booke is still a mystery to me.  James Best will always be the one and only Rosco, but I guess Harland Williams does OK in the role, especially for a comedian turned actor.  Finally, the filmmakers apparently didn't appreciate Ben Jones, the real Cooter, telling fans not to watch the first movie because they turn Cooter into a complete idiot in this movie.Basically, this film supposedly shows us the origin of the Duke Boys.  Uncle Jessie and Boss Hogg are actually buddies at the start, but these fellow moonshiners part ways when Boss Hogg demands a bigger cut of Uncle Jessie's business.  The Duke farm is soon on the line as Boss Hogg declares Hazzard a dry county and sics Roscoe on all of the moonshiners in the area (especially the Dukes).  Bo and Luke volunteer to distribute the moonshine - but first, they need a fast car (enter the General Lee).  Daisy wants to help out by getting a job at the Boar's Nest, but first she has to stop dressing like a schoolmarm and come up with a new, sexy look.  From that point on, it's just a matter of getting through a bunch of stupid plot points and shenanigans on the way to the most predictable of endings.Let me also say a few words about the women in this movie.  Hazzard County is supposedly in North Carolina, the state I've lived in all of my life, and I just have to say that (apart from April Scott) the women in this film, especially the peroxide blondes Bo and Luke keep chasing, can't hold a candle to the true Southern girls of North Carolina.  Carolina girls are the best in the world, but you wouldn't know it from watching this film.I for one hope the Dukes of Hazzard movies will stop at two.  Neither of them have been loyal to the spirit of the show, especially when it comes to Uncle Jessie, and there are plenty of other dumb scripts floating around out there in La-La Land full of the same dumb jokes and toilet humor you'll find here.",2,Better than the first movie -- but that's not saying much,1184630400,"07 17, 2007",2007,3740,"['Surely', 'must', 'be', 'way', 'fans', 'real', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'get', 'together', 'stop', 'Hollywood', 'making', 'stupid', 'movies', 'spit', 'traditions', 'television', 'series', 'Maybe', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'why', 'would', 'even', 'bother', 'watch', 'straight-to-DVD', 'prequel', 'Well', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'just', 'had', 'see', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'even', 'worse', 'first', 'movie', 'uh', 'April', 'Scott', 'was', 'looking', 'mighty', 'fine', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Much', 'surprise', 'think', 'film', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'smidgen', 'better', 'first', 'one', 'not', 'say', 'one', ""n't"", 'stink', 'manure', 'Uncle', 'Jessie', 'farm', 'though', 'did', 'make', 'time', 'two', 'though', 'think', ""'m"", 'being', 'rather', 'generous', 'giving', 'film', 'two', 'stars.Apart', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'film', 'sports', 'all-new', 'cast', 'Jonathan', 'Bennett', 'Randy', 'Wayne', 'taking', 'roles', 'Bo', 'Luke', 'respectively', 'cousins', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'several', 'years', 'are', 'sent', 'work', 'Uncle', 'Jessie', 'farm', 'order', 'keep', 'trouble', 'Luke', 'pyromaniac', 'Bo', 'all-around', 'menace', 'society', 'Daisy', 'April', 'Scott', 'also', 'there', 'surely', ""n't"", 'Daisy', 'was', 'expecting', 'Daisy', 'good', 'girl', 'who', 'frumpy', 'clothes', 'basically', 'nothing', 'hair', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'man', 'notice', 'hall', 'monitor', 'Enos', 'movie', 'halfway', 'breaks', 'out', 'Daisy', 'Dukes', 'know', 'was', 'looking', 'Even', 'then', 'Catherine', 'Bach', 'certainly', 'prettier', 'much', 'better', 'actress', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'Christopher', 'McDonald', 'younger', 'version', 'Boss', 'Hogg', 'certainly', 'step', 'up', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'why', 'world', 'go', 'out', 'get', 'tall', 'lanky', 'guy', 'fill', 'definitive', 'shoes', 'short', 'stocky', 'Sorrell', 'Booke', 'still', 'mystery', 'James', 'Best', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'one', 'only', 'Rosco', 'guess', 'Harland', 'Williams', 'OK', 'role', 'especially', 'comedian', 'turned', 'actor', 'Finally', 'filmmakers', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'Ben', 'Jones', 'real', 'Cooter', 'telling', 'fans', 'not', 'watch', 'first', 'movie', 'turn', 'Cooter', 'complete', 'idiot', 'movie.Basically', 'film', 'supposedly', 'origin', 'Duke', 'Boys', 'Uncle', 'Jessie', 'Boss', 'Hogg', 'are', 'actually', 'buddies', 'start', 'fellow', 'moonshiners', 'part', 'ways', 'when', 'Boss', 'Hogg', 'bigger', 'cut', 'Uncle', 'Jessie', 'business', 'Duke', 'farm', 'soon', 'line', 'Boss', 'Hogg', 'Hazzard', 'dry', 'county', 'sics', 'Roscoe', 'moonshiners', 'area', 'especially', 'Dukes', 'Bo', 'Luke', 'volunteer', 'distribute', 'moonshine', 'first', 'need', 'fast', 'car', 'enter', 'General', 'Lee', 'Daisy', 'help', 'out', 'getting', 'job', 'Boar', 'Nest', 'first', 'stop', 'dressing', 'schoolmarm', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'sexy', 'look', 'point', 'just', 'matter', 'getting', 'bunch', 'stupid', 'plot', 'points', 'shenanigans', 'way', 'most', 'predictable', 'endings.Let', 'also', 'say', 'few', 'words', 'women', 'movie', 'Hazzard', 'County', 'supposedly', 'North', 'Carolina', 'state', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'life', 'just', 'have', 'say', 'apart', 'April', 'Scott', 'women', 'film', 'especially', 'peroxide', 'Bo', 'Luke', 'keep', 'chasing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'true', 'Southern', 'girls', 'North', 'Carolina', 'Carolina', 'girls', 'are', 'best', 'world', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'watching', 'film.I', 'one', 'hope', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'movies', 'will', 'stop', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'loyal', 'spirit', 'show', 'especially', 'when', 'Uncle', 'Jessie', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'dumb', 'scripts', 'floating', 'around', 'there', 'La-La', 'Land', 'full', 'same', 'dumb', 'jokes', 'toilet', 'humor', ""'ll"", 'find', 'here']",The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning

1043901,AKNRTZQ4XS8NC,B000M7FOO8,Matt Chase,"[31, 31]","I watched the DVD of this last night, and I've been mulling over my feelings about it today, on and off.  I feel a bit split down the middle about it. Ok, my initial reactions when viewing this was that it was a travesty, in Hazzard terms. The main thing that's wrong with it is the change in tone of the attitudes and depiction of *some* of the characters. Bo and Luke were always clean cut well meaning boys. They may not have been mensa candidates, but they had their smarts. The problem with this film and the previous film is that they are depicted almost like morons. I thought the casting of the two leads was ok though, better than the previous movie. The next problem is Uncle Jesse. Willie Nelson looks the part and is an OK substitute for Denver Pyle, but that's it. The fact that he isn't an actor really shows and he's patently unable to embelish the character with any of the warmth that Denver brought. Uncle Jesse never told any crude jokes in the original series either. It really lowers the tone, if you have to have crude jokes and swearing at least limit it to just Bo and Luke, leave Uncle Jesse out of it. Uncle Jesse was the heart and soul of the Dukes Of Hazzard, he was the Obi-Wan of the series.Right on to the other cast members, I thought they were OK, you're never going to find replacements for Sorrell Booke and James Best, but I thought Christopher Macdonald did quite a good job of Boss, better than Burt Reynolds anyhow. The actor that played Rosco was an interesting choice, OK I suppose, but no James Best. The girl that played Daisy, she was a bit on the thin side, but I still would.Apart from the crudeness and some of the jokes I thought the story line was OK. It still felt like the Dukes of Hazzard in this sense. SO despite these misgivings, I wouldn't mind seeing another film with this cast.I'm not a prude by any stretch, and  I like films like Animal House and Porkys or American Pie. It's just watching that kind of humor transplanted into a beloved family franchise like this is a bitter pill to swallow.3 stars for being an improvement on the last film, but must try harder for the next.",3,Trying to be objective,1174003200,"03 16, 2007",2007,2137,"['watched', 'DVD', 'last', 'night', ""'ve"", 'been', 'mulling', 'feelings', 'today', 'feel', 'bit', 'split', 'middle', 'Ok', 'initial', 'reactions', 'when', 'viewing', 'was', 'was', 'travesty', 'Hazzard', 'terms', 'main', 'thing', 'wrong', 'change', 'tone', 'attitudes', 'depiction', '*some*', 'characters', 'Bo', 'Luke', 'were', 'always', 'clean', 'cut', 'well', 'meaning', 'boys', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'mensa', 'candidates', 'had', 'smarts', 'problem', 'film', 'previous', 'film', 'are', 'depicted', 'almost', 'morons', 'thought', 'casting', 'two', 'leads', 'was', 'ok', 'better', 'previous', 'movie', 'next', 'problem', 'Uncle', 'Jesse', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'part', 'OK', 'substitute', 'Denver', 'Pyle', 'fact', ""n't"", 'actor', 'really', 'patently', 'unable', 'embelish', 'character', 'warmth', 'Denver', 'brought', 'Uncle', 'Jesse', 'never', 'told', 'crude', 'jokes', 'original', 'series', 'either', 'really', 'tone', 'have', 'have', 'crude', 'jokes', 'swearing', 'least', 'limit', 'just', 'Bo', 'Luke', 'leave', 'Uncle', 'Jesse', 'Uncle', 'Jesse', 'was', 'heart', 'soul', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'was', 'Obi-Wan', 'series.Right', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'thought', 'were', 'OK', ""'re"", 'never', 'going', 'find', 'replacements', 'Sorrell', 'Booke', 'James', 'Best', 'thought', 'Christopher', 'Macdonald', 'did', 'quite', 'good', 'job', 'Boss', 'better', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'anyhow', 'actor', 'played', 'Rosco', 'was', 'interesting', 'choice', 'OK', 'suppose', 'James', 'Best', 'girl', 'played', 'Daisy', 'was', 'bit', 'thin', 'side', 'still', 'would.Apart', 'crudeness', 'jokes', 'thought', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'OK', 'still', 'felt', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'sense', 'misgivings', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'film', 'cast.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'prude', 'stretch', 'like', 'films', 'Animal', 'House', 'Porkys', 'American', 'Pie', 'just', 'watching', 'kind', 'humor', 'transplanted', 'beloved', 'family', 'franchise', 'bitter', 'pill', 'swallow.3', 'stars', 'being', 'improvement', 'last', 'film', 'must', 'try', 'harder', 'next']",The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning

This film is a prequel which explains how the Duke clan got their start as fast-driving moonshiners. The casting is interesting, with Willie Nelson cast as a stoned Uncle Jesse, the family patriarch and moonshiner-in-chief. In all seriousness Willie should stick to singing. Perhaps his infamous IRS bill makes him take work he otherwise would refuse. I hope that's the reason he's here, anyway.Bo and Luke Duke (Jonathan Bennett and Randy Wayne) are largely satisfactory here, if a bit denser and more slapstick than necessary (the scenes in drag are rather painful), while Harland Williams as Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane was a rather bizarre choice: he's a naturally funny guy, but his ad libs border on the otherworldly (""Did that manatee just swallow that cabbage whole?"" was one that made it into the extras, for instance). Christopher McDonald does a decent job as Boss Hogg, while rest of the cast is mediocre at best.The plot runs along as you would expect it would, with lots of uninspiring car chases in the General Lee, lots of bad double entendre, and subplots about an illegal ice cream facility and a pig (""Dainty"") on a corrugated metal roof (which alternated between a live pig, a rubber pig, and a very hokey animatronic stunt pig, which talks in the extras). The extras are more interesting than the film, and include the birth of the General Lee, the tales of Dainty the pig, the story of Daisy Duke (which is way less interesting that you would expect), and a music video which features a country-rap hybrid about the Duke boys.

I felt it was incosistent with the original Dukes who were more like Robin hood than just rowdy moonshiners, and this movie doen't do much to that. The acting is horrible, and I can't believe Willie Nelson signed on for this one.  I thought at times this might have a glimmer of the original series, such as the boys actually messing around with Rosco than Rosco being a Hard edged sherrif, but then it would loose it again in bad script and acting.  Rent if you must, but just not a great movie.",2,"I don't really know what to say that hasn't already been said, just not great",1173830400,"03 14, 2007",2007,532,"['2005', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'felt', 'was', 'incosistent', 'original', 'Dukes', 'who', 'were', 'more', 'like', 'Robin', 'hood', 'just', 'rowdy', 'moonshiners', 'movie', 'doe', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'acting', 'horrible', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'signed', 'one', 'thought', 'times', 'might', 'have', 'glimmer', 'original', 'series', 'such', 'boys', 'actually', 'messing', 'Rosco', 'Rosco', 'being', 'Hard', 'edged', 'sherrif', 'then', 'would', 'loose', 'again', 'bad', 'script', 'acting', 'Rent', 'must', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'movie']",The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning
