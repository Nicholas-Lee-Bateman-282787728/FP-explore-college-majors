Mercy Mission is actually based on a true story and as you watch you will become immersed into the real life drama.  Robert Loggia gives a powerful performance and the story focuses on the human spirit and lessons learned rather than technology and special effects.  The other movie on the disc, Nowehere to Land, is more like the traditional disaster movie but the acting of Jack Wagner and the intricate storyline make this one just as equally pleasing to watch. So, make sure that your tray tables are closed and in their upright position and get ready to watch some riveting ""air"" drama movies.",4,Flight Time,1219449600,"08 23, 2008",2008,763,"['DVD', 'duo', 'shares', 'common', 'framework', 'AIRPLANES', 'many', 'predecessors', 'not', 'merely', 'focus', 'traditional', 'disaster', 'airport', 'prototype', 'Mercy', 'Mission', 'actually', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'watch', 'will', 'become', 'immersed', 'real', 'life', 'drama', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'powerful', 'performance', 'story', 'human', 'spirit', 'lessons', 'learned', 'rather', 'technology', 'special', 'effects', 'other', 'movie', 'disc', 'Nowehere', 'Land', 'more', 'traditional', 'disaster', 'movie', 'acting', 'Jack', 'Wagner', 'intricate', 'storyline', 'make', 'one', 'just', 'equally', 'pleasing', 'watch', 'So', 'make', 'sure', 'tray', 'tables', 'are', 'closed', 'upright', 'position', 'get', 'ready', 'watch', 'riveting', 'air', 'drama', 'movies']",Mercy Mission/Nowhere to Land

1083517,A2NLIB986TEESZ,B000ROAMCK,L. M Young,"[1, 1]","Please note that I am only reviewing this DVD for the film MERCY MISSION. I have been wanting this movie on professional DVD for some years now, having relied on a VHS copy for so many years. This has been a Christmas favorite at our home since it was broadcast on NBC. However, don't worry, it doesn't contain cute elves, warm Santas, or bathotic family reunions; it just takes place at Christmas.Jay Parkins is a young pilot to whom flying takes first place, even to his responsibilities at home and his pregnant wife. After he's fired from a job for deliberately annoying the client, he and a fellow pilot agree to fly two crop dusting planes to Norfolk Island, deep in the Pacific Ocean. The plane his friend is flying malfunctions as they leave Pago Pago, but Jay continues, knowing he will need the fee for ferrying the plane when his son is born. Unfortunately his navigation equipment fouls, leaving him with no idea where he is, alone with the vast Pacific below. A nearby Air New Zealand commercial flight offers to help find him.If this all sounds tedious, it isn't. Scott Bakula as Parkins and Robert Loggia as senior Air New Zealand pilot Gordon Vette brilliantly carry this tense film, as Vette uses all his aviation wiles to locate Parkins' tiny plane, and both men form an emotional bond via anxious radio calls. Supporting characters such as Vette's cockpit crew, the head stewardess, Parkins' flying partner, and a planeful of New Zealanders returning from holiday all enhance the story and the tension until the gripping conclusion. If you like good character pieces this film is highly recommended; aviation buffs will probably love it, too.",5,"A Small Plane, A Large Ocean, and a Determined Pilot",1298851200,"02 28, 2011",2011,1661,"['Please', 'note', 'am', 'only', 'reviewing', 'DVD', 'film', 'MERCY', 'MISSION', 'have', 'been', 'wanting', 'movie', 'professional', 'DVD', 'years', 'now', 'having', 'relied', 'VHS', 'copy', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'been', 'Christmas', 'favorite', 'home', 'was', 'broadcast', 'NBC', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""n't"", 'contain', 'cute', 'elves', 'warm', 'Santas', 'bathotic', 'family', 'reunions', 'just', 'place', 'Christmas.Jay', 'Parkins', 'young', 'pilot', 'whom', 'flying', 'first', 'place', 'even', 'responsibilities', 'home', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'fired', 'job', 'deliberately', 'annoying', 'client', 'fellow', 'pilot', 'agree', 'fly', 'two', 'crop', 'dusting', 'planes', 'Norfolk', 'Island', 'deep', 'Pacific', 'Ocean', 'plane', 'friend', 'flying', 'malfunctions', 'leave', 'Pago', 'Pago', 'Jay', 'knowing', 'will', 'need', 'fee', 'ferrying', 'plane', 'when', 'son', 'born', 'Unfortunately', 'navigation', 'equipment', 'fouls', 'leaving', 'idea', 'where', 'alone', 'vast', 'Pacific', 'below', 'nearby', 'Air', 'New', 'Zealand', 'commercial', 'flight', 'offers', 'help', 'find', 'him.If', 'tedious', ""n't"", 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'Parkins', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'senior', 'Air', 'New', 'Zealand', 'pilot', 'Gordon', 'Vette', 'brilliantly', 'carry', 'tense', 'film', 'Vette', 'aviation', 'wiles', 'locate', 'Parkins', 'tiny', 'plane', 'men', 'form', 'emotional', 'bond', 'anxious', 'radio', 'Supporting', 'characters', 'such', 'Vette', 'cockpit', 'crew', 'head', 'stewardess', 'Parkins', 'flying', 'partner', 'planeful', 'New', 'Zealanders', 'returning', 'holiday', 'enhance', 'story', 'tension', 'gripping', 'conclusion', 'like', 'good', 'character', 'pieces', 'film', 'highly', 'recommended', 'aviation', 'buffs', 'will', 'probably', 'love', 'too']",Mercy Mission/Nowhere to Land

1083519,A1SS5GY9V97AUB,B000ROAMCK,"Maria Augusto ""Book & Movie addict""","[1, 1]","This DVD is very, very good! Two films about airplane stories and one inspired in real life!My favourite is ""Mercy Mission"" where Scott Bakula and the veteran Robert Loggia are great! Scott is the pilot of a small airplane lost in the Pacific Ocean who is helped to safely land by a commercial airline senior pilot. It is really touching. Watch it if you have not done it yet. It's marvelous!! The second film is not as wonderful as the first one but is worth seeing, indeed. ""Nowhere to land"" is the story of of a flight from Australia to the USA where a maniac ex-husband of one of the passengers hides a gas bomb inside the plane and cowardly leaves the aircraft before it takes off. The fight of the pilot and co-pilot to take the plane safely to land in LA before the gas spreads all over is what makes us watching this good film up to the very end!",5,DOUBLE EMOTION!!,1218412800,"08 11, 2008",2008,854,"['DVD', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'Two', 'films', 'airplane', 'stories', 'one', 'inspired', 'real', 'life', 'favourite', 'Mercy', 'Mission', 'where', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'veteran', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'are', 'great', 'Scott', 'pilot', 'small', 'airplane', 'lost', 'Pacific', 'Ocean', 'who', 'helped', 'safely', 'land', 'commercial', 'airline', 'senior', 'pilot', 'really', 'touching', 'Watch', 'have', 'not', 'done', 'yet', 'marvelous', 'second', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'wonderful', 'first', 'one', 'worth', 'seeing', 'indeed', 'Nowhere', 'land', 'story', 'flight', 'Australia', 'USA', 'where', 'maniac', 'ex-husband', 'one', 'passengers', 'hides', 'gas', 'bomb', 'plane', 'cowardly', 'aircraft', 'off', 'fight', 'pilot', 'co-pilot', 'take', 'plane', 'safely', 'land', 'LA', 'gas', 'over', 'what', 'watching', 'good', 'film', 'up', 'very', 'end']",Mercy Mission/Nowhere to Land

1083521,A1YOYEB5K3XFTU,B000ROAMCK,"MovieLover ""movieloversyd""","[1, 1]","I'm a huge Scott Bakula fan, so Scott was the initial attraction for me. To be honest though , I had no idea whether or not I would enjoy this particular movie -  although after reading other reviewer's comments and knowing that the price I was spending was very reasonable, I figured the chances were pretty good that I would not be disappointed. Needless to say, both actors gave a very convincing and moving performance. Based on a true story, Robert Loggia plays a commercial airline pilot who is flying a passenger loaded plane on an overseas flight. Scott Bakula also plays a pilot, but one who is flying a smaller craft - also overseas - to a buyer. In sum, the smaller craft loses it's way and is lost somewhere in the middle of nowhere, with a tired pilot and a limited amount of fuel. The young pilot manages to contact air traffic control and is then hooked up with the much larger commercial airline. With permission from the passengers the pilot of the larger plane sets out to locate the smaller craft and assist the pilot in finding his way to the airport. There are some tense moments when it seems more and more unlikely that this mission will be a successful one, which should keep viewers glued to the screen. My favorite element of this film however is the relationship that is formed between the two pilots. The older pilot (Robert Loggia) refuses to let the younger pilot (Scott Bakula) give up - even when the situation becomes a dire one as the younger pilot is exhausted and running out of fuel. I wont give away the ending - although most can probably predict - but it is a rewarding one. As T.V. movies go this one is much better than average and it's a very inspiring story that the whole family can enjoy. I would highly recommend it to everyone!!!",5,Kept my attention from start to finish...,1303516800,"04 23, 2011",2011,1777,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'fan', 'so', 'Scott', 'was', 'initial', 'attraction', 'be', 'honest', 'had', 'idea', 'not', 'would', 'enjoy', 'particular', 'movie', 'reading', 'other', 'reviewer', 'comments', 'knowing', 'price', 'was', 'spending', 'was', 'very', 'reasonable', 'figured', 'chances', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Needless', 'say', 'actors', 'gave', 'very', 'convincing', 'moving', 'performance', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'commercial', 'airline', 'pilot', 'who', 'flying', 'passenger', 'loaded', 'plane', 'overseas', 'flight', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'also', 'pilot', 'one', 'who', 'flying', 'smaller', 'craft', 'also', 'overseas', 'buyer', 'sum', 'smaller', 'craft', 'way', 'lost', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'tired', 'pilot', 'limited', 'amount', 'fuel', 'young', 'pilot', 'manages', 'contact', 'air', 'traffic', 'control', 'then', 'hooked', 'up', 'much', 'larger', 'commercial', 'airline', 'permission', 'passengers', 'pilot', 'larger', 'plane', 'sets', 'out', 'locate', 'smaller', 'craft', 'assist', 'pilot', 'finding', 'way', 'airport', 'are', 'tense', 'moments', 'when', 'more', 'more', 'unlikely', 'mission', 'will', 'be', 'successful', 'one', 'should', 'keep', 'viewers', 'glued', 'screen', 'favorite', 'element', 'film', 'however', 'relationship', 'formed', 'two', 'pilots', 'older', 'pilot', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'let', 'younger', 'pilot', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'give', 'up', 'even', 'when', 'situation', 'dire', 'one', 'younger', 'pilot', 'exhausted', 'running', 'out', 'fuel', 'wont', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'most', 'can', 'probably', 'predict', 'rewarding', 'one', 'T.V', 'movies', 'go', 'one', 'much', 'better', 'average', 'very', 'inspiring', 'story', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'everyone']",Mercy Mission/Nowhere to Land
