The acting is subpar and the story doesn't make alot of sense.The characters acted like no normal person would. I wasted my money buying a movie I would't watch on tv.

1553501,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B008HUPCO4,trebe,"[1, 1]","Whether intentional or not, From Beneath (2012) is reminiscent of a really badly made horror film from the 1970's.  The story is weak, the acting is poor, the dialog is terrible, and image quality is not very good.  As the characters continue to do ridiculous things, time loses meaning, in this very slowly paced tale.  It soon becomes clear, that anyone expecting a decent story will be sorely disappointed.  (Some spoilers follow)Jason (Jaime Temple) and his girlfriend Sam (Lauren Watson), arrive at Sam's sister's house, located in an isolated area in British Columbia.  No one seems to be at home, so the couple goes for a swim in a small pond, where some kind of wormlike creature enters Jason's leg.  Through an unlikely chain of events, the couple is unable to call for help, and wind up staying at the house for days, as the injured Jason's condition continues to worsen.While it may be a major personal accomplishment for writer and director David Doucette, to have made something out of so very little, unfortunately for horror fans, his first feature film offers little in the way of quality.  The passage of time comes to have no meaning, as Sam and Jason drift along, in a series of disconnected scenes.  Saying the most absurd things, the couple are neither believable nor likeable, and just seem incredibly inept.  Some suspense is occasionally generated, but usually dissipates quickly, as the loss of either character, would essentially end the film.  When one of the characters does finally perish, matters do quickly conclude, and in a rather predictable way.Even Prime members who can see From Beneath for free, may still feel cheated by very disappointing effort.  A two star rating might be too generous.  Unless you are personally connected with this movie, there are probably much better ways to spend your time.",2,tedious amateur filmmaking...,1365638400,"04 11, 2013",2013,1838,"['Whether', 'intentional', 'not', 'Beneath', '2012', 'reminiscent', 'really', 'badly', 'made', 'horror', 'film', '1970', 'story', 'weak', 'acting', 'poor', 'dialog', 'terrible', 'image', 'quality', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'characters', 'continue', 'do', 'ridiculous', 'things', 'time', 'meaning', 'very', 'slowly', 'paced', 'tale', 'soon', 'clear', 'anyone', 'expecting', 'decent', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'spoilers', 'follow', 'Jason', 'Jaime', 'Temple', 'girlfriend', 'Sam', 'Lauren', 'Watson', 'arrive', 'Sam', 'sister', 'house', 'located', 'isolated', 'area', 'British', 'Columbia', 'one', 'be', 'home', 'couple', 'swim', 'small', 'pond', 'where', 'kind', 'wormlike', 'creature', 'enters', 'Jason', 'leg', 'unlikely', 'chain', 'events', 'couple', 'unable', 'call', 'help', 'wind', 'up', 'staying', 'house', 'days', 'injured', 'Jason', 'condition', 'worsen.While', 'may', 'be', 'major', 'personal', 'accomplishment', 'writer', 'director', 'David', 'Doucette', 'have', 'made', 'something', 'so', 'very', 'little', 'unfortunately', 'horror', 'fans', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'offers', 'little', 'way', 'quality', 'passage', 'time', 'have', 'meaning', 'Sam', 'Jason', 'drift', 'along', 'series', 'disconnected', 'scenes', 'Saying', 'most', 'absurd', 'things', 'couple', 'are', 'believable', 'likeable', 'just', 'seem', 'incredibly', 'inept', 'suspense', 'occasionally', 'generated', 'usually', 'quickly', 'loss', 'character', 'would', 'essentially', 'end', 'film', 'When', 'one', 'characters', 'finally', 'perish', 'matters', 'do', 'quickly', 'conclude', 'rather', 'predictable', 'way.Even', 'Prime', 'members', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'Beneath', 'free', 'may', 'still', 'feel', 'cheated', 'very', 'disappointing', 'effort', 'two', 'star', 'rating', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'generous', 'are', 'personally', 'connected', 'movie', 'are', 'probably', 'much', 'better', 'ways', 'spend', 'time']",From Beneath
1553502,A2TSJ5K7Q4SPFP,B008HUPCO4,William Watts,"[1, 1]","I have just read several reviews on this film, in reading you would think that they were two seperate films. First the acting if you could call it that well,it  sounds like the drivel they are spouting was written by someone with a disabillity and the two people in the film reading the lines like they were doing it off cue cards. I won't spoil a bad watch by revealing to much as why should I be one of the ones to suffer this horror of a movie (not horror movie)there was one saving grace with my copy and that was that it froze at the 52 min mark and saved me wasting anymore time on it. There are just so many rediculas things happenening in this movie it goes into my top ten stinkers for the year with ones such as the Mooring and Snowshark and many more the movie didn't cost an arm and a leg so with all the drama concerned with posting it back from overseas I wont bother so what happens (and I don't realy care) to these poor souls will reamain a mystery as will the reason to finance this mess is.Al Watts",1,Make certain not to swim make certain not to watch,1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,1017,"['have', 'just', 'read', 'several', 'reviews', 'film', 'reading', 'would', 'think', 'were', 'two', 'seperate', 'films', 'First', 'acting', 'could', 'call', 'well', 'drivel', 'are', 'spouting', 'was', 'written', 'someone', 'disabillity', 'two', 'people', 'film', 'reading', 'lines', 'were', 'doing', 'off', 'cue', 'cards', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'bad', 'watch', 'revealing', 'much', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'ones', 'suffer', 'horror', 'movie', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'saving', 'grace', 'copy', 'was', '52', 'min', 'mark', 'saved', 'wasting', 'anymore', 'time', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'rediculas', 'things', 'happenening', 'movie', 'top', 'ten', 'stinkers', 'year', 'ones', 'such', 'Mooring', 'Snowshark', 'many', 'more', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'cost', 'arm', 'leg', 'so', 'drama', 'concerned', 'posting', 'back', 'overseas', 'wont', 'bother', 'so', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'realy', 'care', 'poor', 'souls', 'will', 'reamain', 'mystery', 'will', 'reason', 'finance', 'mess', 'is.Al', 'Watts']",From Beneath
