""Thomas & Friends: A Very Thomas Christmas"" is a wholesome and classic Christmas DVD full of all the classic trains my boys love.  The lessons are simple for kids to pick up such as working together, responsibility and the importance of friends!  There are four episodes on this DVD all about snow or Christmas!  With the new CGI animation the colors are bright and the trains are animated.  This is a perfect DVD for any train lover, and I have a feeling we will be watching this well into summer.",5,What is Christmas without Thomas!,1352332800,"11 8, 2012",2012,543,"['What', 'Christmas', 'Thomas', 'Friends', 'Thomas', 'Friends', 'Very', 'Thomas', 'Christmas', 'wholesome', 'classic', 'Christmas', 'DVD', 'full', 'classic', 'trains', 'boys', 'love', 'lessons', 'are', 'simple', 'kids', 'pick', 'up', 'such', 'working', 'together', 'responsibility', 'importance', 'friends', 'are', 'four', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'about', 'snow', 'Christmas', 'new', 'CGI', 'animation', 'colors', 'are', 'bright', 'trains', 'are', 'animated', 'perfect', 'DVD', 'train', 'lover', 'have', 'feeling', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'well', 'summer']",N/A

Total running time is about 45 minutes, but that includes several intro and outro title sequences. My grandson has heard those songs so many times from watching these collections that he sings them as he's walking around pretending to be a steam engine.This is a great collection to watch as Christmas is fast approaching, but true Thomas fans (like my grandson) will enjoy it any time of the year.If you have a child in your home who loves Thomas & Friends as much as my grandson, these videos are perfect.
