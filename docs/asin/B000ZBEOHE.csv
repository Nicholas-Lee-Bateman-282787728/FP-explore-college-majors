1121765,A3PMEJAYKF3VUC,B000ZBEOHE,"Antoine D. Reid ""80sforever""","[20, 27]","Reading the reviews here on Amazon.com and in other places, I purchased this expecting cutting-edge entertainment that showed and really examined the `down low' culture African-American and Latino (and others) engage in. I expected this to be above and superior to the Logo show `Noah's Arc' that really camped up the gay/queer experience for Black males for the sake of offering a humorous show.`The DL Chronicles' has four episodes to this first season. In my opinion, only one of them has anything of real substance. Otherwise, this is just another show that pretty much takes light of the `down low' culture with odd situations, at times over-the-top acting, cheesy-dialogue that pretty much distracts from the main mission of the show.  Yes, there are a few love scenes mixed in between the men that probably make this show stand out from the others and gives some viewers the impression that it's accomplishing something or is `groundbreaking'. Really, it isn't.The episode ""Boo"" is the most realistic and compelling episode of the small lot. It examines the `thug' culture that seems more rampant and current in today's culture. Seeing how the character Boo, along with his middle-class family, girlfriend, friends and neighbors deal with and confront sexuality, sex, consequences does stand out from most anything I've seen on the DL culture. The other episodes though don't do much at all but stick the generic `boy meets boy' plot and `boy and boy have problem, have sex, go back to problem' formula. The first episode deals with a well-off husband who confronts his sexuality and his wife's gay brother and offered some very over-the-top acting that was distracting. One dealt with a couple's adjusting to living with one another and one's coming out to his family, completely given a comedy-treatment. Another with a father coming out to his daughter that's probably the next best episode to ""Boo"".In all, it's a decent show but the description on the back, and some of the reviews, give the impression it's a much more serious and gritty show than it really is. It's pretty light and comedic for the most part with moments of seriousness. The only episode that doesn't fall victim to mediocrity is ""Boo"" which I wish had been expanded on and given more than just an episode. It was by far more realistic, gritty, `wow' inducing than the other three episodes that were a bit of a let-down from the much hyped series.",3,The Low-Down on 'The DL Chronicles',1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,2428,"['Reading', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon.com', 'other', 'places', 'purchased', 'expecting', 'cutting-edge', 'entertainment', 'showed', 'really', 'examined', 'down', 'low', 'culture', 'African-American', 'Latino', 'others', 'engage', 'expected', 'be', 'superior', 'Logo', 'show', 'Noah', 'Arc', 'really', 'camped', 'up', 'gay/queer', 'experience', 'Black', 'males', 'sake', 'offering', 'humorous', 'show.', 'DL', 'Chronicles', 'four', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'opinion', 'only', 'one', 'anything', 'real', 'substance', 'Otherwise', 'just', 'show', 'pretty', 'much', 'light', 'down', 'low', 'culture', 'odd', 'situations', 'times', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'cheesy-dialogue', 'pretty', 'much', 'distracts', 'main', 'mission', 'show', 'Yes', 'are', 'few', 'love', 'scenes', 'mixed', 'men', 'probably', 'make', 'show', 'stand', 'out', 'others', 'viewers', 'impression', 'accomplishing', 'something', 'groundbreaking', 'Really', 'episode', 'Boo', 'most', 'realistic', 'compelling', 'episode', 'small', 'lot', 'thug', 'culture', 'more', 'rampant', 'current', 'today', 'culture', 'Seeing', 'how', 'character', 'Boo', 'middle-class', 'family', 'girlfriend', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'deal', 'confront', 'sexuality', 'sex', 'consequences', 'stand', 'out', 'most', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'DL', 'culture', 'other', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'stick', 'generic', 'boy', 'meets', 'boy', 'plot', 'boy', 'boy', 'have', 'problem', 'have', 'sex', 'go', 'back', 'problem', 'formula', 'first', 'episode', 'deals', 'well-off', 'husband', 'who', 'sexuality', 'wife', 'gay', 'brother', 'offered', 'very', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'was', 'distracting', 'One', 'dealt', 'couple', 'adjusting', 'living', 'one', 'one', 'coming', 'out', 'family', 'completely', 'given', 'comedy-treatment', 'father', 'coming', 'out', 'daughter', 'probably', 'next', 'best', 'episode', 'Boo', '.In', 'decent', 'show', 'description', 'back', 'reviews', 'give', 'impression', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'gritty', 'show', 'really', 'pretty', 'light', 'comedic', 'most', 'part', 'moments', 'seriousness', 'only', 'episode', ""n't"", 'fall', 'victim', 'mediocrity', 'Boo', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'expanded', 'given', 'more', 'just', 'episode', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'gritty', 'wow', 'inducing', 'other', 'three', 'episodes', 'were', 'bit', 'let-down', 'much', 'hyped', 'series']",The DL Chronicles: Season 1

1121768,A1WPCLH2ZACWPH,B000ZBEOHE,"Charlie B. ""Charlie""","[0, 0]","I stumbled across this film looking for resources to support a paper for school I wrote tackling the representation of Black Gay themes in film.  I didn't know what to expect when I purchased this, but I have to say that the script and acting were equally amazing.The downfall with this series is the writers were concerned too much on the twists and turns in the script (which I must add were well thought out) rather than focusing on the whole DL phenomenon and its effects within the Black [Gay] Community.  The only episode that successfully executed this was the BOO episode, which stands out among the four as being the most thorough and raw depiction of what today's DL Black man by definition stands for.  The longest of the four, the ROBERT episode, may have come close but the twist to the story makes it null and void (which I will not give away).  However, there are many issues about acceptance and struggle in the ROBERT episode that the BOO episode lack, which were on point and resonate today.  Everything else was unfortunately nothing more than any given episode of a soap opera in comparison.For anyone who has watched such promising yet flawed put-together series like ""The Closet"" and ""Noah's Arc,"" you will be taken aback by how believable the cast is, for starters.  The script is well written but drags at times, but the acting makes up for that.I recommend watching each episode from beginning to end to fully understand the story and catch the links between characters from episode to episode.  Because the WES episode starts out really slow compared to the intensity of those that follow, I skipped to the 4th episode, MARK (which turns out to be the most comical and light-hearted of the four), before watching the other two and saying, ""Wait a minute?!"" and doing some rewinding for myself.  But again, watch from beginning to end and pay close attention to the character overlapping for some ""Ahh ha"" moments.Another shortcoming, or maybe just a question that went unanswered, was the whole purpose of the narrator and his involvement with these men.  The narrator is writing a book focusing on DL men and as the episodes intro, he is either writing or talking about the whole DL culture before he starts talking about each individual.  In Episode 1 WES it is revealed how they meet, but I was left wondering how, if he is telling the story, does he know all of this information about Wes.  Were they intimate (which you think is obvious as the story sets up the way they meet, but it never comes into play again)?  Does he know someone who knows these people?  Did they tell their stories to him for his book?  Is he maybe even one of the individuals involved in the stories and he has just changed the names and instances?Maybe another season will offer these answers, but for anyone looking for an extremely entertaining, thought provoking, well-scripted and acted Black film/series of a different kind, I highly recommend this DVD.",4,"Decent, Not to be Missed!",1209600000,"05 1, 2008",2008,2965,"['stumbled', 'film', 'looking', 'resources', 'support', 'paper', 'school', 'wrote', 'tackling', 'representation', 'Black', 'Gay', 'themes', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'purchased', 'have', 'say', 'script', 'acting', 'were', 'equally', 'amazing.The', 'downfall', 'series', 'writers', 'were', 'concerned', 'too', 'much', 'twists', 'turns', 'script', 'must', 'add', 'were', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'rather', 'focusing', 'whole', 'DL', 'phenomenon', 'effects', 'Black', '[', 'Gay', ']', 'Community', 'only', 'episode', 'successfully', 'executed', 'was', 'BOO', 'episode', 'out', 'four', 'being', 'most', 'thorough', 'raw', 'depiction', 'what', 'today', 'DL', 'Black', 'man', 'definition', 'stands', 'longest', 'four', 'ROBERT', 'episode', 'may', 'have', 'come', 'close', 'twist', 'story', 'null', 'void', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'However', 'are', 'many', 'issues', 'acceptance', 'struggle', 'ROBERT', 'episode', 'BOO', 'episode', 'lack', 'were', 'point', 'resonate', 'today', 'Everything', 'else', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'nothing', 'more', 'given', 'episode', 'soap', 'opera', 'comparison.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'such', 'promising', 'yet', 'flawed', 'put-together', 'series', 'Closet', 'Noah', 'Arc', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'aback', 'how', 'believable', 'cast', 'starters', 'script', 'well', 'written', 'times', 'acting', 'up', 'that.I', 'recommend', 'watching', 'episode', 'beginning', 'end', 'fully', 'understand', 'story', 'catch', 'links', 'characters', 'episode', 'episode', 'WES', 'episode', 'out', 'really', 'slow', 'compared', 'intensity', 'follow', 'skipped', '4th', 'episode', 'MARK', 'out', 'be', 'most', 'comical', 'light-hearted', 'four', 'watching', 'other', 'two', 'saying', 'Wait', 'minute', 'doing', 'rewinding', 'again', 'watch', 'beginning', 'end', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'character', 'overlapping', 'Ahh', 'ha', 'moments.Another', 'shortcoming', 'maybe', 'just', 'question', 'went', 'unanswered', 'was', 'whole', 'purpose', 'narrator', 'involvement', 'men', 'narrator', 'writing', 'book', 'focusing', 'DL', 'men', 'episodes', 'intro', 'writing', 'talking', 'whole', 'DL', 'culture', 'talking', 'individual', 'Episode', '1', 'WES', 'revealed', 'how', 'meet', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'how', 'telling', 'story', 'know', 'information', 'Wes', 'Were', 'intimate', 'think', 'obvious', 'story', 'up', 'way', 'meet', 'never', 'play', 'again', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'people', 'Did', 'tell', 'stories', 'book', 'maybe', 'even', 'one', 'individuals', 'involved', 'stories', 'just', 'changed', 'names', 'instances', 'Maybe', 'season', 'will', 'offer', 'answers', 'anyone', 'looking', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'thought', 'provoking', 'well-scripted', 'acted', 'Black', 'film/series', 'different', 'kind', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD']",The DL Chronicles: Season 1

1121774,A1ST1XBL6EQTBV,B000ZBEOHE,HE WHO FUNKS BEHIND THE ROWS!!,"[53, 55]","This DVD expertly captures the many differentscenarios and complexities of the modern urbanphenomenon called ""The DL"" (Down Low) or a closetedgay or bisexual man( usually black or latino, but notexclusively!) who lives a dual life of sleeping with womento keep up their public image / street cred / family ties,etc., while secretly indulging in intimate encounterswith other men!--It's been going on for years!Of course, these men insist on and, in some cases,will fight you to prove that they're straight!But it's a sad game of self-deception,self-denial and ultimately, self-hate, which leaveslives turned upside down when the inevitable truth comesto the light! This series brilliantly captures all ofthis through its main case studies:Wes, the sucessful married executive who is a beautifulman with a beautiful wife and a seemingly beautiful life that,as we go under the surface, hides deeper inner pain andlonging which is brought bubbling to the surface whenhis wife's devastingly gorgeous, manipulative and roguishgay brother comes to stay with them for awhile to""get on his feet""!!---That ain't all he gets on!Then there's Robert, the handsome everyday guy who isa sucessful talent agent who was once married and hasa college-aged daughter who lives with him who has noclue that her dad spends his free time in gay chat rooms,cruising guys on the internet and having secret gay liasons.His life is turned upside down when he meets anattractive openly gay, but not nelly, man who owns a healthstore and through their budding relationship, Robertis transformed and learns the meaning of honesty,love and self-acceptance.Then there's BOO--The stereotypical ""thug"",whose hyper-masculine swagger, hip-hop era (outwardly)homophobic attitude, sagging jeans, 3/4 timbz,wife beater teez and exposed boxers are in sharp contrastto what he really likes to get down in when he isn'tfighting with his hood-rat girlfreind Keisha,who puts him out at least twice a weekor mooching off of his church-going, bible-thumping mother!Who is the type to say she's a loving christian,but then bashes and condemns those who aren't likeher every chance she gets!Boo is a ""man-boy"", who though he's very mucha grown man physically, is but a child both emotionally& mentally!--A very common occurence these days!He accepts no responsibility for his life on any level,thinks he has the answer between his legs to all theworld's problems, puts down gays in one breath whilesleeping with them every chance he gets!--He also cheatswith other women too!--Just the quintessential ""playa"" type.Anywayz, this scenario plays out with alot of interesting plottwists that will keep you laughing and oohing and ahhing!Lastly, there's Mark and Dante, a black and latinomiddle class gay couple of 3 yrs who reside in San Franciscowho are making leaps and bounds in their relationship whenthey get an unexpected and uninvited visit from Mark's ol'sorry-azz drifter no-account cousin, Terrell, who bringsbaggage of all kinds with him from L.A.!!But the guy is sooo funny too!This story has a lot of great twists to it as well!--Without giving everything away, this is a great seriesbecause it is done intelligently, with humor and with greatsensitivity. It also rings true in so many ways and reallyopens up understanding in those whose hearts and minds areopen and may either be in this situation or has a freindor family member in this situation.In the black and latino communities, there is suchan ugly and heavy stigma and homophobiaagainst gays that a lot of people,thankfullly not myself, feel they have to live thisDL lifestyle just to function and remain close to theones they love and hold on to whatever it is that theythink they have accrued in this life.But the truth is the light, and I hope that throughfilms like this that don't use stereotypes and showgay/bi men of color as what they really are---men,in every sense, who just, through natural selectionor fate, share a different end of the sexual spectrumfrom their mainstream counterparts and deserved to beloved and valued like any other human beingas part of the bigger human family.Through stories like these, intelligent, respectfuland understanding dialogue can be started amongstfreinds, amongst family members, etc., to overcomewhat really shouldn't be an issue anywayz!--And hey,if they abandon you, then they didn't love you for youanyway and should be considered good riddanceto bad rubbish! Self-Love, Self-Acceptance,Self-Acknowledgement, etc. and living your truth willlead to a richer and fuller life for all parties concerned...gay/bi/straight or whatever!But, personal philosophies aside, this series(the complete first season) is a great andgroundbreaking step in the right direction andI can't wait to see more!It's well worth the money to add thisto your

1121776,A1L02INGWOE4JI,B000ZBEOHE,Jim W,"[0, 0]",I was pleasantly surprised. I bought this DVD on a whim. The term DL is always negatively associated with black men while our white counter part (ie brokeback mountain) is heralded as a gay love story. I was pleased that it was not stories of Black men who habitually cheat on their wives and girlfriends. While a couple of the shorts involved the secret lives - others where about coming out (or not) and the fear of losing friends and family members as a result of that choice. Episode 1 Wes - his story is not finished - so I'm not sure he is on the DL or just made a bad decision during a drunken pity party - it dosen't mean he will continue to sleep with menEpisode 2 Robert - A middle age man who is embarking on a new relationship for the first time with a man and afraid for his college age daughter to find out - this is not DL - this is more coming out.Episode 4 Mark -  A couple living together - tries to hide the statis of their relationship from an univited out of town relative- again not DL ..  this is closetNow edisode 3 Boo - this is DL ..this character is freely sexing both men and women without any regard for safe sex practices -while adamantly denying being gay (his rationale he doesn't get f**ked and he'll let a guy suck him or he'll do him and that is different) this is the most compelling character in the whole series. Boo really is on the DL  he has no remorse or desire to make a choice or make a change - the life of a DL man is self servingI recommend this product and I hope the makers will continue to explore the various  life experiences of gay men - I just wished they named it something else - the show really explores the different struggles in self acceptance verses the life of a DL man,5,good enough to watch the next season,1219708800,"08 26, 2008",2008,1731,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'bought', 'DVD', 'whim', 'term', 'DL', 'always', 'negatively', 'associated', 'black', 'men', 'white', 'counter', 'part', 'ie', 'brokeback', 'mountain', 'heralded', 'gay', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'pleased', 'was', 'not', 'stories', 'Black', 'men', 'who', 'habitually', 'cheat', 'wives', 'girlfriends', 'couple', 'shorts', 'involved', 'secret', 'others', 'where', 'coming', 'out', 'not', 'fear', 'losing', 'friends', 'family', 'members', 'result', 'choice', 'Episode', '1', 'Wes', 'story', 'not', 'finished', 'so', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'DL', 'just', 'made', 'bad', 'decision', 'drunken', 'pity', 'party', 'dose', ""n't"", 'mean', 'will', 'continue', 'sleep', 'menEpisode', '2', 'Robert', 'middle', 'age', 'man', 'who', 'embarking', 'new', 'relationship', 'first', 'time', 'man', 'afraid', 'college', 'age', 'daughter', 'find', 'out', 'not', 'DL', 'more', 'coming', 'out.Episode', '4', 'Mark', 'couple', 'living', 'together', 'tries', 'hide', 'statis', 'relationship', 'univited', 'town', 'relative-', 'again', 'not', 'DL', '..', 'closetNow', 'edisode', '3', 'Boo', 'DL', '..this', 'character', 'freely', 'sexing', 'men', 'women', 'regard', 'safe', 'sex', 'practices', '-while', 'adamantly', 'denying', 'being', 'gay', 'rationale', ""n't"", 'get', 'f**ked', ""'ll"", 'let', 'guy', 'suck', ""'ll"", 'do', 'different', 'most', 'compelling', 'character', 'whole', 'series', 'Boo', 'really', 'DL', 'remorse', 'desire', 'make', 'choice', 'make', 'change', 'life', 'DL', 'man', 'self', 'servingI', 'recommend', 'product', 'hope', 'makers', 'will', 'continue', 'explore', 'various', 'life', 'experiences', 'gay', 'men', 'just', 'wished', 'named', 'something', 'else', 'show', 'really', 'different', 'struggles', 'self', 'acceptance', 'life', 'DL', 'man']",The DL Chronicles: Season 1

1121781,A70YTUFJY5HXN,B000ZBEOHE,Olukayode Balogun,"[25, 27]","For anyone who may not already know, a man on the ""Down Low"" or ""DL"", is one who secretly has sex with other men while pretending he only has sex with women. Such men can be single, have long-term girlfriends, fianc&eacute;es, wives and even children and they rarely form romantic relationships with the men they have sex with. This sexual behaviour can be seen all over the world of course and is not in any way unique to the US. Neither is it the sole preserve of black men or even men in general, as men AND women of all ethnicities are also known to behave in correspondingly similar ways.For reasons I haven't been able to determine however, African American and Latino men have chosen to formalise or institutionalise this phenomenon and coined and embraced the ""DL"" term. J. L. King wrote a book about it and went on Oprah to tell her and her wide-eyed studio audience how it's done, (apparently from first-hand experience), and in his bookBeyond the Down Low: Sex, Lies, and Denial in Black America, writer, activist and broadcaster Keith Boykin put together the most adequate exploration of this complex and intriguing phenomenon I've ever come across. I've heard - I've never met one of them personally myself - that these men are quite proud to proclaim themselves as being on the DL and are reported to be a really big deal in the eyes of the men who are said to lust after them. Each to his own, I suppose.I do find it interesting though that unlike most social developments in the US, this is one that hasn't succeeded in crossing over the Atlantic to the UK. At least not yet. The behaviour exists, obviously, but the label just hasn't found a home here - and I would know.Anyway, to the DVD. Though I had some preconceptions, I didn't know exactly what to expect. I deliberately didn't read anything about the DVD, not even any other reviews here on Amazon. I didn't even read the splurge on the back of the DVD (although I was surprised to see that the whole season was contained on just the one disc); I just put it in, sat back and watched. I was pleasantly surprised.The season can fit into just the one disc because there are only four episodes to it. Created, produced & directed by real-life couple Deondray Gossett and Quincy LeNear, all four episodes - two written by Gossett, the other two by LeNear - are all woven together by narrator Chadwick (played by Damian Toofeek Raven) who plays an aspiring journalist who's writing a book about men he's met and knows about. He only gets to physically meet one of the men whose stories are featured here so I had to assume he knew of the other three. Each episode is about each of these four men.First off is Wes, a married real estate banker (played by Darren Shnase), whose wife Sarah (played by Jessica Bashir) tells him one day that her ""weird"" brother Trent (played by Ty Vincent) will be staying with them for a while. It's clear from the onset that Trent makes Wes uncomfortable and he seems to know something about Wes that we don't.The second episode introduces Robert, a talent agent (played by Terrell Tilford), who meets a charming young man named Austin (played by Austin Wade) after an incident in the health store Austin manages. In a case of coincidence that stretches the imagination somewhat, the two later meet online and arrange to meet. Robert appears eager and evasive all at the same time and Austin wants to take things slow. This episode is given added vigour by the performance of Sheilynn Wactor, who plays Austin's fiesty co-worker Shirley. Karamo (from MTV's Philadelphia season of ""The Real World"" has a cameo appearance, acting, ironically, the role of a straight dude. This is a better story than the previous one. I laughed out loud in places and I was slack-jawed towards the end.We meet Boo (played by Oneil Cespedes) in episode three, and while this is supposed to be an episode that challenges stereotypes, to me, Boo was a stereotype walking. Hard-acting, tough-talking, bald-headed, Timberland-wearing and with tattoos and trousers down around his thighs, he was the archetypal thug. He was also hypersexual to boot and seemed to be sleeping with everyone, male and female. The good thing about this episode though, was that it went a long way to explain some of the reasons why these men behave in the way they do and it also bravely introduces the tricky issue of HIV/AIDS into the mix. There's a gasp-inducing moment where I'm sure a lot of folks will be reaching for the review and pause buttons on their remotes and, speaking for myself, I was particularly taken with Boo's friend Deron (played by Anthony Clark).The final episode, perhaps wisely after the issues raised in episode three, decides to go for humour and we meet Mark (played by Ulrich Que), who's in a long-term committed relationship with partner Donte (played by Colbert Alembert). Mark's zany cousin Terrell (played by Dee Gibson) drops by unexpectedly and uninvited one day and asks if he can crash for a while. He's apparently fallen out with his girlfriend Regina. Terrell doesn't know that Mark is gay and poor Donte has to pretend to be Mark's roommate and he's NOT pleased. The stage is thus set for a whole lot of drama and misadventure. There's a shock twist to this story that I did NOT see coming and I'm usually good with that sort of thing. The end had me in absolute hysterics.I really commend the show's creators and makers for this piece of work. Every single one of the preconceptions I had about the series was smashed (I thought the actors were all going to be chiselled-jawed model types; I thought the scenarios were all going to be E. Lynn Harris-esque upper-middle class, with lots of flashy cars, first-class flights, talk of designer labels and the like; I thought the talk would be all about sex and I was wrong on all three counts) and although there were a few ""Nollywood"" moments, on the whole the series was very well acted and very well directed. I also have to commend here! - I believe it's a cable channel - for taking the series on. There were enough love scenes and scenes of  full nudity to make it interesting without it being too tacky. I actually like this better thanNoah's Arc - The Complete First Season.Most crucially though, I feel that no matter what opinions we may hold about this breed of men, this series will go some way to enabling us to understand them better. I certainly do. I used to believe that they were a bunch of duplicitous, selfish and dangerous renegades but while I don't excuse what they do and probably never will, at least I now know it's a lot more complicated than that. At the end of the day, if the society we live in wasn't so virulently homophobic and patently heterosexist, these kinds of men would probably not exist. I have a feeling they're not all that happy living the way they do and as fellow human beings - men, women, gay, straight, bisexual, black, white or whatever - I feel we all need to be concerned about that.It'll be interesting to see where these guys go for season two. I'm looking forward to it.PS. Sorry the review is so long but I had a lot to say about this one!",5,I was pleasantly surprised,1204502400,"03 3, 2008",2008,7140,"['anyone', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'already', 'know', 'man', 'Down',

Storylines usually have a thin plot revolving around some intrigue and the sexual awakening of African-American men. Well photographed, artful, sensuous love scenes with nudity as well as sultry, moody music are characteristic of most episodes.The series was created by filmmakers Quincy LeNear and Deondray Gossett. Quincy LeNear and Deondray Gossett also serve as the producers and directors of the series.Episode 1: WesWes Thomas (Darren Schnase), an upwardly mobile real estate banker soons finds himself overwhelmed by the demands of his marriage, career, and closeted attraction to men.

1121786,A3F2LSOZYJUTKO,B000ZBEOHE,"Zee Jai ""Liberator migr ire""","[1, 1]","Not so very long ago, exclusively gay TV shows were non-existent. Certainly, there were gay characters in mainstream shows, but no shows just for us. That's all changed in the last few years, and since Queer As Folk debuted in 1999 (with a superior US version appearing the following year), TV shows in which we're the majority - not the minority - have been springing up like erections in a Bel Ami flick. Noah's Arc, Dante's Cove, Metrosexuality, The Closet - and The DL Chronicles.The DL Chronicles differs from its cousins in looking at a different set of characters in each self-contained episode, with narrator Chadwick Williams (Damian T. Raven) and the theme of ""men of color"" living sexually duplicitous and secret lifestyles the unifying factors. The four episodes that make up the first season are refreshingly varied, featuring men in various situations and of differing circumstance. But cast an eye over a handful of reviews of this series and you'll discover it's the third episode, Boo, which receives the most acclaim.Undoubtably, Oneil Cespedes, playing Boo, is platinum grade eye candy, and turns in one of the strongest performances in all the episodes; it's also one of the best realised episodes. But the story - that of a downlow player and a thug - is the most obvious one; it's a crowdpleaser. Everyone wants to be a thug, and those that don't wanna get one. In particular, Boo has been trumpeted as the definitive vision of black gay masculinity, against Noah's Arc, which critics accuse of camping it up (presumably for showing some gay men acting fem). That isn't a criticism of the episode, however, just a rationale for its popularity amongst viewers.Interestingly, Boo is shown sleeping with just about anyone - female, male, black, white, whatever. Despite being sold as a series about ""men of color"", the cast is actually racially ambiguous, and doesn't seem intent on perpetuating racial separtism in the gay community like Queer As Folk (which in five years didn't feature any non-white characters) and Noah's Arc (where the only whites seen on screen were gay bashers).The other episodes are all strong in their own right, and often surprising. My only real gripe is the intrusive and dated background music - give me the intelligent, soundtrack-free experience of The Wire and The Shield. The ponderous piano employed on The DL Chronicles, so beloved of indie producers, is jarring.Music aside, The DL Chronicles is hugely enjoyable, heartfelt, and perhaps most importantly, promises much more. Roll on season two.",4,Be My Boo,1205020800,"03 9, 2008",2008,2551,"['Not', 'so', 'very', 'long', 'ago', 'exclusively', 'gay', 'TV', 'shows', 'were', 'non-existent', 'Certainly', 'were', 'gay', 'characters', 'mainstream', 'shows', 'shows', 'just', 'changed', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'debuted', '1999', 'superior', 'US', 'version', 'appearing', 'following', 'year', 'TV', 'shows', ""'re"", 'majority', 'not', 'minority', 'have', 'been', 'springing', 'up', 'erections', 'Bel', 'Ami', 'flick', 'Noah', 'Arc', 'Dante', 'Cove', 'Metrosexuality', 'Closet', 'DL', 'Chronicles.The', 'DL', 'Chronicles', 'differs', 'cousins', 'looking', 'different', 'set', 'characters', 'self-contained', 'episode', 'narrator', 'Chadwick', 'Williams', 'Damian', 'T.', 'Raven', 'theme', 'men', 'color', 'living', 'sexually', 'duplicitous', 'secret', 'unifying', 'factors', 'four', 'episodes', 'make', 'up', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'refreshingly', 'varied', 'featuring', 'men', 'various', 'situations', 'differing', 'circumstance', 'cast', 'eye', 'handful', 'reviews', 'series', ""'ll"", 'discover', 'third', 'episode', 'Boo', 'most', 'acclaim.Undoubtably', 'Oneil', 'Cespedes', 'playing', 'Boo', 'platinum', 'grade', 'eye', 'candy', 'one', 'strongest', 'performances', 'episodes', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'realised', 'episodes', 'story', 'downlow', 'player', 'thug', 'most', 'obvious', 'one', 'crowdpleaser', 'Everyone', 'be', 'thug', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'get', 'one', 'particular', 'Boo', 'been', 'trumpeted', 'definitive', 'vision', 'black', 'gay', 'masculinity', 'Noah', 'Arc', 'critics', 'camping', 'up', 'presumably', 'showing', 'gay', 'men', 'acting', 'fem', ""n't"", 'criticism', 'episode', 'however', 'just', 'rationale', 'popularity', 'amongst', 'viewers.Interestingly', 'Boo', 'shown', 'sleeping', 'just', 'anyone', 'female', 'male', 'black', 'white', 'being', 'sold', 'series', 'men', 'color', 'cast', 'actually', 'racially', 'ambiguous', ""n't"", 'seem', 'intent', 'perpetuating', 'racial', 'separtism', 'gay', 'community', 'like', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'five', 'years', 'did', ""n't"", 'feature', 'non-white', 'characters', 'Noah', 'Arc', 'where', 'only', 'seen', 'screen', 'were', 'gay', 'bashers', '.The', 'other', 'episodes', 'are', 'strong', 'own', 'right', 'often', 'surprising', 'only', 'real', 'gripe', 'intrusive', 'dated', 'background', 'music', 'give', 'intelligent', 'soundtrack-free', 'experience', 'Wire', 'Shield', 'ponderous', 'piano', 'employed', 'DL', 'Chronicles', 'so', 'beloved', 'indie', 'producers', 'jarring.Music', 'aside', 'DL', 'Chronicles', 'hugely', 'enjoyable', 'heartfelt', 'perhaps', 'most', 'importantly', 'much', 'more', 'Roll', 'season', 'two']",The DL Chronicles: Season 1
