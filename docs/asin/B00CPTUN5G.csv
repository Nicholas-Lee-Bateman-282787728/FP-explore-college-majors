1650013,A2ACUF3JRM4FW3,B00CPTUN5G,American Goth,"[0, 0]","I am a Brony of sorts, and I give this movie five stars.When one of my little buddies found out that I had ordered the BluRay version of MLP-EG, she decided tohave a slumber party where she and all of her little friends could spend an evening watching it.Then she asked me if they could watch my copy, depending on the Power of Cuteness to get her way, aslittle girls so often do.Her parents wisely decided that they had plans for that night, and that it was my duty to babysit, as it was,after all, my copy of the movie that started the whole thing rolling. Or snowballing, as it turned out.So I found myself playing sheepdog for the night to an avalanche of adorability. Watching Equestria Girlsover and over. With repeats of the most popular scenes, like the Cafeteria rally.Y'know, I liked it. The little girls, who comprised it's target audience, loved it. Five stars, indeed.Now, let me address some of the critics here on Amazon:#1, this movie was not meant to represent any particular type of schoolkid. I doubt if there were very manyfat girls who walked away from this movie feeling sad because no character looked like them. If there were,then they have way more problems that any movie can counter.In fact, I doubt if there were any black-haired, chocolate skinned darlings who walked away sad for thesame reason. Or any lighter-shinned or Asian girls, either. Face it, under those circumstances, the onlygirls who would be satisfied would be the punks, goths, emos and other alts. Because most of thecharacters in this movie, even the adults, looked like nobody in real life. Because, y'know, purple skin?Green hair?Don't get me started on body image. OH MY GOD! This movie is telling little girls that their ideal body wouldhave their feet amputated to fit them into stubby tube boots! Waaahhhh! Evil!Get real, folks. It's a movie, not a life-changing event.#2, this movie was produced for little girls, not Bronies. So the whole ponies-as-humans line of whining ispretty much a wash. The target audience loves it, and that's all that matters.In fact, why are the Bronies complaining so vociferously about the writers doing something THAT BRONIESTHEMSELVES DO SO MUCH OF? Just do a search for &#34;Pony Porn&#34; sometime... Rather, don't. What you willsee can never be unseen. Just don't.#3, the movie was a little preachy in spots. Yeah, a movie that shows different groups of kids like rockers,artists, jocks and ecos cooperating to accomplish good goals is a bad thing right? The target audienceseemed to like it, so get stuffed.In the end, I will give this movie five stars. It was well written, with a good story and message, the artisticstyle was faithful to the MLP series, and the characters' personalities and behaviors were faithful to theirMLP prototypes. I especially liked all of the background characters that you could recognize asbackground characters from the MLP series, like Photo Finish and others. They even had their cutie marksworked into the decorations on their clothing, which was a nice touch.But the major reason for my giving it five stars has little to do with the fact that I enjoyed watching it.The major reason is that the little girls I know enjoyed watching it. And in the end, that's what matters.Priorities, people!",5,Faithful to MLP style.,1377388800,"08 25, 2013",2013,3267,"['am', 'Brony', 'sorts', 'give', 'movie', 'five', 'stars.When', 'one', 'little', 'buddies', 'found', 'had', 'ordered', 'BluRay', 'version', 'MLP-EG', 'decided', 'tohave', 'slumber', 'party', 'where', 'little', 'friends', 'could', 'spend', 'evening', 'watching', 'it.Then', 'asked', 'could', 'watch', 'copy', 'depending', 'Power', 'Cuteness', 'get', 'way', 'aslittle', 'girls', 'so', 'often', 'do.Her', 'parents', 'wisely', 'decided', 'had', 'plans', 'night', 'was', 'duty', 'babysit', 'was', 'copy', 'movie', 'started', 'whole', 'thing', 'rolling', 'snowballing', 'turned', 'out.So', 'found', 'playing', 'sheepdog', 'night', 'avalanche', 'adorability', 'Watching', 'Equestria', 'Girlsover', 'over', 'repeats', 'most', 'popular', 'scenes', 'Cafeteria', ""rally.Y'know"", 'liked', 'little', 'girls', 'who', 'comprised', 'target', 'audience', 'loved', 'Five', 'stars', 'indeed.Now', 'let', 'address', 'critics', 'here', 'Amazon', '1', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'meant', 'represent', 'particular', 'type', 'schoolkid', 'doubt', 'were', 'very', 'manyfat', 'girls', 'who', 'walked', 'away', 'movie', 'feeling', 'sad', 'character', 'looked', 'were', 'then', 'have', 'way', 'more', 'problems', 'movie', 'can', 'counter.In', 'fact', 'doubt', 'were', 'black-haired', 'chocolate', 'skinned', 'darlings', 'who', 'walked', 'away', 'sad', 'thesame', 'reason', 'lighter-shinned', 'Asian', 'girls', 'either', 'Face', 'circumstances', 'onlygirls', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'satisfied', 'would', 'be', 'punks', 'goths', 'emos', 'other', 'alts', 'most', 'thecharacters', 'movie', 'even', 'adults', 'looked', 'nobody', 'real', 'life', ""y'know"", 'purple', 'skin', 'Green', 'hair', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', 'body', 'image', 'OH', 'MY', 'GOD', 'movie', 'telling', 'little', 'girls', 'ideal', 'body', 'wouldhave', 'feet', 'amputated', 'fit', 'stubby', 'tube', 'boots', 'Waaahhhh', 'Evil', 'Get', 'real', 'folks', 'movie', 'not', 'life-changing', 'event.', '2', 'movie', 'was', 'produced', 'little', 'girls', 'not', 'Bronies', 'whole', 'ponies-as-humans', 'line', 'whining', 'ispretty', 'much', 'wash', 'target', 'audience', 'matters.In', 'fact', 'why', 'are', 'Bronies', 'complaining', 'so', 'vociferously', 'writers', 'doing', 'something', 'THAT', 'BRONIESTHEMSELVES', 'DO', 'SO', 'MUCH', 'OF', 'Just', 'do', 'search', '34', 'Pony', 'Porn', '34', 'sometime', 'Rather', 'do', ""n't"", 'What', 'willsee', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'unseen', 'Just', ""don't."", '3', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'preachy', 'spots', 'Yeah', 'movie', 'different', 'groups', 'kids', 'rockers', 'artists', 'jocks', 'ecos', 'cooperating', 'accomplish', 'good', 'goals', 'bad', 'thing', 'right', 'target', 'audienceseemed', 'so', 'get', 'stuffed.In', 'end', 'will', 'give', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'good', 'story', 'message', 'artisticstyle', 'was', 'faithful', 'MLP', 'series', 'characters', 'personalities', 'behaviors', 'were', 'faithful', 'theirMLP', 'prototypes', 'especially', 'liked', 'background', 'characters', 'could', 'recognize', 'asbackground', 'characters', 'MLP', 'series', 'Photo', 'Finish', 'others', 'even', 'had', 'cutie', 'marksworked', 'decorations', 'clothing', 'was', 'nice', 'touch.But', 'major', 'reason', 'giving', 'five', 'stars', 'little', 'do', 'fact', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'it.The', 'major', 'reason', 'little', 'girls', 'know', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'end', 'what', 'people']",My Little Pony: Equestria Girls

Essentially there is an alternate universe, where everypony not only has the same names, but lives somewhat similar lives, (as far as personalities and experiences, even though things are in general much more like we experience life here...)I do not want to spoil the show,  but it has great music, in many ways matching, if not surpassing many of the musical highlights from the series.Probably the BEST thing about this video release particularly is that it was released on BLU-RAY in FULL HD!  Now if they would also release the TV series on BD here in the USA.

1650031,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B00CPTUN5G,"Elias B. ""The Atlanta Fried Critic""","[3, 5]","When the first screenshots for ""Equestria Girls"" surfaced, let's just say ""love and tolerance"" weren't the first words that came to mind. No, instead, I reacted like a good portion of the fanbase: angry, upset, and honestly, like I had been deeply betrayed. It appeared that Hasbro had finally forsaken the audience that made ""Friendship is Magic"" such a big deal in the first place, and that they were solely pandering to the intended demographic. But upon actually watching it, my tune has changed. ""My Little Pony: Equestria Girls"" reminds me why I fell in love with this series in the first place, and why I'm still proud to call myself a part of this excellent fandom.The story kicks off with protagonist, Twilight Sparkle, getting used to her new princesshood after the events of Season Three. She doesn't have much time to adjust, however, as an old student of Princess Celestia's steals Twilight's magical crown in the middle of the night, and bolts off to an alternate dimension. Tasked with regaining it, and with all of Equestria at stake, our heroine dashes into this strange new world of... humans?!That's right, as you might have guessed by the promotional materials, Equestria Girls is a seemingly cynical attempt to sell humanoid dolls to children. Twilight finds herself in a high school, complete with human replicas of her friends, and must become Canterlot High School's equivalent of the prom queen to get back her crown. Unfortunately her rival has some nasty tricks up her sleeve, such as spreading gossip and framing Twilight for acts of vandalism. All this, and the fledgling princess has to deal with her first crush. Oh, what's a girl to do?Yes, it all sounds very silly and childish, and that's really because it is. This is more blatantly pitched to little kids than the series has been recently, and because of that, it's almost like a breath of fresh air. There's a certain vibe of innocence to it that can't really be explained, yet somehow managed to make me smile the entire time. Through cheesy ""girls' night makeover"" montages and through positively adorable music numbers, I could not stop grinning and laughing like I was ten years old again. It takes a lot for something to make me drop my naturally cynical streak, but ""Equestria Girls"" managed to disarm and charm me in one fell, joyous swoop.Not to say there isn't stuff for fans here as well. Longtime viewers will likely laugh with glee (I know I did) as fan-favorite background ponies get humanized, with charming results. Especially great is the focus on characters whom the community has embraced over time, such as ""The Great and Powerful"" Trixie Lulamoon (whose cameo had me in stitches) and DJ Pon-3/Vinyl Scratch. And yes, before you ask, a certain lazy-eyed pony makes an appearance, but you might have to wait a little while to see her...With colorful, vibrant animation, and an infectious musical score, this movie exceeded all of my expectations. This is something that I feel any child would adore, and that any parent would get a kick out of watching with them. Not only that, but it carries on the series' fan-pleasing tradition, and evoking memories of those late 90's Cartoon Network shows we all loved so much. Everything about this movie made me happy, and I watched in thrall until the end of its disappointingly short runtime.""My Little Pony: Equestria Girls"" is more than I ever expected it to be, and quite frankly, more fun and zesty than a good portion of Season 3. With the ending acting both as a potential lead-in to a spin-off AND to a stellar fourth season, this is one movie that kids, parents and fans alike should not miss out on. It's definitely worth adding to your collection.Now... can we get that Season 4 premiere date, please?Overall: A-",5,Phenomenal Children's Entertainment and A Love Letter To Fans,1374710400,"07 25, 2013",2013,3770,"['When', 'first', 'screenshots', 'Equestria', 'Girls', 'surfaced', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'love', 'tolerance', 'were', ""n't"", 'first', 'words', 'came', 'mind', 'No', 'instead', 'reacted', 'good', 'portion', 'fanbase', 'angry', 'upset', 'honestly', 'had', 'been', 'deeply', 'betrayed', 'appeared', 'Hasbro', 'had', 'finally', 'forsaken', 'audience', 'made', 'Friendship', 'Magic', 'big', 'deal', 'first', 'place', 'were', 'solely', 'pandering', 'intended', 'demographic', 'actually', 'watching', 'tune', 'changed', 'Little', 'Pony', 'Equestria', 'Girls', 'why', 'fell', 'love', 'series', 'first', 'place', 'why', ""'m"", 'still', 'proud', 'call', 'part', 'excellent', 'fandom.The', 'story', 'kicks', 'off', 'protagonist', 'Twilight', 'Sparkle', 'getting', 'used', 'new', 'princesshood', 'events', 'Season', 'Three', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'time', 'adjust', 'however', 'old', 'student', 'Princess', 'Celestia', 'steals', 'Twilight', 'magical', 'crown', 'middle', 'night', 'bolts', 'off', 'alternate', 'dimension', 'Tasked', 'regaining', 'Equestria', 'stake', 'heroine', 'strange', 'new', 'world', 'humans', 'right', 'might', 'have', 'guessed', 'promotional', 'materials', 'Equestria', 'Girls', 'seemingly', 'cynical', 'attempt', 'sell', 'humanoid', 'dolls', 'children', 'Twilight', 'high', 'school', 'complete', 'human', 'replicas', 'friends', 'must', 'become', 'Canterlot', 'High', 'School', 'equivalent', 'prom', 'queen', 'get', 'back', 'crown', 'Unfortunately', 'rival', 'nasty', 'tricks', 'up', 'sleeve', 'such', 'spreading', 'gossip', 'framing', 'Twilight', 'acts', 'vandalism', 'fledgling', 'princess', 'deal', 'first', 'crush', 'Oh', 'what', 'girl', 'do', 'Yes', 'very', 'silly', 'childish', 'really', 'more', 'blatantly', 'pitched', 'little', 'kids', 'series', 'been', 'recently', 'almost', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'certain', 'vibe', 'innocence', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'explained', 'yet', 'somehow', 'managed', 'make', 'smile', 'entire', 'time', 'cheesy', 'girls', 'night', 'makeover', 'montages', 'positively', 'adorable', 'music', 'numbers', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'grinning', 'laughing', 'was', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'again', 'lot', 'something', 'make', 'drop', 'naturally', 'cynical', 'streak', 'Equestria', 'Girls', 'managed', 'disarm', 'charm', 'one', 'fell', 'joyous', 'swoop.Not', 'say', ""n't"", 'stuff', 'fans', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Longtime', 'viewers', 'will', 'likely', 'glee', 'know', 'did', 'fan-favorite', 'background', 'ponies', 'get', 'humanized', 'charming', 'results', 'Especially', 'great', 'focus', 'characters', 'whom', 'community', 'embraced', 'time', 'such', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'Trixie', 'Lulamoon', 'cameo', 'had', 'stitches', 'DJ', 'Pon-3/Vinyl', 'Scratch', 'yes', 'ask', 'certain', 'lazy-eyed', 'pony', 'appearance', 'might', 'have', 'wait', 'little', 'while', 'see', 'colorful', 'vibrant', 'animation', 'infectious', 'musical', 'score', 'movie', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'something', 'feel', 'child', 'would', 'adore', 'parent', 'would', 'get', 'kick', 'watching', 'Not', 'only', 'series', 'fan-pleasing', 'tradition', 'evoking', 'memories', 'late', '90', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'Everything', 'movie', 'made', 'happy', 'watched', 'thrall', 'end', 'disappointingly', 'short', 'runtime', 'Little', 'Pony', 'Equestria', 'Girls', 'more', 'ever', 'expected', 'be', 'quite', 'frankly', 'more', 'fun', 'zesty', 'good', 'portion', 'Season', '3', 'ending', 'acting', 'potential', 'lead-in', 'spin-off', 'AND', 'stellar', 'fourth', 'season', 'one', 'movie', 'kids', 'parents', 'fans', 'alike', 'should', 'not', 'miss', 'out', 'definitely', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection.Now', 'can', 'get', 'Season', '4', 'premiere', 'date', 'please', 'Overall', 'A-']",My Little Pony: Equestria Girls

1650038,A3PJQ4742VN84H,B00CPTUN5G,"Hope this helps ""help""","[2, 3]","+Please Note: I purchased the digital copy of the movie.  Thus, this will be more along the lines of a movie review.  If I do purchase a physical DVD copy in the future, I will be sure to update and include my impressions of the DVD features and package.+CONTENT ISSUES:Parents and Guardians, don't worry.  You have nothing to worry about.  This show was especially made for kids to begin with (though I'm sure you can enjoy it, too ^_^ ).  No language issues, no innuendos...it's really safe and surprisingly wholesome.TO UNDERSTAND WHERE I'M COMING FROM...My Little Pony (MLP) has drawn in a wide array of people and observers that few recent shows have managed to pull in.  Some have more positive views on it (the MLP franchise as a whole) and others carry more negative perspectives.  Because of this wide spectrum of biases and perspectives this specific franchise has attracted,  I figured telling you a little bit of my position and angle on the show to help you decide how much salt to take with my words.  As far as MLP is concerned, I had avoided the show until a few weeks ago.  Nothing to do with a phobia or huge dislike...it just did not interest me at all.  One boring Saturday morning, I was eating breakfast while flipping through channels and came across 2 back-to-back episodes of MLP (one of the 2-parters).  There was nothing else on and I really wanted to eat, so I figured this was as good as anything else that was on at the time.  However, the episode blew me away, first, in it's smart music writing (I'm a musician) and musical timing, then sealed the deal with a very touching narrative that did pull on the heartstrings a little.  I watched a few more episodes to see if this was a one time thing, and while there were many episodes that I could totally pass over...there were many more that dealt with hard issues (like family legacy, loyalty, the hard consequences of gossip, making hard choices, dealing with sister or brother issues, etc.), had a good narrative, and excellent use of music.  The characters and character interplay is also very smart and charming.  It's use of cultural references is pretty amusing, as well (such as homages to Top Gun, a character named &#34;Dr. Whooves [take a guess who that one is based off of], and others).  Now, make no mistake, this is still a kids show...but it definitely carries more meat than many other shows, today, for kids...and can still be quite humorous, refreshing, and even enriching for older folks.  Fact is, there are tons of real world issues and situations that any person of any age can relate and connect to.  I'm no avid fan, but I do find the show charming and inspiring nonetheless.  The author C.S. Lewis did say that the more he grew older, the more and more he began to enjoy the fairytales and see their depth.BUT ANYWAYS, BACK TO THE MOVIE (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):Equestria Girls (EG), is a non-canon film in the MLP franchise.  Basically, it will have little to no effect on the main MLP show and narrative.  Still, I found it to be a very fun film that carried the same spirit of the show and was greatly enjoyable.  In effect, though, this movie did not feel like a movie so much as it did a really long and significantly more detailed tv episode (1 hour 13 minutes to be exact).ART STYLE:This was a make-or-break point for some folks.  But for me, I actually liked the world designs.  It really maintained the bright, pastel world of the MLP tv show.  I even liked the the character designs.  At first, the designs did seem a little weird to me (seeing them in static form like box art and so forth), but seeing it in the context of the show, it really worked out and grew on me.  It just helped to add one more layer of connection to the franchise.  The animation was also quite smooth and seemed a little more polished than usual.  Basically, from a visual standpoint, it was believable.PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):The progression of the plot was actually quite smooth.  The pacing was good and did not feel, too rushed.  The script writing was good, in my opinion...though there were a few weaker points, like some of the lines in the last 3rd of the film.  Also, I liked the concept and idea of the plot line.  True, it's nothing new, but it was well executed and well thought out...and besides, nothing is ever really new.  One thing I really enjoyed most, though was how they weaved many of the various prominent themes from the show into this one...especially the idea of Friendship.  Just like the show, they aren't too preachy or heavy handed about the good messages/lessons that often drive the show.  They clearly SHOW the lesson rather than rely on solely TELLING...and that makes a significant (and positive) difference.  Plus, the way they executed it was very touching.  I found myself feeling &#34;warm fuzzies&#34; at times, and in some of the more inspiring portions of the film, found myself tingling with excitement.  There were some good laughs and moments where I couldn't help but smile.  I love stories that can move your heart and inspire you to do greater things.  Again, this is still a kids show...so don't expect an &#34;adult&#34; narrative, at all.CHARACTERS:The human version of the ponies are true to character.  And you'll definitely recognize them not only by look, but by their demeanor.  Their interplay with each other was also charming and helped add to the narrative.MUSIC:The one thing that encouraged me to give MLP a chance weeks ago was the music.  MLP has been known for smart lyrics, good musical arrangements, and a varied genre style of music (from pop and rock, down to bluegrass and Disney'esque styled dramatic pieces).  In Equestria Girls, the style stays pretty much in the pop realm.  But the songs are still good, fitting, and augment what is happening on screen.  Best part...they are smoothly and &#34;believably&#34; worked in.  It's not like, &#34;let's stop and sing, now&#34;.  They professionally brought the music in a way that made you feel like it would have been wrong if they didn't.  That was my impression, anyways.FOR THE FANS:For you huge fans, you will definitely find a lot of amusing references as well as have a fun time playing &#34;guess-which-pony-that-human-is-based-off-of&#34;. Again, I'm not an avid fan so i definitely didn't catch it all, but I do remember a few things from what episodes I have seen.  I can only expect those of you who are quite fluent with MLP to appreciate these little extra details even more than a casual viewer like myself.ALL IN ALL:This was a fun and enjoyable film that gave me some food for thought. It's not the deepest film are the most ground breaking film, ever.  But it still has good sustenance and is a keeper in my book.  I'm also sure that there are several faults and weaknesses of this film.  In fact, many of the other reviewers have raised good points, too.  But for me, in this one instance, the good things about the film so greatly outweighed what weaknesses there may have been that I really don't remember any blaring blemishes.  Sure, there are preferential things on my part, but nothing that can really be considered a fair critique.  The one thing I would say, though, is you would appreciate this tons more if you were familiar with the MLP &#34;lore&#34; to even the smallest degree.  Jumping cold turkey into it may leave you confused.  The film does assume that you have at least a little familiarity with its world.  Still, this is definitely a film that can be fun for the whole family and a wonderful addition to the franchise.",5,Ok...I was pleasantly surprised...thoughts from a casual viewer.,1387843200,"12 24,

It's hardly perfect, but it's more than worth watching and has some great moments.The good:- The humor is great; pretty much all the scenes of Twilight trying to adjust to life in the human world are hilarious, and all of the character humor that the original show is so good at is there in full force.- All of the existing characters are carried over into the movie very well; they definitely still feel like themselves- The attention to detail: there's always something interesting going on in the background; most of the famous background ponies show up, and it goes to show that the writers were actively trying to make a quality product.The average:- The songs are catchy, but I don't think they're as good as the ones from the show itself.- The plot is interesting in theory, but not all the potential gets used and most of the story is a fairly banal high school drama type thing (until the end, which is epic).- The animation is definitely good, but the character designs are a bit off (the characters are all too skinny and the heads are too big in proportion to their bodies) and it knocks things down a bit.The not-so-good:- The movie's new characters are a bit lackluster.  Sunset Shimmer has an interesting backstory (Celestia's previous apprentice who fails and ran away to another world), but that largely gets passed over in favor of treating her as just a typical popular girl who's a jerk.  Flash Sentry has even less going for him; he's just sort of a generic ""cute guy"" character who contributes so little to the plot that he might as well not be there.Overall, the main plot is a bit shaky and typical at places, but the cast is strong enough to make it perfectly watchable.

This isn't a masterpiece among animated film, it's no Toy Story 3. There's no escaping the fact that it's a marketing ploy to sell dolls. That being said, this is a really entertaining movie. Even though there's a drastic change in the design of the ponies now that they're human, the personalities and quirks of the characters still remain in tact ( Twilight Sparkle as a human is adorable) and they're is a abundance of little nods to My little Pony's older fans so it is very true to it's source material. I think the humor and animation(while stiff at times) is a lot fun and very expressive. However, I do have problems with this movie. One problem being the music. Now, I'm a huge fan of Daniel Ingram, a lot of the songs he composes for television match the quality to that of a motion picture. In this movie is filled with very generic sounding pop music and only one of the tracks really stand out(those of you who watch the movie probably know which one I'm talking about) All in all this is really just a longer episode of My little pony.

In high school stories it's usually about trying to fit in but Twilight doesn't really care about fitting in. It's essentially an empire vs rebellion story in just a high school setting. Sure, our villain tries to use some high school drama stuff against Twilight but it's such a small portion of the film that I can't believe focus on it that much. When sunset shimmer learns that her cyber bullying plan doesn't stop Twilight she's off to her next plan. Boom Done and yet people still complain about it. There are some flawed moments but there not so bad to give it a one star rating People tend to see a school setting with humanized versions of the characters they know and love and make a bad assumption or go in to this movie with some biases. And for the record when I see this movie I don't see Hasbro trying to rival say Monster High or Bratz because those are shallow characters who seem to just care about 1 thing only and that's their looks. But I never get that impression for Equestria Girls. Sure not everybody needed to be in a skirt (especially AJ I picture in jeans as for RD SKORT NOT A SKIRT seems fitting. To me it shows athleticism and femininity.) I see the characters that we all know and love in a new setting. Plus the Bratz and Monster High characters always try to look sexy and the only scene I can consider to be sexy is when RD is shaving her hips in front of the camera THAT'S IT and if anyone else thinks otherwise then you know what...I can't help it if you have a dirty mind.

1650048,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B00CPTUN5G,Kenya Starflight,"[1, 1]","Call me one of the skeptics -- as something of a My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic fan, I had strong reservations regarding the upcoming ""Equestria Girls"" movie (though at first I misheard and thought it was going to be its own series, not simply a movie).  Humanized ponies?  That just sat wrong with me, given that I'd grown quite attached to the equine-run world of Equestria and its horse/Pegasus/unicorn inhabitants, and some leaked character designs only further turned me off.  It seemed as if Hasbro wanted to latch on to the same market occupied by Bratz and Monster High, and while I understand Hasbro has to make a buck somehow, the movie seemed like little more than a money-grab to me.  But I was determined to give it a chance before writing it off completely.I saw the movie for the first time this weekend (my sister, a bigger Pony fan than I am, sat me down and made me watch), and I have to take back a lot of what I thought.  While I do still prefer the characters as ponies, ""Equestria Girls"" is a fun and cute spinoff, and well worth a look if you're an MLP:FIM fan.WARNING:  This movie does contain some spoilers for the Season 3 finale of the show.  It's recommended that you finish watching the series up to the end of Season 3 before watching this movie.The movie picks up almost immediately after Twilight Sparkle's coronation as a princess, and she's still very unsure about her royal duties and her newly acquired wings.  But when a mysterious intruder steals her crown -- which contains her Element of Harmony, thereby rendering the other Elements useless -- Princess Celestia shows her a gateway to another world where she can face down the thief, a former student of Celestia named Sunset Shimmer, and recover her crown.  Traveling to said other world turns poor Twilight into a teenage girl (and her dragon companion Spike into an adorable puppy), and she finds herself in a strange alternate reality where Canterlot is a high school, familiar faces from Ponyville have become students, faculty, and storekeepers in a human city, and the human versions of her best friends are bitter enemies who hold grudges against each other.  Even worse, Sunset Shimmer is clearly the queen bee of the school, using manipulation and blackmail to further her own ends.  Twilight will have to reunite the human versions of her friends, beat Sunset Shimmer at her own game, and re-obtain her crown... all on a time limit, for the portal to this world will close within days and leave her stranded in the human world if she doesn't hurry...The plot is fairly clich&eacute;, combining elements of an alternate-universe plot (including finding doubles of people from one's own world and operating on a time limit with the threat of being trapped in the alternate reality) and a traditional high-school flick (the school dance, the cliques and popularity fights, the underdog trying to overthrow the most popular student in school).  But it manages to mesh these two normally-overdone plots well, and that helps it stand out from standard fare.  The fact that said plot is carried by familiar faces and characters doesn't hurt either, especially given that one character in particular is still trying to figure out the basics of walking upright and using hands instead of hooves in addition to trying to complete her quest.  In fact, some of the funniest moments come from Twilight's missteps as she has to learn that running on all fours and eating without using your hands are generally seen as bizarre among humans.The animation is as smooth and clean in the film as it is in the show, and despite taking place in our world it fits well with the colorful and inventive world of the show.  The Technicolor look to the humans can be a little off-putting at times, though -- it does help the viewer recognize a particular favorite pony in their human form, but it does make for some head-tiltingly strange moments -- wouldn't a purple-skinned human be a little strange in the human world?Speaking of recognizing favorite ponies, however, part of the fun of this film was finding favorite ponies from the show amongst the human populace of this world.  Not only are the Mane Six present, but Princess Celestia serves as the principal of the high school (with Princess Luna as vice-principal -- I didn't see Princess Cadence, however).  Cheerilee, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, the Great and Powerful Trixie, Snips and Snails, Mrs. Cake, and Big Macintosh also get appearances and lines, and sharp-eyed viewers might also see minor characters such as Photo Finish, the DJ pony, Featherweight, Time Turner (aka Doctor Hooves), and Derpy Hooves (aka Ditzy Doo) in various scenes.  And the show also introduces a few new characters, such as Sunset Shimmer and Flash Century, who I hope make appearances in the show proper.EDIT:  Forgot to mention -- the songs.  Just like in the show, the songs in this movie are quite catchy and fun.  My two nieces have many of the songs memorized and will sing along with the characters.  Hey Hasbro, release a MLP soundtrack already, will you?  I'll pay for it...While I still prefer to see the ponies as... well, ponies, this show was a fun departure from the norm, and a lot more fun and well-done than I was expecting.  Any fan of the show should give this a watch before dismissing it out of hand.  Who knows?  You might just love it.  And if nothing else, it's fun looking for various favorite ponies in their human forms.",4,Surprisingly well-done and fun spinoff of a favorite show,1380499200,"09 30, 2013",2013,5469,"['Call', 'one',

The unexpected older fanbase who call themsleves Bronies and/or Pegasisters have thirsted in their hearts for a full pledged MLP:FIM movie in theaters. Hasbro, the owners of the My Little Pony franchise, thought they knew their older fanbase's desires and released in select theaters the movie, ""My Little Pony: Equestria Girls"". However, they were soon dismayed at the low turn out of the movie since quite obviously the fans really wanted an all PONY movie. Realizing their epic fail, Hasbro has finally mustered their brain power and have givens fans what they truly wanted, ""My Little Pony: Fall"" the movie all Pony fans have ever dreamed about.You can preorder the movie now, before it even shows in theaters in glorious pony vision shattering high definition. Hasbro akin to their weird promotion of Equestria Girls, is doing the same for this pony movie. They are mixing up as you will, instead of the usual convention of movie screening then blu-ray release, they are doing it backwards by first releasing the movie on blu-ray and then screening it in movie theaters. The reason for this weird marking style? Hasbro wanted to give fans mental and physical preparation for seeing 100% ponies on the big screen by releasing the movie first in blu-ray and/or dvd.Now there are a lot of rumor going on about this movie some say Hasbro will have a full medical team in every theater to make sure know one doesn't die from sheer enjoyment and cuteness invoking heartattacks that ponies are known to give.5 film critics that were given a chance to view the movie first hand are already raving about this very first MLP:FIM movie: My Little Pony: Fall.Here are a few tidbits:Damn, these ponies know how to sing! Better than most pop stars of today. - Critic #1I didn't know ponies could make this 26 year old man cry so hard, *sniffle* - Critic #2Applejack's performance was heartwrenchly awesome as well as the whole of the mane 6 - Critic #3Everypony, somepony, anypony, helping hoof, brohoof, should be in everyone's lexicon - Critic #4Equestria Girls doesn't even come close, ""Boots on HOOVES.

For me Helping Twilight Get Her Crown was my favorite song in the movie. I don't think Sunset Shimmer's demon form is any worst that either Nightmare Moon in the MLP TV series or even the evil Fairy in Disney Sleeping Beauty turning into a dragon. How they deal with Sunset Shimmer remind me very much with how Nightmare Moon was dealt with.Hasbro did a good job picking the person who wrote some of the best and most popular episodes of the show to do the script of the movie. Its great watching Princess Twilight adjust to being human and the human world in the movie. Meeting Fluttershy for the first time is a revamp of their first meeting in Friendship is Magic season one. The movie has good anti bulling and believing in yourself theme to it without taking away the entertainment that made the series itself so great. I was surprise at Trixie's scene at the vending machine as before seeing the movie I was under the impression she was just in the back ground crowd to look for like many of the other characters.  The bits in the crystal empire with Flash Sentry was so good I'm sad he won't be part of series season 4.

I haven't had the movie but a few days and I have already watched it several times. It picks up not long after the end of season three ... in fact the first five minutes of the movie could have been a tag ending to the last episode of season three. Taking Twilight to the human world was necessary for this story to work. This is her journey of coming into her own as a Princess and becoming comfortable with her new self. All of the ""mane"" six personalities are there and nothing skips a beat while in the alternate human world. I really did not get the sense that this is just to sell or expand the toy line. I imagine that they will, it would be bad business not to. But, this movie doesn't come across as just a commercial for new products. The story told has a purpose and fits right in and flows from and back into the MLP:FIM world we are familiar with in a very natural, smooth way. The songs are good, the humor is classic cartoon slapstick with a touch of sarcasm placed sparingly here and there ... pretty much about the same as the show itself. There are a lot of nods to jokes and little things from the series here and there to look for as well as human versions of many of the background ponies that are fun to spot. The extras are also decent. The interviews with the creative staff were the best part of the extras for me. They shed light on how they came to this point and where they plan to go, the state of the series, the wide range of demographics the series reaches and that sort of stuff.

Equestria Girls, in spite of turning our favorite ponies into humans, keeps all the humor, all the charm and all the fun of the regular FiM series.Of course, this was originally made to run in select theatres, so you already know the production values are through the roof compared to the series. The animation is beautiful. They get so many different angles on the characters that the normal series wouldn't even attempt. The musical numbers are spot on (this from someone who usually can't stand musical numbers). Everything has that layer of polish that just makes it heads and shoulders above the normal series! And it's not like the normal series is too shabby either!I can understand why someone would have reservations about a My Little Pony movie that isn't primarily about ponies. But they are the same characters, just in a new setting. Give it half a chance.

Paige loves the ponies as much as I did and has the added fun of being able to watch them on TV and movies.It's funny the things that kids notice because as soon as the music started for MLP, Reed said ""what IS this song?"" The upbeat fun version of the title song got a facelift and is a great way to show that this movie is different than the regular show. It sets the tone for the movie.This movie is a classic tale of good versus evil when Princess Shimmer steals from Princess Twilight. (Who ever heard of a villain being named Princess Shimmer?) When they are turned into humans and attend the same school, they face additional challenges. My kids really got a kick out of seeing their ponies as humans. They were easily identifiable with their trademark colored hair and outfits.The ponies were a bit sassy and sarcastic which I don't really like as a mom. I don't think one character or movie will heavily influence my kids but you never know where they are going to pick up certain phrases or attitudes. They are at the age that they repeat everything to try it out for themselves and gauge my reaction. I also think maybe it was a little old for my four and five year olds as they haven't yet had any of these experiences in school yet and can't really relate.Nonetheless they enjoyed the movie and Paige especially was laughing a lot and understood the humor. While I also enjoyed the movie, as an adult I can discern better than my children what is appropriate so I think I'll put away My Little Pony Equestria Girls for a couple of years until they are older.",3,A Little Too Sassy,1375747200,"08 6, 2013",2013,1695,"['loved', 'My', 'Little', 'Pony', 'kid', 'extra', 'fun', 'share', 'movies', 'My', 'Little', 'Pony', 'Equestria', 'Girls', 'own', 'daughter', 'Paige', 'ponies', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'added', 'fun', 'being', 'able', 'watch', 'TV', 'movies.It', 'funny', 'things', 'kids', 'notice', 'as', 'soon', 'music', 'started', 'MLP', 'Reed', 'said', 'what', 'song', 'upbeat', 'fun', 'version', 'title', 'song', 'got', 'facelift', 'great', 'way', 'show', 'movie', 'different', 'regular', 'show', 'tone', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'classic', 'tale', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'when', 'Princess', 'Shimmer', 'steals', 'Princess', 'Twilight', 'Who', 'ever', 'heard', 'villain', 'being', 'named', 'Princess', 'Shimmer', 'When', 'are', 'turned', 'humans', 'attend', 'same', 'school', 'face', 'additional', 'challenges', 'kids', 'really', 'got', 'kick', 'seeing', 'ponies', 'humans', 'were', 'easily', 'identifiable', 'trademark', 'colored', 'hair', 'outfits.The', 'ponies', 'were', 'bit', 'sassy', 'sarcastic', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'mom', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'character', 'movie', 'will', 'heavily', 'influence', 'kids', 'never', 'know', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'pick', 'up', 'certain', 'phrases', 'attitudes', 'are', 'age', 'repeat', 'everything', 'try', 'out', 'gauge', 'reaction', 'also', 'think', 'maybe', 'was', 'little', 'old', 'four', 'five', 'year', 'olds', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'had', 'experiences', 'school', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'relate.Nonetheless', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Paige', 'especially', 'was', 'laughing', 'lot', 'understood', 'humor', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'adult', 'can', 'discern', 'better', 'children', 'what', 'appropriate', 'think', ""'ll"", 'put', 'away', 'My', 'Little', 'Pony', 'Equestria', 'Girls', 'couple', 'years', 'are', 'older']",My Little Pony: Equestria Girls
