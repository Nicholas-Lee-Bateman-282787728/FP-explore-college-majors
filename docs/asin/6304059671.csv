A stage coach carrying Dillon's daughter and her husband, an affable salesman, and a mother with a 15 and a 9 year old son, is chased and robbed by a band of five outlaws, who wound Dillon's son-in-law and shoot the mother. We learn later that these bandits had robbed a train and taken $60,000, which raises the question, why bother with the small pickings of a stage coach robbery. Dillon owns a ranch nearby and the survivors are taken there, where the mother dies from her wounds. Her eldest son, although only 15, leaves at night to find the five killers and avenge his mother, leaving his 9 year old brother to grieve both the loss of his mother and his abandonment. Dillon and the salesman feel they must help the 15 year old who will certainly be killed without their help, and they pursue him. Predictably, the boy is almost killed, but saved by a strange Indian wearing glasses and later by Dillon and the salesman. During various adventures, the salesman shows himself to be quite good at handling a gun and fighting with his hands, but he refuses to tell Dillon about his background.",5,A mature Dillon appears in a good mature film,1294012800,"01 3, 2011",2011,1247,"['Gunsmoke', 'films', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'retired', 'aged', 'Marshal', 'produced', 'James', 'Arness', 'have', 'good', 'mature', 'stories', 'are', 'means', 'grade', 'B', 'westerns', 'stage', 'coach', 'carrying', 'Dillon', 'daughter', 'husband', 'affable', 'salesman', 'mother', '15', '9', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'chased', 'robbed', 'band', 'five', 'outlaws', 'who', 'wound', 'Dillon', 'son-in-law', 'mother', 'learn', 'later', 'bandits', 'had', 'robbed', 'train', 'taken', '60,000', 'question', 'why', 'bother', 'small', 'pickings', 'stage', 'coach', 'robbery', 'Dillon', 'ranch', 'nearby', 'survivors', 'are', 'taken', 'there', 'where', 'mother', 'wounds', 'eldest', 'son', 'only', '15', 'night', 'find', 'five', 'killers', 'avenge', 'mother', 'leaving', '9', 'year', 'old', 'brother', 'grieve', 'loss', 'mother', 'abandonment', 'Dillon', 'salesman', 'feel', 'must', 'help', '15', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'killed', 'help', 'pursue', 'Predictably', 'boy', 'almost', 'killed', 'saved', 'strange', 'Indian', 'wearing', 'glasses', 'later', 'Dillon', 'salesman', 'various', 'adventures', 'salesman', 'be', 'quite', 'good', 'handling', 'gun', 'fighting', 'hands', 'tell', 'Dillon', 'background']",Gunsmoke:One Man's Justice VHS

This contributed to its classic and classyquality. The final made-for-TV Gunsmoke movie changed this with therecurring theme that retiree Matt Dillon was approaching the thresholdof the 20th century. This is acceptable because, after all, Wyatt Earplived well into the 1920s. Signs of modernity included eyeglasseson an reservation Indian, a victrola in a baudyhouse,turmoil in Revolutionary Mexico, a bandit leader who perhaps escapedfamine in Europe and not an American civil war survivor. But most of all,a lever-action shotgun that changed the odds in the final gunfight.The signs of change added to this movie, like theBicycle Scene in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.""Matt Dillon is depicted as becoming a successful cattle rancher after startinghis retirement as a humble trapper in the first Gunsmoke movie""Return To Dodge.""Nostalgic baby boomers who enjoy the legendary Gunsmoke series mightbe inspired by how the legendary US marshal made a second careerin an age before pensions and social security.It is extraordinary when fictional characters take on a life in ourcollective imaginations. One can think of Don Quixote in Spain,Sherlock Holmes in London, Evangeline in Louisiana, Huckleberry Finnon the Mississippi River, Captain Nemo on the ocean floor.Matt Dillon and his friends in Dodge City, Kansas, have achievedthe same iconic stature",5,A unique theme for a Gunsmoke episode,1190073600,"09 18, 2007",2007,1453,"['hundreds', 'episodes', 'Gunsmoke', 'Dodge', 'City', 'seemed', 'be', 'atime', 'capsule', 'unchanging', 'contributed', 'classic', 'classyquality', 'final', 'made-for-TV', 'Gunsmoke', 'movie', 'changed', 'therecurring', 'theme', 'retiree', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'was', 'approaching', 'thresholdof', '20th', 'century', 'acceptable', 'Wyatt', 'Earplived', 'well', '1920s', 'Signs', 'modernity', 'included', 'eyeglasseson', 'reservation', 'Indian', 'victrola', 'baudyhouse', 'turmoil', 'Revolutionary', 'Mexico', 'bandit', 'leader', 'who', 'perhaps', 'escapedfamine', 'Europe', 'not', 'American', 'civil', 'war', 'survivor', 'most', 'lever-action', 'shotgun', 'changed', 'odds', 'final', 'gunfight.The', 'signs', 'change', 'added', 'movie', 'theBicycle', 'Scene', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'depicted', 'becoming', 'successful', 'cattle', 'rancher', 'startinghis', 'retirement', 'humble', 'trapper', 'first', 'Gunsmoke', 'movie', 'Return', 'Dodge', 'Nostalgic', 'baby', 'boomers', 'who', 'enjoy', 'legendary', 'Gunsmoke', 'series', 'mightbe', 'inspired', 'how', 'legendary', 'US', 'marshal', 'made', 'second', 'careerin', 'age', 'pensions', 'social', 'security.It', 'extraordinary', 'when', 'fictional', 'characters', 'take', 'life', 'ourcollective', 'imaginations', 'One', 'can', 'think', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'Spain', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'London', 'Evangeline', 'Louisiana', 'Huckleberry', 'Finnon', 'Mississippi', 'River', 'Captain', 'Nemo', 'ocean', 'floor.Matt', 'Dillon', 'friends', 'Dodge', 'City', 'Kansas', 'have', 'achievedthe', 'same', 'iconic', 'stature']",Gunsmoke:One Man's Justice VHS
399117,AFU8Q0K8UR1Z4,6304059671,Philos,"[0, 0]","The only question I had concerning the 4 films following the ""Return To Dodge,"" was - why would Matt choose to live in the Tombstone - Tuscon area of Arizona? The only answer I could come up with is because the silly scriptwriters decided to put him there for their own purposes. I could not otherwise imagine why Matt would of himself make such a decision - after having spent 20 years as Marshall of Dodge City, decide to ""retire"" in what was possibly the most lawless area of the US? Well. that was not the only question that burned in my mind - I was also asking myself. ""Why aren't Chester & Festus apppearing somewhere in these 5 films?"" Oh well, I am grateful for these films, each of which is excellent & worth 5 stars & have greatly appreciated & enjoyed the journey I took after acquiring DVDs of the 20 years in Dodge City when Matt looked oh so young to the final film made, ""One Man's Justice,"" when Matt looked oh so old. In a Q&A; page about this movie online, this comment is made about it: "".... a scarf hid Arness' neck, probably to hide his age. Makeup has difficulty covering an aged neck."" Well makeup sure couldn't do much to hide Matt's age reflected in his face.As long as there are DVDs available of Gunsmoke & these 5 films, Matt Dillon & his friends will ride on.
