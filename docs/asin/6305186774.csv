453974,AGEIT17HENDIS,6305186774,Alfred Johnson,"[4, 6]","I have reviewed Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky's definitive three-volume work The History of the Russian Revolution that covers this same topic elsewhere in this space. (See April 2006 archives.) Trotsky's work gives a sweeping literary expression to the ebb and flow of the revolution much as the film under review, October 1917, does so cinematically under Eisenstein's masterful direction. I noted in the Trotsky review that his work represented partisan history at its best. One does not and should not, at least in this day in age, ask historians to be `objective'. One simply asks that the historian present his or her narrative and analysis and get out of the way. That same standard is also applicable to the film director Eisenstein's work to which he was commissioned in order to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Russian Revolution in 1927. Although Eisenstein has taken the usual cinematic license in presenting his epic that one has come to expect from that medium and furthermore was working in the period of the Stalinist consolidation of political power it is no the worst political documentary produced in that era, not by a long shot.Eisenstein was the master of montage, stage direction and reenactment of historical scenes. That skill does not fail him here. In scenes such as Lenin's literally whirlwind arrival at Finland Station from exile in April 1917, the brutal response of the nefarious Provisional Government during the 'July Days', the Petrograd proletariat's response to the counter-revolutionary attempt to seize power by General Kornilov and the events surrounding the storming of the Winter Palace and the transfer of political power to the Soviets Eisenstein uses every trick of the cinematic trade. It shows in the faces of the actors used to portray the various participants. One may criticize this work as being too didactic in its portrayal of the `good' and `bad' guys but my friends that is what this film is all about. It is a propaganda film made in the 1920's and reflects the state of the art and the state of working class politics. The hoary-handed Petrograd worker, the star-struck Siberian peasant and the steely-eyed Kronstadt sailor were not society's `beautiful' people. And that is exactly the point. The intent of the revolution was to turn that world upside down with the forces that the Bolsheviks had to work with, warts and all.I have endlessly pointed out that the October Revolution was the definitive political event of the 20th century. The resulting change in the balance of world power with the demise of the Soviet Union in the 1990's is beginning to look like a definitive political event for the 21st century. I have urged those interested in the fight for socialism to read, yes to read, about the Russian Revolution in order to learn some lessons from that experience. Trotsky's history is obviously a good place to start for a pro-Bolshevik overview. If you are looking for a general history of the revolution or want an analysis of what the revolution meant for the fate of various nations after World War I or its affect on world geopolitics look elsewhere. E.H. Carr's History of the Russian Revolution offers an excellent multi-volume set that tells that story through the 1920's. Or if you want to know what the various parliamentary leaders, both bourgeois and Soviet, were thinking and doing from a moderately leftist viewpoint read Sukhanov's Notes on the Russian Revolution. For a more journalistic account John Reed's classic Ten Days That Shook the World is invaluable. If, however, you want a quick overview of the revolution and view the film with that purpose in mind then Serge Eisenstein's masterpiece is not a bad place to start.",4,THE DEFINITIVE EVENT OF THE 20TH CENTURY,1188864000,"09 4, 2007",2007,3726,"['have', 'reviewed', 'Russian', 'revolutionary', 'Leon', 'Trotsky', 'definitive', 'three-volume', 'work', 'History', 'Russian', 'Revolution', 'same', 'topic', 'elsewhere', 'space', 'See', 'April', '2006', 'archives', 'Trotsky', 'work', 'sweeping', 'literary', 'expression', 'ebb', 'flow', 'revolution', 'much', 'film', 'review', 'October', '1917', 'so', 'cinematically', 'Eisenstein', 'masterful', 'direction', 'noted', 'Trotsky', 'review', 'work', 'represented', 'partisan', 'history', 'best', 'One', 'not', 'should', 'not', 'least', 'day', 'age', 'ask', 'historians', 'be', 'objective', 'One', 'simply', 'historian', 'present', 'narrative', 'analysis', 'get', 'way', 'same', 'standard', 'also', 'applicable', 'film', 'director', 'Eisenstein', 'work', 'was', 'commissioned', 'order', 'commemorate', '10th', 'anniversary', 'Russian', 'Revolution', '1927', 'Eisenstein', 'taken', 'usual', 'cinematic', 'license', 'presenting', 'epic', 'one', 'come', 'expect', 'medium', 'furthermore', 'was', 'working', 'period', 'Stalinist', 'consolidation', 'political', 'power', 'worst', 'political', 'documentary', 'produced', 'era', 'not', 'long', 'shot.Eisenstein', 'was', 'master', 'montage', 'stage', 'direction', 'reenactment', 'historical', 'scenes', 'skill', 'not', 'fail', 'here', 'scenes', 'such', 'Lenin', 'literally', 'whirlwind', 'arrival', 'Finland', 'Station', 'exile', 'April', '1917', 'brutal', 'response', 'nefarious', 'Provisional', 'Government', ""'July"", 'Days', 'Petrograd', 'proletariat', 'response', 'counter-revolutionary', 'attempt', 'seize', 'power', 'General', 'Kornilov', 'events', 'surrounding', 'storming', 'Winter', 'Palace', 'transfer', 'political', 'power', 'Soviets', 'Eisenstein', 'trick', 'cinematic', 'trade', 'actors', 'used', 'portray', 'various', 'participants', 'One', 'may', 'criticize', 'work', 'being', 'too', 'didactic', 'portrayal', 'good', 'bad', 'guys', 'friends', 'what', 'film', 'propaganda', 'film', 'made', '1920', 'state', 'art', 'state', 'working', 'class', 'politics', 'hoary-handed', 'Petrograd', 'worker', 'star-struck', 'Siberian', 'peasant', 'steely-eyed', 'Kronstadt', 'sailor', 'were', 'not', 'society', 'beautiful', 'people', 'exactly', 'point', 'intent', 'revolution', 'was', 'turn', 'world', 'upside', 'down', 'forces', 'Bolsheviks', 'had', 'work', 'warts', 'all.I', 'have', 'endlessly', 'pointed', 'out', 'October', 'Revolution', 'was', 'definitive', 'political', 'event', '20th', 'century', 'resulting', 'change', 'balance', 'world', 'power', 'demise', 'Soviet', 'Union', '1990', 'beginning', 'look', 'definitive', 'political', 'event', '21st', 'century', 'have', 'urged', 'interested', 'fight', 'socialism', 'read', 'yes', 'read', 'Russian', 'Revolution', 'order', 'learn', 'lessons', 'experience', 'Trotsky', 'history', 'obviously', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'pro-Bolshevik', 'overview', 'are', 'looking', 'general', 'history', 'revolution', 'want', 'analysis', 'what', 'revolution', 'meant', 'fate', 'various', 'nations', 'World', 'War', 'affect', 'world', 'geopolitics', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'E.H.', 'Carr', 'History', 'Russian', 'Revolution', 'excellent', 'multi-volume', 'set', 'story', '1920', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'various', 'parliamentary', 'leaders', 'bourgeois', 'Soviet', 'were', 'thinking', 'doing', 'moderately', 'leftist', 'viewpoint', 'read', 'Sukhanov', 'Notes', 'Russian', 'Revolution', 'more', 'journalistic', 'account', 'John', 'Reed', 'classic', 'Ten', 'Shook', 'World', 'invaluable', 'however', 'want', 'quick', 'overview', 'revolution', 'view', 'film', 'purpose', 'mind', 'then', 'Serge', 'Eisenstein', 'masterpiece', 'not', 'bad', 'place', 'start']",October Ten Days That Shook the World

However, it was commissioned as a propoganda piece so that the only ""character"" that stands out is Lenin, who, of course is idolized. There are the populace and soldiers who are on the side of the Bolsheviks but they are basically nameless and faceless as is the other side (mensheviks).

Certainly, not as morally disturbing as Triumph of the Will (which it influenced) but still, a film made to support a government sanctioned point of view.

453976,A1LQLQUJJZUBTC,6305186774,Jeff  Farrow,"[1, 1]","I agree with the reviewer who wrote that OKTOBER would be a difficult film to follow if the viewer didn't have an historical grasp of the events depicted. I have an above average knowledge of the events because I made a point of studying them. Nonetheless, private studies aside, there were events depicted in OKTOBER that left me feeling a little confused.OKTOBER is undeniably a straight-up propaganda film--and (Stalinist)revisionist propaganda at that. For example there are 2 scenes that include Leon Trotsky, but he is never identified (Unlike Lenin, of course.) I could identify him because 1. The actor playing the role was pointedly Semitic to promote the anti-racist program of early Bolshevism (Marxist-Leninism). 2. The 2 scenes illustrated tactical discussions in which the real Trotsky advocated the ideas expressed in the (silent) movie. They would mean nothing to people unfamiliar with the polemical clash between Lenin & Trotsky.I also agree that some of the metaphoric imagery is murky or down right incomprehensible. For example, the role of women and ethnic minorities is stressed in the film in oder to, again, illustrate typical social liberating views of early Bolshevism. However, even these straight forward images become blurred with the obviously abundant editing of the movie. At one point one is left wondering if a Lesbian theme is being promoted--and at that point in time, it's not impossible that that were the case! But was it?Regardless of these & other mysteries, I gave the film 4 Stars because it is an immensely important acrhival document and, despite Stalinist ""tinkering,"" remains a cinematic milestone & masterpiece in its own light.IVAN THE TERRIBLE remains my Eisenstein personal favorite.I plan to write a more indepth review for Parallel Perspectives (see my profile for link.)Eisenstein - The Sound Years (Ivan the Terrible Parts 1 & 2, Alexander Nevsky) - Criterion CollectionBattleship Potemkin (The Ultimate Edition) (2pc) (Full B&W;)",4,All Shook Up (On the Cutting Room Floor),1284595200,"09 16, 2010",2010,1986,"['agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'wrote', 'OKTOBER', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'film', 'follow', 'viewer', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'historical', 'grasp', 'events', 'depicted', 'have', 'above', 'average', 'knowledge', 'events', 'made', 'point', 'studying', 'Nonetheless', 'private', 'studies', 'aside', 'were', 'events', 'depicted', 'OKTOBER', 'left', 'feeling', 'little', 'confused.OKTOBER', 'undeniably', 'straight-up', 'propaganda', 'film', 'Stalinist', 'revisionist', 'propaganda', 'example', 'are', '2', 'scenes', 'include', 'Leon', 'Trotsky', 'never', 'identified', 'Lenin', 'course', 'could', 'identify', 'because', '1', 'actor', 'playing', 'role', 'was', 'pointedly', 'Semitic', 'promote', 'anti-racist', 'program', 'early', 'Bolshevism', 'Marxist-Leninism', '2', '2', 'scenes', 'illustrated', 'tactical', 'discussions', 'real', 'Trotsky', 'advocated', 'ideas', 'expressed', 'silent', 'movie', 'would', 'mean', 'nothing', 'people', 'unfamiliar', 'polemical', 'clash', 'Lenin', 'Trotsky.I', 'also', 'agree', 'metaphoric', 'imagery', 'murky', 'down', 'right', 'incomprehensible', 'example', 'role', 'women', 'ethnic', 'minorities', 'stressed', 'film', 'oder', 'again', 'illustrate', 'typical', 'social', 'liberating', 'views', 'early', 'Bolshevism', 'However', 'even', 'straight', 'forward', 'become', 'blurred', 'obviously', 'abundant', 'editing', 'movie', 'one', 'point', 'one', 'left', 'wondering', 'Lesbian', 'theme', 'being', 'promoted', 'point', 'time', 'not', 'impossible', 'were', 'case', 'was', 'Regardless', 'other', 'mysteries', 'gave', 'film', '4', 'Stars', 'immensely', 'important', 'acrhival', 'document', 'Stalinist', 'tinkering', 'cinematic', 'milestone', 'masterpiece', 'own', 'light.IVAN', 'THE', 'TERRIBLE', 'Eisenstein', 'personal', 'favorite.I', 'plan', 'write', 'more', 'indepth', 'review', 'Parallel', 'Perspectives', 'see', 'profile', 'link', 'Eisenstein', 'Sound', 'Years', 'Ivan', 'Terrible', 'Parts', '1', '2', 'Alexander', 'Nevsky', 'Criterion', 'CollectionBattleship', 'Potemkin', 'Ultimate', 'Edition', '2pc', 'Full', 'B', 'W']",October Ten Days That Shook the World

Alexander Nevsky is a classic and would probably be more of a classic if it were American.  Battleship Potemkin is pretty good and has some stuff that gets ripped off by Hollywood.  So I thought I would give this one a try.I really wanted to like this movie.  It's about the Russian Revolution but for me it lays things on a little too thick.  I could only get to about half way through the movie (as the horse is hanging off the bridge is where I stop).  Excellent cinematography and music but I couldn't watch more of it.

On one hand, they're done absolutely brilliantly done in ways that take one's breath away; on the other hand, how much credit can you give to a movie that is pure propaganda, especially propaganda for something the reviewer doesn't agree with?This ""realistic re-enactment"" of the events of October 25th, 1917, is actually anything but realism.  Instead, it is a harrowing and amazing Romantic experience.  This is not to say it's bad--it's brilliant!  The direction and editing on this film are much more refined than Eisenstein's previous and much-more-heralded film, Brenonsets Potyemkin (Battleship Potemkin), and it has a whole lot more symbolism and focus on literary devices.  His fast-paced cutting is not as disjunctive as previously; instead, it works to shock the viewer with the juxtapositions.
