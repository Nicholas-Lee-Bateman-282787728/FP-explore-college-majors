John Ritter and Polly Draper are exceptional in this story.  As a happily married career women whose husband walks out after she refuses to abort their baby, Polly Draper plays the character of Adrienne just right, not to weepy but strong enough to stand on her own decision and go on with life.  John Ritter's character comes into her life and as the loving father of two sons from a previous marriage he knows exactly how to win her over and become the husband she deserves and the father her baby needs.",5,Love lost and found,1196294400,"11 29, 2007",2007,643,"['Love', 'lost', 'then', 'found', 'unexpected', 'place', 'movie', 'have', 'loved', 'Danielle', 'Steel', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Polly', 'Draper', 'are', 'exceptional', 'story', 'happily', 'married', 'career', 'women', 'husband', 'out', 'abort', 'baby', 'Polly', 'Draper', 'character', 'Adrienne', 'just', 'right', 'not', 'weepy', 'strong', 'enough', 'stand', 'own', 'decision', 'go', 'life', 'John', 'Ritter', 'character', 'life', 'loving', 'father', 'two', 'sons', 'previous', 'marriage', 'exactly', 'how', 'win', 'over', 'become', 'husband', 'father', 'baby', 'needs']",N/A

WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS THERE IS OR WAS A SHOW IN THE UK CALLED HEARTBEAT, CAUSING SOME CONFUSION WITH VIEWERS WHO THOUGHT WHEN THEY BOUGHT THIS MOVIE, THEY WERE GETTING THE DAILY SHOW THAT IS SHOWN IN THE UK. ""HEARTBEAT"" STARRING JOHN RITTER AND POLLY DRAPER WAS RELEASED IN THE EARLY 90'S, BASED ON A NOVEL WRITTEN BY DANIELLE STEEL, WITH THE SAME TITLE. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SINCE THIS MOVIE IS ADVERTISED SPECIFICALLY AS DANIELLE STEEL'S HEARTBEAT, THAT SHOULD HAVE ELIMINATED ANY CONFUSION UP FRONT. TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE DANIELLE STEEL DOESN'T HAVE A DAILY SERIES BASED ON ANY OF HER NOVELS. I DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT ALL OF HER WORKINGS, BUT SO FAR I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. I'M A BIG FAN OF HERS, HOWEVER I DON'T LIKE ALL OF HER BOOKS OR MOVIES, THOUGH I DID/DO ENJOY HEARTBEAT, WHAT THE SELLERS ARE ASKING FOR IS RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE.

John Ritter and Polly Draper displayed such a warm chemistry and you just rooted for them to find their way to eachother despite the many hurdles they faced. Eventhough I've seen this movie several times over the years, I would watch it everytime it would air on Lifetime. It's just the kind of movie you could kick back, relax and shed a few tears of happiness at the end!!!
