Rather it was very obvious from the first 15 minutes, that it was  Sisto reading lines pretending to be Jesus. In a way it was very liturgical  and dogmatic and...well boring. But I watched it anyway because I love all  movies portraying the most fabulous spiritual masters of all time. I will  say that Messing, surprinsingly enough acted very well in her role as Mary  Magdalene...in fact she was the only convincing actor in the movie. I will  also say that I loved the idea of how they portrayed Satan. All too often  Jesus movies leave out the temptation story...yet it is a wonderful and  highly symbolic of Jesus the man...turning into Jesus the Christ by  resisting the lower self.  So any library needs this movie just for the  sake of having it. Beyond that, if you want quality Jesus movie with a  quality character portrayal of Christ please, I urge you to buy &quot;Mary,  the Mother of Jesus.&quot; Christian Bale portrays Jesus...what an actor!

But Jeremy Sisto's warmly existential portrayal of Jesus is surprisingly excellent ""PM""rendering of the Greatest Story ever Told.Jacqueline Bisset's interpretation of Blessed Mother Mary is particularly noteworthy  anticipating the peerless performance by Maia Morgenstern in THE PASSION. Jeroen Krabbe is superb as Satan; presented...perhaps again pre-figuring Mel Gibson's hermaphodite Lucifer...as alternately female seductress(anti-mother),and bitterly sardonic Political anti-Christ.[The episode of ""The Three Temptations in the Wilderness""...apparently much influenced by Dostoyevsky's ""Parable of the Grand Inquisitor""...is singularly effective and perhaps the film's most memorable,dramatic confrontation between ULTIMATE GOOD and EVIL.]Untypically,Gary Oldman is disappointing as a campish gloating, Governor Pontius Pilate(his SPQR lackey--whose name I forget--is  portrayed as obsequious clown). The rest of the ensemble cast is good with exception of Judas,who is unconvincingly characterized as petulant, rather than angst-ridden,disillusioned--or simply faithless--conspirator-traitor...This telling of JESUS...originally presented in Spring of 2000 as TV mini-series...does succeed well because Jeremy Sisto's acting is CHRIST-like. Reviews demonstrate it will...as always apparently...offend some Fundamentalists who cannot truly imagine real humanity--or a sense of humor--in THE LORD.(At this point--AD 2005--how can anyone not believe Jesus has an incredible sense of Mercy-tinged humor?).Franco Zeffirelli's epic remains peerless.

190895,A141HP4LYPWMSR,1573629219,Brian E. Erland,"[4, 7]","Jeremy Sisto portrays an immensely friendly, likeable Jesus in the movie `Jesus', one of most recent cinematic renditions of the life of Christ. He's good looking, quite funny and all the girls love him, who wouldn't want to follow him? Add the very lovely Jacqueline Bisset to the cast playing his Mother Mary, the extremely talented Gary Oldman in the role of Pontius Pilate and Debra Messing as Mary Magdalene and you're set for a very enjoyable evening in front of the television set.I love the clever manner in which Satan was portrayed. Sometimes as a seductive female in a provocative red dress, other times as a well-groomed, clean shaven 21st century businessman in a black suit. Some might consider this blasphemous, I see it as an impressive use of artistic expression particularly with the latter to the two portrayals. This unconventional choice of having Satan appear in modern day apparel was a stroke of genius and a fascinating use of poetic license. What a clever use of costume to visually express how time constraints simply don't exist in the spiritual dimension.This concept of the illusory nature of time is also found at the beginning of the film where we get a glimpse into the dreamlife of the carpenter from Galilee and see visions of things to come. Jesus dreams of a future Holy War with combatants proclaiming his name as justification for their murderous acts and another more mechanized battle further into the distant future where a dying solider calls out his name with his last breath. In my opinion it's the inclusion of these unexpected and highly original variances from the original storyline that make this film such a wonderfully refreshing viewing experience.The choice of David O'Hara to play the part of John the Baptist was a bad decision. I found it a bit disconcerting listening to a first century Jewish prophet proclaiming the Kingdom of God is at hand with a distinct Irish accent. I also thought Jesus' baptism at the Jordan was a little overdone. Minor concerns however for an otherwise wonderfully original retelling of the Jesus story.Inventive - Imaginative - Thoughtful - Joyous!

190896,ADES8B01WRPI3,1573629219,"Bryan E. Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[10, 18]","I never saw this before 2006, but JESUS: THE GREATEST STORY OF ALL TIME was a TV mini-series from the year 2000. I was surprised that a famous Lee Ann Rhimes song and video were made to promote this mini-series. I had heard this song on the radio, but I had no idea it was made specifically for this project.The story is about 75% Biblically accurate, and 15% interesting, fictional fabrication, with the last 10% as fictional but destructive teachings, many of which are more prevalent in our society since the bestselling book of lies, THE DA VINCI CODE, which came out years after this mini-series was made, and this DVD was released.At first, I thought the actor chosen to portray Jesus was miscast. He looks more like a suburban college kid than a thirty year old Jewish man from 2,000 years ago. Though I still don't like their choice in casting, I must say that the acting in this mini-series is pretty good, sometimes very good. All the actors interact well, and are usually very interesting to watch.The main faults I find with this DVD is in the story writing. I don't mind that they fictionalize Jesus' relationship with Mary's husband, Joseph; and they make a nice, wholesome relationship between the two. But they go overboard in other aspects, which have since become part of the national debate, in the last few years, concerning Jesus, and in light of such bogus religious items as THE DA VINCI CODE, etc.They screw up some points that could have easily been done right. When Jesus asks John the Baptist to baptize Jesus, John resists because he is not worthy, in the Bible version, at least. In this mini-series, they have rewritten that. Stupid.I don't like that they show a lot of Jesus' home life with Joseph and Mary, but do not show Jesus' brothers and sisters, who are mentioned in the Bible! Jesus had siblings, in the Bible.They show Joseph and Jesus being friends with Lazarus, Martha , and Mary, but they take another incredible liberty by supposedly having Mary fall in love with Jesus and want to marry him, to which Jesus must let her down easy. What a waste of screen time, and it adds a weird dimension to the way Jesus is friends with all three, as the Bible portrays it.I also don't like that Jesus seems to be wishy-washy about who He is and what He has to do for His mission. This improves as the story gets closer to the end, but it's too little, too late.A major bogus storyline here is that Pontius Pilate plots to have Jesus killed and to manipulate the situation to make it look like the local Jewish leaders came up with the idea. This definitely contradicts the Bible, and it adds nothing to the story.Jacqueline Bissett is great as mother Mary. Debra Messing, (better known as a willful disgrace on the WILL & GRACE homosexual propaganda sitcom), is good as Mary Magdalene, but doesn't get to do too much with the character. At one point they have her saying if she were a man, she would be the most loyal disciple, which unfortunately plays exactly into the DA VINCI CODE conundrum of lies and deception concerning Magdalene.I was going to give this DVD a 3 star rating, but after considering some of the other reviewers viewpoints, I agree that some of the misrepresentations in this mini-series will result in further muddying the waters, and confusing the true Bible story, in the minds of too many Biblically illiterate viewers, who too often only learn Bible stories from TV shows such as this, instead of the real deal as it appears in the Bible, itself. A shame.If you truly know the story as the Bible tells it, then you may well enjoy many of the scenes in this film.

In one scene, Jesus is drinking water from a well and his disiples come to join him, only to be welcomed by Jesus splashing them with the water playfully and having a water fight with them.  It shows Jesus laughing and having fun in this movie, just as Im positive he did in real life.  Some people may not agree with me in saying that this was how Jesus was.  But think about it, yes there were times when Jesus was teaching and serious, but Im sure he had fun as well.  And where in the Bible is it a sin to laugh?  In another scene, Jesus is picking his 12 disiples and calls out James and John, and calls them sons of thunder as he does in the Bible, but he does it in a kidding, playful manner.This film shows is probably the closest to how Jesus was in real life.

190902,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,1573629219,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[2, 3]","Around the year 2000, Jeremy Sisto (currently upholding the law as Detective Cyrus Lupo on ""Law And Order"") portrayed Jesus Christ. The CBS miniseries ""Jesus"" was an earnest, admirable attempt to tell Jesus' story to a mass audience; instead of ""preaching to the choir"" (i.e. those who are already Christians). As such, this is one version of ""the greatest story ever told"" that, thankfully, does not come at you like a dry, didactic sermon from the pulpit.Jeremy Sisto  sensibly underplays the role of Jesus. He is still charismatic and appealing/alluring, but quietly so.  He does get angry in the Temple and  is clearly conflicted in the garden just prior to Judas' betrayal.  But, for the most part,  Sisto goes about Jesus'  miracles, mission, and ministry in a fairly mellow fashion. The miniseries may have raised some eyebrows (and obviously made some Amazon reviewers angry) by focusing on Jesus' humanity rather than his Divinity. A Christian friend of mine says that Jesus was ""divinity personified."" There is some suggestion that He may have ""feelings"" for a certain ""Mary Of Bethany,"" but He tells her he can not marry her just before embarking on His mission. Jesus remains chaste and pure. I can not think of anything in Suzette Couture's teleplay that would be offensive to anyone. I'm not a Christian, (no movie or church service will make me have a ""religious experience""; although I'm happy this movie affected at least one Amazon reviewer that way) so I don't care whether the film follows the Bible (or any individual interpretation of it) or not. I view ""Jesus"" as an historical/biographical film rather than a ""religious"" one. There is nothing here to be offended by or get up in arms about. To put it simply, ""Jesus"" is not ""controversial"" like ""The Last Temptation Of Christ"" or ""Passion Of The Christ.""I do want a movie to tell a story in a compelling fashion with solid performances; and this one does.Director Roger Young keeps the pace of this nearly  three hour film moving along nicely.  (Originally, this mini-series was shown on TV  in two parts. Oddly, later on, only Part Two was rebrodcast on TV. Seen as a complete film on DVD,  it is  brisk and interesting. It's hard to believe the running time is 2 Hours, 54 Minutes).The scenes where Jeroen Krabbe as Satan tempts Jesus and taunts Him with visions of the future are quite good. The Crucifixion, though not as graphic or gory as ""The Passion Of The Christ,"" is still terrible to watch. The final scenes of Jesus' Resurrection and Ascension are suitably moving and hopeful.Overall, the casting is interesting, to say the least. Debra Messing (""Will And Grace,"" ""The Starter Wife"") is Mary Magdaline. Jacqueline Bisset and Armin Mueller-Stahl are Jesus' ""earthly"" parents Mary and Joseph. Gary Oldman (""Dracula,"" ""Sid And Nancy,"" ""Air Force One,"" ""Prick Up Your Ears"") is, of course, perfectly cast as Pontius Pilot.",4,"JEREMY AS ""JESUS.""",1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,2904,"['year', '2000', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'currently', 'upholding', 'law', 'Detective', 'Cyrus', 'Lupo', 'Law', 'Order', 'portrayed', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'CBS', 'Jesus', 'was', 'earnest', 'admirable', 'attempt', 'tell', 'Jesus', 'story', 'mass', 'audience', 'instead', 'preaching', 'choir', 'i.e', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'Christians', 'such', 'one', 'version', 'greatest', 'story', 'ever', 'told', 'thankfully', 'not', 'come', 'like', 'dry', 'didactic', 'sermon', 'pulpit.Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'sensibly', 'role', 'Jesus', 'still', 'charismatic', 'appealing/alluring', 'quietly', 'so', 'get', 'angry', 'Temple', 'clearly', 'conflicted', 'garden', 'just', 'prior', 'Judas', 'betrayal', 'most', 'part', 'Sisto', 'Jesus', 'miracles', 'mission', 'ministry', 'fairly', 'mellow', 'fashion', 'miniseries', 'may', 'have', 'raised', 'eyebrows', 'obviously', 'made', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'angry', 'focusing', 'Jesus', 'humanity', 'rather', 'Divinity', 'A', 'Christian', 'friend', 'mine', 'Jesus', 'was', 'divinity', 'personified', 'suggestion', 'may', 'have', 'feelings', 'certain', 'Mary', 'Bethany', 'can', 'not', 'marry', 'just', 'embarking', 'mission', 'Jesus', 'chaste', 'pure', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'anything', 'Suzette', 'Couture', 'teleplay', 'would', 'be', 'offensive', 'anyone', ""'m"", 'not', 'Christian', 'movie', 'church', 'service', 'will', 'make', 'have', 'religious', 'experience', ""'m"", 'happy', 'movie', 'affected', 'least', 'one', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'way', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'film', 'Bible', 'individual', 'interpretation', 'not', 'view', 'Jesus', 'historical/biographical', 'film', 'rather', 'religious', 'one', 'nothing', 'here', 'be', 'offended', 'get', 'up', 'arms', 'put', 'simply', 'Jesus', 'not', 'controversial', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'Christ', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'do', 'want', 'movie', 'tell', 'story', 'compelling', 'fashion', 'solid', 'performances', 'one', 'does.Director', 'Roger', 'Young', 'pace', 'nearly', 'three', 'hour', 'film', 'moving', 'along', 'nicely', 'Originally', 'mini-series', 'was', 'shown', 'TV', 'two', 'parts', 'Oddly', 'later', 'only', 'Part', 'Two', 'was', 'rebrodcast', 'TV', 'Seen', 'complete', 'film', 'DVD', 'brisk', 'interesting', 'hard', 'believe', 'running', 'time', '2', 'Hours', '54', 'Minutes', '.The', 'scenes', 'where', 'Jeroen', 'Krabbe', 'Satan', 'Jesus', 'taunts', 'Him', 'visions', 'future', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'Crucifixion', 'though', 'not', 'graphic', 'gory', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'still', 'terrible', 'watch', 'final', 'scenes', 'Jesus', 'Resurrection', 'Ascension', 'are', 'suitably', 'moving', 'hopeful.Overall', 'casting', 'interesting', 'say', 'least', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'Will', 'Grace', 'Starter', 'Wife', 'Mary', 'Magdaline', 'Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'are', 'Jesus', 'earthly', 'parents', 'Mary', 'Joseph', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Dracula', 'Sid', 'Nancy', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', 'Prick', 'Up', 'Ears', 'course', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Pontius', 'Pilot']",N/A

What we have here is a unique, dramatized angle on the life of Christ, one that shows as much of His humanity as it does His divinity, a lot like the Last Temptation of Christ had attempted to do back in the 80's amidst tons of controvery and MISinterpretation. My qualms with the film are the biblical inaccuracy to a degree, but then again, how many movies(not counting the word-for-word Bible productions such as The JESUS Film, Matthew, Acts or The Gospel of John)gave us a picture of Christ without dramatization and a little filler to capture the audience? I know that in Christendom, many who watch this film and immediately have problems with the portrayal of Christ's humanity as opposed to His divinity being a given(ie,no struggle, no limitations,etc), but the Bible does teach a Christ Who is as human as He is God. To embrace only His divinity is to embrace half the Christ.

It concentrates on only two years of Jesus's life, his last two  years. Jesus is given some real human depth with a lot of laughing and  smiling. Great care is taken to show the political games behind the wings :  the Romans versus the priests, the rebellious fighters against the Romans,  and Jesus in the middle of these intrigues. Poverty, hunger, violence,  executions, tyranny, all the plagues of the Jews, and yet only three  attitudes, three approaches : the priests want peace to save Israel, along  with the King of Judea who wants to save his privileges and his power ;  Barabbas and other jewish fighters who want a revolution (Judas is very  well integrated in this approach) ; and Jesus who sees a long way beyond  and wants to give humanity back its freedom, the freedom of choice, the  possibility to choose between good and evil. This film also shows the  temptations Jesus has to undergo, particularly the way his name will be  used in vain in the twenty odd centuries after his death : inquisition,  crusades, wars... And yet I feel a little bit unsatisfied because the  teachings of Jesus are reduced to very short and light phrases : the accent  is put too much on walking on the water, healing the sick and resurrecting  Lazarus. The teachings are too shallow, and this gives to the whole film a  strange meaning. We do not feel the real completely new approach of Jesus  toward humanity and man's sufferings.

As I watched this film, I strongly felt that it was to mock who He was and IS, and also to mock Christians of the Saviour that we love and adore so very much. The only reason I gave this movie a single star rating is because there is no steaming turd symbol to choose from. If the way that Jesus was portrayed in this film was a true representation of the real Jesus, then I would be ashamed, saddened and worried about what type of Lord I have given my life to. For example, in the scene where Joseph dies...they portray Jesus shouting at God to ""REVIVE HIM!!!!!"" with anger and hopelessness in his voice. The scene when Mary reminds him how he brought a bird back to life as a child and he didn't understand how or why he was able to do it reminded me of Clark Kent lifting the tractor up to save his father in 1978's ""Superman""....also not knowing how or why he could do that.""Jesus"" has the son of God acting like a childish teenager dancing with some women at night, holding a drink and 'waving his hands in the air like he just don't care'....while his disiples stand off to the side grumbling with disaproval, as if to show that they were more prepared than Jesus for not taking his future travel with them more serious. Another scene has Jesus walking down a path with his disiples and He seems to play a stupid game of Tag with the one walking closest to him.I have nothing against Jeremy Sisto as an actor, but He just did a terrible representation of who the Lord is, and how He conducted Himself while He walked this earth as God in Human flesh. He just gives Jesus a conceited,arrogant personality who suddenly turns serious at times when it is too late. Like a scene where Jesus is being disrespectful to a few Roman soldiers with a grim smirk, when suddenly one of them gets stabbed and dies, Jesus suddenly shows care as he runs up to the body sobbing. And when I watched as Jeremy Sisto walked on water at night during a storm approaching his disiples on a small boat....only to stop the storm dead quiet by holding out his hands with a look on the actors face that I can only describe as a prideful ""look what I can do!"" expression was almost enough to make me decorate the floor with my lunch. If you choose to watch this movie, just do not take to heart and believe that Jesus acted this way.

Jesus Christ Superstar does the best job of seeing the parallels between Christ's time and our own (pretty good music too, I hear.) ""The Passion of the Christ,"" as we all now know, is the bloodiest.""Jesus,"" the miniseries, though unrealized in significant ways, attempts to address aspects of the Christ story that others have not and could not. First, the movie focuses on the relationship between Jesus and his earthly father Joseph, played lovingly by Armin Mueller-Stahl. Jesus' love for Joseph is palpably tender and reciprocal. Joseph is the old master; Jesus the eager apprentice, desperate to please and bereft when the old man dies. There is also a romantic sub-plot between Jesus and Martha, in this film depicted as his distant city cousin. Nothing comes of the relationship, but it makes you wonder the degree to which Jesus, fully human even by conservative theological principles, struggled with a desire to be a normal man of his time, learning a trade, getting married, and having a family.Jesus, played adequately by Jeremy Sisto, is also shown as quite playful. He teases his disciples, splashing water in their faces and pulling their scarves. This is fun, though it doesn't seem to move the story anywhere. The scenes of Jesus teaching also attempt to break new ground. Rather than merely stringing together a long list of inscrutable sayings, gospel style, ""Jesus"" shows the Master interacting with the crowd, even getting a good-natured heckling.""Jesus"" fails to show why anyone would find this man threatening. Yet I was fascinated by the film's attempts to show Jesus as a person with an interesting personality of his own. Jesus in this film had real charisma, giving us more than the inexplicable magnetism of most Jesus flicks. Ultimately, the movie does not succeed (none have) in depicting the enigmatic man who has held the world in his spell for two thousand years.

190918,A3SJSNS9LW981O,1573629219,Jeffrey J. Messenger,"[5, 5]","I've been reading the reviews of this film, and a few commentaries may be unfair.For example, does the scene where Jesus tries to raise his earthly father Joseph ... but fails... deny Jesus' divinity?No... after all, the Scriptures tell us how Jesus was ""unable"" to work miracles in Nazareth, as his hometown doubted and criticized his mission.Is it possible that Jesus ""grew into"" his self awareness? I think so... the Bible even implies this.What about the scene where Jesus agrees to ""repent"" as he is baptized by John? That scene has problems, although it is Scriptural to believe that John the Baptist didn't understand Jesus completely. He had times of messianic belief, and times of doubt (although he was in prison as he doubted).I do like it when films try to humanize Jesus, without turning him into a blatant sinner or a weakling. But this Jesus is ""like... a surfer dude, man."" He's also a ""pretty boy,"" and he doesn't seem very Judaic in culture or behavior.  Jeremy Sisko's Jesus is silly, whereupon a mature sense of humor would had seemed more appropriate.The Devil is very ""twentieth century,"" in his suave suit and demeanor... or as a seductive vixen. How about Satan appearing in the context of first century times and culture... just as Jesus had?The bizarre, silly game Pontius Pilate plays with framing and condemning Jesus is also bizarre. Most certainly, Pilate wasn't the sympathetic character as portrayed in Mel Gibson's film... but on the other hand, he probably had much better things to do (as all brutal Roman administrators had) than play mind games with the Jews in his jurisdiction. I especially like Rod Steiger's portrayal of Pilate in ""Jesus of Nazareth."" A burly, brutal, quick tempered and sarcastic administrator who didn't want to be bothered with Judaic affairs... and who ended up becoming more annoyed with the High Priests than with Jesus.

This is a two-tape video that portrays the life of Jesus of Nazareth.  The portrayal is not chronological.  Our first meeting with him is at a carpentry job that Joseph and he are working.  After this, Joseph will die, and Jesus will leave to be tempted in the desert.  All mention of his childhood and birth are through flashbacks.  In this movie, Jesus does not understand that he is the Messiah until the temptation.In this video, the movie producers have included a love interest for Jesus (before the desert).  I understand the producers wish to heighten the effect that he must leave everything behind for his mission, but I was a little disappointed that they would add something like this.  This is similar to what they did in the ""Jeremiah"" video.  The film makers seem to want Jesus to be more human to the viewer.Some other characters are altered a bit.  Mary Magdelene has a bigger role in this movie than she had in the Gospels.  I did not feel that this changed much.  John the Baptist, in a talk with Jesus, seems to be a prophet by career choice rather than by divine direction.  Pontius Pilate seems a bit more vicious in this film.Even though parts are added and others are altered, I would still recommend watching the movie.

Hayes ""bibliophile""","[0, 2]","JesusStarring: Jeremy Sisto, Gary OldmanAmerican release date: March 2, 2010Format/Genre/Length: DVD/Biblical/176 minutesOverall Personal Rating: ASimilar series or titles to check out: Jesus of Nazareth, King of KingsWhen I first began to watch this particular production of the life of Jesus Christ, I was honestly not sure what to expect. I'd caught glimpses of it on TV when it first aired, but not enough to get a feel for it, and back then it was shown with commercials, which never add to one's ability to enjoy a film or mini-series. To be even more honest, the basic reason I watched it was to see Gary Oldman, who is my favorite actor and whom I've adored for years. Adding to my potential confusion, though, was the fact that I had just recently started watching Six Feet Under, which also features Jeremy Sisto as the crazy Billy Chenoweth. And now I was going to watch him play Jesus? I wasn't sure how well I could wrap my head around that.Well, I was totally unprepared to be blown away. Jeremy Sisto brings a freshness and realistic approach to his portrayal of Jesus that is almost as good as Robert Powell's version. He makes him human, as he undoubtedly was, and he makes him playful--there are some really cute scenes with Jesus and his apostles. I wasn't necessarily as taken with the actor who played Judas, his was a more traditional portrayal. It wasn't bad, I just didn't find it above average. Also, I recognized one of the apostles, Thomas as being in the new Showtime series The Borgias. He plays Micheletto, the assassin.Debra Messing as Mary Magdalene was an interesting choice--don't look for her to play Grace here. She plays Mary M in a traditional way, as that of the prostitute who turns her life around for Jesus. I think that is a stereotype started by the church, and that the real woman was not a prostitute, but she has been vilified for years by the church for its own reasons. Regardless, her performance is better than I expected, and shows that Debra Messing can play more serious roles. Jesus' mother is played by veteran actress Jacqueline Bisset, who does a fine job of it.GW Bailey is Philo, a character that helps to unify the plot in terms of the Jewish side and the Roman side, becoming a confidante of the new governor, Pontius Pilate, played very well, as always, by Gary Oldman. He beings humor as well as cruelty to the role. You might remember him as the less than bright but entertaining Rizzo, from the MASH series.One of the interesting aspects of this series which isn't normally brought out much in films concerning Jesus is the relationship between himself and his earthly father, Joseph, played here by Armin Mueller-Stahl. It also shows Jesus in his role as a carpenter's apprentice, and portrays a close bond between the two men that I have no trouble believing existed.  Also there is mention of a love between Jesus and Mary, Lazarus' sister, which is also believable. Jesus was 33 when he died, how hard is it to believe he had feelings for a woman at some point, even if he realized nothing could come of it? There are some realistic scenes where Lazarus gets upset with Jesus for seeming to lead his sister on and breaking her heart.All in all the nearly three hour mini-series flies by. I enjoyed watching it, enjoyed Jeremy Sisto and Gary Oldman very much. I would watch it again without hesitation.",5,"A miniseries with a lot of heart, Jeremy Sisto pushes the envelope!",1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,3371,"['JesusStarring', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'Gary', 'OldmanAmerican', 'release', 'date', 'March', '2', '2010Format/Genre/Length', 'DVD/Biblical/176', 'minutesOverall', 'Personal', 'Rating', 'ASimilar', 'series', 'titles', 'check', 'out', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', 'King', 'KingsWhen', 'first', 'began', 'watch', 'particular', 'production', 'life', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'was', 'honestly', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', ""'d"", 'caught', 'glimpses', 'TV', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'not', 'enough', 'get', 'feel', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'shown', 'commercials', 'never', 'add', 'one', 'ability', 'enjoy', 'film', 'mini-series', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'honest', 'basic', 'reason', 'watched', 'was', 'see', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'who', 'favorite', 'actor', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'adored', 'years', 'Adding', 'potential', 'confusion', 'was', 'fact', 'had', 'just', 'recently', 'started', 'watching', 'Six', 'Feet', 'also', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'crazy', 'Billy', 'Chenoweth', 'now', 'was', 'going', 'watch', 'play', 'Jesus', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'well', 'could', 'wrap', 'head', 'around', 'that.Well', 'was', 'totally', 'unprepared', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'freshness', 'realistic', 'approach', 'portrayal', 'Jesus', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'Robert', 'Powell', 'version', 'human', 'undoubtedly', 'was', 'playful', 'are', 'really', 'cute', 'scenes', 'Jesus', 'apostles', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'taken', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Judas', 'was', 'more', 'traditional', 'portrayal', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'above', 'average', 'Also', 'recognized', 'one', 'apostles', 'Thomas', 'being', 'new', 'Showtime', 'series', 'Borgias', 'Micheletto', 'assassin.Debra', 'Messing', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'was', 'interesting', 'choice', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'play', 'Grace', 'here', 'Mary', 'M', 'traditional', 'way', 'prostitute', 'who', 'life', 'Jesus', 'think', 'stereotype', 'started', 'church', 'real', 'woman', 'was', 'not', 'prostitute', 'been', 'vilified', 'years', 'church', 'own', 'reasons', 'Regardless', 'performance', 'better', 'expected', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'can', 'play', 'more', 'serious', 'roles', 'Jesus', 'mother', 'played', 'veteran', 'actress', 'Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'who', 'fine', 'job', 'it.GW', 'Bailey', 'Philo', 'character', 'unify', 'plot', 'terms', 'Jewish', 'side', 'Roman', 'side', 'becoming', 'confidante', 'new', 'governor', 'Pontius', 'Pilate', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'always', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'cruelty', 'role', 'might', 'remember', 'less', 'bright', 'entertaining', 'Rizzo', 'MASH', 'series.One', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'series', ""n't"", 'normally', 'brought', 'out', 'much', 'films', 'concerning', 'Jesus', 'relationship', 'earthly', 'father', 'Joseph', 'played', 'here', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'also', 'Jesus', 'role', 'carpenter', 'apprentice', 'close', 'bond', 'two', 'men', 'have', 'trouble', 'believing', 'existed', 'Also', 'mention', 'love', 'Jesus', 'Mary', 'Lazarus', 'sister', 'also', 'believable', 'Jesus', 'was', '33', 'when', 'died', 'how', 'hard', 'believe', 'had', 'feelings', 'woman', 'point', 'even', 'realized', 'nothing', 'could', 'come', 'are', 'realistic', 'scenes', 'where', 'Lazarus', 'upset', 'Jesus', 'seeming', 'lead', 'sister', 'breaking', 'heart.All', 'nearly', 'three', 'hour', 'mini-series', 'flies', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'enjoyed', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'very', 'much', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'hesitation']",N/A

The movie first came on NBC three years ago around easter time and my brother,sister, and I were just glued to the television. The first thing people would think is that it's boring because it's a ""Jesus"" film, but this was a very impressive movie. The best of any movies about Christ! The acting was good, and very accurate in showing Jesus life in being tempted, crucified, and the love and mercy he showed to others. His love and forgiveness toward Mary Magalene in the movie shows how God is really loving and forgiving towards us as human beings. It was very touching. And unlike the Passion, it showed the rest of his life until he went back to heaven after resurrecting from the grave and, trust me, this was WAAAAAY better than ""The Passion of the Christ"".

I wasn't bored for a moment while watching it.  It depicts many stories in the Gospel quite accurately, but I do agree with some of our other reviewers that I question whether or not Jesus actually was in love with women and vice versa.  We don't usually think of Jesus in that way, and some Christians may even find it blasphemous, but we must remember that Jesus was indeed a human being while he was on this earth, although he was also the son of God.  It's highly possible that Jesus felt love and temptation same as the rest of us do.  This film certainly depicts the human side of Jesus, which I find very refreshing.  It reminds me of the fact that he took human form and lived on this earth for awhile for the purpose of knowing what it's really like to be human.  I also like the fact that his mother Mary plays such a major role in this film.  We don't hear or think about Mary much except in the Christmas story, but no doubt she played a major role in Jesus' life, because she was his mother.

There is documentation that supports that Jesus was a flesh and blood person regardless of whether or not he was the &quot;Son of God&quot;.  There is also documentation that says he actually married Mary Magdelan.  There is also the Bible which is another piece of documentation that supports otherwise.  I am of the opinion that the Bible may be right or wrong (or both, in part).  When Susan Baez said that people were not &quot;saved&quot; because they could accept or even contemplate Jesus having sexual or even strong feelings for a woman &quot;like one of us would do&quot; she was being very naive.  If Jesus was the son of god and came to earth to show us how to be good people, it would make sense for him to be tempted and then make a decision based on his principles.  Jesus coming to earth as flesh and blood would have to experience what we do.  He experienced birth, growth, work, friends, mother, father, discrimination and death, why not love and/or sexual desire.  We should not just read the bible and close ourselves off to our own intelligent minds.  Open yourself up and realise that something written so long ago and translated so many times could not retain it's original meaning even if it were fact in the first place.  I am &quot;saved&quot; because I save myself, I don't let a preacher, priest, minister, nun, pope or anyone else do it for me.  This movie is just another look at a famous story.  Religious or not it is worth a watch for entertainment.  That is why movies are made, to entertain.

190935,A3CPX27XQ4BOKX,1573629219,moviemusicbuff,"[25, 30]","This movie is one of the most interesting depictions of Jesus on film.  It is not the most accurate but there are several scenes that give us food for thought.The writers tried to emphasize more the human side of Jesus -- Jesus enjoyed life, laughed, danced, joked around with his disciples, and yet was the Son of God and Savior.Some interesting (but not so biblically accurate) scenes:1) Jesus resurrected sparrows during his childhood.  This is taken from the Gospel of Thomas (a non-canonical book), and not from Scripture.2) This is one of the few Jesus movies, where it is inferred that he was attracted to women and vice-versa.  Mary of Bethany is portrayed as being attracted to Jesus but Jesus has to reject her marriage proposal because of his higher mission as the Messiah.  Later, Jesus has a heart to heart talk with Mary Magdalene; there is noticeable chemistry between the two of them.3) The Temptation scene:  Satan appears as a seductive woman in a red dress and then morphs into a businessman in an Armani suit (played by Jeroen Krabbe).  Satan tempts Jesus to let go of his divinity and to submit to raw power.  Jesus seems to be unsure of himself and his divinity.4) Jesus is depicted as dancing in the celebrations at Cana and at other parties.  He splashes water on the disciples, skips rocks across the water, and plays tag with the disciples (!)  Then he gets serious and performs miracles or launches into a brief sermonette (Jesus' teachings are very, very brief in this movie).5) Jesus' dependency on Mary, his earthly mother.  Mary needs to reassure Jesus when he is down and suffers from self-doubt.6) Jeremy Sisto is an interesting choice to play Jesus.  Jesus talks almost like an older adolescent with long hair and 1st century clothes.  He is unsure of himself at times and about his role as the Messiah.  This is most noticeable in the earlier scenes when he has to be reassured by Mary and during the Temptation scenes when he seems like he is trying to make up his mind on how to respond to Satan's temptation.These scenes are interesting in that it forces the viewer to think about the following questions:What was Jesus like as a child?  How was he submissive to his earthly parents?Was Jesus attracted to women or vice-versa?Were the Temptations an ongoing occurrence throughout Jesus' ministry while He was on earth?How serious was Jesus? Did he laugh and enjoy life?Viewers who subscribe to an evangelical and conservative theological standpoint and want a depiction of Jesus which is biblically accurate would most likely object to many of these scenes.  However, I think this movie is valuable because it causes the viewer to think about the human aspect of Jesus and what He was like.I may not have agreed with many of the depictions of Jesus in this movie but I'm glad that I was motivated through watching this movie to think about these questions.  I've found that this movie helped to facilitate many interesting and meaningful discussions on who Jesus really was.  Do we have preconceived stereotypical images of Jesus in our minds?  Are we willing to accommodate a different depiction of Jesus other than the ones we're used to?",3,An interesting but inaccurate depiction of Jesus,1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,3178,"['movie', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'depictions', 'Jesus', 'film', 'not', 'most', 'accurate', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'give', 'food', 'thought.The', 'writers', 'tried', 'emphasize', 'more', 'human', 'side', 'Jesus', 'Jesus', 'enjoyed', 'life', 'laughed', 'danced', 'joked', 'disciples', 'yet', 'was', 'Son', 'God', 'Savior.Some', 'interesting', 'not', 'so', 'biblically', 'accurate', 'scenes:1', 'Jesus', 'resurrected', 'sparrows', 'childhood', 'taken', 'Gospel', 'Thomas', 'non-canonical', 'book', 'not', 'Scripture.2', 'one', 'few', 'Jesus', 'movies', 'where', 'inferred', 'was', 'attracted', 'women', 'vice-versa', 'Mary', 'Bethany', 'portrayed', 'being', 'attracted', 'Jesus', 'Jesus', 'reject', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'higher', 'mission', 'Messiah', 'Later', 'Jesus', 'heart', 'heart', 'talk', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'noticeable', 'chemistry', 'two', 'them.3', 'Temptation', 'scene', 'Satan', 'seductive', 'woman', 'red', 'dress', 'then', 'morphs', 'businessman', 'Armani', 'suit', 'played', 'Jeroen', 'Krabbe', 'Satan', 'Jesus', 'let', 'go', 'divinity', 'submit', 'raw', 'power', 'Jesus', 'be', 'unsure', 'divinity.4', 'Jesus', 'depicted', 'dancing', 'celebrations', 'Cana', 'other', 'parties', 'water', 'disciples', 'skips', 'rocks', 'water', 'tag', 'disciples', 'Then', 'serious', 'performs', 'miracles', 'launches', 'brief', 'sermonette', 'Jesus', 'teachings', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'brief', 'movie', '.5', 'Jesus', 'dependency', 'Mary', 'earthly', 'mother', 'Mary', 'reassure', 'Jesus', 'when', 'down', 'suffers', 'self-doubt.6', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'interesting', 'choice', 'play', 'Jesus', 'Jesus', 'almost', 'older', 'adolescent', 'long', 'hair', '1st', 'century', 'clothes', 'unsure', 'times', 'role', 'Messiah', 'most', 'noticeable', 'earlier', 'scenes', 'when', 'be', 'reassured', 'Mary', 'Temptation', 'scenes', 'when', 'trying', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'how', 'respond', 'Satan', 'temptation.These', 'scenes', 'are', 'interesting', 'viewer', 'think', 'following', 'questions', 'What', 'was', 'Jesus', 'child', 'How', 'was', 'submissive', 'earthly', 'parents', 'Was', 'Jesus', 'attracted', 'women', 'vice-versa', 'Temptations', 'ongoing', 'occurrence', 'Jesus', 'ministry', 'was', 'earth', 'How', 'serious', 'was', 'Jesus', 'Did', 'laugh', 'enjoy', 'life', 'Viewers', 'who', 'subscribe', 'evangelical', 'conservative', 'theological', 'standpoint', 'want', 'depiction', 'Jesus', 'biblically', 'accurate', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'object', 'many', 'scenes', 'However', 'think', 'movie', 'valuable', 'viewer', 'think', 'human', 'aspect', 'Jesus', 'what', 'was', 'like.I', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'agreed', 'many', 'depictions', 'Jesus', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', 'motivated', 'watching', 'movie', 'think', 'questions', ""'ve"", 'found', 'movie', 'helped', 'facilitate', 'many', 'interesting', 'meaningful', 'discussions', 'who', 'Jesus', 'really', 'was', 'Do', 'have', 'preconceived', 'stereotypical', 'images', 'Jesus', 'minds', 'Are', 'willing', 'accommodate', 'different', 'depiction', 'Jesus', 'other', 'ones', ""'re"", 'used']",N/A

He was probably devoted to Joseph as most sons would be with their fathers, so they took a little liberty, but I don't think that it was a bad thing. No it does not follow scripture (no evidence Jesus was interested in Mary, John the Baptist knew full well who Jesus was before he baptized him etc...) but any movie that will get people interested in the Lord is good as long as it does not desecrate him (having sex, girlfriends etc, being a mook etc).

If he did, this 2000 made-for-cable version of the life of the son of God would be good material to draw from.JESUS begins when Jesus (Jeremy Sisto) has long since reached adulthood, working as a carpenter along side his earthly father, Joseph (Armin Mueller-Stahl). When Joseph dies, Jesus mother Mary (Jacqueline Bisset) tells him his time has come to teach the world of God's love for all, and Jesus heads out in to Israel. He is baptized by John the Baptist (David O'Hara), fasts in the sesert for 40 days and 40 nights, returns to Galillee to bring Mary with him,attracts a following of seventy-two disciples, twelve of whom he selects to be his apostles, turns water into wine, walks on water, drives moneychangers out of the temple, brings prostitute Mary Magdelene (Debra Messing) into his inner circle, triumphantly enters into Jerusalem, is arrest by the Jewish authorities who revile him as a blasphemer and social revolutionary, is sentenced to death by Roman governor Pontius Pilate (Gary Oldman), is crucified, and finally, after three days, rises again and sends his apostles into the world to spread the message of his and God's love and salvation.Let me catch my breath hear.Okay. The story of Jesus is truly an amazing story, fully suited to be put on film again and again, but JESUS is certainly one of the better one's, thanks largely to a truly phenomenal performance by Jeremy Sisto. Jesus is so often portrayed as divine from the get-go in movies, which tends to comprimise the view that he is a much a man as he is an immortal. This has been standard filmmaking prctice for years in Hollywood, but there hasn't been a Jesus like this since Willem Dafoe's equally strong performance in THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST. And while I am mad that no film about Jesus has ever tackled the subject of his marital life (It is my firm belief that Jesus was married to Mary Magadelene, and was probably a Father but this did not at all intefere with his being the Messiah) JESUS is a winner. Jeremy Sisto brings a kind of big brother element to his portrayal of Jesus, as a man who is being lead by his Father through all of his adventures, but is above all a Jesus who isn't just BORN the Messiah, but who also CHOOSES to be the Messiah.Bottom line: If you, like me, wanted to see movies about the life of JESUS after seeing THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, JESUS could very well be the best place to start, though LAST TEMPTATION also has many merits.",5,Disregard for scripture my @$$,1133654400,"12 4, 2005",2005,2658,"['have', 'long', 'been', 'convinced', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'should', 'make', 'prequel', 'magnificent', 'visceral', 'work', 'art', 'PASSION', 'THE', 'CHRIST', 'birth', 'Jesus', 'way', 'last', 'supper', 'did', '2000', 'made-for-cable', 'version', 'life', 'son', 'God', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'material', 'draw', 'from.JESUS', 'when', 'Jesus', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'long', 'reached', 'adulthood', 'working', 'carpenter', 'side', 'earthly', 'father', 'Joseph', 'Armin', 'Mueller-Stahl', 'When', 'Joseph', 'Jesus', 'mother', 'Mary', 'Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'time', 'come', 'teach', 'world', 'God', 'love', 'Jesus', 'out', 'Israel', 'baptized', 'John', 'Baptist', 'David', ""O'Hara"", 'sesert', '40', 'days', '40', 'nights', 'returns', 'Galillee', 'bring', 'Mary', 'following', 'seventy-two', 'disciples', 'twelve', 'whom', 'be', 'apostles', 'water', 'wine', 'walks', 'water', 'moneychangers', 'temple', 'prostitute', 'Mary', 'Magdelene', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'inner', 'circle', 'triumphantly', 'Jerusalem', 'arrest', 'Jewish', 'authorities', 'who', 'revile', 'blasphemer', 'social', 'revolutionary', 'sentenced', 'death', 'Roman', 'governor', 'Pontius', 'Pilate', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'crucified', 'finally', 'three', 'days', 'again', 'apostles', 'world', 'spread', 'message', 'God', 'love', 'salvation.Let', 'catch', 'breath', 'hear.Okay', 'story', 'Jesus', 'truly', 'amazing', 'story', 'fully', 'suited', 'be', 'put', 'film', 'again', 'again', 'JESUS', 'certainly', 'one', 'better', 'one', 'thanks', 'largely', 'truly', 'phenomenal', 'performance', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'Jesus', 'so', 'often', 'portrayed', 'divine', 'get-go', 'movies', 'comprimise', 'view', 'much', 'man', 'immortal', 'been', 'standard', 'filmmaking', 'prctice', 'years', 'Hollywood', 'there', ""n't"", 'been', 'Jesus', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'equally', 'strong', 'performance', 'LAST', 'TEMPTATION', 'OF', 'CHRIST', 'am', 'mad', 'film', 'Jesus', 'ever', 'tackled', 'subject', 'marital', 'life', 'firm', 'belief', 'Jesus', 'was', 'married', 'Mary', 'Magadelene', 'was', 'probably', 'Father', 'did', 'not', 'intefere', 'being', 'Messiah', 'JESUS', 'winner', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'kind', 'big', 'brother', 'element', 'portrayal', 'Jesus', 'man', 'who', 'being', 'lead', 'Father', 'adventures', 'Jesus', 'who', ""n't"", 'just', 'BORN', 'Messiah', 'who', 'also', 'CHOOSES', 'be', 'Messiah.Bottom', 'line', 'wanted', 'see', 'movies', 'life', 'JESUS', 'seeing', 'PASSION', 'THE', 'CHRIST', 'JESUS', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'best', 'place', 'start', 'LAST', 'TEMPTATION', 'also', 'many', 'merits']",N/A

This is a movie that told a lie from the very beginning depicting Mary, sister of Lazarus, as having a romantic relationship with our Lord. What in heaven's name are people thinking who write these movies? No where in the Bible does it say this. Whoever wrote the movie does not know Scripture or they would know this to be untrue. Jesus came to earth in the form of a man to be the sacrificial Lamb for the world. He came sinless and He remained sinless to His death on Calvary. To show Him otherwise is a distortion of truth from God's Word and I am so sick of Hollywood's interpretation of the Bible because they try to glory in things that are not there. He became flesh and suffered for you and me and took the sins of the world on Him and paid such a price for our salvation. To show Him any other way makes me sick. So whoever is thinking of buying this please think twice because this movie and many like it should never have been made. Jesus did not love woman in the form of Mary. Jesus loved each of us to the cross and gave of Himself freely so we might live eternally with Him.

Jeremy Sisto also has the look we have come to believe as Jesus over time. I loved that Jesus laughed and enjoyed life in this movie. However, I do believe He was much more aware of His mission than was presented to the viewer.Jeremy is not very convincing at first, but has your heart near the end. Yes, they did take a few liberties with this movie and the dressing scene was not at all necessary and almost insulting in a movie about Christ. If you are familiar with the Bible stories then you will also find many errors in the story line and that was a bit disappointing.The whole story of Jesus being in love with Mary (Martha's sister) was news to me. I was not really offended by it as it added to the story, but felt that the way I had always heard the story was that Mary loved Jesus more as a brother....The story starts with Jesus awaking from a nightmare. Later the viewer sees more of his life revealed in flashback scenes. I thought the way they told the story was very creative, however what it lacked was more of Christ's wisdom and His words as recorded in the Bible. I find the words of Christ to be incredibly beautiful and in most of the movies made on his life, they do include so much more. There were really important parts of Jesus' Life that were not really even touched on.Some points to make: Jesus is sinless, so there was not need for him to confess his sins. John said: ""Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world,"" when he saw Jesus arriving, not leaving. I always imagined Jesus being submerged in water at his baptism, symbolizing death and coming back to life.When tempted by the Devil, the Devil kept changing from a temptress to a tempter which was creative and the scenes where Jesus and the Devil fly above the earth and go to the Temple were quite good. The scenes of people killing in God's name only showed how people use others to achieve their own aims. They didn't show all the families who are blessed by believing in God, nor did they show the joy only Jesus can give.I absolutely loved the scene of Jesus swinging the child around and laughing and when He is walking on the water. The Temple scenes were He tosses out the money changers was superbly done. It showed that He had holy anger and still was not sinning. His relationship with His mother was so beautifully portrayed, and yes, she was very much a part of his life. The agony of her loosing her son is so sad.Perhaps by seeing how wonderful Jesus is, many will do more research on his life and find all the wonderful words of Christ in the Bible.Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.

What I like most about it is what is the one star reviews seem to have been most critical of.  The portrayal of Jesus as a real man.  Some versions of the story are so fearful of disrespect that they portray Jesus as almost a plaster saint come to life, with no feelings, except piety and love with no real warmth for any individuals because it's all spent on MANKIND, as a giant entity.  So, to those critics, don't you think a young man, even if he has a serious mission,  would have no interest in humor, in enjoying the company of his friends, of enjoying family celebrations?  You think he might just possibly have had love enough for Joseph to be upset at his death?  I sure do.  That Joseph aspect is what I most like about this movie.  Most versions, after the Bethlehem part of the story, hardly bother to mention Joseph again. You think it's possible that Jesus at least considered that maybe a wife might be a good thing for him?  I don't see why not.  If, according the the scriptures Jesus was sent to earth to experience what men experience, I would hate to think he totally missed out on humor, fun, laughter, and  the idea that , while it may not be for everyone, love and marriage can enrich your life.

Christ's human side is brought out more, and I think it really reflects how much he really loved everyone. He's not portryed so much as a holy figure, but a man who  is warm and caring and fun. However, I think they took a little too many  liberties. The Jesus in this film acts like he has no idea what is going  on, and it's his mother who is instructing him on what to do, not God. Some  times he even acts like a happy-go-lucky, fun-loving guy...he's even giddy  at times. But, other than that, I think the way Christ is portrayed gives  us a better view on his human side. Sisto's acting is pretty good, although  at times it sounds like he's reading his lines right off of a script. The  movie is accurate in the crucifixion, however, and shows some scenes that  aren't showed in other Jesus films, like him walking on the water or the  wedding, where he turned water in to wine. Another brilliant point, I  think, is how they showed the conflict of Christ in the garden with Satan,  and Satan is trying to convince Christ not to go through the crucifixion.

However, I really loved this version of Jesus' life on earth. I must say that Jeremy Sisto!! was the perfect pick to portray Jesus. They couldn't have chosen a better actor for this role and I feel that Sisto has not gotten the credit he deserves for his role in playing our Savior. He gave an outstanding performance. Great job Jeremy!! I won't go into all the details of this movie for we all know the story of Jesus' life on earth. However, I will say that this version gives us a different look at Jesus.... the man. We see a side of him not portrayed in the other films. We see a Jesus with a sense of humor, a playful man who is both funloving and joyful. I especially loved these scenes for portraying Jesus as not only our Savior but a human... a man.

190954,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,1573629219,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[3, 6]","The first thing I'd like to say about this movie is that it's out to show Who Jesus was, not just What He was.  Did they get everything right?  I can't say for sure; I wasn't there.  One thing I can say is that some of the suppositions in the movie have offended a lot of people.  I really can't see why; this is one interpretation and one view, one that I personally find strikes very close to my own perceptions.  In the Bible there are differing accounts, differing interpretations (remember the Bible is actually a collection of books written by different authors over many centuries and then banded together as a single volume.  There were also a host of other books written at the same time by other believers giving their own interpretations, their own recollections of stories often handed down orally for many years before being put down on paper.  Anyway I'm running on too long here.  The point of this writeup isn't to debate theology).  Some (not all by any means, but some) conservatives seem to believe that other people cannot ponder things and arrive at very different conclusions in equally good conscience.Although ""Jesus"" presents Him as the Messiah, one doesn't have to be of that belief to enjoy the tale and be rewarded by it.  For example, contrary to ridiculous slander, Jews and Muslims do Not hate Jesus; Jewish people seem to like him very much but just don't believe the Messiah bit, in the same way a non-Buddhist may like Buddha the man without believing him divine; Muslims regard Jesus as one of the Five Prophets but again have a differing layout of things than Christians.  As far as I'm concerned, Jesus is in one way kind of like Ghandi, Mother Theresa, Martin Luther King Jr. and so on in that whatever one's religion (Christianity, Hinduism, Native American religions, whatever)or lack thereof they've done so much that you Have to at least respect them.  And this is coming from someone who does believe in Christ's divinity, although I feel much of what He said has been grossly misconstrued, either accidentally or intentionally.To get back on the movie and away from all the controversy that surrounded it, Jeremy Sisto does a tremendous job in playing the title role, presenting a character who's driven while still a mirthful, joyous and in many ways childlike figure (in the best sense of the word - His innocence, his faith in the basic goodness of the human race despite all the evidence he witnesses to the contrary, his interest and fascination in everything around him that most others fail to notice), who's focused while still struggling against the weight of his mission on his shoulders, and who in the early going is still just puzzling out that mission Himself.  In fact, the whole cast is great - Gary Oldman gets a special mention, partly for the way he's made every role he's played so utterly distinct from one another you can barely even tell it's the same performer.  But everybody in this handles their own part superbly.The one scene in the movie I feel was poorly handled was the scene involving the money lenders at the temples.  I think somebody might have interpreted some Biblical passage or something way too literally - the image of Jesus storming the scene fists flying is hardly in keeping with the Jesus I think of, or that this very film depicts.  Different people, different interpretations, I guess.  Among one of the much better scenes is the healing of the sparrow; I'm so glad they included this - the God I believe in is the God of all the creatures and not just the human creature; to go deeper into my philosophy on this issue would get off the track of the movie far too much.  One of the more disturbing, even horrifying scenes (other than the crucifixion, which is more delicately handled here than in some other films but still brutally hard to watch) is the images shown to Jesus in the desert by the devil, of what His followers would do in the coming centuries.  Thinking about what Jesus must make of all this while looking down on the Earth has always been a very sad and intriguing question.  But probably the most important feature of the whole show is to portray Jesus as not just Jesus, the Christ and all goes with it, but also as just Jesus, the individual.  And not have either of those roles take away from each other, but actually enhance each other (that's a major victory on the part of the filmmakers).  People forget that when they talk about God and company.  God isn't just God the Almighty Creator, He's an individual to (or should that be Individual?)  Gabriel isn't just Gabriel the Archangel, he's an individual.  I would think it would be pleasing to Them for people to remember that and get to know them for, as I stated with Jesus above, who they are and not just what they are.I've probably alienated a few people with this writeup (I know I'm not exactly traditional in all my outlooks) but I've actually saved most of my more unorthodox views (including the really strange, hard-to-explain ones) on God, Jesus, right and wrong, love, destiny and all that to focus on the movie and not my own spiritual opinions.  This film is outstanding, one of the best acted features out there, with magnificent production that was pretty much unprecedented for made-for-tv fare when it was released, and still blows most tv movies/mini-series out of the water on a technical scale.  Gorgeous photography, more stuff to think about than I've had a chance to bring up here, and it does justice to its subject matter.

True, it does have some dramatic license, but nothing that occured in this film was beyond the realm of possibility. Jeremy Sisto gives a good performance. I was surprised to hear that he has Buddist leanings (No offense torwards the people who follow this religion, of course.). I'm glad to see Jesus portrayed this way. Most of the people I've seen portray out Messiah were somber, and sad throughout. But Sisto's portrayal is the best I've ever seen. THIS is the personality I think Jesus truly had, and still has today. I really don't think he'd go around moping all the time, until near the time of His crucifixion, which I think would really be the only time he was sad. Great performance by Jerone Krabbe as Satan. I found him to be truly believable.

This (originally anonymous) Gospel was thrown out of the Canon at one of the first conferences on the Bible.Because it relies on this Gospel, it puts forward the Gnostic heresies which almost all the Epistles (not just Paul's either) at some point rail against.  The entirity of John's letters are to denounce this!I was also offended by the performance of John the Baptist.  At every point, I thought he was going to try and sell me a used car.I would have given this crap no stars, but there was no choice for that.  Well, I suppose Oldman's performance as Pilate (actually the best Pilate I've seen) deserves one star to itself.If you value the Bible we have been given, I warn you to steer clear of this.....",1,"My Prediction is Come True, sadly",1033603200,"10 3, 2002",2002,1025,"['only', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'screenwriters', 'actually', 'researched', 'events', 'life', 'Pilate', 'Oldman', 'wonderful', 'prformance', 'always', 'led', 'utterly', 'human', 'spinelessness', 'Trial', 'Jesus', '.Above', 'Gospel', 'According', 'Saint', 'Thomas', 'source', 'originally', 'anonymous', 'Gospel', 'was', 'thrown', 'Canon', 'one', 'first', 'conferences', 'Bible.Because', 'Gospel', 'forward', 'Gnostic', 'heresies', 'almost', 'Epistles', 'not', 'just', 'Paul', 'either', 'point', 'rail', 'entirity', 'John', 'letters', 'are', 'denounce', 'was', 'also', 'offended', 'performance', 'John', 'Baptist', 'point', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'try', 'sell', 'used', 'car.I', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'crap', 'stars', 'was', 'choice', 'Well', 'suppose', 'Oldman', 'performance', 'Pilate', 'actually', 'best', 'Pilate', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'star', 'itself.If', 'value', 'Bible', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'warn', 'steer', 'clear', '..']",N/A
