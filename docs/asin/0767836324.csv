The ones who don't like it, don't understand the underlying thread. Peter grows up - and forgets his childhood as the flying menace. He is even afraid of heights! It doesn't matter whether you are a spielberg fan or not, if you love interesting films that hauntingly leave a mark of childishness on your heart, then this is for you. I have watched this film more than any other movie. I seriously KNOW for a fact that since I was 11 I have viewed it over a hundred times....easily! I had a copy...then I bought it on vhs...then the other day bought it on dvd and it still hasn't lost its meaning to me. I could still watch it twice in a row and not loose an ounce of attention. Maybe it's Robin Williams perfect transition from snobby business man, to the high flying , sword chopping, pirate stomping, peter pan. Or Dustin Hoffman, who endured just as many hours in make-up as he did in Tootsie, to bring to life the ultimate clock-hating villain, who despises the &quot;L&quot; word. Or Bob Hoskins (Who framed Rodger Rabbit), an excellent Smee, more brain than bum-fundled. Julia Roberts had me in the state-of-crush for about 3 years. Anyway, Hook is a 5 star great movie that THE People love. Forget the critics for this one. The dvd is sharp, and sounds terrific. As far as sound, check out Smee's &quot;Good morning neverland.&quot; I would seriously enjoy ANY extra's, because the skull and crossbones on this disc represent death to extra lover's.

21107,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767836324,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 10]","`Hook' was one of those movies that I loved as a child.  I think that that really is the point here.  As a child, it is hard to find the flaws because you are just watching something that is entertaining.  There are pirates and there is Peter Pan (who is beloved by all children) and there is fantasy and danger and there's that whole moving bit about family togetherness and, well, when you are under the age of ten this movie is just about perfect.Try watching it at thirty.Honestly, this movie is far too aware of the message it is trying to convey and so it does it in such a straightforward and glaringly obvious manner that it feels devoid of any real feeling.  DON'T FORGET YOUR YOUTH PETER!  DON'T BE MEAN TO YOUR KIDS PETER!  DON'T BE SO SERIOUS PETER!  I mean, it doesn't know the word `subtle' and so it never institutes it, not once.  That wouldn't be so bad if the remainder of the film wasn't a giant clich&eacute; in itself.  From Peter's home life to his children's daddy issues to the stereotypical and lazy way the Lost Boys are utterly DESTROYED here (UGH, what have you DONE Steven?  Why do most of the Lost Boys come across mildly retarded?) is just almost heartbreaking.  I think another mistake on the part of the film is making Peter appear to be a complete villain in the film's outset, even when his kids are legitimately being annoying as all get out (especially his son).  I mean, if I were that boy's father I probably would have smacked him on the plane.  Like, I understand that he's a workaholic and too serious and wound up or whatever, but they could have tried to balance that more.  Thus the `in your face' complaint I mentioned earlier.Seriously, Peter Pan is like one of my favorite childhood memories, but watching `Hook' in my adulthood has tarnished that blessed memory for me.Robin Williams is out of his comfort zone here.  He tries to be Robin Williams, which doesn't work with this character.  Julia Roberts is cutesy as always, basically playing Julia Roberts, and she manages to create a stirring image of fun or whatever but she never really lands the heart of Tink (even when she tries).  Dante Basco is horrible, but the whole idea of Rufio is a total failure in itself.  Whoever came up with that should have been punched in the face.  Maggie Smith is SUBLIME, and Dustin Hoffman all but saves this movie from being completely horrid thanks to his charismatic take on Captain Hook.The film is pretty, the sets are great and the visuals are intriguing, but overall this grown up fairytale is a mess.On another note, Amber Scott, the young actress who plays Peter's daughter Maggie, has grown up to be a total knockout.

It's the kind of warm and fuzzy movie to be enjoyed time and again. Robin Williams stars as a grown up Peter Pan(now named Peter Panning), who doesn't remember who he really is. While on a trip to Old Wendy's place, his two children are kidnapped by Captain Hook. With the help of Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell, Peter has to go to Never Never Land to save his kids, battle Captain Hook, and realize that he is the one and only Peter Pan. The costumes are great, the sets are awe inducing, and the actors are all game. People, I ask you, who is better at playing at a person who refuses to grow up than Robin Williams?. I don't think the part could of been better cast. Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook is an image to behold. It's a classic Hoffman performance. Keep an eye out for cameos by Phil Collins, Glenn Close, and a very young Gwynneth Paltrow. This movie should entertain kids and adults alike. Kids will cherish their youth, while adults will most definitley be transported back to a magical time to think about their own youth. This is a whimsical fairy tale that's a delight from the first to last frame. I can't believe why so many people have a deep disliking of this movie. Oh well. Their loss.

21116,A3MQQS40FK2QAQ,0767836324,"Bradford P. Ruhle ""Brad Ruhle""","[1, 1]","Here is a Steven Spielberg movie that should&#8217;ve been a fantastic film. Having him direct a Peter Pan movie, and explore the possibility of what would happen if Peter actually grew up should&#8217;ve created something really magical. But even though the film works up to a point and is certainly entertaining it really fails to deliver on those possibilities. That is due to at least three weak points that I will explain in a moment.The premise is very interesting. At the end of the original Peter Pan play he returned to bring Wendy back to Neverland in the spring, and she grew up while he didn&#8217;t. In HOOK he returned to Wendy and she became a grandmother. Peter saw her granddaughter Moira (Caroline Goodall) and fell in love. He decided not to return and grow up. Now he has a different name: Peter Banning. He is a forty-something workaholic attorney and has completely forgotten about Neverland. He is focusing all his attention on his business and is missing the wonder of his children Jack (Charlie Korsmo), and Maggie (Amber Scott) as they&#8217;re growing up. But even though Peter no longer remembers Neverland, apparently Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) has never forgotten what Peter did to him. He found a way to follow Peter to the real world and steals his children. Hook is one of the better characters in the movie, along with his sidekick Smee (the late Bob Hoskins).Wendy (the delightful Dame Maggie Smith) knows that Hook is determined to seek revenge on him and that Peter Banning must find a way to return to Neverland and save the children. That&#8217;s when Peter&#8217;s old friend Tinker Bell (Julia Roberts) steps in. Right here is where HOOK makes its first big mistake. Tinker Bell speaks English, and is loud and hyperactive. This is wrong, wrong, wrong! Tinker Bell is supposed to speak using a little bell sound, and with her face and body language. It&#8217;s ironic that twelve years after HOOK came out that another adaptation of Peter Pan got this detail right: The big budgeted 2003 version with Jason Issacs as Hook and Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan. It is a film that fixes the mistakes that HOOK generates.The second mistake is Neverland itself. Except for a great establishing shot of the island it looks entirely what it was: a movie set. The dock where Hook&#8217;s ship spends the entire movie at doesn&#8217;t look like anything else. Neither does the tree home of the Lost Boys. (And where is the Indian Tiger Lilly, who Peter actually saved in the original play? Spielberg lost an opportunity to bring the character in and see her POV of what happened to Peter.) The only thing that looks real at all is Captain Hook&#8217;s ship. It&#8217;s also a set, but at least it looks like an actual ship.Peter does find a way to save his children and defeat Captain Hook, along with the Important Message that is delivered in the third and final mistake. The ending goes on, and on, and on. It drags on for so long that it becomes one absolute preachy ending. Spielberg and his filmmakers just can&#8217;t leave well enough alone. But despite these three big mistakes, I still liked part the movie. The opening is really good; unlike so many of his movies, Robin Williams doesn&#8217;t stop the film to do his many voice-overs. He isn&#8217;t trying to be funny. (Williams would go on to prove he can do some absolutely serious work like GOOD WILL HUNTING, and ONE HOUR PHOTO). The laughs for me came from Hoskins&#8217; Smee, and some of the things Hoffman was saying as Captain Hook.My actual Star Rating would be 2 stars instead of three, but Amazon doesn&#8217;t allow me that.",3,A film that could've been a masterpiece.,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,3630,"['Here', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'movie', 'should', '8217', 've', 'been', 'fantastic', 'film', 'Having', 'direct', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'movie', 'explore', 'possibility', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'Peter', 'actually', 'grew', 'up', 'should', '8217', 've', 'created', 'something', 'really', 'magical', 'even', 'film', 'up', 'point', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'really', 'deliver', 'possibilities', 'due', 'least', 'three', 'weak', 'points', 'will', 'explain', 'moment.The', 'premise', 'very', 'interesting', 'end', 'original', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'play', 'returned', 'bring', 'Wendy', 'back', 'Neverland', 'spring', 'grew', 'up', '8217', 't.', 'HOOK', 'returned', 'Wendy', 'became', 'grandmother', 'Peter', 'saw', 'granddaughter', 'Moira', 'Caroline', 'Goodall', 'fell', 'love', 'decided', 'not', 'return', 'grow', 'up', 'Now', 'different', 'name', 'Peter', 'Banning', 'forty-something', 'workaholic', 'attorney', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'Neverland', 'focusing', 'attention', 'business', 'missing', 'wonder', 'children', 'Jack', 'Charlie', 'Korsmo', 'Maggie', 'Amber', 'Scott', '8217', 're', 'growing', 'up', 'even', 'Peter', 'no', 'longer', 'remembers', 'Neverland', 'apparently', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'never', 'forgotten', 'what', 'Peter', 'did', 'found', 'way', 'follow', 'Peter', 'real', 'world', 'steals', 'children', 'Hook', 'one', 'better', 'characters', 'movie', 'sidekick', 'Smee', 'late', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', '.Wendy', 'delightful', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Hook', 'determined', 'seek', 'revenge', 'Peter', 'Banning', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'return', 'Neverland', 'save', 'children', '8217', 's', 'when', 'Peter', '8217', 'old', 'friend', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'steps', 'Right', 'here', 'where', 'HOOK', 'first', 'big', 'mistake', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'English', 'loud', 'hyperactive', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'supposed', 'speak', 'using', 'little', 'bell', 'sound', 'face', 'body', 'language', '8217', 'ironic', 'twelve', 'years', 'HOOK', 'came', 'out', 'adaptation', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'got', 'detail', 'right', 'big', 'budgeted', '2003', 'version', 'Jason', 'Issacs', 'Hook', 'Jeremy', 'Sumpter', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'film', 'mistakes', 'HOOK', 'generates.The', 'second', 'mistake', 'Neverland', 'great', 'establishing', 'shot', 'island', 'entirely', 'what', 'was', 'movie', 'set', 'dock', 'where', 'Hook', '8217', 'ship', 'entire', 'movie', 'doesn', '8217', 'look', 'anything', 'else', 'tree', 'home', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'where', 'Indian', 'Tiger', 'Lilly', 'who', 'Peter', 'actually', 'saved', 'original', 'play', 'Spielberg', 'lost', 'opportunity', 'bring', 'character', 'see', 'POV', 'what', 'happened', 'Peter', 'only', 'thing', 'real', 'Captain', 'Hook', '8217', 's', 'ship', '8217', 's', 'also', 'set', 'least', 'actual', 'ship.Peter', 'find', 'way', 'save', 'children', 'defeat', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'Important', 'Message', 'delivered', 'third', 'final', 'mistake', 'ending', 'so', 'long', 'one', 'absolute', 'preachy', 'ending', 'Spielberg', 'filmmakers', 'just', 'can', '8217', 't', 'leave', 'well', 'enough', 'alone', 'three', 'big', 'mistakes', 'still', 'liked', 'part', 'movie', 'opening', 'really', 'good', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'doesn', '8217', 'stop', 'film', 'do', 'many', 'voice-overs', '8217', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'Williams', 'would', 'go', 'prove', 'can', 'do', 'absolutely', 'serious', 'work', 'GOOD', 'WILL', 'HUNTING', 'ONE', 'HOUR', 'PHOTO', 'laughs', 'came', 'Hoskins', '8217', 'Smee', 'things', 'Hoffman', 'was', 'saying', 'Captain', 'Hook.My', 'actual', 'Star', 'Rating', 'would', 'be', '2', 'stars', 'instead', 'three', 'Amazon', 'doesn', '8217', 'allow']",N/A

21122,A2PBV1899CX3TE,0767836324,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 1]","Get the hook! Get the hook! When ""Hook"" came out the buzz was that is was a sub par performance from director Steven Spielberg--an epic flop--but my niece said it was really good, so I gave it a spin. My verdict was that it was pretty good and I enjoyed it. Why did the public stay home in droves?Spielberg's appeal has been and continues to be that he maintains his connection to his inner child. Kids like dinosaurs. So he makes a movie about dinosaurs. Huge blockbuster. Sometimes he manipulates his audience--and the audience is only too happy to be manipulated--until they become aware that the director is manipulating them, and he knows he is manipulating them, and he might also be laughing at them, and how easy they can be manipulated. How dare he? Backlash.Hook, and the whole Neverland, Peter Pan, franchise is all about getting in touch with your inner child. If you believe and think your happy thought, then you can fly! It would seem to be a perfect fit for Spielberg, but it exposes his method. Even Hook knows that he is just a character in a story. During a fight he tells Peter Pan that he is going to wake up and realize that it was all a dream. While watching ""Hook"" the audience realizes that they are being Spielberged, making it harder and harder to hold on to that happy thought. I just made up that word, ""Spielberged"" by the way, but I am sure you know exactly what I am talking about.There was also a backlash against Robin Williams underway at that time that may have contributed to the film's cold reception. Perhaps it was Patch Adams that drove people over the edge, but Williams had taken on too many cute roles and his appeal was starting to grow thin. Since that time he has declared Death to Smoochy and tried for edgier roles. If anyone saw him in ""What Dreams May Come"" they might notice that it bears a lot of similarity with ""Hook"" in that it is rumination on the power of dreams and the imagination, but it is balanced with a darker side. One Hour Photo is perhaps his edgiest role to date, but take August Rush for an example. He plays a Fagin-like character who tries to exploit the musical talent of the lost boys he finds. He has a bit of the Robin Williams whimsy we've all seen in him since the days of Mork and Mindy, but it is balanced by his sinister side, so his character never becomes cloying and overly sentimental. Williams has been trying to find that blend of dark and light with varying degrees of success. I think he got it in ""Hook"" but at the time people were either sick of the too-cute Robin, or not ready for the dark side to be revealed.---------------Peter Banning: You're not old enough to shave! What are you doing with a sword? I've been flying around - This is an insurance nightmare! What is this? Some sort of the ""Lord of the Flies"" pre-school? Where are your parents? Who's in charge here?=====================Once the backlash started, it only picked up momentum with rumors that Julia Roberts--who does she think she is?--as Tinkerbelle was nicknamed 'Tinkerhell' because she was so difficult on the set. Since she spent so much of her screen time hoisted aloft on wires she had a person whose sole job it was to make sure her feet were always clean. Tinkerbelle had a sublet apartment in an empty cuckoo clock and there was a gold MasterCard (or was it Visa?) sitting behind her on an easel. It was kind of cute, in a Spielbergian way, showing how tiny she was, but it was like putting a commercial right smack dab in the movie. Product placement gone amuck. And some people might not want to see a full-sized Tinkerbelle smooching Robin Williams, even if this was a movie about what happens when Peter Pan grows up.Bottom line is ""Hook"" is a very entertaining film with great performances by Dustin Hoffman, as title character Captain James Hook; Robin Williams, as Peter Pan/Banning; Bob Hoskins as First Mate Smee; Maggie Smith, Charlie Korsmo, and the lovely Julia Roberts as Tinkerbelle. It stays true to the original J.M. Barrie material while asking the question: what would happen if Peter did grow up? It was unjustly maligned, but if you keep an open mind perhaps you'll find that you do believe in fairies after all. Kids will enjoy it but there is something for grown ups to think about, too. Watch for cameo performances by Glenn Close, Carrie Fisher, Gwyneth Paltrow, David Crosby, Jimmy Buffet, George Lucas, Phil Collins, and also from the band called Genesis: Mike Rutherford, and Tony Banks. The cast and crew all seemed to be having a great time, even bringing their kids, some of whom also appear in Hook. At one point a complicated scene had to be cut, but Bob Hoskins bought a round of beer for 300 + extras out of his own pocket. With all the fun that went into this film, you can't help but have a little fun watching it.----------Smee: I've just had an apostrophe.Captain Hook: I think you mean an epiphany.Smee: [gestures his

21123,A2OTT4J4JLCL1G,0767836324,"C. Gregory ""C. Gregory""","[1, 2]","Yes, I watched this movie when I was younger (on vhs) I belive I saaw it in the theater but I am not sure. I just remembered having fond memories of it. so when I got it on dvd I was still happy with it, and then when I purchased the blu ray I found that this movie can still make me happy. The overall look of the film, the colors, the intricacies of the detail, all pop out at you as it did when it was first released. The movies from this era have a more tangible feel, as little to no cgi is used, and real sets are the standard not the exception. The characters are fully realized. Hook is a man growing old and wanting to recapture his heyday. Peter has grown up and became responsible. Unfortunately he has forgotten how it is to be young at heart, and his job makes him both a bad parent and a bad husband, though he does love his family. Tinger Bell is the only downer in this movie. I am not really a fan of Roberts. And she does an ok job for this movie. But I feel she was picked because she was the it-girl of the time. She just wasn't the right girl. In my opinion Drew Barrymore would have been better. She might have been younger but she was a fairy, and so the whole ""age"" thing wouldn't have been a factor, had Peter stayed in Neverland he too would still be the same age. I just thought she would have been a better choice, and also has ties to Spielberg from E.T. That being said, this is a fun movie, and it's a movie about taking time. Enjoying every moment, spending those precious few moments we can with the ones we love. And it's about how quickly time passes, and how we all would like something to show for the time we have spent. For Peter that was his wife and kids, for Hook it was his glory days that he could never recapture. Age was not kind to him.The humor is natural and sincere. When the lost boys and Peter have a war of words it seems like a bunch of kids going at it on a playground. Only one can come out on top. And using Peter's kids to get him to fight him again, Hook shows how little he has changed, even though the world around him has. And when Peter's daughter exclaims ""Peter Pan is my dad?"" we all can share in the excitement of Peter returning to form. I did think it curious when Tink calls him a silly ass, considering this was a child's movie (but like most children movies, there is always something in there that the adults might find more interesting than the kids will) but that is true to the book. While many find the reimagining of Peter's world a bit hard to take, this was one of the first movies I saw that did this. Where they take an old story and update it, but leaving the characters who they are supposed to be. Unlike the remake of Romeo and Juliet (starring Dicaprio) this reimagining makes since in the neverland world. This movie proves you are never too old to feel young. The truth of our existence lies in the lives that we touch. For better or for worse and despite our shortcomings there are those in this world who will always love us and need us. Growing up doesn't mean you have to get old. And this movie is timeless. Watch it again, and watch it with friends or with family or a child in your life.

First, while this is a children's movie, it does carry a PG rating and there is some swearing in the movie. If you're the type who categories swearing into ""major"" and ""minor"" swear words, these would all be of the ""minor"" category, but they are there, nonetheless. There are also some darker plot themes here - kidnapping, murder, suicide, guns, sword fights, etc. That might sound bad written out like that, but it's no worse than the Looney Tunes episodes we grew up with.

I watched it again today and I love it still!Peter Pan, having been put up for adoption in the &quot;real world&quot; by Wendy and grown up, is now Peter Panny, a lawyer who is too busy to appreciate his wife and two children, Jack and Maggie. Peter goes to his daughter's play, but is on his cellphone the entire time. He compeltely misses Jack's baseball game, and when Jack is bitter about it and acting childish, Peter tells him to 'grow up.'Then Captain Hook kidnaps Peter's children as revenge, Tink whisks Peter off to Never Never land - where he firmly believes he's hallucinating. He remembers nothing of being Peter Pan, the lost boys, Captain Hook, or anything. In order to save his children, he must find the child within himself.

Maggie Smith is awsome  (and look who plays the young Wendy). Cameos abound to make the viewing  fun, and the performers do well. The visual effects are awsome, flying is  so well done you wonder how he does it, and the first view of NeverLand  demands that you have a Widescreen version of this film... if you choose to  buy it.The plot, briefly, is about an adult Peter living in contemporary  society (just ignore the fact that he would be about 100 years old at this  point... IT'S A FANTASY!). He is a corporate lawyer who is fast losing  touch with his family and himself. A trip to London to see family  brings  back old enemies. Peter must go to NeverLand, fight Hook, and get his  children back. The pirates are suitably grungy and aged, but the Lost Boys  are the biggest letdown. Rather than the collection of late 19th and  turn-of-the-century children you would expect, you get a bunch of  streetwise urchins from any time period up to present day. And, hey, they  don't fly! The movie boils down to the final Pan vs Hook  confrontation.Those claiming the movie is over-violent should look more  carefully. Only ONE person dies. All of the Lost Boys' weapons are the most  non-violent weapons seen. With all the sword-play, no one is even  scratched. It might have been better had there been more loss for the  audience to care about. The movie seems to dwell too long on some parts,  not long enough in others. You watch the movie to get to the moments of  revelation; Peter finding out who he is, seeing NeverLand for the first  time, Peter finding his Happy Thought and what that thought is, him finally  becoming Pan again...The John Williams score is, per usual, top-notch.  The music adds emotional impact at moments when needed, heightening the  mood in others. All of his music is a great ride.If you liked the movie  enough to want to buy it at all, get a clean copy that allows you to see  EVERYTHING. I myself have the Deluxe Widescreen edition of the LaserDisc,  so can only recommend getting the DVD.

21149,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,0767836324,Erik North,"[8, 20]","Aside from ""1941"", HOOK is the only Steven Spielberg I have ever seen that I can comfortably live without in my video collection.  To this day, a little over ten years after having first seen it, my impressions of the film have barely budged at all.  There's lavish sets, huge crowds, spectacular special effects, and a trio of normally first-rate actors--namely Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, and Julia Roberts.  But there is simply no memorable movie-going experience given all this and the man behind the camera.Spielberg has often cited his love for the Peter Pan story, and critics, both friends and enemies alike, have portrayed him as the real-life Hollywood version of Peter Pan.  Thus, it was perhaps inevitable that he would make a film on the legend, resetting it in modern times.  The problem is, however, he spent gargantuan amounts of money (at least $60 million) on sets, stars, and special effects that he forgot to put a real, effective story.Hoffman, under all that make-up, makes for a very devious title character who kidnaps the kids of Peter Pan (Robin Williams), who is now Peter Banning, businessman.  Indeed, Hoffman's performance is one of the highlights of this shockingly inert fantasy film; the legendary Maggie Smith's performance as Wendy is the other.  Williams, normally a comic genius, gets very little to work with here; he is just plain bland.  And Roberts tries to be cute as Tinkerbell, but instead gives probably the tackiest performance of her career.  And the kids who play the Lost Boys are absolutely the most obnoxious bunch!Not even John Williams' great score can save this staggering disappointment from Spielberg.  HOOK only went to show that bigger isn't always better, especially if the story just sits there on the screen and does nothing.  One expects more from Spielberg than this.  Thankfully, he was able to recover yet again, as he had after ""1941"", going on to give us JURASSIC PARK, SCHINDLER'S LIST, and more.",2,A Spielberg Film That Just Sits There--It's Inert,1018051200,"04 6, 2002",2002,1968,"['Aside', '1941', 'HOOK', 'only', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'can', 'comfortably', 'live', 'video', 'collection', 'day', 'little', 'ten', 'years', 'having', 'first', 'seen', 'impressions', 'film', 'have', 'barely', 'budged', 'lavish', 'sets', 'huge', 'crowds', 'spectacular', 'special', 'effects', 'trio', 'normally', 'first-rate', 'actors', 'namely', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'simply', 'memorable', 'movie-going', 'experience', 'given', 'man', 'camera.Spielberg', 'often', 'cited', 'love', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'story', 'critics', 'friends', 'enemies', 'alike', 'have', 'portrayed', 'real-life', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Thus', 'was', 'perhaps', 'inevitable', 'would', 'make', 'film', 'legend', 'resetting', 'modern', 'times', 'problem', 'however', 'spent', 'gargantuan', 'amounts', 'money', 'least', '60', 'million', 'sets', 'stars', 'special', 'effects', 'forgot', 'put', 'real', 'effective', 'story.Hoffman', 'make-up', 'very', 'devious', 'title', 'character', 'who', 'kids', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'now', 'Peter', 'Banning', 'businessman', 'Indeed', 'Hoffman', 'performance', 'one', 'highlights', 'shockingly', 'inert', 'fantasy', 'film', 'legendary', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'performance', 'Wendy', 'other', 'Williams', 'normally', 'comic', 'genius', 'very', 'little', 'work', 'here', 'just', 'plain', 'bland', 'Roberts', 'tries', 'be', 'cute', 'Tinkerbell', 'instead', 'probably', 'tackiest', 'performance', 'career', 'kids', 'who', 'play', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'are', 'absolutely', 'most', 'obnoxious', 'bunch', 'Not', 'even', 'John', 'Williams', 'great', 'score', 'can', 'save', 'staggering', 'disappointment', 'Spielberg', 'HOOK', 'only', 'went', 'show', 'bigger', ""n't"", 'always', 'better', 'especially', 'story', 'just', 'there', 'screen', 'nothing', 'One', 'more', 'Spielberg', 'Thankfully', 'was', 'able', 'recover', 'yet', 'again', 'had', '1941', 'going', 'give', 'JURASSIC', 'PARK', 'SCHINDLER', 'LIST', 'more']",N/A

21155,A1I8F97AHES8YD,0767836324,George Graham,"[3, 3]","I'm starting to think that all of the people who disliked this movie, calling it one of Spielberg's worst, saying it has none of the magic of his earlier films, that it doesn't capture the spirit of the Peter Pan story, is a little bit deranged. I'm not saying this is Steven Spielberg's best film, but apparently watching a guy fight Nazis and a kid find an alien is more magical and reminds someone more of their childhood than the idea of growing up and having to give up on the fun you had as a child (by the way, I love the INDIANA JONES films and E.T.). I've read a lot of the bad reviews of this film, and all of them are written by people who have grown up and apparently become the workaholic who has no time for fun anymore that Robin Williams plays here. Yet they all seem to enjoy Spielberg's other forays into capturing the fun of childhood. I'm not sure what exactly went wrong for them here. Neverland doesn't look right? I don't know how much money was spent here, but I found Neverland to look pretty amazing. Dustin Hoffman is too over-the-top as Hook? Yeah, you're right, Hook should be a real bore. The list goes on and on.Anyway, as many probably know, the plot concerns a grown-up Peter Pan, now Peter Banning (Robin Williams, doing a great job), who has left Neverland and become a workaholic with no time for his kids (like a lot of movies, so maybe that's a complaint of the naysayers). Then suddenly, upon a visit to Granny Wendy's (Maggie Smith), Peter's kids are kidnapped by Lord Voldemort... er, Captain Hook (Hoffman), who wants to rid himself of Peter Pan once and for all. However, Peter has no idea who he once was, so it's up to his old friend Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts... good cast, huh?), who snatches him away to Neverland, and the Lost Boys (apparently another complaint of people... anyone that has any energy in this film gets negativity, it would seem), who are still wild and orphaned. Does Peter become the Pan again and save his kids? Who do you think directed this?I really wish this could be considered one of Spielberg's best, because it's certainly one of my favorites. Spielberg's direction, the acting, John Williams' beautiful score, it all works so well for me.

Perkins ""wide reader""","[1, 1]","SPOILERS FOLLOWI have never understood why Steven Spielberg's ""Hook"" was so thoroughly reviled in the media upon its release.  It is a charming, intelligent, and creative reinvention of J.M. Barrie's ""Peter Pan.""  Granted, it disregards whole swaths of Barrie's original story, and plows on heedless of Mary Martin or Walt Disney.  But, in daring to be different from those predeccessors, director Steven Spielberg puts new creative drive into the story.Starring Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman, the title implies the story is told more from Captain Hook's point of view, and that is somewhat true.  Bubbling under the surface thematically is a more realistic idea encompassing the need to stay youthful in one's mental, emotional and psychological outlook despite the inevitability of growing up.  In essence, the message of ""Hook"" is that all children grow up, but it is in a complete melding of our experiences from youth and our approach to adulthood that determines the tone of our lives.  Robin Williams is perfect in a sort of dual role as a businessman named Peter Banning, and the restored Peter Pan.  Dustin Hoffman is marvelous, offering a modern definitive live-action Captain Hook.Also starring Bob Hoskins as Mr. Smee and Dame Maggie Smith as 'Granny Wendy' Darling, Steven Spielberg's ""Hook"" is a very, very good creative reinvention of a classic tale.",5,"Savaged by critics, Steven Spielberg's ""Hook"" is a very creative reinvention",1325808000,"01 6, 2012",2012,1369,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOWI', 'have', 'never', 'understood', 'why', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Hook', 'was', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'reviled', 'media', 'release', 'charming', 'intelligent', 'creative', 'reinvention', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Granted', 'whole', 'swaths', 'Barrie', 'original', 'story', 'plows', 'heedless', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'daring', 'be', 'different', 'predeccessors', 'director', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'new', 'creative', 'drive', 'story.Starring', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'title', 'story', 'told', 'more', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'point', 'view', 'somewhat', 'true', 'Bubbling', 'surface', 'thematically', 'more', 'realistic', 'idea', 'encompassing', 'need', 'stay', 'youthful', 'one', 'mental', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'outlook', 'inevitability', 'growing', 'up', 'essence', 'message', 'Hook', 'children', 'grow', 'up', 'complete', 'melding', 'experiences', 'youth', 'approach', 'adulthood', 'tone', 'lives', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'perfect', 'sort', 'dual', 'role', 'businessman', 'named', 'Peter', 'Banning', 'restored', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'marvelous', 'offering', 'modern', 'definitive', 'live-action', 'Captain', 'Hook.Also', 'starring', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Mr.', 'Smee', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', ""'Granny"", 'Wendy', 'Darling', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Hook', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'creative', 'reinvention', 'classic', 'tale']",N/A

I actually liked the Lost Boys, especially Rufio, whose whole character I found very interesting. I didn't like the skateboard bits, but if I were a little boy, I might.I absolutely LOVED Hoffman as Hook - he was funny and sinister all at the same time (&quot;I'm going to do it, and don't try to stop me. Smee, don't you dare try to stop me, Smee, try to stop me.  Smee!  Try to stop me, I'm commiting suicide here!&quot;).  Robing Williams is excellent as always, and Pan's children do a fantastic job.

21163,A3H3NI647NBMXL,0767836324,Hobbit Wannabe,"[1, 1]","This movie is a mix of some really awful stuff, some mediocre, and some... just enchanting. My only complaints are the crude humour (which is never good taste), and Julia Roberts, who makes about the worst Tinkerbell I've ever seen. Of course, the ""politically correct"" Lost Boys were somewhat annoying, but I can overlook that part. The special effects weren't spectacular, but were passable.What really makes this movie shine is the talents of Robin Williams, Maggie Smith, and Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman is a brilliant (though ridiculous - in a good way) Hook. Maggie Smith IS Wendy - though she's grown up. And Robin Williams? Well... let's just say that if Peter Pan grew up and became a ""cold, selfish man who drinks too much, is obsessed with success, and runs and hides from his wife and children"", well here he is.I think the problem with this movie is, as another reviewer said, there simply aren't enough people who know the book/play/etc. I found myself grinning as scene after scene contains reference after reference to the true Peter Pan story; having watched the Disney version simply isn't enough. The second problem is that it seems that many reviewers think this movie's supposed to be Peter Pan. It's not. It is, in fact, merely a supposition: what if Peter Pan DID grow up? What if Hood didn't REALLY die? And what if the adult Peter Pan didn't even know who he was?This movie is tons of fun. Again stealing from another reviewer, what makes Robin William's acting so wonderful isn't his role as the crabby, workaholic dad, or even his amazing role as a very Peter Pann-ish Peter. It's his believable transformation. There's no hokey moment of, ""Hey, I really am Peter Pan! Ok, kids, let's go get Hook!"" Instead, he slowly (almost reluctantly) leaves behind Peter Banning and becomes who he once was.One of my favorite moments of the film was when Banning/Pan remembers how to fly. There was just something wonderful about a man re -discovering a world he had been absent from for 30+ years. Think of that! Remembering how to fly after thirty years.

21187,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,0767836324,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[3, 3]","Sometimes I find that it is quite refreshing and fun to revisit movies that I enjoyed as a kid, although at times the end result isn't quite how I remembered it. Some of the time when I revisit a movie that I loved so long ago, I discover that I no longer understand what it was that appealed to me back then. For example, the movie ""Big"" starring Tom Hanks; as a kid I loved this movie, but when I watched it again a couple of years ago on DVD, I couldn't understand what it was about the movie that I had enjoyed so much, other than the scene with the giant piano on the floor. All the humor and fun of the movie escaped me, and maybe it was because I don't have a clear memory of the 80's that I didn't enjoy the movie as much. I grew up in that decade, so I was young when this movie was initially released, therefore certain comedic references don't mean anything to me. One thing is for sure, whenever I do rewatch movies from my past, it's always like a new experience, because since I'm older now, I catch things that I didn't as a child, and the movies make more sense to me and I am able to give them a much more objective look than I did back then. So, when I see a movie that I remember enjoying as a kid and still enjoy it to this day, that is a true treat for me, and one recent example would be the 1991 release of Steven Spielberg's ""Hook"" starring Robin Williams (""Mrs. Doubtfire"") and Dustin Hoffman (""Rain Man"").""Hook"" is the what-if story of what would happen if Peter Pan (Robin Williams) chose to leave Neverland behind, and live out his life as a normal person, therefore growing older and even starting a family. However, just because Peter Pan has grown up and forgotten his many adventures in Neverland, one man hasn't forgotten the boy who could fly, and is determined to exact his revenge once and for all, that man is Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman). After Hook kidnaps Pan's children, Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts) arrives to bring Peter back to Neverland and reintroduce him to the life he had left behind, and with the help of the Lost Boys, hopefully jog his memory so that Peter can once more remember how to fly, how to fight, how to crow, and ultimately how to be Peter Pan once again.As a kid I remembered enjoying ""Hook"" when it arrived in theaters in 1991, so when I had the chance to watch it again recently on TV, I was curious to see whether the film would still hold the magic and wonder that it had for me back then. And I am happy to say that not only was it still as entertaining as it was back then, but I really enjoyed the story even more than I remembered previously. The reason was because I was able to appreciate what the extremely talented Steven Spielberg (""Jurassic Park"") had created by examining the implications of what would happen to Peter if he chose to one day grow up and leave Neverland, and how the character would regain the heroic side of his life that he had forgotten. After I watched the movie again, I found myself wondering why some critics didn't like the film. Was it because they didn't like the 'what if' approach to Peter Pan growing up and forgetting his life in Neverland? Or was it that the somewhat more adult storyline didn't seem to jive with the original kid's story written by J.M. Barrie, at least it didn't in their opinions? Or did they think that for a Robin Williams movie, ""Hook"" just wasn't funny enough, and focused too much on drama and not enough on Robin Williams' obvious mastery of comedy? Whatever the reasons, I'll never understand why some disliked the movie, but I do know that I still enjoy it no matter what they may say.I found the prospect of examining what would happen to Peter outside the realm of Neverland over an extended period of time was quite interesting, and was something that Spielberg and company dealt with in a very real, mature manner. Even though it was a kid's movie, the film contained many adult themes such as fear of losing one's family through selfishness, fear of the strange and unknown, and also rediscovering one's true self that had been buried for so long by the hardships faced in the real world. These elements were spread all over the storyline of the movie, but were done so in such a way that it wasn't overtly obvious, and therefore distracting and confusing to children. However, these elements weren't just treated in such a way that adults would find them insulting either, the mixture of this being a kid's movie, but also a drama with adult themes was handled surprisingly well.The cast was extremely talented, and the two lead actors proved to be the ideal choices for their roles, even though at first glance they didn't necessarily appear to be. I for one wouldn't have thought of Robin Williams as a possibility to portray Peter Pan in any incarnation, but he handles him with just the right blend of drama and humor that made him into an intriguing, ultimately heroic, yet conflicted character. He is a man that wants desperately to save his children, but wants to hide from the possibility that he may have been the savior of Neverland known as Peter Pan, who had abandoned his heroic post so many years before, and that his actions in the past led to his current predicament in the present, and may ultimately change his future forever. Dustin Hoffman was more of an ideal choice to play Captain Hook, and one that frankly made more sense before I had even seen the movie. He gave audiences a Hook that was evil, scheming, and vengeful, but was also lonely and at times suicidal (a surprising aspect to the character, to say the least). To the film's credit, because it was by all accounts intended to be a kid's movie, the topic of suicide as contemplated by Hook, was only briefly touched upon and done so in a humorous way that would not offend or disturb any of the audience. The supporting cast was equally talented, creating characters that were just as memorable as the primary players. Julia Roberts (""Pretty Woman"") as Tinkerbell and Bob Hoskins (""Michael"") as Smee were both incredibly fun to watch, and their interactions with their respective counterparts (Peter Pan and Captain Hook) were some of the most engaging dramatic, and at times humorous, moments in the film. The cast members that comprised the Lost Boys were surprisingly very good for being so young. They played each of their characters as fun loving kids, who knew how to have a good time, but were also aware that theirs was a life full of danger and that one wrong move could mean their end. And rounding out the cast was Maggie Smith ('Harry Potter' series) as the grown up Wendy, who has devoted her life to providing a solid home for orphans and is the person that reintroduces Peter to his heroic past, and puts him on the path to rediscovery and hopefully the safe return of his children.""Hook"" is an extremely fun and interesting film to watch, as it deals with the prospect of what if Peter Pan actually grew up, and what would happen if his past came back to haunt him in a very real and unique way. It's a movie experience that is fun for the whole family, and is full of high-flying action, special effects that were cutting edge in 1991 (surprisingly they still hold up rather well to this day), and an engaging story that brings out the inner child in all of us.""Hook"" is rated PG for violence.",4,What If Peter Pan Grew Up?,1201996800,"02 3, 2008",2008,7335,"['Sometimes', 'find', 'quite',

This is probably Spielberg at his best as he delievers us a comedy that kids and adults can enjoy together. I love this film and something tells me it's never going to go out of style.In this you see the classic characters from J.M. Barrie's book come alive-  In this Peter Pan is all grown up, a work-acholic with a wife and children(who is always letting down). Peter and his family decide to go to London as Grandma Wendy(his wife's grandmother)- ""The Wendy"" is having a ward dedicated in her name at the children's hospital for her dedicated service to orphans. Well, as Peter leaves his children that night to go to the dedication they are kidnapped by the evil Captain Hook who wants a final show-down between himself and Peter Pan. Peter finds himself bewildered at the children's disapperance. That's when Grandma Wendy tells Peter the truth about who is- Peter Pan- only one problem he dosn't remember any of it and thinks he is having a nervous breakdown as he is wisked away to Neverland by Tinkerbelle- a fairy. Peter must prepare for the battle of his life only a couple of problems- he can't remember anything about Neverland, how to fly, or how fight. So how can he save his children from the evil Captain Hook? And how did Peter Pan manage to grow up?Hook seems more evil in the movie than, he ever did in the story or stage-play. Dustin Hoffman brings a certain villianious flare to the screen and had me terrified of what he was going to do the children. Julia Roberts sparkles as a fairy. By far, Robin Williams was the perfect choice for the role of Peter Pan-for I don't think he has ever really grown-up.

21198,A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR,0767836324,"K. M. Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[3, 3]","Contrary to popular misconception, this is not another Peter Pan film. This is very much a ""what if"" film, based upon the premise of what would happen to a Peter Pan, so heavily dependent upon ""never growing old"", if he were to grow old and forget his past. It makes an interesting contrast to the oft-repeated Peter Pan story.Peter Banning (Robin Williams) is an obviously successful businessman, specializing in corporate hit and run raids it seems. In a depressingly common situation, he is slowly alienating his lovely wife Moira (Caroline Goodall) and children, due to his increasing obsession with his work. He also seems to be slowly forgetting his roots as an orphan, saved by Granny Wendy (Maggie Smith), the grandmother of his wife. So when he returns to England with his family to attend the dedication of a new wing at a children's hospital in Wendy's honour, he seems to be less focused on family than he should be. But he is shocked out of his monomania by the kidnapping of his children, by none other than Captain James Hook (Dustin Hoffman), and even more shocked when Wendy forces him to understand that he is actually the Peter Pan and that he has to go after the children. Slowly getting pickled on some alcoholic sustenance, he is further forced to confront his past when Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts) arrives to drag him off to Never Neverland. No mean task for a guy who has forgotten everything about how he used to fly and why he did it anyway. Suffice it to say, he heads off to Never Neverland where the inevitable (less than successful) rekindling of relationships with Captain Hook and The Lost Boys takes place, with Tinkerbell and The Lost Boys taking on the task of trying to get Peter to remember everything about his past so that we can have the climatic battle between good and bad.As long as one approaches the film not expecting a retelling of the classic Peter Pan story, then I have always felt that this was a decent piece of family fun, mixed with a decent dollop of good old family values. To return to it on DVD in all its widescreen glory is a delight after years of surviving on a rather mediocre VHS tape. There is obvious enthusiasm for the project from all concerned here, as the film moves along at a quite decent pace, despite its two hour plus length. The story could perhaps have been aided by a little judicious pruning here and there, but the cast have done a commendable job with what they were given to work with. Robin Williams is his usual sterlingly reliable self in the lead role, without going over the top - which would have been quite easy to do methinks. I have always found this a rather refreshingly different performance from Dustin Hoffman (he copped a Golden Globe nomination for it) and for some reason find him completely convincing as the Hook trying to recapture something that has long gone. The less said about Julia Roberts here the better, although it must have been difficult in a role where basically you would have been doing everything solo for insertion later into a shot. The highlight for me though is Bob Hoskins. Obviously the film is heavily based upon effects work at times, and to be honest the work is showing up its age a little now. However, it remains a rather decent piece of effects work overall.",3,A decent piece of family fun,1107129600,"01 31, 2005",2005,3288,"['Contrary', 'popular', 'misconception', 'not', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'what', 'film', 'based', 'premise', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'heavily', 'dependent', 'never', 'growing', 'old', 'were', 'grow', 'old', 'forget', 'past', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'oft-repeated', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'story.Peter', 'Banning', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'obviously', 'successful', 'businessman', 'specializing', 'corporate', 'hit', 'run', 'raids', 'depressingly', 'common', 'situation', 'slowly', 'alienating', 'lovely', 'wife', 'Moira', 'Caroline', 'Goodall', 'children', 'due', 'increasing', 'obsession', 'work', 'also', 'be', 'slowly', 'forgetting', 'roots', 'orphan', 'saved', 'Granny', 'Wendy', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'grandmother', 'wife', 'So', 'when', 'England', 'family', 'attend', 'dedication', 'new', 'wing', 'children', 'hospital', 'Wendy', 'honour', 'be', 'less', 'focused', 'family', 'should', 'be', 'shocked', 'monomania', 'kidnapping', 'children', 'none', 'other', 'Captain', 'James', 'Hook', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'even', 'more', 'shocked', 'when', 'Wendy', 'understand', 'actually', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'go', 'children', 'Slowly', 'getting', 'pickled', 'alcoholic', 'sustenance', 'further', 'forced', 'confront', 'past', 'when', 'Tinkerbell', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'drag', 'off', 'Never', 'Neverland', 'mean', 'task', 'guy', 'who', 'forgotten', 'everything', 'how', 'used', 'fly', 'why', 'did', 'anyway', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Never', 'Neverland', 'where', 'inevitable', 'less', 'successful', 'rekindling', 'relationships', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'place', 'Tinkerbell', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'taking', 'task', 'trying', 'get', 'Peter', 'remember', 'everything', 'past', 'can', 'have', 'climatic', 'battle', 'good', 'bad.As', 'long', 'one', 'film', 'not', 'expecting', 'retelling', 'classic', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'story', 'then', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'decent', 'piece', 'family', 'fun', 'mixed', 'decent', 'dollop', 'good', 'old', 'family', 'values', 'return', 'DVD', 'widescreen', 'glory', 'delight', 'years', 'surviving', 'rather', 'mediocre', 'VHS', 'tape', 'obvious', 'enthusiasm', 'project', 'concerned', 'here', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'quite', 'decent', 'pace', 'two', 'hour', 'length', 'story', 'could', 'perhaps', 'have', 'been', 'aided', 'little', 'judicious', 'pruning', 'here', 'there', 'cast', 'have', 'done', 'commendable', 'job', 'what', 'were', 'given', 'work', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'usual', 'sterlingly', 'reliable', 'self', 'lead', 'role', 'going', 'top', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'easy', 'do', 'methinks', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'rather', 'refreshingly', 'different', 'performance', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'copped', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nomination', 'reason', 'find', 'completely', 'convincing', 'Hook', 'trying', 'recapture', 'something', 'long', 'gone', 'less', 'said', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'here', 'better', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'role', 'where', 'basically', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'everything', 'solo', 'insertion', 'later', 'shot', 'highlight', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Obviously', 'film', 'heavily', 'based', 'upon', 'effects', 'work', 'times', 'be', 'work', 'showing', 'up', 'age', 'little', 'now', 'However', 'rather', 'decent', 'piece', 'effects', 'work', 'overall']",N/A

Ross ""Kristy""","[7, 9]","The only oddity in the Spielberg cannon, Hook sticks out like a sore thumb from the director's output during the late 80s to early 90s. Critically mauled on its release, the film has been seen by some intelligent critics as an underrated film that, with closer inspection, isn't as bad as most critics thought. Robin Williams is Peter Banning, the corporate Wall Street businessman type who was once Peter Pan, but who has long since forgotten all about his childhood. Then along comes Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) to kidnap Peter's kids and take them to Neverland. Peter is then faced with having to remember who he is so he can rescue his kids. Grannie Wendy: ""You must try to remember"" Peter: ""Remember what?""The Spielberg themes are clearly displayed in the first half hour with the busy father never managing to spend time with his kids. And bits and pieces of the classic Pan tale were seen in E.T. Here the director's trademark visuals and astounding imaginative ideas are spread all throughout the film. One scene in particular, where Peter's kids are ""hook-napped"", where we see the ""light"", once used to touching effect in Close Encounters, here symbolising fear. John William's brilliant score underlays the themes and emotions, producing a great soundtrack to accompany the film.Then it's off to Never Never Land, where Peter must try to remember who he is to save his kids. The problem is, once the film gets to the fantasyland, events get somewhat clustered with a number of overly loud visuals. And despite some great lines between Williams and Hoffman, the film tends to slip into sentimentality often, and Williams gives an uneasy, stilted performance as Peter when he is trying to remember. Sure, the effects are great and the strong Spielberg themes are nice, but until the finale (where we are greeted with a huge battle between good and evil, classic Spielberg), the film drags on for some time with some uneasy emotions and action.The principal acting is good, with Hoffman barely recognisable but portraying the title character to good effect. Williams, although not his usual one-liner comic self, is at least an enjoyable character once he reverts back to being Peter Pan. Bob Hoskins (Who Framed Roger Rabbit) plays the character of Hook's assistant Smee with relish. The only disappointment is Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell. The casting is unusual however, in that Spielberg's films usually make stars like Harrison Ford and Sam Neill, but here, working with established stars, Spielberg's vision is over-clouded by a bunch of big-name actors. But the sets, visuals, music and class storytelling redeem the film, and although it's not one of the director's best, it's still an enjoyable adventure.",3,"Hook, hook, give us the Hook!",1021075200,"05 11, 2002",2002,2723,"['only', 'oddity', 'Spielberg', 'cannon', 'Hook', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'director', 'output', 'late', '80s', 'early', '90s', 'Critically', 'mauled', 'release', 'film', 'been', 'seen', 'intelligent', 'critics', 'underrated', 'film', 'closer', 'inspection', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'most', 'critics', 'thought', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Peter', 'Banning', 'corporate', 'Wall', 'Street', 'businessman', 'type', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'who', 'long', 'forgotten', 'childhood', 'Then', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'kidnap', 'Peter', 'kids', 'take', 'Neverland', 'Peter', 'then', 'faced', 'having', 'remember', 'who', 'so', 'can', 'rescue', 'kids', 'Grannie', 'Wendy', 'must', 'try', 'remember', 'Peter', 'Remember', 'what', 'Spielberg', 'themes', 'are', 'clearly', 'displayed', 'first', 'hour', 'busy', 'father', 'never', 'managing', 'spend', 'time', 'kids', 'bits', 'pieces', 'classic', 'Pan', 'tale', 'were', 'seen', 'E.T', 'Here', 'director', 'trademark', 'visuals', 'astounding', 'imaginative', 'ideas', 'are', 'spread', 'film', 'One', 'scene', 'particular', 'where', 'Peter', 'kids', 'are', 'hook-napped', 'where', 'see', 'light', 'once', 'used', 'touching', 'effect', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'here', 'symbolising', 'fear', 'John', 'William', 'brilliant', 'score', 'themes', 'emotions', 'producing', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'accompany', 'film.Then', 'Never', 'Never', 'Land', 'where', 'Peter', 'must', 'try', 'remember', 'who', 'save', 'kids', 'problem', 'once', 'film', 'fantasyland', 'events', 'get', 'somewhat', 'clustered', 'number', 'overly', 'loud', 'visuals', 'great', 'lines', 'Williams', 'Hoffman', 'film', 'slip', 'sentimentality', 'often', 'Williams', 'uneasy', 'stilted', 'performance', 'Peter', 'when', 'trying', 'remember', 'Sure', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'strong', 'Spielberg', 'themes', 'are', 'nice', 'finale', 'where', 'are', 'greeted', 'huge', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'classic', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'drags', 'time', 'uneasy', 'emotions', 'action.The', 'principal', 'acting', 'good', 'Hoffman', 'barely', 'recognisable', 'portraying', 'title', 'character', 'good', 'effect', 'Williams', 'not', 'usual', 'one-liner', 'comic', 'self', 'least', 'enjoyable', 'character', 'once', 'back', 'being', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'character', 'Hook', 'assistant', 'Smee', 'relish', 'only', 'disappointment', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Tinkerbell', 'casting', 'unusual', 'however', 'Spielberg', 'films', 'usually', 'make', 'stars', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'here', 'working', 'established', 'stars', 'Spielberg', 'vision', 'over-clouded', 'bunch', 'big-name', 'actors', 'sets', 'visuals', 'music', 'class', 'storytelling', 'redeem', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'director', 'best', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'adventure']",N/A
21200,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0767836324,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 2]","I was totally enthralled by the dazzling remake of J.M. Barrie's classic story of the boy who did not grow up that came out in 2003 from director P.J. Hogan, and there are some magical moments in 204's ""Finding Nverland"" when we finally get to opening night. So I thought maybe it was time to go back and reconsider Steven Spielberg's 1991 film ""Hook."" In this version it turns out that Peter Pan did grow up. He fell in love with Wendy's granddaughter, Moira, decided to stay in our world, and does not remember anything that happened before the age of 12. With heavy-handed irony, Peter turns out to be a corporate raider (in other words, a pirate), who not only does not remember what it is like to be a child, he also ignores his own children. However, that all changes when Captain Hook makes his way to Granny Wendy's London home and kidnaps Peter's two children, Jack and Maggie. Tinkerbell shows up to help Peter remember who he is and take him to Never-Land to save the day.A lot of Spielberg's films deal with the theme of the absent father and clearly a key part of ""Hook"" is that Peter, the father, remembers not only his true self but his own children. But the film does not provide the sense of magic we expect from Spielberg and I want to make the argument that the problem is not so much the story as it is the casting. You simply cannot have Robin Williams in a movie like this and not expect him to be Robin Williams, which means that several key scenes get spun in a way that is not necessarily in the best interest of the story. Throw into the mix Dustin Hoffman having fun playing Captain Hook, Bob Hoskins having almost as much fun playing Smee, and Julia Roberts as a very talkative Tinkerbell, and you have a lot of star power running around on screen.The problem for me is what happens to Rufio, King of the Lost Boys, because that event changes the whole equation at play here. Because of what happens Peter cannot let Captain Hook off the hook, yet that is exactly what he does. I suppose it was too much for either Peter Pan or Robin Williams to do what had to be done in those circumstances, but this forces the film to come up with a way to have the right thing happen, albeit it in a comic way, without Peter having to get his hands dirty. Still I came back to what happened to Rufio and as the end game plays out in Never-Land I know in my heart that this is just not right.The idea that the casting of the principles is off is confirmed for me when we get back to London town. The reaction of Caroline Goodall's Moira when her children come back and Maggie Smith's performance from start to finish as Granny Wendy seem to me to be grounded in the film that this one should have been.

21207,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,0767836324,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[9, 10]","This is a brilliant movie. Peter Pan has always been one of my favourite stories, and I still have the same J.M. Barrie book I had as a child, which continues on the story, with John & Michael growing up, and saying what everyone else was doing. I always skipped the rest of the story, and read the ending.Peter Pan is now grown up, into the 'pirate', who ignores his wife and kids, to concentrate on an all important job. He's played brilliantly here by Robin Williams, a less comedic role for him this time. Also playing the old Wendy, is a fantastic actress by the name of Maggie Smith. She can turn her hand to anything, and still be wonderful. Tinkerbell is surprisingly played by Julia Roberts, which is quite strange. (Her nickname on the film set was apparently Tinkerhell) There's something not quite right about her playing Tinkerbell. For starters she looks nothing like the Tinkerbell more well known from the Disney movies, and when she becomes a 'big' Tinkerbell, and tells Peter she loves him, it's extremely unbelievable.There are a lot of cameos in this movie, which I discovered by looking at the cast list. Gwyneth Paltrow is one of the more noticeable ones, in a blink-a-few-times-and-you'll-miss-her role. The kissing couple who begin to float when some fairy dust lands on them are actually George Lucas and Carrie Fisher in a cameo. The pirate shut in the chest with the scorpion was played by Glenn Close - I'll have to re-watch that scene, as it looks nothing like her! Also appearing in a tiny role is Phil Collins - weird I know, he plays a policeman.Apart from the two extremely bratty children, what really annoyed me was the fact only Tootles was the only original Lost Boy in it. (If I remember correctly, did Wendy not take them all home with her at the end of the book? I haven't read it in years!) The other Lost Boys were: Slightly, Nibs, Curly, and the unnamed Twins.John Williams does a terrific score to this, but mostly, it matches the scene at the time, and isn't very memorable after you've finished watching it. (That means don't play it to me, and try to make me guess it next time!)Dustin Hoffman makes a great Hook. He's totally evil, although slightly OTT and camp at the same time! He has the right blend to make it just right. And Smee (Bob Hoskins) is fantastic! He's so funny! There are two great lines that he comes out with in this. These are:Smee: I've just had an apostrophe.Captain Hook: I think you mean an epiphany.Smee: No... lightning has just struck my brain.Captain Hook: Well, that must hurt.and the bit where he's running about, just before he gathers up all the gold, where he's looking for Smee - who's him!Watching this film on DVD, I found it had really aged. You can see the white lines, especially when they're flying, around the characters, and although I still love this movie, and give it four out of five, it just doesn't have the same magic as when you're young.On the DVD is the usual: trailers, still galleries, interviews, featurettes, and a very weird set top game, which I can't get my head around.If you can pick up this DVD cheap (I got it for 2.99, which I'm still shocked about), then it's well worth it.

It's grandiose and flagrant; pompous and pondering, but the heart of the story still maintains an impact:  don't forget what it's like to be young.  Robin Williams does a stoic job as the adult Peter Pan, but it was hard for me to see him as a swashbuckling hero; I think Spielberg also took a little too long for Peter's acknowledgement of who he is and that he can fly.  Dustin Hoffman, one of the most consummate performers we've had, seems to be enjoying himself immensely in the role of Captain Hook, and he does a sterling job as always.  Julia Roberts' Tinkerbell is a little too cloyish and schmaltzy, but she doesn't hurt the film.  Bob Hoskins is delightful as Smee and Maggie Smith glows as Wendy.  I hated John Williams score; it sounded like all his other ones and at times I wish they had kept the music out it became so redundant.

He is an incredible talent but I'm sorry I, like Siskel and Ebert before me (and many other people), just don't like this movie. It's not that it's awful, it's just not very good and generally forgettable I'm afraid to say. Okay it's got a stellar cast (Dustin Hoffman, Robin Williams, Julia Roberts and Bob Hoskins etc.) but it really fails to catch the imagination of either kids or adults (and even Spielberg reportedly conceded this).You'd have to ask whether it was a good idea in the first instance to make Peter Pan an adult in what is essentially a kid's story in this unfortunate adaptation of the classic JM Barrie tale, that just doesn't work. What was wrong with the original story that they had to change it? if it aint broke then don't try to fix it is the old addage that Spielberg should have heeded but on top of this the film is even, dare I say it, technically ropey. I mean is it just me or do the movie sets look like movie sets and isn't the script amazingly poor by the great maestro's standards? The cast can't save it either, they're all fine but essentially wasted and is it any coincidence that this movie went 40 days over its 76 day shooting schedule, during a particularly turbulent time in Julia Roberts life (does anyone remember Kiefer Sutherland?). Don't get me wrong I'm not blaming Ms Roberts for the movies failure.

Peter is all grown up with a wife and two children living a normal life. When he goes to London to visit Wendy who found him a family when he had none, Hook steals his children. Peter has forgotten all about Neverland. Tinker Bell (Julia Roberts) who still adores Peter Pan comes to the rescue and flies him back to Neverland. He cannot fly anymore because he has forgotten how. Hook is sadly disappointed to find that Peter is all grown up and has forgotten how to play, much less fight. Tinker Bell has three days to get Peter Pan back in shape. He has been gone a long time and the Lost Boys have a new leader Rufio. They do not believe that Robin Williams is Pan the Man.My favorite scene was the food fight. It was funny and a great idea. In order to have food you have to imagine what you want to eat, and there it is. If you lose your imagination, you will just be hungry. I love the mermaids. They look so real. Tinker Bell is my favorite character because she is the cutest pixie ever. She is small, could fly and has an adorable house. Captain Hook is the best I have ever seen. He is funny yet has a mean streak. Snead (Bob Hoskins) the Captain's assistant is played perfectly and Hook would be no where without him. Steven Spielberg makes another movie which has me laughing, crying and cheering. There are the coolest sets. The great pirate ship, the Lost Boys hideout and Tinker Bell's space are all done with great detail. Everything looks real and I wanted to jump through the screen and learn how to fly and live there for a while. It looks like I always imagined it would. Second star to the right and fly on until morning. The costume designers and make-up artists are outstanding. They do a believable job of making all characters look perfect.

21241,A1LDIMQISH07WK,0767836324,Rebecca,"[2, 4]","I just don't understand why all the professional film critics have to put down HOOK. This is my favorite version of Peter Pan and Captain Hook - I find it even better than Disney's animated film, PETER PAN! It definitely is enjoyable with a cleaver script, and it's fast-paste so it doesn't drag on slowly.This film takes place when Peter Pan (Robin Williams) is all grown up. He is now known as Peter Banning and has a wife and two kids. Peter is the kind of guy who loves his work. He tries to spend time with his family but his work keeps getting in the way. Then he and his family goes to London to visit Granny Wendy (Maggie Smith) because Peter is going to make a speech on Granny Wendy's accomplishments, which was to have a hospital for homeless orphan children built. When they get to London, Granny Wendy tells Peter that he is actually Peter Pan, even though he doesn't believe her. When Peter, his wife, and Granny Wendy are at the party, Captain Hook (Dunstin Hoffman) comes back because he learns that Peter Pan is back in London and kidnaps Peter's children, Jack and Maggie! Peter is soon met by Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts) who tells him that Captain Hook has kidnapped his kids and he must go off to Neverland to save them. When Peter gets to Neverland, it's an adventure he'll never forget - especially when he comes across the Lost Boys who've got a new leader and he has to prove to them that he is really Peter Pan so they can help save his children.HOOK is one of the best fantasy/adventure films of all time. Some parts are very hilarious, too. I never get tired of watching this film. The whole family will enjoy it! With an all-star cast including Robin Williams, Dunstin Hoffman, Maggie Smith, Julia Roberts, and many more...how could you go wrong? Gwyenth Paltrow even makes a cameo role as young Wendy. If you haven't seen this already, then it's not to be missed! The fight sceen between Peter Pan and Captain Hook at the end is awesome, too.

Much like the 2003 Peter Pan which I panned as well because the starring Peter looks like a dirty lost boy, this is on the other end of the scale as a middle aged Peter who simply cannot remember his past. The stage production looks entirely fake much as Robin Williams Popeye, which I even like better than this. There is the overly sentiment which tries desperately to make Peter a deep thinking individual. BORING. And the ridiculous scene of Peter regaining his thoughts and powers only to careen in like a flying invisible bicycle is utterly stupid.Bob Hoskins is well cast as Mr. Smee but ends up doing nothing. Julie Roberts was even nominated as worst actress, and it shows as yet another straggled haired Tinker Belle with no magic other than the special effects crew. There are no great songs, and this should have been a musical because it looks it, but Spielberg opted to burden it with many excruciating action sequences that are not even intriguing as they are noisy. And it one particular scene of a very bad lost boy having vulgar words with the forgetful Peter is nothing short of disgusting for the Peter Pan legacy. Thank god there is a live actor that once worked at Disneyland who's name is similar to Spielberg by coincidence that has given the true meaning of what Peter Pan really is.

21251,AM4ZQJ0IORVWG,0767836324,"Rob ""Revuman""","[8, 9]","For a movie going on lucky 13 years old, it's still as fun to watch as it was the first time I saw it in the theaters. Peter Banning is a well off American lawyer married to the great grandaughter of Wendy Moira Angela Darling...Mora Darling. He also has two kids, Jack and Maggie. However, supporting for his family has become a full time job and as such he's forgotten all about having an imagination, playing with his kids, spending time with his family, and enjoying his life. And in the middle of all of this, there's Capt. James S. Hook, life long enemy of Peter Pan (Banning, though unbeknownst to him). In an act of vengeance, he kidnaps Banning's kids in the night, and tinkerbell comes home to bring Peter back to Never Neverland and make Peter remember the life he left behind and the fight that was never finished.Mr. Spielberg went all out on this movie, and it shows. There's a lot of heart and soul here from the pirate ships to the lost boys hideout to London and back again. At the same time, there's a lot of heart in both the screenplay and the actors embodiment of the characters. I don't think there will ever be a Hook as good as the one that Dustin Hoffman has done in this film, Bob Hoskins is always a pleasure to watch and his comedic timing is near perfect, causing everything from a slight chuckle to uproarious laughter to pass your lips after each scene he's in, and William's Peter Banning/Pan, while extrodinarily silly and misguided at times, comes around brilliantly, and the first time you watch him fly you can't help but grin from ear to ear.The child talent is always a risky business, but if you accept that the kids are not going to be the best actors in the world, you realize that most of them do the script justice, whether they know they are or not. Charlie Korsmo, along with Dante Basco, are clearly the most talented, carrying their scenes with Williams and Hoffman very well.John Williams score is as wonderful as it ever was (you can hear some of the framework for the Harry Potter music in this particular score)...And finally, there's the message...""never grow up"". It's the same message from the original movie, but how it gets there is slightly different. As we watch Peter Banning remember and relive the life he left behind, we realize what he realizes; growing old doesn't mean you have to grow up...and you have to live...for that is the ""great adventure"".At 2 hours and 20 minutes, the movie drags here and there a bit from time to time. And on no fault of the original production, the special effects of the film have not held up as well as they could have in the last 13 years. The movie is starting to look it's age. But I think no matter how old this movie gets, there will always be people who will be taken back by the simple premise of this movie and embrace it for the wonderful way it's taken the original Peter Pan story to a whole new level...and beyond.",5,One man and the search for his inner child...a great message,1089504000,"07 11, 2004",2004,2923,"['movie', 'going', 'lucky', '13', 'years', 'old', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'theaters', 'Peter', 'Banning', 'well', 'American', 'lawyer', 'married', 'great', 'grandaughter', 'Wendy', 'Moira', 'Angela', 'Darling', 'Mora', 'Darling', 'also', 'two', 'kids', 'Jack', 'Maggie', 'However', 'supporting', 'family', 'become', 'full', 'time', 'job', 'such', 'forgotten', 'having', 'imagination', 'playing', 'kids', 'spending', 'time', 'family', 'enjoying', 'life', 'middle', 'Capt', 'James', 'S.', 'Hook', 'life', 'long', 'enemy', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Banning', 'though', 'unbeknownst', 'act', 'vengeance', 'Banning', 'kids', 'night', 'tinkerbell', 'home', 'bring', 'Peter', 'back', 'Never', 'Neverland', 'make', 'Peter', 'remember', 'life', 'left', 'behind', 'fight', 'was', 'never', 'finished.Mr', 'Spielberg', 'went', 'out', 'movie', 'lot', 'heart', 'soul', 'here', 'pirate', 'ships', 'lost', 'boys', 'hideout', 'London', 'back', 'again', 'same', 'time', 'lot', 'heart', 'screenplay', 'actors', 'embodiment', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'Hook', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'done', 'film', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'always', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'comedic', 'timing', 'perfect', 'causing', 'everything', 'slight', 'chuckle', 'uproarious', 'laughter', 'pass', 'lips', 'scene', 'William', 'Peter', 'Banning/Pan', 'extrodinarily', 'silly', 'misguided', 'times', 'around', 'brilliantly', 'first', 'time', 'watch', 'fly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'grin', 'ear', 'ear.The', 'child', 'talent', 'always', 'risky', 'business', 'accept', 'kids', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'best', 'actors', 'world', 'realize', 'most', 'do', 'script', 'justice', 'know', 'are', 'not', 'Charlie', 'Korsmo', 'Dante', 'Basco', 'are', 'clearly', 'most', 'talented', 'carrying', 'scenes', 'Williams', 'Hoffman', 'very', 'well.John', 'Williams', 'score', 'as', 'wonderful', 'ever', 'was', 'can', 'hear', 'framework', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'music', 'particular', 'score', 'finally', 'message', 'never', 'grow', 'up', 'same', 'message', 'original', 'movie', 'how', 'slightly', 'different', 'watch', 'Peter', 'Banning', 'remember', 'relive', 'life', 'left', 'behind', 'realize', 'what', 'growing', 'old', ""n't"", 'mean', 'have', 'grow', 'up', 'have', 'live', 'great', 'adventure', '2', 'hours', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'here', 'there', 'bit', 'time', 'time', 'fault', 'original', 'production', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'have', 'not', 'held', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'last', '13', 'years', 'movie', 'starting', 'look', 'age', 'think', 'matter', 'how', 'old', 'movie', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'back', 'simple', 'premise', 'movie', 'embrace', 'wonderful', 'way', 'taken', 'original', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'story', 'whole', 'new', 'level']",N/A

Penola,"[6, 24]","This movie is SO disappointing, in so many ways -- it never delivers on the promise instantly created by putting Peter Pan and Steven Spielberg, our own dream-weaver, together.  The Never-Land you see here is so crass,  it looks cheap and part of a Disney theme-park rip-off.  Robin Williams  displays his usual energy, but the role is horribly underwritten.  The  inclusion of hip Lost Boys who skate-board and wear punk clothing seems  badly mis-informed; these characters should never, ever be contemporary as  in TODAY -- they exist in a magical, if sad, place where they will never  change.  And Julia Roberts flutters in for a few strange, and, for me,  upsetting scenes, in which Tinkerbell becomes human-scale.  Dustin Hoffman  has no fun with his Hook, who is so preeningly self-aware that he becomes  instantly annoying.  Children will be bored out of their skulls.

I was wondering the same thing so I took the chance that this wasn't a poor quality Blu-ray transfer and purchased it.  I'm very happy I did!  The first big differece you will see on the Blu-ray version is a beautiful animated main menu.  This replaces the washed out still photo type menu you remember from the standard DVD version.  Once you get into the movie itself you will be amazed at the dramatic difference in picture quality of the transfer.  Now instead of a washed-out upconverted standard def picture you will enjoy eye-popping clear crisp colorful images of Peter, the Lost boys, Tink, Captain Hook, and the rest.  The sound has been upgraded too.  Watching Hook in Blu is like seeing a whole new movie.  It looks like a film that was made yesterday.  An extra little perk is that this is a 2 disk set, 1 Blu-ray and 1 standard def version of the moive are included.  So if you're a true fan of Hook you MUST have it in Blu!

However I noticed a few flaws; the setting of neverland looks more like a movie set, Hook was well played, but his lines could have been written better, and that took most away from his threating image, the lost boys seemed too lost to understand how to act like there from neverland and not a junior high school.

That is the whole point. It was filmed to be an update. That's why the Lost Boys play basketball and ride skateboards. To me, that was a small price to pay for a fun flick. By now, you all know the premise is a grown up Peter Pan `lost' in the world of grown-ups. A-HA! See the correlation? One of Robin William's best roles (he is better in serious roles than slappy stuff...see Bicentennial Man). He has lost sight of his true self, and it takes the kidnapping of his children by Hook (Hoffman is excellent) to recapture what we all lose as we get older....the ability to let us loose our inner child.Spielberg makes a very obvious point in this film. If we lose the ability to enjoy our lives as children do, we become stiff, stolid, and joyless. We become destined to discuss the weather, politics, and banal crap.So that's all I wanted to post here. Enjoy this film, with whatever flaws it may have, as a piece filled with Spielberg magic.

Huston,"[0, 0]","After a play, a cartoon, and a tv series about one of the greatest stories ever created in history, we are finally rewarded with a ""live-action"" film that brings the world of Peter Pan to life and gives us the greatest emotional experience of all time!Okay, I will admit, I was laughing at the idea that this movie even existed.  I mean, ""Peter Pan, all grown up, married, and has kids"", that wasn't the original Peter Pan that I knew at all.  I at first thought it was a bad idea that this movie was even made and I made fun of it.  But then... I found out that Steven Spielberg himself directed the movie and everything changed.  I watched it and I my mouth hang open from shock after the movie was over.  ""Hook"" is one of the greatest adaptions ever created in the history of Peter Pan!The story is very simple.  Peter Pan has grown up, having fallen in love with a girl named Moira, who happens to be the granddaughter of the now elderly Wendy Darling.  Having married Moira and had two kids, our hero has forgotten his time in Neverland and has become a regular person. But when Hook returns and kidnaps his children, Peter must return to Neverland, regain his memories, and team back up with the Lost Boys in order to save his children, while finally face his deadliest nemesis for the final time.With the work of the greatest director of all time, Steven Spielberg, Hook turned out to be one of the greatest movies of all time.  Steven Spielberg delivers his version of Peter Pan and shows us what happens when the ""boy who wouldn't grow up"" actually grows up.  Dustin Hoffman plays a great villain inside Hook, bringing his evil side to life and also showing us what he would be like in real life if he was real.  Robin Williams delivers his best performance as a older Peter Pan, showing us his life without Neverland.  Maggie Smith and Gwyneth Paltrow create such awesome versions of Wendy Darling, who has lived a full life and has us tearing up at how things used to be in the old days.The emotion inside this story is so heartfelt and beautiful, you will literally cry.  Rufio, the Lost Boys (including elderly Tootles), Wendy, Tinkerbell, and even Peter himself make the best moments of this movie so worth watching.  Old characters like Wendy and Tootles will have you missing the old times when they were all young and going on adventures with Peter.  Rufio and the Lost Boys provide the greatest fun and adventures for us to watch and be entertained by.  And Peter will give you the most greatest story about learning to deal with your past and moving on.  Just his old saying ""to die would be awfully big adventure"", he now understands that ""to live would be an awfully big adventure"".  You will be loving the emotion from all around the movie.This film was done so beautifully and amazingly, that we are able to call this ""the greatest Peter Pan movie of all time""!This movie is very highly recommendable for Peter Pan fans.  You will not be disappointed! Even kids will love it too! :)",5,It's Steven Spielberg at his very best!

21275,A3SFN5013RD3U0,0767836324,Terry Downey,"[2, 2]","I love grownup versions of classic children's stories, such as ""Ever After"" (a grownup Cinderella) and this movie, ""Hook"", a very grown-up Peter Pan.  ""Hook"" takes a sobering look at the downside of being ""grownup""- our propensity for taking ourselves and our responsibilities far too seriously, forgetting how to have fun along the way, and how it harms our relationships with our families, especially our children.  Robin Williams as the grown-up Peter shows what a truly good actor he is in this movie, and that his comic genius is but one of his talents.  Dustin Hoffman, always a show-stealer, does not disappoint.  His ""Hook"" is at once funny and a very scary guy, at one point even killing the leader of the Lost Boys - this is definitely not your kids' Peter Pan.  The supporting cast do an excellent job as well.The visuals are imaginative and engaging, such as the child-pleasing bright crayon-colored foods at their banquets, and serve to remind us of how life is different through the eyes of a child - Bright green ketchup?  Cool! - and what fun it was to ""think outside the box"" before it was educated and conformed out of us.  Hook himself remembers this, and uses this knowledge to steal Peter's disillusioned son away from him, an act of revenge that forces Peter to re-learn the art of having fun in order to rescue him from the despicable Hook.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.On a more serious note, ""Hook"" is a cautionary tale to which many of us ""grownups"" need to pay close attention, living in a society as we do that places (or should I say ""misplaces"") so much emphysis on providing material goods - the newest, the biggest, the brightest, the best of everything - that we are in real danger of neglecting the one and only thing our kids really need - our time - time for guidance, time for teaching, time for discipline, and time for just plain fun.  Hook is very real, and he manifests himself in terrifying ways - drugs, alcohol, sex, and the human predators that offer these to our children on a daily basis.  I am very glad I bought this video, because I can take it out and watch it any time life gets too serious and I need a reminder of what is really important.",5,Grownup fun with a serious side...,1062547200,"09 3, 2003",2003,2197,"['love', 'grownup', 'versions', 'classic', 'children', 'stories', 'such', 'Ever', 'grownup', 'Cinderella', 'movie', 'Hook', 'very', 'grown-up', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Hook', 'sobering', 'look', 'downside', 'being', 'grownup', 'propensity', 'taking', 'responsibilities', 'far', 'too', 'seriously', 'forgetting', 'how', 'have', 'fun', 'way', 'how', 'relationships', 'families', 'especially', 'children', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'grown-up', 'Peter', 'what', 'truly', 'good', 'actor', 'movie', 'comic', 'genius', 'one', 'talents', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'always', 'show-stealer', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Hook', 'once', 'funny', 'very', 'scary', 'guy', 'one', 'point', 'even', 'killing', 'leader', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'definitely', 'not', 'kids', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'supporting', 'cast', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'well.The', 'visuals', 'are', 'imaginative', 'engaging', 'such', 'child-pleasing', 'bright', 'crayon-colored', 'foods', 'banquets', 'serve', 'remind', 'how', 'life', 'different', 'eyes', 'child', 'Bright', 'green', 'ketchup', 'Cool', 'what', 'fun', 'was', 'think', 'box', 'was', 'educated', 'conformed', 'Hook', 'remembers', 'knowledge', 'steal', 'Peter', 'disillusioned', 'son', 'away', 'act', 'revenge', 'Peter', 're-learn', 'art', 'having', 'fun', 'order', 'rescue', 'despicable', 'Hook', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'serious', 'note', 'Hook', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'many', 'grownups', 'need', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'living', 'society', 'do', 'places', 'should', 'say', 'misplaces', 'so', 'much', 'emphysis', 'providing', 'material', 'goods', 'newest', 'biggest', 'brightest', 'best', 'everything', 'are', 'real', 'danger', 'neglecting', 'one', 'only', 'thing', 'kids', 'really', 'need', 'time', 'time', 'guidance', 'time', 'teaching', 'time', 'discipline', 'time', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'Hook', 'very', 'real', 'terrifying', 'ways', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'sex', 'human', 'predators', 'offer', 'children', 'daily', 'basis', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'bought', 'video', 'can', 'take', 'out', 'watch', 'time', 'life', 'too', 'serious', 'need', 'reminder', 'what', 'really', 'important']",N/A

At one point in the movie Wendy is reading from the actual Peter Pan book that J.M. Barrie wrote.  I'm wondering if J.M. Barrie had anything to do with the writing of this movie as well.Even though this movie has a message that fathers should spend more time with their family, it doesn't really get in the way.  The movie is still adventurous and actually gives you the feeling that Neverland is a real place.I really like the scene where they have the imaginary feast.  When Peter actually sees the food in front of him, it really is wonderful.  I think that scene pretty much sums up this whole movie.I swear, if J.M. Barrie didn't write this, I'd like to know who did.  They must have been pretty darn talented, because this movie is great.  I think it's as good or better than any of the Peter Pan films, including the animated Disney one, and classic animated Disney films are tough to beat.  The lost boys in Hook are a lot more wild than the VERY tame lost boys in the animated film, and I think it gives Hook an added sense of realism.This film has a great musical score too.  Obviously, since it's by John Williams.  Although John Williams did do the score for Daddy-o also, which wasn't all that great.Robin Williams delivers another great performance that'll entertain adults and kids alike.

It's a shame, really, because it has so much going for it.The basic idea is terrific -- Captain Hook will wreak vengeance on Peter Pan by alienating the affections of his children -- which Peter is well on the way to doing, anyway (his son, at least). And it's perfectly cast, with an almost-unrecognizable Dustin Hoffman underplaying Hook, and Charlie Korsmo & Amber Scott as Peter's children.What scuttles (ar, ar) the whole thing is the Wretched Excess of the production. A fundamentally simple story is drowned in extravagant sets whose design appears to have been dictated by the availability of a huge budget, rather than imagination or appropriateness. Neverland not only resembles an /adult's/ idea of what children find fanciful or fantastical, but it's downright /cheap-looking/, despite the millions of dollars obviously spent on it. Disney does this sort of thing much better, and Spielberg would have been well-advised to solicit advice.There's little to say about John Williams' typically tedious, repetitive, and unimaginative score -- except that it's tedious, repetitive, and unimaginative. One can only imagine what Jerry Goldsmith or Alex North would have done.The worst thing is that there's no real emotional catharsis at the end. Spielberg isn't able to draw even a /glycerine/ tear.Although the film's 2:24 length is justified by the need to fully develop the characters and their situations, it's too long for children under 13 or 14, who probably wouldn't understand what's going on, anyhow. And there are a couple of on-screen deaths.PS: In the baseball sequence, the pirate player with a wooden leg is LongJohn Adlhoch, an acquaintance.

The story is based around Peter Panning (Williams) Name sound familiar? well it is Peter Pan only 40 years old. Peter left Neverland and forgot who he was and eventually began to age and forgot about his childhood. Work becomes Peter's first priority over his marriage and his family which isn't a good thing. Determined to make Peter remember who he is Tinkerbell (Roberts) comes to collect Peter and remind him of who he truly is.Once in neverland we are first introduced to the scary and imposing figure that is Captain James Hook (Hoffman) and his trusty sidekick Smee (Hoskins). As the story progresses of Peter being brough back to neverland we see the painful task of reminding Peter who he is so he can go into one final battle with Captain Hook. Apart from Hook, Peter has one adversary to overcome first and that's Rufio (Dante Basco) the new leader of the Lost Boys since Peter's absence.Because of Peter's neglegance of his children his son Jack is easily persuaded to join Captain Hook along with his little sister and this is a true low blow for Peter.I have already said too much but all's i'm going to say is you'll love this film as much as i did.
