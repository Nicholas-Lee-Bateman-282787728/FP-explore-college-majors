They smell and taste  like the X-Files, Twilight Zone, Outer Limits and Dark Shadows, with a nod of the hat to the classic Kolchak The Night Stalker.When Dan Curtis produced this show in the 1970's, the show had an edge of the occult-it was so mysterous. Then there was Files and many shows like it.The new Carl Kolshak, played by Stuart Townsend, seem so too cool for the role, not like Darrin McGavin did in the 70's. He drives a hip car with police scanner,  nice pressed clothes rather than a wrinkled suit nand over equiped for every mysteryThis Kolchak show seems to act more and more like Fox Mulder, than a hard hitting news reporter. His back story acted like the Fugitive, with the supposed killing of his wife as part of his Mythos.Gabrielle Union , who plays  Perri the ""senior crime reporter"" who has worked at the LA Beacon for all of four years, seems wasted in her role  of second Banana to Townsend's Kolchak. Union is a good actress normally. However she is NO SCULLY, trust me...she acts like eye candied, girl wonder to Kolchak..and fails badly. There could have been mjore fleshiness to her character, other than the one dimension she shows here.Lets say the acting is good NOT great and the storylines are bad VERY bad. Most of you WILL feel as if you watched them before...X-Files fans take note, YOU ARE EXCUSED from watching...files did a better job!The show lasted six episodes of TV. When it was merrifully pulled for ABC TV, the show  had 4 episodes unaired .

975739,A3FL2SSZ980NOY,B000EOTV98,"Braithwaite ""W.""","[7, 12]","Okay: this is not the Night Stalker.  That was ABC's, and the producer Frank Spotnitz, first mistake.To link it with the Darren McGavin classic was idiotic.  It was clearly more a spinoff of the X-Files than the Night Stalker.  Stuart Townsend was no Carl Kolchak.  He was Fox Mulder who was in serious need of anti-depressants.  I mean he made Mulder seem happy.That is not to say the show did not have potential.  It did. There were some genuinely creepy moments and some good episodes in this short-lived thriller.  And I'll give it this: you didn't need to guess that something supernatural was going on.  No subtlety here.  It hit you in the head like a 2x4.  Which happened to work in this case.  The ""Jimmy Olsen"" tag along kid was a good touch.  They should have lost the cynical chick who tagged along for the ride.  And there was absolutely no rapport between Anthony Vincenzo and the new Carl.They should have released this as: That reporter sleuth of the supernatural featuring ""Carl Kane"" and ""Jimmy Olsen"".  A little more thinking; and a good idea the writers knew where they were going; and you may have had a great atmospheric show that would still be on today.  Many times, these writers ask question after question after question, but clearly do not have any answers.  They just keep asking questions; and hope nobody notices.  Think ""Lost"" knows where it is going,--guess again.  I hope I am wrong, but I doubt the writers of ""Lost"" know what the end game of their show will be.  I'll be surprised if I am wrong.  The Pretender was the same; and the writers of the much acclaimed ""Nowhere Man"" series actually admitted they were better at asking questions than answering them.So I had the same feeling with this version of the Night Stalker.  It's all about story; and unfortunately, the entertainment industry (movies and television both) have forgotten that.  After 100 years, and countless remakes, the industry is in a coma.  It will continue on for awhile; but do not expect much in the way of entertainment--unless you want to watch a classic from the past.  Forget Bewitched the movie; buy Bewitched the t.v. show.  If that is what you like.I'll stick with the two television movies and 20 episodes of ""Kolchak: the Night Stalker""; and leave this remake for others who do not know any better.I have heard the Scifi channel may be airing these in the future.  The show may not be completely dead yet.  Maybe given a little more time, the small potential I saw, may get a chance to blossom into something different and better--but never Carl Kolchak: the Night Stalker.  Darren McGavin (may he rest in Eternal Peace in the PRESENCE OF THE LIVING & TRIUNE GOD) will always be Kolchak.  That era has past, along with him.In CHRIST JESUS: THE LORD GOD INCARNATE!!!Braithwaite*Gospel of John Ch. 1; John 3:16-18; John 14:1-9; Acts 4:12; Romans 10:9-10*",3,The Night Stalker Light!,1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,2872,"['Okay', 'not', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'was', 'ABC', 'producer', 'Frank', 'Spotnitz', 'first', 'link', 'Darren', 'McGavin', 'classic', 'was', 'idiotic', 'was', 'clearly', 'more', 'spinoff', 'X-Files', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'was', 'Carl', 'Kolchak', 'was', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'who', 'was', 'serious', 'need', 'anti-depressants', 'mean', 'made', 'Mulder', 'seem', 'happy.That', 'not', 'say', 'show', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'potential', 'did', 'were', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'moments', 'good', 'episodes', 'short-lived', 'thriller', ""'ll"", 'give', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'guess', 'something', 'supernatural', 'was', 'going', 'subtlety', 'here', 'hit', 'head', '2x4', 'happened', 'work', 'case', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'tag', 'kid', 'was', 'good', 'touch', 'should', 'have', 'lost', 'cynical', 'chick', 'who', 'tagged', 'along', 'ride', 'was', 'absolutely', 'rapport', 'Anthony', 'Vincenzo', 'new', 'Carl.They', 'should', 'have', 'released', 'reporter', 'sleuth', 'supernatural', 'featuring', 'Carl', 'Kane', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'little', 'more', 'thinking', 'good', 'idea', 'writers', 'knew', 'where', 'were', 'going', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'great', 'atmospheric', 'show', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'today', 'Many', 'times', 'writers', 'ask', 'question', 'question', 'question', 'clearly', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'answers', 'just', 'keep', 'asking', 'questions', 'hope', 'nobody', 'notices', 'Think', 'Lost', 'where', 'going', 'guess', 'again', 'hope', 'am', 'wrong', 'doubt', 'writers', 'Lost', 'know', 'what', 'end', 'game', 'show', 'will', 'be', ""'ll"", 'be', 'surprised', 'am', 'wrong', 'Pretender', 'was', 'same', 'writers', 'much', 'acclaimed', 'Nowhere', 'Man', 'series', 'actually', 'admitted', 'were', 'better', 'asking', 'questions', 'answering', 'them.So', 'had', 'same', 'feeling', 'version', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'story', 'unfortunately', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'movies', 'television', 'have', 'forgotten', '100', 'years', 'countless', 'remakes', 'industry', 'coma', 'will', 'continue', 'awhile', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'much', 'way', 'entertainment', 'want', 'watch', 'classic', 'past', 'Forget', 'Bewitched', 'movie', 'buy', 'Bewitched', 't.v', 'show', 'what', 'like.I', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'two', 'television', 'movies', '20', 'episodes', 'Kolchak', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'leave', 'remake', 'others', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'better.I', 'have', 'heard', 'Scifi', 'channel', 'may', 'be', 'airing', 'future', 'show', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'completely', 'dead', 'yet', 'Maybe', 'given', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'small', 'potential', 'saw', 'may', 'get', 'chance', 'blossom', 'something', 'different', 'better', 'never', 'Carl', 'Kolchak', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'Darren', 'McGavin', 'may', 'rest', 'Eternal', 'Peace', 'PRESENCE', 'THE', 'LIVING', 'TRIUNE', 'GOD', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'Kolchak', 'era', 'past', 'him.In', 'CHRIST', 'JESUS', 'LORD', 'GOD', 'INCARNATE', 'Braithwaite*Gospel', 'John', 'Ch', '1', 'John', '3:16-18', 'John', '14:1-9', '4:12', 'Romans', '10:9-10*']",Night Stalker - The Complete Series

Unfortunately, didn't get a chance to see this air, so I picked up the boxed set when it came out.Simply put, this was a poorly made series.  Tries to reimagine the 70's show and attempts to be more intelligent and hip, fails dismally in all 3 (as opposed to say the ""Battlestar Galactica"" 80's original remake which I found to be pretty good).  The stories and plot were excruciatingly dragging and, well, ridicuous (For example, the antagonists in the Pilot episode appeared to be monster coyotes who could levitate, had a penchant for sniffing out pregnant women and devouring their fetuses, and who also had the ability to lift beds while flying and kidnap children!). I blame the scriptwriters for this.  The monotonous piano theme music which permeated throughout the series didn't help (would've been hip in the 90's, not now).  This show pales in comparison to contemporary TV Horror shows like ""Supernatural"".Still, there were pros.  Stuart Townsend and cos' acting was okay.  Guest shot of Darren McGavin in the Pilot was a nice tribute to the old show and pretty rewarding for old time fans.

975749,A1NY3KGW9CVGXN,B000EOTV98,DR BOB,"[2, 2]","The best way to watch this series (especially if you have affection for the original Kolchak) is to disregard any connection to the 1970's show. There is little resemblance between the two except the names of some characters. Just take this new version as a series about reporters investigating mysterious deaths and unexplained events. If these episodes smell a lot like the ""X-Files,"" that's no real surprise since most of the writers and producers worked on that show.My personal bias is that I prefer answers to mysteries that are posed (at least eventually), and this series provides few. Granted the plug was pulled before some storylines could be resolved, but often I felt the writers were trying to be intentionally vague or just too lazy to come up with a fully realized story.On the positive side, the series is well acted and beautifully shot. The episodes are suspenseful and diverting if you don't mind some ambiguity. The two commentaries on the set are interesting and worth a listen.Here are my mini-reviews of the ten episodes (with grades):PILOT: Introduces somber reporter Kolchak, whose wife died under mysterious circumstances, and his team of colleagues. A series of gory deaths lead them to track strange creatures in the desert. Briskly paced with some genuinely chilling moments. Watch for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it ""cameo"" by Darren McGavin, the one, true Kolchak. B+THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HELL: A prisoner in solitary confinement is able to psychically influence people on the outside to commit terrible acts. A surprisingly effective episode that has a nice twist at the end (even though you see it coming). A-THREE: People begin dying from their worst fears. A dull story that falls back on the worn device of using ghosts as an excuse to show a bunch of ""scary"" imagery. CBURNING MAN: Someone is sending figurines that cause the recipients to burst into flames. Not a particularly novel plot, this episode goes light on the supernatural element and leaves a key question unanswered. B-MALUM: Bad things befall people who cross paths with a young boy and his sinister father. The central mystery is not terribly mystifying and, even worse, is not particularly riveting. B-THE SOURCE: Kolchak pursues a man who may have answers he seeks about his wife's death, while a gang of zombie bikers shoots up everyone in sight. More action-packed than usual. BTHE SEA: Conclusion of THE SOURCE in which Kolchak and Co. protect a woman from the ghostly Hell's Angels. Some nice action, but again too few answers are offered (So what's with those zombie bikers anyway?) to leave the viewer feeling truly satisfied. B-INTO NIGHT: Kolchak tries to uncover what's turning people into mummies. There are a few frights along the way, but the story is strangely uninvolving. At least there is a halfway plausible explanation for the events. B-TIMELESS: Young women are murdered and mutilated, and Kolchak suspects someone is using them as a source of eternal youth. The premise is unoriginal, but this episode manages to wring some unsettling moments from it. Guest starring the ""French chick"" from ""Lost"" in another bizarre role. B+WHAT'S THE FREQUENCY, KOLCHAK?: One of those maddening episodes that is all set up and no payoff. Kolchak is kidnapped and held captive in a plot that's part ""Misery"" and part ""The Thing at the End of the Hall."" The suspense builds effectively, but the frustrating final act brings no resolution.

So it was with groans of dismay that viewers greeted ""Night Stalker,"" a remake of the classic horror/humor/scifi series.Fortunately, the resulting series is not actually that bad. But unfortunately it's not that good either -- it has little in common with the original series, but it never establishes a style or identity for itself either. As a result, it comes across as ""Mulder and Scully working at the Beacon.""A pregnant housewife is kidnapped and found horribly mutilated in the desert. Perri Reed (Gabrielle Union) is assigned to the task, but soon finds herself working with Carl Kolchak (Stuart Townsend), a strange reporter whose wife died in a manner identical to the murdered housewife. Only when Perri starts to believe in Kolchak are they able to find who did it.In the weeks that follow, Kolchak and Perri encounter many bizarre crimes --  a killer who can manipulate people's minds, a college hazing becomes ensnared in a ghost's terror, a dead bioterrorist seems to be killing again, demonic possession, and apocalyptic bikers.Additionally, there are four episodes that had been filmed when ABC yanked the plug on this one. The first wraps up the storyline of a two-parter, and then it's back to the weird and wild: mummified office workers, Kolchak is kidnapped, and an episode based on the ""Night Strangler"" TV movie.Don't expect any resemblance to ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" here. Kolchak is no longer an eccentric lone wolf, but a pouty crime expert with a comely sidekick, who is very conventional and skeptical. No humor. No mythic creatures. And apparently a love of truth is not enough to motivate Kolchak -- the creators gave him a rather hackneyed ""revenge"" motive.Yeah, it sounds like the ""X-Files."" Even the FBI persecuting Kolchak seems too X-Filesian, not to mention the presence of The Pretty Skeptic Lady, and the Kindly And Tolerant Superior Who Puts Up With Weird Reports. It was made by the same people who made ""X-Files,"" but couldn't they have varied the formula a little?Taken on its own, ""Night Stalker"" is a fairly entertaining series -- there are some wonderfully spooky moments, such as the scene in the werewolf cave. Dialogue is pretty average. And though the shakycam style is a little annoying, the camerawork is quite nice -- eerie lighting and pulsing streets make the city look surreal, nightmarish and almost alive.Townsend and Union are both pretty good in their roles. Not great, but good. Townsend is at his best in ""interview"" scenes, where he gets up close and personal with everything from a crazed murderer to a frightened little girl. He's a bit wooden in the more emotional scenes, while Union is steady but never gets a chance to show any more depth.""The Night Stalker"" is a fairly enjoyable series -- though it never comes close to the original -- but it suffers from the ""X-Files"" formula.

ABC is notorious for axing good shows right before they start and ""Night Stalker"" wasn't any different. Ignore the other reviews panning this series. It was actually very good.The acting by Stuart Townsend, Gabrielle Union and the rest of the cast was EXCELLENT. The stories had a mix of the supernatural and regular drama. Stuart as Kolchak is being investigated for the death of his wife but along the way of cf clearing his name he investigates violent and mysterious cases. I would also like to say for the idiots who say this is an X-Files ripoff to do your homework. The X-Files was not the first show to deal with aliens in a serious form can you say ""War Of the Worlds from 1988"". Actually as well the other cancelled CBS show ""Threshold"" was more closer to the X-FIles that this show. ""Night Stalker"" was also part cop show, and not only a show on supernatural.The ratings were a problem but ABC like to juggle this show around hoping it would fail putting it one bad timeslot to the next. They just never gave this show a chance, and if you doubt if these show has fans you to go some of the SciFi boards on the net and you'll notice that it's gotten quite a following.In the DVD release you get to see the rest of the unaired episodes that would have aired but didn't.

The 2005 series the Night Stalker is a very well written and well acted show.  That is probably why it failed on broadcast TV.  This Carl Kolshak, played expertly by Stuart Townsend, is a man haunted by the mysterious and brutal death of his wife.  He was there when she was killed, and no one really believes him as to how she was killed.  Many think Carl is a murderer, but they can not prove it.  This spiritual/emotional/psychological tension in apparent in most of the episodes.  It casts a shadow on all that Carl does, especially his relationahips with co-workers.  Some of the episodes have resolutions, but some do not. This makes the show really kind of edgy and true to life.  Why do so many TV show writers think all of life's problems can be solved in a 45 minute time slot?  The best episodes deal with the ""monsters"" concept, but others are just serial killers.The acting is excellent.  Gabrielle Union is fabulous as Perri the ""senior crime reporter"" who has worked at the LA Beacon for all of four years.  Besides being a great actress, Gabrielle Union is simply beautiful.  Perri struggles to try to fingure out what is going on in the cases they investigate, but also she tries to understand why Carl does what he does.The newspaper's photographer is another interesting character.  He tags along with Perri and Carl on many investigations.  This threesome is rather unique in television and adds to the quality of th show.  Unfortunately, the photographer's name is very hard to catch.  It is Jain, sounds like Jane, for a man, really unusual.  Why did the writer's do that?The background music is suitable and sets the tone well.

975761,A2D9IEFJGB483Q,B000EOTV98,Kendal B. Hunter,"[26, 50]","The Kolchak Redux series, I believe, exemplifies what's wrong with the entertainment media: ""Re-imagining "" classic TV series in a hipper, fashionable, sexier, and more politically correct format.  This grave-robbing and desecration has been done with the Fantastic Four, Dukes of Hazzard, Star Trek, and Battlestar Galactica.  In the process of revising and  revamping a classic series, the essential charm is always lost.The Redux series involved two sins. First, this is not Kolchack: he was always an outsider. He is a washed-up forty-something reporter as uncool as his seersucker suit and straw porkchop hat.  The NuKolchak, however, was too hip, too classy in his Abercrombie & Fitch SlayerWear.Also, Kolchak was a loner. You could never picture him as married, or working with someone.  In fact, the relationship between NuKolchak and Perri was a smudge reproduction of Mulder and Scully, but more on that later.The second sin is more of a miscalculation on the producer's part.  Back in the 70's, the only supernatural programming we got, besides the silver-age horror films, was ""Night Gallery,"" ""Project Bluebook,"" the Bigfoot episodes of Bionic Man, and ""In Search Of . . ."" (narrated by Leonard Nemoy).  By virture of this scarcity, Kolchak stood out among the Clone Army of cop program (SWAT, Barretta, Charlie's Angels, Police Woman, and, um, Kojak).Nowadays, everyone has a working knowledge of the paranormal.  Frank Spotnitz  and Daniel Sackheim are victims of the success of the ""X-Files,"" which brought the paranormal into the mainstream. Added to this, you have the incessant Bigfoot-UFO documentaries on TLC and Discovery, the TV series Roswell, the new Archie cartoon, and the overnight radio ""Coast to Coast AM.""  In other words, the paranormal market is supersaturated, and has therefore become clich? and utterly boring.  Kolchak's off-beatness has become the sounding drum of all TV.On these two accounts-the ambush makeover for Carl and the lack of uniqueness-doomed the series.  Admit it: the real problem was that the show was a poser for Kolchak, but ultimately pulled a ""bate and switch"" and gave us ""X-Files: Los Angels.""  By the way, if they had cast this series as an X-Files spin-off, it probably would have fared much better. The fans of BOTH original series-Kolchak and X-Files-would be happier, and the series could cut its own way, without the seersucker suit baggage.",2,Grave-robbing,1146268800,"04 29, 2006",2006,2408,"['Kolchak', 'Redux', 'series', 'believe', 'what', 'wrong', 'entertainment', 'media', 'Re-imagining', 'classic', 'TV', 'series', 'hipper', 'fashionable', 'sexier', 'more', 'politically', 'correct', 'format', 'grave-robbing', 'desecration', 'been', 'done', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'process', 'revising', 'revamping', 'classic', 'series', 'essential', 'charm', 'always', 'lost.The', 'Redux', 'series', 'involved', 'two', 'sins', 'First', 'not', 'Kolchack', 'was', 'always', 'outsider', 'washed-up', 'forty-something', 'reporter', 'as', 'uncool', 'seersucker', 'suit', 'straw', 'porkchop', 'hat', 'NuKolchak', 'however', 'was', 'too', 'hip', 'too', 'classy', 'Abercrombie', 'Fitch', 'SlayerWear.Also', 'Kolchak', 'was', 'loner', 'could', 'never', 'picture', 'as', 'married', 'working', 'someone', 'fact', 'relationship', 'NuKolchak', 'Perri', 'was', 'smudge', 'reproduction', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'more', 'later.The', 'second', 'sin', 'more', 'miscalculation', 'producer', 'part', 'Back', '70', 'only', 'supernatural', 'programming', 'got', 'silver-age', 'horror', 'films', 'was', 'Night', 'Gallery', 'Project', 'Bluebook', 'Bigfoot', 'episodes', 'Bionic', 'Man', 'Search', 'narrated', 'Leonard', 'Nemoy', 'virture', 'scarcity', 'Kolchak', 'stood', 'out', 'Clone', 'Army', 'cop', 'program', 'SWAT', 'Barretta', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'Police', 'Woman', 'um', 'Kojak', 'everyone', 'working', 'knowledge', 'paranormal', 'Frank', 'Spotnitz', 'Daniel', 'Sackheim', 'are', 'victims', 'success', 'X-Files', 'brought', 'paranormal', 'mainstream', 'Added', 'have', 'incessant', 'Bigfoot-UFO', 'documentaries', 'TLC', 'Discovery', 'TV', 'series', 'Roswell', 'new', 'Archie', 'cartoon', 'overnight', 'radio', 'Coast', 'Coast', 'AM', 'other', 'words', 'paranormal', 'market', 'supersaturated', 'therefore', 'become', 'clich', 'utterly', 'boring', 'Kolchak', 'off-beatness', 'become', 'sounding', 'drum', 'TV.On', 'two', 'accounts-the', 'ambush', 'makeover', 'Carl', 'lack', 'uniqueness-doomed', 'series', 'real', 'problem', 'was', 'show', 'was', 'poser', 'Kolchak', 'ultimately', 'pulled', 'bate', 'switch', 'gave', 'X-Files', 'Los', 'Angels', 'way', 'had', 'cast', 'series', 'X-Files', 'spin-off', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'fared', 'much', 'better', 'fans', 'BOTH', 'original', 'series-Kolchak', 'X-Files-would', 'be', 'happier', 'series', 'could', 'cut', 'own', 'way', 'seersucker', 'suit', 'baggage']",Night Stalker - The Complete Series

Over 95% of these negative comments are from people who are offended that this ""remake"" completely abandons the original ""Kolchak the Night Stalker"".Well, I'm glad it did.I realize that the original series has a sizeable cult fanbase. I can respect that. But that fanbase grew up with the show and watched it in the 70s. It's now 2005, and the fact that the original failed in the 70s should obviously tell you that it's not going to work in 2005.The new Night Stalker chooses psychological horror, rather than the original's overuse of showing the monsters and creatures. This show makes its characters believable, not silly like the original. This show is an even darker version of ""The X-Files"", but in some ways better.Like I said before, this series uses mainly psychological horror to frighten it's viewers. What I find funny is the fact that everyone insults supernatural shows on television because they're not creative enough, they use stuff the viewer SEES to scare them, etc., and when a show comes along to scare viewers with what's NOT necessarily seen, it's rejected.Anyway, the new Night Stalker is a visual feast, using advanced HD cameras that create a realistic feel to the show. Everything on screen looks fantastic. The cast is both attractive and capable, all of them are established actors and make their characters likeable.Like ""The X-Files"", this show has a mythology. Only instead of investigating an alien invasion, ""Night Stalker"" has it's lead investigating the meaning of a red snake-shaped mark on the wrists of certain victims, which usually die by supernatural means, but, other than that, appear to be unrelated. At the end of the pilot we discover that Carl, who started investigating the mark after the violent, brutal death of his wife, also bears the mark on his wrist.I do believe that this show could have succeeded. It was a slick, suspenseful thriller that could have become the next X-Files, but ABC banished it to a terrible time slot, Thursdays against CSI, The Apprentice, Everwood, etc. The show also received NO off-network advertising, since the network pumped everything into ""Commander-in-Chief"". Despite this, enough viewers tuned in to the premiere that the show could have at least lasted one entire season, but after the premiere ABC advertised the show even LESS, not reminding people it was on, yet they still heavily advertised every new episode of Desperate Housewives and Lost, although the viewers of those established shows are obviously going to keep tuning in.If you're a horror fan, this new reimagining of Night Stalker is a must-see.",4,"A Good, Scary Show",1148860800,"05 29, 2006",2006,2717,"[""'m"", 'sure', ""'ve"", 'heard', '2005', 'version', 'Night', 'Stalker', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'negative', 'things', 'said', '95', '%', 'negative', 'comments', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'offended', 'remake', 'completely', 'original', 'Kolchak', 'Night', 'Stalker', '.Well', ""'m"", 'glad', 'realize', 'original', 'series', 'sizeable', 'cult', 'fanbase', 'can', 'respect', 'fanbase', 'grew', 'up', 'show', 'watched', '70s', 'now', '2005', 'fact', 'original', 'failed', '70s', 'should', 'obviously', 'tell', 'not', 'going', 'work', '2005.The', 'new', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'psychological', 'horror', 'rather', 'original', 'overuse', 'showing', 'monsters', 'creatures', 'show', 'characters', 'believable', 'not', 'silly', 'original', 'show', 'even', 'darker', 'version', 'X-Files', 'ways', 'said', 'before', 'series', 'mainly', 'psychological', 'horror', 'frighten', 'viewers', 'What', 'find', 'funny', 'fact', 'everyone', 'insults', 'supernatural', 'shows', 'television', ""'re"", 'not', 'creative', 'enough', 'use', 'viewer', 'SEES', 'scare', 'etc.', 'when', 'show', 'along', 'scare', 'viewers', 'what', 'NOT', 'necessarily', 'seen', 'rejected.Anyway', 'new', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'visual', 'feast', 'using', 'advanced', 'HD', 'cameras', 'create', 'realistic', 'feel', 'show', 'Everything', 'screen', 'looks', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'attractive', 'capable', 'are', 'established', 'actors', 'make', 'characters', 'X-Files', 'show', 'mythology', 'Only', 'instead', 'investigating', 'alien', 'invasion', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'lead', 'investigating', 'meaning', 'red', 'snake-shaped', 'mark', 'wrists', 'certain', 'victims', 'usually', 'die', 'supernatural', 'means', 'other', 'appear', 'be', 'unrelated', 'end', 'pilot', 'discover', 'Carl', 'who', 'started', 'investigating', 'mark', 'violent', 'brutal', 'death', 'wife', 'also', 'mark', 'wrist.I', 'do', 'believe', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'succeeded', 'was', 'slick', 'suspenseful', 'thriller', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'next', 'X-Files', 'ABC', 'banished', 'terrible', 'time', 'slot', 'Thursdays', 'CSI', 'Apprentice', 'Everwood', 'etc', 'show', 'also', 'received', 'off-network', 'advertising', 'network', 'pumped', 'everything', 'Commander-in-Chief', 'enough', 'viewers', 'tuned', 'premiere', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'lasted', 'one', 'entire', 'season', 'premiere', 'ABC', 'advertised', 'show', 'even', 'LESS', 'not', 'reminding', 'people', 'was', 'yet', 'still', 'heavily', 'advertised', 'new', 'episode', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'Lost', 'viewers', 'established', 'shows', 'are', 'obviously', 'going', 'keep', 'tuning', 'in.If', ""'re"", 'horror', 'fan', 'new', 'reimagining', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'must-see']",Night Stalker - The Complete Series

What is sadly lacking in these updates - Yes, I am aware this is a dressed up clone of another Spotnitz series - is a sense of humor. Even at his most morose, Duchovny's character was able to lob a couple of fast ones at Scully which would be received with her standard deadpan scowl. The original Kolchak did not take itself too seriously and Spotnitz and crew could learn a lesson or two from that. All things considered, there were a handful of fine episodes in it's short run. Unfortunately, while Townsend and Union are photogenic they both lack the nuances of a great character actor like McGavin. It probably isn't fair to examine either of the two series through the prism of thirty years of change but the original series has a charm all its own which will not be easily emulated by modern refashioning and atmospheric camera work.

975779,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000EOTV98,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[56, 63]","Grissom from ""CSI"" needs to be called in on this unusual homicide. It seems that a network ABC mysteriously killed a show that they wanted. It appears that they just pushed it in front of the runaway hit ""CSI"" but there could be much more to the murder than meets the eye. Remaking a classic whether it be good or bad is always tricky business because you risk alienating the original fans and can be unable to pull in a new audience. ""Battlestar: Galatica"" is a rare success in the area ""reimagining"" the concept for a more sophisticated audience. That show has polarized fans of the original they either love it or hate it but producer/writer Ron D. Moore shaped a new series from older material that captured a solid audience because of its intelligent scripts and well written drama. Frank Spotnitz a producer/writer on ""The X-Files"" and ""Millennium"" takes the inspiration for those shows ""The Night Stalker"" and ""The Night Strangler"" TV movies as well as the humor laced camp classic TV show that followed and unsuccessfully updated it for today's audience by imitating the shows they inspired. While the show failed to live up to its potential it improved by leaps and bounds over time and showed potential after emerging from the shadow of its inspiration. It's possible the show may never of had much of an audience as Spotnitz alienated core fans of the original cheesy but fun TV series (these same people probably never realized that ""The Night Stalker"" began life as a serious modern day horror movie with humor vs. a humorous show with horror). For what it's worth ""The X-Files"" took much of the first year to find its groove and I believe that ""Night Stalker"" would have improved. After the promising pilot episode the show took a downward turn but began to improve again just as ABC pulled the plug. While actor Stuart Townsend can't hold a candle to Darren McGavin's charismatic performance in the original TV movies and the TV series (one of its saving graces) he does a credible job as does most of the cast.As befits a new TV series ""Night Stalker"" looks quite good in this transfer. The gritty, detailed images from the TV show have never looked so good. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround audio sounds nice with the dialogue and music coming through with crystal clarity. My only reservation is that the entire series run of ten episodes plus the extras and commentary tracks have been packed on two single sided dual layered discs. The Show looks extremely good even with 5 episodes packed onto each of the two discs and with commentary tracks, deleted scenes and a featurette ""A Conversation with Frank Spotnitz"" included on the set.""Night Stalker"" only lasted 6 episodes. The extras here are pretty good considering the short run of the show.  We do get an intelligent commentary track from writer/producer Frank Spotnitz, Daniel Sackheim and Michelle Maxwell MacLaren on the pilot discussing both the triumphs and failings of his new series as well as how he would have resolved the story arc that was designed to last at least a season regarding the murder of Kolchak's wife Irene. We also get a second commentary track with Spotnitz and Sackheim joined by co-producer John Kousakis  ""The Sea"" the second on a two part episode (the second episode didn't air on network TV but did air on the Sci-Fi Channel).  Spotnitz provided commentaries for some of ""The X-Files"" episodes he wrote so he's a pro here providing a wealth of information about the creation of the show and its brief development. Spotnitz and his co-producer also appear on ""The Sea-Part 2"" providing information about that episode.You can also print two scripts commissioned for the show but that weren't produced due to the cancellation of the show via the Interactual player. The Interactual software is included on the second disc. The first is ""Ascendant written by Melissa Blake & Joy Beth Blake and the second written by Emmy Award winner Darin Morgan (""The X-Files"" episodes ""Jose Chung's `From Outer Space'"" and ""The Final Repose of Clyde Bruckman"" among many others). While it's not the same as having the final two episodes produced, it does allow fans of the series to continue to delve into the Kolchak's world.""A Conversation with Frank Spotnitz"" provides the background on the creation of the series and Spotnitz's approach with the material. While a big fan of the original TV movies and the TV shows Spotnitz also recognized that the original series could never work today. In tone the show is closer to the original TV movies and ""Millennium"" as well as ""The X-Files"". Spotnitz also discusses the reasons for the change in location for the series as well his choice to use high definition video cameras to shoot the show vs. film. Spotnitz discusses the resolution of the show much more in the commentary tracks but he also points out that although Kolchak didn't kill his wife he was born evil which makes him the perfect anti-hero for the story. At the conclusion of the interview we get a brief snippet of an outtake.  We get deleted scenes for three episodes ""The Pilot"", ""Three"" and ""Into the Night"".While ""Night Stalker"" didn't get the love it deserved and went passed into the world of cancelled shows that just didn't get a chance, we can still enjoy it on DVD. Touchstone has done a marvelous job of presenting the show including commentary tracks, a featurette, two scripts in DVD-ROM format that can be printed out and deleted scenes.",3,"3 1/2 stars for

Some of the blame, of course, has to be placed on the stations. They seem to be more interested in quick, cheap fixes (eg reality shows ad nauseum) and don't give the good stuff a chance. No wonder I tend to read at night.",5,WHAT A LOSS..,1149033600,"05 31, 2006",2006,760,"['Okay', ""'ve"", 'just', 'watched', 'discs', 'shows', 'therein', 'couple', 'days', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'show', 'getting', 'better.However', 'have', 'concede', 'quite', 'possibly', 'big', 'mistake', 'show', 'made', 'was', 'calling', 'remake', 'Night', 'Stalker', '.Doing', 'thing', 'places', 'built', 'expectations', 'show', 'original', 'Kolchak-The', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'almost', 'iconic.Maybe', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'stand', 'alone', 'given', 'title', 'might', 'still', 'be', 'today.Good', 'scripts', 'good', 'cast', 'interesting', 'blame', 'course', 'be', 'placed', 'stations', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'interested', 'quick', 'cheap', 'fixes', 'eg', 'reality', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'good', 'stuff', 'chance', 'wonder', 'tend', 'read', 'night']",Night Stalker - The Complete Series

Stuart Townsend was Great, as was Gabrielle Union.  I was so upset at the network when the show was cancelled.  If they were going to cancel it- so be it, but to yank it off the air in the middle of a two parter was just mean.  They never did show the conclusion.  I could not believe it, I kept it on my Tivo for months hoping they would run the conclusion to a very compelling story.  Now I can buy it and finally see how the story arc ends",4,Terrific show -Bad Network,1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,542,"['never', 'really', 'watched', 'original', 'was', 'addicted', 'very', 'intense', 'remake', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'was', 'Great', 'was', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'was', 'so', 'upset', 'network', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'were', 'going', 'cancel', 'it-', 'so', 'be', 'yank', 'off', 'air', 'middle', 'two', 'parter', 'was', 'just', 'mean', 'never', 'did', 'show', 'conclusion', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'kept', 'Tivo', 'months', 'hoping', 'would', 'run', 'conclusion', 'very', 'compelling', 'story', 'Now', 'can', 'buy', 'finally', 'see', 'how', 'story', 'arc', 'ends']",Night Stalker - The Complete Series
