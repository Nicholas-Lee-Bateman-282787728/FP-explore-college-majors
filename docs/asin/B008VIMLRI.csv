1576642,A103KNDW8GN92L,B008VIMLRI,David Hugaert,"[2, 2]","In ""Diff'rent Strokes - The Complete Fourth Season"", the original cast returns, including Dody Goodman returning as the charming & eccentric Aunt Sophia. The serious subject matter blends in quite well with the comedy in episodes such as ""Health Club"", where Willis & Arnold are denied entry into Mr. Drummond's exclusive club, & in the episode titled ""Crime Story"" - a two-parter with Arnold & Dudley being bullied by two schoolyard thugs in giving up their school lunches. Willis escorts girlfriend Charlene in Mr. D's limousine in ""The Car"" & Arnold fears for Mr. D's safety in the episode ""Dreams"". Willis acquires a service station job in ""Lifesavers"", & Drummond learns he has a son whom he never met in ""Hello Daddy"". This fourth season is worth watching, where the viewer can learn many a life lesson through successive viewings while picking up many a laugh all the while. After all, in spite of the serious subject matter contained herein, this is still a sitcom the entire family can view together. Make this season of ""Diff'rent Strokes"" a must-have on your priority shopping list ASAP!R.I.P., Conrad Bain, Gary Coleman, Dana Plato, Nedra Volz & Dody Goodman.",5,The laughs continue in this stellar fourth season of the hit sitcom,1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,1171,"[""Diff'rent"", 'Strokes', 'Complete', 'Fourth', 'Season', 'original', 'cast', 'returns', 'including', 'Dody', 'Goodman', 'returning', 'charming', 'eccentric', 'Aunt', 'Sophia', 'serious', 'subject', 'matter', 'blends', 'quite', 'well', 'comedy', 'episodes', 'such', 'Health', 'Club', 'where', 'Willis', 'Arnold', 'are', 'denied', 'entry', 'Mr.', 'Drummond', 'exclusive', 'club', 'episode', 'titled', 'Crime', 'Story', 'two-parter', 'Arnold', 'Dudley', 'being', 'bullied', 'two', 'schoolyard', 'thugs', 'giving', 'up', 'school', 'lunches', 'Willis', 'girlfriend', 'Charlene', 'Mr.', 'D', 'limousine', 'Car', 'Arnold', 'Mr.', 'D', 'safety', 'episode', 'Dreams', 'Willis', 'service', 'station', 'job', 'Lifesavers', 'Drummond', 'son', 'whom', 'never', 'met', 'Hello', 'Daddy', 'fourth', 'season', 'worth', 'watching', 'where', 'viewer', 'can', 'learn', 'many', 'life', 'lesson', 'successive', 'viewings', 'picking', 'up', 'many', 'laugh', 'while', 'spite', 'serious', 'subject', 'matter', 'contained', 'herein', 'still', 'sitcom', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'view', 'together', 'Make', 'season', ""Diff'rent"", 'Strokes', 'must-have', 'priority', 'shopping', 'list', 'ASAP', 'R.I.P.', 'Conrad', 'Bain', 'Gary', 'Coleman', 'Dana', 'Plato', 'Nedra', 'Volz', 'Dody', 'Goodman']",Diff'rent Strokes: Season 4
