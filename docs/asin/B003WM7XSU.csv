This is a road movie of an artist as he travels thru the process of creating his latest ""work'. Yes, the journey takes him back to his childhood home and his school, but all of this influenced where he is at in his life at this time. He discusses his opinions on many things, and some of them are agreeable to most and some are not, but still this is what he is thinking and feeling as he writes his album. All of this is accompanied by surreal imagery and creepy settings which inspire him in his creative process. In the end, the album is complete, but the journey to discover continues-get it? If you are a fan of Steven Wilson, I think you will.If you are looking for a behind the scenes look at the technical making of an album, this is not it. If you are looking for a concert film, this is not it. If you are looking to find out what makes an artist tick-this is it!Side note: This is expertly crafted and a treat to watch. Disc 2 has a multitude to offer to those that are fans of S. Wilson's music with rare tracks and even rarer performance art of Bass Communion and Pig. The film was caringly crafted as was the artwork/menus/cases. Mine came in a gorgeous digibook with the discs housed in the covers.

Lalla ""DL""","[2, 2]","The DVD companion to this amazing album is a thoughtful discussion of music, the industry, SW's obsession with destroying iPods (and why) intermixed with scenes from the brilliant video to Harmony Korine and the artwork on various Steven Wilson projects. Couples with Lasse Hoile's beautiful cinematography and I just sat and absorbed it all. A true artist and musician. A great experience and highly recommended.",5,Interesting with achingly beautiful cinematography,1298419200,"02 23, 2011",2011,413,"['DVD', 'companion', 'amazing', 'album', 'thoughtful', 'discussion', 'music', 'industry', 'SW', 'obsession', 'destroying', 'iPods', 'why', 'intermixed', 'scenes', 'brilliant', 'video', 'Harmony', 'Korine', 'artwork', 'various', 'Steven', 'Wilson', 'projects', 'Couples', 'Lasse', 'Hoile', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'just', 'sat', 'absorbed', 'true', 'artist', 'musician', 'great', 'experience', 'highly', 'recommended']",Insurgentes
1369628,A3RA4G66RUJUWS,B003WM7XSU,Gis A. Bun,"[13, 15]","Not really surprising but a very odd 76 minute film on the first disc. The film, directed by Lasse Hoile [who's done just about every video, concert film and photography from Porcupine Tree and Wilson this past decade], jumps all over their place. Some portions show bleak scenes [which is typical of Hoile's work] - sort of wastelands.He goes back to his old high school, a grave in Mexico, chatting with other musicians, to Israel, to Japan, and to other locations. In between them you have Wilson talking about his three things he hates in current music: lack of quality in music and/or album artwork, his really hatefulness to iPods and MP3 players [you'll see him shooting, smashing, driving over and burning them] and how he hates the music used by them [but he still sells MP3s on his band's website]. He also talks about how fans complain when albums are too short - they expect 70+ minutes to an album and objects to negative reviews.This was described as a ""making of"" documentary but it really isn't.The second disc has 6 unreleased tracks from the Insurgentes sessions, excerpts from Bass Communion/Pig [another Wilson side project] live in Mexico [unsure why included except it was recording during the same period], Q&A; session after the Denmark film festival premiere and an alternative ending [a bit strange for a documentary].",3,"Not really a ""making of""",1288483200,"10 31, 2010",2010,1344,"['Not', 'really', 'surprising', 'very', 'odd', '76', 'minute', 'film', 'first', 'disc', 'film', 'directed', 'Lasse', 'Hoile', '[', 'who', 'done', 'just', 'video', 'concert', 'film', 'photography', 'Porcupine', 'Tree', 'Wilson', 'past', 'decade', ']', 'place', 'portions', 'show', 'bleak', 'scenes', '[', 'typical', 'Hoile', 'work', ']', 'sort', 'wastelands.He', 'back', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'grave', 'Mexico', 'chatting', 'other', 'musicians', 'Israel', 'Japan', 'other', 'locations', 'have', 'Wilson', 'talking', 'three', 'things', 'current', 'music', 'lack', 'quality', 'music', 'and/or', 'album', 'artwork', 'really', 'hatefulness', 'iPods', 'MP3', 'players', '[', ""'ll"", 'see', 'shooting', 'smashing', 'driving', 'burning', ']', 'how', 'music', 'used', '[', 'still', 'MP3s', 'band', 'website', ']', 'also', 'how', 'fans', 'complain', 'when', 'albums', 'are', 'too', 'short', 'expect', '70+', 'minutes', 'album', 'objects', 'negative', 'reviews.This', 'was', 'described', 'making', 'documentary', 'really', ""isn't.The"", 'second', 'disc', '6', 'unreleased', 'tracks', 'Insurgentes', 'sessions', 'excerpts', 'Bass', 'Communion/Pig', '[', 'Wilson', 'side', 'project', ']', 'live', 'Mexico', '[', 'unsure', 'why', 'included', 'was', 'recording', 'same', 'period', ']', 'Q', 'A', 'session', 'Denmark', 'film', 'festival', 'premiere', 'alternative', 'ending', '[', 'bit', 'strange', 'documentary', ']']",Insurgentes

It was a surprise (not sure how) from a great friend that owns an independent record store in my neighborhood.  He knew I was a giant fan of Steven Wilsons and pretty much devoured everything he put out. I tried to figure out what this was by the description, don't try - which only piqued my curiousity. To put it mildly, I floored.  This is a must for any fan of Wilsons, Porcupine Tree, or music in general.  It is oddly inspirational, so I definately recommend it to any musician that has trouble fitting-in in todays cookie cutter world.  I really feel like, now I finally know the man who is Steven Wilson, and that alone is worth a million dollars.  Maybe that's it, the inspirational part, I had elivated him to a godlike status and he turns out to be just like me or you.  Funny how a film full of coffins and bleak landscapes can bring so much sunshine into ones life.  GET IT!
