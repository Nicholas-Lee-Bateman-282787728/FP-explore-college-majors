496294,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00000F0EE,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[10, 11]","I love a good war movie, but there's something extra special about a war movie filmed while the fight is ongoing - especially when it recounts the story of a major victory that has been largely forgotten by history.  America's initial offensive thrust into Japanese-occupied territory took place at Makin Island (Butaritari atoll), and Gung Ho! is the story of that mission as carried out by the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion (Carlson's Raiders).  The strategic importance of the mission is now a matter of some debate, but at the time it was seen as an important diversion intended to disrupt Japanese communications and draw some of their forces away from more important targets (particularly Guadalcanal and Tulagi).  There was no attempt to actually occupy the island - this was a quick, decisive raid designed to take out every Japanese installation (especially the radio tower) and kill every Japanese soldier on the island - get in quick, get out quick, and leave nothing but destruction behind you.The Makin Island operation provided an important boost to morale back home, and this film obviously was made to further bolster domestic support for the war.  As a propaganda film (and I must say I hate calling any film that passionately espouses the causes of liberty and freedom propaganda), it's a real winner: we lost some boys on that island, but the mission was a complete success, and the patriotic speech at the very end puts a great big morale-boosting bow on the whole package.  As history, the film doesn't hold much water.  Not to take away from the bravery of Carlson's Raiders (which included FDR's son), but the whole mission was basically a mess.  Just about everything that could go wrong did go wrong - but you won't hear any of this in the film: more elaborate plans had to be altered due to choppy seas and heavy rains (one boat never got the new orders); the landing was chaotic to say the least; overestimating the size of the Japanese forces on the island, Carlson chose to withdraw that evening but could not get his men back to the subs due to the inclement weather, which in turn led him to actually surrender during the night - until, that is, he finally learned that his men had all but wiped out Japanese resistance already; and nine men were unknowingly left behind (and eventually beheaded by the Japanese).  Some of his men later questioned his leadership abilities.Obviously, the true story of Carlson's Raiders would not make for a good movie, especially during war-time.  As a morale booster and as entertainment, however, Gung Ho! is highly successful.  It follows the volunteer recruits who made the cut all the way from their rigorous, unorthodox training to their overseas journey tucked inside two submarines (this was the only landing via submarine during the entire war) - pausing to take in the remains of the attack on Pearl Harbor on the way - to their landing and fierce combat on Makin Island.  The acting is quite good from top to bottom and includes such well-known actors as Randolph Scott, Noah Beery, Jr., and a young Robert Mitchum (who is one fellow I would certainly want in my army).  I was a little disappointed in the actual combat scenes, though - after hearing about all of this unconventional training for the mission (Carlson taught his men how to fight dirty, knowing full well that the Japanese would fight dirty at every turn), the actual fighting turned out to be fairly conventional for the most part (but the hand-to-hand combat does portray the viciousness of the fighting pretty effectively).Gung Ho! is a notable wartime film from 1943, but it turns out that the true story of Carlson's Raiders and Carlson himself is much more interesting than Hollywood's version of the August 1942 raid on Makin Island.  Carlson is a fascinating man, having fought in several foreign armies (including a stint with the Chinese Communist Army) before America entered World War II.  His Gung Ho! battle cry reflected his training philosophy of ethical indoctrination; to him, every soldier was equal and was to be treated as an equal, for only then could the necessary sense of community make his men the most effective fighting force possible.  He was quite a maverick in the military, in both tactics (drawing heavily upon Mao-ist guerilla warfare) and political philosophy (insofar as he leaned noticeably toward Communism).",4,An inspiring but less than accurate look at Carlson's Raiders,1150156800,"06 13, 2006",2006,4386,"['love', 'good', 'war', 'movie', 'something', 'extra', 'special', 'war', 'movie', 'filmed', 'fight', 'ongoing', 'especially', 'when', 'story', 'major', 'victory', 'been', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'history', 'America', 'initial', 'offensive', 'thrust', 'Japanese-occupied', 'territory', 'took', 'place', 'Makin', 'Island', 'Butaritari', 'atoll', 'Gung', 'Ho', 'story', 'mission', 'carried', '2nd', 'Marine', 'Raider', 'Battalion', 'Carlson', 'Raiders', 'strategic', 'importance', 'mission', 'now', 'matter', 'debate', 'time', 'was', 'seen', 'important', 'diversion', 'intended', 'disrupt', 'Japanese', 'communications', 'draw', 'forces', 'away', 'more', 'important', 'targets', 'particularly', 'Guadalcanal', 'Tulagi', 'was', 'attempt', 'actually', 'occupy', 'island', 'was', 'quick', 'decisive', 'raid', 'designed', 'take', 'out', 'Japanese', 'installation', 'especially', 'radio', 'tower', 'kill', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'island', 'get', 'quick', 'get', 'out', 'quick', 'leave', 'nothing', 'destruction', 'you.The', 'Makin', 'Island', 'operation', 'provided', 'important', 'boost', 'morale', 'back', 'home', 'film', 'obviously', 'was', 'made', 'further', 'bolster', 'domestic', 'support', 'war', 'propaganda', 'film', 'must', 'say', 'hate', 'calling', 'film', 'passionately', 'causes', 'liberty', 'freedom', 'propaganda', 'real', 'winner', 'lost', 'boys', 'island', 'mission', 'was', 'complete', 'success', 'patriotic', 'speech', 'very', 'end', 'great', 'big', 'morale-boosting', 'bow', 'whole', 'package', 'history', 'film', ""n't"", 'hold', 'much', 'water', 'Not', 'take', 'away', 'bravery', 'Carlson', 'Raiders', 'included', 'FDR', 'son', 'whole', 'mission', 'was', 'basically', 'mess', 'Just', 'everything', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'did', 'go', 'wrong', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hear', 'film', 'more', 'elaborate', 'plans', 'had', 'be', 'altered', 'due', 'choppy', 'seas', 'heavy', 'rains', 'one', 'boat', 'never', 'got', 'new', 'orders', 'landing', 'was', 'chaotic', 'say', 'least', 'overestimating', 'size', 'Japanese', 'forces', 'island', 'Carlson', 'chose', 'withdraw', 'evening', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'men', 'back', 'subs', 'due', 'inclement', 'weather', 'turn', 'led', 'actually', 'surrender', 'night', 'finally', 'learned', 'men', 'had', 'wiped', 'out', 'Japanese', 'resistance', 'already', 'nine', 'men', 'were', 'unknowingly', 'left', 'behind', 'eventually', 'beheaded', 'Japanese', 'men', 'later', 'questioned', 'leadership', 'abilities.Obviously', 'true', 'story', 'Carlson', 'Raiders', 'would', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'especially', 'war-time', 'morale', 'booster', 'entertainment', 'however', 'Gung', 'Ho', 'highly', 'successful', 'volunteer', 'recruits', 'who', 'made', 'cut', 'way', 'rigorous', 'unorthodox', 'training', 'overseas', 'journey', 'tucked', 'two', 'submarines', 'was', 'only', 'landing', 'submarine', 'entire', 'war', 'pausing', 'take', 'remains', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'way', 'landing', 'fierce', 'combat', 'Makin', 'Island', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'top', 'bottom', 'such', 'well-known', 'actors', 'Randolph', 'Scott', 'Noah', 'Beery', 'Jr.', 'young', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'who', 'one', 'fellow', 'would', 'certainly', 'want', 'army', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'actual', 'combat', 'scenes', 'hearing', 'unconventional', 'training', 'mission', 'Carlson', 'taught', 'men', 'how', 'fight', 'dirty', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'Japanese', 'would', 'fight', 'dirty', 'turn', 'actual', 'fighting', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'fairly', 'conventional', 'most', 'part', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'portray', 'viciousness', 'fighting', 'pretty', 'effectively', '.Gung', 'Ho', 'notable', 'wartime', 'film', '1943', 'out', 'true', 'story', 'Carlson', 'Raiders', 'Carlson', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'August', '1942', 'raid', 'Makin', 'Island', 'Carlson', 'fascinating', 'man', 'having', 'fought', 'several', 'foreign', 'armies', 'including', 'stint', 'Chinese', 'Communist', 'Army', 'America', 'entered', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Gung', 'Ho', 'battle', 'cry', 'reflected', 'training', 'philosophy', 'ethical', 'indoctrination', 'soldier', 'was', 'equal', 'was', 'be', 'treated', 'equal', 'only', 'then', 'could', 'necessary', 'sense', 'community', 'make', 'men', 'most', 'effective', 'fighting', 'force', 'possible', 'was', 'quite', 'maverick', 'military', 'tactics', 'drawing', 'heavily', 'Mao-ist', 'guerilla', 'warfare', 'political', 'philosophy', 'insofar', 'leaned', 'noticeably', 'Communism']",N/A

It was made at a time when two awesome ruthless enemies had half the world in their grip. Both seemed unstoppable. It truly was a WORLD war. Based on the small but effective baby steps attack on Makin island. At the time people needed a light to penetrate the darkness that crowded hope. Remember Roosevelt's famous line ""We have nothing to fear but fear itself"". The president, saying this on national radio, zero's in on what was corroding people's minds at the time. It is not something said when there are giant rousing victories occuring, but when despair is lurking. This film was like a shot of hope.

I wanted to avoid returning a film because of poor quality. previous reviews for this film expressed the same frustration over the comingling on the Amazon reviews for this film, yet there was no change implemented. Well my concerns were justified because this vendor and film had unacceptable sound quality whereby I had to turn my Sony Surround Sound up so high to hear the film that it caused a hum in my speakers. The sight part of the film was better than the sound. Since the sound was unacceptable, I returned it to Amazon.My second choice was Gung Ho! The Movie; WW2 The attack of Makan Island by USMC Marines 1942 old films DVD by Campbell Films. This version was overwhelmingly superior to the previous film version. The sound track ran at regular levels on my Sony Surround Sound with no hum! Campbell Films Created a new jacket for the DVD based on live footage. They digitized the original footage and included actual footage from the returning heroes on their submarines as they docked. In addition, Campbell Films included (2) two other DVDs which included Newsreel Footage from the period as well as ""Victory at Sea"" DVD.

This raid was done in the same spirit of Doolittle's Raid on Tokyo: a message to Hirohito that we could also hit them, and hit them hard.  (He obviously did NOT get the message.)  This movie is definitely a product of its time, as shown by the valor of our side and the uncaring feeling of the enemy.  While this was true to some extent, it is definitely hyped in the movie.  Again, you have to take into account the feelings of the time.  I recall discussing the propaganda cartoons of this era with a much younger co-worker in one job I had, and she was complaining about the stereotypical portrayal of the enemy.  I told her that they were doing to same for us, and that these cartoons merely reflected the feelings of that time.Despite this, I still love this movie and the characters in it.  It definitely portrays both sides of the coin: the bravery and valor, and the fact that not everyone made it back.  It's a well done film, and maybe I was lucky, cause I got a good copy.

It tells the story of the Second Marine Raider Battalion from its formation shortly after the Pearl Harbor to its first mission, a raid on Makin Island.  The battalion is a volunteer outfit, so the first question the movie asks of its young stars is ""Why do you want to kill Japs?""  The Kentucky hick and the Brooklyn toughie and the ordained minister all pretty much say the same thing - because I don't like them.The film follows the recruits through training and graduation to deployment and finally battle, with a short detour for a sloppy little romantic subplot.  GUNG HO!, released in 1943, is based on actual events.  The Marines' successful raid was big news back in those bleak days.This is more a curiosity, a study of the value of propaganda on public morale, than a historically accurate document.  Some of its inconsistencies are pretty jarring, though.  For instance, Colonel Thorwald (Randolph Scott), the commander of the battalion, gives an inspirational speech at the beginning of training.  He exhorts his men to ""Cast out all prejudices, racial and religious,"" and learn to act as a, well, band of brothers.  The men may have taken it to heart, but you can't help but notice there are NO people of color, save for a Filipino volunteer, in the unit.  The only African-American in the whole movie is a cook on the transport submarine.  It probably wasn't noticed when the movie was released, but it does seem a little ironic now.Col. Thorwald delivers a few more ""Some of us are going to die for democracy and freedom and equality"" speeches, which are set in stark contrast with the behavior of the Japanese defenders.  Fighter pilots laugh as they strafe ground troops.  A badly wounded GI, begging for water, is brutally bayoneted by a Japanese soldier.If you like standard issue war movies, I guess you'll like GUNG HO!  Be warned, though.  On the cover of the dvd case it looks like Robert Mitchum is pictured next to Randolph Scott, and it seems like they're co-starring.  Mitchum has a relatively minor role in this one, much smaller than those played by the likes of Alan Curtis and Noah Beery, Jr.And the dvd appears to have been transfers from a handy print.
