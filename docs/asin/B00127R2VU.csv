1135362,A130YN8T37O833,B00127R2VU,"Always Samsung ""ravereviews""","[5, 6]","I have been waiting 4 this series 2 get DUBBED for a few years now. As soon as i saw CLAMP attached to this i knew it was going to be amazing. CLAMP always churns out the HITS. These characters were also apart of the Tsubasa world and vice versa. Makona from Magic Knight Rayearth is also in this series as well. I'm glad to see that it's finally released in the states and can't wait to finish season 1. The male voice characters dubbing was a bit annoying at 1st when he yells but just let it settle in after the 1st episode and you will find that his yelling is part of the allure and actually gives Watanuki more character besides it helps to add to the comedic atmosphere. I'm already beyond addicted as i saw the movie before the series and hope that season 2 makes it state side as well. Of course this and Tsubasa are on 2 different levels. One series is about people with magical mutant like powers and this one isn't so much so. The story is about a boy name Watanuki who sees spirits in his everyday life, spirits that haunt and torture him but he doesn't know why and nobody else can see them but him. One day on his way home he passes by a shop that grants wishes and by some force of nature he is pulled into the shop not willingly but by some magical force. He meets Yuko and she offers to grant him a wish but she only grants it if he submits payment and payment is that he becomes her employee does housekeeping choirs etc. In each episode there is someone who has a wish that needs to be granted and it only gets interesting. Hopefully more will be explained soon. But i heard CLAMP wasn't impressed with this series so season 3 might not be happening. As for Tsubasa we all know the production company messed that series up and CLAMP decided to pull the plug so we might not even see season 2 here in the US. Great series overall, i just wish the soundtrack for xxxHolic pronounced simply HOLIC with all the X's ignored was produced by Yuki Kajiura who always does a splendid job with her Japanese techno opera.",5,GREAT SERIES!!!!!,1207267200,"04 4, 2008",2008,2030,"['have', 'been', 'waiting', '4', 'series', '2', 'get', 'DUBBED', 'few', 'years', 'now', 'As', 'soon', 'i', 'saw', 'CLAMP', 'attached', 'i', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'amazing', 'CLAMP', 'always', 'out', 'HITS', 'characters', 'were', 'also', 'apart', 'Tsubasa', 'world', 'vice', 'versa', 'Makona', 'Magic', 'Knight', 'Rayearth', 'also', 'series', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'finally', 'released', 'states', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'finish', 'season', '1', 'male', 'voice', 'characters', 'dubbing', 'was', 'bit', 'annoying', '1st', 'when', 'just', 'let', 'settle', '1st', 'episode', 'will', 'find', 'yelling', 'part', 'allure', 'actually', 'Watanuki', 'more', 'character', 'add', 'comedic', 'atmosphere', ""'m"", 'already', 'addicted', 'i', 'saw', 'movie', 'series', 'hope', 'season', '2', 'state', 'side', 'as', 'well', 'course', 'Tsubasa', 'are', '2', 'different', 'levels', 'One', 'series', 'people', 'magical', 'mutant', 'powers', 'one', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'story', 'boy', 'name', 'Watanuki', 'who', 'spirits', 'everyday', 'life', 'haunt', 'torture', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'nobody', 'else', 'can', 'see', 'One', 'day', 'way', 'home', 'shop', 'wishes', 'force', 'nature', 'pulled', 'shop', 'not', 'willingly', 'magical', 'force', 'grant', 'wish', 'only', 'payment', 'payment', 'employee', 'housekeeping', 'choirs', 'etc', 'episode', 'someone', 'who', 'wish', 'be', 'granted', 'only', 'interesting', 'Hopefully', 'more', 'will', 'be', 'explained', 'soon', 'i', 'heard', 'CLAMP', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'series', 'so', 'season', '3', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'happening', 'Tsubasa', 'know', 'production', 'company', 'messed', 'series', 'up', 'CLAMP', 'decided', 'pull', 'plug', 'might', 'not', 'even', 'see', 'season', '2', 'here', 'US', 'Great', 'series', 'overall', 'i', 'just', 'wish', 'soundtrack', 'xxxHolic', 'pronounced', 'simply', 'HOLIC', 'X', 'ignored', 'was', 'produced', 'Yuki', 'Kajiura', 'who', 'always', 'splendid', 'job', 'Japanese', 'techno', 'opera']",xxxHOLiC: First Collection

He stumbles upon the shop the mistress of which is in the business of granting wishes - for a price. She teaches him how to use his ability, and makes him work for her - mainly by cooking, which seems to annoy Watanuki more than anything else. Many things annoy Watanuki, did I mention that? He pretty much behaves like a 3 year old most of the time, even in front of a girl he likes and in front of a boy who is definitely his superior in terms of the ability to stay calm in a crisis. Still, I guess that makes for a more realistic hero... or antihero. This is basically a collection of several episodes of anime, each about 20 minutes in length. Total running length was about 1 hr 45 minutes. Extras include theme songs to the show, images from the show, and a few trailers to other movies - generally extras were very unimpressive.I enjoyed this, but I cannot say that I have any desire to watch it again. The main entertainment value of this anime, I think, is in the fact that it is psychologically more complex than most. The relationship between Watanuki and shop owner is maternal and mentorly, various clients stumble into the shop whom Watanuki tries to help because he sees them tormented by spirits that haunt his own soul, and there appears to be some character developing occurring. Presumably there are more collections coming our way - I may check them out.",3,"Entertaining, but forgettable",1207180800,"04 3, 2008",2008,1485,"['Watanuki', 'normal', 'more', 'annoying', 'most', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'one', 'abnormal', 'ability', 'seeing', 'spirits', 'shop', 'mistress', 'business', 'granting', 'wishes', 'price', 'how', 'use', 'ability', 'work', 'mainly', 'cooking', 'annoy', 'Watanuki', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'Many', 'things', 'annoy', 'Watanuki', 'did', 'mention', 'pretty', 'much', 'behaves', '3', 'year', 'old', 'most', 'time', 'even', 'front', 'girl', 'front', 'boy', 'who', 'definitely', 'superior', 'terms', 'ability', 'stay', 'calm', 'crisis', 'Still', 'guess', 'more', 'realistic', 'hero', 'antihero', 'basically', 'collection', 'several', 'episodes', 'anime', '20', 'minutes', 'length', 'Total', 'running', 'length', 'was', '1', 'hr', '45', 'minutes', 'Extras', 'include', 'theme', 'songs', 'show', 'images', 'show', 'few', 'trailers', 'other', 'movies', 'generally', 'extras', 'were', 'very', 'unimpressive.I', 'enjoyed', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'have', 'desire', 'watch', 'again', 'main', 'entertainment', 'value', 'anime', 'think', 'fact', 'psychologically', 'more', 'complex', 'most', 'relationship', 'Watanuki', 'shop', 'owner', 'maternal', 'mentorly', 'various', 'clients', 'stumble', 'shop', 'whom', 'Watanuki', 'help', 'tormented', 'spirits', 'haunt', 'own', 'soul', 'there', 'be', 'character', 'developing', 'occurring', 'Presumably', 'are', 'more', 'collections', 'coming', 'way', 'may', 'check', 'out']",xxxHOLiC: First Collection

Believe me, the story's headed straight into the abyss of pain and sacrifice that normally accompanies Clamp work and with its overlap with Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles (TRC).  There's bound to be some heartbreak. Well... not just some, bucketloads!However, the artwork is pretty and mature and artsy for Clamp.  Definitely a delineated difference from their mainstream work such as TRC, Clamp Detectives and even Tokyo Babylon from back in the day.  Everything's a bit surreal and it's done on purpose.  But the hallmark of this series is the writing.  Whoever's translating these pieces is doing a phenomenal job.  The story's all encompassing... humorous, serious, thought-provoking, and morally infused without the overwrought preachiness of Clamp's past works.Loveliness incarnate and just how anime should be.  Fun, ferocious but fantastically deep.One word of warning... it does get depressingly dark fairly quick and I wouldn't recommend it for children under 13.  Also, on that note, if your child is hooked on TRC... that series goes into places of heartache that you may be careful with even letting your younger, more immature pre-adolescents watch.  Also, remember that all of these series deal with issues that you should constantly talk about with your children and make certain that they are dealing, understanding and processing the information in a positively reinforced way.  These stories can acerbate children's issues if they aren't talking about them with someone.",4,Unique...

However, there is a thin line between holding the viewer's attention and doing back work.I just cannot get excited enough about this series after watching the first collection to watch any of the follow ons. The art is interesting in the overly tall, thin caricatures of people (almost like walking stick figures). The personal interactions of the main characters is almost stereotypical in the adolescent and more mature woman formula with its oedipal implications. Add to that the excessive use of cartoonish emotional outbursts by the male lead (Watanuki), and this is just a little over the top for me. While the female lead (Yuko) is drawn with a little more curve than the rest this is no fan service series either.

But the story's much more in-depth than that, and CLAMP rarely disappoints.Basically, the tale begins with Kimihiro Watanuki, a high school student who has this extraordinary affliction:  not only can he see spirits and monsters, but they have an unnatural attraction to him.  While attempting getting away from an intense, supernatural mass, Watanuki finds himself in front of a mysterious shop.Lured inside, he meets up with Yuko Ichihara, the Time-Space Witch, who discovers Watanuki's malady.  She offers curing Watanuki of his problem, but for a price:  he ends up working for her, and in return he gets embroiled with a lot of mysterious situations due to other customers and their problems.Not all the stories end on a happy note, but Watanuki somehow gets a little wiser through his experiences, especially with the help of Domeki and his love interest, Himawari Kunogi.The First Collection sets up the story on how Watanuki meets up with Yuko and how it affects his life and the people around them.  The stories are interesting and shows how Yuko views life in the modern world while Watanuki goes from an emo high school student, to one understanding the strangeness about him.Though it does connect with CLAMP's other series, Tsubasa, xxxHolic is definitely a good show to view.

I had no knowledge of anything about this series going in and the 4 episodes I did watch were engaging, mysterious and funny. I think this first collection does a good job at whetting the appetite for the story to follow.  I do enjoy watching anime and there are some aspects of this that are very - anime - which some people might consider weird or annoying, but I don't think that anyone who has seen a lot of anime would think that the character actions or anything about it is weird.It has a feel of a dark comedy and the way everything was animated reminds me a lot of the Nightmare Before Christmas (not the same obviously, but the movements and creatures are dreadful and captivating all at once.)  In the first 4 episodes I did not notice anything overtly adult (be it sexuality or violence) however if anyone is offended by casual use of the occult (fortune telling, spirits, omens, Ouija boards) this is not the series for you.The DVD itself comes in a slim case - no additional papers or artwork and there aren't much in the way of dvd extras either.

My latest discovery is the first collection of xxxHolic. xxxHolic is about a young high school student named Watanuki. For all of his young life, Watanuki had to deal with demon spirits who would find a way to never let the young man have any peace in his life. It wasn't until he comes across a curio shop run by Yuko, a dimensional witch who grants wishes for a price, that those dark, demon spirits were vanquished from his life courtesy of Yuko. Of course there is always a price to pay. Watanuki involuntarily becomes a part time employee at Yuko's shop.What I liked about the series is the beautiful animation. The colors can be both vibrant and subtle. What I didn't like is how annoying some of the characters were. I also like how the characters were drawn, long and slender. Watanuki totally grates on my nerves. His whining and self-absorbtion made me hit the mute button on several times. Then there is Mokona, some bizarre rabbit like creature that is just as annoying as any Pokemon character. At first Mokona was cute but that thing quickly got on my nerves as much as Watanuki did. The writing wasn't terribly interesting. It left something to be desired or at least on the last two episodes on this dvd.xxxHolic isn't awful by all means but it is certainly flawed.

""xxxHOLiC: First Collection"" smoothly introduces the eccentric characters and main plotline of this series, and its story is filled with malevolent specters, magical rings, and lushly drawn animation.Watanuki can see spirits -- and as the story opens, he is chased and pummeled to the ground by a huge cloud of them. Naturally, this looks rather odd to other people.But those spirits magically vanish outside a strange house, and Watanuki is drawn inside against his will. The owner of this shop is Yuko, a strange woman who says she can grant wishes... at a price. She predict that Watanuki sees spirits and has been haunted by them all his life, and that his wish is that he would no longer be troubled by them.Before Watanuki is sure what's happening, Yuko has tricked him into working for her, as the price of his cure. Despite insisting that he won't work for her -- and seeing the terrible effect of spirits leaving him -- he ends up cooking and running errands for her anyway.In the process, he also sees what she does. A young woman receives a ring from Yuko to fix the stiffness spreading through her hand... but a bad habit is compounding her ailment, and it might kill her if she doesn't learn in time. And a discussion about fortunetellers ends with Yuko taking Watanuki to two of them -- and letting him see that telling the future can be dangerous.And a Ouija board (called an ""angel"" here) becomes deadly when Watanuki and a stoic classmate of his, Domeki, go to a school to find out what the smelly haunting is all about. But Watanuki doesn't realize what the truly dangerous influence at this school is -- and the only way of getting rid of it.For an introductory volume, ""xxxHOLiC: First Collection"" is a pretty solid story, and an easy introduction into the world of Yuko's shop. Biff, bang, it's done. In the course of about two scenes, Watanuki is immersed in the shop's business, and by the end of the first episode you know it's going to be a very long, strange trip ahead.CLAMP's artwork is smoothly transferred into a lush, detailed anime style, full of drooping embroidered robes, pipe smoke, and the misty backdrops of a spirit-infested world. There are a few scenes in the first episode that look painfully 2-D in their animation -- particularly when Watanuki is by himself -- but fortunately the animators hit their stride by the second.Similarly, the stories are a nice blend of mild horror and kooky comedy. On one hand, we have the ominous stories about evil spirits, the sins that corrupt our lives, the terrible wishes people make, and the futures we can choose. But at the same time we have the cuddly bouncing rabbity thing, and Watanuki constantly having his chain yanked by Yuko.Watanuki is a bit annoying, since he tends to ricochet up and down the emotional scale with the slightest reason. But he's likable in his quieter moments, and Yuko is an enjoyably eccentric, deeply mysterious female lead. And Domeki is a nice counterpoint to Watanuki's melodrama -- he's very stoic, quiet and mildly sarcastic. We don't see enough of that guy.""xxxHOLiC: First Collection"" introduces us to the world of wishes, bad habits and evil spirits, and promises to only get more interesting later on.

These are just some of the things you have to look forward to in xxxHolic (just pronounced 'Holic').The series revolves around Watanuki, the aforementioned annoying 19 year-old boy, who is plagued by visions of spirits and other-worldly occurrences. Out for a walk one day, Watanuki is drawn into Yuko's ""shop"". Yuko sells dreams and wishes... for a fee.  Watanuki would like to be rid of the spirits that accompany him, and winds up working for Yuko as payment.  Once he's worked off the payment, Yuko will grant his wish.  In the meantime, it seems that the two form a sort of a partnership; each using their gifts to help others.Holic is simultaneously creepy and funny, often changing moods with a simple pithy comment (usually delivered by Yuko).  I was quickly drawn into the watercolor world that Clamp has presented.Of course, Holic is not without its stereotypical elements... most of them being the characters themselves:Watanuki - the whiny, angst-ridden hero who takes to screaming when the mood suits himYuko - The mysterious, knowledgeable, and sexy older-woman who takes the hero under her wingMaru and Moro - The over zealous (and usually off-screen) girls who spout repetitive lines [ala Ed from Cowboy Bebop]Domeki - Watanuki's dead-pan counterpointHimawari - Watanuki's love interestMokona - the obligatory talking stuffed animalBut beyond the stereotypes are plots that weave in and out of reality, looping in the paranormal and occult.

I gather that the intent here was something like fill-in-the-blank-a-holic, meaning slave to one's desires whatever those desires might happen to be, but as it is, people will likely assume pornography.  Nothing could be further from the truth.Watanuki has been haunted by spirits his entire life.  It is not merely that he can ""see dead people"", but that spirits find him irresistibly attractive and ""go for him"", like iron filings to a magnet or mice to the Pied Piper.  A particularly bad attack dissipates right outside a VERY unusual shop, which Watanuki finds himself forced to enter.  There he meets the mysterious Yuko who fulfils dreams and grants wishes...for a fee.  Informed by Yuko that their meeting was destined, Watanuki finds himself buffaloed into working for Yuko as the price for granting his wish that he be freed from his ""curse"".  This begins a VERY strange ride.The ethical basis of this world is karma, ""what goes around, comes around"", or you get what you deserve.  Yuko has great powers that she could very easily abuse, but she doesn't want the karmic consequences of doing so.  Although she does everything for a price, it is a very carefully calculated price -- exactly equal in value to the service provided.  In this sort of business it would be particularly unwise to cheat a customer.  Thus though Watanuki is certain that he is being taken advantage of, we can be sure that Yuko sincerely intends to fairly compensate him as she makes use of his singular talent for seeing and attracting spirits, and that of his polar opposite and possible rival in romance, Domeki, who has a talent for repelling spirits.  Much of these first four episodes is taken up with introducing the cast and setting the stage for the future, but nevertheless we still get to see someone who honestly desires to be possessed, someone whose habitual dishonesty brings misfortune, a karmic warning about the dangers of Ouija boards, and a lesson in how to tell real fortune tellers from fakes.

1135374,AN81JUYW2SL24,B00127R2VU,Gearhead Mania,"[3, 6]","xxxHolic is a story about a young student, Watanuki, who has been born with a curse that allows him to see the evil spirits that constantly pursue him. Yuko reveals later on that the evil spirits see Watanuki as a ""delicious"" meal. The story is told through unusual but artistic animation. The first collection introduces the main characters along with Watanuki's love interest, Himawari, and companion Domeki.Essentially, Watanuki has to do housework and cook for Yuko to build up a ""credit line"" so that Yuko can grant Watanuki his wish of ridding the spirits forever since each wish comes with a price. After watching the first four episodes, I found the common theme of Watanuki and Yuko working together to improve the lives of ""customers"" as the story delves into more mystical matters. Mokina's character is essentially a small black rabbit-like critter that talks, similar to Pikachi from Pokemon. It provides a sense of comic relief for much of the disc.The voice acting is superb and is typical of English dubbed anime. My reaction to the animation quality is mixed. The characters are drawn fairly well, as you can clearly make out their expressions. However, in certain scenes the background crowd simply does not get colored in.The DVD jacket shows that it is rated TV-PG and I agree. While Yuko is drawn with extremely long legs and provocative attire, this is typical of many female anime characters. The dialogue and language is appropriate for small children. Some of the content involves supernatural forces and evil spirits, but they are drawn in a manner that makes them seem more comical than scary. The evil spirits are similar to Pokemon.Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with the story and will eagerly await the second collection!",4,"""What a cute stuffed animal!""",1207353600,"04 5, 2008",2008,1756,"['xxxHolic', 'story', 'young', 'student', 'Watanuki', 'who', 'been', 'born', 'curse', 'see', 'evil', 'spirits', 'constantly', 'Yuko', 'reveals', 'later', 'evil', 'spirits', 'see', 'Watanuki', 'delicious', 'meal', 'story', 'told', 'unusual', 'artistic', 'animation', 'first', 'collection', 'main', 'characters', 'Watanuki', 'love', 'interest', 'Himawari', 'companion', 'Domeki.Essentially', 'Watanuki', 'do', 'housework', 'cook', 'Yuko', 'build', 'up', 'credit', 'line', 'Yuko', 'can', 'grant', 'Watanuki', 'wish', 'ridding', 'spirits', 'forever', 'wish', 'price', 'watching', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'found', 'common', 'theme', 'Watanuki', 'Yuko', 'working', 'together', 'improve', 'lives', 'customers', 'story', 'more', 'mystical', 'matters', 'Mokina', 'character', 'essentially', 'small', 'black', 'rabbit-like', 'critter', 'talks', 'similar', 'Pikachi', 'Pokemon', 'sense', 'comic', 'relief', 'much', 'disc.The', 'voice', 'acting', 'superb', 'typical', 'English', 'dubbed', 'anime', 'reaction', 'animation', 'quality', 'mixed', 'characters', 'are', 'drawn', 'fairly', 'well', 'can', 'clearly', 'make', 'out', 'expressions', 'However', 'certain', 'scenes', 'background', 'crowd', 'simply', 'not', 'get', 'colored', 'in.The', 'DVD', 'jacket', 'rated', 'TV-PG', 'agree', 'Yuko', 'drawn', 'extremely', 'long', 'legs', 'provocative', 'attire', 'typical', 'many', 'female', 'anime', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'language', 'appropriate', 'small', 'children', 'content', 'supernatural', 'forces', 'evil', 'spirits', 'are', 'drawn', 'manner', 'seem', 'more', 'comical', 'scary', 'evil', 'spirits', 'are', 'similar', 'Pokemon.Overall', 'am', 'thoroughly', 'impressed', 'story', 'will', 'eagerly', 'await', 'second', 'collection']",xxxHOLiC: First Collection

Not a lot of pulse-pounding action here, not so much with the gratuitous violence, and the horror element is comparatively tame. But in its offbeat, sometimes silly, conversation-rife essence, xxxHOLiC just may possibly sneak up on a body.All his young life Kimihiro Watanuki has been harried by dark spirits no one else can see, this a curse born into his bloodline. One day, as he attempts to escape yet another mystical assault, Watanuki finds himself drawn to the walled residence of Yuko Ichihara. Yuko is a dimensional witch, a woman of enigmatic powers and with a hedonistic way about her. She owns a shop specializing in the granting of wishes, the price of which transactions might at times be as high as someone's soul. Yuko offers to rid Watanuki of his supernatural demons - but for a fee. As such Watanuki finds himself toiling away in Yuko's shop, what with running errands, handling domestic chores, and, every so often, assisting with Yuko's clientele. Of course, it's in this last area that Watanuki's weird curse comes in handiest.xxxHOLiC (simply pronounced ""holic""; with the ""xxx"" being silent) is based on the manga by the Clamp studio. This dvd, titled xxxHOLiC: First Collection, offers up the first 4 episodes of the series. I didn't know much about this series, so I didn't quite know what to make of the lead character Watanuki, who's a high school kid. He's not your conventional hero, neither brawny nor prone to muscular heroic actions. He's certainly not a cool cat, but more like an outcast. His physical frame is composed of awkward and gangly lines, and he's even been accused of looking like a drunken crab. Dude also tends to erupt in exasperating snits at the drop of a hat (I've never been a fan of the popping veins, the sudden fangs, and blush marks which crop up whenever anime characters ""humorously"" act up). If there's a classic hero role here, it's filled in by Watanuki's extraordinarily composed rival Shizuka Domeki, whom Watanuki extremely dislikes. Doesn't help, too, that, in the implied triangle involving Watanuki, Domeki, and their pretty classmate Himawari, Watanuki is never quite sure whether it's he or Domeki who's the third wheel.The ectoplasmic entities look properly menacing, seemingly mostly crafted out of some sinister smoky substance. And, sure, they do prey on humanity. But they're not inherently evil as much as hungry and attracted to certain humans. Certainly these supernatural things aren't bested by a pummeling into the ground or by a stabbing with a blade. There are no easy answers, in dealing with them. It's even suggested that these spirits are in some way empowered by human flaws. Some people voluntarily opt to be possessed (""The Inevitable""). And, sometimes, the onus of one's actions lingers and weighs heavily on the soul, as is the case with the compulsive liar (""Falsehood""). In ""Angel"" the residue of dark emotions left in the aftermath of a fortune-telling board game gives life to a poisonous manifestation. How do you beat these things? Sometimes, you don't.Themes of destiny and the inevitability of destiny are explored, paving the way for plenty of metaphysical chit-chat between Yuko and Watanuki, which then leads to Watanuki feeling even more aggravated (oh, those stupid veins). Meanwhile, the stories tend to be episodic and leisurely paced, lending a feeling that nothing is being accomplished in the show. The focus of the series is obviously Watanuki and his personal growth as he continues to work in Yuko's shop, but four episodes are really too few with regards to his evolution as a character. I did enjoy Yuko's constant teasing of him (loved the funny headphones bit).The graphics are interesting, but not to everyone's taste. The make or break factor seems to hinge on the way the characters are depicted. The filmmakers saw fit to animate them as tall, ridiculously long-limbed folks (but not as bluntly rendered as, say, Phantom 2040 or even MTV's Aeon Flux). This just adds visual energy to the already off-kiltered feel of the show. I liked it, after a while.All in all, these episodes made for a pleasant distraction.

In fact, there really isn't anything offensive about these episodes, aside from their weird paranormal subject matter.  xxxHolic is the intriguing story of an independent teenaged boy by the name of Kimihiro Watanuki.  Resembling a bespectacled Monkey D. Luffy, Watanuki is a lanky aspiring chef with a most troublesome affliction--he sees dead people...or, more accurately, he sees giant eyeballs trailed by long clouds of swirling purple smoke.  These kooky ""spirits"" pursue Watanuki relentlessly, harassing the gangly gourmet with such fervor that he's nearly driven out of his mind.  At last the tormented youth finds himself standing at the doorstep of the statuesque fortune teller, Yuko Ichihara--the chain-smoking curator of a so-called ""wish-granting shop.""  This mysterious Morticia Addams look-alike assures Watanuki that she can and will bust his ghosts...but only if he'll agree to cook lavish meals for her every day, and care for her bubbly bunny-rabbit friend, Mokana.xxxHolic has an unusual art style, with tall, freakishly slim characters and a muted color palate that enhances the spooky atmosphere.  The opening and closing themes are catchy, and the English voice acting is excellent.  Action fans should be forewarned: there are no giant robots or blazing machineguns in this anime.  Even so, I found it surprisingly captivating and I'd love to see more of this series.  This DVD contains only the first four episodes of the 24-part xxxHolic saga.  The extras are pretty skimpy, consisting merely of textless opening and closing songs and a brief image gallery.  If you likedWitch Hunter RobinorSpirited Away, you should give xxxHolic a try.

1135379,ACEA95FQS1AVP,B00127R2VU,Jem,"[7, 9]","Since I have read the manga that this anime is directly based on, I had some expectations going in.  The anime follows the manga quite closely.  It is about a boy, Watanuki Kimihiro, who is plagued with visions of ghosts and spirits. His own two feet drag him into the shop of Yuka, a mysterious witch, who promises to help. In return for her services, Watanuki ends up doing menial chores for her around the shop. This premise sounded like it could be cool, and as I am a huge fan of Clamp (I love Chobits!) I expected more.  This volume is more a random series of events wherin our boy helps the witch with some ""issues.""If you enjoyed the Manga, xxxHolic the Anime is sure to be pleasing as well. However, I found the manga to be much less objectionable than the Anime. The main character is annoying and he seems to be much more of a whimp than some of Clamp's other protagonists. Plus, Yuka can be a little bit ""touchy-feely"" with Watanuki.  This is kinda creepy.  Though he's supposed to be 19, his characterization is much younger (the ""boy"" description is on target), and she's a grown woman.  A little bit of a shota vibe that bothered me.The twins...they are waaaay over the top and beyond (way, way beyond) cute. I can put up with all of this to a degree, but not all at once, not all in one show. In a book, you can overlook the annoying factor, it's not literally screaming in your ear.  On screen...well that's a different matter.  The characters that are supposed to intersperse some humor just grate on the nerves.  I think this may appeal more to teen fans than adults.The art work is not some of Clamp's best, but it is still above and beyond some other production companies.  Overall, this anime is okay, but there are much better choices for spending my hard-earned money on.

Some reviewers have said that this series is about a boy who is plagued by contact with the spirit world, but unfortunately that's just the setup to introduce Watanuki to Yuko, who is a sort of Morticia Adams meets Yoda meets the master from Kung Fu or the Karate Kid.  She dispenses worldly wisdom from her ""wish shop"" in exchange for payment that isn't very clear up front, but in Watanuki's case consist of his watch and his part-time services as a chef and personal shopper (don't be surprised if you find yourself thinking ""wax on/wax off"" when you see Watanuki' attempts in the kitchen).  Watanuki yells and whines almost constantly (showing bizarrely shark-like teeth in the process), while Yuko smokes, calls for more sake, and slinks around in lingerie.  Throw in a Pok&eacute;mon-type one-eyed stuffed bunny thing that jumps up and down and demands food constantly, two annoying little girls, who don't do much other than shout, giggle and refer to Yuko as their mistress, a possible love interest and a rival for Watanuki, and you've got -- wacky wisdom!It's hard to say exactly who the intended audience for this program is.  My first thought on watching it was that it's very similar to the cartoons my preteen nieces and nephew watch on television.  Only those don't have a lead character that smokes and drinks sake to excess.  And the xxx in the title, though not pronounced, might lead one to believe this is anime for adults. But the messages in the episodes are definitely not for grown-ups -- we have only one past, there are many possible futures, you have to learn your own lessons, etc., so I'd say this DVD is best for teens who are kind of into goth and anime and haven't seen and heard all these new-age messages before.

The three x's are left to your imagination, but the idea is one of overindulgent compulsion of some sort or another. The first striking feature of this anime, is that unlike most others, it is very pleasant and easy to follow. There are only a few characters with very specific roles and it takes place in a typical Japanese suburb. It is about a high school boy named Watanuki and a good witch named Yuko that he comes upon in the first episode who becomes his friend and employer. Watanuki is plagued by troublesome spirits. They are not considered evil spirits because we learn that spirits do not make such judgements as people do. There is also plenty of Buddhist/Shintoist philosophy here as is usual in anime, reflecting the Japanese culture that produces it. The stories also deal with typical adolescent situations and moral dilemmas. There is also plenty of humor and innuendo, some of it rather seductive! The music is tasteful and consists of Japanese popular songs, with English subtitles(even when the subtitles are off). The animation is imaginative and in the typical anime style. There is an English soundtrack with an optional original Japanese soundtrack with available English subtitles. The style of the English and Japanese soundtracks have subtle differences, but both are quite good. The only special features are an image gallery, songs, and trailers.

1135382,AU3GYRAKBUAEU,B00127R2VU,Jon Norris,"[4, 6]","This is another interesting anime series, mildly different stylistically from Aquarion and the Ghost In The Shell series.This set includes the first four episodes in the series on one DVD. The animation is somewhat simpler than the above mentioned series, but good nonetheless. There are different schools of animation style in the anime genre, but I don't know them well enough to categorize this set.The main story arc is about a sensitive young man named Watanuki who is tormented by spirits and ends up in the company/mentorship of a sexy witch named Yuko. The series deals with important life lessons mixed with spiritual/occult overtones, and does it in an interesting way. Watanuki is a ""drama queen"" in that he has extreme knee-jerk emotional reactions to situations before he really understands what is going on. (Gee, that's unusual for a teenager......)Yuko is a well done blend of mysterious, impish, and wise as she guides him in important life lessons. Watanuki gradually learns to be more patient, more confident, and not to judge things so quickly.I found the animation good even though it was a bit simpler than other series I have seen. The stories were easy to follow, even for a Westerner not schooled in Japanese pop culture. While slightly sexy in places, I did not find it inappropriate or unhealthy. I cannot say the same for Aquarion, which was too focused on violence and combat for my taste.I thought the life lessons and growth Watanuki experienced were valid and more spiritually oriented (no pun intended) than Western cartoons. The characters were well done and made me care enough to want to watch the rest of the series.Some religious people might find the spiritual/occult themes offensive, but there are actually good lessons included, such as not to trust divination methods done as games. (One episode is about the dangers encountered when some schoolgirls get involved with a Ouija board type game.) That will appeal to many who are not comfortable with occult practices, although Yuko's character and other aspects of the series will likely still be problematic for them.I liked the series and look forward to seeing the rest of the episodes at some time. Anime is an interesting art form, and has much to offer.

1135384,A2X7NBUETXC19E,B00127R2VU,Justin G.,"[9, 12]","I'm pretty hard to please when it comes to anime DVDs, but I try to keep an open mind and am always willing to try out new series. Sometimes that pays off (I never would have discovered Escaflowne otherwise) and other times I wish I hadn't bothered. Unfortunately xxxHolic, the latest Clamp series falls into the latter category.The Story: Our protagonist Watanuki is a high school student (big surprise, right) who is cursed to see dark spirits everywhere. One day while fleeing the sprits he encounters a strange shop run by the mysterious witch Yuko, who is able to help him with his problem. In return she enlists his aid at the shop, where all manner of supernatural problems are dealt with.This is an interesting enough concept, and if handled well it could have worked. Unfortunately the things I find most annoying in an anime are all present here - super-exaggerated facial expressions, cutesy pets, high school drama, and weird child characters. I never quite get Japanese humor, and this verges on slapstick at times, taking what might otherwise have been a promising series and making it unwatchable.Character Design/Animation: This is your typical Clamp fare, which means very stylized characters, but not much else. Anime is such a visual medium, so it's frustrating when so little apparent effort is made to make this series look good.Contents: This DVD contains the first four episodes in the series.DVD Extras: This is pretty much a bare bones release as far as special features go. You get an image gallery, trailers, and textless songs.The Verdict: Unless you really love - and I mean love - that quirky Japanese humor, super-exaggerated facial expressions, etc., you'll want to avoid this one.",2,A decent story overwhelmed by annoying characters,1208563200,"04 19, 2008",2008,1713,"[""'m"", 'pretty', 'hard', 'please', 'when', 'anime', 'DVDs', 'try', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'am', 'always', 'willing', 'try', 'out', 'new', 'series', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'discovered', 'Escaflowne', 'otherwise', 'other', 'times', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'Unfortunately', 'xxxHolic', 'latest', 'Clamp', 'series', 'latter', 'category.The', 'Story', 'protagonist', 'Watanuki', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'big', 'surprise', 'right', 'who', 'cursed', 'see', 'dark', 'spirits', 'everywhere', 'One', 'day', 'fleeing', 'sprits', 'strange', 'shop', 'run', 'mysterious', 'witch', 'Yuko', 'who', 'able', 'help', 'problem', 'return', 'aid', 'shop', 'where', 'manner', 'supernatural', 'problems', 'are', 'dealt', 'with.This', 'interesting', 'enough', 'concept', 'handled', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'Unfortunately', 'things', 'find', 'most', 'annoying', 'anime', 'are', 'present', 'here', 'super-exaggerated', 'facial', 'expressions', 'cutesy', 'pets', 'high', 'school', 'drama', 'weird', 'child', 'characters', 'never', 'quite', 'get', 'Japanese', 'humor', 'verges', 'slapstick', 'times', 'taking', 'what', 'might', 'otherwise', 'have', 'been', 'promising', 'series', 'making', 'unwatchable.Character', 'Design/Animation', 'typical', 'Clamp', 'fare', 'very', 'stylized', 'characters', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'Anime', 'such', 'visual', 'medium', 'frustrating', 'when', 'so', 'little', 'apparent', 'effort', 'made', 'make', 'series', 'look', 'good.Contents', 'DVD', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'series.DVD', 'Extras', 'pretty', 'much', 'bare', 'release', 'as', 'far', 'special', 'features', 'go', 'get', 'image', 'gallery', 'trailers', 'textless', 'songs.The', 'Verdict', 'Unless', 'really', 'love', 'mean', 'love', 'Japanese', 'humor', 'super-exaggerated', 'facial', 'expressions', 'etc.', ""'ll"", 'want', 'avoid', 'one']",xxxHOLiC: First Collection

A very high price.Watanuki becomes wrapped up in (some might say ""tricked into"") her world as an employee, alongside Maru and Moro and the overly cute creature Mokona.  While he asks her to remove his ability to be affected by these spirits, Yuki instead finds use for Watanuki's talents.  His ability to see spirits and spells is quite useful in dealing with the problems that beset those who come to Yuki's door...The First Collection collects the first four episodes of this series and is a good introduction to the characters. We get to slowly see more and more about the main characters through the episodes, as well as the type of people drawn to the witch Yuki's shop. It's relative gentle supernatural urban anime (don't be fooled by the ""xxx"" in the title).Questions of destiny, fate and free will are explored in the series, along with much broader situational humor.The production of the anime is lush and well drawn, in keeping with the themes and the characters presented.

Yoku, a seductive psychic who seems to know everything there is know about Watanuki, promises to make his problem go away and offers to grant his wishes (for a price).Soon Watanuki finds himself running her errands and battling evil spirits all the while tying to win the heart of Himawari (his love interest) and trying to make himself look better than Domeki (the handsome impassive athlete).Holic is a must-see for all fans of anime and the paranormal.

Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[12, 18]","So Funimation has finally released CLAMP's much anticipated new anime adaptation ""xxxHOLiC"" in America (and no, I don't know how to pronounce the title).  As with most CLAMP anime the animation is beautiful, the character designs unique (yet familiar to CLAMP fans), and the storyline unique, if nothing else.  The story revolves around a high school student named Watanuki, who ends up working for the Dimensional Witch Yuko in exchange for her to take away his ability that attracts ghosts wherever he goes.  This means Watanuki gets to do mundane chores like cooking, cleaning, and shopping.  However this also means that his services are enlisted to help Yuko with some of her cases that require people with more spiritually honed skills.The first four episodes on this disk gives the viewers very little to chew on.  Mainly, the story at this point boils down to Watanuki helping out Yuko in random cases (some of which are left unsolved).  Watanuki's love interest and rival are also introduced, but at this point they are stereotypes instead of fully developed characters.  The production values of this show are excellent.  So much so, some people may find themselves drawn to the show based on the art style alone.  So why the two stars if this is an interesting show?  Well, I wanted to like this.  I really did.  There's just one thing preventing me from doing so: I hate these people.  And I'm not talking about a simple dislike, I really HATE these people!Yuko has got to be one of the biggest (you know) I've seen in a LONG time!  Watanuki is nothing more then a spineless wimp at the moment, and (as mentioned above) his friends are nothing more then stereotypes.  Add in the annoying twins that spout random nonsense, and an appearence by ""Magic Knight Rayearth's"" mascot (possibly the most overrated and annoying comic relief in the history of anime), and I found myself watching a show that sounds promising, but is annoying me to a high degree.  The show may very well improve in the future, but I found the characters to be unpleasent to be around, and I don't care to finish the story.  This show is a spin off of CLAMP's other (and much better) series ""Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle.""

The animation is gorgeous with brilliant colors and delightful supernatural effects.  Kimihiro Watanuki is the main character.  An orphan boy who is now 19, he deals with the usual problems of a guy his age such as girls, social status & people he doesn't like.  Unfortunately, his screaming and constant complaining make him an irritating leading man, although I believe this is supposed to be humorous.  I liked the way he was drawn into the fortune shop of the magical witch Yuko.  While she is not a nice girl and wears lots of loosely worn kimonos, she is interesting and seems to be a positive character although she does say she sometimes will take a soul as a fee.  The two girl helpers, Maru & Moro, dress Rocco and giggle boundlessly giddy.  Watanumki's crush is on wavy-haired Himawari Kunogi, who is not very clearly defined in these first four episodes.  The stuffed animal Mokona must have some story function, which I did not yet detect.  My favorite character was the stoic Shizuka Domeki who is stone-faced, handsome and popular.  He figures prominently in the ""Angel"" episode.  My favorite episode was ""Falsehood"" with a girl coming to the shop who has a chronic problem of telling lies.  Yuko gives her a ring which emits smoke that only Watanuki can see with each untruth.  I also enjoyed the distinctions between true and false psychics in ""Fortune-Telling.""  This was an interesting animae.  I watched the first three episodes with spoken Japanese and English subtitles.  I found myself pausing frequently because I couldn't keep up reading as fast as the dialogue was zooming out.

It still allowed the show to match traditional Manga elements that most fans would recognize - the way mouths move, characters move, the exaggerated eyes, etc.  The premise of the show is a gawky 19 year old boy in high school? meets a witch and begins helping her solve others' problems.  Usually the problems are of a paranormal nature, so there are plenty of ghosts etc. to satisfy.  The story is bone thin and in my ignorance of much of Manga, I liken the show to Smallville where not much changes but an evil creature tests our hero and herione in every episode.  No matter, they are always successful in their journey.  I found the show enjoyable and pleasant to watch.  The theme songs are catchy too!After watching another Manga show, I would definitely raise the rating on this show to a 5!  It has humor, intelligence and a quality of animation not seen in other shows.

1135392,A2F6NONFUDB6UK,B00127R2VU,Malvin,"[2, 4]","I recently had the pleasure of viewing the first Funimation installment of xxxHolic, a seinen series created by the esteemed CLAMP production team of Japan. This popular series may already be familiar to many individuals reading this review, so this review will be split into two paragraphs; the first dealing with my thoughts about the contents of this excellent show, and the second dealing with the DVD itself.This particular DVD offers four episodes in the series. xxxHolic is a fantasy set in modern times, one where spirits and ghosts are very real forces in the world and with characters who are binded in the traditional ideals of Japanese mysticism and destiny. The show offers a good mix of light-hearted comedy and surrealist, dark and moral themes. While the storylines makes heavy references to mystical aspects of fate, spirits, posession, etc., the plot centers on everyday human interactions and desires. The anime seems to be episodic in nature, meaning that one doesn't necessarily need to marathon the anime in order to ""get it""; each episode is self-contained and usually focuses on some sort of moral lesson that is applicable to our day-to-day lives. Examples include: individuals lying about the superficial in order to give them a feeling of self-worth; the pitfalls of transferring one's hardships to another; and the underlying dangers lurking inside our deepest desires. There isn't much action or ecchi material, but the plot is well developed and the character designs are rendered nicely in a traditional, colorful, Gothic-Lolita style. The dialogue is also strong and mildly thought-provoking, but from what I've seen thus far this series doesn't have the high-brow intellectual churning of a series like Ergo Proxy (which many viewers might welcome).With respect to a technical review of the DVD, Funimation has been doing beautifully thus far with its handling of Japanese Anime. In an age where Western fans have all too often been subjected to horrible dubs, un-necessary censorship, and overall shoddy translations of Japanese works, Funimation seems to be doing all the right things. Nothing is edited out or altered in the name of ""censorship""; the original opening and ending theme songs have not been dubbed-over or thrown away; and the English voice acting is actually quite good! The subtitles are also accurrate and do not have any syncing problems with the animation itself. Although there aren't any special features of real note -- just the usual trailers for other productions -- we are more than satisfied with a good, solid presentation. In short, the DVD delivers the basic satisfactory components one would want for a quality viewing experience.Overall, if you're a fan of the manga or the anime, or a fan of CLAMP in particular, you will find this to be a worthy buy. If you're looking for some light-hearted and mildly (but not deeply) thought provoking material, I highly recommend the xxxHolic series!",5,Light-hearted and thought provoking,1216252800,"07 17, 2008",2008,2956,"['recently', 'had', 'pleasure', 'viewing', 'first', 'Funimation', 'installment', 'xxxHolic', 'seinen', 'series', 'created', 'esteemed', 'CLAMP', 'production', 'team', 'Japan', 'popular', 'series', 'may', 'already', 'be', 'familiar', 'many', 'individuals', 'reading', 'review', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'split', 'two', 'paragraphs', 'first', 'dealing', 'thoughts', 'contents', 'excellent', 'show', 'second', 'dealing', 'DVD', 'itself.This', 'particular', 'DVD', 'four', 'episodes', 'series', 'xxxHolic', 'fantasy', 'set', 'modern', 'times', 'one', 'where', 'spirits', 'ghosts', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'forces', 'world', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'binded', 'traditional', 'ideals', 'Japanese', 'mysticism', 'destiny', 'show', 'good', 'mix', 'light-hearted', 'comedy', 'surrealist', 'dark', 'moral', 'themes', 'storylines', 'heavy', 'references', 'mystical', 'aspects', 'fate', 'spirits', 'posession', 'etc.', 'plot', 'centers', 'everyday', 'human', 'interactions', 'desires', 'anime', 'be', 'episodic', 'nature', 'meaning', 'one', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'need', 'marathon', 'anime', 'order', 'get', 'episode', 'self-contained', 'usually', 'sort', 'moral', 'lesson', 'applicable', 'day-to-day', 'lives', 'Examples', 'include', 'individuals', 'lying', 'superficial', 'order', 'give', 'feeling', 'self-worth', 'pitfalls', 'transferring', 'one', 'hardships', 'underlying', 'dangers', 'lurking', 'deepest', 'desires', ""n't"", 'much', 'action', 'ecchi', 'material', 'plot', 'well', 'developed', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'rendered', 'nicely', 'traditional', 'colorful', 'Gothic-Lolita', 'style', 'dialogue', 'also', 'strong', 'mildly', 'thought-provoking', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thus', 'far', 'series', ""n't"", 'have', 'high-brow', 'intellectual', 'churning', 'series', 'Ergo', 'Proxy', 'many', 'viewers', 'might', 'welcome', '.With', 'respect', 'technical', 'review', 'DVD', 'Funimation', 'been', 'doing', 'beautifully', 'thus', 'far', 'handling', 'Japanese', 'Anime', 'age', 'where', 'Western', 'fans', 'have', 'too', 'often', 'been', 'subjected', 'horrible', 'dubs', 'un-necessary', 'censorship', 'overall', 'shoddy', 'translations', 'Japanese', 'works', 'Funimation', 'be', 'doing', 'right', 'things', 'Nothing', 'edited', 'out', 'altered', 'name', 'censorship', 'original', 'opening', 'ending', 'theme', 'songs', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'dubbed-over', 'thrown', 'away', 'English', 'voice', 'acting', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'subtitles', 'are', 'also', 'accurrate', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'syncing', 'problems', 'animation', 'are', ""n't"", 'special', 'features', 'real', 'note', 'just', 'usual', 'trailers', 'other', 'productions', 'are', 'more', 'satisfied', 'good', 'solid', 'presentation', 'short', 'DVD', 'basic', 'satisfactory', 'components', 'one', 'would', 'want', 'quality', 'viewing', 'experience.Overall', ""'re"", 'fan', 'manga', 'anime', 'fan', 'CLAMP', 'particular', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'worthy', 'buy', ""'re"", 'looking', 'light-hearted', 'mildly', 'not', 'deeply', 'thought', 'provoking', 'material', 'highly', 'recommend', 'xxxHolic', 'series']",xxxHOLiC: First Collection

1135394,ABOTQXNUBA1MM,B00127R2VU,Mark F. Braun,"[5, 7]","To get a good feel for this anime series, I had two of our Eiseenhower Public Library's ZOMO group look it over as they're 100% anime and comic devotees; This review is by Nicole Manning:Destiny - we all know what that means - some poor schmuck's life is going to be changed thanks to some inevitable event. Key word is inevitable here, as this is the name of the first episode in this new series by the very popular shoujo artists known as CLAMP, creators of beautiful masterpieces like Cardcaptor Sakura, X/1999, Chobits, and Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, among others.Anyway, using destiny and fate as an excuse to make a character miserable (did I say miserable? I meant happy! No, wait, miserable is the right word) is a formula that never fails to deliver. Point in case - Watanuki Kimihiro - a high school student who has the ability to see spirits. Of course, this is a burden, as the spirits tend to follow and latch onto the poor guy. At the start of the episode, it's quite obvious he hates this, and tries running away, only to end up falling flat on his face in front of a curious looking house. Somehow he feels compelled to investigate it, then tries to ignore it - but is then literally dragged in by a mysterious force.Enter Yuko, an elegant looking woman with white skin, very long black hair, red droopy eyes, and a mystical aura about her. She tells Watanuki that it was inevitable that they met, and says that she can grant him any wish he wants - for a price. He's skeptical, naturally, but eventually gives in, wishing his ability away to see spirits. In exchange, he must work for her part-time, serving her every whim. The series goes on, following his new life working for this strange but interesting witchy woman. Other characters include Yuko's other servants (or pets? I can't tell sometimes, with the way they act) Moro and Maru, Mokona (if you are familiar with CLAMP's work, you will recognize this very cute creature), two of Watanuki's fellow students Himawari (who he has a crush on), and Domeki (his rival who he hates).The animation is very beautiful and crisp, doing justice to CLAMP's graphic novel work. The music is good, and the dialogue amusing. The story doesn't really get too serious, filled with tons of anime-styled reactions in the form of waterfall tears, huge sweat drops, and big angry eyes complete with large pointy teeth to convey annoyance.The modern-supernatural genre has been done by CLAMP before, but xxxHOLIC is definitely their best by far. Character designs are solid, but Yuko outdoes them all, with her gothic dresses and mesmerizing eyes. If you're a fan of CLAMP, and/or looking for an interesting new anime to watch, this DVD (with 4 episodes and an image gallery extra) is definitely worth checking out.",4,xxxHOLIC is definitely CLAMP's best by far,1208649600,"04 20, 2008",2008,2773,"['get', 'good', 'feel', 'anime', 'series', 'had', 'two', 'Eiseenhower', 'Public', 'Library', 'ZOMO', 'group', 'look', 'over', ""'re"", '100', '%', 'anime', 'comic', 'devotees', 'review', 'Nicole', 'Manning', 'Destiny', 'know', 'what', 'poor', 'schmuck', 'life', 'going', 'be', 'changed', 'thanks', 'inevitable', 'event', 'Key', 'word', 'inevitable', 'here', 'name', 'first', 'episode', 'new', 'series', 'very', 'popular', 'shoujo', 'artists', 'known', 'CLAMP', 'creators', 'beautiful', 'masterpieces', 'Cardcaptor', 'Sakura', 'X/1999', 'Chobits', 'Tsubasa', 'Reservoir', 'Chronicle', 'others.Anyway', 'using', 'destiny', 'fate', 'excuse', 'make', 'character', 'miserable', 'did', 'say', 'miserable', 'meant', 'happy', 'No', 'wait', 'miserable', 'right', 'word', 'formula', 'never', 'deliver', 'Point', 'case', 'Watanuki', 'Kimihiro', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'ability', 'see', 'spirits', 'course', 'burden', 'spirits', 'tend', 'follow', 'latch', 'poor', 'guy', 'start', 'episode', 'quite', 'obvious', 'tries', 'running', 'away', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'flat', 'face', 'front', 'curious', 'looking', 'house', 'compelled', 'investigate', 'then', 'ignore', 'then', 'literally', 'dragged', 'mysterious', 'force.Enter', 'Yuko', 'elegant', 'looking', 'woman', 'white', 'skin', 'very', 'long', 'black', 'hair', 'red', 'droopy', 'eyes', 'mystical', 'aura', 'was', 'inevitable', 'met', 'can', 'grant', 'wish', 'price', 'skeptical', 'naturally', 'eventually', 'wishing', 'ability', 'away', 'see', 'spirits', 'exchange', 'must', 'work', 'part-time', 'serving', 'whim', 'series', 'following', 'new', 'life', 'working', 'strange', 'interesting', 'witchy', 'woman', 'Other', 'characters', 'include', 'Yuko', 'other', 'servants', 'pets', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'sometimes', 'way', 'act', 'Moro', 'Maru', 'Mokona', 'are', 'familiar', 'CLAMP', 'work', 'will', 'recognize', 'very', 'cute', 'creature', 'two', 'Watanuki', 'fellow', 'students', 'Himawari', 'who', 'crush', 'Domeki', 'rival', 'who', '.The', 'animation', 'very', 'beautiful', 'crisp', 'doing', 'justice', 'CLAMP', 'graphic', 'novel', 'work', 'music', 'good', 'dialogue', 'amusing', 'story', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'too', 'serious', 'filled', 'tons', 'anime-styled', 'reactions', 'form', 'waterfall', 'tears', 'huge', 'sweat', 'drops', 'big', 'angry', 'eyes', 'complete', 'large', 'pointy', 'teeth', 'convey', 'annoyance.The', 'modern-supernatural', 'genre', 'been', 'done', 'CLAMP', 'xxxHOLIC', 'definitely', 'best', 'far', 'Character', 'designs', 'are', 'solid', 'Yuko', 'gothic', 'dresses', 'mesmerizing', 'eyes', ""'re"", 'fan', 'CLAMP', 'looking', 'interesting', 'new', 'anime', 'watch', 'DVD', '4', 'episodes', 'image', 'gallery', 'extra', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",xxxHOLiC: First Collection
1135395,A17BUUBOU0598B,B00127R2VU,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[9, 12]","xxxHOLiC: First CollectionI love the xxxHolic book series, which can best be described as philosophical anime with a dash of high school angst and the supernatural.  I think most people who are drawn to this TV version will be fans of the booksxxxHOLiC, Volume 1.  While I still like the writing that has made its way to the show, not all hard-core fans will be pleased with the DVD version.The StoryOur main character Watanuki can see spirits, who seem to be drawn to him. He stumbles upon Yuko, who seems to already know his problem and is willing to solve it for a price.  Yuko's ability to grant wishes is reminiscent of many stories about the devil, who always has a price.  Watanuki's price is that he becomes her servant, and a series of adventures ensue.Like all high school boys, Watanuki has a crush, Himawara, and a nemesis, Doumeki.  In an ironic twist, he is forced to join with both of them to complete his tasks.Once again, hard-core fans will already be familiar with the basic story.The GoodThe writing includes a lot of riddles and philosophical dialogue to make you think.  So in that sense this is a thought provoking anime.  Still, there's a lot of childish elements too, including the two girl helpers and the talking doll which I personally might have toned down.  In that sense, this anime can appeal to younger and older fans alike.Still the core elements of the books are here.  That includes some beautiful character silhouettes and beautifully done art sequences for the opening.There are some funny and clever double entendres here, one in particular to open the second episode.  In that sense, this anime is perhaps more engaging than many others.  Still, the high school themes highlight the fact that just like most anime this one is geared towards kids too.  Precocious kids, but kids nonetheless.While the first episode is somewhat light, laying the foundation, the other three get progressively better.The BadThe first negative I have to note isn't about the episodes but rather the extremely small amount of content on this disk.  These episodes are meant to last 30 minutes with commercials, making the DVD versions about 20 minutes.  I just feel that they could have either included more episodes or priced these better.There are no real special features to think of either.  The disk includes some images and the opening and closing themes to the show without the credits.  They are both catchy Japanese pop, but I have a feeling that most Japanese people would not consider these the best music they have to offer.Another thing I was not happy with, which I noticed on another Clamp release as well, is the lack of Japanese character subtitles.  I find original character subtitles helpful in deciphering some questionable translations.I also like to read subtitles even with the English dub just to make sure I catch everything.  Strangely, the English subtitles are only activated when Japanese is spoken, which isn't very useful.  In order to access subtitles, you have to choose the Japanese option and then the English subtitles come up.  I personally always like to see subtitles even with voice-overs.Comparing the japanese translations to the voice over dialogue reveals some interesting variances and some cultural differences that were certainly lost in translation.As far as the animation goes, like I said I love the opening sequence and several elements.  But they seem to have done too many direct transfers from the book series, which sometimes leads to two-dimensional images of characters.  While some characters, particularly Yuko, always seem to be animated with great detail, Watanuki looks like more time could have been spent enhancing his character for the screen.ConclusionI think the starter set is a better value than the first collection, because at least you get a box to hold the disksxxxHOLiC: Starter Set.  No doubt, if you're a hard-core fan of Holic, you will be buying all the coming collections anyway.  The second collection is soon to be released in May and the third collection is due in June.  While I think this series is cool and will still please many hard core fans, it may only appeal to a small audience beyond those core fans.Enjoy!",3,xxxHolic - Anime DVD Series based on Popular Book Series,1207785600,"04 10, 2008",2008,4218,"['xxxHOLiC', 'First', 'CollectionI', 'love', 'xxxHolic', 'book', 'series', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'philosophical', 'anime', 'dash', 'high', 'school', 'angst', 'supernatural', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'drawn', 'TV', 'version', 'will', 'be', 'fans', 'booksxxxHOLiC', 'Volume', '1', 'still', 'writing', 'made', 'way', 'show', 'not', 'hard-core', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'DVD', 'version.The', 'StoryOur', 'main', 'character', 'Watanuki', 'can', 'see', 'spirits', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'drawn', 'Yuko', 'who', 'already', 'know', 'problem', 'willing', 'solve', 'price', 'Yuko', 'ability', 'grant', 'wishes', 'reminiscent', 'many', 'stories', 'devil', 'who', 'always', 'price', 'Watanuki', 'price', 'servant', 'series', 'adventures', 'high', 'school', 'boys', 'Watanuki', 'crush', 'Himawara', 'nemesis', 'Doumeki', 'ironic', 'twist', 'forced', 'join', 'complete', 'tasks.Once', 'again', 'hard-core', 'fans', 'will', 'already', 'be', 'familiar', 'basic', 'story.The', 'GoodThe', 'writing', 'lot', 'riddles', 'philosophical', 'dialogue', 'make', 'think', 'So', 'sense', 'thought', 'provoking', 'anime', 'Still', 'lot', 'childish', 'elements', 'too', 'including', 'two', 'girl', 'helpers', 'talking', 'doll', 'personally', 'might', 'have', 'toned', 'down', 'sense', 'anime', 'can', 'appeal', 'younger', 'older', 'fans', 'alike.Still', 'core', 'elements', 'books', 'are', 'here', 'beautiful', 'character', 'silhouettes', 'beautifully', 'done', 'art', 'sequences', 'are', 'funny', 'clever', 'double', 'entendres', 'here', 'one', 'particular', 'open', 'second', 'episode', 'sense', 'anime', 'perhaps', 'more', 'engaging', 'many', 'others', 'Still', 'high', 'school', 'themes', 'highlight', 'fact', 'just', 'most', 'anime', 'one', 'geared', 'towards', 'kids', 'too', 'Precocious', 'kids', 'kids', 'first', 'episode', 'somewhat', 'light', 'laying', 'foundation', 'other', 'three', 'get', 'progressively', 'better.The', 'BadThe', 'first', 'negative', 'have', 'note', ""n't"", 'episodes', 'rather', 'extremely', 'small', 'amount', 'content', 'disk', 'episodes', 'are', 'meant', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'commercials', 'making', 'DVD', 'versions', '20', 'minutes', 'just', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'included', 'more', 'episodes', 'priced', 'are', 'real', 'special', 'features', 'think', 'disk', 'images', 'opening', 'closing', 'themes', 'show', 'credits', 'are', 'catchy', 'Japanese', 'pop', 'have', 'feeling', 'most', 'Japanese', 'people', 'would', 'not', 'consider', 'best', 'music', 'have', 'offer.Another', 'thing', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'noticed', 'Clamp', 'release', 'as', 'well', 'lack', 'Japanese', 'character', 'subtitles', 'find', 'original', 'character', 'subtitles', 'helpful', 'deciphering', 'questionable', 'translations.I', 'also', 'read', 'subtitles', 'even', 'English', 'dub', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'catch', 'everything', 'Strangely', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'only', 'activated', 'when', 'Japanese', 'spoken', ""n't"", 'very', 'useful', 'order', 'access', 'subtitles', 'have', 'choose', 'Japanese', 'option', 'then', 'English', 'subtitles', 'come', 'up', 'personally', 'always', 'see', 'subtitles', 'even', 'voice-overs.Comparing', 'japanese', 'translations', 'voice', 'dialogue', 'reveals', 'interesting', 'variances', 'cultural', 'differences', 'were', 'certainly', 'lost', 'translation.As', 'far', 'animation', 'said', 'love', 'opening', 'sequence', 'several', 'elements', 'seem', 'have', 'done', 'too', 'many', 'direct', 'transfers', 'book', 'series', 'sometimes', 'two-dimensional', 'images', 'characters', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Yuko', 'always', 'seem', 'be', 'animated', 'great', 'detail', 'Watanuki', 'more', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'enhancing', 'character', 'screen.ConclusionI', 'think', 'starter', 'set', 'better', 'value', 'first', 'collection', 'least', 'get', 'box', 'hold', 'disksxxxHOLiC', 'Starter', 'Set', 'No', 'doubt', ""'re"", 'hard-core', 'fan', 'Holic', 'will', 'be', 'buying', 'coming', 'collections', 'anyway', 'second', 'collection', 'soon', 'be', 'released', 'May', 'third', 'collection', 'due', 'June', 'think', 'series', 'cool', 'will', 'still', 'please', 'many', 'hard', 'core', 'fans', 'may', 'only', 'appeal', 'small', 'audience', 'core', 'fans.Enjoy']",xxxHOLiC: First Collection

1135397,A3VWGPUMJMVD1I,B00127R2VU,mellion108,"[3, 5]","I was curious about this DVD. I'm rather new to anime and manga, and the description of this series sounded interesting.Visually this is a rather captivating series to watch even though some of the animation seems, for lack of a better word and at risk of sounding insane, cartoonish. Watanuki spends far too much time screaming and sounding like something out of a Scooby Doo cartoon for my taste - he is rather annoying. I like Yuko, however, and would continue to watch this for her character alone. The twins? Creepy and also somewhat annoying.I like the dark overtones of the series, but I could definitely do without the theme music - whew! I kept fast forwarding through that. The DVD itself has very few features. There is a gallery and some trailers, but that's it for the extras.I had planned to pass this DVD on to my 11-year-old nephew, but I think it's just a bit above his age level right now with the smoking, drinking and revealing outfits of Yuko - I like her character, but she is definitely the stereotypically sexy, long-legged, large-breasted female, and she is usually dressed in revealing outfits. This didn't stop me from liking her, but this characterization always makes me imagine 15-year-old boys sitting in a dark room, drawing cartoons of what they think women look like.

1135398,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B00127R2VU,Mel Odom,"[0, 2]","Based on a successful line of manga, XXXHOLIC presents a paranormal world filled with ghosts and demons, and heroes in the making.  Watanuki Kimihiro has been cursed with seeing ghosts his whole life.  At 19, although his character sounds and acts much younger in the anime series, he finds a witch's shop.  Yuko, the witch, promises him that she can take away his burden, but she wants him to help her in exchange.It doesn't take long before Watanuki gets paired up with the usual supportive and egregious sidekicks.  This time they're Shizuka Domeki and Himawari Kunogi.  Shizuka is the annoying guy that constantly gets under Watanuki's skin, but he crushes on Himawari.The storytelling is sometimes uneven and sophomoric, but the episodes are overall fun and lively.  Definitely not for the younger anime lovers, tough, because there are some adult issues addressed and hinted at.  The art takes some getting used to.  I found that it was too ""soft"" for me at first.  The frames occasionally looked a little blurry, but I know that was the effect the artist was going for.

1135399,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B00127R2VU,Monty Moonlight,"[3, 4]","Kimihiro Watanuki is a male student who lives on his own, his parents having died when he was a child. He is plagued with a strange ability to see and attract spirits, an ability he is desperate to be rid of. Enter Yko Ichihara, a dimensional witch who has a mysterious shop Watanuki stumbles into one day. Ichihara sells wishes, but always for a price. She is willing to grant Watanuki's wish to be rid of his ability, but in return he must first work as an assistant/housekeeper of sorts until she decides he has sufficiently paid for the service. This involves more than just the constant cooking (it seems Ichihara and her small staff are always hungry), but also helping with Ichihara's work, through which Watanuki learns valuable lessons about human nature and the nature of the supernatural world.xxxHOLiC is an Anime (Japanese Animation) series based on a manga from the ladies of CLAMP, and therefore is part of the CLAMP universe (which probably only matters to you if you're a CLAMP fan already) that includes other titles such as Cardcaptor Sakura and Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle. This ""First Collection"" DVD from Funimation is a great introduction to the series, which is very intriguing, though not at all as mature as I expected it to be. Of course, one can't say too much about that after only four episodes. That's the only complaint I have about the DVD itself, that it only holds the first four episodes. Of course, that is not unusual for an Anime DVD release I think, and neither is the very small selection of extras (a rather pointless image gallery, the opening and closing song sequences without the credits, and several trailers for other Anime releases including this one and the xxxHOLiC feature that preceded it). In saying that the show is not as mature as I expected, well, let's just say that I felt a bit like I was watching a darker Sailor Moon series at times, minus schoolgirl superhero stuff. That's okay with me since I was always a big Sailor Moon fan, still am, and this show is a bit more mature than that, but not so much as I expected from the trailer. Of course, again, I've only seen the first four episodes, and it seems a big part of this story is probably about having the very basic and immature characters grow and mature over time. Episode 1: The Inevitable, is about Watanuki's first encounter with Ichihara, becoming her employee, and learning a lesson about how some people invite suffering into their lives. Episode 2: Falsehood, is about a customer with a habit of lying, teaching Watanuki that a person must discover and remedy some problems on their own. Episode 3: Angel, has Watanuki teaming up with a schoolmate he cannot stand, the always calm and cool Dmeki, to solve a mystery about a Ouija board-like game at the request of Watanuki's big crush, the lovely Kunogi (as Dmeki and Kunogi become more important to the cast it would seem). Lastly, Episode 4: Fortune Telling, is a very straightforward lesson for Watanuki about telling real fortune tellers from false ones.I am truly glad to have been introduced to xxxHOLiC through this DVD. It's a simple show so far, but very interesting, and I found myself always eager to watch the next episode. I definitely would like to see the rest, even though I had to adjust to the lanky design of the characters, which is one thing I'm not particularly fond of.",5,"A simple show so far, but very intriguing!",1207785600,"04 10, 2008",2008,3369,"['Kimihiro', 'Watanuki', 'male', 'student', 'who', 'own', 'parents', 'having', 'died', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'plagued', 'strange', 'ability', 'see', 'attract', 'spirits', 'ability', 'desperate', 'be', 'rid', 'Enter', 'Yko', 'Ichihara', 'dimensional', 'witch', 'who', 'mysterious', 'shop', 'Watanuki', 'one', 'day', 'Ichihara', 'wishes', 'always', 'price', 'willing', 'grant', 'Watanuki', 'wish', 'be', 'rid', 'ability', 'return', 'must', 'first', 'work', 'assistant/housekeeper', 'sorts', 'sufficiently', 'paid', 'service', 'more', 'just', 'constant', 'cooking', 'Ichihara', 'small', 'staff', 'are', 'always', 'hungry', 'also', 'helping', 'Ichihara', 'work', 'Watanuki', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'human', 'nature', 'nature', 'supernatural', 'world.xxxHOLiC', 'Anime', 'Japanese', 'Animation', 'series', 'based', 'manga', 'ladies', 'CLAMP', 'therefore', 'part', 'CLAMP', 'universe', 'probably', 'only', 'matters', ""'re"", 'CLAMP', 'fan', 'already', 'other', 'titles', 'such', 'Cardcaptor', 'Sakura', 'Tsubasa', 'Reservoir', 'Chronicle', 'First', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'Funimation', 'great', 'introduction', 'series', 'very', 'intriguing', 'not', 'all', 'as', 'mature', 'expected', 'be', 'course', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'too', 'much', 'only', 'four', 'episodes', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'DVD', 'only', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'course', 'not', 'unusual', 'Anime', 'DVD', 'release', 'think', 'very', 'small', 'selection', 'extras', 'rather', 'pointless', 'image', 'gallery', 'opening', 'closing', 'song', 'sequences', 'credits', 'several', 'trailers', 'other', 'Anime', 'including', 'one', 'xxxHOLiC', 'feature', 'preceded', 'saying', 'show', 'not', 'as', 'mature', 'expected', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'felt', 'bit', 'was', 'watching', 'darker', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'series', 'times', 'schoolgirl', 'superhero', 'stuff', 'okay', 'was', 'always', 'big', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'fan', 'still', 'am', 'show', 'bit', 'more', 'mature', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'expected', 'trailer', 'course', 'again', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'big', 'part', 'story', 'probably', 'having', 'very', 'basic', 'immature', 'characters', 'grow', 'mature', 'time', '1', 'Inevitable', 'Watanuki', 'first', 'encounter', 'Ichihara', 'becoming', 'employee', 'learning', 'lesson', 'how', 'people', 'invite', 'suffering', 'lives', '2', 'Falsehood', 'customer', 'habit', 'lying', 'teaching', 'Watanuki', 'person', 'must', 'discover', 'remedy', 'problems', 'own', '3', 'Angel', 'Watanuki', 'teaming', 'up', 'schoolmate', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'always', 'calm', 'cool', 'Dmeki', 'solve', 'mystery', 'Ouija', 'board-like', 'game', 'request', 'Watanuki', 'big', 'crush', 'lovely', 'Kunogi', 'Dmeki', 'Kunogi', 'become', 'more', 'important', 'cast', 'would', 'seem', 'Lastly', 'Episode', '4', 'Fortune', 'Telling', 'very', 'straightforward', 'lesson', 'Watanuki', 'telling', 'real', 'fortune', 'tellers', 'false', 'ones.I', 'am', 'truly', 'glad', 'have', 'been', 'introduced', 'xxxHOLiC', 'DVD', 'simple', 'show', 'so', 'far', 'very', 'interesting', 'found', 'always', 'eager', 'watch', 'next', 'episode', 'definitely', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'rest', 'even', 'had', 'adjust', 'lanky', 'design', 'characters', 'one', 'thing', ""'m"", 'not', 'particularly', 'fond']",xxxHOLiC: First Collection
1135400,A2DN7RUNX06BZ1,B00127R2VU,nychen,"[3, 6]","I admit, I am intrigued with anime/manga, but I haven't seen any actual tv shows in awhile, or maybe ever. My anime movies go more dark and adult like ""Grave of the Fireflies"" or ""Perfect Blue,"" so this ""xxxHolic"" series was definitely out of my normal pick. ""xxxHolic"" is alot more humor-based, cutesy, easy to understand but interwoven fables [stories that tell life lessons/morals] than it is a drama or thriller, which is what I had previously thought when I got this DVD, based on seeing the cover all dark and eyecatching, and then the ""xxx"" title made me think this series was geared towards adults, but it's slightly more teen/young adult.Although the DVD is listed in episodes, when you watch, it's more like a movie that's 1 hour 36 minutes long, so in any movie, the first 30 minutes [1st episode] is all about character setup and basic plot. In less than 10 minutes, I would have given up and turned the channel due to the crude line work and simplicity of animation...but by the 2nd 30 minutes [2nd episode], the story definitely got better. The 3rd 30 minutes [3rd episode] has the funniest part about the headphones! When you see that scene, you'll laugh out loud! Also the interaction between the over-reacting Watanuki and subdued Domaki is hilarious! The last episode is about fortune-telling and astrology, Yuko said it best: ""Any prediction true or false, should not be made lightly, it can still alter a person's path.""There are a few delicious quotes from one of the characters, Yuko: ""The lies that the girl was telling were for her own sake, nobody elses, it wouldn't make a difference if I told her to stop, even if she knew the consequences."" That in itself seems very mature and I really think the series is starting to draw interest.Another quote from Yuko: ""In this world there is only one possible past for all of us, but it contains an infinite number of futures."" That probably best sums up this ""xxxHolic"" series for me, this series is about a young man named Watanuki who meets with a spiritual shopowner named Yuko, and he learns lessons from encountering people who visit the store and whom he meets in everyday life.""Shall I grant your wish"" is the start of all the episodes/stories. The episode previews inbetween are all very intriguing and pulls you into continuing to watch the series. I enjoy the character of Yuko most, she's mysterious and unpredictable in what she says/does, compared to the sometimes annoying characters of Watanuki and the 2 echo-lic girls Maru and Moro. The little black pet Mokona reminds me of those famous Japanese Pokemons...most annoying. Not sure why the characters are drawn like tall/thin stick-figures from ""Nightmare Before Christmas.""While there are moments of teeny-booperness in the animation and speech, there are also moments of introspective thought and questioning, which are the parts I enjoyed. Oh yeah, there's crazy humor and funny manga/comic-style facial features/actions too! Overall, an interesting series for the younger generation who enjoys comics but want to go into slightly more mature material.I wasn't expecting much from the ""xxxHolic"" series, since I had never known it was a manga before it is now anime also, but I do recommend it. The 4 episodes were light and very funny while woven with intellectual comments/quotes. I would continue watching the series if it were to become available on TV, or easy rentals.""Time for more Sake!""",4,"""Time for more Sake!""

In fact, I am a big fan of Speed Racer and both Superman and Batman, the Animated Series. Watanuki whined and threw tantrums every few minutes.

I was very surprised when I finished writing this review and went to the product page to find it was rated PG14. It seemed too silly for that age group. In fact, I don't know where I would place it.

1135406,A9LNWA25IM2DX,B00127R2VU,"R.Suarez ""R-Suarez-""","[5, 6]","Attracted by the product description and being a fan of anime I decided to order Holic:  First collection.First of all, and like many other examples around, this collection contains only 4 episodes, with the complete season already aired and the second one currently showing in Japan you would expect a set containing the complete season 1. Instead, this release shows to be another attempt to sell separate groups of chapters rather than selling a complete set at a more reasonable price (which will surely be released after all the collections are available)The story is about a kid cursed to have spirits not visible to others attracted to him, one day he stops by a shop where a mysterious character named Yuko offers him to get rid of his curse, in exchange, he will have to work for her. The first episode was slow-paced and kind of boring, once it's been established which course the series will follow I found the following chapters to be entertaining, I particularly liked the story about the girl with the ""bad habit"". Among the extras there is a trailer for the movie and the rest of the volumes, the glimpses of the following chapters look promising. Being from the same creators (Clamp), in the following episodes characters from other anime series make special appearances (i.e. characters from Cardcaptor Sakura and  Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle), so if you've seen those other series you know what to expect from ""Holic""There were two things I didn't like: one was the character designs; this is the type of anime in which according to the character's expressions or feelings their drawing will change style to reflect that; the other thing I thought could have been better is the animation, while not bad, it is not too well elaborated; for example, everytime a character walks on the street all the people around him are gray silhouettes, at first I thought it was an artistic choice to reflect something but being this a constant in all episodes I assumed it was not, this type of things make the animation look cheap.Extras include an image gallery with screenshots from the show (not even concept art or the like), the Intro and Outro songs from the show without the credits and trailers from other DVDs from Funimation.",2,Interesting plot... animation could have been better,1210118400,"05 7, 2008",2008,2241,"['Attracted', 'product', 'description', 'being', 'fan', 'anime', 'decided', 'order', 'Holic', 'First', 'collection.First', 'many', 'other', 'examples', 'collection', 'only', '4', 'episodes', 'complete', 'season', 'already', 'aired', 'second', 'one', 'currently', 'showing', 'Japan', 'would', 'expect', 'set', 'containing', 'complete', 'season', '1', 'Instead', 'release', 'be', 'attempt', 'sell', 'separate', 'groups', 'chapters', 'rather', 'selling', 'complete', 'set', 'more', 'reasonable', 'price', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'released', 'collections', 'are', 'available', 'story', 'kid', 'cursed', 'have', 'spirits', 'not', 'visible', 'others', 'attracted', 'one', 'day', 'shop', 'where', 'mysterious', 'character', 'named', 'Yuko', 'get', 'rid', 'curse', 'exchange', 'will', 'have', 'work', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'slow-paced', 'kind', 'boring', 'been', 'established', 'course', 'series', 'will', 'follow', 'found', 'following', 'chapters', 'be', 'entertaining', 'particularly', 'liked', 'story', 'girl', 'bad', 'habit', 'extras', 'trailer', 'movie', 'rest', 'volumes', 'glimpses', 'following', 'chapters', 'look', 'promising', 'Being', 'same', 'creators', 'Clamp', 'following', 'episodes', 'characters', 'other', 'anime', 'series', 'make', 'special', 'appearances', 'i.e', 'characters', 'Cardcaptor', 'Sakura', 'Tsubasa', 'Reservoir', 'Chronicle', 'so', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'series', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Holic', 'were', 'two', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'one', 'was', 'character', 'type', 'anime', 'according', 'character', 'expressions', 'feelings', 'drawing', 'will', 'change', 'style', 'reflect', 'other', 'thing', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'animation', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'too', 'well', 'elaborated', 'example', 'character', 'walks', 'street', 'people', 'are', 'gray', 'silhouettes', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'artistic', 'choice', 'reflect', 'something', 'being', 'constant', 'episodes', 'assumed', 'was', 'not', 'type', 'things', 'make', 'animation', 'look', 'cheap.Extras', 'include', 'image', 'gallery', 'screenshots', 'show', 'not', 'even', 'concept', 'art', 'like', 'Intro', 'Outro', 'songs', 'show', 'credits', 'trailers', 'other', 'DVDs', 'Funimation']",xxxHOLiC: First Collection

This is the first DVD from the TV series and contains 4 episodes.Watanuki is a high school student who is cursed with the ability to see spirits who torment him. One day he is mysteriously pulled into the shop of a beautiful witch/ fortune teller named Yuko. She says she is in the business of granting wishes. She gets him to admit that he wishes to stop seeing spirits. She says she will grant the wish once he has paid her by working in her shop doing chores and cooking. Thus starts their relationship which is the basis for the episodes of the series.I enjoyed it, but was also annoyed by all the yelling and whining that Watanuki does. That gets very old very fast. The plots of the first 4 episodes were not that involved. Overall I think this is a series geared more for teen girls.

From the first scenes of the first episode, when our hero, the 19 year old school boy Watanuki is walking along a cityscape where all of the other human figures are rendered in gray blocky style, I was caught up in this story of magic and learning.The ""x"" in the title does not mean it has anything to do with porn and while the series can be ""read"" on a simple level that would appeal to probably age 10 and up (it has some amusing innuendo at the beginning of the 3rd episode, but it's very brief and innocuous)-- the more the viewer is willing to give to the series, the more multilayered and rich it seems.The story arc is moved along by Watanuki meeting various individuals all of whom have an affect on his character development beginning with Yuko, a beautiful witch who operates a ""wish"" shop.  At times mischievous and demanding, at other times wise and sage-like, Yuko bargains and tricks Watanuki into becoming her parttime employee.  He is a very good cook, but his grumblings and temper often cause him to overlook potential culinary disasters until it is too late. He behaves rashly at times but is well intended.  He has a crush on a beautiful girl at his school and is engaged in a rivalry with a schoolmate, Doumeki, his polar opposite in personality.Watanuki is a fully realized character.  His volatility seems age appropriate as well as the problems he is working through-- from the evil spirits that are attracted to him to his early loss of parental figures.  I did not find him irritating, but rather amusing and sweet.  He has some obvious good qualities even if he does lose his temper easily.  His love interest, Himawari, and his rival Doumeki are at this stage less fully realized but there is future potential for growth.Anyone who is not already an anime fan, I would urge to approach this series after shaking off all your western ideas about what ""cartoons"" are or you will miss much of this lushly realized story.",4,"Multilayered Urban Fantasy or Hey, This Series Is Really Good",1208304000,"04 16, 2008",2008,1967,"['think', ""'m"", 'hooked', 'first', 'scenes', 'first', 'episode', 'when', 'hero', '19', 'year', 'old', 'school', 'boy', 'Watanuki', 'walking', 'along', 'cityscape', 'where', 'other', 'human', 'figures', 'are', 'rendered', 'gray', 'blocky', 'style', 'was', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'magic', 'learning.The', 'x', 'title', 'not', 'mean', 'anything', 'do', 'porn', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'simple', 'level', 'would', 'appeal', 'probably', 'age', '10', 'up', 'amusing', 'innuendo', 'beginning', '3rd', 'episode', 'very', 'brief', 'innocuous', 'more', 'viewer', 'willing', 'give', 'series', 'more', 'multilayered', 'rich', 'story', 'arc', 'moved', 'along', 'Watanuki', 'meeting', 'various', 'individuals', 'whom', 'have', 'affect', 'character', 'development', 'beginning', 'Yuko', 'beautiful', 'witch', 'who', 'wish', 'shop', 'times', 'mischievous', 'demanding', 'other', 'times', 'wise', 'sage-like', 'Yuko', 'bargains', 'tricks', 'Watanuki', 'becoming', 'parttime', 'employee', 'very', 'good', 'cook', 'grumblings', 'temper', 'often', 'overlook', 'potential', 'culinary', 'disasters', 'too', 'late', 'rashly', 'times', 'well', 'intended', 'crush', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'school', 'engaged', 'rivalry', 'schoolmate', 'Doumeki', 'polar', 'opposite', 'personality.Watanuki', 'fully', 'realized', 'character', 'volatility', 'age', 'appropriate', 'as', 'well', 'problems', 'working', 'evil', 'spirits', 'are', 'attracted', 'early', 'loss', 'parental', 'figures', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'irritating', 'rather', 'amusing', 'sweet', 'obvious', 'good', 'qualities', 'even', 'lose', 'temper', 'easily', 'love', 'interest', 'Himawari', 'rival', 'Doumeki', 'are', 'stage', 'less', 'fully', 'realized', 'future', 'potential', 'growth.Anyone', 'who', 'not', 'already', 'anime', 'fan', 'would', 'urge', 'approach', 'series', 'shaking', 'off', 'western', 'ideas', 'what', 'cartoons', 'are', 'will', 'miss', 'much', 'lushly', 'realized', 'story']",xxxHOLiC: First Collection
