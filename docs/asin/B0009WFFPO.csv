The variety of each segment is great, you won't get bored with the routines buts it certainly isn't very challenging. I did the entire workout without ever breaking a sweat. For a more challenging circuit workout try Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred, it is a grueling 20 minutes that goes by fast but you will feel it.",3,"nice variety, but not very challenging",1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2009,421,"['was', 'excited', 'get', 'dvd', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'powerhouse', 'workout', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'variety', 'segment', 'great', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'routines', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'very', 'challenging', 'did', 'entire', 'workout', 'ever', 'breaking', 'sweat', 'more', 'challenging', 'circuit', 'try', 'Jillian', 'Michael', '30', 'Day', 'Shred', 'grueling', '20', 'minutes', 'fast', 'will', 'feel']",Prevention Fitness Systems: 3-2-1 Workout
914655,A127IROWZNM255,B0009WFFPO,Rebecca E. Ratliff,"[1, 1]","Although I do not find myself using this video very often, I'm still giving it four stars because I believe that beginners could benefit from it.  I exercise regularly and am already in good shape, so I didn't feel that it gave me as good of a workout as I wanted.  That being said here are the good things about this DVD.Circuit training is great because you don't get bored.  There are six circuits and each one focuses on a different muscle group for the strength-training section of the circuit, and you also get a different style of cardio each time.  But, as mentioned before, I'd really only recommend this to beginners because the cardio is so short that you really don't have a chance to get your heart rate up.  Also, if you're the type who doesn't really look forward to excersising this workout seems to go by very fast, probably due to the circuits.  The production is good, and the instructor gives decent instruction.  The only real problem I have with this video is that, to me, Chris Freytag is pretty annoying.  One of those overly-perky, ""Come on!  You can do it!  Don't stop now!  Keep going!!"" types.  But a lot of people who've written reviews haven't seemed to mind that, so perhaps it's just me.",4,Good circuit workout for beginners,1236729600,"03 11, 2009",2009,1219,"['do', 'not', 'find', 'using', 'video', 'very', 'often', ""'m"", 'still', 'giving', 'four', 'stars', 'believe', 'beginners', 'could', 'benefit', 'exercise', 'regularly', 'am', 'already', 'good', 'shape', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'gave', 'good', 'workout', 'wanted', 'being', 'said', 'here', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'DVD.Circuit', 'training', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'are', 'six', 'circuits', 'one', 'different', 'muscle', 'group', 'strength-training', 'section', 'circuit', 'also', 'get', 'different', 'style', 'cardio', 'time', 'mentioned', ""'d"", 'really', 'only', 'recommend', 'beginners', 'cardio', 'so', 'short', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'Also', ""'re"", 'type', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', 'forward', 'excersising', 'workout', 'go', 'very', 'fast', 'probably', 'due', 'circuits', 'production', 'good', 'instructor', 'decent', 'instruction', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'have', 'video', 'Chris', 'Freytag', 'pretty', 'annoying', 'One', 'overly-perky', 'Come', 'can', 'do', 'Do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'now', 'Keep', 'going', 'types', 'lot', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'written', 'reviews', 'have', ""n't"", 'seemed', 'mind', 'so', 'perhaps', 'just']",Prevention Fitness Systems: 3-2-1 Workout
