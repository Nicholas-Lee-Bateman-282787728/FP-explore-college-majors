She goes through nearly psychotic methods and tactics to sabotage peoples lives and along the way seems to want to aim to be Don's (the doctor she's enamoured with)lover! Very funny and twisted and just a little bit dark. It pokes fun at alot of conventions and plops Jill (the star) smack right into the middle of it right along with her neuroses and nearly psychotic issues. Very funny!

Julia Davis wrote and starred in the series, playing monstrous Jill Tyrell, a self-centered egomaniac who discovers her long-suffering husband Terry (Kevin Eldon) has cancer.  Despite Terry's quite hopeful prognosis, the first thing Jill does is sign up with a dating agency, then places Terry in a nursing home and tells everyone he has died...before setting her sights on her handsome new doctor neighbour Don (Angus Deayton).  Jill's only obstacle lies with Cathy (Rebecca Front), Don's wheelchair-bound wife.  Using every cunning trick and insult at her disposal, Jill will stop at nothing to claim Don for herself.Julia Davis is fabulous playing Jill, a character with absolutely NO redeeming qualities.

Nighty Night is NO English Curb Your Enthusiasm. Larry David at least had an ounce of humanity. He was selfish, egotistical, manipulative but he was also capable of altruism and kindness. Curb's humor is based not just on Larry's selfish and manipulative behavior but on a series of misunderstandings and miscommunications. Nighty Night is Jill as a conniving, vile, underhanded, manipulative little sociopath with no redeeming qualities in a human being whatsoever.Nighty Night tries to find humor in issues like cancer and MS, but on issues like this it has to be handled with a lot of sensitivity and care. It came across as heartless and mean spirited. The  premise of the show is Jill's husband Terry has cancer and is to undergo treatment in the hospital. The following day, she goes to a dating agency to be hooked up on a blind date. Her neighbor Cathy, who is suffering from MS has a husband Don, a doctor who has been unfaithful to his wife in the past. Jill does everything in her womanly powers to try to seduce him. It reeks of, ""Hey, this is a dark comedy of a egotistical, self obsessed woman who is willing to break down doors of common decency and stab people in the back in order to get her own selfish way! Isn't this funny?"" No, it isn't. It's not a dark comedy, it's just vile. About the only funny scene is when Cathy has had enough of Jill's stupid shenanigans and punches her in the eye.The humor is bloody terrible. For instance, in episode three Jill makes an obvious attempt to come onto Don by wearing her bare underwear and is jiggling up and down in front of him as he's about to go to work. He ignores her and goes to work. Despite her numerous attempts to come onto him, Don doesn't notice Jill's not-so-subtle hints. If there was an award handed out to ""Most Oblivious Man of the Year Award,"" Don would be the frontrunner by miles. Or another painfully unfunny scene is at her husband's ""fake"" funeral. The problem is Terry isn't dead, he was cured of his cancer but it doesn't stop her as she tells everybody her husband is dead and gives out funeral invitations. She rides on a horse to the church and when she finally reaches the altar she does a little dance number to The Pretenders ""I'll stand by You"" with her beautician assistant Linda.

This happens to be the first scene of the first episode, and it's the last rational reaction you'll see for the next three hours. Jill, not one to rest on her laurels, decides a new man is the order of the day, and, before Terry is even ill, much less dead, deposits him in the hospital and heads off to find a man. Enter the unlucky Don (Angus Deayton), and his multiple sclerosis-afflicted wife Cathy (Rebecca Front), as Jill's new neighbours. Deciding that he's the man for her, and blindly ignoring the fact that Terry doesn't seem to be getting any sicker, Jill goes about driving a wedge between Don and Cathy, and keeping Terry's presence a secret from all and sundry.As with ""The League of Gentlemen"", ""Nighty Night"" is a comedy that gets laughs from its situational absurdity. The main characters, with the exception of Jill, are portrayed beautifully as normal, rational people cast headlong into an unreasonable situation, but, thanks to the machinations of the ensemble of secondary characters (such as the gloriously funny Ruth Jones as Jill's long-suffering employee and friend Linda, and the wickedly irreverent Mark Gatiss as her erstwhile paramour Glenn Bulb), they soon find themselves descending to a level of abnormality that they're clearly not comfortable with. Happily, this makes for the best viewing, and ""Nighty Night"" is one of the best comedies to come out of Britain in recent years.Julia Davis as Jill is monstrously cruel, totally self-centred and completely sociopathic, but, as with all good anti-heroes, she manages to generate such sympathy for the character that we are rooting for her to win, in the end. It's a brilliant portrayal of a character, that, in the hands of a lesser actress or with less care taken over the finer points of the script, could easily have sunk into one-dimensional nastiness. Happily, Davis has created in Jill Tyrell a sitcom heroine to rival - and beat - the likes of Basil Fawlty, Patsy Stone and Vicki Pollard at their own game.I'm not going to give anything away, so I'm going to end my review here, suffice it so say that here are three of the best and funniest hours you could ever own on DVD. Extras - outtakes and almost twenty minutes of deleted scenes - are wonderful, and the audio/video quality is, as one would expect from the BBC, top-drawer.Wholeheartedly recommended as an essential purchase.",5,"Incredible Comedy, truly original and very dark.",1134345600,"12 12, 2005",2005,2779,"['so', 'often', 'sitcom', 'very', 'long', 'time', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Nighty', 'Night', 'BBC', 'most', 'recent', 'sitcom-to-DVD', 'conversion', 'just', 'such', 'thing.Jill', 'Tyrell', 'Julia', 'Davis', 'show', 'writer', 'creator', 'fabulous', 'comedy', 'actress', 'boot', 'beautician', 'nondescript', 'Northern', 'town', 'devastated', 'learn', 'husband', 'Terry', 'Kevin', 'Eldon', 'cancer', 'be', 'first', 'scene', 'first', 'episode', 'last', 'rational', 'reaction', ""'ll"", 'see', 'next', 'three', 'hours', 'Jill', 'not', 'one', 'rest', 'laurels', 'new', 'man', 'order', 'day', 'Terry', 'even', 'ill', 'much', 'less', 'dead', 'hospital', 'heads', 'find', 'man', 'Enter', 'unlucky', 'Don', 'Angus', 'Deayton', 'multiple', 'sclerosis-afflicted', 'wife', 'Cathy', 'Rebecca', 'Front', 'Jill', 'new', 'neighbours', 'Deciding', 'man', 'blindly', 'ignoring', 'fact', 'Terry', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'getting', 'sicker', 'Jill', 'driving', 'wedge', 'Don', 'Cathy', 'keeping', 'Terry', 'presence', 'secret', 'sundry.As', 'League', 'Gentlemen', 'Nighty', 'Night', 'comedy', 'situational', 'absurdity', 'main', 'characters', 'exception', 'Jill', 'are', 'portrayed', 'beautifully', 'normal', 'rational', 'people', 'cast', 'headlong', 'unreasonable', 'situation', 'thanks', 'machinations', 'ensemble', 'secondary', 'characters', 'such', 'gloriously', 'funny', 'Ruth', 'Jones', 'Jill', 'long-suffering', 'employee', 'friend', 'Linda', 'wickedly', 'irreverent', 'Mark', 'Gatiss', 'erstwhile', 'paramour', 'Glenn', 'Bulb', 'soon', 'find', 'descending', 'level', 'abnormality', ""'re"", 'clearly', 'not', 'comfortable', 'Happily', 'best', 'viewing', 'Nighty', 'Night', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'come', 'Britain', 'recent', 'years.Julia', 'Davis', 'Jill', 'monstrously', 'cruel', 'totally', 'self-centred', 'completely', 'sociopathic', 'good', 'anti-heroes', 'generate', 'such', 'sympathy', 'character', 'are', 'rooting', 'win', 'end', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'character', 'hands', 'lesser', 'actress', 'less', 'care', 'taken', 'finer', 'points', 'script', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'sunk', 'one-dimensional', 'nastiness', 'Happily', 'Davis', 'created', 'Jill', 'Tyrell', 'sitcom', 'heroine', 'rival', 'beat', 'likes', 'Basil', 'Fawlty', 'Patsy', 'Stone', 'Vicki', 'Pollard', 'own', 'game.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'give', 'anything', 'away', ""'m"", 'going', 'end', 'review', 'here', 'suffice', 'so', 'say', 'here', 'are', 'three', 'best', 'funniest', 'hours', 'could', 'ever', 'own', 'DVD', 'Extras', 'outtakes', 'almost', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'audio/video', 'quality', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'BBC', 'top-drawer.Wholeheartedly', 'recommended', 'essential', 'purchase']",Nighty Night - The Complete Series 1

950749,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B000BVM1SM,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[1, 6]","I'm a big George Michael fan and he mentioned liking this series when interviewed after getting out of hospital post-pnemonia (sp?), so I checked it out from the library to have a look.  All the actresses/actors were good; I give it one star because the lead character ran so roughshod over everyone around her and no one checked her, which I found unbelievable.  Yes she owned her own salon so I can understand her employees having to put up with her, and yes I can accept that she chose a husband she could walk all over, but every single other character she interacted with took her guff, in as many episodes as I could stand to watch (couldn't get through all of them), with very little to no complaint.  Even her customers were abused.  What successful small business owner would be such a dolt that she would run roughshod over her own customers; how could she stay in business.  Obviously she couldn't.  And she lived in a small village, not London, so word of mouth about her would quickly get around town, and she'd have no customers and therefore no business.  I understand that in real life, often out of politeness, people will not contradict an overbearing stranger, but the lead treated every single other character abominably and she got away with it every time (again wasn't interested enough in her to watch all the episodes). As the lead character isn't rich, famous or especially beautiful (not a knock at the lead, who is attractive, just obvious she isn't playing a high-end star) in the story, no reason for anyone but her employees, and possibly her husband, to put up with her.  One star due to unbelievable character interactions.  Lead actress was good, I thought she had a good time with the part.  If characters behave unbelievably in a story, how is the audience supposed to care about them.  The lead character was believable as a self-obsessed bully, but the surrounding characters were not believable in the way they reacted to her (except, as previously noted, her employees/husband).  Poorly written secondary characters.  Plus lead character was one note, didn't flush her out.  She started out obnoxious and stayed that way throughout (witnessed same behavior in final episode).  Most people in the audience don't know how a beauty salon is run, but every single person is an expert on human behavior/interaction (because we've been interacting with others since birth) and when an especially unbelievable character interaction is featured in a story, it makes it harder for audience to suspend disbelief, I think is the literary phrase.  Ugh, is my phrase.  As a woman, I want more roles featuring women, but if characters don't interact in a recognizable (i.e., human) way, then a story/series featuring a woman is unengaging.  I want more women's roles, but in quality, well-written projects.  I understand the lead actress wrote this, and it's been off awhile now, so she's probably gotten better.  I look forward to seeing more of her work and seeing her progression/improvement.  She's obviously talented; she can write a lead who gets the audience's attention, just needs to create a fictitious world in which her lead ""lives.""",1,didn't care for it...(SPOILERS),1370217600,"06 3, 2013",2013,3170,"[""'m"", 'big', 'George', 'Michael', 'fan', 'mentioned', 'liking', 'series', 'when', 'interviewed', 'getting', 'hospital', 'post-pnemonia', 'sp', 'so', 'checked', 'out', 'library', 'have', 'look', 'actresses/actors', 'were', 'good', 'give', 'one', 'star', 'lead', 'character', 'ran', 'so', 'roughshod', 'everyone', 'one', 'checked', 'found', 'unbelievable', 'Yes', 'owned', 'own', 'salon', 'can', 'understand', 'employees', 'having', 'put', 'up', 'yes', 'can', 'accept', 'chose', 'husband', 'could', 'walk', 'single', 'other', 'character', 'interacted', 'took', 'guff', 'as', 'many', 'episodes', 'could', 'stand', 'watch', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'very', 'little', 'complaint', 'Even', 'customers', 'were', 'abused', 'What', 'successful', 'small', 'business', 'owner', 'would', 'be', 'such', 'dolt', 'would', 'run', 'roughshod', 'own', 'customers', 'how', 'could', 'stay', 'business', 'Obviously', 'could', ""n't"", 'lived', 'small', 'village', 'not', 'London', 'word', 'mouth', 'would', 'quickly', 'get', 'town', ""'d"", 'have', 'customers', 'therefore', 'business', 'understand', 'real', 'life', 'often', 'politeness', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'contradict', 'overbearing', 'stranger', 'lead', 'treated', 'single', 'other', 'character', 'abominably', 'got', 'away', 'time', 'again', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', 'enough', 'watch', 'episodes', 'lead', 'character', ""n't"", 'rich', 'famous', 'especially', 'beautiful', 'not', 'knock', 'lead', 'who', 'attractive', 'just', 'obvious', ""n't"", 'playing', 'high-end', 'star', 'story', 'reason', 'anyone', 'employees', 'possibly', 'husband', 'put', 'up', 'One', 'star', 'due', 'unbelievable', 'character', 'interactions', 'Lead', 'actress', 'was', 'good', 'thought', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'part', 'characters', 'behave', 'unbelievably', 'story', 'how', 'audience', 'supposed', 'care', 'lead', 'character', 'was', 'believable', 'self-obsessed', 'bully', 'surrounding', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'believable', 'way', 'reacted', 'except', 'previously', 'noted', 'employees/husband', 'Poorly', 'written', 'secondary', 'characters', 'lead', 'character', 'was', 'one', 'note', 'did', ""n't"", 'flush', 'out', 'started', 'out', 'obnoxious', 'stayed', 'way', 'witnessed', 'same', 'behavior', 'final', 'episode', 'Most', 'people', 'audience', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'beauty', 'salon', 'run', 'single', 'person', 'expert', 'human', 'behavior/interaction', ""'ve"", 'been', 'interacting', 'others', 'birth', 'when', 'especially', 'unbelievable', 'character', 'interaction', 'featured', 'story', 'harder', 'audience', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'think', 'literary', 'phrase', 'Ugh', 'phrase', 'woman', 'want', 'more', 'roles', 'featuring', 'women', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'interact', 'recognizable', 'i.e.', 'human', 'way', 'then', 'story/series', 'featuring', 'woman', 'unengaging', 'want', 'more', 'women', 'roles', 'quality', 'well-written', 'projects', 'understand', 'lead', 'actress', 'wrote', 'been', 'off', 'awhile', 'now', 'probably', 'gotten', 'better', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'work', 'seeing', 'progression/improvement', 'obviously', 'talented', 'can', 'write', 'lead', 'who', 'audience', 'attention', 'just', 'create', 'fictitious', 'world', 'lead']",Nighty Night - The Complete Series 1
