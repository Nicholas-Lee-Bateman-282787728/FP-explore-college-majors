Eliza Dushku does a great job as Tru Davies, med school graduate working in a morgue because she can't get into a hospital intern program (did I get that last part right?).I never had a problem with the former ""Faith"" actress in he new role or in the general plotline (Tru's brother Harrison is sort of believable as is her coke snorting older sister but neither is really likeable).Things starting going downhill for me when Jason Priestly's character was introduced, the guy did all right in the role but it just makes me think the producers were desparate to improve ratings by going off on a new storyline. I liked the development that Tru's mother also had the calling, didn't quite mind the implication, later strengthened, that her father had Mom killed- it's just that the story smacks of an attempt to improve ratings that probably won't result in a full second season.I think I'll wait and see if the price goes down before I decide on buying myself a copy.",4,"First part of the season was great, 2nd season won't last",1097971200,"10 17, 2004",2004,1041,"['never', 'missed', 'episode', 'First', 'season', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'great', 'job', 'Tru', 'Davies', 'med', 'school', 'graduate', 'working', 'morgue', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'hospital', 'intern', 'program', 'did', 'get', 'last', 'part', 'right', '.I', 'never', 'had', 'problem', 'former', 'Faith', 'actress', 'new', 'role', 'general', 'plotline', 'Tru', 'brother', 'Harrison', 'sort', 'believable', 'coke', 'snorting', 'older', 'sister', 'really', 'likeable', '.Things', 'starting', 'going', 'downhill', 'when', 'Jason', 'Priestly', 'character', 'was', 'introduced', 'guy', 'did', 'right', 'role', 'just', 'think', 'producers', 'were', 'desparate', 'improve', 'ratings', 'going', 'off', 'new', 'storyline', 'liked', 'development', 'Tru', 'mother', 'also', 'had', 'calling', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'mind', 'implication', 'later', 'strengthened', 'father', 'had', 'Mom', 'killed-', 'just', 'story', 'smacks', 'attempt', 'improve', 'ratings', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'result', 'full', 'second', 'season.I', 'think', ""'ll"", 'wait', 'see', 'price', 'decide', 'buying', 'copy']",N/A
849518,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0002XVKMM,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[12, 13]","I am a huge Buffy/Angel fan.  So much so that when I found out that Eliza Dushku, who wonderfully played the popular character of Faith the Vampire Slayer, had decided to do a show called Tru Calling instead of a Faith-based spin-off of Buffy, I was understandibly ticked off by the idea.  Why should she waste her talent on a show that looked kind of dumb when she could do a show that already had a fan base and would be helmed by Joss Whedon, one of television's greatest assets?  After watching the show on TV, and then again in this boxed set, I have come to terms with Ms. Dushku's decision, and I've found a great little show in the process.Dushku plays Tru Davies, a recent college graduate with hopes of going to medical school (although with her intelligence, she's pretty much a shoo-in).  She planned on interning at a hospital in order to help on her application, but when the funding for it fell through, she was referred to taking a job at the City Morgue.  There, she meets her boss Davis (Zach Galifianakis), a very quirky, yet friendly, man who is more comfortable with the dead than he is with the living.  However, Tru gets a little more than she bargained for when, on her first night on the job (she has the graveyard shift), a cadaver turns to her and asks her for help.  The day ""rewinds"", and Tru finds herself back at the beginning of the previous day, although now she retains all knowlege of what will happen.  Using her knowledge of things to come along with her intellect, she is able to prevent the person from dying.As I said earlier, when I first heard this premise, I thought it sounded a little cheesy.  Not only that, but it doesn't exactly make this show original; it mainly has elements of Early Edition and Groundhog's Day to it, with some inspiration drawn from The Sixth Sense, Quantom Leap, and sometimes even Buffy.  However, that may not be such a bad thing.  Tru Calling takes many of the best aspects of these shows/movies, and combines them into a very entertaining hour of television.Another problem I thought the show might have would be that, after a few weeks, the formula would get old.  Wrong.  Even though each episode has pretty much the same general formula (body asks for Tru's help, Tru rewinds and tries to help the person before they die), the writers are able to keep things fresh by adding new twists, interesting backstory for some of the characters, and even the risk of failure (notice how I said she TRIES to help the person).Furthermore, the dead aren't the only people in need of help.  Tru's sister Meredith (Jessica Collins) is a well-to-do lawyer who is addicted to cocaine and refuses to admit it.  Her brother Harrison (played very well by Shawn Reeves) is a compulsive gambler who never knows when to quit, and is always asking for fiscal help from his siblings.  Tru's best friend Lindsay (A.J. Cook) usually needs Tru's help with relationship issues, and Tru's father Richard (Cotter Smith) is very distant with his kids ever since the tragic death of his wife Elise (who was murdered in front of Tru 10 years prior).  Throughout her rewind days, Tru is able to help her friends and family in little ways while helping total strangers live to see the next day.For the most part, the actors were very good in their roles.  Dushku, who I think turned down the Faith show to avoid being typecast as the ""bad girl"", is very good as the smart and heroic Tru.  Reeves and Galifianakis are great in their respective roles.  They each have very distinctive personalities, and are very funny to watch in their interactions with other people.  Jason Priestly, who joins the cast towards the end of the season, plays Jack Harper, a man with a few secrets of his own, and he plays Harper extremely well.  He is obnoxious yet cool at the same time.Sadly, this show didn't pick up too much of an audience.  For the most part, critics did not like the show, and it was up against shows such as Friends and CSI, however it does have a very loyal fanbase.  So for a show that was so unpopular, it got a very strong DVD treatment.  There are plenty of extras, such as deleted scenes, featurettes, and many commentaries on key episodes.Some of the best episodes include ""Putting Out Fires"", ""Brother's Keeper"", ""Murder in the Morgue"", ""Star-Crossed"", ""The Longest Day"" (a very Groundhog's Day episode that aired 3 days after the actual Groundhog's Day of '04), ""Valentine"", ""Daddy's Girl"", ""The Getaway"", ""Two Pair"", ""Rear Window"", ""D.O.A."", and the season finale ""Two Weddings and a Funeral"".  I would reccomend at least renting this set if you are a fan of fantasy shows (it's definitely an acquired taste, which may be one reason why ratings were low).  It really is a good show if you give it a chance.",5,Truly Great; If Only It Could Find An Audience,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,4763,"['am', 'huge', 'Buffy/Angel', 'fan', 'So', 'much', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'who', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'popular', 'character', 'Faith', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'had', 'decided', 'do', 'show', 'called', 'Tru', 'Calling', 'instead', 'Faith-based', 'spin-off', 'Buffy', 'was', 'understandibly', 'ticked', 'off', 'idea', 'Why', 'should', 'waste', 'talent', 'show', 'looked', 'kind', 'dumb', 'when', 'could', 'do', 'show', 'already', 'had', 'fan', 'base', 'would', 'be', 'helmed', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'one', 'television', 'greatest', 'assets', 'watching', 'show', 'TV', 'then', 'again', 'boxed', 'set', 'have', 'come', 'terms', 'Ms.', 'Dushku', 'decision', ""'ve"", 'found', 'great', 'little', 'show', 'process.Dushku', 'Tru', 'Davies', 'recent', 'college', 'graduate', 'hopes', 'going', 'medical', 'school', 'intelligence', 'pretty', 'much', 'shoo-in', 'planned', 'interning', 'hospital', 'order', 'help', 'application', 'when', 'funding', 'fell', 'was', 'referred', 'taking', 'job', 'City', 'Morgue', 'boss', 'Davis', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'very', 'quirky', 'yet', 'friendly', 'man', 'who', 'more', 'comfortable', 'dead', 'living', 'However', 'Tru', 'little', 'more', 'bargained', 'when', 'first', 'night', 'job', 'graveyard', 'shift', 'cadaver', 'help', 'day', 'rewinds', 'Tru', 'back', 'beginning', 'previous', 'day', 'now', 'knowlege', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Using', 'knowledge', 'things', 'come', 'along', 'intellect', 'able', 'prevent', 'person', 'dying.As', 'said', 'earlier', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'premise', 'thought', 'sounded', 'little', 'cheesy', 'Not', 'only', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'make', 'show', 'original', 'mainly', 'elements', 'Early', 'Edition', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'inspiration', 'drawn', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Quantom', 'Leap', 'sometimes', 'even', 'Buffy', 'However', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'such', 'bad', 'thing', 'Tru', 'Calling', 'many', 'best', 'aspects', 'shows/movies', 'combines', 'very', 'entertaining', 'hour', 'television.Another', 'problem', 'thought', 'show', 'might', 'have', 'would', 'be', 'few', 'weeks', 'formula', 'would', 'get', 'old', 'Wrong', 'Even', 'episode', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'general', 'formula', 'body', 'Tru', 'help', 'Tru', 'help', 'person', 'die', 'writers', 'are', 'able', 'keep', 'things', 'fresh', 'adding', 'new', 'twists', 'interesting', 'backstory', 'characters', 'even', 'risk', 'failure', 'notice', 'how', 'said', 'TRIES', 'help', 'person', '.Furthermore', 'dead', 'are', ""n't"", 'only', 'people', 'need', 'help', 'Tru', 'sister', 'Meredith', 'Jessica', 'Collins', 'well-to-do', 'lawyer', 'who', 'addicted', 'cocaine', 'admit', 'brother', 'Harrison', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Shawn', 'Reeves', 'compulsive', 'gambler', 'who', 'never', 'when', 'quit', 'always', 'asking', 'fiscal', 'help', 'siblings', 'Tru', 'best', 'friend', 'Lindsay', 'A.J', 'Cook', 'usually', 'Tru', 'help', 'relationship', 'issues', 'Tru', 'father', 'Richard', 'Cotter', 'Smith', 'very', 'distant', 'kids', 'ever', 'tragic', 'death', 'wife', 'Elise', 'who', 'was', 'murdered', 'front', 'Tru', '10', 'years', 'prior', 'rewind', 'days', 'Tru', 'able', 'help', 'friends', 'family', 'little', 'ways', 'helping', 'total', 'strangers', 'live', 'see', 'next', 'day.For', 'most', 'part', 'actors', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'roles', 'Dushku', 'who', 'think', 'turned', 'down', 'Faith', 'show', 'avoid', 'being', 'typecast', 'bad', 'girl', 'very', 'good', 'smart', 'heroic', 'Tru', 'Reeves', 'Galifianakis', 'are', 'great', 'respective', 'roles', 'have', 'very', 'distinctive', 'personalities', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'watch', 'interactions', 'other', 'people', 'Jason', 'Priestly', 'who', 'cast', 'end', 'season', 'Jack', 'Harper', 'man', 'few', 'secrets', 'own', 'Harper', 'extremely', 'well', 'obnoxious', 'yet', 'cool', 'same', 'time.Sadly', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'audience', 'most', 'part', 'critics', 'did', 'not', 'show', 'was', 'up', 'shows', 'such', 'Friends', 'CSI', 'however', 'have', 'very', 'loyal', 'fanbase', 'So', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'unpopular', 'got', 'very', 'strong', 'DVD', 'treatment', 'are', 'plenty', 'extras', 'such', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'featurettes', 'many', 'commentaries', 'key', 'episodes.Some', 'best', 'episodes', 'include', 'Putting', 'Out', 'Fires', 'Brother', 'Keeper', 'Murder', 'Morgue', 'Star-Crossed', 'Longest', 'Day', 'very', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'episode', 'aired', '3', 'days', 'actual', 'Groundhog', 'Day', ""'04"", 'Valentine', 'Daddy', 'Girl', 'Getaway', 'Two', 'Pair', 'Rear', 'Window', 'D.O.A', 'season', 'finale', 'Two', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'would', 'reccomend', 'least', 'renting', 'set', 'are', 'fan', 'fantasy', 'shows', 'definitely', 'acquired', 'taste', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'ratings', 'were', 'low', 'really', 'good', 'show', 'give', 'chance']",N/A

It was no wonder that it didn't get good ratings, but it did pretty well considering it's competition. Here's my review of the season and be sure to watch for easter eggs on the final disc and maybe others.Pilot- After Tru finds out that she wasn't going to get work at a hospital, or more accurately: medical school, she's transferred to the morgue where on her first day there, she gets asked for help from a girl in serious trouble.Putting Out Fires- Tru falls in love with a fireman who asks for her help when he saves a boy from a house someone set on fire and of course, he dies in the fire but rescues the boy.Brother's Keeper- Harrison is arrested for the murder of his girlfriend's husband, who won't get a divorce because he is rich and she would get way more value if they did. After the husband asks for Tru's help, Tru gets to find out everything except something Davis is hiding.Past Tense- Five guys are living in the past when they all show up at the morgue and ask for her help. Now she attends the party, intending to save them when a sixth guy enters.Haunted- Crazy college kids try killing themselves then re-awakening after about 10 seconds of going under, only one of the girls heart fails so Tru is forced to help. And Davis finally reveals his secret to Tru: he knows she relives days.Star-Crossed- Two high-school kids die after a jealous brother runs them off a ledge. Now the only question is, why?Morning After- Tru is forced to save her ex-boyfriend when he comes begging for her to take him back. She fears that she may have killed him as all the evidence leads that way.Closure- A beautiful tale of a soldier dying of a decease and tries to see his ex-girlfriend because he loved her so much and the only reason they broke up was because of the war.Murder in the Morgue- Tru finally convinces Harrison that she relives days. And while she tries to save the life of a bride who asked for help, she also has to save Davis and herself from dying after the supposable killer arrives at the morgue and tampers with the evidence.Reunion- Tru's high school class is reunited and her old friend, who stole her boyfriend in high school, is murdered and asks for Tru's help.The Longest Day- Geese, I'm glad I'm not her when it comes to days like these. It gets repeated 4 times as each time, someone different dies. Then she realizes that maybe someone is supposed to die but she's not doing something right.Valentine- While Tru and Harrison try to find a way from revealing Tru's secret to Lindsey and Luc, a serial killer is on the loose at the cottage they've rented out. And Luc breaks up with Tru.Drop Dead Gorgeous- Clare Kramer(""Buffy's"" Glory) makes a guest appearence, someone accidentally murders one of the beauty pageants who was actually targetting Clare's character. Tru is forced to help her while a reporter is starting to bug her about the amount of times she shows up and saves people and Davis reveals that her mother also relived days.Daddy's Girl- Tru meets the man that her father paid to have her mother killed. And she is forced to save her father's girlfriend after she gets shot. Jason Priestley joins the cast as Jack Harper who tries out on the first day but his references didn't check out but after the day restarted, he was able to get the job on the spot.The Getaway- Tru is unsure whether she should save the life of the reporter whose been bugging her. Cause it may reveal her ability.Two Pair- As Tru starts wondering about Jack, thinking there's more to him then he leads on, two bodies ask for her help but she only saves one of them as the other one commits suicide after a phone call to her parents reveals how she lost all her tuition money and all the evidence of who made the call points to Jack. And Davis reveals to Tru how he knew she relived days.Death Becomes Her- Tamyra Gray fakes her own death to disappear from the media because of her baby. Jack starts questioning about Tru never being on a pick-up.Rear Window- Now Tru gets to ask questions about Jack as Davis shows up wanting to talk to her but the day restarts before he says anything. As the day goes on, he invetually discovers what it was and feels something is very wrong when he finds out that Jack was in a mental institute because he thought he relived days.D.O.A.- Things seem all to good for Tru as her and Jack seem to be doing good and getting along. Well, until Jack purposely messes up a street direction so that the person dies and then later tries to stop her from saving someone else's life. It seems that while Tru relives days to save the lives of people that have recently passed away, Jack relives those days to make sure they stay dead.Two Weddings and a Funeral- As Tru and Jack are now at war over whether she should save the lives of people that are supposed to die. Harrison becomes the next target for Jack as he passes away and asks for her help. Tru manages to save his life on day two, Jack notices and does something indescribeable to make sure that someone dies in his place. This causes a war between the two of them and Jack reveals that her father used to relive days the same way Jack does now.Also includes Deleted Scenes, selected commentary of three episodes from some of the actors, the music video for the theme song, and featurettes:""Finding the Calling: The Pilot""""The Tru Path: Season One""And ""Evil Comes Calling: A late Season Twist""And as for Jack, I don't think that he was necessarily a villain. I think Tru was a hero but Jack was definitely mis-understood, at least by Tru and her gang. He had a different opinion and I think, for the most part, he was right.

After Buffy went off the air there was much speculation that Eliza Dushku would reprise her Faith character and star in her own spin-off show. That didn't happen. Instead, she starred in an original program called Tru Calling that, on the surface, seemed to stray from her genre roots but as became apparent as the season progressed, had more than a few toes in the waters of the fantastical.Many episodes include deleted scenes with optional commentary by series creator/executive producer Jon Harmon Feldman. The first disc contains an audio commentary on the Pilot episode by Feldman, executive producer Dawn Prouse and actors Eliza Dushku and Shawn Reaves. This is a bland track as Feldman mostly points out what we are watching and the commentators joke with each other.The second disc features an audio commentary by Feldman on ""Star-Crossed.""The commentary tracks pick up somewhat on the third disc for the episode, ""The Longest Day."" Everyone from the first disc commentary is back but with actually something to say.The strongest commentary track appears on disc four with ""Daddy's Girl"" as Feldman and Dushku are joined by Zach Galifianakis who brings a much needed wry sense of humour to the proceedings. He takes every opportunity to playfully make fun of Dushku. This is a very entertaining track.The fifth disc features a commentary on ""Two Pair"" with Feldman and Jason Priestley. They engage in quite a good conversation about the mythology of the show and how Priestley's character shed more light on Tru's powers.The final disc contains the bulk of the extra material with an audio commentary on the season finale with Feldman, Dushku and Galifianakis.There is also a featurette entitled, ""Finding the Calling: The Pilot,"" which looks at the making of this episode. The cast talk about their characters in usual electronic press kit format-soundbites mixed with clips from the show.""The Tru Path: Season One"" is an overview of the show. Dushku mentions that the first half of the season tested out what did and didn't work in terms of material and characterization.The show clearly hit its stride with the arrival of Jason Priestley and this is explored in a featurette entitled, ""Evil Comes Calling: A Late Season Twist."" The show's creators cast Priestley against type and he talks about what drew him to the show.Finally, there is a music video for the show's theme song, ""Somebody Help Me"" by Full Blown Rose.Tru Calling suffered early on from growing pains but those with patience will be rewarded as the season progresses and the show became surer of itself. Once it settled into the fascinating mythology of Tru's powers and the role Jack Harper plays in her life, Tru Calling really started to get good. Sadly, rumours are flying that the show has been cancelled despite shooting six episodes of the second season. Hopefully, Fox will let them see the light of day on DVD.",4,A gem in the rough,1101945600,"12 2, 2004",2004,3016,"['demise', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Angel', 'fans', 'two', 'franchises', 'have', 'been', 'jonesin', 'fix', 'Buffy', 'went', 'air', 'was', 'much', 'speculation', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'would', 'reprise', 'Faith', 'character', 'star', 'own', 'spin-off', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Instead', 'starred', 'original', 'program', 'called', 'Tru', 'Calling', 'surface', 'seemed', 'stray', 'genre', 'roots', 'became', 'apparent', 'season', 'progressed', 'had', 'more', 'few', 'toes', 'waters', 'fantastical.Many', 'episodes', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'optional', 'commentary', 'series', 'creator/executive', 'producer', 'Jon', 'Harmon', 'Feldman', 'first', 'disc', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'Feldman', 'executive', 'producer', 'Dawn', 'Prouse', 'actors', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'Shawn', 'Reaves', 'bland', 'track', 'Feldman', 'mostly', 'out', 'what', 'are', 'watching', 'commentators', 'joke', 'other.The', 'second', 'disc', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Feldman', 'Star-Crossed', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'pick', 'up', 'somewhat', 'third', 'disc', 'episode', 'Longest', 'Day', 'Everyone', 'first', 'disc', 'commentary', 'back', 'actually', 'something', 'say.The', 'strongest', 'commentary', 'track', 'disc', 'four', 'Daddy', 'Girl', 'Feldman', 'Dushku', 'are', 'joined', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'who', 'much', 'needed', 'wry', 'sense', 'humour', 'proceedings', 'opportunity', 'playfully', 'make', 'fun', 'Dushku', 'very', 'entertaining', 'track.The', 'fifth', 'disc', 'commentary', 'Two', 'Pair', 'Feldman', 'Jason', 'Priestley', 'engage', 'quite', 'good', 'conversation', 'mythology', 'show', 'how', 'Priestley', 'character', 'shed', 'more', 'light', 'Tru', 'powers.The', 'final', 'disc', 'bulk', 'extra', 'material', 'audio', 'commentary', 'season', 'finale', 'Feldman', 'Dushku', 'Galifianakis.There', 'also', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'Finding', 'Calling', 'Pilot', 'making', 'episode', 'cast', 'talk', 'characters', 'usual', 'electronic', 'press', 'kit', 'format-soundbites', 'mixed', 'clips', 'show', 'Tru', 'Path', 'Season', 'One', 'overview', 'show', 'Dushku', 'mentions', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'tested', 'out', 'what', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'terms', 'material', 'characterization.The', 'show', 'clearly', 'hit', 'stride', 'arrival', 'Jason', 'Priestley', 'explored', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'Evil', 'Comes', 'Calling', 'Late', 'Season', 'Twist', 'show', 'creators', 'cast', 'Priestley', 'type', 'what', 'drew', 'show.Finally', 'music', 'video', 'show', 'theme', 'song', 'Somebody', 'Help', 'Me', 'Full', 'Blown', 'Rose.Tru', 'Calling', 'suffered', 'early', 'growing', 'pains', 'patience', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'season', 'show', 'became', 'surer', 'settled', 'fascinating', 'mythology', 'Tru', 'powers', 'role', 'Jack', 'Harper', 'life', 'Tru', 'Calling', 'really', 'started', 'get', 'good', 'Sadly', 'rumours', 'are', 'flying', 'show', 'been', 'cancelled', 'shooting', 'six', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'Hopefully', 'Fox', 'will', 'let', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'DVD']",N/A

849528,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B0002XVKMM,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[6, 8]","How often is it that a television show has deleted scenes and how often is it that these scenes are not only shown on the DVD but also have a commentary to accompany them. Well, when the DVD set for the first season of the little-known FOX show `Tru Calling' crossed over my desk not only had I never heard of the Eliza Dushku starring show, but I did not hold out much hope for a show that sounded cliched and contrived.But Dushku, who is probably best known to television audiences as Faith on `Buffy the Vampire Slayer,' portrays the title character and heroine Tru Davies with such conviction that it ended up being a very rewarding experience. Not to mention that, even though deleted scenes are a staple part of movie special features, I can never remember having watched deleted scenes from a television show - and not just on a couple of isolated episodes, but on several spread across the six DVDs.Also notable is the presence of a (one of many) cast and crew commentary on the Pilot episode that includes star Dushku. It's a lively, anecdotal dialogue in which a number of the participants seem to fall victim to a fit of the giggles as they recount re-shoots, locations and critique the fashion choices (did you know that the earrings Tru is seen wearing are actually Dushku's own? A pair she picked up on a trip to Latin America. Also, although he is not featured on the commentary I was very surprised to hear that award winning director Philip Noyce was the one calling the shots for the pilot.As far as the actual show is concerned it seems like a cross between `Quantum Leap', `ER' and  the Bill Murray comedy `Groundhog Day' but also so much more (and without the comedy).The show features clever dialogue and an amazing looking Dushku racing all over town (meant to be New York City, but revealed as Vancouver on the commentaries) in an effort to save lives and keep her drug-taking sister Meredith (played by Jessica Collins) and gambling younger brother Harrison (Shawn Reaves) out of trouble.The series starts with 22-year-old Tru having just graduated from college with the hopes of going on to medical school. When her internship at a local hospital falls through because of a withdrawal of funds, a friendly doctor tells her of a new position opened up that would do wonders on her resume - at the city morgue.Ten years earlier Tru had witnessed the murder of her mother and at the time insisted to her disbelieving sister and brother that their mother had talked to her. This however does not seem to have been an isolated incident as on her first day on the job, the corpse of a recently dead women turns to her asking her to `save me.' At that point Tru is instantly transported back to the beginning of the day at which point she must piece together the (sometimes briefest of) clues to figure out what happened, and how to stop it from happening.What sets this show apart from the other pop culture fare is that nearlu every episode has some sort of twists, a number of which actually do surprise. This is no straight forward adventure television show, its writing is notably well done and its characters compelling. I found myself watching episode after episode over the weekend until I was well into the third DVD.Timed to coincide with the start of the second season on Fox, this is a definite TiVo Season Pass candidate. The six disc DVD set includes all 20 first season episodes, commentaries, deleted scenes, featurettes, an actors audition easter egg and even a music video by Full Blown Rose.",4,Saw a review copy and this show proved a pleasant surprise,1100476800,"11 15, 2004",2004,3529,"['How', 'often', 'television', 'show', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'how', 'often', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'shown', 'DVD', 'also', 'have', 'commentary', 'accompany', 'Well', 'when', 'DVD', 'set', 'first', 'season', 'little-known', 'FOX', 'show', 'Tru', 'Calling', 'crossed', 'desk', 'not', 'only', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'starring', 'show', 'did', 'not', 'hold', 'out', 'much', 'hope', 'show', 'sounded', 'cliched', 'contrived.But', 'Dushku', 'who', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'television', 'audiences', 'Faith', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'title', 'character', 'heroine', 'Tru', 'such', 'conviction', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'very', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'Not', 'mention', 'even', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'staple', 'part', 'movie', 'special', 'features', 'can', 'never', 'remember', 'having', 'watched', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'television', 'show', 'not', 'just', 'couple', 'isolated', 'episodes', 'several', 'spread', 'six', 'DVDs.Also', 'notable', 'presence', 'one', 'many', 'cast', 'crew', 'commentary', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'star', 'Dushku', 'lively', 'anecdotal', 'dialogue', 'number', 'participants', 'seem', 'fall', 'victim', 'fit', 'giggles', 'recount', 're-shoots', 'locations', 'critique', 'fashion', 'choices', 'did', 'know', 'earrings', 'Tru', 'seen', 'wearing', 'are', 'actually', 'Dushku', 'own', 'pair', 'picked', 'up', 'trip', 'Latin', 'America', 'Also', 'not', 'featured', 'commentary', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'hear', 'award', 'winning', 'director', 'Philip', 'Noyce', 'was', 'one', 'calling', 'shots', 'pilot.As', 'far', 'actual', 'show', 'concerned', 'cross', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'ER', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'comedy', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'also', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'comedy', 'show', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'amazing', 'looking', 'Dushku', 'racing', 'town', 'meant', 'be', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'revealed', 'Vancouver', 'commentaries', 'effort', 'save', 'lives', 'keep', 'drug-taking', 'sister', 'Meredith', 'played', 'Jessica', 'Collins', 'gambling', 'younger', 'brother', 'Harrison', 'Shawn', 'Reaves', 'trouble.The', 'series', '22-year-old', 'Tru', 'having', 'just', 'graduated', 'college', 'hopes', 'going', 'medical', 'school', 'When', 'internship', 'local', 'hospital', 'falls', 'withdrawal', 'funds', 'friendly', 'doctor', 'new', 'position', 'opened', 'up', 'would', 'do', 'wonders', 'resume', 'city', 'morgue.Ten', 'years', 'earlier', 'Tru', 'had', 'witnessed', 'murder', 'mother', 'time', 'insisted', 'disbelieving', 'sister', 'brother', 'mother', 'had', 'talked', 'however', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'isolated', 'incident', 'first', 'day', 'job', 'corpse', 'recently', 'dead', 'women', 'asking', 'save', 'point', 'Tru', 'instantly', 'transported', 'back', 'beginning', 'day', 'point', 'must', 'piece', 'together', 'sometimes', 'briefest', 'clues', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'how', 'stop', 'happening.What', 'show', 'apart', 'other', 'pop', 'culture', 'fare', 'nearlu', 'episode', 'sort', 'twists', 'number', 'actually', 'do', 'surprise', 'straight', 'forward', 'adventure', 'television', 'show', 'writing', 'notably', 'well', 'done', 'characters', 'compelling', 'found', 'watching', 'episode', 'episode', 'weekend', 'was', 'well', 'third', 'DVD.Timed', 'coincide', 'start', 'second', 'season', 'Fox', 'definite', 'TiVo', 'Season', 'Pass', 'candidate', 'six', 'disc', 'DVD', 'set', '20', 'first', 'season', 'episodes', 'commentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'featurettes', 'actors', 'audition', 'easter', 'egg', 'even', 'music', 'video', 'Full', 'Blown', 'Rose']",N/A

849530,A3LTC7DKXI97WC,B0002XVKMM,Disney Fan,"[1, 3]","When I read that Tru Calling was going to be on dvd, I just had to order it. At first I had to think about it then after like a month or two of knowing, I finally pre-ordered it. Now that I got the dvd and I watched the first 2 episodes, I am SO GLAD that I decided to buy this dvd. Season 1 of Tru Calling is so good and I hope it will last long. I also hope that the other seasons will be on dvd as well. For sure I'll be one of those people who will ""pre-order"" it.Another review: 12/28/04When I first saw the previews for this show, last year in October 2003, I was interested in it. It looked really good. Well I had missed the very first episode (the pilot) but I still watched the 2nd epsiode. After the show was over, I thought to myself, ""THAT SHOW IS SO COOL!!!"" And it became one of my favorite shows of all time. So I kept watching and watching and then I tape some of the epiosodes since I sometimes missed it on Thursdays. But later on, I kept missing it. I missed like 2-3 episodes already but watched the rest. I tried to figure out who was who myself. Anyways after season 1 was over, I was hoping that they would put it on dvd. And they DID!!! I was so happy to find out that they were going to put season 1 on dvd.Well after a month of thinking about pre-ordering the dvd, I finally did it. Then I had to wait a while for it to arrive at my house. When it did, I was so excited that I watched the pilot the next day. That episode was good too. Then I watched the rest of the episodes that I had already watched, and I enjoyed watching them. A few weeks later, I watched this one episode that I had missed which played back in Jan 2004. That episode was good too. I am already on disc 3.Anyways my point is that Tru Calling is a good t.v series. And when Jason Presiely comes and joins the cast, that is when it gets interesting, esp when Tru and Davies finds out that Jack is really Tru's ""opposite""Then ending of Season 1 was good.

849531,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B0002XVKMM,D. Mok,"[2, 5]","In my mind, Eliza Dushku is the finest actress in her age group, combining electrifying charisma, a creative approach towards acting beats both internal and external, and a confident screen presence which probably comes of having entered the acting craft early, and ample experience in theatre.  She also has a knack for playing strong female characters without losing sight of their multi-dimensionality -- vulnerability with determination, sorrow with joy.Tru Calling uses her strengths extremely well and is about as close as we'll get to Faith the Vampire Slayer getting her own show.  From the start, the character of Tru anchors the show, and just like the earlier seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Tru Calling is deft in juggling humour with pathos, and weaving a cast of colourful supporting characters without losing sight of the main heroine.  Shawn Reaves, as Tru's delinquent brother Harrison, and Zach Galifianakis as mentor Davis provide a terrific contrast of comedic styles, with Reaves' over-the-top, hilarious physical comedy (sometimes downright clowning) an excellent foil for Galifianakis' straight-faced, deadpan subtlety.  I was also pleasantly surprised to see a great comic turn by A.J. Cook, as Tru's sweet yet bumbling best friend Lindsay.  I didn't like Cook's performance much in Final Destination 2, but she was great in Tru Calling.The central conceit of ""reliving days"" is so specific that it's bound to get a little familiar, but it does provide lots of interesting story angles.  The dramatic irony always provides a source of mirth -- most episodes of Tru Calling are like Groundhog Day, milked to the max.  At a certain point, of course, you'd know that almost everything that happens in an episode is a setup for something else, but that doesn't make it less fun to watch.There is one more thing about this show that impressed me a great deal, and that is its technical aspect.  It's no wonder creator Jon Harmon Feldman kept mentioning cinematographer David Moxness and composer Robert Duncan in the commentaries, because this show is one of the best-looking and -sounding shows I've seen on these two fronts.  I used to consider 24 the only truly cinematic TV show I've seen, and Tru Calling has that quality in its photography.  These two shows really push the boundaries of how TV shows should look -- kudos all the way.  And despite my usual dislike of post-modern editing tricks, this show incorporates these elements far more naturally, and therefore satisfyingly, than shows like Angel.There are some flaws that prevented me from giving a full five-star rating.  While the location of the show is unspecified, it is definitely a big American city, and the cast of the show, both supporting and lead, is a mite WASP-y for such a location.  The only Latino character in the recurring cast, morgue attendant Gardez, disappears midway through, and most of the single-episode characters are also lily-white.  So there is some point to people who accuse this show of being a bit ""90210"".  There are some one-note performances -- Jason Priestley plays Tru's nemesis Jack as a sleaze bag from beginning to end, and Jodi Lynn O'Keefe's bitchy guest turn for one episode was enough to make me gag.  It's always a problem when an actor treats a ""villain"" character as nothing but, and these two characters fail to ever play with our sympathies the way, say, Faith did in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Finally, characters over the course of the season disappear for no reason:  Where is big sister Meredith in the episode when Harrison's life is in danger?  And why does Lindsay disappear in the middle of the season?  TV shows sometimes do that because of actors' different commitments, but I think this can be done more elegantly than here -- Buffy the Vampire Slayer's Season 4 cleverly wrote out the part of Buffy's mother because of the absence of Kristine Sutherland, and I never noticed until well after the fact, watching Sutherland's interviews.But overall, Tru Calling is still loads of fun to watch.  Its lightning-fast story pacing ensures you will never be bored, and the characters still hold tons of fascination.  Word has it that Fox may not necessariliy renew this show all the way for its second season.  It would be a shame if this show were taken off the air, because it's a great show just for Eliza Dushku alone -- and the show has more than that to offer.

849532,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,B0002XVKMM,Duane Thomas,"[7, 17]","What's so frustrating about Tru Calling is that the elements of a great series are there - the creators HAD something. They just didn't know what to do with it. The premise is a killer. When she was 12, Tru Davies saw her mother murdered. At 22 and on her way to med school, a promised internship falls through, she takes a job working night shift at a city morgue. Her first night alone in the morgue, a corpse turns its head, stares into her eyes and whispers, ""Help me."" Suddenly time ""rewinds,"" Tru has hours to discover who the victim was, why she died, and prevent it. Every episode thereafter has Tru racing against time to save a life. Sometimes she succeeds, sometimes she doesn't.Great set-up, huh? Add into the mix that Tru Davies is played by Eliza Dushku who has more charisma in her little finger than most Hollywood actresses do in their entire bodies, a supporting cast of (mostly) decent actors, and how can you miss?Well, first you need to make all the regular cast but Tru so dysfunctional they're actively unpleasant to watch. Make Davis, Tru's boss and initially the only other person to know her secret, a socially maladept loser. (An indication of just how poor is the writing in Tru Calling: a basic rule of writing fiction is not to have multiple characters whose names sound too similar; it's confusing to the reader/viewer. Having our main character named ""Davies"" and her sidekick ""Davis"" wouldn't pass Writing 99.) Make her brother Harrison an unreliable, self-pitying compulsive gambler; her sister an overbearing, nasty drug addict; her best friend a classic case of lousy relationship skills who spends most of her time complaining about the lame men in her life without ever cluing into the fact she owns the responsibility for that; give Tru a boyfriend with a personality so limp you can't really say much good or bad about him. These are people you'd resent having to hang with in the real world if some horrible necessity made it unavoidable - and, if you do have a choice, you're certainly not going to spend an hour visiting them every week.But most importantly, if you want to pee away your great premise and talented star, you need bad writing, with the sort of groaners that make viewers go, ""Oh PLEASE."" Example: Have Tru investigate a young woman so desperate to unlock repressed memories of childhood molestation she risks repeated, life threatening Flatliners-type near death experiences. She returns from these ""trips"" knowing only that yes, she was molested, and for some reason has this image of stars and moons. Have her flip out, accuse her father of molesting her. And never let it occur to the woman, her father, or Tru (until late in the episode) this just might have something to do with the very distinctive pattern on the front door of the man who's lived right across the street from the family for, say, 20 years. Groan. (A major problem with Tru Calling, especially in early episodes: the ""twist"" endings are so clumsily obvious Tru seems like a moron for not figuring them out until half an hour after we do.)Here's another bad idea: Have Tru try to prevent a death that occurs during an armed robbery in the diner where she, her brother and sister eat on a regular basis (we've seen this diner numerous times already in the series). Inside the restaurant, Tru warns an off-duty cop of the impending crime. The robbery begins, the cop draws down, the robber takes a hostage at gunpoint as a human shield. And Tru talks her down. This is the sort of thing people notice, y'know? Then, to maintain her anonymity, Tru slinks out of the restaurant. And the cop never says, ""Hey, there was this girl...."" And the waitresses never say, ""Yeah, she comes in here all the time....as a matter of fact, the people she always sits with are standing right THERE."" She's just gone, incognito. Oh PLEASE.Tru Calling does have its good moments. We're six shows into the season before we get a truly (pun intended) satisfying episode (""Star Crossed""). Well-written, surprising ""twist"", no plot holes or groaners. A rare event, that. Eventually the addict sister goes into rehab, is completely missing for several episodes, then, except for a few brief appearances, is written out of the series. Since she's by far the most irritating character in the show, this is good. Harrison becomes a much more well-rounded and endearing little brother. Zach Galifianikis as Davis does a great job (aside from Eliza he's the show's biggest strength). Tru Calling benefits tremendously in later episodes from the introduction of Jack Harper (played by the criminally underrated Jason Priestley) as a sort of dark mirror image to Tru. But what never goes away are those moments of ghastly writing, of plot holes and twists so braindead you want to grab the writer and director by their throats and scream, ""What were you THINKING?""It's a real shame. Tru Calling could have been great. But it's not. And there are just enough flashes of brilliance to let us know what might have been.",2,"Well, It Ain't Exactly Joss Whedon",1107302400,"02 2, 2005",2005,5014,"['What', 'so', 'frustrating', 'Tru',

I was also intrigued by the premise of this show - Tru Davies, a young grad student relives days after corpses (who have passed due to unnatural circumstances) ask her for help. During her ""rewind days"" Tru races to prevent the death(s) while trying to keep her family & friends in the dark about her newfound abilities.The shows were initially slow-paced and monotonous and didn't really pick up until the 10th episode but there were other issues that I had with the show, mainly that I didn't buy Eliza in this role - I thought she was great on Buffy but this role was a little too safe for her, she is an edgy type of actress who had to conceal that in order to fit into this role.  Another issue was the writing & pacing of the earlier episodes.There is great chemistry between Eliza, Shawn Reaves (plays her brother, Harrison) and Zack Galifianakis (plays her morgue supervisor, Davis) and Jason Priestly (Jack harper) and although I love the actress A.J. Cook (plays her bestie, Lindsay) her role was unnecessary to the story and Jessica Collins (plays her sister, Meredith) who didn't mesh with any of them and also had a weak storyline that was unnecessary.That being said, there were a few episodes that I enjoyed prior to #10:#2 - PUTTING OUT FIRES: Tru tries to save a fire fighter#7 - MORNING AFTER: Tru tries to save her ex#9 - MURDER IN THE MORGUE: True tries to save Davis, a bride & possibly herselfAs the 2nd half of the season goes on, the pace picks up; the extraneous characters (sis & bestie) are written out while two other characters Cotter Smith (Tru's dad) and Jason Priestly are introduced and add danger & drama to the show.  The extras include commentary, deleted scenes and features on the making of this series.All in all I'd mildly recommend this set because although the series starts off a little slow it does become more interesting & intriguing by the end of the season.",3,Tru Calling - Season 1,1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,2026,"['Having', 'only', 'seen', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'was', 'really', 'curious', 'see', 'how', ""'d"", 'handle', 'leading', 'role', 'was', 'also', 'intrigued', 'premise', 'show', 'Tru', 'Davies', 'young', 'grad', 'student', 'days', 'corpses', 'who', 'have', 'passed', 'due', 'unnatural', 'circumstances', 'ask', 'help', 'rewind', 'days', 'Tru', 'races', 'prevent', 'death', 'trying', 'keep', 'family', 'friends', 'dark', 'newfound', 'abilities.The', 'shows', 'were', 'initially', 'slow-paced', 'monotonous', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'pick', 'up', '10th', 'episode', 'were', 'other', 'issues', 'had', 'show', 'mainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Eliza', 'role', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'Buffy', 'role', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'safe', 'edgy', 'type', 'actress', 'who', 'had', 'conceal', 'order', 'fit', 'role', 'issue', 'was', 'writing', 'pacing', 'earlier', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Eliza', 'Shawn', 'Reaves', 'brother', 'Harrison', 'Zack', 'Galifianakis', 'morgue', 'supervisor', 'Davis', 'Jason', 'Priestly', 'Jack', 'harper', 'love', 'actress', 'A.J', 'Cook', 'bestie', 'Lindsay', 'role', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'story', 'Jessica', 'Collins', 'sister', 'Meredith', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'also', 'had', 'weak', 'storyline', 'was', 'being', 'said', 'were', 'few', 'episodes', 'enjoyed', 'prior', '10', '2', 'PUTTING', 'OUT', 'FIRES', 'Tru', 'save', 'fire', 'fighter', '7', 'MORNING', 'AFTER', 'Tru', 'save', 'ex', '9', 'MURDER', 'THE', 'MORGUE', 'True', 'tries', 'save', 'Davis', 'bride', 'possibly', 'herselfAs', '2nd', 'half', 'season', 'pace', 'up', 'extraneous', 'characters', 'sis', 'bestie', 'are', 'written', 'out', 'two', 'other', 'characters', 'Cotter', 'Smith', 'Tru', 'dad', 'Jason', 'Priestly', 'are', 'introduced', 'add', 'danger', 'drama', 'show', 'extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'features', 'making', 'series.All', ""'d"", 'mildly', 'recommend', 'set', 'series', 'little', 'slow', 'become', 'more', 'interesting', 'intriguing', 'end', 'season']",N/A

I know, I know, they've been doing it for years but Tru Calling is a LOT like Quantum Leap. That's not to say it isn't any good, just unoriginal.Tru Davies relives days when dead bodies ask for her help. Each one of them will ask for something cryptic, such as 'save them', 'help her' or 'don't trust him', which Tru has to figure out in the course of her do-over day and stop whoever it is this time from dying and setting right what went wrong. Everything that Doctor Sam Beckett did before her. The story involving Jason Priestley was even exactly the same as a similar story in Quantum Leap.Remarkably, the show establishes the characters very well and rather quickly. Particularly Tru's younger brother Harrison (played by an actor older than Eliza Dushku), morgue boss Davis (Davies/Davis-who chose these names?) and her doomed boyfriend Luc.Typically, FOX cancelled it (like they do with everything that isn't The Simpsons) just as it was getting good. But never say never. Strong DVD sales brought back Family Guy. So you never know. But if it does come back I'd like if it doesn't assume the audience is really dumb and chuck in flashbacks to stuff that was obvious first time round in case we're too stupid to figure it out on our own. That got quite bugging. And what city is it set in? It felt a bit unnaturally claustrophobic that every episode was set in the middle of this unnamed burgh.

There was not bad episode and it got better and better as the season went on. Eliza Dushku plays Tru, a med student who works in a morgue. When someone dies by unatural causes, the dead asks for her help. Her day rewinds and she has the chance to save their life. The show is exciting, intense, emotional, and heartbreaking. The cast is flawless starting with Ms. Dushku who is so stunning, feisty,smart, and likeable she makes for the perfect heroine. Shawn Reeves as Trus brother Harrison makes for perfect comedic relief, but also proves he is a wonderful dramatic actor, and Zach Galifianakis as Davis is excellent as well. I was skeptical of the addition of Jason Priestly in the last 6 episodes, but he proved he can do alot more than play Brandon Walsh. There are many highlights it's hard to choose the best episodes. My favorites include ""Putting Out Fires"" which had me in tears. ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" which was Tru trying to stop a beauty pageant contestant from dying, ""Death Becomes Here"" guests starring American Idol alum Tamyra Gray, ""The Longest Day"" which was a truly riveting hour of television, and the final 2 episodes ""D.O.A"" and ""Two Weddings and a Funeral"" where Tru learns the truth about Jack(Jason Priestly).

I'm glad Tru Calling never goes into hard detail like a cop show or becomes about morals. Tru Davies is sort of a superhero that prevents bad things happening to good people. She gains a power and feels compelled to help. Thats it. There are moments when she discovers her past and also gains friendship too. If you liked Medium, Buffy, or other paranormal shows there is a good chance you'll like Tru Calling. The editing style kind of reminds me of Jake 2.0. Everything goes fast and this show won't bore you to death. I really love the 2002-2004 TV style and a lot of media from that era had an extreme amounts of potential. The cinematography is pretty clean, grabs my interest, and is not too jarring, which I like a lot. The characters grow on you, and its a pretty light show. Zach Gallifinakis isn't as funny in it as you'd think and the guy from 90210 doesn't show up till later, but it doesn't matter. Tru calling is not too nerdy and doesn't have many Joss Whedon-like dork moments which is also a nice change of pace from today. I really like the style of this show and I think Eliza Dushku is a real star. You do forget she was in Dollhouse after watching this one. I prefer the Tru character. Its fun to watch and the storylines make you reflect in the same way that watching Buffy did. Overall a good show and good DVD release. While not quite as amazing as other shows she's been in, Tru Calling is worth picking up. If you make it through the first disk there is a good chance you'll keep going to the end.About the disk..it has deleted scenes and some commentary which is nice to see on something thats already bit the dust. The production value of the menus is pretty high. I even like the photography and print. If my set wasn't beat up it would look really nice. Everything reflects the show and is an enjoyable experience. The video is very good for DVD and the audio is good too. Tru Calling is definitely a buy if you like Eliza Dushku. I should also mention that there are tons of now-famous actors that played characters in this show (young Christina Hendricks). Its a little cheesy, but who cares.

I only wish she had done a spin-off from Buffy the Vampire Slayer instead of Tru Calling. That show would have rocked because, as Faith, Eliza has no peer. What a butt-kicking vampire slaying babe!Yet, in spite of Eliza's charisma, the first season of Tru Calling is lame with a capital ""L."" Can you say ""repetitive""? Yeah, I thought you could.Until Jason Priestley arrived in the character of Jack Harper, each show was as exciting as its premise would lead one to believe: reliving each day. Over and over again. Not necessarily in the often tedious plots, but following each commercial break when every minute from the previous 10-12 would whiz by so to catch people up on what transpired. As if they'd forget. This flashback  technique, in effect, forced people to watch Tru relive a day (or at least the show) 3-4 times every episode. Talk about tedious!Once Priestley joined the cast, however, Tru had someone to play off of. There was tension. And a budding subplot. Before that, Eliza was the whole show. Over and over again.Granted, she's pretty easy on the eyes. But in Tru Calling she didn't have Joss Whedon's crisp, witty dialog to propel her from scene to scene. I don't know who was writing Tru Calling during its first season, but a less deft style I can't imagine. Didn't any of those writers ever take Robert McKee's ""Story"" seminar or read his book? Gee whiz. The most rudimentary basics of screenwriting may have been present (maybe), but that's about all.Buying Tru Calling on DVD is a coin-toss decision for me. I think Eliza is great. I'd like to listen to some commentary tracks.

This woman has the ability to save lives and does everything she can to, to the detriment of her own personal life does so. Eliza Dushku is a great actor and highly underrated. I loved her on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and she continues to prove her talent in Tru Calling. Shawn Reaves is talented and adds not just drama but certain type of comic relief. Jason Priestly, what can I say that hasn't already been said. He's not only extremely talented, but incredibly charming. He's got what they call in Hollywood the ""it"" quality. Rob Duncan who scores the show does a wonderful job. He did the final episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and it what an amazing work of art. He is quite the musical artist. I bought this DVD set without ever having seen any of it on television, trusting that the casting and creative people behind the scene would be enough for me to be assured that I would like it. Not only do I like it, but I love it. My only regret is that they didn't give the show a fair chance. I think at the very least that they should have been permitted to finish out the season. Just when Tru is going to find out about her Dad they end it. I felt cheated. It still had a lot of room for more great story telling and character development.

Cook. Unfortunately it didn't live up to its potential for me, and I think the responsibility I'm sorry to say is that of the creator.The first season was pretty average, and the stories were good. They just didn't go as far as they could have done, particularly in the emotional scenes. Recent dramas like Ally McBeal and Buffy that have really tapped into emotions have set the bar really high. A bar a little too high for Tru Calling.That is Tru Calling - the first season. The second season on the other hand is a whole different story. So much better.

If you're looking to buy the dvd, you're probably already a fan.  But in case you haven't seen the show on tv and are wondering if you should give this show a chance because you loved Eliza Dushku (and writers) from BUFFY, then this review is for you.Unfortunately, Eliza and the role of Tru are a bad fit.  The Eliza/Faith combo was absolute dynamite, and I'm a huge fan of Eliza as an actress.  The character of Faith was complicated - Faith was all tortured and dark and bold-as-brass - in a word, fascinating.  Dushku fit this role superbly and shone.  Tru, however, is a (smart) every-girl trying to lead the audience through a world-gone-mad.  BUT, Eliza is too colorful for the every-girl: she's too scrappy, sexy, and, frankly, interesting to really be a convincing Tru, a character who seems bland and boring by comparison.  Having seen Eliza's performance as Faith, I kept hoping the writers of TRU CALLING would give her more material to work with -even if it was just internal - SOME arc to Tru's character.  But, I guess the show really needed an every-girl, and it felt like Eliza's talent was stifled.Ultimately, the show just didn't have IT.  While the premise had a lot of potential, it wasn't fully realized.  We had seen QUANTUM LEAP.  We'd seen BUFFY.  TRU CALLING needed an angle - a corner on the market of this genre.  It wasn't that funny (although the Davis character was well done).  It wasn't that suspenseful.  There were some twists and turns to the plots, but the pacing was too slow for the savvy and sophisticated tv audience.  On the commentaries, a topic of discussion was concern for the clarity of the show - selling the audience on the ""outlandish"" premise.  But all of the little flashbacks to remind everyone of key plot points felt kind of patronizing, especially now after years of ALIAS and 24.  Overall, I think they were too conservative out of fear of alienating their audience, which is too bad, because I really, really wanted to love this one!",3,If you love FAITH...,1178496000,"05 7, 2007",2007,2143,"['then', 'TRU', 'CALLING', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'probably', 'not', 'show', ""'ll"", 'return', 'often', ""'re"", 'looking', 'buy', 'dvd', ""'re"", 'probably', 'already', 'fan', 'case', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'tv', 'are', 'wondering', 'should', 'give', 'show', 'chance', 'loved', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'writers', 'BUFFY', 'then', 'review', 'you.Unfortunately', 'Eliza', 'role', 'Tru', 'are', 'bad', 'fit', 'Eliza/Faith', 'combo', 'was', 'absolute', 'dynamite', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Eliza', 'actress', 'character', 'Faith', 'was', 'complicated', 'Faith', 'was', 'tortured', 'dark', 'bold-as-brass', 'word', 'fascinating', 'Dushku', 'fit', 'role', 'superbly', 'shone', 'Tru', 'however', 'smart', 'every-girl', 'trying', 'lead', 'audience', 'world-gone-mad', 'BUT', 'Eliza', 'too', 'colorful', 'every-girl', 'too', 'scrappy', 'sexy', 'frankly', 'interesting', 'really', 'be', 'convincing', 'Tru', 'character', 'who', 'bland', 'boring', 'comparison', 'Having', 'seen', 'Eliza', 'performance', 'Faith', 'kept', 'hoping', 'writers', 'TRU', 'CALLING', 'would', 'give', 'more', 'material', 'work', '-even', 'was', 'just', 'internal', 'SOME', 'arc', 'Tru', 'character', 'guess', 'show', 'really', 'needed', 'every-girl', 'felt', 'Eliza', 'talent', 'was', 'stifled.Ultimately', 'show', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'IT', 'premise', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'was', ""n't"", 'fully', 'realized', 'had', 'seen', 'QUANTUM', 'LEAP', ""'d"", 'seen', 'BUFFY', 'TRU', 'CALLING', 'needed', 'angle', 'corner', 'market', 'genre', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Davis', 'character', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'suspenseful', 'were', 'twists', 'plots', 'pacing', 'was', 'too', 'slow', 'savvy', 'sophisticated', 'tv', 'audience', 'commentaries', 'topic', 'discussion', 'was', 'concern', 'clarity', 'show', 'selling', 'audience', 'outlandish', 'premise', 'little', 'flashbacks', 'remind', 'everyone', 'key', 'plot', 'points', 'felt', 'kind', 'patronizing', 'especially', 'now', 'years', 'ALIAS', '24', 'Overall', 'think', 'were', 'too', 'conservative', 'fear', 'alienating', 'audience', 'too', 'bad', 'really', 'really', 'wanted', 'love', 'one']",N/A

849550,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B0002XVKMM,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[10, 11]","When I first got recommended this on Amazon, I had to have it. It took me a few weeks of trying to resist temptation, and hunting around for a better price, but I couldn't find one. I ended up buying it for myself, for Christmas, and getting it two days before! So that was a nice present to get!Eliza Dushku is one of my favourite actresses at the moment - she's gorgeous! I still remember her in the early role of Arnie's daughter in Tru(e) Lies, and then her fabulous roles in Bring It On & Wrong Turn. She also appeared in Buffy, as a character called Faith, but I can safely say, I've never seen an episode of that show.With each episode, you'll be drawn deeper into the world of Tru Davies, and you'll be discovering that the name of the series `Tru Calling' can have so much depth to it, and different meanings, and can be interpreted in many ways.The credits are brilliant - they're your typical TV show credits, but have the added advantage of a great song ""Somebody Help Me"" by Full Blown Rose, and they're over pretty fast. Where the adverts would have originally been (probably making the show last an hour with it's original airing on TV), they're cool, quick, and funky segments, of the ""flashbacks"" that continuously appear throughout the show. Also, from about half way through the series, the episode names take a different turn, and seem to have the names of films. Look for yourself.PILOT - Not the most original title for the first episode of a TV series. This is a rather slow beginning, as we get introduced to all the characters, but we soon get thrown into the thick of things, with Tru's first reliving happening pretty soon. This also features her doing a lot of running around (for all the guys, and for anyone who remembers Baywatch, this is for you), and lots of calls being taken & received on mobiles.PUTTING OUT FIRES - Not everyone can be saved as Tru finds out the hard way, on only her second reliving.BROTHER'S KEEPER - We get a bit more of a look in to Harrison's (her brother's) life here, as he features in smaller roles in the previous episodes. He's played by the cute Shawn Reaves (albeit blonde), who certainly looks like Owen Wilson's younger brother.PAST TENSE - The thing about these episodes is they're all very similar, with formulaic plot lines, and Tru always manages to point the finger at the wrong person.HAUNTED - Not one of the best episodes so far, but definitely an interesting concept. Tru helps a young med student who dies after participating in a secret experiment in which her heart is temporarily stopped.STAR-CROSSED - One where Tru points the finger at different characters, and then it all comes clear towards the end of the episode, yet again very formulaic.MORNING AFTER - Her ex-boyfriend & college professor appears again in this, and for once, the finger is pointed at Tru, and she has to work her butt off to figure out who's killed him.CLOSURE - This is the saddest episode of the series. I was practically in tears just watching it. Ryan Kwanten, formerly Vinnie Patterson in Home & Away, stars in this, and this will show you despite how hard Tru tries, sometimes, she can't save everyone.MURDER IN THE MORGUE - A really interesting twist to the story, having Tru trying to stop HERSELF getting murdered, and Davis too. A gripping story, complete with slow motion bullet scene, similar to the ones in Matrix.REUNION - Episode set at the high school reunion, where the littlest thing Tru does, sets off a major chain of events.THE LONGEST DAY - This is an episode where Tru discovers someone HAS to die, in order for perhaps someone else to live, and she has a tough time figuring this out.VALENTINE - With a nosy reporter chasing Tru, we finally find out the connection between her & her mother through Davis, and to be honest, it's pretty predictable.DROP DEAD GORGEOUS - Hmm, strange episode here. It's called by the same name of a movie about a beauty pageant, and has a lot of the plot from Miss Congeniality too!DADDY'S GIRL - The first appearance of Jason Priestley, ex Beverley Hills 90210 star, who's aged badly! You're busy trying to figure out what exactly he is, and why.THE GETAWAY - Not much to say about this episode, apart from Tru confessing all, and not being believed.TWO PAIR - This episode involves Harrison getting involved in helping Tru, and once & for all believing her.DEATH BECOMES HER - Jason Priestley's character, Jack, is still hanging around, and believe me, you'll be clutching at straws, and coming up with all kinds of impossible answers as to why he's around!REAR WINDOW - The end of this episode is the best part - we finally find out what is with Jack Harper.D.O.A - More is revealed about Jack, in the penultimate episode, which will leave you shocked, and dying to watch the final episode.TWO WEDDINGS & A FUNERAL - You'll be left open mouthed by the end of this episode, and I'm literally dying for the second season to come out on DVD now. So far, the second season hasn't fared too well in the USA, and whether it will get a cult following or not, is waiting to be found out. But the producers definitely have my vote for it to continue - it's too addictive for words.With 20 episodes spread over 4 discs, averaging at 40 minutes each, and extras including selected episode commentary, deleted scenes, featurettes (Finding The Calling: The Pilot; The Tru Path: Season One; and Evil Comes Calling: A Late Season Twist) and ""Somebody Help Me"" music video by Full Blown Rose,

849552,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B0002XVKMM,Mitch Weaver,"[20, 22]","I have been a huge fan of Eliza Dushku's ever since I first saw her play the character Faith in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. However, when I first heard about her new show Tru Calling, I was extremely skeptical. Not only because the show looked ridiculous, but also because of the fact that FOX has a tendency to cancel their new shows. Anyone who was a fan of John Doe or Fastlane knows what I am talking about. Out of my loyalty to Eliza, I decided to give the show a chance. After watching the pilot episode, I was geniunely suprised that I found myself anticipating the next episode. As the show went on, I found myself liking it more and more each week. But as good as the show was throughout the season, it becomes flat out addictive after Jason Priestly joins the cast. When the season finally ended supplying one of the best cliffhangers I have ever seen, I was blown away at how good the show turned out to be. In my opinion, Tru Calling was the best show on television last year after Smallville. Both Alias and 24 that offered superior seasons in the past, failed to produce a third season that could match the first season of Tru Calling.The concept behind the show is one that is both unique and interesting. While there have been shows where the main character helps people before, this was the first show that I have seen where a dead person gets a second chance at life by asking for help. Watching Tru relive a particular day to stop a person from dying with such little to go on, is really suspenseful. Each week, the show manages to supply a ""race against the clock"" type feel. The performances in this show are suprisingly good. Eliza is not only beautiful, but she is great in the role of Tru as well. Zach Galifianakis is superb as Tru's boss Davis. Since Davis knows what Tru can do, he helps Tru with each mission and the interaction between them is great. Jason Priestly comes in with only six episodes left, but is fantastic in the role and he did such a good job that he was kept on as a regular character for the second season. Shawn Reaves is also very entertaining as Tru's younger brother Harrison.

Hardy,"[6, 7]","When I first of heard of Tru calling I was skeptic at best, mostly because all of the other shows having to do with the dead and people that can hear them were all pretty much a big bust and didn't stay on. I had mixed feelings towards the show because 1): It was the first time Eliza Dushku would have her own series and wasn't standing in Sarah Michelle Gellar's shadow; 2): I thought were was no point in watching it because I had a feeling it was going to be canceled. Much to my delight my second feeling was wrong; Tru Calling made it all the way to its season finale.Anyway, Tru Davies signs up for a job at the mourge, and suddenly she begins to hear a voice pleading for help. Tru is thrown for a loop when she discovers its one of the dead bodies that was rescently brought in and finds herself relving a day and trying to stop the death of the woman (Hudson Leick; Callisto of Xena:WP), a stranger before it happens.From there the episodes becomore more enshrouded in mystery as to why Davies has the strange gift she has and others things surrounding her life. The plot for the series has some serious depth to it and unlike Buffy: the vampire slayer, ""Tru calling"" doesn't focus soley on the lead character and relationships with the men she dates, but on many.This series really brings Dushku's acting talents to light and its a good series to watch or buy if your looking for something close to original and has something new to offer.

849560,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0002XVKMM,Robert Moore,"[3, 3]","I resisted watching TRU CALLING when it first came out, largely because of bitterness over what turned out to be unsubstantiated rumors that Eliza Dushku had chosen to star in this show rather than a Faith spin off from BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  I relented a little bit a year or so again when I read an interview with Joss Whedon in which he asserted that there had never been a Faith series.  Oh, yeah, there had been some talk about possibly developing such a series, and at the end of Season One of TRU CALLING, there was renewed discussion when it seemed inevitable that the show would be cancelled.  But in fact there never was a concrete proposal for a Faith series.  Whedon never pitched a network, never wrote a proposal, never wrote a script, never wrote an outline of a Faith series.  On the other hand, Eliza Dushku was offered the lead role in an actual pitched and accepted series.Now I have seen TRU CALLING and I have to report that except for one spectacularly cringe-inducing aspect of the show, I actually really enjoyed it.  The ""cringe"" came each week when that week's corpse asked for Tru's help.  I'm not sure that anything in any major series of the past ten years caused me such pain as that one utterly horrid moment.  You knew each week that at some point a corpse would suddenly animate, turn its head, and ask for Tru's help.  I can't think of any good alternative to this, but I'm not hired as a script writer in Hollywood.  Surely a first-rate writer could have thought of an alternative of the corpse-turning-its-head-of-the-week horror.  It is impossible to imagine that Joss Whedon would have allowed such a travesty to take place each week.  Luckily, Joss Whedon is the brains behind Eliza Dushku's next series, DOLLHOUSE, which will start in the fall of 2008 on FOX.Apart from that one appalling moment each week, TRU CALLING was actually a pretty decent show.  It had one of the marks of a good show:  it got better and better as it went along.  Each episode followed a formulaic structure, but all concerned with the project tried to make it surpass those limitations.  Much of this was in the gradual development of a long story arc, something that unfortunately got nipped in the bud with the cancellation of the series early in Season Two.  But even with the ending of the show, there was a sense that there was not an endless repetition of the same episode, but a progressive story.  This came in stages:  Davis's revelation that he knew about Tru's gift; her learning that she possessed the same gift that her mother had; the introduction of Jack (Jason Priestly) as Tru's nemesis; and the discovery that her father backed Jack and previously played the same role as Jack in oppostion to Tru's mother (btw, fans of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA should note that in the episode where we see Tru's mother in flashback, the role of Tru's mother was played by the same actress who plays Seelix in BSG).  The show was revealing symptoms of becoming a far more interesting show when it was cancelled.  From a business standpoint it is hard to fault the cancellation of the show; the ratings were extraordinarily awful.  From an aesthetic point of view, it is regretable.One thing is made clear on the show (and should encourage anyone looking forward to DOLLHOUSE this fall):  Eliza Dushku can carry a show.  She was far and away the best thing in the series and every moment that she spends onscreen is a delight.  On BUFFY she made a habit of stealing scenes or at least providing unforgetable moments in conjunction with other actors (especially vampires; her scenes with David Boreanaz as Angel on the eponymous series or her scenes with James Marsters as Spike on BUFFY were unforgetable).  But she had never been asked to carry a show.  Here she did and did so brilliantly.  Whatever faults the show had -- and it had several -- they were not Eliza Dushku's.I did have some problems with the casting of the secondary characters.  Zach Galifianakis was excellent as Davis, her mentor/sidekick in the morgue, but this was offset by the unceasingly annoying Shawn Reaves as Tru's brother Harrison.  He was so persistently stupid from one episode to another that you wonder why Tru didn't just slap him and yell at him to stop being such a perpetual idiot.  The third sibling was Meredith, played by the almost impossibly gorgeous Jessica Collins.  On a countless number of shows an initial line up of characters are imagined, but as the shows go along some fail to find much of a role.  I loved the lovely Ms. Collins, but the writers never found much to do with her character.  I never came to enjoy Jason Priestly much in his role as Tru's nemesis.  Perhaps old 90210 fans felt differently.  But overall, apart from Davis and Matthew Bomer's Luc, I never felt like many of the supporting characters added much to the show.  This is more the fault of the writers than the actors.All in all, I was delightfully surprised at TRU CALLING.  It started off slowly, but by the end it was a surprisingly decent series.  Unfortunately by then no one was watching it.  But it is definitely a show worth watching.  And if you are a fan of Eliza Dushku it is a must-see.  She was at every moment the best thing the series had to offer.",4,Very surprisingly a pretty decent show,1208044800,"04 13, 2008",2008,5257,"['resisted', 'watching', 'TRU', 'CALLING', 'when',

It's not as simple as a hero/villain dynamic, it is that, but it's a lot more than that, and when the show returns for its second season, we'll see exactly how this new dynamic is explored.  Eliza Dushku is wonderful as Tru Davies, she has a great sense of doing the right thing, she also portrays the burden of having to always figure out a way of finding things out and changing things for the better.  She's headstrong and charges into things sometimes without thinking, but more often than not proves herself to be extremely adept to thinking on her feet.  I even love the guy that plays Davis, he's her mentor, the wise old sage that guides her along her path.  In many ways he's kind of like her Watcher (big Buffy injoke, considering who Eliza used to portray).  And of course, Harrison, the loveable guy that always gets into trouble and has to be bailed out at some point, you love the guy because you know he's got a good heart and as the season progressed he began making changes in order to become a better person.  The show has potential, and we need to let people of that potential and to let people know how cool this show is.",5,Tru Calling is the best show and deserves to remain that way,1098144000,"10 19, 2004",2004,1624,"['tuned', ""'Tru"", 'Calling', 'week', 'episodes', 'were', 'better', 'others', 'obivously', 'show', 'was', 'unique', 'had', 'people', 'cared', 'addition', 'Jason', 'Priestly', 'character', 'added', 'whole', 'new', 'dimension', 'show', 'not', 'exactly', 'evil', 'Jack', 'what', 'doing', 'right', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Tru', 'Besides', 'character', 'sense', 'regards', 'ideals', 'equal', 'opposing', 'forces', 'more', 'show', 'made', 'show', 'even', 'better', 'not', 'as', 'simple', 'hero/villain', 'dynamic', 'lot', 'more', 'when', 'show', 'second', 'season', ""'ll"", 'see', 'exactly', 'how', 'new', 'dynamic', 'explored', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'wonderful', 'Tru', 'Davies', 'great', 'sense', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'also', 'burden', 'having', 'always', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'finding', 'things', 'out', 'changing', 'things', 'better', 'headstrong', 'charges', 'things', 'sometimes', 'thinking', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'be', 'extremely', 'adept', 'thinking', 'feet', 'even', 'love', 'guy', 'Davis', 'mentor', 'wise', 'old', 'sage', 'path', 'many', 'ways', 'kind', 'Watcher', 'big', 'Buffy', 'injoke', 'considering', 'who', 'Eliza', 'used', 'portray', 'course', 'Harrison', 'loveable', 'guy', 'always', 'trouble', 'be', 'bailed', 'out', 'point', 'love', 'guy', 'know', 'got', 'good', 'heart', 'season', 'progressed', 'began', 'making', 'changes', 'order', 'become', 'better', 'person', 'show', 'potential', 'need', 'let', 'people', 'potential', 'let', 'people', 'know', 'how', 'cool', 'show']",N/A

849564,A1GSTCPM8NRZRV,B0002XVKMM,Sebastien Pharand,"[4, 7]","I have to admit that I was not expecting much of Tru Calling. Upon watching the show's premiere in the fall of 2003, I was expecting to see just another genre outing that wouldn't do much for me. Well, surprise, surprise. I really enjoyed the premiere, and the rest of the season for that matter. Tru calling was a very enjoyable genre fest that, unfortunately, was never given the chance to grow.Eliza Dushku is perfectly cast as Tru, the young woman who works in a morgue. Sometimes, dead bodies reawaken and ask for her help. The clock winds back, time rewinds, and Tru is given a new chance to help this or that character from his or her inevitable fate.The stories are usually completely enjoyable and full of twists and turns. And the series works so well because of all of its quirky supporting characters; like Tru's troublesome brother, her is-he-or-isn't-he boyfriend, her drug addict sister and her boss at the morgue, probably the funniest and most mysterious character in the series.Unfortunately, near the end of the season, the series took a turn for the worse when a new character played by Jason Priestly was introduced. The actor is totally miscast as Tru's nemesis. He seems uncomfotable and bored in his role. The character isn't well defined, but we could blame this on the fact that this subplot was never given the chance to grow before the series was cancelled by FOX.I'm surprised that the show didn't have a bigger audience. The soundtrack is hip and modern, the style of the show incredibly well thought-of and very intersting to look at, the set pieces are very atmospheric and intriguing... This show had a lot going for it. Of course, putting it on Thursday night against must-see tv was a deathwish. I guess FOX never really had fate in this series.Fans of Buffy and Angel, as well as genre outings (such as the X-Files) should be able to enjoy Tru Calling. Dushku is great, and the stories had be going week after week. I'm glad to see this series out on dvd. And hopefully, if it is successfull, it will help FOX make the decision it should have done in September; to bring Tru Calling back on the air!",4,Great Genre TV,1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,2135,"['have', 'admit', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'Tru', 'Calling', 'watching', 'show', 'premiere', 'fall', '2003', 'was', 'expecting', 'see', 'just', 'genre', 'outing', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'Well', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'premiere', 'rest', 'season', 'matter', 'Tru', 'calling', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'genre', 'fest', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'never', 'given', 'chance', 'grow.Eliza', 'Dushku', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Tru', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'morgue', 'Sometimes', 'dead', 'bodies', 'reawaken', 'ask', 'help', 'clock', 'back', 'time', 'rewinds', 'Tru', 'given', 'new', 'chance', 'help', 'character', 'inevitable', 'fate.The', 'stories', 'are', 'usually', 'completely', 'enjoyable', 'full', 'twists', 'turns', 'series', 'so', 'well', 'quirky', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Tru', 'troublesome', 'brother', ""is-he-or-isn't-he"", 'boyfriend', 'drug', 'addict', 'sister', 'boss', 'morgue', 'probably', 'funniest', 'most', 'mysterious', 'character', 'series.Unfortunately', 'end', 'season', 'series', 'took', 'turn', 'worse', 'when', 'new', 'character', 'played', 'Jason', 'Priestly', 'was', 'introduced', 'actor', 'totally', 'miscast', 'Tru', 'nemesis', 'uncomfotable', 'bored', 'role', 'character', ""n't"", 'well', 'defined', 'could', 'blame', 'fact', 'subplot', 'was', 'never', 'given', 'chance', 'grow', 'series', 'was', 'cancelled', 'FOX.I', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'bigger', 'audience', 'soundtrack', 'hip', 'modern', 'style', 'show', 'incredibly', 'well', 'thought-of', 'very', 'intersting', 'look', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'very', 'atmospheric', 'intriguing', 'show', 'had', 'lot', 'going', 'course', 'putting', 'Thursday', 'night', 'must-see', 'tv', 'was', 'deathwish', 'guess', 'FOX', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'fate', 'series.Fans', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'as', 'well', 'genre', 'outings', 'such', 'X-Files', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'Tru', 'Calling', 'Dushku', 'great', 'stories', 'had', 'be', 'going', 'week', 'week', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'series', 'out', 'dvd', 'hopefully', 'successfull', 'will', 'help', 'FOX', 'make', 'decision', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'September', 'bring', 'Tru', 'Calling', 'back', 'air']",N/A

I have been a huge fan of her's for a very long time, and so I just had to have it. I didnt exspect to become so addicted, but I did. There is only one flaw though..........for most of the season it seemed like the writers really didnt know where the show was heading. Every episode was the same (relive day save person(s)). Episode 15 is where the series starts to pick up with the introduction of Jack Harper. Jack can also relive days, but there is a catch, he makes sure the people that ask for Tru's help stay dead.I am one of the few who dont like Jack very much. Sure he makes the series more interesting but he is so fraking annoying.

One day the corpses start saying ""help me"" to her. Luckily, they don't get off the table and chop her head off. That's ""Dawn of the Dead"" and if you're looking for zombies you're on the wrong page. Tru discovers she has the ability to ""rewind"", i.e., relive the last 24 hours in an effort to prevent the deceased from becoming, well, deceased. It's God's way of a do-over. Sytlishly directed, ""Tru Calling"" reminds me a bit of ""Buffy"" crossed with a mystery. We know that somebody has died we just don't know why Tru needs to save them and how they died. As the season progresses we also discover that Tru has an opposite--a grim reaper working against her. Who and why is revealed in the last couple of episodes of season one.My only complaint about the box set is the way its packaged. There's two DVDs in each slim DVD holder and there's a chance that they could be damaged from slamming into each other (or as happened with one of the promos I received, it got stuck on the wrong DVD holder with the playing side facing out). Still, the picture, sound quality and general look of the series is quite good.The ensemble cast does a great job making the incredible credible. There's a handful of very good featurettes on the series, an Easter Egg and a number of very good commentaries are a highlight of this terrific set. The featurettes include interviews with producers/creator Feldman, the main actors about the development the show, the auditions they had to go through ahd changes the show made prior to airing on the network. Zach Galifianakis proves to have quite a dry, self depreciating wit and could easily be the next Bill Murray.Feldman's observations in the commentary tracks are nicely complimented particularly on the last two hour episode (which is presented here as two one hour episode for some weird reason) of the first season by some very funny asides from actors Zach Galifianakis and Eliza Dushku.  The commentary on ""Two Pair"" by Feldman and Priestly is also very entertaining and funny.Only time will tell if Tru calls the audience the way the network hopes. ""Tru Calling"" gets off to a promising start with a fine first season that offers a whole lot more in the future.
