I thought surely it was done in the 80s or earlier, before they learned travel shows could be interesting. However, it claims to have been made in 2012. The narrators sound like they were told to speak in the most monotone voice they could as they drone on and on about the height and width of a wall. The camera slowly, slowly pans over the same wall for far too long.  Watching this felt like being back in high school when the teacher would put on this kind of video so she could grade papers. Thank goodness that this time I could turn it off.

I've been to the Trulli houses in Alberobello. Maybe it went on too long FOR ME. Been to the Cinque Terra. They could have done a much better job. France? Nothing about Paris!

I thought this would be a travel overview of some of the natural and human made sights in France and Italy. Instead it is a ridiculously overly detailed explanation of several architectural features in a few cities. Rome? Nothing! Paris? Nothing! On top of it, they seemed to have found two women to ""narrate"" who have been lobotomized and taken several ambien. They could not possibly speak more slowly or in more of a monotone.  Amazon should stop selling this item or at least provide an accurate description of what exactly it is. I managed to torturously get through maybe 1/4 of it, and watched it on fast forward some. Since none of the areas on my impending trip to Rome and Paris were included, even that was not relevant to me. Expect to see any other sites such as Venice, Florence, or Naples, well don't look here. I returned it due to the false advertising.
