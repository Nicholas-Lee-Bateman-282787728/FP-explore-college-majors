Up there with the better made animations but not the best like &#34;Rango&#34; & &#34;Ratatouille&#34;.2. Acceptable (but nothing new) storyline of being different and going on a journey with the usual obstacles to prove your worth.The not so good:1. Background mattes or overlays were typical cheap production savers of a non-moving, still or unchanging scene. Leaves, clouds, grass, critters - just frozen in time. Miyazaki would roll over in his grave.2. Voicing was OK at best and for the most part just didn't give character or emotion to our acting animals.3. The customary animal song and dance numbers were really weak. Not catchy fun, not good music choreography. Additionally, a feeble attempt at introducing traditional African sounds.4.

I am reluctant to discourage their efforts but they need to do a lot better than this if they want to reach the top. The story is rather silly, the animation not very realistic and there are far too many American accents in a southern African animal story.
