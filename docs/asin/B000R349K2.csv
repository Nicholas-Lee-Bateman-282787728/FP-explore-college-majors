1078797,A21IIROYHZV7VO,B000R349K2,BlackDragon,"[0, 0]","The first episodes of ""Richard Carpenter's Robin of Sherwood"" came out in the early 1980's on public broadcasting t.v. They were AWESOME! The story line and characters were rich and complelling. I especially liked Michael Praed (Robin of Loxley), his acting abilities gave flair to his character and there was a nice on screen chemistry with Judi Trott (Marion). I was very sad when the series killed Robin for the finale.But the series was continued . . . Herne the hunter picks a new champion . . . Robert of Huntington (Jason Connery) the son of an Earl, to pick up where Robin of Loxley left off. Robert initally denies Herne, saying he could never take Robin's place as the Hooded Man. But when Marion (Judi Trott) is kidnapped by the evil Lord Owen of Clun, he is faced with the task of finding the rest of the band to help free her. This mission brings them together and the group sees that while Robert is not like their former leader, there is still goodness in him and his heart is in the right place. Marion still grieves for her former husband and despite Roberts obvious interest in her she is reluctant to give her heart to another man who can break it. The finale was awesome, Marion gives her heart to Robin who vows he will NEVER leave her, the evil Gulmar (Richard O'Brian) returns with a monsterous creation intent on killing Herne the Hunter, a cliff-hanger yet (thankfully the writers DIDN'T kill this Robin off . . . well, not exactly) . . . but there was no happy ending for this Robin & Marion either.Very well created & highly recommended viewing, definitely a classic. Personally I liked the first Robin of the Hood (Michael Praed), but the writers of this series were quite successful in introducing the new Robin of the Hood (Jason Connery) for this second set (no easy task).",5,Richard Carpenter's Robin of Sherwood- Set 2,1279152000,"07 15, 2010",2010,1804,"['first', 'episodes', 'Richard', 'Carpenter', 'Robin', 'Sherwood', 'came', 'out', 'early', '1980', 'public', 'broadcasting', 't.v', 'were', 'AWESOME', 'story', 'line', 'characters', 'were', 'rich', 'complelling', 'especially', 'liked', 'Michael', 'Praed', 'Robin', 'Loxley', 'acting', 'abilities', 'gave', 'flair', 'character', 'was', 'nice', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'Judi', 'Trott', 'Marion', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'when', 'series', 'killed', 'Robin', 'finale.But', 'series', 'was', 'continued', 'hunter', 'new', 'champion', 'Robert', 'Huntington', 'Jason', 'Connery', 'son', 'Earl', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'Robin', 'Loxley', 'left', 'off', 'Robert', 'initally', 'Herne', 'saying', 'could', 'never', 'take', 'Robin', 'place', 'Hooded', 'Man', 'when', 'Marion', 'Judi', 'Trott', 'kidnapped', 'evil', 'Lord', 'Owen', 'Clun', 'faced', 'task', 'finding', 'rest', 'band', 'help', 'free', 'mission', 'together', 'group', 'Robert', 'not', 'former', 'leader', 'still', 'goodness', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'Marion', 'still', 'former', 'husband', 'Roberts', 'obvious', 'interest', 'reluctant', 'give', 'heart', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'break', 'finale', 'was', 'awesome', 'Marion', 'heart', 'Robin', 'who', 'will', 'NEVER', 'leave', 'evil', 'Gulmar', 'Richard', ""O'Brian"", 'monsterous', 'creation', 'intent', 'killing', 'Herne', 'Hunter', 'cliff-hanger', 'yet', 'thankfully', 'writers', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'kill', 'Robin', 'off', 'well', 'not', 'exactly', 'was', 'happy', 'ending', 'Robin', 'Marion', 'either.Very', 'well', 'created', 'highly', 'recommended', 'viewing', 'definitely', 'classic', 'Personally', 'liked', 'first', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Michael', 'Praed', 'writers', 'series', 'were', 'quite', 'successful', 'introducing', 'new', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Jason', 'Connery', 'second', 'set', 'easy', 'task']",Robin of Sherwood: Set Two
1078798,A2CVP31XTYSZFE,B000R349K2,"Celia Hayes ""Sgt. Mom""","[1, 2]","The tales of Robin Hood and his merry band of outlaws have had popular appeal for centuries. Books, movies and TV series about them have turned up pretty regularly for decades. This is the 1980s iteration, with Robin and Marian, Little John and  Will Scarlet and all.This set comprises the final 13 episodes of a series which originally ran for three seasons. The first two starred Michael Praed as Robin of Loxey, a commoner who obeyed the summons of the forest-spirit Herne the Hunter. He gathered the original band of outlaws and defended the interests of the poor and dispossessed against the greed of the nobility, represented by the Sheriff of Nottingham, until he was cornered and killed. This series picks up with the summoning of Robert of Huntingdon, the son of a powerful noble, to take up the mantle... or hood, as it were. Initially reluctant, Robert (played by Jason Connery) obeys Herne and reassembles the far-scattered band, rescues Marian from the clutches of a semi-barbaric Lord Owen of Clun and embarks on a series of adventures as exciting as they are historically improbable. I am sure that any  medieval scholars watching this series are probably gibbering incoherently over some of the plot devices, but then it's not a show for them; it's a show for the rest of us, all fantastical derring-do, lots of fighting, what passes for social justice,  lashings of mysticism and magic; all that and  music by the group Clannad. There was originally a lot of money spent on this series and it shows. Much of it was shot on location in Northern England, and there are lots of nice details, like the paucity of tableware, and the Sheriffs' collection of hunting birds. The castle interiors look dim and cramped; comfort and privacy are very authentically in short supply, and almost everyone appears to be grimy, rumpled and somewhat shaggy of hair. On the whole, the series has aged very well, as have the actors. But the final episode ends very abruptly and on a bittersweet note, with Marian taking refuge in holy vows. A downturn in the fortunes of the film company which produced the series made it impossible to continue, after setting up such a cliff-hanger!As suited to such a popular show, the bonus features are generous. Nearly half of the episodes have a commentary track. Two hours worth of other extras are on a separate disc, and to a fan would be worth purchasing as a stand-alone. Two documentaries feature interviews with the actors (nearly all of whom have aged as well as the series has) there is another short feature about Clannad's music, a short morning news feature done about the show, some nice behind-the-scenes footage and the usual bloopers and outtakes. There is also a short filmography for the featured actors, which should solve the puzzle of ""where the heck have I seen that face before"" for many a consumer of British imports.",4,Men not in Tights,1243123200,"05 24, 2009",2009,2877,"['tales', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'merry', 'band', 'outlaws', 'have', 'had', 'popular', 'appeal', 'centuries', 'Books', 'movies', 'TV', 'series', 'have', 'turned', 'up', 'pretty', 'regularly', 'decades', '1980s', 'iteration', 'Robin', 'Marian', 'Little', 'John', 'Will', 'Scarlet', 'all.This', 'set', 'final', '13', 'episodes', 'series', 'originally', 'ran', 'three', 'seasons', 'first', 'two', 'starred', 'Michael', 'Praed', 'Robin', 'Loxey', 'commoner', 'who', 'obeyed', 'summons', 'forest-spirit', 'Herne', 'Hunter', 'gathered', 'original', 'band', 'outlaws', 'defended', 'interests', 'poor', 'dispossessed', 'greed', 'nobility', 'represented', 'Sheriff', 'Nottingham', 'was', 'cornered', 'killed', 'series', 'up', 'summoning', 'Robert', 'Huntingdon', 'son', 'powerful', 'noble', 'take', 'up', 'mantle', 'hood', 'were', 'Initially', 'reluctant', 'Robert', 'played', 'Jason', 'Connery', 'obeys', 'Herne', 'far-scattered', 'band', 'rescues', 'Marian', 'clutches', 'semi-barbaric', 'Lord', 'Owen', 'Clun', 'embarks', 'series', 'adventures', 'exciting', 'are', 'historically', 'improbable', 'am', 'sure', 'medieval', 'scholars', 'watching', 'series', 'are', 'probably', 'gibbering', 'incoherently', 'plot', 'devices', 'then', 'not', 'show', 'show', 'rest', 'fantastical', 'derring-do', 'lots', 'fighting', 'what', 'social', 'justice', 'lashings', 'mysticism', 'magic', 'music', 'group', 'Clannad', 'was', 'originally', 'lot', 'money', 'spent', 'series', 'Much', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'Northern', 'England', 'are', 'lots', 'nice', 'details', 'paucity', 'tableware', 'Sheriffs', 'collection', 'hunting', 'birds', 'castle', 'interiors', 'look', 'dim', 'cramped', 'comfort', 'privacy', 'are', 'very', 'authentically', 'short', 'supply', 'almost', 'everyone', 'be', 'grimy', 'rumpled', 'somewhat', 'shaggy', 'hair', 'whole', 'series', 'aged', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'actors', 'final', 'episode', 'very', 'abruptly', 'bittersweet', 'note', 'Marian', 'taking', 'refuge', 'holy', 'vows', 'downturn', 'fortunes', 'film', 'company', 'produced', 'series', 'made', 'impossible', 'continue', 'setting', 'up', 'such', 'cliff-hanger', 'suited', 'such', 'popular', 'show', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'generous', 'Nearly', 'half', 'episodes', 'have', 'commentary', 'track', 'Two', 'hours', 'other', 'extras', 'are', 'separate', 'disc', 'fan', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'stand-alone', 'Two', 'documentaries', 'feature', 'interviews', 'actors', 'nearly', 'whom', 'have', 'aged', 'as', 'well', 'series', 'short', 'feature', 'Clannad', 'music', 'short', 'morning', 'news', 'feature', 'done', 'show', 'nice', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'usual', 'bloopers', 'outtakes', 'also', 'short', 'filmography', 'featured', 'actors', 'should', 'solve', 'puzzle', 'where', 'heck', 'have', 'seen', 'face', 'many', 'consumer', 'British', 'imports']",Robin of Sherwood: Set Two

1078801,AAG231B9RSSIN,B000R349K2,Darby,"[22, 22]","Gold Crest created a real winner in its imaginative 1984 ""Robin of Sherwood"" TV series adaptation of the Robin Hood legend.The series originally ran for 4 seasons on British TV ... seasons one and two comprise ""Part 1"" (5 disks) of Acorn Media's DVD collection, and star Michael Praed as Robin of Loxley.  Seasons three and four comprise ""Part 2"" (5 disks) of Acorn's DVD collection, and starred Jason Connery as Robert of Huntington.  After wrapping at the end of season 4, the series went into syndication, and was re-aired here in the States in the late 1980's on Showtime ... I was one of the fortunate few who not only knew about the series back then, but also owned a VCR, so I was able to tape it - although the image quality of the masters used by Showtime was depressingly mediocre.The series went on to develop a small but very loyal cult following.  The soulful Celtic-themed music by Clannad (back when they were relatively unknown), the presence of old magic and myths comes to life (Herne the Hunter, Crom Cruac, witchcraft, etc.), and excellent performances by Ray Winstone (Will Scarlet -arguably the best actor on the series), Nickolas Grace (Sheriff of Nottingham), and Michael Praed (Robin of Loxley) all combined to make for a very enjoyable and nostalgic series.  It just worked.Now, here we are 20 years later, and at long last, this little known cult series has been re-released on high-quality DVDs (hooray !), so that it can be seen and enjoyed anew - not just by it's original fans, but by a new generation of viewers as well.Recommended.",5,My favorite Robin Hood series,1195430400,"11 19, 2007",2007,1564,"['Gold', 'Crest', 'created', 'real', 'winner', 'imaginative', '1984', 'Robin', 'Sherwood', 'TV', 'series', 'adaptation', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'legend.The', 'series', 'originally', 'ran', '4', 'seasons', 'British', 'TV', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'comprise', 'Part', '1', '5', 'disks', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'DVD', 'collection', 'star', 'Michael', 'Praed', 'Robin', 'Loxley', 'Seasons', 'three', 'four', 'comprise', 'Part', '2', '5', 'disks', 'Acorn', 'DVD', 'collection', 'starred', 'Jason', 'Connery', 'Robert', 'Huntington', 'wrapping', 'end', 'season', '4', 'series', 'went', 'syndication', 'was', 're-aired', 'here', 'States', 'late', '1980', 'Showtime', 'was', 'one', 'fortunate', 'few', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'knew', 'series', 'back', 'then', 'also', 'owned', 'VCR', 'was', 'able', 'tape', 'image', 'quality', 'masters', 'used', 'Showtime', 'was', 'depressingly', 'mediocre.The', 'series', 'went', 'develop', 'small', 'very', 'loyal', 'cult', 'following', 'soulful', 'Celtic-themed', 'music', 'Clannad', 'back', 'when', 'were', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'presence', 'old', 'magic', 'myths', 'life', 'Herne', 'Hunter', 'Crom', 'Cruac', 'witchcraft', 'etc', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'Will', 'Scarlet', '-arguably', 'best', 'actor', 'series', 'Nickolas', 'Grace', 'Sheriff', 'Nottingham', 'Michael', 'Praed', 'Robin', 'Loxley', 'combined', 'make', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'nostalgic', 'series', 'just', 'worked.Now', 'here', 'are', '20', 'years', 'later', 'long', 'last', 'little', 'known', 'cult', 'series', 'been', 're-released', 'high-quality', 'DVDs', 'hooray', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'anew', 'not', 'just', 'original', 'fans', 'new', 'generation', 'viewers', 'well.Recommended']",Robin of Sherwood: Set Two

Every episode now someone says &#34;He should have been back by now.&#34;  Or during an argument someone else says &#34;He's right.&#34;  And there are episodes that still today, nearly 30 years later, make me think, &#34;What were they thinking when they made this?&#34;  BUT with all that being said, it is still Robin of Sherwood.

I was also a little disappointed that it wasn't the new Robin Hood that I had heard so much about. And that beginning of ""Roooobin Roooobin [mumble mumble] dudundadaaaaaa!"" was just too much.But as I watched the thing, I really started to fall in love with the series. The sheriff is always hatching a diabolical plan unless King John screws him over and then he's gotta turn to Robin for help. Everyone keeps breaking into the castle to rescue the rest of the cast. Jason Connery brings an innocence to the role and the rest of the cast does great work. There are moments of Hey!!! That guy! Especially with Ray Winstone and Matt Frewer who shows up as a villain in one episode. Both of whom are vastly different than their quintessential roles inSexy BeastandMax Headroom: 20 Minutes Into the Futurerespectively. There are also some great moments of medieval legends throughout the series.It also gets progressively stranger as demonic cities and golems start showing up. I'm quite sure that the original conception didn't involve crazy witches and evil children. Richard O'Brien can only play Riff Raff fromThe Rocky Horror Picture Show (Widescreen Edition)but it's fun to see him playing the demonic wizard (of course, try to watch any of his episodes without yelling ""hey Riff Raff..."" I dare you) And by the end there seems to be quite a different series coming through. Don't know how far it would have gone (probably would have fizzled out) but there was some serious Twin Peaks level of strangeness peaking through.Not a perfect series by any stretch of the imagination. It's very much trapped in the 80s. The music is very cheesy. The characters are stuck in the episodic happy ending curse. The violence is constant and bloodless. People get hit with swords. They go down and that's all you need to know about it. From today's perspective, that seems a little hypocritical; in that the series wants to show violence without consequences and after the fifth or sixth anonymous henchman goes down in any episode you start to rememberThe Venture Bros. - Season Oneand the way the Monarch's Henchmen get a lot of comedy out of their short lives.
