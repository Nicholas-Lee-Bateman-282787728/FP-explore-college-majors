I was momentarily excited to see that at least a couple of seasons were out on DVD, until I read the reviews.  I'll second what others have already said - it makes no sense to release edited episodes on DVD.  It's obvious that fans are not happy with this increasing practice.  The cover clearly says ""The Complete First Season.""  If the episodes are incomplete edited episodes, then this DVD set does not contain the complete first season.  It's actually the incomplete first season.

You got to realize that this show is not a huge hit, they knew they wouldn't sell as much as shows like Seinfeld, Sex And The City, Buffy, Cheers, M*A*S*H. So they couldn't invest tons of money in the making of this series to DVD considering the approx. amount of units they would sell.I was really happy with this release, I laughed a lot and even if the picture quality is average, the sound is correct.

You had nothing but feminist moralizing in the dialogue and plot. And you had the rah rah minorities dialog in the plot too. It is enough to make you want to hurl. ""My little open minded liberal"" . . . eeewwww. Seriously that was a line in the plot. ""I feel so sorry for the minorities  . .  . how do they get  job in this economy?"" Another stupid comment. They even short change the ""conservative viewpoint"" that they have. They try (not very hard) to have Ted Knight's character be the typical old, ""old fashioned"", outdated, dummy with the ""conservative opinion"" only for him to ""come around"" by the end of the show. But even he would have a 15 second monologue on how oppressed women were in the workplace here and there. Then you had the non-stop sometimes creepy sexual innuendo . . . . The mom is supposed to represent typical mom when it comes to sex and such talk. But what comes out of this character's mouth is shocking and kinda creepy. She has these looks too like she is staring off in space. It is weird. You have the ""dumb blond"" with sweaters so tight and jeans so tight and shorts so short and tight you don't have to guess anything about her anatomy. Even the male characters wear the typical tight jeans that guys back in that era wore--too tight. You had the gay guy playing a ""straight"" guy as a gay guy. If I am not mistaken that guy contracted AIDS while this show was in production and his ""lover"" died from AIDS. You have season one centering around a man who dressed up as a woman and they keep mentioning it and bringing it back into the shows for that season. It isn't to make fun of him. It is done in a so what that is how he is way. There are two spoiled daughters that whine all the time about ""Im an adult let me be one and "" 1) use the pill if i want to 2) work in a strip club if I want to 3) etc etc etc. It was just a joke.
