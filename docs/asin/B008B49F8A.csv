1549484,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008B49F8A,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 3]","With the best of intentions, it's almost impossible to be critical of Jennifer Gargano's short feature ""8:46."" Documenting a diverse cross section of characters on the day before, as well as the morning of, the tragic events of 9/11/2001, the film seeks to be a tribute to everyone affected by that fateful day.  It's a lofty goal for such a small picture!  Lacking any real budget and running shy of an hour, the film boasts an impressively large cast.  We meet dozens and dozens of characters (some we revisit, some we don't) for one to three minute intervals of everyday life on September Tenth.  Then everyone is reunited for the tragedy at 8:46 the next morning.  Police, Firefighters, workers in the first tower, workers in the second tower, people on the planes, relatives with family members in peril, people in neighboring areas--just about everyone gets a bit of screen time.  It's an interesting approach, but also somewhat distancing.  Gargano attempts to juggle a lot in fifty minutes.I thought the set-up of ""8:46"" was quite promising with its glimpse into the lives of its many protagonists.  Moments reminded me of the earliest scenes in Paul Greengrass' brilliant ""United 93"" where we saw mundane events unfold on the least spectacular day imaginable.  But where Greengrass chose a verite approach with a complete lack of manufactured drama or back story, Gargano wants to paint a brief picture of everyone she introduces.  Sadly, it didn't always work seamlessly.  The screenplay forces dramatic situations to happen in one or two minutes and the results often feel less than organic and even stilted.  And although the film is well constructed (despite the obvious budget constraints), some scenes really work and some really don't.It's hard to fault Gargano's goals.  These were ordinary people leading ordinary lives and the repercussions of that day went far beyond just the actual incidents.  For good intentions, I'd give ""8:46"" the highest marks.  But it was hard to connect to anyone in such a short time and the film lacks some impact for this reason.  Any representation on 9/11 will, of course, create a visceral reaction.  And yes, as the movie concludes with a musical montage and a ""we will never forget"" proclamation, it's hard not to be moved.  But  in truth, I was more emotionally invested in my own memories than of anything presented in the movie.  Gargano seems to have talent, I'd like to see what she'd do with a bigger project.  But, for me, ""8:46"" is a near miss.  A worthy effort that I wished I had loved, it's still an interesting approach.  About 3 1/2 stars.

1549486,AQ2UN38CMK119,B008B49F8A,P. Mann,"[1, 1]","This short (less than an hour) film gives us a glimpse at people killed on or affected by the September 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center. Since it is hardly necessary to review the driving force behind the plot, I'll mention the structure of the film. The first half shows us the people pre-9/11 as they go about their daily lives, leading up to the Tuesday events. So we see a Japanese man who has just arrived in New York talk to his wife and daughter. We see a teenager whose father has arranged an internship that he really does not want. We see a man be told that he is not getting the promotion that it appears he deserves. (Actually, that particular scene seemed badly written.) And there are others. The second half of the film (the shorter half) deals with the first moments after the planes reach their targets.There is no doubt in my mind that the filmmakers' hearts were in the right place. But the enormity of 9/11 seems somewhat lost here. Stalin's aphorism that a single death is a tragedy and a million a statistic seems appropriate here. In less than an hour, the film simply cannot deal with all the characters as thoroughly as it could have in a longer format. In other words, I thought the welter of characters ended up diluting the impact. Intellectually, I know the scope of the tragedy. An old friend of mine from college was in the buildings that day and did not come out. I get it. The filmmakers clearly get it. The film, however, is not as powerful as it could be.",3,"Well intentioned, to be sure, but . . .",1389139200,"01 8, 2014",2014,1501,"['short', 'less', 'hour', 'film', 'glimpse', 'people', 'killed', 'affected', 'September', '11', '2001', 'attack', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'hardly', 'necessary', 'review', 'driving', 'force', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'mention', 'structure', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'people', 'pre-9/11', 'go', 'daily', 'lives', 'leading', 'up', 'Tuesday', 'events', 'see', 'Japanese', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'arrived', 'New', 'York', 'talk', 'wife', 'daughter', 'see', 'teenager', 'father', 'arranged', 'internship', 'really', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'man', 'be', 'told', 'not', 'getting', 'promotion', 'Actually', 'particular', 'scene', 'seemed', 'badly', 'written', 'are', 'others', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'shorter', 'half', 'first', 'moments', 'planes', 'reach', 'doubt', 'mind', 'filmmakers', 'hearts', 'were', 'right', 'place', 'enormity', '9/11', 'somewhat', 'lost', 'here', 'Stalin', 'aphorism', 'single', 'death', 'tragedy', 'million', 'statistic', 'appropriate', 'here', 'less', 'hour', 'film', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'deal', 'characters', 'as', 'thoroughly', 'could', 'have', 'longer', 'format', 'other', 'words', 'thought', 'welter', 'characters', 'ended', 'up', 'diluting', 'impact', 'Intellectually', 'know', 'scope', 'tragedy', 'old', 'friend', 'mine', 'college', 'was', 'buildings', 'day', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'out', 'get', 'filmmakers', 'clearly', 'get', 'film', 'however', 'not', 'as', 'powerful', 'could', 'be']",N/A
