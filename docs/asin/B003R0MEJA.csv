1359357,A3CMDR34KFLGFX,B003R0MEJA,Reader2008,"[0, 0]","I watched Season 1 and thought to myself: ""why as a child I liked this show?""  By the end of Season 1, they added Ana Alicia and with a romance I developed an interest in the show.I ordered Season 2 last week and I am watching them now.  The DVDs do have chapters based upon the title of the episode and the DVDs are professionally produced; I am not sure what people are complaining about regarding chapters and quality.Richard - he is the J.R. Ewing of the show; he hates everybody and everybody hates him; I pretty much skip any scenes related to Richard.  I guess what really makes me hate RIchard is that he is having an affair with Melissa for part of Season 2.Lance - Fine as Hades and as dumb as a bag of rocks; none of his plans or schemes ever work.  Growing up Lance and Melissa were my favorite couple.  Now, I find Lance's laziness and stupidity repulsive.  For instance, Lance has been rich his whole life but doesn't even have any savings.  When Angela put him out one time, he had to go begging his mother for money.  Another time, he tries to beat up Cole and Cole kicks his butt.  Another time, he and Melissa try to blackmail Angela and they ended up looking like fools.  Lance is just stupid. The most upsetting scene was when Lance manhandled Melissa to get her from Cole.  It was indeed wrong of Melissa to stroke Cole's face, but Lance was wrong to throw her to the side.Cole - too boring for words.  Julia said it best though: Melissa and Cole should have just gotten married when she discovered she was pregnant.  Cole was like a puppy on the show; cute and sweet but not that interesting.  The relationship between he and Linda Caproni is just pathetic and boringVickie - her hair is way too red; at 17 she dated a 50 year old professor and this season she is dating a 40 something year old married man.  Vickie has issues.  I am glad she left the show.Chase - he is always involved in some cause; this season he insists on solving the Agretti murder to clear Cole.  In my view, the sheriff should have hired additional police force rather than keep Chase involved in the investigation for like 12 episodesEmma - I understand she is mentally challenged but I just don't see her purpose on the show.  This season Richard has hired her to work at the NEW GLOBE.Melissa - I don't know what is wrong with her.  Her whole focus in life is power and money.  She has power and money so I am not understanding why she acted so stupid for much of Season 2. Pregnant with Cole's baby; sex with Richard; stroking Cole's face while claiming she loves Lance; blackmailing Angela about the Agretti Vineyards and so forth.  Melissa promised to fulfil her father's promise of getting Falcon Crest; this makes no sense considering that the Agretti VIneyards are the equivalent of Falcon Crest.Maggie - she was cast as the everyday womnan; she bores me but she is not so bad on the show; this season she has written a screen play about her lifeJulia - her mother robbed her of her life so she turns into a criminal to try to escape her mother; she really becomes conniving in Season 3Chao-Li - he has all of this advice but yet he is a butler; if he is sooo smart why doesn't Angela make him her business associate or something?",4,The quality of the DVDs are good; I think people are buying bootleg copies!,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,3236,"['watched', 'Season', '1', 'thought', 'myself', 'why', 'child', 'liked', 'show', 'end', 'Season', '1', 'added', 'Ana', 'Alicia', 'romance', 'developed', 'interest', 'show.I', 'ordered', 'Season', '2', 'last', 'week', 'am', 'watching', 'now', 'DVDs', 'do', 'have', 'chapters', 'based', 'title', 'episode', 'DVDs', 'are', 'professionally', 'produced', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'complaining', 'regarding', 'chapters', 'quality.Richard', 'J.R.', 'Ewing', 'show', 'everybody', 'everybody', 'pretty', 'much', 'skip', 'scenes', 'related', 'Richard', 'guess', 'what', 'really', 'hate', 'RIchard', 'having', 'affair', 'Melissa', 'part', 'Season', '2.Lance', 'Fine', 'Hades', 'as', 'dumb', 'bag', 'rocks', 'none', 'plans', 'schemes', 'ever', 'work', 'Growing', 'up', 'Lance', 'Melissa', 'were', 'favorite', 'couple', 'Now', 'find', 'Lance', 'laziness', 'stupidity', 'repulsive', 'instance', 'Lance', 'been', 'rich', 'whole', 'life', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'savings', 'When', 'Angela', 'put', 'out', 'one', 'time', 'had', 'go', 'begging', 'mother', 'money', 'time', 'beat', 'up', 'Cole', 'Cole', 'butt', 'time', 'Melissa', 'try', 'blackmail', 'Angela', 'ended', 'up', 'looking', 'fools', 'Lance', 'just', 'stupid', 'most', 'upsetting', 'scene', 'was', 'when', 'Lance', 'manhandled', 'Melissa', 'get', 'Cole', 'was', 'indeed', 'wrong', 'Melissa', 'stroke', 'Cole', 'face', 'Lance', 'was', 'wrong', 'throw', 'side.Cole', 'too', 'boring', 'words', 'Julia', 'said', 'best', 'Melissa', 'Cole', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'gotten', 'married', 'when', 'discovered', 'was', 'pregnant', 'Cole', 'was', 'puppy', 'show', 'cute', 'sweet', 'not', 'interesting', 'relationship', 'Linda', 'Caproni', 'just', 'pathetic', 'boringVickie', 'hair', 'way', 'too', 'red', '17', 'dated', '50', 'year', 'old', 'professor', 'season', 'dating', '40', 'something', 'year', 'old', 'married', 'man', 'Vickie', 'issues', 'am', 'glad', 'left', 'show.Chase', 'always', 'involved', 'cause', 'season', 'solving', 'Agretti', 'murder', 'clear', 'Cole', 'view', 'sheriff', 'should', 'have', 'hired', 'additional', 'police', 'force', 'rather', 'keep', 'Chase', 'involved', 'investigation', '12', 'episodesEmma', 'understand', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'purpose', 'show', 'season', 'Richard', 'hired', 'work', 'NEW', 'GLOBE.Melissa', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'wrong', 'whole', 'focus', 'life', 'power', 'money', 'power', 'money', 'so', 'am', 'not', 'understanding', 'why', 'acted', 'so', 'stupid', 'much', 'Season', '2', 'Pregnant', 'Cole', 'baby', 'sex', 'Richard', 'stroking', 'Cole', 'face', 'claiming', 'Lance', 'blackmailing', 'Angela', 'Agretti', 'Vineyards', 'so', 'forth', 'Melissa', 'promised', 'fulfil', 'father', 'promise', 'getting', 'Falcon', 'Crest', 'sense', 'considering', 'Agretti', 'VIneyards', 'are', 'equivalent', 'Falcon', 'Crest.Maggie', 'was', 'cast', 'everyday', 'womnan', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'show', 'season', 'written', 'screen', 'play', 'lifeJulia', 'mother', 'robbed', 'life', 'criminal', 'try', 'escape', 'mother', 'really', 'conniving', 'Season', '3Chao-Li', 'advice', 'yet', 'butler', 'sooo', 'smart', 'why', ""n't"", 'Angela', 'make', 'business', 'associate', 'something']",Falcon Crest: Season 2

1359360,ASF2Z8OJR0TP3,B003R0MEJA,S. T. Peterson,"[6, 8]","The first season was slow for me. It reminded me of the first season of Dynasty. Anyway Season 2 moved along pretty well and was interesting. The problem with it was there was so much going on that they dropped/delayed two of the plots. They created the shooting of Melissa's dad and the framing of Cole. Then they just kinda dropped it and moved on to other stuff. And they did the same about Cole being the father of Melissa's baby. It was a big deal at the end of Season 1--their relationship. The baby's father was still of interest at the beginning of season two. Then they just stated it as fact, hide the baby's father's identity, and let things ride. Strange. No father fighting to see his kid. No love story between them. Nothing. Weird. Anyway per most of my other comments on the tv shows of this era I  grew up watching this show off and on. I was not a devote viewer. But I remember as a kid seeing Chase and his famil y as the ""good"" family. And Angela as the ""mean"" one. Well I watch it now and see that it is just typical 70s/80s liberal vs conservative. Communism vs capitalism, even. Angela is family oriented and a good business woman who is hated for it. Chase is the tree hugging, illegal immigrant protecting, ""anti-business"" person. But what is so weird is as Chase is built up as the hero of the story he becomes more and more arrogant and bosy--he turns into Angela. Pounding fists on tables. Demanding of the police. Threatening. Making deals behind closed doors. Etc. But on a technical note one thing I could do without in these DVDs is the commercial breaks. They interrupt the show with the announcer saying ""Falcon Crest will return"" or whatever and then instead of seeing commercials you see the FC emblem and hear the announcer stated ""And now Falcon Crest"" or whatever. Why waste our time with that. But if that keeps the costs down so we can actually see the rest of the seasons then I'll deal with it.",4,This is when this show got good,1328140800,"02 2, 2012",2012,1937,"['first', 'season', 'was', 'slow', 'reminded', 'first', 'season', 'Dynasty', 'Anyway', 'Season', '2', 'moved', 'along', 'pretty', 'well', 'was', 'interesting', 'problem', 'was', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'dropped/delayed', 'two', 'plots', 'created', 'shooting', 'Melissa', 'dad', 'framing', 'Cole', 'Then', 'just', 'kinda', 'dropped', 'moved', 'other', 'stuff', 'did', 'same', 'Cole', 'being', 'father', 'Melissa', 'baby', 'was', 'big', 'deal', 'end', 'Season', '1', 'relationship', 'baby', 'father', 'was', 'still', 'interest', 'beginning', 'season', 'two', 'Then', 'just', 'stated', 'fact', 'hide', 'baby', 'father', 'identity', 'let', 'things', 'ride', 'Strange', 'father', 'fighting', 'see', 'kid', 'love', 'story', 'Nothing', 'Weird', 'Anyway', 'most', 'other', 'comments', 'tv', 'shows', 'era', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'show', 'off', 'was', 'not', 'devote', 'viewer', 'remember', 'kid', 'seeing', 'Chase', 'famil', 'y', 'good', 'family', 'Angela', 'mean', 'one', 'Well', 'watch', 'now', 'see', 'just', 'typical', '70s/80s', 'liberal', 'vs', 'conservative', 'Communism', 'vs', 'capitalism', 'even', 'Angela', 'family', 'oriented', 'good', 'business', 'woman', 'who', 'hated', 'Chase', 'tree', 'hugging', 'illegal', 'immigrant', 'protecting', 'anti-business', 'person', 'what', 'so', 'weird', 'Chase', 'built', 'up', 'hero', 'story', 'more', 'more', 'arrogant', 'bosy', 'Angela', 'Pounding', 'fists', 'tables', 'Demanding', 'police', 'Threatening', 'Making', 'deals', 'closed', 'doors', 'Etc', 'technical', 'note', 'one', 'thing', 'could', 'do', 'DVDs', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'interrupt', 'show', 'announcer', 'saying', 'Falcon', 'Crest', 'will', 'return', 'then', 'instead', 'seeing', 'commercials', 'see', 'FC', 'emblem', 'hear', 'announcer', 'stated', 'now', 'Falcon', 'Crest', 'Why', 'waste', 'time', 'costs', 'down', 'so', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'rest', 'seasons', 'then', ""'ll"", 'deal']",Falcon Crest: Season 2
1359361,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B003R0MEJA,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[7, 8]","""Falcon Crest"" was one of the most popular night-time soap operas to ever air on network television. Like ""Peyton Place"", ""Dynasty"", and ""Knots Landing"" before it ""Falcon Crest"" told a continuing story week after week mesmerizing a nation into a fantasy world. In this instance that fantasy revolved around the rich and powerful Angela Channing who ran a winery near San Francisco, who was nearly as evil as J.R. Ewing, but who loved and protected her family at all costs. The series became the #8 rated series on primetime TV in the 1982-1983 season (thanks in no small part to ""Dallas"" being its lead-in as that show was #1), but the stories on ""Falcon Crest"" that year were exciting, involving, and at times nail-biting as most of the plot revolved around a murder. In the series' final season episode that aired on March 11, 1983 it was revealed that Angela's daughter, Julia, had committed the murder. In the final shot Julia (surrounded by family and friends) pulls out a gun as the camera pans away from the mansion and shots ring out. Just before the credits roll the scene cuts to a funeral as a coffin is lowered into the ground and viewers are left guessing all summer ""who died?"".This season features 22 uncut episodes, but there are no bonus features. With the culmination of the entire ""Dallas"" library of seasons now being made available for purchase hopefully Warner Brothers (""Dallas"" and ""Falcon Crest's"" owner) will release the remaining seasons of this wonderful soap.",5,"""The Story Continues""",1293062400,"12 23, 2010",2010,1488,"['Falcon', 'Crest', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'night-time', 'soap', 'operas', 'ever', 'air', 'network', 'television', 'Peyton', 'Place', 'Dynasty', 'Knots', 'Landing', 'Falcon', 'Crest', 'told', 'continuing', 'story', 'week', 'week', 'mesmerizing', 'nation', 'fantasy', 'world', 'instance', 'fantasy', 'revolved', 'rich', 'powerful', 'Angela', 'Channing', 'who', 'ran', 'winery', 'San', 'Francisco', 'who', 'was', 'nearly', 'as', 'evil', 'J.R.', 'Ewing', 'who', 'loved', 'protected', 'family', 'costs', 'series', 'became', '8', 'rated', 'series', 'primetime', 'TV', '1982-1983', 'season', 'thanks', 'small', 'part', 'Dallas', 'being', 'lead-in', 'show', 'was', '1', 'stories', 'Falcon', 'Crest', 'year', 'were', 'exciting', 'involving', 'times', 'nail-biting', 'most', 'plot', 'revolved', 'murder', 'series', 'final', 'season', 'episode', 'aired', 'March', '11', '1983', 'was', 'revealed', 'Angela', 'daughter', 'Julia', 'had', 'committed', 'murder', 'final', 'shot', 'Julia', 'surrounded', 'family', 'friends', 'out', 'gun', 'camera', 'away', 'mansion', 'shots', 'ring', 'out', 'Just', 'credits', 'roll', 'scene', 'cuts', 'funeral', 'coffin', 'lowered', 'ground', 'viewers', 'are', 'left', 'guessing', 'summer', 'who', 'died', '.This', 'season', 'features', '22', 'uncut', 'episodes', 'are', 'bonus', 'culmination', 'entire', 'Dallas', 'library', 'seasons', 'now', 'being', 'made', 'available', 'purchase', 'hopefully', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Dallas', 'Falcon', 'Crest', 'owner', 'will', 'release', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'wonderful', 'soap']",Falcon Crest: Season 2
