I certainly wouldn't class any of them as ""PG"".Gothica is well written, well directed, reasonable acting with a decent storyline. The sets are good, the costumes and make up excellent, there's really nothing that takes your attention away from the movie being presented by screaming ""fake"" at you when you're just getting engrossed.Queen of the Damned likewise shares the good points from Gothica while being a vampire based movie. The story here is very far fetched but spun in such a way as to be totally engrossing within the frame presented.Dreamcatcher has a more oblique storyline decent directing and average acting. It's very much a different take on the genere, but one which I thoroughly enjoyed and having watched it I'm surprised it didn't do a little better at the box office.Ghost Ship was the better storyline, but was let down in some other respects, though it had an interesting twist at the finale. This movie certainly takes the watcher into the real of ""not everything is always what it seems"".All in all a decent collection, with no movie falling into the 'B' category. Not a bad buy overall, I'd recommend it for anyone who likes the genere.",4,Nice collection of thriller/soft horror,1285545600,"09 27, 2010",2010,1311,"['movie', 'collection', 'what', 'personal', 'preferences', 'movies', 'are', 'what', ""'d"", 'describe', 'horror', 'mystery', 'thrillers', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'class', 'PG', '.Gothica', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'directed', 'reasonable', 'acting', 'decent', 'storyline', 'sets', 'are', 'good', 'costumes', 'make', 'up', 'excellent', 'really', 'nothing', 'attention', 'away', 'movie', 'being', 'presented', 'screaming', 'fake', 'when', ""'re"", 'just', 'getting', 'engrossed.Queen', 'Damned', 'likewise', 'shares', 'good', 'points', 'Gothica', 'being', 'vampire', 'based', 'movie', 'story', 'here', 'very', 'far', 'fetched', 'spun', 'such', 'way', 'be', 'totally', 'engrossing', 'frame', 'presented.Dreamcatcher', 'more', 'oblique', 'storyline', 'decent', 'directing', 'average', 'acting', 'very', 'much', 'different', 'take', 'genere', 'one', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'having', 'watched', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'little', 'better', 'box', 'office.Ghost', 'Ship', 'was', 'better', 'storyline', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'other', 'respects', 'had', 'interesting', 'twist', 'finale', 'movie', 'certainly', 'watcher', 'real', 'not', 'everything', 'always', 'what', '.All', 'decent', 'collection', 'movie', 'falling', 'B', 'category', 'Not', 'bad', 'buy', 'overall', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'genere']","4 Film Favorites: Thrillers (Dreamcatcher, Ghost Ship, Gothika, Queen of the Damned)"
1289508,A2T1VQFDNXGMAU,B002U4UZSQ,"D. Hill ""dhill757""","[0, 0]","I bought this because of Ghost Ship, a spooky film with a great cast (Gabriel Byrne, Julainne Margoils, Karl Urban), and it still holds up, though the movie it rips off, the Event Horizon is still the better film. Gothika features a great Academy Award winning performance by Haley Berry, Rober Downey Jr. is also in it before his career comeback in Iron Man. Queen of the Damned provides interest only because its lead died so tragically as the movie was released: the premise of the movie, a vampire as a rock star, well, it really isn't explored, and Dreamcatcher makes absolutely no sense at all, it has to be one of Stephen KIng's worst works.
