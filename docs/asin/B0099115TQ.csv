The PLUS:  tremendous show, great season with suspense-packed episodes!  DVD quality is pretty decent: bright colors and crisp/good images.  All in all, price asides, I commend Warner Bros for putting out this set and rescuing my household from the garbage that evening reality TV has become.  My family room is a better place to hang out because my wife and I can re-live these, and my kids get to see what a show created by talented scriptwriters looks like.  Thanks WB!!! ...Keep'em rolling...Can't wait for more sets to come out!",4,Split Season in 2--Pricey...but 100% worthwhile !!!,1348790400,"09 28, 2012",2012,641,"['gripe', 'less', 'perfect', 'review', 'Price', 'approach', 'have', 'seasons', 'split', 'two', 'PLUS', 'tremendous', 'show', 'great', 'season', 'suspense-packed', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'quality', 'pretty', 'decent', 'bright', 'colors', 'crisp/good', 'images', 'price', 'asides', 'commend', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'putting', 'out', 'set', 'rescuing', 'household', 'garbage', 'evening', 'reality', 'TV', 'become', 'family', 'room', 'better', 'place', 'hang', 'out', 'wife', 'can', 're-live', 'kids', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'show', 'created', 'talented', 'scriptwriters', 'Thanks', 'WB', ""Keep'em"", 'rolling', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'more', 'sets', 'come', 'out']",The FBI: The Third Season Part One

Now I doubt I will ever bother, what a waste of money.  Fore the money spent on these discs. I would expect top quality/The sound is OK and so is the definition, but the the colour rendition of the faces and reds is ridiculous. The faces are nearly orange and the dessert scenes are oversaturated. So are other colours.I cannot understand why these DVDs gets such good reviews.  The story lines and acting may be good, but what is the point when the colour rendition transfer is as bad as it is . It spoils the worth of watching them.  No more orders of The FBI for me. I do not who was responsible for the transfer of these series, but they did a terrible job. They want to try emulatiing a transfer of the Series ""The Virginian"" and some others I could mention, these are real quality/",3,too colourful,1353456000,"11 21, 2012",2012,1013,"['had', 'been', 'deliberating', 'long', 'time', 'buy', 'FBI', 'season', 'not', 'now', 'buying', 'am', 'sorry', 'did.Amazon', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'getting', 'very', 'quick', 'time', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'discs', 'Now', 'doubt', 'will', 'ever', 'bother', 'what', 'waste', 'money', 'money', 'spent', 'discs', 'would', 'expect', 'top', 'quality/The', 'sound', 'OK', 'so', 'definition', 'colour', 'rendition', 'reds', 'ridiculous', 'are', 'nearly', 'orange', 'dessert', 'scenes', 'are', 'oversaturated', 'are', 'other', 'colours.I', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'DVDs', 'such', 'good', 'reviews', 'story', 'lines', 'acting', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'what', 'point', 'when', 'colour', 'rendition', 'transfer', 'as', 'bad', 'worth', 'watching', 'more', 'orders', 'FBI', 'do', 'not', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'transfer', 'series', 'did', 'terrible', 'job', 'want', 'try', 'emulatiing', 'transfer', 'Series', 'Virginian', 'others', 'could', 'mention', 'are', 'real', 'quality/']",The FBI: The Third Season Part One

Now that I am watching it I find it is even better than the first two seasons. I enjoy William Reynolds in the role of Erskine's partner. The scripts and production values seem improved in season 3, and the transfer to DVD either used cleaner copies or was remastered, since these prints are very good visually. They also abandoned the rather crude animations of Washington landmarks in the opening titles that were formerly used and this results in a cleaner start to the show.Disk #2 is especially good, with a fine 2-part episode featuring Arthur Hill, and another episode I particularly enjoyed that is set in the middle of an electrical blackout that features the late Diana Hyland at the pinnacle of her loveliness. While these sets are relatively pricey, if you enjoy TV series of this era there are few better. I highly recommend this and am looking forward to season #4.",5,Getting Even Better,1353110400,"11 17, 2012",2012,988,"['Having', 'already', 'purchased', 'watched', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'F.B.I.', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'season', '3', 'Now', 'am', 'watching', 'find', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'enjoy', 'William', 'Reynolds', 'role', 'Erskine', 'partner', 'scripts', 'production', 'values', 'seem', 'improved', 'season', '3', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'either', 'used', 'cleaner', 'copies', 'was', 'remastered', 'prints', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'visually', 'also', 'abandoned', 'rather', 'crude', 'animations', 'Washington', 'opening', 'titles', 'were', 'formerly', 'used', 'results', 'cleaner', 'start', 'show.Disk', '2', 'especially', 'good', 'fine', '2-part', 'episode', 'featuring', 'Arthur', 'Hill', 'episode', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'set', 'middle', 'electrical', 'blackout', 'late', 'Diana', 'Hyland', 'pinnacle', 'loveliness', 'sets', 'are', 'relatively', 'pricey', 'enjoy', 'TV', 'series', 'era', 'are', 'few', 'better', 'highly', 'recommend', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'season', '4']",The FBI: The Third Season Part One
