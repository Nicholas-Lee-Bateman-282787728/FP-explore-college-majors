Varying between brilliant and over-the-top unbelievable.  Good seems to be losing to evil by season 2 end. Much is made of the consequences of choices, especially cliche magic has its price. Few seem to be making the right ones and  with  a millenium of continuance in some cases, even the right ones have diastrous complications.  Characters almost always make  snap short-term emotional choices even when they KNOW the logical long-range ones that would benefit themselves and their societies, usually with the wrong information fed to them by treacheous forces with effective PR. Thus the good, the bad, and the ugly seem medieval in their lack of wisdom--as did short-lived uneducated disease-ridden folks before modern days in this, the &#34;real world.&#34;  Reminds me of Washington DC.",3,Spoiler Alert (?),1401494400,"05 31, 2014",2014,965,"['Parallel-space-time', 'fantasy', 'blending', 'Stephen', 'King-like', 'Maine', 'setting', 'HAVEN', 'NEEDFUL', 'THINGS', 'containing', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'other', 'fairy-tale-and-myth-adaptations', 'reversed', 'Varying', 'brilliant', 'over-the-top', 'unbelievable', 'Good', 'be', 'losing', 'evil', 'season', '2', 'end', 'Much', 'made', 'consequences', 'choices', 'especially', 'cliche', 'magic', 'price', 'Few', 'seem', 'be', 'making', 'right', 'ones', 'millenium', 'continuance', 'cases', 'even', 'right', 'ones', 'have', 'diastrous', 'complications', 'Characters', 'almost', 'always', 'make', 'snap', 'short-term', 'emotional', 'choices', 'even', 'when', 'KNOW', 'logical', 'long-range', 'ones', 'would', 'benefit', 'societies', 'usually', 'wrong', 'information', 'fed', 'treacheous', 'forces', 'effective', 'PR', 'Thus', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'seem', 'medieval', 'lack', 'wisdom', 'did', 'short-lived', 'uneducated', 'disease-ridden', 'folks', 'modern', 'days', '34', 'real', 'world.', '34', 'Reminds', 'Washington', 'DC']",Once Upon a Time: Season 1-2
1661076,A1LPKQWRHTAHQN,B00DSOOE66,Frankie D,"[2, 3]","This is a very good series. All the fairy tale characters like Snow  White, Prince Charming and countless others are put under a curse by the evil Queen and sent into our present time and do not know who they are in a town called Storybroke. A boy named Henry finds out about this and finds his mother Emma who gave him up 10 years ago to come with him to Storybroke because she can break the curse. Of course she does not believe. The show has good action and is like Lost with a lot of flashbacks. Action is cool and it even has a lot of magic in it as well. A lot of the fairytale charactors have different roles than what we grew up on and are use to. Captian Hook arrives in the second season. Sometimes it takes people to long to do stuff because they do not believe and then some people with power hold back from taking out certain people because they have feelings. This can drag some of the stories on too long. Overall I enjoyed both seasons.",5,Cool series,1393891200,"03 4, 2014",2014,952,"['very', 'good', 'series', 'fairy', 'tale', 'characters', 'Snow', 'White', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'countless', 'others', 'are', 'put', 'curse', 'evil', 'Queen', 'sent', 'present', 'time', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'town', 'called', 'Storybroke', 'A', 'boy', 'named', 'Henry', 'out', 'mother', 'Emma', 'who', 'gave', 'up', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'come', 'Storybroke', 'can', 'break', 'curse', 'course', 'not', 'believe', 'show', 'good', 'action', 'Lost', 'lot', 'flashbacks', 'Action', 'cool', 'even', 'lot', 'magic', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'fairytale', 'charactors', 'have', 'different', 'roles', 'what', 'grew', 'up', 'are', 'use', 'Captian', 'Hook', 'second', 'season', 'people', 'long', 'do', 'stuff', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'then', 'people', 'power', 'hold', 'back', 'taking', 'out', 'certain', 'people', 'have', 'feelings', 'can', 'drag', 'stories', 'too', 'long', 'Overall', 'enjoyed', 'seasons']",Once Upon a Time: Season 1-2

I love the spin they put on all the classic fairy tales I grew up with.The only complaint I have about this purchase is season one had some difficulties playing. Most of them were minor glitches that were tolerable. Disc 4 won't play at at all! I thought it was my dvd player on my laptop but my sister says it won't play on her dvd player either.",4,Love it except some difficulties with season 1 discs,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,452,"['As', 'far', 'show', 'quality', 'writing', 'good', 'find', 'show', 'be', 'quite', 'addictive', 'love', 'spin', 'put', 'classic', 'fairy', 'tales', 'grew', 'up', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'purchase', 'season', 'one', 'had', 'difficulties', 'playing', 'Most', 'were', 'minor', 'glitches', 'were', 'tolerable', 'Disc', '4', 'wo', ""n't"", 'play', 'thought', 'was', 'dvd', 'player', 'laptop', 'sister', 'wo', ""n't"", 'play', 'dvd', 'player']",Once Upon a Time: Season 1-2
