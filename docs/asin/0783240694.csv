If you want to know what compels humanity to progress, watch this film. If you want to know how one young boy and his friends fought against tradition and broke the shackles of the commonplace and the mundane, watch this film.Meet Homer Hickam (played admirably by Jake Gyllenhaal), a typical teenager boy, just like anyone else, whose imagination is fired when he sees Sputnik, the first man made object in space sent by the Soviets, streaking brilliantly across the October sky in the October of 1957. From that day, Homer sets his mind on being a rocket scientist. But fate, it seems, has other plans for him. He lives in a small town called Coalwood in West Virginia, where, it looks as if the only way to get out of school into college is on a football scholarship. The rest of the boys, who can't play football, end up in the coalmines. The mine is supervised by Homer's father John Hickam, a veteran coal miner, basically a very good man at heart, but who values his mine and principles more than even his family. He strictly says no to Homer's rocket building, and wants him to work in the mines. However, Homer persists, backed tacitly by his iconoclastic mother, and along with his friends improves his rockets to the point where they are almost miniature versions of the real ones. Inspired by his teacher, Miss Riley who is suffering from terminal Hodgkin's disease, Homer fights against his father's principles and amidst personal tragedies and problems finally wins the first prize at the National Science Fair, which lands him dozens of scholarships to study science at the best colleges in the state. The cast of characters is perfect and the performances are superb. The musical score beautifully supports the events. A fantastic old-fashioned dash of filmmaking. You don't get to see such kinds of movies nowadays. A truly inspiring movie. It would be one you would want to show youe children. Like many others, it got lost in the craze of the hi tech and big production movies of today. See it now, and you will cherish it forever.October Sky is based on a true story which makes you believe in the kind of people and situations that contribute to the progress of humanity, propelled on by their dreams in the face of opposition. Its one of the most touching movies I have ever seen. I have to admit that it brings a tear to my eyes almost everytime I see it. That's because I think that it represents human determination and achievement at its most innocent and honest level, and that is an overwhelming feeling. Moreover, &quot;reaching the stars&quot; is something which man has dreamt of perhaps since he lived in caves. Men like Homer Hickam make this eternal and extraordinary dream a great reality. Also a great example of the kind of people who want to pursue the American Dream. Its also touching for me because I think that somewhere, in this utilitarian world, those aspirations have been lost, or at least cloaked beyond recognition in materialistic ambitions. I believe that the 1950s was probably the last decade when everyone thought that simple, honest hard-work was the key to greatness, and that in fact was and always will be the case. Unfortunately, today, everything comes too easily to us. I hope with all my heart that we are wise and prescient enough not to let the Homer Hickams among us get smothered by false ambition and the devious glitter of the future...",5,One of the best movies ever made...,1032652800,"09 22, 2002",2002,3464,"['want', 'know', 'what', 'scientists', 'watch', 'film', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'humanity', 'progress', 'watch', 'film', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'one', 'young', 'boy', 'friends', 'fought', 'tradition', 'broke', 'shackles', 'commonplace', 'mundane', 'watch', 'film.Meet', 'Homer', 'Hickam', 'played', 'admirably', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'typical', 'teenager', 'boy', 'just', 'anyone', 'else', 'imagination', 'fired', 'when', 'Sputnik', 'first', 'man', 'made', 'object', 'space', 'sent', 'Soviets', 'streaking', 'brilliantly', 'October', 'sky', 'October', '1957', 'day', 'Homer', 'mind', 'being', 'rocket', 'scientist', 'fate', 'other', 'plans', 'small', 'town', 'called', 'Coalwood', 'West', 'Virginia', 'where', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'school', 'college', 'football', 'scholarship', 'rest', 'boys', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'play', 'football', 'end', 'up', 'coalmines', 'mine', 'supervised', 'Homer', 'father', 'John', 'Hickam', 'veteran', 'coal', 'miner', 'basically', 'very', 'good', 'man', 'heart', 'who', 'mine', 'more', 'even', 'family', 'strictly', 'Homer', 'rocket', 'building', 'work', 'mines', 'However', 'Homer', 'backed', 'tacitly', 'iconoclastic', 'mother', 'friends', 'rockets', 'point', 'where', 'are', 'almost', 'miniature', 'versions', 'real', 'ones', 'Inspired', 'teacher', 'Miss', 'Riley', 'who', 'suffering', 'terminal', 'Hodgkin', 'disease', 'Homer', 'fights', 'father', 'principles', 'amidst', 'personal', 'tragedies', 'problems', 'finally', 'first', 'prize', 'National', 'Science', 'Fair', 'dozens', 'scholarships', 'study', 'science', 'best', 'colleges', 'state', 'cast', 'characters', 'perfect', 'performances', 'are', 'superb', 'musical', 'score', 'beautifully', 'events', 'fantastic', 'old-fashioned', 'dash', 'filmmaking', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'such', 'kinds', 'movies', 'nowadays', 'truly', 'inspiring', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'would', 'want', 'show', 'youe', 'children', 'many', 'others', 'got', 'lost', 'craze', 'hi', 'tech', 'big', 'production', 'movies', 'today', 'See', 'now', 'will', 'cherish', 'forever.October', 'Sky', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'believe', 'kind', 'people', 'situations', 'contribute', 'progress', 'humanity', 'propelled', 'dreams', 'face', 'opposition', 'one', 'most', 'touching', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'have', 'admit', 'tear', 'eyes', 'almost', 'everytime', 'see', 'think', 'human', 'determination', 'achievement', 'most', 'innocent', 'honest', 'level', 'overwhelming', 'feeling', 'Moreover', 'quot', 'reaching', 'stars', 'quot', 'something', 'man', 'dreamt', 'perhaps', 'lived', 'caves', 'Men', 'Homer', 'Hickam', 'make', 'eternal', 'extraordinary', 'dream', 'great', 'reality', 'Also', 'great', 'example', 'kind', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'pursue', 'American', 'Dream', 'also', 'touching', 'think', 'somewhere', 'utilitarian', 'world', 'aspirations', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'least', 'cloaked', 'recognition', 'materialistic', 'ambitions', 'believe', '1950s', 'was', 'probably', 'last', 'decade', 'when', 'everyone', 'thought', 'simple', 'honest', 'hard-work', 'was', 'key', 'greatness', 'fact', 'was', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'case', 'Unfortunately', 'today', 'everything', 'too', 'easily', 'hope', 'heart', 'are', 'wise', 'prescient', 'enough', 'not', 'let', 'Homer', 'Hickams', 'get', 'smothered', 'false', 'ambition', 'devious', 'glitter', 'future']",N/A

It's 1957, and Homer Hickman is just a regular high school teen living in a small West Virginia town where his father is the manager of the coal mine that employs, well, everyone.  As we meet Homer, he is working, not very successfully, to deal with the usual plagues of youth...how to get the the girl of your dreams, how to be noticed while walking in the shadow of a sports hero older brother, how to gain attention and respect from his father, and so on...just about then it is announced that the Soviets had launched Sputnik!The space age had arrived!The specter of Sputnik orbiting overhead has a profound influence on Homer...he is captivated by the idea of space and rocketry.  He becomes the heart and soul of a group of four HS students who start to dabble in making model rockets of their own...much to his father's chagrin.You will sorrow with Homer and his friends in their setbacks, and revel with them in their successes.  Laura Dern plays a pivotal role as a teacher who encourages the boys to continue their experiments.  Before long the whole town in caught up in their launches.You'll love the way that Homer explains to the sherrif, in front of his class, why one of his rockets couldn't possibly have been responsible for starting a forest fire in the area...classic!If you haven't seen this show, watch it!  It's well worth your time.As another reviewer aptly pointed out, this is a great film about teens...the teens look and act like teens.

68960,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,0783240694,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[10, 10]","Overlooked by the Academy Awards and most of the movie viewing public, October Sky turned out to be one of the best movies of 1999. Based on the true life story of Homer Hickman, a coalminer's son inspired to learn about rocketry following the launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik, October Sky is more than just a film about rockets, it's a film about one man overcoming the trials and tribulations that attempt to run him down. The emphasis placed on the passion of the human spirit and its ability to overcome great conflict and achieve feats of wondrous heights makes October Sky a film that is certain to enjoy an enduring legacy and a heightening in stature among critics with the passing of time...Set in a 1950s West Virginia town, October Sky follows the life of Homer Hickman (Jake Gyllenhaal), the teenage son of a coalminer who pushes his son to follow in his footsteps. Growing up in a town where coal is king, the citizens of Homer's world can't fathom pursuing a career in any other field. But when Homer's classroom is informed of the Soviet launch of Sputnik, the satellite inspires Homer to learn everything he can about rockets, satellites, and inner-orbiting spacecraft. Goaded on by their teacher Frieda Riley (Laura Dern), Homer and his friends study the various aspects of a rocket launch and begin staging the launch of their own homemade rockets. But their trial and error experiments go awry, putting the local townspeople in the path of their errant rocket launches, and they incur the wrath and disdain of a community that views them as freaks and outcasts.As Homer's father becomes ill from the deadly effects of coal dust, he pushes his son to support the family by entering the mine. Unable to see the bright potential of his son's interest in rockets, John Hickman (Chris Cooper) battles Homer every step of the way as he pursues his passion. But Homer remains committed, and when he and his friends begin launching rockets from a new site outside of town, more and more people begin showing up to see the brilliant spectacle... When Homer's hero, German rocket scientist and NASA engineer Wernher von Braun, replies to a letter Homer wrote, the path is cleared for the students to exhibit their work at the National Science Awards.Encouraged by Miss Riley, Homer and his friends are prepared to put their entire future on the line at this one exhibition, where the prize includes fully paid scholarships to some of the top universities in America...The inspiring tale of a boy and his friends who never give up on believing in themselves, October Sky is a feel-good movie reminiscent of Jimmy Stewart and Frank Capra. Outside of the traditional mold of action super-thriller or blood-spilling reality drama, October Sky bucks the trend of cinematic commercialism by offering its audience a more intelligent foray into the world of film and storytelling. This trend toward quality cinematography is one we can only hope will continue. Sporting a colorful cast of characters rife with conflict and passion, October Sky is a definite must-see film that you won't want to miss...The DVD Report",5,A truly inspirational film...,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,3123,"['Overlooked', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'most', 'movie', 'viewing', 'public', 'October', 'Sky', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '1999', 'Based', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'Homer', 'Hickman', 'coalminer', 'son', 'inspired', 'learn', 'rocketry', 'following', 'launch', 'Soviet', 'satellite', 'Sputnik', 'October', 'Sky', 'more', 'just', 'film', 'rockets', 'film', 'one', 'man', 'overcoming', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'attempt', 'run', 'down', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'passion', 'human', 'spirit', 'ability', 'overcome', 'great', 'conflict', 'achieve', 'feats', 'wondrous', 'heights', 'October', 'Sky', 'film', 'certain', 'enjoy', 'enduring', 'legacy', 'heightening', 'stature', 'critics', 'passing', 'time', 'Set', '1950s', 'West', 'Virginia', 'town', 'October', 'Sky', 'life', 'Homer', 'Hickman', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'teenage', 'son', 'coalminer', 'who', 'son', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'Growing', 'up', 'town', 'where', 'coal', 'king', 'citizens', 'Homer', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'pursuing', 'career', 'other', 'field', 'when', 'Homer', 'classroom', 'informed', 'Soviet', 'launch', 'Sputnik', 'satellite', 'Homer', 'learn', 'everything', 'can', 'rockets', 'satellites', 'inner-orbiting', 'spacecraft', 'Goaded', 'teacher', 'Frieda', 'Riley', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'Homer', 'friends', 'study', 'various', 'aspects', 'rocket', 'launch', 'begin', 'staging', 'launch', 'own', 'homemade', 'rockets', 'trial', 'error', 'experiments', 'go', 'awry', 'putting', 'local', 'townspeople', 'path', 'errant', 'rocket', 'launches', 'incur', 'wrath', 'disdain', 'community', 'freaks', 'outcasts.As', 'Homer', 'father', 'ill', 'deadly', 'effects', 'coal', 'dust', 'son', 'support', 'family', 'entering', 'mine', 'Unable', 'see', 'bright', 'potential', 'son', 'interest', 'rockets', 'John', 'Hickman', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Homer', 'step', 'way', 'passion', 'Homer', 'committed', 'when', 'friends', 'begin', 'launching', 'rockets', 'new', 'site', 'town', 'more', 'more', 'people', 'begin', 'showing', 'up', 'see', 'brilliant', 'spectacle', 'When', 'Homer', 'hero', 'German', 'rocket', 'scientist', 'NASA', 'engineer', 'Wernher', 'von', 'Braun', 'letter', 'Homer', 'wrote', 'path', 'cleared', 'students', 'exhibit', 'work', 'National', 'Science', 'Awards.Encouraged', 'Miss', 'Riley', 'Homer', 'friends', 'are', 'prepared', 'put', 'entire', 'future', 'line', 'one', 'exhibition', 'where', 'prize', 'fully', 'paid', 'scholarships', 'top', 'universities', 'America', 'inspiring', 'tale', 'boy', 'friends', 'who', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'believing', 'October', 'Sky', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'reminiscent', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'traditional', 'mold', 'action', 'super-thriller', 'blood-spilling', 'reality', 'drama', 'October', 'Sky', 'trend', 'cinematic', 'commercialism', 'offering', 'audience', 'more', 'intelligent', 'foray', 'world', 'film', 'storytelling', 'trend', 'quality', 'cinematography', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'will', 'continue', 'Sporting', 'colorful', 'cast', 'characters', 'rife', 'conflict', 'passion', 'October', 'Sky', 'definite', 'must-see', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

Homer Hickam is a young man struggling to find his identity as he dreams about space, rockets, and getting out of the small mining town of Coalwood, West Virginia.

It has all the makings of a masterpiece; realism, great acting, a positive message, and it's entertaining.Set in a small coal mining town in 1957 West Virginia, many people are saddened by the fact that the Russians launched Sputnik.  Not Homer Hickam.  Instead Homer - who starts out as a student who does not work to his full potential - gets inspired.  He and his three best friends start trying harder in school and conducting their own little rocket launches.  The boys find themselves at odds with many of the town's people - Homer's father in particular - who believe the future is in coal-mining, not rocket science.  But even with all that they are up against, Homer and his friends refuse to give up.Living not far from West Virginia, I can honestly say that these characters were realistic and complex.  There were no villains, only people with differing viewpoints.  I especially liked how the teenagers were portrayed.  So many movies and TV shows treat teenagers as if they only think about sex, fashion, partying, etc.  In OCTOBER SKY, the teenagers have more substantial goals and feelings - like avoiding a future, or lack thereof, in the coal mines.I not only recommend OCTOBER SKY, in fact I urge people to watch it.  Even with the light profanity, I can't think of a better movie for kids to watch.  This is a movie that should be showed in schools because of its message to do your best no matter how bad things look.",5,It will take a rocket engine to pull you away from this one.,997056000,"08 6, 2001",2001,1667,"['are', 'getting', 'tired', 'movies', 'have', 'heroes', 'who', 'are', 'judged', 'sense', 'fashion', 'rather', 'ethics', 'prevailing', 'Tom', 'Green/American', 'Pie', 'style', 'toilet', 'humor', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'OCTOBER', 'SKY', 'makings', 'masterpiece', 'realism', 'great', 'acting', 'positive', 'message', 'entertaining.Set', 'small', 'coal', 'mining', 'town', '1957', 'West', 'Virginia', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'saddened', 'fact', 'Russians', 'launched', 'Sputnik', 'Not', 'Homer', 'Hickam', 'Instead', 'Homer', 'who', 'out', 'student', 'who', 'not', 'work', 'full', 'potential', 'inspired', 'three', 'best', 'friends', 'start', 'trying', 'harder', 'school', 'conducting', 'own', 'little', 'rocket', 'launches', 'boys', 'find', 'odds', 'many', 'town', 'people', 'Homer', 'father', 'particular', 'who', 'believe', 'future', 'coal-mining', 'not', 'rocket', 'science', 'even', 'are', 'up', 'Homer', 'friends', 'refuse', 'give', 'up.Living', 'not', 'far', 'West', 'Virginia', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'characters', 'were', 'realistic', 'complex', 'were', 'villains', 'only', 'people', 'differing', 'viewpoints', 'especially', 'liked', 'how', 'teenagers', 'were', 'portrayed', 'So', 'many', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'treat', 'teenagers', 'only', 'think', 'sex', 'fashion', 'partying', 'etc', 'OCTOBER', 'SKY', 'teenagers', 'have', 'more', 'substantial', 'goals', 'feelings', 'avoiding', 'future', 'lack', 'thereof', 'coal', 'mines.I', 'not', 'only', 'recommend', 'OCTOBER', 'SKY', 'fact', 'urge', 'people', 'watch', 'Even', 'light', 'profanity', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'better', 'movie', 'kids', 'watch', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'showed', 'schools', 'message', 'do', 'best', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'things', 'look']",N/A

Akston""","[6, 6]","While I do not see too many films when they are released in theaters, I raced out to catch this one because it seemed to carry such an inspiring message. I'll never forget the mamazing feeling in my heart when I left the movie theater that evening. I could not help but stare up into the sky, feeling like I could reach out and grab the stars.Jake Gyllenhaal perfectly captures the essence of Homer Hickam. While the movie is heavy on melodrama, its perfectly necessary to get the message across. The life that was laid in front of Homer when he was born was not a pleasant one. He was going to work in the mines. His father knew, as did the whole town. But Homer doesn't accept this and his mother and teacher make sure that he does not quit.Chris Cooper is unbelievable. I had not seen his previous work and had no idea who he was. After October Sky I pledged to never miss one of his films, and have yet to be disappointed.The directing is a littleover-the-top and the screenplay had to do a lot of strecthing to make the movie accessible, but these changes do not detract from the story, they enhance it. Two scenes capture how this works. The &quot;Rocket Boys&quot; have been struggling with their propellant for a long time and can't get it right. Finally, they chance upon a solution that might work and when they got to test it, the entire high school and half the town is there to watch. Horrified at the prospect of screwing up in front of the entire town, Homer realizes he has no choice; he can't back down now. When the fuse is lit and the rocket soars perfectly into the sky, you heart swells with pride for what these boys accomplished.And the final scene between Homer and his father still chokes me up as I think about it now. Homer has his speech where he thanks everyone and to his surprise, there is his father, who he invites to press the button to send the last rocket airborne. As his father watches the rocket fly, even he is impressed by what his son accomplishes and he lovingly puts his arm around his shoulders. A beautifully shot scene.Now did these scenes happen exactly like this? The book shows us that they did not. But that doesn't matter. The art of film and the art of writing are completely different. The scenes are precisely what they need to be to put the message across visually. The emotions that these images provoke are visceral, and that is why the movie is so powerful.The supporting cast are wonderfully understated, especially Laura Dern and Chris Owen. The movies beutifully shot and the screenplay is a nice adaptation of a book that is difficult to visualize. Thank you to all involved for giving me a movie that makes me cry every time I watch.

The big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his dad, which I think was overdone. I would like to have a little less tension between the two.The young man, still a boy, is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, one of his first staring assignments, I think.

There is fear, doubt, and uncertainty, along with the roadblocks and setbacks life throws in your way via family responsibilities, health, and the jealousy and ignorance of others.And it shows the vital role of friendship, mutual support, and the belief of authority figures (the mother and the teacher) in finding a path to success in reaching our goals and dreams.  I find the relationship between the father and Homer particularly painful and am always happy to hear Homer finally tell his father that von Braun isn't his hero, that he is.  Jake Gyllenhall and Chris Cooper portray this loving but painful relationship very well.The Dad (the always great Chris Cooper) just wants to protect his family.  He has a world view limited by a harsh life and he has achieved some success in that world.  He wants to protect Homer and help him find his way in that world.  Homer has his views opened to something beyond Coalville and his father finds this to be wishful thinking and wasted dreaming without a chance of ever coming true.The movie is inspiring with moments of real fun and sorrow.  I think it is a great movie to watch with your kids and then talk over with them.  They will see things you don't and you can help them see things that they wouldn't otherwise see until they become responsible adults.I am glad that at the end of the movie they tell us how each of the Rocket Boys found their way in life.

It speaks about a boy and his dream to build a rocket in a most ordinary part of America. The boys do look like just ordinary American kids which is why this movie appeals me even more. This is not like a soap opera. The charm of this movie lies in its simplicity. A sweetness and innocence is written all over it. It is bound to remind you about your high school life. Very small, insignificant moments which we never witness in regular movies shown in the film makes it feel as if we are watching our young ages. In some beautiful passages, this film almost replays man's journey with science and technology, where failure has been a constant threat, still man went ahead to conquer the unknown.Only one thing I felt could have made the ending even better is pushing the scope little further. What does our study teach us? Just the tools to get a job? Surely not. Study or education teaches us to solve all challenges we come across in life, to find answers to all questions that life keeps asking us. May be our parents and elders have found the answers before us, but we have to find these again for us. We cannot keep looking to parents for answers. In that sense, even after we leave college, our student life does not end. Life is itself like an examination, where  questions are all unknown and unseen, there is no single book like 'Principles of Guided Missile Design' which we can look to for answers. It is we ourselves who have to do our own research to find a proper answer. That is the best fruit of education, like the mission of these boys to win the National Science Fair. The endeavor of the boys just did not help them to win the Fair, but the confidence and character to face any challenge in life - even of student life. That is the best blessing of having education.

Based on a true story - ROCKET BOYS by Homer. H. Hickam, Jr. - it is everything young people should see to remind them that dreams are indeed possible.  The story takes place in the little mining town of Coalwood, West Virginia in 1957 when all eyes were focused on the seemingly unreal launching of Russia's Sputnik.  Homer, Jr. (Jake Gyllenhaal, with all of his innate charm intact even then!) longs to get away from his presumed destiny of working in the coalmines upon graduation from high school.  But Homer's ideals are higher and with the aid of his friends he designs and launches a little rocket that at first angers his miner father (Chris Cooper) but excites his teacher (Laura Dern), who assists Homer in his dreams of rising above the frustrating level of his life in the little town to accomplish dreams he never thought possible.There is just the right amount of tender humor, status resistance, and recreation of a period of time in our history when suddenly everything was possible if a rocket could place a satellite in orbit and transmit signals to the earth.  For those of us who lived it this film is an enriching memory, and for those who didn't witness it, the film offers a true sense of the possibilities of the open human spirit.

It took a lot of gall for Homer and his friends to be able to grow into manhood without falling in the trap of a prefabricated future that runs from father to son, to be a miner in the local mine and never get out of that fate. It took also three different challenges for Homer and his friends to conquer a personal and free future. The challenge of the first ever man-made artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, a Soviet satellite, a milestone in human history, a turning point that Homer and his friends could not miss, did not want to miss. Then the challenge of science and applied mechanics to calculate and to devise a rocket from scratch or rather from what they could gather in books and order in their minds. Finally the challenge of a world that resists and refuses and tries to force you back into the pack, even with an untimely accident that forces you to get back into the pack for plain survival necessity, and even then Homer proved he had the guts to accept the challenge that was blocking for a while his own plans and dreams. But there is another side of the story that the film does not emphasize enough. Homer is the carrier of the project but he is also the carrier of the inspiration he and his friends need. If he is the one who is going to get the university scholarship, because his friends gave him precedence, his friends will also be able to get on their own roads and tracks and step out of the mining fate, thanks to the energy his inspiring example sets in front of their eyes. It is hard at times not to follow the example of the one who is like a beacon on a difficult road. But the film is also effective to show how the father resisted this dream because for him science was not the fabric of a true man, like mining or football. The working class fate that was so present in those 1950s and 1960s and still is present in some areas is too often enforced by the traditional thinking of the father. If the mother does not have the courage to speak up one day, the working class fate I am speaking of becomes a tremendous trap. Here too the film is effective and it should make some parents think. This might have been the fourth challenge Homer had to face: the challenge of taking a road that was not the one pointed at and programmed by his own father.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",5,From Western Virginia coal mines to NASA,1180828800,"06 3, 2007",2007,2454,"['simple', 'effective', 'film', 'what', 'life', 'responding', 'challenges', 'took', 'lot', 'gall', 'Homer', 'friends', 'be', 'able', 'grow', 'manhood', 'falling', 'trap', 'prefabricated', 'future', 'father', 'son', 'be', 'miner', 'local', 'mine', 'never', 'get', 'fate', 'took', 'also', 'three', 'different', 'challenges', 'Homer', 'friends', 'conquer', 'personal', 'free', 'future', 'challenge', 'first', 'ever', 'man-made', 'artificial', 'satellite', 'Sputnik', '1', 'Soviet', 'satellite', 'milestone', 'human', 'history', 'turning', 'point', 'Homer', 'friends', 'could', 'not', 'miss', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'miss', 'Then', 'challenge', 'science', 'applied', 'mechanics', 'calculate', 'devise', 'rocket', 'scratch', 'rather', 'what', 'could', 'gather', 'books', 'order', 'minds', 'Finally', 'challenge', 'world', 'refuses', 'tries', 'force', 'back', 'pack', 'even', 'untimely', 'accident', 'get', 'back', 'pack', 'plain', 'survival', 'necessity', 'even', 'then', 'Homer', 'proved', 'had', 'guts', 'accept', 'challenge', 'was', 'blocking', 'while', 'own', 'plans', 'dreams', 'side', 'story', 'film', 'not', 'emphasize', 'enough', 'Homer', 'carrier', 'project', 'also', 'carrier', 'inspiration', 'friends', 'need', 'one', 'who', 'going', 'get', 'university', 'scholarship', 'friends', 'gave', 'precedence', 'friends', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'own', 'roads', 'tracks', 'step', 'out', 'mining', 'fate', 'thanks', 'energy', 'inspiring', 'example', 'sets', 'front', 'eyes', 'hard', 'times', 'not', 'follow', 'example', 'one', 'who', 'beacon', 'difficult', 'road', 'film', 'also', 'effective', 'show', 'how', 'father', 'resisted', 'dream', 'science', 'was', 'not', 'fabric', 'true', 'man', 'mining', 'football', 'working', 'class', 'fate', 'was', 'so', 'present', '1950s', '1960s', 'still', 'present', 'areas', 'too', 'often', 'enforced', 'traditional', 'thinking', 'father', 'mother', 'not', 'have', 'courage', 'speak', 'up', 'one', 'day', 'working', 'class', 'fate', 'am', 'speaking', 'becomes', 'tremendous', 'trap', 'Here', 'too', 'film', 'effective', 'should', 'make', 'parents', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'fourth', 'challenge', 'Homer', 'had', 'face', 'challenge', 'taking', 'road', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'pointed', 'programmed', 'own', 'father.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne']",N/A

Many of us weren't motivated to go out and spring for the price of a movie ticket, but it's still available from Amazon, right? Well, THIS time, don't miss it!When Sputnik was launched in 1957, the whole world was riveted by the event. A small coal-mining town in West Virginia was no different. A teenage boy, played by Jake Gyllenhaal (""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Proof""), transfixed by the sight of that tiny light streaking across the October sky, was a kid named Homer Hickam, Jr. He and two other pals hung out, tried to date girls, made medium grades and generally were grooming themselves to follow in their fathers' footsteps into the coal mines. The sight of Sputnik exploded the size of Homer's universe. He decided he wanted to fire off rockets to see how it was done. He and the other two boys suffered through a series of failures which began when he blew up the fence around his mother's cherished rose garden.They finally recruited the class ""geek"" to help them with the more challenging mathematics that seemed to be required. You will have the pleasure of seeing these four boys develop the necessary skills, enjoy encouragement from a science teacher (and DIScouragement from the school principal), make spectacular errors and generally act like normal teenagers who are flirting with a dream. The teacher, played by Laura Dern (""Wild at Heart"" and ""Rambling Rose"") tells Homer that he could get a college scholarship if he won the science fair, and she thinks he and his friends might be on the right track. Homer persists, despite resistance from his father, played by Chris Cooper (""Adaptation"" and ""Lone Star""), who wants him to play football and get a scholarship THAT way, like his brother.Homer writes a fan letter to Werner von Braun, which, to his surprise, gets him a signed 8 X 10 photo.This story has amusing bits, the family conflict bits, the awkward adolescent bits, the hazardous mining bits, and then the BIG setback. The movie serves all of them without a hitch. It captures the sense of a dying one-company mining town, owned by the coal company, lock, stock and barrel. Even the school teachers were employees of the mines. The miners' homes, the stores, everything, belonged to the company! By the time of the big miners' strike in 1959, which was nationwide and included my husband's job in the copper mines of Bisbee, Arizona, it was clear that, like many other mining towns, the little West Virginia town was doomed. We know that that way of life was also doomed. This was a time when people never locked their doors; car keys were left in the ignition; no one expected or experienced any thievery. When Homer goes to Indianapolis to participate in a science fair, he doesn't realize he has to secure the important elements of his display and is absolutely thunder- struck when he comes into the area the next morning and finds it has been cleaned out!You will LOVE the sound track.

69029,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,0783240694,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[17, 18]","There are too many movies about prestigious people making it big.  I am very happy that one person in a million was able to make it as a country star or rock star for whatever reason.  However, I am neither.  Neither am I famous.  This movie is for people like me who can identify with the difficulties of changing the course of their lives and become engineers, doctors, lawyers, teachers or any of the other seemingly mundane jobs that may ultimately change our lives and just possibly our country.Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a teenager in the coal town of Coalwood, West Virginia in 1957.  The only generally accepted way to get out of Coalwood was to get a football scholarship.  Homer is too small to be in football.  However, Homer is smart and John Hickam (Chris Cooper) hopes that Homer can learn enough to replace him in the mine some day.Miss Frieda Riley (Laura Dern) is a school teacher who left Coalwood to become a teacher, and now she hopes to inspire others to do the same.  After Homer and many of the townspeople watch Sputnik fly through the night sky, Homer decides to build a rocket.  Miss Riley suggests that Homer might enter his rocket in the science fair, perhaps ultimately obtaining a scholarship.Homer gathers three of his friends and tries to give them the same enthusiasm he has for building rockets.  Soon their experiments go from disaster to success, and back to disaster again as the State Police accuse the boys of starting a forest fire.  Things are looking grim until the boys determine that their rockets could not possibly have started the fire.  Back in school again, the boys quickly recover from the disaster to win their local, county and state science fairs, and move on to the national science fair in Indianapolis.  I leave the rest of the story for viewers.Homer and the other boys were likely going to end up in the coal mines of Coalwood.  The boys' teacher inspired them to reach for something better, and with a lot of ambition and personal sacrifice, the boys made their parents, their town and themselves proud.  Much of this movie was about the interaction between Homer and his father.  John Hickam thought Homer had a lot of capability, but as many fathers do, John was not thinking big enough for Homer.  There are a couple of key scenes in this movie that send chills down my back because I recognized the respect that Homer had for his father, and the difficulty his father had in seeing that respect.  John Hickam was Homer Hickam's hero, and he always will be.This movie is rated PG for mild language, alcohol use, and mild violence, but I think this is movie is suitable for everyone in the family with a minimal amount of parental explanation and guidance.  My children first saw this movie as teens, and both liked the movie, especially my son.This movie won three major awards and was nominated for nine others.  It deserved to win more than it did.I enjoyed this movie because it was about every day people overcoming their life circumstances to achieve something better than what their parents would have anticipated.  We work with those people, we know those people, and we are those people.  Watch this movie; you will recognize the characters and you will enjoy it.",5,"Inspiring, Family Friendly Story",1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,3241,"['are', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'prestigious', 'people', 'making', 'big', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'one', 'person', 'million', 'was', 'able', 'make', 'country', 'star', 'rock', 'star', 'reason', 'However', 'am', 'neither', 'am', 'famous', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'identify', 'difficulties', 'changing', 'course', 'lives', 'become', 'engineers', 'doctors', 'lawyers', 'teachers', 'other', 'seemingly', 'mundane', 'jobs', 'may', 'ultimately', 'change', 'lives', 'just', 'possibly', 'country.Homer', 'Hickam', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'teenager', 'coal', 'town', 'Coalwood', 'West', 'Virginia', '1957', 'only', 'generally', 'accepted', 'way', 'get', 'Coalwood', 'was', 'get', 'football', 'scholarship', 'Homer', 'too', 'small', 'be', 'football', 'However', 'Homer', 'smart', 'John', 'Hickam', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Homer', 'can', 'learn', 'enough', 'replace', 'mine', 'day.Miss', 'Frieda', 'Riley', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'left', 'Coalwood', 'become', 'teacher', 'now', 'inspire', 'others', 'do', 'same', 'Homer', 'many', 'townspeople', 'watch', 'Sputnik', 'night', 'sky', 'Homer', 'build', 'rocket', 'Miss', 'Riley', 'Homer', 'might', 'enter', 'rocket', 'science', 'fair', 'perhaps', 'ultimately', 'obtaining', 'scholarship.Homer', 'gathers', 'three', 'friends', 'tries', 'give', 'same', 'enthusiasm', 'building', 'rockets', 'Soon', 'experiments', 'go', 'disaster', 'success', 'back', 'disaster', 'again', 'State', 'Police', 'boys', 'starting', 'forest', 'fire', 'Things', 'are', 'looking', 'grim', 'boys', 'determine', 'rockets', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'have', 'started', 'fire', 'Back', 'school', 'again', 'boys', 'quickly', 'recover', 'disaster', 'win', 'local', 'county', 'state', 'science', 'fairs', 'move', 'national', 'science', 'fair', 'Indianapolis', 'leave', 'rest', 'story', 'viewers.Homer', 'other', 'boys', 'were', 'likely', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'coal', 'mines', 'Coalwood', 'boys', 'teacher', 'inspired', 'reach', 'something', 'better', 'lot', 'ambition', 'personal', 'sacrifice', 'boys', 'made', 'parents', 'town', 'proud', 'Much', 'movie', 'was', 'interaction', 'Homer', 'father', 'John', 'Hickam', 'thought', 'Homer', 'had', 'lot', 'capability', 'many', 'fathers', 'do', 'John', 'was', 'not', 'thinking', 'big', 'enough', 'Homer', 'are', 'couple', 'key', 'scenes', 'movie', 'send', 'chills', 'down', 'back', 'recognized', 'respect', 'Homer', 'had', 'father', 'difficulty', 'father', 'had', 'seeing', 'respect', 'John', 'Hickam', 'was', 'Homer', 'Hickam', 'hero', 'always', 'will', 'be.This', 'movie', 'rated', 'PG', 'mild', 'language', 'alcohol', 'use', 'mild', 'violence', 'think', 'movie', 'suitable', 'everyone', 'family', 'minimal', 'amount', 'parental', 'explanation', 'guidance', 'children', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'teens', 'liked', 'movie', 'especially', 'son.This', 'movie', 'won', 'three', 'major', 'awards', 'was', 'nominated', 'nine', 'others', 'deserved', 'win', 'more', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'day', 'people', 'overcoming', 'life', 'circumstances', 'achieve', 'something', 'better', 'what', 'parents', 'would', 'have', 'anticipated', 'work', 'people', 'know', 'people', 'are', 'people', 'Watch', 'movie', 'will', 'recognize', 'characters', 'will', 'enjoy']",N/A

""October Sky"", the screen version of Homer Hickam's autobiography, ""Rocket Boys"" is just the opposite.  Joe Johnston directs a talented, and somewhat unknown cast in a beautifully paced, visually fulfilling film that yes, can be described as ""heartwarming"", without being maudlin or corny!Gifted actor/actress Chris Cooper and Laura Dern play pivotal, if small, roles in the coming of age tale of young Hickam, who developed his passion for space exploration in the Kennedy years, in West Virginia.  Austere and poor, the town of Coalwood earns its livelihood from the danger and depression that surrounds the central employer, the coal mines. Getting out of Coalwood has only been accomplished by talented football players - Hickam is not!  New find Jake Gyllenhaal, with extraordinary timing and quiet charisma, plays young Homer, with passion and humor.  Surrounding him are believable  young actors as his buddies, as they embark on the true story of discovering the hobby of rocketry, and use the hobby as a foundation for all their future hopes and dreams.  Along the way, they bring the town to life and make believers out of many, including Cooper, as Homer's father.Gyllenhaal has had limited screen exposure, but many fans are awaiting his upcoming roles in summer movies, ""Highway"" and ""The Bubble Boy"".  He demonstrates extraordinary range in his role as Homer Hickam.  Almost unnoticed, but unique, in the film is his mother, from whom the real Homer must have inherited his dreams and his vision.  A small town Mom in the 60's, she occupies her spare time by painting a mural in her kitchen!The special edition DVD has some excellent ""making the movie"" features, and the follow up spotlights on the real Homer and his family and friends are interesting and found on all versions.October Sky, although generally praised by the critics, did not reach a large audience in theaters.

69033,ASU3THM5ZUTUI,0783240694,"Mark Lee ""Peacemaker""","[3, 4]","This is the true story of Homer Hickam, who felt he was doomed to a life of coal-mining and football until in 1957 the Russian satellite Sputnik lit up the October sky one night. This inspired him to pursue a dream: to build a rocket and go into space one day. His father is a devoted coal-miner and doesn't approve of Homer's dream, but through the help of friends and his own will, Homer finally wins the National Science Fair for the ailing town of Coalwood.I was in 7th grade when I saw &quot;October Sky&quot; for the first time. After seeing it, I felt like running all the way up Mount Everest and hollering from the summit at the top of my lungs. Never before had a film made me feel so happy. Four years later, the film still never fails to lift my spirit.The story is so inspiring that one cannot help but stand up and cheer by the end. It sounds typical at first, but as the film progresses, the viewer is shown more and more of just how much determination is in Homer and his friends, to press on toward what they believe in, against so many different naysayers in the society--not the least of which is Homer's father. It's not a movie that purposefully tries to make its audience cry with sappy emotional clich&eacute;s; it's a wonderful true story about a real person's struggle to live his own life.Some people might think of this film as a &quot;feel-good movie&quot; with a familiar and predictable plot, but &quot;October Sky&quot; is so much more than that. It's not melodrama where everyone exaggerates their emotions beyond credibility; all the actors are just so convincing and give stirring performances that make the film all the more powerful. The actors who play Homer's friends bring out lively personalities ranging from nerdy to slow-witted. Laura Dern plays Homer's young teacher Miss Riley, who never stops believing in him and offers to do whatever she can to help him achieve his dream. Chris Cooper plays Homer's tough-talking father, a man whose devotion to the mine eventually beings to bring him away from his family. Even Homer's mother, played by Natalie Canerday, gets a genuinely moving role as she lets out her feelings toward her husband, specifically in just two words: &quot;Myrtle Beach&quot;.But Jake Gyllenhaal gives the best performance as Homer, a boy with such an honest look in his eyes, yet with a determination that never dies despite many hardships. His eyes speak louder than his words in the scene where he tells his father, &quot;Coal mining may be your life, but it's not mine. I'm never going down there again. I want to go into space.&quot;This is a movie that will be engraved in my memory for many years to come. After seeing it, I told all my friends at school about it. I have shown this film to many friends and family members, and none were disappointed.

Homer Hickman(Gyllenhaal) was a humble kid who dreamed of getting out of his coal mine hometown. His father(Cooper)has different views for his son and wants him to get his head out of the stars. Homer takes the ridicule from his father and then puts out one of the greatest acts of persevarance ever told.Jake Gyllenhaal is great. This is superb acting from this young man. He is one of the fastest rising stars in Hollywood and this is his humble beginnig. He plays Homer well. He plays off the other actors around him well. It's an emotional performance in an emotional tale.Chirs Cooper is quickly becoming one of the best actors alive. His performance as Homer's dad is as good as his performance in American Beauty.

69036,A152C8GYY25HAH,0783240694,Matthew Horner,"[2, 2]","I was turned off by the trailers for October Sky and decided to skip it when it was in theaters. I may not have been alone in this decision, as the movie's income stayed earthbound. It was a bad decision. I have an excuse. I am a critic. Everyone knows critics can be exceptionally faulty when it comes to judgment calls. After finally seeing it, I can report that it is one of the best films of 1999.Hollywood has a spotty track record when it comes to movies about small town life, especially when the place is truly in the boondocks -- in this case, the coal country of West Virginia. A bit of history: In the 1930s, studio bosses, most of whom were from places like New York City, created a sort of parallel universe of small towns. The houses and the business were immaculate, as where the citizens. Father knew best. Mom fought with, but eventually sided with, Dad. The kids, who rebelled at times, always wound up sharing the hopes and values of their parents. These movies were quite entertaining [and still are], and the audiences came away both smiling and filled with simplistic moral lessons. Decades later, directors such as Steven Spielburg, were still showing us these same villages. Eventually, these dreamy Hollywood towns became real to people. The problem was it was never the town the moviegoer lived in.It is October 1957. Homer Hickman lives in a tiny hamlet. It's a company town. Its only reason for being is mine coal. Some of the houses are cheerful, but they are built around the bleak company offices. Unlike his brother, who is athletic and may get a football scholarship, Homer's schooling seems destined to end in this, his Senior year. It looks like he will become a miner like his father, but it is obvious from the start that this idea makes the boy miserable.1957 was the year the Soviet Union launched its first satellite, Sputnik. The space race had begun. Some nights, people could stand outside and actually see this wondrous thing flying across the sky.With Homer, it is love at first sight. Just as Sputnik soars, so does his spirit. He has a goal now. He will build a rocket. His two best friends find this a source of great amusement. Homer turns to the school's weird, shy genius -- a nerdy kid who is considered a complete outcast by the student body. Finally, his friends decide to join in on the risky venture. Homer, John, Quentin and Roy Lee find out that successfully launching a small rocket is no easy thing. Encouraged by Miss Riley, one of those rare teachers one never forgets, they persist. She points out to them that they can enter the science fair, and if, by some remote chance, they should win it and go on to the national contest, college scholarships are a possibility.The story itself is interesting enough, but it is the focus on what goes on within Homer's family that makes October Sky so good. Director Joe Johnston has etched an indelible portrait of an American family. The external issues they face are often unlike the ones people face today. The internal issues are timeless. There is the father, John, who has transferred his emotions to his job and who dreams fondly of his sons following in his footsteps. The mother, Elsie, is torn by her unconditional love for Homer and for her stern, taciturn and often distant husband. Homer has to decide between pleasing his father, whom he adores, and following his own dreams. Rarely has a movie so poignantly shown the underlying tension that exists in even the most closely knit family.Jake Gyllenhaal is brilliant as Homer. His is a soulful, thoughtful performance. He has Oscar written all over him -- if not for this part, then for some future role. As the other ""Rocket Boys,"" as the town dubs them, Chad Lindberg, Chris Own and William Lee Scott are excellent. A plus is that each of these boys is shown to have a unique personality. While Natalie Canerday is memorable as Elsie, Chris Cooper is masterful as John. His is the most difficult role.

The story behind OCTOBER SKY, while certainly commendable, however, seems a little flat and inauspicious when compared with people whose achievements seemed a little more prestigious.  Based on the story of a group of boys who try to get out of their West Virginia coal mining town and enter a school science fair, OCTOBER SKY plods along rather self-consciously and seems to be overly concerned with making itself more important than it is.  While the boys' perseverance and dedication is admirable, as a movie, it remains a little too self-congratulatory and ultimately fizzles out.  Jake Gyllenhaal has his moments, but it's Chris Cooper whose role as the obsessed coal mining father who steals the acting honors.

He begins building home made rockets and develops a passion for trying to perfect them. While in his quest for rocket building, he is faced with many challenges, his small coal mining town doesnt support the idea of rocket science so he is made fun of and doesnt have the support of his dad, but instead is more interested in whats below the ground than whats above it.

Director Joe Johnston has done a superb job. The casting is perfect, starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper, and Laura Dern. Gyllenhaal portrays young Homer Hickam Jr, who, after witnessing the success of Russia's Sputnik operation, determines to pursue the art of building rockets, and along with three of his friends, starts wholeheartedly into the hobby. His father (Chris Cooper) a Virginia coal miner, shows disdain toward his son's wholehearted pursuit of rocket science as he tries to persuade him to join the coalmining business, which Homer has no intention of joining at all. His schoolteacher (Laura Dern, who does a much better job at acting than in Jurassic Park) highly inspires Homer and his friends in their rocketeering. In the midst of both encouragement and heavy odds, the four friends overcome discouragement and doubt . . .After seeing this film, I have put the book on which it is based on my reading list, and is a film very well worth purchasing.

We both agree that the overwhelming majority of films being produced today are vulgar, poorly written, and that the special effects in most are greatly overdone.  We generally prefer to stay at home and watch classic movies from the 1940's and 1950's.  So you can imagine our surprise when, while vacationing in a little town in New Hampshire in the fall of 1999, we came across a showing of ""October Sky"" at the local one screen movie house.  Finally, an intelligent movie that we both were excited about seeing! We eagerly purchased our tickets and settled into this little theater for what we hoped would be a very enjoyable evening.""October Sky"" transports the audience back into a time and place that anyone under the age of 35 or so simply cannot relate to.  Coalwood, WV was a ""company"" town where the overwhelming majority of breadwinners worked for the mining company.  It was just assumed by parents and teachers alike that the vast majority of male offspring were destined to follow their dads into the dark, damp, dreary and dangerous coal mine. These working families barely scraped by with the meager wages they earned and most ""owed their soul to the company store"" as Tennessee Ernie Ford pointed out in his 1956 hit recording of ""Sixteen Tons"".  Yes, hope was at a premium among the young people in Coalwood in 1957.  Homer Hickham, Jr. was a senior in high school during that year and he like the rest of the nation became captivated by the novelty and promise of outer space.  When he observed the Soviet satellite Sputnik pass overhead one evening he immediately knew what he wanted to do with his life.  His father was less than enthusiastic about his younger sons ambitions. Fortunately, Homer and three of his buddies were inspired and encouraged by a terrific young teacher named Miss Riley.  ""October Sky"" tells the compelling story of these four teenagers who were bound and determined to build rockets.  With the help and support of many people in this close knit mining community these young men overcame inredible odds and numerous obstacles to achieve their goal of winning the National Science Fair.  This is a good old fashioned heartwarming story!I must tell you that I was absolutely captivated by some of the performances in ""October Sky"".  Jake Gyllenheal was brilliant in his portrayal of young Homer Hickham, Jr. as was Laura Dern in the role of Miss Riley.  And Chris Cooper does a superb job of playing Homer's distant and difficult dad.  This movie was exceptionally well written and the photography was well ""out of this world"". ""October Sky"" is that rare movie that you can view with the entire family.  I can think of a whole host of reasons why parents would be motivated to share this great flick with their children. You will not find any unnecessary violence, sex or vulgarity.  This is just a marvelous film with lots of life's lessons included.  Recently I purchased the Special Edition DVD that was released in 2005.  Included is a fascinating 30 minute commentary by the real Homer Hickam, Jr. During this feature the original ""rocket boys"" are reunited for the first time in decades. It is quite moving.  I just wish that there were more movies being made like this one.

It's right up there on my Favorites' list with ALMOST FAMOUS (as being number 1), and THE SIXTH SENSE. This movie is based on the true-life story of Homer Hickman Jr.It's 1957 in Caolwood, West Virginia. Homer Hickman Jr. (Jake Gyllenhaal), thinks he's not good at anything and the only future he has is working in the coal mines like his father, John Hickman (Chris Cooper), who's one of the headworker's at the coal mines. He knows he can never get a scholarship like his big brother, Jim Hickman (Scott Miles), because only jocks can get scholarships and Jim plays football. So Homer, who can't play any sports, thinks he can never get a scholarship for college. Then, the small town is amazed when they see the Soviet Satellite Sputnik cross the sky one night and Homer is instantly hooked on Outer Space.Homer dreams up of someday creating a rocketship that will go into Outer Space. His father, on the other hand, thinks that is nonsense and the only kind of future he has set for his son is working in the coal mines. So Homer soons comes up with an idea on how to build a rocketship with the help of his three friends, and they somehow end up to overcome the impossible...with the help of Homer's inspiring teacher, Miss. Riley (Laura Dern), and many helpful people from their town.OCTOBER SKY is one truly amazing film with supurb acting by the entire cast and supporting cast. Never in a billion light years would you find a movie so inspiring and heartwarming than OCTOBER SKY. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a truly amazing performance as Homer (and also very cute, as well!).

I basically specialize in good movies. In fact, that's why my standards are so high that I found movies like Mission Impossible 3 and Scary Movie 4 to just plain suck. It's not that the movie was bad, it's just nothing special.Well, this movie is something special. It contains that extremely American characteristic that we can do anything. It shows that who we are is different fromt everything we do and that at any moment we could be spontaneous and still come out kings of what we do. It also shows good faith in everything we do. There is no better movie to watch for these characteristics than this one.The movie is about a boy named Homer who finds himself in a coal mining town with his future set in front of him to be a coal miner. He knows that the mine kills, inside and out, and knows he never wants to go down there, but there just is no escape for him, or so he thinks. His first attempt to escape the town and his future is a failure, trying hard just to make the football team. However, after this fails he moves onto a new idea that maybe he can use his brain to get out of this future ""danger."" That's basically the way the movie works. It wasn't made to be tricky, or something you predict the end of, but rather something you watch just for a good time and even a good heart drop (because medical science shows that becoming sad every now and then is HEALTHY!!!).Now for some careless useless information. This movie is based after the true story called ""Rocket Boys"" which if you rearrange all the letters you get ""October Sky."" Don't ask me how that works, I just marvel at it. Another interesting fact is that it shows stuff about the time period, such as stay home Mom's who can fix the family without lifting a finger.Last, I have a favorite movie list, which is probably the hardest list to get on for any movie.

69075,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,0783240694,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","October Sky (Joe Johnston, 1999)Jake Gyllenhaal's first lead role pretty much set the tone for all that would come after; he has a quiet command of the camera whenever he is in front of it. There aren't a great many actors today as versatile and talented as Gyllenhaal; rare is the film he appears in that isn't worth your time. We knew none of this, of course, in 1999, but watching October Sky, one might well have presaged it.Gyllenhaal stars as Homer Hickam, a high school student in 1950s West Virginia desperate to avoid the almost inevitable mining career the townsfolk fall into upon graduation from high school. Adding extra pressure where Hickam is concerned is that his father, John (Chris Cooper), is the mine foreman. For Hickam, however, everything changes on the nigh Sputnik flies over the town; Hickam decides he, too, is going to build things that fly into space. With the help of three of his classmates and the encouragement of one of his teachers (Laura Dern), Hickam sets off to overcome various obstacles and build himself a rocket.Johnston (Jumanji, Hidalgo, etc.) seems aware that the best way to tell this story is to make himself and the crew as invisible as possible and just let the story unfold on the screen; it is, itself, enough to make a fine film. There are a few pieces that seem as if they're out of place, or that lead nowhere (there's an odd, subdued love-triangle subplot that simply wanders through the film; one assumes it plays a bigger role in the book, but was insufficiently edited out of the screenplay), but they take a back seat to the story of four kids trying to build a working rocket. It's very good stuff, absorbing and inspirational, the kind of movie one rarely finds coming out of big-budget Hollywood these days. Not too much blows up, not a car chase in sight, just a nice, simple story, simply told, that reaches into the heart and tugs a few strings now and then.

These have no place in a movie aimed at young children.  As a warning, there are many scenes depicting very dangerous practices that younger children may attempt to replicate (e.g. a scene that packs gunpowder into a tube that explodes with sufficient force to destroy a fence; I attended a benefit for a kid that lost his hand in similar fashion, my step-brother lost his eye improperly holding a bottle rocket in his hand).  A liquid combustible in a glass bottle is ignited using a soaked rag for a fuse, then thrown into a wooden shack to burn it down.... the liquid is not identified - all reasons for potentially rating this movie PG-13).  The props and the sets are all well done - accurately representing the period.  The directing is superb as is the choice of cast - also the acting.  The story does not stray too far from the real event. I plan to buy a copy of this movie for my collection (having first seen the movie using a library dvd). If everyone stood up and voiced these concerns we would get better family movies from the industry - possibly 'G' rated.  Why does everyone think a 'G' rating is suicide for a movie?  It stands for ""General"" audiences.

We see the problems management and the union are having as well as the parent company wanting to shut down the mine as it becomes less productive. We see Homer's brother Jim a HS football star getting a football scholarship to a college and getting out of being a miner. Homer's dad wants his son Homer to work in the mine as a mining engineer but Homer wants to become a NASA rocket engineer and work with Dr. W von Braun.We see the effect the Russian satellite Sputnik had on the town of Coalwood and Homer. It starts his fascination with rockets and wanting to become a NASA rocket engineer.Homer forms a rocket club and after many attempts with the help of the mines machinists develops a rocket that flies high. We see the club entering the science fair and Homer winning the gold medal for the club and town. Homer shows the medal to his sick Physics teacher Miss Riley in the hospital. She dies of Hodgkin's Lymphoma at age 31. Homer's mom supports him in his rocketry saying ""Just don't blow yourself up"". Finally Homer's Dad arrives and launches the last rocket and finally shows his love for Homer.The movie was great 5 stars but I liked the book Rocket Boys better 5 stars plus. The book was more detailed. The movie missed a lot of character development, Homer's entire teenage sex life and the plot was not as well developed. That said I liked the movie and recommend it 5 stars. Buy the book first and read it.

69114,A16GAIJJE39T1S,0783240694,Ulfilas,"[0, 0]","This is a pretty good movie based on Homer Hickam's autobiographical take on his years as a Sputnik-era high school rocket enthusiast in 1950's rural West Virginia.  Having read Hickam's bookRocket Boys (The Coalwood Series #1)before seeing the movie, however, made me aware of some of the film's awkward approach to developing the film adaptation.  In addition, having spent my early high school years in the 1960's launching Estes-type model rockets with my friends at a farm down the road gave me some insight into the world of Homer Hickam.For my taste, this movie spent too much time on the fictional melodrama of the supposed mine injury of Hickam's father instead of fleshing out its various characters.  The role of Hickam's girlfriend ""Valentine"" was not properly grounded in character development; nor did she correspond in any way to the girl of the same pseudonym in the book.  The most troubling deviation from the events described in the book (at least from my point of view) was that of the boys' search for a lost rocket to prove that it had not caused a fire.  The idea that simple ballistics calculations could somehow guide them to the location of the downed rocket was hard to swallow--as well as the fact that finding the rocket in such a way did not occur in the book.  Hey, if you are going to change an event from that of the book--please go with a substitution that is at least as interesting as one in the book!  From my experience with searching for much lower altitude rockets in just ten or so acres of corn fields, the idea that they could find a much higher altitude rocket downed in extensive forests seems implausible.I still liked this movie and encourage the reader to see it.  It captures the excitement of young people who first encounter the joy of discovery--especially for those interested in science and engineering.  This movie also makes the important point that you don't have to live in a major city or an affluent suburb to get the education and inspiration you need for a challenging and exciting career--the willingness to work independently is often the most important element in achieving success.",4,Country Boy Rocket Enthusiasts Make Good,1317340800,"09 30, 2011",2011,2147,"['pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'based', 'Homer', 'Hickam', 'autobiographical', 'take', 'years', 'Sputnik-era', 'high', 'school', 'rocket', 'enthusiast', '1950', 'rural', 'West', 'Virginia', 'Having', 'read', 'Hickam', 'bookRocket', 'Boys', 'Coalwood', 'Series', '1', 'seeing', 'movie', 'however', 'made', 'aware', 'film', 'awkward', 'approach', 'developing', 'film', 'adaptation', 'addition', 'having', 'spent', 'early', 'high', 'school', 'years', '1960', 'launching', 'Estes-type', 'model', 'rockets', 'friends', 'farm', 'down', 'road', 'gave', 'insight', 'world', 'Homer', 'Hickam.For', 'taste', 'movie', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'fictional', 'melodrama', 'supposed', 'mine', 'injury', 'Hickam', 'father', 'instead', 'fleshing', 'out', 'various', 'characters', 'role', 'Hickam', 'girlfriend', 'Valentine', 'was', 'not', 'properly', 'grounded', 'character', 'development', 'did', 'correspond', 'way', 'girl', 'same', 'pseudonym', 'book', 'most', 'troubling', 'deviation', 'events', 'described', 'book', 'least', 'point', 'view', 'was', 'boys', 'search', 'lost', 'rocket', 'prove', 'had', 'not', 'caused', 'fire', 'idea', 'simple', 'ballistics', 'calculations', 'could', 'somehow', 'guide', 'location', 'downed', 'rocket', 'was', 'hard', 'swallow', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'finding', 'rocket', 'such', 'way', 'did', 'not', 'occur', 'book', 'Hey', 'are', 'going', 'change', 'event', 'book', 'please', 'go', 'substitution', 'least', 'as', 'interesting', 'one', 'book', 'experience', 'searching', 'much', 'lower', 'altitude', 'rockets', 'just', 'ten', 'so', 'acres', 'corn', 'fields', 'idea', 'could', 'find', 'much', 'higher', 'altitude', 'rocket', 'downed', 'extensive', 'forests', 'implausible.I', 'still', 'liked', 'movie', 'encourage', 'reader', 'see', 'excitement', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'first', 'encounter', 'joy', 'discovery', 'especially', 'interested', 'science', 'engineering', 'movie', 'also', 'important', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'live', 'major', 'city', 'affluent', 'suburb', 'get', 'education', 'inspiration', 'need', 'challenging', 'exciting', 'career', 'willingness', 'work', 'independently', 'often', 'most', 'important', 'element', 'achieving', 'success']",N/A
69115,AV37WGFZH7PIO,0783240694,"Vincent Tesi ""Vinny""","[3, 3]","October Sky has it all, superb acting especially from Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper, crisp editing and an inspiring storyline, an uplifting soundtrack, and realistic camera work that captures the grittiness of the West Virgina coal life with the innocence of 1950's youth. The film centers on a strained relationship between a tough coal miner (Chris Cooper) and his son Homer ( Jake Gyllenhaal).  Homer wishes to escape the harsh realities of a small West Virgina town dependent on the operation of its mine and coal production.  Spurred by the Soviet launching of Sputnik, Homer begins building rockets in hopes that symbolically they will transport him to a world outside the coalmines.  His father, played brilliantly by Cooper resents his son's scientific aspirations as pipe dreams that will never succeed.  The conflict between father and son is dramatically and painfully acted throughout the film.  Exceptional dialogue and emotion are poured into every scene shared by Cooper and Gyllenhaal.  The rest of the ""rocket boys"" give credible supporting performances.  Chris Owen as Homer's mom almost steals the picture.  Her artwork also reflects a longing for escape, and her loyalty to her husband and son is tested throughout the picture.  The only weak link in the cast is Laura Dern who gives a wooden, cliched performance as a high school science teacher. Based on a true story, this film should be enjoyed by the entire family. Hollywood needs to keep finding human interest stories such as this one, to interrupt the flow of nonsense action films that have flooded movie theaters and video stores across the country.

69116,AQP1VPK16SVWM,0783240694,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[20, 21]","With the Cold War brewing and the launch of Sputnik, paranoia captured America in its tight little grip. There were exceptions. A quartet of boys in a West Virginia coal mining town discovered their love of rocketry. Sputnik inspired them to develop their own rockets and launch them out in the wilderness. With the help and inspiration of a sympathetic teacher (Laura Dern), Homer (Jake Gyllenhaal) fights his tough father (Chris Cooper) who wants Homer to get his education and then become a coalminer just like him.  Ultimately Homer achieves his dream but not before conflict, an arrest, lack of support and lack of funds try combine to try and undermine those dreams.An intelligent and involving period drama,  October Sky overcomes the pitfalls of dramas of this sort; Director Joe Johnston creates an involving, suspenseful story about a town with myopic vision and fears and a boy who dreams far beyond the reaches of the town to the stars. Gyllenhaal (The Day After Tomorrow) gives a stirring and confident performance as Homer. The entire cast particularly Chris Cooper and Laura Dern in major supporting roles add a sense of gritty reality to the film preventing it from degenerating into a ""based on a true story"" TV movie. Colick's screenplay doesn't take the easy way out here; he portrays Homer's father as an unsympathetic hard man who loves his sons but doesn't want them giving into pipedreams so he doesn't support them.October Sky looks as clear as a perfect, cloudless moonlit night with rich blacks and nice color reproduction of the original theatrical film. There's some minor artifacting (this appears to be the same digital master used for the 1999 DVD release although it appears for the first time in the higher definition format of anamorphic widescreen) issues but, on the whole, the film looks particularly sharp and vivid. The 5.1 mix and DTS soundtracks both sound crisp and sharp with the edge going to the DTS soundtrack which tends to be fuller and with a wider dynamic range than the 5.1 mix. Both soundtracks use the surround speakers well particularly during the sequences when the boys are setting off their rockets.Although this is the same digital master as last time, we go get some new special features that might make this worthwhile to fans of the film. There's a new documentary Aiming High: The Story of the Rocket Boys featuring interviews with Homer Hickam and his compatriots from West Virginia who inspired this story and Hickam to write his book. The documentary primarily focuses on Hickam and his leap from rocketry whiz to a position working for NASA. The original extras are also included. There's a  Spotlight on Location featurette which, essentially, is a glorified promo for the film that showed on some of the cable channels. There's also production notes discussing the various people involved in the production from the actors to production crew. The theatrical trailer, which highlights the art of trailers in the way it summarizes the story but also why this film was a difficult sell for audiences, returns on this edition as well.Homer Hickam does a great job separating fact from fiction in his commentary track. Surprisingly, the film remains accurate for the most part to Hickam's book and the few times it does divulge from reality it's usually for dramatic reasons and Hickam acknowledges that it does make dramatic sense. Although much of the action seems telescoped most of the action that occurs in the film (with a few exceptions) accurately portrays what occurred during the time frame of the film. Hickam notes those few exceptions and also gives the reasons the filmmakers decided to alter his story.A marvelous story, October Sky features a number of strong performances. The new extras including Hickam's commentary track make this a worthwhile addition for fans of the movie. The better picture quality along with the new extra features will make this a worthwhile addition for fans of the film.",4,Exceptional drama about four boys and their dream,1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,3978,"['Cold', 'War', 'brewing', 'launch', 'Sputnik', 'paranoia', 'captured', 'America', 'tight', 'little', 'grip', 'were', 'exceptions', 'quartet', 'boys', 'West', 'Virginia', 'coal', 'mining', 'town', 'discovered', 'love', 'rocketry', 'Sputnik', 'inspired', 'develop', 'own', 'rockets', 'launch', 'out', 'wilderness', 'help', 'inspiration', 'sympathetic', 'teacher', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'Homer', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'tough', 'father', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'who', 'Homer', 'get', 'education', 'then', 'become', 'coalminer', 'just', 'Ultimately', 'Homer', 'achieves', 'dream', 'not', 'conflict', 'arrest', 'lack', 'support', 'lack', 'funds', 'try', 'combine', 'try', 'undermine', 'dreams.An', 'intelligent', 'involving', 'period', 'drama', 'October', 'Sky', 'pitfalls', 'dramas', 'sort', 'Director', 'Joe', 'Johnston', 'involving', 'suspenseful', 'story', 'town', 'myopic', 'vision', 'fears', 'boy', 'who', 'far', 'reaches', 'town', 'stars', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Day', 'Tomorrow', 'stirring', 'confident', 'performance', 'Homer', 'entire', 'cast', 'particularly', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'major', 'supporting', 'roles', 'add', 'sense', 'gritty', 'reality', 'film', 'preventing', 'degenerating', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'TV', 'movie', 'Colick', 'screenplay', ""n't"", 'take', 'easy', 'way', 'here', 'Homer', 'father', 'unsympathetic', 'hard', 'man', 'who', 'sons', ""n't"", 'want', 'giving', 'pipedreams', 'so', ""n't"", 'support', 'them.October', 'Sky', 'as', 'clear', 'perfect', 'cloudless', 'moonlit', 'night', 'rich', 'blacks', 'nice', 'color', 'reproduction', 'original', 'theatrical', 'film', 'minor', 'artifacting', 'be', 'same', 'digital', 'master', 'used', '1999', 'DVD', 'release', 'first', 'time', 'higher', 'definition', 'format', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'issues', 'whole', 'film', 'particularly', 'sharp', 'vivid', '5.1', 'mix', 'DTS', 'soundtracks', 'sound', 'crisp', 'sharp', 'edge', 'going', 'DTS', 'soundtrack', 'be', 'fuller', 'wider', 'dynamic', 'range', '5.1', 'mix', 'soundtracks', 'use', 'surround', 'speakers', 'well', 'particularly', 'sequences', 'when', 'boys', 'are', 'setting', 'off', 'rockets.Although', 'same', 'digital', 'master', 'last', 'time', 'go', 'get', 'new', 'special', 'features', 'might', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'fans', 'film', 'new', 'documentary', 'Aiming', 'High', 'Story', 'Rocket', 'Boys', 'featuring', 'interviews', 'Homer', 'Hickam', 'compatriots', 'West', 'Virginia', 'who', 'inspired', 'story', 'Hickam', 'write', 'book', 'documentary', 'primarily', 'Hickam', 'leap', 'rocketry', 'whiz', 'position', 'working', 'NASA', 'original', 'extras', 'are', 'also', 'included', 'Spotlight', 'Location', 'featurette', 'essentially', 'glorified', 'promo', 'film', 'showed', 'cable', 'channels', 'also', 'production', 'notes', 'discussing', 'various', 'people', 'involved', 'production', 'actors', 'production', 'crew', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'art', 'trailers', 'way', 'story', 'also', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'difficult', 'sell', 'audiences', 'returns', 'edition', 'well.Homer', 'Hickam', 'great', 'job', 'separating', 'fact', 'fiction', 'commentary', 'track', 'Surprisingly', 'film', 'accurate', 'most', 'part', 'Hickam', 'book', 'few', 'times', 'divulge', 'reality', 'usually', 'dramatic', 'reasons', 'Hickam', 'make', 'dramatic', 'sense', 'much', 'action', 'telescoped', 'most', 'action', 'film', 'few', 'exceptions', 'accurately', 'what', 'occurred', 'time', 'frame', 'film', 'Hickam', 'notes', 'few', 'exceptions', 'also', 'reasons', 'filmmakers', 'decided', 'alter', 'story.A', 'marvelous', 'story', 'October', 'Sky', 'number', 'strong', 'performances', 'new', 'extras', 'including', 'Hickam', 'commentary', 'track', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'addition', 'fans', 'movie', 'better', 'picture', 'quality', 'new', 'extra', 'features', 'will', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'addition', 'fans', 'film']",N/A

From there on, the great pacing of the story development carries me on till the last climactic moment. The snatches of rock and roll in the sound track are the same tunes I listened to.
