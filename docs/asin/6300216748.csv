222512,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6300216748,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Three Days of the Condor, 1975 filmThe story begins in an office building. A man rides a motor scooter in city traffic. A man in an automobile watches people enter this office. [It looks like an old mansion converted to offices.] Workers talks about a novel. What productive work do they do? One worker goes out to lunch by an unauthorized exit. A postman approaches the door. People are shot down with a silenced sub-machine gun! When the man returns from lunch he finds the bodies. Turner takes a pistol for defense as he leaves the building. [This tells about that era.] He telephones in the news and receives instructions. A cleaning crew arrives to tidy up the mess and confirm the report. Condor stays on the street until he visits another victim. Turner is warned about two visitors to his flat!A known friend is used for identification when they meet. But something goes wrong! Condor flies away and enters a store. He says hello to Kathy and takes over her car, she drives to Brooklyn Heights (a trendy location). Upper level management discuss this problem (Condor was blamed by Wicks). He explains his work: reading adventure stories and putting them into a computer so they can be checked against real operations. [Sort of like this review?] The assassin reports to his employer. Wicks will be done next. [Can you believe everything you see on TV?] Turner goes to visit a friend's wife. He takes the elevator down, and gets people to accompany him to his car. Is the license plate read? Turner returns to Kathy in Brooklyn Heights, they talk about things. The next morning Turner read a memo copied to Wicks. Two nurses monitor a patient in the hospital; the warning buzzer goes on. A mailman shows up with a package that has to be signed for. [Note the trick to gain entrance.] Are his shoes unusual? Turner survives, then telephones Washington. We see the Twin Towers in lower Manhattan.Kathy goes to an office building. She is unescorted (believable?). Kathy delivers a message to Addison, who gets to meet Turner for a talk. Wicks died in the hospital. Turner knows how to trace a key to a hotel. Next a phone message is traced. Turner learns a fact and acts on it. He visits the Deputy Director of Operations. Is there a connection between those locations? That Alsatian shows up to perform his job. Attwood won't embarrass his employers. Turner is warned what could happen back in New York city. He meets Addison, who speaks to him about plans and games. What happens if there are future shortages? Turner wrote a report and gave it to a newspaper. [Like the ""Pentagon Papers""?] Will they print it? Who knows? [Their Board of Directors cooperate with Government agencies at times.]Some scenes were filmed in downtown Manhattan next to the World Trade Center Twin Towers. The idea of a novel that could echo a real intelligence operation is interesting. I'm sure some novels could, a work of fiction is better if is based on reality. ""Double Indemnity"" was said to be based on the Snyder-Gray murder (a husband bumped off to free the wife). But wasn't there a story in the Bible about King David? I liked this movie better when I first say it in 1975. Parts of it seem implausible today. How much danger can come from a low-selling novel?

It looks like a very precise rendering of the original 1970's presentation.  Hasn't been tinkered with much, just a great upgrade from DVD without compromising the integrity of the image.  The sound is also accurate for this film.  And the digital track included does the job effectively without being ""sweetened.""  The Extras are really teriffic: a couple of documentaries (both of which are in English; this was apparently a UK release,) and the commentary by the now deceased director Sydney Pollack is very informative; even if he only comments sporadically.

This slow-paced cinematic effort from Sydney Pollack is mostly gripping, but marred by two plot holes.  The first is the seeming inability of the CIA to compare the two bullets in the alley shooting -- and discover that they were fired by two different pistols.  Oops; I guess that would have taken the focus of guilt off of Redford's character too early in the story.  The second hole is the inexplicable reason why Faye Dunaway's character would so quickly submit to the charm of Redford's character, after being kidnapped.  A classic example of internalized oppression in women -- in a world where men get what they want, and women too realize the power structure through their own self-imposed subjugation.

222521,ALR35EFI69S5R,6300216748,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[114, 118]","I first saw this suspense/spy thriller when it was first released in the theaters sometime in the late 1970s, while living in London and working for the American government. There's nothing that compares with the paranoia associated with seeing a taut spy thriller, only to exit the theater into a cold, foggy late evening in downtown London.  The picture it paints of a murderous renegade network operating within the Central Intelligence Agency is both frightening and plausible, and is delivered by Robert Redford and his production team in a tight, well-developed tale with a convincing thread of interconnecting events that spins way out of control as the protagonist tries desperately to figure out who is at the center of the plot and why he and his cohorts at a special studies institute sponsored by the Agency are targets. For me, this movie is a nonstop roller-coaster ride, with Redford trying in vain to jump off the damn thing before it crashes below!The level of paranoia as well as the multiple levels of deceit and deception depicted in the film seemed a bit outlandish at the time, but given the temper of the times, it somehow seemed much more plausible in the backwash of Watergate and all that was revealed about the machinations of the so-called ""invisible government"" then. The hero's ability to parse together the facts and learn and adapt as he progresses makes the movie work especially well, and one can relate to his growing frustration as he realizes there just may not be any way out alive. And between the margins of the scenes lie some intriguing questions regarding the role of secrecy in an open and supposedly democratic society that add a measure of intellectual acumen and ""gravitas"" to the tale.So popular was this movie at the box office that it spawned a number of other spy thrillers in its wake. The film's cast included not only Redford as the hero, but also starred Fay Dunaway, and Cliff Robertson. This movie makes for an absorbing evening of entertainment, and a surefire way to escape the humdrum of everyday life with a stunning tale of murder, mayhem, and betrayal.

To survive he must use his wits and what he has learned from his reading.The movie ""Three days of the Condor"" is based on this book, which is really first in a series of books, sort of like the James Bond series. Naturally being film media the story needed cutting down to size, hence three days instead of six.Robert Redford has to squeeze James Grady's ""Six Days of the Condor"" into the Redford mold. The book plot of drugs and Viet Nam are out. Redford's substitute plot of oil and Arabs is in. Bad guys differ.Great acting, great actors and a few faux pas, such as if they knew there was a back door to the location, don't you think it would be watched?Tina Chen (Janice) can be seen again in the movie ""Paper Man"" (1971) where her computer prints out ""DEATH DEATH DEATH""Now in Blu-ray for those obsesses with technology.

I agree with the reviewer that, after countless viewings, I can't put my finger on why it is so mesmerizing.  There is Redford's performance, probably his most nuanced and all round best on film.  There is Pollack's direction, which keeps the film moving so well that you don't have time to think about some of the questionable parts of the script, which nonetheless, serves the film well.  The plot, while a bit convoluted, is superior in my opinion to that of the book on which the film is based.  Max van Sydow is superb as usual, as a hitman who actually finds his job relaxing, and whose hobby is painting little ceramic figurines.  He does not worry about the right or wrong of the cause ... only who is paying him.  John Houseman in a small part plays a menacing career bureaucrat in the CIA.  And Cliff Robertson is excellent as Condor's contact.  You wonder if he is Condor's friend or not.  Well, watch the film.This is not one of those films that, because it is a suspense film, you might not view again after you know the ending.  &quot;Condor&quot; is delightful upon repeated viewings, even if you know the ending and can recite many bits of dialog by heart.  Again, I can't exactly say why, but has to do with the contributions of the people I enumerated in the previous paragraph.

To be fair, though, the music in film should match the music of the time period, which it does, but it's just that they didn't choose the best music from the period.  (It's funny because, in my opinion, some of the best popular music ever produced was from the 70s.  A lot of the singer-songwriter stuff was really good, much better than the so-called &#34;music&#34; that's come out since 1990.  Don't get me started. . . .)Something else that I noticed while watching on March 5, 2013:  many of the actors in this film have died:  Cliff Robertson and John Houseman to name just a couple.  But luckily for us, actors such as Robert Redford, Faye Dunaway and even Max von Sydow are still around, and still producing some pretty good work.  And I've always been a really big fan of Mr. Redford's, so I always watch his films whenever I get the chance.I have to admit, this film came across as a little too conspiracy theory to me.  Naturally, in a political thriller, you need the &#34;good guys&#34; and you need the &#34;bad guys,&#34; and so the screenplay decided to use some of the people who were supposed to be &#34;good guys&#34; and made them the &#34;bad guys.&#34;  You always need conflict to make any film work, and so they had to go the conspiracy-theory route to achieve that conflict.  It could also be argued that they threw in the Redford-Dunaway matchup just because American audiences always seem to demand a love interest -- something that can really get in the way of good filmmaking, and it surely tries to do that here -- so that argument might be valid.  However, I do have to admit that there was some real chemistry between Ms. Dunaway and Mr. Redford.Still, a pretty good movie, minus perhaps for some of the music.  For me, more like a 3.5.

Voila, 30 years later, the U.S. has invaded the Mideast. When the Redford character finally confronts the rogue C.I.A. leader of the plan, he connects the dots and says, ""This whole damn thing is about oil, isn't it?"" Exactly.Let's be clear about why the U.S. Armed Forces are in Iraq, rather than, say, Ecuador or Nepal: it's the strategic importance of the region's oil. Yes, the plan is to transform Iraq into a democratic nation, which will lead the entire region in that direction. But the U.S. isn't committing its treasure and citizenry to all troubled regions of the globe equally; we are in Iraq because it is the strategic linchpin of the region. Without access to the Mideast oil reserves, the world economy would be shaken to its foundations.There are many troubled, undemocratic regions in the world--for example, much of Africa; yet we fight now to establish democracy in only one troubled region, the Mideast. Coincidence? No. Simple self-interest. As the Cliff Robertson character says at the film's conclusion: ""When the people are cold and their engines stop running, they're not going to ask us why; they'll just want us to go get it.""Realizing that he is an embarrassment to the C.I.A. (the inevitable role of any whistleblower, even a reluctant one), at the film's end Redford gives the entire story to the New York Times.

222544,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6300216748,C. O. DeRiemer,"[0, 0]","The first 15 minutes of this movie is one of the great film set-ups about murderous, paranoid governmental machinations. Joe Turner (Robert Redford) is a bookish researcher for a CIA front called The American Literary Historical Society It's a rainy New York day. We see Joe, a good guy, maybe a little naive, chat about his job of reading all sorts of material and having it fed into CIA computers to look for code opportunities. We meet the elderly, acerbic but good-natured woman at the front desk and the middle-aged guard in the hall. We see the obvious affection between Joe and the young woman who works on the second floor with the computers. Since it's raining, Joe volunteers to get lunch. He takes their orders, runs out the back way in the rain and through a couple of alleys to a lunch diner. When he comes back 20 minutes later, everyone has been gunned down. We see it happen. We see a tall, middle-aged man with an umbrella pause in the rain by a car. We see a postman carrying a large mail bag walking down the street. We see a fellow wearing a rain-slicked poncho turn a corner. We see Joe's associates methodically and quickly killed. ""Would you move from the window, please?"" asks the tall man when he enters the computer room. The young woman is puzzled for a moment but then sees the gun the second man is pointing at her. ""I won't scream,"" she says. ""I know,"" he tells her, with just a little sadness. He turns away while she's shot.Joe Turner, distraught and afraid, calls CIA headquarters to report what happened and to ask for help. Now code-named Condor, he quickly finds himself being hunted. He realizes that it may be the CIA itself that wants him dead, or it might be some sort of rogue operation within the CIA. Either way, it appears more people want him out of the way than alive and safe. He kidnaps a young woman (Faye Dunaway) who eventually agrees to help him. He finds out who the assassin is, a man called Joubert (Max von Sydow). He learns not to trust the CIA manager, Higgins (Cliff Robertson), who supposedly is trying to help him. Joe Turner realizes that even the so-called good guys aren't to be believed. ""Boy, what is it with you people?"" he says to Higgins. ""You think not getting caught in a lie is the same thing as telling the truth?""Before long, Joe Turner has had to change from a bookish academic to a resourceful action figure. Eventually Joe Turner figures out most of what has happened. When he encounters Joubert face-to-face in the elegant home of a senior CIA executive, he figures out the rest. Joe Turner was right to be paranoid. The conclusion is hopeful but not assured.I think the movie works so well for two reasons. The first is the sheer Hollywood professionalism of the film. Director Sydney Pollack knows his way about a movie; he knows how to keep things moving, how to build character; how to develop tension and atmosphere...in other words, how to hook us and keep us hooked. Robert Redford is one of the quintessential Hollywood star actors. He's good at acting, and he carries real star power. Through some magic of personality and charisma, his transition from smart, easy-going researcher to resourceful action lead is believable, in part because even as an action lead Redford's Joe Turner doesn't pretend to be anything other than still puzzled. Faye Dunaway is another star performer who, in this role, punches above her character's weight. The only times the movie slows down is during the scenes between Redford and Dunaway. Her part is really little more than a contrivance. It's a credit to both that we can get past this without too much impatience.The second reason the movie works so well is, I think, because of Max von Sydow. He plays Joubert, the assassin for hire, with a surprising amount of near nobility. Joubert is a completely practical killer, but one who thinks and, occasionally, permits himself a bit of introspection and empathy for some of his victims. ""Well, the fact is,"" he says at one point to Joe, ""what I do is not a bad occupation. Someone is always willing to pay."" ""I would find it... tiring,"" Turner says. ""Oh, no...it's quite restful,"" Joubert tells him. ""It's almost peaceful. No need to believe in either side, or any side. There is no cause. There's only yourself. The belief is in your own precision."" Von Sydow is so subtle and accomplished an actor that he can convey a range of emotion with just a slight inflection of voice or the slightest change in expression. In a way, von Sydow's Joubert has come to respect Joe Turner, and even gives him some sincere advice. At the end of the movie he offers a ride to Turner. ""I'd like to go back to New York,"" Turner says. ""You have not much future there,"" Joubert tells him. He pauses for a moment, thinking about what he is about to say. ""It will happen this way. You may be walking. Maybe the first sunny day of the spring. And a car will slow beside you, and a door will open, and someone you know, maybe even trust, will get out of the car. And he will smile, a becoming smile. But he will leave open the door of the car and offer to give you a lift."" Pollack and Redford give Three Days of the Condor a great deal of energy and interest. I think von Sydow gives it a surprising amount of depth and quality.",4,"Pollack And Redford Deal With Paranoia And Murder, With Great Support From Max von Sydow",1164240000,"11 23,

222545,A2DB22MRLKXUT4,6300216748,"Collin O'Donnell ""HAL 9000""","[0, 0]","The mid-60's going into the 70's were a turbulent time for political thrillers. Americans were quickly losing faith in their government. JFK was assassinated, his assassin was assassinated, Bobby Kennedy was assassinated, Vietnam was a train-wreck, and Watergate seemed to be the straw that broke the camels back. Alan J. Pakula was at the forefront of the political thriller genre with his trilogy Klute, The Parallax View, and All The President's Men. Francis Ford Coppola's 1974 film The Conversation is another notable entry in the genre. In 1975, Sydney Pollack, hot of the trail of his two diverse hits, Jeremiah Johnson and The Way We Were, joined the ranks of Pakula and Coppola with his paranoid thriller, Three Days of the Condor. Based on a novel by James Grady, the film follows Condor, a CIA 'reader' who is on a quest for truth after he discovers that his office building was raided and all of his coworkers were killed. In typical fashion of the genre, 3DOTC chooses a suspicious atmosphere in lieu of straight-forward storytelling. To complement the paranoid aura of the screenplay, cinematographer Owen Roizman creates a wonderfully dark world to accompany the characters. Roizman, who also worked on The Exorcist and Network, is no stranger to grim material. Through low lighting and sharp camerawork, he achieves the ambience needed to convey the unease to the audience. Robert Redford, a frequent collaborator of Pollack's, works wonders as the Condor. Redford never collapses under the paranoia, and his strong screen presence adds much needed realism to his character's determination. Faye Dunaway plays Kathy with a surprising amount of subtlety. Unfortunately, the romance between her and Condor comes off as completely unnecessary steam in an otherwise taut film. Max von Sydow is truly brilliant as the complex CIA-hired assassin, Joubert. His uncharacteristic cordiality makes him an endlessly compelling character and von Sydow is physically perfect for the role of a considerate assassin. The music is one of the film's only missteps. Why use funk/jazz fusion in a movie that is trying to induce paranoia in the viewer? Other than that, Pollack's effort fits snugly in the string of exceptional post-Watergate thrillers.",5,Fantastic Post-Watergate Thriller,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,2249,"['mid-60', 'going', '70', 'were', 'turbulent', 'time', 'political', 'thrillers', 'Americans', 'were', 'quickly', 'losing', 'faith', 'government', 'JFK', 'was', 'assassinated', 'assassin', 'was', 'assassinated', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'assassinated', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'train-wreck', 'Watergate', 'seemed', 'be', 'straw', 'broke', 'camels', 'back', 'Alan', 'J.', 'Pakula', 'was', 'forefront', 'political', 'thriller', 'genre', 'trilogy', 'Klute', 'Parallax', 'View', 'President', 'Men', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', '1974', 'film', 'Conversation', 'notable', 'entry', 'genre', '1975', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'hot', 'trail', 'two', 'diverse', 'hits', 'Jeremiah', 'Johnson', 'Way', 'Were', 'joined', 'ranks', 'Pakula', 'Coppola', 'paranoid', 'thriller', 'Three', 'Days', 'Condor', 'Based', 'novel', 'James', 'Grady', 'film', 'Condor', 'CIA', ""'reader"", 'who', 'quest', 'truth', 'office', 'building', 'was', 'raided', 'coworkers', 'were', 'killed', 'typical', 'fashion', 'genre', '3DOTC', 'suspicious', 'atmosphere', 'lieu', 'straight-forward', 'storytelling', 'complement', 'paranoid', 'aura', 'screenplay', 'cinematographer', 'Owen', 'Roizman', 'wonderfully', 'dark', 'world', 'accompany', 'characters', 'Roizman', 'who', 'also', 'worked', 'Exorcist', 'Network', 'stranger', 'grim', 'material', 'low', 'lighting', 'sharp', 'camerawork', 'ambience', 'needed', 'convey', 'unease', 'audience', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'frequent', 'collaborator', 'Pollack', 'wonders', 'Condor', 'Redford', 'never', 'paranoia', 'strong', 'screen', 'presence', 'much', 'needed', 'realism', 'character', 'determination', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Kathy', 'surprising', 'amount', 'subtlety', 'Unfortunately', 'romance', 'Condor', 'off', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'steam', 'otherwise', 'taut', 'film', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'complex', 'CIA-hired', 'assassin', 'Joubert', 'uncharacteristic', 'cordiality', 'endlessly', 'compelling', 'character', 'von', 'Sydow', 'physically', 'perfect', 'role', 'considerate', 'assassin', 'music', 'one', 'film', 'only', 'missteps', 'Why', 'use', 'funk/jazz', 'fusion', 'movie', 'trying', 'induce', 'paranoia', 'viewer', 'Other', 'Pollack', 'effort', 'snugly', 'string', 'exceptional', 'post-Watergate', 'thrillers']",Three Days of the Condor VHS

He however has no assurances that his life will be free of danger even after he reveals the mechanisms of the illicit operation to the press.Sydney Pollack does an excellent job in representing the secretive tenor of government operations during a sensitive era in U.S. history replete with orchestrated coverups like Watergate.

I have seen it multiple times and will continue to watch it.Having said that, I have to admit I laugh when I read critics (elsewhere) writing about how ""intelligent"" this movie is. Intelligent? Yeah, right.Let's see. A man goes out to lunch and comes back to discover (after walking into an open front door that previously shuts and locks automatically) that all his co-workers have been murdered. Shortly afterward, he is shot at by a professional killer, who, conveniently, misses! OK. Now on the run, our hero (Robert Redford) kidnaps a woman at random in broad daylight and forces her at gunpoint back to her apartment. (Nobody sees any of this.) About two hours later, the woman is making love to the man and is instantly in love with him!!It gets better. The man - a professional reader, a bookworm, instantly turns into James Bond and the woman is instantly transformed from a lonely, shrinking violet into an international spy, boldly breaking into the CIA and talking tough to an agent. Wow, yes, that sure sounds plausible to me!Well, I''ll repeat one thing, for the readers here who forgot my opening paragraph and think I am panning the film. I am not.

If you like cloak and dagger, spy stories that pick you up out of your seat, and carry you along on a whirlwind of intrigue, treachery, and overstepping government bureaucrats this is the seminary film that similar films are measured.  You can't say it any better than this: superb acting by Redford, Dunaway, Max von Sydow, Cliff Robertson and John Houseman.  In particular, von Sydow as the intellectual, charming, sophisticated but heartless killer keeps you spellbound and never sure of his next move.  One minute he's out to kill you and the next, offers you a ride into the city.  First rate stuff.  Both Redford and Dunaway are at the top of their game and their portrayal of a studious spy and average woman are right on the mark.  The unexpected opening action scene, that leaves Redford's character in a bind, and out in the cold, sets the stage for the rest of the film--who can he trust and when can he trust them.  Back then, the idea of the U.S. Government carrying out assassinations against U.S. citizens seemed hard to believe but now, TDOTC rings too true. We trust the Government a lot less now than we did then.  All in all, if you haven't seen this film--you have missed out on a truly marvelous gem of a film and I would recommend it to everyone.

Markel,"[5, 5]","This review is for the 1999 widescreen release by Paramount.The story involves a man named Joe Turner (Robert Redford) who works in a New York brownstone building that poses as a private literature society when in fact its an undercover operation for the CIA.  His job is decoding possible enemy secrets found in publications printed anywhere in the world.  Turner runs an errand by leaving through the back of the building, and minutes later the office is raided by assassins and the 8 or so remaining employees are all killed.  Turner returns to his office and finds his fellow employees dead and contacts his superiors at the CIA Headquarters.  He begins to realize that things are not adding up and goes into hiding.  As the film moves on, he essentially kidnaps a woman (played by Faye Dunaway) and with her help, they devote their time together figuring out what has really happened.The movie is filled with twists and turns.  Since Turner is an avid reader and has vast knowledge of intellegence operations, he does a magnificent job protecting himself as well as uncovering information about his advocaries.  There is one unforgettable scene where Turner meets a professional assassin (Max Von Sydow) and the contract killer describes his work and with a straight face he mentions that he finds his job rather peaceful.  This is definitely one of the best thrillers from the '70s.The DVD picture quality is nearly perfect with occasional tiny spots of film wear, but it is nothing to be overly bothered with.

It was one of the only periods in the history of cinema during which Hollywood was the champion of morality. Alas, times change...THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR stands very well the test of time with a solid plot involving a Faye Dunaway smiling for the first and last time in a motion picture, a Robert Redford gaining with this role a star status and a Max Von Sydow impersonating an official hitman. Nevertheless, there are a few gaps in the screenplay ; for instance, Robert Redford can a little bit too easily enter the Bell Central building and Faye Dunaway hasn't any difficulty to meet one of the C.I.A. big bosses.

Truth be told, this is a front channel, dialogue driven film.  If there was use of any bass, it's that old 70's bass picking style that was popular at the time that utilizes the bass.  As for the action sequences, the gunshots and everything else seems quite bland but I was not expecting thrilling audio directionals to come from all speaker channels with this film, so I found the audio satisfactory for a film this old.Subtitles are featured in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""3 DAYS OF THE CONDOR"" has only one special feature and that is the original theatrical trailer with scratches and dust galore.  The trailer is in HD but it would have been nice to have someone do a commentary or revisit this film especially how relevant it is in today's modern world.JUDGMENT CALL:""3 DAYS OF THE CONDOR"" is a very good conspiracy thriller.  What is quite shocking about this film which was released in 1975 is how it actually predicts the government's involvement in future affairs.  I don't want to go into too much into the film without spoiling it but I will say that what Turner is able to find out, it's what's happening in today's modern world, especially with the United States.What is also a bit numbing to see is the few shots of the Twin Towers and the film featuring the two buildings not long after they were built.Robert Redford's performance was fine but there were some lines that almost echoed a John Wayne style of acting which was acceptable around that time but for today's modern viewers, it may not hold up.Stars that did shine in this film were Faye Dunaway, who did a great job playing the role of Kathy Hale.  As a captive hostage turned woman who is willing to aid her abductor, this was a film that seems to utilize ""Stockholm Syndrome"" and not surprising considering that the Patty Hearst-SLA bank robberies in real life happened in 1974 or perhaps its a woman who agrees to help Joe Turner because both share a side of sadness and loneliness in their life.Max von Sydow as the assassin Joubert is also quite effective in his role, especially during the big reveal near the end of the film.In reviewing this Blu-ray release, although a few artifacts and dust are seen on the video quality, this is probably the best transfer we will get of the film.  The audio quality is uninspiring but considering this is not a modern film which we come to expect full utilization of audio channels, ""3 DAYS OF THE CONDOR"" is quite clear in dialogue and for a 1975 film, taking all things into consideration, this is a pretty good transfer on Blu-ray ala HD.My main peeve with this Blu-ray release is that a film with so much relevance for today's modern world, it would have been wonderful to have interviews with the stars or having some sort of special feature included other than the trailer.The film is a well-written, well-edited and captivating thriller with a storyline that I don't know if Sydney Pollack or even novel writer James Grady knew how relevant it would be over 30 years later.Overall, ""3 DAYS OF THE CONDOR"" is definitely an action-thriller classic definitely worth recommending!",5,Blu-ray: A wonderful thriller that gets its HD transfer but I wished there was commentary and more special features,1242691200,"05 19,

Three Days of the Condor is an amazing piece of work which finds all of its participants -- Robert Redford, Faye Dunaway, Max von Sydow, director Sydney Pollack -- in top form, in a mesmerizing, briskly paced, and smart thriller that relies on tension rather than violence to do its job.Redford is absolutely brilliant as lead character Turner, or Condor, a researcher who finds himself the unwilling participant of a dangerous spy game.  Redford and Pollack smartly infuse the character with both a devilish charm and occasional viciousness that makes a great contrast to the character's outward repression, and complicates his role as reluctant hero.  His dynamic with Faye Dunaway is an intriguing mix of sexual chemistry, confrontation and violation, and it makes the relationship far more interesting than most &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot; setups of this type.  Max von Sydow makes for a formidable, intelligent, and creepy opponent, and Pollack's shooting and editing are just about perfect.  Throughout the movie's substantial, sprawling plot, Pollack maintains a stifling sense of tension that engrosses you into continued attention.  True, I found myself quite lost in the maze of character relationships and motivations, but Pollack's dramatic sense is so unfailing that I never really care.Nearly as good as All the President's Men as far as political thrillers go -- and that's saying a lot.",5,Exceedingly well-crafted film.,1029456000,"08 16, 2002",2002,1501,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'picking', 'now', 'realize', 'had', 'been', 'missing', 'out', 'Three', 'Days', 'Condor', 'amazing', 'piece', 'work', 'participants', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'director', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'top', 'form', 'mesmerizing', 'briskly', 'paced', 'smart', 'thriller', 'tension', 'rather', 'violence', 'do', 'job.Redford', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'lead', 'character', 'Turner', 'Condor', 'researcher', 'who', 'unwilling', 'participant', 'dangerous', 'spy', 'game', 'Redford', 'Pollack', 'smartly', 'infuse', 'character', 'devilish', 'charm', 'occasional', 'viciousness', 'great', 'contrast', 'character', 'outward', 'repression', 'role', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'dynamic', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'intriguing', 'mix', 'sexual', 'chemistry', 'confrontation', 'violation', 'relationship', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'most', 'quot', 'Stockholm', 'Syndrome', 'quot', 'setups', 'type', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'formidable', 'intelligent', 'creepy', 'opponent', 'Pollack', 'shooting', 'editing', 'are', 'just', 'perfect', 'movie', 'substantial', 'sprawling', 'plot', 'Pollack', 'stifling', 'sense', 'tension', 'continued', 'attention', 'True', 'found', 'quite', 'lost', 'maze', 'character', 'relationships', 'motivations', 'Pollack', 'dramatic', 'sense', 'so', 'unfailing', 'never', 'really', 'care.Nearly', 'as', 'good', 'President', 'Men', 'as', 'far', 'political', 'thrillers', 'go', 'saying', 'lot']",Three Days of the Condor VHS

Great soundtrack, too.The times, they were a-changin'.... This time period was on the heels of Watergate and the Church Committee. We the people could believe almost anything about the duplicity of our politicians and government institutions. The CIA assassinating its own? Sure. Why not? It's not paranoia if they're really out to get you. Thus begins a race against time for Redford's character, Joe Turner, to root out the corruption and, not coincidentally, try to stay alive.Part of the plot suspense is watching Redford and Dunaway's characters evolve and try to figure out who to trust, including each other. There's a nice little twist involving Max von Sydow's character, Joubert. Then there's that ambiguous freeze-frame ending. Given the times, though, the heroes in popular culture were usually reporters (as in Redford's other high-profile role at the time, All the President's Men, directed by Alan Pakula). Speaking of reporters...This film makes a nice bookend to another classic '70s paranoid spy thriller starring Warren Beatty as... wait for it... a reporter! If you prefer your paranoia darker and more cynical, your multinational corporations even more corrupt than government agencies, your villains more transparently evil, then The Parallax View (also directed by Alan Pakula) is the film for you.

It has seemed realistic in that the number of people involved in the conspiracy was small, no one (not even those involved) really quite knew what was going on (or  much cared), and everything did not end cleanly.  The character played by Max von Sydow is one of my favorite villains, and the ""it will happen this way"" (about not accepting a ride) speech one of my favorite speeches.One quibble though: ladies too, do not get in the car! : If someone comes up to you and points a gun at you, throw the keys away, scream and run!  You may get shot, but the people around will call 911.  If you get in the car with him, even if he looks like Robert Redford, you will likely die after some very bad things happen to you.  Do NOT get in the car!Given today's technology compared to the antiquated systems in the film, this scenario could very well happen; and in fact, the central mystery which everyone was trying to hide HAS happened.

Since 1975, media as an information-gatherer has turned into propaganda machine with no courageous patriots within.Instead of hired assassins as instruments, ""the company"" just reads to an indifferent TV audience, more diverted by Britney, than the takeover of democracy. The reviewer of ""Shibumi"" had things right when relating that novel to this movie.I found it also interesting in light of 9/11 events, that the Cliff Robertson (CIA division head) was transported to his NY office in the Twin Towers, when he set out on capturing the elusive Condor. It is a thrilling ride from beginning to end with a surprising finish. Robertson's character makes a threat, but Condor(Redford)unflinchingly accepts his fate of remaining ""out there.""

A shroud of relentless paranoia permeates the entire film from beginning to end. It is set primarily in New York City and Washington DC and this adds to the drama in a very credible way. Robert Redford is a CIA research reader. He reads books and all forms of written material essentially looking for ideas that his branch may find useful. He reads everything and reports anything pertinent with his team he is stationed with. Things go very wrong and he soon finds that he is a man on the run and he is a target. Why? That is what he has to find out and turn his situation around if he can. Besides Robert Redford, the cast includes Faye Dunaway, Cliff Robertson, John Houseman, Patrick Gorman and Max von Sydow. Redford's character is full of energy and once he directs that energy for his very survival, he becomes a very formidable player in the world of covert affairs. Interestingly, Max von Sydow has such a subtle yet incredibly powerful screen presence. On screen he effortlessly puts Robert Redford's energy and daring aside with such ease that you will be amazed.

222619,A3FY3H6F4249E0,6300216748,Kathy W,"[0, 0]","This has been a favorite movie of mine for years.  This 1975 flick was right in keeping with the cold-war spy stuff that so permeated the lives of people at that time. I remember all the spy TV shows and spy movies. Heck, I even remember as a kid going down to the basement when the warning sirens went off (East Coast).  I think that was the 1950s. In the 70s, spies were heroes and covert activities were going on everywhere. I wanted to work for the CIA, too, just like in the movies. (I do work for the government, but not CIA.)Anyway, as you've probably read already, Redford is in his prime and is a spy (Joe Turner) working for the CIA.  He just reads books and analyzes them.  He looks for things that are out-of-place in the writings, which may point to a covert operation taking place somewhere in the world.  If he finds something, he writes a report and (as typical within the government) sends the report forward up the chain-of-command.Well, guess what?  He submits a report on something wierd he finds in the books, goes out to pick up lunch, and returns to find everybody in the library office whacked. This was a somewhat secure location, too. Necessity is the mother of invention, and since Joe Turner feels the need to stay alive, he calls in to Headquarters and goes on the run. As he starts running, he begins to realize that people are after him too.  He can no longer be sure who to trust. Joe's cover name is Condor, which he never thought he would use, and Condor becomes a cloak-and-dagger guy, on the run. He enlists the help of Kathy (Faye Dunaway), just someone he picked at random and sensed was harmless. The head bad guy cold-blooded-killer is Max von Sydow (Jobert), and he is outstanding, as always. Jobert really doesn't particularly care who he kills; it's just business. But somehow, you kind of like Jobert. Cliff Robertson works for the CIA as Wiggins and Condor is talking back and forth with Wiggins to try to get to safety somehow. Condor is running from Jobert (and others), hiding and running with Kathy, and trying to work something out with Wiggins.Well, remember that book report Condor wrote that we talked about in the beginning? Turns out there is something going on.  That's why all those people got whacked! (Duh). What's going on has a bunch of people involved, so there are twists and turns and surprises, and there is running and hiding and being clever all over the place.  Condor turns out to be quite clever because ""he reads books"" all the time. Well, knowledge is power.Great spy story.

Which is what a less loquacious Robert Redford tries to do after what may be one of the top ten movie opening scenes of all time, 70's, 80's, 90's or beyond.Earlier reviews have fairly well constructed and described the plot but what's interesting is the unbelievability of it. Sydney Pollack keeps the heat on and the emotional cul de sacs plentiful as Redford tries to whittle down not so much the who killed all his coworkers but the why.I believe alongside &quot;Bullit,&quot; &quot;French Connection,&quot; &quot;Body Heat&quot; and a few others, this is an essential movie both for it's time and our time. In light of Vietnam and Watergate, we just didn't blindly trust Uncle Sam anymore and were frequently reminded of the protest idiom, 'love your country; fear your government.' And for a captivating two hours, Redford is 'everyperson' ever profiled, searched, audited, traffic stopped, drafted and perhaps far worse. We didn't have to read George Orwell to know big brother was and is watching.Cliff Robertson, a gifted actor denied his peak years because of pseudo-administration influence (do you remember 'Flowers for Algernon/Charley?), ironically plays the government role, as you would expect, brilliantly, and Max Von Sydow, is as always, superlative. I agree with some of the criticism of Faye Dunaway. She did better in other roles than she did here.

All ideas are fed into a computer that compares with CIA plots and international issues and threats.  Joe is just a researcher, not a CIA Agent, but learns a lot about espionage, just reading books and other materials through his job.Joe is late to work one rainy day in December and his boss corners him to let him know that a letter he sent the Langley CIA office was dismissed.  Joe folds up the letter and puts it in his pants pocket to deal with later.  His letter noted a realization that strong relationships were developing between Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and other oil producing countries and thought it was worth the CIA's effort to look into it.We meet all of Joe's co-workers - 6 of them besides Joe.  He starts his work and feeds pertinent information into the computer.  Around 11:30 he is the designated person to do the lunch run to the Deli a block away. He ducks out a back entrance to avoid much of the rainy areas.  While he is gone, the mailman is rung in the front door security.  Other men come with him as they tear up the security tapes.  Everyone in the office is killed within minutes and the killers leave.  When Joe returns he finds the front door open and his co-workers shot.  He soon realizes this is a hit and takes the receptionist's gun to protect himself as he runs to a phone booth to call the main CIA office.His CIA code name is Condor - and he calls to give his section chief the information of the hit.  He is told not to hang up the phone and to call again in two hours.  The CIA ""clean-up"" team arrives within minutes to clear the carnage.  They verify the killings to the main office.  The New York section chief is stunned and wants to know why a research office would be gunned down.  He calls his supervisor at CIA Headquarters.Joe in the meantime is totally paranoid and dodges and hides until he is to be brought ""in from the cold"" - but realizes a set up in a back alley is meant to kill him.  The agents he was to meet are an old friend (he trusts) and another CIA department head.  He realizes his own department head is trying to kill him and shoots him with the gun he picked up.  The Department head then shoots the other unknowing agent (a friend that Joe trusted). Now Joe feels he can trust no one.  He is desperate and kidnaps a woman that he saw in a clothing store, Kathy (Faye Dunaway).  They drive to her apartment and she lets him hide there, although he uses the gun to scare her.  He just needs time to figure out what to do next.The plot thickens and the action escalates.  There are exciting twists and turns.  Eventually Joe has his revenge.

222651,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,6300216748,mirasreviews,"[2, 2]","""Three Days of the Condor"" is a political thriller released in 1975, based loosely on the novel ""Six Days of the Condor"" by James Brady. Joe Turner (Robert Redford), codename ""Condor"", works for the CIA researching foreign literature in New York City. Section 9 Department 17 has set up offices in a brownstone under the guise of the American Literary Historical Society. Joe recently sent a report to his superiors about a mystery novel that has been inexplicably translated into an odd assortment of languages despite its commercial failure. Joe goes out to pick up lunch for his co-workers. When he returns, he finds them all dead, murdered. He calls the CIA's ""panic office"" to report the incident, and they tell him that his superior in Washington, D.C., Wicks (Michael Kane), will bring him in. But Wicks tries to kill him, so Joe is on the run with no one to trust.This is one of those terrific political thrillers made in the 1970s on the heels of Watergate, the Vietnam War, and the oil crisis that capitalized on the public's distrust of government. The CIA is plagued with rogue operations and morally bankrupt. The intelligence community just plays games, as Deputy Director Higgins (Cliff Robertson) explains to Joe. The good guys use the same methods, and often the same ""free-lancers"", as the bad guys. The assassin responsible for the carnage, Joubert (Max von Sydow), is the ultimate pragmatist. He has no need to believe in a side. He takes no interest in his employers and believes only in his work. Morally bankrupt, he is the only player with an objective viewpoint. The CIA is portrayed as a bastion of cynicism more than an agency of Cold Warriors.Watching ""Three Days of the Condor"" in 2011, I was forced to conclude that reality is darker than leftist filmmakers of the 1970s imagined. That surprised me. Of course, the real CIA is not so goofy as to countenance high-level rogues who massacre their own agents in the middle of Manhattan. But I was taken aback when Higgins says that the American public would not object to the invasion of a Middle Eastern nation if we ran out of oil or, worse, food. In reality, it didn't take nearly that much for Americans to approve a war or two in the Middle East. Watching these old movies reminds me of how different global politics was during the Cold War, when the competition of two superpowers constrained their options to a large extent. And Joe's thinking is that the New York Times, freedom of the press incarnate, will save the day. No one would think that now.There is a charming naivet&eacute; amid ""Three Days of the Condor""'s over-the-top cynicism. And Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway, who plays Kathy Hale, a woman whom Joe abducts on the street because he requires the use of her car, make a good-looking couple. For a man who's not a field agent -he just reads books- Joe is pretty good at phone hacking and breaking and entering. This is a paranoid political thriller, but it's smart, tightly written, and an interesting trip back to the skeptical 1970s. The DVD (Paramount 2006) includes a theatrical trailer (3 min).

Robert Redford plays such a great role.  Your classic hero who is not a macho guy but is smart and doesn't play by the rules.  The story touches on many of the fears we have today about Big Brother operating illegally within our country and what could happen if you expose any of it.  Robert Redford's character gets caught in the middle as a reader for the CIA, a seemingly mundane, safe job.  He stumbles onto something he shouldn't have uncovered.

222664,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,6300216748,OverTheMoon,"[6, 8]","The strength of 3 Days of the Condor is in the role of CIA agent Condor, Joe Turner played by Robert Redford, a book reader for the CIA who finds the organisation he works for suddenly whipped out by a ruthless bunch of assassins led by the German Joubert, Max Von Sydow, in a famous sequence that is almost prophetic of the office rampages we hear about today in the news. Quickly phoning HQ, Condor is ordered to rendezvous with a pickup only to be speedily thrown into a game of cat and mouse with shadow agencies and his own competing against one another. Although there are some surprises in store, plot twists and the memorable tense elevator scene (did you drop these gloves sir?), 3 Days of the Condor is sadly let down by a lack of depth in the plot and some unconventional breaks in the pace, such as the overlong kidnapping background love story with Kathy, Faye Dunaway, and the Scooby-doo explanation ending that never really seems to answer much, leaving the viewer with a sort of half-satisfied explanation for the high body count shadow operations being witnessed. Although playing itself somewhat well to the tune of cold war atmosphere, this `man on the run' leaves many loose ends open and much to the imagination. This is mostly due to the very interesting confrontation between Turner and Joubert that is downplayed by the final scene where Condor confronts his boss.With a high television replay count 3 Days of the Condor has shown itself to be a very popular movie and Redford does his bit well, bringing out the bookworm's military manoeuvres now and again, this is a 70s conspiracy thriller highlight, although there are now better and deeper movies that revolve around the same theme.

While it probably seemed groundbreaking and fresh in 1975, three decades of similarly plotted movies have dulled Condor's edge.Robert Redford plays an agent, code name &quot;Condor,&quot; who works in a scholarly-appearing CIA front organization in New York that analyzes world literature for significant patterns (whose significance to the spook agency isn't spelled out very convincingly). While he goes to the deli to pick up lunch for his crew, a team of assassins gains entry to the office and wipes out all of his colleagues there, as well as another who is at home. Redford, realizing he was supposed to be among the victims, goes on the run and plays cat-and-mouse with various CIA officers, any of whom could be behind the killings.He chooses at random a woman photographer (Faye Dunaway) as his unwilling accomplice while hiding and trying to penetrate the evil cabal within the &quot;Company.&quot; In one of the screen's unlikeliest romances, Dunaway finds her fear and distrust of Redford's character yielding to belief in his story and then a dangerous liaison with him.The director, Sydney Pollack, has often blended the elements of commercial cinema with intelligence and taste (e.g., Out of Africa).  This is another such attempt, but not one of his better efforts. The genre has worn thin, as noted earlier, and the script staggers from cliche to cliche. I won't be giving away anything important if I tell you that the denouement is, yes, &quot;It's all about ... oil!&quot;I am usually unable to warm to Redford, and this was no exception. There is no &quot;there&quot; there, as Gertrude Stein said about Oakland. He strikes poses and lets his golden hair do his acting for him. There is also a featured (but minor) role for John Houseman as a sour, cold-eyed case officer. He lays it on thick.Still, several of the performances give Condor what distinction it has. Dunaway is better than I would have expected, quite credible and sometimes touching as a lonely introvert. Cliff Robertson, one of the underestimated actors of the '60s and early '70s (what ever happened to him?), is strong as the CIA officer assigned to &quot;bring in&quot; Condor. Best of all is the great Max von Sydow, who starred in many of Ingmar Bergman's films, playing a freelance assassin. Watch how a master actor makes a meal out of a feebly written part.Several scenes were shot outside and inside the World Trade Center, which was then brand new.

He must figure out how to fend for himself, and he does so effectively and even brilliantly, first hiding and then figuring out what is happening and who is responsible.  He is wonderfully believable, even when he becomes deadly.  Faye Dunaway is brilliantly convincing as the beautiful lost soul who eventually helps him, a lonely artist he meets in a chance encounter.  But the resolution is also a jarring surprise, which I shuld not reveal here.

What sets this film apart from most others in its genre is the introduction of  a guileless central character (Joe Turner played by Robert Redford) who seems to pose no threat to anyone and yet he becomes involved in a deadly situation which neither he nor we understand. Director Sydney Pollack was perhaps influenced by Alfred Hitchcock who, in so many of his own films, subjects an innocent person to undefined but nonetheless nerve-chilling terror. After obtaining take-out lunches for himself and his associates, Turner returns to their small office in Manhattan and finds all of them dead. What happened? Who did it? Why? The situation is complicated by the fact that he and they are employed by the C.I.A. There is no indication that their research has any special significance. Security precautions for their office seem perfunctory. Turner flees the scene, later meeting with his supervisor Higgins (Cliff Robertson). After someone attempts to kill Turner, he again calls Higgins who urges him to ""come in."" By now, Turner correctly senses that he is in great danger but from whom? Why? What to do? He also realizes that he can no longer trust anyone, including Higgins. Still in flight, he (his code name ""Condor"") enlists the reluctant assistance of a stranger named Kathy (Faye Dunaway) who becomes his only ally. Enough about the plot.Based on James Grady's novel Six Days of the Condor, this is one of several films from the 1970s which portray distrust of institutional authority because of various assassinations, the Viet Nam War, and Watergate. However, it is important to keep in mind that Joe Turner is not a major political or religious leader; rather, he is a relatively insignificant research analyst in a relatively insignificant C.I.A. field office. For me, the key point is that literally anyone anywhere can be selected for elimination at any time. Worse yet, we won't know who's involved, much less why. Redford delivers a solid performance as Turner, the focal point throughout the film. As for Dunaway, she does what she can with Kathy, not much of a part. Of special note is the work of Max von Sydow (as Joubert) and John Houseman (as Wabash). Theirs is a cold-blooded professionalism which views people merely as ""assets"" to accumulate or liquidate per orders from unidentified authorities. This is not the best of the political thrillers but it does portray some thought-provoking situations which still seem relevant 28 years later.",4,"Why?

222699,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,6300216748,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[0, 0]","liked the first act, Robert Redford is great, but couldn't buy the Faye Dunaway character as bound-captive-to-sex-partner-to-kidnapper accomplice, not as written, and not over the course of a few days. first, you're a woman living alone and a man kidnaps you. terrifying, absolutely terrifying. you don't know whether he will cut you into little tiny pieces and that you'll never be heard from again. then, in the course of that kidnapping, you and he have sex. the film shows it to be consensual, but I so do not believe that. I'm a woman. Robert Redford is one of the most handsome men I've ever seen, but I don't care if the most handsome, seductive angel came down from heaven (for the sake of this argument, let's agree that there are angels and that there is a heaven), I am not having sex with him. a person would be too traumatized from being bound and kidnapped to be able to make a sensible decision. the Faye Dunaway character is too traumatized to make a rational decision with regards to taking a lover and so, to me, their intercourse is a continuation of the Robert Redford character's violence against her. then, after apparently enjoying sex with him, and after they are both attacked by a hitman and Robert Redford protects her, she believes what he's been telling her and agrees to help him, instead of escaping. hogwash. a more believable story would've been to not have these two characters have sex. he could have kidnapped her, which would've been bad enough, gone to her apartment and everything could've played out except for the sex. then have the hitman attack them at the apartment. somehow have the Faye Dunaway character no longer bound (the storytellers would have to figure how this happened), and after the Faye Dunaway character sees for herself that he's telling the truth, and see's that he protected her during the attack, it'd be okay for her to lose some of her fear of him, but not all her fear because she wouldn't know this guy and what is going on; heck even he doesn't know what's going on. And for sure, she would not agree to help him kidnap another person; how the writer even came up with that is beyond me. A victimized woman, morphs into a lover, morphs into a criminal herself? On what basis? She'd have to be established as a risk taker for this to be even remotely believable. Robert Redford is handsome in this movie, but there is not a man handsome enough to move a rational lawabiding woman not under the influence of drugs, into a criminal after one sexual experience over the course of a day or two - and especially not a woman the age of the character Ms. Dunaway plays in this film: she's at least 35 and long past the age of silly romanticism and ignorance of men. Thirty five year old women are not experts on men, but the average 35 year old woman would not behave as the Faye Dunaway character behaves with regards to having sex with her kidnapper and after a day or two helping him kidnap another. She has her own apartment, presumably her own income, appears to be sane and not on drugs, so why in the world would she throw in her lot with him? makes no sense. So her character kills this story for me even though the actors/actresses are all great. 2 and 1/2 stars.",2,didn't work for me (spoilers)...,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,3232,"['liked', 'first', 'act', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'great', 'could', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'character', 'bound-captive-to-sex-partner-to-kidnapper', 'accomplice', 'not', 'written', 'not', 'course', 'few', 'days', 'first', ""'re"", 'woman', 'living', 'alone', 'man', 'terrifying', 'absolutely', 'terrifying', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'will', 'cut', 'little', 'tiny', 'pieces', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'heard', 'again', 'then', 'course', 'kidnapping', 'have', 'sex', 'film', 'be', 'consensual', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'believe', ""'m"", 'woman', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'one', 'most', 'handsome', 'men', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'most', 'handsome', 'seductive', 'angel', 'came', 'down', 'heaven', 'sake', 'argument', 'let', 'agree', 'are', 'angels', 'heaven', 'am', 'not', 'having', 'sex', 'person', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'traumatized', 'being', 'bound', 'kidnapped', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'sensible', 'decision', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'character', 'too', 'traumatized', 'make', 'rational', 'decision', 'regards', 'taking', 'lover', 'so', 'intercourse', 'continuation', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'character', 'violence', 'then', 'apparently', 'enjoying', 'sex', 'are', 'attacked', 'hitman', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'what', 'been', 'telling', 'help', 'instead', 'escaping', 'hogwash', 'more', 'believable', 'story', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'not', 'have', 'two', 'characters', 'have', 'sex', 'could', 'have', 'kidnapped', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'bad', 'enough', 'gone', 'apartment', 'everything', 'could', ""'ve"", 'played', 'out', 'sex', 'then', 'have', 'hitman', 'attack', 'apartment', 'somehow', 'have', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'character', 'no', 'longer', 'bound', 'storytellers', 'would', 'have', 'figure', 'how', 'happened', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'character', 'sees', 'herself', 'telling', 'truth', 'see', 'protected', 'attack', ""'d"", 'be', 'okay', 'lose', 'fear', 'not', 'fear', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'guy', 'what', 'going', 'heck', 'even', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'going', 'sure', 'would', 'not', 'agree', 'help', 'kidnap', 'person', 'how', 'writer', 'even', 'came', 'up', 'victimized', 'woman', 'morphs', 'lover', 'morphs', 'criminal', 'herself', 'what', 'basis', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'established', 'risk', 'taker', 'be', 'even', 'remotely', 'believable', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'handsome', 'movie', 'not', 'man', 'enough', 'move', 'rational', 'lawabiding', 'woman', 'not', 'influence', 'drugs', 'criminal', 'one', 'sexual', 'experience', 'course', 'day', 'two', 'especially', 'not', 'woman', 'age', 'character', 'Ms.', 'Dunaway', 'film', 'least', '35', 'long', 'age', 'silly', 'romanticism', 'ignorance', 'men', 'Thirty', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'women', 'are', 'not', 'experts', 'men', 'average', '35', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'would', 'not', 'behave', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'character', 'behaves', 'regards', 'having', 'sex', 'kidnapper', 'day', 'two', 'helping', 'kidnap', 'own', 'apartment', 'presumably', 'own', 'income', 'be', 'sane', 'not', 'drugs', 'so', 'why', 'world', 'would', 'throw', 'lot', 'sense', 'character', 'story', 'even', 'actors/actresses', 'are', 'great', '2', '1/2', 'stars']",Three Days of the Condor VHS
222700,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,6300216748,Stanley Crowe,"[0, 0]","Sidney Pollack's 1975 ""Three Days of the Condor"" is an effectively slick contribution to two of the sub-genres of thriller -- the trials and tribulations of the low-level operative who discovers a conspiracy, and the story of an apparently ordinary man who finds within himself unlikely resources and skills.  The protagonist of this mixture is Joe Turner (Robert Redford), a desk-bound low-level CIA operative who does nothing but read (anything, everything) and look for clues about possible encoded enemy plans that might harm the US.  He finds something worth reporting and reports it, and in pretty short order, all members of the team with whom he works are killed, Joe himself being lucky enough to have been out of the office buying lunch for his group.  He discovers the carnage when he gets back with the sandwiches.  Joe knows the chain of command to which he reports, so he figures out that something is rotten in ""the company"" and he takes steps to find out what that is before he can be tracked down by the hit squad who killed his fellow-workers.  It's a situation where, although he is in touch with his chain of command, he fears that he cannot trust any of them.  The suspense of the movie comes from the ingenious and very careful ways in which Joe protects himself, while making progress on finding out what's going on.  I'll say no more about the plot, in case there are folks out there who have yet to see the movie, beyond saying that it is well-worked out and that the suspense is well-maintained.  Redford is hardly stretched by the demands of the role, but he is effective and appealing as the puzzled and antsy hero.The plot has affinities with Le Carre's kind of stories from the 1970's, but where in Le Carre one is made aware not only of the issues of trust but of the morally compromised status of the ""good guys,"" in this movie the focus is exclusively on trust, and it remains so until the end.  The trust issue plays most obviously into the suspensefulness of the movie, and that is where Pollack is happy to leave it.  What makes the movie a bit more than just a well-oiled piece of machinery, however, is the role of Kathy Hale (Faye Dunaway), a woman whom Joe grabs at gunpoint and forces to drive him to a safe place.  He has to convince her that he's on the side of the angels, and eventually she believes him and becomes his abettor in his scheme to get at the truth.  Kathy is a photographer, who seems to be in a troubled relationship.  A history is hinted that gives her the possibility of a bit more depth than the other characters, and Dunaway suggests that quality of interestingness by look and gesture -- she is arguably the most interesting character in the movie.The other potentially interesting character is Joubert, a hit man (arrestingly played by Max von Sydow).  His relation to the CIA is one of the things that Joe has to figure out to protect his own life.  I say ""potentially interesting"" because the part is underwritten -- deliberately, I think, to enable a twist at the end to be brought off.  So . . . an entertaining movie, with good music (Dave Grusin) and some lovely New York and Brooklyn settings.  It resists being what we would now call an ""action movie,"" and that's all to the good.",4,entertaining and suspenseful (and Faye Dunaway),1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,3254,"['Sidney', 'Pollack', '1975', 'Three', 'Days', 'Condor', 'effectively', 'slick', 'contribution', 'two', 'sub-genres', 'thriller', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'low-level', 'operative', 'who', 'conspiracy', 'story', 'apparently', 'ordinary', 'man', 'who', 'unlikely', 'resources', 'skills', 'protagonist', 'mixture', 'Joe', 'Turner', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'desk-bound', 'low-level', 'CIA', 'operative', 'who', 'nothing', 'read', 'anything', 'everything', 'look', 'clues', 'possible', 'encoded', 'enemy', 'plans', 'might', 'harm', 'US', 'something', 'worth', 'reporting', 'reports', 'pretty', 'short', 'order', 'members', 'team', 'whom', 'are', 'killed', 'Joe', 'being', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'been', 'office', 'buying', 'lunch', 'group', 'carnage', 'when', 'back', 'sandwiches', 'Joe', 'chain', 'command', 'out', 'something', 'rotten', 'company', 'steps', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'tracked', 'down', 'hit', 'squad', 'who', 'killed', 'fellow-workers', 'situation', 'where', 'touch', 'chain', 'command', 'can', 'not', 'trust', 'suspense', 'movie', 'ingenious', 'very', 'careful', 'ways', 'Joe', 'making', 'progress', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'going', ""'ll"", 'say', 'no', 'more', 'plot', 'case', 'are', 'folks', 'who', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'movie', 'saying', 'well-worked', 'suspense', 'well-maintained', 'Redford', 'hardly', 'stretched', 'demands', 'role', 'effective', 'appealing', 'puzzled', 'antsy', 'hero.The', 'plot', 'affinities', 'Le', 'Carre', 'kind', 'stories', '1970', 'where', 'Le', 'Carre', 'one', 'made', 'aware', 'not', 'only', 'issues', 'trust', 'morally', 'compromised', 'status', 'good', 'guys', 'movie', 'focus', 'exclusively', 'trust', 'so', 'end', 'trust', 'issue', 'most', 'obviously', 'suspensefulness', 'movie', 'where', 'Pollack', 'happy', 'leave', 'What', 'movie', 'bit', 'more', 'just', 'well-oiled', 'piece', 'machinery', 'however', 'role', 'Kathy', 'Hale', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'woman', 'whom', 'Joe', 'grabs', 'gunpoint', 'forces', 'drive', 'safe', 'place', 'convince', 'side', 'angels', 'eventually', 'abettor', 'scheme', 'get', 'truth', 'Kathy', 'photographer', 'who', 'be', 'troubled', 'relationship', 'history', 'hinted', 'possibility', 'bit', 'more', 'depth', 'other', 'characters', 'Dunaway', 'quality', 'interestingness', 'look', 'gesture', 'arguably', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'movie.The', 'other', 'potentially', 'interesting', 'character', 'Joubert', 'hit', 'man', 'arrestingly', 'played', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'relation', 'CIA', 'one', 'things', 'Joe', 'figure', 'out', 'protect', 'own', 'life', 'say', 'potentially', 'interesting', 'part', 'underwritten', 'deliberately', 'think', 'enable', 'twist', 'end', 'be', 'brought', 'off', 'So', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'good', 'music', 'Dave', 'Grusin', 'lovely', 'New', 'York', 'Brooklyn', 'settings', 'being', 'what', 'would', 'now', 'call', 'action', 'movie', 'good']",Three Days of the Condor VHS

Turner and his literary colleagues are also non-practicing CIA agents with Turner having the code name ""Condor.""On this particular day it was Turner's turn to pick up lunch for the others at the office.  He exits through a rear door of the ALHS to do so.  On returning with lunch he finds all his colleagues murdered.  He now runs for his life.Turner reports this massacre to his superior (Cliff Robertson), a man he has never met.  He suddenly finds himself the target of both his employers and the unknown murderers of his associates.  He randomly abducts a lonely photographer (Faye Dunaway) who is forced to hide him and later helps him discover the answer to the following question:""What's the secret worth murdering everybody at the ALHS house?""This movie was an unexpected surprise for me.  While starting out tame, it turns into an intense thriller with excellent acting.  Redford, Robertson, and Dunaway give good performances.  However, my biggest kudos must go to someone I never mentioned in the above summary--Max von Sydow who ruthlessly and chillingly plays a maverick hit man.The background music adds to each scene.  I found the cinematography of mid-seventies New York interesting.Finally, the DVD (the one released Aug. 1999) is perfect in picture and sound quality.

Travers,"[1, 16]","Robert Redford made a clunker called ""The Way We Were"" with Barbra Streisand that desperately tried to explain, apologize for, justify, glorify and approve of being an American Communist during McCarthyism, but just plain fails. He made the 1973 classic ""Three Days of the Condor"" (1973), with Cliff Robertson and Faye Dunnaway. He plays a CIA reader, a kind of pre-Tom Clancy research guy, a benign fellow among other benign CIA fellows, all of whom are murdered in a fuzzily explained hit by bad CIA fellows. After escaping, Redford tries to get to the bottom of it. Since he is a genius he has the intellectual tools to outwit his chasers. This is the film's highlight, revolving around the sexual tension between Redford and the redoubtable Faye, who he ""kidnaps"" in order to have a place to hide out, her apartment. The movie goes off the deep when the whole conspiracy turns out to be about the CIA's covert operations in the Middle East, where the U.S. apparently is planning the invasion (that never actually occurred) to take over OPEC.

222706,A1QWEUEM90LL9D,6300216748,"Steven Travers ""AUTHOR/WRITER""","[5, 9]","Robert Redford made a clunker called ""The Way We Were"" with Barbra Streisand that desperately tried to explain, apologize for, justify, glorify and approve of being an American Communist during McCarthyism, but just plain fails. He made the 1973 classic ""Three Days of the Condor"" (1973), with Cliff Robertson and Faye Dunnaway. He plays a CIA reader, a kind of pre-Tom Clancy research guy, a benign fellow among other benign CIA fellows, all of whom are murdered in a fuzzily explained hit by bad CIA fellows. After escaping, Redford tries to get to the bottom of it. Since he is a genius he has the intellectual tools to outwit his chasers. This is the film's highlight, revolving around the sexual tension between Redford and the redoubtable Faye, who he ""kidnaps"" in order to have a place to hide out, her apartment. The movie goes off the deep when the whole conspiracy turns out to be about the CIA's covert operations in the Middle East, where the U.S. apparently is planning the invasion (that never actually occurred) to take over OPEC. The message is that The Company murders innocents, the U.S. is a warmongering empire, and tool of capitalist greed.

222709,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,6300216748,Themis-Athena,"[8, 10]","In his 1979 novel ""Shibumi"" (part political thriller, part cynical attack on Western civilization and part satire of the thriller genre), written at the end of that genre's possibly greatest decade, Trevanian explains the six parts of the Japanese board game symbolizing the concept of effortless perfection and inspiring that novel's title: Fuseki (the opening stage or strategic premise), Sabaki (an effort to quickly, efficiently terminate a problematic situation), Seki (a neutral standoff where neither side gains an advantage), Uttegae (a potentially sacrificial strategic maneuver), Shicho (a running offensive) and Tsuru no Sugomori (literally, ""the confinement of the cranes to their nest:"" the elegant capture of the opponent's stones).Like other books published then and influenced by the shocking Watergate revelations, ""Shibumi"" asks what happens if government is hijacked by a secret association not bound by anything but its own interests and hunger for power.  One of the most important novels on whose legacy Trevanian builds in his book is James Grady's ""Six Days of the Condor,"" adapted for the screen by director Sydney Pollack in this hugely successful fourth (of seven) collaboration(s) with Robert Redford; costarring Faye Dunaway, Max von Sydow and Cliff Robertson.  But while Grady's novel centered around the Vietnam trauma, the movie's screenplay, besides shortening the critical time frame from six days to three, changes the focus to the era's obsession with oil; thus effortlessly proving one of the story's key points:  Assuming a group of insiders truly managed to commandeer key governmental structures, the respective substantive context would be of little import, because *any* such action would constitute a terminal violation of public trust, and the consequences for any individual caught in the resulting web of intrigue and deceit would be equally disastrous.""Three Days of the Condor"" begins with the assassination of virtually the entire staff of a New York CIA office of ""reader researchers,"" agents responsible for the detection of possible clues to actual or potential Agency operations in literature.  The massacre's sole survivor is Joe Turner, codenamed ""Condor"" (Redford), who literally happened to be out to lunch when the assassins hit.  After his discovery of the bloodbath, his superiors promise to bring him ""home,"" using his inside friend Sam as a confidence-builder.  But at the assigned meeting Sam is shot, too, and Turner himself only escapes by the skin of his teeth - again.  Realizing that his own organization is somehow involved in the hit and that he is no longer safe in his own apartment, Turner hides in the home of photographer Kathy Hale (Dunaway), whom he takes hostage, but who is a loner like him and eventually develops a fondness for him, agreeing to help him trying to discover the truth behind the terrifying labyrinth of lies and double standards in which he suddenly finds himself.While ""Condor""'s tale does have a clear premise (the interests of those responsible for the massacre) and both the mass-assassination and the following events are merely moves in the lethal game into which Turner is thrown against his will (and where his greatest advantage is his unpredictability), against the overbearing opponent he faces, he alone has little chances of emerging victoriously; of, in the terminology of Shibumi, ""confining the cranes to their nest:""  All he can hope for is a long-lasting state of Seki; a standoff and perhaps temporary ceasefire (a conclusion later also reached in John Grisham's bestselling ""The Firm"").  The inference, of course, is that it takes more than a single individual's discovery of a government-undermining conspiracy to take down the conspirators - and as in Watergate, the press is seen as a crucial vehicle for reaching a mass audience and taking the events out of the perpetrators' control.Due to the universality of its theme, the importance of ""Condor"" far exceeds the story's 1970s context.  Indeed, it is as relevant now as it was then; and so is the Pulitzer-Prize-winning Woodward-Bernstein account on Watergate and its corresponding movie (""All the President's Men;"" also starring Redford, alongside Dustin Hoffman and Jason Robards).  But this is also a magnificently filmed movie, sharply edited and using New York City's wintry urban landscape for full dramatic effect.  Robert Redford gives a career-defining, tightly controlled performance as cornered bookworm-turned-spy Joe Turner, matched in every respect by Max von Sydow's hired assassin Joubert, who has no cause of his own, finds his occupation ""quite restful,"" never concerns himself with his missions' ""why"" but only the ""when,"" ""where"" and ""how much,"" and paints delicate little figurines in his hours of relaxation.  Faye Dunaway's Kathy is not merely another victim of Stockholm syndrome (a hostage's identification with their captors' motives); she truly comes to understand Turner because of their likeness:  Her photos are expressions of her loneliness as much as Joe's solitary stance against an entire governmental organization; beautiful but sad November pictures of empty streets, fields and park benches, shot in black and white and an intricate, subtle metaphor even during their love scene.  Cliff Robertson's CIA man Higgins finally is the perfect foil for both Turner and Joubert; not as far along in his career as he should be but, although sympathetic to Turner's plight, fully buying into the legitimacy of the Agency's ""games"" and ready to do whatever it takes to keep an embarrassment from becoming conspicuous.Turner's and Higgins's last meeting is poignantly set against a Salvation Army choir's performance of ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"" and its chorus ""Oh tidings of comfort and joy;"" ending in a still shot of Turner's face starkly reminiscent of Kathy's photos.  Yet, ""Condor's"" story is open-ended:  What would he do, were he still around today?""What is it with you people - do you think not getting caught in a lie is the same thing as telling the truth?""  Joe Turner, ""Three Days of the Condor.""""All ... organizations in this book lack any basis in reality - although some of them do not realize that.""

Robert Redford (Brubaker,The Hot Rock,The Natural, Spy Game, The Sting, The Way We Were) plays a CIA employee, who unexpectedly has to draw on all that he has learned, in order to keep himself alive.Joseph Turner (Redford) works for a CIA unit assigned to glean through books and periodicals looking for signs of anything nefarious or suspicious.  Operating out of a low profile office in New York City, Turner leaves the building to get lunch for his co-workers.  When he returns, finds that they have all been shot dead.Following protocol, a shaken Turner phones the CIA, and identifies himself by his codename ""Condor"".  Eventually he speaks to deputy director Higgins (Cliff Robertson), who arranges a meeting to bring Turner into headquarters.  The rendezvous in a back alley turns out to be a double-cross, but the bookwormish Condor manages to shoot his would be assassin.Desperate, and in need of a place to hide, Turner abducts a woman named Kathy Hale (Faye Dunaway), and forces her to take him to her home.  Turner later ties Kathy up, and leaves to visit someone that he feels may be in danger.  On this excursion he meets Joubert (Max von Sydow), the leader of the hit squad that murdered his friends.  Joubert is there to kill him, but Turner's remarkable instincts for survival once again saves his life, and eventually leads to his uncovering the truth.Three Days of the Condor is a brilliant mix of violence, paranoia, and intrigue, that fits perfectly within context of the cover-ups and political dirty tricks of the Watergate era.  The dialog is sharp, and always appropriate.  The story is nicely paced, and mostly stays within the bounds of reality, with the major weak point perhaps being the relationship that so quickly develops between Hale and Turner, as she becomes an overly willing ally.  With an amazing ability to put the pieces together, and adapt to various situations, Turner is someone that you get totally behind.The cast is loaded with Academy Award winners and nominees.  Robert Redford gives a brilliant and believable performance, as a desperate and resourceful, man on the run.  The perfectly cast Max von Sydow (The Exorcist, The Quiller Memorandum), is fabulous.  Faye Dunaway (Bonnie and Clyde, Network, Chinatown, The Thomas Crown Affair,The Eyes Of Laura Mars) demonstrates again why she was one of the top actresses of her era.  Cliff Robertson (Man on a Swing) is solid as a CIA company man, while John Houseman (The Paper Chase) has a small supporting role.Lacking the pyrotechnics of a modern thriller, Three Days of the Condor may seems a bit tame, and the film's ambiguous ending may not completely satisfy, but the story plays out in a very realistic manner for 1975, again harkening back to Watergate, where the efforts of Washington Post reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, eventually led to the resignation of a President.",5,"Three Days of the Condor, a taught edgy thriller that follows in the shadows of real events...",1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,3126,"['Based', 'novel', 'Six', 'Days', 'Condor', 'James', 'Grady', 'timeframe', 'accelerated', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Three', 'Days', 'Condor', '1975', 'masterful', '70', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'directed', 'Sidney', 'Pollack', 'Frim', 'Yakuza', 'Tootsie', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Brubaker', 'Hot', 'Rock', 'Natural', 'Spy', 'Game', 'Sting', 'Way', 'Were', 'CIA', 'employee', 'who', 'unexpectedly', 'draw', 'learned', 'order', 'keep', 'alive.Joseph', 'Turner', 'Redford', 'CIA', 'unit', 'assigned', 'glean', 'books', 'periodicals', 'looking', 'signs', 'anything', 'nefarious', 'suspicious', 'Operating', 'low', 'profile', 'office', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Turner', 'building', 'get', 'lunch', 'co-workers', 'When', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'dead.Following', 'protocol', 'shaken', 'Turner', 'CIA', 'identifies', 'codename', 'Condor', 'Eventually', 'deputy', 'director', 'Higgins', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'who', 'meeting', 'bring', 'Turner', 'headquarters', 'rendezvous', 'back', 'alley', 'out', 'be', 'double-cross', 'bookwormish', 'Condor', 'shoot', 'would', 'be', 'assassin.Desperate', 'need', 'place', 'hide', 'Turner', 'woman', 'named', 'Kathy', 'Hale', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'take', 'home', 'Turner', 'later', 'ties', 'Kathy', 'up', 'visit', 'someone', 'may', 'be', 'danger', 'excursion', 'Joubert', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'leader', 'hit', 'squad', 'murdered', 'friends', 'Joubert', 'there', 'kill', 'Turner', 'remarkable', 'instincts', 'survival', 'once', 'again', 'life', 'eventually', 'uncovering', 'truth.Three', 'Days', 'Condor', 'brilliant', 'mix', 'violence', 'paranoia', 'intrigue', 'perfectly', 'context', 'cover-ups', 'political', 'dirty', 'tricks', 'Watergate', 'era', 'dialog', 'sharp', 'always', 'appropriate', 'story', 'nicely', 'paced', 'mostly', 'stays', 'bounds', 'reality', 'major', 'weak', 'point', 'perhaps', 'being', 'relationship', 'so', 'quickly', 'Hale', 'Turner', 'overly', 'willing', 'ally', 'amazing', 'ability', 'put', 'pieces', 'together', 'adapt', 'various', 'situations', 'Turner', 'someone', 'get', 'totally', 'behind.The', 'cast', 'loaded', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winners', 'nominees', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'brilliant', 'believable', 'performance', 'desperate', 'resourceful', 'man', 'run', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'Exorcist', 'Quiller', 'Memorandum', 'fabulous', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Network', 'Chinatown', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'Eyes', 'Laura', 'Mars', 'again', 'why', 'was', 'one', 'top', 'actresses', 'era', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Man', 'Swing', 'solid', 'CIA', 'company', 'man', 'John', 'Houseman', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'small', 'supporting', 'role.Lacking', 'pyrotechnics', 'modern', 'thriller', 'Three', 'Days', 'Condor', 'may', 'bit', 'tame', 'film', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'may', 'not', 'completely', 'satisfy', 'story', 'out', 'very', 'realistic', 'manner', '1975', 'again', 'harkening', 'back', 'Watergate', 'where', 'efforts', 'Washington', 'Post', 'reporters', 'Carl', 'Bernstein', 'Bob', 'Woodward', 'eventually', 'led', 'resignation', 'President']",Three Days of the Condor VHS

222735,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,6300216748,William Hare,"[1, 1]","The spy adventure film ""Three Days of the Condor"" was released in 1975.  This was a period when the American government and the commercial sector were in a panic over our access to oil.  This was when President Gerald Ford, mindful of the power of the Oil Producing Export Countries, announced that in the future we might actually consider taking oil by force if it should be denied to America.On the subject of Ford, we know that he followed Nixon, and that it was just one year before ""Condor"" was released that Ford's predecessor resigned in disgrace.  What did him in?  The Watergate Scandal.  What was that?  A series of clandestine activities, which once again lead back to the central point that this was a timely film.Why is ""Three Days of the Condor"" even more timely today?  Because of all that we have been through and what we know about the CIA and its clandestine activities that we did not know then.  We have experienced 9/11 and skepticism increases over its causes and who put the plan into effect, much like those same questions being asked about the assassination of President Kennedy.The reason why this film is even timelier today and can be better understood in a context better than three decades after its initial release is that we are much better informed about a major point discovered by Robert Redford, a book reader for the CIA who goes by the code name of Condor, is that there is an official CIA and another CIA.  Often the latter will superimpose itself on the former.  John Le Carre made the same point relative to MI5 in British intelligence.Redford, working out of a New York office purporting to be an historical society, leaves one afternoon to order and bring back lunch for himself and the rest of the crew.  After a little chitchat at the restaurant he returns to discover that everyone in the office has been fatally shot.Just where does he go from here?  Redford explains on the phone to headquarters that he is no agent, and is just a research man who reads books and makes recommendations.  He hopes to be brought in before he meets with the same fate as his office colleagues.A smooth and suave Cliff Robertson is his contact operating out of the CIA's main headquarters in Langley, Virginia.  When it is arranged for a station chief to come to New York to ""bring him in,"" more trouble ensues.  Redford has every reason to wonder if he has any allies left in ""The Company"" as he runs away from tragedy once more.In an effort to secure at least temporary safety Redford kidnaps Faye Dunaway after she leaves a store where he has gone to temporarily hide from pursuers.  A professional photographer who lives in Brooklyn, Dunaway at first resists Redford, but ultimately becomes an ally when she realizes that he is telling the truth and his life is in danger.At one point Dunaway tells Redford that she is afraid to get to know him since he is not going to live very long.  He disagrees, telling her that sense of danger is a driving interest force within her toward him.  Ultimately they became romantically involved and she is willing to accompany him to Langley so he can confront Robertson.The film was released not long after Daniel Ellsberg became famous for leaking what came to be known as the Pentagon Papers.  In a fascinating twist at the end of the film, Redford uses the New York Times as a type of insurance policy.Some of the film's most dramatic scenes involve Redford and Robertson, with the former speaking for the best of America as he states the case for decency and accountability in government while the latter states the proposition for secrecy and an ""end justifies the means"" mentality.Sydney Pollack in his director's role keeps the pacing fast as befitting a spy mystery involving pursuers and pursued.  The camera work was magnificent.  Some of the long shots are particularly fascinating in displaying New York City and Washington D.C. as large cities in the midst of winter amid the ongoing tension of Redford's tense battle to survive.Two prominent character actors render solid performances; John Houseman as a veteran CIA officer and colleague of Robertson's and Max Von Sydow as a contract assassin who performs his tasks with consummate professional detachment.",5,More Timely Than When it Was Made,1171324800,"02 13, 2007",2007,4241,"['spy', 'adventure', 'film', 'Three', 'Days', 'Condor', 'was', 'released', '1975', 'was', 'period', 'when', 'American', 'government', 'commercial', 'sector', 'were', 'panic', 'access', 'oil', 'was', 'when', 'President', 'Gerald', 'Ford', 'mindful', 'power', 'Oil', 'Producing', 'Export', 'Countries', 'announced', 'future', 'might', 'actually', 'consider', 'taking', 'oil', 'force', 'should', 'be', 'denied', 'America.On', 'subject', 'Ford', 'know', 'followed', 'Nixon', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'year', 'Condor', 'was', 'released', 'Ford', 'predecessor', 'resigned', 'disgrace', 'What', 'did', 'Watergate', 'Scandal', 'What', 'was', 'series', 'clandestine', 'activities', 'once', 'again', 'lead', 'back', 'central', 'point', 'was', 'timely', 'film.Why', 'Three', 'Days', 'Condor', 'even', 'more', 'timely', 'today', 'have', 'been', 'what', 'know', 'CIA', 'clandestine', 'activities', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'then', 'have', 'experienced', '9/11', 'skepticism', 'increases', 'causes', 'who', 'put', 'plan', 'effect', 'much', 'same', 'questions', 'being', 'asked', 'assassination', 'President', 'Kennedy.The', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'even', 'timelier', 'today', 'can', 'be', 'better', 'understood', 'context', 'better', 'three', 'decades', 'initial', 'release', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'informed', 'major', 'point', 'discovered', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'book', 'reader', 'CIA', 'who', 'code', 'name', 'Condor', 'official', 'CIA', 'CIA', 'Often', 'latter', 'will', 'superimpose', 'former', 'John', 'Le', 'Carre', 'made', 'same', 'point', 'relative', 'MI5', 'British', 'intelligence.Redford', 'working', 'New', 'York', 'office', 'purporting', 'be', 'historical', 'society', 'one', 'afternoon', 'order', 'bring', 'back', 'lunch', 'rest', 'crew', 'little', 'chitchat', 'restaurant', 'discover', 'everyone', 'office', 'been', 'fatally', 'shot.Just', 'where', 'go', 'here', 'Redford', 'phone', 'headquarters', 'agent', 'just', 'research', 'man', 'who', 'books', 'recommendations', 'be', 'brought', 'same', 'fate', 'office', 'colleagues.A', 'smooth', 'suave', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'contact', 'operating', 'CIA', 'main', 'headquarters', 'Langley', 'Virginia', 'When', 'arranged', 'station', 'chief', 'come', 'New', 'York', 'bring', 'more', 'trouble', 'ensues', 'Redford', 'reason', 'wonder', 'allies', 'left', 'Company', 'away', 'tragedy', 'once', 'more.In', 'effort', 'secure', 'least', 'temporary', 'safety', 'Redford', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'store', 'where', 'gone', 'temporarily', 'hide', 'pursuers', 'professional', 'photographer', 'who', 'Brooklyn', 'Dunaway', 'first', 'resists', 'Redford', 'ultimately', 'ally', 'when', 'telling', 'truth', 'life', 'danger.At', 'one', 'point', 'Dunaway', 'Redford', 'afraid', 'get', 'know', 'not', 'going', 'live', 'very', 'long', 'telling', 'sense', 'danger', 'driving', 'interest', 'force', 'Ultimately', 'became', 'romantically', 'involved', 'willing', 'accompany', 'Langley', 'can', 'confront', 'Robertson.The', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'not', 'long', 'Daniel', 'Ellsberg', 'became', 'famous', 'leaking', 'what', 'came', 'be', 'known', 'Pentagon', 'Papers', 'fascinating', 'twist', 'end', 'film', 'Redford', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'type', 'insurance', 'policy.Some', 'film', 'most', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'involve', 'Redford', 'Robertson', 'former', 'speaking', 'best', 'America', 'case', 'decency', 'accountability', 'government', 'latter', 'proposition', 'secrecy', 'end', 'means', 'mentality.Sydney', 'Pollack', 'director', 'role', 'pacing', 'fast', 'befitting', 'spy', 'mystery', 'involving', 'pursuers', 'pursued', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'magnificent', 'long', 'shots', 'are', 'particularly', 'fascinating', 'displaying', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'large', 'cities', 'midst', 'winter', 'ongoing', 'tension', 'Redford', 'tense', 'battle', 'survive.Two', 'prominent', 'character', 'actors', 'render', 'solid', 'performances', 'John', 'Houseman', 'veteran', 'CIA', 'officer', 'colleague', 'Robertson', 'Max', 'Von', 'Sydow', 'contract', 'assassin', 'who', 'tasks', 'consummate', 'professional', 'detachment']",Three Days of the Condor VHS

I have to say that I was quite impressed by it - the nostalgia of the 70s (ok, so I was a kid then, but it was fun watching the rather archaic methods of research, i.e. no Google, the big old computers, and good old book-based fact-finding!); excellent casting, i.e. Robert Redford as a CIA reader/researcher, Faye Dunaway as Kathy the spunky captive turned love interest; Max Von Sydow as the cool and ruthless assassin Joubert; John Houseman as a high-ranking CIA officer with an agenda of his own.The movie succeeds as a thriller as it maintains a high and credible level of suspense throughout. The various plot threads weave together almost seamlessly, enhanced by the great acting by the various actors. Redford is quite believable as the preppy researcher turned man on the run though I found his talent for handling weapons and dodging experienced assassins a bit hard to swallow given his earlier claims of not having any field experience. Dunaway shares credible on-screen chemistry with Redford and I really liked that her character showed such spunk. Sydow is excellent as the assassin and he delivers a predictably compelling performance.It's amazing that almost four decades have passed and yet some of the themes touched on in this movie are still relevant today - conspiracies, deception, the role of oil (ye gads!).
