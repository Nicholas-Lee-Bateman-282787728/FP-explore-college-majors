In an odd way, the film is an antithesis to The Bicycle Thief. Dave is happy and easy going while Antonio is sad and stressed out. One pretends to be an Italian and rides the bike for fun while the other is an Italian and needs the bike for his sustenance. One has a good ending while the other is quite sad. Meanwhile, the group feel among Dennis Quaid, Jackie Earle Haley, Daniel Stern, and Dennis Christopher is probably almost the best thing Breaking Away has going for it. Unfortunately, the film suffers from a continuity problem, interrupting its momentum. It is noticeable when everybody is in his routine, and then all of a sudden, things change. Dave stops being the fake Italian, and the group starts to go away. In short, Breaking Away is really a tale of two halves. That&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t go any higher than an &#8216;8&#8217;.

It's listed on the NY Times ""1000 Best Movies of All Time,"" published in 2004, has always had good word of mouth, and other Amazon users obviously think highly of it as well.  Personally I don't get it.OK, it's not a clunker.  The four friends who are the heart of this film, local kids in a college town who are looked down on by the college students as being inferior, are definitely well-drawn characters.  By the end of the movie we know them as if they were kids who have lived down the street from us for years.  That's a rare enough thing that it warrants a 3-star rating in itself.However, the result of a climactic bike race (and everything that happens during the race) is totally obvious from the start.  Furthermore, the baddest ""villain"" college guy in the film is about as intimidating as a cold bowl of soup, and about as interesting, which completely destroys any attempt at dramatic tension between the two sides.The phony Italian accent and ""exchange student"" act put on by the main character is unconvincing in the extreme; any college girl who'd fall for that would be a complete idiot, but Robyn Douglass's character is never represented as anything but sympathetic, certainly not an idiot; this just does not work.  And I'm amazed to see that Paul Dooley, who plays the phony exchange student's father, got such praise for his work in this role; to me his acting is on the level of a skit on SNL.Beyond those problems, the only other positive I can think of is that the film maintains an authentic feel by filming on location and, by working within a small budget, so it isn't overproduced and overdirected like a ""bigger"" project would've been.The comparison to ""Rocky"" is obvious, and with this film having come out about three years after that Stallone breakthrough, I have to think its reputation comes from critics and moviegoers of that era longing for a similar film.  So many truly dreadful copycats came out in that time that this, by comparison, must have seemed golden at the time.  But it simply doesn't hold up a quarter-century later.  Maybe part of my problem here is that this kind of underdog sports has been done to death by now, but this won an Oscar for best screenplay and was nominated for others?

Trying to foreshadow what would be picked ""Breaking Away"" came to mind.  Surprisingly but not much so the film came in eighth.  Not having seen the movie since a network TV showing in the early eighties I was compelled to revisit the film.  It's as good as ever.  What accounts for the film's durability?  For starters, director Peter Yates and Oscar-winning screenwriter Steve Tesich fully flesh out the movies central premise of Middle-America townies and their uneasy relationship with the visiting University kids.  All of the ""Cutter"" kids(Dennis Christopher, Dennis Quaid, Daniel Stern, and Jackie Earle Haley) are complex and endearing characters and at the time most of the actors were virtual unknowns so you can accept them as lifelong friends.  Christopher's parents played by Barbara Barrie(Oscar-nominated) and Paul Dooley(criminally not nominated) are also recognizable as human beings and not caricatures.  Then of course there's the cycling sequences which are nothing less than thrilling.  If you haven't heard of ""Breaking Away"" I would behoove you to check it out.  On a note of trivia, In 1980 there was a shortlived TV spin-off of the movie with Shaun Cassidy playing the Christopher role and Dooley and Barrie reprising their parts.  The critical reception was pretty good but ABC gave it a killer time slot and the show was quickly cancelled.  Also, cult fave P.J.

It's not a world-changer and the ending is a bit predictable, but it is a wonderful and charming coming of age story and an honest look at small-town America. And cycling and Italians play central roles -- a plus for an American cyclist living in Italy, like me.But having an affinity for things Italian or for bike racing is not necessary in order to enjoy this 25-year-old classic. What is necessary is an appreciation for small things and memories about the mysterious period between adolescence and adulthood. If that describes you, then chances are you'll enjoy this touching film.Amid the praise I should say that the DVD package is only average: the original trailer and teaser are there, but it would have been nice to have some commentary from director Peter Yates, some of the actors, or from critics who were fans of the film.

I first saw it when it was on TV, and at the age of 7 or 8, I watched it with my dad.  It has only gotten better over time.  At first glance, it may seem like one of those cliche, underclass overcoming the odds and beating the priviliged movies, but it is so much more.This movie has so many levels to it, I don't know where to begin.  I tend to focus on the cycling aspect, because it gives me hope that one day I will be able to do something cycling related.  Whenever I lose my motivation to go out for a ride, I just have to think of Dave and his love of cycling and I'm ready to go again.It's not just a sports movie at all, though.  The interaction between characters.  Kids and parents not understanding eachother, but still caring, relationships between friends, and not wanting to fulfill certain expectations:  they all have a place in this movie.  I can honestly say that this movie gets to me like no other movie can.  Anyone who doesn't feel anything during the race at the end must have a cold, cold heart.The story is great.  Four town kids, who feel like they are living in the shadows of the jocks attending the University in their town, who call them cutters because their parents worked for the quary, cutting stone, get by and eventually win their dignity.  One's a dreamer, searching for love and riding his bike.  The other is the brother of a cop, who can't stand living in that shadow.  Of course there's the joker.  And the little guy, who gets in over his head, but will never give up.  This may sound like a trite description, but each character has something that everyone will relate to, and that makes each character so alive.I cannot recommend this movie enough.  If you liked Chariots of Fire, Stand by Me, or any other movies like that, I feel confident that you will like this.

225498,A2YDTAOREY8X0,6300247120,ferretk4,"[5, 5]","""Breaking Away"" is a movie with an unusually wide scope of topics.  Its plot is not confined to one theme (a seemingly-doomed romance or good versus evil, for example) but instead almost seems to tackle life itself; or at least, life as it is for bike-riding, Italy-emulating Dave and his three close friends.Each of the four pals gets his fair share of attention, and almost without noticing the viewer comes to know&#65533;and like, for all their quirks&#65533;them all.  They are united by an obvious life-long friendship, and (although they would never admit it) a thinly-veiled desire to somehow make their way into college, or at least get a job.All except for Dave, who has multiple additional goals jockying for position in the forefront of his mind: to become a champion bike-racer, earn his father's respect (or at least un-earn his father's shame) and even win the heart of a certain college girl.Unfortunately for him, he's going to learn a bit about reality along the way.Every character in this film, no matter how minor, is fully developed and multi-faceted.  Enjoyably poignant moments, realistic hilarity and quite a few exhilirating competitions make this film both amusing and wonderfully human.

225499,A2VE83MZF98ITY,6300247120,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[22, 26]","I have a particular affinity for this film, as it is set in the town where I currently live, Bloomington, Indiana.  Most people in Bloomington are basketball crazy; apart from this, perhaps the second most popular sport is bicycling, culminating at the end of the school year with the Little 500 bicycle race on campus (a bicycle version of the internationally-known Indianapolis 500 motor race, just 50 miles north).  This is primary a campus event, with fraternities and a few other organisations fielding teams; there are also community teams, and always at least one team with the name 'cutter'.The film is a piece of fiction not just in its plot but also in the details, but it is a good story.  The primary character is Dave Stoller (played by Dennis Christoper), a recent high school graduate who isn't sure what to do with the rest of his life.  He and his three friends Mike (a very young Dennis Quaid), Cyril (Daniel Stern) and Moocher (Jackie Earle Haley) had made a high school pact to 'waste their lives together' hanging out in the comfortable, small-town atmosphere of Bloomington.  However, half the town is university, with all the ambitious, young people that such institutions bring.  Dave is son of Raymond (Paul Dooley) and Evelyn (Barbara Barrie), a typical middle class working couple.  Raymond makes his living as a used-car salesman, largely taking advantage of the supposedly-smarter college kids.  Barbara is trying to put some romance back into their lives.In his boredom, Dave becomes obsessed with two things - Italian culture and bicycle racing.  He calls his father and mother 'papa' and 'mama', plays Italian opera (Caruso, etc.) endlessly, persuades his mother to add Italian cuisine to the home cooking; Dave's friends put up with him, as they have their own small struggles to deal with - Mike, in entering a stage in life where he's no longer the star quarterback of the school; Cyril, who can only think of the next way to disappoint his father (who delights in being understanding); and Moocher, unemployed and unambitious, but falling in love and planning to get married.  The spend their time in a sort of dazed and confused state, without too much confusion due to lack of stimulation.Dave realises there is more to life than hanging out on the downtown square in Bloomington.  He begins impersonating an Italian exchange student, falls for a co-ed named Katherine (played by Robyn Douglass), and the juxtaposition of town and gown is set - Katherine is the girlfriend of a swim-team member, and Dave with his three friends have a confrontation with them on campus that leads the president of the university to step in, marking as the field of combat the hallowed bicycle race, the Little 500.Dave, in his drive to be the Italian exchange student, has taken to idolising the soon-to-be-visiting Italian bicycle team of Cinzano, and become a great cyclist himself.  Disappointed by the poor sportsmanship of that race, Dave is ready to give up racing, until his father Raymond, who had always been against his son's starry-eyed ambitions, sees the spark go out of Dave's life, and encourages him to join his friends in the newly-formed Cutter team, and run the race at the college.The word 'cutter' is a derogatory term the college kids used to describe the townsfolk.  Bloomington is situated in the midst of a huge natural deposit of limestone, some of which has been used in construction of buildings all over the world, including bridges in London, the Empire State Building, and massive public works projects in Asia.  The college kids (the 'gown') look down on the cutters (the 'town'), and are intent on not letting them steal the victory in the race.  The epic battle is set.There were cameos in the film, including the then -actual president of the university, John Ryan.  Extras for town and college scenes were hired from Bloomington, a few of whom I know and enjoy seeing again in their 25-year-old glory (one such person, Jennifer Mikel, sang at the wedding of a friend not too long ago).  Those of us who know the geography of Bloomington watch the film and delight in editing that causes geographic problems - turning the corner on a bicycle and going down a street that is not connected to the one before; riding or driving down streets the wrong way on one-way streets.  Most especially, we delight in seeing the town and university as it was.  Much has changed in the 25 years since this film was made, and yet, much is the same.The term 'cutter' didn't really come into use until this film - it was more or less invented for the story in this film.  As Dave's father Raymond tells Dave at one point, Dave is not a cutter.  Raymond was a cutter - he cut limetone in the quarries, but those days are gone.  The campus is built of limestone, and it is time now for Dave take advantage of those buildings.In the end, the hero does not get the girl, but does get a life, in a victory that goes beyond what any race could bring.  (Dave wins one bicycle race in the film, and loses another; you'll have to see it for yourself to find out how this plays out).The film stands the test of time fairly well - the comedy and the drama still rings true.",4,Still good after 25 years...,1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,5200,"['have', 'particular', 'affinity', 'film', 'set', 'town', 'where', 'currently', 'live', 'Bloomington', 'Indiana',

It was an excellent movie, but I particularly liked it because it paralleled a lot of my youth experience. I grew up in a town having a major university. I went to Junior and Senior High School in Boulder, Colorado, and the University of Colorado was only a couple blocks from the High School. Such towns are simply over-run with young people and the youngsters split into two well-defined groups that have little to do with one another: those that are attending college and those who are not. There's a bit of a status problem here with the latter group clearly being on the bottom, and it shows. I managed to somewhat bridge the gap in that I was from Boulder and living at home, but I was also going to CU. I quickly found that revealing my Boulder roots was not cool. The university young people considered Boulder people as the local yokals. In any case, this movie depicts the division of young people and their differences very well, although the University is Indiana and the town is Bloomington. It's very well done and the director had a keen eye. About the only flaw I saw in the depiction it was the parents of one boy (Dennis Christopher) were depicted in an overly corny way, especially the father (Paul Dooley). Otherwise, the acting on the part of all the young people, both university and not, was exceptionally good. Oh, and by the way, the movie has a very enjoyable musical background.It's a simple, somewhat painful, story of growing up and finding your place in the world. Christopher plays a talented if somewhat eccentric bicycle racer who ultimately enters a university-sponsored relay bike race and wins finishing in front of all university people. It's exciting and fun to watch. The whole movie is very well put together and enjoyable. Everything about it (with the minor exception of the parents) is first rate.Gary Peterson",5,Excellent Movie.

225504,A1LW3XGXYP98BW,6300247120,H. Pace,"[1, 1]","Breaking Away is one of the most underappreciated sports movies ever made.  I have it my top five all-time sports movies (along with fellow underappreciated niche sports flick, Vision Quest).  More than just a sports movie, it is also a great coming of age story and teen comedy.Breaking Away follows the growing pains of four blue collar boys (including a young Dennis Quaid and Daniel Stern) from a college town (Bloomington, Indiana) trying to adjust to life after high school with no bright prospects on the horizon.  Dave, a cyclist obsessed with an Italian team, is the heart of the quartet.  A love interest, a rival, and Dave's parents (including Paul Dooley in an even more hilarious turn as the father than in Sixteen Candles) also factor in.Given the bias toward the homogenization of movie settings driven by a southern California based movie industry, it is refreshing to see a movie that is so much about a particular place.  And Breaking Away is very much about Bloomington, Indiana.  The climax occurs during the Little 500, Indiana University's idiosyncratic bicycle race.  The townies swim in an abandoned quarry and are derisively called ""cutters"" by the college kids, alluding to the Indiana limestone industry.This movie tries to do many things, and it does them all extremely well.  You will laugh at Dooley and cheer during the climactic race.  But it's the coming of age stuff that really shines.  There's a lot of bitterness and pain and growth amongst the laughter and cheers.  I wouldn't just recommend this to cycling fans or just to sports fans but to anyone who wants to see a great movie that has heart and soul.The DVD extras include the theatrical trailer, trailers for a handful of Fox movies (Baby's Day Out, My Bodyguard, Rookie of the Year, and The Sandlot), and two TV spots for Breaking Away.",5,One of the Most Underappreciated Sports Movies Ever Made,1319068800,"10 20, 2011",2011,1831,"['Breaking', 'Away', 'one', 'most', 'underappreciated', 'sports', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'have', 'top', 'five', 'all-time', 'sports', 'movies', 'fellow', 'underappreciated', 'niche', 'sports', 'flick', 'Vision', 'Quest', 'More', 'just', 'sports', 'movie', 'also', 'great', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'teen', 'comedy.Breaking', 'Away', 'growing', 'pains', 'four', 'blue', 'collar', 'boys', 'including', 'young', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'college', 'town', 'Bloomington', 'Indiana', 'trying', 'adjust', 'life', 'high', 'school', 'bright', 'prospects', 'horizon', 'Dave', 'cyclist', 'obsessed', 'Italian', 'team', 'heart', 'quartet', 'love', 'interest', 'rival', 'Dave', 'parents', 'including', 'Paul', 'Dooley', 'even', 'more', 'hilarious', 'turn', 'father', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'also', 'factor', 'bias', 'homogenization', 'movie', 'settings', 'driven', 'southern', 'California', 'based', 'movie', 'industry', 'refreshing', 'see', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'particular', 'place', 'Breaking', 'Away', 'very', 'much', 'Bloomington', 'Indiana', 'climax', 'Little', '500', 'Indiana', 'University', 'idiosyncratic', 'bicycle', 'race', 'townies', 'swim', 'abandoned', 'quarry', 'are', 'derisively', 'called', 'cutters', 'college', 'kids', 'alluding', 'Indiana', 'limestone', 'industry.This', 'movie', 'tries', 'do', 'many', 'things', 'extremely', 'well', 'will', 'laugh', 'Dooley', 'cheer', 'climactic', 'race', 'coming', 'age', 'stuff', 'really', 'lot', 'bitterness', 'pain', 'growth', 'amongst', 'laughter', 'cheers', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'recommend', 'cycling', 'fans', 'just', 'sports', 'fans', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'great', 'movie', 'heart', 'soul.The', 'DVD', 'include', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'trailers', 'handful', 'Fox', 'movies', 'Baby', 'Day', 'Out', 'My', 'Bodyguard', 'Rookie', 'Year', 'Sandlot', 'two', 'TV', 'spots', 'Breaking', 'Away']",N/A

The film is about four friends who have graduated high school and aren't quite sure whether to embrace adulthood and the future or to shun it and cling instead to their childhood identities and each other.  There is a great deal of warmth and gentle humor throughout the film, and the performances are winning.Mike (Dennis Quaid), the leader of the group, clings to his friends as reminders of his days as high school quarterback and fears they will prove to be his best.  Moocher is eager for adulthood and is planning to marry his girlfriend.  The only problem is he cannot keep a job!  Cyril (Daniel Stern) is resigned to the fact he may never leave Bloomington, but remains buoyant regardless.  Dave Stohler is the main character, he knows exactly what he wants to be, an Italian Cyclist.  There is only one problem- he isn't Italian!  Dave learns through a young woman he meets and eventually through his father that simply being Dave is more than good enough, and that he must embrace his natural talents and the future.  There have been countless ""coming of age"" pictures, but this one is the most enjoyable!DVD: The production values of the DVD leave something to be desired and therefore I only give the product 4 stars.

The cultural war between the college students and the &#34;cutters&#34; is a familiar story of us vs. them and it is presented in an emotionally honest format.Paul Dooley as the anachronistic father is hilarious and Barbara Barrie as the cooly constant mother play their supporting roles very well to Dennis Christopher's star turn as the physically gifted bike racer who is obsessed with Italian racing stars.  It is interesting to see how well he is accepted by his friends (Quaid, Haley and Stern) who have no understanding of his love of bikes, but are bound to him with their common childhood friendship.  All of the characters could have come off as flat, two-dimensional caricatures, but everyone presents their parts as fully developed characters.I watched this movie with my three oldest boys and the movie showed them good values, morals and still allowed them to laugh at some silly behavior.

It puts a new light on the tradition set by such movies as Shane, and To Kill a Mockingbird. It is certainly sweeter than either of them, but in its own way, poignant, touching, and easier to identify with for the post-war generation.  OK - the matters at hand are trivial in the long run, but they are no less real or familiar to those who grew up as baby-boomers and later.Dave Stoller dreams big - though the dreams are so far out of place for a kid from the midwest, that they seem like sheer fantasy.  The film shows that these dreams, and the passion that drives them, are what are to be sought.  Cyril, Mike, and Moocher seem rudderless by comparison, and by the film's climax, it is clear that even fantasy masquerading as dreams are preferred to none at all.The characters are enough to make you watch this film again and again, Paul Dooley's long-suffering but ultimately sincere, loving father, Barbara Barrie's mother comes off as flaky at first, but proves to be the most sensible of the bunch when all is done.Of course the characters here set Daniel Stern and Dennis Quaid on the paths of stardom - this film is still their 2nd or 3rd highest rated performances.My biases as a cyclist do show up with this film - in the truck racing sequence and in the Little 500, my legs start pumping involuntarily - and I usually end up heading out for a good ten or twenty miles.

with his friends' help - he gains her affection.Meanwhile, the annual bike race on the campus known as the ""Little 500"" is about to take place, and Dennis wants to enter the race, even though he is not a student.The movie was filmed on location, and watching it, I was immediately quite familiar with each location, having lived in Bloomington and attended college and lived there for over four years.It really is a beautiful campus, so this really provides some charm for the visuals.There are lots of very funny moments here, especially his encounter with the young woman's boyfriend and his friend's on the spot decision to quit his job with his insulting boss.There are also some surprisingly touching moments, especially the one in which his father takes him to one of the very few operating limestone quarries in the area.Dennis's father (played by Paul Dooley) is clearly wistful for the days when he was once a proud artisan instead of a car salesman.An interesting thing about this movie is that I don't recall seeing the actor who plays the main character of Dennis in any other movies since, while I have seen Dooley in a few, and two of the friends played by Daniel Stern and Dennis Quaid have a very long list of movies to their credit.This movie always warms my heart with its take on life.Corny?YesFunny?Very!You'll really enjoy this one.Check it out.",4,A movie actually filmed close to my own home,1292803200,"12 20, 2010",2010,2479,"['story', 'kid', 'named', 'Dennis', 'Stohler', 'Bloomington', 'Indiana', 'who', 'ambitions', 'be', 'Italian', 'college', 'student', 'bicyclist.The', 'trouble', 'Bloomington', 'home', 'Indiana', 'University', 'Bob', 'Knight', 'anyone', 'Stohler', 'Italian', 'college', 'student.Instead', 'cutter', 'local', 'term', 'used', 'derisively', 'describe', 'blue', 'collar', 'non', 'college', 'student', 'people', 'town', 'term', 'originating', 'large', 'numbers', 'people', 'area', 'who', 'once', 'worked', 'limestone', 'supplied', 'stone', 'used', 'most', 'buildings', 'campus', 'even', 'Pentagon', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building', 'Lincoln', 'Memorial', 'Washington', 'Monument.Sadly', 'most', 'quarries', 'are', 'now', 'closed', 'many', 'craftsmen', 'who', 'once', 'worked', 'quarries', 'have', 'resort', 'less', 'prestigious', 'jobs', 'Dennis', 'father', 'one', 'such', 'man', 'owning', 'used', 'car', 'lot.Dennis', 'Italian', 'accent', 'few', 'words', 'language', 'riding', 'around', 'campus', 'ten', 'speed', 'pose', 'someone', 'not', 'even', 'carrying', 'way', 'home.This', 'eventually', 'attention', 'beautiful', 'coed', 'friends', 'help', 'gains', 'affection.Meanwhile', 'annual', 'bike', 'race', 'campus', 'known', 'Little', '500', 'take', 'place', 'Dennis', 'enter', 'race', 'even', 'not', 'student.The', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'watching', 'was', 'immediately', 'quite', 'familiar', 'location', 'having', 'lived', 'Bloomington', 'attended', 'college', 'lived', 'four', 'years.It', 'really', 'beautiful', 'campus', 'really', 'charm', 'visuals.There', 'are', 'lots', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'here', 'especially', 'encounter', 'young', 'woman', 'boyfriend', 'friend', 'spot', 'decision', 'quit', 'job', 'insulting', 'are', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'touching', 'moments', 'especially', 'one', 'father', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'operating', 'limestone', 'quarries', 'area.Dennis', 'father', 'played', 'Paul', 'Dooley', 'clearly', 'wistful', 'days', 'when', 'was', 'once', 'proud', 'artisan', 'instead', 'car', 'salesman.An', 'interesting', 'thing', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'seeing', 'actor', 'who', 'main', 'character', 'Dennis', 'other', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'Dooley', 'few', 'two', 'friends', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'have', 'very', 'long', 'list', 'movies', 'credit.This', 'movie', 'always', 'warms', 'heart', 'take', 'life.Corny', 'YesFunny', 'Very', ""'ll"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'one.Check', 'out']",N/A

This is arguably the greatest movie to ever be forgotten by mainstream audiences but undeniably still one of the best movies ever made. Breaking Away is, like its characters, archetypal, unpretentious, appealing and consistently likeable. The story of a group of four teenage ""townies"" in Bloomington, Indiana is the Diner of cycling movies. Dennis Christopher, Dennis Quaid, Daniel Stern and Jackie Earl Haley are brilliant as the four buddies caught up in the angst of leaving their Wonder Years behind in a town dominated by the privileged, out-of-town students attending Indiana University. With the local factories looming as an ineluctable destiny, the four dare to reach beyond assumptions and expectations and discover a self worth unrelated to class and opportunity. In the process, they discover the dignity and honor that is their legacy as the next generation of honest, admirable and hardworking families. Dennis Christopher is superb in the lead as the opera-loving, Italian worshipping son with a passion for cycling. His coming-of-age under the watchful eye of a concerned dad (the excellent Paul Dooley - who effectively recreated the same character later as Molly Ringwald's father in 16 Candles) is one of the most convincing film depictions of a parent-child relationship free of contrived crises and anxieties. The final crowd-pleasing 20 minutes will have you cheering loudly in your living room. In disappointment and in triumph, Breaking Away speaks to audiences across the world in the language of universal principles such as loyalty, hard work, sportsmanship and honor.

Break Away is the inspiring story based on actual events chronicling the story of a hard working husband that loses his job and is forced to use what he has and let God multiply it. It takes place in South Africa and accounts Francois' challenge of providing for his family after losing his job. He is forced to use what he has, including an old bicycle. With the help of his ""black sheep"" brother, a bicycle shop owner and pro-cyclist, Francois makes some life-changing discoveries about his life, career, and faith in God.This is a powerful look at what so many are experiencing all over the world in these economic hard times. What would you do, if no matter where you looked for a job, they all seemed to come up empty handed. Not only that by the collection calls continue for your credit cards and mortgage, but with no money in sight, you have to make the best of what you have. I think what really touches the heart of the viewer the most, is that this isn't a quick fix, and that Francois and his family really struggle with the same issues we all do. How can we have faith in God when it seems like our prayers are going unanswered at times. How as the man, the main financial provider, in his family, he feels like this is a personal burden and ultimately his responsibility to provide for them. The solution isn't an easy one and you find yourself rooting for Francois the entire time. His ability to create something from nothing is mind-blowing and really pushes us to think outside the box in answers to our own problems.I received Break Away from Word Films compliments of Blogger Gateway for my honest review and received no monetary compensation for a favorable one. Because this movie was filmed in South Africa, at times, the accents can be a bit difficult to understand. However, that does not take away from the impact of the story. This DVD runs 113 minutes and really encourages us to have faith when it seems like the odds are truly against us.

Breaking Away is a window into a world of class war, privilege, and teen angst. It is set in Bloomington, Indiana on the campus of Indiana University. The spoiled rotten college kids look down their noses at the townies. They call them &#34;cutters&#34; which comes from the once popular job of working in a stone quarry cutting limestone for use in buildings. Dennis Quad's character (Mike) takes offense at the Preppy college kids coming to their swimming hole. He fights with several of the jocks after they beat up one of the main characters (Cyril) played by Daniel Stern. As a result, the University of Indy decided to allow the &#34;cutters&#34; to enter a team into the &#34;little 500&#34; bicycle race. The other main Character, Dave Stoller, played by Dennis Christopher, is obsessed with racing road bicycles. He is so obsessed, he talks and acts as if he is Italian (very funny!). He is very fast on his bike and races against a tractor trailer. Team Cinzano comes to Indy for a race, and Dave thinks he can impress them with his riding skill. He soon learns differently and his spirits are broken. Ultimately, they race (as the &#34;Cutters&#34;) in the little 500.

Most of the townspeople (called ""cutters"" by the college students who look down upon them) work or worked in the nearby rock quarry, managing at most a modest middle-class status.  This story is primarily about this friction between social classes, and one young man's successful ascent out of his own social class and into college.  And it is about more than that.  The method by which he succeeds inspires the whole town to be proud of their solid, working class roots, and affirms the fact that in America we need not be bound by our social class, and indeed with brains, ability, talent, and yes, guts, a person can achieve anything.The protagonist is an amateur bicyclist, and the struggle is initially about his attempt to break into the ranks of amateur bicycling.  This theme is woven into the social class divisions of the town, which are an obstacle to his dreams.  In the end, (no spoiler here) he succeeds in a dramatic way.

Though the films offers some great scenes of bikes racing through the lovely Southern Indiana countryside as well as footage from IU's fabled Little 500, important coming of age themes are also addressed in a humorous and not unrealistic way.The movie centers on four young ""townies"" Mooch, Mike, Cyril and Dave who are one year out of high school but still aimlessly hanging out around town and filled with jealousy of the more privileged IU students who derisively refer to them as cutters.
