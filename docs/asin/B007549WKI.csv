As the great man himself says, &#34; 'Nuff said.&#34;",5,A must for Marvel fans,1402185600,"06 8, 2014",2014,189,"['When', 'anime', 'Madhouse', 'right', 'formula', 'Iron', 'Man', 'perfectly', 'anime', 'style', 'visuals', 'storytelling', 'great', 'man', '34', ""'Nuff"", 'said.', '34']",Iron Man Marvel Animated Series

Make of that what you will, but obviously I am going to show some favoritism to Iron Man products.  Let's just be honest here.Now that that's out of the way, lets settle something.  People seem to either love or hate anime.  I love anime and have been watching it for a very long time.  If you love Iron Man, but hate anime, don't even bother watching this.A lot of people on various websites have trashed these Marvel anime just because they are anime.  If anime isn't for you, then these aren't either.If you do like anime, then you already know that anime is slick and visually stylized.  I has a certain feel or Japanese quirkiness to it, that will be lacking elsewhere.  This anime has that, but brings the fun of centering on a popular super hero that I know and love.  The artwork is nice, crisp and colorful.  It's very pretty to behold.  Of course like a lot of animation in this cost cutting age we live in, there aren't 30 or 60 frames of animation.  Now that things are done on computer instead of hand drawn, companies tend to skip as many frames as possible and often show many static scenes to cut time and expenses in production.  That's just something you have to deal with now.  Anime purists are aware that old school hand drawn anime had a much more fluid sense of motion to it and a lot less of the shortcut method.None of that has proved to be a bother in the Iron Man anime.  That is partly due to the fact that the episodes are fairly fast paced.  Iron Man is facing dangers very soon.  This is only a 12 episode show and that could be looked at as a good thing.  A lot of anime will do a 26 episode season or series.  Some good much longer and some go way too long.  At least here, you know you're going to get the entire series with one purchase and the show has to come to an end.So without spoiling anything, I just feel that this is a fun, beautiful, fast paced anime style tribute to a great superhero.  I think studio Madhouse did a great job.  These not a high level of utter silliness that can be found in some anime.  You won't find singing pigs or magical cat girls, so don't worry about that.At this price, this is totally worth buying if you are a fan of both anime and Iron Man.For me, the enjoyment of this series has been even more pleasurable because me and about 30 of my friends will be getting together to watch all of the Marvel super hero movies and then going to see The Avengers in the theater the next day.  The Iron Man anime is a fun appetizer.  The rest is dessert.",4,A fun and colorful appetizer before the main course.,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,2594,"['should', 'know', 'Iron', 'Man', 'second', 'favorite', 'super', 'hero', 'time', 'Make', 'what', 'will', 'obviously', 'am', 'going', 'show', 'favoritism', 'Iron', 'Man', 'products', 'Let', 'just', 'be', 'honest', 'here.Now', 'way', 'settle', 'something', 'People', 'seem', 'love', 'hate', 'anime', 'love', 'anime', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'love', 'Iron', 'Man', 'hate', 'anime', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'watching', 'this.A', 'lot', 'people', 'various', 'websites', 'have', 'trashed', 'Marvel', 'anime', 'just', 'are', 'anime', 'anime', ""n't"", 'then', 'are', ""n't"", 'either.If', 'do', 'anime', 'then', 'already', 'know', 'anime', 'slick', 'visually', 'stylized', 'certain', 'feel', 'Japanese', 'quirkiness', 'will', 'be', 'lacking', 'elsewhere', 'anime', 'fun', 'centering', 'popular', 'super', 'hero', 'know', 'love', 'artwork', 'nice', 'crisp', 'colorful', 'very', 'pretty', 'behold', 'course', 'lot', 'animation', 'cost', 'cutting', 'age', 'live', 'are', ""n't"", '30', '60', 'frames', 'animation', 'Now', 'things', 'are', 'done', 'computer', 'instead', 'hand', 'drawn', 'companies', 'tend', 'skip', 'many', 'frames', 'possible', 'often', 'show', 'many', 'static', 'scenes', 'cut', 'time', 'expenses', 'production', 'just', 'something', 'have', 'deal', 'now', 'Anime', 'purists', 'are', 'aware', 'old', 'school', 'hand', 'drawn', 'anime', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'fluid', 'sense', 'motion', 'lot', 'less', 'shortcut', 'method.None', 'proved', 'be', 'bother', 'Iron', 'Man', 'anime', 'partly', 'due', 'fact', 'episodes', 'are', 'fairly', 'fast', 'paced', 'Iron', 'Man', 'facing', 'dangers', 'very', 'soon', 'only', '12', 'episode', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'looked', 'good', 'thing', 'lot', 'anime', 'will', 'do', '26', 'episode', 'season', 'series', 'good', 'much', 'longer', 'go', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'least', 'here', 'know', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'entire', 'series', 'one', 'purchase', 'show', 'come', 'end.So', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'just', 'feel', 'fun', 'beautiful', 'fast', 'paced', 'anime', 'style', 'tribute', 'great', 'superhero', 'think', 'studio', 'Madhouse', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'not', 'high', 'level', 'utter', 'silliness', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'anime', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'singing', 'pigs', 'magical', 'cat', 'girls', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'about', 'that.At', 'price', 'totally', 'worth', 'buying', 'are', 'fan', 'anime', 'Iron', 'Man.For', 'enjoyment', 'series', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'pleasurable', '30', 'friends', 'will', 'be', 'getting', 'together', 'watch', 'Marvel', 'super', 'hero', 'movies', 'then', 'going', 'see', 'Avengers', 'theater', 'next', 'day', 'Iron', 'Man', 'anime', 'fun', 'appetizer', 'rest', 'dessert']",Iron Man Marvel Animated Series
