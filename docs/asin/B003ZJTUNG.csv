1377551,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B003ZJTUNG,Brent Butler,"[5, 5]","For most of us, the only exposure we've had to Oklahoma! has been the movie, and there is no doubt that the movie doesn't slight us in any way.This London stage production is a faithful revival, and was well cast. Everyone delivers in their roles, both in dialogue and song. Do Hugh Jackman and Josefine Gabrielle match up to Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones? Not even close. Jackman is on key, but he lacks MacRae's full, rich voice. Gabrielle gives a spirited and emotional performance in both acting and singing, but she lacks that pure quality of voice that made Shirley Jones such a big star in musicals. To be fair, only a handful of women in the history of film and stage could match up to Shirley Jones.Despite that, this is a fun alternative to see a different production of the show. We enjoyed it thoroughly.I do have two quibbles with the quality of the media, and that held this product down to four stars in my book. First, the Blu ray picture quality doesn't measure up. It really is no better than a DVD quality picture. Second, the sound is often just barely out of sync. Early on I wondered if I needed to adjust my receiver, but then I noticed that sometimes the sound IS in sync. Sometimes it is out of sync at the start and middle of a sentence, and catches up to be in sync by the time the actor closes their mouth. LOL This made me wonder if they used film and audio from two different performances, or possibly picked up audio from a number of different performances to make a patchwork of best available.Regardless, if you are a fan of this musical, you really won't be disappointed to sit through this presentation of it. The orchestra is dead on, and in chorus numbers you'd be hard pressed to tell this from the movie. Aunt Eller is spot on. Ado Annie is a gorgeous girl with probably the strongest voice on the stage. Judd is menacing, and if he doesn't bring to mind Rod Steiger level menace, not many probably could. Will Parker is also convincingly played. Hugh Jackman is convincing and funny as Curly.Recommended.",4,An interesting alternative,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,2046,"['most', 'only', 'exposure', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Oklahoma', 'been', 'movie', 'doubt', 'movie', ""n't"", 'slight', 'way.This', 'London', 'stage', 'production', 'faithful', 'revival', 'was', 'well', 'cast', 'Everyone', 'delivers', 'roles', 'dialogue', 'song', 'Do', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Josefine', 'Gabrielle', 'match', 'up', 'Gordon', 'MacRae', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'Not', 'even', 'close', 'Jackman', 'key', 'MacRae', 'full', 'rich', 'voice', 'Gabrielle', 'spirited', 'emotional', 'performance', 'acting', 'singing', 'pure', 'quality', 'voice', 'made', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'big', 'star', 'musicals', 'be', 'fair', 'only', 'handful', 'women', 'history', 'film', 'stage', 'could', 'match', 'up', 'Shirley', 'Jones.Despite', 'fun', 'alternative', 'see', 'different', 'production', 'show', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughly.I', 'do', 'have', 'two', 'quibbles', 'quality', 'media', 'held', 'product', 'down', 'four', 'stars', 'book', 'First', 'Blu', 'ray', 'picture', 'quality', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'really', 'better', 'DVD', 'quality', 'picture', 'Second', 'sound', 'often', 'just', 'barely', 'sync', 'Early', 'wondered', 'needed', 'adjust', 'receiver', 'then', 'noticed', 'sound', 'IS', 'sync', 'Sometimes', 'sync', 'start', 'middle', 'sentence', 'up', 'be', 'sync', 'time', 'actor', 'mouth', 'LOL', 'made', 'wonder', 'used', 'film', 'audio', 'two', 'different', 'performances', 'possibly', 'picked', 'up', 'audio', 'number', 'different', 'performances', 'make', 'patchwork', 'best', 'available.Regardless', 'are', 'fan', 'musical', 'really', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'sit', 'presentation', 'orchestra', 'dead', 'chorus', 'numbers', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'tell', 'movie', 'Aunt', 'Eller', 'spot', 'Ado', 'Annie', 'gorgeous', 'girl', 'probably', 'strongest', 'voice', 'stage', 'Judd', 'menacing', ""n't"", 'bring', 'mind', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'level', 'menace', 'not', 'many', 'probably', 'could', 'Will', 'Parker', 'also', 'convincingly', 'played', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'convincing', 'funny', 'Curly.Recommended']",N/A

I knew it was a filmed stage play so kept that in mind when viewing it.  I thought it was marvelous.  I must admit that I am a HUGH fan of Hugh Jackman so might have been predisposed to like it, be that as it may, it is well worth watching and since I could not see it in the theater I am grateful that it was filmed so I could enjoy it.  I wish they had filmed the original Camelot Broadway production that I was fortunate to see in 1962 and have never forgotten.

What makes this more disappointing is the fact that the show was taped without an audience but they insert it later.  I guess they didn't want coughling,cell phones and other noise.  The principals are fine but the production lacks anything cinematic.  I felt the same way about KISS ME KATE. Stick with the Gordon McRaw movie.

More songs, static (though ingenious) sets, etc.  However, they give a fine ""movie like"" presentation.  Evidently they filmed it twice.  Once with the audience (from off and near stage level, you see the audience at times and hear applause) and once without (with ""in your face"" camera work and closeups)  They then interwove the two versions in a mostly seamless fashion.  My son who is preparing to audition for Curly and/or Will at his high school, thought it a much better production than the movie.  He also like the singing better, expecially the ""Annie"" character.  However, my feeling is that Hugh Jackson, though quite good, is no Gordon MacRae.
