It is one of my all time favourite films.  I was able to copy it to DVD from the video some time ago but to have an actual copy of the film is fantastic.I have always enjoy Jeff Osterhage's cowboy films (The Sacketts, The Shadow Riders) and this one is no exception.  It has so many elements to it.  Not least the way Jeff's character John is a cross between Luke Skywalker and the Lone Ranger.  He is trained to use his 'instincts' like the force and become a force for good.  Hal Holbrook is excellent as his mentor who has a secret of his own.I would recommend anyone to buy this film and just immerse yourself in how westerns used to be made.  I don't think you will be disappointed.",5,Waited Years for the Film to come out onDVD,1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,788,"['OMG', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'film', 'actually', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'have', 'looked', 'out', 'years', 'one', 'time', 'favourite', 'films', 'was', 'able', 'copy', 'DVD', 'video', 'time', 'ago', 'have', 'actual', 'copy', 'film', 'fantastic.I', 'have', 'always', 'enjoy', 'Jeff', 'Osterhage', 'cowboy', 'films', 'Sacketts', 'Shadow', 'Riders', 'one', 'exception', 'so', 'many', 'elements', 'Not', 'way', 'Jeff', 'character', 'John', 'cross', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'trained', 'use', ""'instincts"", 'force', 'become', 'force', 'good', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'excellent', 'mentor', 'who', 'secret', 'own.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'buy', 'film', 'just', 'immerse', 'how', 'westerns', 'used', 'be', 'made', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed']",Legend Of The Golden Gun

You can watch this with the family and it's good over bad guys. So that's important, but the acting is so-so and the story is the same. But if you have good memories of this movie , then buy it, my husband likes it and has played it twice already.

Loved Hal Holbrook, thought Osterhage did a credible job as the movie hero while Robert Davi as the bad guy was definitely a plus. Keir Dullea was a disappointment as Custer, Hollywood continues with the primping, eliteness of Custer as a disappointing hero instead of the courageous, fearless but faulty military leader who would not recognize defeat until it consumed him later in his campaign against plains Indians.",4,"Legend of Golden Gun shines, but not like gold.",1396224000,"03 31, 2014",2014,579,"['Enjoyable', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'presented', 'more', 'pilot', 'television', 'series', 'actually', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'actual', 'ending', 'story', 'plot', 'Loved', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'thought', 'Osterhage', 'did', 'credible', 'job', 'movie', 'hero', 'Robert', 'Davi', 'bad', 'guy', 'was', 'definitely', 'plus', 'Keir', 'Dullea', 'was', 'disappointment', 'Custer', 'Hollywood', 'primping', 'eliteness', 'Custer', 'disappointing', 'hero', 'instead', 'courageous', 'fearless', 'faulty', 'military', 'leader', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'recognize', 'defeat', 'consumed', 'later', 'campaign', 'plains', 'Indians']",Legend Of The Golden Gun
