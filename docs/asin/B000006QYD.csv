BBC brings its world-famous house-style of fairness, objectivity and depth to analyse and comment on Britain's most dire nemesis in the twentieth century - Hitler and his Nazis, and you can expect a top-rate job.  I must have watched the entire documentary series  4 times, and each time I gain fresh and deeper insight.  BBC gave a fasinating and horrific subject an excellent treatment, shorn of emotive propaganda. Explores even-handedly the difficulties Germany was in during the 20's, and explores the psychological attractions of the Nazi party to a down-trodden but proud German people.  The chilling pronogsis which came across is that had Hitler been more sensible in his relations with the USSR and marketed Nazism to the world not as a racial-based ideology but as an international ideology, the Nazis might still be around TODAY. Then, the world will truly see a sort of tyranny as it has never before seen, made infinitely  more terrifying by the twisted lights of science &amp; technology.  A must see.  Every public library and school library must buy this.  Fifty years after they have been bombed into the ground, Nazism remains still an attractive ideology for a lot of people, and has returned to its roots as a protest against the status quo.  This documentary answers why that can be so.  My only grouse is that there is no segment presenting the many interviews BBC and other companies has done of Albert Speer - Hitler's Minister of Munitions.  Now that would have made this series even more cool.",5,An excellently researched and presented BBC product.,977616000,"12 24, 2000",2000,1575,"['Old', 'Beeb', 'never', 'disappoints', 'exception', 'BBC', 'world-famous', 'house-style', 'fairness', 'objectivity', 'depth', 'analyse', 'comment', 'Britain', 'most', 'dire', 'nemesis', 'twentieth', 'century', 'Hitler', 'Nazis', 'can', 'expect', 'top-rate', 'job', 'must', 'have', 'watched', 'entire', 'documentary', 'series', '4', 'times', 'time', 'gain', 'fresh', 'deeper', 'insight', 'BBC', 'gave', 'fasinating', 'horrific', 'subject', 'excellent', 'treatment', 'shorn', 'emotive', 'propaganda', 'even-handedly', 'difficulties', 'Germany', 'was', '20', 'psychological', 'attractions', 'Nazi', 'party', 'down-trodden', 'proud', 'German', 'people', 'chilling', 'pronogsis', 'came', 'across', 'had', 'Hitler', 'been', 'more', 'sensible', 'relations', 'USSR', 'marketed', 'Nazism', 'world', 'not', 'racial-based', 'ideology', 'international', 'ideology', 'Nazis', 'might', 'still', 'be', 'TODAY', 'Then', 'world', 'will', 'truly', 'see', 'sort', 'tyranny', 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'made', 'infinitely', 'more', 'terrifying', 'twisted', 'lights', 'science', 'amp', 'technology', 'must', 'see', 'public', 'library', 'school', 'library', 'must', 'buy', 'Fifty', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'bombed', 'ground', 'Nazism', 'still', 'attractive', 'ideology', 'lot', 'people', 'returned', 'roots', 'protest', 'status', 'quo', 'documentary', 'answers', 'why', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'only', 'grouse', 'segment', 'presenting', 'many', 'interviews', 'BBC', 'other', 'companies', 'done', 'Albert', 'Speer', 'Hitler', 'Minister', 'Munitions', 'Now', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'series', 'even', 'more', 'cool']",The Nazis- The Acclaimed BBC Documentary VHS

Six hours of documentary VHS provide enough detail and analysis to satisfy almost everyone.  For the sake of brevity, the narrator did not say that it was more the Bavarians (&#34;God is on our side&#34;) than Germans from other parts who were surprised by the November 11th Armistice and who relished blaming the Socialist government for a &#34;stab in the back&#34;.  The narrator also did not say that it was General Ludendorff, chief of staff to Marshal Hindenburg, who had suggested to the Government in August 1918, that they negotiate for an armistice with the Allies, a fact that the 1920s Nazi movement in Bavaria chose to ignore.Also, the narrator script left for other documentaries the errors in conduct of the war after 1940 that ultimately led to the several attempts by German officers to kill Hitler.But THE NAZIS is excellent in describing the real Adolf Hitler as seen by those who were close to him (lazy and poorly organized behind the scenes); and it provides very interesting detail about how the Germans controlled occupied territories.",5,Rise and Fall,1398902400,"05 1, 2014",2014,1129,"['excellent', 'basic', 'understanding', 'Nazis', 'Hitler', 'Six', 'hours', 'documentary', 'VHS', 'provide', 'enough', 'detail', 'analysis', 'satisfy', 'almost', 'everyone', 'sake', 'brevity', 'narrator', 'did', 'not', 'say', 'was', 'more', 'Bavarians', '34', 'God', 'side', '34', 'Germans', 'other', 'parts', 'who', 'were', 'surprised', 'November', '11th', 'Armistice', 'who', 'relished', 'blaming', 'Socialist', 'government', '34', 'stab', 'back', '34', 'narrator', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'say', 'was', 'General', 'Ludendorff', 'chief', 'staff', 'Marshal', 'Hindenburg', 'who', 'had', 'suggested', 'Government', 'August', '1918', 'negotiate', 'armistice', 'Allies', 'fact', '1920s', 'Nazi', 'movement', 'Bavaria', 'chose', 'ignore.Also', 'narrator', 'script', 'left', 'other', 'documentaries', 'errors', 'conduct', 'war', '1940', 'ultimately', 'led', 'several', 'attempts', 'German', 'officers', 'kill', 'Hitler.But', 'THE', 'NAZIS', 'excellent', 'describing', 'real', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'seen', 'who', 'were', 'close', 'lazy', 'poorly', 'organized', 'scenes', 'very', 'interesting', 'detail', 'how', 'Germans', 'controlled', 'occupied', 'territories']",The Nazis- The Acclaimed BBC Documentary VHS

This film is long (five vhs videos) but well worth watching. I was particularly impressed with the interviews that they attained; former Nazis as well as victims of the regime. They also interviewed Germans who witnessed these times and events and asked them the hard questions such as ""why didn't you do anything?"" and ""why did you participate in persecuting the Jews?""This documentary has plenty of footage and clearly presents the events that took place under Nazism. Although there is no groundbreaking research presented here, I learned about events that I had no idea took place. The focus of this documentary is ""a warning from history"" and they clearly present this theme throughout this film. There are lessons to be learned about the power of ideology, nationalism and racism and how these streams of thoughts were used to sway a population and the danger of this happening again.",4,Well-done documentary,1127952000,"09 29, 2005",2005,1032,"['found', 'be', 'well-done', 'informative', 'documentary', 'focused', 'impact', 'Nazism', 'local', 'population', 'as', 'well', 'Europe', 'film', 'long', 'five', 'vhs', 'videos', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'interviews', 'attained', 'former', 'Nazis', 'as', 'well', 'victims', 'regime', 'also', 'interviewed', 'Germans', 'who', 'witnessed', 'times', 'events', 'asked', 'hard', 'questions', 'such', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'why', 'did', 'participate', 'persecuting', 'Jews', 'documentary', 'plenty', 'footage', 'clearly', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'Nazism', 'groundbreaking', 'research', 'presented', 'here', 'learned', 'events', 'had', 'idea', 'took', 'place', 'focus', 'documentary', 'warning', 'history', 'clearly', 'present', 'theme', 'film', 'are', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'power', 'ideology', 'nationalism', 'racism', 'how', 'streams', 'thoughts', 'were', 'used', 'sway', 'population', 'danger', 'happening', 'again']",The Nazis- The Acclaimed BBC Documentary VHS
