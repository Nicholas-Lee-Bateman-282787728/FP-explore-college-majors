I watched the cartoons regularly, and each movie as it came out. The franchise had a good run, but I didn't expect to see it come back. Much to my surprise, in 2003 a brand new cartoon appeared--and the turtles were more serious, the Shredder was actually intimidating, rather than the bumbling villain from the 80s--it didn't take long before I was sucked in. But the DVD releases were lackluster. When everyone else was releasing season sets for $40-$50, you could only buy TMNT episodes 3 to a disc at $15! So I held off on buying them, hoping the company would come to their senses. And now that I was just getting to the point of thinking I would have to go hunt down all the older 3-episode DVDs, they finally wised up! I feel bad for those who already bought the older DVDs, but I'm very glad they are finally being released in this format. It's better for collectors, and more friendly to those who might not have wanted to pay so much for the single discs (like me).The 2003 cartoon has had great art/animation, and a more serious, exciting tone that has made it alot of fun to watch. If you were a fan of the old show but have never seen this, give it a try, you won't be disappointed.Since no one else has posted it, here's a list of the episodes that should be on this disc (from an online episode guide-may vary a little):1- 1 Things Change1- 2 A Better Mousetrap (1)1- 3 Attack of the Mousers (2)1- 4 Meet Casey Jones1- 5 Nano1- 6 Darkness on the Edge of Town1- 7 The Way of Invisibility1- 8 Fallen Angel1- 9 Garbageman1-10 The Shredder Strikes (1)1-11 The Shredder Strikes (2)1-12 The Unconvincing Turtle TitanOverall this should be a great set of solid episodes.

However, its not a good thing for those who spend probablly $40-50 on an entire season or 2.  But anyways when they did release these DVD's they left out the closed captioning/subtitles & they really have no bonus features.  I guess they're tryin to do this the cheap way & sooner or later these dvds won't last for the sheer fact they will release others in its place.I enjoyed watching the original 1987 series as a kid & i loved it! They had plenty of different episodes to keep everyone entertained & to be honest its a classic!  I saw the movies & they were not bad but they were not the best made movies ever.  I noticed it was pretty unrealistic but for a 90's movie who would expect it to be that way.  Not to mention most of the dialog is pretty embarrassing. I think the original tv cartoon definatly surpasses the movies.But when i heard they were redoing the series & following it closer to the comics i was pretty shocked of how it came out. I never realized the original series was nothing like the comics.  Many people may not like the new series but i honestly, think its a great improvement.  I still hear that this new series is still not really as close to the comics as it should be, really i wonder if the TMNT comics are really for kids. They did make this new series try to be more kids like & they even have the Fast Foward more for kids then the first 5 seasons.  I wonder if they will put the actual comics onto a dvd set like they did with the Xmen comics.

The episodes on this set were previously released as individual 3-episode discs by Funi and 4Kids.While it's not perfect, this is a quality series, and is probably the best thing with 4Kids' name attached to it. The show has a more mature look compared to the 80s series, much more in line with Justice League and today's action shows. Some characters like Baxter and April are closer to the original comics, while others like the Shredder have their origins retooled for a few new surprises. The best part about this new series is the strong continuity from episode to episode. Things that happen in one episode affect the next one, and elements introduced here affect seasons down the line. It's quite enjoyable.With the first twelve episodes we're introduced to all the main players, filled in on the Turtles' history, and led up to the first major battle with the Shredder. It's all solid, but it's small change compared to what later episodes will pull off. The second volume of season 1 will be much more exciting. Fans who've seen this before or bought the old volumes will find nothing new. No bonus features either, a disappointment.
