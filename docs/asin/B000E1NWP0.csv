Actually, most of what we watch any more are British stories because American TV is so bad.  If it weren't for FOX News and FOX Business, Discovery, the History Channels, and so on there wouldn't be anything worth watching.  The book that comes with the Morse set is very helpful as well and very interesting.  The only negative comment is the wooden box.

An educated Oxford man who becomes a DI in Oxford is a pretty interesting premise.  He also loves all the things an educated man loves, the opera, good books, for example.  Morse is a very cool, very cerebral detective who doesn't suffer fools gladly.  He has no personal life (wife, children, friends, family) which is about par with detectives in these series.The mysteries are well crafted and I can't fault the execution of the mysteries in any way.  They are up to the BBC MYSTERY series standards all the way.  The reason I can't go to 5 stars though is that I just can't adore Morse the way I can Jack Frost, or Tony Hill or Ross Tanner (other detectives in the BBC MYSTERY series).  I am not faulting John Thaw, the actor who plays Morse.  I think he brings him to life exactly as depicted in the novels. If you already love the character Morse the detective, then my preferences  will not affect you in the least.Frankly, I do not have an extra four hundred plus dollars to spend on a tv series. I watched all of these for free courtesy of my public library.  I may want to watch these again some day to see if I have warmed to Morse further but I will just drive less than a mile down the road to scoop them off of the shelf at the library where no one else is using them (because they are busy viewing all the new stuff).

This excellence is attributable to a unique combination of factors--brilliant writing, the casting of an actor (John Thaw) who added great depth and complexity to the lead character, the Oxford setting (which provided rich atmosphere as well as compelling plotlines), wonderful music, talented directors, outstanding supporting actors and guest casts.  The series got better and better over the years as the characters developed individually and in their relationships with each other, and as information about their pasts was gradually revealed.  Kevin Whately, who plays Sergeant Lewis, does a remarkable job of creating a character who is, in his way, as interesting as Morse because of the way he subtly matures.

966031,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B000E1NWP0,Happy Reader,"[3, 3]","""Inspector Morse"" first premiered on BBC in 1987 - and yet it does not feel dated. Only occasionally are you reminded it is an older show - once when someone types a letter using carbon paper, and once with a computer using the old DOS (remember green letters on a black screen?)!I can put up with that, given the exceptional scripts and characterizations. I wish I had room here to give you a synopsis of every episode, or even my favorite episodes. For that matter, there are some scenes which stand out in their excellence.Inspector Morse (played by John Thaw, now deceased) is cranky, intelligent, tenacious and curious. He loves his pint, he's addicted to crosswords, and he seems to only be attracted to women who are in love with someone else. He is a bull-dog when he sniffs something odd, and he frequently gets in trouble for overstepping.His murder mysteries are anything but run-of-the-mill and definitely excellent entertainment.At the time I write this,Inspector Morse - Complete Collection, complete with a wooden box, has a $470 price-tag. It does go on special once in a while, so there are times you can get it cheaper. It includes two 50-minute specials, ""The Story of Morse"" and ""The Making of Morse"". It does not include the 25th anniversary special, ""Inspector Morse's Oxford"".There is one other ""Inspector Morse"" complete set available on amazon, called the 25th Anniversary Collection. And there are two different lines of boxed sets available. You can also buy ""The Making of Morse"" and ""Inspector Morse's Oxford"" separately. ""The Story of Morse"" is not available to buy separately, but is included with one of the Collection Sets, the Complete Collection and the 25th Anniversary Collection.The DVD of ""Inspector Morse's Oxford"" can be purchased separately, and it is included in the 25th Anniversary Collection.I thought I'd give you a run-down of the options for collecting Inspector Morse.[Note, added later: The prices mentioned in this review are as of November, 2012, when I wrote the review.

966035,A168VXSISJWQN9,B000E1NWP0,"John D. Muir ""oldies and pies lover""","[1, 1]","...he would probably have been Inspector Morse. This is not a fast-paced action series, with lots of dramatic confrontations and shoot-outs. Morse is cerebral, rather gloomy, with a love for classical music and real ale (especially when bought by his faithful sidekick, Sergeant Lewis!). He doesn't like the sight of blood and leaves the more physical side of policing to the uniform branch. Morse is a rebel working in a team, an academic who is contemptuous of academia, a loner who longs for female companionship; in fact, a mass of contradictions. Like Holmes, what he does is who he is and he is impatient that it isn't so for everyone. Poor Lewis, who does have a life outside his job, is constantly called upon to drop everything at Morse's whim.Such a character would be easy to dislike, but in the hands of John Thaw Morse's foibles become not only acceptable but part of his considerable charm. Morse is vulnerable as well as demanding, compassionate as well as socially awkward. He solves the crimes he is confronted with by using his powers of deduction and knowledge of human nature, not by following tedious routine police methods. His attitude doesn't endear him to his superiors, but he gets results. He's an anachronism in a modern police force- a classical scholar (albeit a failed one) in a job that doesn't cater to intellectual refinement.The crimes are interesting, the setting is magnificent and the supporting cast is first-class, led by Lewis (Kevin Whately) who is strong enough to carry a successful series on his own. Morse is the benchmark for quality detective shows on TV. Like everyone else, I'm appalled at the price that the complete collection is being offered for; I have all the shows, but collected individually over time. The fact that even so I paid considerably less than the cost of this box set just indicates how overpriced the set is. Surely the loss in numbers of sales must far outweigh the revenue generated by the high price?However, if you can afford it (or buy it more cheaply in other ways) this is one series you will never regret purchasing.

I thought long and hard about this investment and I have to say I am so glad I took the plunge.We had already watched the Inspector Lewis series before we started watching Morse.  We are planning on watching Lewis again from start to finish.Morse is not exactly a lovable old curmudgeon much of the time.  The dynamic between Morse and Lewis is really wonderful to watch.  Morse is such a legend in the department (with both accolades and blemishes) that it takes a while for Lewis to find his footing.  However, by the end it is clear (and kind of fun) to realize that Lewis makes a huge contribution to solving each crime.  Sometimes while Morse is spouting off or getting reprimanded or whatever, Lewis's facial expressions are priceless.Some of the episodes were quite haunting and will stay with me for a long while.The book is very handy for keeping track are if you are watching the episodes in sequence.  Each episode is on a separate CD so it's easy to forget where you are.  Be aware, though, that the book contains plot summaries and spoilers abound.When you consider everything that comes in this set - 55 hours of video, a nice book with photos and details of the locations, a storage box - it really is worth the money.  How much does a single 90-minute DVD cost?  (let alone a night out to actually go to the movies)  Also Amazon has the best price I found by far.

Perhaps it's because the classically beautiful city of Oxford is not only the physical location for most of the stories, but also an ideal intellectual setting for plots featuring characters engaged in the life of the mind.The first time I heard Morse repeating the last verses of Tennyson's poem ""Ulysses"" to Chief Superintendent Strange--""Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'We are not now that strength which in old daysMoved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are....""--I knew I was hooked on Morse for life.I'm glad PBS decided to produce the Inspector Lewis series with some of the same characters and aesthetics as Morse. While I've been happy to see Kevin Whately return in his role as Lewis, it's Detective Sergeant Hathaway who reminds me most of their predecessor, the intriguingly intelligent and brooding Morse.If you enjoy Morse, Lewis, and Hathaway as I do, you might also be interested in a recently published novel by John Rather titled Arius, available at Amazon. It's an intelligent thriller that begins at the University of Oxford with a murder resulting from the response people have to a controversial viewpoint dating back to the Nicene Council.",5,Highly literate as well as entertaining,1338595200,"06 2, 2012",2012,1311,"['purchased', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'DVDs', 'have', 'watched', 'episodes', 'over', 'again', ""'ve"", 'never', 'found', 'series', 'better', 'Perhaps', 'classically', 'beautiful', 'city', 'Oxford', 'not', 'only', 'physical', 'location', 'most', 'stories', 'also', 'ideal', 'intellectual', 'setting', 'plots', 'featuring', 'characters', 'engaged', 'life', 'mind.The', 'first', 'time', 'heard', 'Morse', 'repeating', 'last', 'verses', 'Tennyson', 'poem', 'Ulysses', 'Chief', 'Superintendent', 'Strange', 'Tho', 'much', 'taken', 'much', 'abides', ""tho'We"", 'are', 'not', 'now', 'strength', 'old', 'daysMoved', 'earth', 'heaven', 'are', 'are', 'knew', 'was', 'hooked', 'Morse', 'life.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'PBS', 'decided', 'produce', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'series', 'same', 'characters', 'aesthetics', 'Morse', ""'ve"", 'been', 'happy', 'see', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'return', 'role', 'Lewis', 'Detective', 'Sergeant', 'Hathaway', 'who', 'most', 'predecessor', 'intriguingly', 'intelligent', 'brooding', 'Morse.If', 'enjoy', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'Hathaway', 'do', 'might', 'also', 'be', 'interested', 'recently', 'published', 'novel', 'John', 'Rather', 'titled', 'Arius', 'available', 'Amazon', 'intelligent', 'thriller', 'University', 'Oxford', 'murder', 'resulting', 'response', 'people', 'have', 'controversial', 'viewpoint', 'dating', 'back', 'Nicene', 'Council']",Inspector Morse - Complete Collection
