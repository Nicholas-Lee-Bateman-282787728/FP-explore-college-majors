At first he is filled with excitement as he discusses with his family his dreams of a corporation to manufacture these wipers.  He wants  his family to be involved and they are all on board.  However, after he presents his idea to Ford Automobile Company, he realizes that they have stolen his idea and it drives him over the brink, literally.Kearns becomes obsessed with the ethics of the situation.  He wants it to be known that he is the inventor of the intermittent wiper, holds the patent, and will go to court to protect his good name.  Ethics has always been important to him.  As the movie starts we hear him talking about how engineers can be involved in making machinery for Auschwitz or they can be involved in making things to help humanity.  Kearns applies this code of ethics to himself.  Stealing is wrong.  He will not accept money from Ford to shut him up.  He wants a public apology published in the paper and an acknowledgment that he is the true inventor.He ends up alienating his attorneys, his friends and his family who can not understand his obsession with winning this case in court his way.  It's not the money that is important.  It is the ethics of the situation.  What ends up happening?

All the major car companies, including Ford and GM, have been trying for years to come up with an intermittent windshield wiper that actually works, but Kearns beats them to it. When he meets with a Ford representative, he comes away thinking they have an arrangement: he will manufacture the wipers and Ford will purchase them. But Ford backs out of the deal and shortly after that introduces their own intermittent windshield wiper on their new cars. Although Kearns holds five patents to the wiper, it takes hims several years to get his case into court, during which time his wife leaves him and he becomes estranged from some of his children. The film follows the trial and Kearns's dogged determination to be the acknowledged inventor of the intermittent wiper. He turns down a 30 million dollar offer from Ford when they refuse to admit he is the inventor and that they stole the technique from him.Kinnear excellently portrays Kearns as a man of principle who is willing to give up most of his life to pursuing righting a wrong and does not back down from a huge corporation who will go to, at times unethical, extremes to protect themselves.

1158746,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00188KD2I,Chris Pandolfi,"[25, 26]","I don't know how accurately ""Flash of Genius"" portrays the real Robert Kearns. If he was anything like Greg Kinnear's representation, he may be one of the most relatable people I know of. In the film, Kearns is passionate, determined, stubborn, and cursed with a one-track mind. He was a college engineering professor and an independent inventor with an absolute sense of right and wrong, and because the Ford Motor Company wrongs him, he puts all his energy into making it right. We may not all be inventors, but I think it's safe to say that most of us understand why he does what he does, and that's because we've all been passionate about something. This isn't to say that we can completely side with him; as admirable as his intentions are, he ends up neglecting his wife, his children, and his job, and he unfairly drags his family through a twelve-year legal nightmare. One wonder whether or not the journey was worth it.The Kearns character is the lifeblood of ""Flash of Genius."" He holds everything together, and that's because the filmmakers develop him far more than any other character. This was done on purpose, I suspect. This is his dream, his effort, his obsession--everyone else is either along for the ride or left standing at the curb. The film's structure is just as narrow-minded as Kearns is, which will be problematic if you want a story that develops all of its characters. I wasn't bothered by it, and that's because I wanted to see things from his perspective. I wanted to understand why he believed so strongly when others didn't. I wanted to be convinced that he was doing the right thing by fighting a gigantic corporation that ripped off his windshield wiper design. I'm not too sure about that last one; he refuses each and every offer to settle, even when handsome sums of money are involved. The principle is to never give in, and while it's a good principle, it's also not very helpful for a family's financial security.Where the film falters is in matters of time passage. While the occasional, ""Four years later,"" is displayed, there are still far too many gaps. Kearns' children grow up before our eyes, and his hair seems to get grayer with every passing scene. I'm not entirely sure what year the story begins in. I can only go by actual history, which tells us that Kearns first came up with the idea of the intermittent windshield wiper in 1963, as he and his family were driving on a misty night in Detroit, Michigan. In the film, Kearns is bothered by the fact that his car's wipers can only move at a set speed. He then remembers his honeymoon night ten years earlier, in which a champagne cork hit him in the eye; with a little engineering, windshield wipers just might be able to operate in much the same way as an eyelid, which blinks at an intermittent rate. He proceeds to build a prototype in his basement.In 1967, Kearns and his business partner, Gil Privick (Dermot Mulroney), patent the new wiper system. They then show the device to the Ford Motor Company, who seem genuinely interested, if a little too curious; they want to know how the device works, but Kearns won't tell them, not until a deal can be worked out. A Ford exec (Mitch Pileggi) appears intrigued on the surface, but we suspect that underneath, he cares nothing for Kearns. He just wants the device, and true to form, he makes it so that the company backs out of the deal and installs Kearns' wiper system in all the newest car models. It's a reliable but nonetheless unoriginal method for developing a movie villain. This isn't to say that such people don't exist in real life; I'm well aware that major corporations--and the people who run them--have been known to be greedy and corrupt. But since we're talking about a movie here, it might have been better if the filmmakers had taken a different approach.Kearns carries his anger and resentment all the way to 1982, when, after years of fighting uphill legal battles, he was finally able to sue the Ford Motor Company. Because his relationship with his attorney (Alan Alda) had soured, Kearns decided to represent himself. Some will see this movie and determine that Kearns gave up too much to get that far. It takes thirteen years to see the process through, and at a certain point, his wife, Phyllis (Lauren Graham), and their children begin to feel abandoned. On top of that, Kearns is continuously offered large cash settlements in exchange for dropping the lawsuit. Because they refuse to admit any wrongdoing, Kearns always turns their offers down.On the other hand, some audiences will completely side with Kearns, believing that the principle is more important than the money. I have to admit that I'm on the fence. Is it worth it to keep fighting a powerful corporation, even when you know you're right? Is it worth it to stand up for what you believe in while your loved ones are left in the sidelines? What makes ""Flash of Genius"" work so well is the fact that we're made to see everything from a very single-minded perspective, which in turn allows us to understand the main character. I'm surprised it worked, considering the fact that stories told from multiple perspectives are more complex, more thought provoking, and more compelling. We're immersed in one man's quest for justice, and we see him through to the end. I won't reveal what happens, even if you know everything about case. But rest assured, it ends appropriately, and it reminds us that, with determination, even insignificant people can make a big difference.",4,Inspiration Comes to Those Who Blink,1223424000,"10 8,

His widow ultimately prevailed when case was settled, about 40 years later.  And what about Tom Scholz vs. his record company?

1158748,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B00188KD2I,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 2]","The new film, Flash Of Genius, by first time director Marc Abraham, is one of those films that is well made, well acted, well shot, and technically, there is little to argue with. But, it's still utterly predictable; as predictable as the sports film that features an underdog you just know will win in the end. As with most films that ultimately fail, this film fails for its screenplay. No film can succeed without a good screenplay- one with good dialogue, good characterization, and a good tale. The plot, also, has to come alive, and distinguish itself. Given that this film was based on reality, this constricts, a bit, the play one can have with the reality. So, this is where perspective comes in. Instead of a biopic that tells the whole tale (and at almost two hours in length, this film is 20-40 minutes too long; filled with unneeded passages showing the development of the intermittent windshield wiper, as well as far too much interaction between the lead character, Robert Kearns (Greg Kinnear) and his best friend, Gil Previck (Dermot Mulroney), who disappears 40% of the way into the film, only for a token reappearance at end, when- of course, the little guy perseveres and wins his legal case in the end) there needed to be a set pivot point in the man's life, from which all else could be parallaxed. Now, the problem. It just took a few minutes of researching the life of the real Robert Kearns to see that the film took dramatic liberties with the lawsuit aspect of the tale- Kearns didn't beat the Ford Motor Company in court- he settled, and then beat Chrysler. There are also other elements about the times that events took place in that are not correct. Why this is important is not because art is truth, or nonsense like that, but because it removes the excuses for screenwriter Philip Railsback that all he had to fall back on was the truth.The good is the acting of Kinnear, who is truly the modern equivalent to Jimmy Stewart- an everyman, far much more so than Tom Hanks has ever been. Kinnear can do drama like Hanks never can. Graham is also very good, and the fact that she does not reconcile with Kearns, after his victory, is one of the lone bright spots in the screenplay- based on truth or not. But, so much of the second half of the film is wasted on moments that have been slapped together from so many other us vs. them films that only the winsomeness of Graham and the likeability of Kinnear prevent narcolepsy. The principled stand that Kearns makes is an engine for the film, but little else. Mitch Pileggi (of X-Files fame) is good as a scumbag Ford bigwig, and there is potential in familial scenes between Kearns and his six kids (both older and younger sets, as the film takes place over more than a decade), but it is never exploited. Too much time, instead, is wasted on Bob's failures with his friend Gil, and a lawyer, Greg Lawson, played by Alan Alda, who cares not for justice, just money. One good aspect of the film is that it opens with Kearns dazed and confused, a couple of years after his being screwed by Ford, only to make that opening worthless, with a flashback to how he got there, and then, an hour in, we catch up, and proceed chronologically. This does not work because it is a fence sitting position. Since events before and after proceed linearly, why do we start off with the hiccup? And then, we see the scene play out a second time. The screenplay should have either played the film from beginning to end, or played around with time and perception inside the character's mind, especially since he did spend time in a loony bin, and after being released from it, according to the film, was never quite the same. Kinnear displays this subtle change in character wonderfully, and may get an Oscar nod for it- a perfect example of how one can see great aspects in a mediocre work of art.Reputedly, although the bulk of the film is set in Detroit, is was mostly filmed in Hamilton, Ontario, for too much of Detroit has decayed to the point of no return to stand in for its 1960s heyday, when most of the film is set. The title comes from the Flash Of Genius test for patentability, where the Supreme Court affirmed an invention could come to an inventor out of nowhere, without years of work beforehand. The story comes from a 1993 article, by John Seabrook, in the New Yorker, on Kearns, with the same title. But, facts like that are mere trivia. What can set a film apart and above (aside from the already mentioned `hard' aspects of the art) are the intangibles, something Flash Of Genius just does not have. Why? If one could pinpoint that, they would not be intangibles, and this film would rise a few notches, to the level of films like Inherit The Wind or Erin Brockovich, both films like this, that are definite `prose' works, but works whose prose is more akin to a Herman Hesse or Mark Twain, rather than a soap opera. As for poetry? Perhaps Ford stole that, too.

Greg comes out swinging in this film. He is simply remarkable as the possessed engineer Bob Kearns that invented the intermittent windshield wiper. Lauren Graham is his gorgeous wife, Phyllis. Where Kinnear ages during this many years film, Graham does not age much. She does come off a bit young for the mother of the seven children.This is a long film, almost 2 hours. The director played with the timeline in a needlessly confusing way, through subtitles. The film opens with a scene that is then rewound to three years earlier. And the time increments just get stranger and stranger. About 1/4 of the way through the film the viewer is now back at the same time as the opening of the film. In fact it gets very hard to figure out, what will the rest of the film be about. By about the first half hour, he's already invented, tried to build and sell the device, been shot down, had the idea stolen by Ford, and goes crazy. Never fear the rest of the film is interesting, but it does feel spent after that first half hour. Although the viewer is treated to strange time jumps, a month here, a few months there, a year here, another few years here, and four years there....The topic of the film is that age old, an individual stands up for what they beleive is right, to heck with money and any other damage that fight might bring. That theme is well played, well told in this film.This is not the best edited film. There are some pacing issues, mostly taking too long to get to the point. The moved around timeline really gets in the way of telling this story, it was almost an artificial effect to create interest. The other technical components are well done, decent filming, and sound well recorded. Music was subtle and supported the film very well.The DVD has a few deleted scenes. Several should stay deleted, a few actually belonged in the film. There were moments where the film had been edited down to reach a certain film length. Certain story elements were left hanging and those two deleted scenes would have helped.The film is PG-13, for language, and it is reasonably mild use not gratitous. There is no nudity. No real eroticism either, simply a moment early on where Phyllis asks Bob if he'd like to make another child. This is a film that younger viewers might want to watch with parents. There is a fantastic story for discussion about doing the right thing.Flash Of Genius was a bit of a surprise. Greg Kinnear was a stand out. The story was moving.

The reason is simple! I can identify with what Dr. Kearns went through, having had a somewhat similar gut-wrenching experience as a whistleblower.I really don't think most people can begin to understand what it is like to stand up for one's  honor  and to confront a powerful institution, such as a huge transnational corporation, (or in my case a government agency) -  no matter what the personal cost.Making matters even more difficult is that many  politicians with a conservative bent love to turn the issue of  litigation awards into a political football! Oh, how rich and powerful institutions are the ""victims"" of shady lawyers and questionable plaintiffs,  they cry! But what these unethical politicians don't tell you is the mind-boggling amount of work that goes into preparing  your case before you can even find a lawyer willing to take it! Or, that no matter how serious the injury, there's no guarantee your case will ever see the light of day!This true story is also about love & family! Dr. Kearns is so fortunate to have such wonderful children.  It's amazing how much can be accomplished when a human being gets emotional and logistical support from those he  loves!

1158752,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,B00188KD2I,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[3, 4]","This afternoon it was raining in New York as I drove out to Garden City to show Deb my alma mater. It wasn't raining very hard when I activated my windshield wipers to operate intermittently. In a flash of genius, I knew I had to write this review. The story kept coming back as I passed by buildings of my past and new ones that were built since my last visit.Robert Kearns, played by George Kinnear, is an automotive engineer who comes up with the idea of windshield wipers that work intermittently, when it's not raining that hard to have them wiping regularly but not enough to turn them off. He sells the idea to Ford but wants to do the work himself. Sure enough, Ford reneges on their deal, and he discovers they stole his invention one rainy night as he follows a Ford executive to his home.He decides to take action by hiring a legal team led and played by Alan Alda that tries to wow him with a settlement of a paulty quarter million with no admission of guilt, but that is the key. He wants Ford to admit their perfidy and it becomes his mission to get it. It doesn't come without costs. He fires the law firm, and that's when his obsession and stubborness begin to take the air out of the tires of his marriage. He literally blows a mental gasket along the way, suffering a deep depression exacerbated by hallucinations. Despite these setbacks, he learns enough about the law to initiate legal action and to try to put the brakes on Ford's theft.As we see a man destitute emotionally, economically, and personally by his experience, we see a Ford representative stopping by and uping the ante to curb Kearn's relentless pursuit of social justice. An offer in the thousands, turns into a final offer of a million to settle, to another final offer of $30 million on the eve of the trial. It involves no admission of guilt. Kearns now consults his kids who he missed growing up, but who have now have resolved their differences with their dad. They ultimately give him the thumbs down on the offer and urge him to pursue even though he might lose everything. This is the ultimate act of courage, to refuse the bird in the hand by going after the two in the bush.The courtroom is perhaps Kinnear's finest performance. He manages to present simply and methodically what constitutes an original idea, or a flash of genius. His presentation is awkward at first, passionate without being emotional. It tugs at a jury's sense of fair play, even influencing the judge. How the jury will decide will vindicate all he has sacrificed for, or it could put him in an emotional and economic pit that will be an endless depth of despair.This is a first for George Kinnear, playing the lead role, and making the most of it.

Like the guy who invented Kleenex, Band-Aids, Q-Tips? Here's one for ya. This is a fine biopic film (more or less), a rather deep yet compelling drama, which is a tough, tough cinematic confection to offer well. It is the story of one man standing up for himself in his field or profession, and it is a courtroom drama too.This is the story of Dr. Robert Kearns (handily performed by Greg Kinnear), auto engineer not-so-extraordinaire, but brilliant enough to have equated windshield wipers with the human eyelid. Result: intermittent wipers!As an automotive employee, Kearns gets in trouble with everyone from his obnoxious pretend-friend boss (a rather evil looking Dermot Mulroney) to the big wigs at Ford (led by Macklin Tyler, played by the ever menacing-when-he-has-to-be Mitch Pileggi).What fun! And no references to the rather childishly filmed TUCKER!Finally, after a nervous breakdown comes the courtroom showdown. I love seeing Kinnear waving what I hope I remember is one of Dickens' novels, it's probably not, I think perhaps it was War and Peace--anyway, it's a brilliant slap in the face of the Ford people, and if anyone knows Kearn's story, he didn't stop with those guys, though the film does end it there.Alan Alda's performance as sleazebag attorney Gregory Lawson is high-pitched and high-octane. It made us shiver...we're surrounded by lawyers we know, and that is EXACTLY what they are like and how they act. Alda even has the different pitches of the voice on the money. The screwing Atty. Lawson gives Dr. Kearns is so sad, yet so true to life, that this is a moment in the film when I usually shed a tear...and I am serious.I've been through a handful of such ordeals, but nothing to compare to the nightmare of Bob Kearns. He had to become a lawyer, his own accountant, office manager, and private secretary (though his boys did help him when they were little). This can sap the spirit of any inventor. What a fight, and a what happy ending.The best about this film aside from its realism is that it is a solid, meat-n-potato winner that deserved tons of Oscars. Well, at least three that I can think of just now. It's solid family viewing, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to all families.

Kern gets the whole family involved and seems on his way to riches, when his idea is swiped by the management of Ford Motor Company. The film deals with his efforts to manufacture the wipers on his own and prove his authorship in court.Kinnear did a nice job of playing Kearns, and gave him a little of the obsessed and complex personality that the man must have had. The Ford baddies, led by Alan Alda, came off as basically evil.

These devices make our days easier, with little to no fanfare.  We are so used to such conveniences that we never see them, and we certainly never think about them.  This film, FLASH OF GENIUS, is the story of the man who invented one such convenience device, the intermittent windshield wiper.  Do you even remember a time before we had them?  I don't; I mean, not really.  Oh, I do know that there were invented in my lifetime, but I certainly don't think about them or really remember when they came into being.  But now, I expect every car on the road to have them.The intermittent windshield wiper was invented by Robert Kearns, a college professor and regular family man with a lovely wife and a passel of kids. FLASH OF GENIUS is his story.  His life is completely changed when he invents the mechanism that allows drivers to control the interval between the ""blinking"" of the blades on a windshield wiper. Dr.  Kearns patents his invention and takes it to the Ford Motor Company. Ford is VERY interested (Bob Kearns has done what all the Ford engineers have failed to do) but in the end, they refuse to give him a contract.  When Dr. Kearns later learns that Ford has installed the intermittent wipers on their cars, he takes the Ford Motor Company to court for patent infringement, but finds that he is David to their Goliath.  They drag out his case nearly 30 years.  Bob ends up in a psychiatric hospital, with no family, few friends, and nothing to show for his ingenuity.  In the end, Bob does triumph.  But was it worth the horrible price?As I said earlier, FLASH OF GENIUS is a very difficult movie to watch.  You ache for this man, as Ford beats him down over and over again.  Their treatment of him is detestable and painful to watch as he loses more and more of his life, and it is a testament to Robert Kearns' internal strength and perseverance that he keeps trying.Greg Kinnear gives the performance of a lifetime as Robert Kearns.  Kinnear makes this bumbling, awkward, nave professor sympathetic and real.  The rest of the supporting cast does a fine job, but this is Kinnear's movie.  Even a superbly acted appearance by Alan Alda does nothing to lessen the focus on Kinnear's character.FLASH OF GENIUS unfolds quite slowly, quietly reeling the viewer in.  You become emotionally invested in the story.  I can't say I ""enjoyed"" this film, but I certainly found it worth watching.  I learned a thing or two, which is one of the main reasons, IMHO, to watch a movie in the first place.

I was tired when I started watching and fell asleep, due to fatigue not subject matter. When I woke up a couple of hours later, I turned the movie back on. I thought it was more interesting than the usual individual takes on a big corporation idea. To me it was worth the wait to see it finally reach a courtroom, even though it did cost him most things dear in his personal life.It is that spirit which kept me interested. This man refused to give up on his invention, and subsequent offers of money to settle out of court. I liked the fact it made me feel as if it truly was not about money, rather about a man unwilling to allow anyone to take an idea he had based on personal experience. It's easy to say it was long, or it took awhile to conclude. I have to stop and think of how it must have been very frustrating to have lived it, and to have watched it play out in real time.

Meaning, it wasn't just a run of the mill, get rich quick scheme. And while most people may have given up, or simply chose one of the offers, he seemed to want more. He just wanted what was his.

1158767,A22RY8N8CNDF3A,B00188KD2I,"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[1, 2]","""Flash of Genius"" is a true story spanning twenty years of an ordinary man's superhuman fight against a giant auto corporation.  Greg Kinnear stars as Dr. Robert Kearns, a college professor that teaches engineers at a University in Detroit, Michigan.  In the classroom he notes how important ethics is in any occupation.  He is a devout Catholic with six children and a loving wife as the movie starts.  He is also a inventor that comes up with a new windshield wiper with a ""delay"" factor.  He goes to his best friend at a small auto parts company and wants to manufacture the item himself.  The friend recommends working with a large auto giant in the area.  Dr. Kearns is careful that they don't see how it works, as he knows they could take it apart and learn how it works.  When the auto giant steals his idea, he is shocked and furious, his one purpose in life then becomes to have the truth come out that he invented the new wiper.  He has patents to prove it, but is outnumbered in lawyers and money as he decides to take on the case and defend himself in court.The co-stars are Alan Alda, Lauren Graham and Dermot Mulroney.The movie keeps your interest up as you watch his dogged determination. However, the true-to-life story suffers from Kearns' excessive and single-minded insistence on the Big Three admitting they stole from him (a $30 million, plus legal expenses, voluntary payout from Ford) wasn't good enough. Insisting that he manufacture the product was also inept - Kearns had no manufacturing experience, staff, or facilities, and Ford was very much vertically integrated at the time. Kearns ends up losing his sanity, his job, years of his life, and his marriage.",3,Dogged Determination,1271116800,"04 13, 2010",2010,1686,"['Flash', 'Genius', 'true', 'story', 'spanning', 'twenty', 'years', 'ordinary', 'man', 'superhuman', 'fight', 'giant', 'auto', 'corporation', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Dr.', 'Robert', 'Kearns', 'college', 'professor', 'engineers', 'University', 'Detroit', 'Michigan', 'classroom', 'how', 'important', 'ethics', 'occupation', 'devout', 'Catholic', 'six', 'children', 'loving', 'wife', 'movie', 'also', 'inventor', 'up', 'new', 'windshield', 'wiper', 'delay', 'factor', 'best', 'friend', 'small', 'auto', 'parts', 'company', 'manufacture', 'item', 'friend', 'working', 'large', 'auto', 'giant', 'area', 'Dr.', 'Kearns', 'careful', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'could', 'take', 'apart', 'learn', 'how', 'When', 'auto', 'giant', 'steals', 'idea', 'shocked', 'furious', 'one', 'purpose', 'life', 'then', 'have', 'truth', 'come', 'out', 'invented', 'new', 'wiper', 'patents', 'prove', 'outnumbered', 'lawyers', 'money', 'take', 'case', 'defend', 'court.The', 'co-stars', 'are', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney.The', 'movie', 'interest', 'up', 'watch', 'dogged', 'determination', 'However', 'true-to-life', 'story', 'suffers', 'Kearns', 'excessive', 'single-minded', 'insistence', 'Big', 'Three', 'admitting', 'stole', '30', 'million', 'legal', 'expenses', 'voluntary', 'payout', 'Ford', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'Insisting', 'manufacture', 'product', 'was', 'also', 'inept', 'Kearns', 'had', 'manufacturing', 'experience', 'staff', 'facilities', 'Ford', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'vertically', 'integrated', 'time', 'Kearns', 'up', 'losing', 'sanity', 'job', 'years', 'life', 'marriage']",N/A

Kearns invents the intermittent windshield wiper, and Ford--whose engineers had been trying to invent it for years--steals it.  When Kearns does not back down in the face of their refusal to give him credit for his invention, they push harder, but he continues to battle them--one man against a huge corporation.  Most people would have given up or taken the offer early in the game, but Kearns wants what's coming to him for all the hard work he has put into the device.  His persistence is admirable, but it is the reason for it--his commitment to principle--that carries the movie.  At great personal cost, Kearns keeps on trying to get justice from the mega corporation.  What he gets and what he sacrifices when all is said and done is moving.What this movie is really about is reclaiming justice and standing for honor.  Kearns had many opportunities to cave in long before the end of the movie.  He was surrounded by people who thought he should give up, yet he pressed on.  In an era when most people would give in just to have it over with and to gain what in his day was an enormous amount of money, for Kearns to keep battling Ford probably seemed as ludicrous as the movie portrayed it from Ford's point of view.  Yet for the viewer, his resolve is captivating.  Kinnear gives the best performance I have ever seen him give, and he is utterly riveting.  Moreover, he achieves a complexity in the character that is little seen.  He plays Kearns as a devoted family man, a brilliant engineer, an offbeat guy with a quirky sense of humor, a desperate and lonely man, and a sharp thinker who never misses a beat.  His character is more real because of the complexity, and the viewer can't help championing him.Why the story of an inventor who gets cheated out of his due glory is so powerful is that it is the story of everyone who finds himself in a battle against forces greater than himself.  Big corporations tend to think that they can trample over the little people and get away with it just because they're powerful and have deep pockets.  The exploited one's giving up and giving in is expected.  Doing what Kearns does is extraordinary and shows indomitable human spirit and a belief that justice is worth fighting for.""Flash of Genius"" is an excellent movie, and for the many of us who have ever been beaten down by a corporation or other large entity, it is vindicating.  Greg Kinnear's performance is the flash of genius in the movie, although it is more than a flash--more like Halley's Comet--and like Halley's Comet, it will become a perennial favorite, I am convinced.  The four stars are for the fact that the movie is slow in places and for the bittersweet ending.

It occurs to him, why not make a wiper that would 'blink' like your eyes do to clear tears away?He proceeds to do just that. Of course, the automakers are wowed by the idea.  They've had their best minds working on what they call 'intermittent windshield wipers' for quite some time.  Ford Motor Company is willing to buy the wiper invention for their new Mustang and Kearns believes he's set until Ford shuts him out and uses his invention, anyway.In the end, Kearns has to represent himself in court initially against Ford in what everyone tells him is futile, but somehow he manages to win. The film tells the story of the invention, struggle and eventual lawsuit.  Kinnear does a stellar job recreating the taciturn, yet driven professor who only wants credit for his own work.Rebecca Kyle, May 2009",5,Integrity is Job 1,1241395200,"05 4, 2009",2009,1040,"['Driving', 'rainstorm', 'family', 'engineering', 'prof', 'Dennis', 'Kearns', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'get', 'car', 'wipers', 'work', 'right', 'windshield', 'clear', 'Then', 'off', 'rain', 'obscured', 'vision', 'why', 'not', 'make', 'wiper', 'would', ""'blink"", 'eyes', 'do', 'clear', 'tears', 'away', 'do', 'just', 'course', 'automakers', 'are', 'wowed', 'idea', ""'ve"", 'had', 'best', 'minds', 'working', 'what', 'call', ""'intermittent"", 'windshield', 'wipers', 'quite', 'time', 'Ford', 'Motor', 'Company', 'willing', 'buy', 'wiper', 'invention', 'new', 'Mustang', 'Kearns', 'set', 'Ford', 'out', 'invention', 'end', 'Kearns', 'represent', 'court', 'initially', 'Ford', 'what', 'everyone', 'futile', 'somehow', 'win', 'film', 'story', 'invention', 'struggle', 'eventual', 'lawsuit', 'Kinnear', 'stellar', 'job', 'recreating', 'taciturn', 'yet', 'driven', 'professor', 'who', 'only', 'credit', 'own', 'work.Rebecca', 'Kyle', 'May', '2009']",N/A
1158779,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00188KD2I,RMurray847,"[1, 1]","Something I didn't know before:  the intermittent windshield wiper is a marvel of engineering.  I always took it for granted, and thought it was a pretty simple idea.  But in the `50s, all the major American car manufacturers were racing (unsuccessfully) to create one.  That this kind of wiper was a good idea was not the question...how to make one that worked was the insurmountable challenge.Until a physics teacher named Bob Kearns invented it.  And in a happy story, he would have sold his device to Ford or GM, made a big chunk of change up front, been written up in some magazines and then received a nice royalty for each one that sold.Instead, Kearns decided that HE wanted to manufacture them himself, and sell them to the car dealers.  This was NOT acceptable to the car companies (understandably...how could they trust such an important device to a man with no experience in mass production).  So, rather than continue to negotiate...they stole Kearns' idea.  And Kearns spent many, many years trying to get his day in court.  To get money, and to get vindication and recognition.That, in a nutshell, is the basic framework for FLASH OF GENIUS, the story of Bob Kearns' battle with ""big auto"".  We can pretty much predict the basic arc the story is going to take.  Kearns will face struggles.  His family life will suffer.  He will suffer financially.  And he will emerge triumphant and victorious in the end...for FLASH OF GENIUS is in a genre of films closely related to sports movies...the underdog ultimately triumphs.Yet this is a true story, and while I don't know all the details of what this film ""hypothesized"" or ""extrapolated"" and what literally happened...the fact that it's true causes the story to have more than its share of unexpected bumps on the road.  And MANY of those bumps are caused by Kearns himself.As played by Greg Kinnear, Bob Kearns is an affable, slightly nerdy ""nice"" guy (can anyone do affable better than Kinnear these days?).  He's a smart man with a burning desire to teach the joys of science...and a burning desire to make a fortune through the power of his own inventiveness.  These are GOOD things, more or less.  But we soon learn that Kearns is also an unreasonably stubborn man.  While there is no question that Kearns was...frankly...screwed by the car companies, we can also see that Kearns own stubbornness and unwillingness to compromise didn't do him a lot of favors.Kearns has a beautiful, loving family...headed up by his strong, sensible wife Phyllis (Lauren Graham, looking and acting JUST right for the time period).  Yet, despite opportunities to settle and chances to move on with some grace...Kearns clings to his beliefs even as his family is pushed away.I don't really want to say a lot more about how the story all plays out...but suffice it to say that FLASH OF GENIUS is at least half about how one man slowly descends into madness.  Not the ""put him in a straightjacket and give him electroshock"" kind of ""movie insanity,"" but a more subtle and chilling kind.Kinnear does outstanding work yet again.  It's funny, after all these years, I keep expecting him to stink.  After all, wasn't he just the smarmy host of ""Talk Soup?""  Even after an Oscar nomination, and great performances in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, AUTO FOCUS and more...he keeps surprising me.  To be honest, he hardly seems to act at all...he just becomes these guys.  He is clearly selective about the work he chooses to do and generally understands what he's good at.  But  he's VERY good at it.  He has a nice chemistry with Graham and all the kids.  It's just a very solid performance that makes the entire film work.There are nice supporting performances from a good cast: Dermot Mulroney and Alan Alda spring to mind, but everyone is good.  The art direction and costumes are spot on.Honestly, there is nothing wrong with this film...except its scope.  It's a ""little"" story, told with an easygoing style.  It's not trying to say anything global in scope.  It has no flashy scenes or that perfect ""Oscar moment.""  It is quiet, unassuming and sturdy.  Hence, it is not very moving, and the climax (due in part to what has happened to Kearns and his family) is anti-climactic.  I suspect a lot of viewers (teenagers, for example) would be bored to death.  However, an adult audience looking for very solid, professional storytelling will be well-rewarded by FLASH OF GENIUS...a movie that promises to follow a predictable path, but takes some surprising turns.",4,Another solid job from Greg Kinnear in this very interesting and well-done film.,1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,4497,"['Something', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'intermittent', 'windshield', 'wiper', 'marvel', 'engineering', 'always', 'took', 'granted', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'simple', 'idea', '50s', 'major', 'American', 'car', 'manufacturers', 'were', 'racing', 'unsuccessfully', 'create', 'one', 'kind', 'wiper', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'was', 'not', 'question', 'how', 'make', 'one', 'worked', 'was', 'insurmountable', 'challenge.Until', 'physics', 'teacher', 'named', 'Bob', 'Kearns', 'invented', 'happy', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'sold', 'device', 'Ford', 'GM', 'made', 'big', 'chunk', 'change', 'up', 'front', 'been', 'written', 'up', 'magazines', 'then', 'received', 'nice', 'royalty', 'one', 'sold.Instead', 'Kearns', 'decided', 'HE', 'wanted', 'manufacture', 'sell', 'car', 'dealers', 'was', 'NOT', 'acceptable', 'car', 'companies', 'understandably', 'how', 'could', 'trust', 'important', 'device', 'man', 'experience', 'mass', 'production', 'So', 'rather', 'continue', 'negotiate', 'stole', 'Kearns', 'idea', 'Kearns', 'spent', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'trying', 'get', 'day', 'court', 'get', 'money', 'get', 'vindication', 'recognition.That', 'nutshell', 'basic', 'framework', 'FLASH', 'OF', 'GENIUS', 'story', 'Bob', 'Kearns', 'battle', 'big', 'auto', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'basic', 'story', 'going', 'take', 'Kearns', 'will', 'face', 'struggles', 'family', 'life', 'will', 'suffer', 'will', 'suffer', 'financially', 'will', 'emerge', 'triumphant', 'victorious', 'end', 'FLASH', 'OF', 'GENIUS', 'genre', 'films', 'closely', 'related', 'sports', 'movies', 'underdog', 'ultimately', 'true', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'details', 'what', 'film', 'hypothesized', 'extrapolated', 'what', 'literally', 'happened', 'fact', 'true', 'story', 'have', 'more', 'share', 'unexpected', 'bumps', 'road', 'MANY', 'bumps', 'are', 'caused', 'Kearns', 'himself.As', 'played', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Bob', 'Kearns', 'affable', 'slightly', 'nerdy', 'nice', 'guy', 'can', 'anyone', 'do', 'affable', 'better', 'Kinnear', 'days', 'smart', 'man', 'burning', 'desire', 'teach', 'joys', 'science', 'burning', 'desire', 'make', 'fortune', 'power', 'own', 'inventiveness', 'are', 'GOOD', 'things', 'more', 'less', 'soon', 'learn', 'Kearns', 'also', 'unreasonably', 'stubborn', 'man', 'question', 'Kearns', 'was', 'frankly', 'screwed', 'car', 'companies', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'Kearns', 'own', 'stubbornness', 'unwillingness', 'compromise', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'lot', 'favors.Kearns', 'beautiful', 'loving', 'family', 'headed', 'up', 'strong', 'sensible', 'wife', 'Phyllis', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'looking', 'acting', 'JUST', 'right', 'time', 'period', 'opportunities', 'settle', 'chances', 'move', 'grace', 'Kearns', 'clings', 'beliefs', 'even', 'family', 'pushed', 'away.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'say', 'lot', 'more', 'how', 'story', 'out', 'suffice', 'say', 'FLASH', 'OF', 'GENIUS', 'least', 'half', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'slowly', 'madness', 'Not', 'put', 'straightjacket', 'give', 'electroshock', 'kind', 'movie', 'insanity', 'more', 'subtle', 'chilling', 'kind.Kinnear', 'outstanding', 'work', 'yet', 'again', 'funny', 'years', 'keep', 'expecting', 'stink', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'smarmy', 'host', 'Talk', 'Soup', 'Even', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'great', 'performances', 'LITTLE', 'MISS', 'SUNSHINE', 'AUTO', 'FOCUS', 'more', 'surprising', 'be', 'honest', 'hardly', 'act', 'just', 'guys', 'clearly', 'selective', 'work', 'do', 'generally', 'what', 'good', 'VERY', 'good', 'nice', 'chemistry', 'Graham', 'kids', 'just', 'very', 'solid', 'performance', 'entire', 'film', 'are', 'nice', 'supporting', 'performances', 'good', 'cast', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'spring', 'mind', 'everyone', 'good', 'art', 'direction', 'costumes', 'are', 'spot', 'on.Honestly', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'film', 'scope', 'little', 'story', 'told', 'easygoing', 'style', 'not', 'trying', 'say', 'anything', 'global', 'scope', 'flashy', 'scenes', 'perfect', 'Oscar', 'moment', 'quiet', 'unassuming', 'sturdy', 'Hence', 'not', 'very', 'moving', 'climax', 'due', 'part', 'what', 'happened', 'Kearns', 'family', 'anti-climactic', 'suspect', 'lot', 'viewers', 'teenagers', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'bored', 'death', 'However', 'adult', 'audience', 'looking', 'very', 'solid', 'professional', 'storytelling', 'will', 'be', 'well-rewarded', 'FLASH', 'OF', 'GENIUS', 'movie', 'follow', 'predictable', 'path', 'surprising', 'turns']",N/A

1158781,A387BD735MI50R,B00188KD2I,R. Schultz,"[1, 1]","In this case, the movie promos might have truly said ""Kinnear IS Kearns."" Greg Kinnear turns in a wonderfully nuanced performance in the role of Robert Kearns, the man who battled the Ford Motor establishment in order to gain recognition as the rightful inventor of the intermittent windshield wiper. He shows himself to be both heroic and stubborn - a good family man and frustratingly oblivious to those closest to him - intelligent and obtuse. All this at once. Kinnear embodies all these contradictions, without appearing to ""act.""Then the scenes used to dramatize Kearns' struggle are well chosen. His legal embroilment spanned more than a decade. Only a small fraction of his confrontations could be dramatized. But the film doesn't feel episodic. The years interlock neatly, without giving the viewer a sense of being yanked abruptly from one incident to another.Nevertheless, the DVD was somewhat difficult to watch on my TV. For some reason, possibly to achieve some arty chiaroscuro effect, a lot of the action must have been shot through heavy ocher filters. Most of the time, the main characters' faces appear indistinct, half eclipsed in deep shadow against almost totally blackened backgrounds. In scenes where there are groups of onlookers, such as the jury listening to Kearns plead his own patent case in court - the faces of these jurors come across as slightly smudged, glowing thumbprints.Actually, this sort of obscurantism has become common in films. But ""Flash of Genius"" presents a particularly irritating use of the technique, because it isn't a thriller or a mystery calling for some menace to be only half-seen, only guessed at as it creeps up on its victims. It makes a viewer wish for the bygone days of film, starting with the silent era when people's faces were defined in sharp, revealing black-and-white - and proceeding through the days of vivid, lucid Technicolor. Why can't we have such visibility now?The movie is worth the eyestrain though. It includes a somewhat sober Director's commentary and some extras such as a brief glimpse of Kearns' original schematics.Then there's one more thing. There's a stunning, undoubtedly unintentional irony that crops up in an early scene. We see Kearns giving an introductory lecture to his engineering students on the subject of ethics. He points out that their engineering knowledge can be used for good - as it was with the invention of the artificial heart by a noted surgeon. Or it can be used for ill - as it with the construction of gas chambers.In citing a noted surgeon as the exclusive inventor of the artificial heart, the scriptwriters unwittingly had Kearns side with the establishment in one of the most controversial patent fights on record. The on-going debate is a classic case of the little guy versus a preeminent authority in a field. The noted surgeon being referred to was obviously Robert Jarvik. However, many people now champion Paul Winchell, known primarily as being a ventriloquist for children's audiences, as having prior patent rights to the artificial heart prototype. There's tragedy and heartbreak enough to go around in this parallel case of an outsider struggling to gain recognition in the face of someone from a large, established consortium.But all that is another movie. The drama in this movie is sufficient to engage viewers' hearts and minds.",4,"Touching Performances, with a Touch of Irony",1239148800,"04 8, 2009",2009,3361,"['case', 'movie', 'promos', 'might', 'have', 'truly', 'said', 'Kinnear', 'IS', 'Kearns', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'wonderfully', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'role', 'Robert', 'Kearns', 'man', 'who', 'battled', 'Ford', 'Motor', 'establishment', 'order', 'gain', 'recognition', 'rightful', 'inventor', 'intermittent', 'windshield', 'wiper', 'be', 'heroic', 'stubborn', 'good', 'family', 'man', 'frustratingly', 'oblivious', 'closest', 'intelligent', 'obtuse', 'once', 'Kinnear', 'embodies', 'contradictions', 'appearing', 'act', 'Then', 'scenes', 'used', 'dramatize', 'Kearns', 'struggle', 'are', 'well', 'chosen', 'legal', 'embroilment', 'spanned', 'more', 'decade', 'Only', 'small', 'fraction', 'confrontations', 'could', 'be', 'dramatized', 'film', ""n't"", 'feel', 'episodic', 'years', 'interlock', 'neatly', 'giving', 'viewer', 'sense', 'being', 'yanked', 'abruptly', 'one', 'incident', 'another.Nevertheless', 'DVD', 'was', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'watch', 'TV', 'reason', 'possibly', 'achieve', 'arty', 'chiaroscuro', 'effect', 'lot', 'action', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'heavy', 'ocher', 'filters', 'Most', 'time', 'main', 'characters', 'appear', 'indistinct', 'half', 'eclipsed', 'deep', 'shadow', 'almost', 'totally', 'blackened', 'backgrounds', 'scenes', 'where', 'are', 'groups', 'onlookers', 'such', 'jury', 'listening', 'Kearns', 'plead', 'own', 'patent', 'case', 'court', 'jurors', 'come', 'slightly', 'smudged', 'glowing', 'thumbprints.Actually', 'sort', 'obscurantism', 'become', 'common', 'films', 'Flash', 'Genius', 'particularly', 'irritating', 'use', 'technique', ""n't"", 'thriller', 'mystery', 'calling', 'menace', 'be', 'only', 'half-seen', 'only', 'guessed', 'up', 'victims', 'viewer', 'wish', 'bygone', 'days', 'film', 'starting', 'silent', 'era', 'when', 'people', 'were', 'defined', 'sharp', 'revealing', 'black-and-white', 'proceeding', 'days', 'vivid', 'lucid', 'Technicolor', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'such', 'visibility', 'now', 'movie', 'eyestrain', 'somewhat', 'sober', 'Director', 'commentary', 'extras', 'such', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'Kearns', 'original', 'schematics.Then', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'stunning', 'undoubtedly', 'unintentional', 'irony', 'up', 'early', 'scene', 'see', 'Kearns', 'giving', 'introductory', 'lecture', 'engineering', 'students', 'subject', 'ethics', 'out', 'engineering', 'knowledge', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'good', 'was', 'invention', 'artificial', 'heart', 'noted', 'surgeon', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'ill', 'construction', 'gas', 'chambers.In', 'citing', 'noted', 'surgeon', 'exclusive', 'inventor', 'artificial', 'heart', 'scriptwriters', 'unwittingly', 'had', 'Kearns', 'side', 'establishment', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'patent', 'fights', 'record', 'on-going', 'debate', 'classic', 'case', 'little', 'guy', 'preeminent', 'authority', 'field', 'noted', 'surgeon', 'being', 'referred', 'was', 'obviously', 'Robert', 'Jarvik', 'However', 'many', 'people', 'now', 'champion', 'Paul', 'Winchell', 'known', 'primarily', 'being', 'ventriloquist', 'children', 'audiences', 'having', 'prior', 'patent', 'rights', 'artificial', 'heart', 'prototype', 'tragedy', 'heartbreak', 'enough', 'go', 'around', 'parallel', 'case', 'outsider', 'struggling', 'gain', 'recognition', 'face', 'someone', 'large', 'established', 'consortium.But', 'movie', 'drama', 'movie', 'sufficient', 'engage', 'viewers', 'hearts', 'minds']",N/A

1158783,A4JHEO7H330AF,B00188KD2I,Tom Brody,"[2, 3]","FLASH OF GENIUS starring Greg Kinnear, with the affable Alan Alda as one of his lawyers, concerns the man who invented the intermittent windshield wiper and his legal battle against various auto manufacturers who misappropriated his invention and infringed his patents.  This is a true story.  Finally, America is treated to another movie on patent law.  It has been many years since America first saw, THE STORY OF ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL (1939) starring Don Ameche and Henry Fonda.In a nutshell, Robert W. Kearns, a university professor, invented the intermittent wiper at home.  He secured many patents, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,494,059 issued Jan. 1985, 4,544,870 issued Oct. 1985, 4,339,698 issued July 1982, and 4,531,066 issued July 1985.  Unfortunately, while trying to gain funding for a start-up company, he showed his device to Ford Motor Co., who misappropriated his invention, and put it in their automobiles.Although Mr. Kearns secured the help of various lawyers, he is distinguished by his efforts at representing himself in court.  In the film, Greg Kinnear's high point in court is his argument that his invention, which consists of old parts being put together in a new arrangement, is like Dickens' book TALE OF TWO CITIES consisting of old, established words being put together in a new way.  (I might comment that Greg Kinnear's charming analogy confuses patent law with copyright law.)The personal interest angle of this film arises from the mess that Mr. Kearns made of his family, due to his loss of job, and infatuation with his lawsuits.  What is striking and dramatic about the story of Mr. Kearns, is that he prevailed in some of his lawsuits, despite that he was representing himself (""pro se""), and despite the fact that the lawsuits were heard in a court in the company town (Detroit).  According to real newspaper articles, Mr. Kearns won settlements of around $30 million.  It might be argued that Mr. Kearns might have messed up his life, or that Mr. Kearns did something unusual, by spending so much time in law suits.  On the other hand, other inventors such as Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, and Nicola Tesla also spent huge quantities of time with their patent lawsuits.TAKE-HOME LESSON #1.  This movie provides a couple of take-home lessons.  The layperson will be struck by the notion that Mr. Kearns was pursuing what was ethically right, namely, achieving recognition for being the inventor of the intermittent wiper.  The movie makes clear that his primary goal was not to earn lots of money.  However, Mr. Kearns failed to realize that the primary purpose of the U.S. patent system is to stimulate commercial development, and NOT TO REWARD THE INVENTOR.  This fact is made clear in Edward Walterscheid's excellent book, TO PROMOTE THE PROGRESS OF USEFUL ARTS:AMERICAN PATENT LAW AND ADMINISTRATION 1787-1836.  Thus, Mr. Kearns was wrong in being fixated on the notion that he had a right to be recognized as ""the inventor"" of the intermittent wiper.TAKE-HOME LESSON #2.  Much of the movie concerns the deterioration of Mr. Kearns' commitment to his university responsibilities, and to his family responsibilities, due to his focus on lawsuits.  But this sort of thing is not unusual.  Plenty of families break up because the husband or wife are overly committed to their job.  (An example might be President Ronald Reagan's divorce, apparently arising from the fact that his first wife had no interest in politics.)  But the unique take-home lesson in this movie is Mr. Kearns' notion that he should argue his own cases in court.  Shown below are some quotes from opinions from the Federal Circuit, an appeals court in Washington D.C. devoted to patent cases.  From these opinions, it can be seen that the judges at the Federal Circuit found Mr. Kearns to be disgusting.  The first quote discloses that he had been representing himself (""pro se"").  The second quote discloses that he was abusing the court system.  In other words, in the U.S. court system, plaintiffs are permitted to represent themselves, but in a complex patent case, a plaintiff who tries to do this will invariably make a garbled mess of their own cause and waste the time of all those concerned:""This matter stems from Kearns' longstanding battle with the automobile manufacturing industry concerning the infringement of the claims of Kearns' patents relating to electronic intermittent windshield wiper systems. Kearns has been represented by various law firms over the last 13 years. As of March 1992, Kearns has been proceeding pro se."" (Federal Circuit, Dec. 30, 1992)""Without question, Dr. Kearns' refusal to obey the court orders prejudiced GM. GM could not reasonably prepare a defense to the infringement charges until it knew exactly which claims Dr. Kearns would assert. Throughout the proceedings Dr. Kearns refused to accept that he could only assert patents listed in his complaint. Moreover, Dr. Kearns refused to comply with the district court's order to limit his case to one representative claim per patent. There are 51 claims in the five patents listed in the complaint and 232 total claims in all of Dr. Kearns' patents . . .  Dr. Kearns sought, despite clear orders to the contrary, to assert every claim of every patent he owned. Thus, he knowingly ignored the district court's reasonable order seeking to simplify a highly complex case . . .  I'm going to dismiss this case. My patience is at an end. My judicial patience is at an end. Dr. Kearns has had more than ample time in which to designate the claims . . . Dr. Kearns is in complete default. A patent case cannot go forward without the claims-in-suit, the asserted claims being designated . . . The complete transcript of that hearing shows that the trial court considered the alternative of designating the claims on its own, but decided that dismissal was more appropriate in light of Kearns' repeated refusals to obey pretrial orders . . . There is a vast difference between a pro se plaintiff with a meritorious case unable to afford counsel and a pro se plaintiff with a meritorious case declining to employ counsel because of a misplaced lack of trust in lawyers or an inflated opinion notion of his ability to prosecute his own case.

1158786,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00188KD2I,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","""Flash of Genius"" is a poignant and inspiring David vs Goliath story - Greg Kinnear [who gets better with each screen performance] plays Dr Robert Kearns who leads a normal family life [a gaggle of kids and a wife played by Lauren Graham] and lectures in a college. His life changes when he invents the intermittent windshield wiper, a mechanism that allows drivers to control the interval between the swishing of the blades on a windshield wiper. Together with a long-time friend [Dermot Mulroney], Kearns patents his invention and tries to get the Ford Motor Company interested in his invention but fails to get a contract with them. When he later finds that Ford has installed the intermittent wipers on their cars, he decides to take the company to court, but finds that it is a Herculean task that exacts a heavy toll on him, costing years of his life.The story unfolds at the right pace and the drama of a lone man's battle against a giant corporation is compellingly portrayed, strengthened by Greg Kinnear's passionate and earnest performance [one of his best]. Lauren Graham is average as Kearn's long-suffering wife [her character did not get much development, partly because the central focus was Kinnear's role]. The rest of the cast were credible in their roles, although Alan Alda's brief appearance as a shrewd and calculating attorney was note-worthy.""Flash of Genius"" may not be an action-packed potboiler but it is no less riveting for it effectively captures Kearns' lone struggle for truth and recognition. He turns down lucrative monetary settlements out of court because he is a man of principle - what he wants is for a large corporation [in this case Ford] to acknowledge they did him wrong by stealing his idea, and for this truth, he risks everything - his marriage, family, and career.
