1276461,A2266IZWO64EE3,B002LH42H2,AL,"[6, 6]","This is one of the most underrated comedies of the 30s. Errol Flynn on top of his form, gorgeous, charming and funny. His comic timing is perfect, he could be as a great as Cary Grant or Gary Cooper, if he would be given a chance to play more roles like this. Olivia de Havilland is great also. Solid supporting cast, cheek-to-tongue dialog, quick pace. Be warned, though, that DVD is bare bones: no extras, no captions, no scene selection even.",4,90 minutes of pure fun,1274054400,"05 17, 2010",2010,445,"['one', 'most', 'underrated', 'comedies', '30s', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'top', 'form', 'gorgeous', 'charming', 'funny', 'comic', 'timing', 'perfect', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'would', 'be', 'given', 'chance', 'play', 'more', 'roles', 'Olivia', 'Havilland', 'great', 'also', 'Solid', 'supporting', 'cast', 'cheek-to-tongue', 'dialog', 'quick', 'pace', 'Be', 'warned', 'DVD', 'bare', 'bones', 'extras', 'captions', 'scene', 'selection', 'even']",Four's a Crowd

1276463,A142ILZSESCSSB,B002LH42H2,Kate,"[4, 4]","This movie has been long waiting for any Olivia and Errol fans. It is a shame these two did not do more comedy together. They are really fun to watch. The movie is typical 30's screwball comedy, so popular at that time. it is fast paced and witty humor though out. What i don't like is there are no extras of the making of it, and Warners did not take the time or care to restore this film as much as others like ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"". Still this is very much worth watching. Olivia and Errol out of  their usual costume dramas, and into something contemporary for its time.I highly recommend it. Also look for the little terrier in the movie. It is the same dog who played Asta in all the old Thin Man Movies, Bringing up Baby and many more",4,change of pace,1274054400,"05 17, 2010",2010,750,"['movie', 'been', 'long', 'waiting', 'Olivia', 'Errol', 'fans', 'shame', 'two', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'more', 'comedy', 'together', 'are', 'really', 'fun', 'watch', 'movie', 'typical', '30', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'popular', 'time', 'fast', 'paced', 'witty', 'humor', 'out', 'What', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'are', 'extras', 'making', 'Warners', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'time', 'care', 'restore', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'others', 'Adventures', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Still', 'very', 'much', 'worth', 'watching', 'Olivia', 'Errol', 'usual', 'costume', 'dramas', 'something', 'contemporary', 'time.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Also', 'look', 'little', 'terrier', 'movie', 'same', 'dog', 'who', 'played', 'Asta', 'old', 'Thin', 'Man', 'Movies', 'Bringing', 'up', 'Baby', 'many', 'more']",Four's a Crowd

Errol's timing is wonderful as a publicist who falls for his most difficult client's daughter but it's a shame he was typecast away from this kind of film.  In the vein of ""The Thin Man"".  Directed by Micheal Curtiz, star-studded plus strong supporting roles with Franklin Pangborn and that wicked witch, Margaret Hamilton.  Reviews then and to a certain extent, even now, aren't favorable but I disagree.
