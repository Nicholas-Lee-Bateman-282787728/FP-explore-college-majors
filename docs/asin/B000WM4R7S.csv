1110227,A1EZMV5DSWU8TU,B000WM4R7S,Draconis Blackthorne,"[1, 1]","An aspiring mother makes a pact with The Devil for wealth in exchange for her daughter, who would one day marry Satan's son. She despicably tries to renege on the deal, and is promptly punished for her ingratitude. In an attempt to shoot The Devil, the bullet actually penetrates her own chest. Her daughter 'Diane' {Belinda Montgomery} grows up sheltered in convents and private schools, eventually developing into quite a comely young lady until the day of her mother's funeral, where she meets with Lilith Malone {Shelley Winters}, who graciously offers her to stay at her beautiful home, wherein she begins experiencing nightmares and comes upon little secrets here and there, and her suspicion grows. She becomes fascinated by a certain sigil which she notices being virtually omnipresent at the mansion, on objects, and on jewelry upon suspicious persons, including two rather feather-brained women who act like something out of The Stepford Wives.Upon meeting a new friend Alice Shaw {Diane Ladd}, she decides to be out on her own, and leaves the comfort of this veritable palace for an apartment. Here and there, Lilith and her cohorts begin appearing, monitoring her. Jonathan Frid {of Barnabas Collins / 'Dark Shadows' fame} plays a mute butler / limousine driver, who seems to feel for the young lady's perceived plight, when all she had to do all along is merely accept her birthright as the ""Princess of Darkness'.One night while at a party thrown by Lilith, Diane drinks a bit too much wherein her repressed carnal expression breaks free and begins lasciviously dancing in the midst of the crowd, who begin hailing her as the said 'Princess of Darkness', as well as 'The Demon of Endor'. Her denial persists, despite her increasing experiences with her own diabolical powers made manifest. She is summoned by a Judge who informs her that her father set up a trust fund for her; who pleasantly agrees to 'give her away' at her impending whirlwind romance and wedding. I thought it rather interesting that she began dating her now dead friend's man, who perished in a freak horse 'accident' {seems that during one of Lilith's unexpected visits, she stealthily lifted a horse figurine from Alice's collection, obviously using it for a Curse}. She meets Steve Stone {Robert Foxworth} and falls horns over hoofs in love. We later come to discover that she meets her true ""soul-mate"" in his form.Many surprises await the viewer at the end during The Wedding with a truly delightful twist.The Devil's Daughter was released around the same time as all the legendary 'devil movies' such as The Devil's Rain, Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, and later, The Omen were, which also includes an 'all-star' cast, and otherwise served to launch the career of subsequent stars.

1110231,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,B000WM4R7S,Simon Davis,"[25, 27]","The huge success of 1968's ""Rosemary's Baby"", starring a beleagured Mia Farrow as a young bride who has a child to the Devil, was responsible for spawning a whole new and highly popular genre in ""Satan/Occult/Devil Worship themed movies. Culminating in 1972's Box Office champ ""The Exorcist"", television wisely saw the value of also following this current trend of anything to do with the Devil and began producing similiar themed movies for television. Often these stories featured unsuspecting women having children either to the Devil or possessing supernatural powers as seen in Barbara Eden's chilling ""The Stranger Within"", in 1972. This particular entry in the field, 1973's ""The Devil's Daughter"", starring Belinda Montgomery in the title role took a slightly different slant in its story telling dealing instead with a young woman who is promised to the Devil by her sect member Mother when she reaches the age of 21 with ultimately tragic consequences. The overall approach of this television movie could be regarded as standard for this period however it is the first rate cast including a scene stealing and ideally cast Shelley Winters, plus some highly effective camera work culminating in an incredibly eerie finale which makes ""The Devil's Daughter"", first rate viewing for fans of this genre that saw its peak in the early 1970's.Dismissed most likely nowadays as simply another clone in the endless cycle of ""Demon Features"", that flooded television in the early 1970's in the wake of its similiar themed big screen releases, that I feel is an unfair assumption to make of ""The Devil's Daughter"". Despite being produced on what would have been a typical television movie budget for the time it nevertheless boasts a first rate cast of seasoned veterans such as Shelley Winters, Joseph Cotton, Jonathan Frid from ""Dark Shadows"", and Lucille Benson alongside talented newcomers such as Belinda Montgomery and Robert Foxworth. This film is a classic illustration of the calibre of talent that was commonplace on what were titled ""Movies of the Week"", back in the 1970's. Belinda Montgomery playing the title character of Diane was a very popular and talented young performer in the 1970's and she was the perfect choice to play the sweet and innocent young girl who unexpectedly finds herself pursued by a group of Devil worshippers who have her marked as the future bride of Satan. It is however the veteran performers that steal every scene they appear in and who importantly bring the real sense of menace into the storyline. Shelley Winters playing the role of Lilith Malone was no stranger to this genre and she took on this role just after her Oscar nominated performance in ""The Poseidon Adventure"", and in the superb horror story ""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?"" which she made in England. Shelley I feel is the best part of the story playing a larger than life member of the Demon worshipping sect who lures the unsuspecting Diane into her home and ""prepares"" her unknowingly for her future role as Satan's bride. She is pure ""Old Hollywood"", in her playing which makes her performance so memorable and very enjoyable made up as it is of equal portions humour, eccentricity and horror.  Joseph Cotton, a seasoned Hollywood veteran with a string of memorable Hollywood classics to his credit was also no stranger in 1973 to the horror genre having just completed the brilliant ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes"", with Vincent Price. Despite appearing quite frail here Cotten has perhaps the most surprising and ultimately disturbing role of all in ""The Devil's Daughter"", as the kindly lawyer handling Diane's finances who as events reveal, is not exactly the genteel individual he first appears to be. Lucille Benson and Thelma Carpenter as the rather odd ""sisters"" who live next door to Lilith and are also part of the Devil Worshipping sect are a total hoot in their scenes and the fact that it is never explained how these two women, one white and one black, ever came to be sisters makes them seem even more comical despite them being in on the plan to capture Diane for her new ""husband"". Robert Foxworth who is probably still best remembered for his long running role on the series ""Falcon Crest"", follows the trend of the other male characters in the story who always seem to turn out to be not quite who you think they are. Foxworth plays a very eerie central role in the quite stunning finale to the film which even now, over 36 years later, still packs a frightening punch with its very surpirisng and macabre final twist.While I personally am thrilled to finally see some of these interesting and well made 1970's Television movies making their way onto DVD, in the case of ""The Devil's Daughter"" a lot more care and effort could have been expended by Paramount Television when readying it for its DVD release. While the film has been restored back to its original correct running time there are no additional features, commentaries etc and the picture quality in many instances leaves a lot to be desired. The often superb camera work employed by Director Jeannot Szwarc that was designed to build tension and take great advantage of the locations used often has its eerie effect lessened by the non remastered and jumpy print that really needs a thorough restoration. Nevertheless I found my recent viewing of ""The Devil's Daughter"" to be not only a wonderful nostalgic viewing experience but also in a way a sad reflection on our current television industry that doesn't seem capable of producing many original stories for television like the old ABC ""Movies of the Week"", were capable of doing. For a trip back to the early 1970's when Satan and the Occult were the hottest ratings winners around, try and seek out the new DVD release of Belinda Montgomery fighting off the Satanists in the aptly titled ""The Devil's Daughter"".
