This sounded delicious, and about a period of time and artists with whom I am not as familiar as I'd like to be (with obvious exceptions of Pollack, DeKoonig, etc).  I even read the whole zillion page tome which is the biography of Pollack.But quality-wise this movie is at best a senior year film project.  There is often but by no means always the name given of the various speakers but even then only once, written beneath them, at the very first clip, and they get interviewed over and over, many of them, so if you don't recognize them and if you happen to miss or forget that early quick label, for most of the movie you have people talking about things with no idea who they are.  So while you are listening to one of the many middle aged men (almost all men) talking about why the little line in the middle formed a shape which made the shape the subject and on and on, you don't even know who this is without going back and hunting from the beginning.And there is no decent interviewer here.  This is most maddening for me in the ""interview"" or just talk among a man (interviewer?), a woman whose back is always to us, and Jaspar Johns.  They just let him ramble, never really go back and force answers to anything, like everyone on camera is stoned and you're not.And there was seemingly no structure.  One guy talking, then another guy talking about abstract concepts if concepts at all and not necessarily any paintings to go with what is being said.  Not often enough did I feel the film illustrated what was even being discussed (did do this well with Newman).  And as someone else pointed out, you won't see painters painting here.And le pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance for me in terms of my student film project theory is that the sound even goes dim for a while and comes back.  Maybe a product of the age of the tape?  Who knows.  Wouldn't surprise me if in the original.As a chance to see old and no doubt rare footage of big 20th century American artist names, this is worth its existence, and for this it gets my 2 starts rather than just one.  Otherwise, a total waste of someone's camera. (And all that without even entering the discussion of the worth of some of these works -- I happen to like DeKoonig, but some others were surely cons, if not the first time, then at least by the 10th version of the same gimmick)",2,old student film project?,1348012800,"09 19, 2012",2012,2407,"['movie', 'book', 'artists', 'usually', 'eat', 'right', 'up', 'sounded', 'delicious', 'period', 'time', 'artists', 'whom', 'am', 'not', 'as', 'familiar', ""'d"", 'like', 'be', 'obvious', 'exceptions', 'Pollack', 'DeKoonig', 'etc', 'even', 'read', 'whole', 'zillion', 'page', 'tome', 'biography', 'Pollack.But', 'quality-wise', 'movie', 'best', 'senior', 'year', 'film', 'project', 'often', 'means', 'always', 'name', 'given', 'various', 'speakers', 'even', 'then', 'only', 'once', 'written', 'very', 'first', 'clip', 'get', 'interviewed', 'many', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'happen', 'miss', 'forget', 'early', 'quick', 'label', 'most', 'movie', 'have', 'people', 'talking', 'things', 'idea', 'who', 'are', 'So', 'are', 'listening', 'one', 'many', 'middle', 'aged', 'men', 'almost', 'men', 'talking', 'why', 'little', 'line', 'middle', 'formed', 'shape', 'made', 'shape', 'subject', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'who', 'going', 'back', 'hunting', 'beginning.And', 'decent', 'interviewer', 'here', 'most', 'maddening', 'interview', 'just', 'talk', 'man', 'interviewer', 'woman', 'back', 'always', 'Jaspar', 'Johns', 'just', 'let', 'ramble', 'never', 'really', 'go', 'back', 'force', 'answers', 'anything', 'everyone', 'camera', 'stoned', ""'re"", 'was', 'seemingly', 'structure', 'One', 'guy', 'talking', 'then', 'guy', 'talking', 'abstract', 'concepts', 'concepts', 'not', 'necessarily', 'paintings', 'go', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'Not', 'often', 'enough', 'did', 'feel', 'film', 'illustrated', 'what', 'was', 'even', 'being', 'discussed', 'did', 'do', 'well', 'Newman', 'someone', 'else', 'pointed', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'painters', 'painting', 'here.And', 'le', 'pi', 'egrave', 'ce', 'r', 'eacute', 'sistance', 'terms', 'student', 'film', 'project', 'theory', 'sound', 'even', 'dim', 'while', 'back', 'Maybe', 'product', 'age', 'tape', 'Who', 'Would', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'original.As', 'chance', 'see', 'old', 'doubt', 'rare', 'footage', 'big', '20th', 'century', 'American', 'artist', 'names', 'worth', 'existence', '2', 'rather', 'just', 'one', 'Otherwise', 'total', 'waste', 'someone', 'camera', 'even', 'entering', 'discussion', 'worth', 'works', 'happen', 'like', 'DeKoonig', 'others', 'were', 'surely', 'cons', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'then', 'least', '10th', 'version', 'same', 'gimmick']",N/A

344174,A24Q40NN7O07GK,6302889650,Jon Morris,"[11, 11]","Emile de Antonio's documentary of the New York art scene from 1940-1970 is a masterpiece in itself, equal to the works of art put on canvas by the artists interviewed. It is a time capsule, captured on film, of a bygone era. The effects of Jackson Pollock's work and the aftermath of the 1960's factory scene and it's effects on the world and culture of American art are discussed. Legends of the cubist/neo-dada/pop art movements like Andy Warhol, Willem de Kooning, Kenneth Noland, Robert Rauschenberg, Helen Frankenthaler, Jasper Johns, and Frank Stella are interviewed among many others and their art analyzed with great attention to preserving their individual flavors and not allowing the editing process to dilute their unique contributions and bleed them together. You really get a sense of what makes each individual artist tick and what inspires them to create what would later become near-priceless works of art in just under a half-century.To be honest, I didn't even know the film existed until a year or so ago and was delighted to find it on DVD here at Amazon. I ordered it and watched and was blown away. It is much different hearing the artists talk about their own work on film as opposed to reading about them. You get a more intimate portrait of the artists themselves and it is a DVD I will treasure forever. As a bonus treat, there is a very interesting PBS interview included on the DVD of Emile de Antonio filmed shortly before his death in 1989 included on the bonus section of the DVD where he discusses what went into the creation of the documentary and about his relationships with the various artists interviewed. Nearly worth the cost of the DVD by itself.Overall this is a must-buy DVD, not just for the artist or aspiring painter, but for anyone interested in the beauty of paint and canvas in general and of the New York art scene in particular.",5,A time capsule of the golden-age of the New York Art Scene,1297468800,"02 12, 2011",2011,1879,"['Emile', 'de', 'Antonio', 'documentary', 'New', 'York', 'art', 'scene', '1940-1970', 'masterpiece', 'equal', 'works', 'art', 'put', 'canvas', 'artists', 'interviewed', 'time', 'capsule', 'captured', 'film', 'bygone', 'era', 'effects', 'Jackson', 'Pollock', 'work', 'aftermath', '1960', 'factory', 'scene', 'effects', 'world', 'culture', 'American', 'art', 'are', 'discussed', 'Legends', 'cubist/neo-dada/pop', 'art', 'movements', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'Willem', 'Kooning', 'Kenneth', 'Noland', 'Robert', 'Rauschenberg', 'Helen', 'Frankenthaler', 'Jasper', 'Johns', 'Frank', 'Stella', 'are', 'interviewed', 'many', 'others', 'art', 'analyzed', 'great', 'attention', 'preserving', 'individual', 'flavors', 'not', 'allowing', 'editing', 'process', 'dilute', 'unique', 'contributions', 'bleed', 'together', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'what', 'individual', 'artist', 'tick', 'what', 'create', 'what', 'would', 'later', 'become', 'near-priceless', 'works', 'art', 'just', 'half-century.To', 'be', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'film', 'existed', 'year', 'so', 'ago', 'was', 'delighted', 'find', 'DVD', 'here', 'Amazon', 'ordered', 'watched', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'much', 'different', 'hearing', 'artists', 'talk', 'own', 'work', 'film', 'opposed', 'reading', 'get', 'more', 'intimate', 'portrait', 'artists', 'DVD', 'will', 'treasure', 'forever', 'bonus', 'treat', 'very', 'interesting', 'PBS', 'interview', 'included', 'DVD', 'Emile', 'de', 'Antonio', 'filmed', 'shortly', 'death', '1989', 'included', 'bonus', 'section', 'DVD', 'where', 'what', 'went', 'creation', 'documentary', 'relationships', 'various', 'artists', 'interviewed', 'Nearly', 'cost', 'DVD', 'itself.Overall', 'must-buy', 'DVD', 'not', 'just', 'artist', 'aspiring', 'painter', 'anyone', 'interested', 'beauty', 'paint', 'canvas', 'general', 'New', 'York', 'art', 'scene', 'particular']",N/A
