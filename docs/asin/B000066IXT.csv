It had a lot of memorable characters, good action and a pretty decent story.This is not an original Escaflowne. It does not take part before or after the series. It doesn't take place somewhere in the middle. It takes most of the main characters from the series and totally retells the entire story to fit into a movie. The result? Not a fan. Basically, because the entire movie you see a 30 second introduction to old characters in suped up animation with no depth. For example, the twin cat girls that were so fond Lord Falcon, show up instead for a brief 30 seconds as singers on stage in a bar. Ummm yuck. Lots of the more memorable characters are subjugated to this. Perhaps, if you seen this first it would be a decent watch. For myself, I was very disappointed.The good points of this movie is the animation is upgraded and the soundtrack is well done.Even as a standalone product, the movie has no flow or depth to it. It's basically just a compressed retelling of Escaflowne. I'd rent this and skip it as a purchase. If you want to purchase something, get the Escaflowne series.

The movie basically compacts the entire television series into a 2 1/2 hour movie and changes the characters we've grown to love in the series to, almost seeminly, dark doplegangers.  Hitomi is suicidal and Van is a dark brooding boy who cares nothing about others, until of course he meets hitomi.  And what of escaflowne itself?

701724,A7FVX0OOEIHYZ,B000066IXT,"Bjorn ""wolf-sigma""","[72, 74]","I noticed an interesting trend in the negative reviews this Movie was getting.  By and large, people who found this movie slow or boring did not watch the original series.  Well folks...that explains it.Unlike most Anime movie tie-ins, I.E. Cowboy Bebop or Blue Gender, the Escaflowne movie is really a re-imagination of its progenitor.  While in the series the Escaflowne armor was a royal heirloom, in this it is the embodiment of destiny and a living being.  And while Hitomi was painfully innocent and upbeat in the series, here she is dark, lonely and suicidal.  Best of all, Van is equally dark and has lost the heroic stoicism for apathy and a-moralism.  All these things are so different from the series its like watching Alice in Wonderland then playing American Magee's Alice (which, if you haven't seen or played, you should).I will admit that when I first bought this DVD I too was disappointed.  The action was neat and all but the story dealt too much with ethereal Fate and Destiny, thing I really could care less about.  But then I watched the series, which brings in these subjects a little less jarringly and I found the whole idea much more edible.  And, while I was initially disgusted with the characters of this DVD, namely Hitomi and the cat girl, when I understood the origins of these characters, I loved the change.  The basic story you can get from the other reviews, I hate to give stuff away.  But while the series focused on Van's travel and growth into a warrior, the Movie focuses on the dark prophecy to which he is chained.But if you really want an endorsement from me, here it is.  Escaflowne the Movie is an awesome experience for the initiate to the series.  Escaflowne the Movie is a sub par experience for those who are bereft of the Series.  But above all else, Escaflowne the Movie is worth watching for the absolutely amazing music, which really steals the show.  If nothing else, then rent this DVD and stick in a system with surround sound.  Then turn off the TV and crank the volume...you will not be disappointed.",4,This movie does not stand alone well.,1096848000,"10 4, 2004",2004,2059,"['noticed', 'interesting', 'trend', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Movie', 'was', 'getting', 'large', 'people', 'who', 'found', 'movie', 'slow', 'boring', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'original', 'series', 'Well', 'folks', 'it.Unlike', 'most', 'Anime', 'movie', 'tie-ins', 'I.E', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'Blue', 'Gender', 'Escaflowne', 'movie', 'really', 're-imagination', 'progenitor', 'series', 'Escaflowne', 'armor', 'was', 'royal', 'heirloom', 'embodiment', 'destiny', 'living', 'being', 'Hitomi', 'was', 'painfully', 'innocent', 'upbeat', 'series', 'here', 'dark', 'lonely', 'suicidal', 'Best', 'Van', 'equally', 'dark', 'lost', 'heroic', 'stoicism', 'apathy', 'a-moralism', 'things', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'series', 'watching', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'then', 'playing', 'American', 'Magee', 'Alice', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'played', 'should', '.I', 'will', 'admit', 'when', 'first', 'bought', 'DVD', 'too', 'was', 'disappointed', 'action', 'was', 'neat', 'story', 'dealt', 'too', 'much', 'ethereal', 'Fate', 'Destiny', 'thing', 'really', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'then', 'watched', 'series', 'subjects', 'little', 'less', 'jarringly', 'found', 'whole', 'idea', 'much', 'more', 'edible', 'was', 'initially', 'disgusted', 'characters', 'DVD', 'namely', 'Hitomi', 'cat', 'girl', 'when', 'understood', 'origins', 'characters', 'loved', 'change', 'basic', 'story', 'can', 'get', 'other', 'reviews', 'hate', 'give', 'stuff', 'away', 'series', 'focused', 'Van', 'travel', 'growth', 'warrior', 'Movie', 'dark', 'prophecy', 'chained.But', 'really', 'want', 'endorsement', 'here', 'Escaflowne', 'Movie', 'awesome', 'experience', 'initiate', 'series', 'Escaflowne', 'Movie', 'sub', 'par', 'experience', 'who', 'are', 'bereft', 'Series', 'else', 'Escaflowne', 'Movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'music', 'really', 'show', 'nothing', 'else', 'then', 'rent', 'DVD', 'stick', 'system', 'surround', 'sound', 'Then', 'turn', 'off', 'TV', 'crank', 'volume', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

This movie is a re-telling of the series, not a continuation.  They took the themes and arcatypical characters, and threw them into a more primal world. Sadly this lacks the depth of the series, which kinda ruins it for me, but the movie does have some good points.  The soundtrack is absolutely stunning.  I bought the version with the sound track included because it was cheaper than paying the $40-50 for the music alone.  In fact, the soundtrack is really the only reason I got the movie. The video itself is beautiful, and will be perfect for the blue ray release coming out in spite of it not being a newer movie. The English cast is much better than the series, but still rather rough (more on the side of the scripting than the actors themselves;  perfect example is that of the ""are you the wing goddess?"" followed by someone saying ""YOU ARE THE WING GODDESS"" and poor hitomi crying ""I dont know!"").Sadly I will probably only watch this show once more when it comes out on blue-ray to see the visuals, because the story (while a good idea) is actually that bad.  I mean, you cant watch it before you watch the series as the old/cheap animation of the series will bother you after watching the movie.  But at the same time you cannot watch the movie after the series because it ruins the characters, the story, and the general romantic wonder that is Escaflowne.

Breakey,"[3, 3]","First of all, I have to point out that I am a fan of the original twenty-six episode series, which I consider to be an absolutely stunning production and story, with a slightly disjointed ending.That said, I admittedly watched this with an existing bias.As a movie in its own right, this is very nice; compared to the original series it was adapted from, it's a bit of a let down. The production standards were excellent (after all, it appears to use the same cast and crew as the original series), but to somebody who had already experienced the richness of the original, the retelling was rather abrupt.In my opinion, it is best to consider this to be an alternative history type of tale, that happens to feature many of the same characters. The storyline only bears a superficial resemblance to that of the original, but it's a decent storyline in its own right. If I had seen this before watching the series, I would probably have considered it a 4 of 5 overall.Character designs are nice, and the animation is excellent. The sound quality seems to be very good, but they don't seem to be trying for the immersive audio experience of the series. I cannot comment on the quality of the dub work (didn't listen to it) but considering the company, it's probably decent. Acting on the Japanese audio is excellent, and, if I'm recalling names correctly, features the same cast as the series. The subtitles are nicely legible, although I was watching it on a 31&quot; display using an S-Video hookup.I can't comment on the extra features available, as I've only seen a rental edition (no bonus disc included), but the extra features on the main disc are minimal.",3,"Disappointing, compared to the original series",1037232000,"11 14, 2002",2002,1660,"['First', 'have', 'point', 'out', 'am', 'fan', 'original', 'twenty-six', 'episode', 'series', 'consider', 'be', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'production', 'story', 'slightly', 'disjointed', 'ending.That', 'said', 'admittedly', 'watched', 'existing', 'bias.As', 'movie', 'own', 'right', 'very', 'nice', 'compared', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'adapted', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'production', 'standards', 'were', 'excellent', 'use', 'same', 'cast', 'crew', 'original', 'series', 'somebody', 'who', 'had', 'already', 'experienced', 'richness', 'original', 'retelling', 'was', 'rather', 'abrupt.In', 'opinion', 'best', 'consider', 'be', 'alternative', 'history', 'type', 'tale', 'feature', 'many', 'same', 'characters', 'storyline', 'only', 'superficial', 'resemblance', 'original', 'decent', 'storyline', 'own', 'right', 'had', 'seen', 'watching', 'series', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'considered', '4', '5', 'overall.Character', 'designs', 'are', 'nice', 'animation', 'excellent', 'sound', 'quality', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'trying', 'immersive', 'audio', 'experience', 'series', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'quality', 'dub', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'listen', 'considering', 'company', 'probably', 'decent', 'Acting', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'excellent', ""'m"", 'recalling', 'names', 'correctly', 'same', 'cast', 'series', 'subtitles', 'are', 'nicely', 'legible', 'was', 'watching', '31', 'quot', 'display', 'using', 'S-Video', 'hookup.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'extra', 'features', 'available', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'rental', 'edition', 'bonus', 'disc', 'included', 'extra', 'features', 'main', 'disc', 'are', 'minimal']",N/A
701729,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B000066IXT,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[6, 6]","I saw &quot;Escaflowne - The Movie&quot; without having first seen the series - and found myself completely confused at times.  The characters aren't strongly established (the assumption seems to be that viewers will know them and their relationships) and the action is often darkly animated, with pivotal moments arriving so quickly and then left behind just as abruptly, robbing the viewer of the significance.Having said the above, I still enjoyed the movie.  Hitomi, even in her two-dimensional angst portrayal, is charming.  Van is better developed; his character drives the film with his anger and loneliness.  Although the animation is a little uneven - breathtaking at times, static at others, it is well executed overall.If you purchase the ultimate edition set, you'll love the CD of the soundtrack.  The disk containing the production art gallery is less interesting.  (The art gallery pictures are difficult to make out, for one.)I recommend watching at least a few episodes of the series &quot;Escaflowne&quot; before watching this movie.

701730,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000066IXT,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[29, 32]","In 1996, the Sunrise Studios anime television series ""The Vision of Escaflowne"" aired on television and although not a tremendous hit in Japan, when the series was released on DVD in America, it became a big hit. Not just in the US but worldwide.Despite being released on Saturday morning television on Fox Kids (albeit heavily edited), the series would receive appreciation and a lot of love by fans for the Escaflowne's characters,  it's beautiful artwork and character designs, its story but most of all, it's enchanting music.With the fanfare strong worldwide, in 2000, Sunrise and Studio BONES began on a reimagining the television series through a 95-minute film titled ""Escaflowne: The Movie"".  The film version is very different from the television series as the film is much more darker and the protagonist, the happy and chirpy Hitomi is anything but that.  In fact, she's a person who is depressed and contemplates suicide. While the character of Van, is more reserved and willing to slash and kill anyone in his way.Needless to say, the film is quite different as it focuses on these two main characters but most importantly, the film is for those who are and aren't familiar with the television series and can enjoy it in the theaters.  The film received mixed reviews with diehard fans who had a hard time seeing a different version of their characters and of course, knowing that there is only so much story from the 26-episode anime series that is going to get covered in a 95 minute film.The film begins with Hitomi, sad and depressed, you learn that she is a person who wants to kill herself and is prepared to say goodbye to her best friend via a letter.  Fortunately, her friend discovers her and the letter and tries to convince her that suicide is not a good way to go.  But no matter how much she tries to cheer up Hitomi, Hitomi is resigned with herself and with life.The film then switches to the character of Van.  We see Van, who is violently slashing through many soldiers in order to find the behemoth known as Escaflowne and the Winged Goddess which he wants to use towards defeating his brother Lord Folken and his army.Meanwhile, while Hitomi is alone and wanting to end her life, she sees an image of Lord Folken who calls her the Winged Goddess and wants her to join him.  Confused and not sure what is going on, blackness starts to envelop the area and  Hitomi is immediately sucked up into darkness and  not knowing what is happening, by the time Hitomi awakes, she emerges out of Escaflowne and encounters Prince Van.Van believes her to be the Winged Goddess but immediately Escaflowne disappears and then believes that she may be a spy and a fake.  Because of her more modern school girl clothing, many of Van's friends believe she is the true Winged Goddess despite Van not believing in her and almost wanting to kill her.On the other side of the battle, we learn that Lord Folken and the Black Dragons are preparing their attack Van's crew and capture Hitomi for his goal to use the power of the Winged Goddess to destroy the world.Because of the increased attacks and attempts to capture Hitomi, Van is ordered to protect Hitomi at all costs.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Escaflowne: The Movie"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  It's important to note that the film was created in late 1999 and then released in theaters in 2000.  Also, the film was produced by Sunrise but animated by Studio BONES and for the most part, a few talented animators took part in the action sequences as well as new character designs for the film.  With that being said, when I first reviewed this film when it was first released on DVD, I commented on how gorgeous the film looked.  It's very detailed backgrounds but also the film's awesome animation.Here we are in 2009 and the film now making its HD debut and I still stand by that.  The film looks great and although it may not look as digital and clean like today's modern anime, the film still looks incredible for an anime film nearly a decade old.  But what is the primary difference between the picture quality from the DVD versus the Blu-ray?  There are several segments in the film that I tested out and that was the outdoor sequence (50-54 minutes into the film) and on Blu-ray, the first thing you will notice is how vibrant the outdoor scenes look.  The green and blues just pop out, especially during sunset with the red of the sun also popping out.  Needless to say, the film looks quite vibrant during the outdoor scenes.The print is not 100% clear of dust which I think I may have seen a few specs but overall, I didn't see a whole lot, nor did I see any major compression problems throughout the film.  Blacks are nice and dark and there is grain present.  Again, I'm a person who supports film grain and not supportive of excessive DNR (Digital Noise Reduction), so overall...I was pretty pleased with the picture quality for a film nearly 10 years old.As for the audio, this is where ""Escaflowne: The Movie"" shines.  One thing that I noticed quickly is how immersive the soundtrack was in utilizing the soundscape of each channel.  The film's dialogue is front and center channel driven but sound effects from the whisping as Van flies in the air, the clanging of the swords during battle, the blasts that are being shot and the destruction in the city is well-captured on your surround channels, especially via LFE.  I definitely enjoy when anime uses the subwoofer quite a bit, so it was great to hear that LFE usage. And of course, one thing that the film is noted for is the music and the music comes out nice and clear through your system.I did notice one thing with the audio though.  The Japanese lossless Dolby TrueHD 5.1 sounds awesome but the English DolbyTrue HD 5.1 soundtrack seems a tad lower with the English dialogue.  In fact, through the beginning of the film while watching it with the English lossless soundtrack, I felt that I had to increase the volume a little in order to hear the dialogue clearly and when I switched to the Japanese soundtrack, the dialogue was consistent and much louder.  By no means are the two lossless soundtracks like night and day (like FUNimation Entertainment's Blu-ray release of ""Origin"") but overall, sound effects seem to be consistent on both soundtracks.  But overall, ""Escaflowne: The Movie"" does have a wonderful and immersive soundtrack.Subtitles are in English only.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Escaflowne: The Movie"" comes with the following special features (in 480i Standard Definition):* Trailers: The Girl Who Leaped Through Time and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex Solid State Society* Staff Interviews: (23:00) Featuring staff interviews which include: Director Kazuki Akane/Composer Yoko Anno, Kazuki Akane and Kelly Sheridan (Voice actress for Hitomi), Masahiko Minami (Producer/BONES), Maaya Sakamoto (Voice Actress/Singer), Masuo Ueda (Producer/Sunrise) and a performance by Yoko Kanno, Maaya Sakamoto, Kim Su Jin perform ""The Ring""(Escaflowne Ending Song, Special Duet Version).* Original 2000 Premiere: (7:20) Featuring the following segments: The line at Anime Expo 2000 in Anaheim, CA for the screening of ""Escaflowne: The Movie"", Minoru Takanashi (Producer/Bandai Visual) speaking to the audience before the movie and the Post-Movie Panel Highlights at Anime Expo 2000.JUDGMENT CALL:When it comes to ""Escaflowne: The Movie"", the film has received different results from fans when it first came out.  Diehard fans who were not used to the change, of course, complained.  And for those who treated the movie separately from the anime TV series found the film to be enjoyable, creative and musically wonderful.  Needless to say, I'm part of the latter.  The fact is that many anime series that get a theatrical treatment usually has a story that is not part of the TV series timeline.  And there have been quite a few anime films that have been released that either try to take parts from a long series and condense it down to two hours or try to come up with something different.With ""Escaflowne: The Movie"", you get something different and it's a reimagining that I was open to and at the time, I was very impressed with the results.  The animation was stellar and the music, Yoko Kanno's music and the ending theme by Maaya Sakamoto was just fantastic.So, needless to say... I was excited to hear that ""Escaflowne: The Movie: was receiving its HD treatment and for the most part, I was more curious to see how a film that was created in the late 90's would look on Blu-ray.  Already, Bandai Entertainment has proved to us that they can make it happen as evident with the release of ""Akira"" earlier this year.  So, I had no doubt in my mind that Bandai Entertainment was going to release a solid product.  What I was more concerned about was the lossless soundtrack.  And fortunately, the soundtrack for the most part was immersive and great to hear via lossless.If you are a fan who owns the Ultimate Edition of the DVD, you may be wondering if it's worth the double dip?  Well, for one, you don't want to get rid of that ""Ultimate Edition"" because you get the awesome CD soundtrack and also there are special features such as the galleries that are not included on the Blu-ray.  But to answer the question, yes...it's worth the double dip.  This is the best looking and sounding version of the film yet.  So, if you loved the film, you will definitely want to pick up this Blu-ray.Overall, ""Escaflowne: The Movie"" is a solid Blu-ray release and for those who want to add to their anime on Blu-ray collection, this title is definitely recommended!",4,Blu-ray: If you enjoyed the film and have the original DVD...is it worth the double dip?  YES!!!,1255996800,"10 20, 2009",2009,9605,"['1996', 'Sunrise', 'Studios', 'anime', 'television', 'series', 'Vision', 'Escaflowne', 'aired', 'television', 'not', 'tremendous', 'hit', 'Japan', 'when',

701731,A3W0S9MR4A959D,B000066IXT,dramadude 186,"[1, 2]","First off, I want to say that I absolutely LOVED the Escaflowne TV series.  Its easily one of my top three anime series of all time, and I've seen my fair share.  So of course the idea of a high budget, big screen retelling had me salivating and counting the days until its release.However, the best way to enjoy the Escaflowne movie is to completely forget the TV series.  Otherwise, you'll spend too much time obsessing over everything that's changed rather than focusing on what is, in my opinion, a well written and executed story.So what's different?  The character designs, for one.  Now, you can make fun of the somewhat lanky, Pinnochio-nosed designs for the TV series all you want, but at the end of the day those off-kilter designs just added to the series' charm.  The movie opts for more realistic designs with mixed results.  Van fares the best with his more bulked-up look, while Hitomi looks good with the exception of her oversized eyes.  Yes, they were big in the TV series, but against the hyper-realistic design style of the movie they look out of place.  Allen and Millerna have been reimagined as leather-wearing warriors with a slight S&M; feel to them, while non-humans like Merle and especially Jajuka now look almost scary.  Still, once the initial shock wears off, the character designs begin to grow on you and work for what the movie is trying to accomplish.The tone of the film is also much darker than the series.  While the TV show had its dark moments, most of the truly heavy stuff was hidden underneath the show's bright color pallate.  With the darker colors used here, those darker themes are much more noticeable and the movie loses that air of adventure found in the TV series.  However, the themes found in the movie, including fate, love, and war, are very true to the show, and state more clearly what the TV show only hinted at.It also makes much clearer the love story between Van and Hitomi.  In fact, it is this clear focus that makes the movie work even though its something of a condensation of a thirteen hour, tightly plotted TV show.  There is a storyline about Folken and Dilandau trying to conquer Gaea, and Escaflowne and Hitomi hold the keys to the planet's fate, but most of the other details are cast aside in favor of the love story.  This keeps the movie comprehensible, with fun little throwbacks to the TV show (like cat twins Naria and Eryia singing at Dryden's nightclub) for fans.The movie is absolutely gorgeous, easily one-upping the already impressive animation found on the TV show.  The increased detail and realsim found in the character designs is carried over to ever aspect of the film's look, and the convincing animation makes the movie gel visually.  Again, it doesn't look a whole lot like the TV show, but on its own merits it works marvelously.  And Yoko Kanno has provided another stellar soundtrack, wisely avoiding repeating her TV triumps with the exception of a shortened version of ""Blood of Curse.""Well written and executed, the Escaflowne movie is quite a departure from the TV series.  A reimagining rather than a sequel to the show, the feature shares enough common themes, characters, and plot points to make it clearly recognizable as Escaflowne to anyone who looks beyond the surface.

701733,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B000066IXT,Haunted Flower,"[0, 0]","""Escaflowne"" is the re-telling of the television series, ""The Vision of Escaflowne"". A depressed high school student named Hitomi wishes to just fade away and is magically sucked into a world called Gaea where they called her their Wing Goddess. Multiple forces are struggling against each other there for control of powerful dragon armor that the Wing Goddess is supposed to control so they have to try and win her favor as she has the power to save them or destroy their world entirely.Some of the rag-tag band she befriends includes a kitty-cat girl with a somewhat annoying voice and Van, the last of his kind that can wield a special power that runs in his genes.What I liked most about this movie were the action sequences, fighting over Hitomi and getting to see the dragon armor being used. When a person enters the armor, they have to give blood for it to work so they are pierced all over their body and blood drains from them. For me, I thought that was a pretty powerful way to make the inhabitants sacrifice something before they go running off with a suit that can bring about so much destruction. Having a high price to pay means not just anyone would jump in it.Hitomi is clearly depressed throughout and I'm not sure if she ever really overcame that. She said enough nice things to keep Van motivated and alive when he was hurt but I have this feeling that if she goes home to her own world, her outlook will not have changed.There was pretty music, the plot was occasionally confusing. I never felt emotionally involved or connected to any characters. Only when they were fighting did there seem to be something worth cheering for.

'Escaflowne: The Movie' is essentially a re-telling or ""re-interpretation"" of the original TV series, but with literally everything from the original radically changed. This is not a good thing.Take the characters: it's bad enough that Van and Allen have been turned from fairly chivalrous heroes into ruthless men of action. But to make the awkward-but-endearing heroine Hitomi into a depressed borderline-suicide case is unforgivable. Why you'd want to butcher such a fantastic character, who became the pinup girl for geek guys everywhere, is beyond me. And the antagonists fare no better, with the well-developed Folken of the series reduced to a cardboard-cutout Bad Guy.Remember how the TV series contained elements from nearly every genre: mecha action, fantasy, drama, comedy, and romance? Well, very little has been retained here except the action. The epic feel of the series has been replaced by a more straightforward action-driven plot, and the mood is much darker and more intense than the original. The  animation quality certainly is an improvement on the original thanks to a movie-strength budget, but not even the best artwork will turn a poor anime into a good one.Really, you can hardly call this 'Escaflowne' at all.  None of the characters are how they used to be, the plot is a fairly derivative action-fest compared to the series, and the mood is more suited to a dark, violent thriller. It's hard to understand what the creators were hoping for with this movie....was it for the fans of the series or for newcomers? Either way, it fails at whatever it was trying to achieve, since newcomers will be confused and die-hard fans outraged. Obivously somebody forgot that you don't mess with a winning formula.I strongly recommend the original TV series, which was one of my personal favourite anime.

When I purchased it, I had never seen the TV series or even heard of it, and I was not dissapointed.  The movie has a dark and serious feel to it and the fighting seens are awesome.  After watching the movie, I was so engrossed with Escaflowne, that I jumped on Amazon and bought the series.  At this time I am currently still working through the series, and all though there are discrepancies between the movie and the series, they are both still fantastic.  The tv series has a child like feel to it where as the movie is much darker and serious.  I have read reviews where people compare Cowboy Bebop and Evagelion to Escaflowne, and that is something that you just can't do.  All three are totally different types of Anime.  If you are curious about Escaflowne, but not ready to drop the money down for the tv set, get the movie, but be warned...after watching the movie, you will want the tv series.  Also remember that the movie and the series are for the most part the same thing.  The movie is a 96 min version of the tv series with some differences.

I figure that this movie is sort of in the style of Rahxephon's movie, meaning it's almost like a recap of the series. So if you've seen the series you don't really need to see this. Watching it before the series make this movie a gigantic spoiler. When I was young gun in anime I saw this movie before Escaflowne the series and I could only imagine what the series would be like, so I can give a review not influenced by the series.It blends so much that you really have no choice but to let your eye catch the beautiful but a bit spotty animation. The true magic that brings you in is the sort of calm feeling the depressed and suicidal Hitomi gives off in the beginning, though she's supposed to be those things she's really to meek to do any of it. I can't lie because it can get a little boring and dark with too much talking and badly dimmed scenes, even the heart pounding music cant bring you out of a power nap.I have tried but for some reason I haven't been able to watch this movie more than a few times so I guess it's time to move on to the series. It's obvious that this film is not all close to it's original series but it is a nice way to get into wanting to see Escaflowne the TV series. It can get a little too dark and talkative at times. I really think there isn't enough action to keep you coming back to see this. Some of the boring stuff comes from them trying to re-explain stuff. Hitomi's character doesn't develop the way you want and she spends the entire movie being scared and a pain in the neck. Hitomi can really give you a headache with her whining too.

701740,ASHS3J6EWUVUD,B000066IXT,K.M. Viglione,"[0, 1]","As someone who loves the Escaflowne series, this movie was very disappointing. I had been receptive to a great deal of the hype, but that was pretty much all it was. Trying to re-tell the series in one movie wasn't the best move.There were obviously character changes. I was never a fan of Hitomi in the series, and her character hasn't improved in the movie. I couldn't even tell if the movie was trying to imply a romance between her and Van, as it was in the series. Folken, who was a very dynamic character in the show, is more like a villianous pawn for the animators; a tool for stirring up conflict.Overall, the movie has highly detailed animation, but little worthwhile character development, and not much of a plot. Some of the character designs are nice, but others are awful. Some look a a great deal like the series counterparts, but others, such as with Folken or Millerna, looking nothing like them. Personalites have also changed as well. Hitomi is rather depressed, although we don't really know why, so it's easier to chalk it up to the drama of being a teenager. Van is all angst and not much else. The movie mostly drags you along for the ride. If you're an action buff, this may be good for you.The one character who didn't change and I found I enjoyed about as much as his anime counterpart was Dilandau. Still insane, still likes to watch things burn.This 3 disc set also comes with the soundtrack, which makes the set a little more worthwile (and why I gave this review 3 stars). Yoko Kanno's work is top notch, and Maaya Sakamoto's vocals are pleasing to the ear. The theme song, ""Yubiwa"" doesn't fit the movie, but it's lovely and a nice song that can stand by itself.

701742,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B000066IXT,Lesley Aeschliman,"[1, 1]","In this remake film, the characters of Hitomi and Van are given very different personalities than their counterparts in the anime series.  In the series, Hitomi is a happy girl in love, while her movie counterpart is depressed and suicidal.  With this portrayal, it's hard to care about Hitomi, even though she's supposed to be the main character.  In the film, Van is lonely and more aggressive than this television series counterpart.The basic story of the film is that a depressed Hitomi is brought to Gaea as the legendary ""Wing Goddess"" and awakens Escaflowne.  Escaflowne disappears into a jewel that Hitomi keeps in her possession.  Hitomi and Van must learn to work together in order to try to save Gaea from destruction.  However, how the film depicts Van's change in attitude toward Hitomi just feels forced.In the film, the role for the character of Dilandau was greatly diminished in comparison to the television series.  With this reduction in the role, Dilandau felt more like a prop than an actual character.  This, along with the other changes that were made for the film version, really weakened the story.  The only redeeming qualities that this film has are some of the visuals and the music score.The DVD release for Escaflowne the Movie allows you to watch the film with Japanese DTS 5.1, Japanese DD 5.1, English DD 5.1, or Isolated Score DD 5.1 audio.  For subtitles, you can choose between English, Storyboards, and None.  For the ""Storyboards"" option, the corresponding storyboards for the scene appear in the subtitle track rather than text.  Unfortunately, since the storyboard subtitles are only available in Japanese, you have to have some knowledge of the Japanese language in order to understand what's going on.  The only bonus features included on the disc are trailers and credits.I was rather disappointed in Escaflowne the Movie.  I would only recommend this DVD to viewers who enjoy the film or to viewers who are fans of The Vision of Escaflowne and want to have all the Escaflowne related material in their DVD collection.I wrote this review after watching a copy of this DVD that my husband and I purchased.",2,This film was not as good as the anime series,1334016000,"04 10, 2012",2012,2147,"['remake', 'film', 'characters', 'Hitomi', 'Van', 'are', 'given', 'very', 'different', 'personalities', 'counterparts', 'anime', 'series', 'series', 'Hitomi', 'happy', 'girl', 'love', 'movie', 'counterpart', 'depressed', 'suicidal', 'portrayal', 'hard', 'care', 'Hitomi', 'even', 'supposed', 'be', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'Van', 'lonely', 'more', 'aggressive', 'television', 'series', 'counterpart.The', 'basic', 'story', 'film', 'depressed', 'Hitomi', 'brought', 'Gaea', 'legendary', 'Wing', 'Goddess', 'Escaflowne', 'Escaflowne', 'jewel', 'Hitomi', 'possession', 'Hitomi', 'Van', 'must', 'learn', 'work', 'together', 'order', 'try', 'save', 'Gaea', 'destruction', 'However', 'how', 'film', 'Van', 'change', 'attitude', 'Hitomi', 'just', 'forced.In', 'film', 'role', 'character', 'Dilandau', 'was', 'greatly', 'diminished', 'comparison', 'television', 'series', 'reduction', 'role', 'Dilandau', 'felt', 'more', 'prop', 'actual', 'character', 'other', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'film', 'version', 'really', 'weakened', 'story', 'only', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'film', 'are', 'visuals', 'music', 'score.The', 'DVD', 'release', 'Escaflowne', 'Movie', 'watch', 'film', 'Japanese', 'DTS', '5.1', 'Japanese', 'DD', '5.1', 'English', 'DD', '5.1', 'Isolated', 'Score', 'DD', '5.1', 'audio', 'subtitles', 'can', 'choose', 'English', 'Storyboards', 'None', 'Storyboards', 'option', 'corresponding', 'storyboards', 'scene', 'appear', 'subtitle', 'track', 'rather', 'text', 'Unfortunately', 'storyboard', 'subtitles', 'are', 'only', 'available', 'Japanese', 'have', 'have', 'knowledge', 'Japanese', 'language', 'order', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'only', 'bonus', 'features', 'included', 'disc', 'are', 'trailers', 'credits.I', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'Escaflowne', 'Movie', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'viewers', 'who', 'enjoy', 'film', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'Vision', 'Escaflowne', 'want', 'have', 'Escaflowne', 'related', 'material', 'DVD', 'collection.I', 'wrote', 'review', 'watching', 'copy', 'DVD', 'husband', 'purchased']",N/A

She fears things will never change, is so depressed that she hopes that somehow she will just fade away.  What she doesn't expect is that her desire to escape would catapult her into the mythic world of Gaea.  From a young highschool student, she finds herself thrust into the role of the Wing Goddess, who can call up Escaflowne, a terrible suit of giant armor destined to destroy the world.  Hitomi's first encounter on Gaea is with Van, a king whose people were destroyed by his jealous brother.  First, she is badly frightened, then deeply attracted to this lonely, tormented boy.Unfortunately, there is hardly time for romance.  Van and his brother both attempt to gain control of Hitomi and, through her, Escaflowne.  A war is building and Van must fight repeatedly for his life.  Director Kazuki Akano is kind to his viewers, and the fight scenes alternate with visions of the loveliness Gaea contains, as reflected in both the scenery and the wondrous creatures that people it.  We do not need to be told for what Van and Hitomi are fighting, we see it repeatedly before our eyes.The documentation and extras that come with this set repeatedly make the point that this film is not a recap of the series, but an alternate tale set in the same world with the same characters.  Hitomi and Van are older and more mature, and the film spends far less time on the theme of destiny that drove the series, focusing instead on the feelings and emotional contexts of the characters.  For me this adds great impact to the film, which is already notable for artistic imagery and a superb score.I'm not a big fan of the interviews which make up many disks of extras, but I found those that came with this set quite interesting.  All of the participants seem to conscious of having made a truly special film, and are justifiably proud.  I even found myself repeatedly listening to the CD of music from the lush score by Yoko Kanno.One of the reasons I have come to like anime as an art form, is that it always manages to surprise.  Born from the world of comics and manga, the Japanese have taken a relatively straightforward medium and turned it into something where magic works, giant robot suits are used to fight for the futures of planets, and comedy, romance and horror can cheerfully coexist in settings both rare and commonplace.  This is the world of 'Escaflowne.' A story made richer for the retelling.",5,Wasurenaide...

IE, similar or the same characters may be put into a similarly named world in different series. However, it's not always the case that continuity from one series spills over into the next. One might think of anime an an infinite number of ""alternate realities."" IE, the people and names may be the same, but the overall history and current events may be wholly different.That said, anime movies are sometimes (but not always) a ""re-imagining"" or ""alternate reality"" of what is contained in a given ""series"" or ""complete collection."" For exampleMagic Knight Rayearth: TV Series Season One and Twovs.Rayearth. Both are based on the same world and concept, but take it in rather different directions with different themes and execution.So, in saying that a movie is disappointing because it doesn't follow the same continuity as the main series, one is only showing one's ignorance of how anime works. Personally, I think the movie stands on its own just as well as any other anime movie (regardless of whether it's attached to a specific ""series"" or not).I specifically watched the movie FIRST in order to not be tainted ni my expectations of what the movie should be. At least partly because others had mentioned online that the movie is significantly different from the series. Being something of a recent anime fan, I'm not off-put by the dissimilarity, as I understand there are differences between eastern ""anime"" and western ""cartoons"" or ""animated series.""That said, the movie is considerably darker than series. There may be some reliance on viewers having seen the series. But it provides as much ""back story"" as many other anime movies (IE, very little). This isn't entirely unexpected to the seasoned anime watcher (which I'm slowly becoming).The visuals are decent, on par with stuff from the same period. The story is interesting, if about as believable as many other animes (marginally). I might have preferred a bit more, and might have been rather reminded of ""Magic Knight Rayearth"" in some of the themes. But overall, I wasn't disappointed.That said, if you go into watching it with the expectation of it being exactly the same as or a continuation of the series, you're both short changing yourself and the film. Give it a chance on its own merits, with the understanding that it's its own work. Loosely based off the original mangas (japanese comics), but not ""the same as"" the series (different continuity, look, feel and themes). Call them ""separate but equal"" if you will.Overall, I was pleased with it.",4,"A good showing, despite a few negative reviews on this site.",1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,2825,"['So', 'few', 'people', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'anime', 'rules', 'lack', 'thereof.Whereas', 'western', 'audience', 'certain', 'expectation', 'continuity', 'similarity', 'respect', 'plot', 'world', 'manga', 'and/or', 'anime', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bound', 'convention', 'IE', 'similar', 'same', 'characters', 'may', 'be', 'put', 'similarly', 'named', 'world', 'different', 'series', 'However', 'not', 'always', 'case', 'continuity', 'one', 'series', 'next', 'One', 'might', 'think', 'anime', 'infinite', 'number', 'alternate', 'realities', 'IE', 'people', 'names', 'may', 'be', 'same', 'overall', 'history', 'current', 'events', 'may', 'be', 'wholly', 'said', 'anime', 'movies', 'are', 'sometimes', 'not', 'always', 're-imagining', 'alternate', 'reality', 'what', 'contained', 'given', 'series', 'complete', 'collection', 'exampleMagic', 'Knight', 'Rayearth', 'TV', 'Series', 'Season', 'One', 'Twovs.Rayearth', 'are', 'based', 'same', 'world', 'concept', 'take', 'rather', 'different', 'directions', 'different', 'themes', 'execution.So', 'saying', 'movie', 'disappointing', ""n't"", 'follow', 'same', 'continuity', 'main', 'series', 'one', 'only', 'showing', 'one', 'ignorance', 'how', 'anime', 'works', 'Personally', 'think', 'movie', 'own', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'anime', 'movie', 'regardless', 'attached', 'specific', 'series', 'not', '.I', 'specifically', 'watched', 'movie', 'FIRST', 'order', 'not', 'be', 'tainted', 'ni', 'expectations', 'what', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'least', 'partly', 'others', 'had', 'mentioned', 'online', 'movie', 'significantly', 'different', 'series', 'Being', 'something', 'recent', 'anime', 'fan', ""'m"", 'not', 'off-put', 'dissimilarity', 'understand', 'are', 'differences', 'eastern', 'anime', 'western', 'cartoons', 'animated', 'series', 'said', 'movie', 'considerably', 'darker', 'series', 'may', 'be', 'reliance', 'viewers', 'having', 'seen', 'series', 'as', 'much', 'back', 'story', 'many', 'other', 'anime', 'movies', 'IE', 'very', 'little', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'unexpected', 'seasoned', 'anime', 'watcher', ""'m"", 'slowly', 'becoming', '.The', 'visuals', 'are', 'decent', 'par', 'stuff', 'same', 'period', 'story', 'interesting', 'about', 'as', 'believable', 'many', 'other', 'animes', 'marginally', 'might', 'have', 'preferred', 'bit', 'more', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'reminded', 'Magic', 'Knight', 'Rayearth', 'themes', 'overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed.That', 'said', 'go', 'watching', 'expectation', 'being', 'exactly', 'same', 'continuation', 'series', ""'re"", 'short', 'changing', 'film', 'Give', 'chance', 'own', 'merits', 'understanding', 'own', 'work', 'Loosely', 'based', 'off', 'original', 'mangas', 'japanese', 'comics', 'not', 'same', 'series', 'different', 'continuity', 'look', 'feel', 'themes', 'Call', 'separate', 'equal', 'will.Overall', 'was', 'pleased']",N/A

In the magical world of Gaia, two ancient Dragon Clans (Black and White...how original) are vying for the control of the mystical armor, Escaflowne.  Meanwhile, Hitomi, the standard so-full-of-angst-I-should-open-a-store-for-it teenage girl dreams of leaving her existence.  But lo and behold, through the magic of film, she *gasp!* leaves her existence only to be transported to Gaia where she is hailed as the Wing Goddess who will set the world right.One of the main problems with this film is the source material.  It's hard to watch this without feeling a bit left in the dark, if you haven't watched the series.  Yet, at the same time it's hard to watch it having seen the series because the movie manages to mash up the high points of the series, leaving the viewer with something that resembles a parfait that met its demise under a mallet.The characters act as they did in the original TV series, but minus the full fleshed out stories and lives that made them interesting.  So, you really can't feel anything for these poor cardboard cutouts.  Most of that can be thanked by the lame script which features such lines as ""Lord Van...Lord Van!!...Lord Van..."" and ""Pleased to meet you, Mister Folken.""  As if they didn't make enough brain destroying drugs, in walks the dialouge.Gaia has changed in the same manner as well.  Gaia, for a world teeming with magic and imagination, has somehow lost it all.  Now everything seems to be borrowed from other anime.  The animals look like something out of a Miyazaki film, the battle scenes seem like they took lessons from a poor man's ""Ninja Scroll,"" the soldiers seemed to have bought their armor from a ""Lodoss War"" garage sale, and in the funniest way possible, soldiers now have magic powers that are NEVER explained only to make them resemble rejects from ""Akira.""Oh, and one more gripe, WHERE'S ESCAFLOWNE???  Seriously, for something that could either shape of destroy the world you think it would be on-screen longer.  Every scene where the massive armor is not in you wonder where the hell is it, and why isn't doing anything important.  Oh, and Escaflowne has also changed, but I will not dis-hearten anymore of the fans.The only saving grace is that the film was, as stated before, created by the same team as ""Cowboy Bebop.""  And that means that the music is done by, that's right, Yoko Kanno.  Kanno's score permeates through the film and actually keeps your attention a whole lot longer than anything the script ahs to offer.  Another grace is the animation.  Things look great, but sadly that's it.  Too bad these good things were severly wasted.In the end, ""Escaflowne"" boasts a lot of appeal, but sadly leaves everyone in the dust wanting something with, I don't know, taste perhaps?  One must ask themselves, who is this movie really for?  Is it for the fans, or is it for those who are interested but haven't visited the world of Gaia?  Sadly, it's for neither.

Kellner ""PAK""","[1, 3]","I should first say that I have not watched the series, but will follow that up by saying that this movie has not persuaded me to do so. I am a casual anime fan and for reference will say that the anime's I have enjoyed include Dragon Ball Z, Outlaw star, Cow boy bebop and Ninja Scroll.  If you have only seen 2 movies in your life time and the other one was ""Big top Pee-Wee"", then maybe (and I stress maybe) I could understand a 5 star review. If you are a die hard fan of anime and if all it takes is a couple of bloody scenes this may be for you. If you are 15 years old you might be impressed with this. However if you expect depth of character, story evolution and strong plot, skip this.In a nut shell some girl is depressed and wants to disappear/Die, what ever, so she disappears and shows up in Gaea as the Wing Goddess. Two separate factions have been warring with each other over a dragon armor suit that holds the fate of the world. The girl is the key to the suit in a way it goes to whom ever she decides; the good guys get it the end. Believe me when I say this is the better telling of that story and the less painful one.The Good: a couple of good fight scenes and the animation were pretty good.The Bad: The tone of a movie is very important and this story was way over dramatized. The characters aren't developed at all so you can't really bring your self to care about them, or want to pay attention to them. The movie felt like they were trying to squeeze the content of a long draw out series into 95 minutes and they failed miserably.

701753,AWFD44Q17PCOV,B000066IXT,paxnirvana,"[1, 2]","Well, I'm writing this review without looking at any other reviews first - just the overall ranking - because I flat don't agree with it.The TV series had a wonderful whimsical, intriguing, mystical feel with the giant magical mecha suits, its odd combination of magic and technology, and the girl lost in a strange world storyline, but this movie gives us a fakey angsty twist on the main character that I found completely pointless and rather annoying.  It did nothing for the main storyline and made her seem rather pathetic, in the end, rather than heroic.  There wasn't enough motivation given for any kind of change in her  character and it all came off as rather flat.  Hitomi deserved better treatment than that.The visuals are also extremely dark, if beautifully designed, and the battles can get a little confusing because of it (but Van's initial attack on the airship carrying Escaflowne... wow!  Brutal and savage and incredibly rendered in near-monochromatic silhouette... oh yes, kiddies, swords are NOT toys...) but I was vastly disappointed to find that most of the main characters had been reduced to mere leather-clad charactures of themselves or given inconsequential cameos.  (Dryden? Allen? Gaddes?  Naria & Eriya?  Cripes... was *that* Millerna?!  Somehow I don't think she's studying to be a doctor anymore... *sigh*)The re-design of Escaflowne itself was interesting (as was the twist on how the suit bonded to Van... blood... *shiver*), but not much more than that.  Besides, it was just too dark most of the time to see it very well... and I prefer the suit's original incarnation and it's old flying dragon-form to the new design.Dilandau's obsessiveness was nicely highlighted as was Van's pain at the choices necessary in the end, but overall I was highly disappointed with the movie.  I expected something with at least a little of the charm and pagentry, heroism and melancholy of the series and got a grim, battle-heavy, dark, angst-fest instead. (Oh, poor Folken!)  Some of the fight scenes are cool, but, unfortunately, they don't have as intriguing a story around them to make them have a real point.  Why do we really care about the final duel here?  And that's one of the best scenes in the series... the final duel between Dilandau and Van... with Allen stepping in... everything had built to that point.  This movie takes the barest, barest essentials of the plot of what is a rather complex series and crams it into a single movie.  It just loses too much for me, and I felt they could have handled the condensing with more care - or picked a sub-plot from the series to expand into something more true to the source rather than this odd re-hash of the whole thing.I've already bought it - and Van's first fight is incredible to watch - so I'll keep it, but frankly the TV series itself is far better.  I recommend you pick that up instead.  (And you'll even get used to the ski-jump noses after a while too... *grin*  They grow on 'ya.)",2,I expected so much more...,1044057600,"02 1, 2003",2003,2978,"['Well', ""'m"", 'writing', 'review', 'looking', 'other', 'reviews', 'first', 'just', 'overall', 'ranking', 'flat', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'it.The', 'TV', 'series', 'had', 'wonderful', 'whimsical', 'intriguing', 'mystical', 'feel', 'giant', 'magical', 'mecha', 'suits', 'odd', 'combination', 'magic', 'technology', 'girl', 'lost', 'strange', 'world', 'storyline', 'movie', 'fakey', 'angsty', 'twist', 'main', 'character', 'found', 'completely', 'pointless', 'rather', 'annoying', 'did', 'nothing', 'main', 'storyline', 'made', 'seem', 'rather', 'pathetic', 'end', 'rather', 'heroic', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'motivation', 'given', 'kind', 'change', 'character', 'came', 'off', 'rather', 'flat', 'Hitomi', 'deserved', 'better', 'treatment', 'that.The', 'visuals', 'are', 'also', 'extremely', 'dark', 'beautifully', 'designed', 'battles', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'confusing', 'Van', 'initial', 'attack', 'airship', 'carrying', 'Escaflowne', 'wow', 'Brutal', 'savage', 'incredibly', 'rendered', 'near-monochromatic', 'silhouette', 'oh', 'yes', 'kiddies', 'swords', 'are', 'NOT', 'toys', 'was', 'vastly', 'disappointed', 'find', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'had', 'been', 'reduced', 'mere', 'leather-clad', 'charactures', 'given', 'inconsequential', 'cameos', 'Dryden', 'Allen', 'Gaddes', 'Naria', 'Eriya', 'Cripes', 'was', '*that*', 'Millerna', 'Somehow', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'studying', 'be', 'doctor', 'anymore', '*sigh*', 're-design', 'Escaflowne', 'was', 'interesting', 'was', 'twist', 'how', 'suit', 'bonded', 'Van', 'blood', '*shiver*', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'dark', 'most', 'time', 'see', 'very', 'well', 'prefer', 'suit', 'original', 'incarnation', 'old', 'flying', 'dragon-form', 'new', 'design.Dilandau', 'obsessiveness', 'was', 'nicely', 'highlighted', 'was', 'Van', 'pain', 'choices', 'necessary', 'end', 'overall', 'was', 'highly', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'expected', 'something', 'least', 'little', 'charm', 'pagentry', 'heroism', 'melancholy', 'series', 'got', 'grim', 'battle-heavy', 'dark', 'angst-fest', 'instead', 'Oh', 'poor', 'Folken', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'cool', 'unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'intriguing', 'story', 'make', 'have', 'real', 'point', 'Why', 'do', 'really', 'care', 'final', 'duel', 'here', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'series', 'final', 'duel', 'Dilandau', 'Van', 'Allen', 'stepping', 'everything', 'had', 'built', 'point', 'movie', 'barest', 'barest', 'essentials', 'plot', 'what', 'rather', 'complex', 'series', 'crams', 'single', 'movie', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'handled', 'condensing', 'more', 'care', 'picked', 'sub-plot', 'series', 'expand', 'something', 'more', 'true', 'source', 'rather', 'odd', 're-hash', 'whole', 'thing.I', ""'ve"", 'already', 'bought', 'Van', 'first', 'fight', 'incredible', 'watch', 'so', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'frankly', 'TV', 'series', 'far', 'better', 'recommend', 'pick', 'up', 'instead', ""'ll"", 'even', 'get', 'used', 'ski-jump', 'noses', 'while', 'too', 'grow', ""'ya""]",N/A

701755,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B000066IXT,P. Hardy,"[0, 0]","I've seen the series ""the vision Esacflowne"" and have to ta' say I liked it much better when it was Edited on FOX KIDS because it focused more on Van Fanel, although the uncut version wasn't bad but it didn't appeal to me. That said, you do not have to see the series to watch ""Escaflowne: The movie"" [Girl in Gaia-- Japanese title].The movie is more of a retelling of the series with better animation and slightly better drawings with dimension to them. The plot is fairly different from the series, Hitomi's slightly the same wimpy high-school girl, with the exception that she has a Death wish no longer wanting to be apart of the world, but cannot will herself to commit suicide. Depressed and down on her luck, Hitomi unconsciously transports herself to the world of ""Gaia"" (which is the correct spelling of the word, not Gaea) where she meets Van Fanel; a survivor of small kingdom attacked and is apart of a small group consisting of Allen, Melerina, and the rest of the characters in the series, only this time everyone except Van and Hitomi have very minor roles.Everyone believes that Hitomi is someone called ""The Wing Goddess"" sent to help them in their time of need but Hitomi knows nothing of this. Thus, she begins her quest to find her way home and help the people of Gaia out in any way she can despite the fact she knows so little about what's going on around her. For a movie over 60 minutes, it lacks a strong plot and depth.The story is sort of shallow compared to the almost non-consitent series plot and it moves rather slowly at times and then sometimes too quickly to even keep up with the events that are going on, there is no character development either.For instance they never explain why Hitomi Kanzaki quits the track race, why she (or Folken and Van for that matter) are depressed and want so badly to die in whatever type of danger come's their way, or who, for that matter, the Wing Goddess is, her origins, and purpouse she had in the destruction or salvation of Gaia. And Lastly, why'd Folken attack his so-called homeland (aside from the reason they pointed out) Fanelia and who this character Sora is.The creators must've decided that the one thing that would keep you watching this movie is heavy and uneccesary useage of blood in all the action scenes, and a violent Van Fanel, blood thirsty and war hungry. The only improvement on Hitomi's character is that she doesn't object to Van killing his brother Dune or Folken of the black dragon clan or killing for that matter, but she still does nothing to protect herself when danger is afoot.She just stands there excepting Van or the others to save her (they do, naturally; she is their so-called savior). The relationship between Van and Hitomi is not romantic, its platontic this time thankfully. The English dub has gotten much better retaining all the original voices, the Japanese dub is not bad at all either, the special features consists of trailers, subtitles and language slection, etc. All in all the movie isn't bad, its a lot of fun to watch action-wise but lacks in depth and a good plot.

For a while, Escaflowne had its anime series on television, on saturdays, and it was a very good alternative to the shallow cartoons that were on. Strangly the show stoped airing over here, just when i was getting more and more interested.Anyways... i discovered the Escaflowne movie a while ago and recently found it on sale at the store, and i was looking for a good anime film to buy, and i had good memory of Escaflowne as a quality anime show, one of the very few well done animated shows aired in the USA, and id allways wanted to see the movie, i figured it would be epic and powerfull, like award winning.It turns out that this movie sums up the Escaflowne story. Without giving away anything, it starts out with Hitomi on Earth and somehow being transported eventually, to this other world and meeting these new people. So it doesnt apparently start where the series left off, its the story of Escaflowne condensed to fit into movie form.The animation is not bad...but isnt exactly theatrical release quality, i was expecting something on the lines of Miyazaki quality, but the animation is just a bit above the anime series, with the characters looking slighty more matured and a bit more well defined. Im not sure, but maybe this was made for DVD, perhaps it didnt get the big motion picture treatment in Japan.The characters are allright, all the voice actors who did the characters on the anime series reprise their roles i believe for the movie, like Lord Vonn, Hitomi and Meryl, not to mention the villians.There is battle between Lord Vonn and one of the bad guys, where Vonn uses Escaflowne against the bad guys own armor, right before the confrontation with Lord Vulcan ( Vonns older brother). Its good, but it made me wanna see more. There wasnt much battles in the movie, it was more story driven i guess.The story is not bad, it just made me feel kinda bored in areas, i didnt feel too involved in it. But thats just me. It just didnt unfold as great or as grand as it seemed it would judging from the movies trailor.The music in this movie is good, i really like Escaflowne theme that has the choral singing, its one of the most impressive themes ive heard for an anime.The series of Escaflowne is definatly worth watching if you like this movie but felt it lacked some things or if you felt like you didnt get enuff. The anime series is real well done, and has intense battles, a complex enjoyable story and even more memorable music, like its opening intro music.

However, I am not a big fan of major fantasy animes, at least not the hard core fantasy. Sometimes the fantasy storylines seem to be overstuffed with magic, characters, legends and twists. Complex stories are too much work. Call me lazy, I don't care.Yet, my husband mentioned he saw this Escaflowne Movie at the video store, so I picked it up.I was pretty impressed with the artwork. The characters were uniquely drawn. Sometimes their eyes looked kind of freaky. It reminded me of the sequence in the Evangelion Movie where Shinji is a boy playing in the sand with those two dolls. The roundness of how they were drawn was a bit over done. But it added to the surreal effect they were trying to achieve.Also I really like how venerable the main character was portrayed. She did not have special skills or weapons to defend herself. All she had was her powers and good heart.The Van character was the typical hero that you find in an anime. He sort of resembled Hiro from Gundamn Wing with his anger issues and quest for vengence. But I wouldn't expect anything less from Japanese writers.I have read the other reviews about how the series was better and how the movie is rather disappointing. That may be, but since I have never seen the series, I wouldn't know. The movie is a bit rushed as others have written and the characters are underdeveloped, but it is still a very good anime. The music is mesmerizing and the story is very interesting. Looking at this movie as an independent move away from the series, it definitely deserves more credit than people have given it.The only problem I found with the movie: you want to story to continue!

In hindsight, I'd just as soon have waited for it on DVD. It's not that there was anything particularly BAD about the movie, it's just that there was nothing particularly GOOD about it either. Quite frankly, there just wasn't much to write home about. Sorcery, sword fights, a chosen one, warring clans, mobile suit (oops, I mean guymelef) battles...they're all there, but nothing really stands out about them.The movie is a remake of the television series, with a lot of twists and turns in it. Here, instead of being the king of a ruined country, Van travels with a band called the Abaharaki, made up of the survivors of the Black Dragon Clan. He is savage and feral here, and his brutal slaughter of the bad guys in the first few minutes of the movie is a highlight. Hitomi, instead of the outgoing track star from the TV show, is now perpetually depressed and unhappy. Think Shinji Ikari from ""Eva"". Allen is as cool as ever, and Merle remains pretty much the same. Millerna...well...she doesn't wear as much in the movie, looking more like Xena than a regular princess. Dilandau is as annoying as ever, but thankfully the 2-hour time limit cuts down on the amount of boring speeches we hear from Folken.Those are really the main differences. None of them are so jarring as to make the characters unrecognizable, but then again, they don't really add anything new, either. The movie does have some high points, though. Van slicing his way through bad guys like a wood chipper, Allen and Van's (embarrassingly one-sided) battle, the Abaharaki's reaction to how strange Hitomi looks...and of course, the best part...finding out what happens when sorcery is applied liberally to an enemy's horse.

I brought it home and I was watching it, completely intrigued by the beautiful animation, but then a bunch of green tiles filled my screen and I realized that I had been had.Well, at least the first half of the movie looks very very good..Hitomi isn't so ditsy here, which is a bit relieving. I enjoyed her voice better in the movie than in the series. Brian Drummond plays Allen, and he does the perfect job. Allen looks really hot in the movie too. The animation took my breath away, and I was gasping in amazement a lot. I love Dilandau, so when I saw how cool he was drawn, and that he has actual powers, I was going, &quot;thank you thank you thank you....&quot; But really, the fact that they went a more 'realistic' route with this, makes it altogether different from the series. It's familiar characters in a new world.(new to us.)And if there's some younger folk in the home, please be careful watching this one-especially the beginning scene when Van slashes his way through that ship.Van is cooler too, because he is really good at fighting. In the series, he was more of a young kid who couldn't do hand to hand combat very well, he depended on Escaflowne. But I think that fans of Van, will be very pleasantly surprised.That's all for now.

Not to be a killjoy, but the movie lacks anything to get me interested and caring about the characters at ALL.  It was like watching a Road Rules marathon on MTV.  You don't give a dang about any of the losers in it.I couldn't place the cause of this, and then realized what it was: rather than try to do a followup or prequel that would've been decent they tried to ram the entirety of the 26 part series into one movie.  Absolutely NONE of the intrigue and complexity survives this compacting.  Zip, nada, bupkiss.  It's two dimensional and stale.If that wasn't enough, the parts the characters play are totally switched around.  Any semblance of the magic and intelligent writing the Series showed is out the window, leaving you feeling cheated and ripped off.The end is typically existentialist, to the detriment of the film.  Whereas the Series ended with a sort of downer, but realistic ending the movie doesn't even attempt it.  It just ends and you don't know what the heck is going on.  After having a similar experience with Evangelion, it is my sincere belief that the Japanese need some Western writers to ride herd on them.Existentialist morals mongering can kill a perfectly good and beautiful story.  The writing and the characters get lost in the message.  Escaflowne: The Movie tries to pull it off and gets lost in the waves of its own changes.  To quote Marley, ""Please don't you rock my boat, cuz I don't want my boat to be rockin'.""  They should have listened to him.Detested this so much compared to the series I would've given it two stars were it not so pretty.  If you're after art, check it out.  If you're after storyline, don't bother with this unless it comes bundled with the Series.  The two are such different animals (and calibers of storytelling) I was amazed the same team did both.

I read the reviews and most people said that it is best if you take the movie on its own terms without comparing it to the series.Well I have to admit, that's a little hard to do.  People who have seen the series will be absolutely flabbergasted that their favorite characters and storyline have been butchered into something boderline incoherent.  People who haven't seen the show will likely be very confused and bored by the storyline which seems to cram way to much into too little time (hardly a surprise considering the source material).Although I didn't really care for the character redesigns, I have to say that visually Escaflowne is a spectacular movie.  The opening scene where Van bisects the crew of an airship is worth a rental at least.  The problem is that the creators forgot what made Escaflowne the series so special to begin with.  It wasn't the animation, the giant Gymelfs or even the storyline (although it was excellent).  No, Escaflowne's biggest appeal was the endearing characters, especially Van, Hitomi and Folken.  The problem with the movie is that I actually detested the characters movie counterparts as they exhibited exactly none of the facination of the series.So what are we left with here?  A boring movie with stale dialogue, uninteresting characters and an absolute affront to fans of the TV show that has some remarkably stunning visuals.  Would I recommend it?  No, visuals alone do not make a movie and if you liked the Escaflowne series even a little bit then you probably don't want to see this movie as it will likely leave a very bitter taste in your mouth over all the wasted potential that is here.",2,What is this tripe?,1027036800,"07 19, 2002",2002,1757,"['went', 'movie', 'lover', 'Escaflowne', 'series', 'knew', 'not', 'set', 'expectations', 'too', 'high', 'read', 'reviews', 'most', 'people', 'said', 'best', 'take', 'movie', 'own', 'terms', 'comparing', 'series.Well', 'have', 'admit', 'little', 'hard', 'do', 'People', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'absolutely', 'flabbergasted', 'favorite', 'characters', 'storyline', 'have', 'been', 'butchered', 'something', 'boderline', 'incoherent', 'People', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'very', 'confused', 'bored', 'storyline', 'cram', 'way', 'much', 'too', 'little', 'time', 'hardly', 'surprise', 'considering', 'source', 'material', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'character', 'redesigns', 'have', 'say', 'visually', 'Escaflowne', 'spectacular', 'movie', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'Van', 'crew', 'airship', 'rental', 'least', 'problem', 'creators', 'forgot', 'what', 'made', 'Escaflowne', 'series', 'so', 'special', 'begin', 'was', ""n't"", 'animation', 'giant', 'Gymelfs', 'even', 'storyline', 'was', 'excellent', 'No', 'Escaflowne', 'biggest', 'appeal', 'was', 'endearing', 'characters', 'especially', 'Van', 'Hitomi', 'Folken', 'problem', 'movie', 'actually', 'detested', 'characters', 'movie', 'counterparts', 'exhibited', 'exactly', 'none', 'facination', 'series.So', 'what', 'are', 'left', 'here', 'boring', 'movie', 'stale', 'dialogue', 'uninteresting', 'characters', 'absolute', 'affront', 'fans', 'TV', 'show', 'remarkably', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'Would', 'recommend', 'No', 'visuals', 'alone', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'movie', 'liked', 'Escaflowne', 'series', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'then', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'likely', 'leave', 'very', 'bitter', 'taste', 'mouth', 'wasted', 'potential', 'here']",N/A

Rent it before you buy it. I've talked with several people, equally fanatical over the original series. They either love the movie or they hate it.Personally, I love it.The art is totally differant from the series, less bishonian. The english dubbing effort FAR surpasses that of the series. Taking it down to only having two melef units in the movie really made you belief they were something special. Maybe it's just me, but the Escaflowne, even though it did have some nice tweeks compared to others, still seemed like just another melef unit to me in the series.As stated before in other reviews, the characters are completely differant from the series. Some characters don't even get more than a few seconds of screen time. I personally would have liked to have seen more of Naria and Eriya. But then, only being 96 minutes long, I can see why they had to cut down some of the characterization. This is also much much darker than the series. The series had it's share of violence, but it's really nothing compared to what's seen here.Final words: Just because you like the series is no garuntee you're going to like this. Rent it first. Also destroy ALL expectations. This is nothing like the series and really has very little if anything to do with the series.

When she recieves of mysterious pendant she is wisped away into the land of Gaea, which is under siege of the Black Dragon Clan. She is the Wing Goddess, sent to release Escaflowne and save Gaea.

Then there is the audio when is sound coming from 1 speaker and not the other 5 considered True HD 5.1. This is just another reason to prove that Bandai America and the F#&*%ed up Hominese should be shut down permanently and sell there licenses to companies that know what there are doing.

701767,A25JBPU5G0C29H,B000066IXT,Zev Bazarov,"[3, 3]","This is an action fantasy film, that tells the story of a depressed girl who has her wish granted to fade away and is taken to the magical world of Gaia. There she is believed to be the prophesied Wing Goddess who will either save Gaia or destroy it, with the help of the dragon armor Escaflowne. Battles ensue and 2 brothers square off where the outcome of Gaia is decided. The animation is very well done, except for human faces which look very flat. The direction of the battles is also well done and exciting. That's about it though. The story is not that interesting, or believable. By the time I got to the end of the film I really didn't care to see what happens. There are a lot of characters but we never really get to know any of them. Most scenes are not needed, or go unexplained or undeveloped. Only the beginning scene and final confrontation scene have any drama or interesting events. Because of that, and the battle scenes are done well, I can only give this 2 &amp; 1/2 stars. Rent this, but don't buy; I hear the series which this film is based on is way better since there is more time for the story and characters to be developed and seen.",2,Its alright,1033084800,"09 27, 2002",2002,1160,"['action', 'fantasy', 'film', 'story', 'depressed', 'girl', 'who', 'wish', 'granted', 'fade', 'away', 'taken', 'magical', 'world', 'Gaia', 'believed', 'be', 'prophesied', 'Wing', 'Goddess', 'who', 'will', 'save', 'Gaia', 'destroy', 'help', 'dragon', 'armor', 'Escaflowne', 'Battles', 'ensue', '2', 'brothers', 'square', 'where', 'outcome', 'Gaia', 'decided', 'animation', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'human', 'look', 'very', 'flat', 'direction', 'battles', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'exciting', 'story', 'not', 'interesting', 'believable', 'time', 'got', 'end', 'film', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'see', 'what', 'are', 'lot', 'characters', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'Most', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'needed', 'go', 'unexplained', 'undeveloped', 'Only', 'beginning', 'scene', 'final', 'confrontation', 'scene', 'have', 'drama', 'interesting', 'events', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'done', 'well', 'can', 'only', 'give', '2', 'amp', '1/2', 'stars', 'Rent', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'hear', 'series', 'film', 'based', 'way', 'better', 'more', 'time', 'story', 'characters', 'be', 'developed', 'seen']",N/A
