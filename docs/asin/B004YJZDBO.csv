1433316,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,B004YJZDBO,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[0, 0]","Brian Carter has plenty of reasons for his mommy issues.  Growing up as the son of a well-known rehabilitation specialist who then begins to experiments on addicts, while you sit by and watch, that'll mess you up.  So when his mother dies, Brian doesn't bother going to the funeral.  Afterward a letter arrives via his friend Simon, telling Brian the old monastery where his mother first began her work is still standing, and is now his.  Brian says burn it to the ground, but Simon says let's check it out first, there may be some worth to the old place.So Simon gathers a team of people--which consists of Simon, his girlfriend Kimberly, her brother Lucas, his girlfriend Rita and Brian' ex Vicky.  There's also Haley, who meets them at the door and shows them around, giving them a little history on the building while they're at it.  Plus there's  an electrician trying to get the power back on.As expected in a story as formulaic and forgettable as this one, the group slowly splits into smaller groups, which then get picked off by the mysterious creatures lurking inside the building.  Their numbers dwindle until only the survivor is left, and we end with a wink and a grin as it's intimated that quite possibly the danger isn't over.So what I'm saying is, anyone with any kind of working knowledge of the horror genre in film could have finished this script after the first ten pages.  Maybe that's why it's credited to Alan Smithy and Alana Smithy (story by Mariano Baino--you've never heard of him--and Coralina Caraldi-Tassoni--veteran of Argento's OPERA and MOTHER OF TEARS).  But at least it has a director, of sorts.  Antoine Thomas has no directing credits before or after this movie, so make of that what you will.The cast is a who's who of faces you may have seen once or twice, if you looked real close, but no one worth giving special attention to, especially considering the performances.The premise is the real shame here.  Dr. Susan Carter decided to try to make the addictions of the people she treated into a physical being, something that could then be killed.  And, using whatever insane movie logic was at work here, she succeeded.  The addictions then manifested themselves in the physical form of ""babies"" growing inside the addicts.  So far, however, all attempts at excising the creatures resulted in the death of the patients as well.  Except for Breeder 1, Dr. Carter's prize specimen.Oh, and there's also something about a venomous firefly or something, I don't know; I was only halfway paying attention soon after the movie started.Plot holes and logic flaws abound--apparently the building hasn't been used in over ten years, but when the power gets restored, Dr. Carter's computers are running just fine, and one accidental bump of the mouse sets one of her video diaries to playing, which I'm pretty sure is not how computers work--but even before I got to those parts, I could tell right away I wasn't in for anything special.  Even the Netflix description sounds boring.I'm not sure what the impetus was behind the making of HIDDEN 3D, but a quality horror movie wasn't it. The plot structure in unoriginal, the characters are clich&eacute;s, and the lack of honest horror here is astounding.  It was only 81 minutes, but it was a BORING 81 minutes.I can't even give this movie credit as being so bad it's good, because it seems as if the makers were trying to make a serious horror movie, but there were just so many strikes against them from the beginning that, from script to screen, this thing was probably doomed every step of the way.  HIDDEN 3D was boring, predictable, and not even remotely terrifying.

1433319,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B004YJZDBO,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","I knew I was in trouble when I saw ""Directed by M.R."" in the opening credits - it's never a good thing when your director only identifies himself with two initials, especially when those initials aren't even his real ones.  It's even worse when the writers are identified as Alan and Alana Smithee.  (According to the writers, the producers made so many arbitrary changes to the story that they didn't recognize it as their own anymore.)  An hour and a half later, of course, I knew very well why these people didn't want to associate their real names with this film.  Even the title stinks.  Hidden (originally Hidden 3D) - seriously?  You couldn't come up with something better than that, maybe a title that hasn't already been used multiple times already?Brian Carter (Sean Clement) has spent most of his life trying to forget his mad scientist mother, so he isn't exactly torn up inside when she dies.  He is surprised when he learns he has inherited the Divine Sanctuary of Hope, though, as the infamous addiction therapy clinic was supposedly torn down a decade earlier after charges of torture and all-around quackery were directed at his mother.  One of his buddies (who dreams of turning the place of suffering into a ritzy resort) convinces him to at least go and have a look at the place.  It doesn't take long for Brian to stumble upon a super-secret passageway, which leads underground into his mother's real research lab, the one where she conducted her most gruesome experiments.  Hidden features one of the dumbest premises you're likely to find in a horror movie.  The late Dr. Carter's work involved the transformation of addictions into distinct cellular bodies, which could then be excised like cancer cells.  Poof - no more addiction.  Unfortunately, her tests on human subjects didn't stop there.The whole basis of this story is laughable, and there's absolutely no suspense or tension as the utterly predictable events play out.  There's also no blood or gore to speak of.  Next to no character development also means you won't really care what happens to any of these people.  It all adds up to a formula for banality, which will have you thinking that the one thing that should have stayed hidden was Hidden itself.",2,Stupid and boring,1356134400,"12 22, 2012",2012,2240,"['knew', 'was', 'trouble', 'when', 'saw', 'Directed', 'M.R', 'opening', 'never', 'good', 'thing', 'when', 'director', 'only', 'two', 'initials', 'especially', 'when', 'initials', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'real', 'ones', 'even', 'worse', 'when', 'writers', 'are', 'identified', 'Alan', 'Alana', 'Smithee', 'According', 'writers', 'producers', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'arbitrary', 'changes', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'own', 'anymore', 'hour', 'half', 'later', 'course', 'knew', 'very', 'well', 'why', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'associate', 'real', 'names', 'film', 'Even', 'title', 'stinks', 'Hidden', 'originally', 'Hidden', '3D', 'seriously', 'could', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'something', 'better', 'maybe', 'title', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'used', 'multiple', 'times', 'already', 'Brian', 'Carter', 'Sean', 'Clement', 'spent', 'most', 'life', 'trying', 'forget', 'mad', 'scientist', 'mother', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'torn', 'up', 'when', 'surprised', 'when', 'inherited', 'Divine', 'Sanctuary', 'Hope', 'though', 'infamous', 'addiction', 'therapy', 'clinic', 'was', 'supposedly', 'torn', 'down', 'decade', 'earlier', 'charges', 'torture', 'all-around', 'quackery', 'were', 'directed', 'mother', 'One', 'buddies', 'who', 'turning', 'place', 'suffering', 'ritzy', 'resort', 'least', 'go', 'have', 'look', 'place', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'Brian', 'stumble', 'super-secret', 'passageway', 'underground', 'mother', 'real', 'research', 'lab', 'one', 'where', 'conducted', 'most', 'gruesome', 'experiments', 'Hidden', 'one', 'dumbest', 'premises', ""'re"", 'likely', 'find', 'horror', 'movie', 'late', 'Dr.', 'Carter', 'work', 'involved', 'transformation', 'addictions', 'distinct', 'cellular', 'bodies', 'could', 'then', 'be', 'excised', 'cancer', 'cells', 'Poof', 'more', 'addiction', 'Unfortunately', 'tests', 'human', 'subjects', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there.The', 'whole', 'basis', 'story', 'laughable', 'absolutely', 'suspense', 'tension', 'utterly', 'predictable', 'events', 'play', 'out', 'also', 'blood', 'gore', 'speak', 'Next', 'character', 'development', 'also', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'what', 'people', 'up', 'formula', 'banality', 'will', 'have', 'thinking', 'one', 'thing', 'should', 'have', 'stayed', 'hidden', 'was', 'Hidden']",Hidden Reino Unido
1433320,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004YJZDBO,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Let's start with a compliment, sort of. The low-budget endeavor ""Hidden"" has got to have one of the most patently ridiculous premises that I've ever seen. It is so wacky, it is almost irresistible. If you give it any serious thought (and I won't spoil it), it makes your head start to explode. How convoluted is it? The screenplay relies on the most insane method of trying to make sense of it for the audience. At two points in the movie, a computer turns itself on to have a filmed segment explain exactly what we need to know. Huh? Pretty convenient, if not incredibly sloppy and lazy. And it still doesn't make sense! The movie is filled with junk science, venomous insects, mad experiments, and dangerous addictions. It is simultaneously about all of these things and none of these things. If the movie had embraced its lunacy, it might have made for a fun guilty pleasure (still incomprehensible, but fun). As is, though, the movie plays it straight and we're left with a drab and expected narrative.Sean Clement plays the son of a revolutionary, but controversial, addiction treatment doctor. When his mother dies, he is left an old monastery (of course) where she used to do her work. Naturally, he and seven other people venture off to this remote estate to check it out. Even though it has modern renovations, it isn't accessible by road? Even though the building is immense and unoccupied, all the research was done in tunnels underneath the main building? What a waste of space! None of the characters gets much development, it's not really necessary. As anticipated, they start to get separated in increasingly preposterous ways (I particularly enjoyed the couple who ran off right away to have dank basement sex). You guessed it, there is an unseen danger lurking and our crew starts being eliminated one by one. This is essentially just a variation on an abandoned insane asylum or haunted house thriller that you've seen hundreds of times.The environment itself is creepy and a few visual effects are nice, but it's hard to muster much enthusiasm for anything else. Who will survive? More to the point, will you care? As we get to the dramatic conclusion, this really shifts into mad scientist territory like from a B-grade fifties film. But even this is so anticlimactic and silly! Listen, I love bad movie mayhem. But ""Hidden"" begs us to take it seriously as a horror offering when it so clearly should have played up the campy insanity inherent in its own fantastically ridiculous plot! As is, though, it wastes the only thing that might have distinguished it from all of the other films exactly like it. Not good, but more detrimental--not fun either.

And then lo and behold I saw this one! Although to be honest, the original title was ""Hidden 3D"" which for some strange reason the producers dropped the ""3D"" which I thought was odd considering the high quality of ""Valentine's Day 3D.""There isn't much of a mystery as the beginning explains everything. Susan Carter (Dawn Ford) runs a mental institution called ""Divine Sanctuary of Hope."" She has created a machine called ""Ventris"" because Tetras was already taken. It cures mental addiction. It injects a venom into the brain from an insect that looks like a BA CG lightning bug. The addiction then manifests itself as an infant growing inside the person like a tumor, but as Arnold would say, ""It's not a tumor."" No womb required.When Susan dies, her heavy drinking son Brian (Sean Clement) inherits the place in spite of the fact he disliked his own mother. He takes a crew out to the old abandoned place including crusty Chester (Allan Kolman) who is the person movies cast when Donald Sutherland won't accept the role. Considering the low quality of roles Sutherland has taken here of late, this should be a sign as to the quality of this film.We already know there is a creature running around killing people (it shows us) and if you've ever watched a horror movie before, you know the rest of the overly predictable plot.Brian's friend Simon (Jason Blicker) has big resort plans for this snowy isolated establishment. Brian wants to demolish the building. The mutants are MST comical and I was laughing at scenes that were supposed to scare you. On the MST scale: 3 stars. Great movie to show kids who want to catch fireflies.No f-bombs that I recall, no sex, no nudity.

1433326,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B004YJZDBO,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[2, 2]","""Hidden"" starts with an interesting premise.  After the death of his mother, Brian Karter (Sean Clement) learns that he has inherited ""The Sanctuary,"" home to her experimental addiction treatment center.  During a tour of the decrepit facility, Brian and his friends uncover a terrible secret.  Hidden in the bowels of the abandoned building there exists a revolutionary machine capable of curing any addiction, but only at a terrifying price -- the manifestation of mutant offspring, hungry for flesh.Even though ""Hidden"" is a low-budget horror flick, it breaks new ground for dopiness.  It overexplains what should be left unstated.  When there's too much explanation of how and why things are happening, the danger is sounding dumb.  That's what happens here.  Cliches abound, from the remote setting, cheap shocks, characters who insist on venturing off into danger, and assorted inevitable deaths.Essentially a ""Shutter Island"" wannabe, ""Hidden"" is a pedestiran effort.

1433327,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B004YJZDBO,Tony Heck,"[0, 0]","""Some may see blasphemy where I see nothing short of a miracle."" After the death of his mother and controversial scientist, Brian (Clement) is left to take care of the hospital where she worked. Going in with the intent to sell it, him and his friends soon discover hidden horrors that threaten not only the sale but their lives. For some reason a new sub-genre of horror movies has begun...the movie set in an insane asylum/hospital. After watching about ten of this new category in the last few years I have to wonder how long they will keep it going. While there has been a few good ones (Waking Madison & The Ward) the rest are pretty forgettable. This one falls into the later. If you are a hardcore horror fan and have to watch all of them then this is one to check out. If like me you watch them and wonder why you do then I can say skip this one. Overall, it could have been worse, but it's also not really original either. I say C.",2,A movie in a new type of sub-genre that is already getting repetitive. Could have been worse but not that good.
