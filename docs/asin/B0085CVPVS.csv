1546691,ARWRQ25FP49NE,B0085CVPVS,John Freedman,"[0, 0]","Season Two of Ice Pilots continues the exploits of Buffalo Airways. It is great viewing watching young pilots operate WW2 piston transports in blizzard conditions. I love watching these old warbirds in action, as well as the dramas of living in arctic conditions, as well as operating a small airline. Mikey is still Mikey, Joe is still Joe and all that comes with it. There is great flying, interesting characters, and plenty of adventure.If you want entertainment, interesting adventures and like aviation, then Ice Pilots is for you.",5,"Another great season of ""Icecapades""",1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,536,"['Season', 'Two', 'Ice', 'Pilots', 'exploits', 'Buffalo', 'Airways', 'great', 'viewing', 'watching', 'young', 'pilots', 'operate', 'WW2', 'piston', 'transports', 'blizzard', 'conditions', 'love', 'watching', 'old', 'warbirds', 'action', 'as', 'well', 'dramas', 'living', 'arctic', 'conditions', 'as', 'well', 'operating', 'small', 'airline', 'Mikey', 'still', 'Mikey', 'Joe', 'still', 'Joe', 'great', 'flying', 'interesting', 'characters', 'plenty', 'adventure.If', 'want', 'entertainment', 'interesting', 'adventures', 'aviation', 'then', 'Ice', 'Pilots']",Ice Pilots NWT - Season Two - 3 DVD set
1546692,A1MPPAKA7VJO3P,B0085CVPVS,Pop culture man,"[1, 1]","This is simply superb viewing for anyone who loves big, old aircraft. The planes are beautifully filmed: from other aircraft while in the air, from within the cockpits, and on the ground. The glorious scenery of the North West Territories provides a stunning backdrop for the piston-engined workhorses. There are many scenes you will want to replay time and time again, so stirring is the photography of the great, old planes.The directors (three are credited) clearly understand what aviation buffs want to see and the camera lingers lovingly on the planes from every angle, particular attention given to the  rugged engines. You can't help but love these sixty year-old veterans: DC 3s, C 46s, and a DC 4. A comparative youngster, a turbine-powered Electra, also appears in some episodes.Around the planes, each episode presents stories about the people of Buffalo Airways and how they interact act with each other as they cope with a variety of issues arising from the airline's operations. While initially I was impatient with this human interest content interrupting photography of the planes, I have come to enjoy this material too. The men and women seem at times to be unaware of the cameras and emotions flow freely in response to the pressures and problems that arise. You come to understand the characters and look forward to seeing them featured in the stories, be they the boss of the airline, his two sons in management roles, or the pilots, 'rampies', mechanics and cargo managers who work so hard in the harsh conditions. And you never have to wait too long before the camera takes you back to the aircraft.This is stunning stuff.",5,Great planes beautifully filmed,1362096000,"03 1, 2013",2013,1646,"['simply', 'superb', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'who', 'big', 'old', 'aircraft', 'planes', 'are', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'other', 'aircraft', 'air', 'cockpits', 'ground', 'glorious', 'scenery', 'North', 'West', 'Territories', 'stunning', 'backdrop', 'piston-engined', 'workhorses', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'will', 'want', 'replay', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'stirring', 'photography', 'great', 'old', 'planes.The', 'directors', 'three', 'are', 'credited', 'clearly', 'understand', 'what', 'aviation', 'buffs', 'want', 'see', 'camera', 'lovingly', 'planes', 'angle', 'particular', 'attention', 'given', 'rugged', 'engines', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'sixty', 'year-old', 'veterans', 'DC', '3s', 'C', '46s', 'DC', '4', 'comparative', 'youngster', 'turbine-powered', 'Electra', 'also', 'planes', 'episode', 'stories', 'people', 'Buffalo', 'Airways', 'how', 'interact', 'act', 'other', 'cope', 'variety', 'issues', 'arising', 'airline', 'operations', 'initially', 'was', 'impatient', 'human', 'interest', 'content', 'interrupting', 'photography', 'planes', 'have', 'come', 'enjoy', 'material', 'too', 'men', 'women', 'seem', 'times', 'be', 'unaware', 'cameras', 'emotions', 'flow', 'freely', 'response', 'pressures', 'problems', 'arise', 'come', 'understand', 'characters', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'featured', 'stories', 'be', 'boss', 'airline', 'two', 'sons', 'management', 'roles', 'pilots', ""'rampies"", 'mechanics', 'cargo', 'managers', 'who', 'work', 'so', 'hard', 'harsh', 'conditions', 'never', 'have', 'wait', 'too', 'long', 'camera', 'back', 'aircraft.This', 'stunning', 'stuff']",Ice Pilots NWT - Season Two - 3 DVD set
