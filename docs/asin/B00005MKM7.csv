665835,A1OZEX6BNJEDBM,B00005MKM7,"A. Barry ""THE reviewer""","[9, 20]","It really is sad to see Phills Reynold Naylor's great masterpiece about a beagle puppy trampled on like this.  This film was not at all faithful to the book.  The first difference is that in the book Shiloh had a black spot just behind his left ear about one inch in front of his leg.  In the movie, the spot is way over on his back!  In the book, Shiloh's tail was a couple inches long.  In the movie, it's like a foot!The classic ""this little piggy goes to market"" scene has been ommitted, and scene where Shiloh tries to hump the kid's leg was just plain unneccesary. C'mon, this is supposed to be a family movie!  Avoid this and read the fantastic book trilogy instead(which I also wrote a comprehensive review for)",1,A bad film adaptation of a great book,1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,719,"['really', 'sad', 'see', 'Phills', 'Reynold', 'Naylor', 'great', 'masterpiece', 'beagle', 'puppy', 'trampled', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'faithful', 'book', 'first', 'difference', 'book', 'Shiloh', 'had', 'black', 'spot', 'just', 'left', 'ear', 'one', 'inch', 'front', 'leg', 'movie', 'spot', 'way', 'back', 'book', 'Shiloh', 'tail', 'was', 'couple', 'inches', 'long', 'movie', 'foot', 'classic', 'little', 'piggy', 'market', 'scene', 'been', 'ommitted', 'scene', 'where', 'Shiloh', 'hump', 'kid', 'leg', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'unneccesary', ""C'mon"", 'supposed', 'be', 'family', 'movie', 'Avoid', 'read', 'fantastic', 'book', 'trilogy', 'instead', 'also', 'wrote', 'comprehensive', 'review']",N/A
665836,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005MKM7,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Shiloh is a movie about a beautiful beagel puppy that's caught between two neighbors.  The owner that treats the dog like crap is determined to make a hunting dog out of him, however the neighbors right down the hill would rather the beagle puppy live where he will surely be loved and appreciated, which, of course, is with them.The storyline focuses around the friendly, dog-loving family insisting they will take care of the dog and accept him with open arms, but the mean ol' nasty neighbor has other plans.  It's *his* dog after all- he's the one who paid good money for it.  He won't just give it up so easily.  So what happens?Well, since Shiloh is mostly a family presentation, this movie is not an example of brutal violence or revenge between two neighbors.  Instead, it's about some simple folks living out in the country and settling disputes amongst themselves with *zero* regard for the actual legal system.  This makes for interesting storytelling because it actually shows human beings reacting fairly reasonably (or unreasonably) towards each other in an an attempt to figure out what exactly to do with the dog.I say it's ""mostly"" a family movie because it is... for the most part.  The segments that I absolutely *detest* are the ones that show the scruffy neighbor actually kicking the beagle.  Kicking the dog is horrendous enough, but to do it in front of his neighbors really REALLY rubbed me the wrong way.  It showed a complete lack of respect and appreciation for animals.  I didn't like those particular scenes at all.You may have also noticed that I said the neighbors react ""fairly reasonably"" with each other.  I'm mostly basing this off assumptions that people living in the country and away from having to rely on police officers and whatnot would KNOW right from wrong and would be able to settle disputes in a mature and reasonble manner.  Obviously there's some fiction here because it's entirely possible two neighbors wouldn't have the decency to communicate with each other maturely, leading to unnecessary fighting soon after.  I realize this.  For the most part, the mean neighbor isn't *that* mean (besides of course, the kicking- ugh!)Anyway, for a low budget family movie the acting is REALLY strong, especially from the little blonde-haired boy who plays lead role.  His character is absolutely awesome.  He's just a kid and acts like more of a man than most people who ARE grown men!I highly recommend it.  Just try not to cringe at the beagle kicking scenes because anyone who loves dogs will absolutely hate these parts, and justifiably so.",5,so much joy,1312329600,"08 3, 2011",2011,2587,"['Shiloh', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'beagel', 'puppy', 'caught', 'two', 'neighbors', 'owner', 'dog', 'crap', 'determined', 'make', 'hunting', 'dog', 'however', 'neighbors', 'right', 'hill', 'would', 'rather', 'beagle', 'puppy', 'live', 'where', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'loved', 'appreciated', 'course', 'them.The', 'storyline', 'friendly', 'dog-loving', 'family', 'insisting', 'will', 'take', 'care', 'dog', 'accept', 'open', 'arms', 'mean', 'ol', 'nasty', 'neighbor', 'other', 'plans', '*his*', 'dog', 'all-', 'one', 'who', 'paid', 'good', 'money', 'wo', ""n't"", 'just', 'give', 'up', 'so', 'easily', 'what', 'Well', 'Shiloh', 'mostly', 'family', 'presentation', 'movie', 'not', 'example', 'brutal', 'violence', 'revenge', 'two', 'neighbors', 'Instead', 'simple', 'folks', 'living', 'out', 'country', 'settling', 'disputes', 'amongst', '*zero*', 'regard', 'actual', 'legal', 'system', 'interesting', 'storytelling', 'actually', 'human', 'beings', 'reacting', 'fairly', 'reasonably', 'unreasonably', 'towards', 'other', 'attempt', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'exactly', 'do', 'dog.I', 'say', 'mostly', 'family', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'segments', 'absolutely', 'are', 'ones', 'show', 'scruffy', 'neighbor', 'actually', 'kicking', 'beagle', 'Kicking', 'dog', 'horrendous', 'enough', 'do', 'front', 'neighbors', 'really', 'REALLY', 'rubbed', 'wrong', 'way', 'showed', 'complete', 'lack', 'respect', 'appreciation', 'animals', 'did', ""n't"", 'particular', 'scenes', 'all.You', 'may', 'have', 'also', 'noticed', 'said', 'neighbors', 'react', 'fairly', 'reasonably', 'other', ""'m"", 'mostly', 'basing', 'off', 'assumptions', 'people', 'living', 'country', 'away', 'having', 'rely', 'police', 'officers', 'whatnot', 'would', 'KNOW', 'right', 'wrong', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'settle', 'disputes', 'mature', 'reasonble', 'manner', 'Obviously', 'fiction', 'here', 'entirely', 'possible', 'two', 'neighbors', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'decency', 'communicate', 'other', 'maturely', 'leading', 'unnecessary', 'fighting', 'soon', 'realize', 'most', 'part', 'mean', 'neighbor', ""n't"", '*that*', 'mean', 'course', 'kicking-', 'ugh', 'Anyway', 'low', 'budget', 'family', 'movie', 'acting', 'REALLY', 'strong', 'especially', 'little', 'blonde-haired', 'boy', 'who', 'lead', 'role', 'character', 'absolutely', 'awesome', 'just', 'kid', 'acts', 'more', 'man', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'ARE', 'grown', 'men', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Just', 'try', 'not', 'cringe', 'beagle', 'kicking', 'scenes', 'anyone', 'who', 'dogs', 'will', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'parts', 'justifiably', 'so']",N/A

I found the movie to be pleasant and enjoyable. The roles were all convincingly played and I found myself really mad at the Scott Wilson character, Judd Travers; Wilson did a great job at being a despicable villain. The other major and supporting roles are well cast and played by seasoned actors and actresses which contribute to the overall ambience of the movie.Blake Heron plays the part of Marty Preston, our stories hero, and is convincing as the young lad who falls in love with a dog. The dog is in trouble and turns to Marty for help; Marty reacts to the need and decides the dog is his responsibility.

665838,AY12DBB0U420B,B00005MKM7,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","My bargain-rack movie for last night was ""Shiloh,"" a story of a boy and a dog. Okay, it's a bit out of the ordinary for me but one needs a few changes from time to time. Shiloh was a beagle belonging to a scumbag hunter and he was treated badly under the guise of training him. The little dog got away and was gradually befriended by a young boy. Of course, the boy's parents made him return the dog but a bond had been created and the dog kept returning. The hunter had given his dogs designations of 1, 2, 3, and so on, and it was the little boy who had given him the name of Shiloh after where he was found. In any case, we're dealing with a boy-dog love bond here and the boy was willing to work hard at manual labor in order to buy the dog from the hunter. All seemed to be going well, until the hunter reneged on the deal and the boy was stripped of his beloved dog after all of his work. Of course, it ended happily, but I won't get into that except to say that the ending was rather a letdown.The movie is easy going and something that could be enjoyed by everyone in the family. Cruelty and harsh language are soft peddled. Everything has rounded corners and would not be offensive to anyone. The kids in the movie come across as pretty good believable actors. The parents and other adults are unbelievably old fashioned, but in a good sense. The scumbag hunter is, well, a scumbag and he has the best acting of the movie. It's a pleasant, lightweight movie that doesn't cut too deeply but might bring a few sniffles from the kids. I recently viewed another boy-dog movie, ""Lassie, Come Home,"" and I'd rate it as far superior in story, acting and emotional content., This is a fine movie, however, especially for the younger set.Gary Peterson",4,"A Fine Movie, But Doesn't Cut Very Deeply.",1339977600,"06 18, 2012",2012,1751,"['bargain-rack', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'Shiloh', 'story', 'boy', 'dog', 'Okay', 'bit', 'ordinary', 'one', 'few', 'changes', 'time', 'time', 'Shiloh', 'was', 'beagle', 'belonging', 'scumbag', 'hunter', 'was', 'treated', 'badly', 'guise', 'training', 'little', 'dog', 'got', 'away', 'was', 'gradually', 'befriended', 'young', 'boy', 'course', 'boy', 'parents', 'made', 'return', 'dog', 'bond', 'had', 'been', 'created', 'dog', 'kept', 'returning', 'hunter', 'had', 'given', 'dogs', 'designations', '1', '2', '3', 'so', 'was', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'had', 'given', 'name', 'Shiloh', 'where', 'was', 'found', 'case', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'boy-dog', 'love', 'bond', 'here', 'boy', 'was', 'willing', 'work', 'hard', 'manual', 'labor', 'order', 'buy', 'dog', 'hunter', 'seemed', 'be', 'going', 'well', 'hunter', 'reneged', 'deal', 'boy', 'was', 'stripped', 'beloved', 'dog', 'work', 'course', 'ended', 'happily', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'say', 'ending', 'was', 'rather', 'letdown.The', 'movie', 'easy', 'going', 'something', 'could', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'everyone', 'family', 'Cruelty', 'harsh', 'language', 'are', 'soft', 'peddled', 'Everything', 'rounded', 'corners', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'offensive', 'anyone', 'kids', 'movie', 'come', 'pretty', 'good', 'believable', 'actors', 'parents', 'other', 'adults', 'are', 'unbelievably', 'old', 'fashioned', 'good', 'sense', 'scumbag', 'hunter', 'well', 'scumbag', 'best', 'acting', 'movie', 'pleasant', 'lightweight', 'movie', ""n't"", 'cut', 'too', 'deeply', 'might', 'bring', 'few', 'sniffles', 'kids', 'recently', 'viewed', 'boy-dog', 'movie', 'Lassie', 'Come', 'Home', ""'d"", 'rate', 'far', 'superior', 'story', 'acting', 'emotional', 'content.', 'fine', 'movie', 'however', 'especially', 'younger', 'set.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A
