57239,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0783226926,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Arnold Schwarzenegger is unintentionally and quite awkwardly hilarious in this middle brow comedy that has some heart and not enough brains to make it worth all your time.  Still, watching Arnold oaf his way through his lines with a commendable sincerity (he's really, really trying) is unexpectedly rewarding and fun.The story is bizarre.  Arnold plays a genetically engineered child who was born and raised in a lab.  Danny DeVito plays his twin brother, a troublesome character who did not receive the same genetic altering and thus grew up to be a pretty terrible guy.  Arnold finds out he has a brother and searches for him only to find a pudgy creep who doesn't want anything to do with him.  Throw in a hitman and the search for their long lost mother and you have a buddy comedy that feels slightly detached and under-developed.  The girlfriend angle was unnecessary and unbelievable to the hilt, but then again this story itself is just poorly conceived.Still, DeVito is funny and Schwarzenegger is unintentionally so.

57241,ALR35EFI69S5R,0783226926,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[14, 16]","With this movie Arnold Schwarzenegger showed just how long those muscular legs are in terms of talent, range, and intelligence. This is a wry, wistful, and lovely movie that illustrates how easily Schwarzenegger could switch gears from the heavy action-oriented vehicles that had made him a star to more sentimental and purposeful films that intentionally made audiences both laugh and think. Indeed, hidden in all this well-choreographed slapstick is a self-deprecating kind of intelligent humor no one suspected the big guy to be capable of.  Matched memorably with Danny Devito as the twin trapped with all the bad genetics even as Schwarzenegger ended up with the great genes and the life associated with it, the two work off each other in a movie so funny it is hard to try to describe.Every thing about the sequences works, from Arnie's nave wonder with all the new experiences to his ear-phoned airplane accompaniment to ""Yackety-Yak"".  Watching him do something as straightforward as walking down the street in suit coat and Bermuda shorts becomes an exercise in comic genius, with both the scriptwriters and director Ivan Reitman working overtime to create this comic masterpiece.  Devito is in rare form, and we find ourselves empathizing with this guy who discovers he came from the throwaway sperm that was used to create his brother, the wunderkind. No wonder his life has been a virtual wallowing in the wastelands! Yet from the first meeting there seems to be an almost magical connection between the twin brothers, and Reitman has scrupulously given us a repertoire of little aspects or facets of each that lend credibility to this idea of a familial bond.This movie ensured Schwarzenegger's wider appeal to audiences beyond the action and sci-fi genre. Indeed, he repeated the comedic magic a few years later with ""Kindergarten Cop"", which while not as phenomenal a hit as was ""Twins"" was also an interesting diversion from what one would ordinarily come to expect from an Arnold epic.  Also helping here is a strong supporting cast; including Kelly Preston as Arnie's love interest and Chloe Webb as Devito's enduring girl friend. This is a movie so full of rapid fire comic scenes such as the quick shot at Sylvester Stallone's self-conscious muscle-man pose poster for Rambo II that one recognizes the good-natured jibe at an action-star rival as all in good humor; Arnie and Sly were said to be at odds with each other at the time.  And this is a movie the whole family can laugh at, and while there are some adult situations, there is not much blue language or objectionable behavior for a parent to worry about.  I can highly recommend this film.

Why the surprise?  Because I never dreamed &quot;Ahnold&quot; could hold his own in a comedic role.  But the Austrian muscle man creates laughs as easily as he bashes heads together, and TWINS remains a perennial favorite of mine.As ridiculous as the plot is (Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito are the products of genetic engineering gone awry), this movie succeeds because of the chemistry between the two actors.  It's more than obvious to the viewer that Arnold and DeVito had a blast making this movie, from the action scenes to the way the actors mimic one another to create the &quot;twins&quot; effect.  It's all great fun to watch, and the timing between the two is pure bliss.The movie's tender moments are overly sappy--yet still very effective (especially DeVito's character), and the scrumptious Kelly Preston strikes one of the most memorable poses in all of cinematic history.

They got seperated at birth, one was raised on an island to just read books and to not really know anything about the real world. He's played by Arnold. When he finds out he has a twin he sets out to find him and he's pretty naive when he arrives in the U.S. When he finds his twin played by Danny Devito, he's surprised to see that they look nothing alike. Since he's naive, he doesn't see that his brother isn't really a nice person. He gets Arnold to bail him out of prison and flat leaves him since he doesn't believe the twin story.After awhile the 2 bond in some funny scenes with them dressing alike and Danny giving him some advice about women and how to dance. Those are funny and sweet scenes but the film has a subplot where there's million of dollars involved and a bad guy killing people. So the violent side of plot isn't needed. It gives the film the excuse to have a road trip though. Arnold thinks it's to find their real mom when it's really for the money. Still though, Devito and Arnold make an odd but fun team and even manage to make Junior work when they worked together again. I mean it's about Arnold having a baby for god's sake...lol.

There was a lot of 'unsavoury' language cut out, and sometimes, even full jokes! I didn't recognise half of the early scenes when Julius & Vincent are in Vincent's house, as there's bits about Julius still being a virgin at 35 (and I thought I was a late starter!)Arnie & Danny Devito are a great comedic pairing in this movie, Danny tall as he is wide, and Arnie showing off his muscles. They also starred together in Junior, which, despite what one reviewer said, is NOT a sequel to this!The poster is enough to tell if you'll like this or not. If you think the casting of Arnie and Danny is amusing as a little and large combo then you'll probably like this. If you think it dumb then you may not appreciate this. The comedy is very much a mix of odd-couple and fish-out-of-water style jokes from Julius as opposed to the streetwise Vincent. The plot is largely meaningless - a mix of the two taking a secret engine across country while looking for their mother, and throw in two pretty girls (Chloe Webb & John Travolta's future wife, Kelly Preston).All the fish-out-of-water jokes are funny, but sometimes not laugh out loud hilarious. It works mainly due to the casting of the lead two. Danny plays the sleazy one very well but the best one is Arnie - he merely plays a big nave lump of muscle. However what he does do is allow himself to be sent up very well - you have to look out for it in most of his movies now, he always sends himself up somehow! Whether it be him making little knowing jokes (`I'll be back' or comparing muscles with Stallone on his Rambo poster) or just being the straightman to DeVito's set up jokes.This is a great movie, although it's practically sacriledge that it's a full-screen edition, and has no extras. The film starts straight away, no main menu, and also has a little bit at the start where it says that English is the chosen language for this DVD, you can choose your own language later! Or have the subtitles on. Junior is not as good, mainly because it has the very annoying woman in it, who's name escapes me at the moment. You know, the annoying blonde one.

The filmmakers exploited that to the best of their abilities and we got a pretty darn good film out of their efforts...though I wouldn't refer to the two leading men as ""comedians"" in any such context.  Reunited after several decades of separation, twins Julius (Schwarzenegger) and Vincent (DeVito) Benedict set out to find the woman who was the ""mother"" in the lab experiment that created them...and unbeknownst to Julius, Vincent wants to deliver a stolen engine to a buyer in Texas....an engine that a ruthless hit man is looking to get back by any means necessary.  While Schwarzenegger and DeVito were pretty funny (above average for Schwarzenegger and classic DeVito), the hit man was my favorite.  He was not your stereotypical bad guy at the time and Marshall Bell brought out the ""geek"" in him.  Sadly it's something many media have now tried to create a stereotype of...all attempts have failed.  Seriously though, what hit man before this has ever talked about his ""driving hat"" and ""driving gloves"" before?

I was a little disappointed.The story itself holds a lot of promise and Danny DeVito and Chloe Webb perform spectacularly.  The story is a well-woven tale of a family separated at birth.The twins played by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito are the product of a Los Alamos experiment to create the most genetically advanced human being ever by mixing the genetics of several of the world's top performers in various professions from sports to science.  The egg splits during incubation and all the good genes go into Julius (Arnold) and all the rest of the garbage goes into Vincent (DeVito).  Julius is whisked away to a South Pacific paradise where he is given all the love, care, and education he can handle.  He is told that his mother had died in childbirth.  Vincent, on the other hand, is tossed away to an orphanage and told that his mother had abandoned him.  Their mother, played passably by Bonnie Bartlett, was told that both sons died after birth.The twins set out to find their mother in the hopes of putting the family back together.  The main obstacles in their way are Vincent's criminal associates hounding them, the head of the experiment who is unwilling to help them, and their own disbelief in the veracity of the whole broken family story.The twins complement each other well.  Julius is a case of booksmarts, and Vincent is well-schooled in street smarts.  Vincent has no faith in others, but Julius shows him how to open himself up to family.  It's very touching in certain scenes.However, two performances were not up to par.  The first is Kelly Preston's portrayal of Marnie was bad.  We get no sense of her as a real character, only as a sexpot lusting after Julius.  She brings no depth to the character of Marnie, and despite her judicious flaunting of her 'talents' she comes across as nothing more than background noise.Arnold's playing of Julius is likewise flawed, but more because of his lack of experience playing in a non-action movie.  His best scenes are when he is lifting, breaking, throwing, or generally doing muscle-work.  The portrayal of Julius really suffers when Arnold is trying to emote or appear intellectual.  Still, Arnold is doing his best, and this is still one of his first comedic roles, so he gets cut some slack.I liked this movie when I first saw it years ago.  I don't know if I liked it that much when I saw it more recently.  Everything seems to be put together well, but something rubbed me the wrong way.

Usually, we stick to the letter of B law, but we are going to be going outside the box a little more. This starts with Twins. This is a film that was very successful, even topping the box office for a few weeks upon its release in 1988. Normally, we would never touch such a movie, but this one had a lot going for it. Most notably, Arnold, and the very basic principle of B, it was loaded with unintentional comedy.Mostly everyone has seen Twins, or at least knows the story. Arnold was the product of a genetic experiment to create the perfect man. Devito was all the crap that was left over. They end up finding each other, their mom, and love. They also fall into some cash through the Les Diamond-like business practices of DeVito and start a consulting firm. Sid found himself making fun of roughly 85% of this movie, which is a great ratio even for us.Needless to say, Sid totally dug this flick. How could we not? It was Arnold! The scenes in which Devito, a 4'11 long lost Sid relative from the North Pole area, acted like a big timer were priceless. They were all in the same class as the scene when Arnold was walking by a movie theater, sees a Rambo poster, then flexes his massive guns and laughs at Sly's puniness. Speaking of Arnold's guns, look for a review ofPumping Iron (25th Anniversary Special Edition)from Sid soon. As for Twins, we would have and did enjoy this one many times in our youth. Many times.

57289,AJDYDG7YZY9QL,0783226926,Stephen A. Haines,"[3, 4]","When Arnold Schwarzenegger turned to comedy, he did Hollywood [and us viewers] a truly  worthy service.  He carries the comedy role with real panache, a pleasantly surprising  transformation from an actor who previously seemed to offer little but skin and violence.  With many films now available with him in this transformed personification, we have a wide  choice to select from.  Select this one.The film is certainly timely with its theme of &quot;human engineering&quot;, even if from an earlier  day.  Schwarzenegger leaves his island isolation, seeking the twin he never knew he had.  He  has no qualms in discovering DeVito's only a diminutive copy of himself.  He's concerned  only that he actually has a brother and wants only to do well by him.  DeVito, in sublime  scenes of righteous rage, feels a leftover, and in tune with what many short people go through  in our society, seeks some justice for what he feels has been done to him.  DeVito's anger is  unabashed, and only he could bring the charm and wit to the role that he does.Twins not only shows this new side of Arnold at his wry best, he's here teamed with a master  in Danny DeVito.  DeVito needs no introduction as one of Hollywood's top comic actors.  In  playing the unexpected twin to a genetic engineering [whell, &quot;breeding&quot;] experiment, he once  again proves how well he carries the genre as his own.  It must have been an easy job for  Reitman to direct this film, since DeVito seems able to perform many aspects of the ridiculous  with a minimum of effort.This household has viewed Twins often.  There was no choice once the children had seen it.  No matter, to see these two in action together relieves the worst tedium.

Vincent becomes the ultimate low life and is about to be killed by loan sharks when Julius discovers that he has a brother and begins looking for him. The mismatched duo of Schwarzenegger and DeVito work to perfection in this hilarious comedy. A nice entertaining movie that serves its purpose well.,5,Twins,1264204800,"01 23, 2010",2010,620,"['Julius', 'Vincent', 'Benedict', 'are', 'results', 'experiment', 'would', 'allow', 'perfect', 'child', 'Julius', 'was', 'planned', 'athletic', 'proportions', 'Vincent', 'accident', 'somewhat', 'smaller', 'stature', 'Vincent', 'placed', 'orphanage', 'Julius', 'taken', 'south', 'seas', 'island', 'raised', 'philosophers', 'Vincent', 'ultimate', 'low', 'life', 'be', 'killed', 'loan', 'sharks', 'when', 'Julius', 'brother', 'looking', 'mismatched', 'duo', 'Schwarzenegger', 'DeVito', 'work', 'perfection', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'nice', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'purpose', 'well']",N/A
