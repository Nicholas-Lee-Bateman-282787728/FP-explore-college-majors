884315,AQUU8S55JGY2H,B0007OCG4W,Aco,"[3, 3]","Having quickly become a modern classic on stage and in acting circles, Closer-the film is also a landmark.Thirty years removed from Carnal Knowledge, Mike Nichols deftly guides this present day expose of how men and women damage each other in relationships, how impulse and instinct conflict with emotion and the heart, truly the ultimate of matters for us all.The acting is stellar, in particular Portman and Owen (both nominated for Academy Awards) as the initial foils for their partners Law and Roberts, respectively. But these are equal opportunity betrayals, put over on each other over the course of four years. The use of Damien Rice's ""O,"" the direction by Nichols, and the film adapted screenplay by the play's writer/creator Patrick Marber are also excellent.This isn't remotely a comedy, despite moments of levity-particularly Owen-and is a sad case for the complexity of cosmopolitan culture and attitude, an absence of obescense and perspective other than whimsy and vengeance-traits that usually result in damage, especially in relationships.Such an expose, an introspection, an analysis makes this the standout it is. This will hold up over time too, because simple, direct subjects, like how and why and what happens when people struggle against each other in intimate relationships, is a subject that will never be tired.",5,This is going to hurt.,1144713600,"04 11, 2006",2006,1339,"['Having', 'quickly', 'become', 'modern', 'classic', 'stage', 'acting', 'circles', 'Closer-the', 'film', 'also', 'landmark.Thirty', 'years', 'removed', 'Carnal', 'Knowledge', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'deftly', 'present', 'day', 'expose', 'how', 'men', 'women', 'damage', 'other', 'relationships', 'how', 'impulse', 'instinct', 'conflict', 'emotion', 'heart', 'truly', 'ultimate', 'matters', 'all.The', 'acting', 'stellar', 'particular', 'Portman', 'Owen', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'initial', 'foils', 'partners', 'Law', 'Roberts', 'respectively', 'are', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'betrayals', 'put', 'over', 'other', 'course', 'four', 'years', 'use', 'Damien', 'Rice', 'O', 'direction', 'Nichols', 'film', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'play', 'writer/creator', 'Patrick', 'Marber', 'are', 'also', 'excellent.This', ""n't"", 'remotely', 'comedy', 'moments', 'levity-particularly', 'Owen-and', 'sad', 'case', 'complexity', 'cosmopolitan', 'culture', 'attitude', 'absence', 'obescense', 'perspective', 'other', 'whimsy', 'vengeance-traits', 'usually', 'result', 'damage', 'especially', 'relationships.Such', 'expose', 'introspection', 'analysis', 'standout', 'will', 'hold', 'up', 'time', 'too', 'simple', 'direct', 'subjects', 'how', 'why', 'what', 'when', 'people', 'struggle', 'other', 'intimate', 'relationships', 'subject', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'tired']",N/A

I like all of the actors and I think they are all talented. But the story is rediculous. It's a glamorization of people being irresponsible with other people's feelings, or simply downright hurtful. I'm not saying a movie can't be good if it is about this type of subject matter but it was poorly put together.Near the end when we see Alice paying for her hotel room and taking Dan back to NYC with her, he simply asks one question, and all of the sudden she doesn't love him anymore. From that moment I was totally turned off. Alice's character is not believable, she's incredibly sharp witted for a 24 y/o woman yet she's basically homeless? Nothing was realistic.

884320,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0007OCG4W,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[5, 5]","Upon first viewing of this film, I wasn't a huge believer.  I thought that Clive Owen deserved every accolade that was handed to him.  His performance was breathtaking and so full of life that his character was the one to watch for when each scene began.  He epitomized the level of good guy and bad guy all into one.  So, I was happy with his performance.  I was excited to see him playing well with others, but was this a great film?  At first, as I said before, I didn't think so, but then I thought about it.  This is one of those films that requires you to take a breath and think about the effects long after the final credits have finished rolling.  It takes your current relationship and places it right before your eyes.  This film will speak to anyone that has been in a relationship or is currently in one.  After watching it, you will think about your relationship and the horror will settle in.  This film will speak to you, it did me, and it really put into perspective the world of dating and relationships in this modern culture.  Nichols has crafted a masterpiece, and while it may not be appreciated as much now, it will remain in our society for a very long time.I have spoken briefly about the acting, but I would like to say that without a decent crew, this film could not have been as emotional as it was.  Julia Roberts turns in a performance that is very unlike her and will disappoint those who are die-hard fans, Natalie Portman proves that she is more than just Star Wars material, and Clive Owen ... Oh, Mr. Owen ... there could be nobody greater.  He controls this film and really takes his career into a new level.  I am not ashamed to say this, but I am a huge Clive Owen fan.  He does not disappoint in this film.  Then there is the snivelly Jude Law.  I must say, his performance in this film was the least impressive.  He somehow finds himself falling into very similar roles in each film that he picks up.  If you have seen Alfie, then you have seen a bit of him in Closer and vise versa.  He just isn't as great as he was when he first burst onto the cinematic scene.  Perhaps it is because he is wearing thin and cannot create fresh characters ... I dunno ... but whatever it is, he did not provide anything worth-wile to this film.So, with the acting strongly in place (sans Law), Nichols tips off the iceberg with some unprecedented cinematography that allows strong storytelling to take place.  One of the biggest elements to this film that captured my attention was Nichols ability to allow time to pass with the greatest of ease.  I thought at first that this film was going to happen within the course of a couple of days, but he builds a sense of a strong relationship by allowing it to pass over the course of several years.  You really get this feeling that these characters are together for a certain period of time and that development is occurring.  I never felt as if something suddenly happened, over the course of four years these acts of the heart take a form of their own through the watchful eye of Nichols.  It impressed me.  Also, Nichols' use of bold white coloring not only expressed the light of relationships, but also brought out the brilliance of each scene.  You became focused on certain elements, the purity of the heart, and so forth.  It was cinematic history in the making.Finally, I would like to say that this film was nothing of what I expected.  Natalie Portman's final scenes were riveting and really brought the rest of this film together.  Scenes in this film happened for a reason instead of just a chance to impress the audiences.  It was a delight to finally see a movie that came directly from the heart as well as shot to your heart.  It will invoke fear and make you appreciate the relationship that you have.  I have never experienced a film quite like this before and cannot wait to see what the brilliant mind of Mr. Mike Nichols will bring next to comment about our society and culture.  He does have his hand on the pulse of our lives, and Closer proves it.Overall, I was extremely impressed with this film.  I have always been impressed with the work of Mike Nichols' work ever since I first experienced The Graduate and this film was no different.  He has this amazing ability of building tension and love together in the same bundle.  I remember feeling similar emotions during Closer as I did while watching The Graduate.  It is this ability to pull at your heartstrings while still maintaining that sense of realism.  I could connect to some portion of this film, and I loved it.  I strongly recommend this film, but do not take your gut reaction as the first response.  Think about this film, think about yourselves, and then make your decision.  It is what I did and somehow this film still remains in my mind weeks after viewing it.  I am impressed.Grade: **** out of *****",4,the blower's daughter,1114732800,"04 29, 2005",2005,4868,"['first', 'viewing', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'believer', 'thought', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'deserved', 'accolade', 'was', 'handed', 'performance', 'was', 'breathtaking', 'so', 'full', 'life', 'character', 'was', 'one', 'watch', 'when', 'scene', 'began', 'epitomized', 'level', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'one', 'So', 'was', 'happy', 'performance', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'playing', 'well', 'others', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'first', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'then', 'thought', 'one', 'films', 'take', 'breath', 'think', 'effects', 'long', 'final', 'credits', 'have', 'finished', 'rolling', 'current', 'relationship', 'places', 'right', 'eyes', 'film', 'will', 'speak', 'anyone', 'been', 'relationship', 'currently', 'one', 'watching', 'will', 'think', 'relationship', 'horror', 'will', 'settle', 'film', 'will', 'speak', 'did', 'really', 'put', 'perspective', 'world', 'dating', 'relationships', 'modern', 'culture', 'Nichols', 'crafted', 'masterpiece', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'appreciated', 'much', 'now', 'will', 'remain', 'society', 'very', 'long', 'time.I', 'have', 'spoken', 'briefly', 'acting', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'decent', 'crew', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'emotional', 'was', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'performance', 'very', 'will', 'disappoint', 'who', 'are', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'more', 'just', 'Star', 'Wars', 'material', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Oh', 'Mr.', 'Owen', 'could', 'be', 'nobody', 'greater', 'film', 'really', 'career', 'new', 'level', 'am', 'not', 'ashamed', 'say', 'am', 'huge', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'fan', 'not', 'disappoint', 'film', 'Then', 'snivelly', 'Jude', 'Law', 'must', 'say', 'performance', 'film', 'was', 'least', 'impressive', 'somehow', 'falling', 'very', 'similar', 'roles', 'film', 'up', 'have', 'seen', 'Alfie', 'then', 'have', 'seen', 'bit', 'Closer', 'vise', 'versa', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'was', 'when', 'first', 'burst', 'cinematic', 'scene', 'Perhaps', 'wearing', 'thin', 'can', 'not', 'create', 'fresh', 'characters', 'dunno', 'did', 'not', 'provide', 'anything', 'worth-wile', 'film.So', 'acting', 'strongly', 'place', 'sans', 'Law', 'Nichols', 'iceberg', 'unprecedented', 'cinematography', 'strong', 'storytelling', 'take', 'place', 'One', 'biggest', 'elements', 'film', 'captured', 'attention', 'was', 'Nichols', 'ability', 'allow', 'time', 'pass', 'greatest', 'ease', 'thought', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'course', 'couple', 'days', 'sense', 'strong', 'relationship', 'allowing', 'pass', 'course', 'several', 'years', 'really', 'get', 'feeling', 'characters', 'are', 'together', 'certain', 'period', 'time', 'development', 'occurring', 'never', 'felt', 'something', 'suddenly', 'happened', 'course', 'four', 'years', 'acts', 'heart', 'take', 'form', 'own', 'watchful', 'eye', 'Nichols', 'impressed', 'Also', 'Nichols', 'use', 'bold', 'white', 'coloring', 'not', 'only', 'expressed', 'light', 'relationships', 'also', 'brought', 'out', 'brilliance', 'scene', 'became', 'focused', 'certain', 'elements', 'purity', 'heart', 'so', 'forth', 'was', 'cinematic', 'history', 'making.Finally', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'film', 'was', 'nothing', 'what', 'expected', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'final', 'scenes', 'were', 'riveting', 'really', 'brought', 'rest', 'film', 'together', 'Scenes', 'film', 'happened', 'reason', 'instead', 'just', 'chance', 'impress', 'audiences', 'was', 'delight', 'finally', 'see', 'movie', 'came', 'directly', 'heart', 'as', 'well', 'shot', 'heart', 'will', 'invoke', 'fear', 'make', 'appreciate', 'relationship', 'have', 'have', 'never', 'experienced', 'film', 'quite', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'Mr.', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'will', 'bring', 'next', 'comment', 'society', 'culture', 'have', 'hand', 'pulse', 'lives', 'Closer', 'it.Overall', 'was', 'extremely', 'impressed', 'film', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'impressed', 'work', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'work', 'ever', 'first', 'experienced', 'Graduate', 'film', 'was', 'different', 'amazing', 'ability', 'building', 'tension', 'love', 'together', 'same', 'bundle', 'remember', 'feeling', 'similar', 'emotions', 'Closer', 'did', 'watching', 'Graduate', 'ability', 'pull', 'heartstrings', 'still', 'maintaining', 'sense', 'realism', 'could', 'connect', 'portion', 'film', 'loved', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'gut', 'reaction', 'first', 'response', 'Think', 'film', 'think', 'yourselves', 'then', 'make', 'decision', 'what', 'did', 'somehow', 'film', 'still', 'mind', 'weeks', 'viewing', 'am', 'impressed.Grade', '****', '*****']",N/A
884321,A33AFRVRA02BAK,B0007OCG4W,alexliamw,"[6, 7]","Adapted by Patrick Marber from his own play, generally recognised to beboth one of the greatest plays of recent years and one of the most (linguistically) explicit plays ever written, Closer is a superbly dark relationship-based drama. The film version is understatedly but beautifully and sensitively shot with little fanfare and close fidelityto the original text. Like the play, other four characters have anylines, and a superb cast has been assembled to portray them on-screen,with Jude Law, Clive Owen, Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts allturning in astounding, interesting and mould-breaking performances.Every detail of the film is intelligent, subtle and keenly observed andthe story is drawn brilliantly. The backdrop is London, and on thisbackdrop occurs an intense world of pain and betrayal. As an expositionof the negative consequences of strong and intense love, Closer isperfection.There is an elegance to the mood of the film - even the violentt arguments have a beauty to them that is artistic and poetic. There isalso frequent black humour. The film is never infected byover-dramatising or straying a million miles from reality. Instead, itrings true on love, sex and the essence of humanity. The exploration ofthe power dynamics of relationships is superb: usually only 2characters converse at once, and one usually has power over the other.To see Larry (Owen) begging on his knees in a state of psychologicaldesperation in the extraordinarily sinister scene in the strip club,where Portman's acting is also phenomenal, deep and somewhatterrifying, and then the next moment totally wrapping Dan (Law) aroundhis finger and twisting him into breakdown in a form of psychologicalwarfare is profoundly affecting. Ultimately, Closer is a triumphbecause of not only its incredibly potent script but the simplyincredible acting performances. Only Roberts is less than utterlyenthralling, and even she pushes the correct buttons with her character- it simply isn't as deep or unusual compared to typical filmcharacters as the other parts are.This film is simply exquisite, and the execution is faultless. 2005 may only be a couple of weeks old, but we already have a bid for film ofthe year.

Other reviewers have outlined the plot in reviews here. My reaction was that this movie is also about timeless and innate human nature clashing with modern rules and situations of 'love'. The movie makes it clear, however, that sexual hang-ups, pride, and selfishness are just as persuasive over relationships and marriages as the 'love' is. What always amazes me is that Western movies and literature still approach relationships and sociology from a comparatively prehistoric mentality. I have yet to see a movie or read a book produced by Western civilization which integrates what we have learned from advanced Eastern societies. So despite the modern outlooks of the characters, it's only 'modern' in the context of Western ""morality"" and limited understanding of what is really important in relationships. The West continues to perpetrate 'love' in the most backward ways, and continues to christen and consummate marriages in the most prudish manners. In Asia an affair or sexual tryst would merit only the minor significance it rightly deserved. While we elevate normal sexual needs here in the West to Olympian heights, this film does portray those conflicts with a very taut and skillful cinematic flair which keeps you pleasantly tense and interested.

She then dumps him for a stalker whose followed her around for a year.  Then she dumps the stalker and gets back with Mr. Cybersex after he grovels for her.  What man ever won a woman by grovelling?  What woman ever did anything but hold a man in contempt after he grovelled?  I may not be the world's foremost expert on women, but I do know that women are just plain not attracted to men they don't respect.  And what person respects a grovelling beggar?  Begging and grovelling KILLS attraction.  This character's behavior is so contrary to reality it just kills suspension of belief stone dead.Clive Owen's character grovels and begs for this woman after he learns that she was seeing someone else when he married her, and is now throwing him over for this man.  In other words, the evident fact that she never really loved him, and has been deceiving him over an extended period doesn't seem to upset him all that much.Jude Law's character Grovels in turn for both Julia Roberts' and Natalie Portmans' character, though more realistically he ultimately loses them both.And Natalie Portman can apparently forgive Jude Law for cheating on her, lying to her, and dumping her for another woman, crawling back only after he's lost the other woman.  That's not too much for her.  But apparently she can't forgive him for asking her if she had sex with Clive Owen's character.Excuse me?Do real people act like this?  Not in the world I've lived in all my life they don't.  So how is it good drama to portray people so unbelievably?  I'm sorry, I just can't see what critics find so enchanting about films like this.  The only thing this movie has going for it are first rate actors, and that's not enough to save it.",1,Another arsty fartsy film based on unbelievable characters.,1114214400,"04 23, 2005",2005,2305,"[""'ve"", 'noticed', 'lot', 'dramas', 'everyone', 'over', 'being', 'such', 'great', 'answer', 'soulless', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'movies', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'dull', 'pretentious', 'artsy', 'fartsy', 'nonsense', 'thing', 'movie', 'be', 'example', 'fact', 'characters', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'behave', 'remotely', 'believable', 'fashion', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'character', 'up', 'first', 'man', 'who', 'went', 'aquarium', 'meet', 'having', 'cybersex', 'someone', 'thought', 'was', 'night', 'what', 'kind', 'women', 'are', 'attracted', 'desperate', 'perverts', 'then', 'dumps', 'stalker', 'followed', 'around', 'year', 'Then', 'stalker', 'back', 'Mr.', 'Cybersex', 'What', 'man', 'ever', 'won', 'woman', 'grovelling', 'What', 'woman', 'ever', 'did', 'anything', 'hold', 'man', 'contempt', 'grovelled', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'world', 'foremost', 'expert', 'women', 'do', 'know', 'women', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'not', 'attracted', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'respect', 'what', 'person', 'grovelling', 'beggar', 'Begging', 'grovelling', 'KILLS', 'attraction', 'character', 'behavior', 'so', 'contrary', 'reality', 'just', 'suspension', 'belief', 'stone', 'dead.Clive', 'Owen', 'character', 'grovels', 'begs', 'woman', 'was', 'seeing', 'someone', 'else', 'when', 'married', 'now', 'throwing', 'man', 'other', 'words', 'evident', 'fact', 'never', 'really', 'loved', 'been', 'deceiving', 'extended', 'period', ""n't"", 'seem', 'upset', 'much.Jude', 'Law', 'character', 'Grovels', 'turn', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Natalie', 'Portmans', 'character', 'more', 'realistically', 'ultimately', 'both.And', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'can', 'apparently', 'forgive', 'Jude', 'Law', 'cheating', 'lying', 'dumping', 'woman', 'crawling', 'back', 'only', 'lost', 'other', 'woman', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'apparently', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'asking', 'had', 'sex', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'character.Excuse', 'Do', 'real', 'people', 'act', 'Not', 'world', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'So', 'how', 'good', 'drama', 'portray', 'people', 'so', 'unbelievably', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'critics', 'find', 'so', 'enchanting', 'films', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'going', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'actors', 'not', 'enough', 'save']",N/A

884327,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0007OCG4W,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 6]","While some films really get stronger and stronger with each viewing, I can't say that that is the case with `Closer'.  When I first saw the film I was totally ravaged by it and swore it a near-perfect masterpiece.  It just really spoke to me, with its blunt and harsh depictions of the realities of relationships.  The performances just wowed me in every sense of the word because I felt that bitterness and that anger and that passion.Then I saw it again...and again.As time goes by and this film turns over again and again in my head I begin to see flaws I didn't notice on the outset.  Especially when you compare this with the similarly themed yet drastically different `We Don't Live Here Anymore' (which was released the same year), `Closer' begins to feel stagnant.I'll get to that in a minute.The films premise is rather simple.  Dan is a flirtatious and charming man dating Alice, a stripper who is trying to feel a part of herself that has been missing for a long time.  Dan is attempting to become a novelist.  He meets and instantly falls for Anna, a photographer, but she isn't interested in a relationship that isn't exclusive.  So, in an attempt to seek revenge, Dan ends up sending Larry (a dermatologist) after Anna, only to have his plan backfire when the two end up hitting it off.Oh the twisted web we weave.`Closer' is never tame, and it never holds back from completely wiping our faces in the dirt that has become of their relationships (""he tastes like you, only sweeter"" is still my favorite line from any movie in the past decade), but I think that in all its brave audacity one finds its biggest flaw.  `Closer' feels rather one-note.  There is no real variation of emotional complexity.  This is just a very evil film.  The performances, while seemingly powerful on the outset, lack any real longevity for me because they simply don't carry with them the range of emotion needed to make that long lasting impression.  All four actors put in some amazing work, but it's the characters that don't feel complete and so their performances don't have that well-rounded quality to them.  They are all very good at being angry and destructive.But, there is always Natalie Portman.  Say what you will about her lack of talent (the girl really has put in some `stinky' work during her career) but between this and `Cold Mountain', she proved that she has a lot of potential.  Maybe it was being given the only character that seemingly comes full-circle, but when all is said and done, it is Alice that I remember most of all.  While Clive Owen and Julia Roberts (Roberts is also remarkable astute in her performance and really elevates her characters lack of a real arc) may have the most volatile and explosive and memorable scenes in the film, it is Alice as a character (and thus Portman as an actress) that we will remember most, because her presence is so haunting.I still get shivers whenever I hear `Blowers Daughter'.In the end I still feel that `Closer' is a very good film, it just lacks that extra layer in order to achieve brilliance.  It comes on very strong, and so you initial reaction can be very deceiving (this is brash, this is brave, this is crushing; it must be marvelous!), but over time its lack of real emotional depth leaves it feeling rather shallow.  I highly recommend `We Don't Live Here Anymore' over this film, but as you can see, a B grade (which is what I am giving this film) is still very worth your time.",4,Time has only driven me further away from this film...,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,3459,"['films', 'really', 'get', 'stronger', 'stronger', 'viewing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'case', 'Closer', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'totally', 'ravaged', 'swore', 'near-perfect', 'masterpiece', 'just', 'really', 'spoke', 'blunt', 'harsh', 'depictions', 'realities', 'relationships', 'performances', 'just', 'wowed', 'sense', 'word', 'felt', 'bitterness', 'anger', 'passion.Then', 'saw', 'again', 'again.As', 'time', 'film', 'over', 'again', 'again', 'head', 'begin', 'see', 'flaws', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'outset', 'Especially', 'when', 'compare', 'similarly', 'themed', 'yet', 'drastically', 'different', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'Closer', 'feel', 'stagnant.I', ""'ll"", 'get', 'minute.The', 'films', 'premise', 'rather', 'simple', 'Dan', 'flirtatious', 'charming', 'man', 'dating', 'Alice', 'stripper', 'who', 'trying', 'feel', 'part', 'herself', 'been', 'missing', 'long', 'time', 'Dan', 'attempting', 'become', 'novelist', 'instantly', 'Anna', 'photographer', ""n't"", 'interested', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'exclusive', 'So', 'attempt', 'seek', 'revenge', 'Dan', 'up', 'sending', 'Larry', 'dermatologist', 'Anna', 'only', 'have', 'plan', 'backfire', 'when', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'hitting', 'twisted', 'web', 'weave.', 'Closer', 'never', 'tame', 'never', 'back', 'completely', 'wiping', 'dirt', 'become', 'relationships', 'only', 'sweeter', 'still', 'favorite', 'line', 'movie', 'past', 'decade', 'think', 'brave', 'audacity', 'one', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'Closer', 'feels', 'rather', 'one-note', 'real', 'variation', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'just', 'very', 'evil', 'film', 'performances', 'seemingly', 'powerful', 'outset', 'lack', 'real', 'longevity', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'carry', 'range', 'emotion', 'needed', 'make', 'long', 'lasting', 'impression', 'four', 'actors', 'put', 'amazing', 'work', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'complete', 'so', 'performances', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'well-rounded', 'quality', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'being', 'angry', 'destructive.But', 'always', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'lack', 'talent', 'girl', 'really', 'put', 'stinky', 'work', 'career', 'Cold', 'Mountain', 'proved', 'lot', 'potential', 'Maybe', 'was', 'being', 'given', 'only', 'character', 'seemingly', 'full-circle', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'Alice', 'remember', 'most', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Roberts', 'also', 'remarkable', 'astute', 'performance', 'really', 'characters', 'lack', 'real', 'arc', 'may', 'have', 'most', 'volatile', 'explosive', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'film', 'Alice', 'character', 'thus', 'Portman', 'actress', 'will', 'remember', 'most', 'presence', 'so', 'haunting.I', 'still', 'get', 'shivers', 'whenever', 'hear', 'Blowers', ""Daughter'.In"", 'end', 'still', 'feel', 'Closer', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'just', 'extra', 'layer', 'order', 'achieve', 'brilliance', 'very', 'strong', 'so', 'initial', 'reaction', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'deceiving', 'brash', 'brave', 'crushing', 'must', 'be', 'marvelous', 'time', 'lack', 'real', 'emotional', 'depth', 'feeling', 'rather', 'shallow', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'B', 'grade', 'what', 'am', 'giving', 'film', 'still', 'very', 'time']",N/A

884331,A1X1N1RHFIOCRF,B0007OCG4W,arthistoryguy,"[7, 11]","Descript words take the place of boorish visuals in veteran filmmaker Mike Nichols' modern, star-driven masterpiece ""Closer.""If we'd seen Jude Law and Julia Roberts, or Clive Owen and Natalie Portman (or any variation thereof) carry out any of the acts verbally described on screen, the film would have promptly found itself in tipple-X territory.  Instead, Nichols opts for a far more abrasive, far more vivid, portrayal of the harmful effects of too much sex with the wrong (and right?) people through the use of dialogue rather than visuals.  In this respect, ""Closer"" excels on screen where books have outrivaled films for decades.  Using dialogue rather than action exalts ""Closer"" from an over-powering, abrasive sex-farce, into a vivid representation of malice and sexuality as cohesive, and sometimes inseparable, human traits.With ""Closer"" we flicker back to how the cavemen may have reacted so many millions of years ago to unpleasant situations.  Here, the most basic human conditions are placed under a microscope.  Rather than spears and fur loin cloths, our leading characters sport Gucci suits and divorce papers; they're the same basic, jealous beasts of the old world, with a modern stealthy wisdom of vocabulary and spite that allow for a sentence to hit harder than any deadly boulder or bat.""Closer"" explores jealousy and the best weapon and indulgence that humans embrace: sex.  Each of the four major players (it's difficult to put one before the other in importance, as they seem to share equal parts of the screen and plot) carry out brilliant performances (wrongfully snubbed by the Oscars), from Jude Laws' quirky but highly sexual depiction of Dan, Julia Roberts' effortless portrayal of (seemingly) levelheaded photographer Anna, Natalie Portman's role as young and eager Alice, or Clive Owen's remarkable depiction of the scathing doctor Larry.  Each character is alive and pulsing on screen.  This is a case of four potentially great (and already super-famous) actors giving their best delivery at the same time, thanks to the wisdom of Mike Nichols and the hyper-real dialogue and story of screenwriter Patrick Marber (who not only wrote the play that the film is based upon, but also penned the script).The cinematography is kept tight on the characters' faces, but distant and isolated when it needs to be.  The movie reacts in very much the same way a stage play might: with long shots, lengthy scenes in the same settings, soliloquies and homilies filling the screen time and again with words and more words.  But Nichols does a flawless job rendering the film as a piece of cinema, while incorporating everything refined from the pages of a novel and the stage of the theater.A detail is not left unexamined.  Our characters destroy themselves and one another before our very eyes thanks to the realistic motives of desire and jealousy... the very vindictive grains of life that make humans hard to live with... or without.Grade: A+",5,A Closer Walk with Sex,1119052800,"06 18, 2005",2005,2968,"['Descript', 'words', 'take', 'place', 'boorish', 'visuals', 'veteran', 'filmmaker', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'modern', 'star-driven', 'masterpiece', 'Closer', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'variation', 'thereof', 'carry', 'out', 'acts', 'verbally', 'described', 'screen', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'promptly', 'found', 'tipple-X', 'territory', 'Instead', 'Nichols', 'far', 'more', 'abrasive', 'far', 'more', 'vivid', 'portrayal', 'harmful', 'effects', 'too', 'much', 'sex', 'wrong', 'right', 'people', 'use', 'dialogue', 'rather', 'visuals', 'respect', 'Closer', 'excels', 'screen', 'where', 'books', 'have', 'outrivaled', 'films', 'decades', 'Using', 'dialogue', 'rather', 'action', 'exalts', 'Closer', 'over-powering', 'abrasive', 'sex-farce', 'vivid', 'representation', 'malice', 'sexuality', 'cohesive', 'sometimes', 'inseparable', 'human', 'traits.With', 'Closer', 'flicker', 'back', 'how', 'cavemen', 'may', 'have', 'reacted', 'so', 'many', 'millions', 'years', 'ago', 'unpleasant', 'situations', 'Here', 'most', 'basic', 'human', 'conditions', 'are', 'placed', 'microscope', 'Rather', 'spears', 'fur', 'loin', 'cloths', 'leading', 'characters', 'sport', 'Gucci', 'suits', 'divorce', 'papers', ""'re"", 'same', 'basic', 'jealous', 'beasts', 'old', 'world', 'modern', 'stealthy', 'wisdom', 'vocabulary', 'spite', 'allow', 'sentence', 'hit', 'harder', 'deadly', 'boulder', 'bat', 'Closer', 'jealousy', 'best', 'weapon', 'indulgence', 'embrace', 'sex', 'four', 'major', 'players', 'difficult', 'put', 'one', 'other', 'importance', 'seem', 'share', 'equal', 'parts', 'screen', 'plot', 'carry', 'out', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'wrongfully', 'snubbed', 'Oscars', 'Jude', 'Laws', 'quirky', 'highly', 'sexual', 'depiction', 'Dan', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'effortless', 'portrayal', 'seemingly', 'levelheaded', 'photographer', 'Anna', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'role', 'young', 'eager', 'Alice', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'remarkable', 'depiction', 'scathing', 'doctor', 'Larry', 'character', 'alive', 'pulsing', 'screen', 'case', 'four', 'potentially', 'great', 'already', 'super-famous', 'actors', 'giving', 'best', 'delivery', 'same', 'time', 'thanks', 'wisdom', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'hyper-real', 'dialogue', 'story', 'screenwriter', 'Patrick', 'Marber', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'wrote', 'play', 'film', 'based', 'also', 'penned', 'script', '.The', 'cinematography', 'kept', 'tight', 'characters', 'distant', 'isolated', 'when', 'be', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'stage', 'play', 'might', 'long', 'shots', 'lengthy', 'scenes', 'same', 'settings', 'soliloquies', 'homilies', 'filling', 'screen', 'time', 'again', 'words', 'more', 'words', 'Nichols', 'flawless', 'job', 'rendering', 'film', 'piece', 'cinema', 'incorporating', 'everything', 'refined', 'pages', 'novel', 'stage', 'theater.A', 'detail', 'not', 'left', 'unexamined', 'characters', 'destroy', 'one', 'very', 'eyes', 'thanks', 'realistic', 'motives', 'desire', 'jealousy', 'very', 'vindictive', 'grains', 'life', 'make', 'humans', 'hard', 'live', 'without.Grade', 'A+']",N/A

884333,AORW1FRF4D4KS,B0007OCG4W,azindn,"[1, 2]","Mike Nichols' ""Closer"" is a stage play that never looses the feeling of short stories strung together and edited in a somewhat displaced chronology of bits between stripper Alice (Natalie Portman), writer Dan (Jude Law), photographer Anna (Julia Roberts), and dermatologist, Larry (Clive Owen). That no one is less that stunning and beautiful in this film is a credit to the casting of four actors who have chops behind their chiseled jaws and perfect profiles.Natalie Portman gives an eyeful of her adult nether regions for the screen in the easily most watchable section of the film. She has long outgrown the little girl of The Professional and her maturity as an actor is exceptional for those expecting a Star Wars ingenue. Equally outstanding is Clive Owen who played both the roles of Dan on stage and Larry for the film. His dark handsomeness and intensity over the disintegrating relationship with his wife (Julia Roberts) is both territorial and frantic. One can easily relate to his anguish and anger at his wife's straying.Although given top billing, Julia Roberts plays the least likable character as a passive- aggressive photographer whose brief fling with Jude Law reflects the press attention to the actor's recent notorious behaviour. Law seem totally comfortable with the portrayal of cad, a role that has all too many associations with his real life drama that eeks its way into the performance.Dialogues on fidelity, infidelity, love, and sex are the majority of conversations between characters that begins to sound preachy. Often cruel in its harshness, the relationships of these ""adults"" is vicious sparing between men too crude for Sex In The City, and too harsh for reality TV. As a slow moving storyline jumps between temporal frames, it barely moves the action forward in uneven pacing. Although the majority testosterone waving happens between revengeful Larry and Dan, a callous pretty boy who writes obituaries, the only scene between the two women early in the film is easily the choice confrontation of a wronged woman meeting the guilt- ridden slut.Sometimes the truth is too much information in relationships and neither Larry or Dan have learned that fact to the detriment of their women swapping relationships. Dissatisfaction, unhappiness, and inability to trust seems to unravel these shallow relationships as well as bore the audience to tears. While some may label this film art, it is not exactly ""art"" as ""mature,"" and its adult storyline falls short of interest as none of the characters are worthy of audience attention for the entire duration of the film. If long and boring but attractive is substance, Nichols' ""Closer"" fills the bill.",3,Too Close to Care,1141862400,"03 9, 2006",2006,2684,"['Mike', 'Nichols', 'Closer', 'stage', 'play', 'never', 'feeling', 'short', 'stories', 'strung', 'together', 'edited', 'somewhat', 'displaced', 'chronology', 'bits', 'stripper', 'Alice', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'writer', 'Dan', 'Jude', 'Law', 'photographer', 'Anna', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'dermatologist', 'Larry', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'one', 'less', 'stunning', 'beautiful', 'film', 'credit', 'casting', 'four', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'chops', 'chiseled', 'jaws', 'perfect', 'profiles.Natalie', 'Portman', 'eyeful', 'adult', 'nether', 'regions', 'screen', 'easily', 'most', 'watchable', 'section', 'film', 'long', 'outgrown', 'little', 'girl', 'Professional', 'maturity', 'actor', 'exceptional', 'expecting', 'Star', 'Wars', 'ingenue', 'Equally', 'outstanding', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'who', 'played', 'roles', 'Dan', 'stage', 'Larry', 'film', 'dark', 'handsomeness', 'intensity', 'disintegrating', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'territorial', 'frantic', 'One', 'can', 'easily', 'relate', 'anguish', 'anger', 'wife', 'straying.Although', 'given', 'top', 'billing', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'least', 'likable', 'character', 'passive-', 'aggressive', 'photographer', 'brief', 'fling', 'Jude', 'Law', 'press', 'attention', 'actor', 'recent', 'notorious', 'behaviour', 'Law', 'seem', 'totally', 'comfortable', 'portrayal', 'cad', 'role', 'too', 'many', 'associations', 'real', 'life', 'drama', 'way', 'performance.Dialogues', 'fidelity', 'infidelity', 'love', 'sex', 'are', 'majority', 'conversations', 'characters', 'sound', 'preachy', 'Often', 'harshness', 'relationships', 'adults', 'vicious', 'sparing', 'men', 'too', 'crude', 'Sex', 'City', 'too', 'harsh', 'reality', 'TV', 'slow', 'moving', 'storyline', 'jumps', 'temporal', 'frames', 'barely', 'action', 'forward', 'uneven', 'pacing', 'majority', 'testosterone', 'waving', 'happens', 'revengeful', 'Larry', 'Dan', 'callous', 'pretty', 'boy', 'who', 'obituaries', 'only', 'scene', 'two', 'women', 'early', 'film', 'easily', 'choice', 'confrontation', 'wronged', 'woman', 'meeting', 'guilt-', 'ridden', 'truth', 'too', 'much', 'information', 'relationships', 'Larry', 'Dan', 'have', 'learned', 'fact', 'detriment', 'women', 'swapping', 'relationships', 'Dissatisfaction', 'unhappiness', 'inability', 'trust', 'unravel', 'shallow', 'relationships', 'as', 'well', 'audience', 'tears', 'may', 'label', 'film', 'art', 'not', 'exactly', 'art', 'mature', 'adult', 'storyline', 'short', 'interest', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'worthy', 'audience', 'attention', 'entire', 'duration', 'film', 'long', 'boring', 'attractive', 'substance', 'Nichols', 'Closer', 'bill']",N/A

These are valid criticisms because I find it hard to understand why anyone would sit for almost two hours watching people who are detestable and who swear like Jerry Springer guests.No, I am not from Fantasyland. I work in a profession that has more reality than the average person has to ever confront and I do not shy away from films which are steeped in realism. I am also not offended by profanity and speak my share of it.Having said that, CLOSER is a pointless exercise in filmmaking because it simply turns a camera onto four vacuous, shallow people and expects to engage the audience in their meaningless lives. This approach fails for the following:All four characters are cold, selfish, and detestable. I tried very hard to care about them, but it was impossible. They have no values, are all morally bankrupt, and believe only in using others like filthy washcloths. If this sounds like the kind of ""real"" people you like to engage with, then you will love this movie.The four main characters spend the movie lying to each other and professing ""love"" for one another, but it is not love they exhibit, but merely lust. Their lives are empty, boring and tedious. There is no purpose to anything they do, except their own gratification.The male characters keep asking their wives/mistresses for ""honesty,"" as if it's a commodity to be exchanged and bartered. This ""honesty"" usually involves a high level of profanity, which at times is so over the top one ceases to care what the characters are saying.If this level of vulgarity is as common as others would have us believe, then I truly weep for civilization. Profanity for profanity's sake is not edgy, enlightening or subversive. It is merely crass, trashy and low-class.Perhaps I'm showing my age (38) by criticizing this movie. I realized I might have enjoyed this movie when I was in my 20's, when frivolous relationships and cussing were fun and exciting. As a responsible adult, this type of behavior to me now is abhorrant and I can't stand to be around ill-mannered boors like the ones depicted in this film.I am nostalgic for Mike Nichols' earlier work, like THE GRADUATE, WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF, and CARNAL KNOWLEDGE, which were truly cutting edge. CLOSER is based on a play, which confirms for me why I don't see modern plays if they are this repellant.The only plus is the acting, which is quite excellent, even the ubiquitous Jude Law, who can be quite annoying (anyone see ALFIE?). Natalie Portman is especially good as the hollow, spurned stripper with a heart of vinegar. Julia Roberts does well as a distant, emotionally stunted photographer, and Clive Owen steals the movie as the perverted, sex crazed, profanity spewing Neanderthal.Again, this is not a review from Fantasyland. I like reality in my movies as much as those who rave about this movie (I loved THE WOODSMAN and A LOVE SONG FOR BOBBY LONG). However, none of the characters in CLOSER have anything redeemable or likeable to them and the movie becomes nothing more than a tawdry, repulsive, soporific soap opera. And that song that opens and closes the movie...who chose this dirge? The singer warbles repeatedly off-key, ""Can't take my eyes off of you.."" like he's having his appendix removed. This song almost drove me mad.See CLOSER to discover why Clive Owen and Natalie Portman were nominated for Oscars, but prepare to be assaulted by crude language and cruder characters.",1,"Great Acting, Pointless Movie",1116201600,"05 16, 2005",2005,3541,"['Yes', 'am', 'one', 'critics', 'who', 'feel', 'was', 'gratuitous', 'profanity', 'unlikeable', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'valid', 'criticisms', 'find', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'sit', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'watching', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'detestable', 'who', 'swear', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'guests.No', 'am', 'not', 'Fantasyland', 'work', 'profession', 'more', 'reality', 'average', 'person', 'ever', 'confront', 'do', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'films', 'are', 'steeped', 'realism', 'am', 'also', 'not', 'offended', 'profanity', 'speak', 'share', 'it.Having', 'said', 'CLOSER', 'pointless', 'exercise', 'filmmaking', 'simply', 'camera', 'four', 'vacuous', 'shallow', 'people', 'engage', 'audience', 'meaningless', 'approach', 'following', 'four', 'characters', 'are', 'cold', 'selfish', 'detestable', 'tried', 'very', 'hard', 'care', 'was', 'impossible', 'have', 'values', 'are', 'morally', 'bankrupt', 'believe', 'only', 'using', 'others', 'filthy', 'washcloths', 'kind', 'real', 'people', 'like', 'engage', 'then', 'will', 'love', 'movie.The', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'spend', 'movie', 'lying', 'other', 'professing', 'love', 'one', 'not', 'exhibit', 'merely', 'lust', 'lives', 'are', 'empty', 'boring', 'tedious', 'purpose', 'anything', 'do', 'except', 'own', 'gratification.The', 'male', 'characters', 'keep', 'asking', 'wives/mistresses', 'honesty', 'commodity', 'be', 'exchanged', 'bartered', 'honesty', 'usually', 'high', 'level', 'profanity', 'times', 'so', 'top', 'one', 'care', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'saying.If', 'level', 'vulgarity', 'as', 'common', 'others', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'then', 'truly', 'weep', 'civilization', 'Profanity', 'profanity', 'sake', 'not', 'edgy', 'enlightening', 'subversive', 'merely', 'crass', 'trashy', 'low-class.Perhaps', ""'m"", 'showing', 'age', '38', 'criticizing', 'movie', 'realized', 'might', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'when', 'was', '20', 'when', 'frivolous', 'relationships', 'cussing', 'were', 'fun', 'exciting', 'responsible', 'adult', 'type', 'behavior', 'now', 'abhorrant', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'be', 'ill-mannered', 'boors', 'ones', 'depicted', 'film.I', 'am', 'nostalgic', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'earlier', 'work', 'THE', 'GRADUATE', 'WHO', 'AFRAID', 'OF', 'VIRGINIA', 'WOOLF', 'CARNAL', 'KNOWLEDGE', 'were', 'truly', 'cutting', 'edge', 'CLOSER', 'based', 'play', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'modern', 'plays', 'are', 'repellant.The', 'only', 'acting', 'quite', 'excellent', 'even', 'ubiquitous', 'Jude', 'Law', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'annoying', 'anyone', 'see', 'ALFIE', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'especially', 'good', 'hollow', 'spurned', 'stripper', 'heart', 'vinegar', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'well', 'distant', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'photographer', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'movie', 'perverted', 'sex', 'crazed', 'profanity', 'spewing', 'Neanderthal.Again', 'not', 'review', 'Fantasyland', 'like', 'reality', 'movies', 'as', 'much', 'who', 'rave', 'movie', 'loved', 'THE', 'WOODSMAN', 'A', 'LOVE', 'SONG', 'FOR', 'BOBBY', 'LONG', 'However', 'none', 'characters', 'CLOSER', 'have', 'anything', 'redeemable', 'likeable', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more', 'tawdry', 'repulsive', 'soporific', 'soap', 'opera', 'song', 'movie', 'who', 'chose', 'dirge', 'singer', 'repeatedly', 'off-key', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'you..', 'having', 'appendix', 'removed', 'song', 'almost', 'drove', 'mad.See', 'CLOSER', 'discover', 'why', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'were', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'prepare', 'be', 'assaulted', 'crude', 'language', 'cruder', 'characters']",N/A

Anyone who's seen a play that's been adapted to film will know that there's not a heckuva lot of action (this one being Patrick Marber's excellent Broadway play). But you can get some excellent dialogue and great character studies.Meet four screwed-up but beautiful people: Alice (Natalie Portman), an American stripper just arrived in London who gets bumped by a car; Dan (Jude Law), an obituary columnist for a local newspaper; Anna (Julia Roberts), a professional photographer who's recently divorced; and Larry (Clive Owen), a dermatologist with serious sexual issues.When Dan sees Alice hit by the car, he rushes to her aid and helps her to the hospital, where she's treated and released. But a strange relationship develops as the two banter back and forth with some snappy dialogue and incisive glances. Dan also knows Anna, the photographer, and is ""in love"" with her and tries to get her into a relationship. But when she refuses (initially) Dan and Alice move in together. But he's not through with Anna. Dan pretends to be her during an on-line chat session with Larry, the dermatologist, and asks to meet him at the London Aquarium, where Dan knows Anna visits and shoots film often. Thus, Larry makes an a$$ of himself when he first meets Anna, but they soon are entwined in a relationship, too.About a year later, because of Dan's persistence, Anna relents and forms a relationship with him, even though she's now married to Larry. And Larry is a bit taken with Alice (the stripper), too. Sound convoluted? It is, but it's also terribly insightful into the lives of human beings.______________________________________________________________________________________________As I stated at the beginning of this review, the movie-watcher needs to be prepared for a film like this before sitting down with it. It's not fast-paced or action driven. It's ALL ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. The awful and wonderful things we do to each other isn't candy-coated, and the language is brusque and often pornographic.There are also some nice little secrets about the characters that seep into the film and add a titillating surprise for those who watch CLOSER than most (for instance, check out ""Alice's"" passport toward the end of the film as she re-enters the United States).Be warned, though, this film isn't for everyone. Children and preteens should NOT watch it. Those who don't care for the vulgarities of sex-talk should also avoid it.

This could very well happen and that's what turns your stomach.By far, Clive Owen owns this movie! You are disgusted by him from beginning to end, but find yourself rooting for him on several occasions, then mad at yourself that you are doing so. But then when you look at the alternative for Anna (Julia Roberts) in Dan (Jude Law), you allow yourself the moral misstep. Dan is quietly selfish and insecure. You realize early on there's an invisible bar that he's set that no one can meet or sustain.At the end of this movie, you'll ask yourself (in regards to family, friends, and intimate relationships) are you the one setting the unrealistic bar, or are you the one trying to meet one? Are you being yourself while also allowing others to be who they are.""Alice"" was played BRILLIANTLY by Natalie Portman. She had the right balance of tough chick and little-girl-lost. You clearly understood she was someone who wanted to be loved and accepted ""as is"" flawed and all. Doesn't everyone?  She was the only innocent one, so to speak, in the entire quadrangle. She gave her body at the end masking her rejection and hurt.  We all know someone whose done this or continues to do this.  Although clearly misguided, Alice is the only one who didn't maliciously or selfishly hurt someone she claimed to love.What makes Larry so remarkable is that he understood they were all flawed INCLUDING HIMSELF,  but unlike Dan, accepted it. He knew Anna was a depressive. She didn't have to stay ""up"" and perfect for him.  Larry allowed her to have her blue funks because he knew exactly what made her function comfortably. He was quite content in lifting and supporting her in her art of ""photographing sad people beautifully"" as Alice said, hitting the Anna nail right on the head. Anna was beautiful to the world, but was sad upon closer inspection. Dan never even realized her condition because it was all about him. Larry understood 'you are what you are,' anything better than that was a great moment.  Because he understood this, he knew how to manipulate and orchestrate them all into ultimately getting what he wanted.  Dan never got ""it"" in regard to his relationships because again, it was about him and distracting from his own securities. He had lived and supposedly loved Anna, but didn't really know her - same for ""Alice."" Any revelations as to who they really were, came from outside sources.Alice told Larry hidden truths about herself because he was totally open with her - nothing hidden which in turn made her comfortable enough to talk.Julia gave a great understated performance. She wasn't overly emotional, she didn't rely on her sexuality, she simply existed from moment-to-moment as a depressive does.I challenge anyone who hated the ugliness of this movie to rewatch it with new eyes.GREAT-GREAT film!",5,Great character study!

884345,A1N37L78ZREG8Y,B0007OCG4W,Carolyn Paetow,"[2, 6]","Toward the movie's beginning, Clive Owen tells Julia Roberts that people were once fish and apes.  To judge by the plot, the film's creators must think humans are yet to make the evolutionary leap.  The couples pair off with less ritual than peacocks and rut with less consideration than cats.  Infidelity surrepticiously surges for months, and yet one-time lapses are somehow sniffed out with canine acuity.  And still these attractive, worldly individuals abide all the baseness of this crazy quadrangle as though they were players trapped in a four-actor soap opera! When, toward the movie's ending, Jude Law tells Natalie Portman that without truth people are animals, many viewers must wonder if the opposite is, in fact, reality.  For, these characters, with their cutting comments and unmindful admissions, would surely seem more human and humane by clamming up or at least utilizing the little white lie.  But then, it must be admitted, Owen's superb performance would have been muted--and this is the one standout of the film.  Often cited as having the movie's meanest or most unfeeling role, he can logically be surmised to have the most caring.  His emoting is the feature's most credible, whether it involves lust, love, jealousy, or revenge.  (Jude Law also puts in a fine performance that appears to be generally underrated).

Granted most are not this distrustful.  But, if it was not happening around us do you think we would have talk shows and all these divorces if this movie was not close to reality.You see Alice/Jane (Portman)  walking in a crowd of people and Dan (Law) walking towards her Alice crosses the street and ends up getting hit by a car.  Dan takes her to the hospital and they fall in love.  Law must leave his girlfriend for Alice because she asks if he has a girlfriend and he says yes.  So then we flash forward and Dan is getting his picture taken by Anna (Roberts) and he is interested in her...They kiss and  this is the start of a romance between the two of them.  Alice sees that Dan has a ""look"" in his eyes when he comes to meet her downstairs of the apartment he was getting his picture taken in.  She then goes upstairs with her and listens in on the conversation that Dan and Anna have.  Anna tells him no she will not see him.  So Dan goes on websites that promote sex and uses Anna's name and tells people to meet her at the Aquarium.  Larry (Owen) shows up because of this and they end up falling in love and calling Dan ""Cupid"".  Anna has a picture of Alice at her show so they go and Dan begs Anna to be with him.  We flash again and you find that Larry and Anna are married and come to find out Larry cheats on Anna and Anna is cheating on him WITH DAN and that Dan was leaving Alice to get with Anna and she leaving Larry to be with Dan.  After Dan and Anna are together she goes back to Larry to get him to sign the divorce papers she gets him to only by sleeping with him.  Starting a new spiral now Dan is upset that Anna would cheat on him.  And Dan goes back to Larry who goes to Alice and starts another spiral.

884347,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0007OCG4W,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","Well this is a film you will either like or hate. But even if you hate it, you will appreciate the complexity of the dialogue and outstanding script as well as the razor sharp directing from Mike Nichols. You will probably appreciate the outstanding acting, especially from Natalie Portman. The film is about the complexity of relationships. Relationships and love in all its variations is extremely complex and therefore when folks don't know what they want and don't tell the truth, it is bound to become a big mess and this film shows just how messy it can get. The film shows how self deception leads to deception of others. It shows how every effort to avoid pain in relationships just leads to more vulnerability to pain. It also demonstrates that in general we are much better at talking about sexual intimacy than emotional intimacy. The character of Alice, played by Natalie Portman, was certainly my favorite and I found her to be the least emotionally damaged of all the characters. Her scene with Clive Owen in the strip bar was unforgettable. She is the least calculating and emotionally constricted of the 4 main characters. Jude Law plays Dan, a fellow who doesn't know what he wants and doesn't like what he gets and has an arrogance and distance that he seems to think will protect him from emotional hurt. Because he is so into himself, ensuring that he gets what he wants without much regard to others, he is not a likeable character and in the end I felt no sympathy for him. Julia Roberts plays Anna, a cool character if there ever was one. She is withdrawn and a bit listless. She hides behind her camera and is not enthusiastic about life. Her best scene is the wonderful scene where she meets Dr. Larry in the aquarium and he thinks she is the wild sex hungry uninhibited chick he has communicated with on-line. Here she shows humor and insight, which would have served her well in trying to manage her marriage to Larry. Clive Owen, as Dr. Larry, gets five of the best scenes in the film. The film seemed to translate well from the stage to the screen. Comparisons to ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe"" don't really hold for in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe"" alcoholism and years of intimacy and keeping each other's secrets erupts. However in Closer, the anger and aggression comes not from too much intimacy but from too little intimacy, so that only sex and anger penetrate the carefully constructed veneers of three of the 4 main characters. The scene closest in intensity to the Taylor and Burton fight fests in ""Who's Afraid"" is the scene where Larry and Anna fully confront each other due to Larry's absolute insistence on hearing the worst and saying the worst. Clive Owen's performance is excellent and I empathized with him more than the other characters. Structurally the film seems to be about Anna and Dan with Alice and Larry on the edge, but the performances of Portman and Owen are so strong that the tables are turned and Roberts and Law are given a run for their money in the acting department. The dialogue is fast and sharp, so you may wish to watch it twice, if you can bear to watch human train wrecks.",4,Tongue lashings for sophisticated tastes,1294531200,"01 9, 2011",2011,3149,"['Well', 'film', 'will', 'either', 'hate', 'even', 'hate', 'will', 'appreciate', 'complexity', 'dialogue', 'outstanding', 'script', 'as', 'well', 'razor', 'sharp', 'directing', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'will', 'probably', 'appreciate', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'especially', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'film', 'complexity', 'relationships', 'Relationships', 'love', 'variations', 'extremely', 'complex', 'therefore', 'when', 'folks', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'want', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'truth', 'bound', 'become', 'big', 'mess', 'film', 'just', 'how', 'messy', 'can', 'get', 'film', 'how', 'self', 'deception', 'deception', 'others', 'how', 'effort', 'avoid', 'pain', 'relationships', 'just', 'more', 'vulnerability', 'pain', 'also', 'general', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'talking', 'sexual', 'intimacy', 'emotional', 'intimacy', 'character', 'Alice', 'played', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'was', 'certainly', 'favorite', 'found', 'be', 'least', 'emotionally', 'damaged', 'characters', 'scene', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'strip', 'bar', 'was', 'unforgettable', 'least', 'calculating', 'emotionally', 'constricted', '4', 'main', 'characters', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Dan', 'fellow', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""n't"", 'like', 'what', 'arrogance', 'distance', 'think', 'will', 'protect', 'emotional', 'hurt', 'so', 'ensuring', 'what', 'much', 'regard', 'others', 'not', 'likeable', 'character', 'end', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Anna', 'cool', 'character', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'withdrawn', 'bit', 'listless', 'camera', 'not', 'enthusiastic', 'life', 'best', 'scene', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'where', 'Dr.', 'Larry', 'aquarium', 'wild', 'sex', 'hungry', 'uninhibited', 'chick', 'communicated', 'on-line', 'Here', 'humor', 'insight', 'would', 'have', 'served', 'well', 'trying', 'manage', 'marriage', 'Larry', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Dr.', 'Larry', 'five', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'film', 'seemed', 'translate', 'well', 'stage', 'screen', 'Comparisons', 'Who', 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Wolfe', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'hold', 'Who', 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Wolfe', 'alcoholism', 'years', 'intimacy', 'keeping', 'other', 'secrets', 'erupts', 'However', 'Closer', 'anger', 'aggression', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'intimacy', 'too', 'little', 'intimacy', 'only', 'sex', 'anger', 'penetrate', 'carefully', 'constructed', 'veneers', 'three', '4', 'main', 'characters', 'scene', 'closest', 'intensity', 'Taylor', 'Burton', 'fight', 'fests', 'Who', 'Afraid', 'scene', 'where', 'Larry', 'Anna', 'fully', 'confront', 'other', 'due', 'Larry', 'absolute', 'insistence', 'hearing', 'worst', 'saying', 'worst', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'performance', 'excellent', 'empathized', 'more', 'other', 'characters', 'Structurally', 'film', 'be', 'Anna', 'Dan', 'Alice', 'Larry', 'edge', 'performances', 'Portman', 'Owen', 'are', 'so', 'strong', 'tables', 'are', 'turned', 'Roberts', 'Law', 'are', 'given', 'run', 'money', 'acting', 'department', 'dialogue', 'fast', 'sharp', 'may', 'wish', 'watch', 'twice', 'can', 'bear', 'watch', 'human', 'train', 'wrecks']",N/A

Definitely worth seeing just for the performances (especially the amazing encounter between Julia Roberts and Clive Owen, and then later the discussion between Jude Law and Clive Owen), the AMAZING dialogue, and just because of the fact that Mike Nichols directed it.",5,Mike Nichols at his best...,1116979200,"05 25, 2005",2005,1177,"['Genre', 'Dark', 'RomanceGenre', 'Grade', 'A+Final', 'Grade', 'AThis', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'possibly', 'one', 'most', 'verbally', 'sexual', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'can', 'handle', 'little', 'sex', 'talk', 'were', 'dunno', 'eight', 'people', 'so', 'who', 'walked', 'movie', 'offensive', 'language', 'sex', 'talk', 'movie', 'many', 'barriers', 'talks', 'problems', 'relationships', 'tries', 'take', 'closer', 'look', 'raw', 'emotions', 'affairs', 'acting', 'was', 'Oscar-worthy', 'person', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'coming', 'out', 'top', 'opinion', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'was', 'amazing', 'as', 'well', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'actually', 'audience', 'something', 'new.This', 'movie', 'extremely', 'depressing', 'not', 'date', 'movie', 'want', 'walk', 'away', 'feeling', 'hopeless', 'despairing', 'look', 'humanity', 'own', 'desires', 'film', 'light', 'things', 'are', 'normally', 'left', 'bedroom', 'simply', 'remain', 'unspoken', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'performances', 'especially', 'amazing', 'encounter', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'then', 'later', 'discussion', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'AMAZING', 'dialogue', 'just', 'fact', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'directed']",N/A
884350,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B0007OCG4W,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 1]","Closer is another great film from director Mike Nichols. It is like a postcard from the edge, full of carnal knowledge, unafraid of Virginia Woolf, avoiding any Catch 22's, and the graduate cum laude of the school of hard knocks. Screenplay and the Play it was based on were both written by Patrick Marber, who also wrote the Screenplay for Notes on a Scandal.It is a tremendous showcase for the acting talent of the four main characters played by Jude Law, Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, and Natalie Portman. One is a writer, mostly of obituaries--though he does write one book based on a stripper he meets when she is struck by the cab he's riding in. He falls in love with her instantly, but not deep enough to resist falling for the photographer who later shoots his photo for the book jacket. Then, after a session of cybersex where he pretends to be a woman, he inadvertently engineers the meeting of a dermatologist with his photographer lover.Infidelity and the resulting jealousy are the themes of Closer, along with the related themes of truth and identity. For instance, Alice Ayres, the stripper portrayed by Portman, uses the name of Jane while working. The dermatologist, played by Clive Owen, knows her as Alice, and he tries to get her to call herself that, to reach that level of intimacy--though she is performing a fantasy for him.------------Larry: There's a girl out there who calls herself Venus, what's her real name?Alice: Pluto.=======================But what is Alice's real name? Don't assume you know the answer to that question. This scene was of interest to me because I noticed that throughout the director would often use music, but coming from another room, slightly muffled. How Soon is Now? by The Smiths, a veritable anthem of loneliness, is heard here, but they are in a private room, the Paradise Suite, and though the song speaks to the dermatologist's yearning to be closer, it is muted and subdued.There is another scene at the opera that is played out entirely in the corridors, bar, and foyers. You never hear the opera directly, though it is Mozart's Cosi fan tutte, with Rene Fleming, no less. Another subtle comment on the theme of Closer, for the title, Cos&igrave; fan tutte, literally means ""Thus do all [women]"" often roughly translated as ""Women are like that"". Mozart and his lyricist Da Ponte took as a theme ""fianc&eacute;e swapping"" which dates back to the 13th century, with notable earlier versions being those of Boccaccio's Decameron and Shakespeare's play Cymbeline. Elements from the myth of Procris as found in Ovid's Metamorphoses are also present. Furthermore, it incorporates elements of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. Thus, it is a fitting soundtrack for this scene in Closer where the obituary writer realizes that the photographer has just cheated on him with her now ex husband, the dermatologist. Yet, you never see the opera directly, and only hear it indirectly.As well as unheard music the director also makes use of unseen scenes. Sometimes you see two people meet, and then suddenly it is a year later. He leaves all the things that happen in a relationship between the times they fall in love and out of love out of it. He cuts to the chase, as it were. Though you might expect a film of this sort to be hard to follow, it is to the credit of the director that this is never the case. No matter how convoluted the intertwining relationships, you always know who is in or out of love, cheating, cheated on, or what have you. At least you know enough to follow the story, given the high level of ambiguity the characters have about their own real feelings.Patrick Marber, the writer, really makes the most of his material. Really fantastic dialogue, or is it the brilliant acting that makes this shine? Both, actually. There is a scene where Jude Law is flirting with Julia Roberts. It is like a championship tennis match. Law serves his best lines and Roberts slams them right back at him. Bam. Bam. Bam. Match point. When did Julia get to be such a great actress? I used to think she just fell back on her Julia Roberts smile a bit too much. All the acting is of the highest calibre, as is the writing and directing.Here is a little sample of the obituary writer describing how they use euphemisms in their line of work:---------Dan: At six, we stand round the computer and look at the next day's page, make final changes, add a few euphemisms for our own amusement.Alice: Such as?Dan: ""He was a convivial fellow"" - meaning he was an alcoholic. ""He valued his privacy"" - gay. ""He enjoyed his privacy"" - raging queen.Alice: What would my euphemism be?Dan: She was... disarming.Alice: That's not a euphemism.Dan: Yes, it is.==============DIRECTED BY MIKE NICHOLSCharlie Wilson's War (2007)  (with Julia Roberts as Joanne Herring)Postcards from the Edge (1990)Carnal Knowledge(1971)Catch-22 (1970)The Graduate(1967)Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

Mike Nichols has a brilliant history of bringing complex plays to dazzling life on the screen (notably ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" and ""Angels in America""), but here, I beleive, he falters. Some plays just do not translate well to film, and ""Closer"" unfortunately, is one of them.I wanted so much to like this film. We need films that deal in a serious and penetrating way with the complexities of relationships and loving another human being. ""Closer"" aspires to this goal, but fails to reach it. I did not believe one scene in this film, and I found the many of the exchnges between the characters heavy-handed and all too theatrical. The whole film felt like artifice, like it was playing tricks with the audience comparable to the way the characters deceived each other on screen. And that is a shame, because it's ultimate themes- that we really cannot know another human being fully, and that there are limits to truth and love in a relationship- are potent and thought provoking.This is truly a situation where fascinating parts do not form a cohesive whole.

But don't confuse honesty with truth.  It's as if the writer designed a love story where the characters were chronically unfaithful but they didn't lie about it.  What if they were terrific infidels but honest about it?  Closer is one possible result.Meet Larry (Clive Owen), the sexaholic dermatologist; Anna (Julia Roberts), the American photographer living in London; Alice (Natalie Portman) the stripper from New York on an adventure; and Dan (Jude Law), a ""failed novelist"" by his own admission.  See Larry, Anna, Alice, and Dan have lots of hot, guilt-based, retributive sex in various couplings in London.  In particular, see Anna, poor Anna, have both Dan and Larry in a post-modern dual for her love and sexual favors.  Thing is, it seems that sex with these women is simply a weapon Larry and Dan use to torment, punish, and rip on one another.  Shall we go to the beginning of the story to find the roots of this libidinous grudge match?  Beats me.  Dan and Larry are constantly competing in the bedroom.It's dirty and blunt.  Never have I seen a movie where there's so much infidelity going on and so much blatant honesty about it.  Larry asked, ""did you f* him?  Where?  When?  Did you enjoy it?  Is he better than me?""  Larry and Dan are constantly trying to get the sordid details from Anna and Alice about their affairs with Larry and Dan.  Would people who love one another carry on this way, Especially if they were going to fess up about it?These characters are not simple and their motives are not always clear (if ever).  The characters have an adult quality to them, perhaps because they all recognize their need for love and attachment and through all their infidelities, they return for a connection that seems more desperately emotional than sexual.  Jude Law is perfect casting in his role as is Owen in his; Law has the physical and emotional vulnerability for his puny character, just as Owen has the brooding swarthiness to complement Larry's darkness.Closer is excellent trash about 4 confused adults hankering for love and connection and using sex to get that love.  It's like excellent chocolate:  excellent, but junk food nevertheless.  These people don't flinch at their defects; in fact, they seem to embrace them and they hold their own personal insanities very close indeed.  What are the chances of 4 people connecting with one another long enough to play these games for several years with the net result being the same as when the whole thing started?I highly recommend Closer.

He looks like he could snap walnuts between his toes.A perfect double-feature with last year's equally depressing, equally attractive, equally hard-to-stop-watching ""We Don't Live Here Anymore.""

Closer is one of those films that halfway through you just ask ""why am I watching this anyway?""Dan and Alice catch each other's eyes walking on the street in London. But Alice's unknowing of England's traffic direction gets her hit by a taxi. And so a relationship blooms. Months later(or years it's never mentioned), he decides to write a book about Alice's escapades(she's a former stripper). While being photographed for the book jacket, he lusts after the photographer Anna but she rejects him. In a weird way to take revenge he impersonates her in an online sex room(probably the funniest but awkwardest scenes I've seen) and wants to meet. Imagine the shock that the real Anna actually shows up and they get married.And basically the film is a big series of turnabouts. When the characters are with the one they love, they long for the one they really love. And so basically each man has sex with each woman and it's basically like a big orgy with none of the other characters participating.

He comes across as a kind of cold-hearted man but just really direct and forward and emotional but in a more menacing way. She plays her character as someone who justs wants things to work out but things just get in the way. In the Professional(or Leon in some cases) she played a young almost Lolita type while here it's almost full blown but there's still this aura of innocence with Natalie that makes her character a bit tragic.Jude Law almost looks like he's sleepwalking through the film and Julia Roberts looks quite miscast.

What is it that separates humans from animals - is it our capacity for forgiveness, or for adhering to the truth?  To what extent should a person lie to protect the happiness of others?  What is the nature of love in modern-day urban society?  What is happiness, and can we even recognize a happy person?  When is one being taken advantage of, and when is one properly protecting one's self?It is quite obvious that Closer was originally a play.  There is little action, only a few sets, and a huge amount of dialogue.  Fortunately, the four lead actors are all up to the challenge.  Julia Robert's thoughtful and engaging performance will surprise some people, but I felt that Clive Owen turned in the most outstanding performance, in the complex role of the manipulative Larry.  The scene in which Larry reveals to Dan the results of his scheming, reducing Dan to a whimpering shred of a human being, is a masterpiece of power and control, and Clive Owen carries it off brilliantly, with perfect timing, delivery and body language.My primary complaint about Closer is that the storyline is overly complex.  By the time the final breakup scene rolls around, after so many other breakups and reconciliations, it seems a bit too much.  The very end of the film, when Dan visits the park, does provide an answer for the final breakup, but still, I had tired of the back-and-forth by the end of the film.  Closer also does a better job at raising questions that answering them.  Viewers looking for principles or even for consistency of behavior among the main characters will be sorely disappointed, as hypocrisy and contradictions abound, but this apparent fact of modern-day life may indeed be one of the messages the film is communicating.

First, there was the critically-lauded Angels in America mini-series that aired on HBO and now the equally successful Closer. Together, they prove that there is an audience for smart dramas by and for adults. Nichols has a keen sense for absorbing character studies that explore, in unflinching honesty, the complex relationships between men and women. Closer shows the destructive results of infidelity.The characters in Closer are messed up and damaged people. They make choices that hurt others and don't think of the consequences. The dialogue is intelligent and insightful about the way people can so easily hurt each other emotionally and make the wrong choices. Mike Nichols brings a strong visual eye to the film as he successfully gives the play that it is based on a cinematic look while retaining the dialogue that has its own unique rhythm and cadence. This is due in large part to having the play's author, Patrick Marber, adapt his own work for the big screen.

Enter Anna (Roberts), a photographer who takes pictures of Dan for his novel...as you may have guessed (as did I) the time has passed years maybe and Dan and Alice are now an item and Dan has published his book.  Well, heres the problem.  Dan falls for Anna but she won't have him, you know, she won't bring herself to wreck what he has going on with Alice, but Dan is insistant.  In an attempt to exact his revenge on Anna, Dan goes to a sex-chat room and finds Larry (Owen), a sex hungrey Doctor with a few fetishes up his sleeve.  Well, Dad is under the ID of Anna and he describes himself to Larry and asks to meet him.  How Dan knew where Anna would be is beyond me, but by chance he was right and Larry meets Anna, and Larry likes Anna, and surprisingly Anna likes Larry and soon the two are engaged.  Now it's time for the fun to begin.  See now we have the affair that stirs up between Dan and Anna, the illicit afair that should have never happened.

The sad thing is that there are probably some people out there who act just like them.  This is a truly uncomfortable film to watch; it's crude, lewd, and dripping with misery from start to finish.  And the director, not satisfied at merely making you ashamed to be a human being, throws in a bonus in the form of something I found completely inexplicable at the very end.I don't know why Jude Law keeps playing pitiful losers, but he's certainly quite good at it.  The character of Dan comes right from the very bottom of the barrel.  He's a would-be novelist who seemingly falls crazy in love with Alice (Natalie Portman) after his very presence makes her walk out in front of a moving car.  Ah, this is Fate doing its thing, you think - until he puts the moves on Anna (Julia Roberts), a photographer he has just met.  Anna rebuffs his advances - sort of, and Dan gets back at her by playing a moronic (not to mention filthy) joke, which, strangely enough, brings a perverted dermatologist named Larry (Clive Owen) into her life.  Dan still lusts after Anna, even after she's married Owen, and eventually Anna and Dan fall in mutual lust and break up both couples.  This is not to say that Alice and Owen are innocent, as they engage in all kinds of perversions of their own.  To its credit, the movie doesn't exactly let everyone live happily ever after - which is good because none of these characters deserves one moment of happiness.The film is somewhat strange in that major shifts in the relationships take place off-screen; we're going along one path, and then all of a sudden we're told that we've actually been going the other direction for months and months.  The interrelationships of these four people shift more often than the plates around the San Andreas Fault - with most of the action taking place beneath the surface.  The results are emotional earthquakes that leave everything dirty and unsettled, with no solid ground upon which to build anew.  The emotional wreckage of these people's lives is not a pretty sight by any stretch of the imagination.  The acting in the film is top-notch, but the story makes Closer quite a miserable, disturbing thing to watch.",3,The perverted lives (and lies) of four miserable human beings,1123977600,"08 14, 2005",2005,2538,"['back', 'Closer', 'DVD', 'jacket', 'quote', 'Time', 'saying', 'last', 'love', 'story', 'adults', 'Obviously', 'Time', 'watched', 'wrong', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'love', 'four', 'characters', 'are', 'most', 'amoral', 'dysfunctional', 'human', 'beings', 'use', 'term', 'lightly', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'encountered', 'sad', 'thing', 'are', 'probably', 'people', 'who', 'act', 'just', 'truly', 'uncomfortable', 'film', 'watch', 'crude', 'lewd', 'dripping', 'misery', 'start', 'finish', 'director', 'not', 'satisfied', 'merely', 'making', 'ashamed', 'be', 'human', 'being', 'bonus', 'form', 'something', 'found', 'completely', 'inexplicable', 'very', 'end.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Jude', 'Law', 'playing', 'pitiful', 'losers', 'certainly', 'quite', 'good', 'character', 'Dan', 'right', 'very', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'would-be', 'novelist', 'who', 'seemingly', 'crazy', 'love', 'Alice', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'very', 'presence', 'walk', 'out', 'front', 'moving', 'car', 'Ah', 'Fate', 'doing', 'thing', 'think', 'moves', 'Anna', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'photographer', 'just', 'met', 'Anna', 'advances', 'sort', 'Dan', 'back', 'playing', 'moronic', 'not', 'mention', 'filthy', 'joke', 'strangely', 'enough', 'perverted', 'dermatologist', 'named', 'Larry', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'life', 'Dan', 'still', 'Anna', 'even', 'married', 'Owen', 'eventually', 'Anna', 'Dan', 'fall', 'mutual', 'lust', 'break', 'up', 'couples', 'not', 'say', 'Alice', 'Owen', 'are', 'innocent', 'engage', 'kinds', 'perversions', 'own', 'credit', 'movie', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'let', 'everyone', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'good', 'none', 'characters', 'deserves', 'one', 'moment', 'happiness.The', 'film', 'somewhat', 'strange', 'major', 'shifts', 'relationships', 'take', 'place', 'off-screen', ""'re"", 'going', 'one', 'path', 'then', 'sudden', ""'re"", 'told', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'been', 'going', 'other', 'direction', 'months', 'months', 'interrelationships', 'four', 'people', 'shift', 'more', 'often', 'plates', 'San', 'Andreas', 'Fault', 'most', 'action', 'taking', 'place', 'surface', 'results', 'are', 'emotional', 'earthquakes', 'leave', 'everything', 'dirty', 'unsettled', 'solid', 'ground', 'build', 'anew', 'emotional', 'wreckage', 'people', 'lives', 'not', 'pretty', 'sight', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'acting', 'film', 'top-notch', 'story', 'Closer', 'quite', 'miserable', 'disturbing', 'thing', 'watch']",N/A

As provocative and engrossing as ""Carnal Knowledge"" was it was probably one of the more unsettling viewing experiences I ever had.  I felt as if I was eavesdropping on the worst type of behavior people who are allegedly in love could do to one another.  The central characters in ""Closer"" behave badly as well yet somehow it is a more palatable viewing experience than ""Carnal Knowledge"".  You cannot conveniently villify any of the principle characters in ""Closer"".  These are individuals who are caught up in complex emotions and situations that are just overwhelming.  Credit director Nichols and scriptwriter Patrick Marber, whose stage play this film was adapted from, for not providing us with easy answers.  The ensemble cast here is uniformly excellent.  Julia Roberts as Anna probably has done her best work ever here.  Jude Law as Dan gives complexity to a character that could easily be  dismissed as a cad.  Clive Owen's star continues to rise with his account of Larry, the working-class dermatologist.  Natalie Portman is effervescent as Alice, the mysterious stripper.

884376,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B0007OCG4W,Dennis Littrell,"[5, 7]","Okay, let's get something straight right away.  If you cheat on your partner, you do NOT tell.  In fact, if you are asked about who you slept with in the past, you do not tell.  Even in junior high school you learned, you do not kiss and tell.Cheating is the big lie.  This movie is about cheating and lying.  People cheat.  They get tempted.  They want excitement.  People are animals.  But it is worse than adding insult to injury if you cheat and tell.  Don't cheat.  But if you do, don't tell.This is a clever--although I wouldn't call it slick--film about how attractive people of a certain age and milieu are always hitting on and being hit upon.  It is about the shallowness of love and the urgency of sex.  It is about pretty people on the screen fulfilling fantasies.  The dialogue is hip, sharp, although sometimes too cute and superficial.It is stylish and ephemeral.  It has the facade of realism.  Note that none of the characters have children and none of them are trying to save the world.  They are sexual and emotional hedonists, and maybe they are saying something about our times, in the big cities of the Western world at the dawn of the new millennium. On the other hand, they are urban professionals, skillfully navigating their way through the urban jungle toward a life of fulfillment and meaning...  Well, maybe not.But the emotions that the characters experience are very real.  When you love someone and that someone sleeps with your rival, it is very painful.  And when you love someone and you find that that someone doesn't love you, it is very painful.  But the psychological pain that is visited upon us at such times is also ephemeral and will pass.If you live on a farm in the middle of Nebraska, Jude Law is not going to kiss you and tempt you into cheating on your husband even if you are as pretty as Julia Roberts.  If you really are a plain Jane without style or looks, Clive Owen is going to pass you by as you sit in the aquarium.  He'll study the fish.  So this is really about Hollywood itself (although set in London) and the usual musical beds.  This is TV's ""Friends"" in the raw.  This is Mike Nichols updating Carnal Knowledge, his very sixties-ish quadrangle film released in 1971 starring Jack Nicholson, Art Garfunkel, Ann-Margret and Candice Bergen.  As in Carnal Knowledge--and, by the way, in Milan Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being (made into a film starring Juliette Binoche)--there are four attractive, sexually active people who can't keep their hands off of one another.  If you liked triangles, you randy geometricians, you'll really love quads, seems to be the thinking here.Well, I did kind of like this film.  What's not to like about Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Jude Law and Clive Owen?  They are attractive and they are talented.  The script from Patrick Marber adapting his play of the same name (with some very real influence from Milan Kundera's novel: note that in both cases there is a doctor and one of the women is in the sexual professions and the other is either a photographer or a painter) is witty and, yes, sexy.  The direction by Mike Nichols (now in his seventies) is a little uneven and sometimes cryptic, especially as regards the ending and the beginning.  (Never mind.  I would like to discuss the ending, but, alas, that might spoil the film for somebody.  As for the ""Boy Meets Girl, Cute"" beginning...well, it was VERY familiar.)  But the film is crisply edited and there are no dead spots.  You will be entertained, even if you later feel that you got seduced yourself and feel like you just ate a whole box of sugary bon-bons.Irony: while Natalie Portman plays the lower-class stripper, in real life she is (or was) working toward a medical degree at Harvard.And yes, Alice always lies and Larry always tells the truth...well, almost.  Alice's character is very complex, but not entirely realized in the film.  We are too much distracted by the sexcapades and the other personalities to see her as clearly as we might.  Portman does a good job in a challenging role.  There is something almost pathological about Alice that Portman conveys with modulated swings in mood and expression.  Larry, the doc, is, as he tells us, the caveman, while Dan is the emotional pretty boy.  And Anna...well, Anna is smart and has a deeper appreciation than the other characters of who she is and what she wants.  And she does manage to get what she wants.See this for Mike Nichols whose credits include Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf (1966), The Graduate (1967), Silkwood (1983), Postcards from the Edge (1990), and a number of other very successful films.

Leach,"[6, 11]","I agree with other reviewers when they say that Clive Owen, nasty as his character is, is the only thing vaguely remarkable about this depressing, senseless film.What is this movie trying to be? It's all about raunchy talk and twisted sexual innuendos and allusions and yet there's nothing really even approaching sex between the characters. The best I can figure is that the two leading ladies are prudes at heart. If a person wants to watch porno, obviously they can, but this movie needed to put a little bit more of its money where its mouth is if we're to get a feel for the deeper reality of the characters. All I came away with was a bad taste in my mouth from watching three and a half (Portman isn't quite as repugnantly immoral) backstabbers from hell. Law and Roberts deserve something horrid to befall them; what a couple of childish, lying, selfish monsters. Why would Owen want Roberts back the third time, simply revenge? At least his character was almost believable as some obsessive macho type with a bit of a (twisted) mind. Can't quite buy him as a doctor, though.I also definitely couldn't buy Portman's sudden about face with regard to Law at the end. Nobody who truly loves somebody as much as she supposedly loves Law could instantly and utterly write them off for simply wanting to know the truth. I couldn't really buy Portman in this role in general, actually. She seems like some kind of bleeding heart, Ivy League ______ Princess type in real life and I think that her playing a vagabond/stripper, no nudity mind you, is just one of those things actors try to do to show off their ""range"". I can't see her as anything other than Natalie Portman in anything she has yet played. She was promising in ""The Professional"" but has since never even matched her work in that film from the early 90s. I can't say I really get Roberts as a heartbreaker either.

884380,A3MDBH5KHJO1FZ,B0007OCG4W,Doctor LongGhost,"[4, 9]","In the real world, nobody talks like the characters in this movie.  Here we have four fairly unlikable people, doing their level best to elevate their banal infidelities to the level of profundity. After ten minutes, the more astute viewer will ask, ""Who cares?"" The film uses an unusual time-compression gimmick, which some may view as ""arty"" or ""cutting edge,"" but it becomes clear (right around minute 40) that this IS just a gimmick, a way to pack the whole story into a workable timeframe. The piece was originally a play, and you'll know it: Despite Mike Nichols success with previous theatrical material, Closer is amazingly stage-bound, but then again, there's only so much you can do with a painfully bad script, lines that almost scream out ""PROFUNDITY"" and actors who are taking the whole thing much too seriously. Absolutely no chemistry between any of the leads, the viewer will be wondering how ANYONE (much less these silly characters) could find any single character attractive enough to torpedo their existing relationship.  Of course, the existing relationship is with yet another one of the four characters, so that may have something to do with it. From the over-the-top sex talk in the chat room to the ridiculous approximation of a strip club, we get the feeling that the playwright (and screenwriter) has no first-hand experience.  Instead, we have the feeling that the script was written by a high-school student imagining what it would be like to have deep thoughts about sex and relationships.  Much too chilly, academic and wrongheaded. Let's face facts, ""intellectualism"" simply doesn't work unless it has some connection to life the way life is lived.  This is an exercise, pure and simple, one that speaks to nobody.  Upgraded one star for a cool twist toward the end, a twist that takes up perhaps 10 seconds of screentime.

The notion of true love in today's context is lost among a sea of infidelity, deception, lust, betrayal, jealously, cynicism, objectification, technology and vindication.Despite being set in slightly surreal environments such as a photo exhibition and a strip club, the writers and actors have successfully conveyed the emotions that run through typically dysfunctional relationships. In the end, the people involved in the web are either very certain of their own feelings finally or are so overwhelmed with rage that they become vindictive. The movie also explores the line between truth and lie; the difference each makes to a relationship and the consequence one has to bear for his/her actions.Julia Roberts hasn't got much for her role to begin with, but she shows a certain delicateness, straddling between guilt and liberty with her role that makes a performance that is sufficiently pleasurable. Jude Law packs both a cold yet emotive performance as a cheating boyfriend and later a desperate man stuck nowhere in both relationships. A performance good enough to warrant for an Oscar nod (but none sadly). Natalie Portman is stunning with middling traces of girlish vulnerability and womanly salacity, a role that won her the covted Golden Globe Best Supporting Actress. and deservingly so.  The most powerful performance must come from Clive Owen who starred in the original play. He's the one who's drawn into a destructive relationship with Roberts and turns sinister when trying to win her back through a series of confrontations and psychological manoeuvers. Both Portman and Owen have done exceedingly well to have overshadowed the leads in this case. All in all, a stellar cast and choice perfomances.

884384,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B0007OCG4W,Douglas King,"[0, 1]","I read a review that referred to ""Closer"" as ""Neil Labute lite."" I don't think this comparison is fair at all. Labute's (""In The Company of Men"", ""Your Friends and Neighbors"") films are populated by sadists, sociopaths, and disconnected doormats. The characteres in ""Closer"", although far from admirable, are, for the most part, fairly ordinary and easy to relate to. Which, in my opinion, makes their behavior all the more captivating and unsettling.The film begins when obituary writer Dan (Jude Law) meets and falls for stripper Alice (Natalie Portman). What starts out as a tender romance gets complicated when Dan gets his picture taken for his novel (ironally based on Alice's life) and feels an instant attraction to photographer Anna (Julia Roberts). Although attracted, Anna resists his advances at first, and ends up involved with dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen), who Dan inadvertantly introduces Anna to. However, after a while, Anna gives into her feelings for Dan, and the result is that the four characters end up in a subtle yet dirty power struggle to preserve their relationships and pride.Filled with scathing, sharp dialogue, and intense, difficult emotional exchanges, ""Closer"" explores the mix of tenderness, attraction, jealousy, power, competition and need that make up modern romantic and sexual relationships. Mike Nichols' direction is seamless, letting his four talented (and beautiful) leads flesh out their characters wonderfully. Natalie Portman is particularly excellent (her strip-club powerplay scene with Clive Owen is my favorite scene in the film) avoiding all the cliches and creating a character who is both innocent and jaded, manipulative and naive.

The movie is full of beginnings and endings, but with her eyes she tells us the entire middle of her character. She is cold, confused, depressed - a lost woman. A woman who wants children. A woman who wants love, but doesn't even know love herself and doesn't realize it when she has it (this goes true for all the characters). Roberts Anna is the most difficult role to play and she nails it.Clive Owen is a scene stealer, with the showiest role.

884386,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B0007OCG4W,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[9, 11]","""Closer"" is the story of four people, two men and two women, who are some of the saddest you'll ever see. It's based on a stage play, and it's obvious because this movie works like a play, giving conversation after conversation rotating between these characters. It always grabs your attention, and it always gives you something to think about. I recently wrote about ""The Machinist,"" which is a character study of Trevor Reznick. ""Closer"" has four great characters to study, and they all deserve each other. It is about the ability of being happy, telling the truth, and to love, because I don't think any of these characters are able to do any of those. Jude Law is in this movie, to add to the other five that he's in, but his preformance is not the highlight. There are four great preformances, equally from Jude, Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen, who probably was the most nasty out of all of them. You will be shocked by some of the phrases and words you hear in the film, but it's exactly the things that we say in real life. It's just more personal because you don't realize it when you say it. The movies don't normally give you such a breath of reality, but this does. It's directed by Mike Nicols, and I've only seen one of his movies, ""The Birdcage."" This is a totally different kind of movie, but it does mix elements of dram and humor, even though it's not as slapstick as ""The Birdcage.""The movie begins with Dan and Alice walking towards each other, flirting with their eyes, when she's isn't paying attention and gets hit by a car. Dan volenteers to take her to the hospital and tend  for her bloody knee and side of her face, and they get to conversation. They walk to his office, and then we cut to years later. Dan wrote a book about Alice, and is getting his picture taken for the book jacket. The photographer is Anna, and soon the two begin to kiss, when Dan tells her that Alice is going to pick him up, while still kissing her. He tells her that he's in love with her, and has to see her again, but she tells him that he will forget about her. He decides to have fun, and goes to an adult internet chat room, where he poses as a women as he talks to Larry. While Dan is just having fun, Larry is actually taking care of his sexual desires, and when Dan says ""I want to meet you,"" he tells him to meet ""her"" at the aquarium. Dan isn't really going to go, he's just busting Larry's chops. Larry meets Anna at the aquarium, thinking that she was the one on the internet, and eventually the two start their relationship. Pretty soon, Dan's affair with Anna leads Alice to become a stripper, where her and Larry meet and have their fun, as Dan, Alice, Larry, and Anna all form a web of deciet, hurt, and overall, what they believe to be love.Towards the end of ""Closer,"" Dan makes a comment saying that with the truth we'd all be animals. The irony here is that none of the characters ever tell the truth to the ones they say they love. It begins to make you wonder if any of them have the power to love, because everytime they get closer to commitment, they ""fall in love"" with somebody else. These people can all be happy if they wanted to be, but they don't. They just want to be happy during the moment they are in, and nothing more. It's very powerful, and very sad. There is some dark humor, a joke here or there, and everything works in the movie. It's getting to be that I go see a movie and expect Jude Law to be there. I've seen five of his six movies, and I think there has to be an Oscar nomination in one of them for him. I'm aiming towards this, but he was also the main focus in ""Alfie,"" which was an ""ok"" movie with a breathtaking preformance. Julia Roberts is getting better and better, and I thought she was ""getting better"" with ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" but she wasd great in ""Closer."" Her preformance in this is very different from ""Ocean's Twelve,"" but she was just having a good time while making that. Clive Owen had to be the highlight here, because he was the most nasty in the film. You spend the movie trying to figure out which characters you like and which you don't, when you  realize that you can't like any of them, because all they do is lie and cheat. ""Closer"" is a stark picture of reality, and while it takes a while for it to sink in that we are like these people, in the end, it's something that you think about for a long time.

884388,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0007OCG4W,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 4]","It is unlikely I have seen a more misogynistic film since Neil LaBute's ""In the Company of Men"", but director Mike Nichols uses his uncanny ability to delve deep into the human condition to come up with a challenging, superbly acted and at times surprisingly empathetic film about four self-absorbed, unsympathetic people. I'm not sure what other director could have been better qualified to translate Patrick Marber's stinging, cynical play set in an urban chic London. As he has proven from his 1966 debut, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" through 1971's ""Carnal Knowledge"" to ""Angels in America"" last year, Nichols knows how to humanize the brutality and emotional pain that people can inflict on each other. This master's skill is what prevents ""Closer"" from shriveling up into a wearing exercise in manipulation and deceit.Writing the screenplay from his own play, Marber provides dialogue that is alternately sharp, observant and harshly erotic. At times, his acerbic work reminds me of Frederic Raphael's superb 1960's screenplays for ""Darling"" and ""Two for the Road"". The story that brings the four characters into a sexual intersection of tete-a-tetes and one-upmanship does get rather convoluted. The film covers about four years in elapsed time but takes liberties with scene transitions, focusing on the beginnings and endings of relationships and consequently complicating the chronology and timing of events, sometimes unnecessarily. Suffice it to say that each character figures out his or her capacity for hurting someone else and then goes about feeling empowered, guilty or some combination of both. It is telling that there are hints and often threats of physical abuse in the dialogue, but nothing is executed until a final, defining slap, filmed in slow motion, of course.The acting is uniformly strong, though I believe the ""beautiful people"" aspect of the casting does distance the actors from the audience, perhaps intentionally. I am not a huge fan of Julia Roberts, but she surprises as Anna, the photographer who becomes the focal point of a shark-infested triangle. Looking rather sallow and absurdly thin, Roberts doesn't come across as all that attractive here, but her sullen demeanor seems to free her from the contrivances Hollywood has offered her for the past fifteen years.  It seems inevitable that she is now playing the older woman archetype now, and she accepts her fate with a seasoned truthfulness that propels the rest of the characters. That she gives the weakest performance among this quartet is a tribute to the high caliber of the talent involved. At first, the overexposed Jude Law plays Dan, the ethically challenged writer who fails as a novelist, as a hopeless romantic, but what he gradually uncovers is a tormented soul weakening under the burden of his deceptions. It's a brave performance especially since his character is the one most willing to hurt the others deeply for his own selfish motives.Playing Larry, the equally manipulative and sexually insecure dermatologist, Clive Owen finally sinks his teeth into a role that makes the most of his swarthy onscreen persona. His emotional nakedness and bull-in-a-china-shop approach to his problems make a brutishly affecting counterpoint to Law's rather effete character. And in what amounts to a revelation, Natalie Portman is alternately vulnerable and bruising as Alice, the stripper who falls hard for Dan and won't give Larry the intimacy he needs when he is rejected by Anna. Eschewing any trace of the child actor she was, Portman tantalizes with her flighty sexuality and then grounds her character deeply when she is subject to an excruciating break-up from Dan. Her character's evolution, however sketchily it is presented, is the only one that achieves a poignancy that nearly transcends the story's cynicism. I have to admit the unrelenting tone does induce a numbing effect that makes you wonder why you should care about the fate of any of the characters. But leave it to Nichols to make you want to know what happens to each of them. Damien Rice's ""The Blower's Daughter"" is used effectively as a musical bridge for their comings and goings.

Mike Nichols' ""Closer"" is also one of the most utterly pompous and frustrating films I have ever seen in spite of some truly powerful acting by its all-star cast.  Instead of bringing me into the lives of these four people and allowing me to emphasize with them and understand their pain, I found myself utterly repulsed and perplexed by the actions of these characters.  I kept looking for some deeper meaning or some actual point, but in the end, I was left with nothing.In this film, Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen are selfish, manipulative, needy people who prey on each other like sharks at a feeding frenzy of the emotions.  They lie and cheat... and then they go lie and cheat again.  It's a never-ending cycle of betrayal, sex, and dishonesty.  For the first half-hour or so, I felt engaged in the romantic drama of these characters.  At the end of this hour and forty minute mess, I was so incredibly sick of these people and angered by their absolutely horrendous actions.  There was no moral, no lesson, and no message.  Unless you count the idea that men and women are incapable of forging a lasting and genuine happiness as a message.  And for most of us, that is simply untrue.What sort of pompous pessimism is this?  Just because the writer, Patrick Marber, may have had bad experiences with love, he felt the need to write a whole play about it?  And then adapt it to a screenplay?

884396,A84UFSF2SZS2W,B0007OCG4W,"EriKa ""E""","[0, 0]","Closer tells the story of self-centered characters and their selfish motivations (and this is why it is interesting). Some reviews and viewers insist that this kind of story produces no sympathetic or likeable characters. I disagree.The selfish, flawed nature of each character makes each one more believable and human (which the slightly stilted dialogue-adapted from an original stage play-could easily have masked had less skillful actors played in these roles) and ultimately moves the story along. Perhaps the lack of sympathy viewers and reviewers profess is because some of the more hypocritical and brutal aspects of the characters hit too close to home. As the poet Gavin Ewart wrote in ""Short Time"": ""when two illusions meet, let there not be a third/of the gentle hypocrite reader prone to think/that he is wiser than these self-deceivers. / Such dreams are common. Readers have them too.""Indeed at the core of this film a divide exists between who the individuals really are and the perception of who they should be (ideally). After seeing the film, which didn't immediately overwhelm me, I found myself thinking about the motivations driving each character. (This is part of the strength of the film: it is thought-provoking and leaves one wondering after the fact.) Without spoiling any endings, one must wonder why Julia Roberts' character Anna makes the choice she does. One must also wonder, especially by the end, if any of these characters knew one another at all or if they were so self-involved that they used the others in their lives to fill voids absentmindedly, disregarding all the consequences. Did anyone in this story truly know the individuals s/he chose to have in her/his life?The timeline in the film jumps around, as the film's four characters jump into and out of each other's lives. The film begins with Damien Rice's song ""The Blower's Daughter"" (auspicious beginnings, if I may say so) and almost immediately two of the four characters (Jude Law's ""Dan"" and Natalie Portman's ""Alice"") meet. As the story skips ahead, Dan and Alice live together, and Dan meets and ardently pursues Julia Roberts's ""Anna"". (He is, at least initially, rebuffed.) Enter (through rather comedic circumstances) ""Larry"" (the most human and real character of the film played effectively by Clive Owen). Anna and Larry get married, and at this point, relationships start to unravel, revealing both the selfishness and the deep vulnerabilities in each character. Trust, if indeed there ever was trust between any of these characters, breaks down. It is never clear, though, that the people involved have any real clue what they want. Mostly it is the same old story: they want what they can't have but don't want it when they have it.Not being a fan of Julia Roberts or Jude Law, I was prepared to dislike their roles. However, Law was perfect as wishy-washy, hypocritical Dan, and Roberts was razor sharp in both her sarcasm and in her more emotional scenes (particularly with the talented Clive Owen, who is always eminently watchable). Natalie Portman's performance, if not her character, is probably the most arresting here because her Alice is at once strong and self-sufficient but at the same time has the appearance of someone needy and vulnerable. She announces to Dan at the beginning of the film that her relationships end because she falls out of love, and she is always the one to leave. In the end, when Dan treats Alice as a kind of consolation prize and comes back to her more out of desperation than real respect or feeling, the viewer wonders not only what Dan really knew about Alice (he perceived and assumed rather than really knowing/finding out) but also what lies below the surface with anyone in life. Just as in real life, individuals often seek out others to stroke their egos and to feel ""needed"", and this story weaves multiple variations of this kind of emotional manipulation into one story.",4,what did we really know about you?,1110326400,"03 9, 2005",2005,3934,"['Closer', 'story', 'self-centered', 'characters', 'selfish', 'motivations', 'why', 'interesting', 'reviews', 'viewers', 'insist', 'kind', 'story', 'sympathetic', 'likeable', 'characters', 'disagree.The', 'selfish', 'flawed', 'nature', 'character', 'one', 'more', 'believable', 'human', 'slightly', 'stilted', 'dialogue-adapted', 'original', 'stage', 'play-could', 'easily', 'have', 'masked', 'had', 'less', 'skillful', 'actors', 'played', 'roles', 'ultimately', 'story', 'along', 'Perhaps', 'lack', 'sympathy', 'viewers', 'reviewers', 'profess', 'more', 'hypocritical', 'brutal', 'aspects', 'characters', 'hit', 'too', 'close', 'home', 'poet', 'Gavin', 'Ewart', 'wrote', 'Short', 'Time', 'when', 'two', 'illusions', 'meet', 'let', 'not', 'be', 'third/of', 'gentle', 'hypocrite', 'reader', 'prone', 'think/that', 'wiser', 'self-deceivers', '/', 'Such', 'dreams', 'are', 'common', 'Readers', 'have', 'too', 'Indeed', 'core', 'film', 'divide', 'who', 'individuals', 'really', 'are', 'perception', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'ideally', 'seeing', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'immediately', 'overwhelm', 'found', 'thinking', 'motivations', 'driving', 'character', 'part', 'strength', 'film', 'thought-provoking', 'one', 'wondering', 'fact', 'spoiling', 'endings', 'one', 'must', 'wonder', 'why', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'character', 'Anna', 'choice', 'One', 'must', 'also', 'wonder', 'especially', 'end', 'characters', 'knew', 'one', 'were', 'so', 'self-involved', 'used', 'others', 'lives', 'fill', 'voids', 'absentmindedly', 'disregarding', 'consequences', 'Did', 'anyone', 'story', 'truly', 'know', 'individuals', 's/he', 'chose', 'have', 'her/his', 'life', 'timeline', 'film', 'jumps', 'around', 'film', 'four', 'characters', 'jump', 'other', 'lives', 'film', 'Damien', 'Rice', 'song', 'Blower', 'Daughter', 'auspicious', 'beginnings', 'may', 'say', 'so', 'almost', 'immediately', 'two', 'four', 'characters', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Dan', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Alice', 'meet', 'story', 'skips', 'ahead', 'Dan', 'Alice', 'live', 'together', 'Dan', 'meets', 'ardently', 'pursues', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Anna', 'least', 'initially', 'rebuffed', 'Enter', 'rather', 'comedic', 'circumstances', 'Larry', 'most', 'human', 'real', 'character', 'film', 'played', 'effectively', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Anna', 'Larry', 'get', 'married', 'point', 'relationships', 'start', 'unravel', 'revealing', 'selfishness', 'deep', 'vulnerabilities', 'character', 'Trust', 'indeed', 'ever', 'was', 'trust', 'characters', 'breaks', 'down', 'never', 'clear', 'though', 'people', 'involved', 'have', 'real', 'clue', 'what', 'want', 'Mostly', 'same', 'old', 'story', 'want', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'when', 'have', 'it.Not', 'being', 'fan', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Jude', 'Law', 'was', 'prepared', 'dislike', 'roles', 'However', 'Law', 'was', 'perfect', 'wishy-washy', 'hypocritical', 'Dan', 'Roberts', 'was', 'razor', 'sharp', 'sarcasm', 'more', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'talented', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'who', 'always', 'eminently', 'watchable', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'performance', 'not', 'character', 'probably', 'most', 'arresting', 'here', 'Alice', 'once', 'strong', 'self-sufficient', 'same', 'time', 'appearance', 'someone', 'needy', 'vulnerable', 'Dan', 'beginning', 'film', 'relationships', 'end', 'love', 'always', 'one', 'leave', 'end', 'when', 'Dan', 'Alice', 'kind', 'consolation', 'prize', 'back', 'more', 'desperation', 'real', 'respect', 'feeling', 'viewer', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'Dan', 'really', 'knew', 'Alice', 'perceived', 'assumed', 'rather', 'really', 'knowing/finding', 'out', 'also', 'what', 'surface', 'anyone', 'life', 'Just', 'real', 'life', 'individuals', 'often', 'seek', 'out', 'others', 'stroke', 'egos', 'feel', 'needed', 'story', 'multiple', 'variations', 'kind', 'emotional', 'manipulation', 'one', 'story']",N/A

884400,A2BPDFR58H9575,B0007OCG4W,Galina,"[5, 6]","My three favorite films from 2004, ""Sideways"", ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", and ""Before Sunset"" have a lot in common; they all deal with ability to connect with other people, with meeting one's true love and losing it, with memories that will not go away, and with possibilities of second chances.There are more similarities in three my favorite films - they all have characters I liked, I care about; often, weak and certainly not perfect; sometimes, confused and immature but sympathetic, and real.This is not the case with ""Closer"". My problem is that none of its four main characters was at least slightly interesting, appealing, likable or just realistic. And it is not the biggest problem that they were not likable - I can live with that and still love and enjoy the film. Examples - Nichols's own fascinating debut, ""Who is Afraid of Virginia Woolf"". George and Martha (Liz Taylor and Richard Burton) were a couple from hell but like a theme song in ""Closer"" goes, ""I could not take my eyes off them"". I still remember Taylor saying in the end of the film, ""George and Martha: Sad, sad, sad"" and it was sad. I'd learned something about the characters that were deep and complex, troubled and disturbed. They were persons, the human beings, not the caricatures. Another example, Ingmar Bergman's ""Scenes from the marriage"":""Bergman and his leading actors Liv Ullmann and Arland Josephson give one of the most truthful, honest, heartbreaking and credible portraits of a couple, one of the most intense character studies ever done on film. For five hours, we share twenty years from the lives of Johan and Marianne as well as their love, hate, misunderstandings, insecurities, anger, jealousy, denial, sadness, pain, despair, and loss. We witness the moments of incredible tenderness and unexpected and shocking violence, both physical and mental. There are no depth that they have not descended in the search of themselves and the meaning of their relationship.""As far as a film about the selfish, self-obsessed, unsympathetic characters goes, ""Faithless"", directed by Liv Ullmann and written by Ingmar Bergman could be the most similar in its theme to ""Closer"" and they both have almost identical twist plot toward the end. The difference is huge, though. ""Faithless"" has a high and unbearable tragedy that characters brought upon themselves, ""Closer"" is smug, full of itself and tries to hide its emptiness behind often disgusting and unnecessary dirty language. Did I learn something about four beautiful people in ""Closer""? Sure. Dan's sperm tastes like Larry's but sweeter; Alice's c*** tastes like heaven, and Anna does not kiss strange men and does not understand why sex is so important. I don't want to get closer to learn all this; instead, I'd like to respond like Helen Sinclair, ""No, no, don't speak. Don't speak. Please don't speak. Please don't speak. No. No. No. Go. Go... Don't speak.""Enormously talented and famous (and rightly so) Mike Nichols made an elegantly looking, well acted (Natalie Portman and Clive Owen are very good) and quite amusing film which is a screen adaptation of a popular play of the same title. Popular or not, the play was not a great work of writing and its problems are very obvious after adaptation to the big screen.2.5/5",2,"I don't want to get closer or why did not they ask Helen?,",1176681600,"04 16, 2007",2007,3286,"['three', 'favorite', 'films', '2004', 'Sideways', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'Sunset', 'have', 'lot', 'common', 'deal', 'ability', 'connect', 'other', 'people', 'meeting', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'losing', 'memories', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'away', 'possibilities', 'second', 'are', 'more', 'similarities', 'three', 'favorite', 'films', 'have', 'characters', 'liked', 'care', 'often', 'weak', 'certainly', 'not', 'perfect', 'sometimes', 'confused', 'immature', 'sympathetic', 'real.This', 'not', 'case', 'Closer', 'problem', 'none', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'least', 'slightly', 'interesting', 'appealing', 'likable', 'just', 'realistic', 'not', 'biggest', 'problem', 'were', 'not', 'likable', 'can', 'live', 'still', 'love', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Examples', 'Nichols', 'own', 'fascinating', 'debut', 'Who', 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'George', 'Martha', 'Liz', 'Taylor', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'were', 'couple', 'hell', 'theme', 'song', 'Closer', 'could', 'not', 'take', 'eyes', 'off', 'still', 'remember', 'Taylor', 'saying', 'end', 'film', 'George', 'Martha', 'Sad', 'sad', 'sad', 'was', 'sad', ""'d"", 'learned', 'something', 'characters', 'were', 'deep', 'complex', 'troubled', 'disturbed', 'were', 'persons', 'human', 'beings', 'not', 'caricatures', 'example', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Scenes', 'marriage', 'Bergman', 'leading', 'actors', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', 'Arland', 'Josephson', 'give', 'one', 'most', 'truthful', 'honest', 'heartbreaking', 'credible', 'portraits', 'couple', 'one', 'most', 'intense', 'character', 'studies', 'ever', 'done', 'film', 'five', 'hours', 'share', 'twenty', 'years', 'lives', 'Johan', 'Marianne', 'as', 'well', 'love', 'hate', 'misunderstandings', 'insecurities', 'anger', 'jealousy', 'denial', 'sadness', 'pain', 'despair', 'loss', 'witness', 'moments', 'incredible', 'tenderness', 'unexpected', 'shocking', 'violence', 'physical', 'mental', 'are', 'depth', 'have', 'not', 'descended', 'search', 'meaning', 'relationship', 'As', 'far', 'film', 'selfish', 'self-obsessed', 'unsympathetic', 'characters', 'Faithless', 'directed', 'Liv', 'Ullmann', 'written', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'could', 'be', 'most', 'similar', 'theme', 'Closer', 'have', 'almost', 'identical', 'twist', 'plot', 'end', 'difference', 'huge', 'though', 'Faithless', 'high', 'unbearable', 'tragedy', 'characters', 'brought', 'upon', 'Closer', 'smug', 'full', 'tries', 'hide', 'emptiness', 'often', 'disgusting', 'unnecessary', 'dirty', 'language', 'Did', 'learn', 'something', 'four', 'beautiful', 'people', 'Closer', 'Sure', 'Dan', 'sperm', 'tastes', 'Larry', 'sweeter', 'Alice', 'c***', 'tastes', 'heaven', 'Anna', 'not', 'kiss', 'strange', 'men', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'sex', 'so', 'important', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'closer', 'learn', 'instead', ""'d"", 'like', 'respond', 'Helen', 'Sinclair', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'No', 'Go', 'Go', 'Do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Enormously', 'talented', 'famous', 'rightly', 'so', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'made', 'elegantly', 'looking', 'well', 'acted', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'quite', 'amusing', 'film', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'popular', 'play', 'same', 'title', 'Popular', 'not', 'play', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'work', 'writing', 'problems', 'are', 'very', 'obvious', 'adaptation', 'big', 'screen.2.5/5']",N/A
884401,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B0007OCG4W,General Breadbasket,"[1, 3]","""Closer"" is a dramatic film, written and based on the play of the same name by Patrick Marber. I kept getting recommended it on amazon.com, so I decided to see it on DVD. I didn't know what to think of it before I saw it, and I still don't know what to think of it.Set in London, we see Dan (Jude Law), a wannabe novelist whose life soon becomes tangled up in Alice's (Natalie Portman), a waitress and former stripper. Dan falls in love with her, but also with Anna (Julia Roberts), a photographer he uses for his author cover photo. But Dan doesn't stop there, he brings Larry (Clive Owen) into things when he bumps into him in an adult chat room pretending to be Anna, who he sets up with her. Lies are told, everyone falls in love with everyone else, more lies are told, everyone cheats on everyone else and time passes. That's pretty much it.Even before I knew ""Closer"" had once been a play, I could tell that it had been meant for theatre. The dialogue has that stilted, scripted vibe, and you can tell that not much has changed in the adaption scriptwise. Still, the characters are very strong, and the way they interact with each other is probably my favorite part of the film. It's well casted, but then again, if Jude Law's in it I usually like it anyway.The character interaction, though really strong and interesting, is about the only thing I liked about this film. All the smut, the sex, the lying, the cheating, the swearing, the strip clubs and the upper middle class banter I didn't find very entertaining at all. Also, the characters are so flawed that they're almost beyond sympathy. Sure, thinking about it I can feel sorry for Alice, because she's younger than all the rest and probably didn't know any better, but the rest...Whenever I see a film or play like this, rather serious exploring man's faults to a fault, I kind of wonder what the point is. Liars and unfaithful partners exist, yes, but when they and there motives are so meticulously explored liked this, it almost, almost seems like a celebration of these faults rather than a warning or something similar. When Jude Law's character pretends to be a woman in the adult chat room, for example, its played as if it was meant to be funny.There's a scene in the film where two of the main characters, Alice and Larry, are discussing art. They begin discussing the photography exhibition, and neither of them like it very much. Every person whose picture has been taken looks sad, jaded or depressed, but has been made to look beautiful. Alice says, they are made to look beautiful through art, but they are still sad and depressing. Who are these people, she says, who would pay to go see them? In some ways, I feel the same about this film. Great, great character interaction, but that's about it, the rest is a bit depressing for me.",3,Liars and Cheaters Getting Closer,1152403200,"07 9, 2006",2006,2815,"['Closer', 'dramatic', 'film', 'written', 'based', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'Patrick', 'Marber', 'kept', 'getting', 'recommended', 'amazon.com', 'decided', 'see', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'saw', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'it.Set', 'London', 'see', 'Dan', 'Jude', 'Law', 'wannabe', 'novelist', 'life', 'soon', 'becomes', 'tangled', 'up', 'Alice', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'waitress', 'former', 'stripper', 'Dan', 'love', 'also', 'Anna', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'photographer', 'author', 'cover', 'photo', 'Dan', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'Larry', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'things', 'when', 'bumps', 'adult', 'chat', 'room', 'pretending', 'be', 'Anna', 'who', 'up', 'Lies', 'are', 'told', 'everyone', 'love', 'everyone', 'else', 'more', 'lies', 'are', 'told', 'everyone', 'cheats', 'everyone', 'else', 'time', 'passes', 'pretty', 'much', 'it.Even', 'knew', 'Closer', 'had', 'once', 'been', 'play', 'could', 'tell', 'had', 'been', 'meant', 'theatre', 'dialogue', 'stilted', 'scripted', 'vibe', 'can', 'tell', 'not', 'much', 'changed', 'adaption', 'scriptwise', 'Still', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'strong', 'way', 'interact', 'other', 'probably', 'favorite', 'part', 'film', 'well', 'casted', 'then', 'again', 'Jude', 'Law', 'usually', 'character', 'interaction', 'really', 'strong', 'interesting', 'only', 'thing', 'liked', 'film', 'smut', 'sex', 'lying', 'cheating', 'swearing', 'strip', 'clubs', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'banter', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Also', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'flawed', ""'re"", 'almost', 'sympathy', 'Sure', 'thinking', 'can', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Alice', 'younger', 'rest', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'rest', 'Whenever', 'see', 'film', 'play', 'rather', 'serious', 'exploring', 'man', 'faults', 'fault', 'kind', 'wonder', 'what', 'point', 'Liars', 'unfaithful', 'partners', 'exist', 'yes', 'when', 'motives', 'are', 'so', 'meticulously', 'explored', 'liked', 'almost', 'almost', 'celebration', 'faults', 'rather', 'warning', 'something', 'similar', 'When', 'Jude', 'Law', 'character', 'be', 'woman', 'adult', 'chat', 'room', 'example', 'played', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Alice', 'Larry', 'are', 'discussing', 'art', 'begin', 'discussing', 'photography', 'exhibition', 'very', 'much', 'Every', 'person', 'picture', 'been', 'taken', 'sad', 'jaded', 'depressed', 'been', 'made', 'look', 'beautiful', 'Alice', 'are', 'made', 'look', 'beautiful', 'art', 'are', 'still', 'sad', 'depressing', 'Who', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'pay', 'go', 'see', 'ways', 'feel', 'same', 'film', 'Great', 'great', 'character', 'interaction', 'rest', 'bit', 'depressing']",N/A
884402,A5DXP7QPGR5A0,B0007OCG4W,Gianmarco Manzione,"[2, 2]","The reviewer below who suggests that this movie has ""no poetry"" is profoundly mistaken. The Script is cold and therefore truer to experience than most, and boasts some knock-out lines that might make Seamus Heany grin. Note Larry's (Clive Owen) assertion, after being wickedly seduced by a much younger but devilishly confident Alice (Natalie Portman), that ""she has the moronic beauty of youth,"" a line that showcases the lyric intensity that managed to sneak its way off the stage and onto the screen. Of the film's many riveting one-on-one scenes, the best is probably the one in which Dan (Jude Law), a naive, romantic and childish writer, suggests that Larry does not understand love or the human heart, to which Larry, who is a surgeon, heroically rresponds ""Have you ever SEEN a human heart? It is a fist covered in blood!"" This tense dynamic between two opposite poles of character is nothing less than brilliant and makes for an entirely memorable clash of talents. Additionally, this is Natalie Portman's coming-of-age performance, as she has never seemed more in command of her boundless powers and is destined to earn more attention for this role than for all of her others combined. Because this is an adaptation of a play that focuses deeply on four specific characters and how they weave in and out of one other's private sagas, it is impossible to review the movie as a whole without reviewing each actor's performance. Portman very obviously steals the show, and while Owens is indeed slightly miscast, his talent transcends that handicap quite convincingly. Jude Law is similarly miscast in an unusually meek role for him, though his performance is no less persuasive. Above all, though, this is a profound script with many lessons to teach. If nothing else, one is forced to wonder after seeing this film whether love is merely a temporary madness, a spasm of the emotions that convulses through our nerves and dies, leaving us to recover from the disease without aid. There is something oddly comforting about this otherwise uncompromising inquiry into human attraction, how it allows us to feel less crazy about our own obsessive tendencies and those romantic blunders in the past that screw the blades of memory into our sides even years later.

From the extraordinary writing by Patrick Marber (based on his own play by the same name) to the impeccable direction by Mike Nichols tot he fine ensemble acting by Jude Law, Clive Owen, Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts, this film is a brilliant multifaceted jewel.CLOSER (as is so often the case in the English language) as a word can have two meanings: 'closer' as in moving toward, and 'Closer' as in the final word in a conversation or deed. For this reviewer I see the latter as the true meaning of the title of this intriguing story of passion, drama, love, and abandonment among two couples - no, four disparate and desperate people.  Serendipity plays a major role in the way these people meet, react with passion, respond, mate, break up, rejoin, and search for the meaning of love in a time when the blur between sex and love has polarized our understanding of relationships.Each of the four actors in this turbulent tale gives outstanding  performances and it would be difficult to assign the 'best actor' among them.  But more important than their individual achievements is the utter commitment to ensemble acting that Nichols demands and gets. The cinematography is mesmerizing and the music scoring not only introduces a fine signature song that opens and closes the film, but also the movie uses Mozart's ""Cosi van tutte"" as the ongoing background music.  Those familiar with the parallel story of the opera with the film will appreciate the subtleties even more, but the radiant singing by Renee Fleming and Anne Sophie von Otter suffuses this film with a special glow.

884406,A2H9VMR8QRLINY,B0007OCG4W,granite,"[3, 4]","I wasn't particularly impressed with this film. It's more like a mystery than a character study about the nature of love and betrayal: you'll be investigating whose words mean anything, looking for signs of true emotion.We have four youngish, unattached people in the unfortunate, but hardly tragic, situation of being in relationships, but in fact ""fancying"" other people. For some odd reason, it doesn't occur to them to just simply leave the partner they are not interested in. One guy cheats on girlfriend for a year before he decides to leave her, one of the women actually marries a guy in the middle of her affair with another guy (don't want to give away the names here, it's part of the detective work).The characters tell each other they love each other, while lying and cheating, so your detective work must go beyond the words. Another step could be to see who tells the truth to whom - perhaps that's a sign of true emotion. But one of the characters has no truth to tell (because he has no emotions I can detect) and another tells the truth to the guy she doesn't love.Other reviewers called this a character study. True, there is no plot, but for an adapted play the characters are remarkably flat. Many talk about the brutal honesty of the film (yes, there is quite a bit of coarse language having to do with sex, but it doesn't bother me and I wouldn't categorize it as honesty), but there was only one split second when I, the viewer, was actually touched by what was going on on screen: the end of Larry and Anna's conversation in their apartment.

The film begins with the four protagonists; Julia Roberts as Anna the recently divorced photographer, Jude Law as Dan the obit-writer/ wanna-be-novelist, Natalie Portman as Alice, the nice girl that is a stripper, and Clive Owen as Doctor Larry, the skin doctor in more ways than one, clearly identified. Just what possessed these people to act so very needy and clingy, both before and after, bouts of cruel, devious, and fickle emotional tirades, is beyond me. However, that is at the heart of this fine work of filmmaking and the reason to see it.BOTTOM LINE: BE FOREWARNED THIS IS A VERY SAD STORYIf the four characters were flawed, the men seemed more obviously so than the women. I'm not sure if that is the way it really was, or just the way I perceived it. Nevertheless, it seemed to me as though two essentially nice girls with issues, and in need of nurturing became absorbed by two rather self-centered cads with a penchant for treating women, like less than dirt. It was not until the end that the real flaws in the women's characters' became obvious, especially in Alice, who had played a misunderstood fallen angel for most of the film. Nevertheless, both Julia Roberts as Anna and Natalie Portman as Alice were excellent in their roles. Jude Law was a contemptible cad, albiet - well acted, but Clive Owen was nothing short of a self-proclaimed 'cave-man' with a stated double standard for himself. Maybe that means Clive Owen should be honored for his performance, but it frankly just turned me off - period, and made the film harder to believe.",4,A COMPELLING BUT PAINFUL FILM TO WATCH,1154044800,"07 28, 2006",2006,1781,"['THE', 'SUPERBIT', 'EDITION', 'SOUNDS/LOOKS', 'GREAT', 'BUT-NO', 'SPECIAL', 'FEATURESIN', 'A', 'NUTSHELL', 'IN', ""'CLOSER"", 'LOVE', 'A', 'ROUGH', 'ROAD', 'film', 'bit', 'hard', 'take', 'watch', 'same', 'time', 'viewer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'film', 'four', 'protagonists', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Anna', 'recently', 'divorced', 'photographer', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Dan', 'obit-writer/', 'wanna-be-novelist', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Alice', 'nice', 'girl', 'stripper', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Doctor', 'Larry', 'skin', 'doctor', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'clearly', 'identified', 'Just', 'what', 'possessed', 'people', 'act', 'so', 'very', 'needy', 'clingy', 'bouts', 'cruel', 'devious', 'fickle', 'emotional', 'tirades', 'However', 'heart', 'fine', 'work', 'filmmaking', 'reason', 'see', 'it.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'BE', 'FOREWARNED', 'THIS', 'VERY', 'SAD', 'STORYIf', 'four', 'characters', 'were', 'flawed', 'men', 'seemed', 'more', 'obviously', 'so', 'women', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'way', 'really', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'perceived', 'Nevertheless', 'seemed', 'two', 'essentially', 'nice', 'girls', 'issues', 'need', 'nurturing', 'became', 'absorbed', 'two', 'rather', 'self-centered', 'cads', 'penchant', 'treating', 'women', 'less', 'dirt', 'was', 'not', 'end', 'real', 'flaws', 'women', 'characters', 'became', 'obvious', 'especially', 'Alice', 'who', 'had', 'played', 'misunderstood', 'fallen', 'angel', 'most', 'film', 'Nevertheless', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Anna', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Alice', 'were', 'excellent', 'roles', 'Jude', 'Law', 'was', 'contemptible', 'cad', 'albiet', 'well', 'acted', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'self-proclaimed', ""'cave-man"", 'stated', 'double', 'standard', 'Maybe', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'should', 'be', 'honored', 'performance', 'frankly', 'just', 'turned', 'period', 'made', 'film', 'harder', 'believe']",N/A

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[4, 7]","Patrick Marber, the author of the play by the same name wrote the screenplay for Mike Nichols' screen adaption so I assume he's happy with this production. First, Mike Nichols continues to give us one fine movie after another-- from his first THE GRADUATE to his most recent ANGELS IN AMERICA. This film is no exception and is wonderfully filmed-- there are lots of closeups of the characters that we expect from Nichols and certainly appropriate here since the movie essentially is about four individuals who do an awful lot of talking-- when they aren't changing partners and bedrooms. The acting is superb: Julia Roberts as Anna, Jude Law as Dan, Nathalie Portman as Alice and Clive Owen as Larry give tremendous performances. These are beautiful people who are selfish and nasty to everyone they should care about most, i.e., their spouses and/or lovers.A friend of mine used to say that he didn't care for either fiction or movies if he couldn't like any of the characters. Using that criterion, this movie falls on its face. On the other hand, if you want to see people acting very badly and completely self-centered, then you'll find this movie to your liking.Alice says it all in a scene near the end of the movie when she finally kicks Dan out of her life, saying something to the effect that he didn't have to be cruel to her by being unfaithful and sleeping with Anna, that all of us should realize that there's a line we shouldn't cross in order to prevent hurting someone we love.

You should never forget that after that memorable and anthological film: who `s afraid of Virginia Woolf? In 1966, Mike Nichols simply reencountered with himself. He is one the most brilliant and propulsive directors of the last Century, thanks to him Jack Nicholson's career achieved a special peak.Four defined characters will meet in London. A frustrated male photographer(Julia Roberts), a dare devil writer(Jude Law) who pretends to reach the sudden notoriety through his emotive biographical memories with a girl with serious affective problems and limited self stem who aspires a major status in this society, and finally a bore dermatologist (Clive Owen)who works out as the opposite mirror like image of Law (notice how they exchange high tension dialogues while they are chatting).These are the defined pieces; and since that dramatic premise there will be an anthological game of wounded wills, emotional double crosses, emotive blackmails, oppression and reinsertion of new patterns of behavior before these serious affective lacks.Try to pay special attention respect a very brief but emblematic lines in the motel, when Natalie Portman says: ""Where is the love?"" And she concatenates four verbs in tandem: See me , feel me , touch me , hear me. Does not this sequence sound familiar to you? Well let me refresh the dramatic nucleus of Tommy: the famous Rock Opera. I guess this was a fabulous touch of genius by the screen writer, as well as the prologue and epilogue: can't take my eyes over you, another emblematic homage to that famous song of the late sixties.One of the most original pictures in that year and a marvelous tour de force, that rejoins us with those golden years where the chamber works of overwhelming theatrical stages became successful films (A streetcar named desire, A long day journey through the night) are by themselves the best evidence.""Love is the eternal toy that the women pretend to give and the men assume they receive.""

Will we stay together? Does she really love him?  Can I trust her/him?  My take on the film is that we adults in Western society seem persistently uncertain about whether we are happy or not, whether the other guy is happier, whether I might be happier with another woman: in short,  how can I have my pussy and eat it too.  Into London flys Natalie Portman, something of a free spirit, something of an innocent in so far as she loves and when loves goes she walks, or flys, to some, a rather infantile notion as ""romantic love"" may have been transformed iknto something else, something deeper. She brings a certain dynamic into the lives of three locals - a photographer, a writer and a doctor., and at the end she returns to the States.

884416,A7PZZXJJZM4N2,B0007OCG4W,Isaac,"[8, 12]","It takes a lot of nerve to share a relationship with someone and then, without warning, throw it right back in their face. Emotions flare, terrible words are spoken, and attitudes become difficult to seeth, motivating both parties to take revenge on one another in some form. Unfolding events can be disastrous, and can sometimes involve other people who may or may not have motives of their own.That is the electric energy of ""Closer,"" a film so emotionally powerful but so painfully honest that it can polarize your reactions to it. It involves four attractive people who are unattractive on the inside. They are probably unaware of this, and when they all become submerged in a messy predicament, their inner selves are graphically revealed. They are darkly sadistic, articulate in their manners, and sufficient in animosity. These four individuals are normal, everyday people just like the rest of us. They have problems just like we do, and we are forced to remain entangled with their lives. Rarely does a film inadvertently use its characters for a long-lasting impact, and rarely does a movie connect so effortlessly with the audience.Alice (Natalie Portman) and Daniel (Jude Law) lock eyes while walking towards each other on a London street. Alice, focused on putting her flirting skills to good use and still used to the fact that American traffic comes from the left, is hit by a taxi cab. When she comes to her senses a number of seconds later, having sustained a few cuts, she sees Daniel standing over her, smiles, and she says, ""Hello, stranger.""A following sequence shows the two sitting in a hospital waiting room, riding on a bus, taking a stroll through a park, and chatting about who they are. Alice is a stripper, newly arrived in London, who fled New York City to escape a bad relationship. Daniel is a struggling novelist who writes obituaries, or ""the Siberia of journalism."" Alice says that she is into meeting new people and finding a new profession. They hit if off, roughly at first, and eventually move in together.Time passes and Daniel has written a novel, and the main character of which is based on Alice. Enter Anna (Julia Roberts), an American photographer who says that she has an interest for taking pictures of strangers. Daniel introduces Anna and Alice to one another and they share a private conversation when Daniel leaves. ""I'm not a thief,"" Anna assures Alice. But Alice knows, just as well as we do, that she is lying.More time goes by. Daniel has, shall we say, an ""Internet conversation"" with Larry (Clive Owen), an opinionated dermatologist. Posing as Anna, Daniel sets up a date between Larry and Anna. Coincidently, Anna is at Daniel's proposed meeting place at the appointed time, and after moving past an embarassingly awkward meeting, Larry and Anna manage to develop a romantic connection. This is a trick that Daniel will soon regret, because Larry is a man who is so confident with his emotions that he feels inclined to judge the inequities of others.The two couples are cross-introduced. The events that follow and how they effect each individual should only be hinted at, not thoroughly discussed. But watching the film is to be burdened with a few underlying questions. Do these characters actually love their partners, or are they using one another to satisfy their carnal lusts? And the biggest question, of course, is why? Why do they do the things that they do to each other?But see, I like movies that make me think like this. I like to absorb a movie and draw ideas out its context. ""Closer"" is bold work. Hinging solely on the issue on relationship infidelity, it artistically examines the presence--or absence--of love and honesty in relationships. The film runs so deep that the love rectangle becomes trivial; the film is really about who these people are and what they are capable of.The film, set over a four year period, is a sequence of the characters meeting each other in pairs and weaving their ways in and out of each other's emotions (the exchange between Larry and Anna at their house wins my award for the most painful scene of the year). All of them are perfectly written and emotionally sincere, but my absolute favorite is the scene between Larry and Daniel towards the end of the film. The two men are polar emotional opposites: Larry is an aggressive, firey-tempered hothead and Daniel is passive and meek. This exchange is like a Tyco truck going up against a tank; there is no way that Daniel can arise victorious. But notice how quickly the two men seem to calm down. After witnessing everything that has come before, and the one scene that comes after, we realize that each man is perfectly capable of sustaining the other's personality.Roberts, Law, Portman, and Owen deliver spellbinding performances, and detailing their actions will spoil the whole movie. Let's just say that the ones who appear to be the sheep turn out to be the wolves. The film is ironic in the sense that its problem forces the characters to simultaneously bring about their worst qualities and their best. They are equipped with hidden motives, dirty secrets, and lies, and they all seem to take pleasure in what they do to one another. Its as if they are four different superpower nations aiming nuclear weapons at each other, waiting for a missile to fire so they can set off a domino effect.What the movie fails to do--and I say this in admiration--is force us to pick sides. Yes we are involved with the characters, but the film does not supply us with a particular one to cheer for. We love all four of them but we don't love all four of them. They are evil people, but since we recognize them as humans, we relate to them. This is a paradox that deprives the movie of typical methods and empowers it with intellect. It even causes the movie to walk a thin line between romance and psychological drama.The destinies of the four people I will not reveal, but ""Closer"" has a solution that is uplifting, heartbreaking, and bittersweet in three different areas of thought. In the end, we also wonder if the characters make the right decisions. This is a movie that demands much out of the audience, and it even requires us to analyze ourselves as people.After seeing the movie, I paced around the outside of the theater for about fifteen minutes, reflecting on what I had just witnessed. ""Closer"" is a thinker's movie. It implanted an impact on me that I will not soon forget. The movie doesn't just stop when the story ends; it continues to resonate long after the end credits role, and, in reference to the title, it pulls the audience closer.NOTE: I also took a few moments to study the film's poster in the theater lobby, and I noticed something about the faces of the characters. If you do what I did and concentrate hard on the positioning of their expressions and how they are presented, you will be able to tell who I think the real ""villain"" is. But then again, I might be thinking too hard. - IsaacRated R; 102 minutes; Directed by Mike Nichols",5,Closer,1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,7022,"['lot', 'nerve', 'share', 'relationship', 'someone',

884418,A19JYLHD94K94D,B0007OCG4W,Itamar Katz,"[1, 3]","Once again, Mike Nichols shows us just how clever he is. I don't agree that this is his best film in years - let's not forget Primary Colors, Birdcage, and the heavenly brilliant Angels in America (ignore Wolf and What Planet Are You From), but it certainly is a return to his roots, and definitely his most serious and straightforward film in many years, probably since Carnal Knowledge. It shares, in fact, many of the themes and qualities of Carnal Knowledge (as well as other early classics like the Graduate and Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf) - Like that film, its scale is very small in place and very large in time, following a small group of characters over long time gaps; likewise, we only catch glimpses of their lives, and get most of the information on important events from the characters themselves. Like Carnal Knowledge, Closer focuses on inter-relations between the four main characters, betrayal, mistrust and insincerity. Closer is bleaker, though. It's probably the bleakest thing Nichols had done. It's a downer that doesn't seem extremely special and original as you watch it, but it sticks with you. After all, that's an important mark of a good film.As for the acting, now: despite my patriotic support of Natalie Portman (her being originally from Israel) and my undying love for her ever since I saw her as a child in Leon, she didn't really impress me in Closer. She tries to be sexy and mysterious, but she's still just a sweet girl, and she doesn't truly convince. Julia Roberts had always gotten on my nerves, and Closer is no exception. The male actors are the ones who really outdo themselves here; Jude Law and Clive Owen are both fantastic, obnoxious and pathetic at the same time as only a real man can be. You despise them and you pity them and you understand them. You are them. These are two great young actors who have a bright future ahead of them.Interestingly enough, Mike Nichols never did write his own texts. All of his films were written by other people, and like Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf and Angels in America, Closer is also an adapted play. Yet he has a fascinating way of making the texts his own. The dialogues in Closer are well-written, no doubt; but just like in his previous films, it's his brilliant dialogue directing with which Nichols leaves his distinct mark and which makes it convincing, amusing and unnerving all at once.

Stupid Alice gets hit by a car, yet surprisingly, only gets a scraped knee. They date, then devious Dan writes a book and meets cold American Anna who is a photographer. They are smitten but he can't have her. Eventually they meet back up and get involved, but Anna has a British doctor boyfriend. Anna gets married to the vulgar doctor but cheats with devious Dan while he is still with stupid Alice. Anna and Dan leave their lover/spouse to be together. They fall out, and Anna goes back to her hubby, while Dan goes back to Alice. Did I forget to mention that Alice and the vulgar doctor(can't remember Clive Owen's name in the movie) have a fling out of revenge for their lovers cuckholding them. Anyway, Dan and Alice fall out because Dan can't accept Alice slept with the Doctor. Then cold Anna and the doctor are together again for good, or until either one of them meets somebody else who strikes their fancy; and Dan is alone while Alice goes back to America where every dude in NY is taken with her as she walks down the street.These people are simply the most pathetic, mean-spirited, disgusting folks I have ever seen on film in a good while. I know love and real life are complex and that everything isn't black and white, but these people suffer from Attention Deficit Disorder regarding romantic relationships.The word ""love"" is uttered so much, yet shown so little. How can Jude Law's Dan be so in love with Natalie Portman's Alice, then be willing to leave her after one meeting with Julia Robert's Anna? Everybody seems to find the lover they're with at the time as interchangeable with the previous one.The acting is superb, but the dialogue is atrocious, and the scenes are crude: especially the strip club scene and the scene of confrontation between husband and wife where Clive Owen shows why I find him scary. The acting attracts me even though the overall picture is so-so. There is something void in this film: heart? spirit?One more thing: Dan has absolutely no problem being with Anna while she is still sleeping with her husband, yet all of a sudden he can't be with her anymore when he finds out she slept with her husband one last time before supposedly filing the divorce papers?Second thing: in real life, we fall in love gradually and also fall out of love gradually. But in this movie, everyone falls in love immediately, and to watch Alice, falls out of love immediately too. Dan says something offensive to her and it's, ""I loved you two minutes ago, but not anymore because you just said something stupid. Bye.""If anything, this is a character study on what love ISN'T, and also the fact that those who fall in love at first sight never stop looking.",3,"If this is love, I don't want it.",1144886400,"04 13, 2006",2006,2760,"['Basic', 'story', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'British', 'guy', 'Dan', 'meets', 'American', 'girl', 'Alice', 'Stupid', 'Alice', 'hit', 'car', 'yet', 'surprisingly', 'only', 'scraped', 'knee', 'date', 'then', 'devious', 'Dan', 'book', 'meets', 'cold', 'American', 'Anna', 'who', 'photographer', 'are', 'smitten', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'Eventually', 'meet', 'back', 'up', 'get', 'involved', 'Anna', 'British', 'doctor', 'boyfriend', 'Anna', 'married', 'vulgar', 'doctor', 'cheats', 'devious', 'Dan', 'still', 'stupid', 'Alice', 'Anna', 'Dan', 'leave', 'lover/spouse', 'be', 'together', 'fall', 'out', 'Anna', 'back', 'hubby', 'Dan', 'back', 'Alice', 'Did', 'forget', 'mention', 'Alice', 'vulgar', 'doctor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'name', 'movie', 'have', 'fling', 'revenge', 'lovers', 'cuckholding', 'Anyway', 'Dan', 'Alice', 'fall', 'out', 'Dan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'Alice', 'slept', 'Doctor', 'Then', 'cold', 'Anna', 'doctor', 'are', 'together', 'again', 'good', 'one', 'meets', 'somebody', 'else', 'who', 'strikes', 'fancy', 'Dan', 'alone', 'while', 'Alice', 'back', 'America', 'where', 'dude', 'NY', 'taken', 'down', 'street.These', 'people', 'are', 'simply', 'most', 'pathetic', 'mean-spirited', 'disgusting', 'folks', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'good', 'while', 'know', 'love', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'complex', 'everything', ""n't"", 'black', 'white', 'people', 'suffer', 'Attention', 'Deficit', 'Disorder', 'regarding', 'romantic', 'relationships.The', 'word', 'love', 'uttered', 'so', 'much', 'yet', 'shown', 'so', 'little', 'How', 'can', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Dan', 'be', 'so', 'love', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Alice', 'then', 'be', 'willing', 'leave', 'one', 'meeting', 'Julia', 'Robert', 'Anna', 'Everybody', 'find', 'lover', ""'re"", 'time', 'interchangeable', 'previous', 'one.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'dialogue', 'atrocious', 'scenes', 'are', 'crude', 'especially', 'strip', 'club', 'scene', 'scene', 'confrontation', 'husband', 'wife', 'where', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'why', 'find', 'scary', 'acting', 'attracts', 'even', 'overall', 'picture', 'so-so', 'something', 'void', 'film', 'heart', 'spirit', 'One', 'more', 'thing', 'Dan', 'absolutely', 'problem', 'being', 'Anna', 'still', 'sleeping', 'husband', 'yet', 'sudden', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'anymore', 'when', 'out', 'slept', 'husband', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'supposedly', 'filing', 'divorce', 'papers', 'Second', 'thing', 'real', 'life', 'fall', 'love', 'gradually', 'also', 'fall', 'love', 'gradually', 'movie', 'everyone', 'love', 'immediately', 'watch', 'Alice', 'love', 'immediately', 'too', 'Dan', 'something', 'offensive', 'loved', 'two', 'minutes', 'ago', 'not', 'anymore', 'just', 'said', 'something', 'stupid', 'Bye', 'anything', 'character', 'study', 'what', 'love', ""N'T"", 'also', 'fact', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'never', 'stop', 'looking']",N/A

884422,A39VJRIW7HC5C0,B0007OCG4W,James Kunz,"[1, 3]","After watching this film I was in a state of ambivalence the likes of which I had not seen in a long time.  Closer featured four actors at the top of their game, wonderful dialogue, a fairly downbeat ending (I rather like downbeat endings- they're so much more powerful than light and happy ones), some very amusing scenes, and a very novel approach to a relationship movie.  However, I did not like the film's structure, feeling that by flashing forward over so many months a lot was left off the table.  While I recognize that this tactic could be seen by some as adding to the narrative instead of detracting from it, I felt it was far more of a hindrance than a help.  Nonetheless, it was not the jumpy trajectory that really got to me, it was the fact that each one of the four main characters was a truly miserable person.  Although the characters start out as relative innocents, in a few scenes all of them have become in turn vapid, power-crazed, masochistic, obsessive, foul, cheating, and low.  At the end all four are despicable and not worthy of the audience's time.  Now this could still be a compelling picture and to some degree it is, but the movie is not really about their plummet to deplorability (indeed some of the characters begin that trip in the second sequence).  Instead of judging its characters the movie merely observes their interactions, and herein lies my principle complaint.  Was Closer boring?  No, not at all.  Was it involving, well-acted and well-directed?  Yes, absolutely.  Was it an enjoyable film? No, it was not, hence my two and a half star (out of four) rating.

Perskie ""ceruleana""","[11, 15]","Four of the most physically attractive and artistically talented actors of the Big Screen come together under the direction of the brilliant Mike Nichols to perform in ""Closer,"" an adaptation of Patrick Marber's brutal play, and the result is 104 minutes of utter depression and angst. I thoroughly appreciate the performances of Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Clive Owens and Natalie Portman. Their acting skills are not in question here, and frankly, they're all a pleasure to watch. Eye-candy aside, however, I just viewed the movie and feel like someone hit me over the head with a sledgehammer - not a state I appreciate, nor one I would pay to return to. ""Closer"" is a film about four loathsome people - actually only three are detestable, one is just terribly self-destructive, which is why she hangs out with the others. Although not devoid of merit, this is a cold and wounding piece that left me raw. I am not warning you away. But please do consider my comments before you commit to watch this film. Think aftermath.Dan, (Law), and Alice, (Portman), give each other the eye as they walk toward each other on a London street. She is luscious and so is he. When she steps off the curb and is hit by a cab, Dan is by her side in a second. Lying in the street, Alice regains consciousness, looks up at him and says, ""Hello stranger."" As he accompanies her to the Emergency Room we discover that he is a journalist - a novelist wannabe - who writes obituaries by day. She is a former stripper from New York City, on a trip across the big Pond. The chemistry between the two is palpable and they hook right up.A year or so later Dan is being photographed for his newly published novel's back cover. The book is about the life of his live-in love, Alice. Anna, (Roberts), is the talented photographer, who specializes in making portraits of strangers. As she snaps away and poses Dan, he makes a play for her. They talk, flirt, kiss passionately - and then Anna discovers he is taken. She makes it clear to Dan that she is recently divorced and not about to mess up any one else's life. He is in a relationship with Alice. He is not available. Period! Alice comes to meet Dan at the studio. She senses something's up very quickly. Then Anna takes Alice's photograph, while tears run down the poor girl's face.Dan becomes obsessed with Anna and stalks her, unbeknownst to Alice. Shortly after the scene at the photography studio, we are introduced to Larry, (Owen), a dermatologist. He is fooling around in a sex chat room on the Internet, having torrid cyber sex with a person he believes to be a woman named Anna. It is really Dan. The outcome of this online tete-a-tete is a set-up for Larry to meet the real Anna at the aquarium. Dan's prank, revenge for the brush-off he received, results in a romance between Larry and Anna. Then the real fooling around begins.Four former strangers, all remotely connected, have become two couples. Each person seems to love his/her mate, yet are compelled to destroy their love, and each other's relationships. Betrayal is a characteristic three of the four share. Dan lusts after Anna, and believes himself ""in love"" with her, because Anna doesn't ""need him."" Dan also loves Alice, who loves him madly, but she is too needy. Larry is crazy about Anna. He says it is love, yet people who love each other certainly don't act as manipulative and nasty as Larry does. But then, with Anna, manipulation may the only game in town. Anna is chronically depressed and doesn't think she deserves to be happy. She wants Dan, but he is not available, so she commits to Larry. Then she becomes unhappy and decides that deception may not be so terrible after all. And Larry, who is not to be underestimated, is ruthlessly capable of anything in order to get what he wants. Three characters are narcissistic, cruel, totally obsessed with pain and wrecking emotional havoc. The fourth, Alice, simply seems to hate herself. Is there a plot here? No!! As a character study, what's there to study? There is nothing complex about these people, nor their interactions. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being sublimely happy and 1 being suicidally depressed, these four never manage a 5.Natalie Portman does a superb job, bringing an appealing freshness and vulnerability to the edgy, jaded Alice. Clive Owen's character is the most complex, and his range of emotions really gets a work-out here. He is charming as Anna's suitor, enraged as the betrayed lover, and relentless as the gamesman out for revenge. Jude Law, the cad, comes on strong until his legs are knocked out from under him. Then he is appropriately devastated. Not pretty, but talented. And Julia Roberts, whom I love, is quiet, depressed and odious in her betrayals. The dialogue is very good at times, with snappy, caustic one-liners. My rating is more about personal preference than the movie's overall worth.

I had not read all that much about it. However, I had been transported by the Damien Rice theme song.  Therefore, I was expecting a cute little romantic film, starring some hot looking stars.  Do not make the mistake I made, friends. I was unprepared by the intense animalistic rawness of the plot and the cruelty and harshness of the subject matter, which involved the things people will do to each other in the NAME of LOVE. Hey, yes, it happens. People do behave this way, at times. Trust is at a premium, for me at my age though, and this was rough to watch. Do NOT under any circumstances tackle this movie with a ""first date"" as you eat pizza in front of the tv. It is definitely not that sort of flick. You will both sit motionless and forget to chew your crust, I predict. Just don't go there.Talk about intense. Intense acting, suberbly brought out by Nichols, who is the ringmaster of the complicated circus of a plot. Super beautiful cinematography, so you can feel tasered and attempt to process what the heck is going on, in very pretty Londony environs.Recommendation: Give yourself a couple of days to think about this movie after you have seen it. I believe it was a worthwhile experience to undergo, and I am still mulling it over. Nope, it isn't Die Hard, and it isn't Daddy Day Care...but it IS something you might want to consider seeing anyway.

Munson,"[2, 4]","Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, Jude Law, and Clive Owen star in this seductive and sometimes trashy thriller about lies, deceit, and hurting the one you love.  Roberts stars as Anna, a portrait photographer who takes pictures of strangers.  Portman stars as Alice, a stripper/waitress who has just arrived in London after a failed relationship.  Law stars as Dan, an obituary writer who has dreams of becoming a successful novelist, and Owen stars as Larry, a dermatologist who is addicted to internet chat rooms.Dan meets Alice after she's hit by a taxi.  He takes her to the hospital and, after a while, a relationship forms, and Dan has begun work on his novel.  However, Dan also becomes involved with Anna (unknown to Alice).Larry is drawn in by Dan, who is posing as a woman on one of the chat rooms that Larry frequents.  Dan explains that his name is Anna and she wants to meet him.  Larry is given directions to Anna's photography gallery, where, after a brief amount of explaining, Larry and Anna form a relationship of their own and wind up getting married.Eventually, all four become intertwined with each other in a deceitful web of lies and mistrust.The characters do an excellent job of portraying the kind of relationship one hopes they never have; one based on lies and mistruths.  If you can stand the overabundance of very foul language, then you should enjoy this film.  The acting, especially by Natalie Portman, is very good, and Portman's portrayal of Alice is the highlight of the movie.

Jude Law has shown shades of this character before.

The performances by, especially Owen, Portman and Roberts were simply great and nasty, especially Owen.  Law's performance was good as well, but not on the same level with the other three.  We all knew Owen and Roberts had acting range, but Portman showed her range as a maturing and saucy actor in this film.  However, like I said, the movie was almost excellent in its portrayal of human frailty, conquest and vindictiveness and human hoping that there is a back-up if things don't work out.  However, the screenplay (based on a play) had huge gaps, not the kind of gaps that make you think ""what was his or her motive"" but just simply like it felt scenes were missing that should of been there, possibly an editing issue-Two much film was cut out.  Maybe I had a flawed DVD (sarcasm).  Nichols (director) had a great history with some great films, but his films of late have not been up-to-par with past work-But he's been out of the game for awhile.  However, as a veteran director, he should have noticed the missing pieces that would have put this movie together.  It is a shame, it could have been excellent, I just hate it when a film was there, but through, whatever reason, fell short.  The short of the movie is about a couple of manipulative men, a young woman with no future and a mature woman who could have anyone-And does-But settles for what she did for who knows what reason and a couple a partner swapping.  This is a movie about two men who try to outwit each other-A game-But one of them gets outwitted and comes up empty.  Too bad, it had so much potential.  I would highly recommend watching, but you'll come out thinking ""what just happened and why did it happen?""  The movie doesn't place clues as to motives of the characters or why things happened the way they did and that was the missing puzzle pieces.

One of the incredible things about this film is that it deals so heavily with guilty sex without actually fleshing the act out.  ""Closer"" is fueled by a lot of smart, powerful, dirty, caustic dialog; in one memorable scene, Roberts spits out something vile (or appealing, I suppose) enough to make her ""Pretty Woman"" character look like Laura Bush.  Though a thoroughly pouty, serious film, there are enough laughs and plot twists to keep the viewer from slitting their wrists.  Clive Owen's performance is brutally phenomenal, earning him his first Oscar nomination and hopefully his share of prized roles in years to come (just stay away Jerry Bruckheimer, please...PLEASE). As a complex stripper, Natalie Portman proves that she can do adult drama (and adult entertainment, for that matter), and people who find her to be ""hot"" should see this movie right away.  Jude Law, though his character is perhaps the least likeable, reminds us that he's still a world-class actor.  Hell, anyone who wants to see the best acting ensemble of the year should see this film.Not exactly a feel-good movie, and certainly not for anyone who would complain, ""there was too much talking"" in movies.

It brought to mind the desperate angst that followed the loss of silly, shallow relationships that, in retrospect, can barely be recognized as relationships.  It reminded me that it was so much about the tears, the drama, and pervasive immaturity.Despite this resonance, I did not like the movie.  The main characters are shallow, painfully self-centered and mean.  No one seemed to grow during the course of the story.  I don't think that the characters had the ability to progress beyond the limits of their self absorption.If you still want to see this movie, be advised that it probably had a hard time holding on to its ""R"" rating because of scenes in a strip club and the detailed discussions about sex that seemed to go on endlessly.  Parents should DEFINITELY view this before they allow their teenaged children to see it.It also seemed to me that Julia Roberts had a hard time being her character.  It was not a natural fit for her.  She is better when she can flash her gorgeous smile, and there was very little need for smiling in this flick.  Furthermore, it is puzzling how two megastars, Julia and Jude Law, were convinced that this was a good career choice.Overall, I would characterize this as 4 talking heads agonizing about their sexual entanglements and pseudo relationships.

884441,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0007OCG4W,Joe Sherry,"[6, 8]","A film by Mike Nichols""Closer"" is a film about beginnings and endings.  We are given a look into how relationships begin, and how they end.  Very little of what happens in between is ever seen on screen.  Because of this, there are time gaps in the story of up to a year, but after the first gap and you figure out just what the structure is, it is barely noticeable.  ""Closer"" begins (appropriately enough) with the meeting of Alice (Natalie Portman) and Dan (Jude Law).  Alice is walking down a London sidewalk.  Dan is following her, observing.  It isn't clear if he is stalking her, or just admiring her beauty.  When Alice looks the wrong way when crossing the road, she is American, she is struck by a car.  Dan is right there to get her help and this begins a flirtation and their relationship.Dan meets Alice.  Dan meets Anna.  Anna meets Larry.  Dan leaves Alice.  Anna leaves Larry.  Larry meets Alice.  To call ""Closer"" a romantic triangle would be to do the film a disservice, not to mention that there are four people involved in this ""triangle"".  The romantic pairings up and hooking up is the method these characters use to try to fulfill something that is lacking in their lives.  But the real point here is the conversation that comes about because of it.  The conversation that happens at the beginning and the ending of a relationship is the most interesting, and the most intense because the emotions are heightened and more focused, both with joy and with pain.  The dialogue is sharp, incredibly intelligent (I've never come across conversation like this before in my life), it feels realistic, flirtatious, and very sexual.  In particular, the dialogue at the endings of relationships is quite graphic.""Closer"" is all about character and humanity, and not so much about giving a traditional plot.  The four main actors here do a fantastic job in ""Closer"" and collectively give the performance of the year.  Natalie Portman is likely going to pick up a Best Supporting Actress Nomination (if not win) for her portrayal of Alice, the all grown up but still somewhat childish waif of a stripper.  Clive Owen, however, steals the show (as does Portman) with every scene he is in.  He is passionate, intense, and perfect.  As is, I would suggest, this movie.  It is not an upbeat movie, but it has such a warmth to it even as the characters are all treating each other really badly.  This is a very impressive movie and one which I sincerely hope gets a Best Picture nomination come Oscar time.-Joe Sherry",5,This is a great movie....buster...,1102291200,"12 6, 2004",2004,2523,"['film', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'Closer', 'film', 'beginnings', 'endings', 'are', 'given', 'look', 'how', 'relationships', 'begin', 'how', 'end', 'Very', 'little', 'what', 'ever', 'seen', 'screen', 'are', 'time', 'gaps', 'story', 'year', 'first', 'gap', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'structure', 'barely', 'noticeable', 'Closer', 'appropriately', 'enough', 'meeting', 'Alice', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Dan', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Alice', 'walking', 'down', 'London', 'sidewalk', 'Dan', 'following', 'observing', ""n't"", 'clear', 'stalking', 'just', 'admiring', 'beauty', 'When', 'Alice', 'wrong', 'way', 'when', 'crossing', 'road', 'American', 'struck', 'car', 'Dan', 'right', 'there', 'get', 'help', 'flirtation', 'relationship.Dan', 'meets', 'Alice', 'Dan', 'Anna', 'Anna', 'Larry', 'Dan', 'Alice', 'Anna', 'Larry', 'Larry', 'Alice', 'call', 'Closer', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'would', 'be', 'do', 'film', 'disservice', 'not', 'mention', 'are', 'four', 'people', 'involved', 'triangle', 'romantic', 'pairings', 'up', 'hooking', 'up', 'method', 'characters', 'use', 'try', 'fulfill', 'something', 'lacking', 'lives', 'real', 'point', 'here', 'conversation', 'about', 'conversation', 'beginning', 'ending', 'relationship', 'most', 'interesting', 'most', 'intense', 'emotions', 'are', 'heightened', 'more', 'focused', 'joy', 'pain', 'dialogue', 'sharp', 'incredibly', 'intelligent', ""'ve"", 'never', 'come', 'conversation', 'life', 'realistic', 'flirtatious', 'very', 'sexual', 'particular', 'dialogue', 'endings', 'relationships', 'quite', 'graphic', 'Closer', 'character', 'humanity', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'giving', 'traditional', 'plot', 'four', 'main', 'actors', 'here', 'do', 'fantastic', 'job', 'Closer', 'collectively', 'give', 'performance', 'year', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'likely', 'going', 'pick', 'up', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Nomination', 'not', 'win', 'portrayal', 'Alice', 'grown', 'up', 'still', 'somewhat', 'childish', 'waif', 'stripper', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'however', 'show', 'Portman', 'scene', 'passionate', 'intense', 'perfect', 'would', 'suggest', 'movie', 'not', 'upbeat', 'movie', 'warmth', 'even', 'characters', 'are', 'treating', 'other', 'really', 'badly', 'very', 'impressive', 'movie', 'one', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nomination', 'come', 'Oscar', 'time.-Joe', 'Sherry']",N/A

884445,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B0007OCG4W,Jonathan Appleseed,"[6, 9]","CLOSER is a film about the strange interplay between four people who richly deserve each other, as well as the disaster that they all bring to each other's lives.The story begins simply enough, with Dan (Jude Law) meeting ""Alice"" (Natalie Portman) on the street. Alice is striking in the crowd: her hair is spiked and fuchsia, and their eyes lock. While waiting at the street corner, Alice is hit by a taxi receiving minor injuries, and Dan, who we already know has an immediate attraction to her, takes her to the hospital where she receives two stitches on her leg. This begins their relationship. Dan gives Alice a very brief tour of London (he is late for work, after all), and the next thing you know it Dan is being photographed by Anna (Julia Roberts) for the author's photo on a book he has published, a book whose heroine is modeled after Alice. During the photo shoot, Dan tells Julia to ""come here"", and after a brief moment she moves forward, and he moves forward to her and they kiss. They both acknowledge involvement with others (indeed, Alice is meeting him there after her shift), and Anna appears to pull away. When Alice arrives, she goes to the bathroom and Dan tells Anna that he has to see her. Unfortunately, Alice heard him while he was in the bathroom, something she communicates to Anna while Anna is photographing her (she had never been professionally photographed, she says, but I believe it was really a ruse to let Anna know what she heard). Anna takes a moving and poignant photograph of tears rolling down Alice's cheeks. She says that she isn't a thief, and comments on how interesting Alice's life is. Alice makes a dismissive comment (I can't remember exactly what it was), but we learn that there isn't only one person being deceptive here - it's quite obvious that Alice has secrets of her own.In a bizarre and rather sexually explicit internet exchange, Dan (impersonating Anna), encourages another man, a dermatologist (Clive Owen as Larry), to meet him (her) at the aquarium. Dan sends him to the aquarium because Anna says that she often goes there. Larry goes, sees Anna (who could miss the description: big mouth, killer ****), and converses with her. It takes only a moment for Dan's deception to be made known.Like a play (which this is taken from), there are large jumps in time. This second jump takes us to a point where Larry and Anna are now in a relationship. This is a bit of a surprise, because Larry doesn't come across as a decent person. Indeed, in a conversation he has with Alice (while Dan and Anna are talking privately), he says, ""sometimes the frog gets the princess"". He may have been referring to his exterior looks, but I read it to be a metaphor for his interior ugliness, as I viewed his character more than any to be in a state of nearly constant moral decay.In the film, people change lovers like underwear, and Anna leaves Larry for Dan, Alice begins stripping after Dan leaves her (although in perhaps a pointed comment she tells Larry that nobody left her), and then they switch back again. ""Closer"" may have a deeper meaning than the one that seems obvious, but this movie seems to me more aptly titled ""How to Screw Up Your Life by Cheating and Lying"".What's of tremendous interest is that each man, after learning that their respective partner (whichever one it was at the time), is intent on knowing the exact particulars of the indiscretion. As Larry acknowledges, he wants to know because he is a caveman. That is certainly a word I would have picked if he hadn't.All four characters began with little innocence, and end with less. We know the least about Anna, but we can judge her by her actions - which are deplorable. Her obvious lack of happiness in the end also speaks volumes. Larry is the most obviously decrepit character, as he brazenly displays his lack of concern and care for others when, mainly, he is seeking some form of revenge. Alice is the character that seems to be the most innocent, but in the end we find out that we really know absolutely nothing about her whatsoever. And Dan - Dan perhaps wants to be as morally reprehensible as Larry, but he lacks the ability to do so. Yes, he is a cheat, a liar, and a thief (in love), but there is an innocence about him. Anna told Larry that he would cry for his mother in his sleep, and this, perhaps, explains much. It also gives us the most information we get regarding Anna and her true feelings for Dan. You don't share secrets like that unless you are making fun of the person.These are four deeply flawed people, but they are four people that it's not difficult to imagine meeting in everyday life.",5,Deception and Lies,1102204800,"12 5, 2004",2004,4648,"['CLOSER', 'film', 'strange', 'interplay', 'four', 'people', 'who', 'richly', 'deserve', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'disaster', 'bring', 'other', 'lives.The', 'story', 'simply', 'enough', 'Dan', 'Jude', 'Law', 'meeting', 'Alice', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'street', 'Alice', 'striking', 'crowd', 'hair', 'spiked', 'fuchsia', 'eyes', 'lock', 'waiting', 'street', 'corner', 'Alice', 'hit', 'taxi', 'receiving', 'minor', 'injuries', 'Dan', 'who', 'already', 'know', 'immediate', 'attraction', 'hospital', 'where', 'two', 'stitches', 'leg', 'relationship', 'Dan', 'Alice', 'very', 'brief', 'tour', 'London', 'late', 'work', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'Dan', 'being', 'photographed', 'Anna', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'author', 'photo', 'book', 'published', 'book', 'heroine', 'modeled', 'Alice', 'photo', 'shoot', 'Dan', 'Julia', 'come', 'here', 'brief', 'moment', 'forward', 'forward', 'kiss', 'acknowledge', 'involvement', 'others', 'indeed', 'Alice', 'meeting', 'there', 'shift', 'Anna', 'pull', 'away', 'When', 'Alice', 'bathroom', 'Dan', 'Anna', 'see', 'Unfortunately', 'Alice', 'heard', 'was', 'bathroom', 'something', 'Anna', 'Anna', 'photographing', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'professionally', 'photographed', 'believe', 'was', 'really', 'ruse', 'let', 'Anna', 'know', 'what', 'heard', 'Anna', 'moving', 'poignant', 'photograph', 'tears', 'rolling', 'down', 'Alice', 'cheeks', ""n't"", 'thief', 'comments', 'how', 'interesting', 'Alice', 'life', 'Alice', 'dismissive', 'comment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'learn', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'person', 'being', 'deceptive', 'here', 'quite', 'obvious', 'Alice', 'secrets', 'own.In', 'bizarre', 'rather', 'sexually', 'explicit', 'internet', 'exchange', 'Dan', 'impersonating', 'Anna', 'man', 'dermatologist', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Larry', 'meet', 'aquarium', 'Dan', 'aquarium', 'Anna', 'often', 'there', 'Larry', 'sees', 'Anna', 'who', 'could', 'miss', 'description', 'big', 'mouth', 'killer', '****', 'converses', 'only', 'moment', 'Dan', 'deception', 'be', 'made', 'play', 'taken', 'are', 'large', 'jumps', 'time', 'second', 'jump', 'point', 'where', 'Larry', 'Anna', 'are', 'now', 'relationship', 'bit', 'surprise', 'Larry', ""n't"", 'come', 'decent', 'person', 'Indeed', 'conversation', 'Alice', 'Dan', 'Anna', 'are', 'talking', 'privately', 'sometimes', 'frog', 'princess', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'referring', 'exterior', 'looks', 'read', 'be', 'metaphor', 'interior', 'ugliness', 'viewed', 'character', 'more', 'be', 'state', 'nearly', 'constant', 'moral', 'decay.In', 'film', 'people', 'change', 'lovers', 'underwear', 'Anna', 'Larry', 'Dan', 'Alice', 'stripping', 'Dan', 'perhaps', 'pointed', 'comment', 'Larry', 'nobody', 'left', 'then', 'switch', 'back', 'again', 'Closer', 'may', 'have', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'one', 'obvious', 'movie', 'more', 'aptly', 'titled', 'How', 'Screw', 'Up', 'Life', 'Cheating', 'Lying', '.What', 'tremendous', 'interest', 'man', 'learning', 'respective', 'partner', 'one', 'was', 'time', 'intent', 'knowing', 'exact', 'particulars', 'indiscretion', 'Larry', 'know', 'caveman', 'certainly', 'word', 'would', 'have', 'picked', ""hadn't.All"", 'four', 'characters', 'began', 'little', 'innocence', 'end', 'less', 'know', 'least', 'Anna', 'can', 'judge', 'actions', 'are', 'deplorable', 'obvious', 'lack', 'happiness', 'end', 'also', 'volumes', 'Larry', 'most', 'obviously', 'decrepit', 'character', 'brazenly', 'lack', 'concern', 'care', 'others', 'when', 'mainly', 'seeking', 'form', 'revenge', 'Alice', 'character', 'be', 'most', 'innocent', 'end', 'find', 'out', 'really', 'know', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'Dan', 'Dan', 'perhaps', 'be', 'morally', 'reprehensible', 'Larry', 'ability', 'do', 'so', 'Yes', 'cheat', 'liar', 'thief', 'love', 'innocence', 'Anna', 'told', 'Larry', 'would', 'cry', 'mother', 'sleep', 'perhaps', 'much', 'also', 'most', 'information', 'get', 'regarding', 'Anna', 'true', 'feelings', 'Dan', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'secrets', 'are', 'making', 'fun', 'person.These', 'are', 'four', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'people', 'are', 'four', 'people', 'not', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'meeting', 'everyday', 'life']",N/A

The first 30 or so minutes were a tad bit slow, but once the film got going, it just flew by.  I usually have a hard time sitting through a whole movie and being engaged in it the whole time.  This film wasn't what I would call deeply moving or anything that substantial, but it was indeed interesting.  It didn't spend a lot of time explaining stuff as it was happening.  Big gaps of time would pass and you had to spend a minute or so realizing that and what had happened in between.  I wouldn't exactly call it a ""character study"", but more of a ""people-study"" perhaps.  There are four main characters and none of them are given preference over the other.  I suppose some of the intrigue that keeps the film interesting is that throughout the film each of the four leads is going through an emotional crisis, wanting to be CLOSER to someone.  During each scene, you see the yearning's perspective, and you kind of root for them to get what they want.  At the same time, in some instances, one wonders if the yearning even knows what he/she really wants.For those wanting an erotic film, don't be fooled by the MPAA's description of their rating.  Aside from some clinical images of a strip club, the porn-lingo is about the only thing ""explicit"" about the film.  None of the leads show any skin.  I suppose that was part of the intrigue, but part of me kinda figured by halfway through the movie, when Clive Owen's head kept blocking Natalie Portman's exposure, that the director didn't want the cast to show their moneymakers, but, rather, the audience to focus on the emotional and philosophical aspects of the sexual content.

(My preconceptions haven't been so shattered since I saw Bambi's mother get shot by hunters at the Saturday kiddie matinee!)CLOSER opens as Alice (Natalie Portman), a New York stripper on a visit to London, is grazed by a car after she's looked left instead of right stepping off the curb. She's taken to the hospital by a stranger, Dan (Jude Law), a writer wannabe with whom she starts a live-in relationship. Then, Dan sits for a formal portrait by photographer Anna (Julia Roberts), on whom he unsuccessfully hits. Subsequently, Larry (Clive Owen), a dermatologist, meets Anna, whom he marries, then divorces after discovering that she's had recent sex with the once-spurned Dan. On the rebound and needing physical comfort, Larry seeks out Alice, now shucking clothes at a London strip club after having left Dan, and whom he'd previously met at one of Anna's photo exhibits. But Dan still pines for Alice and is emotionally devastated that she may have had sex with Larry. Is this messy, or what? (The timeline is murky; apparently all this happens over a couple of years.)CLOSER is a film, painful to watch, of sexual manipulation, possession, and obsession in which the four principal characters inflict emotional cruelties on each other. It's not holiday fare for an afternoon out at the movies with your aged Mum. The language is sexually graphic and, in one sequence of scenes in the London strip joint, visually raunchy. CLOSER is, however, one of the best films of 2004. Julia Roberts is perhaps the biggest surprise as she shows that she can radically transcend - even beyond ERIN BROCKOVICH (2000) - her usual cute roles; I was mightily impressed.It would be hard to pick this film's lead and supporting parts. All four (Portman, Law, Roberts, Owen) have about equal screen time (though I wasn't keeping track with a stopwatch). Any, or all, of them could garner an Oscar nomination.I had begun to doze about a quarter of the way into the film, but then woke up almost with a start as I realized that CLOSER is an exceptional adult film, without visually explicit sex or violence, that brutally shows grown-ups in dysfunctional relationships behaving at their very worst.

I read a few reviews saying there were no likable characters in this film, and while I don't think there are any cookie cutter good guys, I don't think that is true.SpoilersThe movie starts with a romance between Jude Law and Natlie Portman.  Its almost purely physical it seems, and after a while because of the lack of tension he finds attraction with Julia Roberts.  Because he can't have Julia, because she doesn't want to cheat on Natalie, Jude pretends to be her on a sex chat with Clive Owen, in what may be the performance of his career.  He wants to have control over her since he can't exert that in a relationship.  He is not being honest with his partner.  Taking away control from her for selfish reasons.  Julia and Clive really do fall in love and get married, and eventually she runs accross Jude again.  They begin an affair and fall in love each dumping their partners.  In order to get the divorce from Clive, Julia sleeps with him, and Jude dumps her because he can't take the knowledge and the control taken away from him.  Jude eventually wisens up and goes back to face Clive, who tells him there is no way he is getting Julia back, but he knows where Natalie is and he should go back there.  But before Jude leaves, he has to exert control, and tells him the reason he knows where she is, is because he slept with her after Julia dumped him.  Jude and Natalie get back together, but Natalie denies sleeping with Clive.  Time passes and Jude begs for the truth because it is eating him up, and Natalie admits to it, before breaking up with him.  That was her control in the relationship, and having to give that up again is too painful, and she leaves.  It is revealed ingeniously that she had more control that thought because she did love him, and she had to protect herself, where as she did not with Clive because it was just sex.  its about protecting our emotions in an oversexed world.  A lot of people don't like Clive and Natalie because they had sex, but they were both single and consenting adults, but Natalie is pure enough to get away.

884453,A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2,B0007OCG4W,Josh Hitchens,"[6, 7]","First of all, let me say that I am a huge fan of Patrick Marber's play ""Closer."" I think it is one of the most honest and brutal pieces ever written about the pain we enter into when we fall in love. The movie, despite being written by Marber, falls far short of his play, taking away a lot of the darkness and complexity and replacing it with a new ending that doesn't do the rest of the film justice. ""Closer"" is well-directed by Mike Nichols, although the majority of the praise must be given to the four actors who hold the movie together: Jude Law, Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, and Natalie Portman.""Closer"" is about a quartet of strangers who meet in contemporary London, fall in love, and then destroy one another over the course of four years. Dan (Jude Law) meets the mysterious ex-stripper Alice (Natalie Portman) on the street and saves her from being killed by a speeding car. Dan is entranced by Alice, and the two begin a relationship. He writes a book based on her life, and is photographed by Anna (Julia Roberts). Dan becomes obsessed with Anna, and wants to be with her at all costs. Meanwhile, as a result of a wickedly funny chat room conversation, Dan causes Anna to meet Larry (Clive Owen). The two hit it off, and eventually get married.What I have just described is only the beginning of ""Closer."" The four characters engage in a brutal game of musical beds, hurting one another not with lies, but by telling the truth. The film's most wrenching scene is when Dan tells Alice he has been sleeping with Anna, and Anna reveals to Larry that she's been unfaithful to him for a year. The dialogue between these people is physically painful to watch, because it is so ugly and so honest. If the rest of the movie could have been as bracing, ""Closer"" would have been a masterpiece. As it is, the play's sharp edges have been dulled to create a film with much less bite.The best part of ""Closer"" is the acting. Jude Law does an excellent job of showing us the wounded little boy behind Dan's sharp facade, crying like a baby when he can't have what he wants most. Julia Roberts is miscast as Anna, a role which was originally supposed to be played by Cate Blanchett. This is the hardest acting job Roberts has ever been given, and it is out of her range. However, Roberts turns in a very good performance, one of her best, even if it falls short of what it could have been. Clive Owen, who is mostly unknown to American audiences, is a nice surprise as Larry, at turns brokenhearted and coldhearted. The most devastating performance is given by Natalie Portman, who inhabits the damaged Alice so well that we forget what actress we're watching. Portman's Alice can be a burning beacon of sexuality when she wants to be, but underneath that is a frightened, lonely little girl, which makes us pity her. Although Marber's screenplay robs her of some of her original complexity, Natalie Portman turns in a brave and exciting performance, one that should cement her as one of the most promising actresses of her generation.I do think ""Closer"" is worth seeing. If you are unfamiliar with the play on which it is based, you will enjoy it more than I did. It boasts some incredible acting and skilled direction by the great Mike Nichols. It's not an easy film to watch or an easy play to read. Because it refutes the notion that love is something beautiful and cuddly, that it is in fact, hard and painful, and sometimes glorious. As Larry says, ""Have you ever seen a human heart? It looks like a fist, wrapped in blood.""",3,"""Closer"" Misses the Mark",1105142400,"01 8, 2005",2005,3528,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Patrick', 'Marber', 'play', 'Closer', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'honest', 'brutal', 'pieces', 'ever', 'written', 'pain', 'enter', 'when', 'fall', 'love', 'movie', 'being', 'written', 'Marber', 'far', 'short', 'play', 'taking', 'away', 'lot', 'darkness', 'complexity', 'replacing', 'new', 'ending', ""n't"", 'do', 'rest', 'film', 'justice', 'Closer', 'well-directed', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'majority', 'praise', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'four', 'actors', 'who', 'hold', 'movie', 'together', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Closer', 'quartet', 'strangers', 'who', 'meet', 'contemporary', 'London', 'fall', 'love', 'then', 'destroy', 'one', 'course', 'four', 'years', 'Dan', 'Jude', 'Law', 'mysterious', 'ex-stripper', 'Alice', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'street', 'being', 'killed', 'speeding', 'car', 'Dan', 'entranced', 'Alice', 'two', 'begin', 'relationship', 'book', 'based', 'life', 'photographed', 'Anna', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Dan', 'obsessed', 'Anna', 'be', 'costs', 'Meanwhile', 'result', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'chat', 'room', 'conversation', 'Dan', 'Anna', 'meet', 'Larry', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'two', 'hit', 'off', 'eventually', 'get', 'married.What', 'have', 'just', 'described', 'only', 'beginning', 'Closer', 'four', 'characters', 'engage', 'brutal', 'game', 'musical', 'beds', 'hurting', 'one', 'not', 'lies', 'telling', 'truth', 'film', 'most', 'wrenching', 'scene', 'when', 'Dan', 'Alice', 'been', 'sleeping', 'Anna', 'Anna', 'reveals', 'Larry', 'been', 'unfaithful', 'year', 'dialogue', 'people', 'physically', 'painful', 'watch', 'so', 'ugly', 'so', 'honest', 'rest', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bracing', 'Closer', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'masterpiece', 'play', 'sharp', 'edges', 'have', 'been', 'dulled', 'create', 'film', 'much', 'less', 'bite.The', 'best', 'part', 'Closer', 'acting', 'Jude', 'Law', 'excellent', 'job', 'showing', 'wounded', 'little', 'boy', 'Dan', 'sharp', 'facade', 'crying', 'baby', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'what', 'most', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'miscast', 'Anna', 'role', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'be', 'played', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'hardest', 'acting', 'job', 'Roberts', 'ever', 'been', 'given', 'range', 'However', 'Roberts', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'even', 'short', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'who', 'mostly', 'unknown', 'American', 'audiences', 'nice', 'surprise', 'Larry', 'turns', 'brokenhearted', 'coldhearted', 'most', 'devastating', 'performance', 'given', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'who', 'damaged', 'Alice', 'so', 'well', 'forget', 'what', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Portman', 'Alice', 'can', 'be', 'burning', 'beacon', 'sexuality', 'when', 'be', 'frightened', 'lonely', 'little', 'girl', 'Marber', 'screenplay', 'original', 'complexity', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'brave', 'exciting', 'performance', 'one', 'should', 'cement', 'one', 'most', 'promising', 'actresses', 'generation.I', 'do', 'think', 'Closer', 'worth', 'seeing', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'play', 'based', 'will', 'enjoy', 'more', 'did', 'incredible', 'acting', 'skilled', 'direction', 'great', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'easy', 'play', 'read', 'notion', 'love', 'something', 'beautiful', 'cuddly', 'fact', 'hard', 'painful', 'sometimes', 'glorious', 'Larry', 'Have', 'ever', 'seen', 'human', 'heart', 'fist', 'wrapped', 'blood']",N/A

884456,ARLKYF9JL3QKB,B0007OCG4W,J. SHARP,"[18, 23]","That may seem an unfair summary of this film but - basically - that's all it ends up being. For all its witty sound and prurient fury about honesty and deception, love and hate, pleasure and pain, it essentially signifies nothing. All the players end back up at square one having learned absolutely nothing apart from trusting no one (although they never really did that to begin with).None of the characters even approach being sympathetic. Law's writer is an egotistical, controlling stalker. Owen's doctor is a crude, arrogant sadist. Roberts' photographer is a masochistic depressive with a theoretical conscience but no judgment whatsover. Portman's stripper is clingy yet militantly aloof. And all of them are casual liars who tell the truth only when it will either do maximum emotional damage to the hearer or won't be believed due to their track record.Sex is used by these people not only as a weapon but as a torture device and verbal bludgeon. Every time there's an infidelity, the offendee launches into a loud, graphic verbal description of all the imagined acts, demanding the most brutal details in the coarsest possible terms until the offender is nothing but a blubbering pulp.In fact, I think sex is referred to as ""sex"" only once or twice in the whole film. The rest of the time it's called by it's most vulgar names. No one ever simply has sex, makes love, sleeps with, or even screws with someone else. It's always F, F, F, F, F (repeat 150 times) no matter the emotional or societal context. Maybe some people talk like this but I was in the Navy and I never even heard sailors be so obsessive about calling it that and nothing else.Which brings me to the unintentional message of this supposed monument to ""realism."" One comes away from ""Closer"" with a suspicion that it is a stark portrait of the way many people in the show business bubble go about love and marriage. They seem (like teenagers almost) passionately devoted to the dramatic sturm und drang of relationships - rather than to their mates. Lots of shock and awe but no real commitment.Do I like anything about this movie? Admittedly, yes.As noted above, Marber's writing can be witty and just plain artful - stylistically anyway. The decision to retain the theatrical progression of the story - a series of vignettes featuring the conversational turning points rather than the acts that cause them - is an iffy proposition but is at least refreshing. Many were perturbed that the skipping of large tracts of time is handled in passing mentions rather than titles on the screen but it certainly keeps you focused on the dialogue!There are also fleeting moments of casual dishonesty among the characters that made me flinch in self-recognition.The acting in ""Closer"" is not only top-notch but occasionally brilliant. This is easily some of the best work you'll see all year. Making these characters anything other than caricatures took some chops, let me tell you. Even though they are - with the exception of Clive Owen - overexposed faces, they do an admirable job of suspending disbelief. Owen certainly deserves this day in the American sun. And Natalie Portman continues to improve exponentially. She chews this role up and spits it in your face. Her Golden Globe nomination may be arguable but it's certainly understandable.",3,Four people use each other and scream about it.

884461,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B0007OCG4W,Kaya Savas,"[1, 1]","MOVIE: In reality I would give this film three stars instead of four. The premise is very unreal, very over the top, and just too vivid at times. But it is powerful and has a certain style. What makes this film entertaining are the actors and Mike Nichols. The movie revolves between two couples. At first they love each other then they don't, now they do, now they don't. It jumps around a lot and that shows one major flaw of the movie. At some points the movie jumps huge amounts of time, at one point it was a year. Basically skipping all the build up in the relationship and just showing the intense parts of it. I agree that this was the best way of doing this, but I just felt not involved with the movie since all we are seeing are bullets on a timeline of events. The movie is intense at times and is revealing of a darker more perverse side of human nature, love. The movie explores just how twisted the human heart is as well as the mind. Some of the dialogue is very explicit. And what makes the movie so unique is that Mike Nichols was able to take all this harshness of humanity and turn it into a very delicate film. As you watch the movie, you get a sense that the lives of these people are so fragile even though their emotions, if unleashed, could devour a corpse. I just found it interesting how they were able to craft the film so well.ACTING: The acting in the movie was great and believable. Natalie Portman plays a similar role to Kate Winslet in Eternal Sunshine, but just a little more fragile. Julie Roberts is the elegant woman, Jude Law the desperate man, and Clive Owen the butcher. I'm a big fan of Clive Owen and I thought he delivered a very chilling performance here. Again, the acting made the movie. Oscar winning director, Mike Nichols, also gave the movie its style. If it weren't for the talent of the actors and the crew I assure you that this movie would be very mediocre.BOTTOM LINE: Entertaining and fun, but not at all thought provoking. You'll be impacted by the intense acting and dialogue, but underneath it there's really nothing there. I was really never intending to see this movie, but when Sideways was sold out this was the second choice.

I regretfully have not read Marber's play yet, but this movie makes me want to read it even more now.""Closer"" revolves around 2 couples who switch back and forth both sexually and emotionally with love, lust, truth, lies, and betrayal.  Julia Roberts plays Anna, an American photographer who meets Dan (Jude Law) when he hires her to take his photo for his novel that will eventually fail to sell.  He is in a relationship with Alice (played wonderfully by Natalie Portman) but she knows that the knots are coming undone with their relationship and confronts Anna on Dan's attraction to her immediately.  Anna ends up getting married to a dermatologist played well by Clive Owen who she meets accidentally on purpose because of a practical joke by Dan.  (You have to see it to believe it.)The viewer sees these 4 people get mixed up with each other and while they are all messed up in their own ways, Alice comes across as being the most stable by the end of the movie.  What I noticed when watching it is the quest from both the male characters to know the absolute truth from their partners.  Dan begs both Anna and Alice to give him the truth, but when he receives it, he can't handle it.  Owen's character (I can't remember if it's Larry or Harry) is brute, blunt, crass, and a bit too [...] for my tastes, but he knows how to play with the emotions and thoughts of Dan when it comes to both Anna and Alice.If anything, this movie is a bit brutal in that it doesn't sugarcoat these relationships.  I thought the ending had an interesting twist with it that I didn't expect.  I also liked the way Nichols filmed the movie.  I liked how this movie focused on sex and sexual relationships, but there wasn't one sex scene.  It was smart on Nichols part in my opinion.I think a lot of movies pertaining to relationships are geared towards teenagers and young adults, but aren't realistic and gripping.  This is a smart relationship movie that puts the viewer through the ringer, but love isn't always about chocolate boxes and roses.Once again, Natalie Portman's performance was excellent and I do believe that she should be considered for a Best Supporting nomination come Oscar time.

You just know it will all end in tears.Your sympathy really goes out to Natalie Portman's character, Alice, a stripper who loves Jude Law, a selfish journalist, just too much. Clive Owen, on the other hand, is great as the conniving, manipulative, disturbing doctor Dan. Portman and Owen thoroughly deserve their Golden Globe awards - their acting is powerful with real screen presence. Jude Law delivers another strong performance, with only Julia Roberts seeming a little subdued; though her lacklustre, tired performance balances out well with Portman's usual energetic, lively gusto.The crude language used to depict ""real people"" in ""modern relationships"" was obviously designed to shock but is it really necessary? Do people really talk to each other like this, never mind supposedly sophisticated couples? Some viewers might find the Owen/Portman strip club scenes uncomfortable to watch if cuddling up with their own partner for what is essentially a great couples film; but then, this sleazy underworld is only a small part of what is really a sweet story at heart.The London scenery serves as a great backdrop for the two American girls living with their Englishmen. This is the kind of movie you can watch over and over again that will make you appreciate your own relationship or wish you were in a new one - though don't be tempted to copy the characters in this film because, as they found out, cheating only brings heartache and unhappiness.Only disappointment with Closer is the lack of Special Features on the DVD - the single extra is a pop video for the haunting Damien Rice theme song The Blower's Daughter, so perfect for this picture. Cinemagoers who spend their money again on favourite films when they come out on DVD expect a little extra like director's and actor's commentary, deleted scenes, star interviews, making-of-movie features. Apparently there was a lot of footage left over from the final cut of this movie - extras are what makes collecting DVD so special.

884468,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B0007OCG4W,Kenji Fujishima,"[11, 15]","One of the previous reviewers of Mike Nichols' CLOSER called it ""one of the most raw and honest portrayals of 21st century relationships."" Sorry if this offends you, ma'am, but if you find Patrick Marber's hopelessly sour depiction of 21st century relationships truthful---if you agree with his implicit argument that people in our modern times have lost the ability to truly love each other and be honest with each other in relationships, no matter how hard they may try to make a show of affection and honesty---then I can only imagine what hurt you've gone through in your romantic life to lead you to make a similar conclusion.CLOSER is the sad chronicle of four lives ruined by cheating, lying, and manipulation. Anna the photographer (Julia Roberts) breaks the heart of Larry the dermatologist (Clive Owen) by sleeping with Dan the writer (Jude Law), who himself breaks the heart of Alice the stripper (Natalie Portman). The movie basically follows these four characters as they all hurt each other, some willingly, some unwillingly. There are very few scenes that elicit any sense of hope for these people; they remain self-absorbed and plain selfish from beginning to end.So, these are not very likable characters. Not a problem, necessarily; I've seen plenty of movies and TV shows in the past that have had unappealing characters, but have been so well written and insightfully performed that I nevertheless feel compelled to observe these characters during the course of the film or episode. (An example: the hit TV show ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" can sometimes make you wince more than laugh---especially when someone get Patricia Heaton's Debra Barone angry!---but I still maintain an admiration for its occasional priceless insights into family life, even in the midst of crazy family dysfunction.) Likewise, I might have accepted the bald manipulations of these four nasty specimens more readily if the movie actually highlighted some startling truths about modern relationships. The cynical side of me is perfectly willing to accept the filmmakers' notion that people these days have become a little more selfish in love. But the way Marber presents his thesis here, there is no connection to anything resembling real life---especially in his dialogue, which can be impressive when it doesn't simply sound all-too-written---to ground his misanthropic ideas in some kind of realistic footing. The result is a movie that seems less like an expose of harsh truths, more like a grotesque fantasy about glamorous people mindlessly inflicting terrible emotional pain on each other.I can't really fault the performances, though---at least Natalie Portman's and Clive Owen's. It was an inspired decision to cast the innocent-looking Portman as the stripper who gets hurt by Dan and wisens up considerably afterwards; Portman relays an occasionally touching vulnerability (although, admittedly, that is the only note Portman really emphasizes in her performance here), and Nichols smartly mines it for irony in the film's closing scenes. Clive Owen also burrows into his role with all the intensity and emotional honesty he can find from a role that requires him to be hurt and angry in one scene, and then coldly vengeful the next, almost on a dime. As for Jude Law and Julia Roberts...well, Law plays his character like such a sensitive fellow that you sometimes can't believe that this timid-seeming man could brutally hurt Alice the way he does. And while Roberts effectively dials down the movie-star wattage here, she does seem somewhat ill at ease in parts of this movie. When she hurls sexual obscenities at Larry in one scene, Roberts' delivery makes those words sting with all the power of a dead bee.But perhaps one shouldn't blame Law or Roberts if they have trouble giving consistent performances in this movie. Their roles are in the service of a shallow vision of modern relationships that seems so divorced from any sense of reality that any actor might have trouble trying to find any kind of emotional truth in this kind of role.

884469,A1ZKAHFYCJRGQM,B0007OCG4W,Kenneth V. Cockrel,"[5, 7]","In this film's four-star constellation of actors, Clive Owen's star probably shines the dimmest.  But make no mistake about it, he rules this movie.Owen gives an incendiary performance as one fourth of a romantic quadrangle of lovers who are alternately in each others pants and at each other's throats.  Owen, of course, is the British actor who is most often mentioned as the man most likely to be the next James Bond.  And though you can see the Bond suaveness here, this is a film that requires him to turn up the hostility on a dime.  To see Clive Owen in this film to see the modern male as 21st Century caveman.This is not to slight the work of Julia Roberts, Jude Law, and Natalie Portman.  All give uniformly superb performances in what is a sharply written and deftly directed ensemble film.  All praise is due to director Mike Nichols and playwright Patrick Marber whose play the film adapts.But it's Owen who towers in this film like Shaquille O'Neal in a kindergarten class.  Watching the film, you almost hope the Bond thing never happens since the O07 role has been a both a blessing and a curse to every actor that's played the role.Though Sean Connery gave it up by the early seventies it took him more than a decade to climb out of Bond's shadow and become a known as a bankable actor who could do more than shake a martini and fire a gun.  One time Bond George Lazenby was basiclly never heard from again after ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service.""  Roger Moore's most notable recent projects have included ""Boat Trip"" and the Spice Girls movie while Timothy Dalton seems to be toiling away in the relative obscurity of made for  TV family movies.As for Pierce Brosnan, though he's tried admirably to take diverse roles while also carrying the Bond mantle, it's too early to tell if his career will go anywhere but down now that he's parking the Astin Martin in Q's garage for good.That's why it would frankly be better not to see Clive Owen don the Bond tux.  Performances like the one he gives in ""Closer"" show that he's just too good for it.",5,It's Clive Owen's world.

884473,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0007OCG4W,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[2, 5]","A relationship commences the instant two individuals meet.  Eye contact leads to conversation which builds a connection between the people involved in the mutual communication.  This moment of communication is occasionally emotionally loaded where the involved begin to explore each other's compatibilities.  If there is a mutual harmony the conversation usually progresses.  However, communication is not the only thing needed for a romantic relationship, as the possibility of physical closeness where an opportunity of sharing thoughts, feelings, and secrets brings about a bond of trust.  Trust is what unites people, as they let the other closer into themselves with the intention of mutual expectation of protection and nurturing love.  Some have much difficulty building this trust as it can take years after a painful memory when their trust once was broken.  Closer brings the audience the moment where trust begins and ends in a visual dissection of human emotions where pain, suffering, love, trust, and much more are explored.Closer offers a Bergmanesque experience which dives deep into the psyche of the four main characters of the story.  Through the four characters the audience is allowed into a secret and personal world, a world most can identify through self scrutiny.  In a sense, Closer comes closer to the audience, as the mirror of our thoughts and feelings creeps slowly closer until we can feel the cold reflective surface pressing against our noses.  Yet, it is also distinctively unique as the situation, location, and the words that are said are strange and unfamiliar to the audience, as the viewers bring their own notions, experiences, values, and morals to the viewing of the film.  Nonetheless, the director Mike Nichols, with the help of the four talented actors in the film, brings the audience a long painful lesson of how people are getting closer to one another.The story opens in London with Dan (Jude Law) taking his morning stroll to work, as he does everyday, when he stumbles across a refreshing sight in the American girl Alice (Natalie Portman).  Alice is accidentally hit by a car which brings them closer for the moment, as their closeness to one another continues through Dan's nurturing care for Alice's injury.  Initially they study each other visually, through words, and touch, as they begin to build an emotional bond through humor and personal thoughts.  This is the beginning of a romantic relationship that brings them close, but it does not eliminate a tiny space between them as Dan never truly gives himself to Alice.  It appears as if Dan is looking for something else, yet he is not really sure what it is he is looking for, but he seems to be looking for something better.  Yet, Dan remains within the relationship, maybe out of convenience and because he does not want to hurt Alice.  The mental absence of Dan creates an emotional distance between them, which Alice feels strongly as she senses a looming pain being sent her way at any moment through Dan leaving her.Through a couple of years of living together Dan has reached more success as a writer, maybe with the emotional support of Alice, and he is to take a picture for his upcoming book.  Taking the picture is a stunning American, Anna (Julia Roberts), who tells Dan that she liked his book, as he notices portraits around in the photo studio that catch his eye.  This begins an infatuation between Anna and Dan.  It seems as if Dan seeks someone equally successful that can provide additional emotional support to elevate his career.  In a sense, Dan seems to be an emotional opportunist that craves affection, yet he is incapable of fully providing for others who need it as much.On the internet, in a chat room, Dan pretends to be Anna where he meets Larry (Clive Owen), a medical doctor, as they preoccupy themselves with cybersex.  Eventually, this chatting leads to them planning a rendezvous at the city aquarium, as Dan has learned that Anna likes to find people there to take their portrait.  Larry who is all excited about the planned meeting finds himself in a somewhat awkward situation, as he realizes that he has been set up.  Nonetheless, Anna and Larry seem to find each other, as they begin to date through Dan's little prank which turns him into cupid.The film continues to explore more of the four characters personal psychology, and what drives them to do what they are doing.  Nichols cleverly depicts how they get closer through terrific visuals and a well-written script, which balances the brilliant performances of the small cast.  The visuals bring out their unique personalities through delicately balanced contrasts, warm and cold lighting, and mise-en-scene that offers both closeness and distance.  These visual elements enhance the emotionally painful moments where the cast must bring out the best of themselves in order to make it feel authentic, which they do to perfection.  This makes the lines sound vibrant and alive while hurtful and loving words are exchanged in the privacy of the characters.  At last, the film offers a poignantly brilliant cinematic experience that tears the soul and rips the heart while they all are trying to find a way to get closer to one another.",5,A Poignantly Riviting Bergmanesque Experience...,1113091200,"04 10, 2005",2005,5238,"['relationship', 'instant', 'two', 'individuals', 'meet', 'Eye', 'contact', 'conversation', 'connection', 'people', 'involved', 'mutual', 'communication', 'moment', 'communication', 'occasionally', 'emotionally', 'loaded', 'where', 'involved', 'begin', 'explore', 'other', 'compatibilities', 'mutual', 'harmony', 'conversation', 'usually', 'However', 'communication', 'not', 'only', 'thing', 'needed', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'possibility', 'physical', 'closeness', 'where', 'opportunity', 'sharing', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'secrets', 'bond', 'trust', 'Trust', 'what', 'unites', 'people', 'let', 'other', 'closer', 'intention', 'mutual', 'expectation', 'protection', 'nurturing', 'love', 'have', 'much', 'difficulty', 'building', 'trust', 'can', 'take', 'years', 'painful', 'memory', 'when', 'trust', 'once', 'was', 'broken', 'Closer', 'audience', 'moment', 'where', 'trust', 'visual', 'dissection', 'human', 'emotions', 'where', 'pain', 'suffering', 'love', 'trust', 'much', 'more', 'are', 'explored.Closer', 'offers', 'Bergmanesque', 'experience', 'deep', 'psyche', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'story', 'four', 'characters', 'audience', 'allowed', 'secret', 'personal', 'world', 'world', 'most', 'can', 'identify', 'self', 'scrutiny', 'sense', 'Closer', 'closer', 'audience', 'mirror', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'creeps', 'slowly', 'closer', 'can', 'feel', 'cold', 'reflective', 'surface', 'pressing', 'noses', 'Yet', 'also', 'distinctively', 'unique', 'situation', 'location', 'words', 'are', 'said', 'are', 'strange', 'unfamiliar', 'audience', 'viewers', 'bring', 'own', 'notions', 'experiences', 'values', 'morals', 'viewing', 'film', 'Nonetheless', 'director', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'help', 'four', 'talented', 'actors', 'film', 'audience', 'long', 'painful', 'lesson', 'how', 'people', 'are', 'getting', 'closer', 'one', 'another.The', 'story', 'London', 'Dan', 'Jude', 'Law', 'taking', 'morning', 'stroll', 'work', 'everyday', 'when', 'refreshing', 'sight', 'American', 'girl', 'Alice', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Alice', 'accidentally', 'hit', 'car', 'closer', 'moment', 'closeness', 'one', 'Dan', 'nurturing', 'care', 'Alice', 'injury', 'Initially', 'study', 'other', 'visually', 'words', 'touch', 'begin', 'build', 'emotional', 'bond', 'humor', 'personal', 'thoughts', 'beginning', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'close', 'not', 'eliminate', 'tiny', 'space', 'Dan', 'never', 'truly', 'Alice', 'Dan', 'looking', 'something', 'else', 'yet', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'looking', 'be', 'looking', 'something', 'better', 'Dan', 'relationship', 'maybe', 'convenience', 'not', 'want', 'hurt', 'Alice', 'mental', 'absence', 'Dan', 'emotional', 'distance', 'Alice', 'feels', 'strongly', 'looming', 'pain', 'being', 'sent', 'way', 'moment', 'Dan', 'leaving', 'her.Through', 'couple', 'years', 'living', 'together', 'Dan', 'reached', 'more', 'success', 'writer', 'maybe', 'emotional', 'support', 'Alice', 'take', 'picture', 'upcoming', 'book', 'Taking', 'picture', 'stunning', 'American', 'Anna', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'who', 'Dan', 'liked', 'book', 'portraits', 'photo', 'studio', 'eye', 'infatuation', 'Anna', 'Dan', 'Dan', 'someone', 'equally', 'successful', 'can', 'provide', 'additional', 'emotional', 'support', 'elevate', 'career', 'sense', 'Dan', 'be', 'emotional', 'opportunist', 'affection', 'incapable', 'fully', 'providing', 'others', 'who', 'need', 'much.On', 'internet', 'chat', 'room', 'Dan', 'be', 'Anna', 'where', 'Larry', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'medical', 'doctor', 'preoccupy', 'cybersex', 'Eventually', 'chatting', 'planning', 'rendezvous', 'city', 'aquarium', 'Dan', 'learned', 'Anna', 'find', 'people', 'there', 'take', 'portrait', 'Larry', 'who', 'excited', 'planned', 'meeting', 'somewhat', 'awkward', 'situation', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'Nonetheless', 'Anna', 'Larry', 'seem', 'find', 'other', 'begin', 'date', 'Dan', 'little', 'prank', 'cupid.The', 'film', 'explore', 'more', 'four', 'characters', 'personal', 'psychology', 'what', 'do', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'Nichols', 'cleverly', 'how', 'get', 'closer', 'terrific', 'visuals', 'well-written', 'script', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'small', 'cast', 'visuals', 'bring', 'out', 'unique', 'personalities', 'delicately', 'balanced', 'contrasts', 'warm', 'cold', 'lighting', 'mise-en-scene', 'closeness', 'distance', 'visual', 'elements', 'enhance', 'emotionally', 'painful', 'moments', 'where', 'cast', 'must', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'order', 'make', 'feel', 'authentic', 'do', 'perfection', 'lines', 'sound', 'vibrant', 'alive', 'while', 'hurtful', 'loving', 'words', 'are', 'exchanged', 'privacy', 'characters', 'last', 'film', 'poignantly', 'brilliant', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'soul', 'heart', 'are', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'closer', 'one']",N/A

They all end up in relationships with one another, and there's countless times where they would cheat on each other, leave one for another, get back with the old person, and break up again and use sex to hurt eachother. What was the point here? Maybe it was that these characters had confused love for sex? I'm not for sure, but it made for an extremely boring, uneventful and repetitive hour and 40 minutes.For me, when the story really started to dissipate anything interesting, was towards the beginning when the writer (Jude Law) has cyber sex with the doctor (Clive Owen), pretending he's the photographer named Anna (Julia Roberts) for whom he is in love. And by getting back at Anna for not wanting to be with him, he sets up a date with the perverted doctor and tells him to meet ""her"" somewhere, a place he know Anna often visits. The most ridiculous part was when the doctor approaches Anna thinking he's meeting her for a sex date (knowing what she looks like from the description the writer gave him online) and she has no idea what he is talking about. She then tells him that he is the victim of a practical joke set up by a man. But then she ends up marrying him.

Given that the cast was starry and the script was intelligent, how could everyone be so wrong about this comedy hidden behind an incredibly handsome script?This is, indeed, a comedy. The ridiculous situations these people put themselves in had me laughing out loud over and over again. Julia Roberts was so funny as a vitimized victim -- the victim of her own foolishness -- that it was humorous.Jude Law, who starts out the one with the best handle on everything, that gets both women he wants, then ends up being the one most humiliated by a guy named Larry (Clive Owen) (being named Larry, I know what kind of roles are handed out to people named that) that it is, in the end, the pinnacle of comic irony.I think it would be easier to accept this film on face value if the four people involved were regular people. Since instead they are a writer, artist/photographer, stripper and doctor, I think you have to accept that these are not really people; they are actors playing out thinly veiled Hollywood cliches doing things handed to them from a script.The relationship to real life is negligible, at best, since their actions are the equivalent of my 20-year-old college girlfriend who regularly had more than one boyfriend. They are not the actions of mature 35-year-olds, which describe three of the participants.As comedy with irony interwoven, I think this film is successful in its display of human nature. But as a movie about dysfunctional relationships it is less successful that many smaller films and closer to being ordinary. Thankfully, at least one person saw the humor in this arrangement.This film most reminded me of Mike Nichols' now 40-year-old masterpiece, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"", another blockbuster about a pair of dysfunctional couples. Only that movie was played straight.

Carol ""carolcecilia, D.V.""","[2, 3]","If you had absolutely no idea what ""Closer"" was all about before you walked into the cinema, you would have thought that you were catching a romantic comedy about couples played by two major/two up-and-coming stars. Alas, the movie title was but a red herring, one that was meant to be no more than a sarcastic misnomer, as the movie turned out to be nothing less than an intensive study of what truly sucked in man-woman/boy-girl relationships. Not trying to stand on any high moral grounds but here's an observation: the movie put on a grand display of protagonists who had the faintest notion of what love was all about, people who were pros in professing empty words of ""love"" ad nauseam, those who thought not with their heads but consistently allowed lust/emotions/selfishness to get the better of them.Overall, the screenplay was well written and hilarious at times (uproarious laughters could be heard vibrating throughout the cinema during the cyber-sex and follow-up scenes), but got progressively darker from that point onwards. The real stars of the show wasn't America's highest paid actress, Julia Roberts, but the male leads - Jude Law and Clive Owen - who tackled difficult reverse role models with great panache. Natalie Portman also gave a surprisingly earnest portrayal in both substance and form - much had been said about her gratuitous, virtually no-holds barred revealing strip dance sequences so I shan't be repetitive here.Towards the end of the movie, the director would attempt to lead viewers astray, misleading you into thinking that things may not be as bleak, that there could possibly be a big, white hope of the future for these characters.  Don't be fooled. I won't spoil it but watch out for the clever twist at the end. That was a nice finishing touch reverberating the central premise that ran seamlessly throughout the movie, dispelling any possible morsel of sympathy you may have developed for these characters.",4,A Sarcastic Look At Dysfunctional Relationships,1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,1951,"['had', 'absolutely', 'idea', 'what', 'Closer', 'was', 'walked', 'cinema', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'were', 'catching', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'couples', 'played', 'two', 'major/two', 'up-and-coming', 'stars', 'Alas', 'movie', 'title', 'was', 'red', 'herring', 'one', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'sarcastic', 'misnomer', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'nothing', 'less', 'intensive', 'study', 'what', 'truly', 'sucked', 'man-woman/boy-girl', 'relationships', 'Not', 'trying', 'stand', 'high', 'moral', 'grounds', 'here', 'observation', 'movie', 'put', 'grand', 'display', 'protagonists', 'who', 'had', 'faintest', 'notion', 'what', 'love', 'was', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'pros', 'professing', 'empty', 'words', 'love', 'ad', 'nauseam', 'who', 'thought', 'not', 'heads', 'consistently', 'allowed', 'lust/emotions/selfishness', 'get', 'better', 'them.Overall', 'screenplay', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'hilarious', 'times', 'uproarious', 'laughters', 'could', 'be', 'heard', 'vibrating', 'cinema', 'cyber-sex', 'follow-up', 'scenes', 'got', 'progressively', 'darker', 'point', 'onwards', 'real', 'stars', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'America', 'highest', 'paid', 'actress', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'male', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'who', 'tackled', 'difficult', 'reverse', 'role', 'models', 'great', 'panache', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'also', 'gave', 'surprisingly', 'earnest', 'portrayal', 'substance', 'form', 'much', 'had', 'been', 'said', 'gratuitous', 'virtually', 'no-holds', 'barred', 'revealing', 'strip', 'dance', 'sequences', 'so', 'sha', ""n't"", 'be', 'repetitive', 'here.Towards', 'end', 'movie', 'director', 'would', 'attempt', 'lead', 'viewers', 'astray', 'misleading', 'thinking', 'things', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'bleak', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'big', 'white', 'hope', 'future', 'characters', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'watch', 'out', 'clever', 'twist', 'end', 'was', 'nice', 'finishing', 'touch', 'reverberating', 'central', 'premise', 'ran', 'seamlessly', 'movie', 'dispelling', 'possible', 'morsel', 'sympathy', 'may', 'have', 'developed', 'characters']",N/A

884481,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0007OCG4W,Lee Armstrong,"[49, 56]","""Closer"" is a heavyweight breathtaking drama that rivets the viewer's attention.  The characters are not entirely likable, although each is eminently watchable.  Director Mike Nichols won the Oscar for Best Director for ""The Graduate"" in 1967 and has been nominated 3 other times for ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" (1966), ""Silkwood"" (1983), & ""Working Girl"" (1988).  Along with films like ""Primary Colors"" and the TV mini-series ""Angels in America,"" he has an unparalleled ear for dialogue.  No, it's not particularly pleasant.  No, these are not the people your pastor hopes you will be.  But each of these characters represent needs and desires that are shared by most people and are as confused by them as are many.  Patrick Marber's screenplay adaptation of his stage drama is heart-wrenchingly truthful.Of the four strong performances here, the most revelatory for me was Julia Roberts' portrayal of American photographer Anna living in London.  She is selfish but has a conscience.  She takes what she wants, but tries not to admit to it.  In the scene with Larry where she breaks up her marriage, it is some of the best screen time of her career.  When Larry grills her on the details of her sexual relationship with Dan, her zinger about the taste of his semen, ""It's like yours only sweeter"" is like a bullet shot from a gun.  It recalls the Elizabeth Taylor line in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,"" ""You can take it; you married me for it.""  It is utterly fearless and brilliant.  What a raw amazing performance!As Dan, Jude Law turns is an edgy self-effacing performance that adds to his reputation as one of the great young actors.  His scenes with Natalie Portman are enhanced by their similar pairing in ""Cold Mountain.""  On camera, Law is magnetic.  As Dan, the writer of the newspaper obituary column, he turns the ordinary into the extraordinary.Clive Owen is amazing as the strong less-than-sensitive type.  His internet sex dialogues with Jude Law's Dan posing as Anna on the computer are as intense as they are manipulated.  When he sits in the aquarium with Anna and with tremendous embarrassment learns the truth, he admits, ""He certainly can write!""  In the scene with Julia Roberts he bellows ""I'm a caveman.""  It seems to typify the heart of ""Closer,"" investigating these very primal sexual urges we have and how they interweave with the emotional attachments we call ""love.""  Owen was nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this role and won the Golden Globe Award.As Alice, Natalie Portman turns in an amazing performance.  Her character seems somewhat beyond reach, but she works the territory masterfully, exploring each need and nuance as if it were a beautiful discovery.  Portman was nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar and also won the Golden Globe Award.Damien Rice's song ""The Blower's Daughter"" is an interesting DVD extra with that riveting chorus, ""Can't take my eyes off of you.""  It's the perfect love song for this film, part pure love and part compulsive addiction.  Mike Nichols has worked with an excellent cast and polished this dialogue to perfection.  The rhythms build and twist and the lovers attract, repel, trust and betray.  It does not so much build to an inevitable conclusion so much as it feels like we've followed the characters through a very intense period of life.  This is a film that will be watched and discussed for decades.

When I first started watching, I wasn't prepared for this and nearly turned it off because it was a little  hard to follow.All that changed however, and, by the time I had been watching for fifteen minutes, I was completely engrossed.  I did a double take, sat back and relaxed and enjoyed the unfolding of this complicated story directed by Mike Nichols, based on a play by Patrick Marber.  The acting was exceptional too.  And even though the actors were easily recognizable film stars, they each portrayed their characters so well, that I soon only saw them as the people they were portraying.The story is set in London, where, in an early scene Natalie Portman and Jude Law fall in love.  She's a young American with dyed purple hair; he's a Brit who writes obituaries for a newspaper.  Later, he writes a book and has his photo taken by Anna, a professional photographer, played by Julia Roberts.  He's wildly attracted to her but she rejects him.  He's angry and decides to play a practical joke.  This involves the internet and a chatroom in which he writes explicit romantic notes to Clive Owens and pretends to be Anna.  This causes Anna and Clive Owens to meet and they soon become lovers.This just the beginning through, and the rest of the story plays out in increasingly complex and interesting ways.  These four people deceive each other, lie, tell piercingly brutal truths and suffer complex emotional pain.  There are constant surprises and turns and twists.  Each character took turns at being the one I hated.  And then things change and I was forced to re-think the scene I just saw as the film becomes faster paced as it moves along.

In desperate measures he tracks down Alice in attempt to regain her trust and love, but his luck fails when he realizes he went to far - leaving him alone in the world with no-one to love him.Overall this movie is a great romantic/dramatic movie that analyzes love, romance, drama, and adultry with incredible accuracy and is an ""all out"" movie, that truly makes you feel for each character, no matter how much you might hate what they have done.",5,The Most Entertaining Romance Of The Year,1112400000,"04 2, 2005",2005,1264,"['movie', 'truly', 'amazing', 'stunning', 'raw', 'risque', 'provoctive', 'overall', 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'watch.This', 'movie', 'love', 'four', 'strangers', 'start', 'grow', 'closer', 'other', 'expierence', 'have', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'star', 'dramatic/romantic', 'movie', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Dan', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Larry', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Anna', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Alice', 'Dan', 'Alice', 'start', 'off', 'romantic', 'duo', 'only', 'come', 'end', 'when', 'Dan', 'romance', 'Anna', 'photographer', 'Alice', 'aware', 'Dan', 'only', 'encounter', 'Larry', 'However', 'time', 'progesses', 'Anna', 'Dan', 'accident', 'meets', 'up', 'Larry', 'only', 'break', 'Dan', 'heart', 'causing', 'realize', 'mistake', 'letting', 'go', 'Alice', 'desperate', 'measures', 'down', 'Alice', 'attempt', 'regain', 'trust', 'love', 'luck', 'when', 'went', 'far', 'leaving', 'alone', 'world', 'no-one', 'love', 'movie', 'great', 'romantic/dramatic', 'movie', 'love', 'romance', 'drama', 'adultry', 'incredible', 'accuracy', 'out', 'movie', 'truly', 'feel', 'character', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'might', 'hate', 'what', 'have', 'done']",N/A

For me, it means that small moments of the film keep reappearing in my consciousness, unsettling me from time to time.  That return to the moment or moments caused me to give this sweeping character study by famed and beloved director Mike Nichols, 4 stars.""Closer"" is a curious film, excellent in its execution, and yet, for those who go to films to be entertained, ""Closer"" will be a dismal failure. Look at it as a character study, a train wreck of every bad relationship you've ever had.  It is not at all entertaining; in fact, it is brutal and artificial in its conception, in its deception.  You are deceived into thinking it will eventually become a love story, but instead it is a story of emotional wounding.Four characters become entwined in relationships based on sex, which they perceive to be love.  The meeting of Dan (Jude Law), angular and sinewy, an obituary writer with a chilly outlook on life (and a lack of integrity that is so much on the surface, you wonder what it is the women see in him) and the luminous, voluptuous, Alice (Natalie Portman) is quite by accident in a London street.  She's running from a life in New York that wasn't turning out the way she planned, and it feels as though she will meet and take up with someone, anyone, on the street.  Dan is a good choice for her emptiness.  We see him next in Anna's (Julia Roberts) photography studio - now a semi-successful author who is posing for a book cover, and who has partnered with Alice for a couple of years, he is immediately arrested by Anna's behavior and looks and wants her desperately.  Alice arrives and Anna is taken with her looks and sexuality, photographing her in a beautiful shot that survives and lives to be a centerpiece in a future show of Anna's work.  Meeting Alice cements in Anna's mind that, as much as she is drawn to Dan, she does not want to be with him.As Anna rebuffs Dan, his smarmy response is to set her up for a meeting (unknown to her) with a wanton doctor that he meets online in a sex chat room.  The doctor, Larry (Clive Owens) is sexual in a primal, raw and needy way.  His encounter with Anna turns from the embarrassing to the sublime when he is able to cut through her reserve and anger with his amazing looks and rough charm.  Your initial reaction to Larry is that Anna is lucky to meet him.  His honesty, decency, and, despite his amazing looks and profession, his lack of polish are disarming.  The four have their first (and only) mutual encounter at Anna's photography show, and it is during this show that the filmgoer begins to become perplexed by the relationships.  Alice and Larry have an encounter that simmers in its desperation, Dan is undone at the outcome of his prank and it becomes apparent that Dan has never ceased pursuing Anna.  More surprises and misdeeds wait after Anna and Larry have been married, in an attempt at decency, only to have her withdraw in a baffling move, in favor of Dan.  The complex feelings of abandonment and anger; the raw emotion that opens when one half of a couple admits to cheating, is repeated in the encounters between Larry and Anna and Dan and Alice.Stunningly, the four are not finished with each other as the divorce proceeds and Larry encounters both Alice, who has returned to her career as a stripper, and then Anna in a scene that will leave you wondering what in the world could Anna's motivation be, and just what will ever make her happy.  There is no decency, no loyalty in the behavior of any of the characters, except for Alice, who retains her amazement and loyalty to her coupling with Dan, until she realizes just how self-absorbed he is and just how much of a game it all is to him, and finally, finally, breaks free; the only one of the three, you believe, that will ever be free of the deceit.It is easy to dislike and distrust Law, and eventually to cheer for his comeuppance.  Although I did not think his performance as strong as that of the others, the very nature of how much you DO dislike him, despite both ladies' love for him, is telling in how much he inhabited his character.  Roberts is credible as Anna, although her screen persona is far too warm to play the cold and confused photographer, who plays out her inner turmoil in her black and white portraits, which are stark, indeed.She is accurate in displaying her moods on her face, accomplished in her dialogue and there is no doubt about why both men would want her, but somehow, she is unable to pull the whole thing off.  Or perhaps she and Law just pale by comparison to the truly excellent performances given by Owen and Portman.Owen, who has been truly decent and sexy as Larry, is a revelation when he is spurned; his behavior varies widely from sorrow, longing and desperation to anger and coldly calculated emotional brutality.  This role, like much of what  Owen has played in the past (a fierce and rugged ""King Arthur"" in Fuqua's film of the same name, an intense and passionate turn as a doctor in Angela Jolie's ""Beyond Borders,"" in a revelatory role in ""Bent"" as a Nazi prisoner who is also a prisoner of his own homosexuality, and, best of all, his enigmatic and cold cynic ""Croupier"" role) is a tribute to his ability to immerse himself in the character, and then draw the audience in with him.  It is high time that the powers that be in Hollywood discovered him not only for his amazing screen presence and beauty, but his skill as an actor.  After ""Closer"", hopefully they will recognize leading man material and he will find a film that will propel him into the upper echelons of today's leading men, where he belongs.  He's had a long career of mostly ""B"" grade films, where his performance is the saving grace of the entire movie.As good as Owen is, he's eclipsed by the breathtaking turn of Natalie Portman as the character who disguises herself as ""Alice"".  She's tantalizingly sexual and a cipher between the wanton and the vulnerable in meeting Dan, meeting Larry, and in the strip club.  In private scenes with Dan, as part of a couple, she's engaging and almost childish in her love for him.  I've long thought of Portman as the young woman of the beautiful face, and thought she was amazing in ""Garden State"", but here she truly steps out of the ""goody good"" roles she's been taking in the past, and gives us a taste of what Natalie Portman, on the brink of adulthood, can be.  She alternately portrays innocence and the knowingness of a woman who knows she inspires lust at first glance.  Her scenes as a stripper are a revelation of beauty and body, and she's ""large and in charge"" of the encounter with Larry; that's when you know that, despite the hurt, despite her willingness to run from port to port in a storm, she's ultimately a survivor.  Portman was surprisingly cast, and Nichols' instincts and ability to direct such an amazing performance leave her, too, on the brink of a career explosion, if she chooses roles correctly.Unlike many of the critics, I did feel the chemistry between the characters; complete and utter longing and abandonment, not love.  By film's end, you are convinced that all of them are soulless.  I did not, however, feel or engage in the worth of any one character; was not rooting for them, was not drawn in by them, at least until the closing scene in New York, in which a very different Portman takes a walk as ""Alice"", now liberated from the need to hide or costume her appearance.  In this final walk, I was touched by how happy I was that she'd escaped the madness, and how much I wanted her to be happy.Nichols was fortunate to escape with an ""R"" rating for Closer as presented.  Should he have been given an ""NC-17"" he would have been forced to edit some of Owens's language and some of the scenes, notably from the strip club.  Although this film is not for children or teenagers, it is filmed in an honest and frank fashion, much of what Nichols is known for.  The frank sexuality is necessary to understand and to frame the characters' motivation.  The DVD version of this film, at least the only one that has been released at this time, uses Superbit technology, so the filming is beautifully portrayed, but none of the extras that would normally come with a DVD are present (and perhaps this was due to the rush to release it before the Academy Awards).  The film is shown in English and French, but there are no outtakes, no interviews with the players to understand how they got motivated into their characters (and this would have been fascinating, especially in the case of Portman), no Nichols interview, nothing to redeem the price of the DVD.One more amazing thing about the film, however, is the theme song ""The Blower's Daughter"" (the video is contained on the DVD) by Irish troubadour Damien Rice.  It is powerful and haunting, perhaps the best movie theme of the past several years.And thus, my recommendation is to rent, not buy, and only if you are looking for insight into filmmaking, or transformation of a play to a film, not if you would like to be entertained.",4,"""Closer"" makes you relive every bad moment you've ever had",1114905600,"05 1, 2005",2005,9101,"['relationship',

884488,AZTDHDUTVOSCC,B0007OCG4W,"mallard ""calvin""","[12, 14]","Have you ever seen a human heart?"" asks a character in ""Closer,"" the new film by Mike Nichols. ""It looks like a fist wrapped in blood.""That's a pretty good description for ""Closer,"" too, except it doesn't look like a fist wrapped in blood, it feels like one -- and it's reaching out to pummel you with the raw ""truth"" about men and women, love and sex.Prepare yourself. This is one of those movies that critics invariably describe as ""brutally honest,"" one of those movies that is determined to peel back the mask of Hollywood's romantic lies and show that deep down, people are cruel, love is a sham, and the world is a cold, hard place. Oh, yeah: And the only honest women in this world are strippers and whores. Don't forget that one.Nichols has explored this grim territory before, in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" in 1966 and ""Carnal Knowledge"" in 1971. But if the message was just as unpleasant back then, the timing at least made some sense: The women's movement and the sexual revolution had thrown the old ideas of love and sex into a shredder, and Nichols was hardly the only artist trying to make sense of the shards that were left.But if those movies were of their time, ""Closer,"" adapted from the hit play by British playwright Patrick Marber, feels like it exists in a vacuum. Why do the characters lie and cheat and hurt the very people they say they love?Marber is too focused on getting at the cruel ""truth"" to be distracted by such trivial concerns as motivation. He gives his characters lots of smart, brittle dialogue, but he doesn't give them souls, or history, or anything else that would make them more than caricatured types.Without such specificity -- and in art, the specific is what leads us to the universal -- we're left with a pretty feeble answer to all that lying and hurt: It's simply human nature.Marber also wants us to believe that true intimacy is impossible, especially in this modern world of sex, lies and computer hard drives. He hammers his point home with relentless references to strangers. The movie's first line, ""Hello, stranger,"" is just the beginning. A photography show that is the setting of a crucial scene is called -- way too symbolically -- ""Strangers,"" and when a character asks the photographer, ""Am I a stranger?"" her cutting answer is, ""You're a job.""The format is basically a sexual roundelay among four strangers. In London, a writer, Dan (Jude Law), meets and falls for an American girl, Alice (Natalie Portman), when she's hit by a cab. She used to be a stripper, and Dan writes a novel based on her life. When he goes to have his book-jacket photo taken, he falls for the photographer, Anna (Julia Roberts).Anna spurns him -- she won't let him betray Alice -- and a year or so later he plays a mean practical joke on her. He sets her up, anonymously through a cyber-sex Web site, with a doctor, Larry (Clive Owen).Anna and Larry hit it off at that rendezvous and get married, and when Dan finds out, he dumps Alice and tries to take Anna away from Larry. Larry responds like an animal whose fresh prey has been stolen.Each scene takes place at either the beginning or the end of the affair in question. It's a stagy gimmick -- almost as arch and mannered as the theatrical dialogue -- and it works against the film. By cutting out the middle and focusing only on the shallow flirtations of the beginnings and the betrayals of the ends, Marber further alienates us from the characters, who remain distant and unlikable.The smashing cast certainly tries to bring these thin characters to life, and it's to their credit that the movie is as sleek and nastily entertaining as it is, despite the material.Roberts works hard against her natural vivacity to play a depressed, guilt-ridden woman torn between two men. She's credible in the role, but it feels like Nichols drained her life-force away, and after an hour of watching her look haunted and hollow you think, ""What exactly is the point of making Julia Roberts a depressive?"" It's like making Audrey Hepburn drab.Law also is stripped of his charm. Dan is written as a weak conniver who will lie to get anything, and the role reduces him to jealous sniveling and begging.Portman fares a lot better in a role for which she's perfectly suited.

All four leads turn in pretty mediocre performances, though this could be due to the weak script - one of those overblown ones that look fabulous on paper and jaw-droppingly awful when spoken by actors - and Julia Roberts' perplexing drag-queen like performance does nothing to elevate the quality of this cinema.Depsite Natalie Portmans' desperate attempts at some sort of nouveau-style attempt at dramatics (her breakdown scene when Jude Law leaves her is particularly embarrassing), the film wears thin in about a half hour. This is because you know exactly what happens, and you know that these four characters are going to be kicked around so hard that by the end of the film you feel sympathy for none of them. And thats exactly what happened.""Closer"" is the story of two couples whose lives intertwine. Most of this has got to do with sexual attraction - romance and love take a back seat, and this was an aspect of the film that did not appeal to me. Its as if the director really wanted to show us a dark, depressing side of relationships, but at the same time wanted to infuse the film with the air of an 'artiste', so in the end you have a very snobbish film with no substance or artistic merit whatsoever. If people behaved like people in this film do, we'd all be rather stunned, simply because none of the characters carry themselves with the remote consistency of a human being. The play is robotic even, and if that was the intended effect, even that wasn't done very well.I particularly have a problem with Jude Laws' character in the film because the actor has really compromised both on his acting and choice of roles on this one. Forget the tawdry net-lingo used in the movie, its difficult to imagine someone being so spineless and fearless at the same time. Even if they were, Jude Law doesn't do a very good job of convincing us. Julia Roberts looks frighteningly like a man in this movie, seeming so much older than all of her costars, including Clive Owen who is no spring chicken to begin with. Not that this is a bad thing, but it really removes her from the spirit of the film. Natalie Portman is far more effective, but the horrendous dialogue they give her ruins any chance she has.The DVD of ""Closer"" is a welcome addition because I believe every film student should see this movie. Its quirky and will be talked about, but to me thats for all the wrong reasons. Unlike real modern classics like 'The Machinist' this movie wants to be a cutting edge dark film so desperately, that it shows. And when that happens, it can't do much else than fall to pieces. This is very poor film-making, and I wish the acclaimed director would go back to making films the way he used to instead of using overpaid Hollywood stars in meaningless films about relationships based on lust and deceit.An ineffective film.

884493,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B0007OCG4W,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[6, 7]","Closer is an intimate look at two very complicated and very troubled relationships. A reviewer for TIME Magazine has called Closer ""A love story for adults,"" but this is a far cry from any love story you are likely to see. If this is love, take back my reservation.Patrick Marber adapted his own play about two couples who try, unsuccessfully, to secretly swap partners. The film gets up close and personal with these four people with scenes that are so real and packed with so much emotion, you want to look away because they seem so private, yet you can't take your eyes off the screen.The cast is mesmerizing, each perfect in their roles. Julia Roberts is quite impressive as Anna, in one of her best performances. She is always easier to take when her trademark acting ticks are stripped away and she does a good job conveying a woman wracked with guilt who is nonetheless compelled to cause hurt. Jude Law is quite good as Dan, an obituary writer struggling to become a novelist, and Clive Owen is terrific in an Oscar nominated and Golden Globe winning role as Larry, a dermatologist who meets Anna because of a cruel joke by Dan. Natalie Portman, especially, delivers a nuanced and unforgettable performance in her Oscar nominated and Golden Globe winning performance. She was most stunning of all in her first 'adult' role. I look forward to seeing more of her once the horrendous first three Star Wars films come to an end in May.What makes Closer so interesting, aside from the across-the-board blistering performances and crackling dialogue, is that you might empathize with a character in one scene, and then hate their guts in the next. Everyone is a victim, and everyone is an abuser, although not always in the most obvious ways. Closer is very adult, and very clever; a classy, striking piece of work.Veteran director Mike Nichols' juggles the various time frames with consummate artistry and his subtle dramatic skill evokes memories of his first film, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" (1966) - but there's no Elizabeth Taylor or Richard Burton here, although all four actors deliver unusually strong performances.

Because of her limited ability, hers is the character we get to know the least and feel the least for - but thats exactly the point, her character is an empty shell. Anyone who has been through the situations depicted here (havent we all???) will find this film refreshingly real and touching. Closer is not Hollywood, its not meant to entertain or thrill, its a slice of life only. But as such, it is brilliant and revealing.

Dan (Jude Law), an aspiring novelist, cannot help but feeling immensely attracted to Alice (Natalie Portman), a young American waitress and stripper who is in London escaping from a failed relationship. But nothing last forever, and after some time he meets Anna (Julia Roberts), a photographer, and feels attracted to her. The film's subtitle says it all: ""If you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking"".Nothing happens right away, but from then onwards, things go downhill for Alice and Dan. Yes, they don't break up, but Dan is already mentally involved in another relationship, even if he is too coward to leave Alice, and although he knows that Anna won't go out with him. Dan is so obsessed with Anna that he even impersonates her in a sex-chat, unintentionally paving the way for the meeting of Anna with her future husband, Larry (Clive Owen).Eventually Dan, Alice, Anna and Larry take part in a twisted dance of deceit, guilt and anger. Betrayal, lack of trust, and relationships gone sour are the themes of ""Closer"". This isn't  a movie about love, but rather one about attraction, lust and lies.What is the truth?. What is love?. Can we just decide not to be in love?. As you see this movie, you will ask yourself those questions and quite a few more. The characters are not specially lovable, but they are somehow fascinating, in the way snakes sometimes are. All the same, their acting is really superb. Natalie Portman, in particular, was outstanding as Alice. Innocent yet seductive, vulnerable and worldweary, Portman delivers some of the more striking lines in the film, for instance when Alice says to Larry that ""lying is the most fun a girl can have while keeping her clothes on"".Mike Nichols did a wonderful job directing a movie out of Patrick Marber's play. However, you should be warned that he uses explicit language in order to shock the spectator, and achieves his aim quite well. Also, at times the emotions displayed by the characters are so strong that you will be too close for comfort.This is a film about the kind of relationship you hope you will never have, one based on lies. It is also a movie where truth isn't specially important: it is merely a excuse so characters will have (and do) what they want. If you don't mind the subject and the language, you will enjoy this movie, because it has good actors, and it provides you the opportunity of knowing exactly what NOT to do in a relationship.Belen Alcat",4,"If you believe in love at first sight,you never stop looking",1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,2524,"['Closer', 'quite', 'traditionally', 'two', 'strangers', 'fall', 'love', 'Dan', 'Jude', 'Law', 'aspiring', 'novelist', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feeling', 'immensely', 'attracted', 'Alice', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'young', 'American', 'waitress', 'stripper', 'who', 'London', 'escaping', 'failed', 'relationship', 'nothing', 'last', 'forever', 'time', 'Anna', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'photographer', 'feels', 'attracted', 'film', 'subtitle', 'believe', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'never', 'stop', 'looking', '.Nothing', 'happens', 'right', 'away', 'then', 'onwards', 'things', 'go', 'downhill', 'Alice', 'Dan', 'Yes', 'do', ""n't"", 'break', 'up', 'Dan', 'already', 'mentally', 'involved', 'relationship', 'even', 'too', 'coward', 'leave', 'Alice', 'Anna', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'Dan', 'so', 'obsessed', 'Anna', 'even', 'sex-chat', 'unintentionally', 'paving', 'way', 'meeting', 'Anna', 'future', 'husband', 'Larry', 'Clive', 'Owen', '.Eventually', 'Dan', 'Alice', 'Anna', 'Larry', 'take', 'part', 'twisted', 'dance', 'deceit', 'guilt', 'anger', 'Betrayal', 'lack', 'trust', 'gone', 'sour', 'are', 'themes', 'Closer', ""n't"", 'movie', 'love', 'rather', 'one', 'attraction', 'lust', 'truth', 'What', 'love', 'Can', 'just', 'decide', 'not', 'be', 'love', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'ask', 'questions', 'quite', 'few', 'more', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'specially', 'lovable', 'are', 'somehow', 'fascinating', 'way', 'snakes', 'sometimes', 'are', 'same', 'acting', 'really', 'superb', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'particular', 'was', 'outstanding', 'Alice', 'Innocent', 'yet', 'seductive', 'vulnerable', 'worldweary', 'Portman', 'more', 'striking', 'lines', 'film', 'instance', 'when', 'Alice', 'Larry', 'lying', 'most', 'fun', 'girl', 'can', 'have', 'keeping', 'clothes', '.Mike', 'Nichols', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'directing', 'movie', 'Patrick', 'Marber', 'play', 'However', 'should', 'be', 'warned', 'explicit', 'language', 'order', 'shock', 'spectator', 'aim', 'quite', 'well', 'Also', 'times', 'emotions', 'displayed', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'strong', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'close', 'comfort.This', 'film', 'kind', 'relationship', 'hope', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'one', 'based', 'lies', 'also', 'movie', 'where', 'truth', ""n't"", 'specially', 'important', 'merely', 'excuse', 'characters', 'will', 'have', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'subject', 'language', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'good', 'actors', 'opportunity', 'knowing', 'exactly', 'what', 'NOT', 'do', 'relationship.Belen', 'Alcat']",N/A

It is about deception in all its various permutations: lying, cheating, pretending to love someone, pretending not to love someone.""Closer"" is about anything other then actually being close. In fact ""Closer"" is about staying as far away emotionally from people as you can: playing games with each other, taunting each other with frank descriptions of intimate encounters and instigating brutal arguments in which the need to hurt and cut as deeply as possible is paramount.The four involved are: Alice (Natalie Portman), Dan (Jude Law), Anna (Julia Roberts) and Larry (Clive Owen)Adapted from Patrick Marber's play of the same name, ""Closer"" several times retains the artificiality of a stage play. Movies are naturalistic, the Stage is artificial and at times the screenplay and Mike Nichols direction leads the actors down the wrong path artistically: for example Julia Roberts, the warmest of screen actresses actually comes off arch and stilted saying some of her lines.But about midway through, things even out and Marber and Nichols get down to telling their story in movie terms. It's interesting to note that many scenes here remind me of Nichols's first film, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" in their eagerness to go for the throat.One outstanding scene between Anna and Larry has them going at each other like wounded, feral animals. I can't think of another recent film scene that packs such an emotional wallop. One that makes you wince because, by this point you know the characters well, they use words to slice each other up like surgeons performing heart surgery.Law and Roberts play difficult characters to like much less love, which is probably what appealed to both of these actors on paper. But Anna and Dan are both emotional wrecks stuck out in a sea of diffidence and indecision and everyone around them is equally coflicted and emotionally closed. But, beautiful failures though they made be, Anna and Dan are nonetheless at the epicenter of this foursome. At times, Law and Roberts are effective and at others not so much.Clive Owen is the real revelation here as Larry: a Dermatologist addicted to Computer Chat Rooms, from more earthy, humble beginnings than Anna and Dan...but very proud of his accomplishments. Owen plays him rough but sincere and when he tells Anna that he doesn't lie...you believe him.Natalie Portman comes off best I think as 24-year-old Alice, who meets Dan in a classic ""cute meet"" manner: she is hit by a car and he helps her to the hospital. Portman, who has played Anne Frank on the stage and has less movie time than any of the other principals, plays Alice as if it is the last role she will ever play: she's direct, she's touching, she's sexy.There is definitely something chilling and icy about the world that Nichols and Marber create in ""Closer.""

Kennedy ""insane book lover""","[3, 8]","CLOSER is not a great movie and I'm not sure it makes you think about Life in ways that make up for its lack of greatness. But it is quite a watchable movie, if only for the brilliant star power of its four main and only characters: Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Julie Roberts and Clive Owen. Owen, being the least well-known of the four, nevertheless manages to deliver the strongest performance, or has the best lines, in Mike Nichols' adaptation of Patrick Marber's play. But my favorite is Natalie Portman as Alice. She is beautiful and  sensational in this film, representing  - if I may speculate - Innocent Love. Her character is there to show how we can tragically screw up Innocent or True Love. And who hasn't? The other three characters in the story are busy hurting each other and essentially form a love triangle with Anna (Roberts) as the confused, sought-after prize. While Alice is the most innocent of the four she delivers the hardest and most honest blow at the end. She is really the only character to admire of the lot. I have been a devoted fan of Natalie Portman ever since BEAUTIFUL GIRLS and she doesn't disappont in  CLOSER. Basically a downer film, CLOSER nevertheless has some fine performances and the script is sound. The problem is that one is left questioning why four near-middle-aged, attractive, successful people willingly engage in such screwed-up, hurtful, juvenile relationships. One wonders if such a script got made into a movie due to Hollywood Myopia. That would explain in general why box office receipts have been falling off: Hollywood produces way too many movies like CLOSER which seemed targeted for a certain group of intellectual elite who think it chic to get depressed while being entertained; yet these kind of movies are artistically representative of the lives of only a fraction of ticket-buyers and are likely based on the writer's dysfunctional friends and relatives. Most of us in America, thank you, are basically happy types and don't want to be confronted with depressing subject matter when we go to the movies for a good time.",4,NATALIE RULES!,1122076800,"07 23, 2005",2005,2088,"['CLOSER', 'not', 'great', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'think', 'Life', 'ways', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'greatness', 'quite', 'watchable', 'movie', 'only', 'brilliant', 'star', 'power', 'four', 'main', 'only', 'characters', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Julie', 'Roberts', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Owen', 'being', 'least', 'well-known', 'four', 'nevertheless', 'deliver', 'strongest', 'performance', 'best', 'lines', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'adaptation', 'Patrick', 'Marber', 'play', 'favorite', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Alice', 'beautiful', 'sensational', 'film', 'representing', 'may', 'speculate', 'Innocent', 'Love', 'character', 'there', 'show', 'how', 'can', 'tragically', 'screw', 'up', 'Innocent', 'True', 'Love', 'who', ""n't"", 'other', 'three', 'characters', 'story', 'are', 'busy', 'hurting', 'other', 'essentially', 'form', 'love', 'triangle', 'Anna', 'Roberts', 'confused', 'sought-after', 'prize', 'Alice', 'most', 'innocent', 'four', 'hardest', 'most', 'honest', 'blow', 'end', 'really', 'only', 'character', 'admire', 'lot', 'have', 'been', 'devoted', 'fan', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'ever', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'GIRLS', ""n't"", 'disappont', 'CLOSER', 'Basically', 'downer', 'film', 'CLOSER', 'nevertheless', 'fine', 'performances', 'script', 'sound', 'problem', 'one', 'left', 'questioning', 'why', 'four', 'near-middle-aged', 'attractive', 'successful', 'people', 'willingly', 'engage', 'such', 'screwed-up', 'hurtful', 'juvenile', 'relationships', 'One', 'such', 'script', 'got', 'made', 'movie', 'due', 'Hollywood', 'Myopia', 'would', 'explain', 'general', 'why', 'box', 'office', 'receipts', 'have', 'been', 'falling', 'off', 'Hollywood', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'CLOSER', 'seemed', 'targeted', 'certain', 'group', 'intellectual', 'elite', 'who', 'think', 'get', 'depressed', 'being', 'entertained', 'yet', 'kind', 'movies', 'are', 'artistically', 'representative', 'lives', 'only', 'fraction', 'ticket-buyers', 'are', 'likely', 'based', 'writer', 'dysfunctional', 'friends', 'relatives', 'Most', 'America', 'thank', 'are', 'basically', 'happy', 'types', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'confronted', 'depressing', 'subject', 'matter', 'when', 'go', 'movies', 'good', 'time']",N/A
884507,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0007OCG4W,mirasreviews,"[7, 16]","Out of several hundred movies that I've reviewed, I can count the unadulterated duds on one hand. ""Closer"" is the latest addition to this select group of utter cinematic failures. It's based on a Broadway play written by Patrick Marber, who also wrote the screenplay. And the writing is atrocious. This is a ""relationship movie"". It's about two couples: Alice and Dan, Anna and Larry. Alice (Natalie Portman) is a young American in London. She and Dan (Jude Law) meet when Alice looks the wrong way when crossing a street and is hit by a car. After he has been with Alice for a year, Dan meets Anna (Julia Roberts), a portrait photographer who is also American. Anna rejects him. So Dan poses as Anna on an internet sex chat site and sets Anna up with Larry (Clive Owen), a sleazebag doctor, without her knowing it. But Anna and Larry hit it off and become a couple. A year later, Dan is still with Alice but preoccupied with Anna. So change your partners, dosey-doe. But that's not the end of it. Unfortunately.The first thing that I noticed about ""Closer"" is that it's contrived to the point of being corny. The second thing I noticed is that I didn't know anyone's name. The characters have protracted conversations with strangers without introducing themselves. We get the first name 10 minutes into the film. By this point, it's a relief. I presume ""Closer"" is supposed to be about how and why people love one another, but it is a hypothetical exploration of that subject. Real people don't act or speak like these characters, and there is no indication of why the characters care for one another. In fact, they really don't seem to. The idea that any of the characters are in love is preposterous.The dialogue is stilted and ridiculous. It feels like a play. A bad play. Characters constantly make nonsensical proclamations, like ""I couldn't lie to you....because I love you."" Every conversation is ponderous. The writing is so bad that sometimes one character has to articulate what another is feeling. Larry is a thoroughly obnoxious person who lives for conquest. Dan is a romantic. Both men are uncommonly self-absorbed. Anna is guilt-ridden. Alice is supposed to be an enigma, but she's just childlike. Anna and Larry both seem emotionally ill, so I have to agree with Larry that they belong together. All four of them have a pathological desire to know everything about their partners, which they spend most of their time pursuing. At one point Dan says, ""Please tell me the truth....because I'm addicted to it."" Yup. Their lives would be a lot easier if these people discovered the concept of discretion.I can't say ""Closer"" is all bad. It really depends upon your sense of humor. The dialogue is unintentionally funny from the start. If you last long enough, there is one interminable conversation between Larry and Alice in a strip club that is absolutely hilarious. You'll laugh out loud when Dan breaks down in tears. That's notable for being the nadir of Jude Law's career. Truthfully, Clive Owen's performance is good, but his character is nonsense. The other three performances are flat. They could scarcely be otherwise. So I don't recommend the film. But if you approach ""Closer"" with wry humor and lots of popcorn, you might find something in it.The DVD (Columbia/Tristar 2005 release): There is a music video for ""The Blower's Daughter"", performed by Damien Rice, which is the song that plays over the closing credits.

884508,APN6DO7VHDLTN,B0007OCG4W,Missing Person,"[2, 4]","2004's ""Closer"" was directed by Mike Nichols, and it has a lot in common with his legendary 1971 film ""Carnal Knowledge"" (which stars Jack Nicholson).  Unfortunately, ""Closer"" isn't as profound as that earlier film.Frankly, ""Closer"", although an interesting movie, is frustratingly hollow.  It has kind of a go-nowhere plot, with characters demonstrating baffling, erractic behavior for reasons that make basically no rational sense.  That said, each of the four main characters here are desperate, as well as emotional wrecks.  There are indeed a number of gripping scenes, with particular thanks to Clive Owen for his excellent portrayal of the sexually-obsessed and morally bankrupt dermatologist Larry.  Jude Law is also solid as the charming-on-the-surface but self-loathing obituary writer Dan.The weak link in the chain, as far as the acting is concerned, is Natalie Portman.  She delivers an annoying, unconvincing, forgettable performance as a stripper supposedly named Alice Ayers.  The fact that she was nominated for an Academy Award doesn't speak highly of either the Academy or the current state of high profile movies.The movie loses additional points for its prominent use of the absolutely horrible, pompous, pretentious, and predictable Damien Rice song ""The Blower's Daughter"".  This song is featured basically in its entirety at the very beginning of the movie, a terrible way to start things off.

Most of the film is just four characters talking to each other throughout the 1 hour and 40 minute running time. I thought this kind of film would bore me to tears, but thankfully most of the dialogue was clever and the acting really made this film shine. Jude Law and Julia Roberts were pretty good, but innocent looking Natalie Portman was great in her first mature performance. Clive Owen is what made this movie for me. He is probably best know for his recent film ""King Arthur"" and will be seen in ""Sin City"" coming out this Friday.

This film takes place over a period time.  It is not apparent from a first watch but you will notice this on a second look.  The screenplay was adapted from Patrick Marber's hit West End Play (I saw it in Los Angeles at the Mark Taper Forum.)Dan Wolf (Jude Law) is a wannabe writer who is currently writing obits.  One day he is walking down the street when American Alice Ayers (Natalie Portman) crosses the street and is hit by a taxi.  Dan rushes Anna to the hospital and this starts their relationship.Passage of time, Dan and Alice are now married.  Dan has written a book based on Alice.  He is sent to have his cover picture taken by Anna Cameron (Julia Roberts).  He has an instant connection with her but she resists because he is married.Passage of time, Dan is surfing in a chat room and pretends to be a woman.  He is chatting up Dr. Larry Bagley (Clive Owen) who is bored at work.  In the end, Larry asks to meet up.  Off the top of his head, Dan agrees to meet Larry at the Aquarium and tells him his name is Anna.Next day at the Aquarium, Larry finds Anna (she mentioned to Dan that the Aquarium is her favorite place to go and meditate.)  But of course, she has no idea what is going on.  That is until Larry tells her about the chat room.  Anna puts two and two together.  But she likes Larry, so no harm.Passage of time, Anna is having her first showing of her photographs at a gallery.  She has married Larry.  Dan and Alice show up.  While Dan is chatting up Anna, Larry is with Alice.Passage of time, Larry has returned from a medical convention to find Anna out of sorts.  It turns out that Dan and Anna have been having an affair ever since the showing.  Simultaneously, Alice finds out about the affair and leaves Dan.Passage of time, Larry has given into his baser desires and is now frequenting strip clubs and finds Anna performing.  He becomes fixated with her and tries to get her to go home with him but she is still in love with Dan. (This is Natalie's best scene.)Passage of time, Dan and Anna are on the outs and Dan confronts Larry.  Larry baits Dan and he leaves in a rage.  In the end, Anna returns to Larry but Dan is not so lucky.The final scene has Dan back at a park by the hospital where he took Anna and finds out one of her secrets.Mike Nichols is the one of the great directors who has not had a hit in years.  This definitely broke his dry spell.  This film had a definite edge but with a lesser director it would be tawdry, with Nichols it was perfection.Clive Owen received a long overdue Oscar nomination and should have won (but it was great to see Morgan Freeman finally get his recognition.)  Julia Roberts showed why she is the number one actress working.  Anna is an extremely complex character and she handled every scene with extreme talent.  This was Jude Law's year for roles (he had four films that year) but Dan is not a likeable character so he was greatly overlooked.  Natalie Portman also received an Oscar nomination for her deft work as the quintessential ""other woman"".This is not a film for the prudish or faint of heart.

I popped Closer in because the previews were so sparse that I figured I would watch it and actually see what it was about.  The movie itself isn't half-bad; it's obviously not a rosy, Brady Bunch kind of film, but I guess it's realistic in the sense that (some) people swear, have sex, look at porno sites, strip, etc.  There were parts of this film I thought were funny...mostly Clive Owen's character because he seems to be a strong up-and-coming actor.  (I did really like King Arthur and he was pretty hot in it)My biggest surpise was Natalie Portman.  I thought she brought a lot of truth and vision to the film, especially since it's an extremely dilalogue-driven piece, and she shined.  She showed range, and I honestly found myself saying, ""Natalie Portman was a much more likely Oscar contender than Virginia Madsen (Sideways) was.""  Virginia, I love her, had zero range in her fifteen minutes performance, but that's another review.  I just really couldn't believe what an excellent job Portman did...and Clive Owen is certainly upping the scale in the looks department.  Julia?

Most adults at some moment use and abuse sex for short term needs, lonliness, insecurities, frustrations, boredom, to assert their independence, or even to hurt a third party or to settle a score.  It also shows how the obsessive need to ""spill your guts"" or know ""all the details"" can destroy what might have been a lifetime marriage (the movie argues some old secrets have to be kept out of pity or gratitude)  I did however think the sexual component was way overemphasized though.

884520,A2UM70SXX6TY30,B0007OCG4W,"Ned K. Wynn ""EKW""","[4, 8]","Generally, films about the soullessness of modern life turn out to be soulless themselves. They don't set out to be, but they end up being nonetheless. This is certainly true of Closer. It is a film full of empty genius, cut-flower people living cut-flower lives while pretending that they are really flesh and blood. The fact that they lack souls is understood to be simply the state in which ""all"" society finds itself today. This take on society is often said to be ""unflinching"" or ""brutally honest,"" but I found it tiresome, repetitive, and self-serving. The ""all,"" above, is in quotes because the people who write and make plays and films like Closer see themselves as the whole world. They fail to see they are not, so great is their need for self-validation. Because of this Closer is, at its core, inescapably hollow. No heart beats within it, only words, and these words are used to injure and defeat - in particular - those whom they are meant to love and succor.Another problem with Closer is that it was a play to begin with, and it has been my experience that almost all filmed plays fail to escape the proscenium in some way or another. Usually it is in the snappy, stagy dialogue where people keep saying incredibly deft things to one another in a kind of sing-song rhythm each one topping the other until there is a put-stop that ends that particular thread. It's classic stage writing, and it's ever-present in Closer. If the play itself was really terrific (it won a number of awards), the movie seems to be more an exercise in not messing up the play rather than in making it into a film that might engage us. Too much respect for the play is a part of what makes Closer so off-putting. Never, in this film, did I feel any affection for any of the characters, not for the celestial Natalie Portman nor for Clive Owen, two of my favorite actors. No one rose above the still, dry, raspy worthlessness of the people they portrayed and of the situation in which they had deliberately put themselves.There is no chemistry among any of the actors, either. This is a fatal flaw. It was the same feeling I had while watching a film called ""We Don't Live Here Anymore."" The same four dreadful people seem to have migrated from that film to this one so that they could rip and tear themselves and one another up all over again, only under new names and in new settings. I did not believe for one second any of the many repetitions of ""I love you"" that I heard clattering from the characters' mouths. I've never heard these words spoken so meaninglessly. They seemed to stall in mid-air the instant they were uttered, almost as if they lacked the conviction to extend as far as the other person's ears. I felt as if they were merely being used to force-feed some life and blood into this lifeless, bloodless work. I do not believe that any of the people loved anyone including themselves. That is what I mean by soullessness, and by the empty genius brought to bear on what is, ostensibly, a representation of our eternal, human condition.Closer is clever, literate, and full of airy intelligence; it is a professional and very well-made movie that left me feeling empty, weary, and dissatisfied.

884521,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B0007OCG4W,Nicholas Carroll,"[0, 0]","When I saw this film in theaters I was completely blown away with it.  Before I even went to see it, I was impressed with the perfect casting of four actors whom I really enjoy watching on film:  Julia Roberts (as Anna), Natalie Portman (as Alice), Jude Law (as Dan), and Clive Owen (as Larry).  This one is really dialogue heavy in a way that pulls you in and never lets go.  Among the four actors, I think Natalie Portman pretty much owns this picture and her recent Golden Globe was well deserved (I hope she repeats on Sunday by nabbing the Best Supporting Actress Oscar).  The scenes of her in a private room of a strip club, bending her body in imaginative and seductive ways while still carrying on an intense and sexually charged conversation with Larry is an amazing scene for me.  To watch this film and ""Garden State"", you will be convinced that Natalie Portman is the actress of her generation and will only grow from here.Clive Owen is also great in this film and his character of Larry is the most conniving of the four.  The movie works to a brilliant resolution, in which is wicked knowledge of Anna's psychology is used to set up a rival for his former flame's affections (Dan).  Payback is a b...., as they say and well deserved in the case of pathetic Dan, who toys with people's emotions, pretending to be who he's not, especially in the Internet chatroom.While some people might not find any of the characters sympathetic or like the idea that people in relationships lie to one another, but I find a lot of what happens in this film to be true to life, in my own observations of people.  To live a completely honest life means one is going to be stepped on, taken advantaged of, and discarded when no longer convenient.  This film should serve as a wake up call to anyone that it sometimes takes cunning to win at the game of love.  The pathetic aspect of love is that no one wants to get hurt, yet too many don't see the hurt they cause in others.

884523,A3DYIGOLWS5CNS,B0007OCG4W,Niel Rishoi,"[3, 4]","Thank you, Mike Nichols.  For putting out an adult, absorbing, brutally realistic film about the capriciousness of human nature.  You may not like what you see, you may not even like any of the characters, but for anyone who has been through the agonies, insecurities and uncertainties of relationships, they will recognize many of the myriad facets as such portrayed in this film. Of course this movie was only a mild success; it's too unflinching, too in-your-face for most of the masses to endure. For once, the sexual dynamics in a film make sense; most of the time, sex portrayed in films is really idiotic, because the strain of movie stars schticking their way through such scenarios is obvious, rarely credible, always ponderous. Here, though, people act and talk with a frankness that mirrors reality. The dialogue, explicit, often crude, sometimes bittersweet-funny as it is, seems to have been culled from the minds and mouths of real people.  Nichols isn't afraid to expose the the vulnerabilities and fears that exist in human nature, and it is gratifying that some directors still exist who provide thought-provoking, intensely stimulating movies such as this is.This may be one of Julia Roberts' best performances. For it places her in a new realm, that of an evolving actress capable of rising to complex material and responding superbly well to the situations and to Nichols'compact direction. Her well-known traits are kept under check here, and brings to the surface a far more interesting, multi-faceted persona. She seems more real, more human than ever.Natalie Portman matches Roberts in every way, and she gives the most scary element in the film. You're never sure where she or her character is going to take you, and propagates the kind of fears that will strike terror in vulnerable men.Jude Law also reaches new dimensions. He has a wonderfully expressive face, and he reveals, quite spontaneously, skillfully, the torments his character suffers.Clive Owen gives a real star turn here, and in fact dominates the film. Owen adroitly portrays a man driven by his raging hormones, and better still, disdains to apologize for it. More than any male character I've ever seen portrayed, he is exactly who he is; Larry calls himself a ""caveman"" to Roberts' character, but he also shows that his love for her is genuine. Owen is at his most effective during his big scene with Roberts, when she tells him of her unfaithfulness and she intends to leave.  Owen's face crumpling into heartbroken pain is entirely believable, and cuts through to the viewer; you feel his pain acutely, while reviling him on another level. Owen is not only a brilliant actor, but is devastatingly magnetic and appealing; he is the perfect embodiment of the professionally and sexually driven contemporary man.Nichols and these actors make for a movie that you can't soon forget. It forces people to delve into interpersonal complexities that exist, but which are rarely portrayed.",5,"Mesmerizing, adult drama that seethes with realism",1112140800,"03 30, 2005",2005,2977,"['Thank', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'putting', 'out', 'adult', 'absorbing', 'brutally', 'realistic', 'film', 'capriciousness', 'human', 'nature', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'what', 'see', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'characters', 'anyone', 'who', 'been', 'agonies', 'insecurities', 'uncertainties', 'relationships', 'will', 'recognize', 'many', 'myriad', 'facets', 'such', 'portrayed', 'film', 'course', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'mild', 'success', 'too', 'unflinching', 'too', 'in-your-face', 'most', 'masses', 'endure', 'once', 'sexual', 'dynamics', 'film', 'make', 'sense', 'most', 'time', 'sex', 'portrayed', 'films', 'really', 'idiotic', 'strain', 'movie', 'stars', 'schticking', 'way', 'such', 'scenarios', 'obvious', 'rarely', 'credible', 'always', 'ponderous', 'Here', 'though', 'people', 'act', 'talk', 'frankness', 'reality', 'dialogue', 'explicit', 'often', 'crude', 'sometimes', 'bittersweet-funny', 'have', 'been', 'culled', 'minds', 'mouths', 'real', 'people', 'Nichols', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'expose', 'vulnerabilities', 'fears', 'exist', 'human', 'nature', 'gratifying', 'directors', 'still', 'exist', 'who', 'provide', 'thought-provoking', 'intensely', 'stimulating', 'movies', 'such', 'is.This', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'best', 'performances', 'new', 'realm', 'evolving', 'actress', 'capable', 'rising', 'complex', 'material', 'responding', 'superbly', 'well', 'situations', ""Nichols'compact"", 'direction', 'well-known', 'traits', 'are', 'kept', 'check', 'here', 'surface', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'multi-faceted', 'persona', 'more', 'real', 'more', 'human', 'ever.Natalie', 'Portman', 'matches', 'Roberts', 'way', 'most', 'scary', 'element', 'film', ""'re"", 'never', 'sure', 'where', 'character', 'going', 'take', 'kind', 'fears', 'will', 'strike', 'terror', 'vulnerable', 'men.Jude', 'Law', 'also', 'new', 'dimensions', 'wonderfully', 'expressive', 'face', 'quite', 'spontaneously', 'skillfully', 'torments', 'character', 'suffers.Clive', 'Owen', 'real', 'star', 'turn', 'here', 'fact', 'film', 'Owen', 'adroitly', 'man', 'driven', 'raging', 'hormones', 'better', 'still', 'apologize', 'More', 'male', 'character', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'portrayed', 'exactly', 'who', 'Larry', 'caveman', 'Roberts', 'character', 'also', 'love', 'genuine', 'Owen', 'most', 'effective', 'big', 'scene', 'Roberts', 'when', 'unfaithfulness', 'leave', 'Owen', 'face', 'crumpling', 'heartbroken', 'pain', 'entirely', 'believable', 'cuts', 'viewer', 'feel', 'pain', 'acutely', 'reviling', 'level', 'Owen', 'not', 'only', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'devastatingly', 'magnetic', 'appealing', 'perfect', 'embodiment', 'professionally', 'sexually', 'driven', 'contemporary', 'man.Nichols', 'actors', 'make', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget', 'people', 'delve', 'interpersonal', 'complexities', 'exist', 'are', 'rarely', 'portrayed']",N/A

Roberts and Law were very good as well, although their parts were not as likeable (on purpose, they were the ""bad guys"") or intricate as the other two. This is another classic example of how a good supporting cast can make a film, and one of the first films I have seen where it seems that the supporting characters were more important than the leading ones. Anyway, the storyline is simple: tragedy in love, but the ending does provide some absolution, for the likeable characters at least. But it is the acting that will be remembered, the heartbreak in Portman's face, and Julia's sad eyes always begging for an answer or a way out.

884531,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B0007OCG4W,Only-A-Child,"[10, 11]","""Closer"" is a film about four people and the role that truth (or different kinds of truth) plays in their relationships as they try to get closer to themselves and to each other. The mixed reaction from viewers is because while ""Closer"" is a nicely packaged film and a fast-paced intelligent screenplay; the four main characters are ""extremes"" or at least extreme examples of the behaviors at the allegorical core of the film. These ""expressionistically"" drawn characters offend and disappoint the viewer segment expecting realistic and sympathetic portrayals (insert ""characters with whom they can identify"" here).But they are extreme because they are intended to illustrate (in obvious ways) certain subtle elements of our romantic relationships. The two male characters, Dan (Jude Law) and Larry (Clive Owen), are products of and participants in the most fundamental Darwinian courtship process. Despite making a pretense of having evolved from the competitive courtship of male primates, they are still driven more by the need to win and secure a trophy than by a quest to love. Likewise Anna, the older female (Julia Roberts), is attracted by the male demonstrations of dominance, both the physical bluster of strength and the mental head games intended to manipulate her emotions. Accordingly her behavior encourages these demonstrations by the males.Contrasted with these three is the younger female (Natalie Portman) who seeks a man who can transcend primitive drives, loving her and allowing her to love him.Into this mix writer Patrick Marber inserts the truth factor in an ironic way. Portman's character places little value on words, adopting a false name at the beginning of the film. That she is superficially living a lie is ironic because she is the only one of the four who does not lie about their true feelings or engage in self-deception. Her transparency and detached self-awareness is symbolized by her job as a stripper.The other three torture themselves and each other with superficial truths while engaging in compulsive deception about their actions and actual feelings, to each other and to themselves. Their duplicity is symbolized by their occupations. Dan is an obit writer, skilled in the use of euphemisms to disguise the unflattering characteristics of the deceased. Anna is a photographer, skilled in freezing a single moment in time uncharacteristic of the actual subject she is representing. Larry is a dermatologist focused on the superficial surface that one publicly presents.The key exchange occurs early in the film as Alice and Dan discuss how essential euphemisms are in his job:Alice: What would my euphemism be? Dan: She was... disarming. Alice: That's not a euphemism. Dan: Yes, it is.Alice's up-front and open behavior causes him to let down his guard and feel a higher level of emotion, but his need to make new conquests and to test his attractiveness soon reasserts itself. She is willing to forgive this until finally convinced that he cannot transcend something so much a part of his basic nature.  With this realization she falls out of love.""Closer"" is much like ""XX/XY"" in its exploration of the mysteries of male discontent although it is philosophically deeper and much better written. Mark Ruffalo plays Coles (the Dan character in that film), but Law's portrayal is more convincing because he does not have to alternate between rebel and wimp, something that Ruffalo could not quite pull off.All four performances are solid although Roberts is given very little with which to work. Portman is especially good.

884535,A1PL8JA0TEHBVN,B0007OCG4W,Paulo Leite,"[7, 11]","I liked this film very much.The screenplay (adapted by the author of the original stageplay) is very well written. The story revolves around four people (you know who) who meet pretty much by chance (how modern...) and keep falling in and out of love with each other. Sounds simple? It is not. They cheat, they hurt, they lie, they cry... all between four people.But to me, the most interesting thing about this screenplay is the way the passing of the time is shown. It is hard to explain... we follow small moments of each couple's life and... suddenly there are jumps forward where big chunks of story left unseen suddenly became past. Clever, simple and intelligent. Frankly I haven't seen a script like this in years.Now the actors... oh, the actors... you can't get any better. Roberts, Law, Portman and Owen are simply top. Enough said?Some people (in other reviews) seemed to feel bothered by the cruel/explicit language in this film (may I remind you this is rated R). According to them, people do not talk like this. Maybe not. But people tend to forget that this film is written like a game and a puzzle. Many times, the screenplay engages in word playing (something that comes from the original source of this material: the stage). In a way, the film kept some of the word puzzles (which is not how people talk). Strange: nobody complains when Shakespeare does that... (laughs)On the other side, the screenplay clearly exaggerates some explicitness because in this operation lies many of the feelings we would not see had they done otherwise. The explicitness here may not be real... but the feelings are. And those dialogues shine because they go higher than reality.So maybe 50% of the dialogues may be too explicit or may be different from the way people talk... so what? in this film I think it is clearly justified... because other more subtler things than reality are at play. In fact, there is a lot of reality here that is put aside for (let's call it) poetic reasons... so the story can get to a certain point... so this character can end up this way... (think about the role coincidence plays here... think about all the things that would and could never happen in real life...)

Are you satisfied when you love somebody and that somebody love you back?  Do you yearn to have the feeling of love even when you know that both of you are living a pack of lies?  When the love is gone, do you let that other person go?  Isn't it that when you love somebody, you set them free?  Isn't love selfish, though?  When you can't have them or won't have them, do you intentionally wish to inflict hurt and emotionally scar to others?  Love is an intangible and subjective being.  It's not there and yet, it's there.  ""Closer"" is an autopsy (deliberately clinical in this instance) of love, loved, in and out of love.  Jude Law portrays a character, Dan that is a splitting image of his true self.  Can readers recall of him having a fling with his nanny when he was already engaged to Sienna Miller, and who he had a relationship with when he was not technically divorced from his first wife?  Talking about art imitates real life?  Then, there's Natalie Portman in her breaking or coming of age role as a stripper.  She does reveal a lot of flesh in this instance and I simply couldn't get over the fact that Princess Amidala was doing lap dance for Clive Owen!  Julia Roberts plays a photographer who captures portraits of sad and lonely people.  Perhaps, she sees her own self in their reflections and in this movie, she would bounce from one relationship to one another and back again because she doesn't wish to be hurt emotionally no more.  Clive's character as a dermatologist is the most lucid character here, brutally frank and honest or a straight shooter.  From outset, he might look like a brute but as the movie dwelves deeper, we start to understand that what you see is what you get from him.  To simplify the description here, ladies here in the form of Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman are those that have built fortress around themselves so that their emotions become unscathed from any relationships that didn't work out their ways, Jude Law is a conniving and selfish lover who interprets love as he pleases and guys that rationalise their doings as the right things to do when they leave a lot of casualties along the way and lastly, Clive is those men that are caught in the crossfire, someone who is realistic about relationship and someone that differentiates between love and lust and someone who is there to ensure the relationship he commits himself into works.

884542,AKI1CK229BDUC,B0007OCG4W,PsyRC,"[0, 0]","In this film, the overarching story is one of futile sexuality, a sexuality that is used in a counter-intuitively destructive manner.  Consummation is procured not with the intention of creating life, but of harming another person.  And, as much as animalistic allusions are referred to and this seemingly incessant drive to reach a state of primitive ecstasy is echoed time and again, whenever sexual acts are described, they are done so in a dehumanized, emotionless manner, as if to say that they can only exist as an abstraction.  This is reinforced by the fact that the acts are never actually shown, only talked about.Julia Roberts portrays perhaps the most tragic character of all, as she becomes the ""sad stranger"" in an ever-changing partner merry-go-round, yet, as Larry put it, she does not want to be happy, and has to compromise in order to avoid being swallowed by uncertainty.  As she kisses Dan at the beginning of the film, her camera goes off, and she immediately stops... she makes sad strangers look beautiful in photographs, and when her picture is taken, she runs the risk of looking beautiful, a threat which proves too big.Equally living in a psychogenic vortex is Dan himself, who pines for his mother every night and tries to sublimate this by engaging in intercourse with unknown women, he cannot risk becoming dependent on someone who may ultimately leave him (as parents almost inexorably do).  He desires Anna ""because she doesn't need"" him.  When he's on the computer talking to Larry, he personifies his conflict well.  He cannot have the desired object, thus he must become the object, and control her fate... he pretends to have an orgasm as Anna, yet says it was not good, closing in the fantasy that he is the only man who can provide Anna with a pleasurable sexual experience, he controls her orgasmic thrill, as it was.

It is an intense film with complex characters who become involved in adulterous relationships. The character's motivations are difficult to interpret, especially at the beginning. Throughout the film you watch them evolve and eventually they become the exact opposite of how they began. Especially the male characters, Dan (Jude Law) and Larry (Clive Owen). Dan starts out as a bit of a mysterious, quiet, romantic man whereas Larry displays a fiery quality and an almost violent temper. After the events of the story unfold, Dan has become violent whereas Larry has settled down. The female characters, Alice (Natalie Portman) and Anna (Julia Roberts) also undergo changes after their experiences. They ""find"" themselves and discover the extent of what they are capable of, specifically in terms of commitment.Although the plot centers around adultery and explicit sexual behavior, the actual intercourse is never witnessed. This adds to the film's mysterious quality and allows the audience to feel as if they are experiencing the lying and the betrayal just as the characters are. There are several motifs used in the film, including the use of opera music to signify a highly intense moment, the use of a blank white screen to signify the passage of time, and the use of fish or aquariums to signify both the simplicity and the complexity the adulterous relationships. All of these motifs are well formulated into the film.""Closer"" is well written and the parts are performed with precision. The actors convey raw human emotion at the appropriate times, almost making the viewer forget they are watching fictional characters. The destructiveness of adultery, the need to quench one's thirst for revenge, the lengths that love will drive us to, and the bitterness of truth are all themes within the film that people in the everyday world can relate to.

884552,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0007OCG4W,Robert Moore,"[10, 19]","CLOSER suffers from the staginess and inertia that plagues many film adaptations of stage plays, and the script sometimes reminded me a great deal of a very good imitation of Harold Pinter that just failed to be as good, but nonetheless this is a fascinating film to watch because of a bunch of outstanding performances by the four principle actors.  Although this is being primarily promoted as a Julia Roberts film that also stars the ubiquitous Jude Law, she is actually the least important of the main roles and is largely eclipsed by Natalie Portman.  Indeed, with Julia now at age 37 and about to enter a critical stage in her career as an actress, Natalie Portman could well be poised to be one of the actresses that take her place.  She is young, very beautiful (and with the body to perform a long scene very nearly nude), and enormously intelligent.  I don't think she has reached her potential yet, but her ceiling is very, very high.  So far her career has been slowed by her dedication to completing her education at Harvard, but I think that we are going to see her career as an actress take off now.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if she were to receive an Oscar nomination for this film.  I would be quite surprised if she doesn't win a Best Actress award at some point in the future.  Julia is quite good but her role isn't written to express as much personality as is Portman's, or for the two male leads for that matter.  I have always enjoyed Jude Law as an actor, but I wonder if Jude fatigue isn't beginning to set in.  I cannot remember such a large deluge by a single leading actor in such a short time, and moreover he has one more film coming out this holiday season.  Nonetheless, he was excellent, as always, as the rather unpleasant Daniel. Clive Owen is one of the more fascinating actors to arise in recent years, but I found him less effective in this film than in some others.  He has magnificently expressive eyes, but does better in roles in which he expresses himself more subtly than in this film.  He wasn't over the top, but he did come very close to being too expressive.  All in all, however, this film contained many utterly marvelous performances.The script was both a strength and the major weakness of the film.  Although the screenplay ultimately fails to make an especially coherent point about the nature of relationships and the kind of deceptions that populate them (along with rather mundane references to how we are all strangers to one another), Patrick Marber's screenplay (which he adapted from his play) does manage to create four strong characters who are notable for the strange dance of betrayal that they all play among themselves.  They are all much colder and nastier than real human beings are likely to be, but not less fascinating for all that.  The film ultimately fails to make much sense out of the entire role that deception plays in Alice's pretense to being someone that she really wasn't, all the way to adopting a fake name during the entirety of her relationship with Dan.  All in all, this is a film that you will enjoy for the performances, but which will delight less the more that you think about it later.I would make a strong recommendation for an older film that manages to address the same topic in more powerful fashion and with even better acting, the 1983 film version of Harold Pinter's BETRAYAL, starring Ben Kingsley, Jeremy Irons, and Patricia Hodge.  I personally would rather watch Pinter than someone writing in the style of Pinter.",4,Outstanding performances bring stage play to life on screen,1101945600,"12 2, 2004",2004,3525,"['CLOSER', 'suffers', 'staginess', 'inertia', 'many', 'film', 'adaptations', 'stage', 'plays', 'script', 'sometimes', 'reminded', 'great', 'deal', 'very', 'good', 'imitation', 'Harold', 'Pinter', 'just', 'failed', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'nonetheless', 'fascinating', 'film', 'watch', 'bunch', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'four', 'principle', 'actors', 'being', 'primarily', 'promoted', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'film', 'also', 'ubiquitous', 'Jude', 'Law', 'actually', 'least', 'important', 'main', 'roles', 'largely', 'eclipsed', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Indeed', 'Julia', 'now', 'age', '37', 'enter', 'critical', 'stage', 'career', 'actress', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'poised', 'be', 'one', 'actresses', 'take', 'place', 'young', 'very', 'beautiful', 'body', 'perform', 'long', 'scene', 'very', 'nearly', 'nude', 'enormously', 'intelligent', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'reached', 'potential', 'yet', 'ceiling', 'very', 'very', 'high', 'So', 'far', 'career', 'been', 'slowed', 'dedication', 'completing', 'education', 'Harvard', 'think', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'career', 'actress', 'take', 'off', 'now', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'were', 'receive', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'surprised', ""n't"", 'win', 'Best', 'Actress', 'award', 'point', 'future', 'Julia', 'quite', 'good', 'role', ""n't"", 'written', 'express', 'as', 'much', 'personality', 'Portman', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'matter', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Jude', 'Law', 'actor', 'wonder', 'Jude', 'fatigue', ""n't"", 'beginning', 'set', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'such', 'large', 'deluge', 'single', 'leading', 'actor', 'such', 'short', 'time', 'moreover', 'one', 'more', 'film', 'coming', 'out', 'holiday', 'season', 'Nonetheless', 'was', 'excellent', 'always', 'rather', 'unpleasant', 'Daniel', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'one', 'more', 'fascinating', 'actors', 'arise', 'recent', 'years', 'found', 'less', 'effective', 'film', 'others', 'magnificently', 'expressive', 'eyes', 'better', 'roles', 'more', 'subtly', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'top', 'did', 'come', 'very', 'close', 'being', 'too', 'expressive', 'however', 'film', 'contained', 'many', 'utterly', 'marvelous', 'performances.The', 'script', 'was', 'strength', 'major', 'weakness', 'film', 'screenplay', 'ultimately', 'make', 'especially', 'coherent', 'point', 'nature', 'relationships', 'kind', 'deceptions', 'populate', 'rather', 'mundane', 'references', 'how', 'are', 'strangers', 'one', 'Patrick', 'Marber', 'screenplay', 'adapted', 'play', 'manage', 'create', 'four', 'strong', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'notable', 'strange', 'dance', 'betrayal', 'play', 'are', 'much', 'colder', 'nastier', 'real', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'not', 'less', 'fascinating', 'film', 'ultimately', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'entire', 'role', 'deception', 'plays', 'Alice', 'pretense', 'being', 'someone', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'way', 'adopting', 'fake', 'name', 'entirety', 'relationship', 'Dan', 'film', 'will', 'enjoy', 'performances', 'will', 'delight', 'less', 'more', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'strong', 'recommendation', 'older', 'film', 'address', 'same', 'topic', 'more', 'powerful', 'fashion', 'even', 'better', 'acting', '1983', 'film', 'version', 'Harold', 'Pinter', 'BETRAYAL', 'starring', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Patricia', 'Hodge', 'personally', 'would', 'rather', 'watch', 'Pinter', 'someone', 'writing', 'style', 'Pinter']",N/A

Finally, a film has arrived that shows love for what it really is--a convoluted cycle of jealousy and dependency that materializes in the need to become ""closer"" to another human being.  It was raw, depressing, chilling, disturbing and strangely romantic.  There was minimal nudity, and no sexual content, so it is not disturbing in a visual way.  The film's dialogue and fierce acting demands attention from the audience.  We are not spoon-fed a ""timeless love story"" where everybody finds inner peace and virginal romance in the end.  We identify with the characters, who each reflect the dirtiness and truthfulness that hides beneath our fake veneers.  There is no sincere apologies for any wrongs committed.

884555,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0007OCG4W,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 3]","Based on the stage play by Patrick Marber, Mike Nichols' ""Closer"" is a generally uncompromising look at that great big messy thing we call love.  The movie views romance as a kind of high stakes parlor game in which men and women jockey for positions of power, use sex and deception as weapons to annihilate their opponents or get what they want, and wind up settling for safety over passion when it's time to get on with their lives.  ""Closer"" also acknowledges the sad truth that, when it comes to love, we tend to want what we do not have, then lose interest once the desired object is attained.Marber has written a complex screenplay centered around four major characters.  Dan is an unsuccessful novelist who meets and falls in love with Alice, a young American living in London.  Julia Roberts plays a professional photographer named Anna, another American transplant, who has her first encounter with Dan when he comes to her studio to have some portraits taken of him.  A mutual attraction develops between the two of them despite Dan's purported love for Alice.  The fourth main character is a doctor named Larry who meets Anna and falls in love with her even though Anna's real obsession seems to be Dan.For the next couple of years, the relationships between these four characters undergo tremendous transformations, forming and re-forming, grouping and re-grouping, until even the individuals involved no longer know what they feel or who they want.  All they know is that happiness always seems to be vaguely out of reach because the person each of them is involved with has either moved on to someone else or has lost interest in the relationship.  The film often condenses time by leapfrogging over months and years between major scenes without a great deal of transition, forcing us to pay rapt attention at all points throughout the movie.Since ""Closer"" is derived from a stage play, it's not always successful at hiding its theatrical roots.  Sometimes that's a good thing as when the movie achieves a sealed-off, claustrophobic atmosphere that enhances the personal drama.  Like a lot of stage writing, the dialogue is often literate, sharp and insightful, but, towards the end, it occasionally feels a bit too clever and artificial for its own good.  Once the characters start articulating the ""great truths"" of their lives, they lose authenticity and become mouthpieces for the author.  And after about an hour of watching them sabotage their own happiness and listening to them whine about their lives, your patience and empathy may begin to run a bit thin, undercutting some of the positive feelings you've developed towards the movie in the first half.In terms of the acting, three of the four leads - Law, Roberts and Natalie Portman - all deliver strong, subtle performances, but Clive Owen hits too many false notes, especially when he is called upon to emote to any great extent.  Still, the others draw us into their insulated little world of drama and woe just enough to make us interested in what's taking place in their lives and damn thankful we aren't a part of it.If for nothing else, ""Closer"" deserves plaudits for a clever, dead-on, hilarious and brilliantly sustained comic sequence involving internet cyber sex.

Well, as soon as the credits rolled, and the lights came up, every single high hope I had was met.The story itself is fairly simple, focusing on a small cast, keeping all parts equal, and giving each character a good chance at depth.  The actors take those roles, mearly frames at first, and give them depth, power.  Each look, each glance, hints at another dark secret that is locked away in the character's minds.  I have to say, the cast was amazing, especially Natalie Portman, who sheds her good girl image, and dives head first in to a dark, and challenging role.  If this doesn't cement her as one of the strongest actresses out there, then I don't know what will.  Julia Roberts takes a very different character from anything I've ever seen her play in the past, and keeps her real.  Her character is weak, with a strong outer shell.  That inner vulnerability is captured so well.  Clive Owen was the perfect actor for his part, hitting every hard edged emotional note.  The weakest performance, and I'm using this term loosely, due to the fact that it was still an amazing performance, was Jude Law, playing a character who really is never fully grounded.  It is less because of his acting skills, and more because the character himself is so flighty (intentionally) that I could never really get in to what he wanted.The direction is strong, making every scene a joy to watch.  The lighting is top notch, especially in more out there scenes, such as the strip club, and the music blends with the situations so well, that it seems to be a fifth actor in the room, helping magnify all the other performances.I would highly recommend this movie.

884557,A9LNWA25IM2DX,B0007OCG4W,"R.Suarez ""R-Suarez-""","[3, 6]","Based on the original play by Patrick Marber, Mike Nichols delivers an interesting adaptation which only flaw seems to be that play like feeling in some parts of the movie.  `Closer' tells the story of four people whose lives get connected to one another's in the most dysfunctional ways.I had never seen a movie about relationships that portrayed so realistically all the ups and downs. The movie opens with Dan and Alice meeting and falling in love in a quite traditional and romantic way, with the beautiful `Blower's daughter' in the background. Going from there we get to see a story of betrayal and a well earned lack of trust in the relationships of these four characters. I won't give away the plot like many other reviewers already did, but these characters are lovable even when they have no respect for anything, even when they break the hearts of the ones that love them.The approach to relationships in this story is crude and erotic, there are situations in which the dialogues will just blow you away, and these moments are mostly because of the well chosen cast and a very good direction. Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Clive Owen and even Julia Roberts deliver some  moments that are sometimes hard to digest and/or believe, the discussions and the openness of the things they say one another are great contributions to the story.Like said before, the only apparent flaw this movie has is the use of the timeframes, one moment you are watching a regular sequence and in the next cut a year has passed already, with no explanation at all, you will have to guess based on the situations and the subtle changes perceived (forget about titles saying `One year later', there's nothing of that here) This situation can make it difficult to some people to watch and understand completely the film. Other than that, the direction, photography and performance of the cast are breathtaking.The movie has no extras at all (I do not consider previews for other films as extras, hope you agree) besides Damien Rice's music video for `The Blower's daughter', which will be enough for fans of the film.

That line, said by Jude Law's Dan deep within the perplexing Closer, can perhaps sum up the entire film in one quote. It's this kind of BRILLIANT, snappy dialogue that makes Closer the second best film of the year.This is a film about human vice. Although Dan (Law) and Larry (Clive Owen) have given up smoking, they still indulge in internet sex chat rooms. Alice (Natalie Portman) is a stripper, and Anna (Julia Roberts) is in her own way a voyeur through her photography. These people are flawed, yet a flicker of humanity exists in each of them still--and it will all be gone by the end of the film. It tells us the story over the course of four years, where Dan gets invoved with Alice through a happenstance encounter, and then later meets Anna, and has an affair with her. She marries Larry, and so forth. There is couple switching, backstabbing, foulmouthes, and lyin', cheatin' hearts.I'm going to go all the way and say that this is the best acted film since In the Bedroom, and I'll even say that it features some of the most deliciously satisfying verbal confrontations since Mike Nichols' debut in 1966 of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? The volley between Larry and Anna when he confronts her about his sex habits with Dan is the best piece of acting I have seen all year. The way she says ""it tastes like you but sweeter"" is so cold and would be very disarming if Larry was not such a stone. Then he says ""that's the spirit. Thanks for the honest. Now f*ck off and die."" In a way, the scene is earthshattering to the point where we are weakened from complete and utter guilt. We are these characters. These are people. Real people.Clive Owen and Natalie Portman give arguably the best supporting performances of the year (especially from the strip club scene), and Jude Law and Julia Roberts are also fantastic. Yes, it's difficult to stomach Roberts speaking of such matters as ""coming"" and oral sex, but it's great to see a change. They each inhabit the characters and brilliantly exemplify their range of complicated emotion. Closer is filled with these complicated emotions.

Usually, I would call that a blessing but given the bleak message here I'm not sure that's the case. It deals with four people, two men and two women, who are divided into couples but the couples change throughout the film. Jude Law plays Dan, a sweet-talking philanderer. He's the type of guy who couldn't hurt a fly but leaves a trail of destruction wherever he goes. Natalie Portman is his long-suffering girlfriend Alice. Julia Roberts is Anna, a photographer who catches Dan's eye and Clive Owen plays Larry, Ana's dermatologist husband.The movie isn't about relationships as much is it about the mythology surrounding them. The characters espouse their love for one another while they do terrible things to each other. It isn't until the end of the movie that some of them even realize what love really is. It draws a stark line between love and sex. Sex is selfish and love is giving. Throughout the film, the characters greet each other with the line ""hello, stranger."" That seems to be the central theme of the movie, no matter how close we think we are, we will always remain strangers. In the end, one of the couples stays together while the other breaks up. The one that stays together does so because they are willing to accept each other, flaws and all.The film is wonderfully acted and features tight scripting and excellent cinematography shot around London.

If your best friend said that there was a new movie about love and romance and it stars Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, and Jude Law (plus the rakishly handsome Clive Owen), you'd probably leap to the conclusion that a studio had tried to make ""Love Actually II"" or some other sappy romantic comedy.Nothing could be further from the truth.  In a movie that revolves intensely around the four leads as two couples who, shall we say, ""interact,"" it's hard to find a likable chap or gal.  Selfishness and betrayal rule the day, along with graphic language about sex.  I'm not talking overly clinical language, I'm talking about the language of people who use sex as a means to establish dominance and superiority, not intimacy or even enjoyment.  Guilt and shame are at least as prevalent as love and affection, and truth may be the rarest commodity of all.Be warned -- this is not a feel-good movie in any way.  That's not to say that it's a ""bad movie,"" of course.  My three-star rating stems from the fact that the movie spans a few years, yet the transitions between leaps forward and flashes back are confusing, and the characters generally talk like movie characters and not real people (listening to Jude Law explain his job as a writer of obituaries rings false, and I'm not sure a woman like Natalie Portman's character ""Alice"" has ever walked the earth).Still, if you're looking for a dark examination of the war between the sexes (and we are talking about war), and you've worn out your copy of ""In the Company of Men,"" or you find ""The War of the Roses"" too cheery, this may be just the movie for you.",3,Dark tale of selfish love and infidelity among unlikeable foursome,1132876800,"11 25, 2005",2005,1732,"['Closer', 'nothing', 'else', 'refreshing', 'change', 'major', 'movie', 'releases', 'truly', 'established', 'formulas', 'best', 'friend', 'said', 'was', 'new', 'movie', 'love', 'romance', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Jude', 'Law', 'rakishly', 'handsome', 'Clive', 'Owen', ""'d"", 'probably', 'leap', 'conclusion', 'studio', 'had', 'tried', 'make', 'Love', 'Actually', 'II', 'other', 'sappy', 'romantic', 'comedy.Nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'movie', 'intensely', 'four', 'leads', 'two', 'couples', 'who', 'shall', 'say', 'interact', 'hard', 'find', 'likable', 'chap', 'gal', 'Selfishness', 'betrayal', 'rule', 'day', 'graphic', 'language', 'sex', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'overly', 'clinical', 'language', ""'m"", 'talking', 'language', 'people', 'who', 'use', 'sex', 'means', 'establish', 'dominance', 'superiority', 'not', 'intimacy', 'even', 'enjoyment', 'Guilt', 'shame', 'are', 'least', 'as', 'prevalent', 'love', 'affection', 'truth', 'may', 'be', 'rarest', 'commodity', 'all.Be', 'warned', 'not', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'way', 'not', 'say', 'bad', 'movie', 'course', 'three-star', 'rating', 'fact', 'movie', 'few', 'years', 'yet', 'transitions', 'leaps', 'forward', 'flashes', 'back', 'are', 'confusing', 'characters', 'generally', 'talk', 'movie', 'characters', 'not', 'real', 'people', 'listening', 'Jude', 'Law', 'explain', 'job', 'writer', 'obituaries', 'rings', 'false', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'woman', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'character', 'Alice', 'ever', 'walked', 'earth', '.Still', ""'re"", 'looking', 'dark', 'examination', 'war', 'sexes', 'are', 'talking', 'war', ""'ve"", 'worn', 'out', 'copy', 'Company', 'Men', 'find', 'War', 'Roses', 'too', 'cheery', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'movie']",N/A

Alice (Portman) used to work as a stripper in the Big Apple and ran away looking for a new start. A relationship starts building, but when Anna (Roberts), a professional photographer, crosses their path, things start to get complicated. And when Larry (Owen), a dermatologist, finds Anna as the result of a prank played on him, the four characters get entangled in a web of relationships that gets boring fast and drags the movie into a limbo, in which it remains until the end.As I mentioned, the only aspect of this movie I consider to be praiseworthy is the acting, but for someone that is looking to be entertained for a couple of hours that is not enough.

Why do we always hurt the ones we love? Those questions are the basis for Mike Nichols' ""Closer"", a film about casual betrayals between our loved ones.

Jude Law's role is somewhat similar from his past roles but still manages to give a solid preformance. It's no wonder who the stand outs are. Natalie Portman proves that she's capable of handling herself in all situations most notably where she shares a scene in a strip club with Clive Owen's character. It's both daring and impressive. Clive Owen is of course another other stand out. He probably has the best line in the film, ""Have you ever seen a human heart? It looks like a fist wrapped in blood!"" This brings me to another great stand out; the dialogue. Since it was originally written for the stage, most of the dialogue is acted out very theatrically which some viewers may love or hate.

""Sex and the City"" or ""Sidewalks of New York"" had the good sense to play out such emotional faux-pas with a streak of humor. ""In The Company of Men"" showed characters with cruelty but reflected the brutal nature of the corporate world they inhabited. ""We Dont Live Here Anymore"" laid out marital quandaries in painstaking detail.Closer simply lacks such a trope. Its characters resemble stray leaves caught in the windstorm of an urban existence. We never see them happy, we seldom see them being genuinely romantic (beyond first overtures, where most of the film's endurability is located), or even in a state of peaceful equilibrium. When their libido ruins bonds we find it tough to root for them, all we see is dysfunction.It's the acting that rises over the rubble of a poor script and makes this film watchable. Jude Law's character is slime personified, and he does well to embody it. Natalie Portman plays a stripper (who mysteriously has her tops on even in a stripping sequence) and for a 24-year old she packs in a lot of punch. Julia Roberts is somewhat bland in portraying a character whose motivations rarely make any sense.But the real winner is Clive Owen, who finally shows some of the potential I've been suspecting for a while, especially after his imposing cameo in King Arthur. He plays the rough, voyeuristic doctor, the only person in the film capable of cutting to the heart of the blather around him. Grungy, no B.S.

Most movies that are adapted from Broadway plays don't fair well on screen unless they're made from the classic playwrights (Tennessee Williams, David Mamet, Eugene O'Neill, etc.).  Many of the negative reviews here on Amazon.com expecting more action are justified.  However, I found the movie to be better than expected.  Mike Nichols is one of Hollywood's finest directors.  And with four of the best actors around, he does very will with the challenging subject matter.  Natalie Portman has become the ""Harrison Ford"" of the Star Wars genre by breaking out into a great Oscar nominated role.

884576,A3O9S9HQMKCUJR,B0007OCG4W,"Stephen Broome ""Anti-Noodling Consortium""","[3, 9]","Despite being filled with big name, mainstream Hollywood actors, Closer is a deceivingly unflinching look at... well... [prostitute]and pimps. And even enduring at times ridiculous dialogue, the portrayal is consistently morose. For a lack of a better term the four people at the center of this film, Alice(Natalie Portman), Anna(Julia Roberts), Daniel (Jude Law) and Larry (Clive Owen) are simply running the routine of organized, incestuous prostitution. One's opinion of it largely depends on their interest of watching an at times uncomfortably vulgar display of the underbelly of relationships. There are very few public moments to speak of, and the sex and arguments are often captured at times of cruelty or perversion.Set in modern day England, Closer is the vignette styled tale of defining moments in time for four characters whose lives mix, mingle and match poorly over the course of several years. The first relationship is established as Alice (pimp), an American distracted by her attraction to a strange Englishman named Daniel ([prostitute]), is hit by a truck. Their `love' blossoms as a portent to Daniel's fatal flaw, his physical and sexual attraction to misery and pain. Much like the photography at the center of the story, Alice is a picture of frigid contempt masked in a beautiful face, and Daniel as a whore for misery is naturally drawn to her. Looking to leave his life as an obituary writer two years later, Daniel is being photographed by Anna(pimp) when their relationship begins. With Daniel now living with Alice, the time jumping merry go round of relationships begins as the interminably depressive Anna passively allows Daniel to become her whore. While a superficial viewing may indicate that Anna is a loose woman who has been a repeated victim in her relationships, every move she makes in this movie is of her own volition, and every relationship in some way makes her miserable enough to make her happy. Whether it be poor timing, incompatibility, or demeaning sex, everything is of her doing.Eventually through an extremely odd meeting orchestrated indirectly and pretty unbelievably by Daniel, Anna and Larry begin a relationship. Larry ([prostitute]) obsessed with and a slave to the power of sexuality itself, serves as the polar opposite of Alice, whose veil of simplistic sexuality gives her the power of a pimp with the appearance of a whore. Eventually their relationship develops briefly from this as Larry is tormented by Alice's refusal to give him any of her sexual power. Affairs happen over the next few years, relationships begin, end, and begin again, and at last, there is a very happy resolution. Yet the great storytelling device is that as always in life things are relative to and bound by context. What is a happy ending for baseless, immoral, vulgar people may not constitute a finality many people want from a movie. What constitutes a character arc in other movies is, for people as guardedly selfish with their emotions as these, simply an arc of actions and thoughts. There are no hearts to speak of, and is it really that unrealistic that people in their 30's and 40's would have long since stopped developing as human beings? In this sense it's one of the more honest movies in recent years, although not necessarily romantic.The negatives are limited but as everything else in this movie, glaring. The excessive vulgarity of the language - while an understandable metaphor of the sometimes disgusting nature of honesty - may be jarring as it takes away from sincere character interaction. As a case study it not only works fine but is explained several times during the movie. Lies are more `attractive' and `fun', so when people are revealing genuine feelings to one another the dialogue descends to a level not often heard outside of pornography. The correctness of the motive behind the decision does not mean the decision was correct in itself. Language without cursing can also be brutally honest and hurtful and not have such a huge deviation from the speaking voices established by the characters. Without any suggestion (i.e.these are all victims of dual personalities) it makes zero sense.That being said the direction is relaxed and never distracting and the music is appropriately... not noticeable. The question is rarely raised this strongly in a mainstream release, what do you want a movie to give you? If you're looking for staged, exaggerated, at times silly, but in the end brutally honest relationships, this movie works about 80% of the time, down to an outstanding, logical conclusion.Review by Steve Broome",4,Good stuff,1139011200,"02 4, 2006",2006,4600,"['being', 'filled', 'big', 'name', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'Closer', 'deceivingly', 'unflinching', 'look', 'well', '[', 'prostitute', ']', 'pimps', 'even', 'enduring', 'times', 'ridiculous', 'dialogue', 'portrayal', 'consistently', 'morose', 'lack', 'better', 'term', 'four', 'people', 'center', 'film', 'Alice', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Anna', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Daniel', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Larry', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'are', 'simply', 'running', 'routine', 'organized', 'incestuous', 'prostitution', 'One', 'opinion', 'largely', 'interest', 'watching', 'times', 'uncomfortably', 'vulgar', 'display', 'underbelly', 'relationships', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'public', 'moments', 'speak', 'sex', 'arguments', 'are', 'often', 'captured', 'times', 'cruelty', 'perversion.Set', 'modern', 'day', 'England', 'Closer', 'vignette', 'styled', 'tale', 'defining', 'moments', 'time', 'four', 'characters', 'lives', 'mix', 'mingle', 'match', 'poorly', 'course', 'several', 'years', 'first', 'relationship', 'established', 'Alice', 'pimp', 'American', 'distracted', 'attraction', 'strange', 'Englishman', 'named', 'Daniel', '[', 'prostitute', ']', 'hit', 'truck', 'love', 'blossoms', 'portent', 'Daniel', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'physical', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'misery', 'pain', 'Much', 'photography', 'center', 'story', 'Alice', 'picture', 'frigid', 'contempt', 'masked', 'beautiful', 'face', 'Daniel', 'whore', 'misery', 'naturally', 'drawn', 'Looking', 'leave', 'life', 'obituary', 'writer', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'Daniel', 'being', 'photographed', 'Anna', 'pimp', 'when', 'relationship', 'Daniel', 'now', 'living', 'Alice', 'time', 'jumping', 'merry', 'go', 'round', 'relationships', 'begins', 'interminably', 'depressive', 'Anna', 'passively', 'Daniel', 'become', 'whore', 'superficial', 'viewing', 'may', 'indicate', 'Anna', 'loose', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'repeated', 'victim', 'relationships', 'move', 'movie', 'own', 'volition', 'relationship', 'way', 'miserable', 'enough', 'make', 'happy', 'be', 'poor', 'timing', 'incompatibility', 'demeaning', 'sex', 'everything', 'doing.Eventually', 'extremely', 'odd', 'meeting', 'orchestrated', 'indirectly', 'pretty', 'unbelievably', 'Daniel', 'Anna', 'Larry', 'begin', 'relationship', 'Larry', '[', 'prostitute', ']', 'obsessed', 'slave', 'power', 'sexuality', 'polar', 'opposite', 'Alice', 'veil', 'simplistic', 'sexuality', 'power', 'pimp', 'appearance', 'whore', 'Eventually', 'relationship', 'briefly', 'Larry', 'tormented', 'Alice', 'refusal', 'give', 'sexual', 'power', 'happen', 'next', 'few', 'years', 'relationships', 'begin', 'end', 'begin', 'again', 'last', 'very', 'happy', 'resolution', 'great', 'storytelling', 'device', 'always', 'life', 'things', 'are', 'relative', 'bound', 'context', 'What', 'happy', 'ending', 'baseless', 'immoral', 'vulgar', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'constitute', 'finality', 'many', 'people', 'want', 'movie', 'What', 'character', 'arc', 'other', 'movies', 'people', 'guardedly', 'selfish', 'emotions', 'simply', 'arc', 'actions', 'thoughts', 'are', 'hearts', 'speak', 'really', 'unrealistic', 'people', '30', '40', 'would', 'have', 'long', 'stopped', 'developing', 'human', 'beings', 'sense', 'one', 'more', 'honest', 'movies', 'recent', 'years', 'not', 'necessarily', 'romantic.The', 'negatives', 'are', 'limited', 'everything', 'else', 'movie', 'glaring', 'excessive', 'vulgarity', 'language', 'understandable', 'metaphor', 'sometimes', 'disgusting', 'nature', 'honesty', 'may', 'be', 'jarring', 'away', 'sincere', 'character', 'interaction', 'case', 'study', 'not', 'only', 'fine', 'explained', 'several', 'times', 'movie', 'Lies', 'are', 'more', 'attractive', 'fun', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'revealing', 'genuine', 'feelings', 'one', 'dialogue', 'level', 'not', 'often', 'heard', 'pornography', 'correctness', 'motive', 'decision', 'not', 'mean', 'decision', 'was', 'correct', 'Language', 'cursing', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'brutally', 'honest', 'hurtful', 'not', 'have', 'such', 'huge', 'deviation', 'speaking', 'voices', 'established', 'characters', 'suggestion', 'i.e.these', 'are', 'victims', 'dual', 'personalities', 'zero', 'sense.That', 'being', 'said', 'direction', 'relaxed', 'never', 'distracting', 'music', 'appropriately', 'not', 'noticeable', 'question', 'rarely', 'raised', 'strongly', 'mainstream', 'release', 'what', 'do', 'want', 'movie', 'give', ""'re"", 'looking', 'staged', 'exaggerated', 'times', 'silly', 'end', 'brutally', 'honest', 'relationships', 'movie', 'about', '80', '%', 'time', 'down', 'outstanding', 'logical', 'conclusion.Review', 'Steve', 'Broome']",N/A

I say this because people I trust were unimpressed by it.  But I was compelled to watch the Mike Nichols' film for reasons that I can only describe as masochistic - and I'm not a masochist.  The characters are recognizable and reprehensible, pretty much the gang of healthy and privileged idiots you can meet anywhere in the U.S. or U.K., where the bulk of ""Closer"" takes place.  The story is a human traffic accident, literally in one scene and implied in another.  Though the dialogue is stagy, the actors deliver it with proper angst, which is suitable for a film that is really just barely a play with a few visual tricks thrown in.  (A lot in ""Closer"" happens offscreen and is told in flashback and expository dialogue, the film's major weakness).  Jude Law, who resembles rather disturbingly John Boy Walton when donning spectacles, plays a hack writer whose chance meeting with a provocateur (Natalie Portman -- kudos to her for being unafraid to reveal her burgeoning cellulite) and later dalliance with a wishy-washy photographer (Julia Roberts) leads to his eventual downfall.  Almost-James Bond (thank goodness) Clive Owen pops in as a dermatologist who isn't quite as thick skulled as he seems.  No one is likable in ""Closer,"" which may be part of the reason I enjoyed it; their folly seems to confirm so many of my own observations about people who are incapable of loving relationships with anyone because they don't know the first things about themselves.  Yet, fortune gives them a steady stream of paramours to damage.  Go figure.  Under Nichols' steady hand, including some verbal and visual cues that subtly forecast events, ""Closer"" wends its way to a conclusion that is inevitable and would be tragic if the characters were even remotely heroic.

884578,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B0007OCG4W,Steve,"[1, 2]","Truly the unique movie that has thoroughly divided audiences, Closer is either hated or loved. I tend towards the latter although I didn't love it. I can, however, appreciate the many qualities the movie has.Let me start by taking on the many critics who claim, with stunning arrogance, that the movie is unrealistic, or that these things never happen, or that these people are so vile that the movie isn't worth the time to watch. You couldn't be farther from the truth. First of all, the events these characters go through certainly do happen, even if comprehending such stark brutality makes you dangerously self-conscious and uncomfortable. It's one thing to dislike a movie because you found it distasteful; it's another to try to cover all of human experience with the narrow blanket made up of your own limited life and stifled imagination. Secondly, the utterly repellent nature of their actions doesn't make the movie unworthy of the time one spends watching it, even if there are terribly painful moments to endure.The four characters that make up this intense drama are cold blooded, unforgiving, self-destructive, selfish, and unable to distinguish between love and her twisted counter-ego, obsession. Clive Owen is the best part of this movie, from the moment we meet him through his confrontation with Jude Law, he is a boiling, sarcastic, and ruthless mess of a man. Matter of fact, no one in this movie is very likable, even the manipulative Alice, who from her name on down to her perfectly fitting occupation, rarely plays people honestly. She tries to play herself as this wounded victim, but she has more on the ball than she's given credit for. Witness the scene at the photography studio. Roberts and Law have the far less sympathetic roles to play; and Roberts plays hers emotionally detached and self-loathingly. Law is the romantic fool who doesn't know what he wants because he is emotionally immature.Closer is a movie that I would not recommend to the easily offended, the people who are uncomfortable with frank sexual discussion, or those who don't enjoy character studies with no real plot. For those of you, I'm sure there's something on Fox News Channel you'd enjoy much more than this movie. Just don't take a wrong turn and uncover Bill O'Reilly's Jenna Jameson collection.I would definitely recommend it for struggling couples, those contemplating divorce, or singles who never seem to be able to make relationships work. There are plenty of lessons these tortured characters can teach and I'm guessing that you'll see some of yourself in these four and their repeated mistakes. If you want to know the hell of a relationship's demise, or see how not knowing yourself handicaps your ability to successfully love and be loved in return, put on Closer, hold your breath, and open your eyes wide.",4,Painful study of relationships,1263600000,"01 16, 2010",2010,2829,"['Truly', 'unique', 'movie', 'thoroughly', 'divided', 'audiences', 'Closer', 'either', 'hated', 'loved', 'tend', 'latter', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'can', 'however', 'appreciate', 'many', 'qualities', 'movie', 'has.Let', 'start', 'taking', 'many', 'critics', 'who', 'claim', 'stunning', 'arrogance', 'movie', 'unrealistic', 'things', 'never', 'happen', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'movie', ""n't"", 'worth', 'time', 'watch', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'farther', 'truth', 'First', 'all', 'events', 'characters', 'go', 'certainly', 'do', 'happen', 'even', 'comprehending', 'such', 'stark', 'brutality', 'dangerously', 'self-conscious', 'uncomfortable', 'one', 'thing', 'dislike', 'movie', 'found', 'distasteful', 'try', 'cover', 'human', 'experience', 'narrow', 'blanket', 'made', 'own', 'limited', 'life', 'stifled', 'imagination', 'Secondly', 'utterly', 'repellent', 'nature', 'actions', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'unworthy', 'time', 'one', 'watching', 'even', 'are', 'terribly', 'painful', 'moments', 'endure.The', 'four', 'characters', 'make', 'up', 'intense', 'drama', 'are', 'cold', 'blooded', 'unforgiving', 'self-destructive', 'selfish', 'unable', 'distinguish', 'love', 'twisted', 'counter-ego', 'obsession', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'moment', 'meet', 'confrontation', 'Jude', 'Law', 'boiling', 'sarcastic', 'ruthless', 'mess', 'man', 'Matter', 'fact', 'one', 'movie', 'very', 'likable', 'even', 'manipulative', 'Alice', 'who', 'name', 'perfectly', 'fitting', 'occupation', 'rarely', 'people', 'honestly', 'play', 'wounded', 'victim', 'more', 'ball', 'given', 'credit', 'Witness', 'scene', 'photography', 'studio', 'Roberts', 'Law', 'have', 'far', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'roles', 'play', 'Roberts', 'hers', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'self-loathingly', 'Law', 'romantic', 'fool', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'emotionally', 'immature.Closer', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'easily', 'offended', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'frank', 'sexual', 'discussion', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'character', 'studies', 'real', 'plot', ""'m"", 'sure', 'something', 'Fox', 'News', 'Channel', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'wrong', 'turn', 'uncover', 'Bill', ""O'Reilly"", 'Jenna', 'Jameson', 'collection.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'struggling', 'couples', 'contemplating', 'divorce', 'singles', 'who', 'never', 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'relationships', 'work', 'are', 'plenty', 'lessons', 'tortured', 'characters', 'can', 'teach', ""'m"", 'guessing', ""'ll"", 'see', 'four', 'repeated', 'mistakes', 'want', 'know', 'hell', 'relationship', 'demise', 'see', 'how', 'not', 'knowing', 'handicaps', 'ability', 'successfully', 'love', 'be', 'loved', 'return', 'put', 'Closer', 'hold', 'breath', 'open', 'eyes', 'wide']",N/A

Both are excellent films though, despite the change.What elevates Closer from the pack is the writing. Patrick Marber wrote the play and also adapted the screenplay. If you have ever seen a TV series starring Steve Coogan, Marber probably wrote it. He has a talent for writing comedy and it's the type of comedy I like. That said, Closer is not a comedy; it's a drama with plenty of humor in it.Good actors can't really succeed without good writing, but this has both. All four do good work here. It has the feel of a Woody Allen film in some ways and also reminds me of Glengarry Glen Ross as both were adapted from plays. The dialogue comes at you at a fast pace and the actors play off one another well. Some conversations are a joy to experience.Both men sleep with both women (not at the same time) and the story deals with the relationships in an amusing way. The main point of the film is to show how much people lie to one another. Even when they think they are speaking absolute truth, it often turns out to be a lie. Are they saying these things to convince themselves of their good intentions? Are lies preferable to truth in some instances?The 104 minutes seem to pass very quickly. I was caught up in the story and the lives of these four people. It's more a romantic drama than a romantic comedy, despite the witty lines that appear throughout the story.I'm not sure which character I liked the most. They all have redeeming qualities. It's just a fun thing to experience and the writing is smart. I think the actors enjoyed delivering this wonderful dialogue.

While it plays with contrasting the Apollonian versus Dionysian energies of the two male characters, and the interplay of the scattered energies that the colliding relationships create, it somehow falls short of working, for me.Yes, it's about the futility of obsession, as was Lolita, and the underlying purity of Natalie Portman's character hints at a tip of the literary hat to Goethe's Faust, but Closer never settles into a believable flow.As far as the plot goes, Jude Law's Dan actually has the chance to be happy with both women at different times, but blows it by obsessing over details and control issues. So does the Sleazy Doc, but in a different way.Life is not about 'cheat but don't tell', it's about 'don't cheat', as Portman's Alice/Jane rightly suggested - that there is always a pivotal moment when you can stop yourself from falling in love inappropriately or creating an inappropriate  sexual liaison.Just be glad you are not inside their heads.",4,"Great cast, dark movie",1136160000,"01 2, 2006",2006,1220,"['be', 'honest', 'favorite', 'part', 'was', 'beautiful', 'video', ""'The"", 'Blower', 'Daughter', 'Damien', 'Rice', 'Lisa', 'Hannigan', 'Special', 'Features', 'Closer', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'premise', 'potential', 'generated', 'such', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'contrasting', 'Apollonian', 'versus', 'Dionysian', 'energies', 'two', 'male', 'characters', 'interplay', 'scattered', 'energies', 'colliding', 'relationships', 'create', 'somehow', 'short', 'working', 'me.Yes', 'futility', 'obsession', 'was', 'Lolita', 'underlying', 'purity', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'character', 'hints', 'tip', 'literary', 'hat', 'Goethe', 'Faust', 'Closer', 'never', 'believable', 'flow.As', 'far', 'plot', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Dan', 'actually', 'chance', 'be', 'happy', 'women', 'different', 'times', 'obsessing', 'over', 'details', 'control', 'issues', 'So', 'Sleazy', 'Doc', 'different', 'way.Life', 'not', ""'cheat"", 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', ""'do"", ""n't"", 'cheat', 'Portman', 'Alice/Jane', 'rightly', 'suggested', 'always', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'when', 'can', 'stop', 'falling', 'love', 'inappropriately', 'creating', 'inappropriate', 'sexual', 'liaison.Just', 'be', 'glad', 'are', 'not', 'heads']",N/A

With a world class director like Mike Nichols, and superb actors Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Jude Law, and Natalie Portman, not to mention stunning set design and glorious photography, how could this one lose?  It was not because it was shot in one of the world's most interesting cities (anybody who has ever been to London knows what a fabulous place it is.)  There just was not much all this super talent could do with dialogue that works on the stage but does not translate well to the screen.  Some plays simply should not be photographed.  Why this should be so is an unexplained mystery, but there it is, nonetheless.  At least there is a nice nude scene of Natalie Portman from the rear, but a second later she is telling her boy friend that she is waiting for him to leave her.  Are you kidding?  I am willing to suspend disbelief but that anyone would leave Natalie Portman strains disbelief to the breaking point.  Things like that happen in real life, but as Mark Twain said, fiction has to make sense.  I was also bewildered by the last scene, in which Natalie's character ends up back in New York.  Now that makes sense in real life, because New York is an even more fabulous city than London, but the scene does not seem to be motivated in the movie and leaves the viewer bewildered.Watch it if the sheer physical beauty of the film and a chance to watch some great actors is enough for you.

Danny gallantly takes her to the hospital to get stitched up.  They hit it off, and she tells him her name is Alice Ayres.  They move in together.Some time later, Danny, who has a day job writing obituaries and likes to have his crusts cut off the way Mummy used to do for him, publishes a book.  The novel is based on Alice's very interesting life (but we're not told much about the content of her life or his book).  He has his picture taken for the jacket of his book by Anna, another American woman who for some reason is also in London. Danny immediately hits on the gawky, gangly, flubby-lipped Anna.  She turns him away, once he admits that he and Alice are living together.  Anna seems to take note of the  fact that of course Danny is not bothered at all at the thought of cheating on his girlfriend. Alice comes to pick him up at the studio, and finds out that Anna and Danny have kissed.  Anna takes Alice's picture of her looking very sad, blows it up, and shows it at her photo exhibit a year later.In the meantime, Danny stalks Anna (while still living with Alice) and goes into sex chatrooms pretending to be her.  This results in Anna meeting and ultimately marrying Larry, an uncouth and crude dermatologist who was hoping to hook up with Anna, the sex demon (as portrayed by Danny).Danny and Anna end up cheating on their partners with each other.  Anna is worn down by his persistance, and Danny pursues her because ""she doesn't need him"".  They are both selfish and cowardly, and neither one really knows what it means to love.  When Anna consents to leave her husband and be with Danny, he tells Alice that he has been cheating on her and will be leaving her.  He says ""it just happened"".  Alice tells him there is always ""that moment"" when you can refuse or give in - apparently she didn't know her man too well as he was the one actively pursuing a forbidden relationship.I was happy at the ending - but not suprised - because Larry did tell Anna that Alice was ""sly"" - in a way, Larry was smarter than he acted, just not smart enough. The men in this movie did view ""love"" as a war, with the women as the territory.  One of them didn't care to be thought of that way, and she jumped ship.I give it only three stars (2 1/2 really) due to the jumping around of time.  Suddenly it's one year later.  Suddenly it's four months later. Etc.  Plus, there's more chemistry between Jude Law and Natalie Portman, than Jude Law and Julia Roberts, so why would he prefer Anna to Alice?

884587,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B0007OCG4W,Terry Mesnard,"[4, 5]","Closer is a unique movie in that it's not a typical Hollywood movie filled with Hollywood actors.  Part of the thrill, I think, people will get from the film is seeing ""Superstars"" acting dirty.  And you can certainly watch this film and get that thrill.  But, that's just the surface of this intense movie.I do think the DVD is giving people a false message with the review line from Times, ""At last, a love story for adults.""  Unless an adult love story involves backstabbing and eventual destruction of relationships, this isn't true.  However, I don't think that an ""adult"" relationship necessarily involves the harsh, harsh situations that occur in this movie.  A mature look at relationships, yes.In fact, what I liked most about this movie is the different perspective of love.  Most romantic movies revolve around a person trying to get with another person.  This movie transcends this idea by showing a period of time in the lives of four people.  Not only that, but it shows that love can sometimes be destructive as is evident in the way the movie unfurls.  It's sometimes hard to watch because you get frustrated with how the people act, but I give that as praise because the characters are doing what's in their character.Another interesting thing is that people will flit in and out of the four person story but we really don't pay attention to them.  I can't truly remember any characters besides the four main ones.  And what this does to the story is show that, to these four people, no one else matters.  They are so wrapped up in their game of love/war that nothing else matters, life passes them by.  It's kind of a morality tale in that aspect because it not only shows the destructive ways in which they act but also that they are so caught up in their own lives that they don't notice anyone else.  Very effective.The acting is terrific.  I'm not a fan of Julia Robert's choice in roles usually and was surprised to see her character in this because it's such a change of pace with her usual Runaway Bride/Best Friend's Wedding/Pretty Woman characters.  The dialogue is very explicit and frank in dealing with sex and might offend those not expecting it.  It's not a movie to take little kids to, that's for sure.There's not too much ""physical"" action in the movie.  Because it's based on a play, the action is represented in the dialogue.  What's interesting and sometimes darkly humorous is the verbal warfare that occurs between the characters.  Every scene is a war of wits as each character has an agenda and they use words to get to it.  These situations can become darkly humorous and witty as we see two characters sparring with words.  But this might be a turn off for some because, while there is a threat of violence that lingers between the lines, not too much physical action happens in the movie.There is a song that flits over the opening and closing of the movie and it really is effective in conveying a sadness to the movie.  The song, which I spent a long time trying to find, is ""The Blower's Daughter"" by Damien Rice if anyone is interested.  It's on the cd ""O"" which you can find here.As far as the DVD goes, there's basically nothing besides the movie.  However, the DVD is a superbit edition which has been mastered in high definition with excellent sound which is probably why there isn't many extras since the superbit takes up much more room on a DVD.  But if you have a TV and receiver to run it you will be in for a real treat.I can't recommend this movie enough.  If you are interested in seeing an atypical Hollywood movie about the thing called love and aren't put off by a word heavy movie, then this is an excellent place to look.  It will frustrate you, entertain you, and make you think.",5,A thin line between love and hate,1112140800,"03 30, 2005",2005,3746,"['Closer', 'unique', 'movie', 'not', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'filled', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'Part', 'thrill', 'think', 'people', 'will', 'get', 'film', 'seeing', 'Superstars', 'acting', 'dirty', 'can', 'certainly', 'watch', 'film', 'get', 'thrill', 'just', 'surface', 'intense', 'movie.I', 'do', 'think', 'DVD', 'giving', 'people', 'false', 'message', 'review', 'line', 'Times', 'last', 'love', 'story', 'adults', 'adult', 'love', 'story', 'backstabbing', 'eventual', 'destruction', 'relationships', ""n't"", 'true', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'adult', 'relationship', 'necessarily', 'harsh', 'harsh', 'situations', 'occur', 'movie', 'mature', 'look', 'relationships', 'yes.In', 'fact', 'what', 'liked', 'most', 'movie', 'different', 'perspective', 'love', 'Most', 'romantic', 'movies', 'revolve', 'person', 'trying', 'get', 'person', 'movie', 'idea', 'showing', 'period', 'time', 'lives', 'four', 'people', 'Not', 'only', 'love', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'destructive', 'evident', 'way', 'movie', 'unfurls', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'watch', 'get', 'frustrated', 'how', 'people', 'act', 'give', 'as', 'praise', 'characters', 'are', 'doing', 'what', 'character.Another', 'interesting', 'thing', 'people', 'will', 'flit', 'four', 'person', 'story', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'ca', ""n't"", 'truly', 'remember', 'characters', 'four', 'main', 'ones', 'what', 'story', 'show', 'four', 'people', 'one', 'else', 'matters', 'are', 'so', 'wrapped', 'up', 'game', 'love/war', 'nothing', 'else', 'matters', 'life', 'passes', 'kind', 'morality', 'tale', 'aspect', 'not', 'only', 'destructive', 'ways', 'act', 'also', 'are', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'own', 'lives', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'anyone', 'else', 'Very', 'effective.The', 'acting', 'terrific', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Julia', 'Robert', 'choice', 'roles', 'usually', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'character', 'such', 'change', 'pace', 'usual', 'Runaway', 'Bride/Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding/Pretty', 'Woman', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'very', 'explicit', 'frank', 'dealing', 'sex', 'might', 'offend', 'not', 'expecting', 'not', 'movie', 'take', 'little', 'kids', 'sure.There', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'physical', 'action', 'movie', 'based', 'play', 'action', 'represented', 'dialogue', 'What', 'interesting', 'sometimes', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'verbal', 'warfare', 'characters', 'scene', 'war', 'wits', 'character', 'agenda', 'use', 'words', 'get', 'situations', 'can', 'become', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'witty', 'see', 'two', 'characters', 'sparring', 'words', 'might', 'be', 'turn', 'off', 'threat', 'violence', 'lines', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'physical', 'action', 'movie.There', 'song', 'opening', 'closing', 'movie', 'really', 'effective', 'conveying', 'sadness', 'movie', 'song', 'spent', 'long', 'time', 'trying', 'find', 'Blower', 'Daughter', 'Damien', 'Rice', 'anyone', 'interested', 'cd', 'O', 'can', 'find', 'here.As', 'far', 'DVD', 'basically', 'nothing', 'movie', 'However', 'DVD', 'superbit', 'edition', 'been', 'mastered', 'high', 'definition', 'excellent', 'sound', 'probably', 'why', ""n't"", 'many', 'extras', 'superbit', 'up', 'much', 'more', 'room', 'DVD', 'have', 'TV', 'receiver', 'run', 'will', 'be', 'real', 'treat.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'enough', 'are', 'interested', 'seeing', 'atypical', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'thing', 'called', 'love', 'are', ""n't"", 'put', 'off', 'word', 'heavy', 'movie', 'then', 'excellent', 'place', 'look', 'will', 'frustrate', 'entertain', 'make', 'think']",N/A
884588,ADK5CSMBXHIL8,B0007OCG4W,"T. Halkin ""Tim""","[3, 3]","Playwright Patrick Marber, who adapted his stage play for the large screen, has obviously been very influenced by playwrights the likes of Harold Pinter (think the relationships in ""Betrayal"") and David Mamet (think the staccato scene structure of ""A Life in the Theatre""). Granted, if you're going to be influenced by other writers, then why not two of the best playwrights of our time. Perhaps it is this reason why ""Closer"" has a somewhat less-than-original feeling about it. Then pepper it with a touch of Tom Stoppard's ""The Real Thing"" and you start experiencing d&eacute;j&agrave;-vu.That having been said, is there really anything truly new under the sun?  OK, occasionally - that's what makes a great writer great - but that is extremely rare. So Marber is not setting new benchmarks, but by coupling up with the brilliant Mike Nichols, Marber was able to bring something rather new to the large screen...something that is usually reserved for the relative few who venture out to the theatres of this world - and I don't mean the ones playing the latest Andrew Lloyd Weber musical.So far, I have met no one who ""sort of"" likes this film. Everyone I have spoken to about it either loves it, or hates it. This is quite evident in the reviews that one reads here on Amazon. I, however, am truly in the middle.Getting past my Pinter-Mamet-Stoppard d&eacute;j&agrave;-vu, I was faced with a piece that is much more at home on a theatre stage than it is on a movie screen. The two media normally have very different structures, feelings and pacing. Rarely does it work to adapt a theatre piece for the large screen. The success here was only marginal. The biggest problem with ""Closer"" is it's pacing. Given what the story is trying to achieve, however, there isn't much one could do to improve that, I'm afraid. Put this same piece on a stage, however, and you wouldn't think it slow at all - it's all about the media.Whereas the 4 different relationships, between the 4 characters of this piece constantly ring true, and I can't imagine that anyone will not at times feel like Marber was spying through your keyhole, the truths here are not earth-shaking. You might be engaged for the 104 minutes of the film, feeling at times like you are 14 years old and your mother is waving the dirty magazine she found under your mattress in your face, but this engagement dissolves after the beautiful title song plays out at the end of the film. You don't spend days mulling over this piece like you do after watching, for example, Stoppard's ""Arcadia"".So let me sum up my feelings about Patrick Marber: a good solid writer for the stage, who deserves to have his pieces produced, but might not leave that big a mark as a legacy unless he can find a more unique style and finds truths to tell that are more earth-shaking than ""we're all dirty, rotten liars deep down inside"".There is a major upside to ""Closer"" and that lies in the magnificent cast. Roberts, Law, Owen and Portman give their best performances to date in this film. Natalie Portman steals a show, however, that is damn near impossible to steal. You won't be able to take your eyes off of her. She absolutely lights up the screen. If there is no other reason to see this film, then is it for her brilliant performance.

884589,A2I29YY8T7PVLZ,B0007OCG4W,the_frog,"[6, 11]","I watched this movie on the recommendation of the wealth of positive reviews about this film, and, in the end, found myself wanting a lot more.In the plus column, the movie is largely extremely well-acted. Natalie Portman shows why she was considered one of the brightest acting talents before doing a regrettable trilogy for an absolute tourniquet of a director in George Lucas. Her character radiates charisma, sexiness, and vulnerability through a tough exterior. This is an absolute standout performance. Jude Law's Dan takes the greatest arc of any of the characters in the movie. Clive Owen has garnered a lot of attention for his ferocious portrayal,  though I am not as impressed here, as his character seems inconsistent. Julia Roberts, among this cast, seems comparatively wooden, but she diserves credit for not being caught up in some of the over-acting that threatened to taint a lot of the scenes.But the movie is driven entirely by the four main characters, and none of them establish themselves as likeable, or even central. As you might have gathered from above, Alice (Portman) is the most immediately likeable, but even much of her charm is undone at the end of the movie. Essentially, this has the effect of pushing the viewer away, which makes it difficult to watch the movie. The lack of identification with chracters makes it even harder to understand their motivations. In fact, a lot of their actions veer into the ""unfathomable"" range, which, to me, is really the movie's undoing. ""Closer"" unflinchingly shows the horrible things that people can do to each other in a relationship, but never provides an understanding as to WHY, which makes it more voyeuristic than artistic.In many ways, I can see why people review the film positively, because the craft of this movie is impressive. The movie is beautifully shot, and scenes are brilliantly framed. Law and Owens's long dialogue in the doctor's office, with the site of the latest infidelity looming quietly in the background, seems to reflect the unending spectre of guilt hanging over all the charcters. That said there are two criticisms of how the film was made. Firstly, the passage of time is very unclear, and when the dialogue attempts to announce that (e.g. ""We've been having an affair for a year."") it comes off more a lie by the character than exposition. Characters get married without a hint to the audience. Secondly, the nudity clauses in the actors contracts are painfully on display here, largely centered around Natalie Portman being the ONLY stripper in the club not shown, and the movie being carefully edited to avoid showing anything. This is not because I have any particular interest in seeing her naked, but because the fact that she COULDN'T be filmed nude altered the natural portrayal of a scene enough to break suspension of disbelief (of course, with a different line of employment for her character, this is not an issue, but that would disrupt much of the film's plot). Of course, these are really quibbles, compared to quality of the work as a whole.As well-crafted as this movie is, as rich in talent as it is, at the end of the day, I did not enjoy this movie, and found myself unable to reconcile the characters and their actions. As unlikeable a group as they are, to compound this with incomprehensiblity really turns me off, and, in addition to not enjoying the movie, I found myself unable to appreciate it. Ultimately, no matter how well-done the film was, these faults prevent me from rating it any higher than I have.",2,A wealth of talent...for what?,1133654400,"12 4, 2005",2005,3539,"['watched', 'movie', 'recommendation', 'wealth', 'positive', 'reviews', 'film', 'end', 'found', 'wanting', 'lot', 'plus', 'column', 'movie', 'largely', 'extremely', 'well-acted', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'why', 'was', 'considered', 'one', 'brightest', 'acting', 'talents', 'doing', 'regrettable', 'trilogy', 'absolute', 'tourniquet', 'director', 'George', 'Lucas', 'character', 'charisma', 'sexiness', 'vulnerability', 'tough', 'exterior', 'absolute', 'standout', 'performance', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Dan', 'greatest', 'arc', 'characters', 'movie', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'garnered', 'lot', 'attention', 'ferocious', 'portrayal', 'am', 'not', 'impressed', 'here', 'character', 'inconsistent', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'cast', 'comparatively', 'wooden', 'credit', 'not', 'being', 'caught', 'up', 'over-acting', 'threatened', 'taint', 'lot', 'scenes.But', 'movie', 'driven', 'entirely', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'none', 'establish', 'likeable', 'even', 'central', 'might', 'have', 'gathered', 'Alice', 'Portman', 'most', 'immediately', 'likeable', 'even', 'much', 'charm', 'undone', 'end', 'movie', 'Essentially', 'effect', 'pushing', 'viewer', 'away', 'difficult', 'watch', 'movie', 'lack', 'identification', 'chracters', 'even', 'harder', 'understand', 'motivations', 'fact', 'lot', 'actions', 'veer', 'unfathomable', 'range', 'really', 'movie', 'undoing', 'Closer', 'unflinchingly', 'horrible', 'things', 'people', 'can', 'do', 'other', 'relationship', 'never', 'understanding', 'WHY', 'more', 'voyeuristic', 'artistic.In', 'many', 'ways', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'review', 'film', 'positively', 'craft', 'movie', 'impressive', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'scenes', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'framed', 'Law', 'Owens', 'long', 'dialogue', 'doctor', 'office', 'site', 'latest', 'infidelity', 'looming', 'quietly', 'background', 'reflect', 'unending', 'spectre', 'guilt', 'hanging', 'charcters', 'said', 'are', 'two', 'criticisms', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Firstly', 'passage', 'time', 'very', 'unclear', 'when', 'dialogue', 'announce', 'e.g', ""'ve"", 'been', 'having', 'affair', 'year', 'off', 'more', 'lie', 'character', 'exposition', 'Characters', 'get', 'married', 'hint', 'audience', 'Secondly', 'nudity', 'actors', 'contracts', 'are', 'painfully', 'display', 'here', 'largely', 'centered', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'being', 'ONLY', 'stripper', 'club', 'not', 'shown', 'movie', 'being', 'carefully', 'edited', 'avoid', 'showing', 'anything', 'not', 'have', 'particular', 'interest', 'seeing', 'naked', 'fact', 'COULD', ""N'T"", 'be', 'filmed', 'nude', 'altered', 'natural', 'portrayal', 'scene', 'enough', 'break', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'course', 'different', 'line', 'employment', 'character', 'not', 'issue', 'would', 'disrupt', 'much', 'film', 'plot', 'course', 'are', 'really', 'quibbles', 'compared', 'quality', 'work', 'whole.As', 'well-crafted', 'movie', 'rich', 'talent', 'end', 'day', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'found', 'unable', 'reconcile', 'characters', 'actions', 'unlikeable', 'group', 'are', 'compound', 'incomprehensiblity', 'really', 'off', 'addition', 'not', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'found', 'unable', 'appreciate', 'Ultimately', 'matter', 'how', 'well-done', 'film', 'was', 'faults', 'prevent', 'rating', 'higher', 'have']",N/A

Firstly, I am glad that I rented the movie and did not see it on theatre. It shows the life of 4 people who are drawn in different directions. Granted that life is never straight, but I never thought that it was this distraught. Maybe I was wrong. It has a big cast, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Clive Owens and Julia Roberts. I for one think that Julia Roberts and Jude Law were totally wrong for the movie and were reciting their lines. In fact, I think that Jude Law is way overrated. I cannot think of a single movie where he was spectacular. After this movie, he should retire. Natalie Portman was not bad, but Clive Owens was the only one showing real human emotions. The movie is replete with bad language, adultery and lying to each other without any obvious reason. While Patrick Marber's stage play was terrific, the movie was terrible. If the director wanted to bring out the irony behind love, he did a shoddy job of it. I will not go into the story, there are enough reviewers who have done so. Life is bad enough as it is, without a movie taking all the ironies to the extreme and portraying it in a dull, stupid way. All I can say after this movie is that, I am glad that I am not into internet chat rooms and my respect for some actors and the director have gone down tremendously.

884593,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B0007OCG4W,Tom Benton,"[9, 11]","Let me begin by saying that ""Closer"" is the kind of film that you've gotta see for yourself to decide if you like it. Half the time I see reviews by people who loved the film, and half the time I see reviews by people who absolutely despised it. I, myself, loved it.""Closer"" is the story of four individuals: obituary writer and struggling author Dan (Jude Law), waitress and ex-stripper Alice (Natalie Portman), popular photographer Anna (Julia Roberts) and dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen). Dan and Alice meet in London after Alice is hit by a car. A few months later, Dan is being photographed for his novel by Anna, and the two fall in love - but only Dan will admit it. Trying to get back at Anna, he pretends to be her on an Internet sex chat and tells Larry to meet her at an aquarium for sex. By chance, the real Anna is at the aquarium; she meets Larry and the two fall in love.Eventually, Alice leaves Dan and Anna leaves Larry. By the end of the film, each man has had sex with each woman and vice versa; they seem to love whomever they're with, but in reality they only love their original partner.I'd heard good things about this film before watching it, but after watching it the first time I was disappointed. While it was no doubt a fine film, there was more sexual dialog than I could have ever imagined! Now I can tolerate sexuality in a movie just as much as the next guy, but when the film becomes unrealistically sexual than I become fed up with it. And ""Closer"" seemed to be just that. But now, having watched the movie numerous more times, I realize that the film is abnormally sexual, but not necessarily overly sexual. Would it have been better without so much sexuality? Yes. But the rest of the film makes up for it. Oh yes, does it ever.Patrick Marber's script is adapted from Marber's popular, award-winning play. The script is witty, intelligent and original. There are some great lines, which come from characters who seem very real.The acting is one of the film's high points. Jude Law is terrific as Dan, who tries to be mean but just can't pull it off. He makes the character a target for sympathy from the audience. Natalie Portman is, as always, very good, as Alice. Julia Roberts, while good, doesn't give the best performance of her career; it feels like she's not putting in a huge amount of effort. Clive Owen is outstanding as always; Owen's performance has made Larry my favorite character in the film. He really brings out the bad side of Larry, but he's likable at the same time. There's a certain air of mysticism around Larry, like you never know what he's going to do next. Interestingly, Owen played Law's part in the original stage play.Mike Nichols proves that his directorial talent hasn't faded one bit since he made the 1967 classic ""The Graduate"" - in fact, Nichols seems better than ever. He gives the film a cold, hard feeling, but at times he seems to loosen up - much like the characters themselves. He really captures the darkness of Patrick Marber's script.The few songs on the soundtrack are excellent, but the one that really stands out is ""The Blower's Daughter"" by Damien Rice. It's used for the film's theme, and there isn't another song in the world that is so perfect for this movie as ""Blower's Daughter"". The song is absolutely beautiful; the sad, determined strength found in the lyrics matches the film well.""Closer"" is closer to perfection than any romantic-drama has ever come. If you're looking for a soft romance like ""Sleepless in Seattle"" or ""Notting Hill"", then this is probably not the movie for you. This is a mature, dark, grim look at romance, and I love it. ""Closer"" has become one of my favorite films. If you feel like watching the film and deciding for yourself how you feel, and you keep an open mind, then I applaud you.",5,Closer to perfection than any romantic-drama has ever come,1119398400,"06 22, 2005",2005,3808,"['Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'Closer', 'kind', 'film', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'see', 'decide', 'like', 'time', 'see', 'reviews', 'people', 'who', 'loved', 'film', 'time', 'see', 'reviews', 'people', 'who', 'absolutely', 'despised', 'loved', 'Closer', 'story', 'four', 'individuals', 'obituary', 'writer', 'struggling', 'author', 'Dan', 'Jude', 'Law', 'waitress', 'ex-stripper', 'Alice', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'popular', 'photographer', 'Anna', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'dermatologist', 'Larry', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Dan', 'Alice', 'meet', 'London', 'Alice', 'hit', 'car', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'Dan', 'being', 'photographed', 'novel', 'Anna', 'two', 'fall', 'love', 'only', 'Dan', 'will', 'admit', 'Trying', 'get', 'back', 'Anna', 'be', 'Internet', 'sex', 'chat', 'tells', 'Larry', 'meet', 'aquarium', 'sex', 'chance', 'real', 'Anna', 'aquarium', 'Larry', 'two', 'fall', 'love.Eventually', 'Alice', 'Dan', 'Anna', 'Larry', 'end', 'film', 'man', 'had', 'sex', 'woman', 'vice', 'versa', 'seem', 'love', 'whomever', ""'re"", 'reality', 'only', 'love', 'original', 'partner.I', ""'d"", 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'watching', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', 'doubt', 'fine', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'sexual', 'dialog', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'imagined', 'Now', 'can', 'tolerate', 'sexuality', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'guy', 'when', 'film', 'unrealistically', 'sexual', 'become', 'fed', 'up', 'Closer', 'seemed', 'be', 'just', 'now', 'having', 'watched', 'movie', 'numerous', 'more', 'times', 'realize', 'film', 'abnormally', 'sexual', 'not', 'necessarily', 'overly', 'sexual', 'Would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'so', 'much', 'sexuality', 'Yes', 'rest', 'film', 'up', 'Oh', 'yes', 'ever.Patrick', 'Marber', 'script', 'adapted', 'Marber', 'popular', 'award-winning', 'play', 'script', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'original', 'are', 'great', 'lines', 'come', 'characters', 'who', 'seem', 'very', 'real.The', 'acting', 'one', 'film', 'high', 'points', 'Jude', 'Law', 'terrific', 'Dan', 'who', 'be', 'mean', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'character', 'target', 'sympathy', 'audience', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'always', 'very', 'good', 'Alice', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'good', ""n't"", 'give', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'not', 'putting', 'huge', 'amount', 'effort', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'outstanding', 'always', 'Owen', 'performance', 'made', 'Larry', 'favorite', 'character', 'film', 'really', 'out', 'bad', 'side', 'Larry', 'likable', 'same', 'time', 'certain', 'air', 'mysticism', 'Larry', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'next', 'Interestingly', 'Owen', 'played', 'Law', 'part', 'original', 'stage', 'play.Mike', 'Nichols', 'directorial', 'talent', ""n't"", 'faded', 'one', 'bit', 'made', '1967', 'classic', 'Graduate', 'fact', 'Nichols', 'better', 'ever', 'film', 'cold', 'hard', 'feeling', 'times', 'loosen', 'up', 'much', 'characters', 'really', 'darkness', 'Patrick', 'Marber', 'script.The', 'few', 'songs', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'excellent', 'one', 'really', 'out', 'Blower', 'Daughter', 'Damien', 'Rice', 'used', 'film', 'theme', ""n't"", 'song', 'world', 'so', 'perfect', 'movie', 'Blower', 'Daughter', 'song', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'sad', 'determined', 'strength', 'found', 'lyrics', 'film', 'well', 'Closer', 'closer', 'perfection', 'romantic-drama', 'ever', 'come', ""'re"", 'looking', 'soft', 'romance', 'Sleepless', 'Seattle', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'then', 'probably', 'not', 'movie', 'mature', 'dark', 'grim', 'look', 'romance', 'love', 'Closer', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'feel', 'watching', 'film', 'deciding', 'how', 'feel', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'then', 'applaud']",N/A

But I thought the sheer nastiness to the nth degree that all the characters indulged in(some more effectively than others) was quite entertaining.Clive Owens character steals the show because his character is the least squeamish and the most ruthless and clever of all of them. He also delivers the best lines that make you want to press the rewind button repeatedly. It isn't often my husband and I are BOTH impressed with a particular actor in a movie.Part of the entertainment comes from watching these little weasels act up, and part of the entertainment comes from the fact that we've all done some pretty crappy, manipulative, and underhanded things to the ones we ""love"" to-because we could.I don't find this movie profound or high art or some dramatic study on love really. I thought it had a very biting, dark humor-my husband and I were laughing much more than sitting silent and sadly. I mean, watching Jude Law cry like a little girl was hilarious after everything he had done to everyone else. I thought the most interesting thing was how in many ways these two men-Law as an equal parts dreamy, disloyal, and selfish charmer and Owen as the ultimate alpha-male-were motivated to do things for or in reaction to eachother and the women in some ways were just a means to an end...(I think the women, especially Roberts, were much more elusive in nature as to their motivations). Just a devilish little movie with knockout acting, oh-no-she-didn't-oh-yes-she-did setups, and some lines that really make you laugh out lough(ie-Owen meeting Law for the first time, sizing him up, and saying, ""he's a stringy little f......."")....",4,It's a rubbernecking trainwreck-Owen makes the movie,1112313600,"04 1, 2005",2005,1989,"['get', 'critiques', 'movie', 'outlandish', 'full', 'coincidences', 'who', 'cares-I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'rent', 'movie', 'regular', 'life', 'carpooling', 'grocery', 'shopping', 'working', 'parenting', 'Give', 'romantic', 'equivalent', '40', 'car', 'pile-up', 'motivations', 'actions', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'jive', 'times', 'thought', 'sheer', 'nastiness', 'nth', 'degree', 'characters', 'indulged', 'more', 'effectively', 'others', 'was', 'quite', 'entertaining.Clive', 'Owens', 'character', 'show', 'character', 'least', 'squeamish', 'most', 'ruthless', 'clever', 'also', 'best', 'lines', 'make', 'want', 'press', 'rewind', 'button', 'repeatedly', ""n't"", 'often', 'husband', 'are', 'impressed', 'particular', 'actor', 'movie.Part', 'entertainment', 'watching', 'little', 'weasels', 'act', 'up', 'part', 'entertainment', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'done', 'pretty', 'crappy', 'manipulative', 'underhanded', 'things', 'ones', 'love', 'to-because', 'could.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'movie', 'profound', 'high', 'art', 'dramatic', 'study', 'love', 'really', 'thought', 'had', 'very', 'biting', 'dark', 'humor-my', 'husband', 'were', 'laughing', 'much', 'more', 'sitting', 'silent', 'sadly', 'mean', 'watching', 'Jude', 'Law', 'cry', 'little', 'girl', 'was', 'hilarious', 'everything', 'had', 'done', 'everyone', 'else', 'thought', 'most', 'interesting', 'thing', 'was', 'how', 'many', 'ways', 'two', 'men-Law', 'equal', 'parts', 'dreamy', 'disloyal', 'selfish', 'charmer', 'Owen', 'ultimate', 'alpha-male-were', 'motivated', 'do', 'things', 'reaction', 'eachother', 'women', 'ways', 'were', 'just', 'means', 'end', 'think', 'women', 'especially', 'Roberts', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'elusive', 'nature', 'motivations', 'Just', 'devilish', 'little', 'movie', 'knockout', 'acting', ""oh-no-she-didn't-oh-yes-she-did"", 'setups', 'lines', 'really', 'make', 'lough', 'ie-Owen', 'meeting', 'Law', 'first', 'time', 'sizing', 'up', 'saying', 'stringy', 'little', 'f']",N/A

Four persons each had their own agenda of what a relationship should be intertwined by fate and sadness to form the story of Closer. They were drawn closer together by each other but at the same time build up distances among themselves.Closer is an adaptation from a stage play, which in a way could explain its wordiness and lack of huge dramatic action for most cinema audiences. After all a play about relationship could not offer too much of physical tension unless it is about relationship abuses. Jude Law, Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman and Clive Owen (of which the latter two earned their Golden Globe titles in 2005) formed the quartet of the cast and provided a subtle but brilliant performance. Jude as Daniel was a grown up boy looking for the mysteries behind relationship but at the same time could not handle any truth uncovered by his curiosity and Sherlock Holmish behaviours. Julia was the photographer who looked for trust and honesty which she herself found it difficult to offer. Clive Owen looked for the rawness and honesty that he treasured in all relationships, short or long. Natalie Portman looks beyond the surface truth and simply looked for love that she could offer and receive. Needless to say, with such a different agenda for each person, tensions were built all over the place when fate put them together.The whole cast gave a very likeable performance with a good degree of naturalism and showed a huge amount of maturity in their roles. There was only one scene for each boy to boy and girl to girl conversation, but they well portrayed that even between people with the same gender, things don't necessarily go smooth. They might share similar instincts on certain issues and hints, but after all they are individuals who would react different to the same situation that they were drawn into.The movie is very wordy and most of the information and flow comes from different dialogues. It could be very annoying for people who are just look for a light romance drama to pass their time. Nonetheless, if you pay attention to what is being written and delivered by the actors, there are gems lying all over the place. The movie started off comparatively light but as it went on, the tone went heavier and heavier. This could be another turn off for a lot of audiences too. Closer is not something for you to look for if you are looking for something bright and relaxing, but would surely serve you well if you are looking for a real relationship drama movie. Also although, it is about relationship, there is no graphic sex (apart from Natalie Portman's dancing) throughout the whole movie. The language is sexually coarse at a lot of places, but if you are looking for butt naked scenes of any of the actors, you will definitely be disappointed. There haven't been similar type of relationship drama around for a while but if you are a person looking for a good scripts that lay the wisdoms in its lines, then Closer will be a movie you would enjoy. Otherwise, it could be too heavy or might even cause you a headache following the events.",4,"Nothing too dramatic, nothing too mainstream, but well done",1106956800,"01 29, 2005",2005,3131,"['Closer', 'tension', 'labour', 'relationships', 'Four', 'persons', 'had', 'own', 'agenda', 'what', 'relationship', 'should', 'be', 'intertwined', 'fate', 'sadness', 'form', 'story', 'Closer', 'were', 'drawn', 'closer', 'together', 'other', 'same', 'time', 'build', 'up', 'distances', 'themselves.Closer', 'adaptation', 'stage', 'play', 'way', 'could', 'explain', 'wordiness', 'lack', 'huge', 'dramatic', 'action', 'most', 'cinema', 'audiences', 'play', 'relationship', 'could', 'not', 'offer', 'too', 'much', 'physical', 'tension', 'relationship', 'abuses', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'latter', 'two', 'earned', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'titles', '2005', 'formed', 'quartet', 'cast', 'provided', 'subtle', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Jude', 'Daniel', 'was', 'grown', 'up', 'boy', 'looking', 'mysteries', 'relationship', 'same', 'time', 'could', 'not', 'handle', 'truth', 'uncovered', 'curiosity', 'Sherlock', 'Holmish', 'behaviours', 'Julia', 'was', 'photographer', 'who', 'looked', 'trust', 'honesty', 'found', 'difficult', 'offer', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'looked', 'rawness', 'honesty', 'treasured', 'relationships', 'short', 'long', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'surface', 'truth', 'simply', 'looked', 'love', 'could', 'offer', 'receive', 'Needless', 'say', 'different', 'agenda', 'person', 'tensions', 'were', 'built', 'place', 'when', 'fate', 'put', 'together.The', 'whole', 'cast', 'gave', 'very', 'likeable', 'performance', 'good', 'degree', 'naturalism', 'showed', 'huge', 'amount', 'maturity', 'roles', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'boy', 'boy', 'girl', 'girl', 'conversation', 'well', 'portrayed', 'even', 'people', 'same', 'gender', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'go', 'smooth', 'might', 'share', 'similar', 'instincts', 'certain', 'issues', 'hints', 'are', 'individuals', 'who', 'would', 'react', 'different', 'same', 'situation', 'were', 'drawn', 'into.The', 'movie', 'very', 'wordy', 'most', 'information', 'flow', 'different', 'dialogues', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'annoying', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'look', 'light', 'romance', 'drama', 'pass', 'time', 'Nonetheless', 'pay', 'attention', 'what', 'being', 'written', 'delivered', 'actors', 'are', 'gems', 'lying', 'place', 'movie', 'started', 'off', 'comparatively', 'light', 'went', 'tone', 'went', 'heavier', 'heavier', 'could', 'be', 'turn', 'off', 'lot', 'audiences', 'too', 'Closer', 'not', 'something', 'look', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'bright', 'relaxing', 'would', 'surely', 'serve', 'well', 'are', 'looking', 'real', 'relationship', 'drama', 'movie', 'Also', 'relationship', 'graphic', 'sex', 'apart', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'dancing', 'whole', 'movie', 'language', 'sexually', 'coarse', 'lot', 'places', 'are', 'looking', 'butt', 'naked', 'scenes', 'actors', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'similar', 'type', 'relationship', 'drama', 'while', 'are', 'person', 'looking', 'good', 'scripts', 'lay', 'wisdoms', 'lines', 'then', 'Closer', 'will', 'be', 'movie', 'would', 'enjoy', 'Otherwise', 'could', 'be', 'too', 'heavy', 'might', 'even', 'cause', 'headache', 'following', 'events']",N/A

That's 'Closer,' film about the four characters you don't care, who keep doing horrible things to each other in the name of love.There's not much of a story.  This is about four characters -- played by Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen.  Jude encouners Natalie on the street of London, and they fall in love with each other, but Jude finds himself attracted to Julia during a photo session with her.  In the meanwhile, Clive also gets acquainted with Julia, and married her, but later finds she is in love with Jude, who in turn ... should I continue?[AWFULLY STAGY] The film is based on a stage production, and it shows.  The film repeatedly shows the beginning or the end part of the relation(s) between the characters, and when one of the  characters leaves another, their dialogues suggest what happenned to him/her before that scene.  It is not surprising that Mike Nichols, who is also known as accomplished stage director, found this material interesting.  But I for one found otherwise.For, on the big screen, the contrived situations as to their meeting and parting are simply impossible.  See how Clive Owen's doctor come to meet Julia Roberts.  Clive's doc is seen chatting with Jude Law over the internet.  Clive (quite ignorantly) believes Jude is a female, and makes a promise with 'her' to meet.  Ironically, Jude's prank ends up with Clive's seeing with Julia (yet a stranger to Clive, remember that), for whom poor Jude has already fell.  On stage, it works.  On screen, it's just laughable.Of course, you can defend the whole things saying this kind of  contrivance is necessary, and should be forgotten during the film which explores the nature of love.  Right, but the idea of love in 'Closer' means sleeping with someone else, and confessing the secret in the most off-putting way, often using many dirty and graphic words spoken by Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman, real guilty pleasure.OK, people act like that, I admit, and I know.  But as I remember, we are not so much intent on manipulating the relations and hurting the ones we love as those characters, whose pathetic behaviors just made me sick.  And though Natalie Portman and Clive Owen won the Golden Globe Awards, I find nothing special in their acting, and think miscast Portman is too young for the role of a striptease dancer.The characters are at best the puppets poorly handled by the stagy script, and the acting does not help.

884599,ASJ89T42CIUHU,B0007OCG4W,V. Marshall,"[7, 14]","This film lacks just about everything except great actors. It is worth seeing, maybe once at best.Anna (Julia Roberts) is a married photographer who meets her husband, Larry (Clive Owen) through a twist of fate porno site set up. She crosses paths with a writer, Dan (Jude Law) when she photographs him for his book cover but Dan is somehow involved with a young stripper/waitress (Natalie Portman). Inevitably when lies are told lives are fowled up and these characters really make a mess of things.With a great director like Mike Nichols at the helm of this movie one would think it would all work. However I felt it lacked depth of any kind. The characters are cruel and passionless despite being obsessed with sex 24 hours a day. Clive Owen is downright creepy in his role as a doctor who frequents porn sites for a thrill.....is he such a crappy doctor that he has that much time to kill? Julia Robert's character is more like his possession than a wife and her role seems to have no purpose whatsoever. It is never explained why a seemingly beautiful and successful woman would agree to marry a freak who believes he met her in a porno site chat room....any self-respecting woman would question that even if he were a doctor with a Mercedes! So there is definitely something deeper in there but it is never made clear and soon becomes absolutely frustrating. Jude Law's role is jealous and obsessive and would have made sense had he treated Portman's character with a bit more respect. And finally Portman is a bit over her naive head here pretending to be raw and racy while projecting far too much fear, she is a great actor but this role took something away from her.I'm not sure exactly where this film really fails, the writing, the directing or the subject matter. I think it would have worked had more attention been paid to the reasoning behind the flawed characters and their decision making processes.

It's also a movie about 2 couples dealing with infidelity. I must say I enjoyed We Don't Live Anymore only because Laura Dern delivered another ""career best"" performance. Closer is better story, direction is fine, and the all star cast is superb, especially the never been better Natalie Portman playing a striper. She's gone beyond her other good works including Anywhere But Here and Where The Heart Is.Alice(Portman) met Dan(Jude Law) on the street of London when she got hit by a car, and they instantly became an ""item"". Dan has a thing for Anna(Julia Roberts), a photograper who likes to shoot strangers at the London Aquarium. She rejects Dan, because he's already with Alice. He uses her name and e-chat with a cyber sex freak/doctor named Larry(Clive Owen), and set up a date with him at the aquarium. Anna happens to be there when the horny doctor showed up. It was actually Anna's birthday, and depite the fact that she knew it was Dan who set the date up, she instantly clicked with Larry, and they also became an ""item"".Time goes by, and passion fades, one member of the couples falls out of love. Anna secretly screw around with Dan after getting married with Larry. Dan decided to dump Alice, because she's not good enough or not woman enough to stimulate him. Alice was devastated and took off. Anna eventually  had to tell Larry her secret, because she couldn't stay with him anymore. Larry agreed to get divorced if she would let him ""indulge"" her body one more time.Larry accidently ran into Alice in the strip joint and he paid her lots of money to have her strip for him and wanted to take her home and love her...Upon knowing that Anna had slept with Larry again, Dan was furious and wanted to dump her, despite the fact that she love him more than Larry. Anyways, who will stay with whom at the end, I will not spoil it for you.The overexposed Jude Law's character is the least likeable in this film, and somehow his performance is not as convincing like the way Portman(Alice) thinks of his love for her. Maybe it's the immaturity and insecurity of his role that makes me feel that way.Clive Owen is pretty good, even though he has less screen time. He's more likeable compared to Law, because he's character is more realistic and honest.This is probably Julia Robert's most serious role since Erin Brockovich.

884603,A3IF373S0789NA,B0007OCG4W,x_bruce,"[6, 8]","I saw the trailer, thought it was interesting, took a chance due to the director and cast. What I saw was a adult story about people doing stupid things in the name of love.I probably saw a different film from a lot of people but I could identify with the characters. Thankfully, I wasn't as stupid or outright ugly as these (I think, intentionally beautiful) people, but I did do some stupid things at various ages as represented here, and while I'm older than all the characters in the film, I identified with a lot of friends, ex-friends, etc. who lived their lives in a series of lies about themseles, their relationships and what happiness was.In this sense Close is an adult film with some excellent writing by it's screenwriter/playwrite. The characers in general aren't all that loveable, but they aren't dispicable; just human.Mike Nichols has been down this path before, particularly in ""Carnal Knowledge"", but also throughout his career.What it comes down to is whether these characters are at all sympathetic to you, or even believeable. Perhaps it was the kind of lifestyle I lead or the people I knew, but life is full of dumb decisions and implausable reasoning. Call this adults behaving badly, or perhpas, three adults, a stunted growth damaged girl (Portnoy), a depressive (Roberts in a nice change of pace) and men being men. I know, I'm a man.It seems like a good amount of people wanted a beautiful story rather than stunted growth between the sexes. The film was shot with a clinical vs warm fascade that represented the ""warm characters"" although as we see through the film, even the nicest guy in the film is SOB when he wants to be and his vengence is cruel, even if he's still nice enough to help his nemesis.Taken from a more adult perspective, he's just increasing his odds of making his relationship work out better. People aren't nice in Closer, nor are the pure evil. In fact, the least likeable character for me ended up getting some questionable pity from me.The acting is excellent, that's why it got considerations, not because of the big name cast, because there was a script of extremely well written prose being acted effectively by the actors and stewarded by Mike Nichols.This isn't typically a film I'd bother with, but I'm glad I saw it. All I can say is depending who you are, what you've experienced and whether you have spent enough time on this earth to have spent time with people like this, will help to some degree whether you like this film.Forget it if you need action and adventure, this is a nicely told story that happens over years of time and does so using smart writing and film editing and director's work. I think a lot of people who found this not unrealistic or unsympathetic or any of the given reasons why people hate this perfectly fine film. Of course there are the sartorial, look at me, I'm sartorial! types here that find the film shallow or decadent or whatever. Guess what, there are shallow, decadent or whatever people in this world and some of them may become someone you love or find beautiful.Woody Allen's ""Anything Else"" had a somewhat similar outlook but was funny and had similarly nice performances by it's cast, particularly an older Allen as a nutball acting his age. But if anyone wants to look at odd, beautiful people, have a look at Allen's playbook of lovers and his questionable decisions that were not incest but were the next best thing.He's intellectually interesting to women, ask some people who saw films by him when he was in his 30s and 40s. They all had a crush on the nebbish commedian with loveable faults.Maybe that would have been an interesting way of playing the film, but it probably wouldn't have gotten made or gotten an audience. I actually liked the theme of moderate to extrememly damaged humans that were close to each other and very much perfect in cultural eyes, but maybe I'm reading more depth into Closer than was intended, though I don't think so.A good quality, well written and acted film adult film is made and somehow that's a terrible thing to some here. To people that enjoy film as much as reading, I think you'll enjoy the prose and the decently fleshed out characters found in Closer. Maybe I'm rating this a 5 out of spite to those that made it out to be terrible. I'd say it's a solid 4+ film, maybe a 4.5. See this if you haven't seen adult themes missing the actual themes claimed to be in the film. This one has the goods and is worth your support.The DVD is lacking in extras and you may want to hold off for the Collectors, Special, Ultra Close edition that does have good extras, but those that feel they might have ""gotten it"" or liked the film better if only the director and or cast spoke about the film, I'd say, that's nice but I buy a dvd for the film, not the features.I like them, but I'm pefectly happy a well crafted film as is. Maybe you will too. This is a film that depends on the ability to get into the character's heads wich is admittedly  difficult at times, but it is worth the effort and I hope more people give this good film a chance.",5,"Glad I didn't read the ""reviews""",1127001600,"09 18, 2005",2005,5088,"['saw', 'trailer', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'took', 'chance', 'due', 'director', 'cast', 'What', 'saw',

There was so much penned up rage throughout the entire film I thought that at least one of the neurotic characters would find themselves commiting a felony assault or at least end up on the slab.  ""Closer"" built itself up to be a ""thriller"" type movie but ended up trying to pass itself off as an edgy, thought provocing chick flick.  I was hoping one of them would, well you know, end up on the slab because in reality they all deserved it.  All four of them were creepy pretentious losers and were just askin' for it.  The film did have me goin' for a while but when it ended, I felt like I was the one being cheated on.  Not to say getting revenge and violence is the answer, but it's a movie and that's what I wanted to see.  Out of the four of them you really didn't know who, at certain points was going to suffer royaly for....(gasp).........adultery!!!!  Who hasn't had their heart broken? How dramatic.  It would have been more dramatic if at least one of them got thrown off a balcony at least.  They should have capitalized on the mystery aspect and surprised everyone.  Out of the four I really think they shoud have killed off Clive Owen's character, he was so annoying.  There were so many angles to this film that could have been exploited, but they chose to be moralistic and give it a happy feel good ending.
