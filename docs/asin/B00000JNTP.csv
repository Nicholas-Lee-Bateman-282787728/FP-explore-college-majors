507086,A3B97VI1KMKRL2,B00000JNTP,Amazon Customer,"[5, 5]","I see that i dont stand alone when i say that Sailor Moon SuperS the movie was not exactly what people had hoped for.  After Sailor Moon R all fans had high hopes for the following movies.  While hearts in ice filled the expectations of viewers, SuperS left fans a bit dissapointed.  Perhaps it is due to the inconsistancy it has when it comes to the actual series or maybe it is because the story line has left much to be desired. Im not exaclty sure, but what i am sure about is that having been a long time sailor mooon fan and own and seen every episode made, SuperS just does not live up to the standard.You're probably wondering then why i gave this movie four stars then...well even tho it is not the best sailor moon movie....it is still good to watch and kill time.  Plus it still has its moments which help to redeme it some in my eyes.  The best scene in the film is right after sailor moon breaks free of the dream box and must carry chibi-moon out of the black dream hole.  She starts being assalted by fire that quickly starts to sap her strength....she then calls on the power of the other senshi and after gaining their strength she is able to bust through the fire and out of the dream hole.Now, the part i did not like was the whole thing with the outer senshi, Neptune, Uranus, and Pluto, coming back.  The whole thing doesnt make sense because those senshi dont come back till the fifth season Stars.  If you have watched Stars you will realize quickly that when they come back it is the first time, not the second like the movie would suggest.  So, the whole thing doesnt quite fit in with how the series was put together which can get confusing.  If their going to make a movie with the return of the outer senshi, then they should at least make it so it fits in with the series first. (plus it would have been great if sailor saturn was in it too!) But aside from the fact that their coming back does not fit the series, they make a great contribution to the film and make it worth watching which is more than likely part of the reason for bringing them into the film.  Its great to see the outer senshi again and their entrance during the film rises the susopension a bit and makes you shout a hurrah! for sailor moon.What i find somewhat humerous in this movie is that once again, chibi-usa falls in love with someone she can never be with.  While there may be hope for her and Helios, there is none with Mamoru or Paperu (i think thats how it is spelled). She tends to always like the ones she cant be with.  Like the whole love thing with Mamoru is sooooo wrong that it makes me sick whenever is see her fawning over him.  She knows that he is her father....so why in the hell is she trying to come between Usagi and him sometimes? EW! If i were usagi, i would tell chibi-usa that she would become celebate so she wont exist if she doesnt keep her paws off Mamoru....heheh....that should get her.  But the whole love thing between her and paperu i must say is cute since they are little kids.....ahhhh...young love...hehehe....too bad they dont know about they REAL good parts of love yet. ^_^Well, if your a big sailor moon fan like myself i would urge you to get this film so you may watch it and add it to your sailor moon horde.  Its not a bad movie its just not the best either.  The story line is fun and i definitly love the music in it, thats for sure.  I urge you, like in all the films, to NOT watch the english version...it is down right horrible.  At times the voices are just annoying and the voice acting is just poor....i havent seen an anime yet where the voice acting was good....i wish that the producers would stop half assing the voice overs...because if they are just going to do crap like what is in this film then they might as well just keep it subtitled.  But of course it is good for your little kids because they dont know good acting yet plus any parts you might see unsutable for your kids have been cut out, like when usagi spanks chibi-usa (which i dont exaclty get why it was cut but oh well)....but the japanese version is uncut an made for those who truly love and worship sailor moon.  Buy this film and keep on loving sailor moon. ^_^",4,Okay....but not the best of sailor moon,1113091200,"04 10, 2005",2005,4197,"['see', 'i', 'dont', 'stand', 'alone', 'when', 'i', 'say', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'SuperS', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'people', 'had', 'hoped', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'R', 'fans', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'following', 'movies', 'hearts', 'ice', 'filled', 'expectations', 'viewers', 'SuperS', 'left', 'bit', 'dissapointed', 'Perhaps', 'due', 'inconsistancy', 'when', 'actual', 'series', 'maybe', 'story', 'line', 'left', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'Im', 'not', 'exaclty', 'sure', 'what', 'i', 'am', 'sure', 'having', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'sailor', 'mooon', 'fan', 'own', 'seen', 'episode', 'made', 'SuperS', 'just', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'standard.You', ""'re"", 'probably', 'wondering', 'then', 'why', 'i', 'gave', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'then', 'well', 'even', 'tho', 'not', 'best', 'sailor', 'moon', 'movie', '.it', 'still', 'good', 'watch', 'kill', 'time', 'still', 'moments', 'help', 'redeme', 'eyes', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'right', 'sailor', 'moon', 'breaks', 'free', 'dream', 'box', 'must', 'carry', 'chibi-moon', 'black', 'dream', 'hole', 'being', 'assalted', 'fire', 'quickly', 'sap', 'strength', '.she', 'then', 'power', 'other', 'senshi', 'gaining', 'strength', 'able', 'bust', 'fire', 'dream', 'hole.Now', 'part', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'was', 'whole', 'thing', 'outer', 'senshi', 'Neptune', 'Uranus', 'Pluto', 'coming', 'back', 'whole', 'thing', 'doesnt', 'make', 'sense', 'senshi', 'dont', 'come', 'back', 'fifth', 'season', 'Stars', 'have', 'watched', 'Stars', 'will', 'realize', 'quickly', 'when', 'come', 'back', 'first', 'time', 'not', 'second', 'movie', 'would', 'suggest', 'So', 'whole', 'thing', 'doesnt', 'quite', 'fit', 'how', 'series', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'can', 'get', 'confusing', 'going', 'make', 'movie', 'return', 'outer', 'senshi', 'then', 'should', 'least', 'make', 'series', 'first', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'sailor', 'saturn', 'was', 'too', 'aside', 'fact', 'coming', 'back', 'not', 'fit', 'series', 'make', 'great', 'contribution', 'film', 'make', 'watching', 'more', 'likely', 'part', 'reason', 'bringing', 'film', 'great', 'see', 'outer', 'senshi', 'again', 'entrance', 'film', 'susopension', 'bit', 'hurrah', 'sailor', 'moon.What', 'i', 'find', 'somewhat', 'humerous', 'movie', 'once', 'again', 'chibi-usa', 'falls', 'love', 'someone', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'may', 'be', 'hope', 'Helios', 'none', 'Mamoru', 'Paperu', 'i', 'think', 'how', 'spelled', 'always', 'ones', 'cant', 'be', 'whole', 'love', 'thing', 'Mamoru', 'sooooo', 'wrong', 'sick', 'whenever', 'see', 'fawning', 'father', '.so', 'why', 'hell', 'trying', 'come', 'Usagi', 'sometimes', 'EW', 'i', 'were', 'usagi', 'i', 'would', 'tell', 'chibi-usa', 'would', 'become', 'celebate', 'wont', 'exist', 'keep', 'paws', 'off', 'Mamoru', '.heheh', 'should', 'get', 'whole', 'love', 'thing', 'paperu', 'i', 'must', 'say', 'cute', 'are', 'little', 'kids', '..ahhhh', 'young', 'love', 'hehehe', '.too', 'bad', 'dont', 'know', 'REAL', 'good', 'parts', 'love', 'yet', '^_^Well', 'big', 'sailor', 'moon', 'fan', 'i', 'would', 'urge', 'get', 'film', 'may', 'watch', 'add', 'sailor', 'moon', 'horde', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'best', 'either', 'story', 'line', 'fun', 'i', 'definitly', 'love', 'music', 'sure', 'urge', 'films', 'NOT', 'watch', 'english', 'version', 'down', 'right', 'horrible', 'times', 'voices', 'are', 'just', 'annoying', 'voice', 'acting', 'just', 'poor', '.i', 'havent', 'seen', 'anime', 'yet', 'where', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'good', '.i', 'wish', 'producers', 'would', 'stop', 'half', 'assing', 'voice', 'overs', 'are', 'just', 'going', 'do', 'crap', 'what', 'film', 'then', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'keep', 'subtitled', 'course', 'good', 'little', 'kids', 'dont', 'know', 'good', 'acting', 'yet', 'parts', 'might', 'see', 'unsutable', 'kids', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'when', 'usagi', 'spanks', 'chibi-usa', 'i', 'dont', 'exaclty', 'get', 'why', 'was', 'cut', 'oh', 'well', '.but', 'japanese', 'version', 'uncut', 'made', 'who', 'truly', 'love', 'worship', 'sailor', 'moon', 'Buy', 'film', 'keep', 'loving', 'sailor', 'moon', '^_^']",Sailor Moon Super S VHS

507091,A1KISYZSUGHL5P,B00000JNTP,David Romano,"[0, 0]","Well, this is the third and final installment of the Sailor Moon movie series.  I have to say, in terms of dubbing, this is probably the best of  the lot.  The attacks were translated properly, although they STILL insist  on having Pluto shout her attack (watch the japanese series...she whispers  it!).  My biggest gripe was the kitchen scene...they kinda dumbed it down,  which kinda annoyed me...the japanese version was more dramatic and  personal...this one was pretty superficial.  Diana's voice irritated me to  no end as well...but since the powers that be refuse to dub season 5  (although they should...hint, hint, HINT)so i wont have to worry about that  ever again.  They timed the release of this video well, since by this time  season 3 has finished its initial run here in the states, so we're all  familiar with the Outer Senshi.  Overall it was a really good dub...the  story was not as butchered as the first, and the voices were better than  the second in terms of the Outer Soldiers.  Well, enjoy!

507092,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00000JNTP,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 2]","I saw this movie a year ago and I remember how I felt that it was good but more geared to the younger audience and also how that song the kids were  singing kept staying in my head.The story focuses this time on Chibi  Usa or Mini Moon (whatever name the Dub uses).  The movie is definitely  geared for a younger audience and the parts that make you feel sad like in  the previous movies, is not here in the fourth movie.  In my opinion, I  feel that this movie is the weakest of all Sailor Moon movies.When I say  weak...I don't mean bad...I mean it doesn't make me want to watch this many  times.  I like the sad storylines...btw, for the Sailor Moon fans.. I was  hoping they would get Sailor Saturn in this movie but I guess that psycho  storyline on Sailor Moon S was too scary for kids.As for the  animation, I'm glad it wasn't as faded as Sailor Moon S but where the DVD  for R was an improvement over it's predecessor, this DVD is not better than  R...  Not much in terms for special features this time around.  The  production stills are still nice but I wonder why they never include the  movie trailers.  Those trailers are pretty cool!Anyway, if you have  bought the other two DVD's and are a fan of the series, you will most  likely purchase this DVD anyway.  But if you are a fan and don't know which  DVD to buy out of the three movies, start with the first one and go in  continuation.  A definite must-see for fans of Chibi Usa.

It's obvious the studio put a lot of  money into this production. It also has an incredibly charming opening  credit sequence that is probably the cutest part of the entire film series!The fairly straightforward plot introduces the evil Lady Vadiane, a  giant magical being who sends her 3 Fairy minions to Earth to capture  children. She plans to use their 'Sugar Energy' to power a giant black hole  with which to absorb the entire Earth! After Chibi-Usa (Rini) is captured  in one of the raids, it's up to the Sailor Team to rescue her and save the  world yet again.Some familiarity with the original series might be  helpful before watching since the girls all have new attacks, and new  Senshi and a new feline character have been added to the cast. It's not  absolutely necessary though.There is some implied nudity in the form of  drawn outlines of the girls bodies in rainbow colored energy forms. But  parents would probably be hard-pressed to find this one scene offensive for  younger viewers.In fact, it's probably younger fans who'll get more out  of this one, with it's colorful attacks, cute production designs, and  nonstop action. For more mature SM lovers; aside from the usual powerful  bonds between the girls, some fun moments with Usagi(Serina) and her  long-suffering boyfriend Mamoru(Darien) and the usual comedic bickering  between Chibi-Usa and Usagi, there isn't a whole lot here. Good heros need  good enemies and in this case, Vadiane just doesn't cut it. She's a very  powerful being, but an extremely one-dimensional one. There's no  explaination of exactly WHY she wants to destroy the Earth, other than just  being evil. This really hurts the films sense of drama, as the evil Queen  just becomes another straw figure to be easily knocked over by Usagi and  friends. It's such a pity that an otherwise fine production has to fall  down in this one respect. I know it can be difficult to creat an  interesting character with less than an hour of screentime to work with,  but surely a few throwaway lines couldn't have hurt.All in all though  it's a good adventure to add to your Sailor Moon collection, but definately  purchase the R and S movies first.",3,One for the fans.,962928000,"07 7, 2000",2000,2363,"['third', 'consecutive', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'film', 'SailorMoon', 'SuperS', 'absolutely', 'lovely', 'musical', 'score', 'doubt', 'most', 'beautifully', 'animated', 'SM', 'adventure', 'yet', 'obvious', 'studio', 'put', 'lot', 'money', 'production', 'also', 'incredibly', 'charming', 'opening', 'credit', 'sequence', 'probably', 'cutest', 'part', 'entire', 'film', 'series', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'plot', 'evil', 'Lady', 'Vadiane', 'giant', 'magical', 'being', 'who', '3', 'Fairy', 'minions', 'Earth', 'capture', 'children', 'use', ""'Sugar"", 'Energy', 'power', 'giant', 'black', 'hole', 'absorb', 'entire', 'Earth', 'Chibi-Usa', 'Rini', 'captured', 'one', 'raids', 'up', 'Sailor', 'Team', 'rescue', 'save', 'world', 'yet', 'again.Some', 'familiarity', 'original', 'series', 'might', 'be', 'helpful', 'watching', 'girls', 'have', 'new', 'attacks', 'new', 'Senshi', 'new', 'feline', 'character', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'cast', 'not', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'implied', 'nudity', 'form', 'drawn', 'outlines', 'girls', 'bodies', 'rainbow', 'colored', 'energy', 'forms', 'parents', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'find', 'one', 'scene', 'offensive', 'younger', 'viewers.In', 'fact', 'probably', 'younger', 'fans', 'who', ""'ll"", 'get', 'more', 'one', 'colorful', 'attacks', 'cute', 'production', 'designs', 'nonstop', 'action', 'more', 'mature', 'SM', 'lovers', 'aside', 'usual', 'powerful', 'bonds', 'girls', 'fun', 'moments', 'Usagi', 'Serina', 'long-suffering', 'boyfriend', 'Mamoru', 'Darien', 'usual', 'comedic', 'bickering', 'Chibi-Usa', 'Usagi', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'here', 'Good', 'heros', 'need', 'good', 'enemies', 'case', 'Vadiane', 'just', ""n't"", 'cut', 'very', 'powerful', 'being', 'extremely', 'one-dimensional', 'one', 'explaination', 'exactly', 'WHY', 'destroy', 'Earth', 'other', 'just', 'being', 'evil', 'really', 'films', 'sense', 'drama', 'evil', 'Queen', 'just', 'straw', 'figure', 'be', 'easily', 'knocked', 'over', 'Usagi', 'friends', 'such', 'pity', 'otherwise', 'fine', 'production', 'fall', 'down', 'one', 'respect', 'know', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'creat', 'interesting', 'character', 'less', 'hour', 'screentime', 'work', 'surely', 'few', 'throwaway', 'lines', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'hurt.All', 'good', 'adventure', 'add', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'collection', 'definately', 'purchase', 'R', 'S', 'movies', 'first']",Sailor Moon Super S VHS

SHows off  different attacks, but the plot line is not original at all.",3,Wait for DVD!!!!,934070400,"08 8, 1999",1999,653,"['Hey', 'Sailormoon', 'fans', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'want', 'get', 'subbed', 'version', 'dubbed', 'version', 'movies', 'might', 'suggest', 'waiting', 'few', 'months', 'DVD', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'Then', 'get', 'best', 'worlds', 'Rankings', 'movies', 'own', 'already', 'Sailormoon', 'R', 'Quite', 'really', 'best', 'three', 'most', 'dramatic', 'heart-wrenching', 'Sailormoon', 'S', 'Good', 'light', 'story', 'great', 'see', 'Outer', 'Senshi', 'use', 'powers', 'Luna', 'turn', 'Human', 'Sailormoon', 'Super', 'S', 'Really', 'very', 'sweet', 'saccharine', 'Great', 'younger', 'fans', 'who', 'Chibi-usa', 'different', 'attacks', 'plot', 'line', 'not', 'original']",Sailor Moon Super S VHS
507114,A5CWLQF6QO3CN,B00000JNTP,"Tso Haven Hei Wan ""Havenough Dupont Randall-B...","[0, 0]","Frankly speaking the target audience for the Sailormoon series should never be small children - premature love, gays, lesbians, transexual characters were all too often in the series, which I think strong parental guidance is needed to explain them to small children.Nonetheless, the SuperS movie should still be a good choice in a way that the plot is developed in a much sensible way. Although as usual Mr. Tuxedo Mask is nothing more than low level supporting character (which happened since the S series and particularly true in the Sailor Stars series), the parts of other characters are fairly equal and balance. If you love Chibimoon, probably you would enjoy watching her using the Moon Gorgeous Meditation instead of the useless Twinkle Yell. Also, this is the place where Uranus' Space Sword Blaster and Neptune's Submarine Reflection first appeared (although the action development of these two attacks are much better in the Sailor Stars series).One point worth mentioning is that in the Japanese original LD format, it is quite strange that in some of scenes, the picture quality shows some sudden down turns from time to time, which makes the movie very odd while watching it.Anyway, if you are a big fan of the series, just could not miss it. It is also a good choice before watching the Sailor Stars sequel.",5,A spectacular end to the movie series,1008028800,"12 11, 2001",2001,1323,"['Frankly', 'speaking', 'target', 'audience', 'Sailormoon', 'series', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'small', 'children', 'premature', 'love', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'transexual', 'characters', 'were', 'too', 'often', 'series', 'think', 'strong', 'parental', 'guidance', 'needed', 'explain', 'small', 'children.Nonetheless', 'SuperS', 'movie', 'should', 'still', 'be', 'good', 'choice', 'way', 'plot', 'developed', 'much', 'sensible', 'way', 'usual', 'Mr', 'Tuxedo', 'Mask', 'nothing', 'more', 'low', 'level', 'supporting', 'character', 'happened', 'S', 'series', 'particularly', 'true', 'Sailor', 'Stars', 'series', 'parts', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'fairly', 'equal', 'balance', 'love', 'Chibimoon', 'probably', 'would', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'using', 'Moon', 'Gorgeous', 'Meditation', 'instead', 'useless', 'Twinkle', 'Yell', 'Also', 'place', 'where', 'Uranus', 'Space', 'Sword', 'Blaster', 'Neptune', 'Submarine', 'Reflection', 'first', 'appeared', 'action', 'development', 'two', 'attacks', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'Sailor', 'Stars', 'series', '.One', 'point', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Japanese', 'original', 'LD', 'format', 'quite', 'strange', 'scenes', 'picture', 'quality', 'sudden', 'down', 'turns', 'time', 'time', 'movie', 'very', 'odd', 'watching', 'it.Anyway', 'are', 'big', 'fan', 'series', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'miss', 'also', 'good', 'choice', 'watching', 'Sailor', 'Stars', 'sequel']",Sailor Moon Super S VHS
