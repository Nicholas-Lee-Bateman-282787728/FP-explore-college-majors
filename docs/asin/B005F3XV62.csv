Kevin James' bath scene is one of the most horrifying scenes in cinematic series.... it gives the shower scene ofPsycho (Collector's Edition)a run for its money. Kevin James woos Stephanie (Leslie Bibb), despite the fact she's found another boyfriend and seems to have moved on. In order to impress her, he works as a car salesman. Though this movie is set in Boston, there are a few tantalizing glimpses of Bean Town's beauty.... plus, there is a plug for TGI Friday's when Kevin brings a gorilla with him. Rosario Dawson (Rent (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition),Josie and the Pussycats) stars as Kevin's assistant, who has secretly loved him. As if the awfulAsh Wednesdayweren't penitential enough?

1457407,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005F3XV62,Andrew Ellington,"[7, 11]","I love Kevin James.  I think that he is hilarious.  I knew walking in that `Zookeeper' had the poor reviews that usually indicate a real stinker, especially in this genre, but I always consider Kevin James a presence that can and usually does make even a terrible film worth watching at least once.Yeah, not so much for this one.Honestly, `Zookeeper' may be the worst film I've seen in a very long time.  There is very little funny here, in fact possibly nothing at all.  I think the ONLY time I even cracked a smile was during the wedding scene, and half of that was out of sheer awkwardness (but it was semi-humorous at that).  Overall, this film is a gigantic mess; a mix of wasted talent and uninspired regurgitation of potty humor that never hits where it intends.The story is that of an oaph of a man; Griffin.  He is a large bodied, simple living zookeeper that is undeniably sweet natured and so, somehow, a girl as hot and self-centered as Leslie Bibb is interested in dating him, only to reveal that his profession is too much for her to handle and so she turns his marriage proposal down.  Years later he's still dwelling in misery over it all.  He complains about his loneliness to his animal friends at the zoo and so when they see an opportunity to get Griffin and his long lost romance back together, they take action.  Soon they have Griffin roaring and walking with his package extended and peeing in potted plants and basically making a total fool of himself and yet, magically, it starts to work.  But, in changing himself he begins to regret his decisions and, well, you'll guess from the pretty early on who he's going to wind up with anyways; but that's the nature of the beast.Sadly, this talking animal flick has nothing to offer.  The animals are the worst part of the film.  I remember when Eddie Murphy did `Doctor Doolittle'.  Honestly, it was pretty clever and while some of the gags were predictable they were effective.  This is such a polar opposite.  The animals are crude and unfunny, and their interactions and staged comedic dialog is awkward and far too lowbrow for its own good.  The voice work, especially Sandler's, is obnoxious and cringe-worthy.  The `message' aspect of the film is poorly executed (the mean caretaker side of things was an afterthought entirely) and certain sequences are just too ridiculous (TGIF) that it makes this whole experience a complete and total waste.I still love you Kevin; I just advise you to steer clear of Adam Sandler.",1,"In every zoo, there is poop...",1320019200,"10 31, 2011",2011,2495,"['love', 'Kevin', 'James', 'think', 'hilarious', 'knew', 'walking', 'Zookeeper', 'had', 'poor', 'reviews', 'usually', 'indicate', 'real', 'stinker', 'especially', 'genre', 'always', 'consider', 'Kevin', 'James', 'presence', 'can', 'usually', 'make', 'even', 'terrible', 'film', 'watching', 'least', 'once.Yeah', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'one.Honestly', 'may', 'be', 'worst', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'very', 'little', 'funny', 'here', 'fact', 'possibly', 'nothing', 'think', 'ONLY', 'time', 'even', 'cracked', 'smile', 'was', 'wedding', 'scene', 'half', 'was', 'sheer', 'awkwardness', 'was', 'semi-humorous', 'Overall', 'film', 'gigantic', 'mess', 'mix', 'wasted', 'talent', 'uninspired', 'regurgitation', 'potty', 'humor', 'never', 'where', 'intends.The', 'story', 'oaph', 'man', 'Griffin', 'large', 'bodied', 'simple', 'living', 'zookeeper', 'undeniably', 'sweet', 'natured', 'so', 'somehow', 'girl', 'hot', 'self-centered', 'Leslie', 'Bibb', 'interested', 'dating', 'only', 'reveal', 'profession', 'too', 'much', 'handle', 'so', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'down', 'Years', 'later', 'still', 'dwelling', 'misery', 'loneliness', 'animal', 'friends', 'zoo', 'so', 'when', 'see', 'opportunity', 'get', 'Griffin', 'long', 'lost', 'romance', 'back', 'together', 'take', 'action', 'Soon', 'have', 'Griffin', 'roaring', 'walking', 'package', 'extended', 'peeing', 'potted', 'plants', 'basically', 'making', 'total', 'fool', 'yet', 'magically', 'work', 'changing', 'regret', 'decisions', 'well', ""'ll"", 'guess', 'pretty', 'early', 'who', 'going', 'wind', 'up', 'anyways', 'nature', 'beast.Sadly', 'talking', 'animal', 'flick', 'nothing', 'offer', 'animals', 'are', 'worst', 'part', 'film', 'remember', 'when', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'did', 'Doctor', 'Doolittle', 'Honestly', 'was', 'pretty', 'clever', 'gags', 'were', 'predictable', 'were', 'effective', 'such', 'polar', 'opposite', 'animals', 'are', 'crude', 'unfunny', 'interactions', 'staged', 'comedic', 'dialog', 'awkward', 'far', 'too', 'lowbrow', 'own', 'good', 'voice', 'work', 'especially', 'Sandler', 'obnoxious', 'cringe-worthy', 'message', 'aspect', 'film', 'poorly', 'executed', 'mean', 'caretaker', 'side', 'things', 'was', 'afterthought', 'entirely', 'certain', 'sequences', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'ridiculous', 'TGIF', 'whole', 'experience', 'complete', 'total', 'waste.I', 'still', 'love', 'Kevin', 'just', 'advise', 'steer', 'clear', 'Adam', 'Sandler']",N/A

I am a fan of Kevin James but didn't have the highest of hopes for a movie that features a lot of talking animals.  With that said, I was pleasantly surprised with this movie.  Kevin James plays a Zookeeper who has a thing for a woman that turns down his marriage proposal because, well, he is a zookeeper and that just isn't a real / serious profession.The movie is part romantic comedy but even more integral to the film here is the interaction between all of the zoo animals, who all love James, and plot to help him find happiness.  I thought the computer generated animals were brilliant and that helped make this movie a whole lot of fun.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 2]","ZOOKEEPER (2011) with the silent-era-style charming Kevin James and the beautiful Rosario Dawson is a charming family comedy. Firstly, I am a sucker for zoo-themed films. If you can get past the uglyMadagascar (Full Screen Edition)taste this leaves in your mouth, you're home free!Kevin plays a lonely zookeeper who is in love with the wrongest of the wrong woman. When the animals decide to talk to him - they can all talk, people simply cannot handle it so they keep quiet, but they love him and want to help - well, what do you think will happen?As usual with Kevin's films (I've only ever seen him inPaul Blart: Mall Copwhich I loved), there were many missed cues in this. Opportunities to go for the big laugh fell flat or were bypassed. I can't tell if it is Kevin's humor or bad directing; it simply confuses. Rosario Dawson, aside from being gorgeous and talented, may be the funniest element in the film.However, I admire any comic who reminds me of the Immortal Master Buster Keaton - and Kevin James is like that. Here, as in BLART, he goes for the not-so-obvious sight gag, the pratfall when it is least convenient, and the surprising spring to action. Done perfectly, that is the highest art of comedy. Kevin does have a ways to go, but he tries.With the vocal talents of the likes of Nick Nolte, Sylvester Stallone, Adam Sandler (whom I despise), and others, you will not want for laughs or silliness.

1457441,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B005F3XV62,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[7, 14]","ZOOKEEPERIt is no secret that I am a Kevin James fan and I guarantee that I will enjoy any thing that the man is in. I LOVED his show ""The King of Queens"" and have loved all of his films including his first Happy Madison film ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"". Would did I love it you may ask, well because of the cast but also because my little cuz loved it. When you go to see these family films with the kids you can't help but enjoy it when you know they are. Well that same thing can be said here with James's latest Happy Madison flick ""Zookeeper"".Now before I go further I want people to really reread that first paragraph particularly about the kids. I have read many a review on other sites that have been negative towards this film, which is fine. People have the right to their opinion but when you say a film is unrealistic then be realistic in your review. This film is for kids and it is obvious, if you go to see a movie with talking animals then I really don't want to hear you say it is unrealistic. It wasn't made for you it is for the kids therefore the family friendly PG rating it has. Also I have read people talking about a super hot woman let alone two getting with Kevin James could not happen. That is funny because he is actually married to a super hot woman, who actually plays his brother's wife in this movie.The film follows Griffin Keyes [James] who still yearns for his ex but still loves his job. The thing is his job is what broke them up in the first place since she wanted him to do more with his life. He though loves his job and loves the animals he cares for and they love him back. It is with that said they all decide to help out their favorite Zookeeper and help him get his girl back. Of course in doing so they break the code that says they can not speak to humans. Add in that one of Griffin's fellow workers at the Zoo Kate [Rosario Dawson] could be the actual girl for him and a crazy new boyfriend of his ex played by Joe Rogan is in the picture and you have one entertaining flick.Now like I said before this film will not be for everybody and any one wanting a serious film will be disappointed. This is indeed a comedy and a family friendly comedy at that aimed towards kids. Kevin James is perfect here in his role as the love struck bumbling type guy, he always is. James is a very funny guy because he is completely believable and likeable. I also like the fact that he likes making films geared towards kids so when they come out I can take my cuz and nieces and nephew to his films. ""Paul Blart"" was a PG film and now this one; add in the animated films like ""Barn Yard"" and it is obvious he likes to make these types of films.I would also love to point out MMA legend Bas Rutten voices Sebastian the Wolf and legendary MMA trainer Mark DellaGrotte cameos in this film. With that said I would like to say that Bas did an excellent job as the Wolf and was hilarious. Also MMA commentator/comedian Joe Rogan was exactly the right person for the boyfriend of the ex. He is wonderful funny and evil in this, loved him here. Speaking of the ex Leslie Bibb is excellent here plays the perfect gold digger like character who wants to change him. Rosario Dawson as well is wonderful as always in this film and I have to admit that I love her; she is one of my favorite actresses.Donnie Wahlberg and Ken Jeong are great as well even though they are not in it as much as I would have wanted, especially Wahlberg. From the entire live cast all the way to the voice actors like Adam Sandler, Stallone and them this was a fun flick. You know what, that is what this is all about, fun. For kids or not this is a fun movie, Kevin James and the cast that was put together and talking animals could be nothing but. Any film in which a gorilla voiced by Nick Nolte goes partying at a TGI Friday's has to be fun. That of course is one of many fun scenes in this film, yeah, a fun flick.I honestly wish I could find the words to really say how much fun this was but I can't. All I can say is that not only was it entertaining but listening to the kids crack up the whole time was wonderful. Also I don't know if every theater with this did this but all the kids got ""Zookeeper"" posters with animal facts on the back. Of course my girl, brother and I got one each as well, got to add that to the movie poster collection. So I do recommend this flick because it is good, it may not be the best film ever depending your taste but it is good. Remember the target audience and go in with that mindset and you will like it.

They're at that age when it's just not cool to laugh at something your parents like as well so they stifle their guffaws as much as possible while you smile and laugh out loud. Too bad because they miss out on some fun movies that way. Movies like ZOOKEEPER.The movie opens with Kevin James as Griffin proposing on a sandy beach at sunset while riding a horse to the woman he loves, Stephanie (Leslie Bibb). Unfortunately unlike most youtube videos, she turns him down explaining how she thought he'd change and leave behind life working in a zoo. She wants someone more upwardly mobile.Fast forward a few years and Griffin is still working in the Franklin Park Zoo. He loves his work and he loves the animals he cares for. While taking care of them all, he pays particular attention to Bernie the gorilla. Bernie has kind of sequestered himself from contact with anyone who comes his way including Griffin who tries his best to cheer him up.Griffin's brother is about to get married and they hold the engagement party at the zoo thanks to Griffin. But as he begins to make a speech about the new couple he notices Stephanie in the background and stumbles on every word out of his mouth. It turns up that Stephanie is back in town and was invited by the bride. Could she and Griffin reunite? As the animals listen in to their conversation it appears a possibility.That night the animals call a meeting and discuss how to make Griffin more attractive to Stephanie and reunite the pair. If not one of the overheard discussions was Griffin talking about leaving and they want him to stay. Somehow they have to unite the pair and at the same time not let Griffin know they can speak. But of course things go wrong and the main animal, Joe the lion (Sylvester Stallone) lets lose scaring Griffin.The animals come together and let Griffin know they can talk now and do their best to school him on how to get Stephanie back. The problem is while their intentions are good the ideas they offer him work more in the animal kingdom than in the land of humans.While all this is going on Griffin helps one of the zoo doctors, Kate (Rosario Dawson). They pair work well together, especially in the case of helping save Janet the lioness (voice of Cher). It was due to Griffin's saving her from choking to death that the animals decided to help.Taking the advice of the animals Griffin does his best to win Stephanie back. But this time around he not only has to convince her he can be the man she longs for but he must also compete with a Neanderthal of a new boyfriend Gale (Joe Rogan). In an attempt to face off against this jerk, Griffin has Kate go with him to the wedding in an attempt to make Stephanie jealous. But something else begins to happen.The film offers a back and forth from the world of Griffin's romance to his love of the animals he cares for. Can he leave behind all that he holds dear in an attempt at love with a woman who wants him to be something else? And what about Kate, is something going on there?The answer is simple if you ever seen a romantic comedy made since say 1925. It's also a staple of the romantic comedy that the main protagonist not realize who he really loves or what he wants to do until the last moments of the film. But knowing this is what will happen or not doesn't matter, it's the journey to that moment that makes this movie such fun.A huge cast of big names offer voice talent here along with the others mentioned. Adam Sandler plays a monkey Judd Apatow an elephant, Donald Faizon and Jon Favreau a pair of bears and more. All of them have some hilarious lines and moments that are a joy to watch, especially Nick Nolte as Bernie the gorilla. The scenes this character shares with James are a hoot, especially a trip in the outside world to TGIFridays. If you go there you'll be looking for an ape next time.The movie is fairly predictable but it doesn't matter. It has plenty of laughs, a touching story and holds your interest throughout. James does a great job doing plenty of physical comedy and adds a nice touch to the romantic side he offers, especially not appearing as the normal hunk of the month. All in all this movie offers a good time at any price and is actually one worth adding to your collection.

1457517,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B005F3XV62,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[4, 8]","It's hard to rate a movie like Zookeeper.  On the one hand, no one's going to say that it's a must-see comedy. But on the other hand, it's better than the average film of this sort, and while it's completely predictable, it does manage to keep you entertained and you still laugh even when you know what's coming. And some of the scenes are true comic gold, even if the film as a whole can't maintain that high level.The plot:  Griffin Keyes (Kevin James) is a zookeeper at the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston, a job which he loves but which gets him little respect. Particularly from his girlfriend Stephanie (Leslie Bibb), who dumps him at the beginning of the movie just as he's in the middle of his elaborately planned proposal of marriage, stating that she just can't see herself getting serious with a zookeeper. Crushed, Griffin briefly considers quitting his job and going to work for his brother, Dave (Nat Faxon), who has a high-end car dealership, but Kate (Rosario Dawson), the zoo's vet, talks him out of it. Five years later, when Dave is getting married, Stephanie suddenly reappears. Griffin is just as smitten with her as he was five years before. Now he's seriously considering quitting in order to win her, enough so that the zoo animals - who consider him the best keeper they've ever had - decide to take action. Starting with revealing to a very startled Griffin that they can in fact talk. Knowing that the only way to get Griffin to stay is to help him win Stephanie, they proceed to bombard him with all kinds of mating advice, varying according to the animal giving it. Griffin's attempts to follow their advice have, as one might expect, highly variable and sometimes disastrous results.Admittedly, high comedy or classic comedy, Zookeeper is not. It's one-hundred percent predictable but you still laugh, mainly because of the talented cast (live and voice actors), who manage to keep things lively enough that you still want to see things unfold in spite of knowing what will happen. Kevin James is perfect as the hapless Griffin (you know you're hapless when you're taking dating advice from talking animals). Leslie Bibb does a nice turn as the gorgeous but devastatingly shallow Stephanie.  And Joe Rogan is deliciously obnoxious as Stephanie's uber-testosteroned boyfriend Gale.But hey, Zookeeper is really about the talking animals and the film's technical and animal-handling crew did an excellent job, both in making it look like they're actually talking and in managing to give them a lot of physical expressiveness in their roles. The voice-actors behind the live animals were superbly cast and all did a great job of bringing their animal characters to life:  Nick Nolte's gorilla Bernie gives the film a lot of its best moments; Adam Sandler's cheeky monkey Donald, who's always lording his opposable thumbs over the other animals and whose fall-back advice for any situation is ""throw poo at them""; the mated lions - Sylvester Stallone's Joe and Cher's Janet - have some of the best dialogue in the film, arguing like a real married couple over who's better suited to give advice; Judd Apatow's elephant Barry has a fear of confrontation and a hay-eating disorder; Jon Favreau (yeah, that Jon Favreau, director of Iron Man I & II) and Faizon Love are Jerome and Bruce, a couple of male bears constantly ranking on each other, are a riot; and Don Rickles gets in some particularly bad advice as a frog.There are a few let downs, largely I feel to weaknesses in the script. While some scenes are brilliantly funny, others don't quite hit the mark and a few simply go on too long. And while most of the characters are decently written, a few  were either poorly thought out or inadequately developed. Ken Jeong, who was brilliantly funny in films like Knocked Up, Role Models and The Hangover movies, never quite hits the mark as Venom, a co-worker of Griffin's whose social skills make everyone around him cringe. Donnie Wahlberg is wasted as Shane, a cardboard bad-guy who mistreats one of the animals at the zoo.  And the extremely talented Rosario Dawson, whose veteranarian Kate is key to the plot, isn't really fleshed out enough to make her relationship with Griffin really believeable.But all that said, Zookeeper remains a decent film that meets the expectations the trailers set up.  Recommended as a light comedy with a few memorable scenes, a pleasant enough way to pass a couple of hours.",3,A decent 3 and 1/2 star comedy,1310083200,"07 8, 2011",2011,4435,"['hard', 'rate', 'movie', 'Zookeeper', 'one', 'hand', 'one', 'going', 'say', 'must-see', 'comedy', 'other', 'hand', 'better', 'average', 'film', 'sort', 'completely', 'predictable', 'manage', 'keep', 'entertained', 'still', 'even', 'when', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'scenes', 'are', 'true', 'comic', 'gold', 'even', 'film', 'whole', 'ca', ""n't"", 'maintain', 'high', 'level.The', 'plot', 'Griffin', 'Keyes', 'Kevin', 'James', 'zookeeper', 'Franklin', 'Park', 'Zoo', 'Boston', 'job', 'little', 'respect', 'Particularly', 'girlfriend', 'Stephanie', 'Leslie', 'Bibb', 'who', 'dumps', 'beginning', 'movie', 'just', 'middle', 'elaborately', 'planned', 'proposal', 'marriage', 'stating', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'getting', 'serious', 'zookeeper', 'Crushed', 'Griffin', 'briefly', 'considers', 'quitting', 'job', 'going', 'work', 'brother', 'Dave', 'Nat', 'Faxon', 'who', 'high-end', 'car', 'dealership', 'Kate', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'zoo', 'vet', 'Five', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'Dave', 'getting', 'married', 'Stephanie', 'suddenly', 'Griffin', 'just', 'as', 'smitten', 'was', 'five', 'years', 'Now', 'seriously', 'considering', 'quitting', 'order', 'win', 'enough', 'zoo', 'animals', 'who', 'consider', 'best', 'keeper', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'decide', 'take', 'action', 'Starting', 'revealing', 'very', 'startled', 'Griffin', 'can', 'fact', 'talk', 'Knowing', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'Griffin', 'stay', 'help', 'win', 'Stephanie', 'proceed', 'bombard', 'kinds', 'mating', 'advice', 'varying', 'according', 'animal', 'giving', 'Griffin', 'attempts', 'follow', 'advice', 'have', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'highly', 'variable', 'sometimes', 'disastrous', 'results.Admittedly', 'high', 'comedy', 'classic', 'comedy', 'Zookeeper', 'not', 'one-hundred', 'percent', 'predictable', 'still', 'mainly', 'talented', 'cast', 'live', 'voice', 'actors', 'who', 'manage', 'keep', 'things', 'lively', 'enough', 'still', 'want', 'see', 'things', 'unfold', 'spite', 'knowing', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Kevin', 'James', 'perfect', 'hapless', 'Griffin', 'know', ""'re"", 'hapless', 'when', ""'re"", 'taking', 'dating', 'advice', 'talking', 'animals', 'Leslie', 'Bibb', 'nice', 'turn', 'gorgeous', 'devastatingly', 'shallow', 'Stephanie', 'Joe', 'Rogan', 'deliciously', 'obnoxious', 'Stephanie', 'uber-testosteroned', 'boyfriend', 'Gale.But', 'hey', 'Zookeeper', 'really', 'talking', 'animals', 'film', 'technical', 'animal-handling', 'crew', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'making', 'look', ""'re"", 'actually', 'talking', 'managing', 'give', 'lot', 'physical', 'expressiveness', 'roles', 'voice-actors', 'live', 'animals', 'were', 'superbly', 'cast', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'animal', 'characters', 'life', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'gorilla', 'Bernie', 'film', 'lot', 'best', 'moments', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'cheeky', 'monkey', 'Donald', 'who', 'always', 'lording', 'opposable', 'thumbs', 'other', 'animals', 'fall-back', 'advice', 'situation', 'throw', 'poo', 'mated', 'lions', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Joe', 'Cher', 'Janet', 'have', 'best', 'dialogue', 'film', 'arguing', 'real', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'better', 'suited', 'give', 'advice', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'elephant', 'Barry', 'fear', 'confrontation', 'hay-eating', 'disorder', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'yeah', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'director', 'Iron', 'Man', 'II', 'Faizon', 'Love', 'are', 'Jerome', 'Bruce', 'couple', 'male', 'bears', 'constantly', 'ranking', 'other', 'are', 'riot', 'Don', 'Rickles', 'particularly', 'bad', 'advice', 'are', 'few', 'let', 'downs', 'largely', 'feel', 'weaknesses', 'script', 'scenes', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'funny', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hit', 'mark', 'few', 'simply', 'go', 'too', 'long', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'decently', 'written', 'few', 'were', 'either', 'poorly', 'thought', 'out', 'inadequately', 'developed', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'who', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'funny', 'films', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Role', 'Models', 'Hangover', 'movies', 'never', 'quite', 'mark', 'Venom', 'co-worker', 'Griffin', 'social', 'skills', 'make', 'everyone', 'cringe', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'wasted', 'Shane', 'cardboard', 'bad-guy', 'who', 'one', 'animals', 'zoo', 'extremely', 'talented', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'veteranarian', 'Kate', 'key', 'plot', ""n't"", 'really', 'fleshed', 'out', 'enough', 'make', 'relationship', 'Griffin', 'really', 'believeable.But', 'said', 'Zookeeper', 'decent', 'film', 'expectations', 'trailers', 'set', 'up', 'Recommended', 'light', 'comedy', 'few', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'way', 'pass', 'couple', 'hours']",N/A

First of all, Adam Sandler's voice was just plain annoying when he was doing the voice of the monkey.  I wanted to say to my television, ""Adam, you're trying too hard.  You're better than this!""  Also whoever did the voice of the giraffe was just PAINFUL to listen to.  I wanted to mute my TV everytime I saw that damn giraffe but I didn't cuz I didn't want to miss part of the story.Also at the end when Kevin James is running around trying to find Rosario Dawson's character cuz he doesn't want her to leave the country before he can talk to her, when he's doing all this running around and trying to catch her...  Why doesn't he just call her?  I'm sure she has a cell phone and since they worked together for five years, I'm sure he has her number.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***So this movie had a basic cookie cutter plot, guy tries to get girl, realizes that he doesn't want her and goes after the girl he has known his whole life that he really loves.
