First, as of today, there are two entries on Amazon for what appear to be the same thing with different prices ($4 different).  Both of these prices are higher than what it would cost to get them separately.  Next, the lack of content description is nearly unforgivable.  I copied this from another review on the ""other"" item (thanks, and I hope you don't mind!) and it matches what ebay says, as well I what I would guess because these were the first three released on DVD:(1) Creepy Crawly Fun (with: Inside the Haunted House, Going Batty & Spins a Web);(2) Space Adventures (with: Gets Lost in Space, Out of This World, and Taking Flight);(3) Holiday Special (with: Holiday Special (about recycling) All Dried Up, and In the Rainforest).I got these each individually when they came out, and all are good, my kids like them in moderation and they are almost 3 and 4.5.

715540,AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,B00006G8K3,PeaTee,"[40, 41]","This volume of Magic School Bus contains 3 different stories: Holiday Special, Rainforest, and All Dried Up.The Holiday Special is all about the importance of recycling. At one point, for example, the kids are shown how much of the Bus is from recycled products; glass and aluminum, etc.The Rainforest story hinges around cocoa and coca trees-- something I think most kids can relate to. The kids and Ms. Frizzle head off to rainforest when they can't make hot cocoa to find up ""what's up"".  A good explanation of the interrelationship of creatures and plants (ecology) follows.All dried up is about the desert and how although the desert environment is hostile and difficult that there are animals and plants that live there because of their adaptations.Though these tales are for older kids, I have been showing them to my 4 year old. She probably misses the fine nuances, but she has definitely gotten the major themes and it gives us a starting point to talk about animals and plants and why it is part of her job to help me with the recycling.Some of the Magic School Bus stories are frenetic, by the way, but these collections seem to be less so.

There are three episodes on this DVD: ""Holiday Special"" sees the kids go on a field trip to a recycling plant and in the process learn some insightful things about how recycling helps in conservation efforts. ""All Dried Up"" has Phoebe trying to save the animals and plants of the desert and in the process discovers that they are equipped to take care of themselves. ""In the Rainforest"" has the kids celebrating Earth Day in the rainforest and learning how cocoa pods, mud puddles and bugs are all part of the ecosystem.Though some of the concepts here are a bit complex for younger children [my daughter is 4], with parent's help they might actually have fun watching this show and even learn new ideas. I think older children will definitely learn a lot from these shows [6-10]. There are also bonus features on this DVD.
