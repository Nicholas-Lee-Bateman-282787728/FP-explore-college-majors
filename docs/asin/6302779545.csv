333464,A3SOV9HFM5H9T1,6302779545,Bruce P. Barten,"[2, 6]","This DVD is important to me mainly as a reminder of an important time in my life. Extra bonus material on the DVD and my reading ofNight (Oprah's Book Club)suggests that Nam vets have been quiet about certains aspects of their own experiences, so that reactions which change the audience could be much more radical than the contents of a documentary which does not attempt to reach so far into inner experiences while it can hardly avoid showing people who have gone through something that is not ordinary. I don't mind taking the worst kind of view, putting this show in the context of a theopathic state:Midpoint gentility factorsSeeking a sociology of knowledge worthy of 40 years of recapitulation of my year in Viet Nam, it strikes me that December 1969 was the midpoint of my year in Nam, as the Panama takeover of December 1989 was the low point that the Vet Center prepared me for in 1989 at the midpoint of my 40 years of recapitulation. Gentility was a major factor in 1989, though ironically it was called the wimp factor on the DVD The Panama Deception about the American invasion of Panama in December 1989. The DVD did not harp on religious issues like the book Night which won a Nobel Peace Prize for Elie Wiesel in 1986, but I had considered church activities a microcosm of my relationship with the world at large. Church attitudes deal with depression much more openly than superpower politics, I find December an extremely depressing dark time of year, and The Panama Deception fits in very well with the kind of cultivation of stupidity that treats underlings like cornering quivering cows in hecticity.I was still going to church with my family in Grand Rapids, Michigan, when I was home in 1968. Getting an obscene tattoo which would be offensive enough to make me 4-F for the draft seemed laughable compared to the conscientious objection granted with great gentility in the draft law. The Supreme Court was not sure that belief in a Supreme Being was necessary to be an opponent of wars, but my church and Congress considered God the main requirement for anyone who wished to submit to the kind of codes which granted gentility within the horizon it expected good people to remain within. It gets dark in December, so in December, 1968, I had a break in basic training to return to my family and the other guys in the army had a chance to get laid by someone familiar instead of a perfect stranger. Ten years later Jimmy Carter was ready to ask Congress to have men and women register for the draft, and by 1980, my own church's denomination in Minnesota was considering a resolution to have churches register young people as conscientious objectors so that if a draft call came, there could be an official record supported by an institution that recognizes a supreme being of C. O. status that draft boards were not going to keep track of as a routine matter.I was not a big fan of all the gentility crap in 1980. Outright opposition to the draft is weaker coming from young people who actually have a life to lose than coming from a bunch of old farts who clearly see how the cultivation of stupidity is always set up to corner quivering cows in hecticity. By 1989, the idea that a real Zapata, a former head of the CIA could become president of the United States and ask for a Statute of Limitations on arguing about the Vietnam War effective January 20, 1989, seemed like an attack upon every fiber of my being. At church, the usual method of gentility was to ask:Where is God in all this?In the darkness of each December, the old year dies and the birth of an infant God is celebrated. Life has cycles of growth and death that cyberpower has not managed to get to yet. Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, changed things for the United States of America more than September 11, 2001. Having opponents that can be defeated in a few years is almost cheerful compared to years of searching for money laundering without being able to nuke anybody.",4,like an earthquake on the Oakland freeway,1245715200,"06 23, 2009",2009,3969,"['DVD', 'important', 'mainly', 'reminder', 'important', 'time', 'life', 'Extra', 'bonus', 'material', 'DVD', 'reading', 'ofNight', 'Oprah', 'Book', 'Club', 'Nam', 'vets', 'have', 'been', 'quiet', 'certains', 'aspects', 'own', 'experiences', 'reactions', 'change', 'audience', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'radical', 'contents', 'documentary', 'not', 'attempt', 'reach', 'so', 'far', 'inner', 'experiences', 'can', 'hardly', 'avoid', 'showing', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'gone', 'something', 'not', 'ordinary', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'taking', 'worst', 'kind', 'view', 'putting', 'show', 'context', 'theopathic', 'state', 'Midpoint', 'gentility', 'factorsSeeking', 'sociology', 'knowledge', 'worthy', '40', 'years', 'recapitulation', 'year', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'December', '1969', 'was', 'midpoint', 'year', 'Nam', 'Panama', 'takeover', 'December', '1989', 'was', 'low', 'point', 'Vet', 'Center', 'prepared', '1989', 'midpoint', '40', 'years', 'recapitulation', 'Gentility', 'was', 'major', 'factor', '1989', 'ironically', 'was', 'called', 'wimp', 'factor', 'DVD', 'Panama', 'Deception', 'American', 'invasion', 'Panama', 'December', '1989', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'harp', 'religious', 'issues', 'book', 'Night', 'won', 'Nobel', 'Peace', 'Prize', 'Elie', 'Wiesel', '1986', 'had', 'considered', 'church', 'activities', 'microcosm', 'relationship', 'world', 'large', 'Church', 'deal', 'depression', 'much', 'more', 'openly', 'superpower', 'politics', 'find', 'December', 'extremely', 'depressing', 'dark', 'time', 'year', 'Panama', 'Deception', 'very', 'well', 'kind', 'cultivation', 'stupidity', 'underlings', 'cornering', 'quivering', 'cows', 'hecticity.I', 'was', 'still', 'going', 'church', 'family', 'Grand', 'Rapids', 'Michigan', 'when', 'was', 'home', '1968', 'Getting', 'obscene', 'tattoo', 'would', 'be', 'offensive', 'enough', 'make', '4-F', 'draft', 'seemed', 'laughable', 'compared', 'conscientious', 'objection', 'granted', 'great', 'gentility', 'draft', 'law', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'belief', 'Supreme', 'Being', 'was', 'necessary', 'be', 'opponent', 'wars', 'church', 'Congress', 'considered', 'God', 'main', 'requirement', 'anyone', 'who', 'wished', 'submit', 'kind', 'codes', 'granted', 'gentility', 'horizon', 'expected', 'good', 'people', 'remain', 'dark', 'December', 'so', 'December', '1968', 'had', 'break', 'basic', 'training', 'return', 'family', 'other', 'guys', 'army', 'had', 'chance', 'get', 'laid', 'someone', 'familiar', 'instead', 'perfect', 'stranger', 'Ten', 'years', 'later', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'was', 'ready', 'ask', 'Congress', 'have', 'men', 'women', 'register', 'draft', '1980', 'own', 'church', 'denomination', 'Minnesota', 'was', 'considering', 'resolution', 'have', 'churches', 'register', 'young', 'people', 'conscientious', 'objectors', 'so', 'draft', 'call', 'came', 'could', 'be', 'official', 'record', 'supported', 'institution', 'supreme', 'being', 'C.', 'O.', 'status', 'draft', 'boards', 'were', 'not', 'going', 'keep', 'track', 'routine', 'matter.I', 'was', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'gentility', 'crap', '1980', 'opposition', 'draft', 'weaker', 'coming', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'have', 'life', 'lose', 'coming', 'bunch', 'old', 'farts', 'who', 'clearly', 'see', 'how', 'cultivation', 'stupidity', 'always', 'set', 'up', 'corner', 'quivering', 'cows', 'hecticity', '1989', 'idea', 'real', 'Zapata', 'former', 'head', 'CIA', 'could', 'become', 'president', 'United', 'States', 'ask', 'Statute', 'Limitations', 'arguing', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'effective', 'January', '20', '1989', 'seemed', 'attack', 'fiber', 'being', 'church', 'usual', 'method', 'gentility', 'was', 'ask', 'Where', 'God', 'darkness', 'December', 'old', 'year', 'dies', 'birth', 'infant', 'God', 'celebrated', 'Life', 'cycles', 'growth', 'death', 'cyberpower', 'not', 'managed', 'get', 'yet', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'December', '7', '1941', 'changed', 'things', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'more', 'September', '11', '2001', 'Having', 'opponents', 'can', 'be', 'defeated', 'few', 'years', 'almost', 'cheerful', 'compared', 'years', 'searching', 'money', 'laundering', 'being', 'able', 'nuke', 'anybody']",N/A

As far as the American public was concerned, we sent troops into Panama because the people were suffering under the rule of a cruel, drug-running dictator. We came in and took him out of power, but there was some collateral civilian damage numbering somewhere into the double digits.Well according to this documentary (and they put forth some very compelling evidence) Manuel Noriega had his leash lengthened (including his dealings in drugs) as long as he provided us intel and means to supply guns to the Nicaraguan Contras in the famed Contra-Gate affair, along with our continued operation of the canal. Well, it seems Noriega got a bit too big for his britches and started thumbing his nose at us. So we sent a bunch of troops down, started a war, killed a lot (2,500 to 4,000) of civilians and dismantled their communications and press. They also used it to field test some nifty, new weaponry that would later be used in the Gulf War. During the initial crucial hours of the invasion the press was not allowed anywhere that anything was happening. So our government spoon fed them on what was happening, and they fed it to us on the nightly news.This is a true tragedy. The wholesale slaughter of civilians, including women and children, is barbaric. Not letting our press report, and then the press themselves not going after the government and taking them to task is shameful. I guess one downside of this documentary is them not giving a possible reason for the slaughter (though they say it might have something to do with the whimp factor cloud hanging over Bush at the time). Why did we do it? We could have gone in, nailed some of the Panamanian troops (I doubt they could have put up much resistance) and called it a day. Why did they do something so horrible?This is another dark, ugly shadow over the history of the United States. It shows that George Bush was no better than his wretched father and he passed that wretchedness on to Dubya. This needs to be seen by everyone. I have a cousin with a doctorate in journalism. She says (holding her hands 3 feet apart) we don't have freedom of the press.

333469,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,6302779545,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[7, 9]","This was, in many way, a groundbreaking documentary.  It starts out as the usual American government is corrupt thing.  While I believe this to be true (as all governments are corrupt in some way), the unique point about this documentary was that it pointed out the complicity of the mainstream media (MSM for short) in the invasion of Panama.  For all the right wing talk of a liberal media, when it comes down to military invasions, the American media lies down and obey any administration.  They kept silent during this operation, the Gulf War, the Kosovo war, and the current Iraq war.  CNN put up a ""Noreiga hotline"", which was hilarious.  Tom Brokaw was saying that Panamanians were acting like a bunch of ""goons"", which was comic book like.  Another telling incident is that the UN condemned the invasion, it barely got a mention at CBS, and it was completely ignored by NBC.  It was all so incredibly stupid and silly to see the media spin this war.  It isn't funny for all the civilians who died in Panama, though.  The filmmakers say this was done to shed Bush 41's ""wimp"" image, and to set the bar for The First Gulf War.  While this is debatable, there is no debate that the media obeyed and didn't ask a damn thing of its government.  Technically, the film was also innovative, as it was shot on video.  Most documentaries, if they were ever finished, were usually shot on 16mm.  This film was made when documentaries were rare.

The video makes some good points about Noriega's relationship with the US, but some of its conclusions, like invading Panama to continue a strong military presence in order to reduce response time to potential cocaine-cartel threats in Colombia, are wrong and were proven so by the handing over of the Canal to Panama in 1999, just as promised.The main idea I learned about this is to consider varying perspectives and to let time tell the real story.",3,Decent study of Inter-American Relations,1279152000,"07 15, 2010",2010,671,"['tough', 'write', 'review', 'event', 'never', 'seen', 'American', 'military', 'one', 'hand', 'were', 'there', 'were', 'forced', 'silence', 'American', 'public', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'there', 'could', 'only', 'guess', 'truth', 'video', 'good', 'points', 'Noriega', 'relationship', 'US', 'conclusions', 'invading', 'Panama', 'continue', 'strong', 'military', 'presence', 'order', 'reduce', 'response', 'time', 'potential', 'cocaine-cartel', 'threats', 'Colombia', 'are', 'wrong', 'were', 'proven', 'so', 'handing', 'Canal', 'Panama', '1999', 'just', 'promised.The', 'main', 'idea', 'learned', 'consider', 'varying', 'perspectives', 'let', 'time', 'tell', 'real', 'story']",N/A

I remember the buildup to this war being similar to the Gulf War a year later - a constant drumbeat of deception and propaganda from the media and government, the portrayal of a weak Third World dictator as a ""threat"" to Americans and world peace, the predictable talk of defending human rights and democracy.There are also allegations that the Pentagon tried out some exotic new weaponry on the citizens of Panama.
