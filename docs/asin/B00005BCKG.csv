580920,A2TLEB18074L4S,B00005BCKG,Alexander Leach,"[8, 11]","As a film lover who has despaired of seeing Jack Nicholson ever giving a fine performance again, I can happily report that his handling of the role of Jerry Black in this film is exceptionally fine.  Not that 'The Pledge' is a star vehicle, despite his name appearing over the title.The writers and director (Sean Penn) have crafted an excellent film which is part thriller, part psychological drama.  Nevada cop Jerry Black is only hours from retirement when he promises the mother of a murder victim that he will track down her young daughter's killer.  Over the next two hours we travel with him on a journey of uncertainty as he probes deeply into other related murders (despite the case being officially closed), and even in retirement comes uncomfortably close to another potential victim.The director and writers here wisely avoid two massive cliches that were waiting to happen, namely 'the weary cop striving to crack his last case before retirement', and 'the cop with a hunch failing to convince his sceptical superiors.'  They instead tell a very different story, which far from being depressing, is gripping and keeps the audience guessing until the final scenes.Sean Penn has done a superb job in involving the audience in this ultimately poignant and tragic film, and has been rewarded with wonderful performances from Nicholson, Robin Wright Penn, and several other famous actors in small but critical roles (hardly cameos, as their involvement is crucial to the plot).  These include fine parts for Helen Mirren, Vanessa Redgrave and Harry Dean Stanton, a superb performance from Mickey Rourke, and a bizarre one from Benicio del Toro, who is sadly underused.The DVD looks superb: a crystal clear and vivid anamorphic 2.35:1 image, which shows off the breathtaking photography of rural Nevada.  Virtually a state-of-the-art transfer, in fact. The use of the camera is very imaginative throughout, and the editing is crisply compelling.The sound is also excellent.  There are no explosions, car chases or shoot-outs in this film, so the soundtrack merely has to support the excellent dialogue and eclectic music score, and succeeds on every level.  Apart from the trailer and cast profiles there are no extras.Sean Penn has made an outstanding film, and with so much dross currently being released by Hollywood, I strongly recommend this DVD to all lovers of powerful cinema.",5,An engrossing and powerful drama,993254400,"06 23, 2001",2001,2391,"['film', 'lover', 'who', 'despaired', 'seeing', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'ever', 'giving', 'fine', 'performance', 'again', 'can', 'happily', 'report', 'handling', 'role', 'Jerry', 'Black', 'film', 'exceptionally', 'fine', 'Not', 'Pledge', 'star', 'vehicle', 'name', 'appearing', 'title.The', 'writers', 'director', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'have', 'crafted', 'excellent', 'film', 'part', 'thriller', 'part', 'psychological', 'drama', 'Nevada', 'cop', 'Jerry', 'Black', 'only', 'hours', 'retirement', 'when', 'mother', 'murder', 'victim', 'will', 'track', 'down', 'young', 'daughter', 'killer', 'next', 'two', 'hours', 'travel', 'journey', 'uncertainty', 'deeply', 'other', 'related', 'murders', 'case', 'being', 'officially', 'closed', 'even', 'retirement', 'uncomfortably', 'close', 'potential', 'victim.The', 'director', 'writers', 'here', 'wisely', 'avoid', 'two', 'massive', 'cliches', 'were', 'waiting', 'happen', 'namely', 'weary', 'cop', 'striving', 'crack', 'last', 'case', 'retirement', 'cop', 'hunch', 'failing', 'convince', 'sceptical', 'superiors', 'instead', 'tell', 'very', 'different', 'story', 'far', 'being', 'depressing', 'gripping', 'audience', 'guessing', 'final', 'scenes.Sean', 'Penn', 'done', 'superb', 'job', 'involving', 'audience', 'ultimately', 'poignant', 'tragic', 'film', 'been', 'rewarded', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Nicholson', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'several', 'other', 'famous', 'actors', 'small', 'critical', 'roles', 'hardly', 'cameos', 'involvement', 'crucial', 'plot', 'include', 'fine', 'parts', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'superb', 'performance', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'bizarre', 'one', 'Benicio', 'del', 'Toro', 'who', 'sadly', 'underused.The', 'DVD', 'superb', 'crystal', 'clear', 'vivid', 'anamorphic', '2.35:1', 'image', 'breathtaking', 'photography', 'rural', 'Nevada', 'Virtually', 'state-of-the-art', 'transfer', 'fact', 'use', 'camera', 'very', 'imaginative', 'editing', 'crisply', 'compelling.The', 'sound', 'also', 'excellent', 'are', 'explosions', 'car', 'chases', 'shoot-outs', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'merely', 'support', 'excellent', 'dialogue', 'eclectic', 'music', 'score', 'level', 'Apart', 'trailer', 'cast', 'profiles', 'are', 'extras.Sean', 'Penn', 'made', 'outstanding', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'dross', 'currently', 'being', 'released', 'Hollywood', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'lovers', 'powerful', 'cinema']",N/A

580924,A1IBC9XP2LICQL,B00005BCKG,A. Wolverton,"[10, 15]","'The Pledge' is not a typical murder mystery or a typical Jack Nicholson movie.  Nicholson plays a Reno, Nevada cop named Black who decides to get involved in one last case literally during the middle of his retirement party.  Making a promise to find a little girl's murderer, Black begins a journey that leads him down a dark road of desperation and obsession.I can't remember seeing Nicholson play a character that was this uncertain since 'The King of Marvin Gardens.'  The only thing about Black that is certain is his obsession to find the &quot;giant&quot; who is killing little girls.  Nicholson's carefully controlled performance is, as usual, first-rate.  The inner conflict between seeking justice and placing a family at risk is played very well by Nicholson and director Penn.  The supporting cast is generally good, but too much talent is wasted.  Vanessa Redgrave appears in only one brief scene...Harry Dean Stanton does nothing beyond selling his gas station...Benicio Del Toro is gripping while on-screen, but he's not on for long.  Yet, the short screen-time by the supporting cast is probably not what bothers most viewers...it's the conclusion.Without giving away the ending, I can say two things:1 - It works, in its own way2 - It didn't leave me satisfiedI understand the ending, and I can see how the events of the film progress to it, but I was disappointed.  Penn sets up the film well, but everything leading up to the ending leads the audience to believe that their expectations are going to be met.  They aren't, or at least they weren't for me.  Again, I understand and appreciate the ending, it just wasn't what Penn prepared us for.  In the film's favor, I was glad that this was not a strict formula picture.  There's a lot to consider when the film is playing and there's a lot to think about after it's over.

580927,ALR35EFI69S5R,B00005BCKG,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[28, 32]","There is much to recommend in this complex and deeply layered psychological thriller featuring Jack Nicholson in what seems to have evolved into a continuing exploration into the dark side of human nature in his roles over the last decade. This is a gorgeously photographed and quite penetrating drama which on one level involves Nicholson as a dogged, troubled, and obsessed retired detective convinced the actual killer of his last gruesome juvenile homocide case is still at large, while on another level it is a stunning and all-too graphic portrait of what such single-minded concentration can do to a fragile and vulnerable personality. While it is not a movie I would recommend to the faint of heart, it is an absorbing exploration into this character's heart of darkness and the perils associated with such risky adventures.The movie is set supposedly in Reno and the surrounding Sierras, and the natural scenery that provides the stage for this drama is simply breath taking, and is worth the viewing experience for this experience alone. I was, however, disappointed to discover by viewing the end credits that the movie was largely shot in western Canada. Wherever it was filmed, the scenery provides a curious backdrop to the ugliness and sordidness of human beings, and how their own experiences and personalities blind them to the beauty in others around them. Each has been branded by the character and limitations of his or her own reservoir of emotional experiences, and each is consequently sent spinning toward a seemingly irrevocable tendency to make snap conclusions about complex realities as a result.Thus Nicholson is caught in the dilemma of not only his own troubles, but in the easy answers others have in attributin ghis actions and behavior to other motives and problems. Thus Robin Wright Penn, Mickey Rourke, Sam Shepard, Vanessa Redgrave, Harry Dean Stanton and a number of notable others blithely (and sometimes painfully) slip past the rather remarkable qualities in Nicholson's character as well as in Wright Penn's memorable turn as a woman with battered background and a beautiful little girl who lights up the screen and who also just happens to exactly fit Nicholson's bogeyman serial killer's profile.Thus, his motives for the subsequent involvement are confused at best, yet he seems to genuinely care for the new family he adopts along the way. With this, the stage is set for potential tragedy, and while I found the conclusion emotionally and dramatically unpleasing, it was admittedly indeed in the scope of the characters and circumstance to have it so ended. I recommend this, but also caution against letting one's impressionable children watch this. Like ""Silence Of The Lambs"" or ""Seven"", this is hardly juvenile entertainment.

I love Jack Nicholson and saw this film as an undiscovered gem. The story of a retired cop out to get an extremely violent pedophile murderer pulled me in and kept me riveted through many scenes, but in some of them, Penn spent so much time on atmosphere, camera angles, and the scenery, that I found myself getting a little annoyed, and this killed the build up that he was obviously aiming for, but failed to deliver. I believe the film would have been better paced and less frustrating to watch at times if Penn cut 30 minutes from it. This wouldn't have made this movie any less powerful because the writer's hold their cards very close to their chest, pulling each one out very discretely, and only when they have you begging for more information. This created a good measure of suspense for me, but as I mentioned, the excessive time trailing after each punch - instead off winding up for the next one, deflated what should have been much better film.

The case is closed but, now retired, Black is not convinced that they found the right man. He then begins an odyssey to find who he believes is the REAL killer. He relocates to an area where other murders of young girls have occurred and starts a new life. He meets a young woman named Laurie, (Robin Wright), who has a young daughter, and begins a relationship with her. The ultimate question of the movie is, in the end which will be stronger, Jerry's feelings for Laurie and her daughter or the deep seeded promise he made to the murdered girl's mother. The first keeps him grounded and secure and the second slowly drains him of his soul and his sanity. This psychological crime drama has one of the best group of supporting actors in film today. I have never seen such a great ensemble of actors put together in smaller budget film and their acting really bolsters the credibility of the story. The cinematography is also gorgeous especially the scenes of winter in the western U.S.. The only flaw I can see is in the screenplay which lack the necessary fluidity for this type of film. The story of Jerry's slow descent into madness, is not developed as well as it should be and that makes the film a bit choppy.

He used a first rate novel, written by the late  Friedrich D&uuml;rrenmatt, and adapted by first rate screenwriters Jerzy Kromolowski and Mary Olson-Kromolowski. It shows.  The writing is complex and finely nuanced, taking no predictible Hollywood plot or character turns. The film is also highly artistic. Actors must love to work for Penn because he obtained the very best for even single scene roles. As retiring police detective Jerry Black, Nicholson is pulled into one last case and pledges to a grieving mother that he will find her daughter's killer.  This sets him off on a long, obsessive course of action to trap this killer.  He has an incredible amount of patience in setting his lure, much like his favorite avocation, fishing, requires of its followers.  This also sets in motion his using and manipulating other people, particularly a single mother and her daughter, which heightens the tension considerably.  Robin Wright Penn does her usual first class acting job as that single mother.  Perhaps the most startling performance in the whole film is Benicio del Toro as a mentally handicapped Indian the police believe is the killer.  Del Toro may have quite an acting future ahead if this performance is any indication of the range of his ability.  He even outdoes his &quot;Traffic&quot; performance.

In Friedrich Durrenmatt's rich and suggestive novel 'the Pledge', Sean Penn could have chosen from:  a tense detective story about a child-killer; a deconstruction of detective stories (and narrative itself), its assumptions, methods and iconography; a study of mental breakdown, the limits of reason in a rational society, and of a man who has lived a long professional life and begins to wonder what it all meant; a portrait of a rural community and its relationship to a bureaucratic, indifferent urban centre; the terrible fears, in a regimented, air-brushed, famously peaceful and neutral country, of madness, criminality and violence; the obstacles of Absurdity and Chance scuppering all man's progress.By virtue of filming the novel, Penn touches on most of these subjects, but doesn't really seem interested in any of them.  It's not that he needs to be rigorously faithful to the book - indeed, the more faithful a literary adaptation, the duller it usually is.  Durrenmatt's novel itself was a reworking of a much more conventional screenplay he wrote for a Swiss film, so he knew what was or wasn't possible in the cinema.  But this 'Pledge' lacks focus.  If I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't have been able to follow the film half the time.Penn isn't remotely interested in the crime genre - not only does this give the film a sluggish pace, but the whole idea of a detective losing the one thing that defines his status and power (his mind) lacks the emotional resonance you get in, say, 'Touch of Evil' or 'Vertigo'.  Penn, casting Sam Shepherd and Harry Dean Stanton is clearly trying to create a kind of mythic American epic like 'Paris Texas' (whose narrative he bleakly reverses), but what's he saying?  what are we supposed to feel or recognise?  There are occasionally interesting sequences (such as the interrogation of the Indian like the sexual abuse he's been accused of).  The symbolism is heavy-handed, and the performances from an amazing cast are uniformly atrocious, with the exceptions of Aaron Eckhart and Stanton.

The bully cop who'll do anything for a confession.  The cast is pure stock and trade stuff; in fact, we see much of this again in ""Mystic River."" It seems Penn's bag of tricks was found in the wardrobe department at RKO. There is nothing of interest in the narrative. He seems to have a thing for men protecting little girls from death.

I knew &quot;The Pledge&quot; was a bomb when a couple of viewers  in different parts of the theater remarked on how lousy it was.  The film left the Houston area about one week later headed for box office oblivion.  Sean Penn made a  horrible mistake in in keeping secret the identity of the sex deviate.  This was frustrating to say the least and made the rest of the film seem pointless.  Jack Nicholson  did a good job as the alcoholic retired detective who pledges to a mother that he will find the killer of her daughter.  However, Penn has Nicholson play the role of Jerry Black in such a  manner as to suggest that the police officer committed himself to the case not so much as to solve it, but because the man has nothing better to do.  Nicholson's  character comes across as an existentially challenged individual who needs to find a purpose to make his life worth living.  The murdered girl is merely an excuse to  justifying getting up in the morning.Penn's real life wife Robin Wright Penn is very convincing as the mother who accepts the generosity of the much older retired officer.  Initially she seeks only a  relationship which will secure a loving home for the young girl.  A sort of romance soon develops between the two adults which seems only to bewilder and  overwhelm the man.  Wasn't the recent Academy Award winner Benico Del Toro, you might ask,  also in the movie?  Del Toro merely has about a five minute part  indulging in histrionic mannerisms as a mentally retarded man falsely suspected of a vile crime.  Penn essentially wasted this great actor's enormous talent. The other  actors do little to balance out the deficiencies of Penn's directing.I can give &quot;The Pledge&quot; only two stars.  Only the true fans of Jack Nicholson will find it worth viewing.  The previously mentioned &quot;The Cold Light of Day,&quot; though,  is highly recommended (four stars) as a something of a hidden gem.  Rudolf Van Den Berg aptly directs this virtually unknown movie in an intelligent and exciting  manner.  The audience actually gets to understanding the sick motivations of the child killer. Van Berg's direction is not pretentious, and he accomplishes a lot with  almost certainly a smaller budget.

In &quot;The Pledge&quot; Nicholson plays a detective on the eve of retirement who makes a promise to catch the killer of a brutally murdered young girl.  His subseqent investigation yields a string of similar murders, convincing Nicholson that he is dealing with a serial killer that has gone undetected until now.  However, Nicholson's belief is based more on gut feeling than on hard-core proof, and his colleagues at the police station he used to work at comment to each other sadly that he is losing his mind. Nicholson's faith in the much younger Penn's direction is remarkable to behold.  One would assume that Nicholson would be wary of putting so much of his reputation into Penn's young, and relatively new to directing, hands.  But Penn does a marvelous job and constructs a wonderfully developed film that utilizes Nicholson's patented sneers and onscreen orneryness to perfection. This movie's greatest attribute is that it keeps you guessing.  There are many false paths thrown in just in anticipation of clever audience members who have seen this type of drama many times before.  With such a well-worked storyline, it would be easy for &quot;The Pledge&quot; to fall into cliche', but instead, it uses the cliches to lure you into a false sense of security before pulling the rug out from under your feet. This is a movie that is definatly worth a look, mainly for Nicholson's performance and Penn's direction, but also for small parts by Robin Wright Penn (looking as unglamourous as possible) and Mickey Rourke (who steals the show in about a two minute monologue).

Those who really love it because it's so different and those who disliked it because it was so different.  In other words what it comes down to is a movie that is so different that depending on what you are expecting, it may or may not please you.Before I go into my personal feelings of the movie, I will have to agree that Nicholson's performance of the retiring police officer was good.  Many people wonder if the man can continue to do a stellar performance and it's evident that no matter how old Nicholson is, he will always be a talented actor.  What I disagree with is this film being one of his prized performances and movies.Second, I agree that Sean Penn did very well as a director in this movie, the cinematography was indeed beautiful but unfortunately a stellar performance, good directing, good music and good cinematography cannot make a great movie with a storyline that leaves you feeling empty and making you say &quot;Is that it?&quot;This movie will go in my list of reviews of movies with strong potential but with a purpose to be different that will attract some moviegoers but more than likely will alienate people.  In this list are movies such as &quot;Arlington Road&quot; and &quot;Juliet in Love&quot;.As with my review of &quot;Arlington Road&quot;, I give the the movie credit for being different and for having an ending so unlike what many people would expect but does being different mean good?  Perhaps to some people.  Some people found &quot;Arlington Road&quot; brilliant.  Some people found &quot;The Pledge&quot; brilliant because both movies are different.  Not me.As for the DVD, video and audio is good.  The music sounds good but this is more of a dialogue film, so it's not one of those that you will expect to be testing out your receiver.

580948,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00005BCKG,Dennis Littrell,"[11, 11]","The ending of this movie, of which we see glimpses in the beginning, is an example of the sort of cosmic irony that some world-renown writers apply to human affairs.  It is not the sort of thing usually seen in a movie of course, since the mass mind at which most movies are directed will find it dissatisfying, even irritating.The world-renowned author responsible for the ending of this tale of a retired cop on the trail of a serial killer of blond little girls in red dresses is none other than Swiss novelist and playwright Friedrich D&uuml;rrenmatt who wrote the novel from which the screen play was adapted.The ""pledge"" in the title is that of just-retiring Reno, Nevada cop Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) who is not convinced that a confession by a mentally-disturbed Native American, played convincingly by Benicio Del Toro, is genuine.  Jerry Black gives his word to the mother of the murdered little girl that he will find the killer.  However, he is no longer on the force and gets only intermittent help from his colleagues who think he has gone a little daffy.  Nicholson, as usual, totally becomes the character he is playing and gives an outstanding performance.  He is assisted by Aaron Eckhart who plays the detective who got the ""confession,"" and by Robin Wright Penn who plays Lori, the mother of another little girl.The direction by Sean Penn is uncluttered, focused and visually astute.  For example, note the way the little girl playing in the swings between the highway and the gas station affects our expectation of what is to come.  Penn also captures well the high country atmosphere around Reno, Nevada and attendant lifestyles, and for the most part keeps his auteur ambitions secondary to the telling of the story.  The script by Jerzy Kromolowski and Mary Olson-Kromolowski is artistically true with crisp, direct dialogue and a fine dramatic structure.  The film is also nicely cut so that everything is clear without any belaboring of the obvious.  Some of the set scenes as Jerry Black interviews the grandmother of the slain little girl (Vanessa Redgrave in a cameo) and then a psychiatrist (..., who is just perfect in her experienced skepticism) are very well done.  Most importantly though, Penn did not give in to those who would demand a commercial ending over an artistic one.  And for this he paid the price, since this film was not well-received by the mass audience.Of course it is impossible to discuss the ending without giving away too much, but I think we can safely say that in real life sometimes chance and fate (if you will) step in and change things dramatically which makes us see our limitations and realize that some of what happens to us is beyond our control.  I think that is what happened to Jerry Black and Lori; yet notice, too, that it is integral to Jerry Black's character and all that he has been all his life for him to make the insensitive mistake that he does.Incidentally the ending can be fixed in a sequel...  Well, that is not likely to happen since this was NOT a box office success.  Only box office successes get to be sequels--which somehow (bizarrely) reminds me of the line from the old Charlie the Tuna TV commercial: ""Only good-tasting tunas get to be Starkist.""For those who are wondering who really did kill the little girls, I will give you a hint: he got his just deserts in a symbolically appropriate manner.Bottom line: a fine artistic achievement, an excellent diversion, and a treat for those who are fed up with films that play out in a tiresome, predictable manner.",5,"Unpredictable thriller, beautifully realized",1095811200,"09 22, 2004",2004,3554,"['ending', 'movie', 'see', 'glimpses', 'beginning', 'example', 'sort', 'cosmic', 'irony', 'world-renown', 'writers', 'apply', 'human', 'affairs', 'not', 'sort', 'thing', 'usually', 'seen', 'movie', 'course', 'mass', 'mind', 'most', 'movies', 'are', 'directed', 'will', 'find', 'dissatisfying', 'even', 'irritating.The', 'world-renowned', 'author', 'responsible', 'ending', 'tale', 'retired', 'cop', 'trail', 'serial', 'killer', 'blond', 'little', 'girls', 'red', 'dresses', 'none', 'other', 'Swiss', 'novelist', 'playwright', 'Friedrich', 'D', 'uuml', 'rrenmatt', 'who', 'wrote', 'novel', 'screen', 'play', 'was', 'adapted.The', 'pledge', 'title', 'just-retiring', 'Reno', 'Nevada', 'cop', 'Jerry', 'Black', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'who', 'not', 'convinced', 'confession', 'mentally-disturbed', 'Native', 'American', 'played', 'convincingly', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'genuine', 'Jerry', 'Black', 'word', 'mother', 'murdered', 'little', 'girl', 'will', 'find', 'killer', 'However', 'no', 'longer', 'force', 'only', 'intermittent', 'help', 'colleagues', 'who', 'think', 'gone', 'little', 'daffy', 'Nicholson', 'usual', 'totally', 'character', 'playing', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'assisted', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'who', 'detective', 'who', 'got', 'confession', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'who', 'Lori', 'mother', 'little', 'girl.The', 'direction', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'uncluttered', 'focused', 'visually', 'astute', 'example', 'note', 'way', 'little', 'girl', 'playing', 'swings', 'highway', 'gas', 'station', 'expectation', 'what', 'come', 'Penn', 'also', 'well', 'high', 'country', 'atmosphere', 'Reno', 'Nevada', 'attendant', 'lifestyles', 'most', 'part', 'auteur', 'ambitions', 'secondary', 'telling', 'story', 'script', 'Jerzy', 'Kromolowski', 'Mary', 'Olson-Kromolowski', 'artistically', 'true', 'crisp', 'direct', 'dialogue', 'fine', 'dramatic', 'structure', 'film', 'also', 'nicely', 'cut', 'so', 'everything', 'clear', 'belaboring', 'obvious', 'set', 'scenes', 'Jerry', 'Black', 'grandmother', 'slain', 'little', 'girl', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'cameo', 'then', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'just', 'perfect', 'experienced', 'skepticism', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Most', 'importantly', 'Penn', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'who', 'would', 'demand', 'commercial', 'ending', 'artistic', 'one', 'paid', 'price', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'well-received', 'mass', 'audience.Of', 'course', 'impossible', 'discuss', 'ending', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'think', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'real', 'life', 'sometimes', 'chance', 'fate', 'will', 'step', 'change', 'things', 'dramatically', 'see', 'limitations', 'realize', 'what', 'control', 'think', 'what', 'happened', 'Jerry', 'Black', 'Lori', 'yet', 'notice', 'too', 'integral', 'Jerry', 'Black', 'character', 'been', 'life', 'make', 'insensitive', 'mistake', 'does.Incidentally', 'ending', 'can', 'be', 'fixed', 'sequel', 'Well', 'not', 'likely', 'happen', 'was', 'NOT', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'Only', 'box', 'office', 'successes', 'get', 'be', 'sequels', 'somehow', 'bizarrely', 'line', 'old', 'Charlie', 'Tuna', 'TV', 'commercial', 'Only', 'good-tasting', 'tunas', 'get', 'be', 'Starkist', 'who', 'are', 'wondering', 'who', 'really', 'did', 'kill', 'little', 'girls', 'will', 'give', 'hint', 'got', 'just', 'deserts', 'symbolically', 'appropriate', 'manner.Bottom', 'line', 'fine', 'artistic', 'achievement', 'excellent', 'diversion', 'treat', 'who', 'are', 'fed', 'up', 'films', 'play', 'out', 'tiresome', 'predictable', 'manner']",N/A

580955,A18CA0GRHDVP8X,B00005BCKG,Earl Hazell,"[12, 16]","There is a scene about twenty minutes into the film where Jack Nicholson's character, a detective literally about to retire, elects to tell the unsuspecting parents of young girl that she has been the victim of a brutal murder. The parents own a chicken coup. The camera work of the inside of the coup, with the chickens, each seemingly walking around in his/her own world until some unexpected sound or vibration grabs their attention and they notice one another, is poetry of the highest order. A chicken is picked out from amongst the crowd by the neck and looked at. This one will make a fine roast, you can almost hear the person picking it up saying to themselves.The scene is sublime poetry because for the brief moments the chickens are focused on they seem to take on human characteristics...it's as if you are staring at the collective personality of a busy street corner in New York during rush hour. And the picking of one chicken (who will of course disappear, never to be seen again), which may be the product of careful study, etc. seems to be, coming from the other chickens' point of view, completely random--and simultaneously incomprehensible.This scene is the entire movie encapsulated. It carries with it the incomprehensible pain of being human in a world routinely struck by what seems on the surface to be the random acts of an incomprehensible violence, but, like a chaos theory, has its own sad, hidden and inhumane logic lodged deep within.Sean Penn's directing in this film is a triumph on many levels. Jack Nicholson's work of trying to catch a serial killer--and losing himself in the process--is superior. And yet as many others have said, the character work of others is equally compelling, making this masterful ensemble film a profound experience: Benicio del Toro as a mentally ill Native American whose mind is weak, but whose broken heart full of regret and fear is acute; Mickey Rourke as a grieving father has one scene in the entire movie that is Oscar worthy; Robin Wright Penn makes you completely forget there are any actors in this movie at all.And the screenplay stands toe to toe with them all and becomes part of the masterful ensemble. Nicholson says to his old boss in one scene ""I made a promise...you're old enough to remember when that meant something."" And yet the entire movie stands as a testament to the complicated nature of human existence that makes it obvious some promises were made to be broken.A profound movie that is a great work of art.",4,"A heartbreaking work of grief, fear, suspense and uncompromising beauty",1145059200,"04 15, 2006",2006,2502,"['scene', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'where', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'detective', 'literally', 'retire', 'elects', 'tell', 'unsuspecting', 'parents', 'young', 'girl', 'been', 'victim', 'brutal', 'murder', 'parents', 'own', 'chicken', 'coup', 'camera', 'work', 'inside', 'coup', 'chickens', 'seemingly', 'walking', 'around', 'own', 'world', 'unexpected', 'sound', 'vibration', 'grabs', 'attention', 'notice', 'one', 'poetry', 'highest', 'order', 'chicken', 'picked', 'crowd', 'neck', 'looked', 'one', 'will', 'make', 'fine', 'roast', 'can', 'almost', 'hear', 'person', 'picking', 'up', 'saying', 'themselves.The', 'scene', 'sublime', 'poetry', 'brief', 'moments', 'chickens', 'are', 'focused', 'seem', 'take', 'human', 'characteristics', 'are', 'staring', 'collective', 'personality', 'busy', 'street', 'corner', 'New', 'York', 'rush', 'hour', 'picking', 'one', 'chicken', 'who', 'will', 'course', 'disappear', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'may', 'be', 'product', 'careful', 'study', 'etc', 'be', 'coming', 'other', 'chickens', 'point', 'view', 'completely', 'random', 'simultaneously', 'incomprehensible.This', 'scene', 'entire', 'movie', 'encapsulated', 'incomprehensible', 'pain', 'being', 'human', 'world', 'routinely', 'struck', 'what', 'surface', 'be', 'random', 'acts', 'incomprehensible', 'violence', 'chaos', 'theory', 'own', 'sad', 'hidden', 'inhumane', 'logic', 'lodged', 'deep', 'within.Sean', 'Penn', 'directing', 'film', 'triumph', 'many', 'levels', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'work', 'trying', 'catch', 'serial', 'killer', 'losing', 'process', 'superior', 'yet', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'character', 'work', 'others', 'equally', 'compelling', 'making', 'masterful', 'ensemble', 'film', 'profound', 'experience', 'Benicio', 'del', 'Toro', 'mentally', 'ill', 'Native', 'American', 'mind', 'weak', 'broken', 'heart', 'full', 'regret', 'fear', 'acute', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'grieving', 'father', 'one', 'scene', 'entire', 'movie', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'completely', 'forget', 'are', 'actors', 'movie', 'screenplay', 'toe', 'toe', 'part', 'masterful', 'ensemble', 'Nicholson', 'old', 'boss', 'one', 'scene', 'made', 'promise', ""'re"", 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'when', 'meant', 'something', 'yet', 'entire', 'movie', 'testament', 'complicated', 'nature', 'human', 'existence', 'obvious', 'promises', 'were', 'made', 'be', 'broken.A', 'profound', 'movie', 'great', 'work', 'art']",N/A

580958,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00005BCKG,"""flickjunkie""","[0, 1]","Sean Penn's third directorial project portends a promising future behind the camera.  Despite having to overcome a somewhat flawed screenplay, Penn shows talent at creating a textured character study with some wonderful photography thrown in.  While the film drew criticism for its deliberate pace, every scene adds another brushstroke to the human canvas and develops the characters richly.  This film is not an action adventure thriller, and it was never intended to be.  The only criticism I have of Penn's direction is his failure to rectify a number of plot flaws (such as the gas station transaction which was ridiculously unbelievable).The story follows Detective Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson), who on the day of his retirement from the police force is called in to help solve one more case involving the murder of a little girl.  When the case is closed after a confession is coerced out of a simpleton, Jerry is not convinced.  He made a pledge to the victim's mother to find the killer and he doesn't feel that he is being true to that pledge.  So, he buys a gas station in the area he suspects that the killer resides and does a little investigating from within the community.Penn keeps the film intriguing, giving us subtle clues that cast suspicion on numerous characters as possible murder suspects.  At one point I even thought the murderer might have been Jerry.  Ultimately the murderer is revealed, but the ending is unsatisfying, leaving the viewer without the vindication of seeing him properly brought to justice.Nicholson is at his moody and sardonic best in this film.  He has an innate ability to play the complex and offbeat character to perfection, always believable despite being on the fringe of mental instability.  Robin Wright Penn takes an unglamorous role portraying a hard working lower class mother and gives a tremendous performance.  Aaron Eckhart is obnoxious and unbelievable as detective Stan Krolak, but Benicio Del Toro is outstanding as the simple minded Toby, who gets pinned with the murder because he was seen in the area.This is a good film with a mediocre story and a promising outing for Penn.  I rated it a 7/10.

The second filming was as COLD LIGHT OF DAY, with Richard E Grant, 1996.  In both of those film versions we see the killer caught, but not in any shootout, but rather in a way that the child &#34;bait&#34; for the killer is spared any anguish, and her sensibilities are not damaged.  I highly recommend seeing those two and skipping THE PLEDGE,  the third filming.  Here we see a completely chaotic ending with a confused, traumatized child who loses the closet thing to a father in Nicholson, who ends up  a drunk mindlessly babbling at the end, alone and completely broken, his  reputation with his former colleges destroyed, and the mother of the &#34;bait&#34; child turned in to one who was formerly battered, ending up the batterer of Nicholson!  I tell you, folks, wacky Hollywood has done it again.  Totally trashed, mashed and otherwise wasted the albeit great performances by the actors involved in this convoluted sequel.  As a completest, I will keep all three, but THE PLEDGE will not be viewed last (and best, like other sequels), the next time I watch them.

A killer that has a distinct taste for little girls. **Possible Spoiler** But everyone thinks the killer is dead, except Nicholsons character.  So after his (semi)retirement, he goes in search of the killer, in a low key fashion.  He befriends a pitiful lady played by Robin Wright Penn.  She does very well herself.  She has a daughter, that fits that distinct taste for young girls the killer has.  The story unfolds from there.  It's not  your typical cat & mouse movie.

580974,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00005BCKG,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 1]","The Pledge opens with Detective Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) mumbling to himself and begins to unfold in flashback. On the eve of Jerry's retirement, a young girl is found murdered in a small, neighboring town. With a few hours remaining until he's officially retired, Jerry accompanies the police to the crime scene. The local police do not wish to tell the parents, forcing Jerry to deliver the news himself.It's this scene that reveals The Pledge to be more than a police procedural or murder-mystery. Jerry arrives at the parents' home, a turkey farm and the camera is kept far away and static while we see (but don't hear) Jerry tell them about their daughter. The girl's mother (Patricia Clarkson) asks Jerry to promise to find her daughter's killer and he hesitantly pledges that he will. Hours later, a mentally retarded Indian (Benicio Del Toro) is fingered as the killer and kills himself moments after a confession is coaxed out of him by a young, cocky detective (Aaron Eckhart). Officially, the case is closed but Jerry doesn't believe it and ditches a planned vacation trip and begins interviewing relatives of the girl, discovering similar unsolved murders in the area. Despite compelling evidence, his former co-workers in the department ignore him. Jerry continues his search, buying a gas station he is sure the killer will pass through and becoming involved with Lori (Robin Wright), a waitress whose daughter resembles the murder victims.This is the third film directed by Sean Penn and his second collaboration with Jack Nicholson after The Crossing Guard. Aside from being one of Hollywood's greatest actors, Penn also shows himself to be a confident and talented director. Both films he's made with Nicholson portray driven, but deeply flawed individuals on a quest to do what they believe is right, with deep psychological urges dictating their moves. At face value, The Pledge sells itself as a murder-mystery with the familiar motif of a retired cop on one last case and indeed, it plays like one too. It's actually a character study hiding behind the veil of a murder mystery and it is complex enough that you may not be aware of this until the final scene.The script by Jerzy Kromolowski and Mary Olson-Kromolowski (based on a novella by Friedrich D&uuml;rrenmatt) wisely avoids spoon-feeding information to the audience. It sets up scenarios but allows you to draw your own conclusions about what they represent. When Jerry meets Lori and her daughter Chrissy, we realize that she resembles the murdered girls and when Jerry asks them to move in with him, we're left to decide whether his charity masks something more ominous.Penn underplays everything and never allows The Pledge to descend into spectacle. There's nothing flashy about the film and Penn (along with his cinematographer Chris Menges) creates a subtle miasma that complements the intelligent subtlety of the script. After only three films, he's a remarkably assured director that very quietly led his film into places that mainstream films hardly dare to venture.Made on a fairly small budget, The Pledge is peppered with familiar faces filling out the supporting roles. The recognizable ones include Tom Noonan, Helen Mirren, Vanessa Redgrave, Mickey Rourke, Harry Dean Stanton, and Sam Shepard. With so many well-known actors, it'd be easy to distract the audience from the core story but Penn found a way (however unintentional it may have been) to make their presence work. Because their roles are so small and the actors are often immediately identifiable, it allows us to more quickly focus on what the purpose of the scene is rather than trying to unravel some mystery about their characters in our heads. The Pledge is a master class of acting from all involved. Tom Noonan as a mysterious preacher has the rare quality of seeming like the nicest, yet creepiest man which makes his character intriguingly mysterious. He was an inspired, though obvious choice for this part. The old homily ""big things come in small packages"" is a perfect description for Rourke's small part as the father of a missing girl. With barely over a minute of screen time, Rourke delivers an emotional monologue that is heartbreaking and unforgettable. This was at a low-point in his career and should've been enough to warrant a comeback opportunity that he wouldn't see materialize until several years later.Then of course there's Jack Nicholson, one of our greatest living actors. Despite such an eclectic and mesmerizing body of work, Nicholson has always had a persona that he injects into his roles. His performance as Jerry Black probably strays the farthest from that persona and shows Nicholson as his most subdued. It may also be his most tragic character, with Nicholson giving a devastating portrayal of a man driven by his own compulsions and insecurities to do the right thing, even if it costs him his sanity. It's a haunting performance.I first saw the film nearly five years ago and I vividly recall how frustrated I was by it. I watched it again almost immediately after and my frustration remained. The reason for this is the same reason that will make-or-break the film for many people; the ending. The film enjoyed a wide release, but not commercial success. This ending is why. It's surprising, shocking, and initially very unsatisfying. I admit that it wasn't until seeing it twice that I even fully understood what had happened. This is a film that demands your attention. For me, I've never minded ambiguous endings but I perceived this ending to have such a profound lack of closure I was actually angry. Returning to the film some years later, my perception has changed. The film is a character study, not a murder-mystery and the ending does justice to that intent. It was a brave move for Penn to use it, as it's one of the most surprising, hopeless, and un-Hollywood endings I've seen in years. It defies audience expectation and will frustrate many who see it, but few will argue that it is unforgettable.This is an unforgettable, hopeless, and haunting film that boasts one of Jack Nicholson's finest performances.  It's not a perfect film; there are some areas that could've benefited from more depth and it could've tapped into Jerry's psychological urges a bit more, but it left a remarkable (and admittedly unfavorable) impression on me five years ago and I hadn't forgotten about it since. Revisiting it, it's one of those films that failed to garner much attention and now languishes in the annals of great, forgotten films just begging for re-examination and a re-birth. I assure you The Pledge is a masterpiece, albeit a forgotten one.",5,"A Masterpiece, Albeit a Forgotten One",1341360000,"07 4, 2012",2012,6654,"['Pledge', 'Detective', 'Jerry', 'Black', 'Jack',

There is action in this film but it's more about a good man that will do anything to live up to the promise that he has made.Jerry Black (played magnificantly by Jack Nickolson) is on the trail of a killer that has brutally murdered an innocent young girl. He makes a &quot;Pledge&quot; to the mother of the victim to find the murderer and you can tell that when Black makes a promise he keeps it.When watching this film, keep an open mind. Unlike many other movies a formalaic script does not exsist here. This film is a study of real life and the pain that goes along with trying ones best and having the results not come out the way one hoped (tragically portrayed in the last 3rd of this film).Many stars make cameo appearances which is nice to see but these cameos aren't just for show, they all contribute to the film's success. Everyone is so believable that you find yourself not &quot;star hunting&quot; but losing yourself in the brilliant acting performances.This movie will make you mad. This movie will make you upset.

580979,AMAWA346T2D3L,B00005BCKG,"Le Stryge ""in OZ""","[0, 0]","I bought this movie on the seemingly large numbers of positive reviews here and the apparently well known cast.I have to say first up that I was MAJORLY disappointed.It starts off well enough with a quite interesting premise being set up, and although you probably surmise exactly where it's going, things seem promising and you sit back for the story to develop.WHICH IT DOESN'T!!!After the introduction, that particular storyline is abandoned, or just put on hold,  and instead you get another movie altogether.It's one about Jack Nicholson's retirement to some backwoodsian lakeside shanty-town where he joins the local-yokels, buys a run down roadside store and devotes himself to fishing.(Some of the aforementioned mouth-breathing , intellectually deprived inhabitants shown on-screen just HAVE to be genuine examples of why it's not a good idea for families to repeatedly allow brother/sister marriages! It can't all be make-up surely?)Actually , you too will probably realise that SO many of the cast seem to be severely intellectually dis-abled for some reason. Why? Are they all in-bred out in the woods in America? Or were they just cheap to hire as extras?The first murder suspect; the inmates of some sort of mental facility; the owner of a Christmas store; the daughter of the owner of the gas station; not to mention the patrons of the local bar. All of them appear to be quite obviously mentally challenged for some odd reason. The average I.Q. of the whole town wouldn't be over single digits!After Jack blows a motsa of his retirement fund for the highly dubious business opportunity of the hick gas station, it's ONE word from then on folks, ...just the one!SLOW !!!Maybe that should be written....S..........L...........O................W.....?The performances are good enough, ...with the possible exception of the Chief of Police who thinks he's a comic, and he becomes quite irritating very early on.The cinematography itself is probably the best thing about the whole movie, but the artfully composed shots, and slick travelling pans just can't starve off  boredom, which is an ever-present threat of setting in. Permanently!The co-incidences and absolutely pathetically weak ""red-herrings"" thrown in here are far more plentiful than any fish Jack Nicholson manages to catch in the lake!SO OBVIOUS!The movie even resorts to visually shocking, but totally FAKE, very quickly seen scenarios a couple of times to try to elicit at least some interest, but as they are immediately then shown to be only ""imaginings"", it's back to the old ennui. Just more of the plodding tale of Old Jack's attempts at playing ""Happy Families"" with the child of some battered ex-wife pickup who's half his age. (THAT last bit seems more than a little creepy when you sit through it!)If you are still awake now, (and believe me that will be an effort!), you'll no doubt be expecting a possible ripper finish to repay you for sitting through the glacial pace of a film that could induce a state of coma in even the most hyperactive amongst us!SPOILER ALERT:IT NEVER COMES!NOTHING!There's a very weak ""artsy"" attempt at an ironic ending, but as it's so well known that Americans simply do not understand that particular concept AT ALL, you too will wonder why they went for it.No one, ...neither the police nor Jack seem able to draw the VERY obvious conclusion from a roadside accident they see as they return from a stakeout?They were all waiting for a large black station-waggon to show up, ....the very same sort of vehicle that has just been involved in the accident on it's way to the place they have just come from?Are they all dumb or what?Jack, who up until now has been represented as a reasonably astute sort of bloke, now apparently suffers some sort of mental breakdown at his bizarre inability to solve the crime. The film concludes with a dishevelled Nicholson sitting amidst the dilapidated remnants of his store, just repeatedly muttering to himself like some schizophrenic old unkempt alcoholic.This depressing scene is maintained for a VERY long time, thus giving you too plenty of time to mutter to YOUR self over just how you were conned into watching this right to the end in the vain hope that something would happen to at least reward you for your patience....and endurance!Perhaps the whole thing is a metaphor about how if you retire to the backwoods and associate long enough with all the mentally deficient hillbillys, then you too will lose your marbles and end up a gibbering idiot? SO reduced in cranial capacity that you will be unable to draw even the most simple of connections between clues that are so damned blatantly presented that a three-year old could grasp the solution?Just the two stars from me, ...and they're mainly for the cinematography, certainly not for the apparently non-existent editing.

Sean Penn lets the story unfold artistically, not giving away to much so we are surprised at what happens next. It is not a happy upbeat film and seems to be mainly a character study of a retired police cop, who really has not ever had a intimate relationship with anyone and hasn't gotten close enough to make friends with anybody in his force. They know him and respect him, yet there isn't that really cool camaraderie which goes with being really important to someone. The theme revolves around child sexual abuse and homicide, not a pretty picture. Jerry, Nicholson, becomes obsessed with the case and makes a pledge to the mother that he will find the killer. Intuitively, he knows that the wrong person got nabbed. A virtuoso performance by Del Toro and Eckerson. A real creepy confession, another artful turn by the director to take us off the beaten path. Jerry pledges to find the truth out and things seem to be going good, until a turn of fate, causing the cookie to crumble, a matter of speaking, I don' want to divulge to much, the cookie is Jerry.

I has the muddle characterized by speed-writing, and a lack of careful, thoughtful introspection and analysis.  One reviewer said the film is not for &quot;dolts.&quot;  Aside from the being irrelevant and a rather ham-handed attack at the film's detractors, that is beside the point.  Clearly, the Pledge has some high concepts and ambitions, but the story it tells fails in providing coherent characters, as well a muddled story line.What, then, is the ultimate message?  Is it that life's circumstances can go irrationally, tragically wrong?  That a man's &quot;pledge&quot; (an ill-advised one at that), despite being borne of the noblest motives (it appears), can result in a life spiralling out of control and leading to alcoholic psychosis?  Frankly, we never learn enough about any of the characters to understand their motives, and while some of the acting performances resonate with potential (Benecio Del Toro in particular), they are arranged in a sloppy jigsaw.I left this film quite certain of one thing--it wasn't really worth the time to watch, despite the good intentions and interesting ideas that didn't cohere.",2,"Muddled, worthy effort, falls under its own gravitas.",1071964800,"12 21, 2003",2003,1218,"['had', 'guess', 'screenplay', 'Pledge', 'was', 'partially', 'realized', 'early', 'draft', 'muddle', 'characterized', 'speed-writing', 'lack', 'careful', 'thoughtful', 'introspection', 'analysis', 'One', 'reviewer', 'said', 'film', 'not', 'quot', 'quot', 'Aside', 'being', 'irrelevant', 'rather', 'ham-handed', 'attack', 'film', 'detractors', 'beside', 'point', 'Clearly', 'Pledge', 'high', 'concepts', 'ambitions', 'story', 'fails', 'providing', 'coherent', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'muddled', 'story', 'line.What', 'then', 'ultimate', 'message', 'life', 'circumstances', 'can', 'go', 'irrationally', 'tragically', 'wrong', 'man', 'quot', 'pledge', 'quot', 'ill-advised', 'one', 'being', 'borne', 'noblest', 'motives', 'can', 'result', 'life', 'spiralling', 'control', 'leading', 'alcoholic', 'psychosis', 'Frankly', 'never', 'learn', 'enough', 'characters', 'understand', 'motives', 'acting', 'performances', 'resonate', 'potential', 'Benecio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'particular', 'are', 'arranged', 'sloppy', 'jigsaw.I', 'left', 'film', 'quite', 'certain', 'one', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'worth', 'time', 'watch', 'good', 'intentions', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'did', ""n't"", 'cohere']",N/A

He played a high school student whose main pursuits were surf boarding and pot smoking. His was one of the great breakthrough performances. Still, who would have thought he would become not only one of the world's premiere serious actors, but also a fine director? The Pledge is his latest directorial tour de force, and, like his previous efforts, it is heavy stuff. Some viewers will love it for the very reasons that others will hate it.Jerry Black [Jack Nicholson] is about to retire as a detective for the Reno, Nevada police department. He is looking forward to doing a lot of fishing. On his last day, the body of a brutally murdered little girl is discovered. The prime suspect is an Indian [Benicio Del Toro] with mental problems. During an interrogation, he confesses, but Jerry, who is watching the process on a closed circuit TV, thinks something is fishy about it. He doesn't believe the suspect has the capacity to know what he is confessing to. A little later, the Indian grabs a deputy's gun and kills himself. To the department, the case is now closed, but Jerry swore on his soul to the victim's mother that justice would prevail. He doesn't give up, even though he is now retired. During his investigation, he discovers two unsolved murders that are very similar to the first case. He pinpoints an area near which the killer may live. He actually moves to the area and even meets a woman [Robin Wright Penn] he falls in love with. He also becomes attached to her small daughter, but ultimately it his obsession with solving the crime that rules him.This is Nicholson's best role in some time, and he is supported by a remarkable cast. Some of these players have just one scene, but each of them still brings a power that the movie might not otherwise have had.After the first thirty minutes, The Pledge breaks from traditional formula. It turns out that Jerry may be simply confused by years of cynical police work, bad relationships and heavy drinking. He finds a suspect, but he is the only one who finds the man suspicious. To prove his theory, will he go to any lengths? Will he even put his lover's daughter in harm's way? Is he really committed to the victim's mother, or was he a cop so long that he doesn't know how to stop being one? The movie is full of such questions, as well as ambiguities, and this is much of what makes it different. The movie knows that in life there are few pat answers. It can be a long road from assumptions to the truth. The Pledge mirrors life more than most other movie do, and this is what will make some people love it and others hate it.",3,Nicholson superb in somewhat ambiguous film,1016150400,"03 15, 2002",2002,2721,"['first', 'time', 'got', 'look', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'was', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'outrageous', 'hit', 'comedy', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'played', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'main', 'pursuits', 'were', 'surf', 'boarding', 'pot', 'smoking', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'breakthrough', 'performances', 'Still', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'would', 'become', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'world', 'premiere', 'serious', 'actors', 'also', 'fine', 'director', 'Pledge', 'latest', 'directorial', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'previous', 'efforts', 'heavy', 'stuff', 'viewers', 'will', 'love', 'very', 'reasons', 'others', 'will', 'hate', 'it.Jerry', 'Black', '[', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', ']', 'retire', 'detective', 'Reno', 'Nevada', 'police', 'department', 'looking', 'forward', 'doing', 'lot', 'fishing', 'last', 'day', 'body', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'little', 'girl', 'discovered', 'prime', 'suspect', 'Indian', '[', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', ']', 'mental', 'problems', 'interrogation', 'Jerry', 'who', 'watching', 'process', 'closed', 'circuit', 'TV', 'something', 'fishy', ""n't"", 'believe', 'suspect', 'capacity', 'know', 'what', 'confessing', 'little', 'later', 'Indian', 'grabs', 'deputy', 'gun', 'department', 'case', 'now', 'closed', 'Jerry', 'swore', 'soul', 'victim', 'mother', 'justice', 'would', 'prevail', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'even', 'now', 'retired', 'investigation', 'two', 'unsolved', 'murders', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'first', 'case', 'area', 'killer', 'may', 'live', 'actually', 'area', 'even', 'woman', '[', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', ']', 'love', 'also', 'attached', 'small', 'daughter', 'ultimately', 'obsession', 'solving', 'crime', 'rules', 'him.This', 'Nicholson', 'best', 'role', 'time', 'supported', 'remarkable', 'cast', 'players', 'have', 'just', 'one', 'scene', 'still', 'power', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'otherwise', 'have', 'had.After', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'Pledge', 'breaks', 'traditional', 'formula', 'out', 'Jerry', 'may', 'be', 'simply', 'confused', 'years', 'cynical', 'police', 'work', 'bad', 'relationships', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'suspect', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'man', 'suspicious', 'prove', 'theory', 'will', 'go', 'lengths', 'Will', 'even', 'put', 'lover', 'daughter', 'harm', 'way', 'really', 'committed', 'victim', 'mother', 'was', 'cop', 'so', 'long', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'stop', 'being', 'one', 'movie', 'full', 'such', 'questions', 'as', 'well', 'ambiguities', 'much', 'what', 'different', 'movie', 'life', 'are', 'few', 'pat', 'answers', 'can', 'be', 'long', 'road', 'assumptions', 'truth', 'Pledge', 'mirrors', 'life', 'more', 'most', 'other', 'movie', 'do', 'what', 'will', 'make', 'people', 'love', 'others', 'hate']",N/A

Or shall I say, those that don't become corrupt politicians (generally, upper echelon), felons, or suicidal/alcohol/drug-infused, stupefied meltdowns.Most honorable cops consider the 'career' an admirable profession: unlike the 'jobs' that the rabble that comprise our rapidly, exponentially impelled; otherwise imploding, third-world simplistic mentality society.What I mean by this statement is, many honorable policeman consider [all that it entails] the profession to be a supreme distinction to throw their lives in the face of danger to persons unknown to them: regardless of status. Sure, it is an ideal. When is the last time a true hero (not the many shrinking violets) of todays proceedings accomplished this?Cowards comprise many aspects of today's proceedings: mettle or courage is scarce.I have often said that our creator could place an ""angel"" in uniform [in many of our large American cities today] and they would become corrupted with the continual onslaught of the rancid black bile of personally targeted human malice: Goodness, decency, and integrity from a policeman's perspective is rare indeed.Nicholson contends with what I just alluded to, albeit on a smaller yet more intimate scale. His character embarks on the very personal mission to find a killer: A promise made.As depicted by this movie, the price of justice is often horrific. One mans horrendous yet overly due death is also the demise of a shining example of the relentless pursuit of the notion of justice. The allegorical death of a decent soul ruined by the excursion is the aftermath.Buy this movie, watch it, and think deeply about the unfairness of this game called life. Comprehend the concept of an honorable thin-blue-line separating the malaise from you. Evil in all forms wins most of the time.However, I realize far too many dolts (one is too many), simply don't care until tragedy strikes directly at ones' door . . .By then it is too late.",5,"I suggest all cops quit, resign, retire: Few citizens truly care what you do.",1061078400,"08 17, 2003",2003,2240,"['seeing', 'musing', 'import', 'movie', 'have', 'determined', 'primarily', 'Nicholson', 'consummate', 'actor', 'Jack', 'may', 'be', 'nut', 'tad', 'eccentric', 'real', 'life', 'Roman', 'Polanski', '.The', 'reason', 'gave', 'title', 'review', 'fourteen', 'textual', 'units', 'simple', 'equation', 'cops', 'care', 'shall', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'become', 'corrupt', 'politicians', 'generally', 'upper', 'echelon', 'felons', 'suicidal/alcohol/drug-infused', 'stupefied', 'meltdowns.Most', 'honorable', 'cops', 'consider', ""'career"", 'admirable', 'profession', ""'jobs"", 'rabble', 'comprise', 'rapidly', 'exponentially', 'impelled', 'otherwise', 'imploding', 'third-world', 'simplistic', 'mentality', 'society.What', 'mean', 'statement', 'many', 'honorable', 'policeman', 'consider', '[', 'profession', 'be', 'supreme', 'distinction', 'throw', 'lives', 'face', 'danger', 'persons', 'unknown', 'regardless', 'status', 'Sure', 'ideal', 'When', 'last', 'time', 'true', 'hero', 'not', 'many', 'shrinking', 'violets', 'todays', 'proceedings', 'accomplished', 'Cowards', 'comprise', 'many', 'aspects', 'today', 'proceedings', 'mettle', 'courage', 'scarce.I', 'have', 'often', 'said', 'creator', 'could', 'place', 'angel', 'uniform', '[', 'many', 'large', 'American', 'cities', 'today', ']', 'would', 'become', 'corrupted', 'continual', 'onslaught', 'rancid', 'black', 'bile', 'personally', 'targeted', 'human', 'malice', 'Goodness', 'decency', 'integrity', 'policeman', 'perspective', 'rare', 'indeed.Nicholson', 'what', 'just', 'alluded', 'albeit', 'smaller', 'yet', 'more', 'intimate', 'scale', 'character', 'embarks', 'very', 'personal', 'mission', 'find', 'killer', 'promise', 'made.As', 'depicted', 'movie', 'price', 'justice', 'often', 'horrific', 'One', 'horrendous', 'yet', 'overly', 'due', 'death', 'also', 'demise', 'shining', 'example', 'relentless', 'pursuit', 'notion', 'justice', 'allegorical', 'death', 'decent', 'soul', 'ruined', 'excursion', 'aftermath.Buy', 'movie', 'watch', 'think', 'deeply', 'unfairness', 'game', 'called', 'life', 'Comprehend', 'concept', 'honorable', 'thin-blue-line', 'separating', 'malaise', 'Evil', 'forms', 'most', 'time.However', 'realize', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'dolts', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'directly', 'ones', 'door', '.By', 'then', 'too', 'late']",N/A

580987,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00005BCKG,Michael Crane,"[2, 2]","A while back I wrote a pretty bad review about this movie; literally bashing the hell out of it.  I thought it was the worst movie I had ever seen and I wished I had gotten my money back at the theater.  Well, I have had the chance to watch it again, this time on DVD, and it seems like I made a pretty big mistake.  This isn't the worst movie after all.  I actually enjoyed it much more the second time around.First, it wasn't all my fault.  The movie was advertised completely wrong.  You are sold on the idea that &quot;The Pledge&quot; is going to be a non-stop thrill ride like &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; or &quot;The Bone Collector.&quot;  This movie is somewhat of a thriller, but it is more of a film noir.  That was another problem; I didn't know what a &quot;film noir&quot; was until I took a film class in college last semester.  Now that I know what a film noir consists of, I was able to appreciate this movie for what it was.  This movie relies more on story and character development than anything else.  We slowly get to see Jack Nicholson becoming more obsessive over his desire to find &quot;The Wizard&quot;; a child killer who just might strike again.Don't get me wrong, in no way is this film flawless.  It still has some problems.  Some scenes drag out a little longer than they should, and we should've seen Nicholson starting to become wrapped up more and more into his dark little world of promises and desire in a way that would better set the stage up for the conclusion, which some people may find unsatisfying.  Now knowing what I was going to see, I can appreciate how it ends more.  You may need to see it more than once to realize if you like it or not.Sean Penn did a great job of making this film.  You can easily tell that he wasn't in it for the money; otherwise he would've made it more gory, more action-packed, and so on.  He wanted to make a film that he could be proud of, and one with great artistic value.Again, I apologize for my first review, although it was a pretty funny one.  The advertising of the film was the main problem.  This is more of a watch-it-at-home type rather than a one to see in theaters.  RENT this one first before buying it; it's a unique one that only a certain number of people are bound to like.  Sorry, no eye-popping DVD special features, so don't have your heart set on that aspect of the DVD.  All in all, &quot;The Pledge&quot; is a great film noir with a few thrills that enriches the movie even more.",3,"Please, Ignore My First Review of this Film  (3  1/2 stars)",1010275200,"01 6, 2002",2002,2485,"['while', 'back', 'wrote', 'pretty', 'bad', 'review', 'movie', 'literally', 'bashing', 'hell', 'thought', 'was', 'worst', 'movie', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'wished', 'had', 'gotten', 'money', 'back', 'theater', 'Well', 'have', 'had', 'chance', 'watch', 'again', 'time', 'DVD', 'made', 'pretty', 'big', 'mistake', ""n't"", 'worst', 'movie', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'much', 'more', 'second', 'time', 'around.First', 'was', ""n't"", 'fault', 'movie', 'was', 'advertised', 'completely', 'wrong', 'are', 'sold', 'idea', 'quot', 'Pledge', 'quot', 'going', 'be', 'non-stop', 'thrill', 'ride', 'quot', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'quot', 'quot', 'Bone', 'Collector.', 'quot', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'thriller', 'more', 'film', 'noir', 'was', 'problem', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'quot', 'film', 'noir', 'quot', 'was', 'took', 'film', 'class', 'college', 'last', 'semester', 'Now', 'know', 'what', 'film', 'noir', 'was', 'able', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'what', 'was', 'movie', 'more', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'anything', 'else', 'slowly', 'get', 'see', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'becoming', 'more', 'obsessive', 'desire', 'find', 'quot', 'Wizard', 'quot', 'child', 'killer', 'who', 'just', 'might', 'strike', 'again.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'way', 'film', 'flawless', 'still', 'problems', 'scenes', 'drag', 'out', 'little', 'longer', 'should', 'should', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Nicholson', 'starting', 'become', 'wrapped', 'more', 'more', 'dark', 'little', 'world', 'promises', 'desire', 'way', 'would', 'better', 'set', 'stage', 'up', 'conclusion', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'unsatisfying', 'Now', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'can', 'appreciate', 'how', 'more', 'may', 'need', 'see', 'more', 'once', 'realize', 'like', 'not.Sean', 'Penn', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'film', 'can', 'easily', 'tell', 'was', ""n't"", 'money', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'more', 'gory', 'more', 'action-packed', 'so', 'wanted', 'make', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'proud', 'one', 'great', 'artistic', 'value.Again', 'apologize', 'first', 'review', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'one', 'advertising', 'film', 'was', 'main', 'problem', 'more', 'watch-it-at-home', 'type', 'rather', 'one', 'see', 'theaters', 'RENT', 'one', 'first', 'buying', 'unique', 'one', 'only', 'certain', 'number', 'people', 'are', 'bound', 'like', 'Sorry', 'eye-popping', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'heart', 'set', 'aspect', 'DVD', 'quot', 'Pledge', 'quot', 'great', 'film', 'noir', 'few', 'thrills', 'movie', 'even', 'more']",N/A

Let's first work on pros: (I'm not going to give a synopsis, because if you're reading this, you've already read the reviews adajcent to mine which contain the summary) Jack Nicholson was perfect. His performance was astounding, and I am really sad this was a January release, as Oscar has a tendency to forget the early ones. (The Silence Of The Lambs being an exception--February `91, if my memory serves) Also, the cameos, or small parts, delivered by Vanessa Redgrave and Mickey Rourke were phenomenal. Absolutley riviting. And there are at least two jump out of your seat shocks in the film, ones that had me breathing heavily for a minute after. But now the cons. The movie, at some points was a solid 3 and a half star film (out of 4) I was happy with the characters, I had a feeling everything was going to work out in the end, and I was content. But by the end of the film, things get messed up royally. There is no satisfactory form of closure in this movie, and it leaves you wanting things to be different. This is just my opinion, I could be wrong.Now you see, I have no problem with Nicholson, or Penn, or even the screenwriters, because this problem stems from the source material, the book. Even though I don't know why Penn and crew would be so intent on making a film with this type of ending, I don't blame them. Penn coaxed some incredible performances out of his actors, and he is to be commended. As for whether or not this DVD is going to be on my shelf?

It is a totally engrossing film that will take you on a dark journey of the soul, the soul of one retired detective seeking justice he believes was not served , and at the same time battling his inner demons of loneliness and obsessions.What makes great actors? actors whose speech or expressions will stay with the viewer for a long time? It is their ability to totally be the character without visible effort or 'acting', and at the same time, pulling the viewers with them into the world they have created.Jack Nicholson is one such actor..How many of us still remember that manic face with these immortal words 'Here's Johnny' in The Shinning? or the hard military man under interrogation in A Few Good Men, or the eccentric and sad world of Melvin Udall in As Good As It Gets, I think many..In the Pledge, Nicholson manages it again, offering a very powerful performance worthy of any award..His anguish, loneliness, obsession to find the 'killer' while at the same time trying very hard to cope with his retirement and finding his peace of mind, these elements are interwined and part and parcel of the person he has become, and the failure of any will fail the other, and hence his final deterioration.Although the film is about the killer/killing, and some of the crime scenes are very harrowing, (I am surprised how they passed the censor's normally twitchy fingers), it becomes more of a character psychological study of a man on the verge of collapse..We enter inside Nicholson's mind, and we see his suspicions and increasing tortured soul, and we too become uncertain as to the identity of the killer..can it be the one that the police initially caught and who killed himself at the station (an excellent Del Toro), or another man like Nicholson strongly believes? It does not matter at the end.It is not about catching the killer anymore, and more about the failure of an old frustrated cop to seek his personal redemption.The mood is slow, but never boring, rather reflecting perfectly the mood of a retired but gradually obsessed Nicholson.Like Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn proves that he is an excellent director, doing a wonderful job behind the camera, and not only he is an actor's director, but quite visual too, as the cinematography is top class,and the scenery breathtaking (Penn allows time to linger on it inan almost meditative eye).The score is haunting and complements the scenes perfectly.And the amount of top actors in small supporting roles is very interesting and adds a lot of weight to the film: Del Toro, Mikey Rourke (in a very short but well acted scene)Vanessa Redgrave, Harry Dean Stanton and Helen Mirren, whose character as a psychologist offers the viewer the first hint of Nicholson's tortured existence in a very memorable scene.The Pledge is therefore an excellent underrated film that is a feast to the eyes and most importantly to the soul, to be added the collection of every 'cinema' lover.",5,What a Film!!,1047859200,"03 17, 2003",2003,3031,"['Not', 'Dolores', 'Clairborne', 'did', 'film', 'manage', 'totally', 'captivate', 'Pledge', 'did', 'totally', 'engrossing', 'film', 'will', 'take', 'dark', 'journey', 'soul', 'soul', 'one', 'retired', 'detective', 'seeking', 'justice', 'was', 'not', 'served', 'same', 'time', 'battling', 'inner', 'demons', 'loneliness', 'great', 'actors', 'actors', 'speech', 'expressions', 'will', 'stay', 'viewer', 'long', 'time', 'ability', 'totally', 'be', 'character', 'visible', 'effort', ""'acting"", 'same', 'time', 'pulling', 'viewers', 'world', 'have', 'created.Jack', 'Nicholson', 'one', 'such', 'actor..How', 'many', 'still', 'remember', 'manic', 'face', 'immortal', 'words', 'Johnny', 'Shinning', 'hard', 'military', 'man', 'interrogation', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'eccentric', 'sad', 'world', 'Melvin', 'Udall', 'As', 'Good', 'think', 'Pledge', 'Nicholson', 'again', 'offering', 'very', 'powerful', 'performance', 'worthy', 'award..His', 'anguish', 'loneliness', 'obsession', 'find', ""'killer"", 'while', 'same', 'time', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'cope', 'retirement', 'finding', 'peace', 'mind', 'elements', 'are', 'interwined', 'part', 'parcel', 'person', 'become', 'failure', 'will', 'fail', 'other', 'hence', 'final', 'film', 'killer/killing', 'crime', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'harrowing', 'am', 'surprised', 'how', 'passed', 'censor', 'normally', 'twitchy', 'fingers', 'more', 'character', 'psychological', 'study', 'man', 'verge', 'collapse..We', 'enter', 'Nicholson', 'mind', 'see', 'suspicions', 'increasing', 'tortured', 'soul', 'too', 'become', 'uncertain', 'identity', 'killer..can', 'be', 'one', 'police', 'initially', 'caught', 'who', 'killed', 'station', 'excellent', 'Del', 'Toro', 'man', 'Nicholson', 'strongly', 'not', 'matter', 'end.It', 'not', 'catching', 'killer', 'anymore', 'more', 'failure', 'old', 'frustrated', 'cop', 'seek', 'personal', 'redemption.The', 'mood', 'slow', 'never', 'boring', 'rather', 'reflecting', 'perfectly', 'mood', 'retired', 'gradually', 'obsessed', 'Nicholson.Like', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'excellent', 'director', 'doing', 'wonderful', 'job', 'camera', 'not', 'only', 'actor', 'director', 'quite', 'visual', 'too', 'cinematography', 'top', 'class', 'scenery', 'breathtaking', 'Penn', 'time', 'linger', 'almost', 'meditative', 'eye', '.The', 'score', 'haunting', 'complements', 'scenes', 'perfectly.And', 'amount', 'top', 'actors', 'small', 'supporting', 'roles', 'very', 'interesting', 'lot', 'weight', 'film', 'Del', 'Toro', 'Mikey', 'Rourke', 'very', 'short', 'well', 'acted', 'scene', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'character', 'psychologist', 'viewer', 'first', 'hint', 'Nicholson', 'tortured', 'existence', 'very', 'memorable', 'scene.The', 'Pledge', 'therefore', 'excellent', 'underrated', 'film', 'feast', 'eyes', 'most', 'importantly', 'soul', 'be', 'added', 'collection', ""'cinema"", 'lover']",N/A
580992,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00005BCKG,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[3, 3]","Vaguely reminiscent in tone to Paul Schrader's movie `Affliction', The Pledge is Sean Penn's third outing as a Director.  As with his previous work it is very much a study of human beings, their strengths their weaknesses and their flaws. Beautifully photographed, it is also morally ambiguous and ultimately downbeat portrayal of a good man obsessed with fulfilling a promise and unable to let go of the past in his attempt to give his life meaning.Opening with an unkempt Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) apparently rambling incoherently to himself, the rest of the movie is told in flashback, with Jerry returning from a fishing trip and about to start his last day as a police detective. However, when a young boy witnesses a retarded native American man (Beniccio Del Torro) fleeing in the snow and subsequently discovers the body of a young girl, who has been brutally raped and murdered, Jerry, despite his imminent retirement, promises the distraught parents that he will catch whomever is responsible. Later Jerry refuses to believe the murder is an open and shut case, carrying on his own investigation even when the officer in charge of the investigation (Aaron Eckhart) is only too keen to blame it on the now deceased Indian.Jack Nicholson (who previously collaborated with Sean Penn, on the also excellent Crossing Guard) delivers one of his finest performances, in his subtle portrayal of a good man trying to keep a promise but at a personal cost. And whilst this is far from the type of feel good movie such as `As Good As It Gets' that won him his last Best Actor  Oscar, this is in my opinion a far superior movie and a far superior performance, in that although this haunting movie will not send you to bed with your faith in the human spirit restored, it will make you think and stay with you for much longer than any of your typical Hollywood fare. Also excellent is the supporting cast, especially including a cast against type dowdy single mother, Robin Wright Penn, as well as Aaron Eckhart, Sam Shepard, Beniccio Del Torro, Helen Mirren and Tom Noonan.The Pledge is a disturbing film  but it is beautifully filmed and for this praise must be directed toward Chris Menges (Local Hero) for his beautiful cinematography. Admittedly this is an uncommercial and slow paced movie which certainly wont be to everyone's taste and although some people will be critical of his at times somewhat ponderous style of directing, Sean Penn (dir. The Indian Runner and The Crossing Guard) subtly allows his actors to shine.  Penn is as far as I'm concerned, one of America's finest character actors but he can surely now add to his resume the title of, one of America's great young film directors and I highly recommend this very intelligent movie (though clearly it will fly over many peoples heads).",4,HAUNTING AND INTELLIGENT!!!,1013212800,"02 9, 2002",2002,2807,"['Vaguely', 'reminiscent', 'tone', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'movie', 'Affliction', 'Pledge', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'third', 'outing', 'Director', 'previous', 'work', 'very', 'much', 'study', 'human', 'beings', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'flaws', 'Beautifully', 'photographed', 'also', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'ultimately', 'downbeat', 'portrayal', 'good', 'man', 'obsessed', 'fulfilling', 'promise', 'unable', 'let', 'go', 'past', 'attempt', 'give', 'life', 'meaning.Opening', 'unkempt', 'Jerry', 'Black', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'apparently', 'rambling', 'incoherently', 'rest', 'movie', 'told', 'flashback', 'Jerry', 'returning', 'fishing', 'trip', 'start', 'last', 'day', 'police', 'detective', 'However', 'when', 'young', 'boy', 'retarded', 'native', 'American', 'man', 'Beniccio', 'Del', 'Torro', 'fleeing', 'snow', 'subsequently', 'body', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'brutally', 'raped', 'murdered', 'Jerry', 'imminent', 'retirement', 'distraught', 'parents', 'will', 'catch', 'whomever', 'responsible', 'Later', 'Jerry', 'believe', 'murder', 'open', 'shut', 'case', 'carrying', 'own', 'investigation', 'even', 'when', 'officer', 'charge', 'investigation', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'only', 'too', 'keen', 'blame', 'now', 'deceased', 'Indian.Jack', 'Nicholson', 'who', 'previously', 'collaborated', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'also', 'excellent', 'Crossing', 'Guard', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'subtle', 'portrayal', 'good', 'man', 'trying', 'keep', 'promise', 'personal', 'cost', 'whilst', 'far', 'type', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'such', 'as', 'As', 'Good', 'won', 'last', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'opinion', 'far', 'superior', 'movie', 'far', 'superior', 'performance', 'haunting', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'send', 'bed', 'faith', 'human', 'spirit', 'restored', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'stay', 'much', 'longer', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'Also', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'including', 'cast', 'type', 'dowdy', 'single', 'mother', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'as', 'well', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'Beniccio', 'Del', 'Torro', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Tom', 'Noonan.The', 'Pledge', 'disturbing', 'film', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'praise', 'must', 'be', 'directed', 'Chris', 'Menges', 'Local', 'Hero', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'Admittedly', 'uncommercial', 'slow', 'paced', 'movie', 'certainly', 'wont', 'be', 'everyone', 'taste', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'critical', 'times', 'somewhat', 'ponderous', 'style', 'directing', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'dir', 'Indian', 'Runner', 'Crossing', 'Guard', 'subtly', 'actors', 'shine', 'Penn', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'one', 'America', 'finest', 'character', 'actors', 'can', 'surely', 'now', 'add', 'resume', 'title', 'one', 'America', 'great', 'young', 'film', 'directors', 'highly', 'recommend', 'very', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'clearly', 'will', 'fly', 'many', 'peoples', 'heads']",N/A

These three names alone will bring mainstream viewers to this film; however 90% of them will be expecting Hollywood and 90% will walk away from this film because they have just watched something closer to art-house cinema than the A-list Hollywood affair that it promotes.The Pledge is akin to watching something like Dead Man Walking minus the Hollywood plot devices or Spike Lee's Summer of Sam without the pace. It certainly is not like Silence of the Lambs, Seven or Psycho as some have been thinking. If your expectations are Hollywood, then forget it. You will only be disappointed. If you are looking for a serial killer film that moves in a more realistic fashion with non-mainstream plot elements then The Pledge will deliver.There are a number of things that make this film different. Nicholson's character is more obsessive and paranoid but keeps his cool for the most part of this film. He also befriends a woman half his age and this is not your typical Hollywood bonding. The actual investigation of the serial killings is more or less played out in a very realistic way, often boring and never really seems to amount to much. The crime evidence is hard to obtain and the investigation leads are miniscule (as with most real-life cases). For this reason Nicholson's character is mostly trying to grasp at straws which leaves him on the ignore list at his former police department. In retirement he buys a filling station and tags cars that he believes could be connected with the crimes. The crimes themselves are brutal and VERY GRAPHIC. There are a number of scenes depicting child murders that are very disturbing.The film's realism is what makes it so good. It is slow and often may seem boring, but this is daring and the director should be appreciated for not doing what WE HAVE SEEN A HUNDRED TIMES BEFORE. The fact is that most serial killer flicks are clich&eacute;d driven but here Penn takes us on a very different journey from a lot of different angles. In short, this film is much closer to a real-life hunt for a serial killer than any other mainstream Hollywood murder mystery flick.The ending will annoy some, but personally I love it. I think that the ending is very suitable for the material at hand because in most cases serial killers, who are not caught, are either - dead/have gone insane/have been locked up for another unrelated crime. So this film really does play out the realism very well. I also like the fact that certain plot elements are left unknown to many of the characters. This is a very good character device and you do not see that done very often.This is a very original movie that stays on rational ground. The scene where the cops decide to tell the parents of a dead girl what has happened is absolutely one of the most troubling things any human being can do and it is just done so well in this movie. I can not see how this film fails to engage anyone with a heart. This is a touching film - a touching journey into the darker crossings in life that some do go through.This is a very good movie with some ""reservations"" for those who hate anything less than ""mainstream"" murder mysteries.",5,Hyper-realism marred by a history of Hollywood.,1073260800,"01 5, 2004",2004,3191,"['Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'three', 'names', 'alone', 'will', 'bring', 'mainstream', 'viewers', 'film', 'however', '90', '%', 'will', 'be', 'expecting', 'Hollywood', '90', '%', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'film', 'have', 'just', 'watched', 'something', 'closer', 'art-house', 'cinema', 'A-list', 'Hollywood', 'affair', 'Pledge', 'akin', 'watching', 'something', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'Hollywood', 'plot', 'devices', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Summer', 'Sam', 'pace', 'certainly', 'not', 'like', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Seven', 'Psycho', 'have', 'been', 'thinking', 'expectations', 'are', 'Hollywood', 'then', 'forget', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'disappointed', 'are', 'looking', 'serial', 'killer', 'film', 'more', 'realistic', 'fashion', 'non-mainstream', 'plot', 'elements', 'then', 'Pledge', 'will', 'deliver.There', 'are', 'number', 'things', 'make', 'film', 'different', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'more', 'obsessive', 'paranoid', 'cool', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'also', 'woman', 'age', 'not', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'bonding', 'actual', 'investigation', 'serial', 'killings', 'more', 'less', 'played', 'out', 'very', 'realistic', 'way', 'often', 'boring', 'never', 'really', 'amount', 'much', 'crime', 'evidence', 'hard', 'obtain', 'investigation', 'leads', 'are', 'miniscule', 'most', 'real-life', 'cases', 'reason', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'mostly', 'trying', 'grasp', 'straws', 'ignore', 'list', 'former', 'police', 'department', 'retirement', 'filling', 'station', 'tags', 'cars', 'could', 'be', 'connected', 'crimes', 'crimes', 'are', 'brutal', 'VERY', 'GRAPHIC', 'are', 'number', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'child', 'murders', 'are', 'very', 'disturbing.The', 'film', 'realism', 'what', 'so', 'good', 'slow', 'often', 'may', 'seem', 'boring', 'daring', 'director', 'should', 'be', 'appreciated', 'not', 'doing', 'what', 'WE', 'HAVE', 'SEEN', 'A', 'HUNDRED', 'TIMES', 'BEFORE', 'fact', 'most', 'serial', 'killer', 'flicks', 'are', 'clich', 'eacute', 'driven', 'here', 'Penn', 'very', 'different', 'journey', 'lot', 'different', 'angles', 'short', 'film', 'much', 'closer', 'real-life', 'hunt', 'serial', 'killer', 'other', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'murder', 'mystery', 'flick.The', 'ending', 'will', 'annoy', 'personally', 'love', 'think', 'ending', 'very', 'suitable', 'material', 'hand', 'most', 'cases', 'serial', 'killers', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'caught', 'are', 'dead/have', 'gone', 'insane/have', 'been', 'locked', 'up', 'unrelated', 'crime', 'film', 'really', 'play', 'out', 'realism', 'very', 'well', 'also', 'fact', 'certain', 'plot', 'elements', 'are', 'left', 'unknown', 'many', 'characters', 'very', 'good', 'character', 'device', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'done', 'very', 'often.This', 'very', 'original', 'movie', 'rational', 'ground', 'scene', 'where', 'cops', 'decide', 'tell', 'parents', 'dead', 'girl', 'what', 'happened', 'absolutely', 'one', 'most', 'troubling', 'things', 'human', 'being', 'can', 'do', 'just', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'engage', 'anyone', 'heart', 'touching', 'film', 'touching', 'journey', 'darker', 'crossings', 'life', 'do', 'go', 'through.This', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'reservations', 'who', 'hate', 'anything', 'less', 'mainstream', 'murder', 'mysteries']",N/A

However, I think the movie was too long and too drawn out. Nickolson's character was suffering from paranoia about the little girl being kidnapped and killed. He made a promise to one of the girl's mother to get to the bottom of it and not to quit until they find the person that killed her little girl.

His performance is remarkable. Sean Penn directs this film, and as we know, Sean Penn does not like the ordinary, he goes for the unusal charcters that shape and define our lives. This film has a grocery list of some of our finest actors,Benicio Del Toro, Aaron Eckhart, Robin Wright Penn, Sam Shepard, Helen Mirren, Patricia Clarkson, Beau Daniels, Michael O'Keefe, Vanessa Redgrave, Mickey Rourke, Eileen Ryan, Sam Shepard, and Harry Dean Stanton. Each scene was a gem, and the last third of the film has you on the edge of your seat.The film begins as a police story and then becomes a story of one man and his personal issues. Jack Nicholson, Detective Jerry Black, is a good policeman who on the eve of his retirement is brought into a grisly crime of a young girl who is murdered. It is thought that the killer is found and that answers this crime. However, Jack Nicholson's character does not believe this man was the murderer and goes on to find clues to solve this mystery. At the beginning of the film, he 'pledges' to the mother of the first murdered child that he will finds the killer. Jerry goes to such extremes as to buy an isolated gas station in the midst of the wilds of Nevada. He has found that the killer has a pattern, and he thinks that this town is near the area where the killer may next strike. A telling scene, is when Jerry visits a psychiatrist, played by Helen Mirren. He wants assitance in drawing out clues from a drawing the murdered child drew. What happens is that the psychiatrist is able too draw out Jerry, and the first signs appear that something is not right.This is not a simple story, but a very complicated look into the mind of a good man who has problems. The film is gripping and the characters are so intricate and nvolved that we are drawn in as more than just viewers. The photography is beautiful and the back areas of Nevada are shown in all its glory. In the closing credits I found that the film was shot in Canada, and that was a disappointment. Jack Nicholson delivers the role of his life and once again shows us what this type of ability can give to a film. I am surprised I had never heard of this film until recently. I would urge everyone to view it.Highly Recommended. prisrob 01-25-12As Good As It GetsFair Game",5,"""By His Soul's Salvation""",1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,2402,"['ever', 'was', 'film', 'deserved', 'Academy', 'Award', 'acting', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', ""'The"", 'Pledge', 'performance', 'remarkable', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'film', 'know', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'not', 'ordinary', 'unusal', 'charcters', 'shape', 'define', 'lives', 'film', 'grocery', 'list', 'finest', 'actors', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Beau', 'Daniels', 'Michael', ""O'Keefe"", 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Eileen', 'Ryan', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'scene', 'was', 'gem', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'edge', 'seat.The', 'film', 'police', 'story', 'then', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'personal', 'issues', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Detective', 'Jerry', 'Black', 'good', 'policeman', 'who', 'eve', 'retirement', 'brought', 'grisly', 'crime', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'murdered', 'thought', 'killer', 'found', 'answers', 'crime', 'However', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'not', 'believe', 'man', 'was', 'murderer', 'find', 'clues', 'solve', 'mystery', 'beginning', 'film', 'mother', 'first', 'murdered', 'child', 'will', 'finds', 'killer', 'Jerry', 'such', 'extremes', 'buy', 'isolated', 'gas', 'station', 'midst', 'wilds', 'Nevada', 'found', 'killer', 'pattern', 'town', 'area', 'where', 'killer', 'may', 'next', 'strike', 'telling', 'scene', 'when', 'Jerry', 'psychiatrist', 'played', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'assitance', 'drawing', 'out', 'clues', 'drawing', 'murdered', 'child', 'drew', 'What', 'psychiatrist', 'able', 'too', 'out', 'Jerry', 'first', 'signs', 'appear', 'something', 'not', 'right.This', 'not', 'simple', 'story', 'very', 'complicated', 'look', 'mind', 'good', 'man', 'who', 'problems', 'film', 'gripping', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'intricate', 'nvolved', 'are', 'drawn', 'as', 'more', 'just', 'viewers', 'photography', 'beautiful', 'back', 'areas', 'Nevada', 'are', 'shown', 'glory', 'closing', 'credits', 'found', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Canada', 'was', 'disappointment', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'role', 'life', 'once', 'again', 'what', 'type', 'ability', 'can', 'give', 'film', 'am', 'surprised', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'recently', 'would', 'urge', 'everyone', 'view', 'it.Highly', 'Recommended', 'prisrob', '01-25-12As', 'Good', 'GetsFair', 'Game']",N/A

581010,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005BCKG,Reviewer,"[0, 0]","This moody, brooding character study examines how intuition born of a lifetime's work can lead to unhealthy obsession, the effects of which, in the end, can ultimately render the basis for it irrelevant, especially when particular circumstances are introduced that serve to derail the initial focus and prevent the possibility of a tenable resolution.  ""The Pledge,"" directed by Sean Penn, is an incisive, probing drama of a driven man who is psychologically and emotionally incapable of letting go of an event that-- in his mind, at least-- remains unresolved.  And it explores that aspect of human nature that, in certain individuals, at any rate, refuses to allow disregard of even a perceived infraction of justice; it's a matter of being imbued with a kind of innate moral code and being obliged to follow it-- regardless of where it may lead.Detective Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) of the Reno P.D. has come to the end of an illustrious career; it's time to pull the pin and go fishing.  But Jerry's retirement party is interrupted by the report of the brutal murder of a young girl, whose body has just been found in the woods.  Officially, Jerry only has six hours left on the clock, but he insists on being a part of the investigation.  And it's a decision that is ultimately going to have a decided effect on the rest of his life; not only because of the heinousness of the crime, which creates the kind of image that will forever haunt even a seasoned professional like Jerry, but because Jerry makes a promise to Margaret Larsen (Patricia Clarkson), the bereaved mother of the murdered girl, that the individual responsible will be found and brought to justice.Jerry's life takes an irreversible turn, however, when a suspect is apprehended and charged with the crime, but prevailing circumstances and Jerry's intuition lead him to believe they have the wrong man.  By the cold light of the next morning, though, Jerry is retired, and the case is no longer his concern; but justice, and the promise he made to the girl's mother still is, and whether he wants it or not, Jerry's involvement with this case is going to follow him into retirement.  No matter where he goes or what he does, it will always be a part of him, a constant companion.  And sooner or later, it's something that is going to have to be resolved, with or without the help and resources of the department to which he dedicated so much of his life.  One way or another, Jerry-- responding to some subconscious impetus-- is going to solve this case, and he's going to do it his way, and to his satisfaction.  Until then, in his mind anyway, this case is still ""open,"" and will remain so, until he deems otherwise and the forces compelling him at last subside.  And leave him in peace.As an actor, Sean Penn has demonstrated a range and depth of emotion that at times fairly implodes (as with his portrayal of Matthew Poncelet in ""Dead Man Walking""), and with such strength that the outward reverberations of it have a decided impact on the film.  And his subtle approach as a director has the same effect here.  His studied presentation and deliberate pace creates an underlying tension that runs through the film like a wire being slowly drawn tighter and tighter until it is taut to the point of breaking, and his hand is constantly on that wire, controlling it-- allowing it some slack to effect a false sense of security, for example, before snapping! it back again, and making the drama of the story riveting in a way that definitely keeps the attention of the audience.  He attaches you to Jerry Black as he quietly leads him through a field of emotional land mines, and it keeps you involved; indeed, as a viewer, you have no choice, and like Jerry, you have no respite from the situation, which enables you to relate to Jerry on a very personal level.  And that connection is reinforced further by Jerry's involvement with a single mother, Lori (Robin Wright Penn), a waitress at a local diner; and as their friendship evolves, Penn twists that wire even more, and the tension escalates.  This is commendable work by Penn, who has taken a basically good story (the screenplay is by Jerzy Kromolowski and Mary Olson-Kromolowski, based on the book by Friedrich Durrenmatt) to a higher level and turned it into a penetrating, insightful drama.The combination of Penn and Jack Nicholson makes for an effective collaboration, in that Nicholson approaches his character, Jerry, with that same sense of reflective introspection that Penn brings to the film as director.  And it works splendidly; Nicholson creates a character who is always seemingly on the edge, and you can feel that ever present tension and sense of discontent that defines who Jerry really is and what he's all about.  On a certain level, Nicholson's portrayal is reminiscent in attitude and perspective of the character he created so memorably in ""Ironweed,"" Francis Phelan.  This is a guy who plays the game of life with a perpetual poker face on; he maintains a reserved countenance that belies the constant roiling going on behind his eyes.  And the fact that Nicholson can convey all of this so well, even in his (or Jerry's) most guarded moments, is what makes his performance so powerful and convincing.  He plays it entirely from the inside out, and the result is an absorbing, unforgettable character.The supporting cast includes Benicio Del Toro (Wadenah), Vanessa Redgrave (Annalise), Sam Shepard (Eric), Aaron Eckhart (Sam), Mickey Rourke (Jim) and Tom Noonan (Gary).  Sean Penn has a way of telling a story that is uniquely his own, and it's that distinction that sets ""The Pledge,"" apart and makes it so engaging.  This isn't a ""throw-away popcorner,"" but one you're going to want to mull over for awhile after the screen has gone dark.",4,Solid Drama from Sean Penn,1027296000,"07 22, 2002",2002,5799,"['moody',

581011,A1N441OPDOIL3T,B00005BCKG,R.L.,"[0, 0]","I saw this film on TV yesterday. The ending reminded me of Brando's directorial effort in One-Eyed Jacks in 1961. Marlon wanted to end his film with his girlfriend killed as they rode away together from a shootout, which some say would have heightened the power and irony of the film. Instead, the editors chose to keep the girl alive, and have the two ride off into the sunset. Happy ending, happy audience. Such is not the case here, with director Sean Penn, true to Brando, choosing to end the film with as many questions as it began--leaving Nicholson's detective character a confused pile of mush. Unhappy ending, unhappy audience. The movie did not do well at the box office--though highly acclaimed critically. Did anyone bother to see the connection between the burned up black car, the porcupine? toy, and the picnic rendezvous with the little girl? And what happened to that boy in the beginning who witnessed a man running from the first little girl's body in the woods, then getting into his red pickup truck? We see the boy in the police car, then later in the movie during a parade. There are too many loose ends here.

581012,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005BCKG,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[7, 10]","The Pledge (Sean Penn, 2000)Watching this movie after reading the book upon which it is based has the distinct feeling one gets while watching a brand new  Ferrari speeding towards a brick wall at a hundred twenty miles per hour. You know from the moent it comes into your view that something is terribly wrong, and you know what the outcome will be, yet  you continue to watch in hopes that the driver will turn the wheel at the last minute and survive the spectacle. Unfortunately, The Pledge is like the Spyder that Elias Koteas used for the James Dean  recreation in the film Crash-- you know that the guy behind the wheel here not only wanted the crash to occur, but that the crash was ultimately the main reason for the existence of the situation. From  there, the best thing you can do is pick it apart and take a twisted fascination in seeing how everything went so horribly wrong.In this case, you can sum up what went wrong in one easy sentence: the screenwriters who adapted the book had their priorities  really, really screwed up. Instead of focusing on the main character's downfall and making the film into the same brilliant character study the book is, the film focuses on the subplot that is simply the  catalyst for the main characters downfall. As a result, many of the scenes in the first half of the book upon which the narrative turns are gutted or altogether excised. The end result is that the main  character, Black (Jack Nicholson), ends up looking like a levelheaded cop who's going about his business investigating a crime, even past his retirement, who eventually suffers a meteoric descent into  madness for no discernible reason. (This isn't a spoiler: the opening scene of the movie is Nicholson standing, staring into the sun, muttering to himself and drinking.) This isn't Lovecraft; people don't go  mad overnight in Durrenmatt's work. What makes his novels and plays so downright delicious is the descent itself, watching the main character(s) go mad just because they can't handle the world the way it  is. It's not the one big event, it's the multitude of small events. That is absent from the screenplay, and the movie suffers greatly for it.Looked at as its own piece, the movie becomes a bit more bearable. Black is a cop who catches a child murder case with six hours to  go on the last day before he retires. He promises the child's mother that he will catch the murderer. The next day, the police have a suspect in custody, thanks to a witness who can place him at  the scene. Everyone's convinced the suspect is the murderer except Black, who keeps digging into the case in order to find the real killer. It's a tried and true mystery formula, and it could  have been made to work here. But, to turn my earlier argument on its head, once you get past the point where the scriptwriters gutted Durrenmatt's novel, they then decided to keep as much of what happens  AFTER this as possible (changing enough to make a 1957 novel look contemporary and setting it in America, both of which are cosmetic changes). This is where the movie fully derails, as the lack  of setup in the beginning makes everything that happens in the second half of the film look coincidental at best. It just doesn't work...",2,Durrenmatt is spinning in his grave.,1011571200,"01 21, 2002",2002,3241,"['Pledge', 'Sean', 'Penn', '2000', 'Watching', 'movie', 'reading', 'book', 'based', 'distinct', 'feeling', 'one', 'watching', 'brand', 'new', 'Ferrari', 'speeding', 'towards', 'brick', 'wall', 'hundred', 'twenty', 'miles', 'hour', 'know', 'moent', 'view', 'something', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'know', 'what', 'outcome', 'will', 'be', 'continue', 'watch', 'hopes', 'driver', 'will', 'turn', 'wheel', 'last', 'minute', 'survive', 'spectacle', 'Unfortunately', 'Pledge', 'Spyder', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'used', 'James', 'Dean', 'recreation', 'film', 'Crash', 'know', 'guy', 'wheel', 'here', 'not', 'only', 'wanted', 'crash', 'occur', 'crash', 'was', 'ultimately', 'main', 'reason', 'existence', 'situation', 'there', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'do', 'pick', 'apart', 'take', 'twisted', 'fascination', 'seeing', 'how', 'everything', 'went', 'so', 'horribly', 'wrong.In', 'case', 'can', 'sum', 'up', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'one', 'easy', 'sentence', 'screenwriters', 'who', 'adapted', 'book', 'had', 'priorities', 'really', 'really', 'screwed', 'up', 'Instead', 'focusing', 'main', 'character', 'downfall', 'making', 'film', 'same', 'brilliant', 'character', 'study', 'book', 'film', 'subplot', 'simply', 'catalyst', 'main', 'characters', 'downfall', 'result', 'many', 'scenes', 'first', 'half', 'book', 'narrative', 'turns', 'are', 'gutted', 'altogether', 'excised', 'end', 'result', 'main', 'character', 'Black', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'up', 'looking', 'levelheaded', 'cop', 'who', 'going', 'business', 'investigating', 'crime', 'even', 'retirement', 'who', 'eventually', 'meteoric', 'descent', 'madness', 'discernible', 'reason', ""n't"", 'spoiler', 'opening', 'scene', 'movie', 'Nicholson', 'standing', 'staring', 'sun', 'muttering', 'drinking', ""n't"", 'Lovecraft', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'mad', 'overnight', 'Durrenmatt', 'work', 'What', 'novels', 'plays', 'so', 'downright', 'delicious', 'descent', 'watching', 'main', 'character', 's', 'go', 'mad', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'world', 'way', 'not', 'one', 'big', 'event', 'multitude', 'small', 'events', 'absent', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'suffers', 'greatly', 'it.Looked', 'own', 'piece', 'movie', 'bit', 'more', 'bearable', 'Black', 'cop', 'who', 'child', 'murder', 'case', 'six', 'hours', 'go', 'last', 'day', 'child', 'mother', 'will', 'catch', 'murderer', 'next', 'day', 'police', 'have', 'suspect', 'custody', 'thanks', 'witness', 'who', 'can', 'place', 'scene', 'Everyone', 'convinced', 'suspect', 'murderer', 'Black', 'who', 'digging', 'case', 'order', 'find', 'real', 'killer', 'tried', 'true', 'mystery', 'formula', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'work', 'here', 'turn', 'earlier', 'argument', 'head', 'once', 'get', 'point', 'where', 'scriptwriters', 'gutted', 'Durrenmatt', 'novel', 'then', 'decided', 'keep', 'much', 'what', 'AFTER', 'possible', 'changing', 'enough', 'make', '1957', 'novel', 'look', 'contemporary', 'setting', 'America', 'are', 'cosmetic', 'changes', 'where', 'movie', 'fully', 'lack', 'setup', 'beginning', 'everything', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'look', 'coincidental', 'best', 'just', ""n't"", 'work']",N/A
581013,A361LE16VBQDP8,B00005BCKG,Robert Bezimienny,"[6, 15]","Mediocre minds can become famous and powerful: this film attests to this fact.  Sean Penn is good actor, but a poor director, and a poor judge of a screenplay.  Yet obviously he has clout and credibility as an actor, so when he calls his actor buddies, out they come...Boy, oh boy, Sean, I'm impressed!  You know Sam Shepherd!  And Vanessa Redgrave!  You even defrosted Harry Dean Stanton, but you could have thawed him out for longer than two minutes - I suppose fair's fair 'though: that's about all anybody gets.  Penn thinks that if a subject is 'serious' or 'disturbing', then it justifies a long movie - the Hollywood Academy agrees with him (if you want to win the award for best picture, better make your movie over two hours).  This is a very tedious story, with very few surprises, and almost no character development.  Jerry Black, Jack Nicholson's character, gets obsessed, goes a bit loopy and...well, that's about it really.  Why?  Who cares...well, Sean doesn't in any case.  To stretch out the thin material out and to hammer it into the audience that they are watching 'disturbing' and 'important' subject matter, Penn resorts to ponderous long takes - often with the opposite of the intended effect: in Benicio's interrogation scene he mumbles and shakes for so long that the cinema audience started laughing.  We also get close ups of coffee pots, of bottles of whiskey; we have blurred shots, lots of camera panning, repetitive shots of Jack driving his truck on scenic roads - it looks like Sean has watched a few European films, thought some of the techniques looked good, so (why not?) bung 'em into his film, even if they are utterly pointless here.  Oh, and since we're being 'cutting edge', how about some really grim crime-scene shots - yeah, let's push that envelope, baby.  Clearly, as a director, Penn is a second-rate intelligence.  Insulting the audience further, he thinks that a 'sad' ending, means a 'deep' film: is that really all it takes Sean?  Gee, it's that easy, huh?  This is boring rubbish.  Jack Nicholson is a shadow of his former rudely endearing self.  Robin Wright Penn does not become a better actress by having a fake broken tooth.  If you want to see a slow-paced film with great moral weight and complexity, try 'Ordet' by Carl Dreyer, or 'Andrei Rublev' by Andrei Tarkovsky; or if you want an engrossing crime movie, why not 'L.A.Confidential' or 'The Untouchables'; and if you want to see the beautiful scenery in Nevada, go to Nevada.",1,A waste of talent and resources,999907200,"09 8, 2001",2001,2489,"['Mediocre', 'minds', 'can', 'become', 'famous', 'powerful', 'film', 'fact', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'good', 'actor', 'poor', 'director', 'poor', 'judge', 'screenplay', 'obviously', 'clout', 'credibility', 'actor', 'so', 'when', 'actor', 'buddies', 'come', 'Boy', 'oh', 'boy', 'Sean', ""'m"", 'impressed', 'know', 'Sam', 'Shepherd', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'even', 'defrosted', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'could', 'have', 'thawed', 'out', 'longer', 'two', 'minutes', 'suppose', 'fair', 'fair', 'anybody', 'Penn', 'subject', ""'serious"", ""'disturbing"", 'then', 'long', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'Academy', 'want', 'win', 'award', 'best', 'picture', 'better', 'make', 'movie', 'two', 'hours', 'very', 'tedious', 'story', 'very', 'few', 'surprises', 'almost', 'character', 'development', 'Jerry', 'Black', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'obsessed', 'bit', 'loopy', 'well', 'really', 'Why', 'Who', 'well', 'Sean', ""n't"", 'case', 'stretch', 'out', 'thin', 'material', 'out', 'hammer', 'audience', 'are', 'watching', ""'disturbing"", ""'important"", 'subject', 'matter', 'Penn', 'ponderous', 'long', 'often', 'opposite', 'intended', 'effect', 'Benicio', 'interrogation', 'scene', 'shakes', 'so', 'long', 'cinema', 'audience', 'started', 'laughing', 'also', 'get', 'close', 'ups', 'coffee', 'pots', 'bottles', 'whiskey', 'have', 'blurred', 'shots', 'lots', 'camera', 'panning', 'repetitive', 'shots', 'Jack', 'driving', 'truck', 'scenic', 'roads', 'Sean', 'watched', 'few', 'European', 'films', 'thought', 'techniques', 'looked', 'good', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'bung', 'film', 'even', 'are', 'utterly', 'pointless', 'here', 'Oh', ""'re"", 'being', ""'cutting"", 'edge', 'how', 'really', 'grim', 'crime-scene', 'shots', 'yeah', 'let', 'push', 'envelope', 'baby', 'Clearly', 'director', 'Penn', 'second-rate', 'intelligence', 'Insulting', 'audience', 'further', ""'sad"", 'ending', ""'deep"", 'film', 'really', 'Sean', 'Gee', 'easy', 'huh', 'boring', 'rubbish', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'shadow', 'former', 'rudely', 'endearing', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'not', 'become', 'better', 'actress', 'having', 'fake', 'broken', 'tooth', 'want', 'see', 'slow-paced', 'film', 'great', 'moral', 'weight', 'complexity', 'try', 'Carl', 'Dreyer', 'Rublev', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'want', 'engrossing', 'crime', 'movie', 'why', 'not', 'L.A.Confidential', ""'The"", 'Untouchables', 'want', 'see', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'Nevada', 'go', 'Nevada']",N/A

This film not only answers this question -- the bad guy loses, but the good guys don't &quot;win&quot; -- it also takes in the world outside your movie theater (or home) as part of engaging you.  Why did Penn linger so long on things unrelated to the mystery or chase?  The answer is in the &quot;long&quot; -- he lets the settings and music lull you into wishing the whole crime could be forgotten, the hero could enjoy his retirement.  We see the life any non-cop might enjoy.  But since he's a cop, the world is still not &quot;right&quot; to him until he resolves this crime; then, perhaps, he may enjoy the beauty of the place he's chosen.  At the same time, we understand how this beauty is threatened by crime; his choice may be inevitable.  He does everything he knows is right, yet the world has its own way of resolving the problem without regard to his needs.  The prologue doesn't &quot;telegraph&quot; or give away anything.  It tells us not to expect the wrong resolution, and expect slick-suspense-movie action.  Nicholson is obviously tormenting himself over something that went wrong, so that we can then watch for what he did to make it go wrong.  That's the REAL mystery.  He has a beautiful retired life, and a chance to use his skills to heal both a shattered family and his own misgivings at turning his job over to lesser men.  Being a cop, he may not see it, but these hopes are in tension; whether or not he does anything about it.  Being a cop, he sets himself up to pay a worse personal price than any of us might.  He had thought of everything, planned masterfully; ... what WAS the problem?  The pledge itself; not just the one over this crime, but the one he implicitly made when he first took the job.  He cannot perfectly honor it.  See how YOU would test yourself against it!  The universe is harder than we are, but also more forgiving, a very hard lesson for the ultimate system of rational hopes: criminal justice.  THAT'S why Penn takes his time: to let what's at stake sink in, and THAT'S what the film is about.  And all this came to me solely through feeling it, as I watched.

581015,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005BCKG,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","Child endangerment has always struck me as rather questionable source material for adult thrillers &#65533; particularly when that threat takes the form of child rape and murder.  &#65533;The Pledge&#65533; wallows in the muck of the subject matter a bit much for my taste, but the film does boast some interesting twists on this otherwise dubious theme.For the first of its two hours, &#65533;The Pledge&#65533; treads along some pretty familiar ground.  Jack Nicholson plays Jerry Black, a veteran Nevada police detective who, on the very day of his retirement party, ends up at the scene of the brutal slaying of a 7-year old girl.  Jerry finds himself pledging to her distraught mother that he will leave no stone unturned in bringing her child&#65533;s killer to justice.  Almost immediately, a suspect is arrested and forced to confess, but he kills himself while being taken to his cell, thus closing the case for all concerned &#65533; except, of course, Jerry who, for reasons unfathomable to him or us &#65533; other than that this is the way these plots always turn out &#65533; feels that something is not quite kosher with the outcome.  Thus, throughout the first half, the film goes through the motions common to this narrative setup: over-the-hill veteran follows a hunch that all the less seasoned pros dismiss as the rantings of a guy unable to give up the glory of the chase and settle into the quiet life of leisurely retirement.  Jerry is, thus, on his own to prove them wrong and to bring the true culprit to justice.But just as we are all settled in, ready to follow the movie along its preprogrammed course, damned if director Sean Penn and writer Jerry Kromolowsky don&#65533;t pull the rug out from under us, sending the film off into new and unconventional territory.  For slowly but surely we begin to see subtle hints that all may not be quite right with Jerry&#65533;s psyche.  Could it be true &#65533; as a number of people along his way suggest &#65533; that perhaps he really can&#65533;t cope with the mundane world of domesticity and that he needs to &#65533;create&#65533; a case to make himself feel as if he is still a part of the action?  Or is he, perhaps, so traumatized by the brutality of the crime whose aftermath he&#65533;s witnessed and so obsessed with fulfilling his &#65533;pledge&#65533; to the girl&#65533;s mother that he can&#65533;t see facts as they really are and feels compelled to devise scenarios that will allow him to play the hero, thereby validating his own relevance?  Or is it possible that he can be both mentally unbalanced and right about his hunches at the same time?  Friedrich Durrenmatt&#65533;s novel provides a solid core upon which the filmmakers can build their case.  Even some of the predictable red herrings achieve more than their usual credibility when filtered through the mind of this potentially disturbed man.  And the downbeat ending demonstrates a bravery rarely seen in Hollywood these days.Nicholson does a superb job playing out the many aspects of Jerry&#65533;s mind and personality and Robin Wright Penn provides strong support as the waitress he comes to love through the course of the film.  I wish the filmmakers hadn&#65533;t felt compelled to enlist an assortment of big name actors to provide cameo appearances throughout the movie.  In this backwater area, it becomes disconcerting to see people like Vanessa Redgrave, Mickey Rourke, Sam Shephard, and Harry Dean Stanton pop up for their five-minute appearance, then disappear into the background never to be seen again.  This game of spot-the-stars becomes not only distracting but undercuts the air of authenticity the film is trying so hard to achieve with its location shooting and somber pacing.As a director, Penn shows definite assurance, allowing the story to unfold at its own deliberate pace, never feeling compelled to interject irrelevant action sequences for their own sweet sake.

581016,A6FIAB28IS79,B00005BCKG,Samuel Chell,"[1, 2]","I've rarely been this disappointed in, even irritated by, a film.  The story has great resonance--possibilities for the symbolic if not archetypal.  On the day of his retirement, the detective played by Jack Nicholson has one more opportunity to perform an act worthy of Ingmar Bergman's knight in ""The Seventh Seal,"" who is seeking to perform one significant, possibly redeeming action, in the face of death that is plaguing the homeland to which he has just returned from the Crusades.  But Sean Penn's manipulative camera, permitting the viewer to see even smaller pieces of the action than Hitchcock's, ultimately fails to deliver not just the suspense, surprise, and reward of a Hitchcock masterpiece but fails to ""say"" anything--about working and retiring, or completing the hero's circle of life, or the importance of even ""trying"" to fulfill a pledge even if the result must inevitably prove futile.Many of us embark on a journey of life as teachers, preachers, physicians, parents and protectors, only to realize, at journey's end, that we've fallen short of our early idealist dreams.  To receive one more chance to set things right, and take a pledge to do so, is an opportunity almost too good to be true, though the very possibility stirs us with thoughts of a ""life well-lived,"" a journey ""successfully completed."" Perhaps Penn even had such a thought in mind as the overarching, archetypal narrative frame for the movie.  But in the end he throws his audience under the bus as assuredly as he does the anonymous, unapprehended killer Nicholson has pledged to bring to justice ""on his very soul.""Some viewers will no doubt reward the film points on the basis of a closure that runs contrary to virtually every one of the ""Law and Order,"" ""Criminal Minds,"" and sexual deviant shows that now run, endlessly and back-to-back, on cable TV.  Unfortunately, that's not reason enough to like ""The Pledge.""  Poets, novelists, musicians, and especially scriptwriters study ""closure"" as though it were a form unto itself--it can make or break all that has preceded the end.  Moreover, Penn's camera has been so ultra-selective in what it chooses to reveal to the spectator--from the incredulous, chubby face of the young boy who witnesses something horrible (the molestation that initiated Nicholson's ""encore"" as a law man) to the conflagration that erases not merely the sexual deviant but his identity--that the camera's cat-and-mouse game, even at the climactic moment. breaks the covenant that must exist between a filmmaker and his audience for any movie to assert its power to suspend disbelief.I can't go much further without ""giving away"" the movie.  But try, if you might, to imagine a Norman Bates (""Psycho"") who is erased from the story with Janet Leigh's final glimpse of him; or of a Kim Novak who vanishes with Jimmy Stewart's inference that she has drowned in the Bay; or, to take another film and director, Jimmy Stewart's suicide on Christmas eve as reportage for the Potter-owned ""Bedford Falls News"" on Christmas Day.  Disappointing?  Depressing? Irresponsible?  Yes, it's all that and more, because the director would have violated his ""pledge"" to the viewer to conceal but eventually ""to heal.""Some may defend the ending on the grounds that in some wacky sense ""The Pledge"" is completed, since the rapist who motivated Nicholson's valiant, self-sacrificing quest is brought to a swift and sure end in a fiery inferno.  But of what value is the fulfillment of a promised pledge if nobody knows?  (We might wonder if Penn has asked the same question about his efforts as a film-actor/film-maker.)  And even if justice accomplished is known only to us the spectators, what if it comes at the expense of an American Indian (who now will remain the ""confessed killer"" of the film's first rape)?  Is that fair to the Indian?  And if Nicholson was proven right (but only to himself and us) in his driving, and honorable, belief that coerced confessions are not to be trusted, what hope does the film leave for genuine justice the next time some poor sap, or the ""usual suspect,"" is brought to court on suspicion of rape and harrassed until he'll say anything, including a false confession?The best moment in the film, at least for this experienced film-goer, is the ascending reddish ballon belonging to Chrissie (the 2nd girl), along with the ominous feelings of dread that it evokes in Nicholson and us.  Somewhat like the shoot-out in ""The Untouchables"" with Kevin Coster (the scene on the steps of a train station when our attention is suddenly directed to a mother's out-of-control, rapidly descending baby carriage--a scene lifted from Eisenstein's ""Potemkin""), the unattended, rising ballon is an ""inside"" allusion that only the film-literate will catch immediately.  It's from Fritz Lang's powerful movie, ""M"" (1930), as daring a film as any that comes to mind.  It tries to make the case for a child-molester-killer (Peter Lorre), who ""cannot help himself.""  Was that Penn's purpose--to spare the offender the usual justice--a shoot-out with Nicholson? Or possibly to work around the child-killer's capture, leading to the capital punishment that Lang abhorred?  (Maybe Penn simply wanted to avoid taking on an issue as controversial as sparing child killers from the death penalty.)  Who knows? Who cares? In this case, the personal success of his evasive tactic led to the downfall of his forgettable film.",2,Penn blows it (except for the allusive balloon),1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,5436,"[""'ve"",

The centerpiece is the great Jack Nicholson, a guy who never gives a boring performance and is doubtlessly even more interesting in real life.  Sean Penn directs.  The whole thing has the potential to grind to a halt under its Oscar-caliber weight but never does.  Instead, ""The Pledge"" is a compelling story, mostly because everyone works so hard to never get in its way.  It is drama the way drama is supposed to be, the way American films used to be able to tell a dramatic story but for the last 20 years it seemed only foreign films could accomplish.  The plot is as disturbing as it it is simple:  A little girl is brutally murdered, a suspect is caught but commits suicide, and a retired cop must chase the mystery with only his instincts to guide him to the real killer.  Nicholson provides a ""regular guy"" gravitas to a role so different from his usual shtick that he deserves special consideration just for that.  And even if Sean Penn is doing a Bob Raphaelson impression in more than a few scenes, except for some annoying quick zooms, he is deft in his approach as director.  Anyone watching ""The Pledge"" and expecting the standard Hollywood whodunnit will be disappointed; this is a steely drama as wrinkled and foul as real life.  In many ways, it is a character study more than a drama, and in this, the low budget works to its advantage.

He sacrifices his retirement and the respect of his peers to keeping this pledge, and as we follow him in his quest the story becomes less about solving a mystery and more about the degenerative effects of obsession - in particular, how the desire to do good can drive us to destructive, immoral ends.  Penn has assembled an impressive cast for this film, which is easily the best of the three he's directed.  The calibre of the ensemble is at moments distracting, but there's no doubting the skill they bring to their roles, e.g. Nicholson's scene with Helen Mirren as a psychiatrist is exceptionally written and performed.  This film isn't for everyone.  Those looking for an exciting cop-thriller or a tale of redemption should look elsewhere.  This is a slow-burning psychological drama which, though suspenseful at times, unfolds with a tragic inevitability essential to its theme.  Penn is developing into a great director.  His preference for foregrounding performance, which threatened to undo his early films, is more controlled here and is aided by an economical screenplay.

581024,A3UMC7TLQSUK25,B00005BCKG,"Stewart Axelrad ""sunbard""","[26, 32]","First, let me say that I consider Jack Nicholson to be one of most underrated actors of his generation. His performance in &quot;The Pledge&quot; is nothing short of remarkable, not so much in the way his speaks the dialogue, but in those moments when he has none, and reveals the mind of a deeply tormented man. Other reviews have discussed the plot, so I'll dispense with that, other than to say that this is a movie about redemption and a lost cause. The pledge referred to in the title is one that Nicholson cannot assuredly keep, and thus forfeits his &quot;soul's salvation&quot;. The Nicholson character is basically a lonely, desperate man, who hangs his hopes on catching a serial killer, and by a twist of fate, fails in his mission. The supporting cast is excellent, Benecio Del Toro, Robin Wright Penn and even Vanessa Redgrave (one of the best performances in the film, although a brief one-scene cameo). Sean Penn's direction is superb, with the intercutting of nature scenes with the main plot (watch for the symbolic flock of birds throughout the film).

581027,AQE1MEY6KUC2V,B00005BCKG,"Thomas A. Baker ""t_baker""","[9, 12]","&quot;The Pledge&quot; flew under most everyone's radar when it was released theatrically earlier this year.  I was somewhat surprised at the time, given the success of dark films like &quot;Seven&quot; and the pedigree of Nicholson and Sean Penn, but it makes sense in retrospect.  Today's multiplex is not friendly to movies like this. &quot;The Pledge&quot; is a flawed study of obsession that isn't for everyone.  You may turn it off halfway through, bored with director Penn's deliberate style.  Or, like me, you may be compelled to see it again and again.Not many actors have the presence to pull a role like Jerry Black off, and Nicholson does it with skill to burn. However, while the script turns on some nagging questions, one of them  undermines much of the film: we don't understand Jerry well enough to know what fuels his obsession.  Was it some previous case that went bad?  &quot;The Pledge&quot; doesn't want to give you all the answers, and leaves several things deliberately cryptic, but everything hinges on Jerry's motivation.  How did Mrs. Larsen (Patricia Clarkson) coax such a life-or-death pledge out of Jerry?  And if he agrees merely to tell a grieving mother what she wants to hear, why does he feel so bound by the pledge, and why does he follow through to such a degree? Another major flaw is the stunted romance between Jerry and Robin Wright Penn's character--it feels obligatory, as if the screenwriters were just using a tried and true playbook, but it's somewhat implausible, doesn't serve the plot, and should've been scrapped.But with Nicholson, the consummate pro, and some good use of the Nevada setting's stark beauty (the night- and snow-bound murder scene is as good as movies get), &quot;The Pledge&quot; overcomes some script weaknesses and pacing problems to deliver a flawed but compelling portrait of human obsession.  A warning: if you like every answer wrapped up in a neat little package at the end, this is NOT the movie for you. &quot;The Pledge&quot; is challenging and flawed, but I'll take a movie like this over any number of &quot;Pearl Harbors&quot; that you want to throw my way.",3,A flawed but compelling film,997142400,"08 7, 2001",2001,2138,"['quot', 'Pledge', 'quot', 'flew', 'most', 'everyone', 'radar', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'theatrically', 'earlier', 'year', 'was', 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'time', 'given', 'success', 'dark', 'films', 'quot', 'Seven', 'quot', 'pedigree', 'Nicholson', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'sense', 'retrospect', 'Today', 'multiplex', 'not', 'friendly', 'movies', 'quot', 'Pledge', 'quot', 'flawed', 'study', 'obsession', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'may', 'turn', 'off', 'halfway', 'bored', 'director', 'Penn', 'deliberate', 'style', 'may', 'be', 'compelled', 'see', 'again', 'again.Not', 'many', 'actors', 'have', 'presence', 'pull', 'role', 'Jerry', 'Black', 'Nicholson', 'skill', 'burn', 'However', 'script', 'nagging', 'questions', 'one', 'undermines', 'much', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Jerry', 'well', 'enough', 'know', 'what', 'fuels', 'obsession', 'Was', 'previous', 'case', 'went', 'bad', 'quot', 'Pledge', 'quot', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'answers', 'several', 'things', 'deliberately', 'cryptic', 'everything', 'hinges', 'Jerry', 'motivation', 'How', 'did', 'Mrs.', 'Larsen', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'coax', 'such', 'life-or-death', 'pledge', 'Jerry', 'merely', 'tell', 'grieving', 'mother', 'what', 'hear', 'why', 'feel', 'so', 'bound', 'pledge', 'why', 'follow', 'degree', 'major', 'flaw', 'stunted', 'romance', 'Jerry', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'character', 'obligatory', 'screenwriters', 'were', 'just', 'using', 'tried', 'true', 'playbook', 'somewhat', 'implausible', ""n't"", 'serve', 'plot', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'scrapped.But', 'Nicholson', 'consummate', 'pro', 'good', 'use', 'Nevada', 'setting', 'stark', 'beauty', 'night-', 'snow-bound', 'murder', 'scene', 'as', 'good', 'movies', 'get', 'quot', 'Pledge', 'quot', 'script', 'weaknesses', 'pacing', 'problems', 'deliver', 'flawed', 'compelling', 'portrait', 'human', 'obsession', 'warning', 'like', 'answer', 'wrapped', 'up', 'neat', 'little', 'package', 'end', 'NOT', 'movie', 'quot', 'Pledge', 'quot', 'challenging', 'flawed', ""'ll"", 'take', 'movie', 'number', 'quot', 'Pearl', 'Harbors', 'quot', 'want', 'throw', 'way']",N/A
581028,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005BCKG,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 1]","""The Pledge"" is the newest film directed by Sean Penn and stars Jack Nicholson in one of his best performances. It is also a film that Penn wants to tell at his own pace, a slow, laborious pace, which often threatens to take the film down with it.Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson), is a detective with the Reno, Nevada police department about to retire. His boss (Sam Shepard) and his replacement (Aaron Eckhart) are called away from the retirement party to deal with a new homicide. Jerry asks to ride along, even though he is six hours away from retirement. What they find is an eight year old blond girl who has been raped and killed, dumped in the snow up near a rural Nevada town. The local police are sickened by the crime and have difficulty dealing with it. The task of informing the parents eventually falls to Jerry. The grief stricken mother (Patricia Clarkson) makes Jerry promise to find the killer. He does. As he is set to leave on his retirement trip, a deep sea fishing trip paid for by people in the department, he has second thoughts and returns to the case.For the first half of the film, Nicholson investigates the murder, visiting a series of suspects or people that may be involved or able to help with the case. These people are played by an impressive array of character actors, but their roles are very small. This provides Nicholson with a showcase. Nicholson's Jerry Black is a man that is happier when working and doesn't relish the thought of retirement. This isn't portrayed in his usual bombastic way. Nicholson plays Black quietly, making him real, making him human. He could be a real detective on the police force. He shows a lot of emotion with his face, indicating when he is unhappy, frightened, disgusted, pleased, content. This is a far cry from the Nicholson we are used to watching. Believe me, it is a welcome sight to watch Nicholson become a real human being rather than a character become Nicholson.""The Pledge"" is about Jerry Blacks' journey to find the killer. He questions the girl's grandmother (Vannesa Redgrave), enlists the aid of a child psychologist (Helen Mirren), and watches the questioning of a suspect, a mentally challenged Indian (Benicio Del Toro, in his third film role in one month).At one point, Jerry shows a drawing the child did to his former boss (Shepard) . Claiming the giant drawn in the picture is the killer, Black effectively alienates the department he previously worked for. Unable to turn up new leads, he ends up buying a gas station in a small town from it's tired owner (Harry Dean Stanton). Soon, he meets an abused woman (Robin Wright Penn) and her daughter and takes them in.""The Pledge"" works as a character study, and at times, the slow pace of the film help it seem all the more authentic. Penn creates some magnificent, moody set pieces, but ultimately, the film becomes too slow for its own good. In the first hour, Penn creates an entirely believable retirement party in a run down casino restaurant. The investigation scenes in the snowy drifts are also very believable. In the second hour, when the journey becomes more personal, I enjoyed watching the way events unfolded, but I know many people were bored by the pace. Penn falls into the trap of including too many lingering shots of things. I get it. This is the way life is in this town, in this area, but it doesn't help the story in the long run.I also enjoyed the ending. It seemed more authentic than most conventional thrillers. But again, I think it left a lot of people in the dark and in the cold.There are some problems with ""The Pledge"" beyond it's pacing. The impressive list of character actors was welcome, but their roles were more distracting than anything else. Each is featured for about five minutes before Black moves on. Five minutes of Helen Mirren? She's always great, but I wanted more of her. Also, her role doesn't seem to advance the story at all. Likewise, Vanessa Redgrave. She merely reiterates that the victim was very sweet and innocent. However, the victim's mother already impressed this upon us. I guess, in a way, her character does play a bigger part in the overall film, but only indirectly. Harry Dean Stanton has literally four lines. It reminded me of some of the celebrities who appear in Woody Allen's films. Some of the celebrities are featured in large, substantial parts. Some have what basically amounts to a walk-on. These roles are walk-ons. Benicio Del Toro creates another vivid character, who has a large part in the overall mystery. In the last month, we have seen three films with Del Toro, each of which has proven that he is a very, very good actor.I think you will find Nicholson's performance in ""The Pledge"" worth the price of admission alone. Hopefully, you will not be put off by the slow pace or challenging ending.",4,"Nicholson's ""Pledge""",1113350400,"04 13, 2005",2005,4819,"['Pledge', 'newest', 'film', 'directed', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'stars', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'also', 'film', 'Penn', 'tell', 'own', 'pace', 'slow', 'laborious', 'pace', 'often', 'take', 'film', 'down', 'it.Jerry', 'Black', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'detective', 'Reno', 'Nevada', 'police', 'department', 'retire', 'boss', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'replacement', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'are', 'called', 'away', 'retirement', 'party', 'deal', 'new', 'homicide', 'Jerry', 'ride', 'along', 'even', 'six', 'hours', 'away', 'retirement', 'What', 'find', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'blond', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'raped', 'killed', 'dumped', 'snow', 'up', 'rural', 'Nevada', 'town', 'local', 'police', 'are', 'sickened', 'crime', 'have', 'difficulty', 'dealing', 'task', 'informing', 'parents', 'eventually', 'Jerry', 'grief', 'mother', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Jerry', 'promise', 'find', 'killer', 'set', 'leave', 'retirement', 'trip', 'deep', 'sea', 'fishing', 'trip', 'paid', 'people', 'department', 'second', 'thoughts', 'returns', 'case.For', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'Nicholson', 'murder', 'visiting', 'series', 'suspects', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'involved', 'able', 'help', 'case', 'people', 'are', 'played', 'impressive', 'array', 'character', 'actors', 'roles', 'are', 'very', 'small', 'Nicholson', 'showcase', 'Nicholson', 'Jerry', 'Black', 'man', 'happier', 'when', 'working', ""n't"", 'relish', 'thought', 'retirement', ""n't"", 'portrayed', 'usual', 'bombastic', 'way', 'Nicholson', 'Black', 'quietly', 'making', 'real', 'making', 'human', 'could', 'be', 'real', 'detective', 'police', 'force', 'lot', 'emotion', 'face', 'indicating', 'when', 'unhappy', 'frightened', 'disgusted', 'pleased', 'content', 'far', 'cry', 'Nicholson', 'are', 'used', 'watching', 'Believe', 'welcome', 'sight', 'watch', 'Nicholson', 'become', 'real', 'human', 'being', 'rather', 'character', 'become', 'Nicholson', 'Pledge', 'Jerry', 'Blacks', 'journey', 'find', 'killer', 'questions', 'girl', 'grandmother', 'Vannesa', 'Redgrave', 'aid', 'child', 'psychologist', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'questioning', 'suspect', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'Indian', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'third', 'film', 'role', 'one', 'month', '.At', 'one', 'point', 'Jerry', 'drawing', 'child', 'did', 'former', 'boss', 'Shepard', 'Claiming', 'giant', 'drawn', 'picture', 'killer', 'Black', 'effectively', 'department', 'previously', 'worked', 'Unable', 'turn', 'up', 'new', 'leads', 'up', 'buying', 'gas', 'station', 'small', 'town', 'tired', 'owner', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'Soon', 'abused', 'woman', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'daughter', 'Pledge', 'character', 'study', 'times', 'slow', 'pace', 'film', 'help', 'seem', 'more', 'authentic', 'Penn', 'magnificent', 'moody', 'set', 'pieces', 'ultimately', 'film', 'too', 'slow', 'own', 'good', 'first', 'hour', 'Penn', 'entirely', 'believable', 'retirement', 'party', 'run', 'down', 'casino', 'restaurant', 'investigation', 'scenes', 'snowy', 'drifts', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'believable', 'second', 'hour', 'when', 'journey', 'more', 'personal', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'way', 'events', 'unfolded', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'bored', 'pace', 'Penn', 'trap', 'including', 'too', 'many', 'lingering', 'shots', 'things', 'get', 'way', 'life', 'town', 'area', ""n't"", 'help', 'story', 'long', 'run.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'ending', 'seemed', 'more', 'authentic', 'most', 'conventional', 'thrillers', 'again', 'think', 'left', 'lot', 'people', 'dark', 'cold.There', 'are', 'problems', 'Pledge', 'pacing', 'impressive', 'list', 'character', 'actors', 'was', 'welcome', 'roles', 'were', 'more', 'distracting', 'anything', 'else', 'featured', 'about', 'five', 'minutes', 'Black', 'Five', 'minutes', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'always', 'great', 'wanted', 'more', 'Also', 'role', ""n't"", 'seem', 'advance', 'story', 'Likewise', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'merely', 'victim', 'was', 'very', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'However', 'victim', 'mother', 'already', 'impressed', 'guess', 'way', 'character', 'play', 'bigger', 'part', 'overall', 'film', 'only', 'indirectly', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'literally', 'four', 'lines', 'reminded', 'celebrities', 'who', 'appear', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'celebrities', 'are', 'featured', 'large', 'substantial', 'parts', 'have', 'what', 'basically', 'walk-on', 'roles', 'are', 'walk-ons', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'vivid', 'character', 'who', 'large', 'part', 'overall', 'mystery', 'last', 'month', 'have', 'seen', 'three', 'films', 'Del', 'Toro', 'proven', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'actor.I', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'Nicholson', 'performance', 'Pledge', 'price', 'admission', 'alone', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'slow', 'pace', 'challenging', 'ending']",N/A

So I went to see it.HE'S RIGHT!That's all I'll say of the plot except that Nicholson's character, a retired cop, pursues the truth of a murder case based on (1) the dubious technique of one of his overzealous colleagues who prodded a confession from an obviously mentally ill individual (played masterfully by Del Toro) and (2) a strong sense of intuition that he COULD find the real culprit. The case is closed because of the confession and something else you should see the film to recognize, and Nicholson's pursuit of the real killer is seen more and more by everyone else as a symptom of his own growing psychosis!What's more, at the very beginning AND end (See it if you're trying to figure out what I'm talking about.) Nicholson is a self-absorbed crackpot who's trying to figure out how he could be wrong...which even he doesn't know he wasn't. Brilliant story line.Since seeing the picture, I think a lot about it, indeed, identify with Nicholson's character. I'm leaving a job working for a person whom most think has an outstanding work ethic; most see the individual as the ultimate in self-sacrifice, near martyrdom. Were someone to criticize that person, for the person's narcissism, self-absorption and, frankly, aristocratic laziness, as I'm prone to do, he or she would be be shunned as a heretic.

Unfortunately, a mere 6 hours before Black's retirment, a little girl is raped and murdered. Black makes a pledge to the grieving mother that he will find her daughter's killer. Immediately an Indian named Toby(del Toro)is arrested for the murder, with a long criminal history Toby is a logical choice. The detectives even get a confession out of Toby, however seconds later Toby committs suicide. So the case if officially closed. However, Black isn't satisfied. He becomes obsessed when he finds out that 8 years ago another little girl was raped and murdered and another girl is still missing. They all match the same description and age range. Black goes so far as to buy a general store and start a relationship with a single mother(who has a little girl). He uses them as bait in trying to get the killer he is convinced is still out there. &quot;The Pledge&quot; is NOT a mindless action-packed Hollywood movie with a typical happy ending. It is an exercise in great acting and psychology. Jerry Black is chasing a killer but he is also trying to turn back time. There are some incredible scenes in the beginning of the movie where Black looks at pictures of himself when he was young, he also catches a glimpse of an elderly man using a walker to get around outside his window. This is what awaits Black, unless he can prove that he is still useful. Black is chasing a killer but he's also chasing his youth and usefulness. &quot;The Pledge&quot; is an intelligent work of art with an incredible performance from Nicholson.

The plot is that Jerry is at his retirement party after decades of civil service. Jerry is well respected by his fellow cops both young and old for his retirement present they send him on a fishing trip to Mexico. But there are scenes throughout the film that show that Jerry is not really happy about retiring. Instead he seems to be conflicted with the idea of being on permanent vacation.The title of the movie comes when a little girl is found murdered. Jerry leaves his retirement party to join the investigation, even though his fellow officers discourage him from joining. Jerry ""pledges"" to the murdered girl's mother that he will find the culprit. The character of Jerry Black then goes a bizarre life trek. He doesn't go fishing in Mexico, instead he moves to a small Nevada county in the center of an area where two other little girls went missing and were found murdered. Jerry believes that there is someone in the immediate are murdering little girls who fit a certain description. Jerry goes to outrageous lengths to solve this crime which only he believes is still unsolved, the police, otoh have already blamed and basically executed a suspect who they claimed was guilty.The Pledge is a great movie but it may not be for everyone especially people who like happy Hollywood endings. We the audience never learn the whole truth behind this movie but neither does Jerry so I guess that's ok. I recommend this movie highly because of Nicholson's great acting and also a cast that includes true Hollywood royalty like Aaron Eckhart, Robin Wright, the movie was directed by her then husband Sean Penn.

Very few movies provoke us the way a film should, as soon as we leave the theater we have totally forgotten what we have just seen.  This is not the case with Sean Penn's latest collaboration with Jack Nicholson (The Crossing Guard).  The Pledge is, as another reviewer stated, &quot;a breath of fresh air&quot; in the days that popcorn movies rule the box office.  Sean Penn has chosen to make a film that doesn't follow normal conventions, all the loose ends are not tied up at the end and this is certainly not your normal serial killer movie.  It isn't really even a serial killer movie it all, it is a character study of how far a man will go to keep a pledge to find the killer of a mother's daughter.  Jerry Black's pledge takes him to places he doesn't want to go, and his obsession is seen through Nicholson's emotions and actions.  By the end of the film Jerry Black isn't the same man he was at the beginning.

581039,AMMEMPM9MPS55,B00005BCKG,www.DavidLRattigan.com,"[1, 3]","I was first drawn to this film because it was filmed largely on location in and around the Okanagan-Similkameen region of British Columbia, where I live. Others in town who watched the film, partly for the same reasons, I suspect, were disappointed with it. I certainly, then, did not have my hopes set too high when I rented out this movie. I am pleased to say, then, that this film had a depth I did not expect, so I was not wholly disappointed.Sean Penn's psychological drama, set within the framework of a suspense thriller (though he eventually ties himself loose from many of the expected conventions), begins looking like a standard cop movie, with the exception of the opening credits, which give a taste of what is later to come. The first forty minutes or so has nothing to distinguish it from an episode of Law and Order, following a fairly hackneyed format: Nicholson is the retiring cop, fretting about life outside the force, who takes on one last case - a child murder - on his way out. All in all, this first section of the film is rather lacklustre.In one crucial scene, from the events of which the film takes its title, Nicholson vows to the murdered girl's mother that he will find her child's killer and bring him to justice, swearing by his own soul's salvation that he will do so. Thus the stage is set, albeit in a pretentious manner that could hardly have been executed less obliquely, for a story in which Nicholson becomes redeemer, setting off on a quest to redeem his own self, bereft of purpose in life, and be saviour to a grieving couple bereft of their only daughter.It is from this point on that Penn starts to work outside of the conventions, and blazes a trail full of ambiguities and questions as Nicholson makes it his ambition to find the child-killer. The ambiguity that characterizes every turn of the plot is suggested by the opening titles, and is reintroduced when Nicholson makes his pledge. Who is he doing it for? What motivates him? At opposite poles, we have his own sense of bereavement and angst in the event of his retirement, and the emotional reaction to seeing a murdered girl and her distraught parents. Is this about Nicholson, about the girl, or about the grieving parents? Or is it wider? We are given other reasons throughout the film that might motivate him and give a more expansive scope to his mission. This sort of incertitude is typical of the tone of the rest of the film.Ultimately, we are left none the wiser. Understandably, appetites accustomed to the standard Hollywood fare are left unsatiated by Penn's conclusion. We discover that Nicholson's existential quest to save himself and, in the process, save others, is a failure. And, indeed, we wonder whether all attempts to find salvation are similarly doomed. God and religion are treated no more favourably as solutions to the search for meaning than Nicholson's own attempts at salvation. As we watch Nicholson's descent into madness and frustration, we are get the uneasy feeling that all search for meaning and redemption is inevitably futile, and bound to lack of resolution.Perhaps, though, the film was intended merely to provoke such questions, rather than necessarily answer them. After all, so many questions are thrown up unanswered throughout the film that one can't possibly go away from The Pledge without reeling from the puzzles and riddles presented. The uncertainties of Penn's film reflect the wider ambiguities of human existence and endeavour, and it is those uncertainties that the viewer will leave thinking about.Nicholson turns in a great performance, as usual. The location filming is beautiful (I say that with an element of bias, of course), and the film is visually compelling. The haunting score, when it avoids cliches at the hands of veteran composer Hans Zimmer, complements the film's visual beauty.",3,"Interesting & worthy, if not entirely successful",1023753600,"06 11, 2002",2002,3857,"['was', 'first', 'drawn', 'film', 'was', 'filmed', 'largely', 'location', 'Okanagan-Similkameen', 'region', 'British', 'Columbia', 'where', 'live', 'Others', 'town', 'who', 'watched', 'film', 'partly', 'same', 'reasons', 'suspect', 'were', 'disappointed', 'certainly', 'then', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'hopes', 'set', 'too', 'high', 'when', 'rented', 'out', 'movie', 'am', 'pleased', 'say', 'then', 'film', 'had', 'depth', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'was', 'not', 'wholly', 'disappointed.Sean', 'Penn', 'psychological', 'drama', 'set', 'framework', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'eventually', 'loose', 'many', 'expected', 'conventions', 'looking', 'standard', 'cop', 'movie', 'exception', 'opening', 'credits', 'give', 'taste', 'what', 'later', 'come', 'first', 'forty', 'minutes', 'so', 'nothing', 'distinguish', 'episode', 'Law', 'Order', 'following', 'fairly', 'hackneyed', 'format', 'Nicholson', 'retiring', 'cop', 'fretting', 'life', 'force', 'who', 'one', 'last', 'case', 'child', 'murder', 'way', 'first', 'section', 'film', 'rather', 'lacklustre.In', 'one', 'crucial', 'scene', 'events', 'film', 'title', 'Nicholson', 'murdered', 'girl', 'mother', 'will', 'find', 'child', 'killer', 'bring', 'justice', 'swearing', 'own', 'soul', 'salvation', 'will', 'do', 'so', 'Thus', 'stage', 'set', 'albeit', 'pretentious', 'manner', 'could', 'hardly', 'have', 'been', 'executed', 'less', 'obliquely', 'story', 'Nicholson', 'redeemer', 'setting', 'off', 'quest', 'redeem', 'own', 'self', 'bereft', 'purpose', 'life', 'be', 'saviour', 'grieving', 'couple', 'bereft', 'only', 'daughter.It', 'point', 'Penn', 'work', 'conventions', 'trail', 'full', 'ambiguities', 'questions', 'Nicholson', 'ambition', 'find', 'child-killer', 'ambiguity', 'turn', 'plot', 'suggested', 'opening', 'titles', 'reintroduced', 'when', 'Nicholson', 'pledge', 'Who', 'doing', 'What', 'opposite', 'poles', 'have', 'own', 'sense', 'bereavement', 'angst', 'event', 'retirement', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'seeing', 'murdered', 'girl', 'distraught', 'parents', 'Nicholson', 'girl', 'grieving', 'parents', 'wider', 'are', 'given', 'other', 'reasons', 'film', 'might', 'motivate', 'give', 'more', 'expansive', 'scope', 'mission', 'sort', 'incertitude', 'typical', 'tone', 'rest', 'film.Ultimately', 'are', 'left', 'none', 'wiser', 'Understandably', 'accustomed', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'are', 'left', 'unsatiated', 'Penn', 'conclusion', 'discover', 'Nicholson', 'existential', 'quest', 'save', 'process', 'save', 'others', 'failure', 'indeed', 'wonder', 'attempts', 'find', 'salvation', 'are', 'similarly', 'doomed', 'God', 'religion', 'are', 'treated', 'more', 'favourably', 'solutions', 'search', 'meaning', 'Nicholson', 'own', 'attempts', 'salvation', 'watch', 'Nicholson', 'descent', 'madness', 'frustration', 'are', 'get', 'uneasy', 'feeling', 'search', 'meaning', 'redemption', 'inevitably', 'futile', 'bound', 'lack', 'resolution.Perhaps', 'though', 'film', 'was', 'intended', 'merely', 'provoke', 'such', 'questions', 'rather', 'necessarily', 'answer', 'so', 'many', 'questions', 'are', 'thrown', 'up', 'unanswered', 'film', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'go', 'away', 'Pledge', 'reeling', 'puzzles', 'riddles', 'presented', 'uncertainties', 'Penn', 'film', 'reflect', 'wider', 'ambiguities', 'human', 'existence', 'endeavour', 'uncertainties', 'viewer', 'will', 'leave', 'thinking', 'about.Nicholson', 'great', 'performance', 'usual', 'location', 'filming', 'beautiful', 'say', 'element', 'bias', 'course', 'film', 'visually', 'compelling', 'haunting', 'score', 'when', 'cliches', 'hands', 'veteran', 'composer', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'film', 'visual', 'beauty']",N/A

Questions are left unanswered. It challenges the audience, especially at the end when you're going to be angry after getting such a large dose of negative existentialism.The dirty ending is similar to the other movies Sean Penn has directed - notably ""The Indian Runner"" and ""The Crossing Guard."" Penn is a big Bruce Springsteen fan and it shows in his ambiguous treatment of the characters - he focuses in on them, shows a snapshot of their lives, and then pulls the camera away, giving barebones exposition, and trusting the audience to reach their own conclusions. For example, despite being the central character of the movie, we know almost nothing of Detective Jerry Black's (Jack Nicholson) background. And, at the end, we have no idea what's going to happen to him next.Penn doesn't give an opinion about whether Black is right or wrong to put a child in harm's way to catch a serial killer, nor does he tell us whether Black entered a relationship with the child's mother because he loved her, was lonely, or wanted to use her in his investigation (or some combination of the three). The questions left unanswered at the end are similar to those of ""Mystic River"" and make the movie so good. Penn trusts his audience to be smart.Like ""Shawshank Redemption,"" this movie demands a second viewing immediately after the first.As for the performances, Jack Nicholson and Robin Wright Penn are fantastic.

581041,A1RDLWMK8D1ORY,B00005BCKG,zeni,"[1, 3]","I like movies that don't follow the formula. I like movies that take risks. I like movies that remain with you a couple of days after you watch them. In that regard, The Pledge is right on target. Sean Penn (director), Jack Nicholson (lead), and the rest of the cast did a fabulous job in this film. Twice, I thought I had the killer all figured out; and I'm glad I was wrong. This film takes viewers down several paths for us only to find ourselves facing a dead end.My only gripes about this movie are a)the love interest between Nicholson's and Wright-Penn's characters, and b) the ending. I will never understand why every movie must be burdened with a love interest element, even when it's obvious that it's not necessary. So we end up with totally unsavory (read, older man--younger woman, it's been done already!) pairings. But to Penn's credit, the relationship between Nicholson's and Wright-Penn's characters was more tastefully done than I've seen in other movies. Though if Nicholson had been more of a father/grandfather to Wright-Penn and the girl, it would have been just as believable.Okay, now to the ending. Many have argued for and against the ending. Though I appreciate Penn's attempt to not tie up all the loose ends and hand us the ending all tied up in a bow, the ending was still very unsatisfying. As I stated earlier, I like movies that are different; and I understand that as a viewer I must suspend belief for awhile. But it didn't seem so much like real life (as in, not all real life issues are tied up neatly) as it smacked of someone saying, &quot;Na, na, na, na, na. This ending is silly, but it's edgier because it's 180 degrees away from plausible.&quot; Please! I think a more creative ending could have been wrought from such a marvelous build-up.Disturbing most of all were the last frames. I still think the movie could have ended up there without the pathetic ending. But that's just my opinion. But this was still a good movie that shouldn't be missed.",4,Not formulaic.,994118400,"07 3, 2001",2001,1994,"['like', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'formula', 'like', 'movies', 'take', 'risks', 'like', 'movies', 'remain', 'couple', 'days', 'watch', 'regard', 'Pledge', 'right', 'target', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'director', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'lead', 'rest', 'cast', 'did', 'fabulous', 'job', 'film', 'Twice', 'thought', 'had', 'killer', 'figured', 'out', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', 'wrong', 'film', 'viewers', 'down', 'several', 'paths', 'only', 'find', 'facing', 'dead', 'end.My', 'only', 'movie', 'are', 'love', 'interest', 'Nicholson', 'Wright-Penn', 'characters', 'b', 'ending', 'will', 'never', 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'burdened', 'love', 'interest', 'element', 'even', 'when', 'obvious', 'not', 'necessary', 'end', 'up', 'totally', 'unsavory', 'read', 'older', 'man', 'younger', 'woman', 'been', 'done', 'already', 'pairings', 'Penn', 'credit', 'relationship', 'Nicholson', 'Wright-Penn', 'characters', 'was', 'more', 'tastefully', 'done', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'Nicholson', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'father/grandfather', 'Wright-Penn', 'girl', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'believable.Okay', 'now', 'ending', 'Many', 'have', 'argued', 'ending', 'appreciate', 'Penn', 'attempt', 'not', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'hand', 'ending', 'tied', 'up', 'bow', 'ending', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'unsatisfying', 'stated', 'earlier', 'like', 'movies', 'are', 'different', 'understand', 'viewer', 'must', 'suspend', 'belief', 'awhile', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'so', 'much', 'real', 'life', 'not', 'real', 'life', 'issues', 'are', 'tied', 'up', 'neatly', 'smacked', 'someone', 'saying', 'quot', 'Na', 'na', 'na', 'na', 'na', 'ending', 'silly', 'edgier', '180', 'degrees', 'away', 'plausible.', 'quot', 'Please', 'think', 'more', 'creative', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'wrought', 'such', 'marvelous', 'build-up.Disturbing', 'most', 'were', 'last', 'frames', 'still', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'there', 'pathetic', 'ending', 'just', 'opinion', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed']",N/A
