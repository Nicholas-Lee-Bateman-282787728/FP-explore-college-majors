1018246,A1NOLEWY3EBW01,B000I0RNYI,683,"[0, 1]","A lot of U.S. horror films these days are remakes of Asian horror films, this one being a remake of the 2001 J-horror film ""Kairo"". This film had a plot that could have been used differently, but since it wasn't, it really doesn't break a single mold. It basically is the mold. It's about a virus that breaks loose, causing anybody using electronic devices or anybody in a Wi-Fi area, to get their life sucked out of them from these-looking holographic-ish creatures, causing them to basically commit suicide. Maybe the film should have just been about contacting the dead through electronic devices. It sounds a bit better at least. The film did have some good and scary pop-outs though, but the whole story and ending, were really neurotic. It wasn't anything shocking. It was actually really dumb. Altogether, it was a pretty horrible movie. About as horrible as ""One Missed Call"", which I'm pretty sure even the original Japanese versions of both those movies are horrible, too, so I guess it doesn't really matter. Anyway, you should probably skip ""Pulse"".",1,Yet another Japanese horror film remake,1301443200,"03 30, 2011",2011,1061,"['lot', 'U.S.', 'horror', 'films', 'days', 'are', 'remakes', 'Asian', 'horror', 'films', 'one', 'being', 'remake', '2001', 'J-horror', 'film', 'Kairo', 'film', 'had', 'plot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'differently', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', ""n't"", 'break', 'single', 'mold', 'basically', 'mold', 'virus', 'loose', 'causing', 'anybody', 'using', 'electronic', 'devices', 'anybody', 'Wi-Fi', 'area', 'get', 'life', 'sucked', 'these-looking', 'holographic-ish', 'creatures', 'causing', 'basically', 'commit', 'suicide', 'Maybe', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'about', 'contacting', 'dead', 'electronic', 'devices', 'bit', 'better', 'least', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'good', 'scary', 'pop-outs', 'whole', 'story', 'ending', 'were', 'really', 'neurotic', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'shocking', 'was', 'actually', 'really', 'dumb', 'Altogether', 'was', 'pretty', 'horrible', 'movie', 'as', 'horrible', 'One', 'Missed', 'Call', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'even', 'original', 'Japanese', 'versions', 'movies', 'are', 'horrible', 'too', 'guess', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'Anyway', 'should', 'probably', 'skip', 'Pulse']",N/A

Sure it's another American remake of an Asian horror film, but that's not necessarily a bad thing when it's done well. People complained this film had a jumbled plot and it was boring, it does have a jumbled plot, but I really got into it from the get-go. Still, I would have to caution anyone who watches it, but if you like horror films that are out of the ordinary, Pulse is a good rent.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Matty and her friends are basically normal college kids. Between studying, there's their active social life through hanging out, texting, and talking to each other in chatrooms online. But Matty notices something strange about her boyfriend Josh; he isn't acting like himself and doesn't return her calls. When she goes over to his apartment to investigate, it's a filthy mess, and then Josh suddenly hangs himself with a phone chord. No one knows exactly why he killed himself, but answers start to pop up when a guy named Dexter buys Josh's old computer from the apartment. He finds a video showing different people killing themselves on a webcam and that Josh kept a video diary. Meanwhile, Matty's life is going straight to hell. People are disappearing and another person commits suicide when she's around. Then her friends start dying around her after being attacked by cyber ghosts that are infecting computers all over the world. Now Matty and Dexter must unravel what's going on, why, and how to stop it.MUSIC: This music has a nice creepy vibe that fits well with it. Too bad it comes and goes and isn't there all the time.ACTION: This film actually provides a sense of fear and dread and is executed quite well. I loved the special effects used in this film and really liked how the set pieces for the film were designed along with the ghosts. This is one of the few horror films that actually gave me a true sense of fear and dread.ACTING: The actors seemed fairly convincing, even the lead actress Kristen Bell was good, something that can be rarely said about women in horror films. She seemed very convincing and played her role quite well. For the most part the actors were good, and any actors that weren't quite on par with the good ones died off quickly. However, there were some moments of bad acting and dialogue, but not from the main characters. Overall, the acting is quite good.OVERALL: Rental. I loved this film, but people are mixed about it. If you're tired of the usual crappy slasher films, then Pulse may provide a good time.THE GOOD: The acting, the music, the moments that fill you with despair, the set and monster designs, and the special effects.THE BAD: The film does get a bit boring and some moments of bad acting and dialogue.",5,A MISUNDERSTOOD AND UNDERAPPRECIATED FILM  9 OUT OF 10,1243555200,"05 29, 2009",2009,2758,"['was', 'disappointed', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Pulse', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'loved', 'film', 'Sure', 'American', 'remake', 'Asian', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'when', 'done', 'well', 'People', 'complained', 'film', 'had', 'jumbled', 'plot', 'was', 'boring', 'have', 'jumbled', 'plot', 'really', 'got', 'get-go', 'Still', 'would', 'have', 'caution', 'anyone', 'who', 'like', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'ordinary', 'Pulse', 'good', 'rent.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'Matty', 'friends', 'are', 'basically', 'normal', 'college', 'kids', 'Between', 'studying', 'active', 'social', 'life', 'hanging', 'out', 'texting', 'talking', 'other', 'chatrooms', 'online', 'Matty', 'notices', 'something', 'strange', 'boyfriend', 'Josh', ""n't"", 'acting', ""n't"", 'return', 'calls', 'When', 'apartment', 'investigate', 'filthy', 'mess', 'then', 'Josh', 'suddenly', 'phone', 'chord', 'one', 'exactly', 'why', 'killed', 'answers', 'start', 'pop', 'up', 'when', 'guy', 'named', 'Dexter', 'Josh', 'old', 'computer', 'apartment', 'video', 'showing', 'different', 'people', 'killing', 'webcam', 'Josh', 'kept', 'video', 'diary', 'Meanwhile', 'Matty', 'life', 'going', 'straight', 'hell', 'People', 'are', 'disappearing', 'person', 'commits', 'suicide', 'when', 'around', 'Then', 'friends', 'start', 'dying', 'being', 'attacked', 'cyber', 'ghosts', 'are', 'infecting', 'computers', 'world', 'Now', 'Matty', 'Dexter', 'must', 'unravel', 'what', 'going', 'why', 'how', 'stop', 'it.MUSIC', 'music', 'nice', 'creepy', 'vibe', 'well', 'Too', 'bad', ""n't"", 'time.ACTION', 'film', 'actually', 'sense', 'fear', 'dread', 'executed', 'quite', 'well', 'loved', 'special', 'effects', 'used', 'film', 'really', 'liked', 'how', 'set', 'pieces', 'film', 'were', 'designed', 'ghosts', 'one', 'few', 'horror', 'films', 'actually', 'gave', 'true', 'sense', 'fear', 'dread.ACTING', 'actors', 'seemed', 'fairly', 'convincing', 'even', 'lead', 'actress', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'was', 'good', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'rarely', 'said', 'women', 'horror', 'films', 'seemed', 'very', 'convincing', 'played', 'role', 'quite', 'well', 'most', 'part', 'actors', 'were', 'good', 'actors', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'par', 'good', 'ones', 'died', 'off', 'quickly', 'However', 'were', 'moments', 'bad', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'not', 'main', 'characters', 'Overall', 'acting', 'quite', 'good.OVERALL', 'Rental', 'loved', 'film', 'people', 'are', 'mixed', ""'re"", 'tired', 'usual', 'crappy', 'slasher', 'films', 'then', 'Pulse', 'may', 'provide', 'good', 'time.THE', 'GOOD', 'acting', 'music', 'moments', 'fill', 'despair', 'set', 'monster', 'designs', 'special', 'effects.THE', 'BAD', 'film', 'get', 'bit', 'boring', 'moments', 'bad', 'acting', 'dialogue']",N/A

This movie might have done the same for Kristen Bell but, alas, it is not up to the standards (such as they are) of ""The Grudge"" or the Naomi Watts vehicle ""The Ring"".  The plot is jumbled, never fully explained, and more repulsive than scary.  As has become common in horror movies, the entire film (either through lighting or film-processing) appears as if shot under flourescent lamps that wash out colors and are extremely unflattering to the actors; every tiny imperfection of the flesh is exaggeratedly clear and distinct.  The actors' makeup hides nothing yet is itself grotesquely obtrusive.  Kristen Bell can surely be more beautiful than this on the big screen.  She manages to project some of her intrinsic charm despite the obstacles, but it is overcome by the general dreariness.  The movie, supposedly set on campus in Columbus Ohio, seems to have been shot in some neo-Stalinist architectural hell, perhaps in Eastern Europe.  I'm sure Ohio State was never like this.  Until near the end there are only four or five locations among which the movie cycles repetitively back and forth in a distinctly low-budget manner.

1018251,AV30RYVPJJJ34,B000I0RNYI,Alexander Stephen Brown,"[5, 9]","Ok, this review has no reflection on the writer or actors/acteresses.  The plot was good, the acting decent, but filming sucked.  This is so bubble gummy anyone who is thirteen years old or younger would enjoy.  I will list my reasons why.1: WHAT IS UP WITH THE METAL SCREECH IN EVERY HORROR MOVIE BEFORE SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS?  The metal screech isn't scary its annoying and it needs to be stopped.  Did we hear a metal screech in The Hills Have Eyes, Hostel, High Tension, The Grudge, or The Ring, no we didn't.2: THE EFFECTS SUCKED! I felt like I was watching a cartoon.  Listen take notes from old school.  The Exorcist, Jaws, Cujo, The Shining, Alien, Candyman, or Hellraiser,none of these movies were animated by computers, they used old school effects that looked real.  It pisses me off that Hollywood is so sold out that people cant dig into their pockets and come up with an effect that looks real or half way decent.3: WHAT THE HELL IS WITH THE FLASHBACKS AND IRRITATING BLUE FILTER? This is so distracting, every flashback or dream had that blasted metal screech. ANNOYING!  Also the film jumped around it reminded me of a music video from the 90's.For future work please document the hard works of the following writers/directors: Alexandre Aja, Eli Roth, Miike, Clive Barker, Stephen King excluding Dreamcatcher and many more.

That it is the worst remake to come along in quite sometime, if not the overall worst film ever made, a huge disappointment and a waste of celluloid. Well, in over thirty years of watching horror movies, I'm here to tell you that I've seen far worse that are more deserving of such -ahem- praise. The tale is about Mattie who is in the next room when her boy friend, Josh, commits suicide which is happening alot on their college campus and in several other areas across the country. She and her remaining friends begin finding out about what's behind the suicides which are ghosts who are coming back to earth via electronic means and sucking the life force out of folks like Josh who happen to be accessing their computers, cell phones, PDAs, etc(anything electric). Mattie ends up meeting Dexter who newly owns Josh's computer. Both figure out that a guy named Ziegler is responsible for starting everything in the first place and that Josh was trying to fix the problem before hanging himself. That's, ultimately, when both can either save the world or let it be taken over by the ghosts. Sadly, this is where the movie falls and becomes a disappointment.Personally, I thought the movie was alot better than some of the other drivel passing for American remakes of Japanese horror movies. Even though the finale was anti-climatic, it was still worth watching. Do I recommend it? Well, I'd recommend the original Kairo first...but yes.

1018257,A3LPD7NTGFH7V4,B000I0RNYI,bowery boy,"[5, 7]","I had high hopes for Pulse. I really did.  I loved the quiet subtlety and surreal creepiness of Kairo, the Japanese original, and thought the remake could only make a good thing better.  Boy, was I wrong.With the exception of a few key scenes lifted directly from the original(the woman walking in slowmo, the girl distengrating into ash, the crashing plane), the American remake does not resemble Kairo at all.One of the key complaints of Pulse is that the plot is disjointed and ambiguous.  Kairo, the Japanese version, is even more ambiguous.  Nothing is explained at all: the websites, the red tape, the spirits.  The ambiguity of the plot added an extra element of creepiness, almost as if this was happening to you and you have no idea why.  It also left the plot up to your own interpretation and had a fairly bleak ending (which I liked).  Essentially, the plot to Kairo is the afterlife is finite and souls have nowhere to go so they use modern technology to manifest themselves in the real world by causing the living to become depressed and suicidal.With the remake Pulse, the ambiguity of the plot combined with the over explanation of everything that happens results in a jumbled mess with lukewarm scares. The souls are changed into evil spirits wanting human lifeforce. A weird computer virus is introduced and more characters were added which did nothing to further the story.  The psychiatrist character annoyed me to no end, the dream sequences were pointless and if I'm not mistaken the scene when the person jumps off the tower was completely cut (another scene lifted from Kairo).  I liked the gray and blue lighting reminiscent of The Ring remake but everything was grungy and dirty. Apartments were dark and dusty, bathrooms were mildewy and grimy.  The special effects were excellent but were squandered away on a poorly written and badly acted movie. It was more entertaining watching the group of kids in front of me react to the movie than it was watching the movie.

In my opinion ""Pulse"" is more of a suspense movie than a horror movie. I don't like scary movies at all so this works out great for me. I loved all of the actors in this movie. They are very believable. I was a little surprised at the end of the movie. Most movies go for the happy ever after, or you think the worst is over, but not this one.

This actually could have been pretty good if the creators were more concerned with telling the horror story at hand, instead of making sure they could get a PG-13 rating and make more money from teenagers.The best thing about PULSE is that they had the great sense to give KRISTEN BELL from Veronica Mars the title role. Understandably, PULSE is way beneath her. This girl can sing, dance and carry a television series, but she is pretty well wasted with this boring piece of film.The movie is actually fairly good as Mattie (Bell) struggles to uncover why her boyfriend has slipt into a deep depression and seclusion. She enters his deteriated apartment and watches him emerge from behind a sheet of plastic. From that moment on, the film drags and bores with mild scares and the same technology kills theme we saw in THE RING.We get an old man's head under bath water, we get arms and legs flailing around in a dryer, we get a large face puzzle sent through a computer printer and we get ghosts standing around being ghostly.Ultimately, PULSE just plain falls flat as a movie that didn't push the envelope far enough. The characters trudge around in the dark throughout the entire film, seemingly avoiding the fate of the rest of the world, despite being the closest to the source, and ultimately disappoints.Finally, this is just another film in a long slew of disappointing remakes from Japan that are tagged with a PG-13 rating and have only one purpose... to get teenagers money.",2,One too many PG-13 Japanese Horror remakes,1169424000,"01 22, 2007",2007,1503,"['sad', 'thing', 'actually', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'good', 'creators', 'were', 'more', 'concerned', 'telling', 'horror', 'story', 'hand', 'instead', 'making', 'sure', 'could', 'get', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'teenagers.The', 'best', 'thing', 'PULSE', 'had', 'great', 'sense', 'give', 'KRISTEN', 'BELL', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'title', 'role', 'Understandably', 'PULSE', 'way', 'girl', 'can', 'sing', 'dance', 'carry', 'television', 'series', 'pretty', 'well', 'wasted', 'boring', 'piece', 'film.The', 'movie', 'actually', 'fairly', 'good', 'Mattie', 'Bell', 'uncover', 'why', 'boyfriend', 'slipt', 'deep', 'depression', 'seclusion', 'deteriated', 'apartment', 'emerge', 'sheet', 'plastic', 'moment', 'film', 'drags', 'bores', 'mild', 'scares', 'same', 'technology', 'kills', 'saw', 'THE', 'RING.We', 'get', 'old', 'man', 'head', 'bath', 'water', 'get', 'arms', 'legs', 'flailing', 'around', 'dryer', 'get', 'large', 'face', 'puzzle', 'sent', 'computer', 'printer', 'get', 'ghosts', 'standing', 'being', 'ghostly.Ultimately', 'PULSE', 'just', 'plain', 'falls', 'flat', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'push', 'envelope', 'far', 'enough', 'characters', 'trudge', 'around', 'dark', 'entire', 'film', 'seemingly', 'avoiding', 'fate', 'rest', 'world', 'being', 'closest', 'source', 'ultimately', 'disappoints.Finally', 'just', 'film', 'long', 'slew', 'disappointing', 'remakes', 'Japan', 'are', 'tagged', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'purpose', 'get', 'teenagers', 'money']",N/A
1018264,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000I0RNYI,Chris Pandolfi,"[9, 12]","A very noticeable feature of ""Pulse"" is its consistently monochromatic color scheme; every shot is drenched in grainy, unpleasing shades of blue and gray. It gave the film quite a surreal quality, as if it were filmed with an obsolete form of celluloid. What a perfect look for a horror movie, especially for one that revolved around computer technology and online video feeds. It works even better when a series of cyberspace ghosts are added to the mix. We never get a real sense of what they look like (which I found effective), but based on some very distinct glimpses, I gathered that they're pale, grayish figures, and they flicker in and out of our world like random computer glitches. Their presence gave legitimacy to the moody visuals, and that made the movie much more entertaining. I also enjoyed the dialogue; it remained true to horror movies without getting hokey. And no wonder; the screenplay was co-written by Wes Craven, a true master at creating believable dialogue.In the tradition of films like ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge,"" ""Pulse"" is an American remake of a Japanese horror movie. ""Kairo""--released in 2001 and directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa--was just as much a social statement as it was a supernatural thriller, focusing on isolation in the midst of a highly technological world. This emphasis on humanity could be one of the reasons why the American version was at times is a little difficult to follow; it was as if certain things were purposely meant to be ambiguous, despite the fact that the audience is dying to know what the hell is going on. Spirits are entering the world of the living via the Internet, evil spirits that supposedly want life again. Even though their motive is not exactly crystal clear, we are given enough of an explanation to keep us from lapsing into total confusion.It all starts when one of the ghosts attacks a college student named Josh (Jonathan Tucker). He had been wandering around a school library looking for someone named Douglas Zieglar (Kel O'Neill). Why he was attacked and what he wanted with Zieglar is unknown. All anyone does know is that he's now acting incredibly strange. Mattie (Kristen Bell) had been worried about him for days; not only has he not been returning her calls, he also leaves a single, ominous message on her answering machine. When she decides to see him, she fails to grasp why he's become so detached and why his apartment is in shambles. Papers are all over the floor. Dust and dirt coat everything. The food in the refrigerator is covered with maggots. There's even a dying cat in his closet (why this had to be included is beyond me). He ultimately commits suicide right in front of Mattie, which understandably leaves her angry, confused, and scared. Luckily, her friends--Izzie (Christina Milian), Stone (Rick Gonzales), and Tim (Sam Levine)--are all there to support her.One night, while sending each other instant messages over the Internet, someone with the screen ID ""Josh"" repeatedly sends each of these characters a message saying, ""Help me."" Initially unwilling to accept this as a supernatural occurrence, Mattie attempts to locate Josh's computer and find out who's behind the message. She tracks it down to a man named Dexter McCarthy (Ian Somerhalder), a gruff-looking loner type. During their meeting, Mattie discovers two things: 1) the computer is not even plugged in, and 2) it's still in the trunk of Dexter's car.That's when all the bad things start to happen, not just to the main characters, but to all of the American public, as well. The news continually reports a massive rise in suicides, none of which seem to be connected. But when Dexter opens Josh's hard drive, things start falling into place. It contains scores of video captures, all of which don't reveal too much to the audience other than some cryptic, disturbing imagery. We're led to believe that they're videos of people killing themselves. However, we never actually see it happen; what we do see are blank, expressionless faces, ones that seem genuinely tired of living. We also see the blurry image of a ghost in the background, hinting at some kind of possession. But the fact is that we don't really know what's going on; death is only insinuated, not spelled out for us.Still, the videos are effectively creepy in their simplicity; they each had a distinctly underground feel to them, as if a snuff website had been hacked into. What makes them even creepier is that they somehow get sent to everyone's computer, each time preceded by the question, ""Would you like to meet a ghost?"" When the link is clicked, the videos play, giving the ghosts access to our world. They then attack anyone in their path, sucking the will to live directly out of their bodies.The only thing that seems to keep these spirits at bay is special red tape, first seen covering the windows and door of Josh's bedroom. Three days before he died, he sent Mattie a three-pack of the stuff through the mail. Attached was a note saying, ""It keeps them out. Don't know why."" Maybe it interferes with their frequency. Maybe it's too strong to let electronic signals penetrate it.Maybe I'm analyzing the specifics too deeply; all that matters is that the tape is the one and only method of protection. (Did anyone but me see the connection to duct tape and a nuclear attack?) And people are going to need a lot of it. That's because the ghosts are spreading everywhere, and it's all because they can travel through a computer signal. The cities are no longer safe, and panic inevitably ensues. Ultimately, the survivors are forced to flee towards technology-free areas called dead zones (which is a fancy name for an undeveloped area). Only one hope remains: a computer virus that Josh had been developing. If Dexter and Mattie can locate Zieglar and upload the virus into their city's hard drive, things just might go back to normal.Will they succeed? I obviously can't say, and I'm sure most people won't find that aspect of the story interesting. However, the fact that this remake is also making a social statement can't be easily overlooked. Technology is very much the enemy in this story; the ghosts use it purely as a means of control and domination over those that are living. The symbolism in ""Pulse"" is in no way subtle. Granted, the message it's giving isn't exactly new. But the way it's given certainly is, and I think that's what I liked the most about it. Yes, it seems like an average, meaningless horror movie on the surface, but underneath, I think it's actually trying to say something.However, it's open for debate whether or not it's trying to say something important. It may not be saying anything at all; maybe it truly is just a meaningless horror film, solely created to scare the audience. ""Pulse"" doesn't leave you with definite answers, even when explanations are given. The plot is a mixture of pop out scares, psychological analyses, and technological phobias, all of which initially seem incompatible but eventually come together nicely. If it weren't for the fact that there's no gore, sex, or nudity, I could say that there's something in it for every kind of horror movie fan. But that's all right; much like life, you have to take what's offered and make the best of it. This is a very adequate horror movie, and it's sure to please anyone looking for a decent ghost story.",4,Ghosts in the Machine,1155254400,"08 11, 2006",2006,7366,"['very', 'noticeable', 'feature',

First, it was pushed back on the release schedule, then not screened for critics, then ravaged by critics. When I told my friend at work that I was going to see it I was accused of being stupid and having the hots for Kristen Bell. And while both of those things may be true, my system for selecting movies is 100% random (lots of coin tosses are involved), so there was no stopping me. What I found was a serviceable genre film that at least had enough box office strength to fill the Times Square theatre I saw it in. However, despite a few interesting ideas ""Pulse"" is a minor failure. Kristen Bell, one of our brightest young actresses, helps make the point that TV is a more relevant medium than film in 2006. Why watch her play an idiot on the big screen when you can watch her play a smart, confident, funny female role model on the small screen? But horror is the new comedy and people didn't show up for a female role model. People do show up to be part of a communal experience in which you don't watch the movie, you experience it.The film seemed to be going for a creepy vibe as opposed to a downright scary or violent one. For most of the film this vibe worked. I didn't care about the characters, but I did care about the world they inhabited. I especially liked the use of red to enhance to mood. The plot involves a group of vapid teenagers who succumb to creatures that are sneaking through the internet. Unfortunately, it doesn't always make sense. Some characters go live in another dimension, some vanish into thin air, some develop nasty black stains all over their body. I was scared a few times but never felt as though director Jim Sonzero earned them. The scares were telegraphed from a mile away and I blame the theatre atmosphere more than filmmaking skills for those scares. Had I been watching this film on DVD the number of scares I experienced would probably have been zero.The main point of the film is clearly to indict our not too bright younger generation and their over-reliance on communication technology. Early on Mattie (Bell) proclaims that her relationship with her boyfriend had been reduced to text messaging, and that she is avoiding her mother's phone calls.  In other words, she is sleepwalking through her relationships, the most human or human experiences. And modern technology is helping her do this. Then later, when the characters start being struck by the internet monsters they become zombiefied shells of humanity, and then they die. The point is really driven home by the fact that Mattie is constantly carrying around her cell phone (like all teens and 20-somethings I know). That a certain cell phone provider obviously paid for product placement is beyond ironic. ***",3,If the Internet is Evil. . .,1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,2825,"['Going', 'Pulse', 'expectations', 'had', 'film', 'possible', 'Worst', 'Movie', 'Year', 'candidate', 'First', 'was', 'pushed', 'back', 'release', 'schedule', 'then', 'not', 'screened', 'critics', 'then', 'ravaged', 'critics', 'When', 'told', 'friend', 'work', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'was', 'accused', 'being', 'stupid', 'having', 'hots', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'things', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'system', 'selecting', 'movies', '100', '%', 'random', 'lots', 'coin', 'tosses', 'are', 'involved', 'so', 'was', 'stopping', 'What', 'found', 'was', 'serviceable', 'genre', 'film', 'least', 'had', 'enough', 'box', 'office', 'strength', 'fill', 'Times', 'Square', 'theatre', 'saw', 'However', 'few', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'Pulse', 'minor', 'failure', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'one', 'brightest', 'young', 'actresses', 'helps', 'make', 'point', 'TV', 'more', 'relevant', 'medium', 'film', '2006', 'Why', 'watch', 'play', 'idiot', 'big', 'screen', 'when', 'can', 'watch', 'play', 'smart', 'confident', 'funny', 'female', 'role', 'model', 'small', 'screen', 'horror', 'new', 'comedy', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'female', 'role', 'model', 'People', 'do', 'show', 'up', 'be', 'part', 'communal', 'experience', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'experience', 'it.The', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'going', 'creepy', 'vibe', 'opposed', 'downright', 'scary', 'violent', 'one', 'most', 'film', 'vibe', 'worked', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'characters', 'did', 'care', 'world', 'inhabited', 'especially', 'liked', 'use', 'red', 'enhance', 'mood', 'plot', 'group', 'vapid', 'teenagers', 'who', 'succumb', 'creatures', 'are', 'sneaking', 'internet', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'sense', 'characters', 'go', 'live', 'dimension', 'vanish', 'thin', 'air', 'develop', 'nasty', 'black', 'stains', 'body', 'was', 'scared', 'few', 'times', 'never', 'felt', 'director', 'Jim', 'Sonzero', 'earned', 'scares', 'were', 'telegraphed', 'mile', 'away', 'blame', 'theatre', 'atmosphere', 'more', 'filmmaking', 'skills', 'scares', 'Had', 'been', 'watching', 'film', 'DVD', 'number', 'scares', 'experienced', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'zero.The', 'main', 'point', 'film', 'clearly', 'indict', 'not', 'too', 'bright', 'younger', 'generation', 'over-reliance', 'communication', 'technology', 'Early', 'Mattie', 'Bell', 'relationship', 'boyfriend', 'had', 'been', 'reduced', 'text', 'messaging', 'avoiding', 'mother', 'phone', 'other', 'words', 'sleepwalking', 'relationships', 'most', 'human', 'human', 'experiences', 'modern', 'technology', 'helping', 'do', 'Then', 'later', 'when', 'characters', 'start', 'being', 'struck', 'internet', 'monsters', 'become', 'zombiefied', 'shells', 'humanity', 'then', 'die', 'point', 'really', 'driven', 'home', 'fact', 'Mattie', 'constantly', 'carrying', 'cell', 'phone', 'teens', '20-somethings', 'know', 'certain', 'cell', 'phone', 'provider', 'obviously', 'paid', 'product', 'placement', 'ironic', '***']",N/A

1018268,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000I0RNYI,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 5]","The title notwithstanding, this film barely has a pulse of its own.  What should have been an exciting thriller somehow comes across as one of the most boring apocalyptic films I've ever seen.  The writers and directors were totally focused on the characters fighting to keep their wills to live from being sucked right out of their bodies - but what about my will to live?  As a viewer, I was fighting to survive, as well.  With electronic ghosts of ill-defined boredom closing in on me with each passing minute and a maze of loose ends to navigate along my way, I consider myself lucky to have come out the other side with my sanity intact.So, what is this Pulse, anyway?  Well, if you don't know, the movie surely isn't going to tell you - not until you're closing in on the end of it, anyway.  By then, you won't even care.  Sealing yourself in a small area with red tape keeps the pulse out, though, for what it's worth.  Personally, I didn't have a problem with the pulse - not as long as it kept eliminating such uninteresting characters as you'll find littering this film.  The most comatose of the bunch is Josh (Jonathan Tucker), the dumb hacker who manages to unleash this whole business on the world in the first place.  Mattie (Kristen Bell) could use some serious training in the art of applying mascara, but you still wouldn't think the girl would be hard up enough to actually like this dweeb.  Through the magic of cyberspace, Josh can't stop being annoying even in death, which leads Mattie and her gang of college buddies into this whole pulse business.  Then, before you can say Bob's your uncle, the whole world is full of people either missing or walking around as empty shells of themselves (which actually sounds a lot like real life, come to think of it).  So - you guessed it - it's up to Mattie and her new hacker friend to basically save the world.But how do you stop the pulse, especially when no one in the movie has really bothered to explain just what the heck it is, anyway?  Ah, there's the rub.  The writers, I'm sad to say, decide to take the easy way out, so don't plan on a wham bam ending to come along and suddenly make you want to stand up and cheer.  They don't even bother to address one of the seemingly important secondary plot points they kept bringing up all through the film.  Why introduce something into a film on several occasions if you aren't going to follow up on it at all?Pulse is a sad case of the ""if you can't beat them, remake them syndrome"" sweeping Hollywood in the last few years.  In this case, even Wes Craven seems to recognize the fact that Asian horror is far superior to American horror.  I haven't seen the Asian film that Pulse was based on, but it had to have a stronger story that this film did.  Hollywood tends to grab an Asian film, disembowel it of all its juicy story goodness (substituting a hefty helping of CGI effects in its place), and expect it to be a success.  Maybe someday they'll all figure out that this strategy just doesn't work.  No matter how spiffy the CGI is, Pulse's special effects still cry ""The Ring"" in most viewers' ears.  Let me completely doom this movie's prospects for you by comparing it to Fear Dot Com - remember how awful that was and how completely let down you felt after watching that trainwreck of a film?  You're going to feel the same way about Pulse.

Likewise, I enjoy many of the American adaptations (""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge""). But this film (much like the adaptation of Dark Water) simply misses the mark.Kristen Bells' performance is flat and uninspired. I see on IMDB that she is a television actress . . . it shows. She adds nothing to the film. And, while she may have been a fine minor character, she could not carry the film as a lead. On the other hand, Samm Levine proves himself worthy of the ""big-screen"" . . . though underwritten, his part was well-executed (pun intended). . . I hope to see more of this young actor in future films!Though seemingly original (to American audiences) the overall theme of the film is flawed. We typically do not see invasion/infection films which involve specters, ghouls, ghosts, or the undead. It is a clash of the public and the private  . . . and while this is quietly reflected in the theme of technology invading our living space, it is not thoroughly expressed. Hence, the films reads as two sub-genres uncomfortably mashed together. Certainly, this is a theme which could have worked . . . it could have been horrific . . . and that is the problem.

But, as ghost stories go, this one didn't.  The whole concept of an invasion of spirits, using technology as their way into this world, is puzzling to say the least.  There are far easier ways to gain egress than waiting for someone to use their computer in just the manner needed to open the way.  I kept thinking, what was the theme of this movie anyway, misery loves company?  Why was the sole intent of these malevolent spirits to infect the living and make them want to die?  We can't have life anymore so no one else should have it either.  That seems a rather abstract purpose.  Say they got their way and everyone living is suddenly dead, now what?  As a plot, there's nowhere to go with this type of story.  And that's the problem with this movie, there's far too many question and precious little in the way of answers.  To start with, too much red tape.  Are these spirits traveling here via sound waves or light waves?  Technology gets the blame no matter what, that's a convenient scapegoat.  Technology/progress has always held a negative connotation by those who would rather we kept everything the same, always.  Using that thin thread of mistrust as a basis for a ghost story is patently ridiculous.  Is technology the new boogeyman?  There are certainly enough movies maintaining that it is.  For me, it's far scarier being without it than utilizing it on a daily basis to make life easier.I just couldn't take this movie seriously.  To put it on a basic level, it just wasn't scary; it didn't offer anything fresh.  I don't fault the actors, just the premise.

1018279,ALR1CN6DL50DA,B000I0RNYI,Felixpath,"[33, 41]","""Pulse"" comes breezing into theaters as the latest remake of a Japanese horror film. J-horror is lucrative these days, as was demonstrated by ""The Ring,"" ""The Grudge,"" and their sequels. Problem is, something keeps getting lost in translation. In general, Japanese horror films (like much of Japanese culture) involve the clash between the old and the new, between tradition and technology. In ""The Ring,"" a vengeful ghost implanted itself, virus-like, on a VHS tape. In ""The Grudge,"" a jealous murder caused an ordinary house to become possessed by a force of supernatural fury. But while the original films are based around understatement and slowly-mounting terror, the American versions tend to abandon that for a slick production design and lots of ""Boo!"" moments. While watching ""Pulse,"" all I could think was, same old, same old.The plot is barely coherent, but I'll do my best. Kristen Bell (from ""Veronica Mars"") stars as a college student named Mattie who, along with some forgettable friends, goes to the single ugliest school in the country, a dismal maze of industrial concrete, crumbling plaster, rust, cracks, mold, and rot. Their geographic location (Columbus, OH) is never stated, probably to avoid offending the people who live there. You know how college students in movies always live in apartments that they could never afford in real life? ""Pulse"" overturns that rule by showing us apartments that only a college student would be desperate enough to live in. Everything seems to be in a state of decay -- including Mattie's boyfriend, Josh (Jonathan Tucker) who no one has seen for days. Mattie drops by his apartment to find the place in a disgusting state and Josh looking and acting like a zombie. While she's there, he wanders into a closet and hangs himself. We already know something of Josh's fate: in the film's opening scene, he goes poking around a spooky library and gets attacked by a flickering, half-seen creature. And there was something weird on his computer screen...While Mattie struggles to get over Josh's demise, more questions pop up. Why'd he do it? Why were his bedroom windows covered in red electrical tape? And if he's dead...who's IM'ing Mattie and her friends from his account? Mattie finds that his computer has vanished from the apartment, but eventually locates its new owner, a two-bit hacker named Dexter (Ian Somerhalder from ""Lost,"" playing more or less the same role). When Dexter plugs in Josh's machine, all he can find is a glowing line of text -- ""Do you want to meet a ghost?"" -- and some grainy, unsettling video footage of hollow-eyed kids in various stages of suicide. He and Mattie join forces to figure out what's going on, while the supporting characters are systematically dispatched by horror movie clich&eacute;s. (Never, never, NEVER do laundry alone in the basement!) Mattie herself keeps having encounters with the flickering phantoms, though they never actually attack her, maybe 'cause she has top billing. Meanwhile, fragments of news footage hint that something terrible is happening all over the country, maybe the world. Seems Josh did some hacking of his own, and opened the wrong file, and unleashed....ghosts, or demons, or something. The movie never pauses to explain itself; the new character who pops up near the end to reveal the source of the horror isn't helpful at all. Isn't it weird how characters in a movie can explain so much while explaining nothing? ""Silent Hill"" had the same problem. The ending of ""Pulse"" is supposed to be all grim and apocalyptic, but all I could think was: Yay! They're finally away from that butt-ugly school! I mean, if I had to attend there, I'd be pretty suicidal too.""Pulse"" isn't a total loss, though its best elements are still pretty derivative. The production design is moody and atmospheric, saturating the screen with melancholy blues and greens -- too bad ""The Ring"" already used that trick. The sound design is jagged and unsettling and serves to heighten what little tension there is -- but again, it's nothing that hasn't screeched and crackled and gurgled on soundtracks before. The special effects are sufficiently polished and provide us with some of the best moments, as the cyber-ghosts waver and jitter across the screen and their victims, sucked dry of their will to live, disintegrate into patches of black mold. The actors do the best they can with what little they've got -- I like Bell, Somerhalder, and Christina Milian (as Mattie's best friend), and I wished they were in a movie that gave them more than one emotional state. (Bell is ""Angsty,"" Milian is ""Sassy,"" and Somerhalder is ""Just Plain Out Of It."") Oh, and creepy character actor Brad Dourif (""Lord of the Rings,"" ""Child's Play,"" ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" and about a million other things) pops up in a random cameo, the subtext of which is ""Look! It's creepy character actor Brad Dourif in a random cameo!""I guess the bottom line is...stick with the Japanese original. ""Pulse"" isn't an awful movie, just an uninspired one. I can't think of anything in the film that I hadn't already seen. Decades from now, ""Pulse"" will probably be shown in film study classes as a prime example of how, at the start of twenty-first century, Hollywood had barely an original idea in its head. Maybe that's why the cyber-ghost-demon-things are so intent on wiping us out: hiding in their digital lair, spying on humanity, they said to each other, ""Enough is enough! Let's take over the planet before the humans make a bland, assembly-line horror movie about us!

Because of the low expectancy at the beginning of the movie, I ended up kind of liking the movie when it was over. No, it isn't a break through masterpiece, but it is an interesting movie. What I like about the film is how real it seemed, not the fact about the monsters are attacking people, but how no one knows what the things are and never find out either. If this was really happening, would we be able to find out where the monster came from? I doubt it. Pulse isn't a scary movie at all, but it is an interesting one for at least one viewing.

1018283,A1SHNOU2ODKIDG,B000I0RNYI,Gregorio,"[3, 4]","I figured this film would be a complete vomit when I got it for free while buying Rob Zombie's remake of HALLOWEEN.  The folks at DIMENSION must be pretty desperate to unload this nonsense if they have to give it away as a freebie.  Now I have to be bothered with getting this wretched, sensless, vile, waste of film out of my house because I would truly be embarrassed if anyone saw it in my home and thought that I was stupid enough to purchase it.This film represents EVERYTHING that is wrong with American Horror cinema today.  There is not a single interesting or original idea in the entire film.  How much did DIMENSION have to pay Earl Dietman of WIRELESS MAGAZINE for his cover quote ""Unlike ANY horror film you've seen before or will ever see!  The scariest movie of the year!""  Of course the film is exactly the same old boring, PG-13, CGI, desaturated nonsense that the movie-by-committee system has been throwing at us for the last four or five years.  We've all seen everything in this incoherent, ugly film OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  When will film studios get the idea that CGI digital visual effects are tired, boring and simply no longer interesting?CGI is not a substitute for IDEAS or SCARES, and of course PULSE has neither one.There is also that matter of the hideously ugly look of this film.  Every single frame from start to finish is tinted a cold blue, which is of course supposed to make the film look serious, artistic and important.  Naturally, anyone who isn't brain dead will recognize immediately that this is just a cheap gimmick to make it seem like the viewer is watching SOMETHING when instead we are really watching NOTHING AT ALL.  No ideas, no scares, no humor, no art, no likeable characters.  NOTHING  That is what this film is.  It is an abundance of nothing.Lets talk about the cast.  Suffice it to say that everyone sleepwalks through the entire film.  The entire cast as if they are on their way to a fashion magazine photo shoot, wearing clothes that would be impossible for the average American to afford.  Kristen Bell even takes a bath wearing full eye makeup (which is applied so heavily that she looks as if she has just time-warped out of a scene with Liz Taylor in CLEOPATRA).  There is nothing that could be remotely called acting going on anywhere in this botched incomprehesible mess.Sadly, it has become a safe bet that if a horror film is released in the United States by any major studio, or if the name Weinstein is associated with the film, then you will be watching an idiotic, CGI filled train wreck.  Now of course there are the occasional exceptions to that rule (DISTURBIA, CABIN FEVER, GRINDHOUSE) but in general, studio film making has sold out so bad I don't believe they even know what a real horror film looks like any more.  Too bad the folks at DIMENSION don't take a look at films being released by true independents like ASYLUM, RAPID HEART, ECHO BRIDGE etc.PULSE is certainly the worst film I've seen since SOUL SURVIVOR and in fact, it may be the worst film I've ever seen . . . EVER.  It is such an insulting, insipid, uninspired, artless heap of garbage.  A cinematic bowel movement.  Every single blue tinted, washed-out frame of it is an assault on what good film making should be.  It is really past time to simply boycott this stuff.  The fact that I got this film for free somehow makes it all even worse.  It is as if DIMENSION was saying, ""You simply have to watch this garbage, and we know that no individual with even the slightest big of discernment would ever pick up this stinking pile of dung, so we will give it you free of charge because we think you deserve it.""I can't believe I ranted this long over such a rotten film.

1018284,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000I0RNYI,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[8, 14]","Now, THIS is a scary film! I didn't have high hopes for this one, thinking that it wouldn't live up to the Japanese version it remakes. But I was pleasantly surprised to find Pulse a vastly entertaining horror flick; it contains taut pacing, a dense, ominous atmosphere, and a spookily rendered unveiling of its horror elements. I relished its against-all-odds, apocalyptic flavor. The premise, that of malevolent ghosts accessing the real world via our rapidly advancing communications technology, is an update (upgrade?) on the that age-old plot of spirits affecting us from beyond the grave. And when done with panache, great energy and earnest concerted effort by cast and crew - like in Pulse - it's a thing of horrific beauty.Pulse is the remake of the Japanese horror movie Kairo, directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa (Cure, Charisma, and Bright Future).  Kurosawa is known for eschewing obvious, traditional shock values and opting instead for an introspective, somewhat withdrawn, and unsettling style which seeps into the head and burrows under the skin. His favorite themes have to do with disaffection, the immersion or loss of identity, and how society ultimately affects us as individuals. Pulse, the American version, of course, dumbs it down enough for the mass consumers and somewhat reduces Kurosawa's film into a less contemplative but still exhilaratingly frightening boo-fest. Having said that, Wes Craven, who is credited with the American adaptation, does find sequences in the film to insert several searing images to reiterate Kurosawa's thoughtful conceits. Interspered throughout the horror are quick touches on the themes of desolation, alienation, our over-dependence on machines, and the individual loss of identity thru submergence in technology. Viewers of Kairo will, I believe, find this version rewarding and entertaining, even if, ultimately, it's from a common denominator level.This film echoes The Ring in the depiction of its pale, grainy, pixel-challenged apparitions, and The Terminator in its apocalyptic, end-of-the-world tone. From the opening shot, Pulse is in ""boo"" mode and consistently stays so for the entire film. The scares come fast and often, and while most of the set-ups are seen a mile away, the payoffs are nevertheless big and unnerving. I agree that the laundry room scene and the ghost car attack are damned intense. There's a scene involving a friend breaking into Josh's apartment and also a bathtub scene that I thought were pretty spooky.The actors are laudable. The star is obviously Kristen Bell (she of Veronica Mars fame), who plays Mattie; and she nicely carries the film. Her supporting cast also does a good job of keeping it down to earth, yet, when the scene calls for it, is able to reveal stark fear, without going over the top. Christina Milian as Mattie's best bud Izzy is endearing and sexy hot in her low hung jeans. Jonathan Tucker as the tortured Josh is particularly effective in his eerieness. The always reliable Ron Rifkin (Alias) has a small appearance as Mattie's psychologist. Ian Somerhalder, in my eyes, is decent as the stubbled Dexter.This is an excellent movie to take your buddies and is even a better date movie (I guarantee arms will be grabbed and crushed in vise-like grips many times, if you're into that). A friend of mine, in the midst of screening Pulse, started wondering about the ghosts' motivations and raison d'etre (""so they suck your life out, and then what?""). I slapped him on the head with a popcorn bucket. When a movie is this terrifyingly entertaining, you can forgive it a lapse or two, no?

As the rest of the kids go through their technologically-dependant lives, it soon becomes clear that there is some sort of Trojan Horse haunting them and giving them some form of the plague.From there the movie decays into a combination of ""The Ring"", ""The Grudge"", ""8MM"", and a poorly made bondage flick.  People die; shock scenes occur; spooky ghosts appear; and the only people that can escape are finally happy about their T-Mobile coverage area.If you can get past the complete plagiarism of several other movies, then the acting and special effects make the movie bearable and somewhat worthwhile.  The electronic ghosts are pretty cool, and the flickering lights gave me a slight case of epilepsy.

Pulse is really not a bad movie it is a decent flick. Like most teen Horrors minus the blood and gore.The plot and storyline for this movie is passable but so far fetched to the point that your eyes glaze over, your mind goes numb and you slump in your seat from sheer and slight boredom I feel the movie was comatose along making you wait for the good stuff just to abruptly take the spoon out of your mouth once you starting to get a taste for it. The movie plays in reverse in that it waits till the end to get your attention. There were many failed attempts at trying to be suspenseful, I thing the casting is at fault for that. Which is kind of strange because some of them are skilled actors. Kristen Bell as Mattie, along with Ian Somerhalder as Dexter acted sub par at best. Kristen Bell's character is introduced and seems like a lively, fun-loving girl. She quickly turns into an angry, angsty, and bitter character. Granted, the events that precede this sudden change would make anyone do an about-face, but it just didn't seem like she had any of that to begin with. In the beginning there seems to be a tight-knit group of four friends, two guys and two girls. The guys are barely given any screen time, it is only Mattie and Christina Milian as Izzy who matter but throughout this film you do have some empathy with some of the characters and it does succeed in scaring you for roughly 3/4 of its running time. Though when I say scared I don't mean terrified, rather, I mean your shocked and disturbed frequently and feel a dreaded suspense through large parts of its duration.While fans of blood and gore probably won't go nuts for it, those who enjoy a good creep-fest will be thrilled and chilled.

Kelly,"[1, 4]","A film that skirts uncomfortably close to ""date movie"" quality, with some excruciating bits of dialogue, usually expelled by blonde princess Kristen Bell who looks like daddy bought her an acting diploma. The cast at times seems like a second-string ""Dawson's Creek,"" which chips into the flow of an otherwise engrossing -- and satisfyingly creepy -- outing. The monster, (WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD) here represented by ghosts that have latched onto a new type of broadband and spread through computers like a virus, never devolves to the level of corny or boring, even if the premise seems a stretch. Examples of films that do stoop to that level are ""Thirteen Ghosts"" (take the special sunglasses off and the ghosts can't even mess with you) or ""The Descent"" (wherein once one of the hiker chicks decides to get their girl power on, she's tearing apart that sun-deprived beast with her fists, the gollums no more fearful than water balloons). It's hard to watch a technology-centric horror movie without think of ""Ringu,"" -- and ""Poltergeist"" could have been much more frightening under that director's wand -- because there's always that scene where the music is tweaking your eardrums with strands of anticipation, and you see a TV in a room and it's either showing static or there's a ghastly face on the screen, this time upgraded to a computer monitor. ""Pulse"" pays homage mostly, thankfully, to Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead."" By bringing in reports from the outside world, we are put inside their world: We are watching the same screen as the characters. These reports tell us the computer virus is spreading like wildfire and effectively turning everyone it touches into zombies: Their will to live is sapped once the ghost comes through the wires -- or wireless. And just as Romero was criticizing consumerism, director Jim Sonzero, albeit through Kiyoshi Kurosawa, who directed the original Japanese version, is commenting on man's abuse of nature, taken to mythic proportions like the story of Prometheus, as portrayed by Dr. Frankenstein.

Its Japanese origins show up in its lackluster pacing and its dependence on a group of pale, powerful, angry ghosts who can not be stopped.  Once I see that an American movie was based on a previously existing Japanese one, I sort of stop hoping for a happy ending, I already know everyone is going to die (unless there's a child in it who can somehow reach back to a dead child ghost and get them to stop harassing today's adults), and there are so many movies nowadays in which everyone dies, and the blue filter is pumped up to fill the screen with industrial angst, enough already.What a tragedy that low ratings cancelled TV's VERONICA MARS and stranded poor Kristen Bell in a movie career that does nothing but insult her.  It's sort of like what happened to Sarah Michelle Gellar ended, but SMG walked out of Buffy, so it's her own stupid fault, whereas if this were the best of all possible worlds VERONICA MARS would still be on the air, Logan and Piz perhaps squaring for an all-out competition now for Veronica's favors.  Instead we have PULSE.  It's sort of like a parody of VERONICA MARS' difficulties dealing with her mother.  Here we see the mother trying to call Mattie, Mattie trying to call the mother, then an hour later she tries again, then the movie forgets all about her.Please, someone, take poor Christina Milian out of the movies.  She can't really act and nobody should have to play that scene where she's in the laundry room, the washer opens from within, and a ghost or something invisible starts throwing her laundry, one item at a time, out of the washer into the floor, splat.  Splat.  Splat.  And that's her best scene!  It's another horror movie where every person of color goes long before the white people.  You'd think Hollywood would learn a lesson but oh, no.  The friends of color are seemingly there just to perish and give their white co-stars some good discovery scenes: ""Why, Izzie, why?""  ""No, Stone, no!""

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[1, 1]","For a film named ""Pulse"" and utilizing high-speed communications and modern technology as the catalyst for terror, this movie sure is a snoozer.  Let's face it folks, cellphones, computers, etc. are sure fun to mess with on your own, but they are downright boring to watch someone else use them in a film.  In ""Pulse,"" deadly, ghost-like beings have somehow figured out how to cross into our world via the internet, cellphones, etc.  When they make it to our side of the web, they suck the will to live out of their victims, eventually leading to suicide.  That's it in a nutshell.  It's boring, not scary at all, and full of modest performances from a cast headed up by Kristen Bell and Christina Milian.If you've read the Stephen King novel, ""Cell,"" you've already got the jist of what the writers (including Wes Craven, who's quickly losing his status in the horror world thanks to clunkers like this) are trying to tell people.  If we rely too much on technology, it will eventually bite us in the rear.  Of course, in King's book, cellphones are used to turn people into zombies, essentially ""rebooting"" their brains and downloading new information into them.  In ""Pulse,"" we have unexplained beings from another place (most likely Hell) who are out to take the lives of the living.  As in ""Cell,"" when our heroes reach ""dead zones,"" things get a little bit easier as far as the life-sucking part goes.  However, much like ""Cell,"" the viewer is given a bland resolution to the tale.This movie is just one of many remakes of Japanese horror flicks like ""The Ring 1 & 2"" and ""The Grudge 1 & 2.""  I've seen a few of the Japanese originals and most of the American remakes and I've learned one thing from them:  Japanese horror is boring and American retread horror is worse.  Don't get me wrong, I don't consider a film scary based on the amounts of blood and gore contained in them.  I base how scary a movie is on how suspenseful and terrifying it is.  In the case of the Japanese spookers and their American counterparts, neither are too scary.If you're bored and have nothing better to do, check out ""Pulse.""

1018303,AZ78HT7H9DVJG,B000I0RNYI,LARRY,"[0, 1]","*Pulse* was an ok movie.  I wasn't pleased with the loose ends in the story and the ending.  I was looking forward to see a scary movie.  (Is there no such thing as a scary movie these days?!?!)  The cover makes it look like you'll jump from your seat 3 feet high and scream your head off.  Alas, that was not to be.The movie opens with Josh looking for a fellow, Ziegler, in a dark library.  Now, why anyone look for someone in a library with the lights off?  Suddenly, a phantasmic face appears and attacks Josh.  We don't know what happened next.The next scene, we see Mattie with her friends at a bar.  She's worried about Josh.  She hasn't heard from him in days.  Apparently, they had a big fight and have broken up or on the verge of doing so.  The next day, Mattie goes to Josh's run-down apartment.Josh allows her to come in.  Mattie notices that he's lifeless like a zombie and his talks are enigmatic.  He tells her to wait in the living room while he goes to another room.  She takes a quick survey around the apartment.  There are maggots everywhere.  She hears muffled meows from somewhere and goes to investigate.  She discovers a bloody, emaciated cat.  (The movie never explained what the cat was doing there or why it was in that condition.  We don't even know if Josh ever had the cat as a pet.)  Next, she hears a noise in the next room where Josh went.  That's where she discovers that Josh committed suicide.Mattie cannot be comforted over Josh's suicide.  She blames herself for not recognizing the signs.  However, pretty soon, she starts to get messages from Josh.  Her friends are also getting messages from Josh.  It seems that Josh is communicating from ""the other side"".It looked like the movie was building up to a wonderful suspense, with some scary moments, but it never happened.  There were too many loose ends that made you wonder.  These little questions in your head do distract you from the movie.  For example, after Stone gets attacked by a ghost, Tim goes to check up on him.  When Tim arrives, he discovers Stone halfway merged with a wall, which he'll soon disappears into.  Again, no explanation of the merging with the wall.Eventually, Mattie tracks down Dexter, who bought Josh's computer from the landlady.  Dexter discovers Josh's video files.  From there, they were able to locate an address for Ziegler.  However, Ziegler doesn't really prove to be much help.  In fact, he's a cheesy paranoid character, which definitely didn't help the movie.  Ziegler only provides a brief vague background of how these ghosts came into being.  Ziegler had tampered with some unknown frequencies which released, with Josh's help, these ghosts into reality.  These ghosts have slowly been eating up humanity.Throughout the movie, Mattie notices that there are less and less people everywhere.  People are just simply disappearing...into ashes.  It seems that people are safe when they're in a ""dead zone"" (no electronic signal).Dexter discovered that Josh created a virus that would eradicate the ghosts.  Dexter and Mattie go to some basement to feed the virus into a computer central system.  Dexter uploads the virus.  It seems like it going to be a success.  However, the computer shuts down and reboots itself, rendering the virus useless.The apocalyptic ending was an ""OMG"" moment.

But that's where the positives end.I have never been a fan of `electronic horror', though certain Japanese films (such as `One Missed Call') do manage to keep my interest. Here, the story itself is ridiculous, as the world is being taken over by `something that escaped from a computer!'. Yeah, if that sounds bad, try watching TV's Kristen Bell (Veronica Mars) mouth the most idiotic dialogue ever heard (""I'm Scared, I really am"", ""Why did this have to happen? Why!?"" etc) and you have an idea of just how bad this is. Usually amazing Ian Somerhalder returns to the screen in a very boring role, and the movie follows the lead actress' attempts to solve the mystery and get out of town safe. To say this was an insult to ones' intelligence is an understatement.Another thing - is CG really dead? I mean, the effects here started off good, and then went spectacularly bad (such as a plane crashing - so obviously fake) that it was difficult to retain interest in the movie, even in a campy way. Sadly, this is no showcase for anyones' talents. The best part is the first five minutes where a boy is attacked by a `computer demon' in a library. Sad to say, it all went downhill from here.

I guess if you stop thinking that it is a remake and enjoy the film for what it is, it probably will be enjoyed more. But, that is just my opinion. I did enjoy this film for what it had to offer. It did have alot of scares and thrills to it. It definately had the flavor of the Ring and White Noise mixed into one. It was a little different to the horror genre and a welcomed one at that. Maybe everyone should try seeing the unrated version instead of complaining that it was rated PG-13. Again, that is just my opinion. What I definately do think is that the director should have left the deleted scenes in the movie. This would have given it a little bit more explaination to the film. I do recommend this film to anyone that wants to see a good horror flick with some good acting to it.

1018308,A17BUUBOU0598B,B000I0RNYI,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[0, 0]","Pulsemakes several of the typical mistakes that recent horror films seem to repeat.  Despite great cinematography and special effects work, the movie is saddled by a ridiculous script that works too hard explaining the back-story yet still winds up making no sense. What's worse, they obviously had a budget and several well known actors.  This could have been a good movie, but it succeeds only in startling those with jittery nerves.If I ever saw the original, I have since forgotten it or the differences are too many for me to draw the connection.  It doesn't really matter what this movie is based on.  It simply does not stand on its own.The GoodThe dark filming and subtle lighting of the film do deserve some credit.  They definitely add to the mood of the intersection between the worlds of the living and the dead.  Yes it has been done before, but achieving this look is still technically challenging.  The muted colors and darkened pallet are used in a way that actually aids in the story.  So kudos to the director of photography and the cinematography team.The special effects are also relatively well done. Although I still have a gripe in the fact that they are sometimes misused to create rippling and fuzzy fade-ins where the monsters or ghosts appear.  Still, that seems to be more of a flaw of editing or direction.  Whoever did the CGI work here deserves a lot of credit.  Unfortunately that is where the bulk of the positive ends.The Bad*Mild spoilers*The story focuses on some college friends in a small town where research into an expanded wireless communications band has allowed *creatures* or *ghosts* to cross over into the world of the living.  As more people commit suicide and as their friends disappear, our young heroine much search for the answer in the form of a computer virus to disable the servers that are allowing these creatures to cross into our dimension.  These creatures seek out the living to take their life force away.  Nothing about this story in and of itself is unacceptable.  This is horror after all.  But they go to great lengths to explain how this might be possible.  In fact, the excessive explanations of the impossible are coupled with some things that are never explained, like that silly red tape.  On top of that, some of the lines that are given to these actors make no sense in the context of the movie.The story line is so ridiculous as to prevent any rational person from suspending disbelief.  That's hard to do to a horror fan.  We can watch Mike Myers get shot 30 times and accept that he can get back up.  We are willing to accept space monsters coming to earth to eat us.  The fact that this story was so loosely written as to be unbelievable is terribly disappointing.And if you want your movies to be filled with action, be prepared for Achilles heel number two.  Not only is the plot silly, but the story takes forever to get there and drags on in an ineffective attempt to create angst or dread.Some of the acting is ok, but plenty of it is bad too.  And when you have terrible lines to deliver, it doesn't make acting any easier.  They definitely seemed to over-rely on the exaggerated scream here.*Mild Spoiler Ahead*If you know anything about technology, you will not want to watch this.  For example, there's a point where these creatures can apparently use cell phones to locate the living (apparently, they have access to CDMA and GSM technology).  The heroine stares at her phone and notices the bars as the radio bulletin warns against using computers or cell phones.  The monsters appear.  But once they get to a *dead zone* the monsters disintegrate.  Hmmmm.  Do you think you might want to turn your phone OFF???  Now I know where the idea for all those Verizon *dead zone* commercials came from.The movie also has an oversimplified ending.  The solution to the problem is both silly and poorly depicted.  Granted the action does pick up above the occasional ghost jumping out at you to startle you.  When you finally reach the conclusion, you will probably experience more laughter than dread.ConclusionIn my humble opinion, this movie was a missed opportunity.  If you are just looking for a few hours of mindless fun, this might still do it for you.  But if you know anything about how technology works, don't like slow moving movies, don't like dark noir movies and aren't easily startled by ghosts jumping out of nowhere, then this will bore you more than it will scare you.  And if you are critical of the many remakes of Japanese horror movies that don't live up to the originals, this probably fits in that group too.  Only see this if you have a free rental or it's on cable, but don't buy this DVD till you've seen the movie a few times.Enjoy.",2,"Pulse - Can't Speak For The Original, But The Remake Has Flat-lined",1223078400,"10 4, 2008",2008,4739,"['Pulsemakes', 'several', 'typical', 'mistakes', 'recent', 'horror', 'films', 'seem', 'repeat', 'great', 'cinematography', 'special', 'effects', 'work', 'movie', 'saddled', 'ridiculous', 'script', 'too', 'hard', 'explaining', 'back-story', 'yet', 'still', 'up', 'making', 'sense', 'What', 'worse', 'obviously', 'had', 'budget', 'several', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'movie', 'only', 'startling', 'jittery', 'nerves.If', 'ever', 'saw', 'original', 'have', 'forgotten', 'differences', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'draw', 'connection', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'what', 'movie', 'based', 'simply', 'not', 'stand', 'own.The', 'GoodThe', 'dark', 'filming', 'subtle', 'lighting', 'film', 'do', 'deserve', 'credit', 'definitely', 'add', 'mood', 'intersection', 'worlds', 'living', 'dead', 'Yes', 'been', 'done', 'achieving', 'look', 'still', 'technically', 'challenging', 'muted', 'colors', 'darkened', 'pallet', 'are', 'used', 'way', 'actually', 'story', 'So', 'kudos', 'director', 'photography', 'cinematography', 'team.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'also', 'relatively', 'well', 'done', 'still', 'have', 'gripe', 'fact', 'are', 'sometimes', 'misused', 'create', 'rippling', 'fuzzy', 'fade-ins', 'where', 'monsters', 'ghosts', 'appear', 'Still', 'be', 'more', 'flaw', 'editing', 'direction', 'did', 'CGI', 'work', 'here', 'lot', 'credit', 'Unfortunately', 'where', 'bulk', 'positive', 'ends.The', 'Bad*Mild', 'story', 'focuses', 'college', 'friends', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'research', 'expanded', 'wireless', 'communications', 'band', 'allowed', '*creatures*', '*ghosts*', 'cross', 'world', 'living', 'more', 'people', 'commit', 'suicide', 'friends', 'disappear', 'young', 'heroine', 'much', 'search', 'answer', 'form', 'computer', 'virus', 'disable', 'servers', 'are', 'allowing', 'creatures', 'cross', 'dimension', 'creatures', 'seek', 'out', 'living', 'take', 'life', 'force', 'away', 'Nothing', 'story', 'unacceptable', 'horror', 'go', 'great', 'lengths', 'explain', 'how', 'might', 'be', 'possible', 'fact', 'excessive', 'explanations', 'impossible', 'are', 'coupled', 'things', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'silly', 'red', 'tape', 'top', 'lines', 'are', 'given', 'actors', 'make', 'sense', 'context', 'movie.The', 'story', 'line', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'prevent', 'rational', 'person', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'hard', 'do', 'horror', 'fan', 'can', 'watch', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'get', 'shot', '30', 'times', 'accept', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'up', 'are', 'willing', 'accept', 'space', 'monsters', 'coming', 'earth', 'eat', 'fact', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'loosely', 'written', 'be', 'unbelievable', 'terribly', 'disappointing.And', 'want', 'movies', 'be', 'filled', 'action', 'be', 'prepared', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'number', 'two', 'Not', 'only', 'plot', 'silly', 'story', 'forever', 'get', 'there', 'drags', 'ineffective', 'attempt', 'create', 'angst', 'dread.Some', 'acting', 'ok', 'plenty', 'bad', 'too', 'when', 'have', 'terrible', 'lines', 'deliver', ""n't"", 'make', 'acting', 'easier', 'definitely', 'seemed', 'over-rely', 'exaggerated', 'scream', 'here', '*Mild', 'Spoiler', 'Ahead*If', 'know', 'anything', 'technology', 'will', 'not', 'want', 'watch', 'example', 'point', 'where', 'creatures', 'can', 'apparently', 'use', 'cell', 'phones', 'locate', 'living', 'apparently', 'have', 'access', 'CDMA', 'GSM', 'technology', 'heroine', 'phone', 'bars', 'radio', 'bulletin', 'using', 'computers', 'cell', 'phones', 'monsters', 'appear', 'once', 'get', '*dead', 'zone*', 'monsters', 'disintegrate', 'Hmmmm', 'Do', 'think', 'might', 'want', 'turn', 'phone', 'Now', 'know', 'where', 'idea', 'Verizon', '*dead', 'zone*', 'commercials', 'came', 'from.The', 'movie', 'also', 'oversimplified', 'ending', 'solution', 'problem', 'silly', 'poorly', 'depicted', 'Granted', 'action', 'pick', 'up', 'occasional', 'ghost', 'jumping', 'out', 'startle', 'When', 'finally', 'reach', 'conclusion', 'will', 'probably', 'experience', 'more', 'laughter', 'dread.ConclusionIn', 'humble', 'opinion', 'movie', 'was', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'are', 'just', 'looking', 'few', 'hours', 'mindless', 'fun', 'might', 'still', 'do', 'know', 'anything', 'how', 'technology', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'slow', 'moving', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'dark', 'noir', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'easily', 'startled', 'ghosts', 'jumping', 'nowhere', 'then', 'will', 'bore', 'more', 'will', 'scare', 'are', 'critical', 'many', 'remakes', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'originals', 'probably', 'group', 'too', 'Only', 'see', 'have', 'free', 'rental', 'cable', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'till', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'few', 'times.Enjoy']",N/A

1018310,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B000I0RNYI,Mel Odom,"[0, 1]","PULSE is yet another Japanese horror film remake, upgraded with state-of-the-art CGI and even bolstered with teen fave actors.  The story basically deals with a computer program that has proliferated through WiFi connections throughout the world (computers, handheld gaming systems, PDAs, telephones, etc) that access the internet.  The program allows evil spirits to enter our world and they do horrible and eerie things to anyone they come in contact with.Kristin Bell (VERONICA MARS) plays Mattie, the college student looking for answers for her boyfriend's suicidal hanging.  Ian Somerhalder (Lost) stars as Dexter, the living-on-his-wits guy who ends up being the hero lead.  The movie was directed by Jim Sonzero.  Horror-guru Wes Craven and Ray Wright wrote the screenplay.  The movie is based on Kiyoshi Kurosawa's KAIRU.The movie looks sharp and edgy, and the subtle loss of color throughout the film to where the final climatic moments are pretty much in black-and-white is really good.  Kristin Bell delivers a solid performance, but there's not much character to work with.  Somerhalder had to deal with much the same thing.  The soundtrack is awesome, offering some chilly bits that can frazzle the nerves if you're watching it alone in the dark (as I was).Although several effects in the movie are genuinely scary and stomach-turning, the overall experience just didn't live up to the hype.  Maybe I've seen too many horror movies over the years to be truly surprised, but I wanted something more from this film.  The movie never really explains where the ""dead,"" if that's what they are, came from.  Or why they wanted to suck the souls from the living.  Or anything in the way of truly scientific or supernatural.  The story just ground through till its inevitable conclusion with some neat effects and bits along the way.  (Such as the scene in the laundry room, which is probably the most powerful one in the whole movie.)PULSE is definitely worth a rental and a look, but not necessarily a keeper.  Except for the true horrorphile.  The special features, although not packed, are a welcome addition.  It was interesting to see some of the issues the filmmakers had to deal with, and how they shot some of the eerie stuff.",3,Interesting But Not Horrifying,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,2240,"['PULSE', 'yet', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'film', 'remake', 'upgraded', 'state-of-the-art', 'CGI', 'even', 'bolstered', 'teen', 'fave', 'actors', 'story', 'basically', 'computer', 'program', 'proliferated', 'WiFi', 'connections', 'world', 'computers', 'handheld', 'gaming', 'systems', 'PDAs', 'telephones', 'etc', 'access', 'internet', 'program', 'evil', 'spirits', 'enter', 'world', 'do', 'horrible', 'eerie', 'things', 'anyone', 'come', 'contact', 'with.Kristin', 'Bell', 'VERONICA', 'MARS', 'Mattie', 'college', 'student', 'looking', 'answers', 'boyfriend', 'suicidal', 'hanging', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'Lost', 'Dexter', 'living-on-his-wits', 'guy', 'who', 'up', 'being', 'hero', 'lead', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'Jim', 'Sonzero', 'Horror-guru', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Ray', 'Wright', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'based', 'Kiyoshi', 'Kurosawa', 'KAIRU.The', 'movie', 'sharp', 'edgy', 'subtle', 'loss', 'color', 'film', 'where', 'final', 'climatic', 'moments', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'black-and-white', 'really', 'good', 'Kristin', 'Bell', 'solid', 'performance', 'not', 'much', 'character', 'work', 'Somerhalder', 'had', 'deal', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'soundtrack', 'awesome', 'offering', 'chilly', 'bits', 'can', 'frazzle', 'nerves', ""'re"", 'watching', 'alone', 'dark', 'was', 'several', 'effects', 'movie', 'are', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'stomach-turning', 'overall', 'experience', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'Maybe', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'years', 'be', 'truly', 'surprised', 'wanted', 'something', 'more', 'film', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'where', 'dead', 'what', 'are', 'came', 'why', 'wanted', 'suck', 'souls', 'living', 'anything', 'way', 'truly', 'scientific', 'supernatural', 'story', 'just', 'ground', 'till', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'neat', 'effects', 'bits', 'way', 'Such', 'scene', 'laundry', 'room', 'probably', 'most', 'powerful', 'one', 'whole', 'movie', 'PULSE', 'definitely', 'worth', 'rental', 'look', 'not', 'necessarily', 'keeper', 'true', 'horrorphile', 'special', 'features', 'not', 'packed', 'are', 'welcome', 'addition', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'issues', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'deal', 'how', 'shot', 'eerie', 'stuff']",N/A

It does me good to see my Veronica Mars' heroine on the big screen where she attempts to command the stage in this lukewarm horror movie.Bell plays Mattie, a smart and witty girl who is dating a depressed and somewhat reclusive Josh...or so we are lead to believe. After Josh goes M.I.A. Mattie decides to visit him at his apartment to find him acting odd. He looks pale and lifeless as he tells Mattie to ""wait here"" while he commits suicide.Nothing new for our Mars' heroine right? She solved the death of Lily Kane, so this one should be a cake walk. But unfortunately, Mattie doesn't have daddy dearest by her side nor the elements of reality.After getting several messages from Josh on her computer after his death, Mattie decides to do a little detective work. She tracks his computer down to a Dexter McCarthy, and finds what is on his hard drive truly disturbing. ""Do You Wanna See A Ghost,"" the computer asks, as it later turns out that Josh has let these creatures loose from the computer and is now accessible through any electronic device. Mattie is not going up against any rapists or has been movie stars in this one, she is going up against the dead.So what are these creatures motives? The chance to be given life again and that's what they take from our batch of characters, including a lifeless performance by pop sensation Christina Millian. Bell's character is strong, with a backbone and a sense that reality can be bent and there is something supernatural that can't be explained. After all, how else can these suicides be constantly occuring and teachers walking in front of buses. Not to mention that the student population is dramatically on the decline and Mattie is the only one who seems to notice.""It's coming for us. It's the end of the world,"" says the man at the local diner. Followed by a few jolts from our pale friends and the creepiness of hearing them through the walls, the film really can't make the audience jump like viewers would want, but it is complicated to make that happen these days. After all, everything now is ""been there, done that"" territory.As for the script, it does not offer much with character background except for Mattie and Josh and pales in comparison to other characters. However, it does shed some light on the Kairo adaptation to explain the odd shadows on the walls and how the creatures are stealing the lives of others.For 90 minutes, the movie does offer some entertainment. Minor chills, minor suspense, but huge on the computer animation makes this movie a decent film to watch for the fun of it. So unless you got a date with someone on the internet or a better movie to watch, grab some red tape and journey on what is to believed the unknown.But you may tend to ask yourself the same question Mattie did to Dexter when first looking at Josh's computer; ""Why are we watching this again?""

After the monetary success of the Ring re-makes dubious as they were Hollywood just had to let their greed show and come out with a load of atrocious re-makes like The Grudge, Shutter, and One missed call, and this movie joins the list of idiotic re-makes.  The story itself promised to be entertaining about seemingly spirits coming though a unknown frequency that was discovered and than spreading through the living world through that frequency until the whole world was infected.

The most annoying thing about the movie was the actors except for about maybe four actors the rest were just so pathetic in their acting skills, it seemed that they were just reading the script lines with little or no emotional feelings.

Ghosts are using the internet to enter into our world, because they operate on a frequency that we've now been able to tune in to.  I like that...it's a clean, simple concept that could have gone in a million directions.  In PULSE, at least initially, it appears that the dead are someone able to infect those who encounter them online...essentially turning the living into death-craving half-zombies.  Basically, they compel their occupants to commit suicide.This all gets kicked off when the boyfriend of college student Kristen Bell commits suicide, more or less in front of her.  Then various friends of hers do stupid things to get themselves killed as well, even though they figure out basically what is going on fairly early on.This is one of those films where the low-budget has led the director into creating a world that isn't entirely recognizable.  The main characters are all college students (I think)...but they never go to class and none of them live in apartments or dorms.  They seem to prefer seedy loft-like spaces that have peeling paint, no lighting, moisture on the walls, etc.  There are virtually no adults in the film at all...only poor Ron Rifkin, who must have lost a bet and was forced to play the world's most ineffectual psychiatrist.  I presume he filmed his scenes with Bell in one day...and not a single moment of their time together adds anything to the film.PULSE starts out as a horror story, but by the end, you realize it has morphed into a science fiction film...an apocalyptic one at that.  The concluding minutes of the film are so far removed in tone, scope and genre from the opening minutes that it is kind of flabbergasting how jarring it is.In the early going, the film generates a few chilling moments.  Just the images of ghosts captured on the computer monitors are creepy, and the early scenes carry a sense of foreboding.  But these same mildly successful elements are almost literally repeated time and time again, to vastly diminishing returns each time.  The movie becomes tedious pretty quickly.No one gives a particularly effective performance, mostly because the characters are almost utterly generic.  Bell gains no points with me for her efforts.  Ian Somerhalder (who was Boone on LOST) plays a computer geek, of sorts, who seems to become something akin to a love interested for Bell...but for no discernible reason.  He is also quite unbelievable in his role.  Samm Levine, a star of FREAKS AND GEEKS, turns up here, and that put a smile on my face until I realized this character was a complete cipher.This film, perhaps, rises to the level of the low-budget films that make up the AFTER DARK HORRORFEST DVDs...horror films that couldn't muster up a theatrical release.  It feels cheap.  It feels self-important.  And worst of all, it is boring.  It certainly does NOT get the PULSE racing (sorry to end with a bad pun, but it's no worse than the ending of this film.)",2,Despite a promising premise...will NOT get your pulse racing.

1018325,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000I0RNYI,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 6]","Pulse (Jim Sonzero, 2006)Okay, the good news: Pulse was a whole lot better than I expected it to be, given that it's an adaptation of a Japanese horror film, is directed by an unknown, is scripted by the long-past-his-prime Wes Craven, is cast with the usual young-and-beautiful TV actors, and bears little resemblance to the original film. (I attribute this betterness to the complete absence of Roy Lee.)The bad news: it's certainly not the film it could have been.But this is beside the point. The real point of this review is to ask a question that has, previously, been a hypothetical one for film snobs like me: why don't we get good remakes of Japanese horror films in America? Because, folks, this question is no longer hypothetical (and I can no longer attempt to answer it with ""Roy Lee""). I can tell you exactly why it is.What is it that makes Pulse stand head and shoulders over your basic Japanese horror film remake? One thing: where Japanese horror films do a lot of leaving of gaps and making the viewer work for it (and Kairo, Kiyoshi Kurosawa's original film, is notorious for this), American horror films, and especially those that are remakes of Japanese horror films, fill in those gaps. The viewer isn't supposed to work at all when watching a Hollywood horror film. Now, Pulse does fill in some of the gaps in the usual Hollywood way, but it leaves a number of them. And guess what it is that American reviewers, critics, pundits, and armchair quarterbacks are complaining about? You got it-- the fact that the viewer has to work is being lambasted, and the movie is being called ""disorganized"" and ""incoherent."" So why won't you get good remakes of Japanese horror films in America? Because the American public doesn't want them. They were destined to think this movie sucks.And it doesn't, really. Sure, it's not Kairo. And there are some silly missteps, and a couple of scenes that appear for the sole purpose of throwing in special effects (the ""elevator scene"" from the trailer, with the two little ghost kids, is a prime example), but overall it works. It's certainly miles better than the recent horrors that were the remakes of Dark Water, The Hills Have Eyes (see? We can't even remake American movies right!), The Grudge, The Ring Two, etc. etc.Mattie Webber (Veronica Mars vixen Kristen Bell) is a university student in Columbus, Ohio. [feel free to insert jokes about Columbus liberally throughout the rest of this review.] Her boyfriend Josh (Jonathan Tucker, recently of Hostage and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake) has been out of contact for a week, so she heads over to his apartment to see what he's up to. While she's there, he commits suicide. Mattie and the rest of her friends-- roommate Isabell (Torque's Christina Millian), Stone (Roll Bounce's Rick Gonzalez), and Tim (Samm Levine, whose small role in Broken Lizard's Club Dread is unforgettable) try to figure out why Josh killed himself-- and why his suicide seems to have sparked a rash of others, along with an even bigger wave of simple disappearances. Eventually, Dexter (Lost's Ian Somerhalder), who bought Josh's old computer from his landlady, also gets roped into things. (I can't really stick it in a quick plot summary, but I feel compelled to point out that there's a quick, and absolutely wonderful, Brad Dourif cameo here that almost made me stand up and cheer.) There's an abundance of red duct tape, as well.As I said before-- you're going to have to work for this. If you go to the theater expecting to turn your brain off and watch mindless action, Pulse is not the film for you. Sonzero is not going to hand you everything on a plate, spelled out in Alpha-Bits. You will have some dots to connect. (It probably helps to have seen the original, as well.) But with some thinking, it's pretty easy to grasp. The real star of the show here, though, is the subtlety with which things are shown as Sonzero builds up to his big, but quite understated, revelations. ""Subtle"" is not a word one is often able to use with Hollywood productions. This could be another reason the film is charged with incoherence; people weren't paying attention. Man, wouldn't that be a surprise?The movie's biggest flaw, especially in comparison with its predecessor, is the ending-- specifically, Kristen Bell's ""let's spell out the big underlying theme"" voiceover, which is utterly unnecessary, not to mention surprising in a film that had delivered it so well up until then. Points off for stupidity on Craven's part.But the best thing about this movie, perhaps, has nothing to do with the movie itself-- it was coming out of the theatre and watching everyone immediately reach for their cell phones. I just sat and watched them and chuckled to myself. ***",3,Not nearly as mind-numbingly stupid as most JNH remakes.,1156377600,"08 24, 2006",2006,4752,"['Pulse', 'Jim', 'Sonzero', '2006', 'Okay', 'good', 'news', 'Pulse', 'was', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'expected', 'be', 'given', 'adaptation', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'film', 'directed', 'unknown', 'scripted', 'long-past-his-prime', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'cast', 'usual', 'young-and-beautiful', 'TV', 'actors', 'little', 'resemblance', 'original', 'film', 'attribute', 'betterness', 'complete', 'absence', 'Roy', 'Lee', 'bad', 'news', 'certainly', 'not', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been.But', 'beside', 'point', 'real', 'point', 'review', 'ask', 'question', 'previously', 'been', 'hypothetical', 'one', 'film', 'snobs', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'good', 'remakes', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'films', 'America', 'folks', 'question', 'longer', 'hypothetical', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'attempt', 'answer', 'Roy', 'Lee', 'can', 'tell', 'exactly', 'why', 'is.What', 'Pulse', 'stand', 'head', 'shoulders', 'basic', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'film', 'remake', 'One', 'thing', 'where', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'films', 'do', 'lot', 'leaving', 'gaps', 'making', 'viewer', 'work', 'Kairo', 'Kiyoshi', 'Kurosawa', 'original', 'film', 'notorious', 'American', 'horror', 'films', 'especially', 'are', 'remakes', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'films', 'fill', 'gaps', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'work', 'when', 'watching', 'Hollywood', 'horror', 'film', 'Now', 'Pulse', 'fill', 'gaps', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'way', 'number', 'guess', 'what', 'American', 'reviewers', 'critics', 'pundits', 'armchair', 'quarterbacks', 'are', 'complaining', 'got', 'fact', 'viewer', 'work', 'being', 'lambasted', 'movie', 'being', 'called', 'disorganized', 'incoherent', 'So', 'why', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'good', 'remakes', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'films', 'America', 'American', 'public', ""n't"", 'want', 'were', 'destined', 'think', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'Sure', 'not', 'Kairo', 'are', 'silly', 'missteps', 'couple', 'scenes', 'appear', 'sole', 'purpose', 'throwing', 'special', 'effects', 'elevator', 'scene', 'trailer', 'two', 'little', 'ghost', 'kids', 'prime', 'example', 'overall', 'certainly', 'miles', 'better', 'recent', 'horrors', 'were', 'remakes', 'Dark', 'Water', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'see', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'remake', 'American', 'movies', 'right', 'Grudge', 'Ring', 'Two', 'etc', 'etc.Mattie', 'Webber', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'vixen', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'university', 'student', 'Columbus', 'Ohio', '[', 'feel', 'free', 'insert', 'jokes', 'Columbus', 'liberally', 'rest', 'review', ']', 'boyfriend', 'Josh', 'Jonathan', 'Tucker', 'recently', 'Hostage', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'remake', 'been', 'contact', 'week', 'apartment', 'see', 'what', 'up', 'there', 'suicide', 'Mattie', 'rest', 'friends', 'roommate', 'Isabell', 'Torque', 'Christina', 'Millian', 'Stone', 'Roll', 'Bounce', 'Rick', 'Gonzalez', 'Tim', 'Samm', 'Levine', 'small', 'role', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'Club', 'Dread', 'unforgettable', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'Josh', 'killed', 'why', 'suicide', 'have', 'sparked', 'rash', 'others', 'even', 'bigger', 'wave', 'simple', 'disappearances', 'Eventually', 'Dexter', 'Lost', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'who', 'bought', 'Josh', 'old', 'computer', 'landlady', 'also', 'roped', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'stick', 'quick', 'plot', 'summary', 'feel', 'compelled', 'point', 'out', 'quick', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'cameo', 'here', 'almost', 'made', 'stand', 'up', 'cheer', 'abundance', 'red', 'duct', 'tape', 'well.As', 'said', 'before', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'work', 'go', 'theater', 'expecting', 'turn', 'brain', 'watch', 'mindless', 'action', 'Pulse', 'not', 'film', 'Sonzero', 'not', 'going', 'hand', 'everything', 'plate', 'spelled', 'out', 'Alpha-Bits', 'will', 'have', 'dots', 'connect', 'probably', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'as', 'well', 'thinking', 'pretty', 'easy', 'grasp', 'real', 'star', 'show', 'here', 'subtlety', 'things', 'are', 'shown', 'Sonzero', 'up', 'big', 'quite', 'understated', 'revelations', 'Subtle', 'not', 'word', 'one', 'often', 'able', 'use', 'Hollywood', 'productions', 'could', 'be', 'reason', 'film', 'charged', 'incoherence', 'people', 'were', ""n't"", 'paying', 'attention', 'Man', 'would', ""n't"", 'that', 'be', 'surprise', 'movie', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'especially', 'comparison', 'predecessor', 'ending', 'specifically', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'let', 'spell', 'out', 'big', 'underlying', 'theme', 'voiceover', 'utterly', 'unnecessary', 'not', 'mention', 'surprising', 'film', 'had', 'delivered', 'so', 'well', 'then', 'Points', 'stupidity', 'Craven', 'part.But', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'theatre', 'watching', 'everyone', 'immediately', 'reach', 'cell', 'phones', 'just', 'sat', 'watched', 'chuckled', 'myself', '***']",N/A

I usually just rent them out now for comedy- which is exactly what this film did for me. Yes the beginning was a bit on the creepy side sure, but after 40 minutes it just grows boring to the point where I started losing interest. So maybe because of that I missed a few things but it's obvious now by some of the other reviews here that it wasn't only I left confused at the end as I tried to place the entire film together. Overall this film does will not, I think, satisfy long time horror fans, but just gives the same old formula of many new horror films coming out with a plot that doesn't keep you too long. It is creepy in some spots sure, but nothing that will keep you up at night or even an hour after the film.So yeah basically average actors are trying too hard to be scared play out a rather odd plot that doesn't fully make sense even towards the end. Matter of fact it just gets more confusing then. The ending is odd to say the least and yet by then I could have cared less. Nothing keeps you in your seat in this film except the curiosity of what is really going on and an interesting explanation on even how it is possible.

So I was kind of looking forward to this movie.  But the Japanese original was subtle and unorthodox in plot by American standards.  There's not really a story as such, as much as a slow unfolding of a mood of dread, punctuated by gradually escalating shocks.  In this American redo the special effects run riot.  The Japanese version whispered its terrors; this movie hammers you over the head LIKE SOMEONE WHO TYPES IN ALL CAPITALS. The big case-in-point and the one that aggravated me the most was the famous shot near the end of the Japanese film, that confirms that the world is coming to an end.  It's a brilliant coup that is absolutely breathtaking.  The same shot shows up in this remake, but it's so surrounded by other tacky FX that its impact is completely lost.  And it's not even half as convincing or real-looking as the Japanese scene anyway, which is ironic because that probably cost a fraction of this one.

The deleted scenes are, once again, ones that should not have been. The making of, and the Special FX elements are very good. Also, with two commentaries, forget about the directors, and focus on the second one with Joel Soisson and others... not only is the second one more informative, but its damned entertaining.Another first rate Romanian shoot, just goes to show that low cost does not mean low value, just that MPAA approved means the story is eviscerated.This is pretty cool in many ways: one of the subordinate characters is now in THE REAPER on one of the Broadcast networks, as they busily and somewhat sardonically collect souls for return to Hell on behalf of the Devil ( Shades of ""Constantine"" and GHOST RIDER , I think ?

1018334,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000I0RNYI,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[21, 23]","One thirdThe Ring+ two thirdsWhite Noise+ a dash ofThe Terminator= a surprisingly disappointing entry into the current Asian influenced horror flicks.The plot is simple.  It opens with a college student that appears to be following a lead on something happening on campus that few are aware of and what happens to him leads to an epidemic of suicides as his girlfriend attempts to unravel the mystery behind his death and those of her friends that follow.  There is a lot of psycho-babble drivel thrown around but no one really seems upset about things like we might be in real life.  This is a direct result of tepid acting, shallow writing, and pedestrian direction.The characters in this story are a group of rather unremarkable and stereotypical college students who are all rather forgettable soon after the film is over and that means that this film never really takes off as we never care much for any of them.  This is what I meant in my headline that this film actually lacks a pulse.  All the males are your typical long, uncombed hair, five o'clock shadow, 20 somethings with little to no personalities.  I can barely tell one from the other.  The same is true for the women who, although pretty, are shallow personality-wise.  This causes the film to lack serious suspense which is created when we care about the characters such as we did with those in ""The Ring"" and ""White Noise"".Speaking of those two outstanding films, this film attempts to mimic elements in them in regards to appearance with its sharp contrasts and washed out colors and the idea that ghosts need conduits to reach us and they don't always play nicely when they do.  Both films also relied upon jolting images that suddenly appear (which has become rather old at this point, much like the overuse of CGI effects)  In addition, this film attempts to tack on the message that we are too dependent on technology which is reminiscent of themes found in ""The Terminator"" films.  Ironically, the film even has an effectively haunting scene in which we see ghosts all over cities and that reminds one ofNight of the Living Deadand28 Days Later.So, with all this negativity, why did I still give this film 3 stars, which means it's good and why did I add it to my shopping cart?  Well, I like the influence of the Asian horror films in that I like the ""look"" of them, the creepiness, the jolting, disturbing images, and such even when the whole film isn't that great.  In addition, while this film certainly isn't original, I do like the components that are copied from better films.  It is still a fun, creepy ride even though we've been on this roller coaster many times before.  Lastly, at PG-13 or even the ""Unrated"" edition this film is one I can watch with my kids (11 and 15).  There are no ""sex scenes"" or anything vividly violent as in a typical ""slasher"" type film.  It's just a creepy film that has some good repeat value.Do I ""recommend"" this film.  No, not really and especially not to those who have tired of this genre already, but those who like this kind of film no matter how redundant or ill-produced, will get a decent kick out of it.BTW:  In regards to Star Ratings, I've read many discussion comments lately that note that 3 stars is poor on Amazon.  I'm not sure where that is coming from as I understand the rating system to be something like this:* = Poor** = Fair*** = Good**** = Excellent***** = OutstandingJust my thoughts on this and I'm sure opinions and interpretations may vary.

1018338,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000I0RNYI,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","""Pulse"" is neither thrilling nor scary. I'm sorry to say this, but that's my impression. Some of the film's gloomy images of the deserted buildings and their interiors are effectively shot, but the story about some otherworldly existence coming through the internet to the physical world needs more refreshing approach than dark-lit library, strange images reflected in the mirror, or young men and women screaming and running around.Kristen Bell is Mattie, whose boyfriend, she finds, is terribly depressed. She later discovers the true reason of his trouble in the strange images stored in his PC. The story looks like a rip-off of ""The Ring"" (or ""The Ringu"" if you like), but the difference is that the spooky entity behind the small screen is far more powerful than a ghost-like little girl coming out of a well.As you know this is a remake of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's ""Kairo"" (aka ""Pulse"") made in 2001. He is often associated with such Japanese directors as Hideo Nakata and Takashi Shimizu, but Kurosawa is the most European in his filmmaking. He opts for slower narrative and less explanation that is fascinating to some viewers, frustrating to others. Whatever your reaction may be, this measured pace and ambiguity is his strength, so retelling Kurosawa's tale literally does not make much sense because in his case tension comes not from the logics, but from the atmosphere. His is like a zombie film without zombies, but surely Hollywood studio thought differently, inserting CG-created images here and there.Where Kurosawa's ""Kairo"" successfully builds up the tension by not telling much about what is really going on, ""Pulse"" (or its characters) talks too much, trying unnecessarily hard to explain the logics of the ""invasion."" I am talking about the theories of red duct tapes, black ashes on the wall, and the means of infection. The more the characters talk about them, the sillier the film becomes and in fact that is exactly what happens in the final 15 minutes.It is not just the reported studio tinkering and the clich&eacute;d narrative that considerably damaged the remade film. It is that you just cannot remake some kind of film and ""Kairo"" is one of them.",2,Yet Another J-Horror Remake,1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,2176,"['Pulse', 'thrilling', 'scary', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'impression', 'film', 'gloomy', 'images', 'deserted', 'buildings', 'interiors', 'are', 'effectively', 'shot', 'story', 'otherworldly', 'existence', 'coming', 'internet', 'physical', 'world', 'more', 'refreshing', 'approach', 'dark-lit', 'library', 'strange', 'images', 'reflected', 'mirror', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'screaming', 'running', 'around.Kristen', 'Bell', 'Mattie', 'boyfriend', 'terribly', 'depressed', 'later', 'true', 'reason', 'trouble', 'strange', 'images', 'stored', 'PC', 'story', 'rip-off', 'Ring', 'Ringu', 'like', 'difference', 'spooky', 'entity', 'small', 'screen', 'far', 'more', 'powerful', 'ghost-like', 'little', 'girl', 'coming', 'well.As', 'know', 'remake', 'Kiyoshi', 'Kurosawa', 'Kairo', 'Pulse', 'made', '2001', 'often', 'associated', 'such', 'Japanese', 'directors', 'Hideo', 'Nakata', 'Takashi', 'Shimizu', 'Kurosawa', 'most', 'European', 'filmmaking', 'slower', 'narrative', 'less', 'explanation', 'fascinating', 'viewers', 'frustrating', 'others', 'reaction', 'may', 'be', 'measured', 'pace', 'ambiguity', 'strength', 'retelling', 'Kurosawa', 'tale', 'literally', 'not', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'case', 'tension', 'not', 'logics', 'atmosphere', 'zombie', 'film', 'zombies', 'surely', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'thought', 'differently', 'inserting', 'CG-created', 'images', 'here', 'there.Where', 'Kurosawa', 'Kairo', 'successfully', 'up', 'tension', 'not', 'telling', 'much', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'Pulse', 'characters', 'talks', 'too', 'much', 'trying', 'unnecessarily', 'hard', 'explain', 'logics', 'invasion', 'am', 'talking', 'theories', 'red', 'duct', 'tapes', 'black', 'ashes', 'wall', 'means', 'infection', 'more', 'characters', 'talk', 'sillier', 'film', 'becomes', 'fact', 'exactly', 'what', 'final', '15', 'minutes.It', 'not', 'just', 'reported', 'studio', 'tinkering', 'clich', 'eacute', 'narrative', 'considerably', 'damaged', 'remade', 'film', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'remake', 'kind', 'film', 'Kairo', 'one']",N/A

1018340,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000I0RNYI,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[3, 6]","Wow. I don't really know where to begin in berating this movie. Let's start with the plot. Oh wait, what plot? Somehow a hacker releases spirits from a server and allows them into the real world. They want to attack people and 'steal their will to live.' Seriously. Their WILL TO LIVE. Not their soul or their life or even their skin a la Hellraiser... no, just their will to live. Once the will to live is taken, the people become depressed and kill themselves... oh wait, not always, sometimes they just turn into a pile of ash. Anyway, they're coming through our internet cables, our cell phone signals, and even wifi... but red tape keeps them from walking through your door. I still don't know if your wifi signal calls them to walk over to where you are or if they actually come through the systems... that's not defined at all. Somehow everyone in this city starts getting attacked by the ""will to live goblins""... everyone except our main heroinne and her hunky new friend who bought her dead boyfriend's computer. The will to live goblins know that those two are the main characters, so they leave them alone. Too bad, because the movie could have been a lot shorter if they'd gotten to them quicker.The cinematography is cool: but the style has already been seen (and put to much better use) in The Ring and The Grudge.The acting is pretty poor, but you can't entirely blame the actors when they have to say lines like, ""All the classrooms are half empty... and NO ONE is TALKING about it!"" Righhhhht.The surprise ending that's mentioned on the back of the DVD case is actually a surprise... but not in a good way. It's more like the definition for ""cop out"". It seems like they ran out of time and money and said, ""instead of saying we quit... let's just say that it's a surprise.""There's also NO REASON for this to be an UNRATED version. The violence is hardly graphic, the ""will to live goblins"" are barely scary, there's no sexual connotations, and the ""F"" word is used once... the unrated version is just a gimmick.
