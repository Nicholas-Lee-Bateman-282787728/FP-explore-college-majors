1334635,A1YCV76MUFESR1,B003A1QSJS,Anne-Marie G,"[15, 15]","I didn't have super high expectations for this movie, beyond expecting to enjoy Jang Geun-Seok's performance (I just watched him inYou're Beautifuland completely loved his on screen presence) and a bit of fun fluff. I mostly got what I expected, it is a little bit ofThree Men and a Babywith a dash ofLook Who's Talkingbut in its own K-Drama way.JGS plays a high schooler (who I suspect is probably bored, his parents have spoiled him) who is always getting suspended or in various kinds of trouble.  He comes home one day  to find his parents have 'run away' from home (this premise alone cracks me up).  Being the responsible young adult he is, he calls his friends and tells them to plan for a party. As he is out shopping for said party a baby shows up in his shopping cart with a not informing him that he is the father.This movie easily could have been turned into a series, so instead of in depth building of characters everyone is drawing in a very quick way, as is the plot. Luckily, since this movie is building on our expectations we can fill in the blanks that the time limits the movie from telling us point blank.The female lead is adorable, and for her alone I wish this had been a series and not just a movie. Kim Byeol (playing a character with the same name, hah) is a ridiculously smart girl who wears some of the most hilarious pajamas I have seen.  She quit school because she was too much of an outcast--however upon seeing Han Junsu (Jang Geun-Seok) she decides to go back (seriously, his good looks do it). She is a quirky character who easily puts everyone in their place, but it is also pretty obvious she has a heart of gold.I'd recommend this movie if you are looking for some mostly mindless fluff.  The baby is adorable (and I think having him have voice over dialogue is pretty unnecessary as he is a very, very expressive infant and what he is thinking gets across pretty well in other ways).  JGS is as fun to watch as he was in You're Beautiful (well, almost as fun, he doesn't sing in this and he lacks the dramatic guyliner).",4,Pretty Cute Mindless Fluff,1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,2061,"['did', ""n't"", 'have', 'super', 'high', 'expectations', 'movie', 'expecting', 'enjoy', 'Jang', 'Geun-Seok', 'performance', 'just', 'watched', 'inYou', ""'re"", 'Beautifuland', 'completely', 'loved', 'screen', 'presence', 'bit', 'fun', 'fluff', 'mostly', 'got', 'what', 'expected', 'little', 'bit', 'ofThree', 'Men', 'Babywith', 'dash', 'ofLook', 'Who', 'Talkingbut', 'own', 'K-Drama', 'way.JGS', 'high', 'schooler', 'who', 'suspect', 'probably', 'bored', 'parents', 'have', 'spoiled', 'who', 'always', 'getting', 'suspended', 'various', 'kinds', 'trouble', 'home', 'one', 'day', 'find', 'parents', 'have', ""'run"", 'away', 'home', 'premise', 'alone', 'up', 'Being', 'responsible', 'young', 'adult', 'friends', 'plan', 'party', 'out', 'shopping', 'said', 'party', 'baby', 'up', 'shopping', 'cart', 'not', 'informing', 'father.This', 'movie', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'series', 'instead', 'depth', 'building', 'characters', 'everyone', 'drawing', 'very', 'quick', 'way', 'plot', 'Luckily', 'movie', 'building', 'expectations', 'can', 'fill', 'blanks', 'time', 'movie', 'telling', 'point', 'blank.The', 'female', 'lead', 'adorable', 'alone', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'series', 'not', 'just', 'movie', 'Kim', 'Byeol', 'playing', 'character', 'same', 'name', 'hah', 'ridiculously', 'smart', 'girl', 'who', 'most', 'hilarious', 'pajamas', 'have', 'seen', 'quit', 'school', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'outcast', 'however', 'seeing', 'Han', 'Junsu', 'Jang', 'Geun-Seok', 'go', 'back', 'seriously', 'good', 'looks', 'do', 'quirky', 'character', 'who', 'easily', 'everyone', 'place', 'also', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'heart', 'gold.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'are', 'looking', 'mostly', 'mindless', 'fluff', 'baby', 'adorable', 'think', 'having', 'have', 'voice', 'dialogue', 'pretty', 'unnecessary', 'very', 'very', 'expressive', 'infant', 'what', 'thinking', 'pretty', 'well', 'other', 'ways', 'JGS', 'as', 'fun', 'watch', 'was', ""'re"", 'Beautiful', 'well', 'almost', 'fun', ""n't"", 'sing', 'dramatic', 'guyliner']",Baby and Me Korean Movie Dvd with English Sub
