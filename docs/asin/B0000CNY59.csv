Chronicling the exploits of the famed London Train Robbery in the 1960s and focusing on lifetime thief &#34;Buster&#34; Edwards (Collins), the film jumps back and forth from comedy and drama with out much consistency.

Especially after it turned into a pretty nifty film.  The soundtrack was cool, the story was based on a real life robbery (there's actually a film that plays the same robbery as gritty heist film, so that would be interesting to see as far as cinematic styles go), and everyone was very good in it.  The Sixties feel looked authentic--are there parts of London that will be forever locked in the 1960s?But I also knew that Phil had a bumpy ride in Hollywood.When his awesome song, ""Against All Odds,"" was up for an Academy Award, Phil planned his entire tour around making himself available for the Oscars that spring...only to be told by the Academy that only ""movie people"" would be doing the songs.  Like Stevie Wonder.Apparently, Little Stevie hopping around in the BEACH PARTY movies in the 60's qualified him as a ""movie person"" and he was allowed to sing his monotonous ""I Just Called To Say I Love You"" from THE WOMAN IN RED.  Phil got to watch Ann Reinking butcher his song in an overblown production number while squirming in his seat.  (The letter telling him he wasn't needed was even addressed to ""Phil Cooper,"" to add insult to injury).""I Just Called to Say I Love You"" ended up winning, and Stevie then said he didn't write the song for the film (effectively disqualifying it for the Oscars), he wrote it for Nelson Mandela.When Phil told Rolling Stone, ""He's blind, he's black, he lives in L.A.  Of course, he was going to win,"" you would've thought Phil flew down to South Africa and did a MIDNIGHT EXPRESS-styled beating on Mandela.So I kind of wondered if Hollywood was posioning BUSTER's reception in the States.I liked it.  While so many movies allow audiences to fantasize about how they can make a big score through robbery and then be rich, BUSTER pops that balloon by showing that, even when the robbery is a success, the aftermath is still wrought with uncertainty and danger.So all's well that ends well, I guess.  Phil's won an Oscar for the Tarzan song.  He may have won another one, for all I know.  I just saw him on tour last year and he still has a funny sense of humor I first saw back in 1985.And BUSTER is on DVD.
