I am the exact target audience for this DVD release and if you're reading this, then you probably are as well. So I will appeal to my fellow collector.I loved this show as a kid and it really shows its age. It does not hold up very well and I have to laugh that all the ""problems"" seem to occur around small towns or places up in the mountains...cheap to shoot, I'm sure.The good is...IT'S SHAZAM! And that by itself makes this work having. But I have to say this. When they released ISIS, it had a nice documentary on it (though it surprising lacked interviews with it's lead star), so I thought for sure, this is Shazam! It must have some excellent bonus features on it. Well, my friends, it has SQUAT!! And don't count the ""morals"" as a bonus feature, especially since some look as if they were taken from someone's home VHS collection, which I think they were. Besides, they aired as part of the show, so, sorry, that's not a bonus feature. Not one documentary or audio commentary...NOTHING! But ISIS has them??? Come on! Seriously, we waited this long and get nothing but the episodes. Since they do feel dated, some sort of effort in the bonus feature category might have made me actually give this 5 stars. I even met the original Shazam, Jackson Bostwick, at a convention and he explained why he seemed to suddenly be replaced by John Davey. There's a good story to be told, and quite frankly, this release is only going to appeal to me and you. Kids today are used to a completely differently level of quality, and this isn't it.So shame on you WB for putting absolutely no effort into make this a true fan collectable. I have muddled thru a few episodes for fun. Ha, Danny Bonaduce from The Partridge Family even appears in an episode.So to sum up, I'm very happy Shazam is finally on DVD, and the picture and sound quality are good, and I do love the Jerry Ordway DVD cover. I would only recommend this to a friend if that friend were a collector like you and I, but with no bonus features, it is a hollow victory. Next time, WB, know your audience!!",3,Holy Moly!

After watching it, the effects are still plenty dated (obviously), but there is considerably more substance and charm than what I remember. And I was watching it during it's first run. For Saturday morning television, clearly this was tops in the field. My faded memory may be the result of my last thoughts on the show after watching the stand in (John Davey) play Shazam instead of Jackson Bostwick, who is the DEFINITIVE Shazam. The show suffers without him. Thankfully out of the entire run of the series, Davey only filled in for the last eleven episodes. Bostwick however was superb as Shazam and Michael Gray was excellent as Billy Batson. Les Tremayne played Billy's partner in crime ""Mentor"" like everyone's favorite uncle. But every show did a fine job of telling an important lesson about accountability that is every bit as valid today as it was back then. While simple in construct, the execution and care given to these characters is obvious. It truly is a crime that no show on Saturday mornings today reflect these kinds of lessons. Our country needs it badly. If you grew up with this show, BUY IT NOW! From what I here, it will not remain in production (sadly). But if ever you needed an old classic in your collection, this is it. Relevant in it's day and even more so today.",5,Even better than I remember!

I was kind of shocked at the poor quality of the transfer, an excessively grainy image compared to other shows from this time period that are available on DVD (SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN, KUNG FU), but let's face it, the show's 40 years old, it was just a kid's show, and nobody thought it was important enough to preserve the original elements at the time. I guess we're lucky they preserved the original bumpers (""We'll return to SHAZAM! after these messages..."", ""...And now, back to SHAZAM!""). But frankly I'd have been happier to pay less than $10 for a single-disc incomplete sampling of episodes likeSecrets of Isis.But the honest to gosh truth is, it wasn't a great show to begin with. Cheap to a fault and shot entirely on exterior locations, hobbled by child psychologists and their pro-social ""morals"" and plot limitations on action and violence. Special FX that are one step above what you yourself could do at home. Every episode followed the same formula: after a cryptic warning from the Elders about the situation to come, the bulk of the episode has Billy meet with a kid or kids with a problem, and at the end of the episode Billy changes to Captain Marvel for the final few minutes to resolve the problem. A fair number of episode climaxes featured a frantic attempt to escape by someone in a car.But is IS Shazam. Jackson Bostwick looked good in the costume, and the suit is as accurate to the original comics as they could make it (not a big concern in movies nowadays, for all of the other progress they've made). The six Elders, for all the minimal animation (lips and eyes) they were given, are very nicely designed and always a welcome interruption, for as little screen time as they had per episode.  As kids, we were starved for some kind of live action superheroes at the time. These were the dark days for fans of the comic books on television, and until Wonder Woman came along a couple of years later, we had to make do with Shazam, Isis, and ElectraWoman & DynaGirl (which for all of its corniness, was probably the superior show - at least they fought supervillains).I'm hoping at some point that Warner Archives will release the 12 episodes of the 1981 Shazam! cartoon series (part of the ""Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam!"", the other part of which,Hero High - The Complete Series, has already been released on DVD). I suspect it was not only better preserved, but holds up better after 30 years. It was much closer to the comic books, featuring the entire Marvel Family and the classic villains like Dr. Sivana, Black Adam and Mr. Mind.",3,It is what it is.,1363132800,"03 13, 2013",2013,2663,"['long', 'short', 'five', 'stars', 'nostalgia', 'one', 'star', 'adult', 'thinking', 'brain', 'was', 'kind', 'shocked', 'poor', 'quality', 'transfer', 'excessively', 'grainy', 'image', 'compared', 'other', 'shows', 'time', 'period', 'are', 'available', 'DVD', 'SIX', 'MILLION', 'DOLLAR', 'MAN', 'KUNG', 'FU', 'let', 'face', 'show', '40', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'just', 'kid', 'show', 'nobody', 'thought', 'was', 'important', 'enough', 'preserve', 'original', 'elements', 'time', 'guess', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'preserved', 'original', 'bumpers', ""'ll"", 'return', 'SHAZAM', 'messages', 'now', 'back', 'SHAZAM', 'frankly', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'happier', 'pay', 'less', '10', 'single-disc', 'incomplete', 'sampling', 'episodes', 'likeSecrets', 'Isis.But', 'honest', 'gosh', 'truth', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'show', 'begin', 'Cheap', 'fault', 'shot', 'entirely', 'exterior', 'locations', 'hobbled', 'child', 'psychologists', 'pro-social', 'morals', 'plot', 'limitations', 'action', 'violence', 'Special', 'FX', 'are', 'one', 'step', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'home', 'Every', 'episode', 'followed', 'same', 'formula', 'cryptic', 'warning', 'Elders', 'situation', 'come', 'bulk', 'episode', 'Billy', 'meet', 'kid', 'kids', 'problem', 'end', 'episode', 'Billy', 'Captain', 'Marvel', 'final', 'few', 'minutes', 'resolve', 'problem', 'fair', 'number', 'episode', 'climaxes', 'featured', 'frantic', 'attempt', 'escape', 'someone', 'car.But', 'IS', 'Shazam', 'Jackson', 'Bostwick', 'looked', 'good', 'costume', 'suit', 'as', 'accurate', 'original', 'comics', 'could', 'make', 'not', 'big', 'concern', 'movies', 'nowadays', 'other', 'progress', ""'ve"", 'made', 'six', 'Elders', 'minimal', 'animation', 'lips', 'eyes', 'were', 'given', 'are', 'very', 'nicely', 'designed', 'always', 'welcome', 'interruption', 'as', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'had', 'episode', 'kids', 'were', 'starved', 'kind', 'live', 'action', 'superheroes', 'time', 'were', 'dark', 'days', 'fans', 'comic', 'books', 'television', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'came', 'couple', 'years', 'later', 'had', 'make', 'do', 'Shazam', 'Isis', 'ElectraWoman', 'DynaGirl', 'corniness', 'was', 'probably', 'superior', 'show', 'least', 'fought', 'supervillains', '.I', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'point', 'Warner', 'Archives', 'will', 'release', '12', 'episodes', '1981', 'Shazam', 'cartoon', 'series', 'part', 'Kid', 'Super', 'Power', 'Hour', 'Shazam', 'other', 'part', 'Hero', 'High', 'Complete', 'Series', 'already', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'suspect', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'better', 'preserved', 'up', 'better', '30', 'years', 'was', 'much', 'closer', 'comic', 'books', 'featuring', 'entire', 'Marvel', 'Family', 'classic', 'villains', 'Dr.', 'Sivana', 'Black', 'Adam', 'Mr', 'Mind']",N/A

I read somewhere that the morals at the conclusion of each episode had been cut out of both Shazam and Isis a while back from whoever had rights to the show at that time. It is a horrible shame that the morals were destroyed. The content of those morals were wonderful teaching tools and life lessons to learn and live by. They made quite an impression on me when I was a child of 9 years old then. Being 47 years old now and a foster parent, I buy  shows like Shazam/Isis/Land Of The Lost and many more to my young kids who love them as much as I did when I was a kid. Funny how these made for Saturday Morning shows are remembered so fondly. I must confess, I am still waiting for the official DVD release of all 20 episodes of Bigfoot and Wildboy. The shows are still as fun and as exciting today as they were so many years ago. The production values are clean and of the highest standards. The moral advice is absolutely priceless and still means as much today as it ever did. Oh God how I sometimes wish I could go back to that simpler time when I couldn't wait to watch a great show like Shazam and Isis and Wonder Woman and Bionic Woman and Six Million Dollar Man. Even though I now poses all of these shows now on DVD and countless others from that era, I still dream of what it was like to be a kid during that wonderful time. So let's not nitpick at Warner Brothers for not having extra's, let's just be happy that they have released it at all. People involved with tv shows often do not wish to be interviewed or no longer have the time or are unreachable. I do not believe that it was Warner Brothers that cut out the morals either it was whomever had the show before them. I am just so happy that I can now view the episodes with great picture and sound and at an affordable price.

I was also very disappointed to learn that the final ending morals, a staple of every Filmation project, were sadly very below average quality.  Please do not base your final decision on this because of rare and almost impossible difficult to find copies.  The rest of the episodes is perfect!  I can easily forgive this, which is why I rated this set a 4.  I don't wish to persuade anyone from NOT purchasing this box set, as it is a MUST for every collector and childhood fan.

1598891,A3JL195UPPU8IW,B009M4KT3I,Joel Bowers,"[6, 7]",I haven't seen this show since I was 15 in 1976. So I'm glad to see it's out on dvd. The picture & sound quality are as good now as ever. But this version of Captain Marvel is only partially faithful to the original comic books. There's no origin story except the brief explanation by the narrator at the beginning of each episode. We see the six ''elders''- the Greek gods from which Shazam's name is derived in animated form. But where is Shazam himself? Also the role of Billy Batson is made to appear to be about 20 years old. In the original Whiz Comic books Billy was a young paperboy around 10-11 years old. That doesn't stop this from being an enjoyable show. Micheal Gray handles the role of Billy Batson very well as does Les Tremayne as Mentor.Not much has been heard of from Micheal Gray or Les Tremayne since. Does anyone know what are they doing today? Jackson Bostwick looks great as Captain Marvel.He's clearly the best Captain Marvel onscreen thus far.This is a fine show that teaches us morals and values without being overbearing. John Davey took over the role for reasons unknown after Bostwick made the first 17 episodes. Davey's ok in this  role except his voice shakes a bit when he says Shazam. On some of the episodes the cartoon images of the elders looks a bit foggy. Was this the effect the filmmakers hoped to achieve? Or is this the result of aging after 39 years? Either way I can easily forgive this because the technology we have today didn't exist back in 1974. Nearly all of the episodes focus on teenagers & the troubles they get into. This is a show everyone can still enjoy today.I do wonder though why is this a 3 disc set? It could easily have been reduced to 2 discs because we get no bonus features at all.  By the way do all of you fans know about the Adventures of Captain Marvel serial from 1941? It's available on dvd. You'll find the origin of Captain Marvel altered just as it was on this show. You will see the wizard Shazam-but only once. There are no elders. There's no Mentor either. But Billy/Captain Marvel has a few other friends to lend a hand. Here's a few notes about guest stars on the tv show. The Joyriders episode-Barry Miller plays a teenager. He also did 1 episode of The Secrets Of Isis during this time. Later he was in the movies Saturday Night Fever(1978) playing Bobby C. & Fame(1980) where he played Ralph Garcie a Puerto Rican student at New York City's High School For The Performing Arts. Thou Shalt Not Kill episode-Pamelyn Ferdin plays Lynn Colby. Pamelyn was a very busy child actress. Check out her website Pamelyn Ferdin.com for a full list of her roles.The Brothers episode-Lance Kerwin plays a blind boy. Kerwin was a busy child actor. His last known role was James At 15 a short lived tv series from the late 1970's. The Braggart episode-On the end credits Frank Coghlan is listed as having played a guard at a local zoo. Coghlan played Billy Batson in the Adventures Of Captain Marvel serial.Fool's Gold episode-Dabbs Greer best known for his work on Little House On The Prairie plays a prospector.Speak No Evil episode- Danny Bonaduce from The Partridge Family plays Paul a teenager.The Sound Of A Different Drummer episode-Eric Lanueville plays Curtis an aspiring teenage violinist. Around this same time Eric did a few episodes of Sanford And Son. He played  Aunt Esther and Uncle Woody's adopted teenage son Daniel.I do hope we'll see Shazam on the big screen in the near future. Hope everybody enjoys the show as much as I do- and the extra history lesson too!

In the 2nd year,""SHAZAM!"" was paired up with another Live Action show ""ISIS"",creating the SHAZAM!/ISIS Hour (each show running its own 30 minutetime slot). ""ISIS"" (later re-named ""THE SECRETS OF ISIS"") was aboutan original Female Superhero(ine) who was not originally a comicbook hero, like Captain Marvel was.  ""ISIS"" was the 1st t.v. seriesto have a female superhero who was the featured ""STAR"" of the show.Captain Marvel was an immensely popular comic book superhero backin the 1940's.  In those years, Captain Marvel (at times) outsoldSuperman Comic Books.  In the original Captain Marvel Comic Books,Billy Batson was a 12 year old boy, who, by yelling out the word""SHAZAM"", would be ""struck"" by a lightning bolt, and transformedinto the world's mightiest mortal, ""Captain Marvel"".The t.v. series ""SHAZAM!"" differs somewhat from the original""Captain Marvel"" comic book.  On the t.v. series, Billy Batsonis slightly older, I'd guess about 16 or 17 years old.  He isaccompanied by a mature gentleman, whom Billy calls ""MENTOR"".MENTOR is a sort of Philosophical Teacher who travels withBilly from town to town (in a recreational vehicle), teachingand guiding him with sage advise, helping Billy to understandand to help others  (typically, helping a person out of adifficult situation of his or her own making).  Billy helpsout, both as himself, and as a transformed Captain Marvel.The series (""SHAZAM!"") teaches important morals/values thatwere/are important to kids (of all ages !!).  I believe thisseries is a much needed program for these times, as so manyt.v., movie, and comic book Heroes and SuperHeroes (of the past15 years or so) look and behave menacingly, anti-social, VIOLENT,un-remorseful, etc.  Where are the Bible-Based Morals/Values ??Parents, Get this for your kids !!

This show is what we talked about in grade school the following monday. This kind of TV is unheard of now. Jackson Bostwick looked like someone drew him. His features and build and athletic prowess fit that part. He looked good. The costume liked him. The camera loved him. Do you know why he left the show? He injured his right eye when his stunt box collapsed under him during one of his classic take offs. He hit the pavement hard. Dazed, he got up and realized a piece of that apparatus almost ripped out his right eye. The producers downplayed his injury and even convinced the nurse to change her story on the reports. Jackson rightfully exercised his rights for compensation and moreover exposed the coverup with a super 8 film taken of the accident in slow motion which was shown in court. Jackson got his contract paid out plus residuals so to keep his profit at a minumum, the producers cancelled the show putting everyone else out of a job and thus killing a classic show no one knew at the time. Poor Mr. Davey had to fly without a workout, a haircut, and a shave before he came down in a lightning bolt.
