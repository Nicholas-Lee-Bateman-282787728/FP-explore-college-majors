Greg and his Dad are at odds - Greg wants to play video games all summer, and his Dad wants him to get outdoors. Both think they have little in common, and Greg ends up deceiving his family about a summer job in order to get his Dad off his back. Of course everything comes out in the end, and he learns valuable lessons about honesty, and both he and his Dad learn lessons about acceptance and loyalty.

With the lies mounting, Greg and his father's relationship becomes more strained until they go on a camping trip bonding the two together.There are many great scenes that will  have kids laughing and parents nodding their heads in agreement. What I love most about this movie besides the funny, sweet, comical side is that kids hopefully come from away with a lesson that lying is not the best policy and being honest with our parents will make your relationship much stronger. When Greg's father says he is disappointed in him, Greg feels it much more than if his father had grounded him.

1491653,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B005LAIIT4,Ranny Levy,"[0, 0]","This is Julianna Noone reporting for KIDS FIRST! and reviewing the film Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.  This film is the third film in this popular series and is based on the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books, which are written by Jeff Kinney.  These books are about the ups and downs of growing up and trying to deal with school, family and relationships.  The stories are so well written and relatable, that you can't help but love the books and the movies.  This film stars Zachary Gordon, who does a great job once again as the main character Greg Heffley, and Robert Capron, as his lovable friend Rowley Jefferson.  This films starts out with Greg and Rowley finishing the school year and planning out their summer vacation.  There's only one problem, as usual for Greg, nothing goes as planned.  Follow along as Greg and Rowley try to make it through the dog days of summer.  My favorite character is Greg because he is funny and means well even when he makes mistakes and deep down, he just wants everyone to like him.  It is hard choosing one scene as my favorite, because most of the scenes at the country club are absolutely hysterical, but I was able to choose one.  That's when Greg's older brother Roderick, played brilliantly by Devon Bostick, tries to fake drowning to the pretty life guard will save him.  The problem is, she doesn't even notice him, so an older, hairy man dives into the pool, pulls him out and performs mouth to mouth on him.  Roderick's facial expression was priceless and this scene is just so funny, I could not stop laughing.  Not only is this movie well written and very funny, but it has a really strong cast that help bring to life the Heffley family and make this an enjoyable film that the entire family can relate too and enjoy.  The movie also has a great message in it about growing up and learning from your mistakes.  Overall, I love this fabulous film and urge you to take your family and go see this film today.  I rate this film 5 out of 5 stars, as I think this is a film your entire family will love as much as I do.  Go see this film, opening in theaters on August 3rd, trust me, you will love it!

But Dog Days is so funny that you might fall off the chair and still laugh. Rodrick Rules is funny that you might fall off the bed and still laugh. The first one will make you fall off an couch.

1491678,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B005LAIIT4,Z Hayes,"[2, 2]","My eight-year-old daughter has been devouring the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series of books in the past couple of weeks, and we've been watching the movies together. We enjoyed the first two and managed to get Dog Days, the third in the movie franchise from our public library. I have to admit that even I enjoyed it, just about as much as my daughter did!The third film follows our beloved wimp, Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) throughout his summer vacation. Greg's dad, Frank (Steve Zahn) thinks Greg needs to spend less time playing video games and more times outdoors, which Greg considers a disastrous proposition. Greg tries various evasive tactics before finally settling on the most reliable, accepting his best friend Rowley's (Robert Capron) invitations to the local country club, which is members only. This also provides Greg the golden opportunity of getting closer to popular girl Holly (Peyton List). When Frank announces that Greg can come work at his company as an unpaid intern for the summer, the desperate Greg lies that he has got a job at the country club. Of course, older brother, the pesky Rodrick (Devon Bostick) sniffs out the truth and blackmails Greg, forcing Greg to sneak Rodrick into the country club each time he goes there with Rowley.This third installment provides lots of laughter. Though some of the comical situations might seem contrived, they work, and the funny dialogue as well as the excellent acting by the ensemble cast create lots of comedic moments that had me and my daughter laughing out loud throughout the movie. There's one particular scene involving Greg, a little girl, and a diving board that is just too funny, and many more.The movie also has its poignant moments. Greg and his dad seem to be very different people and just can't seem to find common ground, and the situations in which they are thrown together often result in disaster, but through it all, Frank Heffley bears with his rascal of a son and the resolution is satisfactory to all. This is great family fun and clean too, which is so hard to come by in so-called family entertainment these days. My daughter and I can't wait for the rest of the movies in this series.",5,"Third times a charm, funniest Wimpy Kid yet!",1371686400,"06 20, 2013",2013,2182,"['eight-year-old', 'daughter', 'been', 'devouring', 'Diary', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', 'series', 'books', 'past', 'couple', 'weeks', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'movies', 'together', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'two', 'managed', 'get', 'Dog', 'Days', 'third', 'movie', 'franchise', 'public', 'library', 'have', 'admit', 'even', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'daughter', 'did', 'third', 'film', 'beloved', 'wimp', 'Greg', 'Heffley', 'Zachary', 'Gordon', 'summer', 'vacation', 'Greg', 'dad', 'Frank', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Greg', 'spend', 'less', 'time', 'playing', 'video', 'games', 'more', 'times', 'outdoors', 'Greg', 'disastrous', 'proposition', 'Greg', 'various', 'evasive', 'tactics', 'finally', 'settling', 'most', 'reliable', 'accepting', 'best', 'friend', 'Rowley', 'Robert', 'Capron', 'invitations', 'local', 'country', 'club', 'members', 'only', 'also', 'Greg', 'golden', 'opportunity', 'getting', 'closer', 'popular', 'girl', 'Holly', 'Peyton', 'List', 'When', 'Frank', 'Greg', 'can', 'come', 'work', 'company', 'unpaid', 'intern', 'summer', 'desperate', 'Greg', 'got', 'job', 'country', 'club', 'course', 'older', 'brother', 'pesky', 'Rodrick', 'Devon', 'Bostick', 'out', 'truth', 'blackmails', 'Greg', 'forcing', 'Greg', 'sneak', 'Rodrick', 'country', 'club', 'time', 'there', 'Rowley.This', 'third', 'installment', 'lots', 'laughter', 'comical', 'situations', 'might', 'seem', 'contrived', 'work', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'as', 'well', 'excellent', 'acting', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'create', 'lots', 'comedic', 'moments', 'had', 'daughter', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'movie', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'involving', 'Greg', 'little', 'girl', 'diving', 'board', 'just', 'too', 'funny', 'many', 'more.The', 'movie', 'also', 'poignant', 'moments', 'Greg', 'dad', 'seem', 'be', 'very', 'different', 'people', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'common', 'ground', 'situations', 'are', 'thrown', 'together', 'often', 'result', 'disaster', 'Frank', 'Heffley', 'rascal', 'son', 'resolution', 'satisfactory', 'great', 'family', 'fun', 'clean', 'too', 'so', 'hard', 'come', 'so-called', 'family', 'entertainment', 'days', 'daughter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'rest', 'movies', 'series']",N/A
