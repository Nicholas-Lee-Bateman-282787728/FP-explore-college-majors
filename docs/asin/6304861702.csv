438015,A1IBC9XP2LICQL,6304861702,A. Wolverton,"[47, 48]","If you are a fan of the Carpenters, this DVD will be a welcome addition to your collection.  The disc offers quite a lot of information and footage:  the documentary itself covers the Carpenters from their beginnings as a jazz trio to the A&M; hits to Karen's tragic death at the age of 32.  The disc has lots of extras too:  A portion of the Carpenters performance at the White House, some of their commercials, and a listing of singles and albums in the discography section.  Really a lot to like...Being a documentary, fans should understand that this is NOT a concert film.  Some reviewers are upset that the songs aren't played in their entirety.  Again, it's not a concert DVD.  Buy the CD's.The biggest disappointment for me is the lack of understanding we come away with of Karen (and Richard too, for that matter).  The DVD tells briefly about Karen's wedding, but doesn't even mention who she married!!!  What was it that made Karen such a tragic figure?  What is Richard doing now and how did the end of the Carpenters change his life?  Maybe I'm asking for too much and maybe all this is still too painful for the family to deal with.  I don't think fans are asking for tabloid-type reporting.  I do think a lot of fans sincerely want to know what was going through Karen's mind, what demons she was dealing with and what Richard is dealing with now.  Maybe that's too much for them to present to the general public.  Be glad that the Carptenters gave us some great music and some great memories, many of which are captured on this DVD.",4,"Lots To Like, But Lots Hidden",1011571200,"01 21, 2002",2002,1548,"['are', 'fan', 'Carpenters', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'welcome', 'addition', 'collection', 'disc', 'quite', 'lot', 'information', 'footage', 'documentary', 'Carpenters', 'beginnings', 'jazz', 'trio', 'A', 'M', 'hits', 'Karen', 'tragic', 'death', 'age', '32', 'disc', 'lots', 'extras', 'too', 'portion', 'Carpenters', 'performance', 'White', 'House', 'commercials', 'listing', 'singles', 'albums', 'discography', 'section', 'Really', 'lot', 'like', 'Being', 'documentary', 'fans', 'should', 'understand', 'NOT', 'concert', 'film', 'reviewers', 'are', 'upset', 'songs', 'are', ""n't"", 'played', 'entirety', 'Again', 'not', 'concert', 'DVD', 'Buy', ""CD's.The"", 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'lack', 'understanding', 'come', 'away', 'Karen', 'Richard', 'too', 'matter', 'DVD', 'briefly', 'Karen', 'wedding', ""n't"", 'even', 'mention', 'who', 'married', 'What', 'was', 'made', 'Karen', 'tragic', 'figure', 'What', 'Richard', 'doing', 'now', 'how', 'did', 'end', 'Carpenters', 'change', 'life', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'asking', 'too', 'much', 'maybe', 'still', 'too', 'painful', 'family', 'deal', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fans', 'are', 'asking', 'tabloid-type', 'reporting', 'do', 'think', 'lot', 'fans', 'sincerely', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Karen', 'mind', 'what', 'was', 'dealing', 'what', 'Richard', 'dealing', 'now', 'Maybe', 'too', 'much', 'present', 'general', 'public', 'Be', 'glad', 'Carptenters', 'gave', 'great', 'music', 'great', 'memories', 'many', 'are', 'captured', 'DVD']",Close to You: Remembering the Carpenters

Richard Carpenter is the primary ""host"", although there are many others who contribute stories and information about the Carpenters, such as Petula Clark, Joe Osborne, Les Paul, Herb Alpert, Burt Bacharach, and members of the Carpenter band.The DVD tells the entire story of Richard and Karen, from their childhoods in New Haven, Connecticut, their family move across the country to Downey, California (to further Richard's budding career as a musician), their meteoric rise to the top of the pop music charts, and finally the tragic end with Karen's death from complications from anorexia nervosa. Along the way, there are wonderful clips from many of their major hit songs, how the songs were ""born"", and how Richard's genius at arranging the songs made them hits.  It is all very well done, a quality production in every detail, and it does an excellent, although brief job at introducing the Carpenters career.  I had hoped that there would be more details of the Carpenters personal lives, but this is just barely touched upon or hinted at in the DVD.  Personal details would have so enriched this DVD and helped the fans of the Carpenters understand the duo even better.  The DVD states that for additional information, one is directed to the book by Ray Coleman, ""The Carpenters: The Untold Story : An Authorized Biography"".  I highly recommend this book to any fan that wishes more information about the Carpenters, as it provides additional details about their lives.To anyone who views this DVD, please do not turn off the TV after the post-production credits run!  There is an encore after the credits that you will not want to miss!  I missed it the first time I watched the DVD, as I was partially overcome with grief at the scenes of Karen's funeral.For Carpenter fans, this DVD will be a cherished item in our collections.

Told through various interviews and snippets of some of their greatest songs, one truly gets a feeling for who Karen and Richard Carpenter really were.  The hair and the clothing styles are shockingly laughable (but what were you wearing then?) and the wholesomeness is just too much.  However, the film is quick to point out that these visuals were a product of bad marketing on A&amp;M's account and not on the Carpenters themselves.  Actually Karen was a true hip fun spirit who's first love was the drums with singing coming later - and what a voice it was!Starting with Richard's early 60's bands, the film goes on to explain how Karen got into the picture and turned the group into the biggest selling American group of the period.  Over 100 million records were sold!Sure, there are those progressive scenes where Karen gets thinner and thinner and it can be tough to watch, but the whole idea is to understand that Karen Carpenter was the first celebrity to put a face on anorexia.  It was a terrible lesson and the documentary leaves you wondering what incredible things would have been had she survived it all.Richard Carpenter is shown to be a worthy and talented arranger, but his pomposity can be grating, leaving the viewer wishing for more of Karen, but alas, there are no vocal interviews with her here.A moving film filled with great anecdotes, history and music; you'll enjoy it.

Back in 1982 I worked for the law firm which represented the Carpenters and Karen would come in from time to time. It truely was a thrill just to hold a script of their T.V. special in my hands. She's gone now but she left us with so many great songs and performances. Their great success was due to 3 things:  Karen's GREAT voice, Richard being a brilliant musician, and Richard's ability to know a good song when he heard it. I followed their career from the begining and never in a million years thought I'd work at a firm that would be their attys.
