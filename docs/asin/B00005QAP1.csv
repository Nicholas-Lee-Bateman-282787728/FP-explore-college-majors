The movie (and monster) within in no way resemble it.  The best way to describe The Item is what would happen if Frank Henenlotter (the Basket Case series, as well as Frankenhooker and Brain Damage) teamed up Quentin Tarantino to do a Resevoir Dogs variant, but with a mind messing monster instead of an undercover cop.A quartet of foul mouthed criminals have landed what appears to be a great job.  Pick up a box from a seller and just hold onto it for a little while until the buyers show up to collect it.  Easy, right?  Wrong.  The leader has told everyone that it's a monkey in the box, but that is no monkey.  It is a strange lifeform (alien?) that, when it wakes up, begins to effect the group of criminals in dangerous ways.Writer/director Dan Clark gives the viewer an interesting, and very well developed, cast of characters, stylized violence, and a plot that, while remaining within the genre conventions, still kept me wondering just what the heck was going to happen next.  On the down side, the director's cut I saw suffered from slow pacing, lingering on scenes with a loving detail that strained my patience.  The movie was in need of a serious trimming (which is why I give it three stars instead of four).  But fans of the outre movie will no doubt find something of interest here.

674024,AXLW246TETRY1,B00005QAP1,Lunchbox,"[0, 0]","(Minor Spoilers)The Item is on the same shelf than movies like Evil Dead. It has many elements that could easily make it a cult favorite: some funny characters (especially Alex), a weak and basic storyline, killer drag queens, a speaking creature, an extremely exaggerated amount of blood, and some sexual content involving a human girl and the creature.The Item leaves a first impression, right after the first viewing...the impression that I've watched something very weird, and it left me with a curious doubt about my appreciation of the film. After watching it, I didn't know either if it was a &quot;brilliant&quot; movie or just a stupid piece of entertaining, bloody trash. And I still doubt.First, I'll summarize the storyline. It's about a bunch of felons (four of them, and they can be pretty funny) who rob an item to some kind of weird man that really looks like the bad guy in a cheap Sci-Fi movie featuring Frank Zagarino, if you know what I mean. This mysterious item will supposedly make them rich...and I still don't know how the heck it could! So, they go to one of Alex's friends' house, in which they find her Drag Queen friends...so, these &quot;guys&quot; being witnesses, the four felons have to kill them, and then starts a bloody gun fight. After that (you know who won the fight), they go back to the house, and they have supper...but the &quot;item&quot; is about to get more involved in the story. So, curiosity can be a human flaw, and Alex and his pals open the box, to see what is inside. I won't tell you what it is, even though I'm not the first to review this film on IMDb, and many other people gave away the &quot;punch&quot; (even though we know pretty early in the movie what is inside the box). Not that the &quot;item&quot; is dangerous itself, it's not a powerful creature with fangs sharper than knives...but it is dangerous in a completely different way: it somehow reads someone's mind and turns it against other people. So, as you've probably seen before in kidnaping movies (Suicide Kings comes to my mind), where the victim has discussions with its kidnapers and turns them against each other, this movie is exactly like this, but instead of a normal person being kidnaped, it's a creature.But if the creature was the only original point in the movie, that wouldn't be enough. So they put some humoristic touches, in the dialogue and in the visuals. The dialogue is often funny, and some other comical parts are the creature itself (you have to see it to understand), the costumes (especially the Drag Queens'), and of course, the gore. Now, I'll explain what the gore is about. This film is not gory like Evil Dead is gory. The Item is, I'd say, bloody. Pretty bloody. There is one scene with a brain, and some organs, but besides that, the only &quot;gore&quot; you see is red liquid. There is a lot of it, the amounts are very exaggerated, and that's very funny at times (Major Spoiler: when Alex gets shot, there is an incredible amount of blood that sprays on the wall, and, after he got the bullet in his chest, he begins choking a little bit, and you see some more blood spurting on the wall as he chokes, it's put in a pretty funny way). There are some funny violent scenes, which is a necessary point for a film of this kind (see Bad Taste, Braindead, Evil Dead, Story of Ricky, and others).Now, in a more serious tone, I can say that The Item's directing is pretty average, I'd even say that it is below average at times, with a couple of weak camera effects that just remind you how amateurish this is. But amateurish doesn't mean bad, not at all! I'd even say it more than often is a pleasure to watch independent and low-budget movies like this...I loved Bad Taste, but the directing was not good at all...Not that the directing in a movie is not important, I would never say that, but for movies like this one, it won't stop me from loving them.The acting is extended on many levels. There are very good actors in this film as much as there are weak ones. Mr.Clark is the best (and he's the director too!) actor in this movie, I think. His character is attaching, funny, and in the same leagues than Ash (from Evil Dead), Derek (from Bad Taste) or Lionel (from Braindead)...he surely has his own style, though. He is smart, fast-thinking, he has a conscience, he can be violent, he has fun lines, he's a great character.The scenario is very simple, but what else could we expect? If this had De Palma's Mission:Impossible's scenario, the film would really suck. The Item doesn't take itself too seriously, but I have to admit that in the end it becomes a little too serious. I still believe that the ending is cool, but the scene before is pretty stupid (when the Chinese girl has sex with the creature).Overall, it's hard to know if this was good or bad, this was certainly not a masterpiece, but as a future cult favorite, even though it won't be the best, I give it a 6/10, because it has flaws and even with some of the jokes and everything, this will never be as fun to watch as Braindead, never.6/10Note: If you liked this, watch the films I've mentioned above.",3,This is today's version of cult movies,1065484800,"10 7, 2003",2003,5129,"['Minor', 'Spoilers', 'Item',

White ""impossiblefunky""","[2, 6]","It might have been the cappuccino or being punch drunk from jet lag but Dan Clark comes across as a hilariously hyper guy.  His film, THE ITEM, reflects Clark's personality in its kinetic, balls out, over-the-top mirth and mayhem.  Everything in THE ITEM has been kicked up to the nth degree.THE ITEM is the story of four unlikely gangsters who have taken on the task of babysitting a science experiment gone wrong--an oversized fleshy slug with keen powers of observation.  The film has been described as being an effort in ""art exploitation."" With its mix of stylish filmmaking and copious gore, the label is one that seems destined to stick.""I had a love-hate relationship with all the RESERVOIR DOGS rip-offs that were coming out and I liked the idea of a claustrophobic little cheap indie film with a bunch of bad guys with guns in the room.  I thought it was getting too serious and getting too dull.  No one was playing with it enough,"" says Clark.""The evolution from Peckinpah to Woo back to America: it starts to feel like a bunch of dogs eating each other's vomit.  I thought it'd be fun to fun to take the piss out of that a little bit.  In addition to that, I'm a big fan of THE SEVEN FACES OF DR. LAO where there's that scene where the mean businessman goes in and has a conversation with a hand puppet--that rocked.""""I wrote the film in a week.  We sunk most of the money we got from the Jim Henson company [for a first look deal on ""Brats of the Lost Nebula""] into THE ITEM.  And, you know, they weren't pleased.  They didn't want us to take that money and make a bloodbath phallus puppet movie.""Shot on digital video, Clark tweaked the color in post-production, enhancing and emphasizing the shades in order to give more of a cartoonish look.  ""I've always gotten a big kick out of the way Peter Greenaway color codes everything, so I made THE ITEM extremely orange.  Most of the characters except for the two female leads have different colored hair and very different colored clothes.""Released in both rated and unrated versions by Artisan Entertainment, the version with extra-gore kicks the violence into the realm of being funny and outrageous while the R-rated cut is more disturbing than humorous.

Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY IT, DO NOT RENT IT, AND IF SOMEONE GAVE IT TO YOU DO NOT TAKE IT!!With faulty reviews and setup, it makes you think the movie was going to be a real thriller, but after about a couple of minutes, you'll find yourself saying &quot;oh my god I wished I didn't get this movie&quot;. I got to say, it is a major waste of time and if you don't have a life or you can't tell the difference between what a good movie and a bad movie is, than go ahead and see it. I thought this movie was a college class project, that's how horrible it was, it's a joke! A lot of lame bloody scenes, a major lot of cussing, some nasty offensive moments, combined with some dumb trigger crazy peeps and a worm-like creature COMBINED with bad filming, bad directing, bad plots, and bad everything is what this movie is all about. I stopped about 3/4 way through, trying to see if the movie ever gets better. In the end I wasted time and I couldn't get a refund.
