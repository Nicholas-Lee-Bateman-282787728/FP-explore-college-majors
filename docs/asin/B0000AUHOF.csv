767985,A15NJKYBSTIVHW,B0000AUHOF,"Bmonster ""exile103""","[5, 6]","This film was inspired and is partly based on the S.E. Hinton novel of the same title. However, a modicum of research will tell you that Emilio Estevez wrote the screenplay, not Hinton. Ergo, do NOT expect it to be exactly like the book. Film is one medium, literature is another. To compare them is odious and unfair to both.Estevez and Sheffer both do a decent job in this emotional story of two young men who go from inseparable to at odds with one another as they begin to drift apart. Estevez wants everything to stay the same: hanging out, slacking off and committing petty crime. The bad boy image and ways will take them nowhere good, and the film's tension comes from Brian (Sheffer)learning this with help from his new girlfriend (Kim Delaney) and trying to leave it behind while Mark fights the idea only to end up a drug-damaged reprobate with a dismal future.",3,Don't expect the book.

It shows many areas that have changed over the years. Plus its an 80s movie with Emilio, if you grew up in this era it might bring memories to you as well. I have never read the book so as the movie stands its alright. Its a must see if you are familiar with the eastside of saint paul in the 80s.

767989,AW1TYENSI11UK,B0000AUHOF,"Remy LeBeau ""Gambit""","[0, 0]","I bought this DVD a few weeks back for an inflated price so I could see and own one of my favorite movies from when I was growing up. The movie is excellent and I had not seen it in 15+ yrs so i could not remember much about it when I seen it. I did realize a couple of things about the film vs book when I watched it though. WARNING Potential SpoilersThe ending had an exceptionally strong ""War on Drugs in the 80's"" ending, as Bryon exiled his lifelong friend over one incident with drugs. Rather than trying to reach out to him, he wrote him off like he never existed and had his butt thrown in jail. WTF? Like anyone would do that to someone they cared so much about. Also, finally, for the people who complained that Ponyboy Curtis did not make an appearance in the That Was Then, This Is Now movie like he did with the book need to open thier eyes. He is the blond haired kid at the dance hanging out with Mark. Although he has no lines, he is plain as day in the scene at the dance inside the school and out in the parking lot before, during, and after the fight Angela Shepards friend. He is wearing the bright yellow jacket...you cannot miss him.Anyhow, this is an excellent film and any fan of SE Hinton, the Outsiders, or 1980's movies should appeciate it, if you can find a copy you are willing to pay the price for.",5,Excellent Hard to Find Film,1252886400,"09 14, 2009",2009,1328,"['bought', 'DVD', 'few', 'weeks', 'back', 'inflated', 'price', 'could', 'see', 'own', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'movie', 'excellent', 'had', 'not', 'seen', '15+', 'yrs', 'so', 'i', 'could', 'not', 'remember', 'much', 'when', 'seen', 'did', 'realize', 'couple', 'things', 'film', 'vs', 'book', 'when', 'watched', 'WARNING', 'Potential', 'SpoilersThe', 'ending', 'had', 'exceptionally', 'strong', 'War', 'Drugs', '80', 'ending', 'Bryon', 'exiled', 'lifelong', 'friend', 'one', 'incident', 'drugs', 'Rather', 'trying', 'reach', 'out', 'wrote', 'off', 'never', 'existed', 'had', 'butt', 'thrown', 'jail', 'WTF', 'anyone', 'would', 'do', 'someone', 'cared', 'so', 'much', 'Also', 'finally', 'people', 'who', 'complained', 'Ponyboy', 'Curtis', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'appearance', 'Was', 'Then', 'Now', 'movie', 'did', 'book', 'need', 'open', 'thier', 'eyes', 'blond', 'haired', 'kid', 'dance', 'hanging', 'out', 'Mark', 'lines', 'plain', 'day', 'scene', 'dance', 'school', 'parking', 'lot', 'fight', 'Angela', 'Shepards', 'friend', 'wearing', 'bright', 'yellow', 'jacket', 'can', 'not', 'miss', 'him.Anyhow', 'excellent', 'film', 'fan', 'SE', 'Hinton', 'Outsiders', '1980', 'movies', 'should', 'appeciate', 'can', 'find', 'copy', 'are', 'willing', 'pay', 'price']",N/A
