It's not a Tommy and Tuppence story but very well could be.  Warwick and Annis are wonderful together, as usual, as they investigate and eventually solve the mystery.  The story has many twists and turns and will keep your interest most of the time.  However, the movie is just too long.  It clocks in at just over 3 hours.  The story just doesn't justify such a lengthy treatment.  They could have trimmed it down to just over 2 hours.  However, it is still a solid mystery with good performances by all the actors and actresses involved.  If you're a Tommy and Tuppence fan, I would especially recommend it.  It's one of the better Agatha Christie films I've watched, despite the lack of editing.",4,"Entertaining, But Long Agatha Christie Mystery",1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,823,"['Tommy', 'Tuppence', 'stars', 'James', 'Warwick', 'Francesca', 'Annis', 'are', 'paired', 'up', 'intriguing', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'murder', 'mystery', 'not', 'Tommy', 'Tuppence', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'be', 'Warwick', 'Annis', 'are', 'wonderful', 'together', 'usual', 'investigate', 'eventually', 'solve', 'mystery', 'story', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'will', 'keep', 'interest', 'most', 'time', 'However', 'movie', 'just', 'too', 'long', 'just', '3', 'hours', 'story', 'just', ""n't"", 'justify', 'such', 'lengthy', 'treatment', 'could', 'have', 'trimmed', 'down', 'just', '2', 'hours', 'However', 'still', 'solid', 'mystery', 'good', 'performances', 'actors', 'actresses', 'involved', ""'re"", 'Tommy', 'Tuppence', 'fan', 'would', 'especially', 'recommend', 'one', 'better', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'films', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'lack', 'editing']",Agatha Christie's Why Didn't They Ask Evans?

He would most assuredly hit someone if the ball just gets that far. He hears a cry but just plays on. That is until the search for the ball takes him to the edge of the cliff where it appears that a hiker fell on the rocks below. Bobby rushes to the aid of the fallen man. The fallen man come conscious just long enough to say ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"" then expires.From here characters pour in from all sides and you need to keep a score card and there are several doctors and mysteriously guilty looking people. You may guess some of the story but not all as they hold back most of clues until the last moment.Once again Britton has excelled in bringing a great Agatha Christie story to life. They did not try to overstate or rush through the story. Also true to Christies writing they left in the characters instead of trying to homogenize them into fewer numbers for TV's sake.We recognize the actors for other such stories:James Warwick who trained at the Central School in London also played Tommy in Agatha Christie's ""Partners in Crime"" series.Francesca Annis was Tuppence in the ""Partners in Crime"" series. But where I remember her most as Lady Jessica in ""Dune"" (1984).Sir John Gielgud, a graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic arts in London played Hamlet on the stage.The big surprise is the late Joan Hickson who made her stage debut in prudential theater in 1927 and played the best Miss Marple in the Agatha Christie series of movies.

743468,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00008K772,C. O. DeRiemer,"[8, 8]","A golf game on a windy bluff above the sea, a cry, a man lying on the rocks below who struggles to say with his dying breath, ""Why didn't they ask Evans?"" And we're off on a three-hour Agatha Christie tale of family deception, murder, lies and ruthless intrigue. We're also thrust into the Twenties and early Thirties' world of wealthy English bright young things, a world of upper-crust accents, immaculate manners and immaculate croquet grounds, country homes with many rooms and even more servants, and gleaming autos almost as long as a cricket pitch.This TV movie, originally a three-part British television production, would seem to have everything. So why is it unsatisfying? And why, as unsatisfying as I think it is, is it still amusing to watch? The unsatisfying parts first. 1) The story goes on and on. It easily could have been cut by at least half an hour. 2) The mystery is convoluted and hard to follow. 3) The two sleuths, Lady Frances Derwent (Francesca Annis) and Bobby Jones (James Warwick) got a bit on my nerves. Bobby is brave, a puppy dog around Frankie and not too smart. Frankie is very much the bright young thing, superficially brittle with hidden warmth, clever and, to my taste, a bit too self-satisfied. I never forgot that I was watching actors. 4) The direction is heavy handed, as if the director felt he had to nudge us that we're watching a slightly silly period piece. The background music is frequently used to emphasize things that don't need to be emphasized.What makes it watchable? Style, story and several of the actors. 1) This production looks great. The stately homes, inside and out, provide wonderful settings for distinctly upper class life. The period clothes for both the men and women look authentic and are often elegant. Dressing for dinner never looked better. 2) While the story is convoluted, it carries within it enough false leads to keep one's interest. The solution to the mystery and the answer to the dying man's question is clever. 3) Despite the artificiality of Annis' performance, she's a good enough actress to keep me watching her. It's style over substance, and she carries off the style handily. One of the important roles, who may be a diversion to the plot or may be a key ingredient, is played by Eric Porter, a fine actor. This was one of his last roles. He plays Dr. Nicholson, who runs a discrete clinic for disturbed relatives of wealthy families. The doctor is solicitous and alarming at the same time. Porter does a great job. If you have a chance, watch him as Soames in the early TV production of the Forsyte Saga. He was, in my view, an exceptional actor. In smaller roles Bernard Miles and John Gielgud show up. Joan Hickson makes an appearance looking utterly different from Miss Marple.On balance, I think this is a show you might like if you're fond of British mysteries involving the upper class and don't expect a classic. You'll need to appreciate Lady Frances...but as Bobby tells her at the close, ""You were so frightfully plucky...""The DVD transfer is soft but not too bad.

743469,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B00008K772,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[25, 25]","In 1981 London Weekend Television presented a three hour adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel WHY DIDN'T THEY ASK EVANS? (starring two actors who would go on to play Tommy and Tuppence in another series of Christie mysteries) James Warwick and Francesca (DUNE) Annis. In this adventure the two play amateur sleuths Bobby Jones and Lady Frankie Derwent in a 1920s murder investigation caper.The story opens with Jones tackling a game of golf on the Welsh coast. Playing his ball onto the edge of a cliff he comes across the body of a man lying on the rocks below and his companion (the local doctor) goes to fetch help (seems a little backwards, but no matter). Regaining consciousness briefly the man utters the cryptic words `Why didn't the ask Evans?' and then passes away. Jones finds a copy of a ladies picture in the man's pocket - a woman he feels an obvious attraction towards.Passing on the role of watcher over the dead body to a passing man so he can keep an appointment, Jones takes of without thinking anything of it but that it was a tragic accident.However his suspicions are raised when the man's body is identified by means of the police tracing the girl depicted on the photograph they find on his body. However, this girls photograph is of a different person than that which he discovered.What follows is an intriguing and well acted made-for-television feature. I did not notice any particular problems with the picture as was noted in other reviews, but the sound level did fade in and out and was at times distracting.

Filled with never ending complications and a strange list of suspects, the story is primarily played for laughs.  The best of the humor is provided by Joan Hickson and John Gielgud.  Unfortunately, their characters are under utilized in only a couple of scenes.  The bulk of the silliness is left to Francesca Annis (Lady Frankie Derwent) and James Warwick (Bobby Jones).  Both are a bit dim but enthusiastic to solve the case of a dead man found on a beach, his dying words: ""Why didn't they ask Evans?""  These two untalented amateurs don't start investigating in earnest though, until someone attempts to poison Bobby.  ""Who'd want to put you out of the way?""  After that, it's a slow slog through false clues with a couple of clueless sleuths who take forever to get to the source of the intrigue.  Along the way, they continuously throw themselves into dangerous situations, they keep making the mistake of trusting the wrong people, and they continuously fail to notice the obvious until it's almost too late.

743476,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00008K772,mirasreviews,"[1, 2]","""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"" was adapted by London Weekend Television in 1980 from the 1934 Agatha Christie novel of the same name. It's notable for being a long and faithful adaptation and for being the first in a series of successful Agatha Christie television adaptations following the author's death. In the Welsh seaside town of Marchbolt, Bobby Jones (James Warwick) and Dr. Thomas (Bernard Miles) are out golfing when they spot a man (Roy Boyd) who has fallen off of a cliff onto the rocks below. His injuries prove fatal, but before the man dies, he says to Bobby, ""Why didn't they ask Evans?"" Bobby removes a photograph of a lovely young woman from the dead man's pocket but replaces it before turning over watch duty to a passerby, Roger Bassington-French (Leigh Lawson), and rushing off to an appointment.Returning from a London job hunt, of which his sour father the Reverend Jones (John Gielgud) does not approve, Bobby runs into a childhood friend on the train. The beautiful and stylish Lady Frances ""Frankie"" Derwent (Francesca Annis) is pleased to see him and thrilled to learn that Bobby will be testifying at the inquest concerning the death at the cliff, which she has read about in the newspaper. At the inquest, the woman in the photograph, Mrs. Amelia Cayman (Mitzi Rogers), apparently the sister of the deceased, testifies as to his identity. Bobby thinks that Mrs. Cayman doesn't resemble the photograph but thinks little of it -until someone puts a near-fatal dose of morphine in his beer. Frankie convinces Bobby that this must have something to do with the death, and she takes the initiative in what will be a long and convoluted investigation.This adaptation includes more scenes and dialogue from the book than are strictly necessary, which account for a 3 hour 8 minute running time. For the first half of the film, it sometimes feels like we are hearing too much of the characters' thought processes. The interior scenes have an awkward staginess, like a play that was filmed. The cast is terrific, though, including a memorable supporting performance by Joan Hickson as the flamboyant and plain-spoken Mrs. Rivington. The detective duo of Frankie and Bobby are adventurous but nave, in a charming way.

The filming comes off as sort of soap-opera-ie for the indoor shots but the outdoor scenes are A-O-K.

Actually, it doesn't matter because this is an enjoyable 1920s mystery romp with just enough humor and romance blended into the more serious goings-on to please most everyone.  It's amazing how complex and LONG a story this is. I checked the online description and the back of the box, but I couldn't discover if this had been a television mini-series or just a lengthy made-for-TV movie.  Even though it's lots of fun, it does seem to go on forever!The lead characters, played by Francesca Annis and James Warwick, are just as attractive a couple as they are in Tommy and Tuppence, except they don't seem to realize it until they've both had romantic &quot;flings&quot; with other characters in the cast. The sets and costumes look authentic 1920s, and the cars are particularly interesting, especially in the used car lot.The only reluctance I had for giving this DVD release 5 stars is because of the uneven look of the movie itself.  Sometimes this looks like sharply focused videotape, and at other times it looks like fuzzy film.  This is probably because of the source material from 1980 rather than the fault of the DVD production, but it still should be noted.
