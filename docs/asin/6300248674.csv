228842,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,6300248674,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[2, 2]","Insanity, passion and sex are the themes for this beautiful but sombering French film.  Betty Blue won a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, but lost to The Assault, from the Netherlands.This is a story of a handyman, Zorg, (Jean-Hugues Anglade  who is also a struggling writer, and he meets a young girl Betty Blue, played brilliantly by B&eacute;atrice Dalle,These two lovers are so carefree and passionate, and frontal nudity situations that exclude sex, quite often.  I shouted to the screen.... ""can you two put some clothes on once in a while?""  The film starts with their relationship filled with over zealous sex.  For it's time period, and of course being French, there are explicit sex scenes.  As many films do for instant attention, there is an overly lengthy sex scene that opens the movie.Betty works alongside the handman, first painting houses.  Her fiery temper seems not to endanger anyone, until the story progresses and Betty is considered violent, and extremely dangerous to others and herself.  The mood easily shifts from zany and outrageous adventures to depressing chaotic endangerment.  It takes a while to see the character Betty slowly descend to madness.The two are as they say... made for each other.  There is a deep bond that shows with the characters as Zorg is determined to stand by his woman.I love the picturesque and quaint home scenes filled with color and character, plus the outdoors sweeping view.  This is my first movie with director Jean-Jacques Beineix.  There are at least two versions, one being over three hours.",5,"Dark, moody..... a maddening descent",1319846400,"10 29, 2011",2011,1568,"['Insanity', 'passion', 'sex', 'are', 'themes', 'beautiful', 'sombering', 'French', 'film', 'Betty', 'Blue', 'won', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', 'lost', 'Assault', 'Netherlands.This', 'story', 'handyman', 'Zorg', 'Jean-Hugues', 'Anglade', 'who', 'also', 'struggling', 'writer', 'young', 'girl', 'Betty', 'Blue', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'B', 'eacute', 'Dalle', 'two', 'lovers', 'are', 'so', 'carefree', 'passionate', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'situations', 'exclude', 'sex', 'quite', 'often', 'shouted', 'screen', 'can', 'two', 'put', 'clothes', 'once', 'while', 'film', 'relationship', 'filled', 'zealous', 'sex', 'time', 'period', 'course', 'being', 'French', 'are', 'explicit', 'sex', 'scenes', 'many', 'films', 'do', 'instant', 'attention', 'overly', 'lengthy', 'sex', 'scene', 'movie.Betty', 'handman', 'first', 'painting', 'houses', 'fiery', 'temper', 'not', 'endanger', 'anyone', 'story', 'progresses', 'Betty', 'considered', 'violent', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'others', 'mood', 'easily', 'shifts', 'zany', 'outrageous', 'adventures', 'depressing', 'chaotic', 'endangerment', 'while', 'see', 'character', 'Betty', 'slowly', 'descend', 'madness.The', 'two', 'are', 'say', 'made', 'other', 'deep', 'bond', 'characters', 'Zorg', 'determined', 'stand', 'woman.I', 'love', 'picturesque', 'quaint', 'home', 'scenes', 'filled', 'color', 'character', 'outdoors', 'sweeping', 'view', 'first', 'movie', 'director', 'Jean-Jacques', 'Beineix', 'are', 'least', 'two', 'versions', 'one', 'being', 'three', 'hours']",N/A

Right after I saw this one I was schedule for a month long solo meditation retreat! Argh!!! I couldn't get this movie out of my mind, the attractive characters, the tragic story.... I sat with this story for hours, days, weeks....it was emotionally draining, and I was not left thinking it was weak or shallow. It was a metaphor for our foolish hopes, dreams and fears, with a sense of redemption in the end or at least unending continuity. It is truely tragic. Like a Richard Thompson song of lost love, seemingly happy situations develop to reveal the maddness they always were. (The director begins with the most powerful intro imaginable, raw realistic sex - Is that just the way the French are, or are they trying to shock US? - Betty is mad from the getgo, it's just we see her go from an infectious passionate manicness to an all consuming depression. It is her craziness that makes her seem so alive and attractive. Her passion is enviable and seductive until we see the flip-side. And then there is the inverse reaction for her lover Zorg as he continues with his existential awakening...Oh cruel, crazy, beautiful world.)This may not be a ""great"" movie, but it is powerful, poignant, lyrical, and oh yes, sexy...., and the acting and direction are near perfect.(NOTE: This longer ""director's cut"" edition, totalling more than 3 hours, detracted from my memory of the theatre version, and while it did help flesh out the characters I think it went on too long without adding much. This could have been edited down to an hour and a half and been truely amazing, and eminently more reviewable.)",5,So Blue....,1103587200,"12 21, 2004",2004,1928,"['want', 'write', 'response', 'one', 'highlighted', 'reviews', 'sums', 'movie', 'up', 'sexy', 'artistic', 'lots', 'eye', 'candy', 'otherwise', 'having', 'pretty', 'empty', 'story.I', 'first', 'saw', 'theaters', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'mid', '80', 'time', 'when', 'saw', 'one', 'two', 'movies', 'year', 'inevitably', 'effected', 'profoundly', 'Right', 'saw', 'one', 'was', 'schedule', 'month', 'long', 'solo', 'meditation', 'retreat', 'Argh', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie', 'mind', 'attractive', 'characters', 'tragic', 'story', 'sat', 'story', 'hours', 'days', 'weeks', '.it', 'was', 'emotionally', 'draining', 'was', 'not', 'left', 'thinking', 'was', 'weak', 'shallow', 'was', 'metaphor', 'foolish', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'fears', 'sense', 'redemption', 'end', 'least', 'unending', 'continuity', 'truely', 'tragic', 'Richard', 'Thompson', 'song', 'lost', 'love', 'seemingly', 'happy', 'situations', 'develop', 'reveal', 'maddness', 'always', 'were', 'director', 'most', 'powerful', 'intro', 'imaginable', 'raw', 'realistic', 'sex', 'just', 'way', 'French', 'are', 'are', 'trying', 'shock', 'US', 'Betty', 'mad', 'getgo', 'just', 'see', 'go', 'infectious', 'passionate', 'manicness', 'consuming', 'depression', 'craziness', 'seem', 'so', 'alive', 'attractive', 'passion', 'enviable', 'seductive', 'see', 'flip-side', 'then', 'inverse', 'reaction', 'lover', 'Zorg', 'existential', 'awakening', 'Oh', 'cruel', 'crazy', 'beautiful', 'world', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'powerful', 'poignant', 'lyrical', 'oh', 'yes', 'sexy', 'acting', 'direction', 'are', 'perfect', 'NOTE', 'longer', 'director', 'cut', 'edition', 'totalling', 'more', '3', 'hours', 'detracted', 'memory', 'theatre', 'version', 'did', 'help', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'think', 'went', 'too', 'long', 'adding', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'down', 'hour', 'half', 'been', 'truely', 'amazing', 'eminently', 'more', 'reviewable']",N/A

228845,A13ZPQNYAWRII9,6300248674,burneyfan@btinternet.com,"[28, 29]","This is a heartbreakingly tragic film centred around Betty, (Beatrice Dalle) a beautiful but unstable young woman, whose  instability - or madness - becomes progressively worse throughout the film. In the beginning we think she is just an admirablely  rebellious and fiery person who is over-sensitive to slight and imagined insult. Later she is engulfed by these irrational and self-destructive bouts of hysteria for no perceptible reason. But this happens only occasionally;  between times she behaves like a perfectly normal and happy person, as she has every reason to be. It is easy to  become impatient with her. She keeps saying she has nothing to live for, that nothing she has ever done has worked out right, but how can this be  when she is so much better off than so many millions of others,  with beauty, two good friends and a good man who loves her to distraction despite everything? And she loves him in return.Zorg (Jean-Hughes Anglalde) is an aspiring novelist  with a novel in manuscript he has  given up all hope of ever seeing published. But she believes in him and, using only two fingers, types  out the manuscript with painful slowness, and, with an heroic persistence, continues sending it out to the publishers despite  receiving a steady stream of rejection slips. And here-in lies the  tragedy ; at the end of the film, when she is dead to the world and past caring, her efforts bear fruit and the manuscript is accepted. How happy knowing this would have made her. But too late.We leave him alone in his kitchen about to start a new novel, a novel that she will never see, leading to  a success and prosperity she will have no share in. My God  isn't that sad? ""What might have been."" the saddest words in the English language.The pain lies in imagining the long and happy life they might have had together, but for this thing that mad people have, whatever it is, gnawing away inside her mind.  No explanation is attempted of why she was the way she was, no revelation of some childhood trauma or of some past bitter experience. We are left to assume  that she had some brain or genetic defect. Nor are we given any psychiatric diagnoses. It is mentioned at one point that she is neurotic, but then aren't we all?  She mentions hearing voices in her head which is  the classic symptom of Schizophrenia, but her other behaviour doesn't fit the pattern. Nor does her behaviour fit the pattern of the Manic-depressive. who, surely, is subject only to mood-swings not to sudden and violently wild outburst of behaviour. So we are left to ponder the nature of madness. It makes you think and it's all interesting stuff.This is a long film, but with a wealth of interest and by no means  depressing; there are many happy sequences and  funny moments, and the acting is uniformly excellent.",4,A heartbreakingly tragic film.,979430400,"01 14, 2001",2001,2812,"['heartbreakingly', 'tragic', 'film', 'centred', 'Betty', 'Beatrice', 'Dalle', 'beautiful', 'unstable', 'young', 'woman', 'instability', 'madness', 'becomes', 'progressively', 'worse', 'film', 'beginning', 'think', 'just', 'admirablely', 'rebellious', 'fiery', 'person', 'who', 'over-sensitive', 'slight', 'imagined', 'insult', 'Later', 'engulfed', 'irrational', 'self-destructive', 'bouts', 'hysteria', 'perceptible', 'reason', 'only', 'occasionally', 'times', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'happy', 'person', 'reason', 'be', 'easy', 'become', 'impatient', 'saying', 'nothing', 'live', 'nothing', 'ever', 'done', 'worked', 'out', 'right', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'off', 'so', 'many', 'millions', 'others', 'beauty', 'two', 'good', 'friends', 'good', 'man', 'who', 'distraction', 'everything', 'return.Zorg', 'Jean-Hughes', 'Anglalde', 'aspiring', 'novelist', 'novel', 'manuscript', 'given', 'up', 'hope', 'ever', 'seeing', 'published', 'using', 'only', 'two', 'fingers', 'types', 'out', 'manuscript', 'painful', 'slowness', 'heroic', 'persistence', 'sending', 'publishers', 'receiving', 'steady', 'stream', 'rejection', 'slips', 'here-in', 'tragedy', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'dead', 'world', 'past', 'caring', 'efforts', 'bear', 'fruit', 'manuscript', 'accepted', 'How', 'happy', 'knowing', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'too', 'late.We', 'leave', 'alone', 'kitchen', 'start', 'new', 'novel', 'novel', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'leading', 'success', 'prosperity', 'will', 'have', 'share', 'My', 'God', ""n't"", 'sad', 'What', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'saddest', 'words', 'English', 'language.The', 'pain', 'imagining', 'long', 'happy', 'life', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'together', 'thing', 'mad', 'people', 'have', 'whatever', 'gnawing', 'away', 'mind', 'explanation', 'attempted', 'why', 'was', 'way', 'was', 'revelation', 'childhood', 'trauma', 'past', 'bitter', 'experience', 'are', 'left', 'assume', 'had', 'brain', 'genetic', 'defect', 'are', 'given', 'psychiatric', 'diagnoses', 'mentioned', 'one', 'point', 'neurotic', 'then', 'are', ""n't"", 'hearing', 'voices', 'head', 'classic', 'symptom', 'Schizophrenia', 'other', 'behaviour', ""n't"", 'fit', 'pattern', 'behaviour', 'fit', 'pattern', 'Manic-depressive', 'who', 'surely', 'subject', 'only', 'mood-swings', 'not', 'sudden', 'violently', 'wild', 'outburst', 'behaviour', 'are', 'left', 'ponder', 'nature', 'madness', 'think', 'interesting', 'stuff.This', 'long', 'film', 'wealth', 'interest', 'means', 'depressing', 'are', 'many', 'happy', 'sequences', 'funny', 'moments', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'excellent']",N/A
228846,A30CJA09ZUUBJ4,6300248674,"Charlie Spivey ""Gamer""","[2, 3]","First, I saw this movie in the late 80s. The version was 117 mins in length. This version is 177 Mins in length ( the other Directors cut is listed at 185 mins ). Althought this move is showing that it was released by Sony Home Entertainment, it wasn't. It was released by a Korean distributer and is heavily censored. The Movie is intact story wise, just the visuals were censored. I was very unhappy with the fact that I didn't get what I ordered and it seemed to be bait & switch to me. If the movie was the censored Korean version, than it should have been stated as such. At the time, it was the only extended version available as I think the Lion's Gate version was out of print. I gave it two stars for the reason that it wasn't what I ordered and just felt incomplete. Another thing was in the way it was censored, I found it to be very distracting.As for the Story and acting, it gets at least a 4 Star rating as it is a good story. It is a bit ""Arty"" or Avant Garde, but I do enjoy those types of films for the most part. Not all are good, but this one was great. I had initially seen the theatrical release and really enjoyed it. This version has a lot more footage added. It doesn't really add anything to the movie,per se, as the implications were certainly there in the original version. This version, just takes the implications to a hard reality. Although the movie is good, the censoring, as I said, is distracting.

It is the story of a beautiful girl, Betty, who moves in with a ""wandering spirit"", Zorg. Together they struggle to find themselves good jobs to make a worthy living, but not all is at easy as it seems. Betty has a very passive-aggressive temperament that sometimes leaves Zorg scratching his head. She is also obsessed with getting Zorg's attempt at writing published, which also bothers him a bit. Throughout their various colorful adventures, a Betty nobody knew begins to unfold before our eyes, and conditions thus become less and less favorable for the couple. In sum, we are invited to witness her descent into the deepest unbalance.Beatrice Dalle is adorable and compelling as Betty, and one is capable of liking the character not for her physical attractive but for her bubbly personality, her contagious little girl laughter, and her innocence... even despite her ""tantrums"", which initially seem exaggerated until the pills become of our knowing.Betty Blue may also come off as a movie with no depth, or a shiny product that is purely plastic (I believed it to be so upon first view), but with time the story becomes warm, exciting, and beautiful, despite its length. There is beauty in watching all of Zorg's and Betty's adventures, and the intimacy they share with their friends-- drinking, dancing, just having good ol' fun-- transcends the screen. On the other hand you have Betty's unstable temper, product of an unrevealed schizophrenia that reaches its peak by the end of the film and puts an end to the captivating, chere love story between Betty and Zorg.The film has some visually stunning moments, and the color palette overall is rich, primary and ""inviting"", if such adjective can be applied in this case. The dialogue is casual, don't expect anything intellectual or very thought-provoking.All in all, it is a movie purely aimed at the heart, which might explain why it may appear simple and superficial at first.

Curran ""dfcurran""","[7, 8]","A publisher sends ""this is the worst book I ever read"" rejection letter to her boyfriend and Betty goes to the publisher's house and stabs him with a fork.  Unfortunately, this is a sign of Betty's mental decline, and her love.  This is a love story set with blue lighting (the director magically works blue light in whenever possible.) , and one blue symphony that echoes throughout the movie (I'm not a music expert, but it seems to me most of the music is a variation of the same larger haunting work.)  The terrific acting kept me always in the story, forgetful I was watching a movie, and not real life, with that unselfconscious nudity only the French seem to be able to master.  So don't even worry what the French title: 372 le matin (32 1/2 degrees in the morning) means.I saw this in 1986 in an art theatre in Missoula Montana when I was in the creative writing program.  Probably a major influence in heading me toward movies rather than books.  What a fantasy for a writer!  You meet this incredibly, unsatiable, woman, who believes in you when you don't believe in yourself.  There is this incredible scene where she finds Zorg's (her boyfriend's) notebooks--he says they are nothing.  But she reads them, loves them, and comes to believe in him--more than he does in himself.  She urges him to submit his work--and rages at his rejections.Meanwhile, what was probably a sexual escapade for Zorg grows into real love, and concern as we begin to suspect that Betty is not quite right, that her overzealous reaction to the world is a slipping toward madness.

228852,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,6300248674,D. Mok,"[89, 92]","Betty Blue is touted as an ""erotic drama"" by the distributor, a tag which sells the film grossly short. It certainly has frank depictions of sexuality and much nudity -- after all, this is a film that opens on a real-time extended sequence shot of two people having sex -- but to call this erotica is to miss the complete picture.Betty Blue is an organic look at a troubled relationship in all its glory and ugliness, tenderness and violence, joys and sorrows, made possible by the director's sympathetic and unembarrassed eye, and the sheer dedication of lead actors Jean-Hugues Anglade and Beatrice Dalle. Seldom has a cinematic couple been better paired, and seldom with so much chemistry. Dalle conveys a world of psychological complexity in her face, her eyes seeming to shift with her inner beats. Dalle received the bulk of the attention for this, her breakthrough role, so it might be easy to overlook Jean-Hugues Anglade, a fantastic actor who's every bit as good as Gerard Depardieu, perhaps even half a notch above Jean Reno. In reality, he is the anchor for the film's wrenching emotional journey. When Zorg plays the piano theme for Betty, easily the loveliest scene in the film, Anglade's eyes seem to dance, and the actors say more with their looks during their moments together than all the sex scenes in the world. Thanks to the deft direction, all those nude scenes don't seem like titillation -- merely an illuminating fly-on-the-wall view into the relationship. This couple certainly seems like the type who would be comfortable being naked around each other, and those scenes create a sense of genuine intimacy, rather than intent to arouse.If there's one thing this film does well, it is the mixture of comedic and tragic scenes which makes it seem such a complete picture. Betty is not always wild and uncontrolled; Zorg is not always patient and loving. They are two flawed characters, made all the more likeable because of their flaws, and their interactions make us laugh, smile in understanding, frown, and cry.This extended edition makes the film far better. It's been about 10 years since I last saw it so I can't make very specific comparisons. But the restored scenes are substantial, not cosmetic addition of shots, but an explosion of the story, and while I can't name too many specifics, as a whole this version just feels more right, more natural, and more emotional.Look beyond the film's ""erotic"" reputation and find a character study, and a portrayal of a relationship, which is as moving as any I've seen.",5,Two haunting performances say it all.,1106956800,"01 29, 2005",2005,2544,"['Betty', 'Blue', 'touted', 'erotic', 'drama', 'distributor', 'tag', 'film', 'grossly', 'short', 'certainly', 'frank', 'depictions', 'sexuality', 'much', 'nudity', 'film', 'real-time', 'extended', 'sequence', 'shot', 'two', 'people', 'having', 'sex', 'call', 'erotica', 'miss', 'complete', 'picture.Betty', 'Blue', 'organic', 'look', 'troubled', 'relationship', 'glory', 'ugliness', 'tenderness', 'violence', 'joys', 'sorrows', 'made', 'possible', 'director', 'sympathetic', 'unembarrassed', 'eye', 'sheer', 'dedication', 'lead', 'actors', 'Jean-Hugues', 'Anglade', 'Beatrice', 'Dalle', 'Seldom', 'cinematic', 'couple', 'been', 'better', 'paired', 'seldom', 'so', 'much', 'chemistry', 'Dalle', 'conveys', 'world', 'psychological', 'complexity', 'face', 'eyes', 'seeming', 'shift', 'inner', 'beats', 'Dalle', 'received', 'bulk', 'attention', 'breakthrough', 'role', 'might', 'be', 'easy', 'overlook', 'Jean-Hugues', 'Anglade', 'fantastic', 'actor', 'who', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'perhaps', 'even', 'notch', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'reality', 'anchor', 'film', 'wrenching', 'emotional', 'journey', 'When', 'Zorg', 'piano', 'theme', 'Betty', 'easily', 'loveliest', 'scene', 'film', 'Anglade', 'eyes', 'seem', 'dance', 'actors', 'say', 'more', 'looks', 'moments', 'together', 'sex', 'scenes', 'world', 'Thanks', 'deft', 'direction', 'nude', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'titillation', 'merely', 'illuminating', 'fly-on-the-wall', 'view', 'relationship', 'couple', 'certainly', 'type', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'comfortable', 'being', 'naked', 'other', 'scenes', 'create', 'sense', 'genuine', 'intimacy', 'rather', 'intent', 'arouse.If', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'well', 'mixture', 'comedic', 'tragic', 'scenes', 'seem', 'such', 'complete', 'picture', 'Betty', 'not', 'always', 'wild', 'uncontrolled', 'Zorg', 'not', 'always', 'patient', 'loving', 'are', 'two', 'flawed', 'characters', 'made', 'more', 'likeable', 'flaws', 'interactions', 'make', 'smile', 'understanding', 'frown', 'cry.This', 'extended', 'edition', 'film', 'far', 'better', 'been', '10', 'years', 'last', 'saw', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'very', 'specific', 'comparisons', 'restored', 'scenes', 'are', 'substantial', 'not', 'cosmetic', 'addition', 'shots', 'explosion', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'name', 'too', 'many', 'specifics', 'whole', 'version', 'just', 'feels', 'more', 'right', 'more', 'natural', 'more', 'emotional.Look', 'film', 'erotic', 'reputation', 'find', 'character', 'study', 'portrayal', 'relationship', 'as', 'moving', ""'ve"", 'seen']",N/A

228866,A6ADO7B6FUVN,6300248674,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[11, 12]","Betty Blue will most certainly make many shake their heads will thinking why all the nudeness, is this really necessary, and so on and so forth.  In the American society violence is almost a must for the cable stations that display drama.  The violence is depicted through shootings, killings, and other disturbing images.  For some reason violence appears more acceptable than nakedness and sexuality that is so vividly expressed in Betty Blue.  Interestingly, American youth learn more about violence through history and social science than they learn about sexuality in sex education, if they are allowed to have it.  Anyway, it is natural to be born naked and it is natural to undressed when making love with a loved one, which often transcends the emotional feelings between two loving individuals.  Betty Blue transcends the audience through nakedness and existence into a natural state of love when uninterrupted.Jean-Jacques Beineix's film opens with a complete shot where the two main characters, Zorg (Jean-Hugues Anglade) and Betty (B&eacute;atrice Dalle), are making love on a bed.  It is obvious that they both have strong feelings for one another as both slowly build up their sexual arousal until it peaks with an emotional and physical explosion that slowly ebbs out.  When the orgasm fades away they continue to embrace one another in a very affectionate and caring manner.  It is a very warm and personal scene expressing the strong feelings that rest within both Zorg and Betty.  The scene has class in its detailed imagery of love making without exploiting the situation or crossing the border into pornography.At the end of the opening scene where Zorg gently kisses Betty, he says, ""I had known Betty for a week.  We screwed every night. The forecast was for storms.""  These storms that Zorg mentions will erupt sporadically with a climbing intensity.  The first brief storm arrives when Zorg works at a beach resort while living in one of the 500 beach bungalows that his boss forces him to paint by himself.  An impossible task for one person, but Zorg conforms to his boss's wish.  When Betty finds out that he is suppose to paint all bungalows she goes on a brief rampage throwing stuff out while discovering one of Zorg's personal achievements, a novel.  She reads it and determines that he is a brilliant writer that should focus on writing, but Zorg simply puts it off as he lacks the personal confidence.The film continues to climb to its crescendo in a similar way of an orgasm.  Evidently, there is something wrong with Betty, but Zorg stands firm next to her ready to support or defend her if necessary.  She is the only thing that has made him feel good in life, and he is not willing to part from her.  As Betty clings on to him, he clings on to her.  Their affection for one another continues to develop throughout the film where they become very comfortable and open about each other.  However, Betty's behavior becomes erratically violent whenever she feels pressured or helpless.  Despite the increasingly violent eruptions that Betty demonstrates Zorg denies what it is abnormal and dangerous, as he continues to do everything within his means to help her in his own way.The film delivers a multidimensional story of love, but many of the audience members might focus on the nudeness in the film.  The nakedness is not an unique incident in art history and should therefore not blind the audience.  Instead, the audience should embrace the nudeness as a normal part of the process of sexual love between two lovers.  Besides the natural nudeness there are aspects of love such as care, affection, support, joy, communication,  and the occasional disagreements.  After all, love never is perfect from the beginning, as it is something people  must continuously work on in order to keep it intact despite ups and downs in life.In this tragedy Beineix explores agony and joy of love through the camera lens and his caring way of framing scenes.  The care presents itself in how the characters are lined up in the scenes as well though the mise-en-scene, which provides additional elements that enhance themes within the film.  In addition, the camera movement and editing displays moments of genius.  For example, there is a brief scene with Betty standing on a bridge over a railway where a train is coming full speed towards the train while the camera is panning toward the right.  This scene induces the feeling that the train will crash into her, even though it is obvious that the train will safely pass.  Nonetheless, the scene suggests an inner turmoil within Betty in a very symbolical manner.The combination of the filmmaking, the story, and the performance of the actors delivers an exceptional cinematic experience.  At times the film is lyrical while swiftly being able to move towards a ominous situation where high levels of uncertainty generate anxiety.  The duality of humanity has been gently touched on in this film, but not thoroughly explored, which leaves the audience with a personal and artistic impression of what love truly can be.",5,Brilliantly Complex & Lyrically Affectionate Tragedy...,1120089600,"06 30, 2005",2005,5093,"['Betty', 'Blue', 'will', 'most', 'certainly', 'make', 'many', 'shake', 'heads', 'will', 'thinking', 'why', 'nudeness', 'really', 'necessary', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'American', 'society', 'violence', 'almost', 'must', 'cable', 'stations', 'display', 'drama', 'violence', 'depicted', 'shootings', 'killings', 'other', 'disturbing', 'images', 'reason', 'violence', 'more', 'acceptable', 'nakedness', 'sexuality', 'so', 'vividly', 'expressed', 'Betty', 'Blue', 'Interestingly', 'American', 'youth', 'learn', 'more', 'violence', 'history', 'social', 'science', 'learn', 'sexuality', 'sex', 'education', 'are', 'allowed', 'have', 'Anyway', 'natural', 'be', 'born', 'naked', 'natural', 'undressed', 'when', 'making', 'love', 'loved', 'one', 'often', 'emotional', 'feelings', 'two', 'loving', 'individuals', 'Betty', 'Blue', 'audience', 'nakedness', 'existence', 'natural', 'state', 'love', 'when', 'uninterrupted.Jean-Jacques', 'Beineix', 'film', 'complete', 'shot', 'where', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Zorg', 'Jean-Hugues', 'Anglade', 'Betty', 'B', 'eacute', 'Dalle', 'are', 'making', 'love', 'bed', 'obvious', 'have', 'strong', 'feelings', 'one', 'slowly', 'build', 'up', 'sexual', 'arousal', 'emotional', 'physical', 'explosion', 'slowly', 'out', 'When', 'orgasm', 'away', 'continue', 'embrace', 'one', 'very', 'affectionate', 'caring', 'manner', 'very', 'warm', 'personal', 'scene', 'expressing', 'strong', 'feelings', 'rest', 'Zorg', 'Betty', 'scene', 'class', 'detailed', 'imagery', 'love', 'making', 'exploiting', 'situation', 'crossing', 'border', 'pornography.At', 'end', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'Zorg', 'gently', 'Betty', 'had', 'known', 'Betty', 'week', 'screwed', 'night', 'forecast', 'was', 'storms', 'storms', 'Zorg', 'mentions', 'will', 'erupt', 'sporadically', 'climbing', 'intensity', 'first', 'brief', 'storm', 'when', 'Zorg', 'beach', 'resort', 'living', 'one', '500', 'beach', 'bungalows', 'boss', 'paint', 'impossible', 'task', 'one', 'person', 'Zorg', 'conforms', 'boss', 'wish', 'When', 'Betty', 'out', 'suppose', 'paint', 'bungalows', 'brief', 'rampage', 'throwing', 'stuff', 'out', 'discovering', 'one', 'Zorg', 'personal', 'achievements', 'novel', 'brilliant', 'writer', 'should', 'focus', 'writing', 'Zorg', 'simply', 'off', 'personal', 'confidence.The', 'film', 'climb', 'crescendo', 'similar', 'way', 'orgasm', 'Evidently', 'something', 'wrong', 'Betty', 'Zorg', 'firm', 'next', 'ready', 'support', 'defend', 'necessary', 'only', 'thing', 'made', 'feel', 'good', 'life', 'not', 'willing', 'part', 'Betty', 'clings', 'affection', 'one', 'develop', 'film', 'where', 'become', 'very', 'comfortable', 'open', 'other', 'However', 'Betty', 'behavior', 'erratically', 'violent', 'whenever', 'pressured', 'helpless', 'increasingly', 'violent', 'eruptions', 'Betty', 'Zorg', 'what', 'abnormal', 'dangerous', 'do', 'everything', 'means', 'help', 'own', 'way.The', 'film', 'multidimensional', 'story', 'love', 'many', 'audience', 'members', 'might', 'focus', 'nudeness', 'film', 'nakedness', 'not', 'unique', 'incident', 'art', 'history', 'should', 'therefore', 'not', 'audience', 'Instead', 'audience', 'should', 'embrace', 'nudeness', 'normal', 'part', 'process', 'sexual', 'love', 'two', 'lovers', 'natural', 'nudeness', 'are', 'aspects', 'love', 'such', 'care', 'affection', 'support', 'joy', 'communication', 'occasional', 'disagreements', 'love', 'never', 'perfect', 'beginning', 'something', 'people', 'must', 'continuously', 'work', 'order', 'keep', 'intact', 'ups', 'downs', 'life.In', 'tragedy', 'Beineix', 'agony', 'joy', 'love', 'camera', 'caring', 'way', 'framing', 'scenes', 'care', 'how', 'characters', 'are', 'lined', 'up', 'scenes', 'well', 'mise-en-scene', 'additional', 'elements', 'enhance', 'themes', 'film', 'addition', 'camera', 'movement', 'editing', 'displays', 'moments', 'genius', 'example', 'brief', 'scene', 'Betty', 'standing', 'bridge', 'railway', 'where', 'train', 'coming', 'full', 'speed', 'train', 'camera', 'panning', 'right', 'scene', 'feeling', 'train', 'will', 'crash', 'even', 'obvious', 'train', 'will', 'safely', 'pass', 'Nonetheless', 'scene', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'Betty', 'very', 'symbolical', 'manner.The', 'combination', 'filmmaking', 'story', 'performance', 'actors', 'exceptional', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'times', 'film', 'lyrical', 'swiftly', 'being', 'able', 'move', 'towards', 'ominous', 'situation', 'where', 'high', 'levels', 'uncertainty', 'generate', 'anxiety', 'duality', 'humanity', 'been', 'gently', 'touched', 'film', 'not', 'thoroughly', 'explored', 'audience', 'personal', 'artistic', 'impression', 'what', 'truly', 'can', 'be']",N/A

228869,A1HCHMYMPO97CL,6300248674,M. J. Dirou,"[30, 30]","'Betty Blue', the movie that, as one reviewer put it,' sent shock waves rippling through arthouse cinemas everywhere' and introduced unforgettable 'Beatrice Dalle', a sort of modern day (though far wilder) 'Bardot', with an even more generous mouth. Who else but the French could pull off a film like this with such depth and style. An exploration of L'amour in all its beautiful and tragic complexities. Certainly to the faint hearted it may have seemed a little shocking. There is plenty of of full frontal nudity, both male and female (unlike the double standard in American cinema), and a very realistic sex scene to confront audiences in the very opening scene. But the erotica in this movie is really very natural with nothing perverse or kinky about it. It has an uninhibited earthiness about it that we have come to expect from French Movies. To others what may have seemed more shocking was the rather dark and depressing nature of the story, (if you haven't seen this movie don't go looking for a happy ending).Director 'Jean-Jacques Beineix', in an article I read, said something like: that he dedicated this film to a generation of French Cinema watchers, who still believed in perfect love but knew it couldn't last. This indeed seems to be the underlying theme of the film, that young love and passion can't last, something has to kill it, you want to preserve it in time like a beautiful photograph or picture, before it withers or tarnishes. The sense of impending doom that hangs over Betty and Zorg's passionate and beautiful love affair, is present from the beginning.The early part of the film is light and hopeful. When we initially meet 'Betty and Zorg'(who have recently began their love affair); she arrives, suitcase in hand, on his doorstep unexpectedly, where he lives in a sort of dreamlike,rundown, seaside shanty town, ready to move in. The scenes shot here are bathed in sunlight, clear blue skies and vibrant colours, to match the more hopeful mood. World weary 'Zorg', who seems content with his very basic existence, has his life quickly turned upside down by the younger free spirited and emotionally volatile, Betty. A beautiful raven haired, typically pouting and provocative French sex kittenish type. Betty soon discovers a secret collection of Zorg's writings, and becomes convinced he has the makings of a great author. The modest and more cynically realistic 'Zorg' is not so convinced. After being led by Betty to abandon their simple digs( in suitable reckless 'Betty' style) with the hope of finding publishing success and a better life in the city, Zorg and Betty embark on a rollercoaster journey that soon descends into much darker,gloomier territory. With each set back Betty becomes ever more disenchanted and emotionally unstable, and we discover, though the film never attempts to explain why, that she is infact a very disturbed young woman.The film 'Betty Blue' has a very artistic,lyrical and poetic quality about it. Visually beautiful with one of the most hauntingly exquisite musical scores I have ever heard. It is one of those foreign arthouse movies that inevitably has now received cult status. There are many aspects of this film which you could easlily find fault in. The story(and characters)seem completely irrational and unbelievable at times. But the artistic cinematography,the unforgettable music of 'Gabriel Yared' and moving performances of Jean- Hughes Anglade (as the tenderly patient and understanding, though often bewildered,'Zorg')and Dalle as (as the audacious,strikingly sexy but unstable 'Betty'),all make this film standout. It's a love story as moving in its tragedy as it is in its passion and beauty, you feel so completely the very true and deep love Zorg has for Betty especially, she drives him to the brink with her behaviour, yet in a way re-ignites a spark in him and passion that was buried, through her love and belief in him. I must admit it touches the hopeless romantic in me, a cinema enthusiast, who also wants to believe in true and 'perfect love', forever preserved in time and memory.",4,'L' amour in All it's Tragedy and Beauty,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,4085,"[""'Betty"", 'Blue', 'movie', 'one', 'reviewer', 'put', 'sent', 'shock', 'waves', 'rippling', 'arthouse', 'cinemas', 'everywhere', 'introduced', 'unforgettable', ""'Beatrice"", 'Dalle', 'sort', 'modern', 'day', 'far', 'wilder', 'even', 'more', 'generous', 'mouth', 'Who', 'else', 'French', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'film', 'such', 'depth', 'style', 'exploration', ""L'amour"", 'beautiful', 'tragic', 'complexities', 'Certainly', 'faint', 'hearted', 'may', 'have', 'seemed', 'little', 'shocking', 'plenty', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'male', 'female', 'double', 'standard', 'American', 'cinema', 'very', 'realistic', 'sex', 'scene', 'confront', 'audiences', 'very', 'opening', 'scene', 'erotica', 'movie', 'really', 'very', 'natural', 'nothing', 'perverse', 'kinky', 'uninhibited', 'earthiness', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'French', 'Movies', 'others', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'seemed', 'more', 'shocking', 'was', 'rather', 'dark', 'depressing', 'nature', 'story', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'looking', 'happy', 'ending', '.Director', ""'Jean-Jacques"", 'Beineix', 'article', 'read', 'said', 'something', 'dedicated', 'film', 'generation', 'French', 'Cinema', 'watchers', 'who', 'still', 'believed', 'perfect', 'love', 'knew', 'could', ""n't"", 'last', 'indeed', 'be', 'underlying', 'theme', 'film', 'young', 'love', 'passion', 'ca', ""n't"", 'last', 'something', 'kill', 'want', 'preserve', 'time', 'beautiful', 'photograph', 'picture', 'tarnishes', 'sense', 'impending', 'doom', 'Betty', 'Zorg', 'passionate', 'beautiful', 'love', 'affair', 'present', 'beginning.The', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'light', 'hopeful', 'When', 'initially', 'meet', ""'Betty"", 'Zorg', 'who', 'have', 'recently', 'began', 'love', 'affair', 'suitcase', 'hand', 'doorstep', 'unexpectedly', 'where', 'sort', 'dreamlike', 'rundown', 'seaside', 'shanty', 'town', 'ready', 'move', 'scenes', 'shot', 'here', 'are', 'bathed', 'sunlight', 'clear', 'blue', 'skies', 'vibrant', 'colours', 'match', 'more', 'hopeful', 'mood', 'World', 'weary', ""'Zorg"", 'who', 'content', 'very', 'basic', 'existence', 'life', 'quickly', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'younger', 'free', 'spirited', 'emotionally', 'volatile', 'Betty', 'beautiful', 'raven', 'haired', 'typically', 'pouting', 'provocative', 'French', 'sex', 'kittenish', 'type', 'Betty', 'soon', 'secret', 'collection', 'Zorg', 'writings', 'becomes', 'convinced', 'makings', 'great', 'author', 'modest', 'more', 'cynically', 'realistic', ""'Zorg"", 'not', 'so', 'convinced', 'being', 'led', 'Betty', 'abandon', 'simple', 'digs', 'suitable', 'reckless', 'style', 'hope', 'finding', 'publishing', 'success', 'better', 'life', 'city', 'Zorg', 'Betty', 'embark', 'rollercoaster', 'journey', 'soon', 'much', 'darker', 'gloomier', 'territory', 'set', 'back', 'Betty', 'ever', 'more', 'disenchanted', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'discover', 'film', 'never', 'explain', 'why', 'infact', 'very', 'disturbed', 'young', 'woman.The', 'film', 'Blue', 'very', 'artistic', 'lyrical', 'poetic', 'quality', 'Visually', 'beautiful', 'one', 'most', 'hauntingly', 'exquisite', 'musical', 'scores', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'one', 'foreign', 'arthouse', 'movies', 'inevitably', 'now', 'received', 'cult', 'status', 'are', 'many', 'aspects', 'film', 'could', 'easlily', 'find', 'fault', 'story', 'characters', 'seem', 'completely', 'irrational', 'unbelievable', 'times', 'artistic', 'cinematography', 'unforgettable', 'music', ""'Gabriel"", 'Yared', 'moving', 'performances', 'Jean-', 'Hughes', 'Anglade', 'tenderly', 'patient', 'understanding', 'though', 'often', 'bewildered', ""'Zorg"", 'Dalle', 'as', 'audacious', 'strikingly', 'sexy', 'unstable', ""'Betty"", 'make', 'film', 'standout', 'love', 'story', 'moving', 'tragedy', 'passion', 'beauty', 'feel', 'so', 'completely', 'very', 'true', 'deep', 'love', 'Zorg', 'Betty', 'especially', 'brink', 'behaviour', 'yet', 'way', 'spark', 'passion', 'was', 'buried', 'love', 'belief', 'must', 'admit', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'cinema', 'enthusiast', 'who', 'also', 'believe', 'true', ""'perfect"", 'love', 'forever', 'preserved', 'time', 'memory']",N/A

228871,A2ZTB8EDDR8RGW,6300248674,Penguin Egg,"[10, 11]","The characters in this film are so bursting with life that they are in danger of exploding. Psychologically, that is what Betty, the central character, played with panache by the beautiful Beatrice Dalle, does. Right from the beginning, it is obvious that she is neurotic and highly-strung; but as the film progresses, it becomes clear that she is schizophrenic: her excitable nature continually bursting into displays of violence. As she slowly descends into madness, it is no surprise that she eventually turns the violence on herself.A fault noted by others here is that there is no psychological explanation of her behaviour. This can also be said of other films where the main protagonist has descended into madness. Take Norman Bates in Psycho, for instance. The psychologist's explanation at the end of that film came over as so much psychobabble. The explanation was no explanation at all. Think of Catherine Deneuve's character in Roman Polanski's Repulsion. Despite the hints that her disturbance is rooted in her childhood, there is again no explanation. Yet, these are classic films. Beinex does not try to offer us an explanation. However, this does not affect the integrity of the film; after all, the characters dealing with Betty would not understand the cause of her disturbance. They would have to just deal with her erratic and violent behaviour as it arose.The film has a picaresque quality with the characters, not the plot, driving the story.

One would think the movie had been edited for Francoist Spain of the 1960s. Some prudish and arrogant censors decided to interfere with Jean-Jacques Beneix's creation and plastered it with pasties! The sorry result is obviously not what Jean-Jacques Beneix had in mind but what the South Korean government allows you to see.  So, there you are: a free citizen in a free country whose viewing freedom is limited by the diktats of a foreign government.This is no longer the director's cut but the CENSOR'S CUT! On and on, one has to suffer the censor's interferences: a third party that keeps intruding into your viewing experience to impose his values, to decide what's best for you. An absolutely unbearable experience.According to Wikipedia's article ""Film censorship in South Korea,"" such practices are routine official policy: ""In recent years, sexual scenes have been a major issue that pits filmmakers against Media Rating Board. Pubic hair and male or female genitalia is disallowed on the screen, unless they are digitally blurred.""THIS IS A MUTILATED MOVIE!

228873,A39IY0JU5JI69G,6300248674,"Promise ""promise""","[1, 1]","I'm a big fan of French films so I'll sit through anything and find things to love, that many people hate.  In this case I feel like the opposite.  I did like the photography, the great music, the male star, Jean-Hughes Anglade, and yes, the sex scenes.  About the sex scenes:  they are so natural and in keeping with the characters that I found them really sweet.  Also, as others have mentioned, the man is nude as well as the woman...which seems only fair.What failed to grab my affection was the character of Betty.  It could have been that I didn't much care for the actress, Beatrice Dalle, whom I don't find charming or beautiful or particularly interesting.  Men will probably like her a lot more than I did. Perhaps it's just the character as she is written:  a hot, uninhibited young girl, still a teenager at the beginning of the film, who has no compunction about either taking her clothers off or displaying her temper. I guess this free spirited type appeals to the imagination of a lot of men, but to me....not so much.  Other than being archetypically unconventional, there's nothing in her character to recommend her.She shows up on the doorstep of the guy she's had sex with for a week, when she lost her job and needed a place to stay. He said that he wasn't married, and didn't have any children, so he guessed it was ok.  Not a real good way to start a romance.  However he didn't have much else going on in his life and she was sexually available so he sort of got used to her.  She did give him plenty of signs that she wasn't all that stable....like throwing all his things out the window. But by that time apparently he was hooked.  He is such a patient, sweet guy (or loser, depending on how you look at it) that he doesn't complain.  Then she torches the place....forcing them to get outta there.  As they catch a ride on a pickup she exclaims to him from the cab (he is riding outside) that she loves him.  Ah, there's nothing  like seeing your home go up in flames to ignite passion.To her credit she discovers his unpublished novel, types it up and sends it out to publishers. She does believe that he is a genius and encourages him to take his writing seriously. They find refuge in her friend's house in Paris and then in another small town in the country, where another friend has offered them a job and a house. There are some sweet and tender moments between them but their good times are mostly of the manic variety, fueled by drink.  Her anger erupts in some ugly ways, as when she stabs a woman with a fork in the restaurant where they have been given jobs by their friend. When that friend loses his mother everyone is sympathetic except Betty, who laughs. I guess this is why I fail to like Betty....not only is she crazy, she is not-very-nice crazy.  I have been around a fair amount of mentally ill people, having worked in a mental hospital and many of them are beautiful souls who really capture your hearts, even when they do sick things.  But Betty just seems self-absorbed and I found myself wishing that the inevitable end would come quickly.I kept pulling for poor Zorg, the writer, as Betty's behavior drove him into more and more distress.  Then I had to remind myself that he must have had his own (bad) reasons for falling for such a disturbed woman.  Could he have loved a healthy woman or does he need someone this far gone on whom to hitch his own romantic star?  Well, as the film says it, Betty brought him the great gift of returning to his writing....and his next book is dedicated to her.  I guess if you believe in this kind of romance, you'll love this film.
