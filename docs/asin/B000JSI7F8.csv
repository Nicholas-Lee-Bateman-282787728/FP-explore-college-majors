1029157,A9Y947FCJZPVL,B000JSI7F8,Arcadio Bolaos,"[1, 1]","Bernard Alapetite & Cyril Legann's film is allocated in two distinct moments: the present in which we catch a glimpse on young S&eacute;bastien's life, and the past, which sets the basis for everything he is experiencing now.Why is it the past so important for most of us? Surely it's not only because we tend to have a glorified memory of years gone by. The past, after all, can sometimes fully define us if we manage to comprehend it. In the present, S&eacute;bastien is going to gay bars and hooking up with guys, but in the past only one boy occupied his every thought: his best friend Romain.When S&eacute;bastien is alone, he draws Romain's body in a piece of paper. Here, the image is clearly the ideal and thus the unobtainable object. One moment exemplifies this assertion perfectly: when the two boys are lying in bed together, watching TV, the muffled sound of pornography coming from the background arouses Romain enough for him to fondle himself knowing that his friend is right there; as he proceeds to go to the bathroom S&eacute;bastien follows him and watches carefully how his friend masturbates frenetically. Except that he doesn't see his friend's facial expressions of joy, but rather his image reflected in the bathroom's mirror.Why is the mirror important? For Jacques Lacan a relationship between the specular and the non-specular exists. The individual does not have direct access to the real of his body, it's only through the virtual image in the mirror plane that one gains such access. Although this indicates the necessary interposition of the Other, the Other of language. When S&eacute;bastien is looking at himself during the first minutes of the movie, his only concern is his physical appearance, and it should rightly be so as he intends to expose himself to the gaze of the other. This paradigmatic scheme is the foundation of narcissism, in which one's psychic energies are invested in one's own image thus making it lovable (for others).But is the protagonist narcissistic? Every time S&eacute;bastien practices sex with other men he let his himself being penetrated; thus complying with what most people would label a ""passive"" position. There is, however, one instance in which he plays a most active role, and that is when he spends the night at Romain's place, and starts touching him and caressing him.If S&eacute;bastien is truly narcissistic then the recognition placed upon himself by others would be undermined by a certain 'deceptiveness', because narcissism tends to mask the fact that I perceive myself from the Other's point of view. When Sebastian spies on his friend, draws him or thinks of him, he is indeed circumscribing himself into the sphere of the other's desire; and should he come to the conclusion that the other is no longer there to support him, then the first steps towards narcissism will be taken.",4,Sexuality and self-discovery,1318032000,"10 8, 2011",2011,2866,"['Bernard', 'Alapetite', 'Cyril', 'Legann', 'film', 'allocated', 'two', 'distinct', 'moments', 'present', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'young', 'S', 'eacute', 'bastien', 'life', 'past', 'basis', 'everything', 'experiencing', 'now.Why', 'past', 'so', 'important', 'most', 'Surely', 'not', 'only', 'tend', 'have', 'glorified', 'memory', 'years', 'gone', 'past', 'can', 'sometimes', 'fully', 'define', 'manage', 'comprehend', 'present', 'S', 'eacute', 'bastien', 'going', 'gay', 'bars', 'hooking', 'up', 'guys', 'past', 'only', 'one', 'boy', 'occupied', 'thought', 'best', 'friend', 'Romain.When', 'S', 'eacute', 'alone', 'Romain', 'body', 'piece', 'paper', 'Here', 'image', 'clearly', 'ideal', 'thus', 'unobtainable', 'object', 'One', 'moment', 'assertion', 'perfectly', 'when', 'two', 'boys', 'are', 'lying', 'bed', 'together', 'watching', 'TV', 'muffled', 'sound', 'pornography', 'coming', 'background', 'Romain', 'enough', 'fondle', 'knowing', 'friend', 'right', 'there', 'go', 'bathroom', 'S', 'eacute', 'watches', 'carefully', 'how', 'friend', 'frenetically', ""n't"", 'see', 'friend', 'facial', 'expressions', 'joy', 'rather', 'image', 'reflected', 'bathroom', 'mirror.Why', 'mirror', 'important', 'Jacques', 'Lacan', 'relationship', 'specular', 'non-specular', 'exists', 'individual', 'not', 'have', 'direct', 'access', 'real', 'body', 'only', 'virtual', 'image', 'mirror', 'plane', 'one', 'gains', 'such', 'access', 'necessary', 'interposition', 'Other', 'Other', 'language', 'When', 'S', 'eacute', 'bastien', 'looking', 'first', 'minutes', 'movie', 'only', 'concern', 'physical', 'appearance', 'should', 'rightly', 'be', 'so', 'expose', 'gaze', 'other', 'paradigmatic', 'scheme', 'foundation', 'narcissism', 'one', 'psychic', 'energies', 'are', 'invested', 'one', 'own', 'image', 'thus', 'making', 'lovable', 'others', '.But', 'protagonist', 'narcissistic', 'time', 'S', 'eacute', 'practices', 'sex', 'other', 'men', 'let', 'being', 'penetrated', 'thus', 'complying', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'label', 'passive', 'position', 'however', 'one', 'instance', 'most', 'active', 'role', 'when', 'night', 'Romain', 'place', 'touching', 'caressing', 'him.If', 'S', 'eacute', 'bastien', 'truly', 'narcissistic', 'then', 'recognition', 'placed', 'others', 'would', 'be', 'undermined', 'certain', ""'deceptiveness"", 'narcissism', 'mask', 'fact', 'perceive', 'Other', 'point', 'view', 'When', 'Sebastian', 'spies', 'friend', 'thinks', 'indeed', 'circumscribing', 'sphere', 'other', 'desire', 'should', 'come', 'conclusion', 'other', 'longer', 'support', 'then', 'first', 'steps', 'towards', 'narcissism', 'will', 'be', 'taken']",Like a Brother
1029158,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000JSI7F8,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[57, 61]","Sebastian is a 19 year old French boy living in a small town, who has unrequitted longings for Romain, who has been ""Like A Brother (Comme un fr&egrave;re)"" (2005) to him for many years.  Jealous of Romain's developing relationship with a girl, Sebastian is torn between comforting his friend and jumping for joy when she goes off with someone else.  While Romain is outwardly affectionate toward Sebastian, he senses his friend is gay and isn't surprised when Sebastian leaves their province to go to Paris, where he lives with his father (after coming out to him) and begins to explore his gay feelings in the club scene there.  Those first few months are tough for Sebastian (who now calls himself Zack, after a character on an American TV show), who keeps thinking back to his best times with Romain.  After a disappointing first sexual experience with someone who was just looking for a one night stand, Zack eventually meets Bruno, with whom he begins a tentative relationship.  Then he gets a call: Romain is in town and wants to see him.Beautifully photographed, with excellent production quality, and very attractive twink-ish actors in the two lead roles.  It's short (only 55 minutes) and a little confusing, with most of the story told in abrupt flashbacks that alternate between a year ago and just a few weeks ago.  In French with English subtitles (which cannot be turned off), DVD includes ""making of"" feature with writer, director and actors.

1029160,A4UFWKMQ2DPKJ,B000JSI7F8,"Christoff ""SegredoAmazonico""","[1, 1]","The main theme of this film centers around the ambiguity between Sebastien & Romain - both approximately 19 years old.  Sebastien prefers guys over girls, and he is very much attracted to more than mere platonic friendship with his ""best buddy"" Romain who is not completely emotionally cold towards him; in fact the viewer sees several incidents showing their closeness, including kissing and almost more............... It is the ""more"" which Seb longs for with Romain.However, Sophie is the object of Romain's affection, and her friend Marine is keen to get something going with Sebastien.  These four hang out together often.  Sophie organizes a party for Seb's upcoming birthday about which he is not excited because he informs them that he has no friends beyond this quartet.  During the party, he notices that while Romain is dancing by himself (perhaps a little intoxicated, since he nearly knocked over the food table), Sophie is flirting behind his back with David, who tells her that she needs a real man like him, because ""those two (Romain & Sebastien) suck more than lollipops"".Sebastien decides to leave La Baule, the seaside town where he goes to school, for Paris where he hopes to experience deeper gay connections.  He leaves suddenly without saying good-bye to Romain (or the girls).  Once in Paris he calls his father, a butcher, who invites him over.  He informs his dad right off the bat that he is gay, which his dad had suspected, but confirms that he loves him anyway, and offers Sebastien the option to move in with him - which Seb accepts.Also upon arriving in Paris, Sebastien changes his name to Zack, based on the first tv character he'd had a crush on as a young boy.  He also buys a magazine and responds to a sex ad telling the advertiser over the phone that he wants to get laid tonight.  He hooks up with Laurent later, and when he informs Zack after sex that he shouldn't fall asleep in his bed, because he cannot stay over, since he doesn't want a relationship, Zack realizes that he longs for something more than mere sexual relief.In the days following, Zack visits gay shops & clubs, and meets Bruno.  Their encounter leads to a relationship of which we do not see a whole lot during the 55 minutes of running time of this really well made movie.While intimate with Bruno on another occasion, his cell phone rings, and Zack chooses to answer.  This is the second time that a telephone call interrupts an intimate moment in the film.  It is Romain calling to inform him that he is on a short study course in Paris and would like to see him.  They arrange to meet in a park the next day.  Zack had moved on with his life.  He tells Romain that he (Zack) has changed a lot, but adds that Romain doesn't appear to have changed at all.  Romain is nonetheless keen to tell him that he (Zack) was right about Sophie not being the right girl for him; she left him for David after the party, and Romain adds that if his recent studies in Paris go well, he may relocate here also. He also asks Zack if he has any new friends & whether he has a boyfriend, which Zack confirms.The film is about to end soon, and I won't give out any more details by spoiling your discovery.This is by far the shortest full length film in my personal dvd collection, but I enjoy it more with every viewing - 4 times so far.  It is not shown in a linear, chronological time line.  It is compiled of several flashbacks between Zack's life in La Baule versus now in Paris.  I don't normally care for this technique, but it is very functional in this film.  I do recommend watching the discussion by the writers, directors and some actors in the Special Features section.  It is quite insightful.  I give this movie 4.5 stars, (versus 5) because there are really top notch movies in this genre, like Brokeback Mountain, A Single Man, From Beginning to End, to name just a few.  For a longer list of other great gay movies, see my review for the film ""Harvest"" (also here on amazon.com).",5,I Like This Movie More With Every Viewing,1331078400,"03 7, 2012",2012,3991,"['main', 'theme', 'film', 'centers', 'ambiguity', 'Sebastien', 'Romain', 'approximately', '19', 'years', 'old', 'Sebastien', 'prefers', 'guys', 'girls', 'very', 'much', 'attracted', 'more', 'mere', 'platonic', 'friendship', 'best', 'buddy', 'Romain', 'who', 'not', 'completely', 'emotionally', 'cold', 'towards', 'fact', 'viewer', 'sees', 'several', 'incidents', 'showing', 'closeness', 'including', 'kissing', 'almost', 'more', 'more', 'Seb', 'longs', 'Romain.However', 'Sophie', 'object', 'Romain', 'affection', 'friend', 'Marine', 'keen', 'get', 'something', 'going', 'Sebastien', 'four', 'hang', 'together', 'often', 'Sophie', 'party', 'Seb', 'upcoming', 'birthday', 'not', 'excited', 'friends', 'quartet', 'party', 'Romain', 'dancing', 'perhaps', 'little', 'intoxicated', 'nearly', 'knocked', 'food', 'table', 'Sophie', 'flirting', 'back', 'David', 'who', 'real', 'man', 'two', 'Romain', 'Sebastien', 'suck', 'more', 'lollipops', '.Sebastien', 'decides', 'leave', 'La', 'Baule', 'seaside', 'town', 'where', 'school', 'Paris', 'where', 'experience', 'deeper', 'gay', 'connections', 'suddenly', 'saying', 'good-bye', 'Romain', 'girls', 'Once', 'Paris', 'father', 'butcher', 'who', 'over', 'dad', 'right', 'bat', 'gay', 'dad', 'had', 'suspected', 'anyway', 'Sebastien', 'option', 'move', 'Seb', 'arriving', 'Paris', 'Sebastien', 'name', 'Zack', 'based', 'first', 'tv', 'character', ""'d"", 'had', 'crush', 'young', 'boy', 'also', 'magazine', 'sex', 'ad', 'telling', 'advertiser', 'phone', 'get', 'laid', 'tonight', 'up', 'Laurent', 'later', 'when', 'Zack', 'sex', 'should', ""n't"", 'fall', 'asleep', 'bed', 'can', 'not', 'stay', ""n't"", 'want', 'relationship', 'Zack', 'something', 'more', 'mere', 'sexual', 'relief.In', 'days', 'following', 'Zack', 'gay', 'shops', 'clubs', 'meets', 'Bruno', 'encounter', 'relationship', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'whole', 'lot', '55', 'minutes', 'running', 'time', 'really', 'well', 'made', 'movie.While', 'intimate', 'Bruno', 'occasion', 'cell', 'phone', 'rings', 'Zack', 'answer', 'second', 'time', 'telephone', 'call', 'intimate', 'moment', 'film', 'Romain', 'calling', 'inform', 'short', 'study', 'course', 'Paris', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'arrange', 'meet', 'park', 'next', 'day', 'Zack', 'had', 'moved', 'life', 'Zack', 'changed', 'lot', 'Romain', ""n't"", 'appear', 'have', 'changed', 'Romain', 'nonetheless', 'keen', 'tell', 'Zack', 'was', 'right', 'Sophie', 'not', 'being', 'right', 'girl', 'left', 'David', 'party', 'Romain', 'recent', 'studies', 'Paris', 'go', 'well', 'may', 'relocate', 'here', 'also', 'also', 'Zack', 'new', 'friends', 'boyfriend', 'Zack', 'confirms.The', 'film', 'end', 'soon', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'out', 'more', 'details', 'spoiling', 'discovery.This', 'far', 'shortest', 'full', 'length', 'film', 'personal', 'dvd', 'collection', 'enjoy', 'more', 'viewing', '4', 'times', 'so', 'far', 'not', 'shown', 'linear', 'chronological', 'time', 'line', 'compiled', 'several', 'flashbacks', 'Zack', 'life', 'La', 'Baule', 'versus', 'now', 'Paris', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'care', 'technique', 'very', 'functional', 'film', 'do', 'recommend', 'watching', 'discussion', 'writers', 'directors', 'actors', 'Special', 'Features', 'section', 'quite', 'insightful', 'give', 'movie', '4.5', 'stars', '5', 'are', 'really', 'top', 'notch', 'movies', 'genre', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'A', 'Single', 'Man', 'Beginning', 'End', 'name', 'just', 'few', 'longer', 'list', 'other', 'great', 'gay', 'movies', 'see', 'review', 'film', 'Harvest', 'also', 'here', 'amazon.com']",Like a Brother

1029163,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000JSI7F8,Grady Harp,"[11, 12]","'Comme un fr&egrave;re' (Like a Brother) is a brief film by writers and directors Bernard Alapetite and Cyril Legann that succinctly examines the development of identity of a young lad over a period of less than a year.  The technique of telling the story of the coming of sexual age of a boy is one that may confuse some viewers - the present is combined with the past in a patchwork manner, the only key that the past is the subject is the use of near monochrome film color that successfully suggests the blur that past events now faded affect the senses - becomes one of the more unique aspects of this little French film.The story opens in Paris where young S&eacute;bastien/AKA Zack (Benot Deli&egrave;re) sits in a caf&eacute; with his current boyfriend Bruno (Johnny Amaro) and lets it be known that it is his birthday.  Bruno's questioning as to why S&eacute;bastien is not in a celebratory mood begins flashbacks of a year ago when S&eacute;bastien lived in the small coastal town of La Baule where he doted on his best friend Romain (Thibault Boucaux). Despite Romain's devotion and physical closeness to S&eacute;bastien, Romain is in love with Sophie (Amandine Maugy) whose best friend Marine (Adeline Ishiomin) is trying to attract the love interest of S&eacute;bastien.  The four are close, but something is missing: S&eacute;bastien loves Romain and while the two have some beautifully tender moments together, Romain is not the gay boy S&eacute;bastien needs.S&eacute;bastien leaves his provincial town for Paris, connects with his father (Michel Derville) and confides his true identity as a gay young man.  His father is warmly supportive and suggests S&eacute;bastien move in with him.  S&eacute;bastien (now called 'Zack') begins to visit clubs and eventually is absorbed into the gay life, yet he still dreams of Romain.  After months pass and Zack is in a comfortable relationship (Patrick Esilva), Romain comes to Paris and the two now young men meet in a park - but where will this new reunion lead?The actors are for the most part very fine - especially Thibault Boucaux and Adeline Ishiomin - and the sensual aspects of the story are well captured with restraint.  With a running time of only 55 minutes the story flies past the eyes much in the way memories bounce in the psyche and it is this manner that makes the story fresh.  There should be more to come from the creators and certainly from some of the fine new actors in this film. In French with English subtitles.

Cute-D/W's scene lighting for sex scenes is catastrophic, particularly to gay viewers (who else would there be?).

In fact, they can be quite enjoyable.  But when a very short film rambles on for fifty-five minutes with a paper-thin plot featuring shallow characters spouting inane dialogue and then suddenly, in the middle of a conversation, boom! the end credits start rolling, then you wonder, ""What the heck was that all about?""  Such is the case with ""Like a Brother"" (""Comme un Fr&egrave;re"").In the making-of documentary, which oddly enough lasts more than half as long as the movie itself (a bad sign), the directors talk about how memories don't occur in linear fashion but rather in jumbled bits and pieces, and that there are no neat resolutions to life's problems, and that crises in real life are not always dramatic (what is life-changing for one may be insignificant for  another).  All of which are true.  But they don't really say much about the movie itself.  Or maybe I missed something because of the inadequate subtitles.  (The folks being interviewed talk for fifteen or twenty seconds and one brief line of subtitles appears.)The nonlinear nature of the movie is quite confusing.  (Wait a sec, wasn't our protagonist alone in Paris a minute ago?  Now he's romping on the beach with the best friend he left behind.  I didn't know Paris was on the ocean.  It isn't?  Then we must be back in the past.  But when and why?)  Nonlinear films often require a second viewing to better understand what's happening, but I can't imagine ever being interested enough to watch this one again, even though it would take less than an hour to do so.Yeah, there are cute actors and a couple of steamy scenes, and for some people that's enough.

The one exception to this is a scene where Roman (or Romain, as the sub-titler spelled it) pleads with Zack/Sebastien to not leave him... there's a sense of genuine longing between the young men.This is a story that could have been told so much better.  Confusing flashbacks and undeveloped relationships afforded the writers and directors much more opportunity to tell a much deeper and more meaningful story than they did.  I'll leave it the other reviewers who've given you a plot synopsis to tell the story, but suffice it to say that it was a disappointment on many levels.First, whoever did the subtitles is largely unable to construct meaningful sentences in English.  The purpose for subtitles is to hear the dialogue and then, using the vernacular in the target language, tell the story of what's going on in the dialogue.  Whoever did these subtitles merely took the French words and translated them to English, which if you've ever spoken French, you'll know that the grammar is not the same as English, so the subtitles fail to tell the entire story of what's going on between the characters.Secondly, someone should actually instruct the filmmakers in the use of lighting.  The interior scenes were in desparate need of a spot or floodlight here and there.  I'm all for lighting a scene to create a mood, but barely characters who are barely visible within the darkness is unacceptable.Thirdly, I'm disappointed that a coming out movie from France would have no nudity.  A few bare bottoms is more of what I would expect from Hollywood or even worse, London... the French don't usually have such inhibitions, and the pans to the wall, or the floor, or just to darkness rather than showing the sex scenes really detracts from the film.All in all, a disappointment.
