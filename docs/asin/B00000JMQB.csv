Although, Percy is just the same old engine again; whining and complaining about all the work he has and feels that he is ""put upon"" with so much work. But let's put Percy aside shall we and focuse on the hilarious stories on here:Toby And The Flood 5/5:It's a stormy day on the Island of Sodor and Toby is miserable because of all the dark clouds. He is sent on patrol to see how bad the storm really is and finds out that the dam is breaking so he hurries back to warn everyone. But on his way, while crossing a bridge, the dam collapses and sends Toby down stream. Can he make it to safety in time before the river takes him down the waterfall?Put Upon Percy 4/5:Percy is whining and complaining that he is being put upon with work. Thomas pays no attention to him and tells him that he's just a silly engine. But when there is an avalanche at the quarry, will Percy be able to save himself and his driver in time?Horrid Lorry 4.5/5:Cranky tells the engines that they are too slow and delay the ships at the docks. He says that a lorry should take over their jobs. The engines are furious and hope that a lorry does not come, but one does, along with two other ones. The lorries are very rude to the engines and take over their work. Pretty soon there is no work left for Toby. Will the lorries continue this madness? Find out in this story.Bye George! 5/5:George just can't stand railways. One day, he is ripping up an old railway when Thomas goes by with some freight cars. George starts saying how bad railways are but Thomas can't hear him. George thinks that Thomas is ignoring him and this makes him mad. He soon ends up causing trouble.Something In The Air 5/5:Thomas is a bit late to the docks with Henry's load for The Flying Kipper. Thomas tries to warn Henry that there is danger on the rails but Henry doesn't listen. And because of that, he ends up swimming with the fish.Oliver's Find 3.5/5:Oliver has an accident with some freight cars, so Sir Topham Hatt has him run the mail train for a while. One night, Oliver gets lost and Sir Topham Hatt gets worried. When he finally finds Oliver, he finds something else very interesting.""Accidents Will Happen""(Music Video) 6/5:A fun and catchy song that is a great addition to this video, since it talks about accidents.I'd recommend this Thomas video. It is funny and even sad at time but it will provide lots of entertainment to the whole family.",5,A entertaining Thomas video!,1099958400,"11 9, 2004",2004,2596,"['Thomas', 'video', 'whole', 'bunch', 'crash', 'sequences', 'time', 'see', 'accident', 'Thomas', 'start', 'laughing', 'so', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'much', 'laughed', 'watching', 'video', 'Percy', 'just', 'same', 'old', 'engine', 'again', 'whining', 'complaining', 'work', 'feels', 'put', 'so', 'much', 'work', 'let', 'put', 'Percy', 'aside', 'shall', 'focuse', 'hilarious', 'stories', 'here', 'Toby', 'Flood', '5/5', 'stormy', 'day', 'Island', 'Sodor', 'Toby', 'miserable', 'dark', 'clouds', 'sent', 'patrol', 'see', 'how', 'bad', 'storm', 'really', 'out', 'dam', 'breaking', 'so', 'back', 'warn', 'everyone', 'way', 'crossing', 'bridge', 'dam', 'collapses', 'Toby', 'down', 'stream', 'Can', 'make', 'safety', 'time', 'river', 'down', 'waterfall', 'Put', 'Upon', 'Percy', '4/5', 'Percy', 'whining', 'complaining', 'being', 'put', 'work', 'Thomas', 'attention', 'just', 'silly', 'engine', 'when', 'avalanche', 'quarry', 'will', 'Percy', 'be', 'able', 'save', 'driver', 'time', 'Horrid', 'Lorry', '4.5/5', 'Cranky', 'engines', 'are', 'too', 'slow', 'delay', 'ships', 'docks', 'lorry', 'should', 'take', 'over', 'jobs', 'engines', 'are', 'furious', 'hope', 'lorry', 'not', 'come', 'one', 'two', 'other', 'ones', 'lorries', 'are', 'very', 'rude', 'engines', 'take', 'over', 'work', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'work', 'left', 'Toby', 'Will', 'lorries', 'continue', 'madness', 'Find', 'out', 'story.Bye', 'George', '5/5', 'George', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'railways', 'One', 'day', 'ripping', 'up', 'old', 'railway', 'when', 'Thomas', 'freight', 'cars', 'George', 'saying', 'how', 'bad', 'railways', 'are', 'Thomas', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'George', 'Thomas', 'ignoring', 'mad', 'soon', 'up', 'causing', 'trouble.Something', 'Air', '5/5', 'Thomas', 'bit', 'late', 'docks', 'Henry', 'load', 'Flying', 'Kipper', 'Thomas', 'warn', 'Henry', 'danger', 'rails', 'Henry', ""n't"", 'listen', 'up', 'swimming', 'fish.Oliver', 'Find', '3.5/5', 'Oliver', 'accident', 'freight', 'cars', 'so', 'Sir', 'Topham', 'Hatt', 'run', 'mail', 'train', 'while', 'One', 'night', 'Oliver', 'lost', 'Sir', 'Topham', 'Hatt', 'worried', 'When', 'finally', 'Oliver', 'something', 'else', 'very', 'interesting', 'Accidents', 'Will', 'Happen', 'Music', 'Video', '6/5', 'fun', 'catchy', 'song', 'great', 'addition', 'video', 'accidents.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Thomas', 'video', 'funny', 'even', 'sad', 'time', 'will', 'provide', 'lots', 'entertainment', 'whole', 'family']","Thomas The Tank Engine and Friends - Races, Rescues & Runaways VHS"

506687,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B00000JMQB,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[4, 5]","In this installment of Thomas and Friends, Alec Baldwin takes viewers on yet another set of Thomas adventures.  My son is a huge fan of Thomas, and we watch his videos almost every day.  This tape in particular has become one of his favorites.  The first story especially grabs his attention due to the dam breaking during the flood, Toby floating helplessly past the sign that says ""Beware the Waterfall"", which my son has memorized by now, and the heroic rescue by Harold the helicopter. He also enjoys the story of the Lorries; three spunky little trucks which are supposed to replace the engines, but in the end its the Lorries who can't perform their work.As with other Thomas videos, this is just the right lenght to hold my son's interest without him becoming distracted.  The stories are bright and cheerful, and Alec Baldwin makes an excellent narrator.  I highly recommend the Thomas video series.  Buy one or several of this series and enjoy them with your children.

In my Thomas listmania I called Percy a whiner. Well I think he know is. In this one and then in Percy's Chocalte Crunch he whines about hard work. I mean some of them complain but he whines. That's just plain annoying. The best episode one this tape was probably the Lorry one and i'd like to point out the fact that Butch does not have a face. Bye George was just plain stupid. Oliver was good in his episode and I wish he'd have more of those. This tape is ok and it would be good for Thomas fans to have.
