In America..we do the same think on Facebook (not me, I don't even have a Facebook page)..what do we have for dinner..went to the store for candy etc etc.  This film captures everyday detail and if that bothers you, you aren't likely to be into this film much.  That being said though, I agree with all the reviews because everybody myself including notes that the lead actress is incredible..she is a great actress and extremely easy on the eyes!!  The film is good enough to me that when the credits suddenl and without warning came up I thought it ended too soon and would have liked it to carry on further with what happened in her life.  The scene at the close with the woman, baby and her mother was really good.  I give it four stars mainly because I admire the lead character really having to carry out the whole thing and pulling it off swimmingly!!  If this same lead actress were given a great script she'd be as famous as Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct!!  And I hope one day French filmmakers become aware that smoking is not glamorous anymore; in fact it kills and is particularly deadly to do while pregnant, drinking, too, and this woman while pregnant does both throughout the film!",4,Gotta love the French for singling out every detail,1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,1287,"['am', 'starting', 'get', 'used', 'fact', 'French', 'films', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'LOVE', 'EVERYDAY', 'DETAIL', 'America..we', 'do', 'same', 'think', 'Facebook', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'Facebook', 'page', 'do', 'have', 'dinner..went', 'store', 'candy', 'etc', 'etc', 'film', 'everyday', 'detail', 'are', ""n't"", 'likely', 'be', 'film', 'much', 'being', 'said', 'agree', 'reviews', 'everybody', 'including', 'notes', 'lead', 'actress', 'incredible..she', 'great', 'actress', 'extremely', 'easy', 'eyes', 'film', 'good', 'enough', 'when', 'credits', 'suddenl', 'warning', 'came', 'up', 'thought', 'ended', 'too', 'soon', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'carry', 'further', 'what', 'happened', 'life', 'scene', 'close', 'woman', 'baby', 'mother', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'mainly', 'admire', 'lead', 'character', 'really', 'having', 'carry', 'out', 'whole', 'thing', 'pulling', 'off', 'swimmingly', 'same', 'lead', 'actress', 'were', 'given', 'great', 'script', ""'d"", 'be', 'as', 'famous', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'French', 'filmmakers', 'become', 'aware', 'smoking', 'not', 'glamorous', 'anymore', 'fact', 'particularly', 'deadly', 'do', 'pregnant', 'drinking', 'too', 'woman', 'pregnant', 'film']",N/A

185960,A11GVIS6AXDEAX,1572521376,James Chong,"[5, 7]","&quot;La Fille seule&quot; is an absolute gem of a film that is particularly fascinating because its structural simplicity belies a complex, multi-layered character study. And the subject of writer/director  Jacquot's scrutiny is a headstrong, independent young woman who, while  acknowledging her vulnerability in the face of several personal crises,  refuses to sit idly by and play the victim. The camera utterly adores  actress Virginie Ledoyen (who portrays Valerie with raw vibrance), which is  perhaps why there is never a dull moment in a film that was shot in real  time so that viewers could get a glimpse of even the most trivial of daily  tasks that Valerie undertakes. What is also interesting is Jacquot's  low-keyed exploration of sexual harassment in the workplace and of how  brief, chance encounters with strangers can have long-term effects on our  personal attitudes and perceptions.",5,A raw slice of life,956534400,"04 24, 2000",2000,903,"['quot', 'La', 'Fille', 'seule', 'quot', 'absolute', 'gem', 'film', 'particularly', 'fascinating', 'structural', 'simplicity', 'complex', 'multi-layered', 'character', 'study', 'subject', 'writer/director', 'Jacquot', 'scrutiny', 'headstrong', 'independent', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'acknowledging', 'vulnerability', 'face', 'several', 'personal', 'crises', 'sit', 'idly', 'play', 'victim', 'camera', 'utterly', 'adores', 'actress', 'Virginie', 'Ledoyen', 'who', 'Valerie', 'raw', 'vibrance', 'perhaps', 'why', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'real', 'time', 'viewers', 'could', 'get', 'glimpse', 'even', 'most', 'trivial', 'daily', 'tasks', 'Valerie', 'undertakes', 'What', 'also', 'interesting', 'Jacquot', 'low-keyed', 'exploration', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'workplace', 'how', 'brief', 'chance', 'encounters', 'strangers', 'can', 'have', 'long-term', 'effects', 'personal', 'attitudes', 'perceptions']",N/A

But the movie is very, very unique (filmed in real time except for a jump  ahead to two years later) and exceedlingly well-filmed.  Virginie is a  fabulous actress (and very brave to be filmed in such a manner), and she  portrays the problem of wanting to be a single, independent woman and  mother in France.  Her portrayal is very important to contemporary French  society, and she lives up to the task.

Virginie Ledoyen is on the screen for the whole movie, often by herself in her own thoughts-but you never tire of watching her. This is partly because  she is so pretty, and partly because she is so alive on screen. But mostly  it is because she is a terrific actress, she goes from flirting to fury in  the space of a breath. Finally, you have to credit the director,Benoit  Jacquot, with developing a story and a rhythm which allowed Virginie to  explore what being a single girl can mean.
