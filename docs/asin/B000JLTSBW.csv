Instead, the film turns into Marta's airing of her complaints about her mother, father, and ex-husband.  She even lamented that she got her picture in National Geographic and sent it to her father as an ""in your face"" gesture but he died 2 days before the issue arrived at his door.Instead of showing Marta as a brilliant independent artist, she comes across as an eccentric who lives in a ghost town in the desert because she doesn't get along well with others.  She even talks about how she likes animals better than people and has corralled burros from Death Valley to keep the National Park Service from killing them. (The burros -- brought there in the early 20th century by miners -- are not native to Death Valley and interfere with the habitat of the native bighorn sheep.)If you watch this video, do it for the travelogue of Death Valley Junction and to see Marta's mural art and dancing, but skip through the interviews.

The story of Marta Becket and how she transformed a dilapidated opera house in Death Valley into a showcase for her splendid murals, witty dance performances and delightful choreography is deeply inspiring. As a painter myself I found her sense of purpose, productivity and myriad talents both awe-inspiring and humbling. And in addition to all her creative output, she finds time to rescue and nurture cats, wild burros, and other animals. Her comments on the difficulty of balancing her career and an intimate relationship will, I suspect, resonate with many artists, particularly women. And, like many artists, she was in part motivated by the desire to prove herself to her hyper-critical father; fortunately, one sees very much how one supportive parent (her mother) can make all the difference. One thing I particularly admired about her and hope to incorporate into my psyche is her ability to keep the past present in her mind and heart; not to mourn it but to simply acknowledge that it is part of who she is.",5,Must-see for artists,1302566400,"04 12, 2011",2011,1101,"['stumbled', 'little', 'gem', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'story', 'Marta', 'Becket', 'how', 'transformed', 'dilapidated', 'opera', 'house', 'Death', 'Valley', 'showcase', 'splendid', 'murals', 'witty', 'dance', 'performances', 'delightful', 'choreography', 'deeply', 'inspiring', 'painter', 'found', 'sense', 'purpose', 'productivity', 'myriad', 'talents', 'awe-inspiring', 'humbling', 'addition', 'creative', 'output', 'time', 'rescue', 'nurture', 'cats', 'wild', 'burros', 'other', 'animals', 'comments', 'difficulty', 'balancing', 'career', 'intimate', 'relationship', 'will', 'suspect', 'resonate', 'many', 'artists', 'particularly', 'women', 'many', 'artists', 'was', 'part', 'motivated', 'desire', 'prove', 'hyper-critical', 'father', 'fortunately', 'one', 'very', 'much', 'how', 'one', 'supportive', 'parent', 'mother', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'One', 'thing', 'particularly', 'admired', 'hope', 'incorporate', 'psyche', 'ability', 'keep', 'past', 'present', 'mind', 'heart', 'not', 'mourn', 'simply', 'acknowledge', 'part', 'who']",N/A

Cook ""Scabboy""","[1, 1]","I spent some time in Shoshone, California and saw the sign &#34;Death Valley Junction&#34; pointing down 127 and always though that the name was great and I would love to visit. I then saw a documentary of the Manson Family called Inside the Manson Gang, and some of the gang were pulled over by the Shoshone sheriff right next to that sign and it again made me interested in that town.So, we planned a trip through Death Valley and planned a stay at the Amargosa Hotel in Death Valley Junction. I read up on the history of Marta Becket and became very excited to stay here.Sadly, when we drove through Marta was not performing and this was on the tail end of two deceitful and greedy &#34;hotel managers&#34; swindling Marta and allowing her to suffer medically. it seemed like a grim time for the Amergosa Opera House and Hotel. Knowing all of this, it made me a bit sad to stop by... the place was really lacking any energy. The cafe was closed, the office was basically closed, and we saw but one person.Thankfully things have gotten better. I digress.When we stopped by, we were allowed to view this movie in the dining hall, with the other visitor that day, and it blew us away.Not only is this documentary beautifully done, but it tells Marta's story and tells it beautifully. It only took 90 minutes to fall in love with Marta and her story. As soon as the movie finished, we walked around to admire all of Marta's art work adorning the walls and took a tour of the opera house and bought her autobiography.It's hard to find the audience for this documentary since its audience is so vast. For anyone who loves dancing, opera, desert living, death valley, animal rights, love stories, art, old hotels, mining town history, and so on, will absolutely love this story and documentary.",5,Beautiful story of a woman and a vision.,1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,1790,"['spent', 'time', 'Shoshone', 'California', 'saw', 'sign', '34', 'Death', 'Valley', 'Junction', '34', 'pointing', 'down', '127', 'always', 'name', 'was', 'great', 'would', 'love', 'visit', 'then', 'saw', 'documentary', 'Manson', 'Family', 'called', 'Inside', 'Manson', 'Gang', 'gang', 'were', 'pulled', 'over', 'Shoshone', 'sheriff', 'right', 'next', 'sign', 'again', 'made', 'interested', 'town.So', 'planned', 'trip', 'Death', 'Valley', 'planned', 'stay', 'Amargosa', 'Hotel', 'Death', 'Valley', 'Junction', 'read', 'up', 'history', 'Marta', 'Becket', 'became', 'very', 'excited', 'stay', 'here.Sadly', 'when', 'drove', 'Marta', 'was', 'not', 'performing', 'was', 'tail', 'end', 'two', 'deceitful', 'greedy', '34', 'hotel', 'managers', '34', 'swindling', 'Marta', 'allowing', 'suffer', 'medically', 'seemed', 'grim', 'time', 'Amergosa', 'Opera', 'House', 'Hotel', 'Knowing', 'made', 'bit', 'sad', 'stop', 'place', 'was', 'really', 'lacking', 'energy', 'cafe', 'was', 'closed', 'office', 'was', 'basically', 'closed', 'saw', 'one', 'person.Thankfully', 'things', 'have', 'gotten', 'better', 'digress.When', 'stopped', 'were', 'allowed', 'view', 'movie', 'dining', 'hall', 'other', 'visitor', 'day', 'blew', 'only', 'documentary', 'beautifully', 'done', 'Marta', 'story', 'beautifully', 'only', 'took', '90', 'minutes', 'fall', 'love', 'Marta', 'story', 'As', 'soon', 'movie', 'finished', 'walked', 'admire', 'Marta', 'art', 'work', 'adorning', 'walls', 'took', 'tour', 'opera', 'house', 'bought', 'autobiography.It', 'hard', 'find', 'audience', 'documentary', 'audience', 'so', 'vast', 'anyone', 'who', 'dancing', 'opera', 'desert', 'living', 'death', 'valley', 'animal', 'rights', 'love', 'stories', 'art', 'old', 'hotels', 'mining', 'town', 'history', 'so', 'will', 'absolutely', 'love', 'story', 'documentary']",N/A

Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[8, 8]","AMARGOSA is the story of Marta Beckett an artist and dancer who at the age of 43 left her native Manhattan to settle in a tiny isolated town in the California desert called Death Valley Junction.  The town  was developed in the early 20th century for the Borax mining industry but at the time Marta first came there it was a virtual ghost town with an abandoned theater and hotel that Marta and her then husband renovated.  Marta soon covered the walls with intricate murals and begin giving solo dance performances as her audience gradually expanded.The film meanders at time with too lengthy sequences concerning the possibility of the hotel being haunted, Marta feeding the wild horses and the shooting of wild burros by Death Valley National Park rangers.  Yet the film is quite fascinating when Marta talks about her relationships - the complicated bond with her controlling but artistically nurturing mother, the breakup of her marriage to her husband because he took second place to her artistic visions and her unlikely late in life partnership with Tom a roto rooter operator who joins her on stage as a clumsy clown to her delicate dancer.  Marta describes her life in the desert as one little yellow flower blooming all by itself and that is the image I will remember from this documentary about a strong and unusual woman.",4,"""Don't Fence Her In""",1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,1334,"['AMARGOSA', 'story', 'Marta', 'Beckett', 'artist', 'dancer', 'who', 'age', '43', 'left', 'native', 'Manhattan', 'settle', 'tiny', 'isolated', 'town', 'California', 'desert', 'called', 'Death', 'Valley', 'Junction', 'town', 'was', 'developed', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'Borax', 'mining', 'industry', 'time', 'Marta', 'first', 'came', 'was', 'virtual', 'ghost', 'town', 'abandoned', 'theater', 'hotel', 'Marta', 'then', 'husband', 'renovated', 'Marta', 'soon', 'covered', 'walls', 'intricate', 'murals', 'begin', 'giving', 'solo', 'dance', 'performances', 'audience', 'gradually', 'film', 'meanders', 'time', 'too', 'lengthy', 'sequences', 'concerning', 'possibility', 'hotel', 'being', 'haunted', 'Marta', 'feeding', 'wild', 'horses', 'shooting', 'wild', 'burros', 'Death', 'Valley', 'National', 'Park', 'rangers', 'film', 'quite', 'fascinating', 'when', 'Marta', 'talks', 'relationships', 'complicated', 'bond', 'controlling', 'artistically', 'nurturing', 'mother', 'breakup', 'marriage', 'husband', 'took', 'second', 'place', 'artistic', 'visions', 'unlikely', 'late', 'life', 'partnership', 'Tom', 'roto', 'rooter', 'operator', 'who', 'stage', 'clumsy', 'clown', 'delicate', 'dancer', 'Marta', 'life', 'desert', 'one', 'little', 'yellow', 'flower', 'blooming', 'image', 'will', 'remember', 'documentary', 'strong', 'unusual', 'woman']",N/A
1028695,A1A3485UTN4SS,B000JLTSBW,The Delite Rancher,"[6, 6]","There are many interesting and mysterious things to see and do in the Mojave Desert. Since most of these things are historical or natural, Marta Becket is one of the few living human attractions. ""Amargosa"" is a documentary about Becket and her life as a dancer and painter at the Amargosa Opera House. ""Amargosa"" chronicles her childhood, early family dynamics, marriage and the events that inspired her to open a performance hall in Death Valley Junction. ""Amargosa"" is a well-made film that was crafted with a good deal of love. Footage includes restored photographs of her New York years and early days in Death Valley Junction. Those who've only know an elderly Becket will be surprised to watch vintage footage of a young and spry dancer. Helicopter shots provide poetic images of the town from the air. The interview is often used to document Becket, Wilget (her then partner), Ray Bradbury (sci-fi writer), visitors and townsfolk. Mary McDonnell (President Laura Roslin in the new Battlestar Galactica) provides poetic narration. The main event is a performance for a bus load of former New York City colleagues. Amazon reviewer bellczar's constructive feedback is valid. The one and a half hour film is long winded as it shares just about every imaginable detail about Becket and the town. Vignettes include her burro adoption program, pet cats and the town ghosts. While being comprehensive, let's remember that this is the only theatrical look at a cultural institution. Already, her partner Wilget has passed away so that anybody seeing her recent shows will only find solo performances. At some point in the near future, Marta Becket will permanently retire from being a unique part of the area's living history. As her murals suggest, she may eternally dance over the opera house. ""Amaragosa"" is a call for everybody to see her perform before she's gone. After she joins Wilget, the only tangible remnants will be the opera house and hotel, herbookand this Emmy Award-winning documentary. See it now or you'll regent not having gone when you had the chance. Since not everybody can make the trip to the edge of Death Valley, the next best thing is to cherish this film as the essence of an uncommon person in a special place and time. Marta Becket carved out her own vision of rugged individualism in an artistic way that can inspire all of us to self-actualize.",4,The Story of Marta Becket,1219104000,"08 19, 2008",2008,2376,"['are', 'many', 'interesting', 'mysterious', 'things', 'see', 'do', 'Mojave', 'Desert', 'most', 'things', 'are', 'historical', 'natural', 'Marta', 'Becket', 'one', 'few', 'living', 'human', 'attractions', 'Amargosa', 'documentary', 'Becket', 'life', 'dancer', 'painter', 'Amargosa', 'Opera', 'House', 'Amargosa', 'childhood', 'early', 'family', 'dynamics', 'marriage', 'events', 'inspired', 'open', 'performance', 'hall', 'Death', 'Valley', 'Junction', 'Amargosa', 'well-made', 'film', 'was', 'crafted', 'good', 'deal', 'love', 'Footage', 'restored', 'photographs', 'New', 'York', 'years', 'early', 'days', 'Death', 'Valley', 'Junction', 'who', ""'ve"", 'only', 'know', 'elderly', 'Becket', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'watch', 'vintage', 'footage', 'young', 'spry', 'dancer', 'Helicopter', 'shots', 'provide', 'poetic', 'images', 'town', 'air', 'interview', 'often', 'used', 'document', 'Becket', 'Wilget', 'then', 'partner', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'sci-fi', 'writer', 'visitors', 'townsfolk', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'President', 'Laura', 'Roslin', 'new', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'poetic', 'narration', 'main', 'event', 'performance', 'bus', 'load', 'former', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'colleagues', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'bellczar', 'constructive', 'feedback', 'valid', 'one', 'half', 'hour', 'film', 'long', 'winded', 'shares', 'just', 'imaginable', 'detail', 'Becket', 'town', 'Vignettes', 'include', 'burro', 'adoption', 'program', 'pet', 'cats', 'town', 'ghosts', 'being', 'comprehensive', 'let', 'remember', 'only', 'theatrical', 'look', 'cultural', 'institution', 'Already', 'partner', 'Wilget', 'passed', 'away', 'anybody', 'seeing', 'recent', 'shows', 'will', 'only', 'find', 'solo', 'performances', 'point', 'near', 'future', 'Marta', 'Becket', 'will', 'permanently', 'retire', 'being', 'unique', 'part', 'area', 'living', 'history', 'murals', 'suggest', 'may', 'eternally', 'dance', 'opera', 'house', 'Amaragosa', 'call', 'everybody', 'see', 'perform', 'gone', 'Wilget', 'only', 'tangible', 'remnants', 'will', 'be', 'opera', 'house', 'hotel', 'herbookand', 'Emmy', 'Award-winning', 'documentary', 'See', 'now', ""'ll"", 'regent', 'not', 'having', 'gone', 'when', 'had', 'chance', 'not', 'everybody', 'can', 'make', 'trip', 'edge', 'Death', 'Valley', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'cherish', 'film', 'essence', 'uncommon', 'person', 'special', 'place', 'time', 'Marta', 'Becket', 'carved', 'out', 'own', 'vision', 'rugged', 'individualism', 'artistic', 'way', 'can', 'inspire', 'self-actualize']",N/A
