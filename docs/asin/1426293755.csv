Well, the animations showing swimming motion, etc., seemed pretty good.  The depiction of a Cretaceous sea was also good, and, yes, a dangerous place to be.  What left me lacking, though, was the actual lack of scientific content.  Sure, scientific names of things were tossed around, and places where different fossils were discovered were shown and their discoveries re-enacted, but there was too little of the discovering to be engaging, and there was too little of the scientific analysis of what they found to really hold my attention.I guess I'd have to say that this documentary came across as being pretty, um, well, ""Junior High.""  I certainly wouldn't recommend this documentary to my college freshman general science students...there's not really enough here for their time.I know, this documentary reminds me a lot of the book ""Raptor Red"" by Robert Bakker,though that book had more detail and scientific content.The premis of following one individual through its life had promise, but I think that the authors and producers simply tried to take on too much in too short a time frame.  Telling one of the stories they showed in enough detail to be meaningful would have been more rewarding to me as a viewer.  And, who were the people they showed with the modern fossils?  Were they the actual scientists who unearthed the fossils?  What are their names?  Where do they work?Also, I was kind of put off by the subtle anthropomorphism of the species shown...not too bad, but it was there...the flashbacks at the end, for instance.  Anyway, I did like, just ""like"" the show, but it really played like an extended preview for something I would love to see.  Something with some real scientific meat to it.

There's ""Jurassic Park"" and other movies. There's Barney. All major natural history museums have exhibits. Dinosaurs are many states' ""official fossil"" and on and on. Well, why not? Even though they constitute only a small portion of the total Mesozoic fauna, they're generally large and spectacular and grab the imagination like no other fossil group. The Mesozoic Era was a glorious time for the reptiles and not just the Dinosaurs. The Mesozoic oceans had an assemblage of large marine reptiles that were just as remarkable in their habitats as the Dinosaurs were on land. Giant marine turtles, Ichthyosaurs, Plesiosaurs of great variety and ferocious Mosasaurs, in addition to some pretty gigantic sharks and other fish, roamed the Mesozoic seaways. ""Sea Monsters: A prehistoric Adventure"" is a film put together to depict the marine fauna of this time span.""Sea Monsters"" weaves multiple lines of information together. First, there's the group of paleontologists who are collecting and curateing the fossils. Second are the nature and animated recreations of the fossils themselves. Third is a little story that the fossils supposedly reveal regarding some small short-necked plesiosaurs referred to as dollies (a mother and two siblings) who venture out into the mean Cretaceous sea about 82 million years ago. Finally, the movie gives an interesting and spectacular viewing of the geologic history of the seaway, both in map and perspective views. Would the average viewer (especially kids) comprehend and appreciate the complexly interwoven story? Probably not. However, they well might enjoy many facets of the film especially some spectacular animated versions of the Mesozoic marine creatures. A person well versed in natural history might view the film in an entirely different way and find it to be very interesting and well done. The DVD could be repeatedly viewed, especially by children. As their knowledge grew, probably their understanding and appreciation would also grow. Same for adults. The film has good educational potential. Personally, my favorite portion of the film would be the animations. It was delightful to view creatures that I've read about in spectacular live versions.I should probably issue a disclosure at this point. I served as a scientific consultant to this film and I'm listed in the closing credits. I received no remuneration or expenses and have no financial tie-ins with the filming company or The National Geographic Society, and none was expected. My interest was in the fossils and the story they were telling and I'm delighted with the final results. I viewed the film at the Rueben Fleet IMAX Theater with Director Sean Phillips and others and greatly enjoyed the evening. The DVD could not possibly be as spectacular as my viewing, but I have full confidence that the DVD version will show well on a wide-screen TV.Gary Peterson",5,Ancient Adventure.,1210291200,"05 9, 2008",2008,2981,"['Dinosaurs', 'are', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'fossils', 'kids', 'seem', 'know', 'one', 'way', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'other', 'movies', 'Barney', 'major', 'natural', 'history', 'museums', 'have', 'exhibits', 'Dinosaurs', 'are', 'many', 'states', 'official', 'fossil', 'Well', 'why', 'not', 'Even', 'constitute', 'only', 'small', 'portion', 'total', 'Mesozoic', 'fauna', ""'re"", 'generally', 'large', 'spectacular', 'grab', 'imagination', 'other', 'fossil', 'group', 'Mesozoic', 'Era', 'was', 'glorious', 'time', 'reptiles', 'not', 'just', 'Dinosaurs', 'Mesozoic', 'oceans', 'had', 'assemblage', 'large', 'marine', 'reptiles', 'were', 'just', 'remarkable', 'habitats', 'Dinosaurs', 'were', 'land', 'Giant', 'marine', 'turtles', 'Ichthyosaurs', 'Plesiosaurs', 'great', 'variety', 'ferocious', 'Mosasaurs', 'addition', 'pretty', 'gigantic', 'sharks', 'other', 'fish', 'roamed', 'Mesozoic', 'seaways', 'Sea', 'Monsters', 'prehistoric', 'Adventure', 'film', 'put', 'together', 'depict', 'marine', 'fauna', 'time', 'span', 'Sea', 'Monsters', 'multiple', 'lines', 'information', 'together', 'First', 'group', 'paleontologists', 'who', 'are', 'collecting', 'curateing', 'fossils', 'Second', 'are', 'nature', 'animated', 'recreations', 'fossils', 'Third', 'little', 'story', 'fossils', 'supposedly', 'reveal', 'regarding', 'small', 'short-necked', 'plesiosaurs', 'referred', 'dollies', 'mother', 'two', 'siblings', 'who', 'venture', 'out', 'mean', 'Cretaceous', 'sea', '82', 'million', 'years', 'ago', 'Finally', 'movie', 'interesting', 'spectacular', 'viewing', 'geologic', 'history', 'seaway', 'map', 'perspective', 'views', 'Would', 'average', 'viewer', 'especially', 'kids', 'comprehend', 'appreciate', 'complexly', 'interwoven', 'story', 'Probably', 'not', 'However', 'well', 'might', 'enjoy', 'many', 'facets', 'film', 'especially', 'spectacular', 'animated', 'versions', 'Mesozoic', 'marine', 'creatures', 'person', 'well', 'versed', 'natural', 'history', 'might', 'view', 'film', 'entirely', 'different', 'way', 'find', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'well', 'done', 'DVD', 'could', 'be', 'repeatedly', 'viewed', 'especially', 'children', 'knowledge', 'grew', 'probably', 'understanding', 'appreciation', 'would', 'also', 'grow', 'Same', 'adults', 'film', 'good', 'educational', 'potential', 'Personally', 'favorite', 'portion', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'animations', 'was', 'delightful', 'view', 'creatures', ""'ve"", 'read', 'spectacular', 'live', 'versions.I', 'should', 'probably', 'issue', 'disclosure', 'point', 'served', 'scientific', 'consultant', 'film', ""'m"", 'listed', 'closing', 'credits', 'received', 'remuneration', 'expenses', 'have', 'financial', 'tie-ins', 'filming', 'company', 'National', 'Geographic', 'Society', 'none', 'was', 'expected', 'interest', 'was', 'fossils', 'story', 'were', 'telling', ""'m"", 'delighted', 'final', 'results', 'viewed', 'film', 'Rueben', 'Fleet', 'IMAX', 'Theater', 'Director', 'Sean', 'Phillips', 'others', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'evening', 'DVD', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'be', 'as', 'spectacular', 'viewing', 'have', 'full', 'confidence', 'DVD', 'version', 'will', 'show', 'well', 'wide-screen', 'TV.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A

First of all, the content of this movie could have been narrated in 15 minutes; as a result, the movie seems to repeat the same concept over and over again therefore being very predictable in where it is going.Second of all, the movie was very obviously designed to be watched in 3-D.  The effect is just not the same in 2-D as fish swim towards the screen in 2-D and objects awkwardly jut towards the camera.  While I'm sure this movie was engaging in 3-D, watching at home in 2-D was actually rather boring and non-engaging.I've thoroughly enjoyed other National Geographic presentations on Blu-ray such as Relentless Enemies, however this one seems to be short on substance and designed for color 3-D delivery which is not really possible on Blu-ray yet.

Raphael ""AstraDaemon of The Zombiep...","[20, 22]","The special effects were amazing, a lot of information was given, wonderful narration, and the storyline was interesting.However, I can't bring myself to give more than three stars because the staged paleontologist scenes were too cheesy for me...I don't know if better actors would have made a difference.  Just when we were getting into the scenes with the prehistoric creatures, it would cut away to a reacreation of how the fossils were found - it was very distracting.I think maybe they should have separated those scenes from the main storyline, and offered the fossil information as a special feature for the DVD.If you prefer the set-up of DVDs such asChased By Sea MonstersorWhen Dinosaurs Roamed America, you might have the same problem trying to sit through this DVD.We bought this DVd for our three-year old son who is fascinated with prehistoric sea monsters...he loves the parts featuring the creatures, but kept wandering off whenever they cut to the staged ""people"" scenes.

177664,ABGOCL0QVZRUL,1426293755,W. Andrew Terrill,"[0, 0]","This National Geographic video follows the life of an extinct Dolichorhynchops, a dolphin-sized short-necked plesiosaur from the late Cretaceous.  This animal lived in the amazingly diverse inland sea which was centered in Kansas during that time period.  The presentation switched back and forth between fossil hunters and recreations of the ""dolly's"" life.  In that life, the dolly encounters a number of other ocean creatures including a shark which wounds it and a long necked Styxosaurus.  The film makers also pay strong attention to the Tylosaurs which were at the top of the food chain.  Most interesting to me is the fossil of a ""fish within a fish"" whereby a 13 foot Xiphactinus swallowed a smaller (6 foot) Gillicus fish and then seems to have died from damage inflicted on its internal organs.  What an incredible glutton, and yes I double checked the length of the two fish.  The fossil of these intertwined fish is currently on display at the Sternberg Museum of Natural History in Hays, Kansas according to the presentation, and I think the Sternberg Museum just made my bucket list. In sum, I found this to be an excellent film, although I wish it had been longer and more comprehensive. Also just FYI--There is also a beautiful Dolichorhynchops skeleton at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC.
