242884,A3CGVO10F7NPMJ,6301008952,A Customer,"[11, 12]","There have been lots of movies that Ive seen that have made me laugh from time to time while watching, but 1987's &quot;Stakeout&quot; with Richard Dreyfuss was one of the best comedies of the 80s. Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez play two joking and bumbling police detectives, who are assigned to a seemingly boring stakeout of the house of an escaped criminal's girlfriend. After Dreyfuss though, broken up after his wife leaves, falls in love with the focus of their investigation...he digs a hole for himself so deep he finds it hard to be a lover AND a cop at the same time. Its a perfect scenerio, when Dreyfuss does his best to keep his relationship across the street from the eyes of his collegues, and himself out of trouble. The only one who knows of this escapade is Estevez, who watches the hilarious antics of his partner through a camera across the street. Until I saw this movie I never took notice of Richard Dreyfuss, and I saw the Emilio Estevez of the 80s in many troublemaking roles of hard-core youth kinda movies like &quot;That Was Then, This Is Now&quot;. Needless to say this hysterical movie is was a different and perfectly played out comedy...that worked so well they HAD to make a sequal: &quot;Another Stakeout&quot;. The 1998 movie &quot;This Is My Father&quot;'s Aidan Quinn was the perfect bad guy in &quot;Stakeout&quot;, this time without the heavy brogue. What can I say, it's a great movie, give it a try if you like the actors.",4,When It Puts You In Hysterical Pain...Its a Good Comedy,992649600,"06 16, 2001",2001,1461,"['have', 'been', 'lots', 'movies', 'Ive', 'seen', 'have', 'made', 'time', 'time', 'watching', '1987', 'quot', 'Stakeout', 'quot', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', '80s', 'Dreyfuss', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'play', 'two', 'joking', 'bumbling', 'police', 'detectives', 'who', 'are', 'assigned', 'seemingly', 'boring', 'stakeout', 'house', 'escaped', 'criminal', 'girlfriend', 'Dreyfuss', 'broken', 'up', 'wife', 'love', 'focus', 'investigation', 'hole', 'so', 'deep', 'hard', 'be', 'lover', 'cop', 'same', 'time', 'perfect', 'scenerio', 'when', 'Dreyfuss', 'best', 'keep', 'relationship', 'street', 'eyes', 'collegues', 'trouble', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'escapade', 'Estevez', 'who', 'hilarious', 'antics', 'partner', 'camera', 'street', 'saw', 'movie', 'never', 'took', 'notice', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'saw', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', '80s', 'many', 'troublemaking', 'roles', 'hard-core', 'youth', 'kinda', 'movies', 'quot', 'Was', 'Then', 'Now', 'quot', 'Needless', 'say', 'hysterical', 'movie', 'was', 'different', 'perfectly', 'played', 'out', 'comedy', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'HAD', 'make', 'sequal', 'quot', 'Stakeout', 'quot', '1998', 'movie', 'quot', 'My', 'Father', 'quot', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'was', 'perfect', 'bad', 'guy', 'quot', 'Stakeout', 'quot', 'time', 'heavy', 'brogue', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'great', 'movie', 'give', 'try', 'like', 'actors']",N/A

I do think however the film would have been a lot more watchable if it hadn't been for Emilio Estevez's god awful weedy little mustache. How long did that take him to grow? A few months? Take it from me sweetie, it doesn't make you less baby-faced, it makes you stupid. And how about Madeleine Stowe? She was certainly the best bit about the movie, and for trivia fans, she also appeared in Little House On The Prairie. Good grief, now how do I know that? :)I think the poster for this movie, is really fabulous, but corny as hell! I wasn't sure about Richard Dreyfuss, he was OK, but why did they have to make him fall in love with the pretty young lady? Hasn't that been done enough now? And it's predictable as hell. The practical jokes were hilarious though. Richard and Emilio were having a movie trivia contest on the set one day. Emilio asked Richard to identify the movie that the line ""This is no boating accident"" was from. He didn't recognize the quote, despite the fact that he was the actor who said it in Jaws. Deciding that this was too good to pass up, this incident was re-enacted for the film. Emilio & Richard actually work really well with each other, and are actually a lot of other ""buddy cop"" movies. At least they didn't do the old cop-near-retiring-taking-on-a-young-upstart. And is it just me, or does Emilio conveniently disappear for most of the second half?I'm not keen on Aidan Quinn as the bad guy. It's just not him. And how BAD was his hair?
