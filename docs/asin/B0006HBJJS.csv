These totally amoral ""Christians"" will turn your stomach as they beat and abuse and kill other humans at will.The other endless aspect is the film itself. It goes on far too long, due in major part to endless pointless closeups of Northrup, staring off, staring into the camera, trying not to emote, observing as a powerless bystander, witness, or even participant. There must be five full minutes if him just staring.Unfortunately, because of the subject matter, this film is a must-see.

867947,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B0006HBJJS,Doug Anderson,"[3, 5]","Black Girl, Killer of Sheep, 12 Years A Slave: I've seen two classics of Black World Cinema recently, Sembene' s Black Girl (1966) and Burnett's Killer of Sheep(1979). They are both about the loss of identity in various forms of work, in various social systems, and both feature music as a safe haven, a school, a church, a museum, a communal refuge from our worldly masters. So when I saw 12 Years a Slave it was all very familiar---loss of identity narrative, song as surrender, as soul-elevating refuge/respite from this weary world. All three films work by stripping (sometimes literally) the main character of his/her singularity . All three films feature a character who longs to distinguish him or herself who longs to establish a separate identity, a private dignity, but all three films show the community to be larger than any single member, and all three films show that its the community that carries the individual and gives each life it's meaning, its ""individual"" worth. So all three films work against the notion of individual expression, against the notion of ego, of hubris. And one imagines while watching each of these three films that the person each of these artists/directors has in mind while telling their respective stories is themselves. Each director has his/her distinct style but each of these directors places that ""individual"" style in the service of a larger, communal truth, and the larger community and truth in each of these films is not a black or a white community or truth but a human community and a human truth. All three films show art (cinema and song) to be the school, the church, the museum where whatever is not right in this world can be presented in a way that sustains the weary and condemns whatever it is in this life that makes us so.",5,12 Years a Slave in the context of Black World Cinema,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,1787,"['Black', 'Girl', 'Killer', 'Sheep', '12', 'Years', 'Slave', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'two', 'classics', 'Black', 'World', 'Cinema', 'recently', 'Sembene', 's', 'Black', 'Girl', '1966', 'Burnett', 'Killer', 'Sheep', '1979', 'are', 'loss', 'identity', 'various', 'forms', 'work', 'various', 'social', 'systems', 'feature', 'music', 'safe', 'haven', 'school', 'church', 'museum', 'communal', 'refuge', 'worldly', 'masters', 'when', 'saw', '12', 'Years', 'Slave', 'was', 'very', 'familiar', 'identity', 'narrative', 'song', 'surrender', 'soul-elevating', 'refuge/respite', 'weary', 'world', 'three', 'films', 'work', 'stripping', 'sometimes', 'literally', 'main', 'character', 'his/her', 'singularity', 'three', 'films', 'feature', 'character', 'who', 'distinguish', 'who', 'establish', 'separate', 'identity', 'private', 'dignity', 'three', 'films', 'show', 'community', 'be', 'larger', 'single', 'member', 'three', 'films', 'show', 'community', 'individual', 'life', 'meaning', 'individual', 'worth', 'three', 'films', 'work', 'notion', 'individual', 'expression', 'notion', 'ego', 'hubris', 'one', 'imagines', 'watching', 'three', 'films', 'person', 'artists/directors', 'mind', 'telling', 'respective', 'stories', 'director', 'his/her', 'distinct', 'style', 'directors', 'places', 'individual', 'style', 'service', 'larger', 'communal', 'truth', 'larger', 'community', 'truth', 'films', 'not', 'black', 'white', 'community', 'truth', 'human', 'community', 'human', 'truth', 'three', 'films', 'show', 'art', 'cinema', 'song', 'be', 'school', 'church', 'museum', 'where', 'not', 'right', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'presented', 'way', 'weary', 'whatever', 'life', 'so']",N/A
