I don't know if it is because I am x-military and also a combat vet that the movie turned my stomach more then a few times in the beginning alone, but i found it violent, disturbing enough to want to shut it off. Usually if a movie affects me, i will fast fwd thru the nasty parts, but with this one i didn't even want to continue it. I had to leave the room during those parts. I encountered this mostly in the beginning parts of the movie. I was able to watch the rest of it (after he escapes) just fine.Gibson did a good job definitely with portraying the primitive ppl/times of those ppl. I just can't believe this came out of his head.As much as I was turned off in the beginning of the movie, i am still giving it a good rating, because the director did his job and got across what he wanted us to see and experience.I wouldn't see it again, or own it.

'Braveheart,' 'The Passion of Christ,' and, now 'Apocalypto' all are violent in epic proportions.  'Apocalypto' is startlingly savage.  This time we have the historical fiction presented with a happy Mayan village.  Complete with warriors and hunters we are given some colorful characters--not just from their face paint--including a misfit who isn't able to provide fertility.  One day they unsuspectingly come across another tribe--one that will provide menace for the sleeping village.  They are later raped and pillaged, and the survivors are shackled under a common yoke.  We find that they are brought to Mayan civilization where they will be made a sacrifice to their pagan god to appease all misfortune, including crop disasters.The presentation is certainly remarkable enough as the village hero, Jaguar's Paw, escapes on a harrowing journey that reminds one of the most urgent rendering of 'Lord of the Flies' that's yet to be presented.  The startling savagery comes to the fore with fearless detail.  The cinematography is masterful and their predicament is framed in every scene.  Some of the moon shots and New Age wind instrumentation is reminiscent of 'The Passion of Christ,' but 'Apocalypto' is a group project with a whole tribe in view--even if one hero is its focal point.  Anguish and a sweeping chase are skillfully presented in yet another Mel masterpiece.(Hollywood has presented two opposing viewpoints this year, whose contrast is a telling dichotomy.  There's 'The Da Vinci Code' and Professor Teabing's take that Constantine (an ancient and non-fiction historical figure) and Silas (a modern but fictional character) represent the strife and brutality that Christianity has dispensed in its two thousand year history.  And, then there's Mel's portrayal of one pagan civilization that was brutal until it was tamed by Spanish conquistadors.  A telling contrast.)",5,The Most Dangerous Game,1165622400,"12 9, 2006",2006,2001,"['are', 'two', 'features', 'can', 'now', 'expect', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'big', 'will', 'be', 'bloody', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'now', 'are', 'violent', 'epic', 'proportions', 'startlingly', 'savage', 'time', 'have', 'historical', 'fiction', 'presented', 'happy', 'Mayan', 'village', 'Complete', 'warriors', 'hunters', 'are', 'given', 'colorful', 'characters', 'not', 'just', 'face', 'paint', 'including', 'misfit', 'who', ""n't"", 'able', 'provide', 'fertility', 'One', 'day', 'unsuspectingly', 'come', 'tribe', 'one', 'will', 'provide', 'menace', 'sleeping', 'village', 'are', 'later', 'raped', 'pillaged', 'survivors', 'are', 'shackled', 'common', 'yoke', 'find', 'are', 'brought', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'sacrifice', 'pagan', 'god', 'appease', 'misfortune', 'including', 'crop', 'disasters.The', 'presentation', 'certainly', 'remarkable', 'enough', 'village', 'hero', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'harrowing', 'journey', 'one', 'most', 'urgent', 'rendering', ""'Lord"", 'Flies', 'yet', 'be', 'presented', 'startling', 'savagery', 'fore', 'fearless', 'detail', 'cinematography', 'masterful', 'predicament', 'framed', 'scene', 'moon', 'shots', 'New', 'Age', 'wind', 'instrumentation', 'reminiscent', ""'The"", 'Passion', 'Christ', ""'Apocalypto"", 'group', 'project', 'whole', 'tribe', 'view', 'even', 'one', 'hero', 'focal', 'point', 'Anguish', 'sweeping', 'chase', 'are', 'skillfully', 'presented', 'yet', 'Mel', 'masterpiece', 'Hollywood', 'presented', 'two', 'opposing', 'viewpoints', 'year', 'contrast', 'telling', 'dichotomy', ""'The"", 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'Professor', 'Teabing', 'take', 'Constantine', 'ancient', 'non-fiction', 'historical', 'figure', 'Silas', 'modern', 'fictional', 'character', 'represent', 'strife', 'brutality', 'Christianity', 'dispensed', 'two', 'thousand', 'year', 'history', 'then', 'Mel', 'portrayal', 'one', 'pagan', 'civilization', 'was', 'brutal', 'was', 'tamed', 'Spanish', 'conquistadors', 'telling', 'contrast']",N/A

1005556,A21V79LYT2Q5PH,B000GNOKQG,"A. D. Anderson ""Flying Gamer""","[1, 4]","Following Passion, this movie is not something you want to view with young children.  Gibson has distinguished himself as a director/writer who is willing to show the unpleasant side of life.  I wondered going in how much plot it would have, the previews just showed a guy running around in a jungle.  I was really surprised how this film pulled me in.  If nothing else, I think it does an excellent job of showing how life was in the Mayan culture.  The barbaric cruelty and lack of respect for life made me appreciate living in civilized times.  The movie follows the span of just a few dramatic days of a young man living in a jungle village.  The first half of the film is outstanding.  It shows in meticulous detail how people survived and adapted in an incredibly harsh environment; to the point where I cared and saw how life was, although unpleasant, worth living.  Absolute barbarism is demonstrated not too far into it.  The character development is such that I hated to see this cruelty played out on people I felt I had started to know.  There were several points throughout that made me cringe.  A few even brought tears to my eyes.  As the movie progressed, however, I started having problems with it.  The prophecy by the young girl raised an eyebrow.  The solar eclipse raised two.  After that it was an inter-mix of concern for the characters (who faced a very uncertain fate) and laughable plot points.  It came to the point where I noted that even the waterfall scene was unrealistic (I'm no geography major, but I'm pretty sure there aren't a whole lot of major waterfalls within a mile or so of an ocean where this story takes place).  The ending was very ""Lord of the Flies,""  and I wonder if Touchstone is paying royalties.  In the end, I would recommend that you check out this movie.  If you've read this far into my review you are interested enough to sit through it.  You won't be disappointed.  Empathize with the characters and try to experience for a few hours what life was like in that place and time.  Realize, however, that it becomes very ""Indiana Jones"" about half-way through, and anyone with an IQ over 100 is going to wonder what all the goofiness is about.  I'd recommend it as a rental, and Blu-ray is definately worth checking out (here's hoping the local Blockbuster starts carrying them so I can rent, not buy).  If you liked Passion and think you'll like this, pick it up.  You won't be disappointed if you buy it.

1005559,A20HNT8HYIYY0X,B000GNOKQG,"Adrian Stranik ""Ade""","[0, 1]","Mel Gibson's public persona evokes nothing more or less than a portrait of buffoonery of late, what with his drink/driving/anti-Semitism/cop berating; not to mention his English bashing `The Patriot' and `Braveheart', (The battle of Stirling Bridge without a bridge! Oops.) But his biblical oeuvre `Passion of the Christ' and now `Apocalypto' implies a directing capability bordering on brilliance.Mayan civilisation on the eve of `Hurricane Conquistador' is a society in decline after a thousand years of being one of the most advanced in the world. A Young tribesman, Jaguar Paw is captured, along with what remains of his village, after a vicious attack by an army of warriors from the big city and taken on a perilous journey for a date with unspeakable evil. What follows is a breathtaking action thriller that transports you into 15th century Mexico and a world of untold savagery.An air of mysticism permeates this tale but it never quite spills over into the realms of the supernatural making a couple of seemingly exasperating divine interventions borderline believable. All the dialogue is authentic Yacatec Mayan and the cast are predominantly indigenous to the Mesoamerica's giving the sensation of an authentic glimpse into the past.Apocalypto is the story of a culture in conflict with itself and thus rendered fair game for the destructive machinations of more powerful outsiders implying that progress and sophistication brings an inherent soullessness, corruption and ultimately self-annihilation.

1005562,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B000GNOKQG,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[3, 9]","****Spoilers****What a show this movie was.... it thrusts us into the spirit of the Ancient Maya, and restrains nothing in its telling of the tale, which is quite simple in itself.A young man, Jaguar Paw, with a pregnant wife and a young son, goes hunting Tapir for food in the forest, when they come across a horde of people passing through. They tell him their village was ravaged, and while the others listen and simply move on to the village resuming their lives, the encounter with these people haunts Jaguar Paw.Rightfully so, as a mere day later, the same people come and ravage his village. They attack the men, kill those who resist, and enslave all save the children, who they simply leave behind to follow their parents in tears until they cannot follow any longer.Along the way, a diseased young girl tells of a prophecy, in which a man of the Jaguar will bring about the doom of those slavers who listen to her, and all sorts of other omens such as ""He who runs with the Jaguar"".Enslaved, they are taken to a great city made of stone, where one by one the women are sold into slavery, and the men are taken to the top of a great temple to be sacrificed to the Gods, as these people fear that their Gods are displeased, and their end approaches.Just as Jaguar Paw is to be sacrificed, a solar eclipse takes place which the High Priest interprets as the Gods' satisfaction, and lets Jaguar Paw live.The slavers then take the remaining captives to an empty arena-like field, and release the captives two at a time, telling them to try to run away into the forests, while they shoot at them from behind with slings, arrows, and javelin, and with the son of the Chief acting as ""Finisher"" to kill the men as they attempt to crawl away, dying from their wounds.Jaguar Paw is shot through the side by an arrow, and just as he is to be killed, his friend (who had been shot down earlier) attacks the Chief's son, and Jaguar Paw is able to break off the arrowhead and kill him with it, before running off into the jungle. The chief and his men chase him.They chase Jaguar Paw all throughout the jungles, and as they do, all of the diseased girl's prophecies come true. Jaguar Paw is being chased by a Jaguar whose cub he accidentally encountered and disrupted, and as one of the men catches up to Jaguar Paw, he is attacked and killed by the cat.Jaguar Paw is running back to his village, as he has left his wife and child inside a deep stony cave in the ground to save them as the villagers are enslaved.One by one, he devises traps and weapons to kill his enemies, before he can rescue his wife. It begins to rain, and the hole is filling with water.Jaguar Paw kills all but two of the men, but is saved when he flees to the beach, and the two pursuers are frozen in their places, astonished at the sight of men in gigantic ships approaching the beach.Jaguar Paw is able to flee and rescue his wife and child, where they retreat into the forest to find a new beginning...The plight of Jaguar Paw was very deeply human, and the acting was richly superb with light, but not sparse dialogue, and a gamut of emotions being run through all the characters, whose facial expressions and cries of anguish, pain, joy, or pleasure tell more than any amount of dialogue ever could. Along with the beautifully realistic jungle setting and cinematography, this is simply put, a masterpiece.It wasn't until recently that I became aware of the historical inaccuracies abound in this film, but this doesn't at all detract from the impact of this film.

Of course, if cinematic violence is not your cup of tea, you might be better off skipping this film. Now, in terms of history, there are several inaccuracies that are obvious to even those of us not heavily versed on the Mayas. Though recent archaeological findings has made obvious in recent years that the Mayas practiced (as many societies throughout history) human sacrifices, the way they are portrayed here seem more related to the Aztecs. Another obvious mistake is having the Spaniards appear at the end: the Mayas had already left the cities by the time the Spanish arrived in the 16th century (for what reason, is the major mystery of the Mayas), and were living in rural villages.",4,Mel Gibson's best film,1170892800,"02 8, 2007",2007,984,"['movie', 'been', 'heavily', 'criticized', 'many', 'least', 'where', 'live', 'actually', 'great', 'adventure', 'film', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'hero', 'chased', 'jungle', 'group', 'Mayas', 'terrific', 'breathtaking', 'film-making', 'best', 'thing', 'Gibson', 'ever', 'made', 'course', 'cinematic', 'violence', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'skipping', 'film', 'Now', 'terms', 'history', 'are', 'several', 'inaccuracies', 'are', 'obvious', 'even', 'not', 'heavily', 'versed', 'Mayas', 'Though', 'recent', 'archaeological', 'findings', 'made', 'obvious', 'recent', 'years', 'Mayas', 'practiced', 'many', 'societies', 'history', 'human', 'sacrifices', 'way', 'are', 'portrayed', 'here', 'seem', 'more', 'related', 'Aztecs', 'obvious', 'mistake', 'having', 'Spaniards', 'appear', 'end', 'Mayas', 'had', 'already', 'left', 'cities', 'time', 'Spanish', 'arrived', '16th', 'century', 'what', 'reason', 'major', 'mystery', 'Mayas', 'were', 'living', 'rural', 'villages']",N/A

One man escapes and races back through the jungle, with pursuers hot on his heels, in order to save the wife and child he had hidden before the attack.There are many ways this film could have been executed, most of them badly.  When I first heard Mel Gibson was making this film and had opted to have the dialogue in (I assume) the actual language of the people's with subtitles, it sounded nuts.  But Mel dared to do it and trusted his film-making craft to do the rest.  And he has succeeded in spades.A wild and intense chase film, done with astonishing skill and cleverness, amid the background of a thorougly imagined time and culture, it grabbed and held my interest throughout.  This is why I still go to the movies.  To be taken someplace in time and geography I could never see for myself.  It's also why I read books.First let me say I did not find the violence excessive.  I thought it was appropriate to the story and not overly dwelt upon.  Mel cuts away when he needs to, and he may have had an extra spray of blood or so, but I actually found more over-the-top violence in The Patriot, a movie Mel was in, but didn't direct.  I did think The Passion was too much, but I'm not reviewing that film. As another reviewer said the various CSI's on TV are sometimes gorier.What I found was a completely engaging film of imagined history, remarkable in its production values, and directed with energy and passion.  That you can draw inferences from the depiction of simple and gentle and all too human life in the village versus the excesses and corruption and degeneracy, albeit just as human, in the Mayan city, is only icing. Mel doesn't explain the reasons for their decline, he just presents it; there to think about at no extra cost.  And, a final irony regarding the clash of cultures rounds out the film's question as to what is truly civilized and what is savage.Many reviews I've read seem to be reviewing, or should I say reviling, Mel Gibson.  Gee, might his Malibu episode have something to do with that?  If we start judging artists works by their despicable personal behavior, we can begin emptying out the museums, libraries, art galleries, and film archives.

The poster for ""Apocalypto"" featuring what looked like a Mayan warrior with the pyramids in the background got me interested. The only other movies I can remember that dealt with the Aztecs or Mayans were ""Captain From Castile"" in the 40's and ""Kings of the Sun"" in the 60's, neither I felt did justice to such impressive civilizations.I wasn't prepared for how Mel would treat such an advanced culture.Somehow the Mayans were able to build great cities, excel in mathematics and create an early calendar but in this movie they act like the crazies from ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"". They spend their time rounding up innocent natives and bringing them into the great city to be tortured and beheaded. I guess they built those great pyramids so they could roll the heads, hearts and bodies of their sacrifices to the bloodthirsty populace below.It's been a long time since I was so let down by what could have been a great subject. After the main character escapes, the movie reminded me of ""The Naked Prey"" or ""Predator"", and the chase is exciting on that level, but why place it during that time and place and ultimately negate the opening quote of Will Durant about a civilization being destroyed from within, when like in ""Captain From Castile"" it looks like the Spanish got 'em.",2,The Temple of Doom meets The Naked Prey,1173225600,"03 7, 2007",2007,1413,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'actor', 'Gallipoli', 'thought', 'Braveheart', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'well', 'directed', 'poster', 'Apocalypto', 'featuring', 'what', 'looked', 'Mayan', 'warrior', 'pyramids', 'background', 'got', 'interested', 'only', 'other', 'movies', 'can', 'remember', 'dealt', 'Aztecs', 'Mayans', 'were', 'Captain', 'From', 'Castile', '40', 'Kings', 'Sun', '60', 'felt', 'did', 'justice', 'such', 'impressive', 'civilizations.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'prepared', 'how', 'Mel', 'would', 'treat', 'such', 'advanced', 'culture.Somehow', 'Mayans', 'were', 'able', 'build', 'great', 'cities', 'excel', 'mathematics', 'create', 'early', 'calendar', 'movie', 'act', 'crazies', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Temple', 'Doom', 'spend', 'time', 'rounding', 'up', 'innocent', 'natives', 'bringing', 'great', 'city', 'be', 'tortured', 'beheaded', 'guess', 'built', 'great', 'pyramids', 'could', 'roll', 'heads', 'hearts', 'bodies', 'sacrifices', 'bloodthirsty', 'populace', 'below.It', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'so', 'let', 'down', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'subject', 'main', 'character', 'escapes', 'movie', 'reminded', 'Naked', 'Prey', 'Predator', 'chase', 'exciting', 'level', 'why', 'place', 'time', 'place', 'ultimately', 'negate', 'opening', 'quote', 'Will', 'Durant', 'civilization', 'being', 'destroyed', 'when', 'Captain', 'From', 'Castile', 'Spanish', 'got']",N/A

Here, in Apocalypto, we have an amazing story of human misery, love, loyalty, and valor. This movie is not for children as it would horrify and depress the living heck out of them, but it definitely is for adults; particularly those adults who wish to categorize and analyze our collective human experience. Our ancestors' lives brimmed with tragedy-plagued days such as these and many of these scenes are unforgettable.Most importantly, Apocalypto illustrates how foolish we are to be as obsessed over comparatively insignificant matters such as race, ethnicity, and culture. The hero here, Jaguar Paw, is a member of a different race, time, and culture than my own, yet this reviewer--and practically every other person who sees this film--cheered for his survival with dramatic intensity. This is due to our ability to relate to him at a level far deeper than that of race, sex, and class. All of us intrinsically feel a need to defeat forces of unscrupulous evil, and that is bigger than the superficial conditions placed upon us by our birth. What these small Mayan clans faced at that time was an apocalypse, and Jaguar Paw is a man we should all admire. I could not turn this one off and disagree with the other reviewers who criticized its ending.

1005576,A3LCD0OCGSI1T9,B000GNOKQG,Big John,"[9, 40]","I really had looked forward to seeing a movie about the Maya, an exotic advanced, civilization living in the jungles of Mexico and Guatemala that had flourished and then mysteriously disappeared.  If you were like me and thought that the movie was named ""Apocalypto"" because it would be an epic about the demise of the Maya civilization, you were wrong.Problems with the movie:1. No indication when this takes place. The viewer would have no way of knowing if this was today in the Amazon jungle or 4000 years ago.  Only at the very end do you get any indication of the date of this movie.2. The movie has NO story.  The whole movie is just one long chase seen, with the main character defying unbelievable odds.3. Tons of blood and guts, killing, raping, and cruelty that will turn many people off.4. Predictable.  I guessed how the main character was going to not get sacrificed and what he would see at the end that would shock and save him.  (This final scene was hardly Charlton Heston at the end of Planet of the Apes).5. Historical and location inaccuracies.  The movie shows a 700 AD Classic Maya ceremonial center in Guatemala, but ends on the beach in 1530 Yucatan.  I could forgive these, if the movie was about something, more than a chase.6. Almost nothing about the Maya.  90% of this movie takes place in the jungle and not in the Mayan city.  We know the history of the Maya because their writing has been deciphered.  The Maya were such an interesting culture to do a movie about.  This was ancient Egypt in the jungle, ruled by warlike god-kings, with great pyramids, temples, irrigation works, and an exotic religion.  This could have been an epic movie, the ""Moses"" or ""Ben Hur"" of the jungle instead Gibson centers his movie on a poor village of hunters and gathers getting pillaged by the bad Maya.  This is like trying to make a ""Gone With the Wind"" and center the story around a family of poor tenant farmers.  Not very exciting stuff!Overall, bad movie, skip it.Does anyone know a good movie about the Maya written history?

1005577,A1TG903LLEH1N0,B000GNOKQG,"Bilbo Baggins ""mighty hobbit""","[3, 8]","I saw this movie in the theatres and I must say I enjoyed the action. The movie has a very epic, sweeping feel.  I imagine a lot of this gets lost in the translation to Dvd but If watched on a good television with surround sound then it should be almost as moving.  Watching the first part of the movie reminded me a lot of the movie Conan the barbarian where Conan's family and village gets wiped out and Conan becomes a slave.  To be sure, it's not quite the same in this movie.  The young man and his friends are being taken to be sacrificed but the theme is similar.  Evil raiding parties that attack the peaceful villages.  The raiding party itself isn't that bad, judging just on their behavior.  They jsut seem to be following orders.  The only really evil one is the second in command of the raiding party, a sly tricky fellow who dubs the hero with the name 'almost' because he almost killed him but didn't.  He was probably my favorite character in the movie.  My second favorite character was the hero's brother, the slightly bumbling yet devoted husband who couldn't seem to get his wife pregnant who sacrifices himself so his brother can escape.Anyway, thus begins a long march that takes the prisoners to the heart of the Mayan empire.  The main thing I took from the scenes in the city was the sense of decadence and lazy indulgence, which I guess was the point seeing this is about the fall of the Mayan civilization.  The last half of the movie with the young hero racing home to save his pregnant wife and son is the most 'action packed' part of the movie and reminds me of Rambo, the first one anyway with the hero setting clever traps that takes out his pursuer's.  Anyway, at the end of the movie Spanish ships appear signaling the end of civilization for the native people.  The idea being society wouldn't fall without being weakened by corruption and decadence.  It is a history lesson that has been repeated throughout time.The movie has a lot of violence and gore but it's not really any worse than Braveheart, another Mel Gibson film. If you can handle that then you will find the viewing experience of this movie quite enlightening.  Also, as a side note the movie is in the Mayan language so it has a sort of 'foreign' quality to it.  I reccomend this movie to anyone who likes good movies...and is mature enough to stomach seeing people get decapitated and impaled.",5,"Rambo meets Conan, sort of.",1180137600,"05 26, 2007",2007,2395,"['saw', 'movie', 'theatres', 'must', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'action', 'movie', 'very', 'epic', 'sweeping', 'feel', 'imagine', 'lot', 'lost', 'translation', 'Dvd', 'watched', 'good', 'television', 'surround', 'sound', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'almost', 'moving', 'Watching', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'reminded', 'lot', 'movie', 'Conan', 'barbarian', 'where', 'Conan', 'family', 'village', 'wiped', 'out', 'Conan', 'slave', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'movie', 'young', 'man', 'friends', 'are', 'being', 'taken', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'theme', 'similar', 'Evil', 'raiding', 'parties', 'attack', 'peaceful', 'villages', 'raiding', 'party', ""n't"", 'bad', 'judging', 'just', 'behavior', 'jsut', 'seem', 'be', 'following', 'orders', 'only', 'really', 'evil', 'one', 'second', 'command', 'raiding', 'party', 'sly', 'tricky', 'fellow', 'who', 'hero', 'name', 'almost', 'killed', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'probably', 'favorite', 'character', 'movie', 'second', 'favorite', 'character', 'was', 'hero', 'brother', 'slightly', 'bumbling', 'yet', 'devoted', 'husband', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'wife', 'pregnant', 'who', 'brother', 'can', 'escape.Anyway', 'thus', 'long', 'march', 'prisoners', 'heart', 'Mayan', 'empire', 'main', 'thing', 'took', 'scenes', 'city', 'was', 'sense', 'decadence', 'lazy', 'indulgence', 'guess', 'was', 'point', 'seeing', 'fall', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'last', 'half', 'movie', 'young', 'hero', 'racing', 'home', 'save', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'son', 'most', ""'action"", 'packed', 'part', 'movie', 'Rambo', 'first', 'one', 'anyway', 'hero', 'setting', 'clever', 'traps', 'out', 'pursuer', 'Anyway', 'end', 'movie', 'Spanish', 'ships', 'appear', 'signaling', 'end', 'civilization', 'native', 'people', 'idea', 'being', 'society', 'would', ""n't"", 'fall', 'being', 'weakened', 'corruption', 'decadence', 'history', 'lesson', 'been', 'repeated', 'time.The', 'movie', 'lot', 'violence', 'gore', 'not', 'really', 'worse', 'Braveheart', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'film', 'can', 'handle', 'then', 'will', 'find', 'viewing', 'experience', 'movie', 'quite', 'enlightening', 'Also', 'side', 'note', 'movie', 'Mayan', 'language', 'so', 'sort', ""'foreign"", 'quality', 'reccomend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'movies', 'mature', 'enough', 'stomach', 'seeing', 'people', 'get', 'decapitated', 'impaled']",N/A

1005581,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000GNOKQG,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[7, 10]","Love him or loathe him, Mel Gibson can make some damn good movies. BRAVEHEART was wonderfully brutal, which Gibson produced, directed and starred in. Now fully behind the camera in his latest two feature films, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST and now APOCALYPTO, Gibson proves he's got both vision and talent (now if he could only keep his personal life out of the tabloids!)Because of Mel's idiotic comments of late, many have seen fit (perhaps rightfully so) to boycott his films. I know I avoided seeing this one until it came out on DVD, a mini-boycott on my part for Mr. Gibson's poor politics and social skills. But the visuals on the trailers kept beckoning me to check out Apocalypto, and so I finally broke down and rented it.It is noteworthy here to say that Mel, regardless of subject matter, can pull viewers into a story. Although The Passion had its anti-Jewish components, it was sumptuously filmed and very well executed. If we're here to talk about films and not the man behind the film, then it's fair to say that Apocalypto is a rousing success.The sets, the dress, the make-up, the incredible story, and the action, all make this film a glue-yourself-to-the-screen experience. Not once did I pull my eyes from the movie, fearing that I might miss this beautiful shot or that amazing character.***SPOILER WARNING***The story is about Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), the future leader of a small band of people that live on the outskirts of the great Mayan culture. He has an ideal life, a loving wife, a tough son, and another kid ""in the oven."" He and his fellow townsfolk hunt the local forest for food and live in harmony with their environment. Until one day he and his tribe are ripped apart by beastly slave-gatherers. Realizing that he must hide his pregnant wife and son, Jaguar Paw lowers them into a deep pit for safe keeping during the slave runners attack. Caught, bound, and forced to march miles, Jaguar Paw and his tribesmen are brought to a great Mayan temple where they are to be sacrificed. But as Jaguar Paw's turn comes, a solar eclipse occurs and Jaguar and his remaining band are spared a barbarous beheading.But it ain't over yet.Taken to an open stadium, he and his surviving tribesfolk are told to run toward a field of corn as spears, rocks and other projectiles are hurled at them. At the end of the path, too, is a ""finisher"", the son of the head slave trader who kills off any of those who are wounded. Jaguar Paw, desperate to get back to his wife and child, kills the young finisher and escapes into the jungle. But the king of the slave-gatherers wants Jaguar Paw's blood for killing his son. And thus starts an adrenaline pumping chase through the thick jungle, over massive waterfalls, and deep into Jaguar Paw's country. Not only is Jaguar Paw running from the slave men, he's also running toward his beloved wife and kid in a race to save them before they either starve to death, get injured, or are drowned by flash-flood rains.***END SPOILERS***It is amazing that none of the main actors, supporting actors, or extras have any previous film history (at least not any significant history, really), yet they all played their parts perfectly. Much praise MUST (reluctantly or not) go toward Mr. Gibson for his amazing job directing this genre-busting thrill ride. Not only is it a pseudo-historical piece, but it also has heavy elements of romance, drama, comedy, and action/adventure. Rolling all of those concepts into one film is often impossible, but Apocalypto isn't forced nor overly drawn. It completely lures you in, including the Mayan language which is spoken throughout the entire production (with English subtitles).The make-up consisted of nearly 70 artists who had to re-tattoo each of the 700 main and extra characters daily, a monumental task. And costume designer Mayes C. Rubeo (BORN ON THE 4TH OF JULY) is to be commended for her outstanding head-dresses and eye to detail (I feel she was cheated out of an Academy Award nomination due to this film's affiliation with Mr. Gibson).So if you're thinking about watching this but don't like Mel Gibson personally, I totally understand.

Mr. Gibson drags out his favorite bits from Mad Max, The Passion of the Christ and his winner, Braveheart,and dresses his cast this time around, in pretty Tribal-Savage-Chic. He also manages to hunt down the greenest, lushest, most cinematic worthy natural forest for the over simplified drama to drag out in. There's plenty of atmosphere alright: you can hear every bird and insect in that overripe steamy jungle, taste the raw organs greedily devoured after a viciously brutal hunt and are repeatedly jolted by the ceremonial blood-centric violence in service to the Mayan gods. The lead, played by Native American Rudy Youngblood (as the super-humanly invincible warrior Jaguar Paw) is as elegantly movie-star handsome a 'savage' as any casting agent can find and paired with his exotically stunning wife and adorable baby son, makes for a mezmerising family (who are lit and filmed most glamorously even while under attack). Mr. Gibson chose to actually build the ancient Mayan city and temples on location as a nod to old-school Hollywood and also heavily researched the details of the ancient ritual heavy culture to ensure historic accuracy.The labor intensive costumes, oversized sets, hundreds of outrageously costumed extras and ceremonial details are impressive...but the few Disney-esque/cute-sy sequences involving CGI animals contrasts too much with the overall serious mood of Mr. Gibson's high speed and violent jungle action-drama. Unfortunately, the Disney-animated-like ""ferocious"" chief of the murderous tribal thugs who targets the hero,however,is way too overdone and looks more like an L.A. hairdresser out on the fetish-freak-party circuit than ruthless-evil personified. The subtitles lends an air of a documentary, but the spoken language is very flat & emotionless...and the bloody-screams after a while lose their effect. In the end,the romantic art direction and high speed action sequences wins over the weak story...but could make a cool video game for jaded suburban pre-teens with triple ADD!",2,Savage  Chic,1213401600,"06 14, 2008",2008,2336,"['fascinationg', 'see', 'silver', 'screen', 'decorated', 'almost', 'naked', 'exotically', 'beautiful', 'people', 'living', 'simple', 'jungle', 'life', 'when', 'not', 'taking', 'part', 'top', 'ancient', 'ceremonies', '.it', 'unfortunate', 'story', 'uninterestingly', 'predictable', 'very', 'tedious', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'eye', 'catching', 'Mr.', 'Gibson', 'out', 'favorite', 'bits', 'Mad', 'Max', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'winner', 'Braveheart', 'cast', 'time', 'around', 'pretty', 'Tribal-Savage-Chic', 'also', 'hunt', 'down', 'greenest', 'lushest', 'most', 'cinematic', 'worthy', 'natural', 'forest', 'over', 'simplified', 'drama', 'drag', 'out', 'plenty', 'atmosphere', 'alright', 'can', 'hear', 'bird', 'insect', 'overripe', 'steamy', 'jungle', 'taste', 'raw', 'organs', 'greedily', 'devoured', 'viciously', 'brutal', 'hunt', 'are', 'repeatedly', 'jolted', 'ceremonial', 'blood-centric', 'violence', 'service', 'Mayan', 'gods', 'lead', 'played', 'Native', 'American', 'Rudy', 'Youngblood', 'super-humanly', 'invincible', 'warrior', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'elegantly', 'movie-star', 'handsome', ""'savage"", 'casting', 'agent', 'can', 'find', 'paired', 'exotically', 'stunning', 'wife', 'adorable', 'baby', 'son', 'mezmerising', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'lit', 'filmed', 'most', 'glamorously', 'even', 'attack', 'Mr.', 'Gibson', 'chose', 'actually', 'build', 'ancient', 'Mayan', 'city', 'temples', 'location', 'nod', 'old-school', 'Hollywood', 'also', 'heavily', 'researched', 'details', 'ancient', 'ritual', 'heavy', 'culture', 'ensure', 'historic', 'accuracy.The', 'labor', 'intensive', 'costumes', 'oversized', 'sets', 'hundreds', 'outrageously', 'costumed', 'extras', 'ceremonial', 'details', 'are', 'impressive', 'few', 'Disney-esque/cute-sy', 'sequences', 'involving', 'CGI', 'animals', 'too', 'much', 'overall', 'serious', 'mood', 'Mr.', 'Gibson', 'high', 'speed', 'violent', 'jungle', 'action-drama', 'Unfortunately', 'Disney-animated-like', 'ferocious', 'chief', 'murderous', 'tribal', 'thugs', 'who', 'targets', 'hero', 'however', 'way', 'too', 'overdone', 'more', 'L.A.', 'hairdresser', 'out', 'fetish-freak-party', 'circuit', 'ruthless-evil', 'personified', 'subtitles', 'air', 'documentary', 'spoken', 'language', 'very', 'flat', 'emotionless', 'bloody-screams', 'while', 'lose', 'effect', 'end', 'romantic', 'art', 'direction', 'high', 'speed', 'action', 'sequences', 'weak', 'story', 'could', 'make', 'cool', 'video', 'game', 'jaded', 'suburban', 'pre-teens', 'triple', 'ADD']",N/A
1005586,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B000GNOKQG,Brian A. Schar,"[0, 1]","""Apocalypto"" is a well-shot movie that moves along at a fast clip.  Gibson wisely decided not to stretch this movie out into a 3+ hour epic, avoiding that temptation and keeping it just slightly flabby at about 2 hours 15 minutes.  There's nothing here story-wise you haven't seen before.  Imagine ""The Patriot"" in pre-Colombian Latin America, with the jungle dwellers as the colonists and the Mayans as the British, and you've hit about three quarters of the plot points of this movie.  It's not a bad film by any means, but it does keep reminding you of other movies you've seen before - just with a Yucutan flourish.I didn't care for the gross (pun intended) manipulativeness of the first act.  We know the Mayan city dwellers are bad people.  Whether they were human sacrificers in real life, I have no idea - I always thought it was the Aztecs that were the real bloodthirsty ones.  But the depredations suffered unto our heroic tribe were more than enough to make we the viewers cheer for revenge on the bad guys.  Of course, one could make a counter-argument that the first act simply shows the reality of brutal combat without romanticizing it, and I would be hard pressed to disagree.""Apocalypto"" is worth a rent, at least, if you don't mind some pretty brutal violence.",3,"Decent, if somewhat formulaic",1214265600,"06 24, 2008",2008,1279,"['Apocalypto', 'well-shot', 'movie', 'along', 'fast', 'clip', 'Gibson', 'wisely', 'decided', 'not', 'stretch', 'movie', 'out', '3+', 'hour', 'epic', 'avoiding', 'temptation', 'keeping', 'just', 'slightly', 'flabby', 'about', '2', 'hours', '15', 'minutes', 'nothing', 'here', 'story-wise', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'Imagine', 'Patriot', 'pre-Colombian', 'Latin', 'America', 'jungle', 'dwellers', 'colonists', 'Mayans', 'British', ""'ve"", 'hit', 'three', 'quarters', 'plot', 'points', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'means', 'keep', 'reminding', 'other', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'just', 'Yucutan', 'flourish.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'gross', 'pun', 'intended', 'manipulativeness', 'first', 'act', 'know', 'Mayan', 'city', 'dwellers', 'are', 'bad', 'people', 'were', 'human', 'sacrificers', 'real', 'life', 'have', 'idea', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'Aztecs', 'were', 'real', 'bloodthirsty', 'ones', 'depredations', 'suffered', 'heroic', 'tribe', 'were', 'more', 'enough', 'make', 'viewers', 'cheer', 'revenge', 'bad', 'guys', 'course', 'one', 'could', 'make', 'counter-argument', 'first', 'act', 'simply', 'reality', 'brutal', 'combat', 'romanticizing', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'disagree', 'Apocalypto', 'rent', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'pretty', 'brutal', 'violence']",N/A

1005588,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,B000GNOKQG,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[1, 2]","Sometimes its hard to separate a movie from the actions of its creator.Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is such a film. Many of the poor reviews of this film were based upon Gibson's racist comments rather than a reflection on the movie. For all the faults of its director Apocalypto is a fairly good straight foreward adventure story.The year is roughly 1502 and the Pre Columbian Mayan tribe of Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) seems to be doing pretty well in their jungle village away from the great Mayan cities. Jaguar Paw has a pregnant wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez) and a young son. One morning his village is attacked by the Holcane warriors led by Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo).The Holcane are destroying villages and taking prisoners to be used as slaves and sacrifices in a great Mayan city. The second act of the film details the death march to the city. Gibson's premise is that the great civilization was destroyed due to rot from the inside and this point is adequately made in the ultra violent sacrifice scenes in this section of the film.The third part of the film deals with Jaguar Paw's escape from the Holcane and his return to rescue his wife and young son. The third part of the film is pure action adventure. More like a cross between Rambo and Run Lola Run. This is pure adrenalin driven action and if you view it as such you won't be disappointed.See this film for the action and not for great social commentary and it's a pretty fair if often brutal adventure. I found myself liking the film far more than I thought I would.The disc includes a making of featurette, Becoming Mayan and a enjoyable commentary by Gibson and cowriter/producer Farhad Safinia.Rent it rather than buy unless ultra violence is your thing.",3,Mayan Adventure Film,1194825600,"11 12, 2007",2007,1726,"['Sometimes', 'hard', 'separate', 'movie', 'actions', 'creator.Mel', 'Gibson', 'Apocalypto', 'such', 'film', 'Many', 'poor', 'reviews', 'film', 'were', 'based', 'Gibson', 'racist', 'comments', 'rather', 'reflection', 'movie', 'faults', 'director', 'Apocalypto', 'fairly', 'good', 'straight', 'foreward', 'adventure', 'story.The', 'year', 'roughly', '1502', 'Pre', 'Columbian', 'Mayan', 'tribe', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'Rudy', 'Youngblood', 'be', 'doing', 'pretty', 'well', 'jungle', 'village', 'away', 'great', 'Mayan', 'cities', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'Seven', 'Dalia', 'Hernandez', 'young', 'son', 'One', 'morning', 'village', 'attacked', 'Holcane', 'warriors', 'led', 'Zero', 'Wolf', 'Raoul', 'Trujillo', '.The', 'Holcane', 'are', 'destroying', 'villages', 'taking', 'prisoners', 'be', 'used', 'slaves', 'sacrifices', 'great', 'Mayan', 'city', 'second', 'act', 'film', 'details', 'death', 'march', 'city', 'Gibson', 'premise', 'great', 'civilization', 'was', 'destroyed', 'due', 'rot', 'inside', 'point', 'adequately', 'made', 'ultra', 'violent', 'sacrifice', 'scenes', 'section', 'film.The', 'third', 'part', 'film', 'deals', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'escape', 'Holcane', 'return', 'rescue', 'wife', 'young', 'son', 'third', 'part', 'film', 'pure', 'action', 'adventure', 'More', 'cross', 'Rambo', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'pure', 'adrenalin', 'driven', 'action', 'view', 'such', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.See', 'film', 'action', 'not', 'great', 'social', 'commentary', 'pretty', 'fair', 'often', 'brutal', 'adventure', 'found', 'liking', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'thought', 'would.The', 'disc', 'making', 'featurette', 'Becoming', 'Mayan', 'enjoyable', 'commentary', 'Gibson', 'cowriter/producer', 'Farhad', 'Safinia.Rent', 'rather', 'buy', 'ultra', 'violence', 'thing']",N/A
1005589,ADES8B01WRPI3,B000GNOKQG,"Bryan E. Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[2, 5]","MEL GIBSON'S APOCALYPTO is a decent period piece. The costumes and sets, and scenery are great. The actors are very likable. The story is decent. It seems to teach something about ancient tribal life in South America, though many historical details have been protested against since the film was released. Although it is not as intense as I expected, it does have some nice family values displayed, among the main character and his family, which is an unexpected plus.The violence in APOCALYTPO is not as non-stop as I was led to believe from the hype and reviews when it was in theaters. Maybe I am too desensitized by more gratuitously violent films, like KILL BILL 1, (which I only saw once, due to it's wallowing in realistic cartoon violence, though it was a cleverly made film by Quentin Tarantino).Kill Bill, Volume 1Compared to Mel Gibson's most successful masterpiece movie, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, the violence in APOCALYPTO is a lot less non-stop than in the movie about the crucifixion of Jesus Christ! Unfortunately, the action level in APOCALYPTO is a bit low, too. THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST did not need action, since it had very intense religious content. APOCALYPTO doesn't have any weighty religious subject matter to hold the audience's interest, so it really needs action to be entertaining.The Passion of the Christ (Definitive Edition)I thought APOCALYPTO was a Chase movie, but the chase doesn't really begin until the last 30 minutes of the film, though it is this movie's best part, and too quickly over, in my opinion.The film starts with 25 minutes of friendly village life, which is sometimes too contemporary, (in the way of dirty joke humor). This is distracting and takes away from the exotic mystery and feel of watching a primitive tribe, hundreds of years ago. In the Director's Commentary, they explain that these ancient people had a carnal language and disposition, even to the point of using the equivalent of the F-word, in the subtitles, at one point. Apparently Mel Gibson thought having the characters act coarse, doing dirty practical jokes, and cussing in the subtitles would make this film more accurate to the characters. If they say so, I guess, but I found it distracting until they explained this aspect of the film and writing.The bad guys are then introduced as fighting ensues, and then the middle bulk of the film is all marching through the jungle and arriving in an ancient South American city where human sacrifices are being conducted to appease their pagan god. This middle section of the film is okay, and they make it look interesting with the jungle scenery and the ancient city life, but it is low on action. It does manage to look and feel very exotic, which is entertaining and mysterious, though not too exciting.The best part of the film is when our hero breaks free and is chased through the jungle, back to his village, with the bad guys in hot pursuit, but now, unlike the long and slow march from the village, our hero is free from his bonds and can attempt to fight back at the bad guys. The run back to the village goes twice as fast as the march away, so it seems like the village wasn't that far away from the evil city, after all, and the chase seems to end too soon, because of that. It also makes it seem like a gap in logic that our hero's village never realized the danger of the violent citizens from the big city nearby!Many native, non-actors were used, and unfortunately it sometimes shows with the more minor characters, despite that most of the actors are very likable, many are not very good at hiding that they are, indeed, acting for a movie camera. If you have ever mugged into a home video camera, hamming it up for your friends and cracking up laughing after pretending to be serious, then you might recognize some of the actors doing that in quite a few scenes. They should be wearing a serious look for the whole scene, but instead they get a betraying, wide-eyed smile that they seem to be holding back, waiting for the director to yell ""Cut!""There is a mildly controversial scene when characters witness the arrival of the white man on their shores, carrying the Christian cross to symbolize the arrival of Christianity (I suppose), and the natives run away from them, preferring the jungle over Christian civilization (as the controversy was stated). I don't mind this scene because, even though I can see how one could easily recognize this subtle message, I am not entirely convinced that an anti-Christian message is the intent of the scene. It could just as easily be about anti-western values, not just against Christian values. No mild controversy is warranted by this scene in my opinion. Actually, I think the scene makes perfect sense in that the natives are wary and suspicious of outsiders and foreigners, after all that they had gone through in APOCALYPTO, before this scene. So, to me, it seems more like a joke than a statement on multiculturalism. Whatever was meant or perceived, in the Director's Commentary Mel Gibson says this was the first scene that he envisioned before starting work on the film, and it was supposed to be like a funny incident that the bad guys are so surprised by the sight of the foreigners that they are immediately distracted from the chase!I think it is strange that Mel Gibson made this movie next, after his best, most famous and successful film, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST. It seems to me that Mel got the wrong idea about why THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST was a huge hit. He seems to have thought that making an historical story, in a foreign land, using ancient languages, and including very graphic violence, was the ""formula"" for the success of THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, instead of its great interest by Christians around the globe, who had never seen a film as intense as THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, as a Bible movie. I wish he would have made a prequel or sequel to THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST! Oh, well.The DVD bonuses are decent. Mel gives a good director's commentary track with his friend, the producer/co-writer, which is especially good in explaining the events and scenes in the big city and the rituals and activities of the ancient people. They say that the real life people were actually more violent than what is portrayed in the human sacrifices scene. The Making Of documentary is the usual stuff, but it is only about 30 minutes long. There is only one deleted scene, even though in the director's commentary Mel mentions that he shot a longer scene of a baby being taken from its mother in the village raid, but they thought it was too extreme, (for THIS movie, APOCALYPTO?).Overall, this film is pretty good entertainment, and it gets more enjoyable for me after going through the bonus features. Upon repeated viewings, I like the movie more and more.Some of the scenes and situations are actually pretty clever, classic type film situations, where the danger and stakes increase as fast as the time is running out to succeed!Many of my friends are lined up to borrow my DVD of APOCALYPTO, so that is worth buying this DVD for, too, since folks are curious about this film and it is fun to share with your friends!If you are intrigued by primitive tribal life in South America, I can recommend BEYOND THE GATES OF SPLENDOR on DVD, which is a documentary of a famous, real life murder of three Christian missionaries trying to evangelize a dangerous, primitive tribe in South America, in the 1950s.Beyond the Gates of Splendor",4,"Graphic Violence Not as Extreme as Expected, but Not as

When they are on top of the temple about to be...WOW!!Too bad Mel got himself in trouble when he did, this movie would have been much bigger, and it deserved to be much bigger. He is fearless as a moviemaker, which often provokes some hypocritical criticism, e.g. his movies are too violent, yet these same people will go ga-ga over a Tarantino movie and will remain silent about the endless stream of horror/torture movies that seem to come out every weekend.Whether you like his movies or not, Gibson goes the extra mile to make a mature, realistic, entertaining, and somewhat educational movie, instead of a typical hollywood production aimed at teenagers.

1005594,A21VGNU5959O85,B000GNOKQG,CaterpillarGirl,"[5, 9]","The best filmmakers are the ones who aren't afraid to coat their projects with their own life blood. There are films that you see that you just KNOW it's a window into the soul of the writer or director, and you are grateful they had the guts to do it. Mel Gibson has always taken his fervor, vivacity, creativity and devotion to his work seriously. He has produced and directed such films as: Man without a Face, Forever Young, Braveheart, Passion of the Christ, and Apocalypto. All of those films have personally left me with a sense of wonderment, curiosity, awe and self awareness. Mel, as we know, has issues but unlike some people he admits it and is getting help (sober for 3 months!). I grew up with an alcoholic, so I know the ups and downs and the inner turmoil they feel, we are lucky as an audience to witness Mel's way of hashing out his inner demons. I personally don't know one person on the face of the earth who can judge Mel, we all have had moments or knew someone who did, and we all deserve forgiveness and understanding.Onto the reviewApocalypto is an astonishing, breathtaking tale of one man and his devotion to both his family, and his way of life. Jaguar Paw is everyman. A father, husband, son, and warrior.Who among us could imagine his way of life and the hard work it takes to provide for a village and family, and who among us wouldn't trade all we have to experience that sense of accomplishment and utter bliss. When he sees another warrior, who has been displaced by an unknown ravager, he senses his fear and it worries him. His own father says to him that once fear sets into your brain it takes over, and you can't let that happen. That is the truth; a lot of us live with some kind of fear and it consumes our lives to the point where any happiness we feel is fleeting. Jaguar Paw sleeps in a hut, but has a beautiful family and he is content. When a tribe of warriors comes to desecrate their village and kidnap the men and women, he experiences great loss and feels the fear his father spoke of envelope his whole being. He saves his family, only to leave them in a precarious position and he knows that he has to get back to them somehow.The evil in this movie turns out to be a city of excess populated by the sick and the depraved and the greedy. A ruler who wants bigger buildings, who demands human sacrifice to satiate the Gods, and in turn their crops will grow again and the diseased will be healed. It's a town where human waste runs through the streets, and the people are idle and do nothing but sit around and use the resources, and where the value of a human life is an afterthought to the sport of the game and wicked morbid amusement. It is a society that is doomed and we all know it as soon as we see it through Jaguar Paws eyes. Gibson clearly is saying here that a great civilization cannot not exist on such wastefulness of youth, resources, and decadence.Jaguar Paw has a mission to get back to his family and because of circumstances and sheer willpower gets free and starts heading back to them, followed by the same warriors who kidnapped him. They are weary of him because of some prophecy but decide to still go after him because of revenge and pride.  He is wounded but manages to outwit, outlast and draw upon strength of character that none of them have. He is a man while they are merely semblances of men parading around in finery, their brains empty and hearts full of hate and greed. In the end he succeeds in saving his family, and witnesses the coming of a new enemy with the Spaniards landing on their beach. Instead of investigating the newcomers he vanishes into the jungle determined to start over anew, a spark of independence and preservation for his way of life still alight.My husband and I left the theater and talked for about two hours about what message we got from Apocalypto. Why can't people be happy with what they have? Are we as a society now dependent on too much technology and not enough on the skills it takes to survive without. Is the family unit a thing of the past, Are we all too wasteful and ignoring the lessons of many civilizations that have gone before? Do we let fear rule our lives, the fear of bills and jobs and traffic and gossip. Do we know our priorities in life, and is the number one thing ourselves? Are we too selfish, do we have a tribe we can depend on? Do we listen to our elders?I would tell anyone to see this movie, over the age of 17 of course, it does have violence but not for the sake of shock. I thought CSI shows worse that this movie did!

1005598,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000GNOKQG,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 8]","In relation to his film ""Apocalypto,"" Mel Gibson is quoted as saying, ""The precursors to a civilization that's going under are the same, time and time again ..."" I completely understood this statement as I left the theater; no matter where you live, no matter what your circumstances in life, no matter how ""civilized"" or ""primitive"" a culture, a society is still vulnerable to decline. What makes all the difference is whether or not it comes from within. This is the very idea the film is founded on, focusing on two different tribes of the Mayan civilization engaged in conflict. It raises some questions: would the Ancient Mayans have continued to prosper had they not been in turmoil? Would they have been able to resist the Spanish invasion if they were united instead of divided? These underlying themes of change made this one of the most unique experiences I've had at the movies.The word ""apocalypto"" is derived from Greek, translating as ""I reveal."" Many things are appropriately revealed is this film, most notably the fact that the basic human instincts of survival, love, fear, and hatred are universal; despite the exotic locals and the intense action, I felt a connection with the main characters that transcended such details. The story primarily focuses on Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), a young Mayan hunter living peacefully in a village with his pregnant wife, Seven (Dalia Hernandaz), and his little boy, Turtles Run (Carlos Emilio Baez). One morning, the village is brutally invaded by a warrior tribe. It's a nasty sight to behold: women are beaten and raped; children are forcefully dragged away; more than a couple of throats are slit. The physically capable adults are bound together, ready to be taken back to the opposing tribe's village.Jaguar Paw is one such captive. Luckily, he manages to save his wife and child by lowering them into a cave, one with many nooks and crannies for hiding. While the audience has no way of knowing how the situation will unfold, they still get the feeling that he knows he'll return for them. We certainly hope that that will be the case, especially when the opposing city is finally revealed. In this bustling metropolis: we see powder-coated slaves building massive structures; we see women being sold at auction; we see the men being painted blue; we see severed heads rolling down the steps of a looming pyramid serving as a sacrificial alter. Jaguar Paw is one of many captives scheduled for this fate, supposedly in the belief that their deaths will appease the gods and bring an end to a widespread famine. As he watches his companions' hearts being ripped out and heads being chopped off, he realizes something: he's not yet ready to go.Almost as soon as he comes to this realization, the solar eclipse darkens the sky, meaning that the gods' thirst for blood has been quenched (or so they would like to believe). Already, the more suspicious tribe members consider it the first sign of a prophecy, one described earlier by a little girl stricken with smallpox. This was the one scene in the entire film I had trouble understanding, despite the fact that it was a very effective scene; we first see her as a lonely soul who only wants some comfort. But after she's shunned for being ill, she starts spouting warnings as if she were a fortuneteller. She says that doom will follow the darkness of the sun, and that the man who runs with the jaguar will meet with a dark fate. I wondered whether or not this character was intended to be the creepy predictor of bad events; that seems a little too convenient for the plot.Still, she adds a nice touch of mystery to the story, and her warnings serve as perfect counterpoints to the inevitable chase sequence between Jaguar Paw and members of the rival tribe. At that point, the film becomes a full-blown action picture, full of heart pounding stunts and dangerous encounters (namely with a mother jaguar attempting to protect her cub). It's actually quite exciting to watch, considering Seven and Turtles Run are still waiting at the bottom of a cave. In order to reach his family, Jaguar Paw has to be quick, cunning, and merciless, pretty much to the point of becoming the enemy. Here's an interesting parallel: in order to return to the peaceful life he once knew, he has behave in ways that are anything but peaceful.Again, the theme of change is alluded to, and it's made implicitly clear by the arrival of the conquistador ships. Whether or not Jaguar Paw survives his ordeal, whether or not his family will pull through, it's obvious that nothing will ever be the same; it's a new beginning. Subtler images reinforce this idea, such as the birth of Jaguar Paw's second son in the midst of a flood (brought on by a torrential rainstorm). It seemed to me that ""Apocalypto"" was intentionally meant to be symbolic, with less attention devoted to story. But don't get the wrong idea; a definite story is being told. However, it's so basic that it's easily overshadowed by the thematic elements. At its core, it's a Daring Escape fable. But it's surrounded by a wealth of more complex ideas, specifically humanistic ones. This was a wise move on Mel Gibson's part; he's crafted a genuinely intriguing film, rich in detail and integrity.",5,All Good Things Must Have a New Beginning,1166227200,"12 16,

1005600,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000GNOKQG,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 4]","Just like Tom Cruise's weird celebrity escapades before the releases of War of the Worlds and Mission: Impossible III, Mel Gibson and his film Apocalypto wasn't immune to controversy. A big budget film using ancient language subtitles and not a single recognizable face in the bunch, many wondered if Gibson was off his rocker. While not given the large attention that the Passion of the Christ got, this is at least an enjoyable film that won't really change your life or do anything significant, but you'll have fun anyway...if you can stomach this kind of thing.Set during an unspecified date, we see a group of Mayans living in a remote village in the jungle. One day, a savage group attacks their camp and those that aren't killed are enslaved and traveled a great distance to a Mayan city where some are sold off and others are sacrificed. Among the captured is Jaguar Paw, a young man with a son and pregnant wife at home (she was hid during the initial attack). He manages to escape and he sets off back home while being chased by a group of warriors looking to have his head.The main issue (aside from the obvious religious stuff) with the Passion was the amount of violence it had. Some saw it as a representation of Jesus dying for your sins and if he was going to, he better go through hell to forgive everyone's while others saw the violence as gratuitious and almost quasi-sadistic. Unlike certain films with big violence such as Hostel, the violence here serves the story and is part of it rather than is the story. But still, when you see not one but 2 people getting their hearts ripped out than subsequently decapitated, you kinda go ""hm, kinda excessive no?""The film is basically separated in 2: a more slower paced view of Mayan culture, complete with odd face paintings and scars. It's interesting although you can imagine how odd it looks to see sticks through people's noses. The second half though is essentially one big long chase through the jungle with Jungle Paw outrunning his captives and even turning the tables on them. We got many many scenes of him just running which could be a great advertisement for a new diet. (""Wanna lose weight fast? Do a Mel Gibson movie""). But instead of being a Michael Bay scene of just action for the sake of showing off effects and mayhem, this serves as a purpose as he has to get back to his wife who is due any minute and the fact that she is stuck in a hole and can easily drown should it rain doesn't help matters. Some enjoy both halves together while the majority will just look at the chase and go ""cool dude!""While it won't go into the collective conscious that Passion of the Christ did, it's at least an enjoyable movie for those who like some emotion with their action.",4,An exciting epic that may not be for everyone,1179878400,"05 23, 2007",2007,2745,"['Just', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'weird', 'celebrity', 'escapades', 'releases', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'III', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'film', 'Apocalypto', 'was', ""n't"", 'immune', 'controversy', 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'using', 'ancient', 'language', 'subtitles', 'not', 'single', 'recognizable', 'face', 'bunch', 'many', 'wondered', 'Gibson', 'was', 'rocker', 'not', 'given', 'large', 'attention', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'got', 'least', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'change', 'life', 'do', 'anything', 'significant', ""'ll"", 'have', 'fun', 'anyway', 'can', 'stomach', 'kind', 'thing.Set', 'unspecified', 'date', 'see', 'group', 'Mayans', 'living', 'remote', 'village', 'jungle', 'One', 'day', 'savage', 'group', 'camp', 'are', ""n't"", 'killed', 'are', 'enslaved', 'traveled', 'great', 'distance', 'Mayan', 'city', 'where', 'are', 'sold', 'off', 'others', 'are', 'sacrificed', 'captured', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'young', 'man', 'son', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'home', 'was', 'hid', 'initial', 'attack', 'escape', 'off', 'back', 'home', 'being', 'chased', 'group', 'warriors', 'looking', 'have', 'head.The', 'main', 'issue', 'aside', 'obvious', 'religious', 'stuff', 'Passion', 'was', 'amount', 'violence', 'had', 'saw', 'representation', 'Jesus', 'dying', 'sins', 'was', 'going', 'better', 'go', 'hell', 'forgive', 'everyone', 'others', 'saw', 'violence', 'gratuitious', 'almost', 'quasi-sadistic', 'certain', 'films', 'big', 'violence', 'such', 'Hostel', 'violence', 'here', 'story', 'part', 'rather', 'story', 'still', 'when', 'see', 'not', 'one', '2', 'people', 'getting', 'hearts', 'ripped', 'out', 'subsequently', 'decapitated', 'kinda', 'go', 'hm', 'kinda', 'excessive', 'film', 'basically', 'separated', '2', 'more', 'slower', 'paced', 'view', 'Mayan', 'culture', 'complete', 'odd', 'face', 'paintings', 'scars', 'interesting', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'odd', 'see', 'sticks', 'people', 'noses', 'second', 'half', 'though', 'essentially', 'one', 'big', 'long', 'chase', 'jungle', 'Jungle', 'Paw', 'outrunning', 'captives', 'even', 'turning', 'tables', 'got', 'many', 'many', 'scenes', 'just', 'running', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'advertisement', 'new', 'diet', 'Wan', 'lose', 'weight', 'fast', 'Do', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'movie', 'instead', 'being', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'scene', 'just', 'action', 'sake', 'showing', 'off', 'effects', 'mayhem', 'purpose', 'get', 'back', 'wife', 'who', 'due', 'minute', 'fact', 'stuck', 'hole', 'can', 'easily', 'drown', 'should', 'rain', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'enjoy', 'halves', 'together', 'majority', 'will', 'just', 'look', 'chase', 'go', 'cool', 'dude', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'collective', 'conscious', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'did', 'least', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'who', 'like', 'emotion', 'action']",N/A

1005602,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000GNOKQG,Craig Matteson,"[0, 1]","I was surprised that I ended up enjoying this movie more than I had expected I would.  Yes, there are some gruesome scenes of violence, but nothing as awful as it could have been.  The worst is seeing a jaguar chew on a mans face while killing him, or the heads bouncing down and the headless corpses rolling down the steps of the temple (as was done by the Maya).  The cutting out of the hearts is actually worse in ""Temple of Doom"".Still, the level of savagery is quite high.  The life of the Maya was harsh and filled with war and violence.  I believe it was far worse than is depicted in this film.  Certainly, the life of women would have been far harsher than the near equality they are given in this story.  Maybe another reason for the ""R"" rating is that the dress of the Maya is pretty much as you see it on the murals without any attempt to cover things to our comparatively modest standards.The story is about a man who is part of a small village deep in the forest.  For them this was the good life.  Another group of people asks for passage through their land because their village was ravaged.  I do not believe that they would not have exchanged information about what happened, but they don't talk to each other here.  I hate it when a plot point depends on someone not saying something or asking something obviously important.Along come the warriors from the big city in their fierce dress.  They slaughter and take captive the entire village, including our hero, Jaguar Paw.  We have gotten to know most of the central people in this village so this event is quite powerful.  Jaguar Paw works frantically to hide his pregnant wife and son and then goes to help fight for his people.  He is taken captive and marched to the city.  I appreciated the cruelty and indifference to life shown here.  Again, if anything, I think it was more mild than real life probably was for these people.He and his people are not destined for slavery, but for sacrifice.  I will leave you to watch the movie to find out what happens.  However, this movie is set immediately before the Spaniards arrive.  I mean immediately.The dialogue is in Mayan (I guess, I don't speak Mayan so I can't tell you for sure) with subtitles.  There is really not much dialogue so it is quite easy to follow and what little reading there is comes quite naturally after a few minutes.While certainly not for everyone, and not even young teens, it is a decent film.  Not everything is historically accurate, but I certainly found it interesting to see the people in the Mayan murals come to life in their dress, hairstyles, weapons, forest habitat, cruelty, and ignorance.  I particularly noticed how power was tightly held to the few over the many.  The one real flaw I saw in the film was that the people in the forest seemed unaware of the big city.  However, if you read about the Spanish Conquest, it is amazing how fast news spread and how efficient the information systems were.  And given how important information about people who could destroy you is, I think they would have known everything about the city and its people and intentions towards them.",4,"Interesting to see the dress, but life would have been even more cruel",1180396800,"05 29, 2007",2007,3138,"['was', 'surprised', 'ended', 'up', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'more', 'had', 'expected', 'would', 'Yes', 'are', 'gruesome', 'scenes', 'violence', 'nothing', 'as', 'awful', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'worst', 'seeing', 'jaguar', 'chew', 'mans', 'face', 'killing', 'heads', 'bouncing', 'down', 'headless', 'rolling', 'down', 'steps', 'temple', 'was', 'done', 'Maya', 'cutting', 'hearts', 'actually', 'worse', 'Temple', 'Doom', '.Still', 'level', 'savagery', 'quite', 'high', 'life', 'Maya', 'was', 'harsh', 'filled', 'war', 'violence', 'believe', 'was', 'far', 'worse', 'depicted', 'film', 'Certainly', 'life', 'women', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'harsher', 'near', 'equality', 'are', 'given', 'story', 'Maybe', 'reason', 'R', 'rating', 'dress', 'Maya', 'pretty', 'much', 'see', 'murals', 'attempt', 'cover', 'things', 'comparatively', 'modest', 'standards.The', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'part', 'small', 'village', 'deep', 'forest', 'was', 'good', 'life', 'group', 'people', 'asks', 'passage', 'land', 'village', 'was', 'ravaged', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'exchanged', 'information', 'what', 'happened', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'other', 'here', 'hate', 'when', 'plot', 'point', 'someone', 'not', 'saying', 'something', 'asking', 'something', 'obviously', 'important.Along', 'come', 'warriors', 'big', 'city', 'fierce', 'dress', 'slaughter', 'take', 'captive', 'entire', 'village', 'including', 'hero', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'have', 'gotten', 'know', 'most', 'central', 'people', 'village', 'so', 'event', 'quite', 'powerful', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'frantically', 'hide', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'son', 'then', 'help', 'fight', 'people', 'taken', 'captive', 'marched', 'city', 'appreciated', 'cruelty', 'indifference', 'life', 'shown', 'here', 'Again', 'anything', 'think', 'was', 'more', 'mild', 'real', 'life', 'probably', 'was', 'people.He', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'destined', 'slavery', 'sacrifice', 'will', 'leave', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'However', 'movie', 'set', 'immediately', 'Spaniards', 'arrive', 'mean', 'immediately.The', 'dialogue', 'Mayan', 'guess', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Mayan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'sure', 'subtitles', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'dialogue', 'quite', 'easy', 'follow', 'what', 'little', 'reading', 'quite', 'naturally', 'few', 'minutes.While', 'certainly', 'not', 'everyone', 'not', 'even', 'young', 'teens', 'decent', 'film', 'Not', 'everything', 'historically', 'accurate', 'certainly', 'found', 'interesting', 'see', 'people', 'Mayan', 'murals', 'come', 'life', 'dress', 'hairstyles', 'weapons', 'forest', 'habitat', 'cruelty', 'ignorance', 'particularly', 'noticed', 'how', 'power', 'was', 'tightly', 'held', 'few', 'many', 'one', 'real', 'flaw', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'people', 'forest', 'seemed', 'unaware', 'big', 'city', 'However', 'read', 'Spanish', 'Conquest', 'amazing', 'how', 'fast', 'news', 'spread', 'how', 'efficient', 'information', 'systems', 'were', 'given', 'how', 'important', 'information', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'destroy', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'everything', 'city', 'people', 'intentions', 'towards']",N/A

It starts with this quote""A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within.""It begins in a small jungle village where the people are strong, healthy, family oriented. Then they are captured by a different Mayan tribe in a raid and taken to their city which shows what a rotting society they have. You begin to see decadence, many people are physically fat and deformed, stealing, gluttony, people being enslaved, corrupt lying con artist type leaders, etc. I mean it really is a mesoamerican version of America.You also have a very politically incorrect view of the Mayan Indians. Besides the sickness that is their rotting civilization it also shows the utter violent cruelty that these people indulge in. Many of the politically correct have howled about Apocalytpo.Almost all of Mels movies show someone standing up to corrupt governments in a brave noble way. There is a theme of not succuming to fear and allowing it to dictate how you live your life in most of his films also. This guy makes great movies.

I mean it's heart-rending if you're one of the prisoners that get hauled back to Tikal, painted bright blue, marched up the blood-soaked steps of some Mayan Temple, has his heart ripped out by the deranged & happy high priest of the Bat God, has his head lopped off, and for the cherry on top gets his headless corpses lobbed back down the ziggurat, way faster than he came up!APOCA-SHORTO REVIEW: if you're looking for immersive, bracing, & gorgeous, look no further than ""Apocalypto"", which convinced me American society is seriously missing that little something extra. That Little Something Extra being heart-ripping sacrifices. You know, for a good cause, like, uh, combating global warming. Check it out.APOCA-LONGO REVIEW: To ascend to the top of the blood-drenched, gore-caked stone steps of the cinematic ziggurat of zaniness that is Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"", it's necessary to step back a bit, take a deep breath, put down that enemy warrior's heart, drop the statue of Camazotz, and listen up: you gotta get down with Mad Mal first!What do I mean by that? I mean, quite simply, that Mel's work has always orbited, well, Mel. Each of us is a work in progress (except for liberals, who are spat forth pristine & perfect from their mama's hairpouch), but the fun thing about Mel Gibson is how we can relate the Man to his Movies. Consider the Evolution of Mel:Pulp Fiction Mel: the rangy, handsome Australian actor with a very identifiable Aussie accent, the lone wolf set against the arid, apocalyptic Outback of ""Mad Max"" and the ""Road Warrior"".Big Budget Mel: here Mel got some Jesus. Wait, that came later. Here, Mel got some Big Budget Hollywood. He played the Edgy, Crazy, Suicidal, Hair-Trigger .45-eating cop in ""Lethal Weapon"", ying to Danny Glover's yang. Happily Mel metamorphosed into something interesting, whereas Glover is know to whine about not being able to get a cab ride in Manhattan.Serious Actor Mel: Serious! Thespian! Mel! Yes! Mel walked the boards as the most somber Prince, which gave him some heft and gravitas---and set him on the weird, somber, intriguing art which catapulted him into the bosom of Quetzalcoatl---without forcing him to find himself balding, poor, and wrinkled, and still having to walk the boards as, I dunno, Polonius, at age 67.Director Mel: look, man, it's cool to be a Star: you've got, well I dunno, swimming pools. And Bel-Air. And 12-Martini lunches with production dudes. And mountains of coke on glass tables. And Spago! And LA's own Adam's Rib (for Stars): Star-Lets. But it gets old having to bow & scrape before old hairy (Jewish) crabby angry balding hideously wealthy (Jewish) movie producers.So Mel turned out the poigant ""Man without a Face"", blew everybody away with ""Braveheart"", and really switched it up with ""Passion of the Christ"", essentially a snuff film featuring Jesus. Word.Dead Languages Director Mel: Dead Languages=Serious Business. OK, I cheated. ""Passion"" counts here; so does 'Apocalypto'. I hear his next is gonna be shot using English in LA.And thus we come to MAD MEL yet again, only this time he's not walking the irradiated badlands of Australia firing shells at biker punks, but crawling and puking along the side of the Pacific Coast Highway, snarling epithets at Jews.Anyway, ""Apocalypto"" is Mad Mel as Montezuma's revenge! It's a gore-caked period piece chock full of hungry jaguars, nekkid chicks, nekkid ziggurats, nekkid high priests with old man bajoobalies, a wife in a well, a rugrat in a well, extra-curricular cruel contests on the Pelota fields, and blood sacrifice.It's even shot in ancient Mayan, which heightens the authenticity. I mean, imagine if Jaguar Paw was emoting in, say, San Fernando Valleyspeak? Wouldn't be the same. Besides, being shot in Mayan makes it more accessible to the largely Mayan audience watching it. Domo Arigato Mr. Apocalypto!Don't get me wrong: it's an astonishing creation. For me, though, I think it was astonishing for the wrong reason: for hours thereafter I was in a kind of weird fugue or reverie, imagining myself clad in parrot feathers and a surplice of human ears and tongues, and a crown made of an ocelot's jaw, my body painted, an avatar of Camazotz, tearing out the hearts of my sacrifices!Sorry, where was I? Oh yeah, the story.""Apocalypto"" tells the story of Jaguar Paw and his family, who live a life of near Edenic tranquility hunting the lands Paw's forefathers hunted for generations, until a bunch of nasty, smelly, greedy Jews come along and ruin everything!Just kidding. Actually, Paw & Fils get dragooned by a Mayan hunting party (who took the injunction ""BYOB"" to a whole new level) and frogmarched to Tikal for fun and games. Actually, very little fun. Or games. Primarily Death.And so we follow Jaguar Paw and his captured tribe to the great Mayan temple city, where the Mayans are living with each other, and the Earth Mother, in harmony, save for the occasional heart ripping sacrifice---ah, multiculturalism!---until a band of nasty, smelly, greedy Jews come along and ruin it for everybody.OK, kidding. Anyway, just like ""Passion"", ""Apocalypto"" is spare, brooding, beautiful, and complete in itself. Director Mel has some magic in his fingers & in his camera lens.And more to the point: Apocalypto demonstrates that while Man in the state of Nature may not be nasty, brutal & short, Man in the state of Civilization often means having to wear your Heart on your sleeve.Literally.JSG",5,Bungle in the Jungle,1190937600,"09 28, 2007",2007,5582,"['Mel', 'Gibson', 'feral', 'little', 'fever-dream',

1005607,A27FR2C67JPDRS,B000GNOKQG,Daryl B,"[5, 9]","First, I'm gonna start by declaring that I'm not a big fan of Mel Gibson (as a person).  That being said, after seeing the trailer for this film at the theater, I knew I had to see it.The story focuses on Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), a young man who has a happy life----a member of a close knit village of family and friends.  Soon, however, his world is destroyed by Mayan invaders who attack the village, capturing the adults (the ones who are not slaughtered) and leaving behind the children to die.  Before he is caught, Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and son in a deep cravass but is soon herded off to a great Mayan city for a dreadful fate, uncertain of what will become of his young family.Once inside the huge city, the captives see slaves laboring to build the ever expanding city and crowds cheering, hungry for blood.  The women are sold off and the men, it is soon learned, are destined to be sacrificed to a Mayan god.Fate leads Jaguar Paw away from death and gives him a chance to return to his home and possibly save his family who remain stranded underground.  What follows is a frantic chase, with captors at his heels, as a young man uses his wits (and blessed by good luck at times) to escape the evil that is closing in on him.Gibson managed to make a fast past movie that gives us a glimpse into the mysteries of the Mayan civiliztion.  He also gives us a parting glance at a culture that is dying and at the start of its decline.  The scenes of the peaceful village being attacked and sheperded into slavery are hard to watch and you will find yourself desperately hoping that these poor people will somehow manage to escape their horrific destinies.  While the ending of the movie leaves room for optimism, it also shows us that one evil can easily be replaced by another, more powerful evil.The film is spoken entirely in the Mayan language (with English subtitles) but don't be put off by this.  The story moves along quickly and the action is well paced.  The lead, Rudy Youngblood, does an excellent job as the man who's life is forever changed but is determined to save his wife and child.A worthy addition to any dvd collection!

1005610,A31NE5DL1EVTFC,B000GNOKQG,"David OBrien ""Powerpop lover""","[6, 9]","This is another classic from Mel Gibson - it's much more in the mould of Braveheart than Passion Of The Christ. Similar to Braveheart, the theme is an individual who is wronged and goes out to get the perpetrators.The cast are all unknown and the film is all done in the Yakutan Mayan ancient language. It is totally subtitled.The main theme of the film is the capture of a Mayan tribe by rivals. The main character Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and child in a cave before seeing his father executed and taken captive. The rest of the villagers are either executed or taken captive to a neighbouring village. The children are left behind. The women are auctioned as slaves and the men are taken for sacrifice to the local pyramid to appease the Sun God. Jaguar Paw watches as several of his colleagues have their heart cut out and are beheaded in a ritual. He is next up but he is saved from this terrible death by a solar eclipse. The sacrifices stop because the local shamen thinks that the sun gods are now pleased. Jaguar Paw and the other men are taken away to be ""disposed of"". While the rest of the men are executed during a cruel game of 'cat and mouse' in a corn field, a wounded Jaguar Paw kills the son of the chief of the tribe and escapes back into the jungle. He is pursued by about ten men who are going to try and kill him. He must try and return to his wife and child and evade capture.The film contains some beautiful cinematographery and some of the scenery is breathtaking - especially the ancient Mayan costumes, the waterfall, the jungle and the animals. However, the film is also exceptionally gory and violent. I think it's justified in this case. This was a non-Christian society where sacrifice and pillage were the norm.At the back of it all, this film is a good,old-fashioned tale of good versus evil. It's a chase movie without the fast cars. However, it does hold the viewers attention throughout and contains some terrific scenes.The buckets of blood might put a lot of people off but not me...I thought it added to the tension",5,Magnificent...but extremely violent,1174348800,"03 20, 2007",2007,2073,"['classic', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'much', 'more', 'mould', 'Braveheart', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'Similar', 'Braveheart', 'theme', 'individual', 'who', 'wronged', 'out', 'get', 'perpetrators.The', 'cast', 'are', 'unknown', 'film', 'done', 'Yakutan', 'Mayan', 'ancient', 'language', 'totally', 'subtitled.The', 'main', 'theme', 'film', 'capture', 'Mayan', 'tribe', 'rivals', 'main', 'character', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'hide', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'child', 'cave', 'seeing', 'father', 'executed', 'taken', 'captive', 'rest', 'villagers', 'are', 'either', 'executed', 'taken', 'captive', 'neighbouring', 'village', 'children', 'are', 'left', 'women', 'are', 'auctioned', 'slaves', 'men', 'are', 'taken', 'sacrifice', 'local', 'pyramid', 'appease', 'Sun', 'God', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'watches', 'several', 'colleagues', 'have', 'heart', 'cut', 'are', 'beheaded', 'ritual', 'next', 'up', 'saved', 'terrible', 'death', 'solar', 'eclipse', 'sacrifices', 'stop', 'local', 'shamen', 'sun', 'gods', 'are', 'now', 'pleased', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'other', 'men', 'are', 'taken', 'away', 'be', 'disposed', 'rest', 'men', 'are', 'executed', 'cruel', 'game', ""'cat"", 'mouse', 'corn', 'field', 'wounded', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'son', 'chief', 'tribe', 'back', 'jungle', 'pursued', 'ten', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'try', 'kill', 'must', 'try', 'return', 'wife', 'child', 'evade', 'capture.The', 'film', 'beautiful', 'cinematographery', 'scenery', 'breathtaking', 'especially', 'ancient', 'Mayan', 'costumes', 'waterfall', 'jungle', 'animals', 'However', 'film', 'also', 'exceptionally', 'gory', 'violent', 'think', 'justified', 'case', 'was', 'non-Christian', 'society', 'where', 'sacrifice', 'pillage', 'were', 'norm.At', 'back', 'film', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'tale', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'chase', 'movie', 'fast', 'cars', 'However', 'hold', 'viewers', 'attention', 'terrific', 'scenes.The', 'buckets', 'blood', 'might', 'put', 'lot', 'people', 'not', 'thought', 'added', 'tension']",N/A

I know you can do it. That said, this film, although colorful and well-done as far as make-up and sets are concerned, is a huge disappointment. It is really the ""Bourne Ultimatum"" with bad acting. There is one chase after the other, lots of blood and guts, and then the happy ending. It's the worst kind of trivial Hollywood entertainment, pure Saturday afternoon cartoon dreck, but it stands out from the crowd because of the expectation created by Gibson's previous work that it might be historically interesting and perhaps even inspiring. Unfortunately, it fails at all levels, save for the extraordinary costume designs and sets which may or may not be historically accurate. Let the anthropologists work that out. For myself, it was pure nonsense from first to last and a complete waste of a real talent with the means to do virtually anything. When the Spanish arrive, we are to assume that Gibson wants to suggest that America del Sur had finally been liberated by its burden of heathen prejudice and had finally gotten the chance to discover Our Lord the Saviour.

If you do not want spoilers...do not read this review.I've watched this movie; as a matter of fact, I have watched it three times.  I find it riveting for some reason.  The story here at first glance is quite simple.  A peaceful group (A tribe really) living in the jungle is attacked by a group of Mayan warriors.  Their village is destroyed.  Most of the people are brutally slaughtered.  A group of men and women are taken prisoner and led off to (as the story unfolds) an unknown region.  When they arrive at the Mayan city some of the captives are sold into slavery while others, all male, are sent to be sacrificed to the Mayan Gods.  Grim and gruesome stuff here folks!One of these men who is to have his heart ripped out and head cut off escapes at the last minute.  The remainder of the story consists of this young man running from a group of warriors through the jungle, who are trying to kill him as he tries to return to the site of his destroyed village and save his pregnant wife and young son who have hidden in a deep well from which there is no escape without help - most certain death.As I watched this film I could not help but remember one of my favorite movies from 1966 - ""The Naked Prey,' with Cornel Wilde playing the lead.  This was a different story line, different country, different time and different circumstances, but still and all these two films shared much in common and both have their origins with the true story of John Colter's legendary escape from the Blackfoot Indians in the 1800s.  There is much drama and action in all three of these tales; both the true stories and the fictional.Now potential viewers should take note.  The movie being reviewed here is most certainly not for the squeamish.  The violence is brutal, heartless and above all, graphic and there is a lot of it.  Death in this movie is not painful and the film leaves very little to the imagination.  Being hacked apart with stone weapons is not a pretty sight.  I will say though (and this is strictly my own opinion) that the violence is not gratuitous.  No, the entire movie is based of violence and without it the story simply could not be told and the overall effect would be completely lost.  If you are offended by such, then you probably need to make another entertainment choice.  The graphic violence and action is almost nonstop throughout this film.I not via reading these reviews, both there and on other sites and through conversations with friends that there are some objections to this film, the primary one being that it is not ""historically accurate.""  I am neither an expert on the Mayan civilization nor an expert as to this particular era.  On the other hand, I have a lot of general information.  First, I do not feel that the maker of this film (Gibson...more about that later), was trying to make a documentary or academic work of any sort.  This is an action/adventure film...simple as that.  I do know (From what little I do know) that the look and feel of the entire film ""felt right.""  With the exception of the time line involved here, I should think that no one really truly knows for sure all the historical facts concerning this particular civilization.  After all, the Europeans more or less destroyed as much of the civilization as they possibly could, which included any written records.  Much of what we know of the Mayan Civilization is records kept by Europeans (for the most part Priests) and from what I can tell many of the accounts handed down to us are questionable at best.  No, if you want a documentary then you had best watch the History Channel, Discovery Channel or better yet, read a good book.  I would also like to know if anyone has every seen a film based on historical facts that Hollywood  did not fiddle with.  If such a film exists, I certainly have not seen it.The second biggest objection as to this film seems to be that Mel Gibson made it.  Mel Gibson is not a very popular guy right now due to some very poor and misguided life choices he has made recently.  Included in this criticism of Gibson, are critical comments that Gibson was somehow trying to make a religions statement in having the Spanish ships show up at the very last and of course carrying a cross, there by symbolizing that the ""Christians are coming, the Christians are coming"" and all will be well.  I for one did not get this impression at all.  Perhaps I am missing something?  I do know (an it is pretty much historical fact here) that the brutality displayed by the Mayan was only a wee bit less than the brutality displayed by the Europeans as they pretty well conquered two continents over the next couple hundred years.  If this was Gibson's intention (and I doubt if it was), then he missed a big hunk of his history lessons while growing up.I more or less ignored the fact that Gibson made the movie as I am not all that pleased with him myself at this time. (Hey, I think Shawn Penn is an absolute twerp but have to admit the little guy can act and makes good movies.)I was fascinated with the photography in this film...it is some of the best I have seen for this particular genre.  The action was swift and never ending.  The story was believable (Yes, there were instances where the viewer's credulity may be stretched just a bit - but most action adventure movies do this when you really thing about it).  I liked the fact that the entire movie's dialog was done is subtitles - this lent realism.I am entertained while watching this movie and while my standards for entertainment may not be that of others, still and all, this movie worked for me and to be honest, the only reason I set through movies is to be entertained.  I will be the first to admit though; this movie will not be for everyone...most certainly not!Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",5,THIS ONE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE BUT I WAS ENTERTAINED AND LIKED

1005614,A92GS5YVX97H3,B000GNOKQG,"dbwith ""dbwith""","[4, 20]","I have been a Mel Gibson fan for many years.  I truly loved his movie ""Braveheart"" based on the true events of William Wallace in Scotland.  I love movies that are based on Fact or true events.  However, his last few movies haven't done it for me.  For instance ""The Passion of Christ"" a truly wonderful movie, however you missed so much of the movie and the partayal of actual events due to the fact that you had to read each word that was spoken.  The same goes for ""Apocalypto"" the Movie was a great movie based on an ancient civilization the Mayans.  I watched the movie very intently and I watched the bonus features also.  They spoke of how hard it was to find a location to film, mainly due to the fact that they wanted the viewer to get the feeling of how life was in a dense rain forest and how hard life was, when they had to watch out for each other and other tribes that may want them as slaves.  However, I would have been able to enjoy more of the movie, the location the movie was filmed and the actual events if I didn't have to read each word that was spoken. I understand the desire to make the movie as original as possible, and even the clothing was as original and hand made just for this film, a lot of work and research went into this movie, not excluding the budget.  However, I believe I could have enjoyed the movie more, understood the movie more and how an ancient civilization lived if I didn't have to read each word that was spoken.  I believe that Mr. Gibson should have given the viewer the option as to whether they wanted to view the DVD with the translation, or just have it in english.  I think that we could have got more from the film if we didn't have to continualy read what was being said.  I'm sorry Mel I can't give this movie the rating it should have for that very reason, even though I understand what you and your writers were trying to do.  Mel you are a great Actor and Director, but maybe you need to rethink the way you want your movies to be viewed.

1005619,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B000GNOKQG,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[2, 2]","Mel Gibson's 2006 film Apocalypto contains all the essential elements of the typical epic drama: over 2 hours of nonstop action where an unassuming hero, the young family man Jaguar Paw, played excellently by Rudy Youngblood, finds himself in a vicarious situation where his home and hearth are threatened and he is forced to venture out from what he knows in order to protect and defend what he holds dear.As a Mayan warrior living at the time of the conquistador arrival in the New World, Jaguar Paw is familiar with the ways of the Yucatan jungle where he and his ancestors have lived comfortably for generations.  The audience first sees him with his fellow hunters and shares in the easy fellowship that exists in the village.  We admire the loving relationship that identifies him as a father and husband, but most of all it is that Rousseau-ian wild child, hanging-around-without any-clothes-in-the-forest innocence that we covet.  Jaguar Paw seems to have it all; that is until another Mayan contingency plunders through his village, kills the undesirables and transports JP with other potential slaves and human sacrifices to the Temple of the feathered-snake god, Kukulcan, in the central Mayan metroplex of Chichen Itza.Gibson films with amazing authenticity - his depiction of the internal and external suffering of JP and his village counterparts creates gut-wrenching moments of the sort he is famous for in Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ.  We not only feel the pain, we live through the exhilaration generated when Gibson utilizes the universal power of myth where the hero travels within a mythical woods fraught with peril leading to an emotionally and physically transcendental initiation that allows him to not only combat the forces of evil, but return to his loved ones fully transformed.Is Gibson merely reenacting the mythical hero's journey or is he simply employing a powerful story to underline a contemporary message?  Apparently he feels strongly enough about whatever the significance is to finance both JP's and JC's (The Passion of the Christ) metamorphosis with personal funds.  However, facilitating graphically painful violence, torture and almost horror movie techniques, he, at times, over illustrates his point.  Beneath all the gore, what is he depicting---man's penchant for inhumanity or his own seemingly insatiable desire to photograph it? Is he using the blood spectacle to mesmerize and entertain the crowd not unlike the emperors of Rome used the battles to the death in the coliseum?  Or does he, like some ancient shaman believe that something purifying and spiritual is born from the mythic ""the-king-must-die"" blood sacrifice?  Like the front piece to the film, historian Will Durant's quotation, ""A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within,"" and the actual depiction of the debauched sickness ensuing from the lower levels of the Mayan society to the garish strangeness of the upper classes, Gibson firstly drives home the idea that as a particular society evolves it becomes jaded by its own sophistication.  What is, at one time, new and exciting, degenerates into old and boring necessitating the exploration of newer and better thrills to achieve a sense of satisfaction.Gibson's heroes differ from the usual Campbell heroes of a thousand faces that need the quest to mature and redefine their values. Their morality and goodness stands firm and in terms of development they remain the same from start to finish.  From the vantage point of the audience, pandemonium reigns --- the sights and sounds of the debauched society evokes that alien quality George Lukas used so well in Star Wars when Luke Skywalker infiltrates the cosmic bar and innocence personified encounters an assortment of cynical alien rou&eacute;s.  We sense peace only in the major characters.  Yes, they are terrorized by the ordeal they are about to undergo, but spiritually they remain steadfast.  Instead, they are the only characters that by their stability and quiet resolve fill the hole carved out by the heart of darkness.Each of Gibson's major characters undergoes his trial by fire by understanding fully that his objective has little to do with the actual ordeal and all to do with their sense of self and their responsibility to their family and home. The cultures he depicts have degraded into abysses of the spiritual where the accumulation of wealth naturally erodes be they ancient Rome in the time of Christ (Passion of the Christ), the British subjection of Scotland (Braveheart) and now in Apocalypto the Mayan Empire around the time when the old world collided with the new.  Those who can still be saved need some kind of mythic sacrificial figure that personifies the values of hearth and home.So, okay, Mel, I get it . . . we all are accidental participants in a corrupt society---desensitized by our own complexity, in dire need of a sacrificial lamb to reconnect us with the all important simple things that life unfolds and ultimately death and the after-life reveals.Bottom line? Mel Gibson's Apocalypto may provide a colorful and raucous panoramic view of a long gone civilization, but it also exemplifies the epic tale of Jungian archetypes where trial by fire transforms and drives the representative hero to extraordinary action.  Bloody in parts, it typifies that which Mel has become famous:  providing a sacrificial lamb that elevates hope and common good for the masses.

It has a great story, a terrific adventure and one of the most complete and hair-raising era reconstructions I have ever seen on TV. Mr Gibson is a great master of suspence and also a virtuoso of story-telling. Some scenes from this film (like that of the captives led across a river, leaving their kids behind) reminded me of the ""Passion"" and were really heart wrenching. There is of course some very violent scenes in the film but that was really the essence of the Maya era and their culture. In all cases possible, Mr Gibson avoided the pornography of violence and showed only what was needed to transpire the emotions and the agony of the ordinary people fighting against an inhuman meat grinder. The blood soaked nightmare of the poor captives is depicted in a terrific way, as is also the agonizing struggle for survival and family reunion.

While ""Apocalypto"" doesn't quite reach the level of overall magnificence of Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"", it frequently achieves greatness that equals many of that film's finer qualities.  The visual effects are outstanding, as is the glorious cinematography, and having a cast of unknowns portray a long-lost people from an epic, mysterious culture is a stroke of genius.  The cast is excellent.  If any ""name"" actor had been in this film it would have taken away from the effectiveness of the tribe as a whole, as a family.  The entire film is in subtitles, as the characters relate to one another in an ancient tongue, which is yet another effective dynamic for transporting the viewer to another time.  After seeing this film and ""Letters from Iwo Jima"", which is predominately subtitled, I jokingly related to friends that the best foreign films these days are coming out of Hollywood.  That was true until I experienced ""Pan's Labyrinth"", which is amazing!  As far as ""Apocalypto"" goes, most of the flaws are incredibly minor, the only parts that had me shaking my head were a few predictable plot elements that are eventually forgivable given the overall grandeur of the film as a whole.  As for the complaints about the excessive gore in ""Apocalypto"", it is used as part of the story not as a fetish of Mel Gibson, as so many critics claimed.  As far as that goes I found it to be completely hilarious when ""Apocalypto"" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Makeup, thus backhanding every critic across the face who downgraded the film for its excessive gore.  For a large portion of the movie, at least an hour in total, there is a fantastic chase that will leave everyone breathless.

1005625,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,B000GNOKQG,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[1, 1]","Forget what you think about Mel Gibson as a person, because either way this guy can make a movie.  The controversial ""Apocalypto"" is a film like no other, telling a compeling story of survival amidst extinction, using suspense and thrills that sends chills down the spine while being on the edge of your seat.  This was not the film I was expecting to see, but came away from it with a sense of power and strength, and the emotions of the will to survive.The first 20 minutes basically sets the Mayan village setting for us, with moments of humor (good humor at that), bonding, and family.  The dialouge is actually subtitled in English, which really is fitting for this movie.  Some of the cinematography gives you the feel of being in a Mayan jungle, and their language adds to the realism.  Once things get rolling - thus begins the roller coaster that never stops, as the Aztec (supposedly Aztec, but not necessarily) warriors make their move and all hell breaks loose, almost literally.  Powerful scenes of violence and cruelty continue constently, again adding to the realism and sickness of such an event - specifically the Aztec way of life.  The main charcatcer ""Jaguar Paw"" played by an impressive Rudy Youngblood, is captured (along with most of the rest of the villagers) by the Aztecs and leaves behind his pregnant wife and young son, though keeping them secretly in a safe location.  For the reminader of the movie, you know he has to get back to them and rescue them, promising them he would return.  But how can he possibly escape the fate that seems to be set in store for him and the villagers?The story actually is not as complex as I imagined it would have been.  This movie is basically a thriller/suspense, and doing whatever it takes to stay alive.  The only depth I really found was when a young girl speaks of a sort of prophecy.  No one wants to believe her, but the events begin coming true.  There is a good deal of insight into what life might have been like, and the sets and imagery used for the Aztec culture is shocking to an extent.  There seemed to be lots of detail, so that every aspect of this culture could be recognized.  Though its a shame to see what it represents, the great Aztec city is truly a spectacular sight, and Mel did just a fantastic job mkaing it come alive on film.Among the controvery associated with this film, its probably the amount of gore and violence that have people talking about the most.  From the beginning of this film to the end, you will find plenty of very disturbing scenes.  Its not really ment for entertainment purposes like a horror movie, but to give a more sense of realism.  Some scenes that really get gruesome is the eating of animal balls, hearts being torn out of bodies, beheadings, and squirting blood from a head.This film could also be considered action, though I wouldn't call it fun action at all.  Nevertheless, there are lots of fights and a ton of chases through the jungle.  The camera work is very impressive with these chases, with little to no shaking occuring.The charcaters are all convincing in this film.  The actors and actresses were chosen wisely.  Rudy Youngblood does a find job as the lead, but its the Aztec leaders that sell it the most.  Two very convincing and downright dirty villains are created, both of whom send a good dose of fear to the viewer.If you can deal with some disturbing scenes and lots of gore, this is a movie that everyone should see.  A great look into what might have very well been for these cultures.  It is very powerful and moving, and this movie is one you will never forget after watching.Acting - 4.5Action - 4.5Charcaters - 5Story - 4Overall - 4.5",5,[4.5] A thrill ride like no other,1197072000,"12 8, 2007",2007,3689,"['Forget', 'what', 'think', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'person', 'way', 'guy', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'controversial', 'Apocalypto', 'film', 'other', 'telling', 'compeling', 'story', 'survival', 'amidst', 'extinction', 'using', 'suspense', 'thrills', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'being', 'edge', 'seat', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'was', 'expecting', 'see', 'came', 'away', 'sense', 'power', 'strength', 'emotions', 'will', 'survive.The', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'basically', 'Mayan', 'village', 'setting', 'moments', 'humor', 'good', 'humor', 'bonding', 'family', 'dialouge', 'actually', 'subtitled', 'English', 'really', 'fitting', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'feel', 'being', 'Mayan', 'jungle', 'language', 'realism', 'Once', 'things', 'get', 'rolling', 'thus', 'roller', 'coaster', 'never', 'Aztec', 'supposedly', 'Aztec', 'not', 'necessarily', 'warriors', 'make', 'move', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'almost', 'literally', 'Powerful', 'scenes', 'violence', 'cruelty', 'continue', 'constently', 'again', 'adding', 'realism', 'sickness', 'such', 'event', 'specifically', 'Aztec', 'way', 'life', 'main', 'charcatcer', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'played', 'impressive', 'Rudy', 'Youngblood', 'captured', 'most', 'rest', 'villagers', 'Aztecs', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'young', 'son', 'keeping', 'secretly', 'safe', 'location', 'reminader', 'movie', 'know', 'get', 'back', 'rescue', 'promising', 'would', 'return', 'how', 'can', 'possibly', 'escape', 'fate', 'be', 'set', 'store', 'villagers', 'story', 'actually', 'not', 'as', 'complex', 'imagined', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'basically', 'thriller/suspense', 'doing', 'stay', 'alive', 'only', 'depth', 'really', 'found', 'was', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'speaks', 'sort', 'prophecy', 'one', 'believe', 'events', 'begin', 'coming', 'true', 'good', 'deal', 'insight', 'what', 'life', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'sets', 'imagery', 'used', 'Aztec', 'culture', 'shocking', 'extent', 'seemed', 'be', 'lots', 'detail', 'aspect', 'culture', 'could', 'be', 'recognized', 'shame', 'see', 'what', 'great', 'Aztec', 'city', 'truly', 'spectacular', 'sight', 'Mel', 'did', 'just', 'fantastic', 'job', 'mkaing', 'come', 'alive', 'controvery', 'associated', 'film', 'probably', 'amount', 'gore', 'violence', 'have', 'people', 'talking', 'most', 'beginning', 'film', 'end', 'will', 'find', 'plenty', 'very', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'not', 'really', 'ment', 'entertainment', 'purposes', 'horror', 'movie', 'give', 'more', 'sense', 'realism', 'scenes', 'really', 'get', 'gruesome', 'eating', 'animal', 'balls', 'hearts', 'being', 'torn', 'bodies', 'beheadings', 'squirting', 'blood', 'head.This', 'film', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'considered', 'action', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'fun', 'action', 'Nevertheless', 'are', 'lots', 'fights', 'ton', 'chases', 'jungle', 'camera', 'work', 'very', 'impressive', 'chases', 'little', 'shaking', 'occuring.The', 'charcaters', 'are', 'convincing', 'film', 'actors', 'actresses', 'were', 'chosen', 'wisely', 'Rudy', 'Youngblood', 'find', 'job', 'lead', 'Aztec', 'leaders', 'sell', 'most', 'Two', 'very', 'convincing', 'downright', 'dirty', 'villains', 'are', 'created', 'whom', 'send', 'good', 'dose', 'fear', 'viewer.If', 'can', 'deal', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'lots', 'gore', 'movie', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'great', 'look', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'very', 'well', 'been', 'cultures', 'very', 'powerful', 'moving', 'movie', 'one', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'watching.Acting', '4.5Action', '4.5Charcaters', '5Story', '4Overall', '4.5']",N/A

However, as soon as the village is invaded by the ruling Mayan tribe, the film just descends into an orgy of violence, gore and ugliness that just goes on and on and on.By focusing on the characters and using the violence more sparingly, Gibson could have created a better film. But instead, he just throws as much carnage at the screen as he can. A jaguar rips a man's face off. Decapitated heads bounce off a temple. A huge mass grave of headless corpses attract a barrage of flies. After a while, after being assaulted with the relentlessly grotesque imagery, you just become desensitized to it all.

While it is somewhat overlong, in its attempt to encompass its central themes in more detail than might have been necessary, it is an interesting effort, with many implications. Certainly, for those of us who lived when tens of millions were enslaved, tortured, raped and pillaged, there cannot be any sensate person who can say that  these things could only happen among 'primitive' people. There are four foci: the happy village, capture by the slavers, ceremonial murder in the City, and the chase. Each encapsulates a state of mind and of relationships among and between peoples. I have no idea from what sources Mr. Gibson drew for his delineation but,  at a mildly abstract level, its a fair appraisal of what has been customary at one time or another in known societies.

The Bluray disc contains how the movie was made, one deleted scene and the movie.  I am surprised that there were no more deleted scenes.THE STORYThis is a story of a young hunter and warrior Jaguar Paw in a peaceful tribe.  The initial scene seems more of a locker scene amongst young athletes where they hunt a small tapir and distribute out the parts of the animal.  One of the brothers is teased about his manhood and the others prod him to eat the testicles of the animal.  The scene shifts towards a foreshadowing of terror as a tribe gives an offering to pass through.Set in the indigenous culture, we get a glimpse of the rituals, weapons, and dances of the Mayan people.  The pace of the movie speeds up, as the small village is attacked, and the hero, Jaguar Paw, is taken to a Mayan city where the women captives are sold as slaves and the men are sacrificed on an altar.The second part of the movie takes a breathtaking view of the rainforest in central America, as our hero is chased by his would be assailants, as an act of retribution for the killing of the Mayan Chief's son.THE MAKING OF APOCALYPTOThe documentary was well done and gave a lot of insight into the research and efforts made into the costume, dances and special effects.  I also enjoyed how the movie producers went into the challenges of shooting in the rainforest.  The video was also in 1080p with excellent sound.QUALITYThe sound and video quality are excellent.  The movie soundtrack is well done.  The costumes are greatly detailed - and in the Blu-ray version, you can see some of the women with their teeth in-laid with Emerald stones.  The movie is entirely in subtitles and I recommend watching the movie first while reading the subtitles.  Then I recommend watching it for the sheer beauty and details that these artists have created.CAUTIONThe brutality of the movie is intense.  From the initial scene of the killing of the Tapir, to the rape and pillage of the small peaceful village, to the death march, sacrificial scenes, death by Jaguar mauling, and extreme fight scenes - the movie is not for the faint of heart.  Some periods of nudity are also portrayed.VERDICTI enjoyed this movie.  The fights and pursuit scenes are exciting.  The sacrificial scene was as authentic as I could recall from the history books.

1005641,A1GBVCADZBO8YG,B000GNOKQG,Emc2,"[8, 9]","Highly recommended. It's just unbelievable that Apocalypto didn't win a single Academy Award. This movie is so refreshing, original and realistic. For the first time we have a chance to see how the natives of the Americas lived before the Spaniards came. Realistic on every aspect, what a photography, the beautiful natural sceneries and all the details: the wall drawings, the clothes, the use of Jade, the Mayan City. And the set was built just for the movie, it's impressive that Gibson chose not to use computer generated FX!. The ""behind the scenes"" bonus included in the DVD explains in rich details the hard work required to recreate the Mayan World so faithfully. More authenticity to the movie is given by the use of Yucatec Maya language, still spoken by Mayan descendants in Southern Mexico and Guatemala.Though a little bit exaggerated in the amount of human sacrifices, it was good to have a more realistic idea of how the Mesoamerican natives lived, specially when some modern revisionist have been trying to make us believe that all natives were just some peaceful environmentalists, living in harmony with nature, the famous myth of the noble savage. This movie produces the same reality shock as ""Saving Private Ryan"" gave us regarding the savage killings on both sides at WWII. So, for me the dose of violence was justified to crack this myth.Obviously a fiction story was required against this realistic historical background (such as in ""The Titanic""), but to set the record straight, at least a couple of historical inaccuracies need to be clarified, as well as an astronomical glitch, just to remember that this film is not a history class despite its realism.(1) The Mayan civilization was over before the Spaniards came to America, so the end of the film was just a historical inaccuracy necessary to give closure to the film. The classic Mayan period shown in the movie ended almost 600 years before the Spaniards came to America. The reasons for the decline of this civilization are not well known, but the movie gave us some clues (such as deforestation, hunger and illnesses). By the way, this was a nice way to raise environmental awareness without words.(2) The massive human sacrifices depicted in the movie actually resemble a practice more common of the Aztecs (Central M&eacute;xico), rather than Mayan (they did, but not in the ""industrial"" scale presented in the movie). The sun god Kukulkan did not demand human sacrifice, as presented in the movie.(3) The astronomical glitch has to do with the total eclipse of the sun. Not only an eclipse actually takes much longer to occur (a license acceptable for a time-constrained movie), but also a total eclipse only happens during a new moon (when the moon is invisible to us because the sun is behind, illuminating the dark side of the moon). Therefore, Jaguar Paw's wife could have never been under full moon later on the same day.And finally for those who really enjoy the movie and became interested in our ancient roots, such ruins of a Mayan city do exist. Visit Tikal, the largest existing ruins of a city from the Maya civilization. Plan a nice vacation to Guatemala and flight to Flores, in the Department of El Pet&eacute;n. The Tikal pyramids are located in the middle of a tropical rainforest. Quite a spectacle. If you like Tikal, then Teotihuacan (M&eacute;xico) and Machu Pichu (Per&uacute;) will be your next stops.",5,Outstanding recreation to the Mayan World,1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,3413,"['Highly', 'recommended', 'just', 'unbelievable', 'Apocalypto', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'single', 'Academy', 'Award', 'movie', 'so', 'refreshing', 'original', 'realistic', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'how', 'natives', 'Americas', 'lived', 'Spaniards', 'came', 'Realistic', 'aspect', 'what', 'photography', 'beautiful', 'natural', 'sceneries', 'details', 'wall', 'drawings', 'clothes', 'use', 'Jade', 'Mayan', 'City', 'set', 'was', 'built', 'just', 'movie', 'impressive', 'Gibson', 'chose', 'not', 'use', 'computer', 'generated', 'FX', 'scenes', 'bonus', 'included', 'DVD', 'rich', 'details', 'hard', 'work', 'required', 'recreate', 'Mayan', 'World', 'so', 'faithfully', 'More', 'authenticity', 'movie', 'given', 'use', 'Yucatec', 'Maya', 'language', 'still', 'spoken', 'Mayan', 'descendants', 'Southern', 'Mexico', 'Guatemala.Though', 'little', 'bit', 'exaggerated', 'amount', 'human', 'sacrifices', 'was', 'good', 'have', 'more', 'realistic', 'idea', 'how', 'Mesoamerican', 'natives', 'lived', 'specially', 'when', 'modern', 'revisionist', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'make', 'believe', 'natives', 'were', 'just', 'peaceful', 'environmentalists', 'living', 'harmony', 'nature', 'famous', 'myth', 'noble', 'savage', 'movie', 'same', 'reality', 'shock', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'gave', 'regarding', 'savage', 'killings', 'sides', 'WWII', 'So', 'dose', 'violence', 'was', 'justified', 'crack', 'myth.Obviously', 'fiction', 'story', 'was', 'required', 'realistic', 'historical', 'background', 'such', 'Titanic', 'set', 'record', 'straight', 'least', 'couple', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'need', 'be', 'clarified', 'as', 'well', 'astronomical', 'glitch', 'just', 'remember', 'film', 'not', 'history', 'class', 'realism', '1', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'was', 'Spaniards', 'came', 'America', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'historical', 'inaccuracy', 'necessary', 'give', 'closure', 'film', 'classic', 'Mayan', 'period', 'shown', 'movie', 'ended', 'almost', '600', 'years', 'Spaniards', 'came', 'America', 'reasons', 'decline', 'civilization', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'known', 'movie', 'gave', 'clues', 'such', 'deforestation', 'hunger', 'illnesses', 'way', 'was', 'nice', 'way', 'raise', 'environmental', 'awareness', 'words', '2', 'massive', 'human', 'sacrifices', 'depicted', 'movie', 'actually', 'resemble', 'practice', 'more', 'common', 'Aztecs', 'Central', 'M', 'eacute', 'xico', 'rather', 'Mayan', 'did', 'not', 'industrial', 'scale', 'presented', 'movie', 'sun', 'god', 'Kukulkan', 'did', 'not', 'demand', 'human', 'sacrifice', 'presented', 'movie', '3', 'astronomical', 'glitch', 'do', 'total', 'eclipse', 'sun', 'Not', 'only', 'eclipse', 'actually', 'much', 'longer', 'occur', 'license', 'acceptable', 'time-constrained', 'movie', 'also', 'total', 'eclipse', 'only', 'new', 'moon', 'when', 'moon', 'invisible', 'sun', 'illuminating', 'dark', 'side', 'moon', 'Therefore', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'wife', 'could', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'full', 'moon', 'later', 'same', 'day.And', 'finally', 'who', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'became', 'interested', 'ancient', 'roots', 'such', 'ruins', 'Mayan', 'city', 'do', 'exist', 'Visit', 'Tikal', 'largest', 'existing', 'ruins', 'city', 'Maya', 'civilization', 'Plan', 'nice', 'vacation', 'Guatemala', 'flight', 'Flores', 'Department', 'El', 'Pet', 'eacute', 'Tikal', 'pyramids', 'are', 'located', 'middle', 'tropical', 'rainforest', 'spectacle', 'like', 'Tikal', 'then', 'Teotihuacan', 'M', 'eacute', 'Machu', 'Pichu', 'Per', 'uacute', 'will', 'be', 'next', 'stops']",N/A

First, this movie takes place in post-classic maya, cities like chichenitza, uxmal and mayapan are the prototype of this movie's city, which DID have alot of valley of mexico civs influence. Mayan states in the classic and post classic did sacrifce war capitves first by removal of heart and then by decapitation, (see Schele & Mathews, Gann & Thompson) all the events of the sacrificing were accurate even down to the warrior chief's human jaw bones on his arm from his previous captive/sacrifices. More and more archaeological evidence is showing that the mayans were as sacrificial cult oriented as the Aztecs. All Gibson does is take what was perhaps a little bit rare and portray it in the movie.Second, the mayans were great astronomers, which is exactly why Gibson makes it obvious that the ruling elites in the film knew what was going on, they were simply afraid of their desperate subjects situation and needed to maintain belief in their own legitimacy.Third, many reviewers have claimed that gibson shows that the mayans needed saving from their barbarity by the spaniards. His real image was to show that the mayans were brutal, but withing the context of their societal norms. you didnt see the sacrifical priests or the warrior captain enjoying their killings, they were doing it as what they believed necessary to maintain their order. Contrast that with the spaniards vividly portrayed in de las Casas and Broken Spears who not only were equally barbarous as the Mayans, but also gleefully enjoyed their cruelty in the pursuit of gold and riches more often than not!All in all i think this movie is the best one in years, gibson's imagery and messages are subtle but unmistakable, and as one reviewer stated, the movie does need some afterthought particularly with focus on facial expressions of the characters.In addition, not all mayan states were completely ""lost"" when the spaniards arrived, many kingdoms, although not in their former glory, had begun to regrow, such as in tulum, coba, peten itza and q'iche, so this movie is not a far strech, perhaps he delayed some characteristics of urban maya ~100 yrs to ~1511 when the first documented spaniard arrived. it is not a stretch to imagine that small pox would have reached the maya prior to the actual arrival of the spanish due to their numerous regional exploits, (4th columbus, grijalva exped.) and then spread through mesoamerican trade. I even interpreted the refugees saying ""our lands were ravaged"" in the beginning as having been because of spaniards, such as they did in the grijalva expedition and the ones that shiprecked geronimo aguilar.acting is impeccableSimply put, well done Gibson, well done!",5,"Great Movie, very accurate",1165708800,"12 10, 2006",2006,2989,"['movie', 'was', 'fantastic', 'visual', 'displays', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'mayan', 'warriors', 'chasing', 'jaguar', 'paw', 'torches', 'night', 'waterfall', 'taunt', 'displays', 'jungle.i', 'see', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'there', 'claiming', 'movie', 'somehow', 'innacurate', 'claims', 'are', 'based', 'mayan', 'sterotypes', 'First', 'movie', 'place', 'post-classic', 'maya', 'cities', 'chichenitza', 'uxmal', 'mayapan', 'are', 'prototype', 'movie', 'city', 'DID', 'have', 'alot', 'valley', 'mexico', 'civs', 'influence', 'Mayan', 'states', 'classic', 'post', 'classic', 'did', 'sacrifce', 'war', 'capitves', 'first', 'removal', 'heart', 'then', 'decapitation', 'see', 'Schele', 'Mathews', 'Gann', 'Thompson', 'events', 'sacrificing', 'were', 'accurate', 'even', 'down', 'warrior', 'chief', 'human', 'jaw', 'bones', 'arm', 'previous', 'captive/sacrifices', 'More', 'more', 'archaeological', 'evidence', 'showing', 'mayans', 'were', 'sacrificial', 'cult', 'oriented', 'Aztecs', 'Gibson', 'take', 'what', 'was', 'perhaps', 'little', 'bit', 'rare', 'portray', 'movie.Second', 'mayans', 'were', 'great', 'astronomers', 'exactly', 'why', 'Gibson', 'obvious', 'ruling', 'film', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'were', 'simply', 'afraid', 'desperate', 'subjects', 'situation', 'needed', 'maintain', 'belief', 'own', 'legitimacy.Third', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'claimed', 'gibson', 'mayans', 'needed', 'saving', 'barbarity', 'spaniards', 'real', 'image', 'was', 'show', 'mayans', 'were', 'brutal', 'withing', 'context', 'societal', 'norms', 'didnt', 'see', 'sacrifical', 'priests', 'warrior', 'captain', 'enjoying', 'killings', 'were', 'doing', 'what', 'believed', 'necessary', 'maintain', 'order', 'Contrast', 'spaniards', 'vividly', 'portrayed', 'de', 'las', 'Casas', 'Broken', 'Spears', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'were', 'equally', 'barbarous', 'Mayans', 'also', 'gleefully', 'enjoyed', 'cruelty', 'pursuit', 'gold', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'i', 'think', 'movie', 'best', 'one', 'years', 'gibson', 'imagery', 'messages', 'are', 'subtle', 'unmistakable', 'one', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'movie', 'need', 'afterthought', 'particularly', 'focus', 'facial', 'expressions', 'characters.In', 'addition', 'not', 'mayan', 'states', 'were', 'completely', 'lost', 'when', 'spaniards', 'arrived', 'many', 'kingdoms', 'not', 'former', 'glory', 'had', 'begun', 'regrow', 'such', 'tulum', 'coba', 'peten', 'itza', ""q'iche"", 'movie', 'not', 'far', 'strech', 'perhaps', 'delayed', 'characteristics', 'urban', 'maya', '~100', 'yrs', '~1511', 'when', 'first', 'documented', 'spaniard', 'arrived', 'not', 'stretch', 'imagine', 'small', 'pox', 'would', 'have', 'reached', 'maya', 'prior', 'actual', 'arrival', 'spanish', 'due', 'numerous', 'regional', 'exploits', '4th', 'columbus', 'grijalva', 'exped', 'then', 'spread', 'mesoamerican', 'trade', 'even', 'interpreted', 'refugees', 'saying', 'lands', 'were', 'ravaged', 'beginning', 'having', 'been', 'spaniards', 'such', 'did', 'grijalva', 'expedition', 'ones', 'shiprecked', 'geronimo', 'aguilar.acting', 'impeccableSimply', 'put', 'well', 'done', 'Gibson', 'well', 'done']",N/A

While beautifully filmed, and including some excellent actors, there just really is nothing to this story, regardless of how much blood and gore is thrown across the screen.  Man is captured, his village wiped out and taken to a Mayan capital for sacrifice.

This is, at all technical and crafts levels, an astounding, state-of-the-art movie.Too bad Gibson's ballistic movie couldn't have had one more brief run in theaters, as a last call for fools like me who missed it last year. The film should seen on a big screen. Nonetheless, Buena Vista's single-disc presentation hits all the marks technically. The extras feel pretty skimpy here considering the wild tales about the production down in the jungles of Mexico and the historical potency of its subject matter. No doubt the DVD double-dip is straight ahead via some kind of multidisc collectors set.Gibson's commentary, done with and co-writer Farhad Safinia, has its moments but it's obvious little or no prep time went into that recording. Mostly they gossip about the native actors (some of whom had never seen a movie) and chat about what happened when they filmed this or that scene.The adventure, about Mayan villagers taken into slavery by city-dwellers, has taken heat for one of its historically inaccurate elements. More troubling for casual viewers could be the ridiculous deus ex machina devices that keep things moving along.

1005650,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B000GNOKQG,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[4, 4]","An enjoyable aspect of Mel Gibson's Apocolypto is that it is not your typical action film. It boasts no real big star names, and doesn't fall in love with itself like some films do. It simply tells a story. It could have been just another brainless action flick, but instead strives to illustrate the essence of one man's attempts at survival while using a Mayan civilization as the setting.  One tribe's fate is in jeopardy when the unthinkable happens: they become enslaved and the targets of a ritual sacrifice.To get this point over with, the movie is quite grisly, barbaric, graphic or whatever other word which successfully describes a lot of blood and death. There are scenes of some of Jaguar Paw's fellow tribesmen being beheaded, as well as many scenes of warriors being speared, impaled or killed in various other ways. There are even scenes of corpses rotting. I'm not one who relishes the idea of watching this type of thing, but I don't think that the barbarism in the film debunks the real story at hand. Another way to say this is: there is a point to the violence, and it in no way effects or tries to ""steal the show"" of the film's real essence: the struggle of Jaguar Paw (and others) to escape and get back to their land.What Gibson is able to achieve in many parts of this film is a fast-paced, yet mysterious and eerie atmosphere. There are moments, like at the film's beginning, when the quiet tranquility of the tribe's home is juxtaposed by the intrusion and ruthlessness of the other clan. There are also moments when Jaguar Paw is frantically running for his life in the brush, and then moments where he is quietly hiding with others hunting within feet of him, using his instincts as a warrior for escape. Also, the scenery of the forest really intensifies the feeling of the unknown, or danger lurking just beyond the next step. There are many chase scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat, and you feel yourself rooting for Jaguar Paw to make it back to his wife and kid as the rain starts pouring.If you can forgive Gibson for his shady reputation and just take in this film, I think you will find his film quite original, and scenery impressive for the film's mood.

1005655,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B000GNOKQG,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[16, 24]","As more than one commentator has noted, in terms of plot APOCALYPTO seems to draw from the 1966 THE NAKED PREY, the 1932 THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME, and the numerous films both have influenced over the years.  In this particular instance the story focuses on Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), whose presumably peaceful village is destroyed by Mayans intent upon obtaining human sacrifice to appease their bloodthirty gods.  After a harrowing march to the Mayan city, Jaguar Paw escapes death--and the city, with a furious party of Myan warriors in hot pursuit.Not surprisingly, there is considerable bleed-over from Mel Gibson's 2004 THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST into the 2006 APOCALYPTO.  The two have often been compared in terms of violence, but the connection goes quite a bit deeper this; it is imbedded in the subtext of the film itself.  A forced march while tied to long poles; a prayer uttered by a woman that sounds suspiciously like a Mayan-language Hail Mary; a prophesy that warns about a man ""reborn from mud and earth"" who will ""end your world;"" and enough arrow and javelin wounds to slay Saint Sebastian himself several times over.  The ending is a bit of a quandary, certainly more open to interpretation than that of THE PASSION--but striking the same tone and tying all the subtextual imagery directly to the Roman Catholic Church.  And we need hardly mention the title of the film itself, a reference to the vision of St. John the Divine.It is also worth noting that, like THE PASSION, APOCALYPTO has a none too subtle point: the Mayans, at least as Gibson presents them (the film is riddled with historical inaccuracy, but I'll leave that argument to the scholars), are a corrupt society en route to self-destruction: they have stripped the land of its resources and their civilization has become unsustainable.  Given Gibson's own well-known religious sentiments, there is a certain irony in that the Mayans are driven into this by blindly-followed religious motives.  In any case, we are clearly intended to read the overall film as commentary of sorts on contemporary society's rape of the planet.Although I would give the dubious prize of ""most violent"" to THE PASSION, there is plenty to go around in APOCALYPTO--and, as in THE PASSION, it is not always of a viable nature.  I find it hard to believe that Jaguar Paw's tribe hunted with the horrifically lethal trap shown here; the Mayans were not as blood-thirsty as portrayed here (Gibson seems to have confused them with the Aztecs), and lot many of the rituals, weapons, and the game of ""run for your life"" itself, are highly speculative at best.  Even so, I cannot actually say that the violence or its graphic nature are implausible within the context of the film.What IS completely implausible is the amount of physical damage Jaguar Paw sustains without being mortally wounded.  He is dragged along in bondage, half hung by accident, escapes sacrifice by a fraction of a second, is shot through with an arrow, and all the rest--but like the old Timex Watch slogan, he takes a licking and keeps on ticking, seeming to run without pause for forty-eight hours, vaulting down a waterfall, and even getting clipped a time or two more, most often with scarcely a pause to wince.  But Gibson is fair about it: he endows Jaguar Paw's pursuers with the same absurdly improbable endurance and strength.Although it has its flaws--and what film doesn't?--the truly great thing about APOCALYPTO is the technical brilliance and artistic eye that Gibson and his team bring to the project.  It's visually dazzling, and Gibson and cinematographer Dean Semler have knack for selecting one knock-out camera set up after another.  Everything from cast to costumes is truly amazing, and the film moves with tremendous speed.  One thing it isn't is dull.But it is extremely troubling.  In addition to THE PASSION, one might also compare it to the notorious 1979 CALIGULA, a film which so mingled sex and violence that both could be considered equally pornographic.  Although there's no visual sex at all--it is a subject Gibson tends to shy away from--APOCALYPTO has much the same effect.  The violence is essentially pornographic in nature, teasing us, leading us on to increasingly intense climaxes of blood and gore.  One has to wonder at the motives here, particularly when the producer-director-writer is so clearly trying to make a ""save the world"" statement; it seems to me that Gibson's visions are less a solution than part of the problem itself--and doesn't mind, as many scholars have noted, twisting historical fact in the process.

1005660,ARVD6Y9Z1E4D4,B000GNOKQG,"G. Kline ""art & technology""","[7, 16]","After several hundred reviews, the movie has 4 stars out here in Amazon-ville.  I can't understand why so many people don't see the failed potential of this movie.  Gratuitous primitive slaughter and terror for the bulk of a movie is appealing?  You don't need a solid story?  Where's the discriminating viewer here?  It reminds me of Rome, where the citizens were more interested in seeing people ripped apart by gladiators than the welfare of their state.I'm sorry, but Mel Gibson is capable of so much more.  He's a VERY talented actor and director.  Why oh why did he let this possible gem become a pile of decaying bodies?  When you have such a huge budget and a cadre of talented people, you need to be responsible to produce something worthwhile.I won't recap what the story is about--that's been done many times over so that won't be helpful.  Where this movie fails is in providing a full story cycle that is believable.  The story is very brief, but drags on, fixated on repetitive themes of terror.  And there are so many scenes that are unbelievable.What really shines in this movie is the revival of Mayan speech and dialect.  It is astoundingly convincing and I think Gibson could have leveraged this more, given the amount of work involved by the actors.  Also, the costumes are amazing--Mayes Rubeo did a fabulous job.  The mannerisms of the characters are a little too modern for what I find believable, especially the facial expressions of lead antagonist head-hunter.There are several things I believe Gibson should have done, that would have made this movie spectacular:*** NOTE: Spoilers follow ***1) More time on the peaceful village, giving us an opportunity to get a better sense of how these people lived and interacted between their groups.2) More time on the Mayan temple city.  The Mayans achieved some amazing feats of invention, despite their bloodthirsty rituals.  Instead we were given only a showing of an insane group of lunatics hell bent on slavery and sacrifice.3) The overall theme presented is ""advanced Mayan city seeks out their primitive neighbors living in the forest and annexes them to their way of life, featuring slavery and sacrifices"".  Sure, OK--show some sacrifices.  But also show what happens to the newly captured people when first enslaved.  How do they manage to survive?  What of the people already there--what do they learn from them?  Is there any hope of escape?4) Do away with senseless implausibility:* The forest chase was mostly linear.  I'm sorry, but Jaguar Paw demonstrated the intelligence to serpentine when running across the dirt field to avoid arrows from his captors.  Why would he not choose to deviate from his straight path of flight in an area where there would be minimal signs of his maneuvering?  Surely he knows the terrain very well... there must be alternate routes back to the pit where his wife remained.  Also, the villains pursued him without any preparation... yet when nightfall came, they suddenly have torches?* Jaguar Paw was hit by two arrows.  The nature of his wounds would NOT have let him revive in such a short time and be able to run for hours on end--this was quite ridiculous.  He was also starved and without water for days.  He would NOT have had the energy to run like that, even discounting his wounds.* Jaguar Paw's pregnant wife was subjected to physical blows that would have easily caused serious harm to the baby--I'm surprised she gave birth so effortlessly and to a very healthy baby.  Also, she'd be far too heavy being pregnant to even try raising herself out of that pit.  I'd expect the pit would've been stocked with some tools and at least a means of climbing up several feet to avoid drowning when the rains would come (obviously known, judging from her husband's reaction to the threat of rain).  She could've sustained herself and her son by killing and eating a few creatures that fall into the pit, so that her husband could be away longer without cutting into the plausibility of her survival.* A solar eclipse does not come and go in a matter of a few minutes.  This was an absurd violation of the laws of physics and looked quite comical.  Of course this was a vehicle to save Jaguar Paw from certain death.  But there could have been other more imaginative ways to do it.* A pile of rotting bodies would not look so nearly fresh.  Given the number, this is more than the day's sacrifices.  We see mostly intact bodies (save the heads) strewn all over the landscape, covered with grime but lacking torn or rotting flesh.  We hear the buzz of flies... but where are the birds and other animals that would normally scavenge on this?  Also, the stench would be unbearable as Jaguar Paw landed on top of the pile.  He showed no reaction to that horrid smell.* The poisonous frog--great idea, but he prepared only three thorns?  Certainly this would be a very effective weapon (discounting the poor aim from a rolled leaf tube) as was proved.  Why not grab a bunch of thorns (at least 9) and flee with the frog in hand, so that he'd have more time elsewhere to create his ammunition?5) Less time on the chase.  It really went on far too long, to measure up to the sustainability of Jaguar Paw's flight.6) The arrival of the Spaniards was a blatant mistake on the timeline of this civilization.  I would have expected a small fleet of boats from a sea faring tribe having arrived.  The effect would have been enough and definitely plausible, clearly showing how the peaceful forest people were falling behind other groups--the captors having a city of architected buildings and a sea faring tribe with capable vessels.We were left with the bulk of the movie focused on brutal terror and a long improbable chase against impossible odds.  Sure, there was a certain thrill to being uncertain of how it would all turn out.  But in the end, it was hollow entertainment.  The movie definitely needs more substance.  What a shame, given the enormous budget.  :-/So there you have it... if you're got a couple of hours to kill and you want to watch some convincing primitive terror, here's the movie for you.  If you're curious about Mayan history and what that civilization was like, this is but a very narrow glimpse that is misleading.  I'd move on and watch something else.",2,"Apocalypto?

Truly a cinematographic feast.Compare to Cecil B. DeMille's (sp?) work. Not much of this grand pageantry anymore.The extra scenes about the making of the film were excellent. I didn't see most of the details they mentioned, until I looked back at the actors again. It was that realistic, so that even the ""wild"" fashions of the era seemed natural on the people.It was great to get a better idea of Mayan - and also Aztek - life. I think the Olmecs were similar, too. Each bloody dynasty in its age.But it can be hard to visualize the times and the people just from Discovery Channel specials, or flaking wall paintings. Mel did us all a service, in his inimitable ""12-expresso"" emotional style.Whatever you think of him personally - and we *don't* know him personally, apart from media bites that are *designed* for controversy,not the Gospel Truth --Mel is a GREAT writer/director/producer. Worthy of study by aspiring writers/film-makers.I can't say I loved this film, like so many reviewers have. I didn't, as far as the story line went, because I don't like Mel's graphic depictions of human pain and bloody injuries. I hate films about human cruelty, and oppression - but that was how it was.""Entertaining"", well, not really in a fun sense. It was a gripping, tension-rollercoaster of a movie. As a good film ought to, it pulled me into the experience of the characters.Life is often painful and ugly, not ""politically correct"", so these are things that ""hook"" a wide audience. We may feel revulsion, but on some level we relate. I see many viewers felt entertained in a good way - and I will consider that in crafting my own writing.I would almost call this a horror film. ""Historical horror"" fits.Go see it, leave the kids out of it, and learn about Mayan culture.Become more thankful for our relatively safe and easy life. Work for social justice - the Maya are not the only abusers out there - and as the village elder said ""don't let the fear get into you"".It is possible to draw parallels between Mayan behavior and corporate culture. And socially - are we so different?

Gibson somehow succeeded in making and distributing a film that does much more than just entertain.  From the opening scene, the moviegoer is transported to an alien world that most have next to no knowledge of.  The Maya civilization is brought to life, complete with believable characters, incredible costumes and magnificent architecture.It is obvious that Gibson and his production crew did their homework.Archaelogical evidence confirms that the Maya did indeed perform grisly sacrifice on a very large scale, as the film so graphically portrays.  It is also well known that the Maya were more advanced in astronomy than any European civilization of the day; their calendar needed no leap year.""Apocalyto"" is no dry historical drama.  It is well written, with fully fleshed characters.  The fact that this film holds the viewer's interest is all the more amazing when one considers the fact that there is not a single word of English in the entire film.  Like many good movies with subtitles, the story is so enthralling that after a time one forgets about the writing at the bottom of the screen.In the end, ""Apocalypto"" is really about devotion to family, and survival against the odds.

1005665,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000GNOKQG,Grady Harp,"[2, 7]","Viewing APOCALYPTO is a visual and visceral experience: some of the most beautiful cinematic depictions of skies, jungles, raging rivers and extraordinary recreations of Mayan temples and peoples fill the screen for a very long two and a half hours.  The images include excessive violence (beheadings, punjee stake traps, genocidal type destruction of a village of people, brutalized slaves, etc) and concentrate more on chases than on drama.  But the effect presented is richly colorful and imaginative.There is little story to tell.  A quiet and fearless tribe spends its time hunting, teasing a fellow tribesman about his infertility and making him the brunt of cruel jokes - just the ordinary camaraderie we are led to believe - until our main character Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) hears a shudder in the jungle that results in his tribe being overtaken by a more aggressive, human sacrificing tribe.  The village is burned, Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and child in a well, and he and the remaining villagers are taken into slavery and marched to the Mayan capital where they are sacrificed by Mayan priests to appease the gods to save their crumbling empire.  A sun eclipse saves Jaguar Paw, he escapes, and after an interminable chase through the jungle reunites with his wife and children just as the Spanish conquistadors sail into harbor.The cast responds well to the direction of Mel Gibson.  Outstanding among them are of course Rudy Youngblood, Dalia Hern&aacute;ndez, Jonathan Brewer, Morris Birdyellowhead, Mar&iacute;a Isabel D&iacute;az, Espiridion Acosta Cache, Raoul Trujillo and Rodolfo Palacias among others. But nearly as much credit goes to the costumer and hairpiece design (Mayes C. Rubeo) and to the set builders (Jay Aroesty) of the Mayan Temples.  Visually the movie is stunning though in a graphically gross sort of way.  The problem lies with the lack of significant information about the fall of the Mayan Empire, one of the more advanced civilizations known: Gibson would have us see only the brutal savagery of a highly sophisticated body of people.

1005666,A34FEX6IPQL95G,B000GNOKQG,"Greg C. Unleashed ""cinemaguys.com""","[2, 14]","Mel Gibson, (world famous actor) and now more recently actor turned director of such films as; Brave Heart (director and actor), The Passion of the Christ (director) gives us the story of Apocalypto (director and writer.)I believe that Mel Gibson was intoxicated when that cop pulled him over and during that time the prophecy of making this film came to past, to satisfied the ""God's"" of  Hollywood.Our movie opens up in the forests of Northern Central American regions.  A group of Mayans are chasing after a Tapir (a pig like animal) and after killing the animal they come across a group of refugees. Jaguar Paw our main character (Rudy Youngblood), decides to ask them where they are going but, his Grandfather Flint Sky (Morris BirdYellowhead) stops him from proceeding with any further questions. When returning back to their village they are enjoying themselves when suddenly they are attacked by a Maya War Party and majority of the women and men are taken back to the Maya City. While they are being taken as prisoners, our hero manages to save his pregnant wife and small child by putting them in a pit.  While traveling to the Mayan Metropolis, they encounter a little girl who spoke about a prophecy (who looks like a younger version of Satan, from Passion of the Christ.) She tells them of a great darkness that will befall the Mayan civilization resulting from a solar eclipse and of a man who will run with the jaguars--in fact, he was being chased by the jaguar. The Mayan war party ignores the little girl's prophecy. Will the prophecy come to past? Will Jaguar Paw escape from his captives and the jaguar? You have to see this movie to fine out!!Mel Gibson the actor (Funny, cool, and a nice guy) but Mel (the director) he is serious, likes history, but he also likes a lot of gore and brutality to help express his story telling.Mel Gibson's direction of Acopatypto is somewhat different then his previous two films; Brave Heart, and  The Passion of the Christ.  In the first he had to show that fighting in battle would present gore and brutality and in the Passion he had to show the realism of Jesus Christ's torturing and most importantly a sadistic nature by the Romans who were torturing him.Now, Mr. Gibson is presenting a movie that we think is about the Mayan civilization, and first off we think that the movie should be about the understanding of the culture, the avant-garde cities, the towering pyramids, their mathematics, and even their astronomy. There are a lot of inaccuracies with this movie as some critics have stated; the architecture, the murals used in the movie (Mel put in extra footage in the paintings), and most importantly their costumes and traditions ( when the Mayans were throwing the bodies off the Pyramids and the female dancers (in which the females didn't participate at in the Mayan rituals) were catching the bodies in big fishing nets.Instead he decides to focus on a similar theme of brutality and gore from his previous two films. You might ask the question, why not?He has a political theme. He compares Mayan human sacrifice with ""sending guys off to Iraq for no reason."" Folks, after I viewed this film I would have to agree and disagree with Mr. Gibson point of view. First off, let me explain what he is trying to say. He understands (through his research, right!) that the Mayans were pious about offering themselves to their Gods and our Americans soldiers have that same honor and respect for God and our country. That all sounds great but he does not present the Mayans who are being offered to be of a pious nature but that of a slave mentality with a Hostel (the horror film) intent. What people should perceive from his point of view is that senseless killing is going on not only in Iraq but the rest of the world, like Africa. But for the average movie goers they will never understand that there is even a political subtext being considered for this film.Now folks, lets talk about the film itself and boy, there are some problems with this film. His direction has no originality, why? Because, he uses themes from his previous films that he has directed and acted in. One example that comes to mind is the fighting sequences used toward the end of our film. When one of the War party that being the Maya chief (Mauricio Amuy Tenorio) is confronting Jaguar Paw. This is the same exact scene from the movie The Patriot, where Col. William Tavington (Jason Isaacs) is facing off against Benjamin Martin (Mel) and the only difference is instead of a battle field, it is now the jungle. Or, when Jaguar Paw is going to be sacrificed and he has the image of his wife flash into his mind, which is the same thing in Brave Heart. When William Wallace at his execution he sees his dead bride's ghost Murron , (Catherine McCormack) walking through the crowds of people. But what really got my attention is that he had to take themes from Predator and some reminders of Home Alone.  There are several instances for example when Jaguar Paw falls from the water fall or, when Jaguar Paw falls into the mud while running from his pursuers.Or, when Jaguar Paw throws a disguised bee hive at his pursuers and when he takes poison from a frog to use it as a weapon. This has a very similar theme to what Kevin (Culkin) did in Home Alone 1 and 2.Please, if you are going to see this movie with the intent of understanding the Mayan Culture and their advancements. Please stay home because this movie shows brutality and Sadistic brutality with gore. This movie is an insult to the Mayan people because there are still six million descendants still living in Mexico and Central America, who he still has to answer too.",2,This movie shows brutality

1005668,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B000GNOKQG,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[1, 1]","I initially didn't want to see this, but a friend of mine whose opinion I trust told me it's a great film.  He said ""yeah, Gibson's crazy, but he's a great filmmaker"".  So I rented it, and I'm glad I did.This is a great film, a really stunning piece of work that's remarkable in many ways.  There are no big name stars, and most of the actor are non-professionals.  It's primarily told through imagery, and the little dialogue there is is in Mayan.  It's very bloody and violent, though not the gore fest that many critics made it out to be.  It's a very good film, filled with truly awe inspiring scenes, especially in the middle of the film when the action reaches the Mayan city.  The Mayan city sequences alone make the film worth watching, as they are astounding and the best of Gibson's career as a director.  The Mayan city was all a set, one of the biggest ever built, and kudos to the production designer for this magnificence.  After the action leaves the city, the film is still mesmerizing with a great chase sequence ending the film.  The action is well choreographed, the film looks sumptuous, especially for HD video,and the performances that Gibson obtains from his cast of mostly non-professional actors is nothing short of amazing.  They're so natural, realistic, and authentic.  There's no self consciousness at all on their part, and this can be attributed to the excellence of the filmmaking.  The costume design, makeup, and set design are all excellent, and Gibson deserves full credit for making one of the most unique films in cinema history.The first third of the film is a bit tired, with silly dialogue and situations that are reminscent of a teenage comedy.

It gets you tired just watching it.The movie is about a young Indio warrior Jaguar'sPaw who is captured by Mayan slavers, lead by El Jefe and- has his pregnant wife abandoned in a pit,- while Jaguar's Paw is taken to the great Mayan city to be sacrificed- they pass a village that has apparently been ravaged by smallpox,- and they pass an old fellow with some type of laughing sickness.Note:  Many scholars believe the Mayan Empire was devastated by some type of Biological hazard they just don't know which one.Back to the human sacrifices:-first they cut out the heart-then they chop off the heads and throw them down the steps,Then they throw the headless body down the steps.Just as the Mayans are getting ready to cut Jaguar's Paw `s heart out there is a solar eclipse.  This they interpret as the Sun God being satiated.  And they take the prisoners to the gauntlet to run for their life.  Fortunately Jaguar'sPaw gets to go in the second pair and quickly see that he needs to weave as he runs, thereby making himself a harder target.Well wouldn't you know that he almost makes it.  JaguarPaw manages to kill El Jefe's son, the finisher, and makes it to thejungle. Jaguar's Paw successfully runs the gauntlet, escapes from a blackjaguar(I didn't know there was such an animal, jumps over a giantcataract, throws a hornets nest at his enemies, his wife has a baby inthe flooded pit, and then just when he can't run any more and collapses...You'll just have to watch the movie to see the ending.Well worth watching ,but it is very bloody.Gunner  July, 2007",5,"Whew, I'm tired",1183852800,"07 8, 2007",2007,1664,"['Apocalypto', 'DVD', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'directed', 'movie', 'Apocalypto', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'tired', 'just', 'watching', 'it.The', 'movie', 'young', 'Indio', 'warrior', ""Jaguar'sPaw"", 'who', 'captured', 'Mayan', 'slavers', 'lead', 'El', 'Jefe', 'and-', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'abandoned', 'pit', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'taken', 'great', 'Mayan', 'city', 'be', 'sacrificed-', 'pass', 'village', 'apparently', 'been', 'ravaged', 'smallpox', 'pass', 'old', 'fellow', 'type', 'laughing', 'sickness.Note', 'Many', 'scholars', 'believe', 'Mayan', 'Empire', 'was', 'devastated', 'type', 'Biological', 'hazard', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one.Back', 'human', 'sacrifices', '-first', 'cut', 'out', 'heart-then', 'chop', 'heads', 'throw', 'down', 'steps', 'Then', 'throw', 'headless', 'body', 'steps.Just', 'Mayans', 'are', 'getting', 'ready', 'cut', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 's', 'heart', 'solar', 'eclipse', 'interpret', 'Sun', 'God', 'being', 'satiated', 'take', 'prisoners', 'gauntlet', 'run', 'life', 'Fortunately', ""Jaguar'sPaw"", 'go', 'second', 'pair', 'quickly', 'see', 'weave', 'thereby', 'making', 'harder', 'target.Well', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'almost', 'JaguarPaw', 'kill', 'El', 'Jefe', 'son', 'finisher', 'thejungle', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'successfully', 'gauntlet', 'blackjaguar', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'there', 'was', 'such', 'animal', 'giantcataract', 'hornets', 'nest', 'enemies', 'wife', 'baby', 'inthe', 'flooded', 'pit', 'then', 'just', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'run', 'more', 'collapses', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'see', 'ending.Well', 'watching', 'very', 'bloody.Gunner', 'July', '2007']",N/A

No one slammed Spielberg for making Saving Private Ryan overly violent.And just about every review I've read about Apocalypto trashes Gibson the man, instead of reviewing the film on its own merits.I don't recall Roman Polanski (a convicted child molester) being dragged through the mud when The Pianist was released.But enough about all that...Unfortunately, Apocalypto did not live up to my high hopes.Apocalypto is basically an extremely formulaic chase film. The story also moves along with very familiar plot clich&eacute;s.The good guys are very good, the bad guys are very bad. The good guy escapes, gets revenge, and saves his family. It's not a great film, but it's well done for what it is.Personally, I'm very interested in Mayan culture, having visited several sites in Mexico and Belize.In terms of the way the Mayans were represented in the film, I thought it was a bit over the top.While the Mayans were a very war-like culture, and they did perform human sacrifice, there's no evidence that they would sacrifice hundreds of people at a time.Since this is the first major motion picture about the Mayans, I fear that uninformed folks will walk away thinking of the Mayans as one huge death cult. With all of the achievements of the Mayans, they deserve better.In terms of violence, I'm not squeamish, but there were several moments where I thought, ""Well, that wasn't necessary, was it?""If a jaguar bites a man's face, do I really need a close up of the dude's jaw bones getting crushed in the cat's mouth? I don't think so.All that said... I have to congratulate Mel for focusing the Mayans, creating a movie using all unknown actors, and using the Mayan language.That in itself is a huge achievement.

1005673,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000GNOKQG,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[5, 8]","Hide the children and the faint-hearted! APOCALYPTO is the most harrowing, viscerally violent film I've seen outside of several Italian exploitation flicks and that opening sequence in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. APOCALYPTO is an epic movie which narrates the savage adventures of a young hunter, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), in the waning age of the Mayan civilization - it tells of the disruption of Jaguar Paw and his fellow villagers' simple existence as they are captured by an invasive war party and of Jaguar Paw's torturous journey back to his pregnant young wife and son as his captors mercilessly go on the chase.APOCALYPTO was strenuously filmed in the Mexican state of Veracruz and the rainforests of Catemaco; director Mel Gibson was conscientious about hiring a cast comprised entirely of native actors and, much like in the ambitious use of Aramaic in PASSION OF THE CHRIST, having them speak in Yucatec Maya (with English sub-titles), thus lending immense credibility and authenticity to the picture. The glory and savagery of the Mayan culture are in full depiction here as we are treated to majestic temples and pyramids rising up in cinematic grandeur, followed by intense, gory scenes of unhinged violence and vicious sacrifices (decapitations, eviscerations, bodies being pierced, and, in one brutal moment, a face being bit off by a jaguar - *yech*).Tinged with prophecy and doom and resplendent with truly spectacular cinematography, APOCALYPTO is also well served by the acting performances of the unknown cast. A standout, of course, is pow-wow singer and artist Rudy Youngblood, who  makes his acting debut here and boldly carries the film. Dalia Hernandez (Seven, Jaguar Paw's pregnant wife) also acts for the first time and acquits herself well. Raoul Trujillo, on the other hand, is an experienced actor who is appropriately fearsome as the leader of the Holcane warriors, Zero Wolf.The fully realized APOCALYPTO is guaranteed to transport the viewer back hundreds of years to an ancient culture, of which downfall has been cloaked in mystery and conjecture. It's quite an experience. Mel Gibson dips his hand once again in riveting myth-making. The first half of the film is punctuated by awesome world-building as Gibson delves into the Mayan culture, with particular emphasis on the ruling priesthood who insist that more and yet more sacrifices will stave off doom to their declining way of life. The last half of the movie, however, does devolve into basically an extended chase sequence, however harrowing and thrilling. That Jaguar Paw can sure take a licking.This film may be too intense and graphic for some viewers. Several of my friends thought APOCALYPTO too gratuitous in its violence but I feel that the graphic nature was required to drive Gibson's particular vision home. Else, this probably would've been reduced to being a watered-down cultural film. Think what you will of Mel Gibson, he is a great filmmaker who will not stint on his cinematic visions. And, in that purview, I do respect him. APOCALYPTO is unrelentingly violent, thought-provoking, dream-like at times, and truly majestic. And, for my money, it's a near-masterpiece.",5,A near-masterpiece - Gibson goes all out,1165622400,"12 9, 2006",2006,3176,"['children', 'faint-hearted', 'APOCALYPTO', 'most', 'harrowing', 'viscerally', 'violent', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'Italian', 'exploitation', 'flicks', 'opening', 'sequence', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'APOCALYPTO', 'epic', 'movie', 'savage', 'adventures', 'young', 'hunter', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'Rudy', 'Youngblood', 'waning', 'age', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'disruption', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'fellow', 'villagers', 'simple', 'existence', 'are', 'captured', 'invasive', 'war', 'party', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'torturous', 'journey', 'back', 'pregnant', 'young', 'wife', 'son', 'captors', 'mercilessly', 'go', 'chase.APOCALYPTO', 'was', 'strenuously', 'filmed', 'Mexican', 'state', 'Veracruz', 'rainforests', 'Catemaco', 'director', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'was', 'conscientious', 'hiring', 'cast', 'comprised', 'entirely', 'native', 'actors', 'much', 'ambitious', 'use', 'Aramaic', 'PASSION', 'THE', 'CHRIST', 'having', 'speak', 'Yucatec', 'Maya', 'English', 'sub-titles', 'thus', 'lending', 'immense', 'credibility', 'authenticity', 'picture', 'glory', 'savagery', 'Mayan', 'culture', 'are', 'full', 'depiction', 'here', 'are', 'treated', 'majestic', 'temples', 'pyramids', 'rising', 'up', 'cinematic', 'grandeur', 'followed', 'intense', 'gory', 'scenes', 'unhinged', 'violence', 'vicious', 'sacrifices', 'decapitations', 'eviscerations', 'bodies', 'being', 'pierced', 'one', 'brutal', 'moment', 'face', 'being', 'bit', 'off', 'jaguar', '*yech*', '.Tinged', 'prophecy', 'doom', 'resplendent', 'truly', 'spectacular', 'cinematography', 'APOCALYPTO', 'also', 'well', 'served', 'acting', 'performances', 'unknown', 'cast', 'standout', 'course', 'pow-wow', 'singer', 'artist', 'Rudy', 'Youngblood', 'who', 'acting', 'debut', 'here', 'boldly', 'film', 'Dalia', 'Hernandez', 'Seven', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'also', 'first', 'time', 'acquits', 'well', 'Raoul', 'Trujillo', 'other', 'hand', 'experienced', 'actor', 'who', 'appropriately', 'fearsome', 'leader', 'Holcane', 'warriors', 'Zero', 'Wolf.The', 'fully', 'realized', 'APOCALYPTO', 'guaranteed', 'transport', 'viewer', 'back', 'hundreds', 'years', 'ancient', 'culture', 'downfall', 'been', 'cloaked', 'mystery', 'conjecture', 'quite', 'experience', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'hand', 'once', 'again', 'riveting', 'myth-making', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'punctuated', 'awesome', 'world-building', 'Gibson', 'Mayan', 'culture', 'particular', 'emphasis', 'ruling', 'priesthood', 'who', 'insist', 'more', 'yet', 'more', 'sacrifices', 'will', 'stave', 'off', 'doom', 'declining', 'way', 'life', 'last', 'half', 'movie', 'however', 'devolve', 'basically', 'extended', 'chase', 'sequence', 'however', 'harrowing', 'thrilling', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'can', 'sure', 'take', 'licking.This', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'intense', 'graphic', 'viewers', 'Several', 'friends', 'thought', 'APOCALYPTO', 'too', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'feel', 'graphic', 'nature', 'was', 'required', 'drive', 'Gibson', 'particular', 'vision', 'home', 'Else', 'probably', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'reduced', 'being', 'watered-down', 'cultural', 'film', 'Think', 'what', 'will', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'great', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'stint', 'cinematic', 'visions', 'purview', 'do', 'respect', 'APOCALYPTO', 'unrelentingly', 'violent', 'thought-provoking', 'dream-like', 'times', 'truly', 'majestic', 'money', 'near-masterpiece']",N/A

Problem is, I expected this to be completely centered on the legacy of the Mayan civilization and its mythical, mysterious destruction.  If I went to see a film about the Egyptian pyramids, I would hope to leave with some new ideas and perhaps some secret revelations revealed.  While ""Apocalypto"" does hint at the Mayan downfall with scenes of rotting bodies, disease, and corrupt practices...there is no light shed on why the civilization so abruptly disappeared.  I am not asking for solid evidence of the destruction of a civilization, but perhaps a new theory on ""why"".  In essence , while the film does a great job of ""hinting"" the demise of the Mayan empire, it does an even better job of detailing the interactions between the Mayan ""kidnappers"" and their captives.  The conflict between these two groups reveals some of the most charismatic moments in the film.  I could not get enough of Jaguar Paw, our ""jungle hero"" fighting for his life against his Mayan nemesis for his life and family.  Surely if these actors were unknowns before this film, they will not be for long.  Gibson has a remarkable way of finding actors with no training and directing Oscar-worthy performances from them.  Like ""The Passion"", he again succeeds in not only bringing a subtitled film successfully to a mainstream audience, but he introduces to some of the most memorable moments on film delivered by actors unknown to the entertainment world.

On APOCALYPTO, his third milestone masterpiece, Gibson creates a most stunning, provocative portrait of what his instincts and genius gift of vision bring to reality in present tense what most likely is an accurate picture of the lost Mayan civilization in the jungles hundreds of years past. Other than what the Middle Ages explorers, conquerors and settlers wrote of the New World in their detailed journals for future generations to learn, we may never know what and how the Mayan world truly looked during the time set in APOCALYPTO, but, Gibson's visual recreation appears an exact and precise wonder to behold, and almost just as great as being there to witness a bit of the time and events depicted. Gibson's devotion to the most intimate, minute details of recreating a world he and his audience never lived in are mind boggling and never fail to touch on all aspects of the human condition and emotion. Mel Gibson is not only a visual perfectionist, he also maintains the integrety of the native dialects or spoken language of the times in his master epics. His films inspire and speak volumes for themselves upon viewing. Gibson captures our imagination through his blunt, realistic bird's eye view of whatever subject haunts him to research and bring to the silver screen for his devoted audience to behold. We are so enraptured in his art that we can't help but follow with fascination. He could easily create another incredible epic of universal acclaim if he decides to produce the Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Civilization in one of his future cinematic endeavors. Mel Gibson was only warming up, observing, learning and absorbing during his era of role playing in front of the camera through the first phase of his film career. He will continue to amaze us with his wondrous epics of sights and sounds for the remainder of his illustrious and spectacular career, whether in front, or behind the camera.",5,Mel Gibson: Ultimate Visionary Movie Producer,1179964800,"05 24, 2007",2007,2056,"['Mel', 'Gibson', 'ultimate', 'visionary', 'movie', 'making', 'easily', 'eclipsed', 'peers', 'BRAVEHEART', 'PASSION', 'THE', 'CHRIST', 'APOCALYPTO', 'APOCALYPTO', 'third', 'milestone', 'masterpiece', 'Gibson', 'most', 'stunning', 'provocative', 'portrait', 'what', 'instincts', 'genius', 'gift', 'vision', 'bring', 'reality', 'present', 'tense', 'what', 'most', 'likely', 'accurate', 'picture', 'lost', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'jungles', 'hundreds', 'years', 'past', 'Other', 'what', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'explorers', 'conquerors', 'settlers', 'wrote', 'New', 'World', 'detailed', 'journals', 'future', 'generations', 'learn', 'may', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'how', 'Mayan', 'world', 'truly', 'looked', 'time', 'set', 'APOCALYPTO', 'Gibson', 'visual', 'recreation', 'exact', 'precise', 'wonder', 'behold', 'almost', 'just', 'as', 'great', 'being', 'witness', 'bit', 'time', 'events', 'depicted', 'Gibson', 'devotion', 'most', 'intimate', 'minute', 'details', 'recreating', 'world', 'audience', 'never', 'lived', 'are', 'mind', 'boggling', 'never', 'fail', 'touch', 'aspects', 'human', 'condition', 'emotion', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'not', 'only', 'visual', 'perfectionist', 'also', 'integrety', 'native', 'dialects', 'spoken', 'language', 'times', 'master', 'epics', 'films', 'inspire', 'speak', 'volumes', 'viewing', 'Gibson', 'imagination', 'blunt', 'realistic', 'bird', 'eye', 'view', 'subject', 'research', 'bring', 'silver', 'screen', 'devoted', 'audience', 'behold', 'are', 'so', 'enraptured', 'art', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'follow', 'fascination', 'could', 'easily', 'create', 'incredible', 'epic', 'universal', 'acclaim', 'produce', 'Spanish', 'Conquest', 'Aztec', 'Civilization', 'one', 'future', 'cinematic', 'endeavors', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'was', 'only', 'warming', 'up', 'observing', 'learning', 'absorbing', 'era', 'role', 'playing', 'front', 'camera', 'first', 'phase', 'film', 'career', 'will', 'continue', 'amaze', 'wondrous', 'epics', 'sights', 'sounds', 'remainder', 'illustrious', 'spectacular', 'career', 'front', 'camera']",N/A

He came in one day and asked if I had seen Apocalypto, and when I answered no he said, ""you have to watch it on the big screen, do NOT wait until it comes out on DVD.""  He went on to tell me that despite the fact that the entire movie was subtitled, that it would hold your interest throughout.  Boy was he right.The opening sequence is intense, and within just a few minutes you realize that you are in for alot of gore and alot of action.  Unlike some of the previous revieweres, I don't believe that the gore is meant simply for gore's sake.  I actually feel that the gore and violence in the movie very well portrays the violence that probably occured around that time.Either way, the most interesting part of the movie, in my opinion, is the backdrop of the time.  This was the time when the first conquistadores were arriving in American and threatening the way of life of the Mayas and Aztecs.  I personally would have enjoyed more of this part of the story.  For example, how did these people react to the men invading their land, bringing with them new customs, new religion, and devastating diseases.  Having said that, the movie does a superb job in portraying the despair that the Mayans felt when they reailzed that their way of life and even entire villages were rapidly dissapearing, if at the hands of their own.

As  an actor I've always admired his ability, as a director I admire Mel Gibson even more so, in his completer determination to tell the story as it really is, and lets face it,  the ancient Aztec Peoples as portrayed in Mel Gibson film 'Apocalypto' is really raw, but when investigate archaeologist findings of this ancient Aztec civilization previous to colonial times, this civilization was doing no more then any civilization of its time whether this cultural reality can be compared to  Europe, India,  China, or Asia,  Mel Gibson's film simply tells it like it was, even if what it was in the Ancient Aztec Civilization was raw, bloody, and very graphic.  The  Ancient Aztec Civilization believed in human sacrifice, that in a manner of speaking was their communion with God &#8211; the film definitely portrays that reality and Mel Gibson as a director does not hold back from telling that very real truth by way of film making.

Worth a watch, and enjoyable for the most part, it does feature several drawbacks that hamper one's enjoyment of the film.  The first is that the movie is just too damn long.  It seems to take forever for Jaguar Paw and his fellow raiders to get to the top of the pyramid (right before the best-timed eclipse ever) so that the real meat of the movie can begin.  Character development is nice, but the journey to the pyramid seems to take forever and bad pacing never helps one's enjoyment of the film.Even more annoying was the gigantic plot hole that made no sense to me whatsoever.  You see, before being captured Jaguar Paw lowered his wife and child down into a giant pit in the ground so that the rival tribe wouldn't kill/rape them.  About halfway through the movie the pit starts filling up with water, which the audience is supposed to view as a bad thing that increases tension and gives Jaguar Paw urgency to get back home.  Why?  The water should A. let his wife and child live longer, as it will allow them to drink and B. allow them to reach the surface when the pit fills all the way.  Instead we're supposed to believe they're in danger of drowning--why?  They live right near a river and the gulf of mexico: they know how to swim and how to tread water.  Sure it might make sleeping somewhat difficult, but they should be in no immediate danger whatsoever.

I went into Apocalypto with a skeptical mind, but have to admit, I was blown away by this movie.Not for the faint of heart, Apocalypto tells the story of one man's (played superbly by Rudy Youngblood) journey from the quiet, serene woodsman life he and his tribe lead, to literally the steps of human hell and his narrow escape from it. Graphic, horrific, and yet deeply beautiful, Apocalypto is a fast paced rollercoaster ride that grabs you and doesn't let go.My only issue with this movie is it's presentation of a wicked and evil Mayan civilization, which is sheer interpretation and speculation, and I wonder how a movie showing Christian led sacrifices and attrocities would go over with the public.

It was the Aztecs, not the Mayans, who were kidnapping, enslaving and sacrificing minority tribesmen in the years before the Spanish conquest. The Mayans sacrificed humans too, but, although there are still millions of people who speak Mayan dialects in Central America to this day, their civilization collapsed about six hundred years before the arrival of Cortez.The human sacrifices that are depicted in Apocalypto are not an ""exaggeration"" of history. The law of the Aztec Empire, for example, mandated a thousand human sacrifices to the god Huitzilopchtli in every town with a temple, every year. The largest mass sacrifice that was documented by the Aztecs themselves occured in 1487, just a few years before the arrival of the Europeans: On the occasion of the dedication of the immense Temple of Huitzilopochtli in Tenochtitlan (what is now Mexico City), eighty-thousand men were killed over a four-day, four-night period. By all accounts, sacrifice victims had their ""heart torn out while still beating and held up for all to see,"" and their ""body was kicked over the edge of the temple platform where it bounced and slithered...down the steps."" The only detail that Mel Gibson leaves out is the cannibalism.But Apocalypto is about a lot more than the slavery and genocide that preceded the European conquest. It is an action adventure thriller like no other.When a Central American village is raided for slaves and sacrifice victims by Mayans, one of the villagers, Jaguar Paw, hides his pregnant wife and child in a deep hole in the ground. Jaguar Paw must then escape from his captors and return to save his wife and children before they die from exposure and starvation.Mel Gibson usually makes great movies, but he really outdid himself with this one. Apocalypto is his geatest film to date. It is sad that many will miss this film because of the unfortunate drunk driving incident. Many are intent to boycott Mr. Gibson, and, in a free country, we should be free to watch or not watch movies for any reason we choose.

Therefore, the more you can live in its reality moment to moment, vs. anticipating scenes described in a review or watched in a preview, the greater will be your enjoyment.My tip -- if you haven't already seen ""Apocalypto"" -- SEE this film. And buy the DVD when it comes out. THEN read Stephen Hunter's review in the Washington Post online. THEN enjoy these Amazon reviews and their richness of observation and updates on where Mayan scholarship takes us today.As others here have noted, my husband and I spent hours afterward discussing the film and what Gibson was trying to say about hunting and being hunted, and about a pre-Columbian world in its last moments before contact.We have visited Tulum, Coba, Chichen Itza and Edzna (I've been to Uxmal on my own), and of course read numerous articles about the Maya in ""National Geographic"" (which I call ""Maya Geographic"").If you have seen Tikal rising from the jungle, or Coba still partly submerged in jungle, you may be enthralled to see ""Apocalypto"" recreate a living Mayan city at the peak of its glory.My husband has many books about the Maya, including Bernal Diaz's amazing ""The Discovery and Conquest of Mexico: 1517-1521."" He also gave me John L. Stevens' ""Incidents of Travel in the Yucatan.""Both of these spur intriguing questions about parallel evolution, whereby the Maya independently created pyramids, astronomical measurements and other civilizational advancements without cultural contact with Egypt, Mesopotamia, etc.It will be interesting to see if ""Apocalypto"" drums up additional travel to the Yucatan and other areas where 6 million Maya live on today. It's quite stunning to see the faces and profiles of the actors, as well as their clothes and makeup, look so much like suddenly living visions of the glyphs carved on rock in numerous Maya sites. It's enough to make one gasp out loud.My husband noted two points about this film:  It's similarity to ""The Naked Prey,"" and the possible unlikelihood of a forest-dwelling Maya not being familiar with the big cities, given the mobility and trade connections throughout the Yucatan.

1005697,AQ38OU6SRFGU5,B000GNOKQG,"Jeffery E. Blascyk ""the Shamrock kid""","[4, 4]","Apocolipto is the newest film by actor/director Mel Gibson.  I didn't have the pleasure to see this on the big screen, so I missed out.  This movie falls into the historic realm of criticism for continuity and what we know to be true about the Mayan people.  This is ridiculous to me because it's always films like this that they criticize.  First off the film is accurate with most things.  The way the culture was at the height of there existence, the way their religion dictated their laws and how they treated people that lived within that culture, the weapons used are very accurate and even the colors depicted in the film are colors they could have access to by extracted them from various plants and animal organs. The materials used like stone, jade and a super hard and sharp glass element that was prevalent in this region that was used for weapons and other cutting tools.  He also uses the native Mayan tongue throughout the entire film.To me Mel did a wonderful job in keeping this story and look of the film as real as possible.  The biggest problems these sudo-historians complain about are that the Spanish conquistadors would not have been in the Yucatan at this time.  When they arrived, the Mayan culture was already declining. Many historians believe that is how they got wiped off the face of the planet, their culture was not working as a whole anymore and was cannibalizing itself with war and ramped disease.  They were destroying themselves long before the Spanish arrived.  Mel Gibson didn't put a time stamp on this film on purpose. I believe he wanted to show the Mayan at their height and suggest through a few keys scenes in the film that they are headed for a rude awaking.  I think the film is an honest look at these people that we know little about and how their culture is beautiful yet barbaric, much like our own.  No matter how much power you have, if your culture is not strong from within, your culture is destine to meet its demise.Gibson shows me two things in this film.  First and foremost he is a suburb director and knows how to tell a compelling story with just images.  Take out all the subtitles and this film still is entertaining not to mention you would be about to grasp most, if not all, of the major plot points.  This skill in storytelling is foreign to most directors that make their bones doing the typical Hollywood action movie.  Secondly, Gibson is not afraid to direct a film with somewhat obscure setting and subject matter using little knows actors playing larger than life characters with tons of close-up ""hero"" shots.  This film is compelling and moving, anytime you can connect with people that have been gone for 500 plus years you are doing your job as a director.  The Action never stops in this film and the brutality Mel gets criticized for is an honest reflection of this culture. This film is almost flawless in its execution and should have gotten more praise than it did.  The best type of ending to a movie is when it leaves you guessing, wondering but yet satisfied that you've come to a concussion of this story.  You get closure from the film and the characters you invested time into but also know there is still questions to be answered.  I wish more films were done with such care, precision, passion and admiration for the subject matter.  This film was ambitious and the end product is a masterful piece of hardcore action/adventure entertainment. If you want to see a truly brutal film, wait until they make an accurate depiction of what the Spanish/European conquerors and explores did to the indigenous people of this region and North America as a whole.  Then you'll see brutality.",5,A passionate piece of filmmaking,1188172800,"08 27, 2007",2007,3672,"['Apocolipto', 'newest', 'film', 'actor/director', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'pleasure', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'missed', 'out', 'movie', 'historic', 'realm', 'criticism', 'continuity', 'what', 'know', 'be', 'true', 'Mayan', 'people', 'ridiculous', 'always', 'films', 'criticize', 'First', 'film', 'accurate', 'most', 'things', 'way', 'culture', 'was', 'height', 'existence', 'way', 'religion', 'dictated', 'laws', 'how', 'treated', 'people', 'lived', 'culture', 'weapons', 'used', 'are', 'very', 'accurate', 'even', 'colors', 'depicted', 'film', 'are', 'colors', 'could', 'have', 'access', 'extracted', 'various', 'plants', 'animal', 'organs', 'materials', 'used', 'stone', 'jade', 'super', 'hard', 'sharp', 'glass', 'element', 'was', 'prevalent', 'region', 'was', 'used', 'weapons', 'other', 'cutting', 'tools', 'also', 'native', 'Mayan', 'tongue', 'entire', 'film.To', 'Mel', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'keeping', 'story', 'look', 'film', 'as', 'real', 'possible', 'biggest', 'problems', 'sudo-historians', 'complain', 'are', 'Spanish', 'conquistadors', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'Yucatan', 'time', 'When', 'arrived', 'Mayan', 'culture', 'was', 'already', 'declining', 'Many', 'historians', 'believe', 'how', 'got', 'wiped', 'face', 'planet', 'culture', 'was', 'not', 'working', 'whole', 'anymore', 'was', 'cannibalizing', 'war', 'ramped', 'disease', 'were', 'destroying', 'long', 'Spanish', 'arrived', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'time', 'stamp', 'film', 'purpose', 'believe', 'wanted', 'show', 'Mayan', 'height', 'suggest', 'few', 'keys', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'headed', 'rude', 'awaking', 'think', 'film', 'honest', 'look', 'people', 'know', 'little', 'how', 'culture', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'barbaric', 'much', 'own', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'power', 'have', 'culture', 'not', 'strong', 'culture', 'destine', 'meet', 'demise.Gibson', 'shows', 'two', 'things', 'film', 'First', 'foremost', 'suburb', 'director', 'how', 'tell', 'compelling', 'story', 'just', 'images', 'Take', 'out', 'subtitles', 'film', 'still', 'entertaining', 'not', 'mention', 'would', 'be', 'grasp', 'most', 'not', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'skill', 'storytelling', 'foreign', 'most', 'directors', 'make', 'bones', 'doing', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'movie', 'Secondly', 'Gibson', 'not', 'afraid', 'direct', 'film', 'somewhat', 'obscure', 'setting', 'subject', 'matter', 'using', 'little', 'knows', 'actors', 'playing', 'larger', 'life', 'characters', 'tons', 'close-up', 'hero', 'shots', 'film', 'compelling', 'moving', 'anytime', 'can', 'connect', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'gone', '500', 'years', 'are', 'doing', 'job', 'director', 'Action', 'never', 'film', 'brutality', 'Mel', 'criticized', 'honest', 'reflection', 'culture', 'film', 'almost', 'flawless', 'execution', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'more', 'praise', 'did', 'best', 'type', 'ending', 'movie', 'when', 'guessing', 'wondering', 'yet', 'satisfied', ""'ve"", 'come', 'concussion', 'story', 'get', 'closure', 'film', 'characters', 'invested', 'time', 'also', 'know', 'still', 'questions', 'be', 'answered', 'wish', 'more', 'films', 'were', 'done', 'such', 'care', 'precision', 'passion', 'admiration', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'was', 'ambitious', 'end', 'product', 'masterful', 'piece', 'hardcore', 'action/adventure', 'entertainment', 'want', 'see', 'truly', 'brutal', 'film', 'wait', 'make', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'what', 'Spanish/European', 'conquerors', 'explores', 'did', 'indigenous', 'people', 'region', 'North', 'America', 'whole', 'Then', ""'ll"", 'see', 'brutality']",N/A

Somehow, in between horror freaks and hungry arthouse schoolers, you have this film fit into. What audiance is that? I wonder how well this film will do. I saw this film on the first Saturday it opened, during the afternoon. It was half filled. Pretty good, considering how informed audiences tend to be. I'm sure more than half of them knew about the vomit enducing violence. And about Gibson's tirade(s).I've read it's an ""Arthouse film for Jocks."" It certainly brings the action for the jocks, and the after movie gossip fuel. It also has been out there in mainstream news for a bit. It's been delayed for how long? And was it rain? Hmmm, Public corespondent.... Not to mention how even before it was released, nations of outraged people were denouncing it. I'm gonna stay away from taking any sides. As a movie, it deserves a shot. But, maybe it's impossible for me to see it again. I don't mean that in a bad way. I mean it in a ""Passion"" way. Gibson is a determined man, who choses to apply his fortunes to projects no-one, I mean no-one would touch with a ten foot pole.",5,Mel Gibson seems to be the only person making these kinds of films.

""A New Yorker""","[2, 2]","First off when this film first came out the teaser was misleading, the trailer also does not really leads the viewer to what this movie is about. The poster does not help either. My impression was, this movie is some Sci-Fi fantasy about Maya, probably something not close, but similar to ""Stargate"". The poster even made me think of ""Alien vs. Predator"".Instead the movie is portraying the ancient world of Mesoamerican people, as well as tracking the end of the ancient civilizations, through the story of Jaguar's Paw - a captured warrior in a rescue to his family. It doesn't portray the fall of the Mayan Empire, it's not supposed to, it just tells a story, It does not set out to be a history of the arrival of European's in the Mayan area. Horrific as it may be, it's a love story at the end of the day along with a lot of action. Even then, much of the violence is Shakespearean and takes place just off-camera. For instance, you see women being carried off in the rape-and-pillage scene and you hear their cries but you don't see them being raped and murdered. Battles are staged much as they were in ""Braveheart."" And yes, there's a beating heart lifted from a sacrificed man's chest by a blood-streaked Mayan shaman, but moviegoers saw the same thing in Spielberg's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom; it got a PG rating and we read no critical hysterics about ""lunatic violence."" On the whole, you'll see as much blood and gore on the average CSI episode.After watching this film, it probably should have been titled ""Jaguar Paw's Great Adventure."" The glimpses Gibson provides of Mayan civilization are jaw-dropping. You won't ever see a more convincing cinematic evocation of another time and place in such scope and meticulous detail. Every face seems to have a complete history as Jaguar Paw is marched through the Mayan city. A well-to-do Mayan woman does nothing more than look at the prisoners from her doorway but the story her face tells is voluminous.Mel Gibson has done the impossible. He has created a tale of the Maya's people in different dimension. As an historical observation, the film is brilliant, depicting the violence in most of the movie. Finally, as a work of art, this film is unparalleled. ""Apocalypto"" will move you. I found it to be one of the most beautiful films I needed to see even though it took me some time to view it but I'm happy that I did. Its dialogue is entirely in Mayan language with English subtitles, a remarkably bold decision by Gibson, and one that pays dividends. On one level it unites an international cast, sparing us any clashing accents, and gives the film a greater sense of authenticity. On another, it forced Gibson and his team into a very visual form of storytelling; even amongst the carnage there are shots of aching beauty. If you still haven't seen it then I suggest you give this one a try.

Whatever you think of Mel Gibson's messed-up personal life, the guy is a creative genius.Apocalypto is set in the pre-Columbian Mayan peninsula, and opens in a small Indian village whose young men are out in the jungle hunting a wild boar, led by their chief Flint Sky and his son Jaguar Paw. They encounter something else they never expected -- a party of terrified refugees whose village has been raided and destroyed. Little do they know that the fate of those refugees is about to hit their own tribe.In a pre-dawn raid the very next day, their own village is attacked by a war party of Indians from another tribe. Most of the adults, including Flint Sky, are killed, the children are spared, and Jaguar Paw, after managing to hide his pregnant wife and little son down a dry well, is captured along with some twenty other people in his tribe and dragged off to the Mayan capital. There they come upon a culture they never knew existed, vastly superior to their own, and built on a caste system that depends heavily on slave labor. But they realize they haven't been captured to be slaves -- they are human sacrifices to the Mayan god Kukulkan. Spared by a solar eclipse, Jaguar Paw and a few survivors of the carnage in Kukulkan's temple are turned over to the war party who make a game of them dodging spears and arrows before they are all killed. Only Jaguar Paw manages to flip the script, and in a stunning act of defiance of fate, kills the son of the war party's chief and escapes into the forest, with nine warriors after him screaming for his head.From there the film takes on an eerie resemblance to ""The Naked Prey"" with overtones of Xenophon's ""Anabasis"", with Jaguar Paw running home ahead of the pursuing party through hostile territory, trying to stay alive long enough to get back home in time to rescue his wife and son. And in a thrilling plot twist, once he manages to get back to familiar territory, the tables are turned when Jaguar Paw has the home-field advantage and the hunters turn into the hunted.The acting and directing in this film could not be improved upon. Rudy Youngblood gives a knockout performance as Jaguar Paw, caught up in a hell he never imagined and intent only on getting back to his world and his family. Raoul Trujillo and Gerardo Taracena are chilling as the pursuing warriors Zero Wolf and Middle Eye, and Morris Yellowbirdhead is excellent as Flint Sky. Gibson even got great performances from the children, especially Carlos Emilio Baez as Jaguar Paw's little son, and Maria Isidra Hoil and Aquetzali Garcia, who share the role of the Oracle Girl; their eerie voices (""You fear me? So you should, all you who are vile... would you like to know how you are going to die?"") send shivers down your spine. The Indian village and the Mayan city are so convincingly portrayed that we can feel just what it would be like living in either place. And the haunting sound track helps to make us feel we're deep in the middle of 15th century meso-America.Taken as a whole, Apocalypto is a knockout film experience. Don't see it for its historical accuracy (inaccuracies abound in this movie); see it for what it is, a glorious action-adventure film that will keep you mesmerized from beginning to end.Judy Lind",5,Mind-blowing film-making,1310342400,"07 11, 2011",2011,3358,"['ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'movie', 'completely', 'shoes', 'as', 'thoroughly', 'did', 'Apocalypto', 'think', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'messed-up', 'personal', 'life', 'guy', 'creative', 'genius.Apocalypto', 'set', 'pre-Columbian', 'Mayan', 'peninsula', 'small', 'Indian', 'village', 'young', 'men', 'are', 'out', 'jungle', 'hunting', 'wild', 'boar', 'led', 'chief', 'Flint', 'Sky', 'son', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'encounter', 'something', 'else', 'never', 'expected', 'party', 'terrified', 'refugees', 'village', 'been', 'raided', 'destroyed', 'Little', 'do', 'know', 'fate', 'refugees', 'hit', 'own', 'tribe.In', 'pre-dawn', 'raid', 'very', 'next', 'day', 'own', 'village', 'attacked', 'war', 'party', 'Indians', 'tribe', 'Most', 'adults', 'including', 'Flint', 'Sky', 'are', 'killed', 'children', 'are', 'spared', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'managing', 'hide', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'little', 'son', 'down', 'dry', 'well', 'captured', 'twenty', 'other', 'people', 'tribe', 'dragged', 'off', 'Mayan', 'capital', 'come', 'culture', 'never', 'knew', 'existed', 'vastly', 'superior', 'own', 'built', 'caste', 'system', 'heavily', 'slave', 'labor', 'realize', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'captured', 'be', 'slaves', 'are', 'human', 'sacrifices', 'Mayan', 'god', 'Kukulkan', 'Spared', 'solar', 'eclipse', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'few', 'survivors', 'carnage', 'Kukulkan', 'temple', 'are', 'turned', 'war', 'party', 'who', 'make', 'game', 'dodging', 'spears', 'arrows', 'are', 'killed', 'Only', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'flip', 'script', 'stunning', 'act', 'defiance', 'fate', 'son', 'war', 'party', 'chief', 'forest', 'nine', 'warriors', 'screaming', 'head.From', 'film', 'eerie', 'resemblance', 'Naked', 'Prey', 'overtones', 'Xenophon', 'Anabasis', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'running', 'home', 'ahead', 'pursuing', 'party', 'hostile', 'territory', 'trying', 'stay', 'alive', 'long', 'enough', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'time', 'rescue', 'wife', 'son', 'thrilling', 'plot', 'twist', 'once', 'get', 'back', 'familiar', 'territory', 'tables', 'are', 'turned', 'when', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'home-field', 'advantage', 'hunters', 'turn', 'hunted.The', 'acting', 'directing', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'improved', 'Rudy', 'Youngblood', 'knockout', 'performance', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'caught', 'up', 'hell', 'never', 'imagined', 'intent', 'only', 'getting', 'back', 'world', 'family', 'Raoul', 'Trujillo', 'Gerardo', 'Taracena', 'are', 'chilling', 'pursuing', 'warriors', 'Zero', 'Wolf', 'Middle', 'Eye', 'Morris', 'Yellowbirdhead', 'excellent', 'Flint', 'Sky', 'Gibson', 'even', 'got', 'great', 'performances', 'children', 'especially', 'Carlos', 'Emilio', 'Baez', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'little', 'son', 'Maria', 'Isidra', 'Hoil', 'Aquetzali', 'Garcia', 'who', 'share', 'role', 'Oracle', 'Girl', 'eerie', 'voices', 'fear', 'should', 'who', 'are', 'vile', 'would', 'know', 'how', 'are', 'going', 'die', 'send', 'shivers', 'down', 'spine', 'Indian', 'village', 'Mayan', 'city', 'are', 'so', 'convincingly', 'portrayed', 'can', 'feel', 'just', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'living', 'place', 'haunting', 'sound', 'track', 'make', 'feel', ""'re"", 'deep', 'middle', '15th', 'century', 'meso-America.Taken', 'whole', 'Apocalypto', 'knockout', 'film', 'experience', 'Do', ""n't"", 'see', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'inaccuracies', 'abound', 'movie', 'see', 'what', 'glorious', 'action-adventure', 'film', 'will', 'keep', 'mesmerized', 'beginning', 'end.Judy', 'Lind']",N/A

It is a film about the decline of the Mayan civilization, tribes attacking other tribes, brutal violence, gore, human sacrifice, and primitive warfare - usually involving a lot of death.  There are several Latinas and Latinos in this film (some were genuine Mayan people), along with over 700 extras, with a lot of careful emphasis on realism during the making of the film.  The jungle scenes and sets used were in Mexico, and right down to the last detail it is obvious the amount of effort invested in wardrobe, make-up, and even the Mayan language used in the film was heavily researched to be as authentic as possible.  With a budget of over $ 40 mil, this DVD movie impresses nearly any audience willing to watch a film with subtitles (anybody in the viewing audience translate original Mayan?).  There are lots of lovely women who share their assets with the camera, however, this film makes such an effort at realism that it doesn't seem like gratuitous exploitation eye candy just for the sake of the rating.  I'm guessing the R-rating is mostly for the violence and gore.  Although some of the plot is predictable, I give this 5 stars for keeping me watching without using the FF button on the remote, even though I've seen it three times.

The film does not name the culture portrayed, though I have heard some refer to it as Mayan, but it strikes me as very ""Aztec"" in its depiction. By that, I mean that there is plenty of gore, cruelty and human sacrifice.The story is of a fairly rural village that is happy enough and getting by. One morning they awake to find that they are being raided by a war party from the ""big city"". Most of the adults are captured and led off into slavery in the big city. For the women, slavery means servitude. For the men, it is much less pleasant.The men find themselves painted blue and taken to the top of a large pyramid where the local priests are systematically sacrificing them, cutting out their hearts to burn on an altar, lopping off the heads and sending the corpses to tumble down the steps for the amusement and nourishment of the locals. When a solar eclipse is finally over with, there is no further need of the captives.The remaining men are taken out to play a game where they are promised their freedom is they successfully run a bloodthirsty gauntlet. When one of the captives manages to kill the son of a leader and make it to the woods, the chase is on.

1005714,A193A7T1E8CUTB,B000GNOKQG,John F. Frederick,"[1, 1]","or,1519: A Conquistador OdysseyOn the plus side, the main character, Jaguar Paw, is likeable. Reunion of him with his wife and children is an effective and moving moment. Photography has many beautiful shots. At moments the film conveys some vague sense of authentically capturing the demented and eerie aspects of a decaying and decadent Mayan civilization. Action plot has nice escalation. Acting and direction are both good.My difficulties with the film: (1) Not that we really get to know Jaguar Paw in any great depth, but the other characters are completely two-dimensional; they are just so many cardboard cut outs to get blown away as in a shooting gallery. The two human sacrifices shown are even played a bit from the point of view of the crass spectators depicted in the film&#8212;just something to show for the adrenalin and shock value. At best, we might be invited to feel disgust for those participating, but hardly any sympathy or humanity of the victims. Mainly it&#8217;s just a sinister parody of open heart surgery followed by rolling heads. (2) While Mayan society, by mainstream accounts, was in decay as they were practicing human sacrifices, they were also in civil war, a point which the film curiously omits--in favor of presenting the Mayan populace as, well, a bunch of dolts. Ok, so it's not supposed to be a documentary.  Yet, as is well known, the Mayans had a calendar which &#34;ran out&#34;&#8212;supposedly&#8212;Dec 21, 2012; that means, at the least, they calculated the winter solstice more than 400 years into the future. The Mayan, 'Dresden Codex,' I understand, actually contains tables for eclipses.  By contrast, the film reduces the entire civilization to idling nincompoops who invest their best their time and energy into nothing more than placating the tricks offered by a handful of bloodthirsty rainmaking frauds&#8212;frauds who hire out to scavengers to trap innocent bystanders for sacrificial victims&#8212;and frauds who while clever enough to deceive multitudes, can only stand there and look dumb if ever inconveniently faced with a natural occurrence such as a solar eclipse.  The film is a bit like watching some twisted revival of 1930's Tarzan-movie-type racist portrayals of your generic, &#34;natives,&#34; as a new and pretentious, &#34;epic.&#34; (3) The main character, though in a number of ways likable enough, is not so subtly presented as being favored&#8212;by some unnamed &#34;force,&#34; even Luke Skywalker style&#8212;yet also with absolutely no explanation as to why; it's just drummed into the audience (ad nauseam), that he has somehow been arbitrarily picked to survive Mayan depravity as well as, apparently, the Mayans getting bumped off by the Spaniards.In a word, I can only describe these aspects of the film&#8212;which pretty much take up the entire plot&#8212;as &#34;hokey.&#34; Relating them to the film's title, and reading between the lines, one might surmise some influence of Calvinist theology&#8212;where salvation is offered only to a few, rather than to all&#8212;but even this would seem completely extrinsic to the actual plot development.  The Spanish ships which appear at the end might as well be the monolith appearing in '2001: A Space Odyssey.'  While the bewilderment of Jaguar Paw and his enemies was well directed and the scene effective&#8212;you do get the sense yourself of seeing something strange as for the first time, even though what was shown was familiar to the audience&#8212;one can only wonder what the point of the scene is.  Plainly enough, the scene does serve to level the playing field between the hero and his enemies; yet is the point of the scene, then, just to see Jaguar Paw as one of Kubrick's apes?  Are we really to believe that the very concept of travelling on water was that incomprehensible and impenetrable to the flim&#8217;s hero?  In the end, it is simply not clear that Jaguar Paw&#8212;though an outsider living in a small neighboring village&#8212;is given any more respect than the other dolts in the film.The ambitious scope of the film is admirable, trying to give an eye-level view, as it were, of an ancient civilization, in its tragedy as well as in its humanity. However&#8212;though perhaps it could have been a good action flick in an unusual setting&#8212;the film just here winds up with too many irons in the fire, with even the action gratuitous and stilted. The basic direction betrays the obvious talent of a skilled film maker, but its effectiveness is cut to ribbons by a hopelessly inane plot.",2,The Last of the Mohican Mayans,1345161600,"08 17, 2012",2012,4557,"['or,1519', 'Conquistador', 'OdysseyOn', 'plus', 'side', 'main', 'character', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'likeable', 'Reunion', 'wife', 'children', 'effective', 'moving', 'moment', 'Photography', 'many', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'moments', 'film', 'conveys', 'vague', 'sense', 'authentically', 'capturing', 'demented', 'eerie', 'aspects', 'decaying', 'decadent', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'Action', 'plot', 'nice', 'escalation', 'Acting', 'direction', 'are', 'good.My', 'difficulties', 'film', '1', 'Not', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'great', 'depth', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'completely', 'two-dimensional', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'cardboard', 'cut', 'get', 'blown', 'away', 'shooting', 'gallery', 'two', 'human', 'sacrifices', 'shown', 'are', 'even', 'played', 'bit', 'point', 'view', 'crass', 'spectators', 'depicted', 'film', '8212', 'just', 'something', 'show', 'adrenalin', 'shock', 'value', 'best', 'might', 'be', 'invited', 'feel', 'disgust', 'participating', 'hardly', 'sympathy', 'humanity', 'victims', 'Mainly', '8217', 's', 'just', 'sinister', 'parody', 'open', 'heart', 'surgery', 'followed', 'rolling', 'heads', '2', 'Mayan', 'society', 'mainstream', 'accounts', 'was', 'decay', 'were', 'practicing', 'human', 'sacrifices', 'were', 'also', 'civil', 'war', 'point', 'film', 'curiously', 'favor', 'presenting', 'Mayan', 'populace', 'well', 'bunch', 'dolts', 'Ok', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'documentary', 'Yet', 'well', 'known', 'Mayans', 'had', 'calendar', '34', 'ran', 'out', '34', '8212', 'supposedly', '8212', 'Dec', '21', '2012', 'least', 'calculated', 'winter', 'solstice', 'more', '400', 'years', 'future', 'Mayan', ""'Dresden"", 'Codex', 'understand', 'actually', 'tables', 'eclipses', 'contrast', 'film', 'entire', 'civilization', 'idling', 'nincompoops', 'who', 'invest', 'best', 'time', 'energy', 'nothing', 'more', 'placating', 'tricks', 'offered', 'handful', 'bloodthirsty', 'rainmaking', 'frauds', '8212', 'frauds', 'who', 'hire', 'out', 'scavengers', 'trap', 'innocent', 'bystanders', 'sacrificial', 'victims', '8212', 'frauds', 'who', 'clever', 'enough', 'deceive', 'multitudes', 'can', 'only', 'stand', 'there', 'look', 'dumb', 'ever', 'inconveniently', 'faced', 'natural', 'occurrence', 'such', 'solar', 'eclipse', 'film', 'bit', 'watching', 'twisted', 'revival', '1930', 'Tarzan-movie-type', 'racist', 'portrayals', 'generic', '34', 'natives', '34', 'new', 'pretentious', '34', '34', '3', 'main', 'character', 'though', 'number', 'ways', 'likable', 'enough', 'not', 'so', 'subtly', 'presented', 'being', 'favored', '8212', 'unnamed', '34', 'force', '34', 'even', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'style', '8212', 'also', 'absolutely', 'explanation', 'why', 'just', 'drummed', 'audience', 'ad', 'nauseam', 'somehow', 'been', 'arbitrarily', 'picked', 'survive', 'Mayan', 'depravity', 'as', 'well', 'apparently', 'Mayans', 'getting', 'bumped', 'off', 'Spaniards.In', 'word', 'can', 'only', 'describe', 'aspects', 'film', '8212', 'pretty', 'much', 'take', 'up', 'entire', 'plot', '8212', '34', 'hokey.', '34', 'Relating', 'film', 'title', 'reading', 'lines', 'one', 'might', 'surmise', 'influence', 'Calvinist', 'theology', '8212', 'where', 'salvation', 'offered', 'only', 'few', 'rather', '8212', 'even', 'would', 'seem', 'completely', 'extrinsic', 'actual', 'plot', 'development', 'Spanish', 'ships', 'appear', 'end', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'monolith', 'appearing', ""'2001"", 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'bewilderment', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'enemies', 'was', 'well', 'directed', 'scene', 'effective', '8212', 'do', 'get', 'sense', 'yourself', 'seeing', 'something', 'strange', 'first', 'time', 'even', 'what', 'was', 'shown', 'was', 'familiar', 'audience', '8212', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'what', 'point', 'scene', 'Plainly', 'enough', 'scene', 'serve', 'level', 'playing', 'field', 'hero', 'enemies', 'point', 'scene', 'then', 'just', 'see', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'one', 'Kubrick', 'apes', 'Are', 'really', 'believe', 'very', 'concept', 'travelling', 'water', 'was', 'incomprehensible', 'impenetrable', 'flim', '8217', 'hero', 'end', 'simply', 'not', 'clear', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', '8212', 'outsider', 'living', 'small', 'neighboring', 'village', '8212', 'given', 'more', 'respect', 'other', 'dolts', 'film.The', 'ambitious', 'scope', 'film', 'admirable', 'trying', 'give', 'eye-level', 'view', 'were', 'ancient', 'civilization', 'tragedy', 'as', 'well', 'humanity', 'However', '8212', 'perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'action', 'flick', 'unusual', 'setting', '8212', 'film', 'just', 'here', 'up', 'too', 'many', 'irons', 'fire', 'even', 'action', 'gratuitous', 'stilted', 'basic', 'direction', 'obvious', 'talent', 'skilled', 'film', 'maker', 'effectiveness', 'cut', 'ribbons', 'hopelessly', 'inane', 'plot']",N/A

And all the spectacle and lavish detail that we used to associate with the legendary Cecil B. DeMille!  Very impressive, Mel!As you probably know, the story is set among the Maya Indians of Mexico and central America, just at the time of the arrival of the Spanish following in Columbus's wake.  A peaceful village of hunters is raided by the Maya of the city, who march the villagers away, selling the women as slaves and sacrificing the men to their gods (and leaving the poor children to fend for themselves, one of the more heart-wrenching aspects of the film).  The film's main character is Jaguar Paw, a young man devoted to his father, his very pregnant wife, and his small son.  When the raiders arrive, he manages to hide his wife and son away, but his father is killed before his very eyes, and he is led away with the others to the city, where a priest at the top of an imposing pyramid cuts the men's hearts out, beheads them, and shoves their bodies down the steps, to the delight of the city-dwellers.  Jaguar Paw is just about to go under the knife when a solar eclipse brings the grisly ritual to a halt.  But he is not out of harm's way, as the city warriors decide to use the captives as target practice, most of them being killed in the process.  But Jaguar Paw manages to elude them, taking to the jungle as he hurries home to find his wife and son.For a little over two hours, the movie immerses us in an exotic world.  The people speak Maya, so subtitles are required.  As in his Passion of the Christ, Gibson chooses to open the film with no credits (other than the film company logo), so we are immediately plunged into this strange time and place, where the designers spared no pains in giving us an authentic look at the customs, clothing, and hair styles of these people (including the intricate tattoos, scarring, and body-distorting jewelry).  The Maya city is awesome, with its hundreds of extras caught up joyously in the horrifying ritual slaughter.  (We can imagine DeMille looking down from heaven and saying, ""Now THAT is the way to make a movie!"")  The violence is painfully graphic--like the Aztecs, the Maya made a spectacle of cutting the hearts out of their victims and holding them aloft, to the great delight of the people.  The heads of victims are displayed on poles, and after Jaguar Paw makes his escape, he has to tread through fields of decomposing bodies.  While much of the scenery is beautiful--the lush jungle, waterfalls, the city--what takes place is gut-wrenching, not only the constant threat of human predators, but also venomous vipers and charging jaguars.  (There is a brief glimpse of an adorable jaguar cub--then cut to its bloodthirsty mother nearby.)And yet, with all the bloodshed and action, this is a movie with heart.  Jaguar Paw is not only a sturdy (and smart) action hero, but an emotional man who loves his father and can't for a moment take his mind off his wife and son (who endure their own agony waiting in their hidey-hole).  He watches as his captors kill one after another of his friends, and in the course of the film his face registers just about every emotion possible.  We want desperately for this man to escape and find some peace with his wife and son (and the unborn one, which is born in one of the most bizarre scenes in the movie, though I won't spoil that for you).I suspect the movie may offend some people, such as PETA members who will object to the opening scene of the village men hunting down a tapir (a piglike jungle beast) or to the warriors killing the mother jaguar.  Also, the movie gives a Politically Incorrect (but historically accurate) view of native Americans, who are assuredly NOT living in peace and harmony together, and who sold each other as slaves and practiced a religion of human sacrifice.  In fact, the movie ends with the sight of Spanish ships on the coast--an event the PC crowd would lament, but then, after watching the natives slaughter each other for 2 hours, we wonder how much worse the Europeans could make things.  (The fact that the Europeans ended the human sacrifices is, let us admit, a good thing.)The actors in the cast are all unknowns (to Americans, anyway), which is good, since we almost feel we are watching a documentary.  Gibson used lots of Mexican locals as extras, and they are refreshingly real in front of the camera.  One standout is a small girl, whose village has been destroyed by the raiders, who utters an eerie prophecy of doom for them.  Something in her eyes unsettles the warriors, who seem to be both superstitious and guilty. It is one of the creepiest scenes in the film, one of many which bring home the reality of the human tool taken by these raiding expeditions.  In another scene, one of the village men about to be sacrificed watches as his old mother-in-law is put on the auction block--no one buys her, so she is simply cast off, nowhere and no one to turn to in a strange place, her daughter dead, her son-in-law about to be killed.  We remember an earlier scene where she appeared to be a thorn in his side and are rather touched as she touches his shoulder as he is being led to death--she and he no longer at odds, but partners in suffering.As I watched this film, I was aware of getting much more emotionally involved in this than in the typical Die Hard or Terminator type of movie, with a high body count.  There is a high body count here also, but we get more of a feel of loss, as the people who are killed and injured aren't just one-dimensional human targets but people whose deaths matter.Way to go,

""The Magnificent""","[0, 0]","After watching this film I have come to the conclusion that Mel Gibson is the greatest director of our time, if not of all movie history. His last three films Braveheart, Passion of the Christ, and Apocalypto are stunningly original, daring, and all have a specific and unique vision which is excellently carried out. Apocalypto is an oustanding movie. The story is intriguingly original and the fast pace makes the time spent watching the film fly by. From the first moments I was captivated by the suspenseful story telling and during the scene of the villagers laughing I was laughing as hard as they were.I've heard people say that the film is very violent, which it is, but the violence is not gratuitous and most of the worst scenes(like Braveheart) are cutaways. I think this is Mel's answer to those claim the the Americas were full of tree-hugging peace loving hippie-like native americans before the Europeans came. In fact, in the final scenes the camera makes especially clear one figure on the boat of the approaching europeans- a Catholic priest. It is also notable that Mel released this film on December 12, which is the feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Patroness of the Americas,who is largely responsible for the conversion of the native peoples of central and southern america. The film was moderately predictable towards the end, but it in  no way  reduced the pleasure of watching this film. Another reason I love this movie is the positive way it portrays the mothers, self-sacrificing and truly loving.Another note: the dialogue in this film is spoken in Mayan dialect, thus subtitles are used. Even the use of this(to most of us) unfamiliar language is handled well,and never does its unfamiliarity distance us from the story. The use of the language is very believable, and it is very easy to suspend one's disbelief that these are not in fact native speakers. This is probably too violent for children, and there is some brief but not graphic nudity. I really enjoyed this film.",5,Beware of the Jaguar Man.....,1180051200,"05 25, 2007",2007,2007,"['watching', 'film', 'have', 'come', 'conclusion', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'greatest', 'director', 'time', 'not', 'movie', 'history', 'last', 'three', 'films', 'Braveheart', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'Apocalypto', 'are', 'stunningly', 'original', 'daring', 'have', 'specific', 'unique', 'vision', 'excellently', 'carried', 'out', 'Apocalypto', 'oustanding', 'movie', 'story', 'intriguingly', 'original', 'fast', 'pace', 'time', 'spent', 'watching', 'film', 'fly', 'first', 'moments', 'was', 'captivated', 'suspenseful', 'story', 'telling', 'scene', 'villagers', 'laughing', 'was', 'laughing', 'as', 'hard', 'were.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'people', 'say', 'film', 'very', 'violent', 'violence', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'most', 'worst', 'scenes', 'Braveheart', 'are', 'cutaways', 'think', 'Mel', 'answer', 'claim', 'Americas', 'were', 'full', 'tree-hugging', 'peace', 'loving', 'hippie-like', 'native', 'americans', 'Europeans', 'came', 'fact', 'final', 'scenes', 'camera', 'especially', 'clear', 'one', 'figure', 'boat', 'approaching', 'europeans-', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'also', 'notable', 'Mel', 'released', 'film', 'December', '12', 'feast', 'day', 'Lady', 'Guadalupe', 'Patroness', 'Americas', 'who', 'largely', 'responsible', 'conversion', 'native', 'peoples', 'central', 'southern', 'america', 'film', 'was', 'moderately', 'predictable', 'towards', 'end', 'way', 'reduced', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'film', 'reason', 'love', 'movie', 'positive', 'way', 'mothers', 'self-sacrificing', 'truly', 'loving.Another', 'note', 'dialogue', 'film', 'spoken', 'Mayan', 'dialect', 'thus', 'subtitles', 'are', 'used', 'Even', 'use', 'most', 'unfamiliar', 'language', 'handled', 'well', 'never', 'unfamiliarity', 'distance', 'story', 'use', 'language', 'very', 'believable', 'very', 'easy', 'suspend', 'one', 'disbelief', 'are', 'not', 'fact', 'native', 'speakers', 'probably', 'too', 'violent', 'children', 'brief', 'not', 'graphic', 'nudity', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film']",N/A

Then our brave boys have a little fun with ""organ meat"" before returning to their wives and families in their peaceful, relatively primitive village.  Foreign Mayans from a brutal, relatively advanced urban area arrive on scene, ravage the hut-dwelling tribe, and take a few men prisoner, so that they can have their hearts ripped out, too. (You gotta make a few sacrifices when you live in the big city, you know.)Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is freed from the altar because the sun eclipses, then he and the remaining prisoners--a ""blue-man group"", only without the instruments--are subjected to a game of ""you run to freedom, whilst we throw sharp instruments at you.""  Jaguar Paw manages to get only ""a little impaled""  (only a flesh wound), and the rest of the movie he's gotta run through the jungle in order to escape his pursuers  and rescue his wife and young son from the deep well where he has hidden them.  If he can.There's a lot of pretty scenery--lush greenery, wonderful water falls--but the society is rotting to the core, and thus on the brink of downfall, apocalypse. O.  En route to the city, the captive and captors are met by a young girl with skin lesions.  The Man pushes her repeatedly away with a stick, not wanting to get infected with her sickness-unto-death.  The rejected child staunchly warns them of their future doom by similar illness.  (this kid, a native who only speaks Mayan, is great in this role BTW).  Later, they reject a sick old skeletal dude, on their way to appease the gods.  Well, these presumably serve to foreshadow the deadly illness that will be brought on by the Spaniards whose tall ships come in for a landing in the last scene.Not only do they neglect the ill and slaughter the healthy, but they ravage the land itself in pursuit of their advanced civilization.  Weakened within, their society is rife for conquest from without; thus proving the Will Durant quote at the opening, ""A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within"".Well done!",4,Enjoyable film about the degradation of Mayan civilization before the Spanish arrive.,1184889600,"07 20, 2007",2007,2185,"['Mayan', 'hunters', 'run', 'jungle', 'tapir-dinner', 'animal', 'finally', 'bloody', 'demise', 'trap', 'had', 'set', 'beforehand', 'Then', 'brave', 'boys', 'have', 'little', 'fun', 'organ', 'meat', 'returning', 'wives', 'families', 'peaceful', 'relatively', 'primitive', 'village', 'Foreign', 'Mayans', 'brutal', 'relatively', 'advanced', 'urban', 'area', 'arrive', 'scene', 'ravage', 'hut-dwelling', 'tribe', 'take', 'few', 'men', 'prisoner', 'can', 'have', 'hearts', 'ripped', 'out', 'too', 'got', 'ta', 'make', 'few', 'sacrifices', 'when', 'live', 'big', 'city', 'know', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'Rudy', 'Youngblood', 'freed', 'altar', 'sun', 'eclipses', 'then', 'remaining', 'prisoners', 'blue-man', 'group', 'only', 'instruments', 'are', 'subjected', 'game', 'run', 'freedom', 'throw', 'sharp', 'instruments', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'get', 'only', 'little', 'impaled', 'only', 'flesh', 'wound', 'rest', 'movie', 'got', 'ta', 'run', 'jungle', 'order', 'escape', 'pursuers', 'rescue', 'wife', 'young', 'son', 'deep', 'well', 'where', 'hidden', 'lot', 'pretty', 'scenery', 'lush', 'greenery', 'wonderful', 'water', 'falls', 'society', 'rotting', 'core', 'thus', 'brink', 'downfall', 'apocalypse', 'O', 'En', 'route', 'city', 'captive', 'captors', 'are', 'met', 'young', 'girl', 'skin', 'lesions', 'Man', 'repeatedly', 'away', 'stick', 'not', 'wanting', 'get', 'infected', 'sickness-unto-death', 'rejected', 'child', 'staunchly', 'future', 'doom', 'similar', 'illness', 'kid', 'native', 'who', 'only', 'Mayan', 'great', 'role', 'BTW', 'Later', 'reject', 'sick', 'old', 'skeletal', 'dude', 'way', 'appease', 'gods', 'Well', 'presumably', 'serve', 'foreshadow', 'deadly', 'illness', 'will', 'be', 'brought', 'Spaniards', 'tall', 'ships', 'come', 'landing', 'last', 'scene.Not', 'only', 'do', 'neglect', 'ill', 'slaughter', 'healthy', 'ravage', 'land', 'pursuit', 'advanced', 'civilization', 'Weakened', 'society', 'rife', 'conquest', 'thus', 'proving', 'Will', 'Durant', 'quote', 'opening', 'great', 'civilization', 'not', 'conquered', 'destroyed', '.Well', 'done']",N/A
1005726,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B000GNOKQG,K. Driscoll,"[11, 12]","Mel Gibson is obviously a controversial filmmaker. It is nearly impossible to avoid addressing that here but I'm going to try really hard. Suffice to say, Apocalypto is a very violent and brutal film that portrays the Mayan civilization in a way that troubles some Anthropologists. None of that really matters to most viewers though and I'm here to tell you that most viewers will find that this movie is about as intense and compelling as you can get.Apocalypto is two kinds of action sub-genres mended together in an amazing setting that most viewers will find authentic. It is an action chase film smattered with revenge elements typical of a Gibson movie. Apocalypto opens like Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, with no credits and instead a quotation alluding to the theme of a civilization in decline. The quote is from historian Will Durant and states: ""A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within."" The civilization in this movie is the ancient Mayan civilization and there is a genuine attempt at convincing the audience we are watching from a time machine. Again, like The Passion of the Christ, Gibson refuses to use English and instead goes with Yucatec Mayan, which may or may not be exactly what these people spoke but I have to applaud Gibson for doing this. I can tell you one thing, it hooked me in a lot more than English would have and helped me delve a little deeper and go back in time a little more efficiently than most historical depictions by a long shot. I didn't need my imagination at all. I can't say enough about Gibson's ability to get his audience into the hearts and minds of his characters and their settings. We also get a relatively unknown but talented cast of Native Americans, which itself serves to accentuate the film's authenticity as we have no prior references to the actors' faces.Apocalypto, in perspective, runs as a political parallel and comments on a civilization in decline. However, like most action films, it focuses on one protagonist as we root for his survival and safe resolution to his goals. His name is Jaguar Paw and he is a Mayan man with a young son and a pregnant wife. To avoid spoilers, I'll just say that he ends up having an improbably horrendous few days. He and his friends get a good look at how the Mayan civilization is in decline from greed, disease, self-destruction, failed crops, slavery and of course human sacrifice...you will not forget the human sacrifice. This is hell on Earth but Jaguar Paw is up to the task and I couldn't help but root for him out loud on various occasions as I watched. That alone praises the film's passion. I bought into this movie entirely while watching it and it even prompted me to learn more and study the points of contention many people have with Gibson's depiction. A lot of movies that reference history can get folks thinking and whatever you may find in terms of truth, perhaps it is that provocation alone makes Apocalypto effective.",4,Compelling Chase and Revenge Action,1180396800,"05 29, 2007",2007,3002,"['Mel', 'Gibson', 'obviously', 'controversial', 'filmmaker', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'avoid', 'addressing', 'here', ""'m"", 'going', 'try', 'really', 'hard', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Apocalypto', 'very', 'violent', 'brutal', 'film', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'way', 'Anthropologists', 'None', 'really', 'matters', 'most', 'viewers', ""'m"", 'here', 'tell', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'intense', 'compelling', 'can', 'get.Apocalypto', 'two', 'kinds', 'action', 'sub-genres', 'mended', 'together', 'amazing', 'setting', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'authentic', 'action', 'chase', 'film', 'smattered', 'revenge', 'elements', 'typical', 'Gibson', 'movie', 'Apocalypto', 'Gibson', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'credits', 'instead', 'quotation', 'alluding', 'theme', 'civilization', 'decline', 'quote', 'historian', 'Will', 'Durant', 'states', 'great', 'civilization', 'not', 'conquered', 'destroyed', 'civilization', 'movie', 'ancient', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'genuine', 'attempt', 'convincing', 'audience', 'are', 'watching', 'time', 'machine', 'Again', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'Gibson', 'use', 'English', 'instead', 'Yucatec', 'Mayan', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'exactly', 'what', 'people', 'spoke', 'have', 'applaud', 'Gibson', 'doing', 'can', 'tell', 'one', 'thing', 'hooked', 'lot', 'more', 'English', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'delve', 'little', 'deeper', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'little', 'more', 'efficiently', 'most', 'historical', 'depictions', 'long', 'shot', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'imagination', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'Gibson', 'ability', 'get', 'audience', 'hearts', 'minds', 'characters', 'settings', 'also', 'get', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'talented', 'cast', 'Native', 'Americans', 'accentuate', 'film', 'authenticity', 'have', 'prior', 'references', 'actors', 'faces.Apocalypto', 'perspective', 'political', 'parallel', 'comments', 'civilization', 'decline', 'However', 'most', 'action', 'films', 'one', 'protagonist', 'root', 'survival', 'safe', 'resolution', 'goals', 'name', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'Mayan', 'man', 'young', 'son', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'avoid', 'spoilers', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'up', 'having', 'improbably', 'horrendous', 'few', 'days', 'friends', 'get', 'good', 'look', 'how', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'decline', 'greed', 'disease', 'self-destruction', 'failed', 'crops', 'slavery', 'course', 'human', 'sacrifice', 'will', 'not', 'forget', 'human', 'sacrifice', 'hell', 'Earth', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'up', 'task', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'out', 'loud', 'various', 'occasions', 'watched', 'alone', 'film', 'passion', 'bought', 'movie', 'entirely', 'watching', 'even', 'prompted', 'learn', 'more', 'study', 'points', 'contention', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'Gibson', 'depiction', 'lot', 'movies', 'reference', 'history', 'can', 'get', 'folks', 'thinking', 'may', 'find', 'terms', 'truth', 'perhaps', 'provocation', 'alone', 'Apocalypto', 'effective']",N/A

I'm just reviewing this for anyone looking to see a good film. Mel Gibson is no doubt good at what he does and Apocolypto is very well done also. There will be mixed feelings towards this movie I'm sure as there were towards 'The Passion of the Christ"" but this is a good movie. Apocalypto shows a young mans amazing and heart pounding experience during the decline of the Mayan Civilization. The movie starts with young Jaguar Paw and his father Flint Sky hunting in the jungle with some other men from their tribe. While teasing a fellow tribe-member for the group is startled by something. As the viewer you can barely see what has caught the men off guard because it is hiding so well in the jungle. It turns out to be a large number of people from another village.They do not say much just that they want to cross the village and want no trouble. A man crossing looks deep into Jaguar Paw's eyes and the man passes him a feeling without even saying anything, the feeling was fear. Back at the village Jaguar Paw knew that something was coming and he was right. Early in the morning while the fires still smoking and the people asleep men appear from nowhere. The men attack the village trying not to kill but injuring many. Overtaking this village will not be easy for them as everyone is fighting to protect their families. Who has not been killed is being tied up and taken except for children. After traveling a far distance from their village Jaguar Paw and his people are then taken to a city with a huge temple and from here is where the movie really and I mean really gets exciting. Jaguar Paw must find a way to get back to his village and save his wife and child who he hid in a dry well before it fills up from rain. I don't want to give away anything but lets say that Jaguar Paw makes one of the most courageous and exciting stands ever.I saw Apocalypto and as I was watching all the things most movie previews promise came true in this film. All the ""Heart Pounding"", ""Jaw Dropping"", ""Nonstop Action"", and ""You'll be on the Edge of Your Seat"" promises came true. This movie has such a realistic feel to it as well as these actors. You can feel it all from the fear to the determination and courage of Jaguar Paw. There is no way that you could watch this film and not feel anything. This films action and suspense truly never stops and I mean that literally. The acting is so good that you forget that they're actors and believe that they're really the characters they're portraying.Mel Gibson did an amazing job in making these settings and people look so real. Jaguar Paws story is out of this world, had it been done in some modern day culture, a man trying to retrieve his family would not be this good. Because the elements of Jaguar Paw being very outnumbered it makes a high demand of physical and mental endurance to survive in a jungle and this movie becomes more interesting. He truly has no weapons except the jungle he grew up in and knows like the back of his hand but still exhaustion and time are not on his side. His journey becomes all the more impossible and this makes the movie that more intriguing cause you want him to succeed. This film is definitely not for the squeamish type, there's nothing in it you wouldn't find in most scary flicks today but it is still very violent. Apocalypto is an amazing movie that I would recommend to many but be ready to sit on the edge of your seat cause you'll be there for most of the film.",5,This Defines Nonstop Action,1182902400,"06 27, 2007",2007,3559,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'off', 'saying', ""'ll"", 'find', 'nothing', 'historic', 'accuracy', 'review', ""'m"", 'just', 'reviewing', 'anyone', 'looking', 'see', 'good', 'film', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'doubt', 'good', 'what', 'Apocolypto', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'also', 'will', 'be', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', 'towards', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'good', 'movie', 'Apocalypto', 'young', 'mans', 'amazing', 'heart', 'pounding', 'experience', 'decline', 'Mayan', 'Civilization', 'movie', 'young', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'father', 'Flint', 'Sky', 'hunting', 'jungle', 'other', 'men', 'tribe', 'teasing', 'fellow', 'tribe-member', 'group', 'startled', 'something', 'viewer', 'can', 'barely', 'see', 'what', 'caught', 'men', 'off', 'guard', 'hiding', 'so', 'well', 'jungle', 'out', 'be', 'large', 'number', 'people', 'village.They', 'do', 'not', 'say', 'much', 'just', 'want', 'cross', 'village', 'want', 'trouble', 'man', 'crossing', 'deep', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'eyes', 'man', 'feeling', 'even', 'saying', 'anything', 'feeling', 'was', 'fear', 'village', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'knew', 'something', 'was', 'coming', 'was', 'right', 'Early', 'morning', 'fires', 'still', 'smoking', 'people', 'asleep', 'men', 'appear', 'nowhere', 'men', 'attack', 'village', 'trying', 'not', 'kill', 'injuring', 'many', 'Overtaking', 'village', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'easy', 'everyone', 'fighting', 'protect', 'families', 'Who', 'not', 'been', 'killed', 'being', 'tied', 'up', 'taken', 'children', 'traveling', 'far', 'distance', 'village', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'people', 'are', 'then', 'taken', 'city', 'huge', 'temple', 'here', 'where', 'movie', 'really', 'mean', 'really', 'exciting', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'back', 'village', 'save', 'wife', 'child', 'who', 'dry', 'well', 'up', 'rain', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'anything', 'lets', 'say', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'one', 'most', 'courageous', 'exciting', 'stands', 'ever.I', 'saw', 'Apocalypto', 'was', 'watching', 'things', 'most', 'movie', 'previews', 'promise', 'came', 'true', 'film', 'Heart', 'Pounding', 'Jaw', 'Dropping', 'Nonstop', 'Action', ""'ll"", 'be', 'Edge', 'Your', 'Seat', 'came', 'true', 'movie', 'realistic', 'feel', 'as', 'well', 'actors', 'can', 'feel', 'fear', 'determination', 'courage', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'way', 'could', 'watch', 'film', 'not', 'feel', 'anything', 'films', 'action', 'suspense', 'truly', 'never', 'mean', 'literally', 'acting', 'so', 'good', 'forget', ""'re"", 'actors', 'believe', ""'re"", 'really', 'characters', ""'re"", 'portraying.Mel', 'Gibson', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'making', 'settings', 'people', 'look', 'so', 'real', 'Jaguar', 'Paws', 'story', 'world', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'modern', 'day', 'culture', 'man', 'trying', 'retrieve', 'family', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'elements', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'being', 'very', 'outnumbered', 'high', 'demand', 'physical', 'mental', 'endurance', 'survive', 'jungle', 'movie', 'more', 'interesting', 'truly', 'weapons', 'jungle', 'grew', 'up', 'knows', 'back', 'hand', 'still', 'exhaustion', 'time', 'are', 'not', 'side', 'journey', 'more', 'impossible', 'movie', 'more', 'intriguing', 'cause', 'want', 'succeed', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'squeamish', 'type', 'nothing', 'would', ""n't"", 'find', 'most', 'scary', 'flicks', 'today', 'still', 'very', 'violent', 'Apocalypto', 'amazing', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'many', 'be', 'ready', 'sit', 'edge', 'seat', 'cause', ""'ll"", 'be', 'there', 'most', 'film']",N/A

With ""The Passion of the Christ,"" Gibson proved that a film can be great even if the audience has to rely on subtitles to get them through the film.  In ""Apocalypto,"" Gibson proves it once more.  Although this is a stretch, I'd have to say that Gibson's story here is much like that of William Shakespeare's plays in that you do not have to understand the language in order to understand the story.  The story is told through the eyes, actions, and emotions of each character.  In ""Apocalypto,"" we are introduced to Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and his close-knit tribal family.  The story begins with tribal members hunting tapir.  We are introduced to Jaguar Paw's brother, Blunted, and his father.  Though few of the characters are named, we learn quickly who they are and have a relationship with each of them.  Warriors from another, more powerful tribe, attack the village, take prisoners, and abandoned the children.  Jaguar Paw hides his pregnant wife and son in an empty well and vows to return for them.  From there, the story moves to the giant Mexican pyramids and the blood-encrusted culture that base their lives around it.  We see slavery, political and religious manipulation and flat-out cruelty.At this point, the story enters its second phase, where a great chase ensues as a prophecy unravels before the Mayan people's eyes.  We are also given a potential clue as to why this complicated and advanced society suddenly vanished.Perhaps it's not as historically accurate as others would want, but when you boil it down to the basics, ""Apocalypto"" is two separate stories combined into one.  On one hand you have a tale of a family whose love for one another keeps them going.  On the other hand you have a great chase tale that will hold you in your seat for the entire running time of the film.Gibson has done a masterful job with this film.  He's taken core characters with minimal dialogue and created great heroes and villains with them.  The actors and actresses in this film perfectly exude their respective intentions flawlessly.  You immediately pick up on who's the strong-hearted warrior, who's the honorable and loyal father, who's the sinister, cruel underling, and who's the primary villain.Well done flick that deserves repeat viewings.

1005734,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000GNOKQG,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[310, 338]","Even with all the controversy surrounding Mel Gibson last year (and doesn't it seem as if each new week brings another celebrity meltdown?), I still looked forward to seeing ""Apocalypto.""  Why?  If for no other reason--the subject matter, subtitles, and lack of star power made it a bold choice for a major studio release.  Films of this nature generally go into limited distribution to develop an audience and critical word of mouth before expanding, if they ever do.  But with Gibson at the helm, ""Apocalypto"" debuted with much fanfare and backing just in time to be considered for 2006's Academy Awards.  For some reason, though, I still missed ""Apocalypto"" at the theaters.  I have heard every description imaginable from those that have seen the film--from the ""best movie ever"" to ""excessively violent and disturbing.""  And while I wouldn't go to either of those extremes, ""Apocalypto"" is certainly an accomplished adventure picture.Set in ancient Mayan times, ""Apocalypto"" is essentially the harrowing journey of one man, a youth named Jaguar Paw (a convincing Rudy Youngblood).  Living a simple and isolated existence, his tribe are very at home within the forest.  One day, the unthinkable happens.  They are attacked by another group with apparent intentions of enslaving whomever they don't kill.  Youngblood's wife and son are stranded in an underground well, many others are murdered, and Youngblood is among a dozen or so who are rounded up and marched out in bondage.  The subsequent journey leads to a fantastical temple sequence, where it becomes clear that the prisoners are not to become slaves--but sacrifices.  The remainder of the film deals with how Youngblood can escape this situation.  The temple scenes feature a cast of thousands, ritualistic and brutal slayings, and a mob mania that is terrifying and believable.  Racing against the clock to save his wife, Youngblood must escape back through the jungle--where all he has to help him are his cunning and an almost spiritual connection to his surroundings.  The action is practically nonstop, it's inventive, and it is beautifully staged.  Much of ""Apocalypto,"" therefore, is absolutely riveting and wildly entertaining.For the purists who will debate the film's historical accuracy, I will neither deny or confirm the legitimacy of the events that transpire within ""Apocalypto.""  While there do seem to be some liberties taken with the historical timeline (as evidenced by a surprise in the ending--which I enjoyed despite its implausibility), I really don't think that this film aspires to be a ""historical document.""  Gibson has made an adventure story using a Mayan backdrop.  The feel and look of his picture stay as valid as possible to the timeframe, however, I never interpreted this picture as a ""true"" story.  Guess what?  Fictional liberties are taken in every motion picture.  Otherwise every motion picture would be a documentary--and even documentaries have an angle or slant which make them less than ""true"" in many cases.  ""Apocalypto,"" at heart, is an effective action picture that makes interesting use of its Mayan setting.I guess ""Apocalypto"" is not for the squeamish--however, the violence depicted is by no means unusual by modern film standards.  You can see much worse in today's ""torture"" cinema, those films that pass for horror with current audiences.  I suppose what makes ""Apocalypto"" more vivid is that the violence is in a believable context.  There are some beheadings and some hunting scenes, but the brutality is intrinsic to the story ""Apocalypto"" is telling.  I don't believe serious minded filmgoers will be put off by seeing some savagery depicted in a film about ancient Mayan cultures--it's not as if this is a Merchant/Ivory production with tea parties and witty banter.I do recommend ""Apocalypto.""  Beautifully filmed, the technical merits of the film are beyond reproach.  The cinematography, score, and editing all enhance this exciting tale.  I imagine these elements really shone bright for those who saw this on the big screen. A great action picture that is for adults--check it out.

That's a pity,for while there are indeed a number of excellent films to choose from this holiday season, few of them are as good as this one.  Yes, it is violent--extremely violent.  But this is not the visceral near-pornography of a bad horror movie--the violence of APOCALYPTO serves a vision of cinematic artistry, and if certain scenes are not easy to watch, the film as a whole remains impossible to turn away from.Set in the ancient Mayan Empire on the brink of discovery by the white man, APOCALYPTO is the story of Jaguar Paw, a young hunter of the forest who is loving husband, father, and son.  He and his family and friends live peacefully in the depths of a great forest until the tranquility of their sheltered existence is pitilessly wiped out by a band of brutal marauders led by the bestial Zero Wolf.  Taken into captivity and brought to the city to be sacrificed to the Mayan gods, Jaguar Paw escapes into the dark jungle, determined to return to his wife and son and make a new beginning for themselves.  It is, like Joseph Conrad's immortal novella, a quest into the very heart of darkness, and Jaguar Paw and his world will never be the same again.Taut, engrossing, and incredibly thrilling, APOCALYPTO delivers on many levels.  As an action movie alone it is a success, but that ignores the thoughtfulness and care that has gone into the script and direction.  This is one of those stories that can perhaps be interpreted in many equally valid terms, and the parallels between the Babylonesque Mayan culture and our own are indeed frightening.  Gibson deserves much praise for his artistic vision--something few contemporary directors seem to have--but it would be a crime not to likewise praise his cast.  Rudy Youngblood is exceptional and empathetic as the benighted Jaguar Paw, and Dalia Hernandez is just as good as his young wife, whose own subplot of self-discovery, courage and faith is a vital element of the broader story.  Raoul Trujillo's Zero Wolf is one of the great villains of movie history, and to put it mildly you have to love to hate him.  The supporting players are well-rounded and handle their various roles believably and uniformly well--the cast as a whole may be unknown, but unknown or not, they're very good.Thriller, drama, social commentary--all these things and more, APOCALYPTO is a tribute to the power of story and its power to capture the essence of reality.  Certainly not for everyone, APOCALYPTO is at times painful to watch, and children definitely do not need to be exposed to it.  Even so, APOCALYPTO is a grand achievement, and impossible not to recommend to discerning adults.",5,A CONTEMPORARY CLASSIC,1166659200,"12 21, 2006",2006,2818,"['Mel', 'Gibson', 'APOCALYPTO', 'up', 'hype', 'Long', 'anticipated', 'frequently', 'dismissed', 'Gibson', 'Folly', 'movie', 'opened', '1', 'ticket', 'receipts', 'quickly', 'plummeted', 'pity', 'are', 'indeed', 'number', 'excellent', 'films', 'choose', 'holiday', 'season', 'few', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'Yes', 'violent', 'extremely', 'violent', 'not', 'visceral', 'near-pornography', 'bad', 'horror', 'movie', 'violence', 'APOCALYPTO', 'vision', 'cinematic', 'artistry', 'certain', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'easy', 'watch', 'film', 'whole', 'impossible', 'turn', 'away', 'from.Set', 'ancient', 'Mayan', 'Empire', 'brink', 'discovery', 'white', 'man', 'APOCALYPTO', 'story', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'young', 'hunter', 'forest', 'who', 'loving', 'husband', 'father', 'son', 'family', 'friends', 'live', 'peacefully', 'depths', 'great', 'forest', 'tranquility', 'sheltered', 'existence', 'pitilessly', 'wiped', 'out', 'band', 'brutal', 'marauders', 'led', 'bestial', 'Zero', 'Wolf', 'Taken', 'captivity', 'brought', 'city', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'Mayan', 'gods', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'dark', 'jungle', 'determined', 'return', 'wife', 'son', 'make', 'new', 'beginning', 'Joseph', 'Conrad', 'immortal', 'novella', 'quest', 'very', 'heart', 'darkness', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'world', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'again.Taut', 'engrossing', 'incredibly', 'thrilling', 'APOCALYPTO', 'delivers', 'many', 'levels', 'action', 'movie', 'success', 'thoughtfulness', 'care', 'gone', 'script', 'direction', 'one', 'stories', 'can', 'perhaps', 'be', 'interpreted', 'many', 'equally', 'valid', 'terms', 'parallels', 'Babylonesque', 'Mayan', 'culture', 'own', 'are', 'indeed', 'frightening', 'Gibson', 'much', 'praise', 'artistic', 'vision', 'something', 'few', 'contemporary', 'directors', 'seem', 'have', 'would', 'be', 'crime', 'not', 'likewise', 'praise', 'cast', 'Rudy', 'Youngblood', 'exceptional', 'empathetic', 'benighted', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'Dalia', 'Hernandez', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'young', 'wife', 'own', 'subplot', 'self-discovery', 'courage', 'faith', 'vital', 'element', 'broader', 'story', 'Raoul', 'Trujillo', 'Zero', 'Wolf', 'one', 'great', 'villains', 'movie', 'history', 'put', 'mildly', 'have', 'love', 'hate', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'well-rounded', 'handle', 'various', 'roles', 'believably', 'uniformly', 'well', 'cast', 'whole', 'may', 'be', 'unknown', 'unknown', 'not', ""'re"", 'very', 'good.Thriller', 'drama', 'social', 'commentary', 'things', 'more', 'APOCALYPTO', 'tribute', 'power', 'story', 'power', 'capture', 'essence', 'reality', 'Certainly', 'not', 'everyone', 'APOCALYPTO', 'times', 'painful', 'watch', 'children', 'definitely', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'exposed', 'Even', 'so', 'APOCALYPTO', 'grand', 'achievement', 'impossible', 'not', 'recommend', 'discerning', 'adults']",N/A
1005738,A2W6SI073FIRMA,B000GNOKQG,KlownArt,"[1, 1]","ApocalyptoBefore I start this review I'd like to say that I am not a history major. I am not going to analyze this film for its inaccuracies like many other reviewers. I am just going to review this movie for what it is...a movie.Mel Gibson is at it yet again. With the success of theThe Passion of the Christ, Mel can pretty much do anything he wants now. This movie takes place in the early 1500s when Mayans were still a dominant force. The Mayans would conquer villages and tear down miles of forestry just in build their cities. They would sacrifice lives just to increase their empire. Speaking of sacrifice, you will see a ton of that in this movie. The Mayans worshipped Gods that were appeased by sacrifice.When I first watched through this movie I was a little disappointed. I had heard so many great things about it and felt that the movie was lacking. I was considering giving it three stars. Then I watched it with Alternate Commentary by Mel Gibson and Farhad Safinia as well as the Making of extra. These changed the way I thought about the movie. If anyone feels let down by the movie, these extras will help you much better understand the movie and appreciate it.Your main character is Jaguar Paw. He is a part of a small village of hunters. The movie starts of with a very humorous sequence that shows Jaguar and a few others playing a joke on another tribesman. This truly established that these were fun loving, normal people. I'm glad they introduced the film this way. Soon after their village is attacked by the Mayans. Some of them are killed, but most are taken as slaves. Jaguar luckily lowered his pregnant wife and child into a pit to hide before he was captured.After that point you will see them walk all the way to the Mayan capital. This is fairly long and has its moments, but I felt it was fairly boring. When they get to the place a sacrifice is where things really start to pick up. Jaguar doesn't get sacrificed, but instead is used as Target Practice by the Mayan soldiers. Suddenly, he escapes, but not with out killing the chief's son first. This sets up a huge chase scene with a ton of great moments. Jaguar must get his wife and child out of the pit before they drown from the rain filling it up. The ending to the movie is a surprise and if you know your history is very interesting.My problem with the film is that the gore is not what I expected it to me. Most of it is good, but part where they are tearing organs just looks unrealistic. Mel Gibson tried so hard to make sure that the 800-member cast looked perfect, but added in people ripping out organs that took me out of the film. Also, Jaguar Paw is one of the most uninteresting characters in the movie and he is your main character. He garners no emotion at all.Overall I would say that this is a pretty good movie. Some people my find it difficult to read subtitles constantly, due to the movie being in the Mayan language, but it's not that bad. Also, I'm really happy that they gave us subtitles for the alternate commentary. My girlfriend is partially deaf, so it is very helpful for us.",4,Better once you watch the extra commentary,1214956800,"07 2, 2008",2008,3096,"['ApocalyptoBefore', 'start', 'review', ""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'history', 'major', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'analyze', 'film', 'inaccuracies', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'am', 'just', 'going', 'review', 'movie', 'what', 'movie.Mel', 'Gibson', 'yet', 'again', 'success', 'theThe', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'Mel', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'do', 'anything', 'now', 'movie', 'place', 'early', '1500s', 'when', 'Mayans', 'were', 'still', 'dominant', 'force', 'Mayans', 'would', 'conquer', 'villages', 'tear', 'down', 'miles', 'forestry', 'just', 'build', 'cities', 'would', 'sacrifice', 'lives', 'just', 'increase', 'empire', 'Speaking', 'sacrifice', 'will', 'see', 'ton', 'movie', 'Mayans', 'worshipped', 'Gods', 'were', 'appeased', 'sacrifice.When', 'first', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'had', 'heard', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'things', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'lacking', 'was', 'considering', 'giving', 'three', 'stars', 'Then', 'watched', 'Alternate', 'Commentary', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Farhad', 'Safinia', 'as', 'well', 'Making', 'extra', 'changed', 'way', 'thought', 'movie', 'anyone', 'feels', 'let', 'down', 'movie', 'extras', 'will', 'help', 'much', 'better', 'understand', 'movie', 'appreciate', 'it.Your', 'main', 'character', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'part', 'small', 'village', 'hunters', 'movie', 'very', 'humorous', 'sequence', 'Jaguar', 'few', 'others', 'playing', 'joke', 'tribesman', 'truly', 'established', 'were', 'fun', 'loving', 'normal', 'people', ""'m"", 'glad', 'introduced', 'film', 'way', 'Soon', 'village', 'attacked', 'Mayans', 'are', 'killed', 'most', 'are', 'taken', 'slaves', 'Jaguar', 'luckily', 'lowered', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'child', 'pit', 'hide', 'was', 'captured.After', 'point', 'will', 'see', 'walk', 'way', 'Mayan', 'capital', 'fairly', 'long', 'moments', 'felt', 'was', 'fairly', 'boring', 'When', 'get', 'place', 'sacrifice', 'where', 'things', 'really', 'start', 'pick', 'up', 'Jaguar', ""n't"", 'get', 'sacrificed', 'instead', 'used', 'Target', 'Practice', 'Mayan', 'soldiers', 'Suddenly', 'not', 'out', 'killing', 'chief', 'son', 'first', 'up', 'huge', 'chase', 'scene', 'ton', 'great', 'moments', 'Jaguar', 'must', 'get', 'wife', 'child', 'pit', 'drown', 'rain', 'filling', 'up', 'ending', 'movie', 'surprise', 'know', 'history', 'very', 'interesting.My', 'problem', 'film', 'gore', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'Most', 'good', 'part', 'where', 'are', 'tearing', 'organs', 'just', 'unrealistic', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'make', 'sure', '800-member', 'cast', 'looked', 'perfect', 'added', 'people', 'ripping', 'out', 'organs', 'took', 'film', 'Also', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'one', 'most', 'uninteresting', 'characters', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'emotion', 'all.Overall', 'would', 'say', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'people', 'find', 'difficult', 'read', 'subtitles', 'constantly', 'due', 'movie', 'being', 'Mayan', 'language', 'not', 'bad', 'Also', ""'m"", 'really', 'happy', 'gave', 'subtitles', 'alternate', 'commentary', 'girlfriend', 'partially', 'deaf', 'very', 'helpful']",N/A

1005740,A329ALHKYK62O7,B000GNOKQG,Ky. Col.,"[1, 1]","Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" is the tale of a protagonist (Jaguar Paw) caught up in the epic and often tragic tale of civilization.  It is a story of courage, love, cruelty, and honor.  The film is set in sixteenth century Mexico.  The Mayan civilization is centuries past its heyday and on the verge of its destruction.The protagonist is living in a peaceful native village with generally likeable inhabitants.  Things change quickly in a fairly disturbing scene where Mayan warriors slaughter or enslave most of the inhabitants.  What fallows is a journey to a still grand but declining Mayan city and a lone journey to save his family.  The Mayan civilization seems so foreign and yet so familiar to the modern world.Although shot in an ancient language, the subtitles and story are easy to follow.  The film has many memorable and haunting scenes including the attack on the village, the diseased girl predicting the fall of the Mayas, and the protagonist stumbling into a field of bodies reminisent of a Khmer Rouge killing field.  The chase sequence is well executed with such dangers as pursuing warriors, waterfalls, quicksand, and Jaguars.  The scene on the rainy beach toward the end was effectively shot.  Due to graphic violence and some nudity, this is not a movie for children.Overall, a beautifully filmed and at times disturbing image of the individual and civilization as a whole.",4,End of an Era,1196035200,"11 26, 2007",2007,1394,"['Mel', 'Gibson', 'Apocalypto', 'tale', 'protagonist', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'caught', 'up', 'epic', 'often', 'tragic', 'tale', 'civilization', 'story', 'courage', 'love', 'cruelty', 'honor', 'film', 'set', 'sixteenth', 'century', 'Mexico', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'centuries', 'heyday', 'verge', 'destruction.The', 'protagonist', 'living', 'peaceful', 'native', 'village', 'generally', 'likeable', 'inhabitants', 'Things', 'change', 'quickly', 'fairly', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'where', 'Mayan', 'warriors', 'slaughter', 'enslave', 'most', 'inhabitants', 'What', 'journey', 'still', 'grand', 'declining', 'Mayan', 'city', 'lone', 'journey', 'save', 'family', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'so', 'foreign', 'yet', 'so', 'familiar', 'modern', 'world.Although', 'shot', 'ancient', 'language', 'subtitles', 'story', 'are', 'easy', 'follow', 'film', 'many', 'memorable', 'haunting', 'scenes', 'including', 'attack', 'village', 'diseased', 'girl', 'predicting', 'fall', 'Mayas', 'protagonist', 'stumbling', 'field', 'bodies', 'reminisent', 'Khmer', 'Rouge', 'killing', 'field', 'chase', 'sequence', 'well', 'executed', 'such', 'dangers', 'pursuing', 'warriors', 'waterfalls', 'quicksand', 'Jaguars', 'scene', 'rainy', 'beach', 'end', 'was', 'effectively', 'shot', 'Due', 'graphic', 'violence', 'nudity', 'not', 'movie', 'children.Overall', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'times', 'disturbing', 'image', 'individual', 'civilization', 'whole']",N/A

The Mayan high priest obviously knew something about eclipses, because he correctly predicted the sun god would re-emerge.  Anyone who has read National Geographic knows the Mayans were among the best astronomers, and their calendars were so precise they do not repeat for thousands of years (our Gregorian calendar repeats in six, if I'm not mistaken).Too bad the film's writers didn't have as much expertise.  With the sacrifice aborted, Jaguar Paw and Blunted were condemned to be dispatched out of sight of the public.  Jaguar Paw escapes into the forest, and during the night, there it was, a screamingly bright, large full moon.  The only problem; full moons and solar eclipses don't go together.  Solar eclipses occur when the moon is between the earth and the sun, therefore, the chances of a full moon the night after a solar eclipse are, zero.I also have a problem with the way the pursuing Indians pluck their arrows out of trees on the run, after they've missed Jaguar Paw.  I don't know if stone arrows can withstand that abuse.  You can probably shoot a flint arrow into a tree, but to yank it sideways while on a dead run would probably shatter the arrowhead.Otherwise, the film is OK.  It shows the Mayans in decline, and the barbarity they display is in proportion with that decline, which is pretty much what happened with other great civilizations (most famously, Rome).",3,"Let down by faulty astronomy, in my opinion",1209772800,"05 3, 2008",2008,1494,"['When', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'lead', 'character', 'was', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'was', 'saved', 'total', 'solar', 'eclipse', 'Mayan', 'high', 'priest', 'obviously', 'knew', 'something', 'eclipses', 'correctly', 'predicted', 'sun', 'god', 'would', 're-emerge', 'Anyone', 'who', 'read', 'National', 'Geographic', 'Mayans', 'were', 'best', 'astronomers', 'calendars', 'were', 'so', 'precise', 'do', 'not', 'repeat', 'thousands', 'years', 'Gregorian', 'calendar', 'repeats', 'six', ""'m"", 'not', 'mistaken', '.Too', 'bad', 'film', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'expertise', 'sacrifice', 'aborted', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'Blunted', 'were', 'condemned', 'be', 'dispatched', 'sight', 'public', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'forest', 'night', 'was', 'screamingly', 'bright', 'large', 'full', 'moon', 'only', 'problem', 'full', 'moons', 'solar', 'eclipses', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'together', 'Solar', 'eclipses', 'occur', 'when', 'moon', 'earth', 'sun', 'therefore', 'chances', 'full', 'moon', 'night', 'solar', 'eclipse', 'are', 'zero.I', 'also', 'have', 'problem', 'way', 'pursuing', 'Indians', 'pluck', 'arrows', 'trees', 'run', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'stone', 'arrows', 'can', 'withstand', 'abuse', 'can', 'probably', 'shoot', 'flint', 'arrow', 'tree', 'yank', 'dead', 'run', 'would', 'probably', 'shatter', 'arrowhead.Otherwise', 'film', 'OK', 'Mayans', 'decline', 'barbarity', 'display', 'proportion', 'decline', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'happened', 'other', 'great', 'civilizations', 'most', 'famously', 'Rome']",N/A

1005743,A2VMVTDYQDA6L8,B000GNOKQG,Laura Knight-Jadczyk,"[0, 0]","I had my doubts about seeing this movie because I had heard it was so bloody and violent, but after watching it, I am glad I did. Many other reviewers have described the movie, so I won't bore you with that, I'll just offer some general impressions.The opening scenes are designed, I think, to engage the sympathy of the viewer for the forest tribe.  While it might be difficult for many people to feel sympathy for pre-Colombian natives who are violent and even savage, I think Gibson did a good job on this part.  We accompany the men on a hunt, see that they engage in typical ""male bonding"" behavior, see that they have mother-in-law problems, love and cherish their children, and so on.More than that, during the hunting scene, we see something else: a warning given that was ignored, shoved under the rug. Had that warning of fear been heeded, preparations made to resist the impending terror, there might have been less destruction.  That's a good object lesson for us even today.The scenes of the Mayan city were especially helpful to me.  I have been to Mexico and have studied Mayan ruins first hand.  They left me feeling very disturbed; I could NOT imagine what kind of culture would create such savage and even ugly art.  I don't mean ugly in the sense that it was badly done, not that at all.  But the ""soul"" revealed in Mayan art is truly horrifying.Mel Gibson gave this art a background for me that finally helped me to make sense of it.I noticed something else: all the savagery, body pierciings, horrible and ugly hairdos of the women, and the general behavior of the culture reminded me of U.S. society over the past 10 years or so.  I know that seems a bit over-the-top, but I have never been able to understand why attractive people would go so far out of their way to make themselves ugly with hair that looks like its been cut with a dull lawnmower, body piercings, wearing clothes that look like slave gear or rejects from a concentration camp, and so on.  It's just bizarre.  (And I won't even go into what passes as art these days, much less music!)When you take those things in the context of what has happened to the U.S. since 9-11, and you compare it to the society depicted in this movie, there are unnerving parallels.  I even think that Gibson intended the movie to reflect the U.S. in it's decline.  At the beginning of the movie, he quotes Ariel Durant who wrote:""A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within.""As the movie came to the end, I was glad that Gibson didn't use it as a cheesy add for his religious agenda...It was beautifully photographed, with fantastic sets and I have to say that the violence was not gratuitous: that's just how things were then and to have made the movie otherwise would have been cheating.Well worth watching; I'm glad I did.",5,Well Worth Watching,1196294400,"11 29, 2007",2007,2843,"['had', 'doubts', 'seeing', 'movie', 'had', 'heard', 'was', 'so', 'bloody', 'violent', 'watching', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'Many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'described', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bore', ""'ll"", 'just', 'offer', 'general', 'impressions.The', 'opening', 'scenes', 'are', 'designed', 'think', 'engage', 'sympathy', 'viewer', 'forest', 'tribe', 'might', 'be', 'difficult', 'many', 'people', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'pre-Colombian', 'natives', 'who', 'are', 'violent', 'even', 'savage', 'think', 'Gibson', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'part', 'accompany', 'men', 'hunt', 'see', 'engage', 'typical', 'male', 'bonding', 'behavior', 'see', 'have', 'mother-in-law', 'problems', 'love', 'cherish', 'children', 'so', 'on.More', 'hunting', 'scene', 'see', 'something', 'else', 'warning', 'given', 'was', 'ignored', 'shoved', 'rug', 'Had', 'warning', 'fear', 'been', 'heeded', 'preparations', 'made', 'resist', 'impending', 'terror', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'destruction', 'good', 'object', 'lesson', 'even', 'today.The', 'scenes', 'Mayan', 'city', 'were', 'especially', 'helpful', 'have', 'been', 'Mexico', 'have', 'studied', 'Mayan', 'ruins', 'first', 'hand', 'left', 'feeling', 'very', 'disturbed', 'could', 'NOT', 'imagine', 'what', 'kind', 'culture', 'would', 'create', 'such', 'savage', 'even', 'ugly', 'art', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ugly', 'sense', 'was', 'badly', 'done', 'not', 'soul', 'revealed', 'Mayan', 'art', 'truly', 'horrifying.Mel', 'Gibson', 'gave', 'art', 'background', 'finally', 'helped', 'make', 'sense', 'it.I', 'noticed', 'something', 'else', 'savagery', 'body', 'pierciings', 'horrible', 'ugly', 'hairdos', 'women', 'general', 'behavior', 'culture', 'reminded', 'U.S.', 'society', 'past', '10', 'years', 'so', 'know', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'understand', 'why', 'attractive', 'people', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'way', 'make', 'ugly', 'hair', 'been', 'cut', 'dull', 'lawnmower', 'body', 'piercings', 'wearing', 'clothes', 'look', 'slave', 'gear', 'rejects', 'concentration', 'camp', 'so', 'just', 'bizarre', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'go', 'what', 'art', 'days', 'much', 'less', 'music', 'When', 'take', 'things', 'context', 'what', 'happened', 'U.S.', '9-11', 'compare', 'society', 'depicted', 'movie', 'are', 'unnerving', 'parallels', 'even', 'think', 'Gibson', 'intended', 'movie', 'reflect', 'U.S.', 'decline', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Ariel', 'Durant', 'who', 'wrote', 'great', 'civilization', 'not', 'conquered', 'destroyed', 'movie', 'came', 'end', 'was', 'glad', 'Gibson', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'cheesy', 'add', 'religious', 'agenda', 'was', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'fantastic', 'sets', 'have', 'say', 'violence', 'was', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'just', 'how', 'things', 'were', 'then', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cheating.Well', 'worth', 'watching', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did']",N/A
1005744,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000GNOKQG,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 8]","""Mel Gibson's Apocalypto"" opens with a quotation from the philosopher-historian Will Durant: ""A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within.""  This is a great quote, but extremely problematic for the movie that follows.  The campaign by the Spanish conquistadors against the Maya states began in the early 16th century and ended at the end of the 17th century when the last Maya stronghold, the Itza capital of Tayasal on Lake Pet&eacute;n Itz&aacute;, fell.  The Maya were organized into a number of independent states that had to be conquered one by one, in contrast to the Spanish campaigns against the Aztec and Inca nations where overthrowing a single political center proved to be the key to conquest.  Durant's quote talks about corruption within being followed by external conquest, what we usually associate with the decadence that preceded the fall of Rome, but that does not apply to what happened to the Maya.  Besides, even those Mesoamerican cultures that did not engage in human sacrifice were going to be immune to the myriad diseases that Europeans brought to the Americas and which decimates entire peoples.By the time this movie came out in 2006 the fact it was entitled ""Mel Gibson's Apocalypto"" hurt rather than helped it at the box office.  On July 28, 2006, Gibson was arrested in California for speeding and on suspicion of drunk driving.  During his arrest Gibson made a series of anti-Semitic remarks, and since his previous film, ""The Passion of the Christ,"" was criticized for alleged anti-Semitic elements, this was potentially a major nail in the coffin for Gibson.  ""Apocalypto"" cost $40 million to make and took in just short of $51 million in the U.S., which would make it a major disappointment.  But beyond the bad publicity for the man who co-wrote (with Farhad Safinia), directed and produced the film there was the additional hurdle that all of the dialogue is spoken in the Yucatec Maya language, which is still spoken today.  The fact that there are subtitles involved will remind many viewers of Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ,"" as will the depictions of violence (to a lesser degree).  Just let me say that I ended up watching this DVD by myself because nobody else wanted to ""read"" the movie.  This is too bad, because the film is a visual delight.""Apocalypto"" is set in Mesoamerica on the eve of the arrival of the Spanish, presumably on the Yucatan peninsula.  After a tapir hunt, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and the group of young hunters led by his father Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead) encounter a group of refugees who seek permission to pass through the forest.  More important than the Durant quote is the story told that night by the village elder of how human beings always want more, despite having the best gifts from each of the animals of the forest.  The fable comes to life when a party of Maya raiders, led by Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo), attacks the village.  Jaguar Paw is able to lower his pregnant wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez) and his young son by a vine into a small ground cave before he is captured by the vicious Middle Eye (Gerardo Tarcena).  While the captives are taken to a Maya City, Jaguar Paw worries about his wife and child, trapped in the cave and unable to escape..Actually, for most of the last act of this film you will not be doing a lot of reading, because ""Apocalypto"" turns out to be, in the end at least, a chase movie.  ""Death Proof"" was suppose to be a big time chase movie, but I have to tell you ""Apocalypto"" is a whole lot better in that regard.  The movie I was reminded most of us ended up being ""The Last of the Mohicans,"" not just because most of the action takes place in a lush green forest, but also because most of the memorable moments in both films have to do with people look at each other.  It has been a long time since I have seen somebody bore holes through people with their eyes the way Zero Wolf does in this movie.  Actually, there is another point of comparison between the two movies in that Jaguar Paw runs even more than Nathaniel ever did.  I want to add that my favorite performance in the film was by Morris Birdyellowhead: in his final scene as Flint Sky, I was no longer aware that he was acting, so thoroughly had he become his character for me.The title does not have anything to do with the related term apocalypse, despite the obvious implications, because ""Apocalypto"" is a Greek term that translates as ""new beginning.""  The significance here is more ironic than anything else, because the story really is about an ending more than any beginning that takes place after the final credits.  ""Apocalypto"" was nominated for Oscars for Makeup, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing, and certainly the makeup and costumes we see in the Maya city are absolutely spectacular.  However, while the depiction of Maya culture, architecture and dress is visually impressive, it has been criticized by scholars as being unauthentic and superficial.  Apparently the film takes bits and pieces from various people and time periods to create this picture of the Maya.  Fortunately I never take what I see in movies as gospel when it comes to history and culture, and I would encourage you to check out what you can find online about the Maya once this film sparks your interest.  I have already learned a lot on the subject.",5,"Enjoy this gorgeous ""chase film,"" but do not take it for Maya history",1180742400,"06 2, 2007",2007,5381,"['Mel', 'Gibson', 'Apocalypto',

1005747,A12OTDIWIG841L,B000GNOKQG,Leslie Thompson,"[0, 0]","I was totally blown away by this film's lush setting, tragic characters, and vividly bloody scenes.My favorite character was the man assumed to be infertile. I felt sorry for him as the others made fun of him, as his mother-in-law repeatedly told him that he was worthless. And then later on, his separation with his mother-in-law was so touching. I found it intriguing that their society blamed the man for infertility - in most cases, it seems, the woman is blamed if she ""fails"" to produce a child.But anyway, to me, the strongest part of the movie was as Jaguar Paw, about to be sacrificed atop the temple, was spared. The obese, ""upper class"" young boy who giggled and pulled at his mother's dress in impatience perfectly depicted how torture is entertainment for the entitled (although the masses obviously enjoyed it as well). And I'm not ashamed to admit that I liked seeing all the violence as much as any of the masses. The violence here was so shocking, so striking, and the images stay with you for awhile. But who would go to see a movie like this and expect only happy, peaceful activities? Peace, though ideal in real life, is rather dull and does not bring viewers to a movie. And peace is, after all, usually achieved through violent war. And what is the ultimate peace? Death.I wanted to see this movie mostly because I wanted to see how violent it really was, how far Gibson would go. Indeed, he went far enough, and made a good point. Critics who dismiss this movie over the violence just don't get it. Yeah, so it was really violent, but it needs to be violent in order to get people's attention. People are evil and there is much pointless killing and hatred in this world. (Humans are not inherently ""good"" as some may believe.)The beginning quote about civilizations being destroyed only if they destroy themselves from within first seems to be true. Many people would completely blame the Europeans for the demise of the tribes - but if the Mayans hadn't started killing off each other first, there might have been enough manpower to overthrow the Europeans, especially if they were united. That's just a theory, of course. If you see this movie, you'll be pleasantly (or rather unpleasantly) surprised by how strongly it takes hold of you.",5,"Gore is necessary to show the depravity of mankind....,",1165622400,"12 9, 2006",2006,2265,"['was', 'totally', 'blown', 'away', 'film', 'lush', 'setting', 'tragic', 'characters', 'vividly', 'bloody', 'scenes.My', 'favorite', 'character', 'was', 'man', 'assumed', 'be', 'infertile', 'felt', 'sorry', 'others', 'made', 'fun', 'mother-in-law', 'repeatedly', 'told', 'was', 'worthless', 'then', 'later', 'separation', 'mother-in-law', 'was', 'so', 'touching', 'found', 'intriguing', 'society', 'blamed', 'man', 'infertility', 'most', 'cases', 'woman', 'blamed', 'fails', 'produce', 'child.But', 'anyway', 'strongest', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'temple', 'was', 'spared', 'obese', 'upper', 'class', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'giggled', 'pulled', 'mother', 'dress', 'impatience', 'perfectly', 'depicted', 'how', 'torture', 'entertainment', 'entitled', 'masses', 'obviously', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'ashamed', 'admit', 'liked', 'seeing', 'violence', 'as', 'much', 'masses', 'violence', 'here', 'was', 'so', 'shocking', 'so', 'striking', 'images', 'stay', 'awhile', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'expect', 'only', 'happy', 'peaceful', 'activities', 'Peace', 'ideal', 'real', 'life', 'rather', 'dull', 'not', 'bring', 'viewers', 'movie', 'peace', 'usually', 'achieved', 'violent', 'war', 'what', 'ultimate', 'peace', 'Death.I', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'mostly', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'violent', 'really', 'was', 'how', 'far', 'Gibson', 'would', 'go', 'Indeed', 'went', 'far', 'enough', 'made', 'good', 'point', 'Critics', 'who', 'dismiss', 'movie', 'violence', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Yeah', 'was', 'really', 'violent', 'be', 'violent', 'order', 'get', 'people', 'attention', 'People', 'are', 'evil', 'much', 'pointless', 'killing', 'hatred', 'world', 'Humans', 'are', 'not', 'inherently', 'good', 'may', 'believe', 'beginning', 'quote', 'civilizations', 'being', 'destroyed', 'only', 'destroy', 'first', 'be', 'true', 'Many', 'people', 'would', 'completely', 'blame', 'Europeans', 'demise', 'tribes', 'Mayans', 'had', ""n't"", 'started', 'killing', 'off', 'other', 'first', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'enough', 'manpower', 'overthrow', 'Europeans', 'especially', 'were', 'united', 'just', 'theory', 'course', 'see', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleasantly', 'rather', 'unpleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'strongly', 'hold']",N/A

1005754,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B000GNOKQG,"Maine Writer ""David""","[9, 17]","Apocalypto is a reminder. Of who we really are. Of where we come from. Of where we're going. As we walk alongside Jaguar Paw into the Mayan city, past disease, decay, and delirium, we can see ourselves -- just another chapter in the sordid tale of man's inhumanity to man. Of course, our make up is a little different, and we mutilate our bodies differently, too. Even our human sacrifices are different; our victims tend to be pre-natal. And while our music and culture have a slightly different rhythm, we're every bit as ruthless, every bit the mob, every bit as deluded.If anyone had questions about Mel Gibson's directorial skills, they're answered here. Likewise, there's ample evidence of his infatuation with viscera, with explicit depictions of flesh being ripped, gouged, sliced, and chopped. It felt like an anatomy lesson at times, with everything from the reproductive tract to the circulatory system on display. I generally dislike gruesome scenes in life and in movies, but, frankly, these scenes serve a larger purpose in Gibson's films. He puts us face to face with mortality, the spurting, pulsing reality of our flesh and blood. The fact that we die. The fact that it isn't pretty. The fact, more importantly I think, of how and why we kill each other. We live in a brutal world, folks. Eat or be eaten. That's how it is, no matter how we insulate ourselves from it. Sure, Gibson has the camera linger for a beat or two beyond what may have been necessary, but there's no disputing the guy has an artist's vision. A bit of a torture artist, no doubt, but I'll take art like this over the standard movie theater junk that's out there any day of the week.Some viewers may have a hard time separating Apocalypto from events in Gibson's personal life. Too bad for them. I don't know what's in Gibson's heart. None of us do. Like all of us, he's got a bit of the bigot in him. Of course, put in the context of the hammering he got from folks who never even watched his last film, one might understand, slightly, the pathology of it. That's no excuse, of course, but human beings are strange, screwed up, and generally indefensible. Gibson's no exception. That, however, does not make his storytelling, and his insights, any less impressive.This is a fine film, a true meditation on the human condition, and a welcome respite from all those folks who see the world in black and white -- those, for example, who view the white Europeans as the murderous thugs who obliterated the peaceful Native Americans. The reality, of course, is that we're all brutal thugs, and skin color is no defense.I'm not sure, by the way, whether Gibson got the Mayans mixed up with the Aztecs. The Mayans were far less known for their human sacrifices, and it would be interesting to hear from academics on this. There are some other potential historical inaccuracies I won't go into so as to spare the spoilers. Frankly, the story rises above historical circumstance, so these questions ought not get in the way of the Gibson's powerful message.I'm not much of a religious man, but as I walked out of the theater, I couldn't help but offer a silent prayer of the countless men and women who have died and suffered unspeakable brutality at the hands of their brothers and sisters. Not just the tens (or maybe hundreds) of thousands of Mayans and Aztecs stripped from their lives and marched to their horrifying ends, but so many others -- holocausts only varying in scale, skin color, and ethnicity.",4,Not for the squeamish.,1165622400,"12 9, 2006",2006,3491,"['Apocalypto', 'reminder', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'where', 'come', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', 'walk', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'Mayan', 'city', 'past', 'disease', 'decay', 'delirium', 'can', 'see', 'just', 'chapter', 'sordid', 'tale', 'man', 'inhumanity', 'man', 'course', 'make', 'up', 'little', 'different', 'mutilate', 'bodies', 'differently', 'too', 'Even', 'human', 'sacrifices', 'are', 'different', 'victims', 'tend', 'be', 'pre-natal', 'music', 'culture', 'have', 'slightly', 'different', 'rhythm', ""'re"", 'bit', 'ruthless', 'bit', 'mob', 'bit', 'deluded.If', 'anyone', 'had', 'questions', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'directorial', 'skills', ""'re"", 'answered', 'here', 'Likewise', 'ample', 'evidence', 'infatuation', 'viscera', 'explicit', 'depictions', 'flesh', 'being', 'ripped', 'gouged', 'sliced', 'chopped', 'felt', 'anatomy', 'lesson', 'times', 'everything', 'reproductive', 'tract', 'circulatory', 'system', 'display', 'generally', 'dislike', 'gruesome', 'scenes', 'life', 'movies', 'frankly', 'scenes', 'serve', 'larger', 'purpose', 'Gibson', 'films', 'face', 'face', 'mortality', 'spurting', 'pulsing', 'reality', 'flesh', 'blood', 'fact', 'die', 'fact', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'fact', 'more', 'importantly', 'think', 'how', 'why', 'kill', 'other', 'live', 'brutal', 'world', 'folks', 'Eat', 'be', 'eaten', 'how', 'matter', 'how', 'insulate', 'Sure', 'Gibson', 'camera', 'linger', 'beat', 'two', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'necessary', 'disputing', 'guy', 'artist', 'vision', 'bit', 'torture', 'artist', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'take', 'art', 'standard', 'movie', 'theater', 'junk', 'out', 'there', 'day', 'week.Some', 'viewers', 'may', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'separating', 'Apocalypto', 'events', 'Gibson', 'personal', 'life', 'Too', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Gibson', 'heart', 'None', 'do', 'got', 'bit', 'bigot', 'course', 'put', 'context', 'hammering', 'got', 'folks', 'who', 'never', 'even', 'watched', 'last', 'film', 'one', 'might', 'understand', 'slightly', 'pathology', 'excuse', 'course', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'strange', 'screwed', 'up', 'generally', 'indefensible', 'Gibson', 'exception', 'however', 'not', 'make', 'storytelling', 'insights', 'less', 'impressive.This', 'fine', 'film', 'true', 'meditation', 'human', 'condition', 'welcome', 'respite', 'folks', 'who', 'see', 'world', 'black', 'white', 'example', 'who', 'view', 'white', 'Europeans', 'murderous', 'thugs', 'who', 'obliterated', 'peaceful', 'Native', 'Americans', 'reality', 'course', ""'re"", 'brutal', 'thugs', 'skin', 'color', 'defense.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'way', 'Gibson', 'got', 'Mayans', 'mixed', 'up', 'Aztecs', 'Mayans', 'were', 'far', 'less', 'known', 'human', 'sacrifices', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'hear', 'academics', 'are', 'other', 'potential', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'spare', 'spoilers', 'Frankly', 'story', 'historical', 'circumstance', 'questions', 'ought', 'not', 'get', 'way', 'Gibson', 'powerful', 'message.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'religious', 'man', 'walked', 'theater', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'offer', 'silent', 'prayer', 'countless', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'died', 'suffered', 'unspeakable', 'brutality', 'hands', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'Not', 'just', 'tens', 'maybe', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'Mayans', 'Aztecs', 'stripped', 'lives', 'marched', 'horrifying', 'ends', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'only', 'varying', 'scale', 'skin', 'color', 'ethnicity']",N/A

Whether or not the actual Mayan civilization was like this is of course open to debate (and historians HAVE been debating this over and over since the films' release) - but what we have here borders on lunacy (and not even in a nice way).The story is simple - a tribe is captured to be offered as sacrifice to the Mayan Gods, and one man (i.e ""The Chosen One"" like Neo from ""The Matrix"") saves them all (sort of). Well at least he manages to save himself and his family. There is even a ridiculous child Oracle (again, like ""The Matrix"") who predicts the coming of the Chosen One.Thrown in an Eclipse, a black Jaguar, some quicksand, and lots of blood and hearts (literally) thrown around, and you have ""Apocalypto"" down pat. This is not a film for the faint of heart, but its not much of a film either. Rudy Youngblood (who is busy convincing us all in real life of his Native Indian roots) plays the young man who is the Neo of his generation, and the second half descends into a senseless chase - one disaster after the other, and oh, did I mention the blood and visceral body parts?The sad part of this whole thing is that it *could* have been tolerable had we given this project to a better director. Mel Gibson clearly has problems with race, religion and the universal belief system. At the end, the Mayans come across as Godless, barbaric and mindless creatures who 'deserved' to be conquered by the white race. Obviously this is not a good message.A very poor film - even purely as an action film, it falters quite badly. Very mildly recommended.

Yes, you get to relive the organs-being-pulled-from-the-body experience, also on a stage in front of a cheering mob. As one of my friends pointed out, Gibson has a thing about body paints, another loaner from BRAVEHEART. Too, Jaguar Paw periodically channels Gibson's PATRIOT character, albeit with a blowgun instead of a tomahawk, but you get the picture.I did like the fact that, as formulaic as the film was, there was at least an attempt to portray pre-Columbian mesoamericans. Yeah, they wore thongs and had weird Moe Howard haircuts, just like in INDIANA JONES (another contributor to the movie's elements), but they also had personalities, and the cinematography was good. And even though Gibson oversimplified the culture and religion, and compressed centuries of development into a timeframe of less than a week, he at least tried to get some of the details right, such as the language.Gibson has always been heavy-handed with symbolism and theme, spelling it out instead of letting these revelations come more subtly. And the arrival of European ships...what was THAT all about? That scene had nothing to do with the story.Critics have been all over this film for its inaccuracies, and those are valid complaints. But: compared to what? What other Mayan-civilization movies are better?It was undoubtedly contrived. But it sort of had to be. This is politically-incorrect to say, but watching a movie about the daily life of a primitive tribe isn't all that compelling. Think about it: hunt, cook meat, eat, hang around the hut, do over again the next day. What else is there?Well, okay: the body paint.

It sort of seemed anti-climatic to me as the 'mayan epic' turned into another Hollywood rehash.Gibson got allot of flack for doing this film in the original language, personally this was fine for me and I thought it added to the atmosphere of the film and provided an immersion into the film that english would not have.All in all, a decent film, beautifully filmed with interesting characters and a view of a society that we rarely (if ever) get to see a glimpse of.",4,Stunning visuals lead this semi-action film,1181347200,"06 9, 2007",2007,1124,"['really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'going', 'film', 'heard', 'hype', 'stories', 'Gibson', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'fail', 'film', 'bringing', 'visually', 'stunning', 'vision', 'film', 'scenes', 'Mayan', 'capital', 'made', 'head', 'swim', 'tried', 'envision', 'sheer', 'size', 'set', 'Here', 'are', 'also', 'most', 'graphic', 'portions', 'however', 'said', 'would', 'say', 'have', 'seen', 'much', 'worse', 'cinema', 'lately', 'was', 'nothing', 'compared', 'elsewhere.I', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'somewhat', 'let', 'down', 'when', 'film', 'turned', 'action', 'genre', 'last', '1/3', 'sort', 'mayan', 'version', 'First', 'Blood', 'lone', 'hero', 'outwit', 'outsmart', 'evil', 'men', 'perusing', 'turn', 'sort', 'seemed', 'anti-climatic', ""'mayan"", 'epic', 'turned', 'Hollywood', 'rehash.Gibson', 'got', 'allot', 'flack', 'doing', 'film', 'original', 'language', 'personally', 'was', 'fine', 'thought', 'added', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'provided', 'immersion', 'film', 'english', 'would', 'not', 'have.All', 'decent', 'film', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'interesting', 'characters', 'view', 'society', 'rarely', 'ever', 'get', 'see', 'glimpse']",N/A

1005763,APOUYO1BEPK22,B000GNOKQG,"M. B Cole ""Kegrun""","[1, 2]","Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and his fellow Mayan hunters are out on the hunt and having a good time in their secluded part of the wet jungle. After making a kill, they spread out some of the body parts, and then laugh at the expense of one of the bigger hunters because of the certain part that was given to him. Just having some good manly fun. Out from the jungle though come some strangers from another tribe. They look scared and beaten. With a warning about how their village was burned and ravaged, they pass by, onto hopefully a new beginning. The next morning, Jaguar's village gets attacked. People are slaughtered and huts are burned down. Jaguar hides his wife and child and then tries to help the rest of his people, only to get captured along with a group of others. They are taken back to the village of the capturers as slaves or quite possibly for a sacrificial ceremony. As the blade is nearing closer, and hope for rain is on the horizon, Jaguar must escape to save his wife and child, who are stuck in a 100-foot pit.Apocalypto was definitely a surprise. For one thing, I didn't know much about what I was getting into when first watching this. I thought maybe it was about why the Mayans disappeared actually (Duh...Aliens took them to outer space). But honestly it's just a story based around the Mayan timeframe. Accurate or not, I don't know. But I did like the movie. While some of the beginning is a little slow to some, I found it fun and interesting. It was nice to see them just joking around and having a good time with one another. As my fellow co-worker said, ""I wonder if they really talked or had fun like that"". For instance, they play a joke on one of their friends who seems to be impotent. They told him to rub some leaves on his `wing-wang', but didn't tell him they were chili leaves (I think they were at least).  This had him running around frantically naked and even his wife was burning up to (but in a spot you might not expect). The whole village was in hysterics. The action scenes were done really well also. Some say the violence was to extreme, but I don't think so at all. The sacrificing scenes were a tad rough, and I wouldn't let a child watch, but it wasn't too bad. Even `Temple of Doom' had a crazy sacrificing scene and no one really complains about that beating heart... do they? There was maybe a little to much of Jaguar Paw dodging spears and arrows though like he was Neo though, because they were coming from behind and he would always move his head or dodge something without even seeing it.With Jaguar Paws tribe, we also see how peaceful they were, to only have that ripped away from them in total bewilderment by the `evil' tribe. It was sad really and I honestly felt bad for them. Their children being hurt right in front of them, wives being raped or killed, husbands being slaughtered, and then tying up the prisoners to poles and making them trek back to the `evil' guys village. And even after that, I still thought about the bad guys. It had me thinking to myself, ""Are they all bad? Do they all agree with what's going on?"" Because it sure didn't feel like it sometimes. It had me wondering about the preparations before hand for them. Or maybe some of them think, ""Better them than me so I'll just do whatever it takes to survive in this tribe"" And when we do see the bad guys place of home, it seems just like any other type of city probably at that time, well... cept for the sacrificing and stuff. But hey, that's what they believed in. Even Abraham was going to sacrifice Isaac to his God at one time to appease him. I almost wish we got a little more on the bad guy tribe. Ah well.In the end, I would definitely give this a shot. While it is subtitled, it's not that bad at all (it never bothers me anyways) and you honestly forget you are reading within minutes...unless of course you are eating or something. It's got a lot of good action scenes in it, and it has a great story. Jaguar Paw rocks.P.S. - The scene with the Jaguar, although cool as it was, looked really bad. It reminded me of Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog from Conan. It really did look like a gigantic sock puppet in a few shots. How Mel Gibson approved that I'll never know. If I was Mel I would have got a real Jaguar and let him go to town on some animal carcass or something. Eh...whatever.",4,"Crikey, look of ever there, it's a Mayan. Isn't he beautiful.

First of all, let me start off by saying that this is really an original movie and idea.  Here we are witnessing a rather smaller group of tribal people that live in the jungle of South America, actually the area in and around Mexico.  It is, so to speak, a protrait of that famous Mayan civilization.  The group lives in and off the jungle, which means that it regularly hunts for food.  While most of the tribes that lived in the jungle are peaceful, this group has the bad luck of meeting with a predatory regimental group that is hell bent on killing all others who live in the jungle, and taking some of them as slaves.The protagonist of this movie, a young man called Jaguar Paw, is among those who become slaves of the predator tribe.  His story shows the tribulation of his captured groups members, until one day when he manages to escape.  What now happens is an incredible man-hunt for Jagaur Paw, especially since in the event of escaping, his killed the son of the commander of the ""army"" of that violent tribe.  I don't want to reveal too much of the rest of the story, suffice it to say, that it is really realistic, and especially the way that the movie was filmed was simply amazing.By the way, to keep the reallistic atmosphere of the movie in tact, the whole film is done with subtitles, leaving the actors to speak in their native language.

1005767,AHN34TYB15NWF,B000GNOKQG,"! Metamorpho ;) ""Reflective and Wiser Seer""","[3, 5]","Many years ago Mel Gibson called me on the phone to ask a favour. ""Metamorpho, how would you like a cameo role in the movie I'm making now? It's called Apocalypto."" After he told me it was about the Mayan Civilization, I agreed immediately. I was a little annoyed that it wasn't a starring role, but I suppose that's how the pyramid crumbles. I did wonder why he wanted me for the role, so I asked him. ""Because you have a good and brave heart Metamorpho,"" is all he said. To tell you the truth people, I was flattered. It didn't last long.However, I had no time for self-indulgence and went straight to Andy's Antediluvian Culture Costume Center for a wardrobe befitting an esteemed Seer. I picked up all sorts of items pertaining to my role (or so I assumed) as a Mayan Priest. Silver and turquoise jewelry, fine woven togas (red, blue and gold parrot patterns) and a Mayan headress that would make Sitting Bull weep.Yes, I was ready.Anyway, when I got to the set Mel said I didn't need all that attire. ""Why not?"", I inquired. ""Because we're going to paint you blue,"" is all he said. Well, I tell ya people, communication is really at an ebb these days. Yes, even with the internet. So, after hiding my disappointment I asked him for acting direction. ""No problem Metamorpho, just act terrified."" I knew that I was capable of that, after all, we all are considering modern day life.But, onwards to the movie itself. Apocalypto is set in the 1500's whereby we are exposed to a culture that no longer exists. The main character, Jaguar Paw, is a young Mayan who is part of a tribe, among many tribes, that frequent the jungle. He and his buddies hunt together, joke together, and share an idyllic existence until a band of warriors invade their village, burn their homes, kill half the people, and take the men prisoner. Flint Eye, Jaguar Paw's father, is killed in front of him but not before Flint Eye says to his son to not be afraid. This is a running theme that guides Jaguar Paw throughout the movie.The captives are then guided through the tracherous terrain of the jungle to a grand Mayan city. Here we are able to glimpse the astounding glory of this civilization. People from all classes, mull around the city, dressed and painted in an array of different ways. The temple pyramid is enormous and we are able to see the vastness of the city stretched out around it. The square, the marketplace, and other pyramids.In case you're wondering, Mel had me play one of the captives. It wasn't fun. Many mosquito bites along the way. But that wasn't the worst of it. Jaguar Paw and all of us were then painted blue and led to the top of the pyramid. From all indication it looked like we were going to be sacrificed to the Gods. I could tell by all the stray heads lying about. No, it wasn't pleasant. And I was thinking, if I get out of this, I am sending Mel a bill for all the clothes that weren't needed. (!)Anyway, we somehow survived and Jaguar Paw somehow managed to escape. I can't give you all the details here, but suffice to say I was impressed in the way that it was done. From this point on it is a chase by the warriors to kill Jaguar Paw. This is when your adrenalin starts to kick in as you see event after event unfold that make the chase even more suspenseful. Mel here, I feel, treats you to another motif. That the jungle, as threatening as it is, is no match for the inhumanity of man. The jungle, at least, can be understood and relied upon for empirical truths. Man, on the other hand, is the most threatening predator of all.There are all sorts of elements in this movie that relate to the overall picture. Too numerous to mention. However, the little leper girl who foretells the warriors ultimate destruction and Jaguar Paw's innate conviction of survival and conquering fear are most noteworthy. Mel paints a harsh and brutal reality, and in many ways it is juxtaposed against our current day world. Things haven't changed much, only the names don't remain the same.In the final analysis, this is a guy's flick. Through and through. Mel gives you more than your equal share of blood and gore. And, just when you think he's through, he gives you more, and then more. The movie is adventurous, harrowing, horrifying and yet you are somehow fascinated and lulled into this world. No, if you're looking for a soft, fuzzy and warm movie then look elsewhere. The Mayan's don't spare anyone, and neither does Mel.The bonus features here really give you an excellent view of how this movie was created. From the detailed building of the city to the painstaking make-up that is unique to the many characters in the film. After seeing this movie, it is clear to me that Mel has become a considerable and very talented director and producer. Whether or not his personal life becomes tarnished by the press, you cannot diminish his ability to tell an effective tale on film.In closing, it took me two days to wash off all the blue paint. I am just glad Mel decided not to mix it with a red colour. I wouldn't want to lose my head, after all. There are certainly more events than I've stated in this movie, but I don't want to disturb your morbid curiosity. Your heart will palpitate for sure.Dread that's read..........

As ""Braveheart"" was basically about  William Wallace, so Director Gibson smartly  uses one character as a repository of all his thematic material thereby focusing not diffusing our attention on something  upon which we cannot relate (though, to be truthful and based on Gibson's recent public outburst, you can't help wondering what the subtext here is...i.e. how this relates to our current political and religious situation): i.e. in this case the last days of a crumbling Mayan civilization which, out of desperation has put all its hopes in basically witch doctors who attempt to appeal to the ""Gods"" via human sacrifice.Jaguar Paw, as one of the many captured by the ruling tribe, is the center of our attention thereby making his plight personal. JP as portrayed by Rudy Youngblood is strong, handsome, brave, intelligent, a loving husband, son and parent. When he is captured and sent to be sacrificed, degraded by his captors, even then his innate goodness and bravery shine through.The Centerpiece of ""Apocalypto"" is the Temple scene at which the High Priest (a disgustingly smug Fernando Hernandez) spills the blood and removes the entrails of several men (the captured women are sold off like cattle) all in service of the ""Gods.""Gibson films this scene in what can only be called a frightening, crazy, frantic manner: the beheadings, the Royal family smirking, the thousands of citizens screaming for blood, the heads rolling down from the upper regions of the temple: the camera swirling all around from the frightened faces of the captives soon to be killed to the strange, almost immobile, because of face markings and headgear, grin of the King (a very weird looking Rafael Velez). The scene becomes almost unbearable because of the intensity with which it is staged and filmed...then Gibson pulls away.To me all that is important about Gibson as a director is that he makes good movies. And ""Apocalypto,"" though not up to the level of his ""Passion of The Christ"" is a very good movie. It's furiously paced, it's beautiful to watch, the acting is first rate and it is infused with the sounds and vistas of an almost mystical and very much mysterious time and place: a place and a time that Gibson brings alive by way of his special and profound magic.",5,Jaguar,1165968000,"12 13, 2006",2006,2746,"['Fascinating', 'Brutally', 'violent', 'times', 'historically', 'plausible', 'one', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'Mayans', 'civilization', 'hence', 'mystery', 'surrounded', 'centuries', 'yet', 'times', 'profoundly', 'touching', 'personal', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Apocalypto', 'said', 'done', 'shown', 'screen', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'terrific', 'Rudy', 'Youngblood', 'family', 'wife', 'Seven', 'played', 'Dalia', 'Hernandez', 'son', 'father', 'Braveheart', 'was', 'basically', 'William', 'Wallace', 'so', 'Director', 'Gibson', 'smartly', 'one', 'character', 'repository', 'thematic', 'material', 'thereby', 'focusing', 'not', 'diffusing', 'attention', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'relate', 'be', 'truthful', 'based', 'Gibson', 'recent', 'public', 'outburst', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'what', 'subtext', 'here', 'i.e', 'how', 'current', 'political', 'religious', 'situation', 'i.e', 'case', 'last', 'days', 'crumbling', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'desperation', 'put', 'hopes', 'basically', 'witch', 'doctors', 'who', 'attempt', 'appeal', 'Gods', 'human', 'sacrifice.Jaguar', 'Paw', 'one', 'many', 'captured', 'ruling', 'tribe', 'center', 'attention', 'thereby', 'making', 'plight', 'personal', 'JP', 'portrayed', 'Rudy', 'Youngblood', 'strong', 'handsome', 'brave', 'intelligent', 'loving', 'husband', 'son', 'parent', 'When', 'captured', 'sent', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'degraded', 'captors', 'even', 'then', 'innate', 'goodness', 'bravery', 'shine', 'through.The', 'Centerpiece', 'Apocalypto', 'Temple', 'scene', 'High', 'Priest', 'disgustingly', 'smug', 'Fernando', 'Hernandez', 'blood', 'entrails', 'several', 'men', 'captured', 'women', 'are', 'sold', 'off', 'cattle', 'service', 'Gods', 'Gibson', 'films', 'scene', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'called', 'frightening', 'crazy', 'frantic', 'manner', 'beheadings', 'Royal', 'family', 'smirking', 'thousands', 'citizens', 'screaming', 'blood', 'heads', 'rolling', 'down', 'upper', 'regions', 'temple', 'camera', 'swirling', 'frightened', 'captives', 'soon', 'be', 'killed', 'strange', 'almost', 'immobile', 'face', 'markings', 'headgear', 'grin', 'King', 'very', 'weird', 'looking', 'Rafael', 'Velez', 'scene', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'intensity', 'staged', 'filmed', 'then', 'Gibson', 'important', 'about', 'Gibson', 'director', 'good', 'movies', 'Apocalypto', 'not', 'level', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'furiously', 'paced', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'infused', 'sounds', 'vistas', 'almost', 'mystical', 'very', 'much', 'mysterious', 'time', 'place', 'place', 'time', 'Gibson', 'alive', 'way', 'special', 'profound', 'magic']",N/A

It is up to him to stay alive long enough and get back to where he left his wife and child before the oncoming rain will drown them.Why this is not a new tale, is because the way he is chased by the bad guys and how he deals with them, has been seen in many action flicks in the past.The movie is a good action tale and the use of subtitles is no problem.

So on Christmas Eve, my brother, my father, and I gathered around to watch a heartwarming family movie about human sacrifice.I knew a lot more about Aztec and Mayan culture than my relatives, so much of what happened (or was about to happen) took on special significance for me.  When Jaguar Paw's (Rudy Youngblood) tribe is attacked by the Aztecs and carried off instead of killed, we know it's not to live a life of slaves.  It's something much worse.Jaguar Paw's pregnant wife and young child manage to evade capture by lowering themselves into a well, but they're trapped there. If it rains, they drown.  If the Aztecs find them, they're sacrificed. And thus we have a race against time, as Jaguar Paw must both escape captivity and pursuit, all in an effort to save his young family from certain doom.Apocalypto encompasses everything you ever wanted to know about Aztecs.  It's all here: black panthers, Aztec martial prowess, steaming jungles, ziggurats, and a twist ending that ties it all neatly in a historical bow.  If the movie wasn't so violent, high school teachers every would be showing this movie as a snapshot of history.The violence is actually not that bad.  A scene where an Aztec is mauled by a panther is more graphic than the heart sacrifices performed atop the grisly temples. Much more exciting are the thrilling chase and combat sequences, some of the best on foot.Given that this is a film about a time before modern convention, it's amazing how Gibson fits in movie conventions usually associated with car chases.  There are twists in Jaguar Paw's escape and his hunt by the Aztecs that are worthy of any action movie.Did I mention that this entire movie is subtitled?  The movie's so enthralling that you stop noticing it a few seconds in. Apocalypto's that good. Sure, it's a blood-drenched action thriller in another language.

Mel Gibson - fresh off of his Passion of the Christ work, in which he laughed at traditional movie distribution all the way to the bank - decided to try his hand at the ancient civilization equation with his Mayan epic Apocalypto.As the title suggests, this is a story about the beginning of the end of the Mayan civilization, as told through the narrative of Jaguar Paw. His village invaded, and his people captured, Jaguar Paw is trekked across the Mexican jungle to a great Mayan city to be sacrificed. His only goal: surviving to get back to his wife, whom he left down a shallow cavern to save her.Jaguar Paw's ordeal is your traditional action/adventure, but his story allows Mel Gibson to give viewers a glimpse into the world of the declining Mayan civilization during a time of an immense drought, wanning resources, and resulting in a large number of human sacrifices.The movie, for the most part, is historically accurate, with some liberties taken to enhance the awe of the spectacle. Many people have complained about the movie being inherently racist with its portrayal of the Mayan's as bloodthirsty savages; and though I will admit that the scientific and mathematical accomplishments of the Maya were glossed over in favor of the human sacrifice, we do know that a great deal of human sacrifice did occur during the Mayan decline. Gibson may have portrayed the Maya as overtly savage, but the scenes between Zero Wolf and his son showed compassion, and the city scenes showed a complex society built on more than just bloodshed.Another complaint that a few had, was that they felt Gibson was portraying the conquistadores at the end as the ""saviors with crosses"" of these savage people. I disagree. If this were the case, then Jaguar Paw would have been ""saved"" by the them. Instead, he returns to his wife and seeks a ""new beginning"" deeper into the forest, away from the Spanish.The DVD contains a nice documentary about the making of the film. Particularly interesting is the making of the city and costumes. The deleted scenes - or should I say scene - only contains one brief moment where an injured deer passes by.The film itself is phenomenally entertaining and anyone caught up in the 2012 meme - or anyone who's an ancient cultures buff - would do themselves a good deed by sitting down and watching it.",4,All Around Solid Movie,1309132800,"06 27, 2011",2011,2563,"['2012', 'meme', 'hot', 'minds', 'alternative', 'archeologists', 'occultists', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'rest', 'crazy', 'people', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'started', 'steep', 'upward', 'climb', 'back', 'minds', 'modern', 'civilizations', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'fresh', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'work', 'laughed', 'traditional', 'movie', 'distribution', 'way', 'bank', 'decided', 'try', 'hand', 'ancient', 'civilization', 'equation', 'Mayan', 'epic', 'Apocalypto.As', 'title', 'story', 'beginning', 'end', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'told', 'narrative', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'village', 'invaded', 'people', 'captured', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'trekked', 'Mexican', 'jungle', 'great', 'Mayan', 'city', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'only', 'goal', 'surviving', 'get', 'back', 'wife', 'whom', 'left', 'down', 'shallow', 'cavern', 'save', 'her.Jaguar', 'Paw', 'ordeal', 'traditional', 'action/adventure', 'story', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'give', 'viewers', 'glimpse', 'world', 'declining', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'time', 'immense', 'drought', 'wanning', 'resources', 'resulting', 'large', 'number', 'human', 'sacrifices.The', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'historically', 'accurate', 'liberties', 'taken', 'enhance', 'awe', 'spectacle', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'movie', 'being', 'inherently', 'portrayal', 'Mayan', 'bloodthirsty', 'savages', 'will', 'admit', 'scientific', 'mathematical', 'accomplishments', 'Maya', 'were', 'glossed', 'favor', 'human', 'sacrifice', 'do', 'know', 'great', 'deal', 'human', 'sacrifice', 'did', 'occur', 'Mayan', 'decline', 'Gibson', 'may', 'have', 'portrayed', 'Maya', 'overtly', 'savage', 'scenes', 'Zero', 'Wolf', 'son', 'showed', 'compassion', 'city', 'scenes', 'showed', 'complex', 'society', 'built', 'more', 'just', 'bloodshed.Another', 'complaint', 'few', 'had', 'was', 'felt', 'Gibson', 'was', 'portraying', 'conquistadores', 'end', 'saviors', 'crosses', 'savage', 'people', 'disagree', 'were', 'case', 'then', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'saved', 'Instead', 'wife', 'new', 'beginning', 'deeper', 'forest', 'away', 'Spanish.The', 'DVD', 'nice', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'Particularly', 'interesting', 'making', 'city', 'costumes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'should', 'say', 'scene', 'only', 'one', 'brief', 'moment', 'where', 'injured', 'deer', 'by.The', 'film', 'phenomenally', 'entertaining', 'anyone', 'caught', 'up', '2012', 'meme', 'anyone', 'who', 'ancient', 'cultures', 'buff', 'would', 'do', 'good', 'deed', 'sitting', 'down', 'watching']",N/A

This quote by Will Durant flashes on the screen at the beginning of APOCALYPTO and signals the message of the movie: a morally and economically troubled Mayan civilization is ""rotten ripe for the fall"", to quote another source, and the Conquistadors are landing on the Yucatan Peninsula to do the job. APOCALYPTO goes about showing us this rot that is a brutal, bloody, inhuman Mayan society while telling a classic action-chase tale. Jaguar Paw, a warrior in a small village, is captured by ruthless Mayan soldiers and taken back to the Mayan capital city to be sacrificed with others from his village on a pyramid. He manages to escape and is chased by Mayan fighters through the jungle.So much for the plot. What about the theme suggested by Will Durant? The film makes a good argument that the Mayans were vulnerable but even a morally sound, economically strong Mayan society could not have defeated the Spanish. Why? Because, while the Spanish were small in number, they had horses, muskets, steel swords, and head and chest armor. Not only that: the Spanish were just as ruthless as the Mayans. There was no way even a healthy Mayan civilization could have fended off the Spanish; it may have taken just a litle longer before the inevitable end.APOCALYPTO is brilliant movie-making and grand entertainment.

Every rustle of the grass, every whisker of the jaguar's face, was picked out with astonishing clarity. I almost felt I had to wipe the humidity of the jungle off my brow as I watched it. The story is a straightforward tale of a community ripped apart by violent outsiders and the struggle for one of its inhabitants to flee from his captors and return to his doomed family. But it is in such simplicity that the story is made. The villains are bad beyond redemption and you long for their deaths, you root for the hero from the moment he is taken, and you prey for a happy ending to his plight - may his family be saved. Gibson knows exactly what he is doing and the viewer actually cares about what they are watching. Before viewing the movie, I was troubled about the level of violence contained in the film and, whilst there is undoubtedly some gore - ripping out a beating heart is never going to be pretty - I found nothing that wasn't essential to the plot or added to the menacing atmosphere of the period depicted.

As an archaeologist, I was also drawn into the debate about authenticity but such thoughts were quickly banished by the pulsating intensity and sheer brilliance of the film. Similarly, the subtitles are forgotten and the foreign language even adds to the feeling that what you are witnessing is real; this actually happened.

1005779,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000GNOKQG,mirasreviews,"[4, 5]","""Apocalypto"" presents a fresh variation on the staple action movie storyline of an Everyman who goes to extraordinary lengths to save his family from peril. Director and co-writer Mel Gibson has made a career of heroic men who emerge from mundane circumstances to combat threats to loved ones, first as an actor, now as a director. Having told this story in Medieval Scotland, apocalyptic Down Under, and present-day Los Angeles, Gibson places his classic hero on a new canvas: Mayan civilization circa 1500. For those who crave action, primitive weaponry and hand-to-hand combat prove as compelling as explosions and machine guns. As gruesome violence is also a Gibson tradition, there is plenty of that too.In the jungle of early 16th century Central America, tribespeople go about their daily business. Young men hunt and make jokes, elders dole out advice and stories, and families enjoy one another's company. The idyll is shattered one morning when a group of Holcane warriors raid the village, burn it to the ground, take prisoners, and kill almost indiscriminately. A young man named Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) manages to conceal his pregnant wife (Dalia Hernandez) and son in a nearby pit before he is captured. He and his fellow captives are marched through jungle, river, and hills until they reach a city. The Mayans are a civilization in crisis, plagued by disease, crop failure, and famine.  Desperate to appease their gods, they have gruesome plans for the prisoners. But Jaguar Paw is determined to return to his forest and his family, who need his help to get out of the pit.The pregnant woman in peril and the relentless young husband are cliches. And it's hokey for a person named Jaguar Paw to be saved by a jaguar, which he happens to run into up a tree. But this is an environment we're not used to seeing, and ""Apocalypto"" effectively builds suspense in spite of its predictability. The only time it ran out of steam for me was during the jungle chase, which resembles ""The Perils of Pauline"" after a while. What most impressed me about ""Apocalypto"" is the meticulously recreated Mayan aesthetic. The piercings, tattoos, and scarifications can be off-putting, and that's before we arrive in the city, where the wealthy proudly display jade-inlaid teeth and huge headdresses. But it grew on me. After a while, I caught on to this concept of beauty, and it became glamorous and alluring.Much has been made of historical inaccuracies in this film, but I don't think its sins are so grievous. Elements from Mayan classic and post-classic periods are combined for aesthetic reasons, and fictions such as the human target game and, I assume, the tapir trap are added to enhance the action and showcase Mayan weaponry. That kind of thing will drive a historian nuts, but laypeople shrug it off. Although Jaguar Paw is imbued with modern, middle-class values, and the film's thematic framing device, ""a great civilization in not conquered from without, until it has destroyed itself from within"", necessitates muddling of dates, this seems to me a good introduction to Mayan civilization -largely because we get to see what these people looked like, with the help of a recreated city and 700 extras. All dialogue in ""Apocalypto"" is Yucatec Maya, which is not the actors' native language. English subtitles.The DVD (Touchstone 2007): There is a making-of documentary, one deleted scene (30 sec), and an audio commentary. ""Becoming Mayan: Creating Apocalypto"" (25 min) interviews Mel Gibson and co-writer Farhad Safinia about locations in Mexico and building the Mayan city. Other members of the creative team talk about recreating the Mayans through costumes and make-up. Weapons consultant Simon Atherton discusses Mayan weaponry. The audio commentary is by writer/director/ producer Mel Gibson and co-writer/co-producer Farhad Safinia. This casual commentary doesn't have as much historical information as I would have liked. But it does provide some Mayan background, as well as discussions of lighting, the intentions behind some scenes, and filming anecdotes.

I tend to think he just wanted to make a darn good action movie, but in a setting we never see in movies - the Mayan culture.  If I am right, then he succeeded well, and warrants my 4 stars.However, there is a little more in the movie that might suggest he was reaching for something more. The story is in two broad parts.  After an introduction to a bucolic life in the jungle with hunting and breeding the topics for discussion and frivolity, the movies real first part kicks off with a brutal attack on the village, and the survivors being taken away into slavery.  The only people left behind are our heroes wife and child, who remain trapped in a well unless he returns, giving our protagonist his motivation.  Thus the second part is the gruelling and cruel march to the Mayan city, which is almost like a Sodom and Gomorrah in its wickedness and depravity, the very essence of a city and culture in decay.  Our hero escapes from an apparently certain death, and the third part is a chase as he is hunted down, and he seeks to return to his family to rescue them.It's all cannily put together as a whole, and also in its memorable if gory individual scenes.  The director's eye for a breathtaking shot is undeniable - I was reminded of the beauty of `The Mission' during the waterfall scene - not an unfair comparison in many ways.  The success of the movie is largely due to its script (ironically, given the subtitles) which really draws us in to the characters lives and makes us care at least a bit.  And for action, the final chase scene makes our hero something like Schwarzenegger in Predator as he uses the jungle against the city folk to great effect.So a 4 or even 5 star action movie then?  Yes, but there is then that added ambiguous element - as set out in the opening quote referring to civilisation in decline, there are real similiarities, even in such an obscure scenario, to modern day.  Just enough to make you think about it if you want to, but not enough to hammer any point home.  The final few shots in particular are effective in tying up the movie in a slightly unexpected way.  In another unexpected and only lightly touched upon theme, the final third of the movie is foretold in a rather spooky scene, giving an oddly spiritual or supernatural element to an otherwise very visceral and down to earth story.If he set out to make a message movie, then the movie only half succeeded - but as an action movie with the balls and cleverness to make you leave the cinema thinking?

Durham ""Big Evil""","[1, 2]","No matter what you may think of Mel Gibson, you have to admit that the man knows how to get your attention, and Apocalypto is sheer proof of that.  Mainly revolving around Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), the film centers around the declining Mayan culture, desperate to survive by offering frequent human sacrifices after raiding and pillaging near by villages.  Desperate to be re-united with his pregant wife and young son, Jaguar Paw escapes, and seeks bloody revenge on his pursuers.  What helps make Apocalypto so surprisingly good is the sense of dread that Gibson manages to create, as well as the surprising amount of action set pieces as well.  Seriously, Apocalypto features enough bloody action that you may think you've stumbled across John Rambo in some scenes, but this helps make the film's 138 minute running time breeze by.  Not to mention how startlingly poignant the film becomes as well before degrading into a cat and mouse chase through the jungle.

1005791,A3SU3TXON36T0X,B000GNOKQG,"New Age of Barbarism ""zosimos""","[3, 6]","A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within.  -  W. Durant._Apocalypto_ (2006) is an excellent film directed by Mel Gibson that details the decline of Mayan civilization through the life of a young Indian who strives to protect his family.  Gibson's genius is apparent throughout the film as he effectively captures the atmosphere of this lost once great civilization.  The movie has much to say about man's tendency to over-reach his natural status within the world and through a Faustian bargain with demonic forces to eventually destroy both himself and nature.  The movie also is highly pertinent to our own times, in which Western civilization itself faces an imminent decline and through over-extension man has reached into once ""primitive"" and untapped regions of nature and demolished them.  The underlying force of Gibson's traditional Catholicism is apparent throughout the film, and at different places within the film the Mayan mythology appears to be aping the Catholic ritual.  To the Roman Catholic Christian, the appearance of elements in traditional cultures which bear a marked similarity to its own ritual are of no surprise as God reveals himself to all nations through Christ.  Gibson also shows the arrival of the Spaniards to Mexico in the film and presumably they will attempt to Christianize this fallen civilization that has become hopelessly corrupt by resorting to human sacrifice and chattel slavery and thus is in desperate need of Christ.  The movie treats the traditional Indian cultures with great respect and reverence, particularly that of the tribe of Jaguar Paw (the central character in this movie played by the Native American actor Rudy Youngblood).  However, the movie does not refrain from showing the brutality of the ancient Mayans who preyed off the forest tribes and whose sun god Kulkukan (the Mayan equivalent of Quetzalcoatl) demands human blood.  Gibson maintains that such cultural degradation can only foretell the coming doom of a civilization as is revealed in history through the Spanish conquerors.  The actors in the film all speak the Yucatec Mayan language throughout and the film relies on subtitles.  Gibson has claimed that the effect of hearing a foreign language spoken in a film (as he also did in his _Passion of the Christ_  with Aramaic) is important.The movie begins with Jaguar Paw, his father Flint Sky, and several fellow tribesmen hunting a tapir in the jungle.  It is noted by Flint Sky that his own father hunted this same jungle, that his son continues to hunt it, and that his son's son will hunt it after him, thus establishing the continuity of primordial tradition.  Such is the traditional way of life for the world's ""primitive"" nature-loving peoples.  It is after capturing the tapir that the tribesmen encounter a second traumatized tribe who tell of a coming doom.  Their own village has been ravished.  Jaguar Paw and his fellows return to their village but first Flint Sky tells him that he must resolve not to fear.  That night, one of the village elders tells a foreboding fable of human beings never fulfilling their wants and desires.  Perhaps this fable is an allegory for the greater environmental degradation (and the destruction of the very rain forest itself) which has occurred in our own times.  Jaguar Paw awakes from a prophetic and horrifying nightmare only to find that his village is being invaded by raiders.  The raiders ransack the village and kill many, raping the women, and leaving the children.  However, just before the village is destroyed and he himself is captured, Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and young son at the bottom of a pit where they are to remain for the rest of the movie.  Perhaps the pregnant wife in the pit (the cave?) is meant to be reminiscent of the very Virgin Mary herself from Gibson's own religious tradition.  (The Virgin is to occur again in the prayers of one of the women as a slave for the lost children.)  Jaguar Paw and his villagers are taken away as slaves by the raiders and must trek through the jungle to arrive at the Mayan city.  There they are to be sacrificed on top of a step pyramid to the god Kulkukan.  The sacrificial ritual is meant to be reminiscent of the Roman mass.  The movie features an eclipse and an eerie prophecy followed by a horrendous occurrence at the ball field.  Following this Jaguar Paw runs through the jungle pursued by his enemies driven by pure hatred.  To see the resolution of the movie, and whether or not Jaguar Paw manages to save his pregnant wife and young son, you must watch it.  It should be noted though that the Christian theme becomes apparent again when Spanish missionaries and conquistadores show up in ships towards the end.  Thus, begins anew the history of the Americas.Mel Gibson has directed an excellent film in _Apocalypto_.  The movie includes humor but also much seriousness and bloodshed.  (Unfortunately this film is not to be recommended to the overly squeamish who may find certain scenes too upsetting, but to those few brave souls who can bear some of the more gruesome scenes the film has a positive message for all.)  The atmosphere is well done and the scenery and environment is accurate.  The movie is also historically interesting and Gibson has certainly done his homework on this ancient culture.  However, it is the central theme and allegorical nature of this film which I believe is most important for us today.  It tells us that we must stop over-extending ourselves and destroying nature and the traditional ways of life of ""primitive"" peoples.  Ultimately however, our hope must rest with God himself who effectively guides our destiny as a race.",5,Apocalypto - The Decline of Civilizations.,1182384000,"06 21, 2007",2007,5736,"['great',

Breaveheart was probably the first big movie that looked at English colonialism in Europe.  Likewise this movie, which he purportedly funded himself, is probably the biggest movie out there about the experience of Native Americans prior to the arrival of Europeans.  The ""native"" characters are played entirely by actors and actresses of Native American descent.  And they speak the correct native language for that time and place; Quecha.  Set right before the arrival of the Spaniards, the movie also shows the complex world of Central American societies at that time, such as the religious beliefs, social organization, and accomplished skills in construction and architecture; all done without metal tools or parts!  Like other Gibson movies, there is an abundance of inter-personal violence, most of it quite realistic and bloody.  Underlying this visual spectacle are story themes rehashed from hundreds of other movies.  These include the trials of the main protagonist, who, though injured, outlasts and kills of most of a hunting party chasing him down.  This latter chase scene is quite reminiscent of many Rambo movies.  Of course he does this to save his pregnant wife and son; which is a storyline found over and over again, including in a previous Gibson flick; The Patriot.  Overall, this movie is quite good; it puts the audience in a world few of us will ever think of, let alone heard of.  The special effects are top notch, as are the action scenes.

That they deserved to be conquered and enslaved themselves?I could go on and on, but this quote from a review by XeniaisGod on IMDB sums it up nicely for me: ""Why disguise a C-level slasher flick as an historical epic? If your true calling as a director is directing films that are thin on plot and gratuitously violent, why not just direct The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part Deux?""Unfortunately, the fact that all characters speak native languages adds a realistic feel to this production. I wouldn't be surprised if most people walked away from it with the impression that the Maya were some sort of meso-American Romans.

Like ""The Passion"", Gibson immerses the viewer in an epic tale and an exotic culture, complete with original languages and subtitles.  The visual beauty of the production is undeniable, and the human drama of the story is played out with stark, often gut-wrenching intensity.Counterbalancing these strengths is, in my opinion, a shallowness to the story and the main characters.  The indomitable spirit of Jaguar Paw is the key feature, coupled closely with his love for his wife and son.  These attributes are expressed by a defiance and tenacity both in battle and in capture, as well as in the seemingly endless pursuit sequence that dominates the second half of the movie and, quite frankly, gets more than a little old after about the first 20 or 30 minutes.  Yet on and on it drags until the final predictable defeat of the pursuers and rescue of his family.Overall I would rate this movie as definitely worth watching, both for the excellence of the production and the tragic drama it portrays.

If you are Roman Catholic, you may deeply sigh. As a pagan, you may even despair.As a Born-again, King James Bible-toting, Vietnam and Desert Storm Christian veteran for Kerry, I rejoice to see Mr. Gibson going through a major change in his life, as reflected in his new masterpiece.... We join him 'in camera' in the opening tracking shot, penetrating the dense rainforest (there are no subtitled or written narrative clues as to just where we are...) to join a hunt in progress. The last shot of the film shows the Jag Paw family disappearing into the jungle, while the camera stops after the last line about a 'new beginning'. We do not follow. The hero has survived the hunt; the hunters, having 'heard' the prophecy of a little girl, are drawn to their fate in a new faith, which will prove (to this day!) their undoing. Has Mel Gibson 'heard' of a new Way of life? Has he as it were 'begun again'? Has the 'hole in his soul' (the one-armed old man quoting the Owl during the fireside story) been finally filled? I am going to say that the prayers of a thousand filled souls have been answered. The overarching theme in this film, IMHO, is ""Divine Providence"": there is a supreme Being Who is in total control at all times in all places of the most intimate details of His creation.

I thought that it was bloody and graphic and that is not the kind of thing that I am into.  When my husband convinced me to watch it with him, I was awestruck.  Yes, there is a lot of blood and violence, but the characters themselves are more important.  Yes, a few scences caused me to turn my head--but only for a few seconds because I just hand to find out what happended to the characters.  The characters, especially Jaguar Paw and his family, are so compelling that I was brought to tears more than once. Really superb acting, and a nice mix of dramatic, tragedy and humor.  I think, for those of you who appreciated Pan's Labrynth on a dramatic level (and not so much for its fanatsy element) will appreciate this movie also.  Those of you who are sticklers for historical accuracy might be miffed at the cultural mixing (a point my husband picked up on) but I who do not know a lot about these cultures did not catch these inaccuracies.

1005816,AAC2GHQF1TG4I,B000GNOKQG,"Ramon Thomas ""Professional Speaker""","[5, 7]","This past weekend I finally watched the new Mel Gibson film: Apocalypto. This film is set in the ancient Maya civilisation just before the arrival of the first Europeans. It's graphic in it's violence and it's portrayal of the capturing of one tribe by another to be used as slaves and for ritual sacrifice is gruesome indeed.This movie really made me think about the link between fear and courage. This was first brought to my attention by Dr Paul Dobransky, a noted psychiatrist and author ofThe Secret Psychology of How We Fall in Love. Basically it goes like this when you are afraid you need courage to do the things that bring fear into your life. When you do courages things it fills up the amount of confidence you have to do other things which may bring feels of fear into your life. Susan Jeffers also wrote an excellent little book,Feel the Fear . . . and Do It Anyway (r)Now back to Apocalypto. This movie is set in the jungle's of Mesoamerica and right from the beginning it's very much an adrenalin rush with the capture of a wild boar. Soon after the capture the son of the tribal leader, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), through intuition or through sharp senses, gets up, turns around and calls out to what turns out to be a huge tribe in migration, to come out of hiding. This tribe is on the run from slave hunters if you can call them such. Flint Sky, the father of Jaguar Paw, reminds his son not to be afraid. He says to these tribal people moving through their forest, something like this: I am Flint Stone! This is my forest. This is my forest! My father hunted in this forest before me, and my sons will hunt here after I am gone! This is a quote that will be repeated by Jaguar Paw later on in the film.Soon afterwards the village of Jaguar Paw is pillaged by same slave hunters. The Mayan priests and  through them, the king, had ordained that more sacrifice is needed to purify the lands, improve the crop harvest and to save them all. The society had been in decline for a number of years. There is elements of the film that is not historically accurate but this has nothing to do with how powerful a message it conveys regarding how to overcome fear with courage. Just before he is about to be executed a solar eclipse takes place and all the ritual sacrifices is stopped. It's not over for the captures slaves as the high priest orders them killed. Through some tough determination Jaguar Paw outmanoeuvres the hunters who had captures him and manages to escape into the forest.And here is where he's courage is brought to the fore. His confidences increases as he gets deeper into the forest. Now just as his village was being attacked he managed to get his newly pregnant wife and son into a deep hole. And this is part of what drives him to keep going. The fact that he has to rescue them before it rains, and they drown. As the hunters close in on him he fights them off in different ways. The most exhilarating scene in the movie could be when he jumps over a waterfall. When you consider how some of the hunters following him hesitate and end up being killed because of bad jumps over the same waterfall you realise how superior Jaguar Paw's confidence has become. He is not afraid to take risks and he places himself directly in the line of fire on several occasions. With speed and agility he overcomes great obstacles in the chase. Overall though you can start to see how living in the moment, the now, brings you closer to your true self. It brings you closer to nature and your instincts can take over. Now in a modern, westernised, technologically advances society we live in there is absolutely nothing that pushes us in the same way to develop our confidence, our courage and our instincts. To a large extent we become nothing more than automatons doing repetitive things over and over. Our ability to overcome fear when confronted by it is reduces because of this group behaviour and placating activity we call living today.",5,Apocalypto death to fear and courage reborn,1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,3967,"['past', 'weekend', 'finally', 'watched', 'new', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'film', 'Apocalypto', 'film', 'set', 'ancient', 'Maya', 'civilisation', 'just', 'arrival', 'first', 'Europeans', 'graphic', 'violence', 'portrayal', 'capturing', 'one', 'tribe', 'be', 'used', 'slaves', 'ritual', 'sacrifice', 'gruesome', 'indeed.This', 'movie', 'really', 'made', 'think', 'link', 'fear', 'courage', 'was', 'first', 'brought', 'attention', 'Dr', 'Paul', 'Dobransky', 'noted', 'psychiatrist', 'author', 'ofThe', 'Secret', 'Psychology', 'How', 'Fall', 'Love', 'Basically', 'when', 'are', 'afraid', 'need', 'courage', 'do', 'things', 'bring', 'fear', 'life', 'When', 'do', 'courages', 'things', 'up', 'amount', 'confidence', 'have', 'do', 'other', 'things', 'may', 'bring', 'feels', 'fear', 'life', 'Susan', 'Jeffers', 'also', 'wrote', 'excellent', 'little', 'book', 'Feel', 'Fear', 'Do', 'Anyway', 'r', 'Now', 'back', 'Apocalypto', 'movie', 'set', 'jungle', 'Mesoamerica', 'right', 'beginning', 'very', 'much', 'adrenalin', 'rush', 'capture', 'wild', 'boar', 'Soon', 'capture', 'son', 'tribal', 'leader', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'Rudy', 'Youngblood', 'intuition', 'sharp', 'senses', 'up', 'around', 'out', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'huge', 'tribe', 'migration', 'come', 'hiding', 'tribe', 'run', 'slave', 'hunters', 'can', 'call', 'such', 'Flint', 'Sky', 'father', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'son', 'not', 'be', 'afraid', 'tribal', 'people', 'moving', 'forest', 'something', 'am', 'Flint', 'Stone', 'forest', 'forest', 'father', 'hunted', 'forest', 'sons', 'will', 'hunt', 'here', 'am', 'gone', 'quote', 'will', 'be', 'repeated', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'later', 'film.Soon', 'village', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'pillaged', 'same', 'slave', 'hunters', 'Mayan', 'priests', 'king', 'had', 'ordained', 'more', 'sacrifice', 'needed', 'purify', 'lands', 'improve', 'crop', 'harvest', 'save', 'society', 'had', 'been', 'decline', 'number', 'years', 'elements', 'film', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'nothing', 'do', 'how', 'powerful', 'message', 'regarding', 'how', 'overcome', 'fear', 'courage', 'Just', 'be', 'executed', 'solar', 'eclipse', 'place', 'ritual', 'sacrifices', 'stopped', 'not', 'captures', 'high', 'priest', 'orders', 'killed', 'tough', 'determination', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'hunters', 'who', 'had', 'captures', 'manages', 'escape', 'forest.And', 'here', 'where', 'courage', 'brought', 'fore', 'confidences', 'deeper', 'forest', 'Now', 'just', 'village', 'was', 'being', 'attacked', 'managed', 'get', 'newly', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'son', 'deep', 'hole', 'part', 'what', 'keep', 'going', 'fact', 'rescue', 'drown', 'hunters', 'close', 'off', 'different', 'ways', 'most', 'exhilarating', 'scene', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'when', 'waterfall', 'When', 'consider', 'how', 'hunters', 'following', 'hesitate', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'killed', 'bad', 'jumps', 'same', 'waterfall', 'realise', 'how', 'superior', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'confidence', 'become', 'not', 'afraid', 'take', 'risks', 'directly', 'line', 'fire', 'several', 'occasions', 'speed', 'agility', 'great', 'obstacles', 'chase', 'can', 'start', 'see', 'how', 'living', 'moment', 'now', 'closer', 'true', 'self', 'closer', 'nature', 'instincts', 'can', 'take', 'over', 'Now', 'modern', 'westernised', 'technologically', 'society', 'live', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'same', 'way', 'develop', 'confidence', 'courage', 'instincts', 'large', 'extent', 'become', 'nothing', 'more', 'automatons', 'doing', 'repetitive', 'things', 'over', 'ability', 'overcome', 'fear', 'when', 'confronted', 'reduces', 'group', 'behaviour', 'placating', 'activity', 'call', 'living', 'today']",N/A
1005817,A3FOSBM4MMUFER,B000GNOKQG,Randal J. Batty,"[2, 2]","There is simply no other film that can be accurately compared to ""Apocalypto.""  The mere fact that it was brought to film is amazing.  While the film concentrates on a period of time between the flourishment of the Mayans and the infiltration of the Spanish, we know that that period spanned decades, and the film gives us a glimpse of the not-so-untroubled times for the local natives.  While the Mayans were flourishing, the civilization was also hopelessly corrupt in a moral/spiritual sense.  Their regular blood sacrifices of human beings to their gods displays a kind of inner moral bankruptcy -- from which there was no return.  Our view of this ""great"" civilization is through the eyes of a captive villager, and, along with him, we are aghast at the decadence, the absolute indifference of individual life, the waste, the barbarism.  By mere chance, coincidence or providence, our protagonist is able to escape immediate extinction.  Most of the movie focuses on his adrenalin-filled run through the jungles -- with hopes of returning to his wife and son -- both left in a virtual pit of hopelessness and despair.  The odds seem insurmountable.  Wounded, exhausted, shocked, our protagonist moves ahead -- at first with a pure sense of instinct then with his father's remembrance to feel no fear.  These qualities, along with some very good luck allow him to gain an advantage over his relentless (and scary) adversaries.  Nothing seems predictable here.  Advantages soon turn sour.  It is only the uncanny willpower and perseverance of our protagonist that seems to propel him from capture and death.  All spoken in a native tongue (with subtitles), the viewer is immersed in a point of unspeakable horror, chance and endurance.  This film is unlike any other that I've seen.  It's very, very powerful movie making.  This is the best-directed film by Mel Gibson, and I can only hope that the Hollywood circuit allows him to go forward and explore new, unseen dimensions of the human experience.",4,Apocalypto - Most Original Film in Decades,1299715200,"03 10, 2011",2011,2004,"['simply', 'other', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'accurately', 'compared', 'Apocalypto', 'mere', 'fact', 'was', 'brought', 'film', 'amazing', 'film', 'period', 'time', 'flourishment', 'Mayans', 'infiltration', 'Spanish', 'know', 'period', 'spanned', 'decades', 'film', 'glimpse', 'not-so-untroubled', 'times', 'local', 'natives', 'Mayans', 'were', 'flourishing', 'civilization', 'was', 'also', 'hopelessly', 'moral/spiritual', 'sense', 'regular', 'blood', 'sacrifices', 'human', 'beings', 'gods', 'kind', 'inner', 'moral', 'bankruptcy', 'was', 'return', 'view', 'great', 'civilization', 'eyes', 'captive', 'villager', 'are', 'aghast', 'decadence', 'absolute', 'indifference', 'individual', 'life', 'waste', 'barbarism', 'mere', 'chance', 'coincidence', 'providence', 'protagonist', 'able', 'escape', 'immediate', 'extinction', 'Most', 'movie', 'adrenalin-filled', 'run', 'jungles', 'hopes', 'returning', 'wife', 'son', 'left', 'virtual', 'pit', 'hopelessness', 'despair', 'odds', 'seem', 'insurmountable', 'Wounded', 'exhausted', 'shocked', 'protagonist', 'moves', 'ahead', 'first', 'pure', 'sense', 'instinct', 'then', 'father', 'remembrance', 'feel', 'fear', 'qualities', 'very', 'good', 'luck', 'allow', 'gain', 'advantage', 'relentless', 'scary', 'adversaries', 'Nothing', 'predictable', 'here', 'Advantages', 'soon', 'turn', 'sour', 'only', 'uncanny', 'willpower', 'perseverance', 'protagonist', 'propel', 'capture', 'death', 'spoken', 'native', 'tongue', 'subtitles', 'viewer', 'immersed', 'point', 'unspeakable', 'horror', 'chance', 'endurance', 'film', 'other', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'very', 'powerful', 'movie', 'making', 'best-directed', 'film', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Hollywood', 'circuit', 'go', 'forward', 'explore', 'new', 'unseen', 'dimensions', 'human', 'experience']",N/A

There's an epic jungle out there and the fiercest beast of all is, ah, us!I don't know if Gibson is clinically nuts.  His latest brush's with anti-Semitism and drunkenness were bizarre, but he does show all the characteristics of a wild-eyed-visionary-artist. Apocalypto is a fantastical recreation of a 600 year old Mayan civilization that out-DeMille's any Hollywood historical stuff I've ever seen. Gibson used a ton of his own loot to build a Mayan city so lifelike, it is obviously not computer generated.  The sets reminded me of earlier Gibson projects, a Gibsonionian Mad Max touch.The film begins with a bloody, but good-natured tribal hunt.  Rudy Youngblood soon learns that the city Mayans are out on the prowl looking for slaves. His village is decimated and the villagers are led off to the Gods.  Along the way, he observes the incredible brutality of the Mayan religion.

I'm personally into indigenous living and especially self-sufficient living.The movie is about a small tribe of jungle dwellers in the age of Mayan domination. These people are not part of the 'great' Mayan civilization, they live in isolated freedom. They are self-sufficient jungle-dwellers who take everything they need from the forest, build their own shelter, hunt and forage. This true freedom gets destroyed by the dominating city state, whose servants go to the jungle to collect jungle dwellers to sacrifice to the gods and for slavery.This story is not gonna give you a history lesson on the 'great technological advancements and accomplishments' of the dominating city states. But it sure is a perfectly correct insight into the conflict between, on the one hand, domination, controlled 'empires' and mass ignorance, and on the other hand, autonomous, self-sufficient living off the land.The main character's quest is to save himself from execution and reunite with his young family, but the way I saw it was more than that. A deep, ever relevant conflict between the two worlds and ways of life. And this movie's deeply caring desire to tackle this most important topic of all would almost be enough to call it one of the best ever. But it's also very well presented, thrilling and visually stunning, with an intense yet comfortable attention to detail.The only thing I didn't like was that for some strange reason all these wilderness people were perfectly clean shaven, straight out of a Gillette advert. This may be historically correct, though I struggle to believe that these natural people would find a reason to shave. Other than this minor flaw, I found nothing wrong with the movie.

1005820,A1IZWTVAQVJIFE,B000GNOKQG,Rerevisionist,"[1, 4]","Interesting as an attempt by an independently-minded star to step out and expand. I suspect the marketing department made their mark though - the title is odd; and what does 'No one can outrun their destiny' mean?This is set in Mayan territory in about what's we call 1600. Mel Gibson (who doesn't appear) presides over an explanatory video; he doesn't seem to realise there are many different types of 'jungle', but anyway he found a site he liked, flat enough to film in, with clear areas suited to building a Mayan-style pyramid complex and village. Both the jungle village, and the Mayan mini-town, are quite well realised though (sigh) marginally on the small side. There's another area, apparently for burning lime for mortar.The village is shown as idyllic with many practical jokes. For my taste the ethnic make-up didn't really look right, being mostly heterogeneous extras with brownish make-up. However, the lead Maya baddie had an impressive (prosthetic) beaked nose effect in profile. There's a good tapir hunt at the start, with a sudden-death gadget which slightly reminds me of a thing in 'Badlands'. Maybe it's inevitable, but there were suggestions of other film influences - an un-escapable pit (as in 'Silence of the Lambs'), a leap down a waterfall ('Butch Cassidy'), arrows and spears being tugged out (LotR style). The village life was well done - happy kids, cheerful healthy people, comfort, some communal things, fires, thatch, dancing - and throughout the film the scarification, tattoos, nose and ear jade pieces looked convincing and, like the colours throughout, were supposed to have been researched and accurate, as was the subtitled language. The dancing looked a bit under-choreographed to me, but you can't have everything.But we also have 'the universality of warfare and its oftentimes awesome savagery' and we have a scene with a very similar group, fleeing in dread. The village chief was not interested in asking them why they were fleeing - the forest is his, and fearlessness is right. (Come to think of it, the fleeing group didn't blurt out why - also a bit odd). Anyway - there follows quite a long scene of what looked like a massacre, but turned out to be a roundup of captives. This was slightly like a Vietnam War scene could have been, if filmmakers had independence and courage. It's surprising how easily a film can cause an emotional reaction: one of the overseers taking a group of captives, roped to a long stick, for their long march to town, was a sadistic type. Yeh - fall down the cliff too! The lead kidnapper had his clothing style worked on - there's a sort of Aztec/ Roman feel, plus animal skulls. We have a nod to worrying superstitions - a little girl with awful warnings.Then we have the town. It's well done, with interesting human types. I have to say the top of the pyramid, the rectangular platform, looked a bit small to me, as if an energetic desperate prisoner could have taken quite a few guards rolling down the steps. There are some impressive headpieces for the priests and (I think) the king. We have a sacrifice, complete with beating heart held aloft, removed with an obsidian knife. At this point we have a real stretch: a total eclipse of the sun, just before the hero is about to become heartless. It's not filmed very accurately - a partially-eclipsed sun can't be looked at directly, so there's just a chill and some oddly shaped shadows. Most films get implausible some time earlier. It's made clear that the killings aren't just being nasty. (Or - I thought this was another fact, or factoid - so that the priests could eat young women). The Maya are having problems, and hope a few deaths will appease the Gods.Anyway - the would-be victims are now to be disposed of. We have a pit with bodies, an open area, spears and arrows and stones, a corn field with genuine maize, a lot of running through jungle, and a waterfall. The lead baddy's feebler son - the daddy is obviously a bit disappointed in him - gets himself killed, which emotionally propels the chase of half a dozen Mayans against the remaining villager. We have death by snakebite, death by jaguar, a wasp nest, a poisonous frog blowpipe, and a repeat of the tapir wood stake trap. This is nicely done but not completely convincing: the pit of bodies would surely have been heaving with beetles, carnivores, and birds of prey. And the jungle was almost insect-free...Another stretch here is just related to the distances: I've no real experience running through jungle wearing not much clothing, but probably the town to the forest home might be about twenty miles. So surely they'd have some idea of what was happening... Anyway, there's the waterfall drop scene - a green screen job, surely - which the lead baddy emerges from holding his bow and arrows...A subplot is the hero's wife, and young son, who has a gash stitched with severed any heads, hidden in the well - which was dry, but now fills - we seem to get about 70 inches of rain in a few hours. She also gives birth underwater.And we get to the sea, presumably the Gulf of Mexico.

His tabloid rap means nothing to me when watching his films, as the films of Roman Polanski, Elia Kazan or Leni Riefenstahl. ""Apocalypto"" had me from the first frame, and I thought it was another fine film from a fine director. It's known that the Mayans had gruesome sacrificial rites, far worse than what Mr. Gibson portrayed. Still, brutal and abrasive behavior abounds regarding simple human beings who simply live to survive. Vengeance and escape are the centers of this film about a man who simply wants to go back to his family. Once he thinks everything can be happy, the Europeans arrive...and that's a whole different story.

1005827,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000GNOKQG,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","Apocalypto (Mel Gibson, 2006)So many reviews of this film I've read, both amateur and professional, dwell on the violence. I don't know what other movies these folks are watching. The Passion of the Christ, for one obvious comparison that's just as mainstream, was far, far more violent than this was. There are movies less than half this long that are far more violent. I think the bottom line as far as this goes is that if you have a weak stomach, you might want to avoid Apocalypto, but if you had no problem with The Passion of the Christ (or, honestly, Eastern Promises), then don't let all the shock over the ""extreme"" amount of violence in this movie get to you. If you want to see it, the violence won't bother you.In any case, the story: Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is a warrior and hunter in a small rural tribe. Everything's going along swimmingly until a Mayan slaver band attacks and captures almost the entire tribe. Jaguar Paw is able to send his wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez) and son off to hide in a hole, but the slavers find out about it and cut the vine she's supposed to use to climb out. Thus, Jaguar Paw has to find a way to escape before he's sacrificed and rescue his wife and son before they starve, or die of thirst.Not a bad little revenge thriller, this, and Gibson, as he did with The Passion of the Christ, adds the mystique of a foreign setting and a language far removed from that most people are familiar with. As a gimmick, I'm sure it will grow old eventually, but Gibson is a proven director on ground he's very familiar with. As a result, the film is very effective. The cinematography is gorgeous, unsurprising as Gibson once again pairs with Dean Semler (Dead Calm, The Road Warrior, Razorback), one of those fantastic cinematographers they grow down in Australia. The make-up jobs are gorgeous, and the action sequences are choreographed in such a way that you'd never think they were choreographed. This is good stuff. Gibson turns in another winner; when he's behind the camera, it seems, he can't lose. *** ",4,Good stuff.,1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,2052,"['Apocalypto', 'Mel', 'Gibson', '2006', 'So', 'many', 'reviews', 'film', ""'ve"", 'read', 'amateur', 'professional', 'dwell', 'violence', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'other', 'movies', 'folks', 'are', 'watching', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'one', 'obvious', 'comparison', 'just', 'mainstream', 'was', 'far', 'far', 'more', 'violent', 'was', 'are', 'movies', 'less', 'long', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'violent', 'think', 'bottom', 'line', 'as', 'far', 'have', 'weak', 'stomach', 'might', 'want', 'avoid', 'Apocalypto', 'had', 'problem', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'honestly', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'shock', 'extreme', 'amount', 'violence', 'movie', 'get', 'want', 'see', 'violence', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'you.In', 'case', 'story', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'Rudy', 'Youngblood', 'warrior', 'hunter', 'small', 'rural', 'tribe', 'Everything', 'going', 'along', 'swimmingly', 'Mayan', 'slaver', 'band', 'attacks', 'almost', 'entire', 'tribe', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'able', 'send', 'wife', 'Seven', 'Dalia', 'Hernandez', 'hide', 'hole', 'slavers', 'find', 'out', 'cut', 'vine', 'supposed', 'use', 'climb', 'out', 'Thus', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'find', 'way', 'escape', 'sacrificed', 'rescue', 'wife', 'son', 'starve', 'die', 'thirst.Not', 'bad', 'little', 'revenge', 'thriller', 'Gibson', 'did', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'mystique', 'foreign', 'setting', 'language', 'far', 'removed', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'familiar', 'gimmick', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'grow', 'old', 'eventually', 'Gibson', 'proven', 'director', 'ground', 'very', 'familiar', 'result', 'film', 'very', 'effective', 'cinematography', 'gorgeous', 'unsurprising', 'Gibson', 'once', 'again', 'pairs', 'Dean', 'Semler', 'Dead', 'Calm', 'Road', 'Warrior', 'Razorback', 'one', 'fantastic', 'cinematographers', 'grow', 'down', 'Australia', 'make-up', 'jobs', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'choreographed', 'such', 'way', ""'d"", 'never', 'think', 'were', 'choreographed', 'good', 'stuff', 'Gibson', 'winner', 'when', 'camera', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lose', '***']",N/A
1005828,A23VTC6VKNFZVE,B000GNOKQG,Robert D. Williams,"[0, 0]","Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is a very violent film depicting life in ancient times, C. 1500 CE in the Mayan Empire.  The young man Jaguar Paw, his family and jungle villiage are attacked by savage Mayan slavers looking for suitable captives for ritual sacrifice in their temples.  Jaguar Paw and many in his village are taken captive and the villiage is burned.  Jaguar Paw's wife and child evade capture and are hidden in a deep pit. After a long and grueling journey, the captives are brought to the Mayan city for sacrifice.  Alone, Jaguar Paw Escapes and tries to return to the jungle, but the angry Mayan slavers are in hot pursuit.I thought the film was exciting, unpredictable and extremely violent.  This was probably close to the truth, as even the cruel Spaniards believed the Mayans to be bloodthirsty.  Essential to the theme was how the jungle people lived in comparative harmony and bliss in those ancient times.  Village life seemed like an Eden.The plot of the film reminded me of Conan the Barbarian, with some differences.  Extreme brutality was essential to the theme there as well. Apocalypto was filmed using the original Mayan languages with English subtittles.  To me this was distracting.  Not speaking the ancient Mayan tongue, I found it difficult to follow the action and read the subtittles at the same time.  I would  like to have seen an in English version.

So, I was hoping that the film, with it's use of a Mayan language, a native cast and shot on location in the Yucatan Peninsula, would give me a flavor for the locale. I will say, on that level, the movie succeeds. The cinematography is gorgeous, the performances are good, and you do get somewhat of a sense of what it might be like to live in the ancient Mayan culture.But forget about the controversies around the historical inaccuracies or Gibson himself. When all is said and done, this is just a one dimensional, violent Hollywood action film set in an atypically exotic locale. The setting and language are used in an attempt to make the film seem more substantial than it actually is. The plot is very basic, and there is a fair amount of excitement along the way. As with most action films, there is some silliness, too. (For instance, two characters are endangered by rainfall, but it would have to be raining at about 5 feet an hour - a bit much, even for a rain forest). And, yes indeed, there is really some over the top violence on view. Co-screenwriter Mel spent lots of time coming up with new ways to depict people killing each other. These very graphic scenes are not for the squeamish, to be sure.If Mel has an agenda here, as some claim, it's presented in such a shallow way that's it's impossible to take seriously. It's really too bad, because this really could have been a terrific movie -- there's was so much to work with in this cultural milieu. Unfortunately, that's secondary to the fairly standard action elements. If you can put up with the gore, than what you've got here is an enjoyable live action cartoon thrill ride, but not much more.",2,"Surprisingly enough, very disappointing",1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,1774,"['had', 'very', 'personal', 'reason', 'wanting', 'see', 'film', 'are', 'adopting', 'child', 'Guatemala', 'soon', 'So', 'was', 'hoping', 'film', 'use', 'Mayan', 'language', 'native', 'cast', 'shot', 'location', 'Yucatan', 'Peninsula', 'would', 'give', 'flavor', 'locale', 'will', 'say', 'level', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'gorgeous', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'do', 'get', 'somewhat', 'sense', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'live', 'ancient', 'Mayan', 'culture.But', 'forget', 'controversies', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'Gibson', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'just', 'one', 'dimensional', 'violent', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'film', 'set', 'atypically', 'exotic', 'locale', 'setting', 'language', 'are', 'used', 'attempt', 'make', 'film', 'seem', 'more', 'substantial', 'actually', 'plot', 'very', 'basic', 'fair', 'amount', 'excitement', 'way', 'most', 'action', 'films', 'silliness', 'too', 'instance', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'endangered', 'rainfall', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'raining', '5', 'feet', 'hour', 'bit', 'much', 'even', 'rain', 'forest', 'yes', 'indeed', 'really', 'top', 'violence', 'view', 'Co-screenwriter', 'Mel', 'spent', 'lots', 'time', 'coming', 'up', 'new', 'ways', 'depict', 'people', 'killing', 'other', 'very', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'squeamish', 'be', 'sure.If', 'Mel', 'agenda', 'here', 'claim', 'presented', 'such', 'shallow', 'way', 'impossible', 'take', 'seriously', 'really', 'too', 'bad', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'terrific', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'work', 'cultural', 'milieu', 'Unfortunately', 'secondary', 'fairly', 'standard', 'action', 'elements', 'can', 'put', 'up', 'gore', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'here', 'enjoyable', 'live', 'action', 'cartoon', 'thrill', 'ride', 'not', 'much', 'more']",N/A

Gibson's people made a successful effort at demonstrating a civilization totally alien from our own.  I loved the strange women, almost aliens from outer space.  I also like the slave raid.  For thousands of years inhabitants of the Americas experienced similar raids by war parties from the ""civilized"" nations on the continent.The slaving scene, for those who wish to look ""under the covers"", is the history of civilization in general.  Up until only a couple of centuries ago, slavery was simply a given and was not regarded as wrong.  The difference in MesoAmerica was that many of the captives, rather than being used for slave labor, went to fattening pens and to heart sacrifice.I liked the relationship between the slave captain and his son when he tells him after the successful slave capture.  ""Your doing a great job, boy.  I'm proud of you.""  Wonderful, really, and all so very human.  The final scene was great.  The warring Indians look out to sea and watch strange men with helmets and breastplates rowing into shore.  It's the Apocalypse.  The world WILL change.  Ironically, this film ends up almost exactly where my two novels--""Skull Rack"" and ""Hummingbird God""--start...the glorious, terrible Conquest of Mexico.I thought the chase scene, although exciting, was a little too much ""Last of the Mohicans.""

While the gore and violence are likely no worse than any modern slasher movie they are plentiful enough.  Only unlike Freddie and his kind, the brutality in Apocalypto is probably realistic of the time the movie is set in, and it makes sense in that context.The movie is thought-provoking.  Maybe there's a chronological mismatch between the Mayan empire and the Spaniards' arrival, but it's intriguing to think of such a cruel people about to get their comeuppance, and how the mighty keep falling.  In real life the Spaniards had such huge success against the Aztecs precisely because of the latter's rampant savagery and tyranny against other indigenous peoples.  Like the Russians who greeted the conquering Nazis in WWII as liberators only to find them as bad as the Soviets, so will the people in Apocalypto find the Spaniards in due time.  This is foreshadowed by Jaguar Paw's (the movie's protagonist)decision at the end to not meet these strange new people but to fade into the jungle.There's action galore here and a rather standard plot.  Paw's pa teaches a lesson in fearlessness and then must act it out when taken prisoner.  Their bucolic jungle village, which specializes in tormenting one of its  hunters who seems unable to father a child, is overrun by a vicious Mayan brigade which takes prisoners for slavery and sacrifice.  Paw, who will have none of it because he means to save his family which he hid in a vertical cave, escapes and is hunted.  Rambo-like he manages to dispatch his followers one by one until, with determined look in his eyes, he gets revenge on the two Mayans who most had it in for him.But the spectacular filming and effects of this movie set it apart from the usual Hollywood ho-hum.  I think it also works having the characters speak some exotic tongue, although I wonder: is there really a Mayan dialect word for the F-Bomb?  Kids, don't repeat this Mayan word in the Yucatan.  You could get slapped.Wikipedia says ""Apocalypto"" means to discover, or reveal.  (And thus the Bible's Apocalypse.)  But exactly what was director Mel Gibson meaning to show us?  That, as he quotes Will Durant at the beginning, empires rot away before they fall away, or that there's always a tougher tyrant on the block, or that the Mayans had it all: brains, beauty, and brutality?  I'm not sure.

Although I have had an oportunity to visit the pyramids in Mexico and Central America and have seen Discovery and History channels specials on Mayas and Aztecs I was always relatively disturbed that the TV specials had a lot of PC (political correctness) control over the production.Apocalyptico is an in your face depiction of the exteremely advance, intelligent and perverted bloodthirsty societies that both the Aztecs and the Mayans really were in their day. If I had any slight disappointment it would be that the city depicted in the movie, the temples, residences and most of all the pyramids were much much smaller than real life. I would guess that they couldn't film in some of the larger well known historical sites and had to build the set themselves. It does not take away from the movie but I only make this comment to emphasize the real horror of the Mayan history.This movie is so violent it's pornographic. The sexual abuse of the women is glossed over in this film, also to it's detriment cause I would guess Gibson probably thought enough with the violence that he will have to deal with never mind any explicit rapes etc.....[...]If you want to understand this culture then read 'Aztec Summer' by Gary Jennings, (not Aztec Bllod by the same author  ... the book is a dog). This is a novel with the most fabulously and for the most part historically correct depiction of the Aztecs, and of course to the same extent the Maya and their bloothirsty rituals.To give you an understanding, as you watch the sacrifices at the Mayan temple in this movie, the Aztecs did the same sacrifices when they conquered warring armies that they actually were killing people 24 hours a day for periods of more than 10 years!Finally, for those of us that have visual memories, the chase and the hunt does not diminish the impression of the sacrifices.

The story revolves around a young hunter, Jaguar Paw, and his pregnant wife and young son, who live in a small village within the Mayan empire. If you have read the books by Jared Diamond (Collapse; Guns, Germs, and Steel), you'd have a good idea of the Mayan Civilization and its impact on its environment and subjects. I highly recommend you read both books.Jaguar Paw is captured by Mayan soldiers and is taken to the great Mayan city, where, along with his captured companions, is to be offered as sacrifice to the gods. Meanwhile, his wife and son are stuck in a well, where they hid from the invading Mayan soldiers, and if no one rescues them soon, they will die. To make matters worse, it starts raining heavily, and the well quickly fills up with water, putting the wife and son at risk of drowning. To complicate things further, the wife goes into labor while immersed in water up to her neck, with her young son on her shoulders. She eventually gives birth, and the newborn baby suddenly emerges from the water. The expression on the young boy's face upon seeing his baby brother is beyond words. This is the most memorable scene in the movie and one that will stay with you for a long time. It is rare to have Hollywood portray scenes with such strong emotions. Watch the movie and you'll see what I mean.Will Jaguar Paw be able to rescue his family before they drown? Will he be able to rescue himself? His head is on the altar ready to be beheaded as offering to the gods. What could possibly happen to save him, and in turn, save his family?This is a movie you have to watch.

The cinematography is stunning, sumptuous!!(The giant falling and forever bouncing dead tree was one incredible scene.) I guess what put me off was the idea of SUB TITLES!!Please Mr. Gibson, the audience is smart enough to know that even though the characters are very foreign and from an ancient time, we would know they were authentic even though they spoke English. I HATE TO READ A MOVIE!! Books are to be read, movies are to be WATCHED! With all the action and scenery, you have to read fast then try to take in the fantastic cinematography. Plus Gibson chose actors who actually had interesting FACES! The only weak spot was the animatronic animals. They were really chinzy and non-realistic. I believe a person in an animal suit would have worked better.The story was mesmerizing and once it took off you're not moving from your chair until this roller-coaster ride is over! It's a great old cliff-hanger story, the hero getting into one harrowing problem, getting out, then falling into an even worse one. You are literally biting your nails. It's kind of like the old 40's Henry Fonda movie where he must run for several days and nights to escape a gang of Mohicans or Mohawk Indians who are hell-bent on capturing him. Only the reality of saving a spouse in peril keeps them going.Jaguar Paw proved that brains and cleverness would win out over the sheer thugery of his pursuers.

Men from an isolated tribe are out on a hunt, bantering with each other as they track and kill their game.  One character that stands out is Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead), an elder and father to young Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood).  Their peaceful, homey village is shattered early the next morning when raiders arrive, to burn, pillage, and destroy the village while taking captives.Young Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and young son down a deep sink-hole before battling and succumbing to the raiders.  Men and women alike are strapped to poles and herded through the jungle like livestock, into the vast Mayan city.  Along the way a young girl shouts out prophesies to the raiders, of a dark day and a jaguar.The city is truly a cinematograph wonder.  There are scenes depicting the slaves that built the Mayan pyramids, slave markets, merchants, vendors, and of course the high religious pyramid where the rulers lounge in luxury watching the sacrifices to the Gods.  Jaguar Paw escapes becoming a sacrifice by a solar eclipse.  But the Mayans still intend to make sport of him and his fellow villagers.  When Jaguar Paw manages to escape, the movie gives a chase scene not soon to be forgotten.  Jaguar Paw needs to make it back to his wife and son before the rains start, and with a pack of raiders on his tail, the going is tough.Many other movies are bloodier while depicting less implied violence.  The violence implied in 'Apocalypto' by the Mayan ceremonies is brutal.  There are a couple of 'dig the heart out of the chest' scenes, plus one Tarantino-Style blood spurting scene, but overall the gore was controlled in measure to the violence.  Also, many modern movies employ chase scene just as intense as Jaguar Paw's flight from the raiders, but the atmosphere of Mayan culture and the primitive weapons and fighting techniques make this chase scene unique.The photography is stunning, and the actors, while unknowns, are remarkable.  The entire movie is spoken in Mayan and subtitled in English (you can also choose French or Spanish), but even if you aren't fond of subtitles you should still check out the movie, the action outweighs the dialogue.  This is a visually beautiful movie with plenty of plot and action, though the plot is an old one the presentation is new.  A solid 4.5 stars.

1005847,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000GNOKQG,Scott Schiefelbein,"[1, 1]","""Apocalypto"" is an easier movie to admire than it is to love.  Mel Gibson utilizes all the tricks of his trade to make an intelligent, thoughtful movie and yet what sticks with you is the over-the-top, unrelenting violence of the film.Set in the 16th century, ""Apocalypto"" focuses on the ancient Mayan civilization, one of the most fascinating yet ignored cultures in the Western hemisphere.  Jaguar Paw is a young warrior in a jungle tribe of Maya, father to a young boy and waiting for his pregnant wife to bring another son into the world.  The first half-hour of the film focuses on the daily life of Jaguar Paw's tribe, including a realistic tapir hunt and some hilarious scenes from the tribe's daily life.  One of the most refreshing aspects of ""Apocalypto"" is the movie's willingness to humanize the members of this largely-forgotten culture.The peaceful idyll of the tribe's life comes crashing down after warriors invade the peaceful village looking for slaves.  Men are either killed or taken prisoner, women are raped and then either murdered or taken prisoner, and children are abandoned to their fate.  Jaguar Paw hides his pregnant wife and young son in a nearby pit, but their lifeline is cut by one of the invaders.  As Jaguar Paw and his fellow villagers are marched away in bondage, he vows to return and save his small family.What ensues is a slow march to hell.  The slavers trek through jungle, across mountains, ford mighty rivers, and eventually end up at a massive Mayan city.  Gibson and his team create a nightmare city of wondrous architecture build on the blood of slaves.  This is not the ""Gone With the Wind"" vision of slavery, with noble slaves toiling more or less willingly on gorgeous pastureland.  ""Apocalypto"" shows slavery in all its horrors, up close and visceral.For all the city's might, the Mayan city suffers.  Disease and blight plague the city, and the rulers are trying to appease their sun-god with human sacrifices . . . which is the destiny of Jaguar Paw and his friends.  Gibson and his team linger on the morbid scene that is this sacrifice - ritual disembowelment following by ripping out of the beating heart of the victim, followed by decapitation.  While this is a scene of undeniable power, feel free to keep a napkin handy for the retching that may ensue.A solar eclipse temporarily saves Jaguar Paw's life and provides him the opportunity to escape back to save his family.  ""Apocalypto"" then turns into a long chase scene as the slavers hunt Jaguar Paw.  Again, these scenes are beautiful and powerful in their way, but again the unrelenting violence becomes a bit much as the body count continues to rise in various gruesome ways.The climax of ""Apocalypto"" is complex and unsettling.  Jaguar Paw may (or may not) win out in the end, but don't look for an equivalent of Luke Skywalker blowing up the Death Star here.

1005848,ANF5BP1SD3Z3O,B000GNOKQG,"Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix 01","[11, 19]","This was a technically accomplished film.  Mel Gibson used a great cinematographer and he knows how to pace a story.  The film and the effects felt real.  The gore looked real enough that I almost lost my dinner. If you are planning to watch this on a date night after having a meal beware unless you are a coroner, policeman or in some other profession where you see a lot of blood this may turn your stomach.The main character Jaguar Paw is likeable the Mayans are shown as one dimensional brutal savages who capture victims to use in mass ritual sacrifice.Plot SummaryJaguar Paw (possibly taken from the monument of a ruler in ancient Tikal Great Jaguar Claw) is a hunter and after an encounter with the Maya while hunting a tapir he has a nightmare.  The next day the Maya burn his village and try to capture the inhabitants.  Jaguar Paw rescues his pregnant wife and son and hides them in a cave.  He is eventually captured by the Maya led by Zero Wolf who takes him to a Maya city where he witness horrible atrocities including mass human sacrifice.The victims are held down their hearts cut out while still alive then decapitated the audience is shown this ritual in great gory detail, not for the squeamish.  Eventually, Jaguar Paw escapes then leads the Maya on a merry chase; he manages to get out of Maya territory and back to his homeland.  During his escape and evasion of the Maya Jaguar Paw encounters Spanish explorers and missionaries.Historic Accuracy; for the sake of time I am only focusing on the big glaring errors.General Errors -Maya and their neighbors were farmers not hunters; so it was unlikely Jaguar Paw and his people were hunters.Maya civilization was well known and they traded with others.  If Jaguar Paw had been portrayed accurately he would have been a farmer who had been to a city to trade or worship.There was warfare and terror toward the end of Mayan civilization for about 100 years; however it was between rival nobles and their city states.  During this period of war the terror started when rivals began murdering women and children of the enemy not just warriors and nobles.  The film depicts the main conflict as cities vs. non Maya hunter gather villagers, just not accurate.  This period in Maya history has only come to light since Maya hieroglyphics have been decoded so it is not something that Europeans would have known.The Europeans arrived 300 - 400 years after the end of Maya civilization- so our hero could not have encountered the Spanish; by the time the Spanish arrived the Maya civilization was gone and the cities overgrown by the jungle.Depiction of Maya Rituals -In the movie the peaceful hunter gatherer villagers were surprised and captured for the purpose of sacrifice.  According to archeologists and historians the Maya only sacrificed warriors and nobles captured as a result of war.  Since war for the Maya probably had both religious and practical aspects it did not make sense for them to attack defenseless villagers with little resources.The ritual of sacrifice that they showed where the captives had their hearts cut out and were decapitated on a large scale is actually a depiction of an Aztec ritual not a Maya ritual.  So if the Maya did not practice mass sacrifice like the Aztecs then why would they need to capture villagers?The Maya commonly practiced bloodletting, men would commonly perforate the foreskin of the [...] and women would slit their tongues and pull ropes through them; this was done because blood was used in many rituals and religious observances to nourish the gods and the spiritual world.  This was curiously absent from the film I guess accuracy was not as important as showing something exciting and scary so they decided to use the Aztec Ritual.Some concluding thoughts -This is about as historically accurate as someone 500 years in the future making a film about baseball and the 2006 wold series.  The director decidies to show the players wearing Football gear and tackling each other because it is more dramatic even though that was not done in baseball or the world series.  Then the director to sell the movie goes out and tells the potential audience that he had a baseball expert consult on the film therefore his film is a true representation of the game.  It might be a good story, but history?If you want a graphically violent, visually sunning and exciting chase film set in an exotic setting then Apocalapto is a good choice; just be aware that the violence is very graphic if you choose to see this on a date I would suggest skipping dinner.Although Mel Gibson claims that this is an accurate depiction of the Maya and says he consulted an archeologist the film truly reflects a poor knowledge of the Maya.  Apocalypto is a good piece of fiction but no hollywood story is as rich as books on Mayan culture written by Linda Schele and David Friedel, or a visit to a museum or a national geographic documentary like Lost Kingdoms of the Maya (1993).  Apocalypto is to Mayan archeology and anthropology what the DaVinci Code is to Religious Studies and Art History; a movie that generates controversey but should not be confused for fact.",2,Entertaining but historically inaccurate,1179273600,"05 16, 2007",2007,5160,"['was', 'technically', 'accomplished', 'film', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'used', 'great', 'cinematographer', 'how', 'pace',

1005850,A1FCWRSICTO2AH,B000GNOKQG,S. Harris,"[4, 8]","To be honest, I thought Apocalypto had all the makings of a new Heaven's Gate. Obsessed director, gimmicky idea regarding a lost culture and scripted in another dead language (see Passion of the Christ).  Boy, was I wrong.  Apocalypto, with its Lost World setting, is, if you just look at the plot, a lean and mean action film.  If you've ever seen the old Cornel Wilde flick, Naked Prey, you essentially have a good chunk of Apocalypto, as the hero, Jaguar Paw, races through the jungle, pursued by Mayans, while at home, his wife and child are in great, and growing, danger.  It's edge of your seat suspense that never lets up.  But on another level, Gibson has something to say about civilizations and how they kill themselves. The Mayan's are about as decadent and pagan (in a bad way) as it gets. There were times, as you were led through the Mayan city, that I thought this could be Mars.  It is unsettling and it is brutal, right down to the colors and clothing of the Mayans.  If a civilization can become demonic, certainly this one, as portrayed by Gibson, was.  The sacrifice scenes could easily come out of the Old Testament, the god being worshipped: Baal. And underscoring that is a little girl's prophet-like condemnation, that upsets the Mayan soldiers.  They themselves sense something is in the air, a bad moon is on the rise.  Spiraling out from this is a landscape that is denuded by poor usage, while plague gnaws at the edges of the Mayan world.  Yes, it is a movie set in the past, but one can't help thinking that Gibson is projecting this vision on the here and now.  It's a short leap from a world where heads are being tossed down temple steps, to one where beheadings can be viewed on the internet.",5,His best movie,1180137600,"05 26, 2007",2007,1726,"['be', 'honest', 'thought', 'Apocalypto', 'had', 'makings', 'new', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'Obsessed', 'director', 'gimmicky', 'idea', 'regarding', 'lost', 'culture', 'scripted', 'dead', 'language', 'see', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'Boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'Apocalypto', 'Lost', 'World', 'setting', 'just', 'look', 'plot', 'lean', 'mean', 'action', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'old', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'flick', 'Naked', 'Prey', 'essentially', 'have', 'good', 'chunk', 'Apocalypto', 'hero', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'jungle', 'pursued', 'Mayans', 'home', 'wife', 'child', 'are', 'great', 'growing', 'danger', 'edge', 'seat', 'suspense', 'never', 'up', 'level', 'Gibson', 'something', 'say', 'civilizations', 'how', 'kill', 'Mayan', 'are', 'decadent', 'pagan', 'bad', 'way', 'were', 'times', 'were', 'led', 'Mayan', 'city', 'thought', 'could', 'be', 'Mars', 'unsettling', 'brutal', 'right', 'down', 'colors', 'clothing', 'Mayans', 'civilization', 'can', 'become', 'demonic', 'certainly', 'one', 'portrayed', 'Gibson', 'was', 'sacrifice', 'scenes', 'could', 'easily', 'come', 'Old', 'Testament', 'god', 'being', 'worshipped', 'Baal', 'underscoring', 'little', 'girl', 'prophet-like', 'condemnation', 'Mayan', 'soldiers', 'sense', 'something', 'air', 'bad', 'moon', 'rise', 'Spiraling', 'out', 'landscape', 'denuded', 'poor', 'usage', 'plague', 'gnaws', 'edges', 'Mayan', 'world', 'Yes', 'movie', 'set', 'past', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'Gibson', 'projecting', 'vision', 'here', 'now', 'short', 'leap', 'world', 'where', 'heads', 'are', 'being', 'tossed', 'down', 'temple', 'steps', 'one', 'where', 'beheadings', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'internet']",N/A

But don't expect a History lesson here, folks. Do expect an action movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.Apocolypto is thoroughly entertaining from start to finish, and not a word of English is spoken throughout. There are subtitles, but I don't think that there is a scene in the movie where you wouldn't be able to figure out what was going on if there were no subtitles at all.Apocolypto tells the story of the approximate 48 hour period of when one Maya tribe clashes with another, and focuses on the effects of the clash on tribe-member Jaguar Paw and his family. The movie hits on all emotions, and is brutally violent at times.The key to viewing Apocolypto is to remember that the idea here was not, as I said earlier, to give the viewer a History lesson. The film takes a fictional, isolated, 2-day period out of Maya civilization and makes an awesome movie out of it. So the critics who were screaming ""historical inaccuracies"" and ""racism"" need to relax.At the time of the film's release there were some negative reviews that said Apocolypto portrayed native Mesoamericans as savages, but never covered and explained the achievements by the Maya culture in art, architecture, language, math and astronomy. Well, no, Apocolypto indeed does not really cover that stuff in detail....It's an action movie, not a documentary!Writer/producer Farhad Safinia (who met Gibson while working on The PassionThe Passion of the Christ (Definitive Edition)) said in a Reuters article from December 2006 that the idea of Apocolypto was ""to update the chase genre by not updating it with technology or machinery but stripping it down to its most intense form, which is a man running for his life."" And that is what you get....Apocolypto is a kind-of Maya civilization First BloodFirst Blood(1982) story that takes place in the jungles of the Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula circa 1517.Welcome to the jungle.

1005862,ANDN1ZKBHC0K3,B000GNOKQG,Stephen Lai,"[4, 8]","Why am I saying this, even when seeing so many controversial and negative critics about this movie and Mel Gibson himself lately? Well, to be honest, this is not a movie for everyone. Especially for those who can't bear extremely violent scenes in the cinema. It is rated ""R"" in US and the equivalence in most countries. The movie is even banned in Mainland China. However, if you take the violence element apart, this is by all means an inspiring and thought-provoking piece of work. After all, the killing & brutality shown in the movies are no pretentious Hollywood movie acts, but only to reflect the primitive nature of the then Mayan civilization, the cruelty of human species and the struggles for survival. Some may argue if Mel Gibson has a predilection for unrelenting violence in all his directing movies (Braveheart, Passion of Chirst, Apocalypto) - even though they are in different contexts. Well, it may just be coincidence - I don't know!I have no knowledge of the historicity of the story, but it sets out in a 15th century pre-European-invaded Maya village in South America. The movie began with a tapir hunting scene of the tribal warriors, followed with scenes of simple, peaceful and harmonious tribal village lives. Then came with the thrilling parts of the movie with the attack of the village by another savage tribe, the killing and the tortures of the captured, the human sacrifices, and the chases. With his home village destroyed, children abducted, and fellow residents slaughtered and captured by the brutal tribes in demands for slaves and human sacrifices, brave warrior Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) had his twisted fate and struggled to escape from the chase of the villains.There are several shocking scenes in the movie, which were crafted with unique scriptwriting and surprisingly good acting. I would say many of these are quite original that you see it first time in the modern day Hollywood movies. Many will particularly feel sensational and emotional to see the human sacrifices, the near-death chasing sequences, and the struggling for survival of Jaguar Paw's pregnant wife with the baby labored in the flooding well while protecting another child of her from drowning. You see the strong wills of humans fighting for survival in helpless spaces, yet when facing the final moment of death, they bear no fear and are submissive to the choice of the nature and God's will.The movie also has excellent cinematography and directing. I suppose Mel Gibson is having too many enemies in Hollywood, otherwise I think this movie deserves more acclaims. Similar to ""Passion of Christ"", Mel Gibson proves once again that a movie can be great without understanding the spoken language (in this case, the Maya language), but just by reading the subtitles, or by the sheer images and sound.I barely remember the movie started with a Will Durant quote, saying ""A civilization cannot be conquered without from within"". Very true indeed. When looking at the human civilization today, we human species are still killing other people for our own good and for our selfish desires, albeit in more civilized manners. But after all, we could still be cold-blooded, savage and brutal. Wars, Poverty, Global Warming - all inflicted by our civilization. Who is to be conquered?

I want to focus on the quality of the encode instead.For a short review of the film, I will say that it is action packed and nicely done, though I found the story slightly sparse; like the action took precedence over story.It's also pretty violent in places, which is fine by me, but may not be everyone's cup of tea.As far as the disc is concerned, the Blu-Ray presentation is phenomenal.For video encoding Buena Vista chose to use the AVC/MPEG4 format. The encode is what you'd expect from HD; crisp and clear. There are no compression issues or any other perceptible visual anomalies present. It just looks darn good! The only real issue is the use of different film stocks. What you have is more grain in some areas due to the use of certain film stocks, while in others you have crisp clarity. This is as the movie is supposed to be presented, but if you don't realize why the change in ""quality"" it can be a bit confusing.As far as audio is concerned, I commend Mel Gibson for his use of authentic languages on his films. The LPCM 5.1 audio (uncompressed) is absolutely clear and problem free. The channels have good separation when needed and it works really well in the Mayan language. There is also a more compatible Dolby Digital 5.1 track, listed as English, though this is not the case. There is only the Mayan language available on this release; no English language dub. You have to watch with subtitles, so if subtitles aren't your thing, look elsewhere.Extras are presented in standard DVD resolution (480p). This is somewhat disappointing, but my guess is that the footage was shot on digital and not digital HD equipment. Hopefully in the future companies will record things in HD and present the entire package, not just the film, in HD.

Gibson has the same, but substitutes the helicopter for a man racing across the screen in pursuit of a tapir. Gibson's new film has a lot in common with Coppola's, but Mel makes it even harder for the viewer to watch: his movie is in the ancient Mayan language. The director takes his sweet time shooting endless-but-beautiful shots of vegetation and, like the movies of those two auteurs, Apocalypto's plot is small, but everything surrounding it is on a massive, grandiose scale. The story follows Jaguar Paw (Youngblood), a hunter living a happy life deep in the jungle. After a warring tribe decimates his village and drags him back to their city to be offered to the Mayan gods as a sacrifice, he escapes and takes the fight to his captors. With Gibson's recent blatant Christian motives, Apocalypto's Christ allegories are thankfully kept to a minimum; but religion and its influence on civilization do play a massive part throughout.

Make no mistake this is a powerful film by a craftsman-shaman of the film world.The film is preceded by recalling the opening quote to the film(""A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within""),written about the Roman Empire.Gibson is making a parallel point with our own civilization: environmental degradation, excessive consumption and political corruption.The ending is inspired and more hopeful than it seems.This is about one man's quest,Jaguar Paw(Rudy Youngblood),to save that which matters most to him in a world on the brink of destruction.After leading a bucolic existence in the forest Mayan tribespeople are captured by aggressive invaders and bound together,taken to a Mayan city,to be sacrificed to the sungod to invoke fertility. Jaguar Paw has to overcome his fear through an adrenaline-soaked heart-racing dash through the jungle.Violence is endemic to this world-rape,pillage.slaughter,sacrifice-and although it is gory,blood is seen pumping out of a head wound,a man's face ravaged by a jaguar,an arrow going through a man's jaw,a ditch of exposed headless bodies(shades of the Holocaust?),a lot is left to the imagination e.g. when the priest's sacrificial knife goes into the body we don't see it going in or the heart at the moment when it's pulled out. The violence was credible in the story of warring tribes.We see live animals like tapirs and jaguars being killed (but only using dummies).Gibson's real message comesfrom the mouth of the shamanic storyteller about man ravaging the earth.The secret of the Apocalypto's visual appeal is a relentless motion of the story and the hero,camera tracking him and his pursuers in every scene.Semler does the cinematograhy,emphasising speed and fluidity and using long takes.The Mayan houses were exactly like you would expect to see:corn husks,pottery sherds,feathers and textiles, baskets and mats.Many of the architectural details are correct,but cobbled together from different localities and eras.Experts think much of the movie could be set during the 9th century,but by the end it seems to be the 15th century. Also inaccurate,the slaughterhouse of sacrifices is closer to the Tolmec-Aztec cultures. Mr. Gibson's direction is clear and crisp and he knows how to involve an audience, taking them on a breathtaking roller coaster ride chock full of spills and thrills.I was hugely entertained and could not remember enjoying a film as much in recent years.

Mel Gibson manages to recreate the world of the Ancient Mayans to such a degree of believability that it makes me anxious to see what he comes up with next. The movie is very simple in its story (it's basically a capture, escape and pursuit chase film) but is so intense that it just keeps you glued to the screen, watching and waiting to see how the next display of human brutality will top the next. And boy, is this movie violent. I don't consider it gratuitous though, simply because the times depicted in the film were just as violent, if not more so. The violence in this film gives an immediacy to the film and makes the threat more real. Make no bones about it, this movie is a rough ride but somehow manages to be uplifting at the same time.The DVD is presented in fantastic picture quality and the DTS 5.1 mix is absolutely fantastic as well, filling the room with the lush sounds of the jungle from every direction. My only wish is that the DVD had a more concise making-of feature but all that is presented here is a rather short featurette that touches on several facets of the production but not in as much detail as I would've liked. It's okay to watch but I think a nice two hour documentary (at least two!) would've been a great way to detail what was obviously a lot of hard work and research on the part of the filmmakers. There is also a commentary by Gibson and the co-screenwriter of the film which is informative and rife with Gibson's kooky humor.This is a great film which is very simple but still a stunning visual treat and human drama that I really enjoyed.

However, I will say that I thought ""Apocalypto"" was driven, at least in part, by William Golding's ""Lord of the Flies"", all the way up to the film's ending.""Apolcalypto"" was a film that pretty much delivered what I expected it to deliver. There is brutality and gore in the film, but those were minor aspects of the story, which starts slowly but unfolds at an increasingly rapid pace.It would have been great if the Mayans were more modern in their approach to finding ways of resolving the problems that led to the death of their civilization, but, simply stated, they weren't.  Human civilization has a long history of cultures and movements borne of violence, from the distant past all the way up to the present day.  If brutality was the norm regarding certain aspects of Mayan culture, it would not have been the first in the history of humanity. It's something that I don't think Mel Gibson needs to be apologetic about. After all, the Mayan pryamids were probably not erected by unionized workers.Is this a historically accurate film? I don't know. I wasn't there... were you?  While I don't even come close to holding a doctorate in Mayan Culture, I would have to imagine that ""Apolcalypto"" was to some degree, approximately accurate.Gibson attempted to illustrate the problems which confronted the peoples of a primitive culture, and he was successful, which is what was important, anyway.  After all, very few films based on history don't fail to take poetic license when it come to dealing with how things actually were, versus our perception of how things were.  The list of examples, which would contain the names of many great films, is too numerous to mention.""Apocalypto"" is not something for your wife and kids to watch while consuming quantities of butter popcorn and five-buck soft drinks; It is not family fare.  It's also not a ""Dinner and a Movie"" fare either.  If you take a date to see this film, you'd better be sure that your partner wasn't a regular viewer of ""Sex and the City"", because I guarantee you, it's an unworkable combination.Any film or play worth watching contains conflict of some sort. ""King Lear"" and ""MacBeth"" portrayed the very human traits of brutality and evil. Neither was about a protagonist who has feelings he or she can't resolve, which without any action being taken, are somehow resolved at the end of the story.  For that reason, I hate modern television.  Shows like ""24"", ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Desperate Housewives"" are garbage soap operas. I'd rather watch reruns of ""Green Acres"", but that's another story.""Apocalypto"" is a great film in terms of cinematography.  There was, generally, a lot to think about during the film's 138 minutes.  Overall, I thought it was a very good film, but not a great film on the order of ""A Man for All Seasons"", or ""Lawrence of Arabia"".  Still, I gave it five stars for effort and for technique.If you saw this film and didn't like it, all I can say is that the next time you go see a film or rent a dvd, you might want to pay attention to the film's reviews, read any plot synopsis available and especially pay attention to which demographic group to which the product is being marketed.

Thankfully, it doesn't get as gruesome as in a lot of modern slasher films, but there is still so much violence in this movie that the intensity of it almost doesn't matter, at least to me.  But even still, the point is that it isn't meant to be glorified--we're supposed to respond with horror and disgust, and we do.  Still, with so much of it there is the very real possibility of audiences reacting the wrong way, either to become desensitized to it or even to relish it.

In fact, if it is a problem it's only because in many other ways this film is very realistic: aside from not whitewashing violence, the film is entirely in the Yucatec Maya language, with no option for watching it in English or any other Indo-European language.  Hence there might be some inconsistency here: perhaps a better approach would have been to go the ""Road to El Dorado"" in having fictitious ""Mayincatecs"" who don't represent any one specific civilization but combine elements of Maya, Inca, and Aztec.  That's probably the closest thing to a flaw other than the violence here.But in any case, the point is that this could be any civilization we're looking at, it need not be so specific.  It could even be our own--and that's probably Mr. Gibson's point in making this film the way he did.  We in the United States of America practice human sacrifice all the time, only we don't call it that.  Instead of calling it sacrifice to Kukulkan, we call it ""right to choose"".  Abortion, euthanasia, destruction of embryonic people for stem cells, etc.  Call it what you will, it doesn't change the savagery of what it truly is: I have seen images of aborted babies and it made me want to cry, and it was hard not thinking of that as I watched grown men have their hearts ripped out, their heads chopped off, and then the heads (followed by the bodies) tossed down the steps of the pyramid like garbage, all to the cheers of the people.We still (rightly) get upset when we see tragedies like the ""Dark Knight"" shootings or the Boston marathon bombings, but if you don't know the real root cause of such abominations, you are not equipped to fix them.  If you don't know that the reason such things happen is because the people who do them were brought up not to respect human life as sacred, then you are not equipped to do something to change your culture to respect human life again, and so you are forced to look elsewhere for the problem--like ""gun control"".  I don't like guns personally but they are not the problem: evil didn't arise because guns were invented, guns were invented because evil exists.  If everyone respected human life everyone could have a gun and there would be minimal killings.  Take away guns and people can still kill with knives, clubs, even punching, kicking, or biting.  Are we going to chop off everyone's hands and feet and rip out their teeth so they cannot possibly harm anyone?  I don't say that ""gun control"" will necessarily lead to this, only that it makes about as much sense.  We're not babies who need to be prevented from doing harm--we are grownups who need to know what's right and what's wrong, and the consequences for both.  And it starts with our children--how hard is it for children growing up in a society that sees them as unwanted burdens?  Especially when they have to carry that knowledge with them for the rest of their lives?This is as literal as it gets in terms of a civilization destroying itself: self-genocide, institutionalized killings of its own people.  Eugenics contributes as well: sterilizations, contraception, abortifacient drugs, sex that has no chance of resulting in reproduction or that is prevented from it.  We called it evil when the Nazis forced it on people, but we don't call it that when we do the same thing because here we're told it's our ""choice"".  As if force were the only thing that made an action evil where the exact same action would be ""good"" if someone chose to do it.  (I think those responsible for shootings and bombings chose to do what they did, so where is the logical consistency there?)  Worse, contraceptive sex is given positive euphemisms like ""protection"", ""birth control"", ""safe sex"", as if it were responsible instead of just the opposite: Orwellian newspeak in its most blatant form.But here's the thing: this is only a worst-case scenario for a much more prevalent phenomenon that many of us are probably guilty of and we may not even know it, and Father Robert Barron mentioned it in his youtube review of this film: the ""scapegoat"" mentality.  We don't like to admit when we've done wrong, so rather than take responsibility for our actions, or act to actually do something to fix the problems in our society, we instead look for a ""scapegoat"", to play the ""blame game"".  We say ""if only these people would stop what they're doing, if only they would leave the country, if only this, if only that--then things wouldn't be so terrible.""  We see this all the time in political propaganda that passes for ""news"": MSNBC, FoxNews.  It seems sometimes like the only purpose is to vilify the opposite end of the political spectrum as often as possible, to figuratively ""crucify"" them.  At best we see ""them"" being made fun of, as if ""they"" aren't really people with experiences, families, and feelings and desires, but are only present to make us laugh at how stupid or crazy or hypocritical they are--at worst we see ""them"" as evil, from the Devil, a plague on society that must be gotten rid of.Jesus said ""You have heard that it was said to those of old, `You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.'  But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment.""  (Matthew 5:21-22)Wrath weakens us because it makes enemies, demons, subhuman beasts, of human beings whom we ought to see as friends, as brothers, whom we ought to love--only love makes us strong.  If we give ourselves over to uncharitable thoughts, words, and deeds, we let in the Devil.********SPOILER ALERT********Hence why there are Spaniards at the end, including holy men (one is holding a Cross), because when this kind of evil becomes innate to a culture, that culture is in desperate need of Baptism lest it go extinct.  Keep the good, get rid of the evil--give it a spiritual bath, so to speak.  Don't throw out the baby with the bathwater--but throw out the bathwater lest it make the baby sick from the germs.  The point is that Jesus inverted the whole concept behind human sacrifice: human sacrifice is offensive to God, and so Jesus took all the evil and suffering and death of the world upon Himself on the Cross to take it away, and allow us the grace to be good, to be strong against suffering, and to be resurrected to eternal life, as He was.  God made us all and loves us all, so only when we are strong, loving God and neighbor, can we receive God's gift to us.********END SPOILER ALERT********It isn't too late for us to start over.  We have to remember that every human life that is conceived is one that God allowed to be conceived, and He allowed it because He wanted that person to exist--that is a worthwhile person with something to contribute to society.  But with the millions of people who are killed even every year in the United States alone (and who knows how many others in other countries?), we'll never know what great people they could have been.  (EDIT: Actually this doesn't even matter--do those who become great people have more of a right to life than those who don't?  Absolutely not--we all have the same right.)  As Clarence said in ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""Harry wasn't there to save them because you weren't there to save Harry.""  To kill even one person is a genocide because you're not just killing that person, but all the descendants he might have had, and all the people he and/or his descendants might have saved--and those people's descendants, and any people they and/or their descendants might have saved, and on and on.  We need to think about things like this--and as Jesus said, even nursing unnecessary negative feelings against other people (especially out of a desire to blame them rather than take responsibility ourselves) is the first step towards nursing the desire to kill, or at least to support someone's death.I would be a hypocrite if I did not accuse myself first and foremost.  I am guilty of this very mentality, and I was far more guilty before I returned to the Church--not of killing anyone, thank God, but of desiring the most horrible things for them.  Not only was I ""pro-choice"" but some people (I won't say who) so irritated me that I actually hoped they would (or if they were dead, was confident that they were) ""roasting in hell"".  That's the worst possible fate you could wish on anyone, and what we wish for others, we're asking for ourselves.  I don't want to go to hell, and I don't want that for anyone else.  However, I know how hard it is to recover from deep-seated vices: I no longer actively desire bad things to happen to anyone but some people still irritate me, and it's a constant struggle to remind myself that I need to love and respect them as people, and this has nothing to do with their actions.  Love the sinner, hate the sin--hating the sin doesn't mean you hate the one doing the sin, nor does loving the sinner mean loving the sin they do.  I cannot control what other people will do, only what I will do--but I can pray, and spread the word, and encourage right actions and discourage wrong actions.  That, at least, is something.The point is, none of us are strong enough to manage love on our own, but Christ gives us that strength, even when we may not realize it (because He doesn't need us to believe in Him to act in our lives)--not because we deserve it but because He chooses to.  It's only up to us to decide if we will accept or reject it--and we only control what we do, not what others do.In any case, that, I think, is the point of this film, hence why Mr. Gibson decided to set it in a culture that practiced human sacrifice before the Church came, and so was in desperate need of Baptism.  I think he was comparing this civilization to our own and calling for us to change our ways for the better--because if we don't change what we do (what we ourselves have control over), then nothing will change for the better.  In the words of the sage Dr. Seuss, ""Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better.  It's not.""God bless you all.",3,"Three stars for concept, minus two for execution",1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,11083,"['hype', 'violence', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as',

Mel Gibson directs this powerful film that made many critics claim that it was ""the best movie of the year"" as well as ""brutally violent"" and ""shockingly disturbing."" Watching this film I have to say that it is more about the story of one man struggling to overcome the odds to get back to the ones he loves and even though there is violence its a small part compared to the larger picture.Rudy Youngblood plays a man named Jaguar Paw in Mayan times. He and his tribe are very comfortable, living in their part of their forest. However just one day after meeting another tribe that was passing through their lands because they were attacked by something, Jaguar Paw and his tribe are attacked and taken prisoner by a third tribe. Many of Jaguar Paw's fellow villagers are killed, most are taken prisoner, but Jaguar Paw's wife and kid are trapped in an underground well after trying to escape.After being bound together, Jaguar Paw and a few of his tribesmen are led on a long journey to a huge temple kingdom somewhere far away. It is there that Jaguar Paw realizes that they are meant to be sacrifices to a god that thier captors worship. After what seems to be a miracle saves Jaguar Paw's life, Jaguar Paw has to escape and get back to his wife and child before it is too late.Apocalypto definately is not for those who cant stand the sight of blood, and the sacrifice scenes are indeed hard to watch for their brutally realistic reenactments. However the story of Jaguar Paw stuggling to stay alive to be with his family, especially his wife who is expecting another child, is something to be seen for the powerful performances that are shown in this film.What also is a good original idea for the film is showing the entire film in English subtitles but also with the actually Mayan subtitles being shown as well. I found it really interesting listening to the way the villagers interacted with each other and seeing how different and slightly similar the different tribes were when compared together. Even Jaguar Paw's captors and himself share some common traits. Another thing I liked about this movie is the beautiful scenery. Giant waterfalls, dense jungles, huge fields, and beautiful ancient cities make this movie something that definately needs to be seen to get lost in.

1005879,A3OJ135FL6R7LO,B000GNOKQG,"Thomas M. Kara ""dilettante extraordinaire""","[4, 10]","Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" opens with a quotation by the historian Will Durant that a great civilization cannot be conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within, and this thesis clearly informs Gibson's message, which is is that the native American empires were only ripe for conquest because they were morally decayed.  This moral message is not surprising considering Mel Gibson's religious views, even if it may seem ironic in a film that bathes the viewer in hours of sadistic and often gratuitous gore.  At the same time, Apocalypto is a fast paced action movie that is brilliantly filmed and well-acted.  While it is both narrow-minded and fundamentally inaccurate  to portray the great Mayan, Aztec or any other ancient civilizations as primarily war-mongering,  blood-lusting societies, sated only by the suffering they are able to inflict on innocent conquered peoples,  Gibson does manage, within this narrow focus, to make us feel the intense pain and suffering that has been the lot of much of humanity, and for that matter still is.  Some will take issue with the degree to which they are required to suspend disbelief in a movie filled with last minute chance escapes, miraculous coincidences, and apparently super-human endurance as the wounded main character is chased through the jungle in an attempt to escape and save his pregnant wife and child.  One could argue that the main plot and theme could have been preserved with less reliance on these devices, which may satisfy children, but which should make adults roll their eyes.  In the end, Gibson reaffirms his view that good will triumph over evil, with an ending that further confirms the theological roots of the movie's plot:  the prophecies are spoken and fulfilled,  the symbolic Eden of the Central American jungle is given renewed life as Adam and Eve are allowed to return to their Garden and ""start a new beginning"", while those infested with the satanic rot of a pagan civilization face destruction by an incoming Christian invasion.  Given the main thesis, Gibson apparently believes the European conquest was not only justified but probably divinely ordained.  In spite of its excesses,  Apolcalypto certainly has enough depth to warrant respect as not only entertainment, but as a piece of art.",3,"Thoughtful, if excessively violent",1182643200,"06 24, 2007",2007,2298,"['Mel', 'Gibson', 'Apocalypto', 'quotation', 'historian', 'Will', 'Durant', 'great', 'civilization', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'conquered', 'destroyed', 'thesis', 'clearly', 'Gibson', 'message', 'native', 'American', 'empires', 'were', 'only', 'ripe', 'conquest', 'were', 'morally', 'decayed', 'moral', 'message', 'not', 'surprising', 'considering', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'religious', 'views', 'even', 'may', 'seem', 'ironic', 'film', 'viewer', 'hours', 'sadistic', 'often', 'gratuitous', 'gore', 'same', 'time', 'Apocalypto', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'movie', 'brilliantly', 'filmed', 'well-acted', 'narrow-minded', 'fundamentally', 'inaccurate', 'portray', 'great', 'Mayan', 'Aztec', 'other', 'ancient', 'civilizations', 'primarily', 'war-mongering', 'blood-lusting', 'societies', 'sated', 'only', 'suffering', 'are', 'able', 'inflict', 'innocent', 'conquered', 'peoples', 'Gibson', 'manage', 'narrow', 'focus', 'make', 'feel', 'intense', 'pain', 'suffering', 'been', 'lot', 'much', 'humanity', 'matter', 'still', 'will', 'take', 'issue', 'degree', 'are', 'required', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'movie', 'filled', 'last', 'minute', 'chance', 'escapes', 'miraculous', 'coincidences', 'apparently', 'super-human', 'endurance', 'wounded', 'main', 'character', 'chased', 'jungle', 'attempt', 'escape', 'save', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'child', 'One', 'could', 'argue', 'main', 'plot', 'theme', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'preserved', 'less', 'reliance', 'devices', 'may', 'satisfy', 'children', 'should', 'make', 'adults', 'roll', 'eyes', 'end', 'Gibson', 'view', 'good', 'will', 'triumph', 'evil', 'ending', 'further', 'theological', 'roots', 'movie', 'plot', 'prophecies', 'are', 'spoken', 'fulfilled', 'symbolic', 'Eden', 'Central', 'American', 'jungle', 'given', 'renewed', 'life', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'are', 'allowed', 'return', 'Garden', 'start', 'new', 'beginning', 'infested', 'satanic', 'rot', 'pagan', 'civilization', 'face', 'destruction', 'incoming', 'Christian', 'invasion', 'Given', 'main', 'thesis', 'Gibson', 'apparently', 'European', 'conquest', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'justified', 'probably', 'divinely', 'ordained', 'spite', 'excesses', 'Apolcalypto', 'certainly', 'enough', 'depth', 'warrant', 'respect', 'not', 'only', 'entertainment', 'piece', 'art']",N/A

1005881,A27FYYS44LH7KD,B000GNOKQG,Thucydides 1,"[3, 8]","-- No spoilers --It can be argued that the events seen in ""Apocalypto"", involving only a few ""story"" days, are actually a condensed view of the stagnation, decline, and decay that occured in Mayan civilization over hundreds of years. If understood this way, the story seems less like an unlikely sequence of strangely unusual *consecutive* events and more like Mel Gibson probably intended it: that is, as a tragic symphony tightly focused on Pre-Columbian Mayan civilization. This amplified interpretation is borne out in the movie's vision -- encompassing at first only a microcosm of the lives of people in a small tribe, but then expanding to include views of the highest reaches of Mayan architecture, art, manufacturing and commerce, society, and, inhuman, superstitious brutality. For these reasons, if not for the exceptionally gifted actors (largely unknown to American audiences), ornate set-building and costuming, and seamless, skillful camerawork and directing, the movie is a bizarre, macabre masterpiece.Now for a few shortcomings...1. Look at ""Language"" for this DVD here at Amazon and you'll see ""English"", but the only spoken language throughout the entire movie is Yucatec Mayan. English can be selected for subtitles. These flow very naturally, however, and are not at all distracting or disappointing2. There is little in the Special Features that explores the whole topic of Mayan civilization, except for the skill with which the production company reproduced it for making the film. I can only hope that a 2-disk set is released soon that may include more of this information. Maybe this is a somewhat unfair criticism because the story, per se, is not intended to be a semester-long history course.3. There is almost nothing in the Special Features about the superb actors and actresses. Who are they? Who is Rudy Youngblood, besides being an amazing young actor? Where does the cast come from? How did they feel about the characters they portrayed?  There is a partial view from one English-speaking actor in a key role about these kinds of questions, and the commentary, although very short, was very instructive and enjoyable. Again, if there's a 2-disk set offered, we can hope there would be more material about the actors themselves.4. Deep wounds don't improve that quickly, and a solar eclipse takes much longer also. But, in keeping with the ""symphony"" concept I envision, a certain amount of ""poetic license"" is deserved by the movie's makers.Already I'm hoping that Mr. Gibson will consider a sequel, showing a stunning collision between European and Mayan/Aztec civilizations. The first parts of ""Fire and Blood: A History of Mexico"", by T. R. Fehrenbach would make excellent source material.

1005882,A3NP8P2PHBZABD,B000GNOKQG,"Tidewater ""Whaler""","[1, 6]","The fact that the Mayan civilization died out well before the Spanish landed on the mainland of the Americas did not hinder the co-writers of this bloody jungle epic. The role given the Mayans in the film is simply the chore of obtaining captives to be supplied the priests for multiple blood sacrifices. This gruesome custom is well documented in the Aztec civilization, which was intact when the Spanish arrived, but the film maintains both that the Mayans participated in similar bloodletting and that their culture survived intact into the modern era. It perhaps is true that archeologists studying the Yucatan Mayan remains now believe that in fact multiple sacrificial bloodletting among Mayans actually occurred, but it is a certainty the Mayan culture did not survive long enough to see Spanish sailing ships as we do in this film.The heroes in the Gibson film are relatively peaceable jungle denizens whose villages are ruthlessly pillaged by a more warlike tribe who sell their captives to the Mayans, who in turn use them as slaves or for blood sacrifices. We do not see much of the fruits of Mayan culture, nor learn of their calendar, their astronomy, or other intellectual attainments. It's ersatz history shown from the bottom up, so to speak, and it's very well done in the sense that the violent action, the cast, the sets, the costumes, the makeup, etc., seem terribly authentic. It gets one thinking that the Spanish with their Jesuits can arrive none too soon to put a stop to the grotesque mayhem going on. To say the film depicts violence would be an understatement.The latter half of the film allows Jaguar Paw, our hero, to escape the Mayan enclave by surviving a gauntlet of bolos, clubs, spears and arrows. He then is pursued by very credible warriors. The chase, which is a terrific, almost wordless, adventure, goes on literally for days. It ends, implausibly, with the hero finally safe and reunited with his wife, who has given birth to a baby--underwater, no less. In the early part of the film, a diseased girl, treated as an outcast, predicts to the Mayans their end is coming, among other things via a jaguar and a dark day. The director makes sure that the audience cannot miss seeing the girl's predictions being fulfilled one by one.All in all, it's got to be the bloodiest adventure yarn ever filmed with what seems to me to be an ersatz historical affectation.",3,A heck of a yarn but somehow unconvincing,1212278400,"06 1, 2008",2008,2399,"['fact', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'died', 'out', 'well', 'Spanish', 'landed', 'mainland', 'Americas', 'did', 'not', 'hinder', 'co-writers', 'bloody', 'jungle', 'epic', 'role', 'given', 'Mayans', 'film', 'simply', 'chore', 'obtaining', 'captives', 'be', 'supplied', 'priests', 'multiple', 'blood', 'sacrifices', 'gruesome', 'custom', 'well', 'documented', 'Aztec', 'civilization', 'was', 'intact', 'when', 'Spanish', 'arrived', 'film', 'Mayans', 'participated', 'similar', 'bloodletting', 'culture', 'survived', 'intact', 'modern', 'era', 'perhaps', 'true', 'studying', 'Yucatan', 'Mayan', 'now', 'believe', 'fact', 'multiple', 'sacrificial', 'bloodletting', 'Mayans', 'actually', 'occurred', 'certainty', 'Mayan', 'culture', 'did', 'not', 'survive', 'long', 'enough', 'see', 'Spanish', 'sailing', 'ships', 'do', 'film.The', 'heroes', 'Gibson', 'film', 'are', 'relatively', 'peaceable', 'jungle', 'denizens', 'villages', 'are', 'ruthlessly', 'pillaged', 'more', 'warlike', 'tribe', 'who', 'sell', 'captives', 'Mayans', 'who', 'turn', 'use', 'slaves', 'blood', 'sacrifices', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'much', 'fruits', 'Mayan', 'culture', 'learn', 'calendar', 'astronomy', 'other', 'intellectual', 'attainments', 'ersatz', 'history', 'shown', 'bottom', 'up', 'speak', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'sense', 'violent', 'action', 'cast', 'sets', 'costumes', 'makeup', 'etc.', 'seem', 'terribly', 'authentic', 'one', 'thinking', 'Spanish', 'Jesuits', 'can', 'arrive', 'none', 'too', 'soon', 'put', 'stop', 'grotesque', 'mayhem', 'going', 'say', 'film', 'violence', 'would', 'be', 'understatement.The', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'hero', 'escape', 'Mayan', 'enclave', 'surviving', 'gauntlet', 'bolos', 'clubs', 'spears', 'arrows', 'then', 'pursued', 'very', 'credible', 'warriors', 'chase', 'terrific', 'almost', 'wordless', 'adventure', 'literally', 'days', 'implausibly', 'hero', 'finally', 'safe', 'reunited', 'wife', 'who', 'given', 'birth', 'baby', 'underwater', 'less', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'diseased', 'girl', 'treated', 'outcast', 'Mayans', 'end', 'coming', 'other', 'things', 'jaguar', 'dark', 'day', 'director', 'sure', 'audience', 'can', 'not', 'miss', 'seeing', 'girl', 'predictions', 'being', 'fulfilled', 'one', 'one.All', 'got', 'be', 'bloodiest', 'adventure', 'yarn', 'ever', 'filmed', 'what', 'be', 'ersatz', 'historical', 'affectation']",N/A

It is violent, but not more so than Michael Mann's brilliant ""Last of the Mohicans"" (1992) and other Academy Award winning films.  However, the misfits of Hollywood--who shape the opinions of the lemmings who follow them in lock step, and who badmouthed ""The Passion of the Christ"" (2004)--have been at it again.This time they have been hoping ""Apocalypto"" would fail too.  In the final analysis, Mel Gibson may be laughing all the way to the bank, and rightly so.

You will not be able to take your eyes off it. Gibson's third film as director is easily his best and continues his theme of a heroic man who suffers for the sake of others, as seen in both BraveHeart and the Passion. This hero is a reluctant one, a simple Mayan living in a small village which is raided by other Mayans to procure human sacrifices. When I say its a story with ""heart"", I am not referring to the ones ripped, still beating, from the chests of the unwilling participants of this brutal rite, but that the story, altho huge in scope, centers around a family of 3. The father is motivated to overcome the greatest odds because of his love for his wife and child. I also mean ""heart"" in the sense of courage (a word based on the French word for heart)for the young man must face terrifying enemies and predicaments. The peril is always extreme and unrelenting.Truly one of the best adventure films I have ever seen. I showed it to friends who dislike Mel Gibson and they were instantly converted to the view that, no matter what you think of Gibson, after you experience this film, you will admit that he is a masterful filmmaker. It is very violent and bloody but never gratuitous--he is faithfully portraying a violent, bloody culture and the film would be much less believable without it.

1005890,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000GNOKQG,trebe,"[0, 0]","No matter what you may think of Mel Gibson as a person, his film Apocalypto (2006) is truly an example of superb storytelling, and the realization of a vision to bring to the screen a period piece involving the Mayan culture, that is epic in scale, and brutally realistic, as a marauding band of warriors raids the jungle and gathers slaves.Set somewhere in the jungles of Central America, the movie's cast speak an archaic language, wear authentic attire, and use ancient tools and weapons.  Tattoos, scarification, piercing, and the insertion of objects into parts of the body, particularly the nose and ear lobe, were part of the Mayan culture, and a large crew of makeup artists, was employed to give the huge cast an authentic look.  Unfolding in stages, the story immediately draws you in, and is largely a learning experience, for those unfamiliar with the Mayan culture.  The acting performances are amazingly natural, and there are few instances where you don't feel that what you are seeing isn't real.  The pacing is brisk, and the story is told in a manner that feels like events are happening almost in real time.Events are centered on a young man named Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), the son of Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead), one of the leaders of a tribe living in the jungle.  With the goal of capturing alive as many of the adults as possible, a group of warriors led by Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo), and his lieutenant Middle Eye (Gerardo Teracena), attack Jaguar Paw's tribe.  The struggle is furious, brutal, and heartbreaking, as the film brilliantly captures the pure panic, naked fear, and cruel violence, as the tribe is overrun, struggles to resist, and is overcome by the superior force.During the fray, Jaguar Paw manages to lower his pregnant wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez), and his son into a deep pit, where they barely escape detection.  After watching his father leave on the journey to great beyond, Jaguar Paw and his fellow prisoners are bound together, and forced to trek through the jungle, abandoning the children of the village to fend for themselves.  Eventually they reach a great city, where the women are sold as slaves, and the men are forced to climb to the top of a massive ziggurat, where a sacrificial ceremony is taking place.  To appease the god Kukulkan, prisoners are held down, and their hearts are cut out.  The men are then beheaded, and their bodies flung down to crash the bottom.Jaguar Paw is on the altar, on the verge of meeting this fate, when a solar eclipse occurs.  Taken as a sign that the deity has been satisfied, Jaguar Paw and the remaining prisoners are spared, and taken to sandy field.  In pairs, they are given a chance to run to freedom, dodging the spears and arrows of the enemy warriors.  Killing one of Zero Wolf's sons, a wounded Jaguar Paw manages to escape into the jungle, pursued by Zero Wolf and a group of warriors.  The last act of the film features Jaguar Paw in a transcendental journey, as he runs for his life, and attempts to save his family.In regard to sets, costumes, language, and culture, Apocalypto goes to great lengths, attempting to be realistic.  Combined with some remarkably convincing acting performances, and often brutal action scenes, and you may find yourself drawn quite deeply into this unfamiliar, and often violent world, which is very close to nature.  Apocalypto is a compelling and often shocking saga, that makes a sincere attempt to explore and pay respect to an ancient culture, while telling a poignant, tragic, and thrilling story.  There are some very rough moments, but if you persevere, you may discover a new appreciation for the simple things in life, that you might have taken for granted.",5,"brutal and brilliant, Mel Gibson's triumph may engender self-reflection...",1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,3714,"['matter', 'what', 'may', 'think', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'person', 'film', 'Apocalypto', '2006', 'truly', 'example', 'superb', 'storytelling', 'realization', 'vision', 'bring', 'screen', 'period', 'piece', 'involving', 'Mayan', 'culture', 'epic', 'scale', 'brutally', 'realistic', 'marauding', 'band', 'warriors', 'raids', 'jungle', 'gathers', 'slaves.Set', 'somewhere', 'jungles', 'Central', 'America', 'movie', 'cast', 'speak', 'archaic', 'language', 'wear', 'authentic', 'attire', 'use', 'ancient', 'tools', 'weapons', 'Tattoos', 'scarification', 'piercing', 'insertion', 'objects', 'parts', 'body', 'particularly', 'nose', 'ear', 'lobe', 'were', 'part', 'Mayan', 'culture', 'large', 'crew', 'makeup', 'artists', 'was', 'employed', 'give', 'huge', 'cast', 'authentic', 'look', 'Unfolding', 'stages', 'story', 'immediately', 'largely', 'learning', 'experience', 'unfamiliar', 'Mayan', 'culture', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'amazingly', 'natural', 'are', 'few', 'instances', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', ""n't"", 'real', 'pacing', 'brisk', 'story', 'told', 'manner', 'events', 'are', 'happening', 'almost', 'real', 'time.Events', 'are', 'centered', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'Rudy', 'Youngblood', 'son', 'Flint', 'Sky', 'Morris', 'Birdyellowhead', 'one', 'leaders', 'tribe', 'living', 'jungle', 'goal', 'capturing', 'alive', 'many', 'adults', 'possible', 'group', 'warriors', 'led', 'Zero', 'Wolf', 'Raoul', 'Trujillo', 'lieutenant', 'Middle', 'Eye', 'Gerardo', 'Teracena', 'attack', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'tribe', 'struggle', 'furious', 'brutal', 'heartbreaking', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'pure', 'panic', 'naked', 'fear', 'cruel', 'violence', 'tribe', 'overrun', 'resist', 'overcome', 'superior', 'force.During', 'fray', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'lower', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'Seven', 'Dalia', 'Hernandez', 'son', 'deep', 'pit', 'where', 'barely', 'escape', 'detection', 'watching', 'father', 'leave', 'journey', 'great', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'fellow', 'prisoners', 'are', 'bound', 'together', 'forced', 'trek', 'jungle', 'abandoning', 'children', 'village', 'fend', 'Eventually', 'reach', 'great', 'city', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'sold', 'slaves', 'men', 'are', 'forced', 'climb', 'top', 'massive', 'ziggurat', 'where', 'sacrificial', 'ceremony', 'taking', 'place', 'appease', 'god', 'Kukulkan', 'prisoners', 'are', 'held', 'down', 'hearts', 'are', 'cut', 'out', 'men', 'are', 'then', 'beheaded', 'bodies', 'flung', 'down', 'crash', 'bottom.Jaguar', 'Paw', 'altar', 'verge', 'meeting', 'fate', 'when', 'solar', 'eclipse', 'Taken', 'sign', 'deity', 'been', 'satisfied', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'remaining', 'prisoners', 'are', 'spared', 'taken', 'sandy', 'field', 'pairs', 'are', 'given', 'chance', 'run', 'freedom', 'dodging', 'spears', 'arrows', 'enemy', 'warriors', 'Killing', 'one', 'Zero', 'Wolf', 'sons', 'wounded', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'escape', 'jungle', 'pursued', 'Zero', 'Wolf', 'group', 'warriors', 'last', 'act', 'film', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'transcendental', 'journey', 'life', 'attempts', 'save', 'family.In', 'regard', 'sets', 'costumes', 'language', 'culture', 'Apocalypto', 'great', 'lengths', 'attempting', 'be', 'realistic', 'Combined', 'remarkably', 'convincing', 'acting', 'performances', 'often', 'brutal', 'action', 'scenes', 'may', 'find', 'drawn', 'quite', 'deeply', 'unfamiliar', 'often', 'violent', 'world', 'very', 'close', 'nature', 'Apocalypto', 'compelling', 'often', 'shocking', 'saga', 'sincere', 'attempt', 'explore', 'pay', 'respect', 'ancient', 'culture', 'telling', 'poignant', 'tragic', 'thrilling', 'story', 'are', 'very', 'rough', 'moments', 'persevere', 'may', 'discover', 'new', 'appreciation', 'simple', 'things', 'life', 'might', 'have', 'taken', 'granted']",N/A

1005892,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000GNOKQG,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 2]","Mad Mel's Apocalypto turns out not to be quite the splatter movie it was painted by feint-hearted critics still reeling from all the welts in The Passion. Instead it's The Naked Prey revisited with slight hints of Kings of the Sun and even Rapa Nui, though rather than telling his story from the perspective of the Mayans he chooses to play down the spectacle and see it through the eyes of their intended sacrificial victims. The story is surprisingly slight - peaceful tribe get captured as human sacrifices for Mayan priests to appease their gods, only for one to make a run for freedom and the trapped wife and child he left behind - but he manages to instil it with more substance than you might expect without hitting you over the head with it. There's an ecological message about impending disaster, but unlike any of those touchy-feely New Age types, there's no imaginary native wisdom on display here: the Mayan civilisation may be an ancient one, but here it's every bit as stupid as its modern-day equivalents, blindly destroying itself and their environment, bringing plague and devastation as they destroy their depleting natural resources, distracting the people with a non-stop conveyer belt of bloody sacrifices. These are savage times, and the film's spectacular centrepiece in the Mayan city doesn't stint on the gore. Yet at the same time the characters are recognisable - they tell dirty stories, play practical jokes and B.S. each other as they get on with their lives. Even the raiding party are little different from a group of modern-day buddies on a fishing trip.With Gibson beginning his film with the same Will Durant quote that ended The Fall of the Roman Empire - `a great civilisation is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within' - it's clear that he's informed by Sixties epics as more than he is by Herzog's nutters in the jungle. Indeed, while he may eschew the Scope format he even shoots the Mayan city in the classic Anthony Mann style, discarding the big establishing shot but choosing instead to gradually reveal it as the characters are drawn into it, saving the big money shots for the end of the sequence. As a result, it's a much more convincing and layered depiction of its world and its many social levels than you'd expect for something other directors might have thrown away as a simple background walk-through.Yet after the spectacle, the film scales itself down again as it goes back to basics, and while it's not exactly an anti-climax, it's this section that keeps the film from being more than just pretty good. The big chase lacks the imagination and power of The Naked Prey (which also has the advantage of a much tighter running time), keeping the film at the level of just another survival-of-the-smartest action adventure. It's not bad, but it doesn't hold many surprises, going through many of the traditional means of disposing of your enemies that the movies have been offering since Leslie Banks stalked The Most Dangerous Game back in 1932, though Gibson does throw in a great ""There goes the neighbourhood"" punchline. He's also blessed with a couple of striking villains in the Wes Studi-like form of Raoul Trujillo as the chief manhunter Zero Wolf and Gerardo Taracena as the cocky sadist of the team, Middle Eye.While it's certainly the best-looking digitally shot feature to date, there are still some problems - with digital's persistent problems with catching high-speed motion, it's not the best idea to shoot a chase movie in digital even if you do have a cinematographer as good as Dean Semler, and some shots are distractingly subpar even on a small screen.It's interesting but not entirely surprising that the not exactly overloaded with extras DVD (just a commentary, half-hour making of and 35-second deleted scene) doesn't include the film's trailer, since looking at it after seeing the film it's clearly not only made up of footage that doesn't even appear in the film - mainly makeup, wardrobe and camera test footage - but it even seems to include a different leading man and a very different look for its native characters and even the Mayan city.",3,The Naked Prey meets Kings of the Sun on Rapa Nui,1197763200,"12 16, 2007",2007,4155,"['Mad', 'Mel', 'Apocalypto', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'quite', 'splatter', 'movie', 'was', 'painted', 'feint-hearted', 'critics', 'still', 'reeling', 'welts', 'Passion', 'Instead', 'Naked', 'Prey', 'revisited', 'slight', 'hints', 'Kings', 'Sun', 'even', 'Rapa', 'Nui', 'rather', 'telling', 'story', 'perspective', 'Mayans', 'play', 'down', 'spectacle', 'see', 'eyes', 'intended', 'sacrificial', 'victims', 'story', 'surprisingly', 'slight', 'peaceful', 'tribe', 'get', 'captured', 'human', 'sacrifices', 'Mayan', 'priests', 'appease', 'gods', 'only', 'one', 'make', 'run', 'freedom', 'trapped', 'wife', 'child', 'left', 'behind', 'instil', 'more', 'substance', 'might', 'expect', 'hitting', 'head', 'ecological', 'message', 'impending', 'disaster', 'touchy-feely', 'New', 'Age', 'imaginary', 'native', 'wisdom', 'display', 'here', 'Mayan', 'civilisation', 'may', 'be', 'ancient', 'one', 'here', 'bit', 'as', 'stupid', 'modern-day', 'equivalents', 'blindly', 'destroying', 'environment', 'bringing', 'plague', 'devastation', 'destroy', 'depleting', 'natural', 'resources', 'distracting', 'people', 'non-stop', 'conveyer', 'belt', 'bloody', 'sacrifices', 'are', 'savage', 'times', 'film', 'spectacular', 'centrepiece', 'Mayan', 'city', ""n't"", 'stint', 'gore', 'same', 'time', 'characters', 'are', 'recognisable', 'tell', 'dirty', 'stories', 'play', 'practical', 'jokes', 'B.S', 'other', 'get', 'lives', 'Even', 'raiding', 'party', 'are', 'little', 'different', 'group', 'modern-day', 'buddies', 'fishing', 'trip.With', 'Gibson', 'beginning', 'film', 'same', 'Will', 'Durant', 'quote', 'ended', 'Fall', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'great', 'civilisation', 'not', 'conquered', 'destroyed', 'clear', 'informed', 'Sixties', 'epics', 'more', 'Herzog', 'nutters', 'jungle', 'Indeed', 'may', 'eschew', 'Scope', 'format', 'even', 'shoots', 'Mayan', 'city', 'classic', 'Anthony', 'Mann', 'style', 'discarding', 'big', 'establishing', 'shot', 'choosing', 'instead', 'gradually', 'reveal', 'characters', 'are', 'drawn', 'saving', 'big', 'money', 'shots', 'end', 'sequence', 'result', 'much', 'more', 'convincing', 'layered', 'depiction', 'world', 'many', 'social', 'levels', ""'d"", 'expect', 'something', 'other', 'directors', 'might', 'have', 'thrown', 'away', 'simple', 'background', 'walk-through.Yet', 'spectacle', 'film', 'down', 'again', 'back', 'basics', 'not', 'exactly', 'anti-climax', 'section', 'film', 'being', 'more', 'just', 'pretty', 'good', 'big', 'chase', 'imagination', 'power', 'Naked', 'Prey', 'also', 'advantage', 'much', 'tighter', 'running', 'time', 'keeping', 'film', 'level', 'just', 'survival-of-the-smartest', 'action', 'adventure', 'not', 'bad', ""n't"", 'hold', 'many', 'surprises', 'going', 'many', 'traditional', 'means', 'disposing', 'enemies', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'offering', 'Leslie', 'Banks', 'stalked', 'Most', 'Dangerous', 'Game', 'back', '1932', 'Gibson', 'throw', 'great', 'neighbourhood', 'punchline', 'also', 'blessed', 'couple', 'striking', 'villains', 'Wes', 'Studi-like', 'form', 'Raoul', 'Trujillo', 'chief', 'manhunter', 'Zero', 'Wolf', 'Gerardo', 'Taracena', 'cocky', 'sadist', 'team', 'Middle', 'Eye.While', 'certainly', 'best-looking', 'digitally', 'shot', 'feature', 'date', 'are', 'still', 'problems', 'digital', 'persistent', 'problems', 'catching', 'high-speed', 'motion', 'not', 'best', 'idea', 'shoot', 'chase', 'movie', 'digital', 'even', 'do', 'have', 'cinematographer', 'as', 'good', 'Dean', 'Semler', 'shots', 'are', 'distractingly', 'subpar', 'even', 'small', 'screen.It', 'interesting', 'not', 'entirely', 'surprising', 'not', 'exactly', 'overloaded', 'extras', 'DVD', 'just', 'commentary', 'half-hour', 'making', '35-second', 'deleted', 'scene', ""n't"", 'include', 'film', 'trailer', 'looking', 'seeing', 'film', 'clearly', 'not', 'only', 'made', 'footage', ""n't"", 'even', 'appear', 'film', 'mainly', 'makeup', 'wardrobe', 'camera', 'test', 'footage', 'even', 'include', 'different', 'leading', 'man', 'very', 'different', 'look', 'native', 'characters', 'even', 'Mayan', 'city']",N/A

After all, it seemed to not get much hoopla from the critics, advertising, etc. And, of course, I did hear the usual putdowns of the movie by Hollywood types who are antagonistic toward Mel Gibson since ""The Passion of the Christ.""I love this movie!! Why? It's **original** and **daring**.Quick--name a movie out within the past twelve months that doesn't have Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, Owen Wilson, Nicole Kidman, Meg Ryan, and the rest of the same ol' same ol' blahblahblah ""superstars"" that people allegedly pay to see star in films. You didn't count very many films without ""stars"" did you? Here's an example: When ""Terminal"" came out I rented it **in spite of** the fact that Tom Hanks starred in it. (I'm so tired of Tom Hanks I could puke.) I loved the movie *in spite of* Tom Hanks starring in it! It was a fine story. Yes, Tom Hanks is a fine actor--but there are a lot of other fine actors out there, too. Thank God for Mel Gibson's efforts to find such actors. The screenplay of ""Apocalyto"" is very original as well. I commend Gibson for his daring.Yes, ""The Passion of the Christ"" was not perfectly historical (e.g., he put far too little blame on Pilate--who actually bore the main responsibility for Jesus' death--and he basically made Jesus and Mary into perfect little Roman Catholics.) That said, though, I admire Gibson's creativity. He is a genuine artist. Gibson could have easily taken the money from the POC movie and made several bland but profitable movies (starring Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidmans, or any other ""A-lister"") and made more money off such movies rather than making something as original as ""Apocalypo.""  That's what the usual movie executive would have done.Thank God Gibson didn't. And thank God for Mel Gibson.Great movie: I only gave it 4 stars though because it's not quite inthe same league as the creme of cinematic fare.

1005896,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000GNOKQG,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 4]","Mel Gibson continues to explore bravery and cruelty of humans. You can describe the story of ""Apocalypto"" in this way, but the fact is his latest work as director is a very engrossing adventure tale in the tradition of ""The Last of the Mohicans."" The difference is this adventure tale is set against the background of the last days of Mayan civilization; and as in his Oscar-winning ""Braveheart,"" ""Apocalypto"" comes with lots of violence.The story revolves around Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), his beloved wife Seven and young son, and the villagers living peacefully in the rainforest. One day his village is attacked by the merciless soldiers sent from the plague-infected city, where the captured men and women are brought for the purpose you have already guessed. Jaguar Paw knows he must come back home before the next rain falls because his wife (who is pregnant) and child are trapped in the bottom of a dried well, and he does it no matter what it takes.The story itself is rather conventional, but the way it is presented is unique. All the dialogues are spoken in the Mayan language, and most of the cast are non-professionals without previous experience as actor. The cinematography is by Dean Semler (""Dances with the Wolves""), but the shooting is mostly done digitally by HD camera. But you wouldn't mind all these things once the film starts to roll and tell its story about Jaguar Paw and the warriors chasing him in the jungle.As to the film's content, it is true that there is violence in the film (like the execution scene of ""Braveheart""), but it must be also pointed out that Mel Gibson does not make it gratuitous and excessive. Of course all these things depend on every viewer's sensitivity and certainly this film is not made for pre-teens, but Gibson avoids too direct descriptions of murders, rapes and decapitations.The production designs are amazing to see, but I am not sure of the historical accuracy of the customs of Mayan people or the streets and buildings of the city. I cannot judge that part. But I am sure this is an exciting, well-told adventure story that will keep you absorbed in the world unknown.",4,Mel Gibson's Engrossing Adventure Story,1184457600,"07 15, 2007",2007,2140,"['Mel', 'Gibson', 'explore', 'bravery', 'cruelty', 'humans', 'can', 'describe', 'story', 'Apocalypto', 'way', 'fact', 'latest', 'work', 'director', 'very', 'engrossing', 'adventure', 'tale', 'tradition', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'difference', 'adventure', 'tale', 'set', 'background', 'last', 'days', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'Oscar-winning', 'Braveheart', 'Apocalypto', 'lots', 'violence.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'Rudy', 'Youngblood', 'beloved', 'wife', 'Seven', 'young', 'son', 'villagers', 'living', 'peacefully', 'rainforest', 'One', 'day', 'village', 'attacked', 'merciless', 'soldiers', 'sent', 'plague-infected', 'city', 'where', 'captured', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'brought', 'purpose', 'have', 'already', 'guessed', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'must', 'come', 'back', 'home', 'next', 'rain', 'wife', 'who', 'pregnant', 'child', 'are', 'trapped', 'bottom', 'dried', 'well', 'matter', 'what', 'takes.The', 'story', 'rather', 'conventional', 'way', 'presented', 'unique', 'dialogues', 'are', 'spoken', 'Mayan', 'language', 'most', 'cast', 'are', 'non-professionals', 'previous', 'experience', 'actor', 'cinematography', 'Dean', 'Semler', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'shooting', 'mostly', 'done', 'digitally', 'HD', 'camera', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'things', 'once', 'film', 'roll', 'tell', 'story', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'warriors', 'chasing', 'jungle.As', 'film', 'content', 'true', 'violence', 'film', 'execution', 'scene', 'Braveheart', 'must', 'be', 'also', 'pointed', 'out', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'not', 'make', 'gratuitous', 'excessive', 'course', 'things', 'depend', 'viewer', 'sensitivity', 'certainly', 'film', 'not', 'made', 'pre-teens', 'Gibson', 'avoids', 'too', 'direct', 'descriptions', 'murders', 'rapes', 'decapitations.The', 'production', 'designs', 'are', 'amazing', 'see', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'customs', 'Mayan', 'people', 'streets', 'buildings', 'city', 'can', 'not', 'judge', 'part', 'am', 'sure', 'exciting', 'well-told', 'adventure', 'story', 'will', 'keep', 'absorbed', 'world', 'unknown']",N/A

It's pulp fiction--not the movie of that same name, but the type of adventure story found in the pulp magazines of the early Twentieth Century. It's Tarzan or Conan or Indiana Jones set in Sixteenth Century Central America--and as everyone else is pointing out, that's inaccurate history since the Mayan cities were abandoned centuries before the arrival of the Europeans--so historical accuracy is not actually important for this film, although a massive use of artists try to depict ""Mayan"" culture--250 make-up artists going full blast, no yet (and it's the make-up that really makes this movie) all working together to produce a couple of hours to dazzle the anthropologist-in-us-all for a fully loaded two hours. What a pleasure it is to see so much creativity at work on the details--these are the things you can do with a mega budget! 700 extras primped and flowered.As for the story, it's just pure plot, Hollywood-churn revenge and run to the finish action--Mel seems stuck in this concept of cinema--except this time, like the pulp stories, set in an exotic locale, and also like the pulp fiction, full of lucky, or not so lucky, coincidences and farfetched plot mechanisms that keep the action moving. Give the movie another hour and there'd probably be an earthquake or a hurricane thrown in somewhere and a crocodile or giant snake wrestle to keep things going. It's just paste, paste, and paste the right elements to get to the finish and then the Europeans are thrown in at the last moment simply to pretend this story has some greater significance than just an adrenalin thriller. There's no story here other than the standard big budget Hollywood standard. Too bad. Well, all the talent wasn't completely wasted this time. It was fun to watch most of the time and the behind the scenes feature shows how much thought the detailers put into their work.What's the message? ""Do not be afraid, my son."" Except when a panther is chasing you, then you better run like hell.If you are looking for attempts at historical accuracy about ""Native"" America, I strongly suggest, for one example, getting hold of a copy of Bruce Bereford's ""Black Robe."" It also uses actual dialects and makes a genuine attempt at telling an unbiased story that doesn't resort to the Hollywood cliches which ""Apocalypto"" is, unfortunately, chock full of.

1005899,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000GNOKQG,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","Set against the backdrop of a lush and lively jungle landscape, APOCALYPTO is a film about the death of an empire, the fall of a civilization, the salvation of a family, and one man's struggle against fear. The film opens with a group of hunters from a small village chasing a tapir. One of the leaders of the hunt is the protagonist of the film, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood). As the hunters are preparing the meat to take back to the village they are approached by a group of refugees who wish to pass through the forest. The strangers' village was decimated by warriors from the city of stone and they are traveling to a different place for a &#34;new beginning&#34; (apocalypto). The next morning Jaguar Paw's village is attacked and invaded by the warriors who had destroyed the refugees' village. Jaguar Paw hides his pregnant wife and young son in a hole, but he himself is taken captive. The captives are brought to the city of stone and along the way a diseased-stricken girl prophesizes the destruction of the Mayan empire because of their sins: slavery, human sacrifice, the raping of the Earth, etc. In the city, the women captives are sold as slaves and the men are brought to a pyramid to be sacrificed. Through a strange turn of events, Jaguar Paw's life is spared and he is able to escape. Chased by a group of warriors filled with blood lust, he rushes through the jungle to rescue his family before the rains come to drown them.APOCALYPTO is one of the best films I have seen this year. It is a violent film and there are some minor inaccuracies (especially in regards to some of the architecture of the city of stone).Also, the film is subtitled because the characters speak in a Mayan dialect. Nevertheless, none of this takes away from the power of the film.The cinematography is amazing. The people, animals, and vegetation seem almost three-dimensional. The scenery in the film is more vivid than any nature documentary that I have ever seen.Then there's the acting. The actors' performances are quite remarkable, especially considering the film's location and the challenge of speaking in an almost dead language. The central characters are rich and deep. Watching the movie, a person becomes entangled in their lives. Much of that is because of the acting, but some of it is because of the writing and directing, too.The storytelling uses everything from the Biblical Book of Revelation and the story of the Tower of Babel to epic Greek poems such as THE ILLIAD to John Rambo in FIRST BLOOD as allusions and references to firmly cement the film in our own shared and inherited cultural heritage. Whatever one may think about his past public indiscretions, Mel Gibson is a gifted and talented filmmaker that should not be ignored.The story is not only engaging, but it is a powerful parable, too. We might not, yet, live in a culture and society that is as violent as the Mayans, but we are guilty of many of the same sins. We enslave people by not paying them decent wages for the jobs they perform and by paying powerful executives money they don't deserve, we sacrifice our children upon an alter called choice, and we rape the Earth in almost the same ways as the urban Mayans do in APOCALYPTO. Like the city-dwelling Mayans in the film, we often choose to not only ignore what we do but the consequences of those actions as well. This chosen ignorance means little because the results of those actions remain, reminding us of our sin and folly.APOCALYPTO is a violent movie. For example, men have their throats slit, people are beheaded, priests rip out peoples' hearts, heads literally roll down the stairs of a pyramid, and a man has his face chewed off by a jaguar. It's all very bloody and slightly gory, yet it's not anywhere near as violent or gory as movies such as HOSTEL or SAW III. Also, unlike those films the violence in APOCALYPTO isn't useless; it serves a purpose.APOCALYPTO is a grand film. Containing magnificent acting, brilliant direction, and amazing cinematography, as well as a plot that serves as a powerful parable for our time, it is one of the best movies of 2006.",5,Powerful Parable for Our Time,1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,4118,"['Set', 'backdrop', 'lush', 'lively', 'jungle', 'landscape', 'APOCALYPTO', 'film', 'death', 'empire', 'fall', 'civilization', 'salvation', 'family', 'one', 'man', 'struggle', 'fear', 'film', 'group', 'hunters', 'small', 'village', 'chasing', 'tapir', 'One', 'leaders', 'hunt', 'protagonist', 'film', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'Rudy', 'Youngblood', 'hunters', 'are', 'preparing', 'meat', 'take', 'back', 'village', 'are', 'approached', 'group', 'refugees', 'who', 'wish', 'pass', 'forest', 'strangers', 'village', 'was', 'decimated', 'warriors', 'city', 'stone', 'are', 'traveling', 'different', 'place', '34', 'new', 'beginning', '34', 'apocalypto', 'next', 'morning', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'village', 'attacked', 'invaded', 'warriors', 'who', 'had', 'destroyed', 'refugees', 'village', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'young', 'son', 'hole', 'taken', 'captive', 'captives', 'are', 'brought', 'city', 'stone', 'way', 'diseased-stricken', 'girl', 'destruction', 'Mayan', 'empire', 'sins', 'slavery', 'human', 'sacrifice', 'raping', 'Earth', 'etc', 'city', 'women', 'captives', 'are', 'sold', 'slaves', 'men', 'are', 'brought', 'pyramid', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'strange', 'turn', 'events', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'life', 'spared', 'able', 'escape', 'Chased', 'group', 'warriors', 'filled', 'blood', 'lust', 'jungle', 'rescue', 'family', 'rains', 'come', 'drown', 'them.APOCALYPTO', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'violent', 'film', 'are', 'minor', 'inaccuracies', 'especially', 'regards', 'architecture', 'city', 'stone', '.Also', 'film', 'subtitled', 'characters', 'speak', 'Mayan', 'dialect', 'Nevertheless', 'none', 'away', 'power', 'film.The', 'cinematography', 'amazing', 'people', 'animals', 'vegetation', 'seem', 'almost', 'three-dimensional', 'scenery', 'film', 'more', 'vivid', 'nature', 'documentary', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.Then', 'acting', 'actors', 'performances', 'are', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'especially', 'considering', 'film', 'location', 'challenge', 'speaking', 'almost', 'dead', 'language', 'central', 'characters', 'are', 'rich', 'deep', 'Watching', 'movie', 'person', 'entangled', 'lives', 'Much', 'acting', 'writing', 'directing', 'too.The', 'storytelling', 'uses', 'everything', 'Biblical', 'Book', 'Revelation', 'story', 'Tower', 'Babel', 'epic', 'Greek', 'poems', 'such', 'THE', 'ILLIAD', 'John', 'Rambo', 'FIRST', 'BLOOD', 'allusions', 'references', 'firmly', 'cement', 'film', 'own', 'shared', 'inherited', 'cultural', 'heritage', 'one', 'may', 'think', 'past', 'public', 'indiscretions', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'gifted', 'talented', 'filmmaker', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'ignored.The', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'engaging', 'powerful', 'parable', 'too', 'might', 'not', 'yet', 'live', 'culture', 'society', 'as', 'violent', 'Mayans', 'are', 'guilty', 'many', 'same', 'sins', 'enslave', 'people', 'not', 'paying', 'decent', 'wages', 'jobs', 'perform', 'paying', 'powerful', 'executives', 'money', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'sacrifice', 'children', 'alter', 'called', 'choice', 'rape', 'Earth', 'almost', 'same', 'ways', 'urban', 'Mayans', 'do', 'APOCALYPTO', 'city-dwelling', 'Mayans', 'film', 'often', 'choose', 'not', 'only', 'ignore', 'what', 'do', 'consequences', 'actions', 'as', 'well', 'chosen', 'ignorance', 'little', 'results', 'actions', 'remain', 'reminding', 'sin', 'folly.APOCALYPTO', 'violent', 'movie', 'example', 'men', 'have', 'throats', 'slit', 'people', 'are', 'beheaded', 'priests', 'rip', 'out', 'peoples', 'hearts', 'heads', 'literally', 'roll', 'down', 'stairs', 'pyramid', 'man', 'face', 'chewed', 'off', 'jaguar', 'very', 'bloody', 'slightly', 'gory', 'not', 'anywhere', 'violent', 'gory', 'movies', 'such', 'HOSTEL', 'SAW', 'III', 'Also', 'films', 'violence', 'APOCALYPTO', ""n't"", 'useless', 'purpose.APOCALYPTO', 'grand', 'film', 'Containing', 'magnificent', 'acting', 'brilliant', 'direction', 'amazing', 'cinematography', 'as', 'well', 'plot', 'powerful', 'parable', 'time', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '2006']",N/A

We - the people that finished school - all know that mayan cities like Chichen Itza, Uxmal, Mayapan, Chetumal and Tayasal were still populated until almost 1700 (18th century), when they were finally conquered by the Spanish!!!Please, go back to school instead of giving history lessons!!!- Other said ""mayas were mathematics and astronomers"" and ""didn't sacrifice people like that"".Do you, people, really know just something about the mayas???All archeologists know that these guys sacrificed people just as wantonly as the Aztecs, and in the same numbers, and that they were obsessed by the skies not because they were mystic or new age, but for very earthly reasons: the old game called dominance (you know: information is power).Just pay atention to the scene of the sacrifice and the eclipse, and the mocking smiles of the king and the high priest at the top of the pyramid, knowing exactly how to dominate the ignorant populace below with a perfectly predictable astronomical event, and easily manipulating the massive fear caused by those minutes of ""darkness"".The laugh of the bloodied priest tells all!- Someone said ""A lunar eclipse does not come and go in a matter of a few minutes""Hello, earth???A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow!!! A solar eclipse is when the moon gets between the earth and the sun, making it ""dissapear"" and it just lasts seven minutes at most!!!- Finally, people just hate Mel because he's rich, drunk, christian and antisemite, in other words...

But as it opens, it kind of wanders here and there, and never really finds a believable or understandable plot. The opening scenes focus on a certain young man, and you believe he's going to wind up being the main character. About an hour in, the story suddenly and inexplicably shifts to another young man, and HE winds up being the main character. The rest of the film is nothing but ""bad guys storm their village, kidnap everyone, how does Main Character Guy escape and reunite with his wife and children?"" You already know he's not going to die. You already know he's going to find his family. There's no suspense, no tension, because you already KNOW he's going to outwit the bad guys and win. Jumping off a waterfall? Big deal, you know he won't drown. Chased by a jaguar? You already know he won't get eaten. Rain pouring into the pit where his family is hiding? You already know they won't drown (which brings me to another gripe; in one scene, his wife and children are stuck in this pit, rain water pouring in, their heads are mere inches above water, and in the next scene, they're all up and out of the pit and walking along together, dry and perfectly safe; huh??). The rest of the story has the potential to be interesting, but it's all drowned out with blood, guts, gore, murder, torture, violence, death. Seriously, how many bloody, squishy, gooey ways to die can we see in one movie? Pretty much everyone gets sliced, diced, gored, eaten, stabbed, shot, impaled, beheaded... except Main Character Guy and his family. All the good guys die, all the bad guys die. MCG and his family wander off into the forest to ""seek a new beginning"", just as the Conquistadors are landing on the beach nearby. Umm.. OK? LASTLY... this is a loooong movie, over 2 hours.

It is probably the most horrifically suspenseful chase film ever made. Apocalypto is the second. In The Naked Prey, Cornel Wilde is a white hunter in Africa whose client offends a native chief, and is therefore punished by the tribe by being turned into their prey. That is exactly what happens in Apocalypto, except that the prey is a South American indian that has been captured by a neighboring tribe and then released to be hunted. I have no doubt that Mel Gibson got his idea from that earlier film.Both films contain the victim and his party being captured unexpectedly; horrific scenes of torture of the members of his party; and the remaining victim being turned loose to be hunted like an animal. In The Naked Prey, the torture is a variety of inhumane and humiliating ends to the members of Wilde's hunting party. In Apocalypto, it is human sacrifice atop a Mayan ziggurat. In both films, the hero is saved for a special hunt in which he is the prey. But the hunters never expect an extended chase, and they certainly don't expect to be picked off one-by-one by their victim - but that's exactly what happens, and it makes for two very exciting films.Apocalypto is not for everyone. If you're squeamish, I would not recommend it. It is brutally real, disturbingly graphic and relentlessly intense - as is The Naked Prey. Also, it has subtitles - the Yucatan language, no less. But it is a very good story with an exceptional chase scene in the second half. It does not have a message - I don't care what Mel Gibson has said about declining civilizations and soldiers dying needlessly in Iraq. The Mayan civilization is not the subject of this film - merely its backdrop. Even the byline on the poster - ""No one can outrun their destiny"" - is misleading. This is not a film about destiny catching up with someone. If anything, it is about someone escaping a destiny imposed on him by other human beings.Apocalypto is a very simple story about a young man named Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and his young family, who are members of a small tribe in the middle of the Yucatan jungle, that wake up one morning to find themselves being attacked and overwhelmed by a group of fellow-natives from a nearby Mayan city. The adult villagers that survive the attack are carried off in ""chains,"" leaving the children behind to fend for themselves; but before his capture, Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and young son in a cistern, promising to return for them.The captives are taken to a city that is full of activity, most of it strange and difficult to understand - like slaves working in a quarry, removing some kind of white powder, its dust making their bodies white. These white people look weird walking through the streets of the city carrying their baskets of white powder. Where are they going? Then we see: the white powder is being used to plaster the walls of their buildings.There are women whose hands are covered with blue paint, and they begin smearing it all over the bodies of the captives. ""Why are they doing this to us?"" the victims wonder. Then we see: as they are being led through a tunnel, there are drawings on its walls, paintings of blue people being sacrificed, being mutilated, being decapitated. Then they come out of the tunnel and see a great ziggurat surrounded by people that are ""worshipping."" On top of the ziggurat, priests are doing the things depicted on the tunnel walls. Once they've decapitated their victims, they roll their heads down the ziggurat steps as the worshippers cheer and a new batch of blue people are led to the top. Now Jaguar Paw and his friends know exactly why they have been brought here. Soon it will be their heads rolling down the steps.It is quite interesting to see a primitive and ancient civilization depicted in this way. It is quite disturbing to see evil depicted in this way. The Mayans were a primitive civilization - I don't care how much archaeologists decry Mel Gibson for emphasizing their blood-thirst and playing down their scientific and other achievements. I think he has hit the nail on the head as far as what these people were: pagan beasts. And yet, they were created in God's image. It shows how low man can sink in his depravity when he has turned his back on God. It also shows the horrors of slavery, and how a person can be reduced in mind, body and spirit when he is forced to submit to the will and whims of another human being.But there is a golden lining to this dark, nightmarish vision: one of the captives waiting to be sacrificed at the top of the ziggurat has hope. He remembers his pregnant wife and young son, and how they are depending on him. If he doesn't return to their village and remove them from the cistern, the next big rain will drown them. He knows he must live to help them. That is the real story. The rest is merely the hell from which he must escape, and the dogs of hell he must out-run.Besides Rudy Youngblood, Raoul Trujillo turns in a powerful performance as Zero Wolf, Jaguar Paw's nemesis. Because of the subtitles, dialog is kept to a minimum in this Mel Gibson - Farhad Safina script. Production values are high throughout, with art direction taking center stage. Then there is the location: even though the jungle is lush, even though it is lovely at times, jungle life is harsh and brutal. My favorite scenes occur on a raging river. There is also a very good scene featuring a beautiful jaguar.Michael Medved gave this film four stars out of four. I would give it five out of five. It is exceptional. But it is not for everyone. Nothing is romanticized in this film, nothing is idealized. It is hard, cold reality - jungle style.Waitsel Smith",5,EDGE-OF-YOUR-SEAT CHASE FILM IN TRADITION OF THE NAKED PREY,1176336000,"04 12, 2007",2007,5766,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Naked', 'Prey',

It's a visually stunning adventure epic that even has a message at its core (although Gibson doesn't beat us over the head with it). Jaguar Paw and his people are attacked and kidnapped to be used as sacrifices for the Mayan gods. It seems that as they have strip mined their own land to build greater temples, they've also caused famine, disease and death to take hold as well. Paw must escape to save his pregnant wife and son who were left behind and are hiding before it is too late.The second half of the film reminded me quite a bit of both Cornell Wilde's ""The Naked Prey"" and ""The Most Dangerous Game"" with its cat and mouse chase through the rain forest as Janguar Paw is pursued after he escapes. You should be aware that the film is in ancient Mayan with English, Spanish and French subtitles. The film received an ""R"" rating for violence probably deserved given the graphic nature of the first half and last third of the film.The film provides an interesting parallel for our modern world; the Mayans (like today) end up destroying much of their world in pursuit of building larger monuments to their greatness and living out their fantasy as the pinnacle of modern civilization. The result is famine, deforestation, disease and death.The sharp direction, performances, cinematography and music allows the viewer to overlook some of the minor flaws of the film such as the simple story.  He also clearly has an innate sense for the power of cinema--the image and he lets the image carry the story knowing, in a sense, that it makes up for the weaknesses of the story itself. Gibson's ecological parable has a corker of an ending that comes totally out of left field (in fact Gibson in his commentary states that the film was originally build around this conclusion which was meant as something of a joke. Surprisingly, that conclusion works very well indeed).The DVD looks and sounds stunning. While the extras are somewhat meager (only a short documentary on the making of the film, a deleted scene and a commentary track by co-writer/director/co-producer Gibson with co-writer/co-producer Farhad Safinia)they aren't fluff. The documentary shows the challenge that Gibson and his crew faced in building many of the massive sets, providing make up for a large group of people and working largely with non-actors.Hopefully a deluxe edition will be in the pipeline at some point with some historical featurettes/documentaries. While the film isn't 100% historical accurate, Gibson uses the trappings well and incorporates as much as he can into the film to give it a feeling of ""reality"". This is a well made, visually stunning film that deserved a far better outcome at the box office.Sure, this film is a variation on the noble savage theme again but Gibson does such a marvelous job with the material that I'm willing to overlook the cliches of the story itself. Gibson doesn't get preachy in his message but just lays it out there while allowing his film to do the speaking for him.",4,Visually stunning adventure epic,1179792000,"05 22, 2007",2007,3098,"['Mel', 'Gibson', 'Apocalypto', 'past', 'telling', 'commentary', 'present', 'visually', 'stunning', 'adventure', 'epic', 'even', 'message', 'core', 'Gibson', ""n't"", 'beat', 'head', 'Jaguar', 'Paw', 'people', 'are', 'attacked', 'kidnapped', 'be', 'used', 'sacrifices', 'Mayan', 'gods', 'have', 'strip', 'mined', 'own', 'land', 'build', 'greater', 'temples', ""'ve"", 'also', 'caused', 'famine', 'disease', 'death', 'take', 'hold', 'as', 'well', 'Paw', 'must', 'escape', 'save', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'son', 'who', 'were', 'left', 'behind', 'are', 'hiding', 'too', 'late.The', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'reminded', 'quite', 'bit', 'Cornell', 'Wilde', 'Naked', 'Prey', 'Most', 'Dangerous', 'Game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'chase', 'rain', 'forest', 'Janguar', 'Paw', 'pursued', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'film', 'ancient', 'Mayan', 'English', 'Spanish', 'French', 'subtitles', 'film', 'received', 'R', 'rating', 'violence', 'probably', 'deserved', 'given', 'graphic', 'nature', 'first', 'half', 'last', 'third', 'film.The', 'film', 'interesting', 'parallel', 'modern', 'world', 'Mayans', 'today', 'end', 'up', 'destroying', 'much', 'world', 'pursuit', 'building', 'larger', 'monuments', 'greatness', 'living', 'out', 'fantasy', 'pinnacle', 'modern', 'civilization', 'result', 'famine', 'deforestation', 'disease', 'death.The', 'sharp', 'direction', 'performances', 'cinematography', 'music', 'viewer', 'overlook', 'minor', 'flaws', 'film', 'such', 'simple', 'story', 'also', 'clearly', 'innate', 'sense', 'power', 'cinema', 'image', 'image', 'carry', 'story', 'knowing', 'sense', 'up', 'weaknesses', 'story', 'Gibson', 'ecological', 'parable', 'corker', 'ending', 'totally', 'left', 'field', 'fact', 'Gibson', 'commentary', 'states', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'build', 'conclusion', 'was', 'meant', 'something', 'joke', 'Surprisingly', 'conclusion', 'very', 'well', 'indeed', '.The', 'DVD', 'stunning', 'extras', 'are', 'somewhat', 'meager', 'only', 'short', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'deleted', 'scene', 'commentary', 'track', 'co-writer/director/co-producer', 'Gibson', 'co-writer/co-producer', 'Farhad', 'Safinia', 'are', ""n't"", 'fluff', 'documentary', 'challenge', 'Gibson', 'crew', 'faced', 'building', 'many', 'massive', 'sets', 'providing', 'make', 'up', 'large', 'group', 'people', 'working', 'largely', 'non-actors.Hopefully', 'deluxe', 'edition', 'will', 'be', 'pipeline', 'point', 'historical', 'featurettes/documentaries', 'film', ""n't"", '100', '%', 'historical', 'accurate', 'Gibson', 'trappings', 'well', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'film', 'give', 'feeling', 'reality', 'well', 'made', 'visually', 'stunning', 'film', 'deserved', 'far', 'better', 'outcome', 'box', 'office.Sure', 'film', 'variation', 'noble', 'savage', 'theme', 'again', 'Gibson', 'marvelous', 'job', 'material', ""'m"", 'willing', 'overlook', 'cliches', 'story', 'Gibson', ""n't"", 'get', 'preachy', 'message', 'just', 'lays', 'out', 'there', 'allowing', 'film', 'do', 'speaking']",N/A
1005910,AM1C02CE4WGPC,B000GNOKQG,"W. Corse ""OldOneEye""","[5, 7]","Like many of you I missed the theatrical run, and not just because of Mel's bad mouth.  I had read/heard various comments about all the brutality and violence contained in this film, so I skipped it.  But the DVD beckoned to me recently at the store and I decided to trust my instincts.  Whatever kind of movie this might be, I said, it will be an honest effort by a gifted director, and I hadn't heard anyone say outright that it was a bad film.Other reviewers have already expressed two of my key points, so here's the bottom line:  this is a gripping, brutally honest movie about the human condition.  On one level, it looks at every person's struggle to survive in the world they're born into; on a deeper plane Gibson reminds all of us that all ""great"" civilizations fall into ruin.  To be precise, human beings aren't all that civilized in any century.Debating the historical accuracy of this type of film is pointless, because no one knows exactly how or why the Mayan empire vanished. (Global warming, perhaps?) All I know is that I'll never be able to look at those tall structures (a sort of ziggurat, reaching to heaven?) with those steep staircases which modern-day tourists struggle to climb so they can take their pictures -- without seeing the severed heads bouncing down those steps.  That's why they were built, folks, and that's all that's left of the great Mayan civilization today.For those of you still unclear about this:  YES, Mel is saying that all ""great"" human empires eventually decay from within. It happened to Egypt, Babylon, Rome, even France...and it can happen to us as well. This film throws buckets of cold water in the faces of anyone who subscribes to the ""noble savage"" myth -- those people were as debauched as the Romans at their worst, without the roads or nice togas.  And cruelty for its own sake remains the favorite human hobby even today.The action in this movie is top-notch, and the tension never lets up -- all that is true, and it's worth watching for that alone. (For those of you who used terms like ""bad"" or ""poorly made"" in your reviews, please provide the address of the alternate universe in which you reside.)  Mel's vision is a dark one, and it's scary because it's accurate.  And even if the ending isn't exactly ""happy"" in the traditional Hollywood sense, it's gratifying because it rings true.

Both films tell essentially the same story, but the former is cheap, shallow stuff from a hack director, while the latter is a highly skilled and emotionally involving entertainment. (It is perhaps significant that Emmerich relies heavily on models and CGI, while Gibson uses mostly practical effects, turning to CGI when it's the only way something can be done.) It is especially notable that, though Gibson's direction is almost free of any sort of sentimentality, we completely identify with the ""good"" characters, whereas Emmerich is clich&eacute;d, hokey, and largely uninvolving.Other than being a rousing (and unbelievably brutal) adventure story, it's hard to discern Mel Gibson's perspective. Is he attacking modern American materialism? Is he justifying the subjugation of the aboriginal peoples by the Spanish (if only because it ended human sacrifice)? Does he feel that the Mayan civilization /would not/ have been overthrown if it had not been so deeply involved in human sacrifice? * Is he suggesting that it is America's destiny and/or obligation to rule the world? ** Is he advocating a pagan lifestyle that is close to nature and far from the Christian church? The latter might seem strange coming from a conservative Catholic, but ""Apocalypto"" can indeed be interpreted that way. It is perhaps all these things -- or none of them.Gibson appears to be using ""apocalypse"" in its original sense -- a prophecy or revelation. Though there are prophecies and revelations throughout the film, the full intent becomes clear only in the last minute, not unlike ""Signs"". If nothing else, Gibson is searching for a sense that what happens on this plane of existance has purpose and meaning.Though ""Apocalypto"" is rightly rated R for its graphic brutality, it would not be inappropriate for older teens. It is a kind of insane ""travelogue"" that places the viewer in a largely unfamiliar environment, to exit with the feeling that one's life has been altered (if only slightly) by an experience that most humans are fortunate never to pass through. It's for this reason that I've rated ""Apocalypto"" five stars.PS: Contrary to what one poster wrote, the Mayan civilization continued up until the arrival of the Spanish. (There was, however, a general broad decline 700 years earlier.) If one wishes to dump on Mel Gibson, one might consider his lack of knowledge of basic astronomy. I leave it for viewers to spot the horrendous error.* The film's ""title quote"" is to the effect that a great civilization cannot be conquered from without unless it has destroyed itself from within. This is ascribed (quaintly) to ""W. Durant"" -- ie, Will Durant, the co-author of ""The Story of Civilization"", the mini-library that rests in the home of almost everyone who ever belonged to the Book of the Month Club.

It also has elements of ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Last of the Mohicans."" With the exception of ""The Naked Prey,"" ""Apocalypto"" isn't quite as good as any of these films, but it's still a very good jungle adventure.What makes ""Apocalypto"" a must is the simple fact that there aren't ANY other significant films that depict the Mayan civilization. Just as ""Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan"" brought to life the infamous Mongol conqueror and his people, so ""Apocalypto"" effectively brings to life the Mayans.The spoken language is Mayan with subtitles, but this is mainly a visual experience as there's no elaborate dialogue.There's not much else to say. This is essentially a film about the death throes of a civilization and the dawning of a new era. On a more individualist level, it's about recognizing one's true identity, denying fear and the bold spirit of survival. These themes are conveyed with nigh wall-to-wall jungle action and horror.The film was shot in Mexico and runs 2 hours and 19 minutes.GRADE: B+",4,Jungle action,1351036800,"10 24, 2012",2012,1375,"['Mel', 'Gibson', 'Apocalypto', '2006', 'out', 'Mayan', 'version', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'raid', 'destruction', 'forest', 'village', 'then', 'morphs', 'horror', 'story', 'captives', 'are', 'babarically', 'sacrificed', 'Mayan', 'pyramids', 'appease', 'gods', 'final', 'act', 'jungle', 'chase', 'reminiscent', 'Naked', 'Prey', 'Rambo', 'First', 'Blood', 'also', 'elements', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'exception', 'Naked', 'Prey', 'Apocalypto', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'films', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'jungle', 'adventure.What', 'Apocalypto', 'must', 'simple', 'fact', 'are', ""n't"", 'ANY', 'other', 'significant', 'films', 'depict', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'Just', 'Mongol', 'Rise', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'brought', 'life', 'infamous', 'Mongol', 'conqueror', 'people', 'Apocalypto', 'effectively', 'life', 'Mayans.The', 'spoken', 'language', 'Mayan', 'subtitles', 'mainly', 'visual', 'experience', 'elaborate', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'say', 'essentially', 'film', 'death', 'throes', 'civilization', 'dawning', 'new', 'era', 'more', 'individualist', 'level', 'recognizing', 'one', 'true', 'identity', 'denying', 'fear', 'bold', 'spirit', 'survival', 'themes', 'are', 'conveyed', 'nigh', 'wall-to-wall', 'jungle', 'action', 'horror.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Mexico', '2', 'hours', '19', 'minutes.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A

The characters are fun and intriguing to watch. One of the most realistic movies I have seen. But the final third of the movie was Hollywood textbook stuff. It has all been done before and we have seen it all in other movies such as The last of the Mohicans ( a jungle chase and the final duel ) Truth be told, I was waiting for the Europeans to arrive and add some intrigue ... :)But the scenes in the Maya cities were awesome. At that point, I was expecting great things from the movie. Everyone was dressed up. Great characters existed in everyone's mind. Even the Maya high priest was fearsome. At that moment, everyone was afraid. SPOILER AHEAD! - And then a solar eclipse! A highly improbable event. Within the space of ten minutes almost all of the characters are either killed or sacrificed without a struggle and those that remain are killed off in the remaining forty minutes through even more improbable events such as snake bites, traps and jaguars... I expected more at the end of the movie. Imagine the Europeans started killing off the Mayans in the city.

1005922,A16DFPRFMPA9LP,B000GNOKQG,"ZANZIBAR ""Hotep""","[1, 1]","This is a story of true Mayan warriors, who battled all odds to protect and save, what was most prescious to them (Family). Two people stood against what seemed like insurmountable odds & won. Jaguar Paw (lead character) was a most dynamic character but it was his wife 9 months pregnant, giving birth under water, which took the cake;this feat was accomplished in a quickly flooding well, while she balanced her 3 year old son on her shoulders. This took place while she was standing on a rock ledge no more than a few inches wide. Prior to this event Jaguar Paw's wife fended off a wild animal, striking it 3 times, before it finally died. There wasn't any of the usual panic you see in other movie depictions of a heroine in distress.Apocalypto illustrates the true nature of a warrior opposed to a soldier. This is the true warrior nature in all of humanity. What did Jaguar Paw say at the very end (let's go into the forrest and make a new beginning),deservingly so. Had they gone to greet the interlopers they would have been enslaved once again. Mel Gibson brought a little diversity into mainstream cinema, so I give it a five. It's much better than the passion of Christ.

1005923,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000GNOKQG,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[5, 16]","I think the fact that people aren't streaming to the theatres to see Apocalypto is proof enough that Passion of the Christ wasn't actually the ""modern masterpiece"" Christian groups made it out to be. People loved that movie out of religious fervor, not actual cinematic quality. Apocalypto falls somewhere between the brilliance of Braveheart and the Patheticness of Passion. It's just an alright movie.The sheer novelty of a movie about the Mayan civilization, in Mayan, with subtitles, is a draw for some people. And the trailer is beautiful. The movie itself has many beautiful moments, but it never really rises above being a chase movie / supernatural thriller. If it weren't for the awesome locations, costumes, and acting, this movie would be a typical thriller. But it DOES have all those things, so it's actually pretty enjoyable to watch.At times the violence and gore is difficult to deal with, but it can be argued that it's pretty historically accurate. It also makes the entire situation more heightened when you see what's truly at stake and the real ferocious nature of the Mayans.Aside from the violence, I didn't really find anything about the movie to be controversial. Honestly, it's not that deep of a movie. Without revealing too much, here's the general plot: a small village is raided, the villagers are taken for slaves and sacrifices, one of them escapes and is chased through the jungle. That's basically it.I'll leave it up to others to say Mel Gibson is bashing paganism, or drawing comparisons with the war in Iraq, or signalling aliens. I say he made a pretty cool movie that is worth a one-time viewing.",3,"On a quality scale of Passion to Braveheart, this one gets an Apocalypto",1166054400,"12 14, 2006",2006,1635,"['think', 'fact', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'streaming', 'theatres', 'see', 'Apocalypto', 'proof', 'enough', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'was', ""n't"", 'actually', 'modern', 'masterpiece', 'Christian', 'groups', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'People', 'loved', 'movie', 'religious', 'fervor', 'not', 'actual', 'cinematic', 'quality', 'Apocalypto', 'somewhere', 'brilliance', 'Braveheart', 'Patheticness', 'Passion', 'just', 'alright', 'movie.The', 'sheer', 'novelty', 'movie', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'Mayan', 'subtitles', 'draw', 'people', 'trailer', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'many', 'beautiful', 'moments', 'never', 'really', 'being', 'chase', 'movie', '/', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'were', ""n't"", 'awesome', 'locations', 'costumes', 'acting', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'typical', 'thriller', 'DOES', 'have', 'things', 'actually', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'watch.At', 'times', 'violence', 'gore', 'difficult', 'deal', 'can', 'be', 'argued', 'pretty', 'historically', 'accurate', 'also', 'entire', 'situation', 'more', 'heightened', 'when', 'see', 'what', 'truly', 'stake', 'real', 'ferocious', 'nature', 'Mayans.Aside', 'violence', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'anything', 'movie', 'be', 'controversial', 'Honestly', 'not', 'deep', 'movie', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'general', 'plot', 'small', 'village', 'raided', 'villagers', 'are', 'taken', 'slaves', 'sacrifices', 'one', 'escapes', 'chased', 'jungle', 'basically', 'it.I', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'up', 'others', 'say', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'bashing', 'paganism', 'drawing', 'comparisons', 'war', 'Iraq', 'signalling', 'aliens', 'say', 'made', 'pretty', 'cool', 'movie', 'one-time', 'viewing']",N/A
