843510,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0002PYSYM,Andrew Ellington,"[14, 15]","When `Le Ciociara' ends, in what may be the most brutal manner possible, one is caught off guard.  We didn't see that coming; but what is remarkable with this particular film is that we should have.  When one goes back through and watches the film, after knowing its devastating finale, you can pinpoint why this ending, why this utter travesty was necessary.`Le Ciociara' tells the story of Cesira and her beautiful young daughter Rosetta.  During World War II Cesira and her daughter flee from Rome in order to spare their lives and wind up staying in the town where Cesira grew up.  A younger man, Michele, falls in love with Cesira and forms a close bond with her and her daughter.  As the war rages on Cesira and those around her are subject to the cruelty of the soldiers and the inconvenience that comes from hiding.For the majority of the films running time it feels as though this is all this film is about, and it manages to be very engrossing and very enlightening; but there is much more lurking around the corner.I won't go into the tragedy that is soon to befall Cesira and her daughter, even though it is a major plot point that has been divulged before and you can easily uncover before watching the film.  I feel that to walk into this film knowing how it ends is a shame and ultimately takes away from the intended feeling delivered by director Vittorio De Sica and his impressive cast.  Walking into `Le Ciociara' blind, so-to-speak, adds to the velocity of the films conclusion, which is a resounding shock to the viewers emotional core.  It challenges all that we think we know about these two women, this mother and her daughter and serves as the moral dilemma with which movies like this thrive.Sophia Loren made history when she became the first actress to win an Academy Award for a foreign language performance.  Her performance may very well be one of the best in the history of cinema, a truly outstanding and dynamic portrayal of a real woman, trying to give her daughter the best she can, who is destroyed (almost literally) by the realization that she simply cannot do that.  Eleonora Brown, who plays Rosetta, is almost a ghost throughout the film, playing second fiddle to her mother and merely floating in and out of scenes, but as the film plummets towards its conclusion she rises to the occasion and delivers an equally devastating and real performance as her characters world is shattered and her innocence becomes stained with the harsh realities of this world.`Le Ciociara' is a film that will touch you, that will reach you in a way you may not have expected.  It's stark depiction of the fragile relationship between mother and daughter is disarming, for it is an unexpected peek at a brutal reality.  Superbly done, `Le Ciociara' is a masterpiece.*I just want to note that I do not own the DVD and thus cannot comment on the quality, which I hear is rather poor.  Please note that this is a review of the film, and the film only.",5,An unexpected punch adds deeper meaning to this remarkable film...,1236038400,"03 3, 2009",2009,2972,"['When', 'Le', 'Ciociara', 'ends', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'brutal', 'manner', 'possible', 'one', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'what', 'remarkable', 'particular', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'When', 'one', 'back', 'film', 'knowing', 'devastating', 'finale', 'can', 'pinpoint', 'why', 'ending', 'why', 'utter', 'travesty', 'was', 'necessary.', 'Le', 'Ciociara', 'story', 'Cesira', 'beautiful', 'young', 'daughter', 'Rosetta', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Cesira', 'daughter', 'flee', 'Rome', 'order', 'spare', 'lives', 'wind', 'up', 'staying', 'town', 'where', 'Cesira', 'grew', 'up', 'A', 'younger', 'man', 'Michele', 'love', 'Cesira', 'close', 'bond', 'daughter', 'war', 'Cesira', 'are', 'subject', 'cruelty', 'soldiers', 'inconvenience', 'hiding.For', 'majority', 'films', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'be', 'very', 'engrossing', 'very', 'enlightening', 'much', 'more', 'lurking', 'corner.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'tragedy', 'soon', 'befall', 'Cesira', 'daughter', 'even', 'major', 'plot', 'point', 'been', 'divulged', 'can', 'easily', 'uncover', 'watching', 'film', 'feel', 'walk', 'film', 'knowing', 'how', 'shame', 'ultimately', 'away', 'intended', 'feeling', 'delivered', 'director', 'Vittorio', 'De', 'Sica', 'impressive', 'cast', 'Walking', 'Le', 'Ciociara', 'blind', 'so-to-speak', 'velocity', 'films', 'conclusion', 'resounding', 'shock', 'viewers', 'emotional', 'core', 'think', 'know', 'two', 'women', 'mother', 'daughter', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'movies', 'thrive.Sophia', 'Loren', 'made', 'history', 'when', 'became', 'first', 'actress', 'win', 'Academy', 'Award', 'foreign', 'language', 'performance', 'performance', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'history', 'cinema', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'dynamic', 'portrayal', 'real', 'woman', 'trying', 'give', 'daughter', 'best', 'can', 'who', 'destroyed', 'almost', 'literally', 'realization', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'Eleonora', 'Brown', 'who', 'Rosetta', 'almost', 'ghost', 'film', 'playing', 'second', 'fiddle', 'mother', 'merely', 'floating', 'scenes', 'film', 'plummets', 'towards', 'conclusion', 'occasion', 'delivers', 'equally', 'devastating', 'real', 'performance', 'characters', 'world', 'shattered', 'innocence', 'becomes', 'stained', 'harsh', 'realities', 'world.', 'Le', 'Ciociara', 'film', 'will', 'touch', 'will', 'reach', 'way', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'expected', 'stark', 'depiction', 'fragile', 'relationship', 'mother', 'daughter', 'disarming', 'unexpected', 'peek', 'brutal', 'reality', 'Superbly', 'done', 'Le', 'Ciociara', 'masterpiece', '*I', 'just', 'want', 'note', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'DVD', 'thus', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'quality', 'hear', 'rather', 'poor', 'Please', 'note', 'review', 'film', 'film', 'only']",N/A

Frankly, I could not say that I love it because it is the story of a mother and a daughter who are raped during WW II in the countryside when they are trying to escape the bombing going on in Rome.  The portrayal of the rape was devastatingly real.  Had I known it would be so realistic, I don't think I would have purchased the film because of the reaction, mainly, of the 12 year old daughter to the horrible trauma.  It's not a happy movie, but the acting is superb.  If you have a penchant for wanting to see the effects of violence up close and personal, this is the film.  But if you, like me, cannot stand to see such devastation being wreaked on a woman and a child, you'll stay away from it despite the portrayal of the horrors of such a horrific act.

843514,A1VV4IJ5NKLWHC,B0002PYSYM,"Kendalene Markston ""Grateful Movie Locator""","[0, 0]","I first saw this black and white film on TV...in the Italian language with underlying English wording. I thought so much of this movie I had to purchase it. Was made in 1960; starring Sophia Loren. She won a much-deserved Oscar for her role. Sophia's role in the film is a war-ravaged widow with a sickly young daughter. The two of them escape daily air raids in Rome by escaping into the countryside. They endure many, many hardships in trying to survive. One sad experience is that they're both brutally raped by soldiers when they attempt seeking shelter in an abandoned church. Bad enough, but of all places for this to happen to them...Sophia does all she can--not only to help her devastated daughter, but herself...cooperate with soldiers and hard living conditions...and bands together with other individuals for solace, comfort, and the will to live. They tough things out, persevere--and in the end, they're helped/rescued, so eventually they move on with their lives, fortunately. It's a truly well-acted film and shows us all that where there's a will, there's a way. BTW, the DVD is NOT in Italian. English was dubbed in for the Italian, making it that much better...and the words were finely done to sound exactly as if in English. Truly a fantastic DVD which I most highly recommend.",5,"""Two Women""...Two Horrific Experiences",1316649600,"09 22, 2011",2011,1298,"['first', 'saw', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'TV', 'Italian', 'language', 'underlying', 'English', 'wording', 'thought', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'had', 'purchase', 'Was', 'made', '1960', 'starring', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'won', 'much-deserved', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Sophia', 'role', 'film', 'war-ravaged', 'widow', 'sickly', 'young', 'daughter', 'two', 'escape', 'daily', 'air', 'raids', 'Rome', 'escaping', 'countryside', 'endure', 'many', 'many', 'hardships', 'trying', 'survive', 'One', 'sad', 'experience', ""'re"", 'brutally', 'raped', 'soldiers', 'when', 'attempt', 'seeking', 'shelter', 'abandoned', 'church', 'Bad', 'enough', 'places', 'happen', 'Sophia', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'help', 'devastated', 'daughter', 'cooperate', 'soldiers', 'hard', 'living', 'conditions', 'together', 'other', 'individuals', 'solace', 'comfort', 'will', 'live', 'tough', 'things', 'out', 'persevere', 'end', ""'re"", 'helped/rescued', 'so', 'eventually', 'move', 'lives', 'fortunately', 'truly', 'well-acted', 'film', 'where', 'will', 'way', 'BTW', 'DVD', 'NOT', 'Italian', 'English', 'was', 'dubbed', 'Italian', 'making', 'much', 'better', 'words', 'were', 'finely', 'done', 'sound', 'exactly', 'English', 'Truly', 'fantastic', 'DVD', 'most', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

843516,A2WPAUTK46SQ31,B0002PYSYM,Steven Johnson,"[0, 0]","Like Bicycle Thieves over a decade earlier, Vittorio de Sica's powerful and, at times, heart-wrenching drama Two Women explores the relationship between parent and child, and how far a parent will go to protect his or her family.Sophia Loren gives a phenomenal performance, worthy of the Academy Award she won, with an emotional range and intensity I have never seen from her. Her acting flows from stern authority to bleak desparation with an authenticity that is difficult to achieve, yet she does so in a way that makes it look easy.Granted, much of that is due to de Sica's neorealistic filmmaking. Again, similar to Bicycle Thieves, we are given a snapshot of Italy at a specific time and place, rich with all the politics and people we would expect in that era. For a director so in control as de Sica certainly was, it sure doesn't feel like it; there is nothing cinematic-feeling about this film, which really does place us in the midst of the action without hyper stylized techniques to distract from the narrative.This subdued method of filmic enunciation makes the characters that much more accessible. When tragedy befalls the three leads, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Sophia Loren, and her daughter, we are truly heartbroken; we shared in these experiences with them, and we share their pain.De Sica's masterpiece Two Women takes audiences through all the cruelty and pain of war, and meets it with the strength humanity embodies even in the face of desperation. This is a wonderful film that illustrates the power of love and family when all else is lost.",5,"Wonderful film by de Sica!
