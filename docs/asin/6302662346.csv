By basing the movie on one of the original tv shows the viewers were given a sense of continuity that some movies that are based on previous tv shows don't have. Also, the story itself, while not all that original, was well written and suspenseful. Out of the 5 GUNSMOKE movies that were made I felt that this one was the best.Secondly, this movie did a fine job of bringing back the original cast members. Amanda Blake as &quot;Kitty&quot; and Buck Taylor as &quot;Newly O'brien&quot; helped to give this movie an authentic feel. Having said that it would have been nice if Dennis Weaver as &quot;Chester&quot; and or Ken Curtis as &quot;Festus&quot;, both served as deputy under Marshall Dillon, had made an appearance in the movie.Lastly, while the movie overall was a good one it seemed to me that James Arness portrayed Matt Dillon less like the character in the original series and more like the mountain man character of &quot;Zeb Macahon&quot; in his other western series HOW THE WEST WAS WON. Still this movie is a good view and those who like James Arness or GUNSMOKE will appreciate it.",3,Best of the return to GUNSMOKE movies,1038614400,"11 30, 2002",2002,1331,"['only', 'casual', 'fan', 'original', 'series', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'compare', 'contrast', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'producers', 'tv', 'film', 'seem', 'have', 'covered', 'bases.First', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'basing', 'movie', 'one', 'original', 'tv', 'viewers', 'were', 'given', 'sense', 'continuity', 'movies', 'are', 'based', 'previous', 'tv', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Also', 'story', 'not', 'original', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'suspenseful', '5', 'GUNSMOKE', 'movies', 'were', 'made', 'felt', 'one', 'was', 'best.Secondly', 'movie', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'bringing', 'back', 'original', 'cast', 'members', 'Amanda', 'Blake', 'quot', 'Kitty', 'quot', 'Buck', 'Taylor', 'quot', 'Newly', ""O'brien"", 'quot', 'helped', 'give', 'movie', 'authentic', 'feel', 'Having', 'said', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'quot', 'Chester', 'quot', 'Ken', 'Curtis', 'quot', 'Festus', 'quot', 'served', 'deputy', 'Marshall', 'Dillon', 'had', 'made', 'appearance', 'movie.Lastly', 'movie', 'overall', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'seemed', 'James', 'Arness', 'portrayed', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'less', 'character', 'original', 'series', 'more', 'mountain', 'man', 'character', 'quot', 'Zeb', 'Macahon', 'quot', 'other', 'western', 'series', 'HOW', 'THE', 'WEST', 'WAS', 'WON', 'Still', 'movie', 'good', 'view', 'who', 'like', 'James', 'Arness', 'GUNSMOKE', 'will', 'appreciate']",Gunsmoke- Return to Dodge VHS
326782,A3MQ3IIFGLQ2PO,6302662346,E. Hornaday,"[18, 18]","I applaud the release of any Gunsmoke-related production on DVD, including this 1987 made-for-TV reunion movie. Gunsmoke, the longest running western, or drama for that matter, in TV history, was complex and textured and dealt with mature themes with unforgettable characters that became part of our culture. I grew up watching the series, which debuted as a half-hour black and white show, then progressed to one hour and eventually was filmed in color.Gunsmoke richly deserves a serious DVD release of its episodes, not merely a release of a TV movie here or there.Few need to be told what his western depicted, it's the story of Marshall Matt Dillon (played to perfection by James Arness), who tamed the lawless Dodge City, Kansas, not only with his gun but with his courage, sense of honor, justice and irreproachable integrity behind the badge.Along the way, we meet Matt's friends, Kitty Russell (Amanda Blake), owner of the Longbranch Saloon and Matt's long-time love, Doc Adams (Milburn Stone, and Deputy Chester Goode (Dennis Weaver) and later Deputies Festus Hagen (Ken Curtis) and Newly O'Brien (Buck Taylor.) Weekly guest stars represented the cream of the acting crop for decades!While this TV-Movie reunites Arness, Blake and Taylor, much of the familiar Dodge landscape has changed: Matt has retired and lives as a mountaineer and O'Brien is Marshall. The plot centers around a continuation of a much earlier TV episode, with guest star Steve Forrest reprising his role as the villianous Will Mannon, whom Dillon had previously stopped and arrested.Now released from prison, Mannon has returned to Dodge for revenge. He holds Miss Kitty hostage to lure the retired lawman back into town to die.A suspenseful story, Arness' portrayal of Dillon in this TV movie was much less familiar than the TV version, giving Dillon a driven, haunted, almost tragic appearance of a man who had left -- or lost -- everything he had ever cared about. THis is definitely a different Matt Dillon.The TV movie weaves clips from the episode on which it is based throughout the production.",5,A Good Start........,1077840000,"02 27, 2004",2004,2082,"['applaud', 'release', 'Gunsmoke-related', 'production', 'DVD', 'including', '1987', 'made-for-TV', 'reunion', 'movie', 'Gunsmoke', 'longest', 'running', 'western', 'drama', 'matter', 'TV', 'history', 'was', 'complex', 'textured', 'dealt', 'mature', 'themes', 'unforgettable', 'characters', 'became', 'part', 'culture', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'series', 'debuted', 'half-hour', 'black', 'white', 'show', 'then', 'progressed', 'one', 'hour', 'eventually', 'was', 'filmed', 'color.Gunsmoke', 'richly', 'serious', 'DVD', 'release', 'episodes', 'not', 'merely', 'release', 'TV', 'movie', 'here', 'there.Few', 'need', 'be', 'told', 'what', 'western', 'depicted', 'story', 'Marshall', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'played', 'perfection', 'James', 'Arness', 'who', 'tamed', 'lawless', 'Dodge', 'City', 'Kansas', 'not', 'only', 'gun', 'courage', 'sense', 'honor', 'justice', 'irreproachable', 'integrity', 'badge.Along', 'way', 'meet', 'Matt', 'friends', 'Kitty', 'Russell', 'Amanda', 'Blake', 'owner', 'Longbranch', 'Saloon', 'Matt', 'long-time', 'love', 'Doc', 'Adams', 'Milburn', 'Stone', 'Deputy', 'Chester', 'Goode', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'later', 'Deputies', 'Festus', 'Hagen', 'Ken', 'Curtis', 'Newly', ""O'Brien"", 'Buck', 'Taylor', 'Weekly', 'guest', 'stars', 'represented', 'cream', 'acting', 'crop', 'decades', 'TV-Movie', 'Arness', 'Blake', 'Taylor', 'much', 'familiar', 'Dodge', 'landscape', 'changed', 'Matt', 'retired', 'mountaineer', ""O'Brien"", 'Marshall', 'plot', 'centers', 'continuation', 'much', 'earlier', 'TV', 'episode', 'guest', 'star', 'Steve', 'Forrest', 'reprising', 'role', 'villianous', 'Will', 'Mannon', 'whom', 'Dillon', 'had', 'previously', 'stopped', 'arrested.Now', 'released', 'prison', 'Mannon', 'returned', 'Dodge', 'revenge', 'Miss', 'Kitty', 'hostage', 'lure', 'retired', 'lawman', 'back', 'town', 'die.A', 'suspenseful', 'story', 'Arness', 'portrayal', 'Dillon', 'TV', 'movie', 'was', 'much', 'less', 'familiar', 'TV', 'version', 'giving', 'Dillon', 'driven', 'haunted', 'almost', 'tragic', 'appearance', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'left', 'lost', 'everything', 'had', 'ever', 'cared', 'about', 'THis', 'definitely', 'different', 'Matt', 'Dillon.The', 'TV', 'movie', 'weaves', 'clips', 'episode', 'based', 'production']",Gunsmoke- Return to Dodge VHS
326783,A7Y6AVS576M03,6302662346,gobirds2,"[1, 1]","I thought this was an excellent made for TV movie of the legendary Gunsmoke western series. This movie has two storylines going simultaneously, which is a bit of a distraction. We see Matt Dillon (James Arness) going on a search for a friend (Earl Holliman) who escaped prison and return him. Back in Doge City, where Newly (Buck Taylor) is now marshal, Will Mannon (Steve Forrest) who was released from the same prison returns to find Matt Dillon for reasons of vengeance and this picks up directly from the episode titled ""Mannon."" Much of the movie concerns Matt Dillon's search in beautifully photographed mountain territory, but this part of the story and dialogue is rather weak. Steve Forrest in the dark character of Mannon brilliantly plays out the best part of this movie and is its strength. Amanda Blake as Kitty has also returned to Doge and her story is also connected to the original episode. There are many flashbacks that include Ken Curtis as Festus and Milburn Stone as Doc Adams. The true confrontation is between Steve Forrest and Amanda Blake and these scenes are very memorable and give us insight into the relationship of Matt Dillon and Kitty. It is a bittersweet tale to be sure, but very much worth seeing if you loved the Gunsmoke series.

I think Kitty appeared a little too frail and, as I recall, she was struck by a  bad guy and this was really not a good thing to see.  The ending was sparse of emotion and closure, really, the Marshall walks off down the street and Kitty's tearing up while watching him go away.  Really, they're adults here, he could have gone back up to the room and said some kind of proper good-bye.  That ending was disappointing, and abrupt after all the effort during the past hour and a half to get the bad guy.  Well, I don't think I will buy any more movies, just stick to the series DVD's.

326785,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,6302662346,Israel Drazin,"[1, 1]","This film, with several aged and wrinkled actors along with younger ones, draws in part on an early episode of the Gunsmoke TV series in which a gunslinger is captured by Marshal Matt Dillon, sentenced by a judge, and sent to prison. The outlaw is released from prison after serving his sentence but, before he leaves, tells another inmate, a friend of Matt, that he intends to kill Matt, who is no longer a marshal. This other prisoner escapes prison because he wants to warn Matt and is chased by a young inexperienced army lieutenant and several bounty hunters. The gunslinger kills the prison warden and the judge who sentenced him. He comes to Dodge looking to murder Matt. While in Dodge, he beats up Kitty, which is probably a euphemism for rape, and recalls that he did the same thing to Kitty before he went to prison. Matt hears about the gunslinger being in Dodge and comes to confront him.The story line, acting, and action are good. Despite their age, the actors act with vigor. There are several subplots that add interest. These include the escaped prisoner being suspected for the murder of the warden, rather than the gunslinger; the unusual (sexual?) relationship between Matt and Kitty and Matt's inability to satisfy Kitty, he only wants to be friends; a budding romance between the lieutenant and the escaped prisoner's daughter; the kidnapping of the escaped prisoner's wife; and several gun fights.",5,An excellent film returning well-liked actors in an exciting adventure,1291248000,"12 2, 2010",2010,1421,"['film', 'several', 'aged', 'wrinkled', 'actors', 'younger', 'ones', 'draws', 'part', 'early', 'episode', 'Gunsmoke', 'TV', 'series', 'gunslinger', 'captured', 'Marshal', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'sentenced', 'judge', 'sent', 'prison', 'outlaw', 'released', 'prison', 'serving', 'sentence', 'inmate', 'friend', 'Matt', 'kill', 'Matt', 'who', 'no', 'longer', 'marshal', 'other', 'prisoner', 'escapes', 'prison', 'warn', 'Matt', 'chased', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'army', 'lieutenant', 'several', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'gunslinger', 'prison', 'warden', 'judge', 'who', 'sentenced', 'Dodge', 'looking', 'murder', 'Matt', 'Dodge', 'up', 'Kitty', 'probably', 'euphemism', 'rape', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'Kitty', 'went', 'prison', 'Matt', 'gunslinger', 'being', 'Dodge', 'confront', 'him.The', 'story', 'line', 'acting', 'action', 'are', 'good', 'age', 'actors', 'act', 'vigor', 'are', 'several', 'subplots', 'add', 'interest', 'include', 'escaped', 'prisoner', 'being', 'suspected', 'murder', 'warden', 'rather', 'gunslinger', 'unusual', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'Matt', 'Kitty', 'Matt', 'inability', 'satisfy', 'Kitty', 'only', 'be', 'friends', 'budding', 'romance', 'lieutenant', 'escaped', 'prisoner', 'daughter', 'kidnapping', 'escaped', 'prisoner', 'wife', 'several', 'gun', 'fights']",Gunsmoke- Return to Dodge VHS

When this movie came out I was a little skeptical at first about buying it since most movies that are based on a TV show that was as successful and legendary as Gunsmoke aren't usually all that great, but being the Gunsmoke fan that I am, I purchased it anyway. I'm glad I did. This is a great movie. James Arness, Amanda Blake, Buck Taylor and Steve Forrest all played thier former charactors extremely well. This movie made me feel like I was watching the show again, even to the point where it even ended like the shows did with Matt Dillon walking down Front Street after all was done.There are great flashbacks featuring the show in which the movie is based and it really does help the viewer get into the movie a little better.Now the biggest thing that most will notice are two things: The way James Arness and Amanda Blake aged, they did not age well at all especially James Arness. Another thing most will notice is that Dodge City isn't the same as it was in the show. Yes the setting of the town is simular but you can see the big difference on Dodge City in this movie and way back on the Show.All in all the viewer will not be disapointed.

I forget exactly when it was & how many I saw, but I know it was during the B&W; era - I never saw any of the color programs till this year when I was able to purchase the whole 20-year selection of TV programming & 5 films online (""iOffer"") on DVD at a reasonable price. What a journey - seeing young-lookng 32 year-old James Arness as Matt in the initial program ('55) introduced by John Wayne just getting his feet wet as Marshall of Dodge City & then watching him mature over the years till when it ended in '75. He was 52 years old. When the film ""Return To Dodge"" was issued ('87), Arness was 64 & looked old beond his years. When the last of the 5 films was released in '94, Arness was in his 71st year - & looked much older. I have to wonder if there is any other film record of an actor aging from a young person to very old as there is in these series of films. Matt Dillon was distinguished by his uncompromising virtues - honesty, integrity, justice, etc. It's amazing that, in an age when TV programming & movies have become so saturated with needless profanity, not one word of such ever escaped the lips of any Gunsmoke character that I know of. Gunsmoke stories were almost always of very high caliber. There were times in watching the TV progamming I shook my fist in frustration at what I considered scriptwriting that took undue liberties, but realizing I could write to no one at this juncture - the program was no longer running (that was a hard thing to accept) & most everyone concerned was dead. The only episodes I considered below the quality level of normal Gunsmoke TV programming were some of the comic ones such as those involving Festus' relatives. It bothered me something fierce when the quality level dropped & I would say to myself, ""Nuts, I'm no 'Beverly Hillbillies' fan & I don't expect other Gumsmoke viewers are either."" But who could I complain to?Ah, forgive me for going on & on. Others here have discussed this ""Return To Dodge"" film adequately so I thought I would just bend a few ears so to speak.
