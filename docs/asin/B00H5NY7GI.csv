1683720,A3M4C2VDWYJSSA,B00H5NY7GI,Compusurge,"[6, 7]","Shelter Island is the heart-warming true story of Shelter Island, NY outsider artist Harald Olson and his passionate patron, Jimmy Olinkiewicz, a gas station owner and father of an Autistic child. The film is an inspirational buddy story that shows how two men, from disparate walks of life can together accomplish an incredible feat; taking an unknown artist from showings alongside a country fence to a major showing in Manhattan art gallery. The film is about kindness, commitment, friendship and inspiration; a small tale with a great big universal story of compassion.PS: Olson's art is incredible.",5,Heart-warming and inspirational,1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,603,"['Shelter', 'Island', 'heart-warming', 'true', 'story', 'Shelter', 'Island', 'NY', 'outsider', 'artist', 'Harald', 'Olson', 'passionate', 'patron', 'Jimmy', 'Olinkiewicz', 'gas', 'station', 'owner', 'father', 'Autistic', 'child', 'film', 'inspirational', 'buddy', 'story', 'how', 'two', 'men', 'disparate', 'walks', 'life', 'can', 'together', 'accomplish', 'incredible', 'feat', 'taking', 'unknown', 'artist', 'showings', 'country', 'fence', 'major', 'showing', 'Manhattan', 'art', 'gallery', 'film', 'kindness', 'commitment', 'friendship', 'inspiration', 'small', 'tale', 'great', 'big', 'universal', 'story', 'compassion.PS', 'Olson', 'art', 'incredible']",Shelter Island

I was surprised and delighted to find out that while the island itself plays a part in this film, the real joy is watching the developing friendship between the two most unlikely of characters: semi-homeless outsider artist Harald and gas station-owner cum ebay entrepreneur and house builder Jimmy, supplemented by Jimmy's autistic son Alex (a YouTube star in his own right).It's an uplifting, feel good doc that will appeal to people who want some insight into how a nobody artist can become a somebody artist with Manhattan gallery shows; to people who have autistic family members or friends; and to anyone who is interested in the essential goodness of the human condition. Highly recommended.",5,Shelter Island is AMAZING,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,854,"['thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'cute', 'little', 'movie', 'life', 'Shelter', 'Island', 'NY', 'beautiful', 'place', 'doubt', 'worthy', 'own', 'documentary', 'was', 'surprised', 'delighted', 'find', 'out', 'island', 'part', 'film', 'real', 'joy', 'watching', 'developing', 'friendship', 'two', 'most', 'unlikely', 'characters', 'semi-homeless', 'outsider', 'artist', 'Harald', 'gas', 'station-owner', 'cum', 'ebay', 'entrepreneur', 'house', 'builder', 'Jimmy', 'supplemented', 'Jimmy', 'autistic', 'son', 'Alex', 'YouTube', 'star', 'own', 'right', '.It', 'uplifting', 'feel', 'good', 'doc', 'will', 'appeal', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'insight', 'how', 'nobody', 'artist', 'can', 'become', 'somebody', 'artist', 'Manhattan', 'gallery', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'autistic', 'family', 'members', 'friends', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'essential', 'goodness', 'human', 'condition', 'Highly', 'recommended']",Shelter Island

He lives on Shelter Island, which is east of Long Island, where I grew up.  He continues to paint and enjoy some success, thanks to his friend and patron Jimmy, a local businessman with an equally interesting Aspie son who arranges the products in his father's convenience store alphabetically.The film follows Harald in his daily life of trolling the recycling station for discarded canvases and paint, doing yoga and lifting weights, smoking cigars, bicycling around town, and preparing for his first exhibit in Manhattan.
