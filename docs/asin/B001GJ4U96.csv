1196851,A37T4NN3DV3U75,B001GJ4U96,Amazon Customer,"[2, 3]","We got this movie for our little girl and hoped it would be good for adults.  It was neither.First off the animations would have been amazing had they come out 20 years ago.  By today's standards they were terrible.  The movement was clunky, stiff, and not fluid at all.  The facial animations while a little better were not better by much.Along with the animations, the lack of detail for the characters was just as bad and made the poor animations look that much worse.  Unlike any other good cartoons like Pixar movies and Shrek, never once did I feel in awe of the picture.To add insult to injury, the movie abused the 3D effects as much as they possibly could.  It was as if each screen was intended not to tell the story or advance the plot but rather to freak out the audience using the 3D features.  Not only is this lame but it absolutely ruins the movie when NOT watching it in 3D.  It was almost like being on a cheap ride at a theme park at points.Story was as bad as the rest.  It was not interesting, believable, or entertaining.  Now kids movies do not have to be believable but at the very least should have some shred of truth to it.  Not this movie.  Nor did the challenges really make sense or engage me as a viewer.  I guess this movie was geared towards small children but then again my daughter hated it too.Characters were bad too.  None had any real depth and never gave you much of a reason to care about any of them.Overall I wish I could have given it less stars.  It was almost as if they said hey lets just make a movie about being 3D and then fill in the other details later.  I would only recommend this movie to somebody that is in need for punishment.",1,Horrible,1248912000,"07 30, 2009",2009,1684,"['got', 'movie', 'little', 'girl', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'adults', 'was', 'neither.First', 'animations', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'amazing', 'had', 'come', 'out', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'today', 'standards', 'were', 'terrible', 'movement', 'was', 'clunky', 'stiff', 'not', 'fluid', 'facial', 'animations', 'little', 'better', 'were', 'not', 'better', 'much.Along', 'animations', 'lack', 'detail', 'characters', 'was', 'just', 'bad', 'made', 'poor', 'animations', 'look', 'much', 'worse', 'other', 'good', 'cartoons', 'Pixar', 'movies', 'Shrek', 'never', 'once', 'did', 'feel', 'awe', 'picture.To', 'insult', 'injury', 'movie', 'abused', '3D', 'effects', 'as', 'much', 'possibly', 'could', 'was', 'screen', 'was', 'intended', 'not', 'tell', 'story', 'advance', 'plot', 'rather', 'freak', 'out', 'audience', 'using', '3D', 'features', 'Not', 'only', 'lame', 'absolutely', 'movie', 'when', 'NOT', 'watching', '3D', 'was', 'almost', 'being', 'cheap', 'ride', 'theme', 'park', 'points.Story', 'was', 'as', 'bad', 'rest', 'was', 'not', 'interesting', 'believable', 'entertaining', 'Now', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'believable', 'very', 'least', 'should', 'have', 'shred', 'truth', 'Not', 'movie', 'did', 'challenges', 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'engage', 'viewer', 'guess', 'movie', 'was', 'geared', 'small', 'children', 'then', 'again', 'daughter', 'hated', 'too.Characters', 'were', 'bad', 'too', 'None', 'had', 'real', 'depth', 'never', 'gave', 'much', 'reason', 'care', 'them.Overall', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'less', 'stars', 'was', 'almost', 'said', 'hey', 'lets', 'just', 'make', 'movie', 'being', '3D', 'then', 'fill', 'other', 'details', 'later', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'movie', 'somebody', 'need', 'punishment']",Fly Me to the Moon

1196854,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001GJ4U96,Chris Pandolfi,"[1, 2]","You find yourself using the word ""cute"" to describe a lot of ""Fly Me to the Moon."" The basic story of three young flies hitching a ride on the moon is cute. Most of the characters are pretty cute, each with big, soulful eyes and tiny hands and round heads. The general innocence of the film itself is pretty cute, as is the fact that it's presented in 3-D. The thing is, cute can only get you so far. This is the third animated film of the summer to involve non-human characters in space (the first two being ""WALL-E"" and ""Space Chimps""), and of those three, ""Fly Me to the Moon"" is definitely the least challenging and the least entertaining. It has its moments of fun, and I have no doubt young kids will get a kick out of it. But for most people, it's really no better or worse than an extended episode of an early morning kids show. Some may even be bothered by its Cold War mentality, where Americans are fearless and heroic while Russians are vile and sinister.The story proper takes place in 1969, just as Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, and Michael Collins were about to make history on Apollo 11's mission to the moon. In a swampy junkyard just outside of Cape Canaveral, three school-age flies decide to stow away on the mission and become the first flies in outer space. The leader, Nat (voiced by Trevor Gagnon), is the headstrong, adventurous one. The brains of the group is naturally named I.Q. (voiced by Philip Bolden), and you know he's smart because he's the only one wearing glasses. Scooter (voiced by David Gore) is the fat, timid one, and nothing other than food is on his mind. Already, you might have noticed that all three sound like virtual clones of our favorite chipmunks, Alvin, Simon, and Theodore; it may not matter a great deal, but I have a feeling many of the adults in the audience will get the feeling they've seen these characters before.After a discussion with his equally adventurous grandfather (voiced by Christopher Lloyd), Nat, I.Q., and Scooter sneak into Cape Canaveral on the morning of the launch. Once inside the rocket, they hide themselves inside each astronaut's helmet. The constant media coverage allows everyone in Nat's world to see him and his friends go into orbit, including Nat's mother (voiced by Kelly Ripa), a worrisome woman who constantly faints. She doesn't see eye to eye with her father, always filling his grandson's head with fantastical stories of real life adventures. One of Grandpa's most popular stories is of how he was with Amelia Earhart during her solo transatlantic flight; he actually had to fly up her nose to keep her from falling asleep. We actually see this happening as a flashback sequence, and it culminates with a lovely shot of Earhart sneezing Nat's grandfather out her nose.Our three friends, meanwhile, are having their own adventure on their way to the moon. Little do they realize that, back on Earth, a small group of Russian flies are devising a plan to steal credit for the space mission away from the Americans. The team leader, named Poopchev (voiced by Ed Begley, Jr.), sends a spy named Yegor (voiced by Tim Curry) to infiltrate Cape Canaveral's control center and alter Apollo 11's landing coordinates. Will the Russians succeed, or will America's indomitable spirit conquer all that threatens democracy? If you actually have to think that one over, (a) you don't know how the Apollo 11 mission ended, and (b) you don't see very many kid's movies. Not that it matters a great deal; the very idea of a kid's movie reverting to Cold War prejudices is not at all appealing. The Russian characters in ""Fly Me to the Moon"" are ugly, vile, and stupid, perfect fodder for animated villains. Shouldn't we have gone beyond this by now?The only Russian character made to look pretty is Nadia (voiced by Nicollette Sheridan), who Nat's grandfather met in France after Amelia Earhart's flight. After years of being apart, Nadia defects from her country to help Grandpa save the Apollo mission, which in turn would save his grandson. Why the filmmakers felt the need to include this character or even this subplot, I have no idea. What rule states that all animated films need heroes and villains? Why do they all need that kind of conflict? It seemed that Nat, I.Q., and Scooter's mission in space was already full of conflict, especially when the astronauts realized they had flies on board.At a certain point in the movie, the real Buzz Aldrin appears to make what can only be described as a public service announcement. Yes, it was cute that he decided to play along. But really, was that necessary? Don't we already know that the men and women of NASA are brave people that have opened doors? And what does any of that have to do with flies? The animation and 3-D effects of ""Fly Me to the Moon"" were decent enough. I distinctly remember two scenes: one featured Nat, I.Q., and Scooter doing a zero-gravity synchronized dance to the tune of ""The Blue Danube""; the other was a recreation of Neil Armstrong's first step on the lunar surface. Both were wonderful to look at--the latter was oddly beautiful, in a childish sort of way. But for everything the film achieved visually, the story needed a lot of work. It needed to be less cutesy and more entertaining. It needed fewer clich&eacute;d characters. It needed to be less preachy with its patriotism. You leave this movie knowing that if the filmmakers had tried a little harder, they would have had something that could appeal to everyone, not just to kids.",3,Three Bugs in a Space

The color is almost non-existent and what color is there is completely off. The Maggot babies are lime green where as in the 2 D version they're pink-ish. If fact most anything with color is lime green and the rest looks like a black and white film or the color is so subtle you have to strain to see what color it is...... it's too distracting and it looks awful!Also, there is the typical double vision effect which wouldn't be so bad if the color was right.

1196861,AHF97M45JFCB,B001GJ4U96,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","A few years ago space themed computer generated movies were all the rage.  Space Chimps (and Space Chimps 2), Wall-E, Mars Needs Moms, Planet 51, Fly Me to the Moon; rockets, space travel, you really couldn't go wrong.Fly Me to the Moon had all of the makings of a blockbuster hit: A pretty decent budget of $25-mil, a solid vocal cast, a US & Canadian theatrical release including IMAX, and believe it or not, so scientifically solid was the piece that it arrived to theme parks the world over as an attraction (the film was shown minus a subplot involving Russian flies trying to sabotage the US space mission) and as the inspiration behind a 13-minute ride at several Six Flags locations!Sadly what all of this does not reveal is that the film itself feels fairly flat and uninspired despite some real attempts at Pixar-level creativity scattered about.  But we'll get to all that, let's take a look at the facts first.Fly Me to the Moon was released theatrically in January of 2008 and came to DVD the following December as both a 2D and 3D release (but not modern 3D mind you, think blue and red lensed paper framed glasses style- of which 2 pairs are included in the 3D DVD release).  It comes in at a runtime of 85-minutes and wears a G (general audience) rating.  Having raked in over $41-million, it is considered a commercial success despite being considered a critical failure.  It also boasts the distinction of being the first animated feature film designed for 3D (DreamWorks would later run with this concept through a series of shorts involving its marquee characters from the Shrek and Monsters Vs. Aliens franchises).Written by Domonic Paris and directed by Ben Stassen, the film involves a threesome of Floridian houseflies stowing away on the iconic Apollo 11 moon mission.  To be honest when the film opens, the viewer almost gets the feeling they're in for a slightly more sophisticated incarnation of Space Chimps with characters copied and pasted from A Bug's Life but as the film wears on, it becomes clear that what I just described would be far more enjoyable than what's actually there.  The three main characters are typical kid archetypes from just about any children's movie: Nat (Trevor Gagnon), who admires his grandpa's (Christopher Lloyd) war stories, the brainy one IQ (Philip Bolden) and the fat, lazy one Scooter (David Gore).  The trio constructs a small rocket out of junk they collected but Nat convinces the gang that the only way to get to the moon would be to hitch a ride on the Apollo 11, which just so happens to be about to launch from nearby Cape Canaveral.As much as I'd like to tell you that my summary there omits all of the character and charm that makes computer generated features so enduring, the fact of the matter is that's really it- just like that.  The rest of the film consists only of unnecessary dialog segments, a weak subplot whereby some jealous Russian flies get word of the US being the first to put man (and flies) on the moon and do their best to sabotage things and a fight sequence that fails to create any sense of tension.  In fact the film's greatest weakness (aside from a complete lack of comic relief) could be its absence of conflict from which to advance the plot.  Rather than create a situation that holds the viewer's attention because they absolutely must know how things will resolve, what you get here is essentially a succession of set-ups that pay-off with iconic images of the first man to walk on the moon.  It's a lot like watching archival footage of the actual mission with a few cute little bugs drawn in the corner of the frames.  Sure it's important stuff for its historical impact but not exactly riveting entertainment.Additionally the flies themselves become a bit of a tough sell because unlike other (much better developed) bug flicks like A Bug's Life, Antz or The Bee Movie, you have some cartoony critters (the flies) mixed with near photo-realistic and scientifically accurate renderings of other insects (like a spider for example).  Plus it's never made clear if the humans in the film are able to hear/ understand the pint sized adventurers as there is a scene that makes reference to the fact that they may be able to but it never provides evidence conclusively.  It sounds silly, sure but let's be honest here: Had Neil Armstrong discovered an English-speaking housefly in a tiny spacesuit on his shoulder at Mission Control, it's possible the whole moon mission would have taken the back seat to this discovery!  In case you think I'm picking nits here, do keep in mind that Buzz Aldrin himself makes an appearance at the film's conclusion to remind viewers that no flies were actually present during the Apollo 11 mission.  So much for suspension of disbelief.All in all, the film doesn't commit major crimes so much as it simply doesn't do anything to make it worth recommending.  Its main appeal surely lies in the fact that's nearly scientifically accurate to teach the younger kids about the actual Apollo 11 mission and space travel in general.  Of course the down side is that what has been created by the movie for entertainment's sake is either abrasive (Russia can't be too happy with their representation here) or inaccurate to the point that a real astronaut has to come on and tell us that it didn't happen... In other words, use it as a teaching tool at your own discretion.Finally there's the 3D gimmick to consider.  Yes the illusion that junk is popping off the screen is preserved fairly well here but that is assuming you are one of the individuals willing and able to wear the included 3D glasses for the duration of the film because to everyone else in the room, the colors and textures are going to look terrible.  Of course the DVD menu does offer the option of running it in the much more watchable 2D presentation hence making the 3D gimmick rather useless as a whole.Recommended as a rental if all the top tier CG pieces you've been looking for are unavailable.",3,Ambitious Effort That Fails to Fully Launch,1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,5999,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'space', 'themed', 'computer',

1196866,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B001GJ4U96,Spider Monkey,"[0, 0]","`Fly Me to the Moon' is a pretty average animation about three flies who stow away on the Apollo 11 mission and make their way to the moon. There are lots of `in-jokes' if you are aware of the original mission and Buzz Aldrin even appears at the end to say a brief message. The animation is pretty basic, with under par character animation, although saying that some of the weightless scenes were better than expected. The story is simple and nothing too great, but for an 80 minute animation to keep the kids entertained this should do the job well enough. There's not too much for an adult audience though. Compared to some other animations out there (I.e. nearly everything from Pixar!) this lacks a certain something, but in it's own right it is a perfectly watchable film.
