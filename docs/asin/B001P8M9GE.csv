1226021,A9KAY47NCPQS,B001P8M9GE,"Beatrice Izzey ""Nanny Dog""","[0, 3]","Garrison Keillor has the most sonorous, soporific, sexy voice on the radio.  So it was shocking to me to see how homely he is as a person.  He almost looks mentally deficient.  Just hopelessly ugly at first glance.  What a gangly dowdy person.  Plus, he never laughs.But then it struck me all the more as to how far he got in life.  It was pure effort and talent.  The documentary shows him tapping away at his laptop on the plane, backstage, at home... he writes his own shows.  He is the mastermind, he is not just an actor.This documentary juxtaposes Keillor's dual life in Minnesota and his life in Manhattan.  Victorian mansion to Central Park West co-op.  Family man to his entertainer persona.  Humble to haughty.  I saw instantly that his radio persona is a total artifice though based in germs of original truth.Good to watch after his atypical novel, Love Me, which is a self-parody of the dowdy Minnesotan who moves to the Big City to pursue unfettered sexual adventures and the glamorous life but ultimately goes back to his loyal long term Midwestern wife.",5,Nice to see how such a homely person got so far in life,1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,1069,"['Garrison', 'Keillor', 'most', 'sonorous', 'soporific', 'sexy', 'voice', 'radio', 'was', 'shocking', 'see', 'how', 'homely', 'person', 'almost', 'mentally', 'deficient', 'Just', 'hopelessly', 'ugly', 'first', 'glance', 'What', 'gangly', 'dowdy', 'person', 'never', 'laughs.But', 'then', 'struck', 'more', 'how', 'far', 'got', 'life', 'was', 'pure', 'effort', 'talent', 'documentary', 'tapping', 'away', 'laptop', 'plane', 'backstage', 'home', 'own', 'shows', 'mastermind', 'not', 'just', 'actor.This', 'documentary', 'juxtaposes', 'Keillor', 'dual', 'life', 'Minnesota', 'life', 'Manhattan', 'Victorian', 'mansion', 'Central', 'Park', 'West', 'co-op', 'Family', 'man', 'entertainer', 'persona', 'Humble', 'haughty', 'saw', 'instantly', 'radio', 'persona', 'total', 'artifice', 'based', 'germs', 'original', 'truth.Good', 'watch', 'atypical', 'novel', 'Love', 'Me', 'self-parody', 'dowdy', 'Minnesotan', 'who', 'Big', 'City', 'pursue', 'unfettered', 'sexual', 'adventures', 'glamorous', 'life', 'ultimately', 'back', 'loyal', 'long', 'term', 'Midwestern', 'wife']",Garrison Keillor: The Man on the Radio in the Red Shoes

I never listened to their show or even saw APHC, but I did follow Paul Harvey for years and can understand the draw this kind of entertainment has.This latest documentary covers the span of time before and after that live show in the Minnesota rain a couple years ago. After hearing and seeing his artistic process, I feel compelled to write very little after visualizing a great writer like him. This is a must see for his fan base and I feel they will get a worthwhile product containing plenty of snippets about Minnesota, about how things used to be in the radio industry, Keillor's random thoughts, unscripted interviews and above all - rhubarb.The supplements contain some redone footage from the Prairie Home Companion release, outtakes of a sort and a few other items that make this a solid purchase, even for someone that knew little of him prior to this viewing. The overall title has a slight introspective feel to it, that I think maybe caters to the crowd looking for something in themselves, over finding it in some random semi-fictional tripe.
