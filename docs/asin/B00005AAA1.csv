I suppose this is important historically speaking, but it is very racist. It's propoganda, and not against the enemy, but against out own people. This is the type of work that allowed us to have our deterrment camps. On the plus side, Huston, who plays Uncle Sam, does argue that they are Japanese-Americans are as American and as loyal as any other. But we have Mr. C., which is U.S.'s conscience telling us different. I'd like to think that the rational side won the arguement in the film, but we know from history it didn't.

576377,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B00005AAA1,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[6, 7]","This DVD contains two documentaries. The first is John Ford's film about the attack on Pearl Harbor.  I had mixed views about this film.  I thought the original scenes from the attack were very interesting, and there were some scenes which I've never seen before.  However, the scenes which included the plastic models were very poorly done.  I realize this film was made over fifty years ago, but I was still disappointed with the poor use of the replicas of the American battleships.  It was very easy to tell that they were not real.The second documentary on this DVD was much better.  It deals with the kamikaze attacks against the American fleet off Okinawa.  The footage in this documentary is all actual.  The viewer gets a true sense of what it was like to fight against an enemy fully intent on diving their plane into an American ship.  The skies were literally full of anti-aircraft shells, yet the kamikazes kept on coming.  Most never made it to their targets, but some did manage to break through, but thanks to the heroic efforts of the ships' crews, most of the ships were operational after the attack.  However, some ships, such as the USS Franklin, suffered a much worse fate.Overall,I gave this DVD 4 stars; the Pearl Harbor documentary gets 3, while the Okinawa documentary gets 5. Some parts of the Pearl Harbor documentary were very interesting, but I thought the poor use of the models greatly detracted from the overall quality of the film.  On the other hand, the Okinawa film was excellent.  The footage is all authentic, and the viewer gets a real sense of what it was like to be in a kamikaze attack.I recommend this video highly.  Both documentaries describe two important parts of World War II; one at the beginning of the war, and one at the end. Watch this video and see what it was like to fight the Japanese attackers at Pearl Harbor and survive a kamikaze attack in the waters off Okinawa.",4,Two Good Documentaries on One DVD,1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,1924,"['DVD', 'two', 'documentaries', 'first', 'John', 'Ford', 'film', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'had', 'mixed', 'views', 'film', 'thought', 'original', 'scenes', 'attack', 'were', 'very', 'interesting', 'were', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'However', 'scenes', 'included', 'plastic', 'models', 'were', 'very', 'poorly', 'done', 'realize', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'still', 'disappointed', 'poor', 'use', 'replicas', 'American', 'battleships', 'was', 'very', 'easy', 'tell', 'were', 'not', 'real.The', 'second', 'documentary', 'DVD', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'kamikaze', 'attacks', 'American', 'fleet', 'Okinawa', 'footage', 'documentary', 'actual', 'viewer', 'true', 'sense', 'what', 'was', 'fight', 'enemy', 'fully', 'intent', 'diving', 'plane', 'American', 'ship', 'skies', 'were', 'literally', 'full', 'anti-aircraft', 'shells', 'yet', 'kamikazes', 'kept', 'coming', 'Most', 'never', 'made', 'targets', 'did', 'manage', 'break', 'thanks', 'heroic', 'efforts', 'ships', 'crews', 'most', 'ships', 'were', 'operational', 'attack', 'However', 'ships', 'such', 'USS', 'Franklin', 'suffered', 'much', 'worse', 'fate.Overall', 'gave', 'DVD', '4', 'stars', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'documentary', '3', 'Okinawa', 'documentary', '5', 'parts', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'documentary', 'were', 'very', 'interesting', 'thought', 'poor', 'use', 'models', 'greatly', 'detracted', 'overall', 'quality', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'Okinawa', 'film', 'was', 'excellent', 'footage', 'authentic', 'viewer', 'real', 'sense', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'kamikaze', 'attack.I', 'recommend', 'video', 'highly', 'documentaries', 'describe', 'two', 'important', 'parts', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'one', 'beginning', 'war', 'one', 'end', 'Watch', 'video', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'fight', 'Japanese', 'attackers', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'survive', 'kamikaze', 'attack', 'waters', 'off', 'Okinawa']",December 7th: The Pearl Harbor Story

576381,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B00005AAA1,The Mysterious Traveler,"[3, 5]","So I FINALLY got to see this long lost banned John Ford film DEC 7 (1943) starring Walter Huston, Harry Davenport and Dana Andrews.For a long time only a 35 minutes version(cut from the full length 82 min version was available) but now the uncut version has finally broke free of Liberal censorship.  The history always was that the FDR administration hated the film and, like modern libs have done with the miniseries AMERIKA and PATH TO 9/11, forced its censoring.  And one can see why. The film is VERY critical of the Democrat Party's internment of Japanese Americans as well as the lax security measures that led to Pearl Harbor. This was the material that was removed leaving just a recreation of the Pearl Harbor attack.One would like to say that it is a lost masterpiece but rather what it is is the damndest thing I have ever seen. Stylistically it is ALL over the place.  Not really a documentary. Not quite a drama.  The first half hour features Walter Huston as Uncle Sam and Harry Davenport as his conscience debating over what to do about Hawaii's large Japanese population.........a discussion incidentally that could be had exactly over what to do about America's Muslim population today!  This first section besides being just odd is also a nice travelogue of Hawaii in 1941. Then the film switches to the aforementioned......and very well done recreation of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Then it switches to a mini doc about Hawaii AFTER THE ATTACK and then more stuff about those Japanese Hawaians AND then a very odd sequence with Dana Andrews as a dead sailor in a cemetery talking to a dead WW1 vet about the glories of the United Nations and how America betrayed that ""great"" American Woodrow Wilson. Hearing anyone praise Wilson always makes my skin crawl and it is sick how Democrats think Wilson was ""betrayed"" as if his own rotten ugly administration was not responsible for the American people wisely rejecting his insanity.The film also has two out and out fibs. Dorry Miller--the famous Black sailor---was not killed at Pearl Harbor as shown here and the Second wave of Japanese planes was not ""beaten off"" as shown here. They came, plastered the place and then left when they ran out of bombs and ammo.Then the movie ends.Interesting.  Worth seeing.  But rather offputting and too long by half.The shorter version is actually superior. A rare example of censorship improving something.",2,Long banned film finally available,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,2415,"['So', 'FINALLY', 'got', 'see', 'long', 'lost', 'banned', 'John', 'Ford', 'film', 'DEC', '7', '1943', 'starring', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'Harry', 'Davenport', 'Dana', 'Andrews.For', 'long', 'time', 'only', '35', 'minutes', 'version', 'cut', 'full', 'length', '82', 'min', 'version', 'was', 'available', 'now', 'uncut', 'version', 'finally', 'broke', 'free', 'Liberal', 'censorship', 'history', 'always', 'was', 'FDR', 'administration', 'hated', 'film', 'modern', 'libs', 'have', 'done', 'miniseries', 'AMERIKA', 'PATH', 'TO', '9/11', 'forced', 'censoring', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'VERY', 'critical', 'Democrat', 'Party', 'internment', 'Japanese', 'Americans', 'as', 'well', 'lax', 'security', 'measures', 'led', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'was', 'material', 'was', 'removed', 'leaving', 'just', 'recreation', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'attack.One', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'lost', 'masterpiece', 'rather', 'what', 'damndest', 'thing', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Stylistically', 'place', 'Not', 'really', 'documentary', 'Not', 'quite', 'drama', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'features', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'Uncle', 'Sam', 'Harry', 'Davenport', 'conscience', 'debating', 'what', 'do', 'Hawaii', 'large', 'Japanese', 'population', 'discussion', 'incidentally', 'could', 'be', 'had', 'exactly', 'what', 'do', 'America', 'Muslim', 'population', 'today', 'first', 'section', 'being', 'just', 'odd', 'also', 'nice', 'travelogue', 'Hawaii', '1941', 'Then', 'film', 'switches', 'aforementioned', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'recreation', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Then', 'mini', 'doc', 'Hawaii', 'AFTER', 'THE', 'ATTACK', 'then', 'more', 'stuff', 'Japanese', 'Hawaians', 'AND', 'then', 'very', 'odd', 'sequence', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'dead', 'sailor', 'cemetery', 'talking', 'dead', 'WW1', 'vet', 'glories', 'United', 'Nations', 'how', 'America', 'betrayed', 'great', 'American', 'Woodrow', 'Wilson', 'Hearing', 'anyone', 'praise', 'Wilson', 'always', 'skin', 'crawl', 'sick', 'how', 'Democrats', 'think', 'Wilson', 'was', 'betrayed', 'own', 'rotten', 'ugly', 'administration', 'was', 'not', 'responsible', 'American', 'people', 'wisely', 'rejecting', 'insanity.The', 'film', 'also', 'two', 'fibs', 'Dorry', 'Miller', 'famous', 'Black', 'sailor', 'not', 'killed', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'shown', 'here', 'Second', 'wave', 'Japanese', 'planes', 'was', 'not', 'beaten', 'off', 'shown', 'here', 'came', 'plastered', 'place', 'then', 'left', 'when', 'ran', 'bombs', 'ammo.Then', 'movie', 'ends.Interesting', 'Worth', 'seeing', 'rather', 'offputting', 'too', 'long', 'half.The', 'shorter', 'version', 'actually', 'superior', 'rare', 'example', 'censorship', 'improving', 'something']",December 7th: The Pearl Harbor Story
