Years later images popped in my mind of this movie, but I had no idea what it was called and I wanted to see it again.  Internet searching provided me with the name and through ebay I purchased the DVD.  I could not believe how bad today this movie is (to an adult).  Horrible acting, horrible visuals, music, the list goes on.  I wish I could forget it. :)  This is definitly a cute movie and kids will love it, but beware if you are an adult.",1,OMG - from an adult perspective,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,500,"['When', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'saw', 'movie', 'loved', 'Years', 'later', 'images', 'popped', 'mind', 'movie', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'called', 'wanted', 'see', 'again', 'Internet', 'searching', 'provided', 'name', 'ebay', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'bad', 'today', 'movie', 'adult', 'Horrible', 'acting', 'horrible', 'visuals', 'music', 'list', 'wish', 'could', 'forget', 'definitly', 'cute', 'movie', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'beware', 'are', 'adult']",N/A

Estorga ""Country mouse stuck in the City""","[29, 29]","In response to the reviewers who rated this poorly because they didn't like it *as adults*, I would like to say: don't be an idiot, this movie is not INTENDED for adults, it is made for CHILDREN.  I can remember watching this over and over as a child, and I loved it; as a grown-up, yes, it's a little annoying, but I have such fond memories of watching it as a child, and the overall message is still really sweet.  And I can personally say that my own children love it.The basic plotline is that the main character's grandmother is dying, and our little heroine wants to save her by making her young, so she travels through her mirror to the land of Hugga to steal these magic fruits from the evil queen.  But ultimately the fruit won't save the beloved grandmother, and nothing can really make her young again, but we learn that LOVE can keep bonds strong even when a loved one is becoming more distant.There is also a lovely twist at the end of the movie, in regards to the mean aunt who wants to put Grandma ""out to pasture.""  :)Definitely a must-see movie.  This needs to come out on DVD!",5,This is NOT a movie for adults!  (duh?)

I watched it over and over when I was young.It's a lovely story about family and the ties that bind. Another reviewer said the gramdma was dying but that is incorrect. It's nothing so serious as that. The adult children in the family are trying to move Grandma to a retirement community and the Ginnie James character doesn't want her to go. She likes having grandma around and is very upset that she is being ""sent away"". In her grief she hugs one of her stuffed animals and this sends a signal to the Hugga Bunch! Ginnie sets off with her new friends in search of berries from the ""Young Berry"" tree so that she can give them to Grandma and make her young again.The moral of the story is one of love and family and the importance of family togetherness!Fantastic tale...movies like this aren't made any more.
