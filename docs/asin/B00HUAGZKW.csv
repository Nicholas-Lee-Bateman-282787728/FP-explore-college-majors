1691995,ALJ3EFM000AM8,B00HUAGZKW,anita joy delight,"[4, 6]","The DVD was received in the time frame expected and in good condition. More importantly, I am a fan of Peggy Cappy's. I love her gentle, respectful approach and the philosophy she articulates throughout her programs. She has a voice and a presence that are calming. I had previously seen this particular yoga program on public television. As a person who is aging, I am concerned about sustaining as much balance and strength as possible for as long as possible. This video has all of the hallmark Peggy Cappy characteristics and it demonstrates options for doing the yoga practice 1) the traditional way, or 2) standing with the support of a chair, or 3) seated. It's a program that is easy to implement at home.",5,Premier Aging and At Home Yoga Program,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,713,"['DVD', 'was', 'received', 'time', 'frame', 'expected', 'good', 'condition', 'More', 'importantly', 'am', 'fan', 'Peggy', 'Cappy', 'love', 'gentle', 'respectful', 'approach', 'philosophy', 'programs', 'voice', 'presence', 'are', 'calming', 'had', 'previously', 'seen', 'particular', 'yoga', 'program', 'public', 'television', 'person', 'who', 'aging', 'am', 'concerned', 'about', 'sustaining', 'as', 'much', 'balance', 'strength', 'possible', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'video', 'hallmark', 'Peggy', 'Cappy', 'characteristics', 'options', 'doing', 'yoga', 'practice', '1', 'traditional', 'way', '2', 'standing', 'support', 'chair', '3', 'seated', 'program', 'easy', 'implement', 'home']",Easy Yoga: The Secret to Strength and Balance with Peggy Cappy

I have been going to yoga classes at a local gym for a few months and my back is feeling better.  This is my at-home option.  I'm 68 and like knowing I'm doing something for my physical and mental health.  I always feel better when I do these sessions.  She is an excellent instructor and I appreciate that there are 2 others with her showing how to do it if you want a lighter or more difficult workout.,5,Great Experience,1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,461,"['just', 'good', 'stuff', 'people', 'who', 'appreciate', 'yoga', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'yoga', 'classes', 'local', 'gym', 'few', 'months', 'back', 'feeling', 'better', 'at-home', 'option', ""'m"", '68', 'knowing', ""'m"", 'doing', 'something', 'physical', 'mental', 'health', 'always', 'feel', 'better', 'when', 'do', 'sessions', 'excellent', 'instructor', 'appreciate', 'are', '2', 'others', 'showing', 'how', 'do', 'want', 'lighter', 'more', 'difficult', 'workout']",Easy Yoga: The Secret to Strength and Balance with Peggy Cappy
