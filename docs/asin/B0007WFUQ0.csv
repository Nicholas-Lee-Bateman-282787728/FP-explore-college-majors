892305,AK0CENM3LUM28,B0007WFUQ0,Amazon Customer,"[51, 60]","Salem Witch Trials / B0007WFUQ0I've been fascinated with the Salem Witch Trials since I wrote a paper on the topic for my first year American History class in college. Since then, I've collected a modest collection of books, articles, and papers on the subject. I'm hardly an expert, but I do know enough to be terribly disappointed in this newest addition to my Salem collection.First of all, this documentary is extremely short - certainly not long enough to justify a twenty dollar asking price. The ""50 minutes"" length also includes the long teasers that aired prior to and after commercial breaks, bringing the 'actual' length to much shorter than 50 minutes.Second, even accounting for this shortness, the content here is extremely shallow. I realize the History Channel is supposed to be approachable for everyone regardless of prior knowledge, but a detailed explanation that witches were persecuted because the Bible says not to allow a witch to live is unnecessary when a few mere sentences would have conveyed the same point, and the discussion comes across as a desperate attempt to eat up time for that magic 50 minute mark.Third: Being short and shallow makes for a bad documentary for an enthusiast like me, but not necessarily a bad documentary for, say, a classroom of high schoolers. However, here is where the documentary is most troubling for it is *extremely* inaccurate. Mere opinions and modern supposition are presented here as facts. Real facts which would undermine these opinions are kept hidden from the audience, in the interests of ""drama"".For example, the opinion is aired that perhaps the biggest impetus in stopping the Salem trials was that ""nontraditional"" people such as men were accused of being witches. The actual fact that, of the first three executions, three of the executed witches were men and that the trials still continued for months afterward before abating (or even losing steam!) is not mentioned, not even once. A newcomer to the topic would be left with the idea that naming men as witches was what caused the Salem trials to end, when nothing could be further from the truth.In the interest of accuracy, it would be far more fair to include that the apparent biggest impetus to ending the trials was the Dutch document undermining spectral evidence entirely and the subsequent dismantling of the court by the governor, but there is nothing said about this - presumably because sexism (male witches vs. female accusers) is a more 'sexy' topic than politics and theology. There is also mention of George Burroughs' famous recitation of the Lord's Prayer at the gallows which is presented as being some sort of ""turning point"" in the peoples' minds, again without mentioning that if it WAS a ""turning point"", the actual turning was only accomplished months later!Finally, the narrator also states unequivocally that there were ""no transcripts"" of the trial, and fails to temper this with the actual fact that copious notes were taken by several of the judges, many in near-transcript form! The fact that most (but not all) of the trials were recorded to history has been obscured in order to represent the much more interesting fiction that the whole event is supposedly surrounded by an impenetrable fog of mystery. This is dishonest and it is bad documentary technique, designed to entertain and titillate rather than inform.An admittedly minor gripe of mine is also that, of the four or five 'experts' interviewed, two of them are religion professors with apparently little or nothing to add on the topic. It's unclear as to why an event that is notable for historical and psychological implications is left to religionists to interpret, and it feels like the makers decided that it was necessary to sprinkle in some nice religion experts so that they couldn't be accused of being anti-religion. If so, this is an incredibly cowardly way to construct a documentary - focusing on averting potential criticism of your motives rather than giving the best possible presentation regardless. If this had been a 3 hour long documentary, I wouldn't have minded the token religion professors nearly as much, but as a 50 minute presentation, it was grating to watch time slip away to the 'expert' opinion that Puritanism was a rough religion to adhere to and that modern jus' folks wouldn't like it much.~ Ana Mardoll",1,Shallow and Misleading,1232409600,"01 20, 2009",2009,4360,"['Salem', 'Witch', 'Trials', '/', 'B0007WFUQ0I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fascinated', 'Salem', 'Witch', 'Trials', 'wrote', 'paper', 'topic', 'first', 'year', 'American', 'History', 'class', 'college', 'then', ""'ve"", 'collected', 'modest', 'collection', 'books', 'articles', 'papers', 'subject', ""'m"", 'hardly', 'expert', 'do', 'know', 'enough', 'be', 'terribly', 'disappointed', 'newest', 'addition', 'Salem', 'collection.First', 'documentary', 'extremely', 'short', 'certainly', 'not', 'long', 'enough', 'justify', 'twenty', 'dollar', 'asking', 'price', '50', 'minutes', 'length', 'also', 'long', 'teasers', 'aired', 'prior', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'bringing', ""'actual"", 'length', 'much', 'shorter', '50', 'minutes.Second', 'even', 'accounting', 'shortness', 'content', 'here', 'extremely', 'shallow', 'realize', 'History', 'Channel', 'supposed', 'be', 'approachable', 'everyone', 'regardless', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'detailed', 'explanation', 'witches', 'were', 'persecuted', 'Bible', 'not', 'allow', 'witch', 'live', 'unnecessary', 'when', 'few', 'mere', 'sentences', 'would', 'have', 'conveyed', 'same', 'point', 'discussion', 'across', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'eat', 'up', 'time', 'magic', '50', 'minute', 'mark.Third', 'Being', 'short', 'shallow', 'bad', 'documentary', 'enthusiast', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'documentary', 'say', 'classroom', 'high', 'schoolers', 'However', 'here', 'where', 'documentary', 'most', 'troubling', '*extremely*', 'inaccurate', 'Mere', 'opinions', 'modern', 'supposition', 'are', 'presented', 'here', 'facts', 'Real', 'facts', 'would', 'undermine', 'opinions', 'are', 'kept', 'hidden', 'audience', 'interests', 'drama', '.For', 'example', 'opinion', 'aired', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'impetus', 'stopping', 'Salem', 'trials', 'was', 'nontraditional', 'people', 'such', 'men', 'were', 'accused', 'being', 'witches', 'actual', 'fact', 'first', 'three', 'executions', 'three', 'executed', 'witches', 'were', 'men', 'trials', 'still', 'continued', 'months', 'afterward', 'abating', 'even', 'losing', 'steam', 'not', 'mentioned', 'not', 'even', 'once', 'newcomer', 'topic', 'would', 'be', 'left', 'idea', 'naming', 'men', 'witches', 'was', 'what', 'caused', 'Salem', 'trials', 'end', 'when', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth.In', 'interest', 'accuracy', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'fair', 'include', 'apparent', 'biggest', 'impetus', 'ending', 'trials', 'was', 'Dutch', 'document', 'undermining', 'spectral', 'evidence', 'entirely', 'subsequent', 'dismantling', 'court', 'governor', 'nothing', 'said', 'presumably', 'sexism', 'male', 'witches', 'vs.', 'female', 'accusers', 'more', ""'sexy"", 'topic', 'politics', 'theology', 'also', 'mention', 'George', 'Burroughs', 'famous', 'recitation', 'Lord', 'Prayer', 'gallows', 'presented', 'being', 'sort', 'turning', 'point', 'peoples', 'minds', 'again', 'mentioning', 'WAS', 'turning', 'point', 'actual', 'turning', 'was', 'only', 'accomplished', 'months', 'later', 'Finally', 'narrator', 'also', 'unequivocally', 'were', 'transcripts', 'trial', 'temper', 'actual', 'fact', 'copious', 'notes', 'were', 'taken', 'several', 'judges', 'many', 'near-transcript', 'form', 'fact', 'most', 'not', 'trials', 'were', 'recorded', 'history', 'been', 'obscured', 'order', 'represent', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'fiction', 'whole', 'event', 'supposedly', 'surrounded', 'impenetrable', 'fog', 'mystery', 'dishonest', 'bad', 'documentary', 'technique', 'designed', 'entertain', 'titillate', 'rather', 'inform.An', 'admittedly', 'minor', 'gripe', 'mine', 'also', 'four', 'five', ""'experts"", 'interviewed', 'two', 'are', 'religion', 'professors', 'apparently', 'little', 'nothing', 'add', 'topic', 'unclear', 'why', 'event', 'notable', 'historical', 'psychological', 'implications', 'left', 'religionists', 'interpret', 'makers', 'decided', 'was', 'necessary', 'sprinkle', 'nice', 'religion', 'experts', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'accused', 'being', 'anti-religion', 'so', 'incredibly', 'cowardly', 'way', 'construct', 'documentary', 'focusing', 'averting', 'potential', 'criticism', 'motives', 'rather', 'giving', 'best', 'possible', 'presentation', 'regardless', 'had', 'been', '3', 'hour', 'long', 'documentary', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'minded', 'token', 'religion', 'professors', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', '50', 'minute', 'presentation', 'was', 'grating', 'watch', 'time', 'slip', 'away', ""'expert"", 'opinion', 'Puritanism', 'was', 'rough', 'religion', 'adhere', 'modern', 'jus', 'folks', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'much.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",N/A
892306,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B0007WFUQ0,Annie Van Auken,"[3, 4]","As with most such documentaries, events are told using antique writings and art intermixed with modern footage, narration and actor voices.The irony of all witchcraft trials is that from the 14th Century on, untold thousands of people were put to death by otherwise good, rational Christians because they had a skin blemish, or floated when thrown into a lake or confessed to literally anything after hours of excruciating torture. The Malleus Maleficarum, which was published in 1486 in Germany, lists a variety of seemingly benign symptoms that condemned many innocents to hanging or a fiery death.When the 1692 witch trials commenced in Salem, Massachusetts, there was almost 300 years of prosecutorial precedence for authorities to fall back on. Testimony from a group of teenaged girls, whose courtroom behavior in hindsight appears at best staged, greatly helped in convicting 19 of Salem's citizens. Acting always in unison, the howling girls' claims of being attacked in court by the accused's spectre, apparitions that were of course only visible to the children, was all it took to send their protesting neighbors to the gallows. Ultimately, 200 people from as far south as Boston were arrested based on the group's finger-pointing.The undoing of this coven of young accusers was their subsequent targeting of those who were, in the authorities' opinion, absolutely above reproach. Doubts were quickly raised as to the girls' veracity, resulting in the release from custody of dozens of untried people. In 1711, many previous convictions were overturned. Eventually, only one of the accusers apologized for taking part in the destruction of so many lives, for the scars inflicted upon these unfortunate souls' families and the loss of their properties.Epilogue: The other nine ""guilty"" people had their sentences reversed in 1957 (not much consolation after being dead and buried for over 250 years!). A large marker was also placed at that time which reads: IN MEMORY OF THOSE INNOCENTS WHO DIED DURING THE SALEM VILLAGE WITCHCRAFT HYSTERIA OF 1692.Total running time: 42 minutes",4,"""Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."" - EXODUS 22:18",1283990400,"09 9, 2010",2010,2090,"['most', 'such', 'documentaries', 'events', 'are', 'told', 'using', 'antique', 'writings', 'art', 'intermixed', 'modern', 'footage', 'narration', 'actor', 'voices.The', 'irony', 'witchcraft', 'trials', '14th', 'Century', 'untold', 'thousands', 'people', 'were', 'put', 'death', 'otherwise', 'good', 'rational', 'Christians', 'had', 'skin', 'blemish', 'floated', 'when', 'thrown', 'lake', 'confessed', 'literally', 'anything', 'hours', 'excruciating', 'torture', 'Malleus', 'Maleficarum', 'was', 'published', '1486', 'Germany', 'variety', 'seemingly', 'benign', 'symptoms', 'condemned', 'many', 'innocents', 'hanging', 'fiery', 'death.When', '1692', 'witch', 'trials', 'commenced', 'Salem', 'Massachusetts', 'was', 'almost', '300', 'years', 'prosecutorial', 'precedence', 'authorities', 'fall', 'back', 'Testimony', 'group', 'teenaged', 'girls', 'courtroom', 'behavior', 'hindsight', 'best', 'staged', 'greatly', 'helped', 'convicting', '19', 'Salem', 'citizens', 'Acting', 'always', 'unison', 'howling', 'girls', 'claims', 'being', 'attacked', 'court', 'accused', 'spectre', 'apparitions', 'were', 'course', 'only', 'visible', 'children', 'was', 'took', 'send', 'protesting', 'neighbors', 'gallows', 'Ultimately', '200', 'people', 'far', 'south', 'Boston', 'were', 'arrested', 'based', 'group', 'finger-pointing.The', 'undoing', 'coven', 'young', 'accusers', 'was', 'subsequent', 'targeting', 'who', 'were', 'authorities', 'opinion', 'absolutely', 'reproach', 'Doubts', 'were', 'quickly', 'raised', 'girls', 'veracity', 'resulting', 'release', 'custody', 'dozens', 'untried', 'people', '1711', 'many', 'previous', 'convictions', 'were', 'overturned', 'Eventually', 'only', 'one', 'accusers', 'apologized', 'taking', 'part', 'destruction', 'so', 'many', 'lives', 'scars', 'inflicted', 'unfortunate', 'souls', 'families', 'loss', 'properties.Epilogue', 'other', 'nine', 'guilty', 'people', 'had', 'sentences', 'reversed', '1957', 'not', 'much', 'consolation', 'being', 'dead', 'buried', '250', 'years', 'large', 'marker', 'was', 'also', 'placed', 'time', 'IN', 'MEMORY', 'OF', 'THOSE', 'INNOCENTS', 'WHO', 'DIED', 'DURING', 'THE', 'SALEM', 'VILLAGE', 'WITCHCRAFT', 'HYSTERIA', 'OF', '1692.Total', 'running', 'time', '42', 'minutes']",N/A

It gives a broad overview of the major events and characters in this tragic episode of fear and suspision in early colonial America.The Salem Witch saga began in the winter of 1692 with the strange behavior surrounding a number of young girls living in Salem Village, several of whom were living in the household of the controversial village minister Samuel Parris.  The girls were given to bizarre fits that the local physician was at a loss to explain except by the actions of witchcraft.  Soon accusations were leveled at the minister's Carib Indian slave woman, Tituba, who, under torture, admitted to being a witch in league with the Devil.  Before long, hundreds of people from the surrounding countryside were arrested and dragged into court to answer to charges of witchcraft.  In the end, 19 people died as a result of the tumultuous trials before public sentiment finally turned against the accusers.The Salem Witch Trials have loomed large in American history since the time they occurred.  There have been many different attempts to explain the causes of the witchcraze that swept Salem, but the debate continues to this very day.
