Sure it looks like they borrowed heavily from John Carpenter's 1982 version of ""The Thing"", but I loved that movie and I don't mind that they did. I always felt there should be more books and movies about remote settings like that. It makes a great setting for mysteries, SciFi, or horrors especially. Besides this movie is about a bunch of Satanic zombies trying to get a couple people, not a single alien terrorizing a group of scientist. After seeing this on the SciFi channel I came here to order it as it is reasonably priced even for a new copy and with Amazon prime shipping I consider it a bargain.

Inside, things are not a whole lot better, but this thriller does have some unexpected plot twists, including one with Max Perlich who portrays the resident pain in the neck.  Clayton Rohner in the lead tries hard, but can't overcome the script's many discrepancies.  Emmy-winner Faith Ford looks completely lost in her role as Jennifer, the doctor, and Chase Masterson as Rohner's sidekick gives her Sigourney Weaver imitation.
