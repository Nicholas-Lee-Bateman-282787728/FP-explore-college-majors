I found the premise of the film to be interesting but some of the jokes fall flat. This film is saved by the adorable Emma Stone. Stone is likeable, charming, and a has strong comedic timing for someone so young. She keeps this movie above float, and of course so does the still hilarious Lisa Kudrow. I usually like Amanda Bynes in other movies but I found her performance as a judgemental Christian girl to be rather wooden and annoying.

The movie is filled with so much random comedy, but it does have purpose and that is what I love about it.

Rumors are spread around the schools like wildfire faster than ever thanks to social networks and texting. Privacy is sacrificed more and more as each day passes and this film definitely gives a ""it's none of business!"" vibe to the main character and it is well deserved for her.Whether you liked it or not, although I really do not see how anyone could not like this movie, it will become one of the best movies of this new decade.

1328298,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0036TGSIK,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Outside of a spectacular star turn from Emma Stone, I can't say that `Easy A' is all that exciting really.  It kind of reminds me of a cheap rip off of 2004's `Saved', yet nowhere near as witty or memorable.  The film revolves around a young girl named Olive who is almost too quick to lend a helping hand to a friend.  When her `not yet out' friend Brandon asks her to fake-sleep with him in order to establish a `straight' presence in the school, she agrees.  After that she gets asked countless times to `lend her services' to others who want an ego boost.  Sadly, this completely ruins her reputation despite the fact that she hasn't actually done anything she's claimed to.  Things get out of control, she loses her best friend and winds up being taken advantage of by someone she really liked.  Obviously things work out for her, but getting there just doesn't feel fresh at all.  Thankfully, Emma Stone is so chuck full of charisma and attitude that she sells EVERY scene she's in.  In fact, she gives probably the best comedic performance of last year, despite starring in a subpar comedy.  Amanda Bynes (oh god how I once loved you) is a regrettable stereotype and Lisa Kudrow isn't given nearly enough screen time.  I loved the Tucci/Clarkson parental combo, but I just wish they had more to do.  In the end I was baffled by the countless structural ripoffs here (I mean really, watch `Saved' and tell me that this film didn't try to copy it nearly verbatim) and can't really understand the love, unless that love comes from a blinding adoration for the film's star.

Her story starts here at Easy A, a smart, surprisingly good film from director Will Gluck.  Gluck's made a film that will appeal to a number of different demographics without insulting or boring the others.  Ms. Stone is winning and compelling here (feisty and clearly whip-smart), but it was the whole ensemble - especially the adults - that endeared me to this film.  Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson win - hands-down - best parents of teen protagonist.  They're a hoot together turning what could be banal scenes into small, comedic masterpieces.  Tucci - polling the family for a selection for that night's DVD watching - says he wants to ""cross watching 'The Bucket List' off of my bucket list.""  Clarkson - ostensibly meant to be counseling Stone's Olive on the birds and bees - is suddenly regaling her daughter with tales of her limber, youthful body and its relation to her popularity.Thomas Haden Church - so good in everything he does with that deadpan delivery - is superb here again as Olive's teacher/quasi-counselor.  God knows Olive's not getting the counseling she needs from the school's real holder of that title, Lisa Kudrow (who's also Haden Church's character's wife).  It's also interesting to see Amanda Bynes, typically in Stone's role as the adorable lead (see, most notably the very goodWhat a Girl Wants (Keepcase)with Colin Firth), cast smartly against type here as the Mean Girl.",4,"Emma Stone will be a huge star, but for me it's Tucci, Clarkson and Haden Church that are this movie's great treats",1327708800,"01 28, 2012",2012,1536,"['Hollywood', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'make', 'star', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'Emma', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'who', 'will', 'win', 'day', 'story', 'here', 'Easy', 'A', 'smart', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'film', 'director', 'Will', 'Gluck', 'Gluck', 'made', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'number', 'different', 'demographics', 'insulting', 'boring', 'others', 'Ms.', 'Stone', 'winning', 'compelling', 'here', 'feisty', 'clearly', 'whip-smart', 'was', 'whole', 'ensemble', 'especially', 'adults', 'endeared', 'film', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'win', 'hands-down', 'best', 'parents', 'teen', 'protagonist', ""'re"", 'hoot', 'together', 'turning', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'banal', 'scenes', 'small', 'comedic', 'masterpieces', 'Tucci', 'polling', 'family', 'selection', 'night', 'DVD', 'watching', 'cross', 'watching', 'Bucket', 'List', 'off', 'bucket', 'list', 'Clarkson', 'ostensibly', 'meant', 'be', 'counseling', 'Stone', 'Olive', 'birds', 'bees', 'suddenly', 'regaling', 'daughter', 'tales', 'limber', 'youthful', 'body', 'relation', 'popularity.Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'so', 'good', 'everything', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'superb', 'here', 'again', 'Olive', 'teacher/quasi-counselor', 'God', 'Olive', 'not', 'getting', 'counseling', 'school', 'real', 'holder', 'title', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'who', 'also', 'Haden', 'Church', 'character', 'wife', 'also', 'interesting', 'see', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'typically', 'Stone', 'role', 'adorable', 'lead', 'see', 'most', 'notably', 'very', 'Girl', 'Wants', 'Keepcase', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'cast', 'smartly', 'type', 'here', 'Mean', 'Girl']",N/A

1328305,AAX387K7441BL,B0036TGSIK,AvidReader,"[14, 19]","As a teacher of teens (currently on a sabbatical) I am always on the look out for films that will appeal to this age group and provide good material for discussion, and possibly a valuable message about life.Did Easy A deliver? I guess some students would really take to this film and there is plenty of scope for discussion, but ultimately it was a big let-down for me.Don't get me wrong, there are some really funny moments in the movie, and for these moments alone the film is worth watching, but I happen to like my dialogue peppered with a strong dose of realism, and this was sadly lacking. This movie is just so smug and self-aware that it is quite nauseating at times (like Juno, another movie I couldn't stomach). Now I could deal with the bad dialogue and constant stream of one-liners that turn the characters in caricatures, but the thing irked me the most was that Easy A makes such a big deal about how liberal and ""contemporary"" it is. In reality the message of this movie is highly conservative and reinforces all the tired clich&eacute;s about finding prince charming and living happily ever after. Oh yeah, and good girls always get their man in the end. Pass me the bucket.Why did the main character have to be a virgin? As this film is all about sexual politics wouldn't it have been a whole lot more interesting if she was an actual ""slut"" (ie. anyone who is not a virgin in the context of this film) who, based on her experiences, decided to make a stand about the rigid double-standard that is still alive and kicking in high schools around the world? When she started dressing like a scarlet woman and sewed the A on her clothes, I found it very unconvincing and condescending not to mention confusing. What exactly was she trying to say? Fair enough she had a case when everyone started gossiping about her after they thought she'd slept with one guy, but when she agreed to let people believe that she'd slept with pretty much anyone who asked (and for money) the film loses all right to a serious message.Did she think that young women she be free to go around exchanging sexual favors for money at school without condemnation? How was she standing up against the sexual objectification of women by dressing like a prostitute for most of the movie? Why were there no actual ""sluts"" in the film that she could have developed some solidarity with? What the hell was the musical number about at the end when she jumps out of a woodpile like a stripper at a bucks night and proceeds to prance around the auditorium in lingerie? (while the principal does nothing to stop her!). I think this was meant to be empowering but I'm not sure how, especially as the whole thing was orchestrated with the help of her new boyfriend.The movie was clearly trying to draw parallels between the way women were treated in the times of the Scarlet Letter and today, but at least the Scarlet Letter was about a real ""slut"" ie. someone who had broken the unspoken rules of a patriarchal society and paid the price. By making the main character a virgin (and her best friend too), this film is tacitly reinforcing the idea that girls who have sex are sluts. It's no coincidence that the only female character in the film who does have sex is the school counselor (and Olive's English teacher's wife), who is committing adultery by having a highly unethical relationship with a student. It's also no coincidence that Olive is persuaded into lying about having sex out of a desire to help the socially challenged boys who seek her out - in others words she is a very good girl indeed.How is this in any way helpful to the millions of teenage girls around the world who do choose to have sex and then have to grapple with the double-standard when they are labeled as sluts? Young girls are bombarded with so many images and messages today that tell them that to attract boys that need to look and act like porn stars, but when do this they are often judged and ostracized. So-called ""raunch culture"" is something that I feel strongly about because I think it's just so damaging to young women, especially the ones with low self-esteem who are more likely to try to gain acceptance through sex, and in my opinion this film did nothing to challenge any of this. In the end it reinforced the negative and confusing stereotypes that it was claiming to challenge by sending the message to women that they need to be highly sexualised but also pure and virginal at the same time - the virgin / whore thing all over again.A truly courageous film would have made the main character a much more complex and interesting person. Someone that has had sex (for real) and earned herself a reputation, and then decided to do something about it (the best movie I've ever seen along these lines is Chasing Amy) That would have been a message worth listening to, and the gorgeous Emma Stone could easily have pulled it off. She also would have been a much more relatable character for the ""scarlet women"" of today who can't go on facebook and announce that, hey it was all just a big joke and they didn't actually have sex with those boys. In a perfect world young women would wait for the right guy to come along and sweep them off their feet, but we don't live in a perfect world, and this film's ultimate message is that abstinence will be rewarded. Not a bad message in itself and I agree that girls shouldn't rush into sex, but let's not pretend that this is groundbreaking stuff that does anything to challenge the double standard.I know the film thought it was being ironic through references to 80s movies, but at the end of the day it really is just another ideological fantasy dressed up as a hip, wise-cracking, self-referential comedy. As far as teen movies go I much preferred 10 Things I Hate About You. At least the two main characters had a little bit of grit - Kat had slept with the wrong guy (for real, not pretend), while Heath Ledger's character was a juvenile delinquent. The musical number he performed actually fitted into the film and was so much more romantic and enjoyable than the terrible song and semi-stripper performance at the end of Easy A!Sorry, but this film

1328308,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0036TGSIK,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","Easy A actually turned out to be a very funny comedy starring the beautiful Emma Stone. I was expecting nothing more than a typically written teenage storyline involving relationship troubles. No, it's honestly quite different from the norm.It's about Emma Stone's character struggling to find where she stands in the world and wants to find a decent guy to have a relationship with.  Well one thing leads to another and she eventually goes down a darker path.  After a few experiences, a plan develops (unexpectedly) where she pretends to sleep with the guys around her school for money.She's not really sleeping with them though, but for the sake of the guys reputation (who would like nothing more than to be considered cool so their friends believe they just scored with a chick) she goes through with pretending to sleep with them. It's not a dirty plot or anything though. The amount of swear words is kept to a minimum, and there's no actual nudity. The focus is most definitely on humor and clever storyline twists.Anyway, while this is going on, Emma's character has to deal with other people at school. Some of them she likes, others she flat out despises. A sassy religious girl is one of the classmates she despises, however a reliable male friend of hers is someone Emma always turns to for help. Emma's parents are about as whacked out as one can imagine, haha.There's a lot of clever writing as far as the storyline goes, especially once the guidance counselor makes an appearance. Her involvement is really surprising and really pushes this film to a solid 5 stars.Overall, Emma Stone is as impressive and believable in character form as one can expect, and the storyline is always enticing.",5,an easy A indeed,1308873600,"06 24, 2011",2011,1707,"['Easy', 'A', 'actually', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'comedy', 'starring', 'beautiful', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'was', 'expecting', 'nothing', 'more', 'typically', 'written', 'teenage', 'storyline', 'involving', 'relationship', 'troubles', 'No', 'honestly', 'quite', 'different', 'norm.It', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'character', 'struggling', 'find', 'where', 'world', 'find', 'decent', 'guy', 'have', 'relationship', 'Well', 'one', 'thing', 'eventually', 'down', 'darker', 'path', 'few', 'experiences', 'plan', 'unexpectedly', 'where', 'sleep', 'guys', 'school', 'money.She', 'not', 'really', 'sleeping', 'sake', 'guys', 'reputation', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'nothing', 'more', 'be', 'considered', 'cool', 'so', 'friends', 'believe', 'just', 'scored', 'chick', 'pretending', 'sleep', 'not', 'dirty', 'plot', 'anything', 'amount', 'swear', 'words', 'kept', 'minimum', 'actual', 'nudity', 'focus', 'most', 'definitely', 'humor', 'clever', 'storyline', 'twists.Anyway', 'going', 'Emma', 'character', 'deal', 'other', 'people', 'school', 'others', 'flat', 'out', 'despises', 'sassy', 'religious', 'girl', 'one', 'classmates', 'however', 'reliable', 'male', 'friend', 'hers', 'someone', 'Emma', 'always', 'help', 'Emma', 'parents', 'are', 'whacked', 'one', 'can', 'imagine', 'lot', 'clever', 'writing', 'as', 'far', 'storyline', 'especially', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'appearance', 'involvement', 'really', 'surprising', 'really', 'pushes', 'film', 'solid', '5', 'stars.Overall', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'impressive', 'believable', 'character', 'form', 'one', 'can', 'expect', 'storyline', 'always', 'enticing']",N/A

1328318,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B0036TGSIK,Chris Kennison,"[0, 0]","EASY A is quite simply a modern day adaption of the classic tale THE SCARLET LETTER. A story of a woman who is accused of adultery by her community and forced to wear a scarlet A from that point on. In EASY A, Olive (the fantasticly dry and sharp witted Emma Stone), is the victim of a bathroom conversation in which she tells her friend that nothing happened between her and a college stud, but her friend doesn't believe her and neither does the ease-dropping ears. So when the rumor starts to spread like a viral u-tube video, Olive, the virgin, becomes Olive the promiscuous girl that nobody knew before and now EVERYBODY wants to know.EASY A is about lies and the danger of assumption. It's about how easy it is for reality to become something entirely different and how hard it is to change people's views of what they know the truth to be.The beauty of EASY A is that for a movie about lies, assumptions and skewed truths, the movie is so true to itself, real and honest. Olive's parents Rosemary & Dill (Patricia Clarkson & Stanley Tucci) are absolutely brilliant in their laid back, hippie mentality of being honest and open with their children. Until Olive gets caught up in her domino effect of lies and her new personna with her friends at school, her parents knew everything about her. There were no secrets because they had an open dialogue with her.So when Olive chooses popularity over trying to correct the false rumor about her, she for the first time holds a secret from her friends and parents and we see how lies, secrets and assumptions can destroy even the best of us.EASY A is hilarious in its honesty and among its laughs, in a subtle, quiet way, delivers a poigniant message.

1328319,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0036TGSIK,Chris Pandolfi,"[132, 147]","It's easy to like a character, but it isn't often you come across one that you would want to actually be friends with, or maybe even wish you could be like. For me, such a character is Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone), a high-school student from Ojai, California. True, she may only be a fictional character, but she's also the embodiment of personality - smart, witty, and affable, yet not so perfect or above it all that she fails to be human. Despite these magnetic qualities, she isn't noticed much by her peers, and she's all but upstaged by her best friend (Aly Michalka), who makes it a point to believe only what she wants to believe instead of actually listening to the truth. Things drastically change for Olive when she gains an infamous reputation as the school floozy, something she didn't start but certainly chose to perpetuate.Her story is told in ""Easy A,"" which is not only one of the funniest teen comedies of recent memory, but is also one of the most intelligent. Rather than go for obvious lowbrow sex and booze toilet humor, director Will Gluck and writer Bert V. Royal show the temerity to engage the audience with clever dialogue, strong characters, and a plot we can actually care about. It doesn't play down to the audience. If we laugh, it's not because of a vulgar throwaway gag but because of genuinely funny scenarios, many of which are relatable to varying degrees. Perhaps the film is founded on an extraordinary premise, but in my mind, it's a perfectly plausible premise, and the fact that the filmmakers could keep the story grounded while making it entertaining is quite an amazing achievement.Olive's infamy begins when she lies about having lost her virginity over the weekend to a college student she made up. The lie is overheard by Marianne (Amanda Bynes), a judgmental and pious Little Miss Christian, who proceeds to tell everyone she knows about Olive's indiscretion. Rumors quickly spread. Other students begin to take notice of her, and although she never asked for her newfound reputation, she finds she's appreciating the attention. She's then approached by her gay friend, Brandon (Dan Byrd), who's so tired of being harassed by homophobic bullies that he begs her to pretend to have sex with him. Knowing that no one would believe her if she simply told people about it, Olive drags Brandon to a classmate's party, where they lock themselves in a bedroom and make all the necessary noises. Everyone is fooled.This includes Marianne and her circle of Christian friends, one of whom boldly suggests that Olive follow the lead of Hester Prynne in ""The Scarlett Letter"" and mark herself. Not content with doing things half-heartedly, Olive arrives at school the next day wearing a bustier with a red A affixed to the right breast. In due time, she's approached by other boys who want Olive to do for them what she did for Brandon; she agrees to help them all, although she's well aware that the situation is getting out of hand. It's bad enough that they're using her to inflate their egos. Why must they also compensate her with gift certificates and coupons to affordable stores like The Home Depot and Bed Bath and Beyond?The ads have prepared us to view Olive as a clich&eacute; - a wisecracking teen who never shows her emotions and flaunts her superior intellect in the form of biting sarcasm and dry wit. But we end up seeing nothing of the sort. Olive is a young woman of considerable depth, jokey on the outside but within harboring needs, hopes, and deep insecurities. They emerge during scenes with the school mascot, Woodchuck Todd (Penn Badgley), the one guy who has known Olive most of her life and sees the person behind the reputation. Through him, she comes to believe that regaining her self-respect depends on tracking down each of the boys she helped and coercing them into telling the truth. This proves far more difficult than she expected. It's just as well; the root of ""self-respect"" is ""self,"" which is to say no one other than her can turn the situation around.Other characters, such as Olive's loveably liberal parents (Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci) and her perpetually flustered school principal (Malcolm McDowell), add color to the story, even if they are a bit less three-dimensional and serve mostly as comedy relief. The English teacher, Mr. Griffith (Thomas Hayden Church), is not only as witty and charming as Olive but is also remarkably perceptive; the same cannot be said about Mr. Griffith's estranged wife (Lisa Kudrow), which is ironic since she's the school's guidance counselor. I don't want to reveal too much about this couple. Let it suffice to say that Olive's actions have consequences that extend beyond the limits of the student body.The film is told as a retrospective, Olive opening the film with a webcam confessional that continuously weaves in and out of the story proper. This is far from an original narrative technique, but Stone's performance and Royal's dialogue elevates it to new heights. Right at the start, we're drawn to this character, and we want to stay near her even after the story has come to an end. Not too many roles have this kind of power. Not too many teen comedies are this well written. ""Easy A"" is a sweet, sassy, ingenious little movie, one that I hope will not be forgotten ten years from now.",4,"She's Not a Trollop, She Just Plays One in School",1285804800,"09 30,

She more than held her own with Anna Faris which is no small accomplishment.  She was good in ""Zombieland"" but that was more of an ensemble film that didn't allow her to stand out.  ""Easy A"" is not only a starring vehicle for Stone but allows her to spread her wings and shine.  The film is basically a retelling of ""The Scarlet Letter"" by way of John Hughes.  Stone plays Olive, an independent thinking high-school student whose iconoclasm stymies her efforts to fit in.  Olive embellishes to a friend a tale of her losing her virginity and the ensuing firestorm takes her by surprise.  At first Olive is bemused but then decides to use her newfound notoriety to her financial advantage.  As her reputation as a tramp escalates Olive feeds the flames but the results begin to backfire on her.  ""Easy A"" makes some interesting points about the teen class system, sex, and morality.

The humour count per minute is incredibly high for a movie which actually has a plot.  The only minute which does not have a joke is the last one, when the movie is being wrapped up before the novel presentation of the end credits.Notable features are:1.  There are no time-wasting romantic interludes.2.  No cheesy bits anywhere in the movie.3.  No cliches.4.  No apology made for politically incorrect humour.5.  No physical comedy.  The witty script does not depend on physical comedy to get laughs.  Body language from good acting enhances the comedic ambience.  The part where Emma Stone punches her pretend-sex partner in the belly - I really did not see that one coming.6.  Excellent subtitles, which occasionally moves unobstrusively to other parts of the screen.  I need the subtitles because there are a number of difficult SAT words which could easily have been misspelt.7.  An excellent soundtrack.  Many songs are by the original singers, like Natasha Bedingfield.8.  No crude or foul language.  No sexual inuendos.  No nudity.  No references to current events.  However, I had to google Urban Dictionary to find the meaning of ""butter bean"" and ""lemon squeeze"".9.  A real, believable setting in an actual Californian town Ojai (""oh-high"") in Ventura.  No super-rich, no mansions, no ostentatious displays of wealth, no playing up of class distinction: which underscores the theme of being ostracized by peers.

1328338,A28S3F43F76HSH,B0036TGSIK,"D. Sorel ""book lovah""","[1, 2]","The story follows a high school student named Olive who isn't the most popular girl in school but isn't really looking to be the talk of the school. When the weekend comes, her best friend invites her to go camping but Olive just wants to spend the weekend at home. Olive decides to lie to her friend and tells her that she has a date that weekend. At school on Monday, Olive's best friend pesters Olive about her imaginary date until Olive says that they had sex. Word gets around school and suddenly Olive is the talk of the high school. One of Olive's friends hears about the rumor which Olive confesses is not true. However, her friend does not care for he is being bullied about being gay and wants to prove to the school that he's not. So he and Olive attend a popular party where they secure and room and pretend to have sex so that entire party can hear. The next day at school the rumors about the boy's sexuality are cast aside while Olive becomes the main attraction. Olive continues to have fake sex with numerous boys in school so that it will help their reputation. Yet, the backlash causes Olive to become ostracized as she finds that though she believes she is helping these boys, she is not being true to herself.First let me get out of the way my complaints with the film, which are few:1. the plot is a bit contrived2. the acting is not exceptional3. the connection between the students reading The Scarlett Letter and Olive's being ostracized (to the point of wearing a scarlet A) is about a subtle as an anvil falling on one's headBut many tween movies are criticized for the same problems in script and acting, so I don't want to elaborate more on it here. Still, the good in this film completely outweighs the bad. These are a few of the things that I think separate this film from other asinine dopey chick flix:1. this is NOT (thank god) a coming of age tale2. there is little romance and some good comedy3. it is not self righteous in its messageI think that the message of this film is very good and not something that you see everyday. Most teen films are about falling in love with the person you thought you hated (when does that ever really happen?) or being led astray by the glitter and false happiness of popularity. However, this movie is about how doing something that seems altruistic can actually come back to hurt you and others. It's about helping others while never losing your sense of self.

1328341,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B0036TGSIK,Elisabeth,"[5, 8]","**REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**Reading over the one-star reviews, I noticed two main criticisms of this movie.  The first criticism is the acting is terrible.I actually thought Emma Stone gave a good performance and had good comedic timing.  There were a couple of occasions where I laughed out loud.However, the acting by everyone else wasn't as good -- specifically the overdone performances by Amanda Bynes and Lisa Kudrow.The other criticism is the parents don't come across as very believable.  But I've actually met parents who seem to care more about being a hip and cool buddy than a parent who gives firm guidelines.  These types of parents seem afraid that any kind of boundary-setting or rules will peg them as control freaks, so they go the opposite extreme and become laissez faire parents instead.This is especially true with the dad.  When his daughter gets detention, he doesn't show any disappointment at all.  Instead, he tells her that the other girl probably deserved the disparaging name his daughter called her.  He doesn't bother to ask why she resorted to name-calling or advise her how to handle the situation in a more mature way.  Instead, he takes a I-don't-want-to-judge-you-so-I'll-judge-others-instead stance.And later, when seeing his daughter sewing her new revealing wardrobe, he tells her to ""give them hell"".  Again, he doesn't bother to ask why she'd want to raise hell or even what kind of hell she plans on inflicting.  He just approves of her destructive coping mechanisms and walks away.His hands-off approach is supposed to demonstrate how much he values her autonomy, but she was still a teen needing guidance.  Perhaps some of her mishaps could've been prevented had he been less concerned about being a cool buddy and more concerned about being a parent.But again, I've seen this behavior in other parents, so these parents didn't come across as unbelievable to me as they did to the one and two star reviewers.So, what criticisms did I have?  I had two.The first was the hypocritical message about judging others.  Throughout the film, the main character self-righteously claims she doesn't want to judge others...all the while judging the Catholics in this film.  The Catholics in this film are all portrayed as one dimensional, intolerant, know-it-alls.Now granted, there are people like this that exist - even Athiests - but there are also people like this that don't exist - yes, even among Catholics - but they aren't shown here to balance out the picture.So, on the one hand, there's the message that you should be more tolerant of those who are different from you...but on the other hand, that acceptance and understanding doesn't extend to Catholics.The second criticism I had was the message about what to do if you discover someone you know is being cheated on.  In this case, the main character knows a beloved teacher is being cheated on by his wife, but instead of choosing to protect him, she chooses to protect his wife...and even further ruins her reputation just to protect her.She later gets revenge on the wife by blurting out the truth to the teacher.  When her confession leads to him divorcing his wife, she says that her regret wasn't lying for his wife, but rather telling the truth to the teacher and ""breaking up their marriage"".But there's 4 problems with this revelation:First, it wasn't the student who broke up the marriage.  It was the wife's lying that did.  Or at least, her lying is what motivated the teacher to decide, for himself, that he wanted to end his marriage.Second, if she should regret anything, it should be her motives for telling the truth.  She revealed the truth as an act of revenge, rather than an act of protecting a friend.  But the fact that she revealed it at all wasn't something to regret.Third, withholding the truth goes against the messages spread in this movie -- which is, respecting other people's ability to make their own decisions.If she had kept the truth from him, then he wouldn't have the knowledge to make an informed decision to stay married or divorce.I understand neither the wife nor the student wanted him to choose divorce, but that wasn't their choice alone to make.  It was his, too...and his freedom to choose shouldn't be stripped away from him.I also understand the student wanted to protect his feelings, but lying doesn't protect him, it protects his wife.  And his wife was awful.Not only did the wife condone the main character further ruining her rep for her, but she had the audacity to blame her husband for her infidelity.  She claimed he didn't pay enough attention to her sexually and then when this handsome student did, she went for it.But earlier, when the husband tried to get sexual with her, it was the wife who pushed him away. Also, if things were as bad as she claimed, then why didn't she get a divorce first?And finally, during the affair, the wife contracted chlamydia.  The husband had the right to know his health would be jeopardized by having sex with his wife.Earlier I said the main character had some funny zingers that made me laugh out loud, however, after awhile she also came across as whiney, too.I mean, she sets out to get negative attention by wearing revealing clothes and then when she gets it, she plays the victim card, acting like she's being bullied.  So apparently, it's ok for her to poke others, but when others poke back, they're just being mean.Overall, this movie had it's funny moments, but those moments were overshadowed by messages that were either hypocritical or stripped others of their right to make their own decisions.",2,I had different criticisms of this movie,1310515200,"07 13, 2011",2011,5604,"['**REVIEW', 'CONTAINS',

1328346,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B0036TGSIK,Enjolras,"[10, 15]","Unlike all the other teen comedies my wife likes, I was actually looking forward toEasy A. I'd heard good things about Emma Stone, and Amanda Byrnes has been in some funny modernized adaptations of classic tories.Easy Awas billeted as an update ofThe Scarlet Letter. Unfortunately, it fails to live up to its promise.First, I'm not sure how this movie receives praise for its acting. I'm usually pretty tolerant of bad acting, as long as I can suspend my disbelief for an hour or two. However, I was never sold by the acting inEasy A. Too often it feels like the actors are reading from a script. Even Byrnes seems unsure how to play a Christian fundamentalist - it just isn't the right role for her.More importantly, the script just doesn't really work. It becomes too predictable too early and Olive's decisions seem too ridiculous to sympathize with. There are some plot devices that seem simply thrown in for one or two lame jokes, such as the African-American adopted brother - it's clear he has no other role except to make a joke about awkward it is for white parents to adopt an African kid. Occasionally, the film delivers some really witty lines, but these are few and often delivered awkwardly.

I doubt anyone can be that clever all the time but it sounds cool. Easy A is very similar in that respect. I wasn't certain how I would like it due to the fact that it IS a younger person's movie and I'm anything but. But I found myself enjoying the heck out of it. It's funny, thoughtful and clever as all get out. Maybe too clever.Emma Stone plays Olive, a high school outsider, who, in order to not seem so outsider-ish, lies about having had sex. As word gets out she finds she needs to help all manner of guys ease their personal shortcomings and insecurities by lying about having sex with them. They pay her for her kindness but as the lies get deeper and spread further it ends up effecting many of the people around her in unexpected ways.As goofy as the premise is here it's still a lot of fun. Emma Stone does a great job as the overly bright and clever Olive. Her overbite fueled speech impediment lends a certain endearing quality to her character. Stan Tucci is his usual great self as her dad and Patricia Clarkson does a good job as her mom. All the other primary characters are played well by their perspective drivers. The production values are good enough, the music is good enough and, at a crisp 92 minutes, it gets in and out before it wares out its welcome.On the downside is its cleverness. It's a bit ""too."" As much as I like Olive's folks they are just too clever and too understanding and too hip. Even though it was fun to watch, I simply didn't buy it. Also on  the downside was the Lisa Kudrow character. The part wasn't that well written and I still can't shake the Phoebe-ness from her every time I see her. The Malcolm McDowell character is little more than a sketch, and the Thomas Haden Church character is pretty good but also a bit too clever and hip.That being said, this is still a fun ride. You like the characters you're supposed to like and you love to hate the characters you're supposed to hate. Though it's easy to pigeon-hole this as a teen comedy there's more going on here than that.

Emma can't resist helping him, and they accomplish Brandon's goal by faking noisy, obvious sex together behind a closed bedroom door at a wild teen party. The plan is so successful, Brandon can't resist telling other male social outcasts at their high school about it. They in turn beg Olive to help them in the same manner. Each time, Olive is too kind to refuse any of them. Soon she is placed in the awkward position of being cast in two contradictory, attention-getting roles in life: the secret rescuer of downtrodden boys whom she pretends to sleep with, and the girl with the unsavory reputation as the school tramp.Many mainstream movie reviewers have drawn comparisons between the quality of this film and the delightful re-imagining of Jane Austen'sEmmain the form of the movieCluelessin terms of the quirky plot and the talent and charisma of the female stars. I agree completely that Emma Stone is wonderful, and there are plenty of other great actors doing wonderful jobs with their characters. I particularly enjoyed the extremely talented Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson as Olive's confused but affectionately supportive, ""politically correct"" parents. These two are a source of a lot of witty dialogue.I've enjoyed cute Amanda Bynes as the lead actress in other clever teen comedies, and here she does an excellent job as a holier-than-thou antagonist to poor Olive, shaming her for her seeming lack of morals. Penn Badgley, a wholesomely sexy young star from theGossip GirlTV series, plays Olive's love interest and does an admirable job as a comic ""straight man"" in a see of wildly oddball characters.Even though this movie has the obligatory, semi-orgy of a teen drinking party, the humor in that scene, for once, doesn't come from drunkenness, toilet and vomit jokes. Instead it comes from the quirky setup I described above with Olive's best friend. The movie also frequently provokes laughter due to witty dialogue, relatable, sympathetic characters, and a protagonist who gets into trouble not because of teen naivete or venality, but because Olive cares very much about the underdog and is determined to help them out, even if it costs her personally. In my humble opinion, that is the best kind of protagonist there is.

Still to be honest I was not really looking to see this that bad, until my girl got it and had me watch it with her. Of course it was along the lines of these new John Hughes style flicks but it was good. I don't think it turned out as classic as Hughes's films but it was a nice homage to the man's movies.Olive [Emma Stone] is your typical teenager in high school just looking to fit in even though she is an obvious individual with a personality. Still she tries to fit in any way especially with her best friend who she ends up lying to about not only a date but loosing her virginity. Like most news that is passed around in high school it all starts in the bathroom, and the wrong person hears it. Almost immediately the rumors start and she now has a reputation, although not the best one she is now noticed.Of course now she is getting all kinds of offers and she even kinda takes them, kinda. She takes payment for her services but she only agrees to say she does stuff with people to help their rep. Of course her legend only grows as does her problems and her feelings about everything. She must deal with what people think of her, some religious students, and of course her best friend who is turning on her. Oh and did I mention the guy she actually likes, makes for an interesting time.Written by Bert V. Royal and directed by Will Gluck this film manages to rise above being just another average film. The direction is nice and the script is excellent as it plays on not only John Hughes films but also on the book ""Scarlet Latter"". Of course if you know that story that explains the A part of the title of the film more s than her just being at school, I am sure you know what I mean.Emma stone is excellent here as she has been in everything I have seen her in thus far; this may be her best performance yet. Every one including Thomas Haden Church and Lisa Kudrow but it was real nice to see Amanda Bynes in this. I will admit right now I am a fan of hers mainly because I loved a show back in the day called ""All That"". She did a great job as the arch enemy of Emma here with the whole overly religious thing. Of course the film makers had her play that stereo typical over the top religious person but it was good.This film ended up being pretty good but as it went it started to slip a little bit, but not enough to hurt it. Over all I would say it is worth a rental at least especially if you are into this type of film. A fun cast mixed with a great script made for a good film, well worth the time.

1328351,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B0036TGSIK,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[5, 10]","I heard mostly good things about Easy A, but after viewing, I am a bit astonished by the many favorable reviews, especially considering how relatively commonplace this comedy is. Easy A tells the story of one high school girl who uses a rumor of having sex to boost her popularity. She finds that things quickly get out of hand, and she tries to protect her image, keep her friendship, and more importantly try to find out who she is amidst all the high school mayhem and gossip.  The film attempts to be satirical in some ways and genuine in others, but there are missed opportunities to make it a funny, unique movie. Instead, there is a run of the mill approach to direction, characterization and plot, and it suffers from being rather false .Easy A is surprisingly mediocre, its presentation phony and superficial, using caricatures rather than characters to sell its plot, with its story and lesson being somewhat petty.  Indicative of Hollywood high school land, we have prototype antagonists, cardboard to the max, whose sole purpose is to fling degrading insults at the protagonist. The film further shows its immature approach by using Christians as the major antagonists as a parallel to Hawthorne's hypocritical Puritans (in The Scarlet Letter). (Apparently Christians are fair game as being portrayed as disingenuous in Hollywood...Where are the Hollywood PC police when you really need them?) Olive's parents are ridiculously unbelievable, quite annoying, having apparently been transplanted directly from the set of Juno to Easy A, as their super duper hip, cool demeanor towards anything and everything Olive has to throw at them doesn't faze them a bit. (That scene with Olive and her mom talking and her mom describing her sexual exploits...ummm..yeah, right, like THAT would ever happen). Meanwhile, Olive's friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka) is the biggest nitwit of them all, and I'm still trying to figure out how they were ""friends"" in the first place. Not only was their friendship shallow and insincere, but it was pretty much unnecessary to the movie's plot other than bringing in some contrived conflict. And, as a whole, the movie pretty much reeked of phoniness trying to embody some serious life lesson, but really comes across hallow to the core. Easy A sells itself as some modern rehashing of Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, but it is a very flimsy, superficial one at that. It's too bad, because Easy A could have been a clever satire.The one saving grace of Easy A is Emma Stone. While I liked Emma Stone's performance, I didn't think the script (or its lack of originality) did her any justice, or gave her much to work with. Her character Olive, however, does have some depth (unlike virtually every other character), but everything about the whole fake sex thing seemed so dumb and contrived. (Are all the students, counselors, teachers and principle at this school that gullible, dense, and dim-witted? I guess so.)  Still, I liked her better in The Rocker and Zombieland, where her sarcastic, witty demeanor and acting ability shines, and she does not have to carry a film.Easy A is pretty the stuff of your standard Hollywood tripe.

But on a recommendation, I went to see this movie, and my time was not wasted.  The reason it works so well is that the star Emma Stone (as Olive Penderghast) naturally communicates intelligence, charm, and old fashioned girl charisma. By the end of the film, we're not sure whether we want her as a virgin..or not.Now that we are in the 21st century, the meaning of Hawthorne's ""Scarlet Letter"" - the ""A"" - which stands for adultery is far less scandalous.  So when Olive daringly sews such a letter on her dress (over her breast, no less) she communicates a vibrant sexuality. But is that good or bad?Our heroine is going to high school in a conservative part of Southern California. When Olive tells a white lie that she had a teenage affair, voila...she becomes the ""gossip of the day"";  Suddenly this reclusive girl becomes the one female that everyone notices.  Being of good heart - as opposed to her fundamentalist Christian nemesis - she uses this new power to help others' reputations, such as a gay student who is constantly bullied for being so.  (The scene where she misleads her classmates to believe she is having 'wild sex"" with the gay fellow is hilarious).The themes of the movie - how society perceives sexuality -  how an individual develops a sense of self worth = are important ones.  And those themes are handled fluidly by the good ensemble cast. For example, Stanley Tucci as her liberal minded parent is a hoot. (When her mom says that she is starting to look like a hooker, her dad remarks, yes...but a high class hooker.  I guess most of us don't have parents ""that"" open minded.)

This was another one of those high school teenage drama comedies--it kind of reminded me of Mean Girls, actually. The acting was great, as was the casting. Many of the major actors come from some of my favorite TV shows. The story was not easy to predict either, which put me at the edge of my seat, trying to figure out what would happen next.I see that some people gave this movie just 1 or 2 stars because they felt it was not representative of today's high school kids. While I'm sure there are many other positive reviews here to counter-argue that, you have to realize that every school is different. And there are plenty of schools where rumors spread quickly, and reputations are ruined, with whispers in the hall and clicks on smartphones. Sure, some of the situations seem extreme, and you're not likely to find a girl like Olive who is going out of her way to be known as the school slut. But it's a movie, and anyone old enough to watch this should know better that some of these movie scenes almost never happen in real life. It's a movie, after all; the producers have got to make it feistier and show something we don't see every day.This movie was my first exposure to Emma Stone, and it did not disappoint.

That was exactly my idea when I first heard of this film. My thoughts were : Ok, it's gonna be cheesy, boring and completely unbelievable. I was having a headache, I didn't have anything to do and I wanted to watch this movie just to kill time. However, I have to say this film has got me by surprise ! I guess I underestimated this movie a lot which only proves that you really shouldn't judge the book by its cover.Olive (Emma Stone) is a highschool student in California. She's unpopular, anonymous and completely lost in a 6000+ Highschool. However, because of one single lie Olive's life, reputation and popularity is going to witness some drastic changes.I don't want to give any spoilers. I think this movie is a ""great"" Example on How one lie could lead to another and another till things get really complicated. It's also a good story about how ""Rumors"" can really be deceiving. At first I didn't really ""sympathize"" with Olive it's true she didn't mean for this whole thing to start, she was put into the spot light unwillingly but she didn't do anything to stop it, she actually made it bigger because of some unwise, stupid choices but then I forgave her for it because she saw her mistake eventually.I would recommend this movie to anyone who's currently in high school, I'm sure they will feel very related to the entire story. If your out of high school already, I would suggest you give this movie a try, I'm no longer in HS but watching the film, I had a lot of memories of my HS days the whole gossip, drama and stupidity of teenagers. It just brought back a sense of nostalgia.Overall, great movie and I liked the message behind it. I know some things are made way over the top like there's NO way a school principle is ever going to allow a group of students to yell insults publicly in front of the school building to a particular student's face, but once again it's a movie and even though it won't happen in real life sometimes unspoken words could hurt more than spoken once.I have to agree With Olive, I totally think Pop-Rallys were stupid I'm not so much of a poprally person either but we gotta go out of class so all's fine ;)",5,The Best Highschool Movie since Mean Girls,1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,2267,"['least', 'My', 'Opinion.I', 'know', 'what', 'thinking', 'Not', 'teen', 'movie', 'Well', 'probably', 'right', 'was', 'exactly', 'idea', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'film', 'thoughts', 'were', 'Ok', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'cheesy', 'boring', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'was', 'having', 'headache', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'wanted', 'watch', 'movie', 'just', 'kill', 'time', 'However', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'got', 'surprise', 'guess', 'underestimated', 'movie', 'lot', 'only', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'judge', 'book', 'cover.Olive', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'highschool', 'student', 'California', 'unpopular', 'anonymous', 'completely', 'lost', '6000+', 'Highschool', 'However', 'one', 'single', 'lie', 'Olive', 'life', 'reputation', 'popularity', 'going', 'witness', 'drastic', 'changes.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'spoilers', 'think', 'movie', 'great', 'Example', 'How', 'one', 'lie', 'could', 'lead', 'till', 'things', 'get', 'really', 'complicated', 'also', 'good', 'story', 'how', 'Rumors', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'deceiving', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'sympathize', 'Olive', 'true', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'whole', 'thing', 'start', 'was', 'put', 'spot', 'light', 'unwillingly', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'stop', 'actually', 'made', 'bigger', 'unwise', 'stupid', 'choices', 'then', 'forgave', 'saw', 'mistake', 'eventually.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'currently', 'high', 'school', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'feel', 'very', 'related', 'entire', 'story', 'high', 'school', 'already', 'would', 'suggest', 'give', 'movie', 'try', ""'m"", 'longer', 'HS', 'watching', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'memories', 'HS', 'days', 'whole', 'gossip', 'drama', 'stupidity', 'teenagers', 'just', 'brought', 'back', 'sense', 'nostalgia.Overall', 'great', 'movie', 'liked', 'message', 'know', 'things', 'are', 'made', 'way', 'top', 'way', 'school', 'principle', 'ever', 'going', 'allow', 'group', 'students', 'yell', 'insults', 'publicly', 'front', 'school', 'building', 'particular', 'student', 'face', 'once', 'again', 'movie', 'even', 'wo', ""n't"", 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'sometimes', 'unspoken', 'words', 'could', 'hurt', 'more', 'spoken', 'once.I', 'have', 'agree', 'Olive', 'totally', 'think', 'Pop-Rallys', 'were', 'stupid', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'much', 'poprally', 'person', 'got', 'ta', 'go', 'class', 'fine']",N/A

Those expectations were not only lived up to, but exceeded in the movie. It's probably the smartly informed comedies about teenage life since ""Risky Business.""""Easy A"" is about Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) who under pressure from her best friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka) invents a tryst with a college freshman and word is soon out amongst her schoolmates. As word spreads Olive's friend Brandon (Dan Byrd), who is a target of school bullies because of the possibility of his being gay, asks her to alter this perception by having sex with him. Olive has a better idea that in theory won't compromise her while everyone thinks Brandon has had sex. At a party they fake having a sexual encounter loud enough for everyone to hear. Soon, word is spreading out of control. All of Brandon's nerd friends are soon seeking out Olive to help improve their social reputations, and the school Christians are alternately trying to save Olive, and get her expelled from school. When the consequences of her reputation get beyond her control, instead of trying to alter the mistaken impressions she embraces them wearing a bright red A on her clothing, an idea she got from reading ""The Scarlet Letter"" in English class.There isn't too much adult input into Olive's life, but then what teenagers do? Olive's much too hip parents, played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson, are sympathetic to Olive's plight try to hard to be her friend. Olive's English teacher Mr. Griffith (Thomas Haden Church) who has a good rapport with students unfortunately and unknowingly adds another wrinkle to Olive's problem.Most other reviews compare ""Easy A"" to ""Clueless"" because of the modernization of stories from classic literature (in ""Clueless"" case Jane Austen's ""Emma""). But I think ""Easy A"" may be the ""Risky Business"" of the internet generation. Both ""Easy A"" and ""Risky Business"" are taking on much the same problem, and using some unconventional techniques in the telling of the story. Joel's problem in ""Risky Business"" is much the same as Olive's in ""Easy A."" Both Joel and Olive want to enhance their sexual reputations among their peers in the hope that some of that peer pressure will dissolve away. Both films don't approach the subject in conventional terms. In ""Risky Business"" Joel's dreams and fantasies are equally important as his reality. Olive relates her story via a webcast. Where Joel's problem is every adolescent boy's fantasy, Olive's problem are the nightmare of every teenage girl. Music is also important in both films Tangerine Dream added an unorthodox soundtrack to ""Risky Businesss"" as the soundtrack in ""Easy A.""  And like ""Risky Business"" ""Easy A"" exceeds all expectations of the genre, and even stands some of those expectations on their ear.Special Features include a commentary with director Will Gluck and Emma Stone, a gag reel, and Stone's audition video.",5,Best Teen Comedy Since Risky Business,1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,2985,"['Going', 'watching', 'Easy', 'A', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'many', 'expectations', 'hopefully', 'seeing', 'good', 'movie', 'expectations', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'lived', 'up', 'exceeded', 'movie', 'probably', 'smartly', 'informed', 'comedies', 'teenage', 'life', 'Risky', 'Business', 'Easy', 'A', 'about', 'Olive', 'Penderghast', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'who', 'pressure', 'best', 'friend', 'Rhiannon', 'Alyson', 'Michalka', 'tryst', 'college', 'freshman', 'word', 'soon', 'out', 'schoolmates', 'word', 'Olive', 'friend', 'Brandon', 'Dan', 'Byrd', 'who', 'target', 'school', 'bullies', 'possibility', 'being', 'gay', 'alter', 'perception', 'having', 'sex', 'Olive', 'better', 'idea', 'theory', 'wo', ""n't"", 'compromise', 'everyone', 'Brandon', 'had', 'sex', 'party', 'fake', 'having', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'loud', 'enough', 'everyone', 'hear', 'Soon', 'word', 'spreading', 'control', 'Brandon', 'nerd', 'friends', 'are', 'soon', 'seeking', 'out', 'Olive', 'help', 'improve', 'social', 'reputations', 'school', 'Christians', 'are', 'alternately', 'trying', 'save', 'Olive', 'get', 'expelled', 'school', 'When', 'consequences', 'reputation', 'get', 'control', 'instead', 'trying', 'alter', 'mistaken', 'impressions', 'wearing', 'bright', 'red', 'A', 'clothing', 'idea', 'got', 'reading', 'Scarlet', 'Letter', 'English', 'class.There', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', 'adult', 'input', 'Olive', 'life', 'then', 'what', 'teenagers', 'do', 'Olive', 'much', 'too', 'hip', 'parents', 'played', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'Olive', 'plight', 'try', 'hard', 'be', 'friend', 'Olive', 'English', 'Mr.', 'Griffith', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'who', 'good', 'rapport', 'students', 'unfortunately', 'unknowingly', 'wrinkle', 'Olive', 'problem.Most', 'other', 'reviews', 'compare', 'Easy', 'A', 'Clueless', 'modernization', 'stories', 'classic', 'literature', 'Clueless', 'case', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Emma', 'think', 'Easy', 'may', 'be', 'Risky', 'Business', 'internet', 'generation', 'Easy', 'A', 'Risky', 'Business', 'are', 'taking', 'much', 'same', 'problem', 'using', 'unconventional', 'techniques', 'telling', 'story', 'Joel', 'problem', 'Risky', 'Business', 'much', 'same', 'Olive', 'Easy', 'A', 'Joel', 'Olive', 'want', 'enhance', 'sexual', 'reputations', 'peers', 'hope', 'peer', 'pressure', 'will', 'dissolve', 'away', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'approach', 'subject', 'conventional', 'terms', 'Risky', 'Business', 'Joel', 'dreams', 'fantasies', 'are', 'equally', 'important', 'reality', 'Olive', 'story', 'webcast', 'Where', 'Joel', 'problem', 'adolescent', 'boy', 'fantasy', 'Olive', 'problem', 'are', 'nightmare', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Music', 'also', 'important', 'films', 'Tangerine', 'Dream', 'added', 'unorthodox', 'soundtrack', 'Risky', 'Businesss', 'soundtrack', 'Easy', 'A', 'Risky', 'Business', 'Easy', 'A', 'expectations', 'genre', 'even', 'expectations', 'ear.Special', 'Features', 'include', 'commentary', 'director', 'Will', 'Gluck', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'gag', 'reel', 'Stone', 'audition', 'video']",N/A

1328384,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B0036TGSIK,Kenya Starflight,"[0, 0]","Despite looking pretty much like every other teen comedy out there (at least on the cover), ""Easy A"" seems to be a fairly ambitious movie.  It wants to be a modern adaptation of ""The Scarlet Letter,"" a classic novel that is nonetheless a rather difficult read and has been butchered in transition to the big screen before.  It also seems to be trying to be a homage to the John Hughes teen movies of the '80s, making references and even using scenes from said movies (especially ""Sixteen Candles,"" ""The Breakfast Club,"" and ""Ferris Beuller's Day Off"").  But above all it seems to want to make a statement and offer commentary on sexuality... and how women, teen girls especially, are held to a different sort of standard than men and teen boys.  And all while being a funny and entertaining flick.  Quite a large bite for a single movie to chew.Does ""Easy A"" succeed at its multiple aims?  Well... mostly.  But even where it falls short, it's still an enjoyable movie, and definitely one that keeps you thinking after the credits have rolled.Olive Penderghast is a virtual nobody at her California high school, invisible to most of the school save Rhiannon, her hyperactive best friend who's sort of a jerk, and Todd, an old crush who now plays the school's mascot.  When she fibs her way out of a camping trip with Rhiannon's weird parents, Rhiannon misinterprets her recap of the weekend to imply that she lost her virginity, and ends up spreading the news throughout the school.  Soon Olive is seen as the school slut, a reputation she doesn't exactly help herself when she starts offering to pretend to sleep with guys to help them improve their social standing (including a rather hilarious scene where she pretends to sleep with a classmate at a party to rebuff rumors that he's gay).  At first she accepts her sudden notoriety, even if it's for the wrong reasons... but soon comes to realize that the attention she's getting is destroying her and others, especially when the local Christian fundamentalists set their sights on her and when a philandering school counselor sides against her.  Can she set things right, and salvage some of her mangled reputation in the process?The parallels between ""Easy A"" and ""The Scarlet Letter"" are fairly obvious, and even referenced throughout the film (with a few potshots taken at the lousy '90s film adaptation).  Whether this works for the viewer is really up to them, and personally I found the film probably could have stood better on its own merits instead of claiming to be an adaptation.That aside, however, this is still a fairly solid movie, with decent acting all around.  Emma Stone is wonderful as the delightfully snarky Olive, keeping her head high and wicked humor intact even as her world comes crumbling down around her.  Her family was quite enjoyable as well, not feeling forced or corny like so many families in teen movies, and with some of the most hilarious parents ever.  Amanda Bynes plays a rather ironic role as the ringleader of the local Christian group, and is an interesting blend of annoyingly perky and backstabbingly evil.  Most of the male roles in this movie, even Woodchuck Todd, are fairly bland and forgettable, sadly, with only Thomas Haden Church as a funny English teacher and Malcolm McDowell as the hardnosed, homophobic principal standing out.The film itself is quite enjoyable, funny throughout but also being touching and emotional when it needs to be -- though an attempted date-rape scene in the latter third of the film is rather jarring and can break one out of the lighthearted mood of the rest of the film.  The film isn't afraid to poke fun at itself or at the clich&eacute;s of its genre -- Olive even bemoans that her life isn't more like a John Hughes movie -- and many teens will probably find certain facts true to life, such as how quickly rumors can spread and mutate.  It also deconstructs and explores the double-standard regarding sexuality and virginity -- men increase their social standing in this film by claiming they slept with Olive, while Olive herself is demonized as a ""slut"" after a single one-night stand, even before she starts allowing men to claim they slept with her.If I have any nitpicks with the film, it's that once again Christians are typecast as stubborn, arrogant, and ignorant, to the point where they serve as the primary antagonists of the movie.  And of course, the film is quick to point them out as hypocrites -- one joins the fight to ""save"" Olive from her ""wicked ways,"" only to contract chlamydia from having an affair with the school guidance counselor.  People, not all Christians are as judgmental and self-important as this film makes them out to be.Nitpicks aside, however, this is a fun, mostly lighthearted film, one that isn't afraid to tackle a bigger issue and actually manages to do it competently without getting bogged down in a ""moral"" of any sort.  It's not anything earth-shattering, but it's a step up from most teen comedy fare and a good deal cleaner than most despite the subject matter.  Probably best for ages 14 and up due to language, sexual references, and at least one drug reference.",4,Ambitious but still light-hearted and fun teen comedy,1381190400,"10 8,

Things get even worse when a Bible-thumping idiot on the ten year graduation plan covers his infidelity by telling everyone that Olive gave him an STD.All the knots get unraveled in the end, and everybody lives happily ever after, as might be expected in this fizzy little movie, which is far, far better than it's storyline would suggest. A good deal of the credit for the quality comes from the incredibly talented cast, which features Lisa Kudrow, Stanley Tucci, Amanda Bynes, Patricia Clarkson, Thomas Hayden Church, Malcolm MacDowell, and Emma Stone, who received a Golden Globe nomination for this role.Emma, who has a very strong resemblance to Lindsay Lohan B.T. (Before Trainwreck) is somebody we will be seeing again, hopefully often. As the quick-witted Olive, Emma entertains everybody involved in this film, including the audience, the cast and crew, and even, most impressively, herself, as she enjoys Oliving her way through the story.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",4,The Scarlet Letter,1304467200,"05 4, 2011",2011,1455,"['reading', 'THE', 'SCARLET', 'LETTER', 'High', 'School', 'English', 'class', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'Olive', 'Prendergast', 'spread', 'untrue', 'news', 'had', 'sex', 'guy', 'local', 'Community', 'College', 'little', 'spice', 'story', 'faking', 'sex', 'few', 'in-the-closet', 'gay', 'male', 'friends.Before', 'straight', 'boys', 'knocking', 'down', 'door', 'girls', 'picketing', 'Slut', 'signs', 'Things', 'get', 'hand', 'when', 'high', 'school', 'hotshot', 'date', 'rape', 'Things', 'get', 'even', 'worse', 'when', 'Bible-thumping', 'idiot', 'ten', 'year', 'graduation', 'plan', 'infidelity', 'telling', 'everyone', 'Olive', 'gave', 'STD.All', 'knots', 'get', 'unraveled', 'end', 'everybody', 'happily', 'ever', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'fizzy', 'little', 'movie', 'far', 'far', 'better', 'storyline', 'would', 'suggest', 'good', 'deal', 'credit', 'quality', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'cast', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'Malcolm', 'MacDowell', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'who', 'received', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nomination', 'role.Emma', 'who', 'very', 'strong', 'resemblance', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'B.T', 'Trainwreck', 'somebody', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'again', 'hopefully', 'often', 'quick-witted', 'Olive', 'Emma', 'everybody', 'involved', 'film', 'including', 'audience', 'cast', 'crew', 'even', 'most', 'impressively', 'Oliving', 'way', 'story.HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A

Emma Stone plays Olive Pendergast, a clean cut high school student who blends in with the crowd.  There is nothing special about her, although she is attractive.  All of a sudden she becomes the center of attention as the high school rumor mill feeds on a white lie she told a friend about a week-end date with a college student.  Olive stayed home with her family that week-end, but upon returning to class the rumor spreads like wildfire and she becomes the center of attention. Olive adamently denies she did anything wrong, but this just adds fuel to the wild stories.  Finally she decides to just enjoy her notariety and embrace her new risque image.  Other students come to her to help their wild reputation (although everyone is being good - they just want a reputation).  They pay her to say she had her way with them. Olive helps the situation by wearing sexy new clothes with a red ""A"" on her chest.  It becomes overwhelming - Olive is the most talked about person now. The rumor mill becomes too much for her and she is afraid it will hurt her family and the only high school relationship she cares about.

Not so with Easy A. It manages to be smart, funny and original, and appeal to a much wider audience than just teens.Olive Prendergast is a smart good girl with a clean reputation.  When she fibs to a friend about an intimate weekend with an imaginary boyfriend, and another girl overhears, it sets in motion a series of events that speak volumes about high school life.Her flawless reputation gets ruined, but she seems unperturbed by this.  In fact, word trickles through the grapevine, boys approach her, ask her to help out their love lives by agreeing to be their pretend  girlfriend, and improve their reputations.  At once this movie is part satire and part social commentary.  If you have read the recent news about teen suicides, you will realise that your status and how are perceived are both important, in the high school setting.An interesting analogy is drawn between this movie and the Scarlet Letter, where a woman's reputation gets ruined by a scandalous affair and she becomes ostracised and condemned by her community, even sentenced to be hanged.  Olive wears the scarlet letter A with easy pride becoming her own social experiment.  She gets ostracised, scolded by the moral police and survives.  Ironically, other people get better reputations because of her bad reputation, and that's all it is - reputation.It makes you wonder about the double standard between boys and girls.  If a boy does the same thing, he's the man, he gets high fives, and gains status.  You may wonder if she will be able to save her reputation, and how she would save it.  It's a good thing to wonder.Much hypocrisy gets exposed along the way.  If you like to watch a movie that goes a little deeper than the usual teen movie, watch this one.  It's one of the best I have seen.  Emma Stone ofZombielandplays the lead, and does an extraordinary job. If you wish to see more  Emma Stone check outPaper Man, where she steals the show in a breakout role.  Amanda Bynes, plays the moral policewoman.

Olive is articulate, grounded and quick with a retort - and definitely not a loose woman who goes with any boy behind the bike shed. In fact her virginity is still 'secretly' intact. Her best friend however is Marianne who hasn't had any part of her anatomy intact for quite some time (a scene-stealing part for Alison Michalka). Marianne has temptress hair, an ample bosom and tight blouses that show you her credentials in no uncertain terms. Possessed of a trashy mouth and practically the campus trollop, Marianne can't wait for her friend Olive to lose her cherry. So in an attempt to alleviate her constant vocal pressurizing, Olive tells Marianne that she has done 'it' at the weekend. She gives Marianne all the necessary details. Big mistake...Next day, Olive's gay friend Brandon (Dan Byrd) hears the delicious news (along with the rest of campus) and is thrilled. He spots an opportunity. Brandon can't stand the pretence any more and asks Olive (in her new found waywardness) to fake making out with him so he can be accepted by all the fit hetro guys in collage. Olive agrees because she feels for Brandon. They stage a hysterically funny make out scene in a bedroom at a party with everyone listening at the door. He emerges as the male stud and hero to the lads. Soon the rumour mill starts and via the net and mobile phones, Olive attains a reputation as sleep-around-central. But then her goer status escalates, bringing down the religious nuts on her immoral ass (a great performance by Amanda Bynes) which causes Olive all sorts of grief - including even losing Todd (Penn Badgley) her childhood pal and real love. So what started out as a harmless joke in a toilet and a helping hand given to a friend in need - turns into a cottage industry that escalates out of control. It's very funny, spunky and consistently entertaining.To hold your own as a lead in something like ""Easy-A"" takes real gumption and dare we say it - starpower - and Emma Stone has it. She is just gorgeous in this film - funny, playful and luminous in a way that an actress hasn't been in a very long time. It's a breakthrough part for her. Throw in a great supporting cast like Stanley Tucci (her father), Thomas Haden Church (her teacher), Patricia Clarkson (her mother), Lisa Kudrow (the collage councillor) and Malcolm McDowell (the collage Principal) to name but a few, genuinely cool jokes and one-liners and a jab or two at the tyrants who want to run our lives - and you have a winner on your hands.The BLU RAY image is beautiful too - and there are some great extras with the cast and crew.I loved ""Easy-A"" - it's young, it's funny, it's ballsy and sexy too.Do yourself a favour and put it high on your rental/to buy list.",5,"""...If You Hear A Rumour That I Have Chlamydia...Just Ignore It...""",1299369600,"03 6, 2011",2011,2891,"['Easy-A', 'superb', 'witty', 'incredibly', 'fresh', 'coming-of-age', 'flick', 'razor-sharp', 'script.Olive', 'Penderghast', 'intelligent', 'twenty-something', 'woman', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Olive', 'articulate', 'grounded', 'quick', 'retort', 'definitely', 'not', 'loose', 'woman', 'who', 'boy', 'bike', 'shed', 'fact', 'virginity', 'still', ""'secretly"", 'intact', 'best', 'friend', 'however', 'Marianne', 'who', ""n't"", 'had', 'part', 'anatomy', 'intact', 'quite', 'time', 'scene-stealing', 'part', 'Alison', 'Michalka', 'Marianne', 'temptress', 'hair', 'ample', 'bosom', 'tight', 'blouses', 'show', 'credentials', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'Possessed', 'trashy', 'mouth', 'practically', 'campus', 'trollop', 'Marianne', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'friend', 'Olive', 'lose', 'cherry', 'So', 'attempt', 'alleviate', 'constant', 'vocal', 'pressurizing', 'Olive', 'Marianne', 'done', 'weekend', 'Marianne', 'necessary', 'details', 'Big', 'mistake', 'Next', 'day', 'Olive', 'gay', 'friend', 'Brandon', 'Dan', 'Byrd', 'delicious', 'news', 'rest', 'campus', 'thrilled', 'spots', 'opportunity', 'Brandon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'pretence', 'more', 'Olive', 'new', 'found', 'waywardness', 'fake', 'making', 'out', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'accepted', 'fit', 'hetro', 'guys', 'collage', 'Olive', 'agrees', 'Brandon', 'stage', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'make', 'out', 'scene', 'bedroom', 'party', 'everyone', 'listening', 'door', 'male', 'stud', 'hero', 'lads', 'Soon', 'rumour', 'mill', 'net', 'mobile', 'phones', 'Olive', 'reputation', 'sleep-around-central', 'then', 'goer', 'status', 'bringing', 'down', 'religious', 'nuts', 'immoral', 'ass', 'great', 'performance', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'Olive', 'sorts', 'grief', 'including', 'even', 'losing', 'Todd', 'Penn', 'Badgley', 'childhood', 'pal', 'real', 'love', 'what', 'started', 'out', 'harmless', 'joke', 'toilet', 'helping', 'hand', 'given', 'friend', 'cottage', 'industry', 'control', 'very', 'funny', 'spunky', 'consistently', 'entertaining.To', 'hold', 'own', 'lead', 'something', 'Easy-A', 'real', 'gumption', 'dare', 'say', 'starpower', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'just', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'funny', 'playful', 'luminous', 'way', 'actress', ""n't"", 'been', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'breakthrough', 'part', 'Throw', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'father', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'teacher', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'mother', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'collage', 'councillor', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'collage', 'Principal', 'name', 'few', 'genuinely', 'cool', 'jokes', 'one-liners', 'jab', 'two', 'tyrants', 'who', 'want', 'run', 'lives', 'have', 'winner', 'hands.The', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'image', 'beautiful', 'too', 'are', 'great', 'extras', 'cast', 'crew.I', 'loved', 'Easy-A', 'young', 'funny', 'ballsy', 'sexy', 'too.Do', 'favour', 'put', 'high', 'rental/to', 'buy', 'list']",N/A
1328398,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0036TGSIK,Mark Turner,"[3, 4]","Not many people will recall the book they had to read in English years past THE SCARLET LETTER. But you'll remember it (or one of the versions you watched to pass class) when watching EASY A. In part because it references it often but also because of the affectionate twist it uses here mingling the Nathaniel Hawthorne classic with a bit of John Hughes infected use of the high school arena.Emma Stone stars as Olive, a young girl easing her way through high school, never coming in on anyone's radar and having a relatively easy time. That all changes with the little white lie she tells her best friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka). In an attempt to avoid spending the weekend with her new age family, Olive tells Rhia that she had a date with a college student.But of course Rhia twists into not just a date but an entire weekend that ends with Olive's loss of virginity to this fictional date. To make matters worse, Rhia drags this so called confession out of Olive in the girl's rest room where Holy Roller Marianne (Amanda Bynes) was using a stall. In the age of texting and cell phones, the rumor travels at light speed and soon everyone believes Olive is the tramp of all tramps.Things get even more complicated after Olive goes off on Marianne's friend and ends up in detention. Fellow detentionee Brandon is constantly picked on because the school thinks he's gay, which he is. He just would rather not deal with the bullying. Olive lets Brandon know how the rumor started without any factual basis and suggest he do the same, telling people he scored with some female student. Of course he convinces the good hearted Olive into pretending she was his conquest. A fake liaison behind closed doors at a party and the word spreads once more.But this leads to more problems as Brandon tells various friends about the arrangement he had with Olive. Now more misfits come to her asking for the same favor paying with gift cards from various stores. The deeper Olive gets into the lie, the more Marianne seeks to remove her and her rumor inspired activities from the school. Not only that, Rhia turns her back on her friend when she takes center stage instead of her.All of this escalates to a point where the notoriety soon becomes more than Olive can handle. Toss in the lies affecting her favorite teacher and the dream of one day becoming involved with the boy she's had a crush on for years and you can see where this is going.The solution Olive comes up with is original and inspired (as I said) by the many movies John Hughes made involving teens in trouble like SIXTEEN CANDLES and PRETTY IN PINK with a nice play on the film SAY ANYTHING. These movies all presented us with a world where every teen character had a problem that was solved by the end of the film. The same happens here. It's the journey that makes it worth watching.The movie is funny, touching and a nice look at the world of teen rumors, gossiping and hurtful ways. With any luck, teens watching the film will come away thinking twice about the things they say and text.Emma Stone is marvelous here, offering that young girl quality so necessary to the character as well as the innocence of the things she sets in motion. Her smile lights up the screen when she has those moments where she gets to show the real character of Olive rather than the fake one she offers the students.The movie offers plenty of laughs and some tender moments as well while taking swipes at those who would consider themselves above the rest and morally superior to everyone around them. In truth, everyone has a side they'd rather not let the rest of the world see.

Some fellows like to see others venture into uncharted territories for the sake of testing the limits. Others have the imagination and shrewdness to create fictional scenarios that help them get along with peer pressure. When fiction and realities collide, the herd gets a sense of the loose boundaries of their relationships. Each member of the heard has his/her defense mechanisms.  Some are more comfortable with their confusion than others.Confusion about sex, God, love, friendship, and their role in society was a product of family, teachers, media, and the obligation of conforming to the school rules. One child's family that was excessively promiscuous led to a child that is obsessed with her parents' delusion. Another child with religious upbringing struggled between reality and the abstract of religion.Both youth and adults faced different challenges, but all challenges were compounded with the views imposed by others rather than the immediate combatants.

I enjoyed the comedy aspect as well and the writers on the movie did a great job at making it funny.  There might have been music in the movie, but honestly it was secondary and I didn't pay attention to it obviously.  Definitely not important to the overall premise of the movie though so its not too much of a negative.Overall it was a good movie.  Somewhat unrealistic at times but still funny.  I enjoyed it.Review by M.

1328420,A11B6LNU5MS6V,B0036TGSIK,N. Sturm,"[0, 0]","I did consider rating Easy A a bit lower, because it's certainly far from perfect.  But I had to take into consideration that it's just so *watchable*, and has been my go to movie for awhile now when I'm really bored, and after seeing it I think six times I still am not really tired of it.  Easy A is frequently paired with Mean Girls, in that both seem to be satires of social and sexual politics in high school, but I must say I loathe Mean Girls.  As far as I can tell Easy A is more intelligent, less pretentious, and less overall annoying than MG by a long shot.  While it does make some huge assumptions about the behavior of teens to drive its plot, and relies on stereotypes at times, it can raise some interesting questions about conformity or whatever.  Maybe the ideas Easy A addresses aren't new, but that isn't how satire works in the first place.I excuse a number of Easy A's issues-- stereotypes, assumptions, and the need for a fair amount of suspension of disbelief-- by assuming that it's intended as a farce.  Here's the definition of a farce from Wikipedia, not because I assume you don't know it but because it fits the movie so goshdarn perfect: a comedy that aims at entertaining the audience by means of unlikely, extravagant, and improbable situations, disguise and mistaken identity, verbal humor of varying degrees of sophistication, which may include word play, and a fast-paced plot whose speed usually increases.  So it doesn't matter that in real life, the *entire* school would never care about one girl's (boring at first) sexual exploits.  It's just a plot device to make a point about how society views men having sex in a more positive light than women doing it. As for the stereotypical Christian characters, yeah, I can see how the depiction would be offensive to some.  Should they have been more fleshed out?  Yeah, probably, but I'm not sure there was *time*.  Again, they served a narrative purpose.  Though packaged as a silly teen comedy, this was a movie with something to say.That all sounded iffy, so here's some stuff I definitely like: first of all, I was pretty happy with how they wrote the gay kid.  He had some depth.  He was sympathetic.  UNLIKE the supposedly gay boy in Mean Girls, he did *not* kiss a *girl*, and was actually shown to have a boyfriend at the end of the movie.  So that's cool.  I don't know what he's doing for money, since he ran away from home, but we'll assume he's got something worked out.  I also liked the way the film was structured as a webcast, and Emma Stone's performance-- of course.  There were some truly affecting moments with her character, like when she admitted in confession that everyone hated her, and she kind of hated herself as well; also when she and Brandon had a moment after their supposed tryst at the party.  He was really grateful and all, but I don't think it made up for how everybody stared at her when she left the room.  That brings me to Todd.  He was actually waaaaay more understanding than the main character deserved, and certainly a candidate for most tolerant (boy)friend ever.  Finally, I don't know if the climactic scene with the musical number is a thing that would happen in real life, but it was an homage to '80s movies in the first place and it was also really cool.So overall, I can understand some criticism of this movie, but I still like it a lot. It seems to be the sort of teen girl movie that a lot of guys can appreciate, and I'm not entirely sure why that is, but it's awesome.  Now if only people weren't willing to gut me for dumping on Mean Girls.  Talk about your stupid stereotypes, but that is neither here nor there.  Easy A gets a 3.5.  It would get a 4 if I didn't actually think that Christians had a point in feeling offended by it.",4,"More like 3 1/2 stars, but hey.",1354838400,"12 7, 2012",2012,3779,"['did', 'consider', 'rating', 'Easy', 'A', 'bit', 'lower', 'certainly', 'far', 'perfect', 'had', 'take', 'consideration', 'just', 'so', '*watchable*', 'been', 'go', 'movie', 'awhile', 'now', 'when', ""'m"", 'really', 'bored', 'seeing', 'think', 'six', 'times', 'still', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'tired', 'Easy', 'A', 'frequently', 'paired', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'seem', 'be', 'satires', 'social', 'sexual', 'politics', 'high', 'school', 'must', 'say', 'loathe', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'As', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'Easy', 'A', 'more', 'intelligent', 'less', 'pretentious', 'less', 'overall', 'annoying', 'MG', 'long', 'shot', 'make', 'huge', 'assumptions', 'behavior', 'teens', 'drive', 'plot', 'relies', 'stereotypes', 'times', 'can', 'raise', 'interesting', 'questions', 'conformity', 'Maybe', 'ideas', 'Easy', 'A', 'addresses', 'are', ""n't"", 'new', ""n't"", 'how', 'satire', 'first', 'place.I', 'excuse', 'number', 'Easy', 'A', 'issues', 'stereotypes', 'assumptions', 'need', 'fair', 'amount', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'assuming', 'intended', 'farce', 'Here', 'definition', 'farce', 'Wikipedia', 'not', 'assume', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'so', 'goshdarn', 'perfect', 'comedy', 'entertaining', 'audience', 'means', 'unlikely', 'extravagant', 'improbable', 'situations', 'disguise', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'verbal', 'humor', 'varying', 'degrees', 'sophistication', 'may', 'include', 'word', 'play', 'fast-paced', 'plot', 'speed', 'usually', ""n't"", 'matter', 'real', 'life', '*entire*', 'school', 'would', 'never', 'care', 'one', 'girl', 'boring', 'first', 'sexual', 'exploits', 'just', 'plot', 'device', 'make', 'point', 'how', 'society', 'views', 'men', 'having', 'sex', 'more', 'positive', 'light', 'women', 'doing', 'stereotypical', 'Christian', 'characters', 'yeah', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'depiction', 'would', 'be', 'offensive', 'Should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fleshed', 'Yeah', 'probably', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', '*time*', 'Again', 'served', 'narrative', 'purpose', 'Though', 'packaged', 'silly', 'teen', 'comedy', 'was', 'movie', 'something', 'say.That', 'sounded', 'iffy', 'here', 'stuff', 'definitely', 'first', 'was', 'pretty', 'happy', 'how', 'wrote', 'gay', 'kid', 'had', 'depth', 'was', 'sympathetic', 'supposedly', 'gay', 'boy', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'did', '*not*', 'kiss', '*girl*', 'was', 'actually', 'shown', 'have', 'boyfriend', 'end', 'movie', 'cool', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'doing', 'money', 'ran', 'away', 'home', ""'ll"", 'assume', 'got', 'something', 'worked', 'out', 'also', 'liked', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'structured', 'webcast', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'performance', 'course', 'were', 'truly', 'affecting', 'moments', 'character', 'when', 'admitted', 'confession', 'everyone', 'hated', 'kind', 'hated', 'herself', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'when', 'Brandon', 'had', 'moment', 'supposed', 'tryst', 'party', 'was', 'really', 'grateful', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'made', 'up', 'how', 'everybody', 'stared', 'when', 'left', 'room', 'Todd', 'was', 'actually', 'waaaaay', 'more', 'understanding', 'main', 'character', 'deserved', 'certainly', 'candidate', 'most', 'tolerant', 'boy', 'friend', 'ever', 'Finally', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'climactic', 'scene', 'musical', 'number', 'thing', 'would', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'homage', ""'80s"", 'movies', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'also', 'really', 'cool.So', 'overall', 'can', 'understand', 'criticism', 'movie', 'still', 'lot', 'be', 'sort', 'teen', 'girl', 'movie', 'lot', 'guys', 'can', 'appreciate', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'why', 'awesome', 'Now', 'only', 'people', 'were', ""n't"", 'willing', 'gut', 'dumping', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'Talk', 'stupid', 'stereotypes', 'neither', 'here', 'there', 'Easy', 'A', '3.5', 'would', 'get', '4', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'think', 'Christians', 'had', 'point', 'feeling', 'offended']",N/A

So she invents a sexual partner. Suddenly she has a ""reputation"" as the school floozy. She is reading Hawthorn's ""the Scarlet Letter"" in English - probably the only one in her class of morons who is, and she improbably decides to cut out a bright red ""A"" and attach it to her top. She runs afoul of the Campus Christians with Opinions...The jokes and situations go on from there.  She decides to flaunt it to make a point, dresses the part, she has a seemingly vast collection of bustiers, corsets, with red A's and impossibly high platform wedgies (which I am reliably informed, by Lisa, are now called ""wedge heels"").

I'd heard good things about it, but it was Emma Stone that sold me on the purchase. She's always such a doll in her films. From Super Bad to Gangster Squad to The Amazing Spider Man, she's always come off very likeable even if her character wasn't all that great.The script itself is well written and has some very spiky banter throughout. For a movie that was shot on a budget of only 8 million dollars, it also boasts some fairly solid production value. Emma, as usually, does a very good job playing the teen who starts off as average only to soon be labeled the school harlot. While she wasn't always the source of all the jokes, the timing she had with her co stars was spot on. It felt very natural for her to be in this role. While you will not doubt recognize many of the other stars in the film, none stick out more than Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson who play the parents. There is obvious chemistry there and their time on screen is often filled with witty banter and off the cuff advice that makes a lot of sense.Thomas Hayden Church was likeable and he filled his role quite well. It was a big change from the last film I'd seen him in (Sideways), but he pulled it off nicely. Lisa Kudrow also did well as the philandering guidance counselor...and then there is Amanda Bynes. Putting aside all the recent news about her and her personal problems, she did pretty well in this film. Her scene were often awkward, but that was the idea behind them. She may not have been the headlining star in this picture, but I don't think she should feel any sort of shame for her performance here.Overall, the film was enjoyable and funny and something that has actual moral lessons that aren't thrown in your face. Some scenes were a little too silly, but the witty dialog makes up for some of the awkwardness.As far as the Blu Ray Transfer, the picture was very good. There was very little grain and the coloring was spot on. My only issue was it felt at times that the sound did not match up with the picture. It felt as if it were off for maybe half a second during a couple of scenes so be aware of that. For me, it wasn't too much of a distraction as that issue was only present for about 5 minutes of the film.4.2 / 5",4,A Very Likable Cast with A Good Story,1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,2276,"['was', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'blu', 'ray', '8', ""'d"", 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'was', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'sold', 'purchase', 'always', 'such', 'doll', 'films', 'Super', 'Bad', 'Gangster', 'Squad', 'Amazing', 'Spider', 'Man', 'always', 'come', 'off', 'very', 'likeable', 'even', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'great.The', 'script', 'well', 'written', 'very', 'spiky', 'banter', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'budget', 'only', '8', 'million', 'dollars', 'also', 'fairly', 'solid', 'production', 'value', 'Emma', 'usually', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'teen', 'who', 'off', 'average', 'only', 'soon', 'be', 'labeled', 'school', 'harlot', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'source', 'jokes', 'timing', 'had', 'co', 'stars', 'was', 'spot', 'felt', 'very', 'natural', 'be', 'role', 'will', 'not', 'doubt', 'recognize', 'many', 'other', 'stars', 'film', 'none', 'stick', 'out', 'more', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'who', 'play', 'parents', 'obvious', 'chemistry', 'time', 'screen', 'often', 'filled', 'witty', 'banter', 'cuff', 'advice', 'lot', 'sense.Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'was', 'likeable', 'filled', 'role', 'quite', 'well', 'was', 'big', 'change', 'last', 'film', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Sideways', 'pulled', 'off', 'nicely', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'also', 'did', 'well', 'philandering', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'then', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'Putting', 'recent', 'news', 'personal', 'problems', 'did', 'pretty', 'well', 'film', 'scene', 'were', 'often', 'awkward', 'was', 'idea', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'headlining', 'star', 'picture', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'feel', 'sort', 'shame', 'performance', 'here.Overall', 'film', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'funny', 'something', 'actual', 'moral', 'lessons', 'are', ""n't"", 'thrown', 'face', 'scenes', 'were', 'little', 'too', 'silly', 'witty', 'dialog', 'up', 'awkwardness.As', 'far', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Transfer', 'picture', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'grain', 'coloring', 'was', 'spot', 'only', 'issue', 'was', 'felt', 'times', 'sound', 'did', 'not', 'match', 'up', 'picture', 'felt', 'were', 'off', 'maybe', 'second', 'couple', 'scenes', 'so', 'be', 'aware', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', 'distraction', 'issue', 'was', 'only', 'present', '5', 'minutes', 'film.4.2', '5']",N/A

1328436,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0036TGSIK,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[31, 37]","Easy A (Will Gluck, 2010)I usually see movies alone, but every once in a while we do the family-movie thing, which generally limits my choices. It usually takes forever to decide on something when we do this, but sometimes it all ends up working out well. This was one of those times. I had some ideas about Easy A going into it that were as wrong as could be; I saw the name (I'd never seen trailers for it) and assumed it was one of those ""your classmate dies and everyone gets a good grade"" kinds of things. No, and thank heaven for that. It is something much different, and a good deal better than any of those (with the arguable exception of The Curve).Olive Penderghast (Zombieland's Emma Stone) is your typical invisible high schooler, noticed only by her best friend Rhiannon (Phil of the Future's Alyson Michalka). Things change when Olive, spinning a very tall tale for Rhiannon in the bathroom as an excuse to get out of a camping trip, is overheard by Marianne (Hairspray's Amanda Bynes), the head of the ultra-Christian contingent of the student body, who starts the rumor mill flying. Olive decides to adopt the ""if you can't beat 'em"" attitude and dressing the part (without ever actually doing anything actually, you know, salacious). All is well and good until she confesses the lie to Brandon (Cougar Town's Dan Byrd), the school's only gay teen, who hatches a plan; since Olive is not only straight, but now seen as a tramp, telling people he's been with her could give his image a makeover, too. She agrees to help, but the consequences are much father-reaching than she could ever have anticipated.The synopsis doesn't get you anywhere close to the great cast this movie supports. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson play Olive's parents (Dill and Rosemary, no less), and are the best part about the movie every time they're on the screen. Thomas Haden Church and Lisa Kudrow play a husband-and-wife English teacher and guidance counselor at Olive's high school. Cam Gigandet takes a break from doing below-average horror flicks to take a turn as Marianne's boyfriend, a 22-year-old who's repeating senior year for the fourth time. This is good stuff indeed from a casting perspective, but how's the script? It's hard to believe this is Bert Royal's first feature; this is as sharp and as witty as the John Hughes movies Olive idolizes. (The Quizno's guy, and nice product placement there by the by, is as funny as the ball-waxer in Gutterballs, and that's saying something for a guy who has two lines; for the record it's Rawson Thurber, director of The Mysteries of Pittsburgh.)Sure, the movie has its problems. It's a teen comedy John Hughes-style, of course it has its problems. There are a number of times when the script could have gone in very interesting directions and instead chose to go the conventional route (especially where Marianne is concerned; she could have been an interesting character, but instead remains a one-dimensional object of audience ridicule), for example. And when did the clause in Patricia Clarkson's contract that required a nude scene in every movie run out? Someone's got to get that renewed. But for all that, it's smart, it's funny, and you should give it a look. *** ",4,Surprisingly good.,1286409600,"10 7, 2010",2010,3229,"['Easy', 'A', 'Will', 'Gluck', '2010', 'usually', 'see', 'movies', 'alone', 'once', 'while', 'do', 'family-movie', 'thing', 'generally', 'choices', 'usually', 'forever', 'decide', 'something', 'when', 'do', 'up', 'working', 'out', 'well', 'was', 'one', 'times', 'had', 'ideas', 'Easy', 'A', 'going', 'were', 'as', 'wrong', 'could', 'be', 'saw', 'name', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'trailers', 'assumed', 'was', 'one', 'classmate', 'dies', 'everyone', 'good', 'grade', 'kinds', 'things', 'No', 'thank', 'heaven', 'something', 'much', 'different', 'good', 'deal', 'better', 'arguable', 'exception', 'Curve', '.Olive', 'Penderghast', 'Zombieland', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'typical', 'invisible', 'high', 'schooler', 'noticed', 'only', 'best', 'friend', 'Rhiannon', 'Phil', 'Future', 'Alyson', 'Michalka', 'Things', 'change', 'when', 'Olive', 'spinning', 'very', 'tall', 'tale', 'Rhiannon', 'bathroom', 'excuse', 'get', 'camping', 'trip', 'overheard', 'Marianne', 'Hairspray', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'head', 'ultra-Christian', 'contingent', 'student', 'body', 'who', 'rumor', 'mill', 'flying', 'Olive', 'adopt', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'attitude', 'dressing', 'part', 'ever', 'actually', 'doing', 'anything', 'actually', 'know', 'salacious', 'well', 'good', 'lie', 'Brandon', 'Cougar', 'Town', 'Dan', 'Byrd', 'school', 'only', 'gay', 'teen', 'who', 'plan', 'Olive', 'not', 'only', 'straight', 'now', 'seen', 'tramp', 'telling', 'people', 'been', 'could', 'give', 'image', 'makeover', 'too', 'help', 'consequences', 'are', 'much', 'father-reaching', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'anticipated.The', 'synopsis', ""n't"", 'get', 'anywhere', 'close', 'great', 'cast', 'movie', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'play', 'Olive', 'parents', 'Dill', 'Rosemary', 'less', 'are', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'time', ""'re"", 'screen', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'play', 'husband-and-wife', 'English', 'teacher', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'Olive', 'high', 'school', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'break', 'doing', 'below-average', 'horror', 'flicks', 'take', 'turn', 'Marianne', 'boyfriend', '22-year-old', 'who', 'repeating', 'senior', 'year', 'fourth', 'time', 'good', 'stuff', 'indeed', 'casting', 'perspective', 'how', 'script', 'hard', 'believe', 'Bert', 'Royal', 'first', 'feature', 'sharp', 'as', 'witty', 'John', 'Hughes', 'movies', 'Olive', 'idolizes', 'Quizno', 'guy', 'nice', 'product', 'placement', 'there', 'as', 'funny', 'ball-waxer', 'Gutterballs', 'saying', 'something', 'guy', 'who', 'two', 'lines', 'record', 'Rawson', 'Thurber', 'director', 'Mysteries', 'Pittsburgh', 'Sure', 'movie', 'problems', 'teen', 'comedy', 'John', 'Hughes-style', 'course', 'problems', 'are', 'number', 'times', 'when', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'very', 'interesting', 'directions', 'instead', 'chose', 'go', 'conventional', 'route', 'especially', 'where', 'Marianne', 'concerned', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'character', 'instead', 'one-dimensional', 'object', 'audience', 'ridicule', 'example', 'when', 'did', 'clause', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'contract', 'required', 'nude', 'scene', 'movie', 'run', 'out', 'Someone', 'got', 'get', 'renewed', 'smart', 'funny', 'should', 'give', 'look', '***']",N/A

The writers' poking fun at the fact that obvious twenty-somethings were portraying teens was hilarious.

Brill performances by supporting cast:  Amanda Bynes, Cam Gigandet, Thomas Hayden Church and Lisa Kudrow, especially.

1328453,A3V43IU15LA3HA,B0036TGSIK,snow47,"[3, 4]","Content Review - So, this film seems promising in premise. The Scarlett Letter loosely playing out in a modern high school setting, staring the terrific Emma Stone. But in my personal, subjective opinion, Easy A just does not add up to much in execution. Stone is one of the brightest young actors around, and she is endlessly charming, adorable and very sharp with her comedic timing. She is just a joy to watch. And the montage of her involuntarily spending all weekend singing along to ""Pocket Full of Sunshine"" is great.However, other than that, there is very little to this film. I get it conceptually, but nevertheless the plot overall comes across as contrived, and I do not really buy the ""moral of the story"" or the point that it is all trying to make. So, lacking that, we are left with the cast and the comedy. The former is fairly decent - I always enjoy Thomas Hayden Church - although I wish that Aly Michalka's part had better dialog, and Amanda Bynes feels even more out of place than her character is supposed to be. As far as the humor...there just is not that much of it. Some of what is there is of the gross and/or of course sexual variety (Scarlett Letter), FYI.For me, this feels like one of those films that is basically a likeable lead actor (Stone) and a few good jokes, with the screenplay, story and every other part of it merely serving as connective tissue in between. Ultimately: Meh.Packaging/Features Review - The DVD is fine, fairly bare bones.

1328457,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B0036TGSIK,Steve,"[2, 4]","Easy A was amusing and took an interesting premise and ran with it pretty far. Emma Stone does her job efficiently and with appropriate levels of teen sarcasm and uncertainty. On the other hand, Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson do as well as they can, but their characters are ridiculous cartoons. This is always a problem with teen movies, going back to Jim Backus in Rebel Without a Cause. They are the 21st century version of the girl's parents from Valley Girl - painfully hip and free and understanding. The mom and daughter talk towards the end was almost unbearable. Can't parents be written more believeably instead of like ridiculous cliches?Nearly all of the problems I had are related to my a) watching a light-hearted movie too closely and b) being 47 and not 17. For the record, my youngest two kids (14 & 15 as I type) thought it was great. First - the concept seemed odd to me. I kept wondering why a girl having sex in high school was seen as so horrifying. Am I to believe that in 2010 (when the movie was released) high school students having sex is seen as taboo and the fast track to character ruination? I graduated in 1981 and I can tell you for certain - that wasn't the case then. Have we actually gone backwards in our social view of teen sex? Someone please contact you local conservative tea bagger and let them know the good news. To that point then; if that's the case, then why do so many of her peers want to be viewed as non-virgins as well? Is it the gender double-standard or is it a problem with plot consistency?Spoiler alert: Secondly, when has a teacher having sex with students been treated with such a casual attitude? Not only does Emma Stone's character volunteer to assist the teacher in getting out of her mess, but she seems totally unfazed by it.Lastly, the heavy handed nature of the movie is problematic. Not only the Scarlet Letter part, but the Christian bashing. Trust me - I am no fan of religion whatsoever, but this was simply over-the-top. It's this kind of blatant attack on religion that get the right all pissy about Hollywood. If you're going to bash religion - great - contact Bill Maher and work on a plan. But in a teen movie that has a fairly light tone, the sarcastic mockery towards Christians was like shooting fish in a barrel. It might've felt good at the time but it comes across as a cheap shot.Like I said, I watched this far too closely and critically, but my review is more for the people who are from my generation.

If you have seen her in other movies, her character is the same in this one. Needless to say, she does it very well, so well in fact when she attempts to act sexy, it doesn't work, perhaps a sign that they had Lindsey Lohan in mind for the part. Emma doesn't want to go camping with her BFF's family so she lied about what she is doing that weekend and later lies that she had sex. (I loved the birthday card from the grandparents with $5.00 in it.) This falsehood is spread around school. Later a guy who is gay asks Emma to say she had sex with him so the kids won't pick on him. At a party, she pretends to have sex with him while nearly the entire student body is outside the door listening. Emma is shocked she now has the reputation as a ""skank."" This is a weak plot point that Ms. Stone makes real for us, as well as pretending to have sex for money with half the school. There is of course the Christian crowd who are more loud and obnoxious than in real life (I think), and Lisa Kudrow who did a lousy job as a guidance counselor, or maybe she wasn't good enough to save a plot with so many cartoon characters and plot implausibilities. The movie was laugh out loud funny and that was only because we did watch all those 80's movies.

1328467,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B0036TGSIK,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[1, 2]","Easy A is one of those movies that successfully portrait the high school universe, a universe that was magical for some of us, less so for some others. The movie has been receiving many positives reviews and rightfully so. What makes the movie work is without a doubt Emma Stone as Olive Penderghast. Stone was in the movies Superbad, House Bunny, Zombieland and a few others but I think Easy A is be the movie that will truly makes her a star. I always loved Emma and it's great to see her as the lead role in Easy A, she was just a perfect fit for the role and brings a lot to the table. Olive is one of those movie characters I wish I could be friends with. Her lovable, very open-minded and funny parents (Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson) are wonderful and supportive of their daughter. Her little brother doesn't get much screen time but he's funny and charming. Amanda Bynes who usually plays the good girl plays a not-so nice Christian girl, Olive's nemesis Marianne. The cast of characters are funny, likeable and some are very 80's-ish if there is such a thing.Olive Penderghast is a ""different"" high school student. Yet, everyone can relate to her and she is not so ""different"". When she lies to her best friend about losing her virginity she doesn't think this little lie is a big deal. The next day it seems the entire school knows what Olive did and treats her like a slut, which she isn't. Olive knows this has gotten out of hands and after hearing some of exaggerated stories about her, she decides that if people are going to treat her like a slut she should act like one, dress and look the part. She then does fake ""sexual favors"" for boys in exchange of gift cards; boys can say they had some fun with of Olive. The story goes further from there (and I didn't reveal much in case you're wondering) and it really is something that could happen to a high school girl, it's not far from reality and all of Easy A can be seen as realistic which really makes the audience connect. I must add that it was interesting to compare Olive to the character of Hester Prynne from Nathaniel Hawthorne's bookThe Scarlet Letter.I really liked he 80's tribute part of the movie, good call on that one. In fact, the older and more experienced viewer might get the feel that the Easy A was going for a 1980s John Hughes teenage type of movie and in some ways it is the case. At times it really remembers those classics Hughes movies and captures some of the feel, not completely but very close, as close as it will get today at least. It's certainly nice to have nostalgia in the movie and you better bet that you'll want to be watching some of those classic teenage 1980's comedies again. It's also very clear that Easy A has been highly influenced by those 80's comedies.It would be nice if Easy A would be considered a classic in the future, it deserves to be. I think it has a lot of emotional appeal and is just an overall excellent movie and I believe, one of the highlights of 2010. Easy A gets an A in my book and I strongly encourage you to watch this movie, it's very entertaining and worth your time. I've seen it twice as of writing this and I will no doubt watch it some more once it is released on DVD and Blue-Ray. 5/5.",5,"""Whatever happened to chivalry?

High School - or so the movie seems to suggest. Here we have a teenage girl that supposedly made out with someone - a rumor she started herself - and that gets out of hand. Then another person comes to her and wants her to be his ""beard,"" basically offering her money to say things happen. This sets things off and makes it like a train that will derail sooner or later.The problem is that the train itself expects to be fine but what about all the people around her? That and the humor are the thing that make this movie really worthy of watching.To start, Easy A would not normally be my laughtrack. I don't normally go for movies that are teenage, pretend teen, or anything else that might threaten me when I am getting everything together. I can say this, however, and it is simply that this movie was good because it had all types of humor. sometimes this was a direct cause of the Easy A we saw and sometimes it was messing with family. The family unit was a good one and I liked them. There was also alittle thing that happens with the guidance counselor and, honestly, that was rich.I loved it.Sometimes things come together and it is easy to overlook it. I'm glad I didn't and i think you might want to check it out. Know that the movie is about sex, of course, but does not contain things that are past joking.

1328469,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0036TGSIK,Turfseer,"[11, 49]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 1.5 out of 5'Easy A' was written by a first-time screenwriter, Bert V. Royal, and it shows! It's not his fault that most of the actors who play the high school students at 'Ojai North High School' (including the 22 year old star, Emma Stone) are too old for their parts. Director Will Gluck and his casting director must take the blame entirely for that. Royal, on the other hand, has proffered up a script featuring a fairly unsympathetic protagonist, pitted against an assortment of noxious antagonists, most of whom are pure stereotypes.Mr. Royal has really found the formula for making a quick buck in the film industry. Simply come up with a story about shallow teenagers who attend a high school. Royal reportedly concocted this smug tale in five days and it shows. His protagonist, Olive Penderghast, is an insecure teen who initially doesn't want to let her best friend Rhiannon know that she's a virgin, so she concocts a tall tale of a weekend liaison with a guy at a local community college. Marianne, daughter of a Christian minister and campus gossip, overhears Olive's fictitious claim and then spreads the word that Olive is a slut and soon enough most of the kids at school turn against her.At first, Olive appears sympathetic, as she is willing to help Brandon, an insecure gay kid who hopes to gain acceptance from his peers by pretending that he's straight. Olive helps him accomplish this by agreeing to simulate a sexual encounter with him, behind closed doors at a party thrown by the 'most popular' teen at the school. But then Olive decides to embrace her notoriety by accepting gift cards from nerds who ask her to vouch that she's had some kind of sexual contact with them.Since the student body is basically depicted as a bunch of nasty, back-stabbing gossips, Olive is unable to withdraw from the collective condemnation and perhaps seek support from a more sensitive, intellectual type of student. Even the cool English teacher, Mr. Griffith (Thomas Haden Church) fails to help her. In a completely awkward scene, a student calls Olive an ""abominable tramp"", likening her to Hester Prynne from Hawthorne's 'Scarlet Letter"". For some reason, however, Olive ends up in Principal Gibbon's (Malcolm McDowell) office after calling her an abominable (expletive deleted--starts with a ""t"", as those who saw the film will recall). I found it a bit unbelievable that a student would have to go to detention for merely calling another student a 't', especially after her rival started the whole thing; in addition, other students who have been actually physically assaulting one another, seem to receive an equal punishment . Actually it's never explained who actually sends Olive to the principal's office (why didn't sensitive Mr. Griffith try and defuse the situation?) and Malcolm McDowell, is also unbelievable as a surly martinet who cuts the kids no slack whatsoever.What's worse is that we're asked to root for Olive after she begins accepting the gift cards. By doing so, ultimately she bears the responsibility for compounding her negative reputation on campus and no one seems to point that out to her. Why does she act so surprised that one date almost takes things too far? Why also root for her when all the misguided males (sans good guy Todd) have no redeeming qualities? Also ask yourself whether you find it funny that these insecure males (en masse) would offer gifts to a woman who has such a dubious reputation. Is it really worth it to them, to have her vouch for them? In reality, having sexual contact with such an outcast as Olive, would probably lead to scorn from their peers--not approbation! So the whole idea that these nerds would shower gifts on Olive makes little sense!Olive is allowed to indulge in her negative, acting-out behavior since she's depicted as a total victim of a gossip-ridden society. Even if you believe that most people are like that, at least give your opponents their due: even the unprincipled have something of a likability factor! Not here! In addition to the insecure males, Christians also get short shrift here too. I have no objection to criticizing or making fun of those of the Christian faith but at least create some real life characters to shoot down. Here the Christians are narrow-minded bigots, buffoons, easily disposed of since they are completely one-dimensional. Even educators can't catch a break. Lisa Kudrow's Mrs. Griffith is perhaps the most unpleasant character in 'Easy A', having sex with one of the students and another one of those unlikeable individuals who have no guilt feelings about throwing Olive under the bus. Only Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson, who play Olive's over the top 'New Age' parents, manage to eke out a few laughs by taking permissive parenting to one big extreme.'Easy A' ends awkwardly as it begins. Somehow, Olive's bombastic musical production in the high school gym and a one last 'heart-felt' web cast manages to convince the surly high school population that she's not so bad after all, turning everything around. And she finds 'true love' to boot with that one 'sensitive' guy who respects her decision not to give away her virginity right away.Despite the poor script, the acting and direction in 'Easy A' is spot on and the film has some nifty cinematography. If you can stand all the implausibilities and lack of 'ideas', you might find all this somewhat entertaining. For more discerning eyes, the most predictable thing here is that the critics were once again taken in by all the tripe. Hopefully, a few of us will pray for their misguided souls!",1,"Easy ""A"" is really an Easy ""D"",",1313798400,"08 20, 2011",2011,5636,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Rating',

1328476,AP3B615GM191G,B0036TGSIK,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","A few years ago, the movie ""Mean Girls"" redefined ""high school experience"" movies.  With ""Easy A"", the ""bubblegum"" style of ""Mean Girls"" is replaced with a bit more of a sophisticated style.For a basic plot summary, ""Easy A"" focuses on high school student Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone), who inadvertently starts a rumor that she slept with a fellow student.  When the rumor spreads like wildfire and Olive realizes she cannot contain it, she decides to just go with it and see what happens.When it comes right down to it, ""Easy A"" strikes a nice balance between ridiculous & cute.  At some points you'll just be laughing at Olive's crazy antics, while at other times you might just actually care about her character (a rare feat in a primarily comedic effort).Also, it must be mentioned here that Emma Stone's performance as Olive carries this entire movie.  Stone can play sexy, sweet, and everything in between, and her range is on full display in this flick.  She is a joy to watch and redeems a plot that gets a bit thin after about the first hour.Overall, ""Easy A"" is a fun movie if you are interested in high school fare.  It tries to be witty, snarky, cute, & even a bit preachy all wrapped up in a single package and, while perhaps not accomplishing any one of those things totally, the combination is enough to warrant a viewing.",4,"The Thinking-Person's ""Mean Girls""",1331424000,"03 11, 2012",2012,1339,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'movie', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'redefined', 'high', 'school', 'experience', 'movies', 'Easy', 'A', 'bubblegum', 'style', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'replaced', 'bit', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'style.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Easy', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Olive', 'Penderghast', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'who', 'inadvertently', 'rumor', 'slept', 'fellow', 'student', 'When', 'rumor', 'spreads', 'wildfire', 'Olive', 'realizes', 'can', 'not', 'contain', 'just', 'go', 'see', 'what', 'happens.When', 'right', 'down', 'Easy', 'nice', 'balance', 'ridiculous', 'cute', 'points', ""'ll"", 'just', 'be', 'laughing', 'Olive', 'crazy', 'antics', 'other', 'times', 'might', 'just', 'actually', 'care', 'character', 'rare', 'feat', 'primarily', 'comedic', 'effort', '.Also', 'must', 'be', 'mentioned', 'here', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'performance', 'Olive', 'entire', 'movie', 'Stone', 'can', 'play', 'sexy', 'sweet', 'everything', 'range', 'full', 'display', 'flick', 'joy', 'watch', 'redeems', 'plot', 'bit', 'thin', 'first', 'hour.Overall', 'Easy', 'fun', 'movie', 'are', 'interested', 'high', 'school', 'fare', 'be', 'witty', 'snarky', 'cute', 'even', 'bit', 'preachy', 'wrapped', 'up', 'single', 'package', 'perhaps', 'not', 'accomplishing', 'one', 'things', 'totally', 'combination', 'enough', 'warrant', 'viewing']",N/A
