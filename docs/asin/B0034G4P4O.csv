But I wanted to tell you what I thought about the movie as someone who grew up sometimes watching the cartoon when it was popular on HBO in the 90's.First off...if you have any doubts if this movie will do the cartoon any justice or not it does. In spades. I recall watching the cartoons of the past but eventually getting bored with them. But this movie was pretty exciting from the get go. It had me glued and waiting for them to solve the mystery of the ""scrolls"" located inside of the boats.It's been a couple of months since I watched this movie on demand on my television so I don't really know the story anymore.

An animated 3D spectacle, Tintin is based on a series of classic Belgian comics bearing the same title, and features a young journalist and his faithful dog sidekick Snowy as they travel the globe in search of a sunken treasure from the 17th Century. Featuring an all-star voice cast that includes Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost, Tintin can be compared to an earlier Spielberg franchise starring a certain treasure-hunting Archaeology professor by the name of ""Indiana,"" which could be good or bad, depending on how you look at it.

1323501,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B0034G4P4O,Andres C. Salama,"[8, 30]","A huge disappointment by two genuinely great directors specialized in popular entertainment, like Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson. The secret of The Unicorn was the first Tintin book I read (my parents give it to me as a present when I was 9 years old, more than thirty years ago). It is also one of my favorite Tintin books. This might be why I felt so disappointed by this. Absent from the movie is all the subtlety in the book. What is present here is a very heavy handed, video-game like approach.In theory, this could have been a match made in heaven, as previous works by Spielberg especially (like the Indiana Jones franchise) have a strong resemblance to Tintin, in terms of plot and in terms of the epoch (the thirties and the forties were the epoch were both Tintin and Indiana have their best outings). In practice, the film doesn't work. Let's try to analyze why.Let's first concede that Tintin is difficult to bring into the screen (previous adaptations, both animated and live-action, have failed). I think one of the reasons is that Tintin lives in a very stylized world, and this becomes quite obvious when one transplants Tintin from a drawing in a paper to a photographic medium (even in the form of computer animation).The charming plot of the book (Tintin finds by accident a manuscript hidden inside a model ship called the Unicorn that might be a clue to a hidden treasure, and soon sees himself chased by other people interested in that treasure), has some minor changes, but those changes are generally for the worst. For instance, the slimy Bird brothers in the book were better villains than Ivan Sakharine in the film, who was not one of the bad guys in the original book. Mixed up with the plot of the Unicorn (and in a not very convincing manner), appear elements of other Tintin books, especially The Crab with the Golden Claws, another favorite of mine.Lastly, the animation is not completely convincing: the problem of the unrealistic eyes (the so called uncanny valley, which many have pointed already in The Polar Express, and which evidently hasn't been solved) makes for a Tintin that is slightly creepy. By the way, the photography is some scenes is too dark and murky, when the Tintin books are famous for the use of bright colors and little contrast (the famous clear line style).",2,Disappointing,1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,2322,"['huge', 'disappointment', 'two', 'genuinely', 'great', 'directors', 'specialized', 'popular', 'entertainment', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'secret', 'Unicorn', 'was', 'first', 'Tintin', 'book', 'read', 'parents', 'give', 'present', 'when', 'was', '9', 'years', 'old', 'more', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'also', 'one', 'favorite', 'Tintin', 'books', 'might', 'be', 'why', 'felt', 'so', 'disappointed', 'Absent', 'movie', 'subtlety', 'book', 'What', 'present', 'here', 'very', 'heavy', 'handed', 'video-game', 'approach.In', 'theory', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'match', 'made', 'heaven', 'previous', 'works', 'Spielberg', 'especially', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'franchise', 'have', 'strong', 'resemblance', 'Tintin', 'terms', 'plot', 'terms', 'epoch', 'thirties', 'forties', 'were', 'epoch', 'were', 'Tintin', 'Indiana', 'have', 'best', 'outings', 'practice', 'film', ""n't"", 'work', 'Let', 'try', 'analyze', 'why.Let', 'first', 'concede', 'Tintin', 'difficult', 'bring', 'screen', 'previous', 'adaptations', 'animated', 'live-action', 'have', 'failed', 'think', 'one', 'reasons', 'Tintin', 'very', 'stylized', 'world', 'quite', 'obvious', 'when', 'one', 'transplants', 'Tintin', 'drawing', 'paper', 'photographic', 'medium', 'even', 'form', 'computer', 'animation', 'charming', 'plot', 'book', 'Tintin', 'accident', 'manuscript', 'hidden', 'model', 'ship', 'called', 'Unicorn', 'might', 'be', 'clue', 'hidden', 'treasure', 'soon', 'sees', 'chased', 'other', 'people', 'interested', 'treasure', 'minor', 'changes', 'changes', 'are', 'generally', 'worst', 'instance', 'slimy', 'Bird', 'brothers', 'book', 'were', 'better', 'villains', 'Ivan', 'Sakharine', 'film', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'bad', 'guys', 'original', 'book', 'Mixed', 'plot', 'Unicorn', 'not', 'very', 'convincing', 'manner', 'appear', 'elements', 'other', 'Tintin', 'books', 'especially', 'Crab', 'Golden', 'Claws', 'favorite', 'mine.Lastly', 'animation', 'not', 'completely', 'convincing', 'problem', 'unrealistic', 'eyes', 'so', 'called', 'uncanny', 'valley', 'many', 'have', 'pointed', 'already', 'Polar', 'Express', 'evidently', ""n't"", 'been', 'solved', 'Tintin', 'slightly', 'creepy', 'way', 'photography', 'scenes', 'too', 'dark', 'murky', 'when', 'Tintin', 'books', 'are', 'famous', 'use', 'bright', 'colors', 'little', 'contrast', 'famous', 'clear', 'line', 'style']",N/A

Tin Tin is a fun film and the action is here in spades, but somewhere between one action scene and the next there is a seeming emptiness that needed some sort of filling.  The basic premise is one of sheer adventure, and as such this film really works.  The brisk pacing keeps everyone on the edge of their seat and the visual effects are beautifully composed to keep us entertained.  I'm a little shocked they decided to do a stop-motion film when there is nothing here that they couldn't have shot live-action, and it may have even been more exciting in that context.  Still, the main issue with Tin Tin is that the film never breathes.

1323508,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B0034G4P4O,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[1, 1]","Tintin, a young Belgian journalist, is drawn into a web of intrigue and deception when he buys a model of a ship called the Unicorn. At least two groups take an interest in the model and Tintin finds himself shot at and his flat burgled. Sensing a possible story, Tintin pursues the mystery of the Unicorn across multiple countries and continents to its surprising and unexpected conclusion.The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn is a motion-captured animated movie directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by Peter Jackson. An enormous amount of creative firepower has been brought to bear on bringing Belgian cartoonist Herg&eacute;'s characters to life. It was a bit of a gamble by Spielberg and Jackson, as the Tintin albums (graphic novels) are immensely successful worldwide but are relatively little-known in the United States. Making use of this fact, the movie was released in Europe several weeks prior to its American release, building up a good word-of-mouth that boosted the film's success in the States (and leading to a sequel being put into development).I was a major Tintin fan as a child, collecting quite a few of the albums and watching the animated TV series. I was interested to see what Spielberg and Jackson could produce, but was also a little worried. Early trailers seemed to show an artistic style reminiscent of the 'uncanny valley'-stricken Polar Express (where the almost-human-looking characters are off-puttingly fake). Fortunately, the finished film is mostly a success, avoiding most of the pitfalls of CGI movies that try to stick too closely to realism. The animation is jaw-dropping, whether it's depicting an action-packed, one-shot motorcycle chase through a Middle-Eastern city, a battle between duelling shipyard cranes or a running gunfight on a ship at night. For the most part the characters are given animation and life, with a slightly stylised art style used that falls between realism and outright cartoons. The 'uncanny valley' issue remains in small doses, and is a particular problem with Tintin himself. Like his comic counterpart, the film's Tintin is a little on the bland side with few defining characteristics aside from his stoic heroism and determination. Luckily, his more colourful and interesting companion characters (most notably Captain Haddock, whom, as in the albums, steals most of the scenes he's in) more than make up for this lack.As well as the successful animation, the movie is backed up by a strong, pacy script. Co-written by current Doctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat and British comedy directors Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim) and Joe Cornish (Attack the Block), the script draws on storylines from three of the albums: The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure (probably among the best-known and apparently the biggest-selling of the albums). The writers pack a huge amount of incident into the film's 110 minutes, but ably move between moments of characterisation, comedy and action without making the film feel too busy or short. Spielberg's direction is also impressive, particularly the aforementioned tracking shot depicting a motorcycle chase through a bustling city, which is much more successful than Spielberg's previous attempts to do long one-shots. A sequence in which Haddock recalls the adventures of his ancestor and mixes present-day shots of the desert and flashes back to a raging sea battle is also highly engaging.Rounding off the film's success is the voice acting. Andy Serkis (best-known as Gollum from Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies) is great as Captain Haddock, imbuing him with comedy and pathos as needed. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as Thompson and Thomson are also amusing, whilst Daniel Craig is superbly menacing as the film's primary villain, Ivan Sakharine. Jamie Bell does a good job with Tintin, but is not given a huge amount to work with.Overall, The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn (****) is a highly successful adaptation of Herg&eacute;'s characters and stories. The film is funny, dramatic, exciting and fast-paced, easily Spielberg's best work in a decade and hugely outstripping the terrible Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull as a rollicking adventure movie. Where problems emerge are a few (mercifully short) sequences where uncanny valley-itis sets in and the issues of Tintin not being a terribly engaging protagonist. But with its excellent voice acting, awesome visuals and well-paced script, the movie overcomes these problems with ease. The film is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray). I highly recommend the Blu-Ray version for its superior visual quality. This is one film which really deserves to be seen in as high quality as possible.",4,"An excellent film, Spielberg's best in years",1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,4814,"['Tintin', 'young', 'Belgian',

It looked like a good movie when I first saw the preview and when I knew Steven Spielberg directed it, I expected a good film.Man was I blown away by this movie!The plot wastes no time getting into the action. Within a couple minutes we learned of the Unicorn: an old pirate ship with quite a history. TinTin purchases a model of the ship to which he immediately is approached by one man about it and then another. This ship certainly has a story behind it! The story goes 100 mph from there. From that point, there's not a moment to take a breath until the credits.The two main characters, TinTin and Captain Haddock, are great. TinTin's intent on a story and doesn't let fear stand in his wait of getting it. Haddock is a humorous drunk. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of interaction between the two.The animation in this movie is fantastic. Coupled with some awesome action scenes (in particular the flashback to the battle on the Unicorn and the chase through town near the end) the movie is nothing but fun. Spielberg has done a fantastic job of using animation to his advantage to get impossible angles, camera pans, and close-ups on the action.I highly recommend you see this movie.

Why is that important? Because I had the upmost faith it would be a brilliant film and faithful to Herge's creation. Thank god, I wasn't let down! The brilliance of the film starts from the very cool opening titles with John Williams' amazing, nostalgic score, and from there it doesn't let up. Performances of all the cast was outstanding, with special shout out to Serkis as the bumbling, drunk Captain Haddock. The CGI is immensely detailed, with the character expression the best I have seen in a film. This adaptation will go down as a classic!Best bit?There's plenty to choose! However, the opera scene is particularly great for its tension and drama.Did you know?The film is based on three of Herge' books: The Crab with the Golden Claws(1941), The Secret of the Unicorn (1943), and Red Rackham's Treasure (1944)",5,An amazing and very faithful adaptation,1330646400,"03 2, 2012",2012,1173,"['What', 'Tin', 'Tin', 'out', 'adventure', 'find', 'golden', 'unicorn', 'treasure', 'evil', 'Red', 'Rackham', 'hands', 'it.Is', 'good', 'Having', 'watched', 'cartoons', 'read', 'comics', 'can', 'imagine', 'delight', 'relief', 'fan', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'announced', 'collaboration', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Why', 'important', 'had', 'upmost', 'faith', 'would', 'be', 'brilliant', 'film', 'faithful', 'Herge', 'creation', 'Thank', 'god', 'was', ""n't"", 'let', 'down', 'brilliance', 'film', 'very', 'cool', 'opening', 'titles', 'John', 'Williams', 'amazing', 'nostalgic', 'score', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'Performances', 'cast', 'was', 'outstanding', 'special', 'shout', 'Serkis', 'bumbling', 'drunk', 'Captain', 'Haddock', 'CGI', 'immensely', 'detailed', 'character', 'expression', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'adaptation', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'classic', 'Best', 'bit', 'plenty', 'choose', 'However', 'opera', 'scene', 'particularly', 'great', 'tension', 'drama.Did', 'know', 'film', 'based', 'three', 'Herge', 'books', 'Crab', 'Golden', 'Claws', '1941', 'Secret', 'Unicorn', '1943', 'Red', 'Rackham', 'Treasure', '1944']",N/A

1323543,AN9J46667D80O,B0034G4P4O,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[1, 2]","So what do you get when you take the director of The Lord of the Rings movies, the director of the Indiana Jones movies, and the writer/producer for the current series of Doctor Who and give them $135 million to play around with? Turns out you get the best action film I've seen in ages and what will likely be the Best Animated Film winner at the next Oscar ceremony.The Adventures of Tintin is based on a Belgian comic book that, despite having three years of French in high school, I have no memory of. I'm sure I read it at some point, but I was always more of an Asterix kind of guy. So while I cannot comment on the film compared with the comics, I can comment on the film itself and I can say that it was everything I'd hoped for.The story focuses on Tintin (Jamie Bell), a...boy, I suppose? It's hard to tell his age for sure, but I get the impression he's supposed to be around sixteen or seventeen? However he lives on his own and has a job as a successful reporter, so perhaps he's just an adult. Anyhow, he buys a model ship, only to find out that certain other people, including a rather sinister-looking man (Daniel Craig), want to get their hands on it. Soon the boat is stolen, and Tintin, along with his faithful dog, Snowy, are kidnapped, and trapped aboard a ship.With the help of the ship's captain (Andy Sirkis), he manages to escape, and winds up in chases involving, at various points, the following vehicles: a cargo ship, a life boat, a seaplane, a motorcycle (that becomes a unicycle), and a hotel (don't ask). This culminates in a sword-fight that uses cranes as swords. It is, to put it mildly, somewhat action-packed. I really can't say enough about the action sequences in this movie, which very much put me in mind of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, only with a better budget.But like the best Speilberg action movies, it doesn't lose track of the story, which is engaging and enjoyable. All the characters serve a purpose and are fun to watch on screen. Captain Haddock, in particular, was wonderful fun. Andy Serkis continues to prove that he really did get the royal screw-job when he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his performance as Golum. Jamie Bell is also great as Tintin, who is played somewhat like a younger version of the Doctor, which is no surprise given Moffat's involvement.The film did seem to drag a bit toward the end, and the obvious set-up for a sequel was a bit annoying. On the plus side, regardless of how the film performs here in the USA, a sequel is likely, since it's already pulled in nearly $240 million overseas.One final word: if you want to see the film in the theatre, don't knock yourself out to see it in 3D. The 3D effect is ok, and doesn't distract or anything, but I don't know that it really adds anything to the movie. It was well done and all, but like with any 3D, it does dim the screen considerably, and I'm sure the film would work just as well in 2D.",4,Jackson+Speilberg+Moffat = Glory,1324425600,"12 21, 2011",2011,2935,"['So', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'when', 'take', 'director', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'movies', 'director', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'movies', 'writer/producer', 'current', 'series', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'give', '135', 'million', 'play', 'around', 'out', 'get', 'best', 'action', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'ages', 'what', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Film', 'winner', 'next', 'Oscar', 'ceremony.The', 'Adventures', 'Tintin', 'based', 'Belgian', 'comic', 'book', 'having', 'three', 'years', 'French', 'high', 'school', 'have', 'memory', ""'m"", 'sure', 'read', 'point', 'was', 'always', 'more', 'Asterix', 'kind', 'guy', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'film', 'compared', 'comics', 'can', 'comment', 'film', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'everything', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'for.The', 'story', 'focuses', 'Tintin', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'boy', 'suppose', 'hard', 'tell', 'age', 'sure', 'get', 'impression', 'supposed', 'be', 'around', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'However', 'own', 'job', 'successful', 'reporter', 'so', 'perhaps', 'just', 'adult', 'Anyhow', 'model', 'ship', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'certain', 'other', 'people', 'including', 'rather', 'sinister-looking', 'man', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'want', 'get', 'hands', 'Soon', 'boat', 'stolen', 'Tintin', 'faithful', 'dog', 'Snowy', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'trapped', 'ship.With', 'help', 'ship', 'captain', 'Andy', 'Sirkis', 'escape', 'up', 'chases', 'involving', 'various', 'points', 'following', 'vehicles', 'cargo', 'ship', 'life', 'boat', 'seaplane', 'motorcycle', 'unicycle', 'hotel', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'sword-fight', 'cranes', 'swords', 'put', 'mildly', 'somewhat', 'action-packed', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'action', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'put', 'mind', 'Young', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Chronicles', 'only', 'better', 'budget.But', 'best', 'Speilberg', 'action', 'movies', ""n't"", 'lose', 'track', 'story', 'engaging', 'enjoyable', 'characters', 'serve', 'purpose', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'screen', 'Captain', 'Haddock', 'particular', 'was', 'wonderful', 'fun', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'prove', 'really', 'did', 'get', 'royal', 'screw-job', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'Golum', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'also', 'great', 'Tintin', 'who', 'played', 'somewhat', 'younger', 'version', 'Doctor', 'surprise', 'given', 'Moffat', 'involvement.The', 'film', 'did', 'seem', 'drag', 'bit', 'end', 'obvious', 'set-up', 'sequel', 'was', 'bit', 'annoying', 'plus', 'side', 'regardless', 'how', 'film', 'performs', 'here', 'USA', 'sequel', 'likely', 'already', 'pulled', 'nearly', '240', 'million', 'overseas.One', 'final', 'word', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'theatre', 'do', ""n't"", 'knock', 'out', 'see', '3D', '3D', 'effect', 'ok', ""n't"", 'distract', 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'really', 'anything', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'done', '3D', 'dim', 'screen', 'considerably', ""'m"", 'sure', 'film', 'would', 'work', 'just', 'as', 'well', '2D']",N/A

Love them all!  So many times I have been disappointed when Hollywood takes something I love, adapts it to the big screen, and completely ruins it so that any resemblance between the movie and the original is pure coincidence.  With Spielberg and Jackson at the helm, I expected a high quality production, but what about the actual story?This movie takes elements from three Tintin books - ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"", ""The Secret of the Unicorn"", and ""Red Rackham's Treasure"".  Most of ""The Crab..."" that's in the movie is about how Tintin and Captain Haddock met.  In ""Unicorn"", the flea market scenes actually took place AFTER Tintin and Haddock met, as Tintin had bought the model ship as a gift for his friend.  But in the movie, he bought the ship before he met Haddock.But unless you are that much of a stickler for details, this shouldn't matter.  With the exception of these few details, the story was very true to the books and the Nelvana animated series.  What was even better was how the characters were written; I am sure Herge would have approved, as they were just as he intended them to be.  All the personality quirks of Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, Thomson & Thompson, etc - all there as we remember them.  I thought they did a great job with the casting, as well.I was afraid they'd ruin this movie by doing something dumb like bringing on a love interest for Tintin (something that never happened in the books, but Hollywood often can't leave stuff alone).  This is an adventure story, not a romance, and it was wise of Spielberg/Jackson to treat it as such.The ending of the movie left me begging for a sequel.

1323555,A1RD1LL5E5JZOT,B0034G4P4O,"Crookedmouth "":-/""","[236, 258]","A film by Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg, story by Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish and starring Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig and Pegg & Frost. Sounds good, doesn't it? But 'ware! The subject is one of the most cherished icons of 20th century child's story-telling, held dear by pretty much anyone of a ""certain age"" and transferred from a distinctive style to modern CGI animation. The potential to fail is strong in this one...Briefly, the story is a mash-up of three well known episodes in the Tintin canon, The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn, and Red Rackham's Treasure. Tintin (Bell) meets Captain Haddock (Serkis) and embark on an action packed search for the Captain's ancestor's treasure trove. They are joined by two of the more fondly remembered of Tintin's associates, Thompson and Thomson played by Pegg and Frost, (or is it Frost and Pegg?) and stalked by arch criminal Ivan Sakharine (Craig).The film is produced using performance capture animation and it bridges the gap between a live action film and the straight ""cartoon"" of the Bernasconi animated series. Obviously Tintin purists will have their objections as the film does take *some* liberties with the ""look"", but to the ordinary audience member, the end product is both impressive and reverential to Herge. If there are any objections to the CGI animation (and there are a few minor ones) I think it's important to remember that the art and technology of CGI is still developing and it would be churlish to criticise too strongly. One criticism I have heard is that the emotional expression of the characters suffers in the CGI process. I'll have none of that! The characters' faces are expressive and readable and it is quite easy eventually to forget that they *are* CGI and my wife came out of the cinema remarking that the make-up was very good and she didn't recognise Andy Serkis at all!Most importantly, the animation really does keep the faith with Herge's vision (Herge even appears in a small cameo in the opening sequence) in almost every way. The characters are depicted as 3D versions of his original ligne claire artwork (without the lignes) and it's a big relief that the story is set in the 1940's Tintin universe, ""somewhere in Europe"", plus-fours, bowler hats, rusty tramp-steamers, schmeisser machine guns and sea-planes galore. The film really retains the film noir ""feel"" of the original and that will be important to Tintin's fans. The ""scenery"" is, like Herge's comics, sumptuously populated and I was crying out for a remote control to pause and rewind the film so that I could revisit some of the little details that I half-missed - the covers of magazines carelessly tossed onto desktops, the contents of the desk's partly opened drawers, little cameo sequences that take place at the edge of the screen while the main action is front and centre, the array of faces in The Milanese Nightingale's audience and so-on. The film has *huge* rewatch potential and I will be pre-ordering the DVD as soon as it becomes available for this reason alone!The acting is brilliant and all the performers really bring their characters to life. Bell does a fine job and Serkis and Pegg and Frost convey their slapstick antics extremely well. It's good that the actors' performances don't overwhelm the characters' already well-developed personalities. While I've heard some criticism that Serkis overcooks his Haddock, I disagree - the Captain is a larger-than-life personality and Serkis does a fine job with this wonderful character. I am aching, however, to meet Professor Calculus in a sequel (please let it be Destination Moon)!Ol' Steve has been around a while, now and knows a thing or too about the action/adventure genre and he really lets rip with this one. Indiana Jones for kids? I'll say. The action is breath-taking and at nearly two hours in length it's a rollercoaster ride. The motorcycle chase scene, filmed in a single continuous take is the centrepiece of the film. Spielberg bundles you into the sidecar and takes you on a break-neck race, bouncing you off the walls, leaping chasms and leaving you, several minutes later, sitting in a small cloud of dust with steam coming off the seat of your pants and little cork-screws of sweat radiating off your head. The ""Long Take"" scene is becoming a bit of a cliche in modern cinematography and, I think, looks a little ostentatious in live action film, but in animation it works rather well and left me exhausted and deeply satisfied. And it doesn't let up - in true Spielberg/Indy style, the film barely slows down for a minute. There's plenty of good, Herge slapstick, not too overdone and obeying the hallowed traditions of visual comedy, and genuine laugh out loud moments aplenty.In the final analysis, The Adventures of Tintin is a top notch family film. It will, like any film of this sort, have its detractors; but what Jackson and Spielberg have achieved is a joyful, exuberant whoop of a film that will appeal to kids of all ages (i.e. anywhere between about 5 and 85) and will offend none but the hardest of Tintin die-hards.Did we enjoy it?

1323557,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0034G4P4O,C. Sawin,"[2, 2]","The Adventures of Tintin was a film I wasn't sure what to think of. Another motion capture CG animated film? Haven't we gotten enough of those from Robert Zemeckis? Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull really soured my opinion of an already faulty foundation known as Steven Spielberg's more recently directed films. However there was an upside: both the outstanding Edgar Wright and writer/director of Attack the Block Joe Cornish contributed to the writing of the film. The cast was also incredible and the film had a reputation amongst critics who had already seen it as being this nonstop action adventure. Tintin sounded like money going into it; BIG money. The final product turns out to be rather good, but isn't quite as spectacular as the hype lets on.You're pretty much thrown into this mystery right from the start. This isn't an origin story. It's a continuation of a character most people either are already familiar with and/or immensely love. Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) buys a model ship at an outdoor market known as The Unicorn, but things become strange very quickly. Two men try to obtain the ship from him right after he purchases it: the first one warning him to get rid of it as soon as he can and the other, a man named Ivanovich Sakharine (voiced by Daniel Craig) offering him any price he'd like. Politely declining, Tintin takes the ship home and eventually discovers that something is hidden inside the ship. As a journalist always hungry for a story, Tintin embarks on an incredible adventure accompanied by his dog Snowy and a sea captain named Captain Haddock (voiced by Andy Serkis).The opening credits are amazing. It's traditional 2D animation, so it stands out from the rest of the film. There's this mini mystery solved during the duration of the opening credits. The pace is perfect and it's easily one of the best film openings of the year. You'll probably also notice the incredible score by John Williams right out the gate. It captures the atmosphere of crime and noir films perfectly and makes full use of a wide range of orchestral instruments. It's just an extraordinary score all around.Peter Jackson once described the film's look as ""photorealistic; the fibers of their clothing, the pores of their skin and each individual hair. They look exactly like real people - but real Herge people!"" This is a really exceptional quote to fall back on when trying to describe how the film looks. Textures, hair, and the way character's mouths move are all very realistic. Despite sharing motion capture qualities with recent Robert Zemeckis films such as A Christmas Carol, Beowulf, and The Polar Express, Tintin looks better. It could be due to the characters looking more like the actual characters and not the actors who portray them, but Tintin pays ridiculous attention to detail which is probably just as much a blessing as it is a curse.There are two action scenes in the film that are worth the price of admission alone; Captain Haddock's pirate flashback and the motorcycle chase scene. The pirate ship battle makes it seem like the Pirates of the Caribbean films failed miserably at anything remotely resembling action. Tintin has this fantastic use of perspective in that it's dynamic, but it doesn't get too experimental or crazy. It's like you're always in the right place at the right time. You can clearly make out what's going on at all times, which is something Michael Bay isn't able to claim the majority of the time. The motorcycle chase is my favorite of the two since it's nonstop. The pirate scene cuts back and forth between what Haddock is remembering and what's transpiring in the real world. The motorcycle chase is just in your face the entire time, lasts around six minutes, and puts you on the edge of your seat.Tintin does have its shortcomings though. It does feature two of the year's best action scenes, but it also drags quite a bit in the middle. You get a little bored at times watching Tintin and Haddock be stranded out at sea, stumble through the desert, and Haddock's incessant rambling of never having enough booze. It results in the film feeling longer than it is. There was also a big deal about seeing this on screen. ""It MUST be seen in 3D,"" is what we were told. As you can imagine, the 3D isn't really mandatory for enjoying the film. Aside from one scene, I don't recall a huge use of it anyway. A lot of the action was also extremely unrealistic, as well. I know, it's Hollywood, it's Steven Spielberg, you're supposed to already have this suspension of disbelief anyway. If I get to the point where I notice that this couldn't happen in reality though, then I feel like the movie hasn't effectively done its job; not completely anyway. That feeling was almost overbearing at times with Tintin.The Adventures of Tintin does seem to fall a bit short of the painting critics have painted for it, but is still well worth the price of admission. This year has also been an amazing year for movies featuring dogs: The Artist had Jack, Beginners had Arthur, and Tintin has Snowy. Snowy is easily the most entertaining of the three, but he's also the most animated and the most fictional. Tintin may be a bit slow at times, but visually it's freaking spectacular and the score is an easy contender for one of the best of the year. As far as animated films go, it's films like The Adventures of Tintin that movie lovers live for.",4,Pretty freakin' incredible,1324425600,"12 21, 2011",2011,5424,"['Adventures', 'Tintin', 'was',

1323559,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0034G4P4O,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[77, 89]","The Adventures of Tintin is an enjoyable well done adaptation of the books by Herge. For somebody that knows nothing about Tintin, this is an Indiana Jones-esque story that is fun and action packed. For the Tintin aficionado, this is an amalgamation of three books with some parts that are needlessly extended.March 13, 2012 Update: Blu-Ray + DVD + Digital Copy arrived today. The Digital copy is two different things, a real live downloadable copy through iTunes and the horrible streaming Ultraviolet copy. The ""deluxe"" Blu-Ray version includes an access code for both types of on computer viewing. The Blu-Ray disc is very nice. I saw the original movie in 3D at the theater. I don't miss the 3D effect, and frankly the sound was better at home on my home theater system. This is a disc well worth buying.The opening credits are almost worth the price of admission. The roughly 3 minutes of credits go through almost all the stories. The graphics are very similar to the books.Tintin, a journalist, buys a model ship at a flea market. It turns out a lot of other people want that ship. There is a bit of mystery, a bit of action, and treasure hunt in the story. The movie is based mostly on the Unicorn series (The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure) and The Crab with the Golden Claws. I love the homage to Herge at the beginning of the film, he is the artist doing Tintin's portrait at the flea market.My criticism of the film is the embellishment of a number of scenes. I think the original story left the right kind of gaps in the story to keep me thinking. The film tended to fill in those gaps and lead me too much down the primrose path; I didn't have to think very much with this film. The real pleasure of Tintin is that a person has to think about these stories. The other piece I didn't care for was bringing in Castefiore the opera singer. She really doesn't belong in this story, but Spielberg and Jackson seem to have felt she was a plausible addition.This was filmed in motion capture animation. The film looked really good. That technique has a tendency to look almost too realistic and creepy, not in this film. There was just enough cartoon character to the film, that I never thought this was trying to imitate real life. I saw this in 3D, and can't say it was necessary - I think the film will work just fine in 2D.I really liked the cast. The voices were excellent choices; Jamie Bell is simply fantastic as Tintin. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (Shaun of the Dead, andHot Fuzz (Widescreen Edition)) are so perfect as Thompson and Thompson.I am a Tintin fan. We have the full DVD set of all the cartoons (these were only available in Canada for a long time and ran on Nickelodeon back in 1991). We also own many of the books. I even have some original antique paper comic books from the early days. I am not a true aficionado of the series, but have loved the original series in French and English.The film is rated PG. Compared to television cartoons, just about any age child could watch this. There's animated violence. The story is a little bit complex, but most children will catch on easily.Almost two years ago I heard that The Adventures of Tintin was in development. I hoped that it would eventually see the light of day in a theater. I am so happy this film was made. It is a wonderful film of my favorite comic book series. This is by far the best filming that has ever been done. The DVD cartoons are very literal translations of the books, with exactly the same graphics and almost the same dialog. The two French live action movies are both pretty campy and not exactly the best films in the world. They stick to the book story lines pretty literally. They are only available in French with no subtitles at all (Tintin: Le Mystere de la Toison D'or / Les Oranges Bleues (French Version)).The Adventures of Tintin is a wonderful film. I enjoyed this film very much.By the way, Marlinspike is a real chateau in France, it is Chteau de Cheverny. The chateau is larger than in the cartoon or books - but it is the model Herge used to draw Marlinspike Hall. The grounds look exactly like the cartoon (it's pretty darn amazing to walk up to this Chateau and see exactly what Herge used as his model).The original cartoons are available on DVD:The DVD Box set:The Adventures of Tintin, Vols. 1-5The Adventures of Tintin, Vols. 6-10The 2011 film:The Adventures of TintinThe new DVD releases:The Adventures Of Tintin: Season OneThe Adventures Of Tintin: Season TwoThe Unicorn 2 part cartoon is also available on Amazon Instant Video:The Secret Of The Unicorn, Part 1The Secret Of The Unicorn, Part 2Red Rackham's Treasure and The Crab With The Golden Claws are available on Amazon Instant Video.

Will European audiences accept Hollywood's interpretation of a beloved character, and will US audiences line up for it?Like so many Americans, I'm out of the loop on Tintin.  I was aware of the character's popularity in the soccer-loving part of the world and could have picked him out of a lineup, but that was about it.  Therefore, although I was hugely entertained by this film, I can't comment on its fidelity to the source material.  (However, the fact that Herge himself reportedly felt Spielberg was the only one who could do justice to his character bodes well on that count.)  The over-the-top exploits that sank ""Crystal Skull"" for so many people (swinging through the treetops with the monkeys, `nuff said) go down much easier in CGI, which straddles the line between the visceral impact of live action and the suspension of the laws of physics allowed by animation quite successfully here.  Tintin is a bit of a cypher--he looks like a teenager but he has his own apartment, everyone treats him like an adult, and his collection of news clippings is evidence of an eventful career.  The most interesting character is really the drunken Captain Haddock, whose arc takes him from a pathetic souse to something much greater.  I'll dock it one star because the action goes on perhaps just a hair too long, which makes the perfectly good denouement suffer by comparison.

1323566,ALZUXIRR1BVV0,B0034G4P4O,Deej,"[7, 10]","Basically this is an action-adventure, animation film depiction of Herge's (belgian cartoonist) brilliant tintin comics which he did between the 30's and the 70's. It takes story lines from a number of different adventures and combines them to try and create relatively new elements to the main story of 'The Secret of the Unicorn'. Our young Journalist Tintin gets involved in an adventure that sees the bad guys trying to get hold of 2 different model tall ships as they contain parchments that reveal the secret. This results in Tintin being kidnapped, meeting his buddy-in-adventure, Captain Haddock, being stranded at sea, then in the desert and ending up in Morocco. There's also flash back sequences to stories of pirates and buccaneers that are integral to the plot. There's a lot of action on the way and some witty dialogue too but the strongest element lies in it's general mystery plot and globe trotting fun.Tintin the comics were one of the first pieces of writing I ever loved. The adventures were so exotic and he would find himself in countless countries and environments (including the moon), fighting drug dealers and gangsters, making friends with latin revolutionaries and arab sheiks. They were stories with great mystery, suspense and sometimes the super natural thrown in. Now, I know it's difficult to translate the detail of books to film but it can be done. This film, like most, once again does not deliver this well. I mean some of the new ideas and the idea of combining different books into this one story actually works ok but what let's it down is too many 'unrealistic elements' and cheesy moments. I know this is an animation movie but Tintin is also supposed to be a 'more realistic character and subsequently so should the movie. For example, how does he go through a chase sequence where his motorbike explodes, leaving him with the front wheel and handle bars (whilst he's in mid air) which he uses to zip line (the line also appearing conveniently in front of him)? And in terms of cheese, for example, Haddock, having drunk the alcohol to use as emergency fuel, burps into the fuel tank once he's crawled outside the plane and sits on the engine. The fumes from his constant state of inebriation apparently helps fuel the plane just enough to get to land. Once the plane crashes, he then ends up in the still running blades of the plane which spins him comically (apparently) and flings him away, in a Tom and Jerry esk style. Clearly the target audience of this movie is pretty young but the tone of the rest of the film does not go with such a comic style and reduces it's enjoyment for those wanting the film to remain grounded. By all means, have comedy, but keep it witty and interesting like much of the pixar movies or one of my favourites, Rango. In recent years, Spielberg has really let the fans down because like George Lucas, he seems to favour over the top action and cheese instead of intellect and wit. Maybe if the mantle for director was handed to the pixar guys, things may have been a lot better.As I mentioned, the animation in this is stunning and it's a great medium between real actors and the usual computer graphic animation, which I think is perfect for Tintin.  Having turned Tintin and chums British, the casting hosts a lot of talented brits that i think are perfectly cast for their roles. In addition, the script is very adventurous and fun and on the whole the dialogue is good. The first half an hour in particular is enjoyable as you get immersed into the mystery and plot. However, the mindless, uninteresting, over the top and numerous action scenes, as well as the hurried pace, certainly detract from the quality of this film and left me feeling bored and uninterested the longer the film progressed. Ultimately, the best of the movie was, in general, where the script remained more true to the comics.

1323571,A3DDSAGWD0UN9H,B0034G4P4O,Discophage,"[0, 0]","Although created by the Belgian Georges Remi alias Herg&eacute;, Tintin has been adopted by France as one of its national heroes and figureheads, along with Asterix the Gaul and... Lucky Luke the cowboy and bounty-hunter, ""the man who shoots faster than his shadow"". President De Gaulle once said that he was the second most famous Frenchman after Tintin, and Tintin is very much part of every Frenchman's culture, old or young, an equivalent maybe of the Marvel and DC superheroes for Americans. In fact I think Tintin may be even more a part of French culture than the superheroes to American culture, because it is part not only of popular culture but also of high-browed culture: intellectuals, university professors or a President de la R&eacute;publique can (and should) profess to be Tintin nuts with no shame (one of the favorite games is to mention as many possible of Capitaine Haddock's insults - dictionaries have been written on that). A term has even been coined for us: ""Tintinophiles"". Everybody's a Tintinophile in France, except some foreigners. There once was a weekly comics magazine in France named after Tintin (that's where the new Herg&eacute; stories were first published, in two-page instalments if I recall), whose slogan was ""the magazine for the youths from 7 to 77"". Well, now, based on my own experience with my kids and the increase in life expectancy, make it ""5 to 105"". Maybe my parents' generation wasn't as infatuated with Tintin as mine, because comics were still then suspiciously regarded as a subculture for kids, but I see with my own kids that Tintin still ""works"" on their generation as it did with mine. And it is not just nostalgia for one's childhood. Reading again all those Tintin albums to my kids, sure, the earlier ones chronologically can be embarrassingly naive and sometimes even irritatingly dumb - Tintin in Congo, Tintin in America (but this one has this breathtaking page, just one page, where you see the native Indians chased by the army from their reservation after oil has been discovered, and a modern skyscraping city built in a day - America summarized in one page), Cigars of the Pharaoh, The Blue Lotus. There are still some nave twists of scenario in The Broken Ear, the Crab with the Golden Claws and The Shooting Star that liken them to kids literature, but with The Black Island and King Ottokar's Scepter the stories are so masterfully conceived not just in drawing but in script also that they liken Herg&eacute; to a great movie director, for young AND old - like Spielberg. And all the others, from The Secret of the Unicorn to Flight 714 to Sidney, are true masterpieces. I hadn't liked the latter so much when it first came out at the end of the 1960s. Re-reading it now, I think it is one of the best (among many ""best ones"").So, given the importance and prevalence of Tintin in French culture, and knowing what the cinema usually does with pre-existing literature it adapts - betray it - the Spielberg-Herg&eacute; encounter was an affair fraught with risk, at least for those steeped in the Tintin culture, which is probably not the case of most American viewers. In fact (and I may be here a minority opinion among French high-browed culturists) I think the film is great, because it realizes a great transmission of the relay baton between the universe of Herg&eacute; and the universe of Spielberg, the world of comics and that of film.First, there is the decision to use motion capture technique, and I think the visual result perfectly symbolizes that bridging between comics and film, with an image too artificial and slick to be ""real"" motion picture, but too ""real"" to be animation. Second, the film's very beginning explicitly and wittingly stages that transmission between Herg&eacute; and Spielberg. You are, as in the album The Secret of the Unicorn, at the Brussels flea market (I don't think the city is designated, but if you have a little Tintin culture, you know), but unlike the album it starts with a street draftsman doing a portrait of Tintin. And the penciled portrait furiously resembles the Tintin of the comics. The draftsman speaks with an unmistakable Belgian accent, and when the film shows his face: it is Herg&eacute;, and he says (I'm mentioning the line from memory here), ""hey, something gives me the impression that I've drawn you many times already"". Isn't that clever.In fact, everything is clever about the adaptation. Very clever is the conflation of two Tintin albums, The Secret of the Unicorn (Part I of Red Rackham's Treasure, which centers around Captain Haddock) and the Crab with The Golden Claws, which stages the first appearance in the Tintin series of Captain Haddock, and the transitions between both stories are brilliantly and seamlessly managed. (Incidentally everybody comments that the script also draws on Red Rackham's Treasure,the sequel of The Secret of the Unicorn, but in fact it hardly does, see below). VERY clever is to have turned what is a secondary character in the album, the collector Sakharin, into a very descendant of Red Rackham (and indeed there is a physical similarity between the two, of which Herg&eacute; failed to do anything - or maybe he meant it as a red herring, a false trail), the pendant of Captain Haddock with his ancestor Franois de Haddocque. Some critics (and some of my Tintinophile friends) have taken exception with the final battle of cranes between Haddock and Sakharin, finding it too much Hollywood action blockbuster and not enough Tintin. I think they are entirely wrong and that there is something they didn't catch: that the battle of cranes between the two scions is the pendant and modern transcription in today's technology of the battle of sabers that opposed the two ancestors; it is a brilliant invention of Spielberg and his scriptwriters, and again the symbol of that passing of the relay baton between Herg&eacute; and Spielberg.My only frustration is the ending: The Secret of the Unicorn was only the introduction to the frustrated hunt for Red Rackham's Treasure, which took Tintin, Haddock and Professor Calculus (making his first apparition on that occasion, but sadly absent from the film) all the way to the Caribbean, and a great illustration of the dictum that one doesn't need to search the hidden treasures at the world's end when they are in one's garden. In the film, because obviously Spielberg wanted it to end on a closed- rather than an open-ending, there is no ""false track"" and the ending feels very abrupt.And then, other than all these clever twists of script-writing, there is the magnificent art of Spielberg the film-maker. I haven't always been enthusiastic with Spielberg's film-making, finding it a little too block-bustering and aimed at the wider public to allow for as much subtlety and shadows as I would have liked. But here, I find the visual imagination grandiose. The way a Sahara sand dune morphs into a 17th-century galleon on a stormy sea is a breathtaking visual moment.",5,A great mixture of Herg&eacute; and Spielberg,1346630400,"09 3,

Popular in Europe through a series of graphic novels, Tintin is less well known in the US; any movie would have to appeal to both audiences.  A suitable story had to be selected from decades of plots; ""The Adventures of Tintin"" borrows elements from three.  Finally, the movie straddles the animation/live action dilemma by using live action capture.The result is a vivid, fast-moving thriller that quickly introduces the young investigative reporter Tintin and his faithful dog Snowy, and sends them off in search of clues to a mysterious ship model and a missing treasure.  Along the way, Tintin links up with the colorful Captain Haddock, who hold one of the keys to the mystery.  The three of them will survive adventures at sea and in Morocco before returning home for a final confrontation with their ruthless opponent and his minions.A clever opening sequence sets the tone for the movie, in which an artist who looks suspiciously like Tintin-creator Herge does a sketch of Tintin in a marketplace.  When Tintin accepts the finished sketch, we see both the familiar face of Tintin and Jamie Bell's movie portrayal.The story is build around plot elements from ""The Secret of the Unicorn"" and ""Red Rackham's Treasure"" to set up an audience-pleasing treasure hunt, although an inserted segment from ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"" is used to get Tintin and Captain Haddock quickly in partnership.  The plot is stitched together with a series of often frantic and sometimes over-the-top action sequences.  This reviewer wishes the producers had settled for a shorter, simpler movie that better captured the exotic but not unrealistic tone of the original stories.""The Adventures of Tintin"" is likely to appeal to new audiences for its fun and adventure, and to long-time fans for its many knowing nods at the pantheon of Tintin characters and story elements.

Third, when I finally got around to watching this movie my expectations got in the way of what I saw, a gang of thugs out to murder a boy and his dog for a scrap of paper.  Ideal subject matter for a children's movie.Why employ a photorealistic style of animation when you could just as easily achieve the same results with live action?  It felt more than a little redundant, ultimately just a nifty gimmick that worked well only part of the time.  As for the story, it's a treasure hunt/quest and an endless chase sequence.  Poor Tintin and Snowy (my favorite character) were continuously undermined, outsmarted, plagued by misfortune/misadventure, thwarted by an unbeatable enemy until the very last second when he's abruptly vanquished and summarily dismissed from the rest of the tale.  ""Great snakes!""  There is such a thing as too much plot, of things being too frantic, and not a little repetitious.  I liked parts of it but not as a whole.  There was just something off-putting about the process: real and yet not real.

1323585,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B0034G4P4O,Enjolras,"[3, 3]","I'm coming at this movie not having read or seen anything else from the Tintin franchise. I admit I really only checked it out because of Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg's involvement. I liked the film overall, but had mixed feelings.First, the animation is incredible. The movie really blurs the line between live-action and animation. The characters all look realistic, except for their big noses. You can see the characters' pores and individual strands of hair. Moreover, the characters really look like they're acting. Every once in a while you'd see Tintin give a subtle glance full of emotion. I absolutely love the look of the film and hope more animation is done in this style.However, I'm not sure the ultra-realistic animation style fit the style of Tintin. This particularly came out during the movie's attempts at humor and the more ""cartoonish"" moments. The animation style takes this movie outside the realm of ""cartoon"", so it just seemed odd when the movie took a cartoonish approach to humor. For example, the Captain Haddock character burping alcohol just seemed disgusting, not funny. Also, when the characters are thrown around without any regard for the laws of physics, it removes suspension of disbelief. Ultimately, I think parts of the movie were victims of the success of the animation. In retrospect, I can understand why other animated movies intentionally take an exaggerated approach.Another problem with the movie is the plot. It's just sterile and boring. It's a routine treasure hunt, but there's nothing particularly exciting about the treasure or the villains or the plot twists. It's pretty straightforward with few genuine surprises. The characters take a long journey just to find a small pot of gold and jewels in a house. It seems like Tintin has an exciting life, but he comes off as vanilla. This movie was for Americans an introduction to Tintin and I could tell this just wasn't one of his more exciting adventures. Maybe something more along the lines of a murder investigation would have been more gripping.Don't get me wrong - overall, I enjoyed Tintin. I think because so much of the movie is done so well, those little problems become that much more glaring. I'd definitely encourage Spielberg and Jackson to make another Tintin movie, this time with a bit more emphasis on plot.",4,"Great CG, sterile story",1331942400,"03 17, 2012",2012,2332,"[""'m"", 'coming', 'movie', 'not', 'having', 'read', 'seen', 'anything', 'else', 'Tintin', 'franchise', 'admit', 'really', 'only', 'checked', 'out', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'involvement', 'liked', 'film', 'overall', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings.First', 'animation', 'incredible', 'movie', 'really', 'line', 'live-action', 'animation', 'characters', 'look', 'realistic', 'big', 'noses', 'can', 'see', 'characters', 'pores', 'individual', 'strands', 'hair', 'Moreover', 'characters', 'really', 'look', ""'re"", 'acting', 'once', 'while', ""'d"", 'see', 'Tintin', 'give', 'subtle', 'glance', 'full', 'emotion', 'absolutely', 'love', 'look', 'film', 'hope', 'more', 'animation', 'done', 'style.However', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'ultra-realistic', 'animation', 'style', 'fit', 'style', 'Tintin', 'particularly', 'came', 'out', 'movie', 'attempts', 'humor', 'more', 'cartoonish', 'moments', 'animation', 'style', 'movie', 'realm', 'cartoon', 'just', 'seemed', 'odd', 'when', 'movie', 'took', 'cartoonish', 'approach', 'humor', 'example', 'Captain', 'Haddock', 'character', 'burping', 'alcohol', 'just', 'seemed', 'disgusting', 'not', 'funny', 'Also', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'thrown', 'regard', 'laws', 'physics', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'Ultimately', 'think', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'victims', 'success', 'animation', 'retrospect', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'other', 'animated', 'movies', 'intentionally', 'take', 'exaggerated', 'approach.Another', 'problem', 'movie', 'plot', 'just', 'sterile', 'boring', 'routine', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'exciting', 'treasure', 'villains', 'plot', 'twists', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'few', 'genuine', 'surprises', 'characters', 'take', 'long', 'journey', 'just', 'find', 'small', 'pot', 'gold', 'jewels', 'house', 'Tintin', 'exciting', 'life', 'off', 'vanilla', 'movie', 'was', 'Americans', 'introduction', 'Tintin', 'could', 'tell', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'more', 'exciting', 'adventures', 'Maybe', 'something', 'more', 'lines', 'murder', 'investigation', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'gripping.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'overall', 'enjoyed', 'Tintin', 'think', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'little', 'problems', 'become', 'much', 'more', 'glaring', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'encourage', 'Spielberg', 'Jackson', 'make', 'Tintin', 'movie', 'time', 'bit', 'more', 'emphasis', 'plot']",N/A

The screenplay wouldn't be understandable to anyone who might enjoy the labored physical comedy. The humor would make most grade-schoolers roll their eyes.Spielberg thinks if there is one second of film without constant agitation and motion with big swooping camera movements, he will lose the attention of the audience. But that kind of thing actually has the opposite effect; faced with the constant barrage of meaningless, overly-choreographed action, the viewer can't help but retreat their attention, possibly into a nap. It's like watching clothes go around and around in the dryer for two hours.

And Captain Haddock was captured down to a pat.-absolutely classic.The film combines three Tintin adventure books-The Secret of the Unicorn, Red Rackham's Treasure, andThe Crab with the Golden ClawsIt begins with Tintin's innocent purchase at a flew market of a model 17th century ship which leads to his life being endangered and on a thrilling, dangerous adventure.Also like the touch of the evil Professor Saccharin being Red Rackham's  descendant bent on a centuries  long feud with the Captains' descendantsAction scenes were a little long but this is an action adventure after all.Also liked how the scenes effortlessly moved in the Captain's delirium from the desert to his battles with Red Rackham.A little disappointed about no adventures for Tintin and friends in the Caribbean as in the book of Red Rackham's Treasure.But the touch of brining in opera diva Bianca Castafiore was quite amusing. A lot of the dialogue was amusing and a a great inspirational speech by Haddock near the end when Tintin is ready to give up. 'Failed. There are plenty of others willing to call you a failure. A fool. A loser. A hopeless souse. Don't you ever say it of yourself. You send out the wrong signal, that is what people pick up. Don't you understand? You care about something, you fight for it.

1323608,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0034G4P4O,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 5]","Spielberg releasing two movies in the same month? And two supremely crafted movies, at that? Ach, the flaunting of the man! Seriously, though, WAR HORSE and THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN are both epic cinema and should be viewed, maybe several times. Here in the States, you hear the name ""Tintin"" and scratch your noggin and maybe venture a guess: ""Is a heroic dog, no?"" No. Once upon a time, Georges Prosper Remi - more popularly known in Europe as Herg&eacute;, but barely known here - created THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN, a comic strip beloved throughout the length and breadth of Europe. Spielberg is a big fan of Tintin and years ago was able to garner the rights to shoot a film adaptation. Herg&eacute; passed away in 1983, but odds are - in spite of certain liberties taken (not the least of which is the visual look of Tintin himself) - he would've been proud of what Spielberg wrought. Keep an eye out for a Herg&eacute; cameo during the opening sequence. He's the illustrator drawing a caricature of Tintin.It's no coincidence that an Indiana Jones flavor suffuses the narrative (yes, I played the Indy Jones card). The comic strip often propelled Tintin into many a pulp adventure. There's an old time feel here, redolent of those Saturday serial reels, of wild cliffhangers and derring-dos. Tintin looks like a kid - especially with that upswept tuft of hair - but he is well regarded in the community, is treated like an adult. Everyone knows who he is. Tintin is a daring reporter who doesn't hesitate to go after a story. This time, Tintin senses a mystery behind a ship's model of a 17th century man-o'war, which is coveted by several shady characters. Tintin's suspicions are confirmed when he unearths a cryptic scroll hidden within the ship's mast. What happens next, you can call it investigative journalism or a headlong leap into adventure. In any case, Tintin and his clever dog, Snowy, are soon dodging bullets and up to their necks in exotic locales and embroiled in an epic treasure hunt. Apartments are ransacked. There are frequent eruptions of gunfire. Skulls are occasionally ka-bonked. Perilous chases ensue, and fisticuffs. There be even pirates... and opera singers. In one instance of skulking about - as Tintin is about to ""borrow"" a set of keys - he is given a heads up about one particular goonish sleeper in the room: ""He's a light sleeper, on account of the tragic loss of his eyelids."" I really love that line.If you're down with the comic strip, then the plot may be familiar. It's lifted (but tweaked a bit) from three existing Tintin exploits (""The Crab with the Golden Claws,"" ""The Secret of the Unicorn,"" and ""Red Rackham's Treasure""). Familiar characters surface as the film progresses. Those hapless law enforcers, Thompson & Thompson, pop in and provide comic relief (they're played by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost). ""Policework isn't all glamour and guns. There's an awful lot of failing,"" proclaims Thompson, or was it the other Thompson? Mostly, they're just here for show, relegated to trying to nab a notorious pickpocket. More relevant is Captain Haddock, the hard-drinking sea captain and the last surviving Haddock, ancestor of him what stowed away 400 weight of gold. Haddock's ravaged memory is key to unlocking the riddle of the scroll. But drink has done in the captain's synapses. His memory is shot (or is it?). As Haddock, Andy Sirkis, master of capture performance CG, is quite awesome. Have they started doling out awards yet for best capture performance performance?Parents contemplating taking their young 'uns to this one is advised that there is massive gunplay, with Tintin even busting out a gat on one occasion. Mostly, I think the film adheres to the spirit and tone of the source. Time and place are evocative of the 1940s. Tintin is intrepid and noble and idealistic (and, let's face it, sort of bland; the dog Snowy and Haddock always did provide the color). Spielberg and co-conspirator Peter Jackson got all ambitious with the visuals. The performance capture CG is exquisite. I marveled at the vivid attention to detail. The hardest thing to render in CG is the hair, how it sits on the character's head, how it moves, how it looks. But even this was pulled off convincingly. The animation style is photorealistic, except that there are enough bulbous noses going around that a whimsical touch manages to peep thru. There are many spectacular panoramic scenes to absorb, such as Tintin's plane floundering thru a mammoth storm or the sailing ship ripping thru the sand dunes of the Sahara. Near the end, my jaw dropped several times during that exhilarating chase in the streets and on the rooftops of Morocco. ""Blistering barnacles!"" to quote a Haddock. Thanks to ever-advancing CG technology, anything truly is possible. Even Haddock's nose hairs are impeccably rendered.",5,"""He's a light sleeper, on account of the tragic loss of his eyelids.""",1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,4843,"['Spielberg', 'releasing', 'two',

So we will have one film every Yule season, at least, if the actors survive the series or do not age too fast, though the digital processing of them enables them to age unseen in their digital skins.The choice of technology and actors is perfect for those roles that are so well known that they do not admit any kind of mistake. The Dupont-ds are supposed to be perfect, and what's more perfectly dumb and inefficient, which they are. The very antagonistic representation of the Belgian policeman or inspector seen as Hercule Poirot for example. I must say the dog, Milou, is less convincing in that processing. He is processed slightly too much and smells as if he were just out of the dog's beauty parlor. The Castafiore is a marvelous superb operatic monster and she is truer than she could be in real reality.The story is an old pirate story and Captain Haddock is an ignominious drunkard but he is fabulous in the desert and when he is reliving the adventures of his ancestor. At that level the film is quite a success for those who like pirate films and sea fights with sail ships, fire, canon powder, sabers and swords, etc. The falcon is also a good chap who fulfils his part quite well.What Spielberg managed with great success is the great variety of landscapes, seascapes and other locations that is extremely important in this comic strip that leads the readers from the popular suburban areas of Brussels to the Sahara desert, the French foreign legion, the Atlantic by boat and the Atlantic by hydroplane, the unstable setting of a ship or a flying plane, as well as the disturbed stable setting of a city of a harbor. The duel with harbor cranes is quite a good idea indeed and spectacular.Those of you who have known Tintin when you were the same age as the comic books will find it realistically done. Those who are from a younger generation will like the action and the special effects, and of course the chase for the treasure. You will only get the first leg of it right now, but next year, it is a promise, you get the second leg. After that If I believe the images of the opening credits you are going to get  the moon, Tournesol and quite a few more of these adventures. I saw an allusion to Tibet too which is an earlier period, hence surprising.

1323629,A3H9PLV6L2S194,B0034G4P4O,Jim Davis,"[0, 0]","My introduction to the Tintin adventures was back in the 1960s when my father brought me back a copy of the Golden Press edition of &#34;Explorers on the Moon&#34; when he returned from a trip. Being very much a space fan I was thrilled and reread the book many times. &#34;Explorers&#34; was probably not the most representative Tintin adventure given the locale but it did have all the hallmarks of the Tintin adventures - great plotting, great characters, and wonderful touches of humor.I am pleased to report that the film version has all these hallmarks as well. After hundreds of reviews there is not much I can add but a few impressions.1. The feel of this film was exactly right. There was no attempt to bring it up to date and introduce 21st century technology, social issues, political concerns, strong female characters or the like. The setting looked just like its comic strip inspiration - the world of the 1930s.2. The animation was unbelievably realistic. If not for the cartoonish features of most of the characters one could almost think it was live action in places. One wonders how long it will be before there is no way to tell the difference.3. The action sequences were, as one might expect, well beyond what was depicted in the comics. This usually worked well (the crane fight was superb) but occasionally was over the top (the chase sequence in the North African city, and the sea battle between the Unicorn and the other ship where the latter goes over the former and both are afire).

I was amazed multiple times during the movie at the detail in the characters and in the backgrounds of the locations depicted in the scenes.Tintin is a young but respected reporter who will pursue a good story until it is solved and the truth is known.  While at a city market Tintin buys a beautiful model ship named the Unicorn.  It was a real three mast freighter sailed by Captain Haddock.  It was lost at sea and as rumor has it only Captain Haddock survived an attack by pirates lead by the infamous Red Rackham.  Immediately upon buying the model two men want to buy it and pay more than Tintin just paid for it.  He profoundly says no as it is his new found treasure.  Little does he know the adventure that this ship will lead him on!What follows is two hours of intense action in the style of Indiana Jones.  The movie is well portrayed by the CGI characters and you will get to be involved in their personalities as the animation is so good they seem real.  The mystery has villains, heroes and treasure while leading Tintin and his trusty dog Snowy into hazardous situations around the world.  Planes, ships, automobiles, and motorcycles will be used in chase scenes and battles throughout the movie.I know virtually nothing about the Tintin saga but the never ending action will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Spielberg has done a wonderful job of making this movie and my grandson was mesmerized by the story and action. I won't go in into the storyline at all as not to provide spoilers but I took over two pages of notes on this movie.  It was entrancing to watch and enjoy.My wife and grandson said it was 5 stars and I said 4 1/2.  I was a little lower as the action was almost too much at times, but it was still an enjoyable entertainment feature.

TinTin discovers that the model has a secret clue that leads to a great treasure buried somewhere years ago where he and his faithful dog Snowy get kidnapped while his 2 bumbling detective friends Thompson and Thompson (Voiced and performed by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost) are trying to solve the mystery of the wallet theif that has been going around lately. TinTin meets an alcoholic captain named Archibald Haddock (Voiced and performed by Andy Serkis) as they team up to find other clues that can lead to the treasure.A beautifully rendered and complex yet hilarious animated adventure from Steven Spielberg and producer Peter Jackson with co-writer Edgar Wright that nicely adapts 3 TinTin comics into one movie. Since 1984 Spielberg obtained the rights for a TinTin movie but after years of waiting in 2008 he greenlighted the movie and used his friend James Cameron's Avatar technology for his movie as he decided to make a full length Motion Capture animated movie out of the beloved Herge comics. I am an American who grew up with the HBO cartoon in the early 90s as a kid and became a fan of the character as i knew someday they should do a movie on it, i saw this movie 4 times in theaters and loved it. WETA who did impressive work with Lord of the Rings, Avatar, King Kong and Rise of the Planet of the Apes has done yet another outstanding achievement this time but as a full length motion capture animated movie. This one is far better than what Robert Zemeckis attempted so far as the characters are fully realistic including no dead empty eyes but soul at last including realistic renderings on hair, skin including fuzz on skin, clothes, animals and all that as it's very impressive including using stretched chins/noses to bulb noses.

1323638,ATQMXB565D9LR,B0034G4P4O,Jon Bastian,"[2, 3]","While I had heard of TinTin, I never read the comic strip and had no emotional attachment to the character. Apparently, lots of people do. However, I have a feeling that those people are not into hyperactive 3D movies with animation that is alternately super-realistic and ultra-cartoonish. (Read: older generation.) At the same time, for those of us who wouldn't know TinTin from Rin Tin Tin, the film is lacking a central character we can really latch onto.It's kind of a shame, because as animated by Spielberg & Co. and acted by Jamie Bell, this TinTin person is kind of likeable. He's attractive, he's smart, he's almost human... and yet... there's just something off about him and his world. TinTin himself actually makes it through what's called the ""uncanny valley,"" which is a term among 3D animators. Basically, when a character falls into that area, it means that they are realistic enough to be human, but at the same time there's something inhuman about them. The human brain can't really process the contradiction, and so the character just seems weird and off-putting. This was the state of the art about five years ago.Now, TinTin makes it through the valley and seems very real, but the problem is that I'm not really sure how old he's supposed to be. Visually, he really looks like an adolescent, with his flawless skin and short pants, and Bell's youthful voice adds to that illusion. When we first meet him, he also takes immediate interest in a model ship at a flea market stand -- something which seems like a teen boy interest, not an adult one. And yet... TinTin is apparently a famous journalist who has his own (rather posh) apartment.Again, if I were familiar with the comic strip, this would probably all make sense. They stopped publishing the original TinTin comics in 1976, if Wikipedia is to be believed. I think you can see the disconnect between the source material and the audience right there.So... we have this totally autonomous but realistically animated teen boy running around on his own. Meanwhile, he's accompanied by his faithful dog Snowy. Now, while Snowy is an endearing character, he also falls sharply on the other side of the uncanny valley -- that is, way too animated looking to be realistic. And so do most of the other human characters that we meet. While it may be true to the original comic, this is where everything falls apart. Cartoonish denizens of this world would be totally acceptable if the entire film were done in old school 2D animation style, or if TinTin himself did not look so real. The two together, though, are just visually jarring, and took me right out of everything the first time that ""real-ish"" TinTin met his first cartoon-face human.I won't even get into the plot, which rockets TinTin into his adventures, and then lets him conveniently stumble upon one clue after another way too quickly. I can feel Mr. Spielberg's love and nostalgia for the material, but he should have left it in the visual vernacular of its era. This is a perfect example of ""sometimes, the most advanced technology is not the best tool for telling the story."" The sets, lighting, physical animation and all of that is beautiful, and stunningly real when it wants to be. As a bunch of pretty pictures, the film is a knockout. However... pictures are not a story. Humans are. When a couple of your humans -- mainly the hero and villain -- look like real people, while everyone else looks like either an animation test gone wrong or the grotesque failure of a genetic experiment, empathy becomes impossible.That said, this is probably the perfect film to stick the grandparents and kids in front of, because both of them will find something to relate to. But if you're between 6 and 60... you'll find yourself humming the scenery, wondering what TinTin really does for his money (blackmail Belgian priests?) and, while admiring Mr. Spielberg's always incredible mastery of film making, lament that he wasted it on this labor of love that never could have found an audience, because the combination of source and realization were born to be at complete odds with each other.If only he'd gone full live-action, he might have given TinTin to a new generation. Instead, in trying to pander to both, he's satisfied neither, and dropped everything right into the middle of that uncanny valley.",2,"Right in the Uncanny Valley, with No Natural Audience",1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,4339,"['had', 'heard', 'TinTin', 'never', 'read', 'comic', 'strip', 'had', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'character', 'Apparently', 'lots', 'people', 'do', 'However', 'have', 'feeling', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'hyperactive', '3D', 'movies', 'animation', 'alternately', 'super-realistic', 'ultra-cartoonish', 'Read', 'older', 'generation', 'same', 'time', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'TinTin', 'Rin', 'Tin', 'Tin', 'film', 'lacking', 'central', 'character', 'can', 'really', 'latch', 'onto.It', 'kind', 'shame', 'animated', 'Spielberg', 'Co.', 'acted', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'TinTin', 'person', 'kind', 'likeable', 'attractive', 'smart', 'almost', 'human', 'yet', 'just', 'something', 'off', 'world', 'TinTin', 'actually', 'what', 'called', 'uncanny', 'valley', 'term', '3D', 'animators', 'Basically', 'when', 'character', 'area', 'are', 'realistic', 'enough', 'be', 'human', 'same', 'time', 'something', 'inhuman', 'human', 'brain', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'process', 'contradiction', 'so', 'character', 'just', 'weird', 'off-putting', 'was', 'state', 'art', 'five', 'years', 'ago.Now', 'TinTin', 'valley', 'very', 'real', 'problem', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'how', 'old', 'supposed', 'be', 'Visually', 'really', 'adolescent', 'flawless', 'skin', 'short', 'pants', 'Bell', 'youthful', 'voice', 'illusion', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'also', 'immediate', 'interest', 'model', 'ship', 'flea', 'market', 'stand', 'something', 'teen', 'boy', 'interest', 'not', 'adult', 'one', 'yet', 'TinTin', 'apparently', 'famous', 'journalist', 'who', 'own', 'rather', 'posh', 'apartment.Again', 'were', 'familiar', 'comic', 'strip', 'would', 'probably', 'make', 'sense', 'stopped', 'publishing', 'original', 'TinTin', 'comics', '1976', 'Wikipedia', 'be', 'believed', 'think', 'can', 'see', 'disconnect', 'source', 'material', 'audience', 'right', 'there.So', 'have', 'totally', 'autonomous', 'realistically', 'animated', 'teen', 'boy', 'running', 'around', 'own', 'Meanwhile', 'accompanied', 'faithful', 'dog', 'Snowy', 'Now', 'Snowy', 'endearing', 'character', 'also', 'sharply', 'other', 'side', 'uncanny', 'valley', 'way', 'too', 'animated', 'looking', 'be', 'realistic', 'so', 'do', 'most', 'other', 'human', 'characters', 'meet', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'original', 'comic', 'where', 'everything', 'apart', 'Cartoonish', 'denizens', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'totally', 'acceptable', 'entire', 'film', 'were', 'done', 'old', 'school', '2D', 'animation', 'style', 'TinTin', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'so', 'real', 'two', 'together', 'are', 'just', 'visually', 'jarring', 'took', 'right', 'everything', 'first', 'time', 'real-ish', 'TinTin', 'met', 'first', 'cartoon-face', 'human.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'plot', 'TinTin', 'adventures', 'then', 'conveniently', 'stumble', 'one', 'clue', 'way', 'too', 'quickly', 'can', 'feel', 'Mr.', 'Spielberg', 'love', 'nostalgia', 'material', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'visual', 'vernacular', 'era', 'perfect', 'example', 'sometimes', 'most', 'advanced', 'technology', 'not', 'best', 'tool', 'telling', 'story', 'sets', 'lighting', 'physical', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'stunningly', 'real', 'when', 'be', 'bunch', 'pretty', 'pictures', 'film', 'knockout', 'However', 'pictures', 'are', 'not', 'story', 'Humans', 'are', 'When', 'couple', 'humans', 'mainly', 'hero', 'villain', 'look', 'real', 'people', 'everyone', 'else', 'animation', 'test', 'gone', 'wrong', 'grotesque', 'failure', 'genetic', 'experiment', 'empathy', 'becomes', 'said', 'probably', 'perfect', 'film', 'stick', 'grandparents', 'kids', 'front', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'relate', ""'re"", '6', '60', ""'ll"", 'find', 'humming', 'scenery', 'wondering', 'what', 'TinTin', 'really', 'money', 'blackmail', 'Belgian', 'priests', 'admiring', 'Mr.', 'Spielberg', 'always', 'incredible', 'mastery', 'film', 'making', 'lament', 'wasted', 'labor', 'love', 'never', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'audience', 'combination', 'source', 'realization', 'were', 'born', 'be', 'complete', 'odds', 'other.If', 'only', ""'d"", 'gone', 'full', 'live-action', 'might', 'have', 'given', 'TinTin', 'new', 'generation', 'Instead', 'trying', 'pander', 'satisfied', 'dropped', 'everything', 'right', 'middle', 'uncanny', 'valley']",N/A

Tintin is not just your average animated film. So believe me when I say this movie is well worth your time. Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg are two of the best film makers and they do not disappoint with The Adventures of Tintin. The title character Tintin, is played by Jamie Bell; I think he did a wonderful job with his approach and the intensity he brought to the character. Daniel Craig takes a break from 007 and plays the bad guy Ivan Sakharine; he also did a marvelous job. My favorite character who brought a lot of the humor to the movie was Captain Haddock played by Andy Serkis. So to sum up my review: Tintin has: humor, adventure, action, interesting storyline, and great visuals for an animated film in my opinion.

Ridgway ""Ridge""","[1, 1]","I recommend this motion-capture animated adventure to families who don't want their movies to be spoiled by foul language or other cultural toxins.  It's an action movie (Indiana Jones for Kids, some other reviewer said) that is an enjoyable ride, if somewhat over-the-top frenetic at times.  Especially the chase scene when they are rushing out of Morocco, is frenetic to the point of ridiculousness.  But, the motion-capture animation is incredibly realistic and makes you think sometimes that you're seeing a real film.  The characters of Tintin, Captain Haddock, Snowy and the evil Sakharine (descendent of Red Rackham) are very enjoyable to watch!  The plot line is fun, albeit unrealistic, but this is Tintin, after all!Flaws in my opinion:  (1) over-the-top frenetic action by Spielberg is geared towards the limited attention span of today's video-playing youth; (2) there actually is a lot of violence (shooting mostly, and fist fighting), but in a cartoonish sort of way.  Being like an Indiana Jones flick you'd expect that, but for young kids, parents beware that lots of ""bad guys"" get killed.Drinking: You know, you call it a ""kid's movie"" but the subject of drinking and sobriety is handled in a pretty adult way (in a good sense) in Tintin.  Captain Haddock is a funny drunk at first but then he gets sober and he becomes a much more admirable character.  I like this responsible attitude re drinking, or getting high in general, which many other sophomoric Hollywood films could use.Overall though, it's enjoyable adventure and even intelligent at times! Which is more than I can say, for example, about the 2011 Three Musketeers.

While looking to pierce the mystery of the Unicorn, Tintin and Snowy encounter Capitain Haddock, and the three of them continue this adventure through the Karaboudjan (Haddock's ship), the Sahara, and Brussels.Visually speaking, this movie is by far the most accomplished animation movie ever made. This can be seen with the characters, who are all amazingly drawn and animated at a point it is troubling. They look indeed so real, but yet specific &#34;Comic book&#34; elements are kept. That allows Spielberg to show unbelievable scene - like the one in Bagghar - that would annoy in a realistic movies, but are simply enjoyed in this case. You can compare this to Myazaki's movies, which shows believable character in situation not so believable, but some little moments (inertia, size of the tears, etc.) help for the movie coherence.So yes, the characters animation is astonishing. The action scenes are great too, though not as detailed as the characters. Yet a 10/10 for the reatlisation for sure!As for the story, many people got upset that two stories are mixed to produce one movie, or that Professor Calculus wasn't introduce. The fact is that the movie feels a bit long - especially at the end - and has multiple slow moments. I think people who read Tintin as a kid/teenager had a &#34;too much/too little&#34; feeling after this movie, hoping for more and regretting some parts.My understanding is that Spielberg use these Comics to make an adventure movie, and he succeeded in it: it is thrilling, interesting, funny and Comic-y. However, there are two moments that creates problem.- The first is the rememberance of Haddock about his ancestor, which is a way to introduce the plot of the next movie, more than explaining this movie's story. This wasn't necessary, and could have been kept for the beginning of the second movie.- The second is the final battle. It lacks (in my opinion) the intensity shown during the scene in Bagghar. Therefore, you end the movie on a smaller note than what you would expect, and therefore a bit disapointmentApart from these points, there is no deception.If you are a kid, you will enjoy all of the adventures and the insults Capitain Haddock is yelling.If you are a young adult, you will be fascinating by the visual quality of this movie.If you are an older adult, you will appreciate this kid movie (because it is a kid movie) without the bad humour so many animation movies are showing these time..

1323659,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B0034G4P4O,K. Ostrowski,"[6, 7]","Let me start this off by leveling with you.  I don't come at this movie from the perspective of someone who knows nothing about the franchise.  You see, I've read virtually all of the Tintin comics, though I never saw the animated series.  I know these characters and what they're all about.Fortunately, fans of the comics won't need to suffer the disappointment of character derailment in this movie.  Every last character is spot-on.  Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, Thompson & Thompson...  It's all there.  If you read and enjoyed the comics, you'll find much of what you enjoyed in this film as well.I say ""much,"" because while a certain amount of excitement was also common in the comics, they were largely mystery-based, rather than action, and this film has very strong and almost-constant action and suspense elements to it, though its penchant for mystery, treasure-hunting and adventure remain as strong as in the comics it was based on.However, now it's time for the fanboy in me to take a back seat and explain some of what this film is actually about for those not familiar with the character of Tintin (who, it must be admitted, is something of a niche character outside of Europe.)Tintin, a young reporter and seeker of secrets and stories, buys a model ship in the marketplace one day, while he's out for a walk.  Immediately, two men try to buy it off him, but he doesn't sell, because he realizes something must be up with it.  A series of accidents, investigations and crimes lead him to uncover an old poem which seems to promise a great treasure to those who can unlock the secret of ""the three unicorns sailing in company.""However, Tintin and his friends will need to fight for their lives, because another man; Saccharine is looking for the same treasure, and that's not all he's looking for.  He's willing to stop at nothing to get what he wants, even if it involves kidnapping, torture, thievery and murder.  Tintin is fast action, high adventure and a thrilling mystery all rolled into one.Now, specifically to those who've tried to claim that Tintin rips off Indiana Jones.  It would be more likely that the reverse was true, since Tintin comics were published from 1929 to 1976, and Raiders of the Lost Ark wasn't released until 1981.  However, it's almost universally recognized that what Indy really rips off is Allan Quatermain, so I won't make that claim.  Needless to say, if you think this film is a ripoff of Indy, you're simply wrong, and that's all there is to it.What this film is, is simply fun.  Good, clean fun with some nice action sequences and several very good chase scenes.  It's a well-done ride, and as icing on the cake, a bit of Catholic history comes up at one point during the movie.Herge himself (the comic's author) was Catholic, and writing for a Catholic publication, which only elevates my respect for the series, as you might imagine.  It's a great series, and a very good movie as well, and I think the main reason is that Stephen Speilburg and Peter Jackson seem to have realized that they just shouldn't mess with what obviously works.  Kudos to them for understanding this, and for their faithfulness to the source material.I recommend this movie to anyone looking for good, clean fun, or anyone who likes a nice, hair-raising adventure.  There's guns and alcohol in it, but it's all treated appropriately, I think.  I don't even think kids would have too many problems with this movie, to be honest.  I know I didn't, and I hope many other Tintin fans will get as much out of it as I did.",5,"Much, much better than I was expecting",1331337600,"03 10, 2012",2012,3551,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'leveling', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'movie', 'perspective', 'someone', 'who', 'nothing', 'franchise', 'see', ""'ve"", 'read', 'virtually', 'Tintin', 'comics', 'never', 'saw', 'animated', 'series', 'know', 'characters', 'what', ""'re"", 'about.Fortunately', 'fans', 'comics', 'wo', ""n't"", 'need', 'suffer', 'disappointment', 'character', 'derailment', 'movie', 'last', 'character', 'spot-on', 'Tintin', 'Snowy', 'Captain', 'Haddock', 'Thompson', 'Thompson', 'there', 'read', 'enjoyed', 'comics', ""'ll"", 'find', 'much', 'what', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'well.I', 'say', 'much', 'certain', 'amount', 'excitement', 'was', 'also', 'common', 'comics', 'were', 'largely', 'mystery-based', 'rather', 'action', 'film', 'very', 'strong', 'almost-constant', 'action', 'suspense', 'elements', 'penchant', 'mystery', 'treasure-hunting', 'adventure', 'remain', 'as', 'strong', 'comics', 'was', 'based', 'on.However', 'now', 'time', 'fanboy', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'explain', 'what', 'film', 'actually', 'not', 'familiar', 'character', 'Tintin', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'admitted', 'something', 'niche', 'character', 'Europe', 'Tintin', 'young', 'reporter', 'seeker', 'secrets', 'stories', 'model', 'ship', 'marketplace', 'one', 'day', 'out', 'walk', 'Immediately', 'two', 'men', 'try', 'buy', 'off', ""n't"", 'sell', 'something', 'must', 'be', 'up', 'A', 'series', 'accidents', 'investigations', 'crimes', 'lead', 'uncover', 'old', 'poem', 'promise', 'great', 'treasure', 'who', 'can', 'unlock', 'secret', 'three', 'unicorns', 'sailing', 'company', 'However', 'Tintin', 'friends', 'will', 'need', 'fight', 'lives', 'man', 'Saccharine', 'looking', 'same', 'treasure', 'not', 'looking', 'willing', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'what', 'even', 'kidnapping', 'torture', 'thievery', 'murder', 'Tintin', 'fast', 'action', 'high', 'adventure', 'thrilling', 'mystery', 'rolled', 'one.Now', 'specifically', 'who', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'claim', 'Tintin', 'rips', 'off', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'likely', 'reverse', 'was', 'true', 'Tintin', 'comics', 'were', 'published', '1929', '1976', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'was', ""n't"", 'released', '1981', 'However', 'almost', 'universally', 'recognized', 'what', 'Indy', 'really', 'off', 'Allan', 'Quatermain', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'claim', 'Needless', 'say', 'think', 'film', 'ripoff', 'Indy', ""'re"", 'simply', 'wrong', 'it.What', 'film', 'simply', 'fun', 'Good', 'clean', 'fun', 'nice', 'action', 'sequences', 'several', 'very', 'good', 'chase', 'scenes', 'well-done', 'ride', 'icing', 'cake', 'bit', 'Catholic', 'history', 'up', 'one', 'point', 'movie.Herge', 'comic', 'author', 'was', 'Catholic', 'writing', 'Catholic', 'publication', 'only', 'respect', 'series', 'might', 'imagine', 'great', 'series', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'well', 'think', 'main', 'reason', 'Stephen', 'Speilburg', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'seem', 'have', 'realized', 'just', 'should', ""n't"", 'mess', 'what', 'obviously', 'Kudos', 'understanding', 'faithfulness', 'source', 'material.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'looking', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'anyone', 'who', 'nice', 'hair-raising', 'adventure', 'guns', 'alcohol', 'treated', 'appropriately', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'kids', 'would', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'problems', 'movie', 'be', 'honest', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'hope', 'many', 'other', 'Tintin', 'fans', 'will', 'get', 'as', 'much', 'did']",N/A

David Spielberg has done some great stuff, but a lot of it is very strange mash-ups with weird storylines.  This story was clear and straightforward.Yes, it was a touch frenetic, but it told an old-fashioned tale that is SO not modern movie!  There was no madman out to destroy the world, no evil corporation with military cohorts (or vice versa) - just that a blackhearted  villian has stolen a map and with his gang is trying to find a treasure.  They don't turn into skeletons and walk underwater, either.We watched this for ""movie night"" in a room of ten adults (no kids) and everyone loved it. Knowing Spielberg I expected a) politically correct censuring and b) obnoxious kids and c) my son kept asking when the aliens were going to come through from the sky in their spaceship.  (If fact, all the adults kept saying, ""NOW the aliens will come!"" all through the movie.)None of that.  It really had the feel of an old-fashioned 1930's movie, despite the modern animation.  It was an excellent combination of the natural and fantasy -  I felt I could enjoy it without that strange disorientation I got from, say, ""Polar Express"".Now, if you have kids, there was fighting and the combo of fantasy animation and reality could be intense for younger ones.  Also, if you don't like movies for your kids with guns this will probably not be the one for you.  There is a touch of blood, too  - an assassinated agent marks a newspaper with a secret message with it.  So it's really not a ""little ones"" movie.  It's not a ""G"".

Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[1, 2]","This is a fun, swash-buckling style adventure, centered around TinTin, an intrepid young reporter who stumbles upon a strange mystery involving ship models, and an old ship sinking mystery. He teams up with a ship captain also embroiled in the mystery, and together they end up traveling around the world in search of answers, pursued by others on the trail of the same mystery. On the plus side, there is a lot of action and chase scenes, an adorable and hilarious dog, and some equally humorous bumbling Interpol detectives. The animation is  compelling, in the 'real-life' style of Polar Express.My only reservation was the gun violence, and the theme of the drunken captain - the captain needs to remember a secret handed down through his family, and at first can't remember because he drinks too much, then starts to remember only when he drinks. He struggles with his drinking throughout the film, and many of the jokes center on this, so I had to try and explain what 'drunk' and 'sober' were to my kids (ages 5-8) in order for them to follow. Also there's a lot of gun shooting in this movie, although little blood (this is in keeping with the source comics.)

He looks like a boy, (well sort of!), but has all the strength and abilities of a man,lives alone, carries and use guns frequently and is more than capable of knocking full grown huge thugs out with his fists.It's sanitised of course, ......he shoots a lot but the direction is contrived so that you never see him actually hit anyone, ...much less kill them.It was conflicting messages for me, but then as I mentioned above, I'm a bit of a newcomer to Tin-tin.Positives first: It's BEAUTIFULLY drawn in most cases. Clever, ...even witty illustration in parts, specially during the wipes; and the textures and effects are visually very captivating. The water, the fire, etc. are exceptional.I do have issues with the motion capture process used, which at times had some characters looking like a human actor's body just wearing a huge caricature mask over their head. This was most obvious on the Captain character.Now I am one who can usually quite willingly park my brain in the foyer and suspend disbelief for the duration of a movie that creates a fantasy.That being said, I enjoyed the beginning of this movie where it sort of stuck almost within the bounds of possibility, ...or even went just beyond.However as it progressed, the action really ""jumps the shark""! Shark? More like leaps the leviathan!Yes I know it's a cartoon but the extreme and constant OTT exaggerated and impossible action scenes just left me saying ""Yeah right, ...like THAT'S ever gonna happen"" after a while.And it's kept at that frenetic level for most of the second half.Spielburg has never been one for restraint or subtlety in any of his movies, and let's just say he doesn't go against character in this one. There's certainly no build up to an exciting action bit, then releasing of tension so that it can be built up again sort of thing. It's just full-throttle all the time. All of which has the effect of over-kill for meI would have appreciated just a little more of a nod to the original Herg&eacute; material by way of keeping it more ""boys-own-adventure"", rather than the Indiana Jones on hyper-steroids approach.I certainly enjoyed it for the animation, ....apart from the bodies with big carnival heads I've already mentioned.I still think Spielberg has ""aged"" Tintin too much, creating a conflict in the audience's mind between his appearance and what we see him do.

What a really well done photo-realistic, motion capture animated film That I saw tonight at a Pre-Screening at Paramount Pictures tonight in Hollywood. This film will not be relased until Dec 21, 20011 - but I was quite surprised as it was directed by Steven Spielberg himself. His FIRST animated feature as the director (and producer).Along with co-producer Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings, Kink Kong) and written by Stephen Moffet (Doctor Who, Sherlock), this film stars the voice talents of Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings, 13 Going on 30, King Kong (2008), Rise of the Planet of the Apes) as the extremely inebriated Captain Haddock who inadvertantly is guided on a massive treasure hunt invlving a sunken ship of his ancestry by the young reporter Tintin - voiced by Jamie Bell (Jane Eyrie, Jumper, Defiance). Accompaied by the most inteligent and funniest sidekick I've seen since Snoopy himself - a faithful fox terrier named Snowy, everyone in this film needs to stay one step ahead of the evil villian who is artfully voiced by the talents Daniel Craig (007, Cowboys and Aliens, Defiance).Overall the movie started a little slow for me, but toward the middle it becomes a romp of fun, comedy and adventure - with quick cuts, many near misses and a whirlwind of physical hapenstnaces that only a true animated hero could survive. Accompanied by a brilliant score who was composed by Spielberg's long time parnter, John Williams (Star Wars, Jaw, Schindler's List, E.T. Close Encounters, Saving Private Ryan) - which may have sounded a little too much like the Indiana Jones themes for me (but that is what this movie is - an animated Indiana Jones) - this movie is definately family fun for all.

After The Muppets were successfully brought back last fall I wondered if Tintin would be done the same justice. I was skeptical and missed this film during it's theatrical run. After deciding to pick it up on Blu-Ray I can wholeheartedly say that The Adventures of Tintin didn't disappointment and took me back to those summer days of watching the old cartoon series.For starters, the performances and direction in this film are stellar. The voice work of Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, and Daniel Craig are excellent and they give breath and life to these characters. They've believable and instantly connect with you as soon as they appear on screen. The motion capture is perfect and the voices flawlessly match up with the action in every sequence. Though it's computer animated and the situations themselves are somewhat unbelievable, there's still a sense of verisimilitude that draws you in and makes the world these characters inhabit a bit more personal and realistic. The story moves quickly and I was amazed at how much time flew when watching this film. It clocks in at an hour and forty-six minutes, yet it feels much shorter because of the pacing. Sometimes that kind of quick pacing and constant jumping around can hurt a film but in the case of Tintin it works in the film's favor. From the opening street chase to a battle aboard a ship to a thrilling motorcycle chase, every scene flows together and each one feels tight and necessary.Having John Williams do the soundtrack was a great idea and it's another solid score from the man whose music perfectly incapsulates adventure and intrigue. The fact that Peter Jackson produced and Steven Spielberg directed makes for a perfect duo and I can't imagine another other team being able to pull this kind of project off. Their enthusiasm and passion for the genre and source material is evident in every frame. It's great to see a film that families can enjoy together. Don't get me wrong, I love dark and gritty films, but sometimes it's just refreshing to see a movie that relies on great characters, an engaging story, and fun set pieces in place of artsy styles, violence, and f-bombs.The Adventures of a Tintin is a breath of fresh air and the news that a sequel is in the works has me excited. This is a film that warrants not just its own sequel but it's own franchise. The comics leave plenty of material to draw from and Tintin is a great character that has room to grow. This film made me smile and brought me back to my childhood. It's upbeat, fun, beautiful to look at, and safe enough for kids while being smart enough for adults.

I would say this (as one would expect) is amazing work by Steven Spielberg, but arguably not his best2.

(The young adult crowd should without hesitation be able to hear Daniel Craig, Pegg and Frost!)3. As others have mentioned, the movie plot blends classic Tintin stories into one master plot and the writing was tastefully and most importantly seamlessly done4. The CGI can be quite magical, especially scenes that are zoom in/ out of either positive or negative space onto the next chapter.5. What one might find disappointing with the CGI will quickly be forgotten with all the fine details in scenes much like the original Tintin series6.

1323683,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B0034G4P4O,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","Wow! Now this was a real adventure! Old school meets newest school - and perhaps the penultimate achievement of CGI to date.I had so much fun screening this incredible production that it's difficult to compress into a short review. Obviously, others will likely do a plot synopsis and character breakdown, so I'll limit this to just my feelings and observations about Director Steven Speilberg.This seems to me the pinnacle of Speilberg's visions - having finally found the one medium that can truly express his artistic endeavors, his passion for adventure and drama; of reverent history and fond remembrance. While he'll always be remembered for his live-action films, and who can forget Jaws, Saving Private Ryan, The Color Purple, etc; in my opinion it will be his magic with children's stories that will perpetuate his long-term legacy. This film should, at least in my eyes, be the grand capstone to his incredible career.I'm so charged right now it's difficult to write! &lt;laughing> ;-DSuffice to say, this is what I've always believed CGI could accomplish when a competent guiding hand is on the steering wheel. This stunning film is what I suspect Zemeckis' syrupy sentimental 'Polar Express' and Cameron's infantile and ridiculously preachy 'Avatar' was attempting.And proof that, if done correctly, computers can achieve something truly magical.I can't wait for the next chapter! Will happily pay my admission years in advance for another Tintin Adventure.Personal Notes:- Loved that there were shades of both 'Indy' in the soundtrack and the use of blended scene cuts - awesome!- Jazzed when his shooting star signature got worked into the story. &lt;g>- Was completely floored when I saw, for the very first time last night, that the Laurel & Hardy of our times - Nick Frost and Simon Pegg - were in the movie! Holy smokes! &lt;laughing hard> X-D- Have to admit at being surprised that the filmmakers utilized ""Tin-Tin"" and not the phonetically correct Belgian of ""Tahn-Tahn"".

1323684,A17NVM7IAPF2NS,B0034G4P4O,Maek,"[7, 8]","As a half-Belgian, I grew up on Herge's work of Tintin and loved it immensely.  I still have the books that I originally collected back in the 80's.  About a year ago, I began reading the Tintin books to my own daughter who has been completely hooked.  Then, we learned that Spielberg/Jackson were heading up the effort to bring this to the silver screen.So, when I heard that Spielberg and Jackson were on the job, I felt that the project was on track to begin with (Spielberg having bought rights to make the movie back in 1984!).  After having seen it, I couldn't imagine how much better a Tintin movie might have played out, nor who could have played the characters better.  Everyone was perfectly chosen and no one felt out of place...ever.For those of you unfamiliar with Tintin, what are you in for?  Well, to sum it up briefly, Tintin is a young, intrepid reporter who has an insatiable thirst for adventure and need to solve mysteries along with his white, wily dog Snowy (or ""Milou"" in the original Belgian version) who is never far away from his master's side.  Other characters in Tintin's universe include the bumbling detectives, Thompson and Thomson (one with a ""p"", the other without).  Captain Haddock, from the original comic series, is a hopeless drunk ready with a quick lash of his nonsensical oaths (""blistering blue barnacles and ten thousand thundering typhoons!"") and even quicker with a bottle of whiskey, often to amusing effect.*minor spoilers in the next paragraph*In this movie, Tintin comes across an exquisite replica of a 16th Century ship called the Unicorn.  Straight off the bat, the ship is sought after by multiple men who try to relieve Tintin of his purchase at a flea market with cash.  Sure enough, Tintin soon becomes embroiled in a mystery that has been buried in the past regarding the ship's secret cargo.  The nature of this mystery has supposedly been passed down through to the last surviving heir who happens to be Haddock himself.  What follows is a race to decode a cryptic message left in the boat in Tintin's possession.  It's a breakneck, fantastic adventure involving danger on high seas, a fantastic aerial sequence, deserts, Moroccan palaces, and Europe itself (albeit a fairly non-descript one that suggests that Tintin is of English origin) ultimately culminating in solving the riddle behind the Unicorn and a revelation of Haddock's past.For those of you who are familiar with Tintin already, how is the treatment of the source material?  I would say that it's fairly decent although bringing such a story to the silver screen does require changes.  The movie touches on elements of the ""Secret Of The Unicorn,"" ""Red Rackham's Treasure,"" and ""The Crab With The Golden Claws.""  For the sake of brevity, the pace of the story and the whole Calculus/submarine storyline were abandoned in favor of a plot that moves very quickly.  However, elements that closely parallel the original stories (including the moment where Tintin hilariously interrupts Haddock who attempts to incorporate a swig of whiskey during a historical flashback), are handled with exquisitely painstaking detail and you can tell that Tintin afficianados were involved from start-to-finish; this is not a mere cash-grab.  In fact, the opening credits feature a vignette that is reminiscent of Herge's original artwork.  Also, a quick look around Tintin's apartment shows newspaper articles that depict many of his other adventures from other books.  Other touches include a cameo from Herge himself (who has been dead since 1983) as he sketches up Tintin at the flea market, revealing a portrait that is a perfect replica of Tintin from the comics.  For a true Tintin nostalgic fan, all of these touches are brief, but a delightful nod for those of us who remember.As for the motion capture and rendering of the movie itself?  Simply astounding.  I always thought that Polar Express was beautiful, but there was something about the characters' eyes that gave me the ""is there anyone in there"" sensation.  In this movie, however, everyone looks very much alive and the eyes really betray the emotions of how everyone is feeling.  Even the detail of Haddock's spray of explosive saliva as he grates, ""No one takes my SHIP!"" is a jaw-dropping experience.  The ocean water looks extremely real and it's hard to believe that I'm watching an animated feature most of the time.  The 3D effects - for those of you who are into it - are really done quite well, but I know that it's not everyone's cup of tea.  However, the luminosity issues that plague most 3D movies don't hurt Tintin noticeably; even dark scenes provide extremely good contrast for a great viewing experience.  Colors are extremely vibrant and pop even with the 3D glasses.  The 2D version looks just as good without the 3D effect...yes, I've seen it twice - I told you that I'm a fan.As for parents, I would say not to take the PG rating too lightly.  Haddock is a drunk, so there is consumption of alcohol but often to humorous effect; however, if that sort of thing offends you, you've been warned.  The bad guys also have no qualms at shooting at Tintin, Haddock, and Snowy either...although our trio is not afraid to dish it back either.  There is very little blood, but a character does die revealing a blood-spattered newspaper (not excessive, but enough to give you the idea that the fellow isn't doing too well).  I took my 8-year old daughter to go see it and she handled it just fine; a lot of the same elements that you see in the movie are in the books as well, so she was already prepared for everything that she was about to see.I applaud Spielberg for his work on this film.  It certainly threw me back 30 years to my own childhood and I enjoyed the movie immensely.  The ending of the movie certainly suggest that more could be on the horizon.  My only fear, however, is that despite having sold 350 million books, Herge's work is not as widely known in the United States...I can only hope that it does well enough as well as it has overseas thus far to warrant another release.  My daughter and I will eagerly be in that line should it ever occur.",5,Superb!,1324425600,"12 21, 2011",2011,6154,"['half-Belgian', 'grew', 'up', 'Herge', 'work', 'Tintin', 'loved', 'immensely',

Whenever I think about Tintin I can still hear the ridiculously overdramatised narrator's voice from forty years ago, asking whehter our heroes will meet some dreadful fate and telling the listener to find out next week on ""Herge's Adventures of Tintin!""In a nice touch, this superb example of modern animation starts with a nod to the original comics and TV cartoons as Tintin, whose face is at first out of shot, is walking in the market and a street artist offers to draw a cartoon of him. We see first the cartoon, which looks just like the Herge cartoons, and then the modern animation of Tintin as it is handed to him.This film is apparently based on three of the favourite Tintin stories: ""The Secret of the Unicorn (Adventures of Tintin),"" ""Red Rackham's Treasure (Adventures of Tintin),"" and ""The Crab with the Golden Claws (Adventures of Tintin).""It features the indomitable boy reporter, his dog snowy, Captain Haddock, and the bumbling policemen Thompson and Thomson.Just like the original this film is preposterous but highly entertaining escapist fantasy and was both amusing and exciting: both Tintin and the bad guys regularly achieve the impossible, but it is very easy to suspend disbelief while you're watching the film and just enjoy it.Quality of the animation was very high indeed and in places you could almost have been watching something real.A very high-powered voice cast brought out the voices beautifully and sounded very like the original TV series.A treat for present day kids and ""big kids"" reliving their childhood alike.",5,Brilliantly animated re-creation of the children's classic,1344038400,"08 4, 2012",2012,1964,"['review', 'based', 'having', 'watched', 'film', 'home', 'Blu-ray', 'family.Although', 'was', 'never', 'huge', 'fan', 'comics', 'child', 'remember', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'watching', 'TV', 'cartoon', 'adventures', 'divided', 'short', 'episodes', 'always', 'seemed', 'finish', 'Tintin', 'friends', 'apparently', 'get', 'shot', 'blown', 'up', 'drowned', 'only', 'miraculously', 'escape', 'start', 'next', 'episode', 'Whenever', 'think', 'Tintin', 'can', 'still', 'hear', 'ridiculously', 'overdramatised', 'narrator', 'voice', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'asking', 'whehter', 'heroes', 'will', 'meet', 'dreadful', 'fate', 'telling', 'listener', 'find', 'out', 'next', 'week', 'Herge', 'Adventures', 'Tintin', 'nice', 'touch', 'superb', 'example', 'modern', 'animation', 'nod', 'original', 'comics', 'TV', 'cartoons', 'Tintin', 'face', 'first', 'shot', 'walking', 'market', 'street', 'artist', 'offers', 'draw', 'cartoon', 'see', 'first', 'cartoon', 'just', 'Herge', 'cartoons', 'then', 'modern', 'animation', 'Tintin', 'handed', 'him.This', 'film', 'apparently', 'based', 'three', 'favourite', 'Tintin', 'stories', 'Secret', 'Unicorn', 'Adventures', 'Tintin', 'Red', 'Rackham', 'Treasure', 'Adventures', 'Tintin', 'Crab', 'Golden', 'Claws', 'Adventures', 'Tintin', 'indomitable', 'boy', 'reporter', 'dog', 'snowy', 'Captain', 'Haddock', 'bumbling', 'policemen', 'Thompson', 'Thomson.Just', 'original', 'film', 'preposterous', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'escapist', 'fantasy', 'was', 'amusing', 'exciting', 'Tintin', 'bad', 'guys', 'regularly', 'achieve', 'impossible', 'very', 'easy', 'suspend', 'disbelief', ""'re"", 'watching', 'film', 'just', 'enjoy', 'it.Quality', 'animation', 'was', 'very', 'high', 'indeed', 'places', 'could', 'almost', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'something', 'real.A', 'very', 'high-powered', 'voice', 'cast', 'brought', 'out', 'voices', 'beautifully', 'sounded', 'very', 'original', 'TV', 'series.A', 'treat', 'present', 'day', 'kids', 'big', 'kids', 'reliving', 'childhood', 'alike']",N/A

Spielberg acquired the rights to Tintin after creator Herge's death in 1983 but a number of issues delayed the creation of this film until now. The tale is engaging and well fitted for all ages as Tintin and his allies search for a legendary treasure trove. The clue with the scrolls was nicely done and the camera angles impressed me in adding to the tale. A few of the solutions to their jams were clever and humorous, especially the one on the plane with Captain Haddock and the lose of plane fuel. The twin detectives were more amusing than expected and the villain looked a little like Spielberg to me but I think that was just coincidence, right? Spielberg directed and Peter Jackson was one of the producers. Spielberg intended this an ""Indiana Jones for kids"" and that's about right. ""Great Snakes!"" and ""Fresh Water Politicians!"" this is one you don't want to miss, people. The $135M budget grossed over $373M at the Box Office (Wiki source).

Well sure, I've seen the movie trailers.  Initially, I was a bit put off because I couldn't figure out how old this kid is.  My son suggested he was about 15 and that's pretty much the way the character acted and looked.  Then, he heads back to his bachelor pad, straps on a Ruger 9 mm and heads out looking for the crooks that stole his model ship.  He even heads out to sea after being captured and manages to dispatch numerous henchmen with the boxing skills of Manny Pacquiao.  I guess he's a bit older.  In any case director Steven Spielberg, in his first animated film, resurrects what appears to be Young Indiana Jones.Tintin purchases a model 3-masted sailing ship at a flea market unaware that sealed inside one of the masts is a map that leads to a great treasure.  This early part of the film wants to be witty and I wish it were.  Where are all those inside jokes that keep the adults interested?  The movie jumps to a full gallop and never lets up for the next hour or more.  Tintin, with the help of his trusted pooch Snowy, manage to figure things out.  Aboard the ship, Tintin frees the captain who is the grandson of the original sailing ship's captain.  The ship (Unicorn)  sunk loaded with gold and other treasures.  In reflection the ship was sunk after a great battle with a pirate named Sakharine.  He was the grandfather of the thief (Rackham) who took Tintin's model ship.  Each of the 3 model ships that were built by grandpa Haddock contains clues to the treasure location.  The chase is on.  And it's quite a chase.  The action is exhausting.The movie uses motion capture and is very well done.  Excellent voice acting helps as well.  Jamie Bell is Tintin, Daniel Craig is the evil Rackham/Sakharine and talented Andy Serkis is the Captains Haddock.  I saw this film in 3-D and it is subtle and very effective.  This is a close second to the 3-D version of ""Hugo"" in terms of technical effectiveness.  I would also note that I saw this in a theater filled with kids who can often be fidgety and noisy, but there wasn't a peep.

The detailing is perfect, I noted that I could see characters` individual hairs being blown by breezes during scenes. The characters themselves were depicted with an almost surrealistic blend of realism mixed with exaggerated facial details that added a comic book effect while giving you an almost photographic reality in an animated world.(I`ve already pre-ordered the Blu Ray)Now, all that was fun... here is where the 'wonder' from my title comes in...Seeing this movie makes me wonder why Stephen Spielberg makes us wait for years upon years to see another live-action 'Indiana Jones' adventure with an ever-aging Harrison Ford ?There could just as easily be new Indiana Jones adventures--with 'Indy' in his prime--voiced by Ford with graphics such as found here. Granted, the location fiming in the Indiana Jones movies was a vital aspect of them, but it strikes me that the character and the adventures count for a bit more (otherwise it`s just a glorified travelogue).If the sort of 'Hyper-Reality' found in TINTIN can be created, then why not apply the tech to characters such as Indiana Jones ? I would certainly be willing to pay to see Indy in action, looking good again, in his 30`s or 40`s..back in the 30`s or 40`s... rather than wonder if Spielberg, Lucas & Ford are going to get around to making one more movie before Ford gets too far past the believability point in years for an 'action/adventure' character.Makes me wonder....But, I digress...Give TINTIN a try.

Over the years there have been a number of attempts to bring the comics to the screen, and the cartoon series that appeared on HBO a number of years ago did a pretty great job of it, in my opinion, staying true to the origins of the Tintin comics. When I heard that none other than Steven Spielberg and Steve Jackson were planning to make a Tintin movie, I was very excited. Then I saw the trailer in the theatre last year, and I have to admit I cringed a bit. This did not feel like the ""original"" Tintin I grew up with. But I finally gave in this past weekend and went to see the movie in the theatre.""The Adventures of Tintin"" (107 min.) is not a live action movie nor is it a cartoon, but instead somewhere in the middle, an animated movie using live actors in the filming who then get ""digitized"" for the final result. Why, oh why? As I watched the movie, as entertaining as it was at times, I kept thinking to myself it felt ""fake"". I simply do not understand why Spielberg didn't chose to make this a live action movie, as the movie feels pretty much a cross between ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Pirates of the Carribean"". Not that the movie is bad, but it could've been so much better. The highlight of the movie is actually the opening credits, where we see the cartoon Tintin and his dog Snowy dodge a number of dangerous situations (not unlike, say, the opening cartoon credits of the Peter Sellers-era Pink Panther movies), just tremedous. The movie did do just okay but not great in the US, although it earned bunches more in overseas markets. Peter Jackson supposedly will direct the next Tintin movie (if there is one).As an aside, the movie's plot is based on 3 Tintin books originally published in the 1940s, The Crab with the Golden Claws (1941), The Secret of the Unicorn (1943), and Red Rackham's Treasure (1944). I reread those comics the other day, and frankly, they are tons better than the movie. I bought most of the Tintin books in English for my kids when they were younger, and they loved them too.

The only reason this movie gets 3 stars, is for the animation, not the story. If I was rating on story alone, this would get only 2 stars.I will say, apparently this movie is based upon a book series, which I have not read. So I can't compare it to the books.The story follows a young reporter on his quest to uncover the story behind what happened on a ship, starting with his purchase of a model ship of the same name at a street market. And his adventure begins, with his faithful dog as companion/side-kick.First, the animation is incredible, the eyes, the hands, the hair, clouds, relfection in the water, action sequences, etc. In fact, the animation is so good, you can hardly tell at times it is animated, which is amazing. The directing is incredible as well, particularly with the action sequences.Where this movie fell short for me, is in the story department. I simply was not capitvated by Tin Tin, or his adventure, and I should have been. Present me with a ""hero"", reluctant is better, present him with a challenge or obstacle, and proceed to kick his butt, while I spend my time rooting for him to win and come out on top.Obviously, this movie had quite a budget for animation. But it lacked the same attention, focus, and follow through in the story's foundation.You can spend millions and make the most beautiful movie in the world.

A friend has a new 3D Tv and 3D Blueray, so I thought I'd buy this for a Tv-warming present.  I had no idea how well-made this movie was -- the characterizations were phenomenal from Andy Sirkis as Capt. Haddock, Daniel Craig as the villain and Jamie Bell as Tin Tin.  My Gawd!  The animation was so superb and intricate--you could see droplets of water blowing away on the portholes, each hair moving in the wind, the haircut lines, the ocean waves, all of it no detail unturned.  Then there's the storyline, which was complicated and adult for a ""children's"" movie.  My friend, who grew up in the movie business (his father, aunts and uncles were film cutters in the 30's through the 60's), generally has very little truck with bad movies (he generally falls asleep through them or he's always pointing a boom shadow or a bad film match -- always ANNOYING!).  He actually stayed awake and exclaimed that the animation had to be incorporated into real-life backdrops (something akin Dick Van Dyke dancing with penguins)...but it's not-- it's all computer animation and fantastic!  The atmosphere of the movie and the adventures may make you think of Indiana Jones--but, frankly, it's so much better!

Sure it has the power to tempt you with its big lettuce and cheese and tomatoes and it's juicy patty... But even despite the yumminess of the burger, it's a dull experience overall as you've devoured nothing of actual substance.I'll admit, for the first thirty minutes of Tintin, I was hooked. I hadn't read a single comic book, watched a single cartoon or even encounter a piece of literature that bore the name ""Tintin"" as a child, so this was all new experience to me. Unfortunately, the fun only lasted for thirty minutes. About two hours later, I left the cinema not only feeling dazed from all the 3D effects and always moving camera shots, but also wondering why they even bothered to try to make CG animated film out of something that clearly looked as if it wasn't meant to be a film.Don't get me wrong guys. I don't mean any disrespect to Stevie S, as he is a fantastic filmmaker and has made dozens of fantastic films throughout his career. But frankly, Tintin was just... Boring.I think the biggest problem lies in its protagonist. Tintin is a very empty character and almost a Gary Stu. Everything seems to go exactly as planned for him and he seems to have no weaknesses or defaults. I'll remind you yet again that I didn't know anything about Tintin before going in, so I'm not sure if I missed the point of anything but really... He was just a dull character, and not interesting enough to warrant an entire movie based around him.It really is a shame because Haddock, his partner was a fun and quirky character, and kept me watching. And the spine tingling chillingness of Daniel Craig's Saccharine was just mesmerizing, gorgeous to watch even and how he played the evil character nicely. So... Couldn't the movie's own damned protagonist do anything to show he's worthy of a movie?I also don't know of this is just me, but I could tell the writers were trying to force too many eggs into one basket. I have no idea what stories this takes inspiration from but I just feel like this was just a bunch of stories mashed together with no cohesion.However, at least it looked pretty. At least it gave me something to look at when I wasn't trying to wrap my head around the not very interesting story, or how many of those there were. Alas, this is a film I could see myself putting on at parties as a background type thing, you know? But if I were to try and sit through the film again, I'd have a headache from it all. So I guess my review should be a 3/10... But it did look pretty, so I'll give it a 5. For one it could have been a lot worse.Hey, for one, we could have gotten another ""Immortals"" with this one.

I used to watch the Nelvana cartoon with my family back in the 90's and I never missed one single episode of it!! Besides, that's the TV series that introduced me to the character.Having grown up with the series, at that time I had no idea that it was inspired on a series of comics written by Belgian writer George Remi (Herg&eacute;), so when Internet finally came in the late 90's I started to search for those comics, and boy, I had a hell of a thrill ride!With that said, needless to say that I was eagerly waiting for this movie! Of course there is some other movie adaptations out there, but truth being told, they never made much justice to the supreme creation of Herg&eacute;.By the way, Herg&eacute; used to say that the only person alive capable of taking his creation to the big screen was Steven Spielberg. And boy, he was 100% right!!This first adaptation of the Tintin adventures around the world is brilliant!! More than brilliant!! It's perfect!! Seriously, the only thing more perfect than this would be if Spielberg copied the entire stories from the comics to the form of a movie. And don't get me wrong, he did keep the original story by Herg&eacute; almost intact in this movie, but being the great filmmakers that he and Peter Jackson are, they decided to have a take on more than one story per movie and put those stories to work together as a whole. Did it work? Oh yeah!In this first movie of a hopeful long series of movies (Herg&eacute; made 24 Tintin stories!!) they decide to introduce us to the characters. They introduce to the Tintin rookies the main character, the reporter Tintin and his dog Milou, who are two courageous fellas who are always ready for adventure. We also manage to meet the Dupont twins on this movie, two silly and dumb police officers and Captain Haddock, the longtime friend of the main character. Even the Moulinsart Castle and the lovely Bianca Castafiore was there.The stories chosen to this movie was ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"" (where Tintin and Haddock met for the first time), ""The Secret of the Unicorn"" and ""The Red Rackham's Treasure"", three of the most exciting stories of the Tintin collection.The animation is fantastic, fluent and the digital sets take your breath away. The acting is superb, they got the right cast to act, Andy Serkis as Haddock is spectacular!! And that's another strong point in the movie, the characterization of almost every character on Tintin's universe was kept intact, except for Dr. Sakharin, who in the original stories was never a descendant from Red Rackham, but it was a nice addition and brought more drama and interesting developments to the script.The humor is top notch!! I laughed out loud with the drunk jokes in the movie, in fact, I laughed out loud in the entire movie!! It was fantastic!! Being able to see all those beloved characters from my youth in the big screen exactly the way I used to know them was just great!!As for the story, well it's the story everyone as a fan already know. It was the same story we know from the comics and the Nelvana cartoon, but told differently, so, except for the Sakharin development, there was no surprises at all for me in terms of story.The only character I missed on the movie was Professor Tryphon Tournesol. I just love this scientist. He is deaf, but doesn't know it, so he gets everything wrong and usually causes a lot of trouble, but he have a heart of gold. I was eagerly hoping to see Prof. Tournesol on the movie with his shark submarine, but I guess I'll have to wait for the next one.And boy, I will be eagerly waiting for the next one, the one Peter Jackson will direct. I seriously hope to see more Tintin movies from now on. I'm also really sad that the film went so bad in the USA, I guess US people didn't get the point of Tintin, but I hope they will next time.Anyway, great movie, wonderful adaptation, I hope to see more of this, and I will finish my review by saying: Great Snakes and Blistering Barnacles!!

characters themselves are slightly exaggerated so one doesn't forget that this is just animation,when circumstances on screen get too""real"" or not.Herge's creation has been around for years,being Belgian born and raised,and first hitting the media in the late 20s.Now Spielberg and company have gotten control of Herge's creation and come up with this new animated movie,full of excitement,comedy and adventure.And I believe Tin Tin is in good hands here.The plot involves Tin Tin,a Thin Man/Indiana Jones combo young man,and his faithful wire haired terrier Snowflake.He acquires a model ship at a flea market and from there his troubles start.It seems other agents want that ship too.It contains a scroll in one of the masts,one of three,that someone needs to complete a bigger puzzle,leading to a kings ransom.Tin Tin is captured and taken on board a ship.He meets up with Capt.Haddock,a drunk whose ship Tin Tin's captors have taken control of.When they reach land in Morocco they find another model ship owned by a Shiek and it is then Capt.Haddock relates the tale of his ancestor who captained the original ship the models are based on.It was his ancestor who had to purposely scuttle his own ship and only he and his descendants know the exact location of the treasure,everyone now seeks.The rest of the film is taken up trying to outwit and survive the onslaughts of those that would seek the treasure and kill Tin Tin,Snowy and Capt.Haddock.Will the adventuresome trio succeed?There is no doubt the ending was as spectacular as the events leading up to it.The sense of humour and twists and turns never abate throughout the film,which leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat awaiting what will happen next.It is not too many animated films that can generate this kind of excitement and interest,but this one does in spades.The only drawback I found was with the length and intricacy of the plot.While it may be fine for the older set,the younger ones tend to squirm in their seats.I know,having taken my grandchildren to its premiere and sitting in an audience full of children.Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp and in a 1:85:1 w/s a/r.Extras include featurettes on the making of Tin Tin and one on Snowy.All in all a highly recommended film for the whole family,filled with lots of exciting adventures and humour which will keep you on the edge of your seats from beginning to end.The length and plot twists and turns will have your younger ones turning into squirmers.Listen for the voice talents of Daniel Craig,Nick Frost,Simon Pegg,Andy

1323747,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0034G4P4O,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","The Adventures of Tintin (Steven Spielberg, 2011)I have to admit, I was really, really expecting to not like this movie. I can count the number of Spielberg-directed efforts I'd be willing to watch again on one hand, Tintin has never really adapted all that well to the big screen (I've seen at least half a dozen attempts, none of them completely successful), Spielberg hasn't delved into the PG world for over two decades (his last PG-rated film was 1991's Hook) and Peter Jackson never has. And honest to Ritz crackers, of all the people you could have cast as Tintin... Jamie freakin' Bell? Billy Elliott, for pete's sake? Why does this kid even have a career after Jumper?And yet, somehow, I am amazed to tell you, it all works. I'll put it this way: my fifteen-month-old son barely has the attention span to watch a ten-minute episode of Moomins or Curious George, but I put The Adventures of Tintin on this morning and he sat in his high chair riveted to the screen the entire movie. And you know what? So was I, well without the high chair. Everything that should have been irredeemably wrong about this movie somehow works.If you're familiar with Herg&eacute;'s series of Tintin comics, The Adventures of Tintin is a (loose) adaptation of The Secret of the Unicorn, with a very abbreviated version of Red Rackham's Treasure in the last fifteen minutes. If you're not, the plot: Tintin (Bell) is an award-winning Belgian reporter between the World Wars. He and his faithful dog Snowy are wandering aimlessly through a flea market one afternoon when they chance upon a beautiful triple-masted model ship. Tintin buys it for a pound and is immediately accosted by two men in succession who want to buy it from him for dozens of times more than he paid for it. Obviously, there's something special about this ship. After Snowy accidentally knocks the ship over, Tintin finds a miniature scroll hidden in the mainmast&#8212;and soon finds that Professor Sakharine (Craig. Daniel Craig.), one of the men who had attempted to buy the ship from him earlier in the day, has an exact replica. With, presumably, another scroll. Thus begins a globetrotting game of cat and mouse, as the two attempt to wrest each other's scrolls away.Now, I'm one of those people who thinks that this motion-capture form of animation that's gotten so big recently is just downright creepy-looking, which was another thing the movie had against it in my head before I started, but ten minutes in I had almost forgotten I wasn't watching a live-action film (save Snowy, who's always pretty obviously a CGI creation). The characters are expressive and just shy of realistic, almost all of them very well-voiced&#8212;and delivering great lines thanks partly to Herg&eacute; and partly to screenwriting team Steven Moffat (Coupling) and Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead), who are obviously familiar with the series and inserted references to a number of other Tintin adventures (The Crab with the Golden Claws, Explorers on the Moon, The Land of Black Gold, and many more). Spielberg has always been good at action sequences (and that handful of his films I'd be willing to watch again all turn on distinctive ones&#8212;1941, Duel, Saving Private Ryan), and he delivers some solid ones here, especially in the film's climax. This is excellent stuff all around. It would have been very nice to see them draw it out another twenty minutes or so and work in at least a little more of the actual Red Rackham's Treasure storyline, but you can't have everything. ****",4,The best screen adaptation of Tintin to date.,1362096000,"03 1, 2013",2013,3537,"['Adventures', 'Tintin', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', '2011', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'really', 'really', 'expecting', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'can', 'count', 'number', 'Spielberg-directed', 'efforts', ""'d"", 'be', 'willing', 'watch', 'again', 'one', 'hand', 'Tintin', 'never', 'really', 'adapted', 'well', 'big', 'screen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'least', 'dozen', 'attempts', 'none', 'completely', 'successful', 'Spielberg', ""n't"", 'delved', 'PG', 'world', 'two', 'decades', 'last', 'PG-rated', 'film', 'was', '1991', 'Hook', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'never', 'honest', 'Ritz', 'crackers', 'people', 'could', 'have', 'cast', 'Tintin', 'Jamie', 'freakin', 'Bell', 'Billy', 'Elliott', 'pete', 'sake', 'Why', 'kid', 'even', 'have', 'career', 'Jumper', 'yet', 'somehow', 'am', 'amazed', 'tell', ""'ll"", 'put', 'way', 'fifteen-month-old', 'son', 'barely', 'attention', 'span', 'watch', 'ten-minute', 'episode', 'Moomins', 'Curious', 'George', 'put', 'Adventures', 'Tintin', 'morning', 'sat', 'high', 'chair', 'riveted', 'screen', 'entire', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'So', 'was', 'well', 'high', 'chair', 'Everything', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'irredeemably', 'wrong', 'movie', 'somehow', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'Herg', 'eacute', 'series', 'Tintin', 'comics', 'Adventures', 'Tintin', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'Secret', 'Unicorn', 'very', 'abbreviated', 'version', 'Red', 'Rackham', 'Treasure', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', ""'re"", 'not', 'plot', 'Tintin', 'Bell', 'award-winning', 'Belgian', 'reporter', 'World', 'Wars', 'faithful', 'dog', 'Snowy', 'are', 'wandering', 'aimlessly', 'flea', 'market', 'one', 'afternoon', 'when', 'chance', 'beautiful', 'triple-masted', 'model', 'ship', 'Tintin', 'pound', 'immediately', 'accosted', 'two', 'men', 'succession', 'who', 'want', 'buy', 'dozens', 'times', 'more', 'paid', 'Obviously', 'something', 'special', 'ship', 'Snowy', 'accidentally', 'ship', 'Tintin', 'miniature', 'scroll', 'hidden', 'mainmast', '8212', 'soon', 'finds', 'Professor', 'Sakharine', 'Craig', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'one', 'men', 'who', 'had', 'attempted', 'buy', 'ship', 'earlier', 'day', 'exact', 'replica', 'presumably', 'scroll', 'Thus', 'globetrotting', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'two', 'attempt', 'wrest', 'other', 'scrolls', 'away.Now', ""'m"", 'one', 'people', 'who', 'motion-capture', 'form', 'animation', 'gotten', 'so', 'big', 'recently', 'just', 'downright', 'creepy-looking', 'was', 'thing', 'movie', 'had', 'head', 'started', 'ten', 'minutes', 'had', 'almost', 'forgotten', 'was', ""n't"", 'watching', 'live-action', 'film', 'save', 'Snowy', 'who', 'always', 'pretty', 'obviously', 'CGI', 'creation', 'characters', 'are', 'expressive', 'just', 'shy', 'realistic', 'almost', 'very', 'well-voiced', '8212', 'delivering', 'great', 'lines', 'thanks', 'partly', 'Herg', 'eacute', 'partly', 'screenwriting', 'team', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'Coupling', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'who', 'are', 'obviously', 'familiar', 'series', 'inserted', 'references', 'number', 'other', 'Tintin', 'adventures', 'Crab', 'Golden', 'Claws', 'Explorers', 'Moon', 'Land', 'Black', 'Gold', 'many', 'more', 'Spielberg', 'always', 'been', 'good', 'action', 'sequences', 'handful', 'films', ""'d"", 'be', 'willing', 'watch', 'again', 'turn', 'distinctive', 'ones', '8212', '1941', 'Duel', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'solid', 'ones', 'here', 'especially', 'film', 'climax', 'excellent', 'stuff', 'around', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'nice', 'see', 'draw', 'out', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'work', 'least', 'little', 'more', 'actual', 'Red', 'Rackham', 'Treasure', 'storyline', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'everything', '****']",N/A

The film follows The Secret of the Unicorn closely, but makes a number of small plot changes - I mention this because aficionados of the books will have memorized every single scene.  The changes do not detract from the story.The characterizations are pretty good, though Tintin's face is often curiously devoid of emotion.  As the adventure moves quickly, the viewer can forget about Tintin's lack of character, but it was an occasional annoyance.  Haddock is much better:  the film definitely captures his essential mix of buffoonery, courage, and purity of spirit; he is very funny, always the more delightful character than the ernest and wholesome Tintin, so perhaps that is why he has more life to him.  The other characters are also more vividly drawn than Tintin, from Thompson and Thompson to the many bad guys like Red Rackam.  For the most part, the animation, atmosphere, and action are spectacular, so clear as to be indistinguishable from film.My kids enjoyed this as much as I did.

1323786,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B0034G4P4O,Theo,"[3, 3]","I'm afraid I'm going to have to dare the ire of the fans. Because I was, it seems, less impressed by this film than most.But first, the positives: the CGI was genuinely amazing. It successfully bestrode an intriguing middle ground between the cartoonish and something very, very close to photo-realism. From the waves on the ocean to the expressions on the characters' faces, the animators were extremely successful in creating a world that is solid, real, and compelling. It most definitely draws us in.It is, as stated, more Spielberg than Herg&eacute;. The quiet, the stillness, and above all the restraint that were such hallmarks of Herg&eacute;'s work are nowhere to be found. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing. Filmic interpretations do not have to be slavish copies, and this one certainly wasn't. I'm sure that many fans will be quick to point out that this is a film that almost constantly pays homage to the visual side of Herg&eacute;'s work - particularly in some of its most iconic and best loved panels. And it's true: the film does do precisely that. However, the similarities are all on the surface. For those who look deeper, and compare this film's intricacy of detail, and above all its relentless, ceaseless motion with the minimalism of Herg&eacute;'s famous ""ligne claire"" style, it is at once apparent that at a certain point Spielberg made the choice to go his own way. Indeed, the film tacitly admits as much at the very beginning, when this movie's ""Tintin"" has his portrait drawn by an artist at a market stall. The artist closely resembles Herg&eacute;, and the drawing the original vision of Tintin. We are being politely but firmly told that this will be a film that respects the original, but does not feel so beholden to it as to be nothing more than a carbon copy.The true artist must have scope for interpretation.This film also gave us not just one but two stand-out performances. Jamie Bell, in the titular role of Tintin, and Daniel Craig as both Sakharine and Red Rackham. Each actor brings a level of reality to their characters rarely to be found in animated features. This fits perfectly with the film's visual approach: it's that whole ""intriguing middle ground"" between the cartoonish and the photo-real that I spoke of earlier.I was less impressed with Andy Serkis's performance as Captain Haddock, which was certainly more overtly cartoonish, and just plain less interesting. But it is worth stating that some of the minor characters were exceptionally well rendered, and very much in the spirit of Herg&eacute;'s original versions. I'm thinking here particularly of the pickpocket, played by Toby Jones, and a two-bit thug by the name of Tom, played by Mackenzie Crook. I'd like to think that Herg&eacute; himself would've approved of both these performances.Yet despite all the good stuff, I did feel that from a grown-up perspective, this movie let itself down in the writing. Particularly in terms of pacing, it's more like a bad Indiana Jones movie than anything else. Certainly so far as depth of characterisation goes, all the heavy lifting is done by the actors and the animators. The writers contribute almost nothing. The main problem is that after a promising start, the film rapidly degenerates into little more than one long action sequence, with only very brief, unconvincing, and ultimately uninteresting pauses along the way. At times the relentless action seems to exist as little more than a showcase for the animators' virtuosity. And as outstanding as the animation is, technical brilliance for its own sake does not a good film make.Earlier I spoke of Herg&eacute;'s work as possessing a certain restraint. Indeed, I would even go so far as to say that I consider that restraint one of its defining stylistic features. This holds true not only on a visual level, but also in terms of story. Herg&eacute; knew when to give his readers time to think. A quiet moment here and there to reflect on what had happened and let it all sink in. Such moments are, I feel, sorely lacking in this movie. This film is all about the spectacular. It's a joy to look at and is without doubt a rollicking, two-fisted rocket-ride through adventure. But it's not a whole lot more than that.Which is where, I believe, it really has let Herg&eacute;'s original vision down.Theo.",3,More Spielberg Than Herg&eacute;,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,4330,"[""'m"", 'afraid', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'dare', 'ire', 'fans', 'was', 'less', 'impressed', 'film', 'most.But', 'first', 'positives', 'CGI', 'was', 'genuinely', 'amazing', 'successfully', 'bestrode', 'intriguing', 'middle', 'ground', 'cartoonish', 'something', 'very', 'very', 'close', 'photo-realism', 'waves', 'ocean', 'expressions', 'characters', 'animators', 'were', 'extremely', 'successful', 'creating', 'world', 'solid', 'real', 'compelling', 'most', 'definitely', 'draws', 'in.It', 'stated', 'more', 'Spielberg', 'Herg', 'eacute', 'quiet', 'stillness', 'restraint', 'were', 'such', 'hallmarks', 'Herg', 'eacute', 'work', 'are', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'Filmic', 'interpretations', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'slavish', 'copies', 'one', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'film', 'almost', 'constantly', 'homage', 'visual', 'side', 'Herg', 'eacute', 'work', 'particularly', 'most', 'iconic', 'best', 'loved', 'panels', 'true', 'film', 'do', 'precisely', 'However', 'similarities', 'are', 'surface', 'who', 'look', 'deeper', 'compare', 'film', 'intricacy', 'detail', 'relentless', 'ceaseless', 'motion', 'minimalism', 'Herg', 'eacute', 'famous', 'ligne', 'claire', 'style', 'once', 'apparent', 'certain', 'point', 'Spielberg', 'made', 'choice', 'go', 'own', 'way', 'Indeed', 'film', 'tacitly', 'as', 'much', 'very', 'beginning', 'when', 'movie', 'Tintin', 'portrait', 'drawn', 'artist', 'market', 'stall', 'artist', 'closely', 'Herg', 'eacute', 'drawing', 'original', 'vision', 'Tintin', 'are', 'being', 'politely', 'firmly', 'told', 'will', 'be', 'film', 'original', 'not', 'feel', 'so', 'beholden', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'carbon', 'copy.The', 'true', 'artist', 'must', 'have', 'scope', 'interpretation.This', 'film', 'also', 'gave', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'two', 'stand-out', 'performances', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'titular', 'role', 'Tintin', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Sakharine', 'Red', 'Rackham', 'actor', 'level', 'reality', 'characters', 'rarely', 'be', 'found', 'animated', 'features', 'perfectly', 'film', 'visual', 'approach', 'whole', 'intriguing', 'middle', 'ground', 'cartoonish', 'photo-real', 'spoke', 'earlier.I', 'was', 'less', 'impressed', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'performance', 'Captain', 'Haddock', 'was', 'certainly', 'more', 'overtly', 'cartoonish', 'just', 'plain', 'less', 'interesting', 'worth', 'stating', 'minor', 'characters', 'were', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'rendered', 'very', 'much', 'spirit', 'Herg', 'eacute', 'original', 'versions', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'here', 'particularly', 'pickpocket', 'played', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'two-bit', 'thug', 'name', 'Tom', 'played', 'Mackenzie', 'Crook', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'Herg', 'eacute', 'would', ""'ve"", 'approved', 'performances.Yet', 'good', 'stuff', 'did', 'feel', 'grown-up', 'perspective', 'movie', 'let', 'down', 'writing', 'Particularly', 'terms', 'pacing', 'more', 'bad', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'movie', 'anything', 'else', 'Certainly', 'so', 'far', 'depth', 'characterisation', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'done', 'actors', 'animators', 'writers', 'contribute', 'almost', 'nothing', 'main', 'problem', 'promising', 'start', 'film', 'rapidly', 'little', 'more', 'one', 'long', 'action', 'sequence', 'only', 'very', 'brief', 'unconvincing', 'ultimately', 'uninteresting', 'pauses', 'way', 'times', 'relentless', 'action', 'exist', 'little', 'more', 'showcase', 'animators', 'virtuosity', 'as', 'outstanding', 'animation', 'technical', 'brilliance', 'own', 'sake', 'not', 'good', 'film', 'make.Earlier', 'spoke', 'Herg', 'eacute', 'work', 'possessing', 'certain', 'restraint', 'Indeed', 'would', 'even', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'consider', 'restraint', 'one', 'defining', 'stylistic', 'features', 'true', 'not', 'only', 'visual', 'level', 'also', 'terms', 'story', 'Herg', 'eacute', 'knew', 'when', 'give', 'readers', 'time', 'think', 'quiet', 'moment', 'here', 'there', 'reflect', 'had', 'happened', 'let', 'sink', 'Such', 'moments', 'are', 'feel', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'movie', 'film', 'spectacular', 'joy', 'look', 'doubt', 'rollicking', 'two-fisted', 'rocket-ride', 'adventure', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'that.Which', 'where', 'believe', 'really', 'let', 'Herg', 'eacute', 'original', 'vision', 'down.Theo']",N/A

1323792,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B0034G4P4O,Tom Birkenstock,"[6, 12]","Stephen Spielberg released The Adventures of Tintin nearly simultaneously with his other film, War Horse. The two are strike an interesting contrast with each other. Where War Horse plays the role of the classic Hollywood epic, Tintin serves as its hyperactive younger brother. Most in the Anglophone world are, at best, nominally familiar with the strangely coifed titular character, Tintin, but he's a pretty big deal among the Francophone part of the globe. My history with the character is modest, having only watched a short lived animated version on Nickelodeon when I was a kid. So I'm familiar with some of the characters, but I couldn't tell you how the movie stacks up to the source material. But the film itself is rather unruly, at times providing exciting action but also failing to tell a fully engaging story.Tintin is a boy reporter (his age is somewhat ambiguous) who has a penchant for discovering vast plots that require quite a bit of globetrotting to uncover. The film opens with Tintin buying an old model ship, a replica of the lost galleon The Unicorn, at a flea market. He snatches it up mere moments before another buyer, Mr. Sakharine, arrives to pick up the ship. Tintin rebuffs any offer from Sakharine to purchase the MacGuffin, er, ship, from Tintin at a sizeable profit. Needless to say, the model ship is more than it first appears, and in fact it comprises part of a series of clues that lead to a long ago lost treasure. Sakharine doesn't take Tintin's refusal to sell kindly, ransacking the intrepid hero's apartment and eventually kidnapping him and storing him on a large steamship. The ship's captain, Captain Haddock, has been deposed by Sakharine and the mutinous crew. Tintin and Haddock team up to stop Sakharine and discover the secret behind the fate of the Unicorn and its treasure, a secret that has familial ties to Haddock himself, since it was his grandfather who captained the Unicorn before it became lost at sea.Perhaps more so than Tintin himself, Haddock seems to be the fan favorite character. He's a bit of a drunken buffoon, and while I would imagine he wouldn't be the ideal partner for world wide adventuring, he's great fun to watch. Tintin was filmed using motion capture techniques, similar to the ones used in those Robert Zemeckis films, Beowulf and The Polar Express. This isn't my favorite kind of animation because, as others have noted, the combination of animated characters and eerily realistic movement tends to produce an uncanny valley effect. However, this technique does allow Andy Serkis to put in an enjoyably cartoonish performance in the role of Haddock. Serkis has become the go to man for motion capture performances--he's kind of a 21st century Lon Chaney--and his robust performance is a highlight of the film. He plays Haddock as a perpetually energetic man who has little control over his own drinking, downing bottles of liquor before he has a chance to even think about it. To his credit, Spielberg keeps all of the now risqu&eacute; drunkard jokes, refusing to pander to his audience. And while Haddock's alcoholism is often played for laughs, he's also chastised once or twice by Tintin, even if he never gives up the drink.Much of the film is an excuse for Spielberg to deliver one fantastic action piece after another without regard to pesky things like the laws of physics. There are some fantastic moments, including a battle between two ships during a raging storm and a crash landing in the desert. But perhaps the most thrilling part of the film is a chase through a Middle Eastern bizarre that takes place in a single, long shot. In these moments we see Spielberg eager to play with animation in ways that he can't in live action. Unfortunately, it's in the moments between the action that the movie seems unsure of itself. Like a jittery kid on a sugar rush, the movie can hardly sit still for a moment. The film is a series of action set pieces strung together with exposition as epoxy. This means that when the adventure should feel exciting, it sometimes feels exhausting. (I did see the movie in 3D, which may have only exacerbated this problem). This seems to be a problem that's worse in animated films. With the exception of Pixar, most animation studios feel the need to barrage the viewer with constant noise and unending movement, like they're shaking a pair of toy keys in front of a baby. Filmmakers need to let these films breath, to find a natural rhythm. Unfortunately, Tintin is no exception to this rule.The director and film theorist, Sergei Eisenstein wrote extensively about the concept of dialectic, the synthesis of two seemingly opposing elements. We see this in plenty of Eisenstein's films and, strictly from the point of view of entertainment, the audience is wrenched from one emotional state to another. In his most famous film, Battleship Potemkin, Eisenstein precedes the massacre on the Odessa steps with images of celebration of the arrival of the rebellious crew of the Potemkin. The contrast between celebratory citizens and the gory images of innocents being gunned down makes the film that much more compelling. Likewise, an action film, at the very least, needs moments of calm in order to further elevate the moments of gunplay and fisticuffs. Spielberg has done wonders with this kind of contrast in other films. The famous caravan chase in Raiders of the Lost Ark, for example, comes after a grueling and atmospheric descent into the Well of Souls. It's only because we have followed Indiana Jones through a pit of snakes that we are now ready to release all that built up tension by watching him slug some Nazis. These days Spielberg almost always excels when it comes to laying out the action, but he would be well served to pay as much attention to the part of the film where bullets aren't whizzing by.",3,Entertaining if ultimately forgettable,1329004800,"02 12, 2012",2012,5845,"['Stephen', 'Spielberg', 'released', 'Adventures', 'Tintin', 'nearly', 'simultaneously', 'other', 'film', 'War',

I didn't even know what hit me until after watching it.  It is even hard for me to write about TinTin.To be fair, I was lucky enough to watch it in the original 3D version on BluRay.  3D enhanced this movie into the stratospheres. I cannot say enough for how powerful the use of 3D is in this movie.  It makes a huge difference and I am sure increased my love for TinTin by leaps and bounds.  The 3D TinTin something to behold!!!This is one movie I am so glad I purchased on Blu Ray. I really want to watch it again and again.  I feel I only skimmed the surface the first time through.The plot is somewhat complex.  The characters are remarkable.  TinTin and Snowy captured from what I can see, the comic characters to a T.It is a very fast paced action film that never ever stops for a second.  But that is how the comic book is. One thing after another.That being said, it got under my skin.  The motion capture photography is like nothing I have ever seen before.  It is spectacular. The colors are cinematic wonders.  Spielberg outdid himself. I feel this is the Indiana Jones I had been told was so great. I loved this movie a thousand times more than every Indian Jones put together. But I am sure that is just me.The animation is in a class by itself. And the movie has stuck with me in a way no movie does. I can't get it out of my mind.I am surprised by the tepid amount of reviews for TinTin.  Maybe it is an American thing. I think in Europe where TinTin is well known it was a smash hit.I loved it so much.  What a wonderful film!!!  I had no idea I would even like it.  I did not even have any big expectations for it once it was released here in the US.  I do not want to give anything away so I won't talk plot here.  Just that TinTin buys a ship that holds many secrets untold. That is all I want to say.I hear Peter Jackson is going to direct the next TinTin.  Wow. I cannot wait.",5,TinTin is a delight!!!

1323797,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0034G4P4O,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'The Adventures of Tintin' has been described as a ""3D motion capture computer-animated epic adventure."" Like many Spielberg productions, the story represents a hearkening back to yesteryear. It's similar to Spielberg's 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' series, in that it involves a search for lost treasure, in the spirit of the old radio and movie serials. It also involves the struggle between a clear cut noble protagonist and calculating, villainous antagonist.I never really was able to figure out how old Tintin, the young journalist protagonist, is supposed to be. Somehow probably between 16 and possibly 22. Anyway, the plot is not overly complicated. Tintin buys a model ship, the Unicorn, at a flea market and it's actually one of three models, that contain a scroll. When pieced together, the three scrolls, reveal the location of sunken treasure.Tintin's model ship is stolen by Sakharine, the antagonist, who later is revealed to be a descendant of Red Rackham, a pirate who attempted to gain possession of the actual 17th century ship, The Unicorn; but he ends up being thwarted by the ship's captain, Sir Francis Haddock, who intentionally sank  The Unicorn, in order to prevent Rackham from taking possession of the treasure on board. It turns out that Haddock's descendant, Captain Haddock, is manning an old freighter, which Sakharine takes over by inducing a mutiny amongst the ship's crew, in order to pilot it to Bagghar, a fictional port city in colonial French Morocco, where he intends to steal the third model ship, from a powerful, well-to-do sheik.Where 'Tintin' really takes off is in the deliriously choreographed 3D motion capture computer-animated sequences. There's a chase involving Silk, a pickpocket, in late 40s (?) or early 50s (?) Brussels, who has stolen Tinton's scroll from Unicorn #1. Then there's another great sequence where Tinton and a drunken Haddock escape the freighter in a lifeboat and eventually make their way to Morocco in a stolen seaplane. If that isn't enough, Sakharine steals the third scroll during an operatic concert for the Sheikh, given by a woman who reminded me of Margaret Dumont (from the Marx Brothers). Finally, there's a great chase scene, where the good guys finally apprehend Sakharine.'Tintin' falls flat in its attempt to be periodically humorous. There are two Scotland Yard detectives, Thompson and Thompson, who are too inept to be funny and then there's Captain Haddock, whose drunk act, proves ultimately tiresome. Tintin himself simply doesn't have enough idiosyncrasies to be a compelling protagonist, and comes across as a generic sleuth. What really kills 'Tintin' in terms of narrative, is the lack of a romantic interest for Tintin or at least some kind of female foil, that could spark things up. Tintin has a lot of action for prepubescent boys, but adults will probably find quite a bit of this stuff, simply juvenile. I recommend Tintin for all the technical wizardry, but the target audience is really best suited for ages eight through twelve!",3,Adults will dig all the 3D motion capture technical wizardry but its narrative is best viewed by prepubescent boys,1378080000,"09 2, 2013",2013,3070,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', ""***'The"", 'Adventures', 'Tintin', 'been', 'described', '3D', 'motion', 'capture', 'computer-animated', 'epic', 'adventure', 'many', 'Spielberg', 'productions', 'story', 'hearkening', 'back', 'yesteryear', 'similar', 'Spielberg', ""'Raiders"", 'Lost', 'Ark', 'series', 'search', 'lost', 'treasure', 'spirit', 'old', 'radio', 'movie', 'serials', 'also', 'struggle', 'clear', 'cut', 'noble', 'protagonist', 'calculating', 'villainous', 'antagonist.I', 'never', 'really', 'was', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'old', 'Tintin', 'young', 'journalist', 'protagonist', 'supposed', 'be', 'Somehow', 'probably', '16', 'possibly', '22', 'Anyway', 'plot', 'not', 'overly', 'complicated', 'Tintin', 'model', 'ship', 'Unicorn', 'flea', 'market', 'actually', 'one', 'three', 'models', 'contain', 'scroll', 'When', 'pieced', 'together', 'three', 'scrolls', 'reveal', 'location', 'sunken', 'treasure.Tintin', 'model', 'ship', 'stolen', 'Sakharine', 'antagonist', 'who', 'later', 'revealed', 'be', 'descendant', 'Red', 'Rackham', 'pirate', 'who', 'attempted', 'gain', 'possession', 'actual', '17th', 'century', 'ship', 'Unicorn', 'up', 'being', 'thwarted', 'ship', 'captain', 'Sir', 'Francis', 'Haddock', 'who', 'intentionally', 'sank', 'Unicorn', 'order', 'prevent', 'Rackham', 'taking', 'possession', 'treasure', 'board', 'out', 'Haddock', 'descendant', 'Captain', 'Haddock', 'manning', 'old', 'freighter', 'Sakharine', 'over', 'inducing', 'mutiny', 'ship', 'crew', 'order', 'pilot', 'Bagghar', 'fictional', 'port', 'city', 'colonial', 'French', 'Morocco', 'where', 'steal', 'third', 'model', 'ship', 'powerful', 'well-to-do', 'sheik.Where', ""'Tintin"", 'really', 'off', 'deliriously', 'choreographed', '3D', 'motion', 'capture', 'computer-animated', 'sequences', 'chase', 'involving', 'Silk', 'pickpocket', 'late', '40s', 'early', '50s', 'Brussels', 'who', 'stolen', 'Tinton', 'scroll', 'Unicorn', '1', 'Then', 'great', 'sequence', 'where', 'Tinton', 'drunken', 'Haddock', 'escape', 'freighter', 'lifeboat', 'eventually', 'make', 'way', 'Morocco', 'stolen', 'seaplane', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Sakharine', 'third', 'scroll', 'operatic', 'concert', 'Sheikh', 'given', 'woman', 'who', 'reminded', 'Margaret', 'Dumont', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'Finally', 'great', 'chase', 'scene', 'where', 'good', 'guys', 'finally', 'apprehend', 'Sakharine', 'falls', 'flat', 'attempt', 'be', 'periodically', 'humorous', 'are', 'two', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'Thompson', 'Thompson', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'inept', 'be', 'funny', 'then', 'Captain', 'Haddock', 'drunk', 'act', 'ultimately', 'tiresome', 'Tintin', 'simply', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'idiosyncrasies', 'be', 'compelling', 'protagonist', 'across', 'generic', 'sleuth', 'What', 'really', ""'Tintin"", 'terms', 'narrative', 'lack', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Tintin', 'least', 'kind', 'female', 'foil', 'could', 'spark', 'things', 'up', 'Tintin', 'lot', 'action', 'prepubescent', 'boys', 'adults', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'quite', 'bit', 'stuff', 'simply', 'juvenile', 'recommend', 'Tintin', 'technical', 'wizardry', 'target', 'audience', 'really', 'best', 'suited', 'ages', 'eight', 'twelve']",N/A

1323807,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B0034G4P4O,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[2, 2]","Steven and I are the same age, so I was surprised when he said that -- though he'd taken French in high school -- he'd never heard of TinTin until 1981. I took Spanish, but often saw the TinTin (and Asterix) comics used in French classes laying around.Though this film appears to be reasonably faithful to the original, TinTin (who was obviously created as a contemporary hero for boys) just doesn't work well as a film. There are many problems translating a fundamentally unbelievable cartoon character to a fundamentally realistic medium (film), and ""TinTin"" suffers from many of them. *Though TinTin acts like an adult, he looks like a short boy who's barely halfway through adolescence. And he carries a semi-automatic pistol, which -- though obviously needed for protection -- is discomfiting. The stories -- mostly mysteries and adventures -- have little, if any, real drama (strong/important human interactions). (I'm assuming here; I haven't read the books. Tom McCarthy, a TinTin expert, would likely vigorously disagree.) There is little that would appeal to adult sensibilities. I really don't /care/ about TinTin, one way or the other.Spielberg said that he didn't want ""TinTin"" to look like ""Indiana Jones"" and, unfortunately, it doesn't. All the Indiana Jones films are, at some level, people stories with something more-important at stake than simply recovering an artifact. ** But in ""TinTin"", finding a treasure to line one's pocket is the raison d'etre of the adventure.The character design is terrible. TinTin becomes a believable human, but most of the other characters have their noses inflated to outrageous proportion, as if they were descended from Cyrano by way of Malden.Perhaps the worst thing about ""TinTin"" is that Steven Spielberg has succumbed to making a film that is nothing but action. Such films (eg, ""The Mummy"", ""Clash of the Titans"") are boring, because action sequences work best when they're separated by quiet moments -- especially ones with real emotion (or its filmic simulacrum). You can't ramp up the tension before you've let it fall back for a while. (See ""Die Walkure"", Act 1.)As for John Williams' score... The title music is lively and unexpected jazz, but the rest of it is the same old same-old.It's diffcult to recommend ""TinTin"" as a film you're likely to want to watch more than once. But there is one laugh-out-loud visual joke (just one, unfortunately) that borrows from another Spielberg film.* ""TinTin"" is worth seeing for Weta's startling achievement in creating photorealistic humans.

We loved it and I thought it did a great job capturing the essence of the characters and the book, while also making the story approachable to newcomers who didn't know Tintin.The movie is a mashup of several books, but the choice of storyline was excellent to serve up a self-contained adventure and introduce us to Tintin and Haddock together.  This movie packs a lot of story in a relatively short time.The characters are well done and they resisted white-washing Haddock's alcoholism, which was certainly a big problem in the earlier books.Last and certainly not least, full use was made of the possibilities of an animated movie.  Take for example the early scene where Snowy chases the car and goes through a herd of cows.  There is no way you could film this scene with a dog and real cows, but this is precisely where cgi animation shines - on a relatively ordinary subject matter that can't be done for real.The chase scene at the end is perhaps a bit over the top, but... hey, it's a comic book adaptation after all.Good job.",5,Pleasantly surprised,1333411200,"04 3, 2012",2012,1101,"['got', 'Blu-Ray', 'settled', 'down', 'watch', 'kids', 'loved', 'thought', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'essence', 'characters', 'book', 'also', 'making', 'story', 'approachable', 'newcomers', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Tintin.The', 'movie', 'mashup', 'several', 'books', 'choice', 'storyline', 'was', 'excellent', 'serve', 'up', 'self-contained', 'adventure', 'introduce', 'Tintin', 'Haddock', 'together', 'movie', 'lot', 'story', 'relatively', 'short', 'time.The', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'resisted', 'white-washing', 'Haddock', 'alcoholism', 'was', 'certainly', 'big', 'problem', 'earlier', 'books.Last', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', 'full', 'use', 'was', 'made', 'possibilities', 'animated', 'movie', 'Take', 'example', 'early', 'scene', 'where', 'Snowy', 'car', 'herd', 'cows', 'way', 'could', 'film', 'scene', 'dog', 'real', 'cows', 'precisely', 'where', 'cgi', 'animation', 'shines', 'relatively', 'ordinary', 'subject', 'matter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'done', 'real.The', 'chase', 'scene', 'end', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'top', 'hey', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptation', 'all.Good', 'job']",N/A

I gave it a try and, while it won't top any of my ""best-of"" lists, it did provide a great deal of adventure, drama, action, and humor, pleasantly surprising me in the process.For a basic plot summary, ""Adventures of Tintin"" focuses on the young Tintin (voice of Jamie Bell), a kind of Indiana Jones-type adventurer along with trusty sidekick dog Snowy.  When young Tintin buys a model ship at an auction one day, he is suddenly thrust into a race for treasure involving a drunken sea captain (voice of Andy Serkis) and his nefarious foe (voice of Daniel Craig).I would say that the long-lasting effects of this film will be two-fold:First, I would still categorize it as very much a children's movie.  It could probably best be described as ""Indiana Jones for the elementary set"" in terms of its combination of all genre elements.  Had I first viewed this film as a child, I know that I would have watched it again and again!  For adults, of course, it also functions as escapism.Also, the somewhat controversial animation (is this middle ground needed between reality and Pixar-like animation?) is truly a sight to behold.  I honestly am not any sort of expert on the subject and thus have no predictions for the future of the format, but the visuals are as top-notch as anything you'll see anywhere else.  It is just...different.Overall, ""Adventures of Tintin"" just seems like Spielberg's childhood epic.  Perhaps the film can be appreciated even more if one has read the comic novel stories it is based on (I didn't even know about this until after the viewing!).  On the whole, though, a very entertaining flick that makes for great family viewing.",4,A Rollicking Adventure For The Kids (Or The Kid In All Of Us),1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,1837,"['not', 'movie', 'would', 'usually', 'be', 'drawn', 'too', 'looked', 'bit', 'unabashedly', 'kiddie', 'tastes', 'came', 'highly', 'recommend', 'family', 'member', 'obsessed', 'Spielberg', 'filmmaking', 'gave', 'try', 'wo', ""n't"", 'top', 'best-of', 'lists', 'did', 'provide', 'great', 'deal', 'adventure', 'drama', 'action', 'humor', 'pleasantly', 'surprising', 'process.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Adventures', 'Tintin', 'young', 'Tintin', 'voice', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'kind', 'Indiana', 'Jones-type', 'adventurer', 'trusty', 'sidekick', 'dog', 'Snowy', 'When', 'young', 'Tintin', 'model', 'ship', 'auction', 'one', 'day', 'suddenly', 'thrust', 'race', 'treasure', 'involving', 'drunken', 'sea', 'captain', 'voice', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'nefarious', 'foe', 'voice', 'Daniel', 'Craig', '.I', 'would', 'say', 'long-lasting', 'effects', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'two-fold', 'First', 'would', 'still', 'categorize', 'very', 'much', 'children', 'movie', 'could', 'probably', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'elementary', 'set', 'terms', 'combination', 'genre', 'elements', 'Had', 'first', 'viewed', 'film', 'child', 'know', 'would', 'have', 'watched', 'again', 'again', 'adults', 'course', 'also', 'escapism.Also', 'somewhat', 'controversial', 'animation', 'middle', 'ground', 'needed', 'reality', 'Pixar-like', 'animation', 'truly', 'sight', 'behold', 'honestly', 'am', 'not', 'sort', 'expert', 'subject', 'thus', 'have', 'predictions', 'future', 'format', 'visuals', 'are', 'as', 'top-notch', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'see', 'anywhere', 'else', 'just', 'different.Overall', 'Adventures', 'Tintin', 'just', 'Spielberg', 'childhood', 'epic', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'even', 'more', 'one', 'read', 'comic', 'novel', 'stories', 'based', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'viewing', 'whole', 'though', 'very', 'entertaining', 'flick', 'great', 'family', 'viewing']",N/A
