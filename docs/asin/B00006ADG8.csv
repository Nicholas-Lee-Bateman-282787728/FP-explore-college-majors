Also, it's Peter Ustinov's masterly direction that makes it a wonderful experience to sit through. You may think Billy Budd is another run-of-the-mill mutiny-on-the-ship picture, but it's not. The only thing that I wished was Billy Budd to be in color. I think it would have been better. I was surprised at the outcome in the last thirty minutes and agreed with it regardless. All in all, Billy Budd is a terrific film to watch, and Terence Stamp makes it all to work so well.",5,Terence Stamp's Shining Performance.,1319328000,"10 23, 2011",2011,590,"['Viewed', '10/11Rate', '910/11', 'Obviously', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'performance', 'Billy', 'Budd', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'Also', 'Peter', 'Ustinov', 'masterly', 'direction', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'sit', 'may', 'think', 'Billy', 'Budd', 'run-of-the-mill', 'mutiny-on-the-ship', 'picture', 'not', 'only', 'thing', 'wished', 'was', 'Billy', 'Budd', 'be', 'color', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'was', 'surprised', 'outcome', 'last', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'agreed', 'regardless', 'Billy', 'Budd', 'terrific', 'film', 'watch', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'work', 'so', 'well']",N/A

Herman Melville's ""Billy Budd, Foretopman"" is one such classic.In addition to being an outstanding story with great, solid characters, this is based on the actual events that occurred within the British Navy during its war with France. The major mutiny at the English port of Spithead, had word reached the sailing fleet, would have undermined Britain's stand against Napoleon and a potential French invasion.Billy Budd, a simple lad and merchant seaman, is pressed into service in the Royal Navy on the high seas, a common practice of the time. Out of the entire merchant crew, he is the only one who says he will keep his knowledge of the Spithead mutiny to himself - a mutiny that eventually brought major changes to the treatment of British sailors.The backstory, as are so many, is one of good vs. evil. However, without hitting the reader or viewer over the head with unrelenting morality, the story itself, the acting by classic actors and the direction by Peter Ustinov, who also stars as Captain Vere, work together to bring that essence to the fore.The entire story takes place on a British Man-o-War in 1797. In addition to Peter Ustinov, Terence Stamp makes his major film role debut. Other stars include Robert Ryan, Melvin Douglas and a very young David McCallum (Dr. ""Ducky"" Mallard on TV's NCIS). There are also many other well known actors in supporting roles.For anyone who enjoys a great story, this is a movie to watch. For anyone who enjoys great historical fiction, especially on the high seas, this is a must.

Please believe everything positive people say about this film and more.  There will simply never be a better cast assembled to film this Melville novella, and the handling and treatment are visionary and extraordinary.......except the last 3 minutes -- so far afield of Melville's subtlety and lesson as to be incomprehensible.  Melville's story was somewhat enhanced for dramatic purposes up to this point, but all the choices were sound.  And then it was undone.I am witholding saying more as not to give it away, just as a warning -- especially to those who know and love Melville.  His ending could have been very simply done, and the meanings inherent here would have blossomed to cosmic proportion.  As they do in Melville's final pages.  This ends up something much more limited.  But you still have perhaps the greatest performances of all the actors involved, in any movie I have ever seen any of them in.

709116,A1AC9S8U66SNMU,B00006ADG8,Buenoslibros.es,"[2, 2]","Peter Ustinov directed this unambitious work and made a great film. Beautifully shot in black & white, the story is based on a play after Melville's famous story. Billy Budd has to leave the merchant ship ""The Rights of Man"" to embark on the British man-of-war ""Avenger"". He is all innocent and cheerful, he represents goodness itself. His good nature will charm all on board, but will he charm evil in person: the master-of-arms played perfectly by Robert Ryan? There's a philosophical undertone during all the film, a debate between good and evil, and between choosing to do what the law says and what one feels to be the right thing (that is, justice). At times this slows down the pace of the film as it becomes too obvious, to the detriment of the plot itself, which becomes too static.I am glad this film was shot in black and white, as it suits the theme perfectly: evil vs goodness; man's laws vs the natural law of God. There are a few moments that are really intense and beautiful. For instance when Billy Bud (Terence Stamp) tries to have a conversation with evil Robert Ryan, the master-at-arms. Robert Ryan is astounded at this young man's simplicity and inability to hate: ""-Is it ignorance or irony that makes you speak so simply? -Must be ignorance, sir. 'Cause I don't understand the other word.""It's not the kind of film you would expect seeing the colorful poster: it has hardly any action. But it's a very good film.

Unlike Melville's tale, when this movie is over it's over.  At the heart of the problem is Peter Ustinov.

Ustinov's Starry Vere is everybody's favourite uncle.  No sulphur fumes here.  Melvyn Douglas as Dansker gives such a sly, knowing performance that he seems ideal for the role of Vere.  He might have put back all the ambiguities & nuances Ustinov removed.  Terence Stamp making his screen debut makes a sensational Billy & he earned himself a best supporting actor Oscar nomination.  (Years later he would play a similiar role in Pasolini's THEOREMA.)  Robert Ryan's Claggart is magnificent.  His evil is worthy of Melville; it's almost Miltonian.

Gittins,"[34, 36]","""Billy Budd"" is based on Herman Melville's last novel, and is a story of morality, military duty and social responsibility.Except for the first few minutes on another ship, the movie takes place on a British man-o-war, in 1797. The British ship stops a merchant ship and impresses the young naive Billy into the British navy, which is at war with France. Billy is soft-spoken and outgoing, and soon makes friends with the crew. However, he unknowingly gets on the bad side of the sadistic master-at-arms Claggart, until Billy is falsely accused of mutiny by him. Stammering and unable to form a verbal response, Billy reflexively hits Claggart and accidentally kills him. Now, sympathetic Captain Vere and a board of inquiry must decide Billy's fate.The movie is perfectly acted by all, especially Peter Ustinov (who also directed) as Captain Vere, Robert Ryan as Claggart, and Terence Stamp in his critically-acclaimed first role, as Billy Budd.This is an excellent movie that deserves a better, and/or cheaper, DVD. The ""digitally mastered"" phrase referring to this DVD only means it uses binary ""1""s and ""0""s, not that the picture is enhanced or even any good. In fact the otherwise nice black-and-white photography suffers from whatever old print the DVD was made from, as the whites tend to glow, and the contrast and image quality are pretty soft.

But is it really about the balance of law with justice?  Can there even be justice without mercy?The year is 1797.  Billy Budd (Terence Stamp) is a young sailor on a merchant ship with the name ""Rights of Man"" emblazoned on its hull.  He is drafted onto the HMS Avenger, a British fighting ship on the track of the French navy.  Young Billy is an innocent.  His fellows respond to his nave charm and gentle kindness.  That is, everyone but John Claggert, Master d'Arms (Robert Ryan).  Claggert is a sadist who delights in harsh punishment for even minor offenses.  Though he despises Billy, he too is drawn to Billy.  Claggert hates this weakness of his soul.  He suppresses these last glimmers of human feeling and takes his fury and hatred out on Billy, aiming to destroy him.Billy is a kind of classic Christ story.  Evil is very real as it manifests itself in Claggert.  Ustinov's Captain Vere is the mirror image of Claggert.Stamp is remarkable as young Billy.  His minimalist, understated performance earned him an Academy Award nomination.But it is Ustinov's vision and control over this production that makes it what it is: an extraordinary meditation on good, evil and the human condition.

Bernard ""suepera""","[63, 66]","First off, let me make sure that it is clear my review refers to the March 6, 2007 release of Billy Budd from Warner Bros. for the reasonable price of about $15. I pre-ordered it before March 6th & it arrived today. I am ecstatic. In fact, I have a confession to make; I invited all the reviewers on this page to be my friend, just so I could message them & let them know about this new release. I have also uploaded a pict of the cover from the DVD to help distinguish it from that other awful copied version.MOVIE - 5 STARS, DVD - 5 STARS.Like many, I saw this movie when I was young and it made a great impression on me- I have never forgotten it. I was in 10th grade in literature class and that was about 24 years ago (holy smokes!) This movie, adapted from the Herman Melville story is about many things- its complexity and nuances are something wonderful to behold. I have read the story and seen the movie & I must say, I prefer Ustinov's adaptation to the book. I think Ustinov did a more than masterful job of acting, directing, producing and writing. Not many people can wear 4 ""hats"" so very well. I personally have always felt this was his opus magnum- and I've heard it was a personal favorite of his. To me he captures so much of the struggle of what it is to be human in every frame of this movie. From the every day struggles of dignity to the struggle between the law and justice.The acting by all is wonderful. Terrance Stamp's screen debut is perfect. His understated way is just what Billy needed. Robert Ryan is the perfect villain- why? Because he is HUMAN- like us all, he struggles with his own demons- his are just closer to the surface than most. In that unforgettable scene on the deck at night with Billy, it is almost as heart-wrenching as the final scene where injustice makes its ugly presence known. In the deck scene with Claggart you can see the armor of his slowly drop, there's just a hint of a tear in his left eye-  and then, in a flash, his armor of evil is back in full force. Ryan's performance is just awesome to behold! How lucky are we all to have this entire movie on DVD to enjoy for years to come!All of the supporting roles are well done- all believable. The on location shots in Spain on the open seas are fabulous! It adds a huge sense of reality to the whole movie. Lighting and the music is just beautiful too.The extra features... yes, I'm such a fanatic, the minute I checked the mail I put the DVD in & listened to the commentary by Stamp & Soderbergh. If you are looking to find out a lot about the movie, you may be disappointed- if you wanted to find out a lot about Terrance Stamp, you'll be happy. He speaks at length about his own career and some things unrelated to the movie. There is not a lot of scene by scene commentary. He does speak about Ustinov and some of the things about production. His discourse is erudite and even occasionally stimulating. Soderbergh is in the role of an interviewer in this case. I enjoyed the commentary, but one does wonder how much it would've been enriched if someone had gotten off their dead butts & done this before Ustinov died. (I mourn him openly- he was my renaissance man- funny, smart and a humanitarian.)All and all, I'm quite pleased to have this DVD. I'm thankful to Warner Bros. for putting it out on DVD with a quality picture and sound.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5,THIS IS THE NEW WB DVD & IT'S GREAT!
