948566,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000BR9RQK,A Customer,"[5, 14]","About thirty minutes into Gael Morel's Three Dancing Slaves ""Le Clan"" there is an ugly scene being played out. One character, a young man by the name of Marc (Nicholas Cazale) is forced by a group of thugs to throw his beloved pet dog over a ravine, a rocky cliff face. The dog is severely injured, so Marc proceeds to finish him off by bashing him with a rock.Knowing that this scene was simulated doesn't help soften the impact. Directors and writers shouldn't be in the business of using the deliberate killing and torture of animals as a narrative thread or even to make some kind of dramatic point. Our role is to protect and nurture animals; they are the innocents, and any gratuitous images of animal cruelty whether it's real or fictitious is just not something that should be portrayed in film.Three Dancing Slaves is supposed to be a quasi meditation on male sexuality and the fraternal bonds that tie together three brothers in a small French town; it's almost voyeuristic in its intent, but the problem is that the film just isn't that interesting.Told in three parts, the film is lovingly crafted with some gorgeously evocative camera work, but the film is hampered by Morel, who gets sidetracked and far more concerned with highlighting the physical beauty of his subjects than showing what really lies beneath the surface of their disparate lives.Life is boring for Marc. Reeling from the death of his mother, and unhappy with the rules that his authoritarian father is setting, he gets involved in a life of petty crime. While he spirals through loops of drugs, transvestite sex and dog killing, shy youngest brother Olivier (Thomas Dumerchez) studies capoeira - the martial art that inspires the film's ungainly title - and falls in love with Marc's best friend.Meanwhile, older brother Christophe (Stephane Rideau), who has just been released from prison, goes straight and takes on a job in a pork factory. Marc resents Christoph's relationship with his father, and acts out his rebellious nature at home, while a frustrated father looks on with a kind of reserved paternal impotence. Things come to a climax after Marc's dog is killed as he's determined to take revenge in the killers.The problem is that none of the boys are that interesting, and it doesn't help that Mr. Morel has layered scene upon scene of them all being nasty to each other. The director never develops the boys into characters with separate histories, motivations and voices. And the one pivotal scene in which they are seen sleeping, full frontally nude in an undifferentiated, almost incestuous tangle, seems to come across more as some kind of voyeuristic self indulgence on the part of the director.Nothing about this film is remotely sexy or erotic although this was clearly Morel's intent. Instead, Three Dancing Slaves seems to take place mostly in some kind of vacuum, a dreamlike world of shirtless, well muscled but overly skinny boys and darkly moody interiors. This vaguely arty setting provides as good an excuse as any for those viewers interested in ogling attractive masculine flesh - although to be honest, none of it looks that great.The film is supposed to be gritty and hard-edged, and vaguely homoerotic, but it's none too substantial or particularly original, lacking any kind of fully-fledged drama or psychological complicity. And then there's that problem of animal cruelty...

948570,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000BR9RQK,Grady Harp,"[28, 32]","Gal Morel (Wild Reeds, Under Another Sky, Full Speed) seems to continue to test cinematic minefields and while not every film is a success, they each indicate that there is a reservoir of talent in this writer/actor/director that will eventually galvanize into to a significant voice. This much maligned little tale 'Le Clan' (oddly but in the end appropriately titled in English 'Three Dancing Slaves') has more going for it than most audiences acknowledge: for all its weakness there are some very sensitive moments about father/son relationships, filial love, romantic love, racism, bigotry, and the ever-growing dysfunctional family problem.Three brothers live with their recently widowed father in a small town near the Alps in France.  Marc (Nicolas Cazal&eacute;) is a rebellious youth, into drugs and petty crime and at constant contention with his overbearing father (Bruno Lochet); Christophe (St&eacute;phane Rideau) is recently released from prison and is trying to live straight by starting from the bottom in a pork factory and working his way to the top; Olivier (Thomas Dumerchez) is the youngest and though tattooed and quasi-rebellious is the sensitive one whose gender issues are just beginning to focus.  The film is told in three versions, one by each brother, and from these segments we paste together a family disrupted and needy.  Marc fights and performs dangerous deeds, Christophe struggles to re-create his broken life, and Olivier finds love and passion with Hicham (Salim Kechiouche), Marc's friend, who is North African and repeatedly dances the capoeira, a slave dance, for his own expression and his need to connect with Olivier.  Despite the differences in these young men there are repeated encounters that signify their bonding.  One quiet scene shows the father awake, sitting and watching the troubled sons asleep, naked, entwined in each other's bodies: it should be clipped for a still shot as it is very beautiful.There really is little resolution of an overall story; these three short stories simply end in their own fashion and the interlocking meaning is left to the viewer. Each brother is a 'slave' in his own manner. Yes, there are moments of violence, a pitiful animal abuse scene, and gaps in dialogue that bump the film around in a clumsy fashion, but look for the little moments of visual beauty and the movie takes on different meaning.

THREE DANCING SLAVES directed by Gael Morel is set in a small town in France where three young brothers, Marc, Christophe and Olivier, are trying to put their lives together after the death of their mother. They argue constantly with their father and often with each other.  The angst-ridden Marc gets into real trouble over a soured drug transaction; Christophe gets a dreary job in a meat plant after getting out of prison; and Olivier, the seventeen-year-old, is trying to find himself.Some of the landscape photography is gorgeous, and the acting by these three young men is certainly acceptable. There is a tremendously moving scene where Marc and Olivier secretly scatter their mother's ashes. The film never quite comes together, however, and some of the footage is completely inexplicable. For example, why does Marc need to shave his pubic area? Additionally although these three young men play brothers, they look nothing like each other.

Stephane Rideau from ""Come Undone"" plays Christophe, apparently the older brother who is in jail when their mother passes.  Olivier is the younger timid brother played by Thomas Dumerchez.  He begins a romance with Hicham played by Salim Kechiouche who teaches him an athletic slave dance.  The film hinges on Marc played by Nicolas Cazale.  Cazale's shaved head gives him a stark look throughout the film.  He won a Best Actor award for ""Le Grand Voyage"" in 2005 from the Newport International Film Festival.  He plays Marc well, a young man whose anger is barely controlled.  When drug dealers make him kill his beloved dog, Marc swears revenge, injuring himself when unable to go through with a planned hit & run.  Bruno Lochet plays the father who is emotionally lost after his wife's death, unable to give his sons the strong hand they need.  Morel toys with the audience, particularly in a sensual bath between Marc & his dog and with the three brothers sleeping arm in arm in nature's birthday suits as their father stares at them.  Their lives splinter as Christophe gets promoted at a meat packing plant and plans to marry.  Marc tries to recover from his severe injury.  Olivier breaks up with his boyfriend and appears to court the hand gliding instructor.  There is no great climax at which someone wins & loses.

948574,A14794N044AML4,B000BR9RQK,"Rolando A. Perez ""RAP""","[3, 4]","This is the second movie from director Gael Morel I have watched recently. The first one being ""Full Speed."" I rated ""Full Speed"" poorly. By watching this second movie, I understand why. I feel this director is very unorthodox in his expression of gay issues, and by being not familiar with his style of directing, am missing the point of what is being presented.His stories are about a bunch of people, mostly men, in a particular point of their lives. There is no main gay theme. These people could be gay or straight. There is violence in one or two of the characters. He is very much appreciative of the human male form, as all of his actors are very athletic, good looking, perfect bodies (no nerds.) He also makes an emphasis on Arab men, particularly from Algeria, North Africa.This movie revolves around three brothers, Marc, Christophe, and Olivier (the youngest.) Their mother had died painfully and all the boys missed her terribly. Christophe is in jail. He comes out of jail toward the middle of the movie and joins the family (he is straight.) There is one more boy, Hicham, an Arab young boy who is gay and friend of Marc. This boy becomes romantically involved with Olivier. Olivier being the only gay som in the family (he loose his virginity to Hicham without any of the other brothers knowing.) I am not sure what Marc is.Marc gets into trouble with the local thugs (drug dealers) because he owes them money. He gets beaten by them and he is forced to throw his prize dog over a cliff to the town river. I almost turn the movie off as I am an animal lover (I don't think there was any cruelty to the animal, it is just part of the story.) Marc wants revenge and to kill the thug who hurt him and kill his dog. He wants his brother Christophe to help him but he refuses. He then becomes bitter towards his brother. Toward the end of the movie, Marc gets hurt seriously by attempting to run over his nemesis, he misses his target totally, hitting a tree in the process. His anger got the best of him.Christophe gets a job in town after his release from jail and he gets promoted right way, and he finds a girl who is going to marry him, and his life seems to be progressing nicely. Hicham dumps Olivier (I do not know why) after using him. Hicham is a dancer and teaches Oliver the art. Olivier becomes real good (competitive). Marc becomes paralyzed but makes a struggling recovery. The final scene shows Olivier going into a building with a hand gliding instructor. Hicham has taught him to hand glide.Even though I found this movie to be better than ""Full Speed"", the plot was again somewhat confusing. These are not your ordinary ""gay"" movies. The scene of the three brothers, in an interlocking position, sleeping naked, is very provocative and erotic, talking about brotherly love (the father was totally mesmerized watching.)The movie near the French Alps making the scenery rather beautiful.",3,Different,1198368000,"12 23, 2007",2007,2916,"['second', 'movie', 'director', 'Gael', 'Morel', 'have', 'watched', 'recently', 'first', 'one', 'being', 'Full', 'Speed', 'rated', 'Full', 'Speed', 'poorly', 'watching', 'second', 'movie', 'understand', 'why', 'feel', 'director', 'very', 'unorthodox', 'expression', 'gay', 'issues', 'being', 'not', 'familiar', 'style', 'directing', 'am', 'missing', 'point', 'what', 'being', 'presented.His', 'stories', 'are', 'bunch', 'people', 'mostly', 'men', 'particular', 'point', 'lives', 'main', 'gay', 'theme', 'people', 'could', 'be', 'gay', 'straight', 'violence', 'one', 'two', 'characters', 'very', 'much', 'appreciative', 'human', 'male', 'form', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'athletic', 'good', 'looking', 'perfect', 'bodies', 'nerds', 'also', 'emphasis', 'Arab', 'men', 'particularly', 'Algeria', 'North', 'Africa.This', 'movie', 'around', 'three', 'brothers', 'Marc', 'Christophe', 'Olivier', 'youngest', 'mother', 'had', 'died', 'painfully', 'boys', 'missed', 'terribly', 'Christophe', 'jail', 'jail', 'middle', 'movie', 'family', 'straight', 'one', 'more', 'boy', 'Hicham', 'Arab', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'gay', 'friend', 'Marc', 'boy', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Olivier', 'Olivier', 'being', 'only', 'gay', 'som', 'family', 'loose', 'virginity', 'Hicham', 'other', 'brothers', 'knowing', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'Marc', 'is.Marc', 'trouble', 'local', 'thugs', 'drug', 'dealers', 'money', 'beaten', 'forced', 'throw', 'prize', 'dog', 'cliff', 'town', 'river', 'almost', 'turn', 'movie', 'am', 'animal', 'lover', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'cruelty', 'animal', 'just', 'part', 'story', 'Marc', 'revenge', 'kill', 'thug', 'who', 'hurt', 'kill', 'dog', 'brother', 'Christophe', 'help', 'then', 'bitter', 'brother', 'end', 'movie', 'Marc', 'hurt', 'seriously', 'attempting', 'run', 'over', 'nemesis', 'target', 'totally', 'hitting', 'tree', 'process', 'anger', 'got', 'best', 'him.Christophe', 'job', 'town', 'release', 'jail', 'promoted', 'right', 'way', 'girl', 'who', 'going', 'marry', 'life', 'be', 'progressing', 'nicely', 'Hicham', 'Olivier', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'using', 'Hicham', 'dancer', 'teaches', 'art', 'Olivier', 'real', 'good', 'competitive', 'Marc', 'paralyzed', 'struggling', 'recovery', 'final', 'scene', 'shows', 'Olivier', 'going', 'building', 'hand', 'gliding', 'instructor', 'Hicham', 'taught', 'hand', 'glide.Even', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'better', 'Full', 'Speed', 'plot', 'was', 'again', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'are', 'not', 'ordinary', 'gay', 'movies', 'scene', 'three', 'brothers', 'interlocking', 'position', 'sleeping', 'naked', 'very', 'provocative', 'erotic', 'talking', 'brotherly', 'love', 'father', 'was', 'totally', 'mesmerized', 'watching', 'movie', 'French', 'Alps', 'making', 'scenery', 'rather', 'beautiful']",Three Dancing Slaves

It is the story of an exceedingly dysfunctional family:  a bitter, ineffectual widower and his three sons.  The eldest, Christophe (Stephane Rideau) is an ex-con trying to straighten out his life.  Marc (Nicholas Cazale) is a rebellious, violent drug user.  Olivier (Thomas Dumarchez), the youngest, is a quiet, sensitive boy who misses his mother and her stabilizing influenceThis is a violent, often disturbing movie (the killing of Marc's dog and his subsequent attempts at revenge in particularly).Rideau, Cazale and Dumarchez are superb.  Salim Kechiouche, as the lover Olivier finds necessary to give up for the sake of his brothers, is also fine.  The letter he reads to Olivier, which frames the third segment, is heartbreaking.The cinematography is gorgeous.  (How could you go wrong with the French Alps as the backdrop?)  The musical score is rather intrusive, loud and somewhat repetitive.  The ending seems a bit forced given what has gone before.  But it does leave one with the sense that there is hope for these very damaged people.",4,You can't get any more dysfunctional than this!,1314316800,"08 26, 2011",2011,1172,"['very', 'good', 'film', 'director', 'Gael', 'Morel', 'not', 'level', 'Full', 'Speed', 'Apres', 'Lui', 'good', 'nonetheless', 'story', 'exceedingly', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'bitter', 'ineffectual', 'widower', 'three', 'sons', 'eldest', 'Christophe', 'Stephane', 'Rideau', 'ex-con', 'trying', 'straighten', 'out', 'life', 'Marc', 'Nicholas', 'Cazale', 'rebellious', 'violent', 'drug', 'user', 'Olivier', 'Thomas', 'Dumarchez', 'youngest', 'quiet', 'sensitive', 'boy', 'who', 'mother', 'stabilizing', 'influenceThis', 'violent', 'often', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'killing', 'Marc', 'dog', 'subsequent', 'attempts', 'revenge', 'particularly', '.Rideau', 'Cazale', 'Dumarchez', 'are', 'superb', 'Salim', 'Kechiouche', 'lover', 'Olivier', 'necessary', 'give', 'up', 'sake', 'brothers', 'also', 'fine', 'letter', 'Olivier', 'third', 'segment', 'heartbreaking.The', 'cinematography', 'gorgeous', 'How', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'French', 'Alps', 'backdrop', 'musical', 'score', 'rather', 'intrusive', 'loud', 'somewhat', 'repetitive', 'ending', 'bit', 'forced', 'given', 'gone', 'before', 'leave', 'one', 'sense', 'hope', 'very', 'damaged', 'people']",Three Dancing Slaves

Out of the three brothers in this film, the middle character has a pet dog.  Enough said.  Our of a boring first 30 minutes of slogging thru this film, I kept my eye on the dog.  After the first 30 minutes we're in with the eldest brother out of prison, played by Stephane Rideau, as it is now his chapter.  Rideau is a blank-stared waste of space here, unfortunate as he's usually the reliable dramatic/quirky/sexy one in other films, I guess the french don't know what to do with him, as he is generally fearless as an actor (even when he is staring into space, there's usually something more intense about it in other films). You think with Rideau in the film SOMETHING has to happen with this guy, but nothing does.  Like all the drama belongs to borderline gang member, brother #2 who shaves his head and entire body, in fact.  Brother #1 just wants to keep his head low and stay out of trouble; still, the career path skyward he takes, leaping over several union employees with seniority to become top dog at the plant, is bordering on fantasy.  btw Is Rideau aging badly or is it just a bad haircut?  As for brother #3 who is rather puppy-in-tow but also obviously the 'delicate, quite, sensitive' of the brothers, you already know what's going on with him before you get to the final segment which is devoted to his personal story, and his relationship with a young arab who loves him, so there's no real surprise, and I'm not sure there's meant to be, as this screenplay is crowded with cliches, including the sensitive youngest brother who still tells his dead mother everything going on in the family, and the eldest who aspires to be a patriarch and is disappointed with his lame father's lack of control over his family.  Why the elder brothers sleep together nude wrapped around each other, is the real mystery and never addressed, as they don't appear to have an incestuous relationship, so we're meant to enjoy the tangle of well-muscled limbs and the visual is only about that.  If you're looking to buy the film for sexual and or nudity content I would advise there's not enough of either to make it worth your while.  There might be some intense aggro for male viewers enjoying films where men are nasty to each other, emotionally and physically, and hence some sort of bonding is implied.",1,why was this film even made?,1136764800,"01 9, 2006",2006,2505,"['trying', 'give', 'plot', 'away', 'let', 'just', 'admit', 'whenever', 'have', 'pet', 'animal', 'film', 'humane', 'society', 'animal-doting', 'USA', 'film', 'something', 'very', 'BAD', 'going', 'happen', 'three', 'brothers', 'film', 'middle', 'character', 'pet', 'dog', 'Enough', 'said', 'boring', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'slogging', 'thru', 'film', 'kept', 'eye', 'dog', 'first', '30', 'minutes', ""'re"", 'eldest', 'brother', 'prison', 'played', 'Stephane', 'Rideau', 'now', 'chapter', 'Rideau', 'blank-stared', 'waste', 'space', 'here', 'unfortunate', 'usually', 'reliable', 'dramatic/quirky/sexy', 'one', 'other', 'films', 'guess', 'french', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'generally', 'fearless', 'actor', 'even', 'when', 'staring', 'space', 'usually', 'something', 'more', 'intense', 'other', 'films', 'think', 'Rideau', 'film', 'SOMETHING', 'happen', 'guy', 'nothing', 'drama', 'borderline', 'gang', 'member', 'brother', '2', 'who', 'head', 'entire', 'body', 'fact', 'Brother', '1', 'just', 'keep', 'head', 'low', 'stay', 'trouble', 'still', 'career', 'path', 'skyward', 'leaping', 'several', 'union', 'employees', 'seniority', 'become', 'top', 'dog', 'plant', 'bordering', 'fantasy', 'btw', 'Rideau', 'aging', 'badly', 'just', 'bad', 'haircut', 'brother', '3', 'who', 'rather', 'puppy-in-tow', 'also', 'obviously', ""'delicate"", 'quite', 'sensitive', 'brothers', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'get', 'final', 'segment', 'devoted', 'personal', 'story', 'relationship', 'young', 'arab', 'who', 'real', 'surprise', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'meant', 'be', 'screenplay', 'crowded', 'cliches', 'including', 'sensitive', 'youngest', 'brother', 'who', 'still', 'dead', 'mother', 'everything', 'going', 'family', 'eldest', 'who', 'be', 'patriarch', 'disappointed', 'lame', 'father', 'lack', 'control', 'family', 'Why', 'elder', 'brothers', 'sleep', 'together', 'nude', 'wrapped', 'other', 'real', 'mystery', 'never', 'addressed', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'have', 'incestuous', 'relationship', ""'re"", 'meant', 'enjoy', 'tangle', 'well-muscled', 'limbs', 'visual', 'only', ""'re"", 'looking', 'buy', 'film', 'sexual', 'nudity', 'content', 'would', 'advise', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'while', 'might', 'be', 'intense', 'aggro', 'male', 'viewers', 'enjoying', 'films', 'where', 'men', 'are', 'nasty', 'other', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'hence', 'sort', 'bonding', 'implied']",Three Dancing Slaves
