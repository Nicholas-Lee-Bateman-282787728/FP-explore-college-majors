1669793,A35XG6755DWOJV,B00EZ228FE,"albionphoto ""albion""","[0, 0]",The premise of Girls und Panzer consists of girls in tanks. What could go wrong with that? I thought this would be an entirely light hearted series with no real depth. How wrong I was. The animation of the characters is good but the combination of the excellent CGI of the tanks themselves makes it stand out. The story line is relatively simple featuring a reluctant commander who has to bring a collection of girls into the world of tankery. The characters and script are quite compelling keeping tension across the episodes with enough cliff hangers for a club of mountaineers. It kept me gripped and fascinated to see how the story ends with no slowing down or wasted episodes. A truly heartwarming experience.Just one sour note though. The third disk in my set was quite glitchy coming to a stuttering halt at a couple of points in the last two episodes. It did this on a PS3 and my DVD player so it's the disk not the system. Still gets 5 stars though.,5,Total surprise - what an excellent anime.,1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,958,"['premise', 'Girls', 'und', 'Panzer', 'girls', 'tanks', 'What', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'entirely', 'light', 'hearted', 'series', 'real', 'depth', 'How', 'wrong', 'was', 'animation', 'characters', 'good', 'combination', 'excellent', 'CGI', 'tanks', 'stand', 'out', 'story', 'line', 'relatively', 'simple', 'featuring', 'reluctant', 'commander', 'who', 'bring', 'collection', 'girls', 'world', 'tankery', 'characters', 'script', 'are', 'quite', 'compelling', 'keeping', 'tension', 'episodes', 'enough', 'cliff', 'hangers', 'club', 'mountaineers', 'kept', 'gripped', 'fascinated', 'see', 'how', 'story', 'slowing', 'down', 'wasted', 'episodes', 'truly', 'heartwarming', 'experience.Just', 'one', 'sour', 'note', 'third', 'disk', 'set', 'was', 'quite', 'glitchy', 'coming', 'stuttering', 'halt', 'couple', 'points', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'did', 'PS3', 'DVD', 'player', 'disk', 'not', 'system', 'Still', '5', 'stars']",Girls Und Panzer: TV Collection

1669797,A3IX22S8ULA9K8,B00EZ228FE,BW,"[1, 1]","First off, I want to say that I watched this series twice before buying it. I found it on a streaming site and couldn't wait until it came out on DVD. It has a mix of awesome tank battles and heartwarming personal interactions and also some funny stuff.The idea of high school girls fighting in tanks as a sport may sound strange but both the writers and animators pull it off very well. the battles are exciting and the plans are clever. They are also well paced. Some fighting anime make fights last forever which becomes drawn out and boring. These battles have the ideal length; long enough to see the heroes' sweat but short enough to feel fast paced.The character development is fantastic. The main team alone has almost two dozen characters and if you include enemy teams and other characters, the count reaches more than thirty. If a show can develop that many characters in a dozen episodes than there is no other word than &#34;fantastic&#34;. Miho's development as a commander and as a person deserves special mention as the contrast between the first and last episodes are remarkable and yet make perfect sense.There's plenty of funny stuff here generated by the cast's interactions; lots of good clean fun.I was disappointed by the English dub because many of the voices sounded off. I thought Miho sounded like a boy and that Anzu sounded like she was voiced by the same actor as an adult newswoman. I didn't include this in the rating because I figured I was too used to the subtitled Japanese.",5,A Mix of Heart and Guts,1396656000,"04 5, 2014",2014,1509,"['First', 'want', 'say', 'watched', 'series', 'twice', 'buying', 'found', 'streaming', 'site', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'mix', 'awesome', 'tank', 'battles', 'heartwarming', 'personal', 'interactions', 'also', 'funny', 'stuff.The', 'idea', 'high', 'school', 'girls', 'fighting', 'tanks', 'sport', 'may', 'sound', 'strange', 'writers', 'animators', 'pull', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'battles', 'are', 'exciting', 'plans', 'are', 'clever', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'paced', 'fighting', 'anime', 'make', 'fights', 'last', 'forever', 'drawn', 'out', 'boring', 'battles', 'have', 'ideal', 'length', 'long', 'enough', 'see', 'heroes', 'sweat', 'short', 'enough', 'feel', 'fast', 'paced.The', 'character', 'development', 'fantastic', 'main', 'team', 'alone', 'almost', 'two', 'dozen', 'characters', 'include', 'enemy', 'teams', 'other', 'characters', 'count', 'more', 'thirty', 'show', 'can', 'develop', 'many', 'characters', 'dozen', 'episodes', 'other', 'word', '34', 'fantastic', '34', 'Miho', 'development', 'commander', 'person', 'special', 'mention', 'contrast', 'first', 'last', 'episodes', 'are', 'remarkable', 'yet', 'make', 'perfect', 'plenty', 'funny', 'stuff', 'here', 'generated', 'cast', 'interactions', 'lots', 'good', 'clean', 'fun.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'English', 'dub', 'many', 'voices', 'sounded', 'off', 'thought', 'Miho', 'sounded', 'boy', 'Anzu', 'sounded', 'was', 'voiced', 'same', 'actor', 'adult', 'newswoman', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'rating', 'figured', 'was', 'too', 'used', 'subtitled', 'Japanese']",Girls Und Panzer: TV Collection

I really liked the alternate world where this took place with huge aircraft carrier schools and huge port's to go landside. The story isn't anything new a group of underdog's beating all odds to save their school but that doesn't mean it's bad this was done pretty well and it was fun to watch the girls come together and have fun with it. It would have been nice to have some question's answered like how the Tankery as they call it came to be and why only girls are involved.
