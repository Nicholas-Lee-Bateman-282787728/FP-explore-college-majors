861909,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,B00066VURU,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[2, 2]","The Marshall Tucker Band was unique in the history of Southern Rock. Citing influences from jazz, country and the blues the band from Spartenburg, South Carolina moved  from smoke filled bars to the largest of stadiums and arenas. Filmed in New Jersey in 1981 just months after the death of founder and bassist Tommy Caldwell, Live in the Garden State gives a great example of what the band could do in its prime.Guitarist Toy Caldwell, drummer Paul Riddle, guitarist George McCorkle, vocalist Doug Gray and reed player Jerry Eubanks played a concert that features both hits and rareties. Highlights include Heard it in a Love Song, Fire on the Mountain, Ramblin and Can't You See. The night was also special for a new network MTV who broadcast the concert.One my wonder at the three star rating. It is due primarily to the quality of the broadcast medium. The picture quality is muddy amd the editing was almost non existent. It seems the camera operators that night didn't have the musical cues the needed to spotlight the actual musicians as they played. There is some redemption in the age of the materials but overall the quality is quite lacking. Be sure to check out Daniel Meisner's short film Which One is Marshall Tucker? that is included as an extra. The short film is a great history of the band and features interviews with surviving members.Check this one out and remember how the music was.",3,Historic Night with the MTB,1242777600,"05 20, 2009",2009,1405,"['Marshall', 'Tucker', 'Band', 'was', 'unique', 'history', 'Southern', 'Rock', 'Citing', 'influences', 'jazz', 'country', 'blues', 'band', 'Spartenburg', 'South', 'Carolina', 'moved', 'smoke', 'filled', 'bars', 'largest', 'stadiums', 'arenas', 'Filmed', 'New', 'Jersey', '1981', 'just', 'months', 'death', 'founder', 'bassist', 'Tommy', 'Caldwell', 'Live', 'Garden', 'State', 'great', 'example', 'what', 'band', 'could', 'do', 'prime.Guitarist', 'Toy', 'Caldwell', 'drummer', 'Paul', 'Riddle', 'guitarist', 'George', 'McCorkle', 'vocalist', 'Doug', 'Gray', 'reed', 'player', 'Jerry', 'Eubanks', 'played', 'concert', 'hits', 'rareties', 'Highlights', 'include', 'Heard', 'Love', 'Song', 'Fire', 'Mountain', 'Ramblin', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'See', 'night', 'was', 'also', 'special', 'new', 'network', 'MTV', 'who', 'broadcast', 'concert.One', 'wonder', 'three', 'star', 'rating', 'due', 'primarily', 'quality', 'broadcast', 'medium', 'picture', 'quality', 'muddy', 'editing', 'was', 'almost', 'non', 'existent', 'camera', 'operators', 'night', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'musical', 'cues', 'needed', 'spotlight', 'actual', 'musicians', 'played', 'redemption', 'age', 'materials', 'quality', 'quite', 'lacking', 'Be', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'Daniel', 'Meisner', 'short', 'film', 'Which', 'One', 'Marshall', 'Tucker', 'included', 'extra', 'short', 'film', 'great', 'history', 'band', 'features', 'interviews', 'surviving', 'members.Check', 'one', 'out', 'remember', 'how', 'music', 'was']",N/A

They perform before a packed crowed who really ""get into"" the concert. The band is from Spartanburg, South Carolina.The line-up consists of: Doug Gray on lead vocals (he is an outstanding performer and has a great repore with the crowd), Toy Caldwell on guitar and lead vocals on ""Can't You See"", Paul Riddle on the drums, George McCorkle on the ""blues"" guitar, Jerry Eubank's on sax and flute, and a bass guitar player (I'm not sure of his name). They play very well together. George McCorkle can really ""jam"" on his ""blues"" guitar.Some highlights I liked included:  ""Take the Highway"", ""Heard it in a Love Song"", ""It takes time"", ""Rumors are raging"",(especially in a small town like Spartanbury, SC), ""Fire on the Mountain"", ""Ramblin"" (On my mind), and ""Can't YOu See"".Then they leave the stage, but are called out for an encore and Doug Gray tells the crowd ""there's no way we're going to leave now, besides I hear the traffic is real bad out-side"". Then they perform ""This ol' Cowboy"" (it won't be the 1st time this ol' cowboy has spent the night alone), ""Searchin for a Rainbow"", and an excellent end-all song ""Blue Ridge Mountain Sky"" (About the Spartanburg, SC area, and about an old man that has the best beagle hound in the county.Overall, this is a great 5 star classic concert dvd, and I highly recommend it.

Not so much for his backing away from the mike, but some technical difficulties that rose it's ugly head occasionally. Don't get me wrong. Doug's voice is in fine form and it shines %99.9 in this concert. If your familiar with Marshall Tucker, you'll know they are not visually entertaining. I mean their music is what entertains the crowd. The band just plays it well. I've seen Marshall Tucker many times when they were climbing up to their zenith. And this concert is captures them perfectly. With as many times as I have seen them I never knew Toy played lead with his thumb, but then again I was never this close.And as for the selection of songs, I couldn't be happier. I love the ""Dedicated"" Album. There is not one song on here I would have removed. While I have had the live version of ""Ramblin"" engrained in my brain, yea, I would have liked to see the bass solo here. Still no complaints.Video wise... Hey, it's 1981. Were probably lucky they caught it on film. So it does have a somewhat dated look. Some of editing has a little to be desired. Some camera movement too, but these are real nitpicky arguements (Nothing like the horrid first  Lynyrd Skynrd concert mess).

And for most of the kids I went with it was our first concert.The music:What I always liked about the Marshall Tucker Band is that it set itself apart from other southern rockers with it's own unmistakable sound (flute and sax), and unique style that blended country and rock with jazz. Here the band performs their classics ""Heard it in a Love Song"", ""Fire on the Mountain"", ""Can't You See"", and ""Searchin' for a Rainbow"". You'll see from this concert that Southern rock fans reach pretty far north. And what made this concert particularly poignant was that it was at a pivotal time for the band. It took place only a year after the death of original member Tommy Caldwell.DVD production:The video and sound quality is surprising good for being shelved nearly 25 years. The direction and editing are also good compared to other concert videos I've seen even today. Here, you get to see faces clearly, close-up instrumental work, the audience, backstage, etc. The disk includes a film on the band's history, featuring comments by Charlie Daniels . . . worth the DVD alone.It was fortunate MTV was around to capture MTB at a time when most concerts were not recorded.
