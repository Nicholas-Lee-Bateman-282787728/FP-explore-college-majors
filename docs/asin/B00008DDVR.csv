739101,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00008DDVR,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[13, 13]","The Lotte Berke Method is a non-traditional type of toning developed by a dancer of the same name. It supposedly focuses on the creation of long, lean (not bulky) muscles through the use of small, precise movements, and it has inspired similar methods such as Callanetics. A hallmark of this method is that stretching is included throughout the workout rather than just the at the beginning and the end; the emphasis is on shaping muscles through both strength AND stretch.In BASIC ESSENTIALS, the focus is on whole-body toning. The workout begins with a warm-up common to all 4 Lotte Berk videos: a type of high-legged marching in place followed by simple stretches. Then it's on to the floor to work the arms via several sets of Lotte Berk push-ups--they're tougher than they look! Standing work with a ballet barre (a high backed chair or even a wall can be substituted) comes next. You start with ballet-type squats done utilizing the ""Lotte Berk tuck"" position and the move on to leg kicks for the buttocks. These are tiny movements that only LOOK easy; they really target the thighs and glutes. Following this, it's back to the floor for abs work. This is the one part of the video that I found to be a bit disappointing; although the moves were definitely challenging, I felt it in my back more than in my abdominal area. The workout ends with the Lotte Berk ""knee dancing"" move that is pictured on the cover of the video--a signature move which provides further thigh work--as well as a ""shape by stretch"" section.BASIC ESSENTIALS is led by three Lotte Berk certified instructors. The main instructor, Stephanie, comes off a little condescending in her comments (eg, repeatedly saying things like ""where did you feel that?""), but she provides good cueing during the workout. The remaining two instructors do not speak, but one shows modifications. The Lotte Berk Method is great for all exercisers who are looking for a different but challenging strength workout, including those at a beginning level, and this tape would be particularly helpful for those looking to tone up the stubborn areas of the lower body. Overall, I'd rate it as 3 1/2 stars for a good workout with an instructor who can be annoying at times.",4,"Small, precise movements give an intense full-body workout",1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,2224,"['Lotte', 'Berke', 'Method', 'non-traditional', 'type', 'toning', 'developed', 'dancer', 'same', 'name', 'supposedly', 'creation', 'long', 'lean', 'not', 'bulky', 'muscles', 'use', 'small', 'precise', 'movements', 'inspired', 'similar', 'methods', 'such', 'Callanetics', 'hallmark', 'method', 'stretching', 'included', 'workout', 'rather', 'just', 'beginning', 'end', 'emphasis', 'shaping', 'muscles', 'strength', 'stretch.In', 'BASIC', 'ESSENTIALS', 'focus', 'whole-body', 'toning', 'workout', 'warm-up', 'common', '4', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'videos', 'type', 'high-legged', 'marching', 'place', 'followed', 'simple', 'stretches', 'Then', 'floor', 'work', 'arms', 'several', 'sets', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'push-ups', ""'re"", 'tougher', 'look', 'Standing', 'work', 'ballet', 'barre', 'high', 'backed', 'chair', 'even', 'wall', 'can', 'be', 'substituted', 'next', 'start', 'ballet-type', 'squats', 'done', 'utilizing', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'tuck', 'position', 'move', 'leg', 'kicks', 'buttocks', 'are', 'tiny', 'movements', 'only', 'LOOK', 'easy', 'really', 'target', 'thighs', 'glutes', 'Following', 'back', 'floor', 'abs', 'work', 'one', 'part', 'video', 'found', 'be', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'moves', 'were', 'definitely', 'challenging', 'felt', 'back', 'more', 'abdominal', 'area', 'workout', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'knee', 'dancing', 'move', 'pictured', 'cover', 'video', 'signature', 'move', 'further', 'thigh', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'shape', 'stretch', 'section.BASIC', 'ESSENTIALS', 'led', 'three', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'certified', 'instructors', 'main', 'instructor', 'Stephanie', 'off', 'little', 'condescending', 'comments', 'eg', 'repeatedly', 'saying', 'things', 'where', 'did', 'feel', 'good', 'cueing', 'workout', 'remaining', 'two', 'instructors', 'do', 'not', 'speak', 'one', 'modifications', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'Method', 'great', 'exercisers', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'different', 'challenging', 'strength', 'workout', 'including', 'beginning', 'level', 'tape', 'would', 'be', 'particularly', 'helpful', 'looking', 'tone', 'up', 'stubborn', 'areas', 'lower', 'body', 'Overall', ""'d"", 'rate', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'good', 'workout', 'instructor', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'annoying', 'times']",Lotte Berk Method For Beginners - Basic Essentials

This isn't a bad way to start; it resembles ballet, yoga, and Pilates.  The Lotte Berk Method relies more on holding muscle contractions than on endless reps of a move, and in that respect it can be challenging.  Although I didn't feel anything in my abs the next day, I will say that my thighs were extremely sore; however, this may have been because I did the bonus &quot;Blast&quot; workout directly after finishing the main one.  The main problem I have with this video is that Stephanie, the instructor, talks WAY too much.  Midway through the video I was yelling at the TV to just shut up and get on with the workout already!

739105,A26IPZJ4OA05RU,B00008DDVR,Food Fan,"[19, 21]","I dislike this video Not because it doesn't use traditional moves, but because it is not much of a workout for advanced exercisers and is too dangerous for beginners to use.  (It seems like the Lotte Berk method is potentially beneficial, but I wouldn't recommend this particular ""Essentials"" tape.  Instead, I think the ""The Bar Method"" videos better because that instructor concentrates on form and explains moves without stopping the flow of the workout, and is more suitable for a wider audience (simple exercises that beginners can do, but can be intensified for advanced)).In this Lotte Berk video the instructor spends A LOT of time explaining the next step, but does NOT do it in a way that emphasizes good form, so after a long talk it is still likely that the specific motion won't be done correctly (e.g. she doesn't point out don't drop your butt during the push ups, and doesn't point out that the bent knee exercises should be done with the knees parrallel to the toes).The types moves are too difficult in nature for beginners and very hard on the knees.However, since you end up doing so little reps and there is so much downtime, the workout is too boring and not challenging enough for more experienced exercisers.Summary of Moves:marching knee liftsARMS:  knee push ups, reverse push ups (kind of like dips working triceps), triceps stretchTHIGH(very tough on knees): hamstring stretch, plies, pelvic tuck, swing hips right/left, quad stretchSEAT: hip extensions, butt stretchABS: sit down holds, more stretchingthigh lifts (tough on the knees), thigh stretchmore stretching",1,"BORING for advanced, DANGEROUS for beginners",1167264000,"12 28, 2006",2006,1593,"['dislike', 'video', 'Not', ""n't"", 'use', 'traditional', 'moves', 'not', 'much', 'workout', 'advanced', 'exercisers', 'too', 'dangerous', 'beginners', 'use', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'method', 'potentially', 'beneficial', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'particular', 'Essentials', 'tape', 'Instead', 'think', 'Bar', 'Method', 'videos', 'better', 'instructor', 'form', 'moves', 'stopping', 'flow', 'workout', 'more', 'suitable', 'wider', 'audience', 'simple', 'exercises', 'beginners', 'can', 'do', 'can', 'be', 'intensified', 'advanced', '.In', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'video', 'instructor', 'LOT', 'time', 'explaining', 'next', 'step', 'NOT', 'do', 'way', 'good', 'form', 'so', 'long', 'talk', 'still', 'likely', 'specific', 'motion', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'done', 'correctly', 'e.g', ""n't"", 'point', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'drop', 'butt', 'push', 'ups', ""n't"", 'point', 'out', 'bent', 'knee', 'exercises', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'knees', 'parrallel', 'toes', '.The', 'types', 'moves', 'are', 'too', 'difficult', 'nature', 'beginners', 'very', 'hard', 'knees.However', 'end', 'up', 'doing', 'so', 'little', 'reps', 'so', 'much', 'downtime', 'workout', 'too', 'boring', 'not', 'challenging', 'enough', 'more', 'experienced', 'exercisers.Summary', 'Moves', 'marching', 'knee', 'liftsARMS', 'knee', 'push', 'ups', 'reverse', 'push', 'ups', 'kind', 'dips', 'working', 'triceps', 'triceps', 'stretchTHIGH', 'very', 'tough', 'knees', 'hamstring', 'stretch', 'plies', 'pelvic', 'tuck', 'swing', 'hips', 'right/left', 'quad', 'stretchSEAT', 'hip', 'extensions', 'butt', 'stretchABS', 'sit', 'down', 'more', 'stretchingthigh', 'lifts', 'tough', 'knees', 'thigh', 'stretchmore', 'stretching']",Lotte Berk Method For Beginners - Basic Essentials

I had 8 yrs of intensive ballet, and she reminds me very much of a strict ballet teacher, which must be why I like her.  She herself started ballet at age 3 and danced with the NY City Ballet.  The remarks she makes to draw one's attention to where the movement is felt, where it should be felt, are not meant to be condescending.  What she is trying to do is assist you in building the ""muscle memory"" of the correct form of the movement, so that when you have the movements memorized, and start doing them without the video, you will immediately know by the WAY IT FEELS whether you are doing them correctly.I thought this video was excellent with its instruction, as are all the LBM videos, although rather more beginner than ideal for my personal use.

739108,AVFPRHF73SF5B,B00008DDVR,KS Film Fan,"[0, 0]","I haven't been exercising in many years.  Recently I started again because I noticed my muscles were getting creaky.In the past, I experimented with a lot of different exercise regimes.  The worst for me was weight lifting.  Unlike the women in the videos, weight lifting didn't make me thin, it bulked me out. My legs were huge, my shoulders were huge etc. etc.  The best exercises for me were in my dance classes and videos with dance background.Lotte Berk's method was created by a dancer as an extra to help other dancers to strengthen and lengthen muscles.This video and the rest in the series are geared towards beginners.  The instructors are very attentive to form and careful in giving modification instructions for the exercises.  The workout is quick, no nonsense and annoyance free.  The instructors claim 10 sessions will help you feel better and in 20 you will see the results.  Personally I started seeing results by the 3rd to 5th session.  However I'm not sure if that result would be the same for all or it is just a matter of my body snapping back to dance form.These exercises are very isometric.  You need to pay attention to form and muscle feel.  It would be extremely easy to just do the work but not feel anything or get a workout.  Perhaps that is what accounts for the different impressions of this series.  If you have any dance training at all, the exercises will be familiar and you will know what to aim for in the workout.  It can and does leave others in the dark.Unfortunately Lydia Bach, who refined these exercises from Lotte Berk herself, has retired.  So I don't think we will get more videos then this video and the rest of the set.

739110,A3PFUI05LTX4S6,B00008DDVR,Ruth M. Brown,"[5, 5]","I tried this DVD for the first time and was quite impressed by how challenging it is for a beginner like me.  The exercises are not difficult to perform, at least a few times, and I found myself having to stop and rest a few moments, but then getting right back into the routine the instructor and her two companions were doing.  Not once do you pick up a weight, go to a machine, or start using a resistance cord, but by using the weight of your own body and moving in certain ways, you WILL surprise your muscles (and yourself) by putting every part of your body through some pretty tough paces.  If you are a beginner with at least a little familiarity with Pilates and/or yoga, this helps.  If you are determined to stick with a workout that is challenging but still possible to learn and master, and if you really want to do something that will transform your body if done faithfully, then these exercises are for you.Stretching is emphasized as an essential component to any workout that taxes the muscles, and you will be immediately doing exercises to stretch and relax the muscles you have just worked.  This also gives you a chance to get a short break from the vigorous muscle strengthening moves.  Even in an air-conditioned room, you should be prepared to perspire quite a bit.The only props you will need are the back of a sturdy chair (to use in lieu of a ballet bar) and a small towel to assist in your leg stretching moves.What I especially appreciated is the fact that although you are striving to achieve greater flexibility and strength, you are not trying to make yourself look like a female bodybuilder or even a heavily muscled female athlete.  Some women love the look of ""six-pack abs,"" bulging biceps, and veins that protrude through the skin.  That, plus a skin tone that makes some women in fitness magazines look like they've smeared barbecue sauce all over their skin is definitely not for me.  The Lotte Berk Method is for women who want to be fit, healthy, young and attractive well past middle age, but also thoroughly and unquestionably FEMININE.  If you want to look like a graceful and lithe dancer and not some androgynous freak, I highly recommend this workout.  I intend to try the other DVDs in the Lotte Berk series too.",5,Wow!

""Can you feel that?""(What I forgot to mention in the other reviews is another option for support is using the wall. Barbara, the most advanced person, uses the wall for support during two DVDs and the instructions for using the wall would seem obvious but aren't. Your forehead must remain against the wall and your arms pressed against the wall at the height of your head so if you're a beginner, don't use the wall, lol.)The barre work isn't so challenging here but this is a basic DVD so those exercises aren't prolonged, just a few for a good intro. The ab work, however, is another story. A few new ab moves that are really challenging and the Knee Dancing is not as fun as the knee dancing in Muscle Eats Fat but it does work your thighs.You also won't escape push-ups and those killer reverse push-ups, either.This instructor was really, truly annoying and during some segments, she started snapping her fingers and ... she was so offbeat. (more eyerolling) BUT believe it or not she DOES grow on you and the music is really cool in this DVD. But for first time users, I had to give that caveat. It's only fair. LOL!I can't give the work-out a thumbs down because once again, the instructions for the set-up are fantastic (if she'd only be quiet once the set-up was completed), the previews of the exercises before you do them are wonderful and the music (as in all of the DVDs) is relaxing and motivating at the same time. The exercises in Basic Essentials are what you already know with a trick or two thrown in for good measure.It's an excellent intro for anyone who hasn't done TBM or the other Lotte Berk DVDs. It won't scare you off. If you start with the others in the series, you may give up so start with this one or The Bar Method.The instructor here is good at what she does and friendly overall but her style and technique are annoying. You're really going to want to pinch her. So she gets a D.
