Frankly, I do not stick with the program consistently and go for stretches without exercising, but I blame that on me not the program. I always get back with it. It DOES work IF you stick with it.Billy Blanks has a great way of encouraging you. It is as if he is talking right to you, and you don't like to let him down! A reviewer below does not like all the talking. I do. He talks more than he does in his early videos, and I get inspiration and motivation from it.Thank you Billy Blanks!",4,Good exercise program,1238284800,"03 29, 2009",2009,590,"['think', 'Billy', 'Blanks', 'TaeBo', 'best', 'exercise', 'program', 'there', 'have', 'had', 'many', 'videos', 'Frankly', 'do', 'not', 'stick', 'program', 'consistently', 'go', 'stretches', 'exercising', 'blame', 'not', 'program', 'always', 'get', 'back', 'DOES', 'work', 'IF', 'stick', 'it.Billy', 'Blanks', 'great', 'way', 'encouraging', 'talking', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'let', 'down', 'reviewer', 'below', 'not', 'talking', 'do', 'more', 'early', 'videos', 'get', 'inspiration', 'motivation', 'it.Thank', 'Billy', 'Blanks']",Bill Blanks Taebo: T3 Total Transformation Training

If that first workout is slow, forget it! I can't keep up, and I just quit trying. What I can keep up with is fun though. If it wasn't so humiliating trying to keep up with this thing I would keep going. I hear the original Tae Bo is more oriented to beginners / those like me that are out of shape...I don't want to discourage anyone from trying this. It IS fun, and it really does help. I just want a slower start / workup to the speed they are going so folks like me can catch up without the rude reminder that we got fat and not so limber / fast....",3,Great workout.

1160283,A2T6MY3FL377HK,B0018LX9YE,French Door Fridge,"[0, 0]",This is a mid intense kind of workout which focus a lot in toning your arms and mid section since most of the time you are in doing your moves in core not standing totally straight up but vending your knees to focus in your legs and mid section.I personally enjoy it but I do combine it with other Tae-bo programs.Most of people all they do is complain about these DVD's but you need to give some to get some and change your body and attitude.,5,Great for Mid section,1338854400,"06 5, 2012",2012,443,"['mid', 'intense', 'kind', 'workout', 'lot', 'toning', 'arms', 'mid', 'section', 'most', 'time', 'are', 'doing', 'moves', 'core', 'not', 'standing', 'totally', 'straight', 'up', 'vending', 'knees', 'focus', 'legs', 'mid', 'section.I', 'personally', 'enjoy', 'do', 'combine', 'other', 'Tae-bo', 'programs.Most', 'people', 'do', 'complain', 'DVD', 'need', 'give', 'get', 'change', 'body', 'attitude']",Bill Blanks Taebo: T3 Total Transformation Training
1160284,A1FVHPHEIBDCP2,B0018LX9YE,Hot Cocoa,"[1, 1]","I really love Billy Blanks and think he is an inspiration to those wanting to be fit. I've had this DVD set for a few weeks and haven't really gotten past the first one yet. It seems like a good workout once you know the moves, but I have a hard time following since I'm not familiar with Tae Bo. Even in the first workout, the moves are very fast paced, and I notice I tend to get sloppy and not do the movement correctly trying to keep up. It's also hard to try to mimic the movement because facing the screen you are doing everything on the opposite side, and I find myself trying to move in the same direction as the people on the TV. I was hoping that this set would be a good introduction to Tae Bo, but feel it would be better if the first workout was slower and focused more on correct form rather than speed.",3,"Seems like a great workout, but not for beginners",1242777600,"05 20, 2009",2009,817,"['really', 'love', 'Billy', 'Blanks', 'think', 'inspiration', 'wanting', 'be', 'fit', ""'ve"", 'had', 'DVD', 'set', 'few', 'weeks', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'gotten', 'first', 'one', 'yet', 'good', 'workout', 'once', 'know', 'moves', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'following', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'Even', 'first', 'workout', 'moves', 'are', 'very', 'fast', 'paced', 'notice', 'tend', 'get', 'sloppy', 'not', 'do', 'movement', 'correctly', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'also', 'hard', 'try', 'mimic', 'movement', 'facing', 'screen', 'are', 'doing', 'everything', 'opposite', 'side', 'find', 'trying', 'move', 'same', 'direction', 'people', 'TV', 'was', 'hoping', 'set', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'introduction', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'feel', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'first', 'workout', 'was', 'slower', 'focused', 'more', 'correct', 'form', 'rather', 'speed']",Bill Blanks Taebo: T3 Total Transformation Training

But great for beginners and people who want's to get back in shape. The other people should do the Pure Power workouts. These workouts are realy great. During the Pure Power workouts, you use the T3-weights. These weights are wonderfull. Every workout has at the begining a technical review.You get six workouts on for DVDs plus Billy's Sensei learn the moves. You also get a booklet with to workout rotation calendar's and something else.A other great workout set from Billy Blanks.I also give five stars for this set.",5,Tae Bo T3 kicks my ass!!,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,642,"['love', 'great', 'workout', 'set', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'Power', 'Within', 'workouts', 'are', 'short', 'easy', 'form', 'great', 'beginners', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'get', 'back', 'shape', 'other', 'people', 'should', 'do', 'Pure', 'Power', 'workouts', 'workouts', 'are', 'realy', 'great', 'Pure', 'Power', 'workouts', 'use', 'T3-weights', 'weights', 'are', 'wonderfull', 'workout', 'begining', 'technical', 'review.You', 'get', 'six', 'workouts', 'DVDs', 'Billy', 'Sensei', 'learn', 'moves', 'also', 'get', 'booklet', 'workout', 'rotation', 'calendar', 'something', 'else.A', 'other', 'great', 'workout', 'set', 'Billy', 'Blanks.I', 'also', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'set']",Bill Blanks Taebo: T3 Total Transformation Training
