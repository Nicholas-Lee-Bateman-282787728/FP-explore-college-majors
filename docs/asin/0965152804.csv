This movie really had an impact on me and now I see the light. I wish everyone that watched it got the same feeling I got after watching it. I continue to follow Mr Brinkly by reading his books and going to his web site. this man amazing me with what he's been through.",5,What an excellent movie,1323043200,"12 5, 2011",2011,399,"['bought', 'movie', 'year', 'ago', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'Dannion', 'Brinkley', 'movie', 'really', 'had', 'impact', 'now', 'see', 'light', 'wish', 'everyone', 'watched', 'got', 'same', 'feeling', 'got', 'watching', 'continue', 'follow', 'Mr', 'Brinkly', 'reading', 'books', 'going', 'web', 'site', 'man', 'amazing', 'what', 'been']",N/A

I do seriously wonder about it's accuracy. (It's supposedly ""based on a true story"") This depiction of a ""near-death experience"" may be similar to what Dannion Brinkley (played by Eric Roberts) experienced but I wonder how much was conveniently left out or forgotten. The main point of the ""encounter"" seemed to be saying that Mr Brinkley was to ""love"".  There is nothing wrong with that...but the problem is that we humans are not able to do that without Jesus Christ. He paid the price for our sins on the cross and asked us to come to Him for forgiveness. When we do that and begin walking with Jesus and seeking more of Him, the Holy Spirit fills us...enabling us to truly love others.Mr Brinkley talks about various ""beings"" in the movie and on his website, never once mentioning God or Jesus; no mention of our sins, or the way to redemption. I truly hope that people don't view this film and determine that there is ""another"" way to enter into heaven. The Bible says "" For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."" Romans 6:23 and ""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved."" John 3:16,17.  Would God have allowed His Son to die on the cross if there was any another way?...Not according to the His Word. ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"". John14:6 If you are truly seeking peace and assurance of eternal joy, then look to God's Word.

167252,A3TMH3ESKQN3L4,0965152804,"W. Lambdin ""Two Bears""","[37, 42]","To put it bluntly, before his Near Death Experience, Dannion Brinkley was a miserable excuse for a human being.He was struck by lightening and pronounced dead for 28 minutes. He had a near death experience that turned his life upside down and inside out.I have heard Dannion speak several times, and I can say that he not only talks the talk, he actually walks the walk.A lot of people become very angry because Dannion's Near Death Experiences do not fit into their idea of Theology.I am sure that my idea of the Great Mystery (God if you prefer)would also make people very angry.There is ONLY one Creator; no matter what name various cultures or faiths use.The Great Mystery is the infinite being. We human beings are finite, and it is impossible for us finite beings to comprehend the infinite.The Great Mystery reveals itself to us in ways that we can understand based upon our level of awareness.If a specific faith works for you that is different from mine. Great! I am happy for you. Just allow me to acknowledge the Great Mystery as I see fit.Please E-mail me if you have questions or comments about this review.
