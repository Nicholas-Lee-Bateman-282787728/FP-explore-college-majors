1141008,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B0013D8LC2,Alex Udvary,"[59, 66]","The critics seem to enjoy beating up Woody Allen. ""Cassandra's Dream"" follows in the trend of the last 15 or so years of the public and critics turning their back on Allen and his films. I've found that they sometimes take cheap shots. It's one thing not to like an Allen film, but often I read personal attacks against Allen the man. Remarks are made concerning his age, personal life and his relationship with Soon-Yi. Rarely do critics stick to comments concerning editing, cinematography or acting without inserting a jab at Allen.Every review I've come across for this film has been negative. ""Variety"" did not like it, spending a majority of the review complaining about the characters accents and the language used in the film, citing it is not authentic if you are British. Roger Ebert did not like it nor did the Chicago Tribune while the New York Times seemed luke-warm to it.Once again however I find myself on the outside of public opinion. ""Cassandra's Dream"" is one of 2007's best films. Many may want to compare it to Allen's ""Match Point"", Allen's other film set in London revolving around murder and social class. Don't! The films are very different. ""Match Point"" I felt used metaphor in a more superior way. I thought Allen did a better job expressing his views on society in that film, but, ""Cassandra's Dream"" should not go without its due praise.The film follows two lower class brothers, Ian (Ewan McGregor) and Terry (Colin Farrell) trying to get by and climb the social ladder to success. Terry has a bit of a drinking and gambling problem. For now the gambling is paying off. Winning small amounts at cards and betting on the dog track. Ian on the other hand works at the family restuarant but dreams of investing in hotels. In many ways he wants to be like his rich uncle Howard (Tom Wilkinson), who has travelled all over the world.One day Terry's luck runs out, he losses big at a poker game and is 90 thousand pounds in debt. Where will he get the money? Ian has some money saved for his hotel investments but not 90 thousand pounds. Their only hope is their rich uncle.Before their uncle will give them the money he has a favor to ask. There is a whistle-blower at Howard's company who is going to testify against him for some questionable business moves he made. Howard needs the man to be, shall we say, eliminated. And he can only turn to his family for such a request.At the heart of Allen's film is what lies in men's souls. Are good people capable of bad things. The brothers may have their faults, but they are not criminals. The tagline line for the film is every dream has a price. It's key to the film. How far would you go to reach your dreams? How severely will we allow our moral judgement to punish us for ""sinful"" acts?We saw this question present itself in Allen's ""Match Point"" and ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" (which also had brothers planning a murder. In fact the original title for the film was ""Brothers"") .McGregor is good in the film as his character I felt was better defined and goes through more of a transformation. Farrell is the weak link of the bunch. His character seems underdeveloped. In honesty both characters could have used more work but McGregor adds something to the character through his presence as an actor. He makes the part more interesting then it was written. Farrell keeps his performance at the page level. Meaning he doesn't flesh the character out to make it his own but instead simply sticks to the page.The major acting find here is Hayley Atwell. She is a treasure playing Angela Stark, a love interest for Ian. She is an unknown actress who has the potential to be a star. Unfortunately Allen and his legendary Hungarian cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, whose credits include ""The Long Goodbye"", ""The Deer Hunter"", ""Blow Out"" and Allen's ""Melinda and Melinda"" don't linger on Atwell. Allen should have had the camera follow her more aggressively, making the camera and the viewer fall in love with her. But that may have changed the tone of the film.Zsigmond though for his part does get some beautiful country side shots as Allen shows as a different side of London than what we saw in ""Scoop"" and ""Match Point"". We see a more gritty side of London.The editing of the film I also found effective. It slowly builds tension. As I first began watching the film I thought to myself this is a ""good"" Allen film.  Then I slowly became more and mroe involved. How would the murder happen? Would they do it? Will they get away with it? How will such a film end? The film really grabbed my attention. My eyes became glued to the screen.Sure there are downsides to the film, some of the performances, I thought more could have been done with Atwell and I found the original score by Philip Glass, at times unsuccessful in creating the proper mood. I didn't think it added much to the film. I thought the best scenes were the ones without any music. But ""Cassandra's Dream"" is worth seeing. Yes the negative remarks will continue, but for me at least, I'm glad I saw this film.Bottom-line: One of 2007's best films. Despite some flaws Allen manages to keep his audience engaged. The film slowly creeps up on you.",4,London Murder Mystery,1200787200,"01 20, 2008",2008,5185,"['critics', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'beating', 'up', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Cassandra', 'Dream', 'trend', 'last',

1141009,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0013D8LC2,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","Okay, so Woody goes overseas (to London)in his role as director this time, gets two nice young working class brothers to commit to helping out dear old rich Uncle (he is family, after all) get rid of (for good, get it) a pesky member of his organization. The trials and tribulations (to speak nothing of the dialogue) are a little bit much as the two members of the gang who couldn't shoot straight are too far from Jersey to make this work, especially when one brother gets a little too remorseful for uncle and brother . What this film reminds me most of, in one sense, is that Woody is still conceptually conflicted about how Martin Landau got away with murder in Crimes and Misdemeanors and he wants to right the situation here. Given the material here the two brothers do okay but this is certainly not in the same league as C&M, which is arguably one of Woody's best works.",3,Still Looking For Woody,1223942400,"10 14, 2008",2008,879,"['Okay', 'Woody', 'overseas', 'London', 'role', 'director', 'time', 'two', 'nice', 'young', 'working', 'class', 'brothers', 'commit', 'helping', 'out', 'dear', 'old', 'rich', 'Uncle', 'family', 'get', 'rid', 'good', 'get', 'pesky', 'member', 'organization', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'speak', 'nothing', 'dialogue', 'are', 'little', 'bit', 'much', 'two', 'members', 'gang', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'straight', 'are', 'too', 'far', 'Jersey', 'make', 'work', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'brother', 'little', 'too', 'remorseful', 'uncle', 'brother', 'What', 'film', 'most', 'one', 'sense', 'Woody', 'still', 'conceptually', 'conflicted', 'how', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'got', 'away', 'murder', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'right', 'situation', 'here', 'Given', 'material', 'here', 'two', 'brothers', 'do', 'okay', 'certainly', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'C', 'M', 'arguably', 'one', 'Woody', 'best', 'works']",N/A

1141011,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0013D8LC2,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","Lately I've been indulging myself in a lot of classic and foreign films, so much so that I have been neglecting a lot of recent work that I would normally be biting at the bit to watch.Despite that though, I have found room for some.Beings that I have recently (okay, so it's been a few solid months now) fallen head over heals in love with Woody Allen I decided that I needed to see this film, despite its rather `under the radar' distribution (not to mention all of the `Allen attention' going towards his Oscar winning `Vicky Cristina Barcelona').  This is not Allen at his best, but it is not the disposable film some may have you believe it is.It's clever, intense, gripping and entertaining throughout.The story is told of two brothers who meet different ends of desperation.  Terry is wild and careless and winds up racking up quite a bit of gambling debts while Ian is a little more controlled and has his own set of particular aspirations but lacks the needed funds to make those dreams come true (and woo the girl he's grown to fancy).  The boys approach their uncle who is more than willing to give them the money, at a price.What follows is a morale play that pits brother against brother.  The boys uncle asks them to commit a crime; murder.  Terry, the reckless one reacts as one might have expected Ian to react.  He retreats.  He doesn't want anything to do with this bizarre request.  Ian on the other hand jumps in.  Sure, he doesn't want to kill a man, but he has seen his future and it is grand and he will do whatever is needed to grasp that said future in his hands.  The brothers feud over the mission, but what happens afterward, after the job is done so-to-speak, is what really forms the basis for the film.The acting is very good throughout, especially from the likes of Colin Farrell (who is having a great year, what with this, `In Bruges' and that well deserved Golden Globe win a few months back).  Farrell tackles his characters inner conflict and outward displays of depression brilliantly.  Ewan McGregor is an actor who I generally enjoy despite him never truly amazing me.  He nails this.  He perfectly compliments Farrell, engaging his characters lust for life masterfully.  The woman who share the screen with these men don't fare as well, not because they aren't great actresses but because the script is far less interested in them as it should be.  Hayley Atwell and Sally Hawkins are both stunning and engaging, but their characters are thinly developed; especially Hawkins who truly could have been `best in show' had she been given layers to work with.  Tom Wilkinson is only on screen for a short time, but he is always commanding and always astonishing and really should be in like every movie.The ending is tragic and appropriate to say the least.  I was caught off guard in a good way.  Woody Allen has been really working at bringing himself back into the good graces of cinema, and I think his recent string of films is doing just that.  Add this to the likes of `Melinda and Melinda'; Woody Allen light.Just goes to show you that if you are good at what you do you don't always have to best yourself in order to be great.",4,Finely constructed tale of conflicting moralities...,1235692800,"02 27, 2009",2009,3172,"['Lately', ""'ve"", 'been', 'indulging', 'lot', 'classic', 'foreign', 'films', 'so', 'much', 'have', 'been', 'neglecting', 'lot', 'recent', 'work', 'would', 'normally', 'be', 'biting', 'bit', 'watch.Despite', 'have', 'found', 'room', 'some.Beings', 'have', 'recently', 'okay', 'been', 'few', 'solid', 'months', 'now', 'fallen', 'head', 'heals', 'love', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'decided', 'needed', 'see', 'film', 'rather', 'radar', 'distribution', 'not', 'mention', 'Allen', 'attention', 'going', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'not', 'Allen', 'best', 'not', 'disposable', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'believe', 'is.It', 'clever', 'intense', 'gripping', 'entertaining', 'throughout.The', 'story', 'told', 'two', 'brothers', 'who', 'meet', 'different', 'ends', 'desperation', 'Terry', 'wild', 'careless', 'up', 'racking', 'up', 'quite', 'bit', 'gambling', 'debts', 'Ian', 'little', 'more', 'controlled', 'own', 'set', 'particular', 'aspirations', 'needed', 'funds', 'make', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'woo', 'girl', 'grown', 'fancy', 'boys', 'approach', 'uncle', 'who', 'more', 'willing', 'give', 'money', 'price.What', 'morale', 'play', 'brother', 'brother', 'boys', 'uncle', 'commit', 'crime', 'murder', 'Terry', 'reckless', 'one', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'expected', 'Ian', 'react', ""n't"", 'want', 'anything', 'do', 'bizarre', 'request', 'Ian', 'other', 'hand', 'jumps', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'want', 'kill', 'man', 'seen', 'future', 'grand', 'will', 'do', 'needed', 'grasp', 'said', 'future', 'hands', 'brothers', 'feud', 'mission', 'what', 'afterward', 'job', 'done', 'so-to-speak', 'what', 'really', 'basis', 'film.The', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'likes', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'who', 'having', 'great', 'year', 'what', 'Bruges', 'well', 'deserved', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'win', 'few', 'months', 'back', 'Farrell', 'characters', 'inner', 'conflict', 'outward', 'displays', 'depression', 'brilliantly', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'actor', 'who', 'generally', 'enjoy', 'never', 'truly', 'amazing', 'perfectly', 'Farrell', 'engaging', 'characters', 'lust', 'life', 'masterfully', 'woman', 'who', 'share', 'screen', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'fare', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'actresses', 'script', 'far', 'less', 'interested', 'should', 'be', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'are', 'stunning', 'engaging', 'characters', 'are', 'thinly', 'developed', 'especially', 'who', 'truly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'layers', 'work', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'only', 'screen', 'short', 'time', 'always', 'commanding', 'always', 'astonishing', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'like', 'movie.The', 'ending', 'tragic', 'appropriate', 'say', 'least', 'was', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'good', 'way', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'been', 'really', 'working', 'bringing', 'back', 'good', 'graces', 'cinema', 'think', 'recent', 'string', 'films', 'doing', 'just', 'Add', 'likes', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'light.Just', 'show', 'are', 'good', 'what', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'best', 'order', 'be', 'great']",N/A

(Merriam-Webster's definition of `conscience' is so spot-on as to be quote-worthy: `the sense or consciousness of the moral goodness or blameworthiness of one's own conduct, intentions, or character together with a feeling of obligation to do right or be good'--damn! that's good.)Some might say that Allen's 2007 film Cassandra's Dream is merely a repackaging of his 2005 Match Point--which was a repackaging of his 1989 Crimes and Misdemeanors; and the rebuttal would be, `well--yes and no'.It is true that in recent years Allen has cinematically abandoned the backdrop of New York City and its environs for that of London and the English countryside.And it is true that all three films deal with passion, death, and conscience.But we must grant that especially in the two recent films Allen's cinematic expression of youthful passion is evermore believably compelling; and in Cassandra's Dream Allen's portrayal of conscience is extremely well-drawn.Cassandra's Dream is moved along by a very good Anglo-Irish ensemble cast including Colin Farrell, John Benfield, Phil Davis, Sally Hawkins, and the brilliant Tom Wilkinson.*Match PointCrimes and Misdemeanors*",5,A Good Little Film...,1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,1613,"['*As', 'most', 'will', 'know', 'Allen', 'Konigsberg', 'Woody', 'Allen', ""n't"", 'make', 'big-budget', 'blockbusters.His', 'films', 'are', 'little', 'ensemble', 'casts', 'usually', 'distinctive', 'actors', 'virtually', 'more', 'filmed', 'stage', 'plays', 'attractive', 'backdrops.Which', 'dialogue', 'topoi.Allen', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'as', 'contrived', 'stilted', 'David', 'Mamet', 'Harold', 'Pinter.Which', 'Allen', 'preoccupation', 'recurrent', 'themes', 'passion', 'death', 'conscience', 'Merriam-Webster', 'definition', 'conscience', 'so', 'spot-on', 'be', 'quote-worthy', 'sense', 'consciousness', 'moral', 'goodness', 'blameworthiness', 'one', 'own', 'conduct', 'intentions', 'character', 'together', 'feeling', 'obligation', 'do', 'right', 'be', 'good', 'damn', 'good', 'might', 'say', 'Allen', '2007', 'film', 'Cassandra', 'Dream', 'merely', 'repackaging', '2005', 'Match', 'Point', 'was', 'repackaging', '1989', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'rebuttal', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'yes', ""no'.It"", 'true', 'recent', 'years', 'Allen', 'cinematically', 'abandoned', 'backdrop', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'environs', 'London', 'English', 'countryside.And', 'true', 'three', 'films', 'deal', 'passion', 'death', 'conscience.But', 'must', 'grant', 'especially', 'two', 'recent', 'films', 'Allen', 'cinematic', 'expression', 'youthful', 'passion', 'evermore', 'believably', 'compelling', 'Cassandra', 'Dream', 'Allen', 'portrayal', 'conscience', 'extremely', 'well-drawn.Cassandra', 'Dream', 'moved', 'along', 'very', 'good', 'Anglo-Irish', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'including', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'John', 'Benfield', 'Phil', 'Davis', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'brilliant', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', '*Match', 'PointCrimes', 'Misdemeanors*']",N/A

The film's score, by Philip Glass, is hit and miss- as often emotionally leading an audience by the nose as genuinely enhancing the film, a characteristic far too many Glass scores embody. The camera work by longtime Allen collaborator Vilmos Zsigmond is quite good. But, the writing is what sets this film apart from so many other routine `thrillers.' In a sense, Allen's problem with such a film reminds me of a similar problem that German director Werner Herzog had with his recent Vietnam War film, Rescue Dawn. So many critics focused on how its similarity in themes to earlier masterpieces by the director showed the later film up as inferior to the earlier ones that they missed out that the newer films were damned good on their own. Yes, Rescue Dawn is not as good, deep, and poetic as Aguirre: The Wrath Of God, and similarly Cassandra's Dream is not the almost perfectly crafted masterpiece that was Crimes And Misdemeanors, but so what? Both are outstanding films that, shorn of the comparisons, and if directed by artists other than Herzog and Allen, would have drawn unadorned raves. Also, it's helpful to note that the critics who dissed this film are the same folk who dissed the same earlier great Allen films when they came out, but who now hold them up as exemplars, only exemplifying the utter lack of critical acumen this essay's first sentence denotes.This film also provides a terrific showcase for Colin Farrell to show off his acting chops. Playing against type, he is the weaker of the two brothers, and he is excellent, showing that he is not mere female eye candy, and that turns in stinkers, like Oliver Stone's Alexander, are not the best he can do. Ewan McGregor is good, as usual, as are the girlfriends, Atwell and Hawkins. Wilkinson is solid as the uncle, but the film might have given him a bit more to do. As is, his character is only a plot device to propel the brothers on their journeys, although the fumbling delivery Howard makes, and his digressions on why he won't consider a professional contract, make the scene all the more believable.But, the film is so rich with great moments that detail character and plot, as mentioned earlier, that the screenplay could be used as an aid in screenwriting classes, for the film does trod over familiar Allen territory, but often with new twists and interesting asides which only deepen the resonance the film has. As example, after Ian meets Angela, he dumps his black girlfriend, Lucy, and a bit later, we see him callously telling his dad how special Angela is, and how much better and classier than any other girl he's dated she is. Lucy hears this, and the reaction she gives subtly lets us know how hurt she is and what an insensitive ass Ian is. There is also a scene where Ian questions Angela's ethic, by asking her if she'd sleep with a director to get a part, and she replies under what conditions she would. Ian, who has far weightier issues to deal with, seems stunned, but Angela puts him in his place by stating she gave the answers, but did not like the question. It's a small moment that shows that, while vain and egocentric, she does have a delineated ethical compass, and a penchant for giving as good as she gets- something many more one dimensional Allen sexpots lack. But, these are only two of a dozen or more such moments that enrich this film beyond mere `thriller' status.And while Terry and Ian ruminate a bit on ethics they are not the typical Allen eggheads hemmed in by their intellectual prowess and emotional impotence. Their collective nave-te is actually a bit refreshing, for when they repeat ideas hashed out in earlier Allen films (like the concept of `pushing a button' and someone is dead, borrowed from Crimes And Misdemeanors) or fixate on new ones (such as an addled Terry's claim that `It's always now!'- i.e.- the moment they committed murder) it is always in a different tone- one with more desperation, pathos, or stolidity- than before or expected. Also the fact that Allen, at several points, including the film's ending, seems to let the film settle into a groove that seems predictable, only to pull out the rug from under the viewers' expectations, lets the film maintain a tension and vigor it would otherwise lack. Viewers naturally desire clich&eacute;s, in an emotional sense, for the comfort, yet when the film resists it the momentary disappointment blossoms into attraction to the storyline's turn from the expected, for manifest clich&eacute;s invoke an intellectual resistance in a viewer, as well.All in all, Cassandra's Dream is an outstanding and acidic portrait of family and crime, and one that was shamefully dismissed, when not neglected, by the idiotic elitists that populate the critical consensus that dominates film reviewing. Go against the grain, seek out this film on DVD, and let it work within you as well as on you.",4,Good,1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,4964,"['DVD', 'Genius', 'LLC', 'features', 'save', 'few',

1141020,A3K51Z8GYTWAEE,B0013D8LC2,"Danniray99 ""Danniray""","[12, 12]","Woody Allen's ""Cassandra's Dream"" is a tightly-wound fable about the morality and consequences of overweening ambition. Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell star as two working-class brothers who start out with outsized dreams but end up with a wealth of troubles wrought by obsessive social climbing. Ian (McGregor) passes himself off as a high-rolling property investor/developer, largely to impress his paramour, an alluring actress with a wondering eye (Hayley Atwell), while Terry (Farrell) sinks into the mire of compulsive gambling. In their desperation to finance their respective endeavors, the brothers turn to a wealthy uncle (Tom Wilkinson), who in turn extracts a deadly Faustian bargain from his nephews. Like 2006's ""Match Point,"" ""Cassandra's Dream"" is yet another in a string of movies that are propelled by Woody Allen's lifelong fascination with class, morality (especially as it is defined or interpreted by the socially prominent) and the resulting friction.  As with ""Match Point,"" ""Cassandra's Dream"" has a spine-tingling, thriller-like urgency that quickens and intensifies as the story moves along.

1141021,A2B6Q78Z6T3UNX,B0013D8LC2,Dean Monti,"[0, 0]","(with spoilers) Casting was excellent. Phillip Glass score added to tension. Beautifully shot.Premise was compelling -- not new, but in talented hands this premise could pay off big.Somewhere in the reviews someone mentioned that the film may have needed another subplot .I might agree, but I also think --for this vehicle -- the stakes were not convincing.  It seems most of the tension is created by the angst caused by the idea of committing murder (and the angst falls more heavily on Colin Farrell, and that element is interesting). Somehow, however, in the structure of building this -- I wasn't convinced in the decision. Colin Farrell's character's back was presumably against the wall, but only in terms of the threat of anticipated violence (&#34;they will break your arms and hurt your family, etc), although we never see this get to the next level. We never see any actual threat, or the equivalent of a horse's head in his bed. It seems a big stretch to bring the brothers to agree to murder -- but if murder becomes an option, then why not murder (or rob)  the one you owe money to? Or murder or rob someone else to gain monetarily. What was missing for me was one or two extra levels that would have convinced me that murder was the *only* option left to the brothers in this situation. There is not even a Strangers on a Train, &#34;criss cross&#34; situation, ie; I did this evil thing for you and now you're obligated to do it for me.  Family is Family is the tagline for this movie. If Woody is trying to say that the brothers were obliged to do this out of family duty, then I think the uncle should have been portrayed as much closer, loving even. A bond portrayed as so strong that it overpowers the brothers' reservations. The uncle came off as cold. And even that could have worked, if the film had gone in another direction. I think this would have been a much more interesting psychological film if the brothers *failed* to commit murder. Or perhaps Allen was trying to create an In Cold Blood scenario, wherein neither brother could have done it independently, but when they come together, the act comes to pass. I was surprised when the murder happened. Not because it was shocking, but because, for me, it forced a very predictable ending that would leave both brothers dead. I was hoping for a better twist on it all.  Woody Allen has been extraordinarily perceptive about human behavior and motivations. He's also taken basic source material (other classic films and tropes) and recycled them into gold. But here something's gone amiss. And *because* of that, I think it's a film worth watching, particularly if you are a fan of Woody Allen's work or want to analyze film structure and its elements.  If you look at the breadth of material over Allen's career, serious forays into stories involving murder and intrigue (like Match Point and Crimes and Misdemeanors)  have worked well. It's not as if he can't create effective serious films and should stick to comedy. That's nonsense. Here he had all the elements but not a strong script.  The film is saved, somewhat, by the overall direction (look, sound, and feel) and by the performances, which are worth watching, although the dialogue remarkably weak by Woody Allen standards and is not saved (as it might have been) by the STORY.  The message I got after watching Cassandra's Dream is not &#34;hang it up, Woody,&#34; or &#34;stick to comedy.&#34; The message I get is that genius and creative risk-taking is fallible.  And that's a lesson worth knowing, particularly for artists. Risk-taking allows the artist to go outside the comfort zone and try different approaches. Scorsese, Hitchcock, Kurosawa, Bergman... they all have notable failures in their canons by trying something *other* than what they have been successful with. The same is true of Miles Davis, Pablo Picasso... it's all part of a process. Let's allow genius and risk-takers to have an interesting miss once in a while. It keeps them searching, and, history has shown, often produces a new, greater success.",3,fallibility and creative risk-taking,1405036800,"07 11, 2014",2014,4064,"['spoilers', 'Casting', 'was', 'excellent', 'Phillip', 'Glass', 'score', 'added', 'tension', 'Beautifully', 'shot.Premise', 'was', 'compelling', 'not', 'new', 'talented', 'hands', 'premise', 'could', 'pay', 'off', 'big.Somewhere', 'reviews', 'someone', 'mentioned', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'needed', 'subplot', '.I', 'might', 'agree', 'also', 'think', 'vehicle', 'stakes', 'were', 'not', 'convincing', 'most', 'tension', 'created', 'angst', 'caused', 'idea', 'committing', 'murder', 'angst', 'more', 'heavily', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'element', 'interesting', 'Somehow', 'however', 'structure', 'building', 'was', ""n't"", 'convinced', 'decision', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'character', 'back', 'was', 'presumably', 'wall', 'only', 'terms', 'threat', 'anticipated', 'violence', '34', 'will', 'break', 'arms', 'hurt', 'family', 'etc', 'never', 'see', 'get', 'next', 'level', 'never', 'see', 'actual', 'threat', 'equivalent', 'horse', 'head', 'bed', 'big', 'stretch', 'bring', 'brothers', 'agree', 'murder', 'murder', 'option', 'then', 'why', 'not', 'murder', 'rob', 'one', 'owe', 'money', 'murder', 'rob', 'someone', 'else', 'gain', 'monetarily', 'What', 'was', 'missing', 'was', 'one', 'two', 'extra', 'levels', 'would', 'have', 'convinced', 'murder', 'was', '*only*', 'option', 'left', 'brothers', 'situation', 'not', 'even', 'Strangers', 'Train', '34', 'criss', 'cross', '34', 'situation', 'ie', 'did', 'evil', 'thing', 'now', ""'re"", 'obligated', 'do', 'Family', 'Family', 'tagline', 'movie', 'Woody', 'trying', 'say', 'brothers', 'were', 'obliged', 'do', 'family', 'duty', 'then', 'think', 'uncle', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'portrayed', 'much', 'closer', 'loving', 'even', 'bond', 'portrayed', 'so', 'strong', 'brothers', 'reservations', 'uncle', 'came', 'off', 'cold', 'even', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'film', 'had', 'gone', 'direction', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'psychological', 'film', 'brothers', '*failed*', 'commit', 'murder', 'perhaps', 'Allen', 'was', 'trying', 'create', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'scenario', 'wherein', 'brother', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'independently', 'when', 'come', 'together', 'act', 'pass', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'murder', 'happened', 'Not', 'was', 'shocking', 'because', 'forced', 'very', 'predictable', 'ending', 'would', 'leave', 'brothers', 'dead', 'was', 'hoping', 'better', 'twist', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'been', 'extraordinarily', 'perceptive', 'human', 'behavior', 'motivations', 'also', 'taken', 'basic', 'source', 'material', 'other', 'classic', 'films', 'tropes', 'recycled', 'gold', 'here', 'something', 'gone', 'amiss', '*because*', 'think', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'particularly', 'are', 'fan', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'work', 'want', 'analyze', 'film', 'structure', 'elements', 'look', 'breadth', 'material', 'Allen', 'career', 'serious', 'forays', 'stories', 'involving', 'murder', 'intrigue', 'Match', 'Point', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'have', 'worked', 'well', 'not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'create', 'effective', 'serious', 'films', 'should', 'stick', 'comedy', 'nonsense', 'Here', 'had', 'elements', 'not', 'strong', 'script', 'film', 'saved', 'somewhat', 'overall', 'direction', 'look', 'sound', 'feel', 'performances', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'dialogue', 'remarkably', 'weak', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'standards', 'not', 'saved', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'STORY', 'message', 'got', 'watching', 'Cassandra', 'Dream', 'not', '34', 'hang', 'up', 'Woody', '34', '34', 'stick', 'comedy.', '34', 'message', 'get', 'genius', 'creative', 'risk-taking', 'fallible', 'lesson', 'worth', 'knowing', 'particularly', 'artists', 'Risk-taking', 'artist', 'go', 'comfort', 'zone', 'try', 'different', 'approaches', 'Scorsese', 'Hitchcock', 'Kurosawa', 'Bergman', 'have', 'notable', 'failures', 'canons', 'trying', 'something', '*other*', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'successful', 'same', 'true', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'Pablo', 'Picasso', 'part', 'process', 'Let', 'allow', 'genius', 'risk-takers', 'have', 'interesting', 'miss', 'once', 'while', 'searching', 'history', 'shown', 'often', 'new', 'greater', 'success']",N/A
1141022,A3GD923K1K602I,B0013D8LC2,"Dix88 ""Love Ocean""","[1, 1]","Brilliant acting by all the actors. This film is strong, in points funny, but it is mainly a deep, family tragedy. Other than &#34;Sleeper,&#34; it's my favorite Woody Allen play.SPOILERS!!!Terry & Ian are brothers (played by Colin Farrell & Ewan McGregor). Their father (John Benfield) owns a restaurant where Ian works as a manager. Terry is a car mechanic & is addicted to gambling. Ian borrows fancy cars from Terry's customers to show off for women.The two buy a boat, putting in money together but then Terry wins big on a dog race & pays the boat off. They name her &#34;Cassandra's Dream.&#34; Enter greek mythology. Cassandra was cursed by Apollo (god of light/enlightenment) so that she had the gift of prophecy but no one believed her. She went mad.In one scene of &#34;Cassandra's Dream,&#34; party goers are discussing Greek tragedies. Ian's girlfriend Angela lauds &#34;Medea&#34; as her favorite. But then she makes the mistake of saying Clytemnestra is her favorite character in that play (Clytemnestra is in Electra).Ian is so madly in love with Angela (Haley Atwell) that he pretends to be a big shot hotelier (with hotels in California).Terry gets into deep trouble by gambling--he was on a big winning streak so joins in a super high stakes poker game. He loses & ends up owing 90,000 pounds. I think that comes out to around $180,000 US. So both brothers are desperate for money.Their Uncle (played by Tom Wilkinson) is the &#34;hero&#34; of the family. Ian's & Terry's Mum (Clare Higgins) goes on & on about his successes, to the chagrin of the father. Talking of Electra!!!  It's kind of like &#34;Death of a Salesman&#34; in this regard, with Willy Loman's brother the hero.So it's a bit of a shock when the brothers find out that Uncle Howard is in deep trouble, he's done some shady deals (not fully described) & he also is desperate. The man who can testify & have him put into prison must be &#34;done away with&#34; and he happens to be in town right now (London).At first, Terry is absolutely against it. He is the voice of reason. Cassandra. They will be doomed if they do that bad deed. &#34;It's against God.&#34; But he loves his fiance&eacute; deeply & she wants to buy a little semi-detached house. He also must have money to get away from the loan sharks. Ian insists that they would likely break his legs or do worse, which terrifies Terry.The brothers really do love each other. Many feverish, whispered conversations about should they do it, should they not. Sort of Hamlet in that sense.Just by weird, Woody Allenesque chance, they meet the intended victim at wrap party for a show Angela was in. The look on Colin Farrell's/Terry's face is brilliant when he realizes the guy is coming up to chat with him.It's a tragedy of errors from then onward. The music by Phillip Glass sets a moody backdrop as the brothers do the deed. Ian is able to let it go, water off a duck's back almost.Terry is haunted, dreams of the dead man, has horrible nightmares, begins talking to himself, loses his job. His fiance&eacute; calls Ian, frantically worried about Terry's mental health. He truly is going mad.Ian just wants to go to California with Angela. He tries to talk Terry into opening up a sports shop with the money Uncle Howard has given them in exchange for the killing. But Terry's soul is pierced. He shows up at a garden party, disheveled, drunk (another of his weaknesses), weeping & tells Ian he is turning himself in to the police. He says &#34;we crossed a line. we went against God.&#34; Ian says &#34;God? God?  What God?!!&#34; and looks over his shoulder as if God were listening in. I love that touch---is there a God & if so, is he right here, watching us?Ian tells Uncle Howard about Terry's plan to confess to the police. Uncle Howard says they have to &#34;take care of&#34; Terry. Ian is in shock. Face full of doom.But he does make arrangements to get rid of Terry. Goes to Terry's place, tells him they need some sea air, a get away, just the two of them, sailing in Cassandra's Dream. While Terry is telling his fiance&eacute; about the plans, Ian steals Terry's pills (codeine & something else, another of Terry's weaknesses). He crushes pills up & puts them into an evelope. Brings them onboard. Tries desperately to get Terry to change his mind about confessing the crime. When Terry is unchangeable, Ian goes below to put the pills into a beer. But he can't do it. He smashes the beer bottle, then angrily goes upside & confront Terry violently. They scuffle & Ian falls down the stairs, onto a hard table & dies.Flash to cops talking about the two: &#34;One killed the other or it was an accident, then the one killed himself&#34; (or words to that effect).Meanwhile, the girls are shopping merrily.

1141023,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B0013D8LC2,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[0, 2]","One might wonder why Woody Allen has become so fascinated with setting his modern-day morality plays in England, rather than the US.  Perhaps it is the enduring illusion of innocence or nobility that British accents still hold for we Americans: watching Ewan McGregor wrestle with the decision to commit murder is more unsettling than the moral struggles of Alan Alda in earlier Allen flicks, because Ewan has that cute little accent.  Of course, human nature is human nature, and an accent won't serve as a get out of jail free card -- it'll just throw the audience off balance for a little while.On the face of it, Allen's 2007 film, ""Cassandra's Dream,"" is very much like ""Match Point from a couple of years earlier.  In it, a handsome young Londoner wrestles with the decision to murder someone after realizing the the murder will (apparently) grant him his every desire. The struggle is primal and Biblical, and the audience gets queasy at the sight of such an elemental wrong being played out, methodically, under our very eyes.  However, ""Match Point"" was a more skillful and alluring film -- although there are some differences, ""Cassandra"" feels very much like an alternate draft of the same story, or even a workshop for the earlier film.  Apparently, cold-blooded homicide (this time with a Cockney accent) is a theme that Woody Allen is not quite ready to let go of, even if his audience may feel that they have already traveled down this road before.Ewan McGregor and co-star Colin Farrell turn in fine performances, with an able supporting cast, but still this morality play may have trouble connecting.  Allen loyalists might enjoy seeing him direct another strong crime genre work, however, since it is interesting to see something that feels so completely un-Woody Allen-like, even if it does feel a bit redundant.

1141025,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0013D8LC2,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 7]","There's an oddly pinched tone to Woody Allen's 2007 noirish morality tale about the evil men are willing to do for the elusive things they can't have. Still in exile in London for his third film in a row across the pond, Allen has made a film that is recognizably his own even although he is nowhere to be seen this time. You can tell by the clean cinematography courtesy of Vilmos Zsigmond (Close Encounters of the Third Kind), the dialogue-rich scenes, and the parable-like way the story unfolds as if it was a contemporary take on a classic Greek tragedy. In this respect, the film immediately recalls Allen's 2005Match Point, but this time, the moralistic perspective clamps down the dramatic angle as the narrative takes a well-trodden path. The title refers to a small sailboat much sought after by two working-class brothers. On the surface, older brother Ian is the prototypical good son who works at his father's struggling restaurant out of familial devotion.Younger brother Ian, however, has an addictive personality - whether it's gambling, alcohol or pills - that makes him the object of ridicule and scorn by his parents. We soon discover that both are really the opposite of what they appear. By casting Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell as Ian and Terry, Allen appears to be switching the roles one would associate with the actors' screen personas. The usually gallant McGregor plays the cool Machiavellian one, while the cocksure Farrell is the nave, guilt-ridden one. Thanks to Terry's lucky betting streak, the brothers get the boat and quickly get in over their heads. Ian needs funding in order to invest in a chain of high-end hotels in California, while Terry racks up insurmountable gambling debts. Just in time, the family success, their well-heeled Uncle Howard shows up, and the brothers waste little time in asking him for money since Howard has been helping their parents for years. The central plot twist comes as Howard is willing to help the boys upon the condition that they kill a colleague that could destroy him in the midst of a pending investigation into his clinic business.How the plot evolves is pretty standard, and Allen appears to have trouble keeping it all reasonably suspenseful. The problem is that Terry's emotional breakdown is dragged out amid the contrived plot twists until the somewhat ironic ending. While Tom Wilkinson is dependably compelling in his few scenes as Uncle Howard, the rest of the performances are variable in quality. McGregor captures the ambition of his character, but he is not nearly as convincing when Ian's desperation turns malevolent. Farrell is comparatively more surprising as Terry as he shows his character's budding conscience with conviction. It's too bad Allen's screenplay lets him fester in his guilt for so long. Newcomer Hayley Atwell lacks the range to play Ian's actress girlfriend Angela as anything more than a spoiled beauty.

L'hoir,"[1, 2]","Colin Farrell and Ewan MacGregor turn in stellar performances as brothers in ""Cassandra's Dream,"" a stark tragedy which demands that its protagonists choose between loyalty to family and the right thing to do; and because of their respective failings, they become enmeshed in a net from which there is no escape.It is clear that Woody Allen is not out to please the average movie-goer (nor should he necessarily), because throughout the film he alludes to Greek tragedy in general. By beginning slowly--perhaps a bit too slowly--and then tightening the screws of the plot, Allen takes his characters to the critical moment where they have a choice, and then, after a final twist when they pass the point-of-no-return, he begins to loosen his grip on the plot as the action unwinds to its logical, but ironic conclusion.Allen also alludes specifically Aeschylus' ""Oresteia""--the tragedy of murder within the family; blood-begetting-blood; and its resultant guilt and madness. The very title, ""Cassandra's Dream,"" alludes to Aeschylus' drama; for in a state of madness, Cassandra--with the gift of prophecy that no one believes--foretells the murders that are about to take place within the house. In a similar manner, Allen's opening and closing camera shots that focus on the boat named ""Cassandra's Dream,"" both foreshadow and look back on murder for which the viewer, like the Greek chorus, is unprepared.This is not Allen's only subtle use of irony in the context of tragedy: In mid-film, when the aspiring actress, who is in love with one of the brothers, meets a serious theatre director, who confides that Euripides' ""Medea"" is his favorite tragedy, she betrays her lack of theatrical gravitas by replying that yes, Clytemnestra is her favorite character. Since Clytemnestra is not in ""Medea"" but in the ""Oresteia,"" Allen indicates that she will likely not get the part and the opportunity which she so desperately craves.""Cassandra's Dream"" is a difficult film to watch, but then so is Aeschylus' ""Oresteia,"" the only difference being that the latter tale of murder, set in ancient Argos, offers the theatre-goer the comfortable distance of some two-and-a-half millennia, while the former, set in modern-day London, is too close for comfort.",4,Cassandra's Nightmare,1219449600,"08 23, 2008",2008,2248,"['Colin', 'Farrell', 'Ewan', 'MacGregor', 'turn', 'stellar', 'performances', 'brothers', 'Cassandra', 'Dream', 'stark', 'tragedy', 'protagonists', 'choose', 'loyalty', 'family', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'respective', 'failings', 'become', 'enmeshed', 'net', 'escape.It', 'clear', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'not', 'please', 'average', 'movie-goer', 'should', 'necessarily', 'film', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'general', 'beginning', 'slowly', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'too', 'slowly', 'then', 'tightening', 'screws', 'plot', 'Allen', 'characters', 'critical', 'moment', 'where', 'have', 'choice', 'then', 'final', 'twist', 'when', 'pass', 'point-of-no-return', 'loosen', 'grip', 'plot', 'action', 'logical', 'ironic', 'conclusion.Allen', 'also', 'specifically', 'Aeschylus', 'Oresteia', 'tragedy', 'murder', 'family', 'blood-begetting-blood', 'resultant', 'guilt', 'madness', 'very', 'title', 'Cassandra', 'Dream', 'Aeschylus', 'drama', 'state', 'madness', 'Cassandra', 'gift', 'prophecy', 'one', 'murders', 'are', 'take', 'place', 'house', 'similar', 'manner', 'Allen', 'opening', 'closing', 'camera', 'shots', 'focus', 'boat', 'named', 'Cassandra', 'Dream', 'foreshadow', 'look', 'back', 'murder', 'viewer', 'Greek', 'chorus', 'unprepared.This', 'not', 'Allen', 'only', 'subtle', 'use', 'irony', 'context', 'tragedy', 'mid-film', 'when', 'aspiring', 'actress', 'who', 'love', 'one', 'brothers', 'serious', 'theatre', 'director', 'who', 'Euripides', 'Medea', 'favorite', 'tragedy', 'lack', 'theatrical', 'gravitas', 'replying', 'yes', 'Clytemnestra', 'favorite', 'character', 'Clytemnestra', 'not', 'Medea', 'Oresteia', 'Allen', 'will', 'likely', 'not', 'get', 'part', 'opportunity', 'so', 'desperately', 'Cassandra', 'Dream', 'difficult', 'film', 'watch', 'then', 'so', 'Aeschylus', 'Oresteia', 'only', 'difference', 'being', 'latter', 'tale', 'murder', 'set', 'ancient', 'Argos', 'theatre-goer', 'comfortable', 'distance', 'two-and-a-half', 'millennia', 'former', 'set', 'modern-day', 'London', 'too', 'close', 'comfort']",N/A

With every new movie he's made there are complains that Woody lost it and would never create anything as great as some of his best films of the 70s and 80s. It is a good thing that Allen does not seem to care and keeps releasing year after year the films that are still among the best the industry has to offer. I've seen every picture Allen has made, and I said in one of my reviews, ""Woody Allen makes good, very good, and great movies"". Even if I don't love all his movies equally, they are all good, there is something (often - a lot) to enjoy in every single one. His latest, ""Cassandra's Dream"" is not an exception. This is a tale of two London brothers, Ian (Ewan McGregor) and Terry (Colin Farrell), who are good friends and have been very close since their childhood. At one fateful moment of their lives they both would face an inevitable choice of how far they would go to get what they want and what price they would pay. I found both McGregor and Farrell terrific and they had a very believable chemistry together. Tom Wilkinson, as the successful and wealthy American uncle/Mephistopolis who seduces the nephews with a terrifying yet promising offer is wonderful as always. I happened to read a few critical reviews before I watched the film and after I finished it, I couldn't help thinking if it was the same movie we saw? Yes, once again, Allen meditates on the eternal subject of Crime and Punishment and he comes up with the superb script, confident directing, and as a result - a gripping and thrilling film that is as much a crime movie as it is about family values, loyalty, choices, doubt, guilt, and regrets. The film is beautifully shot by great Vilmos Zsigmond (McCabe & Mrs. Miller, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, The Deer Hunter, The Black Dahlia, Images, The Long Goodbye, and Melinda and Melinda}, and the original dramatic unsettling score is composed by Philip Glass. As you can see, there is a lot to enjoy in the Allen's movie of 2007 which I see as one of the best of the last year.

His London trilogy which started out brilliantly with Match Point and degenerated with Scoop ends here with Cassandra's Dream, which averages out the two.The movie unfolds like a play, much like Scoop, and from the start, you feel that both our leads feel like (gasp) actors.  The self conscious nuances that Woody brings to his characters sometimes creates a sharp contrast from the flat, ordinary style of filming.  There's nothing fancy in terms of Woody's camerawork (often times, it felt like watching an older BBC tv drama) and he relies completely on the actors and the script to drive the story.The story of two brothers and confidantes and their inevitable moral dilemma of how to pursue a better destiny echoes Match Point, so much so that you wonder why Woody is revisiting the same riff.  Cassandra's Dream could well play on stage - I imagine somehow that Woody was inspired by visiting the theatre in the West End when he conceived this.Collin Farrell provides the more interesting and tortured character, but somehow the usual ironies and humour of Allen's wit are missing in Cassandra's Dream and in the end we get a not quite thriller / drama, devoid of the usual quirks we've come to love of this director.Certainly watchable but those interested in this vein of Woody may want to check out Crimes and Misdemeanours or even Manhatten Murder Mystery.

In this Woody Allen movie (thankfully he's not in it; his tics and neuroses have long since worn thin) Farrell is a pill-popper, chain-smoker, alcoholic, compulsive gambler, and a lovable [...] with a conscience. His brother is brighter but has a pie in the sky mentality.The brothers, both needing money, go to their rich uncle, Tom Wilkinson, in a part that should have been fleshed out more, for dough, but he in return wants them to be his hit men to get rid of a whistle blower.The two men are like clowns as they go through their plans to get rid of the uncle's enemy. It's almost farcical as they fail in one attempt. Both actors are extremely good in their roles. A moral dilemma is presented, but the story doesn't quite sound credible. Farrell, very likable, has to teeter on the edge of caricature.It's filmed in stunning sunlight with glorious views of London and the countryside which looks idyllic until you get into the minds of the two brothers who are trapped by their own ambitions and flaws. ""The New Yorker"" featured the DVD in its May 26, 2008 edition. The piece says that Allen's purpose is ""to depict life as cruel, grim, and doomed"" with ""a hopeless view of existence."" Because the two brothers are so cloddish in their planning and because they seem so lacking in real guile, I don't think the movie is quite that grim.Cassandra, after all, was the Trojan prophetess whose correct predictions were not believed because she had spurned Apollo.

I particularly enjoyed Philip Glass' moody score and Colin Farrell's skillful turn as the guilt-ridden brother who can't live with the crime he and his sibling commit for monetary gain. Colin, by the way, is clearly the ""good"" brother here (or, at least, the less bad one), and only considers the crime because he needs to pay off loan sharks, not because he wants to make some easy money, which is closer to the motivation of the brother chillingly played by Ewan McGregor.If there's a slight downside to the story, it's the predictability of the message: crime doesn't pay.  Other Woody Allen movies have you walking out of the theater debating the actions and decisions of the central characters.  In this one there's nothing to debate.  Two brothers cross the line and everything soon spirals downward for them.

I am perhaps one of the few that does with the exception of the main stream world of critics who fawn all over any and everything he does. Such is the case with this film that many have found wonderful.The story takes place in Britain and revolves around two brothers. Ian (Ewan McGregor) is a young man who wants better for himself. At present he is stuck running his father's restaurant while his father recovers. His sights are set higher than this though, planning with a new friend to invest money in a real estate deal in California.Terry (Collin Farrell) on the other hand is content with life in his home town. Always on the lookout for more money, Terry has a severe gambling problem. When he wins, he wins big, but then he turns around and sends it all back as well as more than he can afford to pay back.The brothers work hard and do their best, always wishing for better. When both find themselves in need of substantial cash, their prayers are answered with the arrival of their uncle Howard (Tom Wilkinson). Howard is a success, having made tons of money in the states as a doctor. They know he can afford to help them, the question is will he?After a reunion at dinner, the boys get their chance alone with Howard. They put forth their question of cash and he replies with an offer for them. It seems he has gotten himself into some trouble with his books and business practices and needs them to do him a favor in return for his giving them the money they need. He needs them to kill someone.The movie revolves around this issue from there on out. The brothers, intensely loyal to one another, banter about the prospects of doing this deed but suffering from it morally. While Ian wants to go for it, Terry has doubts and concerns, mostly involving guilt. But go for it they do and afterwards nothing will ever be the same.Reading what I've written, this actually sounds like a good movie. Too bad that it involves far too much dialogue and characters that for me seemed like cardboard cutouts as opposed to real people. The talking is nonstop and repeats the same things over and over and over again. This doesn't yield insight, it merely makes the clock continue ticking for a lengthier film. Also, the fact that two brothers raised together could have such differing viewpoints on life and guilt rang false with me.Worst of all was I never found myself caring for either of these brothers. One seemed a ruthless enough that he thought only of himself. The other was a milquetoast who whimpered about too much and took no responsibility for his own actions.

It has a lot of the elements of ""Match Point"" but it does not quite rise to that level.  The essential reason for that is that the audience is asked to buy into two successive choices that our lead character has to make.  The writer/director has certainly done a good job of making his case for those two choices.  However, many might buy into the first one but the second one may have been a choice too far.  As a result it will, for many, end up as a film that does not fully relate to the viewer.The acting is very good, the directing is excellent and the movie approaches the level of a thriller.  After the movie was over, I was left quite impressed with the irony of the ending.  As I thought about it the next day, I realized the depth of the irony that I hadn't comprehended the night before.

1141055,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B0013D8LC2,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[0, 0]","Woody Allen is perhaps best known for his comedies, but lately, he has been making films that are reflection on our humanity and morality.  To me personally, this film is almost a continuation of the ""Match Point"" film.  Set in Europe (England) we get to know two brothers, young and handsome, uneducated but eager to make it big in the world.  Both are hustlers.  One gambles in poker and on dog races, while the other pretends to be hotelier while he is helping his father in the family restaurant.  Unable to keep the charade about their well set life, one gambles too much and gets in trouble with the local loan sharks while the other gets tangled in the love affair with the girl that is beyond his means.  In order to make money they both so desparately need, they agree to kill for hire and their paying customer is no one else but their own uncle.Can these two drifters and small time thiefs adopt themselves to the fact that they are now murderers?  How will that affect their lives and their relationship?  Can money take care of everything, even conscience?I still do not understand why Allen had this story setup in the lower class London when it could be set anywhere.  Cockney accent was hard to follow at times and two brothers in their stupidity do look like two silly boys; in spite of the awful things they've done they look like two fools.  Good casting, but a bit too pretentious.  This is not by any means Dostoyevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"".  Aspirations are high, but these two characters are too superficial, uneducated and greedy to get (me at least) pitied for their actions.",3,Murder mystery or morality tale?,1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,1603,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'comedies', 'lately', 'been', 'making', 'films', 'are', 'reflection', 'humanity', 'morality', 'personally', 'film', 'almost', 'continuation', 'Match', 'Point', 'film', 'Set', 'Europe', 'England', 'get', 'know', 'two', 'brothers', 'young', 'handsome', 'uneducated', 'eager', 'make', 'big', 'world', 'are', 'hustlers', 'One', 'gambles', 'poker', 'dog', 'races', 'other', 'pretends', 'be', 'hotelier', 'helping', 'father', 'family', 'restaurant', 'Unable', 'keep', 'charade', 'well', 'set', 'life', 'one', 'too', 'much', 'trouble', 'local', 'loan', 'sharks', 'other', 'tangled', 'love', 'affair', 'girl', 'means', 'order', 'make', 'money', 'so', 'desparately', 'need', 'agree', 'kill', 'hire', 'paying', 'customer', 'one', 'else', 'own', 'uncle.Can', 'two', 'drifters', 'small', 'time', 'thiefs', 'adopt', 'fact', 'are', 'now', 'murderers', 'How', 'will', 'affect', 'lives', 'relationship', 'Can', 'money', 'take', 'care', 'everything', 'even', 'conscience', 'still', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'Allen', 'had', 'story', 'setup', 'lower', 'class', 'London', 'when', 'could', 'be', 'set', 'anywhere', 'Cockney', 'accent', 'was', 'hard', 'follow', 'times', 'two', 'brothers', 'stupidity', 'do', 'look', 'two', 'silly', 'boys', 'spite', 'awful', 'things', ""'ve"", 'done', 'look', 'two', 'fools', 'Good', 'casting', 'bit', 'too', 'pretentious', 'not', 'means', 'Dostoyevsky', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'Aspirations', 'are', 'high', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'too', 'superficial', 'uneducated', 'greedy', 'get', 'least', 'pitied', 'actions']",N/A

The whole murder and mystery thing in London that has been his main theme since Match Point and Scoop is getting a bit boring. Match Point was good and got him his best reviews in twenty years. However it was too similar to a section of Crimes and Misdemeanors, the last film that got him those rave reviews, in which a man has an affair and then plots to kill his mistress. Cassandra's Dream is different as it tells the story of two brothers who find themselves desperate and  in need of cash. The Blaine brothers are two working class lads who  need  a large amount of money and quick. Terry (Colin Farrell) is a mechanic with a gambling problem who has just lost big at the track and owes some dangerous people . Ian (Ewan McGregor) works at their dad's restaurant out of pity but dreams of finding the right girl and opening his own chain of hotels. One day while driving in the countryside he meets a pretty actress and begins to woo her. He can't afford to buy her affections however so he too needs money. The boy's Uncle Howard (Tom Wilkinson) is rich and has always come through for the family before. When he arrives in town each brother presents their case to him and asks him for the money. Howard isn't prepared to just give it to them like he has done before. He wants a return on his investment. A former business partner is set to testify against him in an upcoming trial. The testimony could land him in jail for the rest of his life where he would not be able to access his money and be useless to the boys. He wants the man taken care of as he explains it. Terry is shocked to hear this and immediately refuses to participate in a murder. Ian on the other hand  makes it his duty to convince his brother that this is their only way out of their current predicament. The rest of the film concerns the brothers plotting and going through with a murder and the consequences of their actions. What happens to Terry makes this film somewhat unique and is certainly  unexpected. Farrell and McGregor are quite good and Tom Wilkinson is perfect as the rich uncle who is sympathetic one moment but menacing and dangerous the next. It has some good things going for it but ultimately it gets boring because it is repetitive.

1141059,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0013D8LC2,RMurray847,"[3, 4]","A few years ago, you may remember, Colin Farrell was touted as a hot young up-and-comer...a great actor with great looks.  Someone who would be a movie star at any moment.  Farrell then proceeded to ""star"" in a number of movies that the public was not interested in, such as THE NEW WORLD, ALEXANDER and THE RECRUIT.  The soul-less MIAMI VICE was the bottom.  It made some money, but Farrell was so uninteresting in it (and seemed so uninterested)...his moment of glory was done.A few years ago, you may remember Ewan McGregor was a hot young up-and-coming star, after turning on critics with TRAINSPOTTING and striking a chord with Americans in a one-episode appearance on the smash hit TV show ""ER.""  He was about to be a star.  Well, he too starred in some movies no one wanted to see, such as DOWN WITH LOVE and STAY (although his natural charm and charisma never let him look bored.)  He was arguably the best thing in the new STAR WARS movies, but he got lost in all the hand-wringing over how bad they were.  His star faded.For many years, in good movies and bad, Woody Allen has written great roles for women, including Oscar winning and nominated parts great and small.  Have Diane Keaton, Mia Farrow, Judy Davis, Dianne Wiest, etc. ever been better than when working with Woody?  But his star faded too.  Each year, he churned out another clunker (MELINDA AND MELINDA, ANYTHING ELSE?).  He still had big roles for women, but no one cared that Tea Leoni  gave a tart performance in HOLLYWOOD ENDING.A couple of years ago, Allen turned his attention to London, and suddenly there appeared MATCH POINT, his best movie in years.  Emily Mortimer and Scarlett Johanssen gave highly praised performances...but I couldn't help noticing that the best performance came from Jonathan Rhys-Meyers.  The next year, in London again, came the minor comedy SCOOP, which at least managed to be more funny than some of his more recent work.  Johanssen again was okay, but ironically it was Allen's most amusing acting in awhile.  And then came CASSANDRA'S DREAM.There are women in this film, and they are all quite okay.  But this is an ACTOR'S film...and suddenly we are reminded that Colin Farrell and Ewan McGregor are actually capable of truly moving performances, complex, flesh-out, lived-in and believable.  They are not afraid to play genuinely flawed people.  Allen has given them lots of rich dialogue to work with, and they RIP into it with gusto.They play brothers who are always a bit down on their luck.  McGregor works in his father's restaurant, but dreams of ""making it big"" with some sort of get rich quick scheme or another.  He clearly has no head for business, but he wants to be rich, move to California and show off.  He also wants to impress a beautiful actress he's in love with who he's made THINK he's all these things.  Farrell is a mechanic who spends most of his time winning at gambling and even more of it losing.  Both brothers are clearly addicted to the idea of fast, easy money...even if they recognize that these desires are flawed.Both of them find themselves needing more money than they can possibly lay their hands on.  And into their lives comes their very rich uncle (Tom Wilkinson...oozing easy menace in a way that Sidney Pollack would have done in an American film.)  He wants to help them...but in return they must do something for him that is pretty horrible to contemplate.Will they compromise their morals?  If they do, will they be able to live with what they've done?  Will money bring them happiness?Allen has grappled with these themes before, and there's not really any new moral territory being explored.  But the London setting has finally freed Allen's writing from sounding just like a film by...Woody Allen.  McGregor and Farrell bring their own cadence to the dialogue, and they have both dug deep into their portrayals...so they sound like real people and not just Allen concoctions.The movie builds some real tension.  As the brothers face what they are considering doing, we truly feel some of the tension they do.  We are sometimes appalled by them, but we always root for them.  Neither of these actors would have expected to be renewed as movie stars with this film...but they saw a chance to renew their stature as actors.  And both men succeed very well indeed.  (And Farrell went on next to the superior, totaling gripping IN BRUGES...one of my favorite movies of 2008.)The story comes to a rushed and disappointing conclusion...clearly grabbing to come off as Greek tragedy but most seeming lazy...as though Allen just didn't know how to wrap it all up.

Zwick,"[6, 7]","***1/2Whenever he turns to drama, Woody Allen always seems to wind upchanneling either Ingmar Bergman (""Interiors,"" ""September"") or FyodorDostoevsky (""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" ""Match Point""). ""Cassandra'sDream"" finds him in one of his Dostoevsky moods (with traces ofHitchcock thrown in for good measure), once again making the case that it isboth impossibly difficult and ridiculously easy for the common man toengage in cold-blooded murder.Colin Farrell and Ewan McGregor star as two working-class brothers whohave fallen onto financial hard times (one is a compulsive gambler, theother a frustrated cipher with dreams of rising above his station botheconomically and romantically). Desperate for some immediate cash, theyreluctantly agree to knock off one of their wealthy uncle's businessrivals who has some secret knowledge that, if it ever got out, couldsend the old man up the river for a very long time.Set in London, ""Cassandra's Dream"" is not as sharp and cutting as someof Allen's previous works in this genre, but thanks to strongperformances by Farrell, McGregor and Tom Wilkinson as the uncle, thislatest update of the Loepold-and-Loeb story manages to keep ourinterest most of the way.

Paul Simon sang ""Every year we throw a hero up the pop chart"" (or words to that effect). True, American audiences only love for a short time; they get restless and ask for more, mostly more of the same. The French, they've been civilized longer; they have more patience.When an artiste pulls off a brilliant life of creativity, people, mostly Americans, get restless. Long ago a sage social observer called Americans 'spiteful spectators'(or words to that effect) wanting more; better, bigger too. All 'tall dark'critiques here are valid. But mostly because today's works don't have the gilt of newly-discovered creativity. Fresh/new trumps familiar/anything's.That said, YWMATDS is kinda lame from concept through execution. All visible and agreed upon by Amazon viewer/fans (only two or three of his films garnered as low as three stars). Maybe now's the time to say Woody Allen's always had a kinda cynical, pessimistic take on love, relationships, the wars of the sexes: Love is desperately, clumsily seeking to fill a void? A scary thought for many.In most cases Woody's lover character loves himself more than his (or her) love object. This film makes the lover a restless romantic who doesn't love so much as wants a male heir (okay, a spoiler, but not really pivotal) and for erecting a Viagra rush. A new role for drama dynamo Anthony Hopkins, portraying a dithering, fickle oldster, fumbling and swept along.(Kudos on him for so ably, aptly depicting an adrift namby-pamby oldster sans cliches)Maybe from the sum of Allen's incredible life's work some sage can delineate a theme that makes a complete statement. It'll present the human condition, egotistical, unsure, comically hungry, for both genders; with love as an excuse to be taken seriously, to not be alone, to somehow win out in the cacophony of human transactions.I collected all Woody's films. Think I'm going to take those I'm most drawn to and see them end to end. HANNA'S SISTERS, DECONSTRUCTING HARRY, HUSBANDS AND WIVES, ANNIE HALL and on for maybe eight-ten films. Then see this tall dark stranger anti-romance latest vehicle.Allen is certainly today's Chaplin. When it comes to pop charts, no matter the competition over the decades, Woody Allen will be near to the top. Enjoy/learn from elements you relate to, ignore those you don't.

McGregor is impossible to dislike in any role, which puts the audience sorely to the test here where his actions are completely amoral. It continues in the darker mode of Woody Allen's London-based films, but is never less than interesting. The tone is unusual as well, not being a thriller, really, but somehow remaining at a distance from reality, even though everything is set up quite convincingly in terms of motivation and psychological development.

1141064,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B0013D8LC2,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[2, 6]","After exiting a year thriving on depressingly dark dramas, Woody Allen's newest film Cassandra's Dream can easily be compared to Sydney Lumet's Before the Devil Knows You're Dead and of course Allen's 2005 venture Match Point. Even though the acting is sensational and the constant production of suspense nearly flawless, the storyline is a bit too habitual territory for Allen, and resultantly Cassandra's Dream feels like a film we've all seen before.Ian (Ewan McGregor) and Terry (Colin Farrell) are brothers from a modest London family who work hard and play hard at a restaurant and a mechanic shop, respectively. Ian is even-tempered and composed, and has high hopes of investing in hotels in California, while Terry lives by the moment and enjoys the risky stakes of gambling on dog races and poker. When Terry gets himself in a financial bind, the two young men turn to their wealthy Uncle Howard (Tom Wilkinson), a millionaire businessman who seldom visits but often looks after the brothers when money is concerned. This time however, Howard is in dire need of Ian and Terry's help - a pesky witness in a detrimental case against Howard's company is in bad need of being silenced. Murder was never something the boys figured themselves capable of, but after Howard's persistence and their desperation for quick funds, the two contemplate committing the dastardly crime.Opening with the perfect murder music by composer Philip Glass, Cassandra's Dream carefully sets up the development of Ian and Terry and their stable but careless lives, and builds up tension as details fall into place. After the introduction of Howard's dilemma, the suspense becomes nerve-wracking and wonderfully paced, mixing in Hitchcockian surprises and guilt-laden twists. Despite the slow yet intriguing setup, the conclusion may leave many viewers decidedly disappointed.The acting stands out above the progression of the story as Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell appear purposefully cast against their usual character types. Ewan is collected and plotting, while Farrell marvelously portrays the brother that succumbs to self destructive guilt. Tom Wilkinson also delivers a superb supporting performance as a man with a discordant aura of noblesse oblige that coerces the once reasoning brothers into attempting an act they would otherwise be unable to do. If it weren't for the engrossingly outstanding performances by the entire ensemble, Cassandra's Dream would barely be able to surface from the sea of other similarly bleak films submerged in downward spiraling, despondent protagonists.Beautifully cynical dialogue encourages many laughs toward the unpredictable denouement, and a thick fog of foreshadowing lingers around most of the striking words. ""You won't be sorry,"" pressures Howard, and ""Ain't life grand,"" quote the brothers from Bonnie and Clyde, a film that mirrors tragic consequences. Allen seems to say that the guilt of men fuels just as many bad decisions as greed and desperation, and Cassandra's Dream becomes a tense waiting game of actions and consequences.Great acting and very solid direction still aren't able to dissuade the tone, mood and overall feel of the film from being too familiar. While the story demonstrates an inventive twist on a classic formula, it somehow feels like we've seen it all before, and with Woody Allen's continuous explorations of different genres and characters, it's a shame that Cassandra's Dream is more Match Point than Scoop.- Mike Massie",3,Cassandra's Dream Movie Review,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,3490,"['exiting', 'year', 'thriving', 'depressingly', 'dark', 'dramas', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'newest', 'film', 'Cassandra', 'Dream', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'compared', 'Sydney', 'Lumet', 'Devil', 'Knows', ""'re"", 'Dead', 'course', 'Allen', '2005', 'venture', 'Match', 'Point', 'Even', 'acting', 'sensational', 'constant', 'production', 'suspense', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'storyline', 'bit', 'too', 'habitual', 'territory', 'Allen', 'resultantly', 'Cassandra', 'Dream', 'feels', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before.Ian', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Terry', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'are', 'brothers', 'modest', 'London', 'family', 'who', 'work', 'hard', 'play', 'hard', 'restaurant', 'mechanic', 'shop', 'respectively', 'Ian', 'even-tempered', 'composed', 'high', 'hopes', 'investing', 'hotels', 'California', 'Terry', 'moment', 'risky', 'stakes', 'gambling', 'dog', 'races', 'poker', 'When', 'Terry', 'financial', 'bind', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'turn', 'wealthy', 'Uncle', 'Howard', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'millionaire', 'businessman', 'who', 'visits', 'often', 'brothers', 'when', 'money', 'concerned', 'time', 'however', 'Howard', 'dire', 'need', 'Ian', 'Terry', 'help', 'pesky', 'witness', 'detrimental', 'case', 'Howard', 'company', 'bad', 'need', 'being', 'silenced', 'Murder', 'was', 'never', 'something', 'boys', 'figured', 'capable', 'Howard', 'persistence', 'desperation', 'quick', 'funds', 'two', 'contemplate', 'committing', 'dastardly', 'crime.Opening', 'perfect', 'murder', 'music', 'composer', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'Cassandra', 'Dream', 'carefully', 'up', 'development', 'Ian', 'Terry', 'stable', 'careless', 'lives', 'up', 'tension', 'details', 'fall', 'place', 'introduction', 'Howard', 'dilemma', 'suspense', 'nerve-wracking', 'wonderfully', 'paced', 'mixing', 'Hitchcockian', 'surprises', 'guilt-laden', 'twists', 'slow', 'yet', 'intriguing', 'setup', 'conclusion', 'may', 'leave', 'many', 'viewers', 'decidedly', 'disappointed.The', 'acting', 'stands', 'out', 'progression', 'story', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'appear', 'purposefully', 'cast', 'usual', 'character', 'types', 'Ewan', 'collected', 'plotting', 'Farrell', 'marvelously', 'brother', 'self', 'destructive', 'guilt', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'also', 'superb', 'supporting', 'performance', 'man', 'discordant', 'aura', 'noblesse', 'oblige', 'once', 'reasoning', 'brothers', 'attempting', 'act', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'unable', 'do', 'were', ""n't"", 'engrossingly', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'entire', 'ensemble', 'Cassandra', 'Dream', 'would', 'barely', 'be', 'able', 'surface', 'sea', 'other', 'similarly', 'bleak', 'films', 'submerged', 'downward', 'spiraling', 'despondent', 'protagonists.Beautifully', 'cynical', 'dialogue', 'many', 'laughs', 'unpredictable', 'denouement', 'thick', 'fog', 'foreshadowing', 'lingers', 'most', 'striking', 'words', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry', 'Howard', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'life', 'grand', 'quote', 'brothers', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'film', 'mirrors', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'Allen', 'say', 'guilt', 'men', 'fuels', 'just', 'many', 'bad', 'decisions', 'greed', 'desperation', 'Cassandra', 'Dream', 'tense', 'waiting', 'game', 'actions', 'consequences.Great', 'acting', 'very', 'solid', 'direction', 'still', 'are', ""n't"", 'able', 'dissuade', 'tone', 'mood', 'overall', 'feel', 'film', 'being', 'too', 'familiar', 'story', 'inventive', 'twist', 'classic', 'formula', 'somehow', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'continuous', 'explorations', 'different', 'genres', 'characters', 'shame', 'Cassandra', 'Dream', 'more', 'Match', 'Point', 'Scoop.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A

The millionaire asks the duo ""What is your favorite Greek tragedy?"" Yes, let's ignore for a moment the fact that this type of dialogue just doesn't come up in normal conversation. Some of the references are more overt than others, but Allen intends ""Dream"" to be a modern sort of Greek tragedy, a retelling of his favorite fable.Ian (McGregor) and Terry (Colin Farrell) are brothers, each with tremendous financial problems. Early in the film, they manage to scrape together some money and buy a small sailboat. After the refurbish it, they christen it ""Cassandra's Dream"" and set sail. Later, their financial troubles have only deepened; Terry is a gambler and is now 90,000 pounds in the hole, Ian wants to escape working at their parent's restaurant and invest in a business deal to start some hotels in California. When he meets Angela, an aspiring actress, his goals become all the more enticing.

When Uncle Howard comes for a visit, the boys ask him to help out. Uncle Howard agrees, but it appears he isn't as saintly as Ian and Terry's mother believe and he needs some help; a former business associate is threatening to divulge some secrets about Howard's business dealings, threatening his business and livelihood. He needs his nephews to kill the informer. I mean, they are asking for a lot of money, again, so it seems like a fair exchange.Eschewing the relationship- based comedies and the slapstick derived shenanigans he is best-known for, Allen revisits the sort of shady moral ambiguity he plumbed so memorably with ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" and the more recent ""Match Point"". The only problem? ""Cassandra's Dream"" is nowhere near as good or memorable as these other two entries. This leads me to the other oft-noted comment about Woody Allen's films. In the last decade or so, for every good film, there can be two or more films that are mediocre or just plain excruciatingly painful films he subjects his fans to. ""Matchpoint"" was a near great film, showcasing a writer - director with great material and a cast to match. That film was followed by ""Scoop"", a dreadful excuse for a `funny' film, starring Scarlet Johansson and Hugh Jackman. ""Dream"" isn't as bad as ""Scoop"", but it is a long way from ""Matchpoint"".One of the key problems with ""Dream"" is everyone talks, a lot. Ian talks about his potential business deal and needing money for that. Then he meetsAngela and they talk about moving to California together. Ian talks with Terry about Terry's gambling. Terry talks with Ian about his gambling debts. We get it. They have money problems. Ian talks about his unhappiness with his life, he doesn't like working at his family restaurant and wants to escape to California. He talks about this with Terry, he talks about this with his dad, he talks about this with his mom, and he talks about this with Angela. Then, his father brings up Ian's grand ambitions, which have been problematic in the past. Many times. After Uncle Howard makes his request, Ian and Terry have many conversations about murdering his business associate; Ian seems to have little problem with the idea, Terry has a lot of problems with it. But they both need money. And then discuss why they need the money again.Interrupting these numerous and varied discussions, the two brothers take their newly refurbished boat out, they murder a man, and later, they take the boat out again.Many filmmakers have made their careers crafting films using a lot of well-written, bordering on clever dialogue throughout. Allen himself has been known to create dialogue for his characters giving them a comedic spin, making them memorable. But Allen is also guilty of writing dialogue in his voice, varying it little, despite the age, economic status or sex of the character. In many of the director's best films, the sheer number of characters he has floating throughout the story masks this problem. Most of his best films have at least half dozen well-known actors playing various parts, usually more. This gives all of the characters the opportunity to absorb these awkward lines, while waiting for the chance to utter the funny and memorable dialogue he is best known for. But when he makes smaller films, with fewer characters, the problem becomes amplified. In ""Dream"", the majority of the dialogue is between Ian and Terry, or between one of the brothers and their significant others. So when they say things like ""Oh, my God, I feel so self-conscious right now"", you almost want to laugh because we half expect this to be an amusing line spoken by one of Allen's signature characters, the type he often plays and models after our image of him. The filmmaker's years of analysis and self-reflection have always played a part in his work. But in ""Dream"", he has no doppelganger, no stand-in. So when a young twenty-something actress says a line similar to this, it feels phony and contrived.Also, the two brothers address each other by name, a lot, when talking to one another. I don't know about you. But when I am having a conversation with one other person, I rarely use their name, and only when I am trying to emphasize what I am saying. Because Terry and Ian do this so much, it is almost as though Allen is trying to keep track of who is speaking his dialogue.""Matchpoint"" is a very similar film, yet a more successful one. In that film, the two main characters faced a moral dilemma together and their actions led the story. In ""Dream"", the two brothers face an unpleasant task together, yet one of them is clearly very bothered about his part of the task, while the other seems more put out by his brother's reluctance to complete the required actions. So, they talk about it, and one brother tries to convince the other. And they talk some more. And then talk some more.The two leads do their best with the dialogue. While McGregor seems the most comfortable with the awkward lines and excessive dialogue, Farrell is more successful at creating his character. Terry is the black sheep of the family and a gambler. Riding the roller coaster accompanying this type of addiction, he is overjoyed one day and morose the next. When their Uncle asks them to murder a potentially harmful business associate, you might expect him to have the easier time accepting the chore ahead of them. But he struggles with the moral dilemmas associated with this task, tossing and turning as he sleeps. Farrell is able to make Terry seem weaker and more vulnerable.McGregor's Ian falls for Angela, a glamorous actress, early in the film. Before this, Ian is desperate to raise some money to invest in a new business deal in California, to escape the dungeon that is their parent's restaurant. After he meets Angela, he seems more determined to make this happen, to make her more interested in him. What actress wouldn't want to move to California, to be closer to Hollywood and stardom? But despite some off-hand references by his father, we never get a feeling for how and why Ian is able to so easily go ahead with his Uncle's request. I understand he will get money and be able to make the business deal a reality, but just listening to people talk about these things doesn't help to make them visually interesting.Tom Wilkinson plays Uncle Harold and while he is interesting to watch, this happens more because you keep waiting for some subtle hint of his true diabolical nature. When he reveals what he wants his nephews to do, it's diabolical, for sure, and he is desperate, desperate for this potential source of harm to go away. But the actor never gives us a brief glimpse of something else, something lying beneath the surface.In fact, that is pretty much the problem with the entire film; there is nothing below the surface and because of all of the talk, nothing is really visually interesting.",2,Allen's Nightmare Becomes His Fans,1201737600,"01 31, 2008",2008,8405,"['realized', 'something', 'watching', 'Cassandra',

Their concerned father (John Benfield), owner of failing restaurant, is of no help. But they have an uncle (Tom Wilkinson), rich, kind, and successful, and the brothers are happy to hear Uncle Howard is about to visit London. However, Uncle Howard has his own problem and asks Ian and Terry to do some favor for him.What Uncle Howard wants the brothers to do should not be revealed here, but perhaps you have already guessed. Woody Allen's ""Cassandra's Dream,"" which some people compare with Sidney Lumet's ""Before the Devil Knows You're Dead"" is a kind of crime story that you might expect from the creator of great ""Crimes and Misdemeanors."" Unfortunately, the characters' moral dilemma in ""Cassandra's Dream"" looks less convincing and the conclusion more unsatisfactory.Both Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell deliver strong performance, though they can hardly look like brothers. The well-acted film has supports from talented players like Sally Hawkins and Hayley Atwell, but their characters remain somewhat underwritten.Fast-paced ""Cassandra's Dream"" benefits from Vilmos Zsigmond's photography and Philip Glass's moody score, but I am afraid Allen's Dostoevsky-like crime tale never resonates with audiences in quite the same way as ""Match Point"" or some of his earlier works.",3,Slick and Engaging But Lacks Emotional Resonance,1272844800,"05 3, 2010",2010,1395,"['Ian', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Terry', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'are', 'brothers', 'need', 'money', 'desperately', 'different', 'reasons', 'concerned', 'father', 'John', 'Benfield', 'owner', 'failing', 'restaurant', 'help', 'have', 'uncle', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'rich', 'kind', 'successful', 'brothers', 'are', 'happy', 'hear', 'Uncle', 'Howard', 'visit', 'London', 'However', 'Uncle', 'Howard', 'own', 'problem', 'Ian', 'Terry', 'do', 'favor', 'him.What', 'Uncle', 'Howard', 'brothers', 'do', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'revealed', 'here', 'perhaps', 'have', 'already', 'guessed', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Cassandra', 'Dream', 'people', 'compare', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'Devil', 'Knows', ""'re"", 'Dead', 'kind', 'crime', 'story', 'might', 'expect', 'creator', 'great', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'Unfortunately', 'characters', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'Cassandra', 'Dream', 'less', 'convincing', 'conclusion', 'more', 'unsatisfactory.Both', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'deliver', 'strong', 'performance', 'can', 'hardly', 'look', 'brothers', 'well-acted', 'film', 'supports', 'talented', 'players', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'characters', 'remain', 'somewhat', 'underwritten.Fast-paced', 'Cassandra', 'Dream', 'benefits', 'Vilmos', 'Zsigmond', 'photography', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'moody', 'score', 'am', 'afraid', 'Allen', 'Dostoevsky-like', 'crime', 'tale', 'never', 'audiences', 'quite', 'same', 'way', 'Match', 'Point', 'earlier', 'works']",N/A

Two working class brothers find themselves in some money troubles (one lost 90 thousand pounds playing pocker, another needs extra money to continue supporting his expensive love interest). They turn to their rich uncle for help. Uncle is supportive enough, but needs a favor in return. This favor is to kill a whistle-blower in his company who could ruin the uncle's business and reputation. The rest of the movie shows the brothers' doubts about the murder and their lives after it.As you can see, the story is interesting and has a lot of potential.

1141068,AY8WZDYR79GFV,B0013D8LC2,Yasha Banana,"[3, 18]","Dear Mister Allen,Woody my boy!  Woody my boy!  How many times have I, Yasha J. Banana at 96-years-old, the oldest living Amazon movie reviewer; if you call this living), how many times have I told you -- schtupping young gals and then making movies that preach morality -- not for you, boychick.  I mean, we all know what happened a few years ago and, not to bring up unpleasant memories, but from *you* we need a morality tale?I don't think so.Personally, I like your older movies, the funny ones.  Your first one was great ""Nem Di Gelt"" -- ""Take the Money and Run.""  What a peppy-perky flicker that one was.But of course my all-time favorite was ""Bananas.""  For weeks people came up to me.  ""Yash -- what? -- this movie is about your family?""  So, what did it hurt, I lied.  ""Sure,"" I told them, ""from me he got all his material.  The little cocker couldn't have done it without me.""Movies about families, now that's what I like.  On Broadway I went to see ""Cats.""  I had such high hopes.  With all the Jews in show business, I thought it was a story about a family named Katz.So who knew?I'm expecting funny lines, like, ""What do you call a woman who sleeps with cats?"" ... ""Mrs. Katz.""Instead I get a bunch of crazy people running around on stage.  Jumping, spinning, tumbling, spritzing.  The chorus boys had costumes on that were so tight I not only could tell who was circumcised and who wasn't, I had a good idea whose pediatrician was named ""Lefty.""And the girls.  Hoy boy!  The tukases on those girls were so tight you could bounce silver dollars off them.  Which I would have gladly done, even though I'm on a fixed income.All that running around and carrying on.  Jumping from furniture, crashing into walls.  I got *such* a headache; you wouldn't wish it on an Arab.  Cats jumping on each other, cats running over fences, cats making dates.  And, trust me, there were homosexual cats on that stage, believe me.Not that I make judgments, mind you.  A person wants to be a faygala, he should live and be happy.  I make no pronouncements.But all those noisy, jumping cats.  It was too much.  I had a cat in my apartment once.  Ran all over the place.  Drove me crazy.  So I took him to the vet, got him fixed.  After that -- didn't make a sound, hardly moved at all.  All he did all day long was stare at me.  The quiet I liked, but the guilt, oy vey, it was awful.  After a while I gave him to the Italians across the hall and asked them to drown him.But anyway, what do you care about my cat?  Back to you and your career, Woody; if I may. ...Personally, I, Yasha J. Banana -- nonagenarian, hat blocker, and one-time towel boy at Plato's Retreat -- I categorize your movies into two groups: ""Whine-Whine-Whine,"" and ""Preach-Preach-Preach.""  The thing is, preaching is easy; also, not to embarrass you but, as previously noted, in your case it's rather inappropriate, don't 'cha think?  Whining, on the other hand, now there's where you excel!  Such whining in your movies I never heard in my life.  Then again there was my second wife, but let's not dwell.Believe me, that's your bread and butter, boychick -- whining.  That's what pays the electricity bill.  That's what puts the Manischevitz on the table.But in this flicker, ""Cassandra's Dream,"" I didn't hear any whining at all.  Not a peep.  Not a titter. ...Tits. ...That reminds me of that runaway titter in the movie you made way back when, ""Everything You Wanted To Know About Sex But Who Knew Already?""  Now that was funny.  I laughed so hard I wet my pants.  Which nowadays is the highlight of my day.A giant runaway tit.  Reminded me of my fourth wife.  Big gal.  But cold as a witch's you-know-whats.  And I'm talking cold.  After we left our honeymoon suite they renamed the waterbed ""The Dead Sea.""(Right after Henny Youngman checked out.)Big, what am I saying?  She was FAT!  Boy, was she fat!... She was so fat she used to sing, dance and do total eclipses.... She was so fat in case of enemy attack, she immediately went into combat as a hay silo.... She was so fat she made Orson Welles look like a mere slip of a lad.... She was so fat, you know that song ""Shake Your Booty"" -- when she shook her booty the entire Mormon Tabernacle Choir had a premature ejaculation.Fat, lemme tell you fat.  For the first six months of our marriage I thought I was having intercourse with her, until I realized I was schtupping one of her folds.But nowadays, sex, forget about it.  At 96-years-old, who can bother?  A few years ago though I met a beautiful young woman.  She cooked for me, she kept house for me and she made mad, passionate love with me.  Then I went out for a newspaper and forgot where I lived.(Ba-da-bing-bing!)So look, anyway, back to your facockta movie.  What's it about -- that crime doesn't pay?  Are you serious?  You've notified the ganefs on Wall Street about this?  George Bush has taken this advice to heart, has he?Nothing personal, boychick, but morality tales from you I find hard to accept.  From Mother Theresa a morality tale would be a big hit.  From Francis of Assisi, as far as I'm concerned, that goy can preach until the cows come home.  Even John-Boy on ""The Waltons,"" what a philosopher.  But you, Woody?  Come on, be serious.  Your preaching morality would be like Jesse James checking my brother-in-law's books.Anyway, listen, who am I to throw stones?  Personally, I've been married five times.  But never to someone I had to help with her homework already.(Ba-da, bing-bing!)Okay, so I stole that joke from George Burns.  What's he gonna do, rise from the dead and sue me?Meanwhile, back to ""Cassandra's Dream.""  If I may. ...I mean, I don't get it, in the whole movie I'm waiting for some shiksa named Cassandra to show up, but where is she already?  I missed her when I went out to take a pee?  Listen, I'm entitled, if you had a prostate like mine, as big as a Spaulding basketball, you'd be writing and directing from the toilet, Mister Big Shot Feency-Schmeency Hollywood Maven.Frankly, I've had it with you, Woody Allen!  I'd didn't want to mention this but you stole my act.  I'm speaking a factual truth now.  When I was a young fellow, I was a nebbish, too.  And a much bigger one than you, believe me.  And did I make a nickel from it?  No sir!  No-sir-no-sir-NO-SIR!  All that cocking around you do, and from that you make a living?  From that they pay you millions?  When I was a nebbish, I made peanuts.  I was a ""'mon back.""  I stood in back of a truck and said: ""'mon back, `mon back.""Okay, so I stole that joke from you.  Who stole it from Henny Youngman.  Who stole it from Milton Berle.  Who stole it from Jimmy Hoffa.  So you'll serve a paper and ~ sue me ~ sue me ~ what can you do me? ~ Give a holler and hate me ~ hate me ~ go `head and hate me.~You like my singing voice?  I'm available, you know.  You cast your next movie and you're maybe looking for a 96-year-old talent, I'm your man.  I sing, I dance, I tell jokes.  And if there are any dead spots in your next script, I'm no Danny Kaye but I'm a pretty good tummler.  Peppy, perky -- I used to be a big hit in the lobby at Grossinger's waiting for a room.  I had all the widows in stitches.  Knock-knock jokes coming out of my ears.So if you need me for your next movie, all kidding aside, I'd be honored.Now, as for my terms. ...1.)  Naturally, I'll need a dressing room.  Not too big; but not too small either.  I may have shrunk but I'm no Billy Barty.2.)  An autographed picture of Steve Guttenberg.  (For my niece, Tiffany Banana.)3.)  I'll need at least two young, nubile personal assistants to help me memorize my lines, assist me in finding my way to my hotel room and keep me from falling asleep.4.)  A wheel barrel full of Viagra.  See term #3.5.)  A little gelt.  Preferably in cash.6.) A top-notch makeup artist.  Your makeup person knows what they're doing?  Because for me makeup may take longer than Mel Gibson's speech before B'nai B'rith.7.)  Air-conditioning.  Indoors and out.8.)  In the morning I'd like a bagel, a cup tea and a nice piece cake.
