Benjamin Pratt leads as the chief of the Wildfire project. Christa Miller proves her days at Scrubs were not wasted.A U.S. government satellite crash lands near Piedmont, Utah, and two teenagers find it and bring it back to town. The town's inhabitants open it and release a deadly microorganism, which is later codenamed Andromeda by the United States Army. A team is sent from the Army's bio-defense department to retrieve the satellite, only to die from the disease themselves. General George Mancheck (Andre Braugher), the head of the bio-defense department, who activates ""Wildfire,"" a team of five scientists who are called upon when high-level bioterror threats occur in the United States. The team, headed by its creator Dr. Jeremy Stone (Bratt), investigate Piedmont. They retrieve the satellite and rescue a hysterical 60-year old man and a colicky baby who have survived the Andromeda outbreak. Cable news reporter Jack Nash (Eric McCormick)becomes aware of some of the events related to the fallen satellite and Andromeda. As he investigates further, Chuck Beeter, the Director of the NSA, uses General Mancheck's aide, Colonel Ferrus, to perform assassinations to prevent knowledge of Andromeda from reaching the civilian population. Nash travels to one of the Army bases performing the quarantine, and sees the effects of Andromeda - now using multiple vectors of travel - spreading. He also becomes a target of assassination, but manages to escape Ferrus and his subordinates.This production is DULL and over technical.

Based on Michael Crichton's fine novelThe Andromeda Strain, the suspense thriller was a wonder of subtlety and restraint, guided by one of the greatest directors in history Robert Wise (The Haunting,The Day the Earth Stood Still). There was not necessarily room for improvement, but additional layers could have been added to the growing menace of a team of isolated scientists attempting to identify a deadly alien virus that has landed on earth.I was genuinely looking forward to this 2008 TV miniseries remake, especially with Ridley and Tony Scott serving as executive producers. Sadly, as the film played out, I realized with intense frustration the filmmakers had no confidence in the source material. I was aghast and mortified at the dramatic license taken. Multiple subplots were added above ground (the scientists are isolated in an underground government lab), including a TV reporter attempting to uncover the plot, a governmental conspiracy stretching to the Pentagon and an accidental nuclear explosion. In addition, the virus now causes victims to become homicidal maniacs. This film is a perfect example of modern-day filmmakers having complete disrespect for today's audiences.It's ironic that the only good moments in this film are those below ground where the team of scientists attempt to understand the virus (the only scenes faithful to the original). The additional fluff is derivative and uninspired. There is not a moment of believability in the new subplots and after the first two hours, most viewers familiar with the source material will be profoundly insulted. Filmmakers, including director Mikael Salomon and writer Robert Schenkkan, made a conscious choice to add violence, explosions and second-rate soap opera in an attempt to appeal to what they believe is a dumb audience interested in such crap. They have purposefully moved the action out of the laboratory and away from the scientific process in order to create tired action movie dramatics.There's some good actors in this cast, Benjamin Bratt, Rick Schroder and Andre Braugher, but their roles are so weak they eventually disappear in the mindless subplots lifted from other, better films. Sadly, the original ""The Andromeda Strain"" has been cheapened by this shockingly bad miniseries, which steers for clumsy thrills rather than suspense. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen, an unspeakable waste of three hours of my life.I've decided to re-watch the original film to wash away the depressing stench of this atrocious remake.

The writing and direction convey not an ounce of urgency.  No one on the Wildfire A-team rounded up by the government seems even remotely shocked or disturbed by the 99% mortality rate of a mysterious new disease!  When a top surgeon is first told about this microbial juggernaut she smirks and says, ""Gee, you always have such good news for me.""  Then the two go on to chit chat about petty family problems.The cynicism of these characters is truly stupefying.  If you have ever watched a few science documentaries, particularly those dealing with public health, you will know that real scientists are often driven by deep emotions and passions.  Dullards like those found in ""The Andromeda Strain (2008)"" exist only in the lazy minds of subliterate hack writers.Please note that the recent SARS outbreak six years ago had a mortality rate of about 10%!  Our CDC and health agencies all over the world went into hight gear to understand the disease and to check its progress.  In this crummy flick - which so earnestly throws around scientific lingo to establish credibility - the field of epidemiology is reduced to a cheap soap opera.Good science fiction must be grounded in reality.  The only way to put science-based heroism up on the screen is to first understand the heroism of real scientists.

Set predominantly in a sealed underground research bunker which could be cauterized by a Nuclear blast should the threat of contamination become too great, the film boast a cast of virtual unknowns, a weirdly atonal electronic score by Gil Mell&eacute;, an uncomfortably claustrophobic, tense atmosphere and some splendid use of abstract shot-framing and split-screen. There was very little in the way of action, big explosions and histrionics and it remains a faithful adaptation of Crichton's book (which, if you've never read it, is one of his best and one of the most splendidly ominous and worryingly authentic first-contact novels ever written.)This made for TV remake was apparently co-produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, but given it's tone and timbre, it might just as well have been produced by Michael Bay.And I don't mean that as a compliment.From the outset, the audience is beaten over the head with CGI and bombast; the research virologists are now all forty and under, impossibly good-looking and fit and of a racial mix hardly seen outside of Benetton commercials; Humvees seem to cram the frame every two minutes; gunfire and explosions break out with sporadic abandon and we are treated to more impassioned histrionics that one would generally expect to see in an episode of ""The Bold And The Beautiful"" - seriously, I kept waiting for Ridge to stagger through the bunker (which seems to be perpetually lit like the chill-out room of a nightclub) and demand to see Stephanie and Taylor.Oh yeah, then there's the virus itself. It's no longer just an extra-terrestrial virus - now its also sentient, telepathic and has come through a wormhole from the future. Nanotechnology, which is fast acquiring the irritancy and, one assumes, will acquire the obsolescence factor that Virtual Reality helmets did in the nineties, also crops up *yawn*There's also, wouldn't you know it, a big army conspiracy behind the whole thing which is hunting your obligatory drug-addled, wise-guy journalist (played by Eric McCormack from ""Will And Grace"" - who looks so out of place that I kept wishing that Jack McFarland would turn up and comfort him at his 'mannary'), a character that is completely extraneous in terms of the story.There's also the worrying hint at the end that the producers may be contemplating a sequel.In every way bigger, louder and brasher than it's predecessor, this film is also vastly dumber and more irritating. One day, maybe producers will realize that in the case of source material which is this good, you don't need extraneous trappings; just good actors, a decent script and a director who knows where to point a camera.",1,Weakening The Strain...,1254009600,"09 27, 2009",2009,3226,"['second', 'attempt', 'bringing', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'novel', 'Andromeda', 'Strain', 'screen', 'interesting', 'conundrum', 'ponder', 'not', 'terms', 'film', 'very', 'bad', 'terms', 'differences', 'tone', 'predecessor.1971', 'original', 'big-screen', 'outing', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'was', 'weirdly', 'compulsive', 'tale', 'group', 'predominantly', 'white', 'predominately', 'middle-aged', 'elderly', 'research', 'virologists', 'doing', 'battle', 'mysterious', 'extra-terrestrial', 'virus', 'inadvertently', 'unleashed', 'small', 'Californian', 'town', 'downed', 'Satellite', 'Set', 'predominantly', 'sealed', 'underground', 'research', 'bunker', 'could', 'be', 'cauterized', 'Nuclear', 'blast', 'should', 'threat', 'contamination', 'become', 'too', 'great', 'film', 'boast', 'cast', 'virtual', 'unknowns', 'weirdly', 'atonal', 'electronic', 'score', 'Gil', 'Mell', 'eacute', 'uncomfortably', 'claustrophobic', 'tense', 'atmosphere', 'splendid', 'use', 'abstract', 'shot-framing', 'split-screen', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'action', 'big', 'explosions', 'histrionics', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Crichton', 'book', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'one', 'best', 'one', 'most', 'splendidly', 'ominous', 'worryingly', 'authentic', 'first-contact', 'novels', 'ever', 'written', 'made', 'TV', 'remake', 'was', 'apparently', 'co-produced', 'Tony', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'given', 'tone', 'timbre', 'might', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'produced', 'Michael', 'Bay.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'compliment.From', 'outset', 'audience', 'beaten', 'head', 'CGI', 'bombast', 'research', 'virologists', 'are', 'now', 'forty', 'impossibly', 'good-looking', 'fit', 'racial', 'mix', 'hardly', 'seen', 'Benetton', 'commercials', 'Humvees', 'seem', 'cram', 'frame', 'two', 'minutes', 'gunfire', 'explosions', 'break', 'out', 'sporadic', 'abandon', 'are', 'treated', 'more', 'impassioned', 'histrionics', 'one', 'would', 'generally', 'expect', 'see', 'episode', 'Bold', 'Beautiful', 'seriously', 'kept', 'waiting', 'Ridge', 'stagger', 'bunker', 'be', 'perpetually', 'lit', 'chill-out', 'room', 'nightclub', 'demand', 'see', 'Stephanie', 'Taylor.Oh', 'yeah', 'then', 'virus', 'longer', 'just', 'extra-terrestrial', 'virus', 'now', 'also', 'sentient', 'telepathic', 'come', 'wormhole', 'future', 'Nanotechnology', 'fast', 'acquiring', 'irritancy', 'one', 'assumes', 'will', 'acquire', 'obsolescence', 'factor', 'Virtual', 'Reality', 'helmets', 'did', 'nineties', 'also', 'up', '*yawn*There', 'also', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'big', 'army', 'conspiracy', 'whole', 'thing', 'hunting', 'obligatory', 'drug-addled', 'wise-guy', 'journalist', 'played', 'Eric', 'McCormack', 'Will', 'Grace', 'who', 'so', 'place', 'kept', 'wishing', 'Jack', 'McFarland', 'would', 'turn', 'up', 'comfort', ""'mannary"", 'character', 'completely', 'extraneous', 'terms', 'story.There', 'also', 'worrying', 'hint', 'end', 'producers', 'may', 'be', 'contemplating', 'sequel.In', 'way', 'bigger', 'louder', 'brasher', 'predecessor', 'film', 'also', 'vastly', 'dumber', 'more', 'irritating', 'One', 'day', 'maybe', 'producers', 'will', 'realize', 'case', 'source', 'material', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'extraneous', 'trappings', 'just', 'good', 'actors', 'decent', 'script', 'director', 'who', 'where', 'point', 'camera']",The Andromeda Strain Miniseries
1157038,APRNYF8W2PTGQ,B0017IVHHO,"David C. Hill ""*** Dave""","[39, 44]","If you're looking for a taut, tense story about the outbreak of an alien plague and the desperate efforts of a band of scientists to isolate and defeat it ... then I suggest reading the original The Andromeda Strain novel, by Michael Crichton. Or, if you're video-centric, check out the 1971 movie adaptation. In either case, skip this A&E; two-night miniseries.I'll start with the caveat that I am quite fond of both the book and the 1971 movie (one of the first movies I remember going to -- we were not a big movie-going family). I was looking forward to this miniseries to refresh and expand on Crichton's story, updating it for a new generation. Instead, the core novel has been turned into soap opera mush, and the added time available (180 minutes, minus commercials) is wasted on a parallel conspiracy theory story that not only adds nothing, but never really gets resolved.This is a ""hard"" SF novel, focused on the science involved in diagnosing and dealing with Andromeda.  Secondarily, it's about the pressure upon the four scientists (expanded to five in the miniseries, and all but the main one renamed), faced with multiple ticking clocks and a pathogenic horror that could, if unchecked, kill the world as efficiently as it's killed the town of Piedmont (Arizona in the book, New Mexico in the 1971 movie, Utah in 2008).The miniseries turns the science into random and unfocused gobbledigook, including a talking computer that, evidently, does pretty much all the work for the research team. That leaves everyone time to chit-chat, mull over romances past and present, and hint at past events that are never explained (or that really aren't all that germane to the story). Meanwhile ...The original novel and movie did include a bit of ""conspiracy"" about them. While Wildfire was originally set up by Congress at Dr Stone's recommendation, it was to decontaminate space probes and astronauts and deal with any infections they might bring back. The government looked upon it, and Project Scoop, as a way to gather and develop potential bioweapons; this comes out over the course of the original tale, but is really a sidelight to it, an addition to the caution that we Need To Be Careful Out There.That's the part, though, that gets all the padding in the new miniseries. We get multiple government factions -- the DoD bioweapons head, his army gunsel, Homeland Security, a hapless president, a general whose motivations are mysterious -- and, of course, a doughty (and drug-addicted) journalist who's trying to track down this story and stay one step ahead of both the virus and the assassins sent to do him in.(Yawn.)It's layering cheap icing on the cake. It never really adds much -- except to distract from both the core story (which is bad) and the melodrama back at Wildfire (which, I guess, is good). You could excise the entire mess from the miniseries, and it wouldn't make a bit of difference to its resolution, but it would ratchet up the tension at Wildfire, rather than deflating it every time we cut to another scene.There's so much more to criticize -- scientists too young (and pretty) for the long and distinguished careers they're supposed to have; the world's most incompetent governmental conspiracy; the laugh-out-loud climactic race against the Wildfire auto-destruct; the baby and old man who vanish after the first half; a telepathic, self-aware, highly-adaptive uber-virus that came from the future through a wormhole; egregious firing-squad breaches of security at a highly classified installation ... the list goes on.When I saw ads in the movie theater for the miniseries, my thought was, ""Wow, it looks like The Andromeda Strain, only with car crashes."" I was at least partly correct: there were car crashes. But despite being able to be summed up with the same short paragraph in TV guide, I don't see much of the book, or original movie in here -- and that's a shame. In short, where this miniseries parallels the original, it does so in a muddled, mediocre fashion. Where it doesn't, it's even weaker. It adds nothing new to the original's vision, and the new stuff it does add feels more like it's one of those awful SciFi original movies than something from A&E;.",2,"What they adapted was poorly done, what they invented was worse",1213228800,"06 12, 2008",2008,4211,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'taut', 'tense', 'story', 'outbreak', 'alien', 'plague', 'desperate', 'efforts', 'band', 'scientists', 'isolate', 'defeat', 'then', 'suggest', 'reading', 'original', 'Andromeda', 'Strain', 'novel', 'Michael', 'Crichton', ""'re"", 'video-centric', 'check', '1971', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'case', 'skip', 'A', 'E', 'two-night', 'miniseries.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'caveat', 'am', 'quite', 'fond', 'book', '1971', 'movie', 'one', 'first', 'movies', 'remember', 'going', 'were', 'not', 'big', 'movie-going', 'family', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'miniseries', 'refresh', 'expand', 'Crichton', 'story', 'updating', 'new', 'generation', 'Instead', 'core', 'novel', 'been', 'turned', 'soap', 'opera', 'mush', 'added', 'time', 'available', '180', 'minutes', 'commercials', 'wasted', 'parallel', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'nothing', 'never', 'really', 'resolved.This', 'hard', 'SF', 'novel', 'focused', 'science', 'involved', 'diagnosing', 'dealing', 'Andromeda', 'Secondarily', 'pressure', 'four', 'scientists', 'expanded', 'five', 'miniseries', 'main', 'one', 'renamed', 'faced', 'multiple', 'ticking', 'clocks', 'pathogenic', 'horror', 'could', 'unchecked', 'kill', 'world', 'as', 'efficiently', 'killed', 'town', 'Piedmont', 'Arizona', 'book', 'New', 'Mexico', '1971', 'movie', 'Utah', '2008', '.The', 'miniseries', 'science', 'random', 'unfocused', 'gobbledigook', 'including', 'talking', 'computer', 'evidently', 'pretty', 'much', 'work', 'research', 'team', 'everyone', 'time', 'chit-chat', 'mull', 'romances', 'past', 'present', 'hint', 'past', 'events', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'germane', 'story', 'Meanwhile', 'original', 'novel', 'movie', 'did', 'include', 'bit', 'conspiracy', 'Wildfire', 'was', 'originally', 'set', 'up', 'Congress', 'Dr', 'Stone', 'recommendation', 'was', 'decontaminate', 'space', 'probes', 'astronauts', 'deal', 'infections', 'might', 'bring', 'back', 'government', 'looked', 'Project', 'Scoop', 'way', 'gather', 'develop', 'potential', 'bioweapons', 'out', 'course', 'original', 'tale', 'really', 'sidelight', 'addition', 'caution', 'Need', 'Be', 'Careful', 'Out', 'There.That', 'part', 'though', 'padding', 'new', 'miniseries', 'get', 'multiple', 'government', 'factions', 'DoD', 'bioweapons', 'head', 'army', 'gunsel', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'hapless', 'president', 'general', 'motivations', 'are', 'mysterious', 'course', 'doughty', 'drug-addicted', 'journalist', 'who', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'story', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'virus', 'assassins', 'sent', 'do', 'in.', 'Yawn', 'layering', 'cheap', 'icing', 'cake', 'never', 'really', 'much', 'distract', 'core', 'story', 'bad', 'melodrama', 'back', 'Wildfire', 'guess', 'good', 'could', 'excise', 'entire', 'mess', 'miniseries', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'bit', 'difference', 'resolution', 'would', 'ratchet', 'up', 'tension', 'Wildfire', 'rather', 'deflating', 'time', 'cut', 'scene.There', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'criticize', 'scientists', 'too', 'young', 'pretty', 'long', 'distinguished', 'careers', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'have', 'world', 'most', 'incompetent', 'governmental', 'conspiracy', 'laugh-out-loud', 'climactic', 'race', 'Wildfire', 'auto-destruct', 'baby', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'vanish', 'first', 'half', 'telepathic', 'self-aware', 'highly-adaptive', 'uber-virus', 'came', 'future', 'wormhole', 'egregious', 'firing-squad', 'breaches', 'security', 'highly', 'classified', 'installation', 'list', 'saw', 'ads', 'movie', 'theater', 'miniseries', 'thought', 'was', 'Wow', 'Andromeda', 'Strain', 'only', 'car', 'crashes', 'was', 'least', 'partly', 'correct', 'were', 'car', 'crashes', 'being', 'able', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'same', 'short', 'paragraph', 'TV', 'guide', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'book', 'original', 'movie', 'here', 'shame', 'short', 'where', 'original', 'so', 'muddled', 'mediocre', 'fashion', 'Where', ""n't"", 'even', 'weaker', 'nothing', 'new', 'original', 'vision', 'new', 'stuff', 'add', 'feels', 'more', 'one', 'awful', 'SciFi', 'original', 'movies', 'something', 'A', 'E']",The Andromeda Strain Miniseries

1157040,A1GBVCADZBO8YG,B0017IVHHO,Emc2,"[0, 3]","This miniseries is based on Michael Crichton's 1969 novelThe Andromeda Strain, and despite following the main general plot, this version has several interesting twists of its own that reflect today's state of technology (nanotechnology, GPS, cellular phones, etc.), the latest scientific knowledge (buckyballs, wormholes, time travel, etc.), a more politically correct selection of the race and gender of the main characters, and adds up our XXI century environmental concerns that were at its infancy 40 years ago when the original novel was written. The miniseries also deepens into the ""conspiracy"" by the government to conceal the Scoop Project with the obligatory journalist running behind to uncover the army wrong doings.A comparison with the 1971The Andromeda Strainfilm is difficult. The main strength of the original film is that it followed faithfully the novel's original plot, but this adherence to detail make the movie's pace too slow; often leaving the impression that  you are watching a documentary. In contrast, the pace in the 2008 version is faster, and it takes full advantage of the additional time (almost an hour longer) to go into interesting details and new subplots, always exploiting today's more advance technologies, and thus, making the movie look more like an upgrade rather than a simple update. However, I particularly dislike the time wasted with the boring army conspiracy. And as for the environmental message, it feels a bit forced into the plot, probably should have been introduced more smoothly early in the story, but in the end, this new plot fully reflects Chricton's everlasting concerns with modern society inability to deal adequately with the environment and the unintended consequences of new technologies.Not a great remake, but neurotic characters and conspiracies apart, it is quite an upgrade of the original story and it managed to keep the Crichton feel and touch.

1157044,AHB0L35LOICAN,B0017IVHHO,"GB Banks (publisher, author) "", author""","[26, 35]","Although my memory of them are vague, I have fond memories of both the original Michael Crichtonnoveland the 1971filmadaptation. So when I learned about the remake of the story, a four-hour miniseries, no less, I was very excited to see what would be done with this new incarnation of the Crichton thriller. Unfortunately the answer is ""not much.""Probably the prototype for the classic ""plague-sweeping-the-world"" thriller, The Andromeda Strain in its original form is an exciting roller coaster ride of a thrillfest that kept you on the edge of your seat. The Andromeda Strain Miniseries, while not the worst film I've ever seen, or close to it, was a big disappointment compared to the expectations I had. Much of the plot and some of the characters were far too contrived, more like extraneous elements thrown in for effect than being integral parts of the tale. Although I enjoy a good government conspiracy story like the next guy or gal, the one woven into this piddling plot left me expecting to see the bad guys don black hats, grow long, thin mustaches, and cackle evilly as they grin into the camera for effect. Eric McCormack's character, the obligatory ""whistle-blower, drug addict"" that the government goes to the utmost ridiculous efforts to eliminate seemed so unnecessary that I began wanting to kill him myself.Another flaw of this film is that it's practically got the words ""deux ex machina"" branded visibly onto every twist and turn, and some of those twists were as confounding as a dog trying to catch his own tail. If anyone sees this movie and thinks it even remotely reflects the writing skills of the original author, Michael Crichton, they will be grossly mistaken. In fact I feel that the author should the makers of this film for defamation of character, libel, character assassination, and any other trumped up charge humanly possible. In fact, the more I write about this movie, the more I realize just how much I dislike it.In reality, the movie's no worse than a high budget ""B"" movie, somewhat like those that have become the staple of the Sci Fi Channel. The problem is that this film had much more promise, expectation, and a far higher foundation to build upon than most of those films, and somehow wound up being worse than those films. Those films knowingly don't take themselves seriously, but this film I feel wasn't taken nearly seriously enough. I hope the actors in this movie got paid well, because they certainly won't be getting any big time starring roles based on their work here.

In this case the interesting element is the method used to take over, and clean up the planet of the human race that is kind of in the way. They use the curiosity of this human race and infiltrate a satellite that is devised to capture living and unknown extraterrestrial organisms or substances. It does crop one substance hat is living but with no DNA. That substance will cause the satellite to crash back on the earth, without being in any way damaged, which is quite hard to believe today. This satellite will be recuperated by some people in a close-by city, opened and the substance will spread and kill everyone except an alcoholic who uses methylated spirit to satisfy his thirst and a new-born baby. The objective is to cause an overreaction among the human collective body called society and for them humans to try to destroy this invading substance with a nuclear missile. And that's the trick. This substance is fed by nuclear radiations or feeds on nuclear radiations. This fact is discovered by the scientists who are trying to understand the phenomenon, the counter order is given to the pilot delivering the missile and she turns back, but it is too late: the substance had already invaded the plane and it took control of it and the missile will eventually reach its target and humanity will be destroyed entirely. All that because of the human vain belief that one single invention, destructive substance or mechanism can be supreme and destroy everything, which is false, and we know it, since cockroaches for one are not at all disturbed in their very busy life by nuclear radiations. What is surprising is that this film, done for TV, should be so poor on the characters as if television did not have the means to hire good authors, directors and actors any more.

Wow.  Fantastic and powerful.  Then they do what the contemporary film industry does -- remake a great film by watering down the action and suspense, tossing in a lot of smarmy politics, stressing an ecological message, and presenting a politically-correct cast.  Add some ridiculous and sketchy sci-fi details making it obvious that those writing the script weren't all that knowledgeable about science fiction or true science.  Wormholes?  Time travel?  Coincidences?  The movie is so busy focusing on current political and social issues that the real story gets lost.  Add to that, the personal lives of the cast are explored, when that isn't at all important to the story.  It should just focus on the virus and the effort to understand, thus cure, it.  More, political correctness actually was tossed aside as it looked like several helpless animals were killed in some of the scenes.  Disgusting.  To make the film even worse, they threw in a crusading journalist played by that guy from Will & Grace, who was pretty much arrogant and conceited throughout, as if he was doing us all a favor by being there -- even though his story line was nonsensical and extraneous, could have been edited out entirely.  Was it worse or better that the main character, played by Benjamin Bratt, even ended up romancing a fellow scientist on the team?  A lot of triviality just really destroyed the concept of this story, and I honestly fell asleep the first time I watched it, missing the last hour.  Because A&E reran the film several times, I was able to catch what I'd missed, but alas, it was just as bad as the other three hours.

It gets more preposterous the longer it runs.When ""The Andromeda Strain"" sticks to Crichton, it's riveting and believable, with an ending that made sense, because Crichton did his homework.

For example, a lab technician running the tests would have been more realistic to me than a computer that can run any imaginable test immediately by voice command.The subplots were waaaaaay out of control. By having so many side stories, the main story was diluted and couldn't build a sense of urgency.The preachy environmentalist message changed what might have been an enjoyable sci-fi drama into yet another in a long line of 'save the Earth' movies. Don't get me wrong. I like the Earth. I really do. It's one of my favorite planets. I just don't need to be clubbed over the head with yet another environmentalist lecture. I think the movie as a whole would have been much better off without it.If those were all the failings, I probably would have given this 3 or 4 stars. I could have suspended disbelief and enjoyed the show. But...The wormhole/time travel element was so incredibly bad that it killed the movie for me. The story would have been so much better if they had just left the origin of Andromeda as an unknown. Simply say 'It came from somewhere in space.' and be done with it. But, if you're determined to use time travel as a story element, at least don't cause a paradox.Minor Things that Irritated Me:It appears that to be an effective doctor or scientist, one must be young and attractive. I suppose that anyone who is old, fat or just plain ugly could not possibly be of any help finding a cure to an infectious disease.The 'cure' confused me. The progress of Andromeda was shown by the water and vegitation turning brown as Andromeda killed it. When the benevolent virus was released and consumed Andromeda, everything turned green again... did all the plants suddenly come back to life? Will the animals? Will the people?I have a little problem with the idea that the sterno drinker who takes a bottle of aspirin a day and vomits huge amounts of blood was casually invited over to the fire station for a poker game. In my experience, the destitute and chronically ill are either a) hospitalized or b) shunned. I don't know, maybe it's a Utah thing.In Conclusion:This movie had a lot of things going for it.

The film was in serious need of an upgrade, and while the new technology really enhanced the film, making it all the more believable, the updates to the story along with the new characters that were introduced, really did the original story a disservice. The basic story was not changed, just modernized, and for that we are very thankful. The story was always a terrific tale of Science Fiction and an early message about the damage we are doing to our planet. I like how the story was updated and I loved the technological advancements. What I didn't like was how much they changed the cast. They wanted to make them more diverse and I don't have a problem with that, but this is not a story that focuses on individuals, it's more about the virus, the technology, and the human impact on our planet. In that sense, I felt it hurt the series, but the technology enhanced it, evening things out. The original novel and movie were 4 stars, and so is the remake.

1157074,A1ASGRO3X620BD,B0017IVHHO,T. Smith,"[12, 18]","I was cautiously looking forward to the A&E; Andromeda Strain series.  I loved the book and the Wise movie, but the SFX needed updating, and making it a miniseries would let more of the story be told.What a fool I was.It's grotesquely bad.  Aside from the moonbat content slathered on with a trowel, the original was a SCIENTIFIC thriller.  That's what made it unusual and extraordinary..and a multimillion-selling book that remains in print after nearly four decades.  So the Hollywood bozos, not understanding the concept, sort of hand-wave the science with a bunch of incorrectly-used buzzwords, and then drag out the PC/liberal playbook for making a generic Hollywood action flick.  Men stupid and bad (liberal men are...tolerable).  Woman wise and good.  Military stupid and evil.  Media wise and noble.  Bush lied!  Save the planet! Etcetera ad nauseum. (Seriously, the amount of PC/enviro/liberal/moonbat crap akwardly jammed into the film is amazing.)  The dialog sounds like a bowl of lumpy oatmeal.  One of the reasons the original book and movie were so scary is that they tried to convince you it was all real and plausible.  So in this lame version, when the chief scientist starts making open-line cell phone calls to the highly irritating reporter/meth-head from a ""sooper-dooper top secret locked-down hush-hush underground military bio-science lab,"" all you can do is laugh.  The final straw in part one is the scientists standing in a meeting room and watching a live feed (!!) from the HUD of an F-16 firing a ""nuclear-tipped missile""...which then ""accidently"" goes off.Then I watched the last part, and it's worse, much worse.  First, I'll admit to skipping through chunks on 4x speed, but I'll bet I didn't miss anything worth seeing.  Basically, Andromeda is supposedly a warning sent from the future to stop us from ""raping the planet."" The film then disintegrates into hysterically awful SF gibberish about wormholes and most of the ending violates every law of physics and common sense I can think of. Example: the water coolant pool over the core of the nuclear reactor at the bottom of Wildfire is OPEN TO THE AIR (water reactors have to be sealed because they operate at about 70 atmospheres of pressure and 785 degrees F).  There's even worse, trust me.  I could go on and on and on....All in all, it was the worst SF movie I've ever seen that wasn't made in the 50s (or direct to video), and Michael Crichton has every right to track down the screenwriter and club him to a pulp with a copy of the bloated script.Not only am I annoyed they've ruined this hoped-for update, I'm even more annoyed that because they've pi55ed in the pool and now there probably won't be a good remake of the original for another decade or more.  May they sprout a fulminating carbuncle in their nads.",1,Unbelivably horrible...poor Crichton!,1212019200,"05 29, 2008",2008,2810,"['was', 'cautiously', 'looking', 'forward', 'A', 'E', 'Andromeda', 'Strain', 'series', 'loved', 'book', 'Wise', 'movie', 'SFX', 'needed', 'updating', 'making', 'miniseries', 'would', 'let', 'more', 'story', 'be', 'fool', 'was.It', 'grotesquely', 'bad', 'Aside', 'moonbat', 'content', 'slathered', 'trowel', 'original', 'was', 'SCIENTIFIC', 'thriller', 'what', 'made', 'unusual', 'extraordinary..and', 'multimillion-selling', 'book', 'print', 'nearly', 'four', 'decades', 'Hollywood', 'bozos', 'not', 'understanding', 'concept', 'sort', 'hand-wave', 'science', 'bunch', 'incorrectly-used', 'buzzwords', 'then', 'drag', 'out', 'PC/liberal', 'playbook', 'making', 'generic', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'flick', 'Men', 'stupid', 'bad', 'liberal', 'men', 'are', 'tolerable', 'Woman', 'wise', 'good', 'Military', 'stupid', 'evil', 'Media', 'wise', 'noble', 'Bush', 'lied', 'Save', 'planet', 'Etcetera', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'Seriously', 'amount', 'PC/enviro/liberal/moonbat', 'crap', 'akwardly', 'jammed', 'film', 'amazing', 'dialog', 'bowl', 'lumpy', 'oatmeal', 'One', 'reasons', 'original', 'book', 'movie', 'were', 'so', 'scary', 'tried', 'convince', 'was', 'real', 'plausible', 'So', 'lame', 'version', 'when', 'chief', 'scientist', 'making', 'open-line', 'cell', 'phone', 'highly', 'irritating', 'reporter/meth-head', 'sooper-dooper', 'top', 'secret', 'locked-down', 'hush-hush', 'underground', 'military', 'bio-science', 'lab', 'can', 'do', 'laugh', 'final', 'straw', 'part', 'one', 'scientists', 'standing', 'meeting', 'room', 'watching', 'live', 'feed', 'HUD', 'F-16', 'firing', 'nuclear-tipped', 'missile', 'then', 'accidently', 'off.Then', 'watched', 'last', 'part', 'worse', 'much', 'worse', 'First', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'skipping', 'chunks', '4x', 'speed', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'anything', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Basically', 'Andromeda', 'supposedly', 'warning', 'sent', 'future', 'stop', 'raping', 'planet', 'film', 'then', 'hysterically', 'awful', 'SF', 'gibberish', 'wormholes', 'most', 'ending', 'violates', 'law', 'physics', 'common', 'sense', 'can', 'think', 'Example', 'water', 'coolant', 'pool', 'core', 'nuclear', 'reactor', 'bottom', 'Wildfire', 'OPEN', 'TO', 'THE', 'AIR', 'water', 'reactors', 'have', 'be', 'sealed', 'operate', 'about', '70', 'atmospheres', 'pressure', '785', 'degrees', 'F', 'even', 'worse', 'could', 'go', '.All', 'was', 'worst', 'SF', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', '50s', 'direct', 'video', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'right', 'track', 'down', 'screenwriter', 'club', 'pulp', 'copy', 'bloated', 'script.Not', 'only', 'am', 'annoyed', ""'ve"", 'ruined', 'hoped-for', 'update', ""'m"", 'even', 'more', 'annoyed', ""'ve"", 'pi55ed', 'pool', 'now', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'remake', 'original', 'decade', 'more', 'May', 'sprout', 'fulminating', 'carbuncle', 'nads']",The Andromeda Strain Miniseries

1157078,AQFGSOIZXWRS7,B0017IVHHO,Your Role Model,"[5, 5]","Man, you hate to say it, but watching this modern Andromeda Strain remake is a bit like watching Wayne Newton in concert-- not much raw talent, but he's trying so gosh darn HARD to entertain you. If enthusiasm was ability, this remake would be 5 stars. Unfortunately, it's not, and it's not.Instead of being the taught, direct, minimalist thriller the original was, this one takes a 'kitchen sink' approach. We've got space wormholes (yes, you read that right), terrorism and 9/11 references, inter-military intrigue, a crack investigative reporter with a drug problem (of course), gratuitous assassinations, radical environmentalism, common-sense environmentalism, divorce, parenting issues, nationalistic tensions within the scientific team, romantic tensions within the scientific team, rampant politics, and *gasp* the President's wife in peril!!!It's kind of like going camping with absolutely everything you own... seemed like a good idea on paper, but seldomly works out that way in practice. Especially when everything is as Hollywooded-up as it is here.Sadly, the one thing this Andromeda Strain does NOT have is a legitimate sense of tension. The focus is just too diluted, too many things are going on, many of them not too consequential. As a result, even with the long running time, many of the goings on have to communicated purely verbally, in tossed-off one-liners, said with little or no emotion backing them. The characters don't seem to much care, so neither do we.There's also a big fat strain of the ridiculous and random in some of the sideplots... such as when an eagle uber-conveniently drops an Andromeda-diseased mouse at the feet of some National Guard troops. Or how about the ridiculousness of the whole 'space wormhole from the future' explanation for Andromeda? Sometimes it's better when things go UN-explained, especially when you want the audience to suspend disbelief, but I guess that particular note never made it to the powers-that-be on this one.It also doesn't help that the cast seems mostly just as Hollywooded-up as the proceedings. Sure, a few of the actors in the cast, notably Ricky Schroeder, McCormack, Andre Braugher, and the unknown-but-quite-good Viola Davis, attempt to inject some sense of humanity (or at least style, in Braugher's case) and urgency into their characters and the goings-on, but they're largely defeated by the stilted and occasionally just plain weird dialogue. For example, just LISTEN to Benjamin Bratt's estranged wife speak early on... you will say over and over again to yourself, ""No one talks like this... NO ONE...""Oh, and speaking of Ben Bratt as the focal character, he's fairly inert, in the way that many hunky heroes tend to be inert in any kind of complex drama. The fact that he's ethnic doesn't really make it any more interesting.Also, a big shudder goes out to the normally cute and interesting Christa Miller (of 'Drew Carey' and 'Scrubs' fame). In this miniseries, she appears to be either savagely over-botoxed, or the victim of an unfortunate plastic surgery accident... her face looks distractingly odd, a bit frozen and sandblasted... something's just off. A shame, as she's got real talent, and was quite the beauty on Drew Carey. Perhaps aging gracefully isn't such a bad thing after all?But, this remake has far bigger problems than that, obviously. It's just an exercise in ""throw everything against the wall and see what sticks"" filmmaking, and it strings you along for a very long time on its noise and energy, until you finally figure out that it really ISN'T going to get any better, and that all of the (few) good moments are the ones where it most closely hewed to the original.So, in other words, there was no point to this remake, unless one thinks unchecked melodrama is an improvement.I'm not anti-remake in general... 'Battlestar Galactica', for example, is an example of a fine remake that surpasses the original. And I suppose in the environment of our current fears of terrorism and biological weapons, it was only a matter of time before someone took a crack at re-doing the original, grand-daddy-of-'em-all bioterror story. But, god, couldn't they have done a better job? The filmmakers here out-clever themselves out of giving us a taught, gripping story, and the slick 'Hollywooded up' production values/look actually make the events less authentic and scary, not more.But they DON'T get that, as you'll see when you watch the DVD extras... a great deal of self-congratulation on how much better the special effects are these days, how it's great that they doubled the length and added so much junk to the proceedings, etc. etc.  Like I said, the Wayne Newton effect. This story deserved better.Scariest of all? The ending sets us up for a sequel or even a series.
