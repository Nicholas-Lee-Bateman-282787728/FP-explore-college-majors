692919,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B0000633SL,Brian E. Erland,"[0, 0]","Not always, but sometimes old adages ring true. In this particular case it's the one ""things get better with age"". Juice Newton has been high on my list of favorite female vocalist for years and this well produced live concert performed in an intimate setting only reconfirms her position as a premier singer and performer. Her genuine concern for her audience and love for what she is doing is right there for everyone to see and her disarming smile and almost childlike glee is infectious. And of course let's not forget about that incredible voice of hers. Once again she proves that absolutely nobody belts out a ballad like Juice Newton. NOBODY!Juice delivers a nice mix of audience favorites; Angel of the Morning, Queen of Hearts, The Sweetest Thing, Break It To Me Gently and my personal favorite Shot Full of Love, along with a number of new and lesser known tunes. All the songs work well together and keep both the live audience and the home viewer fully engaged from beginning to end. `Juice Newton - Every Road Leads Back to You' is sheer entertainment that will delight both the longtime fan and those unfamiliar with her body of work. This is a DVD that I'll watch over and over again.

692920,A20ITI6SAIKPK4,B0000633SL,Hoosier Hayseed,"[0, 0]","I got this DVD because I have long been a fan of Juice Newton - even though I've never understood, or ever heard it explained, where her name came from.Be that as it may, she is a one of a kind, incredible talent.  I've long since loved her songs, and I did see her in person once, and she sounded just as incredible in person as she does on her records.She's on a par with Martina McBride, and that in itself is saying something, because I think Martina is head and shoulders above just about all the other girl country singers.But Juice Newton definitely seems to march to the beat of her own drummer - and she just has talent oozing out of her pores.It's amazing - lots of people are good singers, but very few just seem to have that extra something that absolutely compells you to watch them, and where you almost get goose bumps when they sing.  But she's one of them.In fact, I got pretty excited when I first saw this DVD available - as far as I know, it's the only one she's ever made.But if you're a Juice Newton fan, please rest assured that you will be transported to another level of bliss, just listening to her and her band - and she doesn't short-change you, either.  This one is loaded with lots of very good stuff.This is a concert, at a pleasant pace, with banter and asides, and just great music.",5,What A Knockout Talent,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,1315,"['got', 'DVD', 'have', 'long', 'been', 'fan', 'Juice', 'Newton', 'even', ""'ve"", 'never', 'understood', 'ever', 'heard', 'explained', 'where', 'name', 'came', 'from.Be', 'may', 'one', 'kind', 'incredible', 'talent', ""'ve"", 'long', 'loved', 'songs', 'did', 'see', 'person', 'once', 'sounded', 'just', 'incredible', 'person', 'records.She', 'par', 'Martina', 'McBride', 'saying', 'something', 'think', 'Martina', 'head', 'shoulders', 'above', 'just', 'other', 'girl', 'country', 'singers.But', 'Juice', 'Newton', 'definitely', 'march', 'beat', 'own', 'drummer', 'just', 'talent', 'oozing', 'pores.It', 'amazing', 'lots', 'people', 'are', 'good', 'singers', 'very', 'few', 'just', 'seem', 'have', 'extra', 'something', 'absolutely', 'watch', 'where', 'almost', 'get', 'goose', 'bumps', 'when', 'sing', 'one', 'them.In', 'fact', 'got', 'pretty', 'excited', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'DVD', 'available', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'only', 'one', 'ever', 'made.But', ""'re"", 'Juice', 'Newton', 'fan', 'please', 'rest', 'assured', 'will', 'be', 'transported', 'level', 'bliss', 'just', 'listening', 'band', ""n't"", 'short-change', 'either', 'one', 'loaded', 'lots', 'very', 'good', 'stuff.This', 'concert', 'pleasant', 'pace', 'banter', 'asides', 'just', 'great', 'music']",Juice Newton - Every Road Leads Back to You
692921,A284YU1EFY79TB,B0000633SL,"Invisiboy2001 ""invisiboy2001""","[3, 3]","This DVD features a terrific 77-minute live show in which Juice Newton mixes several of her '80s hits with many new songs, making for a thoroughly up-to-date and enjoyable experience. Newton's records have never captured her vocal range, but this DVD showcases her considerable vocal talents quite well! Many of her most popular hits are included, such as ""The Sweetest Thing,"" ""Queen Of Hearts,"" ""Hurt,"" and ""Love's Been a Little Bit Hard On Me""...and Newton throws in an equal measure of newer material, making this DVD more about who she is as an artist than about who she was. The song choices range from folk to country to pop to big band to a terrific vocal quartet finale, all of which Newton handles with admirable panache...talk about a musically diverse performer!! The DVD also features a great interview with Newton and several important people in her life...it is great to finally get a glipmse of this private celebrity's personality. And this is one lady who knows her priorities, knows her business, and has her feet firmly planted on the ground. Another excellent feature is four new audio tracks, all of which are TERRIFIC. From the tender, moving ballad ""Love Is Still Alive And Well"" to the astonishingly delicate and powerful ""If I Could, I Would,"" Newton showcases that while her days of being at the top of the charts may be behind her, she is producing her best music ever.  Hopefully this amazing DVD will find a large audience. Newton's true talents have been a well kept secret for far too long.",5,A terrific concert DVD...with lots of extras!,1017792000,"04 3, 2002",2002,1522,"['DVD', 'terrific', '77-minute', 'live', 'show', 'Juice', 'Newton', 'mixes', 'several', ""'80s"", 'hits', 'many', 'new', 'songs', 'making', 'thoroughly', 'up-to-date', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'Newton', 'records', 'have', 'never', 'captured', 'vocal', 'range', 'DVD', 'considerable', 'vocal', 'talents', 'quite', 'well', 'Many', 'most', 'popular', 'hits', 'are', 'included', 'such', 'Sweetest', 'Thing', 'Queen', 'Hearts', 'Hurt', 'Love', 'Been', 'Little', 'Bit', 'Hard', 'Me', 'Newton', 'equal', 'measure', 'newer', 'material', 'making', 'DVD', 'more', 'who', 'artist', 'who', 'was', 'song', 'choices', 'range', 'folk', 'country', 'pop', 'big', 'band', 'terrific', 'vocal', 'quartet', 'finale', 'Newton', 'admirable', 'panache', 'talk', 'musically', 'diverse', 'performer', 'DVD', 'also', 'great', 'interview', 'Newton', 'several', 'important', 'people', 'life', 'great', 'finally', 'get', 'glipmse', 'private', 'celebrity', 'personality', 'one', 'lady', 'who', 'priorities', 'business', 'feet', 'firmly', 'planted', 'ground', 'excellent', 'feature', 'four', 'new', 'audio', 'tracks', 'are', 'TERRIFIC', 'tender', 'moving', 'ballad', 'Love', 'Is', 'Still', 'Alive', 'Well', 'astonishingly', 'delicate', 'powerful', 'Could', 'Would', 'Newton', 'days', 'being', 'top', 'charts', 'may', 'be', 'producing', 'best', 'music', 'ever', 'Hopefully', 'amazing', 'DVD', 'will', 'find', 'large', 'audience', 'Newton', 'true', 'talents', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'kept', 'secret', 'far', 'too', 'long']",Juice Newton - Every Road Leads Back to You
692922,A1I7IFB39E6AKL,B0000633SL,"J. Hayes ""Just SayJoe""","[15, 16]","I had the pleasure of being at this fantastic show in LA on 9/10.  What an amazing showcase for the talents of Juice Newton.  Watching the DVD was almost as good as being there (and I know).  As a longtime Juice fan I had never seen her live and was impressed by how beautiful she sounds live.  As her partner Otha Young says in the behind the scenes feature, Juice sounds even better live.  Her song selection is perfect, great new songs, and beautiful renditions of older hits.  I especially was touched by her rendition of ""Old Flame"".  What the dvd doesn't show is how Juice spent so much time and energy on her fans after the show signing autographs and talking. What  makes watching this concert bittersweet is how the next morning after such a great night of song our world changed forever with the attacks of 9/11.My only quibble with the dvd (and cd) are the lame graphics.  The cover is bland and could have been much more exciting looking.  The picture on the cover isn't even from the show.  Oh well, it's the show that counts the most and THAT is excellent.
