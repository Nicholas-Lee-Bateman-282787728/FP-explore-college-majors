These books and their screen adaptions are not cozies. The present horrifying crimes and criminals unflinchingly.Meet Tony Hill. Tony is a psychologist, a professor at a fictional university in a fictional city that might be Manchester or Leeds or even York (although the accents are comprehensible unlike those in sayRed Riding Trilogy [Blu-ray]). Hill is drawn to police work, but while embracing the title of forensic psychologist he rejects the label ""profiler."" Hill is a bachelor, clumsy but straight, and seems to have a mild  of Aspergers. His talent is both intellectual and emotional. He draws elaborate schematics which show obscure connections of events and people. His emotional connection with the victim, killer and crime scene provide important understandings which lead to the solving of crime.Hill is played by Robson Green, whose disheveled brilliance is eerily reminiscent of Columbo or even Bill Gates. Hermione Norris plays DCI Carol Jordan, his police mentor, in this first season, who sticks with Tony even when he is seemingly leading the investigation in the wrong direction.The title apparently comes from a T.S.

817928,A106016KSI0YQ,B0001Z4OT2,Jay Dickson,"[5, 8]","The best thing about this first season of the famous serial killer mysteries from the BBC is Robson Green as its protagonist, the brilliant but somewhat off-kilter Dr. Tony Hill, an expert in the psyches of murderers. Green's Hill has no annoying mannerly tics, despite the character's marked social awkwardness: you never seem to catch Green acting. But he slips right into the character of Tony Hill like a second skin, and sometimes is so believable as this man who can be so mild-mannered and affable in most situations but becomes extremely excited when working on a case with his partner, DCI Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris). Although Norris's part is much less interesting than Green's, the two get an agreeable rhythm going together, and you believe both in their mild flirtation and in their more important friendship, and most of all in their successful partnership in catching the surprising number of serial killers running amok in the fictional Northern city of ""Bradfield"" (which Newcastle upon Tyne doubles for in these productions). The first two two-part mysteries in this series are based on actual novels by the creator of Hill and Jordan, Val MacDermid; surprisingly, these are much weaker than the third story which is original to the show's screenwriters. The first of the three, ""The Mermaids Singing"" (all of the titles are taken from lines from T.S. Eliot's poetry), isn't very good at all as far as its plot goes: MacDermid seemed bent on outdoing Thomas Harris for how baroque her serial killer's M. O. is, which is less frightening than just silly (it involves duplicating medieval torture devices at what must be a ridiculous expense). You're better off here focusing on the interactions between Robson and Norris and at how they establish their characters. But by the third installment in the series, not only have they got their characters down pat, but the plot gets much better: this mystery, about a killer hunting down a series of jurors who acquitted a man accused of murdering a child, is genuinely suspenseful. Atmosphere in a series like this is everything, and the production team does fine work capturing the peculiar medieval echoes of the Northern English hills and fields; there's also a very effectively unnerving synthesizer score of mostly odd industrial sounds. The Hill series does get much better as it goes; the second year's dramas are much better plotted than the first year's.",3,Northern aggression,1263340800,"01 13, 2010",2010,2429,"['best', 'thing', 'first', 'season', 'famous', 'serial', 'killer', 'mysteries', 'BBC', 'Robson', 'Green', 'protagonist', 'brilliant', 'somewhat', 'off-kilter', 'Dr.', 'Tony', 'Hill', 'expert', 'psyches', 'murderers', 'Green', 'Hill', 'annoying', 'mannerly', 'tics', 'character', 'marked', 'social', 'awkwardness', 'never', 'seem', 'catch', 'Green', 'acting', 'right', 'character', 'Tony', 'Hill', 'second', 'skin', 'sometimes', 'so', 'believable', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'mild-mannered', 'affable', 'most', 'situations', 'extremely', 'excited', 'when', 'working', 'case', 'partner', 'DCI', 'Carol', 'Jordan', 'Hermione', 'Norris', 'Norris', 'part', 'much', 'less', 'interesting', 'Green', 'two', 'get', 'agreeable', 'rhythm', 'going', 'together', 'believe', 'mild', 'flirtation', 'more', 'important', 'friendship', 'most', 'successful', 'partnership', 'catching', 'surprising', 'number', 'serial', 'killers', 'running', 'amok', 'fictional', 'Northern', 'city', 'Bradfield', 'Newcastle', 'Tyne', 'doubles', 'productions', 'first', 'two', 'two-part', 'mysteries', 'series', 'are', 'based', 'actual', 'novels', 'creator', 'Hill', 'Jordan', 'Val', 'MacDermid', 'surprisingly', 'are', 'much', 'weaker', 'third', 'story', 'original', 'show', 'screenwriters', 'first', 'three', 'Mermaids', 'Singing', 'titles', 'are', 'taken', 'lines', 'T.S', 'Eliot', 'poetry', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'as', 'far', 'plot', 'MacDermid', 'seemed', 'bent', 'outdoing', 'Thomas', 'Harris', 'how', 'baroque', 'serial', 'killer', 'M.', 'O.', 'less', 'frightening', 'just', 'silly', 'duplicating', 'medieval', 'torture', 'devices', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'ridiculous', 'expense', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'here', 'focusing', 'interactions', 'Robson', 'Norris', 'how', 'establish', 'characters', 'third', 'installment', 'series', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'got', 'characters', 'down', 'pat', 'plot', 'much', 'better', 'mystery', 'killer', 'hunting', 'down', 'series', 'jurors', 'who', 'acquitted', 'man', 'accused', 'murdering', 'child', 'genuinely', 'suspenseful', 'Atmosphere', 'series', 'everything', 'production', 'team', 'fine', 'work', 'capturing', 'peculiar', 'medieval', 'echoes', 'Northern', 'English', 'hills', 'fields', 'also', 'very', 'effectively', 'unnerving', 'synthesizer', 'score', 'mostly', 'odd', 'industrial', 'sounds', 'Hill', 'series', 'get', 'much', 'better', 'second', 'year', 'dramas', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'plotted', 'first', 'year']",Wire in the Blood - The Complete First Season The Mermaids Singing / Shadows Rising / Justice Painted Blind

It's a crime drama/police procedural, focusing largely on the capture of serial killers (a theme some of us may find overused), and it is gritty, sometimes gory.  And many Americans, me among them, must wish it had subtitles: between the local accent, and the softness with which the characters speak, it's very difficult to make out what's going on.The series is nicely filmed, on location, and uses enough extras to make that location believable as a bustling city.  It boasts a good cast. Robson Green, to be sure, stars as Dr. Tony Hill, psychologist-academic-profiler, giving a substantial performance as an intense, intelligent, troubled, fallible, and flexible man.  He is ably supported by Hermione Norris as Detective Chief Inspector Carol Jordan; Emma Hardy as DC Paula McIntyre, and Mark Letheren as DS Kevin Geoffries.However, ""Wire"" now advertises itself as ""based upon the characters created by"" McDermid, a relatively new author, who hasn't written nearly enough to keep a series going. Most episodes of the series are written by others. If you've never read her work, McDermid is a daring writer, who frequently breaks new ground; her best work is troubling, intensely gory and violent.  She is considered one of he leading lights of the British mystery school known as tartan noir: more bloody and violent than usual, lightened, occasionally, thank goodness by that bloody-minded Scots humor.  Written, self-evidently, by a Scot, which Mc Dermid is.Episode 1 of the first series, ""I Hear the Mermaids Singing,"" is based upon the McDermid book of the same name,The Mermaids Singing (Dr. Tony Hill and Carol Jordan Mysteries); an extremely bloody one, about a sadistic serial killer operating in the city's gay community.  It's been cleaned up considerably for TV.  Episode 2, ""Shadows Rising,"" is, in fact, based upon McDermid'sThe Wire in the Blood (Dr. Tony Hill and Carol Jordan Mysteries).  It too, is an extremely gory book, about attractive young girls disappearing all over the country, later to be found murdered.  And it, too, has been cleaned up considerably for TV. The third episode presented, ""Justice Painted Blind,"" which is not based upon a McDermid work, is not only not up to McDermid's standard, it just doesn't deal with her usual material. Instead, it chooses to concern itself with the doings of someone seriously dissatisfied with the country's justice system.""Wire in the Blood"" is a quote from a poem by T.S. Eliot; its meaning isn't entirely clear, even to McDermid, but we might as well call it an irresistible urge to kill.  Unfortunately, what with one thing and another, many Americans will have frustrating difficulties trying to follow this material. Therefore, I can't recommend it to anyone not, at least, familiar with McDermid's work.",3,Best for McDermid Fans,1214438400,"06 26, 2008",2008,3415,"['Robson', 'Green', 'Wire', 'Blood', 'British', 'television', 'detective', 'series', 'actually', 'made', 'Green', 'own', 'production', 'company', 'big', 'television', 'star', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'Independent', 'Television', 'ITV', 'series', 'based', 'work', 'prize-winning', 'British', 'author', 'Val', 'McDermid', 'set', 'fictional', 'Midlands', 'city', 'Bradfield', 'undoubtedly', 'based', 'Midlands', 'city', 'Manchester', 'where', 'worked', 'journalist', '16', 'years', 'still', 'resides', 'Furthermore', 'filmed', 'Manchester', 'English', 'Midlands', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'here', 'Green', 'native', 'Newcastle', 'not', 'far', 'away', 'crime', 'drama/police', 'procedural', 'focusing', 'largely', 'capture', 'serial', 'killers', 'theme', 'may', 'find', 'overused', 'gritty', 'sometimes', 'gory', 'many', 'Americans', 'must', 'wish', 'had', 'subtitles', 'local', 'accent', 'softness', 'characters', 'speak', 'very', 'difficult', 'make', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'on.The', 'series', 'nicely', 'filmed', 'location', 'enough', 'extras', 'make', 'location', 'believable', 'bustling', 'city', 'good', 'cast', 'Robson', 'Green', 'be', 'sure', 'Dr.', 'Tony', 'Hill', 'psychologist-academic-profiler', 'giving', 'substantial', 'performance', 'intense', 'intelligent', 'troubled', 'fallible', 'flexible', 'man', 'ably', 'supported', 'Hermione', 'Norris', 'Detective', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Carol', 'Jordan', 'Emma', 'Hardy', 'DC', 'Paula', 'McIntyre', 'Mark', 'Letheren', 'DS', 'Kevin', 'Geoffries.However', 'Wire', 'now', 'based', 'characters', 'created', 'McDermid', 'relatively', 'new', 'author', 'who', ""n't"", 'written', 'nearly', 'enough', 'keep', 'series', 'going', 'Most', 'episodes', 'series', 'are', 'written', 'others', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'work', 'McDermid', 'daring', 'writer', 'who', 'frequently', 'new', 'ground', 'best', 'work', 'troubling', 'intensely', 'gory', 'violent', 'considered', 'one', 'leading', 'lights', 'British', 'mystery', 'school', 'known', 'tartan', 'noir', 'more', 'bloody', 'violent', 'usual', 'lightened', 'occasionally', 'thank', 'goodness', 'bloody-minded', 'Scots', 'humor', 'Written', 'self-evidently', 'Scot', 'Mc', 'Dermid', 'is.Episode', '1', 'first', 'series', 'Hear', 'Mermaids', 'Singing', 'based', 'McDermid', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Mermaids', 'Singing', 'Dr.', 'Tony', 'Hill', 'Carol', 'Jordan', 'Mysteries', 'extremely', 'bloody', 'one', 'sadistic', 'serial', 'killer', 'operating', 'city', 'gay', 'community', 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'considerably', 'TV', 'Episode', '2', 'Shadows', 'Rising', 'fact', 'based', ""McDermid'sThe"", 'Wire', 'Blood', 'Dr.', 'Tony', 'Hill', 'Carol', 'Jordan', 'Mysteries', 'too', 'extremely', 'gory', 'book', 'about', 'attractive', 'young', 'girls', 'disappearing', 'country', 'later', 'be', 'found', 'murdered', 'too', 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'considerably', 'TV', 'third', 'episode', 'presented', 'Justice', 'Painted', 'Blind', 'not', 'based', 'McDermid', 'work', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'McDermid', 'standard', 'just', ""n't"", 'deal', 'usual', 'material', 'Instead', 'concern', 'doings', 'someone', 'seriously', 'dissatisfied', 'country', 'justice', 'system', 'Wire', 'Blood', 'quote', 'poem', 'T.S', 'Eliot', 'meaning', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'clear', 'even', 'McDermid', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'call', 'irresistible', 'urge', 'kill', 'Unfortunately', 'what', 'one', 'thing', 'many', 'Americans', 'will', 'have', 'frustrating', 'difficulties', 'trying', 'follow', 'material', 'Therefore', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'not', 'least', 'familiar', 'McDermid', 'work']",Wire in the Blood - The Complete First Season The Mermaids Singing / Shadows Rising / Justice Painted Blind

817941,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,B0001Z4OT2,"Tiggah ""the Anglophile""","[84, 86]","Based on the novels by Val McDermid, Wire in the Blood is a gritty, rivetting, suspenseful psychological crime drama; it is also, without a doubt, one of the best series of that genre around.  Robson Green (Touching Evil, Reckless, Me & Mrs. Jones, The Student Prince, The Gambling Man, Grafters, Soldier Soldier) stars as Dr. Tony Hill, a clinical psychologist who moonlights as a criminal profiler for the police.  Tony is brilliant in his ability to gain insights into the criminal mind, but his brilliance comes at a cost, compensated as it is by an equal degree of social ineptitude.  Like an absent-minded professor, Tony has a mind so focused that he easily becomes oblivious to his surroundings and to those around him.  It doesn't help matters that he talks to himself or that he finds it helpful to physically act out various aspects of the crime in question--things that are best NOT done in a public place!  Though the storylines are very serious--even chilling--the very nature of Tony's character provides the occasional welcome moment of lightness and humour.  Those familiar with Robson Green will know that this is the type of character at which he excels--characters which are, at the very least, just a little bit odd.Tony's connection with the police is via Detective Chief Inspector Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris--Cold Feet's Karen Marsden), a shrewd, hard-working cop, who is well aware of Tony's brilliant mind and of his value to the police.  There exists almost from the start--and always beneath the surface--a mutual attraction between Tony and Carol, and it is here that Tony most poignantly feels his lack of social skills.There are, at the time of writing, two sets on dvd (with set three due for release in February 2006).  Set one contains three episodes (each presented as two back-to-back 50 minute episodes); set two contains four 100-minute episodes.  DVD extras on set one are limited to brief text-based bios, but set two consists of interesting and informative interviews with Robson Green, Hermion Norris, author Val McDermid, and the production team.Though this is a series, each episode is movie length, and I would challenge anyone to find a Hollywood crime drama as good as any one of the episodes in this outstanding series.  If you enjoy top quality, impeccably-acted, gritty, dark, intelligent psychological crime drama which draws the viewer right in--shows like BBC's Waking the Dead, for example--you will definitely enjoy this series, and I recommend both sets without hesitation.  I enjoyed the series so much that I bought McDermid's latest Tony Hill novel, The Torment of Others (2004), which I also thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend.  Personally, I can't wait for the release of set three, and I hope Koch Vision continues to release future sets as they become available!Very highly recommended!",5,British Crime Drama at its Very Best!,1136592000,"01 7, 2006",2006,2856,"['Based', 'novels', 'Val', 'McDermid', 'Wire', 'Blood', 'gritty', 'rivetting', 'suspenseful', 'psychological', 'crime', 'drama', 'also', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'genre', 'around', 'Robson', 'Green', 'Touching', 'Evil', 'Reckless', 'Me', 'Mrs.', 'Jones', 'Student', 'Prince', 'Gambling', 'Man', 'Grafters', 'Soldier', 'Soldier', 'Dr.', 'Tony', 'Hill', 'clinical', 'psychologist', 'who', 'criminal', 'profiler', 'police', 'Tony', 'brilliant', 'ability', 'gain', 'insights', 'criminal', 'mind', 'brilliance', 'cost', 'compensated', 'equal', 'degree', 'social', 'ineptitude', 'absent-minded', 'professor', 'Tony', 'mind', 'so', 'focused', 'easily', 'oblivious', 'surroundings', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'helpful', 'physically', 'act', 'out', 'various', 'aspects', 'crime', 'question', 'things', 'are', 'best', 'NOT', 'done', 'public', 'place', 'storylines', 'are', 'very', 'serious', 'even', 'chilling', 'very', 'nature', 'Tony', 'character', 'occasional', 'welcome', 'moment', 'lightness', 'humour', 'familiar', 'Robson', 'Green', 'will', 'know', 'type', 'character', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'least', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'odd.Tony', 'connection', 'police', 'Detective', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Carol', 'Jordan', 'Hermione', 'Norris', 'Cold', 'Feet', 'Karen', 'Marsden', 'shrewd', 'hard-working', 'cop', 'who', 'well', 'aware', 'Tony', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'value', 'police', 'almost', 'start', 'always', 'beneath', 'surface', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'Tony', 'Carol', 'here', 'Tony', 'most', 'poignantly', 'lack', 'social', 'are', 'time', 'writing', 'two', 'sets', 'dvd', 'set', 'three', 'due', 'release', 'February', '2006', 'Set', 'one', 'three', 'episodes', 'presented', 'two', 'back-to-back', '50', 'minute', 'episodes', 'set', 'two', 'contains', 'four', '100-minute', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'extras', 'set', 'one', 'are', 'limited', 'brief', 'text-based', 'bios', 'set', 'two', 'consists', 'interesting', 'informative', 'interviews', 'Robson', 'Green', 'Hermion', 'Norris', 'author', 'Val', 'McDermid', 'production', 'series', 'episode', 'movie', 'length', 'would', 'challenge', 'anyone', 'find', 'Hollywood', 'crime', 'drama', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'episodes', 'outstanding', 'series', 'enjoy', 'top', 'quality', 'impeccably-acted', 'gritty', 'dark', 'intelligent', 'psychological', 'crime', 'drama', 'viewer', 'right', 'shows', 'BBC', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'example', 'will', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'series', 'recommend', 'sets', 'hesitation', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'bought', 'McDermid', 'latest', 'Tony', 'Hill', 'novel', 'Torment', 'Others', '2004', 'also', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'release', 'set', 'three', 'hope', 'Koch', 'Vision', 'release', 'future', 'sets', 'become', 'available', 'Very', 'highly', 'recommended']",Wire in the Blood - The Complete First Season The Mermaids Singing / Shadows Rising / Justice Painted Blind
817942,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0001Z4OT2,Z Hayes,"[3, 3]","I discovered this series quite by accident. Having watched and appreciatedMasterpiece Contemporary: Place of Execution, I was keen to read the novel (which inspired the TV adaptation) by Val McDermid. The novel was very well-written, and a nail-biting suspense thriller. Then I discovered that Val McDermid wrote other novels as well, and a couple of them inspired the TV crime drama Wire in the Blood.I finished watching all of Season 1 and have become a fan of this gritty crime drama that follows the investigations led by DI Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris). She is assisted by clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green), a rather eccentric figure who delves deeply into the minds of serial killers, studies patterns of criminal behavior and profiles criminals. His methods may seem strange at times, but he always manages to get results. Both Jordan and Hill make a strange if compelling pair, with Jordan analyzing a case based on evidence, and Hill working based on his knowledge of deviant behavior and what makes people commit disturbing crimes.Unlike some of the ""cozy"" mysteries such as the long-runningMidsomer Murders - Set OneandThe Complete Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Wire in the Blood is not for the faint of heart. The crimes are horrific, sometimes involving children, almost always patterned on deviant behavior and the suspects are almost always very disturbed individuals. The crime scenes are difficult to watch as are the way victims are found and even the forensic examinations are graphic and unsettling. Though compelling, this is not really a show to watch in one sitting, and may very well give viewers nightmares.The first season contains three main stories, each divided into two episodes:The Mermaids Singing - Hill is on the trail of a seriously disturbed serial killer who targets homosexuals.Shadows Rising - The skeletal remains of a young woman is found, and when further evidence turns up, DI Jordan and Hill realize they have a serial killer on their hands, one with a penchant for dark-haired young women.Justice Painted Blind - Another unsettling case, this time revolving around an old child abduction and murder case. A couple of apparently random murders turn out not to be so random after all when it is discovered that the victims do share a connection involving an old court case where the accused was found not guilty. This throws up a whole bunch of suspects, including the parents of the murdered girl.The writing on this crime drama is excellent, and Robson Green is credible as the clinical psychologist who has a rare knack for profiling and getting under the skin of some of the most dangerous criminals. The drama also explores the chemistry and tension between Hill and DI Jordan, all of which result in a riveting show that keeps viewers coming back for more.",5,"Intelligent, well-plotted, and disturbing crime drama",1318204800,"10 10, 2011",2011,2822,"['discovered', 'series', 'quite', 'accident', 'Having', 'watched', 'appreciatedMasterpiece', 'Contemporary', 'Place', 'Execution', 'was', 'keen', 'read', 'novel', 'inspired', 'TV', 'adaptation', 'Val', 'McDermid', 'novel', 'was', 'very', 'well-written', 'nail-biting', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'Then', 'discovered', 'Val', 'McDermid', 'wrote', 'other', 'novels', 'well', 'couple', 'inspired', 'TV', 'crime', 'drama', 'Wire', 'Blood.I', 'finished', 'watching', 'Season', '1', 'have', 'become', 'fan', 'gritty', 'crime', 'drama', 'investigations', 'led', 'DI', 'Carol', 'Jordan', 'Hermione', 'Norris', 'assisted', 'clinical', 'psychologist', 'Dr.', 'Tony', 'Hill', 'Robson', 'Green', 'rather', 'eccentric', 'figure', 'who', 'deeply', 'minds', 'serial', 'killers', 'studies', 'patterns', 'criminal', 'behavior', 'profiles', 'criminals', 'methods', 'may', 'seem', 'strange', 'times', 'always', 'get', 'results', 'Jordan', 'Hill', 'make', 'strange', 'compelling', 'pair', 'Jordan', 'analyzing', 'case', 'based', 'evidence', 'Hill', 'working', 'based', 'knowledge', 'deviant', 'behavior', 'what', 'people', 'commit', 'disturbing', 'crimes.Unlike', 'cozy', 'mysteries', 'such', 'long-runningMidsomer', 'Murders', 'Set', 'OneandThe', 'Complete', 'Inspector', 'Lynley', 'Mysteries', 'Wire', 'Blood', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'crimes', 'are', 'horrific', 'sometimes', 'involving', 'children', 'almost', 'always', 'patterned', 'deviant', 'behavior', 'suspects', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'very', 'disturbed', 'individuals', 'crime', 'scenes', 'are', 'difficult', 'watch', 'are', 'way', 'victims', 'are', 'found', 'even', 'forensic', 'examinations', 'are', 'graphic', 'unsettling', 'compelling', 'not', 'really', 'show', 'watch', 'one', 'sitting', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'give', 'viewers', 'nightmares.The', 'first', 'season', 'contains', 'three', 'main', 'stories', 'divided', 'two', 'episodes', 'Mermaids', 'Singing', 'Hill', 'trail', 'seriously', 'disturbed', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'Rising', 'skeletal', 'remains', 'young', 'woman', 'found', 'when', 'further', 'evidence', 'up', 'DI', 'Jordan', 'Hill', 'realize', 'have', 'serial', 'killer', 'hands', 'one', 'penchant', 'dark-haired', 'young', 'women.Justice', 'Painted', 'Blind', 'unsettling', 'case', 'time', 'revolving', 'old', 'child', 'abduction', 'murder', 'case', 'couple', 'apparently', 'random', 'murders', 'turn', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'random', 'when', 'discovered', 'victims', 'do', 'share', 'connection', 'involving', 'old', 'court', 'case', 'where', 'accused', 'was', 'found', 'not', 'guilty', 'up', 'whole', 'bunch', 'suspects', 'including', 'parents', 'murdered', 'girl.The', 'writing', 'crime', 'drama', 'excellent', 'Robson', 'Green', 'credible', 'clinical', 'psychologist', 'who', 'rare', 'knack', 'profiling', 'getting', 'skin', 'most', 'dangerous', 'criminals', 'drama', 'also', 'chemistry', 'tension', 'Hill', 'DI', 'Jordan', 'result', 'riveting', 'show', 'viewers', 'coming', 'back', 'more']",Wire in the Blood - The Complete First Season The Mermaids Singing / Shadows Rising / Justice Painted Blind
