BUT..........These people must be some of the dumbest people around, not to mention pathetic.  There are too many instances where the main characters do something completely stupid.---spoilers---Instances of stupid behavior:-  The caretaker knows about the demons yet hasn't done anything but bolt up the entrance to their dominion.-  The father is too busy with the house to care about his daughter's pleas.-  Kim promises the girl she won't leave her side or turn off the light, but then turns off the light and leaves after Sally falls asleep.- The demons say they are weak to light, yet the girl carries around a camera and small flashlight which doesn't help.- Kim promises Sally she will get her away from the house after the party, but she never does.- Sally places proof (photograph) of the demons on the table for her father to see but then hides it from other people and then the demons take it.  DUH- No one notices the library in shambles and wonders how a little girl could do that.- The doors keep locking in the house, knobs are broken off, no one ever questions anything.- The caretaker is brutally attacked, but it was ""just an accident"" , sure...sure.......- The characters in this movie fall down way too much and get knocked out.- Kim slowly and carefully descends the stairs and still falls when she hits a tripwire.- The father and daughter escape and just let the house alone and walk away.  They don't destroy the entrance to the demons' lair or the house itself.- The demons were tiny creatures who could have easily been overtaken by a human.and many more instances..........The end of the movie was slightly ambiguous, but we can assume that Kim became part of the demon ranks, as stated earlier in the movie how they need to add to their ranks each time they surface.

1503558,AAZRWLML88IZK,B005TK22CU,A kids review,"[1, 3]","After back-to-back supporting roles in Thank You for Smoking and Batman Begins back in 2005, Katie Holmes took a break from the movies -- call it maternity leave -- before returning to the big screen in 2008. Unfortunately, the film that marked her return was Mad Money, and since then, she's appeared in six straight bad films. To its credit, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is the best of those, and it's just shy of being good, but I just couldn't entirely get behind this remake of the 1973 TV movie of the same name. Starring opposite Holmes is Guy Pearce as Alex Hurst, who, along with his girlfriend Kim, is restoring an old mansion to prep it for the real estate market. When Alex's young daughter Sally is placed in his care and begins to hear voices calling to her from the basement, the mansions dark secrets gradually begin to unfold. I found the haunted house flick's effective atmosphere initially quite scary, but ultimately felt the film failed to deliver chills as successfully as the original.

Co-written and produced by del Toro; this remake of an old TV movie is for the most part a cliche attempt at a haunted house movie that would be more suitable at scaring children as opposed to adults. The only redeeming scares remain within the lighting, which builds a chilling atmosphere as creepy whispers are heard behind walls. Meanwhile, the creatures taunt poor little Sally running around with scalpels bigger than they are, yes, those little light fearing CGI creatures that resemble your Grandpa's ball sack, but less scary. Bailee Madison is excellent as sad-eyed Sally and gets the majority of screen time while Pearce and Holmes are stuck with thin characters and nowhere to go.

1503566,A187JA7XRK26NP,B005TK22CU,"Brandon Zarzyczny ""BigZ7337""","[1, 1]","Going into this movie, I for some reason thought that Del Toro had directed it, instead I saw in the opening credits that he had only produced the movie and co-wrote the script. So while you can clearly see Del Toro's influence on this film, it falls short of what it could have been. The intro of this film was scary, brutal, and freaking awesome, but it almost could have been from another movie (or maybe something shot to convince them to green light the film). After the intro the pace, violence, and scariness took an immense drop that never really picked up, even in the end. However, I loved the atmosphere and the creatures, along with their creepy actions. What I couldn't stand was the pure idiocy of all the people in the movie.DBAotD embraces Hollywood Horror tropes to a fault, they include having a shy child for some reason searching through a new scary house alone for no reason without any fear (even gathering tools and opening a rusted shut and bolted ash pit because she hears scary voices wanting to play), parents discounting their child without publishable scientific evidence of the events, and a refusal to leave the house until it's too late. I appreciated the fact that the movie didn't use the current Hollywood Horror cliche of the startle scare which I find very overused and annoying. I also liked how the people could actually fight and kill the monsters (tooth fairies/gnomes). However, I think that the director of the film really missed out on making a great movie by not embracing this facet further. I would have loved if the light (instead of just making the creatures run & hide) actually hurt/burned them. Then when the child starting using the camera flashbulb to fight them, it would have been awesome if the flash exploded the little creatures. They could have completely changed the annoying ending, and the whole tone of the movie for the better. Instead, we had the stupid people doing more stupid things, and the most overused ending in Horror, the potential sequel cliffhanger.

DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK is built on a rising terror, but Nixey also includes a few gratuitous moments of gore that the film could do without. They immediately shift the mood from creepy to shocking, which goes against the carefully-crafted suspense that he has developed. Several unnecessary shots use sweeping camera movements and conspicuous computerization to take us through long corridors and into the ventilation ducts where simple dissolves would have been much more effective.Minor complaints aside, DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK is an excellent entry into the Modern Gothic revival that may even top the 1973 original.

1503571,A1LV6LMUHV3DNS,B005TK22CU,"C. Bauer ""buccaneer""","[2, 3]","I am a fan of the horror genre.  Especially films dealing with the supernatural.  So I love the original versions of ""The Haunting"" and ""The Innocents"" both made before 1966.  I also love the George C. Scott film made in Seattle in the early 1980's titled ""The Changeling"".  So each time a new horror film comes out and the promos look inviting, I watch it.  Fortunately I watched this film over the last TWO nights on pay per view, that is the first hint,  and won't have to be concerned with unloading this film back on Amazon or to eBay.  Let me say at the outset that Guy Pearce's acting was the worst I've seen.  Not only did he look unwell, he lacked any attraction in the portrayal of his character which acting has made him so appealing in other films such as ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Ravenous"" and ""The Time Machine"".  The girl chosen to play his daughter was excellent as was ""Mrs. Tom Cruise"" Katie Holmes.  In fact they were terrific.  The only problem there was the actor chosen to play the small girl looks remarkably like Katie Holmes and in this film Holmes portrays the girlfriend of Guy Pearce who is the actual father of this child; the biological mother is out of the picture.  Perhaps a different choice of child actor would have been better. The similarities between Holmes and the child actor are that remarkable. I also expected alot more from this renowned and intelligent director.  But he did not deliver.  While getting great acting out of Holmes, the child actor and the supporting csst, he could not make Pearce anything but someone I would avoid doing business with and someone I certainly could not feel emotional about either as a daughter or a girlfriend.  At times he was like a brat straight out of an 80's flick.  I must say the setting was pure Gothic and Art Nouveau straight out of William Morris world.  Deliciously beautiful.  Cudos to those designers.  The ""creatures"" were as revolting and therefore as successful as you could have wished a movie ghoul to be.  Cudos to whoever thought them up.  But the story stumbled along implausibly after the first scene, set some 70 to 100 years earlier than the story in chief, which was downright scarey.  The party and dinner table scene late in the film, the innumerable times the child was left alone when noone would do such a thing given suspicions about her ""mental state"", and the scene where both adults are sidelined late in the story so the ""ghouls"" can get to the child are examples of storywriting that I think needed more work.  All the money that went into making this film! Think of how much more difficult it is to raise money for films now.  Given this and all the great actors and directors out there and all the designers and F/X artists who can ""blow your mind"" today's films should eclipse older films every single time.  All this film made me do at the end was delete it from my collection and long for something that would really, really, make me hesitant to shut off the lights at bedtime.  So I watched ""The Changeling"" again and shivered and jumped at every sound and bump in the night.  ""Don't Be....."" should have made me do that.  It promised it would.  It did not really deliver.  But the horror of ""The Changeling"" was enough to wipe out the memory of this unsatisfactory experience completely.  Too bad.  Such a waste.",2,Don't Be Afraid of WHAT????,1325808000,"01 6, 2012",2012,3335,"['am', 'fan', 'horror', 'genre', 'Especially', 'films', 'dealing', 'supernatural', 'So', 'love', 'original', 'versions', 'Haunting', 'Innocents', 'made', '1966', 'also', 'love', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'film', 'made', 'Seattle', 'early', '1980', 'titled', 'Changeling', 'time', 'new', 'horror', 'film', 'out', 'promos', 'look', 'inviting', 'watch', 'Fortunately', 'watched', 'film', 'last', 'TWO', 'nights', 'pay', 'view', 'first', 'hint', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'concerned', 'unloading', 'film', 'back', 'Amazon', 'eBay', 'Let', 'say', 'outset', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'acting', 'was', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'look', 'unwell', 'lacked', 'attraction', 'portrayal', 'character', 'acting', 'made', 'so', 'appealing', 'other', 'films', 'such', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'Ravenous', 'Time', 'Machine', 'girl', 'chosen', 'play', 'daughter', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', 'Mrs.', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'fact', 'were', 'terrific', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'actor', 'chosen', 'play', 'small', 'girl', 'remarkably', 'like', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'film', 'Holmes', 'girlfriend', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'who', 'actual', 'father', 'child', 'biological', 'mother', 'picture', 'Perhaps', 'different', 'choice', 'child', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'similarities', 'Holmes', 'child', 'actor', 'are', 'remarkable', 'also', 'expected', 'alot', 'more', 'renowned', 'intelligent', 'director', 'did', 'not', 'deliver', 'getting', 'great', 'acting', 'Holmes', 'child', 'actor', 'supporting', 'csst', 'could', 'not', 'make', 'Pearce', 'anything', 'someone', 'would', 'avoid', 'doing', 'business', 'someone', 'certainly', 'could', 'not', 'feel', 'emotional', 'about', 'daughter', 'girlfriend', 'times', 'was', 'brat', 'straight', '80', 'flick', 'must', 'say', 'setting', 'was', 'pure', 'Gothic', 'Art', 'Nouveau', 'straight', 'William', 'Morris', 'world', 'Deliciously', 'beautiful', 'Cudos', 'designers', 'creatures', 'were', 'revolting', 'therefore', 'as', 'successful', 'could', 'have', 'wished', 'movie', 'ghoul', 'be', 'Cudos', 'whoever', 'thought', 'up', 'story', 'stumbled', 'along', 'implausibly', 'first', 'scene', 'set', '70', '100', 'years', 'earlier', 'story', 'chief', 'was', 'downright', 'scarey', 'party', 'dinner', 'table', 'scene', 'late', 'film', 'innumerable', 'times', 'child', 'was', 'left', 'alone', 'when', 'noone', 'would', 'do', 'thing', 'given', 'suspicions', 'mental', 'state', 'scene', 'where', 'adults', 'are', 'sidelined', 'late', 'story', 'ghouls', 'can', 'get', 'child', 'are', 'examples', 'storywriting', 'think', 'needed', 'more', 'work', 'money', 'went', 'making', 'film', 'Think', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'raise', 'money', 'films', 'now', 'Given', 'great', 'actors', 'directors', 'there', 'designers', 'F/X', 'artists', 'who', 'can', 'blow', 'mind', 'today', 'films', 'should', 'eclipse', 'older', 'films', 'single', 'time', 'film', 'made', 'do', 'end', 'was', 'delete', 'collection', 'long', 'something', 'would', 'really', 'really', 'make', 'hesitant', 'shut', 'off', 'lights', 'bedtime', 'watched', 'Changeling', 'again', 'shivered', 'jumped', 'sound', 'bump', 'night', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'do', 'promised', 'would', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'deliver', 'horror', 'Changeling', 'was', 'enough', 'wipe', 'out', 'memory', 'unsatisfactory', 'experience', 'completely', 'Too', 'bad', 'waste']",N/A

If you want something that will entertain you, check this movie out.DBAOTD is a remake of an old 70s film but the writers took a few liberties with the original so those wanting a faithful remake might be a little disappointed. (I made it a point not to see the original until after the remake so I wouldn't have anything to judge against.)There is quite a bit to like about this movie, though. The movie is visually pretty, with a great big gorgeous house as a backdrop to all of the goings on of the film. Del Toro uses every nook and cranny to the best effect, especially the outer grounds and main hallway. The acting is also pretty well done, especially the performance by the young actress playing Sally. (And if they ever want to remake Poltergeist, she should be the first name on the list.) There are a few snarls in the general acting but overall this is better than many of the other horror films currently out in theaters.The movie wasn't flawless and for a Del Toro film it was actually a little disappointing. This is definitely something I was glad to have watched, but I felt a little aggravated with some parts of the film. We get some explanation to the supernatural creatures and the backstory of the home's original owner, but much of it is shuttled to the back in favor of an overly long game of cat and mouse between the critters and the character of Sally. There's also a few scenes that were supposed to be emotional but just felt a little flat. (As well as several parts where I just couldn't understand people's reactions, but that's just me.)Overall this is a decent flick. Not one of Del Toro's best movies but not a horrible ""avoid at all costs"" watch. It'll be worth checking out as long as you go in looking purely for entertainment and not for an award-winning performance.",3,Not a bad popcorn flick.,1315699200,"09 11, 2011",2011,1914,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'big', 'scare', ""'ll"", 'creep', 'out', 'long', 'while', 'then', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'film', 'want', 'something', 'will', 'entertain', 'check', 'movie', 'out.DBAOTD', 'remake', 'old', '70s', 'film', 'writers', 'took', 'few', 'liberties', 'original', 'wanting', 'faithful', 'remake', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'disappointed', 'made', 'point', 'not', 'see', 'original', 'remake', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'judge', 'quite', 'bit', 'like', 'movie', 'though', 'movie', 'visually', 'pretty', 'great', 'big', 'gorgeous', 'house', 'backdrop', 'goings', 'film', 'Del', 'Toro', 'nook', 'cranny', 'best', 'effect', 'especially', 'outer', 'grounds', 'main', 'hallway', 'acting', 'also', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'especially', 'performance', 'young', 'actress', 'playing', 'Sally', 'ever', 'want', 'remake', 'Poltergeist', 'should', 'be', 'first', 'name', 'list', 'are', 'few', 'snarls', 'general', 'acting', 'overall', 'better', 'many', 'other', 'horror', 'films', 'currently', 'theaters.The', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'flawless', 'Del', 'Toro', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'little', 'disappointing', 'definitely', 'something', 'was', 'glad', 'have', 'watched', 'felt', 'little', 'aggravated', 'parts', 'film', 'get', 'explanation', 'supernatural', 'creatures', 'backstory', 'home', 'original', 'owner', 'much', 'shuttled', 'back', 'favor', 'overly', 'long', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'critters', 'character', 'Sally', 'also', 'few', 'scenes', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'emotional', 'just', 'felt', 'little', 'flat', 'As', 'well', 'several', 'parts', 'where', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'people', 'reactions', 'just', 'decent', 'flick', 'Not', 'one', 'Del', 'Toro', 'best', 'movies', 'not', 'horrible', 'avoid', 'costs', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'be', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'as', 'long', 'go', 'looking', 'purely', 'entertainment', 'not', 'award-winning', 'performance']",N/A

In fact, it wouldn't surprise if there are elements about it that come from Spanish folktales.  I took a couple classes in Folklore in college and this screams folktale.  Del Toro seems to taking his ideas from these old folktales ( I thought the same thing when I watched Pan' Labyrinth) and rewriting them and then filming them.  If that is what he's doing, there's nothing wrong with it.  It's simply a retelling of story that's been told and retold over the generations.  The story changes with time and each retelling until it becomes something unique.  This movie works because it's different from what Hollywood is passing for horror/suspense.  The film is getting eith 5 stars or 1 star from Amazon reviewers and I don't think either is fair.  3.5 to 4 is more appropriate.

Her mother has shipped her off to live with her father Alex (Guy Pearce with a really tragic hairstyle; Memento, L.A. Confidential) and his live-in girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes; Batman Begins, Abandon).  But things are about to take a turn for the worst when she arrives at her new home and begins to hear voices coming from an old coal stove in the basement.  The voices are asking her to unscrew the stove's door and let them out so they can play together.  But Sally's new friends don't want to play Hide and Seek.  They want to play Cat and Mouse with Sally.When Sally calls her mom to ask her to let her come home, her cries are ignored.  When she tries to tell her dad that they are in trouble, Alex is only interested in finishing the mansion's remodeling.  The only person she can confide in is Kim and, after she does her homework in looking up the house's history, she learns that there may be more to Sally's stories than a typical overworked imagination.I recently watched the original tv movie that this bigger budgeted movie is based off of and I can definitely say that this is probably what the original producers wanted.  In the original, Sally was a mousy, middle aged housewife but here she's a child so automatically she has your sympathy.  And the creatures are much scarier looking than those puppets of old.  They're faster and meaner and downright nasty. Just wait until you see a man offering his maid's teeth in exchange for his son.  And Katie Holmes still proves that she's a quality actress and not just Tom Cruise's former Stepford Wife.  Definitely worth seeing; just be sure to keep a light on.

1503575,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005TK22CU,C. Sawin,"[2, 4]","Guillermo del Toro is a man in Hollywood that nearly everyone has something flattering to say about. He's a visionary, a creative genius, and a breath of fresh air when the majority of Hollywood films are so focused on turning redundancy into a cash cow. But the films del Toro produces are just as intriguing as the ones he writes and directs. The Orphanage is one of the more original horror films in recent years and Splice, despite whether you liked it or not, delivered one of the most amazing audience reactions I've ever experienced in the theater. So along comes Don't Be Afraid of the Dark and while it doesn't leave the impact The Orphanage or Splice did, it's still a film that is done incredibly well.The lighting and the atmosphere of the film is what will more than likely strike you first. You're taken one hundred years into the past at the beginning of the film (according to the summary of this book) and it feels authentic. Candle light is the only light source and Emerson Blackwood's house is on the best side of the word magnificent. The tone is dark and the atmosphere is thick with shadows. In the present, the house is being remodeled by Alex (Guy Pearce) and Kim (Katie Holmes). It's still a beautiful house. Judging by the house itself, it's kind of similar to The Haunting remake from 1999 except Owen Wilson isn't around to lose his head and Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is a much better film.We're then introduced to Sally (Bailee Madison), Alex's daughter who clearly doesn't want to be there. Most of the stupid things in the film can be credited to Sally. That and she's a spiteful brat for half of the film. After stumbling onto an undiscovered basement, Sally hears voices coming from a furnace that's clearly been bolted tight for a reason. After doing exactly what you expect her to, the source of those voices is unleashed in hopes of feasting on human bones to replenish its army. The creatures in the film are reminiscent of both the small demons in The Gate and the ragdolls in 9. I found it an odd coincidence that the creatures were hurt by bright lights and only came out at night much like the trolls in Trollhunter, which I had just seen the day before. However, the intent of these creatures is much darker than anything it reminds you of.The creatures are fantastically creepy, as well. Seeing this movie in surround sound is a must. Hearing these little buggers whisper all around you is half the fun of the film. It almost makes you feel like you're hearing things. When they're not driving you insane or hiding from the light, the creatures are off being incredibly violent and leave most of their actions on-screen. Their scene with Mr. Harris comes to mind and it's almost overwhelming. You can see where the scene is going to go, but it's still pretty brutal. The scene with Sally in the bathroom and the one where they're slowly approaching Kim as she slips into unconsciousness are surprisingly ghoulish, as well.Don't Be Afraid of the Dark has an amazing atmosphere. The set pieces are extravagant, the lighting is brilliant, and its creatures are ugly and menacing. The film fully embraces its own macabre nightmarishness, which is certainly the most charming thing about it. But it doesn't come together in a way that's completely satisfying. The actors seem to do the best with the material they're given, so the writing is more than likely to blame. Don't Be Afraid of the Dark falls into typical horror movie fluff as characters make stupid decisions, character development seems a bit rushed, and the screenplay is fairly dull for something with del Toro's name attached to it. Nevertheless, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark features some very vivid and wicked imagery that makes the entire journey worthwhile.",3,Brilliant visually with a somewhat worn storyline,1314144000,"08 24, 2011",2011,3767,"['Guillermo', 'del', 'Toro', 'man', 'Hollywood', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'something', 'flattering', 'say', 'about', 'visionary', 'creative', 'genius', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'when', 'majority', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'focused', 'turning', 'redundancy', 'cash', 'cow', 'films', 'del', 'Toro', 'produces', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'intriguing', 'ones', 'directs', 'Orphanage', 'one', 'more', 'original', 'horror', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'Splice', 'liked', 'not', 'delivered', 'one', 'most', 'amazing', 'audience', 'reactions', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'experienced', 'theater', 'So', 'along', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Afraid', 'Dark', ""n't"", 'leave', 'impact', 'Orphanage', 'Splice', 'did', 'still', 'film', 'done', 'incredibly', 'well.The', 'lighting', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'what', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'strike', 'first', ""'re"", 'taken', 'one', 'hundred', 'years', 'past', 'beginning', 'film', 'according', 'summary', 'book', 'authentic', 'Candle', 'light', 'only', 'light', 'source', 'Emerson', 'Blackwood', 'house', 'best', 'side', 'word', 'magnificent', 'tone', 'dark', 'atmosphere', 'thick', 'shadows', 'present', 'house', 'being', 'remodeled', 'Alex', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Kim', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'still', 'beautiful', 'house', 'Judging', 'house', 'kind', 'similar', 'Haunting', 'remake', '1999', 'Owen', 'Wilson', ""n't"", 'around', 'lose', 'head', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'much', 'better', 'film.We', ""'re"", 'then', 'introduced', 'Sally', 'Bailee', 'Madison', 'Alex', 'daughter', 'who', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'there', 'Most', 'stupid', 'things', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'credited', 'Sally', 'spiteful', 'brat', 'half', 'film', 'stumbling', 'undiscovered', 'basement', 'Sally', 'voices', 'coming', 'furnace', 'clearly', 'been', 'bolted', 'tight', 'reason', 'doing', 'exactly', 'what', 'expect', 'source', 'voices', 'unleashed', 'hopes', 'feasting', 'human', 'bones', 'replenish', 'army', 'creatures', 'film', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'small', 'demons', 'Gate', 'ragdolls', '9', 'found', 'odd', 'coincidence', 'creatures', 'were', 'hurt', 'bright', 'lights', 'only', 'came', 'out', 'night', 'much', 'trolls', 'Trollhunter', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'day', 'However', 'intent', 'creatures', 'much', 'darker', 'anything', 'of.The', 'creatures', 'are', 'fantastically', 'creepy', 'as', 'well', 'Seeing', 'movie', 'surround', 'sound', 'must', 'Hearing', 'little', 'buggers', 'fun', 'film', 'almost', 'feel', ""'re"", 'hearing', 'things', 'When', ""'re"", 'not', 'driving', 'insane', 'hiding', 'light', 'creatures', 'are', 'being', 'incredibly', 'violent', 'leave', 'most', 'actions', 'on-screen', 'scene', 'Mr.', 'Harris', 'mind', 'almost', 'overwhelming', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'scene', 'going', 'go', 'still', 'pretty', 'brutal', 'scene', 'Sally', 'bathroom', 'one', 'where', ""'re"", 'slowly', 'approaching', 'Kim', 'unconsciousness', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'ghoulish', 'well.Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'amazing', 'atmosphere', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'extravagant', 'lighting', 'brilliant', 'creatures', 'are', 'ugly', 'menacing', 'film', 'fully', 'own', 'macabre', 'nightmarishness', 'certainly', 'most', 'charming', 'thing', ""n't"", 'come', 'together', 'way', 'completely', 'satisfying', 'actors', 'seem', 'do', 'best', 'material', ""'re"", 'given', 'writing', 'more', 'likely', 'blame', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'typical', 'horror', 'movie', 'fluff', 'characters', 'make', 'stupid', 'decisions', 'character', 'development', 'bit', 'rushed', 'screenplay', 'fairly', 'dull', 'something', 'del', 'Toro', 'name', 'attached', 'Nevertheless', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'very', 'vivid', 'wicked', 'imagery', 'entire', 'journey', 'worthwhile']",N/A

Gremlins, Chucky, Puppet Master and any number of movies featuring pint-size bad guys are always laughably unimpressive.  It doesn't matter how much money you dump into special effects.  Six-inch high bad guys are not intimidating.The plot is full of obvious holes, and the decisions made by the characters are mind numbingly moronic.  The sets are nice, the effects are nice, but that's no reason to see a film.The actress playing the little girl was very competent, I hope she gets a role in a movie that isn't stupid someday, I think she will do quite well.But I recommend giving this one a miss.  As with the earlier attempts at this subgenre best left unattempted, the film just isn't scary, and it becomes just terrible once the creatures start talking.  Definitely not worth the money.

I was completely absorbed in the story, there were enough clues along the way for me to understand the ending.  I went into it hoping to see Katie Holmes die, but her character was sympathetic enough that by the end I wanted her to live and escape the house.  I loved the set house.

At first it seem like this is home-sweet-home, but then they learn that some reputedly sinister things have occurred here in the past. But the adults aren't worried (predictable). Later, the daughter Sally (Bailee Madison) tells her father that she heard ""creatures"" talking to her from the basement, and they wanted to come and play with her. Of course, the adults don't believe her (again, predictable) and the father actually calls a psychiatrist to see if the girl is crazy. But we know that she's not. Actually, the story is just beginning, as you will discover.This could easily have been an uninteresting and silly horror film. But it wasn't. It was actually an entertaining and effective story that kept me watching with anticipation. I believe this film was saved from mediocrity by the spot-on and very believable performance by the extraordinarily talented and beautiful young actress, Bailee Madison (as Sally). Sally is the center--or focal point--for the movie. The character of Sally was well-written and Madison plays it with great skill and genuine feeling and emotion. She easily outshines her adult counterparts. That's pretty amazing for a ten-year-old.While this movie could have been better, I still recommend it if for no other reason than to see Bailee Madison's outstanding performance.

So now, in addition to iTunes and the ever-hated Flixster, we had the Sony app. And as much as i hate Flixster, at least their customer support will give you an iTunes disc for those who aren't ready to jump into the cloud.

They insisted that i use their UV application even tho they still sell their movies on iTunes. The epitome of hypocrisy, imo.So, just as we get used to emailing Flixster for support with iTunes, Sony comes along and demands we use their super-special, ultra-amazing Ultra Violet viewer.

It is no secret that everything he's involved in is always a success. I've never seen Cronos or Mimic yet but i will soon. He first caught my attention when he directed and wrote PANS LABYRINTH which quickly became a horror/fantasy classic all over the world. I think he really knew what he wanted to do with this movie, so much that he actually choose to find someone else to direct the film, Mr Troy Nixey. I would say this is an excellent start for Mr Nixey. The work they did on this film is amazing.Here's the intro's plot from WIKI : In Blackwood Manor in Providence County, Rhode island, renowned wildlife painter Lord Blackwood summons his housekeeper into the basement where he kills her with a hammer and chisel. He removes her teeth and offers them to mysterious creatures down an ash pit within an old fireplace; however, the creatures demand the teeth of children. Blackwood begs for them to give back his kidnapped son, only to be dragged down the ash pit by the creatures. In the present day, 8-year old Sally Hurst arrives in Rhode Island to live with her father Alex (Guy pearce) and his girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes), both restoring Blackwood Manor to put it on the market for their new client. They're the ones who'll have to deal with those creepy little creatures and find a way to get rid of them.....The acting is perfect, the little sally (Bailee Madison) is really good in her role and so as Guy pearce in the father's role. This was also very good surprise to see katie holmes on the screen again, i still believe she is one of the best actress in the world today, her role here is simple but she definitely delivered an honest performance. The cinematography is OVER THE TOP!. The colors and the different visual aspects of the house make me feel like I'm there too. They did a wonderful job with the lights as well, especially the lights inside the house, some of those shots are just gorgeous.The little creatures are amazing, extremely believable and very well done, i think this is what Mr nixey is good at; animations, they're spooky and they're mean. Loved it. The DVD also have very nice extras on the making of and interviews with some of the casts and crew. There is no gore here, no drugs, no sex or nothing like that.

(I realize that many consider that a plus, but I do not.)  The story is that of a father and his daughter along with the father's girlfriend who take ownership of an old New England mansion.  The mansion, however, is invested an unusual type of vermin, but vermin that are not supernatural, as the daughter convincingly demonstrates by bludgeoning one to death, and crushing another between rolling bookcases.  That's problem: not one of the adults sees any of the creature's severed limbs, or the daughter's numerous polaroid photographs.  The father is too preoccupied to give any attention at all to his distraught daughter, and nobody  seems to notices anything unusual .  After a caretaker is attacked by the creatures, wouldn't it have been logical for him to say he was attacked by something and have someone call an exterminator?  No one  does, and ultimately the house left as it was in the beginning with vermin still inhabiting their subterranean lair.  The father who states that he has banked everything on renovating the house walks away from his equity and the house goes into foreclosure.  That simply does not make any sense.

1503589,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B005TK22CU,Einsatz,"[2, 3]","Considering the overabundance of negative reviews, I fully expected to hate this movie.  To hedge my bet I bought it used but in pristine condition, cheap.  (I had seen the original when it was first telecast on TV, but I must confess I don't remember it enough for it to have influenced my opinion of this remake.)All things considered, no one was more surprised than I was that I actually liked this film.  Now comes the uncomfortable part where I must justify my response to a film that had a lot of flaws and a horde of detractors.The easy answer is that no one can validate personal taste; it is what it is.  In my case, this film resonated on a very basic level: I was entertained.  I loved the crazy little rat-monkey things.  I am a sucker for monster movies and at the heart of it; this was a monster movie (albeit on the minuscule side of malevolence).  That gang of teeth-mongering thingies was fascinating to watch, I quite forgot everything else the moment they appeared and took over.  That part I really liked.  As for the rest of the film, there were definite problems.  The ""restoration project"" was more stuffy than spooky, as far as haunted houses go.  The adults were in limited supply and only kept around as plot points rather than interested parties.  They were spaced few and far between to help in the isolation of the little girl.  Neither Katie Holmes nor Guy Pearce made much of an impression (especially Pearce); I don't think they were intended to.  Also, the colony of rat-monkey things were given a lot to overcome considering they are first introduced as disembodied voices.  Rather than sinister, their chatter came off as comical.

I am not here for that especially since I have not seen the original in years. I do remember it of course but it would be unfair to compare since I could be forgetting things. So as for this one I will review it kinda like it is a stand alone, although we all know better.Blackwood Manor in Rhode Island is a house that would be perfect for any family looking to settle down. The only problem is that it has a dark past that may still be lurking around. That is the thing that the Hurst family is about learn about as they are the family moving in. Father and daughter Alex & Sally are moving in along with Alex&#8217;s girlfriend Kim with the purpose of fixing it up to put on the market. So while doing so they uncover the basement and something about the fireplace is out of whack. Of course that could have just been the voices Sally is hearing that make it seem that way. These voices keep calling to her and that fire place may be where they are coming from.I thought this was a pretty good flick from first time director Troy Nixey and writers Matthew Robbins and Guillermo Del Toro. The setting and mood of the film are perfect as not only the house but outside of it gives off that somewhat gothic feel. Atmosphere and feel are major for any flick and this one as that feeling. Of course we then have the performances from the cast that are just as good. Guy and Katie are good of course but I feel like and rightfully so that Bailee Madison is the best here. After all it is her character that the film is mainly based around.The creatures here which are fairies are cool looking little things and I like that these types of flicks are still made. These little creature features are some of my all time favorites. This is a good film and one that I would recommend people check out.

Add really bad acting, so much so, that of the three main characters the only person who dies is the one who displayed all the qualities to have lived. The usual kid leaves mom to go and live with the divorced dad, and his girlfriend but has issues with that scenario. The usual library search for the history of the mansion which wasn't developed further. Too many loose ends just left hanging out there such as the previous owner just disappears; groundskeeper says and does little even when in the hospital; why the police are not called; why the hole isn't filled with concrete; why all the photos and critter body parts aren't examined by someone; why dad and daughter just drive off in a relatively good mood.

1503595,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005TK22CU,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","A rule to live by: If a house is haunted, get out of the house. But people will persist in dismissing those ominous signposts, those telltale clues. In horror pictures, children tend to be more savvy than the grown-ups, tend to heed those twitches of primordial unease. But I guess little Sally, sullen and unbelievably unhappy, is the one exception. I think that Bailee Madison constructs a nifty and intriguing character in Sally. Madison isn't cutesy-ootsy in that obvious Hollywood kid actor way, and this makes her instantly refreshing. It's not her fault the screenplay has her reacting unbelievably to what unfolds in the spooky mansion.DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK is based on the original 1973 teleplay which starred Kim Darby, and it supposedly had a lasting impact on a young Guillermo del Toro. Del Toro co-produces and co-writes this 2011 reimagining, except that one wishes he'd directed it as well. Because while you have to credit this retelling for its moody cinematography and its creepy gothic vibe and its stab at psychological horror, you also condemn some of its choices, its lapses in logic.How would you feel if you were a little kid and one neglectful parent passes you to the other? Sally, relocating from the warmth of Los Angeles to the depressing climate of the east coast, scorns her father's welcome, ignores his girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes). Sally, desolate and isolated, retreats into her own little world. And the unsuspected inhabitants of her father's sprawling mansion figure into it.There are whispers of the horror lying dormant in the Blackwood manor (also called Fallen Mill), disquieting rumors surrounding the mad artist who had lived in it decades and decades ago. Today, Sally's father (Guy Pearce) intends to restore the Victorian manor with the notion of then selling it for huge profits. Guy Pearce has a thankless role, playing not only a neglectful father but also an oblivious observer who grows only more unlikable as the film progresses. I was seriously wishing unfortunate things to befall him.You can't blame Sally for wanting to make friends. But these particular friends? Some may admire her pluck in braving the dark areas of the house, but I question her decision to cosy up to the things with the sibilant voices and who dwell, trapped, in a furnace grate in that gloomy, sealed-up basement. These skulking things don't exactly come off like cute Smurfs. When something calls out my name in a sibilant hiss and then goes skittering under the floorboards, I am not charmed. I am alarmed like a mother, and check out my dust as I promptly skedaddle out of the house. When these creatures hiss out Sally's name over and over and promise to be her friend, she lets them out the grate.The film-makers try to have their cake and eat it too. The film opts for that creeping psychological horror in which the corners of your mind do all the heavy lifting, and that works to a certain extent and even appreciated. Again, the rich gothic atmosphere convincingly conveys the proper mood. Your imagination, manipulated by foreshadowing and score and cinematography, can't help but conjure up all sorts of nastiness scurrying about in Fallen Mill's endless nooks and crannies. The creatures, when finally unveiled, actually live up to expectation. They are grimy and toothy and nightmarish enough. Maybe the most frightening bit in the movie has little Sally in the dark and under her sheets, tentatively canvassing for demonic interlopers. It's one of the few cheap scares that works.But maybe it's just me. Mostly, I don't find these little goblins particularly daunting, even if they earn scare points for their preferred consumption of children's teeth. And these tooth fairies seem more peevish than truly malignant. They'll cut up a person's wardrobe ensemble and they effectively terrorize the little girl (because Sally does eventually come to her senses). But the body count hardly rises, the payoff is slim. The Rock's take on the tooth fairy is actually more disturbing.Sally and her father's girlfriend, Kim, become more likable, especially when they begin bonding with each other. Katie Holmes, for an actress whose part doesn't give her much to do, actually performs well; she's a sympathetic character from jump. It took me longer to empathize with young Sally (mostly because I couldn't believe the dumb moves she was pulling). But how do you not feel for a little girl being so traumatized? And, as usual, in a horror movie, no one ever listens to a child. I think we all saw that child psychologist coming from a mile away. Ultimately, DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK falls short of its ambitions, fails to deliver those dark shivers it promised. But, despite its flaws, it's worth watching for the mood evoked, for the elegant visual look of the film, for the melancholy ending, and for Bailee Madison's performance. 3 out of 5 stars for Del Toro's reworking.SPOILERS now as I nitpick off the top of my head:- Someday, new residents of a haunted house will listen to the sinister groundskeeper's (or maid's or governess') warnings- Even in horror/dark fairy tale stories, Polaroid cameras must eventually run out of flash bulbs- I, in fact, question the use of the Polariod camera. why not, say, a bigger and more durable flashlight?- How self-involved is the dad that he allows his small child to have the run of the place by herself?- After the attack during the dinner party, when her dad and the guests are gathered around a distraught Sally in the library den, you'd think that Sally, to show incontestible proof, would point out that one goblin she'd just crushed with the sliding book shelf. Instead she says, ""I took a picture."" And I guess no one bothered to glance at the photographs scattered about the room. That or Sally just takes crummy photos- When you're on the ground and hordes of demons mere inches tall are swarming on you, the most expedient way to get out of that is by getting up- Trussed up with the same length of rope, as Kim and Sally (in that order) are being inexorably dragged towards the furnace, Kim, instead of slicing the rope between her and Sally, should've maybe cut the rope between her and the furnace.",3,DON'T BE AFRAID OF (getting up and swinging your arms to regain circulation while you wait for scary sh_- to happen in) THE DARK,1315180800,"09 5, 2011",2011,6204,"['rule',

It's a scare-free horror that combines cliche, inconsistency and utter stupidity of the part of the characters to end up with something that's slow and predictable.Some of my favorite inexplicable parts include:- A gardener is brutally attacked with multiple stab wounds (including one in the eye!) and it's brushed off as an accident.- One person goes missing and there are no questions let alone an investigation. The local PD's asleep at the wheel.- There's a bathtub attack by monsters with razor blades who struggle for minutes to get through the shower curtain.- The creatures are afraid of light until Act 3 when that whole thing is completely forgotten.- The parents are absolutely tone deaf to the series of deadly events unfolding in their home. I know it's a great horror cliche but here it looks like Guy Pearce and Katie Holmes border on negligence. At one point, they completely ignore a series of Polaroids showing the little critters and the corpse of crushed one left in the library. Way to look after your daughter!- Even after all the unpleasantness, the family decides one on final foray into the house of fun, moving around the dark in solitude like they've never seen a horror film before.

It seems Guillermo del Toro comes up with something good no matter what kind of movie he does! I'm aware he's not the director, but even so, this is a real good frightfest that teases the mind for a good while before revealing the reason to be afraid.But there's not only eerie voices within the houses that keep the story itneresting, there's also the family having problems. Between the father and his young daughter. Between the daughter and her potential mother-in-law. Between said lady and the girl's father. But as the story goes along, you get to learn a little bit of forgotten folklore and how dark fairy tales used to be, even pre-Grimm. The atmosphere, along with the Gothic-style mansion, are absolutely beautiful in their eeriness, along with several supporting characters that add to the violent mayhem (not a whole lot of it, but what there is effective to the thrill of death). And a girl that everyone takes for granted because of how nobody believes a kid due to hyperactive imagination, yet it all comes back with a vengeance without anyone expecting what happens (let alone the audience). From a downright creepy (and a bit violent) beggining to a tragic ending (finally! a horror movie that keeps to horror movie roots- not a happy ending!) and scant bits of humor, nowhere enough to ruin the scary feel of what's going on.I can definitely say I would recommend this to anyone wanting a throwback to old-fashioned horror.",5,"Retro standards, effective creeps and scares",1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,1638,"['So', 'let', 'get', 'straight', 'actually', 'recent', 'horror', 'movie', 'rated', 'R', 'yet', 'almost', 'swearing', 'not', 'sex', 'drugs', 'yet', 'plenty', 'potential', 'scare', 'audience', 'Guillermo', 'del', 'Toro', 'up', 'something', 'good', 'matter', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', ""'m"", 'aware', 'not', 'director', 'even', 'so', 'real', 'good', 'frightfest', 'mind', 'good', 'while', 'revealing', 'reason', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'eerie', 'voices', 'houses', 'keep', 'story', 'itneresting', 'also', 'family', 'having', 'problems', 'father', 'young', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'potential', 'mother-in-law', 'Between', 'said', 'lady', 'girl', 'father', 'story', 'along', 'get', 'learn', 'little', 'bit', 'forgotten', 'folklore', 'how', 'dark', 'fairy', 'tales', 'used', 'be', 'even', 'pre-Grimm', 'atmosphere', 'Gothic-style', 'mansion', 'are', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'eeriness', 'several', 'supporting', 'characters', 'add', 'violent', 'mayhem', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'what', 'effective', 'thrill', 'death', 'girl', 'everyone', 'granted', 'how', 'nobody', 'kid', 'due', 'hyperactive', 'imagination', 'back', 'vengeance', 'anyone', 'expecting', 'what', 'let', 'alone', 'audience', 'downright', 'creepy', 'bit', 'violent', 'beggining', 'tragic', 'ending', 'finally', 'horror', 'movie', 'horror', 'movie', 'roots-', 'not', 'happy', 'ending', 'scant', 'bits', 'humor', 'nowhere', 'enough', 'ruin', 'scary', 'feel', 'what', 'going', 'on.I', 'can', 'definitely', 'say', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'throwback', 'old-fashioned', 'horror']",N/A

A father (a not-so-charismatic Guy Pearce) that doesn't listen to his daughter's worries. A soon-to-be-mother-in-law that has difficulties to befriend the child but that will eventually grow closer. That same child being wiser than adults. A scary-looking caretaker that knows more that anybody else. I mean, this film serves us clich&eacute;s after clich&eacute;s and it doesn't even have clever dialogues. There is even a librarian that suddenly appears in the story because the screenplay needed him to explain the whole thing for us. How useful! Furthermore, the cause of the horror (without reveling too much) is disappointing to say the least. You laugh about it more than you are scared by it. So what is the point? Is that the story that Guillermo Del Toro is so proud of? Him, a talented story teller, is satisfied of the result? I swear, the documentary at the end, where Del Toro and the director are both praising their product, is more frightening than the movie!Another point: Roger Ebert, the famous movie critic, was glad that the child was braver than usual. The other option (having the child always scared) would have been a ""cheap shot"". Maybe so. But then again, to be able to identify with a character is also what's fun about a film. Who, in their right mind, will identify with the courage of little Sally? This film must have been made by people who do not have any children. I have yet to see a child who would wander in the deep woods by himself or herself. I have yet to see a child who would go alone in a scary looking basement because he or she is hearing terrifying whispers.

Shimkus ""Movie Manji""","[1, 3]","`Don't Be Afraid of the Dark' is a good movie with some sour patches that do not ruin what is a grim, and beautifully shot film. It has Guillermo del Toro's name all over it and it is certainly made in the same vein. If you have an artistic sense, and have a love of fairy tales, then I highly recommend this spooky film.Troy Nixey, who has only done a short film called Latchkey's Lament, which you can watch on Youtube, does an impressive job almost mimicking Guillermo's strengths. Nixey excels at bringing beauty and that feeling of never being alone, always being watched atmosphere. There is much to admire in how this film looks. The darks are rich, not grainy like digitized film, and there is a luminescent gold touch to the lamp light throughout the movie that you only see in the best movies. Many times I was reminded of Guillermo while enjoying scenes of clock gears and statesman like furniture.The house that `Don't Be Afraid of the Dark' takes place in is something to behold if you appreciate grandeur. There are locked gates to places that may be dangerous and seeking to be found lie passages hidden from unwritten times. And one day a sad, displaced girl named Sally finds a fire vent that has been tightly sealed with long steel bolts. Even the appearance of the vent was frightening for me.Don't Be Afraid of the Dark has spooky sounds that fly around the theater. They come from so many different places. From behind a classic literature book high on a shelf, in a room bursting with books, you hear a whimpering voice, almost to be mistaken for the wind that rattles the window in its sill that you hear out of sight somewhere behind your left ear. And it is so terrifying to me that the sounds are voices! A soul sapping chorus of different sounding little voices that have learned a new name. Poor Sally. She listens to these wicked voices fleeting so that she cannot set her eyes on anything. And the room is almost strategically lighted, so as to leave long and abysmal trenches of shadows across every floor in the manor.The soundtrack is sometimes powerful, and other times woefully underused. There are moments between Sally and Kim that could have been tearful, but fine acting overall. There is one particular scene that I was overcome with despair that they did not make better. A scene played in a mysterious labyrinth, but this time a good one, where Kim opens up to Sally, exposing her heart. Sally's eyes swell with tears and they embrace like family members. But the scene did not resonate beyond what you see on the screen. It is bereft of effect. I did not bite my upper lip with tears running down my cheeks as when Ophelia asks for a lullaby from her one true friend Mercedes in `Pan's Labyrinth'. And it's moments like that, sculpted by the more talented and proven director Guillermo del Toro, that so obviously inspired the young Nixey to make films. But it is one thing to idolize and appreciate high art in film, and another to make your own. But Nixey sure does have a fine eye for lighting and creating mood in frame.There should be some mild warning that on the second half of this movie are very bright and piercing lights. Let's call them the only weapon you can use against creatures that bathe in the night. It is necessary, but I sometimes felt that Nixey took pleasure in making us experience the discomfort that those monstrous fairies must feel when exposed to light that is natural or unnatural.Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is a fantastic, and scary movie that will remind you of the deadly messages undercover in your favorite fairy tales. It is a good bit of writing done by the very artistic Guillermo del Toro, whose presence is felt in the entire film. The setting is sometimes magical, and the mansion is filled with secrets and danger alike. There is some untapped potential that screams for a finer touch, in my opinion, but you may not think so.

That probably isn't fair, to be honest. The movie is beautiful in its own way, and a lot of my favourite horror movies would not compare well visually with Pan's Labyrinth or Hellboy II.But del Toro didn't direct this, he co-wrote it based on an old made-for-TV movie. It doesn't have the magic of Pan's Labyrinth or either of the Hellboy movies, but it is an attractive film.My real problem with the movie was that the acting was terrible, and the dialogue and plot were unbelievable and stupid.

1503607,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B005TK22CU,John's Horror Corner,"[12, 18]","This is the story of a child from a sundered family seeking acceptance in an ancient, perhaps cursed, home whose impish inhabitants want to be her friends.  Guillermo del Toro did some great work with this movie.  The creatures were spooky, diminutive and off-putting works of CGI art.  The star victem was perfect as a nave, displaced child.  Even Katie Holmes did a good job (and I hate her, so that's hard for me to say).  Yet somehow del Toro's take on the movie (a remake of a 1973 TV-movie sensation) was just missing something.I was quite taken by the beguilingly creepy whispers of his evil shadow fairies.  I loved the set design and lighting effects.  I really enjoyed the attention to the mythology of his wee darklings.  But most of this was delivered to me in the first 15-30 minutes of the movie.  However enamoring this all was, I found myself waiting for something different to happen as the movie continued.  But all I found was more of the same, excepting that every creature encounter became more intense and revealed more of these evil lawn gnomes' intentions.  That, and for some reason their vulnerability to light seemed to change conveniently from one encounter to the next.I was entertained by this not-so-jumpy scare-film.  Anytime del Toro gets to share his ideas with creature effects teams it seems to work out great (Hellboy, Hellboy 2: The Golden Army, Pan's Labyrinth).  What was different about this film?  It relied on a single creature concept for 90 minutes.  Hellboy divided its attention between the demon-beast Samaal, the clockwork-assassin Cronin, Rasputin and the tentacular monster he becomes, and the star creature-characters and their nature and origins.  Pan's Labyrinth has a funky mantis-fairy, the faun, and one other monster which come up in different parts of the movie as if they are three stories.  Hellboy 2 was a cornucopia of ideas (one of which was linked to del Toro's childhood fear of dentists and tooth fairies like this movie).  All enchanted us with ideas linked to mythologies and dark origin stories in brevity.I think del Toro needs to take on a project that's a more serious take on episodics like Creepshow, Trick or Treat, or Tales from the Darkside.  These movies thrive on nifty single-serving story ideas, which seem to overflow from del Toro's beautifully twisted mind.",4,"A great story idea stretched, really, a bit too thin",1321747200,"11 20, 2011",2011,2342,"['story', 'child', 'sundered', 'family', 'seeking', 'acceptance', 'ancient', 'perhaps', 'cursed', 'home', 'impish', 'inhabitants', 'want', 'be', 'friends', 'Guillermo', 'del', 'Toro', 'did', 'great', 'work', 'movie', 'creatures', 'were', 'spooky', 'diminutive', 'off-putting', 'works', 'CGI', 'art', 'star', 'victem', 'was', 'perfect', 'nave', 'displaced', 'child', 'Even', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'hate', 'hard', 'say', 'somehow', 'del', 'Toro', 'take', 'movie', 'remake', '1973', 'TV-movie', 'sensation', 'was', 'just', 'missing', 'something.I', 'was', 'quite', 'taken', 'beguilingly', 'creepy', 'whispers', 'evil', 'shadow', 'fairies', 'loved', 'set', 'design', 'lighting', 'effects', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'attention', 'mythology', 'wee', 'darklings', 'most', 'was', 'delivered', 'first', '15-30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'However', 'enamoring', 'was', 'found', 'waiting', 'something', 'different', 'happen', 'movie', 'continued', 'found', 'was', 'more', 'same', 'excepting', 'creature', 'encounter', 'became', 'more', 'intense', 'revealed', 'more', 'evil', 'lawn', 'gnomes', 'intentions', 'reason', 'vulnerability', 'light', 'seemed', 'change', 'conveniently', 'one', 'encounter', 'next.I', 'was', 'entertained', 'not-so-jumpy', 'scare-film', 'Anytime', 'del', 'Toro', 'share', 'ideas', 'creature', 'effects', 'teams', 'work', 'out', 'great', 'Hellboy', 'Hellboy', '2', 'Golden', 'Army', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'What', 'was', 'different', 'film', 'relied', 'single', 'creature', 'concept', '90', 'minutes', 'Hellboy', 'divided', 'attention', 'demon-beast', 'Samaal', 'clockwork-assassin', 'Cronin', 'Rasputin', 'tentacular', 'monster', 'star', 'creature-characters', 'nature', 'origins', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'funky', 'mantis-fairy', 'faun', 'one', 'other', 'monster', 'come', 'up', 'different', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'three', 'stories', '2', 'was', 'cornucopia', 'ideas', 'one', 'was', 'linked', 'del', 'Toro', 'childhood', 'fear', 'dentists', 'tooth', 'fairies', 'movie', 'enchanted', 'ideas', 'linked', 'mythologies', 'dark', 'origin', 'stories', 'brevity.I', 'think', 'del', 'Toro', 'take', 'project', 'more', 'serious', 'take', 'episodics', 'Creepshow', 'Trick', 'Treat', 'Tales', 'Darkside', 'movies', 'thrive', 'nifty', 'single-serving', 'story', 'ideas', 'seem', 'overflow', 'del', 'Toro', 'beautifully', 'twisted', 'mind']",N/A
1503608,A3N0LBOUQAD1BG,B005TK22CU,"Jonnathan Ritland ""Hank Peters, Italian Grocer""","[1, 2]","(Possible Spoilers)There's an old mansion where some people were killed and without knowing this its being restored by Alex Hurst (Guy Pearce, ""Memento"") and new love Kim (Katie Holmes, ""Batman Begins""). Alex's young daughter Sally comes along to stay at the house with them while its being restored, she doesn't like Kim at all and doesn't take to being in a new house very well either. Oh did I forget to mention there's some small imp like demons in the bowels of the house that like to feast on the teeth of children cause if I did thats kinda central to the story.As expected Sally starts exploring and of course begins communicating with said imp demons and they tell her ""They're hungry"", which prompts Sally to try to warn her dad and Kim but as is usual with these films its too hard for those in danger to listen to the one person who knows about any trouble coming. At least not until it gets totally out of control and the demons start really coming for everyone in the house.Producer Guillermo Del Toro always seems to have a knack for adding some spice to films he's involved in whether its as a producer here or in an actual good suspense film like ""The Orphanage"" or as a director in ""Pan's Labyrinth"". Here he helps produce and co-writes the screenplay for director Troy Nixey in his feature film debut, so there's some good Del Toro ideas here to mask the plot holes and hokey portions of the movie.The visuals are fairly impressive, a good amount of the ideas work and for it being his debut film Nixey shows some at the very least decent directing chops. As for the acting its pretty bare bones Sally's the usual young girl in an old house with demons, Pearce is stereotypical as the working dad and Holmes just hasn't seemed like the same person since her marriage to Tom Cruise (my opinion though). However again thanks to Del Toro being involved its a step above most films in this genre. **1/2 out of 4 stars.",4,Don't be afraid just aware of the dark.....,1339977600,"06 18, 2012",2012,1933,"['Possible', 'Spoilers', 'old', 'mansion', 'where', 'people', 'were', 'killed', 'knowing', 'being', 'restored', 'Alex', 'Hurst', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Memento', 'new', 'love', 'Kim', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Alex', 'young', 'daughter', 'Sally', 'along', 'stay', 'house', 'being', 'restored', ""n't"", 'like', 'Kim', ""n't"", 'take', 'being', 'new', 'house', 'very', 'well', 'either', 'Oh', 'did', 'forget', 'mention', 'small', 'imp', 'demons', 'bowels', 'house', 'feast', 'teeth', 'children', 'cause', 'did', 'thats', 'kinda', 'central', 'story.As', 'expected', 'Sally', 'exploring', 'course', 'communicating', 'said', 'imp', 'demons', 'tell', ""'re"", 'hungry', 'Sally', 'try', 'warn', 'dad', 'Kim', 'usual', 'films', 'too', 'hard', 'danger', 'listen', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'trouble', 'coming', 'least', 'not', 'totally', 'control', 'demons', 'start', 'really', 'coming', 'everyone', 'house.Producer', 'Guillermo', 'Del', 'Toro', 'always', 'have', 'knack', 'adding', 'spice', 'films', 'involved', 'producer', 'here', 'actual', 'good', 'suspense', 'film', 'Orphanage', 'director', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'Here', 'produce', 'co-writes', 'screenplay', 'director', 'Troy', 'Nixey', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'good', 'Del', 'Toro', 'ideas', 'here', 'mask', 'plot', 'holes', 'hokey', 'portions', 'movie.The', 'visuals', 'are', 'fairly', 'impressive', 'good', 'amount', 'ideas', 'work', 'being', 'debut', 'film', 'Nixey', 'very', 'least', 'decent', 'directing', 'chops', 'acting', 'pretty', 'bare', 'Sally', 'usual', 'young', 'girl', 'old', 'house', 'demons', 'Pearce', 'stereotypical', 'working', 'dad', 'Holmes', 'just', ""n't"", 'seemed', 'same', 'person', 'marriage', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'opinion', 'However', 'again', 'thanks', 'Del', 'Toro', 'being', 'involved', 'step', 'most', 'films', 'genre', '**1/2', '4', 'stars']",N/A
1503609,A1VF0102Z9VITO,B005TK22CU,Joseph M. Reninger,"[5, 7]","This remake of the 1970s TV movie has been a pet project of Guillermo del Toro for over a decade. He saw the original as a child and it scared him witless. The original story follows a young wife who is tormented by little demon creatures who want to make her one of them. I haven't seen it but have it on good authority that it is quite excellent and worth seeing.This movie changes the female protagonist to a nine- or ten-year old girl named Sally who has been sent by her mom to live with her dad and his live-in girlfriend. They are fixing up a house on the east coast. There's a lot of family awkwardness that fuels the girl's feelings of loneliness and abandonment. So when she starts hearing voices calling her to come play in the basement, maybe it isn't so strange that she wants to find out who these new friends might be.Sally doesn't realize how bad an idea it is because she missed the opening of the film, set over 100 years before she arrived. The previous home owner went crazy trying to get his son back from the little demons who live in the ashpit under the house. They wanted children's teeth in exchange for the son. He offers his own and we (mostly) see him collect teeth from his housemaid. That scene was pretty traumatic and horrifying, showing just enough to make it all the more terrifying.The movie never really maintains the level of dread set at the beginning. Sure, moments are scary and the creatures are nasty looking. But the creatures do not seem so overwhelming, even in large numbers. Their success seems to rely on people being stunned into inaction by their presence, or being tripped and knocked semi- or completely unconscious. And they flee light, which seems like a very easy weapon to have or use more effectively than the characters in the movie make use of.Some bits are hard to believe, like the skeptical father who still won't believe his daughter is seeing little creatures even after the caretaker has been attacked and, later, the daughter has taken a picture (which he doesn't bother to look at). The demons' voices inviting Sally to join them are throaty and threatening, making me wonder why Sally wasn't more skeptical herself.Some bits are quite enjoyable. The house is quite beautiful--gothic without being a sinister haunted house like you see in so many other movies. The interiors are warm and original. Only the basement is cold and unnerving. I thought the creatures looked pretty convincing. Many scenes and props reminded me of other movies (especially other del Toro movies like Pan's Labyrinth) but not in a bad, rip-off way. It was more like seeing bits from another movie and saying, ""Hey, I know where I've seen that before!"" That might be annoying to other viewers (and sometimes stuff like that is annoying to me).Overall, this movie was a mild disappointment, considering the source material and del Toro's involvement (he's one of my favorite current directors). I had heard a lot of negative reviews before seeing this, so my expectations were pretty low. If I'd seen it in the theater I would have been more disappointed. I can't really recommend it unless you are a die-hard fan of a cast member or one of the creators or the genre.DVD note: after seeing dozens of films that boast multiple hours of special features, it was nice to see a DVD that had at most 20 minutes of extras. Three featurettes described how the story was put together, how they made the exteriors and interiors of the house, and the development of the creatures from concept to finished film effects.",2,But Do Be Afraid of Disappointment,1333929600,"04 9, 2012",2012,3551,"['remake', '1970s', 'TV', 'movie', 'been', 'pet', 'project', 'Guillermo', 'del', 'Toro', 'decade', 'saw', 'original', 'child', 'scared', 'witless', 'original', 'story', 'young', 'wife', 'who', 'tormented', 'little', 'demon', 'creatures', 'who', 'want', 'make', 'one', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'have', 'good', 'authority', 'quite', 'excellent', 'worth', 'seeing.This', 'movie', 'female', 'protagonist', 'nine-', 'ten-year', 'old', 'girl', 'named', 'Sally', 'who', 'been', 'sent', 'mom', 'live', 'dad', 'live-in', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'fixing', 'up', 'house', 'east', 'coast', 'lot', 'family', 'awkwardness', 'girl', 'feelings', 'loneliness', 'abandonment', 'So', 'when', 'hearing', 'voices', 'calling', 'come', 'play', 'basement', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'so', 'strange', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'new', 'friends', 'might', 'be.Sally', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'bad', 'idea', 'missed', 'opening', 'film', 'set', '100', 'years', 'arrived', 'previous', 'home', 'owner', 'went', 'crazy', 'trying', 'get', 'son', 'back', 'little', 'demons', 'who', 'live', 'ashpit', 'house', 'wanted', 'children', 'teeth', 'exchange', 'son', 'own', 'mostly', 'see', 'collect', 'teeth', 'housemaid', 'scene', 'was', 'pretty', 'traumatic', 'horrifying', 'showing', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'more', 'terrifying.The', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'level', 'dread', 'set', 'beginning', 'Sure', 'moments', 'are', 'scary', 'creatures', 'are', 'nasty', 'looking', 'creatures', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'so', 'overwhelming', 'even', 'large', 'numbers', 'success', 'rely', 'people', 'being', 'stunned', 'inaction', 'presence', 'being', 'tripped', 'knocked', 'semi-', 'completely', 'unconscious', 'flee', 'light', 'very', 'easy', 'weapon', 'have', 'use', 'more', 'effectively', 'characters', 'movie', 'make', 'use', 'of.Some', 'bits', 'are', 'hard', 'believe', 'skeptical', 'father', 'who', 'still', 'wo', ""n't"", 'believe', 'daughter', 'seeing', 'little', 'creatures', 'even', 'caretaker', 'been', 'attacked', 'later', 'daughter', 'taken', 'picture', ""n't"", 'bother', 'look', 'demons', 'voices', 'inviting', 'Sally', 'join', 'are', 'throaty', 'threatening', 'making', 'wonder', 'why', 'Sally', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'skeptical', 'herself.Some', 'bits', 'are', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'house', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'gothic', 'being', 'sinister', 'haunted', 'house', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'interiors', 'are', 'warm', 'original', 'Only', 'basement', 'cold', 'unnerving', 'thought', 'creatures', 'looked', 'pretty', 'convincing', 'Many', 'scenes', 'props', 'reminded', 'other', 'movies', 'especially', 'other', 'del', 'Toro', 'movies', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'not', 'bad', 'rip-off', 'way', 'was', 'more', 'seeing', 'bits', 'movie', 'saying', 'Hey', 'know', 'where', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before', 'might', 'be', 'annoying', 'other', 'viewers', 'sometimes', 'stuff', 'annoying', '.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'mild', 'disappointment', 'considering', 'source', 'material', 'del', 'Toro', 'involvement', 'one', 'favorite', 'current', 'directors', 'had', 'heard', 'lot', 'negative', 'reviews', 'seeing', 'expectations', 'were', 'pretty', 'low', ""'d"", 'seen', 'theater', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'disappointed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'are', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'cast', 'member', 'one', 'creators', 'genre.DVD', 'note', 'seeing', 'dozens', 'films', 'boast', 'multiple', 'hours', 'special', 'features', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'DVD', 'had', 'most', '20', 'minutes', 'extras', 'Three', 'featurettes', 'described', 'how', 'story', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'how', 'made', 'exteriors', 'interiors', 'house', 'development', 'creatures', 'concept', 'finished', 'film', 'effects']",N/A

1503613,A3TMS14RL9Q0R1,B005TK22CU,"K. Sommerfield ""Slasher Studios""","[74, 88]","As I start my review for ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"" I must confess one thing: I'm not a fan of supernatural horror movies. While I admire haunted house films like ""Poltergeist"", I've always found this sub-genre of horror to be painfully dull and its characters to be agonizingly stupid (""The Amityville Horror"", I'm looking at you). They usually have the same formula: a stupid, yuppie couple (occasionally with children) buy a house, move in, hear strange noises, and bad things happen. Rinse and repeat. So, going into ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"", my expectations were pretty low. After reading some not so positive reviews online, they sank even further. So is ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"" worth screaming for? Well..more on that in a bit.The film begins with a gruesome prologue shows the home's deranged first owner, Emerson Blackwood, luring his maid into the dungeon-like basement and performing medieval dentistry on the terrified young woman. As he carries out the atrocity, he explains to the young maid that they, the goblin-like creatures known as Homunculi, have taken his son and will only give him back with teeth. As the young woman screams, whispering can be heard all around the room from the sealed up fireplace. Blackwood makes his way over to the fireplace and offers the teeth in exchange for the return of his son, only to be told his offering wasn't acceptable and he is pulled into the fireplace. The basement is sealed and forgotten over the generations.The movie then opens with a young girl, Sally Hirst (Bailee Madison), moving into Blackwood Manor, the Gothic mansion being restored by her architect father Alex (Guy Pearce) and his girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes), an interior decorator. Her father is renovating the house they live in, in hopes of having it on the front page of a known magazine. Due to the fact that her mother recently abandoned her, Sally has become a distant child with emotional vulnerability. Although Kim tries to befriend her, Sally alienates herself from her.One day, Sally hears voices calling her name and follows them -- finding a hidden basement with a fireplace that has been bolted shut. She is drawn toward the fireplace, as she can hear voices that beg her to open it, promising friendship. One day she sneaks into the basement to open the fireplace, but her father stops her before she can get the door completely open. The Homunculi escape, however, and begin to torment Sally at night telling her to turn the lights out.As the days progress, Kim finds one of her dresses shredded. Shortly afterward, a teddy bear that Kim gave to Sally is found destroyed underneath her bed after she yelled for her Dad having been scared by the creatures. Sally claims that someone (or something) else is to blame for these things, but her father does not believe her and is preoccupied with renovating the house. Kim, however, begins to believe her claims, as strange incidents occur more frequently. But is it too late?""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"" is over-the-top, melodramatic, and full of plot holes. But, you know what dear reader, I loved every minute of it. This is the kind of movie in which logic is thrown out the door before the opening credits even begin. It is atmospheric in a way that has been missing from most horror movies today. Those that were disappointed by the lack of Gothic overtones in the ""Fright Night"" remake will be in Heaven here. The sets are gorgeous and the fluid use of cinematography is inviting in a way that makes you feel at home with these gawkily little creatures. The acting here is a bit hit or miss. Guy Pearce is terrible as the father who doesn't seem to care whether his girlfriend or his daughter lives or dies. His performance is bland to the point of sleepwalking through his role. Katie Holmes, on the other hand, is a revelation. It's nice to see a strong, female role in which she is neither helpless nor a shrewd bitch. She thoroughly blew me away and has a few very touching scenes with Madison. Madison makes for a convincingly scared child but her performance is a bit hit or miss.

(I will confess that I am no fan of &#34;Pan's Labyrinth&#34;--a film that should have been more frightening, and less concerned with graphic violence, than it ultimately was.) The casting of Katie Holmes might be the only caveat for the critic, because overall I found the film to be frightening and enjoyable. Ostensibly based upon the 1973 TV feature of the same title (del Toro still refers to it as one of his personal favorites), &#34;Don't Be Afraid of the Dark&#34; succeeds beautifully in the areas of art direction, pacing, suspenseful story construction, music scoring, and script writing--so what's to complain about? I don't give it five stars--because there were some special effects efforts that could have been less computeresque--but for the most part I'd rather watch this film than most other horror efforts as of late (with the exception of anything &#34;Exorcist&#34;-related). I especially enjoyed the literary linking to the fictions of Welshman Arthur Machen (a legendary 'weird' fiction writer if there ever was a pre-Lovecraftian one), and, to me, the film is ultimately more about fear than it is about horror--nonetheless, the effect is still quite horrific! By the way, this does not operate on real-world logic, but rather fairy tale logic, and the whole film was spooky, involving, with many creepy scenes, and a lot of interesting mythological background to suggest the terrors that await in the shadows.The single-disc DVD is quite good in the presentation, very nice picture transfer (in widescreen--get this version!), and a great sound separation on the stereo track. The bonus feature (which includes an interview with del Toro) is quite nice, although by no means in depth.

1503622,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B005TK22CU,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 4]","""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"" is Guillermo del Toro's remake of a 1973 made-for-TV film about goblin creatures stalking a mansion.  On the surface it's a typical monsterfest about a lone child against miniature horrors in the vein of ""Gremlins,"" but its horror lineage goes back as far as Arthur Machen, Algernon Blackwood, and H.P. Lovecraft.The first hint that del Toro knows his horror history is the film's location, set in Emerson Blackwood's (Garry McDonald) Manor in Providence County, Rhode Island. Blackwood is an allusion to Algernon Blackwood, named by H.P. Lovecraft in his essay ""Supernatural Horror in Literature"" as one of the ""four modern masters of horror"" along with Arthur Machen, One of Machen's most famous works is the short story ""The Wendigo,"" which introduces a spiritual contagion capable of turning ordinary people into monsters.  And of course, Providence was Lovecraft's home for most of his life.8-year old Sally Hurst (Bailee Madison) is a trouble child shuttled between her two parents, her mother on the West Coast, her father on the East.  Unbeknownst to Sally, she has been packed off to live with her father Alex (Guy Pearce) and his girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes), who are restoring Blackwood Manor to put it on the market for their client Mr. Jacoby (Alan Dale). It's not long before the creatures that lurk in the Manor begin whispering to Sally, calling to her and giving her gifts in exchange for teeth belonging to the previous owner.DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE SPOILERS: The plot unfolds like a Lovecraft tale: an ancient manor, a dark legacy, and the Gothic body, the devolution of the humanoid form into something monstrous. There are allusions to fairies as something to be feared, introduced in Machen's ""The White People."" Like the author of the Green Book's diary, Sally is led to a secret wood by a woman who is not her mother (Kim) and discovers a hollow pit in which young girls are carried away never to be seen again.The creatures replenish their number through kidnapping and conversion, and if you look closely enough you can see Emerson's features in the leader of the homunculi. The parallels to Lovecraft's ""Rats in the Walls"" are many, including a sub-cellar with letters inscribed over it (in this film, ""Be Afraid"" is written in Elder Futhark), an ancient cult of sacrifice, and hideous, flabby, degenerate abhumans who feast on the living.Madison is a versatile actress, effortlessly swinging from sulking to terrified as the movie dictates.  Pearce plays Alex as unlikable, but that's on purpose, with only Holmes' Kim lending a sympathetic ear.  Holmes is surprisingly good here, using her horrified expressions to convey her disbelief as the events unfold. Unfortunately, the film's editing leaves much to be desired.  Key plot points are portrayed visually that might have been better served through exposition -- it's unclear exactly how the homunculi work, what they want, and who qualifies as a sacrifice. And then exposition is dumped in great heaping quantities by a suspiciously garrulous librarian. The ending, while suitably downbeat, has a denouement that that doesn't explain the sudden disappearance of one of the characters.Despite its plot holes, ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"" is an entertaining grim fairytale that promises you'll never look at the Tooth Fairy the same way again.",4,A horror legacy from the modern masters,1337472000,"05 20, 2012",2012,3355,"['Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'Guillermo', 'del', 'Toro', 'remake', '1973', 'made-for-TV', 'film', 'goblin', 'creatures', 'stalking', 'mansion', 'surface', 'typical', 'monsterfest', 'lone', 'child', 'miniature', 'horrors', 'vein', 'Gremlins', 'horror', 'lineage', 'back', 'as', 'far', 'Arthur', 'Machen', 'Algernon', 'Blackwood', 'H.P', 'Lovecraft.The', 'first', 'hint', 'Toro', 'horror', 'history', 'film', 'location', 'set', 'Emerson', 'Blackwood', 'Garry', 'McDonald', 'Manor', 'Providence', 'County', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'Blackwood', 'allusion', 'Algernon', 'Blackwood', 'named', 'H.P', 'Lovecraft', 'essay', 'Supernatural', 'Horror', 'Literature', 'one', 'four', 'modern', 'masters', 'horror', 'Arthur', 'Machen', 'One', 'Machen', 'most', 'famous', 'works', 'short', 'story', 'Wendigo', 'spiritual', 'contagion', 'capable', 'turning', 'ordinary', 'people', 'monsters', 'course', 'Providence', 'was', 'Lovecraft', 'home', 'most', 'life.8-year', 'old', 'Sally', 'Hurst', 'Bailee', 'Madison', 'trouble', 'child', 'shuttled', 'two', 'parents', 'mother', 'West', 'Coast', 'father', 'East', 'Unbeknownst', 'Sally', 'been', 'packed', 'off', 'live', 'father', 'Alex', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'girlfriend', 'Kim', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'who', 'are', 'restoring', 'Blackwood', 'Manor', 'put', 'market', 'client', 'Mr.', 'Jacoby', 'Alan', 'Dale', 'not', 'long', 'creatures', 'lurk', 'Manor', 'begin', 'whispering', 'Sally', 'calling', 'giving', 'gifts', 'exchange', 'teeth', 'belonging', 'previous', 'owner.DO', ""N'T"", 'BE', 'AFRAID', 'THE', 'SPOILERS', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'Lovecraft', 'tale', 'ancient', 'manor', 'dark', 'legacy', 'Gothic', 'body', 'devolution', 'humanoid', 'form', 'something', 'monstrous', 'are', 'allusions', 'fairies', 'something', 'be', 'feared', 'introduced', 'Machen', 'White', 'People', 'author', 'Green', 'Book', 'diary', 'Sally', 'led', 'secret', 'wood', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'mother', 'Kim', 'hollow', 'pit', 'young', 'girls', 'are', 'carried', 'away', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again.The', 'creatures', 'replenish', 'number', 'kidnapping', 'conversion', 'look', 'closely', 'can', 'see', 'Emerson', 'features', 'leader', 'homunculi', 'parallels', 'Lovecraft', 'Rats', 'Walls', 'are', 'many', 'including', 'sub-cellar', 'letters', 'inscribed', 'film', 'Be', 'Afraid', 'written', 'Elder', 'Futhark', 'ancient', 'cult', 'sacrifice', 'hideous', 'flabby', 'degenerate', 'abhumans', 'who', 'feast', 'living.Madison', 'versatile', 'actress', 'effortlessly', 'swinging', 'sulking', 'terrified', 'movie', 'Pearce', 'Alex', 'unlikable', 'purpose', 'only', 'Holmes', 'Kim', 'lending', 'sympathetic', 'ear', 'Holmes', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'here', 'using', 'horrified', 'expressions', 'convey', 'disbelief', 'events', 'unfold', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'editing', 'leaves', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'Key', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'portrayed', 'visually', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'exposition', 'unclear', 'exactly', 'how', 'homunculi', 'work', 'what', 'want', 'who', 'sacrifice', 'then', 'exposition', 'dumped', 'great', 'heaping', 'quantities', 'suspiciously', 'garrulous', 'librarian', 'ending', 'suitably', 'downbeat', 'denouement', ""n't"", 'explain', 'sudden', 'disappearance', 'one', 'characters.Despite', 'plot', 'holes', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'entertaining', 'grim', 'fairytale', ""'ll"", 'never', 'look', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'same', 'way', 'again']",N/A

1503627,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B005TK22CU,M. Oleson,"[4, 6]","In 1973, ABC Television presented a made-for-TV movie starring Kim Darby and Jim Hutton in the first version of this story.  For some reason, Guillermo del Toro and the folks a Miramax Films thought it should be remade. Mr. del Toro has had some success with films of this genre including ""The Orphanage"", ""Hellboy"" (I and II) and the brilliant ""Pan's Labyrinth.""  It is not surprising then that the art decoration and sets are first class.  The old house is sufficiently large and creepy even though it is undergoing renovation.  This time the directing chores are performed by rookie Troy Nixie.The problem with the film is that it just isn't very scary.  Bailee Madison plays Sally, a girl of about 11 or 12, who is being foisted on her divorced dad by a mom (never seen) who has had enough of Sally's behavior problems.  Sally sets the stage early on by gobbling Adderal and getting caught lying several times.  So for the rest of the movie we know that no one will believe anything she says.  Dad (Guy Pearce) has a new live-in girlfriend (Katie Holmes) and together they have invested everything they have into the restoration.  This of course means their focus is not on Sally's stories but on getting the house in ""Architectural Digest.""The house is haunted, but not by traditional ghosts.  Here we have little 10 inch thin skinned humanoids with small heads and sharp teeth.  Oh yes, the teeth.  Evidently that is what they use for sustenance.  Children's teeth are best.  There is a history of lost children and adults that is shown in the opening sequence, which is actually pretty good.  Kim (Holmes) eventually comes around and believes Sally's tales of creatures.  Kim gives Sally a Polaroid flash camera (yeah, when's the last time you saw one of those?) to get a picture and protect herself (the creatures don't like bright lights).  We know exactly what is going to happen from one scene to the next.  This is a by-the-numbers haunted house film that I suspect will also be on TV pretty soon.This Blu ray version also contains a digital transfer.  The video is excellent.  The dark scenes still stand out.

The movie was fun, it was entertaining but I wasn't surprised or impressed with anything. It was a usual story, with usual acting, and a somewhat disappointing ending.The little creatures were very cool and looked great. It has a very cool story, however they didn't use it the why they could have. It had a lot of potential and didn't use it the best they could.Acting seemed a little off at times. The casting ended up disappointing me, even though that is what interested me in the movie. There were other times where the movie and acting felt rushed, like the director said, ""ok, let's get this scene over with so we can all go to lunch.""The clarity of the Blu-ray is great. Very clean and crisp. The audio is also great as there are many creaks and cracks in the surrounds as well as the shrieks and whispers of the little monsters. Extras are nothing out of the ordinary and didn't really impress me, but still nice to have.Over-all it was a fun movie which uses darkness and creepiness as the main attention grabber.

1503634,A3TD7HLTDWZ382,B005TK22CU,"Pikminfan ""bobsworld3""","[3, 5]","Spoilers to follow, so if you haven't seen the movie-it's best to ignore this review.  I thought ""Don't be afraid of the Dark"" was a good looking and entertaining enough movie that was well acted and had a great premise.  Plus Katie Holmes is pretty darn adorable so it had that going for it too.  :)  The creatures in this film were also pretty great-original and creepy looking, not quite humanoid, but not entirely rat-like either, something of a mix instead.  Though there was nothing really ""bad"" about ""Don't be Afraid of the Dark"" when all was said and done, it was just sort of ""okay"".  Sadly it failed to rise above mediocrity even though there was so much potential to have made it into something special and unique.I feel they missed the boat on this film mostly on two fronts.  First off, it's really not very scary at all.  In not one scene did I really feel that the creatures were that that malevolent and dangerous.  Sure they carry around razors or scissors or what have you, but in any pack, strength lies in numbers and for the majority of the time, most of the individuals just sort of stood around doing nothing instead of swarming their victims when there was ample time and opportunity to do so (now THAT would've been scary).  The bath tub scene for instance should have been absolutely terrifying.  The creatures could've easily gotten the girl.  (I guess they didn't have their heart in it) Instead, there's no real sense of danger, therefore that particular scene (and the film in general) just wasn't that frightening.  The second missed opportunity was what sort of story potential that could've been had with Sally's ""proof"" of the creatures existence (since no one seemed to believe her).  But the film makers didn't even bother show the Polaroids she took (and there were many) nor did any of the film's characters bother to notice the mangled bodies (or tiny detached arm) of the creatures Sally smashed with the book case (which I must admit that particular scene got a ""boo-yah!"" out of me).  So all of this craziness is going on, Katie Holmes character is starting to believe young Sally and no one checks the house for the scattered polaroids or dead bodies?I liked ""Don't be Afraid of the Dark"" because it's my kind of movie and I love when horror films feature some sort of creature or creatures as the antagonist (I count the Alien films, Gremlins & Tremors among some of my favorites).  Though this film had so much going for it, it really just didn't play up on those strengths and it's a shame.  It's still a decent way to spend two hours, but man this film could've really been something.  I do have to admit though, the thought of what becomes of Katie Holmes character Kim in the very end is pretty intriguing and unexpected.  Though again-it was another missed opportunity not to show that character newly transformed.  I also would have loved for the father and daughter to have ventured down into the cave to try and rescue Kim so we could've gotten a glimpse of the world the creatures inhabited.  Alas I guess it was not meant too be and that's really unfortunate.",3,So much missed potential,1332979200,"03 29, 2012",2012,3115,"['Spoilers', 'follow', 'so', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie-it', 'best', 'ignore', 'review', 'thought', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'Dark', 'was', 'good', 'looking', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'had', 'great', 'premise', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'pretty', 'darn', 'adorable', 'had', 'going', 'too', 'creatures', 'film', 'were', 'also', 'pretty', 'great-original', 'creepy', 'looking', 'not', 'quite', 'humanoid', 'not', 'entirely', 'rat-like', 'something', 'mix', 'instead', 'was', 'nothing', 'really', 'bad', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'was', 'just', 'sort', 'okay', 'Sadly', 'failed', 'rise', 'mediocrity', 'even', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'have', 'made', 'something', 'special', 'unique.I', 'feel', 'missed', 'boat', 'film', 'mostly', 'two', 'fronts', 'First', 'really', 'not', 'very', 'scary', 'not', 'one', 'scene', 'did', 'really', 'feel', 'creatures', 'were', 'malevolent', 'dangerous', 'Sure', 'carry', 'razors', 'scissors', 'what', 'have', 'pack', 'strength', 'lies', 'numbers', 'majority', 'time', 'most', 'individuals', 'just', 'sort', 'stood', 'doing', 'nothing', 'instead', 'swarming', 'victims', 'when', 'was', 'ample', 'time', 'opportunity', 'do', 'so', 'now', 'THAT', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'scary', 'bath', 'tub', 'scene', 'instance', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'absolutely', 'terrifying', 'creatures', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'gotten', 'girl', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'heart', 'Instead', 'real', 'sense', 'danger', 'therefore', 'particular', 'scene', 'film', 'general', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'frightening', 'second', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'was', 'what', 'sort', 'story', 'potential', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'had', 'Sally', 'proof', 'creatures', 'existence', 'one', 'seemed', 'believe', 'film', 'makers', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'show', 'Polaroids', 'took', 'were', 'many', 'did', 'film', 'characters', 'bother', 'notice', 'mangled', 'bodies', 'tiny', 'detached', 'arm', 'creatures', 'Sally', 'smashed', 'book', 'case', 'must', 'admit', 'particular', 'scene', 'got', 'boo-yah', 'craziness', 'going', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'character', 'starting', 'believe', 'young', 'Sally', 'one', 'house', 'scattered', 'polaroids', 'dead', 'bodies', 'liked', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'kind', 'movie', 'love', 'when', 'horror', 'films', 'feature', 'sort', 'creature', 'creatures', 'antagonist', 'count', 'Alien', 'films', 'Gremlins', 'Tremors', 'favorites', 'film', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'really', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'up', 'strengths', 'shame', 'still', 'decent', 'way', 'spend', 'two', 'hours', 'man', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'really', 'been', 'something', 'do', 'have', 'admit', 'thought', 'what', 'becomes', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'character', 'Kim', 'very', 'end', 'pretty', 'intriguing', 'unexpected', 'again-it', 'was', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'not', 'show', 'character', 'newly', 'transformed', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'father', 'daughter', 'have', 'ventured', 'down', 'cave', 'try', 'rescue', 'Kim', 'could', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'glimpse', 'world', 'creatures', 'inhabited', 'Alas', 'guess', 'was', 'not', 'meant', 'too', 'be', 'really', 'unfortunate']",N/A
1503635,A2WFBIPVZFYDL5,B005TK22CU,"Randal Rauser ""The Tentative Apologist""","[1, 1]","What was Gulliermo Del Toro thinking? The director who gave us &#8220;Devil&#8217;s Backbone&#8221; and &#8221;Pan&#8217;s Labyrinth&#8221; came up with this? (Del Toro is writer and producer while Troy Nixey directed.) The film has received some positive reviews from a few critics, most notably from Roger Ebert. Pay no attention to that. Pay attention to the C- grade from Cinemascore. (Cinemascore is a market research firm that does immediate exit polling of average movie goers. Thus it provides a summary of a real audience&#8217;s reaction to a film. Sometimes cinemascore grades are unreliable because the audience is skewed: case in point the high grades given to the Transformers series. But in this case where you have a diverse, relatively educated audience, they&#8217;re bang on. And a C- is very low as a CinemaScore.)Now before I continue, let me address the big issue: why not listen to Ebert rather than me? After all, he won a Pulitzer Prize. That definitely trumps the teaching award I received in 2005. If I may, let me respond by pointing to C.S. Lewis&#8217;s comments in his Reflections on the Psalms. Lewis addressed the question of why you should read a literary critic who doesn&#8217;t know Hebrew on the Psalms. His answer was that sometimes a lack of specialist knowledge allows one to get at the essentials of a passage, unencumbered by the endless qualifications and clarifications that can come with specialist knowledge. I submit the same is true for my review. Ebert has more knowledge of cinema in his toenail shavings than I have in my cranium. But that fact actually helps me get to the nub of the issue for the average movie goer.And what is that nub?Here it is: the film is meant to be scary. It isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s boring. And endlessly silly. And a little bit funny. And if a film is meant to be scary but is actually boring and endlessly silly and a little bit funny then the deal is off. It&#8217;s like a handsome Italian sports car that won&#8217;t start. I don&#8217;t care how much you talk about the quality of the paint. I&#8217;m not interested.At this point be warned: spoilers may lay ahead. But if you&#8217;re still worried about spoilers at this point in the review then you haven&#8217;t been listening to a thing I&#8217;ve said.The film centers on a father (Guy Pearce) and his girlfriend (Katie Holmes) who are living in a scary old Victorian mansion when the father&#8217;s daughter (Bailee Madison) comes to live with them. Since I forget the names of the first two characters I&#8217;ll just call them Dad and Girlfriend. I can&#8217;t forget the daughter&#8217;s name (it is &#8220;Sally&#8221;) because the little gremlins in the walls keep whispering it over and over, apparently in a futile attempt to create some sense of impending doom. (The only sense of impending doom I felt related to the growing realization that I had wasted twenty bucks on tickets and popcorn.)Sally wanders the large, scary home and discovers a basement with a hearth that has things in it which keep doing the above mentioned whispering. When, eventually, you see the things doing the whispering you immediately wish you hadn&#8217;t. They look like little 8 inch ugly humanoid creatures with very bad teeth. As the film shamelessly depicts the little nasties running around wreaking havoc you begin to realize this is going to be about as scary as &#8220;Gremlins&#8221;.For me things definitely took a turn for the worst at the dinner party. It is meant to be an occasion for dad, an architect, to show off his handiwork of restoring the mansion to Architectural Digest. But as the guests arrive Sally has a Polaroid camera (yes a Polaroid. Did she buy it on Ebay?) and she takes a picture of one of the gremlins peaking out of a green plant. That reminded me of the opening scene of &#8220;Toy Story&#8221; where the toy soldiers are staking out the birthday party downstairs and providing reports back to Woody and the gang. And once I started thinking of that I went on to think how I wish Buzz Lightyear, Woody, and the rest of the gang were here to battle Sally&#8217;s gremlins. Now that would be entertaining.Anyway Dad doesn&#8217;t believe Sally about the gremlins. But Girlfriend suspects something might be up. So she goes to the local public library to do some research. I don&#8217;t  know about your local public library, but mine has primary colors, giant choo choo train decals, and a community announcements billboard. The local branch Girlfriend visits looks like the reading room from the Vatican Library. Impressive.While at the library Girlfriend discovers that these little gremlin creatures have been stealing human beings for centuries. But then at some point in the 900s the Pope, yes the same Pope that uses the real Vatican reading room, signed a treaty with the gremlins so that they would agree to take human teeth rather than human lives to satiate their desires or needs or whatever.Wait a minute. Don&#8217;t visualize that or you&#8217;ll burst into laughter. Am I supposed to envision an entourage of 8 inch gremlins arriving at the Vatican for a formal document signing ceremony? Like I said, this film is unintentionally funny.As events unfold Dad, Girlfriend, and yes poor Sally, all act very stupid. They might as well have covered themselves with honey before venturing into the Hundred Acre Wood. Don&#8217;t be surprised when you find Winnie the Pooh gumming your ankles. You deserve it.In the end Girlfriend is whisked away to certain doom down the hearth in a scene that reminded me of the ending in another recent film, &#8220;Drag me to hell.&#8221; Sally and Dad are spared however. Ironically their survival created the biggest chill of the entire film: the possibility of a sequel.randalrauser.com",2,Don't be afraid of this movie (unless you fear boredom),1389052800,"01 7,

1503638,A39W3263A9HCMN,B005TK22CU,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[2, 5]","You can always tell a good horror movie apart from a bad one. In a good one, there's an abundance of creepy suspense and tension throughout. The suspense is believable, the tension has you on the edge of your seat from the first frame to the last, and furthermore, the big scare that'll come every once in a blue moon is uncalled for, and effective, to point when it's not cheaply done. But what's even more Important that the characters are somewhat plausible.Unfortunately, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is not one of those.You know, I actually had not the slightest clue that this was a remake at all. In fact, much to my amazement, a look at the original movies page on IMDb and it has a huge fan base, apparently. I'm quite amazed, because I did not enjoy a single second of this boring sludge. Then again with it being a remake. I somewhat have the urge to find the original, because I'm curious to see if it really is that good.Essentially here we have the story of a girl named Sally, who is cute as a button, but her acting is the equivalent of a wooden chair. I get the circumstances surrounding her character, but you'd have thought she put some more effort into it. She ismpissed to be moving in with her asshat dad, played by Guy Pearce, who continues to suck at doing an American accent to the point where his acting is almost avant garde, and Katie Holmes, whose acting is like a robot.Sally moves in with her faux-American dad and his robotic girlfriend. They take advantage of the comfort of a lovely home, which was owned by a designer in the 1800s named Mr. Blackwood. The house is quite lovely, and Sally has a lovely bedroom, although she hates the house. One day, whole exploring the place, she stumbles upon a basement that the family didn't know was there. So they do some exploring... and Sally hears these voices from the ash pit. They claim they want to be her friends. This is her first mistake, she opens the ash pit.  But then that's not all. The creatures are free because of her.So therefore, the reason were supposed to feel scared is because of her stupidity. Yah-huh. And they terrorize the house, and they want her, and... Yeah.Raise your hand if you would have gotten spooked upon hearing the voices. Raise your hand if you would have just turned around and went upstairs. Raise your hand if you'd have taken the hint and would have just left them alone.The script is implausible, full of character stupidity, and just lame. The pacing is seriously awful. We get boring scene after boring scene of boring and unbelievable dialogs. Worse, the creatures are RE-TARD-ED. They look like crosses between geckos and monkeys, in fact, is there a special effects category for the razzies? Because these really are worthy of it. Oh, and the ending...was HORRIBLE!Quite simply put, I am glad the original must be good. I can't imagine this movie NOT being a remake, and not stinking as a result.OVERALL: 1/0Pros: well, it looks pretty...Cons: This movie is an exercise in the typical cliche of ""our characters must be stupid, otherwise it's not scary"".

She's a fine young actress, as shown in ""Brothers"" and ""The Bridge to Terabithia"". She does hysterics well. Unfortunately, one doesn't really care after a while.A solid performance by Katie Holmes is a plus, but Guy Pearce's character just isn't very likeable.

1503641,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B005TK22CU,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (Troy Nixey, 2010)Don't Be Afraid of the Dark didn't leave a huge impression on me, despite my having heard some pretty good things about it (and, of course, having Guillermo del Toro's name attached as a producer didn't hurt any). I certainly don't mean to imply that it is in any way a bad movie; there are far, far worse ways one can choose to kill ninety minutes, and I have reviewed more of those over the past twenty-eight years than I care to think about. But it felt more than once as if there was a great deal more that could have been done with this movie and never quite surfaced&#8212;with the end result being I found myself wondering on a few occasions if this wouldn't have been a better film if del Toro hadn't stepped into the director's chair. Talk about having your marketing backfire on you.Alex (Rules of Engagement's Guy Pearce) and his new girlfriend/business partner Kim (Go's Katie Holmes) take on a massive job&#8212;the renovation of the old Blackwood estate, which has lain empty since the previous owner and his son mysteriously went missing some time ago. Alex and Kim move into the old place and start designing, hoping to get it redecorated, then turn around and sell it. Through various machinations, Alex's daughter from a previous marriage, Sally (Bridge to Terabithia's Bailee Madison), comes to stay with them. Cure dysfunctional family drama. But in this house, there are worse things than not getting along with your stepmother. After all, in the opening scene, they dispensed with old Lord Blackwood...I should say at the outset that I haven't seen the 1973 original John Newland made-for-TV film. That may be affecting my reaction to this one, though I cannot say for certain whether the film's more violent detractors on various internet message boards generally fit that description. I did not have that same visceral reaction at all. In fact, as per the opening sentence of this review, I didn't have much of a reaction at all. Pearce and Holmes turned in competent performances, but brought their B games. That is relatively forgivable, since Madison is the real star of this show, but she seemed...pale. I don't want to say &#8220;anemic,&#8221; since she threw everything she had into the character of Sally, and seemed to be having a whale of a time doing it, which leads me to the conclusion that the problem was not with Madison, but with the script with which Madison was working. Del Toro is a known commodity, so let's look up co-writer Matthew Robbins, shall we? And here is the genesis of it all. For every Cronos del Toro has turned out, Robbins has given the world a Mimic.

I had no idea it was a remake of an old made-for-television movie that apparently was even better!I was actually well entertained by this film with it's real Gothic feel which, as other reviewers have pointed out, lots of horror films have been lacking these days.  You have creepy music, a huge creepy mansion, a creepy little girl, and creepy little creatures living in an old ash pit in the creepy basement.  What more could you ask for!?Well, better acting would be a good start.  The father is stiff and not very good.  Katie Holmes does a decent job, probably saving the film overall as the tough female character setting out to save everyone.  And Bailee Madison is the same grumpy little girl she's often been pegged to play in other films, but it pays off here because she's supposed to be a disturbed little girl being haunted by strange troll like characters that have been set free from the basement.The back story of the photographer/artist who lived in the old mansion and was also haunted by the little trolls is the perfect foundation for a good spooky film.  The introduction into the film showing his story set the tone perfectly.The ""creepy"" elements that I've pointed out definitely make this a fun film that provides lots of good scares.  My biggest problem with the film was a voice over by Katie's character done at the very very end of the film which was completely out of place.  Had they left that out, the film would have ended just fine and I probably would have given it four stars.

Her mother gives her to her father, Alex, like a baseball card and ships her far away from her home and friends. She has to live in a huge, gloomy house with Alex and his girlfriend, Kim. Introverted and quiet, Sally is miserable in the new house and just wants to go home. Her only solace is in the hidden basement she discovered while exploring. She hears voices call her name and opens a gateway that has held these creatures at bay for nearly a century. At first, they seem to just want to be her friend. After destroying Kim's things and brutally attacking a gardener, Sally realizes that they just want to manipulate and hurt her. Even after these strange incidences, Kim and her father don't believe her and think she's a disturbed little girl who needs a therapist. Can Sally convince them of the danger before it's too late?I had the wonderful opportunity to see an advanced screening of Don't Be Afraid of the Dark thanks to Screamfest. I went in expecting a cheesy ghost movie that would be a rip-off of Paranormal Activity or the Amityville Horror that I would not enjoy. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I was completely wrong. The film is actually a modern fairy tale with a lot of suspense mixed in. It starts off like a typical fairy tale with the unhappy daughter, stepmother, and father living together. Instead of an evil stepmother, Kim is actually very loving and the first person to believe Sally when she warns them about the menace in their house. She is more willing than Alex to get Sally out of harm's way even if it means losing money and prestige by cancelling an important dinner party. I like this role reversal from the typical fairy tale story. The reversal theme continues with the menacing creatures. They are fairies, which are typically the helpers to our young heroine, that have an affinity for teeth. Like the Tooth Fairy of my childhood, they leave money for teeth left underneath pillows, but they don't do this out of generosity. Their source of food is teeth and they especially like children's teeth. (For 2 clips with the tooth fairies, click here.) If you have seen Hellboy II, it's as if Guillermo del Toro took those tooth fairies, made them look a bit creepier, and gave them their own movie. Considering they were my favorite creature from that film, I am totally on board with this concept.Unlike many other horror films, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark relies heavily on suspense and dark ambiance over heavy gore and torture. A couple of scenes are squirm inducing, but mostly due to implication. The very first scene in the film features the man who originally built the house removing his own teeth and the teeth of a maid to appease the tooth fairies and get his son back. Even with this scene and one other that is particularly creepy, this film should not be rated R. There isn't much blood and there is no nudity, cursing, or anything else I can think of that would warrant such a rating. The house is beautiful and the perfect gothic setting for the story. The music by Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders enhances the creepy and haunting feel of the film. The architecture and the art of the original owner of the house are a perfect complement as well. The art was actually drawn by Keith Thompson, who also illustrated Scott Westerfeld's Leviathan series and he creates magic with just a black and white palette.The film, however, isn't perfect. A Polaroid camera is used extensively throughout the film. This may be a nod to the original version from the 70's, but a digital camera would have worked just as well. Plus Polaroid cameras aren't even made anymore, so it seems irrelevant in a modern film. The creatures' strengths and weaknesses fluctuated a lot throughout, from their numbers to the degree of their light sensitivity to their speed, without any real sense why. It seemed like if they had the same strength they had at the end, they could have easily won very early on, but then there would be no movie.

I liked it to a degree, finding the idea good and some of the execution interesting, but part of the movie flawed. The advertisements for this  really made it seems like it was going to be horror. If it were not for the Del Toro name being attached and knew it was a remake, I might have been annoyed because of what I expected.A little girl named Sally is forced to move into her father's (Alex) newest remodel and into the life of Alex and his girlfriend, Kim. After hearing a few discouraging things that Kim says when she thinks she's alone, Sally finds herself even more distraught, Feeling unloved, she mopes around the grounds and finds a room that supposedly does not exist. When Alex uncovers it, voices begin telling Sally to come into the basement, that they're her friends. Drawn in, she and her newly acquired family get more than they bargained for.The acting in the movie was pretty on, and the characters were likable enough. Sally, played by Bailee Madison, plays awkward really well, but I sometimes felt sorry for her parents because of the way she was portrayed. Kim, played by Katie Holmes, was better than i expected, and seemed to actually care about the kid after a while. Alex, plated by Guy Pierce, was done really well in my opinion. He seemed consumed with the house, his fortune sunk in, wondering why people were talking crazy.There was a lot of the original in the movie with a lot of modernization. That is good in some ways and bad in others. The set-up was nice. I loved that house and the mural and Blackwood's paintings. It had a fairytale quality to it that was simple and yet dark at the same time.  The effects were not bad, although I did question some things - like more of ""them"" not ending up dead. The storyline was simple enough, seemingly creepy at first but then devolving into a ""out to get you"" flick pretty quickly. It did explain away a few problems, like why Sally did not get hurt a lot worse, but it left some flaws inside as well.One thing I really wondered about was some of the reactions. Sally trashing a room with picture's mounted almost from the ceiling would have to seem odd, and things like the coin did not really add to the story itself (it did fit into the story, but I thought it might mean more to the parents). Then there was Kim's voice at the end, making me wonder why she was speaking at all. It seemed like they just added it for effect after-the-fact.All that said, I liked it enough to give it a 3.5 and to round it up to a 4. There were things in it i both liked and disliked, but i watched it more than once to see what was what. The DVD is pretty basic, if you are expecting something interesting.

1503660,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005TK22CU,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 5]","Guillermo del Toro of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" fame presents (not directs) ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark,"" a tepid horror remake directed by first-timer Troy Nixey. Based on the 1973 made-for-TV film starring Kim Darby, the new version looks like a text-book case of how not to make a horror movie.An 8-year-old girl Sally (Bailee Madison), her father Alex (Guy Pearce) and his girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes) start a new life in an old Rhode Island mansion once owned by a famous painter Emerson Blackwood (Garry McDonald) who went missing. Alex intends to repair and renovate the house of the renowned artist (one reason for them not to leave the place). But Sally senses there is something wrong with Blackwood Manor, hearing voices from somewhere below.It is not the film's worm-out storyline about a young girl in peril that disappointed me. It is the way the story is told that really destroyed everything in the movie. The film has no consistent inner logic, with hopelessly stupid characters making countless stupid decisions. If someone meets an ""accident"" in your house, you will ask him or her how it happened. If your daughter is scared of something, giving her a Polaroid camera is not a solution. Bland acting from usually reliable Guy Pearce doesn't help.Another problem of the film is that it shows too much, the same mistake that Jan de Bont's misguided remake of ""The Haunting"" committed. The scary entities (whatever they are) are most effective while staying in the dark.

Co-writers Guillermo Del Toro and Matthew Robbins use the original TV movie as the primary basis for this new version (although uncredited the 1973 script written by Nigel McKeand was reportedly based on H. P. Lovecraft's ""The Rats in the Walls"")altering the dynamic of the original script which didn't use a child as the main focus of the TV movie.Co-producer Guillermo Del Toro (""Hellboy"", ""Chronos"", ""Pan's Labyrinth"")and co-writer Matthew Robbins (""Dragonslayer"", ""*batteries not included"")along with first time director Troy Nixey create an impressive looking movie with some strong performances particularly from Baliee Madison. The main problem with ""Don't Be Afriad of the Dark"" is that despite the impressive production design, acting talent and moody photography ""Don't Be Afraid of The Dark"" isn't very scary.Sally (Madison) is a little girl who feels lost as she's shuffled off to live with her father Alex (Guy Pearce)and Alex's girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes) who specialize in renovating older, dilapited mansions. Sally discovers there are creatures living in the Blackwood home that abduct children.Unfortunately Pearce isn't given much to work with as Alex who primarily comes across as a twit and Katie Holmes character of Kim although written a bit more sympathetically doesn't have much depth either.The Blu-ray looks marvelous with a nicely detailed, moody presentation of the film. Skin tones are solid thorughout. Blacks are solid throughout and given that this is such a dark, moody looking film that's a good thing.Audio is very active particularly during the scenes where the little monsters attack with a nice DTS 5.1 lossless presentation.The special features include a featurette where Del Toro, Nixey and others discuss the challenges of adapting the original TV movie, altering the main focus to a child and then trying to create a thriller where the child isn't in more danger from the creatures.We also get a gallery of concept art but, given some of the commentary tracks that Del Toro has done in the past, I'm really surprised that Del Toro and director Nixey don't give us a commentary track explaining the often flawed creative decisions the trio of Del Toro, Robbins and Nixey made relating to their approach to the film. If they had stayed with the approach of the original TV movie of making an adult the focus of the film and putting the main characters in peril more often, ""Don't Be Afraid of The Dark"" MIGHT have lived up to its potential. As it is the film is a handsome looking, atmospheric thriller that's a victory of style over content.If you must see it, rent it first to make sure it will appeal to you.",2,"Although far from scary the ""Dark"" is atmospheric looking with nice production design",1327190400,"01 22, 2012",2012,2853,"['remake', '1973', 'TV', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'atmospheric', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'quite', 'deliver', 'promise', 'still', 'be', 'entertaining', 'even', 'tad', 'contrived', 'Co-writers', 'Guillermo', 'Del', 'Toro', 'Matthew', 'Robbins', 'use', 'original', 'TV', 'movie', 'primary', 'basis', 'new', 'version', 'uncredited', '1973', 'script', 'written', 'Nigel', 'McKeand', 'was', 'reportedly', 'based', 'H.', 'P.', 'Lovecraft', 'Rats', 'Walls', 'altering', 'dynamic', 'original', 'script', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'child', 'main', 'focus', 'TV', 'movie.Co-producer', 'Guillermo', 'Del', 'Toro', 'Hellboy', 'Chronos', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'co-writer', 'Matthew', 'Robbins', 'Dragonslayer', 'not', 'included', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Troy', 'Nixey', 'create', 'impressive', 'looking', 'movie', 'strong', 'performances', 'particularly', 'Baliee', 'Madison', 'main', 'problem', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Afriad', 'Dark', 'impressive', 'production', 'design', 'acting', 'talent', 'moody', 'photography', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Afraid', 'Dark', ""n't"", 'very', 'scary.Sally', 'Madison', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'lost', 'shuffled', 'off', 'live', 'father', 'Alex', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Alex', 'girlfriend', 'Kim', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'who', 'specialize', 'renovating', 'older', 'dilapited', 'mansions', 'Sally', 'discovers', 'are', 'creatures', 'living', 'Blackwood', 'home', 'children.Unfortunately', 'Pearce', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'work', 'as', 'Alex', 'who', 'primarily', 'across', 'twit', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'character', 'Kim', 'written', 'bit', 'more', 'sympathetically', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'depth', 'Blu-ray', 'marvelous', 'nicely', 'detailed', 'moody', 'presentation', 'film', 'Skin', 'tones', 'are', 'solid', 'thorughout', 'Blacks', 'are', 'solid', 'given', 'such', 'dark', 'moody', 'looking', 'film', 'good', 'thing.Audio', 'very', 'active', 'particularly', 'scenes', 'where', 'little', 'monsters', 'attack', 'nice', 'DTS', '5.1', 'lossless', 'presentation.The', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'featurette', 'where', 'Del', 'Toro', 'Nixey', 'others', 'discuss', 'challenges', 'adapting', 'original', 'TV', 'movie', 'altering', 'main', 'focus', 'child', 'then', 'trying', 'create', 'thriller', 'where', 'child', ""n't"", 'more', 'danger', 'creatures.We', 'also', 'get', 'gallery', 'concept', 'art', 'given', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'Del', 'Toro', 'done', 'past', ""'m"", 'really', 'surprised', 'Del', 'Toro', 'director', 'Nixey', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'commentary', 'track', 'explaining', 'often', 'flawed', 'creative', 'decisions', 'trio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'Robbins', 'Nixey', 'made', 'relating', 'approach', 'film', 'had', 'stayed', 'approach', 'original', 'TV', 'movie', 'making', 'adult', 'focus', 'film', 'putting', 'main', 'characters', 'peril', 'more', 'often', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'MIGHT', 'have', 'lived', 'up', 'potential', 'film', 'handsome', 'looking', 'atmospheric', 'thriller', 'victory', 'style', 'content.If', 'must', 'see', 'rent', 'first', 'make', 'sure', 'will', 'appeal']",N/A
1503666,A24J6PQ0FN55A6,B005TK22CU,WestGrl,"[1, 3]","I've seen a lot of the negative reviews but I personally liked this movie. Based on a father who recently gets custody of his depressed little girl and they move into an old home they are renovating with his girlfriend. From the get go you have issues, the relationship between daughter & her father's new girlfriend and the mental status of the little girl. When a room that was long sealed off is discovered, things go bad. Is the little girl crazy or is there really something evil lurking in the dark? This is a suspense thriller, not a horror movie. Most of the thrill is waiting to see what will happen next. The actress that plays the child in the movie is very believable, you can feel her terror & that just adds to the suspense. The source of the terror in the dark, in my opinion, is very much like the type of thing you would expect from del Toro. This movie may not be as amazing as Pan's Labyrinth but it's a quality suspense movie. I definitely wouldn't allow children to watch this. This is the kind of movie that would keep them up all night with the lights on. I liked the ending, not exactly what I was expecting which is good and a tiny little twist at the end if you pay close attention.",4,Decent suspense thriller,1326585600,"01 15, 2012",2012,1208,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'negative', 'reviews', 'personally', 'liked', 'movie', 'Based', 'father', 'who', 'recently', 'custody', 'depressed', 'little', 'girl', 'move', 'old', 'home', 'are', 'renovating', 'girlfriend', 'get', 'go', 'have', 'issues', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'father', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'mental', 'status', 'little', 'girl', 'When', 'room', 'was', 'long', 'sealed', 'off', 'discovered', 'things', 'go', 'bad', 'little', 'girl', 'crazy', 'really', 'something', 'evil', 'lurking', 'dark', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'Most', 'thrill', 'waiting', 'see', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'actress', 'child', 'movie', 'very', 'believable', 'can', 'feel', 'terror', 'just', 'suspense', 'source', 'terror', 'dark', 'opinion', 'very', 'much', 'type', 'thing', 'would', 'expect', 'del', 'Toro', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'amazing', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'quality', 'suspense', 'movie', 'definitely', 'would', ""n't"", 'allow', 'children', 'watch', 'kind', 'movie', 'would', 'keep', 'up', 'night', 'lights', 'liked', 'ending', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'good', 'tiny', 'little', 'twist', 'end', 'pay', 'close', 'attention']",N/A
