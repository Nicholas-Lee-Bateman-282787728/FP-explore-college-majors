I got distracted easily and thought a lot of the characters were creeps. But when you find out the amazing twist and experience the phenominal ending that is both powerful and extremely moving, you will most likely be tempted to start from the beginning and watch it all over again. I did, and I was careful to pay attention to every single second of it, and it's quite frankly ten times better the 2nd time round! There's so much going on in this movie that it's hard to believe all the negative reviews - perhaps they too were snoozing through the first half and forgot to wake up for the second half, and lied and said they saw it all and thought it was garbage? Less likely things have happened.Basically the twist in this movie is so outrageous that it changes literally everything you see throughout.Maybe you have to be a fan of these supernatural, caring films. Maybe they shouldn't have advertised it as a thriller because in the end it's anything but.This is a touching film that I recommend more for women than men. For anybody who has lost a loved one, this movie is for you. And oddly enough, this has made me less nervous about flying on a plane next week.Ignore the reviewers - you come across them all the time and know they are pretentious!

1225679,A16ZKEWQ6DLO45,B001P3SA9E,amerk,"[3, 5]","Okay, the acting and atmosphere was good and there were moments of tension, but that's about the extent of the pro's. The problem with this movie is it did not know what it wanted to be, where it wanted to go, or what story it wanted to tell. The beginning with the plane crash on the beach, the assumed survivors wandering around, and the bits they remember all seemed like something out of Lost. Then comes the fact that they all remember an explosion outside of their window, when the airline company would have you believe it was due to pilot error. Mysterious strangers all start showing up, and the movie begins to take on a Flight Plan feel. Suddenly people begin to disappear, and one would think you were watching Forgotten. But then comes the ""shocking"" end, which really isn't all that shocking, and you are thrown into a Sixth Sense clone. With Sixth Sense all the pieces in the movie added up. But with this one it does not. Questions are left unanswered. For example:1. Why were these few ""survivors"" chosen to wander around? Were they the only ones that realized they had not survived the crash? That almost makes sense, except for one of the supporting characters who made peace with herself during the crash and was willing to accept death. Except she must not have accepted death, because she was one of the people that had to find that special somebody to be able to move on.2. Hathaway's character couldn't recognize her own aunt and teacher, both of which were special to her at some point when they were alive. Huh? If they were so special, shouldn't she have recognized them, or at the very least be haunted by their presence? Everybody else who saw that special somebody at least reacted the right way. Maybe they were scared and ran away at first, but at least they reacted and seemed to recognize them. Hathaway's character goes through the whole movie without ever knowing until the end.3. What really was the cause of the crash? The pilot reveals himself and says it was his error, when everybody else claims otherwise. When Hathaway's character begins to realize she was on the flight, we the audience see the fate of the plane's flight, which seems to prove that what everbody else was saying was true. The plane exploded as a result of maintenance issues. So does this mean the pilot is blaming himself for something he could not control? Is the airline somehow responsible? Will the truth ever be made public? Was there a point to this subplot, or was it just thrown in there without any real purpose?4. What about the pilot and the amnesia? The amnesia seemed to recognize the pilot, but then we don't find out if that is how he came to terms with his death, or did he just remember the pilot for some distant memory? The pilot blames himself and wanders off. Does that mean he did indeed cause the crash? What became of his character?5. And finally, why does Hathaway's character wake up in home while the others are wandering around the crash site? Why can't she understand she was on that flight?",2,Too Many Unanswered Questions,1254096000,"09 28, 2009",2009,3032,"['Okay', 'acting', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'good', 'were', 'moments', 'tension', 'extent', 'pro', 'problem', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'where', 'wanted', 'go', 'what', 'story', 'wanted', 'tell', 'beginning', 'plane', 'crash', 'beach', 'assumed', 'survivors', 'wandering', 'around', 'bits', 'remember', 'seemed', 'something', 'Lost', 'Then', 'fact', 'remember', 'explosion', 'window', 'when', 'airline', 'company', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'was', 'due', 'pilot', 'error', 'Mysterious', 'strangers', 'start', 'showing', 'up', 'movie', 'take', 'Flight', 'Plan', 'feel', 'Suddenly', 'people', 'begin', 'disappear', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'were', 'watching', 'Forgotten', 'then', 'shocking', 'end', 'really', ""n't"", 'shocking', 'are', 'thrown', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'clone', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'pieces', 'movie', 'added', 'up', 'one', 'not', 'Questions', 'are', 'left', 'unanswered', 'example:1', 'Why', 'were', 'few', 'survivors', 'chosen', 'wander', 'around', 'Were', 'only', 'ones', 'realized', 'had', 'not', 'survived', 'crash', 'almost', 'sense', 'one', 'supporting', 'characters', 'who', 'made', 'peace', 'crash', 'was', 'willing', 'accept', 'death', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'accepted', 'death', 'was', 'one', 'people', 'had', 'find', 'special', 'somebody', 'be', 'able', 'move', 'on.2', 'Hathaway', 'character', 'could', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'own', 'aunt', 'teacher', 'were', 'special', 'point', 'when', 'were', 'alive', 'Huh', 'were', 'so', 'special', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'recognized', 'very', 'least', 'be', 'haunted', 'presence', 'Everybody', 'else', 'who', 'saw', 'special', 'somebody', 'least', 'reacted', 'right', 'way', 'Maybe', 'were', 'scared', 'ran', 'away', 'first', 'least', 'reacted', 'seemed', 'recognize', 'Hathaway', 'character', 'whole', 'movie', 'ever', 'knowing', 'end.3', 'What', 'really', 'was', 'cause', 'crash', 'pilot', 'reveals', 'was', 'error', 'when', 'everybody', 'else', 'otherwise', 'When', 'Hathaway', 'character', 'realize', 'was', 'flight', 'audience', 'see', 'fate', 'plane', 'flight', 'prove', 'what', 'everbody', 'else', 'was', 'saying', 'was', 'true', 'plane', 'exploded', 'result', 'maintenance', 'issues', 'So', 'mean', 'pilot', 'blaming', 'something', 'could', 'not', 'control', 'airline', 'somehow', 'responsible', 'Will', 'truth', 'ever', 'be', 'made', 'public', 'Was', 'point', 'subplot', 'was', 'just', 'thrown', 'there', 'real', 'purpose', '4', 'What', 'pilot', 'amnesia', 'amnesia', 'seemed', 'recognize', 'pilot', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'how', 'came', 'terms', 'death', 'did', 'just', 'remember', 'pilot', 'distant', 'memory', 'pilot', 'wanders', 'off', 'mean', 'did', 'indeed', 'cause', 'crash', 'What', 'became', 'character', '5', 'finally', 'why', 'Hathaway', 'character', 'wake', 'up', 'home', 'others', 'are', 'wandering', 'crash', 'site', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'was', 'flight']",N/A

She's a therapist trying to help the survivors of a plane accident cope with their daily stress, and she becomes really close with one of the patients.The second thing you need to know- everything taking place for the first 80% of film leads to an ending that's intended to shock the viewers.  It fails though, because for one thing it's poorly and predictably executed, and second of all, the weak writing you experience throughout the movie makes the conclusion incredibly underwhelming.A missed opportunity for a thriller pretty much sums up Passengers.  Movie writers need to understand that in order for a thriller to work, you can't revolve ALL the events around one unexpected twist at the end (which, in my opinion at least, wasn't that unexpected anyway).

A psychologist, Anne is tasked with helping the few survivors cope with their trauma. In the process, she becomes romantically involved with one of her patients (but he's quick to remind both Anne and the viewer that he's nobody's patient!), and she gradually begins to realize that nothing is as it seems.Hathaway and Patrick Wilson deliver solid performances as the leads, and David Morse is convincing in his supporting role. Holly Hunter makes an appearance as Hathaway's endearing neighbor, but I thought she actually came off as being quite creepy, which was surely not the director's intent. Perhaps I was just on edge.I'm a sucker for films like Passengers that allow the viewer to attempt to sort out what is going on before all is revealed. My issue with this film (and many others like it) is that the viewer is never given a fighting chance to figure out the twist. If I were to view a mind-bender like Passengers twice, I should be able to notice subtleties the second time around that allude to the conclusion of the film. There is nothing of the sort here. In fact, a lot of what I saw on-screen contradicted the end of the movie! In the interest of avoiding spoilers I won't go into detail, but I felt somewhat ripped-off when the credits began rolling by.Even so, Passengers is an entertaining film that merits watching.

1225689,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B001P3SA9E,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","This film was available on ""free"" TV, so I recorded it and watched it today.  It got a very low rating from both critics and viewers, so I wasn't expecting much.  But as someone that I know always says, ""Life comes down to expectations management.""  If you expect a lot and something doesn't deliver, it's disappointing.  For the converse, if you expect little and something's pretty good, it's a nice surprise.  ""Passengers"" certainly falls into that latter category for me and came off as a ""nice surprise.""There are definitely some X-Files-like connections here.  This was filmed in Vancouver, just like the X-Files, at least until the last season or two.  Note ""The Smoking Man"" in this film; he was the mean guy in the X-Files.  And the female lead -- Anne Hathaway -- plays a doctor, while the female lead in the X-Files -- Gillian Anderson -- played a doctor as well.  Well, Ms. Anderson played a surgeon or medical doctor, while Ms. Hathaway plays a psychiatrist.  You could say that the former profession heals people while the latter hurts them, but I digress.  (As an aside, I actually thought about Cory Monteith a bit here while watching, since he just recently died in a Vancouver hotel.)And like the X-Files, you really don't know what's going on through at least the first couple of acts, or at least you shouldn't, unless you're psychic, similar to Ms. Hathaway's hypothesis of the male lead, Patrick Wilson.  He doesn't seem to know her but he seems to surprisingly know some personal things about her anyways, and even though she's a ""scientist,"" you can't blame her for believing that he might have ESP.Now, films like this are very difficult to review without giving away a giveaway.  So, if you haven't seen this film, skip to the next paragraph.  MINOR SPOILER ALERT:  there are some issues with this screenplay, or at least the director's interpretation of it.  There are some inconsistencies.  For example, Ms. Wilson seems confused about a dog at one point but then right afterwards explains the meaning of the dog to Ms. Hathaway.  Was he lying to withhold the truth from her, or was this a screenplay miss?  Also, notice on the plane how Mr. Wilson seems to move one seat over but doesn't seem to put on a safety belt.  Then there is an explosion.  I believe that he would have been sucked out of the plane at this point.  While this film is like the X-Files, it also has some similar patterns as ""The Sixth Sense"" (TSS), but TSS did a better job of unwinding at the end with keeping consistency throughout.  END MINOR SPOILER ALERT.But still, a minor tearjerker whose theme might be something that Mr. Wilson said about halfway:  ""Live for today because tomorrow may not come.""  Indeed.  And this film does a good job of creating sympathetic characters.  So, I'll give a recommendation for a film that, while it certainly had its issues, it also had some pretty strong points.",4,Not a Bad Ride,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,2905,"['film', 'was', 'available', 'free', 'TV', 'recorded', 'watched', 'today', 'got', 'very', 'low', 'rating', 'critics', 'viewers', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'someone', 'know', 'always', 'Life', 'down', 'expectations', 'management', 'expect', 'lot', 'something', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'disappointing', 'converse', 'expect', 'little', 'something', 'pretty', 'good', 'nice', 'surprise', 'Passengers', 'certainly', 'latter', 'category', 'came', 'off', 'nice', 'surprise', 'are', 'definitely', 'X-Files-like', 'connections', 'here', 'was', 'filmed', 'Vancouver', 'just', 'X-Files', 'least', 'last', 'season', 'two', 'Note', 'Smoking', 'Man', 'film', 'was', 'mean', 'guy', 'X-Files', 'female', 'lead', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'doctor', 'female', 'lead', 'X-Files', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'played', 'doctor', 'well', 'Well', 'Ms.', 'Anderson', 'played', 'surgeon', 'medical', 'doctor', 'Ms.', 'Hathaway', 'psychiatrist', 'could', 'say', 'former', 'profession', 'heals', 'people', 'latter', 'digress', 'aside', 'actually', 'thought', 'Cory', 'Monteith', 'bit', 'here', 'watching', 'just', 'recently', 'died', 'Vancouver', 'hotel', 'X-Files', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'going', 'least', 'first', 'couple', 'acts', 'least', 'should', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'psychic', 'similar', 'Ms.', 'Hathaway', 'hypothesis', 'male', 'lead', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'surprisingly', 'know', 'personal', 'things', 'anyways', 'even', 'scientist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'believing', 'might', 'have', 'ESP.Now', 'films', 'are', 'very', 'difficult', 'review', 'giving', 'away', 'giveaway', 'So', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'skip', 'next', 'paragraph', 'MINOR', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'are', 'issues', 'screenplay', 'least', 'director', 'interpretation', 'are', 'inconsistencies', 'example', 'Ms.', 'Wilson', 'confused', 'dog', 'one', 'point', 'then', 'right', 'afterwards', 'meaning', 'dog', 'Ms.', 'Hathaway', 'Was', 'lying', 'withhold', 'truth', 'was', 'screenplay', 'miss', 'Also', 'notice', 'plane', 'how', 'Mr.', 'Wilson', 'move', 'one', 'seat', ""n't"", 'seem', 'put', 'safety', 'belt', 'Then', 'explosion', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sucked', 'plane', 'point', 'film', 'X-Files', 'also', 'similar', 'patterns', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'TSS', 'TSS', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'unwinding', 'end', 'keeping', 'consistency', 'END', 'MINOR', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT.But', 'still', 'minor', 'tearjerker', 'theme', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'Mr.', 'Wilson', 'said', 'halfway', 'Live', 'today', 'tomorrow', 'may', 'not', 'come', 'Indeed', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'creating', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'So', ""'ll"", 'give', 'recommendation', 'film', 'certainly', 'had', 'issues', 'also', 'had', 'pretty', 'strong', 'points']",N/A

How could ghosts not notice after a while that living people are ignoring them altogether?Even within the convention of accepting the existence of ghosts, incoherences pile up:David Morse's character makes no sense: As he initially looks, is he a creepy part of the airline's conspiracy to coverup an explosion? Wait a minute! No. He is the -now dead- pilot of the plane. How come he did not realize that? How does he relate to other workers at the airport? The airline conspiracy doesn't go anywhere, anyway.Why only a few of the passengers kept walking around? (The other 100 or so seem to be dead for good).Apparently, loved ones come back to take dead people to heaven. Anne Hathaway's character, however, until the last moment does not recognize her auntie and confuses a teacher from her infancy with a senior psychologist. (By the way, the psychologist she portrays is most unprofessional, naive, incompetent).Why the other six passengers remember being on the plane but Hathaway,  until the end, does not? Why one of them does not remember who he was while the others do? Uhmm.Dead people interact normally with solid objects (telephones, cars, motorcycle, doors, briefcase, sailboat) but a train goes through Patrick Wilson as if he were gaseous.How being dead could explain that Hathaway's sister (who is very much alive) is never in her house?

The story centers around a psychotherapist (Clare, played by Anne Hathaway) who is summoned for the thankless task of trying to help the survivors of a plane crash cope with their trauma and depression.  From the get-go, something seems to be kahooey regarding the survivors.This film demonstrates Hathaway's range as an actress.  Clare is the antipode to the feisty character of Catwoman whom she portrays inThe Dark Knight.  Clare is demure, coy, ultra sensitive and diffident.  Hathaway delivers a fine performance, which is particularly significant in the present film as she is in basically 100% of the movie.

The group is strange, not so much for the crash but more for the lives they've lived leading up to the crash - or so Claire believes.  Claire is particularly drawn to Eric (Patrick Wilson) who seems somehow above the emotional trauma and indeed begins to 'court' Claire with requests for house calls, incidents that lead to a romance.  Gradually the survivors in Claire's therapy group disappear and Claire is made suspicious of the cause of the accident, a fact that disturbs the airline person Arkin (David Morse).  Eric's strange behavior as well as the appearance of the odd character Toni (Dianne Wiest) and the counsel from Claire's colleague Perry (Andre Braugher) begin to unravel a mystery that is finally made clear in the closing moments of the film.  To say more would be to spoil the ending.PASSENGERS is not a great movie but it is a fairly good and well-acted suspense/romance drama.  The cast is solid but the direction by Rodrigo Garc&iacute;a of the Swiss cheese script by Ronnie Christensen is shaky: the premise is good but the getting there is full of potholes and road kill.  Nevertheless it is a good little diversion of a film for a rainy night.  And the actors do their very best to make it better than it is.

Well, the psychiatrist played by Anne Hathaway kept going on and on about how could the one patient possibly know she had a sister? Come on. Almost everyone has a sister. That's the type of guess a ""psychic"" would make.Next, the patients started to disappear. I didn't really notice because most of them had not appeared in the movie for more than 2 minutes anyway. Most of the movie was focused not on the thriller aspect and the group  therapy but on Anne's relationship with one patient in particular. And inappropriate relationships between psychiatrists and patients have been totally overdone in movies. Anne Hathaway really wasn't believable as a psychiatrist, either. Granted, that may have been the fault of the role itself. She was a very young and immature character.The ending was a little surprising.

This was an excellent and moving film with a very strong performance from Anne Hathaway inparticular. Be careful what you read below - one reviewer gives away the whole plot (why people do this in reviews I'll never know...). The film does leave you wondering what is really going on and it is NOT predictable. People tend to say this AFTER they have seen a film, I notice! Anyway, if you like any of Anne Hathaway's work, you will like this - and if you don't, then try this one out - you may be pleasantly surprised. Anne Hathaway has perhaps fallen into the same trap as many other excellent actresses in that she is type-cast over and over in fairly 'blah' roles (eg in films such Ella Enchanted, Bride Wars or Devil Wears Prada), roles which do not allow her to display her acting talents to their fullest. Passengers fortunately, is a film that does let us see what Anne is capable of and hopefully she will do other films of a more serious nature in the future, as she can most certainly carry them.As an aside, Sandra Bullock comes to mind as someone who was (is?) in a similar postion to Anne. I have always felt that she has remarkable acting talent and it is only in recent years that I have really seen it coming out in her films, Premonition being a fine example (and the Lakehouse - though to a much lesser degree).addendum - having watched Passengers about 3 times now, I would most certainly bump it up to 5 stars and also recommend the extremely moving soundtrack. This film is of a much, much deeper nature than it may first appear and is one of those few films that I can say has 'touched' me inside.

The basic plot premise is that Claire Summers, (Anne Hathaway) a psychologist, tries to help half a dozen airplane crash survivors cope with post traumatic stress disorder. Now, personally, from the beginning, I knew exactly what was going to happen at the end, but hold still. The ending is a must.The middle portion of the film is full of medical interviews and sessions with various survivors of the crash who seem to all have different memories of the incident, different feelings and different reactions. This part is mostly filler with each patient strangely disappearing as the film progress. There are too many `gotcha' moments like phones ringing in the middle of the night, newspapers flapping at Claire's face in the wind, barking dogs that won't go away, people jumping off roofs in front of Claire that were just `goofs', a faked drowning, etc. There is tons of symbolism. There is even a fake conspiracy that fills time. Then there is also the obligatory love scene between Claire Summers and Eric (Patrick Wilson) as a creepy guy turned amorous. It's just a pack of things you've seen before.However, in the last 15 minutes of the film, you start to catch on with each character's life and it really turns out to be quite moving. You understand why each person was in the plot and what they were and what they turn into. The final moments are very touching as everything comes together and there is a good feeling of satisfaction.

1225722,AMUP8DYE7EAN2,B001P3SA9E,"mateo52 ""invisible man""","[1, 2]","Essentially, lasting impressions of this film will depend on the fulcrum of opinion regarding the acting ability of Anne Hathaway.  While she is supported by a bevy of veteran actors I consider talented (Dianne Wiest, Andre Braugher, David Morse) as well as a couple where I believe the jury is still out (Patrick Wilson and Clea DuVall) with the exception of Wilson, their contributions are mainly tangential and for the majority of the film, sketchily delineated. Hathaway is called upon to hold the viewers interest and unfortunately, I didn't feel she was up to the challenge. As a therapist somewhat reluctantly assigned to work as a grief counselor with a group of airline crash survivors, I found her unconvincing for a variety of reasons and notwithstanding the attempts to insert twists and turns in plot progression, the big dog's portion of the movie is wholly dependent  on her.One inherent constraint was the director's decision to obscure his vision  in several interwoven approaches. Parts are intended to be pure suspense, other segments have aspects of the mystery thriller; he reverts to what appears to be linear dramatic character study development and regrettably also is not averse to throwing a bit of superfluous romantic influence. In the end, the conflicting courses do not mesh successfully and for most of the movie it feels like the only reason to continue viewing is the illogical personal commitment to see it through to conclusion.Only in the last half-hour or so are all of the clues that one may have noticed early on amalgamated to bring the actual plot of the movie into focus.  Director Rodrigo Garcia makes a yeoman's effort to bind all of the anomalies, curiosities and sub-plots into a cohesive finish but he takes too long and meanders too far downstream in getting there for a film that ultimately many viewers may find derivative or suggestive of a few other, more widely successful films.One key aspect in that eventually comes across particularly flat is what turns out to selective memory loss for a few of the characters because it seems completely out of synch with other attributes they exhibit.  I wish I could give a more concise explanation but any more depth would be way too close to a spoiler in my opinion.In the final analysis (no pun intended) this is a decent effort but only remarkable for comparative purposes to other works.",3,In flight turbulence,1248393600,"07 24, 2009",2009,2386,"['Essentially', 'lasting', 'impressions', 'film', 'will', 'depend', 'fulcrum', 'opinion', 'regarding', 'acting', 'ability', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'supported', 'bevy', 'veteran', 'actors', 'consider', 'talented', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'David', 'Morse', 'as', 'well', 'couple', 'where', 'believe', 'jury', 'still', 'out', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Clea', 'DuVall', 'exception', 'Wilson', 'contributions', 'are', 'mainly', 'tangential', 'majority', 'film', 'sketchily', 'delineated', 'Hathaway', 'called', 'hold', 'viewers', 'interest', 'unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'up', 'challenge', 'therapist', 'somewhat', 'reluctantly', 'assigned', 'work', 'grief', 'counselor', 'group', 'airline', 'crash', 'survivors', 'found', 'unconvincing', 'variety', 'reasons', 'notwithstanding', 'attempts', 'insert', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'progression', 'big', 'dog', 'portion', 'movie', 'wholly', 'dependent', 'her.One', 'inherent', 'constraint', 'was', 'director', 'decision', 'obscure', 'vision', 'several', 'interwoven', 'approaches', 'Parts', 'are', 'intended', 'be', 'pure', 'suspense', 'other', 'segments', 'have', 'aspects', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'what', 'be', 'linear', 'dramatic', 'character', 'study', 'development', 'regrettably', 'also', 'not', 'averse', 'throwing', 'bit', 'superfluous', 'romantic', 'influence', 'end', 'conflicting', 'courses', 'do', 'not', 'mesh', 'successfully', 'most', 'movie', 'only', 'reason', 'continue', 'viewing', 'illogical', 'personal', 'commitment', 'see', 'conclusion.Only', 'last', 'half-hour', 'so', 'are', 'clues', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'noticed', 'early', 'amalgamated', 'bring', 'actual', 'plot', 'movie', 'focus', 'Director', 'Rodrigo', 'Garcia', 'yeoman', 'effort', 'bind', 'anomalies', 'curiosities', 'sub-plots', 'cohesive', 'finish', 'too', 'long', 'meanders', 'too', 'far', 'downstream', 'getting', 'there', 'film', 'ultimately', 'many', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'derivative', 'suggestive', 'few', 'other', 'more', 'widely', 'successful', 'films.One', 'key', 'aspect', 'eventually', 'particularly', 'flat', 'what', 'out', 'selective', 'memory', 'loss', 'few', 'characters', 'completely', 'synch', 'other', 'attributes', 'exhibit', 'wish', 'could', 'give', 'more', 'concise', 'explanation', 'more', 'depth', 'would', 'be', 'way', 'too', 'close', 'spoiler', 'opinion.In', 'final', 'analysis', 'pun', 'intended', 'decent', 'effort', 'only', 'remarkable', 'comparative', 'purposes', 'other', 'works']",N/A

Sherwin,"[12, 12]","Passengers may not be the most memorable or original film I've ever seen; but it's actually rather well done and I liked the convincing acting of both Anne Hathaway and Patrick Wilson in their roles as the main characters. The cinematography and the choreography work wonders for the film; and the casting was very well done. The action flows along at a good pace although the script and the footage could have been edited down a few minutes to make the action tighter and the film a better one.When the film starts, we meet a young psychologist named Claire (Anne Hathaway) who takes on the responsibility for running group therapy for the handful of survivors of a horrific plane crash. Her boss, Perry (Andre Braugher) believes it would be a good assignment for Claire to get her ""out of (her) comfort zone."" Claire must help them talk about their grief and pain to get over their post traumatic stress and ""find out the truth.""Once the group starts, Claire meets the survivors and the group includes Norman (Don Thompson), Shannon (Clea DuVall) and Dean (Ryan Robbins). However, members of the group start to miss therapy sessions; and Claire slowly begins to believe that they are missing persons and not merely dropping out of therapy. Claire and other people in the group are also uncomfortable when they notice a stranger staring in from the outside at the group; and Claire's relationship with the airline representative Arkin (David Morse) is not exactly going well as he is clearly holding things back from her, possibly to avoid the airline being held liable for the accident.In addition, one more survivor, Eric (Patrick Wilson), gives Claire a surprise when he comes off as rather happy and upbeat about life despite the terrible crash he just experienced. As the rest of the action occurs, Claire gradually finds herself falling for Eric and this muddles things for her both professionally and personally. She also has a well-meaning but rather nosy neighbor, Toni (Dianne Wiest).Of course the plot can go in several different directions but suffice to say I never anticipated the way the film ended. Talk about a surprise! It's one of the best things about the film.The DVD comes with a few deleted scenes and there's an optional running commentary with director Rodrigo Garcia and Patrick Wilson. We also get the featurettes entitled ""Analysis of the Plane Crash"" and ""The Manifest & Making of Passengers.""I recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; and people who enjoy thriller dramas with mystery and even some romance will enjoy this film.",4,a good film with an ending that will shock you,1267920000,"03 7, 2010",2010,2568,"['Passengers', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'memorable', 'original', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'actually', 'rather', 'well', 'done', 'liked', 'convincing', 'acting', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'roles', 'main', 'characters', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'work', 'wonders', 'film', 'casting', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'action', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'script', 'footage', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'down', 'few', 'minutes', 'make', 'action', 'tighter', 'film', 'better', 'film', 'meet', 'young', 'psychologist', 'named', 'Claire', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'who', 'responsibility', 'running', 'group', 'therapy', 'handful', 'survivors', 'horrific', 'plane', 'crash', 'boss', 'Perry', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'assignment', 'Claire', 'get', 'comfort', 'zone', 'Claire', 'must', 'help', 'talk', 'grief', 'pain', 'get', 'over', 'post', 'traumatic', 'stress', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'group', 'Claire', 'survivors', 'group', 'Norman', 'Don', 'Thompson', 'Shannon', 'Clea', 'DuVall', 'Dean', 'Ryan', 'Robbins', 'However', 'members', 'group', 'start', 'miss', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'Claire', 'slowly', 'believe', 'are', 'missing', 'persons', 'not', 'merely', 'dropping', 'therapy', 'Claire', 'other', 'people', 'group', 'are', 'also', 'uncomfortable', 'when', 'notice', 'stranger', 'staring', 'outside', 'group', 'Claire', 'relationship', 'airline', 'representative', 'Arkin', 'David', 'Morse', 'not', 'exactly', 'going', 'well', 'clearly', 'holding', 'things', 'back', 'possibly', 'avoid', 'airline', 'being', 'held', 'liable', 'accident.In', 'addition', 'one', 'more', 'survivor', 'Eric', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Claire', 'surprise', 'when', 'off', 'rather', 'happy', 'upbeat', 'life', 'terrible', 'crash', 'just', 'experienced', 'rest', 'action', 'Claire', 'gradually', 'falling', 'Eric', 'things', 'professionally', 'personally', 'also', 'well-meaning', 'rather', 'nosy', 'neighbor', 'Toni', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', '.Of', 'course', 'plot', 'can', 'go', 'several', 'different', 'directions', 'suffice', 'say', 'never', 'anticipated', 'way', 'film', 'ended', 'Talk', 'surprise', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'optional', 'running', 'commentary', 'director', 'Rodrigo', 'Garcia', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'also', 'get', 'featurettes', 'entitled', 'Analysis', 'Plane', 'Crash', 'Manifest', 'Making', 'Passengers', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'actors', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'thriller', 'dramas', 'mystery', 'even', 'romance', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film']",N/A

Instead, this was a case of too little ""horror,"" too late.Indeed, not so much horror as squishy, New Age mush.If you like spiritual pseudo-horror like THE FORGOTTEN or DRAGONFLY, you might enjoy PASSENGERS, since it's the same old, same old (with borrowings from THE SIXTH SENSE, THE OTHERS, GHOST, JACOB'S LADDER, and the original TWILIGHT ZONE TV series).This is not really a spoiler, since the marketing (e.g. DVD box blurbs) kinda give away the premise...Passengers survive a plane crash, but then begin vanishing. Like that TWILIGHT ZONE episode about astronauts who survive a mishap in space, but when they return to Earth, they begin vanishing...  Something they had encountered ""up there"" didn't mean for them to return, and is correcting its mistake.PASSENGERS had scary potential.  Why are surviving passengers vanishing? What's being ""corrected""?  A rip in space/time?  Some Supernatural Order (e.g., FINAL DESTINATION)?No, instead PASSENGERS borrows the more familiar explanation, found in THE SIXTH SENSE, JACOB'S LADDER, GHOST, and THE OTHERS.  If you know those ""twist"" endings, you'll guess early on what PASSENGERS is about.PASSENGERS is slow and boring.  We're nearly TWO THIRDS into the film before it gets ominous.

1225737,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001P3SA9E,Tsuyoshi,"[8, 14]","""Passengers"" would have been a straight-to-DVD film had it not been for the name of Anna Hatherway (""Rachel Getting Married"") I am not saying that ""Passengers"" (of which story reminds me of Peter Weir's 1993 film ""Fearless"") is a horrible film. Actually its final chapter impressed me, but despite that and film's nice cinematography, the process to the resolution needs improvement.Anna Hatherway is Claire Summers, a therapist who is assigned to counsel the five survivors of a major airline crash. Claire is intrigued by one survivor Eric (Patrick Wilson), whose personality it is obvious has drastically changed after the devastating event. While Claire is attracted to nice and handsome Eric, perhaps more than she should be, Eric experiences strange sensations.""Passengers"" has an ambitious premise - which I am not allowed to reveal it all - but still I can say Rodrigo Garc&iacute;a as a director is trying to make a moving character-driven drama and intriguing thriller as the same time. Some of the survivors say there was an explosion before the crash, but the airline represented by David Morse's character strongly denies that. Claire smells a cover up, but she is not perfectly sure who is right.One major problem is the character Anne Hatherway plays, a grief counselor whose behaviors are too immature and unprofessional. Rodrigo Garc&iacute;a, probably better known for his critically acclaimed film ""Nine Lives,"" did create more credible characters in the past, but here Hatherway's therapist is simply unbelievable, repeatedly committing mistakes that no professional therapist would do. ""Passengers"" is less a thriller than a drama, but to be a decent drama a film need a better protagonist you can relate to.As to the film's thriller part, there is nothing intriguing about what the film shows or suggests. It gives us hints, certainly - a barking dog, a stranger standing in the street and so on - but these are thrown in at random, not strong enough to make us keep guessing.Of course everything will be explained in the film's wrap-up - things about young Claire and her sister who is away from the town; about Dianne Wiest's character, always gentle and smiling; or about Andre Braugher's Perry, Claire's ""mentor."" As I said, the film's conclusion is powerful and emotional.
