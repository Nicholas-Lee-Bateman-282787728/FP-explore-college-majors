Why? Well, it's a Japanese tokusatsu(special effects) TV series that doesn't take itself too seriously yet is serious enough that, even the hardcore Kaiju fan, would love it. The series, itself, aired from April 4, 1973, to March 27, 1974, with a total of 39 episodes. The series was produced by the same team that brought you Ultraman and Iron King. It's story was later retold in the anime of Red Baron and the sequel Super Robot Mach Baron. It is set in the early 21st century. The Iron Alliance begins stealing giant robots built from all over the world as well as kidnapping their creators. Kurenai Kenichiro who creates Red Baron turns over his robot to his brother Ken. Ken is a member of SSI (Secret Science Investigation). Ken uses Red Baron to help them put a stop to the Iron Alliance from taking over the world. That's pretty much what the show is about.The series is completely in Japanese with subtitles. While it is fine with me, it will probably upset some of you. Really, you shouldn't let that stop you from watching such an awesome show. It'll give you a better understanding of Japanese TV shows such as this.",5,Super Robot Red Baron: The Complete Series.....,1275091200,"05 29, 2010",2010,1291,"['had', 'pick', 'Kaiju', 'Daikaiju', 'Giant', 'Monster', 'Japanese', 'TV', 'Show', 'favorite', 'think', 'Super', 'Robot', 'Red', 'Baron', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'pick', 'Why', 'Well', 'Japanese', 'tokusatsu', 'special', 'effects', 'TV', 'series', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'yet', 'serious', 'enough', 'even', 'hardcore', 'Kaiju', 'fan', 'would', 'love', 'series', 'aired', 'April', '4', '1973', 'March', '27', '1974', 'total', '39', 'episodes', 'series', 'was', 'produced', 'same', 'team', 'brought', 'Ultraman', 'Iron', 'King', 'story', 'was', 'later', 'retold', 'anime', 'Red', 'Baron', 'sequel', 'Super', 'Robot', 'Mach', 'Baron', 'set', 'early', '21st', 'century', 'Iron', 'Alliance', 'stealing', 'giant', 'robots', 'built', 'world', 'as', 'well', 'kidnapping', 'creators', 'Kurenai', 'Kenichiro', 'who', 'Red', 'Baron', 'over', 'robot', 'brother', 'Ken', 'Ken', 'member', 'SSI', 'Secret', 'Science', 'Investigation', 'Ken', 'Red', 'Baron', 'help', 'put', 'stop', 'Iron', 'Alliance', 'taking', 'over', 'world', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'show', 'about.The', 'series', 'completely', 'Japanese', 'subtitles', 'fine', 'will', 'probably', 'upset', 'Really', 'should', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'watching', 'such', 'awesome', 'show', ""'ll"", 'give', 'better', 'understanding', 'Japanese', 'TV', 'shows', 'such']",The Super Robot Red Baron - The Complete Series

But if your a fan of the early Japanese ""Secial Effects"" shows that really started with Ultraman then this value-priced pack is a great buy.  Packing is well done and each of the 4 disks has it's own sleeve in the box.  But realise that this series was made on what looked like Ultraman's lunch budget, and that is where the fun really begins.  Supposedly made by people ""responsable for Ultraman & Iron King (another gem)"" it has the same basic ""evil monster of the week"" set-up, only this time with some of the silliest robots ever to be seen, which includes the title robot - actually a mecha with a pilot, and others including one that plays a mean game of golf.The transfer cold have been better, but in a way it ads to the feeling of just how old this series is.  While I couldn't find anything that said when Red Baron was produced, my guess from the hair, what they wore, and some of their vehicles, my guess puts it at the early to mid '70s so being just a bit grainy adds to it's charm to me.  I also strongly recommend that if you buy Red Baron then just save the time and get ""Iron King"" at the same time - it's sort of like RB's big brother from the same source and many of the same ""qualities"".  Between the two you will not only have some great entertainment but also a great value.Now if only Johny Sako was in the same price range...",4,Unintentionally hilarious....,1308700800,"06 22, 2011",2011,1402,"['Should', 'be', 'looking', 'film', 'art-', ""n't"", 'fan', 'early', 'Japanese', 'Secial', 'Effects', 'really', 'started', 'Ultraman', 'then', 'value-priced', 'pack', 'great', 'buy', 'Packing', 'well', 'done', '4', 'disks', 'own', 'sleeve', 'box', 'realise', 'series', 'was', 'made', 'what', 'looked', 'Ultraman', 'lunch', 'budget', 'where', 'fun', 'really', 'Supposedly', 'made', 'people', 'responsable', 'Ultraman', 'Iron', 'King', 'gem', 'same', 'basic', 'evil', 'monster', 'week', 'set-up', 'only', 'time', 'silliest', 'robots', 'ever', 'be', 'seen', 'title', 'robot', 'actually', 'mecha', 'pilot', 'others', 'including', 'one', 'mean', 'game', 'golf.The', 'transfer', 'cold', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'way', 'ads', 'feeling', 'just', 'how', 'old', 'series', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'said', 'when', 'Red', 'Baron', 'was', 'produced', 'guess', 'hair', 'what', 'wore', 'vehicles', 'guess', 'early', 'mid', ""'70s"", 'so', 'being', 'just', 'bit', 'grainy', 'charm', 'also', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'buy', 'Red', 'Baron', 'then', 'just', 'save', 'time', 'get', 'Iron', 'King', 'same', 'time', 'sort', 'RB', 'big', 'brother', 'same', 'source', 'many', 'same', 'qualities', 'two', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'great', 'entertainment', 'also', 'great', 'value.Now', 'only', 'Johny', 'Sako', 'was', 'same', 'price', 'range']",The Super Robot Red Baron - The Complete Series

It had a follow up series Super Robot Mach Baron which ran for 26 episodes. Basically an evil organization steals all the robots from a convention for giant robots and try to use them to take over the world. Some humor and fun fight scenes which remind you of the old Godzilla movies. I would recommend seeing this. It is only in Japanese with English Subtitles.

For me what makes this Super Red Baron show so fun to watch are all the giant robots Red Baron fights. Some of which look like the Robots right out of the Gigantor cartoon brought to life. Some reviewers have made it a point to really gripe about an out-of-sync issue. Well since I don't speak Japanese I can't tell. I see their mouths move. I hear their voice. I see words on the screen. They stop talking. The words disappear. That looks pretty synced up to me. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the corny 70s style sitcom background music that pops up from time to time. But over all if you like seeing giant robots fight then you'll probably love this. In fact the more I watch this the more I hate the 2005 Tetsujin 28 Go movie for using CGI instead of suit actors.",5,THE CLOSEST THING TO A LIVE ACTION GIGANTOR SERIES WE'LL EVER SEE,1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2013,931,"['Yes', 'once', 'was', 'short', 'lived', 'live', 'action', 'Tetsujin', '28', 'Go/', 'Gigantor', 'series', 'way', 'back', '1960', 'finding', 'footage', 'photos', 'next', 'impossible', 'what', 'Super', 'Red', 'Baron', 'show', 'so', 'fun', 'watch', 'are', 'giant', 'robots', 'Red', 'Baron', 'fights', 'look', 'Robots', 'right', 'Gigantor', 'cartoon', 'brought', 'life', 'reviewers', 'have', 'made', 'point', 'really', 'gripe', 'out-of-sync', 'issue', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Japanese', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'see', 'mouths', 'move', 'hear', 'voice', 'see', 'words', 'screen', 'stop', 'talking', 'words', 'disappear', 'pretty', 'synced', 'up', 'only', 'thing', ""'m"", 'not', 'crazy', 'corny', '70s', 'style', 'sitcom', 'background', 'music', 'time', 'time', 'like', 'seeing', 'giant', 'robots', 'fight', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', 'fact', 'more', 'watch', 'more', 'hate', '2005', 'Tetsujin', '28', 'Go', 'movie', 'using', 'CGI', 'instead', 'suit', 'actors']",The Super Robot Red Baron - The Complete Series

RED BARON is a well-made and quite action-packed series that plays like a melding of ULTRAMAN and ASTRO BOY.

There is even a cameo appearance by none other than Snoopy! BCI/Eclipse is doing a great service to tokusatsu fans by making shows such as RED BARON available in the US.

1126041,A2F1UAZKIM1HRX,B0010T3UO8,"Warren ""Warren""","[15, 15]","Super Robot Red Baron is an immensely entertaining item of televisual sci-fi culture from 1970s Japan. A group of young people work for a super-science organization that battles a crime syndicate / evil empire from space. Central to every episode is a climactic battle between the good-guy giant robot, Red Baron, and the equally enormous bad-guy robot-of-the-week. They fight it out, Godzilla-style, in an H-O scale landscape complete with model cities, refineries, factories, and little toy tanks that actually shoot. Generally speaking, the production values compare well to some shows from the same era, for example, Doctor Who of the 70s. There is a certain amount of the quirky-seeming (to western eyes) comic relief that is often present in Japanese productions. And while character development is limited, it is not altogether absent, and there are also moments of genuine drama and pathos. Most importantly, there are occasional flashes of visual brilliance. For example, in the series finale there are scenes of a surreal virtual reality beach and a clockwork throne room that would be at home in an episode of The Prisoner or in one of Andrei Tarkovsky's science fiction films.",4,Vintage 70s pop culture from Japan,1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,1188,"['Super', 'Robot', 'Red', 'Baron', 'immensely', 'entertaining', 'item', 'televisual', 'sci-fi', 'culture', '1970s', 'Japan', 'A', 'group', 'young', 'people', 'work', 'super-science', 'organization', 'crime', 'syndicate', '/', 'evil', 'empire', 'space', 'Central', 'episode', 'climactic', 'battle', 'good-guy', 'giant', 'robot', 'Red', 'Baron', 'equally', 'enormous', 'bad-guy', 'robot-of-the-week', 'fight', 'out', 'Godzilla-style', 'H-O', 'scale', 'landscape', 'complete', 'model', 'cities', 'refineries', 'factories', 'little', 'toy', 'tanks', 'actually', 'shoot', 'Generally', 'speaking', 'production', 'values', 'compare', 'well', 'shows', 'same', 'era', 'example', 'Doctor', 'Who', '70s', 'certain', 'amount', 'quirky-seeming', 'western', 'eyes', 'comic', 'relief', 'often', 'present', 'Japanese', 'productions', 'character', 'development', 'limited', 'not', 'altogether', 'absent', 'are', 'also', 'moments', 'genuine', 'drama', 'pathos', 'Most', 'importantly', 'are', 'occasional', 'flashes', 'visual', 'brilliance', 'example', 'series', 'finale', 'are', 'scenes', 'surreal', 'virtual', 'reality', 'beach', 'clockwork', 'throne', 'room', 'would', 'be', 'home', 'episode', 'Prisoner', 'one', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'science', 'fiction', 'films']",The Super Robot Red Baron - The Complete Series
