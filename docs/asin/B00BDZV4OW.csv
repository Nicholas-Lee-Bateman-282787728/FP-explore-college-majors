The quality of the DVD'S is a very clear and nice transfer, so there aren't any problems there.The show itself, is a tough, gritty, realistic, and true-to-life depiction of how the police in those days of the 50's, cracked cases and tracked down criminals.  Crawford is top-notch as Chief Dan Mathews, who's rapid-fire dialogue and sharp intellect leads his division of the Highway Patrol. The acting, sets, location shots,action, stories, and photography are all first-rate for those days.  You'll love this, if you love police dramas. One of the stories was written by Gene Roddenberry!

Since the show was hemmed in by the fact each show had to involve the Highway Patrol they did a real good job varying the stories as much as possible.Broderick Crawford was a pretty good choice for the head honcho of a police dept. He set the right tone for the entire series.It was also very interesting to see the old cars and dress of the 1950's.I would rate this a very solid 3.5 to 4.0 out of 5 stars.

For some reason, Amazon saw fit to pull this dvd set, but didn't feel it necessary to say exactly what the problem was. I found NO problem with the set I received. As far the series itself - the only thing I can say is that this is/was one of the best tv series EVER. I thoroughly enjoyed watching these ""old"" episodes, revisiting the way things used to be. Just think, no sex, no cursing, just fast moving action with almost always great acting. Unfortunatley, they don't make them like this anymore.

Besides being a great and entertaining show, this series is like a historical time capsule for California. Many of the scenes were done on location in various parts of California. They used parts of unfinished highway, back roads, parks, all of which look very different today.Broderick Crawford was a fine actor who made the show convincing and compelling. He was rough on the bad guys, gentle with the children and got frustrated with citizens who got in the way of his work.Television was still fairly new when this show was on and it is interesting to see how the cast members were used. Some actors would play a 'good guy' in one episode and a 'villain' in another episode.
