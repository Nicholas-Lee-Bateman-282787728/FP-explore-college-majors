590844,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JKTE,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 5]","Let me state the obvious.  Charlotte Rampling is phenomenal in anything that she does.With that out of the way, I can go so far as to say that Cate Blanchett ranks well into the second place position with her strong body of work and amazing ability to evoke the strongest of emotions.  It doesn't matter if you are watching her in the phenomenal ""Elizabeth"" or the slightly obtuse film ""The Shipping News"" or even the hysterical Armstrong pic, ""Life Aquatic"", she is worth every moment of screen minute.  Blanchett ranks up there with my philosophy of Gene Hackman.  The man may not make the greatest of films, but he is always worth watching.  The same can be said for Cate.  She may not make the greatest film choices possible, but she does keep you eye focused on the screen.  This was my thought as I watched the disappointing biopic entitled, ""Charlotte Gray"".  I was actually looking forward to this film with such amazing actors taking the helm as Blanchett, the amazing Michael Gambon, and the quieted Billy Crudup, but even with such power players behind the words, one could not cover up the mush-mouthed film that director Gillian Armstrong attempted to create.I don't mean to be harsh, but there were some serious flaws in this film that even director Armstrong addresses in the audio commentary.  The first which was obvious as the film began its downward stroll, was the issue of language.  This was an Australian film, beginning in Scotland, going to England, and ending up in France.  So, what language would be best to be used?  Anderson took the southern approach and decided to not  use the native tongue, and instead throw at us a very weak French accent for all occasions.  Gambon, obviously, chose not to do any of these options and went with his own accent.  Crudup seemed the least apt to handle this non-American accent, while Blanchett ... well ... she did what she could, constantly fluctuating between her Scottish accent and that of something that could only be called ""French"".  It was not a strong way to lure the historical cinema guy into the picture.  While I realize that it would have been tough to ""sell"" this as a foreign language film, I do believe that it would have pulled me deeper into the story and into the trenches of what these women had to do for their country.  Instead, it just felt cheap and extremely Hollywood-""ized"", though it wasn't.The story followed suite.  It was supposed to be this grandiose story of a woman's plight for her country.  It was supposed to be this story of independence and self-discovery, but alas, it transformed into this mushy story about love with no cohesiveness.  We begin this adventure with a woman who is afraid to smoke around others, afraid to drink in public, and suddenly falls head over feet with a man whom she is willing to do anything for.  While Armstrong did address the quick courtship in this film, I just felt like we needed more explanation.  We needed to see her independence further before making the rash jump into bed, so to speak.  Then, quickly, we are placed into training, lies, and finally dropped over France.  All before we can really see who this woman really is.  I wanted, needed, desperately desired, to know who Charlotte Gray was before getting deep behind enemy lines.  I don't mind a two hour film, but two hours in France not quite understanding our main character is not a way for a film to just be thrown in our faces.  Who was Charlotte?  Who was Gambon?  Who was Crudup?  I needed this, but alas, Armstrong was too busy focusing on love, random acts of children, and a family torn between two generations.  Haven't we heard this all before?So, we have this weak message, sent by mediocre voices, through a war that gets more and more random as the minutes progress.  Can anyone answer to me what the true mission was of Gray during her tour?  Why would she fight so much with so less reward near the end?  Did those we viewed through the film just disappear by the end?  Too many questions for what should have been just a straight forward film.  I wanted concise direction and a focus towards our main character, Gray, but instead we were handed a hodgepodge of stories that never quite connected.  Armstrong attempts to answer those nay-saying critics through the audio commentary with feeble responses and dramatic ""I was the director"" cards.  It becomes difficult for foreign directors to try to capture the feel and truthfulness of another country's hero.  Armstrong failed in this case.  She even second-guessed a couple of her scenes in the final film, a sure-fire sign that it wasn't the film that you wanted to finish with.  The only director that can successfully critic his  own films, and that is Uwe Boll, and that goes without saying.I can't say that I was happy with the overall finale of this film.  The glue wasn't very tight and instead of honesty, Armstrong seemed to focus on the randomness of love, circumstance, and scenery.  I didn't think this was a solid film at all, and have to side with the critics that seemed to think that this was just another biographical fluff film.  Blanchett acted her heart out (for no apparent reason), and Scotland was beautiful, but I cannot credit anything else with this film.  If you are looking for history, I would find something else.  If you are looking for a title that you would find in the ""romance"" section of your local bookstore, then ""Charlotte Gray"" is the film for you.Grade: ** out of ***** (one for Scotland, one for

This came from an international news report shown earlier today. The report was on the death of Nancy Wake a few days ago in an English nursing home. Nancy Wake came from Australia about the time Germany took over France. She worked in the French underground rescuing downed pilots and others the Germans were after. After some training in England she returned to France and became THE most highly decorated of all in the French underground for her exploits against the occupiers, especially after the arrest, torture and execution of her husband. She was one of the most sought after of all the underground operatives by German military, but was never arrested, probably because they were looking for a man, not expecting that a women was that capable.The news report included a segment of an interview with her a few years ago (she appeared to be in her eighties at the time) in which her closing comment on her war service was that in her opinion ""the only good German was a dead was a dead one. The deader the better. And that is all I will say about that.""The news report specifically mentioned the movie ""Charlotte Grey"" being based on events in Nancy Wake's life.",1,About Charlotte Grey,1313107200,"08 12, 2011",2011,1484,"['8/12/11This', 'not', 'actually', 'review', 'movie', 'Charlotte', 'Grey', 'such', 'provide', 'information', 'people', 'buying', 'film', 'might', 'like', 'know.Contrary', 'have', 'read', 'Amazon', 'film', 'description', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'based', 'life', 'Scottish', 'woman', 'married', 'RAF', 'pilot', 'Australian', 'came', 'international', 'news', 'report', 'shown', 'earlier', 'today', 'report', 'was', 'death', 'Nancy', 'Wake', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'English', 'nursing', 'home', 'Nancy', 'Wake', 'came', 'Australia', 'time', 'Germany', 'took', 'over', 'France', 'worked', 'French', 'underground', 'rescuing', 'downed', 'pilots', 'others', 'Germans', 'were', 'training', 'England', 'returned', 'France', 'became', 'THE', 'most', 'highly', 'decorated', 'French', 'underground', 'exploits', 'occupiers', 'especially', 'arrest', 'torture', 'execution', 'husband', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'sought', 'underground', 'operatives', 'German', 'military', 'was', 'never', 'arrested', 'probably', 'were', 'looking', 'man', 'not', 'expecting', 'women', 'was', 'capable.The', 'news', 'report', 'included', 'segment', 'interview', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'appeared', 'be', 'eighties', 'time', 'closing', 'comment', 'war', 'service', 'was', 'opinion', 'only', 'good', 'German', 'was', 'dead', 'was', 'dead', 'one', 'deader', 'better', 'will', 'say', 'news', 'report', 'specifically', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'Charlotte', 'Grey', 'being', 'based', 'events', 'Nancy', 'Wake', 'life']",Charlotte Gray VHS
590850,A2I4VTPKGSQZ75,B00005JKTE,Anthony Hand,"[8, 12]","Charlotte Grey stars the brilliant Cate Blanchet in a story reminiscent of the old British war movies about Odette Hallowes, 'Odette', or Violette Szabo 'Carve her name with pride'. All of these films have elements that intertwine with each other, such as strong women characters, wartime propaganda, romance, etc. But as a film of its type, ""Charlotte Grey"" fails quite badly.Grey is a Scot who falls for an RAF pilot, but their relationship is cut short when he is shot down over occupied France. On the basis of this, she then decides to join the SOE (Special Operations Executive) as a spy for the British. Which is severely undernourished as a plausible reason to grab a weapon and a bit of silk and jump into enemy territory.Her command of French comes in very handy (not that she'll need it for this film) and her strong will is helpful too, not to mention her unrealistic hyper-patriotic notions.After a disappointing and all too hasty ""training"" section of the film, Grey is dropped into France where...yes you guessed it...she falls in love again, this time with a member of the French resistance...of course she does. It seems to me sometimes, that all women can do in WWII films is fall in love with everyone within a 20km distance and ""Charlotte Grey"" is no exception unfortunately.From here the film falls rapidly down a seemingly never-ending hill and it's a hill sodden with tired old clich&eacute;s. Nothing much of consequence really happens and it's a shame, as the film could easily have been expanded into a far more entertaining and realistic exercise. The usual stereotypes of bad WWII movies are all here...The beautiful woman pining for her man, the noble French resistance (who all speak in mock French accents that sound like they're extras from the old BBC sitcom ""Allo Allo""), the slimy Vichy French and of course the ""evil"" Germans who, by the way, seem only to want to catch Jews and ship them off to Auschwitz. Like nothing else ever happened in WWII.All in all, this is a film that is severely truncated by the producers fear of actually making something different, other than the usual wartime trollop that's served up to a generally unknowing audience. Oh well, we'll have to mark it down as another missed opportunity.

""Soon,"" our heroine Charlotte Gray is told, ""you'll transform yourself from who you are now into somebody entirely different.""  So when Cate Blanchett's character is air dropped into occupied France (24 minutes into the film) a member of the French resistance asks, ""You are...?""  ""Dominique Guilbert,"" the 'former' Miss Gray responds, as they remove her from her parachute.  ""Welcome to France, Dominique.""  Thus begins her work as a British agent; having told her lover earlier that she too wanted to be brave, thus when her soldier-friend goes missing in France she decides to follow.  She had studied French when she was younger so they presumed that she could pass herself off as a Parisian.  For effect, in the beginning of the film, Miss Blanchett does utter some words of French, but not a word of it while in France itself.  Apparently, the makers of this film thought it be better if we only made believe all were speaking French (as all the characters speak nothing but English; or, I should say, all of the French and British characters, for the Germans do utilize their native tongue on occasion. Late in the film, for example, a Vichy French hack asks this of Michael Gambon's character: ""Do you have a certificate of non-belonging to the Jewish race?""  Then tells him that ""the aim of collaboration is, and always has been to safeguard the independence of French citizens.""  Simply put, such dialogue in English loses its import in my opinion. There's a fine Czech film about World War Two (Dark Blue World) that starts in Czech and thence when that film's characters make it to England intertwines Czech and English throughout the remainder of the film.  I wish they would have done likewise with ""Charlotte Gray.""  An above average film (such as this one is) set in war-torn France simply ought to have some French in it, I should think.  It would have improved the film, in my opinion.  Notwithstanding this criticism, ""Charlotte Gray"" still (albeit barely) works as a film.

590852,A3GQRM5HHD0CSM,B00005JKTE,"Brittney Reed ""garnet17""","[6, 7]","Do not buy this movie if you love battle scenes and action, action, and more action in your war movies. If you have a thing for gore and carnage, you will be very disappointed.The main focus of this movie is not the war in itself, but the effects of the war on people's lives, which is the only reason I have a thing for war stories. It is amazing to see ordinary people transformed into courageous heroes just for survival.This story is mainly a romance, in my opinion. Charlotte is willing to risk her life to travel to France in search of her lover, a pilot who went down over France and who is now trapped in its borders. But she is distracted from her mission by the plight of two little Jewish boys whose parents have been arrested. She and a handsome ally take the boys into hiding and care for them.

No great heroics or big setpieces, which is probably why it tanked: the big climax is more an emotional risk than the rescue audiences probably wanted.

Cate Blanchett conveys a very rich poetic substance which makes everything else around her seem prosaic and that is the problem with this film, everything except Cate Blanchett and the beautiful landscape seems prosaic. The supporting cast is not bad but they just do not compare with that central actress. The male actors who play Cates respective lovers seem to have been chosen for their profiles moreso than for their acting talent as neither are any kind of match for Cate so we don't believe she would look twice at either of these men she is supposed to be in love with. There is one other actor in the movie that is good and thats the grandfather but his character remains merely a background figure. The story is also a little unlikely.

She is an ambulance driver from Scotland working in London but is recruited by British Intelligence into the Special Operations Executive. Why? She has lived in France and speaks French like a native. Her first interview is actually on a train as the recruiter from MI6 pretends to be a fellow passenger and engages her in conversation. The SOE was actually sent by Winston Churchill behind enemy lines to as he so aptly put it, ""...set Europe ablaze..."" From assassinating high ranking Nazis like Reinhard Heydrich in Czechoslovakia to blowing up German bases, you name it and the SOE did it. The SOE actually helped to set up the OSS which was the forerunner of CIA. Cate Blanchett's acting is superb in her role as she displays a whole range of emotions from love to terror and sheer dogged determination. After tough Commando training including learning how to shoot Webley & Scott revolvers, Charlotte volunteers to go into Vichy France as a courier. Her superior asks her, ""Why do you want to go to France? You know only 1 in 3 come back."" Her real reason is that she hopes to find her RAF fighter pilot paramour with whom she has fallen madly in love. He had been shot down over Nazi occupied France. Parachuting into France in the dead of night, she links up with a French Resistance group and its dashing leader who confesses to her he is a Communist. I used to parachute and the parachuting scene is very well done as she lands amusingly right in the middle of a group of French boys. Her first contact, a French lady, is quickly arrested by the French Vichy Police in a Cafe but does not betray her. Charlotte has many deadly adventures with the Maquis including derailing trains with plastic explosives, and sees the ugly side of war plus the horrific effects of Hitler's anti-Jew policy. The French Maquis leader even wants to kill her when he mistakenly believes she has betrayed his group to the Nazis. They were all machinegunned down in a merciless Nazi ambush. The French Resistance leader's father is subsequently arrested by the Nazis for having Jewish blood and deported in a cattle truck. His enraged son takes revenge on the evil French philandering collaborator by shooting him dead in the heart without saying a single word. A very professional job!Charlotte manages to escape back to bombed out London and meets her fighter pilot paramour whom she had believed to be dead, KIA (killed in action). There is no happy reunion because she is now in love with the French Maquis leader. Ah, women are always fickle...Charlotte tells the boyish RAF pilot, ""You're right about war. It makes fools of us all..."" However, there is a really happy ending as she returns to France after the war to find her true love in his ancestral home, and delivers her classic line, ""There's something I've been meaning to tell you."" He replies, ""What?""Cate Blanchett says softly, ""My name...Charlotte Gray.""A very moving scene. It brought tears to my eyes. Please watch this movie and see if it touches your heart too. There are excellent scenes of Franec in this movie because it was filmed in the village of St. Antonin Noble Val in southwest France.

Only the strong survive, and dare to carry on.Cate Blanchette (Elizabeth: The Golden Age, Indiana Jones, & The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) plays the fantastic role as Charlotte, Scottish, who becomes an SOE (Special Operation Executive) agent. She joins to search for her lover, Peter, who is a RAF pilot shot down in France.Under an alias, Charlotte gets involved with the resistance, and entangled in the lives of some Jewish families. She hears that Peter is dead, but continues to help with the local French effort as well as hide a pair of Jewish boys. She comes under the influence of Julien, a resistance fighter, himself 1/8th Jewish. War, unfortunately continues to take its toll with the lives of people Charlotte contacts.The questions is, will Charlotte survive the 1 out of 3 odds of returning home?A great job of filming within a small French town, making the set and action very realistic. This film shows a part of WWII often ignored. It has beautiful sets, even for a war-ravaged country. ""Charlotte Gray"" is about touching relationships and has the unexpected ending. A DVD VALUE for historical drama and romance.

The photography is exquisite , the arresting images : specially this turn around the train is unforgettable but the entire script doesn't have punch . It is well told but you feel the absence of greatness . May be is the stylish documentary storytelling and the not succesfully developed sense of the drama what it strikes the film . But Gillian Armstring knows as all of we there are been so many stories about the tragedies of the war where the sense of heroism , betrayal, fatality and injustice are fundamental factors of the war . In that sense Armstrong focuses her attention much more in the dramatis personae experienced by Charlotte Gray that in the environment which surrounds her .The Gray chase in the house lacks credibility . Do you really expect it is so easy to get out and escape from the Gestapo with a simple gun ? .The dramatic device employed for Armstrong when the train is leaving and her efforts for writting a letter seem a filled tear handkerchief thrown to the great audience .But the splendid perfomance of Cate Blanchet (one of the best twelve actress in the world to date) and a worthable cast saves the film being a positive point .One of the most emblematic paradoxs in the film is you can find your expected love in the middle of the hell.The most remarkable acting after Blanchet is obviously Billy Crudup as Julien Lavarde .But the film will not remain in your memory .

In spite of all the knots in the story (and there's kind of a lot), this movie is genuinely humane and interesting, and it's worth your time because it has two unusual qualities that movies these days tend to lack...1. Real honest-to-God empathy.  In the space of a pretty short time (say the first 20 minutes or so), ""Charlotte Gray"" connects you in a genuine way with the strange intense heartache that young people caught in wartime feel -- Charlotte gets swept up in a kind of desperate whirlwind romance that only people who are really living next to death and radical uncertainty can feel.  There's a unique kind of sorrow in being forced by the world to live minute-to-minute, trapped in History's clutches, and the movie captures that.  Yes, we are at war as I write this, but our entire civilization and existence are not at stake quite the way they were 60 years ago... and the movie captures somewhat how people trying to be in love at that time must have felt.2.  One of the movie's greatest flaws is also its biggest strength: the story becomes so overcrowded and chaotic that it starts to actually resemble real life in the sense that, ""I have NO IDEA what is going to happen next!""  That feeling has got to be particularly acute in wartime, and in Charlotte's case (foreign agent leading double life behind enemy lines) it's completely nerve-wracking.  The story verges on being incoherent (structurally speaking, not morally speaking), but in today's movie climate of pre-packaged three-act structures with predictable breaks at every moment, that's kind of... refreshing.  Maybe I'm a naive viewer, but I really couldn't tell what was going to happen next, from moment to moment, and that kind of unpredictability is rare in movies these days (at least Hollywood ones).But of course, that same incoherence is what keeps the movie from developing a true center of gravity, and so it keeps it from being great.  The whole theme is so incredibly overcrowded (let me get this straight: she's an undercover agent AND an active member of the French Resistance AND she's searching for her downed-pilot lover behind enemy lines AND she's hiding Jewish children from the Nazis in her farmhouse?!?  Any ONE of these would have been more than enough for a slew of movies.)The most nerve-wracking scenes are the small ones, where normal people caught in strange situations simply DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.  That's a real human emotion, and a scary one.  The scene in the cafe, early on, is plain terrifying.  It's too bad the filmmakers didn't focus more on smaller strands of plot, which to my mind were already incredibly large.Not a 'great' movie, but a good (and beautiful-looking) one... and one that will maybe help you to be more human.",3,A sorrow beyond dreams,1126310400,"09 10, 2005",2005,2875,"['movie', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'crisply', 'acted', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'course', 'flawless', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'spite', 'knots', 'story', 'kind', 'lot', 'movie', 'genuinely', 'humane', 'interesting', 'time', 'two', 'unusual', 'qualities', 'movies', 'days', 'tend', 'lack', '1', 'Real', 'honest-to-God', 'empathy', 'space', 'pretty', 'short', 'time', 'say', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'Charlotte', 'Gray', 'genuine', 'way', 'strange', 'intense', 'heartache', 'young', 'people', 'caught', 'wartime', 'feel', 'Charlotte', 'swept', 'up', 'kind', 'desperate', 'whirlwind', 'romance', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'living', 'next', 'death', 'radical', 'uncertainty', 'can', 'feel', 'unique', 'kind', 'sorrow', 'being', 'forced', 'world', 'live', 'minute-to-minute', 'trapped', 'History', 'clutches', 'movie', 'Yes', 'are', 'war', 'write', 'entire', 'civilization', 'existence', 'are', 'not', 'stake', 'way', 'were', '60', 'years', 'ago', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'how', 'people', 'trying', 'be', 'love', 'time', 'must', 'have', 'felt.2', 'One', 'movie', 'greatest', 'flaws', 'also', 'biggest', 'strength', 'story', 'so', 'overcrowded', 'chaotic', 'actually', 'resemble', 'real', 'life', 'sense', 'have', 'IDEA', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'feeling', 'got', 'be', 'particularly', 'acute', 'wartime', 'Charlotte', 'case', 'foreign', 'agent', 'leading', 'double', 'life', 'enemy', 'lines', 'completely', 'nerve-wracking', 'story', 'verges', 'being', 'incoherent', 'structurally', 'speaking', 'not', 'morally', 'speaking', 'today', 'movie', 'climate', 'pre-packaged', 'three-act', 'structures', 'predictable', 'breaks', 'moment', 'kind', 'refreshing', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'naive', 'viewer', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'moment', 'moment', 'kind', 'unpredictability', 'rare', 'movies', 'days', 'least', 'Hollywood', 'ones', '.But', 'course', 'same', 'incoherence', 'what', 'movie', 'developing', 'true', 'center', 'gravity', 'so', 'being', 'great', 'whole', 'theme', 'so', 'incredibly', 'overcrowded', 'let', 'get', 'straight', 'undercover', 'agent', 'AND', 'active', 'member', 'French', 'Resistance', 'AND', 'searching', 'downed-pilot', 'lover', 'enemy', 'lines', 'AND', 'hiding', 'Jewish', 'children', 'Nazis', 'farmhouse', 'ONE', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'enough', 'slew', 'movies', 'most', 'nerve-wracking', 'scenes', 'are', 'small', 'ones', 'where', 'normal', 'people', 'caught', 'strange', 'situations', 'simply', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'KNOW', 'WHAT', 'TO', 'DO', 'real', 'human', 'emotion', 'scary', 'one', 'scene', 'cafe', 'early', 'plain', 'terrifying', 'too', 'bad', 'filmmakers', 'did', ""n't"", 'focus', 'more', 'smaller', 'strands', 'plot', 'mind', 'were', 'already', 'incredibly', ""'great"", 'movie', 'good', 'beautiful-looking', 'one', 'one', 'will', 'maybe', 'help', 'be', 'more', 'human']",Charlotte Gray VHS

It's easy to see why her career keeps climbing, she must be every writer & director's dream actress. You cxan easily imagine her playing any of the great roles--from Medea to Hedda Gabler to...well, to all the movies she's recently been in. Her beauty is at once breathtaking and simultaneously simply elegant.Her astonishing presence commanded every scene--and she was in every scence--which was a good thing, because as other reviewers indicated, there were some major problems with the script.I'll just mention a few here so as not to be repetitive of what other reviewers have already noted.For starters, the characterizations--particularly that of Charlotte--barely touch the surface of genuine personhood. She immediately falls in love with a hunk of a British officer, and when he crashes over France a few days later, Charolotte immediately signs up to be a conduit for the French Resistance (WWII)& before you can say ZAP! without any real training other than a scene that has the lovely Cate slevtly dressed in battle fatiques & showing she knows how to fire a gun--she's being parachuted into occupied France. What nonsense!The script--but for our heroine--is equally thin once she arrives. The Resistance is apparrently run like an incompetent social club, nobody seems to know what they're doing--except for Cate's character--and they are easily eliminated by the Nazis just when the audience would expect to see more of them. At one point even Blanchett's charcter expresses frustration and actually admits, ""I don't know what I'm doing here!""There is just enough grittiness to remind us that war is bad & the holocaust terrible; but even the Jewish boys Cate is helping to conceal from the Nazis seem to only be there so she can play a surrogate mother scene. If a film is going to invoke the holocaust, then it would really be advisable to have substance to it--that, or leave it out entirely. In fact, there are quite a few things that should have been put in or left out in CHAROLOTTE GRAY.I could go on, but won't.The movie & production values were good enough that I watched it twice. If truth be told, it was really just to watch Cate again.

590875,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JKTE,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","Cate Blanchett is too good of an actress for the title role in ""Charlotte Gray.""  I liked her performance, but the film did not really click for me because too many of the characters do too many stupid things.  In the context of this story these stupid things matter because most of the film takes place in Vichy France where stupid things can get you killed.  Adapted from Sebastian Faulks' novel by screenwriter Jeremy Brock, ""Charlotte Gray"" is about a Scottish woman who is doing what she can for King and Country during World War II.  Because she can speak fluent French, this means working on radio communications with the French Resistance movement.  But we get the feeling that she wants to do more, and certainly we think that she is capable of doing more; after all, this is Cate Blanchett.Then one evening at a party Charlotte meets Peter (Rupert Penry-Jones), a young airman.  Apparently they fall in love.  This matter is in doubt somewhat because they spend one passionate night together and when he gets shot down over France, Charlotte she decides to join British Special Operations, be trained to be a special agent, and dropped into France in the general vicinity of where Peter is supposed to be hiding with the Resistance.  It is certainly fortunate that Charlotte is sent by her King and Country to where she wants to go, but it is the impulsive decision to go through all that training that bothers me.  The French Resistance would be trying to get Peter home, so that it is not like Charlotte should be expecting him stay in one place until she shows up to rescue him.  What Charlotte is doing would be like finding out that a loved one has a medical problem and then rushing off to medical school to become a doctor so that you can save their life.  There has to be an easier way.But that actually does not matter because once Charlotte makes contact with the Resistance group she has a whole new set of problems.  The leader of the group is Julien Levade (Billy Crudup), who happens to be a Communist.  Charlotte's cover as ""Dominique"" is that she has fled Paris and is working for Julien's father (Michael Gambon).  There is a mission to blow up a train that Dominique gets to go along for absolutely no reason that I can think of given that her single talent is that she speaks French (well, and English).Then we have the moment where the bubble bursts.  Nazis march into the provincial French town and Julien stands up and starts screaming curses and the names of citizens who had been killed by the Germans and/or their French collaborators.  Dominique finds another talent useful for shutting Julien up, but even over the noise of the tanks the Nazis (and/or their French collaborators), should have spotted the angry French guy and taken out a Luger to shut him up.  But this is a film where the hero is betrayed by one of those collaborators not because he is the Nazi hating communist who leads the French Resistance in that neck of the woods but because it is seen as a way of forcing Dominique to submit sexually.Charlotte might have come to France for Peter but for Dominique the big concern is a pair of young Jewish boys whose parents have already been sent away to a ""work"" camp.  The boys are hiding with Levade's father and since Dominique is a woman she is put in charge of them, which basically means trying to keep anybody from discovering them.  This, more than finding Peter or resisting the Nazis, becomes her mission and it appears to be the hardest one of all.  The most memorable moment in ""Charlotte Gray"" concerns the one small victory that she can manage in the overwhelming situation in which she finds herself.There are three parts to the ending of this film, and what they underscore is what we suspected all along.  That Charlotte Gray really was in way over her head when she redirected her life.  In fact, if this film had ended with Dominique still in France, I would have had a higher opinion of it.  Instead, the point is muddled by making a point of finding out what happened to the film's unstated love triangle.  I can see how both Blanchette and director Gillian Armstrong would see the character of Charlotte Gray as being a stronger one than we usually find in World War II movies, but they still should have seen her problematic elements as well and have had them rectified before making this movie.  The performances by the principles are quite good, but they do not make up for the flaws in the story.",3,"""War makes us into people we didn't know we were""",1099440000,"11 3, 2004",2004,4472,"['Cate', 'Blanchett', 'too', 'good', 'actress', 'title', 'role', 'Charlotte', 'Gray', 'liked', 'performance', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'click', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'do', 'too', 'many', 'stupid', 'things', 'context', 'story', 'stupid', 'things', 'matter', 'most', 'film', 'place', 'Vichy', 'France', 'where', 'stupid', 'things', 'can', 'get', 'killed', 'Adapted', 'Sebastian', 'Faulks', 'novel', 'screenwriter', 'Jeremy', 'Brock', 'Charlotte', 'Gray', 'Scottish', 'woman', 'who', 'doing', 'what', 'can', 'King', 'Country', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'can', 'speak', 'fluent', 'French', 'working', 'radio', 'communications', 'French', 'Resistance', 'movement', 'get', 'feeling', 'do', 'more', 'certainly', 'think', 'capable', 'doing', 'more', 'Cate', 'Blanchett.Then', 'one', 'evening', 'party', 'Charlotte', 'meets', 'Peter', 'Rupert', 'Penry-Jones', 'young', 'airman', 'Apparently', 'fall', 'love', 'matter', 'doubt', 'somewhat', 'spend', 'one', 'passionate', 'night', 'together', 'when', 'shot', 'down', 'France', 'Charlotte', 'join', 'British', 'Special', 'Operations', 'be', 'trained', 'be', 'special', 'agent', 'dropped', 'France', 'general', 'vicinity', 'where', 'Peter', 'supposed', 'be', 'hiding', 'Resistance', 'certainly', 'fortunate', 'Charlotte', 'sent', 'King', 'Country', 'where', 'go', 'impulsive', 'decision', 'go', 'training', 'bothers', 'French', 'Resistance', 'would', 'be', 'trying', 'get', 'Peter', 'home', 'not', 'Charlotte', 'should', 'be', 'expecting', 'stay', 'one', 'place', 'up', 'rescue', 'What', 'Charlotte', 'doing', 'would', 'be', 'finding', 'out', 'loved', 'one', 'medical', 'problem', 'then', 'rushing', 'off', 'medical', 'school', 'become', 'doctor', 'can', 'save', 'life', 'be', 'easier', 'way.But', 'actually', 'not', 'matter', 'once', 'Charlotte', 'contact', 'Resistance', 'group', 'whole', 'new', 'set', 'problems', 'leader', 'group', 'Julien', 'Levade', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'who', 'be', 'Communist', 'Charlotte', 'cover', 'Dominique', 'fled', 'Paris', 'working', 'Julien', 'father', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'mission', 'blow', 'up', 'train', 'Dominique', 'go', 'along', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'can', 'think', 'given', 'single', 'talent', 'French', 'well', 'English', '.Then', 'have', 'moment', 'where', 'bubble', 'bursts', 'march', 'provincial', 'French', 'town', 'Julien', 'up', 'screaming', 'curses', 'names', 'citizens', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'Germans', 'and/or', 'French', 'collaborators', 'Dominique', 'talent', 'useful', 'shutting', 'Julien', 'up', 'even', 'noise', 'tanks', 'Nazis', 'and/or', 'French', 'collaborators', 'should', 'have', 'spotted', 'angry', 'French', 'guy', 'taken', 'out', 'Luger', 'shut', 'up', 'film', 'where', 'hero', 'betrayed', 'one', 'collaborators', 'not', 'Nazi', 'hating', 'communist', 'who', 'French', 'Resistance', 'neck', 'woods', 'seen', 'way', 'forcing', 'Dominique', 'submit', 'sexually.Charlotte', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'France', 'Peter', 'Dominique', 'big', 'concern', 'pair', 'young', 'Jewish', 'boys', 'parents', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'sent', 'away', 'work', 'camp', 'boys', 'are', 'hiding', 'Levade', 'father', 'Dominique', 'woman', 'put', 'charge', 'basically', 'trying', 'keep', 'anybody', 'discovering', 'more', 'finding', 'Peter', 'resisting', 'Nazis', 'mission', 'be', 'hardest', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'moment', 'Charlotte', 'Gray', 'one', 'small', 'victory', 'can', 'manage', 'overwhelming', 'situation', 'are', 'three', 'parts', 'ending', 'film', 'what', 'underscore', 'what', 'suspected', 'along', 'Charlotte', 'Gray', 'really', 'was', 'way', 'head', 'when', 'redirected', 'life', 'fact', 'film', 'had', 'ended', 'Dominique', 'still', 'France', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'higher', 'opinion', 'Instead', 'point', 'muddled', 'making', 'point', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'film', 'unstated', 'love', 'triangle', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'Blanchette', 'director', 'Gillian', 'Armstrong', 'would', 'see', 'character', 'Charlotte', 'Gray', 'being', 'stronger', 'one', 'usually', 'find', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'movies', 'still', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'problematic', 'elements', 'well', 'have', 'had', 'rectified', 'making', 'movie', 'performances', 'principles', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'flaws', 'story']",Charlotte Gray VHS

Director Gillian Armstrong (MRS. SOFFEL, LITTLE WOMEN, MY BRILLIANT CAREER) suffuses it with so much atmosphere, she didn't realize her plot became too far-fetched and squandered the considerable talents of her cast.  Cate Blanchett, recently awarded an Oscar for playing Katherine Hepburn in THE AVIATOR, glows in the title role.  Cate was born to play heroines from the forties, with her high cheekbones, dreamy eyes and gorgeous hair; and as an actress of considerable merit, she makes the best of a character we never fully understand or know.  How can she fall so helplessly in love with a one night fling?  Granted, Rupert Perry Jones is a fine looking lad, but Cate's character appears to be too intelligent to invest so much of herself in such an unfulfilled relationship.  From there on, the script bounces her around so much, we never fully understand exactly what her role in France is.  And why worry with her knowledge of French when everyone in France either speaks English or German?  Even Julien's father (played wonderfully by Michael Gambon) has a flawless British accent.  Credit Billy Crudup for doing so good in his sketchy role as the Communist French underground hero.  The film seems incredibly long, but it's not truly boring; it just doesn't impact us the way I think Armstrong wanted it to.

All her hallmarks, so wonderfully showcased in the appalling 'Oscar and Lucinda', are on display once again.  Characters with all the depth and complexity of shop window mannequins, are seen from all angles (thanks to cameras mounted in helicopters and on other forms of whirling apparatus) and in all manner of hackneyed situations, unveiling one earnest emotion after the next.  Mercifully, my friend and I managed to survive the film without falling victim to coincident cerebro-vascular accidents or some other fatal misfortune, because it would be regrettable to have this schmalzy garbage as one's last memory of this world.*The cinematography is striking, as is Ms.Cate Blanchett.  She wears a thrilling parade of French couture throughout the film, changing costume with a frequency that would make Barbara Streisand envious.  Her hair, despite wartime shortages, is also in immaculate condition and coiffure, and her make up is simply to die for.  She rides a bicycle with aplomb, and points a gun manfully.  Described early on as a most cunning linguist, she manages to speak English with a Scottish, an Australian, a fishy (or was that Vichy?) French, and quite possibly an Icelandic, accent: this feat in itself upstages the accomplishments of Meryl Streep, who needed a half dozen movies in order to employ her full complement of accents.  Billy Crudup only manages the regulation American, the botched English, and the wan French.  Still, he bests the rest of the cast, who don't bother attempting any accent at all.*The story's engine is love.  Kate meets a likely lad, a Royal Air Force chap in fact, one night at a soiree and ends up sharing a misty window pane with him the next morning, after a spot of wartime bedroom desperation.  He goes off to fight, and she, determined to be brave, follows.  Admirable indeed - a jolly capable young filly, what ho!

The training she received prior to leaving on her first mission makes this part believable.  However, the director chose to allow all the actors (except the Germans) to speak in their normal accents... Scottish, English, French, and American.  This was noticeably jarring at times, because you'd be thinking, ""Gee, the German soldiers or Vichy police should recognize THAT accent as a foreigner!""

Charlotte Gray had so much potential, it's a great-looking and atomospheric film with well-shot scenery and transporting period pieces, but it's allowed to wither away under lethargic pacing and a painfully diffuse screenplay.Blanchett pitches in a disarming performance as Charlotte. For a spy she sure cries a lot but does well to get herself out of a pinch. When the hero of the film, played quite handsomely by Billy Crudup, tucks away two Jewish boys at a crumbling shed (ice-cold cliche alert) she becomes the unofficial nanny. In short, she gets to enjoy 1940s women empowerment while also being fussily maternal, bringing a warm human dimension to wartime spy games.Problem is, we stumble from antic to dull antic without much focus and even our wondrous heroine can't help feeling equally confused, summing it all up perfectly with ""I don't know what I'm doing here anymore"".I still give it three stars for dabbling in rewarding themes, such as questioning the meaning of bravery or acknowledging how war's extremes can be transforming, but the campy dialogue doesn't help much. All too often the film's Wise Ideas sound like they came straight from chinese fortune cookies, like ""War makes fools of us all. The rest it kills"".

""Charlotte Gray,"" starring Cate Blanchett as the title role, is a film not to be missed for me.  And it's Cate Blanchette, so many films in these four years, and not a single bad performance with so many different roles.  So why not see this?  But sorry, I was very disappointed with it (not Cate, who is fabulous as ever).Charlotte Gray, as I said, is an English secret agent in occupied France with the false identity.  But her original motive was more than love for the country (which she has plenty); she wanted to seek for information on her missing love who was shot down in France.  But after she landed there, she realizes that her mission is far more dangerous than she thought, and moreover, she has to be in charge of two boys who, if found by the authority, are certain to be sent to concentration camps.  While deeply engaged in her work with the Resistance leader Billy Crudup, and his father Michael Gambon, her original purpose is forced to give way to more immediate needs; that is, survival of herself and her mates.The director Gillian Armstrong gives gorgeous costumes and pictures of France.  As she did in her excellent ""Little Women,"" Gillian Armstrong gives very credible portrait of countryside, but as to the script, the result is simply lamentable.  Many flaws can be seen -- uneven pace and unfocused tone of the whole picture, for instance -- but the most damaging is very unconvincing love story between the characters.  Despite the best efforts from Blanchett, Billy Crudup does not look like a guy with whom Charlotte is likely to fall in love.  Even the main character Charlotte's actions are inconsistent, sometimes making us wonder what she really wants to do.Inconsistent may be the best way describe the film's flaws.  After trained in Britain to speak French fluently, Charlotte drops her French language completely once she arrived at the country.  Is this for subtitle-phobias?  If so, they should have known that such careless decision for mainstream audience would kill the reality of the film.But as for cameleon-like Cate Blanchette, she deserves unanimous praise from all of us, who have seen her films with wonder.  Most regreattable thing is that obviously Billy Crudup is no match for her, and even veteran Michael Gambon suffers from the  underwritten screenplay.  ""Charlotte Gray"" is, therefore, for those fans who want to see another testimony that Cate is one of the best actresses of 21st century.
