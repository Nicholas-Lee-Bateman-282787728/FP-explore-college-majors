Image Entertainment rides to the rescue, though, with a new DVD release of this classic.When I say the movie is sweet, it manages to do so without being cheesy. Leslie Caron is in the title role as a young woman who finds herself pregnant after consummating her relationship with Marius, a young man who has a lust to travel and hates being tied down. The next day he leaves for a long sea journey. When Fanny learns of her condition, she accepts a proposal from the elderly Panisse (Maurice Chevalier) and he gives all of his love and acceptance to both her and her child. Marius returns after the child is born, never having known until he returns that he is a father. He wants Fanny back, and he and Panisse square off in a showdown over both Fanny and her child. However, Fanny has something to say about this too. It's a great film about love, responsibility, selfishness, and the root of true happiness.It is my favorite Leslie Caron movie and a great role for Chevalier in his later years.

350178,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,6303002064,Carlisle Wheeling,"[1, 1]","I saw this movie for the first time about 5 years ago on TCM and fell in love at first viewing.  It took a few years for me to purchase it from Ammy, but I have to say that my affection for this Joshua Logan film grows with each time I watch it.  Why don't they make movies like this anymore?  You know, with scripts that use subtle innuendos instead of outright vulgarity, wonderful storylines that don't rely on cookie cutter formula, and ""beautiful"" starlets who are ACTUALLY beautiful like Leslie Caron was in her day.  Handsome leads who were almost beautiful like the seldom heard-of Horst Bucholz...Oh, but this gorgeous French based film takes my breath away, and it is in my top five favorite movies of all time!  The story involves Fanny (Leslie Caron at her most beautiful), the daughter of a seaside fishmonger and Marius (drop-dead dreamy Horst Bucholz), a barkeeper's son, and the way they have loved each other since childhood.  Unfortunately, though they become lovers for a night, Marius's sea lust is so strong that Fanny lets him go, and she ends up in trouble.  Maurice Chevalier is wonderful as older suitor Panisse in a sympathetic and kindly role as the rich older man who weds Fanny to save her and her child from social disgrace.  Unfortunately, things are not that easy; even when Marius is not present in their lives, he's still there, and sooner or later something will have to give.Charles Boyer as Marius' father and Maurice Chevalier have a distinct onscreen chemistry that clicks as bickering friends and wonderful support for Fanny as Marius tries to  beckon her away.  One scene that is particularly hilarious is when Fanny shamelessly flirts with Panisse on her 18th birthday at a table while Marius bartends, beet red with jealousy.  Marius simultaneously calls him a lecher and a eunich, at which Fanny says that Panisse can't be both.  That always makes me laugh.  A most touching moment in the movie is when Marius insists on claiming Cesario as his son, and Fanny tells him how Panisse dealt with her during the birthing process.  ""He said 'scratch me, bite me; the more you hurt me, the more the child will be mine.'""  Truly a tear-jerking moment.That is the wonderful thing about this old classic gem.  One moment you're laughing, and the next you're on the verge of tears.  With beautiful scenery, a lovely soundtrack, and excellent dialogue, Fanny is a work of art made for the romantic's romantic, and it is truly, hauntingly unforgettable.

Marius has other plans and wants to see the world by becoming a seaman.  Before he leaves he and Fanny spend the night together.  While he is gone, Fanny finds herself pregnant and accepts the proposal of older (much!) and wealthy merchant Panisse (Maurice Chevalier).

350183,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6303002064,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 6]","Ending a decade-long string of gamine roles that started with her propitious debut as Gene Kelly's unattainable object of desire in Vincente Minnelli'sAn American in Paris, Leslie Caron plays the title role, a poor 18-year-old Marseilles girl who helps her fortune-hunting mother sell fish on their waterfront boat stall. Even though she was thirty in real life, Caron is genuinely affecting in conveying the character's youthful vigor and romantic yearning. Directed by Joshua Logan (Picnic) in his familiar overwrought manner, the time-spanning 1961 drama is really an intimate story that suffers somewhat from overly deliberate pacing and excessive length (it's 134 minutes long). Offsetting those flaws are some lighthearted comic touches mainly in the first half, a sterling cast, and Jack Cardiff's (Black Narcissus) vibrant, often painterly cinematography which brings a lustrous glow to the seaside setting.Adapted by Julius J. Epstein (Casablanca) from Marcel Pagnol's famous Gallic trilogy, the story revolves around Fanny's pining for her lifelong love, Marius, the hot-tempered son of waterfront caf&eacute; owner Cesar. While he obviously loves Fanny, Marius has a greater passion to escape his humdrum life to become a seaman. He gets his golden opportunity when a scientific research vessel docks in Marseilles, and he can sign on for a five-year hitch. On the night before he leaves and with Fanny's mother away, they share a night of unbridled passion. Truly conflicted about his feelings for her, Marius leaves but only after Fanny tells him that she will marry the sixtyish Panisse, a lonely sailmaker who constantly locks horns with Cesar. The rest of the soap opera plot plays out the way you would think and eventually skips a decade to find that choices made are not as final as they seem.The movie is simply beautiful to look at, and even though Logan and Cardiff tend to rely on extreme close-ups for dramatic emphasis, the story is engaging. Despite the fact that she is playing a teenager for most of the film, Caron shows how she has truly evolved as an actress since her plucked-from-obscurity MGM debut. Fresh from his memorable role as a Mexican gunman inThe Magnificent Seven, German actor Horst Buchholz smolders appropriately as Marius although his character inevitably becomes more unsympathetic as the story unfolds. The scene stealers are Charles Boyer as Cesar and Maurice Chevalier as Panisse, both peaking in late-career roles that suit their distinctive personalities. This was the least known to me of the five 1961 Best Picture nominees (the others wereThe Guns of Navarone,The Hustler,Judgment at Nuremberg, and the runaway winner,West Side Story) - but it is a Gallic-flavored gem well worth viewing now that it has been released on DVD.

(Charles Boyer in ""Fanny,"" 1961)When my husband and I were renting a car in Toulouse, we were asked if we were going into Marseille because, if we were, we needed to purchase extra insurance. We assumed that this was because Marseille was an especially hazardous place; our plans had not included venturing there, anyway. In spite of its perilous reputation, Marseille, the ancient port city founded by the Greeks, would be fascinating to visit. Of the many films that take place in Marseille, my favorite is ""Fanny,"" based upon the musical of the same name. Both film and musical were taken from a trilogy of plays by French writer Marcel Pagnol. Leslie Caron is radiant in the title role; Horst Buchholz plays the intense Marius, torn between love for Fanny and a desire to see the world. Maurice Chevalier is Panisse, the well-to-do elderly merchant who marries Fanny and adopts her baby as his own. The best of all is Charles Boyer as C&eacute;sar, Marius' father. In his earlier roles Boyer was so handsome and suave that it distracted from his acting abilities. As the crusty, aging owner of the waterfront caf&eacute;, he shines with earthy wisdom, and becomes the conscience for the other characters.In a effort to keep Marius from going to sea, Fanny gives herself to him, to no avail. Seeing that he is aching to leave Marseille, she releases him from their engagement. He is unaware that she is with child. Fanny is covered with shame and regret. Truly resplendent is the scene in which Fanny visits the cathedral to beg forgiveness, imploring the Holy Virgin for guidance. She decides to do what will be best for the baby and marry the worthy Panisse. Panisse showers Fanny and her son with love and care. When Marius returns and Fanny is tempted to betray Panisse, she chooses honor and duty over passion. She has learned her lesson. And yet, throughout the film, her eyes convey longing for Marius and her sorrow over losing him. But all is not lost; her sacrifices are abundantly rewarded.The film shows how the coming of a child can be the catalyst for positive change in many lives, even though the original circumstances were far from ideal. By surrendering to God, Fanny's fall from grace is transformed into a channel of blessings.",5,All the love stories rolled into one.....,1213920000,"06 20, 2008",2008,2344,"['C', 'Eacute', 'SAR', 'know', 'Marius', 'woman', 'honor', 'match', 'can', 'only', 'use', 'once', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'Fanny', '1961', 'When', 'husband', 'were', 'renting', 'car', 'Toulouse', 'were', 'asked', 'were', 'going', 'Marseille', 'were', 'needed', 'purchase', 'extra', 'insurance', 'assumed', 'was', 'Marseille', 'was', 'especially', 'hazardous', 'place', 'plans', 'had', 'not', 'included', 'venturing', 'there', 'anyway', 'spite', 'perilous', 'reputation', 'Marseille', 'ancient', 'port', 'city', 'founded', 'Greeks', 'would', 'be', 'fascinating', 'visit', 'many', 'films', 'take', 'place', 'Marseille', 'favorite', 'Fanny', 'based', 'musical', 'same', 'name', 'film', 'musical', 'were', 'taken', 'trilogy', 'plays', 'French', 'writer', 'Marcel', 'Pagnol', 'Leslie', 'Caron', 'radiant', 'title', 'role', 'Horst', 'Buchholz', 'intense', 'Marius', 'torn', 'love', 'Fanny', 'desire', 'see', 'world', 'Maurice', 'Chevalier', 'Panisse', 'well-to-do', 'elderly', 'merchant', 'who', 'Fanny', 'baby', 'own', 'best', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'C', 'eacute', 'Marius', 'father', 'earlier', 'roles', 'Boyer', 'was', 'so', 'handsome', 'suave', 'distracted', 'acting', 'abilities', 'crusty', 'aging', 'owner', 'waterfront', 'caf', 'eacute', 'earthy', 'wisdom', 'conscience', 'other', 'characters.In', 'effort', 'keep', 'Marius', 'going', 'sea', 'Fanny', 'avail', 'Seeing', 'aching', 'leave', 'Marseille', 'engagement', 'unaware', 'child', 'Fanny', 'covered', 'shame', 'regret', 'Truly', 'resplendent', 'scene', 'Fanny', 'cathedral', 'beg', 'forgiveness', 'imploring', 'Holy', 'Virgin', 'guidance', 'do', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'best', 'baby', 'marry', 'worthy', 'Panisse', 'Panisse', 'showers', 'Fanny', 'son', 'love', 'care', 'When', 'Marius', 'returns', 'Fanny', 'tempted', 'betray', 'Panisse', 'honor', 'duty', 'passion', 'learned', 'lesson', 'yet', 'film', 'eyes', 'convey', 'longing', 'Marius', 'sorrow', 'losing', 'not', 'lost', 'sacrifices', 'are', 'abundantly', 'rewarded.The', 'film', 'how', 'coming', 'child', 'can', 'be', 'catalyst', 'positive', 'change', 'many', 'lives', 'even', 'original', 'circumstances', 'were', 'far', 'ideal', 'surrendering', 'God', 'Fanny', 'fall', 'grace', 'transformed', 'channel', 'blessings']",N/A

Caron is a lovely Fanny and Buchholz's Marius is dreamy and full of angst; their love spans many years and we see them grow up and mature.

Horst Buchholz and Leslie Caron portray these two young people, Marius and Fanny.  However, choice intrudes into the otherwise smooth flow of events and unplanned consequences occur.This is a complex story.  Marius is the son of a tavern owner.  Fanny is the daughter of a fish purveyor in Marsailles.  You can see that their fate is pre-ordained.Early in the story Marius and Fanny become lovers.  You would expect the two to marry.  But there is a restlessness in Marius that is eating in him like acid.  He does not want to be the next tavern owner.  His horizons are those of the sea and when an oceanographic ship comes into port, he ships out as a member of the crew.Events unfold quickly upon his departure.  Fanny discovers she is pregnant.  Her mother threatens to disown her.  A ship chandler played by Maurice Chevalier steps in and offers to marry her and save her from the shame and ridicule that an out of wedlock birth would have produced.  Marius father, played by Charles Boyer, at first is against the marriage but soon comes around to agreeing to it.Marius is gone but he is always present - like a spectre.  Fanny has never forgotten him, nor has his father and fanny's husband.Briefly, Marius returns to Marsailles to pick up a part for the ship.  He meets Fanny and learns he is a father but that his son is being raised by another man.  This meeting is extremely moving as all the charecters come together for a moment of truth.Yet the film continues on.  Marius son grows older and through the intervention of a friend of Marius', he meets Marius but doesn't know he is his father.  All he knows is that the man is a friend of his mother.  He learns what Marius life has been like since he left Marsailles and it is far from what Marius had expected.The climax of the film is wonderful and extremely moving.This film combines a fine cast, both principles and supporting members,  with marvelous locations and a compeling theme.  I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the Marsailles Trilogy.  This is an extremely powerful and moving film.

It holds up well as a look at that time and place, with universal themes of love and lust and pain and at what price dreams come. It illustrated narrowness of mind, largeness of heart, and how one man's prison is another man's palace. I thought all the characters had good chemistry with each other, and Fanny and Marius' relationship was searing. The comedic lines were great too.In my opinion, regarding some comments in other reviews, I didn't think Panisse was a ""kindly old gentleman"" who just wanted to help Fanny in her hour of need. I thought he was a dirty old man. His behavior with her in the cafe was lecherous, and remember, he wanted to marry Fanny before Marius had even left. I highly doubt he just wanted a checkers partner. So his kindly bit, just helping Fanny in her hour of need, didn't wash with me.  Also at the end he said that he had had an ongoing sexual relationship with one of his employees, which is already skeevy, and was she young and beautiful, like Fanny?Comments were also made about Cesario. I didn't see anything strange at all about his wanting to sail away with Marius. It wasn't like Marius was a stranger off the street. Though Cesario didn't know him, he was Cesario's godfather's son, and known and liked by his whole family. I thought Cesario's behavior back at the house quite natural too, though comments mentioned his playing on the trampoline while Panisse was dying, as wrong.  Panisse was very old and they said he had been expected to die years before, so most likely Panisse had been an invalid, or mostly so, most of Cesario's life. It would be natural to him to see Panisse in bed, to talk to him there, as he did, and hug him, and then go on about his life. Who would say to him, ""you must stay here and watch Panisse die!""I also think that Fanny and Marius were together after Panisse's death, but I think they had some things to work through first, especially Marius. He was the one most hurt by the way things had turned out, his seafaring dreams turned to ashes, and Fanny and his son taken by a man he despised. Though he found out about the baby when Cesario was a year old, there was nothing he could do. Fanny would never have left Panisse without her son, and that bit of emotional blackmail was reprehensible. I wish Fanny could have realized what a horrible man Panisse really was, using his money to buy and manipulate people.I think they also told Cesario about Marius being his father, maybe when he was a little older.This is just a really good movie, with stellar performances by Leslie Caron and Horst Buchholz.",4,Very good film!,1356048000,"12 21, 2012",2012,2696,"['SPOILERS', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'loved', 'just', 'saw', 'again', 'years', 'later', 'up', 'well', 'look', 'time', 'place', 'universal', 'themes', 'love', 'lust', 'pain', 'what', 'price', 'dreams', 'come', 'illustrated', 'narrowness', 'mind', 'largeness', 'heart', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'prison', 'man', 'palace', 'thought', 'characters', 'had', 'good', 'chemistry', 'other', 'Fanny', 'Marius', 'relationship', 'was', 'searing', 'comedic', 'lines', 'were', 'great', 'too.In', 'opinion', 'regarding', 'comments', 'other', 'reviews', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Panisse', 'was', 'kindly', 'old', 'gentleman', 'who', 'just', 'wanted', 'help', 'Fanny', 'hour', 'need', 'thought', 'was', 'dirty', 'old', 'man', 'behavior', 'cafe', 'was', 'lecherous', 'remember', 'wanted', 'marry', 'Fanny', 'Marius', 'had', 'even', 'left', 'highly', 'doubt', 'just', 'wanted', 'checkers', 'partner', 'kindly', 'bit', 'just', 'helping', 'Fanny', 'hour', 'need', 'did', ""n't"", 'wash', 'Also', 'end', 'said', 'had', 'had', 'ongoing', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'one', 'employees', 'already', 'skeevy', 'was', 'young', 'beautiful', 'Fanny', 'Comments', 'were', 'also', 'made', 'Cesario', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'strange', 'wanting', 'sail', 'away', 'Marius', 'was', ""n't"", 'like', 'Marius', 'was', 'stranger', 'street', 'Cesario', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'Cesario', 'godfather', 'son', 'known', 'liked', 'whole', 'family', 'thought', 'Cesario', 'behavior', 'back', 'house', 'quite', 'natural', 'too', 'comments', 'mentioned', 'playing', 'trampoline', 'Panisse', 'was', 'dying', 'wrong', 'Panisse', 'was', 'very', 'old', 'said', 'had', 'been', 'expected', 'die', 'years', 'most', 'likely', 'Panisse', 'had', 'been', 'invalid', 'mostly', 'so', 'most', 'Cesario', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'natural', 'see', 'Panisse', 'bed', 'talk', 'there', 'did', 'hug', 'then', 'go', 'life', 'Who', 'would', 'say', 'must', 'stay', 'here', 'watch', 'Panisse', 'die', 'also', 'think', 'Fanny', 'Marius', 'were', 'together', 'Panisse', 'death', 'think', 'had', 'things', 'work', 'first', 'especially', 'Marius', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'hurt', 'way', 'things', 'had', 'turned', 'out', 'seafaring', 'dreams', 'turned', 'ashes', 'Fanny', 'son', 'taken', 'man', 'despised', 'found', 'out', 'baby', 'when', 'Cesario', 'was', 'year', 'old', 'was', 'nothing', 'could', 'do', 'Fanny', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'left', 'Panisse', 'son', 'bit', 'emotional', 'blackmail', 'was', 'reprehensible', 'wish', 'Fanny', 'could', 'have', 'realized', 'what', 'horrible', 'man', 'Panisse', 'really', 'was', 'using', 'money', 'buy', 'manipulate', 'people.I', 'think', 'also', 'told', 'Cesario', 'Marius', 'being', 'father', 'maybe', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'older.This', 'just', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'stellar', 'performances', 'Leslie', 'Caron', 'Horst', 'Buchholz']",N/A

I have seen this movie dozens of times over the years since it was released and am always moved to tears.  The musical score is beautiful and haunting.  Performances by the entire cast are superb.  I have never been a Maurice Chevalier or Charles Boyer fan, but both are perfect in their roles. The movie, taken from the ""Marseille"" trilogy by Marcel Pagnol, is set, not surprisingly,in Marseille, France. The scenery is stunning. How do I classify this film?  Well, it has plenty of heartbreak and joy and lots of amusing moments. It is definitely a comedy, but it is first and foremost, in my mind, a love story on multiple levels--the love between man and woman; between parent and child; and among friends. And the audience will also be in love with the richly developed characters, who, on the surface may seem comical and somewhat innocent, but who have inner strengths of character and determination that enable them to form strong and lasting bonds of mutual respect and devotion.",5,Ultimate Chick Flick,1331078400,"03 7, 2012",2012,1033,"['Fanny', 'be', 'ultimate', 'chick', 'flick', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'times', 'years', 'was', 'released', 'am', 'always', 'moved', 'tears', 'musical', 'score', 'beautiful', 'haunting', 'Performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'are', 'superb', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'Maurice', 'Chevalier', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'fan', 'are', 'perfect', 'roles', 'movie', 'taken', 'Marseille', 'trilogy', 'Marcel', 'Pagnol', 'set', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'Marseille', 'France', 'scenery', 'stunning', 'How', 'do', 'classify', 'film', 'Well', 'plenty', 'heartbreak', 'joy', 'lots', 'amusing', 'moments', 'definitely', 'comedy', 'first', 'foremost', 'mind', 'love', 'story', 'multiple', 'levels', 'love', 'man', 'woman', 'parent', 'child', 'friends', 'audience', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'love', 'richly', 'developed', 'characters', 'who', 'surface', 'may', 'seem', 'comical', 'somewhat', 'innocent', 'who', 'have', 'inner', 'strengths', 'character', 'determination', 'enable', 'form', 'strong', 'lasting', 'bonds', 'mutual', 'respect', 'devotion']",N/A
