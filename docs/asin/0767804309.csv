7608,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,0767804309,andy8047,"[1, 3]","LOOK WHO'S TALKING is about a newborn baby,voiced by Bruce Willis. Willis verbalizes the baby's thoughts. Kirstie Alley,star of the hit sitcom Cheers,plays the baby's mother Mollie. The birth of Mikey occurred as a result of a sexual escapade between Mollie and a male co-worker(George Segal). Just as she's about to go into labor,she hails a taxi,driven by James Ubriacco(John Travolta). Mollie tells her mom and dad that she was artificially inseminated. Mollie's mom(Olympia Dukakis) says in one scene,""You and the frozen pop are having a baby."" James shows up at Molly's apartment,returning her wallet that she left in James' cab(The address on Molly's ID was helpful). So Mollie hires James to be Mikey's babysitter. Albert,Mikey's father shows up at Mollie's in another scene. In the same scene,James asks Albert a few questions regarding Mikey's biography. Also,James plans to use Mollie's Manhattan address to set up a residency for James' grandfather(Abe Vigoda) who has been evicted from an old age home and James found a place for him in the same town. James himself does not live in Manhattan that's why he used Mollie's address to move his grandfather into his new place(obviously non-Manhattan residents can't welcome new residents into the facility). In James' grandfather's new home,Mikey is seen in one scene roaming around the facility and ends up wandering off into the heavy New York City traffic. Terrified Mollie and James drive all over the city and finally find Mikey,bringing an abundance of relief. So Mollie and James fall in love and in one of the last scenes,Mollie gives birth to Mikey's half-sister Julie,whose father is James. This film is Travolta's first major hit since ""Urban Cowboy"" in 1980. Travolta had many not-so-successful films in the 80's including ""Two Of A Kind"",""Perfect"" and ""Blowout"". However,""Staying Alive"" got mixed reviews and was somewhat successful because of its predecessor,""Saturday Night Fever"". Previously,Alley co-starred with Sidney Poitier and Tom Berenger in the action-packed ""Shoot To Kill"". That film was one of her pre-Cheers projects.

While appreciative of his mother's embrace, the baffled newborn pensively ponders his confusion about his new whereabouts while sucking a pacifier.Around him are many crying nursery mates.Realizing her mistake in bringing her new son into the world under the circumstances in which he came into it, Molly vows to find her young son the best father she can find for him.We find Molly and son back at their apartment. James tracks them down to return Molly's purse, and vows to babysit for Molly on her evenings out.As James begins to bond with the precocious infant, Molly has a series of unsuccessful dates, and finally confronts Albert, attempting one last time to get him to take responsibility for the son he brought into the world.In return for his help, Molly helps James deal with his grandfather (Abe Vigoda), as he relocates to a new nursing home.Interspersed with all this are Mikey's thoughts as he  lives, loves, laughs, gets into mischief, ultimately playing Cupid and helping his Mom find happiness.I admire the realism in showing Molly paying consequences for her affair, but in this witty tale, filled with a lot of heart, we feel glad that the best outcome for these flawed but likeable people prevails.",5,Baby Mikey's Eventful First Year,1309910400,"07 6, 2011",2011,2740,"['Inspired', 'director', 'Amy', 'Heckerling', 'imagined', 'dialogue', 'then-infant', 'daughter', 'lively', 'comedy', 'proves', 'be', 'engaging', 'piece', 'beginning', 'end.In', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'late', '1980s', 'attractive', 'young', 'accountant', 'named', 'Molly', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'affair', 'married', 'client', 'named', 'Albert', 'George', 'Segal', 'resulting', 'conception', 'infant', 'son', 'be', 'named', 'Mikey', 'portrayed', 'Jason', 'Schaller', 'Jaryd', 'Waterhouse', 'Jacob', 'Haines', 'Christopher', 'Aydon', 'voiced', 'irrepressable', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'discovery', 'pregancy', 'see', 'illicit', 'relationship', 'progress', 'find', 'Molly', 'spying', 'lover', 'family', 'reluctant', 'co-', 'worker', 'Rona', 'Twink', 'Caplan', 'tow.Molly', 'parents', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'Louis', 'Heckerling', 'are', 'constant', 'daughter', 'life', 'frequently.But', 'Molly', 'insecure', 'relationship', 'baby', 'father', 'keeps', 'making', 'empty', 'promises', 'one', 'day', 'clothing', 'store', 'Rona', 'Albert', 'affair', 'interior', 'designer', 'Melissa', 'Joy', 'Boushel', 'shock', 'discovery', 'go', 'labor.Deprived', 'cab', 'first', 'attempt', 'hail', 'one', 'given', 'lift', 'hospital', 'cab', 'driver', 'named', 'James', 'John', 'Travolta', 'verge', 'renewing', 'level', 'popularity', 'enjoyed', ""'70s"", 'who', 'mistaken', 'father', 'hustled', 'delivery', 'room.Little', 'Mikey', 'who', 'had', 'immensely', 'fun', 'time', 'prenatal', 'stages', 'traumatized', 'confused', 'entrance', 'world', 'appreciative', 'mother', 'embrace', 'baffled', 'newborn', 'pensively', 'confusion', 'new', 'whereabouts', 'sucking', 'pacifier.Around', 'are', 'many', 'crying', 'nursery', 'mates.Realizing', 'mistake', 'bringing', 'new', 'son', 'world', 'circumstances', 'came', 'Molly', 'find', 'young', 'son', 'best', 'father', 'can', 'find', 'him.We', 'find', 'Molly', 'son', 'back', 'apartment', 'James', 'down', 'return', 'Molly', 'purse', 'vows', 'babysit', 'Molly', 'evenings', 'out.As', 'James', 'bond', 'precocious', 'infant', 'Molly', 'series', 'unsuccessful', 'dates', 'finally', 'confronts', 'Albert', 'attempting', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'get', 'take', 'responsibility', 'son', 'brought', 'world.In', 'return', 'help', 'Molly', 'James', 'deal', 'grandfather', 'Abe', 'Vigoda', 'new', 'nursing', 'home.Interspersed', 'are', 'Mikey', 'thoughts', 'loves', 'laughs', 'mischief', 'ultimately', 'playing', 'Cupid', 'helping', 'Mom', 'find', 'happiness.I', 'admire', 'realism', 'showing', 'Molly', 'paying', 'consequences', 'affair', 'witty', 'tale', 'filled', 'lot', 'heart', 'feel', 'glad', 'best', 'outcome', 'flawed', 'likeable', 'people', 'prevails']",N/A

7617,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,0767804309,General Breadbasket,"[10, 10]","""Look Who's Talking"" is probably my favorite film with Kirstie Alley, my favorite film with John Travolta (though ""Grease"" comes close) and my favorite film with Bruce Willis (though I'm not exactly a fan of his). It's funny, it's romantic, it's got some innovative special effects, a couple of car chases, and John Travolta even gets to fly a plane (which he must have really enjoyed at the time!).Kirstie Alley plays Mollie, an accountant who has an office affair with one of her clients (George Segal), and ends up getting pregnant. It wasn't planned, and she's a little ashamed of the source, but Mollie soon warms to the idea of having a baby. After a traumatic day late in the preganacy, Mollie goes into labor in the middle of the bustling streets of New York, and takes a cab driven by the easy going James (John Travolta). Though it's not really what he wants to do (he wants to be a pilot) he's very good at driving a cab, and gets Mollie there very quickly. She has the baby, Mikey, and he's something of a thinker (voice/thoughts spoken by Bruce Willis), wondering to himself what this strange world around him is, and who these strange people around him are. He starts to grow up as time goes on, and Mollie decides to look for a father. She made a mistake, and she owes it to Mikey to find him a Dad. She dates here, she dates there, but could the right Dad be staring her in the face this whole time?Everyone plays their part well, and the plot flows really nicely, bit of action, bit of a thoughtful moment, bit of a laugh. It's a romatic comedy of sorts, and it's a funny look at early motherhood, it's interesting seeing both happening at the same time. It's one of those films I can watch again and again, and have done over the years. The soundtrack is great too, a mixture of some older pop hits and contemporary 1980s tunes (including ""Dumb Things"" by Australian musician Paul Kelly during the taxi labor scene, a song I really like).Overall, it's a sweet and funny little film, a definitely worth a look for fans of anyone in it.

A lot of the jokes are aimed at the adult audience, rather than teaching kids how they came into the world - it wasn't by a stork!With all the recent bad press about Kirstie Alley's weight gain, it's good to watch her, when she was still reasonably slim. And she looks great in this film. Especially when she does the little dance, while feeding Mikey, and John Travolta walks in.Although John Travolta will never be as good as he was in Grease, this is one of those movies, where he provides the laughs, and genuinely looks quite nice - especially when he has the bruise, after Mikey's real dad hits him with a phone! (You just wanna kiss him all better!) His love of beer and fast food is beginning to show in this, as he has a little stomach, which then becomes a big stomach for Pulp Fiction!I'm never quite sure as Bruce Willis as the voice of Mikey. When I was younger, I probably didn't see a lot of Bruce Willis in movies, and still to this day, I don't really recognise his voice. He's trying too hard to have a high voice, and sure, on certain words, he lets slip, and you can hear its him. But it just doesn't sound like him.This is a terrific film, to watch as a youngster, and as an adult, and be able to appreciate the sexual chemistry between John & Kirstie. It's funny, and although, the sequels aren't as good, when are they?

I think these amazon people take things too seriously or don't have kids, or have such stressful lives they can't enjoy any kind of humor these movies have. I even enjoyed it when it came out and i was still in elementary school. My mom enjoyed it, and she loved babies and everything that had to do with babies and kids. Parents would enjoy this movie, not all but most. I'm not even one of those ""kid lovers"" I like kids, but not obsessed or anything like many kid lovers are. But LOOK WHO'S TALKING is a simple comedy with many funny parts like when kirstie alley's voice turned into a devil voice as she went into labor, because of the pain. To me, and my mom that part was hilarious and many women could relate to that because giving birth is no picnic, especially when it's your first baby. I've never given birth, but i've heard the stories. Anyways, i also read many amazon people's reviews about how horrible look who's talking too was, i'm thinkin' what is wrong with people nowadays? That was a cute movie too, the baby girl was as cute as a button, and the acting wasn't bad. I dont understand that. And at the end when mikey took his baby sisters's hand and they walked, and you could see her wobbling, and that cute baby walk which is so cute words can't describe, and the song i got you babe added to the moment. What's not to love, that was an adorable ending all i could say was AWWWWWW!!! people need to lighten up, especially if you wanna be good parents. Try to enjoy life, and not take things so seriously. These movies were basically about that. All those little funny and heartwarming moments when your kid is born and starts to grow and learn. But LOOK WHO'S TALKING NOW i must agree with the others because it was horrible. It doesn't make sense frankly, the first two films were about talking babies, why go to dogs? I like dogs and everything buy WHY? It's almost embarassing to watch. Kind of absurd and yes the acting was horrific, and cheeesy script, and everything in the film was flat out stupid. What next talking furniture and appliances lol.

They aren't married, so Mollie claims it was artificial insemination. One day, Mollie finds Albert cheating on her so it was over between them. But then, her water broke and she had to be rushed to the hospital. Who should happen along but cab driver James Ubriacco. The midtown traffic was a disaster but James drove as fast as possible. Mollie's baby was soon born. He was named Mikey. He began to comment in his mind about everything he saw.  James dropped in on Mollie one afternoon to return her purse which she had left in the cab. James even took Mikey out while Mollie took a nap. They went to go visit James' grandfather in a rest home and to the air field because aside from being a cab driver, James was a pilot. Mollie expressed her distaste of James unexpectedly taking Mikey out by hitting him; Mollie was looking for a suitable father figure for Mikey and James looked like a sure winner, but she won't even consider James. She dates several other guys while James babysits Mikey. He teaches him to dance and we all know John ""Saturday Night Fever"" Travolta is a heck of a dancer. But as luck would have it, Mollie and James begin to get close. Albert comes by one day and meets James, who interrogates Albert on what Mikey's favorite cereal was, how many diapers he goes through a day, favorite rock star, standard stuff a father should know. Albert also proved dull when Mollie and Mikey go to visit him. So that was it for him.  James takes Mollie flying one afternoon. They go to visit James' grandfather and the events of the day are as follows: Mikey experiences what driving a car is like and Mollie and James finally fall in love; It's a pretty good movie. John Travolta and Kirstie Alley are good. Olympia Dukakis, Abe Vigoda and George Segal are here too! That is Bruce Willis doing the voice of Mikey! The original cast would return to do Look Who's Talking Too! Then they did Look Who's Talking Now where Mikey has grown up to the stage where he can talk on his own but it's the dogs that talk in that one.

I found the film in a movie bin and decided to check it out to see if I still liked it as an adult and I do. But now that I'm older, I realize how mature those opening scenes were that went totally over my head as a kid. And they're gross. I was eating at the beginning but stopped until after the kid was born.I like Kirstie Alley. I love John Travolta. They were a great combo together in this film. Although it's a little odd to see a mother dancing extra sexy and swiveling her butt in front of the refrigerator for her kid, it is entertainment. I liked watching the two dance together, and got quite the kick out of hearing Bruce Willis as Mikey's voice as a baby.It did seem like Mikey grew up on fast forward. I blinked and the boy had teeth. It was also quite strange that Kirstie's character Mollie was so easygoing about having someone else's mail go to her house and a crazy taxi driver (John Travolta's character James) as the babysitter. That relationship went into fast forward, too.

Kirstie Alley and John Travolta give great performances, and so does the rest of the cast. Bruce Willis is the voice of Mickey.This is a great family film, but the PG-13 rating is there for a reason. It contains scenes of sensuality, and some adult language. Oh, and, if you do decide to let your kids watch this one, be ready to answer their questions about the sperm/egg opening sequence.
