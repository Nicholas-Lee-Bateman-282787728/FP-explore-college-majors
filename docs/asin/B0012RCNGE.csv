1139186,AT57B36BHDQ00,B0012RCNGE,Big Mike,"[13, 15]","I first saw this film at a drive-in theatre in Georgia in 1979. The original pre-release title was to be ""Super Duper Service Station"". I also owned the VHS video release at one time. I never thought it would finally ever be released on DVD!! It stars Kirsten (not Kristen as it says on the front cover of the DVD's sleeve!!) Baker who was later seen as ""Terri"", one of the short-lived summer camp counselors in ""Friday the 13th Part 2"". It co-stars three old familiar faces, Huntz Hall of ""The Bowery Boys"", Joe E. Ross from t.v.'s ""Car 54 Where Are You?"" and Mike Mazurki. The film is fun and pleasant to watch. If you love the old drive-in exploitation films, then I can highly recommend ""Gas Pump Girls"". Three stars for the film but I am afraid only one for the quality of the DVD transfer. Could and should have been much better.

When you get to the climax of the film you'll know what I'm referring to.  There was one part of this film where two guys from Mr. Friendly's tried to stop the girls and the part with them getting hit over the head with the bars of wood, the wood bars looked really fake.  This film has been fully restored and looks brand new, and is the complete version this time.  Wherever John Bloom is now, you can be sure he bought himself a copy of this new MGM Limited Release.  No annoying commercials, no annoying promos, no 15 minutes of new release trailers.  This film does come with the original vintage movie trailer which I thought was great and had me laughing.  I can't give this a perfect five stars because it's a burn-on-demand dvd.  But this time, I got a good copy.  I had problems when I previously bought Scalps and Waterpower on Amazon's DVDr bootlegs, those ones were bad copies and I ended up having to buy them a second time through the Marketplace and got lucky finding two sellers selling the original authentic dvds.  When I bought Burn, Witch, Burn, that one turned out to be a very good copy.  Now I'm wondering about Mardi Gras Massacre, which was an older purchase from two years ago.  It was advertised as an authentic DVD, but in distribution turned out to be a dvdr.  I'm not too happy about that, because I want the complete video nasties list all released on U.S. or region free dvds.

1139196,A1RHM4JTUYXKSG,B0012RCNGE,"Michael Noga ""Jumping kings and making Haste ...","[15, 18]","I know in the IMDB this movie is listed with a release year of 1979 but plenty of the jokes are from the early 20th century. The story and dialogue read like the producers hired some dirty old men who had once possibly worked in a vaudeville theater, possibly as janitors, to expand a porn script into a full length feature film suitable for drive-in theaters. Seriously, many of the jokes sound like something your creepy Grandpa Joe would tell down t the VFW post when Joey Heatherton would pop in on the Merv Griffin Show.That might explain why there are so many dirty old men in the beginning of this movie. In one scene, during a high school graduation ceremony, a bunch of girls have their gowns torn off as part of a prank, revealing their Good & Plenty's. All the guys in the audience start hooting and hollering, even the old dudes. This means that even if they weren't hooting at their topless daughters, they were still hooting at their topless daughters topless best friends, which is still Creep-O-Rama. What would you say to them the next time they dropped by the house for dinner? And Huntz Hall, who plays Kirsten baker's Uncle Joe, looks straight down her top when she comes to his gas station dressed in her prom night finest. Maybe he was checking for melanoma.Anyway, the movie is about a gas station run by the aforementioned Huntz Hall, which is going out of business because of a shiny big new gas station, which opens across the street. Huntz has a heart attack and Kirsten and her friends decide to take over running the station in order to keep it from closing. They decide they can beat the new station with all its amenities by sexyin' up their joint. If the story were any thinner you could serve it at McDonalds between two buns and a pickle.But you know what? The darn movie grows on you. The jokes eventually become more charming in a corny way. For example, after Uncle Joe's heart attack, his doctor walks away from Uncle Joe's sick bed shaking his head. As he approaches the family, still shaking his head vigorously from side to side, they grow anxious and one of them blurts out,"" Doctor, what's wrong?"" The doctor massages the back of his neck with his hand and says, "" My neck, I've had a terrible crick in it for almost a week"".The girls aren't hard on the eyes either. There's Kirsten baker, straight from Norway, who plays the cute girl next door, June, Sandy Johnson, a former Playmate, who plays April, the good natured, curvaceous ditz, Linda Lawrence, who plays the girl who's been around the block more times than the neighborhood dog walker, and Leslie King, who plays the brainy nerd who blossoms under the loving wing of a motorcycle gang member named Peewee.That gang is something special. They're a lot less like Hunter Thompson's version of Hell's Angels and more like the bad kids from Grease. While they wear leather jackets, tool around on bad looking choppers and even smoke, the absolute worst thing they do is...litter. Yup they knock over a garbage can, and it's not even a full garbage can at that. After they push it over one piece of crumpled up paper rolls out. However, the Vultures do have the Vulture salute, and their leader is soap opera heartthrob Steve bond, whose hair is the only thing more indestructible than his ego.To bottom line it for you, this movie has a few laughs, a few dirty jokes, a bit of naive 70's charm and a little topless nudity. It's probably best enjoyed chillin' with some villains and your beverage of choice as amateur MSTK3 fodder. Conversely it's also a soothing balm for when you're lying on the couch recovering from a night on the town. It's pleasant and undemanding yet just stimulating enough to help keep your heart beating.",3,Giggles and Jiggles from the 1970's.,1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,3729,"['know', 'IMDB', 'movie', 'listed', 'release', 'year', '1979', 'plenty', 'jokes', 'are', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'story', 'dialogue', 'read', 'producers', 'hired', 'dirty', 'old', 'men', 'who', 'had', 'once', 'possibly', 'worked', 'vaudeville', 'theater', 'possibly', 'janitors', 'expand', 'porn', 'script', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'film', 'suitable', 'drive-in', 'theaters', 'Seriously', 'many', 'jokes', 'sound', 'something', 'creepy', 'Grandpa', 'Joe', 'would', 'tell', 'down', 't', 'VFW', 'post', 'when', 'Joey', 'Heatherton', 'would', 'pop', 'Merv', 'Griffin', 'Show.That', 'might', 'explain', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'dirty', 'old', 'men', 'beginning', 'movie', 'one', 'scene', 'high', 'school', 'graduation', 'ceremony', 'bunch', 'girls', 'have', 'gowns', 'torn', 'off', 'part', 'prank', 'revealing', 'Good', 'Plenty', 'guys', 'audience', 'start', 'hooting', 'hollering', 'even', 'old', 'dudes', 'even', 'were', ""n't"", 'hooting', 'topless', 'daughters', 'were', 'still', 'hooting', 'topless', 'daughters', 'topless', 'best', 'friends', 'still', 'Creep-O-Rama', 'What', 'would', 'say', 'next', 'time', 'dropped', 'house', 'dinner', 'Huntz', 'Hall', 'who', 'Kirsten', 'baker', 'Uncle', 'Joe', 'straight', 'down', 'top', 'when', 'gas', 'station', 'dressed', 'prom', 'night', 'finest', 'Maybe', 'was', 'checking', 'melanoma.Anyway', 'movie', 'gas', 'station', 'run', 'aforementioned', 'Huntz', 'Hall', 'going', 'business', 'shiny', 'big', 'new', 'gas', 'station', 'street', 'Huntz', 'heart', 'attack', 'Kirsten', 'friends', 'decide', 'take', 'over', 'running', 'station', 'order', 'keep', 'closing', 'decide', 'can', 'beat', 'new', 'station', 'amenities', 'sexyin', 'up', 'joint', 'story', 'were', 'thinner', 'could', 'serve', 'McDonalds', 'two', 'buns', 'pickle.But', 'know', 'what', 'darn', 'movie', 'jokes', 'eventually', 'become', 'more', 'charming', 'corny', 'way', 'example', 'Uncle', 'Joe', 'heart', 'attack', 'doctor', 'away', 'Uncle', 'Joe', 'sick', 'bed', 'shaking', 'head', 'family', 'still', 'shaking', 'head', 'vigorously', 'side', 'side', 'grow', 'anxious', 'one', 'out', 'Doctor', 'what', 'wrong', 'doctor', 'back', 'neck', 'hand', 'neck', ""'ve"", 'had', 'terrible', 'crick', 'almost', 'week', '.The', 'girls', 'are', ""n't"", 'hard', 'eyes', 'either', 'Kirsten', 'baker', 'straight', 'Norway', 'who', 'cute', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'June', 'Sandy', 'Johnson', 'former', 'Playmate', 'who', 'April', 'good', 'natured', 'curvaceous', 'ditz', 'Linda', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'block', 'more', 'times', 'neighborhood', 'dog', 'walker', 'Leslie', 'King', 'who', 'brainy', 'nerd', 'who', 'loving', 'wing', 'motorcycle', 'gang', 'member', 'named', 'Peewee.That', 'gang', 'something', 'special', ""'re"", 'lot', 'less', 'Hunter', 'Thompson', 'version', 'Hell', 'Angels', 'more', 'bad', 'kids', 'Grease', 'wear', 'leather', 'jackets', 'tool', 'around', 'bad', 'looking', 'choppers', 'even', 'smoke', 'absolute', 'worst', 'thing', 'do', 'litter', 'knock', 'garbage', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'full', 'garbage', 'can', 'push', 'one', 'piece', 'crumpled', 'up', 'paper', 'rolls', 'out', 'However', 'Vultures', 'do', 'have', 'Vulture', 'salute', 'leader', 'soap', 'opera', 'heartthrob', 'Steve', 'bond', 'hair', 'only', 'thing', 'more', 'indestructible', 'ego.To', 'bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'few', 'laughs', 'few', 'dirty', 'jokes', 'bit', 'naive', '70', 'charm', 'little', 'topless', 'nudity', 'probably', 'best', 'enjoyed', 'chillin', 'villains', 'beverage', 'choice', 'amateur', 'MSTK3', 'fodder', 'Conversely', 'also', 'soothing', 'balm', 'when', ""'re"", 'lying', 'couch', 'recovering', 'night', 'town', 'pleasant', 'undemanding', 'yet', 'just', 'stimulating', 'enough', 'help', 'keep', 'heart', 'beating']",Gas Pump Girls

Ross, and Mike Mazurki, on the scene (and a nice flowing ""narrative"" by famous New York Dee-Jay Cousin Bruce Morrow, in his ""A.M.""/ ""Cousin Brucie"" mode), a lot more could have been done.The director and writer try to blend 1959 with 1979 and it really does not work.

They all get together when challenged by the neighboring Gas Station, owned by a decidedly unscrupulous guy, who manages to constantly screw a nice old guy, Huntz Hall, uncle of Kristen Baker. She takes over his job when he can't take the pressure any more.Kristen recalls that at the Graduation, a prankster tore up the robes of some of the girls and ...the Graduation finale was a strip show!  So why not get that kind of attention...from old and new patrons?A lot of songs, but 3-4 are pretty good...but there are too many. If a couple had been cut, we would have a tighter, better film. We get Brando-looking bikers disco-ing with Cheryl Tiegs-looking station attendants and we keep hoping for that one stretch which can make us say, ""cult film"". Sadly, it just falls short.Filmed in Orange County, California, we don't get much of that atmosphere.Having said all that, this picture may not have cohesiveness, but it has alot of heart. Kristen is very appealing; other good performances are by Ken Lerner (as ""Vulture"" PeeWee) and Leslie King as ""[Plain] Jane"".
