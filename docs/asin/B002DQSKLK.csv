A person born before 1970 will probably love this as the jokes are dated.  Some of the video on DVD 2 is grainy and DVD 1 alone would give it 5 stars.

He yelled at the audience as though they were merely buddies sharing a wild, drunken party with him.  This disc contains his great routines &#34;Breaking All The Rules&#34; (1987); &#34;Outlaws of Comedy&#34; (1990); &#34;Family Entertainment Hour&#34; (1991) -- and it's definitely NOT family material! -; &#34;Sam Kinison Live in Las Vegas&#34; (1991), and &#34;Brother Sam: A Tribute&#34; (1993.)  He loves to talk about sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll, so leave the kids with a sitter!  It's the perfect DVD for a snowy weekend trapped at home when your kids are staying with friends.  OR, if you WERE a little kid during his TV performances and were not allowed to see this, you are now old enough!  Enjoy!  There is also dress rehearsal footage, just as funny, and a photo slide show.  His comedy is bawdy, mostly timeless, and was way ahead of his time.
