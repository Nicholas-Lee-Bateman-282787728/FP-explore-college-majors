293304,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6302041066,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 4]","Simply put, the Applegates are your typical nuclear family who wants nothing more than to nuke the human race.  Seems simple enough for a group of cockroaches from the bowels of the Amazon forest, but, alas, nothing is simple when Ed Begley Jr, Stockard Channing, and Dabney Coleman round out a cast that discovers being human is more difficult than imagined.  ""The Applegates"" was clever, funny, intelligent, poignant, and surprisingly shocking.  From the beginning, with a group of volunteers trying to teach natives over the rumble of urban sprawl in the Amazon, to the very fun ending that makes you want to clap your hands and jump in excess, ""The Applegates"" represented an old style of cinema that is deeply missed in modern theaters.  With a calling card that screams part ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and part the camp classic ""Amazon Women and the Avocado Jungle of Death"", it engulfs our social problems, our common idiosyncratic ways, and our hidden flaws with a pizzazz that cannot be found in today's films.  ""The Applegates"" boasts an amazing, if not obscure, cast, a powerful blend of humor with satire, and the most crucial element that is missed today - FUN.  One small three letter word that seems to evade comedy's of today.  From the beginning, I was hooked on this film, laughed for the first time in a while, and watched as the Applegates transformed, literally, from bug to human slime.""The Applegates"" can easily be considered a cult classic for three obvious reasons; a strong cast, a powerful story, and moments that will remain in the chambers of your brain.  To begin, the cast is amazing.  Director Michael Lehmann,, who also directed a personal favorite film called ""Heathers"", knows how to make a socially viable comedy that doesn't feel dated or tired.  Watch ""Heathers"" again after watching ""Fight Club"", and you will see the possible similarities between two films made two decades apart.  He made this film using strong actors that typically would never be paired together at all.  Who would have imaged I would be sitting here, typing on the computer, indicating to you that I deeply enjoyed a film starring Ed Begley Jr. and Stockard Channing - or even the fact that Dabney Coleman was mixed in there as well?!?  This is a first for me.  ""The Applegates"" worked because the cast wasn't fighting from within.  They were working together to create comedy (yet again another concept that seems to escape modern cinematic farces), they played off of each other, building their small character into something believable and witty for the greater good - the movie!  It was impressive to watch them implode together, but it was equally as fun to see them outside of their element on their own.  Begley was dry and perfect for his role as the master-in-command bug, while Channing went through this amazing transformation from modest housewife to spending madman.  The same can be said for the two children, which go from bright and sunny to dark and sadistic midway through the film.  The human elements that invade these bugs' lives are over-developed for this film, but they work impressively well.  These Applegates, as well as the actors that portray them, prove to humans that even if they come to us, we will still destroy their sense of what is right or wrong.""The Applegates"" used a powerful technique for keeping this film easy on the eyes.  It used the K.I.S.S. method that I believe helps comedies reach a higher level of repeated viewings.  The ""Keep It Simple Stupid"" was applied to this film by merely saying that these bugs were going to nuke a small town in the United States.  There wasn't a fear of technology, over-analyzing, or future consequences - and with a film like this, we didn't need it.  I wanted to laugh, bring in thoughts of what is destroying our world, and see a film that was fresh and genuine; and I was able to see it with ""The Applegates"".  The story was superb.  It was funny and poignant all at the same time.  The cast, which I have already applauded, makes this story come to life and seem more emotional than your typical big-budget cast with over-hyped budget.  This was a simple story, and due to the simplicity of the tale, my attention was focused and this film was enjoyed.  Where else could you not question Dabney Coleman dressed as ""Aunt Bea""?Finally, the message that Lehmann was trying to release was clear.  There are problems in the United States whether we would want to blame them on outside influences or not, we have issues with underage pregnancies, drug use, over-spending, and adultery (perhaps every country does - but we seem to engulf it further).  This film exploits them on a group of bugs that gain our sympathies and force us to root for them when they are down.  Comedy is the tool used to show us our flaws, but our laughter is not ""HA HA HA"", but more of a ""ha"" as we consider our own lives within these bugs.  Metaphors abound, we feel sad for these Applegates as they begin to falter in their mission because we are causing the failure.  Our obese lifestyles are killing these bugs, and Lehmann isn't afraid to show us that to our face.Overall, I thought ""The Applegates"" was yet another strong film released by Michael Lehmann.  It was sharp, witty, intelligent, and hysterical as this group of bugs learns what it is like to truly be human.  It is a sad story of our human lives, wondering if others would ever watch this film and see us in such a light, one can only wonder.  It is a passionate story, with a cast that will truly surprise you and make you question your own choices in life.  While it was released during a time where there was heightened fear of the destruction of the Amazon forests, while we battle today with the issue of Global Warming - the two seem to pair well - like a glass of white wine with a chicken salad.  ""The Applegates"" remains a poignant film, and I hope that it will one day see the light of DVD.  It needs to be seen by more, as we laugh, these issues need to be addressed.  HA.  Dabney Coleman dressed as ""Aunt Bea"".  HA!  I can't seem to get that out of my mind!Grade: ***** out of *****",5,They are a modern stone-age family ... or is it modern age?,1200528000,"01 17, 2008",2008,6138,"['Simply', 'put', 'Applegates',

Their mission is simple, blow up the power plant so they can rid the world of humans and so that they can live free once again in their true bug form.Comparisons between this film and director Lehmann's previous effort, Heathers, are unavoidable since both films are satires on American culture. Unlike Heathers, Meet the Applegates lacks the tenacity to take direct aim at its subject.There's a joke about how the queen bug follows the Applegates to Ohio disguised as Dabney Coleman, unaware that American women don't look nothing like Dabney Coleman. Initially seeing Coleman in drag is quite funny, but the joke grows quite tired, quite quick. It's a one note idea that is repeated over and over again and that pretty much surmises Meet the Applegates. Once the film is able to gets its point across, it is just left to repeat itself over and over again.It's easy to understand why Meet the Applegates has become a minor cult classic. It's also easy to understand why the film would be a curio for some due to the fact that the main characters are giant insects disguised as humans. Oddly enough, I found myself entertained for most of its running time, though longing for something more.Meet the Applegates delves into excess. Dad commits adultery. Mom becomes addicted to credit cards and materialism. Their daughter is date raped by a jock and becomes pregnant and their son dives head first into drugs & rock n' roll. The film is too low key, too laid back and too reserved in its overall approach. If you're going to make an outrageous satire involving giant bugs, you have to have the balls (so to speak) to follow through and attack the subject matter at hand.Heathers had a certain ferocious, unrestrained quality to it. Heathers not only made you laugh, but it stung. In the process, it made you think. It challenged you and made you look within yourself. In an attempt to offend no one, Meet the Applegates is a diverting romp, nothing more. [R] 90 mins.Filmed in 1989.
