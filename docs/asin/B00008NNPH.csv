Juliette Lewis has a boring part but still she makes it look interesting. The mother character (whoops whats her name?) Is really good too. The story is of two women trying to find love in bars in New Jersey, set in the 80s. Uma is really screwed in the head and has a habit of hurting those who care about her. Shes really high strung.

745592,A3ATTCCO32ZXET,B00008NNPH,"A. Ryan ""Merribelle""","[6, 7]","There will always be females who can't be alone. We've all known at least one of them.  They're the ones who sit at the bar night after night hoping that this time, Mr. Right will walk in and make all their dreams come true.  Hysterical Blindness is a movie about two lifelong friends who are so oblivious to what's really going on around them that they became that clich&eacute;.Uma Thurman and Juliette Lewis are consummate actresses.  Perhaps that's why this film was so painful to watch - they both did very well portraying twentysomethings with little self respect. Debbie's (Uma) father left her and her mom when she was 13; her motives for bar slumming are classic, obvious, and sad.  Beth (Juliette) has a daughter whom she leaves at home alone to go bar hopping with Debbie nearly every night. They repeatedly trade their dignity and their sexuality for that very temporary illusion of closeness with a guy (aka, ""one night stands"").  Neither one of them knows how to not flirt with any eligible male that shows them the slightest interest.As you might expect, this outlook on life leads them into some bleak situations.  Debbie imagines that a guy she meets one night is much more into her than he really is and starts throwing herself at him in a lot of embarrassing stunts to get and keep his attention.  Beth nearly loses her daughter.  There's a very pointed moral to this story about appreciating your friends and loved ones, not looking for something that isn't there and facing reality - all very true in my opinion.What really didn't grab me about Hysterical Blindness was the fact that it was paced so slowly that it seemed to take forever to get around to making its point; meanwhile, I can relate to Debbie all to well on some level, which is a painful thing.  It drags me back to that time in my own life where I was just as insecure in my own way.  Not a nice place to revisit, even if honest.  And I was bored even then.So, if you're really into Uma and Juliette, this is a brilliant showcasing of their talents.  Otherwise, I'd skip Hysterical Blindness in favor of any of the more upbeat chick flicks like 13 Going on 30.Andrea, aka Merribelle",3,Honest look at desperate young women,1118448000,"06 11, 2005",2005,2169,"['will', 'always', 'be', 'females', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'alone', ""'ve"", 'known', 'least', 'one', ""'re"", 'ones', 'who', 'sit', 'bar', 'night', 'night', 'hoping', 'time', 'Mr', 'Right', 'will', 'walk', 'make', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'Hysterical', 'Blindness', 'movie', 'two', 'lifelong', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'oblivious', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'became', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Thurman', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'are', 'consummate', 'actresses', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'painful', 'watch', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'portraying', 'twentysomethings', 'little', 'self', 'respect', 'Debbie', 'Uma', 'father', 'left', 'mom', 'when', 'was', '13', 'motives', 'bar', 'slumming', 'are', 'classic', 'obvious', 'sad', 'Beth', 'Juliette', 'daughter', 'whom', 'home', 'alone', 'go', 'bar', 'hopping', 'Debbie', 'nearly', 'night', 'repeatedly', 'trade', 'dignity', 'sexuality', 'very', 'temporary', 'illusion', 'closeness', 'guy', 'aka', 'one', 'night', 'stands', 'one', 'how', 'not', 'flirt', 'eligible', 'male', 'slightest', 'interest.As', 'might', 'expect', 'outlook', 'life', 'bleak', 'situations', 'Debbie', 'guy', 'one', 'night', 'much', 'more', 'really', 'throwing', 'lot', 'embarrassing', 'stunts', 'get', 'keep', 'attention', 'Beth', 'nearly', 'daughter', 'very', 'pointed', 'moral', 'story', 'appreciating', 'friends', 'loved', 'ones', 'not', 'looking', 'something', ""n't"", 'facing', 'reality', 'very', 'true', 'opinion.What', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'grab', 'Hysterical', 'Blindness', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'paced', 'so', 'slowly', 'seemed', 'take', 'forever', 'get', 'making', 'point', 'meanwhile', 'can', 'relate', 'Debbie', 'well', 'level', 'painful', 'thing', 'back', 'time', 'own', 'life', 'where', 'was', 'just', 'insecure', 'own', 'way', 'Not', 'nice', 'place', 'revisit', 'even', 'honest', 'was', 'bored', 'even', 'then.So', ""'re"", 'really', 'Uma', 'Juliette', 'brilliant', 'showcasing', 'talents', 'Otherwise', ""'d"", 'skip', 'Hysterical', 'Blindness', 'favor', 'more', 'upbeat', 'chick', 'flicks', '13', 'Going', '30.Andrea', 'aka', 'Merribelle']",Hysterical Blindness

At times cringingly reminiscent of my own mistakes in my youth, but an extraodinary script and the most amazing acting story.It is about two women, 'pushing thirty' as it says in the blurb above. The difference here is that they have never grown up into adult relationships, they are searching for something which they think is an adult relationship, but searching in the same places, the bar the have always gone to. The men are all just the same, and everything is towards a casual one night stand.It is set in the mid 1980's, the hair is Jersey-big, the jeans skinny stretch stove pipes and the accents nasal whines. But Juliette Lewis and Uma thurmas utterly pin their characters down. They are helped along but an extraodinary script and great direction. The neediness Uma Thurman's character, at once picky and judging, the next whining and needy, and then in another moment, coquettishly naive. I am not normally a fan of Juliette Lewis but she absolutely takes this character, the lost dreamer, and makes it her own. She is almost stifled by her need to help Uma's character, and support her own daughter, that her own life becomes crushed (willingly it seems) beneath everything else.I bought the DVD in the end because I found it so powerful and multilayered that I wanted to see it a few more times and watch the extraodinary relationships and subtle subtexts of the movie.If you want to watch something that really show cases these talents, and yet does it without grandstanding you will enjoy this.

745600,A9HKBYQB4XIEV,B00008NNPH,"""eurotrashgirl""","[6, 9]","Uma Thurman, Juliette Lewis and Gena Rowlands star in this small, constrained indie drama about three womens' lives unfolding in a desparate, bittersweet way.  Thurman and Lewis (playing a single mother) are two circa 30-ish women who frequent their local bar, ""Ollies,"" trolling for love, affection, and men with relationship potential. And boy are they fishing in the wrong sea! But they don't quite realize it, at least not for most of the film. The film's title ""Hysterical Blindness"" is a play on words which reflects the searching mostly in vain of the two young women in the film to find real love in a mostly deserted place, and also a description of an ailment which Thurman's character struggles with: under severe stress, she loses her vision, literally, and becomes 'hysterically blind.' Rowlands plays Thurman's mother, a woman whose husband left her suddenly when Thurman's character was 13, a sad and defining moment in both women's lives, and one which they both have yet to fully come to terms with. Solidly working class, Thurman works in a sewing factory of sorts, and Rowlands' character is a waitress in a diner.When I say that the film is about lives unfolding, that isn't entirely true, because these lives threaten to never really unfold at all. One worries that the lives of these characters will never really take flight or emerge in the way that they could, should, or are supposed to. It's like watching a starting-to-unfurl cocoon, that never really keeps unfurling. These women are stuck, in their habits, their jobs, their way of thinking, their 'place' in life, and though they are beautiful and kind and have things to offer, one gets the feeling that somehow they will likely never get where they should be going, that the greyness and dusty shroudedness of their cocoons will never really fade away or change. Although they *could* go somewhere, maybe not ""far,"" whatever that would be, but at least somewhere new in their lives, somewhere meaningful, in all their colors and glory and vibrant wings, the fact that they don't seem headed in that direction in any significant way that makes it a bit of a downer of a film. As much as the end would like to have you believe it is hopeful, or that the characters have changed to a significant enough degree that their lives will have more meaning and clarity and beauty, the ending is too small and short and ordinary, and it hasn't been properly built up to enough to really get where it needs to, or is trying to, or seems to think it is going.As typical indie fare, the film has a character-driven plot (though really there isn't much of a plot, over-all), with some symbolism strewn in here and there, and some definite emotive moments. But the film doesn't add up to much really, in its scope or storyline or message. What really shines here I guess is the acting. Both Juliette Lewis and Uma Thurman truly inhabit their characters and, especially in the case of Thurman's character, really convey her sense of desparation and loneliness, her utter need and unhappiness.I recommend it as a look at some really amazing acting, but not for too many other reasons. There are just too many other indie films that are better or more well-rounded or have a greater scope. All that being said, I'm glad I saw it, and the idea of being 'hysterically blind' due to the utter desparate notion of relying entirely on others, specifically men (if you are a woman) for your happiness, and how much of a mistake that is, does come through loud and clear. And it was nice to see two beautiful and elegant Hollywood actresses really going no-holds barred in portraying somewhat hopeless, hapless and not very intelligent characters (not to mention entirely unglamorous.. though Thurman is beautiful despite herself here.. it just makes you wish she Knew how much she had to offer, and how little sense it made for her to act as desparate as she did in this film. At least one gets the sense that as the film went on, she was starting to get the idea, which made it bearable.) Gena Rowlands, in her role as Thurman's mother, also does well, but not spectacularly.

After viewing the delightful ""Monsoon Wedding"", I have taken an interest in Ms. Nair's talent, and ""Hysterical Blindness"" expertly captures the character of its environs. This movie is to New Jersey what ""Fargo"" was to Minnesota. (Yes I know that Fargo is in North Dakota, but who wants to call a movie ""Brainerd""? Or ""Bayonne"", for that matter?)""Hysterical Blindness"" features spot-on acting by the cast, portraying lost and lonely characters. Uma Thurman captures the high-strung and neurotic Debbie with an inspiring performance. Here is a beautiful young woman whose utter cluelessness and total inability to be spontaneous prevent her from making any sort of real connection to anyone. Some of the scenes are truly cringe-inducing, reflecting the sheer desperation of the situation.Perhaps to the reader, this doesn't sound like ""entertainment"", but don't lose me yet. There is much humor in the friendship of Debbie and Beth (Juliette Lewis), and Beth's adolescent daughter. Then there is the sweet love story between Debbie's mother, a waitress, (Gena Rowlands) and one of her customers at the diner (Ben Gazzara). The couple's grace at falling in love contrasts starkly to Debbie's attempts to force it, making it all the more painful.After viewing the movie on DVD, I immediately watched it again in the version which includes Ms. Nair's commentary, which further cemented my respect for her and that of the players of this performance. If we are honest with ourselves, it will be easy to empathize with these characters, even as we may think we are laughing at them.

Borrowing from Jacqueline Carey, you can't find love where it isn't and you can't hide love where it is, this film tells a story of a pathetic woman who just doesn't see too clearly. She has bouts of blindness and the doctor has told her it is caused by stress.  She is absolutely desperate, completely so, and so blind to her own circumstances that it takes a bartender to tell her that she ""don't see things to good"".  She's just pitiful throwing herself at, what her dumb friend can plainly see, is a mean guy, just because he has ""Patrick Swayze eyes"".  She throw's it all out in front of him, making a total and complete jerk of herself, and he uses her and proceeds to  get rid of her right away and she's so wild with desperation that she actually thinks there is something there.Debby's proud of her special parking spot by the bar, like that makes her special.  She's proud of her Camaro, like that makes her special.  She pulls out all the stops to get what she needs, but the problem is, she's grasping like a drowning person. EVERYONE CAN SEE IT!  BUT HER!  SHE'S HYSTERICALLY BLIND!  Uma does such a fine, painful job of portraying this character, that it just makes you ache for her.  I wanted to have a talk with her and explain to her what everyone else can plainly see, I wanted to be her friend, and then I remembered this is a movie! I love it when a movie can make me forget I am watching a movie.I found it odd when Ben Gazzara's character told her he could see that she was smart.  She really liked that but she seemed pretty stupid, so I don't know if that line was meant to show that Gazzara's character's kindness or if it meant something deeper, but if it did it was lost on me. Maybe she was a smart woman trapped in an emotionally blind woman's body.  Another thing I wondered was the bridge in the background.  I looms over the characters like a dark cage trapping them all into this dismal existance, at the same time being the only way out.Some people found this movie humorous but I didn't find it funny at all.  I thought itwas dark and painful but the honesty of it simply overwhelmed me.  Uma and Juliette, two of my favorites, deliver powerful performances.  If it was a budget movie, they certainly didn't waste their money on stars.  Gena Rowlands may have been a little too classy for the role, if there was any problems at all with casting. I think she had a hard time bringing it down, which I know Gena can do because I've seen her do it in other films.  Her clothes were a little too expensive looking  to represent most old waitresses I have known, but that isn't her fault, is it?This is a great movie if you're interested in serious acting talent.",5,Thurman knocks it out of the park.,1148515200,"05 25, 2006",2006,2741,"['Debby', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'good', 'advice', 'Borrowing', 'Jacqueline', 'Carey', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'love', 'where', ""n't"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'hide', 'love', 'where', 'film', 'story', 'pathetic', 'woman', 'who', 'just', ""n't"", 'see', 'too', 'clearly', 'bouts', 'blindness', 'doctor', 'told', 'caused', 'stress', 'absolutely', 'desperate', 'completely', 'so', 'so', 'blind', 'own', 'circumstances', 'bartender', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'things', 'good', 'just', 'pitiful', 'throwing', 'what', 'dumb', 'friend', 'can', 'plainly', 'see', 'mean', 'guy', 'just', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'eyes', 'throw', 'out', 'front', 'making', 'total', 'complete', 'jerk', 'herself', 'proceeds', 'get', 'rid', 'right', 'away', 'so', 'wild', 'desperation', 'actually', 'something', 'there.Debby', 'proud', 'special', 'parking', 'spot', 'bar', 'special', 'proud', 'Camaro', 'special', 'out', 'stops', 'get', 'what', 'problem', 'grasping', 'drowning', 'person', 'EVERYONE', 'CAN', 'SEE', 'IT', 'BUT', 'HER', 'SHE', 'HYSTERICALLY', 'BLIND', 'Uma', 'fine', 'painful', 'job', 'portraying', 'character', 'just', 'ache', 'wanted', 'have', 'talk', 'explain', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'can', 'plainly', 'see', 'wanted', 'be', 'friend', 'then', 'remembered', 'movie', 'love', 'when', 'movie', 'can', 'make', 'forget', 'am', 'watching', 'movie.I', 'found', 'odd', 'when', 'Ben', 'Gazzara', 'character', 'told', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'smart', 'really', 'liked', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'line', 'was', 'meant', 'show', 'Gazzara', 'character', 'kindness', 'meant', 'something', 'deeper', 'did', 'was', 'lost', 'Maybe', 'was', 'smart', 'woman', 'trapped', 'emotionally', 'blind', 'woman', 'body', 'thing', 'wondered', 'was', 'bridge', 'background', 'looms', 'characters', 'dark', 'cage', 'trapping', 'dismal', 'existance', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'only', 'way', 'out.Some', 'people', 'found', 'movie', 'humorous', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'funny', 'thought', 'itwas', 'dark', 'painful', 'honesty', 'simply', 'overwhelmed', 'Uma', 'Juliette', 'two', 'favorites', 'deliver', 'powerful', 'performances', 'was', 'budget', 'movie', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'stars', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'too', 'classy', 'role', 'was', 'problems', 'casting', 'think', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'bringing', 'down', 'know', 'Gena', 'can', 'do', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', 'other', 'films', 'clothes', 'were', 'little', 'too', 'expensive', 'looking', 'represent', 'most', 'old', 'waitresses', 'have', 'known', ""n't"", 'fault', 'great', 'movie', ""'re"", 'interested', 'serious', 'acting', 'talent']",Hysterical Blindness

Uma Thurman gives it up, not the glamour girl we're used too, but a thirty something bar fly unable to land a man.  It's not that she's unattractive, this is Uma we're talking about, but she is socially retarded because her daddy ran out on the family.  Consequently, she hits all the wrong notes in interaction with the local Jersey Guys.  The stress has caused symptoms, hysterical blindness, as her tone-deaf social antics at the local nightspot resemble the antics of immature high school girls.  Her friend, beautifully played by Juliette Lewis is just a little bit smarter, but not much.  They dream about being really hot when they were sixteen.  Lewis' grade school daughter, April Autumn is crying out for a responsible mother.  Meanwhile, Ben Gazarra, still suave after all these years, is romancing Uma's mom, Gina Rowlands.

We meet two young women who are life long friends.  One has a child by her first love, while the other one has never been married or had a meaningful relationship.  Both are desperate to find love, get married and have a real family.  The problem is that they are trying too hard and they are going to the wrong places such as ""Ollie's Bar"" where guys care only for one night stand, not for a commitment.  As film is progressing, we learn that they are really searching for their fathers since that seems to be the common thread for all of them.  They have fathers who have abandoned families when these women were young teenagers and that experience has definitely left an emotional mark on them.  The mother-daughter relationships are also complicated and director is not afraid to explore that side too.
