It seems to me that Roswell was trying to capitalize off the success of Dawson's Creek. Except this teen drama had a sci-fi twist. All in all this show was not half bad. It had it's hokey moment's and it had it's triumphs. Lead actress Shiri Appleby looked remarkably similar to Katie Holmes and the gorgeous Katherine Heigl used her looks and sex appeal often during the show just as Michelle Williams (Jenn Lindley) did in Dawson's Creek. The stand out performer in the show was William Sadler (Sheriff Valenti) which would not come as a surprise to anyone familiar with this actor and his work. The show takes some bizarre twists and ends up backing up on its self a time or two but was surprisingly entertaining. The complete three seasons is a bit of a wild roller coaster ride with quite a few surprises surprisingly. So you get the attractive cast with  Majandra Delfino who went from ugly and homely to knockout status in a span of a summer and the gorgeous Emilie de Ravin in her ""Pre-Lost"" days and the equally attractive male cast who actually did a fairly good job of acting. However this show was doomed from the beginning as the network and the creator/producers of the show could never agree which direction to take the show. This made for some fairly absurd story lines and abrupt endings to interesting story lines. This show was not sure what it wanted to be. But yet...it is a bit of a guilty pleasure in it's own right. The first season was the best and the show was fair to decent from then on with a bit of a disappointing series finale.",3,A fair to decent show.,1217721600,"08 3, 2008",2008,1683,"['Allot', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'teen', 'drama', 'have', 'ruled', 'airwaves', 'years', 'now', 'here', 'take', 'teen', 'drama', 'Roswell', 'was', 'trying', 'capitalize', 'off', 'success', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'teen', 'drama', 'had', 'sci-fi', 'twist', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'half', 'bad', 'had', 'hokey', 'moment', 'had', 'triumphs', 'Lead', 'actress', 'Shiri', 'Appleby', 'looked', 'remarkably', 'similar', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'gorgeous', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'used', 'looks', 'sex', 'appeal', 'often', 'show', 'just', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Jenn', 'Lindley', 'did', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'stand', 'out', 'performer', 'show', 'was', 'William', 'Sadler', 'Sheriff', 'Valenti', 'would', 'not', 'come', 'surprise', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'actor', 'work', 'show', 'bizarre', 'twists', 'up', 'backing', 'up', 'self', 'time', 'two', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'complete', 'three', 'seasons', 'bit', 'wild', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'few', 'surprises', 'surprisingly', 'get', 'attractive', 'cast', 'Majandra', 'Delfino', 'who', 'went', 'ugly', 'homely', 'knockout', 'status', 'span', 'summer', 'gorgeous', 'Emilie', 'de', 'Ravin', 'Pre-Lost', 'days', 'equally', 'attractive', 'male', 'cast', 'who', 'actually', 'did', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'However', 'show', 'was', 'doomed', 'beginning', 'network', 'creator/producers', 'show', 'could', 'never', 'agree', 'direction', 'take', 'show', 'made', 'fairly', 'absurd', 'story', 'lines', 'abrupt', 'endings', 'interesting', 'story', 'lines', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'yet', 'bit', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'own', 'right', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'best', 'show', 'was', 'fair', 'decent', 'then', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'series', 'finale']",N/A
1026831,A19NUGLBFY4JV0,B000JJ6K0Q,David G,"[0, 0]","Since I am watching the Roswell Series again I figured that I would write a review on it. The basic show is about 3 and sometimes more alien/human hybrids living among society today (well at least the year 2000), they are adopted and as they say &#34;hide in plain sight&#34; until there secret is known to a few of their High School Circle.This show does have some flaws but the chemistry between all the actors is fantastic, they really did a good job casting and that is what makes the show work for me. Stars include young Katherine Heigl, Jason Behr, Brendan Fehr, Shiri Appleby, Nick Weschler, and Colin Hanks. The veteran actor of the show is William Sadler who plays Sheriff Valenti and is my favorite actor and character's in the show. Guest, Co-Star, and re-appearing actors are Jonathan Frakes (Star Trek TNG), David Conrad (Ghost Whisper), Emile De Raven and Terry O'Quinn from Lost, and Gretchen Egolf.The Lead Alien is Max who is involved with Liz and their romance is the constant storyline of the series, the show incorporates all the elements of High School Love, real world situations, and of course the Sci-Fi element which is strong in some episodes and kept to a minimal in others. If you are a fan of The X-Files, Supernatural, and other &#34;deep&#34; Sci-Fi then you would most likely enjoy this. The intro of the show is catchy and Dido's &#34;Here With Me&#34; is perfectly fitting for the show, there are also some cool  tribute videos on You Tube.The series finale is sudden because of the shows early cancellation and is a real tear jerker. This show does have a cult like following and there is even a movie campaign to make a full length feature that some of the actors have signed on to, that is pretty high on my wish list but not sure it will happen.My favorite three episodes would be Summer of 47, Viva Las Vegas, and Graduation (Series Finale).

I ended up watching the whole series while on vacation and enjoyed every minute of it.  Once it was all over (short-lived; 3 seasons) I was left with a pang in my stomach, wanting more.  There aren't many shows that only last three seasons yet are able to do what Roswell did.  It was filmed around the millennium and is timeless, except for the large clunky cell phones.  There were so many things about this series that were endearing.  Who didn't want to go visit the Crash Down Cafe?  It's only been 8 years since the series ended, but so much has changed in the real world since then.  Roswell has this American small-town nostalgia that's infectious.

1026835,A25RT8ZYKNWY3L,B000JJ6K0Q,Joseph L. Soler II,"[3, 3]","Jason Katims, who has since gone on to more fame with the critically acclaimed Friday Night Lights really began his climb (in my humble opinion) with this well-made and clever tale of the alien babies who crashed in Roswell in 1947 before growing up as teenagers in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This show was cancelled at least three or four times before its final cancellation, before fan campaigns brought it back (the famous Tabasco Hot Sauce campaigns) and the constant shifts in focus, style and format demonstrate the many attempts to grab, well not an audience which it had, but the attention and support of the studio Execs who kept cancelling it. This show launched Katherine Heigl's career though she pretends this show never happened and several other familiar faces made appearances over the years. This show is a very entertaining show, if not a masterpiece, and the contours of storyline and format give a great sense of how challenging it must be to work in television, to structure and conceive an entertaining show. Katims found his footing with this show and demonstrated a clear eye for talent with his casting choices as he has continued to do with Friday Night Lights.

ALL the actors have this amazing chemistry together, you actually start believing the characters and forming this ""bond"" with them even though theyre just characters on a tv show. the first season deals more with max saving Liz's life and this connection & attraction between them, its really mostly about their love story (outcast alien boy with special powers saves crushs life and they fall in love but it comes with a price) the second season (the one i happen to like the most) deals more with the sci-fi aspect and theres alot going on and you really have to pay attention because there are alot of little things that lead up to a crazy season finale and you dont even pay much attention to those details and once they all come together in the season finale you are like ""OMG I CANT BELIEVE I DIDNT SEE THAT!"" there is also a very hugggeeee drift between max & liz and basically the aliens & humans in general all because of a very sad & important moment in the show. you start realizing that not everyone is who you thought they were...someone has a secret that has a HUGE impact on all their lives. third season deals with a bit of both, love & sci-fi and although its not my favorite season (its the one i like the least out of the 3) it is still pretty good. liz and max get a little reckless and hit some road bumps not only in their relationship but between them and their parents... this is the season i really get mad at max's parents, they drive me nuts but in the end it ends up being for the better. an enemy returns unexpectedly, liz has been going through some MAJOR changes and liz and the aliens are being hunted...i really didnt want to get into too much detail because anyone who has seen the show knows all there is to know and those who havnt i dont want to spoil it for you but all in all this is a purchase worth going through with. ive gotten countless friends hooked on this show and had them end up buying all the seasons themselves too! take a chance on a great show with fantastic acting and believable characters. this show will always be one of my top 3 favorite shows of all time (veronica mars & supernatural being the other 2)",5,I'll NEVER get tired of this show!,1228348800,"12 4, 2008",2008,2475,"['ever', 'first', 'aired', 'wb', 'i', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'roswell', 'something', 'just', 'fascinating', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'series', 'are', 'kind', 'slow', 'going', 'really', 'get', 'understand', 'whats', 'going', 'i', 'watched', 'show', 'grow', '3', 'seasons', 'was', 'alive', 'was', 'sad', 'see', 'end', 'actors', 'have', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'together', 'actually', 'start', 'believing', 'characters', 'forming', 'bond', 'even', 'theyre', 'just', 'characters', 'tv', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'deals', 'more', 'max', 'saving', 'Liz', 'life', 'connection', 'attraction', 'really', 'mostly', 'love', 'story', 'outcast', 'alien', 'boy', 'special', 'powers', 'saves', 'crushs', 'life', 'fall', 'love', 'price', 'second', 'season', 'one', 'i', 'happen', 'like', 'most', 'deals', 'more', 'sci-fi', 'aspect', 'theres', 'alot', 'going', 'really', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'are', 'alot', 'little', 'things', 'lead', 'up', 'crazy', 'season', 'finale', 'dont', 'even', 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'details', 'once', 'come', 'together', 'season', 'finale', 'are', 'OMG', 'CANT', 'BELIEVE', 'DIDNT', 'SEE', 'also', 'very', 'hugggeeee', 'drift', 'max', 'liz', 'basically', 'aliens', 'humans', 'general', 'very', 'sad', 'important', 'moment', 'show', 'start', 'realizing', 'not', 'everyone', 'who', 'thought', 'were', 'someone', 'secret', 'HUGE', 'impact', 'lives', 'third', 'season', 'deals', 'bit', 'love', 'sci-fi', 'not', 'favorite', 'season', 'one', 'i', 'least', '3', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'liz', 'max', 'get', 'little', 'reckless', 'hit', 'road', 'not', 'only', 'relationship', 'parents', 'season', 'i', 'really', 'get', 'mad', 'max', 'parents', 'drive', 'nuts', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'better', 'enemy', 'returns', 'unexpectedly', 'liz', 'been', 'going', 'MAJOR', 'changes', 'liz', 'aliens', 'are', 'being', 'hunted', 'i', 'really', 'didnt', 'want', 'get', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'show', 'know', 'who', 'havnt', 'i', 'dont', 'want', 'spoil', 'purchase', 'worth', 'going', 'ive', 'gotten', 'countless', 'friends', 'hooked', 'show', 'had', 'end', 'up', 'buying', 'seasons', 'too', 'take', 'chance', 'great', 'show', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'believable', 'characters', 'show', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'one', 'top', '3', 'favorite', 'shows', 'time', 'veronica', 'mars', 'supernatural', 'being', 'other', '2']",N/A

I can only theorize the glut of somewhat similar type shows at the time must have caused teenage angst series fatigue among the target audience.  There was a show about a creek, another that took place in a rocky mountain town and certainly Buffy.But surprisingly, there still  is a cult following years later and for anyone, the Roswell series is definitely worth a look.  For one thing, the show has feelings and complex relationships, so women should like it, and just enough action adventure to keep men interested.  The science fiction overtones are there but not overbearing.  The show cleans up nicely through its three seasons-  a start to finish of the story, a complete saga.  Many canceled shows are unable to accomplish this, leaving the book half unread, but here there are very few dangling threads.Another, it seemed to bring up some interesting ideas and situations I still think about.  The  sheriff's dad once a man of vigor and strength now  aged and infirm, had oatmeal on his clean shirt and as the result of a fit or something. And earlier, he could not eat his pears without assistance.  The constant rocky relationship that Alien Michael and Human Maria had was a never ending source of amusement--ie Michael gets caught by Maria over something and he sits down and says to her seemly sour puss ""Let me have it,"" resigned to his fate and the storm he expects to come.The alien side of things are definitely emotive and heartfelt yet disquieting and psychopathic.  Note to self, if someone is discovered to be a space alien FEIGN IGNORANCE , --some of those aliens will turn you into dust if deemed too snoopy nosed and the government, if they feel you know too much, will roll your body into a ditch.The last season has a new character introduced to the cast , Jesse, secret love interest of Isabel .  He is not an original character in the book the series is derived from but an addition (as if the series followed the books closely anyway).  It took me  awhile to warm up to him and he may have been an intentionally ironic addition-Hispanic, his people having a at least a stereotypical history current and past of being illegal aliens, in love with a space alien probably as illegal as anything could ever be.  Isabel suddenly marries him.  Unlike her brothers, who tell their sweethearts they are from another planet,  Isabel keeps it a secret from her husband who then begins to get a clue when he randomly gets tossed into unmarked vans by guys in suites and sunglasses and is endlessly interrogated about his wife(an exaggeration, but you get the idea).There are several ways to end a series, among which are to kill everyone or at least half the main cast and  blow everything else up, but to the show creators' credit, neither really occurs.  One of the cast is killed off, but this one was absent most of the 3rd season and was one of the  psychopathic aliens so it was not entirely unexpected nor heartbreaking.  The rest drive off into the sunset in a beat up van leaving some puzzled parents behind.  The Human Husband splits away from the Alien Wife after not a whole lot of convincing to pursue his dream job.  Yes, sex with an alien woman is surprisingly good and transcendentally hallucinogenic, but few things can surpass $350,000 a year in Boston.  I imagine if he is really in love, he will keep track of her and use some of his premium salary to buy the fugitives a better van with air conditioning.5 stars, but I take away one for a somewhat confusing plot arc.  The relationship with Max and Liz drives the series and since this is not dark fiction,  it is expected they have some sort of satisfying happy resolution.  One episode has future Max self saying to  Liz girlfriend she must breakup with past Max self else the planet, galaxy and universe will be overrun by enemy aliens and everyone they know dies horribly.  This is expectantly defeated later on when Liz seems to forget about this and lures Max back  BUT  without a reasonable explanation of why it is safe to do so.",4,If you discover some one is a space alien...,1301356800,"03 29, 2011",2011,4629,"['discover', 'one', 'space', 'alien', 'ROSWELLWARNING', 'spoilers', 'just', 'get', 'series', 'saw', 'streaming', 'keeper', 'DVD', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'DVD', 'seen', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'read', 'useful', 'read', 'Wikipedia', 'other', 'articles', 'series', 'understand', 'drama', 'drama', 'music', 'was', 'dropped', 'original', 'airing', 'get', 'go', 'series', 'faced', 'cancellation', 'ie', 'were', ""n't"", 'package', 'deal', 'well', 'known', 'show', 'obtained', 'network', 'third', 'season', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'can', 'only', 'theorize', 'glut', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'type', 'shows', 'time', 'must', 'have', 'caused', 'teenage', 'angst', 'series', 'fatigue', 'target', 'audience', 'was', 'show', 'creek', 'took', 'place', 'rocky', 'mountain', 'town', 'certainly', 'Buffy.But', 'surprisingly', 'still', 'cult', 'following', 'years', 'later', 'anyone', 'Roswell', 'series', 'definitely', 'worth', 'look', 'one', 'thing', 'show', 'feelings', 'complex', 'relationships', 'women', 'should', 'like', 'just', 'enough', 'action', 'adventure', 'keep', 'men', 'interested', 'science', 'fiction', 'overtones', 'are', 'there', 'not', 'overbearing', 'show', 'up', 'nicely', 'three', 'seasons-', 'start', 'finish', 'story', 'complete', 'saga', 'Many', 'canceled', 'shows', 'are', 'unable', 'accomplish', 'leaving', 'book', 'half', 'unread', 'here', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'dangling', 'threads.Another', 'seemed', 'bring', 'up', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'situations', 'still', 'think', 'sheriff', 'dad', 'once', 'man', 'vigor', 'strength', 'now', 'aged', 'infirm', 'had', 'oatmeal', 'clean', 'shirt', 'result', 'fit', 'something', 'earlier', 'could', 'not', 'eat', 'pears', 'assistance', 'constant', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'Alien', 'Michael', 'Human', 'Maria', 'had', 'was', 'never', 'ending', 'source', 'amusement', 'ie', 'Michael', 'caught', 'Maria', 'something', 'down', 'seemly', 'sour', 'puss', 'Let', 'have', 'resigned', 'fate', 'storm', 'come.The', 'alien', 'side', 'things', 'are', 'definitely', 'emotive', 'heartfelt', 'yet', 'disquieting', 'psychopathic', 'Note', 'self', 'someone', 'discovered', 'be', 'space', 'alien', 'FEIGN', 'IGNORANCE', 'aliens', 'will', 'turn', 'dust', 'deemed', 'too', 'snoopy', 'nosed', 'government', 'feel', 'know', 'too', 'much', 'will', 'roll', 'body', 'ditch.The', 'last', 'season', 'new', 'character', 'introduced', 'cast', 'Jesse', 'secret', 'love', 'interest', 'Isabel', 'not', 'original', 'character', 'book', 'series', 'derived', 'addition', 'series', 'followed', 'books', 'closely', 'anyway', 'took', 'awhile', 'warm', 'up', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'intentionally', 'ironic', 'addition-Hispanic', 'people', 'having', 'least', 'stereotypical', 'history', 'current', 'past', 'being', 'illegal', 'aliens', 'love', 'space', 'alien', 'probably', 'as', 'illegal', 'anything', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'Isabel', 'suddenly', 'brothers', 'who', 'tell', 'sweethearts', 'are', 'planet', 'Isabel', 'secret', 'husband', 'who', 'then', 'get', 'clue', 'when', 'randomly', 'tossed', 'unmarked', 'vans', 'guys', 'suites', 'sunglasses', 'endlessly', 'interrogated', 'wife', 'exaggeration', 'get', 'idea', 'are', 'several', 'ways', 'end', 'series', 'are', 'kill', 'everyone', 'least', 'main', 'cast', 'blow', 'everything', 'else', 'up', 'show', 'creators', 'credit', 'really', 'One', 'cast', 'killed', 'off', 'one', 'was', 'absent', 'most', '3rd', 'season', 'was', 'one', 'psychopathic', 'aliens', 'was', 'not', 'entirely', 'unexpected', 'heartbreaking', 'rest', 'drive', 'sunset', 'beat', 'up', 'van', 'leaving', 'puzzled', 'parents', 'Human', 'Husband', 'away', 'Alien', 'Wife', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'convincing', 'pursue', 'dream', 'job', 'Yes', 'sex', 'alien', 'woman', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'transcendentally', 'hallucinogenic', 'few', 'things', 'can', 'surpass', '350,000', 'year', 'Boston', 'imagine', 'really', 'love', 'will', 'keep', 'track', 'use', 'premium', 'salary', 'buy', 'fugitives', 'better', 'van', 'air', 'conditioning.5', 'stars', 'take', 'away', 'one', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'plot', 'arc', 'relationship', 'Max', 'Liz', 'series', 'not', 'dark', 'fiction', 'expected', 'have', 'sort', 'satisfying', 'happy', 'resolution', 'One', 'episode', 'future', 'Max', 'saying', 'Liz', 'girlfriend', 'must', 'breakup', 'past', 'Max', 'self', 'else', 'planet', 'galaxy', 'universe', 'will', 'be', 'overrun', 'enemy', 'aliens', 'everyone', 'know', 'horribly', 'expectantly', 'defeated', 'later', 'when', 'Liz', 'forget', 'Max', 'back', 'BUT', 'reasonable', 'explanation', 'why', 'safe', 'do', 'so']",N/A
