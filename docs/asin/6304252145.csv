Banderas had zero chemistry with Connelly and their love scenes lacked the passion that the  characters in the book had.  Banderas is handsome and charismatic but not enough to play Francisco Leal.

Ferraz ""Just do it!""","[31, 36]","Chile and Argentina have gone through tragic years during the 70's, and this movie attempted to tackle what happened - everyday at the time, in Chile. Two good actors (Banderas and Connelly) seem lost in a poor script and directorship, although Allende knew the subject from the inside (I did not read her book yet).Banderas could not concentrate and acted quite bad, and you can see that the way his eyes wander in several scenes with Jennifer. She makes a big effort in her role, but this is not one of her good movies.In Jennifer's attempt to bring the South American political disaster to the screen, a much better (remarkable) film is Waking the Dead.

409876,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,6304252145,Lee Armstrong,"[6, 7]","Betty Kaplan's ""Of Love & Shadows"" may not be quite as provocative as the cover suggests, but it is an interesting adaptation of Isabel Allende's book about the fascist politics of Chile under General Pinochet.  This film was released in 1984.  Jennifer Connelly who stars would win her Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 2001 forA Beautiful Mind (Widescreen Awards Edition).  As Irene becomes politically aware, we observe great changes.  She moves from a superficial life of privilege to a dedicated freedom fighter.  She is engaged to her cousin Gustavo played by Camillo Gallardo.  The film sends out one signal as Gustavo disrobes and ""presents arms"" to his cousin then shifts as we see Gustavo as a hard government soldier.  Meanwhile, Irene encounters Francisco played by Antonio Bandaras.  Bandaras' performance was so real that I had a hard time hearing & even understanding him throughout the film.  Mumbling aside, he's a serious worker ""in the shadows"" from the start and adds a layer of love as he falls for Irene.  Why a guy with Antonio's looks was single in the first place was never explained.  Diego Wallraff plays Jose, Francico's brother who is a priest and tries to get the Cardinal to help with releasing human rights information to the world.  I found the backstory of the revolution in Chile to be interesting and the scenery as Irene & Francisco flee was breathtaking.  While Betty Kaplan's direction seems to leave great holes in the story and sends out mixed signals between its romantic story & political intrigue, it is interesting for an evening's viewing.

This one is probably the worst. It's a ridiculous caper movie trying to masquerade as a serious film. It's starts out fairly decently with the Banderas character, then puts Connelly's in clear focus as the central character. Once it gets to the scene where they are investigating the cave as two professionals, then start doing it on the very uncomfortable cave floor, you know it's a stupid film, and it just goes downhill from there. It turns into maudlin sentimentality after that, with very overplayed scenes of him helping her after being shot down in the street.  It wasn't the acting that was bad, though, it was everything else.  I was hoping Banderas would just take her on his motorcycle and get Jennifer out of there, because they both deserve a writer/director better than Betty Kaplan.",2,Betty takes Jennifer for a ride,963878400,"07 18, 2000",2000,941,"['Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'must', 'be', 'desperate', 'work', 'becuase', 'been', 'ages', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'anyhting', 'showed', 'considerable', 'talents', 'one', 'probably', 'worst', 'ridiculous', 'caper', 'movie', 'trying', 'masquerade', 'serious', 'film', 'out', 'fairly', 'decently', 'Banderas', 'character', 'then', 'Connelly', 'clear', 'focus', 'central', 'character', 'scene', 'where', 'are', 'investigating', 'cave', 'two', 'professionals', 'then', 'start', 'doing', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'cave', 'floor', 'know', 'stupid', 'film', 'just', 'downhill', 'there', 'maudlin', 'sentimentality', 'very', 'overplayed', 'scenes', 'helping', 'being', 'shot', 'down', 'street', 'was', ""n't"", 'acting', 'was', 'bad', 'was', 'everything', 'else', 'was', 'hoping', 'Banderas', 'would', 'just', 'take', 'motorcycle', 'get', 'Jennifer', 'there', 'deserve', 'writer/director', 'better', 'Betty', 'Kaplan']",Of Love & Shadows VHS
