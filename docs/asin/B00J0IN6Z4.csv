He looked as baffled as I was as he plodded through the script. A waste of time and money. Wooden script with a plot - while true - could have used some poetic license. I couldn't have cared less for any of the characters.,1,A waste of time and money,1404864000,"07 9, 2014",2014,330,"['am', 'not', 'reviewer', 'movies', 'have', 'ask', 'what', 'heck', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'was', 'doing', 'dog', 'movie', 'looked', 'as', 'baffled', 'was', 'plodded', 'script', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'Wooden', 'script', 'plot', 'true', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'poetic', 'license', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'cared', 'less', 'characters']",N/A

I cheered when these three fantastic souls were released and particularly thought the attitude of Jason was amazing considering you would expect such bitterness and he in particular has none.  I was disappointed thought about the cope out from the state of Arkansas and the Alfred Plea, the lack of courage and the amount of greed that state held since they did not do the right thing and exonerate these three for crimes they never committed and for being locked up because of a witch hunt; spending the better part of their youth behind bars.  Can you imagine being locked away from family and friends, life and love for eighteen long years!?  Luckily they are all young enough to start families of their own if they choose to and get on with their lives which they are all doing.I gave this introduction for anyone who needed it before watching this film.  It was a good reenactment however it could never have the power held with the original documentaries and the real people involved so I recommend you watch them all for the extreme experience of what all happened and what these teens went through, roped in like cattle and dragged off like prisoners.  I hope their lives are real happy today.  The movie was a good reenactment and I loved Reese Witherspoon.  I believe personally Terry Hobbs is the killer, the one scene last with the boys by a neighbor with no bone in the fight even though he denies it; even his own wife divorced him and is suspicious of him these days.",4,Good to get out there,1403222400,"06 20, 2014",2014,1583,"['am', 'somebody', 'who', 'followed', 'case', 'forever', 'have', 'documentaries', 'ever', 'made', 'cheered', 'when', 'three', 'fantastic', 'souls', 'were', 'released', 'particularly', 'thought', 'attitude', 'Jason', 'was', 'amazing', 'considering', 'would', 'expect', 'such', 'bitterness', 'particular', 'none', 'was', 'disappointed', 'thought', 'cope', 'state', 'Arkansas', 'Alfred', 'Plea', 'lack', 'courage', 'amount', 'greed', 'state', 'held', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'exonerate', 'three', 'crimes', 'never', 'committed', 'being', 'locked', 'up', 'witch', 'hunt', 'spending', 'better', 'part', 'youth', 'bars', 'Can', 'imagine', 'being', 'locked', 'away', 'family', 'friends', 'life', 'love', 'eighteen', 'long', 'years', 'Luckily', 'are', 'young', 'enough', 'start', 'families', 'own', 'choose', 'get', 'lives', 'are', 'doing.I', 'gave', 'introduction', 'anyone', 'who', 'needed', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'reenactment', 'however', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'power', 'held', 'original', 'documentaries', 'real', 'people', 'involved', 'so', 'recommend', 'watch', 'extreme', 'experience', 'what', 'happened', 'what', 'teens', 'went', 'roped', 'like', 'cattle', 'dragged', 'off', 'prisoners', 'hope', 'lives', 'are', 'real', 'happy', 'today', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'reenactment', 'loved', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'believe', 'personally', 'Terry', 'Hobbs', 'killer', 'one', 'scene', 'last', 'boys', 'neighbor', 'bone', 'fight', 'even', 'even', 'own', 'wife', 'divorced', 'suspicious', 'days']",N/A
1695199,ACJVGDN8G386P,B00J0IN6Z4,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[0, 0]","In 1996, HBO produced a documentary, &#34;Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills&#34;, about the much-publicized murder case of three young boys, Stevie Branch, Michael Moore, and Christopher Byers, who were murdered in the wooded creeks called Robin Hood Hills near West Memphis, Arkansas. The local authorities were convinced the murders were enacted by three older male teens, Damien Echols, Jessie Misskelley, Jr., and Jason Baldwin. According to the present film and the HBO documentaries, they were targeted by authorities as suspects in a kind of modern-day witch-hunt because of their interest in the occult, horror films, and Heavy Metal music. Echols was often seen wearing black clothing, an affront to the predominant Christian community of West Memphis. He later admitted to reading about Aleister Crowley but asserted he had never read any of Crowley's actual writings.The case against the three teens hinged primarily on the notion that the murders were committed as a kind of sacrifice in a satanic ritual. Also, dubious testimony, particularly that of Vicki Hutcheson and her son Aaron, was later recanted. Hutcheson claimed initially that she had seen the three teens involved in Satanic rituals and that Damien Eckles had bragged about committing the murders at the event. She later said she had been coerced by police to offer false evidence, fearing authorities might take away her son. Her son Aaron in a video-taped interview said he had seen the actual murders, but then later when he was older withdrew his testimony claiming he knew nothing about the crimes. Other evidence, such as the possible involvement of an African-American who ended up in the ladies' room and smeared blood on the walls at Bojangles Restaurant the night of the murders was never adequately followed up on. No actual physical evidence linked the boys with the murders. Their prosecution was mainly based on circumstantial evidence concerning their interest in the occult.Twenty years after the convictions of the so-called &#34;West Memphis Three&#34; and 17 years after the HBO Documentary &#34;Paradise Lost&#34;, the film &#34;the Devil's Knot&#34; based on the book of the same name was released, starring Colin Firth as Ron Lax, a private investigator who became interested in the case, and Reese Witherspoon as Pamela Hobbs, the mother of victim Stevie Branch. First off, the film is beautifully shot. The lush swampy areas portraying the Robin Hood Hills appear almost like photos you might see in a postcard. The night shots are particularly beautiful, although simultaneously horrific as the setting for the brutal murders.Critics claimed the film didn't add anything new to the understanding of the case, but I don't believe this was the filmmakers' intentions. The point of the film I believe was simply to tell the story in a dramatic/narrative format rather than a documentary. (HBO produced three documentaries in all about the case and probably assisted in the revelation about the poor police investigation, the witch-hunt sensibilities towards members of their community interested in the occult, and the dubious testimonies which led eventually to the release of the West Memphis Three.) Apart from whether or not audiences will believe the West Memphis Three are guilty or innocent, much of the film is about the complexity of such cases. Unless a defendant truthfully confesses to a crime, many questions and strange circumstances surround most cases. In many instances, the whole truth may be nearly unobtainable, such as questions which still surround the JFK Assassination.An excellent and underrated film. The main reasons &#34;The Devil's Knot&#34; works as well as it does is because of the fine acting, particularly Witherspoon, Firth, and an honorable mention to James Hamrick as Damien Echols, the wonderful direction, and also because of the film's point of view. The film shows both sides of the case. The local authorities were pressured by the community to find the three teens guilty since a rift between conservative Christians and those interested in the occult was growing wider. In the film, one character states that those interested in the occult were bound to become enmeshed in a crime case sooner or later. Of course, the most informative details can be found in the three HBO documentaries, &#34;Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills&#34; (1996), &#34;Paradise Lost 2: Revelations&#34; (2000), and &#34;Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory&#34;

1695200,A2GPLOLLE6BUDT,B00J0IN6Z4,Dave,"[1, 1]","We moved from the Philadelphia area to Tennessee in the very late 1970's.  This case was covered by the news in Tennessee even though it took place across the border in Arkansas.  I remember quite clearly that I thought that the case was pushed to a conviction at that time by the news and that it was somewhat likely a miscarriage of justice had occurred.  But, being relatively conservative and having a new family,  I had a life to live and it was a story that just bothered me but not to the extent I felt compelled to do something about it.  Besides it was in another state and I did not have access to all of the details.  Years later, I watched a documentary on the case that reminded me of the concern I had that these boys were railroaded.  This film came very close to the facts presented in the documentary, but in all fairness was less supportive of a specific answer.  Because truth only spilled out occasionally after the sentencing of the boys, it was not sufficient to keep up public interest.  I do not know who was guilty in this terrible crime, but I am sure that the standard of reasonable doubt was never met because of social and political pressure necessary to find guilt, whether or not it was present.  Since there was no organized group willing to spend money, time and effort in their defense, they got a bad trial even though the accused and the victims were all young boys.  Our system of justice is still one of the best on earth, but sometimes it fails because of human management that will forever be subject to the prejudice of human nature.  While the convicted boys lost a significant portion of the most enjoyable and productive parts of their lives, they did not lose the chance to eventually and partially overcome what their society had done to them.  I believe the demand for swift punishment and the pressures it put on the court, prosecutors and police was the driver in this instance when it should have been the protection of society that should have been the deciding factor in sentencing.  Punishment and revenge cannot be our overriding goals.  We need to focus upon what measures are necessary to give reasonable protection to society that we will be protected from those most likely to commit crimes again.  This is a difficult goal and full of uncertainty in practice.  But, if we do not believe that such a goal is substantially preferable and possible a vast majority of the time, why not just adopt Sharia law as a simple primitive alternative?",4,"Guilt Should Be Beyond a Reasonable Doubt, The Standard Was Much Lower In This Case",1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,2497,"['moved', 'Philadelphia', 'area', 'Tennessee', 'very', 'late', '1970', 'case', 'was', 'covered', 'news', 'Tennessee', 'even', 'took', 'place', 'border', 'Arkansas', 'remember', 'quite', 'clearly', 'thought', 'case', 'was', 'pushed', 'conviction', 'time', 'news', 'was', 'somewhat', 'likely', 'miscarriage', 'justice', 'had', 'occurred', 'being', 'relatively', 'conservative', 'having', 'new', 'family', 'had', 'life', 'live', 'was', 'story', 'just', 'bothered', 'not', 'extent', 'felt', 'compelled', 'do', 'something', 'was', 'state', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'access', 'details', 'Years', 'later', 'watched', 'documentary', 'case', 'reminded', 'concern', 'had', 'boys', 'were', 'railroaded', 'film', 'came', 'very', 'close', 'facts', 'presented', 'documentary', 'fairness', 'was', 'less', 'supportive', 'specific', 'answer', 'truth', 'only', 'spilled', 'out', 'occasionally', 'sentencing', 'boys', 'was', 'not', 'sufficient', 'keep', 'up', 'public', 'interest', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'was', 'guilty', 'terrible', 'crime', 'am', 'sure', 'standard', 'reasonable', 'doubt', 'was', 'never', 'met', 'social', 'political', 'pressure', 'necessary', 'find', 'guilt', 'not', 'was', 'present', 'was', 'organized', 'group', 'willing', 'spend', 'money', 'time', 'effort', 'defense', 'got', 'bad', 'trial', 'even', 'accused', 'victims', 'were', 'young', 'boys', 'system', 'justice', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'earth', 'human', 'management', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'subject', 'prejudice', 'human', 'nature', 'convicted', 'boys', 'lost', 'significant', 'portion', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'productive', 'parts', 'lives', 'did', 'not', 'lose', 'chance', 'eventually', 'partially', 'overcome', 'what', 'society', 'had', 'done', 'believe', 'demand', 'swift', 'punishment', 'pressures', 'put', 'court', 'prosecutors', 'police', 'was', 'driver', 'instance', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'protection', 'society', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'deciding', 'factor', 'sentencing', 'Punishment', 'revenge', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'overriding', 'goals', 'need', 'focus', 'what', 'measures', 'are', 'necessary', 'give', 'reasonable', 'protection', 'society', 'will', 'be', 'protected', 'most', 'likely', 'commit', 'crimes', 'again', 'difficult', 'goal', 'full', 'uncertainty', 'practice', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'goal', 'substantially', 'preferable', 'possible', 'vast', 'majority', 'time', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'adopt', 'Sharia', 'law', 'simple', 'primitive', 'alternative']",N/A

1695202,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00J0IN6Z4,Doug Park,"[1, 1]","Based on the book by the same title, DEVIL's KNOT is a docu-drama about the 1993 ritual murders of three eight-year-old boys in West Memphis, Arkansas. This film does not contain any basic information that is not already covered in the documentariesParadise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood HillsandWest of Memphis. It does, however, provide some fairly interesting reenacted personal perspectives of the various parties: victims' families, the accused ""Memphis 3"" and certain of their friends, the police and prosecution, the defense teams, etc. DEVIL's KNOT makes for a compelling enough show and is expertly filmed with decent but not great acting. Though I'm sure that there are some misrepresentations of certain details, it is faithful to the basic events of this case. The biggest limitation is that those who have read the various books and seen earlier films will not find anything terribly new here while casual viewers who are unfamiliar with the case will find all the various characters and shifting perspectives confusing.Colin Firth gives a nice performance as private investigator for the defense Ron Lax; ditto for Reese Witherspoon as Pam Hobbs. DEVIL's KNOT might have worked better with a stricter focus on one or maybe both of these characters, even if that meant ignoring certain other people and factors in the case.Regardless, this film is very revealing of how incompetent police work, selective use of evidence by the prosecution, and public hysteria in this rather superstitious Bible Belt community led to the denial of reasonable doubt for the accused ""Memphis 3."" Without telling you what to think or pointing the finger unduly, it also cursorily examines other potential suspects. There are some brief bits of courtroom drama, but again, the focus changes just as things get really interesting.In short, DEVIL's KNOT is quite watchable, but the attempt to tell the entire story in a narrative of less than two hours is inadequate and dissatisfying.WARNING: Though there's not a lot of gore, there are some brief and graphic post mortem shots of the young victims.",3,"""This place is like Hell on Earth""",1402963200,"06 17, 2014",2014,2099,"['Based', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'DEVIL', 'KNOT', 'docu-drama', '1993', 'ritual', 'murders', 'three', 'eight-year-old', 'boys', 'West', 'Memphis', 'Arkansas', 'film', 'not', 'contain', 'basic', 'information', 'not', 'already', 'covered', 'documentariesParadise', 'Lost', 'Child', 'Murders', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'HillsandWest', 'Memphis', 'however', 'provide', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'reenacted', 'personal', 'perspectives', 'various', 'parties', 'victims', 'families', 'accused', 'Memphis', '3', 'certain', 'friends', 'police', 'prosecution', 'defense', 'teams', 'etc', 'DEVIL', 'KNOT', 'compelling', 'enough', 'show', 'expertly', 'filmed', 'decent', 'not', 'great', 'acting', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'misrepresentations', 'certain', 'details', 'faithful', 'basic', 'events', 'case', 'biggest', 'limitation', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'various', 'books', 'seen', 'earlier', 'films', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'anything', 'terribly', 'new', 'here', 'casual', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'case', 'will', 'find', 'various', 'characters', 'shifting', 'perspectives', 'confusing.Colin', 'Firth', 'nice', 'performance', 'private', 'investigator', 'defense', 'Ron', 'Lax', 'ditto', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Pam', 'Hobbs', 'DEVIL', 'KNOT', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'stricter', 'focus', 'one', 'maybe', 'characters', 'even', 'meant', 'ignoring', 'certain', 'other', 'people', 'factors', 'case.Regardless', 'film', 'very', 'revealing', 'how', 'incompetent', 'police', 'work', 'selective', 'use', 'evidence', 'prosecution', 'public', 'hysteria', 'rather', 'superstitious', 'Bible', 'Belt', 'community', 'led', 'denial', 'reasonable', 'doubt', 'accused', 'Memphis', '3', 'telling', 'what', 'think', 'pointing', 'finger', 'unduly', 'also', 'cursorily', 'other', 'potential', 'suspects', 'are', 'brief', 'bits', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'again', 'focus', 'just', 'things', 'get', 'really', 'interesting.In', 'short', 'DEVIL', 'KNOT', 'quite', 'watchable', 'attempt', 'tell', 'entire', 'story', 'narrative', 'less', 'two', 'hours', 'inadequate', 'dissatisfying.WARNING', 'not', 'lot', 'gore', 'are', 'brief', 'graphic', 'post', 'mortem', 'shots', 'young', 'victims']",N/A
1695203,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00J0IN6Z4,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","DEVIL'S KNOT (Prod. Jessie Misskelley, Jr. and Jason Baldwin, Dir. Atom Egoyan, 2013, 113 minutes, based on the 2002 bookDevil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three by Mara Leverittwhich was originally supposed to have been written by John Mark Byers) is the back-to-the-origin story of the horrendous ""Robin Hood Hills"" murders, allegedly perpetrated by ""The West Memphis Three"", Damien Echols, James Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley, Jr. This is the sad, unsolved torture/murder of three young boys in Arkansas (where it borders with Tennessee).Chief among the involved characters in that of Ron Lax (an amazing-as-always Colin Firth), the private investigator who was so instrumental in the Three's later release from jail. Here Lax is seen as an ephemeral, almost disinterested party as the case unfolds to hunt down the killers of the poor children.This film hinges also on Pam Hobbs (an equally stunning and Oscar-worthy Reese Witherspoon), the mother of one of the victims and ex-wife of the now-alleged perpetrator of the killings (Terry Hobbs, as played by fit-him-anywhere bit player Alessandro Nivola). Added to this illustrious cast, because they are all excellent, is the on-location filming in Georgia.I have to hand out great credit to the actors playing the accused boys: the lovely James Hamrick as Damien Echols; an equally attractive Kristopher Higgins as Jessie Misskelley and a very wonderful, tender performance by Seth Meriwether as James Baldwin. These are sensitive, accurate portrayals and great care obviously had to be taken especially with the role of Echols.This is a simple, straightforward film showing us the chain of events, the sadness and strain visited on this poor, small community and a real you-are-there feel that is not overdone like it usually is. I remarked to the wife that I could feel the dirty heat and poverty in this film as I have felt in few others. That is why I was puzzled by the appearance of none other than Colin Firth.It gladdens me to see him here with an impeccable accent--which he has easily managed once before in another film--but why did he of all people do it? As to the film, as powerful and necessary as it is to be established in this way, I viewed the film as ultimately unnecessary. A great deal of silly confusion is thrown in--such as an HBO documentarist who accuses one of the early suspects of doing something ""very strange"" and then the entire thing is abandoned.Final kudos go to the great Canadian Bruce Greenwood as the stupid Judge Burnett and the very brilliant little turn by Kevin Durand as John Mark Byers (stepfather to one of the murdered children).Now, I must say I have followed this story with interest since seeing HBO's 2nd documentary on the subject. I had the chance to see the original documentary and this was on the heels of the release of HBO's 3rd and final documentary on the subject (see my reviews of the HBOThe Paradise Lost Trilogy Collector's Editiondocumentary series). The cap to this, in my opinion, was the excellent documentaryWest Of Memphis(see my review), which leaned on the history of the case then took off after Terry Hobbs as the prime suspect.All of which leads me to proclaim: this story is done, over and finished. Echols has written his book, the other two produced this great film, but as I said, why make it now? I respect it, but a part of me sees this as overkill. And anyone would learn/benefit far more from the documentaries than from this movie.Don't mistake me: I respect and really like this restrained, no-nonsense film and Colin Firth adds luster wherever he be.

1695204,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00J0IN6Z4,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[1, 2]","Not all that long ago, Docudrama released the Paradise Lost Trilogy, a series of three films exploring the death of three eight-year-old boys.  Clocking in at an impressive 400 minutes between them, I&#8217;m not all that convinced that there&#8217;s any single lesson so prevalent as is the fact that the American justice system failed not only the victims and the victims&#8217; families but also the young men accused of having performed these grisly murders.  Syphoning through a veritable mountain of circumstantial evidence, a reasonable person might even conclude how charges were brought in this case to begin with &#8230; but that&#8217;s an argument for another time, another day.As often happens when Hollywood finds documentaries so compelling, it was only natural that a big budget motion picture follow, and that&#8217;s largely what you get with DEVIL&#8217;S KNOT: a far theatrical yet much simpler exploration of only a smattering of the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth that serves a relatively curtailed narrative.  Is it good?  Yes.  Is it great?  Not really.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)From the product packaging: &#8220;Three young boys playing in the nearby woods never come home for dinner.  In the rush to find and convict the killers, police focus on a trio of teenagers suspected of devil worship.  As the mother of one of the murdered boys (Reese Witherspoon) tries to come to grips with this unspeakable tragedy, she is desperate to believe that the killers have been found and will be brought to justice.  It is only when a private investigator (Colin Firth) reveals that the evidence doesn&#8217;t all add up, that the community is forced to face the reality that the true killer might be still out there.&#8221;Unfortunately, that product packaging isn&#8217;t entirely accurate, as Firth&#8217;s character &#8211; investigator Ron Lax &#8211; appears sparingly in the motion picture, but the same could be said of all of these people: they appear in too little screen time for them to legitimately flesh out as real people.  What this does is it allows the story &#8211; a fascinating one in its own right &#8211; to remain front-and-center, thereby robbing DEVIL&#8217;S KNOT of what could&#8217;ve been a greater emotional connection, that of the mother to her son.  Witherspoon tries to muster up what gusto she can, but her best moments here are too few, too far between to have the teeth needed to elevate an otherwise mundane presentation.  (Here&#8217;s a tip: Witherspoon herself made headlines for screaming at cops not all that long ago, and that&#8217;s what she does best here.)Firth &#8211; an actor I&#8217;ve never been overly fond of to begin with &#8211; is, therefore, given the task of standing in to represent a moral compass for a community which appears to have none &#8230; except it&#8217;s clear that everyone believes (despite mounting evidence against it) Satanic worship was somehow involved.  Firth&#8217;s Lax is only given a single scene that I recall against it, and the rest of his time in this story sadly amounts to grim looks with forced puppy-dog-eyes &#8211; an all-too-convenient theatrical convention &#8211; so, while it&#8217;s clear he doesn&#8217;t believe justice is being served, he never quite comments sufficiently on ANY possible theory for me, as a viewer, to believe he has a clue.Isn&#8217;t that the problem with justice, though, in films of this nature?  The audience is told over and over again (or it&#8217;s very strongly implied) that the accused have been branded by evidence entirely circumstantial; but this script by Paul Harris Boardman and Scott Derrickson (adapted from Mara Leveritt&#8217;s book) never tries to sort out the facts and point us in any other logical direction.  Instead, they&#8217;re only interested in highlighting innocence, leaving us with three dead bodies at the end of the day and no one to hold accountable.  Again, it pulls at our heartstrings, sure &#8211; I don&#8217;t think anyone likes to see anyone else falsely accused &#8211; but DEVIL&#8217;S KNOT never even attempts to clarify the &#8216;lies&#8217; told by the accused linking them to the murder, leaving them like a stain we&#8217;re only supposed to ignore.If unsolved mysteries are your preference, then you&#8217;ll probably find much to explore in DEVIL&#8217;S KNOT.  Me?  I tend to prefer the less theatrical, more restrained documentaries on the subject.  They certainly offer up far more detail to consider, and they make for a much more compelling exploration of the failures of the legal system as they apply to the &#8216;West Memphis Three.&#8217;DEVIL&#8217;S KNOT (2013) is produced by Worldview Entertainment, RLJ Entertainment, and The Weinstein Company.  DVD distribution is being handled by RLJ Entertainment and Image Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications?  The film is smartly made with some very high quality sights and sounds, though I&#8217;ll admit I struggled with some of the uninspired cinematography to so much of it; sadly, it plays like your average made-for-TV movie throughout so very much of it.  Lastly &#8211; if it&#8217;s special features you want &#8211; then you have some deleted scenes, some cast interviews/reflections, and a making-of short to anticipate.RECOMMENDED.  As disturbed as some might be by DEVIL&#8217;S KNOT, I suspect those people would be vastly more disturbed should they seek out the documentaries already made on this subject matter; that&#8217;s probably because in order to produce something resembling a filmable story screenwriters Paul Harris Boardman and Scott Derrickson have to synthesize a large quantity of additional circumstantial evidence.  (Seriously, I&#8217;d encourage folks who can sit through documentaries to check those out in lieu of this film; but if flicks are more your &#8216;thing,&#8217; then this one is good, not great, as it raised more questions than those involved seem interested in addressing.)In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Image Entertainment and RLJ Entertainment provided me with a DVD copy of DEVIL&#8217;S KNOT by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.",3,KNOT Plays Out Like A 'Cliff Notes' Version To A Story Explored Much Better In The Paradise Lost Trilogy,1402272000,"06 9, 2014",2014,6710,"['Not', 'long', 'ago', 'Docudrama', 'released',

1695206,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B00J0IN6Z4,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[0, 1]","First off, I never gave much thought to the controversy surrounding the West Memphis Three. I was always around bands who protested their sentencing and read about the objections to their trials, but never gave it any more thought than that. I never watched or reviewed any of the ""Paradise Lost"" documentaries so I didn't feel like I had the right to take a side on the subject. All I knew was three little boys were murdered and it was a horrible tragedy.In 1993, three young boys go into the woods of a small town in West Memphis, Arkansas. After their bodies are found in the river, the entire region is turned upside down as the murderer is tracked down. Three teenage locals accused of being Satanists are suspects in the killings. Have the authorities found the killers or is there more to the story that we've never heard?When I saw a movie was being made based on the murders at Robin Hood Hill in West Memphis, Arkansas, I didn't even entertain seeing it. Not that I'm an unfeeling human being. I just try to put my focus on certain types of films and stick within those parameters because of time constraints. My mind was changed when I found out Scott Derrickson co-wrote and executive produced ""Devil's Knot.""Scott Derrickson is a Hollywood director who shares many of the same Christian beliefs I do. It just so happens he wrote and directed what is in my opinion one of the finest examples of a supernatural horror film in 2013 - ""Sinister."" He also directed ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose,"" ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" remake, ""Hellraiser: Inferno,"" and the upcoming ""Deliver Us from Evil."" Recently, Derrickson announced he's attached to helm the upcoming ""Doctor Strange"" movie for Marvel and Disney. Needless to say, I have a deep respect for his work and anything he puts his name on.Director Atom Egoyan's ""Devil's Knot"" isn't meant to break any new ground in the investigations of the West Memphis killings. I see it as a tool to expose and tell the story to new people who might not be interested in watching documentaries or reading pages of case studies. It's an easy way to get people educated about one of the most infamous murder trials in American history.""Devil's Knot"" encouraged me to do some research on the killings. As soon as the credits rolled onscreen, I hit the internet and compared what I'd seen to the actual evidence and professional conjecture I found. It's safe to say Egoyan's movie doesn't embellish much and sticks to the facts.I was very impressed by the cast assembled for the indie film. ""Devil's Knot"" boasts Oscar winners Reese Witherspoon and Colin Firth as the two lead characters. Supporting actors include Stephen Moyer, Bruce Greenwood, Elias Koteas, and Alessandro Nivola. It's obvious they all took the movie seriously and put their heart and souls into their performance.""Devil's Knot"" was never rated for the U.S. and contains disturbing images, language, and nudity. The crime scene photographs and sequences were enough to make me cringe and look away at points and I'm a horror film fanatic. It's just something about knowing this was based on true events that made me uneasy watching those scenes. The only nudity is of the bodies of the three murder victims. Trust me, there's nothing gratifying or attractive in what we are shown. It's purely used to display the severity of the perverse and sick nature of the crimes.A few extra features are included for the DVD version of ""Devil's Knot."" Two featurettes delve into ""The Making of 'Devil's Knot'"" and ""Getting into Character: The Cast of 'Devil's Knot.'""

1695207,AFEWKJ76O5785,B00J0IN6Z4,goth chick,"[0, 0]","""Devil's Knot"" is a well-crafted film about the saga of the West Memphis Three.  Based on Mara Leveritt's book by the same name (which I had read when it was first published - an excellent book, and I highly recommend it), the film focuses on the tragedy of the gruesome murder of three children - and the gross injustice of condemning three innocent young men for crimes they never committed.  The performances by the entire cast are outstanding; Colin Firth and Reese Witherspoon are brilliant as investigator Ron Lax and Pamela Hobbs, the grief-stricken mother who comes to realize the wrong men were convicted of the murders.  Mychael Danna's original score is poignant and haunting.Director Atom Egoyan delivers a very good film, although it's a little too long, and the pace is rather slow.  I was a bit taken aback at the final credits - no mention was made of the fact that a scene from the 1975 20th Century Fox movie ""Race With The Devil"" was incorporated into ""Devil's Knot""; this is when Vicki Hutcheson (portrayed by Mireille Enos) concocts her phony story about meeting Damien Echols for a nighttime outdoor ritual - the ""Race With The Devil"" scene depicts a bonfire ritual in which a young blonde woman is killed.  Very odd this was not mentioned in the credits for ""Devil's Knot"".  Copyright issue?  Well, c'est la vie, I guess.

1695208,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00J0IN6Z4,Grady Harp,"[3, 8]","Atom Egoyan directs a screenplay written by Paul Harris Boardman and Scott Derrickson based on the book `The Devil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three' written by Mara Leveritt that outlines one of the more gruesome murder stories as well as a gross mismanagement of a judicial trial that makes of a film that grinds at our gut long after the credits detail share the aftermath of this heinous incident.May 5, 1993 three young boys - Chris Byers (Brandon Spink), Michael Moore (Paul Boardman, Jr) and Stevie Branch (Jet Jurgensmeyer) left together to play in the woods and never returned. Stevie's mother Pam Hobbs  (Reese Witherspoon) and father Terry (Alessandro Nivola) are the most involved at searching for their lost son, but the police too soon line up three suspects -Damien Echols (James Hamrick), Jessie Misskelley, Jr (Christopher Higgins) and Jason Baldwin (Seth Meriwether) because of their anti-social behavior and apparent Satanic cult worship (not proved), place them on trial for the murders and convicted them. The process is not unlike the Salem Witch Hunts. An investigator Ron Lax (Colin Firth) loathes the death penalty and works toward discovering the flaws in the investigation, arrest, and trial (led by Judge David Burnett as played by Bruce Greenwood) - evidence that strongly suggests that the three teens arrested were not the true perpetrators, that the real murderer may still be at large.The Wikipedia summarizes the incident well: `The West Memphis Three are three men who were tried and convicted as teenagers in 1994 of the 1993 murders of three boys in West Memphis, Arkansas. Damien Echols was sentenced to death, Jessie Misskelley, Jr. was sentenced to life imprisonment plus two 20-year sentences, and Jason Baldwin was sentenced to life imprisonment. During the trial, the prosecution asserted that the children were killed as part of a Satanic ritual. A number of documentaries have been based on the case, and celebrities and musicians have held fund raisers in the belief that they are innocent.'In addition to the excellent performances buy Reese Witherspoon, Alessandro Nivola and Colin Firth, the supporting cast includes such luminaries as Elias Koteas, Kevin Durand, Amy Ryan, and Dane DeHaan who plays a central role as Chris Morgan. The pacing, cinematography and direction are first rate, but th e fact that this hideous crime remains essentially unsolved is the terrifying aspect of this very fine little film.

1695209,A2FMFR4FX5HKEO,B00J0IN6Z4,Joseph N. Konwinski,"[0, 2]","The soul-crushing truths which impel this narrative give it an undeserved authority.  Ultimately, we should all of us pray that these events are fictional.  But no.  Colin Firth is preposterous, so flagrantly stupid a choice for lead that I smell some manner of nasty metaphysical agenda at play.  Firth is amateurish as a successful Arkansan private investigator.  It seems to be a doomed effort for actors who are not Southern to portray Southerners.  Firth fails with an arrogant relish.  Not once does Firth address another person with &#34;Please.&#34;  This is contemptible.  Southerners ask, they don't order.  And they ask &#34;Please.&#34;  Always.  The phoning-in of a quasi British aristocrat with some Southern &#34;accent&#34; is painful.  In the words of our own American marvel, Steve Martin, hearing faked Southern speech makes a Southerner feel &#34;like he's got lunchmeat in his shoes...&#34;  And hearing same deployed by a successful British actor makes it worse, like maybe several layers of olive loaf all down in thereReese Witherspoon's a pro, an adorable pro.  She always has been, always will be.There are fine portrayals of Arkansan police officers, crushed by what they see and by what duty requires of them.  Crushed, but mobilized.  Cole Younger once said &#34;...only a natural fool or an innocent madman would choose to be a criminal...&#34;  The former would do well to view Devil's Knot, get a glimpse at the type of men and women who seek to cage criminals.  Or kill them.  Either option works for me.  The bond common to all police officers is that of the broken-hearted who must go on.However, we remain human.  Wondrously, clumsily human, just people trying to deal with vile enormities and treacheries beyond us, not of our world.  We drop the ball, lose evidence, get played.  We collapse weeping, armed, wearing a badge.  But we don't quit.  Never will.  In the end, we win.I should let this one &#34;thing&#34; go, but Lordy Lordy, I can't.  I won't!  I'm like the dog that caught the car with this one.  Midway thru, during trial, the silly Mr Firth actually rises, with court in-session, Judge seated, rises and ambles gracefully over to the bailiff's gate while Prosecution and Defense contends at bench with His Honor.  The silly Mr Firth stands there, I guess eavesdropping to get some skinny which might help his bottom line.  Maybe to the nasty idiots who cast him, Firth represents a beacon or Batman there to oversee things.  This conduct is criminal, a misdemeanor, contempt of court.  Yet the bailiff does not act, nor the Judge, to demand of Mr Silly that he immediately sit back down and shut up.  Please.  Excuse me, Southerners never employ &#34;shut up.&#34;  We prefer &#34;Please be quiet.&#34;  There's not a Courtroom in this country, properly run, Southern, Northern, Inuit, hillbilly, Tex-Mex, vegan, pick one, where such an act would be unrestrained, just allowed to happen.  Nope.But, being human, I've just failed, introducing levity where, perhaps, it doesn't belong.  Forgive me, please.There are the facts, there's this movie.  And there's us, human beings where we are, surrendering to the deadly attractions of evil, fighting back in self-defense if we've got the spittle for it.  And we usually do.  Heroically so.For me, this movie was most effective, worth its price of admission.  I say this is a movie for those of you who have a heart.  Those of you who don't well, hey, we will all, each and every one, meet our Maker one day.

It was so well-publicized that those kinds of viewers are hard to come by.It does not resolve anything It just leaves some of the strange and awful things that happened in this little community and to these people, up in the air.Colin Firth is quite fine in it, but his character seemed unnecessary.  He was meant, I am sure, to be the reasonable doubter who tries to sort out the facts.  In so doing, he is the representative of the viewer.  He ends up not getting much to do, though his character is based on a real person.  (And his Southern accent is perfectly fine.)Everyone else is quite good.  I have no complaints.

For me, no parent of the murdered boys touched me more - perhaps because there was so much footage of her in the news/documentaries and she seemingly wore her heart on her sleeve.Bottom line is that I don't think this movie was made for those of us who were hooked/shocked upon the first seeing of Paradise Lost when it showed on HBO so long ago.

1695227,A2EK4SOCZCYNVK,B00J0IN6Z4,"Robert Chadwick ""robbchadwick""","[3, 4]","The West Memphis Three / Robin Hood Hills murder case has received so much media attention over the years that it&#8217;s hard to believe there&#8217;s anyone who doesn&#8217;t know about it. In fact, I would normally include spoiler warnings before discussing a recent film in detail; but it hardly seems necessary in this case since there are absolutely no surprises or revelations that are not already well known.At least two full length books, &#34;Blood of Innocents&#34; and &#34;Devils&#8217; Knot&#34; (the book this film is based on) have been devoted to the subject, as well as countless articles, essays and editorials.  There have been three &#34;Paradise Lost&#34; documentaries as well as the more recent &#34;West of Memphis&#34; covering the case in minute detail &#8230; not to mention the television coverage through such programs as &#34;48 Hours&#34;. Damien Echols has even written extensively in the form of memoirs regarding the case and the time he spent in prison after being found guilty.Most of what has been written or filmed about this case takes the position that a terrible miscarriage of justice occurred in West Memphis with the conviction of Echols, Baldwin & Misskelley; and that may very well be true. &#34;Blood of Innocents&#34;, the original book on the subject, is perhaps the only major coverage of this case which defends the police and the prosecution and rightly or wrongly lays out the evidence used to prosecute and convict the three West Memphis teenagers of these murders. The &#34;Paradise Lost&#34; documentaries were very well done and attempted to be fair, even though they also leaned heavily toward the defendants when dispensing the benefit of the doubt. I believe that is likely the reasonable thing to do with so much confusing evidence with many points in dispute.&#34;Devil&#8217;s Knot&#34;, both the book and the film, take the point of view that the police and prosecutors almost intentionally set out to railroad and convict three innocent children of these crimes. While there may have been a great deal of misunderstanding, mishandling and interpretation of evidence and so forth, I doubt the police, district attorney or trial judge knowingly and willingly sent two adolescents to a sentence of life in prison and one other to a death sentence on purpose &#8230; and that is the problem I have with &#34;Devil&#8217;s Knot&#34;, both the book and this film.&#34;Devil&#8217;s Knot&#34;, the film, features several well-known actors (Reese Witherspoon, Colin Firth and Dane DeHaan and others) in a cast that does a credible job with the material at hand. It is certainly worth watching for students of the case, even though I must confess that I watched it streaming on Netflix &#8230; only a few weeks after its release in theaters, which may speak volumes in itself. I own the other books and films on these murders; but I won&#8217;t be purchasing this one. It&#8217;s just not that relevant.All dramatizations of true stories take certain liberties, of course; but &#34;Devil&#8217;s Knot&#34;, in keeping with its general POV, distorts quite a lot. For instance, although Pam Hobbs has in recent years come to doubt the guilt of the West Memphis Three in favor of suspecting her former husband, she certainly did not begin to do so immediately after the trials. The film also introduces Chris Morton as a major character in the film while he has always been treated as a rather minor blip on the radar in other works on the subject. &#34;Devil&#8217;s Knot&#34; makes much ado of Mr Morton&#8217;s &#8220;confession&#8221; during questioning by authorities in California, when it was clearly sarcasm born of frustration after being in police custody for hours. Interestingly enough, the film downplays the confession of Jessie Misskelley. While it&#8217;s true that Mr Misskelley&#8217;s original confession was problematical due to his intelligence level and mistakes within the confession itself, he continued to confess on several occasions to authorities when he was not even asked to do so. These are just a few examples of inaccuracies which plague this film. It&#8217;s enjoyable to watch if you know the facts and know what to take with a grain of salt; but just don&#8217;t depend on this one for the facts. Enough said.For those who don&#8217;t know, the West Memphis Three utilized a little known and rarely used legal move known as an Alford Plea to gain their freedom in August of 2011 through an agreement with the prosecutor, who may have doubted that he could get another guilty verdict in case they were granted a new trial. In explanation, an Alford Plea is a guilty plea that affords the right to a continued claim of innocence. This means that Echols, Baldwin and Misskelley remain convicted felons with no right to sue the state of Arkansas for wrongful imprisonment.  However, they are free and Damien Echols no longer has to fear the death penalty. In their position I believe it was a reasonable path for them whether they bear any guilt in this case or not.",3,Three stars for the actors ... none for accuracy,1402876800,"06 16,

1695228,A387BD735MI50R,B00J0IN6Z4,R. Schultz,"[0, 0]","I didn't see the apparently more comprehensive account given in the &#34;Paradise Lost&#34; series, so this movie has been my only exposure to the facts surrounding the case of the  Arkansas murder of three little boys who went out for a bike ride in the woods. The film has a somber, fated tone that drew me in from the start. I felt it presented a good summary of the twists and turns the case took before and after the conviction of three local teenagers presumed to have been involved with satanic worship. But as with real life, the movie doesn't present any easy answers. Suspicions continue to float in as complicated a pattern as the curls and eddies taken by the actual stream where the boys' bodies were found.The film generally takes a low-key approach, but is shocking nonetheless. Of course there is the shock of the murders themselves. But then it is shocking to see how readily the town's people settle for the first answer that comes their way implicating the &#34;weirdo Goth&#34; kids in town. So eager are most people for some resolution, that they accept what immediately seems to be the most obvious answer, and then they hysterically defend that position even after more complicating evidence comes to light. This comes close to being a study in mob vengeance.The biggest shock in this film though is seeing how further clues point to the possibility of the guilt of so many other people in town, people who on the surface seemed to be good, upstanding citizens. We've seen that to be the case with so many high profile cases. It turns out that all sorts of local people have been leading angry, deranged lives under their faade of backyard barbecue normalcy. But no matter how many times true crime accounts reveal tangled, far-flung skeins of motive, it is always and ever shocking to encounter such widespread malevolence yet again.If you don't have the time or inclination to probe further into this case, this movie will provide you with a good, intelligent account of the crime and its surrounding circumstances.",4,"An Atmospheric, Intelligent Account",1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,2040,"['did', ""n't"", 'see', 'apparently', 'more', 'comprehensive', 'account', 'given', '34', 'Paradise', 'Lost', '34', 'series', 'movie', 'been', 'only', 'exposure', 'facts', 'surrounding', 'case', 'Arkansas', 'murder', 'three', 'little', 'boys', 'who', 'went', 'out', 'bike', 'ride', 'woods', 'film', 'somber', 'fated', 'tone', 'drew', 'start', 'felt', 'presented', 'good', 'summary', 'twists', 'case', 'took', 'conviction', 'three', 'local', 'teenagers', 'presumed', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'satanic', 'worship', 'real', 'life', 'movie', ""n't"", 'present', 'easy', 'answers', 'Suspicions', 'continue', 'float', 'as', 'complicated', 'pattern', 'curls', 'eddies', 'taken', 'actual', 'stream', 'where', 'boys', 'bodies', 'were', 'found.The', 'film', 'generally', 'low-key', 'approach', 'shocking', 'nonetheless', 'course', 'shock', 'murders', 'then', 'shocking', 'see', 'how', 'readily', 'town', 'people', 'settle', 'first', 'answer', 'way', 'implicating', '34', 'Goth', '34', 'kids', 'town', 'So', 'eager', 'are', 'most', 'people', 'resolution', 'accept', 'what', 'immediately', 'be', 'most', 'obvious', 'answer', 'then', 'hysterically', 'defend', 'position', 'even', 'more', 'complicating', 'evidence', 'light', 'close', 'being', 'study', 'mob', 'vengeance.The', 'biggest', 'shock', 'film', 'seeing', 'how', 'further', 'clues', 'point', 'possibility', 'guilt', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'town', 'people', 'who', 'surface', 'seemed', 'be', 'good', 'upstanding', 'citizens', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'be', 'case', 'so', 'many', 'high', 'profile', 'cases', 'out', 'sorts', 'local', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'leading', 'angry', 'deranged', 'lives', 'faade', 'backyard', 'barbecue', 'normalcy', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'true', 'crime', 'accounts', 'reveal', 'tangled', 'far-flung', 'skeins', 'motive', 'always', 'ever', 'shocking', 'encounter', 'such', 'widespread', 'malevolence', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'inclination', 'probe', 'further', 'case', 'movie', 'will', 'provide', 'good', 'intelligent', 'account', 'crime', 'surrounding', 'circumstances']",N/A

I think most of us early watchers are those familiar with the case and I think we want, if not closure, more of a point of view. I envision a film that shows a few of the possibilities as though they did happen, and then an investigator &#34;rewinding the film&#34; to poke holes into the the theories. There are no heroes in this movie. It even avoids the topic of Jesse not testifying against Damien and Jason.

1695234,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00J0IN6Z4,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","The story portrayed in Devil's Knot is the story of the West Memphis 3, a story I am very familiar with. Due to the heinous nature of the crime and the complete incompetence of the local police, the story garnered national attention and has been featured on every news show you can think of. There have also been a ton of documentaries made, all of which I've seen, and all of which call into question who might have really committed these acts. 1993, West Memphis Arkansas, three 8 year old boys go missing in the woods. A huge search party spends 3 days looking for them, before finding them in a popular fishing hole known as the Devil's Knot. There is a big list of suspects, but all the police can see is a group of Satan worshiping teenagers, who have long been a thorn in their sides. Through some very questionable tactics, and a sham of a trial, these teenagers were convicted and sent to prison. From the beginning, there involvement in the crime was called into question, even by the victims families, who saw the injustice of the whole procedure first hand. With my knowledge of the story, I was really interested to see how a film would handle the overwhelming amount of information associated with this case. To my surprise, they didn't do the typical thing and just focus on one aspect of the story, they made the case for the guilt of each of the suspects, and they showed how the police blindly and incompetently when after these three teenagers. As the film goes, they hit the nail right on the head, but when you have all these suspects, and so much back story, squeezed into an hour and a half, it can become extremely confusing for audiences unfamiliar with the case. The film is further harmed by all the interviews and investigation which really slow the pace down. The story of the West Memphis 3 is a tragic one that has led to the freedom of a killer, who did horrible things to three little boys. Devil's Knot is a primary example of police misconduct and the lack of justice available to the less fortunate. If you have an interest, I highly recommend you look into the story and decide for yourself, and a non-bias film covering the events is a great place to start.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1402790400,"06 15, 2014",2014,2195,"['story', 'portrayed', 'Devil', 'Knot', 'story', 'West', 'Memphis', '3', 'story', 'am', 'very', 'familiar', 'Due', 'heinous', 'nature', 'crime', 'complete', 'incompetence', 'local', 'police', 'story', 'garnered', 'national', 'attention', 'been', 'featured', 'news', 'show', 'can', 'think', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'ton', 'documentaries', 'made', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'call', 'question', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'really', 'committed', 'acts', '1993', 'West', 'Memphis', 'Arkansas', 'three', '8', 'year', 'old', 'boys', 'go', 'missing', 'woods', 'huge', 'search', 'party', '3', 'days', 'looking', 'finding', 'popular', 'fishing', 'hole', 'known', 'Devil', 'Knot', 'big', 'list', 'suspects', 'police', 'can', 'see', 'group', 'Satan', 'worshiping', 'teenagers', 'who', 'have', 'long', 'been', 'thorn', 'sides', 'very', 'questionable', 'tactics', 'sham', 'trial', 'teenagers', 'were', 'convicted', 'sent', 'prison', 'beginning', 'involvement', 'crime', 'was', 'called', 'question', 'even', 'victims', 'families', 'who', 'saw', 'injustice', 'whole', 'procedure', 'first', 'hand', 'knowledge', 'story', 'was', 'really', 'interested', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'would', 'handle', 'overwhelming', 'amount', 'information', 'associated', 'case', 'surprise', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'typical', 'thing', 'just', 'focus', 'one', 'aspect', 'story', 'made', 'case', 'guilt', 'suspects', 'showed', 'how', 'police', 'blindly', 'incompetently', 'when', 'three', 'teenagers', 'film', 'hit', 'nail', 'right', 'head', 'when', 'have', 'suspects', 'so', 'much', 'back', 'story', 'squeezed', 'hour', 'half', 'can', 'become', 'extremely', 'confusing', 'audiences', 'unfamiliar', 'case', 'film', 'further', 'harmed', 'interviews', 'investigation', 'really', 'slow', 'pace', 'down', 'story', 'West', 'Memphis', '3', 'tragic', 'one', 'led', 'freedom', 'killer', 'who', 'did', 'horrible', 'things', 'three', 'little', 'boys', 'Devil', 'Knot', 'primary', 'example', 'police', 'misconduct', 'lack', 'justice', 'available', 'less', 'fortunate', 'have', 'interest', 'highly', 'recommend', 'look', 'story', 'decide', 'non-bias', 'film', 'covering', 'events', 'great', 'place', 'start']",N/A

This is the story of the trial and how Ron Lax (Firth) tried to help the defense and how one of the mother's (Witherspoon) dealt with the loss and aftermath. I knew very little of the actual story going in. This is a movie that reminded me of the Aviator in the way that I watched a documentary and read more about the events after it was over and found those to be better and more interesting then the movie.

1695236,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B00J0IN6Z4,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[24, 31]","The story of the West Memphis Three has garnered a ton of media attention over the last two decades, and for good reason. It's a classic mix of elements that attract news outlets like bees to honey: murder, satanic cults, corruption, miscarriages of justice, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Since the murdered bodies of three young boys were discovered in an Alabama creek twenty years ago, the case has become a &#34;cause celebre&#34; due to the apparent false imprisonment of accused murderers Damien Echols, Jessie Misskelley Jr. and Jason Baldwin, seemingly railroaded by a system and town swept up in hysterics. The story was chronicled fully in three incredible Paradise Lost documentaries and the Peter Jackson-produced West of Memphis, leaving little room for Atom Egoyan's narrative feature Devil's Knot to forge its own path.Given the wealth of material already out there about the West Memphis Three case, Egoyan's decision to take on a dramatic interpretation of events is a mystery. It's a no-win scenario if there ever was one. Get it right and people will say the film basically wrote itself; get it wrong and you get Devil's Knot, which is flimsy, unnecessary, and manages to turn a compelling true story into something dull.There doesn't seem to be much that co-writers Scott Derrickson (of Sinister fame) and Paul Boardman have done other than take what we already know and get A-listers like Reese Witherspoon and Colin Firth to reenact it. Witherspoon takes on the role of Pam Hobbs, who one normal day in 1993 allows her son Steve to go out and play with his friends, warning him to be back in time for her to get to work. But when the boy doesn't show up, it begins a firestorm of rage and accusations that consume this small, devout Southern town. Not that you really get a sense of all that as the film focuses mainly on Hobbs and Colin Firth as southern investigator Ron Lax, who Damien Echols described as a bit player in the whole ordeal. Actually, Echols has been pretty open in his disdain for the movie and it's pretty easy to see why. In overly sentimental, movie-of-the-week fashion it skips over crucial details in the case; particularly troubling when one thinks how a lack of attention to detail is largely what doomed Echols, Jessie Misskelley, and Jason Baldwin to serve years behind bars for a crime they likely didn't commit.And so what we get is a thumbnail version of events and the players involved. Firth's Lax is particularly underserved, and the actor struggles to find anything to do with him. If he's truly &#34;obsessed&#34; over the case and making sure the accused go free, then why don't we ever see that passion? Instead we get characters, including the usually-amazing Amy Ryan as his ex-wife, talking at us about it. We get such an idealized, perfectly home-spun version of Hobbs that Witherspoon is left with nothing to do but be sad. There's a lot more to Hobbs' part of this story than this film is willing to portray, and the same goes for her skeevy husband Terry Hobbs (Alessandro Nivola), who in reality DNA evidence fingers as being involved in the murders. But the film tip-toes around that issue and in anything that steers too far away from a narrow and incomplete narrative that only encompass a small piece of a much larger canvas. Dane DeHaan is sorely wasted as a key witness, joined by other top actors who flit in and out without leaving much impact; Mireille Enos, Kevin Durand, Stephen Moyer, and Bruce Greenwood among others. Each of their characters is as thinly drawn as the dubious circumstances surrounding the police investigation, which was driven by religious zealotry, political gamesmanship, and flat-out ignorance.There just doesn't seem to be much of a reason for this film to exist. It literally says nothing new and what it does say is poorly executed. The film ends with a lousy update that tells us everything that happened with the case over the years, but it only serves to highlight how unfinished Devil's Knot truly is.
