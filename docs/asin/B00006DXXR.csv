A reality show that as it went on, the people portrayed went from every day people to epic characters worthly of the greatest fiction. This was the first year of MTV's The Real World, therefore what you see is not fake, staged or as in other seasons, knowing that the more drama and fighting we saw, the better. This goes completely the opposite. Sure, there are heated arguments but the people here are struggling with the camera not embracing it like other shows or seasons. I have had this on tape for almost ten years now and I rushed out and got the dvd. My only problem is because MTV could not get the rights to any of the original music, it used hack instrumental music over the proceedings. Part of the power of the piece was watching these people struggle with the day to dayness of their lives while the music of the time dictated that mood, chaos and love expressed here. Music like Guns and Roses, Metallica and many others are sorely missed and as wonderful as this collection is, something is missing. I wish this could be released complete.People or shall I say epic characters like Julie, Becky, Eric, Kevin, Andre, Heather and Norm deserve so much better.",4,A WONDERFUL EPIC ADVENTURE OF YOUNG LIFE BUT...,1032912000,"09 25, 2002",2002,1248,"['Whe', 'first', 'aired', 'MTV', 'showed', 'something', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'reality', 'show', 'went', 'people', 'portrayed', 'went', 'day', 'people', 'epic', 'characters', 'worthly', 'greatest', 'fiction', 'was', 'first', 'year', 'MTV', 'Real', 'World', 'therefore', 'what', 'see', 'not', 'fake', 'staged', 'other', 'seasons', 'knowing', 'more', 'drama', 'fighting', 'saw', 'better', 'completely', 'opposite', 'Sure', 'are', 'heated', 'arguments', 'people', 'here', 'are', 'struggling', 'camera', 'not', 'embracing', 'other', 'shows', 'seasons', 'have', 'had', 'tape', 'almost', 'ten', 'years', 'now', 'rushed', 'out', 'got', 'dvd', 'only', 'problem', 'MTV', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'rights', 'original', 'music', 'used', 'hack', 'instrumental', 'music', 'proceedings', 'Part', 'power', 'piece', 'was', 'watching', 'people', 'struggle', 'day', 'dayness', 'lives', 'music', 'time', 'dictated', 'mood', 'chaos', 'love', 'expressed', 'here', 'Music', 'Guns', 'Roses', 'Metallica', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'sorely', 'missed', 'as', 'wonderful', 'collection', 'something', 'missing', 'wish', 'could', 'be', 'released', 'complete.People', 'shall', 'say', 'epic', 'characters', 'Julie', 'Becky', 'Eric', 'Kevin', 'Andre', 'Heather', 'Norm', 'deserve', 'so', 'much', 'better']",N/A
712510,A3JM7ZRLXC18UC,B00006DXXR,Church of The Flaming Sword,"[5, 24]","Isn't eMpTyV grand?  It wasn't enough for them to simply ostracize music with genuine artistic merit and replace it the intellectually genocidal Gen-X/Gangsta culture.  It wasn't enough for them to force their cavalcade of no-talents like Britney Spears, Fred Durst, Eminem, and 50 Cent onto an unwilling public.  And it certainly wasn't enough for them to crush the dreams of tens of thousands of gifted musicians who poured their lives into their art.  They had to go and ruin television by introducing the ""reality"" (I don't associate anything pertaining to the real world to these shows) show in 1992 as well.So many people think that it all began in 2000 with Mark Burnett's unspeakably awful celebration of backstabbing and misanthropy known as Survivor.  No, it began with The Real World, which has as much to do with the real world as Kim Jong-Il does with human decency.  The premise is simple. Take seven young and attractive people (Heaven forbid you have anyone old or ugly), move them into a posh apartment in a low-crime section of a major city, and videotape every detail of their lives - or at least the details that get ratings.TRW is not the ""engaging study of human nature"" that its apologists make it out to be.  It is the foundation upon which dreck like The Apprentice, Joe Millionaire, and Survivor are built.  The only thing creative about these shows are the ways in which their participants will sink to elicit a reaction or to reach their goals.Speaking of being creative, I have a message for all of those who watch reality shows who are reading my review right now.  The time you are wasting watching such garbage could be spent doing something constructive.  Read a book.  Play a game of Scrabble.  Visit you loved ones.  Help John McCain bring about an end to the steroid problem in Major League Baseball.  Write a letter to Congress urging floggings to those who send ""Work at Home"" spam.  Start a petition asking for the FCC to place an indecency fine against the national tragedy known as Donald Trump's hair.  Or just take a nap.

Their solution? Find 7 beautiful, young, emotionally unstable people, lock them in an apartment for 4 months with an unlimited supply of alcohol, and see what happens. Was this a cheap, dastardly move by MTV that required no talent at all? Yup. Are the results easy to predict? Of course. But is it entertaining as hell? Absolutely! So much so that this formula has worked without gimmicks for 14 straight seasons and inspired dozens, if not hundreds, of imitations. Survivor lasted only 4 seasons before it got gimmicky, so that's really quite a tribute to the brilliant simplicity of the show's design.

But beware... although everything you've seen involving Norm, Heather, Julie, Eric, Becky, Andre', and Kevin is here- the music has been rescored.  I'm sure that getting the home video rights to all of the songs that were used when the show was originally aired would have been a logistical nightmare.  If you want to relive Norm, Heather, and Julie roller skating to Cece Peniston's &quot;Finally&quot;, you aren't going to see it here.  You'll see them skating, and you'll see their lips moving to a song, but what you'll hear is some generic, instrumental song instead.  If you want to relive Eric's ex-girlfriend Missy coming to visit him to the tune of Prince's &quot;Diamonds And Pearls&quot;... again, you're not going to see it on this DVD collection!  The scene is there but the music is not.Rescoring music for home video release has long been commonplace in the video industry.  &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; (the 1980's Molly Ringwald flick) had about half of its theatrical music deleted and replaced when it made it to video.  The difference between that and this is that the &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; video packaging offered a disclaimer: &quot;Some of the music has been changed from the original theatrical version.&quot;  There is no disclaimer on the &quot;Real World&quot; packaging.  This is quite misleading.If you can get past that (and I must admit... it does make a difference. The tone of the show has been changed somewhat, but it's still entertaining nontheless), you'll love this collection.  The original pilot (featuring a different group of 7 strangers) is included, as well as a copy of Julie's acceptance letter.  That is quite an interesting read for any &quot;Real World&quot; fan.  The only thing that would have made this collection even better would have been commentary from the cast.  Even if they couldn't have got the entire cast (Andre' has only been back for one reunion show), it would have been really interesting.  Some outtakes and bloopers would have made nice extra goodies as well.All in all... a decent collection for fans.

Each succesive RW has inevitably reflected the time it takes place (notice the succesive tolerance of class, race, sexuality from then to the new seasons).
