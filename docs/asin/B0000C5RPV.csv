773607,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B0000C5RPV,calvinnme,"[10, 11]","In my opinion, season three, the first full season of Homicide, was the best. The ratings had been anemic in seasons one and two, so that it was often called during that time ""the best TV show you're not watching"". Hoping to improve ratings, NBC insisted on a number of changes, both cosmetic and thematic. Unfortunately, talented but unphotogenic veteran actor Jon Polito was ordered dropped from the cast as the network clamored for more on-screen romance and violence. In order to have episodes the network considered more sensational air during ""sweeps"" periods, NBC sometimes aired episodes out of order, often to the detriment of story arcs that had developed over several episodes. Probably the most infamous of such gaffes during this season was NBC's decision to broadcast an episode featuring the program's first sex scene (""A Model Citizen"") prior to the airing of the much acclaimed episode, ""Crosetti""; it was in this latter hour that the death of Detective Steve Crosetti, Jon Polito's character, was revealed and explained. The detective had been in Atlantic City on vacation since the end of the second season's four episodes. For reasons never fully explained or understood, especially considering Crosetti's deep religious beliefs mentioned on the show during the first two seasons, he returns to Baltimore and kills himself rather than return to his job. As a result of this deviation from the producers' intended order, viewers of ""A Model Citizen"" found out from a comment made by his ex-partner, detective Meldrick Lewis, merely that Crosetti had died but not how or when. Fortunately, the DVD set remedies this and has the episodes in the order they were intended to be aired.This season also featured a trilogy of episodes (""The City That Bleeds,"" ""Dead End,"" and ""End Game"") in which three detectives are seriously wounded as a result of a gunman's ambush, two of them almost fatally; meanwhile, the rest of the unit grapples with this reminder of their own mortality as they hunt for the perpetrator. What makes it even worse - if that is possible - is that the detectives were at a completely wrong address at the time of the shooting due to an administrative typo on the arrest warrant. These ""cliffhanger"" episodes were intended to cause the network execs to decide to let Homicide finish out its season, in spite of its ratings, and they did the trick.Isabella Hoffmann is added to the cast this year as the new night shift commander, Megan Russert. Although she was added by the network for all the wrong reasons - to ""pretty up"" the cast - she is an outstanding actress and a welcome addition throughout her tenure. Russert misses detective work, though, and in the Christmas episode ""All Through the House"" she joins Meldrick on an investigation into the murder of a material witness when she discovers she knows something about the victim's case. During this same episode Munch and Bolander investigate the death of a man in a Santa Claus suit and Munch spends the evening with a child they believe is the victim's son. Munch is trying to hide from the boy what he believes is his father's fate, but is finally about to tell him what he thinks has happened when Bolander returns with the boy's father, bruised but OK. It turns out that the murder victim had mugged the boy's father and stolen his Santa suit only to be mugged and murdered himself later that night.In one of the series' best season finales, ""Gas Man"", Bruno Kirby stars as a recently released ex-con who is out to kill detective Frank Pembleton (Andre Braugher) because he had helped lock him up years ago. Kirby plays a loser who, years ago, had falsely claimed to be a qualified repairman so that he could earn a few quick bucks by repairing a gas heater. His faulty repair work causes an explosion and the death of the family whose heater he repaired, and he is angry that he was made a ""test case"" and tried and convicted of the family's deaths. At the end of the show his plan of revenge has seemed to work out, and he is ready to murder Frank, but ultimately he is all talk and cannot go through with it. The final line of the episode, delivered by Pembleton, is typical of his Shakespearean musings. He is told that he is lucky that the ex-con did not kill him. He responds by saying ""Luck had nothing to do with it. God reached down and graced a fool with wisdom."" Ultimately, we never know if Frank is talking about himself-for how he handles himself in the situation, or the ex-con for realizing that killing Frank will solve nothing.These episodes are typical of the high quality drama, often with a sense of irony, you'll experience in this third season of Homicide. So, if you liked seasons one and two, I know you'll love this one too. Highly recommended.P.S. I am reviewing season three here because I have the room to go into details. However, if you already know you like the entire series, seasons 1-7 are now selling as a package set on Amazon for about $350. This will give you considerable savings over buying the seasons one at a time.",5,Best season of TV's best crime drama ever,1142121600,"03 12, 2006",2006,5057,"['opinion', 'season', 'three', 'first',

Kutinsky ""ekutinsky""","[8, 10]","When I first caught the season 3 episodes of Homicide: Life on the Street, I thought it was the second coming of the drama series, unlike anything I'd seen.  Now, more than a decade after its airing, I'm not so sure that's true - it's far more conventional than I ever gave it credit for.  Plotlines like Russert's discovery of her ex-partner's spousal abuse (""Partners""), the watering-down of dark/light-skinned African American racism a la Spike Lee's School Daze (""Nothing Personal"") or the lame Frank-vs.-beauracracy plotline (""Cradle to Grave"") all seem to come out of the affecting-social-melodrama handbook.  It means, I think, that Homicide hadn't quite come into its own yet, not in the sure and galvanizing way it did in seasons 4-6.  Perhaps it was still unsure of what to do with the fact that it had accidnetally stumbled onto one of the best performances in the history of television in Andre Braugher, and felt the need to set him off as much as possible.  Or perhaps it was a need to give their most recognizable face, Daniel Baldwin, more screentime (who could care about the Beth-kids debacle plotline?).  Some episodes are rightly considered classics - like the devastating ""Every Mother's Son"" and the gorgeous send-off ""Crosseti,"" which features work of magestic grief and strength by both Ned Beatty and Clark Johnson.  Those episodes prove that Homicide was on the right track, but I disagree with most fans that think it had already entered its glory days - the best were ahead.",4,"Excellent, but not quite as good as you remember",1109980800,"03 5, 2005",2005,1502,"['When', 'first', 'caught', 'season', '3', 'episodes', 'Homicide', 'Life', 'Street', 'thought', 'was', 'second', 'coming', 'drama', 'series', 'anything', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Now', 'more', 'decade', 'airing', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'true', 'far', 'more', 'conventional', 'ever', 'gave', 'credit', 'Plotlines', 'Russert', 'discovery', 'ex-partner', 'spousal', 'abuse', 'Partners', 'watering-down', 'dark/light-skinned', 'African', 'American', 'racism', 'la', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'School', 'Daze', 'Nothing', 'Personal', 'lame', 'Frank-vs.-beauracracy', 'plotline', 'Cradle', 'Grave', 'seem', 'come', 'affecting-social-melodrama', 'handbook', 'think', 'Homicide', 'had', ""n't"", 'quite', 'come', 'own', 'yet', 'not', 'sure', 'galvanizing', 'way', 'did', 'seasons', '4-6', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'still', 'unsure', 'what', 'do', 'fact', 'had', 'accidnetally', 'stumbled', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'history', 'television', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'felt', 'need', 'set', 'off', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'perhaps', 'was', 'need', 'give', 'most', 'recognizable', 'face', 'Daniel', 'Baldwin', 'more', 'screentime', 'who', 'could', 'care', 'Beth-kids', 'debacle', 'plotline', 'episodes', 'are', 'rightly', 'considered', 'classics', 'devastating', 'Mother', 'Son', 'gorgeous', 'send-off', 'Crosseti', 'work', 'magestic', 'grief', 'strength', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'Clark', 'Johnson', 'episodes', 'prove', 'Homicide', 'was', 'right', 'track', 'disagree', 'most', 'fans', 'think', 'had', 'already', 'entered', 'glory', 'days', 'best', 'were', 'ahead']",N/A
773610,A73DFWJE0CGY6,B0000C5RPV,"Flight Risk (The Gypsy Moth) ""Exiled Yankee""","[3, 3]","Hands down, this is the primo TV police series of all time - and please believe me when I say I know whereof I speak. Everything about this series - the somewhat run-down, out-of-date precinct house, the squabbles over cases - even the lunch thefts from the community refridgerator - all ring true and fresh. Al Giardello (Yaphet Kotto) presides over a squadroom of detectives who are prickly, proud, argumentative - but dogged in their pursuits of homicide perpetrators. They squabble ceaselessly amongst themselves, they engage in collaborations outside the scope of the squadroom - both romantic and financial, in the case of joint ownership of a local bar - they complain about the job; they complain about each other; but they club together like a dysfunctional but secretly adoring family. It's clear that all of them harbour enormous respect for Giardello, whom they all refer to as ""Gee"", and he deals with each of them with sometimes simmering forebearance (and in one case with gleeful deceit, taking Bayliss (Kyle Secor) for just about everything in a marathon game of Hearts during a lull in work).This was my favourite season in a stellar series. By Year Three, the personalities were set and familiar, and in the opening episode had suffered the first casualty in the lineup when veteran detective Crosetti was found drowned. His ex-partner, Meldrick Lewis (Clark Johnson), had to come to terms with his death, and you truly feel sorry for Lewis's painful final acceptance.The unusual style of filming of this series - hand-held cameras, repetitive shots of the same two-second scene, for emphasis on a plot point - was unsettling at times but riveting in its ability to catch your attention. The overall reality of the characters made it impossible for me to have a favourite amongst the cast, as each one shines at unexpected moments, but the most memorable to me are Yaphet Kotto as Giardello and Andre Braugher as Frank Pembleton, a mercurial, driven, intense detective known for his ability to get criminals to fess up. Ned Beatty, who plays out-of-shape, constantly-cranky Bolander, an old-school detective nearing retirement, always brings something special to the role. John Munch (Richard Belzer) plays his role with wit and sarcasm, sardonically regarding the world with a very jaundiced and jaded eye. Meldrick Lewis (Clark Johnson), a perpetual whiner, suffers the fate of no one wanting to partner with him and goes through life looking slightly baffled and injured. Kay Howard (the great Melissa Leo), the squad's only female detective up to this point always ensures that she is more than ready to keep up with the boys, and the point is made in Season Three that she has the best record for closing cases in the whole squad. The loose cannon in the group is Beau Felton (Daniel Baldwin - the Baldwins are everywhere), who brings his personal problems with him to work and adds to them by carrying on an affair with a superior officer, Megan Russert (Isabella Hofmann). We learn a lot about the detective's lives outside the squadroom in Season Three - in one particularly memorable episode, a burned-out Kay Howard takes vacation time and drives home to the Chesapeake, landing in the middle of small-town, know-everybody trauma, which just shows that you can't run away from your regular life. Tim Bayliss (Kyle Secor), the newest member of the squad, always seems a trifle off-balance, never really sure of himself in the scope of the group, and never sure of his standing with his partner, Pembleton - a man who would sooner go without any partner at all.The character development, plots, acting, and edgy realism in this series is unsurpassed, then and now. The show unfortunately didn't glean a high Nielsen rating (it was stuck in the echoing hole of Friday night, when most people with social lives are not home watching TV)but probably much to my own social detriment, I rarely missed an episode, and the critics showered praise upon it. It certainly portrays police work well - many times I marvelled at the fact that politics seems to be pervasive throughout the police world, as people in the show are denied promotions almost purely on a punitive basis, and others are promoted because it's politically - and demographically - correct.Never a boring moment here; never a bad job of acting. There are several droll cameos - Tim Russert, briefly, and one intro crossover with Chris Noth of Law And Order delivering John Waters to Baltimore as a captured fugitive - and I have to say that the scriptwriting is possibly the best on TV, at least of its genre.",5,"Gritty, realistic, well-written police drama",1201392000,"01 27, 2008",2008,4596,"['Hands', 'down', 'primo', 'TV', 'police', 'series', 'time', 'please', 'believe', 'when', 'say', 'know', 'whereof', 'speak', 'Everything', 'series', 'somewhat', 'run-down', 'out-of-date', 'precinct', 'house', 'squabbles', 'cases', 'even', 'lunch', 'thefts', 'community', 'refridgerator', 'ring', 'true', 'fresh', 'Al', 'Giardello', 'Yaphet', 'Kotto', 'squadroom', 'detectives', 'who', 'are', 'prickly', 'proud', 'argumentative', 'dogged', 'pursuits', 'homicide', 'perpetrators', 'squabble', 'ceaselessly', 'amongst', 'engage', 'collaborations', 'scope', 'squadroom', 'romantic', 'financial', 'case', 'joint', 'ownership', 'local', 'bar', 'complain', 'job', 'complain', 'other', 'club', 'together', 'dysfunctional', 'secretly', 'adoring', 'family', 'clear', 'harbour', 'enormous', 'respect', 'Giardello', 'whom', 'refer', 'Gee', 'sometimes', 'simmering', 'forebearance', 'one', 'case', 'gleeful', 'deceit', 'taking', 'Bayliss', 'Kyle', 'Secor', 'just', 'everything', 'marathon', 'game', 'Hearts', 'lull', 'work', '.This', 'was', 'favourite', 'season', 'stellar', 'series', 'Year', 'Three', 'personalities', 'were', 'set', 'familiar', 'opening', 'episode', 'had', 'suffered', 'first', 'casualty', 'lineup', 'when', 'veteran', 'detective', 'Crosetti', 'was', 'found', 'drowned', 'ex-partner', 'Meldrick', 'Lewis', 'Clark', 'Johnson', 'had', 'come', 'terms', 'death', 'truly', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Lewis', 'painful', 'final', 'acceptance.The', 'unusual', 'style', 'filming', 'series', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'repetitive', 'shots', 'same', 'two-second', 'scene', 'emphasis', 'plot', 'point', 'was', 'unsettling', 'times', 'riveting', 'ability', 'catch', 'attention', 'overall', 'reality', 'characters', 'made', 'impossible', 'have', 'favourite', 'amongst', 'cast', 'one', 'shines', 'unexpected', 'moments', 'most', 'memorable', 'are', 'Yaphet', 'Kotto', 'Giardello', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'Frank', 'Pembleton', 'mercurial', 'driven', 'intense', 'detective', 'known', 'ability', 'get', 'criminals', 'fess', 'up', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'who', 'out-of-shape', 'constantly-cranky', 'Bolander', 'old-school', 'detective', 'nearing', 'retirement', 'always', 'something', 'special', 'role', 'John', 'Munch', 'Richard', 'Belzer', 'role', 'wit', 'sarcasm', 'sardonically', 'regarding', 'world', 'very', 'jaundiced', 'jaded', 'eye', 'Meldrick', 'Lewis', 'Clark', 'Johnson', 'perpetual', 'whiner', 'fate', 'one', 'wanting', 'partner', 'life', 'looking', 'slightly', 'baffled', 'injured', 'Kay', 'Howard', 'great', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'squad', 'only', 'female', 'detective', 'up', 'point', 'always', 'more', 'ready', 'keep', 'up', 'boys', 'point', 'made', 'Season', 'Three', 'best', 'record', 'closing', 'cases', 'whole', 'squad', 'loose', 'cannon', 'group', 'Beau', 'Felton', 'Daniel', 'Baldwin', 'Baldwins', 'are', 'everywhere', 'who', 'personal', 'problems', 'work', 'carrying', 'affair', 'superior', 'officer', 'Megan', 'Russert', 'Isabella', 'Hofmann', 'learn', 'lot', 'detective', 'lives', 'squadroom', 'Season', 'Three', 'one', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'episode', 'burned-out', 'Kay', 'Howard', 'vacation', 'time', 'home', 'Chesapeake', 'landing', 'middle', 'small-town', 'know-everybody', 'trauma', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'run', 'away', 'regular', 'life', 'Tim', 'Bayliss', 'Kyle', 'Secor', 'newest', 'member', 'squad', 'always', 'trifle', 'off-balance', 'never', 'really', 'sure', 'scope', 'group', 'never', 'sure', 'standing', 'partner', 'Pembleton', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'sooner', 'go', 'partner', 'all.The', 'character', 'development', 'plots', 'acting', 'edgy', 'realism', 'series', 'unsurpassed', 'then', 'now', 'show', 'unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'glean', 'high', 'Nielsen', 'rating', 'was', 'stuck', 'echoing', 'hole', 'Friday', 'night', 'when', 'most', 'people', 'social', 'lives', 'are', 'not', 'home', 'watching', 'TV', 'probably', 'much', 'own', 'social', 'detriment', 'rarely', 'missed', 'episode', 'critics', 'showered', 'praise', 'certainly', 'police', 'work', 'well', 'many', 'times', 'marvelled', 'fact', 'politics', 'be', 'pervasive', 'police', 'world', 'people', 'show', 'are', 'denied', 'promotions', 'almost', 'purely', 'punitive', 'basis', 'others', 'are', 'promoted', 'politically', 'demographically', 'correct.Never', 'boring', 'moment', 'here', 'never', 'bad', 'job', 'acting', 'are', 'several', 'droll', 'cameos', 'Tim', 'Russert', 'briefly', 'one', 'intro', 'crossover', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'Law', 'Order', 'delivering', 'John', 'Waters', 'Baltimore', 'captured', 'fugitive', 'have', 'say', 'scriptwriting', 'possibly', 'best', 'TV', 'least', 'genre']",N/A

773612,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,B0000C5RPV,Jason A. Miller,"[47, 49]","A full season of &quot;Homicide&quot; must have seemed strange in the fall of 1994.  In the previous 18 months, NBC aired just 13 episodes of the show, in what seemed to be 13 different time slots.  Oddly enough, even though I lived in Baltimore at the time, I didn't watch a single moment of the series -- I didn't come to it until years later, when nearly half the original cast was gone, and when I had long since forsaken Charm City for the American gothic of Toledo, Ohio.It's an absolute treasure having this show on DVD now, available at my beck and call.  While the Seasons 1/2 box set did not last very long, I worked my way methodically through the 20 episodes of Season 3.  What was so important about my senior year of college that I was not watching this show on Friday nights?The producers put their agenda right on the table in the season premiere.  &quot;Homicide&quot; in its earlier episodes established itself as the cop show with no gunfights and no car chases.  The character with the most active social life in those years was rotund Stan Bolander (Ned Beatty).  The teaser for the Season 3 premiere (which, as was the norm, featured some of the detectives' best bickering and bantering) features Munch (Richard Belzer) ridiculing a TV soap opera.  The episode then ends with the revelation that Detective Felton (Daniel Baldwin) has been carrying on a torrid affair with newly-appointed Lieutenant Russert (Isabella Hoffmann).However, even that change in the show's game plan was not a brain-dead concession to network standards.  The opening three-episode arc also features infrequent glimpses of Felton's weird, child-like wife, and pulls the plug on the affair.  Center stage in these three episodes is Frank Pembleton (Emmy-winning Andre Braugher) and his crisis of faith after a series of religious-inspired murders.The cast change for Season 3 featured the unfortunate exit of Jon Polito, whose Detective Crosetti (the Lincoln assassination conspiracy theorist) was a signature character the first two years.  However, he's not just pushed aside without explanation.  Crosetti's suicide lingers over the squadroom for half the year, with two entire episodes devoted to the aftermath of his death.  &quot;Crosetti&quot;, the episode where Bolander and Munch fish his body from the Chesapeake, features a tour-de-force performance by Clark Johnson as Detective Lewis, Crosetti's partner, trying to come to grips with the news.Yaphet Kotto replaces Crosetti as the show's signature character -- someone you wouldn't find anywhere else on television.  The African-American police lieutenant who played by the book was already an ancient TV cliche by the time &quot;Homicide&quot; came along.  Kotto (and the writers) actually did something with this stereotype.  Here we see Kotto not just threatening his detectives (Felton), but laughing at them, too (Bayliss and Munch).  He plays politics with his superiors, and loses his cool when he's a victim of skin-tone racism.  And, best of all, on one Sunday morning (&quot;Last of the Watermen&quot;), he runs into Munch in a city laundromat.  And ignores him.Other notable episodes:-&quot;Every Mother's Son&quot;, where Pembleton investigates the death of a teen at the hands of another teen.  Never a show to settle for typical right-wing cop show sentiment, &quot;Homicide&quot; instead shows how the mothers (accidentally) befriend each other.-&quot;The City that Bleeds&quot;, the start of a three-episode run detailing the shootings of Bolander, Felton and Howard.-&quot;End Game&quot;, or The One with Steve Buscemi.  Second only to &quot;Three Men and Adena&quot; (Season 1) for Pembleton's best interrogation in The Box.-&quot;All Through the House&quot;.  It's Christmas in Baltimore.  Bolander gets overly pious over the squadroom tree, Bayliss tries to hustle Giardello at a game of hearts, and Munch has to babysit with the precocious son of a slain street-corner Santa Claus.-&quot;A Model Citizen&quot;.  Everyone gets something to do, from Bayliss's creepy romance with crime-scene artist Emma Zoole, to Munch's efforts at taking an alcohol-awareness class, to Felton receiving more bad news about his marrage.  &quot;Homicide&quot; was always noteworthy for its use of alternative and hip-hop music on the soundtrack.  This one ends with &quot;Hurt&quot;, years before Johnny Cash made it cool again.-&quot;The Gas Man&quot;.  The season (and, at the time, nearly the series) finale, focusses entirely on Bruno Kirby as a released convict stalking Pembleton.  The DVD also features commentary by writer Henry Bromell and director Barry Levinson.

The results are still interesting to watch in this DVD set.  From the introduction of new shift commander Russert (Isabella Hoffman) to the unexpected loss of one of their own (done in a truly powerful way in one of the best episodes of that season), the third season had some major upheavals and even tighter storylines for its main characters.  And the stories were crisp and powerful, ranging from the intense manhunt for a serial killer in the season premiere; the chilling ""Every Mother's Son"", in which a young boy is the suspect in another boy's death; and the season ender, ""The Gas Man"", as a released convict seeks revenge against the detective who put him away.  As usual, the cast is exceptional, mangaing to ellicit heartwrenching emotion and even gallows humor out of the most bizarre situations.  If you course loved the previous release of the first two seasons, this one should be a no-brainer.

773616,AK7IDQJN31163,B0000C5RPV,Ryan,"[69, 71]","The first two seasons of Homicide were great television.  The third season surpassed the first two and cemented this police drama as one of the best ever on network television.  Although NBC buried it in the Friday night graveyard and ratings were always low, we were still given superior writing, acting and production quality on a consistent basis.  This dvd set contains a season of the same character-driven stories that makes Homicide what it is, but the plotting became a bit more tightly woven as compared to the previous seasons.  The show starts out with the addition of LT. Megan Russert (Isabella Hofmann) as a new shift commander who must deal with a series of murders after only a week on the job.  The White Glove Murders would be the first of two three-part stories during the season.  They would also test Frank Pembleton's faith in God and humanity; a theme that would recur throughout the rest of his time on the series.  We're treated to some touching and heartbreaking moments as well in such episodes as ""Every Mother's Son,"" and ""All Through the House.""  Racial tensions flair in, ""Colors,"" as Pembleton and Bayliss clash when Tim's cousin shoots a Turkish exchange student on his front porch.  The best example comes when we watch Meldrick Lewis struggle to accept the death of his partner in, ""Crosetti.""  Many fans note the final scene of this episode as their all-time favorite from the series.  The other major three-part story involves the shooting of Kay Howard, Beau Felton and Stan Bolander.  The chase to track down the shooter is riveting and the final confrontation between Pembleton and a suspect in The Box is classic Homicide at its best.  Other story lines running throughout the season include Beau Felton's troubled marriage and the efforts of three of the detectives to buy and open the Waterfront Bar.  The original cast remains intact for this season, except for the departure of Jon Polito (Crosetti.)  Unfortunately, this would be the last season for Ned Beatty (Bolander) and Daniel Baldwin (Beau Felton) until their reappearance in the Homicide movie.As is the case with the previous dvd set, the sound is superior to that of the TV reruns and the picture quality is excellent.  The commentary on the episode, ""The Gas Man,"" is interesting and the bonus documentary was fun to watch for those of us who are diehard fans.  The music lists and visuals of the board are also nice bonuses.  One gets the feeling that the people putting this package together did some internet research along the way.  Its nice to see that the episodes are placed in the correct story order so that events would flow smoothly.  NBC wasn't so considerate when they aired the original series.  I was disappointed to find no ""play all"" feature and unlike the last season, chapter breaks are not available between episodes.  I'm also disappointed to find that A&E; didn't include the previouslies at the beginning of each episode.  Still, this is an excellent package and well worth the price.Episode List:*Nearer My God to Thee 1*Fits Like a Glove 2*Extreme Unction 3*Crosetti*The Last of the Watermen*A Model Citizen*Happy to be Here*All Through the House*Nothing Personal*Every Mother's Son*Cradle to Grave*Partners*The City That Bleeds 1*Dead End 2*End Game 3  (Guest star Steve Buscemi*Law and Disorder*The Old and the Dead*In Search of Crimes Past*Colors*The Gas Man  (Guest star Bruno Kirby)",5,"Homicide, The Best Gets Better",1067904000,"11 4, 2003",2003,3419,"['first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Homicide', 'were', 'great', 'television', 'third', 'season', 'surpassed', 'first', 'two', 'cemented', 'police', 'drama', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'network', 'television', 'NBC', 'buried', 'Friday', 'night', 'graveyard', 'ratings', 'were', 'always', 'low', 'were', 'still', 'given', 'superior', 'writing', 'acting', 'production', 'quality', 'consistent', 'basis', 'dvd', 'set', 'season', 'same', 'character-driven', 'stories', 'Homicide', 'what', 'plotting', 'became', 'bit', 'more', 'tightly', 'woven', 'compared', 'previous', 'seasons', 'show', 'out', 'addition', 'LT.', 'Megan', 'Russert', 'Isabella', 'Hofmann', 'new', 'shift', 'commander', 'who', 'must', 'deal', 'series', 'murders', 'only', 'week', 'job', 'White', 'Glove', 'Murders', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'two', 'three-part', 'stories', 'season', 'would', 'also', 'test', 'Frank', 'Pembleton', 'faith', 'God', 'humanity', 'theme', 'would', 'recur', 'rest', 'time', 'series', ""'re"", 'treated', 'touching', 'heartbreaking', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'episodes', 'Every', 'Mother', 'Son', 'House', 'Racial', 'tensions', 'flair', 'Colors', 'Pembleton', 'Bayliss', 'clash', 'when', 'Tim', 'cousin', 'shoots', 'Turkish', 'exchange', 'student', 'front', 'porch', 'best', 'example', 'when', 'watch', 'Meldrick', 'Lewis', 'struggle', 'accept', 'death', 'partner', 'Crosetti', 'Many', 'fans', 'note', 'final', 'scene', 'episode', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'series', 'other', 'major', 'three-part', 'story', 'shooting', 'Kay', 'Howard', 'Beau', 'Felton', 'Stan', 'Bolander', 'chase', 'track', 'down', 'shooter', 'riveting', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Pembleton', 'suspect', 'Box', 'classic', 'Homicide', 'best', 'Other', 'story', 'lines', 'running', 'season', 'include', 'Beau', 'Felton', 'troubled', 'marriage', 'efforts', 'three', 'detectives', 'buy', 'open', 'Waterfront', 'Bar', 'original', 'cast', 'intact', 'season', 'departure', 'Jon', 'Polito', 'Crosetti', 'Unfortunately', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'season', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'Bolander', 'Daniel', 'Baldwin', 'Beau', 'Felton', 'reappearance', 'Homicide', 'movie.As', 'case', 'previous', 'dvd', 'set', 'sound', 'superior', 'TV', 'reruns', 'picture', 'quality', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'episode', 'Gas', 'Man', 'interesting', 'bonus', 'documentary', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'who', 'are', 'diehard', 'fans', 'music', 'lists', 'visuals', 'board', 'are', 'also', 'nice', 'bonuses', 'One', 'feeling', 'people', 'putting', 'package', 'together', 'did', 'internet', 'research', 'way', 'nice', 'see', 'episodes', 'are', 'placed', 'correct', 'story', 'order', 'events', 'would', 'flow', 'smoothly', 'NBC', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'considerate', 'when', 'aired', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'disappointed', 'find', 'play', 'feature', 'last', 'season', 'chapter', 'breaks', 'are', 'not', 'available', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'also', 'disappointed', 'find', 'A', 'E', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'previouslies', 'beginning', 'episode', 'Still', 'excellent', 'package', 'well', 'price.Episode', 'List', '*Nearer', 'My', 'God', 'Thee', '1*Fits', 'Glove', '2*Extreme', 'Unction', '3*Crosetti*The', 'Last', 'Watermen*A', 'Model', 'Citizen*Happy', 'be', 'Here*All', 'House*Nothing', 'Personal*Every', 'Mother', 'Son*Cradle', 'Grave*Partners*The', 'City', 'That', '1*Dead', 'End', '2*End', 'Game', '3', 'Guest', 'star', 'Steve', 'Buscemi*Law', 'Disorder*The', 'Old', 'Dead*In', 'Search', 'Crimes', 'Past*Colors*The', 'Gas', 'Man', 'Guest', 'star', 'Bruno', 'Kirby']",N/A

However, when I watch it, I just think of the source material and how it became The Wire: The Complete Series and I weep for the missed opportunity. This is when the show takes its steps toward becomingLaw & Order - The Seventh Year, a better version of Law & Order, but still Law & Order. With all of its earnestness and MURDER IS BAD speechifying.For the most part, it's pretty good. Andre Braugher is intense. Belzer is funny and cranky. The rest of the squad have their individual stories. The murder cases stay away from the cliches of the master criminal and the Ripped from the Headlines (and spindled and mutilated and spit out). But there's no humor. There's no levity. Everyone becomes deadly serious. And while this is a show about Homicide Detectives, the fact that everyone is SO SERIOUS all the time makes for some tedious viewing.Of course, if you watch it in small doses, it's still brilliant. But watching it all at once and you get into these horrible loops where the detectives have to stop to talk about racism. Or the horribleness of murder. It's like that Robin Williams episode decided to cast a long dark shadow over the proceedings and everyone has to be as dour as a mortician. The show gets a little better towards the end and shows signs of experimentation (particularly the Bruno Kirby episode where it's all from his perspective) but it's still on its downward slide toward earnest seriousness.Now this would be a four star review, except I have The Wire for comparison. And when comparing a cop show to The Wire, there is never any comparison.",3,It's good but it's no Wire,1242518400,"05 17, 2009",2009,1645,"['According', 'many', 'season', 'when', 'show', 'came', 'own', 'However', 'when', 'watch', 'just', 'think', 'source', 'material', 'how', 'became', 'Wire', 'Complete', 'Series', 'weep', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'when', 'show', 'steps', 'becomingLaw', 'Order', 'Seventh', 'Year', 'better', 'version', 'Law', 'Order', 'still', 'Law', 'Order', 'earnestness', 'MURDER', 'IS', 'BAD', 'speechifying.For', 'most', 'part', 'pretty', 'good', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'intense', 'Belzer', 'funny', 'cranky', 'rest', 'squad', 'have', 'individual', 'stories', 'murder', 'cases', 'stay', 'away', 'cliches', 'master', 'criminal', 'Ripped', 'Headlines', 'spindled', 'mutilated', 'spit', 'out', 'humor', 'levity', 'Everyone', 'deadly', 'serious', 'show', 'Homicide', 'Detectives', 'fact', 'everyone', 'SO', 'SERIOUS', 'time', 'tedious', 'viewing.Of', 'course', 'watch', 'small', 'doses', 'still', 'brilliant', 'watching', 'once', 'get', 'horrible', 'loops', 'where', 'detectives', 'have', 'stop', 'talk', 'racism', 'horribleness', 'murder', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'episode', 'decided', 'cast', 'long', 'dark', 'shadow', 'proceedings', 'everyone', 'be', 'as', 'dour', 'mortician', 'show', 'little', 'better', 'end', 'signs', 'experimentation', 'particularly', 'Bruno', 'Kirby', 'episode', 'where', 'perspective', 'still', 'downward', 'slide', 'earnest', 'seriousness.Now', 'would', 'be', 'four', 'star', 'review', 'have', 'Wire', 'comparison', 'when', 'comparing', 'cop', 'show', 'Wire', 'never', 'comparison']",N/A
