1019785,A2T6JYWW64MMIN,B000ICLRFM,Natalie B,"[7, 7]","I laughed and cried while watching this DVD! The events leading up to the moment Dog & Beth get married, the things they have to go through to get to the alter. Having family by this is very important and when one of Dog's Daughters is sadly killed it shows how strong that family is. It shows how the pull together to continue on with the Wedding. Though it had its sad moments it reminds me of family unity.
