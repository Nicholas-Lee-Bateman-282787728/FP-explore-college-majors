First and foremost, the most egregious failing is also it's most unavoidable: casting a white, English-speaking protagonist to lead an otherwise all-Japanese cast. We all know why this is done, and it's awful, but let's not dwell on that right now. Keanu Reeves, while not being a great actor, would be totally fine in this kind of film, if his character weren't simply slapped on top of the existing story almost as an afterthought. He really plays no vital role in the tale of the samurai, and every element of his story could be removed without changing the trajectory of the plot. This does not make for a compelling or engaging main character.Not coincidentally, all of the supernatural elements added revolve around Reeves, and also feel like they exist in a vacuum. This doesn't feel like a magical world, and the characters don't behave like it is either. However, when they randomly encounter a mythical beast, cave filled with demon monks, or giant dragon, they act like it's no big deal. It's all very disjointed. The film would have been better served completely overhauling the original legend and going for full fledged fantasy, or staying far truer to the source material than they did. This muddled middle of the road approach fails two masters at the same time, creating a filmic ronin all its own.All this being said, the film is nowhere near as bad as most large scale action films these days, there's just so many wasted opportunities that you'll spend more time thinking about what could have been than what exists on the screen before you.",2,"Not as bad as advertised, but a real missed opportunity.",1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,1705,"['tale', '47', 'Ronin', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'legends', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'retelling', 'real', 'disservice', 'several', 'levels', 'First', 'foremost', 'most', 'egregious', 'failing', 'also', 'most', 'unavoidable', 'casting', 'white', 'English-speaking', 'protagonist', 'lead', 'otherwise', 'all-Japanese', 'cast', 'know', 'why', 'done', 'awful', 'let', 'not', 'dwell', 'right', 'now', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'not', 'being', 'great', 'actor', 'would', 'be', 'totally', 'fine', 'kind', 'film', 'character', 'were', ""n't"", 'simply', 'slapped', 'top', 'existing', 'story', 'almost', 'afterthought', 'really', 'vital', 'role', 'tale', 'samurai', 'element', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'removed', 'changing', 'trajectory', 'plot', 'not', 'make', 'compelling', 'engaging', 'main', 'character.Not', 'coincidentally', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'added', 'revolve', 'Reeves', 'also', 'feel', 'exist', 'vacuum', ""n't"", 'feel', 'magical', 'world', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'behave', 'either', 'However', 'when', 'randomly', 'encounter', 'mythical', 'beast', 'cave', 'filled', 'demon', 'monks', 'giant', 'dragon', 'act', 'big', 'deal', 'very', 'disjointed', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'completely', 'overhauling', 'original', 'legend', 'going', 'full', 'fledged', 'fantasy', 'staying', 'far', 'truer', 'source', 'material', 'did', 'muddled', 'middle', 'road', 'approach', 'two', 'masters', 'same', 'time', 'creating', 'filmic', 'ronin', 'own.All', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'bad', 'most', 'large', 'scale', 'action', 'films', 'days', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'wasted', 'opportunities', ""'ll"", 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'thinking', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'what', 'screen']",N/A

I could be a little biased seeing how I am a huge Keanu Reeves fan. He's not every ones cup of tea. On the bright side more Americans will learn about the story.

I guess the producers forgot about historical accuracy per  the subject matter and location.2. All the characters were very Westernized in their behavior.3. Cheap CGI of the beast appearing in the beginning of the film. Anatomically as incorrect as a movie made beast can be. All the spider like eyes were laughable as well as the pair of drop down horns. Hollywood imagination gone wild (must have spent too many hours doodling in science classes and not paying attention).4. The only other CGI of a flowing robe becoming a person or snake was artful but became tiresomely cutesy & redundant after being shown excessively over and over.5. Clothes, props and sets were Hollywood cheap; very synthetic plastic/polyester looking.6. Not up to the grandeur of Asian film with immense numbers of cast and authentic period pieces - very low budget.7. Emotions also were more Westernized such as the overly emphasized - jealousy. The producers, director and script writers must have been banking on American/European audiences to pay the bills thus the Western emphasis.8. Acting was robotic; especially the Reeves character with the constant stiff bowing and weak emulation of old TV samurai style shows.9.

When the 47's master is killed and the 47 become scattered, Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada) tracks down Kai (Keanu Reeves), a half-Japanese half-British warrior to help bring the 47 back together to fight Lord Kira and his army before all of Japan is lost.47 Ronin is actually a fantastic movie that got very poor reviews from critics because, well, it shares a lot with other movies like 300 and Immortals in terms of plot elements, but the film is much more intriguing, and has better action if you ask me. The script was good, but not anywhere near as good as it could have been. I'm just hoping they release an extended cut on disc because, well, they could easily add 15-20 minutes to the movie, as character development for the Witch (Rinko Kikuchi) was almost entirely absent. The directing was great, but with the editing, there were a few too many cut-away scenes. The acting was superb, especially from the two leads (Sanada and Reeves), with Sanada stealing the show in a few scenes. The visual effects were top notch, and some of the best of the year (It better get the Oscar nomination for Art Direction and/or Visual Effects). Then, the musical score. This is the best thing the theatrical version of the film has to offer, being an epic mix of action-adventure and emotion-charged cues. I'm really mad at movie-goers for not seeing this film at the theaters, and i don't really know why it did poorly. Are people just not interested in adventure films anymore? Because this is one of the best adventure movies of all time, easily, even if the characters aren't original. Oh and also, at the end of the film it does state it is ""inspired by the true story,"" not that it was a fully based-on or accurate portrayal of events, as some people had thought this film was supposed to be. And i personally think the fantastical elements helped make the film stand out as a good adaptation of this incredible story, because at that time in Japan, mystery and myth were a part of their daily lives.4/5 Stars*****UPDATE* It didn't get a single nomination at the Oscars or Globes.

1688581,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B00HEPDGKA,judy,"[0, 0]","This film quietly sneaked into the theaters, and quickly and quietly was kicked out when it debuted on the 25th of last December. '47 Ronin' bombed so badly it was laughable. I think it made more money here than in its own native country, where it also flopped. The film was rejected from everywhere. Not to mention its massive amount of production trouble which resulted in three release date shifts, the film finally was released after a tally of a whole year later after the film's original set release date (November 2012). As well as the budget growing higher and higher and fights over the cut of the film between the studio and director. This was a disaster making 150 million on a budget of 225 million. Most people hated the film, and I have to agree. My review of '47 Ronin'.'47 Ronin' is the tale of the 47 Ronin, who after watching their master kill himself honorably due to a spell being cast on himself, decide to take revenge on the man that did it. Among them is the master's second in command, Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada) a man sentenced to a year by Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano) in a pit to break his spirit, just in case he may want to seek revenge on his master's unjust execution. A year later he teams up with Kai (Keanu Reeves) a half breed, who was disgraced among the other samurais. Together the two along with the 45 other discharged samurais, seek revenge of Lord Kira, and to rescue the princess, Mika (Kou Shibasaki) who after her father's death, was forced to marry Lord Kira.You don't even know how hard it was for me to explain the story. I typed, and then retyped this thing 4 times, before settling on this one. Honestly, when you actually watch the film, it's a pretty by the numbers samurai tale. Just with mystical beasts, and witches, and cyclops...I'm not kidding when I tell you his one was filled to the brim with every possible visual effect you could imagine. It was god-awful. The first scene we watch with Keanu Reeves involves him and other samurais hunting down some gigantic, poorly animated CGI dog beast thing. I can't even describe it, as i9 had no clue what the hell it was at all. I go in thinking I'm going to see a samurai film, and I get a CGI dog thingy??? What the heck, that's what I thought.Not to mention the lackluster scripting which was over stuffed with characters and drawn out action sequences, oh and walking. Lots and lots of walking. The script could have been condensed into a light 90 minute popcorn flick, but instead we get this overlong, surprisingly dull flick that ticks in at about120 minutes. It didn't feel like 2 hours, it felt like 3. The scripting scimp's on characters to instead include a scene with a witch who turns into a dragon... The script didn't know what to do with itself. I mean, nobody stands out here at all. Keanu Reeves character is in about 15 minutes of the film, and is almost just as one dimensional as it gets. The witch is your stereotypical, freaky, goth girl with no style or substance given to her. I'm not even going to start on you with that dialogue. Just the most out right cringe worthy thing ever. I mean, when going for realistic you don't want to sound like a bunch of characters off of some old soap opera. When the words come out of the actor's mouth I just can't help but think 'What the hell? Did he seriously just say that?'.The editing is beyond bad. The film's editing is what kept the film from its original November 2012 release date with struggles over who gets the editing rights, the director or the studio and in the end, the film becomes lost between the fight. The editing cuts back in forth between fight scene, CGI galore, random close-up of Keanu Reeves just so you know he's there, and a few stupid pieces of dialogue about destiny and redemption thrown in for good measure.I'm not going to lie; I did find the production values quiet pleasant. The film was good to look at; I'm not going to lie. The scenery was beyond gorgeous, and the costumes were well designed. Japan was well represented in set designs and wardrobe. The film looked so lavish and pleasing to the eye.The actors gave it their all. 'Keanu Reeves' had surprisingly little screen time despite being billed the lead (Of course, it's Hollywood) and I couldn't call him more than a supporting character in spite of a few random un-necessary scene's made to try to make him a lead, even if his character wasn't. But in the few pieces of him that I actually found appropriate in the film, he did well. The Japanese native actors were pretty decent. Some of the actors spoke English with ease, while others not-so much and it didn't help that what they were saying was so badly written. 'Hiroyuki Sanada' whom played the real lead character, was outstandingly convincing in his role as an arrogant, yet loyal and brave leader of the Ronin. He slipped into his role with ease. Other highlights include Min Tanaka as Lord Asana the master, who was bewitched and later sentenced to death 40 minutes into the film. He was very good, and made for the role.All and all '47 Ronin' is a poorly scripted, shamefully edited, dull, CGI stuffed samurai film who's production values and well assembled cast are left betrayed by a lack of any character development. D 5/7/14'47 Ronin' is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence, some disturbing images and thematic elements. It's appropriate for 14 and up.",2,"Blah.

Not that the movie is bad as it does have a decent fantasy tale that has demons and witches along with ancient samurai battling it out but truly not enough of it.  It also seems that there are some things missing in the story as if left on the cutting room floor and unfortunately parts of the story that seem to drag along and keeps going on and on.  For me, the ending was a prime example of that, you think it is the last scene and nope, there is another and another and another and detracted from the movie a bit.  Reeves channels his inner Matrix as unfortunately it seems that's the only character type he can play with the monotone voice lack of emotion type character.  I liked Reeves in Matrix and even Constantine to a lesser extent, but he can't seem to do any other way of acting.One thing I will give credit to the movie though, the scenery was beautiful and the sets and effects well done.

1688598,AFOHUSVNZZ49W,B00HEPDGKA,K. Reynolds,"[0, 0]","IT SHOULD HAVE been better.My niece and I were anxious to catch &#8220;47 Ronin&#8221; after watching the previews at our local cineplex. We like Keanu Reeves, and the wonderful dragon that appears at movie&#8217;s finale captured our fangirl hearts. Gotta admit, too, I like co-star Hiroyuki Sanada of Syfy&#8217;s &#8220;Helix.&#8221; Actually, the film is packed with good actors and Reeves seems perfectly happy to be playing his part and working with them as seen in the extra &#8220;Keanu and Kai.&#8221; It&#8217;s as if he&#8217;s working on a completely different movie.That might be true. The script comes from Chris Morgan, who penned two &#8220;Fast and Furious&#8221; flicks,&#8221; and Hossein Amini of the radically uneven &#8220;Snow White and the Huntsman.&#8221; Carl Rinsch, with only a few video shorts under his belt, was picked to direct. Rumor has it Universal Studios continually tweaked the costly production, firing Rinsch during the edit when his original cut came in at three hours; the show now runs around two. The end result leaves us with a lot of big, lush scenes, but little opportunity for character development and unforgivably lousy pacing.The original story is simple &#8211; yet complex in the unique way of Asian culture. Good Lord Asano (Min Tanaka) is forced to commit ritual suicide after being framed by the evil Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano). The makes the 47 men of Asano&#8217;s samurai guard ronin. Tradition would have them also commit seppuku, but the men first clear their master&#8217;s name and avenge him before following Lord Asano in death. This new version blends historical events with magic and mythological creatures, including a witchy fox spirit in cahoots with Kira. Rinko Kikuchi gives her a slinky-evil &eacute;lan not seen since Disney&#8217;s animated Maleficent. Reeves&#8217; Kai is a foundling, raised and trained by supernatural beings; he is discovered and sheltered by Lord Asano, becoming the key to dealing with the story&#8217;s mystical mayhem.Argh! This should have been one good, rollicking adventure!The 2-D Blu-ray has a 1080p picture that seems a bit flat compared to others of its ilk; detail is sharp, however, and color is rich. Lighting is imaginative and energetic, and close-ups show good skin tones. The 3-D visuals are another story, losing opportunities to create a genuine, three-dimensional world, although several fight sequences and a snow scene look very good. Even so, a head prop looks so fake, it belongs in a high school production. CGI effects sometimes appear flat and take us out of the moment.Sound is another matter, with a 5.1 DTS-HD soundtrack that creates a terrific surround experience.HD bonus features are short and of the PR variety. Obviously, there&#8217;s no director&#8217;s commentary, but Rinsch appears in the making-of feature, &#8220;Re-forging the Legend.&#8221; We learn that everything &#8211; from armor and weapons to sets and costumes &#8211; was manufactured for the movie.Costume designer Penny Rose says, &#8220;They wanted a very glamorous and quite strong look to it.&#8221; Costumes and make-up blend period and contemporary styles. It works most of the time. When it doesn't, it fails badly as in the high-collared kimonos worn by Asano&#8217;s daughter, and Asano&#8217;s gray, page-boy hairstyle. (Shades of Prince Valiant!)&#8220;Myths, Magic & Monsters: The FX of &#8216;47 Ronin&#8217;&#8221; and &#8220;Steel Fury: The Fights of &#8216;47 Ronin&#8217;&#8221; are self-explanatory.Bottom line, &#8220;47 Ronin&#8221; is a flawed movie. It&#8217;s not the first time a film was sacrificed to a committee and it won&#8217;t be the last. A re-edit could salvage it, creating the vision Reeves and Rinsch hoped for.With the proven success of extended films on Blu-ray and DVD, it could happen.  &#8212; Kay Reynolds",3,History becomes fantasy,1397779200,"04 18, 2014",2014,3847,"['IT', 'SHOULD', 'HAVE', 'been', 'better.My', 'niece', 'were', 'anxious', 'catch', '8220', '47', 'Ronin', '8221', 'watching', 'previews', 'local', 'cineplex', 'like', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'wonderful', 'dragon', 'movie', '8217', 'finale', 'captured', 'fangirl', 'hearts', 'Got', 'ta', 'admit', 'too', 'like', 'co-star', 'Hiroyuki', 'Sanada', 'Syfy', '8217', '8220', 'Helix.', '8221', 'Actually', 'film', 'packed', 'good', 'actors', 'Reeves', 'perfectly', 'happy', 'be', 'playing', 'part', 'working', 'seen', 'extra', '8220', 'Keanu', 'Kai.', '8221', '8217', '8217', 'working', 'completely', 'different', 'movie.That', 'might', 'be', 'true', 'script', 'Chris', 'Morgan', 'who', 'penned', 'two', '8220', 'Fast', 'Furious', '8221', 'flicks', '8221', 'Hossein', 'Amini', 'radically', 'uneven', '8220', 'Snow', 'White', 'Huntsman.', '8221', 'Carl', 'Rinsch', 'only', 'few', 'video', 'shorts', 'belt', 'was', 'picked', 'direct', 'Rumor', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'continually', 'tweaked', 'costly', 'production', 'firing', 'Rinsch', 'edit', 'when', 'original', 'cut', 'came', 'three', 'hours', 'show', 'now', 'two', 'end', 'result', 'lot', 'big', 'lush', 'scenes', 'little', 'opportunity', 'character', 'development', 'unforgivably', 'lousy', 'pacing.The', 'original', 'story', 'simple', '8211', 'complex', 'unique', 'way', 'Asian', 'culture', 'Good', 'Lord', 'Asano', 'Min', 'Tanaka', 'forced', 'commit', 'ritual', 'suicide', 'being', 'framed', 'evil', 'Lord', 'Kira', 'Tadanobu', 'Asano', '47', 'men', 'Asano', '8217', 'samurai', 'guard', 'ronin', 'Tradition', 'would', 'have', 'also', 'commit', 'seppuku', 'men', 'first', 'clear', 'master', '8217', 'name', 'avenge', 'following', 'Lord', 'Asano', 'death', 'new', 'version', 'historical', 'events', 'magic', 'mythological', 'creatures', 'including', 'witchy', 'fox', 'spirit', 'cahoots', 'Kira', 'Rinko', 'Kikuchi', 'slinky-evil', 'eacute', 'not', 'seen', 'Disney', '8217', 'animated', 'Maleficent', 'Reeves', '8217', 'Kai', 'foundling', 'raised', 'trained', 'supernatural', 'beings', 'discovered', 'sheltered', 'Lord', 'Asano', 'becoming', 'key', 'dealing', 'story', '8217', 'mystical', 'mayhem.Argh', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'good', 'rollicking', 'adventure', '2-D', 'Blu-ray', '1080p', 'picture', 'bit', 'flat', 'compared', 'others', 'ilk', 'detail', 'sharp', 'however', 'color', 'rich', 'Lighting', 'imaginative', 'energetic', 'close-ups', 'show', 'good', 'skin', 'tones', '3-D', 'visuals', 'are', 'story', 'losing', 'opportunities', 'create', 'genuine', 'three-dimensional', 'world', 'several', 'fight', 'sequences', 'snow', 'scene', 'look', 'very', 'good', 'Even', 'so', 'head', 'prop', 'so', 'fake', 'high', 'school', 'production', 'CGI', 'effects', 'sometimes', 'appear', 'flat', 'take', 'moment.Sound', 'matter', '5.1', 'DTS-HD', 'soundtrack', 'terrific', 'surround', 'experience.HD', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'short', 'PR', 'variety', 'Obviously', '8217', 'director', '8217', 's', 'commentary', 'Rinsch', 'making-of', 'feature', '8220', 'Re-forging', 'Legend.', '8221', 'learn', 'everything', '8211', 'armor', 'weapons', 'sets', 'costumes', '8211', 'was', 'manufactured', 'movie.Costume', 'designer', 'Penny', 'Rose', '8220', 'wanted', 'very', 'glamorous', 'quite', 'strong', 'look', 'it.', '8221', 'Costumes', 'make-up', 'blend', 'period', 'contemporary', 'styles', 'most', 'time', 'When', ""n't"", 'badly', 'high-collared', 'kimonos', 'worn', 'Asano', '8217', 's', 'daughter', 'Asano', '8217', 's', 'gray', 'page-boy', 'hairstyle', 'Shades', 'Prince', 'Valiant', '8220', 'Myths', 'Magic', 'Monsters', 'FX', '8216', '47', 'Ronin', '8217', '8221', '8220', 'Steel', 'Fury', 'Fights', '8216', '47', 'Ronin', '8217', '8221', 'are', 'self-explanatory.Bottom', 'line', '8220', '47', 'Ronin', '8221', 'flawed', 'movie', '8217', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'sacrificed', 'committee', 'won', '8217', 'be', 'last', 're-edit', 'could', 'salvage', 'creating', 'vision', 'Reeves', 'Rinsch', 'hoped', 'for.With', 'proven', 'success', 'extended', 'films', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'could', 'happen', '8212', 'Kay', 'Reynolds']",N/A

1688600,A1DWUPXRD1HN1B,B00HEPDGKA,Kurt Russell,"[165, 185]","Gorgeously shot, vividly imagined, heavy and heartfelt - this movie should not be skipped by true fantasy-adventure fans.I can see why mainstream America and the media misunderstood it - Asian protagonists, brooding tone, tragic romance, a plot driven by foreign ideals like &#34;honor&#34; and &#34;shame.&#34; People with no exposure to a traditional Japanese world might scratch their head at the notion of seppuku, or leaving your wife to avenge lost honor, but if you are worldly enough to embrace different cultures and values, you will be rewarded by this richly imagined film.Thematically, this movie is smart. First, the film is refreshingly devoid of any irony or post-modern humor that can weaken the modern blockbuster, which always seems to try to be all things to all people. So while the plot may be simple, it is still told in surprising ways. One can never entirely predict the next thing to happen throughout the movie, another novel way the movie is better than expected.And the execution of this revenge yarn is layered with heavier topics like class, morality, equality and freedom. One of the two main protagonists is a low-class &#34;half-breed&#34; (actually half-demon) while the rest are pure Japanese. This intriguing character faithfully serves his masters while tolerating their cruelty, finally proving by the end to be transcendentally superior to all of their humiliation and ignominy. With a movie about slavery likely to take home Best Picture for 2013, it's a shame that this particular genre film is so easily dismissed by critics although it also delves into the difficult subject with an insightful and intelligent perspective. But again, the average member of the audience is probably a little taken aback by their hero grovelling for mercy to a holy emperor, when the typical American badass hero would simply shoot first.The film is also a triumph on the technical end. If the wild monsters, ghosts, demons and witches don't appeal to you visually - all rendered in sleek new ways heretofore unseen in an American film - then perhaps the lush backgrounds and intricate costumes will entertain you in even the slowest scenes. Score, cinematography, editing, sound, acting - the movie is exquisitely made and best enjoyed on the biggest screen.So despite being oddly pro-suicide, the movie is simply astounding. It is a genuine cinematic masterpiece, especially for its unique historical Japanese backdrop.

For whatever reason, I did not get a chance to. So when it became available to rent, I jumped on it. I personally think that Keanu Reeves is one of those actors that is underappreciated (is that a word?) but usually gives a decent performance. I was not disappointed. His portrayal of the half-breed Kai was great. He always seems to immerse himself into the role, the character, and the storyline.  And no matter what Reeves stars in, you find yourself empathizing or sympathizing with him. He is usually the underdog, the champion, and the quiet hero.  And his role in ""47 Ronin"" is no exception.  Kai (Reeves) is the mistreated and neglected half-breed (a half demon) who has found love, and in a sense salvation with the ruler's daughter, he hopes to one day find freedom and respect.  The only thing standing in his way is a very ambitious ruler, who will stop at nothing to get power including aligning himself with a witch/demon and betraying those close to him. While the greedy ruler takes steps to take over the throne, those determined to right a wrong are prepared to make the supreme sacrifice. And the only thing that can stop this pervasive evil is the steadfast determination of 47 honorable samauri who are willing to lay down their lives for what is right (Hiroyuki Sanada (of Helix), does a wonderful job portraying the Samurai leader).In conclusion, 47 Ronin was entertaining and exciting to watch. While not perfect, it was a delight to the senses. The cinematography (not too dark but not too bright either), costumes (seemed authentic) and special effects were eye catching, and the plot decent. Basically, this film offered everything that you would want in a sci fi/action adventure film that included a touch of the martial arts and mysticism. It was a decent story of love, demons, redemption, betrayal, sacrifice and vengeance. And while the ending was bitter sweet, it was honest and fitting. I enjoyed 47 Ronin and would recommend it.

(as a side note, if you enjoy Asian fantasy I recommend ""Painted Skin: The Resurrection""). As much as I enjoyed 47 Ronin for what it has to offer, I still feel as though I just watched an unfinished product. For example, watch the trailer. If you see the trailer after watching the movie, you can see how much of the trailer isn't even in the finished film. Editing always occurs, and primarily for budgetary constraints. However, it's extremely noticeable here.For example, the creepy bald tattooed guy is seen in the trailer (and even on the cover) wielding a pistol. He shows up more in the trailer than in the actual film, where he appears for 10 seconds and delivers one line. Why is he even on the cover? Obviously, his character played a much larger role than what was released in theaters.Too much of this movie was left on the cutting room floor, and it suffered as a result. It reminds me a bit of Kingdom of Heaven, a decent to above average release that was made wonderful with a directors cut restoring major plot elements and even characters that were never in the theatrical version. 47 Ronin needs to have a directors cut of its own. This movie could easily be 20+ minutes longer to remedy gaps in the story and thin character development that were likely cut out.It's a solid, entertaining film right now. But it doesn't feel like a complete film.

It lacks strength and conviction to fulfill his movie role, especially when we're referring to the main protagonist. The movie flow is choppy and continuously disconnects me from any possible emersion.The end enemy as seen in the trailer is a dragon.

I was excited and very pleased to hear that a big Hollywood production company would actually embrace one of the most inspiring (foreign) tales in human history; a story about the terrible cost of justice, brought about by honor, character, and loyalty; with determination, perseverance and suffering- not even considering the deaths of the 47 ronin ([46, actually] and historically, at least two of their mothers and other acquaintances).I'm very traditional and ""old-fashioned"". I've been to Sengaku-ji several times; I know the extreme reverence that Japanese society has for these ronin. I know enough about the actual story to know where the director's ""theatrical license"" warped and muddied the Japanese behavior, character, and story line in his effort to make the story more universally appealing. I was appalled to hear that the story of ""The 47 Ronin"" was going to involve ghosts, spirits and specters. And Keanu Reeves (or any other ""white"" [American]. Not that I have anything against whites or Americans; but this tale, if portrayed accurately, only involves a pure Japanese society [in its' own time- 1701 to 1703]).I've also been a huge Sanada fan, back to his teenage years in the JAC. I liked Keanu Reeves all the way back to his ""whooaa"" in 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure'. So I decided to grit my teeth and watched this movie. It wasn't nearly as bad as I expected. I was lucky to understand before I viewed it that it was going to be a Hollywood fantasy. I really had no expectations--I didn't know how H'wood would incorporate the 47 ronin into a 'ghost story', but I knew going in beforehand, that H'wood had yet again disparaged and vilified another hallowed foreign sanctuary.For all it's faults- and there are lots of other reviewers who'll detail what they see as poor script, story, and acting qualities- this movie holds one singular appeal for me. I've seen the 'ugly American(s)' conduct themselves in Japan (in my presence, and sometimes, ignorant of my observation). Even in the majority of the 5-star reviews, there's an almost universal self-congratulatory condescension (that the writers unknowingly author) praising the film for it's connection to historical relevance- when it's obvious that most of the reviewers' knowledge of the Ako vendetta is at the very best, superficial, and in many cases, only linked through each writer's ""authoritative"" knowledge by chanbara movies and video games.This movie is an abomination; the mistitle, ""47 Ronin"", is as badly misleading as McDonald Hamburger's claim is, that their offerings approximate nutritious ground-beef ""burgers"", et. al.However, if the movie is watched for entertainment only, it's passable- and as the movie 'Copying Beethoven' might have made people curious about Beethoven's works- this movie might encourage the viewer to be curious enough to do some research on the actual historical event, ""Chushingura"" (a Japanese word used to describe all written, acted, and filmed portrayals surrounding the Ako Vendetta).If you're interested in the 47 ronin as treated in film, there are three versions that are roundly praised as better movies- ""Chushingura [1962]"" by Inagaki, ""The 47 Ronin"" by Mizoguchi, and NET's ""Dai Chushingura"", a 52-episodic TV serial.",3,Maybe it's good enough to promote curiosity about the true story '47 Ronin',1398902400,"05 1, 2014",2014,3403,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', '2', '*years*', 'movie', 'almost', 'three', 'years', 'actually', 'When', 'Sanada', 'Hiroyuki', 'was', 'cast', 'Oishi', 'Kuranosuke', 'had', 'great', 'hopes', 'was', 'excited', 'very', 'pleased', 'hear', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'company', 'would', 'actually', 'embrace', 'one', 'most', 'inspiring', 'foreign', 'tales', 'human', 'history', 'story', 'terrible', 'cost', 'justice', 'brought', 'honor', 'character', 'loyalty', 'determination', 'perseverance', 'suffering-', 'not', 'even', 'considering', 'deaths', '47', 'ronin', '[', '46', 'actually', ']', 'historically', 'least', 'two', 'mothers', 'other', 'acquaintances', '.I', ""'m"", 'very', 'traditional', 'old-fashioned', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Sengaku-ji', 'several', 'times', 'know', 'extreme', 'reverence', 'Japanese', 'society', 'ronin', 'know', 'enough', 'actual', 'story', 'know', 'where', 'director', 'theatrical', 'license', 'warped', 'muddied', 'Japanese', 'behavior', 'character', 'story', 'line', 'effort', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'universally', 'appealing', 'was', 'appalled', 'hear', 'story', '47', 'Ronin', 'was', 'going', 'involve', 'ghosts', 'spirits', 'specters', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'other', 'white', '[', 'American', ']', 'Not', 'have', 'anything', 'whites', 'Americans', 'tale', 'portrayed', 'accurately', 'only', 'pure', 'Japanese', 'society', '[', 'own', 'time-', '1701', '1703', ']', '.I', ""'ve"", 'also', 'been', 'huge', 'Sanada', 'fan', 'back', 'teenage', 'years', 'JAC', 'liked', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'way', 'back', 'whooaa', ""'Bill"", 'Ted', 'Excellent', 'Adventure', 'decided', 'grit', 'teeth', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'expected', 'was', 'lucky', 'understand', 'viewed', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Hollywood', 'fantasy', 'really', 'had', 'expectations', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', ""H'wood"", 'would', 'incorporate', '47', 'ronin', ""'ghost"", 'story', 'knew', 'going', 'beforehand', ""H'wood"", 'had', 'yet', 'again', 'disparaged', 'vilified', 'hallowed', 'foreign', 'sanctuary.For', 'faults-', 'are', 'lots', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', ""'ll"", 'detail', 'what', 'see', 'poor', 'script', 'story', 'acting', 'qualities-', 'movie', 'one', 'singular', 'appeal', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ugly"", 'American', 'conduct', 'Japan', 'presence', 'sometimes', 'ignorant', 'observation', 'Even', 'majority', '5-star', 'reviews', 'almost', 'universal', 'self-congratulatory', 'condescension', 'writers', 'unknowingly', 'author', 'praising', 'film', 'connection', 'historical', 'relevance-', 'when', 'obvious', 'most', 'reviewers', 'knowledge', 'Ako', 'vendetta', 'very', 'best', 'superficial', 'many', 'cases', 'only', 'linked', 'writer', 'authoritative', 'knowledge', 'chanbara', 'movies', 'video', 'games.This', 'movie', 'abomination', 'mistitle', '47', 'Ronin', 'as', 'badly', 'misleading', 'McDonald', 'Hamburger', 'claim', 'offerings', 'approximate', 'nutritious', 'ground-beef', 'burgers', 'et', 'al.However', 'movie', 'watched', 'entertainment', 'only', 'passable-', 'movie', ""'Copying"", 'Beethoven', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'people', 'curious', 'Beethoven', 'works-', 'movie', 'might', 'encourage', 'viewer', 'be', 'curious', 'enough', 'do', 'research', 'actual', 'historical', 'event', 'Chushingura', 'Japanese', 'word', 'used', 'describe', 'written', 'acted', 'filmed', 'portrayals', 'surrounding', 'Ako', 'Vendetta', '.If', ""'re"", 'interested', '47', 'ronin', 'treated', 'film', 'are', 'three', 'versions', 'are', 'roundly', 'praised', 'better', 'movies-', 'Chushingura', '[', '1962', ']', 'Inagaki', '47', 'Ronin', 'Mizoguchi', 'NET', 'Dai', 'Chushingura', '52-episodic', 'TV', 'serial']",N/A

The loyalty of the ronin to their fallen lord is inspiring.The love story between two of the characters was touching as well without being overbearing, it did not hijack the plot which happens in many films. They also stayed true to feudal japanese societal rules to a greater degree than many movies.For example some movies set in feudal japan will have a peasant ""half breed"" (keanu reeves character) somehow have status and respect from samurai which is highly unlikely bordering on absurd. In this film the half breed is considered much lower than the samurai and he accepts this. Its not until they become ronin that they get closer to equals and then the half breed starts talking back instead of just quietly accepting his lower status. This is much more reasonable, helps plot development, and is smart of the writer/director to understand the feel of feudal japan.The special effects and mythical elements are very well done! There is a magical witch and a few spirits and creatures from classical japanese mythology.The fight scenes are really well done and well choreographed.I have nothing bad to say about this movie other than it could have been longer! Its already two hours but could have used another to give background on the samurai's lives and the elements of japanese mythology.I already knew these things going in so hearing the name of a japanese mythological entity or when a person is asked to be anothers ""second"" for sepukku, i was primed for what came next.

Instead of &#8220;47 Ronin&#8221;, it should have been called &#8220;47 Things Wrong With This Movie&#8221;.2. Spoiler alert: The biggest problem with the movie is that it's a trick. While it&#8217;s supposed to be about 47 renegade warriors on a mission of vengeance, they only appear in like the last 10 minutes.3. To be fair, it&#8217;s not complete crap. It&#8217;s visually stylish and has great special effects. But&#8230; that&#8217;s about it.4. The 47 Ronin actually did exist in real life. But I don&#8217;t think they fought witch dragons or magical swordsmen.5. This big-budget movie was entrusted to a brand new director, and he is clearly out of his depth. This movie is inconsistent in every way possible. The pacing is terrible. And while it&#8217;s interesting visually, the style seems to compete with itself, like two different movies were being made.6. The whole movie feels like it&#8217;s on fast forward. It rushes through the plot, so that you don&#8217;t have time to learn or care about the characters. Then it suddenly slows down for some stupid love story or discussion about honor.7. For a movie about rage, vengeance, and doomed love, there is surprisingly little emotion in the film. It&#8217;s fairly cold and one-dimensional. It&#8217;s also not all that violent.8. Sometimes the characters speak Japanese. Sometimes they speak English with a Japanese accent. Sometimes they speak English with a British accent. Keanu Reeves just sounds like Keanu Reeves.9. The movie was supposed to have been released Christmas 2012. But they kept pushing it back so they could re-do parts of it. That's always a bad sign, and the results are right on the screen.

Keanu Reeves did a decent job as a foundling who, after having been raised by demons, returns to the human world and the service of Lord Asano. The story is very far from the traditional version and has a heavy fantasy component, which perhaps explains why it didn't do well in Japan: I imagine the Japanese did not like their story messed with in such a hollywood fashion. On the other hand, the fantasy element turns what would otherwise be a private revenge drama into something of greater consequence. For me, it did not detract from the plot.What did, however, detract from the plot was the romance between Keanu Reeves' character and Lord Asano's daughter.

Just as with Kara Dalkey's ""Genpei,"" or the Japanese films ""Gojoe"" and ""Ashura,"" this remake of the historic epic brings a mythical quality to the tale, moving it into the realm of fantasy and making no attempt to adhere rigidly to the factual details.  When versions like this one are made, it is assumed that the viewers will already be familiar with previous renditions, and be capable of appreciating a remake that is nuanced very differently.Unfortunately, film-makers sometimes forget that there are movie-going fundamentalists who are fully prepared to take offense at the least deviation from their expectations.  Thus we see other reviewers trashing the film for not being a carbon-copy clone of previous versions, or for introducing the element of ""the white savior"" ~ a ridiculous complaint, as the protagonist's abilities are due to his having been trained as an outcaste youth by tengu, the famous mountain warrior demons of Japanese lore; his being an illegitimate half-breed is the reason for his rejection and has nothing to do with his abilities.Those who allow such trifles to spoil their enjoyment of the beautiful cinematography and CGI effects are unfortunate indeed, as this film gives its Japanese cousins an excellent run for their money.  If one is willing to overlook the fact that Keanu Reeves has only one acting style that he brings to ""Ronin"" just as he did to ""Matrix,"" ""Little Buddha,"" etc., it might be difficult to find any real (as opposed to imagined) fault with this offering.

For those of you that don't know the ronin were real people and the events they went through were also real however this movie brings their history in and mixes it Japanese mythology in by bringing in demons and magic.I did like how Keanu Reeves's character was seen as a dirty inbred because in that era it was extremely taboo to be mixed race and that is how many were treated. By the way, Keanu is mixed himself. He's English, Native Hawaiian, Chinese, Irish, and Portuguese ancestry so he's not really &#34;white&#34; he's mixed.The actors were great in their roles and were all grade-A Japanese actors in Japan. I mainly watched this movie for Jin Akanishi who plays Oishi's son Chikara but I knew the rest of Japanese actors from previous dramas and movies I've watched in the past.The reason why I give this a 4 is because the movie tended to drag in certain areas and I found some of Keanu's lines kind of corny sounding which I think is because they are lines better said in Japanese than English. The other reason I give this movie a 4 is because of the promotion and the way the product itself is held. I found the cover and even the special features a bit racist/prejudice for the reason being that they don't focus on any other characters in the film except the &#34;white&#34; dude. The guy with the skeleton face paint is only in the movie for 1 minute so I don't even know why he's on the cover it should be Oishi and his son like the Japanese cover. The whole movie is about Kai and Oishi's friendship along with their relationships between the rest of the ronin and how the unite while looking passed prejudice of Kai being different and defeating the witch that is creating havoc while restoring their honor and revenge for their slain master. The cover doesn't show any of that just a bunch of white looking people and one evil asian woman. This is why I decided to buy the imported bluray instead of the american version.Other than that small issue I have with the promotational part of the product I do think people should give it a shot and watch it.

1688709,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B00HEPDGKA,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[0, 0]","[Aside, before my review proper: it is not enough for studios and for stars to ensure the hero/heroine's part is well written, it is also crucial for the audience's pleasure that the villain/villainess's part be well written too. otherwise the film will simply not perform as well financially as it might have done. audience's won't know why they don't respond to the story, as most audiences don't understand in-depth story mechanics, but they will know they don't like it, and will give weak reviews and word of mouth, and hundreds of millions of investment dollars won't get the return they might have done, all because the filmmaking team didn't bother to understand, and include, the essential work necessary for a properly written villain/villainess.  unfortunate, as this is easily rectified. (though alittle more complicated, this error is analogous to making homemade chicken soup and omitting the salt.)]Kai (Keanu Reeves) is a mixed race outcast child found by a high ranking gentleman in the woods and kindly taken in to be fed and live on the outskirts of society. loved by the official's only child Kai, though disrespected by society, seems generally okay with the status quo as he loves the child, later young woman, and is content to be near her. he is also appreciative and grateful to the kindly official for allowing him to live amongst them. he earns his keep by serving the official and the official's samurai as a first class tracker and actively and modestly works to be of use to them, for which the official graciously thanks him, though the official's samurai treat him distainfully, apparently because he is of mixed race and apparently because the part of the forest in which he is found is rumored to be controlled by demons and when he is initially found he has markings on his head which they say are marks of a demon. to us the marks appear to be healed wounds someone has inflicted on the child. Kai, though clearly intelligent, initially displays almost no supernatural abilities (he smells that something is wrong with the beast but it is unclear whether he knows this because he knows how the animal is supposed to smell from previous tracking, or he knows this because of magic - as he smells a leaf and then makes his statement, his comment is vague enough that we can attribute it to his tracking expertise). as a preeminent tracker he is able to slay the monstrous beast single-handedly. he achieves this feat through bravery and a willingness to risk his life for the villagers but though successful, credit for this accomplishment is given to another.He experiences a lot of really nasty racism (almost getting murdered by a samurai as a reward for saving the samurai's life) and is frequently contemptuously called half breed by the other characters (which humorously and inappropriately kept bringing to mind Cher's old song of the same name).an ambitious competitor comes to visit bringing his witch and basically kills the kindly official and takes his daughter and lands.  the official's samurai vow revenge, though they are ordered not to by an even higher official (shogun). ignoring the shogun they kill the interloper and are punished with death.story's main strengths: Kai is a very sympathetic character. he is uncomplaining even when treated poorly. He's able to remain stoic because of the decency of the official and the kindness and love of the official's daughter, Mika. these three characters are the heart of the story and are well written, but it is not really believable that an outcast who has been accepted by the dominant male and female in a group would continue to be so poorly treated by the official's employees, the samurai.human nature i.e., a desire and need to please their master who they are financially dependent upon, would have had the samurai treat Kai with at least surface politeness because he is accepted by the most wealthy and successful official in the province. the samurai's mistreatment would've been an insult to their lord, and I just don't see them behaving this way, given their position in life. a very rough modern analogy would be office workers in a small company: say all the secretaries who, for whatever reason, dislike one of the female office clerks. the female company owner who works in the office daily however likes the clerk and shows this by thanking her for her work ethic. do you really think the secretaries would ostrisize, harass and abuse the clerk, knowing the owner likes her? no, they would not, especially in a small firm where group harassment and abuse would be known by all. a secretary or two might try sneaky and snide attacks, but all the secretaries working en mass would not do so because they would fear the consequences, i.e., possible job loss.an audience may not think of this specific comparison, but they would know intuitively that something is off about this group harassment dynamic, given the dominant male's (who is essentially their ruler on the local level) acceptance of Kai. a fact not fully appreciated by most filmmakers is that audiences are experts on human behavior having interacted with other humans since birth. filmmakers therefore are pitching their stories to Ph.D.'s in human behavior (not human nature though: audiences generally do not know human nature, as we're a species who, in my opinion, are still, unfortunately, largely ignorant of ourselves. but we are experts in recognizing human behavior within a framework, be it fictitious or otherwise). an audience can easily differentiate between authentic and fake behavior and simply will not respond positively to nonsensical human interactions in a story. they may not know what's wrong specifically, but they will know something is false. instead of recommending a film to friends/family they'll say ""it's okay"" or ""worth a watch but I wouldn't buy it,"" when the filmmakers want them to say ""worth standing in line for,"" or ""loved it, buy immediately.""story's main weakness: villains aren't impressive enough and need to do more damage to more characters; they are greedy, ambitious, spiteful and cruel, rather than evil. and they are dumb: what evil villain worth her/his salt would throw the lead samurai into a hole for nearly a year, only to let him out right before the forced marriage of the murdered official's daughter. of course the ex-samurai is going to gather his forces for revenge and rescue. dumb villains are not scary. even little kids just being exposed to fairy tales know that. difficult then to fear a villain who fails Villainy 101, no matter how impressive the visuals.also the following is unbelievable: a man is imprisoned in a dank hole for a year, barely surviving, is freed and can hardly walk, is incoherent and confused when found by his son and wife in the street. yet after one modest meal, exchanging a hug with his loving wife, and instructing his son, he's off on a rescue mission. this character is not magical and so his sudden recovery is not believable. a scene or two of him getting his strength back, perhaps his wife nursing him, maybe a little light exercise before hopping on a horse for what looks like miles long galloping across open countryside, would've made his physical abilities believable. I know he got out of prison a week before the official's daughter was to be married and so time was of the essence, but the way the writer/filmmakers wrote/filmed/edited his physical abilities, so soon after his weakened imprisoned state, does not work. in a sequence or so later, with no physical rehabilitation or strength conditioning, he's in a fight for his life with the Keanu Reeves character, who he's trying to rescue, and in the fight he acquits himself too well for a man who's been nearly starved for a year and who has been without exercise. story needs some work here.the main villain I suppose is Kira, but he spends too much of the film smirking (literally, this is what he does in his character's introduction into the story, which was not a good call by the filmmakers). he also indulges his taste for cruelty to those of lower rank than himself, which makes him a bully, rather than evil. he seems weak and spoiled, rather than frightening. his witch is his secret weapon, and though she has her witch skill set, she is spiteful rather than frightening. neither is impressive enough individually or together to inspire alarm. also, by having them go after this one official, the storyteller doesn't make them big enough, their interests are too narrow: they are focused on this one official, his daughter and property, and are not a threat to the larger society or country. the filmmakers don't understand the role of the villain. villains need to be a metastasizing cancer, in my opinion. in this story the villains are pre-cancerous: the twosome are a nasty piece of work for sure but little more than opportunistic bullies with a touch of black magic provided by the witch.an effective villain is much more than a mere bully. an effective villain is, and must be shown to be in the story, willing to do whatever it takes to get their way. their value system is totally skewed: they do not consider the lives of anyone other than themselves to be of any consequence if those lives restrict them from attaining their goals. and they must be intelligent. their entire crew needn't be smart, but the mastermind(s) must be bright; it is a requirement, as a dumb villain is not scary. had the filmmakers/writers understood villainy the lead samurai would've been killed rather than thrown in a hole; the entire village would've been razed to the ground, and that would've been only the beginning. villains don't play nice and they don't care. they are rabid dogs (who on the outside look normal) and the job of the writer is to demonstrate their utter ruthlessness and narcissism, thereby giving the hero/heroine work to do by destroying them. these villains are villain-lites therefore the story is weakened.2 and 3/4 stars rounded up to 3, for solid

There is nothing honorable about lying or permitting others to lie. Suicide is also an abomination, which must not be permitted or honored, as this film would have us believe.When the Ronin go to a sect of alien Buddhists, their leader is required to watch his friends all be killed in front of him, without drawing his sword to help them, as a condition for being given weapons to hunt their enemies. Does no one else see how corrupt that idea is? How many of your friends would you see killed to obtain power?The Ronin succeed in overthrowing the witches and demons, and they are honored by winning the right to kill themselves. No man has the righteous power to order another man to kill himself. King David's prayer to God for all nations is that their corrupt leaders be overthrown to remind them that they are men, not gods. Those Ronin should have overthrown and killed that presumptuous Shogun too, and the god-emperor as well.

1688738,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00HEPDGKA,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 13]","In &#8220;47 Ronin&#8221; Keanu Reeves plays Kai, a &#8220;half-human&#8221; or an outcast with formidable fighting skills and supernatural powers, adopted by Lord Asano of Akou domain. Set in the fictional 18th-century feudal Japan, (where sword-wielding samurai fight a demonic creature and shape-shifting &#8220;sorceress&#8221;), the film looks like a curious mixture of jidaigeki (or Japanese period drama) and CGI-filled epic fantasy.The story is loosely based on a popular kabuki play &#8220;Chushingura&#8221; (and countless Japanese movie and TV-show versions that followed, including Kenji Mizoguchi&#8217;s 1941 classic drama &#8220;The 47 Ronin&#8221;), about forty-seven ronin, or samurai without master, avenging the disgrace and death of their revered master Lord Asano (Min Tanaka). For Japanese, this story, which was inspired by real-life incidents that happened 1701-03, has been a famous one for more than four hundred years.Hiroyuki Sanada (&#8220;The Last Samurai&#8221; &#8220;The Wolverine&#8221;) plays Oishi, a samurai faithful to Lord Asano. Tadanobu Asano (&#8220;Battleship&#8221; &#8220;Thor&#8221;) is Lord Kira, the &#8220;villain&#8221; of the story that secretly plans to take over Asano&#8217;s fiefdom. Kou Shibasaki is Asano&#8217;s daughter Mika and Rinko Kikuchi (&#8220;Babel&#8221;) is a mysterious woman using witchcraft.The gorgeous sets and beautiful costumes are worth watching, and bearded, sword-fighting Keanu Reeves is pretty good, if a bit wooden, as the protagonist Kai, though Hiroyuki Sanada steals every scene he is in, as Kuranosuke Oishi, charismatic leader of the masterless samurai. Rinko Kikuchi&#8217;s performance as a &#8220;witch&#8221; almost becomes campy fun, whether intentionally or not.For the new version of &#8220;Chushingura&#8221; Universal Studio hired writers Chris Morgan (responsible for the third and subsequent installments of &#8220;The Fast and the Furious&#8221; franchise) and Hossein Amini (Oscar nominated for &#8220;The Wings of the Dove&#8221;). Director is first-timer Carl Rinsch, who seems to be striving for artistic and entertainment values at the same time, but with limited success. More problematic is the disappointing visual effects and choppy editing that sometimes ruins the action part.To me, the film seems not to know what it wants to be. At the center of the film is bushidou or samurai code of honor, which is overshadowed by fantasy elements. As a fantasy movie, action is few and far between. As a drama, the relationship between Keanu Reeves&#8217; (fictional) character and the band of (real-life) ronin is not fully explored, and Kou Shibasaki&#8217;s character, love interest for Kai, is underdeveloped.This is not to say that &#8220;47 Ronin&#8221; is a bad movie. It is mildly entertaining big-budget movie that defies genre, an interesting blend of period piece and action fantasy (part inspired by Hayao Miyazaki&#8217;s &#8220;Princess Mononoke&#8221;), but I think the film would have been much better with a more focused approach to the subject matter.",3,"Chushingura as Fantasy Action: Keanu Reeves, Samurai Sword Fighting and Dark Magic in One Movie",1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,3069,"['8220', '47', 'Ronin', '8221', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Kai', '8220', 'half-human', '8221', 'outcast', 'formidable', 'fighting', 'skills', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'adopted', 'Lord', 'Asano', 'Akou', 'domain', 'Set', 'fictional', '18th-century', 'feudal', 'Japan', 'where', 'sword-wielding', 'samurai', 'fight', 'demonic', 'creature', 'shape-shifting', '8220', '8221', 'film', 'curious', 'mixture', 'jidaigeki', 'Japanese', 'period', 'drama', 'CGI-filled', 'epic', 'fantasy.The', 'story', 'loosely', 'based', 'popular', 'kabuki', 'play', '8220', 'Chushingura', '8221', 'countless', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'TV-show', 'versions', 'followed', 'including', 'Kenji', 'Mizoguchi', '8217', 's', '1941', 'classic', 'drama', '8220', '47', 'Ronin', '8221', 'about', 'forty-seven', 'ronin', 'samurai', 'master', 'avenging', 'disgrace', 'death', 'revered', 'master', 'Lord', 'Asano', 'Min', 'Tanaka', 'Japanese', 'story', 'was', 'inspired', 'real-life', 'incidents', 'happened', '1701-03', 'been', 'famous', 'one', 'more', 'four', 'hundred', 'years.Hiroyuki', 'Sanada', '8220', 'Last', 'Samurai', '8221', '8220', 'Wolverine', '8221', 'Oishi', 'samurai', 'faithful', 'Lord', 'Asano', 'Tadanobu', 'Asano', '8220', 'Battleship', '8221', '8220', 'Thor', '8221', 'Lord', 'Kira', '8220', 'villain', '8221', 'story', 'secretly', 'take', 'over', 'Asano', '8217', 's', 'fiefdom', 'Kou', 'Shibasaki', 'Asano', '8217', 'daughter', 'Mika', 'Rinko', 'Kikuchi', '8220', 'Babel', '8221', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'using', 'witchcraft.The', 'gorgeous', 'sets', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'bearded', 'sword-fighting', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'pretty', 'good', 'bit', 'wooden', 'protagonist', 'Kai', 'Hiroyuki', 'Sanada', 'steals', 'scene', 'Kuranosuke', 'Oishi', 'charismatic', 'leader', 'masterless', 'samurai', 'Rinko', 'Kikuchi', '8217', 's', 'performance', '8220', 'witch', '8221', 'almost', 'campy', 'fun', 'intentionally', 'not.For', 'new', 'version', '8220', 'Chushingura', '8221', 'Universal', 'Studio', 'hired', 'writers', 'Chris', 'Morgan', 'responsible', 'third', 'subsequent', 'installments', '8220', 'Fast', 'Furious', '8221', 'franchise', 'Hossein', 'Amini', 'Oscar', 'nominated', '8220', 'Wings', 'Dove', '8221', 'Director', 'first-timer', 'Carl', 'Rinsch', 'who', 'be', 'striving', 'artistic', 'entertainment', 'values', 'same', 'time', 'limited', 'success', 'More', 'problematic', 'disappointing', 'visual', 'effects', 'choppy', 'editing', 'sometimes', 'action', 'film', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'be', 'center', 'film', 'bushidou', 'samurai', 'code', 'honor', 'overshadowed', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'action', 'few', 'far', 'drama', 'relationship', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', '8217', 'fictional', 'character', 'band', 'real-life', 'ronin', 'not', 'fully', 'explored', 'Kou', 'Shibasaki', '8217', 's', 'character', 'love', 'interest', 'Kai', 'underdeveloped.This', 'not', 'say', '8220', '47', 'Ronin', '8221', 'bad', 'movie', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'big-budget', 'movie', 'genre', 'interesting', 'blend', 'period', 'piece', 'action', 'fantasy', 'part', 'inspired', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', '8217', '8220', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', '8221', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'focused', 'approach', 'subject', 'matter']",N/A

The tale is retold with vivid creativity.  The effects are excellent.  The action is superb.  Solid writing alongside skillful acting really brings these characters to life.Don't listen to other reviewers who trash Keanu's part.  Keanu in fact DOES play one of the main characters, not a peripheral or throwaway character designed to get you to watch the movie.  His character, Kai, is extremely important.  Linked to the demonic Tengu and the main love story in the plot.  Remove Kai and you have no story.This movie does everything well.  The plot twists, asks a lot of the characters, and never feels too linear or designed for our heroes to win.  In fact, they often go up against some really challenging predicaments and barely come out on top, through interesting and thrilling action, subterfuge, and magic.The only flaw?  Why is that tattooed guy on the cover?  He has the smallest part and is definitely under-used.The monsters are done well.  The action is exciting.  You cannot go wrong here.  BUY IT.
