The movies they made with these cameras is what basically makes up this television special. Better and more interesting than most of the Brady specials/documentaries. This special was put together by Susan Olsen (Cindy), which gives it some genuine Brady cred. Cast members are present as well to lend commentary where appropriate. Some footage is from the cruise Robert Reed took the kids on (the trip where Greg tried to put the moves on Marcia, er, rather, Barry tried to put the moves on Maureen). Surprising it didn't air more than once, considering it rated well on it's first and only CBS airing.

While I thought that it definitely could have been longer, I also enjoyed it because I was able to see a new side to the Brady's, so to speak. And from someone who grew up with Brady's, at least in re-runs, it was fun to see them as actual kids, being goofy.If you missed this when it first aired, and are a Brady fan, it's definitely something that is worth watching. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because I feel it could have been longer, and wish that Maureen McCormick and Eve Plumb would have been with the rest of the cast during this little mini-reunion. However, as a plus, at the end, there are interviews with Susan Olsen and Mike Lookinland, that stretch to a pretty good portion, which is definitely another plus, as long as you are a Cindy and Bobby fan.",4,Another Side of the Brady Bunch,1207785600,"04 10, 2008",2008,841,"['remember', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'television', 'thought', 'definitely', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'new', 'side', 'Brady', 'so', 'speak', 'someone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Brady', 'least', 're-runs', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'actual', 'kids', 'being', 'goofy.If', 'missed', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'are', 'Brady', 'fan', 'definitely', 'something', 'worth', 'watching', 'only', 'reason', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'wish', 'Maureen', 'McCormick', 'Eve', 'Plumb', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'rest', 'cast', 'little', 'mini-reunion', 'However', 'plus', 'end', 'are', 'interviews', 'Susan', 'Olsen', 'Mike', 'Lookinland', 'stretch', 'pretty', 'good', 'portion', 'definitely', 'plus', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'Cindy', 'Bobby', 'fan']",Brady Home Movies
559093,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00004YA6Z,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","Brady Bunch Home Movies never would have been were it not for the fact that Robert Reed, who played the father on the hit series, was kind and generous enough to give out 8 mm cameras to everyone in the cast. Therefore, what we get here is roughly an hour of terrific ""home movie"" footage shot by the cast members (especially the child actors) as the series ran its course over several years; and it's great fun to watch this DVD. The pace of the footage flows along against the backdrop of a ""family reunion"" as most of the cast was able to get together much more recently to reminisce about the series. For example, they recall that the original title for the pilot episode was ""The Brady Brood"" instead of ""The Brady Bunch."" The quality of the 8 mm footage is certainly not the best but it's thoroughly entertaining and I enjoyed watching it tremendously.The footage is truly fascinating; we even get television footage of the actors before the series even began! There's a great clip of Ann B. Davis (who played Alice the homemaker on the series) acting on the Bob Cummings TV show for which she got two Emmys; and we see the majority of the child actors in TV commercials as well. There's also a good amount of footage shot when Robert Reed took the cast--at his own expense--to New York and then to London on the QE2; Reed wanted the children to understand and appreciate the arts and acting and he certainly succeeded. Even though Reed wasn't initially too keen on working with children, he became a father figure to them as they worked together.As far as extras go, there are the ""interviews with Bobby and Cindy."" These are professionally shot interviews with Mike Lookinland and Susan Olsen as they recall the show and their experiences while doing the show. It's a terrific extra feature.Overall, this is a must-have for fans of The Brady Bunch. Sadly, it is out of print as of the time I am writing this, but maybe that will change in time since the show is very often shown in syndication. Fans of the actors in this series will also want this for their collections.",5,"and the nostalgia continues--only this time, behind the scenes",1267315200,"02 28, 2010",2010,2079,"['Brady', 'Bunch', 'Home', 'Movies', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'were', 'not', 'fact', 'Robert', 'Reed', 'who', 'played', 'father', 'hit', 'series', 'was', 'kind', 'generous', 'enough', 'give', 'out', '8', 'mm', 'cameras', 'everyone', 'cast', 'Therefore', 'what', 'get', 'here', 'roughly', 'hour', 'terrific', 'home', 'movie', 'footage', 'shot', 'cast', 'members', 'especially', 'child', 'actors', 'series', 'ran', 'course', 'several', 'years', 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'DVD', 'pace', 'footage', 'backdrop', 'family', 'reunion', 'most', 'cast', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'together', 'much', 'more', 'recently', 'reminisce', 'series', 'example', 'recall', 'original', 'title', 'pilot', 'episode', 'was', 'Brady', 'Brood', 'instead', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'quality', '8', 'mm', 'footage', 'certainly', 'not', 'best', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'tremendously.The', 'footage', 'truly', 'fascinating', 'even', 'get', 'television', 'footage', 'actors', 'series', 'even', 'began', 'great', 'clip', 'Ann', 'B.', 'Davis', 'who', 'played', 'Alice', 'homemaker', 'series', 'acting', 'Bob', 'Cummings', 'TV', 'show', 'got', 'two', 'Emmys', 'see', 'majority', 'child', 'actors', 'TV', 'commercials', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'good', 'amount', 'footage', 'shot', 'when', 'Robert', 'Reed', 'took', 'cast', 'own', 'expense', 'New', 'York', 'then', 'London', 'QE2', 'Reed', 'wanted', 'children', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'arts', 'acting', 'certainly', 'succeeded', 'Even', 'Reed', 'was', ""n't"", 'initially', 'too', 'keen', 'working', 'children', 'became', 'father', 'figure', 'worked', 'together.As', 'far', 'extras', 'go', 'are', 'interviews', 'Bobby', 'Cindy', 'are', 'professionally', 'shot', 'interviews', 'Mike', 'Lookinland', 'Susan', 'Olsen', 'recall', 'show', 'experiences', 'doing', 'show', 'terrific', 'extra', 'feature.Overall', 'must-have', 'fans', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Sadly', 'print', 'time', 'am', 'writing', 'maybe', 'will', 'change', 'time', 'show', 'very', 'often', 'shown', 'syndication', 'Fans', 'actors', 'series', 'will', 'also', 'want', 'collections']",Brady Home Movies

This is a very entertaining documentery on the real lives of the Brady Bunch-when the cameras were not rolling. They were normal kids who liked to have fun. They were very good at goofing off-they were just being themselves.Robert Reed-who played the father-Mike Brady on the show gave each one of the kids super 8 cameras. They all made home movies with these cameras and now for the first time ever, several of these movies were compiled into this tv special. I find these home movies very fascinating. It shows what these kids were really like when they were not filming.I think the main thing about this special is that it shows how these kids established a chemistry on the show and why it worked so well. They liked being with each other even off the set. And so when one watches the Brady Bunch, it's easy to see that they had a great chemistry and that's what made them so believable.My favorite home movies here are those of Mike Lookinland(Bobby)this was one goofy kid when the cameras were not rolling. His home movie of the dogs and cats is very funny. It also shows why he is my favorite Brady kid-he was a real charmer!So, you want to know what these kiks were really like in real life?

Thus, unlike a lot of retrospective titles, this entry consistently keeps audience interest.As chronicled in Growing up Brady: I was a teenage Greg, these movies ultimately provided lot more realistic depiction of the six kids than anything Sherwood Schwartz wanted to produce. Like other teens their age, the 'Brady Bunch''s young actors coupled up and made out with each other There is some really interesting commentary on these films.Reed might have gained intra-set infamy for his opposition to bubblegum plotlines, but this is easily overshadowed by his genuine concern for all of the kids. Before he died of complications from AIDS, many of the kids honestly considered Reed their second father.
