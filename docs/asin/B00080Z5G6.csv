I like this walk DVD--it's easier than Jane Fonda's, but still gets your heart pumping, which is the goal.  Leslie even has the viewer take his/her pulse 3 times during the workout.  If you can stand and walk, you can do this one.  Only about 30 minutes from start to finish.At the beginning, Leslie's laughter is a little disconcerting--it sounds pretty fake, like she's nervous, working out with this crowd of people.  Go with it, because the workout is worth it.  But it is annoying the first time you hear it.",4,I like this walk DVD--it's easier than Jane Fonda's,1397865600,"04 19, 2014",2014,586,"['Leslie', 'Sansone', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'stuff', 'walk', 'DVD', 'easier', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'still', 'heart', 'pumping', 'goal', 'Leslie', 'even', 'viewer', 'take', 'his/her', 'pulse', '3', 'times', 'workout', 'can', 'stand', 'walk', 'can', 'do', 'one', 'Only', '30', 'minutes', 'start', 'finish.At', 'beginning', 'Leslie', 'laughter', 'little', 'disconcerting', 'pretty', 'fake', 'nervous', 'working', 'out', 'crowd', 'people', 'Go', 'workout', 'annoying', 'first', 'time', 'hear']",N/A

She has a few other Leslie Sansone DVDs but said this one fits her activity level better. Easier for her to follow and at a slower pace. She uses is several times a week.,4,gift for Mother,1371945600,"06 23, 2013",2013,250,"['did', ""n't"", 'use', 'video', 'bought', 'mother', 'who', 'just', 'turned', '80', 'few', 'other', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'DVDs', 'said', 'one', 'activity', 'level', 'better', 'Easier', 'follow', 'slower', 'pace', 'several', 'times', 'week']",N/A
