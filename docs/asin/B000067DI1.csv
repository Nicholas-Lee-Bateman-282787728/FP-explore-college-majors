702126,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B000067DI1,Carl Manes,"[0, 0]","WOLF GIRL, or BLOOD MOON, as it is known internationally, is one of the finest achievements in Gothic Horror to arrive in decades. This tragic tale centers Tara, an afflicted young woman whose hypertrichosis has gained her renown as the terrifying ""Wolf Girl"" in Harley Dune's Travelling Freak Show. After being tormented by a group of unruly teens at one of their stops, Tara is approached by a timid admirer, who claims he can help restore her looks using an experimental drug. Tara begins the treatments, but as she takes on a more human appearance, her instincts become more wild and animalistic as she regresses into the mindset of a wolf.WOLF GIRL is the most sincere and loving portrayal of human oddities since Tod Browning's FREAKS, exuding a sense of warmth and family between the players in Harley's sideshow. It places a firm emphasis on character and theme that only lightly touches on horror. Victoria Sanchez pours everything she has in to her performance as Tara, giving us a painfully sad and empathetic character with whom to relate. She wants nothing more than to be liked and to be loved, and is willing to risk her humanity if it means being accepted. Acceptance and appearance play a vital role in the development of the villains, as well. Through Beau and Krystal, we slowly begin to see the hidden imperfections that drive the teens to project their anxieties outwardly by attacking Tara. Interestingly enough, the characters with the most notable differences physically also show the most self-confidence and strength, as seen through Athena the Fat Lady and Ryan, Tara's scrawny but bold defender. Grace Jones performs a compelling music number that speaks towards inner beauty as the androgynous Christoph/Christine. Tim Curry is perfectly suited to play the role of the sideshow barker, Harley Dune, in another wonderful performance.All that aside, WOLF GIRL is a clever reversal of traditional werewolf lore that offers a refreshing new take on the genre. Lori Lansens provides a carefully crafted and character-driven script that is masterfully brought to life under the direction of Thom Fitzgerald. The film is magnificently shot under a dark Gothic aesthetic, from the beautiful costuming to the timeless carnival backdrop and fantastic score by Christophe Beck. This is essential viewing for any Gothic Horror or werewolf fans.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",5,ILHM Reviews: Blood Moon,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,2392,"['WOLF', 'GIRL', 'BLOOD', 'MOON', 'known', 'internationally', 'one', 'finest', 'achievements', 'Gothic', 'Horror', 'arrive', 'decades', 'tragic', 'tale', 'centers', 'Tara', 'afflicted', 'young', 'woman', 'hypertrichosis', 'gained', 'renown', 'terrifying', 'Wolf', 'Girl', 'Harley', 'Dune', 'Travelling', 'Freak', 'Show', 'being', 'tormented', 'group', 'unruly', 'teens', 'one', 'stops', 'Tara', 'approached', 'timid', 'admirer', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'restore', 'looks', 'using', 'experimental', 'drug', 'Tara', 'treatments', 'more', 'human', 'appearance', 'instincts', 'become', 'more', 'wild', 'animalistic', 'mindset', 'wolf.WOLF', 'GIRL', 'most', 'sincere', 'loving', 'portrayal', 'human', 'oddities', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'FREAKS', 'exuding', 'sense', 'warmth', 'family', 'players', 'Harley', 'sideshow', 'firm', 'emphasis', 'character', 'theme', 'only', 'lightly', 'horror', 'Victoria', 'Sanchez', 'everything', 'performance', 'Tara', 'giving', 'painfully', 'sad', 'empathetic', 'character', 'whom', 'relate', 'nothing', 'more', 'be', 'liked', 'be', 'loved', 'willing', 'risk', 'humanity', 'being', 'accepted', 'Acceptance', 'appearance', 'play', 'vital', 'role', 'development', 'villains', 'as', 'well', 'Beau', 'Krystal', 'slowly', 'begin', 'see', 'hidden', 'imperfections', 'drive', 'teens', 'project', 'anxieties', 'outwardly', 'attacking', 'Tara', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'characters', 'most', 'notable', 'differences', 'physically', 'also', 'show', 'most', 'self-confidence', 'strength', 'seen', 'Athena', 'Fat', 'Lady', 'Ryan', 'Tara', 'scrawny', 'bold', 'defender', 'Grace', 'Jones', 'compelling', 'music', 'number', 'towards', 'inner', 'beauty', 'androgynous', 'Christoph/Christine', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'play', 'role', 'sideshow', 'barker', 'Harley', 'Dune', 'wonderful', 'performance.All', 'aside', 'WOLF', 'GIRL', 'clever', 'reversal', 'traditional', 'werewolf', 'lore', 'refreshing', 'new', 'take', 'genre', 'Lori', 'Lansens', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'character-driven', 'script', 'masterfully', 'brought', 'life', 'direction', 'Thom', 'Fitzgerald', 'film', 'magnificently', 'shot', 'dark', 'Gothic', 'aesthetic', 'beautiful', 'costuming', 'timeless', 'carnival', 'backdrop', 'fantastic', 'score', 'Christophe', 'Beck', 'essential', 'viewing', 'Gothic', 'Horror', 'werewolf', 'fans.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",Blood Moon

The obligatory modern teen-flick shtick of pseudo-jock versus nerd is handled with an irony appropriate to the story, and the mad science versus ecology plot, though overstraining of credulity, is excusable in the midst of such a delightful hybrid of burlesque and horror.  The film is a feast for fans of Tim Curry, Grace Jones, and fat lady Darlene Cates, each of whom appears to relish his/her role.

702132,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B000067DI1,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","The original title for this movie is Wolf Girl.  It is not, as the alternate title and cover art suggest, a movie about a werewolf.  It is also not a horror movie.  The genre it could best be identified with is science fiction (tampering with medical science, abusing a drug with disastrous results).  And even with that, it doesn't nearly explore that aspect to the fullest.  It's also, oddly enough, a musical.  Tim Curry does a number, Grace Jones performs two songs, there's a couple of song and dance routines, all interspaced between acts of bullying and angst.  Most bizarre.  The gist of the story relates to the need to fit in, to be normal (what is normal?).  According to the premise provided, everyone is a freak in some regard.  In this instance, two characters will do anything to achieve normalcy or the appearance thereof.  Wolf Girl risks her life on a supposed cure while Beau (Shawn Ashmore), thinks nothing of resorting to murder to keep Wolf Girl from blabbing his secret abnormality.  The whole thing is handled in a curiously detached manner.  It's an odd way to present such an important issue.  In the end, it doesn't adequately convey the necessary desperation we all feel to fit in.The moral, careful what you wish for.I didn't mind watching it once, wouldn't want to watch it again, so glad I bought it cheap (used).",3,"""Harm her and I'll flatten you like a pancake!""",1374019200,"07 17, 2013",2013,1344,"['original', 'title', 'movie', 'Wolf', 'Girl', 'not', 'alternate', 'title', 'cover', 'art', 'suggest', 'movie', 'werewolf', 'also', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'genre', 'could', 'best', 'be', 'identified', 'science', 'fiction', 'tampering', 'medical', 'science', 'abusing', 'drug', 'disastrous', 'results', 'even', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'explore', 'aspect', 'fullest', 'also', 'oddly', 'enough', 'musical', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'number', 'Grace', 'Jones', 'performs', 'two', 'songs', 'couple', 'song', 'dance', 'routines', 'interspaced', 'acts', 'bullying', 'angst', 'Most', 'bizarre', 'gist', 'story', 'need', 'fit', 'be', 'normal', 'what', 'normal', 'According', 'premise', 'provided', 'everyone', 'freak', 'regard', 'instance', 'two', 'characters', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'achieve', 'normalcy', 'appearance', 'thereof', 'Wolf', 'Girl', 'life', 'supposed', 'cure', 'Beau', 'Shawn', 'Ashmore', 'nothing', 'resorting', 'murder', 'keep', 'Wolf', 'Girl', 'blabbing', 'secret', 'abnormality', 'whole', 'thing', 'handled', 'curiously', 'detached', 'manner', 'odd', 'way', 'present', 'important', 'issue', 'end', ""n't"", 'adequately', 'convey', 'necessary', 'desperation', 'feel', 'fit', 'in.The', 'moral', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'for.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'once', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'glad', 'bought', 'used']",Blood Moon
702133,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B000067DI1,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","User reviews led me to rent this movie thinking it would be a decent enough horror flick but that just wasn't the case. This made for Canadian TV piece has its heart in the right place but is a pretty awful mess when all is said and done.The story revolves around a ""Wolf Girl"" in a traveling side show that seems to be reaching the end of her rope as far as being an oddity is concerned. She wants to be normal. It just so happens a young outsider in a town in which the show makes camp has a mom who is working on treatment for losing unwanted hair. So they do the mad scientist thing and inject her with the serum even though it is untested and could have any number of horrible side effects. Yes, the stuff works and yes she has some pretty awful side effects, the main one being that she actually may be a werewolf and the serum might be bringing that to the surface.She exacts revenge, during a nocturnal tirade, on one of the locals who, with a few of his friends, taunted her during her performance.This, I suppose, is basically a good idea for a script, but it meanders terribly. There is nowhere near enough horror and her evolving relationship with her savior isn't explored well enough. They also spend too much time with the local degenerates who make all the trouble in the movie and show how they too are dysfunctional and have feelings of inadequacy. These people are buttholes and I don't want to sympathize with them. And why, after disrupting Wolf Girl's show one night by throwing excrement at her, is nothing done to them and they're allowed back into the show the following night? There are quite a few puzzling things like this happening throughout the film.Tim Curry does a decent enough job but his performance just doesn't overcome the tepid script.There are some OK moments here and there but the movie just doesn't seem settled on what it's trying to do so I say give this one a pass.

702134,ALY29A6CPLG2E,B000067DI1,Joe Niedbala,"[19, 19]","I rented this film solely on a chance and found myself really, really suprised at just how well done it was.Since, as of this writing, there is no plot synopsis here, I will include a brief one. A travelling sideshow, run by Tim Curry, pulls into a small town. It's star attraction is a young girl born covered in hair and billed as The Wolfgirl. She encounters taunts and threats from a group of young townie teenagers, as well as the posibility for a cure for her malady from the local misfit. The cure seems to work, but with the side effect that the previously gentle girl begins to experience more animalistic urges even as she physically becomes more ""human"".This film seems to have come out of nowhere. It actually saw life on the USA Network as ""Wolfgirl"". I hadn't heard of it under either title. Neither name is particularly good, but hey, it's nit picking. The film far outshines such a stuff for a number of reasons.The cast: Tim Curry is a perfect choice for Harley. He balances a desire for the financial survival of his show with a paternal love and respect for his performers. His is a colorful, yet flawed character, one whom you can easily both like and be angry with, and he makes it very believable. Grace Jones shows far more range than usual and makes great use of her androgeny in playing a half man/half woman. Darlene Cates, the mother from ""Gilbert Grape"" again amazes as Athena The Fat Lady. One wishes she could grace the screen more often. And Victoria Sanchez, as Tara The Wolfgirl, manages to truly seem beautiful beneath a full hairy make-up job. She is really phenomenal in a brave role for such a lovely looking young lady.The rest of the cast is equally talented, and I would speak more of them, but for the desire to compliment some very special members. The performers of the freak show are anything but freaks. With the exception of Sanchez and Jones, almost every other sideshow performer is the real deal, and they shine. We are given a chance to see these people in everyday mode, not just as part of the show. The family they portray is believable and breathtaking. Never are they shown in anything but the most repectful light and when they get individual chances to act within character, they are, to a one, believable. Of particular note is Jordan Prentice as Finger Finnian, Harley's right hand man. Not a single false note whenever he is on screen.The production: What an amazing-looking film! Marvelous production design gives the sideshow scenes an almost other-worldly quality. That the film was shot in Romania only adds to this old world feel within contemporary society. And Paul Jones' JoJo the Dog-Faced Boy make up design for Sanchez as the Wolfgirl is completely convincing. Really. Thom Fitzgerald's direction is biased towards the actors, as it should be here, but he also keeps the pace going and the details clear.The songs: The sideshow performances themselves are often in musical form with some delightfully bawdy and clever tunes by John Roby. It really gives the film a special touch. It's also great to hear Curry get to sing with the broadness that we remember from Rocky Horror. If there is a CD out there with these songs, I want it! There is also a great Ani DiFranco tune ofver the end credits.So, why does this film only get four stars after all this laudatory talk? The screenplay, while hitting the mark on the human end of things, seems to go slightly awry when it comes to the horror end of things. When there is violence or the like, it seems somwhat out of place, as if there was a story to tell, but that it was felt that it would only be marketable as a horror flick. It's too bad, because the emotional root is so strong (with the added idea that the ""freaks"", who are so obviously different, are not the ones with something to be ashamed of). Also, where are the police in this town? With all the delinquint juvvie activity, fearsome wolf attacks, etc., there's nary a cop in sight! Still, I would not hesitate to recommend this film. The four stars is relative to all other films, but that lack of a fifth should not be counted against it.One final note: This film was suprising in how little it held back in a number of areas, particularly nudity, which is sometimes used for a truly appropriate ""shock"". I didn't have a problem with it, but it was so unexpected (and I'm not spoiling anything here) and unique that I was a bit taken aback.

It made it out to be a splatter type werewolf film of the supernatural variety. Those of you who have seen it know that is far from the case. Nothing kills a movie faster than misrepresenting it to the audience. I'm guessing some ignorant studio suit didn't know how to sell this as it is and made a tragic mistake; as a result. While it does have some parallels with the legend of the werewolf, it's not remotely supernatural at all. Nor does it have anything to do with the phases of the moon or lunar eclipses as the title may suggest. Someone told me that it was originally called ""Wolf Girl,"" but I can't confirm that. It probably should have been though. With all that being said, what is this film really about? This delightfully strange film seems to be asking this question. Is inner and outer beauty mutually exclusive concepts? There's a little freak in us all, it's just more obvious in some than others. What ultimately defines us is how we treat the freak in us. Do we accept it, or do we do something truly ugly to hide it? That's what I got out of it, and I hope you do too, but if you're one who shuns the freak in us all; I doubt that you will. While watching this movie I got the impression that this may be a thickly veiled allegory of someone's actual life. I even got a hint of sour grapes in the way that the antagonists were portrayed.

A self-pitying loner? A pretty but socially inept blonde girl with no true friends? A cold-hearted scientist who experiments on animals to further her career in cosmetic science? A charismatic huckster who feels most comfortable surrounded by the physically deformed? And why would a sweet, gentle young girl willingly turn into a monster just to become beautiful? Why wouldn't she? A lot of people do.The only normal character in this film was the wolf (the real one), who mostly stood there looking bewildered at the antics of these crazy humans.This film has a surreal, old-world quality with an undertone of eugenics. In one short but chilling scene, a scientist delivers a speech to a room full of white-coated, zombie-ish colleagues, telling them that people don't want to just seem normal; they want to be normal, and that science can help them.

This scene is one marvelous and original idea that adds so much to the psyche of both the young man and the wolfgirl who witnesses his secret.  Shawn Ashmore (from ""X-Men"" and the current miniseries EARTHSEA) plays Beau, the aforementioned jock whose secrets (he's also scared silly in an earlier scene) become his downfall.BLOOD MOON is quite unusual in that it's not a ""werewolf"" movie; it's a story of those loveable ""freaks"" who have become sort of a dinosaur in today's more PC conscious society.  However, director Thom Fitzgerald has found a talented bunch of physically challenged people and given them human characteristics and some of them are delightful in their strange musical numbers.  Tim Curry does a fine job as the ringmaster Harley Dune, whose initial manipulation of these people gives way to a man who views them all his children.  Victoria Sanchez (Pact with the Devil) plays Tara, the wolfgirl who just wants to be normal; Dov Tieffenback plays Ryan, the introverted nerd whose mother (Lesley Ann Warren in a tiresome role) has come up with a genetic injection which is a depilatory that removes hair.  Grace Jones, that amazonian music star from the eighties, does a nice turn as Chris/Christina, a combination male female role which she is perfectly suited for.The movie's message is clearly ""Be pleased with who you really are.""

702145,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000067DI1,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[2, 3]","A horror movie about a travelling circus of sideshow performers - called 'freaks' by some - moving about from town to town, and cast with a number of actors and actresses with real physical differences, ""Blood Moon"" could have  easily come off extremely tasteless.  Thankfully, that isn't the case.  The circus, including a 'Wolf Girl' falsely depicted as a wild beast in her performances, find no shortage of people willing to be entertained by their performances but who are often (not all the spectators, but many) still very taunting of them. The selfcontained circus subsociety is a superior society to the behavior of the scummy louts encountered in one particular town they pass through,although it's here where the gentle Wolf Girl meets and becomes friends with an introverted teenage boy tormented by the local thugs.  It's also here that she finds an experimental cure for her wolflike appearance, and with the help of her new friend, begins experimenting with the new drug.  Also, very tellingly, although a number of the townspeople are not cruel, it's among the children that Tara and the other performers find the most open acceptance, not shy about their curiousity about the new arrivals but not in a frightened, mocking or downlooking way, and they're not uncomfortable around the circus people, whereas the adults usually are.  I find this true to the nature of little children, that they're interested in the different but haven't yet learned that they're 'supposed' to be at ill ease with others's differences.The acting in ""Blood Moon"" is absolutely tremendous.  The most famous player is Tim Curry (""It""; Dr. Frankenfurter from ""The Rock Horror Picture Show""; ""Earth 2"") and he turns in the performance of his career as the ringmaster of the circus, who at first glance appears to be an exploitive manipulator subjecting his performers for financial gain but is quickly revealed as a benevolent father-like figure to the troupe (other than his love interest, of course) who's spent his life offering a place to outcasts from society, within the circus where they can find camraderie and even be appreciated for their differences instead of pitied or ridiculed (occasional cretins within the spectators excluded).  The Wolf Girl herself he's even saved from possible death after she was born in a remote village somewhere in the world where superstition reigns strong (perhaps unrealistically strong, one of the movie's few gaps in realism) and she was regarded as some kind of demon. Every other performer is top-notch too - Victoria Sanchez is superb as Tara the Wolf Girl, Grace Jones plays the transgendered Cristophe/Christine, Darlene Cates gives a tender and manificent turn as Athena the 'Fat Lady' (a mother figure to Tara), and the actor who plays Tara's newfound friend/emerging love interest (I'm terribly sorry, but I can't recall the name of either the actor or the character) is great, and the four performers who play the band of bullies are also awardworthy.  In fact, everybody is tremendous but I felt the need to single certain main performers out.As the 'cure' begins to work for Tara, though, a certain beastiality begins to rise within her, and the already tense movie becomes one of the scariest films in memory, with fierce-hitting frights and truly unnerving suspense. ""Blood Moon"" is an unorthodox horror movie, and has managed to tread some difficult ground with style and class, and has a definate message - it's unsettlingly real how the most mean-spirited and nasty characters fit in with society and are accepted because they have the right look and are seen as cool, while others are shunned because they appear different from the norm, regardless of their character.On a final note, I'd like to praise the film's subtle yet beautiful romantic elements that find time to softly shine amid all the more disturbing and scary elements.  Tara and her love interest's initial friendship turning to unspoken attraction to each other is handled wonderfully; two hurt, lonely souls coming together in a very touching way that compares extremely well with any onscreen love story.  And I agree with what another reviewer said: even in her hairy wolflike state, Tara is very lovely.  A lovely character on the inside too, which makes her heartbreak at the way she's often treated all the more heartbreaking, and makes it all the more potent when the very uncharacteristic savagery begins to emerge inside her as a result of her cure attempt.",5,An Unexpected Masterpiece; Horror & Tragedy & Beauty,1101081600,"11 22, 2004",2004,4486,"['horror', 'movie', 'travelling', 'circus', 'sideshow', 'performers', 'called', ""'freaks"", 'moving', 'town', 'town', 'cast', 'number', 'actors', 'actresses', 'real', 'physical', 'differences', 'Blood', 'Moon', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'come', 'off', 'extremely', 'tasteless', 'Thankfully', ""n't"", 'case', 'circus', 'including', ""'Wolf"", 'Girl', 'falsely', 'depicted', 'wild', 'beast', 'performances', 'find', 'shortage', 'people', 'willing', 'be', 'entertained', 'performances', 'who', 'are', 'often', 'not', 'spectators', 'many', 'still', 'very', 'taunting', 'selfcontained', 'circus', 'subsociety', 'superior', 'society', 'behavior', 'scummy', 'encountered', 'one', 'particular', 'town', 'pass', 'here', 'where', 'gentle', 'Wolf', 'Girl', 'meets', 'friends', 'introverted', 'teenage', 'boy', 'tormented', 'local', 'thugs', 'also', 'here', 'experimental', 'cure', 'wolflike', 'appearance', 'help', 'new', 'friend', 'experimenting', 'new', 'drug', 'Also', 'very', 'tellingly', 'number', 'townspeople', 'are', 'not', 'cruel', 'children', 'Tara', 'other', 'performers', 'find', 'most', 'open', 'acceptance', 'not', 'shy', 'curiousity', 'new', 'arrivals', 'not', 'frightened', 'mocking', 'downlooking', 'way', ""'re"", 'not', 'uncomfortable', 'circus', 'people', 'adults', 'usually', 'are', 'find', 'true', 'nature', 'little', 'children', ""'re"", 'interested', 'different', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'learned', ""'re"", ""'supposed"", 'be', 'ill', 'ease', 'others', 'differences.The', 'acting', 'Blood', 'Moon', 'absolutely', 'tremendous', 'most', 'famous', 'player', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Dr.', 'Frankenfurter', 'Rock', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show', 'Earth', '2', 'performance', 'career', 'ringmaster', 'circus', 'who', 'first', 'glance', 'be', 'exploitive', 'manipulator', 'subjecting', 'performers', 'financial', 'gain', 'quickly', 'revealed', 'benevolent', 'father-like', 'figure', 'troupe', 'other', 'love', 'interest', 'course', 'who', 'spent', 'life', 'offering', 'place', 'outcasts', 'society', 'circus', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'camraderie', 'even', 'be', 'appreciated', 'differences', 'instead', 'pitied', 'ridiculed', 'occasional', 'cretins', 'spectators', 'excluded', 'Wolf', 'Girl', 'even', 'saved', 'possible', 'death', 'was', 'born', 'remote', 'village', 'somewhere', 'world', 'where', 'superstition', 'strong', 'perhaps', 'unrealistically', 'strong', 'one', 'movie', 'few', 'gaps', 'realism', 'was', 'regarded', 'kind', 'demon', 'other', 'performer', 'top-notch', 'too', 'Victoria', 'Sanchez', 'superb', 'Tara', 'Wolf', 'Girl', 'Grace', 'Jones', 'transgendered', 'Cristophe/Christine', 'Darlene', 'Cates', 'tender', 'manificent', 'turn', 'Athena', ""'Fat"", 'Lady', 'mother', 'figure', 'Tara', 'actor', 'who', 'Tara', 'newfound', 'friend/emerging', 'love', 'interest', ""'m"", 'terribly', 'sorry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'name', 'actor', 'character', 'great', 'four', 'performers', 'who', 'play', 'band', 'bullies', 'are', 'also', 'awardworthy', 'fact', 'everybody', 'tremendous', 'felt', 'need', 'single', 'certain', 'main', 'performers', 'out.As', ""'cure"", 'begins', 'work', 'Tara', 'though', 'certain', 'beastiality', 'rise', 'already', 'tense', 'movie', 'one', 'scariest', 'films', 'memory', 'fierce-hitting', 'frights', 'truly', 'unnerving', 'suspense', 'Blood', 'Moon', 'unorthodox', 'horror', 'movie', 'managed', 'tread', 'difficult', 'ground', 'style', 'class', 'definate', 'message', 'unsettlingly', 'real', 'how', 'most', 'mean-spirited', 'nasty', 'characters', 'fit', 'society', 'are', 'accepted', 'have', 'right', 'look', 'are', 'seen', 'cool', 'others', 'are', 'shunned', 'appear', 'different', 'norm', 'regardless', 'character.On', 'final', 'note', ""'d"", 'like', 'praise', 'film', 'subtle', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'romantic', 'elements', 'find', 'time', 'softly', 'shine', 'more', 'disturbing', 'scary', 'elements', 'Tara', 'love', 'interest', 'initial', 'friendship', 'turning', 'unspoken', 'attraction', 'other', 'handled', 'wonderfully', 'two', 'hurt', 'lonely', 'souls', 'coming', 'together', 'very', 'touching', 'way', 'extremely', 'well', 'onscreen', 'love', 'story', 'agree', 'what', 'reviewer', 'said', 'even', 'hairy', 'wolflike', 'state', 'Tara', 'very', 'lovely', 'A', 'lovely', 'character', 'inside', 'too', 'heartbreak', 'way', 'often', 'treated', 'more', 'heartbreaking', 'more', 'potent', 'when', 'very', 'uncharacteristic', 'savagery', 'emerge', 'inside', 'result', 'cure', 'attempt']",Blood Moon
