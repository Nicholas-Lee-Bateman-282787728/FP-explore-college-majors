1005533,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000GNOHG4,A Customer,"[15, 18]","Although it takes a bit long to get off the ground, and it never really explains what it is really about, The Great New Wonderful is a sometimes quirky, always bittersweet exercise in how New Yorkers are soldiering on after September 11th. The portrait is one of melancholy as this disparate and eclectic group of people from all walks of life goes through their paces, consistently jumpy, often frightened and always sad.For five sets of New Yorkers life in September 2002 is still just as much of a struggle as it was after that terrible day on 2001. Two youthful and nice parents Allison (Judy Geer) and David Burbage (Tom McCarthy) are at the end of their tether emotionally. As their sex life gradually diminishes, they spend their days worrying about their ten-year-old hyperactive son Charlie (Billy Donner) who is disobedient at home and violent to his classmates at school.Sandie (Jim Gaffigan) is a mild-mannered but tightly wound survivor of 9/11 - apparently he worked on the seventh floor of the World Trade Center. Things would be fine except for the goading of a dotty therapist (Tony Shalhoub) his employers have forced him to consult. Emme (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is an astute and ruthless young cake decorator who owns The Great New Wonderful, a pastry company that has lost out to the Queen of Cake, Safarah (Edie Falco).Judy Berman (Olympia Dukakis) is a working class senior who is forced to put up with her mechanical husband who does nothing but watch television all day and after dinner retire to the terrace for a smoke. They do not talk and the only thing that keeps Judy going is the artwork she does in their small kitchen. One day, a childhood friend bumps into her, and they reconnect, their friendship perhaps a harbinger of hope.Best friends Avi (Naseerudin Shah) and Satish (Sharat Saxena) are working class immigrants, who work as security guards and minders for diplomats, particularly for an Indian general who is currently visiting New York City. But their friendship is threatened when Satish is inappropriately rough with a Japanese tourist. Then Avi confesses that he had sex with a young woman and now feels guilty about it.As these people go about their lives, some of them occasionally cross paths, most particularly in an elevator that stalls between floors, and when a plane flies low overhead, they become wary and frightened. The characters in this drama written by Sam Catlin are very fragile and vulnerable people who often react in anger and violence and who are still trying to live with the consequences of grief.All are faced with difficult choices and decisions and when things do not go the way they want, they either react with violence or frustration. For the most part, they seem to be avoiding the trauma of 9/11. Not all the little stories and vignettes work - some are even a bit boring in places - but most of the performances, especially a haughty luncheon under a veil of politeness with Gyllenhaal and Falco, are spot on, involving and very revealing.

A wry smile is maybe the most rise it may give you. Made in the wake of 9/11, it tries to comment on how that made things different for a diverse group of New Yorkers. Each storyline is separate and doesn't overlap, so it keeps cutting between them all, picking up the pace as the film progresses.

I know some reviewers seem to think that Sandie is a 9/11 survivor, but on the therapist referring to what happened on the 7th floor, that afternoon, makes me think he isn't one. It was still morning, not quite 10:30, when the North Tower collapsed. And, I don't think the 7th floor of either Tower was unduly affected by the airplane impacts 70+ floors above. And, 7 WTC, across from the main WTC complex was probably evacuated before either Tower collapsed.

However, to use the title in a different way, I'd have to say the movie is far from great, not at all new, and there's nothing wonderful about it.  Okay... to be serious...  I found this movie in a $3.99 bin.  I had never heard of it, but I bought it because I like the actors in it, the cover description makes it sound really funny and it was cheap.  Cheap, yes.  Funny, no.  It's only mildly amusing and mildly engaging with certain characters, which I shall point out, herein.  This is basically a group of stories of individual characters.  With the exception of a few of them meeting in an elevator, their stories do not intertwine.  Maybe, if the characters and their individual stories DID intertwine or have notable connections, the movie might be a better feature.  But, as it stands, it's just separate stories thrown together on one film.  I disliked the majority of the movie for the characters of Emme, David & Allison and Sandie (although Jim Gaffigan does a good job in his portrayal).  Of those characters, I did like the character of Sandie's therapist, Dr. Trabulous (played perfectly by Tony Shalhoub).  I also liked the story of the two foreign security guards Avi & Satish (Naseeruddin Shah & Sharat Saxena).  Their characters (and their story) are the most interesting and fun to watch.  I also liked the character of Judy (played brilliantly by Olympia Dukakis), the down-trodden, unappreciated elderly wife of her elderly husband who is set in a mundane routine.  She spends her time cutting out pictures and pasting them onto canvases as a collage painting.  (It might be nice to see more of that.)  Trying to watch the whole movie is difficult, because most of it is boring and not well done.  But, fortunately, the DVD has the redeeming bonus features which actually present each of the stories in individual formats.  So, you can go to the Bonus Features of the DVD and watch, for example, Judy's Story or Avi & Satish's Story (my favorite two out of the five).  These are re-edited versions from the movie, which simply edit out all but the bits with those characters, allowing you to watch their story, without the distraction of the other stories in the movie.  On the whole, it's not worth buying this movie, but it is worth renting it.",2,"Good acting, some nice characters, but a bad movie.",1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,2346,"['title', 'refers', 'name', 'company', 'owned', 'one', 'characters', 'However', 'use', 'title', 'different', 'way', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'far', 'great', 'not', 'new', 'nothing', 'wonderful', 'be', 'serious', 'found', 'movie', '3.99', 'bin', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'bought', 'like', 'actors', 'cover', 'description', 'sound', 'really', 'funny', 'was', 'cheap', 'Cheap', 'yes', 'Funny', 'only', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'mildly', 'engaging', 'certain', 'characters', 'shall', 'point', 'out', 'herein', 'basically', 'group', 'stories', 'individual', 'characters', 'exception', 'few', 'meeting', 'elevator', 'stories', 'do', 'not', 'intertwine', 'Maybe', 'characters', 'individual', 'stories', 'DID', 'intertwine', 'have', 'notable', 'connections', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'feature', 'just', 'separate', 'stories', 'thrown', 'together', 'one', 'film', 'disliked', 'majority', 'movie', 'characters', 'Emme', 'David', 'Allison', 'Sandie', 'Jim', 'Gaffigan', 'good', 'job', 'portrayal', 'characters', 'did', 'character', 'Sandie', 'therapist', 'Dr.', 'Trabulous', 'played', 'perfectly', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'also', 'liked', 'story', 'two', 'foreign', 'security', 'guards', 'Avi', 'Satish', 'Naseeruddin', 'Shah', 'Sharat', 'Saxena', 'characters', 'story', 'are', 'most', 'interesting', 'fun', 'watch', 'also', 'liked', 'character', 'Judy', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'down-trodden', 'unappreciated', 'elderly', 'wife', 'elderly', 'husband', 'who', 'set', 'mundane', 'routine', 'time', 'cutting', 'out', 'pictures', 'pasting', 'onto', 'canvases', 'collage', 'painting', 'might', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'Trying', 'watch', 'whole', 'movie', 'difficult', 'most', 'boring', 'not', 'well', 'done', 'fortunately', 'DVD', 'redeeming', 'bonus', 'features', 'actually', 'present', 'stories', 'individual', 'formats', 'So', 'can', 'go', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'DVD', 'watch', 'example', 'Judy', 'Story', 'Avi', 'Satish', 'Story', 'favorite', 'two', 'five', 'are', 're-edited', 'versions', 'movie', 'simply', 'out', 'bits', 'characters', 'allowing', 'watch', 'story', 'distraction', 'other', 'stories', 'movie', 'whole', 'not', 'worth', 'buying', 'movie', 'worth', 'renting']",The Great New Wonderful

1005539,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000GNOHG4,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 4]","It's admirable that director Danny Leiner and screenwriter Sam Catlin have attempted to tackle the inarticulate emotional toll that 9/11 has taken on a group of New Yorkers rather than tell a more visceral story directly related to the tragedy (like Paul Greengrass' ""United 93"" or Oliver Stone's ""World Trade Center""). Unfortunately, the filmmakers' intended cathartic exercise falls significantly short due to a too-subtle patchwork narrative and the film's relentlessly enervating pace. Five unconnected stories begin a year after 9/11, and we are taken through the characters' paces in dealing with some form of emotional denial. The most pertinent thread is initially the most comic one in which a seemingly well-adjusted office worker named Sandie talks to a sardonic psychologist, Dr. Trabulous, about the impact of the tragedy.The other episodes are somewhat more removed from the events of that day - Avi and Satish, a couple of bickering Indian security agents overseeing the speaking engagement of a foreign diplomat; a married couple, David and Allison, whose overweight adolescent son Charlie has become socially dysfunctional; Judie, an older woman in Brooklyn quietly seething about her tedious marriage as she seeks the company of Jerry, an old schoolmate; and an upscale cake designer named Emme who is trying to land a big client at the expense of her famous rival, Safarah. None of the stories really connect with each other except for a rather contrived scene in an elevator, though that seems to be the filmmakers' point, that the scope of 9/11 affected each of their immediate situations in idiosyncratic ways. The movie only runs 87 minutes, but it takes at least an hour for the stories to take shape toward some common dramatic point. Even then, it still feels too nebulous to make a resonant emotional impact, and consequently, the opportunity for catharsis feels frittered away.It's not for the lack of a good cast. Stand-up comic Jim Gaffigan brings out Sandie's inner torment palpably as Tony Shalhoub listens with oblique bemusement; Maggie Gyllenhaal displays the steely shallowness of Emme as she faces an unexpected turn; Naseeruddin Shah and Sharat Saxena dexterously show their characters' opposing views on life and what secrets may lie beneath; Judy Greer and Tom McCarthy bring surprising depth to a couple confounded by their son's eruptive violence; and Olympia Dukakis is stoic strength personified as Judie. Edie Falco has nothing more than a cameo as Safarah, but her moments count. New York City is captured crisply by cinematographer Harlan Bosmajian on high-definition video. The DVD has a rather informal but somewhat interesting commentary track by Leiner and Catlin, as well as several deleted scenes and unused footage of the city. An intriguing extra is the ability to watch each of the five episodes separately as individual shorts. There is also the theatrical trailer, a gallery of stills accompanied by the soundtrack, and a helpful blurb about the outreach program organized to deal with post-9/11 trauma.",3,Good Cast Cannot Hide Story Deficiencies in an Omnibus Look at Post-9/11 Trauma,1161561600,"10 23, 2006",2006,3061,"['admirable', 'director', 'Danny', 'Leiner', 'screenwriter', 'Sam', 'Catlin', 'have', 'attempted', 'tackle', 'inarticulate', 'emotional', 'toll', '9/11', 'taken', 'group', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'rather', 'tell', 'more', 'visceral', 'story', 'directly', 'related', 'tragedy', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'United', '93', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'Unfortunately', 'filmmakers', 'intended', 'cathartic', 'exercise', 'significantly', 'short', 'due', 'too-subtle', 'patchwork', 'narrative', 'film', 'relentlessly', 'enervating', 'pace', 'Five', 'unconnected', 'stories', 'begin', 'year', '9/11', 'are', 'taken', 'characters', 'paces', 'dealing', 'form', 'emotional', 'denial', 'most', 'pertinent', 'thread', 'initially', 'most', 'comic', 'one', 'seemingly', 'well-adjusted', 'office', 'worker', 'named', 'Sandie', 'talks', 'sardonic', 'psychologist', 'Dr.', 'Trabulous', 'impact', 'tragedy.The', 'other', 'episodes', 'are', 'somewhat', 'more', 'removed', 'events', 'day', 'Avi', 'Satish', 'couple', 'bickering', 'Indian', 'security', 'agents', 'overseeing', 'speaking', 'engagement', 'foreign', 'diplomat', 'married', 'couple', 'David', 'Allison', 'overweight', 'adolescent', 'son', 'Charlie', 'become', 'socially', 'dysfunctional', 'Judie', 'older', 'woman', 'Brooklyn', 'quietly', 'seething', 'tedious', 'marriage', 'company', 'Jerry', 'old', 'schoolmate', 'upscale', 'cake', 'designer', 'named', 'Emme', 'who', 'trying', 'land', 'big', 'client', 'expense', 'famous', 'rival', 'Safarah', 'None', 'stories', 'really', 'connect', 'other', 'rather', 'contrived', 'scene', 'elevator', 'be', 'filmmakers', 'point', 'scope', '9/11', 'affected', 'immediate', 'situations', 'idiosyncratic', 'ways', 'movie', 'only', '87', 'minutes', 'least', 'hour', 'stories', 'take', 'shape', 'common', 'dramatic', 'point', 'Even', 'then', 'still', 'too', 'nebulous', 'make', 'resonant', 'emotional', 'impact', 'consequently', 'opportunity', 'catharsis', 'feels', 'frittered', 'away.It', 'not', 'lack', 'good', 'cast', 'Stand-up', 'comic', 'Jim', 'Gaffigan', 'out', 'Sandie', 'inner', 'torment', 'palpably', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'oblique', 'bemusement', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'steely', 'shallowness', 'Emme', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'Naseeruddin', 'Shah', 'Sharat', 'Saxena', 'dexterously', 'show', 'characters', 'opposing', 'views', 'life', 'what', 'secrets', 'may', 'lie', 'beneath', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'Tom', 'McCarthy', 'bring', 'surprising', 'depth', 'couple', 'confounded', 'son', 'eruptive', 'violence', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'stoic', 'strength', 'personified', 'Judie', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'nothing', 'more', 'cameo', 'Safarah', 'moments', 'count', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'captured', 'crisply', 'cinematographer', 'Harlan', 'Bosmajian', 'high-definition', 'video', 'DVD', 'rather', 'informal', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'track', 'Leiner', 'Catlin', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'unused', 'footage', 'city', 'intriguing', 'extra', 'ability', 'watch', 'five', 'episodes', 'separately', 'individual', 'shorts', 'also', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'gallery', 'stills', 'accompanied', 'soundtrack', 'helpful', 'blurb', 'outreach', 'program', 'organized', 'deal', 'post-9/11', 'trauma']",The Great New Wonderful
1005540,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000GNOHG4,Grady Harp,"[6, 9]","Danny Leiner has provided us with a quiet little collection of stories written by first-time writer Sam Catlin in the form of overlapping lives of people one year from the trauma of 9/11.  Though billed as a comedy, the 'comedy' comes more from the nuances of reality that has settled into Manhattan and the world since that treacherous event.  Yes, there are humorous moments in these collected tales, but there is always a dark side that predominates, largely due to not only to the fine script and directing, but also to an amazingly gifted cast of ensemble actors.September 2002, Manhattan, and we gradually meet a psychiatrist (Tony Shalhoub) as he 'interrogates' a sugar addicted man with internalized anger issues (Jim Gaffigan); two fragilely connected parents (Judy Greer and Tom McCarthy) coping with their obese sociopathic young son; the elderly Judie (Olympia Dukakis) coping with her boring and distant husband; two competing pastry chefs (Maggie Gyllenhaal and Edie Falco) whose vapid lives are focused on creating cakes for silly events; and two Indian bodyguards (Naseeruddin Shah and Sharat Saxena) who spend their days protecting officials while dealing with home front crises.  How these five stories develop and overlap in the early days of September demonstrate how ordinary people have been coping with the incomprehensible act of a year ago.  As the first year anniversary of that event arrives, each of the five stories reaches its own peak with its individual climaxes of action and the subtlety in which each ordinary tale plays out is mesmerizing.There are no major insights here, no noisy confrontations with the seed act that occurred, just life among survivors doing what they have done to make it through another year.  Every role is played with aplomb by this fine cast of actors - each knowing just when to let the heart show and the courage work itself out. It is a gentle film that allows us to reflect and think about how we all have handled the unimaginable.  Highly recommended.

1005542,AOKKY21CAQVGM,B000GNOHG4,Jim&Yvonne,"[5, 9]","""The ""Lame"" New Wonderful,"" A movie with some great acting with an assemble cast lacks in the department of storytelling.  Another movie that deals with the horrific 9/11 attacks, actually the year following 9/11 near the one year anniversary of everyday New Yorkers trying to ""cope"" with living in a city in which such tragedy occurred within the previous year.  The movie dealt with little of people who actually knew someone who died in the attacks, had little really to deal with 9/11 except for portions in which a psychologist is crisis counseling an employee that had a near, well, close call.  There is no doubt that New Yorkers felt stressed during the time being portrayed in the movie and probably even today still, but besides the above reference and the overhead shots of planes and the thunderous roaring sounds engines of large planes in the background, this movie had really little to deal with 9/11.  What it dealt with is every day stresses of life, of who you want to be and how precious and delicate life really is.  Maggie G. was great in it, the rest of the cast was OK, but what it lacked in storytelling did not make up in emotion except for one particular part in which a couple of (spoiler) parents give up on a child--The only real emotional scene in the entire movie.  Independent movie it was, but unfortunately, this independent movie didn't fair as well as others has been of late.  As for the 9/11 subplot, my belief is it was thrown in and referenced just a couple times in the movie to gain an audience.  The best 9/11 movies that I have seen are ""United 93"" and the TV mini-series ""The Path to 9/11.""  I purchased this movie on pay-per-view because I was really bored.  I love dialog driven movies, but this movies dialog was sub par, boring and in my view exploitive in using the attacks of 9/11 as a selling point for seeing the movie.  This movie was just awful, awfully boring, and awfully tedious to watch.

1005545,A1YUL9PCJR3JTY,B000GNOHG4,"O. Brown ""Ms. O. Khannah-Brown""","[8, 9]","*****This movie is not for everyone. It is being billed as an ""intelligent comedy"" and I would not call it that. It is more of an intelligent drama with dark comedic overtones. If you are looking for a ha-ha funny comedy, don't get this movie, as it is not light-hearted, either, as the name implies. However, for the right viewer, I would have to say that it really is a great movie, it is absolutely new, and I found it wonderful, too.The movie is ostensibly about five New Yorkers and the details of their lives a year after 9/11. These characters were not involved in the 9/11 tragedy directly, but it shows how the stress of just living in the city where this tragedy happened has affected each of their lives and the conclusions about their lives they've arrived at by the end of the movie. The five stories interweave but can be watched separately in the special features section. I highly recommend watching them together, though, because there are parallel elements between the stories, even though at first they are not obvious. In general, I see this film as being about the stress of living our lives today, and the choices we make about our problems.Now, here's why I think this movie is not getting rave reviews---when I watched it the first time I thought ""This is just dumb""...in other words, I didn't get it at all---but since then, I've never had a movie haunt me so much. The more I think about it the more meaning I find in it. Have you ever watched a movie like that? I usually either love them or feel like I've wasted my time. So this movie is definitely different. It is subtle and profound, and has to ""sink in"". If you have someone to watch movies with who enjoys discussing them afterwards (and your friend is pretty intelligent and introspective), then the experience will be even better. I cannot stop thinking about it, which is a new experience for me.The acting is fantastic, and includes a cast of respected actors (see the description of their past roles above).I rented it first, and then bought it, which I would recommend. If you are the right viewer, watching this movie will be a new experience for you, one that will make you think about life in general, and one you will never forget. You'll want to watch all the special features, and the movie over and over again.*****",5,"For the Right Viewer---Great, New, AND Wonderful",1178150400,"05 3, 2007",2007,2312,"['*****This', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'being', 'billed', 'intelligent', 'comedy', 'would', 'not', 'call', 'more', 'intelligent', 'drama', 'dark', 'comedic', 'overtones', 'are', 'looking', 'ha-ha', 'funny', 'comedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie', 'not', 'light-hearted', 'either', 'name', 'implies', 'However', 'right', 'viewer', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'new', 'found', 'wonderful', 'too.The', 'movie', 'ostensibly', 'about', 'five', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'details', 'lives', 'year', '9/11', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'involved', '9/11', 'tragedy', 'directly', 'how', 'stress', 'just', 'living', 'city', 'where', 'tragedy', 'happened', 'affected', 'lives', 'conclusions', 'lives', ""'ve"", 'arrived', 'end', 'movie', 'five', 'stories', 'interweave', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'separately', 'special', 'features', 'section', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'together', 'though', 'are', 'parallel', 'elements', 'stories', 'even', 'first', 'are', 'not', 'obvious', 'general', 'see', 'film', 'being', 'stress', 'living', 'lives', 'today', 'choices', 'make', 'problems.Now', 'here', 'why', 'think', 'movie', 'not', 'getting', 'rave', 'reviews', '-when', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'thought', 'just', 'dumb', 'other', 'words', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', '-but', 'then', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'movie', 'haunt', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'think', 'more', 'meaning', 'find', 'Have', 'ever', 'watched', 'movie', 'usually', 'love', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'wasted', 'time', 'So', 'movie', 'definitely', 'different', 'subtle', 'profound', 'sink', 'have', 'someone', 'watch', 'movies', 'who', 'enjoys', 'discussing', 'afterwards', 'friend', 'pretty', 'intelligent', 'introspective', 'then', 'experience', 'will', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'thinking', 'new', 'experience', 'me.The', 'acting', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'respected', 'actors', 'see', 'description', 'past', 'roles', '.I', 'rented', 'first', 'then', 'bought', 'would', 'recommend', 'are', 'right', 'viewer', 'watching', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'new', 'experience', 'one', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'life', 'general', 'one', 'will', 'never', 'forget', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'special', 'features', 'movie', 'over', 'again', '*****']",The Great New Wonderful

This movie was neither Great, nor Wonderful. And as soon as it is no longer considered ""new,"" it will be zero out of three.I wanted to enjoy the movie. For most of the movie I enjoyed the characters and felt for them in certain scenarios. Something was just missing. Well, I figure two things were missing: cohesion and closure.I can appreciate the idea of many smaller stories combined to form one bigger super-movie. Maybe I am just used to seeing it more when the stories have some common element. These stories never intertwined and nothing, except the emotional roller coaster of life in The Big Apple was the same for any of the characters.There were emotional highs and lows. Hopes were exalted and dashed. And all the while...nothing really happened. There was no story; we simply follow a few people on their day-to-day routines and see the happiness and pain they experience at whatever intervals they experience them.And then the movie ends. That's it.Well to be fair they showed one more scene that only serves to compound the abundance of loose ends and detract from any feeling of compassion. I won't spoil the final scene, but it was not the most ""pro-family"" scene I have ever watched.The movie does have a decent list of names associated with it. Probably my favorite of the bunch is Jim Gaffigan. He may not be the funniest comedian, but I have enjoyed seeing him in what I can when I can. He and Tony Shalhoub bantered well together as doctor and patient. Their story was a little forced, but the two had good chemistry.Maggie Gyllenhaal is finally beginning to grow on me. Or then again it might just be the part she played was much more...wholesome than roles she has had in the past (e.g. Happy Endings)It certainly would take much more than additional witty banter from Jim Gaffigan and wholesomeness from Maggie Gyllenhaal to even make The Great New Wonderful into A Movie Worth Seeing.

Shame on the folks responsible,  for exploiting the tragedy of 9/11 by using it to showcase this bunch of freaks.  Even the wonderful Tony Shalhoub merely played ""Mr. Monk becomes a Therapist.""  Don't know what ever happened to the Psycho Child,  but by the end of the film he's gone,  which is where I should have been long before the closing song.",1,"""A heart made out of sand and s*** """,1170115200,"01 30, 2007",2007,729,"['did', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'line', 'was', 'movie', 'best', 'line', 'movie', 'opinion', 'beleaguered', 'school', 'principal', 'finally', 'cuts', 'loose', 'clueless', 'couple', 'horrid', 'heinous', 'child', 'really', 'need', 'major', 'help', 'line', 'perfectly', 'sums', 'up', 'really', 'awful', 'film', 'peopled', 'most', 'unappealing', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lately', 'Shame', 'folks', 'responsible', 'exploiting', 'tragedy', '9/11', 'using', 'showcase', 'bunch', 'freaks', 'Even', 'wonderful', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'merely', 'played', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Therapist', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'ever', 'happened', 'Psycho', 'Child', 'end', 'film', 'gone', 'where', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'long', 'closing', 'song']",The Great New Wonderful
