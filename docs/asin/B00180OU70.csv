Erland,"[11, 13]","Think of the film `Flakes' (`07) as an undated, more hip version of the now defunct but still popular, long running television series `Cheers' only with a vast and varied cereal menu rather than alcoholic beverages. Join store manager Neil Downs (Aaron Stanford) girlfriend Pussy Katz (Zooey Deschanel), owner Willie (Christopher Lloyd) and a zany group of New Orleans residents as they gather daily for a bowl of their favorite cereal.The shop is but a launching pad for a pithy, intelligent, romantic comedy, coming of age storyline that I enjoyed immensely. `Flakes' only shortcoming is the finish. Which isn't necessarily bad, but I just don't think it quite lives up to what preceded it.This one will stand up well to repeat viewings, which ultimately is the supreme test for any film.

1158375,A205BECZCE6DAU,B00180OU70,"Dennis M. Roy ""animation addict""","[0, 1]","This is a fun little indie film. I did not have huge expectations, but bought it because the price was right (less than 5 bucks!), and because I am a fan of ""New Girl"" Zooey Deschanel. But mostly because of the fact that I am a huge fan of breakfast cereals. It was great to see that they researched the topic a little, and there are numerous famous old cereals making an appearance in the film. It's a little unrealistic in terms of the fact that the manager of Flakes (a hipster hangout restaurant that serves only breakfast cereal) purchases 30-year old unopened boxes of cereals that are no longer made (at a fraction of what they'd be valued at by cereal box collectors) and then OPENS THEM AND SERVES THEM TO CUSTOMERS.  I mean seriously, would you eat breakfast cereal that was 30 years old like Quake or Freakies? Not to mention that unopened boxes of these cereals are as scarce as hen's teeth -- you certainly couldn't run a restaurant depending on discovering old unopened boxes of the stuff, not to mention what you'd have to charge for a bowl of it in order to make a profit, even if it was safe to sell to the public (I wonder what the Health Department would say about selling 30 year old breakfast cereal).But this is just picking nits, and you really shouldn't get too bogged down in the logical details of the plot. Bottom line, it's a fun little movie, as long as your expectations are not too high. Zooey Deschanel is enchanting as always, and Christopher Lloyd heads a cast of colorful quirky characters. I wasn't familiar with Aaron Stanford's previous work but he was good in this. The music soundtrack was just OK (your mileage may vary) - not great but not annoyingly intrusive either.",4,Zooey + cereal = FUN,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,1710,"['fun', 'little', 'indie', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'huge', 'expectations', 'bought', 'price', 'was', 'right', 'less', '5', 'bucks', 'am', 'fan', 'New', 'Girl', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'mostly', 'fact', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'breakfast', 'cereals', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'researched', 'topic', 'little', 'are', 'numerous', 'famous', 'old', 'cereals', 'making', 'appearance', 'film', 'little', 'unrealistic', 'terms', 'fact', 'manager', 'Flakes', 'hipster', 'hangout', 'restaurant', 'only', 'breakfast', 'cereal', 'purchases', '30-year', 'old', 'unopened', 'boxes', 'cereals', 'are', 'longer', 'made', 'fraction', 'what', ""'d"", 'be', 'valued', 'cereal', 'box', 'collectors', 'then', 'OPENS', 'THEM', 'AND', 'SERVES', 'THEM', 'TO', 'CUSTOMERS', 'mean', 'seriously', 'would', 'eat', 'breakfast', 'cereal', 'was', '30', 'years', 'old', 'Quake', 'Freakies', 'Not', 'mention', 'unopened', 'boxes', 'cereals', 'are', 'as', 'scarce', 'hen', 'teeth', 'certainly', 'could', ""n't"", 'run', 'restaurant', 'depending', 'discovering', 'old', 'unopened', 'boxes', 'stuff', 'not', 'mention', 'what', ""'d"", 'have', 'charge', 'bowl', 'order', 'make', 'profit', 'even', 'was', 'safe', 'sell', 'public', 'wonder', 'what', 'Health', 'Department', 'would', 'say', 'selling', '30', 'year', 'old', 'breakfast', 'cereal', '.But', 'just', 'picking', 'nits', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'bogged', 'down', 'logical', 'details', 'plot', 'Bottom', 'line', 'fun', 'little', 'movie', 'as', 'long', 'expectations', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'high', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'enchanting', 'always', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'cast', 'colorful', 'quirky', 'characters', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'Aaron', 'Stanford', 'previous', 'work', 'was', 'good', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'just', 'OK', 'mileage', 'may', 'vary', 'not', 'great', 'not', 'annoyingly', 'intrusive', 'either']",Flakes

Zwick,"[1, 3]","**1/2According to financial records released by the studio, Michael Lehmann`s ""Flakes"" raked in all of $778 in box office revenue when it was released in late 2007.  And although one hates to kick a well-intentioned, low budget film when it's down, the truth is that ""Flakes"" is a cute idea that doesn't really amount to all that much in the long run.  In fact, the film is so benign and innocuous that it seems to be evaporating even as you're watching it.Neal Downs (Aaron Stanford) is a struggling musician who works as manager of a little New Orleans eatery called Flakes (owned by Christopher Lloyd) that serves nothing but cold cereal to its loyal clientele.  When a rival franchise opens up across the street, Neal's girlfriend, the self-named Pussy Katz (Zooey Deschanel), applies for a job at the new establishment as a means of getting back at Neal for refusing to hire her at his own place.The pro-capitalist vs. anti-capitalist theme that runs through the storyline is halfhearted and underdeveloped at best.  Moreover, while the cast is engaging and appealing (especially Deschanel), the undernourished Chris Poche/Karey Kirkpatrick screenplay doesn't give the actors a whole lot of solid material to work with.  And even the relatively fresh and novel New Orleans setting isn't exploited as much as it could be for its old-world atmosphere and charm.",2,the very definition of an innocuous film,1255564800,"10 15, 2009",2009,1364,"['**1/2According', 'financial', 'records', 'released', 'studio', 'Michael', 'Lehmann', 's', 'Flakes', 'raked', '778', 'box', 'office', 'revenue', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'late', '2007', 'one', 'kick', 'well-intentioned', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'when', 'down', 'truth', 'Flakes', 'cute', 'idea', ""n't"", 'really', 'amount', 'that', 'much', 'long', 'run', 'fact', 'film', 'so', 'benign', 'innocuous', 'be', 'evaporating', 'even', ""'re"", 'watching', 'it.Neal', 'Downs', 'Aaron', 'Stanford', 'struggling', 'musician', 'who', 'manager', 'little', 'New', 'Orleans', 'eatery', 'called', 'Flakes', 'owned', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'nothing', 'cold', 'cereal', 'loyal', 'clientele', 'When', 'rival', 'franchise', 'up', 'street', 'Neal', 'girlfriend', 'self-named', 'Pussy', 'Katz', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'applies', 'job', 'new', 'establishment', 'means', 'getting', 'back', 'Neal', 'refusing', 'hire', 'own', 'place.The', 'pro-capitalist', 'anti-capitalist', 'theme', 'storyline', 'halfhearted', 'underdeveloped', 'best', 'Moreover', 'cast', 'engaging', 'appealing', 'especially', 'Deschanel', 'undernourished', 'Chris', 'Poche/Karey', 'Kirkpatrick', 'screenplay', ""n't"", 'give', 'actors', 'whole', 'lot', 'solid', 'material', 'work', 'even', 'relatively', 'fresh', 'novel', 'New', 'Orleans', 'setting', ""n't"", 'exploited', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'be', 'old-world', 'atmosphere', 'charm']",Flakes
