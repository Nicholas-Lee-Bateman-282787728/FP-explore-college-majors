1607265,A1MFDFUGEVNIFK,B00AAQ7JNA,AyJay,"[1, 2]","What can I say? I went to a concert for Rihanna's Loud tour and was disappointed by the sound; the music was too loud to hear clearly, and Rihanna's lyrics were very quiet and were mumbled - at one point, and I'm not exaggerating, I genuinely had no idea what song was being performed. I put the problems down to the venue and the possibility that Rihanna was simply ill on the night of the concert that I attended, so watched my sister's copy of this dvd to see what the concert should be like...... Well now I know that the sound issues weren't down to the particular venue - the dvd has iffy sound too, so the problem must lie with the tour equipment. Sure in comparison to the live experience the sound on the dvd is good, but in comparison to other concert dvds it is sort of muffled. Kind of like hearing something underwater.Plus Rihanna wasn't ill on the night I saw her. Sorry to Rihanna fans, but I think that this dvd shows that she's just not all that. Sure; she sounds great on her albums, but she is a bit all over the place live. The vocals are there at times [especially for the final third of the show], but she doesn't have a lot of control over them.***With  the dvd I spent more time looking beyond the sound issues and was left underwhelmed by the Loud show as a whole. The set pieces were random and blend-in-the-background dark, the costumes were dull, the dancing was the usual 'dry humping' and the set list was boring - she picked too many of her filler songs to perform.To sum it up; the dvd bored me and helped me make up my mind not to waste money on another Rihanna concert.",2,Rihanna by numbers...,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,1604,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'went', 'concert', 'Rihanna', 'Loud', 'tour', 'was', 'disappointed', 'sound', 'music', 'was', 'too', 'loud', 'hear', 'clearly', 'Rihanna', 'lyrics', 'were', 'very', 'quiet', 'were', 'mumbled', 'one', 'point', ""'m"", 'not', 'exaggerating', 'genuinely', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'song', 'was', 'being', 'performed', 'put', 'problems', 'down', 'venue', 'possibility', 'Rihanna', 'was', 'simply', 'ill', 'night', 'concert', 'attended', 'so', 'watched', 'sister', 'copy', 'dvd', 'see', 'what', 'concert', 'should', 'be', 'Well', 'now', 'know', 'sound', 'issues', 'were', ""n't"", 'down', 'particular', 'venue', 'dvd', 'iffy', 'sound', 'too', 'problem', 'must', 'lie', 'tour', 'equipment', 'Sure', 'comparison', 'live', 'experience', 'sound', 'dvd', 'good', 'comparison', 'other', 'concert', 'dvds', 'sort', 'muffled', 'Kind', 'hearing', 'something', 'underwater.Plus', 'Rihanna', 'was', ""n't"", 'ill', 'night', 'saw', 'Sorry', 'Rihanna', 'fans', 'think', 'dvd', 'just', 'not', 'Sure', 'great', 'albums', 'bit', 'place', 'live', 'vocals', 'are', 'there', 'times', '[', 'especially', 'final', 'third', 'show', ']', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'control', '***With', 'dvd', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'looking', 'sound', 'issues', 'was', 'left', 'underwhelmed', 'Loud', 'show', 'whole', 'set', 'pieces', 'were', 'random', 'blend-in-the-background', 'dark', 'costumes', 'were', 'dull', 'dancing', 'was', 'usual', 'humping', 'set', 'list', 'was', 'boring', 'picked', 'too', 'many', 'filler', 'songs', 'perform.To', 'sum', 'up', 'dvd', 'bored', 'helped', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'not', 'waste', 'money', 'Rihanna', 'concert']",N/A

The concert itself is excellent and she does a great job of the performance and skiing but the sound quality was NOT Blu-ray quality; it sounded like a regular DVD if that.  Alot of people complained about the sound quality and made me hesitate to buy it, but I enjoy her music too much to pass it up.  I knew the sound quality was off when I put in another Blu-ray concert (Yanni) and the sound quality of the Blu-ray was stunning compared to this.I hope Rihanna's managers are reading these reviews and fire the company who made this DVD sound.  Every single other Blu-ray concert DVD I have sounds better than this one.

1607269,A246BU2DG7JC8I,B00AAQ7JNA,J. Walsh,"[4, 10]","Let's be honest... in the creation of this Blu Ray, corners were certainly cut in the audio quality put onto the disc.  Was this a mistake or on purpose?  I do not know... however... this is a technical issue.  Step away from that.  Is it listenable audio even if not all it could have been? YES.  May you have to crank your system to get it loud?  YES.  Could it use more bottom end?  YES.  Does the mix do the songs and musicianship full justice?  No. But, does it still sound good?  YES.  It is funny... most people are buying MP3s which dumb down the audio quality... and then are going to worry about the sound quality here?  To most people, the sound issues on this Blu Ray are not going to make the product unenjoyable.This product is about the concert and the documentation of the Loud Tour.  I am so thankful it exists in a flawed version rather than not at all.  Why?  Because it was THE BEST concert I EVER saw.  I am over 40 and have been attending concerts for decades and have seen the best of the best and average 10 arena concerts a year live and countless at smaller venues along with countless ones viewed on TV or DVD/Blu Ray.  Rihanna's Loud Tour had EVERYTHING you could possibly want in an arena show.  Great stage that was neither simplistic nor overly complicated... it just looked great and complimented the show and artist.  The large movable circle screens, outlined stage lighting, synched video footage, and all the rest was great.  Then you add in the occasional props for certain songs.  You add in backup dancers used appropriately in and between songs.  You ensure the music is played by top notch musicians including a world class guitarist in Nuno Bettencourt (Extreme).  Add in spot on backing vocals to keep the sound thick and accurate to the recorded versions.  Now, add in the fact that all these awesome musicians end up creating versions of the songs that surpass the studio version in quality (unfortunately slightly harder to tell with the poor audio mix, I will admit).  Add in elevating stage areas and treadmills, etc... have the stage configuration change regularly... change the outfits regularly... and add some great use of smoke, lighting and even a little pyro and even confetti.  It basically had everything you would want in a concert... and all this is before even mentioning Rihanna.  She rocks... her moves are great, she is fun to watch, and she never gets enough credit for her singing.  Unlike the lip synchers out there, she does her moves and her singing and she doesn't hide where she weaves in and out of the backup singers.  Rihanna has a very unique voice and a perfect blend of control and swagger and looseness in her performances.  She is as made to be on stage as Michael Jackson was.  And she commands the same stop and watch attention.  To top all of that off... Rihanna has a crazy amount of hits and Loud was probably the last tour that will feature a mix of hits and a few other great songs that were not big singles but kick butt live.  By now, Rihanna can fill an entire show with just her hit singles... and the only negative will eventually be (probably starting with this next tour) that she will have to leave many great songs unplayed.  Not a bad problem to have.  Anyway... why focus on the negatives of this release compared to the positives??  It was imperative that this tour be documented and available for historical purposes. If you judge this release by the show itself... you will LOVE it... and if someday they release a better audio blu ray... I bet you will buy that too because this show is THAT GOOD!It is sad that the concert itself is not earning the 5 stars it easily deserves purely due to the technical issues many are pointing out.  As a concert, honestly, even trying here, I still couldn't possibly say enough to convey how great the Loud Tour was.  I saw it live... 4th row center in Chicago, it was beyond amazing... and being able to re-live it with this Blu Ray really makes it my favorite Blu Ray in my collection... problems and all.",5,Awesome CONCERT... don't be swayed by negative reviews of the audio,1357516800,"01 7, 2013",2013,4044,"['Let', 'be', 'honest', 'creation', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'corners', 'were', 'certainly', 'cut', 'audio', 'quality', 'put', 'disc', 'Was', 'mistake', 'purpose', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'however', 'technical', 'issue', 'Step', 'away', 'listenable', 'audio', 'even', 'not', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'YES', 'May', 'have', 'crank', 'system', 'get', 'loud', 'YES', 'Could', 'use', 'more', 'bottom', 'end', 'YES', 'mix', 'do', 'songs', 'musicianship', 'full', 'justice', 'No', 'still', 'sound', 'good', 'YES', 'funny', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'buying', 'MP3s', 'dumb', 'down', 'audio', 'quality', 'then', 'are', 'going', 'worry', 'sound', 'quality', 'here', 'most', 'people', 'sound', 'issues', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'make', 'product', 'unenjoyable.This', 'product', 'concert', 'documentation', 'Loud', 'Tour', 'am', 'so', 'thankful', 'flawed', 'version', 'rather', 'not', 'Why', 'was', 'THE', 'BEST', 'concert', 'EVER', 'saw', 'am', '40', 'have', 'been', 'attending', 'concerts', 'decades', 'have', 'seen', 'best', 'best', 'average', '10', 'arena', 'concerts', 'year', 'live', 'countless', 'smaller', 'venues', 'countless', 'ones', 'viewed', 'TV', 'DVD/Blu', 'Ray', 'Rihanna', 'Loud', 'Tour', 'had', 'EVERYTHING', 'could', 'possibly', 'want', 'arena', 'show', 'Great', 'stage', 'was', 'simplistic', 'overly', 'complicated', 'just', 'looked', 'great', 'complimented', 'show', 'artist', 'large', 'movable', 'circle', 'screens', 'outlined', 'stage', 'lighting', 'synched', 'video', 'footage', 'rest', 'was', 'great', 'Then', 'add', 'occasional', 'props', 'certain', 'songs', 'add', 'backup', 'dancers', 'used', 'appropriately', 'songs', 'ensure', 'music', 'played', 'top', 'notch', 'musicians', 'including', 'world', 'class', 'guitarist', 'Nuno', 'Bettencourt', 'Extreme', 'Add', 'spot', 'backing', 'vocals', 'keep', 'sound', 'thick', 'accurate', 'recorded', 'versions', 'Now', 'add', 'fact', 'awesome', 'musicians', 'end', 'up', 'creating', 'versions', 'songs', 'surpass', 'studio', 'version', 'quality', 'unfortunately', 'slightly', 'harder', 'tell', 'poor', 'audio', 'mix', 'will', 'admit', 'Add', 'elevating', 'stage', 'areas', 'treadmills', 'etc', 'have', 'stage', 'configuration', 'change', 'regularly', 'change', 'outfits', 'regularly', 'add', 'great', 'use', 'smoke', 'lighting', 'even', 'little', 'pyro', 'even', 'confetti', 'basically', 'had', 'everything', 'would', 'want', 'concert', 'before', 'even', 'mentioning', 'Rihanna', 'moves', 'are', 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'never', 'enough', 'credit', 'singing', 'lip', 'there', 'moves', 'singing', ""n't"", 'hide', 'where', 'backup', 'singers', 'Rihanna', 'very', 'unique', 'voice', 'perfect', 'blend', 'control', 'swagger', 'looseness', 'performances', 'as', 'made', 'be', 'stage', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'was', 'same', 'stop', 'watch', 'attention', 'top', 'off', 'Rihanna', 'crazy', 'amount', 'hits', 'Loud', 'was', 'probably', 'last', 'tour', 'will', 'feature', 'mix', 'hits', 'few', 'other', 'great', 'songs', 'were', 'not', 'big', 'singles', 'kick', 'butt', 'live', 'now', 'Rihanna', 'can', 'fill', 'entire', 'show', 'just', 'hit', 'singles', 'only', 'negative', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'probably', 'starting', 'next', 'tour', 'will', 'have', 'leave', 'many', 'great', 'songs', 'unplayed', 'Not', 'bad', 'problem', 'have', 'Anyway', 'why', 'focus', 'negatives', 'release', 'compared', 'positives', 'was', 'imperative', 'tour', 'be', 'documented', 'available', 'historical', 'purposes', 'judge', 'release', 'show', 'will', 'LOVE', 'someday', 'release', 'better', 'audio', 'blu', 'ray', 'bet', 'will', 'buy', 'too', 'show', 'GOOD', 'sad', 'concert', 'not', 'earning', '5', 'stars', 'easily', 'purely', 'due', 'technical', 'issues', 'many', 'are', 'pointing', 'out', 'concert', 'honestly', 'even', 'trying', 'here', 'still', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'say', 'enough', 'convey', 'how', 'great', 'Loud', 'Tour', 'was', 'saw', 'live', '4th', 'row', 'center', 'Chicago', 'was', 'amazing', 'being', 'able', 're-live', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'really', 'favorite', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'collection', 'problems']",N/A

Wasn't really happy that she left out Darling Nikki and the Glamorous life, tho. I don't know if it's because those aren't her songs. She also left out Run This Town and Live your life. She's very good at energizing the crowd and especially love the interaction she has with her audience. For example, she takes pics of her fans and then herself and gives them back their camera. How sweet. What other pop star does that? Another one, she does a lapdance on her female fans..well actually rides on them, lol. They were just giggling with excitement. It reminds me of when I was watching the All For You tour on dvd and Janet was riding on a male fan during her Do You Mind performance, lol. The only difference is Rihanna did it on two girls. At times, she reminded me of Madonna, Whitney, and Bob Marley all in one. Her vocals were good and she sang live. I would say the Loud tour is much more developed and established than her Good Girl Gone Bad tour. This one would make a great add to your Rihanna collection. They should also release her Last Girl on Earth tour on dvd.
