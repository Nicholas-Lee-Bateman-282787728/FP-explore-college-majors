1430075,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004VMUX6O,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[43, 43]","In many ways, this literary adaptation (or interpretation) must be accepted on its own terms to be truly appreciated.  If you are a D.H. Lawrence purist, you may be upset with some of the liberties taken with the source material.  That said, I found this two-parter courtesy of BBC absolutely fascinating.  Melding themes and story lines from both ""The Rainbow"" and ""Women in Love"" into something that feels distinctly different from both the book and the notorious Ken Russell film from 1969, this is more like a complete re-imaging from the feminine perspective.  If that thought discourages you, maybe it's best that you steer clear.  If, however, you enter into this experience with an open mind and a lack of preconceived expectations, there is much to be admired in this handsome film.Presented in two segments, each part of ""Women in Love"" is somewhat self contained.  In Part One, we meet the Brangwen family, their friends, and those in the surrounding community.  The piece examines a number of diverse relationships in varying states of metamorphosis.  The sisters who will become the centerpiece of the story (played by Rosamund Pike and Rachael Stirling) are part of a larger ensemble.  And some of the supporting story threads are really great.  I particularly thought that the depiction of the girls' parents was strong, memorable and completely satisfying.  We also meet charming Gerald Crich (Joseph Mawle) and repressed Rupert Birkin (Rory Kinnear) among others.  The story doesn't shy away from the unpleasantness, the sexuality, and/or the complexity of any of the central characters.  As the foursome come together, despite some obvious difficulties, you know that happily ever after may not be in the offing.  Part Two pretty much reduces to these four pairing off and squaring off in a series of psychological confrontations set across a barren landscape.Part of what makes this version of ""Women in Love"" work is the screenplay that allows for a good amount of time to really delve into all of the principle characters.  It really understands the emotional devastation that makes these four tick.  When they come together or fly apart, it always seems like a predetermined part of who these people are.  Pike, in particular, has the unenviable position of being compared to Glenda Jackson (who won an Oscar for this role).  But it's a completely different interpretation, more soft, more cunning.  Stirling, in many ways, is the heart of this story and she's terrific.  In fact, she keeps getting better as the show progresses.  I also particularly liked Mawle for the danger and despair that lurked just beneath the surface.  At times, this is a challenging and very adult presentation.  As this is D.H. Lawrence, I don't think I have to warn you about the overt sexual content and nudity, but I will.  Even the infamous male-on-male nude wrestling scene is here, but in a slightly different context.  Well made and well acted, an easy recommendation for adult audiences.  KGHarris, 3/12.",4,A Two Part British Miniseries: Taking On A D.H.

Lawrence's legendary controversial novel, WOMEN IN LOVE is a powerful 2-part miniseries that follows the romantic and erotic adventures of two sisters from Britain's industrial Midlands, Ursula and Gudrun Brangwen, during the years before, during and following World War I.  This three-hour production also incorporates aspects of Lawrence's earlier banned novel, THE RAINBOW, which deals with the same characters.This production, adapted by William Ivory and directed by Miranda Bowen, is remarkably different to the two films of Lawrence's novels that were directed by Ken Russell in 1969 (WOMEN IN LOVE) and 1989 (THE RAINBOW), both of which co-starred Glenda Jackson.It's been several years since I've seen either movie, but as I recall, unlike in this new version, there were no World War I battle scenes, nor did the 1969 picture delve into the confused sexual identity of Rupert Birkin, played in the original version by Alan Bates and in this one by Rory Kinnear.  Also, the final scenes in the movie took place on the mountains of Switzerland, whereas the ending of the miniseries is set in South Africa where the production was shot.This new WOMEN IN LOVE is a magnificent, bold production, filled with exquisite performances by a superb cast.  Rosamund Pike (Gundrun) and Rachael Stirling (Ursula) are two of the finest actresses working today, and each brings a unique vulnerability and sensuality to their individual roles.  Indeed, Ms. Pike may give us a softer Gundrun than did Glenda Jackson, who won an Oscar for her portrayal, yet her Gundrun can be just as unfeeling and dangerous to the men she ensnares.Kinnear, Joseph Mawle (as Gerald Crich, the role played by Oliver Reed in the 1969 film) and Saskia Reeves (as the sexually-frustrated mother of the sisters) are all excellent.Be advised that this production has some very graphic sexual scenes that include both male and female full frontal nudity.From BBC Video.

1430078,A1GHO6BR5J0NHX,B004VMUX6O,Richard Masloski,"[2, 6]","This BBC lead balloon based on two D.H. Lawrence novels has almost nothing to recommend it.  The acting is high school amateurish, the directing is consistent in its one-note dullness, the dialog is often hard to understand (at least there are subtitles), the music score is incredibly insipid, the script muddled and none of the leads are in any way likeable.  There is no feeling that any of the four main characters knows anything whatsoever about one another - or cares a whit about each other.  In this yawner, there is naught of love or romance or sexual charge or desire - despite a lot of full-frontal nudity from both genders. It is a miniseries shot by the numbers and with little care - watch Gerald's dead dad's eyes blink a couple of times as one example of the general carelessness of the production.  The World War One trench warfare scene was so unrealistic that I thought it was a dream/nightmare sequence instead.  The nude seashore battle twixt Gerald and Rupert is filled with incomprehensible dialog that merely serves to irritate one.  There are many, many garbled scenes actually. Gerald's final trek to oblivion is an exercise in pure pretentiousness.  Ursula wears but one expression through the entire film, looking like she is in dire need of an enema.  Rupert is stripped of all his philosophic complexity and charm, thus rendering him a eunuch more than a fully-sexed man or the intended mouthpiece of Lawrence himself.  Gerald looks like Danny Bonaduce smashed into Vincent van Gogh and is boring beyond belief.  And Gudrun seems like malice aforethought throughout the entire unidimensional undertaking - an undertaking that seriously needs an undertaker!  The best part of the entire thing was the relationship betwixt Mr. and Mrs. Brangwen which is developed in part one - and then completely dropped in part two - which was just another example of the general carelessness at work herein.Steer clear of this dead weight.
