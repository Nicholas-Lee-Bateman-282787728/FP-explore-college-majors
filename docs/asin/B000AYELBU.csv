935122,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000AYELBU,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[11, 12]","This DVD features two Pilates practices.  Unfortunately, they seemed to be geared to different levels, and the second is much better overall.The first workout is Lower Body Pilates by instructor Jillian Hessel. She begins by going through a brief review of posture principles, and then the workout itself starts with some nice foot and leg stretches while lying on your back. Next, Jillian moves into some of the traditional Pilates mat exercises, focusing mainly on moves that work the legs, such as leg circles and bicycle. Some non-traditional mat exercises are included, such as opening and closing the legs in a straddle position. Jillian also performs the Pilates side kick series, including exercises that focus on both the outer and the inner thighs; there are also a few movements performed lying face down to work the back of the legs. The workout ends with a short standing balance segment, coming in at just under 29 minutes. Overall, this workout wasn't very challenging, but it might work for those who enjoyed thighs segment from Crunch Pick Your Spot Pilates and/or who are looking for a lower body workout that is not very strenuous.The second workout, Pilates Abs, is led by Ana Caban, and it is one of her most challenging workouts. It consists entirely of matwork and begins immediately with the hundred exercise. Ana then moves through a traditional matwork sequence, including moves such as the roll-up, the roll-over, rolling like a ball, the series of five, and the teaser. For many of the moves, Ana adds a more challenging twist--eg, performing several of the series of five exercises with no arms, doing the open-legged rocker with closed legs as well, etc. Because this is an abs-focused workout, the Pilates side kick series and back extension moves are not included. Ana ends the workout with a unique combination move which is a compilation of rolling like a ball, open-legged rocker, the teaser, and lowering down a rope; she then ends with a few brief stretches to bring the workout in at just under 24 minutes. Although Ana works out with an assistant, Tara, who shows modifications for some of the movements, this is an intermediate Pilates workout and should not be attempted by those new to Pilates.Unless you are already familiar with both of the workouts included on this DVD, I would recommend purchasing them separately according to which one would best meet your needs.",4,"One great Pilates workout, one average",1191196800,"10 1, 2007",2007,2411,"['DVD', 'two', 'Pilates', 'practices', 'Unfortunately', 'seemed', 'be', 'geared', 'different', 'levels', 'second', 'much', 'better', 'overall.The', 'first', 'workout', 'Lower', 'Body', 'Pilates', 'instructor', 'Jillian', 'Hessel', 'going', 'brief', 'review', 'posture', 'principles', 'then', 'workout', 'nice', 'foot', 'leg', 'stretches', 'lying', 'back', 'Next', 'Jillian', 'moves', 'traditional', 'Pilates', 'mat', 'exercises', 'focusing', 'mainly', 'moves', 'work', 'legs', 'such', 'leg', 'circles', 'bicycle', 'non-traditional', 'mat', 'exercises', 'are', 'included', 'such', 'opening', 'closing', 'legs', 'straddle', 'position', 'Jillian', 'also', 'Pilates', 'side', 'kick', 'series', 'including', 'exercises', 'focus', 'outer', 'inner', 'thighs', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'movements', 'performed', 'lying', 'face', 'down', 'work', 'back', 'legs', 'workout', 'short', 'standing', 'balance', 'segment', 'coming', 'just', '29', 'minutes', 'Overall', 'workout', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'challenging', 'might', 'work', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'thighs', 'segment', 'Crunch', 'Pick', 'Your', 'Spot', 'Pilates', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'lower', 'body', 'not', 'very', 'strenuous.The', 'second', 'workout', 'Pilates', 'Abs', 'led', 'Ana', 'Caban', 'one', 'most', 'challenging', 'workouts', 'entirely', 'matwork', 'immediately', 'hundred', 'exercise', 'Ana', 'then', 'traditional', 'matwork', 'sequence', 'including', 'moves', 'such', 'roll-up', 'roll-over', 'rolling', 'ball', 'series', 'five', 'teaser', 'many', 'moves', 'Ana', 'more', 'challenging', 'twist', 'eg', 'performing', 'several', 'series', 'five', 'exercises', 'arms', 'doing', 'open-legged', 'rocker', 'closed', 'legs', 'as', 'well', 'etc', 'abs-focused', 'workout', 'Pilates', 'side', 'kick', 'series', 'back', 'extension', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'Ana', 'workout', 'unique', 'combination', 'move', 'compilation', 'rolling', 'ball', 'open-legged', 'rocker', 'teaser', 'lowering', 'down', 'rope', 'then', 'few', 'brief', 'stretches', 'bring', 'workout', 'just', '24', 'minutes', 'Ana', 'out', 'assistant', 'Tara', 'who', 'modifications', 'movements', 'intermediate', 'Pilates', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'attempted', 'new', 'Pilates.Unless', 'are', 'already', 'familiar', 'workouts', 'included', 'DVD', 'would', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'separately', 'according', 'would', 'best', 'meet', 'needs']",Pilates Sculpt & Tone Collection: Lower Body Workout / Abs Workout
