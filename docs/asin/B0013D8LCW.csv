1141099,A3KBG7E1XSNTYC,B0013D8LCW,,"[5, 5]","This is a sweet, romantic film that will make you feel good inside.  The acting is all great, with all of the characters ringing very true.  My one complaint is that I could tell at times that the two lead actors are straight in real life. They seemed uncomfortable in some of the kissing scenes and like they couldn't wait to get it over with.  That said, it's a very enjoyable story about real people, real lives and real love.  The two leads are appealing and have great chemistry. Tina Holmes is a terrific actress and does a great job as the unlikeable, self centered mother who doesn't much care about her kid.  Though at the end, she also does a good job of showing the character as conflicted and sad, and lets a little of her ""mom"" side through.  What really grabbed me about this film is that it isn't some gimmicky film, or something about incredible events that would never happen in real life. It's simply about people falling in love and making the best of their situations.

In one of my reviews, I said Robert Pattinson's character and his girlfriend should have waited till they were a lot older before they made love (the movie is called Remember Me). Well, I enjoyed this movie. It's just that I do not know where I stand in this issue anymore, but to go straight to the point, I thought the love between Zach and Shaun was very beautiful. Zach has this glow when he's with Shaun, which I love seeing (especially when they cuddle & kiss and they play Shane Mack's Lie To Me). The movie is romantic and funny and has some drama, which works for me. I just don't understand why Zach's sister is keeping a guy that clearly doesn't like her son and little boys shouldn't be starting cars (at the beginning Zach told Cody to go and start his car).

Zach often dreams of leaving it all behind and pushes away his best friend and girlfriend, brooding and resigning himself to a life supporting all those around him while neglecting himself. He finds ""shelter"" so to speak in his art, surfing and skating, spending time with his young nephew who calls him ""daddy"", and eventually in the arms of an older wiser man named Shaun.Shaun is a struggling writer visiting the beach to recover from a breakup. He is Zach's best friend's brother, and the two hit it off when they bump into one another on the beach. What follows is a touching, sexy trip as Zach realizes who he is and finds a way to break out of the rut he is in with the help of his lover and two best friends.""Shelter"" isn't perfect, but it is a huge step forward as far as gay love stories go in my opinion. Zach and Shaun are believable characters. Self-loathing, panicking parents, and stereotypes are washed out to sea in this gay film that focuses mainly on the drama and struggles of everyday life. Zach especially is a great character, trying to hold it together and do what is best for everyone he loves.

Added with luscious backdrops of San Pedro beaches, surfings, sunsets, AND AMAZING soundtrack - this is basically what gay-themed movies I have long wished for.Because falling in love could be gentle, beautiful and rewarding - even among M/M. Sometimes there is no need for over-the-top or dramatic situation. This movie is also a story about commitment to other family members and acceptance of one's sexual preference over the other.Both main actors make the relationship work and truly believable. The sex is romantic and sensual without having to show full body nudity. When it comes to that first love making, you can feel the tension that lead up to there and it's perfect.

I have since watched the film many times at home, again introducing as many people as I could to it.My opinion of the film has, since recently, changed ever so slightly though.I'm not sure the film was nearly as brilliant as i (and judging by the reviews on Amazon everyone else who saw it) thought it was.If you think about it, the story isn't that original, virtually every gay film of the last 10 years sings the same tune. And while Shelter is better executed than most other films of this genre (both gay and straight), its inherent weakness shows as the film caves in on itself mid way (as soon as the first obstacle arises)Despite this, I do still believe that Shelter is worth seeing, as mentioned, the film is well made. The direction in the first half is sturdy, the cinematography, although hardly sublime, places you as the viewer in the perfect mood, and I loved most of the music used.

It is well paced with great sound and picture quality, impeccable direction, a lovely story, and a cast of actors perfectly suited for their roles.Three of the main characters here (Zack, Jeanne, and Cody)are a family living together in a very humble section of San Pedro, CA which is in Los Angeles County. A beautiful, selfless young Gay man, Zack, has put his life on hold to look after his adorable nephew Cody whose mother, played by Tina Holmes, is an irresponsible, self-centered alcoholic with deplorable taste in men.  But his compassion and love are well rewarded when an older gorgeous hunk and surfing buddy, Shaun, reunites with him and eventually becomes his mentor, his ""rock"", and his lover as well a wonderful role model and support system for his little nephew.In real life, Trevor Wright(""Zack"") and Brad Rowe(""Shaun"") are both heterosexual and are actually 12 years apart in age. If Brad Pitt makes you drool, so will Brad Rowe, and if you love a perfectly beautiful young man with the face of an angel and a smile that lights up a room like a Christmas tree, you'll love Trevor Wright.  Also, if you like Tina Holmes, I would suggest you check out another great movie, ""Edge of Seventeen"" in which she appears as a teen in love with her male ""BFF"" who comes out to her as gay.It would be a grave injustice to dismiss this wonderful movie as just another ""coming out"" film. It's a tribute to the power of love that can be enjoyed and embraced by all open-minded audiences who appreciate a feel good romance with a happy ending.From my vantage point, having a collection films about love and romance without ""Shelter"" would be like having a collection of classic cars without a vintage Pink Cadillac.

1141112,A2X29H96X7C3XJ,B0013D8LCW,"Blue in Washington ""Barry Ballow""","[3, 4]","""Shelter"" has a lot going for it.  An interesting and credible screenplay, an attractive and professional cast, some excellent surfing action footage and impressive outdoor settings.  Most of all, it succeeds in establishing characters that the viewer comes to care about a great deal.  The story goes well beyond some of the usual gay coming of age genre flicks.  It avoids soft porn titillation and sexual fantasy in favor of presenting the developing affection between the two lead characters--Zach and Shaun.  And it does not pretend that there are not other things going on in those characters' lives.  In the case of Zach, a major load of family obligations while facing of a bleak future.The film also demonstrates--pretty accurately in California, at least--the transition from rejection to unconditional acceptance that gay and lesbian people are seeing these days.  The unquestioning reassurance that best friend Gabe (Shaun's brother) gives to Zach is touching and, I think, not unrealistic for that generation.  This is repeated later by Torrey, Zach's girlfriend.  This kind of acceptance was unimaginable for most gay people 20 or even 15 years ago.  It is extremely touching and gratifying to see it expressed now.""Shelter"" is a very good indie film that fully deserves its apparent success.  There have been many gay genre films that have covered the same material but without the skill and sensitivity that are present in this film.

TV.Zach (Trevor Wright) is a 22 year old who is aimlessly spending his life in the working class town of San Pedro, just inland from the fancy homes of Laguna Beach.  Besides his dead-end job as a short order cook, Zach helps to take care of his disabled, widowed father, as well as his young nephew Cody, whose single, alcoholic mother also lives with them. Zach is also an avid surfer and skateboarder, but his real passion and talent is as a art, specializing in ""tagging"" walls of buildings with his creative designs.  When his best friend, Gabe, away at college, Zach assumes he'll be going surfing alone, until Gabe's older brother, Shaun (Brad Rowe, who most gay fans will remember from ""Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss""), arrives in town to stay for a while.  The two develop a friendship ... and more, as repressed gay leanings surface once he gets to know the openly-gay Gabe.  Zach initially fights his feelings, tries to reconcile with his girlfriend, and fears the ridicule of his buddies and sister if they found out.  His sister already made it clear that she doesn't want Cody being around ""that (derrogative term for homosexual)"", and Zach worries what could happen to Cody if he is not around to help with his care.A realistically-portrayed coming-of-age/coming out masterpiece of a film, beautifully photographed and above-average acting, music and direction. A sweet, almost lyrical story with a positive message, showing that ""love"" transcends anyone's definition of a ""family,"" to include supportive friends who help you realize your ultimate happiness in life.DVD includes director/actor commentary track, ""making of"" featurette and trailer.

1141114,A1GB0HW46Y2EB,B0013D8LCW,Bruce G. Taylor,"[2, 2]","While watching ""Shelter,"" a rather sweet-natured story about a good-hearted, self-sacrificing young man dealing with the realization that he might be gay, I was reminded of the the Otto Preminger film of 1962, ""Advise and Consent.""  In it a young but influential senator, now happily married  and with a small child, had had sexual relations with a man while in military service who, now in poverty, is attempting to contact the senator for money and threatening to expose his past. The senator becomes so distraught with the situation before him that he commits suicide rather than suffer exposure, an effective if extreme solution to his problems.  CAUTION -- the next paragraphs contains spoilers to the plot of ""Shelter.""This film makes one realize the distance we have (hopefully) traversed in 50 or so years.  In ""Shelter"" an artistically gifted young man, Zach, played by Trevor Wright, is helping to support his sister and her little boy, Cody (Jackson Wurth), and their ailing father, and, as a result, has given up his hopes of attending an art academy.  Zach's boyhood friend, Gabe (Ross Thomas), who is straight, has an older brother, Shaun, (Brad Rowe), who had taught them both to surf a few years before and is known by his brother, Gabe, to be gay.  Shaun, who has returned to the area and is living at the family residence in a much nicer part of town,  reestablishes an acquaintance with Zach and a friendship begins to develop  between them.  As time goes on this becomes more than a friendship as Zach comes to terms with his sexual feelings and gradually falls in love with Shaun.  Zach's sister, Jeanne (Tina Holmes), is planning to leave the area with her dolt of a male friend and intends to leave her child in Zach's care for a considerable period.  Zach's relationship with Shaun becomes known to her and she initially doesn't want her child anywhere near Shaun, but gradually comes to realize that Cody, who is very attached to Zach and now to Shaun as well, would be better off under his and Shaun's care than with her and her male friend who isn't particularly fond of Cody.  The film ends with Zach, now having broken up with his girlfriend, Tori (Katie Walder), and his little nephew now living happily with Shaun who has seen to it that Zach will get to attend art school after all.  The film was skillfully written and directed by Jonah Markowitz.  The brief final scene of Zach, Cody and Shaun happily romping on the beach was apparently added some months after the film had been considered complete as both Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe are here seen having long hair.The cast is generally excellent and the developing relationship portrayed between Zach and Shaun, a bit rocky at times due to Zach's uncertainty and hesitancy, being all the more captivating for that reason.  This is a dramatically and visually pleasing, well-made if rather short film about a character portrayed as being gay who does not necessarily end up as a victim of a mental breakdown, suicide or murder.  There are several scenes in this movie that are quite effecting, most notably the two scenes in which his two straight friends -- his ex-girlfriend, Tori, and his boyhood surfing buddy, Gabe  -- each in their way help put Zach back on the right track toward his relationship with Shaun, his obvious true love.Zach is, of course, the central character of the story and all of the other characters are defined by their relationships to him. There is essentially no scene in the film in which Zach doesn't appear and the title could easily have been ""Zach's Story.""  How the title of ""Shelter"" was chosen isn't exactly clear to me.  Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe, both straight actors, bring a degree of warmth and believability to their characters that is quite amazing.Incidentally, in the commentary track, director Jonah Markowitz erroneously refers to the suspension bridge in San Pedro, shown several times in the film, as the Saint Thomas Bridge.  The correct name is the Vincent Thomas bridge.UPDATE -- 7-11-14:  Well, I held off for as long as I could and finally gave in and bought into the imported region-free Blu-ray of ""Shelter.""  I  had some trepidation.  ""Shelter"" was originally shot as a 16 mm negative, blown up to a 35 mm print, so I expected the possibility of seeing little improvement with Blu-ray.  Not so at all!  The improvement in detail and contrast is apparent from the first frame.  The sound is DTS optional for 5.1 and 2.0 stereo and is an improvement over the DVD version in that respect as well.  And there was no compatibility problem.  Only disappointment -- it doesn't include the commentary track available on the original.  But I have the DVD version tucked into the same case with the Blu-ray, so no big deal.

1141115,A31RY1WMDBPAYT,B0013D8LCW,calvinyw,"[5, 6]","I am gay, but I dislike most of the gay movies out there. There are only a few exception: Brokeback Mountain, Borstal Boys and Beautiful Thing. All other gay movies are always victims to one of the followings: being too sensitive, or too chatty, or too corny. This is certainly an exception: no drag queens, no drugs, no gay bars, no AIDS victim, no party boys. And it's thoroughly refreshing.Enough good thing have been said about this movie, which is now in my very short list of favorite gay movies. A lot of reviews give credit to Trevor Wright for his excellent performance. Credit well deserved. However, I think director Jonah Markowitz deserve the most credit for putting together a movie in which everything feels so natural and real.The best part of this movie is the dialogue: It's short, precise and yet powerful. For example: the dialogue on the patio after their dinner:Shawn: ""I admire what you are doing for Cody. You don't have to.""Zach: ""Yes. I do.""Shawn: ""It's a choice, Zach.""Zach: ""It's family.""Zach: ""The only one left.""Shawn: ""You get that from your mom.""Zach: ""Yeah, I know.""Zach: ""Lucky me.""This is a simply love story. Even though the word ""Love"" was never said in the movie, there was never one moment of doubt how much they were in love. There are lots of little things in the movie that you will recognize if you were ever in love. When Zach was driving away after his first night with Shawn, a little smile slowly crept up his face, and he just couldn't hold it anymore, and scratched his head for getting a little embarassed on the silly happiness.Shane Mack also deserves high praises for the songs he wrote for this movie. When Zach couldn't fall asleep, flipping back and forth, the images of him with Shawn were flashing through his head. The moment wouldn't have such an emotional impact without Shane Mack's ""More Than This"" playing in the background.The negatives I can think of is that for someone who's never been with a guy, Zach was quite adept in stripping off Shawn's cloths that night. Also, Gabe would have seen Zach's truck outside when he barged in, and he's not the kind of person who wouldn't say anything about it. Sorry, I know I am nitpicking. But if you are like me watching this movie 10 times in the first week, you would be too. :-)I do have one issue with the cover of the DVD. If I hadn't read its review first to know what the movie is about, I would have easily dismissed it as another soft-core gay porn that's dressed up as a movie. There could be a hundred moments in the movie that would be a better cover than this bed shot. I have to believe that it wasn't picked by the director who has handled everything so tastefully without losing the erotic force. Thanks to AfterElton.com that listed it as the #3 of all time greatest gay movies, I didn't miss now-my-favorite gay movie that's not a tragedy (BBM and Borstal Boys) or a fairy tale (Beautiful Thing).In my opinion, David Wiegand from SF Chronicle has the best review on this movie: ""Sometimes a film that otherwise relies on stock storylines and even skirts the fringes of old-fashioned melodrama can rise up on the strength of other elements. In the case of writer/director Jonah Markowitz's feature film debut, ""Shelter"" rises very high indeed, thanks to a superb performance by Trevor Wright in the lead role, a strong supporting cast, very good cinematography and, most of all, emotional authenticity.""",5,An Old Story that Rises Up on Emotional Authenticity,1221264000,"09 13, 2008",2008,3428,"['am', 'gay', 'dislike', 'most', 'gay', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'exception', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Borstal', 'Boys', 'Beautiful', 'Thing', 'other', 'gay', 'movies', 'are', 'always', 'victims', 'one', 'followings', 'being', 'too', 'sensitive', 'too', 'chatty', 'too', 'corny', 'certainly', 'exception', 'drag', 'drugs', 'gay', 'bars', 'AIDS', 'victim', 'party', 'boys', 'thoroughly', 'refreshing.Enough', 'good', 'thing', 'have', 'been', 'said', 'movie', 'now', 'very', 'short', 'list', 'favorite', 'gay', 'movies', 'lot', 'reviews', 'give', 'credit', 'Trevor', 'Wright', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Credit', 'well', 'deserved', 'However', 'think', 'director', 'Jonah', 'Markowitz', 'deserve', 'most', 'credit', 'putting', 'together', 'movie', 'everything', 'feels', 'so', 'natural', 'real.The', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'short', 'precise', 'yet', 'powerful', 'example', 'dialogue', 'patio', 'dinner', 'Shawn', 'admire', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'Cody', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Zach', 'Yes', 'do', 'Shawn', 'choice', 'Zach', 'Zach', 'family', 'Zach', 'only', 'one', 'left', 'Shawn', 'get', 'mom', 'Zach', 'Yeah', 'know', 'Zach', 'Lucky', 'simply', 'love', 'story', 'Even', 'word', 'Love', 'was', 'never', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'never', 'one', 'moment', 'doubt', 'how', 'much', 'were', 'love', 'are', 'lots', 'little', 'things', 'movie', 'will', 'recognize', 'were', 'ever', 'love', 'When', 'Zach', 'was', 'driving', 'away', 'first', 'night', 'Shawn', 'little', 'smile', 'slowly', 'crept', 'up', 'face', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'hold', 'anymore', 'scratched', 'head', 'getting', 'little', 'embarassed', 'silly', 'happiness.Shane', 'Mack', 'also', 'high', 'praises', 'songs', 'wrote', 'movie', 'When', 'Zach', 'could', ""n't"", 'fall', 'asleep', 'flipping', 'back', 'forth', 'images', 'Shawn', 'were', 'flashing', 'head', 'moment', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'such', 'emotional', 'impact', 'Shane', 'Mack', 'More', 'Than', 'playing', 'background.The', 'negatives', 'can', 'think', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'guy', 'Zach', 'was', 'quite', 'adept', 'stripping', 'off', 'Shawn', 'cloths', 'night', 'Also', 'Gabe', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'Zach', 'truck', 'when', 'barged', 'not', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'Sorry', 'know', 'am', 'nitpicking', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', '10', 'times', 'first', 'week', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'do', 'have', 'one', 'issue', 'cover', 'DVD', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'review', 'first', 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'easily', 'dismissed', 'soft-core', 'gay', 'porn', 'dressed', 'up', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'hundred', 'moments', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'cover', 'bed', 'shot', 'have', 'believe', 'was', ""n't"", 'picked', 'director', 'who', 'handled', 'everything', 'so', 'tastefully', 'losing', 'erotic', 'force', 'Thanks', 'AfterElton.com', 'listed', '3', 'time', 'greatest', 'gay', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'now-my-favorite', 'gay', 'movie', 'not', 'tragedy', 'BBM', 'Borstal', 'Boys', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Beautiful', 'Thing', '.In', 'opinion', 'David', 'Wiegand', 'SF', 'Chronicle', 'best', 'review', 'movie', 'Sometimes', 'film', 'otherwise', 'stock', 'storylines', 'even', 'fringes', 'old-fashioned', 'melodrama', 'can', 'rise', 'up', 'strength', 'other', 'elements', 'case', 'writer/director', 'Jonah', 'Markowitz', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'Shelter', 'very', 'high', 'indeed', 'thanks', 'superb', 'performance', 'Trevor', 'Wright', 'lead', 'role', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'cinematography', 'most', 'emotional', 'authenticity']",Shelter

My personal opinion is that the bar for gay cinema has been so lowered that this passes for greatness; it really doesn't.It's true that the film doesn't indulge in gay stereotypes:  that is, there's no campy/effete/flamboyant character to epitomize what it ""is"" to be a gay man.  The gay men in this film drink beer, and they surf.But all the other stereotypes are there in spades.  Zach's best friend, another surfer dude, who laments ""Oh, why wouldn't you come out to me?  I'm your best friend!""  (Listen to how he refers to his gay brother and decide whether you want to be defined by your sexuality like that from then on.)  Zach's sister, who naturally doesn't want to raise her child around some ""fag,"" but who changes her mind after one impassioned speech.  And Zach's ex-girlfriend, remarkably tolerant of the fact that the guy she last slept with has moved on to sleep with guys.Zach himself is not a gay stereotype; instead, he is an ""indie movie"" stereotype.  The troubled kid with a heart of gold who loves his family and his nephew sooooo much that he refuses to ever call his sister (mother of the nephew) out on how poorly she's raising the kid.  In almost every scene she's in, Zach's sister is busing imposing upon him to take care of Zach while she goes off galavanting with her new boyfriend who, oddly, doesn't like her kid.  The exceptions are one scene when she's loudly making out with the new boyfriend while her son is asleep, and when she's imposing on Zach to take the kid for six months to a year while she moves to another city with the boyfriend.  (For some reason, the ENTIRE CITY PROHIBITS THE INTRODUCTION OF CHILDREN INTO ITS BORDERS.)  Zach never once complains, but instead sucks it all up, giving up portions of his social life and definitely giving up his dream of going to art school on a full scholarship.Indie movie film vibe, I get it.

It has a story that is unique and poignant, great writing, and some great acting.What it's missing is the sexual tension.  I don't see those looks of lust between Zack and Sean.  When they're not in bed together, they act as if they're two straight guys hanging out.  Yes, it's clear that they learn to deeply care for each other and be vulnerable - but that's not lust.  Every moment leading up to the make-out session is without sexual tension.  No lingering looks or ever so slightly too long touches.  Not that we need that to be over-the-top, but we something - anything!  People that are about to hook-up need to look to each other as if they're wanting each other -- which they don't.  Frankly, it just seems under-rehearsed.Brad Rowe and Trevor Wright never seem to take on their characters as whole different people than who they, themselves as the actors, are.  The way they walked, moved, spoke -- it just didn't seem that there was any stretching or altering of themselves to play these characters.  They never change their own individual vocal patterns or posture to become different characters.  We've all seen many straight men play gay characters.  But this was the first time I was really just not buying it. I didn't believe either of them were gay.  I understand and appreciate not wanting to ""act gay,"" but all gay men have this look about them that says they've been through repression and hard-times.  They just didn't.  It's hard to explain - but it wasn't there. This resulted in the sex scenes' passion to be mediocre -- hot, but mediocre.In addition, I got a distinct feeling that the Zack/Sean relationship needed to be explored and analyzed more by these actors.  I saw an interview where Rowe said that he got the script three days before filming.  It shows.Sadly, it's the film's star, Trevor Wright, who never really rises to the occasion in his acting.  He never seems to truly makes Markowitz's lines his own for most of the movie.  He never fleshes-out a character that would really speak these lines.  All his subtexts and actions seemed very directed and mannered.  It was clear that he did a lot of work as an actor to understand Zack's story, but rarely did I see the inner torment a gay man who's scared to come-out goes through.  It just wasn't enough to really succeed.Brad Rowe is an incredibly natural actor - making Markowitz's words his own and really come to life.  We grew to like Sean and feel he was a real person.Tina Holmes was the stand-out actor of this film.  She embodied Jeannie, made her relatable, and earned our understanding and sympathy.  We can tell she understood and empathized with the character's situation.  She's a great actress and did a phenomenal job.In the end, it's because the film is so touching that makes the audience root for it.  It touches any romantic's heart.

1141129,A3JYAX8BP7W3D2,B0013D8LCW,Drew Odom,"[235, 250]","""Pure being,"" a friend of mine once said enviously of the surfers riding the waves along the Southern California coast some thirty years ago.  Though there was a strict demarcation between the gay section of the beaches and those parts that belonged to the surfers alone, even then a few surfers hung out at night in the Breakers or one of the other gay bars along Highway One, especially in Laguna. There, what seemed so easy a life out in the Pacific, just following the next big waves one after another, became less obvious and more conflicted.  Stories about coming out have so dominated many gay films that the theme has developed into an archetype, a genre of its own with endless variations:  from dark into light, from secrets into revelation.  In Shelter, Zach is a young artist who has turned down a scholarship at CalArts in order to stay home to care for his nephew Cody.  Zach has inherited the family gene, from his mother he says.  All the concerns and nearly all the love the five year old Cody should find in his mother, Zach's sister Jeanne, he gets from Zach alone.  Zach has had a long time girlfriend, but everything about their relationship is tentative, on hold.  When he meets his best friend's older brother again after several years, they surf together, just as they used to.  But Shaun is an openly gay man who has published a novel which Zach has read.  Shaun's sexuality is no secret to Zach, but Zach's is to Shaun--as it may still be to Zach himself, at least in the sense that he has never before been with a man (or in all likelihood a woman; his responses to his girlfriend are mostly tepid, except when his real longings frighten him).  What Zach wants more than anything are family and love.  After a night during which he and Shaun kiss, Zach is happy but its meaning is still uncertain.  He rides the waves, paces the deck of the house he shares with his sister and nephew in what he calls San Pedro's ghetto, then drives back to the family house on the beach where Shaun is staying to recuperate emotionally after a boyfriend has dumped him in L.A.  What follows between Zach and Shaun is stunning in its impact upon both men.  Their coupling, however, is not filmed as soft core porn, all or nearly all about the physical alone, but as love scenes.  What matters most is the feeling shown through their eyes.  All the acting in this emotionally profound film is superb, but the love beyond words Zach and Shaun manage to express just with their eyes has almost never before been seen in movies, not even, say, in Brokeback where to some degree it was often having to be hidden by one or the other man.  What follows in Shelter is Zach's coming to understand what that love means to him for the rest of his life.  Part of this is the usual problem of coming out to his friends and to his sister, though nearly all that effort is accomplished for him; they know before he tells them. But he must also come to see himself better; he must change, too, as he tells Shaun later.  Part of that transformation is his discovering more fully who Shaun is.  Shaun has been criticized by some viewers for being too patient with Zach.  But patience is part of love, one of the virtues that help people abide all the messes we make or almost make out of our lives.  When Zach learns that Shaun has mailed his application and portfolio to CalArts, he sees, quietly, the man's generosity.  In a way, Shaun has shown that he loves Zach as kindly and patiently as Zach loves Cody.  Zach's and Shaun's erotic communion is intense.  But this is a love that is also caritas, deep, perhaps abiding.  It is his recognition of that possibiity, if not certainty that leads Zach back to Shaun, especially after a talk with his girlfriend in which he says his only regret (about being gay) is that he wanted to make a family with her.  In this moment between them, it is her goodness which allows her to encourage Zach to return to Shaun, to the different family he might find now through Shaun and with Cody.  At least, she says, he should try.  Near the end, after Zach and Shaun drive to the house to pick up Cody from Zach's sister who is moving to Portland with her rough boyfriend, Zach turns to Shaun and takes his hand in his.  It is a gesture of love between them as telling as any more passionate embrace.  The seemingly unencumbered lives both men had known together surfing when younger--Shaun the master, Zach the pupil in a running joke between them--has grown into a love that is in every sense good.  I think this is one of the best movies ever made about gay men, searchingly decent and generously spirited about love without any loss in erotic force.  It is also wonderfully realized, except in a few of the songs on the soundtrack, in both the director's eye and the hearts of all the performers, even those in relatively minor roles (Gabe is as perfect a surfer dude as one can imagine, but with more than the usual soul).  But Trevor Wright as Zach gives to his character an especially touching complexity.  Zach is in some ways still a kid, talking in the lingo of surfers, tagging buildings, riding his skateboard.  But he's also emotionally older than everyone else in his life, already committed to a way of living many people never come to.  His coming out is more painful to himself than it is to others perhaps because his need for real communion is already so great. Yet he finds it.  This is emotionally complex work for so young an actor.  But every gesture he makes, everything he expresses is true; no moment ever feels false or contrived.  What the movie leaves one with is a sense of both the hopes and ambiguities of moral being, a far more difficult, yet greater life than merely riding the waves of one's youth.",5,A Generously Spirited

Gentile,"[9, 10]","Sometimes, rarely, after having watched dozens upon dozens of disappointing films, you get lucky and come across one that not only lives up to, but surpasses all the praise that more often than not was just hype anyways. And... also sometimes, you go back to watch it a second time just to see if your first impression was correct, and you are horrified to see that you were mistaken and that this is just a lousy film and you don't know what you were thinking. Have I sufficiently confused you? Then let me just say that this film, ""Shelter"", was one of the most beautiful, surprising, well acted, noble films I've ever seen. These actors, most of whom are either unknown or not ""stars"", are so, so much better than the small but undying, rotating, irritating crop of so called superstars that monopolize every churned out piece of Hollywood garbage. The performances here are so seamless, modest, and real, that you feel that you are watching just that, real life. Of course, watching real life can be boring, and what most actors and films of today completely fail at is to not only make the story interesting, but enables it to go beyond being entertainment to give it that intangible element of realism that  truly moves you. In this film you feel their pain, joy, loneliness, frustration,  and liberation in your very gut, and that is rare for  films today, especially a ""small' film that does not bang you over the head with special effects or try and bring a tear to your eye with overacting and ear splitting sweeping music.  Though this film has a gay story line, it is relevant to anyone who is alive, and it's message about love, loyalty, and being true to yourself is for everyone. I will not go on and i will not tell you the story line as plenty of other reviewers have already done this, and some of them very well.  I will only say that as a person who grew up loving the movies and having been disappointed in 95% of all the films made in the last 25 years, it is so refreshing, enjoyable, and heartening to come across a film as beautiful as this one. It is poetry. It is perfect. It hopefully makes some people aware that there are different and positive qualities that define a ""family."" It is the best film of it's kind that I have ever seen.

He struggles with relationships, challenged by his desire for honesty and his fear of the consequences that truth will bring.  And through it all we see him growing, in realistic ways.I do think the movie fails in any type of exploration of the meaning of relationships between younger and older men (if early 30's can qualify as older).  I never did quite figure out the time span covered in the film, but decided I'd like the film best if it is months rather than weeks.The surfing and waves make great symbols of change, control, collapse.  The always sunny Southern California setting adds a quality of its own, whether at the multi-million dollar house or the places next to the refineries.The most effective mesage taken away from the movie is how true love, if between lovers, friends, family is inclusive.  It is neediness that blocks those not seen as the fount of that satisfaction.All a little esoteric.  This movie is a pleasure to watch.  The extras, particularly the ""making of"", add a lot of value.  Though, I gotta say, I still get bummed out when straight actors, even the gorgeous ones, get to play the solid gay characters.  Yeah, I know.  I want the gay actors to be able to play straight characters, and I should be consistant.

1141153,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B0013D8LCW,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[65, 77]",".........Some ""Childhood Fantasies"" can come true ) (alternate review title).  Oh, and.....how about even a 2d alternate title:  ""Who do YOU think was holding that Video Recorder?""((Here is my approach to obtaining/viewing/reviewing Gay tales in film form (you could see it as seeking the holy grail of that genre, or as looking for the ""Addictive Film""---that movie one returns to time and again). Selection and purchase of a film to view is based mainly on finding new releases by favorite directors/screenwriters and/or on comments/reviews by others of you at major online sites. Re the latter, sometimes I feel correctly steered by you (the ""Keepers"" filling my DVD shelves), other times mislead, occasionally badly (the ""Throwaways""----and I do toss 'em). Rarely, I come across the ""Addictive,"" those I can re-watch at least every couple of months or so (see below starred *** area for a list......and for some of the ""near-Addictive"" as well). For some movies, I'll share a full review with you, as follows for this film. Thanks for sticking with me so far.))As a preface to all this, I'm not interested in telling the story here; I'm into telling 'about' the story here. And that's easy because the gay relationship part of it is one of the best on film and DVD today.First off, it's got to be said that, whether one's straight or gay (except for those already ""out""), putting yourself ""out there"" for this type role has got to be an extremely difficult decision. Why? Because people in our backward and selectively puritanical society are going to make assumptions about you for doing so---whether they be correct or incorrect. Bearing this in mind, Director Markowitz was surprisingly fortunate in obtaining the acting services of both a Trevor Wright and a Brad Rowe. And whether taking these roles was good for their careers, both actors absolutely shine in this production.......as used to be said: these guys got Chemistry. There's a naturalness, a comfortableness between the two that's seldom been achieved in other gay romances set to film.Also, big kudos to this director for being able to elicit/draw out such intimately physical scenes between our two leads. Kissing, especially, comes across as unforced, unrushed (except when they're ""hot"") and completely enjoyed by the characters (even if and when ""tongue"" might be involved). I'd call this kind of ""acting"" going above and beyond. Would that every American, gay romance director achieve this same degree of natural intimacy on the part of male couples; very few have. In my opinion, only French director, Christian Faure, in his 2000 French production, ""Just A Question Of Love"" (Just a Question of Love) (or ""Juste Une Question D'Amour"" when looking it up on some other film websites), set the bar higher. Intimacy between the two in that film fairly crackles.As for their individual performances:-- Trevor Wright puts Zach across as the ultimate likable guy---one putting everyone else's needs before his own (whether they deserve it or not). He's the one often being put upon, yet he stays so positive.......no wonder that Shaun falls for him. He makes us all fall for him. And nowhere do we do so more than when, at the end of his most intimate scene, he and Shaun are lying happily face to face, and Trevor has brought Zach's expression to such a peacefully satisfied level that Shaun just has to say: ""You're so beautiful"" (and at that moment we can see he truly is). Then, our Zach can only shyly bring himself to wrinkle his nose and softly scoff: ""Shut up."" What an endearing moment.-- Re Brad Rowe: In preparing for this shoot and the extreme intimacy of some of the scenes, someone had to lead the way. I more than suspect that person was the older and much more film-experienced 'The Brad-ster.' This becomes apparent when you listen to the DVD Special Features Voice-over Commentary by Markowitz, Brad and Trevor, and conclude that Brad's comfortably easy and low key approach was just what was needed to pull character Zach (as well as newer performer, Trevor) out of any shell of fears and doubts he might be having. In the end, it is through Brad's Shaun that we see Zach being so very fortunate to have wound up with a loving/caring person who would remove him from the undesirable circumstances in which he lived.......and, importantly, get him into the advanced art schooling he so definitely deserved.As concerns their ""time-together"" scenes and performances, it becomes obvious from listening to specific comments by Trevor and Brad in the Voice-over that they are quite proud of their work in the love-making scenes, particularly the really intimate moments. How often could we expect to hear non-gay actors express such thoughts---knowing everyone watching the video would hear them? Not often, I suspect.And let's not forget about Director, Jonah Markowitz. It's obvious from watching this, his first-time feature film, that he has the chops to run with the big boys. Why? Because for any film to be successful, it is the ""little touches"" a director/scriptwriter worth his salt throws in that mean the difference in a memorable production and one that isn't. Take the exciting scene we all love where Zach returns to Shaun's house and, for all practical purposes, throws himself into Shaun's arms (and bed). Markowitz doesn't just shoot this happening; instead he gives us a very emotional lead-up scene of an agonizing Zach, pacing around his little art workspace and nervously knocking things about. Now, finally, he's fully admitted to himself who he is, sexually, and what kind of relationship he wants with the one who means the most to him. At this point, he's got our sympathies and has us worked up almost as much as himself......just waiting for that next step to be taken. It's then, in the very next scene, that we see Shaun heading for his front door and the person we know is anxiously waiting there. What happens next is: Wow!!  So you see, folks, this is how a really successful director does things.Moving on to other considerations, not everything about the film works out so well for this reviewer. While Tina Holmes does a fine job with her role as Zach's sister, Jeanne, it is not her fault that her called-for and frequently whinny/naggy, oh-poor-me, onscreen time exceeds what otherwise would have made for a better film. We'd already quickly learned that it is Zach who is the real put upon one, whose life is being stolen. Better, by far, would have been less scenes involving her and more of involving Zach/Shaun's developing relationship.And what's my favorite scene? Well I have to say that, other than those arousing ""BGLM"" shots (Dudes, ya just gotta learn what that means by taking in the DVD Voice-over feature), my fave is definitely that quiet, easy surfside stroll taken by Zach and Shaun, their arms comfortably bumping from time to time. They begin talking of writer Shaun's last book, a gay romance novel. And then, because of Zach's glowing remarks about having read the book, it starts becoming clear to us that it's becoming clear to Shaun that Zach clearly knows about and is comfortable with Shaun's, shall we say, big sexual proclivity in life. Then, it's, like, WHOA!!!......as it suddenly hits Shaun what just might lie ahead for the two of them. It's a perfect little scene.A final thought involving an appropriate 'mantra' for this film.......which would be: {""Little by little, the 'Master' leads the 'Student' out---capitalize those 3 letters if you will---so he can be who he really is, and comfortably so""}.  That's really the journey on which this movie has taken us. (If you actually watch this film, the terms just now used will have so much more meaning).P.S.---And, importantly, at the very end we've learned that, like fairytales, some ""Childhood Fantasies"" can also come true (here,again, if you listened well during the screening, you'll know what this means).P.P.S.---If you've been wonder'n about this review's title), then all ya have to do to satisfy that itch is to grab a look and listen to the DVD Special Features section, wherein the Director + Brad + Trevor walk us through that 'first kiss' scene. Very enlightening.P.P.P.S.---As to who was holding that Video Recorder (you know, the one that shot a little video titled:  ""SKATE THIS! with GABE & ZACH,"" showing a couple of early teenage skateboarders doin their thing) the answer would likely be a younger Shaun.  Then, it hits us:  isn't it interesting that an emotionally down and vulnerable Shaun---on the downspin from a difficult relationship breakup---finds his way back to that place of pleasanter times, that place of fonder connections, that place of.......Zach.  (We've already pretty much arrived at the conclusion that he hadn't come home to see his away-from-the-area parents, or a brother he'd been seeing from time to time, anyway).***This film is becoming

It's incredibly refreshing to find a movie that doesn't pander to traditional gay male stereotypes. There have been a lot of things said here about this movie already, some incredibly insightful. Rather than try to struggle for the usual explicatives, I'll just say how & why this movie moved and touched my soul.There were a lot of plots and subplots going on here; poverty, desperate lives being crushed and yet there was always the glimmer of hope on the horizon, art, angst of coming out and the poignancy of first time/unconditional love. And of course, how utterly exquisite to truly portray how much a sport can mean to a male and how it can anchor us even in the craziest of times. Although my life has been somewhat different, I can relate to so many levels and pieces of this movie that it's scary and uncanny at the same time. All of it...to come out as an adult when formally you've been in hiding with all your friends, to catch that one last run of the day as you chase the sun...to have the freedom (for the first time) to really love somebody of the same sex that you were always meant to love in the first place. I lived this movie through both the main characters because I've been both the main characters as I lived through poverty with hopeless, broken dreams and a unwavering loyalty to 'family', while discovering true love in the midst of chaos and ashes.And through it all, Zack's mural was his life; his frustration, his intense sadness, his trap, his love of family, the angst of being misunderstood by everyone and finally the sublime happiness of new-found love. It's all there, the life of a man painted on a wall for the world to witness and see.This isn't a perfect movie by any means; the 'sex scene' was stilted and phony, yet the tender kissing scenes where as good as they can get. Truly, both the main actors are gifted to pull off such a believable gay love story.  But this is a movie that you have to take in it's entirety and not something subject to be picked apart scene by scene. There were times when I shouted at the screen and times when I teared up. The relationship with Shaun and Zack's little brother (Cody) was magnificently portrayed. It's not publicized enough how fluid and positive gay men can be around impressionable boys.  The homophobic ignorance portrayed is painfully accurate in this movie; with respect to how many parents/adults think that young boys hanging around with a gay role model is 'just not right'.I've probably seen 150+ gay themed movies in the last three yrs and this one is absolutely in the top tier of my mental queue list.

Perhaps it is profound that the gay characters in this movie, are 'normal' in that they are love struck, confused, and yet function as every other person in society. They are not dying of Aids, nor are they subject to the frivolity of stereotypical gay casting. There is no neurosis, but rather an honest exploration of emotions.

While staying at a friend's house over the Thanksgiving holiday, serendipity intervened and allowed me to catch this sublimely acted and beautifully nuanced piece.  I don't think I'll ever be the same.To me, what often separates the good from the great when it comes to film is that good movies manage to come up with something new while great movies are able to make standard material, even the highly cliched (boy meets boy/girl), seem completely original, authentic, and fresh. Shelter definitely falls under the latter description. What is miraculous is that it went a step further by having the narrative, music, and visuals completely wash over the viewer - like surfing a giant wave. The result is a sense that the film is an intimate chronicle of one's own journey for affirmation and acceptance, even if the details of one's life are completely different.Just in time for the holidays, this DVD definitely tops my Christmas Wish List but in more ways than one: The soundtrack is beyond amazing and I hope to own that soon. Although I typically avoid movies that are made out of books, I would love to see the reverse take place and have a book made out of this movie. (It could be fictitiously penned by and written from the perspective of the character of Shaun, since he was a writer.) I also hope to see a sequel or a TV series even.

Zack fulfills the parental role for Cody, although at times grudgingly, as he gives up hope for a better future on the other side of the tracks and resigns himself to a life of flipping burgers.Suddenly Zack cannot suppress his feelings for Shaun, but nobody is really thrilled with the revelation that Zack might be gay.  Zack must decide between his own needs and dreams (whatever he decides they are) and the needs and requirements of his family.Brad Rowe, last seen inBilly's Hollywood Screen Kissfinds material much more worthy and he rises to the occasion.  Actually, all the acting and production in this film is good and the tone and pace of the film are well-executed and effective.Along with gay and straight parenting/family issues, there is a good examination about the relationship between two men of somewhat differing ages, economic backgrounds, and in different stages of coming out to themselves and their families.This is a great movie overall and a great example of modern gay-themed movies.

The movie is about the love that develops between two surfers Shaun (Brad Rowe) and Zack (Trevor Wright.) Zack comes from a dysfunctional family with a sister who is a single mother and her son Cody. Zack pretty much plays a father role to Cody and babysits him a lot. Shaun comes from a rich family who has a house by the beach. They both grew up together but Shaun being older than Zack. Shaun's brother is Zack's buddy.Zack discovers he is gay after one night of drinking with Shaun. Shaun has just returned from LA who just broke with someone and was waiting to get a new place. Shaun kisses Zack and the turmoil begins.Jeannie, Zack's sister, decides to move to Oregon with her new boyfriend. She dumps Cody on Zack. Zack finally comes to grips with his sexuality and decides to become a family with Shaun who adopts Zack and Cody.Zack is a very talented artist who gets accepted to an Art College with a full scholarship. Shaun is a writer for Hollywood. And Jeannie abandons her son.That is the movie in a shell. I like how Zack is portrayed as a caring, selfless, loving young man.

The love story is sweet and simple and unexpected--finding love with your best friend's brother.But what I find most exceptional about this film is a basic underlying theme that sometimes gay people are the ones with the common sense.  Obviously, in Zach's family, only Zach and Cody have any common sense.  Zach feels an extreme sense of obligation to Cody while it is painfully obvious that Cody's mother is lacking in maternal instinct.I think at first many will find Jeanne, Cody's mother, to be a somewhat shocking character in her nearly total disregard for her son's well being.  Sadly, it is all too common.In the end, Shelter is a beautiful love story where pure and simple love is found among a sad and complicated situation and it is pure magic that a family is born out of all the turmoil.There are moments of absolute magic in this film...scenes that should melt your heart...and yet they are actually quite simple.  When Shaun is looking at Zach's book of drawings and expresses the fact that he ""get's it"" and understands the meaning in the drawings and Zach just looks at Shaun in stunned silence.  The other scene is where Shaun tries to convince Zach to come over for steaks and tells Zach to bring Cody along.

It's about Zach (Trevor Wright) who falls in love with Shaun (Brad Rowe). Shaun is the older brother of Gabe (Ross Thomas), Zach's best friend. There's roughly a 12-year difference between Zach and Shaun. Gabe goes off to college in Santa Barbara. While he's gone Zach visits Gabe's house to work on his surf board that he's left in the backyard. Unbeknownst to Zach Shaun is staying there temporarily until the lease on his new place in Los Angeles begins. He surprises Zach. Both are delighted to see each other. It's obvious that Zach has had a crush on Shaun for some time. He invites Shaun to surf with him. Shaun takes up the offer and the romance between them begins.""Shelter"" is a coming of age story in that it's about Zach coming to terms with his sexual orientation. Being older Shaun has already come to terms with his sexuality. He helps Zach to accept who he is. There's much drama in this film as Zach not only comes to terms with his sexuality he has a very trying relationship with his sister, Jeanne (Tina Holmes). She frequently puts Zach in a situation where he has to care for her five-year-old son, Cody (Jackson Wurth). But Zach loves his nephew. He is both uncle and father to him. And Cody worships Zach.Zach and Shaun both love Cody. Shaun's very good with him and loves the funny things he says. Cody tells his Uncle Zach, ""Shaun rocks!""
