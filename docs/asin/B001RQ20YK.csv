It's what leads Nick to the restaurant AND what led me to find these stories after seeingThe Perfect Gift. I was blown away with the first of my experiences and found that it was the latest in the series, preceded with these two productions and a seven part miniseries. This is the Jesus I know. And while not identical to the David Gregory books, the dialog holds very true.You can top it off with a little trivia. Listen for the pilot's voice. The voice is David Gregory. I just sat through the credits and was astonished, but at the same time felt it was ""Perfect."" While the differences are subtle, I do recommend reading the books, Dinner with a Perfect Stranger and A Day With a Perfect Stranger (the two books these productions are based on). You'll want to watch them again and again.",5,Perfect!,1302825600,"04 15, 2011",2011,803,"['Curiosity', 'what', 'Nick', 'restaurant', 'what', 'led', 'find', 'stories', 'seeingThe', 'Perfect', 'Gift', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'first', 'experiences', 'found', 'was', 'latest', 'series', 'preceded', 'two', 'productions', 'seven', 'part', 'miniseries', 'Jesus', 'know', 'not', 'identical', 'David', 'Gregory', 'books', 'dialog', 'very', 'true.You', 'can', 'top', 'off', 'little', 'trivia', 'Listen', 'pilot', 'voice', 'voice', 'David', 'Gregory', 'just', 'sat', 'credits', 'was', 'astonished', 'same', 'time', 'felt', 'was', 'Perfect', 'differences', 'are', 'subtle', 'do', 'recommend', 'reading', 'books', 'Dinner', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'A', 'Day', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'two', 'books', 'productions', 'are', 'based', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'again']",N/A

Both films present the divinity and humanity of Jesus. By Jesus asking questions, explaining issues and telling incidents from each person's life they never told, each realizes who He is.  Throughout, He customizes each encounter to their experiences and needs, conveying love and care.  Both of these touching films lead the way to have meaningful connections with people in showing the love of God.",5,A Perfect Combo,1392940800,"02 21, 2014",2014,652,"['seeing', 'A', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'attorney', 'wife', 'mother', 'having', 'dinner', 'Jesus', 'appreciating', 'what', 'was', 'shared', 'two', 'ordering', 'sequel', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'attorney', 'daughter', 'was', 'natural', 'thing', 'do', 'films', 'present', 'divinity', 'humanity', 'Jesus', 'Jesus', 'asking', 'questions', 'explaining', 'issues', 'telling', 'incidents', 'person', 'life', 'never', 'told', 'realizes', 'who', 'Throughout', 'encounter', 'experiences', 'needs', 'conveying', 'love', 'care', 'touching', 'films', 'lead', 'way', 'have', 'meaningful', 'connections', 'people', 'showing', 'love', 'God']",N/A

They are totally unrelated stories to the Perfect Gift and these two stories are connected to each other.  Very well done, they deal with issues that stand in the way of some having faith in God and deal with those objections one at a time as &#34;Jesus&#34; shows up to answer the doubts of the two women involved... Nikki is  aq troubled attorney in The Perfect Stranger... and ten years later it is her daughter Sarah's turn in Another Perfect Stranger.  There is now a part 3 to this....

Thomas ""specmom""","[0, 0]","If you have ever wondered why God allows pain and suffering as well as answers to many other questions about the Christian faith than this movie set is for you. Even if you are not a believer, you will at least be exposed to enough information in order for you to decide if you want to further look into this faith. The first film is good to show at a Sunday school class but the second one is much better to show at a college youth group or for seniors in high school. It really tackles some issues that are relevant to that age without getting a sermon.
