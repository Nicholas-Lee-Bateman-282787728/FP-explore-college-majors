The story is of a young lad who is evacuated from Amsterdam to a fire-breathing church place-of-safety and is befriended first by a slightly older but physically maturer boy and then by a young Canadian/American soldier who is also lonely and out of place.  Quite how these two identify each other as in need of affection is not revealed.  Nor does the relationship between the two boys get going much apart from them both being thrown together, with the one full of hormones and the other very much a child.  But the young soldier, we are told, falls in love with this young boy, and I don't believe a word of it - the older man speaks no Dutch and the boy has almost no English and their behaviour is little more than that of a mildly misbehaving comradeship, with hints that a sexual act may have taken place - or maybe not - and not a smouldering or lustful and lascivious look between them!  Meanwhile the pastor rants on about sins of the flesh and the young women flirt and maybe do wicked things with other young soldiers that may bring down hellfire and damnation.  There are some symbols thrown in: a crashed plane (with bodies and eels in it), an ID tag, a pair of dark glasses, a scarecrow and a thunderstorm.  And at last Mum comes to fetch the boy home with a ""my, how you've grown"".  And all this is food for a nostalgic dance production celebrating ""freedom"" 25 years later!

The end.I am quite open-minded, but this film was deeply offensive and disturbing.  First of all, twelve year old minor?  Is it not a bit too young?  Second of all, the young adult doesn't seem to even try to conduct any moral calculus of his actions.  Third of all, was it necessary to depict the coitus between the two leads?  Isn't relationship ( rather than gratuitous sex ) in the core of a relationship between an adult and a minor of the same sex?  Because judging from this film, it is not.The film attempts to advance a claim that it is completely &#34;cool&#34; for an adult to engage himself in a sexual activity with an almost prepubescent minor with no deliberation whatsoever as to morality or propriety of doing so under the circumstances.

365417,A1KFWSYZIOBI3Y,6303238734,"DaRRen ""Darren""","[6, 6]","Some reviewers seem to believe that people would only give this film low ratings if they are uncomfortable with the sexual issue. Well, that's preposterous. I had my first crush in kindergarten.  Although it was on another kid, I later had crushes on adults - like most kids. The film actually does a good job portraying kids as sexual beings (which they are). Jan - Jerron's young friend -  loved looking at porn magazines and talking about sex. There was one moment where he tried to stimulate himself while wrestling with Jerron. Kids do these things.The issue of the soldiers and sex is also portrayed. At one point, they bring in women to ""service"" the troops. One girl gets a ""farewell"" gift from a soldier - and I believe she supposedly had a crush on him too. Another young girl appeared in a scene topless and crying; I am assuming she had been assaulted by one of the soldiers. It was war. These things happen. I am not excusing it; I am just saying that anyone with knowledge of human behavior shouldn't be offended by the film.There are some downsides to the film. WE don't get enough info about the soldier. Depending upon his age, this might not have been extremely taboo. Many kids ran off to the war. And without computers, it was not always easy to verify ages. There were a lot of 16 and 17 year olds in WWII. So, it is unclear what the age gap really is. I also wanted to know a little about the soldier's mental state. We know that the young boy is truly in full crush mode. But what does this mean to the soldier? His character is very one dimensional. I blame this on the writing - because the actor was good.I loved how the filmed married past with present (you'll have to watch to know what this means). These were probably the two most creative moments in the movie. Some of that creativity was lost during the middle of the film. I was also bothered that there wasn't enough info at the beginning about the relocation of the children. I figured it out. But I imagine some viewers were lost.Also, the movie spent a lot of time at the beginning building the characters of Jerron and his friend Jan. Suddenly, however, Jan is tossed aside for the soldier. I think they should have spent less time on Jan and more on the soldier. This would have given us more about his background. Instead, he is just a flat fantasy figure. In fact, had the romance been between Jerron and Jan, the movie would have been far more interesting - simply because we know more about Jan.Overall, this is a good film. A lot of kids long for relationships like this with adults. MOST adults stay clear of them. The kids' desire doesn't neutralize the exploitative nature of these relationships. It makes the analysis somewhat more complicated, but it is still exploitative. I would give it a 3.5 - but since I can't - I have rounded up to a four.Finally, I have read so many reviews that argue that this film wouldn't be made by Americans or is supposedly too horrific for American audiences. Please -- give me a break. You must distinguish very expensive Hollywood productions that are designed for general audiences and that are indeed SUCCESSFULLY MARKETED AROUND THE WORLD with smaller independent films -- like this one -- that are viewed by more select audiences. I have seen many independent US films that deal with issues of sexuality. So, let's retire the stereotype.",4,"The Sexual Issue Doesn't Bother Me, But the Film Isn't Perfect",1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,3375,"['reviewers', 'seem', 'believe', 'people', 'would', 'only', 'give', 'film', 'low', 'ratings', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'sexual', 'issue', 'Well', 'preposterous', 'had', 'first', 'crush', 'kindergarten', 'was', 'kid', 'later', 'had', 'crushes', 'adults', 'most', 'kids', 'film', 'actually', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'kids', 'sexual', 'beings', 'are', 'Jan', 'Jerron', 'young', 'friend', 'loved', 'looking', 'porn', 'magazines', 'talking', 'sex', 'was', 'one', 'moment', 'where', 'tried', 'stimulate', 'wrestling', 'Jerron', 'Kids', 'do', 'things.The', 'issue', 'soldiers', 'sex', 'also', 'portrayed', 'one', 'point', 'bring', 'women', 'service', 'troops', 'One', 'girl', 'farewell', 'gift', 'soldier', 'believe', 'supposedly', 'had', 'crush', 'too', 'young', 'girl', 'appeared', 'scene', 'topless', 'crying', 'am', 'assuming', 'had', 'been', 'assaulted', 'one', 'soldiers', 'was', 'war', 'things', 'happen', 'am', 'not', 'excusing', 'am', 'just', 'saying', 'anyone', 'knowledge', 'human', 'behavior', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'offended', 'film.There', 'are', 'downsides', 'film', 'WE', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'info', 'soldier', 'Depending', 'age', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'extremely', 'taboo', 'Many', 'kids', 'ran', 'off', 'war', 'computers', 'was', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'verify', 'ages', 'were', 'lot', '16', '17', 'year', 'olds', 'WWII', 'So', 'unclear', 'what', 'age', 'gap', 'really', 'also', 'wanted', 'know', 'little', 'soldier', 'mental', 'state', 'know', 'young', 'boy', 'truly', 'full', 'crush', 'mode', 'what', 'mean', 'soldier', 'character', 'very', 'one', 'dimensional', 'blame', 'writing', 'actor', 'was', 'good.I', 'loved', 'how', 'filmed', 'married', 'past', 'present', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'probably', 'two', 'most', 'creative', 'moments', 'movie', 'creativity', 'was', 'lost', 'middle', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'bothered', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'info', 'beginning', 'relocation', 'children', 'figured', 'out', 'imagine', 'viewers', 'were', 'lost.Also', 'movie', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'beginning', 'building', 'characters', 'Jerron', 'friend', 'Jan', 'Suddenly', 'however', 'Jan', 'tossed', 'aside', 'soldier', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'spent', 'less', 'time', 'Jan', 'more', 'soldier', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'background', 'Instead', 'just', 'flat', 'fantasy', 'figure', 'fact', 'had', 'romance', 'been', 'Jerron', 'Jan', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'simply', 'know', 'more', 'Jan.Overall', 'good', 'film', 'lot', 'kids', 'long', 'relationships', 'adults', 'MOST', 'adults', 'stay', 'clear', 'kids', 'desire', ""n't"", 'neutralize', 'exploitative', 'nature', 'relationships', 'analysis', 'somewhat', 'more', 'complicated', 'still', 'exploitative', 'would', 'give', '3.5', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'rounded', 'up', 'four.Finally', 'have', 'read', 'so', 'many', 'reviews', 'argue', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'made', 'Americans', 'supposedly', 'too', 'horrific', 'American', 'audiences', 'Please', 'give', 'break', 'must', 'distinguish', 'very', 'expensive', 'Hollywood', 'productions', 'are', 'designed', 'general', 'audiences', 'are', 'indeed', 'SUCCESSFULLY', 'MARKETED', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'smaller', 'independent', 'films', 'one', 'are', 'viewed', 'more', 'select', 'audiences', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'independent', 'US', 'films', 'deal', 'issues', 'sexuality', 'So', 'let', 'retire', 'stereotype']",N/A

That's a wonderful thing about cinema - one can explore ideas which could and should never be explored in reality. The reason I gave the movie 5 is that it indeed made me recall those unforgettable emotions which I felt at the young boy's age - and earlier - and I've not seen another film which has done so, to such an extent. I am reminded that relationships in adulthood would indeed probably benefit rather than suffer if we added to them greater quantities of the elements of the adolescent's concept of love. It is most certainly a film made with all the finesse, beauty and subtlety which one would expect in the finest European cinema.

365422,A1H52G478ZXLFX,6303238734,D. Richardson,"[33, 35]","'For A Lost Soldier' is a film which I have watched several times!  It deals with a volatile topic, the story of a very young boy who fills a gap in his life in the arms of a young Canadian soldier in World War II. Since the story is based on the autobiographical book by Rudi Van Dantzig, it is not whimsy or fiction, but rather a glimpse into one man's pleasant childhood memories.  Rudi Van Dantzig defends the book and the film in the context that he was NOT abused by the soldier! The director took some liberties with the film, both in the introduction and again at the end, but otherwise stayed fairly true to the story. The movie challenges one's ideas regarding consensual sexual relationships which involve an adult and a minor in a specific situation. If anyone was seduced in the film, it was the soldier, according to Van Dantzig.  The boy is in control and very aware of what it is that he wants from the soldier at all times.  The event happened during the liberation of Holland and the liberation theme is tied closely to Van Dantzig's description of his personal liberation.The film also gives a vastly different view of life in Holland under German occupation.  While the movie and book, 'The Hiding Place' portrays the horrors of Nazi power in a large city, this film shows what life was like in a remote village.

I watched this movie for the second time some days ago, and funnily enough, the impact was even bigger than the first time. It keeps playing in my head all day.Some details that had escaped I noticed now. Despite what some people may say, I can't think of something more beautiful and pure than the love the boy obviously felt for his soldier. Reading some reviews, I tend to agree with many of them. They say they got extremely sad. One woman said she felt like tucking the boy in  and telling him his prince would come back. Another guy said he wondered if the soldier really knew how much the kid loved him.Rudi Van Dantzig died in January, this year, and someone said that now he would finally meet his soldier.Touching.They say the book is not as romantic. Well, I couldn't read it, but judging from the movie, it is hard to imagine someone who wouldn't like to live a romance as intense as that, although short, and regardless.The reason for the unfortunate ending will always remain a mystery, and that, in my opinion, adds to the magic.I won't repeat here what has been said about the actors. They are really good. However, one special observation about the boy and the soldier: they are really convincing, and at times you even have the impression that they are actually enjoying it. The boy has the kind of unusual, fleeting beauty that you see once in your life. His eyes look sad, even when he smiles.Of course there will always be those who are ready to criticize it, but that is to be expected. Let's face it: some things are not meant for everybody.Technically speaking, my only gripe is that, unfortunately, the quality of the image is not top, but the movie itself more than compensates for it.

365427,AK7D1BHZOSOL1,6303238734,General Pete,"[0, 0]",This movie probably gets more praise then it deserves because the storyline of a homosexual relationship between a child and an older man just doesn't happen very much.  The film as a story is fine but take a step back and consider something for a second while I will grant you that the Jeroen character is flattered by the attention and the gifts lavished upon him at best the entire relationship between the boy and Walt Cook can be characterized simply as one who is to young to know what is being asked of him and an older man who can't really use the excuse of the devil made me do it.  If their relationship were put in a heterosexual context I think it would be an ill-considered one night stand with the solider slipping out of the window at 5AM with Jeroen left to clean up the mess. From a purely critical point of view in terms of motivation the character of Walt Cook was far more interesting and probably purposely  ambiguous was he genuinely attracted to Jeroen or did he have a young adolescent in every town his unit marched through?  Some have said that this touched on further in the book but I have never read it.When you take out the love story I found the fleeting images that the audience got of rural life in WW2 Europe to be much more fascinating.

365428,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,6303238734,Get What We Give,"[94, 102]","For a Lost Soldier is a quiet little film about subject matter that no American filmmaker would touch with a ten foot pole. It is a touchy matter even by international standards. However, somehow the Dutch are able to address the issue of love between a man and a boy without making it purile and scandalous. Dutch filmmakers seem to be the only ones able to touch such ""iffy"" subject matter and make it far less ""oogy"" than it could be.First of all, this really isn't a movie about sex or sexuality so much as it is a film about love and loss. That is why it works.The time is the early 1940's. The place is Amsterdam and rural areas outside of Amsterdam. The situation is that Amsterdam is suffering from the Nazi occupation and the lack of supplies this has brought about. Residents of Amsterdam are shipping their children off to the country to live and work on farms so that they will have food to eat and a warm bed in which to sleep.This is very frightening stuff if you allow yourself to be transported as one of the children. They've been uprooted and shipped away from home to live with strangers, who may or may not be kind to them. They have fear as a constant companion as they worry about their parents and about the sounds of war in the distance.Our protagonist, Jeroen, is a fresh faced boy of 12 and he has been placed with a family who actually wanted a girl not a boy. While the family is basically kind to him, Jeroen doesn't understand farm life and is slow to adjust. His ""best"" friend is another boy, by a year or two, who has been uprooted and sent to the country as well. The older boy is obviously in the throes of puberty, whereas Jeroen really hasn't hit that point in his physical development. Still prepubescent by a few months or so, Jeroen doesn't understand the lust for the girls and would rather be companions with other boys. He hasn't yet developed that male female connection that the older boys have. He and his friend wander the countryside and discover a plane that has crashed in the water (killing its occupants). This is the first time that Jeroen sees the naked body of a boy/man. This is also a turning point for him. He is made to realize that being naked with another boy is not something normal - ""Don't tell them you saw me naked"" his friend tells him.Later, Canadians arrive on the scene and liberate the residents of the countryside town. They are all ecstatic and grateful for the newfound freedom. The young women and the expatriated Amsterdam girls quickly flirt with the young soldiers. This provides them with chocolates and coca colas as well as sexual perks for the soldiers.This also brings about the films' greatest flaw. As viewers, we can comprehend where the filmmakers are going with the subject matter. However, on screen the transition from acquantaince to lover between Jeroen and one of the soldiers isn't as straightforward as one would expect. Undoubtedly, even the Dutch will allow only so much to be revealed of such touchy subject matter.Jeroen and one of the soldiers, Walt, strike up a hesitant friendship. It is quite plain that Walt is flirting with the boy, but what is also quite plain is that not only is Jeroen flirting, knowingly right back, but that he seems to be taking the lead in relationship developing beyond just simple platonic relations.Walt is identified as gay by a couple of statements he makes. ""I thought right from the start that you were my kind of boy, Jeroen."" That is actually rather creepy, since it means that Walt is truly a pedophile. However, Jeroen knows what Walt means. He's come to realize (and so have we) that Jeroen is gay as well. He may not have ever been with another boy before, but he knows who and what he is.When the sexual aspect of the relationship is actually consummated, it is handled so subtly that you might miss it. What is somewhat mystifying however, is that the soldiers under Walt seem to know what is transpiring between he and the boy and they pass no judgment nor do they do anything to prevent or stop it.Anyway, when the soldiers pull out of Holland it is quick and Walt isn't man enough to face up to the fact that he will leave behind him a boy who is desperately in love with him. He sneaks off during the night. Jeroen is destroyed. It is only his mother's reappearance that helps him make it through the situation. However, it is also her reappearance that causes him to state that he is moving to Canada. We know he wants to find Walt.Most telling of all is that the film is actually a flashback - a rememberance - by Jereon as an adult, a (supposedly) gifted coreographer, who is creating a dance for the fortieth anniversary of Holland's liberation from the Nazis. He can't get the dance steps right and it is only through his memory of his time with Walt that he can bring the beautiful dance to life.There are a couple more, quite poignant moments that occur that I will not tell you about, because they should bring a few tears to your eyes, from joy and sadness.If you can get past the subject matter as we view it today, and focus on the fact that this is still a love story - one of unrequited, or rather unfulfilled, love, you will find yourself enjoying it quite a bit.The language is primarily Dutch, with a few lines of English here and there.",4,Well made

365430,A328S9RN3U5M68,6303238734,Grady Harp,"[7, 8]","FOR A LOST SOLDIER (Voor een verloren soldaat) is a 1992 Dutch film based on a novel by Rudi van Dantzig, adapted for the screen by Don Bloch, and directed by Roeland Kerbosch whose understanding of the concept of love is remarkably sensitive.  Some viewers may mislabel this film as inappropriate celebration of 'abnormal life styles' and that would be a sad comment on the level of consciousness that hopefully we have overcome.  Erase all old tapes and view this beautiful film as a pure exploration of the human being's ability to love and perhaps it will become the classic it deserves to be.The film is a reverie: a choreographer Jeroen Boman (Jeroen Krabb&eacute;) is distracted from his work by words and ideas and scenes that make him recall his childhood, and what follows is an explanation of his origins. The memory goes back to Holland in the 1940s as WW II is growing ever more a threat of Germany's determination to control the world.  Because of the threat of invasion and because of the paucity of food and essentials to living the families begin to send their children in trucks to the countryside where the children will be fed and protected by farmers far enough away from the cities to possibly escape annihilation by the German forces.  Maarten Smit appears as the young Jeroen Boman, transported to a farm where he feels out of place and quickly makes friends with another 'outsider'.  Together they discover a crashed airplane in a field and Jeroen begins to get in touch with his feelings.  Shortly the Canadians land in the little village to provide protection for the people, and while the soldiers all are attracted to the acutely available and willing girls, one soldier Walt Cook (Andrew Kelley) sites Jeroen and treats him well: the two are indeed separated by age but Walt is very young and very kind and gives Joeran the attention he longs for.  Very gradually and very subtly Walt and Jeroen find a mutual love and the two, isolated and lonely, begin a love affair - an affair while very strong in feeling is handled so delicately that it seems completely natural.  Eventually the Canadian troops are to leave and Walt departs on his own, leaving Jeroen to the returning attention of his family as they come to gather him home.As the flashbacks reveal it is this memory of first love that the adult Jeroen is trying to capture in his choreographic story.  The film ends with memories of the past evaporating in the air, memories that remain indelible in the adult Jeroen's mind.The entire cast is excellent, but it is the very straightforward demonstration of love between Andrew Kelley and Maarten Smit, under the wise guidance of director Roeland Kerbosch that makes this film so memorable. it belongs in the personal library of all those who respect courage and delicacy in the art of filmmaking.

The movie is well-crafted, structured around flashback, a deft mix of subtitled Dutch and English in reflection of the idiosyncratic communication that evolves between the main characters, and beautifully filmed in the soft light of northern Europe.  As a piece of cinematic craftmanship, I'd give it 4 stars.But then there's the story itself.  Can sexual relations between an adult and a child ever be excused by love or circumstances?  Before this movie, the answer for me was a resounding no.  After this movie, I simply don't know.  The man here is not a sexual predator in that he is not attracted to the boy by virtue of his youth.  Instead, he is a gay man doubly isolated by his sexual orientation and by being on foreign ground at the end of a world-shattering war.  And, coming across a gay boy likewise isolated from his home at the end of the same war, a bond is forged that did not have sex as its initial aim and came to include sex only after love was so deeply established as to have rendered age irrelevant.Or did it?  After all, the soldier is first attracted to the boy by his looks, not by anything he knew about the boy or his circumstances.  And can age ever be irrelevant to sex involving minors?  Do 12-year-olds ever know enough of themselves, their world, and its risks to be informed participants?If nothing else, this movie accomplishes something by making the question tenable.  But does it, in the end, make this love affair all right?  I simply don't know.This movie stands up as a thought-provoking film.  It should not, however, be read as an unambiguous justification for adult/child sex.  Since it, however, implies more than presents the ambiguities and could leave some thinking they've just watched an argument that child sex taboos are nothing more than unwarranted modern western uptightness, I discount it to 3 stars.",3,I'm Conflicted,1069027200,"11 17, 2003",2003,1997,"['Oh', 'What', 'say', 'movie', 'young', 'man', 'having', 'sex', '12-year-old', 'boy.First', 'easy', 'part', 'movie', 'well-crafted', 'structured', 'flashback', 'deft', 'mix', 'subtitled', 'Dutch', 'English', 'reflection', 'idiosyncratic', 'communication', 'main', 'characters', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'soft', 'light', 'northern', 'Europe', 'piece', 'cinematic', 'craftmanship', ""'d"", 'give', '4', 'stars.But', 'then', 'story', 'Can', 'sexual', 'relations', 'adult', 'child', 'ever', 'be', 'excused', 'love', 'circumstances', 'movie', 'answer', 'was', 'resounding', 'movie', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'man', 'here', 'not', 'sexual', 'predator', 'not', 'attracted', 'boy', 'virtue', 'youth', 'Instead', 'gay', 'man', 'doubly', 'isolated', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'being', 'foreign', 'ground', 'end', 'world-shattering', 'war', 'coming', 'gay', 'boy', 'likewise', 'isolated', 'home', 'end', 'same', 'war', 'bond', 'forged', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'sex', 'initial', 'aim', 'came', 'include', 'sex', 'only', 'love', 'was', 'so', 'deeply', 'established', 'have', 'rendered', 'age', 'irrelevant.Or', 'did', 'soldier', 'first', 'attracted', 'boy', 'looks', 'not', 'anything', 'knew', 'boy', 'circumstances', 'can', 'age', 'ever', 'be', 'irrelevant', 'sex', 'involving', 'minors', 'Do', '12-year-olds', 'ever', 'know', 'enough', 'world', 'risks', 'be', 'informed', 'participants', 'nothing', 'else', 'movie', 'something', 'making', 'question', 'tenable', 'end', 'make', 'love', 'affair', 'right', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.This', 'movie', 'up', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'however', 'be', 'read', 'unambiguous', 'justification', 'adult/child', 'sex', 'however', 'more', 'ambiguities', 'could', 'leave', 'thinking', ""'ve"", 'just', 'watched', 'argument', 'sex', 'taboos', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'unwarranted', 'modern', 'western', 'uptightness', 'discount', '3', 'stars']",N/A

But brave intentions do not necessarily translate into a great film.  For a much better executed exploration of a similar theme, try LIE (i.e. Long Island Expressway).  Problems: it's a big stretch to believe that the twelve year old Jeroen grew up to be a successful choreographer, based on the God awful ballet he's working on to recall the romance.  The ballet also yanks us from the past to the near present, not a good device in this film.  The Walt character, supposedly charismatic, is mostly wooden, as if uneasy at the role he plays.  On the other hand, the adolescent actors are uniformly good, especially Jeroen's friend Jan.  And the piety of the country family Jeroen lives with is both convincing and treated with welcome respect.  The affection that the family develops for Jeroen is also moving and nicely built.

Kids have to be protected, sometimes even from themselves. The fact that Jeroen was consenting doesn't matter. A 12 year old is not equipped with maturity and understanding to make those decisions, so why do the filmmakers want to glamourize  this?

While it is uncomfortable to watch, it is, at the same time, a terrific film. The young boy, Jeroen, goes through an awful lot in this movie. His whole life is torn apart. It's no wonder he would find comfort in the arms of a kind solider. Many people probably think of Walt as the villain. Did he really fall in love with Jeroen or is he just some sick pervert? Probably neither. At the time Walt meets Jeroen he is also going through his own emotional problems. The two souls meet each other and offer comfort. It is NOT ok for adults to have sex with children.

Jeroen (Maarten Smit) is a 12-year-old Dutch boy who is moved from his native hometown of Amsterdam to the countryside away from his mother. Smit's acting is really wonderful; he conveys such natural and sad expressions that a boy his age would show if separated from his family. After Holland is liberated from the Nazis, soldiers begin flocking into the countryside to receive a huge amount of praise from the locals. This is where Walt (Andrew Kelley), a 19-year-old Canadian soldier, comes into the picture. He immediately catches Jeroen's eye and vice versa. What unexpectedly results is a friendship and ultimately a romance that transcends age.Jeroen and Walt's relationship is a rather interesting yet beautiful one. It begins with mostly body language and intuition since Walt cannot speak or understand Dutch and Jeroen cannot understand or speak much English. As time passes however, Jeroen starts to become more proficient in English and thus their relationship begins to blossom. While the idea of such a young boy having a sexual relationship with an older young man seems repulsive to most (especially Americans in my experience), I think that the director handled this aspect appropriately and wonderfully. The closeness of the young and older boy is that of anyone who has seriously been in love: passionate and full of amicability. While Jeroen and Walt's sexual encounters may be questionable with Jeroen's age in mind, both boys' obvious feelings for one another is undeniable. I found Walt calling him his ""prince"" particularly endearing and expressive of his feelings for the young Dutchman.In the end, For A Lost Soldier is a story of love between two human beings. Joy and sadness make up the content of the film, and it moved me beyond words. Yes, it is controversial due to the fact that Jeroen is only 12 years old. However, this story is based on the real life events of Dutch writer and ballet dancer Rudi van Dantzig and deserves to be told. The film is a touching representation of how he felt all those years ago. If you can keep an open mind and heart, I can almost definitely guarantee that For A Lost Soldier will move you beyond words and thought as it has for me.",5,A Beautiful Tale of First Love and Heartbreak,1248220800,"07 22, 2009",2009,2274,"['Lost', 'Soldier', 'tale', 'first', 'love', 'WWII', 'post-WWII', 'Holland', 'Jeroen', 'Maarten', 'Smit', '12-year-old', 'Dutch', 'boy', 'who', 'moved', 'native', 'hometown', 'Amsterdam', 'countryside', 'away', 'mother', 'Smit', 'acting', 'really', 'wonderful', 'conveys', 'such', 'natural', 'sad', 'expressions', 'boy', 'age', 'would', 'show', 'separated', 'family', 'Holland', 'liberated', 'Nazis', 'soldiers', 'begin', 'flocking', 'countryside', 'receive', 'huge', 'amount', 'praise', 'locals', 'where', 'Walt', 'Andrew', 'Kelley', '19-year-old', 'Canadian', 'soldier', 'picture', 'immediately', 'Jeroen', 'eye', 'vice', 'versa', 'What', 'unexpectedly', 'results', 'friendship', 'ultimately', 'romance', 'age.Jeroen', 'Walt', 'relationship', 'rather', 'interesting', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'one', 'mostly', 'body', 'language', 'intuition', 'Walt', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'understand', 'Dutch', 'Jeroen', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'speak', 'much', 'English', 'time', 'however', 'Jeroen', 'become', 'more', 'proficient', 'English', 'thus', 'relationship', 'blossom', 'idea', 'such', 'young', 'boy', 'having', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'older', 'young', 'man', 'repulsive', 'most', 'especially', 'Americans', 'experience', 'think', 'director', 'handled', 'aspect', 'appropriately', 'wonderfully', 'closeness', 'young', 'older', 'boy', 'anyone', 'who', 'seriously', 'been', 'love', 'passionate', 'full', 'amicability', 'Jeroen', 'Walt', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'may', 'be', 'questionable', 'Jeroen', 'age', 'mind', 'boys', 'obvious', 'feelings', 'one', 'undeniable', 'found', 'Walt', 'calling', 'prince', 'particularly', 'endearing', 'expressive', 'feelings', 'young', 'Dutchman.In', 'end', 'Lost', 'Soldier', 'story', 'love', 'two', 'human', 'beings', 'Joy', 'sadness', 'make', 'up', 'content', 'film', 'moved', 'words', 'Yes', 'controversial', 'due', 'fact', 'Jeroen', 'only', '12', 'years', 'old', 'However', 'story', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'Dutch', 'writer', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'Rudi', 'van', 'Dantzig', 'be', 'told', 'film', 'touching', 'representation', 'how', 'felt', 'years', 'ago', 'can', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'heart', 'can', 'almost', 'definitely', 'guarantee', 'Lost', 'Soldier', 'will', 'move', 'words', 'thought']",N/A

Set during the closing months of World War II, it concerns a 12 year old boy, Jeroen (Maarten Smit), who is sent by his parents to the Dutch countryside to avoid the hunger in Amsterdam.  He is taken in by a kindly family, who grow to love him like a son.  While there he experiences liberation by the Allied forces.  He meets a young Canadian soldier, Walt Cook (Andrew Kelley), who initiates a more than romantic relationship with the boy.  Shortly thereafter the soldiers, including Walt, move on, leaving a heartbroken Jeroen behind.The film deals with this topic in an extremely restrained manner, never sensationalizing nor exploiting it.  We never really get to know Walt or the reasons behind his attraction to the boy. This makes sense, since the story is told from Jeroen's point of view, and he is unable to communicate with the soldier beyond a few words.  Jeroen's love for his soldier is more understandable:  his loneliness, the hero worship he feels for this liberator, and his own awakening sexuality.Smit gives an extraordinary performance, while Kelley is fine as well.  The supporting cast is excellent, especially the members of the foster family.  There are many nice touches to this film.  It is refreshing that the foster family is neither evil nor abusive, but warm-hearted and kind.  There are many moving scenes.  The most touching occurs when Walt teaches Jeroen to jitterbug.
