I started buying these DVD's from Amazon because, having purchased Season 1 in a store, I was unable to find any of the others.  I am glad and grateful that indeed Amazon was able to direct me to them at a price I could afford.My personal opinion is that MacGyver is one of the best shows that ever appeared on TV.  My mother and I both enjoyed them tremendously, so much so that we named our Dalmatian dog after the character.  The name proved fortuitous, because like the TV hero, the dog survived a fall which really should have killed him!  In any event, viewing these videos again has been a poignant and nostalgic experience, but a very delightful one.
