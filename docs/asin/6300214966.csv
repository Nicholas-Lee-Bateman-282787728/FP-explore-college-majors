Five stars isn't enough for this movie, a wonderful movie, and one of the most heartbreaking movies there is (the end of ""The Third Man"" always gets me as well).  It is a brutal ride, but feels real, and tells a story that if often not told, about the stacked deck that black people faced in those times (a book on the subject just came out, may have won a putlizer prize about the prison system was nothing more than enforced slavery, but the name escapes me now).A movie that is well worth your attention, but I suggest that when you do watch it, you watch it from beginning to end without interruptions, the way movies should be used, also avoid the pan and scan versions.

When I realized, within the first few minutes, that Sounder was the name of the dog I got a little afraid that this was going to turn into one of those Disney films that revolves around a special pooch, but thankfully this film really doesn't concern itself with the dog.  I haven't read the book it was adapted from, so I'm sure the direction that book took or if the dog had a more central role, but I'm happy that this film seemed to be more concerned with the human element than the canine one.That said, overall I'm pretty happy with this film.  I wasn't completely won over with certain aspects of the film, but I'll spend my review focusing on the positive.I am a big fan of `Hud', and what I loved so much about that films gritty detail I also love about this film.  Martin Ritt has a way with creating a realistic portrayal of life without playing to close to sympathies.  There are no forced emotions here.  Even when someone is doing something beautifully sympathetic (as in Mrs. Boatwright's attempts to help the Morgan family) it is approached in a way that feels authentic.  Sure, our heartstrings are swelling but not in that schmaltzy, saccharine kind of way.  This atmosphere is helped by the script, which thankfully strays away from being too melodramatic.  There is hardship and there is injustice, but it is handled appropriately, with the right amount of distance to create something objective.  The script isn't perfect (I did find that the white characters tended to become stereotypical caricatures) but overall it displayed more good than bad.The acting for the most part was very impressive.  Kevin Hooks (the films only TRUE lead) is rather remarkable here.  Sadly, he is the only child actor who nails it for me.  The other child performances here are stiff and disappointing.  Cicely Tyson and Paul Winfield were astonishingly good.  I would have placed them both in supporting categories (where Tyson would have won for me) but I'm happy that they received Oscar nominations none-the-less.  Tyson especially is remarkable here.  She completely understands how to use subtlety to leave a devastating impact.In the end I totally recommend this film.  I give it a solid B+.  It has a lot going for it, and while I feel that some things could have been shifted to attain a more well rounded and lasting feel, there really isn't a whole lot to be disappointed with here.",4,"Thankfully, it's not about a dog...",1275004800,"05 28, 2010",2010,2449,"['did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Sounder', 'When', 'realized', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'Sounder', 'was', 'name', 'dog', 'got', 'little', 'afraid', 'was', 'going', 'turn', 'one', 'Disney', 'films', 'special', 'pooch', 'thankfully', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'concern', 'dog', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'was', 'adapted', ""'m"", 'sure', 'direction', 'book', 'took', 'dog', 'had', 'more', 'central', 'role', ""'m"", 'happy', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'concerned', 'human', 'element', 'canine', 'one.That', 'said', 'overall', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'happy', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'won', 'over', 'certain', 'aspects', 'film', ""'ll"", 'spend', 'review', 'focusing', 'positive.I', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Hud', 'what', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'films', 'gritty', 'detail', 'also', 'love', 'film', 'Martin', 'Ritt', 'way', 'creating', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'life', 'playing', 'close', 'sympathies', 'are', 'forced', 'emotions', 'here', 'Even', 'when', 'someone', 'doing', 'something', 'beautifully', 'sympathetic', 'Mrs.', 'Boatwright', 'attempts', 'help', 'Morgan', 'family', 'approached', 'way', 'authentic', 'Sure', 'heartstrings', 'are', 'swelling', 'not', 'schmaltzy', 'saccharine', 'kind', 'way', 'atmosphere', 'helped', 'script', 'thankfully', 'away', 'being', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'hardship', 'injustice', 'handled', 'appropriately', 'right', 'amount', 'distance', 'create', 'something', 'objective', 'script', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'did', 'find', 'white', 'characters', 'tended', 'become', 'stereotypical', 'caricatures', 'overall', 'displayed', 'more', 'good', 'bad.The', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'very', 'impressive', 'Kevin', 'Hooks', 'films', 'only', 'TRUE', 'lead', 'rather', 'remarkable', 'here', 'Sadly', 'only', 'child', 'actor', 'who', 'other', 'child', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'stiff', 'disappointing', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'Paul', 'Winfield', 'were', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'would', 'have', 'placed', 'supporting', 'categories', 'where', 'Tyson', 'would', 'have', 'won', ""'m"", 'happy', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'none-the-less', 'Tyson', 'especially', 'remarkable', 'here', 'completely', 'how', 'use', 'subtlety', 'leave', 'devastating', 'impact.In', 'end', 'totally', 'recommend', 'film', 'give', 'solid', 'B+', 'lot', 'going', 'feel', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shifted', 'attain', 'more', 'well', 'rounded', 'lasting', 'feel', 'really', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'be', 'disappointed', 'here']",Sounder

Here, the peacefulness of rural Louisiana belies a story of desperate lives.A family of black sharecroppers nearly starves during each long winter. They fall in debt to the farmer/store owner then work his fields for an entire growing season not to get ahead, but just to pay back what is owed. It's a circle that seemingly can't be broken.After a raccoon escapes him during a night hunt and not sure how to feed his hungry family, Nathan Lee Morgan (Paul Winfield) steals some ham from his employer. He's immediately arrested.The family's hound, Sounder (the best huntin' dog there is) bays while Nathan Lee is being taken away in the back of an open truck. A cruel guard sprays the dog's face and right shoulder with rifle shot and the wounded yelping animal runs off into some woods, perhaps to die.Once Nathan is convicted and sentenced, his wife (Cicely Tyson) isn't told to which prison farm he's being sent. She and her three children must work the crops alone this spring.Later, on a lead from a kindly white lady the oldest Morgan boy, David Lee (Kevin Hooks) goes in search of his daddy. What he finds instead is a possible way to escape a hopeless existence.It's a poignant story --painful even-- yet throughout, the perseverance of the human spirit as well as unshakable familial love is as palpable as the blazing heat and stifling humidity of a breezeless Louisiana August afternoon.SOUNDER is also available onDVD.",5,Sounder will come back....,1248134400,"07 21, 2009",2009,1504,"['Martin', 'Ritt', 'SOUNDER', '1972', 'set', 'depths', 'Great', 'Depression', 'Here', 'peacefulness', 'rural', 'Louisiana', 'story', 'desperate', 'lives.A', 'family', 'black', 'sharecroppers', 'nearly', 'starves', 'long', 'winter', 'fall', 'debt', 'farmer/store', 'owner', 'then', 'work', 'fields', 'entire', 'growing', 'season', 'not', 'get', 'ahead', 'just', 'pay', 'back', 'what', 'owed', 'circle', 'seemingly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'broken.After', 'raccoon', 'night', 'hunt', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'feed', 'hungry', 'family', 'Nathan', 'Lee', 'Morgan', 'Paul', 'Winfield', 'ham', 'employer', 'immediately', 'arrested.The', 'family', 'hound', 'Sounder', 'best', 'huntin', 'dog', 'bays', 'Nathan', 'Lee', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'back', 'open', 'truck', 'cruel', 'guard', 'dog', 'face', 'right', 'shoulder', 'rifle', 'shot', 'wounded', 'yelping', 'animal', 'off', 'woods', 'perhaps', 'die.Once', 'Nathan', 'convicted', 'sentenced', 'wife', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', ""n't"", 'told', 'prison', 'farm', 'being', 'sent', 'three', 'children', 'must', 'work', 'crops', 'alone', 'spring.Later', 'lead', 'kindly', 'white', 'lady', 'oldest', 'Morgan', 'boy', 'David', 'Lee', 'Kevin', 'Hooks', 'search', 'daddy', 'What', 'instead', 'possible', 'way', 'escape', 'hopeless', 'existence.It', 'poignant', 'story', 'painful', 'even', 'yet', 'perseverance', 'human', 'spirit', 'as', 'well', 'unshakable', 'familial', 'love', 'as', 'palpable', 'blazing', 'heat', 'stifling', 'humidity', 'breezeless', 'Louisiana', 'August', 'afternoon.SOUNDER', 'also', 'available', 'onDVD']",Sounder

216050,A396SBGKAOLTZE,6300214966,Chris Aldridge,"[27, 28]","""Sounder"" is a film of sublime beauty- one of the most powerful films for anyone to see. Even though the title made no immediate sense to me (it's the name of the family dog), the plot and script is choice and proves what I've always believed regarding most scripts: less is more. Films which feature close, reverent African-American families are still rare in the 21st century, and this was a *1972* release- which broke ground when it was nominated at that year's Academy Awards for lead actor (Paul Winfield), lead actress (Cicely Tyson), screenplay (Lonne Elder III), and best picture. Only director Martin Ritt was not nominated- which was a travesty, but the Academy is historically famous for bonehead decisions. At any rate, I was happy to see a film which shows family supporting each other- even in the event of the father's absence. I won't say why that happens, but it's only temporary, and his third act return- staged against a long stretch of open farm field and spotlighting a barefoot Tyson and limping Winfield running into each other's arms- is a bewitching, magical, sequence in the film. Everyone is a standout, including Kevin Hooks's pre-teen who needs to grow up overnight and to Carmen Matthews as the neighbor who supports and tries to help the family. Even more amazing is that this is a G-rated film; your whole family- black, white, or brown- will absolutely cherish it.

216053,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6300214966,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","There is a viscerally powerful moment in this 1972 film classic that still gets to me. It's the look of desperately aching relief on Rebecca Morgan's face and the palpable sound of her breathless anticipation as she runs down the long dirt road to embrace her husband Nathan Lee for the first time since he went to prison. I almost get as tear-drenched as she does. Whether tenaciously holding her family together or dealing cautiously with the powerful white community, Cicely Tyson plays Rebecca with a searing combination of emotional eloquence and subtle nuance. Yet, her performance is not the dominant factor of the film, as director Martin Ritt, a specialist in human dramas set in the South, has directed a wondrous ensemble piece focused on a family of black sharecroppers in Depression-era Louisiana. Based on a children's book by William H. Armstrong and adapted by Lonne Elder III, the movie is blissfully free of stereotypes or dramatic manipulation.The plot is compact. Nathan Lee takes his son David Lee raccoon hunting with their aptly named dog, Sounder (he howls when he sees them). The family hits particularly hard times when Nathan Lee steals a ham for his family and is carted off to a prison camp for a year. David Lee sets out to find him and happens upon a school run by Camille, a kindly but firm teacher. She teaches him about important African-American figures in history, and he becomes desperate to go to school. David Lee returns home, and soon after, a maimed Nathan Lee returns as well. Not wanting to take advantage of Camille's offer to stay with her to go to school, David Lee is convinced by his father that school is the only thing he should pursue.It is a rare thing, a family drama that does not patronize to its audience and remains compelling to adults, and it is especially shameful that the film rarely resurfaces for new generations to enjoy. Beyond Tyson, Paul Winfield is equally affecting as Nathan Lee, and in the pivotal role of David Lee, Kevin Hooks (now a successful TV director) brings strength to his plaintive performance.

Radnitz) --- Only director Martin Ritt was not nominated, which was a travesty, but the Academy is historically famous for not to bright decisions --- At any rate, it's nice to see a film which shows true family support- even in the event of the father's absence --- Won't reveal what happens, but it's only temporary and his third act return staged against a long stretch of open farm field and spotlighting a barefoot Tyson and limping Winfield running into each other's arms is a bewitching, magical, sequence in the film --- Can guarantee there won't be a dry eye in the house --- Entire cast is a standout, including Kevin Hooks as the preteen who needs to grow up overnight and to Carmen Matthews as the neighbor Mrs Boatwright who quietly helps the family --- A must to be watched film that will absolutely leave you with memories to cherish.Under the production staff of:Martin Ritt  - DirectorRobert B.

After all, what DVD is worth thirty dollars if it isn't a multiple disc set? I got this at Wal-Mart for seven dollars, so why pay thirty? Get real guys, and start shopping around. This isn't a rare DVD, you can find it anywhere. If a movie store can rent it, then they can order you one for way cheaper too.",5,Sounder,1178928000,"05 12, 2007",2007,590,"['wonderful', 'movie', 'man', 'separated', 'family', 'down', 'southern', 'states', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'son', 'perfect', 'part', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'over', 'kids', 'love', 'too', 'one', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'much', 'website', 'what', 'DVD', 'worth', 'thirty', 'dollars', ""n't"", 'multiple', 'disc', 'set', 'got', 'Wal-Mart', 'seven', 'dollars', 'so', 'why', 'pay', 'thirty', 'Get', 'real', 'guys', 'start', 'shopping', 'around', ""n't"", 'rare', 'DVD', 'can', 'find', 'anywhere', 'movie', 'store', 'can', 'rent', 'then', 'can', 'order', 'one', 'way', 'cheaper', 'too']",Sounder

That pretty much sums up 1972's &#34;Sounder.&#34; It's a quiet tale about the loving bond of a family with no action (except one shooting scene) or dazzling special effects. As such, some people criticize it as slow, which it is, but that's because it's a rural family DRAMA.If you like other rural dramas like The Apostle, The Great Santini and Undertow, you'll probably appreciate Sounder, although it's the least of these, in my humble opinion.",4,Slice-of-life drama...,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,515,"['black', 'family', 'sharecroppers', 'Louisana', '1930s', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', '1972', '34', 'Sounder.', '34', 'quiet', 'tale', 'loving', 'bond', 'family', 'action', 'one', 'shooting', 'scene', 'dazzling', 'special', 'effects', 'such', 'people', 'criticize', 'slow', 'rural', 'family', 'DRAMA.If', 'other', 'rural', 'dramas', 'Apostle', 'Great', 'Santini', 'Undertow', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'appreciate', 'Sounder', 'least', 'humble', 'opinion']",Sounder
