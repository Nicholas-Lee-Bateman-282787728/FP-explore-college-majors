1091329,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B000TLOMPE,David Baldwin,"[0, 0]","It's interesting that back in 1991 the selling point of ""Strictly Business"" was Tommy Davidson who was a featured player on ""In Living Color"" and Joseph C. Phillips who was a later cast member on ""The Cosby Show"".  Naturally today the focus would be on Halle Berry, one of the most glamorous women to ever grace the silver screen, and Samuel L. Jackson, one of film's greatest actors.  On the surface the film is a reworking of the old uptown versus downtown theme.  What gives the film luster is that it is an interesting microcosm of the State of African-American Union of it's time. It's not dated just a specific commentary on what was going on in 1991.  The cast is uniformly engaging.  Berry in probably one of her earliest films is more than just a pretty face as the urban flygirl who catches the eye of a corporate climber (Phillips).  Jackson is effective in the brief time he's on screen as the hard-nosed stockroom supervisor.  I debated whether to give this four or five stars but felt it was just a tad conventional to merit the full five star treatment.",4,Halle Berry Had It Back In 1991,1346457600,"09 1, 2012",2012,1068,"['interesting', 'back', '1991', 'selling', 'point', 'Strictly', 'Business', 'was', 'Tommy', 'Davidson', 'who', 'was', 'featured', 'player', 'Living', 'Color', 'Joseph', 'C.', 'Phillips', 'who', 'was', 'later', 'cast', 'member', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Naturally', 'today', 'focus', 'would', 'be', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'one', 'most', 'glamorous', 'women', 'ever', 'grace', 'silver', 'screen', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'one', 'film', 'greatest', 'actors', 'surface', 'film', 'reworking', 'old', 'uptown', 'versus', 'downtown', 'theme', 'What', 'film', 'luster', 'interesting', 'microcosm', 'State', 'African-American', 'Union', 'time', 'not', 'dated', 'just', 'specific', 'commentary', 'what', 'was', 'going', '1991', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'engaging', 'Berry', 'probably', 'one', 'earliest', 'films', 'more', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'urban', 'flygirl', 'who', 'eye', 'corporate', 'climber', 'Phillips', 'Jackson', 'effective', 'brief', 'time', 'screen', 'hard-nosed', 'stockroom', 'supervisor', 'debated', 'give', 'four', 'five', 'stars', 'felt', 'was', 'just', 'tad', 'conventional', 'merit', 'full', 'five', 'star', 'treatment']",N/A

See back then it was about having fun so the comedies we watched were just fun. Plus this one was pretty funny and had a slight sense of awareness(some comedies had that even Boomerang). Nowadays what passes for comedy is sheer garbage just like these overrated movies that Hollywood oversells to death. At any rate..The story: Waymon Tisdale(Joseph C. Phillips) is a bank investor that is not too happy about his love life with his swishy and domineering girlfriend Diedre(Anne-Marie Johnson). He meets a beautiful girl named Natalie(Halle Berry) and ends up falling for her. He calls upon the help of a mailroom clerk named Bobby(Tommy Davidson)to aid him in getting her.Tommy Davidson is funny  as hell in this movie. So is Joseph C. Phillips. He is pretty good as the square but likable Waymon Tisdale. Halle Berry was just gorgeous here as Natalie and to tell you the truth I like her 90s movies better than the junk she's in now. There are too many funny situations to name them all and Strictly Business perfectly captures everything about the 90s urban culture whether its the music or the fashion.Pay no attention to pompous and sheep-minded critics that cant even write real reviews and dont even have the decency to open up an account(still hiding behind the customer review option huh? Lazy punks). If you want a 90s comedy that's fun to watch then look no further.

1091336,AUKHEBWDCODPF,B000TLOMPE,"Pembroke ""Nostalgia Fan""","[19, 21]","A romantic comedy that doesn't give enough credit to the co-stars Tommy Davidson (In Living Color), Anne Marie Johnson, & Samuel L. Jackson. Joseph C. Phillips and Halle Berry deliver the theme of the story well - Phillips playing the role of a ""square"" investment banker who is smitten by a beautiful nightclub entrepreneur(Berry).  Phillips feels Berry is out of his league and feels he's not hip enough to attract her, so he seeks the advice of his friend (Davidson) who works in the mailroom, on how to dress-to-impress, and to ultimately be introduced to her.  Phillips has another problem though - he already has a girlfriend (Johnson) who is a domineering, vain, controlling, self serving, arrogant yuppie who plans to marry him for appearances and for all the other wrong reasons.  Samuel L. Jackson delivers humor in a short-lived way as the hard-nose mailroom superintendant.  To add more substance to the romantic comedy, the story shows how you can loose yourself, your identity, and ultimately your friends & your woman by trying to live a double life, climbing the corporate ladder, all the while safeguarding against corporate backstabbing and sabotage.

1091337,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B000TLOMPE,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[0, 0]","Strictly Business is NOT a throwaway movie as some reviewers would have you believe. I found this movie very entertaining in spite of the weak plot. The ideas are good ones but the concept and execution are lacking.The main reason to buy this movie is Samuel L. Jackson. He's in this movie credited as ""SAM JACKSON"", and in the few moments he's onscreen as a mailroom boss he gives such an amazing performance that it makes all the other actors look like amateurs. He shows us that a great performer can overcome the weakest material by making a strong effort. While this movie will be remembered as one of Halle Berry's earlier movies (it's one of her better ones) Samuel L. Jackson's performance is worth the purchase of this DVD alone.The weak plot revolves around a streetwise guy (Tommy Davidson) helping a straight-laced Wayman Tinsdale (Joseph C. Phillips) get with Club promoter Natalie (Halle Berry) in exchange for a spot in a training program. Its too bad Natalie wasn't a better-developed character. I wonder if she would have picked Wayman had the writers given her a personality and a story. The story assumes she'll go out with him because he wears flashy clothes, big money and a nice car. Shallow, Shallow, Shallow.My biggest beef with this movie are that the female characters and aren't fully developed; they have stereotype personalities. They seem to be there just for Wayman and Davidson's character to drool over or argue with. I wish some African-American filmmaker would show some courage and depict strong female leads next to their male leads. All those flaws aside I still love this concept and think it could work if done properly.Watching this movie inspired me to write my own story based on the African-American workplace. I fleshed some things out so it has fully developed, well-defined characters (especially the women), and a plot revolving around the actual workplace, not social situations.
