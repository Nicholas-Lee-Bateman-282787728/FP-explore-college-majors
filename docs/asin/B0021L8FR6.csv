Each of the seasons in its separate box, shrink-wrapped and sealed.Anyone who already has the individual seasons should have no reason to get this unless they wish to upgrade from DVD to Blu. Those who don't have LOST yet, this should the right set to buy or... wait until the 6-seasons sets become available next year.To me, LOST is the best TV series of the third millennium, so far. In fact, I am very surprised that a TV series could be made this good these days when cost cutting and declining standards seem to be the norm everywhere else. But, not in the world of television, it seems. Or, rather, LOST and a couple other shows (Heroes is another favorite of mine) happen to be the exception.LOST employs a cast of dozens to tell a big story. How big the story is? Well... five years and it's still going so... it's big. Slowly, what begins as your run of the mill airliner crash survivors story keeps adding layers on top of layers, expands, branches out in unexpected directions and, episode after episode after episode keeps us mesmerized, guessing, mourning those lost and left behind, surprised, intrigued and always ready for more. 100 episodes later and we are used to expect the unexpected now. I will not reveal the plot but it's probably proper to note that you are going to see peoples struggling to overcome extreme circumstances, stories of friendship, love, solidarity, spontaneous cooperation, the inevitable conflicts between people of many different upbringings, chasing different dreams, sometimes competing for the same rewards. Facing danger, the unknown and, what appears to be the incomprehensible, the initial state of anarchy spontaneously gains textures and a fragile structures are formed only to unravel or morph into something else.LOST has an incredibly well-written story line, great acting and it's shown to us in the highest quality picture and sound. It is, without a doubt, one of the best TV series I've watched in a long, long time. If you haven't watched the weekly episodes on TV, you should consider yourself lucky. I haven't either and I am glad I didn't have to wait, week after week, for yet another mystery to solve itself in the next episodes. We are very likely to go through the first five seasons at least once, possibly twice before season six is released.Oh, and, one more thing that you should keep in mind - but you will constantly fail at it: NOTHING is what what it seems to be and nobody is what he/she claims to be.Happy viewing :)___________________________________________As a frame of reference, this set was available at Amazon for ONE day, on Dec. 9, 2009, for 108.99. I am highly doubtful that such an opportunity will present itself again until maybe next year when the 6-seasons set could be made available for one day or a for a few hour at a comparatively great price.",5,"FOUND - the best TV series in a long, long, long  time",1260230400,"12 8, 2009",2009,2937,"['Everyone', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'NOTHING', 'set', 'not', 'individual', 'edition', 'seasons', 'separate', 'box', 'shrink-wrapped', 'sealed.Anyone', 'who', 'already', 'individual', 'seasons', 'should', 'have', 'reason', 'get', 'wish', 'upgrade', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'LOST', 'yet', 'should', 'right', 'set', 'buy', 'wait', '6-seasons', 'become', 'available', 'next', 'year.To', 'LOST', 'best', 'TV', 'series', 'third', 'millennium', 'so', 'far', 'fact', 'am', 'very', 'surprised', 'TV', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'good', 'days', 'when', 'cost', 'cutting', 'declining', 'standards', 'seem', 'be', 'norm', 'everywhere', 'else', 'not', 'world', 'television', 'rather', 'LOST', 'couple', 'other', 'shows', 'Heroes', 'favorite', 'mine', 'happen', 'be', 'exception.LOST', 'cast', 'dozens', 'tell', 'big', 'story', 'How', 'big', 'story', 'Well', 'five', 'years', 'still', 'going', 'so', 'big', 'Slowly', 'what', 'run', 'mill', 'airliner', 'crash', 'survivors', 'story', 'adding', 'layers', 'top', 'layers', 'expands', 'branches', 'out', 'unexpected', 'directions', 'episode', 'episode', 'episode', 'keeps', 'mesmerized', 'guessing', 'mourning', 'lost', 'left', 'behind', 'surprised', 'intrigued', 'always', 'ready', 'more', '100', 'episodes', 'later', 'are', 'used', 'expect', 'unexpected', 'now', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'plot', 'probably', 'proper', 'note', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'peoples', 'struggling', 'overcome', 'extreme', 'circumstances', 'stories', 'friendship', 'love', 'solidarity', 'spontaneous', 'cooperation', 'inevitable', 'conflicts', 'people', 'many', 'different', 'upbringings', 'chasing', 'different', 'dreams', 'sometimes', 'competing', 'same', 'rewards', 'Facing', 'danger', 'unknown', 'what', 'be', 'incomprehensible', 'initial', 'state', 'anarchy', 'spontaneously', 'gains', 'textures', 'fragile', 'structures', 'are', 'formed', 'only', 'unravel', 'morph', 'something', 'else.LOST', 'incredibly', 'well-written', 'story', 'line', 'great', 'acting', 'shown', 'highest', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'series', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'weekly', 'episodes', 'TV', 'should', 'consider', 'lucky', 'have', ""n't"", 'either', 'am', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'week', 'week', 'yet', 'mystery', 'solve', 'next', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'likely', 'go', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'least', 'once', 'possibly', 'twice', 'season', 'six', 'released.Oh', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'should', 'keep', 'mind', 'will', 'constantly', 'fail', 'NOTHING', 'what', 'what', 'be', 'nobody', 'what', 'he/she', 'be.Happy', 'viewing', 'frame', 'reference', 'set', 'was', 'available', 'Amazon', 'ONE', 'day', 'Dec.', '9', '2009', '108.99', 'am', 'highly', 'doubtful', 'opportunity', 'will', 'present', 'again', 'maybe', 'next', 'year', 'when', '6-seasons', 'set', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'available', 'one', 'day', 'few', 'hour', 'comparatively', 'great', 'price']",Lost: The Complete Seasons 1-5
