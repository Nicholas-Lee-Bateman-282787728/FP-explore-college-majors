410220,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6304263465,Acute Observer,"[0, 4]","Teen Wolf, 1985 filmThe story starts with a teenager playing basketball. His team is losing badly. ""Chub"" hides his snacks. Scotty talks to the coach, Bobby Finstock, about ""changes"". Scotty doesn't want to be ""average"". He developed acute hearing of an ultra-sonic dog whistle. Scotty delivers goods to the drama class. Can Scotty buy a keg of beer without an ID? [In a movie.] A friend rides on the roof of a van while there is a song for entertainment. Scotty goes to a crowded party. A couple shows off on the floor. A bowl of Jello is dumped onto a girl. Scotty and his girl are pushed into a closet. Scotty returns home and looks in a mirror to see changes. His Dad has an explanation! What will he do? The next morning things are back to normal. ""Werewolves are people like everyone else.""Scott gives correct answers in class. But he has to run to the Boy's Room. Later he surprises his friend Styles in the garage. ""What can I say?"" A keen sense of smell is useful here. There is another basketball game. [Does the other team look older?] There is a fight for the ball. Scotty wins! He shows his skills. [The fur hides his skilled double.] Scotty is the big hero now! [Believable?] Mr. T. is still the Vice-Principal. People ask for Scotty's autograph. Scotty acts in a play and does very well in bowling. Pamela throws a gutter ball. There is a conflict with Pamela's boyfriend Mick. Scotty's friend Styles now owns a big van. [An acrobat doubles for Scotty.] Scott's Dad tells about his past. Scott doesn't want to be average. Scott attends the dance. [Is there another skilled double dancing?] Buff and Scott dance. Mick attacks Scott [to add drama and conflict]. Mr. T. threatens Scott until his Dad intervenes.Scott wants to be himself in the play. ""Bummer."" he can't do ""the wolf"" anymore. This disappoints his basketball coach. Chubby sinks the ball. Scotty's team does much better now. [Is the fix in?] In the last minute the score is nearly even. A foul will allow Scotty two free throws and a winning score. Scotty knows his true love at last. A happy ending?This is an about average story that could have been improved with a better writer and script. Does this echo the ""Ugly Duckling"" fairy tale? Is this the hidden fantasy of most average people? This story lacks ""bite"" to make it above average. Showing teenage life alone does not make a good movie. Having a hereditary disease isn't really funny. Stories of werewolves followed any outbreak of rabies in olden times. A bite transfers the disease and resulted in a popular legend. Stories about vampires are usually more popular. Some say economic hard times create an interest in horror movies, in the 1930 and in today's ""Great Recession"".",2,A Teenager Who is Different,1347840000,"09 17, 2012",2012,2715,"['Teen', 'Wolf', '1985', 'filmThe', 'story', 'teenager', 'playing', 'basketball', 'team', 'losing', 'badly', 'Chub', 'snacks', 'Scotty', 'talks', 'coach', 'Bobby', 'Finstock', 'changes', 'Scotty', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'average', 'developed', 'acute', 'hearing', 'ultra-sonic', 'dog', 'whistle', 'Scotty', 'delivers', 'goods', 'drama', 'class', 'Can', 'Scotty', 'buy', 'keg', 'beer', 'ID', '[', 'movie', ']', 'friend', 'roof', 'van', 'song', 'entertainment', 'Scotty', 'crowded', 'party', 'couple', 'off', 'floor', 'bowl', 'Jello', 'dumped', 'girl', 'Scotty', 'girl', 'are', 'pushed', 'closet', 'Scotty', 'home', 'mirror', 'see', 'changes', 'Dad', 'explanation', 'What', 'will', 'do', 'next', 'morning', 'things', 'are', 'back', 'normal', 'Werewolves', 'are', 'people', 'everyone', 'else', 'Scott', 'correct', 'answers', 'class', 'run', 'Boy', 'Room', 'Later', 'friend', 'Styles', 'garage', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'keen', 'sense', 'smell', 'useful', 'here', 'basketball', 'game', '[', 'other', 'team', 'look', 'older', ']', 'fight', 'ball', 'Scotty', 'skills', '[', 'fur', 'skilled', 'double', ']', 'Scotty', 'big', 'hero', 'now', '[', 'Believable', 'Mr.', 'T.', 'still', 'Vice-Principal', 'People', 'ask', 'Scotty', 'autograph', 'Scotty', 'acts', 'play', 'very', 'well', 'bowling', 'Pamela', 'gutter', 'ball', 'conflict', 'Pamela', 'boyfriend', 'Mick', 'Scotty', 'friend', 'Styles', 'now', 'big', 'van', '[', 'acrobat', 'doubles', 'Scotty', ']', 'Scott', 'Dad', 'past', 'Scott', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'average', 'Scott', 'dance', '[', 'there', 'skilled', 'double', 'dancing', ']', 'Buff', 'Scott', 'dance', 'Mick', 'Scott', '[', 'add', 'drama', 'conflict', ']', 'Mr.', 'T.', 'Scott', 'Dad', 'intervenes.Scott', 'be', 'play', 'Bummer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'wolf', 'anymore', 'basketball', 'coach', 'Chubby', 'ball', 'Scotty', 'team', 'much', 'better', 'now', '[', 'fix', ']', 'last', 'minute', 'score', 'nearly', 'even', 'foul', 'will', 'allow', 'Scotty', 'two', 'free', 'throws', 'winning', 'score', 'Scotty', 'true', 'love', 'last', 'happy', 'ending', 'average', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'better', 'writer', 'script', 'echo', 'Ugly', 'Duckling', 'fairy', 'tale', 'hidden', 'fantasy', 'most', 'average', 'people', 'story', 'bite', 'make', 'above', 'average', 'Showing', 'teenage', 'life', 'alone', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'Having', 'hereditary', 'disease', ""n't"", 'really', 'funny', 'Stories', 'werewolves', 'followed', 'outbreak', 'rabies', 'olden', 'times', 'bite', 'transfers', 'disease', 'resulted', 'popular', 'legend', 'Stories', 'vampires', 'are', 'usually', 'more', 'popular', 'say', 'economic', 'hard', 'times', 'create', 'interest', 'horror', 'movies', '1930', 'today', 'Great', 'Recession']",Teen Wolf VHS

410224,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,6304263465,Carl Manes,"[3, 3]","From 1985 comes the classic coming-of-age comedy, TEEN WOLF, starring Michael J. Fox! As if homework weren't already hard enough, high school loser Scott Howard starts noticing some odd changes as he is transformed into a teenage werewolf. His enhanced abilities and scary new look quickly make him a star on the court and the most popular kid in school, but as Scott begins to lose himself in ""the animal,"" he must learn that with great power comes great responsibility. Michael J. Fox gives another entertaining performance as Scott Howard, whose shy apprehension prior to his literal and figurative transformation makes him a lovable dork. TEEN WOLF is clearly a product of its time, following strict standards that have been set forth by other teen comedies of the era. Memorable moments like Scott's trip to the liquor store and the van surfing scene have made this a fan favorite for decades, however, and for good reason. Despite the obvious 1980's cliches, the humor is well-written, the lines are perfectly delivered, and the monster make-up used to turn Fox into the wolf couldn't be more suitable to add a soft horror edge.
