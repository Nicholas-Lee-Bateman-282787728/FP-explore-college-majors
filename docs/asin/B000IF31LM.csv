1020130,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000IF31LM,calvinnme,"[6, 6]","This film is the very definition of the word ""droll"", and is one of my favorite comedies. The three residents of Dame Beatrice's rooming house don't really have a place in the world, and Dame Beatrice herself is upset that she isn't able to bring in the kind of money that she once did for all of her favorite charities. They all feel that the world has forgotten them until Lily, Dame Beatrice's maid, steals a mink from the veranda of a man who has tried to give it to his wife to appease her jealousy and his conscience over his extramarital affairs. Since Lily has a criminal record, Beatrice and her tenants are afraid she will be returned to jail, so they all work together to replace the mink without the owners ever noticing it was missing. When they are successful they realize it would probably be just as easy to steal furs as replace stolen ones and use the proceeds for Beatrice's charities. This gives all concerned a purpose in life, which is all they have been seeking. The unlikely team of thieves makes many mistakes, but usually come away with the furs, and only give up the game when Lily discovers what they've been doing and makes them promise not to steal another fur. However, a call to Dame Beatrice from someone seeking further charitable contributions puts them back in action.  However, they can't continue to steal furs due to their promise to Lily. Thus, they turn their attention to even bigger game at the end of the film.This film is a comedy completely without personal conflict - it is pure comedy and farce from beginning to end. All involved work together for the common good, and no selfish motives are ever seen, other than the desire to be useful. You keep waiting for one of the members of the little band of thieves to get greedy and want to keep at least some of the money for themselves, but it never happens. At a time in American cinema history when film noir was still popular, and crime dramas often had no sympathetic characters, it is strange to watch a film from this period in which all of the characters are sympathetic. This probably has to do with the difference between American and British culture, and also the period in British history in which this film was made. The British had just come through a fifteen year period in history after World War II in which they had attempted to remake British society, and in many ways had fallen short of the mark. The gentry felt displaced, but many of the common people didn't feel the inclusion they expected this displacement to achieve. Thus there were several British films from this period, such as ""The Smallest Show on Earth"", in which people banded together to fulfill a common goal that achieved nothing more than an affirmation of their own usefulness. This is one of those films, and I find it not only funny, but completely charming.",5,A film only the British could make,1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,2844,"['film', 'very', 'definition', 'word', 'droll', 'one', 'favorite', 'comedies', 'three', 'residents', 'Dame', 'Beatrice', 'rooming', 'house', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'place', 'world', 'Dame', 'Beatrice', 'upset', ""n't"", 'able', 'bring', 'kind', 'money', 'once', 'did', 'favorite', 'charities', 'feel', 'world', 'forgotten', 'Lily', 'Dame', 'Beatrice', 'maid', 'mink', 'veranda', 'man', 'who', 'tried', 'give', 'wife', 'appease', 'jealousy', 'conscience', 'extramarital', 'affairs', 'Lily', 'criminal', 'record', 'Beatrice', 'tenants', 'are', 'afraid', 'will', 'be', 'returned', 'jail', 'work', 'together', 'replace', 'mink', 'owners', 'ever', 'noticing', 'was', 'missing', 'When', 'are', 'successful', 'realize', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'just', 'easy', 'steal', 'furs', 'replace', 'stolen', 'ones', 'use', 'proceeds', 'Beatrice', 'charities', 'concerned', 'purpose', 'life', 'have', 'been', 'seeking', 'unlikely', 'team', 'thieves', 'many', 'mistakes', 'usually', 'come', 'away', 'furs', 'only', 'give', 'up', 'game', 'when', 'Lily', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'promise', 'not', 'steal', 'fur', 'However', 'call', 'Dame', 'Beatrice', 'someone', 'seeking', 'further', 'charitable', 'contributions', 'back', 'action', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'continue', 'steal', 'furs', 'due', 'promise', 'Lily', 'Thus', 'turn', 'attention', 'even', 'bigger', 'game', 'end', 'film.This', 'film', 'comedy', 'completely', 'personal', 'conflict', 'pure', 'comedy', 'farce', 'beginning', 'end', 'involved', 'work', 'together', 'common', 'good', 'selfish', 'motives', 'are', 'ever', 'seen', 'other', 'desire', 'be', 'useful', 'keep', 'waiting', 'one', 'members', 'little', 'band', 'thieves', 'get', 'greedy', 'want', 'keep', 'least', 'money', 'never', 'time', 'American', 'cinema', 'history', 'when', 'film', 'noir', 'was', 'still', 'popular', 'crime', 'dramas', 'often', 'had', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'strange', 'watch', 'film', 'period', 'characters', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'probably', 'do', 'difference', 'American', 'British', 'culture', 'also', 'period', 'British', 'history', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'British', 'had', 'just', 'come', 'fifteen', 'year', 'period', 'history', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'had', 'attempted', 'remake', 'British', 'society', 'many', 'ways', 'had', 'fallen', 'short', 'mark', 'gentry', 'felt', 'displaced', 'many', 'common', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'inclusion', 'expected', 'displacement', 'achieve', 'Thus', 'were', 'several', 'British', 'films', 'period', 'such', 'Smallest', 'Show', 'Earth', 'people', 'banded', 'together', 'fulfill', 'common', 'goal', 'achieved', 'nothing', 'more', 'affirmation', 'own', 'usefulness', 'one', 'films', 'find', 'not', 'only', 'funny', 'completely', 'charming']",N/A
1020131,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,B000IF31LM,F. S. L'hoir,"[1, 1]","""Make Mine Mink"" is absolutely delightful. I have removed a star only because of the full-screen ratio (4 x 3, according to the box). Any character standing on the side gets cut off, which is a shame. This film needs to be seen in letter-box format, but meanwhile let's thank the Brazilians for giving us this gem of a film in any format whatsoever. Other than this problem, which can be annoying, the transfer is very clear. Do not let the Portuguese cover bother you. The movie is in its original English and the sound-track is excellent.Other than gap-toothed Terry-Thomas and the splendid Athene Seyler, many of these actors come from the zany ""Carry On"" flicks, and they are priceless, especially Hattie Jacques, who plays a hefty, hard-boiled professor of etiquette. ""Make Mine Mink"" is full of references to other movies, such as the ""Third Man."" And I do love the burglar, who insists that he's of the prewar school of larceny, and wouldn't think of doing bodily harm to anyone.This comic heist film still has me laughing out loud.

1020132,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000IF31LM,Kevin Killian,"[5, 5]","Seniors band together improbably to form a ring of fur thieves, in a script without rhyme or reason and yet an ineffable charm fueled by the superb quality of acting on display, and a script which is about half good.  It's sort of like the Alec Guinness Ealing comedies, but sweeter in spirit, and it's sort of like the Carry On movies, right down to the casting, for Kenneth Williams and Hattie Jacques are both here, in fine form, and yet it's not as smutty as the Carry On shows.  In fact it's an adorable anomaly in the career of director Robert Asher, and in 1950s British comedy as a whole.Miss Pinkerton (""Pinky"") strikes me as a completely original comic type.  She works from her room mending other folks' chipped china, a ghastly profession apparently, but Pinky has her pride.  In one great shot, a frazzled Pinky, sure the jig is up, is shown trying to meld a chine teacup to the head of a Louis XIV shepherdess, not even knowing what she's doing.  Her boggle eyes and her limpid blonde locks, cascading around her face like Nigel Tufnel's in THIS IS SPINAL TAP, give her a more contemporary look than some of her flatmates.  Look at the way she walks, it's a lope like a gazelle, as though life were a wonderful gift filled with surprises and she was running to meet it halfway.  What a remarkable creation, and what an astonishing actress--Elspeth Duxbury, and what a tragedy that she only made a few other films and none of them affording her this freedom of invention and sparkle.  Without ""Pinky,"" the dramatis personae of MAKE MINE MINK would seem rather grim, if you ask me, even though each of them is a fine actor--the mannish, meanfaced Hattie Jacques, the acerbic twerp Terry-Thomas, with the harsh gap between his teeth like a vise, Agatha Christie's favorite actress Athene Seyler as Dame Beatrice, and the utterly louche Kenneth Williams incredibly sinister here as Dame Beatrice's slumming nephew.Not to mention the young couple who provide the love interest, Samuel Beckett's favorite actress Billie Whitelaw as Lily, Dame Beatrice's maid and a former convict, trying to go straight; and Jack Hedley as the friendly cop on the beat, Benham, a lawman with a thing for Lily, and a secret all his own.  Hedley, perhaps most familiar to US audiences as Goober in the Olivier/Natalie Wood version of CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF, is another great actor who almost manages to make his traditional part come alive, it's as if he though he were acting in a ""kitchen sink"" sort of drama about the working class, and Billie Whitelaw matches him stroke by stroke.  (There's a strange, intrusive shot of Whitelaw responding to the doorbell from a nap, in her underwear, pulling on a housecoat, it has something of an unpleasant flavor to it, for it seems so exploitative of Whitelaw's body, without adding much to the human comedy of her role.  It's a rip in the fantasy world of the rest of the movie, letting in way too much reality.)If this film doesn't make you a little nutty with glee, you might not be alive.
