Wilson ""SonRisedInTheEast""","[3, 3]","Even the proud proclamaition of ""Oliver Stone presents"" across the top of the DVD wasn't enough to get the masses to check this out... it's a shame too because this is a borderline great(albeit flawed) Thai war epic based on actual historic events.  The story follows the tale of a small Siamese village and it's legendary ability to repeatably withstand the invading Burmese empire.  Although made with a meager budget(especially in comparison to it's American contemporaries), Bang Rajan is able to deliver in most of the areas necessary to make a war movie work.  The battles are filmed well(although the fight at the begining is too dark and shaky for it's own good, thankfully this isn't a continuing trend throughout the rest of the picture) and provides enough cringe worthy moments to keep the ugly realism of war intact(arrows through necks, severed limbs, bashed heads, etc.).  A strong musical score fits nicely too, and really helps propel both the action as well as the more dramatic beats.  Honestly there is only one thing that holds this movie back... character development.  Unfortunately nearly all of the characters are one-dimensional cardboard cutouts(i.e., the drunken warrior, the emotionless leader, the soon-to-be father) who get very little backstory(if any) and are basically the same at the end of the film as they were at their inception(except maybe dead).  Don't get me wrong, you still like the characters, however; it's more because you feel for their plight and that they are shown to be good and honorable people(while the Burmese are portrayed as a souless conquering horde) rather than having any growing ties to them.  There are definite moments that would have been far more poignant with more expansion of the characters.  Another reviewer stated that they felt the acting wasn't up to par, which seems a tad unfair.  The film is subtitled so I would argue the difficulty to judge the acting completely without being able to understand the actual delivery of the dialogue.  The characters are strong and stoic(especially the leader of Bang Rajan, who it should be noted sports a killer mustache!) and are prepared to sacrifice everything for their freedom, and that comes across perfectly I thought.  As Americans we've been spoiled with some truly great and epic war films, Bang Rajan isn't quite on their level BUT it's still a very good film that fans of the genre(and mustaches!) should catch at least once.",4,"Impressive Thai war film that gets extra marks for the lead characters incredible mustache(yeah, you read that right!)",1204848000,"03 7, 2008",2008,2451,"['Even', 'proud', 'proclamaition', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'presents', 'top', 'DVD', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'get', 'masses', 'check', 'out', 'shame', 'too', 'borderline', 'great', 'flawed', 'Thai', 'war', 'epic', 'based', 'actual', 'historic', 'events', 'story', 'tale', 'small', 'Siamese', 'village', 'legendary', 'ability', 'repeatably', 'withstand', 'invading', 'Burmese', 'empire', 'made', 'meager', 'budget', 'especially', 'comparison', 'American', 'contemporaries', 'Bang', 'Rajan', 'able', 'deliver', 'most', 'areas', 'necessary', 'make', 'war', 'movie', 'work', 'battles', 'are', 'filmed', 'well', 'fight', 'begining', 'too', 'dark', 'shaky', 'own', 'good', 'thankfully', ""n't"", 'continuing', 'trend', 'rest', 'picture', 'enough', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'moments', 'keep', 'ugly', 'realism', 'war', 'intact', 'necks', 'severed', 'limbs', 'bashed', 'heads', 'etc.', 'strong', 'musical', 'score', 'fits', 'nicely', 'too', 'really', 'propel', 'action', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'dramatic', 'beats', 'Honestly', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'back', 'character', 'development', 'Unfortunately', 'nearly', 'characters', 'are', 'one-dimensional', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'i.e.', 'drunken', 'warrior', 'emotionless', 'leader', 'soon-to-be', 'father', 'who', 'get', 'very', 'little', 'backstory', 'are', 'basically', 'same', 'end', 'film', 'were', 'inception', 'maybe', 'dead', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'still', 'characters', 'however', 'more', 'feel', 'plight', 'are', 'shown', 'be', 'good', 'honorable', 'people', 'Burmese', 'are', 'portrayed', 'souless', 'conquering', 'horde', 'rather', 'having', 'growing', 'ties', 'are', 'definite', 'moments', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'poignant', 'more', 'expansion', 'characters', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'felt', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'up', 'par', 'tad', 'unfair', 'film', 'subtitled', 'so', 'would', 'argue', 'difficulty', 'judge', 'acting', 'completely', 'being', 'able', 'understand', 'actual', 'delivery', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'are', 'strong', 'stoic', 'especially', 'leader', 'Bang', 'Rajan', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'sports', 'killer', 'mustache', 'are', 'prepared', 'sacrifice', 'everything', 'freedom', 'perfectly', 'thought', 'Americans', ""'ve"", 'been', 'spoiled', 'truly', 'great', 'epic', 'war', 'films', 'Bang', 'Rajan', ""n't"", 'quite', 'level', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'fans', 'genre', 'mustaches', 'should', 'catch', 'least', 'once']",Bang Rajan

941060,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B000BDGWGC,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I believe this is the first Thai film I ever saw and I was pleasantly surprised by it. It is a quite well done historical superproduction about events which really took place and it is an interesting viewing even for those (like me) who have no knowledge of Thai history or Thai civilization. The review which follows contains some limited SPOILERS.If I understood things correctly, the real events which inspired this film took place between August 1765 and January 1766. In this time Thailand was known as the Kingdom of Siam and sometimes also as Ayutthaya, after the name of its capital. The Ayutthaya period in Thai history lasted from 1350 to 1767 and during this time the country expanded its territory and rose to become a major regional power. However beginning in 1548 Ayutthaya kingdom entered in a long term conflict with neigboring Burma and those bloody and costly wars lasted until 1614. After another short war in 1662-64 both sides had enough and agreed on a peace treaty.This peace lasted until 1759, when Ayutthaya imprudently supported an internal rebellion of Mon nation in Burma. In 1759-60 war the Burmese defeated the Siamese and only the sickness and death of their king Alaungpaya stopped them from taking the city of Ayutthaya itself. But in 1765 a new Burmese king, Hsinbyushin, decided to finish the job and invaded Siam with two large armies, advancing towards Ayutthaya from north (beginning its march in August) and south (which left in October). The southern army arrived at Ayutthaya in December 1765 but the norhern one met unexpected trouble and although it was the first to march, at that moment it was still stuck.The first who stopped Burmese northern army were northern feodal lords who had their own troops. Once they were defeated in August-October 1765, the Burmese continued their advance but then they met another foe, which they did not include in their calculations - a local peasant militia, poorly armed but numerous, whose headquarters were in a large northern village Bang Rajan. Siamese peasants were not initially very motivated to fight, but were pushed to their limit by the brutality of advancing Burmese. The invading army was capturing people as slaves and in the process women were raped and old and invalid murdered. Even in places where they were not taking slaves, the Burmese were seizing all the food and taking away the livestock. The Siamese peasants armed themselves with whatever they had and fought back with energy of desperation, with many women joining the men in combat. After winning some small battles by suprising the enemy, the peasant militia became better armed and got more confident and better organised. Completely surprised by this extremely determined foe, the Burmese were stopped in their progress for months.This film is the description of those dramatic months of desperate fight around Bang Rajan, as seen by the leaders of this peasant army. Being an adventure film, ""Bang Rajan"" includes many elements which were probably added later but which so firmly entered the national memory that they couldn't be discarded - and I think it was the right decision, as it embellishes the film. The director kept this film under strict control and mercilessly eliminated unnecessary things - as the result, even if this film lasts 127 minutes I never got bored. For obvious reasons actors were completely unknown to me but I believe they all did a good job.This film permits to discover a pretty unique kind of art of war in use in South-East Asia roughly between 1525 (introduction of European firearms by the Portuguese) and 1825 (first Anglo-Burmese War):- in XVIII century armies of both Siam and Burma were mostly composed of a mass of peasant conscripts serving as light infantry, with the spears, short slashing swords and knives being the only weapons. Those troops wore no armor (and seemingly not even shields) and no uniform. Some infantry troops were made of professionals and they would be armed at least partially with muskets (no bayonets though) and would wear some kind of uniform and at least a light helmet. Some infantrymen would also use bows and arrows or crossbows, but in XVIII century those weapons were being more and more replaced with firearms.- mounted troops were not very numerous and composed mostly of nobles, who could afford a horse. They fought mostly with bows or muskets and lances, with some wealthier men carrying also a pistol or two and wearing some kind of armor. War elephants played still a role, as generals rode them frequently into battle and they also carried turrets with some sharpshooters with muskets inside. Finally artillery also played an important role, woth both light field cannons and heavy siege guns being used.Amongst the things which surprised me was women's haircut style - they all had their hair cut really short and in an unusual and rather unattractive way. As the result, if you want to look at some Asian beauties, were, you will have to watch another film... Also, in fighting scenes, I couldn't help but wonder, why almost nobody was using shields? Even a bamboo or wicker shield is better than nothing in a fight where almost everybody uses slashing weapons - and they are not so hard to make.On another hand, what I really appreciated was that martial arts were virtually absent. That was a good decision by the director, considering that if martial arts are very useful as sport and a way to perfect ourselves, they have virtually not use on the real battlefield.Finally, without willing to say too much, I must just warn you, that this film is not only pretty violent but also quite tragic. This is an epic tale, but definitely not a ""feel good"" one...So bottom line, this is a good, solid, interesting adventure/war movie, dramatic, tragic and pretty moving, especially towards the end. I am keeping my DVD for a rewatch one day.

941065,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B000BDGWGC,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[1, 1]","This film is based on actual events from the history of the Thai people. It occurred in 1767 when the ever encroaching Burmese made a pro longed invasion of their neighbour Siam. They raided the locals and demanded among other things the surrender of all unmarried girls. This led some villagers to attack the Burmese. They retaliated and things spiralled from there.In the film it gets straight into the fighting and then leaves character and to some extent plot development till after we have had some gore. That may sound like a criticism, but actually it was quite good to get a taste of the action up front. The fighting is dubbed, which is a pity, like old martial arts films are; you know the sort where they punch a gloved hand to indicate a punch on flesh. That was a bit poor, but a lot of attention has gone into the fights and no cgi.It is up to the people of this lone village to stand against the Burmese aggressor and they ruddy well  did, this is their story.The characters are developed only in so far as to let us know their basic character, good, brave, drunkard etc. This has often led critics to accuse Asian cinema of being `childish', but that is really cultural imperialism, as that is how some people are.The villagers have a Buddhist Priest who they put great faith in, and a newly elected leader Nai Chen Nuad Kheo (with a huge moustache!) ; he takes over after their chief is wounded fighting the invaders. He then sets about organising a defence and prepare for a siege. The authorities in the capital Ayutthaya, offer no help - which came as a blow and is actually true.This film cost a fortune to make, but made a bigger one back, it got limited screenings outside of Asia, but did see the light of day in America being presented by Oliver Stone. It is one for those who like a bit of history, lots of fighting and plenty of action. I really enjoyed it, it is also quite accurate on the historical front (including the fighting water buffalo) and they have an honest ending.
