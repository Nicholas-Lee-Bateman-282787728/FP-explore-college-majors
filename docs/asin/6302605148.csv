322697,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6302605148,Dr. James Gardner,"[5, 5]","When ""China Seas"" achieved such success in 1936 by offering MGM's 3 top stars (Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, and Wallace Beery), MGM decided to try their luck again, replacing Wallace Beery with Lionel Barrymore.From 1932 through 1936 these 3 actors (along with Beery and Garbo) dominated the top 10 every year. Gable and Harlow together in ""Red Dust"" (1932), ""Hold Your Man"" (1933), ""China Seas"" (1935), and ""Wife vs. Secretary"" (1936), Harlow in ""Red Headed Woman"" (1932  and ""Libeled Lady"" (1936), Gable in ""It Happened One Night"" (1934), ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935), and ""San Francisco"" (1936), and Barrymore in ""Grand Hotel"" (1932), with Harlow in ""Dinner at Eight"" (1933) and ""The Girl from Missouri"" (1934), and in ""Camille"" (1936). This was a powerhouse, and the success of ""China Seas"" meant it would be a profitable powerhouse.Of course, Gable + Harlow by themselves were a tremendous draw. Of the 6 films they did together, only their first, ""The Secret Six"" (1931), failed to reach the top 10.Clark Gable (1901-60) was one of the biggest stars of the 20th century, and a pretty good actor to boot. He's best remembered as Rhett Butler for ""GWTW"" (1939), for which he received one of his three Oscar nominations:  the others were for ""It Happened One Night"" (1934) and ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935). My favorite Gable flick is ""Run Silent Run Deep"" (1958). Gable plays a kind hearted bookieJean Harlow (1911-37) plays Barrymore's granddaughter who is engaged to a wealthy man (Walter Pigeon).  Harlow was the biggest sex symbol of her times, but she evolved as an actress, exploring different personas, such as the comedienne (""Bombshell""), the brassy girl friend (""Red Dust""), and the girl next door (""Wife vs. Secretary"").  This was Harlow's last film, and she died during production. Given how much improvement she was making year over year, there's no telling how wonderful an actress she would have become.The great Lionel Barrymore (1878-1954) appeared in more than 200 films between 1908 and 1956, and was twice nominated for an Oscar, winning once (""A Free Soul"") in 1931. Though he's probably best known as the evil banker in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946) and from his recurring roles in the Dr. Kildare/Gillespie films, he gave us many memorable performances - as the innkeeper in ""Key Largo"" (1948), Grandpa in ""You Can't Take it With You"" (1938), and Billy Bones in ""Treasure Island"" (1934). Barrymore plays Harlow's grandpa.Walter Pigeon (1897-1984) appeared in more than 100 films between 1926 and 1978. He's best known for his Oscar nominated performances in ""Mrs. Miniver"" (1943) and ""Madame Curie"" (1944), although I liked him best as Dr. Morbius from ""The Forbidden Planet"" (1956). Pigeon's philosophy was - ""Maybe it was better never to become red hot. I'd seen performers like that and they never lasted long."" Pigeon plays Harlow's wealthy fianc&eacute;.Una Merkel and Frank Morgan worked with Harlow on ""Bombshell"" (1933) and show up here.Una Merkel (1903-1986) appeared in nearly 100 films and was nominated as Best Supporting Actress in 1961 (""Summer and Smoke""). She's best remembered for the hair pulling fight with Marlene Dietrich in ""Destry Rides Again"" (1939). She gets a chance to sing, along with (believe it or not) Clark Gable and Hattie McDaniel.Frank Morgan (1890-1949) will forever be remembered as the ""Wizard of Oz"" (1939) but this was only 1 of nearly 100 film performances between 1916 and 1950, including Oscar nominations for ""The Affairs of Cellini"" (1934) and ""Tortilla Flat"" (1942). He plays Merkel's husband. (BTW - mid way through the film he plays a scene on a train with Margaret Hamilton, who would join him 2 years later as The Wicked Witch of the East.)Hattie McDaniel (1895-1952) had an uncredited role as Harlow's maid in ""China Seas"" but managed to get listed for this one. She once said - ""I'd rather play a maid than be one."" She's best known for her Oscar winning role as Mammy in ""GWTW"" (1939), one of more than 300 roles she played in a career from 1932 to 1952. I remember her best from her TV series ""Beulah"" (1952). McDaniel and Gable were good friends, and she appeared in several films with Harlow and Gable.Jack Conway (1887-1952) directs. Conway was a prolific director (over 100 films) who started out as an actor but decided directing was for him when he was asked to wrestle a lion. He directed MGM's first talkie in 1928 (""Alias Jimmy Valentine"") and worked on ""Birth of a Nation"" (1915) as a second director. He was one of the few directors who could keep up the action in a film that lasted more than 2 hours (e.g., ""A Tale of Two Cities"", ""Viva Villa"", and ""Northwest Passage""). In the 30s, Conway was doing 3 to 4 films a year.""Saratoga"" was the #2 box office film for 1937, beaten only by ""Snow White."" The top films were ""Topper"", ""Wee Willie Winkie"" and ""Stella Dallas"". Harlow's ""Personal Property"" was #15 that year. The Oscars went to ""Emile Zola"" (Picture), ""The Awful Truth"" (Director), ""Captains Courageous"" (Actor), and ""The Good Earth"" (Actress). Clark Gable and Myrna Loy were voted the King and Queen of Hollywood.The film had two major disasters - Harlow's death and Barrymore's broken hip. Harlow's few unfinished scenes were shot using a stand in and filmed from the back, or wearing a large hat, or covering her face with binoculars. This was the last film in which Barrymore appeared without the wheelchair, and you can see near the end of the film he is having a lot of problems walking.If you like Gable and Harlow, this is the film for you. Their performances are not as good as they were in ""China Seas"" nor ""Wife vs. Secretary"", partly as a problem with the story, but also because Harlow was trying to stretch her acting skills once more. But what the heck. Gable sings and Harlow smokes a cigar. What more can you ask for?",4,Harlow's last film,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,5833,"['When', 'China', 'Seas', 'achieved', 'such', 'success', '1936', 'offering', 'MGM', '3', 'top', 'stars', 'Clark',

322698,AW8V0C2LO6NFX,6302605148,Jeffrey E. Ford,"[34, 36]","The gloom of Jean Harlow's tragic early death has cast a pall over SARATOGA for over 65 years.  It's time for that veil to be lifted.  Taken as it stands, SARATOGA is a gem of a romantic comedy with great performances from both Harlow and Clark Gable. Even the infamous doubling for Harlow in the last third doesn't mar the film, as it's handled in such a straightforward and perfunctory manner.  What the film might have been had Harlow lived to complete it is debatable; even a notorious critic like Graham Greene thought the film played better downplaying the leading lady's role towards the end.  What has always struck me is how some Harlow fans bemoan the doubling, and even the fact the film was completed.  Would they have preferred MGM to scrap the over forty minutes of footage that Harlow did leave prior to her death?  If the studio had done that, I tend to think that they would be the one's crying over the loss now.  I, for one, would much prefer having the prime Harlow footage that appears here, more then any of her other, rather awful work in films like HELL'S ANGELS, PLATINUM BLONDE, and PUBLIC ENEMY.  As for the 3 and  minutes that Mary Dees spends in the film with her back to the camera, or wearing that ridiculous floppy hat (in the one scene I think could have been omitted), how many remember Harlow's early appearance in the Clara Bow film THE SATURDAY NIGHT KID, where she spent nearly twice that amount of time with her own back to the camera.  Even in Harlow's previous film, PERSONAL PROPERTY, the back of her head ended up facing the camera more than a few times.  The bottom line is that people only complain about the doubling in SARATOGA because their attention is drawn to it, unfortunately due to the sad circumstances regarding the film's production.  However, once the film is separated from it's tragic history, it becomes the grand entertainment it was intended to be.  The script by Anita Loos and Robert Hopkins is exemplary, and the performances all around hit just the right, lighthearted, note (again, all the more impressive given the history).  For me, SARATOGA has become a test case.  I've shown it to over two dozen people over the years, and all of them, having no idea of it's history, thought it was marvelous.  Nor did they pick up on the Mary Dees doubling, or even have any idea there was anything wrong with Jean Harlow.  All were shocked when I revealed she had died before completing the film.  After all these years, it's time for the mourning to end.  In 1937 Time magazine boldly declared that SARATOGA was ""Jean Harlow's best film, as well as her last.""  I won't go that far.  But among the Gable/Harlow films, I will say it ranks second only to RED DUST.  Hopefully, when the film makes it's way to DVD it will get the deluxe treatment it deserves - both for its unique history, and as a memorial to its wonderful leading lady.",5,Forget the sad history; it's a sparkling star vehicle,1021420800,"05 15, 2002",2002,2894,"['gloom', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'tragic', 'early', 'death', 'cast', 'pall', 'SARATOGA', '65', 'years', 'time', 'veil', 'be', 'lifted', 'Taken', 'SARATOGA', 'gem', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'great', 'performances', 'Harlow', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Even', 'infamous', 'doubling', 'Harlow', 'last', 'third', ""n't"", 'mar', 'film', 'handled', 'such', 'straightforward', 'perfunctory', 'manner', 'What', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'Harlow', 'lived', 'complete', 'debatable', 'even', 'notorious', 'critic', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'thought', 'film', 'played', 'better', 'downplaying', 'leading', 'lady', 'role', 'end', 'What', 'always', 'struck', 'how', 'Harlow', 'fans', 'bemoan', 'doubling', 'even', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'completed', 'Would', 'have', 'preferred', 'MGM', 'scrap', 'forty', 'minutes', 'footage', 'Harlow', 'did', 'leave', 'prior', 'death', 'studio', 'had', 'done', 'tend', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'crying', 'loss', 'now', 'one', 'would', 'much', 'prefer', 'having', 'prime', 'Harlow', 'footage', 'here', 'more', 'then', 'other', 'rather', 'awful', 'work', 'films', 'HELL', 'ANGELS', 'PLATINUM', 'BLONDE', 'PUBLIC', 'ENEMY', '3', 'minutes', 'Mary', 'Dees', 'film', 'back', 'camera', 'wearing', 'ridiculous', 'floppy', 'hat', 'one', 'scene', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'omitted', 'how', 'many', 'remember', 'Harlow', 'early', 'appearance', 'Clara', 'Bow', 'film', 'THE', 'SATURDAY', 'NIGHT', 'KID', 'where', 'spent', 'nearly', 'twice', 'amount', 'time', 'own', 'back', 'camera', 'Even', 'Harlow', 'previous', 'film', 'PERSONAL', 'PROPERTY', 'back', 'head', 'ended', 'up', 'facing', 'camera', 'more', 'few', 'times', 'bottom', 'line', 'people', 'only', 'complain', 'doubling', 'SARATOGA', 'attention', 'drawn', 'unfortunately', 'due', 'sad', 'circumstances', 'regarding', 'film', 'production', 'However', 'once', 'film', 'separated', 'tragic', 'history', 'grand', 'entertainment', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'script', 'Anita', 'Loos', 'Robert', 'Hopkins', 'exemplary', 'performances', 'hit', 'just', 'right', 'lighthearted', 'note', 'again', 'more', 'impressive', 'given', 'history', 'SARATOGA', 'become', 'test', 'case', ""'ve"", 'shown', 'two', 'dozen', 'people', 'years', 'having', 'idea', 'history', 'thought', 'was', 'marvelous', 'did', 'pick', 'up', 'Mary', 'Dees', 'doubling', 'even', 'have', 'idea', 'there', 'was', 'anything', 'wrong', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'were', 'shocked', 'when', 'revealed', 'had', 'died', 'completing', 'film', 'years', 'time', 'mourning', 'end', '1937', 'Time', 'magazine', 'boldly', 'declared', 'SARATOGA', 'was', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'best', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'last', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'Gable/Harlow', 'films', 'will', 'say', 'second', 'only', 'RED', 'DUST', 'Hopefully', 'when', 'film', 'way', 'DVD', 'will', 'get', 'deluxe', 'treatment', 'unique', 'history', 'memorial', 'wonderful', 'leading', 'lady']",N/A

Curious to see how that was handled, I rented the movie myself. As comedies from the 30s go, it's okay; not the best work I've seen, but not the worst either. Jean is noticeably fuller figured here than in anything else I'd ever seen her in (&quot;Red Dust&quot;, &quot;Wife vs. Secretary&quot;); I suppose it sounds vapid to say, but I think she looked better bodywise than when she was thinner--vapid, because it was her kidney failure that was causing her to retain fluid in her tissues. It's disturbing afterwards to think that here's actual footage of someone dying right before our eyes, and that nobody could pick up on it at the time. As the movie began to move towards its end, I noticed that there were no more shots of Jean's face, that her back was to the camera the whole time. Obviously, these are the shots filmed after her death, when they had to have a body double stand in for her so that the other stars had SOMEBODY to say their lines too, and act around.If you too are curious to see how MGM dealt with such a serious production problem, then check out &quot;Saratoga&quot;, but personally, I find it too sad to see again, regardless of its being a comedy.",3,Harlow's Swan Song,1006732800,"11 26, 2001",2001,1477,"['other', 'reviewer', 'great', 'deal', 'detail', 'movie', 'need', 'recap', 'quot', 'Saratoga', 'quot', 'indeed', 'famous', 'was', 'movie', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'was', 'making', 'time', 'was', 'striken', 'nephritis', 'died', 'leaving', 'own', 'part', 'show', 'unfinished', 'Curious', 'see', 'how', 'was', 'handled', 'rented', 'movie', 'comedies', '30s', 'go', 'okay', 'not', 'best', 'work', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'not', 'worst', 'Jean', 'noticeably', 'fuller', 'figured', 'here', 'anything', 'else', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'quot', 'Red', 'Dust', 'quot', 'quot', 'Wife', 'Secretary', 'quot', 'suppose', 'vapid', 'say', 'think', 'looked', 'better', 'bodywise', 'when', 'was', 'thinner', 'vapid', 'was', 'kidney', 'failure', 'was', 'causing', 'retain', 'fluid', 'tissues', 'disturbing', 'afterwards', 'think', 'here', 'actual', 'footage', 'someone', 'dying', 'right', 'eyes', 'nobody', 'could', 'pick', 'up', 'time', 'movie', 'began', 'move', 'towards', 'end', 'noticed', 'were', 'more', 'shots', 'Jean', 'face', 'back', 'was', 'camera', 'whole', 'time', 'Obviously', 'are', 'shots', 'filmed', 'death', 'when', 'had', 'have', 'body', 'double', 'stand', 'so', 'other', 'stars', 'had', 'SOMEBODY', 'say', 'lines', 'too', 'act', 'around.If', 'too', 'are', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'MGM', 'serious', 'production', 'problem', 'then', 'check', 'out', 'quot', 'Saratoga', 'quot', 'personally', 'find', 'too', 'sad', 'see', 'again', 'regardless', 'being', 'comedy']",N/A

Their trip to Oz was only a few years away.Watching Harlow is a good ""bet"" too due to some eerie lines (Goodbye and I could just die) so this makes Saratoga a curio in itself.

322704,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6302605148,Simon Davis,"[8, 9]","I really think it is hard to talk about ""Saratoga"" divorced from all the sadness of what occured during the making of the film. Whatever artistic merits the film possesses, the dark cloud of Jean Harlow's tragic death a little while before production was completed hangs over this film. Forever viewers will be looking to see which scenes actress Mary Dees filled in for Jean under a large floppy hat or behind a set of binoculars. I know even without thinking I still do now even after a few viewings of my copy of the film.In a way I still find myself hoping that Jean Harlow will somehow complete all her scenes and thus finish the film.Although I find the film a very pleasing comedy romance with a fine performance from Clark Gable and two of my favorite character people in the great Hattie McDaniel and George Zucco I still find it disturbing as Harlow is obviously very unwell from the first scene in the movie. Despite this she delivers a spirited performance which I think is among her best, not of course up to ""Bombshell"" or ""Dinner at Eight"" standards but nevertheless a good one.The film runs for about 63 minutes before Jeans first replacement scene with Mary Dees takes place which proves that production was almost complete when she fell ill. Jean looks puffy and very tired in most of the scenes she appears in and it is easy to see that something was terribly wrong.Jean Harlow's death from Urinic poisoning at age 26 shocked the whole of Hollywood and her fans as she was far from being the brassy strumpet she so often played on screen but was a decent and caring individual who was greatly loved by the MGM production crews and her frequent co stars like Clark Gable and  Myrna Loy.Despite its morbid quality it is a greatly enjoyable story to watch. Lionel Barrymore playing Jean's relative delivers his usual amusingly crusty performance as the aging horse trainer and Jack Conway's rapid direction keeps the production moving at lighting pace.The film has all the usual MGM attention to detail with great care going into sets, costumnes and choice of performers.I really think ""Saratoga"" is a fine film on its own merits but it can't be watched without the focus being on the tragic death of its leading lady. Most of the occasions in the last 20 minutes of the film where Jean has been replaced are done tastefully and with great care so the end production is a fitting tribute to one of the greatest MGM performers of the 1930""s.
