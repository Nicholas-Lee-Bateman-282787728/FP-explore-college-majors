1422691,A3LWK86I8UV25C,B004O2B0HW,"EllaRooJunebug ""EllaRooJunebug""","[0, 0]","I love Jim Belushi and Kyle Gallner in this! Sarah Hyland & Denise Richards on the other hand are really obnoxious characters. Sarah plays the love interest of Kyle. He gets stood up by her one night, and he ends up in bed with an older woman. She feels bad about his situation (his mom can't pay his tuition anymore), thinks he's a nice kid so in the morning he finds a check for $500. Easy money of course. He tells his buddies and ends up calling her again asking if she has any friends that would be interested in paying for sex with his friends. It end up going down, they throw parties in hotels, have sex, go home, then do it again. Of course all things too good to be true come to an end. Things start to unravel, the people involved get caught, some get hurt but in the end things end up okay. Not a bad movie really. Everyone has different taste, I like stories with fun twists and that aren't afraid to be provocative. The movie definitely isn't the best, I mean come on it has Denise Richards, I'm not a fan in the slightest.

Kyle Gallner plays Sam, a high school boy whose mom was a former playmate. He is a self describe victim of circumstance as he has been kicked out of multiple boarding schools. He finally finds one where it seems he can finish his education only to find out that the money has run out. He goes to a bar and meets  Alison (Kathyrn Morris) whose husband cheats on her. He flatters her and the next thing you know they are in a motel room. The next day she leaves a note and a check. He mentions this to his new friends who suggest they start a ""risky business"" as teen boys for cougars.The guys go on-line to meet more cougars in need and bring in more boys for a business that lasts for about a music montage. Sam has met a girl his own age and wants to end his relationship with ""Mrs. Robinson.""Jim Belushi plays the overly cool school master who says, ""Woman: What do you need to know about them? You tell the good looking ones they're smart and the smart ones they're good looking.""Sex, nudity (not Denise Richards), and Denise Richards' potty mouth.",4,SO WHAT'S YOUR REAL STORY SAMUEL,1304208000,"05 1, 2011",2011,1255,"['can', 'get', 'passed', 'idea', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'as', 'hot', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'someone', 'set', 'up', 'young', 'boys', 'sex', 'might', 'enjoy', 'film', 'oh', 'yes', 'willing', 'pay', 'too', 'Kyle', 'Gallner', 'Sam', 'high', 'school', 'boy', 'mom', 'was', 'former', 'playmate', 'self', 'describe', 'victim', 'circumstance', 'been', 'kicked', 'multiple', 'boarding', 'schools', 'finally', 'one', 'where', 'can', 'finish', 'education', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'money', 'run', 'out', 'bar', 'meets', 'Alison', 'Kathyrn', 'Morris', 'husband', 'cheats', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'are', 'motel', 'room', 'next', 'day', 'note', 'check', 'new', 'friends', 'who', 'suggest', 'start', 'risky', 'business', 'teen', 'boys', 'cougars.The', 'guys', 'go', 'on-line', 'meet', 'more', 'cougars', 'need', 'bring', 'more', 'boys', 'business', 'music', 'montage', 'Sam', 'met', 'girl', 'own', 'age', 'end', 'relationship', 'Mrs', 'Robinson', 'Jim', 'Belushi', 'overly', 'cool', 'school', 'master', 'who', 'Woman', 'What', 'do', 'need', 'know', 'tell', 'good', 'looking', 'ones', ""'re"", 'smart', 'smart', 'ones', ""'re"", 'good', 'looking', 'Sex', 'nudity', 'not', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'potty', 'mouth']",N/A
