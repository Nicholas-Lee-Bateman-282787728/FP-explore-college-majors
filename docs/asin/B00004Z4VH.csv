561196,ATRUKHR9SPZMR,B00004Z4VH,Capt. Freaky,"[8, 9]","I review concerts and erotic films....sometimes I review normal films too...But I happen to know a quality show when I see one on DVD...and this was not one!  I love the music of Mr. Womack and have many of his original records...and CD's.That being said....I expected so much more from this live show recorded off of BET televison.  This was not one of his best perfomances I am sure.  I was disappointed by his lack of professionalism performing some of his biggest hit songs.Most people go to see a live show to hear the songs (in basic form) the original way an artist once recorded it.  Performers like the Eagles, Boz Scaggs, Tom Jones, Luther Vandross to name a few...deliver on that important performing aspect sounding like the ""original version"".  Mr. Womack did a poor job of making me believe he wanted to be there singing that night....he seemed to rather sit down and chat with the audience about his long career...instead of concentrating on singing really well.  His voice cut out on him many times and sounded powerless....he butchured much of his best material.The sound quality of this DVD was just average as well....I was highly disappointed by it for many reasons....you may be too!",2,Did I watch something these other folks didn't here?,1141948800,"03 10, 2006",2006,1204,"['review', 'concerts', 'erotic', 'films', 'review', 'normal', 'films', 'too', 'happen', 'know', 'quality', 'show', 'when', 'see', 'one', 'DVD', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'love', 'music', 'Mr.', 'Womack', 'have', 'many', 'original', 'records', ""CD's.That"", 'being', 'said', '.I', 'expected', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'live', 'show', 'recorded', 'BET', 'televison', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'perfomances', 'am', 'sure', 'was', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'professionalism', 'performing', 'biggest', 'hit', 'songs.Most', 'people', 'go', 'see', 'live', 'show', 'hear', 'songs', 'basic', 'form', 'original', 'way', 'artist', 'once', 'recorded', 'Performers', 'Eagles', 'Boz', 'Scaggs', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'Luther', 'Vandross', 'name', 'few', 'deliver', 'important', 'performing', 'aspect', 'sounding', 'original', 'version', 'Mr.', 'Womack', 'did', 'poor', 'job', 'making', 'believe', 'wanted', 'be', 'there', 'singing', 'night', '.he', 'seemed', 'rather', 'sit', 'down', 'chat', 'audience', 'long', 'career', 'instead', 'concentrating', 'singing', 'really', 'well', 'voice', 'cut', 'out', 'many', 'times', 'sounded', 'powerless', '.he', 'butchured', 'much', 'best', 'material.The', 'sound', 'quality', 'DVD', 'was', 'just', 'average', 'as', 'well', '.I', 'was', 'highly', 'disappointed', 'many', 'reasons', '.you', 'may', 'be', 'too']",The Jazz Channel Presents Bobby Womack
561197,AQLKBEVHUQ0JK,B00004Z4VH,"Eddie Landsberg ""My 10th year as a reviewer !...","[9, 9]","Bobby Womack can definitely be said to be an American original.  An old school soul singer/songwriter who practically invented his own school...  There are no cliches in his music... Bobby Womack *is* Bobby Womack... and its all for the better. - -  What's amazing about this DVD is that he performs and sings the songs as if they were written yesterday... His voice hasn't changed a bit...  He's looking great too... pretty amazing when you realize this guy started out working for Sam Cooke during the golden age of soul...  Aside from his ability to write memorable hits, when you think of all this guys peers, and how few of them are still on the planet... its almost as if this guy is a gift to the world from the fountain of youth... And the great thing about this DVD :  his energy and vibrance still show him to be the star that he is... plus he has no shame in playing the tunes the people want to hear.  All in all... even though this video wasn't made &quot;back in the day&quot;, its still a rare gem.  - - At my bar here in Tokyo, I can't tell you how many customers demand I put it on the player every time they come in... and believe me, I have no complaints about that whatsoever !",5,Mandatory Viewing Assignment ! ! !

First of all, Bobby acted like he was so tired of his own material that he didn't even feel like performing any it.  As a matter-of-fact, he preferred to talk to the audience for at least half of most of the songs he half performed, singing only three or four versus from a song.  His vocal performance of course was not optimal, however considering his age it was acceptable, if he had only elected to sing the songs rather than talk through them.  If I had paid for a ticket, I would request a refund.  Don't waste your time or your money on this concert, unless you are so much of a Bobby Womack diehard fan that you really don't care whether he sings or not.  In that case, perhaps you will enjoy his self-indulgent conversation throughout the concert.",1,Very Poor Performance!,1255651200,"10 16, 2009",2009,876,"['have', 'been', 'Bobby', 'Womack', 'fan', '1970s', 'unfortunately', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'worst', 'performances', 'First', 'Bobby', 'acted', 'was', 'so', 'tired', 'own', 'material', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'feel', 'performing', 'matter-of-fact', 'preferred', 'talk', 'audience', 'least', 'half', 'most', 'songs', 'half', 'performed', 'singing', 'only', 'three', 'four', 'versus', 'song', 'vocal', 'performance', 'course', 'was', 'not', 'optimal', 'however', 'considering', 'age', 'was', 'acceptable', 'had', 'only', 'elected', 'sing', 'songs', 'rather', 'talk', 'had', 'paid', 'ticket', 'would', 'request', 'refund', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'concert', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'Bobby', 'Womack', 'diehard', 'fan', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'not', 'case', 'perhaps', 'will', 'enjoy', 'self-indulgent', 'conversation', 'concert']",The Jazz Channel Presents Bobby Womack
