1126492,ACTS6G5MMQMY5,B0010VDYKG,"Angel F. Kincaid ""angel""","[1, 1]","Hey there,I got this movie several weeks ago due to the fact that I am an avid barbie collector and dealer. I thought it would be a good idea to know the back ground material of the dolls that I'm selling.So like all of the Fairytopia movies before it, this is a movie about finding and celebrating some quality in your self.In this case our star is a pretty dark pink butterfly fairy named Mariposa. She's a bit of a bookworm, and is more comfortable with her books than with people. She has a good friend, and works for the""popular"" girls. She however feels that she doesn't really have a place in this world of her own.She meets the handsome prince, who immdeately deines his royalty wanting her to like him for him self, not his title. Both being bookish they hit it off almost instantly.Fast forward to the next day when the queen is in danger. The prince tells our lovely heroine that shes the only one with the guts to go out into the rest of the world and do what she needs to in order to put things right.The in crowd girls that she works for try to take over, but when they loose the directions turn out to be completely helpless. Demonstrating that all the time she spent with her nose in a book was more valuable than any one gave her credit for, Mariposa is able to help the girls and find the way to the cure for the endangered queen.Over all this story is a bit different from the other Fairytopia tales.I think its geared toward a slightly older crowd, both the toys and the story. Possibly six to seven year olds instead of four to five.It's pretty dramatic and there are some slightly scary parts to it. However it does focus on the main point of the story. That the herione is NOT a helpless damsel waiting for her white knight to ride in on a horse and  save her.It is in fact the girls that spring the prince from the pokey so he can help THEM.It shows that you don't have to be the in crowd, or the popular girls, to make a differnance in your world. Just being your self and giving value to who and what you are is more than enough to make you special, to make a differance.In the end of the story, Mariposa is rewarded for her faith in her self. Given a gift so that no one will ever again not see what a special person she is.And tho we all dont get giant sparkly wings to show the rest of the world how special we are in real life, we do get the confidence and pride to know that we don't have to be anything other than who and what we are.So despite the drama, and the suspsense. I think this is a good movie for young girls. It shows that you dont have to fit in to be something great. Indeed it does convey the message, ""The most beautiful thing you can be, Is your self.""",5,"Good Movie, Good Message",1236124800,"03 4, 2009",2009,2701,"['Hey', 'got', 'movie', 'several', 'weeks', 'ago', 'due', 'fact', 'am', 'avid', 'barbie', 'collector', 'dealer', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'know', 'back', 'ground', 'material', 'dolls', ""'m"", 'selling.So', 'Fairytopia', 'movies', 'movie', 'finding', 'celebrating', 'quality', 'self.In', 'case', 'star', 'pretty', 'dark', 'pink', 'butterfly', 'fairy', 'named', 'Mariposa', 'bit', 'bookworm', 'more', 'comfortable', 'books', 'people', 'good', 'friend', 'popular', 'girls', 'however', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'place', 'world', 'own.She', 'handsome', 'prince', 'who', 'immdeately', 'royalty', 'wanting', 'like', 'not', 'title', 'being', 'bookish', 'hit', 'off', 'almost', 'instantly.Fast', 'forward', 'next', 'day', 'when', 'queen', 'danger', 'prince', 'lovely', 'heroine', 'only', 'one', 'guts', 'go', 'out', 'rest', 'world', 'do', 'what', 'order', 'put', 'things', 'right.The', 'crowd', 'girls', 'try', 'take', 'over', 'when', 'loose', 'directions', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'completely', 'helpless', 'Demonstrating', 'time', 'spent', 'nose', 'book', 'was', 'more', 'valuable', 'one', 'gave', 'credit', 'Mariposa', 'able', 'help', 'girls', 'find', 'way', 'cure', 'endangered', 'queen.Over', 'story', 'bit', 'different', 'other', 'Fairytopia', 'tales.I', 'think', 'geared', 'slightly', 'older', 'crowd', 'toys', 'story', 'Possibly', 'six', 'seven', 'year', 'olds', 'instead', 'four', 'five.It', 'pretty', 'dramatic', 'are', 'slightly', 'scary', 'parts', 'However', 'focus', 'main', 'point', 'story', 'herione', 'NOT', 'helpless', 'damsel', 'waiting', 'white', 'knight', 'ride', 'horse', 'save', 'her.It', 'fact', 'girls', 'spring', 'prince', 'pokey', 'can', 'help', 'THEM.It', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'crowd', 'popular', 'girls', 'make', 'differnance', 'world', 'Just', 'being', 'self', 'giving', 'value', 'who', 'what', 'are', 'more', 'enough', 'make', 'special', 'make', 'differance.In', 'end', 'story', 'Mariposa', 'rewarded', 'faith', 'self', 'Given', 'gift', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'again', 'not', 'see', 'what', 'special', 'person', 'tho', 'dont', 'get', 'giant', 'sparkly', 'wings', 'show', 'rest', 'world', 'how', 'special', 'are', 'real', 'life', 'do', 'get', 'confidence', 'pride', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'anything', 'other', 'who', 'what', 'are.So', 'drama', 'suspsense', 'think', 'good', 'movie', 'young', 'girls', 'dont', 'have', 'fit', 'be', 'something', 'great', 'Indeed', 'convey', 'message', 'most', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'self']",N/A

1126501,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B0010VDYKG,Marshall Lord,"[1, 1]","This fourth offering in Mattel's series of ""Fairytopia"" Barbie films continues the trend towards ever more beautiful animation, has a very similar plot, and introduces a new heroine. As with every previous ""Barbie"" video, my six year old daughter absolutely loves it and has watched it many times. As he has now reached the age where he doesn't think he's supposed to enjoy ""girlie"" things, her twin brother pretends not to like it, but he seems to find his way into the family TV room and sit down to watch a remarkably high proportion of the time when this film is playing.For reference, this is the fourth in the ""Fairytopia"" sequence which currently consists of:FairytopiaMermaidiaMagic of the Rainbow.Mariposa and her Butterfly fairy friendsThe film is bookended by Elena, the heroine of the first three ""Fairytopia"" films, who is telling her puffball companion Bibble the story of her friend Mariposa and how she had the courage both to overcome a threat to the fairy realm and persuade other fairies who at first did not take her seriously to do so.As with all the Barbie films, the story is relentlessly positive and aims to encourage the viewer to strive to achieve everything she is capable of. To a greater extent than some, Mariposa also has a number of second level jokes designed to provide some amusement to mums and dads who are watching the film with their daughters.Before we first rented one of the Barbie videos for my daughter, I was expecting them to be trite, over-commercialised, over-sugary and over here. In general, however, I have been pleasantly surprised.Yes, they do have a lot of commercial spin-offs and a high saccharine count, but the quality of the Barbie films we have subsequently bought or rented, including all four ""Fairytopia"" films, was significantly higher than I had originally expected before watching any of them. These films have not just kept my children engrossed for hours - including my son as well as my daughter - but introduced them to some beautiful stories. Several - but sadly not this one - also introduced my children to some truly wonderful music.On more than one occasion I have been listening to a CD of a classic such as Beethoven's pastoral symphony, or ""The Queen of the Night's aria"" from Mozart's opera ""The Magic Flute"", and little girl has recognised and expressed appreciation of the music, and correctly remembered which Barbie film had used it. (""Magic of Pegasus"" and ""Mermaidia"" respectively.)I was a little disappointed that the last three of four Barbie films, including ""Mariposa"" did not continue this tradition: no great classics this time. This film introduces a new composer: musical scores for all the previous Barbie films had been written by Arnie Roth, who was brilliant at arranging the classics and who ranged from competent to good as a composer in his own right. Music for ""Mariposa and her butterfly fairy friends"" was written by Eric Colvin: it doesn't come up to the standards of Mozart, Mendelsohn or Beethoven as adapted by Arnie Roth, but is nevertheless quite easy on the ear.The animation and backgrounds are quite stunningly beautiful: the last few Barbie films seem to get more visually beautiful each time and tbhis one continues that tradition.There are a few extras on the DVD including some games involving dressing fairies for a ball at the fairy palace which my daughter enjoyed playing.Those people who enjoy criticising the way Mattel operate the Barbie franchise will not have much difficulty finding things in this production to sneer at. If you, or more importantly your kids, are allergic to an excess of twee sweetness, then this film and the Barbie videos generally may not be for them.And the female characters are all on the thin side of plausibility: I'm not worried that watching this is going to give my own daughter anorexia as she likes food too much and has a good sense of the difference between fantasy and reality. And after all, the characters in this story are fairies, complete with wings! However, if you are worried that your children may be forming an unrealistic idea about how thin a healthy female body shape is, it is not quite impossible that this film may contribute to it.But on the plus side: it is beautifully made, it will hold the attention of most small children for long enough for the typical exhausted parent to clear the mess they have made in several rooms of the house or collapse for an hour's rest after doing so. And there are still a few more sophisticated jokes thrown in, so you won't be completely bored to death if you decide to watch it with your offspring.Overall this is not, in my opinion, quite as good as some of the previous Barbie videos, including the first two Fairytopia"" titles, but anything which can hold my children's attention as well as this film did clearly has something going for it.",4,"A new heroine for the fourth ""Fairytopia"" Barbie film",1211068800,"05 18, 2008",2008,4860,"['fourth', 'offering', 'Mattel', 'series', 'Fairytopia', 'Barbie', 'films', 'trend', 'ever',

So I can't compare it to the other ones (which I personally don't care about since I came here to read reviews about THIS movie only).  We really enjoyed this.  I'm surprised so many children are that scared at the ""scary"" parts of this movie...the bad goblin guys (forget the names) are pretty funny...yes, their goal is to eat butterfly fairies but they never really get that close and it made my daughter laugh to watch their bumbling.  Even at the ""scariest"" parts, all she did was hold her breath for a second or 2, but at this point, she has come to realize that in any movie like this the ending will be a happy one.  If I'm ever worried she hasn't gotten that point, I make sure I tell her and she's fine.  Without an antagonist, what would make any of these movies interesting?  The storyline is cute and we found it easy to follow (although after only 1 viewing, yeah, it's a bit hard to recall all of the character's names).  I liked that they included some Latin characters, although the main charcter, Mariposa, didn't sound Latina at all...I thought that wasn't very accurate, especially with the name ""Mariposa"".  I haven't let my daughter watch any of the Barbie movies because I figured they'd be very superficial about beauty, etc. but this had a nice storyline about believing in yourself and having confidence.  The 2 characters who ARE superficial end up seeing the error of their ways, and the lead female character saves the day.  Really, what more can you expect from a fairy movie?

1126511,A1PL7QILVQV3IF,B0010VDYKG,"The Taminator ""There's no going back. You've ...","[2, 3]","While Mariposa is probably the best of the Barbie Fairytopia series, it's certainly not the best of the Barbie films overall, and in fact is one that I love to hate at times. The first thing that threw me off was Kelly Sheridan not being in the lead role, but rather was the ""bad"" fairy. I only found this annoying, but young children might find this confusing, and it's not the last of things that might be a bit troublesome for kids.The fear of the dark that so many kids have is exploited in the movie with fairies only being safe in the light from the little bug-like skeezites, which kids may find scary by themselves. I have to wonder if this won't exacerbate the fear of the dark problem with some kids. The characters also seemed to dive right into eating strange plants without a second thought. Little ones who can't keep from putting things in their mouths could be confused the next time you tell them not to eat something bad. It might be a good idea to watch with them the first time around and point out some things to keep them  on the right track if they're particularly sensitive.On a much more serious note, there were only two black characters in this movie; one was a guard, and the other is the butler-- really!  I'd rather them not include something like this at all than to portray the only black characters as servants-- and not very bright ones at that. All the other characters seem to be light-skinned. While a lack of diversity in these movies seems to be a common complaint, I found it particularly irksome in a movie that really should have and could have had more of a variety of skintones in it. Because so many of the characters seemed to have Spanish accents, it's really inexcusable, especially considering the wide variety of Spanish-speaking people throughout the world.That said, *most* kids should not have major problems with anything in the story, and the issue with the dark-skinned characters will probably fly right over their heads-- no pun intended. Mariposa is much more colorful than Barbie movies in the main series (Princess and the Pauper, Rapunzel, etc.) and with all the movement, light and sparkle it will certainly entertain, even though it lacks the music and overall production quality of the main films. Kids will like it, but adults will probably not be as enthralled with it as withBarbie As The Princess and the Pauper, or the other non-fairy Barbie movies. There are better Barbie movies, and I would recommend considering those instead.",3,There are better Barbie movies,1227484800,"11 24, 2008",2008,2500,"['Mariposa', 'probably', 'best', 'Barbie', 'Fairytopia', 'series', 'certainly', 'not', 'best', 'Barbie', 'films', 'overall', 'fact', 'one', 'love', 'hate', 'times', 'first', 'thing', 'threw', 'off', 'was', 'Kelly', 'Sheridan', 'not', 'being', 'lead', 'role', 'rather', 'was', 'bad', 'fairy', 'only', 'found', 'annoying', 'young', 'children', 'might', 'find', 'confusing', 'not', 'last', 'things', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'troublesome', 'kids.The', 'fear', 'dark', 'so', 'many', 'kids', 'have', 'exploited', 'movie', 'fairies', 'only', 'being', 'safe', 'light', 'little', 'bug-like', 'skeezites', 'kids', 'may', 'find', 'scary', 'have', 'wonder', 'wo', ""n't"", 'exacerbate', 'fear', 'dark', 'problem', 'kids', 'characters', 'also', 'seemed', 'dive', 'right', 'eating', 'strange', 'plants', 'second', 'thought', 'Little', 'ones', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'putting', 'things', 'mouths', 'could', 'be', 'confused', 'next', 'time', 'tell', 'not', 'eat', 'something', 'bad', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'watch', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'point', 'out', 'things', 'keep', 'right', 'track', ""'re"", 'particularly', 'sensitive.On', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'note', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'black', 'characters', 'movie', 'one', 'was', 'guard', 'other', 'butler', 'really', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'include', 'something', 'portray', 'only', 'black', 'characters', 'servants', 'not', 'very', 'bright', 'ones', 'other', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'light-skinned', 'lack', 'diversity', 'movies', 'be', 'common', 'complaint', 'found', 'particularly', 'irksome', 'movie', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'variety', 'skintones', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'seemed', 'have', 'Spanish', 'accents', 'really', 'inexcusable', 'especially', 'considering', 'wide', 'variety', 'Spanish-speaking', 'people', 'world.That', 'said', '*most*', 'kids', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'major', 'problems', 'anything', 'story', 'issue', 'dark-skinned', 'characters', 'will', 'probably', 'fly', 'right', 'heads', 'pun', 'intended', 'Mariposa', 'much', 'more', 'colorful', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'main', 'series', 'Princess', 'Pauper', 'Rapunzel', 'etc', 'movement', 'light', 'sparkle', 'will', 'certainly', 'entertain', 'even', 'music', 'overall', 'production', 'quality', 'main', 'films', 'Kids', 'will', 'like', 'adults', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'enthralled', 'as', 'withBarbie', 'Princess', 'Pauper', 'other', 'non-fairy', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'are', 'better', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'would', 'recommend', 'considering', 'instead']",N/A
