Tells the tale of those who go to the event every year for various reasons and what happens in each of their journeys. The downside to the comic-related explosion to the mainstream movie world is that some of the quaint parts of it are gone and the old timers who go tell that side of the story. It's true with anything I guess once big business and hollywood get a hold of anything. Minus the new Avengers movie - although some would argue with that too. Oh yeah and Kevin Smith is in it.

While Spurlock delivers a visually appealing and technically competent film, it's all surface. This is a good rental but I can't see someone watching it twice. Staying within fairly predictable 'geek' categories, Spurlock confirms the view some have of SDCC attendees without bringing deeper insight. The most interesting person profiled, a soldier hoping for a post military art career, is also one of the least featured. It might be because he is also the least cliched. Feeling more like a commercial for SDCC than a true look at the event or a cross-section of attendees, I actually left the film less likely to attend. The 2007 attendee I viewed the film with had some complaints about the way some aspects were presented (For example, a toy collector running through the con claiming they can't do anything to him for running. In 2007 people were stopped, stripped of their tags and evicted for doing just that.

I actually went to the 2010 show that Spurlock used to document SDCC and I was surprised to see myself in the photo pit with others shooting the Mass Effect cosplayers.  Maybe I should get a residual.The film follows some fans and their stories, what their goals are for the con and a nice wrap-up with what they actually achieved.  I especially liked James and his girlfriend as he prepared to propose marriage to her at the Kevin Smith panel.  Very funny, especially when she makes the remark ""I hope James doesn't ask any stupid questions.""  Indeed.The clips from fans and actors was cool as well.  The Kevin Smith F-bombs at the end though, I could have done without.I've been following Mile High Comics outspoken owner Chuck Rozanski for some time, since he used to write for the now defunct Comic Buyers' Guide.  His insight into the comics business and getting in a free plug for Mile High was a smart business move getting it all on film.  Chuck is not totally correct that San Diego is not focused on comics.They are right though that comics have fallen to a secondary status with the A-List stars and Hollywood's impact on the show.To have to show dial down a bit to two shows has been proposed, aka Anaheim and San Diego.

1536855,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B007REV69Q,Theo,"[1, 1]","This documentary explores Comic-Con through the eyes of its participants: Principally those of a comic book dealer, two aspiring comic book artists, a costume creator, and a fanboy and fangirl couple. Celebrity-level participants such as Stan Lee, Matt Groening  and Joss Whedon also get regular look-ins. As a whole, the film is an affectionate homage to geek culture.The problem with this film is that it's EXACTLY what you'd expect given my short four-sentence summary above. At no point does the film provoke us, surprise us, or yield unexpected insights. There's really nothing wrong with it. But it's not like there's anything that stands out as especially right.Unless the world of pop-culture geeks is a complete mystery to you, I honestly don't think you'll come away from this experience knowing a single thing that you didn't already know going in - except perhaps that the most expensive Marvel comic book on the collectables market is apparently Red Raven #1. Oh, and the convention itself is now dominated by electronic arts rather than comic books per se. But again, no real surprises there. All dead-tree media are in trouble.Morgan Spurlock, the director of this film, makes some major departures from his usual style. Better known for more controversial offering such asSuper Size MeandPOM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold, what Spurlock has served up here seems rather tepid and lifeless by comparison. In this film Spurlock himself spends no time in front of the camera, and his usual sense of mischief and flair are nowhere to be found.It's all very plain-vanilla.In a way I feel a little mean having written this review. If nothing else the film did introduce us to some very likeable people. I wish them all well. But... I'm reviewing the film, not its subjects.

1536856,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B007REV69Q,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[16, 17]","The great thing about Morgan Spurlock's latest documentary, Comic-Con Episode IV: A Fan's Hope, is that you don't have to be some comic book fanboy with stacks of funnybooks up to your eyeballs(like yours truly) to get it. Spurlock, the innovative and fun loving documentary film maker behind investigative pieces like Super Size Me and The Greatest Movie Ever Sold, isn't trying to expose much of anything here. He just seems content to revel in the geeky pop culture goodness, and that's why this is undoubtedly his most fulfilling film to date.That's not to say this is Spurlock's most insightful work, because clearly it isn't. At it's core, this is a celebration of all that the San Diego Comic-Con stands as now, and that is the holy Mecca for lovers of...well, anything pop culture related. Comic books, anime, role playing, you name it and it's there. But the event has also come to be a place of opportunity for many others, and besides highlighting the adults who walk around dressed up like Darth Maul or Sailor Moon, the main focus is on a handful of people who are relying on Comic-Con to change their lives.There's the two wannabe comic books artists looking to impress an editor and hopefully get a job at a major publishing company. The harsh reality of the comic book industry is that maybe 1% of all art submissions gets approved and lead to careers, and Spurlock, who usually takes a tongue in cheek approach to even the most serious subjects, doesn't flinch away from the truth. The film also shows us a young, nerdy(we nerds can call one another that) couple attending the event, with the guy planning to pop the big question at a Kevin Smith Q&A.; And then there's Holly, a remarkable costume designer who hopes to impress at the annual masquerade event with a dramatic re-creation of the Mass Effect video game.By far the most intriguing story of all is that of Chuck, a veteran of the comic book retailer wars. As owner of Mile High Comics, the largest online retailer for comics, he counts on Comic-Con to get him through the year and turn a profit. While the bulk of the film is basically one big nerdgasm, Chuck's story presents the simple truth of the comic book industry and it's relation to San Diego Comic-Con, and that's that the industry is dying and those who run the event don't seem to notice or care. Comic-Con has become about much more than comic books now, and as the seller booth dwindles and fewer people show up, more and more retailers like Chuck are falling by the wayside.For those who have watched Comic-Con grow basically at the expense of the comic book industry, Chuck's storyline may be a bit of a downer, but you'll instantly feel better when icons like Kevin Smith, Eli Roth, and Joss Whedon start sharing the crazy experiences they've had that can only happen at a place like Comic-Con. Smith, in particular, seems especially in tune with what makes the attendees tick, for they make up a sizable portion of his fan base. Oh, and of course there's Stan Lee, the unquestioned king of all things Marvel Comics, looking spry and boisterous as ever.Unlike Spurlock's other movies, he keeps himself out of the camera, choosing to simply be an observer and not a participant. Plenty of other directors, some very high profile documentary film makers, would have tried to become the focus in some way and been totally out of place in that environment.
