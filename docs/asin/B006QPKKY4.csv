1518993,A2NH2LWXY8EA5I,B006QPKKY4,"Alberto Giovannelli ""Astro-Zombie""","[1, 2]","I heard that they were making a sequel to ""Showgirls"" not too long ago. One day I was messing around w/ my Google TV and saw that it could play Amazon Instant Videos. I've never done this before (because I'm not one to sit in front of my computer screen to watch a movie), but, I was so excited, I started browing the massive selection they have on here. When I stumbled upon ""Showgirls 2"" to purchase on dvd, I was ecstatic, and sad. Ecstatic because, well, IT'S ""SHOWGIRLS 2""! Sad, because I didn't have enough money to purchase the dvd. HOWEVER, I saw on the same page that it was available to rent for $2.99! Well, it just so happens I had $5 on my card :) I yelled to my wife in the kitchen and told her they had ""Showgirls 2"" for rent. She immediately got excited and said we had to watch it with dinner. When I saw the running time for 2 and half hours, I lost it! This is gonna be awesome!We sit down at the table, and I hit ""purchase"". As soon as it's done, I hit ""play"".....I've never been so happy with a purchase in my life.This movie was done with the intent of what movies are made to do...entertain. And, obviously, the only people that are going to check this out are people like me, who enjoy the campiness of the first classic film, ""Showgirls"" (which I own both as a deluxe dvd w/ a ton of extra goodies, AND on phenomenal blu-ray). Now, obviously, this is a low budget effort, and you're not going to get the same...how do I say...""film quality"" (?) of the first one. But, like I said, if you're a fan of the first one and you enjoy campy films, this is for you.Is it laughable? Absolutely! But, Ms. Riffel knows this. I mean, come on, there's a section on her website titled, ""Versayce Boutique"" :) She's a fan of the first film (obviously), and knows it's cult royalty, which is why I loved this one. Some characters from the first one come back, making it all the more enjoyable. There's also a pool scene to almost rival the one from the first one.Seriously, I can't recommend this enough. If you're looking for a serious film to spend a few bucks on, well, this isn't the one to do it on. But, if you thought the first one was ridiculous, and you're curious as to how Penny Slot continued with her life after the events of the first film, then please, I urge you...check this out. It's only $3!Also, if you like what you saw, do an online search for the official website (it'll probably be deleted if I post it on here), and see if you can get ""Showgirls 2: Pennies from Heaven"" playing at a theater in your town!",5,2 and a half hours of camp GOLD!,1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,2538,"['heard', 'were', 'making', 'sequel', 'Showgirls', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'One', 'day', 'was', 'messing', 'around', 'w/', 'Google', 'TV', 'saw', 'could', 'play', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Videos', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'sit', 'front', 'computer', 'screen', 'watch', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'started', 'browing', 'massive', 'selection', 'have', 'here', 'When', 'stumbled', 'Showgirls', '2', 'purchase', 'dvd', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'sad', 'Ecstatic', 'well', 'IT', 'SHOWGIRLS', '2', 'Sad', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'money', 'purchase', 'dvd', 'HOWEVER', 'saw', 'same', 'page', 'was', 'available', 'rent', '2.99', 'Well', 'just', 'happens', 'had', '5', 'card', 'yelled', 'wife', 'kitchen', 'told', 'had', 'Showgirls', '2', 'rent', 'immediately', 'got', 'excited', 'said', 'had', 'watch', 'dinner', 'When', 'saw', 'running', 'time', '2', 'half', 'hours', 'lost', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'awesome', 'sit', 'down', 'table', 'hit', 'purchase', 'As', 'soon', 'done', 'hit', 'play', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'so', 'happy', 'purchase', 'life.This', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'intent', 'what', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'do', 'entertain', 'obviously', 'only', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'check', 'out', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'campiness', 'first', 'classic', 'film', 'Showgirls', 'own', 'deluxe', 'dvd', 'w/', 'ton', 'extra', 'goodies', 'phenomenal', 'blu-ray', 'Now', 'obviously', 'low', 'budget', 'effort', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'get', 'same', 'how', 'do', 'say', 'film', 'quality', 'first', 'one', 'said', ""'re"", 'fan', 'first', 'one', 'enjoy', 'campy', 'films', 'you.Is', 'laughable', 'Absolutely', 'Ms.', 'Riffel', 'mean', 'come', 'section', 'website', 'titled', 'Versayce', 'Boutique', 'fan', 'first', 'film', 'obviously', 'cult', 'royalty', 'why', 'loved', 'one', 'characters', 'first', 'one', 'come', 'back', 'making', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'also', 'pool', 'scene', 'almost', 'rival', 'one', 'first', 'one.Seriously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'enough', ""'re"", 'looking', 'serious', 'film', 'spend', 'few', 'bucks', 'well', ""n't"", 'one', 'do', 'thought', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'ridiculous', ""'re"", 'curious', 'how', 'Penny', 'Slot', 'continued', 'life', 'events', 'first', 'film', 'then', 'please', 'urge', 'check', 'out', 'only', '3', 'Also', 'like', 'what', 'saw', 'do', 'online', 'search', 'official', 'website', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'deleted', 'post', 'here', 'see', 'can', 'get', 'Showgirls', '2', 'Pennies', 'Heaven', 'playing', 'theater', 'town']",SHOWGIRLS 2: Penny's From Heaven

1518999,AU198IEOK853S,B006QPKKY4,MediaFan,"[15, 18]","Showgirls 2: Penny's from Heaven is written by, directed by, and stars Rena Riffel-- she played Penny in Showgirls. Somehow, Rena managed to get several Showgirls cast members together for this sequel which I would call a spoof-quel. The returning cast members are the people who played James (he's the guy who gave Nomi's dance to Penny), Jeff (the guy who steals Nomi's luggage / gives her the ride to Vegas), and Phil Newkirk (the one who got yelled at because of the whole ""Caesar sing"" shenanigan). Also in the cast is Peter Stickles (while not from Showgirls, he has been in The Lair and Shortbus).Those who love the original Showgirls (those who go to the midnight screenings, laugh their heads off, applaud and cheer at the pool scene, yell out ""different places,"" or bust a gut anytime Nomi hits anything) will definitely enjoy this endeavor helmed by Rena Riffel.There is one caveat: it is not Showgirls. The cinematography, visuals, sound, and sleekness of the Showgirls 2 is incredibly... different from Showgirls. Showgirls 2 was made direct to video, and most likely on a very small budget. It looks like a very well-made student film, but in a way it adds to the fun, the humor, and the charm of Showgirls 2.So, as long as you love the original Showgirls, this will make for a great viewing with a group of friends. Pop some popcorn, get ready for some thigh-slapping lines (this movie was really well-written, kudos are definitely deserved here), and enjoy a trip that many of us thought we'd never get to on: a trip back to see one of our favorite showgirls in action once again.Five Stars all the way!",5,Wholeheartedly Recommended with one caveat,1326412800,"01 13, 2012",2012,1619,"['Showgirls', '2', 'Penny', 'Heaven', 'written', 'directed', 'stars', 'Rena', 'Riffel', 'played', 'Penny', 'Showgirls', 'Somehow', 'Rena', 'managed', 'get', 'several', 'Showgirls', 'cast', 'members', 'together', 'sequel', 'would', 'call', 'spoof-quel', 'returning', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'played', 'James', 'guy', 'who', 'gave', 'Nomi', 'dance', 'Penny', 'Jeff', 'guy', 'who', 'Nomi', 'luggage', '/', 'ride', 'Vegas', 'Phil', 'Newkirk', 'one', 'who', 'got', 'yelled', 'whole', 'Caesar', 'sing', 'shenanigan', 'Also', 'cast', 'Peter', 'Stickles', 'not', 'Showgirls', 'been', 'Lair', 'Shortbus', '.Those', 'who', 'love', 'original', 'Showgirls', 'who', 'go', 'midnight', 'screenings', 'heads', 'applaud', 'cheer', 'pool', 'scene', 'yell', 'different', 'places', 'bust', 'gut', 'anytime', 'Nomi', 'hits', 'anything', 'will', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'endeavor', 'helmed', 'Rena', 'Riffel.There', 'one', 'caveat', 'not', 'Showgirls', 'cinematography', 'visuals', 'sound', 'sleekness', 'Showgirls', '2', 'incredibly', 'different', 'Showgirls', 'Showgirls', '2', 'was', 'made', 'direct', 'video', 'most', 'likely', 'very', 'small', 'budget', 'very', 'well-made', 'student', 'film', 'way', 'fun', 'humor', 'charm', 'Showgirls', '2.So', 'as', 'long', 'love', 'original', 'Showgirls', 'will', 'make', 'great', 'viewing', 'group', 'friends', 'Pop', 'popcorn', 'get', 'ready', 'thigh-slapping', 'lines', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'well-written', 'are', 'definitely', 'deserved', 'here', 'enjoy', 'trip', 'many', 'thought', ""'d"", 'never', 'get', 'trip', 'back', 'see', 'one', 'favorite', 'showgirls', 'action', 'once', 'again.Five', 'Stars', 'way']",SHOWGIRLS 2: Penny's From Heaven

Porn-quality acting, basically no plot, shoddy camerawork, etc.  However, there is a sly sense of humor running through it, particularly in Rena Riffel's character Penny.

Some scenes just go on for too long, and the conversations are pretty ridiculous and go nowhere.  And the sex scenes/nudity are even less erotic/sexy than they were in the original Showgirls (which is referenced several times).
