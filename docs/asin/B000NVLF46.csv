It doesn't preach and therefore doesn't get bogged down in philosophy and metaphysics. It teaches only by pointing the camera at its subject, the 90-day winter retreat of the nuns of Korea's Baek Hung temple. If you ever wanted to know what a mediation retreat is like, this film will give you a nice taste.What you see is that the nuns spend a lot of time inside sitting quietly. This is followed by periods of walking in circles in the courtyard. Once in a while they go out for a hike in the surrounding mountains, or collect wood from the forest. They cook meals. On New Year's they do a lot of cleaning and praying and visiting of nearby temples. And that's about it.Of course if you know nothing or very little about Buddhism or Zen then you might be a bit confused about just what's going on. The Korean film makers, who produced this for Korean television, could assume their audience had the background to understand what they were being shown. And so they simply pointed the camera. There are one or two brief interviews with the head nuns, and a couple of scenes of the nuns chatting together, but for most of the film's 65 minutes all you hear are bells and wind and rain.The film ends with the nuns leaving the temple:Where did I come from?Where am I going to?Came with the cloud,Going with the wind.Then, what is thisthat is coming and going?#",5,Just sitting,1241222400,"05 2, 2009",2009,1429,"['one', 'better', 'films', 'Zen', 'very', 'simple', 'reason', ""n't"", 'preach', 'therefore', ""n't"", 'get', 'bogged', 'down', 'philosophy', 'metaphysics', 'only', 'pointing', 'camera', 'subject', '90-day', 'winter', 'retreat', 'nuns', 'Korea', 'Baek', 'Hung', 'temple', 'ever', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'mediation', 'retreat', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'nice', 'taste.What', 'see', 'nuns', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'sitting', 'quietly', 'followed', 'periods', 'walking', 'circles', 'courtyard', 'Once', 'while', 'go', 'out', 'hike', 'surrounding', 'mountains', 'collect', 'wood', 'forest', 'cook', 'meals', 'New', 'Year', 'do', 'lot', 'cleaning', 'praying', 'visiting', 'nearby', 'temples', 'about', 'it.Of', 'course', 'know', 'nothing', 'very', 'little', 'Buddhism', 'Zen', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'confused', 'about', 'just', 'what', 'going', 'Korean', 'film', 'makers', 'who', 'produced', 'Korean', 'television', 'could', 'assume', 'audience', 'had', 'background', 'understand', 'what', 'were', 'being', 'shown', 'so', 'simply', 'pointed', 'camera', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'brief', 'interviews', 'head', 'nuns', 'couple', 'scenes', 'nuns', 'chatting', 'together', 'most', 'film', '65', 'minutes', 'hear', 'are', 'bells', 'wind', 'rain.The', 'film', 'nuns', 'leaving', 'temple', 'Where', 'did', 'come', 'Where', 'am', 'going', 'Came', 'cloud', 'Going', 'wind.Then', 'what', 'coming', 'going']",Zen Buddhism: In Search of Self

The cinematography was terrible as if the person holding the camera was clueless. At least if it was shot beautifully then I could at least have a relaxing time watching it.There seemed to be no point to this documentary, and there was nothing to be learned.  The short interviews with the nuns were superficial in content, and this is the only Buddhist documentary I have seen that made Buddhism seem stupid.

The film follows a months-long annual meditation period for Korean Buddhist nuns, and if you enjoy the day-to-day interplay and activities of these nuns, who are often quite worldly and even interact with some male monks at one point, you'll enjoy it.  There's a lot of laughter and camaraderie in between the sesshins.  While most of the time they eat very simple food, their meditation is occasionally punctuated by delicious-looking feasts, contests and games that seem to be enjoyed thoroughly.  The nuns don't have the most exciting life at the monastery, but the film offers insights into the different personalities of these dedicated meditators, who all have a common goal:  achieving enlightenment.  It will not give you any clues as to how to do it yourself, but as a fly-on-the-wall, slice-of-life presentation, it's worth a look.",4,Buddhist nuns in search of enlightenment,1389139200,"01 8, 2014",2014,962,"['other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'what', 'film', 'about', 'what', 'about', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'film', 'months-long', 'annual', 'meditation', 'period', 'Korean', 'Buddhist', 'nuns', 'enjoy', 'day-to-day', 'interplay', 'activities', 'nuns', 'who', 'are', 'often', 'quite', 'worldly', 'even', 'interact', 'male', 'monks', 'one', 'point', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'lot', 'laughter', 'camaraderie', 'sesshins', 'most', 'time', 'eat', 'very', 'simple', 'food', 'meditation', 'occasionally', 'punctuated', 'delicious-looking', 'feasts', 'contests', 'games', 'seem', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughly', 'nuns', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'most', 'exciting', 'life', 'monastery', 'film', 'insights', 'different', 'personalities', 'dedicated', 'meditators', 'who', 'have', 'common', 'goal', 'achieving', 'enlightenment', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'clues', 'how', 'do', 'fly-on-the-wall', 'slice-of-life', 'presentation', 'look']",Zen Buddhism: In Search of Self

Throughout long meditation periods, the Zen master's discreet encouragements, manual labor, cooking, eating, and more long meditation periods, the camera NEVER intrudes, creating in the viewer a natural sense of being present at retreat. The silence of the film is positively life-giving. The pungent natural winter landscapes outside the monastery remind me of Korean film master Ki-Duk Kim's work.

This is not for someone looking to learn how to become a Zen Buddhist or really much about Zen Buddhism's history (although some nuns do venture into the topic of the Buddha). The movie is more about a retreat during the Lunar calender and the nuns practice in their journey. It breaks down day by day activities, chants, prayer and of course meditation. Looking from the outside (like one reviewer stated) this might look like cruel and unusual punishment, but there is much more to this, this is, in a nutshell, MIND OVER BODY and the movie explains some of these things if you simply watch and read the subtitles.Overall, I enjoyed it, I feel it reminds all of us that life is and can be simple it just depends whether you choose to look at it from the top of the mountain and see yourself in the big picture or if you choose to look at it from the bottom of a mountain and see yourself against the world.",4,not a how to but in the foot steps of,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,1028,"['movie', 'caught', 'attention', 'have', 'recently', 'rekindled', 'interest', 'Buddhism', 'more', 'particularly', 'Zen', 'Buddhism', 'not', 'someone', 'looking', 'learn', 'how', 'become', 'Zen', 'Buddhist', 'really', 'much', 'Zen', 'Buddhism', 'history', 'nuns', 'do', 'venture', 'topic', 'Buddha', 'movie', 'more', 'retreat', 'Lunar', 'calender', 'nuns', 'practice', 'journey', 'down', 'day', 'day', 'activities', 'chants', 'prayer', 'course', 'meditation', 'Looking', 'outside', 'one', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'might', 'look', 'cruel', 'unusual', 'punishment', 'much', 'more', 'nutshell', 'MIND', 'OVER', 'BODY', 'movie', 'things', 'simply', 'watch', 'read', 'subtitles.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'feel', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'simple', 'just', 'choose', 'look', 'top', 'mountain', 'see', 'big', 'picture', 'choose', 'look', 'bottom', 'mountain', 'see', 'world']",Zen Buddhism: In Search of Self
