The characters are very cute in the movie and I think it is a great movie for kids maybe 5 or 6 and above to watch, it does have some rather creepy looking characters in it that may freak smaller kids out.

278072,A2IF845YKIDO7T,6301966732,Jason,"[4, 4]",Back in the late 90's when the Special Editions of the Star Wars movies came out both of Ewok movies and the two videos from the cartoon series Droid and Ewoks were re-released. Both were out of print for over ten years and quickly after their re-release went out of print again (you can find the Droids and Ewoks cartoons here at amazon though dvd's would be great). ... I'd love for both Ewok films to be re-released onto video (in the clamshell packaging like it came in back in the late 90's) and especially dvd. I know both were made for t.v. movies and most of the time those aren't in high demand but this is Star Wars releated and of course anything related to Star Wars sells. Basically everthing else has been updated or re-released from the Star Wars universe ...It's sad that the two Ewok movies haven't gotten their fair shake. I know there are alot of Ewok haters out there but there are also alot of fans and even if you're not a fan of the Ewoks you'll pick this up if ever re-released because you're a fan of Star Wars.RE-RELEASE THE TWO EWOK MOVIES!!!!,5,This NEEDS to be re-released!,1038873600,"12 3, 2002",2002,1070,"['Back', 'late', '90', 'when', 'Special', 'Editions', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movies', 'came', 'out', 'Ewok', 'movies', 'two', 'videos', 'cartoon', 'series', 'Droid', 'Ewoks', 'were', 're-released', 'were', 'print', 'ten', 'years', 'quickly', 're-release', 'went', 'print', 'again', 'can', 'find', 'Droids', 'Ewoks', 'cartoons', 'here', 'amazon', 'dvd', 'would', 'be', 'great', ""'d"", 'love', 'Ewok', 'films', 'be', 're-released', 'video', 'clamshell', 'packaging', 'came', 'back', 'late', '90', 'especially', 'dvd', 'know', 'were', 'made', 't.v', 'movies', 'most', 'time', 'are', ""n't"", 'high', 'demand', 'Star', 'Wars', 'releated', 'course', 'anything', 'related', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Basically', 'everthing', 'else', 'been', 'updated', 're-released', 'Star', 'Wars', 'universe', 'sad', 'two', 'Ewok', 'movies', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'fair', 'shake', 'know', 'are', 'alot', 'Ewok', 'haters', 'out', 'there', 'are', 'also', 'alot', 'fans', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'Ewoks', ""'ll"", 'pick', 'up', 'ever', 're-released', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Star', 'Wars.RE-RELEASE', 'THE', 'TWO', 'EWOK', 'MOVIES']",N/A

278074,A120V3RVSK1O1K,6301966732,K. Ostrowski,"[1, 1]","I'm going to do my best to review this movie based on the perspective of a casual moviegoer.  I found it in a bargain bin when I was young, and it looked cute, so I watched it.  I remember enjoying it somewhat, though I was a little upset that it had absolutely nothing to do with established Star Wars canon, didn't even mention the force, and had no noticable actors from the previous films except the ewoks.  At the time, I didn't even realize that there had been another Ewoks movie.  As of now, though, I've seen both, though I found this one more memorable.In this movie, a young girl named Cindal is friends with the ewoks on Endor; at least until some alien monsters closely resembling orcs show up and kill her family.  The deaths aren't graphic, but they do happen, and they add an element of tragedy and seriousness to the film right from the start, as she and the ewok named Wicket try to escape from the clutches of the orcs and their leader.  The orc leader's name is apparently Terak, according to the back of the video box, but it always sounds a little like Turok when other characters say it.Terak is out to find a new source of power with which to do bad and evil things, apparently.  Supporting him in this quest are an army of orcs armed with blasters, and a dark witch, who, again, according to the box, is apparently named Charal, though I never heard her name spoken aloud in the film.It was to get this power that Terak killed Cindal's family, and yet, once he has it, he doesn't know what to do with it, quickly deduces that Cindal might know, realizes she's missing, and sends his evil minions out to search for her.Out in the wild, Cindal and the ewok Wicket are met by a speedy little critter named Teek, who leads them to a house owned by Wilford Brimley, who plays the surprising role of a grouchy, but basically nice old guy in this film.  He's apparently named Noa in the story being proposed by the film.At first, Wilford wants Cindal and Wicket to leave, but quickly warms up to them, participating in some of the most time-honored relationship cliches in all of film, and when Cindal is kidnapped multiple times later on, Wilford predictably leads the rescue missions.  Ultimately, he and Cindal succeed in restoring power to his space ship by the end of the movie.  I don't feel I'm giving too much away when I say all this, because once you realize what kind of movie this is, you'll see all the plot points coming for miles too.Much of the acting in this film is pretty terrible, the movie has a nasty habit of not explaining its own plot points thoroughly enough, and the villains and heroes alike are just about as shallow and transparent as they come.Really, though, it comes down to a couple of big questions.  First, is this a worthy successor to the Star Wars movies?  No.  Is this even a good movie?  Not really.  However, and I say this without hesitation, there are much worse movies out there.For one thing, this film is unpretentious in the extreme.  At no point does it claim to be Star Wars, or indeed, to have anything to do with Star Wars, despite the insertion of ewoks, Endor and blaster weapons.  It doesn't even really try to be like Star Wars; it's just trying to tell its own kind of story in its own kind of world, and honestly, there's just something charming about that.The movie succumbs to a lot of cliches, and most of the characters are right off the shelf.  Cindal is a damsel in distress (sort of,) Wilford is an grouchy but nice curmudgeon, Terak is a pure evil, power-hungry villain, Charal is his much more intelligent henchman with a bag of tricks, and so forth.  We've all seen these character archetypes before, in better and worse movies, done better and worse.However, some of the scenes between Wilford and Cindal, as cliched as they are, can be just a little charming, and the way that Wicket and Cindal escape from various dangers during the early parts of the film actually seemed fairly well thought-out.Even at its worst, this film can be pretty exciting, and the mushy way it presents its main protagonists is perfectly acceptable to younger kids, provided they don't find the mild violence and blaster fire too disturbing.Even to older viewers, like myself, certain things about this film are enjoyable to watch, and I honestly found the ewoks themselves much less grating than they were in Return of the Jedi; maybe because this film takes itself less seriously.  On top of that, some of their escapes from danger were devised fairly cleverly.I certainly can't mistake this for a good movie in any sense, but it didn't hurt me the way most bad movies do, and I think that the main reason for that may be that this movie at least tries to be fun, and make you laugh, and although it doesn't completely succeed, it doesn't fail uncomfortably either.  There's just something endearing about the way they try to use all the old cliches, and yet, have some fun with them along the way.I did notice just how silly and condescending this movie was throughout, but frankly, I can't give it less than three stars.  It wasn't catastrophically bad, like Biodome or an MST3K feature, nor was it entirely devoid of fun or adventures, like most truly poor movies.  They tried to come up with a story for this, and it didn't really work out all that well, but...  They tried, and as I said, it wasn't all that terrible.That having been said, if you don't already own this movie, I don't recommend going out of your way to purchase it.  It's not really any less violent than Star Wars, which was an overall better movie in all respects, and there are many other, better movies you could be watching.  However, if you should happen to pick this film out of a bargain bin for five to seven bucks, the way I did, you may not feel completely ripped off by the time the day's over.",3,Not as bad as you'd
