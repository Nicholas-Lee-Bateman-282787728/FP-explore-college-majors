Amazon continues to lump together all reviews of a film, despite the fact that this is the 3rd DVD release of this film (and the first from WB).Some films don't age well.  Some weren't that good to begin with.  Supergirl, sadly, falls into the latter category.  Nevertheless, the film isn't a complete waste of time.  Helen Slater does her best with the incomprehensible script.  And the flying sequences are best of all the big-screen ""Super"" films.  No CGI here, folks.  This is 1984, and that's really Slater (or her double in the long shots) up there on wires.The film was previously available from Anchor Bay in an extended addition, with 24 extra minutes of footage edited back in.  This WB release is the ""European version,"" with 10 additional minutes added to the theatrical cut.  The extra stuff doesn't amount to much; it's mostly extended scenes with Faye Dunaway and Peter Cook.  Only hardcore Supergirl fans (if there are any?) will care about these minor changes.Despite its many flaws, the film LOOKS great.  For that, plus the great flying sequences and Helen Slater, I give it 3 stars.",3,The Road to Midvale is paved with good intentions,1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,1188,"['Note', 'review', 'single-disc', 'Warner', 'Bros.', '2006', 'DVD', 'release', 'Supergirl', 'Amazon', 'lump', 'together', 'reviews', 'film', 'fact', '3rd', 'DVD', 'release', 'film', 'first', 'WB', '.Some', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'age', 'well', 'were', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'begin', 'Supergirl', 'sadly', 'latter', 'category', 'Nevertheless', 'film', ""n't"", 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'Helen', 'Slater', 'best', 'incomprehensible', 'script', 'flying', 'sequences', 'are', 'best', 'big-screen', 'Super', 'films', 'CGI', 'here', 'folks', '1984', 'really', 'Slater', 'double', 'long', 'shots', 'up', 'there', 'wires.The', 'film', 'was', 'previously', 'available', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'extended', 'addition', '24', 'extra', 'minutes', 'footage', 'edited', 'back', 'WB', 'release', 'European', 'version', '10', 'additional', 'minutes', 'added', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'extra', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'amount', 'much', 'mostly', 'extended', 'scenes', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Peter', 'Cook', 'Only', 'hardcore', 'Supergirl', 'fans', 'are', 'will', 'care', 'minor', 'changes.Despite', 'many', 'flaws', 'film', 'LOOKS', 'great', 'great', 'flying', 'sequences', 'Helen', 'Slater', 'give', '3', 'stars']",N/A
175506,A1R8LZYZR3377O,1419828371,ajsteele,"[4, 4]","Supergirl is basically a poor movie. It does however have a shinning star in Helen Slater as Supergirl who even though overtly green at times manages to give the character not only an appealing presence, but a natural innocence. She overcomes the clumsy script and amplifies her alien persona. If your a comic book buff (especially of DC comics) you may have a natural inclination to want to like the film, but feelings can't save the awful reality of the movie. The shame is that they had a real Supergirl surrounded by a big mess. Childish antics which make you cringe even more than Superman's ""Otis"" abound. With a premise that has Supergirl traveling to Earth to re-obtain the Omegahedron that will save her city, can all be lost?Coming off the ridiculousness of Superman III, I can only figure that the filmmakers thought audiences wanted more buffoonery. Or, they just sank into their own selfish indulgences which were not all bad. The gaudiness remains pervasive throughout though. Hart Bochner's contrived ""romance"" is embarrassing, especially the poetry scenes. The villains to me are all clownish to the point of distraction. Had Faye Dunaway played her evil witch straight, we may have had something. Mia Farrow is bland and Peter O'Tool turns in an ""oh well the planet will blow up"" delivery. We also never got any bullets bouncing off Supergirl which made me, well, mad. On the plus side the Phantom Zone is well done and Supergirls perils within it bring a needed darkness that plays nicely. The flying scenes are quite good for the era, and playing the THX remastered dvd in a blu ray player adds beauty. The only way to watch this film IS the THX version as the print is surprisingly good compared to the grainy ""directors cut"".The ""limited edition"" dvd which contains the THX version (and directors cut)is pricey now being that ""only' 50,000 were made. You may get lucky on ebay as I did. The extras are well worth it for ""Superman family"" DC fans. The lengthy ""making of the film"" featurette is a great watch as Slaters evolution is discussed. Multiple trailers, storyboards, and a cautious directors commentary fill out the disc. Supergirl fails in most ways, but strangely triumphs in giving us a memorable film heroine embodied by Slater that succeeds in it's own right.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------",3,SUPERSTAR + super-extras (THX),1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,2373,"['Supergirl', 'basically', 'poor', 'movie', 'however', 'have', 'shinning', 'star', 'Helen', 'Slater', 'Supergirl', 'who', 'even', 'overtly', 'green', 'times', 'manages', 'give', 'character', 'not', 'only', 'appealing', 'presence', 'natural', 'innocence', 'clumsy', 'script', 'alien', 'persona', 'comic', 'book', 'buff', 'especially', 'DC', 'comics', 'may', 'have', 'natural', 'inclination', 'want', 'like', 'film', 'feelings', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'awful', 'reality', 'movie', 'shame', 'had', 'real', 'Supergirl', 'surrounded', 'big', 'mess', 'Childish', 'antics', 'make', 'cringe', 'even', 'more', 'Superman', 'Otis', 'abound', 'premise', 'Supergirl', 'traveling', 'Earth', 're-obtain', 'Omegahedron', 'will', 'save', 'city', 'can', 'be', 'lost', 'Coming', 'off', 'ridiculousness', 'Superman', 'III', 'can', 'only', 'figure', 'filmmakers', 'thought', 'audiences', 'wanted', 'more', 'buffoonery', 'just', 'sank', 'own', 'selfish', 'indulgences', 'were', 'not', 'bad', 'gaudiness', 'pervasive', 'Hart', 'Bochner', 'contrived', 'romance', 'embarrassing', 'especially', 'poetry', 'scenes', 'villains', 'are', 'clownish', 'point', 'distraction', 'Had', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'played', 'evil', 'witch', 'straight', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'something', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'bland', 'Peter', ""O'Tool"", 'oh', 'well', 'planet', 'will', 'blow', 'up', 'delivery', 'also', 'never', 'got', 'bullets', 'bouncing', 'off', 'Supergirl', 'made', 'well', 'plus', 'side', 'Phantom', 'Zone', 'well', 'done', 'Supergirls', 'perils', 'bring', 'needed', 'darkness', 'nicely', 'flying', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'era', 'playing', 'THX', 'remastered', 'dvd', 'blu', 'ray', 'player', 'beauty', 'only', 'way', 'watch', 'film', 'THX', 'version', 'print', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'compared', 'grainy', 'directors', 'cut', 'limited', 'edition', 'dvd', 'THX', 'version', 'directors', 'cut', 'pricey', 'now', 'being', 'only', '50,000', 'were', 'made', 'may', 'get', 'lucky', 'ebay', 'did', 'extras', 'are', 'well', 'Superman', 'family', 'DC', 'fans', 'lengthy', 'making', 'film', 'featurette', 'great', 'watch', 'Slaters', 'evolution', 'discussed', 'Multiple', 'trailers', 'storyboards', 'cautious', 'directors', 'commentary', 'fill', 'out', 'disc', 'Supergirl', 'most', 'ways', 'strangely', 'triumphs', 'giving', 'memorable', 'film', 'heroine', 'embodied', 'Slater', 'own', 'right.']",N/A

The cheapness of the production shows in the bad sets and costumes. The plot makes barely any sense at all. Supergirl comes to earth to find the lost ""omegahedron"" without which her home, Argo City, is doomed to perish within a few days. Then, for no reason - and with no explanation -whatsoever, she adopts a secret identity and enrolls at private girl's school. She is alternately smart and stupid. This alien vistor knows enough to type up a fake resume for herself, yet doesn't know how to put on a bra. Helen Slater looks great as Supergirl, but her acting talent is marginal, and she comes across as sweet but rather dumb. (In recent years, Helen has played Superman's mother, Lara, on the TV show ""Smallville."" If anything, she is more beautiful as an older woman, and has matured greatly as an actress.) Although only doing it for the money, Peter O'Toole is too talented to completely phone in his performance. Faye Dunaway seems to be warming up for her role in ""Mommy, Dearest"" and has a grand time chewing the scenery, but never does she come across as a true menace.

Supergirl,a.k.a. Kara,is sent to Earth. Her cousin Superman is mentioned, but never makes an appearance,since the late Christopher Reeve wanted nothing to do with this movie. Kara confronts thugs, goes to a boarding school. In the meantime, the evil sorceress Selena (Dunaway) is in control of an amusement park. She has a female companion (Brenda Vaccaro) Lest one think these two dowdy ladies are carrying on a super-Sapphic romance, Selena lusts for a hunky carpenter/gardener.

While certainly not the best of what of the Superman films offer, it is a good attempt at the mythology. The story is basically about Supergirl going to Earth to reclaim something lost from her home planet, which ultimately lands in the hands of an amateur witch, Selena, who wants nothing less than world domination. The story holds together well enough to keep me from pressing fast forward. Slater as Supergil captures the wide eyed girl struggling with being a human and saving her alien race. I enjoyed the villains that emerged in this film. It was interesting to see magic take on the Girl of Steel, rather than kryptonite.

I am an advocate for good comic book based movies and this should be up there with the likes of Superman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Blade.  Helen Slater really made Kara believeable. Actually, all of the acting is pretty top notch. With the likes of Peter O' Toole, Faye Dunway, and Brenda Vaccaro this was more than a adventure film. The score is beyond words. It captures the power and vulnerabilty of Supergirl to a &quot;T&quot;. The effects are outstanding especially considering this was made in the early 80's without Lucas or Speilberg's name on it. So let's get the record straight: before there was Lara Croft, even before Xena threw her first chakram there was a girl from Argo City named Kara and she was Super!!

While the film wasn't QUITE as horrendous as 'Superman III' had been, it came close, and the critical and audience reaction soured the Salkinds on the entire 'Superman' franchise (they passed the torch to Golan/Globus, with Christopher Reeve taking on much of the production duties for 'Superman 4'.)It is surprising, therefore, that the Special Edition 2-Disc DVD is amazingly good! Loaded with extras, it gives the viewer an enlightening glimpse at the behind-the-scenes work that creates a motion picture, from the casting (Slater was a charming, unpretentious girl of 19 when she won the role, and you can see her 'grow into' the part during the filming), to the tension on set (Jeannot Szwarc was not the easiest man to work with, and you can see him 'age' during the long shoot), to the marketing of the film (trying to revitalize a franchise that was already past its prime). 'Superman' expert Scott Bosco puts the film into perspective, noting its many flaws, but also acknowledging that there were good points, as well (there was a ballet-like quality to Slater's flying scenes, as well as her exuberance at having superpowers). Best of all is Szwarc's commentary...while he acknowledges that the film didn't turn out entirely as he had hoped, he was able to make it a more personal film than Richard Lester had, in his 'Superman' efforts.The viewer is given two versions of the film to choose from; a slightly lengthened theatrical version, and a 'Director's Cut', with a lot of extra footage that never made it to the theatres.While 'Supergirl' has never achieved more than a campy cult status, the Special Edition DVD 'set the bar high', and showed the industry what 'Special' meant.

She makes a graceful curve out of the sky to trace her fingers along the surface of a pond and then ascend again. It was a well conceived scene and well executed on the screen.The star power was not sparred for her co-stars, who at the time were (and some still are) much better known actors than Helen. Faye Dunaway plays a fake psychic who stumbles upon Kryptonian technology which gives her immense (and seemingly) magical powers. Peter O'Toole is her Kryptonian mentor who risks everything to help Kara (Supergirl) eventually escape from the Phantom Zone.The movie has a lot of charm, and from my perspective, succeeded to a large degree because Helen looked GREAT in the Supergirl suit!

175532,A2DE249NY4SMSN,1419828371,Chad Taylor,"[0, 0]","I rate this version 2 1/2 to 3 stars and the DVD even more so.Jeannot Szwarc's 138 minute Director's Cut makes this fairly flawed film a little more palatable. The one thing that shines throughout most of this convoluted movie is Helen Slater. At the time she was only 19 years old and this was her first feature film.  Helen Slater's characterization of Linda Lee and Supergirl are nearly faultless and critics, no matter how they felt about the movie, picked up on it. Some critics even going so far as to say that Helen's characterization of meek, mild Linda Lee (Supergirl's earthly identity) was more convincing than Reeve's Clark Kent. Watch Helen's reactions to a budding flower, trees, water, horses, her ability to fly, the water splashing onto her face from her first shower. Kara has never experienced any of these things in Argo City and Helen carries it off with a complete sense of wonder, even when she experiences her first crush. Roger Ebert even said that Slater was the best thing in the film. If you can keep your focus on Slater's acting and Jerry Goldsmith's light and uplifting musical score, I think you can get through this relatively unscathed.  If you're still having difficulty, fortunately for you, this DVD set is loaded with Extras. The hour long ""The Making of Supergirl"" is a must see!  It shows how they found Helen, shows them filming many sequences (the flight ballet), it has interviews with many of the stars during the production and even shows Helen's rigorous training regimen.  Extras include several U.S. and Foreign theatrical trailers, TV spots, stills and posters, talent bios, the International cut of the film with optional audio commentary by the director and project consultant and a 16 page bonus booklet. Anchor Bay no longer produces this Limited Edition set (mine is numbered 25,599 of 50,000). If you can find it though, and you love the Maid of Might, then buy it.

I truly believe Anchor Bay has outdone itself in presenting Supergirl in both the International and Director's version.  The DVD also contains great stills from promotions and from the movie.  My only complaint about this DVD is that the Director's version, which is on a separate disc, is not encoded in DD 5.1.  (Of course, the International version is.)Obviously, I did not buy this DVD for special features.  I truly do like this movie.  For one, the special effects were well ahead of its time and still quite fun to watch.  The so- called &quot;flying ballet&quot; sequence is one of the most beautiful and convincing flying scenes I have ever seen.  You will believe Supergirl is actually flying.  The movie also offers some platonic romance between Supergirl and Ethan (Hart Bochner) which is surprisingly welcome.  The scene where Supergirl rescues Ethan and flies him to safety is reminiscent of the &quot;Can you read my mind&quot; sequence from Superman I.When discussing the virtues of this film, it is impossible to omit Ms. Faye Dunaway.  Faye, like all great actors, has the ability of turning a potentially ridiculous and embarrassing role into an acting lesson.  Before Glenn Close's Cruella DeVille, we have Faye as Selena, the has-been witch turned supervillain by the power of the Omegahedron.  It is Faye's intense and campy performance that stands out above everything in this movie, including Helen Slater's Supergirl looks.So, what went wrong with this film that made Supergirl a box-office bomb?  I have to blame the scriptwriter.  The first half of the movie truly does not make much sense, nor does it serve to help the viewer understand the logic of the remainder of the film.  For example, when Supergirl arrives on earth and emerges from her spaceship, she is fully clothed in her Supergirl outfit.  How?  Nobody knows.  Later, when Supergirl decides to become Linda Lee, she changes hair color and uniform in the twinkling of an eye.  I'm sorry, but magical uniform changes were not one of the original Supergirl's powers.  Whatever enabled her to do this should have been explained in the beginning of the movie.  This also would have been a  time to explain why she had such an understanding of her new powers and the culture on earth.If you can get passed these deficiencies (chalk them up to details left out in script rewrites), then you will truly enjoy this film, especially the second half.

It was super stupid, we realized even at that age. We got home and made fun of it all afternoon and evening, laughing so hard at each others mimic of scenes from the film. The way she flew, the bad acting by Helen Slater(yeah it was her first film but dang come on). Peter O'Toole, Mia Farrow, and Faye Dunaway all looked like they just showed up for a paycheck, judgeing by their god awful performances. Where ""Superman:The Movie"" focused on verisimilitude, this focused, as did ""Superman II"" to a certain Richard Lester degree and full Richard Lester degree for ""III"" on illogical fantasy and a one dimensional cartoon, comic book style. You're never fully engaged by this due to the rotten direction(this and ""Santa Claus:The Movie"", both Salkind productions ended Jeannot Szwarc's directing career),and by extension unconvincing acting. The only thing to admire is it was the first female superhero film. I see why it was cut down for U.S. release as was ""Superman IV:The Quest For Peace"". When it's this bad less is more. The international version was bad enough, but the director's cut further cheapens and worsens the film and fully shows the Salkinds lack of ability to properly and successfully produce a multi-million dollar production, beginning with a dreadful script and casting, and ending with ridiculous acting due to a director without vision of his own, much needed due to the fact that the Salkind and Spengler vision was a mess. They were full of themselves and I guess smoking their own press to think their dumb, cheap ideas would work. The millions spent could have elevated this to a good, if not great film had they known what they were doing. They saw what Richard Donner's approach brought(a critical and financial super success for ""Superman:The Movie"") but their ego's got in the way and they refused his approach, no matter how successful it proved to be. So they did it their way and look what we got: what Richard Lester directed in ""II"" and then ""III"" followed by this. Lame, lame, lame. What a missed opportunity. What a shame. Hopefully there will never be another Salkind production ever again. The special features on the Anchor Bay release an overblown, overlong vintage making of documentary shows the egos of the producers, they acted as if they were making ""Gone With The Wind"". Hopefully, this current WB release has no special features, the film is bad enough. WB released this film everywhere in the world but here, and saw it flop country to country, so they sold the releasing rights to Columbia's new sister company, Tri-Star Pictures looking to release a known commodity, but were not rewarded.

175542,A239PPUVV8O0U0,1419828371,D. A. Reed,"[1, 1]","After the abysmal Superman III, I think the Salkinds were trying to redeem themselves by not making this spin-off a farce. With some top notch supporting actors surrounding Helen Slater (much like in Superman I with Reeve), it makes the movie more enjoyable. Slater's portrayal is spot-on for a stranger in a new world, still speaking in a Shakspearean tone. Dunaway makes for an interesting villain and sidekick Brenda Vaccaro has several funny moments, and both have tremendous chemistry. Peter O'Toole makes for an interesting Brando-esque character in this but doesn't make an impact in Supergirl's struggle until the end. Mia Farrow, though given very good billing, hardly qualifies as starring in it, more like a cameo (much like Helena Bonham Carter in Harry Potter V and Christopher Lee in The Golden Compass).I would've picked someone else to play Lucy Lane (though the actress does have a resemblance to Margot Kidder). As far as story goes, this is very original, especially having Supergirl go up against someone who uses magic (not as well known weakness against her and Superman) instead of just laying Kryptonite on her. And having the villain be in way over her head when she gets the Omegahedron is another twist instead of being a rich business man. The effects are on the level of Superman 3, being very good.

Given that, I purchased  a copy of this DVD set, rather excited to watch a new 2hr 18m Directors Cut  version of a film that Ive seen countless of times through the years...The Directors cut features footage that was cut off and left out of the  Domestic release. A shame, since the footage gave Supergirl and Selena more  depth than the U.S theatrical release gave them.The Directors Cut alone  would have been worth buying had it been released as a single disc, but  this has more. On Disc one there is the &quot;International Version&quot;  of the film featuring footage never seen in U.S (odd since I swear Ive seen  it before), but better than that it has an audio commentary by the  director. The A.C is really interesting because the director reveals  secrets to the films key scenes as to how they were filmed and script  changes (HE TALKS ABOUT HOW CHRISTOPHER REEVES, AS SUPERMAN, WAS A PIVOTAL  CHARACTER IN THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT).Disc One also features a 45+ min  &quot;The Making of 'Supergirl'&quot; featurette which was originally aired  on ABC as a special. The featurette included screen-tests with Helen  (Slater, Supergirl), and the actual footage when shes told that she has the  part. Also, they show how they filmed many of the scenes. Its a really  interesting behind-the-scenes footage that has to be watched!Also  included are countless trailers, TV spots and More. And the comic book  effect on the menu screen is great to.

But they must have run out of budget for this one. The end product is a really cheesy take on the Maid of Might, Kara Zor-El, the original Supergirl. In fact, it's so cheesy that watching this DVD is pure nostalgic fun. I'm a child of the cheesy 1980s anyway!The flying effects here are not as good as those in the Superman movies but then who needs effects. Helen Slater as Supergirl/Linda Lee is the best special effect in this movie. Additional points should be given in that this movie is set in the Superman movie continuity - we get to meet Lucy Lane (Lois' sister) and Jimmy Olsen. A newsreader on a car radio informs us that Superman is off-planet at this time, thus explaning his rather glaring absence in this movie.The story centers on Kara's childish mistake in Argo City that supposedly doomed the city unless she can make amends by coming to earth to retrieve something called the Omegahedron (or something like that!). Unfortunately this Omega-thingy is now in the hands of two ugly aunties (Faye Dunaway is one of them) who lusts after this young man (can't even remember his name). This young man is also in love with Supergirl. Then the auntie (Faye) decides to bring about the end of the world. And yes, Peter O'Toole also appears (although I still can't see the purpose of his character in the film). In short, a really beautiful Supergirl fights two aunties over a young man and Peter O'Toole makes an appearance.

But, it was at least at age five, a year after it was released to theaters.  Apparently, most people didn't think much of it, because it was viewed historically as a commercial flop.  A part of it may have been circumstantial, though.  Supergirl production was started hot off the heals of the rap on Superman III, a film that performed abominably in the theaters.  Pending who you asked, many people were starting to get burnt out on the Superman cannon, and they must've seen a teenage, female equivalent as a joke.  If it had been produced and released in between Superman II and III, that might've had a more positive, circumstantial effect.Here, Helen Slater stars in her first leading role as Kara, the Kryptonian cousin to Superman (official name of Kal-El) who left Krypton with her parents to live in the inner-space settlement of Argo City.  At the film's start, her mentor Zaltar (Peter O'Toole), incidentally the city's forefather, makes a mistake that forces a key power source, an omegahendron) to disappear into outer space, necessitating Kara's swift departure to rescue it, Zaltar's lifelong expulsion into Phantom Zone and possibly resulting in the whole city's eventual degradation.  The omegahendron surfaces on earth and, the little ball is snared by a narcissistic, pretentious and vindictive would-be witch named Solina (Faye Dunaway) and her jittery sister, Bianca.When Kara surfaces on earth herself, she discovers she has unprecedented powers of flight, strength, hearing and mater manipulation.  She uses an armband transmitter to detect the general location of the ball.  Eventually, she manages to disguise herself to conceal her attire.  Then, she passes as a student at a private university in a town called Midvale.  She passes as Clark Kent's cousin, Linda Lee and forges a letter of recommendation from him.  The headmaster places her with Lucy Lane, a sophomore who happens to be sister of Lois Lane and love interest of Jimmy Olsen (Marc McClure reprising his Superman role).  As a coincidence, their math teacher, a man named Nigel is also Solina's erstwhile instructor of black magic.  He pursues her repeatedly, and she repeatedly rebuffs him.Meanwhile, all the girls at the school (including Linda) lust after a big, muscular groundskeeper named Ethan.  But, Bianca also catches his eye, as does Solina, who says he belongs to her.  Using a cheap form of black magic, she seduces him and tries to make him fall for her.  However, her magic goes badly awry, and his heart instead falls to Linda (after she changes to her true identity and saves him from physical danger).  Back in her dorm, Linda is forced to do battle with Solina's evil magic (as Kara) and comes out of this bout unscathed.  Then, she gets a signal from her transmitter that the omegahendron is functioning, and she tears off for the abandoned amusement park where the evil sisters reside.And, who should be waiting for her but Ethan, spouting uncharacteristic love poetry and brandishing flowers & chocolates for Linda.  The two are ambushed by the sisters, and Solina attempts to eliminate Linda, unsuccessfully.  Linda is forced to change back into Kara and carry Ethan away to a distant lakeside.  Solina eventually caves in and asks Nigel to help her eliminate Kara (whom she appropriately christens ""Supergirl"").  Nigel arrives at the park with a wand built for pure evil, which they use to lure Ethan back; Solina steals the wand, petrifies Nigel and creates a tall mountain with a castle on top in the exact middle of town.  Supergirl arrives in the castle to rescue Ethan, only to find herself imprisoned in a diamond-shaped piece of glass, which then expels her to the Phantom Zone along with Zaltar.  Meanwhile, she succeeds in subduing the whole community and seizing Lucy & Jimmy.at first, she doesn't know where she is, but she knows she's lost her powers.  When she and Zaltar come into contact with each other, Kara tries convincing him that they shouldn't let the Phantom Zone consume them and that if they don't try and escape, Argo City is finished and so is earth.  She uses straightforward teenage irony to finally win him over, and they push off for a deadly vortex.  If they can circumvent the perimeter of the vortex, they can get to a way out.  However, with the aide of her magic mirror, Solina spies on Kara & Zaltar and tries summoning elements of the Zone to kill them.  She succeeds in finishing Zaltar, who lets himself die so Kara can push through.  This she does, regaining her earthly abilities and flying straight through Solina's mirror and into the castle.  Supergirl manages to rescue Lucy, Jimmy & Nigel from the cages they've been sealed in and engages a battle with Solina's dark magic.  With help from Ethan and Nigel, Supergirl not only overpowers the magic but manages to create a vortex and shunt Solina & Bianca through the broken mirror and into the Phantom Zone.  Afterwards, things return to normal, and Kara is able to return to Argo City with the reclaimed omegahendron.I for one thought the movie was well worth watching.  I've actually watched it multiple times.  It didn't include Christopher Reeve, Margot Kitter, Jackie Cooper or Gene Hackman, but that has very little to do with the quality of the film.  It's an almost-completely new cast, and that does in fact add to the unacknowledged greatness of the film.  It did go kind of far when the character of Ethan mentioned the fact that Supergirl [and Superman] could ""leap tall buildings in a single bound.""  But, that was probably the only remotely inappropriate Superman reference in the finished product.There are only two real problems I've ever had with this film, and neither one of them could make me change my rating.  First, How does Kara find out that Superman's earth identity is Clark Kent?  Also, could someone explain to me where Solina could possibly have learned about the Phantom Zone, let alone send Supergirl there or manage to manipulate its elements?",5,There and Back

175555,A1OJB1AQVIKFG1,1419828371,Eric Krupin,"[6, 8]","There is a long (though presumbably not proud) tradition of highly trained English actors prostituting themselves in trashy American movies. Alan Rickman's role in &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; parodies the practice even as it embodies it - a pretty neat trick. Laurence Olivier in &quot;The Betsy&quot; was once considered the standard-bearer in this field. Jeremy Irons in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; shows how far the state of the art has been advanced since then. But, to my mind, Peter O'Toole's appearance in &quot;Supergirl&quot; sets a record that will never be broken. It is truly one of the great spectacles of human self-abasement. If you have ever paid money to watch a carnival geek bite the head off a chicken (or would, given the opportunity), you owe it to yourself to see this movie.And what better way to do so than with this limited 2-disc special edition! I suppose I shouldn't sneer; plenty of my favorite movies are unlikely to ever appear on a Top 100 list from the American Film Institute. But this really seems like one of the most demented conceptions for a consumer product that I've ever seen. &quot;The director's cut&quot;, for God's sake? You mean it was actually an Eric Stroheim-caliber masterpiece before those vulgarians at the studio got their philistine hands on it?I don't have anything against camp. Honestly. I think &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot; is one of the best comedies of the 80s and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise. (Well, maybe I'll just say something really sarcastic about him after he leaves.) But I have a fierce enmity against incompetent movies that, to save face, try to pretend that they're camp. It devalues the currency.One scene in particular demonstrates the utter lack of entertainment value in this fiasco. Supergirl is confronting two evildoers - street &quot;toughs&quot; who look like they belong in a Michael Jackson video. One lecherously begins to lift up the hem of her skirt, to see what color her super-panties might be. (Admit it: if you're reading this, you've wondered yourself.) Supergirl slaps his hand away (not even with super-strength - no broken bones here) and primly chastises him to &quot;Stop that!&quot; It's as if, in the middle of &quot;American Pie&quot;, Shannon Elizabeth put on a bulky sweater and recited a Catherine MacKinnon lecture on the objectification of women.",1,Will no one shed a tear for poor Peter?,1006732800,"11 26, 2001",2001,2376,"['long', 'presumbably', 'not', 'proud', 'tradition', 'highly', 'trained', 'English', 'actors', 'prostituting', 'trashy', 'American', 'movies', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'role', 'quot', 'Galaxy', 'Quest', 'quot', 'practice', 'even', 'pretty', 'neat', 'trick', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'quot', 'Betsy', 'quot', 'was', 'once', 'considered', 'standard-bearer', 'field', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'quot', 'Dungeons', 'amp', 'Dragons', 'quot', 'how', 'far', 'state', 'art', 'been', 'advanced', 'then', 'mind', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'appearance', 'quot', 'Supergirl', 'quot', 'record', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'broken', 'truly', 'one', 'great', 'spectacles', 'human', 'self-abasement', 'have', 'ever', 'paid', 'money', 'watch', 'carnival', 'geek', 'head', 'chicken', 'would', 'given', 'opportunity', 'owe', 'yourself', 'see', 'movie.And', 'what', 'better', 'way', 'do', 'so', 'limited', '2-disc', 'special', 'edition', 'suppose', 'should', ""n't"", 'sneer', 'plenty', 'favorite', 'movies', 'are', 'unlikely', 'ever', 'appear', 'Top', '100', 'list', 'American', 'Film', 'Institute', 'really', 'one', 'most', 'demented', 'conceptions', 'consumer', 'product', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'quot', 'director', 'cut', 'quot', 'God', 'sake', 'mean', 'was', 'actually', 'Eric', 'Stroheim-caliber', 'masterpiece', 'vulgarians', 'studio', 'got', 'philistine', 'hands', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'camp', 'Honestly', 'think', 'quot', 'Big', 'Trouble', 'Little', 'China', 'quot', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', '80s', ""'ll"", 'fight', 'anyone', 'who', 'otherwise', 'Well', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'something', 'really', 'sarcastic', 'have', 'fierce', 'enmity', 'incompetent', 'movies', 'save', 'face', 'try', 'pretend', ""'re"", 'camp', 'currency.One', 'scene', 'particular', 'utter', 'lack', 'entertainment', 'value', 'fiasco', 'Supergirl', 'confronting', 'two', 'evildoers', 'street', 'quot', 'quot', 'who', 'look', 'belong', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'video', 'One', 'lecherously', 'lift', 'up', 'hem', 'skirt', 'see', 'what', 'color', 'super-panties', 'might', 'be', ""'re"", 'reading', ""'ve"", 'wondered', 'Supergirl', 'hand', 'away', 'not', 'even', 'super-strength', 'broken', 'bones', 'here', 'primly', 'chastises', 'quot', 'Stop', 'quot', 'middle', 'quot', 'American', 'Pie', 'quot', 'Shannon', 'Elizabeth', 'put', 'bulky', 'sweater', 'recited', 'Catherine', 'MacKinnon', 'lecture', 'objectification', 'women']",N/A

Helen Slater excels in her role as Kara, the cousin of Kal-El (Superman). It stays loyal to the basic storyline of Supergirl, but doesn't explain enough for those who don't know Supergirl's backstory. Fans of the movie wonder how Kryptonians are still alive after the planet blew up, the movie doesn't tell you of how her city was blown off with a chunk of the planet that wasn't destroyed. That isn't told in the movie, so I can see where some would be scratching their heads.The special effects are done very well, and the entire scene of the movie when Kara first lands on Earth is well done. From the beginning when she comes out of the lake to when she is flying over the horses and cities, it is a beautiful sight to see. I think that the highlight fight scene of the movie is when Supergirl fights the invisible dragon, and also the fight scene at the carnival with Selena.Faye Dunaway does a fair job as the villainess Selena, a witch who has world domination on her mind. She is annoying at times, but gets less annoying as the movie progresses. Marc Maclure returns Jimmy Olsen for a little bit in the movie, which is a nice touch to see from the Superman films.

Faye Dunaway  as the villainess, lending a little star weight.  Keep your expectations way low and you'll probably enjoy much of it, in spite of yourself.  I haven't turned it off, and I will when movies bore me too much.  This one hasn't yet, though it is undeniably ridiculous.  NOTE: THIS IS MY REVIEW AFTER HALF AN HOUR.""Oh terrific, the old dangling in a cage thing"".Actually, it has the flavor of a cult B-movie at times.  There's something of the Rocky Horror Picture Show in Faye Dunaway's fiendish character - like where are the whips and chains?  Supergirl is probably one of the sexiest superheroes to come along, beautiful in her SuperGirl outfit with blond hair, less so as a brunette in her girl school uniform.  Besides being superequiped with all the powers that run in the SuperFamily, she's also quite the romantic.  THIS AFTER AN HOUR AND A HALF.Actually, this movie gets better as it goes along and fully deserves cult status for it's combination of ridiculousness, dark B movie scenarios and a quirkiness that develops into all the classic proportions as the movie goes on.  The eighties was a good decade for that kind of thing I guess.  This movie has dark netherworlds, a black magic villain and a pretty superhero with a girlish charm.  What more could you ask for?  I can understand some people giving this five stars.  For the right audience, it could be.p.s. - the cover of the US version takes itself too seriously I think.  My Japanese zone 2 version, as usual, has the essential cover art - in this case, the original movie poster (it's a drawing of Supergirl flying up into space with a demon behind her and a schoolgirl in uniform in the background - drawing style similar to original Star Wars poster).  I don't understand why dvd makers insist on updating and modernizing artwork for classic movies, or why they can't use images from the movie that have more sense of art, mystery, or general cleverness or humour in them - or original movie posters for some. I just bought Henry Winkler's ""The One and Only"" (1978) and they didn't bother to use the original art of the film (which had been used for the videotape) but instead opted for some cheesy modern photo that was supposed to encapsulate the feeling of the movie, but which totally didn't have and feeling of the times.  People often watch these movies to capture that retro flavor.

175564,ACKDSX71VI5HY,1419828371,"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader""","[4, 4]","SPOILERS FOLLOWI like ""Supergirl.""  Starring Helen Slater, Faye Dunaway, Brenda Vaccaro, Peter Cook, and Peter O'Toole, it's actually a fairly entertaining movie.  Some of its most glaring shortcomings are some of the most obvious strengths of the early Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" movies(of which this is an indirect 1984 spinoff), but this movie is also able to stand on its own.Opening on Argo City, the movie does a decent job of establishing a distinct look for a contained, peaceful world.  Helen Slater is a good Kara Zor-El.  The chemistry between Ms. Slater and Peter O'Toole powers the early scenes and sets up a vaguely interesting plot point.  Mr. O'Toole plays Zaltar, a scientist and philosopher who is the custodian of the Omegahedron, a pulsating source of power for the planet.  Even as a kid I knew that(SPOILER) the Omegahedron gets blown to Earth and Kara leaves to bring it back.  I cannot help but compare this movie, in some respects, to the original ""Superman"" film.  It actually begged comparison initially by usinng the famous John Williams ""Superman"" theme in U.S. movie trailers.  This movie uses its own theme, a serviceable would-be epic from composer Jerry Goldsmith.  Character differentiation between Kara and Supergirl is almost nonexistent, since the movie rushes to Supergirl and the audience is robbed of a satisfactory origin story we get in most comic book adaptations. Despite this, Helen Slater's performance itself stays consistently solid throughout the picture.  The movie has a strong villainess in Faye Dunaway's witch Selena.Some storytelling cheapness blows the high-minded theme of saving a world down a notch.  The screenplay spends too much time on a romantic rivalry between Supergirl and Selena over a blue-collar worker named Ethan, played by Hart Bochner.  I'm not necessarily saying the filmmakers needed to completely omit the idea, but more screentime for Peter Cook or Peter O'Toole would not have hurt the movie.""Supergirl"" also marks the first time the audience sees the inside of the Phantom Zone, a hellish land of exile previously only visualized as a floating mirror in the first and second ""Superman"" movies. Essentially a vast and dangerous black desert, the Phantom Zone sequence in this movie remains a durable high point.I cannot give this movie an extremely low rating, frankly in part because the ""Superman"" movies it spun off from set such a high standard it would be arguably impossible to expect greatness from this film.  This is still a very good movie, and deserves appreciation on its own merits.",4,"""Supergirl"" makes some mistakes, but its biggest drawbacks are timing and misguided marketing",1307664000,"06 10, 2011",2011,2576,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOWI', 'Supergirl', 'Starring', 'Helen', 'Slater', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Brenda', 'Vaccaro', 'Peter', 'Cook', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'actually', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'most', 'glaring', 'shortcomings', 'are', 'most', 'obvious', 'strengths', 'early', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Superman', 'movies', 'indirect', '1984', 'spinoff', 'movie', 'also', 'able', 'stand', 'own.Opening', 'Argo', 'City', 'movie', 'decent', 'job', 'establishing', 'distinct', 'look', 'contained', 'peaceful', 'world', 'Helen', 'Slater', 'good', 'Kara', 'Zor-El', 'chemistry', 'Ms.', 'Slater', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'early', 'scenes', 'up', 'vaguely', 'interesting', 'plot', 'point', 'Mr.', ""O'Toole"", 'Zaltar', 'scientist', 'philosopher', 'who', 'custodian', 'Omegahedron', 'pulsating', 'source', 'power', 'planet', 'Even', 'kid', 'knew', 'SPOILER', 'Omegahedron', 'blown', 'Earth', 'Kara', 'bring', 'back', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'compare', 'movie', 'respects', 'original', 'Superman', 'film', 'actually', 'begged', 'comparison', 'initially', 'usinng', 'famous', 'John', 'Williams', 'Superman', 'theme', 'U.S.', 'movie', 'trailers', 'movie', 'own', 'theme', 'serviceable', 'would-be', 'epic', 'composer', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'Character', 'differentiation', 'Kara', 'Supergirl', 'almost', 'nonexistent', 'movie', 'Supergirl', 'audience', 'robbed', 'satisfactory', 'origin', 'story', 'get', 'most', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptations', 'Helen', 'Slater', 'performance', 'consistently', 'solid', 'picture', 'movie', 'strong', 'villainess', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'witch', 'Selena.Some', 'storytelling', 'cheapness', 'high-minded', 'theme', 'saving', 'world', 'down', 'notch', 'screenplay', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'romantic', 'rivalry', 'Supergirl', 'Selena', 'blue-collar', 'worker', 'named', 'Ethan', 'played', 'Hart', 'Bochner', ""'m"", 'not', 'necessarily', 'saying', 'filmmakers', 'needed', 'completely', 'omit', 'idea', 'more', 'screentime', 'Peter', 'Cook', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'would', 'not', 'have', 'hurt', 'movie', 'Supergirl', 'also', 'first', 'time', 'audience', 'inside', 'Phantom', 'Zone', 'hellish', 'land', 'exile', 'previously', 'only', 'visualized', 'floating', 'mirror', 'first', 'second', 'Superman', 'movies', 'Essentially', 'vast', 'dangerous', 'black', 'desert', 'Phantom', 'Zone', 'sequence', 'movie', 'durable', 'high', 'point.I', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'movie', 'extremely', 'low', 'rating', 'frankly', 'part', 'Superman', 'movies', 'spun', 'off', 'set', 'high', 'standard', 'would', 'be', 'arguably', 'impossible', 'expect', 'greatness', 'film', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'appreciation', 'own', 'merits']",N/A

Faye Dunaway & Peter O'Toole are both fine actors with many acclaimed roles under their belts. Here however, they appear totally miss-cast and just overact and mug for the camera for most of the picture. Some of the action set-pieces are impressive and inspiring, but the film just seems like one long misfire. By this point it was painfully easy to see that the producers didn't give a crap about the character(s) and that they were just in it to keep milking the cash cow as long as possible and for every cent they could. Still the film makes for a fun, harmless time-waster on a rainy weekend. And as I mentioned earlier, Helen Slater sure is easy on the eyes! *SIGH* ;-)The film is the longer European cut with about 10 extra minutes or so of footage edited back in. It looks very nice and the audio (and score) sound really strong and clean. Director Jeannot Szwarc did an OK job directing JAWS II, and a lot of women (and men) around the world simply adore his Richard Matheson-based love story SOMEWHERE IN TIME. Here however, he doesn't seem to ever get his feet firmly planted under him. He keeps trying to find a single focus, but keeps wondering from one style and to another. He does have some interesting comments to make in the commentary track, which also includes insights from Superman historian Scott Bosco as well. SUPERGIRL is an okay movie. It's not awful but it's not great, either. Certainly not on the same level as the original SUPERMAN. It's fun but not something that's a must-see or must-own, unless you're a collector of all things Superman. I got mine used, for cheap, so I feel it was worth the money.

I hope to meet her someday, before I pass away because I love her, and I will always will! Anyhow, I will be as objective as I can.It is well know what the Salkinds tried to do: make more money by exploring all the possibilities from the Superman mithos. Therefore, Supergirl was the most obvious choice back then. Now, if we refer to the bad things: the story is not that bad, however, the naiveness and the holes in the plot are. There are too many things unreasonable within the story that if flaws of consistency. The treatment of the characters seems to pay tribute to those of Lex Luthor with a fool sidekick, Perry White=Mr.Danvers, Marc Maclure again as Jimmy Olsen, and the innocence of Kara (as Linda Lee) comparing it to Reeve's Clark Kent. NOW THE GOOD THINGS: The FX are amazing, even cooler than Superman III and Superman IV together. Kara flying ballet is just amazing, the phantom zone and the witch's 'witchery' are from the world beyond!! The Kara's character is one of the best performances, taking into account that it was her first major role. Helen really brought Kara to life, and not to mention that she looks so beautiful and hot in that costume. Even when the movie did not hit the box office it turned to be a legend! Everybody knows that Helen Slater is Supergirl, and probably she will be forever, a nostalgia comes when this movie is presented in TV. The DVD treatment is another two tumbs up. The special features where the director explains what he was trying to accomplish, Helen acting IN the costume, and her appreciations about the character at that time. The booklet and the Director's cut are just amazing, because it gives us additional footage that we would never imagined. And trust me, I have seen the movie about 500 times and I will never get tired!

When I heard that there was a version coming out with an additional 24 minutes previously unseen by American audiences, I thought this would explain a lot of things. For instance, how did Argo City survive the destruction of Krypton? How did she get that costume? How could she even have known anything about Superman or his Clark Kent/Daily Planet connection? After all, she wasn't even born when the baby Kal-El was sent to Earth.It is interesting to listen to director Jeannot Szwarc talk about how decisions were made, but it seems like a lot of wasted effort, although it explains a lot to find out how many last minute changes were made to the script. It would have made better sense to have the commentary on the &quot;director's cut&quot; version rather than the &quot;international version&quot;. Even the usually reliable Jerry Goldsmith provides an unmemorable score.I have never appreciated Szwarc's talent as a director. Besides the fact that this story is not very good, Szwarc's direction lacks pace, suspense, and scale. The extra footage adds nothing and just makes the film a longer mess.

She looks great as Supergirl, plus plays the role to perfection with grace, beauty, and just the right touch of naivet&eacute;. Just about every scene with her, as Supergirl, was worth watching. (This alone makes the movie worth owning, for me anyway.)The Bad: First and foremost, the story itself.The ""inner space"" city of Kryptonians looked awful and seemed a weak premise for introducing her. It was also ridiculous how she needed some capsule to get her to Earth, through what appeared to be space, but she returned by flying into a lake?Ok, given the premise that she needs to find the power source for her city in order to save it from destruction, why is she bothering with a secret identity? It is a waste of time, both for the film itself, and for her mission. The purpose of a secret identity is to be able to live a ""normal"" life while not in your superhero persona. As Supergirl never had any intention of staying on Earth longer than it took to find the Omega-hedron, the secret identity is pointless. It is also detrimental to her search (she detects it in the car driving away, but does not want to get in trouble for ditching class, so lets the car get away?)The romance with the gardener adds nothing to the story and, other than his looks, there's nothing special about him that should be causing Supergirl and her witch rival to be fighting over him so intently.Finally, the fact that the villain is a witch that got her power because fortune dropped the Omega-hedron in her lap, almost literally, was very weak.Lastly, the denomic monster at the end will be keeping me from letting my kids watch this one for some time.I'd love to see a remake in whcih the actress does as good a jab as Helen Slater does as protraying Supergirl, only with a new storyline that makes sense.",3,The good and the bad...,1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,1818,"['Good', 'Helen', 'Slater', 'great', 'Supergirl', 'role', 'perfection', 'grace', 'beauty', 'just', 'right', 'touch', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'Just', 'scene', 'Supergirl', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'alone', 'movie', 'worth', 'owning', 'anyway', 'Bad', 'First', 'foremost', 'story', 'itself.The', 'inner', 'space', 'city', 'Kryptonians', 'looked', 'awful', 'seemed', 'weak', 'premise', 'introducing', 'was', 'also', 'ridiculous', 'how', 'needed', 'capsule', 'get', 'Earth', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'space', 'returned', 'flying', 'lake', 'Ok', 'given', 'premise', 'find', 'power', 'source', 'city', 'order', 'save', 'destruction', 'why', 'bothering', 'secret', 'identity', 'waste', 'time', 'film', 'mission', 'purpose', 'secret', 'identity', 'be', 'able', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'not', 'superhero', 'persona', 'Supergirl', 'never', 'had', 'intention', 'staying', 'Earth', 'longer', 'took', 'find', 'Omega-hedron', 'secret', 'identity', 'pointless', 'also', 'detrimental', 'search', 'car', 'driving', 'away', 'not', 'want', 'get', 'trouble', 'ditching', 'class', 'so', 'car', 'get', 'away', 'romance', 'gardener', 'nothing', 'story', 'other', 'looks', 'nothing', 'special', 'should', 'be', 'causing', 'Supergirl', 'witch', 'rival', 'be', 'fighting', 'so', 'intently.Finally', 'fact', 'villain', 'witch', 'got', 'power', 'fortune', 'dropped', 'Omega-hedron', 'lap', 'almost', 'literally', 'was', 'very', 'weak.Lastly', 'denomic', 'monster', 'end', 'will', 'be', 'keeping', 'letting', 'kids', 'watch', 'one', 'time.I', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'remake', 'whcih', 'actress', 'as', 'good', 'jab', 'Helen', 'Slater', 'protraying', 'Supergirl', 'only', 'new', 'storyline', 'sense']",N/A

A squeaky clean Slater as the Girl of Steel has all the honesty and innocense needed to carry off her character. Faye Dunaway plays the evil sorceress who wants to rule the world by starting off with a small Mid-Western town and the Tom Cruise look-alike landscape man.Explained simply enough, Superman is on a peace-keeping mission trillions of light years away. Supergirl actually comes from an asteroid that survived Krypton's explosion. Peter O'Toole explains how they live in 'Innerspace'. Very confusing when you consider Supergirl flew in a magic orb off her asteroid, flew through the all too familiar 'vortex' and 'time rifts' to finally fly (in costume of course which magically appears) out of a lake on Earth. Of course when she lands dry as a bone on the shore, you wondered what you missed or what the heck is going on. But these comic book movie adaptions are not for the detail retentive who can tear this film apart.The love interest is what little girls dream of. A landscape guy who falls in love with Linda Lee (Supergirl in disguise) after a magic spell by Dunaway goes wrong. Linda practices kissing herself in the mirror after their first kiss, girl stuff to be sure.Well it's a good flick for me for a couple of reasons. Slater and Dunaway both look hot. Watch Dunaway flash her thighs a couple of times. And no guy can resist Slater in that VERY TIGHT Supergirl costume. She's got a great rack that make that big 'S' really stand out. Watch in the end of the film when she faces Dunaway in her evil fortress for the first time. When she sees Loverboy chained to a wall, she walks towards him and hits an invisible forcefield.

But then there are the good things; Helen Slater gives a good, if mannered, performance as Kara/Supergirl, and Hart Bochner makes hearts flutter as her love interest. Brenda Vaccaro, Marc McClure, and Maureen Teefy provide amusing support, and the flying scenes with Slater are great, a combination of flying and ballet and she looks so natural- her first scenes on Earth were the best thing in the movie. But what makes this film a 4-star movie are all the great extras; two versions of the movie, one with nearly 30 minutes of deleted scenes, including a hilarious ad-libbed scene about Jehovah's Witnesses, a great making-of documentary, in which we get a brief look at Supergirl's original movie outfit, headband and all, that was featured in the DC comic book, and insightful and often times funny commentary with director Jeannot Szwarc and Scott Michael Bosco, and a great booklet all combine to make this limited edition of Supergirl a real winner.

Siskel and Ebert thought it was disappointing and one newspaper headline claimed that it was a ""turkey that would never fly""! Supergirl was Alexander and Ilya Salkinds' attempt at keeping the dying Superman film franchise alive. In the past few years, there has been two prequels to X-Men(2000). Everything from the plot holes to the campy humor to the cardboard characters to the disjointed story has been criticized. Tri-Star Pictures cut forty minutes of footage from the U.S. version of the film and they made the movie even more incoherent!Supergirl is not a total failure. Helen Slater looks sexy, photogenic and fit as Supergirl and she does a good job playing Kara and her alter egos Linda Lee and Supergirl. Faye Dunaway gives a sincere, over the top performance as Selena, a power hungry witch who wants to conquer the world. Jeannot Szwarc(Jaws 2, Bug, Santa Claus) did a sincere job directing the film. Jerry Goldsmith's epic, energetic, inspiring, light-hearted Supergirl music score is an underrated classic. With the exception of the climax, the film is very fast paced. Supergirl is a rare big budget action-adventure film that has females in the lead roles. Brenda Vaccaro does her best playing Selena's half-wit stooge.  Supergirl was released on DVD in 1999 by Anchor Bay Entertainment in a special, expensive 2 disc edition that's out of print.

Criticisms that it lacks the &quot;maturity&quot; or flair of the first two SUPERMAN films just aren't really fair.  I mean, surely the director didn't want the film to just be a SUPERMAN film with  the only difference being the lead character?  Indeed, SUPERGIRL certainly has it's own identity and rarely feels like a SUPERMAN clone, so hats off to the filmmakers on that one.Helen Slater is actually perfect for the part, and it's a shame that she seems to have disappeared these days, whilst the supporting cast are hugely impressive, particularly the always reliable Peter O'Toole, whose scene with Slater in the Phantam Zone remains the most effective of the movie.  Faye Dunaway makes a splendidly over the top villain, even if her humorous portrayal means she lacks the danger that Hackman's Lex Luthor displayed in SUPERMAN, and Peter Cook is wonderfully sarcastic as the school teacher who likes to dabble in sorcery.The real star of the film though is Jerry Goldsmith's amazing score, which lends the film a power it just wouldn't have otherwise.  A genuine classic score, it's testament to Goldsmith's talent, that he's able to bring so much to the quality and atmosphere of a movie like this.Special effects wise, SUPERGIRL also impresses hugely, outclassing the SUPERMAN movies at evry turn.  Not only are the flying sequences absolutely stunning (helped by Slater's graceful presence), but the big-scale street sequence is still, for my money, one of the best &quot;live&quot; special effects sequences I've ever seen.  Superb.Congratulations to Anchor Bay too, for presenting such a great DVD of an overlooked movie.  From the THX sound to the excellent, vibrant picture, it's a top class job that many other companies would do well to learn from.  The animated menus also add a nice finishing touch, and the extras are also brilliantly researched, with a very interesting commentary, an impressive gallery of pictures, photos etc, and best of all, the original making of documentary (over 50 minutes long) which is one of the best makings of I've seen on a blockbuster movie.I can not recommend this Limited 2 disc DVD enough!!

They're all talented actors (some of them Oscar winners) and Helen Slater is very pretty and gives it her dead-level best in her first movie role. She was a fine choice to play Supergirl. She just did it in the wrong movie!The problem is an abysmally ham-handed, out-of-left-field, emotionally flat script that makes no logical sense whatsoever.

The film wasn't very well  received, and therefore no sequels resulted. In retrospect, the film's  major flaw is it's lack of direction(Jeannot Szwarc was a hack), and the  uniformly awful performances in the first half of the film. As the movie  progresses, it actually get's better, and the climactic scenes in the  Phantom Zone and Selina's fortress are actually exciting. The flying  sequences are the best in the ""Super"" series next to the first  ""Superman"" movie, and the effects are all quite good. The Anchor  Bay video is actually a dreadful transfer, though I'm sure that this has  more to do with source material than it does with thier efforts, as they  are usually very concerned with picture and sound quality. This has some  added footage that was not in the original American release print, and with  one exception(Nigel's blonde girlfriend should have stayed on the cutting  room floor), they improve the film.

175600,A19RAJY6R7USN0,1419828371,"Lee Neville ""emotionboy""","[3, 3]","In 1978 there came Superman, followed in 1980 by Superman II which was a direct continuance of the story. Superman and Superman II are the best when we think of the Superman movies. The attempted comedy of Superman III in 1983 was a disaster, and Superman IV The Quest For Peace in 1987 was a cheapo version, especially considering the disgustingly terrible special effects. Between Superman III and Superman IV, in 1984 there came Supergirl. Commercially it wasn't very successful and is often considered as one of the worst ever blockbusters, something which I didn't understand then, and really can't believe now. However, Supergirl has come to DVD and you're about to realize what you've been missing all this time.To cut a long story short, Superman's cousin Kara is on a mission on Earth to find the Omegahedron. The Omegahedron is the life source of Argo City, a place where those who survived the destruction of Krypton (where Superman was born) now live. The Omegahedron was lost in an accident caused by Kara. It got sucked out of Argo City into space and landed on Earth. Since it is her fault and all those who live in Argo City will die if she doesn't get the Omegahedron back soon, Kara is determined to return it. When Kara leaves Argo City in a small ship and lands on Earth she discovers she now has the same powers as Superman- she can fly, has superstrength, x-ray vision, heat vision, superhearing and superbreath. Unfortunately a witch has found the Omegehedron and is planning on using it's power to create an evil shadow over Earth in which she will rule. Since Superman is negotiating piece with an alien race several trillion light years away, Kara as Supergirl is the only the one who can save the planet.Supergirl starts off like Superman did with an introduction to the character and a story that begins to get you excited as we meet this new character. The opening credits themselves look fantastic and actually surpass the Superman opening credits. There is a real 3D effect to them, and the music by Jerry Goldsmith although not remembered now, is certainly on a par with John William's original Superman score. Helen Slater plays Supergirl and she is as much Supergirl as Christopher Reeve was Superman, perhaps even more so. Helen Slater has a perfect blend of innocence and strength, something which we only started to see in the late 1990s in shows such as Buffy The Vampire Slayer. Helen Slater is also beautiful, so making Supergirl beautiful. Supergirl basically becomes someone who can impress male audiences and be admired by female audiences. Faye Dunaway is the witch and although quite dull in comparison to Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor in the Superman movies, she does help the character of Supergirl to shine.The movie itself has plenty of action, yet is also endearing. There are comedic moments and a love interest. In 1984 audiences didn't give Supergirl a real chance, but now, you can.As for the DVD itself, it is a very impressive one from Anchor Bay. This Limited Edition version of Supergirl has 2 Discs and features 2 versions of the film. When Supergirl was released there were various complications regarding studios and distribution and so Supergirl ended up being cut several times. This also could have been responsible for how successful Supergirl was. The version shown in 1984 in US theatres is the shortest version and was released on video shortly afterwards. A while later when Supergirl was broadcast on television, some of the scenes that were cut were restored. It was also this version that was shown internationally. Disc 1 of the DVD features this international version of Supergirl. Recently in the UK, the original uncut version of Supergirl was discovered, and it is this which is the definitive director's version of Supergirl, now located on Disc 2.Disc 2 doesn't have any other extras except for this directors cut. Note that the sound is in mono and the picture is not THX mastered, but if you're a fan of this movie, this is a real find for you. Disc 1 has the international version which is THX mastered and in Dolby Digital 5.1. The Special Features include a Commentary by director Jeannot Szwarc (which probably should have been put on the Director's Cut but what the hey!) and expert Scott Bosco. There is also a 50 minute ""Making Of"" originally made at the time, and is done the way making ofs should be made today. In addition, there is an Extensive Booklet with interviews and photos which is fascinating, as well asTV Spots and trailers fron the US, the UK and Germany. I have to admit, the trailers are probably my favorite of the special features, apart from the making of, and the commentary....oh my god, there is just so much that is wonderful about this DVD set!I really recommend you buy it. And if you don't, hey I'm not bothered, I've got my copy already.",5,* * * * *This is how DVDs are supposed to be made!* * * * *,1048118400,"03 20, 2003",2003,4849,"['1978', 'came', 'Superman',

It's supposed to be fun-fantasy and who cares if there's holes in the plot and impossible acts occur? (e.g. wasn't Krypton blown apart years ago when Kal-El/Superman left it as an  infant? Que?? And how did Kara acquire that looks-superb-on-her  super-costume while traveling in her capsule?) Who expects believability  anyway? Enjoy what's there. Helen Slater is a drop-dead gorgeous Supergirl  and plays the fantastical part with dignity and the suitable naivete  expected of an alien visitor. She does a marvelous job with it. And yes,  Faye Dunaway overacts; I would think her part in such a flick required a  large helping of campy emoting as the powerful but somewhat klutzy witch  Selena. A lot of the fun was in the interaction between the quixotic Selena  and her Sancho Panza-like sidekick Bianca (Brenda Vaccaro, herself no  slouch at ironic comedy). Selena constantly pushing her new-found powers  beyond her own abilities to control, landing the two in mess after tangled  mess, accompanied by Bianca's timely snide cynicisms.

Supergirl was supposed to be the complimentary series to the Superman movies, but I guess we should be greatful that this one fell flat on its face at the first try rather than burning out like Superman IV.Boasting an all star cast, Supergirl left her inner space home (inside planet Earth?!) to find the BenWah ball (also called an Omega Headron) that she lost to restore her home city's energy.  Faye Dunaway, the villaness, comes across it and uses it to take over the earth.  She and her happy, bumbling fool of a side kick provide a few laughs, but don't have nearly the magic that Lex and Otis do in the Superman movies.  Faye Dunaway adds a camp aspect to it that makes one smile a bit, but her face was pulled so taught you could probably bounce a quarter off of it.  Supergirl goes the Clark Kent route, possing as Linda Lee with a Lay Lady Lay Lane roomie at prep school who just happens to be going out with Jimmy Olsen from the Daily Planet.  And that man they were fighting over?!?!  Ethan?!?!  I'd rather get into a fist fight over Eric Roberts.Something positive?

175619,A2Z9FXHC1L66EW,1419828371,"Mr. ""alan5973""","[47, 51]","Supergirl seems to grow on you after a while.  It's not the powerhouse that the first two Superman films were, but it definately has it's own unique story to tell.  Helen Slater does a very nice job in the title role.  She comes across as goodnatured, if not a bit naive since she knows very little about the people of Earth.  Catch Matt Frewer (Max Headroom, Honey I Shrunk The Kids) as one of the thugs who tries to take advantage of her when she first arrives.The interaction between Selena (a nicely wicked Faye Dunaway) and her friend Bionca (Brenda Vaccaro) make for some fun dialogue.  Just a couple of gals having fun and dabbling in black magic.  It's a nice bit of comic relief that fits quite nicely in the film....on the radio in one scene it is stated that Superman is off on another planet doing some diplomatic business and this is why he's not around.  Actually, Christopher Reeve was considering being in the film.  He would've been the one to show Supergirl around, and at the end, Supergirl would end up saving his life, but this would never come to pass after he decided not to be in the film.  But one of my favorite moments is when Kara (Slater) walks into Lucy Lane's dorm room and sees the poster of Superman on the wall and just slowly puts her hand on it.  I really liked that.I highly recommend you pick up this 2 Disc Set before it's no longer available.  Only 50,000 copies were made and once they're gone...they're gone.  And although a single disc version will remain available, what you lose on the 2nd disc is the director's cut which adds on an additional 15 minutes of footage that rounds out more of the story and character development, paticularly, Jimmy Olsen (Marc McClure) and Lucy Lane (Maureen Teefy)'s relationship.I was somewhat surprised when Supergirl came out on DVD before any of the Superman films did.  I was also disappointed that, with the exception of the first Superman movie, none of the sequels contained any additional scenes or extra features.  Kind of makes me wish Anchor Bay had the rights to these films.  Then they'd all be 2 disc Collector's editions like Supergirl.  Even Superman: The Movie isn't a 2 Disc Set.  Instead, Warner Brothers used both sides of one DVD, so it can't have any cover art like all the other films.  Supergirl actually has the most impressive packaging.  A nice two box snap case, with cover art on both DVDs as well as a nifty 16 page booklet that gives you more information.The extras on Supergirl rival the extras on Superman: The Movie.  In fact I'd say if it wasn't for the fact that Superman contains 3 retrospective documentaries and an isolated music score, Supergirl would beat it hands down.  The featurette, hosted by Faye Dunaway is an hour long and is very enjoyable to watch.  You get all the trailers (U.S. and Foreign) and U.S. TV spots, storyboards, still & poster galleries of some very nice artwork.  This stuff should've been on the Superman DVDs.  Anchor Bay has outdone themselves and put Warner Brothers to shame at the same time.  So check this out, it's worth every penny and will become a collector's item, once all initial copies are sold.Supergirl: a girl's story of the most exciting kind!",4,"Great 2Disc Set,Wish The Superman Sequels Got This Treatment",994032000,"07 2, 2001",2001,3207,"['Supergirl', 'grow', 'while', 'not', 'powerhouse', 'first', 'two', 'Superman', 'films', 'were', 'definately', 'own', 'unique', 'story', 'tell', 'Helen', 'Slater', 'very', 'nice', 'job', 'title', 'role', 'goodnatured', 'not', 'bit', 'naive', 'very', 'little', 'people', 'Earth', 'Catch', 'Matt', 'Frewer', 'Max', 'Headroom', 'Honey', 'Shrunk', 'Kids', 'one', 'thugs', 'who', 'take', 'advantage', 'when', 'first', 'interaction', 'Selena', 'nicely', 'wicked', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'friend', 'Bionca', 'Brenda', 'Vaccaro', 'make', 'fun', 'dialogue', 'Just', 'couple', 'gals', 'having', 'fun', 'dabbling', 'black', 'magic', 'nice', 'bit', 'comic', 'relief', 'quite', 'nicely', 'film', 'radio', 'one', 'scene', 'stated', 'Superman', 'off', 'planet', 'doing', 'diplomatic', 'business', 'why', 'not', 'around', 'Actually', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'was', 'considering', 'being', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'one', 'show', 'Supergirl', 'end', 'Supergirl', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'saving', 'life', 'would', 'never', 'come', 'pass', 'decided', 'not', 'be', 'film', 'one', 'favorite', 'moments', 'when', 'Kara', 'Slater', 'Lucy', 'Lane', 'dorm', 'room', 'poster', 'Superman', 'wall', 'just', 'slowly', 'hand', 'really', 'liked', 'that.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'pick', 'up', '2', 'Disc', 'Set', 'no', 'longer', 'available', 'Only', '50,000', 'copies', 'were', 'made', 'once', ""'re"", 'gone', ""'re"", 'gone', 'single', 'disc', 'version', 'will', 'remain', 'available', 'what', 'lose', '2nd', 'disc', 'director', 'cut', 'additional', '15', 'minutes', 'footage', 'out', 'more', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'paticularly', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'Marc', 'McClure', 'Lucy', 'Lane', 'Maureen', 'Teefy', 'relationship.I', 'was', 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'when', 'Supergirl', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'Superman', 'films', 'did', 'was', 'also', 'disappointed', 'exception', 'first', 'Superman', 'movie', 'none', 'sequels', 'contained', 'additional', 'scenes', 'extra', 'features', 'Kind', 'wish', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'had', 'rights', 'films', 'Then', ""'d"", 'be', '2', 'disc', 'Collector', 'editions', 'Supergirl', 'Even', 'Superman', 'Movie', ""n't"", '2', 'Disc', 'Set', 'Instead', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'used', 'sides', 'one', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'cover', 'art', 'other', 'films', 'Supergirl', 'actually', 'most', 'impressive', 'packaging', 'nice', 'two', 'box', 'snap', 'case', 'cover', 'art', 'DVDs', 'as', 'well', 'nifty', '16', 'page', 'booklet', 'more', 'information.The', 'extras', 'Supergirl', 'rival', 'extras', 'Superman', 'Movie', 'fact', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'fact', 'Superman', '3', 'retrospective', 'documentaries', 'isolated', 'music', 'score', 'Supergirl', 'would', 'beat', 'down', 'featurette', 'hosted', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'hour', 'long', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'get', 'trailers', 'U.S.', 'Foreign', 'U.S.', 'TV', 'spots', 'storyboards', 'still', 'poster', 'galleries', 'very', 'nice', 'artwork', 'stuff', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Superman', 'DVDs', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'outdone', 'put', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'shame', 'same', 'time', 'So', 'check', 'out', 'worth', 'penny', 'will', 'become', 'collector', 'item', 'once', 'initial', 'copies', 'are', 'sold.Supergirl', 'girl', 'story', 'most', 'exciting', 'kind']",N/A

He does a great job of it though.Helen Slater in the title role, and in her first major role appearance is not too bad, but in facts of acting, she is not a young Katherine Hepburn (although I doubt that Kathy would have accepted such a role to start with).Faye Dunaway and Brenda Vaccaro do their very best to keep straight faces, while playing modern day ""would-be"" witches, trying to unleash the power of an object that Supergirl herself stole (or borrowed, as she states).The story is weak and absolutely not to compare with the rest of the Superman movies, unless we take the last two incarnations (a mixture of Superman III and Superman IV perhaps).But then again, what can one expect from cartoon characters?Perhaps a touch of X-Men treatment?Perhaps.A bit more fleshed-out characters would have been in order. We actually know nothing of value of the characters shown. They-re just here.Where have they come from, what are their backgrounds, where are they planning to go?No one is really allowed any true insight in these facts.They are just there to do what they were supposed to do all along.So where's the thrill?

Then perhaps, I would have included her growing up and a chance meeting with her adolescent cousin Clark Kent/Superman, either in the Fortress of Solitude or at his foster parent's farm.But this was obviously too much to ask.Instead we are treated to a pure campy and at times idiotic cartoon-like movie, flat as can be and as uninventive as can come.Not even the Director's cut, which I also own, indeed Jeannot Szwarc's very vision and take on the movie could do it justice.The DVD comes as stated in the uncut and unrated European theatrical version (that doesn't mean that it is in PAL or Region 2 format, NO.

I personally like the way the actress represented the girl of steel. I also think that Kara knew Superman was Clark Kent because most comic versions of Super girl at that time had Argo city monitoring Superman activities on earth. As for Selena and the phantom zone black magic would be best guest.The story deals with Kara who follows the Omega Hebran to Earth which Selena and would be witch finds and taps into it power to become a sorcorress surpreme. Having come from a Heavenly utopia like Argo city it is natural for her character to see the good in people more than the bad and have a sunny peronality. She takes up the identity of Linda Lee (Clark Kent cousin) at a boarding school of trouble makers which like in the silver age comics uses her powers to help students in need. With Superman off world the character of Jimmy Olsen from Superman films of the time make a guest appearance as does Lois Lane's sister. I'm still unclear why Jimmy can't dye his hair red to match his comic book characters. Seems women always dye for their movie parts but men never do.  As super girl tries to find what she searches for she falls in love with the same Earth man that Selena wants for her own. There a power struggle as and Selena sends Super girl into a phantom zone more nightmarish than the one seen in Superman 2 movie.  She escapes; stops Selena and return home with her prize.some people who see this movie might find it corny or campy (whatever the current term is) but one must remember that this is how silver age super heroes and heroines were like. I would take Helen Slater's super girl to the hot tempered ill manner one from Smallville TV series any time.

Ever since I was little, Christopher Reeve was and I'm sure is everyone's favorite Superman, and that same feeling applied to Helen Slater as Supergirl! Like Reeve is Superman to all of us, Helen was Supergirl(the very first one also) to all of us! Even though there is the scene with Helen looking at a poster of Chris Reeve, I always wished they could have worked together, and I have to wonder if they have even meet each other personally! Though I grant that the movie should have made more sense to all of us, I for one label it as my all-time favorite movie because scenes were restored totally than on the VHS, and one of my favorites was a scene between Marc McClure and Maureen Teefy who are held captive in Dunaway's castle! I think the DVD special edition added more layer to Slater's character! What's really great was the making of the movie special they included along with the original theatrical trailers!

In an effort to set this one apart from the Superman series, the filmmakers tried to make this one more about a magical enemy, rather than the more Sci Fi aspect of the Superman movies. Magic had already been introduced into the comics as a force that could harm the Super clan, but it becomes a bit tricky to portray it on the big screen without losing your audience.The villainess and her assistant have little charisma, which already places them below Lex Luthor in the minds of the audience. This is one of the large problems that plagued Superman III. Of course it doesn't help that the main thrust of Serlena's ""evil plan"" for most of the movie seems to revolve around getting a hunky construction worker to fall in love with her.When the spell accidentally causes him to fall for Supergirl's human guise, Linda, Serlena decides to start the catfight to end all catfights. Or that's what it seems like. There's little sense that there is a real threat for Supergirl to fight except for the attacks  against herself. Superman and Supergirl work best when the fight they are in is for more than their own lives. We just don't get a sense that that is happening here.Other than that, the effects are not terrible, but the fight at the end with the force of shadows is a bit obscurely filmed. It comes across as a bit confusing.In truth, the world is actually in danger because Serlena has been using the Omegahedron to increase her powers exponentially, but it doesn't come across like that.It's better than Superman IV (big deal) and it may be roughly on par with Superman III, but that can largely rely on your personal preferences in this matter.",3,Supergirl?

R.,"[17, 18]","It is safe to assume that I have never been fond of this movie, but I decided to check out this release after hearing it was packed with extras that Superman fans should not miss.  Much to my surprise, I was glued to my TV for hours simply going through all of the bonus features!  There is the 1984 'Making of Supergirl' one hour documentary, which chronicles everything from day 1.  Then there are several TV spots, domestic and foreign trailers (these are fun, especially the German one), storyboard art, talent bios, and tons of color and black & white stills from the movie.  In addition to all of this, there is a neat 16 page color booklet which reprints some of the original promotional movie tie-ins like contests and games.  I can't believe somebody actually managed to dig all of this up!The movie itself is a nice, crisp transfer with 5.1 digital surround sound.  The audio commentary by the director and the special project consultant is among the most informative and fun I have ever listened to.  The consultant manages to get the somewhat wooden director to reveal a lot of tidbits likeChristopher Reeve's proposed cameo and the reasons behind why and how they created so many of the special effects and set pieces.  To its credit, this film performs much better as a major motion picture after viewing the 138 minute director's cut included on disc 2 and seeing the original intent of the filmmakers.  Cutting out a half-hour of footage from any movie is bound to affect the flow of the plot and characterization.  Anchor Bay Entertainment should be commended for taking a widely panned movie and giving it the VIP treatment, proving irrefutably that it is possible to produce a great DVD for an under-appreciated movie.",4,Much Better in Hindsight,989020800,"05 5, 2001",2001,1737,"['safe', 'assume', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'fond', 'movie', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'release', 'hearing', 'was', 'packed', 'extras', 'Superman', 'fans', 'should', 'not', 'miss', 'Much', 'surprise', 'was', 'glued', 'TV', 'hours', 'simply', 'going', 'bonus', '1984', ""'Making"", 'Supergirl', 'one', 'hour', 'documentary', 'everything', 'day', '1', 'Then', 'are', 'several', 'TV', 'spots', 'domestic', 'foreign', 'trailers', 'are', 'fun', 'especially', 'German', 'one', 'storyboard', 'art', 'talent', 'bios', 'tons', 'color', 'black', 'white', 'stills', 'movie', 'addition', 'neat', '16', 'page', 'color', 'booklet', 'original', 'promotional', 'movie', 'tie-ins', 'contests', 'games', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'somebody', 'actually', 'managed', 'dig', 'up', 'movie', 'nice', 'crisp', 'transfer', '5.1', 'digital', 'surround', 'sound', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'special', 'project', 'consultant', 'most', 'informative', 'fun', 'have', 'ever', 'listened', 'consultant', 'get', 'somewhat', 'wooden', 'director', 'reveal', 'lot', 'tidbits', 'Reeve', 'proposed', 'cameo', 'reasons', 'why', 'how', 'created', 'so', 'many', 'special', 'effects', 'set', 'pieces', 'credit', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'viewing', '138', 'minute', 'director', 'cut', 'included', 'disc', '2', 'seeing', 'original', 'intent', 'filmmakers', 'Cutting', 'out', 'half-hour', 'footage', 'movie', 'bound', 'affect', 'flow', 'plot', 'characterization', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Entertainment', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'taking', 'widely', 'panned', 'movie', 'giving', 'VIP', 'treatment', 'proving', 'irrefutably', 'possible', 'produce', 'great', 'DVD', 'under-appreciated', 'movie']",N/A

Interesting, seeing as WB abandoned the film as a whole during its 1984 theatrical release.The film is virtually the same transfer of the international version as used on the Anchor Bay release, along with the commentary track by Bosco and Szwarc. (Interestingly, WB uses the famed John Williams Superman theme on the menu screens, despite the theme not being used in the film.)The film was one of the most underappreciated entries of 1984, but is really worth watching, and only in the famed ""international version"", and not in the heavily butchered theatrical version, which will hopefully never see the light of day on DVD ever.  The film focuses heavily on fantasy aspects, with most of the Sci-fi aspects that made the whole Superman franchise.All in all, this DVD as a whole allows WB to make amends for giving up on this film before it ever got out of the gate.  Hopefully, WB can go in when we see the next round of DVD tie-ins in 09 when the next Superman movie comes out, and revisit this film and even give us the ""Director's Cut"" with a more wider release than the utterly expensive and limited edition that Anchor Bay gave us.",5,"It took 22 years, but........",1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,1270,"['.it', 'was', 'good', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'finally', 'release', 'Supergirl', 'own', 'label', 'being', 'previously', 'released', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Interesting', 'seeing', 'WB', 'abandoned', 'film', 'whole', '1984', 'theatrical', 'release.The', 'film', 'virtually', 'same', 'transfer', 'international', 'version', 'used', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'release', 'commentary', 'track', 'Bosco', 'Szwarc', 'Interestingly', 'WB', 'famed', 'John', 'Williams', 'Superman', 'theme', 'menu', 'screens', 'theme', 'not', 'being', 'used', 'film', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'underappreciated', 'entries', '1984', 'really', 'worth', 'watching', 'only', 'famed', 'international', 'version', 'not', 'heavily', 'butchered', 'theatrical', 'version', 'will', 'hopefully', 'never', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'DVD', 'ever', 'film', 'heavily', 'fantasy', 'aspects', 'most', 'Sci-fi', 'aspects', 'made', 'whole', 'Superman', 'franchise.All', 'DVD', 'whole', 'WB', 'make', 'amends', 'giving', 'up', 'film', 'ever', 'got', 'gate', 'Hopefully', 'WB', 'can', 'go', 'when', 'see', 'next', 'round', 'DVD', 'tie-ins', '09', 'when', 'next', 'Superman', 'movie', 'out', 'revisit', 'film', 'even', 'give', 'Director', 'Cut', 'more', 'wider', 'release', 'utterly', 'expensive', 'limited', 'edition', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'gave']",N/A

I didn't get to see it when I was a kid and it was in theaters and just never got around to seeing it before now, but now that I have, I'm glad I did. I've been a long time fan of Supergirl. I still collect her comics.This movie is not as bad as I thought it was going to be, but it does have some issues. They took a campy approach with the villain, played by Faye Dunaway, and no matter how hard I try, I just can't see anything but Mommy Dearest, Joan Crawford in her performance.However, this IS based on a comic book, after all and we should remember that. Comics have all sorts of outrageous storylines. Why would we expect any less from a comic book based movie? Why do we expect comic based movies to be so different than what they're based on?Helen Slater did a great job in my opinion. She captured Supergirl's innocence and immaturity and her serious, ""never smile"" mannerism. She looks like she stepped out of some of my comics.I wish that somebody would bring Supergirl back to the movies, but this time, using modern CGI. So much of the issues with this movie have to do with the cheesy special effects. Though the flying scenes are fairly well done and Helen Slater managed to capture Supergirl's famous postures well, the rest of the spfx are really dated.The costumes and wig work are very good. Slater looks like Linda from my Superman Family comics of the 1970's with her brown hairstyle, and Faye Dunaway has some fantastic costumes. I love the costume for Supergirl. It was very well done. Her hair was great, too.All in all, this movie is much better than Superman 3 or 4 and this franchise has a lot of potential. I don't know why it wasn't done over in more recent years or why they didn't follow this one up with another.No, its not perfect. Faye Dunaway's character could have been a bad guy on the cheesy Batman show of the 1960's, but unlike that show, where Batman and Robin were very campy themselves, Slater tried to more or less play it straight and I actually didn't find it that hard to accept her right from the time she got on Earth.If you're still undecided, rent a copy first.

I aleady knew it was a mediocre story with painfully corny characters and dialog. But what really struck me this time was the sheer uselessness of Supergirl.Time after time, in every Supergirl scene, she proved her worthlessness. A rampaging truck tears through a town? Only Supergirl can stop it! But lets sit around and watch it first. We've got to let it destroy half the town before we do anything, at least!(Hmmm... Some fire about to blow up the gas station? Think, Supergirl! Think HARD! ""Uh, let's go destroy the town's water tower. That might help."" No, Supergirl, no. You have freezing breath, remember? Ah, forget it.)Or an invisible monster comes toward her, destroying everything in its path. Would have been kind of nice if she had stopped it before it tore up the lawn too bad, you know? Instead, she stand and stares at it. She's good at that, if anything. Standing and staring. Of course I don't mind looking at her, but still...And then there's the times when the ""cute dude"" gets kidnapped and abused - again and again... Seems like it would be a good time for Supergirl to do something about it, right? She seems strangely inept for the job. When she finally does rescue him - from some evil bumper cars, no less - He immediately gets assaulted by a coconut. She even sees it coming! But instead of using her super speed, or even telling the guy ""heads up!"", she opts for standing by helplessly. While the nut hits him on the head, splitting his skull open and leaving him to die a slow, painful, lingering death- (Oops! My bad. Just dreamin' for a moment there. That particular actor survives this movie, unfortunately. He doesn't die until Hans Gruber shoots him in the first Die Hard, for which I am grateful. Thank you, Hans!)I think you get my point, but I've got to mention the whole ""walk into the enemy lair and get trapped in the phantom zone"" routine, as if she couldn't have seen that coming! (Okay, to be fair maybe she couldn't. But I'm on a roll here!) But the final point was when she was getting threatened by the floor collapsing beneath her. Uh, hello? You're Supergirl? You can FLY, remember? Fly girl, fly!Oh well. It was still nice at the end, when she finished off the bad guy with- what? A whirlwind? I didn't quite get that. But whatever. All's well that ended well. And an enjoyable popcorn flick it was.I know others have already mentioned it, but Helen Slater is super-hot, for sure. I liked watching her, even if the script she was given was painful at times. Also, Faye Dunaway made for a great villain. And she was pretty darn hot, too.

Zaltar (Peter O'Toole) was observing Earth from the city for quite a while, so it is only logical that as she hung around him, she too would learn of Earth, and of Clark Kent.As to her &quot;magically&quot; changing, well, I guess for time consideration, and it was a trick used in the other Superman movies that worked, so why not here?I must admit that the absence of Christopher Reeve as Superman in the movie is what bothered me, and I bet that the movie would have been made differently of Chris were available to appear. In the early comics, Superman was very much her mentor, guiding and shaping her into what she had become, but in this the absence of Superman made for a different story. [BTW: His absence is explained as him being on some mission on an alien planet.]Looks wise, they did pick the right girl to play her, Helen Slater is an extremely attractive woman, and did make that costume look quite nice on her and handled the flying sequences quite wonderfully.If you watch the Director's cut, the movie is watchable, don't forget the American Version was only around 92 minutes long; and the Director's cut was 138 minutes long hey, we're talking about over 45 minutes -- almost one forth of the movie!

When you think about it, 50,000 copies isn't very many for the world.  Yet, why are there still copies left to buy?  Simple answer - the movie was garbage.  I saw the international version back in 1984 which was supposed to make more sense than the butchered US theatrical version, but the movie still stunk! Don't get me wrong, I admire Anchor Bay for releasing titles on DVD that perhaps the big companies prefer not to, but Supergirl is a very bad movie.  it should have been kept at the bottom of the vaults marked &quot;never to be seen again in anyone's lifetime&quot;.  Back in 1984, when we sat through the international version it ran for a whopping 124 minutes! I always prefer to let a movie run its entire length to give it a chance.  By the end of it, I wish I hadn't.  It was a silly storyline.  It ruined Fay Dunaway's career, and didn't do anything to help Helen Slater's new career (at the time the movie was tipped to make her a huge star). I fortunately won't be buying this DVD.

It's like having a duplicate Leonardo Da Vinci art  piece except with a little tear at the sides. Thank you so much.The DVD  version would have gotta 5 stars if not for some inconsistence with the  remastering.  Firstly the sound seems to be not consistent in certain  scenes like the Flying Ballet. Very loud then suddenly soft.  Secondly, the  pictures on some scenes were very dark as if the lights suddenly went dim.  Thirdly the graphics on the Menu selections were a disaster. The movie  itself has been mocked by others as being too comical, with none of the  strength you would see in a Superman movie. The colours used were so  striking that you can probably see the menu from 50 miles away. I rather  they had stick with black and white.Now the good side, overall the DVD  was well done. I could hear every bang and swash due to the THX  remastering. The pictures (almost all crystal clear) is 10 times more  superior to the VHS version that I have seen. The best part of this  collection is the 2nd disc with the director's cut and the extras added it,  it really paints a better and more complete story.Those of you who wants  a decent movie story about Supergirl.
