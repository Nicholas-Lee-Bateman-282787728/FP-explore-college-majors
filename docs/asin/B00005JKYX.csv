592658,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00005JKYX,,"[3, 3]","After two successful movies, ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"", that featured their classic monster from Hollywood's yesteryear, Universal Pictures opted to go in a different direction for the next installment in the franchise by attempting to create a spin-off with ""The Scorpion King"". To me, the decision seemed, and most likely was, simply an attempt from Universal to make more money on a successful franchise, and not really produce much of anything that would further the storyline established in the previous two movies. Since this movie was apparently rushed into production directly after ""The Mummy Returns"" wrapped, I thought I was probably right in the whole ""cash cow"" approach Universal was taking with the movie, and that we were going to be left with a well-below average movie, and the franchise would most likely suffer a quick, yet painful death because of it.""The Scorpion King"" is the story of an Akkadian assassin named Mathayus (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson), who vows to avenge his brother's murder at the hands of an undefeated warlord (Steven Brand). To complete his quest for vengeance and fulfill his destiny as foretold in a prophecy stating that Mathayus will become the desert-ruling Scorpion King, he must join forces with a beautiful, yet dangerous sorceress (Kelly Hu), and a rival Nubian warrior (Michael Clarke Duncan). With their tentative partnership, Mathayus and company are in for the fight of their lives as they take on the warlord's massive army in hopes of toppling his oppressive rule.Even though I had plenty of doubts about this movie, as did most critics, the film turned out to be not all that bad, and even managed a moderate box office return. While not up to par with either of the previous two films in the series, ""The Scorpion King"" does an adequate job of providing an entertaining, somewhat campy, and extremely coincidental back-story for the character. The writing was average, which fits in perfectly with the rest of the movie's various aspects, i.e. acting, fight scenes, dialogue, etc. Some of the dialogue was a little too modernized for me, showing that the team of writers was obviously not wanting to create any semblance of historical accuracy with the movie, which I didn't expect to find a whole lot here anyhow. The humor was hit-and-miss this time around, not nearly as polished in execution or quality as its predecessors had been, and at times went far too campy to achieve laughs that some of the comedic situations became more annoying than humorous.Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson (""Walking Tall""), who is no stranger to choreographed fighting due to his time spent with WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment), obviously has no trouble handling the action scenes and making them entertaining for the audience. Along with his aptitude for fighting, Johnson also showed that he had some acting chops, plenty of onscreen charisma, and a seemingly good sense of humor; in essence, the future skills of another Hollywood action hero was being honed and developed with this movie. Michael Clarke Duncan (""Daredevil"") shows up in an essentially one-note performance as a rival warrior and eventual comrade to Mathayus. I was disappointed that Michael wasn't given more to do in this movie, I mean a little more expansion could have been done in regards to the adversarial relationship between his character, Balthazar, and Mathayus; instead, it's just lightly touched upon and is over with almost as quickly as it began. The other cast members were good in their roles, nothing outstanding or truly noteworthy. Actress Kelly Hu provides the obligatory eye candy for the predominantly male audience and cast, as the warlord's seductive sorceress. I have yet to see what Kelly's range as an actress is as she is given little more to do here than she had been given as the essentially mute villain Lady Deathstrike in ""X2: X-Men United"". So, I really can't say if we've seen the extent of Kelly's talents or not, but for some reason Hollywood likes her, so I would think that there must be some level of talent here; although this is the same town that has a fascination with Hayden Christensen, who has proven time and again that he is not a good actor no matter how hard he tries.The action sequences in ""The Scorpion King"", which are many in number, relied much more on physical stunts, wirework, and good ol' fashioned fight choreography than either of the previous two movies had done. In ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"" much of the action was very CGI oriented, with some wirework being done, and a lot of the fights involved gunplay; however, given this story's timeframe being set much earlier in world history, all the action is done with mostly swords and bows and arrows, giving a much more up close and personal feel to all of the fighting. Most of the stunts were well done, although fairly far-fetched much of the time, generally not to the point that it was distracting from the movie; but, there were a few instances where I thought the stunts had gone too far over-the-top that the director, Chuck Russell (""Eraser""), could have shown some restraint and attempted to ground the film in some semblance of our reality.""The Scorpion King"" is a decent spin-off, something Hollywood is rarely good at achieving, that creates an entertaining, albeit far-fetched, back-story to an intriguing character that was introduced all too briefly in ""The Mummy Returns"". Fairly good acting, fun action sequences, and an average story help to make ""The Scorpion King"" a moderately entertaining piece of movie fluff that will do nothing to impress you, but will provide you with a brief escape from the real world.""The Scorpion King"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sensuality.",4,A Moderately Entertaining Spin-off...,1146096000,"04 27,

I rushed out to buy the DVD when it came out in order to support it, because I love ancient movies with a good mix of cultures in it.Over time it began to lose its luster. I won't go into the details of what the movie is about, but the problems I had with it.1) The deleted scenes on the DVD made the film more unstandable and leaving them out hurts the movie. I didn't like how on the DVD you couldn't access the deleted scenes as a part of the movie. Instead you access them, by clicking a button when an image of a sword pops up. After you view the scene you are taken back to an earlier scene instead of just continuing.2) I feel that the story line is a bit weak, and over time it becomes boring. There should have been more intrigue in the story. The whole idea of a sorceress who can see the future, but is held prisoner seems illogical to me.3) The movie was missing one of those real epic army vs. army battle scenes, that I was expecting based on the Mummy Returns movie where the Scorpion King is introduced.Seeing that this movie has been out for a while, I doubt that most people now will find it very entertaining.

After viewing the movie I can not say I was not entertained to some degree or totally disappointed with the flick. Aside for some major flaws in the plot and historical reality, the movie was watchable.  I feel I must point out the flaws as I always do and two of the largest lay on the shoulders of the Villain played by Steven Brand. Why on earth would the director and casting allow a British actor to present his lines in native accent? Hugo Weaving (agent Smith) did not do it in `The Matrix,' why would Steven Brand do it here? Second, in one scene, he used a French phrase, this a language not born until the seventh century.  C'est plus qu'un crime, c'est une faute.Overall, like its sister series `The Mummy' and ' The Mummy Returns,' this DVD is full of interesting extras and vignettes worth watching.  However, the feature lacks intelligent dialogue, is tainted with twenty-first century humor and all the CG special effects could have spent more time rendering in the computers (the snakes were ridiculous and half the ants were missing shadows).

When the evil ruler Memnon kills Mathays's brother hes really out for revenge. There was some cheesiness to this movie So I'm warning you its a movie you'll either love it or you don't.

I put this DVD in on a rainy, cold Saturday because there was nothing on TV and I was curious to see if it was any good.  I will admit it held my interest until the end; mainly because it isn't that long, thank goodness.  As I expected, it is a very violent, blood-and-guts movie but it does have its humorous side as well.  The Rock stars as Mathayus, a warrior of ancient times who is hired, along with his brother, to kill a sorceress (Kelly Hu).  His brother is captured and murdered and Mathayus swears revenge against his brother's killer, Balthazar.  Mathayus sneaks into Balthazar's camp to kill him, the attempt is thwarted and Mathayus escapes with the beautiful sorceress as his hostage.  Along the way the warrior manages to acquire some comic relief in the form of Grant Heslov and later enlists the aid of a supposed enemy, Michael Clark Duncan.  The movie is pretty predictable at this point as you just know Mathayus and the sorceress are falling in love.  What held my interest was how the story was going to end as far as who would live and who would die.  I won't ruin it by telling you.I wasn't sure about The Rock's acting ability but he is talented and he does have pretty good comic timing.  He also is very easy on the eyes - that helps.  This was a mildly entertaining movie and I am glad I watched it but it's not a film that I would watch a second time.  Once is enough.  The other actors are good in this film and I couldn't find fault with Kelly Hu's performance as some others did.

And other than in the brief flashback scenes in the Mummy movies, there hasn't been much in the way of Big Screen swords and sorcery since Arnold Schwarzenegger retired Conan after just two movies back in the 1980's. But this flick should have revived the dormant genre, as it turns out to be a fun 'put your brain in neutral' timekiller. Johnson is up to the game here, with his bulging frame and insouciant attitude. Director Chuck Russell has experience putting large men through action paces, having helmed the Schwarzenegger vehicle Eraser, among others. The setup is simple in the extreme, an advantage in this kind of movie: a brief pre-credits sequence introduces Our Hero, then a quick setup to show us the bad guy, an evil king named Memnon (Steven Brand). After that it's just a matter of watching and enjoying as  The Rock hacks and slashes his way through myriad henchman to get to the baddie. Director Russell uses his budget and digital effects well, with an impressively visual ancient desert land. There's a few too many modern anachronisms in the dialogue, but that seems to be true in all recent period movies (A Knight's Tale and The Count of Monte Cristo are two such examples) and though a bit annoying, it doesn't seriously mar the movie. Add in some fun supporting actors, like Michael Clarke Duncan (Armageddon) as a  Rock rival forced to team up with him, and you've got a fine bit of entertainment for those so inclined.  Check it out! Also with Kelly Hu (X2), Grant Heslov (True Lies) and Ralf Moeller (TV`s Conan).",3,Saving the ancient world with one raised eyebrow...,1238544000,"04 1, 2009",2009,1752,"['Scorpion', 'King', '2002', 'putting', 'brief', 'appearance', 'lackluster', 'sequel', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'wrestling', 'superstar', 'Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'ancient', 'warrior', 'character', 'spin-off', 'movie', 'other', 'brief', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'Mummy', 'movies', ""n't"", 'been', 'much', 'way', 'Big', 'Screen', 'swords', 'sorcery', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'retired', 'Conan', 'just', 'two', 'movies', 'back', '1980', 'flick', 'should', 'have', 'revived', 'dormant', 'genre', 'out', 'be', 'fun', 'brain', 'neutral', 'timekiller', 'Johnson', 'up', 'game', 'here', 'bulging', 'frame', 'insouciant', 'attitude', 'Director', 'Chuck', 'Russell', 'experience', 'putting', 'large', 'men', 'action', 'paces', 'having', 'helmed', 'Schwarzenegger', 'vehicle', 'Eraser', 'others', 'setup', 'simple', 'extreme', 'advantage', 'kind', 'movie', 'brief', 'pre-credits', 'sequence', 'introduces', 'Hero', 'then', 'quick', 'setup', 'show', 'bad', 'guy', 'evil', 'king', 'named', 'Memnon', 'Steven', 'Brand', 'just', 'matter', 'watching', 'enjoying', 'Rock', 'hacks', 'slashes', 'way', 'myriad', 'henchman', 'get', 'baddie', 'Director', 'Russell', 'budget', 'digital', 'effects', 'well', 'impressively', 'visual', 'ancient', 'desert', 'land', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'modern', 'anachronisms', 'dialogue', 'be', 'true', 'recent', 'period', 'movies', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'Count', 'Monte', 'Cristo', 'are', 'two', 'such', 'examples', 'bit', 'annoying', ""n't"", 'seriously', 'mar', 'movie', 'Add', 'fun', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'Armageddon', 'Rock', 'rival', 'forced', 'team', 'up', ""'ve"", 'got', 'fine', 'bit', 'entertainment', 'so', 'inclined', 'Check', 'out', 'Also', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'X2', 'Grant', 'Heslov', 'True', 'Lies', 'Ralf', 'Moeller', 'TV', 's', 'Conan']",The Scorpion King

I'm a wrestling fan as well, I like the entertainment value of it but, thats not going to blind me from criticizing this movie for lacking good content. First off, is this movie supposed to a serious action flick like Conan? I think not. It seemed that it was trying to be Similar to Indiana Jones with the occasional comedic skits along with the action however, at least Indiana Jones put some Historical Perspective along with a serious overtone to its story unlike this film which lacks that type of continuaty. None of the characters, scenery, or props are believable in this film. It all seems like a water down version of Indiana Jones. Overall this movie lacks an identity of the genre it wants to belong to.

As I watched, I was surprised to find that I was thouroughly enjoying it. Based on a character introduced in The Mummy Returns, The Scorpion King is a prequel of sorts, giving some of the back story of the Scorpion King, Mathyus, and his rise to power. There are several historical mistakes, such as having wagons with wheels when the wheel hadn't been invented yet, but this doesn't detract from the fun of the film. The Rock, in his feature-film starring role debut, makes a good impression, as his lack of acting experience not being a hindrance in an action film. He delivers his lines well enough, and fills the screen with his larger-than-life presence. The rest of the cast is solid, but a bit wasted with the spare script. Bernard Hill, in particular, seems out of place here. I suppose I still connect him with his role as the heroic King Theoden in the Lord of the Rings films. Sometimes the actors seem to have some trouble keeping a straight face while delivering some of the somewhat silly lines they must deliver, but the film has enough action to more than make up for it.

The opening sequence was incredible - Matthias rescues his brother from the evil horde of crooked-teeth-folks single handedly.  The bow that fires five arrows at once and knocks the people halfway across their camp was just what I was hoping to see.  Unfortunately this same type of action is really not repeated later in the movie, it tends to get more realistic (hah, I feel ashamed for saying that, but note the use of the word more).

They vaguely hint this movie is connected to the Mummy films, but basically the name Scorpion King is all they have in common. When they announced they were doing a remake of the Mummy, I groaned as remakes are usually the pits you think why did they bother, but was pleasantly thrilled with the results. It was wonderful!! I own both Mummy movies on DVD and play them often, for they are movies that can be view again and again and one never tires of them.The Problem with this film???? What made the Mummy films so perfect and the Scorpion King just miss?? I think it is because of Brendan Fraser. He is a powerhouse talent, that is super action star, but his marvellous humour, funny voices and true screen presence, backed with the wonderful Hallam as a foil,makes the Mummy movies work and work well.Scorpion King draws on the same rich texture, the expensive sets and computer work, that made the Mummy movies so opulent. The Rock is a great action star with a bankable presence in Conan the Barbarian vein, but the movie lacks the sharp repartee, wit, heart and dry humour of the first two films and suffers because of it. The action is nearly nonstop, it is wonderfully staged, but there is so much missing.I enjoyed the film and liked the alternative scenes and other bonus selections, but basically, a wee tad sorry I went ahead and bought the DVD solely because I enjoyed them Mummy films. While they will continued to get use, I fear Scorpion Kings is more of a once a year film and will gather dust.The action is great, the costumes and staging on par with the Mummy films...but I hear Peggy Lee singing in the background....is that all there is....???If you have seen the film before and wish to own a copy, you will be thrilled with the DVD version. The sounds and film quality is super, the bonus goodies great. But do not buy this film on the rep of the two mummy films or you might be disappoint, see it first!I am sure The Rock and his OTT WWF charm will see him a huge action star.

592700,A2WP0GOTX13MG4,B00005JKYX,"DJK ver 2.0 ""Reader and Movie Buff""","[1, 1]","The DVD release of 'The Scorpion King' is what the DVD format is all about:  a movie and plenty of extra features.  'The Scorpion King' score high on both accounts.First, the movie.  The Rock, a.k.a. Dwayne Johnson, plays Mathayus, one of the last survivors of a clan of assassins.  The movie opens with Mathayus's brother being held captive by another band of cutthroats.  Mathayus dutifully rescues him in over-the-top-action style, and wraps up the scene with a nice Scwarzeneggeresque one liner.  Then it is on to the prologue, where we learn that Memnon, the greatest known swordsman and played by Steven Brand, leads an army bent on conquering all.  At his side is a beautiful sorceress capable of predicting the outcome of any battle.  Mathayus is hired by a collection of the few remaining unconquered clans in the land to kill the sorceress and open the way for Memnon's defeat.The movie is a lot of fun.  From the action packed start to the all-stakes battle at the finish, it is almost non-stop action with a few breaks for exposition thrown in.  One of my favorite scenes involved Mathayus leading a band of Memnon's men into a cave during a sandstorm and then picking them off using traps set up in the cave.  It was well done, and allowed the audience to believe that the Rock was playing a character that was more than just another Conan.The Rock does an admirable job as the action hero and assassin.  I suppose all his years in the wrestling ring prepared him for the action sequences, but his acting at least is different from that of his personna as the Rock.  Try as he might, his down home American accent managed to peak through every once in a while.This movie is in a way a prequel to 'The Mummy Returns' in which Mathayus appears as the 'Scorpion King.'  In that movie, the Rock's character appears briefly at the beginning to set up the events that Brendan Frasier and company will explore thousands of years later, and then his character shows up again later in the climatic action scene.  This movie does not explain how Mathayus fell, so to speak.  In addition, 'The Scorpion King' doesn't rely on mystical aspects as much as 'The Mummy' and its sequel did, even though there is a sorceress present.As mentioned earlier, the DVD has plenty of extras.  The producers of the DVD tried to include a little bit of everything.  The best feature is the ability to enable alternate scenes.  The scenes in themselves don't change the outcome of the story; however, they add a prophecy that had been edited out of the final cut.  The prophecy speaks of a new king being crowned when the full moon is in Scorpio, and ties the whole movie together.  In fact, if they had left the prophecy in the movie, it would have made more sense and elevated the movie to something more than just an action flick.In addition to the alternate scenes, the extras include 'making of' mini-documentaries on special effects and the use of animals.  There are bios on the cast and crew.  There is a director's commentary and other 'making of' featurettes.  Godsmack's ""I Stand Alone"", which gets played during the credits, appears as a bonus video.  There is even a documentary on the real 'Scorpion King.'

The producers have spent a decent amount of dollars creating a world of long ago. They hired a lot of actors for big battle scenes, and are fairly generous with the computer special effects. And Da Rock does carry himself fairly well in his first starring role.But I think that even the producers would agree that that's about as ambitious as they needed to go. The folks that brought you the recent ""Mummy"" movies also brought you this one, and it looks like they'd like to keep a franchise going. While those movies weren't perfect, they did have a very worthy villain in the Mummy.This one is basically your standard plot of go and rescue the beautiful virgin, which is very reminiscent of Arnold's old ""Conan"" movies. The battle scenes are ok here, but when the camera settles on Da Rock, we just see him going through his wrestling motions. The computer effects were better in the other films, even with the unconvincing beetles in those movies being replaces by only slightly better fire ants.Just one more criticism of what is an ok film to see once. In this story we have the virgin with magical powers who loses them when she shacks up with the hero. Another plot borrowed from probably several movies, but ""Live and Let Die"" comes to mind. What is irritating though is how carefully choreographed her clothing and hair is done to fall on all the right places which give tantalizing peeks at her, but keeps the movie from getting an ""R"" rating.

592706,A1655SGPPUUCRP,B00005JKYX,Emily Todd,"[39, 43]","I went into ""The Scorpion King"" with pretty low expectations.  Being a lover of the first two ""Mummy"" films, I was terribly disappointed, like many, to learn that the next film in the series would be a prequel and not involve the usual charming cast of Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz.  I also went in expecting The Rock to be boring, cheesy, and annoying.  It seemed to me that ""The Scorpion King"" would serve one purpose, to show off The Rock's fighting ability (like we don't know already).Boy was I wrong!  ""The Scorpion King"" turned out to be a top quality action flick!  It was funny and filled with plenty of the witty humor that made ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"" such enjoyable films.  The story was actually quite exciting and involving, quite the opposite of what I expected!Believe it or not, The Rock was oddly charming in his role as Mathayus, The Scorpion King.  I actually ended up really loving him!  Mathayus's jittery sidekick, Arpid (Grant Heslov) steals the show!  Heslov is so charming and utterly hilarious, it's almost as if he was made for this role!  My only complaint as far as acting goes is that of Kelly Hu, who plays the sorceress (and Mathayus's love interest).  Her lines were cheesy to begin with, but an actress of greater talent could've delivered them with more enthusiasm and character.The movie begins rather unimpressively with Mathayus rescuing his brother from some barbaric enemies.  The fight sequence was fantastic, but what really turned me off about this scene (and made me question how good the rest of the film would be) was when Mathayus came barreling in to save his brother with his bow in hand and said ""Boo"" and everyone started screaming.  Come on; how cheesy and clich&eacute;d is that line?  Thank God the rest of the movie isn't like that!Here's a quick summarization of the plot:Mathayus is hired by a band of rebels to murder the wizard who is helping the evil Memnon win battles by seeing into the future for him.  Mathayus is set on completing his mission until he sees the wizard, who is actually the beautiful witch Cassandra.  Because of Mathayus's hesitation, Memnon's guards capture him and are about to kill him when Cassandra announces that she has had a vision and he is not to die by ""Memnon's hand or any that he orders"".  Yeah, right.  The movie takes off from there.Yes, this movie is dumb and ridiculous, but it somehow manages to rise above that to bring us a truly enjoyable film.""The Scorpion King"" is short but sweet, running at a convenient 90 minutes.Rated PG-13 for ""intense sequences of action violence and some sensuality"".

592708,AYMPVLWFKTAYE,B00005JKYX,"Erin K. Darling ""naive cynic""","[2, 2]","While ""The Scorpion King"" isn't as suspenseful or as exciting as its two predecessors, it is an entertaining story. The key is to go into it in a character-oriented frame of mind, rather than a Big Scary Monster mindset. There are no supernatural forces to speak of, save for some sorcery which produces prophecy, not undead critters. The action is based entirely on fight sequences, most of which are well-choreographed, incorporating elements of martial arts, classic sword fighting, and out-and-out brawling. It's a very pretty movie, with lavish sets, great costumes, and good acting talent. Most of the time, it doesn't take itself too seriously, due in large part to The Rock's outstanding performance.The storyline takes place millenia before ""The Mummy,"" in a time even before the pharoahs of Egypt. Civilization is largely tribal, with a few large cities here and there. In the city of Gomorrah (yes, the one of particular biblical fame,) a power-hungry man, Memnon, has taken control of legions of troops with the assistance of his sorceror, who can fortell the outcomes of battles. His intentions are perhaps good, but many suffer under his rule. Three men (Mathyus, his brother, and a man of unspecified origin) are the last of a tribe called the Acadians. They set out to end Memnon's reign by killing the sorceror, thereby robbing him of his unfair advantage. With the sorceror dead, other tribes will wage war upon Memnon, and with luck, defeat him.Naturally, there are snags along the way. Mathyus' brother and companion are killed in the initial raid on the camp where the sorceror lives, and Mathyus is left to kill the sorceror on his own. He reaches the chambers, and...is rather surprised by what he finds there. As things turn out, he doesn't kill the sorceror, and instead decides to go after Memnon himself. There are no edge-of-one's seat suspense or mysterious, supernatural foes here - it's a story of people struggling for their lives. The rest of the story is better left untold here; even though it's not a terribly original tale, it's still fun to watch it unfold. Most of us seem to enjoy even familiar tales told in new ways, and I surely don't want to steal anyone's good time!A large part of this film's charm is The Rock, who is a natural action hero; he brings fair acting talent, good fighting skills, a great sense of humor, and a highly-expressive face to his role as Mathyus, the future Scorpion King. He doesn't take himself or his acting too seriously, and this translates very well to this film.Also of interest is Steven Brand, who plays the bad guy, Memnon. He has excellent presence, very dark and quietly menacing, and carries off his fight scenes remarkably well considering he learned the skills only just before filming began. Kelly Hu is rather limited in her role, and I would have liked to have seen more of her special skills put to use throughout the movie.Michael Clarke Duncan does well as an initial adversary who becomes a partner with Mathyus. Sadly, his role is also fairly limited in how much he can express himself, but he does do some good fight sequences and looks appropriately intimidating.This edition of the DVD has some great extras, and in fact it might be a good idea to watch the ""making of"" special features first; they give a lot of inside information as to what was happening during the filming, what difficulties were encountered, and a general feel for the tone of the film. I think that, having watching the extras, I'll enjoy the film much more the next time around. There are some deleted scenes and a few out-takes, as well as commentary and alternate scenes that are enjoyable.It looks like everyone had a fun time making the movie, and that does show through in the final product. It's very pretty in all aspects (sets, people, costumes, soundtrack, colors, direction, special effects,) and I really enjoyed The Rock's acting in spite of myself. If you're looking for a nail-biter, this isn't it; however, if you're interested in who the Scorpion King was before he became, well, all evil and stuff, then you will probably like this. It does stand on its own, too, and I really do believe it will improve upon subsequent viewings.",3,"Not mindblowing, but good fun",1038614400,"11 30, 2002",2002,4215,"['Scorpion', 'King', ""n't"", 'as', 'suspenseful', 'as', 'exciting', 'two', 'predecessors', 'entertaining', 'story', 'key', 'go', 'character-oriented', 'frame', 'mind', 'rather', 'Big', 'Scary', 'Monster', 'mindset', 'are', 'supernatural', 'forces', 'speak', 'save', 'sorcery', 'prophecy', 'not', 'undead', 'critters', 'action', 'based', 'entirely', 'fight', 'sequences', 'most', 'are', 'well-choreographed', 'incorporating', 'elements', 'martial', 'arts', 'classic', 'sword', 'fighting', 'out-and-out', 'brawling', 'very', 'pretty', 'movie', 'lavish', 'sets', 'great', 'costumes', 'good', 'acting', 'talent', 'Most', 'time', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'Rock', 'outstanding', 'performance.The', 'storyline', 'place', 'millenia', 'Mummy', 'time', 'even', 'pharoahs', 'Egypt', 'Civilization', 'largely', 'tribal', 'few', 'large', 'cities', 'here', 'there', 'city', 'Gomorrah', 'yes', 'one', 'particular', 'biblical', 'fame', 'power-hungry', 'man', 'Memnon', 'taken', 'control', 'legions', 'troops', 'assistance', 'sorceror', 'who', 'can', 'fortell', 'outcomes', 'battles', 'intentions', 'are', 'perhaps', 'good', 'many', 'suffer', 'rule', 'Three', 'men', 'Mathyus', 'brother', 'man', 'unspecified', 'origin', 'are', 'last', 'tribe', 'called', 'Acadians', 'set', 'out', 'end', 'Memnon', 'reign', 'killing', 'sorceror', 'thereby', 'robbing', 'unfair', 'advantage', 'sorceror', 'dead', 'other', 'tribes', 'will', 'wage', 'war', 'Memnon', 'luck', 'defeat', 'him.Naturally', 'are', 'snags', 'way', 'Mathyus', 'brother', 'companion', 'are', 'killed', 'initial', 'raid', 'camp', 'where', 'sorceror', 'Mathyus', 'left', 'kill', 'sorceror', 'own', 'chambers', 'rather', 'surprised', 'what', 'there', 'things', 'turn', 'out', ""n't"", 'kill', 'sorceror', 'instead', 'decides', 'go', 'Memnon', 'are', 'edge-of-one', 'seat', 'suspense', 'mysterious', 'supernatural', 'foes', 'here', 'story', 'people', 'struggling', 'lives', 'rest', 'story', 'better', 'left', 'untold', 'here', 'even', 'not', 'terribly', 'original', 'tale', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'unfold', 'Most', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'even', 'familiar', 'tales', 'told', 'new', 'ways', 'surely', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'steal', 'anyone', 'good', 'time', 'large', 'part', 'film', 'charm', 'Rock', 'who', 'natural', 'action', 'hero', 'fair', 'acting', 'talent', 'good', 'fighting', 'skills', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'highly-expressive', 'face', 'role', 'Mathyus', 'future', 'Scorpion', 'King', ""n't"", 'take', 'acting', 'too', 'seriously', 'very', 'well', 'film.Also', 'interest', 'Steven', 'Brand', 'who', 'bad', 'guy', 'Memnon', 'excellent', 'presence', 'very', 'dark', 'quietly', 'menacing', 'off', 'fight', 'scenes', 'remarkably', 'well', 'considering', 'learned', 'skills', 'only', 'just', 'filming', 'began', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'rather', 'limited', 'role', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'special', 'skills', 'put', 'use', 'movie.Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'well', 'initial', 'adversary', 'who', 'partner', 'Mathyus', 'Sadly', 'role', 'also', 'fairly', 'limited', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'express', 'do', 'good', 'fight', 'sequences', 'appropriately', 'intimidating.This', 'edition', 'DVD', 'great', 'extras', 'fact', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'watch', 'making', 'special', 'features', 'first', 'give', 'lot', 'inside', 'information', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'filming', 'what', 'difficulties', 'were', 'encountered', 'general', 'feel', 'tone', 'film', 'think', 'having', 'watching', 'extras', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'next', 'time', 'around', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'few', 'out-takes', 'as', 'well', 'commentary', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'are', 'enjoyable.It', 'looks', 'everyone', 'had', 'fun', 'time', 'making', 'movie', 'show', 'final', 'product', 'very', 'pretty', 'aspects', 'sets', 'people', 'costumes', 'soundtrack', 'colors', 'direction', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Rock', 'acting', 'spite', ""'re"", 'looking', 'nail-biter', ""n't"", 'however', ""'re"", 'interested', 'who', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'was', 'became', 'well', 'evil', 'stuff', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'stand', 'own', 'too', 'really', 'do', 'believe', 'will', 'improve', 'subsequent', 'viewings']",The Scorpion King

I also find the story lines fun and the characters engaging.  These movies are great diversions.  So, I purchased the Scorpion King.  I knew that the original characters would not be in the movie, but the movie would have to be good because the first two were so much fun.  I find the Scorpion King to be very disappointing.  I still like the visual texture and the sound quality, but there is no story line of consequence.  I ask who the Scorpion King is because I took a look at the deleted scenes available on the DVD and I found that there IS a missing story line.  I cannot understand why the story was abandoned.  To find the hidden story line and why there is significance to when and where the showdown in this movie takes place, use the &quot;Alternate version in enhanced play mode,&quot; found on the DVD.  Then you MAY find an answer to, &quot;Who is the Scorpion King,&quot; for yourself.

592713,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B00005JKYX,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 1]","THE SCORPION KINGDwayne Johnson has come along way since his wrestling days as far as the movies are concerned. I personally have always liked ""The Rock"" especially when he was a heel in wrestling, so when I heard he was going to be in ""The Mummy Returns"" it seemed a natural fit. Maybe some day I will get into that movie but my over all feeling from him was he did a good job with his first role. As a pro wrestler it seems a natural fit for him to move over into movies, he certainly is better than Hogan by a long shot.This is a prequel to the aforementioned Mummy film and as an off shoot or sequel or whatever you want to call it this is pretty good. The story is about an ancient time, apparently before the time of the pyramids [even though the sequel to this which is also a prequel would contradict that], were a great warrior became a king. This king along side a fine sorcerer dominated all other kingdoms and became a tyrant destroying all who opposed him thanks to her visions. That is until the last of a people who are known to be the deadliest of assassins are hired by the remaining tribes to kill the sorcerer. So Mathayus [Dwayne Johnson/The Rock] and his two other fellow people are off to kill Cassandra the sorceress, they fail in their attempt and only Mathayus is left alive. Still he wakes up with his entire body buried except for his head and there are some hungry ants looking for some food. This is were he meets his new partner in crime the slippery thief Arpid, the two make for an amusing pair [every hero needs a comic relief side kick]. From here the two battle the king and his armies, go through massive sand storms, take the sorceress, and do battle with a tribe of all female warriors [sounds like a good time, especially that last part].While this movie certainly has flaws it is one of those turn off your brain for a while and just relax type flicks. The acting is solid and the action is good not to mention there is some very nice eye candy for all us fellas, ladies I suppose you have The Rock to look at. Director Chuck Russell does a good job here with the action in particular as that is the main reason this film was made, and writers Stephen Sommers, Jonathan Hales, William Osborne, and David Hayter did a decent job with the script. It feels flat at times as far as dialogue but even then I never expect much from these types of films in that department. As far as the final outcome this is a pretty good film but it just felt like it could have been epic. A story like this begs for an epic story with an epic outcome, this just seemed like a good story with a good outcome. I just feel like it could have been so much more.As far as the acting every one is solid and seemed like they had a great time making this, I know I would. Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock does a good job on this film but you can see that he gets better with each film but he does a good job on this. Steven Brand is really good as king Memnon as he seems to have had a lot of fun with this character. Same can be said for Michael Clarke Duncan who plays Balthazar the leader of a tribe full of female warriors [lucky him]. Kelly Hu is super fine in this film as Cassandra the sorceress and does a good job with her performance. Bernard Hill as Philos does a great job in this as well in this film, love them explosives. But it is Grant Heslov who I find to be the most amusing in this film as Arpid, don't know what it is but I am a sucker for comic relief.This movie is an enjoyable one but this is not the classic it could have been but at least it is better than most of the things out there. As far as The Rock's first starring film he did a good job and you could see back then that we was on his way to becoming a star. And for those wondering or if you do not know this is a WWE or at the time WWF film, Vince McMahon is an executive producer on this film. This is a fun movie that I would recommend to lovers of action flicks or people who like these back in the day films like Conan.",4,IT COULD HAVE BEEN EPIC,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,4016,"['SCORPION', 'KINGDwayne', 'Johnson', 'come', 'way', 'wrestling', 'days', 'as', 'far', 'movies', 'are', 'concerned', 'personally', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'Rock', 'especially', 'when', 'was', 'heel', 'wrestling', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'seemed', 'natural', 'fit', 'Maybe', 'day', 'will', 'get', 'movie', 'feeling', 'was', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'first', 'role', 'pro', 'wrestler', 'natural', 'fit', 'move', 'movies', 'certainly', 'better', 'Hogan', 'long', 'shot.This', 'prequel', 'aforementioned', 'Mummy', 'film', 'off', 'shoot', 'sequel', 'want', 'call', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'ancient', 'time', 'apparently', 'time', 'pyramids', '[', 'even', 'sequel', 'also', 'prequel', 'would', 'contradict', ']', 'were', 'great', 'warrior', 'became', 'king', 'king', 'side', 'fine', 'sorcerer', 'dominated', 'other', 'kingdoms', 'became', 'tyrant', 'destroying', 'who', 'opposed', 'thanks', 'visions', 'last', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'known', 'be', 'deadliest', 'assassins', 'are', 'hired', 'remaining', 'tribes', 'kill', 'sorcerer', 'So', 'Mathayus', '[', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson/The', 'Rock', ']', 'two', 'other', 'fellow', 'people', 'are', 'kill', 'Cassandra', 'sorceress', 'fail', 'attempt', 'only', 'Mathayus', 'left', 'alive', 'Still', 'up', 'entire', 'body', 'buried', 'head', 'are', 'hungry', 'ants', 'looking', 'food', 'were', 'new', 'partner', 'crime', 'slippery', 'thief', 'Arpid', 'two', 'make', 'amusing', 'pair', '[', 'hero', 'comic', 'relief', 'side', 'kick', ']', 'here', 'two', 'battle', 'king', 'armies', 'go', 'massive', 'sand', 'storms', 'take', 'sorceress', 'do', 'battle', 'tribe', 'female', 'warriors', '[', 'sounds', 'good', 'time', 'especially', 'last', 'part', ']', 'movie', 'certainly', 'flaws', 'one', 'turn', 'off', 'brain', 'while', 'just', 'relax', 'type', 'flicks', 'acting', 'solid', 'action', 'good', 'not', 'mention', 'very', 'nice', 'eye', 'candy', 'fellas', 'ladies', 'suppose', 'have', 'Rock', 'look', 'Director', 'Chuck', 'Russell', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'action', 'particular', 'main', 'reason', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'writers', 'Stephen', 'Sommers', 'Jonathan', 'Hales', 'William', 'Osborne', 'David', 'Hayter', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'script', 'flat', 'times', 'as', 'far', 'dialogue', 'even', 'then', 'never', 'expect', 'much', 'types', 'films', 'department', 'As', 'far', 'final', 'outcome', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'just', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'epic', 'A', 'story', 'begs', 'epic', 'story', 'epic', 'outcome', 'just', 'seemed', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'outcome', 'just', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more.As', 'far', 'acting', 'one', 'solid', 'seemed', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'making', 'know', 'would', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'Rock', 'good', 'job', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'better', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'Steven', 'Brand', 'really', 'good', 'king', 'Memnon', 'have', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'character', 'Same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'who', 'Balthazar', 'leader', 'tribe', 'full', 'female', 'warriors', '[', 'lucky', ']', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'super', 'fine', 'film', 'Cassandra', 'sorceress', 'good', 'job', 'performance', 'Bernard', 'Hill', 'Philos', 'great', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'love', 'explosives', 'Grant', 'Heslov', 'who', 'find', 'be', 'most', 'amusing', 'film', 'Arpid', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'am', 'sucker', 'comic', 'relief.This', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'not', 'classic', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'better', 'most', 'things', 'out', 'there', 'As', 'far', 'Rock', 'first', 'starring', 'film', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'could', 'see', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'way', 'becoming', 'star', 'wondering', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'WWE', 'time', 'WWF', 'film', 'Vince', 'McMahon', 'executive', 'producer', 'film', 'fun', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'lovers', 'action', 'flicks', 'people', 'who', 'back', 'day', 'films', 'Conan']",The Scorpion King

Then make the hero of said prequel the character doomed to a horrible fate inThe Mummy Returns, arguably a worse fate than that visited on the titular Mummy.  Then assemble a cast of unknowns, barely knowns, and character actors to act it out.  How could it POSSIBLY be anything but a disaster?...But it WASN'T a disaster!  In fact it was IMHO highly entertaining, almost as much fun as The Mummy itself!Why?Start with a leading man who exceeded all expectations.  You might expect a former athlete and professional wrestler with Dwayne Johnson's natural abilities to be a good potential action star, but unless you'd known him personally, you might NOT expect him to be such a good comedy actor, and it is no surprise to anyone who has seen this movie that the Rock has gone on to successfully star in so many comedies and children's movies.  The man clearly has as much (if not more) acting talent in that area as he does in more traditional action roles.  In addition by all accounts the Rock applied himself like a true professional and took the golden opportunity given him to learn as much about the movie making process as possible.Add a talented (and beautiful) leading lady.  It is an utter mystery to me why Kelly Hu has been so underused in movies and television, but she has certainly shone in those roles I've seen.  Some have criticized her performance here apparently not recognizing the limitations placed upon her by this role.  Despite being a black belt martial artist in real life, Kelly Hu is required to play the (almost but it turns out not completely) helpless damsel in distress in this movie, and I thought she did an excellent portrayal of a woman balancing on the knife edge, required to use cleverness and soft power to protect herself from brutish men, at least until the wild finale where she finally gets to kick some butt.(Funny story: I once won an autographed copy ofDead On, one of the creepiest thrillers I've ever read with one of the most intriguing premises I've ever heard of -- a serial killer chasing his prey through time, by suggesting Kelly Hu as the actress to portray the heroine Dr. Ann Yang, county medical examiner for Bucks County, PA, in the movie version.  The movie has never been made, but I still think Ms. Hu would be perfect for the role, and if you'd like to scare yourself silly, you could do worse than to readDead On, first published under a pseudonym.  But don't read it at night when you are alone in the house; seriously, DON'T!  You'll thank me.)The rest of the largely unknown then but soon to be much better known cast also measures up.  Steven Brand makes a fearsome, calculating villain who has convinced himself that he is the good guy; Michael Clarke Duncan, probably the best known of the cast prior to this movie, gives a great performance as the Rock's greatest potential rival/friend; Bernard Hill does a great absent minded scientist; Grant Heslov steals every scene he's in; and Tutu Sweeney did such a great job as the head street urchin that his role was expanded.The movie probably works best if you forget about the Scorpion King's eventual dark fate; the only hint here is the shadow of sadness we see on Kelly Hu's face as she says, ""Nothing lasts forever, my king,"" at the end, suggesting she has already foreseen it.  Interestingly by all accounts this was the last arguably great movie in the franchise.The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperorwas widely panned,The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warriorwas only good,The Scorpion King 3: Battle for Redemptionis awful, and the TV series was cancelled:The Mummy: The Animated Series - Volume 1,The Mummy: The Animated Series - Volume 2, andThe Mummy: The Animated Series - Volume 3.Note: If you like this movie, but you've only seen it in the theater or on TV, you owe yourself at least a viewing of the ""alternate"" version available only on DVD.  In addition to an entirely different opening scene that would have given the Rock one of the more spectacular entrances in movie history, and an extra line from Cassandra (Kelly Hu) that reveals her decision to help Mathayus (the Rock) to be more of a calculated risk than the theatrical version implies, the rest of the alternate scenes revolve around a prophecy that was cut out of the movie very late in production.  Essentially, Memnon (Stephen Brand) assumes that this prophecy about the rise of a Scorpion King is actually about him, but of course it really turns out to be about Mathayus.  The prophecy put more of a time constraint on events and explains why the movie takes place over just a matter of days.  It also explains why some of the now shortened or rewritten scenes were shot the way they were, which clears up a few minor mysteries.",5,This Movie Never Should Have Worked!,1326672000,"01 16,

592719,A1Y1YRO74S6ELA,B00005JKYX,"GreatWriterChrisJames ""ChrisJames""","[1, 2]","The Rock, Dwayne Johnson, former WWF Champion, and thePeople's Champion makes his first leading role acting debut as the Scorpion King.The Scorpion King is the prequel to the Mummy Returns in which the Scorpion King is killed and later tried to be revived.The success of the Mummy Returns and the Mummy lay in it's great story, action, effects and characters. The addition of the Scorpion King character in the MummyReturns was a big hit with movie fans. The Rock's brief role in that movie made a lasting impact on fans and the fans wanted more.Chuck Russell , the director of this movie, obviously took the success, that the character of The Scorpion King had in ''The Mummy Returns'' and added more depth and detail.The Rock underwent sword training, staff training, cardiovascular training for the Scorpion King.  Being over 5 time WWF Champ , the Rock already hadthe work ethic , dedication and charisma for the role. Although this is not mentioned. part of ''The Scorpion King's'' success lay on the fact, that the story is also similiar to the ''Conan The Barbarian'' movie with Arnold Schwarzenger.In fact, comparing the 2 movies, one can see that the Rock in a much shorter time, has become a greater actor than Arnold Schwarzenger.In his first films Arnold's movie and acting were less than stellar, so the Rock has managed to not only leave an impact with movie critics but entertained them as well. The Scorpion King is about an evil king, Memnon (Steven Brand), an evil king who has slaughters dozens of people including the village of Mathayus (The Rock).Mathayus is a desert assasin and a great warrior. Pretty soon , the people who fear Memnon agree that Mathayus must get rid of him. However, Memnon's sorcererss, Cassandra (Kelly Hu) plans to kill anyone trying to take over the land.Mathayus , the greatest warrior in the world, does not plan to let this happen, must kill Memnon before it's too late, and claim his right as the Scorpion King.In his quest, Mathayus is joined by Balthazar (Michael Clark Duncan) and many others who will fight side by side to get Memnon. This is where the real actions begins, as we are treated to a bunch of violent, but cool action scenes involvingswords , spears and more. The visual effects are also extremely well done,if you have seen the effects for ''The Mummy'', or ''The Mummy Returns'' then you won't be satisfied by the effects of this film.Interesting notes about the Scorpion King:The Discovery Channel recently had a special about uncovering a real life Scorpion King in Egypt, so the movie itself is not entirely made up. The success of the Scorpion King has spawned a couple of great games including a Gameboy Advance version and a planned Playstation version.Overall, the Rock does a successful and great acting role in his first lead, since ''The Mummy Returns''. ''The Scorpion King'' has plenty of action, visual effects and romance, to please even the most diehard fan. If you are already a fan of ''The Rock'' you are going to be very satisfied with this flick.Even if you are not a fan of ''The Rock'' I am sure you still love this great prequel to ''The Mummy Returns''.",5,The Rock as the Scorpion King,1088640000,"07 1, 2004",2004,3147,"['Rock', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'former', 'WWF', 'Champion', 'thePeople', 'Champion', 'first', 'leading', 'role', 'acting', 'debut', 'Scorpion', 'King.The', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'prequel', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'killed', 'later', 'tried', 'be', 'revived.The', 'success', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'Mummy', 'lay', 'great', 'story', 'action', 'effects', 'characters', 'addition', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'character', 'MummyReturns', 'was', 'big', 'hit', 'movie', 'fans', 'Rock', 'brief', 'role', 'movie', 'made', 'lasting', 'impact', 'fans', 'fans', 'wanted', 'more.Chuck', 'Russell', 'director', 'movie', 'obviously', 'took', 'success', 'character', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'had', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'added', 'more', 'depth', 'detail.The', 'Rock', 'underwent', 'sword', 'training', 'staff', 'training', 'cardiovascular', 'training', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'Being', '5', 'time', 'WWF', 'Champ', 'Rock', 'already', 'work', 'ethic', 'dedication', 'charisma', 'role', 'not', 'mentioned', 'part', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'success', 'lay', 'fact', 'story', 'also', 'similiar', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'movie', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenger.In', 'fact', 'comparing', '2', 'movies', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'Rock', 'much', 'shorter', 'time', 'become', 'greater', 'actor', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenger.In', 'first', 'films', 'Arnold', 'movie', 'acting', 'were', 'less', 'stellar', 'Rock', 'managed', 'not', 'only', 'leave', 'impact', 'movie', 'critics', 'entertained', 'as', 'well', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'evil', 'king', 'Memnon', 'Steven', 'Brand', 'evil', 'king', 'who', 'slaughters', 'dozens', 'people', 'including', 'village', 'Mathayus', 'Rock', '.Mathayus', 'desert', 'assasin', 'great', 'warrior', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'people', 'who', 'fear', 'Memnon', 'agree', 'Mathayus', 'must', 'get', 'rid', 'However', 'Memnon', 'sorcererss', 'Cassandra', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'kill', 'anyone', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'land.Mathayus', 'greatest', 'warrior', 'world', 'not', 'plan', 'let', 'happen', 'must', 'kill', 'Memnon', 'too', 'late', 'claim', 'right', 'Scorpion', 'King.In', 'quest', 'Mathayus', 'joined', 'Balthazar', 'Michael', 'Clark', 'Duncan', 'many', 'others', 'who', 'will', 'fight', 'side', 'side', 'get', 'Memnon', 'where', 'real', 'actions', 'are', 'treated', 'bunch', 'violent', 'cool', 'action', 'scenes', 'involvingswords', 'spears', 'more', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'also', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'have', 'seen', 'effects', 'Mummy', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'satisfied', 'effects', 'film.Interesting', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'recently', 'had', 'special', 'uncovering', 'real', 'life', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'Egypt', 'movie', 'not', 'entirely', 'made', 'up', 'success', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'spawned', 'couple', 'great', 'games', 'including', 'Gameboy', 'Advance', 'version', 'planned', 'Playstation', 'version.Overall', 'Rock', 'successful', 'great', 'acting', 'role', 'first', 'lead', 'Mummy', 'Returns', ""''The"", 'Scorpion', 'King', 'plenty', 'action', 'visual', 'effects', 'romance', 'please', 'even', 'most', 'diehard', 'fan', 'are', 'already', 'fan', 'Rock', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'satisfied', 'flick.Even', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'Rock', 'am', 'sure', 'still', 'love', 'great', 'prequel', 'Mummy', 'Returns']",The Scorpion King

The Mummy Returns portrays the Scorpion King as some evil tyrant who wants to take over the world by smiting any and all civilizations in his way. But that's exactly the opposite of the same character in his very own movie. In fact he struggles to overthrow an evil ruler for those very reasons.So when, and why, did he become bad? I'm afraid I'm not following this. The movie, however, is entertaining, if rather short and silly. Chuck Russell tries to cram in loads of fighting and hokum as he can. It works and The Rock is very cool as said King (or Mathayus) and former Jason victim Kelly Hu is gorgeous as the scantily-clad Cassandra. Grant Heslov and Michael Clarke Duncan fill out their usual roles as ethnic comic-relief and big, muscle guy.The film has slightly less integrity to it than the Mummy movies. This is evident with the fun and lively, but completely inappropriate, score by John Debney. I'm not expecting anything like his Passion of the Christ score but blaring death metal guitars seem kinda out of place in a movie set 3000 years BC.But this movie is a cheeseburger, not a 17-course dinner. So why bother complaining. After all it's a prequel of a sequel of a movie that was a re-make of a movie that was made in the 30's.

I mean who wouldn't be? 'The Mummy' and 'The Mummy Returns' that have been dubbed `silly' by many were I feel two fabulous films. A wonderful mixture of action, comedy, romance and overall fun. 'The Scorpion King' follows this same formula, but misses the mark ever so slightly and thus loses marks in my books.The film takes place before any of the pyramids have been built, back in the ancient land where warlord Memnon has conquered all the lands of the Old Kingdom, and where few people stand to fight his forces. When the scorpion king and his brother are sent to assassinate Memnon's sorcerer (who provides much of his power) they are caught and the scorpion king's brother is killed. This needless to say makes him very mad, and yearning for revenge. The story from here takes a turn when the scorpion king kidnaps the sorceress and consequently they fall in love.The biggest plus the film offers is the amazing fight scenes, which are some of the best seen in a long time. In fact for a movie that has a run time of 110 minutes, probably 40 minutes of this is just the fighting. Wrestling fans may perhaps be disappointed that 'The Rock' doesn't do one 'Rock Bottom' or a 'People's elbow' is the course of the film, but in my mind this may have made the film feel a little hokey, relying on the wrestling angle too much.So where does the problem fit in? Well 'The Scorpion King' isn't directed by Stephen Sommers (director of 'The Mummy' and 'The Mummy returns') and believes me it shows. The screenplay has all the wit and sparkle the other films had, but often the directing lets it down, at times making the story line fit into the action, rather than the other way around. Occasionally the film suffers for this.'The Rock' Dwayne Johnson puts in a commanding performance as 'The Scorpion King' and in my mind his style can be likened to Arnold Schwartzenegger, hey, lets not forget just as 'The Rock' is using wrestling as his foot in the door Arnie did the same with his bodybuilding. His characterization is commanding and his knowledge of choreographed action is visible, as the fight scenes are some of the best around. It also need to be seen the Michael Clarke Duncan ('The Green Mile') playing Balthazar is hilarious, I mean the guy is 'The Rock's' biggest fan in real life and here they are fighting together.Arguably the most popular character in the other two films was Jonathan (John Hannah) in 'The Scorpion King' the character is rehashed in the form of an all but nameless horse thief. Admittedly the character is hilarious, but on occasion his quips fall a little flat, plus part of Jonathan's charm in the other films is his flawed British attitude towards life.While 'The Scorpion King' lacks some of the charm 'The Mummy' and 'The Mummy returns' possessed the film is nevertheless competent. The fight scenes are amazing and it easily holds up to any other action film out there. Even more so the film may serve Vince McMahon (executive producer) a way to gain some of his lost funds after the failure of XFL. This film is one that has to be watched in order to see the first major work of one of the futures greatest action stars in Dwayne Johnson.

592729,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B00005JKYX,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[4, 4]","The Scorpion King is a fun action adventure breakthrough for the Rock. It's about a brave warrior (The Rock) who has been giving jewls by a desperate leader of a small army to kill a beautiful sorceress (Kelly Hu). They believe they'ed have a better chance against a ruthless warlord  (Steven Brand) with her dead, as he uses her gift to see the future to forsee the battles he's gonna have. As it's easier getting his men into war knowing they're gonna have  victory. The Rock captures the sorceress but of course falls in love with her so he decides to just kill the warlord instead as he owes him for killing his brother anyway. He befriends a  Nubian leader ( (Michael Clarke Duncan) to join in the battle.The result is a action packed adventure film that has minor flaws but is still well made. Some of the action original but it steals some from other movies too. For instance there's a action sequence that was stolen from Indiana Jones and the temple of doom where the hero is running behind a giant golden drum that's rolling alongside him as protection from some bad guys firing at him. Another problem and the biggest for me is the fact that there's no sign of the Scorpion King becoming evil, he doesn't act vicious, he's mostly cocky. Doesn't seem like the type of guy to make a deal with an evil god either like he does in the Mummy Returns which this film takes place before. The Scorpion King in that seems more like an alta-universe version of the Scorion King from the one here. Well anyway if  you ignore that this is still a good movie with the Rock showing signs of being a big action star.

In fact, the mix of accents (from homie Michael Clarke Duncan's Nubian king, Brand's prissy British and The Rock's clear and unaccented American diction) is a bit jarring, but...never mind.

Even the women get fun stuff to do, not only the toothsome Kelly Hu as the Sorcerer/Sorceress (hey guys, I can definitely tell you, it's SorcerESS) and the Nubian lasses are very athletic.

I'd like to tell you the plot, but I don't think there was one. The acting was straight from the John Wayne School of Drama; I need only say that the camel was one of the better actors. Most of them didn't bother with attempting accents from whatever part of the world this was supposed to be. The comic relief guy's vaguely Middle Eastern accent therefore made him seem like someone from another film who'd wandered in by mistake. The animals were also somewhat confused, since the camel, a North African dromedary, was joined by an Indian elephant and a couple of Bengal tigers, presumably a job lot from a menagerie offering better rates if all 4 were rented.The movie consisted of The Rock fighting various adversaries with different weapons, at a rate of a fight every 5 minutes or so. The weapons were from various parts of the world and various times in history, which compensated for the lack of variety in the story. In the end, the good guy, that would be the mercenary assassin, triumphed, having killed several hundred armed warriors single-handed.Why as many as two stars? First, it's a short movie. Other more pretentious films could learn from its lack of filler. It's a movie about The Rock fighting, so that's what it shows. After 90 minutes he runs out of people to fight and it ends. Second, it doesn't try to be something it's not. This isn't art, or a metaphor for life. It's just a guy who made his name taking part in fake, choreographed fights on TV taking his act to the big screen.I'm not trying to put anyone off this film.

I thought he was terrific in the cameo that he had in The Mummy Returns; way better than the CGI scorpion at the end of the film. His Saturday Night Live episode is one of my favorites. This foray into entertainment, though, should have been left in its entirety on the cutting room floor. The story is completely predictable and trite. There is nothing lovable about the character; there are no higher values explored than an undying need for revenge and there is no subplot of any real interest.

They represented a style of horror / comedy / action / thriller that is very much to my taste (and the taste of lots of other movie-ticket buyers...). I was rather pleased to hear that they were making a spin-off movie going into more detail about the Scorpion King, because there aren't enough good films in this genre. Well, there still aren't...this is not a good film.The Scorpion King was an interesting character in The Mummy Returns, but he only got a few minutes of screen time, and I don't recall him saying anything - his primary asset (the occasional muscle, or two) was on display, and all he really needed to do was to strike a few poses, a skill he brought with him from his day job as a pro wrestler. Now he is expected to carry the movie.I was a bit concerned. After all, he's a pro wrestler. Could he be expected to perform on a movie stage, where all the fights are carefully scripted and choreographed? Would he understand that this was fake fighting, so very different from what he was used to? (Still, they did give him furniture to fight with, even if it wasn't a metal folding chair). Could he act hurt when struck by a stuntman? Could he act pain? (Can I string this sarcasm out any further?)Actually, the biggest flaws in this movie don't relate to The Rock. He does everything he's supposed to, and delivers his lines rather well - better than Arnold Schwarzenegger did in his first few movies, that's for sure. So what's the problem? Well, the script is dreadful, and the central bad guy is utterly unconvincing. If we compare this movie to Conan the Barbarian (Arnie's first big movie, and quite comparable to this one) we note that Arnie's enemy was Thulsa Doom, played with sinister gusto by James Earl Jones. The Rock is playing opposite Steven Brand as Memnon - they'd have done better to use Michael Clarke Duncan (who plays Balthazar, leader of the Nubians). Steven Brand is not a bad actor, but he is hardly a figure to strike terror into the heart at first sight - such an actor would work in this role if the script built him up enough, but it doesn't. And that's my biggest criticism - this script is clich&eacute;d and boring. That's not what I expected, given that Stephen Sommers shares the writing credits, and he was responsible for the Mummy movies.",2,Even The Rock couldn't save this piece of crap!,1103846400,"12 24, 2004",2004,2344,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'Mummy', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'represented', 'style', 'horror', '/', 'comedy', '/', 'action', '/', 'thriller', 'very', 'much', 'taste', 'taste', 'lots', 'other', 'movie-ticket', 'buyers', 'was', 'rather', 'pleased', 'hear', 'were', 'making', 'spin-off', 'movie', 'going', 'more', 'detail', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'good', 'films', 'genre', 'Well', 'still', 'are', ""n't"", 'not', 'good', 'film.The', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'was', 'interesting', 'character', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'only', 'got', 'few', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'saying', 'anything', 'primary', 'asset', 'occasional', 'muscle', 'two', 'was', 'display', 'really', 'needed', 'do', 'was', 'strike', 'few', 'poses', 'skill', 'brought', 'day', 'job', 'pro', 'wrestler', 'Now', 'expected', 'carry', 'movie.I', 'was', 'bit', 'concerned', 'pro', 'wrestler', 'Could', 'be', 'expected', 'perform', 'movie', 'stage', 'where', 'fights', 'are', 'carefully', 'scripted', 'choreographed', 'Would', 'understand', 'was', 'fake', 'fighting', 'so', 'very', 'different', 'what', 'was', 'used', 'Still', 'did', 'give', 'furniture', 'fight', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'metal', 'folding', 'chair', 'Could', 'act', 'hurt', 'when', 'struck', 'stuntman', 'Could', 'act', 'pain', 'Can', 'string', 'sarcasm', 'out', 'further', 'Actually', 'biggest', 'flaws', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'relate', 'Rock', 'everything', 'supposed', 'lines', 'rather', 'well', 'better', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'did', 'first', 'few', 'movies', 'sure', 'what', 'problem', 'Well', 'script', 'dreadful', 'central', 'bad', 'guy', 'utterly', 'unconvincing', 'compare', 'movie', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'Arnie', 'first', 'big', 'movie', 'quite', 'comparable', 'one', 'note', 'Arnie', 'enemy', 'was', 'Thulsa', 'Doom', 'played', 'sinister', 'gusto', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Rock', 'playing', 'opposite', 'Steven', 'Brand', 'Memnon', ""'d"", 'have', 'done', 'better', 'use', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'who', 'Balthazar', 'leader', 'Nubians', 'Steven', 'Brand', 'not', 'bad', 'actor', 'hardly', 'figure', 'strike', 'terror', 'heart', 'first', 'sight', 'such', 'actor', 'would', 'work', 'role', 'script', 'built', 'up', 'enough', ""n't"", 'biggest', 'criticism', 'script', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'boring', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'given', 'Stephen', 'Sommers', 'shares', 'writing', 'credits', 'was', 'responsible', 'Mummy', 'movies']",The Scorpion King

I know the Rock played a character called the Scorpion King in ""The Mummy Returns,"" which was supposed to set up this film.  But the character has gone from a silent, brooding warrior of great strength and skill to a wisecracking, snarling warrior of great strength and skill.  Did I miss something?  At least in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" they explained how the character went from being the villain to the hero.  No such explanation is offered here for what I thought was a similar transition.  Then again, maybe I am guilty of thinking, which is not a prerequisite skill for watching this film.Ironically, you might enjoy this film more if you have not seen ""The Mummy Returns,"" especially if you are a devotee of WWF wrestling, the arena in which the Rock originally perfected his eyebrow arching technique.  The story is set way before the pyramids were build, when the original Scorpion King, Memnon (Steven Brand) was the best swordsman on the planet and used the prophetic talents of a sorceress (Kelly Hu) to rule the known desert.  Going up against him are the Arkadians, a group of professional assassins, of which Mathayus (the Rock) is the best and the brightest.  He is aided by a giant Nubian (Michael Clarke Duncan) is what is certainly an homage to the legendary friendship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu (sorry, I was thinking again).  Anyhow, ""The Scorpion King"" is clearly a standard action adventure in which the hero has to kill the bad guy, win the woman, and rule happily ever after.It dawns on me that this film is similar to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""  That film made Hong Kong wire work a part of the Hollywood cinematic repertoire, where as this film does the same for WWF Wrestling techniques.  This film is not happy unless it is going over the top.  When our hero shoots somebody with an arrow in this film the result is comparable to having used a small tactical missile: they are sent flying through the wall.  The film certainly delivers exactly what you would expect, high energy heroics at breakneck speed, but a bit more creativity would have been nice.  At least the dialogue knows it is supposed to be either tongue in cheek or painfully bad, so you cannot hold that against the film.  The Rock delivers the performance demanded by his fans, so that is not going to be grounds for big complaints either.  I did enjoy the film, more than I thought I would, but the ultimate standard for an action film is your desire to watch it again and again, and on that critical score ""The Scorpion King"" falls short",3,Ever wonder what WWF Wrestling would be like with swords?,1048982400,"03 30, 2003",2003,2568,"['am', 'so', 'confused', 'know', 'Rock', 'played', 'character', 'called', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'was', 'supposed', 'set', 'up', 'film', 'character', 'gone', 'silent', 'brooding', 'warrior', 'great', 'strength', 'skill', 'wisecracking', 'snarling', 'warrior', 'great', 'strength', 'skill', 'Did', 'miss', 'something', 'least', 'Terminator', '2', 'Judgment', 'Day', 'explained', 'how', 'character', 'went', 'being', 'villain', 'hero', 'such', 'explanation', 'offered', 'here', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'similar', 'transition', 'Then', 'again', 'maybe', 'am', 'guilty', 'thinking', 'not', 'prerequisite', 'skill', 'watching', 'film.Ironically', 'might', 'enjoy', 'film', 'more', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'especially', 'are', 'devotee', 'WWF', 'wrestling', 'arena', 'Rock', 'originally', 'perfected', 'eyebrow', 'arching', 'technique', 'story', 'set', 'way', 'pyramids', 'were', 'build', 'when', 'original', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'Memnon', 'Steven', 'Brand', 'was', 'best', 'swordsman', 'planet', 'used', 'prophetic', 'talents', 'sorceress', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'rule', 'known', 'desert', 'Going', 'up', 'are', 'Arkadians', 'group', 'professional', 'assassins', 'Mathayus', 'Rock', 'best', 'brightest', 'aided', 'giant', 'Nubian', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'what', 'certainly', 'homage', 'legendary', 'friendship', 'Gilgamesh', 'Enkidu', 'sorry', 'was', 'thinking', 'again', 'Anyhow', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'clearly', 'standard', 'action', 'adventure', 'hero', 'kill', 'bad', 'guy', 'win', 'woman', 'rule', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.It', 'dawns', 'film', 'similar', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'film', 'made', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'wire', 'work', 'part', 'Hollywood', 'cinematic', 'repertoire', 'where', 'film', 'same', 'WWF', 'Wrestling', 'techniques', 'film', 'not', 'happy', 'going', 'top', 'When', 'hero', 'shoots', 'somebody', 'arrow', 'film', 'result', 'comparable', 'having', 'used', 'small', 'tactical', 'missile', 'are', 'sent', 'flying', 'wall', 'film', 'certainly', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'high', 'energy', 'heroics', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'bit', 'more', 'creativity', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'least', 'dialogue', 'supposed', 'be', 'either', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'painfully', 'bad', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'film', 'Rock', 'performance', 'demanded', 'fans', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'grounds', 'big', 'complaints', 'did', 'enjoy', 'film', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'ultimate', 'standard', 'action', 'film', 'desire', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'critical', 'score', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'short']",The Scorpion King

This action pack from Chuck Russell doesn't hold the Indiana-Jones style that made &#65533;The Mummy&#65533; a hit; instead it seems more like a pre-teen no-brainer that barely can qualify for a decent action movie. The action/comedy formula that was the best feature in &#65533;The Mummy&#65533; is not here. Although comparisons are not entirely fair in this case. This movie is a lot more action and  less fantasy. Basically, it tries to play a very old formula: swords, beasts, warriors, babes, and the always-present comedy sidekick. It&#65533;s true, The Rock may not be Lawrence Olivier, but his charisma is clearly seen in the character of Mathayus. He is very good, now the movie... well, it could&#65533;ve been A LOT better.The editorial review is absolutely right when it says that &#65533;The Scorpion King&#65533; steals from a lot of better movies. It seems to me that the intention was to do a megahit like &#65533;Conan the Barbarian&#65533;. But how can you do this when you HAVE to make it PG-13? It just can't be done. With no explicit sex or violence and not even a drop of blood in combat, it's not enough the fact alone that you are The Rock. This genre&#65533;s lovers are know for their insatiable bloodlust, and the movie falls terribly short in this aspect and just doesn't deliver anything else that compensates for it. In a world where &#65533;Conan&#65533; was considered an expensive champagne, &#65533;The Scorpion King&#65533; would be nothing but a light beer.",2,A light barbarian,1035849600,"10 29, 2002",2002,1618,"['spin-off', 'Mummy', 'series', '65533', 'Scorpion', 'King', '65533', 'very', 'different', 'movie', 'gave', 'life', 'action', 'pack', 'Chuck', 'Russell', ""n't"", 'hold', 'Indiana-Jones', 'style', 'made', '65533', 'Mummy', '65533', 'hit', 'instead', 'more', 'pre-teen', 'no-brainer', 'barely', 'can', 'qualify', 'decent', 'action', 'movie', 'action/comedy', 'formula', 'was', 'best', 'feature', '65533', 'Mummy', '65533', 'not', 'here', 'comparisons', 'are', 'not', 'entirely', 'fair', 'case', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'action', 'less', 'fantasy', 'Basically', 'play', 'very', 'old', 'formula', 'swords', 'beasts', 'warriors', 'babes', 'always-present', 'comedy', 'sidekick', '65533', 's', 'true', 'Rock', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'charisma', 'clearly', 'seen', 'character', 'Mathayus', 'very', 'good', 'now', 'movie', 'well', 'could', '65533', 've', 'been', 'A', 'LOT', 'editorial', 'review', 'absolutely', 'right', 'when', '65533', 'Scorpion', 'King', '65533', 'steals', 'lot', 'better', 'movies', 'intention', 'was', 'do', 'megahit', '65533', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', '65533', 'how', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'HAVE', 'make', 'PG-13', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'done', 'explicit', 'sex', 'violence', 'not', 'even', 'drop', 'blood', 'combat', 'not', 'enough', 'fact', 'alone', 'are', 'Rock', 'genre', '65533', 's', 'lovers', 'are', 'know', 'insatiable', 'bloodlust', 'movie', 'terribly', 'short', 'aspect', 'just', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'anything', 'else', 'world', 'where', '65533', 'Conan', '65533', 'was', 'considered', 'expensive', 'champagne', '65533', 'Scorpion', 'King', '65533', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'light', 'beer']",The Scorpion King

I've read some of the other reviews here, and some people have criticized the movie for being overly cliched and predictable. No doubt some people will say that the movie serves up its hunk of beefcake in all-too-predictable a fashion (don't you hate smart-assed reviewers who take themselves all too seriously?). But come on folks, this sort of action-packed thriller isn't meant to be analyzed or dissected in too much detail--it's meant to be fun, mindless entertainment--and in that regard, it succeeds very well. I was also pleasantly surprised to find The Rock (pro-wrestler Dwayne Johnson) has considerable on-screen presence, as he goes around offing bad guys right and left.Not that The Rock has to carry the whole movie on his own considerable shoulders. The bad-guy king (Steven Brand) who The Rock is sent to assasinate and his sorceress (Kelly Hu) are also good in their roles, as is The Rock's sidekick (unfortunately I don't know the actor's name) who provides some comic relief, much in the same way that R2D2 and C3PO did in the first Star Wars movie (actually Lucas got the idea for the comic pair from one of Kurosawa's movies).The swordplay and fight scenes are top-notch. And speaking of swordplay, big guy Michael Clarke Duncan also has an important role as the Nubian king, and his fight with the Rock is one of the climaxes of the movie, as he almost beats The Rock in a dramatic mano-a-mano sword battle. I'm not sure there were black Nubians, who were well-known in Roman times after the emperor Octavian conquered North Africa, living in Sumeria in 4000 BC, when the Akkadians lived in ancient Sumeria, but as I said, I don't really analyze movies like this too much. It gets in the way of the fun.I don't know what ancient Akkadian or Sumerian sets would look like, either, but these seemed pretty realistic to me and added to the movie's overall ambience. (I'm sure King Sargon of Akkad would have approved even if they weren't--after all, the Akkadians haven't gotten much play in about 4000 years). This sort of action movie plays very well on the Big Screen, and I'm sure I enjoyed seeing it more in a theater as opposed to seeing it on TV.All in all, a fun way to spend a Sat. or Sun. afternoon or evening.

This film had two purposes: to be the latest reincarnation of the spear and sandal spectacular that Steve Reeves popularized back in the 60s and to showcase the muscularity and bashing prowesss of Hollywood's newest action hero, the Rock (Dwayne Johnson).  Part of the fun of THE SCORPION KING is to count the number or times director Chuck Russell borrows (ahem) from previous action films.  Besides the aforementioned Steve Reeves epics, Russell uses scenes straight out of the Indiana Jones trilogy and THE MUMMY, which also had The Rock in a bit part.The plot is nonsense of course.  Ditto for costuming, architecture, and historical accuracy.  But no one goes to see action films of ancient empires to quibble over anachronisms.  The Rock is Mathayas, a hired assassin whose job it is to kill a sorcerer.  Unfortunately, for his mission, the sorcerer turns out to be a sexy, leggy sorceress (Kelly Hu), with whom Mathayas falls predictably in love.  Along the way, there are sword fights every two or three minutes.  The special effects are first rate, and despite the legions of soldiers killed, no one really seems to possess any traits that would cause one to mark his passing with true emotion.  In movies like this, the fun of watching the emergence of a new action star unfortunately is built on the oldest of Hollywood's gimmicks: the dispatching of hordes of extras in so a bloodless manner that the viewer soon overlooks the rather quaint notion that extras are people too.  If Hollywood ever learns to build up an action hero without resorting to gratuitous bloodless violence, then it will be the first time for that.",3,Introducing the Rock,1042934400,"01 19, 2003",2003,1776,"['Movies', 'SCORPION', 'KING', 'are', 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'really', 'expected', 'see', 'movire', 'was', 'plot', 'character', 'driven', 'film', 'had', 'two', 'purposes', 'be', 'latest', 'reincarnation', 'spear', 'sandal', 'spectacular', 'Steve', 'Reeves', 'popularized', 'back', '60s', 'showcase', 'muscularity', 'bashing', 'prowesss', 'Hollywood', 'newest', 'action', 'hero', 'Rock', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'Part', 'fun', 'THE', 'SCORPION', 'KING', 'count', 'number', 'times', 'director', 'Chuck', 'Russell', 'ahem', 'previous', 'action', 'films', 'aforementioned', 'Steve', 'Reeves', 'epics', 'Russell', 'scenes', 'straight', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'trilogy', 'THE', 'MUMMY', 'also', 'had', 'Rock', 'bit', 'part.The', 'plot', 'nonsense', 'course', 'Ditto', 'costuming', 'architecture', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'one', 'see', 'action', 'films', 'ancient', 'empires', 'quibble', 'over', 'anachronisms', 'Rock', 'Mathayas', 'hired', 'assassin', 'job', 'kill', 'sorcerer', 'Unfortunately', 'mission', 'sorcerer', 'out', 'be', 'sexy', 'leggy', 'sorceress', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'whom', 'Mathayas', 'predictably', 'love', 'way', 'are', 'sword', 'fights', 'two', 'three', 'minutes', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'legions', 'soldiers', 'killed', 'one', 'really', 'possess', 'traits', 'would', 'cause', 'one', 'mark', 'passing', 'true', 'emotion', 'movies', 'fun', 'watching', 'emergence', 'new', 'action', 'star', 'unfortunately', 'built', 'oldest', 'Hollywood', 'gimmicks', 'dispatching', 'hordes', 'extras', 'so', 'bloodless', 'manner', 'viewer', 'soon', 'rather', 'quaint', 'notion', 'extras', 'are', 'people', 'too', 'Hollywood', 'ever', 'build', 'up', 'action', 'hero', 'resorting', 'gratuitous', 'bloodless', 'violence', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'time']",The Scorpion King

Like all such movies, its purpose is not to inform but to entertain.The movie is a prequel of sorts to ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"". It tells the story of how Mathayus [Dwayne Johnson, better known as The Rock] became The Scorpion King, although it never bothers to explain how he turned into the infamous villain of the earlier movies. [Perhaps the inevitable sequel will explain.] When his people are wiped out by the evil king Memnon [Steven Brand], Mathayus joins forces with former enemies to overthrow the tyrant. He must use his wits and his amazing physical powers to do this. He is aided in this by The Sorceress [Duncan Kelly Hu], a beautiful woman with mystical powers who has been enslaved for years by Memnon.The movie works because it makes no pretense of being anything other than a comical action-adventurer. It virtually laughs at its own silliness and downright delights in its cheesy dialog and special effects. Greatly adding to its entertainment value is The Rock, who seems destined for a long career as an action hero.

592759,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00005JKYX,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[3, 3]","I can officially say, hands down, I loved The Mummy &amp; The Mummy Returns. Of course, they both had Brendan Fraser in them - always helps. You know what I hate? When films get released, and then they do a prequel. That's what annoys about me the Stars Wars or whatever movies. What is the point?!But OK, &quot;The Rock&quot;, otherwise known as Dwayne Johnson, only had a small, what could almost be called a cameo, in The Mummy Returns. He almost appears from nowhere in the movie, just for a couple of small scenes at the start, and a major scene at the end - but I suppose he's all done by CGI at the end. And to capitalise on his role, Stephen Sommers made a prequel, to explain (albeit not very well) how Mathayus the Scorpion King came to be in The Mummy Returns. And I'm still lost.In The Mummy Returns, Mathayus the Scorpion King looks practically evil, and he really does look different in this. Obviously, they had to give him extensions again, just to keep the continuity, and making me relive my days as a professional Barbie doll hairdresser - I was just itching to braid his hair! I think this was set about 10 years before The Mummy Returns too?What's different between The Mummy movies, and this, is the lack of obvious special effects. Whereas in The Mummy movies, you had people being sucked quite literally dry, or being eaten by beatles, which demanded lots of CGI, there's not very much in this. (If you were a cynical person, which I'm so-o definitely not, then you could say it was due to lack of budget, due to the fact that The Rock got his hands on $5.5million for doing this movie) It's back to basic sword/fist fighting for The Rock, and lots of flexing of muscles. He quite literally romances the clothes off Kelly Hu - which wasn't hard, considering she didn't wear that much during the movie - and does all these weird looks, which totally reminded me of Brendan Fraser/Keanu Reeves/a guy I know! Although I desperately wanted to braid his hair, I think it would have more suitable to have short hair - plus he looks cuter with short hair. Can you imagine having to film days of scenes in the desert with hair like that?! I'd be pulling the extensions out there and then!There's been rumours (or maybe it's truth by now, I'm not totally 'up' on movie/actor news - I need to get down on my hands and knees for that kinda info and beg) that Dwayne will be the next Dirty Harry. HUH?! Where did that come from? OK, so we all know Clint Eastwood is on the wrong side of 70 to be doing anymore Dirty Harry movies. (I've said that now, and thinking he's only 68 or something like that), but Dirty Harry is a character. Maybe if you were to say that he was going to be the next Arnie (with those muscles, hell yeah!), but you can't say someone's gonna be the next so-and-so character. A character is meant to be unique, and the actor who plays him will always be known for playing that character. I'm sorry, but if he does decide to do a Dirty Harry movie, a) Clint will have something to say about it, b) I can't see my mum liking it and c) people reviewing it will make endless comparisons.There's heaps of extras on this, as is on both Mummy DVDs. And they literally take years to get through. Most of them aren't that much worthwhile - unless you're interested in breath-by-breath breakdowns of scenes - so all I was interested was the outtakes! But if you're into those kinda extras (which I'm not, I'd be braindead by the end of them - wait a second, am I?) then you'll be in your element with the DVD.This is a good film.

592760,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B00005JKYX,Mel Odom,"[8, 9]","King Memnon-with the aid of his sorceress, Cassandra, who has the ability to foretell the future-steadily conquers the world of southern Egypt in 3000 BC.  Defeated and driven before him, the various tribes and smaller nations face imminent extinction or subjugation before the ferocious army Memnon controls.  Every day brings more bloodthirsty warriors to fight under Memnon's standard.  In a last-chance bid to stand against the cruel king, one of the tribal elders hires a trio of the last Akkadian mercenary warriors.  For the blood price offered, the Akkadians agree to steal into Memnon's city and assassinate the king's sorceress.  Getting into the city is dangerous work, but Mathayus and his companions manage-only to be betrayed.  Just as Memnon is about to put Mathayus to death, the sorceress interrupts.  She says that Mathayus can't be killed by the king's hand or one of his men.  Instead, Mathayus ends up staked out in the desert, up to his jaw in sand as dreaded fire ants are riled from their holes.  Knowing the fire ants will kill him and eat the flesh from his bones, Mathayus makes a deal with a horse thief to free him.  Once loose, Mathayus returns to Memnon's city ready to wreak unholy vengeance.  However, fate conspires against the Akkadian warrior, and before he can take down Memnon, he must find and raise an army of his own.Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is a legend among WWF fans, but he's also starred in THE MUMMY RETURNS, setting up the role he plays in THE SCORPION KING.  The Rock has also made guest appearances on STAR TREK: VOYAGER, THAT `70S SHOW, and THE NET.  Michael Clark Duncan got an award nomination for his stint as John Coffey in THE GREEN MILE, but got his start bodyguarding stars and musicians.  He's also been in PLANET OF THE APES and ARMAGEDDON, and has the role of the Kingpin in the upcoming DAREDEVIL movie.  Versed in the martial arts, Kelly Hu got her start as Melia in GROWING PAINS, then had roles in FRIDAY THE 13th PART VIII: JASON TAKES MANHATTAN, THE DOORS, then recurring roles on NASH BRIDGES and MARTIAL LAW, and has a role in the upcoming X-MEN 2.As an action-adventure flick goes, THE SCORPION KING sings with violence, amazing fight choreography, and splendor that would rival an Old Hollywood period piece.  The Rock comes across very believably as Mathayus, one of the last Akkadian mercenary warriors, and a solid romantic lead.  His swordplay gleams and flashes, and his hand-to-hand combat are top-notch from all the WWF battles he's had.  The opening montage of action to set the movie into play is a blistering riff of everything the viewer has in store.  Kelly Hu, barely dressed throughout the movie, is simply gorgeous and carries her role as Cassandra easily, layering her performances in so that she underscores the action and the emotion.  Grant Heslov-playing Arpid, a horse-thief-steals the show upon occasion much as did Kevin J. O'Connor in THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS.  The pacing of the movie remains frenetic throughout, driving the viewer from one incredible scene to another.  Filmed entirely on location in California and in sound stages at Universal Studios in Burbank, THE SCORPION KING is a feast for the eyes, holding settings that look like they were only recently uncovered from the desert.  The final battle between hero and villain is awesome, captivating with intensity, and fraught with some real peril (The Rock actually had his eyebrows singed when the flaming swords got too close to him, as revealed in the DVD features).Well done as the movie is, there were a couple of spots that needed better editing.  Viewers never find out how Arpid escaped from the sand when he was buried up to his neck, and during the climb up the side of the building in Chapter 16, the wire-walking was entirely too obvious because the Rock's body remained too far out.  It would have been nice to see Kelly Hu kick (literally) loose with the martial arts she made look so good in MARTIAL LAW.  Also missing from the story (although it was deliberately done, according to director Chuck Russell), is a supernatural overtone.  Magic actually played a very small part in the overall scheme of things.THE SCORPION KING is an absolute must for the action-adventure fan, as well as people who loved the first two MUMMY movies starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz.  Anyone looking for a solid popcorn movie, a no-brainer that has action, thrills, and a good-natured sense of itself, can slip this DVD into the player and enjoy.",4,Slashing Swords!,1030752000,"08 31, 2002",2002,4516,"['King', 'Memnon-with', 'aid', 'sorceress', 'Cassandra', 'who', 'ability', 'foretell', 'future-steadily', 'conquers', 'world', 'southern', 'Egypt', '3000', 'BC', 'Defeated', 'driven', 'various', 'tribes', 'smaller', 'nations', 'face', 'imminent', 'extinction', 'subjugation', 'ferocious', 'army', 'Memnon', 'controls', 'day', 'more', 'bloodthirsty', 'warriors', 'fight', 'Memnon', 'standard', 'last-chance', 'bid', 'stand', 'cruel', 'king', 'one', 'tribal', 'elders', 'trio', 'last', 'Akkadian', 'mercenary', 'warriors', 'blood', 'price', 'offered', 'Akkadians', 'agree', 'steal', 'Memnon', 'city', 'assassinate', 'king', 'sorceress', 'Getting', 'city', 'dangerous', 'work', 'Mathayus', 'companions', 'manage-only', 'be', 'betrayed', 'Just', 'Memnon', 'put', 'Mathayus', 'death', 'sorceress', 'interrupts', 'Mathayus', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'killed', 'king', 'hand', 'one', 'men', 'Instead', 'Mathayus', 'up', 'staked', 'out', 'desert', 'up', 'jaw', 'sand', 'dreaded', 'fire', 'ants', 'are', 'riled', 'holes', 'Knowing', 'fire', 'ants', 'will', 'kill', 'eat', 'flesh', 'bones', 'Mathayus', 'deal', 'horse', 'thief', 'free', 'Once', 'loose', 'Mathayus', 'Memnon', 'city', 'ready', 'wreak', 'unholy', 'vengeance', 'However', 'fate', 'conspires', 'Akkadian', 'warrior', 'can', 'take', 'down', 'Memnon', 'must', 'find', 'raise', 'army', 'own.Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'legend', 'WWF', 'fans', 'also', 'starred', 'THE', 'MUMMY', 'RETURNS', 'setting', 'up', 'role', 'THE', 'SCORPION', 'KING', 'Rock', 'also', 'made', 'guest', 'appearances', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'VOYAGER', 'THAT', '70S', 'SHOW', 'NET', 'Michael', 'Clark', 'Duncan', 'got', 'award', 'nomination', 'stint', 'John', 'Coffey', 'THE', 'GREEN', 'MILE', 'got', 'start', 'bodyguarding', 'stars', 'musicians', 'also', 'been', 'PLANET', 'THE', 'APES', 'ARMAGEDDON', 'role', 'Kingpin', 'upcoming', 'DAREDEVIL', 'movie', 'Versed', 'martial', 'arts', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'got', 'start', 'Melia', 'GROWING', 'PAINS', 'then', 'had', 'roles', 'FRIDAY', 'THE', '13th', 'PART', 'VIII', 'JASON', 'TAKES', 'MANHATTAN', 'THE', 'DOORS', 'then', 'recurring', 'roles', 'NASH', 'BRIDGES', 'MARTIAL', 'LAW', 'role', 'upcoming', 'X-MEN', '2.As', 'action-adventure', 'flick', 'SCORPION', 'KING', 'sings', 'violence', 'amazing', 'fight', 'choreography', 'splendor', 'would', 'rival', 'Old', 'Hollywood', 'period', 'piece', 'Rock', 'very', 'believably', 'Mathayus', 'one', 'last', 'Akkadian', 'mercenary', 'warriors', 'solid', 'romantic', 'lead', 'swordplay', 'gleams', 'flashes', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'are', 'top-notch', 'WWF', 'had', 'opening', 'montage', 'action', 'set', 'movie', 'play', 'blistering', 'riff', 'everything', 'viewer', 'store', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'barely', 'dressed', 'movie', 'simply', 'gorgeous', 'role', 'Cassandra', 'easily', 'layering', 'performances', 'so', 'action', 'emotion', 'Grant', 'Heslov-playing', 'Arpid', 'horse-thief-steals', 'show', 'occasion', 'much', 'did', 'Kevin', 'J.', ""O'Connor"", 'THE', 'MUMMY', 'THE', 'MUMMY', 'RETURNS', 'pacing', 'movie', 'frenetic', 'driving', 'viewer', 'one', 'incredible', 'scene', 'Filmed', 'entirely', 'location', 'California', 'sound', 'stages', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'Burbank', 'THE', 'SCORPION', 'KING', 'feast', 'eyes', 'holding', 'settings', 'look', 'were', 'only', 'recently', 'uncovered', 'desert', 'final', 'battle', 'hero', 'villain', 'awesome', 'captivating', 'intensity', 'fraught', 'real', 'peril', 'Rock', 'actually', 'had', 'eyebrows', 'singed', 'when', 'flaming', 'swords', 'got', 'too', 'close', 'revealed', 'DVD', 'features', '.Well', 'done', 'movie', 'were', 'couple', 'spots', 'needed', 'better', 'editing', 'Viewers', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'Arpid', 'escaped', 'sand', 'when', 'was', 'buried', 'up', 'neck', 'climb', 'up', 'side', 'building', 'Chapter', '16', 'wire-walking', 'was', 'entirely', 'too', 'obvious', 'Rock', 'body', 'remained', 'too', 'far', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'kick', 'literally', 'loose', 'martial', 'arts', 'made', 'look', 'so', 'good', 'MARTIAL', 'LAW', 'Also', 'missing', 'story', 'was', 'deliberately', 'done', 'according', 'director', 'Chuck', 'Russell', 'supernatural', 'overtone', 'Magic', 'actually', 'played', 'very', 'small', 'part', 'overall', 'scheme', 'things.THE', 'SCORPION', 'KING', 'absolute', 'must', 'action-adventure', 'fan', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'who', 'loved', 'first', 'two', 'MUMMY', 'movies', 'starring', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Anyone', 'looking', 'solid', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'no-brainer', 'action', 'thrills', 'good-natured', 'sense', 'can', 'slip', 'DVD', 'player', 'enjoy']",The Scorpion King
592761,A2LW5FCXSNY87R,B00005JKYX,M. Ernsberger,"[1, 3]","After reading many of the reviews already on Amazon about ""The Scorpion King,"" my conclusion is that this movie is basically a ""chick movie.""  I don't mean this as a derogatory term, but simply that the movie is the type to appeal to women more than men, as the reviews seems to show.  The Rock isn't going to be nominated for an Oscar for this movie, but then Arnold Schwarzenegger has never gotten an Oscar nomination either.  And remember he got his start with movies like ""Conan the Barbarian.""  ""The Scorpion King"" is much better than the Conan movies.  There is far more action, definitely more humor, both of which The Rock delivers very well.  I can foresee a long future for him in the movies if he chooses his roles well, the way Arnold does, especially since he doesn't have an accent like Arnold's that people had to get used to.  Some people have complained that the historical setting of ""The Scorpion King"" is inaccurate.  This movie never purported to be based on historical fact, especially since the Mummy movies that preceded it also had inaccuracies (Seti was not killed by Imhotep, not to mention the fact that as one of his murderers, his mistress would not have been mummified with her organs put in canopic jars, a process that cost a lot of money and took forty days or so to do; also, there was no real Scorpion King in Egyptian history, which certainly would have been noted if real Armies of Anubis had swarmed over the land, slaughtering everyone in their path).  This movie is fantasy, just as ""Lord of the Rings"" is, which itself is set in Middle Earth, a place which doesn't exist, and has humans in it as well.  If you can't handle fantasy, don't see ""The Scorpion King"".  If you like a hunky hero (or a tough hero with a sense of humor if you're a guy), a funny sidekick, a beautiful love interest, scantilly clad women (if you're a guy; cool-looking costumes if you're a woman), butt-kicking battles, and a nasty villain who gets what he deserves, then this movie is for you!",5,For The Ladies,1028678400,"08 7, 2002",2002,2010,"['reading', 'many', 'reviews', 'already', 'Amazon', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'basically', 'chick', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'derogatory', 'term', 'simply', 'movie', 'type', 'appeal', 'women', 'more', 'men', 'reviews', 'show', 'Rock', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'movie', 'then', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'never', 'gotten', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'either', 'remember', 'got', 'start', 'movies', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'much', 'better', 'Conan', 'movies', 'far', 'more', 'action', 'definitely', 'more', 'humor', 'Rock', 'delivers', 'very', 'well', 'can', 'foresee', 'long', 'future', 'movies', 'roles', 'well', 'way', 'Arnold', 'especially', ""n't"", 'have', 'accent', 'Arnold', 'people', 'had', 'get', 'used', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'historical', 'setting', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'inaccurate', 'movie', 'never', 'purported', 'be', 'based', 'historical', 'fact', 'especially', 'Mummy', 'movies', 'preceded', 'also', 'had', 'inaccuracies', 'Seti', 'was', 'not', 'killed', 'Imhotep', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'one', 'murderers', 'mistress', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'mummified', 'organs', 'put', 'canopic', 'jars', 'process', 'lot', 'money', 'took', 'forty', 'days', 'so', 'do', 'also', 'was', 'real', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'Egyptian', 'history', 'certainly', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'noted', 'real', 'Armies', 'Anubis', 'had', 'swarmed', 'land', 'slaughtering', 'everyone', 'path', 'movie', 'fantasy', 'just', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'set', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'place', ""n't"", 'exist', 'humans', 'as', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'fantasy', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'like', 'hunky', 'hero', 'tough', 'hero', 'sense', 'humor', ""'re"", 'guy', 'funny', 'sidekick', 'beautiful', 'love', 'interest', 'scantilly', 'clad', 'women', ""'re"", 'guy', 'cool-looking', 'costumes', ""'re"", 'woman', 'butt-kicking', 'battles', 'nasty', 'villain', 'who', 'what', 'then', 'movie']",The Scorpion King

592763,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JKYX,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[1, 2]","Here's a real brain teaser for you: The Scorpion King is the prequel to the sequel to the remake of The Mummy. Confused yet? Let's hope not but if so then let's break it down for you. The Scorpion King is the new star vehicle for former WWE star Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. The Rock played a small role in The Mummy Returns, which was a sequel to The Mummy. The Mummy was a remake of the original mummy movie series from the 1950's. Got it? With that cleared up, a new question of why they would make a spin-off to The Rock's character emerges. The Rock has become a very popular ""actor"" in recent years, coming a far way from his early years in the wrestling ring, and Universal Pictures believe a good mint could be made off that popularity. If Dwayne Johnson plays his cards correctly, he could be the next Bruce Willis, Sly Stallone, or even Arnold Schwarzenegger of action films.The story centers on a leader of a band of assassins, who is hired to kill an important royal figure but gets more in this job then anybody bargained for. Mathayus, the last of a fleeting group of assassins, is hired by the leaders of rebel tribes to kill a sorcerer they believe their enemy is using to help him conquer the lands of Egypt. He accepts the job and arrives in the city of Gomorrah but when he realizes that the sorcerer is a beautiful woman, plans change quickly. He chooses to kidnap her instead of an assassination thus forcing the evil tyrant to bring everything he's got into a final confrontation between the remaining rebel tribes and ruling forces. Stephen Sommer was the director of the previous Mummy films but choose not to direct this spin-off feature and the pacing of this film showcases that. Though critics hammered The Mummy films for being hookie and cheesy, they never said once that they were not consistent. This is a problem that The Scorpion King never seems to solve as moments of romance and hilarity seem forced compared to the non-stop action sequences that work so well.The relatively small cast for The Scorpion King can only be described at meeting some expectations but not exceeding them if they some members even get to that level. This is the first major leading role for Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and surely won't be his last, at least based on the action sequences. The role of Mathayus (aka The Scorpion King) seems specifically designed for the former wrestler as he fits extremely well into the character though there aren't many well designed sequences to showcase his true acting chops. But then again, do you really expect those kinds of sequences in action flicks? Kelly Hu, who plays Cassandra, seems, at times, too confined into the typical woman role in action films but does get involved in some of the fight sequences, which is a welcomed change in Hollywood today. The remainder of the cast worked well together but not great.Overall, The Scorpion King, with its flashes of skin and heavy metal music, will no doubt satisfy the hardcore action freaks but will leave others starving. Unlike the previous Mummy films, The Scorpion King suffers in the story department as the story seems too caught up with the action sequences to makes the rest of the film as consistent. The film will no doubt bring out fans of action flicks as well as fans of The Rock and they will get everything they are looking for. But women and those who care more about the story then the action may find it on the bland side of things.

592764,A1JMQ88IMH0XJL,B00005JKYX,Mike,"[3, 8]","""The Scorpion King"" (2002)I went into The Scorpion King thinking it was going to be stupid, and I came out thinking it was stupid. This movie is just plain stupid. It was all just a big, bad idea. Sure, it has its good points, like some cool action sequences, but a couple of good action sequences every 10 or so minutes do not a good movie make.Even in its action sequences The Scorpion King fails at times. There are some spectacular battles, such as the opening sequence in which The Rock saves his brother from peril and the one where The Rock kills all his attackers without them even seeing him. However, the final fight is just so repetitive and boring, if well done. It showcases the best special effects in the movie (don't worry, there are no yuck Scorpion King effects like the one at the end of The Mummy Returns) but it feels just so dull and lifeless because we've already seen this...before in millions of movies.As for the big question on everybody's mind - can The Rock act? We expected to see that question answered with The Mummy Returns, but he says one line and fights in that movie, but with this film he's almost always on screen. But, no, he can't act. His facial expressions are over-the-top or under-the-top and never just right. He cannot act in dramatic or romantic scenes. However, he has fun with his role, and I like to see that in actors. He gets to kick some mighty big [rear], and he obviously likes playing his character. I don't think he's a good actor, but he's having a good romp. And whether I like it or not, he is the future action movie hero, so I better just get used to it.The rest of the cast isn't much use either. Steven Brand is laughable as the ""villain"". Kelly Hu has neither presence nor ability as an actress. Grant Heslov is so irritating as the ""comic"" relief. Peter Facinelli cannot act to save his life. And I don't have any idea at all as to what very good actors like Michael Clarke Duncan and Bernard Hill are doing in this movie. Duncan deserves much better material than movies like See Spot Run and The Scorpion King and after he turned in that stellar, heart-wrenching performance in The Green Mile you'd think he would become one of the great black actors of his generation. Not looking good so far. Hill I haven't seen so much of but he was plausible as the Captain in Titanic. Duncan doesn't do very well here and he's dull as ever. Hill is only mildly amusing as the crazy inventor type guy.The main problem with this movie is it is annoying. It has all the ingredients for being an annoying movie. It has an annoying action sidekick, annoying child actors, annoying, repetitive action sequences and the most annoying thing about the action sequences is that they're completely unfair. Spoilers At the end there is a big blow-up and, like, every evil person dies but no, the goodies somehow all live and nobody who disobeys The Rock is left alive. End SpoilersSome of the characters in this movie are very confusing. Possible Spoilers Michael Clarke Duncan's character in particular is strange and you never know if he's ruling an empire or trying to rule it, or against Mathayus (The Rock) or for him. Mathayus (or more easily known as the Scorpion King) is continuously changing his mind about if he wants the girl or doesn't want the girl. Of course at the end he gets the girl. Duh. I was also confused - is he good or bad? Because in The Mummy Returns he's one of the villains and in this movie he's the ""Warrior, Legend and King!"" Strange. End SpoilersOverall, this was nothing against The Mummy or The Mummy Returns. I only recommend seeing it if you're a complete wrestling nut and want to see The Rock in action.MY GRADE: C-",2,Dumb like I expected.,1020470400,"05 4, 2002",2002,3700,"['Scorpion', 'King', '2002', 'went', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'stupid', 'came', 'out', 'thinking', 'was', 'stupid', 'movie', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'was', 'just', 'big', 'bad', 'idea', 'Sure', 'good', 'points', 'cool', 'action', 'sequences', 'couple', 'good', 'action', 'sequences', '10', 'so', 'minutes', 'do', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'make.Even', 'action', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'times', 'are', 'spectacular', 'battles', 'such', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Rock', 'brother', 'peril', 'one', 'where', 'Rock', 'attackers', 'even', 'seeing', 'However', 'final', 'fight', 'just', 'so', 'repetitive', 'boring', 'well', 'done', 'best', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'are', 'yuck', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'effects', 'one', 'end', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'just', 'so', 'dull', 'lifeless', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'millions', 'movies.As', 'big', 'question', 'everybody', 'mind', 'can', 'Rock', 'act', 'expected', 'see', 'question', 'answered', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'one', 'line', 'fights', 'movie', 'film', 'almost', 'always', 'screen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'over-the-top', 'under-the-top', 'never', 'just', 'right', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'dramatic', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'However', 'fun', 'role', 'like', 'see', 'actors', 'kick', 'mighty', 'big', '[', 'rear', ']', 'obviously', 'playing', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'good', 'actor', 'having', 'good', 'romp', 'like', 'not', 'future', 'action', 'movie', 'hero', 'better', 'just', 'get', 'used', 'it.The', 'rest', 'cast', ""n't"", 'much', 'use', 'Steven', 'Brand', 'laughable', 'villain', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'presence', 'ability', 'actress', 'Grant', 'Heslov', 'so', 'irritating', 'comic', 'relief', 'Peter', 'Facinelli', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'save', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'Bernard', 'Hill', 'are', 'doing', 'movie', 'Duncan', 'much', 'better', 'material', 'movies', 'See', 'Spot', 'Run', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'turned', 'stellar', 'heart-wrenching', 'performance', 'Green', 'Mile', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'become', 'one', 'great', 'black', 'actors', 'generation', 'Not', 'looking', 'good', 'so', 'far', 'Hill', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'plausible', 'Captain', 'Titanic', 'Duncan', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'well', 'here', 'dull', 'ever', 'Hill', 'only', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'crazy', 'inventor', 'type', 'guy.The', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'annoying', 'ingredients', 'being', 'annoying', 'movie', 'annoying', 'action', 'sidekick', 'annoying', 'child', 'actors', 'annoying', 'repetitive', 'action', 'sequences', 'most', 'annoying', 'thing', 'action', 'sequences', ""'re"", 'completely', 'unfair', 'Spoilers', 'end', 'big', 'blow-up', 'evil', 'person', 'dies', 'goodies', 'somehow', 'live', 'nobody', 'who', 'Rock', 'left', 'alive', 'End', 'SpoilersSome', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'confusing', 'Possible', 'Spoilers', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'character', 'particular', 'strange', 'never', 'know', 'ruling', 'empire', 'trying', 'rule', 'Mathayus', 'Rock', 'Mathayus', 'more', 'easily', 'known', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'continuously', 'changing', 'mind', 'girl', ""n't"", 'want', 'girl', 'course', 'end', 'girl', 'Duh', 'was', 'also', 'confused', 'good', 'bad', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'one', 'villains', 'movie', 'Warrior', 'Legend', 'King', 'Strange', 'End', 'SpoilersOverall', 'was', 'nothing', 'Mummy', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'only', 'recommend', 'seeing', ""'re"", 'complete', 'wrestling', 'nut', 'want', 'see', 'Rock', 'action.MY', 'GRADE', 'C-']",The Scorpion King

And, on that level, it's a huge success.I had a blast watching this movie. It had good action sequences and special effects. In particular, The Rock was actually fun and could end up being a great action-movie star. This is one of those films that you have to expect a heavy dose of unrealism and corny one-liners to enjoy. But, that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. It reminded me of some of Arnold's earlier stuff that is all done tounge-in-cheek and is simply meant to entertain.

The next action that should occur is obvious. The Rock will spit in the villain's face, Rock Bottom him to the ground, and finish him off with the People's Elbow. Now, as you may have guessed, this does not happen, but that's probably because the movie takes place 5000 years ago somewhere in Egypt, rather than on the set of WWF Raw. Still, it's a good thing this fact wasn't taken too seriously, or else The Scorpion King would have lost some of its best moments (fire-ants & well... you know).

I actually laughed, because I am not used to seeing ""THE ROCK"" being romantic or very dramatic.  It was a shocking experience, but put together well.  The Scorpion King(SK) had all that I was expeciting throughout the entire movie.  The opening surely grabbed your attention.  I couldn't get rid of the smirk on my face for a long time.  I was overwhelmed at the amount of action involved.The Rock did a Great Job with this character, because he played it differently from the character he plays on WWF.  I actually expected to find him stop in the middle of a fight, and say, ""Can You Smell What The Rock Is Cooking"", or atleast see him pull of some wrestling moves similar to his wrestling character.  In all actuality, that did not happen.  I am very relieved to find that out.  Dwayne Johnson (The Rock)has put himself on the market to show that he can do more than just wrestle, he can act.  He did such a great job with this movie, that he can be called this New Century's Action Hero.  He is a mixture of that Arnold(Terminator), Sylvester(Rambo), and a mixture of the Jackie(Mr. Nice Guy), and Jet(The One).  I can't wait to see what happens next!  I'm sure that this is not Dwayne's last movie experience, and I hope not.I am not looking at this as one of his wrestling fans, because I lost interest in it ever sense WWF moved to TNN, and WCW left for good.  So, I am not relating him as much to wrestling as he is by other critics.  There was another aspect to this movie that made it a great quality.  The Comedy!...  There was endless humor in this movie, and it only got funnier.  Throughout the whole movie, there was a constant flow of energy happening, that made you want to be sitting so far on the edge of your seat, that made you practically fall of every 10 seconds.All in all, this movie is a must see.  Watch It, PLEASE!...  I also am expecting the release of a few other movies.  Suggestions are as follows....  Star Wars Episode II....watch!  Reign Of FIRE...watch!!!  Jason X....maybe!?  Spiderman...maybe!? ...  Men In Black II...a must see!!!  Austin Powers 3...if you like the series....DEFINETLY!...  There are alot more....but they are either too new...or just not good at all.

At least everybody in the world has seen how short the Rock's performance was in last year's ""The Mummy Returns"". But that was then, and this is now! I saw ""The Scorpion King"" a couple of days ago and to me, THIS is more like the Rock to have a challenging performance such as this, especially when he portrays the title role! The director of this film is not Stephen Sommers, who directed the ""Mummy"" films, it is director Chuck Russell, who brought you Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""Eraser"" and Jim Carrey's ""The Mask"" a few years back. Russell has certainly did an outstanding job with this prequel to the ""Mummy"" films! Also, WWF chairman Vince McMahon executive produced this film in which he did a great job as well. ""The Scorpion King"" focuses on an assassin called Methayus (Rock), who is later called the ""Scorpion King"". Methayus and his brother (Branscombe Richmond) infiltrate the camp of a ruthless, powerful, and undefeated leader named Memnon (Steven Brand), who has held prisoner a beautiful sorceress (Kelly Hu, ""Martial Law""). Methayus' brother gets killed after being captured and swears revenge against Memnon for it. And the film goes on from there.

But unlike many of the others, TSK is almost flawlessly done.Perhaps it should be called a ""legendary"" film instead of ""fantasy"", for it really contains no ""magic"" (unless you consider ""prophecy"" to be ""magic"" -- even the sorceress is really just a psychic), but otherwise it has all the typical trappings: assassins, thieves, amazons, barbarians, a prophecy (or two), a throne to be won, etc. Films of this type seem to fail in at least one of the following areas, while TSK excelled:1) Casting was brilliant: The Rock was unexpectedly good, and every character not only matched his stereotype, but performed so well that one forgets it IS a stereotype.2) Special Effects were outstanding: neither corny nor outrageous.3) Humor was perfectly integrated: TSK takes itself seriously, but injects humor at just the right places to keep the film from becoming either too serious or too absurd.4} The Story was focused: Characters have good reasons for doing what they do, and do what they have good reasons to do. Incidentally, there was neither need nor excuse for divine or magical intervention; even the prophecies' fulfillment was logical and seamless.TSK manages to combine all of the usual stereotypes and come out with a ""typical"" fantasy that is anything but typical.

First thing to watching a movie is to know what you like. If you don't like movie's where there's a ton of fighting, and the basic formula for action movies is followed, you shouldn't watch. I'm sure you already know the plot, so I'll tell you what I think and be done.Overall, it was a good movie. People who like movies based on ancient cultures, people who like a lot of action, or, yes, people who just wanna see The Rock, will like this. The only glaring problem that I see is that the dialogue is a little cheesey. The dialogue wasn't as good as either one of the Mummy's, but still wasn't as bad as some would lead you to believe. This and Mummy 2 weren't as good as the first one, with both having one glaring problem, the aforementioned dialogue in this, and that rediculous hot air balloon thing in Mummy 2.The Rock actually turns in a pretty good performance, especially considering it's baically his first movie (Mummy Returns hardly counts as a starring role). People who are criticizing his performance must forget what some of Arnold's early movies were like (unbearably pathetic). The action is good, Duncan does what his character was meant too, and the movie isn't long and drawn out like it could've been.All in all, a good movie, but please, if you only like artsy, or truly dramatic movies, don't waste your time.

I bought it, settled in with the grand kids and watched until chapter 17 when the movie came to a grinding halt (it stuttered, it jerked, it pixelated, it finally froze) just as the action was beginning.  We tried everything from cleaning the disc to cleaning the tray. We could skip chapter 17 and watch the rest fine but there went the story.  Eventually we flipped it over and watched the final chapters on the regular DVD side.  Frustrating I must say when so-called cutting edge technology turns out to be 'get it out there in the market and let the consumer deal with the glitches' technology.  A search of the web garnered that this was indeed an ongoing problem with this particular DVD and others from Universal (do your own homework - this is a review of Scorpion King).  With a nod to Amazon for a no-problem return policy we should have a new copy by the time you read this.  If defective I will edit this review to indicate the fact that it was two in a row (re-edit should be up by December 20, 2007 at the latest).  If not I will let it stand and you make up your own mind.  Either way our big adventure movie night was ruined and became a session in stress.  Never a good way to relax and enjoy the grand kids.UPDATE:  The replacement sent by Amazon worked fine.  It even appears to be a better Hi-Def version of the movie.

592788,A23VTC6VKNFZVE,B00005JKYX,Robert D. Williams,"[0, 0]","Way back in 4000 BC, when Akkadians still lived in Sumeria, Mathayus (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) an assassin and tough guy is assigned the task of traveling to the evil lord Memnon's (Steven Brand) city and killing his sorceress (the beautiful Kelly Hu).  Thereby reducing his power and causing his defeat.  His brother is captured and killed during the attempt.  And Mathayus vows revenge.  To aid him, Mathayus has his white camel and oh yes, Arpid (Grant Heslov) his less than enthusiastic assistant.  Philos (Bernard Hill) is an alchemist who invents gun powder for Memnon (not something you want Memnon to have).Mathayus manages to grab the sorceress and escape with her.  But instead of killing her, he falls in love, then fights Memnon to keep her.  The great Nubian Balthazar (the late Michael Clarke Duncan) is an ally that Mathayus has at last befriended.  Together they attack Memnon's fortress city.What makes this movie good is the interaction between The Rock and Hu.  They are extremely likeable characters.  And they seem to fit together.  There is plenty of action and fighting which carry this rather brief film along.  Hill, Heslov and Clarke give good believable performances and the movie has humor in it, even in some of the fight scenes.  With these guys after him, Memnon's chances are like a snowball in hell.I especially like the final scene where Mathayus is standing victorious with the sorceress by his side, with the Sumerian pillars, fires burning and the moon in the background.  It reminded me of a Frank Franzetta painting.The movie was great.  Director Chuck Russell did an outstanding job.

He starts off as an Akkadian mercenary crossing the ancient lands looking for his brother who is slain before his blazing eyes by a Nordic barbarian horde whose name is Memnon...What has kept the vicious tyrant as the absolute conqueror of the land is the fact that he has a visionary sorceress by his side who knows when he should attack his enemies... Mathayus finds out that she's a sexy gorgeous woman who looks amazingly beautiful (Surely the audience is teased ceaselessly by her cleavage-revealing...). So Mathayus forgets his commission to kill her, and a kind of romance begins to flourish between the two as he tries to carry out his assignment...Kelly Hu plays Cassandra, the female sorcerer who had beauty, charisma, cleverness, and enigma... In the beginning of the film, we're not quite sure where she stands... But when she first sees Mathayus, she's interested in the well-mannered warrior who's strong, brave, loyal and sincere... She realizes that he might me the future king who can save her from her power-mad jailer...As the ruthless conqueror, Memnon (Steven Brand) has got all of the skills needed to attain global domination... He has also got the force and the will to accomplish it... The combination was pretty scary...Michael Clarke Duncan plays the fearsome Balthazar, the Nubian King, the strong ally of Mathayus...Chuck Russell's ""The Scorpion King"" is a visual feast, and an entertaining action film...

592791,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JKYX,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 6]","Any historian foolish - or masochistic - enough to venture in to see ""The Scorpion King"" had best beware: five minutes into the movie, he will be asking for his money back (the rest of us might be too, but for different reasons).  The film is supposed to be based on Mathayas, the first known ruler of ancient Egypt, which would place the story somewhere around the year 3500 B.C.  Yet, you know you're in for trouble when, in the very first scene, a character begins to recite a litany of civilizations his particular people have defeated in battle and no fewer than two of them - the Babylonians and the Mycenaeans - wouldn't even come into existence for another thousand years or more!  Add to this the fact that much of the film takes place in the Biblical city of Gomorrah, which if it ever existed at all would have done so a good millennium after the events depicted in the film, and the fact that the hero rides around on a camel even though camel domestication didn't occur until around 1000 B.C. - and you have the makings of a real camp classic, destined to be remembered and laughed at by generations of moviegoers to come.If this sounds like nitpicking, perhaps it is.  After all, Hollywood is notorious for its shocking disregard of historical accuracy even in works set far closer to our present time than this one is.  So in that sense the sin of historical anachronism is a comparatively minor and forgivable one.  What is not so easily forgivable is the fact that ""The Scorpion King"" fails even on the most rudimentary level of mindless action/adventure entertainment.  Even for a Saturday matinee piece of escapism aimed at 12-year old boys, ""The Scorpion King"" displays a monumental lack of originality and imagination.  Dwayne Johnson (aka The Rock) gets to flex his muscles (and little else) in his first starring role, that of Mathayas, a great Akkadian warrior. In his pursuit of a sorceress who is helping a tyrannical king subdue all the civilizations in the area, Mathayas is joined by the customary accomplices and hangers-on: a cowardly comic sidekick, a young boy helper (think Short Round), a beautiful, but feisty damsel-in-distress (who actually IS the sorceress), an aging, eccentric scientist - even a faithful camel (in place of the more customary horse or dog) who obeys Mathayas' every command and with whom Mathayas seems to have an almost preternatural understanding.  ""The Scorpion King"" borrows so shamelessly from so many other better movies that one doesn't even know where to begin in listing all the examples.  There is even a ""hail to Dorothy; the wicked witch is dead"" finale guaranteed to elicit giggles from the audience.With nothing new or original to say or show, ""The Scorpion King"" is pretty much forced to rely on its action scenes and special effects to hold the audience's interest.  Unfortunately, the stunts are surprisingly tame and the special effects often shockingly bad - as when an army of man-eating ants races towards Mathayas, buried neck-deep in the sand, or when a sandstorm overtakes two armies out in the desert.It is hard to believe that it took four writers (count `em, FOUR) to come up with this script (there aren't even any good one-liners) and certainly director Chuck Russell deserves some of the blame for the fact that the line readings on the part of many of the actors wouldn't pass muster in a junior high school play or pageant (Michael Clarke Duncan is particularly egregious in this regard.  Perhaps he was hired in order to make the Rock seem more like an actor in comparison).It's hard for me to imagine that ""The Scorpion King"" will emerge as the vanguard for yet another lucrative action movie franchise.  Yet, whoever went broke underestimating the taste of the vast movie going public?

I did not see this one in theaters, and indeed wouldn't have seen it at all if a friend of mine had not insisted.I was wrong to avoid it. The Rock certainly demonstrates more range of acting ability than Schwarzenegger did in HIS early career, a comparison both apt and inevitable as there's more than coincidental similarity between the Scorpion King and Conan the Barbarian. The main villain is also interesting -- strongly, in fact, reminiscent of Russell Crowe's Maximus gone bad, a smart and resourceful warrior who may not have the sheer physical strength of someone like the Rock but whose speed and skill far outmatch virtually any opponent.I don't know how much influence the Rock had over the production, but they avoided one of the major pitfalls of movies of this sort: making the star-vehicle hero TOO good. The &quot;Scorpion King&quot; is tough, yes, good at what he does, yes, but his victories are often hard-fought. They also avoid too much humor without becoming grim.

Besides it wasn't gorey. It was just mostly made up of fighting. I like battle scenes. But really good ones. The fighting in Scorpion King were good but not excellent ones. The Rock wasn't too bad in this. I do like the guy. I think he's good action hero type. But can he really act? I'm not talking about fighting scenes. I'm talking about just regular dialogue. Which you don't see much of from him through the whole thing. Action scenes he was real good. But I'd have to see him in a few more movies to judge on wether or not he can even act. The movie was predictable (like most reviewers were saying on here). What movie can't you watch that isn't? They all have the basic storyline it's how it's done is what makes the difference. I don't ever watch a movie thinking the ending is going to surprise me. But anyway. This movie is worth watching. It has enough action but the scenes are kind of mellow.

The original Scorpion King was not The Rock, but another guy who with fast reflexes is hard to kill.  He can catch arrows in his bare hands and can deflect weapons with his sword.  He's the best swordsman ever and he's also ruthless.Plots:  I did enjoy the themes of revenge and a thirst for power and how power corrupts.  Not so good was the martial arts fighting - I doubt there were martial arts fighing in pre-Biblical times!  The casual mentions of Biblical cities, such as Sodom & Gomorrah, was interesting as well.The fast action was great, with Dwayne Cooke's crazy arrow scenes (where an arrow can hit you and has enough momentum to punch you out of a bar!), the pause as the beautiful sorceress he has been hired to kill falls in love with him, and the bad old King who finally loses his kingdom.Bottom Line:  Making one's own destiny is a lot of work, and the Rock does so out the top!  Kelly Hu as the sorceress is well worth the price of admission.

Though he only wrote this one it seems the same derivative Hollywood stylings there. While admittedly this movie has tons of high flying action, The Scorpion King brings hardly anything else to the table. Add to that the various cheesy details thrown in for good measure and you have an utterly mediocre film.The plot is your standard revenge on your brother&#8217;s killer while saving everybody around you in the process kind of fare. While technically there is  no problem with this kind of plot the movie fails to do anything to make their version stand out. Apparently all those action scenes are at the expense of the story. Wait until you find out why they call this guy Scorpion King. Has to be the dumbest thing I ever heard and it&#8217;s put in almost as an afterthought. The blood of scorpions flows in your veins&#8230; BAH! The supporting characters are almost completely disposable and the main characters lack any real depth or development. What&#8217;s with the goofy inventor and comedy relief? Basically the storyline just sits there and is only a vehicle for the incessant action.And I do mean incessant action. While some of the action scenes are pretty cool and all you just can&#8217;t escape the action. EVERY single scene in this movie has action in it. There is no change in the movie&#8217;s pacing and there is no room any plot or character development because of it. To make matters that much worse the sound effects are over the top along with the rest of the special effects. I mean if I hear another squishing noise every time The Rock stabs someone I&#8217;m going to scream. There are some cheesy flashy effects on this movie like flaming swords, bad CG effects and explosions (especially when there shouldn&#8217;t be any explosions).

Smith ""ltcolkiranerys""","[1, 2]","I was a wrestling fan long before The Scorpion King ever came out, and I have to say that Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock, is a master showman in whatever medium he chooses.  As Mathayus, the Arkadian assassin, he is a force to be reckoned with, hacking his way through his enemies with nary a backward glance.  His one weak spot is the Sorceress (Kelly Hu) he was meant to kill, but when he realizes the depth of his feelings for her, he will do anything to protect her.  Dwayne Johnson manages to combine both these elements into one film without making the story into a total joke in the process.I would like to point out that this movie is not for everyone.  If you're one of those out there who are looking for a film that is gravid with meaning and emotion, then The Scorpion King isn't for you.

I had no idea who ""The Rock"" was (I'd read about him, but somehow did not connect him with this film) I did not know ""The Scorpion King"" was supposed to be a prequel of the Mummy movies, neither of which I had seen.  So me and my popcorn had a clear, unbiased mind.The setting is long, long ago.  Gommorah is still in business and gunpowder has yet to be invented.  Arkkadian Assassin Mathayus (the Rock) has been hired to kill a sorcerer whose predictions are far too dependable. Mathayus' brother is tortured to death, and he vows revenge. When he discovers the sorcerer is a gorgeous young lady in a harem costume, he ""liberates"" her.  His steed is a camel, the odds against him are never less than 50 to 1, and he lays them out like dominoes. After 90 minutes of mayhem, the good guys win the kingdom, the castle and the babe.Dwayne Johnson was a charmer in this potboiler.  He has almost too good a sense of humor (I thought he was going to crack up a few times over his ridiculous lines. Shades of Crosby and Hope in a ""Road"" picture!) His face is expressive, his movements agile, and he is definitely eye candy.  I wish him well in a movie career.  I think he would be a fine action hero.  I felt sorry for his sidekick, Philos (Bernard Hill).  The script was so bad that the feeble jokes he was forced to utter wouldn't get a giggle out of a pre-schooler.  With the exception of a few reprehensible villains and mighty Balthazar (Michael Clarke Duncan), the cast was uniformly beautiful right down to the starving children.The action is non-stop, so time passes quickly and all in all, I had a good time.

The Rock.  The result is, as expected, derivative and some even say there is nothing new you can find here.  Wait a minute, it's not exactly true.The story is just an OK thing, with so many loud echoes coming from many other previous films including ""The Mummy"" franchise, but it's no surprise, considering that it was partly written by Stephen Sommers, the director of the two ""Mummy""s.  Moreover, you get some sense like ""I have seen this before"": Kelly Hu's character reminds us of ""the Bond Girl"" Jane Seymore played in ""Live and Let Die,"" and the bond between The Rock and his brother as the last members of the clan naturally goes back to ""The Last of the Mohicans.""  But, who seeks for originality in this place when all you need is an exciting popcorn film, which entertains us all with its action-packed story?And ""The Scorpion King"" attains its goal as such.  You will have what the poster of the film promises: many scenes of swords clushing, The Rock riding a camel in a desert, and sexy Kelly Hu, real scene-stealer.  The director Chuck Russel, after the awful ""Bless the Child,"" came back with his sure handling  of actions he showed in ""Eraser"" and about The Rock himself, he did his homework well, showing not-so-bad acting, but we all know that he can act ... he has done it well on WWF broadcasting, you know.  And see how he shows a sense of humor (check out the harlem scene where he raises his eyebrow, as he always does), but, see, that's what his fans already know.If The Rock keeps on acting with this pace, keeping in mind his humorous side, probably he turns out successfully as an action film hero, and this movie is good enough to prove his promising prospect, though it has no originality, and nothing new except lovely Hu.

592822,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JKYX,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[2, 2]","""The Scorpion King"" was the first spin-off from Stephen Sommers' sequel ""The Mummy Returns"" acting as a prequel. This allowed Sommers to tell us a bit more about the fascinating character of the Scorpion King. Although this origin story tidied up different story strands left unanswered in the first film (and revised how the main character got his name slightly in a way which didn't contradict but complimented the original story but also gave us a character slightly different than what we ended up seeing in ""The Mummy Returns""), it manages to stand on its own quite well even without any of the original characters (how could they be in a prequel? Well, perhaps Im-Ho-Tep could have figured in somehow but this does take place BEFORE his time)included in from the first two films. Although it wasn't quite up to the quality of ""The Mummy"" or ""The Mummy Returns"" in terms of originality, it's a solid b-movie spin-off of the series and very entertaining in its own right.By the way, there is a direct-to-video sequel without The Rock. I haven't seen it but was initially a bit confused believing this to have been a direct-to-video release (it wasn't although I recall that now when I first wrote the review I had forgotten about its brief but profitable theatrical run)which acts as a prequel to THIS film according to all descriptions. It comes out on August 19th. Whether or not this was a direct-to-video or theatrical release isn't important what IS important is the quality of the movie. I've seen some direct-to-video sequels that have been good and bad so that doesn't impact the quality of the film itself (unless it's a Sci-Fi Channel original movie--those are mostly bad, cheap looking and is an example of everything that is WRONG with Sci-Fi Channel in contrast to ""Doctor Who""(which the BBC produces), ""Eureka"" and ""Battlestar: Galatica""For those who have seen the movie (and if you're reading this I'm going to assume you have. If not and you want a synposis of the plot that's provided at the end of this review), you probably want to know how this looks on Blu-ray. As with ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"", ""The Scorpion King"" receives a nice transfer marred only by the over use of Edge Enhancement and Digital Noise Reduction to reduce film grain.All of the extras from the DVD edition (both the original edition and the reissue) are ported over to this fine release and this does include the U-Control feature(something carried over from Universal's HD-DVD releases) that will allow you to customize the extras including watching picture-in-picture commentary and behind-the-scenes footage.Written and produced (but not directed)by Stephen Sommers, ""The Scorpion King"" is an entertaining sword and sand epic that is filled with humor and just enough camp to make the film work. Director Chuck Russell does a great job of setting up the action sequences particularly one that takes place in a cave during a sandstorm as Memnon's men hunt for Mathayus. Russell does a terrific job of setting up the action and creating a suspenseful sequence in what could easily have been a muddled scene.Russwell does a good job of introducing Sommers' humor and story elements that are unique to this film. The Rock does a solid job in the lead role although its not exactly a stretch for him as an actor (does it matter really? This is an action film with the emphasis on the word ACTION), he makes a believable lead for the film.A prequel rather than a sequel, this spin-off tells us about Mathayus (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson)who is among the last of a dying breed of mercenary fighters hired to kill a sorceress Cassandra(Kelly Wu) who can see the future. Memnon (Steven Brand)uses Cassandra to predict the outcome of his battles as he takes over kingdoms. The result is that those who would oppose often give in without a fight.When Memnon kills Mathayus brother and leaves him for dead, Mathayus makes it his mission to exact both revenge and complete his task.""The Scorpion King"" manages to become an enjoyable and fun prequel to Sommers' hit films. It's not ""Citizen Kane"" (or ""The Godfather"") but doesn't pretend to be either.  ""The Scorpion King"" may not be as inventive,original or suspsenseful as either of ""The Mummy"" films but it is strong enough so that it could easily have been released to theaters and done well. Although it does display Sommers' writing moving towards the camp tendancies that hamstrung ""Van Helsing"", Russell's smooth direction rescues the film from becoming an overbearing campe fest.",3,"Entertaining prequel spin off from ""The Mummy Returns"" not quite up to that film but still fun",1217030400,"07 26, 2008",2008,4533,"['Scorpion', 'King', 'was', 'first', 'spin-off', 'Stephen', 'Sommers', 'sequel', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'acting', 'prequel', 'allowed', 'Sommers', 'tell', 'bit', 'more', 'fascinating', 'character', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'origin', 'story', 'tidied', 'up', 'different', 'story', 'strands', 'left', 'unanswered', 'first', 'film', 'revised', 'how', 'main', 'character', 'got', 'name', 'slightly', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'contradict', 'complimented', 'original', 'story', 'also', 'gave', 'character', 'slightly', 'different', 'what', 'ended', 'up', 'seeing', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'stand', 'own', 'quite', 'well', 'even', 'original', 'characters', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'prequel', 'Well', 'perhaps', 'Im-Ho-Tep', 'could', 'have', 'figured', 'somehow', 'take', 'place', 'time', 'included', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'up', 'quality', 'Mummy', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'terms', 'originality', 'solid', 'b-movie', 'spin-off', 'series', 'very', 'entertaining', 'own', 'right.By', 'way', 'direct-to-video', 'sequel', 'Rock', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'was', 'initially', 'bit', 'confused', 'believing', 'have', 'been', 'direct-to-video', 'release', 'was', ""n't"", 'recall', 'now', 'when', 'first', 'wrote', 'review', 'had', 'forgotten', 'brief', 'profitable', 'theatrical', 'run', 'prequel', 'THIS', 'film', 'according', 'descriptions', 'out', 'August', '19th', 'not', 'was', 'direct-to-video', 'theatrical', 'release', ""n't"", 'important', 'what', 'IS', 'important', 'quality', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'direct-to-video', 'sequels', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'bad', 'so', ""n't"", 'impact', 'quality', 'film', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'original', 'movie', 'are', 'mostly', 'bad', 'cheap', 'looking', 'example', 'everything', 'WRONG', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'contrast', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'BBC', 'Eureka', 'Battlestar', 'Galatica', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', ""'re"", 'reading', ""'m"", 'going', 'assume', 'have', 'not', 'want', 'synposis', 'plot', 'provided', 'end', 'review', 'probably', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'Blu-ray', 'Mummy', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'nice', 'transfer', 'marred', 'only', 'over', 'use', 'Edge', 'Enhancement', 'Digital', 'Noise', 'Reduction', 'reduce', 'film', 'grain.All', 'extras', 'DVD', 'edition', 'original', 'edition', 'reissue', 'are', 'ported', 'fine', 'release', 'include', 'U-Control', 'feature', 'something', 'carried', 'Universal', 'HD-DVD', 'releases', 'will', 'allow', 'customize', 'extras', 'including', 'watching', 'picture-in-picture', 'commentary', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage.Written', 'produced', 'not', 'directed', 'Stephen', 'Sommers', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'entertaining', 'sword', 'sand', 'epic', 'filled', 'humor', 'just', 'enough', 'camp', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'Director', 'Chuck', 'Russell', 'great', 'job', 'setting', 'up', 'action', 'particularly', 'one', 'place', 'cave', 'sandstorm', 'Memnon', 'men', 'hunt', 'Mathayus', 'Russell', 'terrific', 'job', 'setting', 'up', 'action', 'creating', 'suspenseful', 'sequence', 'what', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'muddled', 'scene.Russwell', 'good', 'job', 'introducing', 'Sommers', 'humor', 'story', 'elements', 'are', 'unique', 'film', 'Rock', 'solid', 'job', 'lead', 'role', 'not', 'exactly', 'stretch', 'actor', 'matter', 'really', 'action', 'film', 'emphasis', 'word', 'ACTION', 'believable', 'lead', 'film.A', 'prequel', 'rather', 'sequel', 'spin-off', 'Mathayus', 'Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'who', 'last', 'dying', 'breed', 'mercenary', 'fighters', 'hired', 'kill', 'sorceress', 'Cassandra', 'Kelly', 'Wu', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'future', 'Memnon', 'Steven', 'Brand', 'Cassandra', 'predict', 'outcome', 'battles', 'kingdoms', 'result', 'who', 'would', 'oppose', 'often', 'give', 'fight.When', 'Memnon', 'Mathayus', 'brother', 'dead', 'Mathayus', 'mission', 'exact', 'revenge', 'complete', 'task', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'become', 'enjoyable', 'fun', 'prequel', 'Sommers', 'hit', 'films', 'not', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Godfather', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'either', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'inventive', 'original', 'suspsenseful', 'Mummy', 'films', 'strong', 'enough', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'theaters', 'done', 'well', 'display', 'Sommers', 'writing', 'moving', 'camp', 'tendancies', 'hamstrung', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'Russell', 'smooth', 'direction', 'film', 'becoming', 'overbearing', 'campe', 'fest']",The Scorpion King

The plot is so telegraphed that the whole sum of the film can be figured out in the first few minutes.  Kelly Hu's outfits boarder on the ridiculous.  Her clothes would be better suited for a Jenna Jameson movie, and are so out of place in several of the action scenes that they elicit a chuckle.  The film is like a James Bond movie with barbarians, in this respect.And yet...I enjoyed it!  Maybe I was in the right mood for it, or maybe the director balanced that fine line between camp and drama.  Dwayne Johnson made an incredibly intelligent choice to eliminate the personality and trademarks of ""The Rock"" (With the exception of a quick glimpse of ""The People's Eyebrow"") and develop a new character.  Honestly, I think the film is carried by his personal charisma.  I would be happy to see him in more films.  Michael Clarke Duncan is woefully under used.  He is a true actor, and should have been allowed to be more than a stereotypical buddy/brute.
