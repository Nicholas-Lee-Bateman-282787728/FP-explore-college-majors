72331,AD2BIAIH78QI5,0784001332,"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal""","[29, 29]","Pure and simple, there will never be another Olivier--he stands apart, the marvel of his profession. True, his last years were too full of movies just made for a buck, featuring dubious European accents, but when you see him as he was meant to be seen, in Shakespeare, you begin to understand his depths. Take his Shylock, here in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. I had read this play over and over for my Masters thesis, and thought I knew it pretty well. Then, when I saw this video, it was like hearing the dialogue for the very first time. He brings insight into the most inconsequential lines, and of course power to crucial scenes. So why not 5 stars, then? Well, this is one of those versions where the director felt like time traveling. For some reason, it's 1860, and Shylock is wearing a bowler hat. Why? You lose the point that a Renaissance stage jew would have been dressed  very differently than the Christian Venetians, a visible indicator of Shylock's alienation. And important scenes with his daughter Jessica have been cut out, in order to force a certain directorial concept. If it ain't broke.... Notwithstanding all this, Olivier's Shylock is really something to behold. I wouldn't trade it for a wilderness of monkeys.",4,His obit said it all--Olivier the Great,997315200,"08 9, 2001",2001,1243,"['Pure', 'simple', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'Olivier', 'apart', 'marvel', 'profession', 'True', 'last', 'years', 'were', 'too', 'full', 'movies', 'just', 'made', 'buck', 'featuring', 'dubious', 'European', 'accents', 'when', 'see', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'seen', 'Shakespeare', 'begin', 'understand', 'depths', 'Take', 'Shylock', 'here', 'quot', 'Merchant', 'Venice', 'quot', 'had', 'read', 'play', 'Masters', 'thesis', 'thought', 'knew', 'pretty', 'well', 'Then', 'when', 'saw', 'video', 'was', 'hearing', 'dialogue', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'insight', 'most', 'inconsequential', 'lines', 'course', 'power', 'crucial', 'scenes', 'So', 'why', 'not', '5', 'stars', 'then', 'Well', 'one', 'versions', 'where', 'director', 'felt', 'like', 'time', 'traveling', 'reason', '1860', 'Shylock', 'wearing', 'bowler', 'hat', 'Why', 'lose', 'point', 'Renaissance', 'stage', 'jew', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'dressed', 'very', 'differently', 'Christian', 'Venetians', 'visible', 'indicator', 'Shylock', 'alienation', 'important', 'scenes', 'daughter', 'Jessica', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'order', 'force', 'certain', 'directorial', 'concept', 'ai', ""n't"", 'broke', 'Notwithstanding', 'Olivier', 'Shylock', 'really', 'something', 'behold', 'would', ""n't"", 'trade', 'wilderness', 'monkeys']",N/A
72332,AAW58LG72PG7I,0784001332,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[1, 1]","How the audience is supposed to interpret Shakespeare's intent at presenting Shylock as either the stereotypical Jewish moneygrubber or an heroic and sinned against ethnic depends largely on the interplay of three factors: his original intent in writing THE MERCHANT OF VENICE; the then prevailing popular caricature of the Jew demon that Elizabethan audiences expected and demanded in their entertainment; and Shakespeare's propensity to delineate a complex character by combining a series of competing and occasionally puzzling motivations.  In the 1973 version, Laurence Olivier plays Shylock as one who stands out from everyone else not only by his wildly varying deeds but also by his equally varying manner of dress.That generations of audiences have chosen to see multiple layers of allegory is simply a testimony to Shakespeare's dramatic skill, but in this version, Olivier's stellar performance places an entrenched anti-Semitism front and center so that a time-warped Bard's contemporary audience would pay money to see their demon Jew thoroughly humbled.  Modern audiences are politically correctly conditioned not to appreciate Olivier's homage to a previous century's viewpoint.Though Shylock is flawed grievously in many ways, it is less obvious that everyone on stage seems flawed as well, and this flaw is a direct result of anti-Semitism practiced not only by Shylock. And it is here that Shakespeare decides to try what was daring then and still is now.  On the one hand, he gives the audience their gloating over the humbled Jew, and on the other, he holds up the play as a mirror against which they could look into their souls to measure the depths of or lack of their common humanity.  Despite the cutting of some key scenes, the audience can sense that the entrenched anti-Semitism of the 16th century was so prevalent that it disfigures and reduces the basic decency of both violator and victim.  Antonio, an otherwise decent sort, torments Shylock for no other reason than Jew-baiting.  Even Portia, (Joan Plowright), who is presented as the near apotheosis of just womanhood indicates her own incipient prejudice as she warns Shylock about not spilling any Christian blood.  And what of Shylock?  Shakespeare permits him to speak in his own defense, and Olivier comes through in more than one scene, but behind Shylock's inner pain the audience of Shakespeare's day had to be manipulated into overlooking that Shakespeare had to walk a fine line between portraying Shylock as one sinned against but still ensuring that by the close of the play he would emerge as one ground to dust.  Olivier manages to walk this delicate balance in a manner better suited to the 16th century than to the 20th.As Shylock leaves the stage for the last time, Olivier as Shylock leaves the audience with the seeming mixed message that prejudice erodes the humanity of all it touches.  This magnificently staged production manages to convince Olivier's audience just as well as Shakespeare's own.",5,How Much Anti-Semitism is Too Much?,1181433600,"06 10, 2007",2007,3001,"['How', 'audience', 'supposed', 'interpret', 'Shakespeare', 'intent', 'presenting', 'Shylock', 'stereotypical', 'Jewish', 'moneygrubber', 'heroic', 'sinned', 'ethnic', 'depends', 'largely', 'interplay', 'three', 'factors', 'original', 'intent', 'writing', 'THE', 'MERCHANT', 'OF', 'VENICE', 'then', 'prevailing', 'popular', 'caricature', 'Jew', 'demon', 'Elizabethan', 'audiences', 'expected', 'demanded', 'entertainment', 'Shakespeare', 'propensity', 'delineate', 'complex', 'character', 'combining', 'series', 'competing', 'occasionally', 'puzzling', 'motivations', '1973', 'version', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Shylock', 'one', 'who', 'out', 'everyone', 'else', 'not', 'only', 'wildly', 'varying', 'deeds', 'also', 'equally', 'varying', 'manner', 'dress.That', 'generations', 'audiences', 'have', 'chosen', 'see', 'multiple', 'layers', 'allegory', 'simply', 'testimony', 'Shakespeare', 'dramatic', 'skill', 'version', 'Olivier', 'stellar', 'performance', 'places', 'entrenched', 'anti-Semitism', 'front', 'center', 'so', 'time-warped', 'Bard', 'contemporary', 'audience', 'would', 'pay', 'money', 'see', 'demon', 'Jew', 'thoroughly', 'humbled', 'Modern', 'audiences', 'are', 'politically', 'correctly', 'conditioned', 'not', 'appreciate', 'Olivier', 'homage', 'previous', 'century', 'viewpoint.Though', 'Shylock', 'flawed', 'grievously', 'many', 'ways', 'less', 'obvious', 'everyone', 'stage', 'flawed', 'well', 'flaw', 'direct', 'result', 'anti-Semitism', 'practiced', 'not', 'only', 'Shylock', 'here', 'Shakespeare', 'try', 'what', 'was', 'daring', 'then', 'still', 'now', 'one', 'hand', 'audience', 'gloating', 'humbled', 'Jew', 'other', 'up', 'play', 'mirror', 'could', 'look', 'souls', 'measure', 'depths', 'lack', 'common', 'humanity', 'cutting', 'key', 'scenes', 'audience', 'can', 'sense', 'entrenched', 'anti-Semitism', '16th', 'century', 'was', 'so', 'prevalent', 'basic', 'decency', 'violator', 'victim', 'Antonio', 'otherwise', 'decent', 'sort', 'torments', 'Shylock', 'other', 'reason', 'Jew-baiting', 'Even', 'Portia', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'who', 'presented', 'near', 'apotheosis', 'just', 'womanhood', 'own', 'incipient', 'prejudice', 'Shylock', 'not', 'spilling', 'Christian', 'blood', 'what', 'Shylock', 'Shakespeare', 'speak', 'own', 'defense', 'Olivier', 'more', 'one', 'scene', 'Shylock', 'inner', 'pain', 'audience', 'Shakespeare', 'day', 'had', 'be', 'manipulated', 'overlooking', 'Shakespeare', 'had', 'walk', 'fine', 'line', 'portraying', 'Shylock', 'one', 'sinned', 'still', 'ensuring', 'close', 'play', 'would', 'emerge', 'one', 'ground', 'dust', 'Olivier', 'manages', 'walk', 'delicate', 'balance', 'manner', 'better', 'suited', '16th', 'century', '20th.As', 'Shylock', 'stage', 'last', 'time', 'Olivier', 'Shylock', 'audience', 'seeming', 'mixed', 'message', 'humanity', 'magnificently', 'staged', 'production', 'manages', 'convince', 'Olivier', 'audience', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'Shakespeare', 'own']",N/A

Technically it is a comedy because it ends with a wedding, but it explores issues of prejudice and anti-semitism,  and Shylock's fate (forced conversion and poverty) is hardly cheering.  Hal  Holbrooke once said that the measure of any Shylock is how he leaves the  stage after the climactic courtroom scene.  Olivier's exit is pained,  proud, and sad.  This is a stark play of a stubborn and despised man who is  destroyed not because of his obvious personal flaws, but because of the  prejudices and unfairness of his persecutors.  After all, Shylock abided by  the contract, Antonio weasled out and punished Shylock to boot.",5,Excellent Olivier,957052800,"04 30, 2000",2000,730,"['Merchant', 'Venice', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'Shakespeare', 'most', 'troublesome', 'controversial', 'plays', 'Technically', 'comedy', 'wedding', 'issues', 'prejudice', 'anti-semitism', 'Shylock', 'fate', 'forced', 'conversion', 'poverty', 'hardly', 'cheering', 'Hal', 'Holbrooke', 'once', 'said', 'measure', 'Shylock', 'how', 'stage', 'climactic', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'Olivier', 'exit', 'pained', 'proud', 'sad', 'stark', 'play', 'stubborn', 'despised', 'man', 'who', 'destroyed', 'not', 'obvious', 'personal', 'flaws', 'prejudices', 'unfairness', 'persecutors', 'Shylock', 'abided', 'contract', 'Antonio', 'weasled', 'out', 'punished', 'Shylock', 'boot']",N/A
72334,A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW,0784001332,The Peripatetic Reader,"[0, 0]","Adaptions of Shakespeare's plays are tricky propositions. They either work or don't work, and many times the reasons that are not obvious. One tweaking here, one twist there, any false move that does not add or explain the play will ruin the entire experience. Fortunately, that is not the case with this adaptation of Merchant of Venice.This production really works for reasons apart from Olivier's inspired interpretation of Shylock. In this production the setting appears to be in Nineteenth Century England, perhaps the late Victorian era. I say ""appear"" because there are some scenes which give the clues of the canals of Venice, while everything else in the play points to Victorian England.No matter. There are enough strong performances which make this a viewing experience. Anthony Nicholls gives a commanding performance as Antonio, and likewise Jeremy Brett as Bassario. Michael Jayston, who is good in any role, provides a different interpretation of Gratiano, but, in conjunction with the other characters in this adaption, works well. It is a fine ensemble performance which bears repeated viewings.Olivier is similarly outstanding in his portrayal of Shylock. He is the master of imitation and dons a convincing and empathetic Shylock. His is still the unparalleled interpreter of Shakespeare, although Branaugh does try.Viewers curious to view this version should look to the VHS version of this play; the DVD version is far costlier.
