Five men are without jobs. One is about to lose his child because of back custody payments. Another is afraid to tell his wife that he has been laid off until they come to repossess his furniture. One  has a marriage that is failing and he doesn't know how to fix it. Each has his own story, and together they come up with a scheme to make some money.At moments hillarious, at times touching, and in the end a demonstration of men willing to overcome odds to at least try something to make their situation better.With heavy British accents, I watched it the first couple of times with the subtitles turned on.

436206,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304813759,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","`The Full Monty' is one of those films that remains enjoyable no matter how far removed you are from the date of its release.  The themes presented, the witty dialog and the overwhelming emotional feeling you get from the film's resounding finale will leave you wanting more (or at least to watch the film again).The film tells the story of a bunch of unemployed steel workers in England trying to make sense of their unemployment and put together a way to provide for themselves and their families.  Each man contends with his own drawbacks, insecurities and personal dilemmas, but they all come together in a way that highlights the loyalties of friendships.  When it is decided that they are going to put on a Chippendale's inspired strip-show things take off in unexpected directions.  Their decision challenges everyone involved, but not just in the physicality of it all (they are out of shape and unfamiliar with `technique') but also in the emotional, for it pushes them and their loved ones in uncomfortable positions.The great thing about `The Full Monty' is that is beautifully meshes both the comedic and the dramatic to create a fully fleshed out portrayal of real human bonds, struggles and triumphs.  The cast is hugely responsible for this, and they excel in beautiful ways.  Robert Carlyle carries the film rather well, giving it a hefty push with his dry wit and unexpected charm.  It is the supporting cast though, namely Tom Wilkinson and Mark Addy, who really make this film so special.  Their depth of conveyance is seen in every scene they embody, especially Addy who just creates such a moving and haunting portrayal of a man desperate to feel worthy of what he has.This is a smart comedy that we weren't expecting, but one that we embrace and cherish.  It has become a recognizable piece of cinema today, but sadly many only really consider this as a `comedy about male strippers' and it really is so much more than that.  Those who haven't seen this may snicker at the film's title and jeer at its premise, but this film has so much more heart than one would expect.So very worth it!",5,The real deal!,1339718400,"06 15, 2012",2012,2109,"['Full', 'Monty', 'one', 'films', 'enjoyable', 'matter', 'how', 'far', 'removed', 'are', 'date', 'release', 'themes', 'presented', 'witty', 'dialog', 'overwhelming', 'emotional', 'feeling', 'get', 'film', 'resounding', 'finale', 'will', 'leave', 'wanting', 'more', 'least', 'watch', 'film', 'again', '.The', 'film', 'story', 'bunch', 'unemployed', 'steel', 'workers', 'England', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'unemployment', 'put', 'together', 'way', 'provide', 'families', 'man', 'own', 'drawbacks', 'insecurities', 'personal', 'dilemmas', 'come', 'together', 'way', 'loyalties', 'friendships', 'When', 'decided', 'are', 'going', 'put', 'Chippendale', 'inspired', 'strip-show', 'things', 'take', 'off', 'unexpected', 'directions', 'decision', 'everyone', 'involved', 'not', 'just', 'physicality', 'are', 'shape', 'unfamiliar', 'technique', 'also', 'emotional', 'loved', 'ones', 'uncomfortable', 'positions.The', 'great', 'thing', 'Full', 'Monty', 'beautifully', 'meshes', 'comedic', 'dramatic', 'create', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'portrayal', 'real', 'human', 'bonds', 'struggles', 'triumphs', 'cast', 'hugely', 'responsible', 'excel', 'beautiful', 'ways', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'film', 'rather', 'well', 'giving', 'hefty', 'push', 'dry', 'wit', 'unexpected', 'charm', 'supporting', 'cast', 'namely', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Mark', 'Addy', 'who', 'really', 'make', 'film', 'so', 'special', 'depth', 'conveyance', 'seen', 'scene', 'embody', 'especially', 'Addy', 'who', 'just', 'creates', 'such', 'moving', 'haunting', 'portrayal', 'man', 'desperate', 'feel', 'worthy', 'what', 'smart', 'comedy', 'were', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'one', 'embrace', 'cherish', 'become', 'recognizable', 'piece', 'cinema', 'today', 'sadly', 'many', 'only', 'really', 'consider', 'comedy', 'male', 'strippers', 'really', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'may', 'snicker', 'film', 'title', 'jeer', 'premise', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'heart', 'one', 'would', 'expect.So', 'very', 'worth']",Full Monty VHS

It is not a deep movie, it will not give you insight into British politics or humanity itself, just lots of good laughs.We watch as 6 unemployed Yorkshire bloks work up the courage and, dare I say, the talent, to go the Full Monty after the Chppendale Dancers swagger their goods through town. Seeing this as an easy way to fatten their wallets we go through the emotions of these every day guys trying to just make it in the world when they lose their jobs, their furniture and lives when the Steel Mill they work in closes.It is great to watchthe relationships in this movie.  That between Mark Addy's character and his wife that he thinks is cheating on him, because he sees himself as to fat.  Addy and Robert Carlyle as friends is fun and funny. The greatest relationship to watch is between Carlyle and the kid who plays his son Nate. All this stripping hulabaloo started as a way for Carlyle (Gaz) to repay his back child support so he can continue to see his son whom he loves very much, though he may not always be the best role model. The kid is in on some of the casting calls and helps with the music. All the characters are a shear riot to watch.I highly recommend this film.

436208,ARA48345JZPZR,6304813759,Archmaker,"[69, 71]","Just about the time you think no one is capable of making a fresh and original comedy anymore, along comes something like The Full Monty, to surprise and delight you with wit and subtlety and insight.The story of unemployed steel workers in Sheffield, England who decide to put on a male striptease show for one night to make some money is a simple premise that is beautifully realized because of the time the film takes to build our understanding of these men and their different plights and motivations.  We come to know and care for them as they come to care for each other. The comedy grows from the characters and their personalities and their different reactions and situations.  There is sympathy and sensitivity to their desperation: Gaz (Robert Carlyle), the ex-con hustler, desperate to keep a connection with his son; Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), the manager, desperate to hold onto his middle-class lifestyle; Dave (Mark Addy), chubby and insecure, desperate to hold onto his wife; and so on.  Expertly played by these actors, new to American audiences in 1997, but now familiar, the laughter evoked is wry and humane and, in the end, joyful.The film carefully builds the story with expert comedic setups (the auditions and rehearsals, etc.) of everyday men trying to do something they are seemingly unequipped and ill-prepared to accomplish, with touches of pathos as we see the troubles and strains in their personal lives.  All this leads to the Big Night and a grand finale that is funny, heart-warming and beautifully filmed.  A terrific little film with a lot on its mind, beneath the humor.  Something to do with the dignity of work, of self-respect, and of the touching care one can find amidst people undergoing hard times.

Centered around a group of men that decide stripping in a women's club (inspired by a visit of Chippendale dancers) is a way to make money, we are treated to a hilarious look at a bunch of regular joes with less-than-perfect bodies and with no dancing ability trying to become the men that women clamour for.

I originally thought that this one wouldn't be good just on the basis of it's plot but in the end, this movie delivers a lot of laughs and for the ladies, some great male stripping that's really funny.It starts out with 2 friends, Gazzer and Dave.  Both are recently laid off steel mill workers and are looking for work.  After they get turned away from their favorite bar because of an all ladies Chippendale performance, Gazzer gets a great idea, ""what if we were strippers?  We'd make a lot of money"".  Just one problem, there's only 2 of them and they can't dance.  After holding some open tryouts, they find some other guys they used to work with that want to do this as well, including their former foreman that's also unemployed.  While working on their routine, Gazzer realizes that they have to do something special, they have to do THE FULL MONTY (be completely naked).  Now it's a question of who's still in it.O.k. even though I'm a guy, I still laughed at this one because it's still pretty funny.  The guys are really funny, the music and soundtrack is great (a lot of great hits from the 70's) and just because the guys are the most unlikely strippers is pretty funny.  That and this movie took a lighthearted look on some very serious topics like suicide, divorce, homosexuality, unemployment and even the difficulty of being overweight.  You'd be surprised, but this movie might hit somewhere with some people.Ladies will definitely get a kick out of this one and even the guys can take a laugh out of this.  And for any of you guys plotting to do your own type of Chippendales thing, here's an instructional video for you = )  In any case, this is an enjoyable movie.  And who could forget the ""fun with Garden Gnomes"" scene?  That scene alone is hilarious.

The movie instantly became one of my favorites. I don't know how close to the realities of British life it is/was but ""Full Monty"" is irresistible, and it features the songs of Donna Summer and Tom Jones that fit adorably to the story. I saw it again few days ago and it has not lost any of its original charm.  It is funny but it is more in the realm of dramedy which is my favorite genre.Few things I've noticed this time:Nothing is more tiring than doing nothing. Men are really very sensitive and insecure creatures. They have to have respect for themselves and this is a great movie about how far the desperate men would go to regain it.I think every boy would dream about having a father like Carlyle's Gaz - he is more like a buddy, not a father.Did I mention that after seeing the movie first three times I bought a Donna Summer's CD?And...The finals scene is spectacular.

However, given that it was up against 'Titanic', you'll know how  unrealistic that hope was. 'The Full Monty' is billed as a comedy, but it  has a lot more to offer. The characterizations are particularly strong, and  the story that is told is actually pretty complex. It offers comments on  the collapse of old industries, and the quiet desperation of the workers  that are left behind. People living in America's rust belt or Canada's  Maritimes should be able to sympathize very strongly with these poor men  from northern England, struggling just to make a living.This is a story  about humiliation, and more than just the humiliation of taking off one's  clothes in public.

436245,AWA0CA9AYL5YQ,6304813759,Jennifer Litchfield,"[0, 0]","The Full Monty is a ""right good laff"" (to borrow the parlance of its protagonists). Although the dialect may occasionally bewilder viewers unused to north-England speech, the humour doesn't need any translation. Gaz is down on his luck and is possessed of an endless supply of far-fetched money-making schemes. Inspired with a visit by the renowned Chippendale male strip-show artists to his hometown of Sheffield, and impressed at the huge amounts of money they make by seemingly just taking off their clothes and prancing around a bit, Gaz decides this is his ticket to some fast cash.Part of the reason this film is likeable is that humour and realism go hand in hand. From the depressing backdrop of an industrial town with high unemployment, Gaz manages to cobble together a troupe of six unlikely strippers, including a suicidal security worker, a man with a dodgy hip, and a well-endowed bathroom repairman. These guys aren't super-studs, they're just ordinary blokes who are willing to give it a shot, and maybe, just maybe, get rich.The film begins with Gaz and his friend Dave becoming marooned on a partially submerged car in the middle of a canal (the unanticipated result of one Gaz's plans), and the originality of the comedy continues throughout. So fresh is the humour, that the occasional moments when it sinks to the level of slapstick and cliche, disrupt the natural feel of the movie. The funniest sequences involve the self-titled 'Hot Metal' strippers - who have trouble comprehending dance moves unless they're related to positioning on a soccer field - attempting to master the strip-tease bump and grind (accompanied by a fabulous soundtrack of retro tunes, including Donna Summer and Hot Chocolate).",4,"""It's not bad - this stripping lark - is it?""",1025136000,"06 27, 2002",2002,1725,"['Full', 'Monty', 'right', 'good', 'laff', 'borrow', 'parlance', 'protagonists', 'dialect', 'may', 'occasionally', 'bewilder', 'viewers', 'unused', 'north-England', 'speech', 'humour', ""n't"", 'need', 'translation', 'Gaz', 'down', 'luck', 'possessed', 'endless', 'supply', 'far-fetched', 'money-making', 'schemes', 'Inspired', 'visit', 'renowned', 'Chippendale', 'male', 'strip-show', 'artists', 'hometown', 'Sheffield', 'impressed', 'huge', 'amounts', 'money', 'make', 'seemingly', 'just', 'taking', 'off', 'clothes', 'prancing', 'around', 'bit', 'Gaz', 'ticket', 'fast', 'cash.Part', 'reason', 'film', 'likeable', 'humour', 'realism', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'depressing', 'backdrop', 'industrial', 'town', 'high', 'unemployment', 'Gaz', 'cobble', 'together', 'troupe', 'six', 'unlikely', 'strippers', 'including', 'suicidal', 'security', 'worker', 'man', 'dodgy', 'hip', 'well-endowed', 'bathroom', 'repairman', 'guys', 'are', ""n't"", 'super-studs', ""'re"", 'just', 'ordinary', 'blokes', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'give', 'shot', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'get', 'rich.The', 'film', 'Gaz', 'friend', 'Dave', 'becoming', 'marooned', 'partially', 'submerged', 'car', 'middle', 'canal', 'unanticipated', 'result', 'one', 'Gaz', 'plans', 'originality', 'comedy', 'So', 'fresh', 'humour', 'occasional', 'moments', 'when', 'level', 'slapstick', 'cliche', 'disrupt', 'natural', 'feel', 'movie', 'funniest', 'sequences', 'involve', 'self-titled', ""'Hot"", 'Metal', 'strippers', 'who', 'have', 'trouble', 'comprehending', 'dance', 'moves', ""'re"", 'related', 'positioning', 'soccer', 'field', 'attempting', 'master', 'strip-tease', 'bump', 'grind', 'accompanied', 'fabulous', 'soundtrack', 'retro', 'tunes', 'including', 'Donna', 'Summer', 'Hot', 'Chocolate']",Full Monty VHS

Side stories  like the theft of garden gnomes and the act of offering to fix a man's car  so that he can gas himself are classic examples of off-beat British  humour.There is also a lot of warm human interest in this film. We see  the relationship between Gaz (Robert Carlyle) and his son and his ex-wife.  Also, the relationships between his friends and their wives.In all  cases, the men had lost self respect and, through the act of former  workmates getting together again and making new work for themselves they  recaptured their self respect, regain the respect of others and most  importantly to them, they realise that they are important to their friends  and families.Often films with such a lot of fun and feel good factor  leave me feeling that they are too sickly sweet and aim at some lowest  common denominator.

His reaction to seeing the video box? ""I'm already not feeling well. I don't want to watch a movie about a bunch of male strippers prancing around."" And then we put in the movie and couldn't stop laughing.""The Full Monty"" is about so much more than male strippers. The film centers around out-of-work steelworkers trying to cope with life now that their mill is shut down. The movie realistically explores male friendship, men's feelings about failing their wives' expectations, devotion to family, coping with loss,... but in ways that do not become depressing.The stripper plan comes about because Gaz (Robert Carlyle) needs to come up with money to bring his child support current so that he can continue seeing his son. The father-son relationship is one of the most touching aspects of the movie.  Gaz's son, Nate, tags along with Gaz as he tries to put together a Chippendale-style show to catch up on his child support.  [As an aside, ""The Full Monty"" and ""A Thousand Clowns"" with Jason Robards would be an interesting pair of movies to see together as a starting point for examining what makes a good father.]The relationships between the dancers that Mark Addy and Carlyle assemble is fun to watch. Tom Wilkison (also seen in ""The Patriot"", ""In the Bedroom"", and ""Moulin Rouge"") is excellent as their former supervisor who turns to dancing to cover his wife's extravagant spending. Addy is equally good as Gaz's chubby friend who is struggling with his marriage: His wife wants him to take a job in a local variety store.

A one-night Chippendales show comes to town and is a big hit, so they decide to make their own strip show, and to make it more interesting they'll go completely nude!  The men are neither big and buff nor good dancers, but they put their hearts into preparing for the big night.This absolutely charming comedy has many touching moments, thanks to the well-developed and sympathetic characters we come to know:  One is a divorced dad (Robert Carlyle) who needs to raise child support money, one is an overweight and depressed husband (Mark Addy), one cares for his aging mum, and one (Tom Wilkinson) hasn't had the nerve to tell his credit card-happy wife that he's been out of work for six months.  All of the actors are perfectly cast and it's worth the price just to see the venerable Wilkinson bump and grind to ""Hot Stuff.""Gritty location photography and a lively, Oscar-winning disco soundtrack help create the mood of despair giving way to hope.

His primary motivation for this enterprise is to come up with child support money so he can spend time with his son.The human interest story is what makes you root for these characters.  There is strong language, a scene of attempted suicide, impotence, strong male sexuality, and a homosexual scene.

It originates in the story line: a group of recently-unemployed men in sooty olde England decide to form a Chippendales style dance troupe. Their plan, at the end of their act, is to remove the last velcroed jock-strap and expose `the full monty'.The story line is crowded with the usual film tropes: relationships with family and friends are strained and tested. The men, initially overwhelmed by the decay of the industry that's been their livelihood gain strength as they take arms (and legs and torsos) against their sea of troubles. The men themselves are charming and their story is inspiring.It is worth noting that ""FULLY EXPOSED EDITION"" is a canard.

""Sheffield Is A City On The Move!"" - the plumy-voiced commentator enthuses. ""Millions flock here...browsing in its shops! The jewel in Yorkshire's Northern Crown!"" But then the cheesy music and his 1970's confidence fade away...It's 25 years later - and Gary 'Gaz' Schofield and David 'Dave' Horsefall (Robert Carlyle and Mark Addy) are on their way home from an unsuccessful plunder run in the disused Steel Works Factory they were employed in ten years earlier (stealing 20 girders to pay maintenance money). They see a huge queue of local lasses excitedly waiting outside the Millthorpe Working Men's Club to see a strip gig by a visiting male troupe - The Chippendales. These six-pack dancing lotharios will be there `For One Night Only' - all buffed up, covered in Johnson's baby oil and wearing tiny detachable red leather sarongs around their presumably mighty nether regions. ""Waving his tackle at your missus!"" Gaz ruminates to Dave - appalled and amazed at such a thought. But back at the Job Club (which never has any jobs) - Gaz and his mates calculate that at 10 per punter - times a thousand screaming girlies - that's a lot of wonga that our unemployed Sex Gods don't have stuffed down into their well manky Marks & Spencer Y-Fronts.To make matters worse - Gaz's son Nathan (William Snape) is with his ex-wife Mandy (the lovely Emily Woof) who is shacking up with a 'decent' man - Alan. Alan has a job (Dave Hill), a home and can afford the 700 a month it costs to raise a child. Besides - although he loves him - young Nate is tired of Dad's excuses, scams and getting by. Gaz now knows that he will need to pull out all the stops to keep his son - but he also twigs that in order to outdo the muscle-bound competition - he and his crew of Little and Large lookalikes (who call themselves HOT METAL) will have to pull out a bit more than a stop - they'll need to get their entire kit off - and do The Full Monty. An idea is planted, secret striptease practice begins in living rooms and disused warehouses to Hot Chocolate's ""You Sexy Thing"" - and soon a lithesome pep is returned to their disco-dancing step...When ""The Full Monty"" was released into British cinemas in 1997 - it took the country by storm. It was brutally funny, topically apt and down to earth. And despite its dark back-story about the sapping effect of unemployment - it was properly uplifting in a way that only ballsy English comedy can be. But most of all - it had what the British Government has never had - genuine heart.So many scenes in this film are gigglesome funny  - the striptease to ""Je T'Aime...Moi Non Plus"" by a man about as sexy as an Orang-Utan picking his nose, discussing ways of effectively killing yourself after they've saved the ginger-haired wimp Lomper (Steve Hulson) from gassing himself in his clapped-out Cortina, their former Foreman and Boss Gerald (a stunning turn by Tom Wilkinson) worrying about getting a stiffy in front of 400 women like he did when he was a kid of 13 in a swimming pool full of teenage girls, the ageing black man Horse (Paul Barber) bemoaning the lack of results from a penis-pump in a red telephone box, Guy (Hugo Speer) dropping his pants and revealing his ample dangler (""The lunchbox has landed!""), the boys swaying their hips and behinds to Donna Summer's ""Hot Stuff"" as the dole queue shuffles forward...But then it touches you too - cooking a curry on a hot engine head because they're broke and hungry, the girls using the men's toilets at the Chippendales gig when Dave's wife Jean (Lesley Sharp) stops laughing and says of her husband ""It's like he's given up...work...me...everything..."" But especially when Lomper's aging Mum dies and he plays the trumpet at her funeral accompanied by The British Steel Stockbridge Brass Band to a truly gorgeous version of ""Abide With Me"" (not a dry eye in the house).Having watched the DVD before the BLU RAY - I'm thrilled to say that the picture quality is vastly improved. It's beautiful - and that's not something you'd say of a film like this (it was never meant to be a looker). There isn't a scratch or a speck to be seen and the steadiness of the image and the extra oomph in the mix allows both the picture and music to punch way above its weight (a top transfer).The Extras are pleasingly indepth - Two Commentaries - one by Director Peter Cattaneo and Actor Mark Addy- the other by Principal Producer Uberto Pasolini. There are 1998 interviews with actors Robert Carlyle, Mark Addy, Hugo Speer, Paul Barber, Steve Hulson and even a very young William Snape beside himself to have gotten the child gig.  There are Deleted Scenes, nearly 15 different trailers in various publicity campaigns, a function called ""Music Machine"" that allows you play one or all of the songs featured in the film, Derek Malcolm interviews with Producer Uberto Pasolini and Backer Lindsay Law (of Fox Searchlight), Director Peter Cattaneo, Writer Simon Beaufoy and actor Tom Wilkinson. There's even stuff of the aftermath of the film and its success.AUDIO is English 5.1 DTS-HD, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian 5.1 DTS, Castellano 5.1 DTS. SUBTITLES are English For The Deaf and Hard Of Hearing, Portuguese, Japanese, Castellano, Italian, Spanish and Japanese. Coding is ABC so all regions.Mark Addy's character is Dave - the plumpest of the bunch and the most embarrassed about his body shape. In front of his wife - he breaks down and admits his fears - ""Well look at me! Janey - who wants to see 'this' dance?"" She tenderly steps up to him, puts her hands on his face and says - ""Me Dave. I do.""""The Full Monty"" is a fabulous film - just as funny and as moving as you remember it.

The result is believability and dignity of each character, even while they find themselves in very undignified circumstances.As a side note, The ""translator"" section in the Special Features is puzzling to me because they translate slang terms with which most Americans are already familiar, i.e., ""DIY,"" ""tw-t,"" etc., but leave out British oddities that are unknown in the USA, such as ""chuffing Nora"" ""kit,"" and ""taking the piss"" and some terms that, after repeated viewings, still sound like gobbledygook to the average American.  No matter. Everyone I know who has seen the film understood what was going on.This film is not raunchy, tacky, or vulgar, so do not let the premise put you off.

436285,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6304813759,Reviewer,"[3, 4]","This film has some moments of hilarity that will make you laugh until you cry; but it also has moments that will cause some reflection.  And in the end, it's actually somewhat gentle fare, considering the subject matter, which on the surface may seem wont to lend itself to a much coarser interpretation.  Rest assured, however, ""The Full Monty,"" directed by Peter Cattaneo, is a fun-filled excursion that skirts some serious issues while warmly embracing the more humorous aspects of the human condition.  It's a telling study of desperation without the misery, of loss without the moroseness, and finally it's an upbeat, uplifting tale of pursuing possibilities, and what it means to reach for the rainbow in the wake of the storm.The film opens with a clip that could've been prepared by any local chamber of commerce, touting the city of Sheffield, England, as a growing concern in the industrial market, a veritable city on the move.  The story then quickly jumps ahead twenty-five years, and we find that the once booming steel business has been quieted, the mill closed down indefinitely.  Which means, of course, that many able bodied workers are out of a job, and their prospects for the future are less than bleak.  Among those forced to go on the dole are Gaz Schofield (Robert Carlyle) and his friend, Dave (Mark Addy), whose lives become especially complicated by their current status of ""unemployed.""  Unable to make child support payments, Gaz is about to lose visitation rights with his son, Nathan (William Snape), and losing his job has left Dave emasculated, leading to problems with his wife, Jean (Lesley Sharp).Then one night the ""Chippendales"" show arrives in town, and for the ""ladies only"" performance, the local venue is sold out, at ten quid a head.  And after having a quick peek at the dancers for himself, inspiration suddenly strikes Gaz, who figures if a bunch of ""puffers"" like the Chippendales can cause such a stir, why not some local talent?  Like himself, Dave, and whoever else he can get to jump on the bandwagon with him.  The kicker is, Gaz knows that they're going to have to go the Chippendales one up; and that means going ""The Full Monty.""  If they're going to pack `em in, they're going to have to go all the way...Peter Cattaneo is to be commended for handling so sensitive a subject and the accompanying issues with such warmth and humor.  Let's face it, a story about a bunch of guys who resort to ""stripping"" in order to survive could have gone in an entirely different direction.  But thanks to the insights of Cattaneo and screenwriter Simon Beaufoy, the result is a film that reaches out and touches the humanity in us all.  The characters are all richly drawn and delivered by Cattaneo through his actors with great care.  These are very real people with whom anyone past the age of majority will be able to identify, in one way or another.  And that's what really sells the film.  Cattaneo keeps it all very real and down-to-earth, sets an effective pace and backs it all up with a terrific soundtrack of contemporary music.  Who will be able to come away from this film NOT at least humming Hot Chocolate's ""You Sexy Thing,"" or thinking about the scene in which ""Horse"" (Paul Barber) ""auditions"" to Wilson Pickett's ""Land of 1000 Dances?""  Or when the guys, after having rehearsed for awhile, are on line at the employment office when Donna Summer's ""Hot Stuff"" comes on and they can't keep still.  Cattaneo takes a positive approach to negative issues, wraps it all up in humility, humanity and hard work, and in doing so he gives his audience a film that is highly entertaining, emotionally involving and unforgettable.Heading up the ensemble cast, Robert Carlyle is right on with his portrayal of Gaz.  He completely captures the blue collar, working class image and attitude that defines his character so succinctly.  And he convincingly conveys the fact that he doesn't know one ""beat"" from another, as evidenced by the way he is ""always ahead"" of the rest, regardless of which piece of music they're dancing to.Mark Addy captures the essence of who these guys are, as well, giving a memorable performance as Dave.  His is an extremely sensitive portrayal of of a man dealing with some very personal problems, which he addresses through his character quite believably.  And, in Dave's case, especially, Addy manages to elicit empathy without making him unduly sympathetic, which affords him, as well as the others and the film, the ability to maintain a semblance of dignity in the face of adversity, which is essentially one of the main tenets of the story.Also turning in an effective performance is Tom Wilkinson as Gerald, the former foreman of the steel mill, now reduced to being just one of the guys, and on the dole along with the rest of them.  Wilkinson brings to light the fact that Gerald's issues are somewhat different from the rest initially, but he gradually develops his character to the extent that you finally understand that Gerald is not so different from Gaz or Dave or the others after all.  And it's Wilkinson's insightful portrayal that more than any of the others cements that sense of community which is, in the end, the great equalizer of the species.The supporting cast includes Steve Huison (Lomper), Hugo Speer (Guy), Emily Woof (Mandy), Deirdre Costello (Linda), Paul Butterworth (Barry), Dave Hill (Alan) and Bruce Jones (Reg).  In reality, losing one's means of survival can be a devastating experience.  And what Cattaneo has done with ""The Full Monty"" is establish a sense of hope for those who may find themselves one day in the ""outbox"" of life, and he's done it with style, class and that most necessary of all of life's ingredients, humor.  This is a film to embrace-- and to enjoy over and over again.",5,Funny and Insightful,1030924800,"09 2, 2002",2002,5803,"['film', 'moments', 'hilarity', 'will', 'make', 'cry', 'also', 'moments',

They agree to do a strip show for a few bucks, but with one slight twist--they'll take EVERYTHING off! Robert Carlyle (who was downright scary as Begbie in ""Trainspotting"") has never been funnier and so at ease onscreen, and the other supporting cast memebers (including Tom Wilkinson) are also good. A great movie about following your dreams, physical appearance, and beating the odds. So why the mere 4-star rating?

436303,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,6304813759,"Tiggah ""the Anglophile""","[18, 18]","This classic (albeit very modern) 1997 British film, which I have seen a few times now, is one of my favourites.  The storyline is highly original, very funny, and hugely entertaining overall, but it's also heartwarming.  The setting is Sheffield, England, world famous for its steel.  Sadly Sheffield, like most of the North of England, has had to deal with massive unemployment; in Sheffield's case, it's a result of the collapse of the steel industry.  Briefly, the story revolves around six unemployed men, victims of the times, who aspire to ""putting on"" a one-night-only ""full monty"" (British slang for ""taking it ALL off"") strip show to raise some much-needed cash.The idea is actually the brain-child of one of the men, Gaz (played by Robert Carlyle (The World is Not Enough)), who is in arrears in his maintenance payments for his son (who lives with Gaz's ex-wife and her new boyfriend).  Gaz is at risk of losing joint custody and fears he may lose his son altogether.  His motivation (and indeed his desperation) in coming up with such an outrageous scheme is, therefore, both plausible and understandable, for the men stand to pocket a nice little sum of money if they can, quite literally, pull it off.  The film, which is 95 minutes, also features Tom Wilkinson (Essex Boys), who plays the lads' former boss from the steel factory, and Paul Barber (Denzil from Only Fools and Horses).In conclusion, I highly recommend this film to fans of British comedy in general, but I think its appeal is broad enough to be enjoyed by anyone looking for a thoroughly enjoyable comedy with a really good storyline.  Just one thing: Viewers ought to be prepared for fairly thick Yorkshire accents.  This may be a bit of a shock at first for the unfamiliar, but close attention helps and it is well worth the effort.  It's a cute story that is superbly acted and very well presented.  What's more, it's a film that can be enjoyed time and again.Very highly recommended!",5,A Thoroughly Entertaining British Comedy!,1034899200,"10 18, 2002",2002,1968,"['classic', 'albeit', 'very', 'modern', '1997', 'British', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'times', 'now', 'one', 'favourites', 'storyline', 'highly', 'original', 'very', 'funny', 'hugely', 'entertaining', 'overall', 'also', 'heartwarming', 'setting', 'Sheffield', 'England', 'world', 'famous', 'steel', 'Sadly', 'Sheffield', 'most', 'North', 'England', 'had', 'deal', 'massive', 'unemployment', 'Sheffield', 'case', 'result', 'collapse', 'steel', 'industry', 'Briefly', 'story', 'six', 'unemployed', 'men', 'victims', 'times', 'who', 'aspire', 'putting', 'one-night-only', 'full', 'monty', 'British', 'slang', 'taking', 'off', 'strip', 'show', 'raise', 'much-needed', 'cash.The', 'idea', 'actually', 'brain-child', 'one', 'men', 'Gaz', 'played', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'who', 'arrears', 'maintenance', 'payments', 'son', 'who', 'Gaz', 'ex-wife', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Gaz', 'risk', 'losing', 'joint', 'custody', 'fears', 'may', 'lose', 'son', 'altogether', 'motivation', 'indeed', 'desperation', 'coming', 'up', 'outrageous', 'scheme', 'therefore', 'plausible', 'understandable', 'men', 'stand', 'pocket', 'nice', 'little', 'sum', 'money', 'can', 'quite', 'literally', 'pull', 'off', 'film', '95', 'minutes', 'also', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Essex', 'Boys', 'who', 'lads', 'former', 'boss', 'steel', 'factory', 'Paul', 'Barber', 'Denzil', 'Only', 'Fools', 'Horses', '.In', 'conclusion', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'British', 'comedy', 'general', 'think', 'appeal', 'broad', 'enough', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'anyone', 'looking', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'comedy', 'really', 'good', 'storyline', 'Just', 'one', 'thing', 'Viewers', 'ought', 'be', 'prepared', 'fairly', 'thick', 'Yorkshire', 'accents', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'shock', 'first', 'unfamiliar', 'close', 'attention', 'well', 'effort', 'cute', 'story', 'superbly', 'acted', 'very', 'well', 'presented', 'What', 'more', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'time', 'again.Very', 'highly', 'recommended']",Full Monty VHS
