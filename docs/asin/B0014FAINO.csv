It is very interesting to watch the emotions of the police as well as the defense attorney.  You see that each side is upholding the principles in which it believes. They remain honest through out the process. I was very glad that I purchased this series of shows. I do not remember seeing these when they initially aired.

1146766,A3875KWK1PXG7I,B0014FAINO,Robert Huggins,"[21, 22]","This is the second nine-episode DVD release of ""Arrest and Trial,"" the 1963-64 police and legal drama that's said to have influenced the modern day ""Law & Order"" series.  If you've seen the first DVD set released by the Timeless Media Group and enjoyed it, you will undoubtedly want to include this second release in your collection.  The first half of each episode, The Arrest, begins with the crime and subsequent investigation by LAPD detectives portrayed by Ben Gazzara and Roger Perry.  The second half of the show, The Trial, features defense attorneys portrayed by Chuck Connors and Don Galloway pitted against lawyers from the district attorney's office, portrayed by John Larch and John Kerr.As I watch this second collection of episodes, I'm struck by the similarity in execution to some of the other great television dramas of the early 1960s, ""Naked City"" and ""Route 66.""  Like those other classics, the recurring characters of ""Arrest and Trial"" are often secondary to the guest stars that appear as the accused or as those who are close to the crime.  In the episode ""The Witnesses,"" Anne Francis plays a high school teacher who is having an affair with a married man, a high powered corporate lawyer (Robert Webber).  The couple witnesses a murder, but can't come forward due to the nature of their illicit affair.  Despite reassurances from her lover that everything will come out right, it becomes apparent that the wrong man will be convicted, and Ms. Francis experiences a crisis of conscience.  While the ending is predictable, it's the outstanding performance by Anne Francis that carries this episode.An interesting side note on ""Arrest and Trial"" is actor John Kerr who played Assistant Deputy District Attorney Barry Pine.  The experiences of portraying a lawyer on television must have made a positive impression on Mr. Kerr, who later entered UCLA's law school in 1966, and became a successful civil trial attorney, practicing law for 30 years in Southern California.Despite Timeless Media's claim that the episodes were ""faithfully reproduced from the original NBC masters,"" these episodes look no better or worse than the episodes contained in the first release,Arrest and Trial.  If, indeed, the episodes were reproduced from the NBC masters, they do not appear to be restored or cleaned up in any way, shape or form.  Some of the episodes in the first set were missing their opening title sequence, but the title sequence appears on all episodes in this second set.  The episodes are very watchable, but for anyone expecting a high quality audio/visual presentation along the lines of some of CBS Paramount's vintage TV-on-DVD releases like ""The Fugitive"" or ""The Untouchables,"" you'll be soundly disappointed.  Still, it's the writing, acting and overall production values that are important and, on those counts, ""Arrest and Trial"" delivers.  Recommended.",4,More Arrests.

1146767,A3CJN2S0XLVVLM,B0014FAINO,Silver Screen Videos,"[0, 0]","The concept of combining police investigation and criminal trials did not being with Law and Order. Nearly thirty years earlier, Arrest and Trial originated the concept, right down to labeling the two halves of each 90-minue episode, ""The Arrest"" and ""The Trial.""Although the format varied a bit from show to show, usually in the first half of each episode, a group of cops led by Ben Gazzara would investigate a crime (as usually happened on TV of that era, generally a murder) and make an arrest around the 45-minute mark. At that point, in a departure from Law and Order, the focus shifted to defense attorney Chuck Connors, who tried to defend the accused.Some of these episodes were almost whodunnits in the Perry Mason mold, in which Connors tries to figure out just how the crime really occurred, while others were more like The Defenders, in which the show explored leading social and legal themes of the day, some of them still relevant today. Connors himself is surprisingly good as the attorney, for those who know him only from the Rifleman while Gazzara is as solid as always.The quality of the episodes was definitely mixed, with some of them being pale imitations of either Mason or the various cop shows of the era. Another drawback is the quality of audio and video. These are not studio prints but taken from existing copies of the episodes, some of them of a bit questionable quality. In addition, the 90-minute running time in some cases allowed for greater exploration of the issues (such as My Name is Martin Burnham, in which defendant James Whitmore won't even defend himself because he wants to die). However, in other episodes, the show simply wandered too much. My personal favorite, and an unusual episode for the time, was Journey into Darkness, in which Roddy McDowall is an arrogant would-be intellectual whom Connors has to defend even though he knows McDowall is guilty.My actual review for this set would be 2 1/2 stars owing to the mixed quality of the episodes in the set. However, if you're a fan of old time television as I am, there's a lot of fun in seeing vets Connors and Gazzara, not to mention some highly talented guest stars, to make this a marginal recommendation.For people interested in seeing the series, you may be able to find better value elsewhere. The show ran one season with 30 episodes. This set contains nine episodes and another set (Arrest and Trial) contains another nine (the episodes in this set are taken at random from various times in the show's run). However, the complete series, featuring all 30 episodes, is also available for about the price of these two shorter box sets combined.",3,Forgotten Precursor to Law and Order Is Worth Catching,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,2653,"['concept', 'combining', 'police', 'investigation', 'criminal', 'trials', 'did', 'not', 'being', 'Law', 'Order', 'Nearly', 'thirty', 'years', 'earlier', 'Arrest', 'Trial', 'originated', 'concept', 'right', 'down', 'labeling', 'two', 'halves', '90-minue', 'episode', 'Arrest', 'Trial', 'format', 'varied', 'bit', 'show', 'show', 'usually', 'first', 'half', 'episode', 'group', 'cops', 'led', 'Ben', 'Gazzara', 'would', 'investigate', 'crime', 'usually', 'happened', 'TV', 'era', 'generally', 'murder', 'make', 'arrest', '45-minute', 'mark', 'point', 'departure', 'Law', 'Order', 'focus', 'shifted', 'defense', 'attorney', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'who', 'tried', 'defend', 'accused.Some', 'episodes', 'were', 'almost', 'whodunnits', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'mold', 'Connors', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'crime', 'really', 'occurred', 'others', 'were', 'more', 'Defenders', 'show', 'explored', 'leading', 'social', 'legal', 'themes', 'day', 'still', 'relevant', 'today', 'Connors', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'attorney', 'who', 'know', 'only', 'Rifleman', 'Gazzara', 'as', 'solid', 'always.The', 'quality', 'episodes', 'was', 'definitely', 'mixed', 'being', 'pale', 'imitations', 'Mason', 'various', 'cop', 'shows', 'era', 'drawback', 'quality', 'audio', 'video', 'are', 'not', 'studio', 'prints', 'taken', 'existing', 'copies', 'episodes', 'bit', 'questionable', 'quality', 'addition', '90-minute', 'running', 'time', 'cases', 'allowed', 'greater', 'exploration', 'issues', 'such', 'My', 'Name', 'Martin', 'Burnham', 'defendant', 'James', 'Whitmore', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'defend', 'die', 'However', 'other', 'episodes', 'show', 'simply', 'wandered', 'too', 'much', 'personal', 'favorite', 'unusual', 'episode', 'time', 'was', 'Journey', 'Darkness', 'Roddy', 'McDowall', 'arrogant', 'would-be', 'intellectual', 'whom', 'Connors', 'defend', 'even', 'McDowall', 'guilty.My', 'actual', 'review', 'set', 'would', 'be', '2', '1/2', 'stars', 'owing', 'mixed', 'quality', 'episodes', 'set', 'However', ""'re"", 'fan', 'old', 'time', 'television', 'am', 'lot', 'fun', 'seeing', 'vets', 'Connors', 'Gazzara', 'not', 'mention', 'highly', 'talented', 'guest', 'stars', 'make', 'marginal', 'recommendation.For', 'people', 'interested', 'seeing', 'series', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'better', 'value', 'elsewhere', 'show', 'ran', 'one', 'season', '30', 'episodes', 'set', 'nine', 'episodes', 'set', 'Arrest', 'Trial', 'nine', 'episodes', 'set', 'are', 'taken', 'random', 'various', 'times', 'show', 'run', 'However', 'complete', 'series', 'featuring', '30', 'episodes', 'also', 'available', 'price', 'two', 'shorter', 'box', 'sets', 'combined']","Arrest and Trial, Part 2"
