Some of the poses were a bit too much for a pregnant women so it shocked me that the women in the video were doing them.

Even though I am NOT expecting (and haven't been for many, many years!) I found the cardio to be low-impact and fun. I wish there was an option for a longer cardio section, but I just did it twice. The strength portion is very basic and uses a chair to help with balance, something an expecting woman might need! The stretch was very soothing as well. All in all, this is a nice, gentle workout whether you are expecting or not!",5,"Gentle, Low Impact Workout; Great Even If You Are NOT Expecting :-)",1404172800,"07 1, 2014",2014,561,"['am', 'intermediate', 'exerciser', 'mid', '50', ""'ve"", 'been', 'paring', 'down', 'workout', 'collection', '34', 'Kinder-Gentler', '34', 'workouts', 'Even', 'am', 'NOT', 'expecting', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'found', 'cardio', 'be', 'low-impact', 'fun', 'wish', 'was', 'option', 'longer', 'cardio', 'section', 'just', 'did', 'twice', 'strength', 'portion', 'very', 'basic', 'chair', 'help', 'balance', 'something', 'expecting', 'woman', 'might', 'need', 'stretch', 'was', 'very', 'soothing', 'as', 'well', 'nice', 'gentle', 'are', 'expecting', 'not']",What To Expect When You're Expecting - Workout
1594232,A5ASHVZ00V1ZZ,B009AVCADK,Renee,"[3, 6]",This in my second pregnancy and I'm 3 months in. I've been feeling exhausted and tired so thought I'd give this a try and absolutely loved it.  I'm not a highly active girl to start with so I like that you can mix and match work out to fit your level and schedule. The 10 minutes sections make it easy to break up your workout through out the day if you have a busy schedule or an energetic toddler. The DVD also offers sections on how to work out with a birthing ball or get in some exercises at work.,5,Love it!,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2013,502,"['second', 'pregnancy', ""'m"", '3', 'months', ""'ve"", 'been', 'feeling', 'exhausted', 'tired', 'so', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'try', 'absolutely', 'loved', ""'m"", 'not', 'highly', 'active', 'girl', 'start', 'so', 'like', 'can', 'mix', 'match', 'work', 'fit', 'level', 'schedule', '10', 'minutes', 'sections', 'make', 'easy', 'break', 'up', 'workout', 'day', 'have', 'busy', 'schedule', 'energetic', 'toddler', 'DVD', 'also', 'sections', 'how', 'work', 'out', 'birthing', 'ball', 'get', 'exercises', 'work']",What To Expect When You're Expecting - Workout
1594233,A2CH6Q309ULPER,B009AVCADK,Sdreprlcr,"[3, 5]","I love that each segment is only 10 minutes. The 3 cardio segments were challenging, but not overly so. It was very much like aerobics, and sometimes hard to follow since it was fast paced. I am sure after doing those segments a few times, it will be easier. The Mind, Body, Baby segment was very nice and relaxing. There were several stretches on there that I had never even tried before. Cute to the Core was the easiest work out segment (not counting the mind/body segment of course!), and Buns in the oven was challenging for me. There was also upper body work on that one, too.This DVD has a good mix of intensities, and has a customizable feature where you can pick and chose what workouts to play.",5,Great Workout,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,704,"['love', 'segment', 'only', '10', 'minutes', '3', 'cardio', 'segments', 'were', 'challenging', 'not', 'overly', 'so', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'aerobics', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'follow', 'was', 'fast', 'paced', 'am', 'sure', 'doing', 'segments', 'few', 'times', 'will', 'be', 'easier', 'Mind', 'Body', 'Baby', 'segment', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'relaxing', 'were', 'several', 'stretches', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'tried', 'Cute', 'Core', 'was', 'easiest', 'work', 'out', 'segment', 'not', 'counting', 'mind/body', 'segment', 'course', 'Buns', 'oven', 'was', 'challenging', 'was', 'also', 'upper', 'body', 'work', 'one', 'too.This', 'DVD', 'good', 'mix', 'intensities', 'customizable', 'feature', 'where', 'can', 'pick', 'chose', 'what', 'play']",What To Expect When You're Expecting - Workout
