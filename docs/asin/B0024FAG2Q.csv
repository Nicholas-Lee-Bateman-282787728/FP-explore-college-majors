1249863,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B0024FAG2Q,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[0, 0]","John Cassavetes was a filmmaker who made his independent films in two primary modes: brilliant character-driven masterpieces like Faces, The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie, and Opening Night, or interesting character-driven mediocrities with `moments,' like Shadows, A Woman Under The Influence, and Gloria. His 1970 film, Husbands, however, falls somewhere in between. It's nowhere near a great film, for it is poorly edited and, surprisingly, poorly scripted, most of the time. But, there are certain scenes that are not overly long and utterly pointless. And in these scenes lie the seeds for what could have been a brilliant, if not great, film. As it is, though, the 142 minute DVD version of the film, released by Columbia and Sony Pictures, plays out more like the opening scene of the film that came before it, Faces. That film had an opening scene of drunken revelry and misery of the sort never before committed to celluloid. The difference is that it, for all its greatness and minor flaws, ran only about 20 minutes into that film. Now, extend that scene and try to cobble and sustain a film narrative about seven times its length, and the problems with Husbands becomes obvious. It simply needed the touch of a good editor.Proof of this claim comes, in fact, from the brief final scene of the film where the character played by Cassavetes himself (Gus) returns home after a drunken weekend in London, England, with two other buddies mourning the loss of a fourth pal, to confront his crying daughter and mischievous son in his driveway, as they call on there never seen mom to tell her that daddy is home to take his lumps. This scene is poetic, spare, and filled with realism. By contrast, far too many scenes in Husbands are bloated, overly long, pointless, and prosaic- in the worst sense. The whole film opens with still photos of four fortyish male friends, then cuts to the funeral of one of them, Stu (in the photos portrayed by Cassavetes' wife, Gena Rowlands' real life brother, David Rowlands). Interestingly, the putative main character of the film makes his exit from the film at this point. Another good touch, in fact, is that, save for the wife of Harry (Ben Gazzara)- who works at an advertising agency, in a brief scene of domestic violence, no other wives make an appearance. The two other surviving members of the male quartet are Gus (Cassavetes himself)- a dentist, and Archie (Peter Falk)- profession unknown.No amount of rewatching can exorcise the screenplay's flaws which make this film merely a good and interesting one, rather than a masterpiece. Far too much testosterone in place of intelligence, and a too easy reliance on melodrama over real drama make the film something that a great film never is: soap operatic. A better editing job would have allowed the film to have been shaped into a coherent whole, rather than an often formless mess. The old maxim about films being made or broken in the editing room seems to have been uttered for films like this. Husbands is one of those films that, in a sense, makes one wish for what could have been, but is good enough that what is can satisfy, at least to a point. Beyond the point, though, the sky is how you make it.",3,Good,1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,3208,"['John', 'Cassavetes', 'was', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'made', 'independent', 'films', 'two', 'primary', 'modes', 'brilliant', 'character-driven', 'masterpieces', 'Faces', 'Killing', 'A', 'Chinese', 'Bookie', 'Opening', 'Night', 'interesting', 'character-driven', 'mediocrities', 'moments', 'Shadows', 'A', 'Woman', 'Influence', 'Gloria', '1970', 'film', 'Husbands', 'however', 'somewhere', 'nowhere', 'great', 'film', 'poorly', 'edited', 'surprisingly', 'poorly', 'scripted', 'most', 'time', 'are', 'certain', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'overly', 'long', 'utterly', 'pointless', 'scenes', 'lie', 'seeds', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'brilliant', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'though', '142', 'minute', 'DVD', 'version', 'film', 'released', 'Columbia', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'out', 'more', 'opening', 'scene', 'film', 'came', 'Faces', 'film', 'had', 'opening', 'scene', 'drunken', 'revelry', 'misery', 'sort', 'never', 'before', 'committed', 'celluloid', 'difference', 'greatness', 'minor', 'flaws', 'ran', 'only', 'about', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'Now', 'extend', 'scene', 'try', 'cobble', 'sustain', 'film', 'narrative', 'seven', 'times', 'length', 'problems', 'Husbands', 'obvious', 'simply', 'needed', 'touch', 'good', 'editor.Proof', 'claim', 'fact', 'brief', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'character', 'played', 'Cassavetes', 'Gus', 'home', 'drunken', 'weekend', 'London', 'England', 'two', 'other', 'buddies', 'mourning', 'loss', 'fourth', 'pal', 'confront', 'crying', 'daughter', 'mischievous', 'son', 'driveway', 'call', 'never', 'seen', 'mom', 'tell', 'daddy', 'home', 'take', 'lumps', 'scene', 'poetic', 'spare', 'filled', 'realism', 'contrast', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'Husbands', 'are', 'bloated', 'overly', 'long', 'pointless', 'prosaic-', 'worst', 'sense', 'whole', 'film', 'opens', 'still', 'photos', 'four', 'fortyish', 'male', 'friends', 'then', 'funeral', 'one', 'Stu', 'photos', 'portrayed', 'Cassavetes', 'wife', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'real', 'life', 'brother', 'David', 'Rowlands', 'Interestingly', 'putative', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'exit', 'film', 'point', 'good', 'touch', 'fact', 'save', 'wife', 'Harry', 'Ben', 'Gazzara', 'who', 'advertising', 'agency', 'brief', 'scene', 'domestic', 'violence', 'other', 'wives', 'make', 'appearance', 'two', 'other', 'surviving', 'members', 'male', 'quartet', 'are', 'Gus', 'Cassavetes', 'dentist', 'Archie', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'profession', 'unknown.No', 'amount', 'rewatching', 'can', 'exorcise', 'screenplay', 'flaws', 'make', 'film', 'merely', 'good', 'interesting', 'one', 'rather', 'masterpiece', 'Far', 'too', 'much', 'testosterone', 'place', 'intelligence', 'too', 'easy', 'reliance', 'melodrama', 'real', 'drama', 'make', 'film', 'something', 'great', 'film', 'never', 'soap', 'operatic', 'better', 'editing', 'job', 'would', 'have', 'allowed', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'shaped', 'coherent', 'whole', 'rather', 'often', 'formless', 'mess', 'old', 'maxim', 'films', 'being', 'made', 'broken', 'editing', 'room', 'have', 'been', 'uttered', 'films', 'one', 'films', 'sense', 'one', 'wish', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'enough', 'what', 'can', 'satisfy', 'least', 'point', 'point', 'sky', 'how', 'make']",N/A

It's not a plot twist or plot device, it's not message he's trying to communicate to you intellectually (&#34;see these people and how lost they are ... this is my comment on middle-aged men ...&#34;).  With Cassavetes what he is always focused on is the human experience, human relationships, and those humans so happen to be his actors and himself.  So while you watch this movie, relax, have a drink or cigarette or whatever vice that you do, then do it, and watch a masterpiece of human emotions.  Because if you're not going to enjoy watching humans in all their complexity, if you don't find people interesting, then don't even other watching this film.

Yet it is Life itself.  It deals with living Life in the face of Death wherein the grim face of Finality is not directly looked upon.  It is about men looking to be Huck Finns one more time for a wild ride down the adventurous river of Life.I am glad the film is finally available on DVD, although it is not the fullest cut made by Cassavetes.  He went through many cuts, focusing on each of the three leads in each cut before finally balancing things out in the release version.  On this DVD (as opposed to the VHS) there are extended scenes in the bar/song contest/toilet sequence.  These are welcome.  I wish there were more.What I really wish is that ""Husbands"" had been given a Criterion release, as was done with ""The Killing of a Chinese Bookie.""  Why do I say this?  Mainly because the extra - a small featurette entitled ""The Making of Husbands: a Tribute to John Cassavetes"" sounds better than it is.  It is GREAT to see Ben Gazzara and hear his recollections and those of the producer and cinematographer, but other than that, well, that's it!  I was so hoping to hear some critical talking heads discuss why this film is so terrific - and I remember seeing Cassavetes/Falk and Gazzara on various talk shows at the time of the film's release (Dick Cavett for one) and I was so hoping that these contemporaneous interviews had been included.

They examine their own lives and see a lot of stuff they don't like.  It's the same stuff you and I surrender to every day, the constant rule-following and the constant role playing.  Husbands do this.  Fathers do that.  Workers do this.  Sons do that.  Then they realize that their prison bars are not on the outside, but are in their own minds.  So they fly to London because it's there and drink heavily, gamble until losing all of their money, and chase women down emotionally dead-end streets.  In the end, freedom is too scary to have all of the time.  Two of them return to home and family, but not unchanged.  Now they see that the roles we play and the rules we follow are empty lives, devoid of freedom, meaning, and emotion.  But the third buddy chooses freedom and refuses to be caged by the expectations of others.  ""What's he gonna do without us?"" asks his buddies in the final scene.This is one of my favorite films.  In 1970, it was way ahead of its time.  It must have looked to them like a lot of French movies do today.  The movie ends when they run out of film.  Cassavetes did the right thing spending a year editing his film to make it less funny and less entertaining.  This is not The Hangover.

1249870,AB8MSE5JHEG97,B0024FAG2Q,Thomas Plotkin,"[21, 21]","Three forty-ish professionals and best friends from Long Island go on a week-long bender in the wake of the fourth of their number dying suddenly of a heart attack. They play sports, go on an endless pub crawl, and eventually flee their wives and kids on an impulsive trip to London, where they set about pairing off with younger women. This is a very conventional sounding story, and director John Cassavetes, operating in the wake of the surprise success of his own film Faces and his acting appearences in two of the biggest hits of the late '60's (Rosemary's Baby and The Dirty Dozen) got studio backing and stars for Husbands, and shot a two hour mainstream male-bonding comedy that he screened to great success for MGM executives. He turned to co-star Peter Falk during the applause and whispered ""Remember that version -- because no-one's ever going to see it again.""He then spent a year making a completely different film in the editing room, taking out all the scenes of a conventional buddy comedy and putting in all the messy inconclusive momements in between the laughs and the plot points. What we get is three great actors -- Mephistophelian bad boy Cassavetes, wounded idealist Falk, and in a film-stealing performance, glowering kill-joy Ben Gazzara, get to the truth behind the arrested adolescence of male bonding.""I've never seen a helicopter explode. I've never seen anyone go and blow somebody's head off.  So why should I make a film about them?  But I have seen people destroy themselves in the smallest ways."" John Cassavetes.Cassavetes, even after his posthumous reputation has flourished as the very model of the off-Hollywood maverick independent film-maker, remains a polarizing figure to this day, and likely always will. His messy, plotless, chaotic, grueling actor-centered cinema aimed to present a narrow band of human emotions and a narrow strata of society in deliberately unflattering close-up.  They are as exhausting to watch as they must have been to make (a typical Cassavetes film took a year to write, a year to shoot, and a year to edit). Critics accused the films' faux improvised scripts, picking at small agonizing personal interactions like scabs for seemingly endless duration, as being no more than acting class exercises run self-indulgently amok: this is actually true, but this is also the source of JC's greatest insight. Cassavetes understood that social conditioning turns all of us into actors, forced to don a mask or pose to enact the various roles we are compelled to perform throughout our days, and that we are generally very bad actors to boot, full of forced laughter, cruel acts impulsively cracking the facade of niceness, self-pity undermining our cool. The moments in our lives where the mask starts to slip because our social performance has ceased to properly achieve what it was supposed to and we start blowing our lines because we don't actually understand why we are doing whatever it is we're doing are the moments his films are about. That is why they are so truthful and so painful to watch, not because of the sputtering inarticulateness of his characters, and meandering plots, the bad lighting and un-composed shots. Husbands is his toughest, most exhausting film, but if you can take it, it's worth the ride.What always saves a Cassavetes film from the precipice is that by the time the credits roll, we know his people as we know our own loved ones -- flawed, complex, mysterious. His compassion is like a tidal wave, but without a hint of sentiment. The film is also funny as hell, without a single line that resembles a joke.Cassavetes was the son of self-made Greek immigrants, and I have always found that significant: all those great Greek works that are thrown around so easily in our lexicon now apply to him: tyrant, democrat, anarchist, demogogue, autodidact, tragedian, comedian, daemon. He was all of these things, and ranks as one of the most important, if difficult of American film-makers.",5,Rat Pack In Extremis,1244332800,"06 7, 2009",2009,3984,"['Three', 'forty-ish', 'professionals', 'best', 'friends', 'Long', 'Island', 'go', 'week-long', 'bender', 'wake', 'fourth', 'number', 'dying', 'suddenly', 'heart', 'attack', 'play', 'sports', 'go', 'endless', 'pub', 'crawl', 'eventually', 'flee', 'wives', 'kids', 'impulsive', 'trip', 'London', 'where', 'set', 'pairing', 'off', 'younger', 'women', 'very', 'conventional', 'sounding', 'story', 'director', 'John', 'Cassavetes', 'operating', 'wake', 'surprise', 'success', 'own', 'film', 'Faces', 'acting', 'appearences', 'two', 'biggest', 'hits', 'late', ""'60"", 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Dirty', 'Dozen', 'got', 'studio', 'backing', 'stars', 'Husbands', 'shot', 'two', 'hour', 'mainstream', 'male-bonding', 'comedy', 'screened', 'great', 'success', 'MGM', 'executives', 'turned', 'co-star', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'applause', 'whispered', 'Remember', 'version', 'no-one', 'ever', 'going', 'see', 'again', 'then', 'spent', 'year', 'making', 'completely', 'different', 'film', 'editing', 'room', 'taking', 'out', 'scenes', 'conventional', 'buddy', 'comedy', 'putting', 'messy', 'inconclusive', 'momements', 'laughs', 'plot', 'points', 'What', 'get', 'three', 'great', 'actors', 'Mephistophelian', 'bad', 'boy', 'Cassavetes', 'wounded', 'idealist', 'Falk', 'film-stealing', 'performance', 'glowering', 'kill-joy', 'Ben', 'Gazzara', 'get', 'truth', 'arrested', 'adolescence', 'male', 'bonding', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'helicopter', 'explode', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anyone', 'go', 'blow', 'somebody', 'head', 'off', 'So', 'why', 'should', 'make', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'people', 'destroy', 'smallest', 'ways', 'John', 'Cassavetes.Cassavetes', 'even', 'posthumous', 'reputation', 'flourished', 'very', 'model', 'off-Hollywood', 'maverick', 'independent', 'film-maker', 'polarizing', 'figure', 'day', 'likely', 'always', 'will', 'messy', 'plotless', 'chaotic', 'grueling', 'actor-centered', 'cinema', 'aimed', 'present', 'narrow', 'band', 'human', 'emotions', 'narrow', 'strata', 'society', 'deliberately', 'unflattering', 'close-up', 'are', 'exhausting', 'watch', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'make', 'typical', 'Cassavetes', 'film', 'took', 'year', 'write', 'year', 'shoot', 'year', 'edit', 'Critics', 'accused', 'films', 'faux', 'improvised', 'scripts', 'picking', 'small', 'agonizing', 'personal', 'interactions', 'scabs', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'duration', 'being', 'more', 'acting', 'class', 'exercises', 'run', 'self-indulgently', 'amok', 'actually', 'true', 'also', 'source', 'JC', 'greatest', 'insight', 'understood', 'social', 'conditioning', 'actors', 'forced', 'don', 'mask', 'pose', 'enact', 'various', 'roles', 'are', 'compelled', 'perform', 'days', 'are', 'generally', 'very', 'bad', 'actors', 'boot', 'full', 'forced', 'laughter', 'cruel', 'acts', 'impulsively', 'cracking', 'facade', 'niceness', 'self-pity', 'undermining', 'cool', 'moments', 'lives', 'where', 'mask', 'slip', 'social', 'performance', 'ceased', 'properly', 'achieve', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'start', 'blowing', 'lines', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'understand', 'why', 'are', 'doing', ""'re"", 'doing', 'are', 'moments', 'films', 'are', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'truthful', 'so', 'painful', 'watch', 'not', 'sputtering', 'inarticulateness', 'characters', 'meandering', 'plots', 'bad', 'lighting', 'un-composed', 'shots', 'Husbands', 'toughest', 'most', 'exhausting', 'film', 'can', 'take', 'ride.What', 'always', 'Cassavetes', 'film', 'precipice', 'time', 'credits', 'roll', 'know', 'people', 'know', 'own', 'loved', 'ones', 'flawed', 'complex', 'mysterious', 'compassion', 'tidal', 'wave', 'hint', 'sentiment', 'film', 'also', 'funny', 'hell', 'single', 'line', 'joke.Cassavetes', 'was', 'son', 'self-made', 'Greek', 'immigrants', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'significant', 'great', 'Greek', 'works', 'are', 'thrown', 'so', 'easily', 'lexicon', 'now', 'apply', 'tyrant', 'democrat', 'anarchist', 'demogogue', 'autodidact', 'tragedian', 'comedian', 'daemon', 'was', 'things', 'ranks', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'difficult', 'American', 'film-makers']",N/A
