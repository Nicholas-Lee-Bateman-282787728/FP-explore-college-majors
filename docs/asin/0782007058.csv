Never for a moment do I believe that an inexperienced prosecutor (Andy Garcia) can be elected to become the District Attorney of the entire New York City area!  I might have a better chance of humiliating Shaq O'Neal on the basketball court.  Nonetheless, this story more than adequately confronts the age old questions:  where is the line to be drawn between adherence to the letter vs. the spirit of the law?  How much slack can officials representing the state cut those who do not perfectly obey the law?  Should we allow a relatively minor infraction to destroy a long and honorable career?  Should someone be handed the responsibility to prosecute a suspect accused of shooting their own father?  How much justice does an obviously guilty individual deserve?  Utopia is admittedly not possible on this side of the vale of tears.  What is the minimum, however, that is nonnegotiable?  This film has some weaknesses.

40508,A84UFSF2SZS2W,0782007058,"EriKa ""E""","[13, 15]","It seems like it was Andy Garcia week here on the Icelandic movie channel. Tonight this movie and another night Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead. Night Falls is a solidly good film. Garcia is great as a new attorney who is more seasoned than his fellow public attorneys because he is the son of a lifelong cop and has been a cop himself for many years. He studied law at night and became an attorney the hard way. When a surveillance operation on a drug dealer (on which his father has been working) goes awry, and Garcia's father (played by Ian Holm) is shot, the attorney general asks Garcia to try the case personally. The case is won easily, and Garcia beings a quick celebrity. He runs for election to become attorney general and wins. The subplot is the defence attorney (Richard Dreyfuss) for the drug dealer (who shot Garcia's father) introducing evidence that would potentially expose corruption in the police department. The case involving the stakeout proved that more than one precinct responded to the call for back up. Excessive use of authority and force come into play. People wanted to make sure that the drug dealer was killed in this operation because it became obvious that the drug dealers were paying off certain cops in order to keep them off their backs. Garcia discovers that his father's partner is one of the crooked cops (the crooked partner is played by James Gandolfini of the Sopranos. He always seemed so much like the supporting role actor in roles just like this one, but he seems to have made himself much more indispensable as Tony Soprano). Garcia confronts his father also, but the father claims to have no role in the corruption, although Garcia uncovers that the father forged the warrant for arrest that was used to arrest the drug dealer in the first place. The story is multilayered and shows the complexities that are faced in law enforcement and justice system everyday. Garcia's love interest is Lena Olin, who is an attorney for Richard Dreyfuss's firm. She discovers the forged warrant and could use it to overturn the conviction of the drug dealer but she chooses not to. Little decisions in life that bend the rules are the highlight of this film.

40514,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0782007058,Linda Linguvic,"[18, 19]","This 1997 film is based on a novel by James Daley and directed by Sidney Lumet, who also wrote the screenplay.  It's a fast-moving police procedural with constantly shifting questions about the law, political favors and what is really right and wrong.  There are quite a few obstacles in the path of righteousness, but in the end I was satisfied with the conclusion, which shows that justice does not always follow the strict letter of the law.Andy Garcia stars as a young assistant district attorney whose father, Ian Holm, is a cop who's been injured in a shootout with a drug dealer, played by Shiek Mamud-Bey.  Ron Liebman, the District Attorney, lets Garcia prosecute the case, which seems to be simple.  But the defense lawyer, played by Richard Dreyfus, introduces the concept of police corruption.  And so, even though the outcome of the case is clear, other issues come into play, especially since the young prosecutor's own father might be involved.The film moved fast, the plot deepening as the story moved along.  And it was nice to recognize two actors who later went on to fame in The Sopranos:  James Gandolfini is cast a cop and Dominic Chianese, who plays Uncle Junior, is cast as the judge.The story held my interest, the acting good and the ending was satisfactory and believable.

They are itching to get this scum off the streets and into the pen, so when their snitch tells them that the dealer is in the house they decide to make their move, search warrant in hand, guns raised. The younger cop radios in for back-up before the duo goes up. The dope dealer is however ready for them. He blasts through the door with a semi-automatic which riddles the old cop with bullets and finds an escape by killing two policemen with a silencer and stealing an unattended police cruiser...by the time the dealer escapes 3 districts of cops are on the scene.The district attorney assigns neophyte assistant under-District attorney Andy Garcia the case to get this guy, because the DA figures it's nothing but good publicity if the son of the cop who got riddled with bullets try the case to get the dealer off the streets...good publicity could mean re-election (even campaigning for the  mayor's seat) to the DA. The under DA does a great job of prosecuting the drug dealing and bests the Defense's Dershowitzian attorney, which makes him the 'it Boy' in the city. Because the DA gets sick, Garcia runs for the DA's position and he wins....that's when the stuff starts hitting the fan.I know this is a story whose plot has often been trod, but it makes for an entertaining view time anyway; you DO get the feel that the makers really didn't know what to do with some of the co-stars. Lena Olin, who seems too mature to play the smitten lover role here, (but is still babelicious, dig?) initially comes off as someone who is gonna turn in the Garcia's dad because of that forged Search warrant, but she melts: Gandolfini seems like he's about to rat on his partner for taking some kick backs, but he ends up shooting himself in the head instead....their facial expressions didn't match what they were gonna do. They must've been writing script and dialog along the way...anyway you can get a load of Junior Soprano Chianese playing a judge (of all things) and a youngish Gandolfini playing street cop.",3,"Decent Noo Yawk Corruption Melodrama, But....",1109030400,"02 22, 2005",2005,2305,"['..is', 'Ron', 'Lieberman', 'prototypical', 'overacting', 'DA', 'crime', 'punishment', 'dramas', 'who', 'told', 'Dreyfuss', 'could', 'channel', 'Allan', 'Dershowitz', 'Story', 'Two', 'cops', 'are', 'staking', 'out', 'most', 'wanted', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Harlem', 'one', 'ready', 'retirement', 'other', 'street', 'wise', 'youthful', 'are', 'itching', 'get', 'scum', 'streets', 'pen', 'so', 'when', 'snitch', 'dealer', 'house', 'decide', 'make', 'move', 'search', 'warrant', 'hand', 'guns', 'raised', 'younger', 'cop', 'radios', 'back-up', 'duo', 'up', 'dope', 'dealer', 'however', 'ready', 'door', 'semi-automatic', 'old', 'cop', 'bullets', 'escape', 'killing', 'two', 'policemen', 'silencer', 'stealing', 'unattended', 'police', 'cruiser', 'time', 'dealer', '3', 'districts', 'cops', 'are', 'scene.The', 'district', 'attorney', 'neophyte', 'assistant', 'under-District', 'attorney', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'case', 'get', 'guy', 'DA', 'nothing', 'good', 'publicity', 'son', 'cop', 'who', 'got', 'riddled', 'bullets', 'try', 'case', 'get', 'dealer', 'streets', 'good', 'publicity', 'could', 'mean', 're-election', 'even', 'campaigning', 'mayor', 'seat', 'DA', 'DA', 'great', 'job', 'prosecuting', 'drug', 'dealing', 'Defense', 'Dershowitzian', 'attorney', ""'it"", 'Boy', 'city', 'DA', 'sick', 'Garcia', 'DA', 'position', '.that', 'when', 'stuff', 'hitting', 'fan.I', 'know', 'story', 'plot', 'often', 'been', 'trod', 'entertaining', 'view', 'time', 'anyway', 'DO', 'get', 'feel', 'makers', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'co-stars', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'who', 'too', 'mature', 'play', 'smitten', 'lover', 'role', 'here', 'still', 'babelicious', 'dig', 'initially', 'off', 'someone', 'who', 'gon', 'turn', 'Garcia', 'dad', 'forged', 'Search', 'warrant', 'melts', 'Gandolfini', 'rat', 'partner', 'taking', 'kick', 'backs', 'up', 'shooting', 'head', 'instead', '.their', 'facial', 'expressions', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'what', 'were', 'gon', 'do', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'writing', 'script', 'dialog', 'way', 'anyway', 'can', 'get', 'load', 'Junior', 'Soprano', 'Chianese', 'playing', 'judge', 'things', 'youngish', 'Gandolfini', 'playing', 'street', 'cop']",N/A
