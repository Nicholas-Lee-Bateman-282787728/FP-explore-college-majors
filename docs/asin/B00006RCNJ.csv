This outing is no different.  Sometimes the selections overlap other concerts.  (The one in Vienna particularly has some overlap, but the extra purchase is worth it.)  The reader should note that the song selection was incorrectly given for the product.This set of songs is perhaps the most lively and varied.  There are waltzes, beautiful symphonic songs, ethnic pieces, and jazz numbers.  The timing is great, cutting back and forth from orchestra and audience close-ups back to the maestro, Andre Rieu.  This recording should squash forever the stereotypes that the Brits are stuffy people.  They are invited to waltz in the aisles, while the rest just sway their arms and clap their hands.  The festive atmosphere is accentuated with falling balloons and confetti, dropped to a cheering crowd.  His regard for them is often facetious.  He mimics them as stoney-faced before he cajoles them to dance to Strauss, the way it is meant to be.  He also tells them they will perform Beethoven's Fifth in its entirety, which garners a laugh.  He makes good on his word for a few bars, then segues to ""Brazil Symphony"".  One feels transported by the hyjinx on stage and the occasional aerial and street shots of Big Ben, London Bridge, the double-decker busses, etc.The content is also the most widely eclectic of his DVD's.  They perform intricate ethnic classics like ""Hava Nagila,"" ""Salome' Sobridame,"" and ""Sirtaka Sorbasma"" (sp?).  The mood swings from the lively and playful ""Finiculi Finicula,"" and the British ""Tea for Two,"" to the beautifully mournful ""Nun's Tale"" from 'Cassanova'.  Waltzes are forefront with the unabashed ""The Blue Danube,""  as well as ""The Skater's Waltz"".  There are marches including ""Radesky March"" and ""Stars and Stripes"".  Jazz seems to finish the bill with some jazz-age sounding numbers, including ""Glen Miller Melody,"" ""The 'Andre' Sisters,"" and ""The Second Waltz"".Andre Rieu has reinvented the symphony.  This DVD is an entertaining and engaging reinactment of a festive evening, worthy of owning and reliving again and again.  This is no mere ""Pops"" concert, but a great show with a fine orchestra and an entertaining maestro.",5,Cheers!,1147910400,"05 18, 2006",2006,2252,"['Andre', 'Rieu', 'fine', 'show', 'always', 'warm', 'enthusiastic', 'full', 'good-humor', 'outing', 'different', 'Sometimes', 'selections', 'overlap', 'other', 'concerts', 'one', 'Vienna', 'particularly', 'overlap', 'extra', 'purchase', 'reader', 'should', 'note', 'song', 'selection', 'was', 'incorrectly', 'given', 'product.This', 'set', 'songs', 'perhaps', 'most', 'lively', 'varied', 'are', 'waltzes', 'beautiful', 'symphonic', 'songs', 'ethnic', 'pieces', 'jazz', 'numbers', 'timing', 'great', 'cutting', 'back', 'forth', 'orchestra', 'audience', 'close-ups', 'back', 'maestro', 'Andre', 'Rieu', 'recording', 'should', 'squash', 'forever', 'stereotypes', 'Brits', 'are', 'stuffy', 'people', 'are', 'invited', 'waltz', 'aisles', 'rest', 'just', 'sway', 'arms', 'clap', 'hands', 'festive', 'atmosphere', 'accentuated', 'falling', 'balloons', 'confetti', 'dropped', 'cheering', 'crowd', 'regard', 'often', 'facetious', 'stoney-faced', 'dance', 'Strauss', 'way', 'meant', 'be', 'also', 'will', 'perform', 'Beethoven', 'Fifth', 'entirety', 'laugh', 'good', 'word', 'few', 'bars', 'then', 'Brazil', 'Symphony', 'One', 'feels', 'transported', 'hyjinx', 'stage', 'occasional', 'aerial', 'street', 'shots', 'Big', 'Ben', 'London', 'Bridge', 'double-decker', 'busses', 'etc.The', 'content', 'also', 'most', 'widely', 'eclectic', 'DVD', 'perform', 'intricate', 'ethnic', 'classics', 'Hava', 'Nagila', 'Salome', 'Sobridame', 'Sirtaka', 'Sorbasma', 'sp', 'mood', 'swings', 'lively', 'playful', 'Finiculi', 'Finicula', 'British', 'Tea', 'Two', 'beautifully', 'mournful', 'Nun', 'Tale', ""'Cassanova"", 'Waltzes', 'are', 'forefront', 'unabashed', 'Blue', 'Danube', 'as', 'well', 'Skater', 'Waltz', 'are', 'marches', 'including', 'Radesky', 'March', 'Stars', 'Stripes', 'Jazz', 'finish', 'bill', 'jazz-age', 'sounding', 'numbers', 'including', 'Glen', 'Miller', 'Melody', ""'Andre"", 'Sisters', 'Second', 'Waltz', '.Andre', 'Rieu', 'reinvented', 'symphony', 'DVD', 'entertaining', 'engaging', 'reinactment', 'festive', 'evening', 'worthy', 'owning', 'reliving', 'again', 'again', 'mere', 'Pops', 'concert', 'great', 'show', 'fine', 'orchestra', 'entertaining', 'maestro']",N/A
721766,A1RVT44SHQV8EC,B00006RCNJ,"Able Devildog ""jackjack5""","[34, 46]","I loved the concert, what little of it was on the DVD, which is a short coming of Rieu DVDs. But the video contained a great deal of glare and was hard to watch at times. I have determined that the problem is in the DVD. I noticed when viewing other Rieu DVDs that show samples from the Albert Hall concert that the color quality is poor.One of the characteristics that I have liked about Rieu's concerts is that there is a wide selection of music so that each DVD presents different music. Not so in this DVD. Many of the selections are repeats of the music from &quot;Dreaming.&quot; The interesting thing is when the same pieces were played in &quot;Dreaming&quot; they were dull and poorly played. Yet in this video they are lively and well played and interesting. I must say that there were two pieces on this DVD that I found uninteresting and thank gosh I could just fast forward over them.Again the problem with Rieu DVDs is that only half the concerts are included. Maybe that is because the rest of the concert was boring and for that reason was not included. But I enjoyed most of what was included.",2,"Concert is great, the DVD video is of poor quality",1063929600,"09 19, 2003",2003,1110,"['loved', 'concert', 'what', 'was', 'DVD', 'short', 'coming', 'Rieu', 'DVDs', 'video', 'contained', 'great', 'deal', 'glare', 'was', 'hard', 'watch', 'times', 'have', 'determined', 'problem', 'DVD', 'noticed', 'when', 'viewing', 'other', 'Rieu', 'DVDs', 'show', 'samples', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'concert', 'color', 'quality', 'poor.One', 'characteristics', 'have', 'liked', 'Rieu', 'concerts', 'wide', 'selection', 'music', 'DVD', 'presents', 'different', 'music', 'Not', 'so', 'DVD', 'Many', 'selections', 'are', 'repeats', 'music', 'quot', 'Dreaming.', 'quot', 'interesting', 'thing', 'when', 'same', 'pieces', 'were', 'played', 'quot', 'Dreaming', 'quot', 'were', 'dull', 'poorly', 'played', 'video', 'are', 'lively', 'well', 'played', 'interesting', 'must', 'say', 'were', 'two', 'pieces', 'DVD', 'found', 'uninteresting', 'thank', 'gosh', 'could', 'just', 'fast', 'forward', 'them.Again', 'problem', 'Rieu', 'DVDs', 'only', 'concerts', 'are', 'included', 'Maybe', 'rest', 'concert', 'was', 'boring', 'reason', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'what', 'was', 'included']",N/A

Anyone who has seen an Andre Rieu performace either live (as we did in Denver last week) or on DVD knows that Rieu really knows how to whip up a quiet croud into a musical frenzy.All heck begins to break lose about 2/3 into the concert when balloons are released into the huge audience at the Royal Albert Hall. Then begins a series of encores starting with a Glenn Miller and Andrews Sisters medley - you have to see this - must be at least 10,000 people jumping, singing, dancing with joy - and then unbelievably things just begin to fire up. At the end of the concert the orchestra plays a rousing Stars and Stripes (keep in mind this is after 9/11) and then a bag pipe band joins in Auld Lang Syne. I'd buy this disc just for this.Thank you Andre Rieu and orchestra members for bringing this music to us. Those of you who are leary, hesitate no longer - buy and enjoy. The Dublin performance is also excellent but the 2 are different enough to get both.
