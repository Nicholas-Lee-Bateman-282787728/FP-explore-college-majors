573934,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B000059PPA,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[0, 0]","This film was made in 1989. It was compared to Woody Allen's work at the time because it was quirky, funny, profound and filled with zingy one liners throughout. It was made by Hal Hartley who would continue to be compared to Allen if Allen weren't Jewish and his films could at times have happy endings. In 2014 you will have to search high and low to find a love story this good being made present day.23 year old beauty Adrienne Shelly was Hartley's muse. She played a just graduated from high school girl en route to Harvard. Her love interest is a rumored murderer now working as a mechanic for her father. In typical quirky Hartley fashion no one seems to know who he murdered or why and his list of victims is entirely based on local gossip.The relationship between the girl and her father is absolutely hilarious as well. They are at cross purposes throughout. When he tries to put a spoke in her wheels, she turns around and becomes an overnight success as a lingerie model, splashed all across the New York papers, which sends him into a tizzy. She is also convinced that the world is on the brink of a nuclear disaster and this hilariously peppers all her exchanges as well.If you have never seen this film, you need to change that now!",5,Love Story That Was Smash Hit at Sundance,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,1247,"['film', 'was', 'made', '1989', 'was', 'compared', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'work', 'time', 'was', 'quirky', 'funny', 'profound', 'filled', 'zingy', 'one', 'was', 'made', 'Hal', 'Hartley', 'who', 'would', 'continue', 'be', 'compared', 'Allen', 'Allen', 'were', ""n't"", 'Jewish', 'films', 'could', 'times', 'have', 'happy', 'endings', '2014', 'will', 'have', 'search', 'high', 'low', 'find', 'love', 'story', 'good', 'being', 'made', 'present', 'day.23', 'year', 'old', 'beauty', 'Adrienne', 'Shelly', 'was', 'Hartley', 'muse', 'played', 'just', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'route', 'Harvard', 'love', 'interest', 'rumored', 'murderer', 'now', 'working', 'mechanic', 'father', 'typical', 'quirky', 'Hartley', 'fashion', 'one', 'know', 'who', 'murdered', 'why', 'list', 'victims', 'entirely', 'based', 'local', 'gossip.The', 'relationship', 'girl', 'father', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'well', 'are', 'cross', 'purposes', 'When', 'put', 'spoke', 'wheels', 'around', 'overnight', 'success', 'lingerie', 'model', 'splashed', 'New', 'York', 'papers', 'tizzy', 'also', 'convinced', 'world', 'brink', 'nuclear', 'disaster', 'hilariously', 'peppers', 'exchanges', 'well.If', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'need', 'change', 'now']",The Unbelievable Truth
573935,A1VJ7HYM1EC94M,B000059PPA,"G P Padillo ""paolo""","[12, 16]","Fraught with over obvious symbolism, Hartley's early feature is nonetheless a joy to watch. Hal here shows us his uncanny ability to cast his characters perfectly came early in his career.Adrienne Shelley is a near perfect foil to herself, equal parts annoying teen burgeoning in her sexuality (though using sex for several years); obsessed with doom and inspired by idealism gone wrong she is deceptively - and simultaneously - complex and simple.  Her Audrey inspires so many levels of symbolism it is almost embarrassingly rich (e.g., her modeling career beginning with photos of her foot - culminating her doing nude (but unseen) work; Manhattan move; Europe trip; her stealing, then sleeping with the mechanics wrench, etc.)As Josh, Robert Burke gives an absolutely masterful performance.  A reformed prisoner/penitent he returns to his home town to face down past demons, accept his lot and begin a new life.  Dressed in black, and repeatedly mistaken for a priest, he corrects everyone (""I'm a mechanic""), yet the symbolism is rich:  he abstains from alcohol, he practices celibacy (is, in fact a virgin), and seemingly has taken on vows of poverty, and humility as well.  The humility seems hardest to swallow seeming, at times, almost false, a pretense.  Yet, as we learn more of Josh we see genuineness in his modesty, that his humility is indeed earnest and believable.  What seems ironic is the character is fairly forthright in his simplicity, yet so richly drawn it becomes the viewer who wants to make him out as more than what he actually is.  A fascinatingly written character, perfectly played.The scene between Josh and Jane (a wonderful, young Edie Falco  . . . ""You need a woman not a girl"") is hilarious . . . real.  But Hartley can't leave it as such and his trick, having the actors repeat the dialogue over-and-over becomes frustratingly ""arty"" and annoying . . . until again it becomes hilarious.  What a terrific sense of bizarre reality this lends the film (like kids in a perpetual ""am not""/""are too"" argument).Hartley's weaves all of a small neighborhood's idiosyncrasies into a tapestry of seeming stereotypes but which delves far beneath the surface, the catalyst being that everyone believes they know what the ""unbelievable truth"" of the title is, yet no two people can agree (including our hero) on what exactly that truth is.  A wonderful little movie with some big ideas.",3,Unbelievable Fun,1073260800,"01 5, 2004",2004,2408,"['Fraught', 'obvious', 'symbolism', 'Hartley', 'early', 'feature', 'nonetheless', 'joy', 'watch', 'Hal', 'here', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'cast', 'characters', 'perfectly', 'came', 'early', 'career.Adrienne', 'Shelley', 'near', 'perfect', 'foil', 'herself', 'equal', 'parts', 'annoying', 'teen', 'burgeoning', 'sexuality', 'using', 'sex', 'several', 'years', 'obsessed', 'doom', 'inspired', 'idealism', 'gone', 'wrong', 'deceptively', 'simultaneously', 'complex', 'simple', 'Audrey', 'inspires', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'symbolism', 'almost', 'embarrassingly', 'rich', 'e.g.', 'modeling', 'career', 'beginning', 'photos', 'foot', 'culminating', 'doing', 'nude', 'unseen', 'work', 'Manhattan', 'move', 'Europe', 'trip', 'stealing', 'then', 'sleeping', 'mechanics', 'wrench', 'etc', 'Josh', 'Robert', 'Burke', 'absolutely', 'masterful', 'performance', 'reformed', 'prisoner/penitent', 'home', 'town', 'face', 'down', 'past', 'demons', 'accept', 'lot', 'begin', 'new', 'life', 'Dressed', 'black', 'repeatedly', 'mistaken', 'priest', 'everyone', ""'m"", 'mechanic', 'yet', 'symbolism', 'rich', 'alcohol', 'practices', 'celibacy', 'fact', 'virgin', 'seemingly', 'taken', 'vows', 'poverty', 'humility', 'as', 'well', 'humility', 'hardest', 'swallow', 'seeming', 'times', 'almost', 'false', 'pretense', 'Yet', 'learn', 'more', 'Josh', 'see', 'genuineness', 'modesty', 'humility', 'indeed', 'earnest', 'believable', 'What', 'ironic', 'character', 'fairly', 'forthright', 'simplicity', 'yet', 'so', 'richly', 'drawn', 'viewer', 'who', 'make', 'out', 'more', 'what', 'actually', 'fascinatingly', 'written', 'character', 'perfectly', 'played.The', 'scene', 'Josh', 'Jane', 'wonderful', 'young', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'need', 'woman', 'not', 'girl', 'hilarious', 'real', 'Hartley', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'such', 'trick', 'having', 'actors', 'repeat', 'dialogue', 'over-and-over', 'becomes', 'frustratingly', 'arty', 'annoying', 'again', 'hilarious', 'What', 'terrific', 'sense', 'bizarre', 'reality', 'film', 'kids', 'perpetual', 'am', 'not', '/', 'are', 'too', 'argument', '.Hartley', 'weaves', 'small', 'neighborhood', 'idiosyncrasies', 'tapestry', 'seeming', 'stereotypes', 'far', 'surface', 'catalyst', 'being', 'everyone', 'know', 'what', 'unbelievable', 'truth', 'title', 'yet', 'two', 'people', 'can', 'agree', 'including', 'hero', 'what', 'exactly', 'truth', 'wonderful', 'little', 'movie', 'big', 'ideas']",The Unbelievable Truth

Firmly entrenched in the 80s when it was made, this lightweight comic romance has a lead character of the wonderful Adrienne Shelley (RIP) as a young woman who negotiates college versus work deals with her parents while believing the world is going to end via nuclear disaster at any moment. Into this comes the hero, Robert Burke in his gorgeous youth, as a newly released prisoner coming back to his hometown. The script is brainy banter and just walks the fine line between stage and actual people, which is one of Hartley's best talents.

573939,A2MUH4HYG43RD4,B000059PPA,"OgreVI ""OgreVI""","[1, 2]","This one is less underrated than just plain unknown. It was the first film for both Hal Hartley and Adrienne Shelly (described by the Onion's A/V Club as ""the thinking person's obscure object of desire""). Hartley went on to become one of the best independent filmmakers in America (Henry Fool,No Such Thing,Trust) and Shelly to become an indie-film queen both as an actress and later as writer and director (Waitress,I'll Take You There,Sudden Manhattan). As with all of Hartley's work it is quirky, funny, talky, and thoughtful; as always, Shelly is charming and perfect. The story is small and in places bizarre, but the characters are beautifully drawn: Josh, a mechanic who is more like a Shaolin monk, is released from prison and returns to his hometown.  No one there can seem to remember exactly what he did to get sent to prison in the first place, but it just MUST have been pretty bad.  Audry, a cynical high school senior wrestling with the meaninglessness of life, falls for him.  And, yeah, it's just that simple; it's less about story than about the interactions between the characters.  It's funny, but smart-funny, not goofball-funny. Well, okay, it's a little bit goofball-funny too, I suppose. This is a small, rough, sparkling diamond of a movie.
