After this, though, I'm tempted to track it down.Jack (Kevin Smith regular Jason Mewes, who plays Jay in the Jay and Silent Bob movies), a lovelorn EMT, and his partner Roger (The Boondock Saints' Richard Fitzpatrick), are going about their daily lives on the graveyard shift. Jack is moaning about his ex-girlfriend Sherry (The Mad's Jordan Madley) and Roger is telling him it's time to get on with his life (in not so polite terms). So what do you think happens when Jack, on his way home from work, discovers a dying woman in an alley? EMT training and rebound attachment combine. It doesn't help matters that the woman, whose name is Danika (Erica Cox from American Pie Presents Beta House), is smokin' hot. Jack falls almost instantly, and Danika isn't averse, but there's one big problem: Danika, as it turns out, was attacked by a vampire. What do you do when you're an EMT and your new girlfriend has a taste for the red stuff?I have to say that my favorite thing about this movie is actually the interplay between Jack and Roger; it's what would have happened had Quentin Tarantino written the dialogue for Scorsese's Bringing Out the Dead: sharp, funny, and natural-sounding. Once the plot is kicked off, the dialogue is a bit less...well, that. But I really liked the pacing here, the acting is stellar for a movie of this caliber, the script is awesome, and Glazer is a competent director.

Once you take all the f**k and b**ch words out of his repertoire, Mewes as an actor is pretty much worthless and ineffective.  The supporting character, Roger, is also interesting at the onset, but one too many crapper jokes send him flushing down that proverbial porcelain throne not too far later.  As for the horror-comedy itself, it neither works as a comedy by trying to use a relationship with a vampire as a spoof for rebounding, co-dependence and/or the junkie-life, nor does it work as horror since there isn't one scary moment in the whole film save for possibly when we first see Daneka left for dead in a dumpster.  Setting the majority of the movie in Jack's apartment makes for both a claustrophobic and boring movie.  She knows she is a vampire, she knows she has the power to leave and find her own food in a city full of low-lifes, so why doesn't she.  Sure, dear reader, you will have your own take on this.
