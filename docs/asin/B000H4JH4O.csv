1009178,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000H4JH4O,A Customer,"[3, 7]","Charming and somewhat funny Keeping up with the Steins features some appealing performances from its cast, but I couldn't help feeling that the movie reads more like a pilot episode for a late-night cable television series. Despite its propensity for cheapness, the movie mostly succeeds because it blends humor and heart into a satisfying if somewhat predictable experience.Keeping up with the Steins centers on Brentwood Hollywood agent Adam Fiedler (Jeremy Piven), whose son Benjamin (Daryl Sabara) is about to celebrate his bar mitzvah. Their best friends the Steins recently celebrated their own son's bar mitzvah on an ocean liner at sea. This tacky excess, however, proves a bit much for the uptight Adam and his adoring wife Joanne (Jami Gertz).Rather than deal with the party planning the poor Ben just wants to be left alone and he certainly isn't sure that his dad's plan for a Dodger Stadium extravaganza is the best way to go. The big day is also threatened by the arrival of Adam's long-lost estranged father (Garry Marshall) who is now an aging hippie who abandoned his mother (Doris Roberts) twenty-six years earlier.When he pulls up in front of the Fiedler's Brentwood home in a beat-up trailer, accompanied by his free-spirited vegan girlfriend Sacred Feather (Daryl Hannah), the poor Adam is appalled that his father has the gaul to return after all these years.  The inevitable tensions flare, but the show does go on, albeit in a considerably scaled down, more organic and sublte version of the big celebration.Although first time director Scott Marshall attempts to lampoon West Los Angeles materialism and excess, Keeping Up with the Steins is actually more of a fun-filled and irreverent homage to Jewish family life. Marshall also has a flair for subtly  - none of the characters are ever over-exaggerated or portrayed as stereotypes and his jokes sort of creep up on you, without ever being thrown in your face.There are a few slow spots but the likable and engaging cast mostly save the day. Besides the elder Marshall and Piven, Doris Roberts is on hand as wise Grandma, Cheryl Hines as a perky party planner, and Richard Benjamin as the rabbi who plugs his TV appearances.

Rossi,"[4, 4]","As a fan of the spy kids movies because of Daryl Sabara's dead on performance as a fun loving boy who just happened to also be a spy, I felt I owed it to Daryl to see Keeping up With the Steins. This movie went so far beyond my expectations it was unbelievable. It oozed of indie doings rather than the ridiculously adolescent Hollywood humor and is by far the best coming of age comedy drama since Saint Ralph. Daryl is perfect as a boy on the road to confusing times of bar mitzvahs and expected manhood at 13 when he hasn't even reached his own self imposed milestone of being 5 feet tall by the time of the opening phrase of the bar mitzvah ceremony is uttered by the rabbi. He finds that maturity has a whole lot more to do with accepting life's unimportant and insignificant limitations than trying to rebel against them. He also learns that the most important thing is family and not trying to artificially be any better than what you really are. The rest of the cast is exceptional, in particular Jeremy Piven as the 'best bar mitzvah at any cost' dad, Garry marshall as the wisecracking hippie grandpa and Larry Miller as the 'Stein' to keep up with. The laughs are unstoppable and the story is a wonder to watch unfold.My only wish is that there were more for Doris Roberts to do in the movie.

1009187,A1OBJ2263JCK5,B000H4JH4O,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[0, 0]","""Keeping Up With the Steins"" is an amiable and very funny film comedy, which will bring back memories for anyone, who has gone through the Bar Mitzvah experience. For anyone who dosn't know, this is a Jewish coming-of-age ceremony in which a 13 year old, Jewish male, publicly reads from the Torah and is initiated into the religious community as an adult.It is traditional, that a ""feast"" or party usually follows in celebration of this accomplishment.The movie is a very funny look at a dysfunctional Jewish family and one Bar Mitzvah boy's search for the true meaning of the ceremony, that he's about to partake in. In the film teenager, Ben Fiedler (Daryl Sabara) and his family attend the ridiculously ostentatious, ""Titanic"" movie themed, Bar Mitzvah party  (""I'm king of the Haftorah!!"") put on by the Steins. In a fit of envy Ben's father, Adam Fiedler (Jeremy Piven) a wealthy, Hollywood agent, starts making plans to rent out Dodger Stadium and hiring Neil Diamond to sing. All this attention, planning and fuss seems to make young Ben squirm with embarassment. He dosn't seem to really understand any of this. In hopes of stopping (or at least slowing down) his father's crazy plans, Ben secretely invites his Grandfather Irving (Garry Marshall), who has for years been estranged from the family. Irving, an eccentric character, shows up on the family doorstep (with a hippie girlfriend in tow) and starts to work his way into the family's life. More importantly he forms a bond with Ben and starts to nudge the young man into the direction of becoming his own man and finding out the true meaning of becoming Bar Mitzvah.Director, Scott Marshall has created a really hilarious and sweet movie. This film could have very easily degenerated into nothing but stereotypes and gross caricatures. Instead Mark Zakirin's script presents a very funny, but touching look at a family, that has its problems. The parents really do care about their kid. The kid really is trying to understand, what all the fuss is about. This is a step above the usual dreck, when Hollywood tries to make film comedies about families.The cast to this film is all around great. Daryl Sabara does an good job of protraying the befuddled feelings of a normal thirteen year old. Likewise, Jeremy Piven is over the top and great as the Hollywood agent/father. This isn't much of a stretch for him, since he's basically playing a sweetened version of his hilarious agent character, Ari Gold (found on the HBO series ""Entourage""). Gary Marshall as the grandfather is basically doing the same shtick (yelling, screaming, sarcasm) he does in all his acting roles. Normally I'm not a big fan of his, but in this case, the character and his mannerisms actually work well. Finally kudos should go to Jamie Gertz as the understanding mom, Doris Roberts (of ""Everyone Loves Raymond"" fame) as the grandma and Daryl Hannah in an interesting turn as Grandpa Irving's hippie girlfriend. A wonderful cast and an smart, funny script make this an excellent movie!

1009189,A1TPAG6HM8EN8L,B000H4JH4O,"Melanie N. Lee ""mnl_1221""","[24, 25]","""Keeping Up with the Steins"": As a Gentile, I'm not privy to things such as Passover celebrations at home or Bar or Bat Mitzvahs.  One of the beauties of the movies is giving viewers a peek at worlds and times they may not otherwise see.  Keeping Up with the Steins is a funny, touching, sweet movie about a preteen boy, his competitive father, and estranged grandfather.Benjamin Fiedler (Daryl Sabara) and his parents Adam and Joanne (Jeremy Piven, Jami Gertz), who live in Brentwood, CA, attend an over-the-top Titanic-themed Bar Mitzvah given by Arnie Stein (Larry Miller) for his son.  Adam, a Hollywood agent, determined to ""blow away the Steins"", hires an event planner to plan a blockbuster event held at Dodger Stadium.  Benjamin, overwhelmed and confused over what a Bar Mitzvah means anyway, decides to deflate his father's bluster by secretly inviting Adam's father Irwin (Garry Marshall), who left Adam's mother Rose (Doris Roberts) decades ago.  Irwin arrives in his RV with his free-spirited girlfriend Sacred Feather (Darryl Hannah), two weeks early according to Benjamin's doctored invitation.  Adam complains, ""My driveway has become a trailer park!""This film boasts of a good roster of supporting character actors, including Marshall, Roberts, Miller, and Richard Benjamin as the rabbi.  The man portraying the Bar/Bat Mitzvah teacher was as cute as all out.  Although this movie surely wasn't intended as a primer for Bar Mitvahs, the film shows scenes of the class, as well as Irwin's attempts to deepen Benjamin's understanding of the ceremony.  I wish the film had explored the religious and spiritual questions even further, but this isn't The Chosen.I don't think this film overindulges in Jewish stereotypes, though that's not for me to say.  You do get more than one glimpse of Marshall's bare toukus while he's swimming, and you also get some thoughts about materialism, family responsibility, and spirituality, as Benjamin starts to discover and assert his budding adulthood.

1009191,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000H4JH4O,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[11, 12]","Are there people who actually spend hundreds of thousands on Bar Mitzvahs?  In the Brentwood community of ""Keeping Up with The Steins"", the answer is ""ofcourse"", and the movie kicks off with with a Bar Mitzvah set on a cruise ship and based on ""Titanic"" (the event and the movie - ""I'm the King of the Torah!!"" exults the Bar Mitzvah boy).  The Stein's aren't the heroes of this story - rather they are never-present foils of the Fiedlers.  Denizens of Brentwood, where everybody seems to work for celebrities and earns more money than anybody knows what to do with, the Fiedlers face their son's approaching Bar Mitzvah with a mixture of anticipation and dread - how are they going to outdo the Steins?  Adam, Benji Fiedler's father (Jeremy Piven, playing a patriarchal version of the character he plays on ""Entourage"") needs little prodding before Dodger Stadium becomes the Bar Mitzvah's chosen venue.  Once a partner with Stein and now a bitter competitor, Adam is determined to leave nothing to chance.  The ""nothing"", we later learn, is his own horrid past - his father (Garry Marshall) was a jovial guy too full of life to stick around and actually be a family man.  Years after abandoning his family, Adam's father lives out in the desert with his younger and hyper-new-agey wife ""Sacred Feather"" (Darryl Hannah).  Frantic preparations for his Bar Mitzvah inform Benjamin Fiedler's dread -he can't ""chant"" his Haftorah to save his life (and if you don't know what a Haftorah is, don't worry - the point of the story is that Benjamin knows about as much), he moons over the beautiful Ashley, hopes his father will patch things up with his grandfather, and hopes that maybe he can become a man without the need to outdo the fearsome Stein's.""Steins"" is a small if innocuous gem - a small movie with a lot of familiar faces.  It looks like that kind of movie that people make to unwind while making bigger and more trying movies, and the cast looks like they had about as much fun making the movie as I did watching it.  There are small but nuanced performances, and the cast gets through the plots small but myriad challenges.  The story never congeals - the hated Steins are almost non-entities in a movie that bares their name.  But the script won't require much effort to keep up with its in-Jewish jokes (like the difference between ""Nachos"" & ""Nachas"").  The basic point of the story (that some of these celebrations are so overdone that those involved lose sight of what they're celebrating) isn't too heavily delivered, and if there aren't any real jokes, the understated performances are guaranteed to keep a smile on your face - like Benji's grandmother, the story gets its point across without having to openly speak its mind.  If you need a rest from exploding cars and devilish fashion editors, drop by The Steins.",4,Easygoing Jewish comedy anybody can relate to.,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,2832,"['Are', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'spend', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'Bar', 'Mitzvahs', 'Brentwood', 'community', 'Keeping', 'Up', 'Steins', 'answer', 'ofcourse', 'movie', 'off', 'Bar', 'Mitzvah', 'set', 'cruise', 'ship', 'based', 'Titanic', 'event', 'movie', ""'m"", 'King', 'Torah', 'Bar', 'Mitzvah', 'boy', 'Stein', 'are', ""n't"", 'heroes', 'story', 'rather', 'are', 'never-present', 'foils', 'Fiedlers', 'Denizens', 'Brentwood', 'where', 'everybody', 'work', 'celebrities', 'more', 'money', 'anybody', 'what', 'do', 'Fiedlers', 'face', 'son', 'approaching', 'Bar', 'Mitzvah', 'mixture', 'anticipation', 'dread', 'how', 'are', 'going', 'outdo', 'Steins', 'Adam', 'Benji', 'Fiedler', 'father', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'playing', 'patriarchal', 'version', 'character', 'Entourage', 'little', 'prodding', 'Dodger', 'Stadium', 'Bar', 'Mitzvah', 'chosen', 'venue', 'Once', 'partner', 'Stein', 'now', 'bitter', 'competitor', 'Adam', 'determined', 'leave', 'nothing', 'chance', 'nothing', 'later', 'learn', 'own', 'horrid', 'father', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'was', 'jovial', 'guy', 'too', 'full', 'life', 'stick', 'around', 'actually', 'be', 'family', 'man', 'Years', 'abandoning', 'family', 'Adam', 'father', 'out', 'desert', 'younger', 'hyper-new-agey', 'wife', 'Sacred', 'Feather', 'Darryl', 'Hannah', 'Frantic', 'preparations', 'Bar', 'Mitzvah', 'inform', 'Benjamin', 'Fiedler', 'dread', '-he', 'ca', ""n't"", 'chant', 'Haftorah', 'save', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Haftorah', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'point', 'story', 'Benjamin', 'as', 'much', 'beautiful', 'Ashley', 'father', 'will', 'patch', 'things', 'up', 'grandfather', 'maybe', 'can', 'become', 'man', 'need', 'outdo', 'fearsome', 'Stein', 'Steins', 'small', 'innocuous', 'gem', 'small', 'movie', 'lot', 'familiar', 'kind', 'movie', 'people', 'make', 'unwind', 'making', 'bigger', 'more', 'trying', 'movies', 'cast', 'had', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'making', 'movie', 'did', 'watching', 'are', 'small', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'cast', 'plots', 'small', 'myriad', 'challenges', 'story', 'never', 'hated', 'Steins', 'are', 'almost', 'non-entities', 'movie', 'name', 'script', 'wo', ""n't"", 'require', 'much', 'effort', 'keep', 'up', 'in-Jewish', 'jokes', 'difference', 'Nachos', 'Nachas', 'basic', 'point', 'story', 'celebrations', 'are', 'so', 'overdone', 'involved', 'lose', 'sight', 'what', ""'re"", 'celebrating', ""n't"", 'too', 'heavily', 'delivered', 'are', ""n't"", 'real', 'jokes', 'understated', 'performances', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'keep', 'smile', 'face', 'Benji', 'grandmother', 'story', 'point', 'having', 'openly', 'speak', 'mind', 'need', 'rest', 'exploding', 'cars', 'devilish', 'fashion', 'editors', 'drop', 'Steins']",Keeping Up With the Steins

In many ways it is like an inside joke as it protrays the Jewish Culture but the story and messages are really broader than that.  It borders on satire as it shows Beverly Hills/Brentwood in Calif with all of the joggers, pretension, and trivial value system that is so prevalent there, but beneath this veneer is a heart warming and rather realistic story of a family.  It vividly demonstrates that money can buy anything but something of value and the most valuable thing is family.  He shows that marriages are complex things and only those two in the marriage really understand it and those on the outside shouldn't make judgements regarding someone else's marriage.  This was a story of regrets, mistakes, and foregiveness and shows it is never too late to say ""I'm sorry"".  The interplay between the grandparents was marvelous and could have added a great deal more to the movie had it been expanded.  The son's inability to forgive was very believable and even his grudging acceptance at the end was believable. This was a marvelous movie that delivered several very good messages with a light and humorous touch.  Very well done and if you are looking for a good family movie this is one.
