Director Michael Winterbottom is more into being seen as an ""auteur"" than in creating a cohesive film. He thinks he is being naturalistic by not using any lighting, but the eye naturally captures more light than a camera lens does so several scenes are so dark it is difficult to tell who is talking in situations where this would not be true in real life. Don't expect the central mystery of the film to be resolved, that is apparently too low-brow for Mr. Winterbottom. To be fair, if you liked ""And When Was the Last Time You Saw Your Father,"" then you'll probably be moved by this one, too,  But from my POV, it doesn't deliver both artistry & story like some of Mr, Firth's other films -- A Month in the Country, Apartment Zero, Trauma, The King's Speech, etc. -- it is more just art for its own sake.",2,Disappointed,1302825600,"04 15, 2011",2011,934,"['long-time', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'fan', 'looked', 'forward', 'film', 'performance', 'dead', 'film', 'was', 'disappointing', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Winterbottom', 'more', 'being', 'seen', 'auteur', 'creating', 'cohesive', 'film', 'being', 'naturalistic', 'not', 'using', 'lighting', 'eye', 'naturally', 'more', 'light', 'camera', 'lens', 'so', 'several', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'dark', 'difficult', 'tell', 'who', 'talking', 'situations', 'where', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'real', 'life', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'central', 'mystery', 'film', 'be', 'resolved', 'apparently', 'too', 'low-brow', 'Mr.', 'Winterbottom', 'be', 'fair', 'liked', 'When', 'Was', 'Last', 'Time', 'Saw', 'Father', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'moved', 'one', 'too', 'POV', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'artistry', 'story', 'Mr', 'Firth', 'other', 'films', 'Month', 'Country', 'Apartment', 'Zero', 'Trauma', 'King', 'Speech', 'etc', 'more', 'just', 'art', 'own', 'sake']",A Summer in Genoa

1412173,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B004KDYQXU,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","I've been recently on somewhat of a Catherine Keener Kick, so I just had to watch ""Summer in Genoa.""But there are surely other nice actors in this film as well:  Colin Firth, who nicely plays a widowed father of two girls; Willa Holland, who is more than just a pretty face; and Perla Haney-Jardine, who probably steals the show with an excellent performance, particularly for her age.  But Genoa is surely a character here as well.So often, you see these films where Americans jet off to Europe to discover themselves.  They can let it all hang out there; after all, the same-old-lame-old restrictions just don't apply in the more liberal Old World!  Well, and it gives the actors an excuse to accept a role as they get to be on vacation while filming.  Yeah!  Everybody wins!But surely not here.  The pace is both slower and faster in Europe - it depends upon what you are doing - and it doesn't feel like an excuse to film in Christopher Columbus' birthplace this time.  I really liked the cinematography here - or there more like it - and it is one Italian city that I haven't been to but would love to go.  Especially now.During the film, the viewer is led to believe that Mr. Firth, who has gone through tragedy, will endure only more tragedy, and soon.  There is danger everywhere, and you're just waiting for the next shoe to fall in the country that is shaped like a boot.  But will he avoid getting kicked in the groin again?Well, you'll have to view for yourself to find out.  A recommendation by me, on this film that shows how people can move past their tragedy, pain and guilt.

1412176,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004KDYQXU,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","A SUMMER IN GENOA is one of those films that leaves its impression on the viewer after the film is over.  As far as a movie goes, not much happens -to the eye - but a lot of introspection and searching for meaning where there doesn't seem to be much makes the film worth watching.Academician Joe (Colin Firth) and his daughters Kelly (Willa Holland) and Mary (Perla Haney-Jardine) have moved to Italy in an attempt to resolve the pain and resentment of the accidental death of Marianne (Hope Lange), their wife/mother.  Once settled in Genoa, Joe takes on a teaching job and meets an old college friend Barbara (Catherine Keener), Kelly feels her hormones raging and dashes about the old city with boys, while May concentrates on piano lessons and is disturbed by visions of her departed mother. Each finds escape in special fashions but in the end the introspection that occurs during that special summer alters the way the three remaining family members interact.The actors do well with their parts, especially Colin Firth, and the film serves more as a lesson in grieving and how families can decide to be divided by loss of a loved one  or find a closer bond.  The end effect is a beautifully photographed, understated, quiet film that leaves room for food for thought afterward.

1412179,A2GPEV42IO41CI,B004KDYQXU,Kona,"[8, 9]","After his wife dies, Joe (Colin Firth) decides a change of scenery would be good for him and his two daughters, so he accepts a teaching job at the university in Genoa.  The younger daughter is racked with guilt and sees visions of her mother, the teenage daughter rebels by chasing boys, while dad enjoys his job and his students.With a cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; style and plot, this film feels like a reality show.  Dialogue is mumbled and often insignificant, emotions are muted and interactions are casual, the handheld camera is often shaky, and it all seems too ordinary to be interesting for an hour and a half.  The children are often lost among the dark and winding alleyways of the city, building tension that, unfortunately, never pays off.  The script (which annoyingly sometimes said they were there for a year, other times just there for the summer) goes on and on about their daily activities in  a new city and that's realistic, but not, for me, necessarily entertaining.Firth is very good as the father, but we never get to know or understand him well.  Only once does he mention his wife and his feelings about her aren't clear.  He seems to get over her quickly enough, embracing the city and romancing a local.  Willa Holland is convincing as a self-centered and headstrong teen and is thoroughly unlikable.  The youngest daughter is more sympathetic, but there was something lacking that kept me from caring about her.All in all, I enjoyed the scenery but the story lacked emotion and clarity and was dull for me.",2,Forgettable,1308096000,"06 15, 2011",2011,1543,"['wife', 'dies', 'Joe', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'change', 'scenery', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'two', 'daughters', 'teaching', 'job', 'university', 'Genoa', 'younger', 'daughter', 'racked', 'guilt', 'sees', 'visions', 'mother', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'rebels', 'chasing', 'boys', 'dad', 'job', 'students.With', 'cin', 'eacute', 'v', 'eacute', 'rit', 'eacute', 'style', 'plot', 'film', 'feels', 'reality', 'show', 'Dialogue', 'mumbled', 'often', 'insignificant', 'emotions', 'are', 'muted', 'interactions', 'are', 'casual', 'handheld', 'camera', 'often', 'shaky', 'too', 'ordinary', 'be', 'interesting', 'hour', 'half', 'children', 'are', 'often', 'lost', 'dark', 'winding', 'alleyways', 'city', 'building', 'tension', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'script', 'annoyingly', 'sometimes', 'said', 'were', 'there', 'year', 'other', 'times', 'just', 'summer', 'daily', 'activities', 'new', 'city', 'realistic', 'not', 'necessarily', 'entertaining.Firth', 'very', 'good', 'father', 'never', 'get', 'know', 'understand', 'well', 'Only', 'once', 'mention', 'wife', 'feelings', 'are', ""n't"", 'clear', 'get', 'quickly', 'enough', 'embracing', 'city', 'romancing', 'local', 'Willa', 'Holland', 'convincing', 'self-centered', 'headstrong', 'teen', 'thoroughly', 'unlikable', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'was', 'something', 'lacking', 'kept', 'caring', 'her.All', 'enjoyed', 'scenery', 'story', 'lacked', 'emotion', 'clarity', 'was', 'dull']",A Summer in Genoa

The movie deals with their relationships and how each family member deals with the loss.What bothered me most was the apparent lack of parental control. The two daughters seem to act without regard for others or consequences. For example, would a bright, pre-adolescent child really be reckless enough to cover both her mother's eyes while driving on an icy road? Why was the father's response so ""subdued"" when his teenage daughter disregards his curfew on going out with unknown Italian boys shortly after arriving in Genoa? Instead, he allows her to treat him disrespectfully and party every night and day, even when she fails to be there for her younger sister. Also, younger daughter, Mary, seems to think she can take off at any time without any consequence to follow her dead mother's ghost, e.g. leaving the church and worrying the entire family for hours; later she causes a traffic accident by running across a busy street - again without regard for others.  These actions may be examples of the girls acting out but then what lies underneath needs to be dealt with, not ignored or patted with ""There, there.  It's OK."" The budding romantic relationship between the father and one of his students seems out of place. Yes, the director may want to show the father getting on with his life but where does this romance lead? In the film - no where.These issues are difficult to address but instead of delving into them, the director merely skims the surface - creating a sketch rather than a painting.  Most of the cinematography was done with hand-held camera and creates greater intimacy.

His two daughters were in the car when it happens and the youngest one actually caused the accident.  As the family wrestles with this Colin Firth feels he needs a change for himself and his two daughters and so he accepts a job in Genoa.  He meets up with his old friend who becomes their constant companion, played by Catherine Keener.  She is a wonderful character in the movie.This is one of those wonderful movies with a good, sweet, touching story, yet shows so many delightful things about living in Italy, both good and bad.  You see gorgeous landscapes and churches, while at the same time I love how Colin Firth's daughter at one point holds her nose and complains about how an area they pass smells like urine.  I like that because I remember being in Paris and while being dazzled by the city on one hand I remember smelling urine as I walked down a side street.  This movie really shows the charm and the more real side of European life while telling a very pithy story about life.It also shows how all of them wrestle with their own issues, from the youngest ones perspective, still imagining her mom, to his teenage daughter who wants boys and partying, to Colin Firth as an adult.  Very cute scenes with Firth and his daughters at times.

Kathleen Keener, one of those actresses that gives any film a feeling of reality is superb in this film. That said, this could be one of the more symbolic films I have seen. It is an OK film, but not a great one. Heavy on drama and darkness and grief.A family has lost their mother in a car accident. The youngest daughter thinks she is to blame for the accident. The older daughter feels her life is out of control and not what she wants. Dad, is a college professor. He has a contact in Genova, an old college friend, who tells him of a job. Italy may just be the place to chase their demons away. The city is indeed beautiful, and we see quite a lot of it. the back streets and channels as the girls walk their way to piano lessons each day. Life moves on slowly, the older daughter is exploring her sexuality and acting out. The younger child is left to deal with the daily life. The city and the back alleys and the maze of streets are a metaphor for the inner turmoil of each of the members of the family. It is a beautiful film, a quiet film that does not say much but brings to the surface the emotions that surround the family. These emotions are transported to the audience, and we are in a sense filled with anxiety waiting for the next move.

Five months after the accident they decide to leave Chicago and go to Genoa, Italy where his old college friend (beautifully played by Catherine Keener) finds him a summer job at the local university.Story unravels from here.  Each one of them has to come to terms with their loss.  They use their senses, new environment and beauty of Italy to deal with their grief and sadness.  Surely, their loss is too fresh, not even a year has passed and there seem to be opportunities of all kinds for each one of them to search for their peace: swimming in beautiful sea, visiting historical sites, taking piano lessons, learning Italian and of course, seeking physical pleasures to compensate for their emotional loss.Like in most stories, real or not, it takes only one critical moment to re-unite this fragmented family and reconcile their lives.

Having said this, I think there are times in the movie when one feels a lack of direction and some frustration to the meandering scenes that appear to repeat themselves without any kind of direction or intent. But then again it does mimic often how one tries to deal with a tragedy in one's own life.The story centers around a father and his two girls in Genoa for the summer to find closure after the tragic death of their mother.Instead of coming closer to each other, like the dark alleyways in Genoa, they go on separate paths.Once in Genoa, the father is lost between his feeling for one woman who is not as sexy, but more down to earth and responsible to the needs of his daughters and another woman who is carefree and liberating, but not interested in the family trappings. This only makes him more isolated to how he really feels as he is not yet ready for starting a relationship with either.The oldest daughter despite coming off as a superficial selfish sex crazed brat, seems trapped between her desire to feel needed by those outside of her family, but finding only teenage boys who are just as self-centered as herself. Hey she is an American teenager coming of age in Genoa with a confused father in denial and a little sister wracked with guilt for her mother's death. You'd look for emotional comfort elsewhere too!This leads to the youngest daughter, believing that she is the cause of her mother's death to the extent that she imagines her mother still alive and talking to her and touching her. It is like a subconscious hope that her mom will come back to still guide her in life (and soothe the guilt away), but reality just deepens her pain to the point of her behaving suicidal without consciously knowing it (not everyone will see this).In the end, let us just say they come to realize (by narrowly missing another family tragedy) that only by caring and comforting each other can they heal and enjoy life again.While I like the concept, I do wish the movie was a little more focused and involving, otherwise the same result could have been achieved as a short film instead.",3,No Closure & No Clue,1321228800,"11 14, 2011",2011,2334,"['reading', 'number', 'reviews', 'will', 'give', 'own', 'spin.This', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'jerking', 'film', 'using', 'extreme', 'scenes', 'tug', 'emotions', 'very', 'subtle', 'closer', 'normal', 'family', 'behavior', 'when', 'presented', 'tragedy', 'Having', 'said', 'think', 'are', 'times', 'movie', 'when', 'one', 'lack', 'direction', 'frustration', 'meandering', 'scenes', 'appear', 'repeat', 'kind', 'direction', 'intent', 'then', 'again', 'mimic', 'often', 'how', 'one', 'deal', 'tragedy', 'one', 'own', 'life.The', 'story', 'centers', 'father', 'two', 'girls', 'Genoa', 'summer', 'find', 'closure', 'tragic', 'death', 'mother.Instead', 'coming', 'closer', 'other', 'dark', 'Genoa', 'go', 'separate', 'paths.Once', 'Genoa', 'father', 'lost', 'feeling', 'one', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'sexy', 'more', 'down', 'earth', 'responsible', 'needs', 'daughters', 'woman', 'who', 'carefree', 'liberating', 'not', 'interested', 'family', 'trappings', 'only', 'more', 'isolated', 'how', 'really', 'not', 'yet', 'ready', 'starting', 'relationship', 'either.The', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'coming', 'off', 'superficial', 'selfish', 'sex', 'crazed', 'brat', 'trapped', 'desire', 'feel', 'needed', 'family', 'finding', 'only', 'teenage', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'self-centered', 'herself', 'Hey', 'American', 'teenager', 'coming', 'age', 'Genoa', 'confused', 'father', 'denial', 'little', 'sister', 'wracked', 'guilt', 'mother', 'death', ""'d"", 'look', 'emotional', 'comfort', 'elsewhere', 'too', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'believing', 'cause', 'mother', 'death', 'extent', 'mother', 'still', 'alive', 'talking', 'touching', 'subconscious', 'hope', 'mom', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'still', 'guide', 'life', 'soothe', 'guilt', 'away', 'reality', 'just', 'pain', 'point', 'behaving', 'suicidal', 'consciously', 'knowing', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'see', 'end', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'come', 'realize', 'narrowly', 'missing', 'family', 'tragedy', 'only', 'caring', 'comforting', 'other', 'can', 'heal', 'enjoy', 'life', 'like', 'concept', 'do', 'wish', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'focused', 'involving', 'otherwise', 'same', 'result', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'achieved', 'short', 'film', 'instead']",A Summer in Genoa
