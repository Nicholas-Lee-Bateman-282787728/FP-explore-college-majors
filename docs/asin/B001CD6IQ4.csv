1175862,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,B001CD6IQ4,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[12, 12]","My wee one loves everything Christmas and everything Little Einsteins, so this DVD, LITTLE EINSTEINS: THE CHRISTMAS WISH, was the perfect Christmas gift for her.  She has watched this DVD innumerable times since Christmas, and I know that she will continue to watch it throughout the year.  LITTLE EINSTEINS: THE CHRISTMAS WISH is clearly a new favorite.Like all Little Einsteins DVDs, LITTLE EINSTEINS: THE CHRISTMAS WISH contains several episodes, one of which had not been previously shown on TV at the time of release.  The four episodes include ""The Christmas Wish,"" ""The Northern Night Light,"" ""The Wind-Up Toy Prince,"" and ""Show and Tell.""  As always, each episode contains a featured phrase of classical music and a featured art piece.  Music selections from this DVD include Fur Elise, Flight of the Bumble Bee, The Nutcracker Suite, and Carmen Suite No. 1.  Art works included are ""Starry Night"" by Vincent Van Gogh, ""The Road in front of Saint-Sim&eacute;on Farm in Winter"" by Claude Monet, ""Little Dancer"" by Edgar Degas, and Mayan architecture.My 3  year old has been watching Little Einsteins since before she could speak, and in our house, they can do no wrong.  My child recognizes many classical music pieces and can ask for them by name.  She also recognizes many art pieces when she sees them out of her familiar context.  She can actually tell me what episode of Little Einsteins she first saw them in.  I am constantly amazed and dumbfounded by what she has learned and retained.If you have a Little Einstein lover in your house, then LITTLE EINSTEINS: THE CHRISTMAS WISH is a perfect gift, at any time of year.  It will get lots of play, and your kids will learn to recognize and appreciate classical music and beautiful art.  Disney has done a remarkable job with this series.  Kudos for such quality programming.",5,"Christmas With Leo, June, Quincy, Annie, And Rocket",1233878400,"02 6, 2009",2009,1836,"['wee', 'one', 'everything', 'Christmas', 'everything', 'Little', 'Einsteins', 'DVD', 'LITTLE', 'EINSTEINS', 'THE', 'CHRISTMAS', 'WISH', 'was', 'perfect', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'watched', 'DVD', 'innumerable', 'times', 'Christmas', 'know', 'will', 'continue', 'watch', 'year', 'LITTLE', 'EINSTEINS', 'CHRISTMAS', 'WISH', 'clearly', 'new', 'favorite.Like', 'Little', 'Einsteins', 'DVDs', 'LITTLE', 'EINSTEINS', 'THE', 'CHRISTMAS', 'WISH', 'several', 'episodes', 'one', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'previously', 'shown', 'TV', 'time', 'release', 'four', 'episodes', 'include', 'Christmas', 'Wish', 'Northern', 'Night', 'Light', 'Wind-Up', 'Toy', 'Prince', 'Show', 'Tell', 'always', 'episode', 'featured', 'phrase', 'classical', 'music', 'featured', 'art', 'piece', 'Music', 'selections', 'DVD', 'include', 'Fur', 'Elise', 'Flight', 'Bumble', 'Bee', 'Nutcracker', 'Suite', 'Carmen', 'Suite', 'No', '1', 'Art', 'included', 'are', 'Starry', 'Night', 'Vincent', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'Road', 'front', 'Saint-Sim', 'eacute', 'Farm', 'Winter', 'Claude', 'Monet', 'Little', 'Dancer', 'Edgar', 'Degas', 'Mayan', 'architecture.My', '3', 'year', 'old', 'been', 'watching', 'Little', 'Einsteins', 'could', 'speak', 'house', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'child', 'many', 'classical', 'music', 'pieces', 'can', 'ask', 'name', 'also', 'many', 'art', 'pieces', 'when', 'familiar', 'context', 'can', 'actually', 'tell', 'what', 'episode', 'Little', 'Einsteins', 'first', 'saw', 'am', 'constantly', 'amazed', 'dumbfounded', 'what', 'learned', 'retained.If', 'have', 'Little', 'Einstein', 'lover', 'house', 'then', 'LITTLE', 'EINSTEINS', 'THE', 'CHRISTMAS', 'WISH', 'perfect', 'gift', 'time', 'year', 'will', 'get', 'lots', 'play', 'kids', 'will', 'learn', 'recognize', 'appreciate', 'classical', 'music', 'beautiful', 'art', 'Disney', 'done', 'remarkable', 'job', 'series', 'Kudos', 'such', 'quality', 'programming']",Disney Little Einsteins: The Christmas Wish
