810358,A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1,B0001M2C4E,"Pat Nava ""Patrick &#34;The Lab Rat&#34;""","[1, 1]","The opening chart ""Hookin' It"" with Andy Fusco's great alto sax solo gives you a good idea of what's to come. Great brass section work closing it out.The following ""Brush Strokes"" shows Buddy's mastery of the brushes, and quiets the critics who thought he couldn't play anything but loud drum solos. Great technical work on the brushes.Andy Fusco is showcased on the chart ""If You Could See Me Now.""  I believe Andy was the best alto player Rich had in all the years of his big band. Even more exciting than Richie Cole, whom I thought was the best at the time of ""Keep The Customer Satisfied."" The song starts out as the usual ballad, but switches gears in the middle, and once again shows off Andy's great improvisational prowess. Then the song shifts back to the slower tempo to finish off another great Fusco performance.Bob Mintzer's ""Good News"" is a great 3-part suite that'll blow you away with the great opening, leading to a fantastic Steve Marcus solo cadenza. Then moving to a fast tempo for Buddy's solo. As noted, the trumpets missed the queue towards the end of Buddy's solo, and you'll notice he wasn't too pleased with it. But you'll also notice that the trumpets were grooving on his solo so much, which is why they missed the queue. Dave Stahl lends some great high note moments.""West Side Story"" will give you a short but sweet glimpse of the improvisational skills of Walt Weiskopf who handles the tenor solo (He would later play with Steely Dan, and on his own CD's-check him out). Of course, the Master Drummer does his thing, and the trumpets don't miss the queue this time.Don Menza's ""Time Check,""  always one of the most played and requested numbers by the Rich Band (Groovin' Hard being one of the others) is played at one of the fastest tempos I'd heard or seen this band play. Steve Marcus again shows why he was such a great soloist with this band. The sax soli is played super-fast, and Marcus has very little time from the end of his solo into the sax soli to catch his breath. But what a fantastic job by the entire band to take them out and close the show.",5,One of Buddy's tightest bands,1221177600,"09 12, 2008",2008,2090,"['opening', 'chart', 'Hookin', 'Andy', 'Fusco', 'great', 'alto', 'sax', 'solo', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'come', 'Great', 'brass', 'section', 'work', 'closing', 'following', 'Brush', 'Strokes', 'Buddy', 'mastery', 'brushes', 'critics', 'who', 'thought', 'could', ""n't"", 'play', 'anything', 'loud', 'drum', 'solos', 'Great', 'technical', 'work', 'brushes.Andy', 'Fusco', 'showcased', 'chart', 'Could', 'See', 'Me', 'Now', 'believe', 'Andy', 'was', 'best', 'alto', 'player', 'Rich', 'had', 'years', 'big', 'band', 'Even', 'more', 'exciting', 'Richie', 'Cole', 'whom', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'time', 'Keep', 'Customer', 'Satisfied', 'song', 'out', 'usual', 'ballad', 'gears', 'middle', 'once', 'again', 'Andy', 'great', 'improvisational', 'prowess', 'Then', 'song', 'back', 'slower', 'tempo', 'finish', 'off', 'great', 'Fusco', 'performance.Bob', 'Mintzer', 'Good', 'News', 'great', '3-part', 'suite', ""'ll"", 'blow', 'away', 'great', 'opening', 'leading', 'fantastic', 'Steve', 'Marcus', 'solo', 'cadenza', 'Then', 'moving', 'fast', 'tempo', 'Buddy', 'solo', 'noted', 'trumpets', 'missed', 'queue', 'end', 'Buddy', 'solo', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'pleased', ""'ll"", 'also', 'notice', 'trumpets', 'were', 'grooving', 'solo', 'so', 'much', 'why', 'missed', 'queue', 'Dave', 'Stahl', 'great', 'high', 'note', 'moments', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'will', 'give', 'short', 'sweet', 'glimpse', 'improvisational', 'skills', 'Walt', 'Weiskopf', 'who', 'tenor', 'solo', 'would', 'later', 'play', 'Steely', 'Dan', 'own', ""CD's-check"", 'out', 'course', 'Master', 'Drummer', 'thing', 'trumpets', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'queue', 'Menza', 'Time', 'Check', 'always', 'one', 'most', 'played', 'requested', 'numbers', 'Rich', 'Band', 'Groovin', 'Hard', 'being', 'one', 'others', 'played', 'one', 'fastest', 'tempos', ""'d"", 'heard', 'seen', 'band', 'play', 'Steve', 'Marcus', 'again', 'why', 'was', 'such', 'great', 'soloist', 'band', 'sax', 'soli', 'played', 'super-fast', 'Marcus', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'end', 'solo', 'sax', 'soli', 'catch', 'breath', 'what', 'fantastic', 'job', 'entire', 'band', 'take', 'out', 'close', 'show']",Buddy Rich: Live At The 1982 Montreal Jazz Festival
810359,A33KJZ6GCAUKOV,B0001M2C4E,Ronald K. Goodenow,"[15, 15]","I was originally going to give this four stars, with maybe a half knocked off because some of the band's arrangements were a bit ponderous and the video, which if clean and with good resolution, might be a tad better. But what the hell, forget all that stuff and just watch and listen to perhaps the greatest jazz drummer of all time at the height of his powers driving a band that looks just barely out of high school. It's hard to believe that the guy was 65 and only had five more years to live, getting cut down unexpectedly by a brain tumor. What knocked me over here is not the overall power of Buddy's drumming, but its delicacy (particularly some stunning brush work), which some superb camera work caught beautifully. And,yes, the sound is absolutely first rate.I've mentioned that some of the arrangements seem a bit ponderous. Like Stan Kenton, who also kept a big band going during this period, there's a tendency towards a rock beat that is great on rhythm (good thing for a drummer!) and ensemble playing, and sometimes weak on melody line, what with lots of pieces all sounding somewhat alike. Fortunately, this album balances some of this with terrific swinging pieces, including Buddy's somewhat signature West Side Story one, and a terrific Carioca. And, the bonus of a much earlier Green Dolphin Street captures one incredible bit of drumming.Buddy Rich was an original. This dvd (which I saw as demonstration for VHS over 20 years ago) is a big band treasure and Hudson is to be congratulated for bringing it out. I'm hoping that someone can find the tape of a PBS Tommy Dorsey special from about 18 years ago which featured Buddy, Mel Torme, Maureen McGovern, Buddy Morrow and Jack Jones. Buddy was at his best in one of his very last performances, and we got a hint of his work with one of the greatest of all big bands.",5,Hypnotic Drumming,1133654400,"12 4, 2005",2005,1842,"['was', 'originally', 'going', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'maybe', 'half', 'knocked', 'off', 'band', 'arrangements', 'were', 'bit', 'ponderous', 'video', 'clean', 'good', 'resolution', 'might', 'be', 'tad', 'better', 'what', 'hell', 'forget', 'stuff', 'just', 'watch', 'listen', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'jazz', 'drummer', 'time', 'height', 'powers', 'driving', 'band', 'just', 'barely', 'high', 'school', 'hard', 'believe', 'guy', 'was', '65', 'only', 'had', 'five', 'more', 'years', 'live', 'getting', 'cut', 'down', 'unexpectedly', 'brain', 'tumor', 'What', 'knocked', 'here', 'not', 'overall', 'power', 'Buddy', 'drumming', 'delicacy', 'particularly', 'stunning', 'brush', 'work', 'superb', 'camera', 'work', 'caught', 'beautifully', 'yes', 'sound', 'absolutely', 'first', 'rate.I', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'arrangements', 'seem', 'bit', 'ponderous', 'Stan', 'Kenton', 'who', 'also', 'kept', 'big', 'band', 'going', 'period', 'tendency', 'rock', 'beat', 'great', 'rhythm', 'good', 'thing', 'drummer', 'ensemble', 'playing', 'sometimes', 'weak', 'melody', 'line', 'what', 'lots', 'pieces', 'sounding', 'somewhat', 'alike', 'Fortunately', 'album', 'terrific', 'swinging', 'pieces', 'including', 'Buddy', 'somewhat', 'signature', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'one', 'terrific', 'Carioca', 'bonus', 'much', 'earlier', 'Green', 'Dolphin', 'Street', 'one', 'incredible', 'bit', 'drumming.Buddy', 'Rich', 'was', 'original', 'dvd', 'saw', 'demonstration', 'VHS', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'big', 'band', 'treasure', 'Hudson', 'be', 'congratulated', 'bringing', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'someone', 'can', 'find', 'tape', 'PBS', 'Tommy', 'Dorsey', 'special', '18', 'years', 'ago', 'featured', 'Buddy', 'Mel', 'Torme', 'Maureen', 'McGovern', 'Buddy', 'Morrow', 'Jack', 'Jones', 'Buddy', 'was', 'best', 'one', 'very', 'last', 'performances', 'got', 'hint', 'work', 'one', 'greatest', 'big', 'bands']",Buddy Rich: Live At The 1982 Montreal Jazz Festival

It showcases Buddy's technique across a full spectrum of sets, including brushwork on ""Brushstokes"".One of the highlights of this DVD is a bonus sequence of ""Green Dolphin Street"" (from 1972) that has one of Buddy's classic solos.  This sequence alone makes the DVD worth getting. An added bonus is the included soundtrack on CD that comes with the DVD.For the drummer wanting to learn a few tricks this is one of the best viedos of Buddy because there is ample camera exposure on his playing.  It's one thing to listen, but when you can see and listen it's a powerful combination for learning technique - and this video does just that.Tracks include Hookin' It, Brush Strokes, If They Could See Me Now, Good News, West Side Story Medley, Carioca, Time Check, Green Dolphin Street.If you are a Buddy Rich fan I also recommend getting the CD ""Buddy Rich Collection"" ASIN B00000DB1H, which is a remake of a 2-record set circa 1971.",5,Entertaining and instructional,1097366400,"10 10, 2004",2004,1035,"['drummer', 'who', 'learn', 'great', 'technique', 'merely', 'enjoy', 'great', 'drumming', 'will', 'appreciate', 'video', 'Buddy', 'technique', 'full', 'spectrum', 'sets', 'including', 'brushwork', 'Brushstokes', '.One', 'highlights', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'sequence', 'Green', 'Dolphin', 'Street', '1972', 'one', 'Buddy', 'classic', 'solos', 'sequence', 'alone', 'DVD', 'getting', 'added', 'bonus', 'included', 'soundtrack', 'CD', 'DVD.For', 'drummer', 'wanting', 'learn', 'few', 'tricks', 'one', 'best', 'viedos', 'Buddy', 'ample', 'camera', 'exposure', 'playing', 'one', 'thing', 'listen', 'when', 'can', 'see', 'listen', 'powerful', 'combination', 'learning', 'technique', 'video', 'just', 'that.Tracks', 'include', 'Hookin', 'Brush', 'Strokes', 'Could', 'See', 'Me', 'Now', 'Good', 'News', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'Medley', 'Carioca', 'Time', 'Check', 'Green', 'Dolphin', 'Street.If', 'are', 'Buddy', 'Rich', 'fan', 'also', 'recommend', 'getting', 'CD', 'Buddy', 'Rich', 'Collection', 'ASIN', 'B00000DB1H', 'remake', '2-record', 'set', 'circa', '1971']",Buddy Rich: Live At The 1982 Montreal Jazz Festival
