Of course it isn't over and done with, as we will see in Season Two (whenever it is released to us).  If I have any complaint about these episodes, the plot threads sometimes seem too simplistic and cliched for dealings with a criminal mastermind with truly enormous plans. The big shootout at the end was a contrivance belonging to TV westerns of the 50's, and as such seemed unsatisfactory to me.  Admittedly, this was a kid's action series.  But what comes off best are the developement of the central heroes of the series.  Diego (presumably a young man in his early 20's) becomes a little more human, and the hero-sidekick relationship between him and Bernardo, which started in the 4th DVD, begins to develope quite nicely. The sitcom elements that were always present seem more on the surface.  Fun to watch, like the others.",4,Pop goes the Eagle.,1178582400,"05 8, 2007",2007,951,"['last', 'story', 'arc', 'man', 'calling', 'Eagle', 'getting', 'killed', 'final', 'story', 'course', ""n't"", 'over', 'done', 'will', 'see', 'Season', 'Two', 'released', 'have', 'complaint', 'episodes', 'plot', 'threads', 'sometimes', 'seem', 'too', 'simplistic', 'cliched', 'dealings', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'truly', 'enormous', 'plans', 'big', 'shootout', 'end', 'was', 'contrivance', 'belonging', 'TV', 'westerns', '50', 'such', 'seemed', 'unsatisfactory', 'Admittedly', 'was', 'kid', 'action', 'series', 'what', 'off', 'best', 'are', 'developement', 'central', 'heroes', 'series', 'Diego', 'presumably', 'young', 'man', 'early', '20', 'little', 'more', 'human', 'hero-sidekick', 'relationship', 'Bernardo', 'started', '4th', 'DVD', 'develope', 'quite', 'nicely', 'sitcom', 'elements', 'were', 'always', 'present', 'seem', 'more', 'surface', 'Fun', 'watch', 'others']",N/A

1024211,A1TL2NCXVAIOIB,B000J1BWTI,"Michael Taylor ""real TV""","[3, 3]","The final volume of Season One begins to wind up the storyline of the Eagle.It has been a real pleasure to watch Zorro again and in color - though I admit I feel the original Black & White is far superior and suits the series better and in the 'Treasures' editions you see the series in its complete original form. But as I have said before - if you are a collector of anything Disney - hey why not treat yourself to both!The DVD quality is far from perfect in these color editions - perhaps Disney didn't expect much popularity in their movie club releases (yeah right!)This is common with most of their releases aimed at their Movie Club audience... grainy reproductions; poorly remastered editions in some cases and even poor editing. But the stories will always outweigh any limited faults in quality. This is so sad because every Disney production is a Treasure and collectors long to see TV episodes and movies as originally envisioned and with the reproduction advances available today with DVD - every new release should be given the 'Full Treatment'.Still I believe Disney are well aware that in whatever condition they release their product - people will buy it - just to rekindle fond memories of those long ago days and the opportunity to see again truly momentous classic movies & television - the like that will never come again!
