1156854,A34PAZQ73SL163,B0017DQFA8,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[7, 7]","Frank McCourt makes for an exquisite narrator on this stellar tour of the pubs of Dublin. I visited many of them as a youth and his wanderings brought back many a memory. Part of what adds to the viewer's amusement is the recognition of just how much Mr. McCourt is enjoying himself in the process of his travels. It seems that there's nowhere else he'd rather be and the magnitude of his own cheer became contagious. Furthermore, he has done an extensive amount of background research for each segment so his insights into the greater history of Ireland--within the context of its pubs--was quite illuminating. I particularly appreciated the segment on Brendan Behan, the ""drinker with a writing problem."" Overall, The Historic Pubs of Dublin was a treasured diversion.",5,Educational and Fun,1230249600,"12 26, 2008",2008,770,"['Frank', 'McCourt', 'exquisite', 'narrator', 'stellar', 'tour', 'pubs', 'Dublin', 'visited', 'many', 'youth', 'wanderings', 'brought', 'back', 'many', 'memory', 'Part', 'what', 'viewer', 'amusement', 'recognition', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'Mr.', 'McCourt', 'enjoying', 'process', 'travels', 'nowhere', 'else', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'magnitude', 'own', 'cheer', 'became', 'contagious', 'Furthermore', 'done', 'extensive', 'amount', 'background', 'research', 'segment', 'insights', 'greater', 'history', 'Ireland', 'context', 'pubs', 'was', 'quite', 'illuminating', 'particularly', 'appreciated', 'segment', 'Brendan', 'Behan', 'drinker', 'writing', 'problem', 'Overall', 'Historic', 'Pubs', 'Dublin', 'was', 'treasured', 'diversion']",Historic Pubs of Dublin

1156856,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B0017DQFA8,FYI,"[3, 3]","Alas, FYI was defeated by the Bladder of Gall on the Field of Duodenum. There's been a cessation of even meager imbibing. Quality over quantity was our motto, all that is left is the Vicarious Thrill. That's where this DVD comes in, watching the slightly tipsy, elfish writer Frank McCourt (Angela's Ashes: A Memoir) enjoy a little trip to Dublin that may leave you thirsty. At the classic, cozy pub ""Brazen Head,"" McCourt declares it doesn't look a day over 400. Images of the 1916 Easter Rising are reflected on many smoky pub walls. At visit to the Guinness Brewery, McCourt avows how this scrumptious beverage is a balm to nursing mothers. Clearly, Guinness aids drinkers with a ""writing problem."" The pub ""John Mulligan's"" is a tabernacle to the serious drinker, while ""Kavanagh's"" is the grave-diggers' bar. McCourt shows us Trinity College Library, where the angelic ""Book of Kells"" resides, then teases with the fine pub ""O'Neill's."" Later, he travels to the foothills of Dublin, to the musical ""Blue Light,"" and back to town to the richly adorned ""Stag's Head,"" built in the 1700s, redone in the Victorian era. McCourt walks through St. Patrick's Cathedral, and one of Dublin's unearthly green, beautiful parks, St. Stephan's.

In addition to teaching about the history of the island, it also helps the viewer understand the cultural meaning of pubs in Ireland.  We are planning a trip to Ireland this year and the DVD helped us select several historic pubs we would like to visit.
