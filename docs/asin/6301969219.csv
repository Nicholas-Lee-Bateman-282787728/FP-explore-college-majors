We all know how GWTW turned out but the story of how it was made is fascinating. David O. Selznick was nuts--- mad scientist nuts mixed with Motzart nuts and he just about drove everyone involved mad as well but he made a great movie. Can you imagine Erol Flynn as Rhett or Paulette Godard as Scarlet? Although Flynn was only in the running for the role for the blink of an eye Paulette almost got the role but luckily she lacked ambition and something in Selznick just made him keep on looking for a Scarlet until Vivian Leigh came to America.This is an exciting story and can be enjoyed either before watching GWTW again or on its own.,5,wonderful,1101427200,"11 26, 2004",2004,699,"['documentary', 'cleverly', 'done', 'very', 'entertaining', 'know', 'how', 'GWTW', 'turned', 'out', 'story', 'how', 'was', 'made', 'fascinating', 'David', 'O.', 'Selznick', 'was', 'mad', 'scientist', 'nuts', 'mixed', 'Motzart', 'nuts', 'just', 'drove', 'everyone', 'involved', 'mad', 'as', 'well', 'made', 'great', 'movie', 'Can', 'imagine', 'Erol', 'Flynn', 'Rhett', 'Paulette', 'Godard', 'Scarlet', 'Flynn', 'was', 'only', 'running', 'role', 'blink', 'eye', 'Paulette', 'almost', 'got', 'role', 'luckily', 'lacked', 'ambition', 'something', 'Selznick', 'just', 'made', 'keep', 'looking', 'Scarlet', 'Vivian', 'Leigh', 'came', 'America.This', 'exciting', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'GWTW', 'again', 'own']",N/A

280283,A14HHOT9999Z22,6301969219,"Stephen M. Moser ""The Austin Chronicle""","[49, 50]","Everything you ever wanted to know about *GWTW* -- from Margaret Mitchell recalling her mother driving her out to see the ruined plantations around Atlanta, and telling her that she'd better learn to survive, to its historic status as being one of the most beloved movies of all time - even when it's not politically correct to love the movie. It is a documentary combining spoken word, letters, memos, newsclips, diaries and recreations - in a comprehensive style that predates Ken Burns by quite a bit. It is a dizzying montage of information and images that tells the story of the film - a monumental achievement that is one of the few films to not disappoint the lovers of the book. Selznick purchased the rights to the story for $50,000 - a fortune at the time, for a story so sprawling that it was impossible to visualize on the screen. As a superb craftsman, even Selznick was intimidated - not just by the scope of the story, but by the public's obsession with it. So it is with tender care that he began preproduction and scriptwriting on this sacred monster. The footage that we see in the finished version of *GWTW* shows only a small part of the passion, heartache and bloodletting that went on behind the scenes. Most impressive is the existing array of screen tests that were done for the movie - evidence that the much-ballyhooed Search for Scarlett O'Hara was far more than hype from a hotheaded publicist. Showing dozens of would-be Scarletts, Melanies, Ashleys and Belles, the most stunning footage is the multiple and lengthy tests that Paulette Goddard did for the role of Scarlett. She exhibits a cunning and slyness that is perfect for Scarlett, and the newsreports go crazy announcing her unconfirmed appointment. It is the sheer numbers of tests that Goddard did the continually amazing, and she had every reason on earth to believe she had the part. It's easy to see that she would have been delightful as Scarlett, but could she have made Scarlett into the legend that Vivian Leigh did? Fraught with tension, shooting began without Scarlett having been cast. The story behind the filming of the burning of Atlanta is riveting in its detail, showing how old sets from *King Kong* and *Birth of a Nation*, among others, were burned and then multiplied on film to create the effect. It was during the filming of this sequence that Selznick's brother, Myron, legendarily arrived on the set with a gorgeous young woman in tow and said to the producer, ""I'd like you to meet your Scarlett."" And the film's fate was sealed with the casting of the tragic and incandescent Vivian Leigh. Though Selznick was reviled by Hedda Hopper, among others, for casting an English girl, instead of a red-blooded American, even Margaret Mitchell herself said, ""Better and English girl than a Yankee."" Goddard had been frontrunner up to the last second when Leigh waltzed in and stole the part from under her nose. It must have been an unbearably bitter disappointment, and Goddard never again realized the potential she showed in these tests. But, it is also only a small facet of what happened behind the scenes. After a time, miles of film were scrapped when original director George Cukor was fired and replaced by Victor Fleming. There's quite a tale behind *that* that neither the documentary, nor we, will go into. The personal dramas are many, with Selznick's drug use, health problems and subsequent breakdown being addressed. The volume of information collected is awesome. From Butterfly McQueen speaking about her role as Prissy (""I wouldn't let them slap me, but I thought Prissy needed to be slapped...I thought she was horrid.""), to the footage of Hattie MacDaniel's Academy Award speech that is so sincere and touching that it must be considered a gift that we can still see it. It was a scandal that the movie cost $3,000,000 to make: a jaw-droppingly small figure for a movie that paid for itself many, many times over - and *that's* just in financial terms.",5,Excellent Documentary,981244800,"02 4, 2001",2001,3979,"['Everything', 'ever', 'wanted', 'know', '*GWTW*', 'Margaret', 'Mitchell', 'recalling', 'mother', 'driving', 'see', 'ruined', 'plantations', 'Atlanta', 'telling', ""'d"", 'better', 'learn', 'survive', 'historic', 'status', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'movies', 'time', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'politically', 'correct', 'love', 'movie', 'documentary', 'combining', 'spoken', 'word', 'letters', 'memos', 'newsclips', 'diaries', 'recreations', 'comprehensive', 'style', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'quite', 'bit', 'dizzying', 'montage', 'information', 'images', 'story', 'film', 'monumental', 'achievement', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'not', 'disappoint', 'lovers', 'book', 'Selznick', 'purchased', 'rights', 'story', '50,000', 'fortune', 'time', 'story', 'so', 'sprawling', 'was', 'impossible', 'visualize', 'screen', 'superb', 'craftsman', 'even', 'Selznick', 'was', 'intimidated', 'not', 'just', 'scope', 'story', 'public', 'obsession', 'tender', 'care', 'began', 'preproduction', 'scriptwriting', 'sacred', 'monster', 'footage', 'see', 'finished', 'version', '*GWTW*', 'only', 'small', 'part', 'passion', 'heartache', 'bloodletting', 'went', 'scenes', 'Most', 'impressive', 'existing', 'array', 'screen', 'tests', 'were', 'done', 'movie', 'evidence', 'much-ballyhooed', 'Search', 'Scarlett', ""O'Hara"", 'was', 'far', 'more', 'hype', 'hotheaded', 'publicist', 'Showing', 'dozens', 'would-be', 'Scarletts', 'Melanies', 'Ashleys', 'Belles', 'most', 'stunning', 'footage', 'multiple', 'lengthy', 'tests', 'Paulette', 'Goddard', 'did', 'role', 'Scarlett', 'cunning', 'slyness', 'perfect', 'Scarlett', 'newsreports', 'go', 'crazy', 'announcing', 'unconfirmed', 'appointment', 'sheer', 'numbers', 'tests', 'Goddard', 'did', 'continually', 'amazing', 'had', 'reason', 'earth', 'believe', 'had', 'part', 'easy', 'see', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'delightful', 'Scarlett', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'Scarlett', 'legend', 'Vivian', 'Leigh', 'did', 'Fraught', 'tension', 'shooting', 'began', 'Scarlett', 'having', 'been', 'cast', 'story', 'filming', 'burning', 'Atlanta', 'riveting', 'detail', 'showing', 'how', 'old', 'sets', '*King', 'Kong*', '*Birth', 'Nation*', 'others', 'were', 'burned', 'then', 'multiplied', 'film', 'create', 'effect', 'was', 'filming', 'sequence', 'Selznick', 'brother', 'Myron', 'legendarily', 'arrived', 'set', 'gorgeous', 'young', 'woman', 'tow', 'said', 'producer', ""'d"", 'like', 'meet', 'Scarlett', 'film', 'fate', 'was', 'sealed', 'casting', 'tragic', 'incandescent', 'Vivian', 'Leigh', 'Though', 'Selznick', 'was', 'reviled', 'Hedda', 'Hopper', 'others', 'casting', 'English', 'girl', 'instead', 'red-blooded', 'American', 'even', 'Margaret', 'Mitchell', 'said', 'Better', 'English', 'girl', 'Yankee', 'Goddard', 'had', 'been', 'frontrunner', 'up', 'last', 'second', 'when', 'Leigh', 'waltzed', 'stole', 'part', 'nose', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'unbearably', 'bitter', 'disappointment', 'Goddard', 'never', 'again', 'realized', 'potential', 'showed', 'tests', 'also', 'only', 'small', 'facet', 'what', 'happened', 'scenes', 'time', 'miles', 'film', 'were', 'scrapped', 'when', 'original', 'director', 'George', 'Cukor', 'was', 'fired', 'replaced', 'Victor', 'Fleming', 'quite', 'tale', '*that*', 'documentary', 'will', 'go', 'personal', 'dramas', 'are', 'many', 'Selznick', 'drug', 'use', 'health', 'problems', 'subsequent', 'breakdown', 'being', 'addressed', 'volume', 'information', 'collected', 'awesome', 'Butterfly', 'McQueen', 'speaking', 'role', 'Prissy', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'slap', 'thought', 'Prissy', 'needed', 'be', 'slapped', 'thought', 'was', 'horrid', 'footage', 'Hattie', 'MacDaniel', 'Academy', 'Award', 'speech', 'so', 'sincere', 'touching', 'must', 'be', 'considered', 'gift', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'was', 'scandal', 'movie', 'cost', '3,000,000', 'make', 'jaw-droppingly', 'small', 'figure', 'movie', 'paid', 'many', 'many', 'times', ""*that's*"", 'just', 'financial', 'terms']",N/A

280286,A2ZHSORK1HHYTT,6301969219,Willy D. Reviewer,"[0, 0]","Excellent reviews.  Clark Gable should have won the Academy Award that year.Only three comments, all about Clark Gable.(1) Errol Flynn was describe in this documentary as a second rate Clark Gable.  Flynn was actually higher up on the A-List than Gable at this time, and his films were more successful and popular than Gable's.  Olivia De Havilland said Flynn would have been her #1 choice for Rhett, and there was never a consensus taken by the readers of Gone With The Wind that Gable was their overwhelming choice.  That opinion seemed to have originated at the MGM publicity department, so Mayer (who owned Gable's contract) could have leverage on his son-in-law Selznick.(2) This documentary also states that it was primarily the continual artistic fights between director Cukor and producer Selznick (which Selznick had with every director), and secondarily Gable's concern that Cukor was giving all of his attention to the females in the cast, that lead to director Cukor's dismissal.  There are other documents that state it was Gable who forced the issue and said that Cukor must go or he will become sick and not come out of his dressing room -- thereby tying up production for several weeks.  Selznick, looking at the daily rushes, agreed that Cukor was only directing the females and Selznick could not afford the down time caused by Gable's ""illness"".(3) And best of all: There is a famous picture of all the principals on the dais at a studio dinner party after filming was completed, and the press were invited.  (The documentary only mentioned an earlier ""wrap"" cocktail party.)  All of the principals were given an autographed copy of Gone With The Wind by Margaret Mitchell.  Gable opened his book as dinner was served, saw the writing, and asked if couldn't have a book that didn't have writing in it.  He wanted a ""new book"" and not a ""used book"".  This is documented by those in attendance.There is another story about Gable, when he was voted by Photoplay magazine as being the #1 Hollywood star, he went duck hunting with William Falkner (author, Nobel Prize in Literature, screenwriter) and neither one had ever heard of the other.Also, in Hollywood, it was definitely agreed that Carol Lombard (his wife) was intellectually superior to her husband Gable.  Joan Crawford (one time lover of Gable) is reported to have told a friend that he was the best lover she ever had -- ""but so dumb"".  On the Jack Parr show she said he was the love of her life (this was in the 1960's).",5,Great -- With A Few Gable Exceptions,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,2498,"['Excellent', 'reviews', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'year.Only', 'three', 'comments', 'Clark', 'Gable', '1', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'was', 'describe', 'documentary', 'second', 'rate', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Flynn', 'was', 'actually', 'higher', 'up', 'A-List', 'Gable', 'time', 'films', 'were', 'more', 'successful', 'popular', 'Gable', 'Olivia', 'De', 'Havilland', 'said', 'Flynn', 'would', 'have', 'been', '1', 'choice', 'Rhett', 'was', 'never', 'consensus', 'taken', 'readers', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Gable', 'was', 'overwhelming', 'choice', 'opinion', 'seemed', 'have', 'originated', 'MGM', 'publicity', 'department', 'Mayer', 'who', 'owned', 'Gable', 'contract', 'could', 'have', 'leverage', 'son-in-law', 'Selznick', '2', 'documentary', 'also', 'was', 'primarily', 'continual', 'artistic', 'fights', 'director', 'Cukor', 'producer', 'Selznick', 'Selznick', 'had', 'director', 'secondarily', 'Gable', 'concern', 'Cukor', 'was', 'giving', 'attention', 'females', 'cast', 'lead', 'director', 'Cukor', 'dismissal', 'are', 'other', 'documents', 'state', 'was', 'Gable', 'who', 'forced', 'issue', 'said', 'Cukor', 'must', 'go', 'will', 'become', 'sick', 'not', 'come', 'dressing', 'room', 'thereby', 'tying', 'up', 'production', 'several', 'weeks', 'Selznick', 'looking', 'daily', 'rushes', 'agreed', 'Cukor', 'was', 'only', 'directing', 'females', 'Selznick', 'could', 'not', 'afford', 'down', 'time', 'caused', 'Gable', 'illness', '3', 'best', 'famous', 'picture', 'principals', 'dais', 'studio', 'dinner', 'party', 'filming', 'was', 'completed', 'press', 'were', 'invited', 'documentary', 'only', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'wrap', 'cocktail', 'party', 'principals', 'were', 'given', 'autographed', 'copy', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Margaret', 'Mitchell', 'Gable', 'opened', 'book', 'dinner', 'was', 'served', 'saw', 'writing', 'asked', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'writing', 'wanted', 'new', 'book', 'not', 'used', 'book', 'documented', 'attendance.There', 'story', 'Gable', 'when', 'was', 'voted', 'Photoplay', 'magazine', 'being', '1', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'went', 'duck', 'hunting', 'William', 'Falkner', 'author', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'Literature', 'screenwriter', 'one', 'had', 'ever', 'heard', 'other.Also', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'definitely', 'agreed', 'Carol', 'Lombard', 'wife', 'was', 'intellectually', 'superior', 'husband', 'Gable', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'one', 'time', 'lover', 'Gable', 'reported', 'have', 'told', 'friend', 'was', 'best', 'lover', 'ever', 'had', 'so', 'dumb', 'Jack', 'Parr', 'show', 'said', 'was', 'love', 'life', 'was', '1960']",N/A
