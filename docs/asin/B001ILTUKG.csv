1204611,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B001ILTUKG,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[6, 6]","'The Taking of Power by Louis XIV' concerns the short period of time between the death of Cardinal Mazerin - the real power behind the French throne - and when the future Sun King consolidates his autonomy.  Directed by famed neorealist Roberto Rossellini toward the end of his career for French television, the film is fascinating in its depiction of 17th century habits and customs, although emotionless and somewhat dry also.  It ends up being a peculiar film, probably most appealing to history buffs of this particular period, and film enthusiasts who will want to breakdown Rossellini's technique.  By no means is it reserved only for these two groups, but I do think it's safe to say that this film does not indulge in the dramatic (often melodramatic) 'hooks' that often distinguish more contemporary period films - as was, apparently, Rossellini's intention.Criterion, as usual, does a nice job with the extras on the disc, one of which, a 'multimedia' essay (film clips are shown to illustrate the narration), I thought neatly explained many of Rossellini's directorial quirks, and added an entirely new dimension to the film.  Jean-Marie Patte, who played the title role, was not a professional actor, although Rossellini supposedly used his wooden and unemotional acting to reflect certain qualities he wanted the audience to associate with Louis.  That's all well and good if the viewer picks that up as they are watching the film - unfortunately I'm not that observant.  I only end up feeling slightly uncomfortable at how uncomfortable Patte looks in the role.  Not until after the 'essay' do I see what Rossellini was striving for - and I have to admit that I don't buy all of it, but I still found it extremely worthwhile as a short education on filmmaking.Other extras are more concerned with the director rather than this particular film - and I found the documentary about Rossellini's later years to be most interesting.  Evidently he was enamored with the new medium of television, seeing in it an opportunity for education and moral instruction, which explains many of the historical figures he chose to present in his last years.  That attitude alone seems a bit morally instructive to me.While there are certain elements to 'Power' that I thought were striking to the point of surrealism (near the end in the garden of Versailles, for one), there is also an inescapable feel to the film that reminds me of reenactment scenes from high school history class movies.  That isn't a mark against the film so much as an attempt to describe its mood.  Because of its odd nature, I'd advise potential viewers that they rent before they buy - while I enjoyed the film and recommend it, I'd be surprised if I ever feel the need to watch it again.The film is presented in a 4 x 3 aspect ratio, and looks much like one might expect a television program from the mid-sixties to look like.",4,A narrow recommendation,1307750400,"06 11, 2011",2011,2900,"[""'The"", 'Taking', 'Power', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'concerns', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'death', 'Cardinal', 'Mazerin', 'real', 'power', 'French', 'throne', 'when', 'future', 'Sun', 'King', 'autonomy', 'Directed', 'famed', 'neorealist', 'Roberto', 'Rossellini', 'end', 'career', 'French', 'television', 'film', 'fascinating', 'depiction', '17th', 'century', 'habits', 'customs', 'emotionless', 'somewhat', 'dry', 'also', 'up', 'being', 'peculiar', 'film', 'probably', 'most', 'appealing', 'history', 'buffs', 'particular', 'period', 'film', 'enthusiasts', 'who', 'will', 'want', 'breakdown', 'Rossellini', 'technique', 'means', 'reserved', 'only', 'two', 'groups', 'do', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'film', 'not', 'indulge', 'dramatic', 'often', 'melodramatic', 'often', 'more', 'contemporary', 'period', 'films', 'was', 'apparently', 'Rossellini', 'intention.Criterion', 'usual', 'nice', 'job', 'extras', 'disc', 'one', ""'multimedia"", 'essay', 'film', 'clips', 'are', 'shown', 'illustrate', 'narration', 'thought', 'neatly', 'explained', 'many', 'Rossellini', 'directorial', 'quirks', 'added', 'entirely', 'new', 'dimension', 'film', 'Jean-Marie', 'Patte', 'who', 'played', 'title', 'role', 'was', 'not', 'professional', 'actor', 'Rossellini', 'supposedly', 'used', 'wooden', 'unemotional', 'acting', 'reflect', 'certain', 'qualities', 'wanted', 'audience', 'associate', 'Louis', 'well', 'good', 'viewer', 'picks', 'up', 'are', 'watching', 'film', 'unfortunately', ""'m"", 'not', 'observant', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'slightly', 'uncomfortable', 'how', 'uncomfortable', 'Patte', 'role', 'Not', ""'essay"", 'do', 'see', 'what', 'Rossellini', 'was', 'striving', 'have', 'admit', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'still', 'found', 'extremely', 'worthwhile', 'short', 'education', 'filmmaking.Other', 'extras', 'are', 'more', 'concerned', 'director', 'rather', 'particular', 'film', 'found', 'documentary', 'Rossellini', 'later', 'years', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'Evidently', 'was', 'enamored', 'new', 'medium', 'television', 'seeing', 'opportunity', 'education', 'moral', 'instruction', 'many', 'historical', 'figures', 'chose', 'present', 'last', 'years', 'attitude', 'alone', 'bit', 'morally', 'instructive', 'me.While', 'are', 'certain', 'elements', ""'Power"", 'thought', 'were', 'striking', 'point', 'surrealism', 'end', 'garden', 'Versailles', 'one', 'also', 'inescapable', 'feel', 'film', 'reenactment', 'scenes', 'high', 'school', 'history', 'class', 'movies', ""n't"", 'mark', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'attempt', 'describe', 'mood', 'odd', 'nature', ""'d"", 'advise', 'potential', 'viewers', 'rent', 'buy', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'recommend', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'ever', 'feel', 'need', 'watch', 'again.The', 'film', 'presented', '4', 'x', '3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'much', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'television', 'program', 'mid-sixties', 'look']",N/A

In it, a historian of film cites one of the most impressive features of the film as the casting of Louis XIV.  The actor became so timid in front of the character, as to have been rendered unable to look any other actor in the face and to have to read his lines from cue cards off camera.  The resulting timid childishness in the performance is hailed as a stroke of brilliance in Rosselini's casting.If you subscribe to that bit of brainwashing, this is the film for you.&#34;The Taking of Power of Louis XIV&#34; might as well be called &#34;The Taking Of A Nap by The Unfortunate Viewer&#34;.",1,The Taking Of A Nap,1399507200,"05 8, 2014",2014,691,"['documentary', 'concerning', 'film', 'contained', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'edition', 'historian', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'features', 'film', 'casting', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'actor', 'became', 'so', 'timid', 'front', 'character', 'have', 'been', 'rendered', 'unable', 'look', 'other', 'actor', 'face', 'have', 'read', 'lines', 'cue', 'cards', 'off', 'camera', 'resulting', 'timid', 'childishness', 'performance', 'hailed', 'stroke', 'brilliance', 'Rosselini', 'casting.If', 'subscribe', 'bit', 'brainwashing', 'film', 'you.', '34', 'Taking', 'Power', 'Louis', 'XIV', '34', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'called', '34', 'Taking', 'A', 'Nap', 'Unfortunate', 'Viewer', '34']",N/A
1204613,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B001ILTUKG,C. O. DeRiemer,"[30, 31]","Roberto Rossellini was an intriguing director who made a handful of great films and an awful lot of mish mash. While Rossellini never found much popular acclaim for most of his movies, he certainly found it among some of his fellow directors, notably Truffaut and Scorsese. Whether that means Rossellini was a great director might depend on how you much you appreciate artists praising each other. It is, however, just about impossible to underestimate Rossellini's impact on neorealism in movies, just as it's impossible not to take seriously any director who could makeOpen City, Paisan andIl Generale Della Rovere.So what is The Taking of Power by Louis XIV? Rossellini made it for French television when his career and reputation had faded. He was 60, and would be dead eleven years later. He still made movies regularly and, increasingly, worked in television on major presentations. He made movies because this is what directors do. He wasn't forgotten, exactly, and there were those who saw in him the neorealistic genius he once was. Perhaps he forgot along the way that the story must engage, and that dedicated technique may not always be enough. If Luigi Minecolli had been the director of The Taking of Power by Louis XIV instead of a director named Roberto Rossellini, would the TV production be remembered, even by cineastes? Well, who remembers the director ofThe First Churchills?Louis, in 1661, is about to grasp the power of his throne. He's 22 years old and has worn the crown since just before his fifth birthday. The death of the power behind the throne, Cardinal Mazarin, gives Louis the opportunity to be the king, not just play at it. Louis succeeds so well we remember him as The Sun King. (Of course, for his last couple of decades he should be better remembered as The Death, Disaster and Crushing-Taxes-for-Everybody-But-the-Nobility King. But all this is another story.)Rossellini not only shows us the intrigue, the primping, the groveling and the backstabbing that come with the accumulation of power, he shows us those realistic details that make cardinals and kings into men, not always inspiring men and sometimes dead men. This was a time when physicians diagnosed by way of a whiff of the chamber pot and who bled their patients with abandon. The death of Mazarin begins the movie, and the Cardinal's confession to his priest is amusingly self-serving. This scene, as with the movie, is so deliberate and calm as to want us to help speed God's hand in closing the Cardinal's eyes. The Cardinal has a lot of exposition to deal with before that happens.And when it does, Louis, to the consternation of his ministers, his courtiers and his powerful mother, begins to make decisions for himself. There is intrigue, ego, avarice and ambition...and it all proceeds with such stateliness that it would be very hard going without all those magnificent wigs, velvet curtains, lush costumes, beplumed hats and the stultifying but amusing rules and courtesies of the court. Louis himself, played by Jean-Marie Patte, is a plump, short, shallow, spoiled but sly young man, who much prefers skinny dipping with his mistress than amorous visits to his wife. He sounds like Peter Ustinov. He looks ridiculous in his high wigs and his beribboned, belaced and bevelveted knickers. Louis must deal with his mother, with Fouquet, with the building of Versailles, with bringing the nobility to heel and with all those elaborate, lengthy 17-course meals he would eat in solitary splendor in front of his courtiers and ladies. In many ways the preparation of one of these meals, its nervous supervision, stately serving and blank-eyed consumption by the king is the best sequence in the movie.I have no idea if Patte was simply a limited actor or whether he was directed poorly. One critic reports that Rossellini would not give the actors their dialogue until just before a scene, and insisted that they use written cheat boards out of camera range if they had trouble. If this is the case, we can only sympathize with Patte, who is forced to speak in ponderous epigrams and declarations of shrewd and emotionless intent.The taking of power by Louis XIV...the history...is a great and dramatic story. The movie, on the other hand, looks just fine and, if you enjoy the high doings of those convinced they are our betters, interesting. But the teleplay also is dull, dispassionate and without pace. Patte's acting leaves a great void in the center of the story. Rossellini has produced a lavish, stately teleplay about a French king, undoubtedly exactly what his French producers wanted. I don't believe there is a trace to be seen of the Rossellini of Open City and Paisan. Is the movie worth four stars? Just barely.This Criterion release looks just what it is, an older television program that has been well preserved. There are three extras that deal with Rossellini, his ""history"" films and the making of this one.",4,"The Sun King takes over, and Roberto Rossellini was there",1234224000,"02 10,

In retrospect, my dreams were more entertaining.  Louis XIV created the largest, most opulent palace in Europe (Versailles) that was the envy of Europe (and spawned numerous copy-cats), was constantly surrounded by mistresses, and was constantly at war to promote the glory of France, and promoted himself as the ""Sun King""...in short, he was not the cowering, insecure and boring individual portrayed in this film (although in reality Louis XIV was short in stature).

1204615,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B001ILTUKG,Doug Anderson,"[0, 0]","History films: It's interesting to me that beginning in the 1960's (one of the most fascinating cultural moments in our history) Rossellini turns away from the present and begins documenting the past.  Maybe one reason for this is that his fellow countrymen (Fellini, Antonioni) and the French (Godard and Co) are much better at understanding 1960's culture than he is. Rossellini's signature realism seemed perfectly suited to presenting the bare facts of existence (peasants and priests seem to be his favorite characters) but in the 1950's directors like Bresson and Bergman begin exploring more complex psychologies and this requires a more subjective kind of cinema. Bresson seems to be the 1950's filmmaker most captivated by Rossellini's style and subject matter (Bresson documents mostly working class folk although his priest is not a man of the people but someone with a subjectivity that makes him feel alienated from the people).  Bergman and Fellini move away from working class characters and concerns as their careers progress and their most famous early 1960's work focuses on upper middle class characters and concerns. As for the French New Wave filmmakers, Truffaut `s 400 Blows is a working class film but most of the other New Wavers focus on more sophisticated subjectivities (even when Godard does explore the life of a working class girl it is obvious he is not speaking to a working class audience but to an art film audience).  Sometimes history films are just as much about the present as they are about the past (and when Rivette made The Nun in 1966 it was clear the he was discussing the present just as much as the past) but it's hard to find anything in Taking of Power by Louis XIV that seems to be relevant to early 1960's Europe.  In a time when filmmakers were evolving new ways to address new social realities and new kinds of subjectivities, Rossellini seems to shun subjectivity altogether. His clinical style does not foreground character or subjectivity or even story, it just foregrounds the deliberate way Louis reigned in his unruly elites.  The most interesting scene I suppose is the final one when Louis leaves his carefully crafted stage ( the lawns and steps of Versailles) and seeks solitude in the inner sanctum of his library and solace in his favorite books (which iterate his world view even though that world view really provides no solace)-----I could not help imagining this is also what Rossellini was doing in the early 60's while other filmmakers were trying to make sense of a present that was not so easily ruled.  Of course the style of the film is strangely infectious and it clearly made an impression on Bresson who would later try out this historical style in his own historical epic (or anti-epic) Lancelot of the Lake.  And it made an impression on Kubrick and informs his historical epic Barry Lyndon. And on Herzog. Although in Herzog's film, Heart of Glass, it is not a leader  or cultural style that hypnotizes the masses but an economic secret (a formula that turns glass red).  I suppose you can still detect the lasting influence of this detached, clinical style in Bela Tarr's films. Although Tarr is interested in the post-Nietzschean, the existential , whereas Rossellini seems fascinated with returning to what came before.",3,Odd History Film,1381276800,"10 9, 2013",2013,3303,"['History', 'films', 'interesting', 'beginning', '1960', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'cultural', 'moments', 'history', 'Rossellini', 'away', 'present', 'documenting', 'past', 'Maybe', 'one', 'reason', 'fellow', 'countrymen', 'Fellini', 'Antonioni', 'French', 'Godard', 'Co', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'understanding', '1960', 'culture', 'Rossellini', 'signature', 'realism', 'seemed', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'presenting', 'bare', 'facts', 'existence', 'peasants', 'priests', 'seem', 'be', 'favorite', 'characters', '1950', 'directors', 'Bresson', 'Bergman', 'begin', 'exploring', 'more', 'complex', 'psychologies', 'more', 'subjective', 'kind', 'cinema', 'Bresson', 'be', '1950', 'filmmaker', 'most', 'captivated', 'Rossellini', 'style', 'subject', 'matter', 'Bresson', 'documents', 'mostly', 'working', 'class', 'folk', 'priest', 'not', 'man', 'people', 'someone', 'subjectivity', 'feel', 'alienated', 'people', 'Bergman', 'Fellini', 'move', 'away', 'working', 'class', 'characters', 'concerns', 'careers', 'progress', 'most', 'famous', 'early', '1960', 'work', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'characters', 'concerns', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'filmmakers', 'Truffaut', 's', '400', 'Blows', 'working', 'class', 'film', 'most', 'other', 'New', 'Wavers', 'focus', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'subjectivities', 'even', 'when', 'Godard', 'explore', 'life', 'working', 'class', 'girl', 'obvious', 'not', 'speaking', 'working', 'class', 'audience', 'art', 'film', 'audience', 'Sometimes', 'history', 'films', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'present', 'are', 'past', 'when', 'Rivette', 'made', 'Nun', '1966', 'was', 'clear', 'was', 'discussing', 'present', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'past', 'hard', 'find', 'anything', 'Taking', 'Power', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'be', 'relevant', 'early', '1960', 'Europe', 'time', 'when', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'evolving', 'new', 'ways', 'address', 'new', 'social', 'realities', 'new', 'kinds', 'subjectivities', 'Rossellini', 'shun', 'subjectivity', 'altogether', 'clinical', 'style', 'not', 'foreground', 'character', 'subjectivity', 'even', 'story', 'just', 'deliberate', 'way', 'Louis', 'reigned', 'unruly', 'elites', 'most', 'interesting', 'scene', 'suppose', 'final', 'one', 'when', 'Louis', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'stage', 'lawns', 'steps', 'Versailles', 'solitude', 'inner', 'sanctum', 'library', 'solace', 'favorite', 'books', 'iterate', 'world', 'view', 'even', 'world', 'view', 'really', 'solace', '-I', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'imagining', 'also', 'what', 'Rossellini', 'was', 'doing', 'early', '60', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'present', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'easily', 'ruled', 'course', 'style', 'film', 'strangely', 'infectious', 'clearly', 'made', 'impression', 'Bresson', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'try', 'out', 'historical', 'style', 'own', 'historical', 'epic', 'anti-epic', 'Lancelot', 'Lake', 'made', 'impression', 'Kubrick', 'informs', 'historical', 'epic', 'Barry', 'Lyndon', 'Herzog', 'Herzog', 'film', 'Heart', 'Glass', 'not', 'leader', 'cultural', 'style', 'masses', 'economic', 'secret', 'formula', 'glass', 'red', 'suppose', 'can', 'still', 'detect', 'lasting', 'influence', 'detached', 'clinical', 'style', 'Bela', 'Tarr', 'films', 'Tarr', 'interested', 'post-Nietzschean', 'existential', 'whereas', 'Rossellini', 'fascinated', 'returning', 'what', 'came', 'before']",N/A
1204616,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B001ILTUKG,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[17, 17]","This was one of Rossellini's first TV films, shot for French TV near the end of his career.  Rossellini has been the least of my favorite filmmakers from Italy, not because he isn't talented, but I just never got into his films like I did the other famous Italian filmmakers.  But after having viewed this film (and his subsequent TV work), I respect him much more, and these later films are my favorites of his work.This film, shot for French television, is a cousin to Rossellini's historical films of the Enlightenment (The Age of Medici, Cartesius, and Blaise Pascal).  This may be the best out of all four of those films.  It's the most visually opulent of the four films, with stunning costumes and set design, and photographically it's beautiful.  That's quite astounding considering it was shot on 16mm film, which doesn't age very well.  Kudos to Criterion for restoring it well.  While the performances in the Italian TV films were mostly perfunctory, in this film they are livelier and more interesting.  It could be because Rossellini was working with direct sound (something he never did in his Italian films), and the performances are enriched because of that.  Jean Marie Patte, who plays the king, is stiff at times, obviously reading from cue cards in a few scenes.  Rossellini gave his actors their lines just before they shot, and had cue cards on the set if they couldn't remember, so it's not all Jean Marie's fault.  It's a bit distracting, but it doesn't detract too much from the overall experience of the film.There are some striking scenes in the film, one near the end film in a garden, and when a key rival of Louis is arrested.  The courtoom intrigue is absolutely fascinating.  There are also surprising parallels between today's world and the world inherited by Louis XIV.  It's also fascinating to see Louis mature from a shy, spoiled, hedonisitic person to a mature, solid, and shrewd politican/king.It's also unnerving to see doctors at the beginning of the film tend to Mazarin  who leaves his fortune to Louis (the doctors, learned men of their time, bleed Mazarin in hopes of healing him.  They also smell his chamber pot).  The film is very dry, talky, and intellectual, so if you're expecting an HBO series that's occasionally historically accurate but shows gratuitous sex just because they can, you should skip this (even though they are funny scenes in the film dealing with sex).  If you adjust to the rhythms and sensibility of The Taking of Power by Louis XIV, it's absolutely fascinating stuff.",5,"Fascinating, difficult, intellectual, dry, immensely watchable...",1249516800,"08 6, 2009",2009,2540,"['was', 'one', 'Rossellini', 'first', 'TV', 'films', 'shot', 'French', 'TV', 'end', 'career', 'Rossellini', 'been', 'least', 'favorite', 'filmmakers', 'Italy', 'not', ""n't"", 'talented', 'just', 'never', 'got', 'films', 'did', 'other', 'famous', 'Italian', 'filmmakers', 'having', 'viewed', 'film', 'subsequent', 'TV', 'work', 'respect', 'much', 'more', 'later', 'films', 'are', 'favorites', 'work.This', 'film', 'shot', 'French', 'television', 'cousin', 'Rossellini', 'historical', 'films', 'Enlightenment', 'Age', 'Medici', 'Cartesius', 'Blaise', 'Pascal', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'four', 'films', 'most', 'visually', 'opulent', 'four', 'films', 'stunning', 'costumes', 'set', 'design', 'photographically', 'beautiful', 'quite', 'astounding', 'considering', 'was', 'shot', '16mm', 'film', ""n't"", 'age', 'very', 'well', 'Kudos', 'Criterion', 'restoring', 'well', 'performances', 'Italian', 'TV', 'films', 'were', 'mostly', 'perfunctory', 'film', 'are', 'livelier', 'more', 'interesting', 'could', 'be', 'Rossellini', 'was', 'working', 'direct', 'sound', 'something', 'never', 'did', 'Italian', 'films', 'performances', 'are', 'enriched', 'Jean', 'Marie', 'Patte', 'who', 'king', 'stiff', 'times', 'obviously', 'reading', 'cue', 'cards', 'few', 'scenes', 'Rossellini', 'gave', 'actors', 'lines', 'just', 'shot', 'had', 'cue', 'cards', 'set', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'not', 'Jean', 'Marie', 'fault', 'bit', 'distracting', ""n't"", 'detract', 'too', 'much', 'overall', 'experience', 'film.There', 'are', 'striking', 'scenes', 'film', 'one', 'end', 'film', 'garden', 'when', 'key', 'rival', 'Louis', 'arrested', 'courtoom', 'intrigue', 'absolutely', 'fascinating', 'are', 'also', 'surprising', 'parallels', 'today', 'world', 'world', 'inherited', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'also', 'fascinating', 'see', 'Louis', 'mature', 'shy', 'spoiled', 'hedonisitic', 'person', 'mature', 'solid', 'shrewd', 'politican/king.It', 'also', 'unnerving', 'see', 'doctors', 'beginning', 'film', 'tend', 'Mazarin', 'who', 'fortune', 'Louis', 'doctors', 'learned', 'men', 'time', 'bleed', 'Mazarin', 'hopes', 'healing', 'also', 'smell', 'chamber', 'pot', 'film', 'very', 'dry', 'talky', 'intellectual', 'so', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'HBO', 'series', 'occasionally', 'historically', 'accurate', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'just', 'can', 'should', 'skip', 'even', 'are', 'funny', 'scenes', 'film', 'dealing', 'sex', 'adjust', 'rhythms', 'sensibility', 'Taking', 'Power', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'absolutely', 'fascinating', 'stuff']",N/A

1204618,A12LDQSV5JEN44,B001ILTUKG,Hunter,"[0, 0]","You know how there are movies that come along that are about historical events or people and get the facts wrong, almost defiantly so.  Well, the cure for that is here in the form of The Taking of Power by Louis XIV.  A film completely immersed in historical accuracy.  Because of this we get one of the most impressive recreations of any period of time on film and one of the most boring movies ever made.The film is about Louis XIV, France's Sun King, and that is the crux of the problem.  For history nuts like myself Louis XIV is a fascinating point in history.  He is a rare example of a leader taking complete control of a country.  Every single aspect of the economy, politics, and everyday life had to go through him.  Every single decision was made solely by him.  There's a lot more to it than that; it's much more complicated but that's the basic jist of his reign.  The Taking of Power by Louis XIV shows how he took complete control and what he did with it in great detail including the building of the Palace of Versailles.  In terms of the sets, it's magnificent, but that doesn't stop the movie from being a bore.The Taking of Power by Louis XIV was directed by Roberto Rossellini, the neo-realist director who is most well known for his War Trilogy which includes Rome Open City, Paisan, and Germany Year Zero.  Here he acts more like a tour guide than a director; there is no style in this film or attitude towards Louis XIV and his reign.  He shows us these events with such an impartiality that it's almost defiantly historically accurate.The reason for the boredom is Louis XIV himself is the problem is because of how much he has been romanticized throughout time; most notably through the books of Alexandre Dumas such as The Man in the Iron Mask.  It's hard for me to look at the historical Louis XIV without my imagination being swept away to the tales of Dumas and the idea we all have about Louis XIV.  Time did more to make Louis XIV interesting than he did himself.The film starts with the death of the Cardinal Mazarin, the advisor to the King.  From there we follow Louis XIV as he tries to obtain autonomy, and take power away from the nobles and his own noble.  That's part of the problem too.  How Louis XIV took power isn't as interesting as what he did with it.  Him taking power consists mostly of a bunch of people talking and him trying to trick them out of power.  That description though does this movie too much justice and makes it sound much more exciting than it really is.  That kind of regal yet underhanded takeover would be fascinating if Louis XIV or any of the people he dealt with had any charisma at all.  The acting in the film is incredibly lifeless.  The characters are played by the costumes and not the actors.The best scenes in the movie are when we see Louis XIV really exercising his power.  The lengths he'll go to protect himself and his power are almost freighting in how much he doesn't care about others.  There is an amazing scene where we see the arrest of a noble whom Louis XIV has framed from the perspective of him looking out of his window.  We see the arrest by his royal guard but don't hear it.  It's a masterful scene in the way it removes the human elements of the arrest and showing how far Louis XIV will go to take complete power.  There is another great scene where we see an extravagant dinner after he take complete power where the invited parties come only to watch him as he eats his extravagant meal.  Because of the acting though we don't care about the arrested noble and both of these scenes become just curious fascinations than emotionally evocative.  With a better script and players these two scenes would have been masterful.I guess The Taking of Power by Louis XIV ranks highly among 1966 made-for-TV-French-historical-films but that's not very good justification to see it.  Yet why do I give it three stars out five?  I've touched on it lightly but I'll talk about it here.  The sets and costume design are so accurate and grand that it makes the movie great to look at.  To see it is as if someone went back in time with a camera and shot these events as they happened.  It was just unfortunate that Louis XIV and his pals happened to be nervous on camera and got all stilted and emotionless.  The set that struck me the most was the construction of the Palace of Versailles, talk about craftsmanship and grandeur.  None of this though makes up for how much of a bore most of the film is.",3,A Movie of Unequaled Beauty and Boredom,1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,4487,"['know', 'how', 'are', 'movies', 'come', 'are', 'historical', 'events', 'people', 'get', 'facts', 'wrong', 'almost', 'defiantly', 'so', 'Well', 'cure', 'here', 'form', 'Taking', 'Power', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'A', 'film', 'completely', 'immersed', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'get', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'recreations', 'period', 'time', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'boring', 'movies', 'ever', 'made.The', 'film', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'France', 'Sun', 'King', 'crux', 'problem', 'history', 'nuts', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'fascinating', 'point', 'history', 'rare', 'example', 'leader', 'taking', 'complete', 'control', 'country', 'single', 'aspect', 'economy', 'politics', 'everyday', 'life', 'had', 'go', 'single', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'solely', 'lot', 'more', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'basic', 'jist', 'reign', 'Taking', 'Power', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'how', 'took', 'complete', 'control', 'what', 'did', 'great', 'detail', 'including', 'building', 'Palace', 'Versailles', 'terms', 'sets', 'magnificent', ""n't"", 'stop', 'movie', 'being', 'bore.The', 'Taking', 'Power', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'was', 'directed', 'Roberto', 'Rossellini', 'neo-realist', 'director', 'who', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'War', 'Trilogy', 'Rome', 'Open', 'City', 'Paisan', 'Germany', 'Year', 'Zero', 'Here', 'more', 'tour', 'guide', 'director', 'style', 'film', 'attitude', 'towards', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'reign', 'events', 'impartiality', 'almost', 'defiantly', 'historically', 'accurate.The', 'reason', 'boredom', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'problem', 'how', 'much', 'been', 'romanticized', 'time', 'most', 'notably', 'books', 'Alexandre', 'Dumas', 'such', 'Man', 'Iron', 'Mask', 'hard', 'look', 'historical', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'imagination', 'being', 'swept', 'away', 'tales', 'Dumas', 'idea', 'have', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'Time', 'did', 'more', 'make', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'interesting', 'did', 'himself.The', 'film', 'starts', 'death', 'Cardinal', 'Mazarin', 'advisor', 'King', 'follow', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'obtain', 'autonomy', 'take', 'power', 'away', 'nobles', 'own', 'noble', 'part', 'problem', 'too', 'How', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'took', 'power', ""n't"", 'as', 'interesting', 'what', 'did', 'Him', 'taking', 'power', 'mostly', 'bunch', 'people', 'talking', 'trying', 'trick', 'power', 'description', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'justice', 'sound', 'much', 'more', 'exciting', 'really', 'kind', 'regal', 'yet', 'underhanded', 'takeover', 'would', 'be', 'fascinating', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'people', 'had', 'charisma', 'acting', 'film', 'incredibly', 'lifeless', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'costumes', 'not', 'actors.The', 'best', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'when', 'see', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'really', 'exercising', 'power', 'lengths', ""'ll"", 'go', 'protect', 'power', 'are', 'almost', 'freighting', 'how', 'much', ""n't"", 'care', 'others', 'amazing', 'scene', 'where', 'see', 'arrest', 'noble', 'whom', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'framed', 'perspective', 'looking', 'window', 'see', 'arrest', 'royal', 'guard', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'masterful', 'scene', 'way', 'human', 'elements', 'arrest', 'showing', 'how', 'far', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'will', 'go', 'take', 'complete', 'power', 'great', 'scene', 'where', 'see', 'extravagant', 'dinner', 'take', 'complete', 'power', 'where', 'invited', 'parties', 'come', 'only', 'watch', 'extravagant', 'meal', 'acting', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'arrested', 'noble', 'scenes', 'become', 'just', 'curious', 'fascinations', 'emotionally', 'evocative', 'better', 'script', 'players', 'two', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'masterful.I', 'guess', 'Taking', 'Power', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'highly', '1966', 'made-for-TV-French-historical-films', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'justification', 'see', 'why', 'do', 'give', 'three', 'five', ""'ve"", 'touched', 'lightly', ""'ll"", 'talk', 'here', 'sets', 'costume', 'design', 'are', 'so', 'accurate', 'grand', 'movie', 'great', 'look', 'see', 'someone', 'went', 'back', 'time', 'camera', 'shot', 'events', 'happened', 'was', 'just', 'unfortunate', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'pals', 'happened', 'be', 'nervous', 'camera', 'got', 'stilted', 'emotionless', 'set', 'struck', 'most', 'was', 'construction', 'Palace', 'Versailles', 'talk', 'craftsmanship', 'grandeur', 'None', 'though', 'up', 'how', 'much', 'bore', 'most', 'film']",N/A

1204620,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B001ILTUKG,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[1, 1]","If there is a downfall to this movie than I would say it is the miscast of the role for Louis XIV.  Actor picked for this role is so dull that at times feels like one is observing a marionette speaking the words.  However, (the real) Louis XIV, also known as Sun King, is one of the most imprtant rulers of France.  He came to power at the very early age and was considered by the royal court and financially influential individuals too young to run the government.  Many, inclouding his own mother and brother felt that with enough money and distractions (parties, women, hunting) he could be manipulated in becoming a puppet (king) in the hands of others.However, young Louis XIV takes his role seriously and goes to show his family, court and the rest of France that he has the power to change the history of this remarkable country and (his) dynasty.  He singlehandedly changes political system, laws and forces nobility into submission by imposing financial dependence from them on his funds.  He builds Versailles, which is one o the most magnificent palaces in the world to this day.Film shows to the intricate detail on how Louis XIV accomplished all of this in a peaceful and powerful way without causing revolt form the peasants, middle classes and nobility.  We see how cleverly he disposes of his enemies and teaches others by their example how to earn king's favor.  It is amazing that young king who assumed power at age of 22 could accomplish all of this and give king of political and cultural France glory that lasts to this day.",4,The making of the Sun King,1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,1546,"['downfall', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'miscast', 'role', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'Actor', 'picked', 'role', 'so', 'dull', 'times', 'feels', 'one', 'observing', 'marionette', 'speaking', 'words', 'However', 'real', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'also', 'known', 'Sun', 'King', 'one', 'most', 'imprtant', 'rulers', 'France', 'came', 'power', 'very', 'early', 'age', 'was', 'considered', 'royal', 'court', 'financially', 'influential', 'individuals', 'too', 'young', 'run', 'government', 'Many', 'inclouding', 'own', 'mother', 'brother', 'felt', 'enough', 'money', 'distractions', 'parties', 'women', 'hunting', 'could', 'be', 'manipulated', 'becoming', 'puppet', 'king', 'hands', 'others.However', 'young', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'role', 'seriously', 'show', 'family', 'court', 'rest', 'France', 'power', 'change', 'history', 'remarkable', 'country', 'dynasty', 'singlehandedly', 'political', 'system', 'laws', 'forces', 'nobility', 'submission', 'imposing', 'financial', 'dependence', 'funds', 'Versailles', 'one', 'o', 'most', 'magnificent', 'palaces', 'world', 'day.Film', 'intricate', 'detail', 'how', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'accomplished', 'peaceful', 'powerful', 'way', 'causing', 'revolt', 'form', 'peasants', 'middle', 'classes', 'nobility', 'see', 'how', 'cleverly', 'enemies', 'teaches', 'others', 'example', 'how', 'earn', 'king', 'favor', 'amazing', 'young', 'king', 'who', 'assumed', 'power', 'age', '22', 'could', 'accomplish', 'give', 'king', 'political', 'cultural', 'France', 'glory', 'day']",N/A
