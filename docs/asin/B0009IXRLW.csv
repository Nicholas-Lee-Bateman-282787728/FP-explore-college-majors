Denick,"[0, 0]","Just as this set advertises, it is indeed comprehensive, including a whopping eleven baseball games for those want to go back and relive the historic 2004 post season of the Bo Sox. Personally, I would never have the patience or spare time to do so, but I did enjoy skipping to the ends of the ALCS games 4-7, in which the Sox completed their dramatic and unique comeback to advance to the World Series. But there's a catch... if you want to travel back in time to witness baseball history, be prepared to do so with a presentation that is so dated, it just might hurt your eyeballs.It's hard to believe that HD was a luxury, and not a standard in 2004, but that's the way it was. As such, each of these games are presented in SD quality that can be rather grainy and blurry, when viewed on your HD set. Additionally, they appear in 4:3 aspect, as opposed to widescreen, which further hurts the presentation.

I have seen the World Series highlights DVDs, and the endless talk about the once-in-a-lifetime baseball comeback.  But I want to see it all.  Relive it all.  Not just the great pitches, or the bad breaks.  But everything.36 hours?  Who has that much time to watch these all over again?  You already know how it ends.  But Hollywood can not script drama and action of this magnitude.  Make the time.  History will remember this series (ALCS anyway) for many, many years to come.Even if you're not a Red Sox fan.  Even if you're not a baseball fan.  This series of games will speak to the heart of any sports fan.  It can not get enough attention in my opinion.And simply put, what better way to commemorate the games than just giving us everything and the kitchen sink.  Let the viewer decide on what hilights he/she wants to watch.  And no scripted bibble-babble as in the slew of DVDs that followed.  If it really is verbatim, then the commentators astoundment is real and as-it-happens.I can't wait for this set.

Its hard to spend over $100 on such a shabby product but as a die hard Red Sox fan you are compelled to turn the other cheek and shell out the money because unless you taped the games on a DVR or VCR then this is the only way your going to have some of the greatest momements in Red Sox history captured pitch for pitch.

If there's one word that can describe this set-it would be ""Awesome"" You get all seven of the ALCS against the Yankees and all four world series games angaist the Cardnials-and a bonus DVD containing a bunch of goodies.MLB spared no expense with this set.

The way the Red sox came from behind to beat the yankees 4 times in a row is a truly remarkable feat-and for a team that had bad luck after bad luck time and time again in the past. The Red sox broke the so-called curse!As for the World series, I would say that Game three was the defining game. The baserunning blunder that Cardnial pitcher Jeff Soupon made at 3rd base was a real shocker. He should have ran home to score a run-I think 2 runs could have been scored-but for some reason he ran back to third and was called out and Jeff soupon robbed the cardnials at least a run-maybe more.

906486,A3HVRZ2PPO83ZA,B0009IXRLW,Nathan P. Shive,"[0, 1]","A number of other reviews in this forum berated the poor video quality of this package and other production values.  Perhaps I have a later edition, or perhaps my standards are lower, but I have no complaints about the overall quality.  It does appear that they came from an analog master (digital broadcasts still being in their relative infancy in 2004), but compared to my VHS recordings of the same games, I have no complaints.Regarding the games themselves, my only two issues are (1) the absence of the ALDS, which to me (and many other, apparently) is inexplicable, and (2) the fact that they edited out most if not all of the pre- and post-game studio pieces, which would certainly help put each game in its context.  Fortunately, I have both these discrepancies on my own personal recordings (again, VHS, but better than nothing), so I'll probably edit together my own supplemental set.My only complaint is regarding the Bonus DVD.  The 2004 World Series Film is about the quality you'd expect from MLB, so no problem there.  The remaining features, or really featurettes, are by and large laughable.  Let's review:SCHILLING SPEAKS TO FANS -- a brief piece showing Schill taking a few questions in a fan forum at Fenway after the season, with very poor audio quality and equally poor editing, and dialogue (when audible) that really adds nothing to what we already knew.CELEBRITY FANS ON THE BIG WIN -- a brief piece showing three, unidentified, supposedly celebrity Sox fans talking about their memories from the season.  One of the individuals is Denis Leary; I have no idea who the other two are (their names are on the jacket, I later realized).  Captions might have helped.  More to the point -- are these the top 3 &#34;celebrities&#34; they could dig up?  I generally consider a &#34;celebrity&#34; somebody I'd recognize without any help.AROYO:  PITCHER BY DAY, MUSICIAN BY NIGHT -- Bronson Arroyo says a few words, walks into a studio, and we see him singing &#34;Dirty Water.&#34;  This would be worthwhile if (a) he knew the words, (b) they didn't edit out the last verse, and (c) Arroyo actually could sing.  Other than that, it was pretty good...ALCS GAME 7 POST-GAME CELEBRATION -- Interesting at first, but we've seen many of these clips in separate features already, and the editing could be a lot better.FRANCONA TAKES OVER -- Expecting a feature on how Francona was hired and his early days at the helm, maybe getting into Spring Training, we get a 2-minute sound-bite from his press conference.  That's it.  Nothing else.  Really.BEST OF ORTIZ WIRELESS -- Generally inaudible or unintelligible snippets of Big Papi throughout the season talking to other people.ALCS GAME 1:  TIMLIN & EMBREE WIRELESS -- Idle comments of two relief pitchers during batting practice.  Yawn.MILLAR SPEAKS WITH DAN SHAUGHNESSY -- Millar makes his now-famous statement &#34;don't let us win tonight&#34; prior to Game 4 of the ALCS.DAMON SHAVES BEARD -- Yippee.RED SOX VISIT THE WHITE HOUSE -- About what you'd expect, but marred by two incidents when the (single) cameraman inexplicably points his camera skyward during the President's remarks.  Nice clouds up there.WORLD SERIES LOCKER ROOM CELEBRATION -- See ALCS Game 7 postgame, above.2005 RING & BANNER CEREMONY -- This was the first one I watched, as I wanted to see if it was the same as the &#34;History Rings True&#34; DVD I already purchased.  It wasn't.  It was dreadful.  Laughably bad.  This video appears to have been shot on somebody's flip phone from the Yankees dugout.  There is no narration, just the inaudible PA announcer, and no captions, so you have no idea what's going on.  They only show some of the players, skip the most poignant moment (of Johnny Pesky getting his ring), and then show *part* of the banner raising.  Unbelievably bad.All this to say -- buy it for the games.  Even the three games they lost are worth watching (admittedly easier today as we know the final outcome) and it's a shame these losses are omitted from the 2007 and 2013 sets.  I forced myself to watch them and was glad I did, and it's good to have them on archive.

906487,ALS0041SS519N,B0009IXRLW,ROGER L. FOREMAN,"[93, 97]","Bad News First:  No games from the series against Anaheim (which were on ESPN rather than Fox), in which David Ortiz put on a hitting clinic--a one-disc overview would have been really nice.  Really nice. . . .  Thanks, ESPN, for helping out with copyright stuff. . . .  That knocks it down to 4 1/2 stars right there.  But the real drama came with the Yankees series, though, so I'll survive.  I don't have a good enough system to notice some of the more technical picture/color/resolution issues that have been mentioned, so I'm fine with that, too, even though some others have voiced valid criticisms.  That's pretty good for bad news. . . .The Good News:  Everything (and I mean everything!) is on these discs.  This set of DVDs is a spectacular collection of the most important ALCS in Red Sox history, some of the most exciting baseball to be played in October, and then the World Series, which seemed terribly anti-climactic somehow after Games 4 & 5 against the Yankees and a nice partial comeback by the Cardinals in Game 1 of the World Series.  Whatever I might be missing from the Anaheim series, I get back twofold from this set--back up to 5 stars.  Easy.The Games:  Aside from a disastrous Game 3 (which might be good to watch just to keep the comeback in even better perspective), the games were close, competitive, and dramatic.  Some pretty good drama unfolded in Games 1 & 2, despite the Red Sox losses.  Game 4 showcased a classic display of determination (by both teams) within a back-and-forth struggle, ""the steal"" by Dave Roberts, and the ultimate vintage walk-off home run by Ortiz in the bottom of the 12th inning.  Game 5 followed in those big footsteps and provided possibly even more drama, with the Red Sox tying the game in the 8th inning and the two teams playing five more scoreless innings--each team with multiple opportunities to win the game, with the dramatic finish in the bottom of the 14th.  That game went close to six hours, and we missed a great game between St. Louis and Houston, because by the time this game was over, the other game was well into the 8th inning. . . .  Games 6 & 7 seemed less ""exciting,"" simply because it seemed that the Sox had all of the momentum:  Schilling pitched great in Game 6, and Lowe pitched a one-hitter through six innings in Game 7.  Every time the Yankees made a move, the Red Sox made a bigger one in response.  All of those moments are there, however, to relive in whatever fashion you choose--watch the complete games, skip around, whatever. . . .The Setup:  The games are all there in their entirety.  However, half-inning chapter breaks make it very easy to negotiate your way through a whole bunch of baseball (Games 4 and 5 went forever. . .) in much less time than the original games took.The Packaging:  Beautiful.  Hitting statistics, pitching stats, box scores, and inning-by-inning summaries make it easy to find a particular at-bat or half-inning (some of our memories are failing, so this feature is particularly helpful. . .).  Trivia, attendance, weather info, umpires, quotes from players, pictures of memorabilia, and a host of other things are on the cover of each DVD, making it good reading material, as well.  It's all there.  All of it.  If you need a piece of information regarding these games that is not on the cases, then you need very professional help. . .The Bonus Features:  Some of us love them, and this set includes one disc devoted to just ""stuff,"" most importantly the 2005 Ring & Banner Ceremony, which was not included on any of the other World Series DVDs.  Interviews, player bios/features, trip to the White House, celebrity interviews, post-game celebrations, etc. are all included.  Complete postseason batting and pitching stats are on the inside of the case, also--Nice bonus. . . !The Price:  Can you beat it. . . ?  MLB online was offering each game, but it would have ended up costing more than this set (which I bought for less than $80 at my local Bull Moose store) and would not have had any of the nice packaging offered on this set.  I could have pictured really bare-bones discs and cases, but MLB and A&E; did a tremendous job putting together a quality package for a very reasonable amount of money.Bottom Line:  If you are a fan of baseball and, in particular, a Red Sox fan, then this set is a virtual ""must-have"" for your collection.  It is the first time that MLB has done such a project, and I hope it is successful.  Who wouldn't like to have some past great World Series and playoff series to see in their entirety?  This is an invaluable resource for future generations of Red Sox fans and for baseball fans in general--hopefully a trend has been started.  The NESN DVD (Faith Rewarded) is a great summary, with some nice local insights and perspectives.  The official MLB World Series DVD (one disc) is nice, too, if you want just a summary and a few highlights.  Neither can compare to this set, though.  Some of us want the whole enchilada, and this set provides it, with a nice salsa on the side. . . .",5,Obsessive-Compulsive Red Sox Fan Nirvana (almost. . .),1123632000,"08 10,
