1363037,A8AD6PLQ0PPQE,B003U2KEM4,"Anonymous ""booksandcookies""","[57, 84]","I am skeptical about the overwhelming highly positive reviews of this DVD. I am a long-time yoga practitioner and own a LOT of yoga DVDs. This may be the worst, is certainly among the worst, I've ever viewed and used. I did view it and use it and I do have experience and knowledge in this area. First, Mr. Israel's introductory statements about depression only dealing with the past is patently false and uninformed. Many mildly depressed as well as clincially severely depressed people are most assuredly depressed about the future and not with the kind of symptoms that anxiety brings, but with symptoms of clinical depression. How exactly would Mr. Israel make an existential absence of HOPE square with his definition of depression and the past? Second, as others have said, the sound quality of this DVD is awful. Much of the time you cannot make out what Mr. Israel - the teacher - is saying. The sound was recorded  in a large open studio with no apparent attempt to correct it after recording so that listeners, i.e. those who paid good money for this instructional DVD, could actually hear what was being said. That is so completely disrespectful of those seeking this method of help/information through ""yoga for depression and anxiety""! Third, there is absolutely NO instruction whatsoever. There is some very minimal guidance for establishing Mr. Israel's version of tadasana/mountain pose but beyond that, zilch. Early in the DVD, there is mention and one VERY brief/cursory demonstration of yogic breathing with virtually no instruction, yet breath and breathing are frequently emphasized and referred to throughout the DVD. Again, prior experience and knowledge must be presumed, yet not specified in the information given about the DVD - BEFORE purchasing! From tadasana, one is simply led directly and quickly through a rapid vinyasa sequence that is very vigorous and physically taxing. While I do think that vigorous exercise can be very beneficial for anxiety and depression, I also think that this particular sequence and its speed might be just overwhelming and defeating - not an outcome one would hope for in this area of ailment. No cautions or modifications are offered; both practitioners shown are very adept in the poses and the rigors of the repeated sequence. The female practitioner, Apryl Ryder, was wearing a full-body leotard - low cut on top with spaghetti straps but brightly colored with large patterns on the bottom part - that was a distraction from the poses shown, while Mr. Israel was wearing shorts and a tee-shirt. There was music in the background throughout. The end portion of a lengthy savasana with background music and the sound of ocean surf (as well as video images of ocean surf and setting sun - but in savasana this is pretty much lost on the practitioner who is on the floor with eyes closed!) is very nice because of the sounds and the protracted time alloted for it on the DVD. I am surprised to read Seane Corn's endorsement of this DVD but she more precisely endorses Mr. Israel's ""work"" in the quote given. Somebody should do an excellent yoga DVD on this subject because it would be of great benefit to those suffering from anxiety and depression, but this DVD is not it. I came here to sell my copy but since I paid more for it than Amazon is now offering it for and since there are many more new ones for sale through Marketplace, I will just keep it as a reminder of purchasing mistakes made based on misleading marketing and customer gullibility. Who ARE all these positive reviewers anyway? Have they really watched and used this and do they really have any experience with anxiety or depression as a sufferer or a therapist? Mr. Israel is not identified as having any psychological expertise and only as a ""certified yoga therapist"", whatever that is, and as a psychotherapist intern. Where? Under whose tutelage? With what credentials? I hope somebody will undertake the creation of a Yoga for Depression and Anxiety DVD that actually can be understood because of good acoustic/sound quality, that is respectful of those who come to it with problems they are trying to address, that provides instruction/modifications and that is paced (or at least has options) for those who might find rigor and vigorous physical exertion challenging. Maybe options with progressions of ability and energy? This DVD did not say anywhere that it was for those with highly developed yoga skills, and it should say that because it is not for beginners. Finally, there are some indications of a more personal relationship between Mr. Israel and Ms. Ryder - I think at one point (although it is very hard to understand his speech much of the time) that he calls her ""honey"" and in the liner notes he refers to her as ""the angelic Apryl Ryder"" and he gazes at her from time to time in the DVD; all of this making it seem that we viewers may be slightly intrusive in their private practice - and feeling very uncomfortable in the process. So, a plea to some excellent yoga teacher:  make another DVD on this subject. There is a need for it and it still has not been done.",1,Skeptical about reviews,1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,5120,"['am', 'skeptical', 'overwhelming', 'highly', 'positive', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'am',

1363044,AXPO46JYKP8NQ,B003U2KEM4,Ms Muffintop,"[5, 6]","Ok - first why I did not think it was as bad as some of the others thought:  yes, he films in a gym with only one ""student"". I didn't think that was bad.  Really. I liked that Ira looked like anybody.  He's wearing a t-shirt and shorts. If you check out his postures and alignment as compared to the student, he's not intimidating.  He looks like a mid-level student enjoying himself, which I thought was kind of a refreshing change from buff yoga people.  He does give a few modifications the first time he introduces each pose.  After that, he assumes you will modify on your own and he takes the harder pose i.e. up dog in lieu of cobra or jumping forward instead of stepping.There is a continuous chant going in the background. It sounded traditional.  If you have to have Bollywood music, or rock music - you won't like this.  I thought the music was nice.The girl's pants? Yes they have bright colors on them. She's not dressed any differently than people are at gyms or yoga studios - I was surprised more than one viewer found them distracting.  She's a pretty girl. Her form and alignment seem correct.Now, what I thought was not as good as some of the others thought: I agree that EXCEPT for his brief introduction, the sequence does not SEEM depression/anxiety specific.  This workout reminded me of a basic level two class at YogaWorks.  If you are not familiar with their style, it includes their own version of sun salutes for about 15 minutes of warm up, and then other poses are worked into the flow.I agree with some of the other reviewers that if you were depressed and not in great shape, this dvd might depress you more if you didn't have the strength to do the whole workout.HOWEVER, if I were to rate this video merely as a workout and NOT as depression/anxiety specific, it's not as fast as doing Ashtanga style yoga. For that, I liked it.  And if you are an advanced student who wants an at home class this would be appropriate.  How advanced? Can you do 10 sun salutes? If yes, you'll be fine.",3,"Not as bad, not as good as the reviews I have read",1333584000,"04 5, 2012",2012,2018,"['Ok', 'first', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'as', 'bad', 'others', 'thought', 'yes', 'gym', 'only', 'one', 'student', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'bad', 'Really', 'liked', 'Ira', 'looked', 'anybody', 'wearing', 't-shirt', 'shorts', 'check', 'out', 'postures', 'alignment', 'as', 'compared', 'student', 'not', 'intimidating', 'mid-level', 'student', 'enjoying', 'thought', 'was', 'kind', 'refreshing', 'change', 'buff', 'yoga', 'people', 'give', 'few', 'modifications', 'first', 'time', 'pose', 'will', 'modify', 'own', 'harder', 'pose', 'i.e', 'up', 'dog', 'lieu', 'cobra', 'jumping', 'forward', 'instead', 'stepping.There', 'continuous', 'chant', 'going', 'background', 'sounded', 'traditional', 'have', 'have', 'Bollywood', 'music', 'rock', 'music', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'thought', 'music', 'was', 'nice.The', 'girl', 'pants', 'Yes', 'have', 'bright', 'colors', 'not', 'dressed', 'differently', 'people', 'are', 'gyms', 'yoga', 'studios', 'was', 'surprised', 'more', 'one', 'viewer', 'found', 'distracting', 'pretty', 'girl', 'form', 'alignment', 'seem', 'correct.Now', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'others', 'thought', 'agree', 'EXCEPT', 'brief', 'introduction', 'sequence', 'not', 'SEEM', 'depression/anxiety', 'specific', 'workout', 'reminded', 'basic', 'level', 'two', 'class', 'YogaWorks', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'style', 'own', 'version', 'sun', 'salutes', '15', 'minutes', 'warm', 'up', 'then', 'other', 'poses', 'are', 'worked', 'flow.I', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'were', 'depressed', 'not', 'great', 'shape', 'dvd', 'might', 'depress', 'more', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'strength', 'do', 'whole', 'workout.HOWEVER', 'were', 'rate', 'video', 'merely', 'workout', 'NOT', 'depression/anxiety', 'specific', 'not', 'as', 'fast', 'doing', 'Ashtanga', 'style', 'yoga', 'liked', 'are', 'advanced', 'student', 'who', 'home', 'class', 'would', 'be', 'appropriate', 'How', 'advanced', 'Can', 'do', '10', 'sun', 'salutes', 'yes', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fine']",Yoga for Depression and Anxiety

He seems scholarly and has that therapist energy if you get my drift. :)The class is long, 75 minutes. I always feel that 75 minutes of practice feels good. It is grounding and helps me get centered.I like his pacing. He holds poses for longer than I am used to. Yet there is a flow to it. I broke a sweat.This practice is not for beginners. I think he could have a section that explains the proper alignment and ways to adjust poses to suit where you are physically and then it could be for beginners too.

Also people with neck problems need to watch it on the inverted poses.

1363047,ATCBQUONOZCE4,B003U2KEM4,"W. M. Bell ""Maegan Bell""","[46, 61]","What a waste. I was REALLY looking forward to using this DVD and thought it would be right up my alley. However, I was quite disappointed. To start, it is filmed with what appears to be a use-at-home equipment, with a lot of unsteady camera-work. As in, I think I might be able to shoot a better quality film with my phone. Ira's talking sounds quite echo-y in the room, which is understandable, because its empty - but the sound quality really suffers without any kind of buffering, it distracted me. The practice itself is not engaging at all. There's a guy giving instructions to a girl in a room, thats about it. Talk about uninspiring. If the production had been a little better, that might have worked, but it just comes off as rushed and shoddily put together.I don't understand why the thing couldn't have been shot where they got all the nice water footage from in the intro (where he's doing yoga in front of it during his talk about resentment and expectations) and the end (where you see the sun go down). Then they could have voiced-over his instructions and it would have fixed two things at once. The yoga itself is fine, basic stuff that most practitioners will be familiar with.The biggest thing I have a problem with is how does it even relate to anxiety and depression? Other than his little talk at the beginning, I don't see any connection. Even at the start he says, ALL YOGA is used to treat anxiety and depression. Therefore, it makes me think I could buy ANY yoga DVD and would be treating my anxiety and depression in the exact same way - and probably with better quality that, you know, actually makes me want to use the video. Outside of his mentioning depression/anxiety in the intro (before you are even doing actual yoga) there doesn't seem to be much else in the video that is relevant to the topic.Really, I am AMAZED at the amount of positive reviews on this. Seriously, I'm quite taken aback. The best yoga I've ever experienced was with a teacher who, throughout the practice, would always go back to the idea of being safe within yourself, loved, secure and one with the Earth. That kind of self-affirmation and connectedness with the energy pulsating through everything, while stretching and developing my bodies abilities to be a more present part of this web of life energy helped heal my constant worrying more than anything. I guess I should just start looking for a program more along those lines, if a teacher with a DVD like that exists out there... because this is not it.I'm assuming Ira would probably say my experience with the DVD was bad because I had ""expectations"" about it to begin with. Maybe its just me, but when I buy a DVD called ""Yoga for Depression and Anxiety"" I expect it to deal with these concepts, or how to address them, throughout the practice.... not just tell me:""Oh, you have depression because you resent your past, and you have anxiety because you have expectations about your future, now - lets do some yoga!""",1,Worst Yoga DVD I Own,1315008000,"09 3, 2011",2011,2983,"['What', 'waste', 'was', 'REALLY', 'looking', 'forward', 'using', 'DVD', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'However', 'was', 'quite', 'disappointed', 'start', 'filmed', 'what', 'be', 'use-at-home', 'equipment', 'lot', 'unsteady', 'camera-work', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'shoot', 'better', 'quality', 'film', 'phone', 'Ira', 'talking', 'quite', 'echo-y', 'room', 'understandable', 'empty', 'sound', 'quality', 'really', 'suffers', 'kind', 'buffering', 'distracted', 'practice', 'not', 'engaging', 'guy', 'giving', 'instructions', 'girl', 'room', 'Talk', 'uninspiring', 'production', 'had', 'been', 'little', 'better', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'just', 'off', 'rushed', 'shoddily', 'put', 'together.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'thing', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'where', 'got', 'nice', 'water', 'footage', 'intro', 'where', 'doing', 'yoga', 'front', 'talk', 'resentment', 'expectations', 'end', 'where', 'see', 'sun', 'go', 'down', 'Then', 'could', 'have', 'voiced-over', 'instructions', 'would', 'have', 'fixed', 'two', 'things', 'once', 'yoga', 'fine', 'basic', 'stuff', 'most', 'practitioners', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'with.The', 'biggest', 'thing', 'have', 'problem', 'how', 'even', 'relate', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'Other', 'little', 'talk', 'beginning', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'connection', 'Even', 'start', 'YOGA', 'used', 'treat', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'Therefore', 'think', 'could', 'buy', 'ANY', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'treating', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'exact', 'same', 'way', 'probably', 'better', 'quality', 'know', 'actually', 'want', 'use', 'video', 'mentioning', 'depression/anxiety', 'intro', 'are', 'even', 'doing', 'actual', 'yoga', 'there', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'else', 'video', 'relevant', 'topic.Really', 'am', 'AMAZED', 'amount', 'positive', 'reviews', 'Seriously', ""'m"", 'quite', 'taken', 'aback', 'best', 'yoga', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'experienced', 'was', 'teacher', 'who', 'practice', 'would', 'always', 'go', 'back', 'idea', 'being', 'safe', 'loved', 'secure', 'one', 'Earth', 'kind', 'self-affirmation', 'connectedness', 'energy', 'pulsating', 'everything', 'stretching', 'developing', 'bodies', 'abilities', 'be', 'more', 'present', 'part', 'web', 'life', 'energy', 'helped', 'heal', 'constant', 'worrying', 'more', 'anything', 'guess', 'should', 'just', 'start', 'looking', 'program', 'more', 'lines', 'teacher', 'DVD', 'out', 'there', 'not', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'Ira', 'would', 'probably', 'say', 'experience', 'DVD', 'was', 'bad', 'had', 'expectations', 'begin', 'Maybe', 'just', 'when', 'buy', 'DVD', 'called', 'Yoga', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'expect', 'deal', 'concepts', 'how', 'address', 'practice', 'not', 'just', 'tell', 'Oh', 'have', 'depression', 'resent', 'past', 'have', 'anxiety', 'have', 'expectations', 'future', 'now', 'lets', 'do', 'yoga']",Yoga for Depression and Anxiety
