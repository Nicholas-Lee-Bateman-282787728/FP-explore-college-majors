DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVENT SEEN IT!(I wont spell it out for you but I do infer events)Knowing who dies at the end, who leaves ""Seattle Grace Mercy Death Hospital"",  now that I have caught up and watched it all, is depressing and sad and seriously makes me wonder what could possible happen in Season 9 that would make me want to keep watching this show. But that said, this season may contain the last great episode ever to be filmed for the entire series.My favorite two people on this show leave, my third favorite person leaves and my top 3 otehrs are forever altered. The season 8 in its entirety is as good as any of the other top seasons like 1, 2 and 5, and has its fair share of soap opera drama. It has the token catastrophe we have come to expect from Shonda and there is enough blood and guts to keep the husbands from prying the remote from our hands but seriously, SERIOUSLY Shonda, how many more of our beloved characters must die, I mean be allowed out of their contracts before we quit watching? Eventually it will have to be changed to ""Seattle Hospital Drama - The Replacements""I have just watched the first 2 episodes of season 9 and they went nowhere near what I was expecting visually or emotionally. I am used to better from Miss Shonda. So if you love the series like I do, own all 8 seasons on dvd, even the bad ones.....a musical? Seriously? SERIOUSLY?

She just doesn't want to be a mother and Owen knew that before getting into the relationship. Speaking of Owen, cheating on Cristina to spite her was understandable but not forgivable. The whole CrOwen storyline was beautifully written and acted.Lexie... umm... nothing much to say here. She did nothing major this season but Chyler Leigh killed it in the finale with an amazing performance. Farewell, Lexie. You'll be missed.Teddy's world was turned upside down with Henry's death. We all knew it would eventually happen but it was too soon. With Henry gone, we saw Teddy grieve and take her anger out on Owen. Kim Raver too was a powerhouse this season delivering a splendid performance as the grieving widow.CalZona were not seen much this season except the Valentine's Special episode which reminded us why we love these pretty ladies and also seeing Arizona's childhood friend towards the end of the season gave us a nice insight into her past. After getting all the attention in season 7, I guess the writers decided to put them in the backseat this season, which is fair enough.Richard went through hell seeing Adele disappear right before his eyes. Adele's storyline was heartbreaking! Loretta Devine deserves another Emmy. Sadly, Adele's end is not very far. It makes one wonder though, what's left for Richard to do on the show besides play surrogate dad to Mer. A relationship with Jackson's mother would be entertaining to see.Bailey finally got the attention she deserves. Our beautiful Bailey was in the middle of a love triangle with Eli and the returning, Ben. She rightfully chose Ben who proved time and time again that he's the one for Bailey.Alex too didn't do much this season besides being a rockstar Peds surgeon and being there for Meredith whenever he could.Mark had a new love interest in Julia who was likeable but is no Lexie! Slexie's final conversation in the finale brought everyone to tears. With Lexie gone, Mark will definitely need Derek, Callie and Arizona to support him next season that is, IF he makes it alive.April struggled in her position as Chief Resident and finally failed her medical boards and got fired. I would have preferred to see her go instead of Teddy but April will be back next season.Jackson hooked up with April!!! To his dismay, April went all religious on him. He also was Mark's protege, together known as the Plastics Posse. They were extremely funny together.The finale left everyone's fate up in the air. Jackson and Alex are leaving Seattle Grace-Mercy West and April is jobless while Derek, Meredith, Mark, Cristina and Arizona are barely holding on for their life as poor Callie is waiting for Arizona to arrive and Richard is waiting for Mer and Cris at the dinner party. Bailey gets engaged to Ben but he announces he's moving across the country to be a surgical intern. Will Bailey move with him?
