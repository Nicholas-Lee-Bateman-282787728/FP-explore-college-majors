But no really, by the end of this series you better be ready with a box or else. If there is one thing I really loved about this anime it was definitely the main male protagonist. He reminded me of Rin from Shuffle! or Kyon from Haruhi Suzumiya! But he isn't the only one there are plenty of other hilarious characters in this anime. Anyway its good just like any other visual novel adaptation by Key. Yes it can funny, serious, sad, mysterious and awesome all at the same time.

Well that's a good sign.  I heard of this anime after watching and purchasing Sola, (A MUST BUY), after discovering that one of the creative minds behind the Sola anime was involved in this series.  Sola was voted anime of 2007, and many sites voted Kanon to be the anime of 2006.With the drought of quality anime this day, I was desparate to find something good to follow up Sola, and the reviews here at Amazon.com were enough to convince me to take the plunge.I have to admit, after reading the plot under various product description sources, it didn't sound as if there could be very much depth to the series, but everyone gushed over it, so I gave it a shot.I must say that despite my early concerns and pessimism, this series truly lives up to the hype.  It does start off a bit slow, but as the series continues, things progress to a whole other level.  And another, and another...  Truly worth of the series title 'Kanon'.The storytelling and pacing are truly amazing.  There are so many subtleties that I overlooked initially, that all stood out as events unfolded.Probably my new favorite anime.  The characters, the atmosphere, the story, the setting, the emotional roller coaster....

1232435,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B001R10BD2,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[1, 1]","Kanon was one of the earlier Japanese visual novels (basically a dating sim computer game) by the team that would develop Air and Clannad.  These visual novels were immensely popular and were made into manga, animated movies, and anime series.  The game was released in 1999 and this anime series was released in 2006 to 2007.  The 'Air' visual novel was released after Kanon, but the series 'Air' was developed first (2005).If you have seen Clannad, then there really isn't much to describe.  It is like Clannad light in a way.  We have the harem style anime, though in a slice of life setting.  Yuichi is a transfer student to a snowy, unnamed town.  Like in Clannad, we have many central female characters, a male sidekick of sorts, and then several supporting cast members.  The story revolves around the central male character and his interactions with the main female cast.  There is some drama, some comedy, romance, and many misunderstandings.The characters in this series seem a little less developed than those in Clannad.  But what really stands out is that the characters do seem remarkable similar to those in Clannad.  But understanding the genre, it makes sense.  You have the sporty girl, the outgoing leader type girl, the silly girl, the quiet and smart girl; you get it.  They have a 'stereotype' for every young male's ideal female type.  The other funny and notable character is the male companion who seems like he is the long lost twin of Youhei.  And while we're at it, doesn't Yuichi seem like a nearly exact copy of Tomoya?But similarity of characters aside, the series is good.  Very good.  Despite having seen Clannad and Clannad After Story recently, I was still able to appreciate and enjoy this series.  The setting works well for the mood of the story and characters.  It's not quite as richly developed as Clannad, but it definitely stands out for quality of story telling.If you haven't seen Clannad, then this might be a good series to start with.  It's much cheaper than Clannad currently.  $18 for 24 episodes is quite the deal.My personal preference is to view this series in Japanese with English subtitles.  The English dub is good, but the comedy really comes through in the Japanese.  There is just something about the inflections which you can't really put across in English.  Especially Yuichi's character and his wry sense of humor.  The Japanese voice cast is well matched with the character personalities.Buy it.  Enjoy it.  Then buy Clannad and Clannad After Story if you haven't already.",5,Kanon - the same team as Clannad and Air ~,1352246400,"11 7, 2012",2012,2536,"['Kanon', 'was', 'one', 'earlier', 'Japanese', 'visual', 'novels', 'basically', 'dating', 'sim', 'computer', 'game', 'team', 'would', 'develop', 'Air', 'Clannad', 'visual', 'novels', 'were', 'immensely', 'popular', 'were', 'made', 'manga', 'animated', 'movies', 'anime', 'series', 'game', 'was', 'released', '1999', 'anime', 'series', 'was', 'released', '2006', '2007', ""'Air"", 'visual', 'novel', 'was', 'released', 'Kanon', 'series', ""'Air"", 'was', 'developed', 'first', '2005', '.If', 'have', 'seen', 'Clannad', 'then', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'describe', 'Clannad', 'light', 'way', 'have', 'harem', 'style', 'anime', 'though', 'slice', 'life', 'setting', 'Yuichi', 'transfer', 'student', 'snowy', 'unnamed', 'town', 'Clannad', 'have', 'many', 'central', 'female', 'characters', 'male', 'sidekick', 'sorts', 'then', 'several', 'supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'story', 'central', 'male', 'character', 'interactions', 'main', 'female', 'cast', 'drama', 'comedy', 'romance', 'many', 'misunderstandings.The', 'characters', 'series', 'seem', 'little', 'less', 'developed', 'Clannad', 'what', 'really', 'out', 'characters', 'do', 'seem', 'remarkable', 'similar', 'Clannad', 'understanding', 'genre', 'sense', 'have', 'sporty', 'girl', 'outgoing', 'leader', 'type', 'girl', 'silly', 'girl', 'quiet', 'smart', 'girl', 'get', 'have', ""'stereotype"", 'young', 'male', 'ideal', 'female', 'type', 'other', 'funny', 'notable', 'character', 'male', 'companion', 'who', 'long', 'lost', 'twin', 'Youhei', ""'re"", ""n't"", 'Yuichi', 'seem', 'nearly', 'exact', 'copy', 'Tomoya', 'similarity', 'characters', 'aside', 'series', 'good', 'Very', 'good', 'having', 'seen', 'Clannad', 'Clannad', 'Story', 'recently', 'was', 'still', 'able', 'appreciate', 'enjoy', 'series', 'setting', 'well', 'mood', 'story', 'characters', 'not', 'quite', 'richly', 'developed', 'Clannad', 'definitely', 'out', 'quality', 'story', 'telling.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Clannad', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'series', 'start', 'much', 'cheaper', 'Clannad', 'currently', '18', '24', 'episodes', 'quite', 'deal.My', 'personal', 'preference', 'view', 'series', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'English', 'dub', 'good', 'comedy', 'really', 'Japanese', 'just', 'something', 'inflections', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'put', 'across', 'English', 'Especially', 'Yuichi', 'character', 'wry', 'sense', 'humor', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'cast', 'well', 'matched', 'character', 'personalities.Buy', 'Enjoy', 'Then', 'buy', 'Clannad', 'Clannad', 'Story', 'have', ""n't"", 'already']",Kanon: The Complete Series

1232438,A3JC0JWNWX2HHU,B001R10BD2,Daniel Meek,"[0, 0]","The same story writer as Air and Clannad, and visuals done by the animators who did Haruhi (the main character seems strikingly similar now that I think about it).  From what I understand of it Kanon was done first, but was a rushed production and everyone hated it, then they did Air which is of a similar genre, and then released this Kanon 2006, which was much better done, followed by Clanned (which I have not seen yet).Having seen Air it is impossible to seperate the two, and Air should be seen first as it feels like a prototype of Kanon.The title is based on Canon in D. The idea being that life has themes that largely repeat themselves over and over, but the song gains fullness and complexity as time goes on.  What started as a simple melody becomes an emotive theme full of the many gains and losses throughout the progression.The basic story is the same as Air, of a young man going around and trying to fill the voids in people's lives around him.  But in this case it quickly becomes clear that something happened 7 years ago that caused the main character much pain, which then tore him from the lives of the people around himself. The voids he has to fill are the pains he caused his childhood friends.As can be expected this is extremely melancholic (but at the same time has some great moments of comedy), and you will feel the need to find a ""I survived Kanon"" T-shirt after finishing this emotional roller coaster.  But with that said this show was captivating, and I couldn't put it down after the real story got going.  I love anime, but can only usually watch 2-3 episodes at a time (which is perhaps healthy).  This story got me going, and I watched episodes 10-24 all in one sitting.  Definitely worth owning, and also good for a re-watch (Several seemingly random still shots in the series have their meanings revealed in the end).Only 2 complaints;  1) (and this may be an encoding problem) is that walking characters looked too much like cardboard cutouts on a background.  I realize that is what they are in almost every show, but in this it was a little jarring.  2) While the soundtrack was good, it did not seem to measure up to the rest of the story.  If they ever did a 3rd remake they need to hire Yoko Kanno and let her go to town on it!Lastly, Koop has a great AMV based on this called Twilight ([...]), which is what got me interested in the show.  It contains a few spoilers, but I still found the show highly engaging because the climax is going to rip your heart out whether you see it coming or not!Once again, great story, great characters, great animation, and a solid soundtrack all adds up to a great show!

1232439,A1GW690RCZE0WL,B001R10BD2,Draconis March,"[2, 3]","It's extremely difficult to review this without nearly copy-pasting sections of my review of Air (especially since I saw them so close together), but I'll do my best.Key/Visual Arts is here with another masterpiece.  Great characters, great animation, magical story, top-notch musical score, heavy emotional involvement.This time, in Kanon, they've really outdone themselves as far as dialogue goes.  Pay close attention, or you might miss something important:  There's almost always more than one level of meaning.  Metaphors, aesops, and foreshadowing abound in simple lines you'd never suspect of such.  Even when there isn't anything more to be read into the dialogue, you can still expect it to be magical.  The English VAs are phenomenal--as you may expect--especially Chris Patton (Yuichi) and Brittney Karbowski (Ayu).  Everyone else is great as well; these two just stand out.The characters are unique, sympathetic, relatable, and each beautiful in their own way.  Great effort was obviously put in to give them such depth.  Many have their own little quirks that make their personality easy to like.  You get attached to the characters easily and care about what happens to them.The story is a little slow right at the beginning, but once you get sucked in, you get HOOKED.  The supernatural elements are very interesting.  And the way it all comes together...  It's really clean, innocent, nonviolent (mostly; what little there is isn't a big deal and only helps tell the story)--good for the whole family.The visuals aren't as clear and crisp as other Kyoto Animation works (Air, Clannad, Angel Beats!), but is still well above average.  The night scenes in the city are the best, IMO.  The water fountain is REALLY stunning; the falling snow is pure, reminiscent bliss.  The coloring is great and realistic, but somehow surreal at the same time.  It's hard to describe, really.  Maybe it's the lighting or something...The music is really good as usual.  There are lots of slow, melodic tunes to fill the course of the series.  Someone else already pointed out the connection between canon (as a musical device), the theme of the series, and the name of the series itself.  I am particularly fond of ""Kaze no Todoritsuko Basho"" (the outro song).  However, I myself feel that the intro and outro songs should've been switched.  Up until the last episode, I felt the moods would've been more appropriate that way.  But maybe this wouldn't have been for the best, because of how the outro song is used at the final curtain call at the end of the series.On that note, without giving anything away, I can definitively say that the end of this series is the most heartwarming in any series I've seen.  It made me happy in ways words can't begin to describe.  Very satisfying conclusion.  It made me appreciate ""Kaze no Todoritsuko Basho"" much more.*** SPOILER WARNING:  This paragraph contains a little spoiler.  If you don't want to read a spoiler, skip to the next paragraph ***  The only thing about the ending that was disappointing to many was how Nayuki wasn't shown to be definitively happy at the end.  They felt the need for there to be a little bit more closure on her end.Any person with half a brain would find it impossible to give this series a 1 star review.  When you read the lonely 1-star here on Amazon, it's obvious that she has no idea what she's talking about.  The writing is beautiful.  It's impossible NOT to care about the characters.  If you don't, the problem isn't the show: it's you.  Saying they're obnoxious couldn't be any farther from the truth.  When Yuichi is mean to these girls, it's usually just to tease, and they take it too seriously.  And besides, if he didn't do that, he'd be perfect.  And we all know perfect people don't exist.  And the dialogue is easily one of the strongest aspects of the series.If she were as experienced in anime as she claims to be, she'd know that you should ALWAYS expect the unexpected.  It didn't take long for me to figure out that you can't jump into a series with expectations that, if left unfulfilled, leave you disappointed (like it being ""reality-rooted"").  That's simply illogical and unreasonable--you're only setting yourself up for failure.  In fact, whenever I'm considering series to watch, I avoid reading information about it as much as possible JUST so I don't have expectations to be let down.  (Also because I like being surprised.)  The supernatural elements are what really made Kanon the beautiful masterpiece it is.  There wouldn't be a story without them (or maybe there could be, but it would be boring as hell).ANYWAY, the moral of the story is: buy Kanon.  Unbeatable price for 24 episodes of one of the most beautiful series to grace the world of anime.  I guarantee you'll want to watch it more than once.",5,Do YOU believe in miracles?,1315180800,"09 5, 2011",2011,4813,"['extremely', 'difficult', 'review', 'nearly', 'copy-pasting', 'sections',

I had the individual discs 1 - 4 & 6 from Funimation  but missed #5. Having now watched the Complete Series, there is no way I could have watched what I had and gotten any sense of it or any real enjoyment. Coronation St this isn't in that a chunk of programs can be skipped and you pick up the story ok.What you don't get in this collection are the 8 episodes of 'A Close Look at an Anime Production House' that cover the steps of making anime.The story is set during a long northern winter, and this, along with appropriate music (inc Pachelbels' Canon) really suits the tone of the show.The story is quite engrossing and has an element of mystery about it that stays just out of reach - a dangling carrot so to speak. The character designs have been criticized as being too similar, but not by me! This is anime & they look just fine. Each main character has a back story which gets explored and indeed, none of the characters seem superficial or superfluous. The standard of art is consistently high.It may help to understand that the show is the second of three (so far) anime that have been based on video games produced by Key (1st being Air TV, then this, next Clannad) and this influences the structure of the story whereby the main male character deals with each main female in turn. I initially felt that once a girls story was done, she was neatly put away, but upon reflection there were references back to each as necessary.There are some quite emotional moments and some that could make you look away.I was left feeling that this is a very good show and I must watch it again to pick up on the details and fill in the gaps.

However ""Rumbling Hearts"" and ""Kanon"" are the exceptions.As far as animation goes it is above average as a whole. Watching the snow fall is just outstanding...coloring is great. Voices are very well done and for the price you can not beat it.Sometimes we experience things that are to tramatic for us and the mind blocks them out rather than deal with them. Hence the premises of the show. As a boy he spent time there but now returning as a high school student he sees familiar places but can not place them or some of the people.Story progresses nicely and as it does things begin to unfold. Yet there is a light hearted feel to it and for me it was the blend of comedy - tragedy and scenic settings that made this really stand out. It has a slight supernatural hint to it so it is not truly real life but the pain that one has to deal with is.As far as the box itself goes there is just a sticker on it that says ""SAVE"" so it looks fine when you remove it.

1232449,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B001R10BD2,maskedgamer,"[3, 12]","It's an okay anime. Done in the same artistic and melodic style of Cl'annad. Though for some reason I always feel like these animes were written by M.Night. Shyamalan. They all seem to be done in his odd story telling style. I checked out Kanon after watching Cl'annad. Much to say I think this one would of been better to watch before Cl'annad because it would have seemed ""fresh"". For the most part the works I've seen put out by ""KEY"" always have the same style of story telling. Meet a mysterious person, get to know them, drama happens, and wash rinse and repeat. This series is really no different from that basic format they use. The art and the music score is nice (why do the women in their animes shows have such large eyes?).Those are bonus points though that keep you interested and as always really helps establish the characters expressions and feelings. I don't think the anime would come across with the same impact if it weren't animated so well. Though a visual novel leaves your mind to paint the picture animation is a bit different. Poor animation makes people not take the story so seriously but they did a great job here.My biggest problem really was the story. The one thing I think KEY could really work on (and maybe something is lost in translation form the visual novels)is the relationship development. Essentially these animes are about building bonds and relationships. In Clannad the main character falls for a girl and ends up making a commitment to her but you never see them even kiss once. You honestly never get to see a ""romantic"" relationship grow between them. Their conversations and interactions are the same as with the other female characters. So when the main character decides to chose one girl out the bunch to claim as his love interests you're asking yourself ""How?"" and notably she's usually the least attractive looking one(in my opinion).In Kanon they spend more time explaining the female characters and their stories. This was much better as they didn't do this really in Cl'annad. Outside of 1 story arc that I remember. In Kanon they explain all of the girls and their relationship to the main character (well his cousin gets kind of skimped over). The biggest problem with this series is that the main character seems to be more romantically capable with the other girls like Shiori and Mai because of how close he comes to them in their story arcs but when he chooses his love interests it doesn't make any since since it appears as though he had better chemistry with them than his overall choice. It really feels random and it's hard to connect even though it's explained the romance part is just never there so it feels forced.I guess the only way I can explain it is like having the main character fall for a side character instead of another main character that has more screen time. His choice seemed more like a better ""friend"" than a romantic interest. That's the biggest flaw I see in the work of these types of animes. It leaves a lot of folks scratching their heads at certain points.Overall with the lack of ""romantic relationship development"" the story was still interesting. 3/5 because the story just didn't move me like they wanted it to. Too much predictable drama and the usual format. In the end I'm confused still as of to who he chose to be with? His cousin or the his long lost friend? Like I said the relationship development in this one is really off.P.S. if it was me I would have chosen Akiko.

Now that Funimation has acquired the rights to bring both of these (already similar) shows out just one week apart will likely do little to differentiate one from the other.  Having just watched the two series literally back to back, I can attest to the fact that Kanon succeeds in many areas where Air comes short.  Yes there are some similarities between the two that will warrant direct comparison throughout my review but in actuality, Kanon is certainly more emotionally taxing in its prose and scope.  Well before I get ahead of myself here, let's start at the beginning, shall we?Released across 4 discs, Funimation is packaging up TBS Animation's Kanon in a complete series box set.  The packaging is quite appropriate if slightly mysterious in its rear panel summary.  Inside is a pair of beautifully artistic thin packs, each of which contains two discs.  The choice of whites and pale blues is subtly appropriate for the oft-snowy setting of the story itself.  I may even go on record as saying that the thin pack exterior art is the finest Funimation has released to date.  In all the show runs 576 minutes and earns a fairly conservative TV PG rating (no nudity, language, or violence to speak of).The set, as has been the trend of late, contains virtually no extras to speak of although the language options are thorough (English dub and original Japanese with or without English subtitles).With stories like this that play out literally as emotionally driven mysteries, I feel it's critical that I don't provide any spoilers while attempting to summarize the plot here.  That said, the story follows a high-school age young man who comes to stay with his aunt and female cousin after a seven-year hiatus.  The viewer is treated to the same laid back pacing that Air relished and Kanon even operates off the sometimes-monotonous rhythm of daily routine.  Where Kanon succeeds over Air is through the use of witty dialog that actually manages to be funny.  The lead character (Yuichi) has many genuine moments of interaction, especially early on when the massive cast is being established.Interestingly enough, save for one other male, the cast is entirely female.  It sounds suspicious but manages to work surprisingly well.  Much of the story plays off the fact that Yuichi basically comes back to town with amnesia of his previous visit (which was just over summer vacation seven years prior).  The viewer is along for the unveiling of the facts right along side the lead character through frequent flashbacks that shed a bit of light present situations.I won't sugarcoat the reality that this isn't a show for the overly sensitive as heartbreaks and a near endless succession of tragedies abounds.  However, if I can offer any insight without taking away from the show's charm it would be to hold off on passing judgment until you've followed it all the way through to completion.  Many of the show's mysteries and seeming impossibilities don't start making sense until the final couple episodes.  In fact, the bigger picture isn't fully realized until the last section of the final episode!Like such classic films as the Sixth Sense, Kanon is setup with clues and hints all along the way that cannot be fully appreciated until the second or third time through.  Just prepare for a few of those ""how could I have not realized this the first time"" moments.The show's art is simply flawless throughout.  Landscapes, textures, lighting, and ambiance are truly second to none.  Much of the show takes place over the course of a winter but don't for a minute suspect this left the artists with a pallet of drab grays and whites.  Truthfully, the sunsets, snowfalls, crunching sound of boots and steamy clouds of exhalation just dazzle consistently throughout.Additionally there are many that attempt but few shows that succeed in so charmingly capturing mood.  Acting work, especially in the English dub, is outstanding.  This is especially admirable considering that such a large cast of similarly aged females surely required unique performances for distinction.  I should mention that a few characters do sound a lot alike but in the end the choice was most certainly deliberate.With each of my reviews I like to attempt to nail down a single attribute that could be the show's greatest strength.  With Kanon I may have to bend my own rule on account of the fact that so many aspects come off so well.  I was initially leaning toward character development as, in this case, it is detrimental in moving the story along.  Here we have a cast of characters that is near impossible not to adore for their sincerity, innocence, sense of humor, and in many cases, realistic interaction with each other.  Coupled to the stunning visuals and solid voice work, it's tough to praise one aspect over the others.In all, I won't kid you into thinking Kanon won't be difficult to market to the domestic general public.  Upon first impression of the cover art, I feared a tale leaning toward the female-set what with the five glassy-eyed girls and pink lettering and all.  However, and much like Air, this is a show with an abundance of heart and enough intriguing elements along the way to soften up even the hardest viewer.  It's a story that transcends fads, styles, cultures and even defies genres come to think of it.  We simply have nothing like this in the United States for a direct comparison and I'm certain that accounts for a lot of its charm.  It's definitely not for everyone on account of the fact that what it lacks in action sequences is made up for with the viewer's ability to connect with the cast.Take even the name Kanon for example- it is cleverly explained in one scene to have been inspired by the musical definition (canon) whereby a composition consists of a single melody repeated over and over with the addition of more elements each time.  In a way I cannot think of a more appropriate metaphor for the show itself in its portrayal of life as being essentially the same day lived over and over with the addition of new experiences layered atop the familiarity of our routines.Shows like this are successful not for their ability to focus on one aspect of the human condition but rather because they manage to grab hold of all of the little things that define humanity then put those elements together across a pace at which nearly anyone can relate.  Kanon is more of an experience, a chance to briefly live among someone else's creative vision than it is simply entertainment.  Kanon is truly timeless storytelling in the strictest sense of the word.",4,Timeless Anime Storytelling,1240704000,"04 26, 2009",2009,6682,"['almost', 'impossible', 'find', 'reviews', 'Kanon',

1232458,A3HZ2D336K7QSY,B001R10BD2,"Scott Martin Gavin ""yukicat1""","[6, 7]","This anime series is almost as sad as ""Grave of the Fireflies"". It's a very odd series with a very complex story line that, like a musical canon (Kanon) repeats the same theme but adding more detail and texture to create a beautiful and touching story. This is especially odd, because Kanon started out life as a ""ero"" (adult) game in Japan. It then saw life as cleaned-up G rated games on the Saturn and the Playstation game systems and was popular enough that it was made into a 13 episode anime series, followed by an OVA. The art on this original series was barely better than the game graphics, and, fortunately, Kanon was later remade into a 24 episode anime series with nearly state of the art graphics and very nice sound track. Pachabel's Canon in D even is used as background music in a few scenes.Kanon is a series about relationships, and nearly everybody the hero, Yoichi, meets has a tragic backstory. These sad stories are all interwoven around a mysterious tragedy that occurred when Yoichi was a boy that was so traumatic that he chose to lose his memory of past events. At times the series hovers on the border of becoming a Harem series as the hero meets and befriends one girl after another. There is his pretty, air-headed cousin, Miyuki, who faces a crisis near the end of the story after a tragic traffic accident. There is the foxy Madoka, who has lost her memory and can only remember that she has a grudge against Yoichi. There is the weird Ayu, a tomboyish girl who lost her mother as a child and is fond of swiping food from street vendors. There is Mai, the demon huntress, who has strong supernatural powers. There is Saiyuri, the first year student with a terminal disease. As Yoichi helps each girl come to grips with the tragedy in their own lives, he eventually begins to remember the tragedy in his own past. Overlaying it all are the dreams and memories of one of the girls who cannot wake up from the dreams that have consumed her soul. The identity of the dreamer is kept secret for the first half of the series. Several of the stories choked me up, but poor Madoka's story brought me to tears. There seems to be an odd undercurrent of supernatural events behind the intertwining stories.The story is complex and holds up to repeated viewing, in fact, repeated viewing is necessary to catch all the subtle hints. On first viewing I didn't understand if the ending was a delusion on the part of the Dreamer, a delusion on the part of Yoichi, or if the whole story was a delusion on Yoichi's part with only the ending being real. I had to watch it a second time before the Dream sequences made sense and explained the story line. The anime is deliciously crafted. Hints to later events are hidden in the earlier episode, hints that may not make sense until the story is viewed a second time: hints like the strange look Saiyuri's doctor gives to Ayu when they meet up in the hospital, or the silhouette of a tree that features prominently in the opening credits. There are also some strange goings on that are so subtle that they can be missed. When the hero encounters the Dreamer in the last episode, she is holding a doll that had vanished in the haunted forest when Yoichi returned it to what appeared to be a ghost of the Dreamer, who Yoichi believed to be dead.Although the anime is based on an old adult game, the anime series is completely innocent. There is no nudity and only a few sweet kisses. And, at risk of giving too much away, considering how much tragedy the anime series contains, the story actually comes to a happy ending.The art is beautiful, the story wonderful, leaving me disappointed in only one regard: only Madoka's story - which I thought was the saddest of all the stories - doesn't have a happy ending. This anime series is a great one to use to introduce a loved one to anime.

1232459,A94NOJCJCI6PB,B001R10BD2,Sean,"[0, 0]","In a city called Amnesia. Wait, sorry, that's not it. In a city where the main character has terrible amnesia, everyone is prone to sickness and accident, and echoes of better things to come echo resoundingly (namely, Clannad), there's a guy named Yuuichi. He's moved in with his aunt, as he did seven years previously. His memories of that winter break are really hazy, borderline Elfen Lied syndrome. But he met a lot of people and affected a lot of lives in that break, and his return is the culmination of what he started seven years before. This is set off by the perky and cute Ayu, a girl he knows, but doesn't know. This continues with a chance meeting with a mischievous girl named Makoto and continues from there.Kanon has the same set up as Clannad in that Yuuichi meets a host of girls who have some problems that he attempts to quell. The romantic interest is hard to guess because he seems so close to so many girls, but in the end there is one constant girl who he winds up with. A lot of the same elements as Clannad come up as well, especially prevalent being the supernatural aspect and the coma. Of course, this is the precursor to Clannad and should be treated as such now that we can look back at it. While it has a lot of failings, it is the start.Kanon's story isn't great, but it's not bad. The problem with the story is how forced the depressing parts seem. I don't  know how many times the series tries to make me feel bad for characters by having their parents or themselves come down with unnameable diseases. The first time it was boring and cheap, the fourth time it was stupid. The series doesn't leave many characters without scarring and while I can commend it for having balls, I can't commend it for continually forcing me to watch scene after scene of shocked and sad characters after finding out their friends or family have been hurt or come down with disease. There are certain points where you will have a shocked expression sitting on your face because a  bad thing comes out of left field. though, and these are the most effective.Makoto, Mai, and Shiori's sections of the story are all decently done, but none of it really stands out. The gradual progression of the disappearance of Makoto is nicely done and may be the only subtle part of the series. You know what's going to happen, and you feel for Makoto. Mai is different in the fact that none of what she does is really dramatic, I felt like I was watching a supernatural high school action anime instead of a drama. The part about her mother was groan-worthy, especially because it was the second sickness in the series. The drama came more so at the end of this storyline, and was fairly stupid in my opinion. Shiori's section, for me, was pretty archetypical and boring. It made nice progress character development-wise, but was otherwise nothing exciting and brought up the fourth instance of sickness (the third being Aunt Akiko). And then more happens to Aunt Akiko and this was one of the few moments I was left with my jaw dropped. As I said, it came out of nowhere and it hurt pretty bad.Where the story is good is with the final section, dedicated to Ayu. As I watched it, I felt like I was watching Tomoya and Fuko from Clannad getting together. I was seeing characters I already know. And I was so happy too. I knew what was coming, but it was still emotionally riveting and dramatic to watch this storyline unfold, and an especially happy moment at the end. I felt that the romance between Ayu and Yuuichi was a little rushed, and he didn't seem as into her as he did Shiori or the other girls, but nonetheless it was still heartfelt.The series as a whole can be considered forced drama, but there are moments that are seriously heartfelt and well done. And a lot of the good drama comes from the excellent cast of characters.The characters are really moe, but that's okay. The personalities are all different, and while some are archetypical, some are a little different. Each character develops and grows on you, even Yuuichi, which I find commendable. Usually the main male character is someone you could give a ***** less about, a piece of cardboard being thrown around and rejecting any advances while simultaneously being an ***** to everyone he meets. Yuuichi is the opposite. While he is a snarky and sarcastic guy, he is, at heart, good. He does everything he can to help these girls and the fact that he cries over one of them just goes to show how different he is from the rest. He just knows the right way to deal with everything, and while his seeming amnesia is a nuisance (though part of that is explained later on) he's overall the best character in the entire show.Oh, and Jun is Sunohara.Why bring all this stuff about Clannad up? Because if you liked Clannad, you'll love Kanon. If you loved Kanon, you'll love Clannad. There are a lot of similarities, especially in the style of how the show progresses, but both provide great drama and great characters.In Kanon there's only that one problem of forced drama, though; the fact that bad things are prone to happen to everyone. And while the happy ending is nice, you spend the entire show feeling like you're being made to cry or feel bad. As stated, there are points where things work and painful scenes are painful and there are points where it's boring.Despite all the issues, it's still a thoroughly enjoyable anime. I laughed, I cried, I met new friends and found myself meeting old ones in different bodies. Never is it bad, it just never hits the stride that Clannad eventually will.If you're looking for drama and characters you'll grow to love, then give Kanon a shot.",4,An Excellent Anime,1372636800,"07

I was hesitant at first, just because the way the eyes looked on the girls. But when your watching it, all that goes away after a while.. and then they look more cute then creepy. (thats me anyways). The story is a bit slow going, but does make its point as it goes along. As in...the story gets clearer and clearer. It does have a few funny moments or parts. But you have too pay attention in order to catch them.(like mokoto when she gets her leg caught in between the door..or when yuichi drops..what looks like a bar soap or something ...down mokoto's shirt.( SO TRY NOT TO TXT SO MUCH TEENS ;) OR YOU'll Miss IT) And yes it does have it's sad moments as well. So like iv seen in another review....if you do get emotional...have those tissues handy. And as far as the ending....i did like how it ended. The only thing i didnt like...was really..what had happend to one of the characters. She didnt die or nothing, but i would have liked a better outcome of what happend too her. But yea...

Afterwards, I bought this edition of the series. If someone had tried to describe this series to me before I viewed it, I probably wouldn't have wanted to watch it. I have a great appreciation for Japanese animation and have watched a lot of it. I would certainly rank this with the very best. What initially piqued my curiosity was reading somewhere that this series was very popular in Japan. When I read that I decided I should check it out. I had no idea what it was about. After watching the episodes on the first disk, I still had no idea where the story could be going. In fact, the story seemed quite weak. But the character development, largely thanks to the superb Japanese voice-acting, was wonderful. The first third of the series is an introduction, an overture, in which we get to know something of the personalities of the various characters. In hindsight, it's also the time when the hook is being masterfully set. Following this, the first ""minor"" theme is developed and concluded, and then there's no going back. If you're intrigued by this vague description, I would recommend that you watch the series without any research beforehand, and with the Japanese language/English subtitle options chosen.

1232465,A1JEHPPJ4475HP,B001R10BD2,W. Watson,"[141, 151]","I've been watching Anime now for a while. Basically I got started because my daughter wanted something else to watch after Teen Titans stopped making new episodes. I like the idea of having cartoons that aren't brainless or devoid of feeling. I have bought a lot that we watch together, but some of the Anime with more complex storylines I thought might be beyond her (She's 10), but she surprised me with getting a lot more about the stories than I would have thought. We watched Shuffle together and she will frequently sit down with me and ask to watch it again. So I started looking for some similar titles and I happened upon Kanon.Parents:There is absolutely no fan service in this Anime. (Fan Service means scantily clad scenes put into the show for no other reason than exciting pubescent boys) This is what's called a Shojo Anime, or an anime that is meant for young to teen aged girls, and it shows. Kanon relies more on imagery, storytelling, and dialog to move the story along. No one gets beat up. There is one scene with a hint of blood, but I assure you it's not unnecessary -- it comes as a vital part of the story. I didn't detect any cursing and the situations are not ludicrous. If you're looking for something more actiony, then this is not the title for you.There's a reason it's called Kanon. It's fully explained within the series but it's a subtle explanation. It's a play on the musical term of a canon. Think row,row, row your boat --it's a repeating melody that gets more complex as you pass each repetition. This happens in the story as well. It's about Yuichi, who had come back to live with his Aunt Akikko and his Cousin Nayuki after 7 years. Yuichi discovers that he has no memory of his last visit 7 years ago. Through his interaction with the other characters in the story, Yuichi begins to remember what he repressed, and eventually why he repressed it. Most of the girls that he interact with knew him from before in one way or another. Along the way, Yuichi encounters Ayu, a short girl with a winged backpack. She's bubbly and kind, and despite his sarcastic view of things, Yuichi is smitten with her. She remembers him from before and soon Yuichi is set down a path of discovery that will lead him through a lot of personal heartache. As he rediscovers each set of memories, the richness and fullness of his life there becomes apparent.Unlike a lot of other Anime, this one has an ending that does bring the story to a definite conclusion. It's not a harem comedy --though Yuichi has strong feelings for his friends, he's not conflicted in the slightest about them. So if you're looking for that, you're really going to be disappointed. I bought this one because I wanted to make sure that I had some new ones for my daughter, but I don't know if she'll take to this one. It's basically a slice of life style of anime and there are funny moments but it isn't a comedy. There were definitely a couple of times that I did tear up, and I found the ending to be especially satisfying. I think that there really isn't anything bad that I have to say about this anime. I think parents may find this enjoyable to sit down and watch with their kids.",5,"I bought this one for myself, actually...",1275523200,"06 3, 2010",2010,3181,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'Anime', 'now', 'while', 'Basically', 'got', 'started', 'daughter', 'wanted', 'something', 'else', 'watch', 'Teen', 'Titans', 'stopped', 'making', 'new', 'episodes', 'like', 'idea', 'having', 'cartoons', 'are', ""n't"", 'brainless', 'devoid', 'feeling', 'have', 'bought', 'lot', 'watch', 'together', 'Anime', 'more', 'complex', 'storylines', 'thought', 'might', 'be', '10', 'surprised', 'getting', 'lot', 'more', 'stories', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'watched', 'Shuffle', 'together', 'will', 'frequently', 'sit', 'down', 'ask', 'watch', 'again', 'started', 'looking', 'similar', 'titles', 'happened', 'Kanon.Parents', 'absolutely', 'fan', 'service', 'Anime', 'Fan', 'Service', 'scantily', 'clad', 'scenes', 'put', 'show', 'other', 'reason', 'exciting', 'pubescent', 'boys', 'what', 'called', 'Shojo', 'Anime', 'anime', 'meant', 'young', 'teen', 'aged', 'girls', 'Kanon', 'more', 'imagery', 'storytelling', 'dialog', 'move', 'story', 'one', 'up', 'one', 'scene', 'hint', 'blood', 'assure', 'not', 'unnecessary', 'vital', 'part', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'detect', 'cursing', 'situations', 'are', 'not', 'ludicrous', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'more', 'actiony', 'then', 'not', 'title', 'you.There', 'reason', 'called', 'Kanon', 'fully', 'explained', 'series', 'subtle', 'explanation', 'play', 'musical', 'term', 'canon', 'Think', 'row', 'row', 'row', 'boat', 'repeating', 'melody', 'more', 'complex', 'pass', 'repetition', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'Yuichi', 'who', 'had', 'come', 'back', 'live', 'Aunt', 'Akikko', 'Cousin', 'Nayuki', '7', 'years', 'discovers', 'memory', 'last', 'visit', '7', 'years', 'ago', 'interaction', 'other', 'characters', 'story', 'Yuichi', 'remember', 'what', 'repressed', 'eventually', 'why', 'repressed', 'Most', 'girls', 'interact', 'knew', 'one', 'way', 'way', 'Yuichi', 'Ayu', 'short', 'girl', 'winged', 'backpack', 'bubbly', 'kind', 'sarcastic', 'view', 'things', 'Yuichi', 'smitten', 'soon', 'Yuichi', 'set', 'down', 'path', 'discovery', 'will', 'lead', 'lot', 'personal', 'heartache', 'set', 'memories', 'richness', 'fullness', 'life', 'lot', 'other', 'Anime', 'one', 'ending', 'bring', 'story', 'definite', 'conclusion', 'not', 'harem', 'comedy', 'Yuichi', 'strong', 'feelings', 'friends', 'not', 'conflicted', 'slightest', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', ""'re"", 'really', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'bought', 'one', 'wanted', 'make', 'sure', 'had', 'new', 'ones', 'daughter', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ll"", 'take', 'one', 'basically', 'slice', 'life', 'style', 'anime', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'were', 'definitely', 'couple', 'times', 'did', 'tear', 'up', 'found', 'ending', 'be', 'especially', 'satisfying', 'think', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'bad', 'have', 'say', 'anime', 'think', 'parents', 'may', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'kids']",Kanon: The Complete Series

The artists and writers did a good job of developing story and characters. the color scheme showed the different moods of the story and characters as the story raced toward the finish line. Each character had a purpose in helping the lead character to grow and mature for the unique ending to this anime. Everything seemed to blend together seamlessly to make the viewer feel the woes of the main character and other characters that impacted the story in this anime. Thank you. Like an Eternal Journey of the Heart. Everything has purpose even though we do not know the purpose of that one small event or a memory maybe until later in our journey through life.
