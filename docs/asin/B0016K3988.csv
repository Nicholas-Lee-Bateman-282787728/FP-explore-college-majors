1153560,AQ990HW13DP08,B0016K3988,Daniel B. Clendenin,"[12, 12]","Writer and director Reha Erdem situates his film in a mountainous Turkish village to explore the rhythms of nature and multi-generational family strife. He tells the story from the perspective of three adolescent classmates. Omer hates his imam father; he dreams, prays, and plans how he might die. His best friend Yakup is infatuated with the school teacher and enraged when he catches his own father leering at her through a window. Yildiz slaves away like all the women in this movie, cooking, cleaning, and caring for her baby brother. All the themes of adolescent coming of age emerge here -- birth and death, sex and shame, guilt and longing, fear and confusion, oedipal love and male violence, nationalism and religion. The imperatives of nature surround everyone, with spectacular scenes of mountains and sea, wind and rain, a cloudy moon and a solar eclipse, animals mating, birthing, and being butchered. Erdem organizes the film around Islam's five calls to prayer, but in reverse order as if to accentuate the disorientation of adolescence: night, evening, afternoon, noon, and morning.

It is a work from Turkey of rare beauty visually, musically, and natural grandeur. Writer/director Reha Erdem is a poet as well as an accomplished filmmaker.Three young children are approaching the torrents of adolescence, each carrying emotional scars and family histories that will forever alter the way they reach adulthood.  Omer (Ozkan Ozen) is the son of the local imam who climbs the minaret five times a day to chant the call to prayer: Omer's younger, smarter brother is favored by the father and Omer copes with the loathing for his father  by planning his death.  Yakup (Ali Bey Kayali), Omer's closest friend, has a crush on his teacher (Selma Erge) but is deeply disillusioned when he spies on his own father (whom he has always defended against his grandfather's abuse) attempting to court his teacher. Yildiz (Elit Iscan) is a girl under-appreciated by her mother and is stunned to overhear her parents coupling.  The three children attempt to engage in a normal childhood, reacting tot he beauty of the natural surroundings of their poor little village to the point of learning animal husbandry first hand! They befriend another young orphan Davut (Tarik Sonmez), the town shepherd, when he sustains physical abuse from his guardian.  The sensitivity of the children's reflections of their parents' maladaptive behavior creates a bond that sustains their daily trials.There is not a lot of narrative here, but the sensory pleasures of the film are immense.  Divided into sections labeled Night, Evening, Afternoon, Noon and Morning, the film follows the marriage of the calls to worship that clock the lives of these people with the atmospheric cinematography by Florent Herry and embellished by the sumptuous musical score by Arvo P&auml;rt.  It is a long film (just short of two hours) that takes its time to unfold the mysteries of coming of age and it is a film that will haunt the viewer long after the credits have ceased.

1153562,A27L60JENYODDV,B0016K3988,Harvey Woodmeadow,"[0, 0]","This is a beautifully produced film. The cinematography, the music, the acting, along with the spectacular scenery of this hillside village overlooking the sea, all provide a visual and aural feast.Unfortunately, as a westerner I found myself wondering if I'd understand the film better with some help. Granted, there are definitely some elements to the film that are almost certainly meant as artistic rather than literal, including the occasional unseen horse whinnying (I never did see a horse in the film...just a lot of goats) and numerous moments showing one of the children lying asleep on the ground somewhere (on the rocks, in the hay, in the shrubs, etc.).But other aspects, such as the relative lack of progress (a baby is born, and two brothers build a wall, but mostly other than that each person seems to be just living the same routine day after day), and the general malaise that seems to have befallen the village (while the children occasionally laugh at something they find amusing, the birth is the one moment in the entire movie when someone seems to be experiencing a genuinely joyful moment), I can't tell if these are meant also to be part of the art of the film or truly reflective of life in a village like this.Likewise, the relationships between nearly every person in the film seems to be indifferent at best, and in most of the close ones, there's at least an undercurrent of abuse, if not an outright expression of it.I found the whole experience very sad. But the fact is, if a film is supposed to be an expression, drawing the viewer in emotionally, this one succeeds. It was a treat to watch and while I may not have understood it well enough to really &#34;get it&#34;, I did not at all regret the nearly two hours spent with it.",3,Guide needed,1390608000,"01 25, 2014",2014,1764,"['beautifully', 'produced', 'film', 'cinematography', 'music', 'acting', 'spectacular', 'scenery', 'hillside', 'village', 'overlooking', 'sea', 'provide', 'visual', 'aural', 'feast.Unfortunately', 'westerner', 'found', 'wondering', ""'d"", 'understand', 'film', 'better', 'help', 'Granted', 'are', 'definitely', 'elements', 'film', 'are', 'almost', 'certainly', 'meant', 'artistic', 'rather', 'literal', 'including', 'occasional', 'unseen', 'horse', 'whinnying', 'never', 'did', 'see', 'horse', 'film', 'just', 'lot', 'goats', 'numerous', 'moments', 'showing', 'one', 'children', 'lying', 'asleep', 'ground', 'somewhere', 'rocks', 'hay', 'shrubs', 'etc', 'other', 'aspects', 'such', 'relative', 'lack', 'progress', 'baby', 'born', 'two', 'brothers', 'build', 'wall', 'mostly', 'other', 'person', 'be', 'just', 'living', 'same', 'routine', 'day', 'day', 'general', 'malaise', 'have', 'befallen', 'village', 'children', 'occasionally', 'laugh', 'something', 'find', 'amusing', 'birth', 'one', 'moment', 'entire', 'movie', 'when', 'someone', 'be', 'experiencing', 'genuinely', 'joyful', 'moment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'are', 'meant', 'also', 'be', 'part', 'art', 'film', 'truly', 'reflective', 'life', 'village', 'this.Likewise', 'relationships', 'nearly', 'person', 'film', 'be', 'indifferent', 'best', 'most', 'close', 'ones', 'least', 'undercurrent', 'abuse', 'not', 'outright', 'expression', 'it.I', 'found', 'whole', 'experience', 'very', 'sad', 'fact', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'expression', 'drawing', 'viewer', 'emotionally', 'one', 'was', 'treat', 'watch', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'understood', 'well', 'enough', 'really', '34', 'get', '34', 'did', 'not', 'regret', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'spent']",Times and Winds

Even across the language barrier, I felt by the end that I had known those chaacters for years, and known that village.  Some may say that there was little plot and that nothing happened. But the plot lay in the family tensions between generations, right down to questions of who would survive nomal life, and how.  Most of our life's dramas are played out on the small stages of families, villages, and in the character-forging drama of small, nearly-silent personal apocalypses.  The writing was spare and tight, almost Cormac McCarythesque.  Author Michael Lindvall once said that true heroism was in loving the same people for a long time.

I could smell the Turkish countryside, and actually gasped out loud at the sheer beauty of it at times. The music was rich as well.Emotionally, it felt rather empty. The situations depicted were powerful, but I never felt emotionally connected to the people, so the events lacked emotional impact. The three kids who are central to the plot lacked personality and felt generic. You cared about them because they're kids, and human beings, but not as likable individuals.I did appreciate a girl being included in the cast, a female coming-of-age story being included. That was a HUGE plus for me.
