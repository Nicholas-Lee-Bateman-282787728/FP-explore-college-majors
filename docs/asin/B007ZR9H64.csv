The picture quality is sharp and clear. The audio is clear with no hissing or other detractions. I'm amazed that they found such a good transfer for DVD. You will not be disappointed if you buy the complete series. It beats ANYTHING on network TV or cable. Yes, there was lots of violence, but that was the reality of living back in that era.

1540045,A2URF09M3FJF18,B007ZR9H64,Hoosier,"[1, 1]","Like many Baby Boomers,  I remember this four-year series from my childhood, which was resurrected in a comedic fashion by Dan Ackroyd's &#34;Saturday Night Live&#34; impersonation of Robert Stack's portrayal of  Eliot Ness (I discount Kevin Costner's role in Brian DePalma's 1987 big screen version, since that was not really an attempt to duplicate or even satirize the original t.v. series). So, it's been a pleasure, so far, reacquainting myself with it through adult eyes. The Wikipedia entry on the t.v. series claims it was criticized at the time as one of the medium's most violent shows and I can see why though, by modern standards of course, it seems tame. It was also, perhaps inevitably, faulted for its supposedly distorted portrayal of the criminal legacy of Italian-Americans (and this a decade before the &#34;Godfather&#34; movies). I especially appreciate the Noirish black and white photography and the narration by Walter Winchel that adds just the right documentary feel to the stories. And what a treat it is to see so many performers who later acheived their own big and small screen fame appear early in their careers here. Highly recommended, if you've got the money to spend on a collection like this. If you don't, why not try robbing a bank or peddling ilicit booze and see whether you can escape being apprehended by the Untouchables?",5,Reach Out & Touch,1400544000,"05 20, 2014",2014,1364,"['many', 'Baby', 'Boomers', 'remember', 'four-year', 'series', 'childhood', 'was', 'resurrected', 'comedic', 'fashion', 'Dan', 'Ackroyd', '34', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', '34', 'impersonation', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'portrayal', 'Eliot', 'Ness', 'discount', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'role', 'Brian', 'DePalma', '1987', 'big', 'screen', 'version', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'attempt', 'duplicate', 'even', 'satirize', 'original', 't.v', 'series', 'So', 'been', 'pleasure', 'so', 'far', 'reacquainting', 'adult', 'eyes', 'Wikipedia', 'entry', 't.v', 'series', 'was', 'criticized', 'time', 'one', 'medium', 'most', 'violent', 'shows', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'modern', 'standards', 'course', 'tame', 'was', 'also', 'perhaps', 'inevitably', 'faulted', 'supposedly', 'distorted', 'portrayal', 'criminal', 'legacy', 'Italian-Americans', 'decade', '34', 'Godfather', '34', 'movies', 'especially', 'appreciate', 'Noirish', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'narration', 'Walter', 'Winchel', 'just', 'right', 'documentary', 'feel', 'stories', 'what', 'treat', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'performers', 'who', 'later', 'acheived', 'own', 'big', 'small', 'screen', 'fame', 'appear', 'early', 'careers', 'here', 'Highly', 'recommended', ""'ve"", 'got', 'money', 'spend', 'collection', 'do', ""n't"", 'why', 'not', 'try', 'robbing', 'bank', 'peddling', 'ilicit', 'booze', 'see', 'can', 'escape', 'being', 'apprehended', 'Untouchables']",N/A

1540049,AWJJV7SHBQSXO,B007ZR9H64,Karen P. Rhodes,"[67, 68]","I have been buying the series.  At first, only the first three seasons had been released, and we fans were extremely disappointed.  However, the fourth season was finally released and will come out on 24 July.  This series is worth it.  By today's standards it may seem quaint, and like any other television series it has its flaws.  Television is entertainment designed by a committee.  If you view it as 30s noir, however, it is great.  It's raw, it's gritty, and it got away with some things that just were not done on television in the day (1959-1963).  I cannot say enough about Robert Stack's portrayal of Eliot Ness.  He set the mold in which such characters as Steve McGarrett (Jack Lord's portrayal in the original ""Hawaii Five-0"") and Aaron Hotchner (""Criminal Minds"") were later cast.  I argue with those critics who said that Robert Stack played Ness as cold, unsmiling, unemotional.  Critics never see an entire series, so they miss a lot.  In the episodes, we see Ness smiling as he greets an old friend, sharing a joke with Nick Georgiade's Rico Rossi at the expense of a smug (and crooked) banker, weeping openly at the death of one of his team, and in red-hot anger.  It's a wonderful portrayal.  Robert Stack was not one of those emotive actors; he was much more subtle and conveyed a lot with looks, gestures, and mannerisms (which one fan says Mrs. Eliot Ness said were so like her husband's).  The supporting cast is fine, as well, and my particular favorites were and are Nick Georgiade as Rico Rossi and Paul Picerni as Lee Hobson.  If you pay attention watching the episodes, you will quickly see that there was a repertory-theatre atmosphere about the series, as some of the finest television and film actors of the day, as well as many well-known character actors, appeared multiple times.  There were a number of repeat characters, most notably Neville Brand as Al Capone and Bruce Gordon as his ""enforcer,"" Frank Nitti.  Some have complained about the price, but buyers must consider that when ""The Untouchables"" was filmed, television series episodes were several minutes longer than they are today, and there were more of them in a season.  This series is worth the price.",5,Timeless Television,1338508800,"06 1, 2012",2012,2202,"['have', 'been', 'buying', 'series', 'first', 'only', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'fans', 'were', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'However', 'fourth', 'season', 'was', 'finally', 'released', 'will', 'come', 'out', '24', 'July', 'series', 'today', 'standards', 'may', 'seem', 'quaint', 'other', 'television', 'series', 'flaws', 'Television', 'entertainment', 'designed', 'committee', 'view', '30s', 'noir', 'however', 'great', 'raw', 'gritty', 'got', 'away', 'things', 'just', 'were', 'not', 'done', 'television', 'day', '1959-1963', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'portrayal', 'Eliot', 'Ness', 'set', 'mold', 'such', 'characters', 'Steve', 'McGarrett', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'portrayal', 'original', 'Hawaii', 'Five-0', 'Aaron', 'Hotchner', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'were', 'later', 'cast', 'argue', 'critics', 'who', 'said', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'played', 'Ness', 'cold', 'unsmiling', 'unemotional', 'Critics', 'never', 'see', 'entire', 'series', 'miss', 'lot', 'episodes', 'see', 'Ness', 'smiling', 'old', 'friend', 'sharing', 'joke', 'Nick', 'Georgiade', 'Rico', 'Rossi', 'expense', 'smug', 'crooked', 'banker', 'weeping', 'openly', 'death', 'one', 'team', 'red-hot', 'anger', 'wonderful', 'portrayal', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'emotive', 'actors', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'subtle', 'conveyed', 'lot', 'looks', 'gestures', 'mannerisms', 'one', 'fan', 'Mrs.', 'Eliot', 'Ness', 'said', 'were', 'so', 'husband', 'supporting', 'cast', 'fine', 'as', 'well', 'particular', 'favorites', 'were', 'are', 'Nick', 'Georgiade', 'Rico', 'Rossi', 'Paul', 'Picerni', 'Lee', 'Hobson', 'pay', 'attention', 'watching', 'episodes', 'will', 'quickly', 'see', 'was', 'repertory-theatre', 'atmosphere', 'series', 'finest', 'television', 'film', 'actors', 'day', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'well-known', 'character', 'actors', 'appeared', 'multiple', 'times', 'were', 'number', 'repeat', 'characters', 'most', 'notably', 'Neville', 'Brand', 'Al', 'Capone', 'Bruce', 'Gordon', 'enforcer', 'Frank', 'Nitti', 'have', 'complained', 'price', 'buyers', 'must', 'consider', 'when', 'Untouchables', 'was', 'filmed', 'television', 'series', 'episodes', 'were', 'several', 'minutes', 'longer', 'are', 'today', 'were', 'more', 'season', 'series', 'price']",N/A

I don't know why but I did like the combined episodes made into a couple of movies. Now I am getting to see the whole series and it is really interesting. I know that some of it is fictionalized but the premise is the same- showing the grip that the gangsters had on society. I never heard anyone talk about the start of the narcotics trade once Prohibition ended and how the Mob who initially shunned the distribution ended up running it.The first season covers the sensational gang murders and alcohol rackets. All the machine gun action you expected. I know that some of it is fictionalized but the premise is the same- showing the grip that the gangsters had on society. You can't miss the greed, lack of morals, and love of power that the bosses displayed. Seems like a preview of the current financial/political news.By the third season, the major Chicago gangster stories had been told. So stories from other cities like San Francisco were shown with the added fiction of Elliot Ness being in those locations. The stories are still entertaining but just don't capture the open warfare that went on in Chicago. Several stories deal with the weeks and months prior to the end of Prohibition with the gangsters knowing that they have to move into other illegal activities.I know that some of it is fictionalized but the premise is the same- showing the grip that the gangsters had on society.
