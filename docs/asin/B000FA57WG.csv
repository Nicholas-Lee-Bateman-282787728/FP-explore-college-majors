I was somewhat disappointed in those episodes. They seemed too predictable, too gory, too much gratutious (female) nudity. Yet I was totally knocked out by Homecoming and rushed out to buy it as soon as it was available on DVD. If you are a conservative Republican, you'll probably hate it. But if you are no fan of the current administration and like political satire, you will be blown away by this entry in the MOH series. Great writing, wonderful acting, especially by the lead, Jon Tenney. People like Ann Coulter, Karl Rove, Jerry Falwell, and Dubaya deserve to be satirized. Thanks to Joe Dante for having the courage to make this episode. More MOH episodes should be like this.",5,best entry in the moh series so far,1166918400,"12 24, 2006",2006,821,"['had', 'rented', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'being', 'fan', 'anthology', 'series', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'episodes', 'seemed', 'too', 'predictable', 'too', 'gory', 'too', 'much', 'gratutious', 'female', 'nudity', 'was', 'totally', 'knocked', 'out', 'Homecoming', 'rushed', 'out', 'buy', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'available', 'DVD', 'are', 'conservative', 'Republican', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'hate', 'are', 'fan', 'current', 'administration', 'like', 'political', 'satire', 'will', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'entry', 'MOH', 'series', 'Great', 'writing', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'especially', 'lead', 'Jon', 'Tenney', 'People', 'Ann', 'Coulter', 'Karl', 'Rove', 'Jerry', 'Falwell', 'Dubaya', 'deserve', 'be', 'satirized', 'Thanks', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'having', 'courage', 'make', 'episode', 'More', 'MOH', 'episodes', 'should', 'be']",Homecoming masters Of Horror
986766,A3HJE347MA83EM,B000FA57WG,"Army Doc ""engineer307""","[15, 37]","I am a physician and a soldier currently in Iraq on my third tour.  I have sent men home who were not left whole and I have sent men back in caskets.  Luckily, my experience has been far more of the former.  We have a greater than 90% save rate over here for the wounded.  (You should see ""Baghdad ER"", also on DVD from Amazon, for that story.)  I saw this trash while in Iraq and could not have been more offended.  I am over here risking my life for the free speech of those who dissent but I cannot stomach lies told over the bodies of soldiers who have proudly given all for their country.  The writers of this lie have obviously not spoken to any soldiers who have been over here.  The vast majority who are injured are very saddened that they are leaving their buddies and that they themselves are out of the fight.  Every soldier from my unit who has been injured felt this way.  I know, I see every one of them.  Many who have died left letters to be sent to their families stating that they believed in what we are doing here and that they were proud of their service.  This film is a lie and not even good horror or satire.Judged on its own merits as a film, it falls far short.  The script is atrocious.  The plot is beyond predictable.  The characters are as one dimensional as it gets.  I watched this episode as part of a boxed set purchased in-theater and never would have watched it if I had known the premise prior to popping the disc in my player.  This is precisely the point of my review.  If you don't want to see someone who has never been a soldier try to speak for soldiers who are more than capable of speaking for themselves then don't watch this.  If you think you will be seeing good horror or even good satire then you will be be sorely disappointed.Interestingly, a later reviewer makes comments regarding the political and racial make-up of the current military.  Based on his comments, it is obvious that he has neither donned a uniform nor been deployed into the line of fire in a combat zone.  He has certainly never been in the US military.  I have worn the uniform both as an enlisted soldier and as a commissioned officer.  The purported divide in political beliefs is not that wide.  As far as free speech goes, I support the right to free speech more than anyone else.  That being said, it is a lie for me to put words in someone else's mouth and state that I speak for him when, in fact, I do not.  If I said a crtain later reviewer uttered a racial slur and he did not, this is not protected free speech.  It is slander.  If I print that then it is libel.  For example, when Cindy Sheehan says she speaks for soldiers and expresses what they want to say but cannot, she is a liar.  Her views are overwhelmingly denounced by soldiers.  That said, I'm sure she loved this episode immensely.",1,Offensive to Soldiers,1153958400,"07 27, 2006",2006,2829,"['am', 'physician', 'soldier', 'currently', 'Iraq', 'third', 'tour', 'have', 'sent', 'men', 'home', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'left', 'whole', 'have', 'sent', 'men', 'back', 'caskets', 'Luckily', 'experience', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'former', 'have', 'greater', '90', '%', 'save', 'rate', 'here', 'wounded', 'should', 'see', 'Baghdad', 'ER', 'also', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'story', 'saw', 'trash', 'Iraq', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'offended', 'am', 'over', 'here', 'risking', 'life', 'free', 'speech', 'who', 'dissent', 'can', 'not', 'stomach', 'lies', 'told', 'bodies', 'soldiers', 'who', 'have', 'proudly', 'given', 'country', 'writers', 'lie', 'have', 'obviously', 'not', 'spoken', 'soldiers', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'here', 'vast', 'majority', 'who', 'are', 'injured', 'are', 'very', 'saddened', 'are', 'leaving', 'buddies', 'are', 'fight', 'soldier', 'unit', 'who', 'been', 'injured', 'felt', 'way', 'know', 'see', 'one', 'Many', 'who', 'have', 'died', 'left', 'letters', 'be', 'sent', 'families', 'stating', 'believed', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'here', 'were', 'proud', 'service', 'film', 'lie', 'not', 'even', 'good', 'horror', 'satire.Judged', 'own', 'merits', 'film', 'far', 'short', 'script', 'atrocious', 'plot', 'predictable', 'characters', 'are', 'one', 'dimensional', 'watched', 'episode', 'part', 'boxed', 'set', 'purchased', 'in-theater', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'watched', 'had', 'known', 'premise', 'prior', 'popping', 'disc', 'player', 'precisely', 'point', 'review', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'soldier', 'try', 'speak', 'soldiers', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'capable', 'speaking', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'good', 'horror', 'even', 'good', 'satire', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed.Interestingly', 'later', 'reviewer', 'comments', 'regarding', 'political', 'racial', 'make-up', 'current', 'military', 'Based', 'comments', 'obvious', 'donned', 'uniform', 'been', 'deployed', 'line', 'fire', 'combat', 'zone', 'certainly', 'never', 'been', 'US', 'military', 'have', 'worn', 'uniform', 'enlisted', 'soldier', 'commissioned', 'officer', 'purported', 'divide', 'political', 'beliefs', 'not', 'wide', 'As', 'far', 'free', 'speech', 'support', 'right', 'free', 'speech', 'more', 'anyone', 'else', 'being', 'said', 'lie', 'put', 'words', 'someone', 'else', 'mouth', 'state', 'speak', 'when', 'fact', 'do', 'not', 'said', 'crtain', 'later', 'reviewer', 'uttered', 'racial', 'slur', 'did', 'not', 'not', 'protected', 'free', 'speech', 'slander', 'print', 'then', 'libel', 'example', 'when', 'Cindy', 'Sheehan', 'soldiers', 'what', 'want', 'say', 'can', 'not', 'liar', 'views', 'are', 'overwhelmingly', 'denounced', 'soldiers', 'said', ""'m"", 'sure', 'loved', 'episode', 'immensely']",Homecoming masters Of Horror

986768,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B000FA57WG,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[25, 43]","For starters I could understand why this episode of Masters of Horror has become such a polarizing phenomena in the blog-world of the internet. Joe Dante sure picked himself the perfect subject to satirize if what he wanted was to cause controversy and dialogue. His episode for the Masters of Horror anthology for Showtime was easily a Red State vs. Blue State episode. If you're a supporter of Bush then you'd hate this episode with a passion and probably call it everything from treasonous to awful. If you're not a supporter of Bush then you'd call this episode timely, thought-provoking and political satire at its best. There's not much room in the middle for how this episode pushes people's buttons.The episode was adapted, and updated for the current geopolitical climate, from a short story by Dale Bailey titled ""Death and Suffrage"" by Sam Hamm. In the original short story the dead soon begin rising from the grave to head to the voting booth to cast their vote during a presidential election. Instead of dead soldiers as they're depicted in the MoH episode, the zombies were people killed due to gun violence. Joe Dante's ""Homecoming"" takes that basic premise but instead uses the current War in Iraq as the grievance the zombies have with the current political leadership. It's never mentioned that Iraq is the place the war is happening at, but one has to be very naive and living in a cave for the last three years not to read into it. There's not much what you could say as straight horror in ""Homecoming"". Sure there are zombies and a grisly death or two on screen, but the true horror of the episode is how the fantastical premise of the story does bear a politically charged message.The Masters of Horror anthology series has been a hit and miss project and people's favorite episodes have varied. Joe Dante seems to have picked a story that he knows would be controversial and might be hated by people. He sure succeeded in that aspect of his choice. But I admire the guy for taking the baton of choosing something important to him and be-damned if people liked it or not. The direction is actually very economical and the pacing pretty fast. The entire episode is timed just under an hour, but the whole story breezes by very quickly and Dante still gets alot of his message through. The performance by Jon Tenney as David Murch the political strategist was very good and his transformation from manipulative political wonk to someone who fully understand why the dead soldiers are doing what they're doing is done well. Thea Gill as the Ann Coulter-ish Jane Cleaver and genre veteran Robert Picardo as the Karl Rove-ish Kurt Rand finishes out the other highlight performances in the episode. Thea Gill's performance as Jane Cleaver is hilarious and over-the-top until one realizes that even then her characterization of Jane Cleaver still falls wholly short of the real Ann Coulter.Joe Dante's ""Homecoming"" was not your typical zombie story. There's no brain or flesh-eating to be seen throughout the hour-long episode. There's an abundance of great zombie make-up effects from the masters of KNB EFX. Some people truly hated this episode for its content and for not being truly horrifying. Some loved it for its condemnation and its anti-Bush administration rhetoric. I like to consider myself in the middle of it all. The episode was done well. I might not have been sold on every piece of political theme and message Dante bluntly put in the episode, but I have to admit that it did resonate. Plus, Dante's got marbles of steel for even filming and going through with this episode. I have to give the man his proper respect just for that alone.",4,politically-charged black comedy from the most unlikely of horror directors,1153094400,"07 17, 2006",2006,3670,"['starters', 'could', 'understand', 'why', 'episode', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'become', 'polarizing', 'phenomena', 'blog-world', 'internet', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'sure', 'picked', 'perfect', 'subject', 'satirize', 'what', 'wanted', 'was', 'cause', 'controversy', 'dialogue', 'episode', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'anthology', 'Showtime', 'was', 'easily', 'Red', 'State', 'vs.', 'Blue', 'State', 'episode', ""'re"", 'supporter', 'Bush', 'then', ""'d"", 'hate', 'episode', 'passion', 'probably', 'call', 'everything', 'treasonous', 'awful', ""'re"", 'not', 'supporter', 'Bush', 'then', ""'d"", 'call', 'episode', 'timely', 'thought-provoking', 'political', 'satire', 'best', 'not', 'much', 'room', 'middle', 'how', 'episode', 'people', 'buttons.The', 'episode', 'was', 'adapted', 'updated', 'current', 'geopolitical', 'climate', 'short', 'story', 'Dale', 'Bailey', 'titled', 'Death', 'Suffrage', 'Sam', 'Hamm', 'original', 'short', 'story', 'dead', 'soon', 'begin', 'rising', 'grave', 'head', 'voting', 'booth', 'cast', 'vote', 'presidential', 'election', 'Instead', 'dead', 'soldiers', ""'re"", 'depicted', 'MoH', 'episode', 'zombies', 'were', 'people', 'killed', 'due', 'gun', 'violence', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'Homecoming', 'basic', 'premise', 'instead', 'current', 'War', 'Iraq', 'grievance', 'zombies', 'have', 'current', 'political', 'leadership', 'never', 'mentioned', 'Iraq', 'place', 'war', 'happening', 'one', 'be', 'very', 'naive', 'living', 'cave', 'last', 'three', 'years', 'not', 'read', 'not', 'much', 'what', 'could', 'say', 'straight', 'horror', 'Homecoming', 'Sure', 'are', 'zombies', 'grisly', 'death', 'two', 'screen', 'true', 'horror', 'episode', 'how', 'fantastical', 'premise', 'story', 'bear', 'politically', 'charged', 'message.The', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'anthology', 'series', 'been', 'hit', 'miss', 'project', 'people', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'have', 'varied', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'have', 'picked', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'controversial', 'might', 'be', 'hated', 'people', 'sure', 'succeeded', 'aspect', 'choice', 'admire', 'guy', 'taking', 'baton', 'choosing', 'something', 'important', 'be-damned', 'people', 'liked', 'not', 'direction', 'actually', 'very', 'economical', 'pacing', 'pretty', 'fast', 'entire', 'episode', 'timed', 'just', 'hour', 'whole', 'story', 'breezes', 'very', 'quickly', 'Dante', 'still', 'alot', 'message', 'performance', 'Jon', 'Tenney', 'David', 'Murch', 'political', 'strategist', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'transformation', 'manipulative', 'political', 'wonk', 'someone', 'who', 'fully', 'understand', 'why', 'dead', 'soldiers', 'are', 'doing', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'done', 'well', 'Thea', 'Gill', 'Ann', 'Coulter-ish', 'Jane', 'Cleaver', 'genre', 'veteran', 'Robert', 'Picardo', 'Karl', 'Rove-ish', 'Kurt', 'Rand', 'out', 'other', 'highlight', 'performances', 'episode', 'Thea', 'Gill', 'performance', 'Jane', 'Cleaver', 'hilarious', 'over-the-top', 'one', 'even', 'then', 'characterization', 'Jane', 'Cleaver', 'still', 'wholly', 'short', 'real', 'Ann', 'Coulter.Joe', 'Dante', 'Homecoming', 'was', 'not', 'typical', 'zombie', 'story', 'brain', 'flesh-eating', 'be', 'seen', 'hour-long', 'episode', 'abundance', 'great', 'zombie', 'make-up', 'effects', 'masters', 'KNB', 'EFX', 'people', 'truly', 'hated', 'episode', 'content', 'not', 'being', 'truly', 'horrifying', 'loved', 'condemnation', 'anti-Bush', 'administration', 'rhetoric', 'like', 'consider', 'middle', 'episode', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'sold', 'piece', 'political', 'theme', 'message', 'Dante', 'bluntly', 'put', 'episode', 'have', 'admit', 'did', 'resonate', 'Dante', 'got', 'marbles', 'steel', 'even', 'filming', 'going', 'episode', 'have', 'give', 'man', 'proper', 'respect', 'just', 'alone']",Homecoming masters Of Horror

These are two facets that do have a bearing on my perspective, but they do not make me any less capable of recognizing virtue or merit - at least no less than others who write reviews.Unlike many of the clearly strident and biased reviews writtenhave indicated, I feel that comedy and horror are visceral in nature, and that one's political and philosophical inclinations are separate factors which intrudes rather than enhances the nature of the sensations, though it is often hard for some to separate them.Doing my best to review Homecoming objectively, I have to say it really wasn't a good film or story.  It wasn't scary or clever or entertaining or even very interesting.  It was mainly just a one-dimensional political rant where a horror film should have been, a dark comedy/satire which wasn't all that funny (granted, I am not an easy laugh), and campy B-movie propaganda where a clever story could have been told and presented.One thing that does bother me is the hypocrisy that Dante and the other partisan screechers ultimately flaunt: they don't really care anything about those who serve this nation generally, or in a time of war specifically.  Neither he nor or other liberal ""cultural elitists"" who are so proud of themselves respect or appreciate what those who serve this country (let alone in wartime) go through and could not understand nor care less about their reasons for service.  Like many of their ilk (including the fatuous Matt Damon), they think those in the military do so because of a lack of options/money/education/etc.  To then presume to speak on the behalf of those who gave their life is not only disingenuous, but shameless.  I spent much of my career serving under a President (Clinton) whose attitude towards the military and its members was one of indifference at best and disdain the rest of the time.What actually bothers me the most about this is Joe Dante being considered ""a Master of Horror"".  If any of those who raved about the ""message"" of this film had could put down your protest signs and Greenday posters and stop patting yourself on the back for a moment to examine the question honestly, you would have to admit to yourself that Joe Dante really didn't belong in a list of horror icon directors (besides The Howling, he just doesn't have the resume').  I realize that many of the stories and directors in this series have a political axe to grind, but at least John Carpenter and Dario Argento have earned their place among the Horror genre's esteemed (and I thought the vignette Cigarette Burns was really good, though I was a huge fan of In The Mouth of Madness, which it reminded me of).Truth be told, you don't have to be a conservative or Republican to dislike this film.  And being a strident, ham-fisted propagandist doesn't make Joe Dante a good horror film-maker, let alone a legend in the Horror film genre.",2,"Lame, sanctimonious screed from a perenially overrated hack",1174867200,"03 26, 2007",2007,2985,"['am', 'veteran', 'indie', 'film-maker', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'worked', 'budget', 'one', 'had', 'are', 'two', 'facets', 'do', 'have', 'bearing', 'perspective', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'less', 'capable', 'recognizing', 'virtue', 'merit', 'least', 'less', 'others', 'who', 'write', 'reviews.Unlike', 'many', 'clearly', 'strident', 'biased', 'reviews', 'writtenhave', 'indicated', 'feel', 'comedy', 'horror', 'are', 'visceral', 'nature', 'one', 'political', 'philosophical', 'inclinations', 'are', 'separate', 'factors', 'intrudes', 'rather', 'enhances', 'nature', 'sensations', 'often', 'hard', 'separate', 'them.Doing', 'best', 'review', 'Homecoming', 'objectively', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'film', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'clever', 'entertaining', 'even', 'very', 'interesting', 'was', 'mainly', 'just', 'one-dimensional', 'political', 'rant', 'where', 'horror', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'dark', 'comedy/satire', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'granted', 'am', 'not', 'easy', 'laugh', 'campy', 'B-movie', 'propaganda', 'where', 'clever', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'presented.One', 'thing', 'bother', 'hypocrisy', 'Dante', 'other', 'partisan', 'screechers', 'ultimately', 'flaunt', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'anything', 'who', 'serve', 'nation', 'generally', 'time', 'war', 'specifically', 'other', 'liberal', 'cultural', 'elitists', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'proud', 'respect', 'appreciate', 'what', 'who', 'serve', 'country', 'let', 'alone', 'wartime', 'go', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'care', 'less', 'reasons', 'service', 'many', 'ilk', 'including', 'fatuous', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'think', 'military', 'do', 'so', 'lack', 'options/money/education/etc', 'then', 'presume', 'speak', 'behalf', 'who', 'gave', 'life', 'not', 'only', 'disingenuous', 'shameless', 'spent', 'much', 'career', 'serving', 'President', 'Clinton', 'attitude', 'military', 'members', 'was', 'one', 'indifference', 'best', 'disdain', 'rest', 'actually', 'most', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'being', 'considered', 'Master', 'Horror', 'who', 'raved', 'message', 'film', 'had', 'could', 'put', 'down', 'protest', 'signs', 'Greenday', 'posters', 'stop', 'patting', 'back', 'moment', 'examine', 'question', 'honestly', 'would', 'have', 'admit', 'yourself', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'belong', 'list', 'horror', 'icon', 'directors', 'Howling', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'resume', 'realize', 'many', 'stories', 'directors', 'series', 'have', 'political', 'axe', 'grind', 'least', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'have', 'earned', 'place', 'Horror', 'genre', 'esteemed', 'thought', 'vignette', 'Cigarette', 'Burns', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'Mouth', 'Madness', 'reminded', '.Truth', 'be', 'told', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'conservative', 'Republican', 'dislike', 'film', 'being', 'strident', 'ham-fisted', 'propagandist', ""n't"", 'make', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'good', 'horror', 'film-maker', 'let', 'alone', 'legend', 'Horror', 'film', 'genre']",Homecoming masters Of Horror

Dead soldiers begin to return as zombies who are less interested in eating brains than casting ballots--against the current administration.  This puts the right wing spin machine into overdrive, providing director Joe Dante with ample opportunity to skewer neo-conservatives for hypocrisy and cynicism.Your opinion of this episode is bound to be colored by your feelings about the war in Iraq, so I'll be up front with mine--I've been against it from the start.  Yet this episode still doesn't sit well with me.  Conservatives are criticized for claiming to speak for dead soldiers to make a political point, but isn't that what Dante and screenwriter Sam Hamm have done with their script?  Does it make it right just because they are on the other side of the issue?  The allegory is rather heavy-handed, but it has a pleasantly creepy atmosphere up until the zombie agenda is revealed, and Thea Gill is funny as a thinly veiled Ann Coulter castrating conservative babe.

I happen to fall under the latter category.""Homecoming"" is directed by Joe Dante who also directed one of my favorite horror films of all times,The Howling. There he was able to incorporate humor with bone-chilling terror. Something he doesn't do too well with ""Homecoming"". The humour is there but the horror is nowhere to be found. This well acted mess about soldier zombies coming back to life to vote is a commentary on the Bush administration and the war it's most famous for but as a horror tale, it left me cold (no pun intended) and bored to pieces. Personally, I do not care if a film is trying to make a political statement that I agree or disagree with. I watch films, and especially horror films (my favorite genre) to be entertained and Dante failed me. Go ahead and bash the previous (then current) administration using art but come on, if you are going to make a zombie movie than you better deliver the gory goods; severed limbs, entrails, brains, ripped apart flesh, blood squirting in every direction, a few  scenes of the putrefied green yuck emanating from the undead's rotting flesh etc. I sat through this zombie film and got none of the above. Maybe a few scenes of tame violence and decent zombie make-up. Even Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" gave me more goosebumps than this turkey. Maybe John Landis should have been the choice to direct this installment since he did a pretty good job with that music video and his contribution to season one was a lot more successful in combining comedy with some mild tension. At least, hisDeer Womanwas wickedly amusing.The pacing is also excruciating. At barely 60 minutes the film moves at a turtle's pace and by the time the end credits start rolling, that is, if you're still awake, you're left questioning how a 2 hour long movie only took 60 minutes? The reason this escapes a one star rating is because Thea Gill gives a great performance and by her presence alone, the entertainment value of this short piece is raised slightly and the zombie make-up is not half-bad. As far as the horror is concerned, well, how do I put this mildly? There is none. If you're looking for thrills, chills and disturbing spills, you're better off watching an episode of ""Dancing with the Stars"". Unless your idea of time well spent is spending 60 minutes of your life watching overtly cheesy zombie's trying to make a political statement.

What do soldiers do when faced with overwhelming odds?This story is vet political in nature even though it is thinly disguised as a zombie film.  The zombie effects are thin with most merely being simple makeup jobs.  Only a few show any real wounds or decay.  Again, this is a political film and as such it fails in the horror department.

OK, that's out of the way.  :DNow.  I read the short story that this is based on, and I found it ham-fisted and overwrought.  The same applies to this film, only doubly so.  At least in the story, it was a semi-clever conceit to have victims of gun violence return to vote; here, the warping of that concept into... this, was just loathsome.  It's merely another example of a director whose career (let's face it) is close to being completely lost to the mists of time trying to make himself relevant again.It just didn't work.  For one thing, the timing is all wrong for something like this.  In ten or twenty years, it could have been made and people's reactions would most likely be a lot more favorable.  But as it stands now, emotions and opinions on the fiasco in the Middle East are just too raw and volatile.The film also tries too hard to cram as many push-buttons in as it can.  Why did we need the Ann Coulter character?  Yeah, the woman's a psycho, most people are aware of that.  Why hit the viewing public over the head with it?  There is a point where things cease being satire and become merely... stupid.  The no-holds-barred portrayal of the Republican party as eeeeevil was just insipid as well.  When are people going to get it through their thick heads that the Republicans and Democrats are two sides of the same coin?  There is no black and white.  Both are gray and dirty.  Get over it.OK, now that my political rant is finished, let's bitch about some zombie-mythos problems with the film.  For one thing, why does the main character's brother come back to life?

David Murch (Jon Tenney) and Jane Cleaver (Thea Gill doing her best Anne Coulter imitation) offer up the typical Republican soundbites in defense of the (tactfully unnamed) President's ill-advised War in Iraq.  One of those soundbites?  ""I wish those soldiers COULD come back, because I'm sure they'd tell America how proud they were to serve and give their life for this great country of ours.""

986789,A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B000FA57WG,Matthew King,"[4, 9]","Joe Dante is the director of this notorious episode in the Masters of Horror series.  Dante's credits in the horror realm are noteworthy.  His first foray into the genre was 1978's cheesy guilty pleasure ""Piranha"".  In 1981, Dante lensed ""The Howling"" an absolute classic of the genre that is to this day still considered by many to be the best werewolf film ever.  His career really took off when Steven Spielberg (a big fan of ""Piranha"") hired him to make ""Gremlins"".  Released in 1984, the film became a humongous hit worldwide, even spawning successful lines of toys and trading cards.  While Dante has been rather quiet in the past decade, ""Homecoming"" marks a nice return to the genre for a director rightly bestowed the title of ""Master of Horror"".Homecoming is quite unique within zombie lore, a genre that suffers from a decided lack of uniqueness.  Plot: On the verge of a Presidential election, a Republican spokesperson triggers an unexpected reaction when he wishes that those who perished in the war were alive and able to vote.  Instantly, deceased veterans rise from their star spangled banner-draped coffins looking to find peace and stop another term with a right-winged president, not by eating the brains of the administration that sent them to their graves but by stuffing the ballot boxes.Only nominally a horror piece, Dante's episode is far more horrified by the smug, media-savvy culture of the contemporary right than it is the monsters sprung from the grave.  Clearly a man with major issues concerning the state of American media, politics and foreign policy, he openly confronts these feelings with a scathing satire of the American right, especially through the Jane Cleaver character.  Cleaver is a right-wing political commentator of the Ann Coulter mold who draws blood with sound bites, enjoys first date S&M; sessions, and gleefully hoists a shotgun in the direction of the ""pussies"" and ""dissidents"" who dare return so liberally from the dead.But while it's undoubtedly a fresh take on zombie lore, this episode is far from being without its faults.  Too often it suffers from inept acting and moments of insufferable cheese.  Also, the biased opinions and stereotypes of republicans is a bit of a turnoff, even if you're a liberal.  Homecoming screams ""message film"".  I loved Homecoming however I would have to disagree with the many people who believe this is the series' best episode.  For that, I would point to Don Coscarelli's ""Incident on and off a mountain road"", a heart-wrenching exercise in no-holds-barred horror.

Jon Tenney stars as a political consultant and speech writer whose wish for a grieving mother gets granted in a deadly way when dead Iraq veterans return to life.  The catch here is that they're not coming back to feast on the living, they want their voices heard as the presidential election is right around the corner, and if they aren't heard, well then, you get the idea.  The political satire is superb here as Dante guides a brilliantly black comedy that aspires to be so much more, and it nearly gets there too.  The only real weak point of Homecoming is the denouement which seems rushed and not as strong as the first three quarters of the film, but other than that Homecoming fires on all cylinders.  The zombie makeup is superb (what else would you expect from industry vets Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger?) and Dante provides memorable moments throughout, particularly from one of his favorite actors Robert Picardo (and no, other Dante fave Dick Miller isn't here sadly), which rounds out the nice package here.

And while Dante has a much heavier hand with the social commentary than does Bailey, Homecoming is still more fun than two-- yes, two!-- barrels of monkeys.David Murch (Jon Tenney) is a professional spin doctor working for the current government's administration, who have gotten involved in a very unpopular war. (Sound familiar?) One night, while on a talk show, confronting a woman whose son was killed in the hostilities, Murch wishes, aloud, that her son weren't dead.

While public opinion about the zombies is at first what one would expect, as the zombies start integrating themselves, the public begins to support their right to exist, and from there, everything starts getting really, really complicated.Dante, whose career has been exceptionally low-key ever since 1989's The 'burbs (a fun film, but it bombed badly at the box office), has been quietly cranking out two kinds of movies for the past twenty years-- big-budget stinkers (Small Soldiers, Looney Tunes: Back in Action) and quiet, indie flicks that are actually worth your time (Matinee, The Second Civil War). His seeming growing fascination with sociopolitical commentary is increasingly obvious in his choice of projects, so Homecoming was a natural fit for him. He hasn't learned to do it subtly yet, but then anyone expecting subtlety from the guy who directed Gremlins is probably looking in the wrong direction. His signature blend of comedy and horror, however, is just as strong as it ever was, and he turns in an enjoyable Masters of Horror episode here.

I'm not sure whether to take this as a black comedy or an all-out slap against the current administration and its war, but either way I liked it a lot and I applaud Joe Dante for throwing it out there.  Seems as though veterans of a war (unnamed, of course, but we all know what it is) are rising up from the grave to....VOTE?  Yep, to vote, and not for the current president, either.  Too bad they were lied to and their votes didn't count, though, I'd hate to think about what happened later.  And for those who take this as an insult to our soldiers and our country, etc?

And what about science-fiction movies with themes/plots re: dystopian futures?  (Logan's Run, 12 Monkeys, Soylent Green, episodes of the Twilight Zone, the list goes on and on...)

That's the great thing about fiction: One can take concepts/themes and ""tweak"" them 'til the cows come home to roost.My point, if I have one: Homecoming is NOT a classic, but a very amusing low-budget hunk of satire!

986796,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B000FA57WG,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[10, 23]","Dante's episode no doubt will get the most uneven reviews due to the fact that he made a political film.  Personally, I love my horror films and the music I listen to, to be politic-free.  I always felt that politics goes against what a good horror film(or song) should be.  It's one of the few escapes from the harsh realities around you, so why should it invade my entertainment?  There are always exceptions to the rule however.  After all, a good song is a good song, and a good film is a good film regardless.  Even the original Night Of The Living Dead had a message.  I really enjoyed Dante's episode.  Some people sure won't and don't from what I see, but to take this seriously is...stupid actually.  Dante himself says in the documentary that the film is biased and exaggerated.  I don't think he's trying to give America a wakeup call or change our minds, but instead is venting his own thoughts through a horror film.  That's the beauty of this Masters Of Horror series.  The directors all have carte blanche to do whatever the hell they want.  Stuart Gordon wanted do adapt Lovecraft, Coscarelli wanted to do a Lansdale story, Landis wanted do do something a tad lighter, why not Dante doing a political satire?  Yeah, I see what Dante's saying.  He's pounding his message right down on our heads.  I certainly have my own opinions on the war and the soldiers fighting there, but  I don't let this film influence that.  It's horror fantasy, message or not, and I watched it with more of a ""what if this really happened?"" state of mind than anything else.  Dante could have done this about Vietnam or Korea, it wouldn't make a difference to me.  I've always enjoyed Dante's brand of comedy/horror, and that's how I watched this film.  It's not really scary, nor is it as funny as some have stated, but I still like it.  Compared to the rest of the Masters series it is a bit of a lesser episode.  The zombies aren't really played for laughs, nor do they rip people to shreds like Romero's, but it's quite entertaining nonetheless.  In a way I'd almost compare it to Bill Lustig's Uncle Sam film.  Both would be great for a 4th of July double feature.  But whether you agree with Dante or not, horror fans should see this for the basic fact that it's entertaining.  Not Dante's best work by a longshot, but entertaining in that schlocky way I dig.",4,Zombie Politics,1152403200,"07 9, 2006",2006,2358,"['Dante', 'episode', 'doubt', 'will', 'get', 'most', 'uneven', 'reviews', 'due', 'fact', 'made', 'political', 'film', 'Personally', 'love', 'horror', 'films', 'music', 'listen', 'be', 'politic-free', 'always', 'felt', 'politics', 'what', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'song', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'escapes', 'harsh', 'realities', 'so', 'why', 'should', 'invade', 'entertainment', 'are', 'always', 'exceptions', 'rule', 'however', 'good', 'song', 'good', 'song', 'good', 'film', 'good', 'film', 'regardless', 'Even', 'original', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'had', 'message', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Dante', 'episode', 'people', 'sure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'what', 'see', 'take', 'seriously', 'stupid', 'actually', 'Dante', 'documentary', 'film', 'biased', 'exaggerated', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'trying', 'give', 'America', 'wakeup', 'call', 'change', 'minds', 'instead', 'venting', 'own', 'thoughts', 'horror', 'film', 'beauty', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'series', 'directors', 'have', 'carte', 'blanche', 'do', 'whatever', 'hell', 'want', 'Stuart', 'Gordon', 'wanted', 'do', 'adapt', 'Lovecraft', 'Coscarelli', 'wanted', 'do', 'Lansdale', 'story', 'Landis', 'wanted', 'do', 'do', 'something', 'tad', 'lighter', 'why', 'not', 'Dante', 'doing', 'political', 'satire', 'Yeah', 'see', 'what', 'Dante', 'saying', 'pounding', 'message', 'right', 'down', 'heads', 'certainly', 'have', 'own', 'opinions', 'war', 'soldiers', 'fighting', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'film', 'influence', 'horror', 'fantasy', 'message', 'not', 'watched', 'more', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'state', 'mind', 'anything', 'else', 'Dante', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Vietnam', 'Korea', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'difference', ""'ve"", 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Dante', 'brand', 'comedy/horror', 'how', 'watched', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'scary', 'as', 'funny', 'have', 'stated', 'still', 'Compared', 'rest', 'Masters', 'series', 'bit', 'lesser', 'episode', 'zombies', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'played', 'laughs', 'do', 'rip', 'people', 'shreds', 'Romero', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'nonetheless', 'way', ""'d"", 'almost', 'compare', 'Bill', 'Lustig', 'Uncle', 'Sam', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'great', '4th', 'July', 'double', 'feature', 'agree', 'Dante', 'not', 'horror', 'fans', 'should', 'see', 'basic', 'fact', 'entertaining', 'Not', 'Dante', 'best', 'work', 'longshot', 'entertaining', 'schlocky', 'way', 'dig']",Homecoming masters Of Horror
