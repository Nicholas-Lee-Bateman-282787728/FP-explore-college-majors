Mathieu Kassovitz doesn't give us any great surprises (you can figure out what is going on fairly early in the film) plot wise, but he gives some great shots. And Halle Berry gives us some great moments on film. She shows just how great of an actress, just how intense she is. The rest of the cast gives a solid performance. The dvd is a bit sparse. There is the Limp Bizkit video, &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;, which is a great song and a very well done video. There is also a commentary with director Mathieu Kassovitz and DOP Matthew Libatique, who actually calls himself a cinematographer on the commentary track. As well he should because the cinematography itself is a character in itself. The lighting, the camera movements, the locations, all add to the atmosphere, more so than in many other movies. The two compliment each other both in filming and in the commentary track.",4,it's a pretty good show,1080259200,"03 26, 2004",2004,944,"['Gothika', 'pretty', 'good', 'horror/psychological', 'suspense', 'show', 'Mathieu', 'Kassovitz', ""n't"", 'give', 'great', 'surprises', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'fairly', 'early', 'film', 'plot', 'wise', 'great', 'shots', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'great', 'moments', 'film', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'actress', 'just', 'how', 'intense', 'rest', 'cast', 'solid', 'performance', 'dvd', 'bit', 'sparse', 'Limp', 'Bizkit', 'video', 'quot', 'Behind', 'Blue', 'Eyes', 'quot', 'great', 'song', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'video', 'also', 'commentary', 'director', 'Mathieu', 'Kassovitz', 'DOP', 'Matthew', 'Libatique', 'who', 'actually', 'cinematographer', 'commentary', 'track', 'As', 'well', 'should', 'because', 'cinematography', 'character', 'lighting', 'camera', 'movements', 'locations', 'add', 'atmosphere', 'more', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'two', 'compliment', 'other', 'filming', 'commentary', 'track']",N/A

I have a problem with clich&eacute;s, especially when they can't seem to back themselves up with anything substantial as a form of recompense.  Instead, films like `Gothika' lather on the `been there done that' with a heavy hand, sprinkling in generically effective `thrills' in an attempt to say ""see, we made you jump in your seat"".  Sadly, those thrills die off pretty quickly when the plot holes become more and more evident and the straight-laced direction seems to take the viewer on a path leading to predictability.  Think `The Sixth Sense' (that ending was such a rip-off) meets `What Lies Beneath' with an R rating and some gore.  Oh yeah, and far inferior performances (what WAS Penelope Cruz doing?) and a script that didn't understand itself.  You will spot the bad guy the minute you see him, even if the ridiculous plot tries to convince you it's someone else, and you will roll your eyes at the films conclusion, which overworks the CGI to deliver an action sequence that takes you outside the creepy tones they were trying to create here.  Insane asylums are typically scary places, but you really have to work your environment to create lasting chills.  `Gothika' seems content with just dropping us in a scenario that seems scary and then leaving us to get bored with it.  Thankfully the overrated Halle Berry manages to attack the flow of the film with a performance that reads surprising sincerity.

If I had gone with my own gut instinct to see Gothika in the theater last summer I wouldn't have missed out on a very good film; professional critics can be wrong you know.  In any case, now that I've seen it I can't understand why it didn't get better critical reactions.  This was a movie well worth the admission price, more so than some that the critics raved about last year.Gothika is a creepy film noir-style thriller about a women's prison psychiatrist, Dr. Miranda Grey, and the events of one night that changed everything.  She wakes up in her own ward to discover her husband brutally murdered and herself the suspect under the care of a former colleague played by Robert Downey Jr.  She hears and feels the presence of something supernatural harassing her almost constantly.  Although in her heart she knows she is sane, she begins to doubt herself as she sees and hears things with no explanation and becomes more and more paranoid.  A former patient, Chloe, is a girl who has been telling similar stories all along and now it is starting to look as if she really might have been visited by an evil spirit.  So Dr. Grey now has to convince everyone around her, including herself, that what she has been experiencing is not the delusions of somebody in denial.  Not easy for an apparent madwoman shrieking in a cell.The most disturbing thing about this story wasn't even the spirit(s) but the way that her friends and coworkers so quickly and completely dismissed her as insane; immediately she was one of ""them"" and not the person they had worked alongside for years.  To me, the greatest source of angst came from her sudden invisibility as a human being.  But there is a generous measure of moody terror, and the stark, quiet grayness of the prison halls at night time proved a very effective setting for dread.  I was able to feel the chill of the place sitting on my couch at home very nicely.  Thumbs up to the director!I can just hear those voices now, complaining that there were some cliches and predictable plot elements.  Honestly, I have seen my share of thrillers--I really did not see the plot twist coming.  That's a testament to the well-crafted nature of this story.  As for cliches, well, nighttime settings with storms and dramatic lightening do make for good visual backdrops for horror films.  There's a reason those things became cliches, and that's because they work well. The use of these types of things are forgiveable in my book as long as the rest of the film is effectively done.Yes, other people's opinions are valuable, and other points of view can be enlightening.  But sometimes you just know your intuition is the right one even if everybody all around you is screaming the opposite. In this case I know I'm not crazy or stupid; Gothika is a worthy supernatural thriller for fans of the genre.  Don't let anybody tell you otherwise.-Andrea aka Merribelle",4,"Trust me, I'm not crazy.

What got me to finally watch it was the fact that I love Halle Berry. I could watch her in just about anything! In GOTHIKA, Miranda Grey (Ms. Berry) is a psychologist who has a head-on collision with the supernatural. On her way home from work (at Woodward Penitentiary for Women), she gets caught in a torrential rainstorm, is detoured, and almost hits a girl standing in the middle of the road. Miranda swerves around the girl and into a ditch. After climbing out of her car, she goes to the girl to make sure she's alright. The girl spontaneously catches fire and puts her flaming hands on Miranda, causing her to black out. Upon waking, Miranda finds herself incarcerated in the very penitentiary she works in, sedated, and accused of murdering her husband (Charles S. Dutton), who also happens to have been her boss. Things get really weird from here! Miranda is visited several times by the ghost-girl from the road and given clues to what's really going on. Can she put the pieces together before being tried for a murder she barely remembers? Robert Downey Jr. plays a subdued role as Miranda's doctor and former colleague. Penelope Cruz is Miranda's ex-patient turned fellow inmate, who has clues of her own to share. Why did Miranda kill her husband? How can she escape her prison in order to work out this mystery? The answers to these questions are the ice-cold backbone of this story. Bathed in darkness, rain, and blue-filtered light, Gothika wears it's forboding spirit on it's sleeve.

H. Berry's is a psychiatrist who, after a car accident caused by ghostly girl, awakes locked up in her own ward and blamed for her beloved husband's murder, which she obviously can't remember committing. As she struggles to remember (in a performance that makes you wonder about that `Berry' Oscar), horrid things start happening and the 'suspense' supposedly mounts. What mounts is our annoyance with the film, that boasts decent direction (which elevates &quot;Gothika&quot; above Dark Castle's previous sordid efforts like &quot;Ghost Ship&quot; and &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot;) and stylized sets - and everything else trying to live up to it...

'Gothica' remains dark and ominous throughout it's timeframe, delivering chills and jumps and skin crawling effects at a non-stop almost brutal pace, but when it all breaks down in the final frames I'm almost left a little bitter.  The film follows Miranda (Berry), a psychologist, as she's accused of murdering her husband and boss (Charles S. Dutton) and placed in the same asylum she works at.  Her workmate and friend (Downey Jr.) is trying to believe her story of ghosts and such but is finding that task very hard.  Why did she kill her husband and why is this bitter young girl, dead four years now, trying to hurt her?  The film, as I said, follows a breathtakingly brutal pace, giving you one spook after another, and even after all is revieled I was still, while slightly jaded, happy non-the-less in the fact that this film was actually scary, but the final frames, when Berry's charactor has to do the right thing and exact vengence it's just really lame.  Despite, up until the corny effects and lame ending it's still well worth the watch if not for the freak-factor that lines each frame like cobwebs line the frame of your house.  The acting is also a nice touch, especially since most horror films contain terrible actors, but the likes of Berry, Dutton, Downey Jr and Cruz are all top-notch, especially Cruz who embodies her role and really convinces you she's insane...or maybe not.

803248,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B0001FR3IG,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[1, 2]","With a title like Gothika, the brief descriptive blurb, and the haunting dark-blue tinted image of Halle Berry on the rear of the weekly TV schedule, I figured it merited a look.Miriam Gray is on her way home after a session with Chloe at the Woodward Penitentiary, a correctional facility for women.  Seems that Chloe is re-embellishing the images of being assaulted by her stepfather, by saying it is the devil who is doing this to her, and it burns.  Miriam is naturally skeptical, as Chloe is dragged away kicking and screaming.  Doug, head of the facility and Miriam's husband, explains it by use of of water splashed on a mirror.  The distorted image is how Chloe sees herself, but the psychiatrist is able to see the actual person, giving him/her the adventure.  That's what the viewer must decide in the omniscient view.  What is real and what is not?Innocuous beginning, right?  Cut three days later.  Miriam finds herself wearing a blue uniform, lying on a cot in a cell, with a glass door separating her from the hallway.  Horror of horrors, she realizes she is now an inmate of Woodward, and it befalls upon Peter Graham, a colleague who had an extramarital crush on her, to inform her that Doug has been murdered....by her!  Naturally, she is distraught, as she has no memory of the crime... but Peter thinks she is crazy, as the evidence points out she is guilty.  Chloe's words return to haunt her.  ""You can't trust anyone who thinks you're crazy.""  Not even Dr. Parsons, another colleague, can help her.She remembers going home to Doug, yet the last image we see of her was her discovering a strange blonde girl standing drenched in the rain, slash marks across her chest.  Could this have anything to do with her?Miriam discovers what it's like to be an inmate.  She is now nobody, and the viewer is given a shot of her from behind, the zip on her ill-fitting blue uniform unzipped.  The shower scene with all the woman isn't gratuitous as in those women in prison flicks of the 70's.  However, none of those movies ended up with the main character slashing her own arm from a hallucinatory illusion.This mixes the amnesia and flurry of images of Abre Los Ojos with the supernatural element of Ringu.  The jarring hallucinatory images come at a frenzy.  Some of them are bloody and violent, the rest involve the appearance of the blonde girl.  The movie is coded in the time old classic way--horrible things happen only in the darkly lit scenes.  Things begin to get weird when she is attacked by the girl, yet the guards watching the camera think she's trying to do herself in.  Hallucination or supernatural?  And what do the words ""Not Alone"" which she sees on the walls and even carved into her arm(!) mean?And some of the red herrings, the dramatic music that swells up, only to reveal... nothing, do get excessive, so it's as if a gallon of sweat dripped off the movie watcher for nothing.  The obligatory chase and escape sequences are somewhat predictable.The story and premise are intriguing despite the flaws.  Halle Berry does a laudable performance as Miriam, someone whose professional and personal life is put through the wringer and has to cope to get to the bottom of things and to determine if she really is sane.  But if anyone delivers a performance in this movie it is Penelope Cruz, who alas appears in only a few scenes, but what scenes!  After seeing her in Belle Epoque, Woman On Top, Captain Corelli's Mandolin, and Abre Los Ojos, her role as Chloe is a real change from romantic comedies or thrillers where she plays the romantic lead.  Her skin is a pasty white here, and in the beginning of the movie, her cropped hair, manic eyes, and broken words, are a real contrast from Pelagia in Corelli.

Dr. Miranda Grey (Halle Berry) is a psychiatrist at a prison for the mentally insane, and has her eye on a patient, who claims to be posessed by demons, or is the devil herself. After taking a much needed rest as a result of being overstressed and overworked, some bizarre incidents occur in Dr. Grey's life. When local law enforcement officials get wind of these occurrences, they suspect Dr. Grey's not just seeing things, and suspect her of murder. One such victim is Dr. Grey's husband, Dr. Scott Grey (Charles S. Dutton), who was working on a related case at the time of his ""disappearing act"". Several things happen all at once in ""Gothika"", where, even if you pay strictly close attention, you may not be able to tell if ""The Good Doctor"" committed these murders, or if she was having nightmarish dreams. The local law enforcement authorities put Miranda to the test, who appear to act as accusers rather than helpers of her situation. With law enforcement officials and various others on her back about the murders, Dr. Grey finds out she is ""NOT ALONE"", and desperately tries to escape this vicious cycle of occurrences, whether they're real or imaginary. By letting the viewer decide whether these muders existed or not, the people involved with the making of ""Gothika"" were extremely careful not to insult the viewer's intelligence. ""Gothika"" contains many theories concerning whether or why Dr. Grey caused these murders to take place, and gets seriously hurt in the process. With so many scary scenes featured here and there, it's hard to prevent a climactic scene grom showing its' fully orchestrated colors. To make certain characters appear samey, it's as if the film's makeup artists were trying to make Halle Berry appear more caucasian, thus, making her to be a mirror image to some of the subjects featured in the storyline, which suggest the characters may be remnants of Miranda's past life, who may be coming back to haunt her. So, the answer to some burning questions, is why are these sprits making Miranda pay, and, if so, what is their motive for doing so? One such question that needs to be answered, is: Was it real, or was it all just a bad dream gone awry? To find the answer, just go and see ""Gothika"" for yourself. After you've eaten your holiday turkey (or ham, if you prefer), prepare to get the ""stuffing"" scared out of you.

While it is more in line with being a thriller than a horror flick, it is nevertheless pretty creepy and is sure to be a fun & macabre date movie.The film stars Halle Berry and Penelope Cruz as two inmates of a woman's mental institution.  Both women are normally quite attractive, but the film does a credible job of dumbing down their beauty to make them look like authentic prisoners.  In fact, there were times I could barely believe that Cruz was the same girl who starred in WOMEN ON TOP.Berry plays a woman who had previously been a shrink at the institution.  That is to say, until she flipped out and killed her hubby.  As to WHY she went homocidal is the crux of the plot.[As a sidenote, for those who would enjoy watching a psychologist humbled and getting psycho-analzyed herself, this DVD might be worth it JUST for that aspect alone!]The best parts of this movie are the sets.  You don't see the sunshine the entire movie and the grey, dark & morose timbre of the film makes the prison complex seem like something straight out of Dante's INFERNO.  They do a good job of creating an eerie feeling that pervades the entire story.One final note:  while one of the reasons this film is categorized as ""R"" is that there is nudity, keep in mind that there is none.  Halle Berry has taken her clothes off in other flicks (SWORDFISH, MONSTER'S BALL) but not this one.

The cause: a naked blonde girl who promptly bursts into flames.When Miranda wakes up, she's locked in a cell in the mental hospital, and is told by her friend Pete (Robert Downey Jr.) that she murdered her beloved husband Doug (Charles S. Dutton). Now she's being held for observation while the police investigate -- and before long, a spectral presence begins attacking her. Of course, nobody believes her.Miranda begins ineptly trying to puzzle out what the ghost is trying to communicate to her, and why it possessed her so that it could murder Doug. All she has to go on is a mysterious tattoo of a burning woman, and the story of a doctor's dead daughter. But if Miranda figures out what happened to the ghost, she might end up in even more danger.There is literally nothing about ""Gothika"" that works -- it fails as a murder mystery, it fails as a thriller, it fails as a ghost story, and it fails COMPLETELY as a horror movie. Swimming pools? Not scary. Thunderstorms? Not scary. Empty hallways? Not scary. Tossing your head and screaming? Not scary. Halle Berry's hair? Well... maybe a little scary.The script feels like it went through a dozen rewrites, leaving it with little internal logic. For instance, he ghost seems to be acting at random -- she swings between guiding Miranda and trying to kill her. The dialogue is horribly trite (""I don't believe in ghosts."" ""Neither do I, but they believe in me"") and there are long scenes that seem to have no point. What is the point of Miranda escaping just so she can be caught again?It also has a downright weird attitude towards mental illness. Apparently being placed in a mental institution INSTANTLY causes you to act like a lunatic. Oh, and that traumatized woman who claims that Satan regularly rapes her? She's actually sane! Really!Halle Berry's performance is just wretched here -- she spends most of the movie thrashing, shrieking and running through empty corridors with no real goal. Miranda is also a thoroughly uninteresting character, and by the end we've discovered that she's also blindingly stupid. What kind of idiot INFORMS the killer that she knows his identity, especially when they're alone in the building?There are much better actors here, such as Bernard Hill, Penelope Cruz (who just sits around talking about demon rape) and Robert Downey Jr. (who clearly took this role because he was just out of rehab). Downey's character is also hinted to have a brewing romance with Berry, but for some reason it never amounts to anything -- he's just sort of there, with no real purpose.""Gothika"" is a complete failure in every way. Even a talented cast and an interesting premise can't save this movie from the abysmal writing and direction.",1,Locked in the loony bin,1365984000,"04 15, 2013",2013,3306,"['Gothika', 'one', 'movies', 'everything', 'wrong', 'ghost', 'story', 'wrong', 'murder', 'mystery', 'wrong', 'Even', 'title', 'wrong.And', 'promising', 'premise', 'ghastly', 'movie', 'dives', 'headfirst', 'sea', 'bland', 'cliches', 'promptly', 'drowns', 'plot', 'insane', 'self-devouring', 'plot', 'hole', 'partly', 'ghost', 'act', 'completely', 'random', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'embarrassingly', 'bad', 'performance', 'not', 'wholly', 'fault.Dr', 'Miranda', 'Grey', 'Berry', 'way', 'home', 'job', 'mental', 'hospital', 'when', 'nasty', 'car', 'crash', 'cause', 'naked', 'blonde', 'girl', 'who', 'promptly', 'flames.When', 'Miranda', 'up', 'locked', 'cell', 'mental', 'hospital', 'told', 'friend', 'Pete', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'murdered', 'beloved', 'husband', 'Doug', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Dutton', 'Now', 'being', 'held', 'observation', 'police', 'investigate', 'long', 'spectral', 'presence', 'attacking', 'course', 'nobody', 'her.Miranda', 'begins', 'ineptly', 'trying', 'puzzle', 'out', 'what', 'ghost', 'trying', 'communicate', 'why', 'possessed', 'so', 'could', 'murder', 'Doug', 'go', 'mysterious', 'tattoo', 'burning', 'woman', 'story', 'doctor', 'dead', 'daughter', 'Miranda', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'ghost', 'might', 'end', 'up', 'even', 'more', 'danger.There', 'literally', 'nothing', 'Gothika', 'murder', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'ghost', 'story', 'COMPLETELY', 'horror', 'movie', 'Swimming', 'pools', 'Not', 'scary', 'Thunderstorms', 'Not', 'scary', 'Empty', 'hallways', 'Not', 'scary', 'Tossing', 'head', 'screaming', 'Not', 'scary', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'hair', 'Well', 'maybe', 'little', 'scary.The', 'script', 'feels', 'went', 'dozen', 'rewrites', 'leaving', 'little', 'internal', 'logic', 'instance', 'ghost', 'be', 'acting', 'random', 'swings', 'guiding', 'Miranda', 'trying', 'kill', 'dialogue', 'horribly', 'trite', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ghosts', 'do', 'believe', 'are', 'long', 'scenes', 'seem', 'have', 'point', 'What', 'point', 'Miranda', 'escaping', 'just', 'can', 'be', 'caught', 'again', 'also', 'downright', 'weird', 'attitude', 'towards', 'mental', 'illness', 'Apparently', 'being', 'placed', 'mental', 'institution', 'INSTANTLY', 'act', 'lunatic', 'Oh', 'traumatized', 'woman', 'who', 'Satan', 'regularly', 'actually', 'sane', 'Really', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'performance', 'just', 'wretched', 'here', 'most', 'movie', 'thrashing', 'shrieking', 'running', 'empty', 'corridors', 'real', 'goal', 'Miranda', 'also', 'thoroughly', 'uninteresting', 'character', 'end', ""'ve"", 'discovered', 'also', 'blindingly', 'stupid', 'What', 'kind', 'idiot', 'INFORMS', 'killer', 'identity', 'especially', 'when', ""'re"", 'alone', 'building', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'actors', 'here', 'such', 'Bernard', 'Hill', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'who', 'just', 'around', 'talking', 'demon', 'rape', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'who', 'clearly', 'took', 'role', 'was', 'just', 'rehab', 'Downey', 'character', 'also', 'hinted', 'have', 'brewing', 'romance', 'Berry', 'reason', 'never', 'anything', 'just', 'sort', 'there', 'real', 'purpose', 'Gothika', 'complete', 'failure', 'way', 'Even', 'talented', 'cast', 'interesting', 'premise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'movie', 'abysmal', 'writing', 'direction']",N/A

The best part about the movie were the preformances, which to tell to the truth saved the movie. Yes, the movie was scary. There was at least two parts in this movie that made me actually jump, but sometimes just a couple of jumps can not make a movie be good. I had those other critics that judge a movie because it is stupid and does not focus on story and just the power to scare people. But I really think that was what this movie did. I guessed the ending before it happened, and during the scene where we learn about the ending, it was made pretty clear what was about to happen. I only wish that mabye they could have made the ending a little more of a surprise.Halle Barry was the star of ""Gothika."" In it she works at a prison for women. She is currently working to help Chloe who murdered her stepfather, and claims that she was raped by The Devil. One night she says goodbye to her husband/boss Doug, and is walked to her car by co-worker Pete. On the way home she learns from Sherrif Bob that the road ahead of her is closed, and while taking a detour home by passing a bridge, she sees this young girl standing in the middle of the road. She gets out of the car, and the young girl goes on fire, and Miranda blanks out.Three Days Later...Miranda wakes up in the very prision that she works in. Only she is an inmate. She talks to Pete and finds out that she has been accused of brutally murdering Doug. She has no clue what happened after the problem on the bridge and nobody believes what happened including her now fellow inmate Chloe, because everybody thinks that she is crazy. Everything that she did to the people that she studied is no happening to her. Miranda is getting a taste of her own medicine. One night however she wakes up and finds a creepy message being written on the fog on the glass of her cell.""NOT ALONE!""Miranda gets scared, and when the girl from the bridge begins appearing in the prison cell and beating her up, Miranda  knows that she must escape the prison cell and find out what is going on, only what she finds out she might never want to know because it affects her in two ways...on an emotional level and on a very very personal level.""Gothika,"" was a scary movie, yes. But sometimes just being scared in a horror movie doesn't work out. You have to be interested. I hate horror movies where you know what is going to happen. That was the problem with ""28 Days Later,"" it was veyr predictable. I really liked horror films this year like ""Darkness Falls,"" because I never saw anything like that before. ""Gothika,"" was very much like ""Dreamcatcher."" I only gave ""Dreamcatcher,"" two stars but that also had a cheap storyline. I wish they would make more horror movies instead of focusing on being scared every three seconds. Horror movies can also have a great storyline, which is what ""Gothika"" doesn't have.

Yet, this movie didn't come off as sincere. It was as though the director (Mathieu Kassovitz) didn't have much faith in the strength of his screenplay, which had a pretty good story.So, Kassovitz and Silver piled every single computer-generated special effect they could, in order to wow the viewer. But, instead of wowing me, seeing the endless 360-degree tilt-o-whirl pans and ghostly apparitions fading in and out only threw the movie's timing off. It was distracting, and worse, made it easier to predict what was going to happen next, thus taking an above-average script and sacrificing it to CGI animated fluff.Then, about a week later, I found out why. On television, TBS was broadcasting a movie with a nearly identical plot and theme, even down to the MacGuffins. However, this movie -- ""What Lies Beneath,"" directed by Robert Zemeckis in 2000, three years before ""Gothika"" -- relied on simple exposition and dialogue and montage more so than special effects to get its story across. I thus understood: ""Gothika"" needed a large measure of visual camouflage to shroud the fact that it was a warmed-over remake of a much better movie.So, go, and see the much better movie. Rent ""What Lies Beneath"" tonight. Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer are excellent in it and Zemeckis has been around long enough to know that the technical wizardry that worked so well in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" would be superfluous to a serious thriller.",2,Style Over Substance,1102204800,"12 5, 2004",2004,1812,"['Somewhere', 'skin', 'Gothika', 'slick', 'movie', 'produced', 'Joel', 'Silver', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'slipping', 'flick', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'up', 'standards', 'Demolition', 'Man', 'Predator', 'movie', 'heart', 'soul.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'actors', 'performances', 'are', 'solid', 'board', 'soundtrack', 'riveting', 'photography', 'gorgeous', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'sincere', 'was', 'director', 'Mathieu', 'Kassovitz', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'faith', 'strength', 'screenplay', 'had', 'pretty', 'good', 'story.So', 'Kassovitz', 'Silver', 'piled', 'single', 'computer-generated', 'special', 'effect', 'could', 'order', 'wow', 'viewer', 'instead', 'wowing', 'seeing', 'endless', '360-degree', 'tilt-o-whirl', 'pans', 'ghostly', 'apparitions', 'fading', 'only', 'threw', 'movie', 'timing', 'off', 'was', 'distracting', 'worse', 'made', 'easier', 'predict', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'thus', 'taking', 'above-average', 'script', 'sacrificing', 'CGI', 'animated', 'fluff.Then', 'week', 'later', 'found', 'out', 'why', 'television', 'TBS', 'was', 'broadcasting', 'movie', 'nearly', 'identical', 'plot', 'theme', 'even', 'down', 'MacGuffins', 'However', 'movie', 'What', 'Beneath', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', '2000', 'three', 'years', 'Gothika', 'relied', 'simple', 'exposition', 'dialogue', 'montage', 'more', 'so', 'special', 'effects', 'get', 'story', 'thus', 'understood', 'Gothika', 'needed', 'large', 'measure', 'visual', 'camouflage', 'shroud', 'fact', 'was', 'warmed-over', 'remake', 'much', 'better', 'movie.So', 'go', 'see', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'Rent', 'What', 'Beneath', 'tonight', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'are', 'excellent', 'Zemeckis', 'been', 'long', 'enough', 'know', 'technical', 'wizardry', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'would', 'be', 'superfluous', 'serious', 'thriller']",N/A

It's a dark rainy night, thunder rumbles and lightning flashes, illuminating a state prison for the criminally insane, which looks more like Dracula's Transylvanian castle than a mental institution for women. Director Mathieu Kassovitz gives us damsels in distress, along with paranormal activity and something...or someone very evil...lurking. Brrrrr. Ok, so Kassovitz uses so many horror cliches the movie becomes campy - but it is better than most scary films I have seen recently, and it is certainly entertaining.Halle Berry plays respected psychiatrist Miranda Grey, who works at the above prison. Her husband, (Charles S. Dutton), also a psychiatrist, runs the place. While driving home one dark, rainy night, (wherever this city is, the sun doesn't shine much), she is forced to take an out-of-the-way detour. She sees a young woman, bruised and partially clothed, standing in the middle of the isolated road and swerves to miss hitting her. Dr. Grey gets out of the car to assist the girl and then the real weirdness begins. Miranda wakes up three days later in the same institution where she works, but she is in a hospital gown, locked in a cell - a prisoner, not a doctor - and accused of the violent murder of her husband. She has amnesia and remembers nothing after seeing the girl in the rain. Her fingerprints are all over the murder weapon, her bloodyhand prints are on the wall, along with the written words &quot;NOT ALONE,&quot; and the murder weapon is covered with her prints also. Could this rational, professional woman who loved her husband have murdered him? No matter what other reviewers say, I had fun watching this flick - and was even scared, at times. I'm a pretty good sleuth too, and I didn't catch on for a while.There is overacting here....and some under-acting too. As a screamer, Hallie doesn't disappoint - but it's a scary movie, right? Penelope Cruz plays Chloe, one of Miranda's disturbed patients who becomes a fellow inmate. She has few lines of note, and what lines she has are barely audible. Robert Downey, Jr. plays Miranda's colleague Dr Pete Graham, who definitely listened to her more before she became a patient. The script bogs down at times and becomes a bit muddled.

Besides, my Mom, a former prison psychiatrist, wanted to see it.Berry plays Dr. Miranda Grey, a shrink on the staff of a women's penitentiary that has all the ambience of a Transylvanian castle. Driving home on a dark and stormy night - hey, is there any other kind in this genre? - Miranda swerves into a ditch to miss a young woman standing in the road. Upon asking the near-victim if she's OK, Miranda observes that she's been physically abused. Then, the woman undergoes spontaneous combustion. Miranda next wakes up to find herself an inmate on her own psycho ward, under arrest for chopping her husband (Charles Dutton) up into little pieces, and in the care of a former colleague (Robert Downey, Jr.).Berry's performance makes the film great fun to watch despite a preposterous storyline that, at the end, had me saying &quot;Yeah, but ...&quot; about too much of what I'd seen. And the set designers weren't at all subtle in their use of flickering lights, shadows, and general gloominess. I had to check to see if I'd inadvertently left my sunglasses on for the show. Perhaps the prison was economizing on the use of electricity after being forced into the California Plan. Really scary stuff is sometimes more effective in full daylight because it's less expected.Penelope Cruz, another hottie in my book, appears as Chloe Sava, an inmate accused of cutting her stepfather's throat, and who claims to being repeatedly raped by the devil in her prison cell. While this is a clue to the endgame, it added nothing to the plot's credibility. In retrospect, it was just another &quot;Huh?&quot; that defies understanding if you think about it too much.Downey's performance was unremarkable, and his Dr. Graham character serves only as straight man to Miranda's more frenetic moments.GOTHIKA is a chilling ride on which Halle Berry is pretty much the only driver.

By the time I followed up the film must have left theaters making me think it was not well received. I subsequently saw the DVD and thought it was an interesting film making several well taken points along its fanciful way concerning the advantage that can be taken of the loss of credibility of mental patients as witnesses to a true crime.The tale was a ghost story, but never entirely clear about what was real and what was imagined since we watched it through the eyes of a person believed to be criminally insane. Visually, I felt it had good atmosphere, was well filmed, nicely acted out, and rapidly paced leaving no time for looking back. The sets for the mental institution were also visually very effective, convincing and frightening. There were enough blinking lights filmed to throw many people into a seizure (and give me a headache) which also added to the viewers feeling of being on edge and disoriented.

One stormy night she leaves for home after work when she is forced to take a detour via a deserted road where she nearly runs into a girl standing in the middle of the road. Dr Grey swerves to avoid her, and instead crashes into a tree. She appears okay but rushes to check on the girl, who then self immolates in front of her eyes.Dr Grey then wakes up to find herself as a patient in her very own hospital. She's been accused of murdering her husband,  but cannot recall the events leading up to her institutionalisation. The story then focuses on her struggle to regain her memories, prove her sanity, and escape from this institution.Director Mathieu Kassovitz (Crimson Rivers) adopts a high-tech look for the whole film, with some shots occasionally looking too much like music video footage. However, overall he does deliver a fairly stylish film with perhaps more emphasis on the thriller aspect rather than horror, though this film very much follows a supernatural storyline. Unfortunately many of the film's 'moments' are telegraphed to the viewer either through the dialogue or lead up sequences.However, the film is lent some weight by some good performances, especially from Halle and a smaller role from Penelope Cruz as a fellow patient, though this is very much a vehicle for Berry.",3,So-so!,1103760000,"12 23, 2004",2004,1482,"['psychiatrist', 'Dr', 'Miranda', 'Grey', 'played', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'somewhat', ""'gothic"", 'looking', 'psychiatric', 'institution', 'run', 'husband', 'Dr', 'Douglas', 'Grey', 'played', 'Charles', 'Dutton', 'One', 'stormy', 'night', 'home', 'work', 'when', 'forced', 'take', 'detour', 'deserted', 'road', 'where', 'nearly', 'girl', 'standing', 'middle', 'road', 'Dr', 'Grey', 'avoid', 'instead', 'crashes', 'tree', 'okay', 'rushes', 'check', 'girl', 'who', 'then', 'self', 'immolates', 'front', 'eyes.Dr', 'Grey', 'then', 'up', 'find', 'patient', 'very', 'own', 'hospital', 'been', 'accused', 'murdering', 'husband', 'can', 'not', 'recall', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'institutionalisation', 'story', 'then', 'struggle', 'regain', 'memories', 'prove', 'sanity', 'escape', 'institution.Director', 'Mathieu', 'Kassovitz', 'Crimson', 'Rivers', 'high-tech', 'look', 'whole', 'film', 'shots', 'occasionally', 'looking', 'too', 'much', 'music', 'video', 'footage', 'However', 'overall', 'deliver', 'fairly', 'stylish', 'film', 'perhaps', 'more', 'emphasis', 'thriller', 'aspect', 'rather', 'horror', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'supernatural', 'storyline', 'Unfortunately', 'many', 'film', ""'moments"", 'are', 'telegraphed', 'viewer', 'dialogue', 'lead', 'up', 'sequences.However', 'film', 'lent', 'weight', 'good', 'performances', 'especially', 'Halle', 'smaller', 'role', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'fellow', 'patient', 'very', 'much', 'vehicle', 'Berry']",N/A

Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[11, 13]","This was one of those movies that somehow, I'd never even heard of it when it was in the theaters but when strolling through a DVD store one day and seeing Halle Berry on a cover, it immediately drew my attention to this great movie.  That being said, this is a fairly good psychological/super natural type thriller that doesn't suffer greatly from the predictability factor and in general entertains from the first scene to the last with some seriously intriguing twists.Performance wise, Halle Berry definitely gives and outstanding performance in this film showing a range of acting I'd previously not thought her capable of.  Everybody's favorite addict in Robert Downey Jr. performs well in this movie albeit a somewhat subdued role for him in comparison to previous roles I've seen him in.  Charles S. Dutton's role in this film is fairly limited which unfortunately doesn't give him much opportunity to show off his talents.  Penelope Cruz's performance is fairly limited in this film as well!This is the first film directed by Mathieu Kassovitz that I've watched and I would definitely have to say that his films may be ones to watch out for as this film is presented in a wonderful manner from beginning to end.The Premise:Halle Berry plays criminal psychologist Dr. Miranda Grey who works at Woodward Penitentiary for Women.  She appears to be a highly respected employee at the prison and is married to her boss, Dr. Douglas Grey (Charles S. Dutton).  Not long after leaving work and heading home in a storm she nearly runs someone over in the middle of the road and has an accident...  She wakes up a few days later to find that she's now a patient in the penitentiary that she worked in and she's been accused of killing her own husband...What follows from there is a well made psychological/super natural thriller that will, as stated above, entertain from the very first scene to the last as the story is extremely well scripted, directed and played out by the actors.  I highly recommend this film to any and all who enjoy films in this genre!  {ssintrepid}Special Features:-Commentary by Director Mathieu Kassovitz and Director of Photography Matthew Libatique-Limp Bizkit &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; Music Video",5,Gothika - A very entertaining film!,1082505600,"04 21, 2004",2004,2230,"['was', 'one', 'movies', 'somehow', ""'d"", 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'when', 'was', 'theaters', 'when', 'strolling', 'DVD', 'store', 'one', 'day', 'seeing', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'cover', 'immediately', 'drew', 'attention', 'great', 'movie', 'being', 'said', 'fairly', 'good', 'natural', 'type', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'greatly', 'predictability', 'factor', 'general', 'entertains', 'first', 'scene', 'last', 'seriously', 'intriguing', 'twists.Performance', 'wise', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'definitely', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'film', 'showing', 'range', 'acting', ""'d"", 'previously', 'not', 'thought', 'capable', 'Everybody', 'favorite', 'addict', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'performs', 'well', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'subdued', 'role', 'comparison', 'previous', 'roles', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Dutton', 'role', 'film', 'fairly', 'limited', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'opportunity', 'show', 'off', 'talents', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'performance', 'fairly', 'limited', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'film', 'directed', 'Mathieu', 'Kassovitz', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'would', 'definitely', 'have', 'say', 'films', 'may', 'be', 'ones', 'watch', 'out', 'film', 'presented', 'wonderful', 'manner', 'beginning', 'end.The', 'Premise', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'criminal', 'psychologist', 'Dr.', 'Miranda', 'Grey', 'who', 'Woodward', 'Penitentiary', 'Women', 'be', 'highly', 'respected', 'employee', 'prison', 'married', 'boss', 'Dr.', 'Douglas', 'Grey', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Dutton', 'Not', 'long', 'leaving', 'work', 'heading', 'home', 'storm', 'nearly', 'someone', 'middle', 'road', 'accident', 'up', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'find', 'now', 'patient', 'penitentiary', 'worked', 'been', 'accused', 'killing', 'own', 'husband', 'What', 'well', 'made', 'natural', 'thriller', 'will', 'stated', 'entertain', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'last', 'story', 'extremely', 'well', 'scripted', 'directed', 'played', 'out', 'actors', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'who', 'enjoy', 'films', 'genre', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', '-Commentary', 'Director', 'Mathieu', 'Kassovitz', 'Director', 'Photography', 'Matthew', 'Libatique-Limp', 'Bizkit', 'quot', 'Behind', 'Blue', 'Eyes', 'quot', 'Music', 'Video']",N/A
803303,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001FR3IG,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","""Gothika"" is one of those movies that is not as bad as you heard that it was, although certainly it has some major problems. For one thing the movie tries so relentlessly to be eerie with all the spooky lighting and music that it threatens to be carried along by the style rather than the substance. Then there is the fact that we know that in the ""real world"" a prison psychiatrist is not going to end up in the same prison where they practiced if the world decides that they are insane. Doing so would mess up the treatment of every patient she had been working with, so we know that Halle Berry's Miranda Grey is there for a reason, which gets us thinking ahead of the plot and trying to figure out whodunnit. Is director Mathieu Kassovitz being so heavy handed that he is obvious or is he skillfully setting up a red herring? Good question. You can answer it for yourself after you see the film.Miranda is a psychiatrist in a dark and dreary prison where we are introduced to her as she is working with patient Chloe Sava (Penelope Cruz). Miranda seems clinical and cool, if not cold. One of the other staff psychiatrists, Pete Graham (Robert Downey Jr.) seems interested in her, but she has recently wed her boss, Dr. Douglas Grey (Charles S. Dutton). That night, after taking a swim in the prison pool, she drives home during a thunderstorm and is forced to take a detour. The figure of a ghostly girl appears in the middle of the road and Miranda crashes her car. Miranda tries to help the girl, who looks like she has been the victim of something horrible, but then the girl bursts into flames. The next thing Miranda knows she wakes up a prisoner in her own institution where she is told by Pete that she has been accused of brutally murdering her husband with an axe. Miranda remembers nothing.Chloe explains to Miranda that once you are declared to be officially insane anything you say will automatically be considered to be the ravings of a lunatic. Miranda is put in the impossible position of convincing her captors that she is sane. However, that is really not much of a problem because she is so distraught and confused that she convinces both herself and the viewers that maybe she is insane, and if that is true, then maybe it is true that she killed her husband. Berry's performance bounces back and forth between screaming hysteria and a guarded detachment in an effort to survive everything that is being thrown at her by not only the authorities trying to convict her of murder but also of her own mind. For those that thought Berry's Oscar for ""Monster's Ball"" did not prove she was a real actress, ""Gothika"" proves she is clearly more than a pretty face.There is a paradox in this film, what some may consider a fatal flaw, in that in the final analysis all of the pieces do not fit. Even once you know what is going on it does not really explain everything that is happening. Watch the film a second time and you will see this is clearly the case. However I think this was really more a question of keeping us guessing rather than having problems with story construction. Kassovitz and screenwriter Sebastian Gutierrez are developing a sense of mystery and terror that literally extends to the end of the film where the final scene provides another piece of what is really an unfinished puzzle. Listen to Kassovitz's commentary on this DVD and he will repeatedly talk about what they did to make individual scenes scary, without a clear regard for what it meant for the logic of the film. Either you buy into the end result or this movie is going to grossly offend you. There probably is not going to be any middle ground on this one.Final Note: Kassovitz earns points by filming a group shower scene with Berry, Cruz, and over a dozen other women that is totally in keeping with the atmosphere of the film. These women are all naked, but the scene is filmed in such a way that they are not nude (that will make sense when you see it). When that scene started I was mentally rolling my eyes at what I thought was going to be coming up next and Kassovitz simply did not go there. In a world of gratuitous sex and violence, the way he presented this scene was something to see.",4,This ghost story puts Halle Berry through the wringer,1144972800,"04 14, 2006",2006,4201,"['Gothika', 'one', 'movies', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'heard', 'was', 'certainly', 'major', 'problems', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'so', 'relentlessly', 'be', 'eerie', 'spooky', 'lighting', 'music', 'be', 'carried', 'style', 'rather', 'substance', 'Then', 'fact', 'know', 'real', 'world', 'prison', 'psychiatrist', 'not', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'same', 'prison', 'where', 'practiced', 'world', 'are', 'insane', 'Doing', 'so', 'would', 'mess', 'up', 'treatment', 'patient', 'had', 'been', 'working', 'know', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Miranda', 'Grey', 'there', 'reason', 'thinking', 'ahead', 'plot', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'whodunnit', 'director', 'Mathieu', 'Kassovitz', 'being', 'so', 'heavy', 'handed', 'obvious', 'skillfully', 'setting', 'up', 'red', 'herring', 'Good', 'question', 'can', 'answer', 'see', 'film.Miranda', 'psychiatrist', 'dark', 'dreary', 'prison', 'where', 'are', 'introduced', 'working', 'patient', 'Chloe', 'Sava', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Miranda', 'clinical', 'cool', 'not', 'cold', 'One', 'other', 'staff', 'psychiatrists', 'Pete', 'Graham', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'interested', 'recently', 'wed', 'boss', 'Dr.', 'Douglas', 'Grey', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Dutton', 'night', 'taking', 'swim', 'prison', 'pool', 'home', 'thunderstorm', 'forced', 'take', 'detour', 'figure', 'ghostly', 'girl', 'middle', 'road', 'Miranda', 'car', 'Miranda', 'help', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'victim', 'something', 'horrible', 'then', 'girl', 'flames', 'next', 'thing', 'Miranda', 'up', 'prisoner', 'own', 'institution', 'where', 'told', 'Pete', 'been', 'accused', 'brutally', 'murdering', 'husband', 'axe', 'Miranda', 'remembers', 'nothing.Chloe', 'explains', 'Miranda', 'once', 'are', 'declared', 'be', 'officially', 'insane', 'anything', 'say', 'will', 'automatically', 'be', 'considered', 'be', 'ravings', 'lunatic', 'Miranda', 'put', 'impossible', 'position', 'convincing', 'captors', 'sane', 'However', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'problem', 'so', 'distraught', 'confused', 'viewers', 'maybe', 'insane', 'true', 'then', 'maybe', 'true', 'killed', 'husband', 'Berry', 'performance', 'bounces', 'back', 'forth', 'screaming', 'hysteria', 'guarded', 'detachment', 'effort', 'survive', 'everything', 'being', 'thrown', 'not', 'only', 'authorities', 'trying', 'convict', 'murder', 'also', 'own', 'mind', 'thought', 'Berry', 'Oscar', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'did', 'not', 'prove', 'was', 'real', 'actress', 'Gothika', 'clearly', 'more', 'pretty', 'paradox', 'film', 'what', 'may', 'consider', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'final', 'analysis', 'pieces', 'do', 'not', 'fit', 'Even', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'not', 'really', 'explain', 'everything', 'happening', 'Watch', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'will', 'see', 'clearly', 'case', 'However', 'think', 'was', 'really', 'more', 'question', 'keeping', 'guessing', 'rather', 'having', 'problems', 'story', 'construction', 'Kassovitz', 'screenwriter', 'Sebastian', 'Gutierrez', 'are', 'developing', 'sense', 'mystery', 'terror', 'literally', 'end', 'film', 'where', 'final', 'scene', 'piece', 'what', 'really', 'unfinished', 'puzzle', 'Listen', 'Kassovitz', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'will', 'repeatedly', 'talk', 'what', 'did', 'make', 'individual', 'scenes', 'scary', 'clear', 'regard', 'what', 'meant', 'logic', 'film', 'buy', 'end', 'result', 'movie', 'going', 'grossly', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'middle', 'ground', 'one.Final', 'Note', 'Kassovitz', 'points', 'filming', 'group', 'shower', 'scene', 'Berry', 'Cruz', 'dozen', 'other', 'women', 'totally', 'keeping', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'women', 'are', 'naked', 'scene', 'filmed', 'such', 'way', 'are', 'not', 'nude', 'will', 'make', 'sense', 'when', 'see', 'When', 'scene', 'started', 'was', 'mentally', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'coming', 'up', 'next', 'Kassovitz', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'there', 'world', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'violence', 'way', 'presented', 'scene', 'was', 'something', 'see']",N/A

Halle Berry, playing Miranda Grey, is struggling to know whether she has suddenly become insane, or whether something else is going on. It takes her a while, but eventually she realizes that, as improbable as it seems, a ghost is haunting her.Miranda Grey is a psychiatrist. She deals with people who behave strangely and often have a hard time dealing with reality. She drives home one day and encounters a girl in the road, but her encounter is weird. The next thing we know, Miranda is waking up in a hospital, accused of murdering her husband. The next portion of the movie is designed to make you confused, mirroring Miranda's own confusion. Who really killed Miranda's husband? Why was Miranda's husband killed? Is there really a ghost or is Miranda insane? Why does the ghost keep writing ""Not Alone?""The movie does plod a bit, but the plodding is intended to give you time to think about the movie and what is happening, allowing you to add to your own confusion. It takes about half the movie for the viewer to become convinced that a ghost really haunts Miranda, which is about the time that Miranda herself realizes that she is being haunted. Once Miranda catches on that the ghost wants her to do something, then the movie enters a whole new phase. Fortunately the ghost is working with her to help answer all the questions that the viewer asks in the first half of the movie, including what I thought was a chilling ending that I did not see coming.Portions of the movie are predictable, and we are left with a plot hole big enough to drive a bus through, but I still found the movie enjoyable and would recommend it to people who like horror movies that make you think. Even if you find the ending predictable, then you can pat yourself on the back about how well you figured it all out from the clues sprinkled throughout the movie.

But I fell for the name and expected something in the spooky monster genre.  Of course I also fell for the Halle Berry name, so maybe I would have rented it anyway.  Whatever the reason, what I didn't expect was a 'psychologist gets locked up in a mental institution under suspicion of chopping her husband into little bits' film.  I like procedural thrillers much more than I like psychological thrillers.But, something happened on the way to the plot, and the more I watched, the more I liked what I saw.  You see, there's a ghost.  One who is trying to get Miranda (Berry) to do something, but has nearly destroyed the brilliant psychologist in the process.  There are quite a few plot turns before the climax.  No doubt you will guess some part of the resolution, but probably only because you will make many guesses and one has to be right.The film builds slowly as Miranda fights for her sanity and tries to convince people who were once her friends that she is not a cold blooded psychotic.  Red herrings are used to keep the viewer guessing and unprepared for the sudden rush of the last third of the film.  At this point Berry has screams, and you will have jumped, so many times that you will be in a somewhat stunned shock.Everybody in this film is spooky.  The most glaring fault is how the real story took place with no one noticing,  But that may very well be one of the points of the film.  Cinematography is excellent and really does capture the 'gothic' flavor hidden in a thoroughly modern institution set somewhere in rural America.  Berry's acting (and most of this film is Berry's acting) is really quite good considering the genre.This isn't a hack and slash film, but there are bloody bits.  It's a bit like a low key Silence of Lambs with a dash of Brian Lumley's early Necroscope novels.  Unfortunately, the film ends on a hook - a vague indication of sequels to come.

Won't somebody check those darn circuit breakers?  Halle Berry acts herself crazy (again, literally), but hey, Halle, lay off that Botox if you want some more facial expressions!

Did Halle imagine that girl on the road?  Oops! - remember ""What Lies Beneath?  I think it's the same girl!

Also, I loved the poster. It's very effective & yet, doesn't give anything away about the movie. Neither does the title. Which to me, would have been plus points towards the movie.

But the fact that she's super skinny in this was very distracting for me. She needs a good feeding, and if she turned sideways, and there was a crack in the floor, then she'd go straight through. Halle broke her arm filming a scene with Robert Downey Jr.. Downey was supposed to grab her arm and twist but twisted too hard and the arm snapped. Berry wore a cast during the rest of the filming, which is visible at times. Production was halted for eight weeks.The setting of the movie is extremely depressing, with no variation on the setting outside of the psychiatric hospital, apart from the occasional flashback. Some movies can pull this off, but when you're watching it in the dark, and not really getting it in the first place, then the rooms just merge into one, and you can't tell between the scenes.Roles also shift constantly throughout the movie. The crazy people seem normal, the normal people seem crazy, and the responsible people seem dangerous.

803324,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0001FR3IG,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[6, 7]","Gothika is the latest from Dark Castle Entertainment, specializing in horror movies with updated special effects, including House on Haunted Hill and Thir13en Ghosts, two of my favorites. So I wasn't expecting much, but I figured a movie like Gothika would be, well, gothic.  I was not disappointed.Miranda Grey (Halle Berry) is a monotone-voiced psychiatrist consulting with a patient (apparently, she only ever talks to one), Chloe Sava (Penelope Cruz), in a sanitarium. Chloe believes she is being raped by the devil in prison.  Miranda is the wife of Dr. Douglas Grey (Charles Dutton), a blubbery man that you can't believe is married to such a delicious package.  Doug is also the mental hospital's chief psychiatrist. When the two kiss, it's squeamishly unnerving-kudos to the director (Mathieu Kassovitz) for telegraphing the awful while filming something as mundane as a spousal embrace.Miranda works with another psychiatrist, Pete Graham (Robert Downey Jr.), a mumbly, ferret-like character who lusts for her from afar.  The three characters casually discuss psychological problems as if they were discussing the weather.  There's no warmth in any of the relationships, even though a storm rages in the background, crackling with thunder at appropriate moments.Then weird stuff happens. Miranda crashes her car in an effort to avoid running over a woman (Kathleen Mackey) she sees standing in the road.  The woman touches Miranda's face and the two burst into flames...Miranda wakes up in the same mental hospital she once worked at.  She's now a patient, accused of hacking her husband to death with an axe.  Pete is her psychiatrist.  And just like that, Miranda's world falls apart.The movie strains credibility with the absurd notion that Miranda would be placed in the very same mental facility that she worked at.  No effort is made to explain this particular plot point, so integral to the horror Miranda experiences.  Similarly, Miranda doesn't act particularly professional or even argue her case very well.  She collapses into a shrieking mess and pretty much stays that way throughout the film.Complicating matters is the ghost that haunts the facility.  In a refreshing horror movie turn, this is no Capser the Friendly Ghost.  She possesses people, she uses said possessed people to do awful things, and beats the crap out of anyone who doesn't do what she wants them to do.  In fact, she's so powerful and intrusive that you can't help but wonder why the ghost just doesn't do everything herself.Unfortunately, there are lots of problems with Gothika.  Halle Berry is too pretty for the role and lacks sufficient warmth to bring any real emotion to the screen but shrill hysteria.  Pete is so mush-mouthed, so wandering in his conversations, that he seems more like a patient than a doctor at the hospital.  But the real villain is the writer (Sebastian Gutierrez), who filled the plot with holes (security guards hand over their car keys to Miranda for WHAT reason exactly?), ridiculous punch lines (think Trinity from the Matrix's maxim ""Dodge this"" thrown into a movie that's supposed to be all about psychological horror), and awful dialogue.Gothika is one of those movies that is defined primarily by its lensing; everything is a bluish gray.  This is obviously intentional to set the mood of a dreary psychological horror. The relentless blue is punctuated by are occasional flashes of red-red lights, a red nametag, red outfits.  But unlike Sixth Sense, the red doesn't have any real symbolism behind it (except, perhaps, ""DANGER!"").  It's as if Kassovitz liked the idea of putting a blue lens over the film but didn't know what to do with the technique.And yet, Gothika has genuinely creepy moments that caused my various family members to jump out of their seats.  The horror, both of role reversal (the psychologist becomes the patient) and of the capacity of normal people to commit acts if horrible violence, is striking.  The insane asylum is its own character, a gaping series of hallways with wide-open spaces and cold glass walls.Gothika is no Sixth Sense or Stir of Echoes, and a little too slickly produced for its own good.  It's hampered by high-minded goals, burdened with a patchwork plot, and really, really blue.  But it's just scary enough, just freaky enough, and just interesting enough to make it worth watching.",2,"Just scary enough, freaky enough, and interesting to watch",1096156800,"09 26, 2004",2004,4364,"['Gothika', 'latest', 'Dark', 'Castle', 'Entertainment', 'specializing', 'horror', 'movies', 'updated', 'special', 'effects', 'including', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'Thir13en', 'Ghosts', 'two', 'favorites', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'figured', 'movie', 'Gothika', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'gothic', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed.Miranda', 'Grey', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'monotone-voiced', 'psychiatrist', 'consulting', 'patient', 'apparently', 'only', 'ever', 'talks', 'one', 'Chloe', 'Sava', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'sanitarium', 'Chloe', 'being', 'raped', 'devil', 'prison', 'Miranda', 'wife', 'Dr.', 'Douglas', 'Grey', 'Charles', 'Dutton', 'blubbery', 'man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'married', 'such', 'delicious', 'package', 'Doug', 'also', 'mental', 'hospital', 'chief', 'psychiatrist', 'When', 'two', 'kiss', 'squeamishly', 'unnerving-kudos', 'director', 'Mathieu', 'Kassovitz', 'telegraphing', 'awful', 'filming', 'something', 'as', 'mundane', 'spousal', 'embrace.Miranda', 'psychiatrist', 'Pete', 'Graham', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'mumbly', 'ferret-like', 'character', 'who', 'afar', 'three', 'characters', 'casually', 'discuss', 'psychological', 'problems', 'were', 'discussing', 'weather', 'warmth', 'relationships', 'even', 'storm', 'background', 'crackling', 'thunder', 'appropriate', 'moments.Then', 'weird', 'stuff', 'Miranda', 'car', 'effort', 'avoid', 'running', 'woman', 'Kathleen', 'Mackey', 'standing', 'road', 'woman', 'Miranda', 'face', 'two', 'burst', 'flames', 'Miranda', 'up', 'same', 'mental', 'hospital', 'once', 'worked', 'now', 'patient', 'accused', 'hacking', 'husband', 'death', 'axe', 'Pete', 'psychiatrist', 'just', 'Miranda', 'world', 'apart.The', 'movie', 'strains', 'credibility', 'absurd', 'notion', 'Miranda', 'would', 'be', 'placed', 'very', 'same', 'mental', 'facility', 'worked', 'effort', 'made', 'explain', 'particular', 'plot', 'point', 'so', 'integral', 'horror', 'Miranda', 'experiences', 'Similarly', 'Miranda', ""n't"", 'act', 'particularly', 'professional', 'even', 'argue', 'case', 'very', 'well', 'shrieking', 'mess', 'pretty', 'much', 'stays', 'way', 'film.Complicating', 'matters', 'ghost', 'facility', 'refreshing', 'horror', 'movie', 'turn', 'Capser', 'Friendly', 'Ghost', 'people', 'said', 'possessed', 'people', 'do', 'awful', 'things', 'crap', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'do', 'what', 'do', 'fact', 'so', 'powerful', 'intrusive', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'ghost', 'just', ""n't"", 'do', 'everything', 'herself.Unfortunately', 'are', 'lots', 'problems', 'Gothika', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'too', 'pretty', 'role', 'sufficient', 'warmth', 'bring', 'real', 'emotion', 'screen', 'shrill', 'hysteria', 'Pete', 'so', 'mush-mouthed', 'so', 'wandering', 'conversations', 'more', 'patient', 'doctor', 'hospital', 'real', 'villain', 'writer', 'Sebastian', 'Gutierrez', 'who', 'filled', 'plot', 'holes', 'security', 'guards', 'hand', 'car', 'keys', 'Miranda', 'WHAT', 'reason', 'exactly', 'ridiculous', 'punch', 'lines', 'think', 'Trinity', 'Matrix', 'maxim', 'Dodge', 'thrown', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'psychological', 'horror', 'awful', 'dialogue.Gothika', 'one', 'movies', 'defined', 'primarily', 'lensing', 'everything', 'bluish', 'gray', 'obviously', 'intentional', 'set', 'mood', 'dreary', 'psychological', 'horror', 'relentless', 'blue', 'punctuated', 'are', 'occasional', 'flashes', 'red-red', 'lights', 'red', 'nametag', 'red', 'outfits', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'red', ""n't"", 'have', 'real', 'symbolism', 'perhaps', 'DANGER', 'Kassovitz', 'liked', 'idea', 'putting', 'blue', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'technique.And', 'yet', 'Gothika', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'moments', 'caused', 'various', 'family', 'members', 'jump', 'seats', 'horror', 'role', 'reversal', 'psychologist', 'patient', 'capacity', 'normal', 'people', 'commit', 'acts', 'horrible', 'violence', 'striking', 'insane', 'asylum', 'own', 'character', 'gaping', 'series', 'hallways', 'wide-open', 'spaces', 'cold', 'glass', 'walls.Gothika', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'little', 'too', 'slickly', 'produced', 'own', 'good', 'hampered', 'high-minded', 'goals', 'burdened', 'patchwork', 'plot', 'really', 'really', 'blue', 'just', 'scary', 'enough', 'just', 'freaky', 'enough', 'just', 'interesting', 'enough', 'make', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

Driving home from work one night in the pouring rain, she veers to avoid a pedestrian who is standing the middle of the road. Miranda wakes up three days later to find herself confined to the same psychiatric ward where she used to work. Accused of murdering her husband and terrorized by violent hallucinations, she remembers nothing since her encounter with the pedestrian in the road.I have to give &quot;Gothika&quot; some credit. This supernatural thriller understands that isolation is the key to horror. Miranda Grey suffers the worst form of emotional isolation because she is considered insane. Her behavior is understood to be irrational and dangerous, ipso facto,  because she's crazy. -As opposed to her being considered crazy because of her behavior. Halle Berry is pretty convincing. Robert Downey, Jr. is underused as a fellow psychiatrist at the prison. Penelope Cruz is fine as a troubled inmate. But &quot;Gothika&quot; suffers from the most common horror film flaw: People do not behave as people actually would. The psychiatrists are utterly goofy. The plot is full of holes and implausible coincidences. But, director Mathieu Kassovitz has managed has created some real -if spotty- suspense nevertheless. &quot;Gothika&quot; isn't without entertainment value. It's a worthwhile rental if you're looking for something spooky and mindless.The DVD: Bonus features include a music video for &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; by Limp Bizkit and a solid audio commentary by director Mathieu Kassovitz and cinematographer Matthew Libatique.

They're uninspired, trite crowd-pleasers. Emphasis is placed on the gore and creepy atmosphere instead of the acting quality and polishing the plotline.Scripting is fair, if not somewhat raw, but Downey Jr.--as the skeptic shrink associate opposite Berry--(in this reviewer's opinion) could have shown a bit more skill.The secondary caracters, considering the compact amount of cellophane they were given, proved good stock characters, but that's the weakness, anyway. Berry reveals her intriguing versatility as the misunderstood psychologist, Miranda Grey, proving a great upcoming role before her plummet into the calamity of 'Catwoman.'One can be thankful, to say the least, that an excellent score, masterfully crafted by the one and only John Ottman, boldfaces and holds true to the [overdrawn] haunting themes--a surprise, considering he previously scored Halloween H*20 in '98.On the whole, though folks, we can thank God (and Kassovitz, for that matter) that the gore was kept at a somewhat minimal level, remaining a suspense/drama flick and not insulted to the horror genre at Berry's expense.

803328,A1E15WYG9C47X1,B0001FR3IG,"""mobby_uk""","[14, 17]","I was really looking forward to watching and liking Gothika, since I enjoy good ghost stories on one hand, and have a soft spot for French directors in general on the other. And being Mathieu Kassovitz's first English language film as a director (the same director who brought us the excellent La Haine and The Crimson Rivers),my expectations were built even more.But I have to admit that I was sorely disappointed with the film, and this is why,Although Kassovitz's direction was not bad , the main problem I believe, lies firmly at the hands of  screenwriter Sebastian Gutierrez (who has directed Judas Kiss and is now writing the remake of the masterpiece The Eye). He managed to write a script that is totally predictable,lacking any originality or a fresh treatement of old plotlines.In any horror film, there is a moment early on,when the tension starts to build up, gripping the viewer increasingly  until the end. I kept looking for that moment in Gothika to start, where I would be totally immersed and involved in the story, but it never came.Moreover, I am surprised how bland the whole film is..The evil girl/ghost who has comeback to seek revenge on her killer through someone else is a concept that is still  very fresh in viewer's mind from quite recent films, (The Ring, What Lies Beneath, The Eye!!), while the girl looks exactly like the ghost in The Ring but with blond hair..She even has the same expressionsand look!!!The script also has unforgivable flaws..For instance the ambiguous relationship between Berry and Downey Jr was badly treated, and at the end he just disappears when I expected a proper conclusion that will clear it.The ending was quite silly!! (and I thought De Niro's tattoos in Cape Fear were over the top!!!)...the Scream reference was quite obvious but very weakly done.There was also a reference to Sixth Sense right at the very last scene, but it was too predictable and also very silly..So was the supernatural writing on the arm (Not Alone) straight from the 'Help Me' in Exorcist..Halle Berry 's acting was good as you expect from this wonderful actress, and it is always good to see such a fine actor and actress like Bernard Hill and Penelope Cruz who is gorgeous and sweet in whatever role she is in, but all these talents were sadly wasted.I know Mathieu Kassovitz can deliver a much better film than this with a good solid script, which unfortunately he did not have.If you love ghost stories as much as I do, then by all means stick to the classics of the genre like The Innocents, The Others, The Eye or even BWP and forget about this one because the only tension and anxiety you will feel is through constantly looking at your watch, hoping time might pass just quicker.",1,A Very Disappointing Film!!,1086825600,"06 10, 2004",2004,2727,"['was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'liking', 'Gothika', 'enjoy', 'good', 'ghost', 'stories', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'French', 'directors', 'general', 'other', 'being', 'Mathieu', 'Kassovitz', 'first', 'English', 'language', 'film', 'director', 'same', 'director', 'who', 'brought', 'excellent', 'La', 'Haine', 'Crimson', 'Rivers', 'expectations', 'were', 'built', 'even', 'more.But', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'film', 'why', 'Kassovitz', 'direction', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'main', 'problem', 'believe', 'firmly', 'hands', 'screenwriter', 'Sebastian', 'Gutierrez', 'who', 'directed', 'Judas', 'Kiss', 'now', 'writing', 'remake', 'masterpiece', 'Eye', 'managed', 'write', 'script', 'totally', 'predictable', 'lacking', 'originality', 'fresh', 'treatement', 'old', 'plotlines.In', 'horror', 'film', 'moment', 'early', 'when', 'tension', 'build', 'up', 'gripping', 'viewer', 'increasingly', 'end', 'kept', 'looking', 'moment', 'Gothika', 'start', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'totally', 'immersed', 'involved', 'story', 'never', 'came.Moreover', 'am', 'surprised', 'how', 'bland', 'whole', 'film', 'is..The', 'evil', 'girl/ghost', 'who', 'comeback', 'seek', 'revenge', 'killer', 'someone', 'else', 'concept', 'still', 'very', 'fresh', 'viewer', 'mind', 'quite', 'recent', 'films', 'Ring', 'What', 'Beneath', 'Eye', 'girl', 'exactly', 'ghost', 'Ring', 'blond', 'hair..She', 'even', 'same', 'expressionsand', 'look', 'script', 'also', 'unforgivable', 'flaws..For', 'instance', 'ambiguous', 'relationship', 'Berry', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'was', 'badly', 'treated', 'end', 'just', 'when', 'expected', 'proper', 'conclusion', 'will', 'clear', 'it.The', 'ending', 'was', 'quite', 'silly', 'thought', 'De', 'Niro', 'tattoos', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'were', 'top', 'Scream', 'reference', 'was', 'quite', 'obvious', 'very', 'weakly', 'done.There', 'was', 'also', 'reference', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'right', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'was', 'too', 'predictable', 'also', 'very', 'silly..So', 'was', 'supernatural', 'writing', 'arm', 'Not', 'Alone', 'straight', ""'Help"", 'Me', 'Exorcist..Halle', 'Berry', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'expect', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'always', 'good', 'see', 'such', 'fine', 'actor', 'actress', 'Bernard', 'Hill', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'who', 'gorgeous', 'sweet', 'role', 'talents', 'were', 'sadly', 'wasted.I', 'know', 'Mathieu', 'Kassovitz', 'can', 'deliver', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'good', 'solid', 'script', 'unfortunately', 'did', 'not', 'have.If', 'love', 'ghost', 'stories', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'then', 'means', 'stick', 'classics', 'genre', 'Innocents', 'Others', 'Eye', 'even', 'BWP', 'forget', 'one', 'only', 'tension', 'anxiety', 'will', 'feel', 'constantly', 'looking', 'watch', 'hoping', 'time', 'might', 'pass', 'just', 'quicker']",N/A

803330,A228JH8V9Y700G,B0001FR3IG,MortensOrchid,"[0, 0]","This was a rather odd movie in many ways.  It stars Halle Berry in a horror / suspense movie where she does not really fit into, but maybe that was the point.  This is a movie about mental illness, about dirty little secrets, and what happens when your paranoia comes true.  Supernatural goings on, settling vendettas, etc. are such hackneyed topics.Halle Berry plays a psychiatrist who is living a rather ordinary life.  Then, one day, she wakes up as a patient in the very psychiatric hospital that she was working in.  What happened?  One night she drove home and murdered her husband, but not after seeing a ghost of a teenager exploding into flames.  From there, this goes into a rather predictable murder mystery complete with enough secondary characters, photographs and newspaper articles to fill in the gaps of the story that we were blissfully unaware of.  Robert Downey Jr, however, does add a little sass into his secondary role which is somewhat a breath of fresh air.  An astute movie watcher and lover of mysteries will figure out exactly who done it (but I won't say here of course).Maybe what the biggest message in this movie is is when she is in the rec room with the other patients as a patient.  Her former patient (now peer) Penelope Cruz, sits down and tells her ""People think you are crazy, don't they?""  ""Are you scared?""  When Halle says yes, she says ""You should be"".  What happens when you are suddenly thrown into that circle?  People who once trusted you no longer do and put you away with ""those people"" because you are a danger to yourself and others?  Has it ever happened when no one believes you or they don't want to believe you?  And there's nothing you can do to stop it, they will just ignore or dismiss you because you're crazy.  You are wrong and they are right, no matter how much you cry or beg or demand that your voice be heard, the answer is always no and you are helpless.  In that case, we should be scared.

One day she is treating patients, the next, she is one of them.  I'd tell you more but it's really not worth the time it would take to write it out.

It's nice to see the heroine who actually did commit the crime, even if she was possessed at the time.Really, this film has everything a good thriller needs - a good mystery, twists and turns, and a character we really feel for. At times we begin to question Berry's sanity, which makes the ending even more exciting. The haunting / possession (whichever you want to call it) is not the scary thing about this movie. The scary thing is the psycho's that live next door, and the ones we are married to! It makes the audience quiver at the thought that anybody could be a sadistic killer, which is one of the main things I enjoyed about this film.Basically, it is a great film that traces the descent into near madness of both the protagonist and the viewer.

Gothika, with its creepy cover seemed to fit the bill.Miranda Grey is a psychologist.  She works at a Penitentiary in the psych ward.  After driving home and having an odd occurrence though, she wakes up only to find herself a patient in the same Penitentiary.  Worst thing is, everyone seems to believe she has committed murder, and something unnatural is stalking her.  But since she is now ""crazy"" she has no one to turn to for help.CharactersHalle Berry: Miranda DreyRobert Downey Jr: Pete GrahamCharles Dutton: Douglas GreyJohn Carroll Lynch: Sheriff RyanPenelope Cruz: Chloe SavaBernard Hill: Phil ParsonsFor as many famous actors that are in this movie, they are definitely under-utilized.  Berry gets the most screen time, and given that's she's supposed to be crazy for the larger part of the movie, that's definitely interesting.  But I think she does more screaming than talking.  Cruz probably has the next biggest role, and since she's an inmate too, again, there's not much meaningful dialogue going on.  Although she plays a convincing patient.  Downey Jr. barely has any time at all and I honestly didn't see the point in his part.  He doesn't add much to the movie at all or really develop any breakthroughs.  The Sheriff plays a more important role than him.  It's just weird that more time wasn't spent developing all these characters if they were going to have big names play them.And the plot.  Well, let's just say you have to suspend disbelief for a lot of it.  And I'm not talking about the paranormal aspect of it.  To believe that Grey can go from being a doctor to a patient in the same place, within three days, just doesn't make sense.  It seems more logical that she would be in a hospital or other short-term facility rather than the penitentiary.  I liked the overall theme of being part crazy and part truthful and having noone believe you because you're in a psych ward though.  To me, that's more terrifying than the ghosts.  So much could happen to you and noone would believe you because you're in the facility.  You just have to hope the wardens aren't corrupt or sadistic.The overall scene was dark and shadowy.  It made me wonder why the facility didn't do something about their electric.  Especially when dealing with people with fragile psyches.  I know it was just the movie trying to be scary, but it was another unbelievable thing.  But it did set the tone for this being a horror film.  As did the special effects.  They were pretty well done and realistic and it seemed as if Grey was not in control of her own body when the paranormal was attacking her.  To cap it all off, we have ""Behind Blue Eyes"" as the song that plays at the end of the film (not much music otherwise) and to me that's always been a depressing song so it fits.Not a great film but it's somewhat spooky.  If you like big name actors and decent special effects you'll tolerate it.  But if you're expecting spectacular writing and dialogue, this just isn't the movie for it.Review by M.

The casting is done well. The first 30 minutes of this film will have you amused, maybe even scared at times as a psychiatrist (Berry) finds herself on the other side of the bars in an institution for the criminally insane with a somewhat overfriendly psychiatrist (Downey) probing her mind for reasons why she murdered her psychiatrist husband with an axe. Then the plot takes a turn and Berry starts to remember seeing ghosts before the murder and then the ghost appears for real and tries to help her escape and then the story just totally goes off the rails and becomes some sort of a twisted snuff film production murder mystery with missing women. Then the movie turns to total farce for a special effects grand finale as the murderer is unmasked in Scooby style and whatever may have been plausible is now well and truly just another direct-to-video story with some good acting and higher production values than what it really deserves.Does this mean you should not watch it? To be honest you have seen a lot worse than Gothika and maybe it is worth a look for Berry alone but when all is said and done this is still a poor movie with MTV production values. The bottom line is that Gothika is all special effects driven with a terrible third rate story that is more apt for television and not a movie.

The thrilling ghostly moments and special effects will hold your attention as you try to figure out why Dr. Grey ended up here.

I was cringing through this, and for all the wrong reasons, LOL.

Wow, what a waste of film, and a waste of my time!Director Mathieu Kassovitz does an amiable job of creating atmosphere early on, but it is quickly all wasted by an atrocious screenplay by Sebastian Gutierrez. Plus, I wasn't that impressed with Halle Berry's ""generic"" acting either. Yes, she's good, but not as great as a lot of people want to let on. On the other hand, poor Penelope Cruz, who is a great actress, is completely wasted here! I kept saying to myself that it would be a better film if it were more about her, but to my heavy disappointment, she is only in a few little scenes; matter of fact, you can count them on one hand. What a shame! And while I've never been a huge fan of Robert Downey Jr., he does some good acting in some things, and even does a good job here, but it is all in vain, for his talents are also wasted here as well; as are the talents of John Carroll Lynch, and practically everybody else that is in this.You know a movie is bad when at the one hour mark, the lead character screams out at the ghost, ""What do you want from me?!"", and you start laughing and thinking ""I just want this movie to END!"" The word ""convoluted"" doesn't even begin to describe this film! It might have been better if they had stuck to either making a straight-forward ghost story, or a straight-forward psychological mystery thriller, but this film tries (too hard) to make all of the above, and fails miserably.

803350,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B0001FR3IG,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[4, 5]","Promising!With a cast like the (normally) excellent Halle Berry, the solid Penelope Cruz, hugely-underrated Robert Downey Jr., and the magnetic and enthralling Charles Dutton (in Cameo), and a solid, original-esque premise unlike much of the bland horror-drivel being released these days, ""Gothika"" promised to be a once-off treat for fans of psychological horror and another galvanisation of Ms. Berry's career.However, thanks to a really uninventive script and some blatant (and highly disjointed) plaigirism, ""Gothika"" instead descends to the shameful level of ""The (new) Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""13 Ghosts"" in terms of unoriginality and flashy effects masking a very definite potential for excellence.""Gothika"" deals with Ms. Berry as Dr. Miranda Grey, a clinical psychologist who, after a particularly hard days' work, is the victim of a supernatural encounter on a deserted road. Waking up in her own hospital's care three days later, she is informed that she has murdered her husband (Dutton) and must stand trial for it.Believing in her own innocence, she is aided in her quest for the truth by Cruz and Downey-Jr., and the movie rolls and trundles along from there.Performance-wise there's nothing to either praise or disparage. All the cast members, be they famous or no, give a humdrum sort of turn - there's an almost-palpable veil of ""couldn't-give-a-damn"" about the whole thing - Cruz doesn't seem very crazy, Downey-Jr. doesn't seem in love, Berry doesn't seem too scared - but this is the fault of a maudlin, lifeless script. The dialog, it seems, is merely there to provide a poor grist for the mill of a myriad of special effects, and this tone unfortunately colours the whole movie.It is those special effects that have the greates claim to competency here - some lovely camerawork and truly innovative techniques (panning the nape of Berry's neck, watery shower-faces, strobe-lit solitary confinement) abound, but unfortuantely these take over from the proposed tension and atmosphere that the storyline hints at, and we're left to sit through some big bright bangs and colourful explosions that negate all sense of horror and drama. A bit like ""13 Ghosts"" but without the sense of tongue-in-cheek.Direction follows a similar pattern - everything is overstated, everything is BIG and HOLLYWOOD - but in a movie about Ghosts, where movies like ""Ringu"" and ""The Others"" have already shown us that a ghost story is best portrayed with a sense of the Invisible, relying on the audience's imagination to fill in the gaps, this directorial strategem fails miserably, and furthers the sense of Overstatement and Predictability provided by the flashy effects.On the plus side there are three or four very effective ""cheap shock"" moments here, but the ending is so hackneyed (it's a direct lift from ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""The Cell""), that very soon we'll all have forgotten about ""Gothika"".I really do hope that Ms. Berry's career can forget about it, too.

Matthieu Kassovitz, director of the stunningly silly The Crimson Rivers, gets behind the camera for his first English-language feature, a supposedly spooky tale about Miranda Grey (Halle Berry), a psychiatrist who wakes up one morning and finds herself imprisoned in the very facility where she works, accused of murdering her husband (Charles S. Dutton, late of Alien 3 and Roc). Her friend and co-worker Pete (Robert Downey Jr.) is trying to help her remember the murder, about which she knows nothing, but Grey finds many of her own platitudes forced back down her throat, coming to understand that sometimes the saner you are, the more crazy you look to the outside world.It's all quite a nice little cautionary tale, and there are a couple of jumpworthy moments, but what really remains after watching this is the profoundly leaden moralizing throughout. Even the usually wonderful Dutton labors through the wooden script.All in all, though, it could have been worse. Robert Zemeckis (one of the film's producers) could have directed.

Gothika is one such movie.Oscar winner Halle Berry plays Miranda, a psychologist working in a mental institution. One night, after a rough session with Chloe (Cruz), a difficult patient, she goes home only to find the road blocked. After being forced to take a different route, she crashes into a ditch after swerving her car trying not to hit a girl standin in the road.When she wakes up, she's trapped in her own clinic as one of the patients, and being charged for the murder of her husband (Dutton).Is she going crazy? Has she already lost her mind? Did she or didn't she kill her husband and why can't she remember? What follows is a series of discoveries that lead Miranda in a direction she never expected and the answer to the mystery of her madness.However, the film does a poor job in creating true suspense. The whole movie is dimly lit and most of the scenes in the sanitarium have a blue tone, as if to reflect the depression and the fear, but because it is constantly that way, it ends up losing its effect.The acting is simply awful. Berry should return her Oscar after this, and Robert Downey jr., as the friendly (or is he?) doctor gives a stiff performance. The acting was so bad that Pen&eacute;lope Cruz ends up being the best actor in the film. Go figure.All in all, it's not a bad film, but it could have been so much better.Two last comments: the film is superbly produced, which makes sense when you learn that this is another Dark Castle production. Dark Castle, for those of you not in the know, is Robert Zemeckis's and Joel Silver's company for suspense/mystery films, such as Ghost ship and Thir13en ghosts.

In it, Halle Berry plays a psychologist who finds herself a patient at the very same Institution for the Criminally Insane where she works after she becomes the prime suspect in the grizzly murder of her husband, a director at the hospital.  The film has some fun with the idea of a doctor having to experience life from the other side of the psychiatric couch, trying to convince the very medical establishment she was once a part of that she is not a raving lunatic.  Indeed, the film is at its most intriguing when it is preoccupied with the irony of its setup, and at its least compelling when it is focused on the silliness of its supernatural elements (which I will not iterate here).  Where ""Gothika"" falls down is in its strained, convoluted plotting and its over-reliance on horror movie conventions and clich&eacute;s - i.e. cued-up thunderstorms, false scares, neck-snapping plot twists.  The whole avenging-spirit premise has been exploited to a fare-thee-well in movies of late, and ""Gothika"" brings nothing new to the theme.Berry delivers a one-note performance of sustained shrill hysteria throughout, while Robert Downey Jr. is largely wasted in the role of a fellow psychologist who may or may not have Berry's best interests at heart.The film is, I suppose, an acceptable Guilty Pleasure for those dark stormy nights when nothing but a cheesy, over-the-top thriller will do, but don't expect to remember it much past the scrawling closing credits.",2,reasonably well-tooled claptrap,1094342400,"09 5, 2004",2004,1573,"['**1/2', 'Gothika', 'pure', 'horror', 'movie', 'hokum', 'writer', 'Sebastian', 'Gutierrez', 'director', 'Mathieu', 'Kassovitz', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'psychologist', 'who', 'patient', 'very', 'same', 'Institution', 'Criminally', 'Insane', 'where', 'prime', 'suspect', 'grizzly', 'murder', 'husband', 'director', 'hospital', 'film', 'fun', 'idea', 'doctor', 'having', 'experience', 'life', 'other', 'side', 'psychiatric', 'couch', 'trying', 'convince', 'very', 'medical', 'establishment', 'was', 'once', 'part', 'not', 'raving', 'lunatic', 'Indeed', 'film', 'most', 'intriguing', 'when', 'preoccupied', 'irony', 'setup', 'least', 'compelling', 'when', 'focused', 'silliness', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'will', 'not', 'iterate', 'here', 'Where', 'Gothika', 'down', 'strained', 'convoluted', 'plotting', 'over-reliance', 'horror', 'movie', 'conventions', 'clich', 'eacute', 'i.e', 'cued-up', 'thunderstorms', 'false', 'scares', 'neck-snapping', 'plot', 'twists', 'whole', 'avenging-spirit', 'premise', 'been', 'exploited', 'fare-thee-well', 'movies', 'late', 'Gothika', 'nothing', 'new', 'theme.Berry', 'one-note', 'performance', 'sustained', 'shrill', 'hysteria', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'largely', 'wasted', 'role', 'fellow', 'psychologist', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'Berry', 'best', 'interests', 'heart.The', 'film', 'suppose', 'acceptable', 'Guilty', 'Pleasure', 'dark', 'stormy', 'nights', 'when', 'nothing', 'cheesy', 'over-the-top', 'thriller', 'will', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'remember', 'much', 'scrawling', 'closing', 'credits']",N/A

The American debut for French director Mathieu Kassovitz - he played the shy love interest in ""Amelie"" - ""Gothika"" is visually up-to-snuff (an intended pun that you'll understand if you see the movie) but loaded with the kind of boo material - ominous tattoos, torture, the stigmata - that lost its freshness the minute ""The Silence of the Lambs"" hit theaters. You would have figured Ralph Fiennes punctuated the body art motif with his turn in ""Red Dragon."" You figured wrong.Berry is Dr. Miranda Grey, a state hospital shrink attempting the break the wall of a patient - played by Penelope Cruz with something I'd like to call ""endearing menace""- while Miranda's administrator husband (Charles S. Dutton) administrates and a colleague (Robert Downey, Jr.) fawns after her in that creepy, insinuating way only Downey can. The quick, dirty setup leads to a dark stormy night where the main road is flooded over and Miranda is forced to traverse a bridge in middle of a forest. She encounters a young girl and wakes up the next morning, a patient in her very own hospital, accused of murdering her husband.Since ""Gothika"" never brings any other murder suspects into the picture, the movie explores not who killed the Dutton character, but why the girl ""influenced"" Miranda to do it. Let it be said that the filmmakers conjure up a thoroughly hateful, cruel explanation for the murder that argues not only that one bad deed deserves another, but that two bad deeds an entertaining movie makes. ""Gothika"" is no longer than 90 minutes, and yet it's too long by half; there is so little meat to Sebastian Guitierrez's screenplay that Downey's repeated interrogations, and Cruz's rueful whisperings, exist only to stretch the movie to official feature length.Berry, who can be very good (""Monster's Ball,"" ""Losing Isaiah"") or virtually transparent (the ""X-Men"" movies) plays Miranda as one long, freaked out, screaming mess - Berry's heart is in it, but her talent isn't. Cruz partakes in another bewildering, at-times-incomprehensible supporting role. Downey plays a good guy and makes him borderline insufferable.And then there's Kassovitz, for whom I see a future as a director, even if the material is thin. He has horror tendencies - the prison of ""Gothika"" is murky, and the movie's ""encounter"" scene is handled well - mixed some basic clue of pacing; the movie drags, but not for Kassovitz's lack of effort.",2,What the heck was thatika?

She crashes into a ditch when she thinks she has hit a girl standing in the rode. Miranda wakes up in the very institution she works at. She finds out that she is being charged with the murder of her husband (Dutton), but she can't remember what happens. Pete (Robert Downy Jr.) being Miranda's friend is trying to help her remember the nights events.So now the question to be asked is why did she kill her husband? did she really kill her husband? Why are all these strange things happening to her? This movie will take you through and twists and turns that were unexpected. The movie because of the darkness in the sanitarium had a gloom and doom kind of effect.I've read complaints about the blinking lights. The blinking lights did not bother me at all. I don't want to give anything away, but the lights had to do with a certain &quot;ghost spirit&quot; being in the area I wonder why other people did not catch that?

803370,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B0001FR3IG,S. Schell,"[6, 8]","I don't watch many horror movies but I do know which aspects make them palpably frightening.  A prime example is ""The Sixth Sense"", a film which focused upon the interest, fear and even skepticism that we the American populace generally have of the supernatural, particularly ghosts.  Enthralling throughout, ""The Sixth Sense"" didn't rely upon a violin-laden, fright-inducing score to make the audience's skin crawl; it was largely dependent upon and owes its ominous success to a credible story/screenplay, strategic lighting, make-up and most importantly, the performances of the actors.""Gothika"", through its many recent TV spots, purports itself to be a supernatural thriller in the league of ""The Sixth Sense"" but fails to make the cut, its efforts to induce terror painfully obvious and its plot eventually falling into a pattern of predictability (but two tweens who sat in my row at the theater would beg to differ, promptly SCREAMING at every cue of suspenseful music).The story carves its flimsy foundation with Dr. Miranda Grey (Berry) making her rounds at an asylum of which her husband Doug (Dutton) is the chief administrator.  Driving through a heavy downpour after a late night at the office, a giant sinkhole surrounded by a police barricade forces Miranda to take an alternate route home and she nearly mows down a young girl standing in the middle of the road.  When she leaps out of her SUV in a panic to check on the girl, the drenched and whimpering lass promptly bursts into flames with a heinous shriek and Miranda blacks out.When Miranda regains consciousness she finds herself back in the asylum, only this time she's a patient locked in a cell in the solitary ward.  Visited by fellow psychiatrist and former co-worker Pete Graham (Downey), she learns that Doug has been brutally murdered and that she is the culprit, having repressed the memory of the crime for three years.  On top of the shock of losing her husband, Miranda is haunted by the disgruntled spirit of Rachel Parsons (Mackey), the very specter who appeared on the road that fateful night.  Distraught over Pete no longer taking her seriously (""You can't trust somebody when they think you're crazy"") and Rachel's violent visitations, Miranda comes closer to discovering a horrible truth and even her expertise in neuropsychiatry won't prepare her for what she finds out.Berry, now an Oscar alum, disappoints not because of her performance but because of her invested time in a high-expectations/low-payoff film (the same can be said for Robert Downey Jr., now making a comeback after a long struggle with drug addiction).  A-list thespian Bernard Hill (Titanic, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers) wastes his time as well and Penelope Cruz is a bore as disheveled mental patient Chloe.Matthieu Kassovitz, having played the field as a screenwriter and an actor, has now done what most accomplished people in the entertainment industry (particularly actors) set their sights on - directing.  Although he has manned a few productions already (almost all of them in French), ""Gothika"" marks his place in America as a director and he brings with him a screenplay from Sebastian Gutierrez, a man who like himself has a couple of slashes in his job title (actor/director/screewriter).Bottom line, ""Gothika"" may scare a younger crowd that's not keen on horror movies but for more mature audiences, it will dash hopes on many levels.  If you haven't already, grab ""The Sixth Sense"" at your local video store or pick up ""The Exorcist"", ""Alien"" and/or Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" (all three titles are on imdb.com's ""Top 50 Horror Films"" list) and kill the lights - you're in for a frighteningly good time.",2,Thumbs-Down Thriller,1069977600,"11 28, 2003",2003,3687,"['do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'do', 'know', 'aspects', 'make', 'palpably', 'frightening', 'prime', 'example', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'film', 'focused', 'interest', 'fear', 'even', 'skepticism', 'American', 'populace', 'generally', 'have', 'supernatural', 'particularly', 'ghosts', 'Enthralling', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'did', ""n't"", 'rely', 'violin-laden', 'fright-inducing', 'score', 'make', 'audience', 'skin', 'crawl', 'was', 'largely', 'dependent', 'upon', 'ominous', 'success', 'credible', 'story/screenplay', 'strategic', 'lighting', 'make-up', 'most', 'importantly', 'performances', 'actors', 'Gothika', 'many', 'recent', 'TV', 'spots', 'be', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'league', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'make', 'cut', 'efforts', 'induce', 'terror', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'plot', 'eventually', 'falling', 'pattern', 'predictability', 'two', 'tweens', 'who', 'sat', 'row', 'theater', 'would', 'beg', 'differ', 'promptly', 'SCREAMING', 'cue', 'suspenseful', 'music', 'story', 'flimsy', 'foundation', 'Dr.', 'Miranda', 'Grey', 'Berry', 'making', 'rounds', 'asylum', 'husband', 'Doug', 'Dutton', 'chief', 'administrator', 'Driving', 'heavy', 'downpour', 'late', 'night', 'office', 'giant', 'sinkhole', 'surrounded', 'police', 'barricade', 'forces', 'Miranda', 'take', 'alternate', 'route', 'home', 'nearly', 'down', 'young', 'girl', 'standing', 'middle', 'road', 'When', 'SUV', 'panic', 'check', 'girl', 'drenched', 'whimpering', 'lass', 'promptly', 'flames', 'heinous', 'shriek', 'Miranda', 'blacks', 'out.When', 'Miranda', 'consciousness', 'back', 'asylum', 'only', 'time', 'patient', 'locked', 'cell', 'solitary', 'ward', 'Visited', 'fellow', 'psychiatrist', 'former', 'co-worker', 'Pete', 'Graham', 'Downey', 'Doug', 'been', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'culprit', 'having', 'repressed', 'memory', 'crime', 'three', 'years', 'top', 'shock', 'losing', 'husband', 'Miranda', 'haunted', 'disgruntled', 'spirit', 'Rachel', 'Parsons', 'Mackey', 'very', 'specter', 'who', 'appeared', 'road', 'fateful', 'night', 'Distraught', 'Pete', 'no', 'longer', 'taking', 'seriously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'trust', 'somebody', 'when', 'think', ""'re"", 'crazy', 'Rachel', 'violent', 'visitations', 'Miranda', 'closer', 'discovering', 'horrible', 'truth', 'even', 'expertise', 'neuropsychiatry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'prepare', 'what', 'out.Berry', 'now', 'Oscar', 'alum', 'disappoints', 'not', 'performance', 'invested', 'time', 'high-expectations/low-payoff', 'film', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'now', 'making', 'comeback', 'long', 'struggle', 'drug', 'addiction', 'A-list', 'thespian', 'Bernard', 'Hill', 'Titanic', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Two', 'Towers', 'time', 'well', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'bore', 'disheveled', 'mental', 'patient', 'Chloe.Matthieu', 'Kassovitz', 'having', 'played', 'field', 'screenwriter', 'actor', 'now', 'done', 'what', 'most', 'accomplished', 'people', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'particularly', 'actors', 'set', 'sights', 'directing', 'manned', 'few', 'productions', 'already', 'almost', 'French', 'Gothika', 'place', 'America', 'director', 'screenplay', 'Sebastian', 'Gutierrez', 'man', 'who', 'couple', 'slashes', 'job', 'title', 'actor/director/screewriter', '.Bottom', 'line', 'Gothika', 'may', 'scare', 'younger', 'crowd', 'not', 'keen', 'horror', 'movies', 'more', 'mature', 'audiences', 'will', 'dash', 'hopes', 'many', 'levels', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'grab', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'pick', 'up', 'Exorcist', 'Alien', 'and/or', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Psycho', 'three', 'titles', 'are', 'imdb.com', 'Top', '50', 'Horror', 'Films', 'list', 'kill', 'lights', ""'re"", 'frighteningly', 'good', 'time']",N/A

The last third of the film relies, not on actual scares, but on those little Jump-out-of-your-pants type bursts of loud sound and action.  These consist of quick little flashes of the dead girl appearing at any given moment.  To me, this was kind of a cheap one trick pony way of doing things, but observing the audience's reaction(they jumped EVERY TIME regardless of the fact that you could see it coming a mile away!), I guess the film makers got what they set out to achieve.  Personally, I don't know how people could fall for this gag over and over again. My own girlfriend kept jumping into me, smashing my pack of Basic full flavors in the process.  This ended up being a cruddy movie.  Not Texas Chainsaw Remake cruddy, but the second half just takes the plot into territories the movie shouldn't have gone.  It becomes too derivative and outrageous to take seriously or be scared of.  For instance, this spooky ghost child wants Halle Berry to help her out in avenging her murder, but usually beats the snot out of Halle for no apparent reason when she appears to her.  What's that all about?  Plus, the villians and motivations are too stupid to buy.  If I were you, I'd stick with Stir Of Echoes, a movie that managed to conjure up some real creepiness instead of relying on startle tactics.",2,Stunkika,1070150400,"11 30, 2003",2003,1703,"['Here', 'yet', 'spooky', 'ghost', 'child', 'avenge', 'murder', 'flicks', 'seem', 'fashionable', 'right', 'now', 'Frankly', 'not', 'original', 'plot', 'device', 'grown', 'little', 'long', 'tooooooth', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'movie', 'actually', 'well', 'quickly', 'clicheland', 'scare', 'film', 'been', 'done', 'greater', 'effect', 'earlier', 'better', 'horror', 'film', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'relies', 'not', 'actual', 'scares', 'little', 'Jump-out-of-your-pants', 'type', 'bursts', 'loud', 'sound', 'action', 'consist', 'quick', 'little', 'flashes', 'dead', 'girl', 'appearing', 'given', 'moment', 'was', 'kind', 'cheap', 'one', 'trick', 'pony', 'way', 'doing', 'things', 'observing', 'audience', 'reaction', 'jumped', 'EVERY', 'TIME', 'regardless', 'fact', 'could', 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'guess', 'film', 'makers', 'got', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'achieve', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'people', 'could', 'fall', 'gag', 'over', 'again', 'own', 'girlfriend', 'kept', 'jumping', 'smashing', 'pack', 'Basic', 'full', 'flavors', 'process', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'cruddy', 'movie', 'Not', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Remake', 'cruddy', 'second', 'half', 'just', 'plot', 'territories', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'gone', 'too', 'derivative', 'outrageous', 'take', 'seriously', 'be', 'scared', 'instance', 'spooky', 'ghost', 'child', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'help', 'out', 'avenging', 'murder', 'usually', 'snot', 'Halle', 'apparent', 'reason', 'when', 'What', 'villians', 'motivations', 'are', 'too', 'stupid', 'buy', 'were', ""'d"", 'stick', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'movie', 'managed', 'conjure', 'up', 'real', 'creepiness', 'instead', 'relying', 'startle', 'tactics']",N/A

O'Blenis,"[2, 4]","For some reason, I didn't expect great things from this movie, but ""Gothika"" was far, far better than I would have imagined and bodes extremely well for the future of Dark Castle.  Their remake of ""The House On Haunted Hill"" was okay, watchable certainly; ""Thirteen Ghosts"" was a slight step up but didn't quite fulfill its potential; then ""Ghost Ship"" went way up and was a really good movie, their first worth owning in my opinion.  ""Gothika"" is even better and I feel is the first Dark Castle production to attain true Greatness.Described as a movie about a doctor who suddenly finds herself instituionalized with a case of recent amnesia that's actually only the beginning of this unpredictable, imaginative spooker that's both truly disturbing and thrilling.  The performances are as impeccable as you'd expect from its accomplished cast, and every aspect of the production - the lighting, the special effects, the photography, everything - are first rate.  In my interpretation, there's alot under the surface that's never fully spelled out even in the end, and the potential for a sequel to reach even more diabolically horrifying heights.  Someone in a review or a message board or something somewhere opined that this movie and ""Fear Dot Com"" felt like they had an Asian influence to them, and I can't disagree.  If you're into ""Gothika"", you might want to consider giving some Asian horror greats like ""The Eye"" or ""4 Inyong Shiktak"" a try.

Every gesture, every moment, in the opening fifteen minutes of ""Gothika"" is emphasized by a thunderclap, a 10,000-watt burst of lightning, and a surging snatch of melodrama from John Ottman's first truly forgettable score. Right from the start, this film is so self-consciously and distractingly ""atmospheric"" that it never gets close to the kind of creepiness it's aiming for - we're never allowed to lower our defences for long enough to be shocked. Sadly, it's a case of style over substance, as Mathieu Kassovitz seems more intent on proving his visual literacy on a Hollywood budget, and stretching Halle Berry's no-nudity clause to the limits of plausibility with a litany of redundant swimming, showering and disrobing scenes. A better screenplay might not have been hampered by this kind of handling, but this one is unnecessarily average. The premise is great, and the pace escalates nicely towards the end, but Sebastian Gutierrez resists a wonderful opportunity to trump the ""ghost story"" conceit and make this about the very issue he sets up in the opening scenes: repression as a mechanism for survival. How much more interesting would this have been if, rather than being literally possessed by the ghost of a dead girl, Dr Grey had actually witnessed the girl's murder and repressed all knowledge of her husband's crime as a way of protecting herself, until it irrupted uncontrollably? It's essentially the same story - just make a few simple tweaks and lop off that appalling epilogue which makes it clear Dr Grey REALLY IS seeing ghosts. This could so easily have been turned from a supernatural bore into a genuine psychological thriller.  Dark Castle Entertainment can either continue to deliver B-grade horror films on A-grade budgets (with deservedly C-grade boxoffice results), or catch up with the contemporary cinema audience which is just too sophisticated to accept '50s schlock in shiny new packages.

803383,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0001FR3IG,Tim Janson,"[5, 5]","In this horror/thriller, Halle Berry stars as Dr. Miranda Grey, a Psycologist at a women's prison.  Charles S. Dutton is the Prisons Administrator.  Or at least I THINK it is a prison as opposed to a mental hospital...it's never really explained and is one of the very mind numbing problems you encounter while watching this movie.Anyway, on her way home from work on a &quot;dark and stormy night&quot; Gray swerves her car to miss a girl standing in the middle of the road.  When she approaces the girl to see if she is OK, the girl bursts into flames and Gray wakes up three days later, locked in the very prison she worked at.  What's more, she is accused of murdering her husband.OK...now I finad it hard to believe that she would be remanded to a prison IMMEDIATELY...would she not be held in jail to await trial?  Would it not take more than a few days for her to be examined by psychiatrists to determine her mental well-being?And even if she was locked up, does anyone think that she would be locked up and put in with the very inmates who she used to work with?  Gothika pushes logic to the limits.Well, while locked up she begins getting ghostly visions of this girl.  Of course her former co-worker Dr. Graham played by Robert Downey jr., believes these are just delusions.The ghost is more than helpful, twice freeing Gray from her cell so she can pursue clues about the spirit.  This leads to the revelation that a man with a tatoo of a woman on fire, is somehow raping women inside the prison and Gray is next on his list.In yet another incredible stretch of logic, while gray escapes from her cell pursued by dozens of guards, she finally makes it to the guard at the front desk who she is friendly with.  Rather than turn her in the guard not only keeps quiet, but actually gives her the keys to her car!!!  Evidently he seems to have no problem throwing away his car and aiding an escaped inmate.Well the clues all come together and reveal some shocking revelations about her husband and the identity of the rapist.  But how can this rapist just come and go into high security areas of the hospital/prison?  Don't ask...it's another one of brain dead plot threads.Finally we see that Gray never does go to jail for her husbands murder.  Evidently possession by a vengeful ghost is a viable murder defense these days.  Incredible.The ghostly images provide a few chills but you've seen the plot before about the dead wanting the living to solve the mystery of their deaths and bring the guilty to justice.  Stir of Echoes did it much more skillfully.Berry made a poor choice of scripts to follow up on an Oscar win.  There is little suspense and it's very easy to early on to figure out who is rapist.

803387,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0001FR3IG,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 3]","Joel Silver/Robert Zemeckis company ""Dark Castle Entertainment"" gives us the fourth picture that is probably inspired by Joan Crawford's cult horror ""Strait-Jacket, directed by, yes, William Castle, the king of the gimmicks.  As you see, instead of powerhouse performance of Crawford, ""Gothika"" features another Oscar winner Halle Berry as the tormented heroine of the film, who must uncover what ever really happened to herself.I warn you.  The story is impossible though intriguing.  Halle Berry's psychiatrist Dr. Miranda Grey encounters a strange little girl on the way home in the hard rain.  Then, she finds herself in the mental institute, where she is told that her husband is brutally killed at her house, and she is arrested for the murder about which she remembers nothing.  Then, during the time waiting for the trail, Miranda experiences weird things -- writings on the wall, for starters -- and she begins to believe somebody is trying to contact her from another world.  But who is that, and why?The story so far is not particularly original, but thanks to the great photography of Matthew Libatique (""Pai"") and production designs (by Graham 'grace' Walker, ""Ghost Ship""), the first half of ""Gothika"" goes fairly well, with occasional chills and scares.The spooky atomosphere, however, begins to disperse in the second half, in which the director seems to have decided to do something different than the Gothic thriller.  Some scenes looks as if coming from the outtakes of action films (bringing back the memory of Ms. Berry as a Bond Girl), and the final chapter is simply a letdown, too predictable and familiar.The director is Mathieu Kassovitz. of ""Crimson Rivers"" fame (but best known as an actor, the love interest in ""Amelie""), and like ""Crimson"" he puts style over substance.  This is an  atmospheric film, in which the logics mean nothing but the excuse for the film to hold on more than 90 minutes.Actors are not bad, not great, just good.  Robert Downey Jr. is, as he always is, a reliable support who could be either comic or suspicious, and Penelope Cruz is cast against the type as one of the inmates of the institute.""Gothika"" is beautiful, I mean ""beautiful"" in terms of Gothic fashion.
