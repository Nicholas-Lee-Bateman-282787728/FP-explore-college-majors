Yes, this movie belongs on DVD in Dolby 5.1.The story is so good, you'll swear it is fiction.  But it isn't.  A country girl from the Australian outback who becomes a world-famous opera singer?  Come on!  But it's all true.The first half of the movie is her struggle and rise.  From sneaking off the ranch to an audition (of which her father vehemently disapproves) to her scholarship to study singing in Paris--except that the person she's supposed to study with knows nothing about this and refuses to take her.  How she gets this woman's attention is priceless.The meeting with the young doctor after her debut at the Monte Carlo opera.  Her big night and no one to share it with!  The doctor agrees to celebrate with her, and the two fall in love.  But she has her life and he has his.  They part.  A few years later, she makes her debut at the Met and everyone is fawning over her.  The doctor comes backstage and congratulates her; but there are so many, she doesn't recognize/remember him until he has walked off, hurt and disappointed.  And...well, you can see, this is quite a story.The polio occupies the first part of the second half, then there is the story of her struggle to make a comeback.  The movie is not a downer at all, in spite of the polio.  It's triumphant, moving, touching, and sweet.

358353,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6303120504,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","Eleanor Parker's Oscar-nominated performance is the main reason to witness INTERRUPTED MELODY, the true story of Australian opera singer Marjorie Lawrence, who was felled by polio at the height of her international career. Parker gives one of her stellar turns as Lawrence (helped by the accomplished dubbing of opera singer Eileen Farrell); and her chemistry with leading man Glenn Ford is palpable.We follow Marjorie Lawrence (Parker) from the outback Queensland farm where she was raised, to the glitter of the Paris opera stages; and finally into the arms of Dr. Thomas King (Ford), for whom she sacrifices the momentum of her career. But a necessary South American tour comes to a crashing, premature end when Lawrence collapses during a rehearsal, and is diagnosed with severe polio.INTERRUPTED MELODY is a testmament to the artistry and bravery of Marjorie Lawrence, who in real life went on to continue her remarkable career despite the odds. Eleanor Parker's performance is outstanding. To her credit she does take on an (albeit slight) Australian accent, and her dedication to the opera scenes really shows on screen (according to reports, Parker sang along to Eileen Farrell's musical tracks so that her throat would visibly flex and operate just as a regular singer's would). INTERRUPTED MELODY features beautifully-staged excerpts from many operas, including ""Il Trovatore"", ""Madama Butterfly"", ""La Boheme"", and ""Carmen"".The print on this DVD-R from the Warner Archive is probably the best we'll get. The overall quality of the print is fine and watchable but clearly hasn't undergone any specific restoration; I'd say it's on a par with the print normally seen on TCM. There are some compression and strobing issues, but nothing serious.

Her performance in ""Interrupted Melody"" is probably the crowning jewel of her career.  As Marjorie Lawrence, a world renowned opera singer who is subsequently stricken with polio, Parker has to assay both a stage performer and a woman struggling with an illness that cripples both her body and soul.  In the earlier scenes Parker is mesmerizingly coquettish in the opera scenes despite the fact that she is lip synching to the voice of Eileen Farrell.  When illness strikes the film could have veered into mawkishness but Parker keeps the film grounded by avoiding overplaying the scenes.  My favorite scene in the film is when Lawrence is contemplating a comeback by performing at a V.A. hospital.  Her choice of ""Over the Rainbow"" is both inspiring and touching.  Not to be overlooked is Glenn Ford as her supportive husband who sacrifices his medical practice to care for his wife.

Ziinojr,"[3, 3]","This was the last of MGM's three powerful and popular 1955 musical biopics about famous female singers,the other two being Susan Hayward's harrowing ""I'll Cry Tomorrow"" and Doris Day's brilliant ""Love Me Or Leave Me"".Like those,it's one of Hollywood's best biopics.It stars Eleanor Parker and Glenn Ford in the true storyof Austrailian opera star Marjorie Lawrence,who overcame a dirt-poor childhood andmade a memorable comeback after being stricken with polio in the prime of her career.The movie has MGM's usual gorgeous Technicolor production and a great soundtrack featuring favorite arias and popular songs,all splendidly performed by Eileen Farrell,who dubbed Parker's vocals(her ""Over The Rainbow"" is marvelous!)The musical numbers are beautifully staged.The movie also benefits from strong Curtis Bernhart direction and a solid,well-written William Ludwig-Sonya Levien script.But the movie's best feature is its cast.Glenn Ford is excellent as Lawrence's devoted doctor husband,and Eleanor Parker gives the performance of her life as Marjorie.They are well-backed by a brilliant supporting cast,including Cecil Kellaway and a very young Roger Moore.This is still one the best and most truthful biographies ever made!I'll Cry TomorrowLove Me or Leave Me",5,A great musical biopic,1308873600,"06 24, 2011",2011,1260,"['was', 'last', 'MGM', 'three', 'powerful', 'popular', '1955', 'musical', 'biopics', 'famous', 'female', 'singers', 'other', 'two', 'being', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'harrowing', ""'ll"", 'Cry', 'Tomorrow', 'Doris', 'Day', 'brilliant', 'Love', 'Me', 'Or', 'Leave', 'Me', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'best', 'biopics.It', 'stars', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'true', 'storyof', 'Austrailian', 'opera', 'star', 'Marjorie', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'overcame', 'dirt-poor', 'childhood', 'andmade', 'memorable', 'comeback', 'being', 'stricken', 'polio', 'prime', 'career.The', 'movie', 'MGM', 'usual', 'gorgeous', 'Technicolor', 'production', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'featuring', 'favorite', 'arias', 'popular', 'songs', 'splendidly', 'performed', 'Eileen', 'Farrell', 'who', 'dubbed', 'Parker', 'vocals', 'Rainbow', 'marvelous', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'beautifully', 'staged.The', 'movie', 'also', 'benefits', 'strong', 'Curtis', 'Bernhart', 'direction', 'solid', 'well-written', 'William', 'Ludwig-Sonya', 'Levien', 'script.But', 'movie', 'best', 'feature', 'cast.Glenn', 'Ford', 'excellent', 'Lawrence', 'devoted', 'doctor', 'husband', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'performance', 'life', 'Marjorie.They', 'are', 'well-backed', 'brilliant', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Cecil', 'Kellaway', 'very', 'young', 'Roger', 'Moore.This', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'truthful', 'biographies', 'ever', 'made', ""'ll"", 'Cry', 'TomorrowLove', 'Me', 'Leave', 'Me']",Interrupted Melody VHS
