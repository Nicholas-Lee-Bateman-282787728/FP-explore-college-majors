962505,A30CZB6BX494JG,B000CSTKIS,"blackturtle ""blackturtle.us""","[1, 5]","This was obviously a low-budget movie and it seemed almost as if the story was written with budgetary limitations in mind. That is, it's almost as if the director and writers worked hard to come up with a plot and set of circumstances that would allow the filming of the movie to be convenient and inexpensive. If this was the case, then they did a reasonably good job of working within their budgetary constraints because the movie is somewhat entertaining and reasonably well produced. However, a major flaw of the movie is that the fathers become unrealistically involved in a Pinewood Derby competition and pretty much squeeze their kids out of the contest and out of the movie. This plot twist was probably included mostly as a way to expedite the filming of the movie. That is, it is quicker and easier to film scenes with adults than with children and so it seems that the director took a bit of a short cut here. In many ways this movie is similar to ""Kicking and Screaming"" in this way. The key difference is that while the adult actors in ""Kicking and Screaming"" were able to compensate for this deficiency, the actors in ""Down and Derby"" would have been better suited to the role of supporting a plot that emphasized the kids a bit more! That's not to say that the adults lacked talent, but their performances (and the script they were supplied with) weren't enough to make up for the awkward nature of the story. All that being said, I still rate this movie at three stars!",3,Low Budget Movie,1228780800,"12 9, 2008",2008,1485,"['was', 'obviously', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'seemed', 'almost', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'budgetary', 'limitations', 'mind', 'almost', 'director', 'writers', 'worked', 'hard', 'come', 'up', 'plot', 'set', 'circumstances', 'would', 'allow', 'filming', 'movie', 'be', 'convenient', 'inexpensive', 'was', 'case', 'then', 'did', 'reasonably', 'good', 'job', 'working', 'budgetary', 'constraints', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'reasonably', 'well', 'produced', 'However', 'major', 'flaw', 'movie', 'fathers', 'become', 'unrealistically', 'involved', 'Pinewood', 'Derby', 'competition', 'pretty', 'much', 'squeeze', 'kids', 'contest', 'movie', 'plot', 'twist', 'was', 'probably', 'included', 'mostly', 'way', 'expedite', 'filming', 'movie', 'quicker', 'easier', 'film', 'scenes', 'adults', 'children', 'so', 'director', 'took', 'bit', 'short', 'cut', 'here', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'similar', 'Kicking', 'Screaming', 'way', 'key', 'difference', 'adult', 'actors', 'Kicking', 'Screaming', 'were', 'able', 'compensate', 'deficiency', 'actors', 'Down', 'Derby', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'suited', 'role', 'supporting', 'plot', 'emphasized', 'kids', 'bit', 'more', 'not', 'say', 'adults', 'lacked', 'talent', 'performances', 'script', 'were', 'supplied', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'awkward', 'nature', 'story', 'being', 'said', 'still', 'rate', 'movie', 'three', 'stars']",Down and Derby

Although I was worried at first it might be second-rate and cheesy, it's really fun, enjoyable, and has tons of laugh-out-loud moments for parents and kids alike. My son, who is a Webelo Scout this year, though it was awesome, especially as we just had our own Pinewood Derby race last week!

Johnson,"[1, 1]","When Pinewood Derby time rolls around, the fathers of the troop go into competitive overdrive, seizing the car kits, and setting out to create the fastest car in the pack. Indeed, they lose all sense of proportion, and go to any and all lengths to win. But, it turns out that one father has a real edge - it seems that he quite literally wrote the Pinewood Derby Bible, and he made the all-time fastest Derby car. Argh! What can they do? What won't they do!I must say, I found this to be a very funny movie. I wasn't a Scout as a boy, but my son was, and I saw some pretty strange things at Derby time. (No tales out of school, though.) So, I really see the humor in this movie. Yes, it does take it to an extreme...a hilarious extreme!As a father of a Scout, I found the movie to be very funny. If I hadn't been a part of Pinewood Derby, I would maybe not find it quite so funny, so there is that. But, I did find the characters to be funny (especially Big Jimmy!), and the situation.

I know this movie is supposed to be a farce but it is so over the top as to make it stupid.  No dads are this selfish.

962511,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B000CSTKIS,Nicholas Carroll,"[19, 21]","Since I'm familiar with the Boy Scout subculture of adult volunteers being more enthusiastic than their own boys in scouting, I found many of the jokes right on target. It is a strange subculture too for anyone who is not a part of it or is new to scouting.While it played on only three screens in metro Atlanta during its run, and didn't even gross a million dollars nationally, I knew it was a direct-to-DVD type of film and didn't expect it to amount to much. However, I found the film to be much funnier than expected. It is essentially a situational comedy that you find in 30 minute installments on network television, but in a movie length 90 minutes. The actors and plot are sitcom-esque, which isn't bad and actually quite entertaining. I laughed more than I expected to and the story went in a direction I didn't expect.Basically, the plot is that one man feels inadequate ever since childhood when a newcomer displaced him from winning all childhood contests. The competition continues into adulthood when inexplicably, the three friends and the interloper all live on the same cul-de-sac. When their sons receive pinewood derby kits, the dads all have plans of their own to win once and for all. Comedic farce ensues. If you can stand sitcom-type humor, this movie will delightfully entertain you and it is the kind of film parents can watch with their children without embarrassing profanity or sex scenes. The only misadvertisement I saw in this film is that Pat ""Miyagi"" Morita is given a bigger billing than his cameo role. That's a shame. He should have had a bigger part for his final film.Anyone who has ever competed in the pinewood derby as a cub scout will probably enjoy this film as a nostalgic and funny tribute to the male competitive gene. I remember my own experience in how serious other boys took this race. For me, it was just fun to design my own car and see how it raced...but for others, winning is the only thing. This movie resolves itself in a very good way, making this film much better than I expected it to be.",4,Essentially an extended sitcom,1141776000,"03 8, 2006",2006,2050,"[""'m"", 'familiar', 'Boy', 'Scout', 'subculture', 'adult', 'volunteers', 'being', 'more', 'enthusiastic', 'own', 'boys', 'scouting', 'found', 'many', 'jokes', 'right', 'target', 'strange', 'subculture', 'too', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'part', 'new', 'scouting.While', 'played', 'only', 'three', 'screens', 'metro', 'Atlanta', 'run', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'gross', 'million', 'dollars', 'nationally', 'knew', 'was', 'direct-to-DVD', 'type', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'amount', 'much', 'However', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'much', 'funnier', 'expected', 'essentially', 'situational', 'comedy', 'find', '30', 'minute', 'installments', 'network', 'television', 'movie', 'length', '90', 'minutes', 'actors', 'plot', 'are', 'sitcom-esque', ""n't"", 'bad', 'actually', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'laughed', 'more', 'expected', 'story', 'went', 'direction', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect.Basically', 'plot', 'one', 'man', 'inadequate', 'ever', 'childhood', 'when', 'newcomer', 'displaced', 'winning', 'childhood', 'contests', 'competition', 'adulthood', 'when', 'inexplicably', 'three', 'friends', 'interloper', 'live', 'same', 'cul-de-sac', 'When', 'sons', 'receive', 'pinewood', 'derby', 'kits', 'dads', 'have', 'plans', 'own', 'win', 'once', 'Comedic', 'farce', 'ensues', 'can', 'stand', 'sitcom-type', 'humor', 'movie', 'will', 'delightfully', 'entertain', 'kind', 'film', 'parents', 'can', 'watch', 'children', 'embarrassing', 'profanity', 'sex', 'scenes', 'only', 'misadvertisement', 'saw', 'film', 'Pat', 'Miyagi', 'Morita', 'given', 'bigger', 'billing', 'cameo', 'role', 'shame', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'bigger', 'part', 'final', 'film.Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'competed', 'pinewood', 'derby', 'cub', 'scout', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'film', 'nostalgic', 'funny', 'tribute', 'male', 'competitive', 'gene', 'remember', 'own', 'experience', 'how', 'serious', 'other', 'boys', 'took', 'race', 'was', 'just', 'fun', 'design', 'own', 'car', 'see', 'how', 'raced', 'others', 'winning', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'way', 'making', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'be']",Down and Derby
