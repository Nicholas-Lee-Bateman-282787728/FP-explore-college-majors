What's nice about this set, aside from its inviting price and space-saving component, is the fact that 'Laramie' finally is offered on a single-sided picture disc containing only the widescreen version (Columbia's 1999 issue is a fullscreen/widescreen flipper).  Otherwise the transfer quality-- decent, though not great-- of both films and extra features are identical to those which appear on their original releases.",4,A good value...,1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,600,"[""'Man"", 'Laramie', 'time-tested', 'Mann-Stewart', 'classic', '4-plus', 'stars', 'psychologically-less-nuanced', 'enjoyable', 'western/drama', 'Charles', 'Vidor', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'What', 'nice', 'set', 'aside', 'inviting', 'price', 'space-saving', 'component', 'fact', ""'Laramie"", 'finally', 'offered', 'single-sided', 'picture', 'disc', 'containing', 'only', 'widescreen', 'version', 'Columbia', '1999', 'issue', 'fullscreen/widescreen', 'flipper', 'Otherwise', 'transfer', 'quality', 'decent', 'not', 'great', 'films', 'extra', 'features', 'are', 'identical', 'appear', 'original', 'releases']",N/A

Well, they are certainly not age restrained, so anyone enjoying a good western from the olden days can and will get enjoyment watching them both.I was born in 1943 (Desperadoes), so missed this one when originally released but saw it later on TV, while the Man From Laramie was on the screen when I was a teenager. A lot of things have changed since, one of them being that Hollywood for the most part has forgotten how to film a good western, and when an offer of two 'legends' of the screen come up any buckaroo worth their salt will just have to fork over.Don't miss these two from yesterday pards, they are well worth it, if you are a fan of the old west on the screen.Semper Fi.",5,LEGENDS:  BEST OF THE WEST,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,911,"['Desperadoes', '1943', 'Man', 'Laramie', '1955', 'dozen', 'years', 'apart', 'filming', 'are', 'well', 'suited', 'be', 'placed', 'same', 'DVD', 'box.Is', 'there', 'anyone', 'there', 'age', '30', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'two', 'movies', 'Well', 'are', 'certainly', 'not', 'age', 'restrained', 'anyone', 'enjoying', 'good', 'western', 'olden', 'days', 'can', 'will', 'get', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'both.I', 'was', 'born', '1943', 'Desperadoes', 'so', 'missed', 'one', 'when', 'originally', 'released', 'saw', 'later', 'TV', 'Man', 'Laramie', 'was', 'screen', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'lot', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'one', 'being', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'part', 'forgotten', 'how', 'film', 'good', 'western', 'when', 'offer', 'two', ""'legends"", 'screen', 'come', 'up', 'buckaroo', 'salt', 'will', 'just', 'have', 'fork', 'over.Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'two', 'yesterday', 'pards', 'are', 'well', 'are', 'fan', 'old', 'west', 'screen.Semper', 'Fi']",N/A

The movie was OK, but nothing great.  Arthur Kennedy basically reprises his role from Bend of the River, a mostly good guy who can't keep himself from doing some bad stuff.  Dave Wagaman, the son of the rancher, is really the bad guy so it makes no sense at the end when the rancher says Kennedy ""made Dave do it"".  The Desperadoes is OK.  It has a few laughs, but nothing great (except some the the riding during the stampede scene near the end).  Go ahead and buy this but don't expect to be blown away by the great stories.
