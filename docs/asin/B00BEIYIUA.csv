I lost count of the number of times I just didn't get what was going on. Where did those fences come from? Why did the big evil corporation leave Bob's exit pass on?And there are contrivances galore such as the convent amnesia and recovery of memory by Eden. The narration is often over the top and silly.Yet, it's not a horrible movie, it safely fits into the so bad it's good category. More often than not, their imagination of Upside Down Worlds lead to stunning visual effects. Even though our hero is constantly in over his head, there's something delightfully charming about his old mad dash. It's entertaining and enjoyable in its own right, if for nothing than all the questions it raises and never answers.So in conclusion, if you're going to see one movie about a cosmetic scientist on a dystopian world, make it this one.",3,Charmingly Stunningly Stupid,1392940800,"02 21, 2014",2014,959,"['Upside', 'Down', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'introduce', 'original', 'premise', 'ton', 'back', 'story', 'told', 'confusing', 'ways', 'lost', 'count', 'number', 'times', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Where', 'did', 'fences', 'come', 'Why', 'did', 'big', 'evil', 'corporation', 'leave', 'Bob', 'exit', 'pass', 'are', 'contrivances', 'galore', 'such', 'convent', 'amnesia', 'recovery', 'memory', 'Eden', 'narration', 'often', 'top', 'silly.Yet', 'not', 'horrible', 'movie', 'safely', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'category', 'More', 'often', 'not', 'imagination', 'Upside', 'Down', 'Worlds', 'lead', 'stunning', 'visual', 'effects', 'Even', 'hero', 'constantly', 'head', 'something', 'delightfully', 'charming', 'old', 'mad', 'dash', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'own', 'right', 'nothing', 'questions', 'never', 'answers.So', 'conclusion', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'one', 'movie', 'cosmetic', 'scientist', 'dystopian', 'world', 'make', 'one']",Upside Down

1628831,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00BEIYIUA,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","Just thought you might like to know that, if you didn't already.Some stories are not meant to be told on the big screen.  They are too convoluted, detailed and heavy handed.  You can usually tell right off the bat which films these are.  About ten seconds into `Upside Down' I told my wife that Juan Solanas was trying too hard and that this story would be better suited for a video game.  When you have to introduce your movie through voiceover by explaining rules to understanding your story then you know you're off to a bad start.`Upside Down', conceptually, is pretty interesting, but the first half is somewhat of a chore to get through and the simplistic afterthought of a love story becomes somewhat sketchy as Solanas starts breaking his own `rules' and pretty much throws his entire introduction out the window.Why do you have to make things so complicated only to lazily uncomplicated them?The story tells that of a poor kid named Adam who falls in love with a rich girl named Eden.  The `Romeo + Juliet' doomed relationship / Adam + Eve beginnings of creation aspects of this film are in full swing, and it becomes obvious by the films end that Juan Solanas is a dreamer and he wants us to be too.  I'm cool with that, to an extent.  Here's the trick, Adam and Eden cannot be together, not simply because Adam is deemed inferior and it is forbidden but because they physically cannot be together.  They live on twin worlds that are held together by dual gravity and so Adam walks on land beneath (or above depending on how you look at it) Eden.  Adam (or should I say, Jim Sturgess) explains all this in the intro and quite frankly it is tedious and complicated and, as I mentioned, was trying too hard.  The basic point is that if Adam goes to Eden's world he'll start to burn up and die.Still, they meet as children in this place where their worlds come together and they form a relationship only to have a tragic accident separate them for years.  Adam is determined to be with Eden, no matter the cost, and quite frankly that cost could be his life.Alright, the plot is thin, despite all the complicated details.  As I mentioned, Juan Solanas (who wrote and directed the film) is determined to create something unique and then he spends the better part of the second half of the film trying to skirt around his own creation.  The `burning up' aspect of transferring to the other world is a big hole in this plot because the time frame surrounding the `burning' seems to change every time Adam goes over.  One time he starts to burn after a few minutes, the next time hours, the next time it's almost like he never burns.  Then you have the `plot within a plot' regarding conjoining their gravity, which is interesting but underdeveloped.Couple this with the fact that the film feels about twice as long as it really is, and you have a bad thing.But there is good here.Set aside the poor scripting, the underdeveloped plot and the lackluster acting (why is Jim Sturgess squandering his potential by continuously playing the lovelorn Romeo?) and you have a richly textured fantasy world that is mind-blowing in execution.  I'm serious when I say that these graphics are the best I've seen in film in YEARS, maybe ever.  The dual worlds, hanging above (and below) one another are seamlessly created and strung before us, and the visual depth of these sequences are astounding.  In fact, the whole technical side of this film, from the sets to the score to the beautiful cinematography are near perfection.  I've never wished so badly that a film was better than it was, because I'd love to look at it again and yet the idea of watching it a second time makes me anxious.",2,Hanging upside down for too long will give you a headache...,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,3683,"['Just', 'thought', 'might', 'like', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'already.Some', 'stories', 'are', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'told', 'big', 'screen', 'are', 'too', 'convoluted', 'detailed', 'heavy', 'handed', 'can', 'usually', 'tell', 'right', 'bat', 'are', 'ten', 'seconds', 'Upside', 'Down', 'told', 'wife', 'Juan', 'Solanas', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'suited', 'video', 'game', 'When', 'have', 'introduce', 'movie', 'voiceover', 'explaining', 'rules', 'understanding', 'story', 'then', 'know', ""'re"", 'bad', 'start.', 'Upside', 'Down', 'conceptually', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'first', 'half', 'somewhat', 'chore', 'get', 'simplistic', 'afterthought', 'love', 'story', 'somewhat', 'sketchy', 'Solanas', 'breaking', 'own', 'rules', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'introduction', 'window.Why', 'do', 'have', 'make', 'things', 'so', 'complicated', 'only', 'lazily', 'uncomplicated', 'story', 'poor', 'kid', 'named', 'Adam', 'who', 'love', 'rich', 'girl', 'named', 'Eden', 'Romeo', '+', 'Juliet', 'doomed', 'relationship', '/', 'Adam', '+', 'Eve', 'beginnings', 'creation', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'full', 'swing', 'obvious', 'films', 'end', 'Juan', 'Solanas', 'dreamer', 'be', 'too', ""'m"", 'cool', 'extent', 'Here', 'trick', 'Adam', 'Eden', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'together', 'not', 'simply', 'Adam', 'deemed', 'inferior', 'forbidden', 'physically', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'together', 'live', 'twin', 'worlds', 'are', 'held', 'together', 'dual', 'gravity', 'so', 'Adam', 'walks', 'land', 'beneath', 'depending', 'how', 'look', 'Eden', 'Adam', 'should', 'say', 'Jim', 'Sturgess', 'intro', 'quite', 'frankly', 'tedious', 'complicated', 'mentioned', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'basic', 'point', 'Adam', 'Eden', 'world', ""'ll"", 'start', 'burn', 'up', 'die.Still', 'meet', 'children', 'place', 'where', 'worlds', 'come', 'together', 'form', 'relationship', 'only', 'have', 'tragic', 'accident', 'separate', 'years', 'Adam', 'determined', 'be', 'Eden', 'matter', 'cost', 'quite', 'frankly', 'cost', 'could', 'be', 'life.Alright', 'plot', 'thin', 'complicated', 'details', 'mentioned', 'Juan', 'Solanas', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'determined', 'create', 'something', 'unique', 'then', 'better', 'part', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'trying', 'skirt', 'around', 'own', 'creation', 'burning', 'up', 'aspect', 'transferring', 'other', 'world', 'big', 'hole', 'plot', 'time', 'frame', 'surrounding', 'burning', 'change', 'time', 'Adam', 'One', 'time', 'burn', 'few', 'minutes', 'next', 'time', 'hours', 'next', 'time', 'almost', 'never', 'Then', 'have', 'plot', 'plot', 'regarding', 'conjoining', 'gravity', 'interesting', 'underdeveloped.Couple', 'fact', 'film', 'feels', 'twice', 'as', 'long', 'really', 'have', 'bad', 'thing.But', 'good', 'here.Set', 'poor', 'scripting', 'underdeveloped', 'plot', 'lackluster', 'acting', 'why', 'Jim', 'Sturgess', 'squandering', 'potential', 'continuously', 'playing', 'lovelorn', 'Romeo', 'have', 'richly', 'textured', 'fantasy', 'world', 'mind-blowing', 'execution', ""'m"", 'serious', 'when', 'say', 'graphics', 'are', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'YEARS', 'maybe', 'ever', 'dual', 'worlds', 'hanging', 'one', 'are', 'seamlessly', 'created', 'strung', 'visual', 'depth', 'sequences', 'are', 'astounding', 'fact', 'whole', 'technical', 'side', 'film', 'sets', 'score', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'are', 'perfection', ""'ve"", 'never', 'wished', 'so', 'badly', 'film', 'was', 'better', 'was', ""'d"", 'love', 'look', 'again', 'yet', 'idea', 'watching', 'second', 'time', 'anxious']",Upside Down

The scoop here is twin worlds, floating side-by-side through the cosmos with inverse gravitational pulls. What's up for one is down for the other and all that jazz; certain mountaintops or skyscrapers venture close enough to actually touch the opposite landscape. A lot of time and effort is sunk into explaining this concept, which seems like wasted effort because not only is it mostly self-evident, but the finer laws (like the idea that matter from one world bursts into flames after an hour on the other) are often broken without consequence as the plot gradually develops. The film's best qualities are undoubtedly visual. A concept like this one will often live or die by how it's visualized on the screen and, despite never completely shaking a major case of disorientation, it's a dazzling, vivid, mesmerizing display that downright demands our attention. It's a real pity those visual heights couldn't find an equally interesting story to partner with, because Upside Down's plot is a real paint-by-numbers stinker. It's shallow, predictable, slow and empty, without a voice of its own.

Two worlds, the one on top has it good, the one down below is cruddy. Two star crossed lovers from each side come together against all odds, like a futuristic Romeo and Juliet. The most interesting part of the movie is the rules of gravity. If you come from below you are pulled to that side and if you were born above you are pulled to that side. There is a company called Tri-corp  that both side go to work, so you see people walking right-side up and upside down or visa versa or what-ever. It&#8217;s really weird and cool how they do it. Even objects from each side are pulled to the side of their origin. The visuals are pretty cool. At one point, Jim Sturgess has weights weighing him down to the top side and when he takes them off he flies up into the air and lands in the ocean on the other side.

The message is clearly that love is a greater power than gravity, with a subtext that a single soul can split in the Great Void and become two separate people who unknowingly will devote their entire lives to being reunited.  You have to believe in at least some of this philosophy; it's well worth the effort.It's a dark film with a golden heart, visually beautiful and romantically believable.  Jim Burgess (a terrific young British actor here using an American accent) lives on the impoverished world below, looking up at the world above, where Kristen Dunst lives.  They connected as children, were separated by circumstance, and discover each other through coincidences which necessitate scientist Burgess finding a way for them to be together despite physical and political boundaries that seem insurmountable.  This leads to a slightly awkward action theme of the upper earth bad guys trying to rip off Burgess' discoveries.  But how could a 3-D movie not involve action?I strongly recommend this film although I realize neither its theme nor its backdrop will appeal to everybody.

1628851,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B00BEIYIUA,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[4, 5]","Two different worlds exist right next to each other where all matter is pulled by the gravity of the world that it comes from, and not the other, an object's weight can be offset by matter from the opposite world (inverse matter), and after some time in contact, matter in contact with inverse matter burns. With such an interesting and unique dystopian sci-fi world you would think that Upside Down would be a compelling and entertaining film, but writer and director Juan Diego Solanas found a way to turn what could have been a good sci-fi film in Upside Down into a lifeless bore.Upside Down follows Adam (Jim Sturgess) who lives in the poverty stricken Down world. The Up world is the prosperous of the two worlds full of wealthy citizens and lords over the Down world controlling and using the Down world for its own benefit. Cross contact between the peoples of the world is outlawed and forbidden unless it is regulated by the Up world government. At a young age Adam sneaks into a restricted area and encounters Eden (Kirsten Dunst) who is from the Up world. The two quickly fall in love and spend many hours and days together until the very young couple is caught and separated never to be seen together again. Ten years later Adam is researcher scientist working on so sort of anti-gravity product that could change both worlds, but fate has other things in store for Adam as he sees Eden on television who now works for TransWorld an Up world corporation who controls much of the Up world. This new element sets Adam on a race to see his lost love, and sadly ruins what could have been a quality sci-fi film.With an interesting premise as two worlds right next to each other with two different gravity and types of world you would assume writer and director Juan Diego Solanas world focus on exploring the worlds, how they came to be, their histories and peoples creating a different film from what we are given, but instead Solanas decided to focus on the romance between Adam and Eden. The romance might have been more compelling if the characters, and their roles better performed by the actors playing them. The audience is supposed to root for Adam and his quest to reunite with Eden, but Adam is an uncharismatic bore which I blame both on the writing of Solanas and the acting of Jim Sturgess (Across the Universe, Cloud Atlas). Whatever Sturgess had in Across the Universe and Cloud Atlas he has lost here in his performance as Adam. Sturgess just lacks the charismatic charm and acting prowess to carry a film like Upside Down on his own. There is also Sturgess/Adam's lack of chemistry with Eden/ Kirsten Dunst which was just horrid to say the least. Kirsten Dunst (Original Spiderman trilogy, Interview with the Vampire and Wimbledon) has an empty shell of a character to work with in Eden. Solanas did not write Eden with a fully fleshed out backstory and the character pays for it. Plus Adam's and Eden's romance just is not believable with the characters and actors lack of chemistry. Dunst and Strugess had no chemistry what so ever which really hurt the film. Maybe if the film had a compelling and heart wrenching romance the film could have at least have been a decent romance film, but Upside Down completely fails at that. Usually if the stars of a film do not have what it takes to carry a film than the director and stars can count on the supporting cast to support them, but the supporting cast in Upside Down is nonexistent.For a modestly budgeted film the effects are pretty good as they do an effective job of showcasing the world Juan Diego Solanas has created highlighting who the two worlds and their gravities operate, and at certain points in the film the effects are really impressive. It is too bad that Solanas did not write an interesting story to go along with his unique world that he had created. Speaking of director Juan Diego Solanas, I believe the Argentina was out of his depth with Upside Down. The director is unknown to me, but I believe that if he had gotten help with the script and directing to bring his vision to life than Upside Down could have been a higher level of a film.When it comes down to it with Upside Down we are left with what could have been. If the film had a stronger narrative and better written characters that explored the unique sci-fi world and vision of Solanas than I believe Upside Down could have been a really remarkable sci-fi film, but instead what we have gotten is a terrible romance film with sci-fi elements in the back ground along with some good effects, bad acting, and even worse directing turn Upside Down into a unremarkable mess that audiences should just plan skip.",1,"Director Juan Diego Solanas created a unique sci-fi world, but unfortunately he could not add a compelling story or

1628853,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00BEIYIUA,J. Richardson,"[1, 1]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Wow, what a mess. Judging from the trailers, Upside Down had the potential to be really good. The concept of two worlds with opposite gravity is one that I've never seen before and it looked like a strong basis for a good story. Unfortunately, Upside Down never takes advantage of what it could have been because the entire film feels flat. The story, the acting, everything, it all feels so lifeless and dull. Add that to the fact that they do a very poor job of explaining how the gravity between these two worlds work and you have a mess of a film. I actually had to look up the rules of their gravity once the film was over to get a better understanding of how things worked. They tell you at the beginning of the movie, but they kind of blaze through it and it doesn't give you enough time to process because you haven't seen these rules in action yet.In the movie they kept saying that there were two worlds - Up Top and Down Below - but it never felt that way. Instead, it always felt like one world that was split in two halves which resulted in their gravitational pulls being switched. Tell me this, if two worlds really were circling around each other, would the people be able to see the towns and cities of the other world in detail? No, that wouldn't make sense. Well, would they be able to be connected through a huge corporate structure called TransWorld? No, that would require a really, really, really tall building. This is what I mean. Instead of labeling these as ""two worlds"", they could have come up with a solid back story for one world instead of not giving us anything for either of them. The only thing we truly know about these worlds is that Up Top is rich and prosperous while Down Below is poor and dirty.Upside Down follows the story of Adam (Jim Sturgess), a man who grew up in Down Below. As a child he met Eden (Kirsten Dunst), a girl from Up Above. It's law that people from Down Below are forbidden to speak to those from Up Above. Well, over time, these two gradually form a relationship until they eventually get caught. After a major fall, Adam doesn't see Eden for ten years. While at work one day he sees Eden on a game show and sets out to find her. It doesn't take long before he finds out that she is suffering from amnesia which is a result from her fall ten years ago. Adam's mission has now changed into a journey to win back the heart of the woman he loves all while not getting caught by the authorities.While I originally thought the romantic story between Adam and Eden looked captivating, I now realize that it made Upside Down wasted potential. Part of this is because Adam and Eden aren't terribly interesting characters. Not only that, but the scenario of two individuals being separated because of social class has been so overdone in film that in no longer seems to have any sort of impact on me. I found that I was more interested in the world and how it worked and I really didn't care about either of these characters. In fact, the only character I actually liked was Bob (Timothy Spall), an employee of TransWorld that Adam befriends. Sadly, he is only in the film for a few brief scenes.The things is, there were times where Upside Down embraced what it could have been. You'll find these occasional moments of brilliance during the films 107 minutes, but, sadly, there's not enough of it. There was a point towards the end where Adam was in Bob's house and they were mixing matter from both worlds to create a gravity resistant material. When I saw that my jaw literally dropped and I couldn't help but ask myself why there wasn't more intelligent, thought provoking scenes just like it. Everything goes back to the wasted potential and I feel like Upside Down could have been a brilliant film had it been done right.Don't get me wrong, Upside Down isn't all bad. Visually the film is gorgeous and I wouldn't have a problem saying that Upside Down's visuals are its strongest attribute. There's an obvious difference between these two ""worlds"" and I think the grey and yellow/gold contrast each other beautifully. My only complaint about the visuals is that, at times, I felt like Down Below was too bright. Whenever Adam was walking outside I found that I had to close my eyes because they began to hurt. It was really weird. I think part of this is because there's so much grey and white in the surrounding frame that it became slightly overwhelming. Other than that, though, the film is truly a thing of beauty when it comes to the world(s) these characters are inhabiting.Overall Score: 4.25/10 - Unfortunately, you need more than some pretty colors and landscapes to make a film enjoyable. Upside Down is another one of those films that attempts to do so much, but accomplishes so little. The plot was boring and, at times, predictable and the two leads weren't anything to write home about either. While Upside Down may have had a solid idea, it's brought down by a poor script and a somewhat generic story. I really wanted this film to work out in spite of all the negatives comments I read while watching the trailer, but that's not what happened. While I can't say that I would watch it again, I would recommend giving it a viewing on the visuals alone. While it may not be the best film in the world, it's one of the most visually beautiful movies I've seen in a while.",2,4.25/10 - Wasted Potential,1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,5392,"['Note', 'May',

1628862,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B00BEIYIUA,MadMacs,"[63, 79]","Eschewing the physics of reality, this film weaves a wonderfully fascinating tale of two young people in love. An astrophysics tale of Romeo and Juliet as the star-crossed lovers separated by a complex Escher-esque world of haves and have-nots.Jim Sturgess and Kirsten Dunst portray Adam and Eden respectively.Adam lives in the frigid, dirty, and dank oily world of Downbelow. While Eden's home is Uptop, a dreamlike existence of warm bright air and glittering palaces of light. Two planets who share every basic elemental aspect, but are divided by an unspoken social and fiscal chasm. But there are special places, natural features of great height, where the two worlds almost touch one another. A place like the Sage Mountains.A chance encounter between a thoughtful young boy and a young girl searching for her lost dog, accidentally bumping into one another at their respective peaks, begins a desperate dance as two halves of the same soul find, then lose one another.Like all children, they're born without hate in their hearts. Eden and Adam become friends. And as the years pass, become more than friends. Despite the monstrous illegality of their relationship, love blossoms in secret. Until one fateful day as the teen couple encounters a group of angry Downbelowers who attack the pair for their illicit romance. While helping Eden make her escape, Adam is shot. Losing his grip while attempting to lower her ""up"", the freefall drop ends with a sickening crunch. Striking solid stone as she crashes back onto her world, a widening pool of blood is the last image he has of her.Ten years pass.Now working as an electronics repairman with asides as an inventor, Adam unknowingly stands at the brink of a discovery that will revolutionize both worlds. Believing that his soulmate died on that fateful day, he goes through the motions of an infinitely empty existence. Until a pirated television program from Uptop catches his eye. It's her - she's alive. And he will do anything to again be with his one true love. Anything. Even prostitute his incredible creation to the corporate slave masters of Uptop's largest corporation, Transworld, for that single solitary chance.Finagling his way into and through Transworld - he's stunned and horrified to discover Eden doesn't know him.Nearly beyond words, he learns that the fall all those years ago caused blunt force amnesia; she has no memory of her childhood and teen years except when she sleeps and dreams.Undaunted, Adam undertakes the ultimate risk.The twin worlds' equivalent of a terrorist attack is to cross over without permission. A strictly forbidden act, permission is never ever granted. But he's going to cross over - repeatedly. His only hope is to encourage her memories to return by consistent re-association. But a Downbelower noticeably, and literally, stands out (up) from the crowd. As Uptop's gravity slowly burns through his illicit Up-gravity weights, Adam has to manage and mask his increasingly uncomfortable state while his custom bodysuit tips at the verge of combustion. And in a world full of Up citizenry, desperately has to avoid drawing public scrutiny to the fact that he's threatening immolation with every passing moment.Authorities from both sides are in hot pursuit, no pun intended, and closing in on the repetitious violator.A very entertaining romance for a 21st century audience. And, uncommonly, a good fit for both men and women, as this film captures the emotional aspects of a chick flick while carefully balancing the taut scifi and adventure aspects of a guy movie.There were a couple of very small weaknesses that prevents a full five stars, but this incredible visual feast is as strong a four as I can imagine.Movie Note:- Despite the fact the two planets share an equal orbit, I thought it cleverly profound that Director Juan Solanas never shows Downbelow as ""up"" when viewing the two worlds in the context of right and wrong, or even good and evil.",4,Escher-esque Romance,1360886400,"02 15, 2013",2013,3960,"['Eschewing', 'physics', 'reality', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'fascinating', 'tale', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'love', 'astrophysics', 'tale', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'separated', 'complex', 'Escher-esque', 'world', 'haves', 'have-nots.Jim', 'Sturgess', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'portray', 'Adam', 'Eden', 'respectively.Adam', 'lives', 'frigid', 'dirty', 'dank', 'oily', 'world', 'Downbelow', 'Eden', 'home', 'Uptop', 'dreamlike', 'existence', 'warm', 'bright', 'air', 'glittering', 'palaces', 'light', 'Two', 'planets', 'who', 'share', 'basic', 'elemental', 'aspect', 'are', 'divided', 'unspoken', 'social', 'fiscal', 'chasm', 'are', 'special', 'places', 'natural', 'features', 'great', 'height', 'where', 'two', 'worlds', 'almost', 'touch', 'one', 'place', 'Sage', 'Mountains.A', 'chance', 'encounter', 'thoughtful', 'young', 'boy', 'young', 'girl', 'searching', 'lost', 'dog', 'accidentally', 'bumping', 'one', 'respective', 'peaks', 'desperate', 'dance', 'two', 'halves', 'same', 'soul', 'find', 'then', 'lose', 'one', 'children', ""'re"", 'born', 'hate', 'hearts', 'Eden', 'Adam', 'become', 'friends', 'years', 'pass', 'become', 'more', 'friends', 'monstrous', 'illegality', 'relationship', 'love', 'blossoms', 'secret', 'one', 'fateful', 'day', 'teen', 'couple', 'group', 'angry', 'Downbelowers', 'who', 'attack', 'pair', 'illicit', 'romance', 'helping', 'Eden', 'make', 'escape', 'Adam', 'shot', 'Losing', 'grip', 'attempting', 'lower', 'freefall', 'drop', 'sickening', 'crunch', 'Striking', 'solid', 'stone', 'back', 'world', 'widening', 'pool', 'blood', 'last', 'image', 'her.Ten', 'years', 'pass.Now', 'working', 'electronics', 'repairman', 'asides', 'inventor', 'Adam', 'unknowingly', 'brink', 'discovery', 'will', 'revolutionize', 'worlds', 'Believing', 'soulmate', 'died', 'fateful', 'day', 'motions', 'infinitely', 'empty', 'existence', 'pirated', 'television', 'program', 'Uptop', 'eye', 'alive', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'again', 'be', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'Anything', 'Even', 'prostitute', 'incredible', 'creation', 'corporate', 'slave', 'masters', 'Uptop', 'largest', 'corporation', 'Transworld', 'single', 'solitary', 'chance.Finagling', 'way', 'Transworld', 'stunned', 'horrified', 'discover', 'Eden', ""n't"", 'know', 'him.Nearly', 'words', 'fall', 'years', 'ago', 'caused', 'blunt', 'force', 'amnesia', 'memory', 'childhood', 'teen', 'years', 'when', 'sleeps', 'dreams.Undaunted', 'Adam', 'ultimate', 'risk.The', 'twin', 'worlds', 'equivalent', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'cross', 'permission', 'strictly', 'forbidden', 'act', 'permission', 'never', 'ever', 'granted', 'going', 'cross', 'repeatedly', 'only', 'hope', 'encourage', 'memories', 'return', 'consistent', 're-association', 'Downbelower', 'noticeably', 'literally', 'out', 'up', 'crowd', 'Uptop', 'gravity', 'slowly', 'illicit', 'Up-gravity', 'weights', 'Adam', 'manage', 'mask', 'increasingly', 'uncomfortable', 'state', 'custom', 'bodysuit', 'tips', 'verge', 'combustion', 'world', 'full', 'Up', 'citizenry', 'desperately', 'avoid', 'drawing', 'public', 'scrutiny', 'fact', 'threatening', 'immolation', 'passing', 'moment.Authorities', 'sides', 'are', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'pun', 'intended', 'closing', 'repetitious', 'violator.A', 'very', 'entertaining', 'romance', '21st', 'century', 'audience', 'uncommonly', 'good', 'fit', 'men', 'women', 'film', 'emotional', 'aspects', 'chick', 'flick', 'carefully', 'balancing', 'taut', 'scifi', 'adventure', 'aspects', 'guy', 'were', 'couple', 'very', 'small', 'weaknesses', 'full', 'five', 'stars', 'incredible', 'visual', 'feast', 'strong', 'four', 'can', 'imagine.Movie', 'Note', 'fact', 'two', 'planets', 'share', 'equal', 'orbit', 'thought', 'cleverly', 'profound', 'Director', 'Juan', 'Solanas', 'never', 'Downbelow', 'when', 'viewing', 'two', 'worlds', 'context', 'right', 'wrong', 'even', 'good', 'evil']",Upside Down

Unfortunately this film by Juan Solanas has the visual gravitas but lacks interesting leads and a script that led me to shaking my head.Actually more of a fantasy than sci-fi, there are two worlds, twins if you will, that apparently rotate together in orbit but a few feet apart.  Each has its own gravity, so in a common office scene, the people above you appear upside down.  Each world has its own political and cultural system as well.  One world is inhabited by the working class.  It is ugly, mostly barren and in need of an influx of capital.  The other world in controlled by a giant corporation and is where the wealthy live.Travel between the two worlds is prohibited and physically problematic otherwise.  Young Adam (Jim Sturgess) likes to scramble to the highest peak, never mind how he manages to get there.  He meets a young woman named...wait for it...Eden (Kirsten Dunst) who also likes to hike to this same peak but on the wealthy world.  Recalling Dunst's upside down kiss with Spider-Man, the couple manages to hook up this way until they are discovered by the authorities.As the years pass, Adam discovers that Eden was working for the corporation bad guys.  He had thought she was killed during that earlier confrontation with the cops.  Nope.  Just lost her memory.  As luck would have it, Adam is also a top notch chemist and has discovered an anti-aging cream that gets him a slot at the corporation.  This of course, gives him the opportunity to reconnect with Eden.While this might sound interesting, it isn't.  Dunst and Sturgess do what they can with the lame script but their relationship is boring as hell.  At the end of the film Eden tells Adam that she is having twins, I'm thinking when the hell did that happen?

I figured this wasn't going to play very long here so I went to see it right away.""Upside Down"" has a very intruiging premise: there are two worlds very close together but each with their own gravity. As the movie opens, we are informed of the basic three rules: 1. All matter is pulled by the gravity of the world that it comes from, and not the other. 2. An object's weight can be offset by matter from the opposite world (inverse matter). 3. After some time in contact, matter in contact with inverse matter burns. Wow, get your head around that! As the movie opens, we see young/eventual teenagers Adam (played by Jim Sturgess) and Eden (played by Kirsten Dunst) find each other in striking distance from opposing sides of a high mountain. Adam pulls in Eden with a rope, and as Eden is hanging/resting upside down in a rock, they kiss (hello, Spiderman upside-down kiss replay, anyone?). Eventually they are found out and as Eden is trying to get back to her ""Up"" world, the rope is shot and she takes a bad tumble, causing amnesia. Fast forward 10 years, and by complete chance Adam (from the ""Down"" world) see that Eden is now working at TransWorld, the 'evil' company that controls everything. Adam is developing an ""anti-gravity"" matter that also serves as an ""anti-aging"" creme. That appeals to TransWorld and he gets hired. Adam is bent on finding Eden and reconnecting with her, even though she has no memory of him and her teenage romance with him. At this point we are not even half-way into the movie, but to tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several commments: first and foremost, this movie is the most visual original movie that I have seen in a long, long time. It is slightly reminiscent of ""Inception"" in its visuals, but then does it one or two times better than that, just outstanding. I just couldn't stop marveling at how the images of the two ""upside down"" worlds were presented to us. That said, I thought that Sturgess was badly miscast as Adam. Even though he is in reality older than Dunst, he just looked like a boy next to her. On the other hand, Dunst just shines in this movie, continuing her strong streak in recent movies like Melancholia and Bachelorette. Kudos also for the nice soundtrack, scored by Mark Isham, a favorite of mine. The screening that I saw this at today here in Cincinnati was poorly attended (only 2 people besides myself), so if you get a chance to see this in the theatre, do not wait, or otherwise catch it on DVD.

A more accurate way to put it, perhaps, is to say that he lives in a ""lower"" world, while a ""higher"" world - which looks much like his world, only upside down - hangs above his head at all times. And if you're having a hard time envisioning what it is I`m describing, then I guess you'll just have to watch ""Upside Down"" for yourself to get the full picture. And what a picture it makes, as Adam falls in forbidden love with a girl from this reverse-gravity place, a land where all the wealthy people live and which is run by an all-powerful vulture corporation that literally looks down on the people below and runs their lives as much as possible - making this perhaps the farthest-out take on ""Romeo and Juliet"" ever put on film.Adam decides to go to work for the TransWorld Corporation when he finds out that his Juliet, known as Eden, works there. The problem he has in getting together with her is twofold: 1) she is suffering from amnesia as a result of an accident and no longer remembers him, and 2) it is virtually impossible for anyone from the bottom world to cross over to the top one without being detected and summarily punished for the violation. Bob has also invented an anti-wrinkle cream based on the principles of anti-gravity that he hopes to market to the world above. But his main reason for being there is to reconnect with the woman he loves (and don`t think the two characters don`t wind up living up to their allegorical names in the end).Written and directed by Juan Solanis, the French/Canadian ""Upside Down"" is one of those rare science fiction films that actually expands the limits of one's imagination.  Overflowing with you-really-have-to-see-it-to-believe-it art direction and visual effects, ""Upside Down"" takes us to a place we've never been to before and will likely never see again. It's simply that unique and visionary.Jim Sturgess and Kirsten Duntz are utterly winning, charming and engaging as the couple caught between two opposing gravitational forces, and Timothy Spall is equally fine as Adam's co-worker from the upper world who befriends this starry-eyed newbie from below. And even amidst all the dystopic ""Brave New World""/""1984""/""Fahrenhiet 451"" - style tropes and trappings, Solanis has managed to create one of the most thoroughly captivating love stories we've encountered in quite some time.A movie not to be missed, and, when once seen, never to be forgotten!",4,A Visionary Film,1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,2539,"['****1/2Adam', 'world', 'quite', 'literally', 'upside', 'down', 'right', 'side', 'up', 'depending', 'how', ""'re"", 'looking', 'more', 'accurate', 'way', 'put', 'perhaps', 'say', 'lower', 'world', 'higher', 'world', 'much', 'world', 'only', 'upside', 'down', 'hangs', 'head', 'times', ""'re"", 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'envisioning', 'what', 'm', 'describing', 'then', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'Upside', 'Down', 'get', 'full', 'picture', 'what', 'picture', 'Adam', 'forbidden', 'love', 'girl', 'reverse-gravity', 'place', 'land', 'where', 'wealthy', 'people', 'live', 'run', 'all-powerful', 'vulture', 'corporation', 'literally', 'down', 'people', 'runs', 'lives', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'making', 'perhaps', 'farthest-out', 'take', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'ever', 'put', 'film.Adam', 'decides', 'go', 'work', 'TransWorld', 'Corporation', 'when', 'out', 'Juliet', 'known', 'Eden', 'there', 'problem', 'getting', 'together', 'twofold', '1', 'suffering', 'amnesia', 'result', 'accident', 'longer', 'remembers', '2', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'anyone', 'bottom', 'world', 'cross', 'top', 'one', 'being', 'detected', 'summarily', 'punished', 'violation', 'Bob', 'also', 'invented', 'anti-wrinkle', 'cream', 'based', 'principles', 'anti-gravity', 'market', 'world', 'main', 'reason', 'being', 'reconnect', 'woman', 'don', 't', 'think', 'two', 'characters', 'don', 't', 'wind', 'up', 'living', 'up', 'allegorical', 'names', 'end', '.Written', 'directed', 'Juan', 'Solanis', 'French/Canadian', 'Upside', 'Down', 'one', 'rare', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'actually', 'limits', 'one', 'imagination', 'Overflowing', 'you-really-have-to-see-it-to-believe-it', 'art', 'direction', 'visual', 'effects', 'Upside', 'Down', 'place', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'will', 'likely', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'simply', 'unique', 'visionary.Jim', 'Sturgess', 'Kirsten', 'Duntz', 'are', 'utterly', 'winning', 'charming', 'engaging', 'couple', 'caught', 'two', 'opposing', 'gravitational', 'forces', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'equally', 'fine', 'Adam', 'co-worker', 'upper', 'world', 'who', 'starry-eyed', 'newbie', 'even', 'amidst', 'dystopic', 'Brave', 'New', 'World', '/', '1984', '/', 'Fahrenhiet', '451', 'style', 'tropes', 'trappings', 'Solanis', 'managed', 'create', 'one', 'most', 'thoroughly', 'captivating', 'love', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'quite', 'time.A', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'when', 'once', 'seen', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten']",Upside Down

People who are rich are attracted to the rich world. The poor live as mudlarks valuing anything from the rich world. A heartless corporation forms a link between the two worlds exploiting the poor for the sake of the rich. They rob them of their raw materials and sell back the manufactured product.The scenery and special effects was excellent. Kirsten Dunst's character Eden, was never developed.

In a twist that moves a very interesting and engaging premise even further than the usual disparity that the lovers have to overcome based on their different socio-economic class restrictions is that if either of them are to spend time with the other on the other's planet they will have to contend with their being lighter than that planet's gravity and always being pulled back to their planet.  Never mind that science would not allow this for one moment but sit back and enjoy the ingenious solutions and interactions that Adam and Eden have in overcoming this obstacle; this is a great deal of this film's charm and originality and while it might not ultimately blow your hair back it is by turns whimsical, full of tension and delight, and infused with a bit of pathos as is the film entire.

In this unique universe any communication between the rich ""Up Above"" and the poor ""Down Below"" is strictly forbidden. Also, it is physically impossible for the people of the Down planet to live on the other planet, and vice versa, because, due to the ""double gravity,"" they would be ""falling"" onto the ceiling.Adam (Jim Sturgess), inventive resident of Down, infiltrates a big company, disguising himself as an employee from Up, in order to meet again Eden (Kirsten Dunst), a girl from Up he met in the mountains ten years ago.The ""double gravity"" of the film is the force that divides the people into two. The stark contrast between the haves and have-nots is nothing new in sci-fi films these days (as seen in ""In Time"" and the new ""Total Recall""), but in ""Upside Down"" the conflict is visually presented by the upward/downward force.The interesting concept serves as a metaphor for social issues like North-South divide, but it becomes tiring pretty quickly.

I thought I'd give this one a miss but decided in the end to watch it anyway. I'm very glad I did!I suspect the low ratings are in part from going into this film with the wrong expectations. If you're looking for Sci-Fi, you expect things to make some sort of sense. This is not Sci-Fi. It's fantasy. It's a fairy tale. Just like comics, it's makes no logical sense. If you can accept that Superman can fly, the physical laws of this world shouldn't irritate you.It's definitely an artsy film. A bit slow and atmospheric, poetic and romantic. You have to set aside time to watch it, and you need to be in the right mindset.'Upside Down' is a dreamy film, with graphics that mix fantasy with cyberpunk. The story is about an oppressed world and their oppressors, kept apart by a harsh code that penalizes any transgressions with death, and the struggle of two people from the two different worlds to be together despite it all. It's not a dark and dystopian type film as this might sound. To the contrary, it leans towards the lighthearted.The characters were engaging and I was rooting for them throughout. I did wish that the lead actor, Jim Sturgess, would clean up, take a shower and shave. Timothy Spall's American accent was fake and jarring. He too needed a shower, desperately so. Kirsten Dunst, OTOH, was radiant (and clean!).It was a bit too sugary at times, but only for some bits. If you're looking for an action movie, this is probably not for you.
