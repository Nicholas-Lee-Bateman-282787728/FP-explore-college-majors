1015199,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B000HLDF9U,andy8047,"[24, 30]","The 1984-85 season,the seventh and final of CBS's The Dukes Of Hazzard is exactly the same,in the aspect of cast,as when it premiered in January 1979. Only Sonny Shroyer was not a regular at the time of premiere. The opening theme is exactly the same and the montage is exactly the same as seasons 4 and 6. The closing instrumental theme is exactly the same as seasons 4-6. Highlights from this season include a guest appearance by off-screen narrator,now-deceased country music artist Waylon Jennings. The composer and performer of the DOH theme plays himself. Deputy Enos Strate(Shroyer) was bodyguarding Jennings' trailer while Jennings was in Hazzard County for a concert or two. In HAPPY BIRTHDAY GENERAL LEE,Luke(Tom Wopat) and Bo(John Schneider) flashback to about a decade earlier when they first obtained the 1969 Dodge Charger that was named ""The General Lee"". Luke and Bo were falsely accused of some felonious crime and were taken to a penetentiary,much to the delight of Sheriff Roscoe Coltrane(James Best) and his brother-in-law Hazzard County Commissioner Jefferson Davis ""Boss"" Hogg(the late Sorrell Booke). A sick,hospitalized boy meets his idol,race car driver Cale Yarbrough,as himself. In ENOS & DAISY'S WEDDING,the second to last episode,Enos finally marries the woman he always loved,Daisy Duke(Catherine Bach). The wedding was never seen or subsequently mentioned. Two criminals are about to ruin the wedding but Luke and Bo thwart the criminals' plan and bring them to justice. Enos ends up with the measles toward the end of the episode. In the series finale,oddly entitled OPENING NIGHT AT THE BOAR'S NEST,which was written and directed by Schneider(credited as John R. Schneider),Luke,Bo and Daisy simulate Peter,Paul & Mary via two acoustic guitars played by Luke and Bo respectively. The trio provide entertainment at the Boar's Nest,the pub and short order restaurant owned and operated by Boss and where Daisy always worked at throughout the series. This obviously was a fund-raising event and in fact,the Dukes were given moral support by service station attendant Cooter Davenport(Ben Jones). The Dukes' Uncle Jesse(the late Denver Pyle) still had his farm and Roscoe still had his female basset hound Flash(""velvet ears""). Wopat and Schneider are country music artists themselves,each having recorded several albums of their own. The other episodes are great. CBS pulled the plug on two other hit series in 1985,those being Alice and The Jeffersons. Like the latter sitcom,DOH never had a special farewell episode because cancellation was never planned after this season. I'm sure Warner Bros.,DOH's production company wanted to continue for an eighth season but the cancellation decision was not made until summer 1985. DOH was killed by NBC's The Cosby Show and ABC's Who's The Boss(1984-85 was the first season for both series). Even ABC's Three's Company's not-too-successful spinoff Three's A Crowd was given the Nielsen axe after its only season in 1984-85. Also,NBC evicted Diff'rent Strokes from its prime-time roster and was moved to ABC. Post-DOH,Wopat and Schneider focused on their musical careers. Wopat had a recurring role on Cybill Shepherd's short-lived CBS sitcom,Cybill,as her ex-husband. Bach had one or two short-lived series of her own. She married and still is to Peter Lopez and they have two children together. Booke passed away in March 1994 of cancer. Jones became a politician,moved to Virginia and opened a store/nightclub called Cooter's. Best moved to Florida and became a college professor. Pyle succumbed to lung cancer at age 77 on Christmas Day 1997. He lived to appear in the first reunion movie,DUKES OF HAZZARD REUNION,first aired by CBS in April 1997. Daisy is now red-haired and drives a motorcycle. Roscoe became Hazzard County Commissioner,succeeding his brother-in-law(it was written that Boss Hogg passed away,as did Booke). Enos,Daisy's husband,is sheriff and Boss's cousin Cletus Hogg is deputy(Rick Hurst,a DOH regular in seasons 3-5 and recurring his role previously,was needed to fill the deputy's shoes). A second reunion movie premiered in 2000,which was much like the season 7 episode,THE DUKES IN HOLLYWOOD. In the second reunion movie,it was written that Uncle Jesse had passed away as did his portrayer. Jennings passed away in 2002 of complications from diabetes. He continued his musical career,post-DOH. In 2005,a theatrical film was released and distributed by WB,starring Johnny Knoxville,Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson. Simpson's role of Daisy was a blonde. None of the DOH series cast appeared in the film,though. Country star Willie Nelson was Uncle Jesse and performed the DOH theme in the final scene(he and Jennings were longtime friends). Oscar-winner Burt Reynolds was Boss Hogg,in spite of his moustache. I dedicate this item to the memories of Pyle,Booke and Jennings.",5,The final adventures of Hazzard County,1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,4881,"['1984-85', 'season', 'seventh', 'final', 'CBS', 'Dukes',

1015206,ABAZFH25304ZG,B000HLDF9U,John M Spangler,"[15, 20]","It's 1985 and the series has finally ran out of steam. I'm a dukes fan, always will be and people will probably tear me down for what I have to say. But I can't get into the later seasons of Hazzard and season 7 certainly came to an abrupt end. When you run into episodes concerning little green men visiting Hazzard county, you can't help to laugh and say, this series should have been over at the end of Season 2. Some of the storylines in this series are so bad, you might find yourself wanting to skip it all together. My biggest pet peave is that the ""realism"" died clearly after Season 2 was over. Season 1, (well, the first 5 episodes at least is 5 hours of pure entertainment. Those first 5 episodes within season 1, filmed directly in beautiful Covington Georiga, not on a Hollywood backlot in California, simply has a better feeling at being at a real-time locale.  The storylines, the writing, the realism of the show simply died and season 7 is clearly at the bottom of the barrel. And I am still annoyed by the projector screen backdrops in these later seasons. It's so fake it's almost laughable. Fans will clearly notice how it looked so much better when they were actually in the car with the camera on the hood of the car. It's those teeny added touches from Season 1 and 2 that are sorely missed and season 7 is no exception.Rosco ruined it for me even moreso in season 7 as his character basically turned into a bumbling baffoon and his stupidity got worse from season to season. No longer a corrupted sheriff, rosco evolved into a crybaby with no seriousness at all. The comedic atmosphere in the final seasons are wy over done. Seeing aliens visit form outerspace was enough to make me puke. I missed the awesome storylines, they clearly ran out of ideas. I know they went for the ""comedic"" route as the seasons progressed and wanted to make the series more family orientated, but why not stick with what made the original series so great.Sorrell Booke (Boss Hogg) basically got dumber too as the series has progressed. No longer a intelligent criminal politican, he's just another idiot by Rosco's side.The series last episode is a decent farewell to the series, but it's still illfades in comparison to the orignal episode in 1979.However, fans of the series should probably own every episode. Even though I'll probably watch this collection one last time, I always find myself going back to Season 1 where it all got started. The first 7 episodes are 7 hours of pure fresh fun from Hazzard and defintely shows how the show became so darn popular.",3,"After 140+ episodes, there is a reason the series lost it's YAHOO...",1167523200,"12 31, 2006",2006,2570,"['1985', 'series', 'finally', 'ran', 'steam', ""'m"", 'dukes', 'fan', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'people', 'will', 'probably', 'tear', 'down', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'later', 'seasons', 'Hazzard', 'season', '7', 'certainly', 'came', 'abrupt', 'end', 'When', 'run', 'episodes', 'concerning', 'little', 'green', 'men', 'visiting', 'Hazzard', 'county', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'say', 'series', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'end', 'Season', '2', 'storylines', 'series', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'might', 'find', 'wanting', 'skip', 'together', 'biggest', 'pet', 'peave', 'realism', 'died', 'clearly', 'Season', '2', 'was', 'over', 'Season', '1', 'well', 'first', '5', 'episodes', 'least', '5', 'hours', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'first', '5', 'episodes', 'season', '1', 'filmed', 'directly', 'beautiful', 'Covington', 'Georiga', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'backlot', 'California', 'simply', 'better', 'feeling', 'being', 'real-time', 'locale', 'storylines', 'writing', 'realism', 'show', 'simply', 'died', 'season', '7', 'clearly', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'am', 'still', 'annoyed', 'projector', 'screen', 'backdrops', 'later', 'seasons', 'so', 'fake', 'almost', 'laughable', 'Fans', 'will', 'clearly', 'notice', 'how', 'looked', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'when', 'were', 'actually', 'car', 'camera', 'hood', 'car', 'teeny', 'added', 'touches', 'Season', '1', '2', 'are', 'sorely', 'missed', 'season', '7', 'exception.Rosco', 'ruined', 'even', 'moreso', 'season', '7', 'character', 'basically', 'turned', 'bumbling', 'baffoon', 'stupidity', 'got', 'worse', 'season', 'season', 'No', 'longer', 'corrupted', 'sheriff', 'rosco', 'evolved', 'crybaby', 'seriousness', 'comedic', 'atmosphere', 'final', 'seasons', 'are', 'wy', 'done', 'Seeing', 'aliens', 'visit', 'form', 'outerspace', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'puke', 'missed', 'awesome', 'storylines', 'clearly', 'ran', 'ideas', 'know', 'went', 'comedic', 'route', 'seasons', 'progressed', 'wanted', 'make', 'series', 'more', 'family', 'orientated', 'why', 'not', 'stick', 'what', 'made', 'original', 'series', 'so', 'great.Sorrell', 'Booke', 'Boss', 'Hogg', 'basically', 'got', 'dumber', 'too', 'series', 'progressed', 'No', 'longer', 'intelligent', 'criminal', 'politican', 'just', 'idiot', 'Rosco', 'side.The', 'series', 'last', 'episode', 'decent', 'farewell', 'series', 'still', 'illfades', 'comparison', 'orignal', 'episode', '1979.However', 'fans', 'series', 'should', 'probably', 'own', 'episode', 'Even', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'watch', 'collection', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'always', 'find', 'going', 'back', 'Season', '1', 'where', 'got', 'started', 'first', '7', 'episodes', 'are', '7', 'hours', 'pure', 'fresh', 'fun', 'Hazzard', 'defintely', 'how', 'show', 'became', 'so', 'darn', 'popular']",N/A

1015217,A3C2HQOFO37TFN,B000HLDF9U,Pamela Walters,"[3, 6]","I will start off by saying I am a huge fan, and I don't remember much of Season 7 from when I watched it as a kid, and thank god. I bought this set to complete my collection, and since buying season 7 I have been kicking myself, and asking myself why I bothered to waste money on this garbage? I'm glad I paid such a low price because if I paid a lot, I would be kicking myself even harder. Anyway, onto the Dukes...I've loved the first 6 seasons up until this point, and I thought Season 6 is the best season by far. It had great action, great stories, and took a more serious turn, and ditched the whole cartoony kind of vibe that it had to it. It was still funny, and entertaining, but with a serious edge to it, so I was expecting Season 7 to continue in that direction.BOY WAS I WRONG! I am going to merely speculate here as to why the show ended in the way it did, so don't take any of this as fact, although I bet there is some truth to it.1-Storywise I think they couldn't come up with anything decent to write episodes about.2-Money was becoming a real problem with the series, so in order to save money, Warner Bros tells them to stop wrecking so many cars in the episodes because it's costing way too much, so they say, okay, we'll use miniatures to do the jumps, and no one will notice. Yeah, sure to a little kid they might not notice, but I seen one shot of it, and knew right away that it was a complete joke! It wasn't even funny, or believable for a second. First of all the car didn't even look real, and neither did the scenery. He jumps over a helicopter, and a grain elevator? I mean come on! The helicopter didn't even look as real as a remote control helicopter, which is sad. You see the car land, and nothing breaks or anything, the car just kinda bounces. YEAH, LIKE THAT'S BELIEVABLE! I think if they were worried about money they should have just cancelled the show where they stood.3-The Episodes themselves had a bit of substance, but not enough for you to really care what was going on. Since they cut the season short, it really makes me wonder why they even bothered making 17 episodes? They should have said at the end of season 6, okay, we're done! I did like some parts of the season however, like Happy Birthday General Lee. It was a good episode. It would have been a way better episode if they had've replaced the cheesy model car jumps and replaced it with old footage from older episodes like they did throughout the series. I used to complain about the fact that they would use old jump footage, or shots from old episodes, even though they didn't match. Like when they would show a shot of the old cop car that hasn't been used since season 1, and they expected us not to notice. Now that I see this though, I would think twice about complaining about that now.I think this season is only worth maybe 15-20 dollars tops. Anything more, and it's not really worth it. I'm glad they lowered the price of it because it's not worth no 40 bucks. I recommend this set just to finish your Dukes Of Hazzard collection, but from an entertainment standpoint, don't expect to be too entertained with this season if you like the show for the stunts. I always thought the stunts on the show were top notch, and it really brought out the best in the show, and with one fowl swoop, they ruined it with season 7. Really a sad end for such a great show.I hate to give such a great show a 1 rating, but this season IS BAD! I recommend season 6 to any Die Hard Dukes Fan. Season 6 is the bomb! Episodes like Lulu's Gone Away is what Dukes is all about in my humble opinion. Great Action, Great Stunts, Great Storytelling, Great Suspense, and Great Comedy from Boss and Rosco. WB should be ashamed of themselves for ruining such a great show that had the potential to go on for at least a few more seasons if they would have done it right.",1,PATHETIC! Worst Season yet!

It has been so much fun reliving the series through Warner Bros. DVD collection of the entire run of the Dukes Of Hazzard.  Although season 7 had it's share of problems, it's still right up there with some of the best television you can find.  There were a few episodes that were extra cheesy, such as ""Robot P. Coltrane"" and ""Strange Visitor To Hazzard"" and most of this season was riddled with the ridiculously cheap looking car stunts performed by miniature models of the General Lee and the Sheriff's patrol cars.  However, I did find myself getting a little emotional on the final episode, knowing that this was the last time that The Duke boys would drive and jump the General Lee and this would be the last time that Rosco would cut loose with one of his patented coo coo coo's.  The final scene of the last episode when a distraught Rosco was tearfully talking to his fat little buddy, after he believed he made him disappear permanently further convinces me that James Best is one of the best an most versatile actors I have ever seen.  If you are any kind of Dukes fan, you must cap off your collection with this final season.  The only thing that would make this ride sweeter is if they would release the 2 reunion movies on DVD and also if the Dukes got together for one more go-around.

1015221,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B000HLDF9U,Taheen Lopez,"[2, 2]","This abbreviated 1984-85 Season of the DUKES OF HAZZARD was the last & final season as well as the season when the Dukes tanked after its 6-year run on CBS.Even though the DUKES OF HAZZARD's 7th Season was okay, this show was obviously dying and becoming very stale since the Dukes were obviously getting tired and losing their touch in this season, since it was almost identical to the Dukes 6th Season and part of the Dukes 5th Season with no new characters, no new co-stars, and no new introduction on top of that along with the fact that the DUKES OF HAZZARD's honeymoon phase of the show was already long gone in this season and fading away more and more in the last 3 seasons making the show weaker and weaker and going more and more downhill each time especially since KNIGHT RIDER was killing the Dukes during this shows last 3 seasons on CBS which were during KNIGHT RIDER's first 3 seasons on NBC.Therefore, the DUKES OF HAZZARDs Seventh Season was getting dull & seemed to be getting kind of like all the ROCKY movie sequels, THE KARATE KID movie sequels, all the Van-Damme movies, etc., which made the action on the show become semi-predictable of what would end up happening in the Dukes 1984-85 Season, since nothing really changed anymore, because the scheming Commisioner Boss Hogg(Sorrell Booke) and Corrupt Sheriff Roscoe(Jim Best) seemed to have gotten dumber & more predictable especially to the Dukes, especially since this was the 7th year for the Dukes, which didn't make a whole lot of sense, because you would think Boss and Roscoe would've become smarter, wiser, more cautious, and more conscientious instead of stupider every year, especially after being stiffed too many times like Rockford(James Garner)had on the ROCKFORD FILES and you would think that Boss & Roscoe would've learned by now after nearly getting killed so many times by various thugs throughout the Dukes whole 7-year run on CBS, but Boss and Roscoe still never did, not even after 7 seasons, plus I noticed Cooter(Ben Jones) started appearing less and less often in this season too since he was probably getting bored with the show and running out of steam like every one else on this show, especially since this 1984-1985 Season was even weaker than the Dukes 5th Season was.Therefore, the DUKES OF HAZZARD ran out of gas in this season as if it were reaching a saturation point and the General Lee was getting sluggish and wasn't nearly as sharp or as impressive as it was during it's first 5 seasons, plus the General Lee started running kind of ragged and literally seemed to be losing its pep and horsepower as if it was time to retire it since the General Lee was getting a lot older along with the fact that the General Lee was already a '69 Dodge Charger, which already made the General Lee a classic when THE DUKES OF HAZZARD premiered on CBS in the Winter of 1979.Therefore, you could say that the DUKES OF HAZZARDs Seventh Season was the weakest and least successful season of them all throughout it's whole 6-year run on CBS, even though it still had Bo(John Schneider) and Luke(Tom Wopat) in it, but I think part of the reason why the DUKES OF HAZZARD went downhill in this season was especially due to the fact that this show wasn't nearly as popular in this 1984-85 Season as it was during the Dukes first few seasons when the Dukes were obviously still in their honeymoon phase of this show.Therefore, I think the DUKES OF HAZZARD's 4th Season was probably the last real solid season of this show before it started losing it's touch and when I like many other people started watching the DUKES OF HAZZARD less and less each year every Friday night on CBS's Friday night line-up, especially between Coy and Vance Duke replacing Bo and Luke Duke in the first half of the Dukes 5th Season and then the episodes becoming even less sophisticated with everyone on the show getting burned out by the 7th Season and the 6th Season of the Dukes seemed to be just barely making it with sufficient ratings to keep the show afloat, since the 1983-84 Season of the Dukes was the first full season with Bo and Luke since their departure of the show, and KNIGHT RIDER coming out on NBC in the Fall of 1982 along with the fact that KNIGHT RIDER was still doing good in the ratings when the DUKES OF HAZZARD was in it's 7th Season, which was when KNIGHT RIDER was in it's 3rd Season.Except KNIGHT RIDER had continued to sustain it's touch and remained strong with the ratings in its honeymoon phase while the DUKES OF HAZZARD was starting to flop in the ratings since the Dukes honeymoon phase of the show was already dying by the Autumn of 1982 along with the fact that KITT was more upgraded with more features in it's Third Season, but the General Lee was still the same old car that was just simply getting older with no improvements or upgrades on it in the Dukes Seventh Season, which basically resulted in KNIGHT RIDER K.O.ing the DUKES OF HAZZARD again.In addition to what resulted in CBS cancelling the DUKES OF HAZZARD in February of 1985 and cutting this season short after only 17 episodes; all these Seventh Season episodes were a lot less funny, all the comedy scenes and actions on the show were overdone and out of style, plus the episodes in this season seemed to be getting more and more fake and a lot less sophisticated like in the ""Strange Visitor To Hazzard"", ""Robot P. Coltrane"", ""Happy Birthday General Lee"", plus Bo and Luke and the General Lee along with the rest of the cast and crew of the DUKES OF HAZZARD  seemed to all be getting burned out along with the fact that this show seemed to be running out of gas with no more hope left as if it were time to retire both the Dukes and the General Lee, especially since Bo and Luke nor the General Lee weren't nearly as impressive as it used to be as if the show and the General Lee was dying and going out of style along with the fact that Bo and Luke were obviously getting tired and all the stunts with the General Lee were getting boring and seemed to be getting phonier and phonier and a lot less impressive, which I'm sure was part of the reason why CBS had cut this season short in the Winter of 1985 along with the fact that this show was no longer going in the right direction either along with the fact that KNIGHT RIDER and other newer shows like STREET HAWK had already stole the Dukes thunder in the last 3 seasons of this show on top of that leaving no more hope for THE DUKES OF HAZZARD after its whole 1979-85 run on CBS.Additionally; this DVD didn't provide Closed Captioning in DVD mode in English, but only Closed Captioning were able to be provided in television mode, unlike how Warner Bros. did it with the first 5 seasons of THE DUKES OF HAZZARD.Therefore, I don't see why Warner Bros. got kind of lazy by not providing subtitles in English with the Sixth and Seventh Season DUKES OF HAZZARD DVD's, because Universal didn't with any of their DVD's.It was also interesting seeing guest stars like*Morgan Woodward in the ""Cool Hands, Bo & Luke"" episode during his co-starring days on DALLAS*Michael Fairman in the ""Enos & Daisy's Wedding"" episode before his co-starring days on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS and after his co-starring days as Mr. Heller on the short-lived series THE POWERS OF MATTHEW STAR*Barry Van-Dyke in ""The Dukes In Hollywood"" episode before his co-starring days as Stringellow Hawke's(Jan-Michael Vincent) long lost MIA baby brother(St. John Hawke)on the new AIRWOLF*Dennis Haskins in the ""Cale Yarborough Comes To Hazzard"" episode before his co-starring days as Mr. Belding on SAVED BY THE BELL*Felix Silla in the ""Strange Visitor To Hazzard"" episode after his co-starring days as Twiki on BUCK ROGERS*Waylon Jennings making his first cameo appearance role in the ""Welcome Waylon Jennings"" episodeThe Dukes 7th Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I was still living in my hometown(El Centro, CA)at the time since I was raised in the boring Imperial Valley, which is a small rural community with very little to do for fun or entertainment, which was another reason why I would always look forward to watching the Dukes on CBS every Friday night since I never really had much to look forward most of the time throughout my whole 21 years of Imperial County residency.The original air-dates to each 19884-1985 Season are9/21/84: HAPPY BIRTHDAY GENERAL LEE9/28/84: WELCOME, WAYLON JENNINGS10/5/84: DR.
