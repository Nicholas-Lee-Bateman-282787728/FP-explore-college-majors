831116,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B0002DB5B8,A. Burchfield,"[13, 14]","I remember at the time that real earthquake scientists didn't know whether to laugh or cry when this one came out. I thought it did OK for a TV disaster drama with the usual divorced parents and their difficulties (except in this case Mom is governor of the state), the brilliant young scientist with the radical, but correct, theory about the quakes- and the tough boss who doesn't believe at first but comes to his senses and ultimately saves the day.I think the idea of deep faults has now been proven (the writers did say they did their research on the internet)but that idea of fusing them with nuclear blasts doesn't work for me, especially when done at depths of only a few hundred feet. I'd think that trying to fuse something like that would only make it worse either by REALLY cutting things loose or actually fusing and letting pressures build up even more.What sap would put an evacuee camp on a faultline as they did in this movie?, that was actually the dumbest thing in the whole thing.The FX were generally good although the quicksand that John Schneider got caught up in looked fake and the breakup of the Golden Gate Bridge did have a model look to it.",3,"standard TV disaster drama, great special effects",1105488000,"01 12, 2005",2005,1170,"['remember', 'time', 'real', 'earthquake', 'scientists', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'laugh', 'cry', 'when', 'one', 'came', 'thought', 'did', 'OK', 'TV', 'disaster', 'drama', 'usual', 'divorced', 'parents', 'difficulties', 'case', 'Mom', 'governor', 'state', 'brilliant', 'young', 'scientist', 'radical', 'correct', 'theory', 'quakes-', 'tough', 'boss', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'first', 'senses', 'ultimately', 'day.I', 'think', 'idea', 'deep', 'faults', 'now', 'been', 'proven', 'writers', 'did', 'say', 'did', 'research', 'internet', 'idea', 'fusing', 'nuclear', 'blasts', ""n't"", 'work', 'especially', 'when', 'done', 'depths', 'only', 'few', 'hundred', 'feet', ""'d"", 'think', 'trying', 'fuse', 'something', 'would', 'only', 'make', 'worse', 'REALLY', 'cutting', 'things', 'loose', 'actually', 'fusing', 'letting', 'pressures', 'build', 'up', 'even', 'more.What', 'sap', 'would', 'put', 'evacuee', 'camp', 'faultline', 'did', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'dumbest', 'thing', 'whole', 'thing.The', 'FX', 'were', 'generally', 'good', 'quicksand', 'John', 'Schneider', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'looked', 'fake', 'breakup', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'did', 'have', 'model', 'look']",10.5
831117,A39FKP35OY8VM2,B0002DB5B8,Adam,"[1, 3]","After hearing some hype about this movie, I thought it might be a good film to watch on a lazy Saturday afternoon.  ""Disaster"" flicks were popular when I was growing up (Volcano, Dante's Peak, Asteroid, etc.), so I've learned a suspend a little disbelief over the years.  This film, however, was hardly worth the time.My first dislike was the fact that this ""disaster"" was scientifically impossible.  Again, when it comes to disaster films, one must suspend a little disbelief, but this film blantly disregarded geological science.  I'm not a geologist personally, but I've taken college-level courses in that field and know plenty of geologists who are practically crying because of the impossibility of ""chain reaction"" earthquakes tearing California off the coast.  Yeah, okay, some may say that ""nothing in science is for sure fact"", but this film is basically like writing a screenplay for a ""disaster"" where scientific experimentation has caused gravity to intensify seven fold unless the hero can find a way to reverse one of the universe's strongest forces.My second dislike was the acting and the dialogue.  None of the characters were memorable ones.  There was a dad and daughter in the forest, a wimpy president, his buddy who runs FEMA (before Katrina, clearly), some doctors, a few family members, a governor, two scientists, and state office assistants.  Believe it or not, are all tied together by three degrees of separation, everyone except some ridiculous bike guy who rides around, escaping a falling city around him.  None of their subplots were remarkably exciting.  The only way I could distinguish them was by knowing that some had worse acting than others.  There were some one-liners that I seriously wonder what agent would ever pick up a screenwriter who writes that kind of stuff (especially since I'm trying to find one myself and my writing is (I'm told) much better).The third dislike was the action and graphics.  On a scene where the Golden Gate Bridge is in trouble, the cars perched on there are clearly Matchbox cars, without a doubt in the world.  Watching them fall into the water had me laughing myself to tears.  The Seattle Space Needle collapse was poorly done through use of computer-aided graphics.  Even the cracks that formed from the quakes were too fake to let pass.  Granted, it was a low budget flick, but seriously.This movie made the classic movie mistake of overdoing the action sequences and underfilming them.  There are at least four scenes where the same 4-second shot is taken from different cameras to expand the time used to 16 seconds.  Additionally, some action sequences were occurring that weren't necessary.  For example, is it really necessary to show 15 car crash sequences when an earthquake occurs?  Wouldn't only 3 or 4 happen and then all drivers would be stopped?  Furthermore, how is it possible that all these scientists have such little time to solve the problem, but can create these amazing graphical presentations with flashing map images and beeping sounds?To summarize, most disaster flicks require one to suspend disbelief.  Some of these flicks, such as ""The Day After Tomorrow"", are reaches that could be assumed to happen if conditions were really, really bad.  This movie, however, was produced by someone who never consulted a geologist or even a first-year college student who took a mandatory geology course.  Coupled with weak actors, poor dialogue, and dry action sequences, 10.5 flops on its face.  If you're someone who likes campy 4-hour disaster movies and don't care if the science is accurate or not, then this would probably be a decent movie for you.  For the rest of us, you're better off spending that time doing something else.  I only give it 2 stars (vs. 1) because, as a writer, I can see that this script originally had hope and, had its screenwriting, dialogue, and actor choice been changed, it would have been much more successful.",2,Does anybody screen these things before or after production?,1207353600,"04 5, 2008",2008,3940,"['hearing', 'hype', 'movie', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'film', 'watch', 'lazy', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'Disaster', 'flicks', 'were', 'popular', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'Volcano', 'Dante', 'Peak', 'Asteroid', 'etc', 'so', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'suspend', 'little', 'disbelief', 'years', 'film', 'however', 'was', 'hardly', 'worth', 'time.My', 'first', 'dislike', 'was', 'fact', 'disaster', 'was', 'scientifically', 'impossible', 'Again', 'when', 'disaster', 'films', 'one', 'must', 'suspend', 'little', 'disbelief', 'film', 'blantly', 'disregarded', 'geological', 'science', ""'m"", 'not', 'geologist', 'personally', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'college-level', 'courses', 'field', 'know', 'plenty', 'geologists', 'who', 'are', 'practically', 'crying', 'impossibility', 'chain', 'reaction', 'earthquakes', 'tearing', 'California', 'coast', 'Yeah', 'okay', 'may', 'say', 'nothing', 'science', 'sure', 'fact', 'film', 'basically', 'like', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'disaster', 'where', 'scientific', 'experimentation', 'caused', 'gravity', 'intensify', 'seven', 'fold', 'hero', 'can', 'find', 'way', 'reverse', 'one', 'universe', 'strongest', 'forces.My', 'second', 'dislike', 'was', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'None', 'characters', 'were', 'memorable', 'ones', 'was', 'dad', 'daughter', 'forest', 'wimpy', 'president', 'buddy', 'who', 'FEMA', 'Katrina', 'clearly', 'doctors', 'few', 'family', 'members', 'governor', 'two', 'scientists', 'state', 'office', 'assistants', 'Believe', 'not', 'are', 'tied', 'together', 'three', 'degrees', 'separation', 'everyone', 'ridiculous', 'bike', 'guy', 'who', 'around', 'escaping', 'falling', 'city', 'around', 'None', 'subplots', 'were', 'remarkably', 'exciting', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'distinguish', 'was', 'knowing', 'had', 'worse', 'acting', 'others', 'were', 'one-liners', 'seriously', 'wonder', 'what', 'agent', 'would', 'ever', 'pick', 'up', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'kind', 'stuff', 'especially', ""'m"", 'trying', 'find', 'one', 'writing', ""'m"", 'told', 'much', 'better', '.The', 'third', 'dislike', 'was', 'action', 'graphics', 'scene', 'where', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'trouble', 'cars', 'perched', 'are', 'clearly', 'Matchbox', 'cars', 'doubt', 'world', 'Watching', 'fall', 'water', 'had', 'laughing', 'tears', 'Seattle', 'Space', 'Needle', 'collapse', 'was', 'poorly', 'done', 'use', 'computer-aided', 'graphics', 'Even', 'cracks', 'formed', 'quakes', 'were', 'too', 'fake', 'let', 'pass', 'Granted', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'flick', 'seriously.This', 'movie', 'made', 'classic', 'movie', 'mistake', 'overdoing', 'action', 'sequences', 'underfilming', 'are', 'least', 'four', 'scenes', 'where', 'same', '4-second', 'shot', 'taken', 'different', 'cameras', 'expand', 'time', 'used', '16', 'seconds', 'Additionally', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'occurring', 'were', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'example', 'really', 'necessary', 'show', '15', 'car', 'crash', 'sequences', 'when', 'earthquake', 'occurs', 'Would', ""n't"", 'only', '3', '4', 'happen', 'then', 'drivers', 'would', 'be', 'stopped', 'Furthermore', 'how', 'possible', 'scientists', 'have', 'such', 'little', 'time', 'solve', 'problem', 'can', 'create', 'amazing', 'graphical', 'presentations', 'flashing', 'map', 'images', 'beeping', 'sounds', 'summarize', 'most', 'disaster', 'flicks', 'require', 'one', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'flicks', 'such', 'Day', 'Tomorrow', 'are', 'could', 'be', 'assumed', 'happen', 'conditions', 'were', 'really', 'really', 'bad', 'movie', 'however', 'was', 'produced', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'consulted', 'geologist', 'even', 'first-year', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'took', 'mandatory', 'geology', 'course', 'Coupled', 'weak', 'actors', 'poor', 'dialogue', 'dry', 'action', 'sequences', '10.5', 'flops', 'face', ""'re"", 'someone', 'who', 'campy', '4-hour', 'disaster', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'science', 'accurate', 'not', 'then', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'decent', 'movie', 'rest', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'spending', 'time', 'doing', 'something', 'else', 'only', 'give', '2', 'stars', '1', 'because', 'writer', 'can', 'see', 'script', 'originally', 'had', 'hope', 'had', 'screenwriting', 'dialogue', 'actor', 'choice', 'been', 'changed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'successful']",10.5
831118,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0002DB5B8,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[7, 15]","What a tragic piece of television cinema this was.  When I use the word tragic, I am not referencing the events that took place in the actual story of the movie, but the way that this film was made.  It was hysterical, horrendous, and pathetic to think that there were actual paychecks handed out for this project.  The graphics looked like something pre-schoolers were asked to create using glue, paper mache, and their left over Hot Wheels cars.  Honestly, during one of the devastating scenes in this movie, I thought that I saw Hot Wheel on the bottom of one of the cars giving me a true indication of the low production value.  Let me just say that if 10.5 was a sandwich, than it would be heavy on the clich&eacute;s.  You could not turn away from this film for a minute for fear that you were going to miss yet another clich&eacute;d moment that has been used in nearly every disaster movie ever made.  From the acting to the story and even the graphics, everything seemed like it had been done before, and 10.5 times better.Our first image of this film sets the tone, but doesn't quite prepare us for the hilarity that will ensure further along in the movie.  As we witness a biker successfully manage his way through destruction without even a scratch, our idea of reality is lost.  Being able to outrun the Space Needle is sheer lunacy, and I will not go into the misleading way that they represented the Space Needle's structure (as most have in other reviews).  I was laughing while this scene was happening questioning my choice of this film.  Then, as if pulled from the pages of Sam Raimi's early work, we witness a train be completely eaten by the earthquake.  Paper mache in full effect, it is as if it is chasing the train in this horror story styled moment that leaves so much to be desired.  I couldn't tell if our characters were concerned about the tragedies that were befalling their state or the way that the director, John Lafia, represented the catastrophe with very cheap effects.I cannot merely say that the graphics are what ruined this film, because everything was equal.  The acting and the story were equally as poor giving us one of the largest (and lengthiest) television duds I have ever encountered.  Beau Bridges as this sympathetic President was horrible.  I could just see President Bush watching this movie at home and saying to himself, ""The earthquakes hate our freedom ... they are freedom-haters"".  I really could hear these words when I watched this film.  I mentioned Bridges, but the acting was bad on all counts.  The family dynamics that ironically all of our characters are fighting was a HUGE clich&eacute; that only created more implausibility to our story.  Oh, our lives are horrible, but a huge disaster like an earthquake could just bring everyone closer together ... let's watch and see!  There was one point when I thought that John Schneider was going to break a window to a car, jump into via the window, and speed away talking about how ""ain't no Boss Hog gonna git him"".  That would have been horrible, but at the same time semi-redeemable for this film.Finally, I need to say to everyone that was involved in this film and for future natural disaster filmmakers, nuclear power does not solve all of our problems.  I do not think we have harnessed the ability to stop Mother Nature from taking her course, and that no matter how hard we try, events will happen that will be catastrophic.  We need to realize that this Earth was here long before nuclear power, long before humans, and will be long after we are gone.  Sometimes I wish I could watch a film where the characters just allowed nature to take its course, and we could see the raw beauty of our world.  I hated the fact that this earthquake was this evil train-eating beast that needed to be tamed.  I felt that if earthquakes had a union, they would not be too pleased with their representation in this film.  I was hoping for some good acting, some decent graphics, and at least a story that would spark the interest, but instead I ended up with three goose eggs.Overall, if you can't tell already, I really disliked this film.  There was no redeeming value to it at all.  I remember friends and co-workers talking about this series when it was on television and how they couldn't wait to see the next part.  All I can say to them is that they need to get outside more often.  If 10.5 doesn't give you enough of a reason to throw your television out the window, then I don't know what will.  Avoid this film like the plague, and I promise you that your overall level of life comfort will be much better.  A definite Mr. Yuk sticker deserves to be placed on this film!Grade: * out of *****",1,Earthquakes hate our freedom ... they're freedom-haters!!,1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,4712,"['What', 'tragic', 'piece', 'television', 'cinema', 'was', 'When', 'use', 'word', 'tragic', 'am', 'not', 'referencing', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'actual', 'story', 'movie', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'hysterical', 'horrendous', 'pathetic', 'think', 'were', 'actual', 'paychecks', 'handed', 'out', 'project', 'graphics', 'looked', 'something', 'pre-schoolers', 'were', 'asked', 'create', 'using', 'glue', 'paper', 'mache', 'left', 'Hot', 'Wheels', 'cars', 'Honestly', 'one', 'devastating', 'scenes', 'movie', 'thought', 'saw', 'Hot', 'Wheel', 'bottom', 'one', 'cars', 'giving', 'true', 'indication', 'low', 'production', 'value', 'Let', 'just', 'say', '10.5', 'was', 'sandwich', 'would', 'be', 'heavy', 'clich', 'eacute', 'could', 'not', 'turn', 'away', 'film', 'minute', 'fear', 'were', 'going', 'miss', 'yet', 'clich', 'eacute', 'moment', 'been', 'used', 'nearly', 'disaster', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'acting', 'story', 'even', 'graphics', 'everything', 'seemed', 'had', 'been', 'done', '10.5', 'times', 'better.Our', 'first', 'image', 'film', 'tone', ""n't"", 'quite', 'prepare', 'hilarity', 'will', 'ensure', 'further', 'along', 'movie', 'witness', 'biker', 'successfully', 'manage', 'way', 'destruction', 'even', 'scratch', 'idea', 'reality', 'lost', 'Being', 'able', 'outrun', 'Space', 'Needle', 'sheer', 'lunacy', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'misleading', 'way', 'represented', 'Space', 'Needle', 'structure', 'most', 'have', 'other', 'reviews', 'was', 'laughing', 'scene', 'was', 'happening', 'questioning', 'choice', 'film', 'Then', 'pulled', 'pages', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'early', 'work', 'witness', 'train', 'be', 'completely', 'eaten', 'earthquake', 'Paper', 'mache', 'full', 'effect', 'chasing', 'train', 'horror', 'story', 'styled', 'moment', 'so', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'characters', 'were', 'concerned', 'tragedies', 'were', 'befalling', 'state', 'way', 'director', 'John', 'Lafia', 'represented', 'catastrophe', 'very', 'cheap', 'effects.I', 'can', 'not', 'merely', 'say', 'graphics', 'are', 'what', 'ruined', 'film', 'everything', 'was', 'equal', 'acting', 'story', 'were', 'equally', 'poor', 'giving', 'one', 'largest', 'lengthiest', 'television', 'duds', 'have', 'ever', 'encountered', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'sympathetic', 'President', 'was', 'horrible', 'could', 'just', 'see', 'President', 'Bush', 'watching', 'movie', 'home', 'saying', 'earthquakes', 'hate', 'freedom', 'are', 'freedom-haters', 'really', 'could', 'hear', 'words', 'when', 'watched', 'film', 'mentioned', 'Bridges', 'acting', 'was', 'bad', 'counts', 'family', 'dynamics', 'ironically', 'characters', 'are', 'fighting', 'was', 'HUGE', 'clich', 'eacute', 'only', 'created', 'more', 'implausibility', 'story', 'Oh', 'lives', 'are', 'horrible', 'huge', 'disaster', 'earthquake', 'could', 'just', 'bring', 'everyone', 'closer', 'together', 'let', 'watch', 'see', 'was', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'thought', 'John', 'Schneider', 'was', 'going', 'break', 'window', 'car', 'jump', 'window', 'speed', 'away', 'talking', 'how', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Boss', 'Hog', 'gon', 'git', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'horrible', 'same', 'time', 'semi-redeemable', 'film.Finally', 'need', 'say', 'everyone', 'was', 'involved', 'film', 'future', 'natural', 'disaster', 'filmmakers', 'nuclear', 'power', 'not', 'solve', 'problems', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'have', 'harnessed', 'ability', 'stop', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'taking', 'course', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'try', 'events', 'will', 'happen', 'will', 'be', 'catastrophic', 'need', 'realize', 'Earth', 'was', 'here', 'long', 'before', 'nuclear', 'power', 'long', 'before', 'humans', 'will', 'be', 'long', 'are', 'gone', 'Sometimes', 'wish', 'could', 'watch', 'film', 'where', 'characters', 'just', 'allowed', 'nature', 'take', 'course', 'could', 'see', 'raw', 'beauty', 'world', 'hated', 'fact', 'earthquake', 'was', 'evil', 'train-eating', 'beast', 'needed', 'be', 'tamed', 'felt', 'earthquakes', 'had', 'union', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'pleased', 'representation', 'film', 'was', 'hoping', 'good', 'acting', 'decent', 'graphics', 'least', 'story', 'would', 'spark', 'interest', 'instead', 'ended', 'up', 'three', 'goose', 'eggs.Overall', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'already', 'really', 'disliked', 'film', 'was', 'redeeming', 'value', 'remember', 'friends', 'co-workers', 'talking', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'television', 'how', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'next', 'part', 'can', 'say', 'need', 'get', 'more', 'often', '10.5', ""n't"", 'give', 'enough', 'reason', 'throw', 'television', 'window', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'will', 'Avoid', 'film', 'plague', 'promise', 'overall', 'level', 'life', 'comfort', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'definite', 'Mr.', 'Yuk', 'be', 'placed', 'film', 'Grade', '*', '*****']",10.5

831121,A2AOUHBZ1HXO5D,B0002DB5B8,Avantel,"[3, 6]","Gee, it was until I watched this movie when I became able to understand why some reviewers get so angry at some movies or novels. I had never seen characters as stupid, immature and obnoxious as the ones from this product. I've been open minded to several movies -you can see it in my reviews- but this one was too much, and this time I do agree with all reviewers who have disliked this product for the same reason I just mentioned. Do you think we are exaggerating? Check just two small pieces:-In one scene, a girl and her dad found a town buried by an earthquake. She insisted on hearing some music from the ground, so his dad went to search to look for people to help, but then she asked her dad why he went when there's nobody, and keept bothering all along. Did she have X-rays to see underground? Anyway, this perfectly rich-spoiled-brat would definitively win -if existed- the Jerk Nobel prize and graduate with top honors from PhD jerk studies from Harvard.-In another scene, the California's governor's top assistant gets her couple throwing a fir over the phone and calling her repeatedly about why they don't have children (or else, I don't care) while the earthquakes eat California and Washington.The movie starts with a big array of people acting up and demanding attention for themselves while caring nothing whatsoever about other people's problems, no matter there's an emergency state. The classical monsters like vampires, dragons, demons and the like are nothing compared with the stuff you see in this movie. Later on, as anybody can image, everybody is asking forgiveness and telling how much they actually loved each other, over and over all along the movie. I like emotions in movies for sure, but this was plain disgusting to me..specially for 3 hours! But if this is the type of scenes you like, you'll get tons of it in here! And you'll rank it 5 starts! As for me, I really thank the ones who invented the DVDs which allow speeding movies up so I don't need to put up with so much baloney as I would with the old VHS. Today we can see only what we want from a movie. Well, let's pass to the interesting parts.This movie seems to be a reply to the current anti-fear-mongering wave I've noticed lately. This wave is led by Conservative (or the like) people. The top example could be Michael Crichton's (creator of Jurassic Park, ER, Rising Sun, Sphere, etc) latest novel ""State of Fear"" and his web site where he displays a big deal of arguments and critics against all the media that keep the whole world under constant fear about everything. But this movie shows the government risking millions of people in order to avoid general panic. So, the government initially rejects the fear-mongers who predict huge catastrophes. This is interesting but it's still a movie and what I've read from Michael Crichton and others is likely to be real. At least the movie writers seem to have done some decent research. Moreover they did well in presenting all predictions and solutions in the movie as speculations. It was actually interesting hearing the scientific arguments of Dr. Hill who sees the problems and solutions. That may have been good hard science fiction.Unfortunately these interesting aspects were far from the movie's core, which was emotions and more wild emotions with lots of people caring and caring....no matter they oppose actual solutions...all the time. You'll see that some people get to be evacuated and then the president (so charmingly caring) wants to let them go back home immediately but Dr. Hill has to convince him to wait ridiculous 24 hrs to make things sure. This was too off real world as well.Regarding the special effects, some people didn't like them but I did.

At first the breaks for the non-existent commercials was somewhat annoying but I quickly got used to them. The story maintains a reasonable pace and has only a couple of spots where it seems to drag a bit.The story is set along the West Coast of the United States and involves a group of scientists who have a theory about some recent quake events. The story focuses on the work of a scientist named Dr. Samantha Hill, played by Kim Delaney, who has a theory about deep hidden fault lines and a possible catastrophic earthquake that may be coming soon.As is customary there are a number of sub-plots that play out in the lives of the main characters. All told the acting is good and so are the scenery and special effects. I enjoyed the movie all the way through and found the surround sound to be dramatic and effective. This is a movie that will probably have some appeal for those who are not particularly drawn to disaster movies as the overall impact of the movie is to show mankind in a good light.One could almost believe the movie was sponsored by FEMA because it is built up to show FEMA in a very favorable light.

What they DON'T give us, however, is a plot that stands up to any close scrutiny for more than a few minutes at the most, and usually no more than a few seconds.Kim Delaney is the maverick seismologist who insists that there are interlocking earthquake faults ready to erupt and break much of the West Coast away from the rest of the United States--a fear magnified by quakes that topple the Space Needle in Seattle, and the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.  Then there is the dreaded southeastern edge of the infamous San Andreas Fault Zone, which passes less than 80 miles from Los Angeles.  And unless drastic measures of the W.M.D. kind are tried to repair the fault line, more than Hell will break loose.Obviously the special effects work was what attracted large viewers to their TVs in May 2004 to watch this $20 million spectacular, and with good reason; the effects ARE the reason to watch it.  Beyond all that, however, a good cast which includes Fred Ward, John Schneider, and Beau Bridges, is left out to dry with lousy dialogue, melodramatic situations that wouldn't even have passed muster in any of the disaster films of the 1970s, least of all the 1974 specatcular EARTHQUAKE, and a thoroughly implausible premise.Still, for the special effects, if nothing else, I am giving this three stars.

831132,A1HWM8F07V6I8O,B0002DB5B8,Fernando H. Ramirez,"[2, 3]","There are lots of good things about this movie, but some aspects of it detracted from my enjoyment.First of all, the camera movement / cinematography tries too hard to be ""hip.""  You can almost hear the producers telling the movie-makers to ""shoot this documentary style like you're in the trenches with the people.""  As a result, the camera clumsily jerks in and out on character faces (way too close, in my opinion), it moves around too much for you to get a grasp on what's happening in many scenes.. it shakes too much in scenes when there's not a QUAKE happening.  In my opinion, this clumsy ""hip"" camera movement (pseudo-MTV style) detracts bigtime from the storytelling of this movie.  Just when I got into the movie/story, the herky-jerky camera movements constantly took me out of the experience, reminding me it was just a movie.  That is a storytelling failure.The effects work is great.  But there's not enough of it.  Why do producers always shortchange the effects work when the film clearly needs more?  Come one, man... you want to see effects when your movie is called 10.5.  Get some college kids who do effects work at home to do it for free (for experience) or something... spend some money.  For example, the destruction of San Fran was represented by the destruction of the Golden Gate Bridge and a few token buildings.  They forgot there was also a city there, and maybe 5-10 more effects shots (establishing shots) would have sufficed.  The final payoff is good, and the entire last sequence was unexpectedly great.  I thought the movie was going to end when the heroes did their thing... but it kept going interestingly.  The draining river was a chilling, nice touch.  Overall, the effects work is great.. just needs more.The acting was okay.  Beau was fantastic, but Delaney was only okay.  She seemed bored in her role.  I can almost imagine her ragging on the script after the director yelled ""cut.""  To be fair, maybe it wasn't her fault, because the ""overeager"" camerawork often jerked in and out on her face, trying to create some kind of emotion by closing in on her face from inches away.  Maybe they just kept filming to get some kind of ""real"" touch after the director yelled ""cut.""  I don't know.  I thought the Dukes of Hazzard guy was pretty good in his role.

831135,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0002DB5B8,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Living in glitzy Los Angeles has its downside, what with the landslides, the fires, the traffic, the smog, the paparazzi, the gangs, the L.A. Clippers... and, yes, the earthquakes. This mini-series 10.5 aired on NBC in 2004 and made a case for relocating to the eastern seaboard, where they only deal with hurricanes and blizzards and frostbite and such. And, really, those things aren't near as awful as the Clippers.Being neither expert nor fan of earthquakes, I can't tell you how scientifically on point this movie is (but apparently it's not very). But if you're into disaster flicks garnished with television-appropriate special effects and cheesy melodrama and personal angst - and why wouldn't you be? - then 10.5 is worth looking into, but strictly as a guilty pleasure.A train drops out of sight. A town goes missing. A series of famous landmarks gets demolished, starting with the collapse of Seattle's Space Needle in a quake registering a 7.9 on the Richter scale. This opening sequence proves to be jarring in another way, tailored as it is to an MTV/sports ad sensibility, with some bloke getting tricky on his bicycle - but, of course, you can't out-trick or outrace a force of nature. In short order we meet our cast, most of whom are actually quite relevant to the crisis at hand. There's the President of the United States, played with steadfast resolve by Beau Bridges; Fred Ward's semi-dashing character heads up FEMA; Rebecca Jenkins is the governor of California trying to put up a brave front, even as her family goes missing during the quakes. But, first and foremost, there's Dr. Samantha Hill, as played by Kim Delaney. She's the main protagonist of this thing.Dr. Hill - or ""Sam"" - is a brilliant seismologist but a control freak, and as such doesn't work well with others. She's a deep fault expert, and, despite the disbelief of her colleagues, it's her theory which ends up saving the day. Sam speculates that a series of unidentified faults is causing the chain reaction of quakes, each successive one escalating in magnitude. If you've entertained any of the more popular notions of what might happen to California should the Big One come up, well, peep this mini-series.To round off the cast, there's John Schneider as the governor's ex gone camping with his estranged teen daughter, and I guess nothing cements a father-daughter bond quicker than an impending cataclysm. The daughter, though, is very annoying with all the shrieking and the selfishness and the shrieking. And then there's the cocky surgeon (because there always has to be an arrogant schmoe in these things) and his more reserved fellow doctor, who's having his own family issues.In the ranks of disaster films, this one doesn't really come close to classics like AIRPORT ((Airport Terminal Pack (Airport/Airport '75/Airport '77/Airport '79 - The Concord)),The Towering Inferno (Special Edition), orThe Poseidon Adventure (Special Edition). It's definitely not as entertaining asVolcano,ArmageddonorThe Perfect Storm. 10.5 is middle-of-the-barrel fare. Except I'll tell you what, shopworn and clich&eacute;-ridden this movie might be, but once I tuned in, it was real hard to stop watching. It's like candy corn - you know it's not good for you, you'll feel ashamed in the morning, and you might wake up with nausea. But so what? One hallmark of disaster films is the all-star cast, something which 10.5 is lacking, with due respect to Beau Bridges, John Schneider and Fred Ward. However, I caught this mini-series when it first came out primarily because of Kim Delaney, whose Detective Diane Russell I really dug in NYPD BLUE. Dr. Samantha Hill is actually a pedestrian role, but I still think that Delaney does a fine job with what she's given. Much as she did with Det. Russell, Delaney is able to bring out the wounded vulnerability within the icy, brilliant Sam Hill. Certainly, the movie is at its most interesting whenever she's on camera.Everything you expect to see crops up sooner or later. The citywide panic. The mass evacuations. The refugee camps. The Californian coastline getting a face lift, and there's some irony there. Also the cheesy dialogue and the personal little dramas which are supposed to provide a humanizing counterpoint to the impersonal awesomeness of Mother Nature. Delaney and John Schneider are good. The other actors vary from decent to derivative. 10.5 does try to switch things up a bit by using various editing tricks, from split frames to jittery close-ups (I was half expecting Jack Bauer to show up somewhere). I will say that these techniques do lend the story a sharper sense of immediacy.For those interested and willing to sit thru 2 hours 45 minutes of talk, the 10.5 dvd does come with a director's audio commentary. Anyways, 10.5 was good for the ratings and drew in enough viewers that a made-for-television sequel10.5: Apocalypsecame out in 2006, in which Kim Delaney returns but the cheesy is even more in the hizzy. And yet 10.5: APOCALYPSE isn't the worst disaster film of all tme. That honor probably falls on a stinker like AVALANCHE, KRAKATOA - EAST OF JAVA, or JAWS THE REVENGE. SON OF THE MASK, by the way, also counts as a disaster film.",3,"""We could be looking at a seismic event larger than modern man has ever witnessed before."" - But 10.5 is no great

If you want realism, go for a (zoom zoom) walk in the real world instead of watching a disaster movie. In fact, I liked the premise of scientists trying to stop a monstrous (zoom) earthquake with nuclear bombs. Cheesy plots can work with the right talent. The character development and sub-plots were no worse than average - better than (zoom zoom zoom) most TV movies. Although the acting was fair, the characters can best be described as annoying. With a few exceptions, the earthquake scenes and destruction were generally quite good.My beef is with the sickening camera work. It is so bad (zoom) that I cannot recommend this movie to anyone (zoom) who would watch it for enjoyment. Rather, every freshman film student should watch this as an example of how NOT to use zoom (zoom zoom), jump cuts, and the shaky-cam effect. The camera is CONSTANTLY shaking and zooming in and out throughout the movie, even during the dialogue scenes where people (zoom zoom) just sit by the computer and talk. I don't know what the desired effect was, but (zoom) it did not work at all. (Zoom.) It reminded me of those YouTube videos where someone with a camcorder tries to imitate (zoom zoom zoom) ""the shaky camcorder effect"" by shaking the camcorder. (Hint: The shaky camcorder effect comes free without intentionally shaking it.) I half-expected the cameraman to start holding the camera sideways because it might look cool.As a result of the amateur direction and cinematography, 10.5 is a (zoom zoom) 0.0. Yes, it is that bad. Apparently the budget for this was $20 million. If they had another $50 for a (zoom zoom) tripod, and $0.50 for some duct tape to disable the zoom button, I think it would probably earn at least three stars. (Zoom.)

First, we have the earthquake that literally decimates Seattle and topples the Space Needle over like a big domino, then the aftershock in northern CA that forms a large chasm which in turn swallows a passenger train whole, and then the entire theory that the entire CA coastline is about to make Arizona beachfront property, so nuclear bombs are detonated across the fault line to fuse it in place. Sadly, the fissure is already breaking apart the coastline right around Los Angeles, so the entire city has to be evacuated east, and at the end of the movie, the refugee camp is literally torn in two by the coast breaking up. There doesn't seem to be a massive loss of lives in this breakup, which is always a good thing.For the past year, I have been hoping to find the movie again and Amazon saw to my needs.
