749318,AE23DYT0RDFUV,B00008YGRR,Brian Ridgway,"[3, 4]","It's hard to imagine that it's been over a decade since this terrific series began. Re-watching the first season really reminded me what a terrific beginning the series had, and although I've since become a big Jimmy Smits fan since his work on this series, I now find that there really seems to be a lot missing from NYPD Blue since the departure of David Caruso. While the show seems to maintain the visual quality and energy of the first season, it seems to settle into a predictable pattern very quickly after the departure of the JOHN KELLY character. In fact, if I was to describe what the first season of NYPD BLUE is about, I would say two things: a crisis of conscience for an Irish NY cop, and the friendship and training of a young Latin Cop ( James Martinez) and his relationship with a solid veteran detective ( John Kelly). I think the best parts of the first season are many of the moments of friendship and training between the Kelly and Martinez characters, and while there is definitely chemistry between Kelly and Andy Sipowitz, there are as many (if not more) finer moments between the weary Kelly and the up-and-coming Martinez. And it's ultimately the Kelly/Martinez hasty and emotional 'stairwell farewell' that touches the heart at the beginning of Season 2, reminding viewers what a rare treat the previous 26 episodes were. Season 2 really takes a LONG time to get moving once Kelly/Caruso departs, and it isn't until 8 episodes later, well into the introduction of the Bobby Simone character (Andy's Ride into the Country) that we start to enjoy the new combination of Simone/Sipowitz team-up. SMITS goes on to deliver some of the finest moments later in the series, but by mid season of 2, we're already seeing the convoluted stories begin, and well as the standard cop cliches start creeping in. These problems become more evident in Season 3 as well (one of the main cast is SHOT and almost dies in a by-the-numbers shootout). SOLID CAST and terrific performances remain though, but overall, a couple notches below that impossible-to-follow SEASON 1.",3,Weaker Followup To Season 1,1283385600,"09 2, 2010",2010,2080,"['hard', 'imagine', 'been', 'decade', 'terrific', 'series', 'began', 'Re-watching', 'first', 'season', 'really', 'reminded', 'what', 'terrific', 'beginning', 'series', 'had', ""'ve"", 'become', 'big', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'fan', 'work', 'series', 'now', 'find', 'really', 'be', 'lot', 'missing', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'departure', 'David', 'Caruso', 'show', 'maintain', 'visual', 'quality', 'energy', 'first', 'season', 'settle', 'predictable', 'pattern', 'very', 'quickly', 'departure', 'JOHN', 'KELLY', 'character', 'fact', 'was', 'describe', 'what', 'first', 'season', 'NYPD', 'BLUE', 'would', 'say', 'two', 'things', 'crisis', 'conscience', 'Irish', 'NY', 'cop', 'friendship', 'training', 'young', 'Latin', 'Cop', 'James', 'Martinez', 'relationship', 'solid', 'veteran', 'detective', 'John', 'Kelly', 'think', 'best', 'parts', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'friendship', 'training', 'Kelly', 'Martinez', 'characters', 'definitely', 'chemistry', 'Kelly', 'Andy', 'Sipowitz', 'are', 'many', 'not', 'more', 'finer', 'moments', 'weary', 'Kelly', 'up-and-coming', 'Martinez', 'ultimately', 'Kelly/Martinez', 'hasty', 'emotional', ""'stairwell"", 'farewell', 'heart', 'beginning', 'Season', '2', 'reminding', 'viewers', 'what', 'rare', 'treat', 'previous', '26', 'episodes', 'were', 'Season', '2', 'really', 'LONG', 'time', 'get', 'moving', 'once', 'Kelly/Caruso', 'departs', ""n't"", '8', 'episodes', 'later', 'well', 'introduction', 'Bobby', 'Simone', 'character', 'Andy', 'Ride', 'Country', 'start', 'enjoy', 'new', 'combination', 'Simone/Sipowitz', 'team-up', 'SMITS', 'deliver', 'finest', 'moments', 'later', 'series', 'mid', 'season', '2', ""'re"", 'already', 'seeing', 'convoluted', 'stories', 'begin', 'well', 'standard', 'cop', 'cliches', 'start', 'creeping', 'problems', 'become', 'more', 'evident', 'Season', '3', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'main', 'cast', 'SHOT', 'almost', 'dies', 'by-the-numbers', 'shootout', 'SOLID', 'CAST', 'terrific', 'performances', 'remain', 'overall', 'couple', 'notches', 'impossible-to-follow', 'SEASON', '1']",NYPD Blue - Season 2

So watching it now is a reveal for me. The quick editing and use of hand held cameras (though now commonplace) really drive the show forward scene to scene, and the claustrophobia of the precinct is palpable. Now that David Caruso and his posturing have exited, the acting has settled into a realistic, comfortable groove, and the characters are thrust into believable situations that challenge the mores, not just of the day, but of today as well. I was particularly impressed by the episodes involving John, the gay temp who serves as receptionist while Donna is out finding herself. Things have changed a lot from then to now, and that is all to the good, but bravery John shows, being out in a police precinct, helps to show what was and is necessary for change to happen.

749331,A5P4JIH5SJH3U,B00008YGRR,D. Ian Crutchley,"[7, 9]","Season two saw the departure of the David Caruso character, and the introduction of Bobby Simone played by Jimmy Smits. It should be remembered that Smits was the original choice to partner Denis Franz's character of Andy Sipowizc, but because of committments to LA Law was unable to do so, and David Caruso got the part. It works because Smits embues his character with warmth, compassion, but with an underlying strength. The episode where he is introduced is brilliant, and the on-going progression of the relationship between the two leads is never anything less than believable.Some reviewers express their preference for the Caruso episodes, but I have to say that for me they both work equally well. This plus the added bonus of Sipowizc's character being allowed to grow and have a personal life make series two compulsory viewing. Favourite episode? When Andy semi moves in with his new girlfriend, and she joins him in the shower, Cue one of the best lines in TV history - ""Boy, that's sure going to be clean"". Priceless!Series three please!!!P.S. Apparently when Caruso finished shooting his final scene he walked out the door of the precinct and hopped into a waiting cab to take him away.

The writing is getting more mature, being able to draw upon the growing depth of character that has been ever present since the first episode. Jimmy Smits is really settling into his role nicely. Denis Franz is becoming one of the most complex and deep characters ever crafted with a pen with his amazing and award worthy portrayal of Andy Sipowicz. All in all, I am hooked completely on this show and I think my TV watching is pretty much spoken for - at least for the next six months or so. I've got nearly 10 seasons with 22 episodes per season left.I don't know why David Caruso left so abruptly, I know I can google it but never did, but I don't feel the show lost anything. Instead, I think the show got better. I always thought Caruso's style was a bit strange. I can't put my finger on it. He stood out like a sore thumb. Maybe he seemed a bit stilted, or forced. His character was a typical red-headed Irish NYC detective. All smooth and dressed up on the outside but dangerous and unpredictable at the flip of a switch. I don't think they fully exploited what I considered to be a potential deep well of complex personality that they could have with this guy. They could have, but they didn't.All in all I am very pleased that I started watching this series.

749351,A1NF9WS7RR82MX,B00008YGRR,J. Hill,"[0, 0]","NYPD Blue had a lot of questions to answer going into the second season.  Could the show withstand the exit of David Caruso, whose star power drove Season 1's popular and critical success?  Could Dennis Franz take the lead and carry the show?  Could Jimmy Smits step in as the new partner and capture the same magic as Franz and Caruso?The answer to all those questions turned out to be an easy yes.  Franz continued his work of making Andy Sipowicz one of the most compelling characters ever on TV.  Although Caruso did the first four episodes of the season, he gives way to Smits in the fifth show.  And as a viewer, I never looked back.Smits made the character of Bobby Simone one that was always interesting to watch.  He exhibited so much emotion and heart as the new guy on the squad that no one could resist being pulled in by him.  His chemistry with Franz was easily on par with that of Caruso, and in some ways had more depth.  Simone allows Andy to become more and more human, giving Franz more chances to let his acting skills shine.Season 2 also introduces one of the show's longest-running and most liked characters, Kim Delaney's Diane Russell.  Her relationship with Bobby became a huge part of the overall storyline, and her portrayal of Russell resulted in one of the best female cop roles ever done.  While the storylines week after week were plenty enough to keep viewers interested, the stellar work of the lead actors, as well as excellent supporting characters like James Martinez, Greg Medavoy, Arthur Fancy, and Donna Abondando gave the series its place in TV history.

Like many NYPD Blue fans, I hated to see him go.  Smits stepped in immediately after and he was also very good, but the dynamics of the show would have to change.  I didn't like Bobby Simone at first, but that was probably because I was sad to see Caruso leave.  But the episodes remained gritty and intense, and Smits soon hit his stride.  All was well in the precinct again.  The downside to Season Two was the introduction of Kim Delaney to the cast near the end of the season.  I still contend that she is and was the weakest actor in the run of the series.  I'm afraid that her inclusion as a series regular is off-putting enough for me to not purchase any further season box sets that she appears in.  I'll start buying them again when Rick Schroeder's character of Danny Sorensen comes in and Delaney's role is reduced and eventually eliminated.The commentaries included in this box set are interesting though not quite fascinating, and the so-called &quot;documentary&quot; is just an episode-by-episode series of recollections by the principle cast.All in all, a good purchase.

749367,A3NI800P6Q6YNS,B00008YGRR,Matthew J. Gallagher,"[12, 22]","The first four episodes, especially Episode 1, ""Trials and Tribulations,"" which begin to detail Caruso's exit from the series - detailed in a good documentary - are excellent. Then Jimmy Smits (""LA Law,"" ""West Wing"") enters and immediately the show begins to seem like every other cop show. Caruso brought a depth and complexity to his role that Smits cannot match - and several episodes in Season Two are just awful. Everything is telegraphed. What Caruso brought was LIFE to the show - you felt this was a real cop who had a real life and who dealt with people he worked with the way most people do - with a balance of politeness, respect, and exasperation (and sometimes anger and annoyance). Dennis Franz is always good - but his scenes with Caruso were more complex. The show was better written - tougher, sexier, riskier.  I know several folks did not like Caruso as much - and Smits is probably the more charming of the two.  But Smits is not a better actor.  And he brings the show down to a level of convention that only got worse after he left and ""Saved By the Bell"" actors seemed to take over.  If you watch the last few seasons of ""Blue,"" you see a pathetic decline of a once brilliant show.  For 26 episodes, ""NYPD Blue"" was the best cop show ever.  After David Caruso left, it became just another cop show.  The proof is in these episodes. I've actually stopped watching them mid-way because they're so predictable. UPDATE NOTE: it is interesting to me, and bewildering, that some folks do not find this review helpful.  Judge for yourself before you spend a lot of money on this DVD!  Watch the first, great season, where literally EVERY episode is top drawer drama and then compare it to some of the early episodes when Smits arrives on the scene and the great tension, complexity, and earthiness of the original series starts to go out the window. Smits IS a conventional TV actor - ""LA Law,"" ""The West Wing,"" etc. What you see is what you get: decent concentration, a little passion, and mostly lightweight conviction.  Caruso, on the other hand, as one of his co-stars, Amy Brenneman, on the first season stated,  ""was doing some of the best work on TV.""  The first four episodes of this DVD set are GREAT - and then, by Smits third or fourth episode, you feel that his character basically has no flaws, is a one-dimensional (and unbelievable) hero who seems to have no real or interesting complexities in his nature. He's annoying in that he seems to have a handle on everything - and everyone. I challenge ANYONE to refute this.  The show was a masterpiece of one, shining season and then it became ""NYPD BLUE LIGHT."" And, unfortunately, it kept getting lighter, until the final, awful seasons of disgrace. Rent this first, if you can, before you spend a lot on something that is only half as good as Season One.  Although, I will say, the first four (BEST) episodes and the documentary almost make it worth the purchase.

Yes, there are other good ones too, but NYPD Blue, started it all in the nineties with it's gritty, realistic stories, compelling characters and edgy camera work.  It's nearest rival in the nineties was ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" and only ""Boomtown"" and ""The Wire"" were comparable in terms of quality over the last three or four years.  That's something!The show actually got better after the departure of David Caruso.  Bobby Simone as played by Jimmy Smits was a much more low-key portrayal in keeping with the ensemble approach  to the show and allowed the other characters to shine as well, in contrast to Season 1.Fox is changing the packaging slightly by putting the episodes on 4 two-sided discs rather than having 6 or 8 single sided discs.  I hope that these do not suffer the same problems as many of Universal's releases which also utilize two-sided discs.Support this show and buy the releases so that the Fox execs continue to release all seasons until 12.
