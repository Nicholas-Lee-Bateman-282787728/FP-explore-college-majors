1207417,A3K65JH0785O7V,B001K98M6Y,"Bryce Campbell ""just another anime fan""","[9, 9]","I just got the set two days ago and each episode was great.  Conan was shown as the tone deaf person he really is and the cases were as good as their manga counterparts, but I was disappointed by the misleading label.  In the past, FUNimation has always listed episode that were one-hour long as separate episodes and played it all the way through with no breaks, when you viewed the episode (Moonlight Sonata Murder Case, Mist Goblin, and Phantom Thief 1412, as examples of what they did in earlier releases).  However, with this set they took a two-hour long episode and literally separated it into four episodes.  It obvious that it was supposed to be 2-hours because they show scenes from the entire episode each of the four times the opening came up.  Now, this does not mean that I will not continue supporting the U.S. release of the show, but I feel cheated that they did this, when the box says ""unedited/uncut"".  I'll continue supporting the U.S. release and recommending it to others, hoping that FUNimation does not do this again in the future.",4,"Good episodes overall, but FUNimation disappointed me",1235174400,"02 21, 2009",2009,1056,"['just', 'got', 'set', 'two', 'days', 'ago', 'episode', 'was', 'great', 'Conan', 'was', 'shown', 'tone', 'deaf', 'person', 'really', 'cases', 'were', 'as', 'good', 'manga', 'counterparts', 'was', 'disappointed', 'misleading', 'label', 'past', 'FUNimation', 'always', 'listed', 'episode', 'were', 'one-hour', 'long', 'separate', 'episodes', 'played', 'way', 'breaks', 'when', 'viewed', 'episode', 'Moonlight', 'Sonata', 'Murder', 'Case', 'Mist', 'Goblin', 'Phantom', 'Thief', '1412', 'examples', 'what', 'did', 'earlier', 'releases', 'However', 'set', 'took', 'two-hour', 'long', 'episode', 'literally', 'separated', 'four', 'episodes', 'obvious', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', '2-hours', 'show', 'scenes', 'entire', 'episode', 'four', 'times', 'opening', 'came', 'up', 'Now', 'not', 'mean', 'will', 'not', 'continue', 'supporting', 'U.S.', 'release', 'show', 'feel', 'cheated', 'did', 'when', 'box', 'unedited/uncut', ""'ll"", 'continue', 'supporting', 'U.S.', 'release', 'recommending', 'others', 'hoping', 'FUNimation', 'not', 'do', 'again', 'future']",Case Closed: Season 4

Unfortunately, the English dub of Case Closed may very well be over with as Funimation is ceasing production. Spread the word of Case Closed! Buy the DVDs (possibly even as a gift), buy the manga, tell friends about it, and most importantly, stop uploading the episodes to YouTube (provided you are one who does so, if not, still refrain).  Regardless, this show deserves your attention and time -- the originality of episodes, blend of action and humor, and (surprisingly) strong soundtrack.

With the main character (Conan) being an up and coming great detective, yet forced to live in a young boy's body after he was forced to take some terrible new and experimental pill, the series becomes quite intriguing as the boy must now gather the clues and solve the crime in different ways since no one would likely believe a little kid.  Each episode is just so fun to watch as Conan somehow manages to gather all the clues, solve the crime, and bring the criminals to justice using several different methods.  It is also aways fun to try and figure out who committed the crime before Conan does.  Season 4 is just as great as the previous with many new and intriguing cases to solve.
