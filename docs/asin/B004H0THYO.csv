1407737,A3DZ2907IDX7ME,B004H0THYO,A Forest Fan,"[8, 16]","I watched one episode of this miniseries while on a trip from my hotel room, I got to see Sarah bag a caribou. Since then, I resolved to buy the DVDs when they came out.I would say the early episodes are best, you see real Alaska and real Alaskans, going about their lifestyles. And it's all about hard work, not like those city slickers from (as they call it) the 'lower 48'.For those wondering why there are no DVD extras listed, this is deceptive. The final 'episode' gives bloopers, outtakes, and reactions to filming the previous episodes. For instance, we meet the Alaska Fish and Wildlife man whose job it is to sit atop a platform on the river's mouth, counting salmon. Not exciting enough for the regular episodes, but all of this is interesting for those who have never seen Alaska.Todd Palin is a man of few words, but that's okay, he works. He has worked the BP oil shale on the northern slopes, and fished all day and night to haul in the catch that provides for his family. The Palins have a very lovely home, but it was all paid for through Todd and Sarah's hard work. (Their home was not paid for by Chicago graft, payoffs and kickbacks that would make Tony Soprano blush in shame. That would be another First Family, the one that is above media criticism, examination, or ridicule, hint hint.)Sarah's enthusiasm for her activities sounds a bit forced at times, but guess what, she's a real person, not a media figure. I enjoyed scenes like her serving Alaskans at one of her favorite diners (excellent pies made there), or just dealing with her fear of heights scaling a glacial rock.For those wondering if these episodes are pure profit for Sarah Plain, you betcha. The legal costs racked up while in office from frivolous lawsuits need to be paid off, and Sarah doesn't demand the taxpayer pay for the cost of fame. In that, she is nobler than most of her colleagues, few of whom have accomplished as much as she has.This DVD shows the best of America, and what the independent spirit of hard work can achieve.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[3, 8]","Ex-governor-of-Alaska Sarah Palin is pretty well-known to everybody in the United States, and it's hard to find anybody who doesn't have a strong opinion on her.So it shouldn't have surprised anyone that Palin and her clan have now entered the world of reality TV with ""Sarah Palin's Alaska."" It is fascination when it reveals some little-known facts about the coldest, largest state in the country, but it also feels like a giant commercial for Palin and her political career.We follow Palin, her husband, and her five kids (plus her grandson) as they go on expeditions across Alaska. They do shooting, recreational fishing, professional fishing with her soldier-turned-fisherman son Track, caribou hunting, fish camps, mountain climbing, dog-sledding, logging, RVing and camping with legendary reality-TV harridan Kate Gosselin and her kids.The most entertaining aspects of ""Sarah Palin's Alaska"" lie in the travelogue parts -- I know next to nothing about Alaska, so it's fascinating to get glimpses into the epic scenery, the remote wildness, and the way of life. While it doesn't encompass the full scope of Alaskan life (I presume there are some city-dwellers up there), it is fascinating to see how they live, such as the fishing camp where fish are caught and smoked the traditional Inuit way.What did I not like? The rest of the show. Reality TV is the bottom of the multimedia barrel, and 99% of the reality stars are not taken seriously. A politician with a reality TV show? This doesn't really translate into votes.And honestly, I often felt like I was watching an hourlong political commercial, from the inspiring country-western theme song to the photo-ops of Palin. There's a lot of emphasis on her image of a huntin'-fishin'-shootin' outdoorswoman, and we're constantly hammered with platitudes about family and togetherness. It feels like Palin is trying to convince the American people that she's the Alaskan Theodore Roosevelt.Even putting aside the political aspects of ""Sarah Palin's Alaska,"" this series fails because... it's boring. The parts that focus on the Palin family's minor troubles and activities are just DULL, since there is no conflict or any real problems beyond friendly bickering. Oh, and one of the daughters sneaking a boy into her bedroom -- that was the first and last time they did something interesting.""Sarah Palin's Alaska"" is at its most interesting when it focuses on just that -- Alaska.

I share her values, but I am not persuaded that she has the legal and political skill and prowess; she would be another W. at best.That said, this show is not about her political campaigns. It's about the human being that is Sarah Palin taking a number of exciting outdoor adventures in Alaska. Some of these adventures, such as fishing and hunting, are routine for Sarah. Some of them were clearly scheduled for the show as a new, fresh adventure that Sarah hadn't experienced much or at all before.That Sarah is a politician is not completely lost in this show; she makes a number of comments about her career as a politician, and we see her taking on television and radio interviews from time to time as well as making the rounds with the locals making political friends. And as she narrates the show (this is her show, after all), it's a no-brainer expectation that she would regularly try to use rhetoric about her adventures in Alaska as analogous to her political career. But really this stuff takes a back seat--way back seat. You come away from this show seeing Ms Palin as Wonder Woman (one of her friends on the show calls her ""Amazon Woman'), not so much ""governor"", ""vice-president"", or some other officer of the state or United States. (On the other hand, isn't that just the sort of material America needs in office? Less white collar, more blood, sweat, and tears... That's definitely the message Sarah and her followers want portrayed by this show.)And actually, the show proves less about Sarah than about her kids. Say what you will about their family (the term ""idiots"" has been used in these reviews, and I'm willing to bet that such reviewers were not so bright in their youth either), these people are real and down-to-earth, and while one would expect them to be seriously affected for better or for worse by Sarah's publicity, and they certainly aren't unaffected, they still seem, in my opinion, true to who they are. They're not idiots, they're people. One of Sarah's kids is retarded; you really feel like you're getting a transparent view of a vulnerable home, and I appreciate that glimpse.The adventures that they have are quite interesting, if indeed one finds fishing, hunting, panning for gold, kayaking, and other great Alaskan adventures to be interesting. If not, skip, there's too much of it. But the adventures definitely give a picturesque view of Alaska, and this show is amazingly gorgeous in high definition.
