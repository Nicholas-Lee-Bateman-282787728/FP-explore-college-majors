This season is especially good simply because it fresh and  new. John Ritter's antics reminds me alot of Jerry Lewis back in the day.

778437,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B0000DFZ5O,andy8047,"[4, 5]","This package contains all six episodes from the first season of ABC's hit sitcom THREE'S COMPANY. It premiered on March 15,1977 starring the late John Ritter as Jack Tripper,a young handsome aspiring chef who was then studying the culinary arts. Joyce DeWitt is Janet Wood,a brunette beauty who works in a flower shop and Suzanne Somers as blonde beauty Chrissy Snow who immediately interests Jack in many ways. Supporting cast members are the late Audra Lindley as Helen Roper and the late Norman Fell as Helen's husband Stanley. Stanley and Helen are the trio's landlords. In the first episode,Jack is asleep in the bathtub following a drinking binge from a party given by Janet and Chrissy the previous evening. The party was for Eleanor,Jack's predecessor in apartment 201. Eleanor had gotten married and given birth to a seven-pound and nine-ounce baby boy. So after Jack cooks a delicious breakfast for Janet and Chrissy,they invite him to be their new roommate. When Jack introduces himself to the Ropers,who live directly below the trio,he tells them he's moving in. But Stanley strongly denies until Janet told him Jack was gay(Stanley could never fathom a straight male platonically living with two straight women). In episode #2,Jack arrives with his belongings via taxicab from the YMCA where he previously resided,to apartment 201. He rings the bell,but instead of a chime he hears Stanley reacting to the electricity immersing in him as he was fixing the doorbell. Chrissy's mother came to L.A. for a dentist's appointment and planned to stay at the apartment. She sleeps in what would become Jack's bedroom and Jack sleeps on the couch(Jack would do that whenever there were house guests). In episode #3,it's Chrissy's birthday and the trio would celebrate amongst themselves. Stanley's young beautiful niece Karen is staying with the Ropers and Stanley pays Jack $50 to take her out despite Stanley believes Jack is gay. Jack promised the date would only last 20 minutes and he would come back home in time for the birthday celebration. Janet and Chrissy are furious with Jack. On the date,Jack who drives Stanley's car,had some trouble with it. It overheated on the freeway. He uses the $50 to reclaim the cameo Janet had hocked a while back for rent money. Jack and Karen are kissing in the Ropers' apartment and when the Ropers awake,Stanley catches Jack and Karen and immediately evicts him from apartment 201(""He was acting normal,that's sick!""). The eviction is cancelled after Karen,according to Stanley,practically attacked Jack and he showed no interest. In episode #4,Jack brings home a puppy,unaware that pets are forbidden in the apartment. Richard Kline as Larry Dallas,makes his first appearance on the show. Jack owed Larry $25 and Jack took the puppy to cancel the debt. Larry would later become Jack's best friend and the trio's upstairs neighbor. The trio parents the dog until Helen takes it in. A sleepwalking Chrissy planted the dog on the Ropers' doorstep. Helen declares the dog an anniversary present from Stanley. In episode #5,the trio redecorate the apartment and take a break to go to the neighborhood pub,the Regal Beagle,first seen in episode #2. There,at the bar are two guys and one of them takes interest in Chrissy. Chrissy feels harassed by the guy. He overhears Jack telling Janet and Chrissy that men are naturally stronger than women. He,the ""creep"",finds a ""man"" in the joint,Stanley. The ""creep"" accidentally spills Stanley's brandy and asks the bartender to give Stanley another one. Later Jack finally gets tough with the creep and for his(Jack's) so-called heroism,is given an on-the-house shot of whiskey. The creep harassed both Janet and Chrissy. In episode #6,Janet and Chrissy are out $300 in back rent money. Thinking the money was stolen,they call the police. Jack tries to get $300 from the financial aid department at his college and is denied. Janet and Chrissy don't realize until the end,that they had already paid the rent. Stanley naturally took the money,in an envelope with the word 'rent' on it, while doing a repair job. But he failed to leave a receipt indicating he received the payment(the tenant's/s' copy was still attached to his receipt book!).",5,Come and knock on their door!,1083024000,"04 27, 2004",2004,4228,"['package', 'six', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'ABC', 'hit', 'sitcom', 'THREE', 'COMPANY', 'premiered', 'March', '15,1977', 'starring', 'late', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Jack', 'Tripper', 'young', 'handsome', 'aspiring', 'chef', 'who', 'was', 'then', 'studying', 'culinary', 'arts', 'Joyce', 'DeWitt', 'Janet', 'Wood', 'brunette', 'beauty', 'who', 'flower', 'shop', 'Suzanne', 'Somers', 'blonde', 'beauty', 'Chrissy', 'Snow', 'who', 'immediately', 'interests', 'Jack', 'many', 'ways', 'Supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'late', 'Audra', 'Lindley', 'Helen', 'Roper', 'late', 'Norman', 'Fell', 'Helen', 'husband', 'Stanley', 'Stanley', 'Helen', 'are', 'trio', 'landlords', 'first', 'episode', 'Jack', 'asleep', 'bathtub', 'following', 'drinking', 'binge', 'party', 'given', 'Janet', 'Chrissy', 'previous', 'evening', 'party', 'was', 'Eleanor', 'Jack', 'predecessor', 'apartment', '201', 'Eleanor', 'had', 'gotten', 'married', 'given', 'birth', 'seven-pound', 'nine-ounce', 'baby', 'boy', 'So', 'Jack', 'delicious', 'breakfast', 'Janet', 'Chrissy', 'invite', 'be', 'new', 'roommate', 'When', 'Jack', 'Ropers', 'who', 'live', 'directly', 'trio', 'moving', 'Stanley', 'strongly', 'Janet', 'told', 'Jack', 'was', 'gay', 'Stanley', 'could', 'never', 'fathom', 'straight', 'male', 'platonically', 'living', 'two', 'straight', 'women', 'episode', '2', 'Jack', 'belongings', 'taxicab', 'YMCA', 'where', 'previously', 'resided', 'apartment', '201', 'bell', 'instead', 'chime', 'Stanley', 'reacting', 'electricity', 'immersing', 'was', 'fixing', 'doorbell', 'Chrissy', 'mother', 'came', 'L.A.', 'dentist', 'appointment', 'planned', 'stay', 'apartment', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'Jack', 'bedroom', 'Jack', 'sleeps', 'couch', 'Jack', 'would', 'do', 'whenever', 'were', 'house', 'guests', 'episode', '3', 'Chrissy', 'birthday', 'trio', 'would', 'celebrate', 'amongst', 'Stanley', 'young', 'beautiful', 'niece', 'Karen', 'staying', 'Ropers', 'Stanley', 'Jack', '50', 'take', 'out', 'Stanley', 'Jack', 'gay', 'Jack', 'promised', 'date', 'would', 'only', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'home', 'time', 'birthday', 'celebration', 'Janet', 'Chrissy', 'are', 'furious', 'Jack', 'date', 'Jack', 'who', 'Stanley', 'car', 'had', 'trouble', 'overheated', 'freeway', '50', 'reclaim', 'cameo', 'Janet', 'had', 'hocked', 'while', 'back', 'rent', 'money', 'Jack', 'Karen', 'are', 'kissing', 'Ropers', 'apartment', 'when', 'Ropers', 'awake', 'Stanley', 'Jack', 'Karen', 'immediately', 'apartment', '201', 'was', 'acting', 'normal', 'sick', 'eviction', 'cancelled', 'Karen', 'according', 'Stanley', 'practically', 'attacked', 'Jack', 'showed', 'interest', 'episode', '4', 'Jack', 'home', 'puppy', 'unaware', 'pets', 'are', 'forbidden', 'apartment', 'Richard', 'Kline', 'Larry', 'Dallas', 'first', 'appearance', 'show', 'Jack', 'owed', 'Larry', '25', 'Jack', 'took', 'puppy', 'cancel', 'debt', 'Larry', 'would', 'later', 'become', 'Jack', 'best', 'friend', 'trio', 'upstairs', 'neighbor', 'trio', 'dog', 'Helen', 'sleepwalking', 'Chrissy', 'planted', 'dog', 'Ropers', 'doorstep', 'Helen', 'dog', 'anniversary', 'present', 'Stanley', 'episode', '5', 'trio', 'redecorate', 'apartment', 'take', 'break', 'go', 'neighborhood', 'pub', 'Regal', 'Beagle', 'first', 'seen', 'episode', '2', 'bar', 'are', 'two', 'guys', 'one', 'interest', 'Chrissy', 'Chrissy', 'feels', 'harassed', 'guy', 'Jack', 'telling', 'Janet', 'Chrissy', 'men', 'are', 'naturally', 'stronger', 'women', 'creep', 'man', 'joint', 'Stanley', 'creep', 'accidentally', 'Stanley', 'brandy', 'bartender', 'give', 'Stanley', 'one', 'Later', 'Jack', 'finally', 'tough', 'creep', 'Jack', 'so-called', 'heroism', 'given', 'on-the-house', 'shot', 'whiskey', 'creep', 'harassed', 'Janet', 'Chrissy', 'episode', '6', 'Janet', 'Chrissy', 'are', '300', 'back', 'rent', 'money', 'Thinking', 'money', 'was', 'stolen', 'call', 'police', 'Jack', 'get', '300', 'financial', 'aid', 'department', 'college', 'denied', 'Janet', 'Chrissy', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'end', 'had', 'already', 'paid', 'rent', 'Stanley', 'naturally', 'took', 'money', 'envelope', 'word', ""'rent"", 'doing', 'repair', 'job', 'failed', 'leave', 'receipt', 'indicating', 'received', 'payment', ""tenant's/s"", 'copy', 'was', 'still', 'attached', 'receipt', 'book']",N/A

This is a collection of the first six episodes and lays the groundwork for the series.  The chemistry among the cast is readily apparent and John Ritter's physical comedy is genius!  Janet and Chrissy find Jack passed out in their bathtub one morning after a going away party for their roommate. They need a roommate and Jack needs a place to stay, and bing bang boom, the premise of the show is born.  But, this is the 1970's and a man living with two women is a bit scandalous.  The Ropers, the landlords of the building, won't hear of it.  So Janet tells the Ropers that Jack is gay.  Even watching this show in the 21st century, it is evident how ahead of it's time it was.

778439,A3A3M74WE0YYPS,B0000DFZ5O,anthony nasti,"[7, 7]","Readers, when you purchase this dvd, put on the pilot episode (entitled ""Man About The House""), and fast - foward to the scene were Chrissy Snow (Suzanne Somers) finds Jack Tripper (John Ritter) asleep in the bathtub, drenched in water. It is not only one of the funniest moments in tv history, but the scene that shows what a genius Ritter really was.The release of ""Three's Company"" on dvd is a bittersweet event for the show's fan. While it's great to have this piece of television history to watch anytime you'd like, it's also sad because comes just months after John Ritter's shocking and untimely death. But as a tribute to his life and career, it's great to have.And I'm not saying that Ritter was the only actor who made the people laugh. Somers and Joyce DeWitt (Janet Wood) set up most of the gags that happened on the show, and sometimes outdid Ritter. And who can forget the late Norman Fell and Audra Lindley as Mr. Roper and his sex - hungry wife Helen. Their one -liners against each other were every bit as funny as Ritter getting smashed by a door or Somers delivering one of her stupid comments. Making an early appearance is Larry, played flawlessly by the highly underrated Richard Kline. He appears briefly in ""No Children, No Dogs"".As for the episodes, the pilot is an absolute classic. ""No Children, No Dogs"" and ""It's Only Money"" are excellent as well (the former features some of the best insluts between Helen and Stanley). As for the other three, they are good too, but not worth mentioning.My only gripe about this dvd is that there are no extras. No advertisements or a making - of documentary. I do not know if Anchor Bay meant to do this right from the start or they did out of respect for John Ritter. But it doesn't matter, since the complete second season is coming out on dvd in March and is supposed to be loaded with extra. Until then, this will keep you satisfid for a long time and you'll remember that three's company, too.",5,A Great DVD That Encapsulizes One Of The Greatest Sitcoms,1075075200,"01 26, 2004",2004,1964,"['Readers', 'when', 'purchase', 'dvd', 'put', 'pilot', 'episode', 'entitled', 'Man', 'House', 'fast', 'foward', 'scene', 'were', 'Chrissy', 'Snow', 'Suzanne', 'Somers', 'Jack', 'Tripper', 'John', 'Ritter', 'asleep', 'bathtub', 'drenched', 'water', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'funniest', 'moments', 'tv', 'history', 'scene', 'what', 'genius', 'Ritter', 'really', 'was.The', 'release', 'Three', 'Company', 'dvd', 'bittersweet', 'event', 'show', 'fan', 'great', 'have', 'piece', 'television', 'history', 'watch', 'anytime', ""'d"", 'like', 'also', 'sad', 'just', 'months', 'John', 'Ritter', 'shocking', 'untimely', 'death', 'tribute', 'life', 'career', 'great', 'have.And', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Ritter', 'was', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'made', 'people', 'Somers', 'Joyce', 'DeWitt', 'Janet', 'Wood', 'set', 'up', 'most', 'gags', 'happened', 'show', 'sometimes', 'outdid', 'Ritter', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'late', 'Norman', 'Fell', 'Audra', 'Lindley', 'Mr.', 'Roper', 'sex', 'hungry', 'wife', 'Helen', 'one', '-liners', 'other', 'were', 'bit', 'as', 'funny', 'Ritter', 'getting', 'smashed', 'door', 'Somers', 'delivering', 'one', 'stupid', 'comments', 'Making', 'early', 'appearance', 'Larry', 'played', 'flawlessly', 'highly', 'underrated', 'Richard', 'Kline', 'briefly', 'No', 'Children', 'No', 'Dogs', '.As', 'episodes', 'pilot', 'absolute', 'classic', 'Children', 'No', 'Dogs', 'Only', 'Money', 'are', 'excellent', 'well', 'former', 'features', 'best', 'insluts', 'Helen', 'Stanley', 'other', 'three', 'are', 'good', 'too', 'not', 'worth', 'mentioning.My', 'only', 'gripe', 'dvd', 'are', 'extras', 'advertisements', 'making', 'documentary', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'meant', 'do', 'right', 'start', 'did', 'respect', 'John', 'Ritter', ""n't"", 'matter', 'complete', 'second', 'season', 'coming', 'out', 'dvd', 'March', 'supposed', 'be', 'loaded', 'extra', 'then', 'will', 'keep', 'satisfid', 'long', 'time', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'three', 'company', 'too']",N/A
778440,A1Q02WFA087CTF,B0000DFZ5O,"Anthony Nasti ""Music Maniac""","[3, 4]","The 1970s' marked the rise of the sitcom. There were early signs of this in the 1960s' with shows like ""The Nelsons"" and ""The Donna Reed Show"". Shows like ""All In The Family"" were among the first hit sitcoms, But the sitcoom boom didn't really take off untila round 1974, when ""Happy Days"" and ""Good Times"" hit the air. These shows opened the door for a long line of sitcom hits - ""The Jeffersons"", ""The Facts Of Life"", ""Barney Miller"" and many others to name a few. Thrown into this barrage of sitcoms was ""Three's Company"". It turned out to be tv gold, garnering huge ratings and making star out of Joyce DeWitt, Suzanne Somers and, of course, the late John Ritter.""Three's Company"" was first aired in 1977. Shows like the ones I just mentioned were in their peak period. But ""Three's Company"" was different from most. Its plotline was more risque:a man living in an apartment pretending to be gay in order to live with 3 lovely women, much to the dismay of the sexually problmeatic landlords, The Ropers (Norman Fell and Audra Lindley). But the show worked. For starters, the acting was great. The three stars had a full understanding of their charcters' characteristics. Plus, the show as well - written with many great oneliners.The release of this dvd was bittersweet, coming out about 11 weeks after the shocking and untimely death of John Ritter from heart failure. And anyon who thinks this was a way to cash in on Ritter's death is wrong because his dvd was scheduled for release long before his passing.The episodes here are hilarious. The first episode is the pilot, ""Man About The House"". This one gives a very good introduction to the characters; Chrissy, the sexy and stupid blonde who attracts all different kinds of men, Janet the plain but pretty girl who would kill to get a good man, and of course Jack, the bumbling skirtchaser who pretends he's gay to live with the two girl. Actually, at first he just wants to make it with Chrissy, but as the series goes on he grows to love Janet just as much.The other episodes are all good except for the one entitled ""Roper's Niece"". I just didn't like this one. But my favorites were ""No Children, No Dogs"" (featuring the first appearance of richard Kline's Larry) and ""It's Only Money"".Overall, a great dvd. With season 2 just released, I cn't wait for seasons and 4. However, seasons 5 - 8 I can wait for. During these years, Suzanne Somers was fired from the show and replaced with the flacid Terry played Priscilla Barnes. Jack started to become less attracted to the girls in the aprtment and focused more on his job. Pity it had to end that way. If they had kept Chrissy til the end, it could've lasted longer.",5,A Great DVD Caputring One Of The Greatest Sitcoms Ever,1089936000,"07 16, 2004",2004,2678,"['1970s', 'marked', 'rise', 'sitcom', 'were', 'early', 'signs', '1960s', 'shows', 'Nelsons', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Show', 'Family', 'were', 'first', 'hit', 'sitcoms', 'sitcoom', 'boom', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'take', 'off', 'untila', 'round', '1974', 'when', 'Happy', 'Days', 'Good', 'Times', 'hit', 'air', 'shows', 'opened', 'door', 'long', 'line', 'sitcom', 'Jeffersons', 'Facts', 'Life', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'many', 'others', 'name', 'few', 'Thrown', 'barrage', 'sitcoms', 'was', 'Three', 'Company', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'tv', 'gold', 'garnering', 'huge', 'ratings', 'making', 'star', 'Joyce', 'DeWitt', 'Suzanne', 'Somers', 'course', 'late', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Three', 'Company', 'was', 'first', 'aired', '1977', 'Shows', 'ones', 'just', 'mentioned', 'were', 'peak', 'period', 'Three', 'Company', 'was', 'different', 'most', 'plotline', 'was', 'more', 'risque', 'man', 'living', 'apartment', 'pretending', 'be', 'gay', 'order', 'live', '3', 'lovely', 'women', 'much', 'dismay', 'sexually', 'problmeatic', 'landlords', 'Ropers', 'Norman', 'Fell', 'Audra', 'Lindley', 'show', 'worked', 'starters', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'three', 'stars', 'had', 'full', 'understanding', 'charcters', 'characteristics', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'written', 'many', 'great', 'oneliners.The', 'release', 'dvd', 'was', 'bittersweet', 'coming', 'out', 'about', '11', 'weeks', 'shocking', 'untimely', 'death', 'John', 'Ritter', 'heart', 'failure', 'anyon', 'who', 'was', 'way', 'cash', 'Ritter', 'death', 'wrong', 'dvd', 'was', 'scheduled', 'release', 'long', 'passing.The', 'episodes', 'here', 'are', 'hilarious', 'first', 'episode', 'pilot', 'Man', 'House', 'one', 'very', 'good', 'introduction', 'characters', 'Chrissy', 'sexy', 'stupid', 'blonde', 'who', 'different', 'kinds', 'men', 'Janet', 'plain', 'pretty', 'girl', 'who', 'would', 'kill', 'get', 'good', 'man', 'course', 'Jack', 'bumbling', 'skirtchaser', 'who', 'gay', 'live', 'two', 'girl', 'Actually', 'first', 'just', 'make', 'Chrissy', 'series', 'love', 'Janet', 'just', 'much.The', 'other', 'episodes', 'are', 'good', 'one', 'entitled', 'Roper', 'Niece', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'one', 'favorites', 'were', 'No', 'Children', 'No', 'Dogs', 'featuring', 'first', 'appearance', 'richard', 'Kline', 'Larry', 'Only', 'Money', '.Overall', 'great', 'dvd', 'season', '2', 'just', 'released', 'c', ""n't"", 'wait', 'seasons', '4', 'However', 'seasons', '5', '8', 'can', 'wait', 'years', 'Suzanne', 'Somers', 'was', 'fired', 'show', 'replaced', 'flacid', 'Terry', 'played', 'Priscilla', 'Barnes', 'Jack', 'started', 'become', 'less', 'attracted', 'girls', 'aprtment', 'focused', 'more', 'job', 'Pity', 'had', 'end', 'way', 'had', 'kept', 'Chrissy', 'end', 'could', ""'ve"", 'lasted', 'longer']",N/A

The first season of Three's Company has arrived and I'm here to tell you about it.Well, it is only six episodes -- but all on one disc.  Reason being is that Three's Company was a mid-season replacement so there's only six to begin with.Not much on the extras, but a nice bonus.  From the menu, you get to pick which one you want to watch and when you select it, it has a quick written overview of each episode.  Unusual and nice for a DVD TV series.  Bad part is, once you watch an episode, you can't hit the forward button to pass up the credits or go to the next scene -- it automatically ends the episode taking you back to the main menu.Otherwise, you'll be happy to know that a percentage of the cost of the first season DVD will go to John Ritter's favorite charity for cerebral palsy (something his older brother suffered from) and that the next season will have more of a tribute to John.

Finally, the first 6 episodes of this landmark sitcom that aired between March & April 1977 are preserved on digital.  Each episode is a classic in its own right and memorable if you know the show.  Three's Company, more than anything John Ritter did, best displayed his talent for comedy, especially physical.  Ritter had the ability to turn the lamest storyline into a laughfest.  This also is easily his best and most popular work, other sitcoms such as ""Hearts Afire"" and ""8 Simple Rules"" hold no comparison and its obvious that the only reason those shows made it was because of Ritter's involvment.  The same can be said about Three's Company to some extent, not to exclude the contributions of Joyce Dewitt & Suzanne Somers.  Some are of the mindset that Chrissy was the show (maybe she just thought that), but I've always thought it was about Jack.  He should've been paid more, not because he's a man, but because if he left the show, it would've ended.  8 simple rules doesn't have long believe me.  Three's Company was special because all of the characters were important to the show and they each were hilarious in their own right:  The Ropers (Norman Fell & Audra Lindley, Larry (Richard Kline), Mr. Furley (Don Knotts), Cindy (Jenilee Harrison), and Terri (Priscilla Barnes).  The first season is so important:  Its where Janet & Chrissy find Jack sleeping in their bathtub and its where we meet the Ropers and Jack tells them he's gay!  And that's just the first episode!  Here's the classic episodes you get:01. A Man about the house02. And Mother makes four03. Roper's niece04. No children, no dogs05. Jack the giant killer06. It's only moneyAnchor Bay has done a great job with presenting the first season and has included a featurette on John Ritter.  Yes it would've been great to have more features, but having the first 6 episodes that started it all is treasure enough!  I hope they intend to release all 7 following seasons.  Even though there were cast changes through out, Three's Company found a way to keep the laughter going.  God Bless John Ritter for giving us so much laughter.  Thanks to Anchor Bay for releasing this on DVD so we can relive it again and again!  What a great show to own!

Sporting a plethora of quirky characters and fresh writing talent that explored modern day issues, the show held its own as one of the funniest programs on TV. Picking up where All In The Family left off, Three's Company delved into the social taboos of its day, dealing with subjects such as homosexuality, racism, sexual harassment, and of course, unmarried men and women living together... But the true success of Three's Company stemmed from the comic talents of John Ritter and Suzanne Somers who became instant stars as a result of their respective roles on the show...In Three's Company, John Ritter plays the role of Jack Tripper, a young cooking student in San Diego who wants to move into an apartment with his two female friends - the far more mature Janet Wood (Joyce DeWitt) and the blonde and ditsy Chrissy Snow (Suzanne Somers). But the three friends face the possible wrath of landlord Stanley Roper (Norman Fell), an old-fashioned guy who would never allow such an arrangement. With the aid of Roper's wife Helen (Audra Lindley), the three manage to convince Stanley that Jack is gay (when he is, in fact, a notorious ladies man). Jack's friend Larry (Richard Kline) also fashions himself a player on the local singles scene, and he makes regular appearances on the show. Following Season 3, Stanley and Helen left the show in pursuit of their own spin-off titled The Ropers. Don Knotts (of Andy Griffith Show fame) was brought in to play the new landlord, Mr. Furley - a nave, loud-mouthed ditz who tripled the hilarity of every scene in which he appeared...The Three's Company (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""A Man About the House"" in which roommates Janet Wood and Chrissy Snow throw a going away party for their roommate Eleanor. In search of another roommate to lower the rent burden, the two run across Jack Tripper passed out in their bathtub. At first, the two women are apprehensive about Jack becoming their third roommate, but since they can't cook and he's in cooking school, they agree. The only problem is convincing their old-fashioned landlord Stanley Roper to allow a man to live with two women. They convince him by telling Stanley that Jack is gay... Other notable episodes from the shortened Season 1 include ""And Mother Makes Four"" in which Chrissy attempts to conceal from her mother that a man is one of her roommates, and ""Roper's Niece"" in which Mr. Roper sets Jack up with his promiscuous niece in order to see if Jack is really gay...Below is a list of episodes included on the Three's Company (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (A Man About the House)Episode 2 (And Mother Makes Four)Episode 3 (Roper's Niece)Episode 4 (No Children, No Pets)Episode 5 (Jack the Giant Killer)Episode 6 (It's Only Money)The DVD Report",5,Come and knock on their door...,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,2961,"['Bursting', 'television', 'landscape', 'Spring', '1977', 'Three', 'Company', 'quickly', 'skyrocketed', 'ratings', 'cracking', 'top', '8', 'season', 'last', 'Sporting', 'plethora', 'quirky', 'characters', 'fresh', 'writing', 'talent', 'explored', 'modern', 'day', 'issues', 'show', 'held', 'own', 'one', 'funniest', 'programs', 'TV', 'Picking', 'up', 'where', 'Family', 'left', 'off', 'Three', 'Company', 'delved', 'social', 'taboos', 'day', 'dealing', 'subjects', 'such', 'homosexuality', 'racism', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'course', 'unmarried', 'men', 'women', 'living', 'together', 'true', 'success', 'Three', 'Company', 'stemmed', 'comic', 'talents', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Suzanne', 'Somers', 'who', 'became', 'instant', 'stars', 'result', 'respective', 'roles', 'show', 'Three', 'Company', 'John', 'Ritter', 'role', 'Jack', 'Tripper', 'young', 'cooking', 'student', 'San', 'Diego', 'who', 'move', 'apartment', 'two', 'female', 'friends', 'far', 'more', 'mature', 'Janet', 'Wood', 'Joyce', 'DeWitt', 'blonde', 'ditsy', 'Chrissy', 'Snow', 'Suzanne', 'Somers', 'three', 'friends', 'face', 'possible', 'wrath', 'landlord', 'Stanley', 'Roper', 'Norman', 'Fell', 'old-fashioned', 'guy', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'allow', 'such', 'arrangement', 'aid', 'Roper', 'wife', 'Helen', 'Audra', 'Lindley', 'three', 'manage', 'convince', 'Stanley', 'Jack', 'gay', 'when', 'fact', 'notorious', 'ladies', 'man', 'Jack', 'friend', 'Larry', 'Richard', 'Kline', 'also', 'player', 'local', 'singles', 'scene', 'regular', 'appearances', 'show', 'Following', 'Season', '3', 'Stanley', 'Helen', 'left', 'show', 'pursuit', 'own', 'spin-off', 'titled', 'Ropers', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', 'fame', 'was', 'brought', 'play', 'new', 'landlord', 'Mr.', 'Furley', 'nave', 'loud-mouthed', 'ditz', 'who', 'tripled', 'hilarity', 'scene', 'appeared', 'Three', 'Company', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'A', 'Man', 'House', 'Janet', 'Wood', 'Chrissy', 'Snow', 'throw', 'going', 'away', 'party', 'roommate', 'Eleanor', 'search', 'roommate', 'lower', 'rent', 'burden', 'two', 'run', 'Jack', 'Tripper', 'passed', 'out', 'bathtub', 'first', 'two', 'women', 'are', 'apprehensive', 'Jack', 'becoming', 'third', 'roommate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cook', 'cooking', 'school', 'agree', 'only', 'problem', 'convincing', 'old-fashioned', 'landlord', 'Stanley', 'Roper', 'allow', 'man', 'live', 'two', 'women', 'convince', 'telling', 'Stanley', 'Jack', 'gay', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'shortened', 'Season', '1', 'include', 'Mother', 'Makes', 'Four', 'Chrissy', 'attempts', 'conceal', 'mother', 'man', 'one', 'roommates', 'Roper', 'Niece', 'Mr.', 'Roper', 'Jack', 'up', 'promiscuous', 'niece', 'order', 'see', 'Jack', 'really', 'gay', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Three', 'Company', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'Episode', '1', 'Man', 'House', 'Episode', '2', 'Mother', 'Makes', 'Four', 'Episode', '3', 'Roper', 'Niece', 'Episode', '4', 'Children', 'No', 'Pets', 'Episode', '5', 'Jack', 'Giant', 'Killer', 'Episode', '6', 'Only', 'Money', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

I saw it in its syndicated glory, years later, as a little kid.  Though, some of the innuendo went clear over my head, I just knew it was hilarious.  John Ritter (as Jack Tripper) was introduced to us, on this program, as a fantastic physical comedien.  This man looked like he was made of rubber!  The way he ran around with boundless energy and made wonderful use of the broad and bawdy humor to his advantage.  What's more, his supporting cast was absolutely terrific here.  This co-stars Joyce Dewitt and Suzanne Sommers.I won't go into detail about plot here, but I will say that the stories are centered around the lives of three roommates--two women and a man.

Many good and bad shows have come and gone, but Three's Company remains a familiar sitcom providing laughs and good memories. With the passing of John Ritter still on most fans mind it is extra special to watch the earlier episodes especially. He was a brilliant physical comedian/actor and dramatically underrated too. Gone too are both Audra Lindley and Norman Fell who were so good they branched off and had their own series. They live on in these episodes and in our hearts.One thing interesting about the first season is how different (looking and acting) each character is. Jack and Chrissy are both very into each other, but follow the rules and keep things relatively clean. Speaking of Chrissy, she is more reserved and not the complete ""ditz"" she transforms into in later seasons. Janet too is less bossy and protective. I think only Jack stays pretty much constant through the years.This collection features the following episodes:A Man About the House - The pilot featuring the ""girls"" meeting Jack (sleeping in the tub) for the first time as well as an introduction to the Ropers. Jack's ""lifestyle"" is established much to his objection.And Mother Makes Four - Chrissy's Mother decides to pop in and then later spend the night, thus creating a frantic/hilarious scenario for the ""kids"". Jack's famous human lampshade impersonation is displayed which still is a riot.Roper's Niece - Jack and the girls have planned a little party for Janet's birthday. Roper's niece is in town and needs a night out to be away from the elder Ropers. Stanley Roper thinks Jack is a safe date, but Jack is disinterested. He quickly changes plans and goes out her upon seeing her. The ending especially is very heart warming.No Children, No Pets - Larry Dallas is introduced and offers a cute puppy to the kids. The only problem is the ""No Pets, No Children"" policy the Ropers strictly enforce. The first of many ""miscommunications"" occurs Janet thinks the worst, eaves dropping on Jack and Chrissy.Jack the Giant Killer - A bully hits on the girls at the Regal Beagle right in front of Jack. Jack is embarrassed as he does not stand up for himself. A very funny episode many guys can relate to.It's Only Money - The rent money is missing and the kids assume they have been robbed. In their frenzy, they avoid the Ropers at any cost as they look for time and money.Six episodes that lay the foundation to one of the great sitcoms of TV History in one DVD!

First of all, every single episode is about the same. How many episodes can be written on a simple misunderstanding? John Ritter was talented, but this show caused him to be castwritten for the rest of his life. The guy acted gay just a little 'too' well if you ask me. The best you can say about this show is that Suzanne Somers used to jump around and jiggle without a bra.Don't be fooled by the cover. Joyce DeWitt did not look this hot until much later in the show. For now she still has the dippy-doo haircut and has the sex appeal of a cactus. The producers of the show didn't make her sexy until Suzanne left.""Larry"" the used car salesman upstairs may have played a ladie's man, but he was just plain scary, like a werewolf. When was that hairstyle ever popular? His eyebrows seemed to reach out and grab people. The guy was as hairy as a rug too. Just looking at his arms you couldn't tell what race he was.Well, John died recently while making a show with the sexiest woman on television, Katey Sagal. People are saying this DVD release is a tribute to John. Poo poo I say. If Three's Company needed a much needed tribute it was to the great Norman Fell, aka Mr. Roper. He was funnier than four John Ritters. I mean c'mon he had lines like ""Hey it's easy to find my wife on a nude beach, she's the one that looks like her socks are rolled down!""

It not only makes you laugh but the intelligent wit, sarcasm and charm threw into each episode gives it a kick, some jokes and one liners are so good that I can't believe I it took me so long to finally watch this. Of course I didn't discover it myself, my boyfriend made me watch it - I saw the entire 1st season in one sitting, and that's coming from a girl who doesn't like to watch TV! I couldn't get enough and simply had to see the whole thing.The premise sounds simple enough; two female roommates, Janet and Chrissy who have a third roommate, Jack - pretending that he's gay in order not to get evicted by the landlords Mr and Mrs. Roper. They are trying to balance their new friendship and the snooping landlords, visiting parents and not get caught while going through challenges of life and work in a funny, lighthearted manner. The stress in this show is comedic, not draining to the viewer.I think there's something cozy and cute about 70's d&eacute;cor and even the semi hideous clothing that I find fascinating. My favorite character is the landlady, her sarcasm is priceless and her smug remarks jabbing at her husband and lack of passion in the bedroom are sharp but unquestionably hilarious. Her eye rolling and faces are priceless too, her character ads a level of delightful mischief to the show. The first season is just six episodes but I all ready have the rest and can't wait to sink into it. The real fun part is that each episode has a theme and things always go crazy and get out of hand for the roommates. Not getting caught or figuring out the problem is always a fun resolution at the end of each show.Fun and easy to watch, perfect for the weekend when you can sit down, grab a snack and try not to fall of the couch from laughing.- Kasia S.",5,Classic TV with a kick,1210377600,"05 10, 2008",2008,1885,"['Three', 'Company', 'jewel', 'rough', 'who', 'knew', '70', 'sitcom', 'can', 'beat', 'out', 'most', 'what', 'TV', 'today', 'not', 'only', 'intelligent', 'wit', 'sarcasm', 'charm', 'threw', 'episode', 'kick', 'jokes', 'one', 'liners', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'finally', 'watch', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'discover', 'boyfriend', 'made', 'watch', 'saw', 'entire', '1st', 'season', 'one', 'sitting', 'coming', 'girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'watch', 'TV', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'simply', 'had', 'see', 'whole', 'thing.The', 'premise', 'simple', 'enough', 'two', 'female', 'roommates', 'Janet', 'Chrissy', 'who', 'have', 'third', 'roommate', 'Jack', 'pretending', 'gay', 'order', 'not', 'get', 'evicted', 'landlords', 'Mr', 'Mrs.', 'Roper', 'are', 'trying', 'balance', 'new', 'friendship', 'snooping', 'landlords', 'visiting', 'parents', 'not', 'get', 'caught', 'going', 'challenges', 'life', 'work', 'funny', 'lighthearted', 'manner', 'stress', 'show', 'comedic', 'not', 'draining', 'viewer.I', 'think', 'something', 'cozy', 'cute', '70', 'd', 'eacute', 'cor', 'even', 'semi', 'hideous', 'clothing', 'find', 'fascinating', 'favorite', 'character', 'landlady', 'sarcasm', 'priceless', 'smug', 'remarks', 'jabbing', 'husband', 'lack', 'passion', 'bedroom', 'are', 'sharp', 'unquestionably', 'hilarious', 'eye', 'rolling', 'are', 'priceless', 'too', 'character', 'ads', 'level', 'delightful', 'mischief', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'just', 'six', 'episodes', 'all', 'ready', 'have', 'rest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'sink', 'real', 'fun', 'part', 'episode', 'theme', 'things', 'always', 'go', 'crazy', 'get', 'hand', 'roommates', 'Not', 'getting', 'caught', 'figuring', 'out', 'problem', 'always', 'fun', 'resolution', 'end', 'show.Fun', 'easy', 'watch', 'perfect', 'weekend', 'when', 'can', 'sit', 'down', 'grab', 'snack', 'try', 'not', 'fall', 'couch', 'laughing.-', 'Kasia', 'S']",N/A

When I did some research I realized it was a starter or a test season. I love all the episodes on this set: A Man About The House (The pilot episode), And Mother Makes Four, Roper's Niece, No Children, No Dogs, Jack The Giant Killer, & It's Only Money.

Originally a mid-season replacement, Three's Company became such a bona fide (and can you believe?) controversial show that ABC ordered up a full second season.  The premise of the show is simple: Chrissy and Janet need a third roommate tp help with the bills when they meet Jack Tripper.  The only problem?  The landlord, Mr. Roper, won't allow a man to live with two women.  The solution?  Tell him Jack pitches for the other team.

778521,AMWL7XIWIPXEZ,B0000DFZ5O,Twiddles42,"[25, 32]","I was reluctant to buy this disc because of its high price/few episodes ratio.  (Come on, &quot;All in the Family&quot; gets 26 episodes for $30, that's under $1 per episode and that's how it should be for all TV!)  However, as a proceed of the purchase (how much they won't tell us, hmmmm...) goes to a charity John Ritter adored, I broke down tonight and bought it.After the ubiquitous FBI screen disappears, I was greeted with a menu.  Ignore the naysayers, there is nothing wrong with how this menu works and I've used far, far worse in my 300 movie collection.  I rather like the menu...  And the fact they have a menu option telling us of the Spring 2004 release for season 2 made my day, it's nice to see they'll put out this series for the fans.Now for the transfer.  Audio quality is superb, well restored.  Video quality is a different story.  Upon freeze-framing, it's very clear that, despite doing a good job at restoring the master tapes, they did a rather poor transfering the video to DVD.  (You HDTV fans out there may not like watching this on your sets...  and by 1996, the FCC is pulling the plug on current broadcast standards...)  I can think of 2 reasons why the video looks as poor as it does, but it suffices to say that the end result is a video image that looks needlessly grainy; broadcast video technology of the time never ever looked this bad.  But while not as bad as VHS consumer quality videotape, it is well below acceptable DVD quality.  (for another example of what not to do in terms of transfrring video quality onto DVD, check out the dithering used in &quot;The Best of the Chris Rock Show&quot; - yuck!)  But given the price of this disc and that &quot;All in the Family&quot; costs less per episode and yet looks far better (despite NOT having had its master tapes restored), I'm knocking 2 points off.  DVD video should not ever look this grainy in a freeze-frame.  (it is bearable when things in motion, but be prepared for a shock if you're a &quot;quality freak&quot;.)6 episodes.  I was pondering the same issue, why not have a season 1 + 2 box set?  But then we'd have to wait until spring, and I hate waiting, though I would have if the video looked better.  Besides, these episodes are HILARIOUS.  The gags, the double entendres, the Ropers...  it's all there.  And when you are laughing so much you start to cry and get a stomachache, you know you're watching a winner of a show that's well written and well cast.  No wonder &quot;Three's Company&quot; became a success so quickly.  As other reviewers here and other websites post plot synopses and reviews, I won't here.  (well, &quot;No Dogs, No Children&quot; was probably my favorite of the bunch, especially the scene where Chrissy and Jack are in the kitchen feeding the puppy...)And the real downfall is, John Ritter died an untimely death.  :-(  He will be missed.
