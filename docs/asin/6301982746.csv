288915,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6301982746,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","Rocky V, 1990 filmThis begins in Moscow, Rocky fights a Soviet boxer. [The continuation from the last movie.] &#8220;No holds barred?&#8221; Rocky wins again. [Was ths a surprise?] Adrienne talks to him. Rocky just wants to go home. His son greets him. Rumors about complications? &#8220;Doctors say boxing should be banned.&#8221; Rocky agrees, doctors should stay out of the ring! Will Rocky retire? Has he changed? &#8220;Rocky Racoon?&#8221; What about that &#8220;Power of Attorney&#8221; given to his accountant? All the money is gone! [Bad investments?] Who is to blame? The doctors diagnose irreversible brain damage. He can&#8217;t be licensed in any state. [Note the two warnings in these scenes.] Rocky&#8217;s estate is auctioned off, what will it net? Rocky visits &#8220;Mighty Mick&#8217;s&#8221; gymnasium and remembers the past. Rocky moves back to his old neighborhood. &#8220;Welcome back!&#8221; G. W. Duke calls Adrienne about a chance; he is refused. His son goes to school. A promoter talks about another fight. &#8220;He&#8217;s done fighting!&#8221;Rocky&#8217;s son Robert has trouble in school. Does the new boxer use a head gear? Is he too aggressive? Tommy Gunn wants another chance. Rocky&#8217;s son wants to learn how to box to defend himself. [A lesson here, even when two against one.] You have to learn how to control fear, says Rocky. Robert is robbed again. [Note the barbed wire on top of that brick wall, like in East Berlin.] Rocky manages Tommy, his advice works. Tommy advances, Robert practices and applies his knowledge in the real world. Tommy keeps on winning. He fights in Las Vegas and wins. That promoter talks to Tommy about a new deal. Robert is growing up. Or is it jealousy? G. W. Duke brings Tommy home, then he leaves. &#8220;Watching the parade go by?&#8221;Tommy will sign a contract to get a title shot. Rocky is disappointed. Is he losing his family? When did Robert start smoking? Tommy gets his promised fight in Las Vegas and wins. An upset victory? Gunn thanks Duke, not Rocky. Who is disappointed? Reporters criticize this fight. Are they justified? Or is this just a way to sell newspapers? Duke advises Tommy to challenge Rocky for another fight. [Will this sell a lot of tickets and exploit these boxers?] Gunn challenges Rocky to a fight in public. [Note the presence of the camera.] Rocky still has what it takes. But Gunn isn&#8217;t through yet. &#8220;One more round.&#8221; It goes on until one man can&#8217;t stand. &#8220;Sue me for what?&#8221; The crowd cheers Rocky and Robert run up the stairs to that Philadelphia museum. [Is this the end of the series?]The original &#8220;Rocky&#8221; was like a morality play for America battered by the Ford recession. This movie is like the retrospection of a man past middle age; he realized he reached a plateau. His best is in the past. This is a good story that tells about the fight business. Are young boxers built up to encourage fans and bettors only to soon burn out? They say there are no fixed fights anymore. Is that because boxing is dying out (like many movie theaters or minor league sports)?",4,The End of the Road?,1401753600,"06 3, 2014",2014,3126,"['Rocky', 'V', '1990', 'filmThis', 'Moscow', 'Rocky', 'Soviet', 'boxer', '[', 'continuation', 'last', 'movie', ']', '8220', 'No', 'barred', '8221', 'Rocky', 'again', '[', 'Was', 'surprise', ']', 'Adrienne', 'talks', 'Rocky', 'just', 'go', 'home', 'son', 'Rumors', 'complications', '8220', 'Doctors', 'say', 'boxing', 'should', 'be', 'banned.', '8221', 'Rocky', 'doctors', 'should', 'stay', 'ring', 'Will', 'Rocky', 'retire', 'changed', '8220', 'Rocky', 'Racoon', '8221', 'What', '8220', 'Power', 'Attorney', '8221', 'given', 'accountant', 'money', 'gone', '[', 'Bad', 'investments', ']', 'Who', 'blame', 'doctors', 'diagnose', 'irreversible', 'brain', 'damage', 'can', '8217', 'be', 'licensed', 'state', '[', 'Note', 'two', 'warnings', 'scenes', ']', 'Rocky', '8217', 's', 'estate', 'auctioned', 'off', 'what', 'will', 'net', 'Rocky', '8220', 'Mighty', 'Mick', '8217', '8221', 'gymnasium', 'past', 'Rocky', 'back', 'old', 'neighborhood', '8220', 'Welcome', 'back', '8221', 'G.', 'W.', 'Duke', 'Adrienne', 'chance', 'refused', 'son', 'school', 'promoter', 'talks', 'fight', '8220', '8217', 'done', 'fighting', '8221', 'Rocky', '8217', 'son', 'Robert', 'trouble', 'school', 'new', 'boxer', 'use', 'head', 'gear', 'too', 'aggressive', 'Tommy', 'Gunn', 'chance', 'Rocky', '8217', 'son', 'learn', 'how', 'box', 'defend', '[', 'lesson', 'here', 'even', 'when', 'two', 'one', ']', 'have', 'learn', 'how', 'control', 'fear', 'Rocky', 'Robert', 'robbed', 'again', '[', 'Note', 'barbed', 'wire', 'top', 'brick', 'wall', 'East', 'Berlin', 'Rocky', 'manages', 'Tommy', 'advice', 'works', 'Tommy', 'advances', 'Robert', 'practices', 'knowledge', 'real', 'world', 'Tommy', 'winning', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'wins', 'promoter', 'talks', 'Tommy', 'new', 'deal', 'Robert', 'growing', 'up', 'jealousy', 'G.', 'W.', 'Duke', 'Tommy', 'home', 'then', '8220', 'Watching', 'parade', 'go', '8221', 'Tommy', 'will', 'sign', 'contract', 'get', 'title', 'shot', 'Rocky', 'disappointed', 'losing', 'family', 'When', 'did', 'Robert', 'start', 'smoking', 'Tommy', 'promised', 'fight', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'wins', 'upset', 'victory', 'Gunn', 'thanks', 'Duke', 'not', 'Rocky', 'Who', 'disappointed', 'Reporters', 'criticize', 'fight', 'Are', 'justified', 'just', 'way', 'sell', 'newspapers', 'Duke', 'Tommy', 'challenge', 'Rocky', 'fight', '[', 'Will', 'sell', 'lot', 'tickets', 'exploit', 'boxers', ']', 'Gunn', 'Rocky', 'fight', 'public', '[', 'Note', 'presence', 'camera', ']', 'Rocky', 'still', 'what', 'Gunn', 'isn', '8217', 'yet', '8220', 'One', 'more', 'round.', '8221', 'one', 'man', 'can', '8217', 't', 'stand', '8220', 'Sue', 'what', '8221', 'crowd', 'cheers', 'Rocky', 'Robert', 'run', 'up', 'stairs', 'Philadelphia', 'museum', '[', 'end', 'series', 'original', '8220', 'Rocky', '8221', 'was', 'morality', 'play', 'America', 'battered', 'Ford', 'recession', 'movie', 'retrospection', 'man', 'middle', 'age', 'realized', 'reached', 'plateau', 'best', 'past', 'good', 'story', 'fight', 'business', 'Are', 'young', 'boxers', 'built', 'up', 'encourage', 'fans', 'bettors', 'only', 'soon', 'burn', 'out', 'say', 'are', 'fixed', 'fights', 'anymore', 'boxing', 'dying', 'out', 'many', 'movie', 'theaters', 'minor', 'league', 'sports']",Rocky 5 VHS

288922,AICC1R30KLRU8,6301982746,Anthony Trimarchi,"[0, 1]","The concept of ""Rocky V"" is the real life tale of many celebrities and athletes. This movie has fared bad reviews, and critics look at it negative since it departed from the Rocky III/IV storylines of ""war in the ring"", but it's a reality type of film. How many times do we see a sports athlete or movie stars go from rags to riches than rags again? We see it often especially in American Football. This film displayed the honesty of this reality. Instead of Rocky riding off into the sunset as a super rich near-action figure boxing hero, Rocky finds that bad decisions and management, his now inability to participate in his sport, and his lack of education outside of his sport has put him (now broke) back onto the same streets he came from with only the South Philadelphia house his brother-in-law kept from their street living days. We also see Rocky return to his roots where his ""true"" friends welcome him home and don't abandoned him now the money is gone. Rocky III and IV went more action hero (ie Rocky taking on an Uber-Drago in Rocky IV), and Rocky V brought it back into the reality of where Rocky I and II left off. Tommy Gunn the up and comer whom Rocky takes under his wing, only to have Gunn betray Rocky when the money and fame start coming in (for Gunn) is another element you see in real life and sports. I like the final fight as it takes the fight out of the ring and into the street showing that street smarts is just as important as ring (or book) smarts. For me it's Rocky I, Rocky II, and Rocky V that are my three favorites that I watch. I usually skip Rocky III and Rocky IV as they got a little more 80s action figurish and the ""heart of the underdog"" tone was semi-gone although they are still great films. Don't shy away from this film because the story line is different or because it faces reality that hits a lot of fallen sports stars. This should be the film that every wild spending new football stars must watch as it speaks a tone of ""be careful or you'll end up back in the gutter that you started in"". As for the complaints about rap music in this film instead of ""Eye of the Tiger"" or ""Gonna Fly Now"". The soundtrack music was fitting the music of this films time period (1989-1991) and very much appropiate. Just like we found disco in Rocky I and II (You Take My Heart Away by Shirley Bassey in Rocky I, and All of My Life by Shirley Bassey in Rocky II both late 1970s disco songs), and the 1980s rock music found in Rocky III and IV, rap fits fine with Rocky V and its more of a workout ""get tough"" type rap music like ""Go For It"" by Joey B. Ellis . You must watch Rocky I and II with full attention to understand the meaning of Rocky V. The reality of life is that sometimes when all is said and done, we end up back where we started from, no matter how much we gain and than lose in between it all. Don't miss out on Rocky V!

The acting is much improved this time with an excellent supporting role of George Washington Duke, a Don King wanna-be, played by Richard Gant. What I like about this fifth part is how Stallone was able to make Rocky to go back to his old roots, act the usual Rocky, and bring some new issues rather than play the same tired formula. The street fight adds a new dimension for the series, making Rocky as a street-fighter. Moreover, John G. Avildsen is able to bring more intensity, not found in the past two movies, in the issues between Rocky and Tommy and at the same time with his family than into the motivation build-up prior to big fights. It is a nice acting job by Tommy Morrison. I really enjoy this movie a lot better than the 3rd and 4th parts, although failing to meet the standards of Rocky II, let alone the very first movie.7/11: For a while, I've always thought Rocky V to be the black sheep of the series. It just doesn't quite fit in. After seeing it again, I appreciate it more, and it is a nice break from the same cliched plot. A lot of people has noticed the dramatic change in the son, especially in puberty growth, but I actually like Sage much more than the cartoon unrelated boy from previous part. He looks and plays the part well. The best performance among the cast is obviously Richard Gant who plays the Don King clone. One thing to like about the film is the skillful editing. And another was the recapture of the old Rocky acting style by Sylvester Stallone. That is sorely missed in the past two films. He is really good in it. Anyway, I am looking more forward to the final part since it is obviously one of the best films of the series. I am raising the rating of the film from `6' to `7'.",4,"Well, I Liked It.",1311811200,"07 28, 2011",2011,2015,"['Viewed', '12/03', '12/05', '7/11Rate', '712/05', 'Rocky', 'V', 'nice', 'resurgence', 'back', 'top', 'form', 'Rocky', 'series', 'mostly', 'due', 'reason', 'John', 'G.', 'Avildsen', 'taking', 'up', 'helm', 'directing', 'instead', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'One', 'touching', 'scene', 'shown', 'Rocky', 'Mickey', 'old', 'gym', 'acting', 'much', 'improved', 'time', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'role', 'George', 'Washington', 'Duke', 'Don', 'King', 'wanna-be', 'played', 'Richard', 'Gant', 'What', 'like', 'fifth', 'part', 'how', 'Stallone', 'was', 'able', 'make', 'Rocky', 'go', 'back', 'old', 'roots', 'act', 'usual', 'Rocky', 'bring', 'new', 'issues', 'rather', 'play', 'same', 'tired', 'formula', 'street', 'fight', 'new', 'dimension', 'series', 'making', 'Rocky', 'street-fighter', 'Moreover', 'John', 'G.', 'Avildsen', 'able', 'bring', 'more', 'intensity', 'not', 'found', 'past', 'two', 'movies', 'issues', 'Rocky', 'Tommy', 'same', 'time', 'family', 'motivation', 'build-up', 'prior', 'big', 'fights', 'nice', 'acting', 'job', 'Tommy', 'Morrison', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'lot', 'better', '3rd', '4th', 'parts', 'failing', 'meet', 'standards', 'Rocky', 'II', 'let', 'alone', 'very', 'first', 'movie.7/11', 'while', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'Rocky', 'V', 'be', 'black', 'sheep', 'series', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'seeing', 'again', 'appreciate', 'more', 'nice', 'break', 'same', 'cliched', 'plot', 'lot', 'people', 'noticed', 'dramatic', 'change', 'son', 'especially', 'puberty', 'growth', 'actually', 'Sage', 'much', 'more', 'cartoon', 'unrelated', 'boy', 'previous', 'part', 'part', 'well', 'best', 'performance', 'cast', 'obviously', 'Richard', 'Gant', 'who', 'Don', 'King', 'clone', 'One', 'thing', 'like', 'film', 'skillful', 'editing', 'was', 'recapture', 'old', 'Rocky', 'acting', 'style', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'sorely', 'missed', 'past', 'two', 'films', 'really', 'good', 'Anyway', 'am', 'looking', 'more', 'forward', 'final', 'part', 'obviously', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'series', 'am', 'raising', 'rating', 'film', '6', '7']",Rocky 5 VHS
288926,A2582KMXLK2P06,6301982746,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","I've been extremely skeptical to rewatch Rocky 5.  The reason being, everyone says it's nowhere near as good as the previous four.  I originally watched this film when it first came out, but haven't had a chance to rewatch it until now (actually I didn't have any desire to see it again until now).Well, I'm an adult now, and I can appreciate films a lot better than I did 20 years ago, so approaching this film with an open mind, the million dollar question is, how does Rocky 5 stand up to the previous Rocky classics?  Honestly, it's almost on the same level of quality and storytelling.The ONLY negative thing I can find with Rocky 5 is that the fight scene that takes place at the end has almost entirely NO build-up whatsoever.  It just happens rather suddenly, and as quickly as it comes, it's over with.  *This* is probably the only disappointing moment in the entire movie, but the rest of the film does a brilliant job focusing on Rocky training a new guy, and dealing with family issues as well.Actually his son puts on a great acting performance by starting off like a nerd who doesn't even know how to defend himself when a couple young boys give him a hard time by punching him and stealing his things, then becoming smarter and stronger through lots of training and eventually coming back to kick some school bully behind!The majority of the film however, deals with a young kid from Oklahoma visiting Philadelphia that seems to be in dire need of needing immediate training to become a boxer, and is very insistent on Rocky being his trainer.With Rocky's help, the kid elevates all the way to the top of the division... but as he continues winning and winning, he develops an arrogant attitude, hangs around the wrong people, and eventually this leads to a final showdown with Rocky himself.I honestly thoroughly enjoy Rocky 5, and I recommend everyone watch it.

288928,A1YB29BIDULEYE,6301982746,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[12, 15]","After seeing this movie, I was somewhat surprised that it is commonly referred to as the worst chapter in the ""Rocky"" saga. In many ways, it is actually the most profound and memorable one. I know director John Avildsen (director of the original ""Rocky"") was reluctant to retake his position as director, but he really outdid himself in this final chapter. The movie starts with a brief recap of Rocky's fight in the Soviet Union. (The end of ""Rocky IV."") As many times before, Rocky enjoys the roaring crowds. However, he learns that this time it came with a horrible price. (Serious brain damage) When Rocky and his crew return home, they encounter the shifty George Washington Duke. (Kind of a fast talking businessman in the field.) He wants Rocky to accept a challenge from a younger boxer named Union Cane. But Rocky's injuries will not allow him to do so. A previous reviewer put it quite well when he said that: ""Throughout the series, we have all heard that Rocky needs to stop fighting before. But somehow, (probably through John Avildsen's directing), we get the impression that this time, it's the real thing."" I grant that it is outside plausibility how all of a sudden Rocky and his family have lost their fortune. (One annoying flaw) Well moving on, Director John Avildsen created a beautiful scene when Rocky reopens the gym and has the flashback with Mickey. (This will eventually distinguish Rocky's character.) Soon afterwards, Rocky and Tommy Gun meet. Their relationship starts nice enough, though Tommy does reveal a character flaw. (Learning to fight by punching his drunk father.) Rocky decides to train Tommy to fight in his place. Rocky now finds himself in Mickey's position. (Good.) It isn't long before Rocky pushes Tommy Gun almost to the top. This is when things start to go bad. Duke realizes that if he can't get Rocky to fight, he can probably get Rocky's new student to fight. After a not so long 'eventually,' Tommy forgets about loyalty and starts to think more of the fame and rewards. It is tempting for us to despise Tommy for this. However, we are probably hypocrites if we do. At one or more points in our lives, we were most certainly guilty of this. Despite defeating the current champion, Tommy Gun realizes that many people dislike him for abandoning Rocky. So now, Tommy decides that taking down his mentor and friend is the way to get the reputation and fame that he wants so much. (Once we start gaining, we never have enough. Another sad human flaw.) Again, we may be repulsed by this shameful act, but we probably all have 'bitten the hand that fed us' for our own selfish purposes. This leads to a bitter confrontation between Tommy Gun and the mentor that was so kind to him. In all honesty, this was really an ideal concluding chapter. Rather than just seeing Rocky in the ring AGAIN, we see him reflect moral values despite his brain damage. (Nice paradox) We also get to see him train someone; And where the final confrontation is concerned, rather than Rocky fighting an opponent we just want him to beat, there is the tragic old mentor vs the young student who showed promise. How different is this from the Obi Wan Kenobi vs Anakin scenario? (One might actually wonder if the people who made ""Star Wars III"" took a look at this movie.) And if we are a little sad that this fight had to take place, we should be. It's a sad reality that the protege or side kick often starts loyal and dedicated, but eventually he wants more for himself, and will eventually care more about his own advancement and be willing to betray his trainer if need be.

But his comfortable retirement is likewise cut short when the accountant Paulie hired absconds with all their money, and they have to move back to the old neighborhood. A slick fight promoter nags him to return to the ring, and he resists, but sees a way to recover some of his glory when a young boxer asks Rocky to train him.Rocky gets so caught up in the training that he neglects his family, and his son gets in trouble, and then everything is solved by a quick father/son chat and a fistfight outside a bar.Mostly, it was boring. The beginning of the movie was just flashback after flashback of the previous movies, interspersed with repeated nagging from the promoter and incessant reminders that if he fights, he'll die. Adrian was her usual annoying, whiny self, and Paulie was more useless than ever.

Unfortunately, it staggers like a sottish man in several spots, notably in the training/fight/climax sequences. This sequel barely felt like a true ROCKY film in the music department, with the crap rap noise that tries very lamely to pass itself off as 'music' instead of the true music by Bill Conti/Vince DiCola that is an integral part of the franchise.Since Mr. Avlidsen released a Director's Cut of the film online about 14 years ago, I have a feeling that this sequel was taken over by the studio and re-edited against Mr. Avlidsen's wishes. I feel that, had Mr. Stallone directed the movie, it would have come out a real winner, like the other five movies in the franchise. The Director's Cut includes several scenes that do not appear in the theatrical cut, including a scene with Little Marie, who is now a whore, as Rocky predicted she would end up if she kept on hanging with the wrong sort of people, in the first film, a beautiful love scene between Rocky and Adrian, with music from the first film, music from the fourth film is used during the training/fight/training montages (some of which are fully fleshed out scenes in the Director's Cut), and most importantly, music from the first film intercut with Rocky remembering his fight with Clubber Lang (Mr. T.) and seeing a hallucination of Mickey during the climax. I personally think that if some things from the theatrical cut had been combined with the Director's Cut, it would have been a much better film instead of the mixed bag it turned out to be.The Director's Cut of the film is available for viewing on YouTube.

288946,A1TV81GEGH1TQT,6301982746,"Helena ""Mona""","[4, 7]","To start off, this is a very underrated film. I'm a huge fan of the Rocky films. It's actually one of the better Rocky movies in my opinion. Just because it doesn't have a boxing match or it's ""weak"" and Rocky is broke doesn't mean it is a horrible movie. It's beautiful. It's bittersweet. It's original. People go broke, they get sick, stuff happens, that's life.Rocky returns home from Russia only to find he has brain damage inflicted on him in the ring by the Ivan Drago. Rocky then discovers that his fortune is gone thanks to Adrian's brother Paulie, who has been squandered by their incompetent accountant. Rocky is forced to sell everything and the family is left broke.Despite all this, Rocky reluctantly goes back to Philadelphia to start over since medical condition prevents him from boxing. The changes prove to be difficult to Robert(Rocky's son) who quickly becomes involved with a bad crowd, and encounters a bully. Financially desperate, Rocky is tempted to re-enter the ring when shady promoter George Washington Duke offers him a huge amount of money to defend his title. Duke is a very irritating and pushy character. Adrian proves to have the brains in this film as well as in the Balboa clan. She insists that Rocky not risk his life by returning to the ring. Rocky's financial future looks bleak, until he Rocky meets Tommy Gunn, who idolizes Rocky and begs Rocky to train him. Rocky reopens Mickey's gym and begins to train Tommy. The two become good friends, like brothers almost, which puts a strain on Rocky's relationship with his son. He relives his memories through Tommy and becomes alive again while losing himself and his family in the process.After Tommy the ""Machine Gun"" wins his first few matches, he starts becoming arrogant. George Washington Duke notices Tommy and Tommy leaves Rocky for Duke. In the end Rocky cannot compete with the money, women, and high-priced prizes being offered to Tommy by Duke. The events lead to a nasty confrontation between the two. The street fight in the end is classic. It's very entertaining.The poignant scenes with Mickey makes Rocky an even more original and loveable character. They distinguish his character. Those moments in the film brought tears to my eyes.This story is beautiful and Rocky is still a loveable and memorable character.The movie has some humor to it too. Uncle Paulie is still a funny guy. One part that made me giggle was when Rocky told Adrian ""I can't wait to get you upstairs and violate you like a parking meter"".I mean, how can you not laugh? It's funny.This story also shows the true meaning of family. What really touched me is the love that Rocky still has for Adrian.There are some flaws in the movie though. Rocky, Adrian, and Robert have all noticeably aged and Rocky has gone back to his mumbling ways. You got to turn up the volume a bit more to understand what Rocky is saying. Oh well. It's still good.Btw, don't listen to the other crappy reviews.

The basic story is that while Rocky is away, bringing down communism, his corrupt accountant has squandered all of Rocky's fortune.  He was able to do this because Paully convinced Rocky to sign a power of attorney.Rocky is unable to continue fighting because he has developed brain trauma.  He is also unable to do commercials because people have been looking into his past affiliation with low level mob figures.Rocky returns to the Mickey's Gym which is now owned in his son's name.  There a young hopeful boxer, Tommy Gunn, gets Rocky to be his manager.  Rocky starts devoting his energies to train Tommy and also continue fighting vicariously through him.  During all this Rocky has been neglecting his own son and is being taunted by a shameless promoter known as the Duke (striking resemblance to Don King).It all plays out in the end with Rocky fighting his new protege and regaining the love and trust of his son.This wouldn't have been too bad of a storyline but it has way too many holes.  How long was Rocky in Russia for?  His son ages around 10 years while he is gone.  I would feel a little distant from my dad too.  Rocky was always a bit punchy but when would he have ever listened to Paully for financial advice.  He most certainly would have deferred to Adrian on this.  Secondly the accountant would have needed Adrian's signature on everything.  Adrian would have certainly started a college fund and trust for her son that no power of attorney would have been able to touch.  Americans love Rocky and would have rallied around him no matter his past.  Even Mike Tyson still draws interest and Rocky is a saint compared to him.How can Rocky lose his house to back taxes?  He would have easily been able to raise the funds from selling the gym and Paully's house.  Why is every good fighter white and every bad fighter black?  Certainly there would have been considerable residuals from previous marketing campaigns Rocky did, remember all the merchandise and commercials from Rocky III?This movie just does not work for me.  It was reported that Rocky II was written in 30 hours.  I think this was written in 30 minutes.  I had the entire Rocky set given to me as a gift.

I would have been happy with it had it been completely bland and average. Yet what I found was a compelling chapter in the history of Rocky. Now, I will admit, it is easily the black sheep of the six Rocky films and I can completely understand why some people didn't enjoy it as much as the other entries. Yet to me, this was a mandatory bridge between Rocky IV and Balboa (the highly acclaimed final film of the series) even though at the time of filming, Sly thought V would be the final story told. Not only does it guide us through the aftermaths of the most brutal Rocky fight ever against the roided machine of a man Ivan Drago but it gives us glimpses into the mind of a man who's slowly moving past his prime physically but not mentally or emotionally. In fact, most of the fighting in this film is between Rocky and himself and doesn't need a training montage or a smack talking opponent with 24 pack abs to make it compelling.Stallone clearly wanted to bring this film full circle and try to connect it with the original. After Rocky returns home from Russia with a few less brain cells that were beaten out of him by Drago, he finds that his brother-in-law made some bone headed financial decisions and they've now lost most of their fortune. This forces Rocky, his wife and young son to move back to his original stomping grounds in Philly. It's an unpleasant change of scenery most notable for Rocky's kid (who managed to age about half a decade in six weeks but we'll get back to that later.) and this, along with Rocks own insecurity and his budding relationship with a now apprentice Tommy Gunns, this all leads to the deterioration of the Balboa home. An alienated son, and a wife (albeit a little unsupportive at times) who fears her husband will lose all he has left, to recapture something he can never hold again. At the center of all of this, the new apprentice, the loss of money, the family breaking, the pain of losing his mentor Mick and his former rival turned best friend Apollo Creed is Rockys fear. The fear that he can't give up fighting, or support his family, the fear for his health his intelligence and sanity. The fear that he's being completely consumed by the losses that he has had to face. That right there is what I believe to be the staple of the film. FEAR. As Stallone explains during a scene, either you control your fear and it allows you to take yourself to the next level, or it consumes you and you burn down everything in your life. As the film continues, we see how both Rocky and Tommy each have to deal with the issue of fear and which side each one of them comes down on.Again, i'd like to give a disclaimer, this is not your average Rocky film. There is no smooth and smack talking opponent. No tank of a man who killed someone Rocky cared about and now he must destroy him for it. The build-up we would normally find is non existence and instead of the confrontation between opponents having a slow build, like a forest fire destroying acres of land slowly. It's like a brutal house fire, starting unexpectedly and devouring everything in its path before turning to smoke among the ashes. Also, Sly and co. manage to ""trim the fat"" that slightly plagued certain aspects of III & IV (two films I love dearly. You will not find any of the oddball and sometimes unnecessary charm that appeared in those two films. You will find no overplayed soundtracks, used solely to play long winded montage scenes of Rocky running on the beach in slow motion. Nor is there a robot butler. In fact i still scratch my head at that aspect of Rocky IV. As I said before, Sly wanted to take us back in time to the first two films, especially the first. People were losing faith in Rocky as he wallowed through the slums of his hometown and that's what this film again is able to portray in the series. A lot of the grit of the series returns, while simultaneously trying to pull the series in a new direction, the reaction seems mixed, even by Stallone himself but I think it was a turning point in the franchise, as i look back and see all the pieces.When I hear people complain about the direction of the film, or anything of that nature my first response is always the same, ""What do you expect?"" I love Rocky IV and watch it religiously and I will stand by the idea that the Rocky V. Ivan fight was the most brutal in the history of the series. Those two men beat the piss out of each other in a barbaric nature. Did you expect Rocky to just pick himself up and move on like nothing ever happened? The first five minutes of this film really show the post Drago fight with incredible honesty and dignity. Even though Rocky won, it nearly killed him. So to have this film have been another high profile fight with a towering opponent would have been too much for me. At the very least in this film the cast and crew still show love for the series by trying to push it into a new direction.NOW, to finally address some negatives that people don't seem to really care for much in the series. The kid managed to grow quite a bit while the family was in Russia, eh? Maybe my love of the film helps brush off this odd aspect of the film but I figure that Stallone really wanted his son involved in the film and personally I can't blame the guy for wanting that. It doesn't hurt that father/son relationships play such a big role in the film, be it Rock and the kid or Tommy and his abusive father. So being that he was probably writing this script and thinking about his own son, why not have his own son in the actual film? i know it's not much of a defense but it's all I got and I did knock off 0.5 from my final score because of it. Also, the action is a little lacking compared to other films, there's not the major triumphant of the first two films or the horrible circumstances Rock must overcome like in III and IV but that's not what this film is about. The film is about Rocky and himself he doesn't need to fight the guy at the beginning because he has nothing to prove and the reason he fights at the end is for himself, not money, fame or anybody else. Which finally brings me to the final fight, no it was not in front of thousands of screaming fans in a packed arena. It's in an alley, it's on the streets with only people built from the same concrete as Rock, it's a huge metaphor for the entire film and is a huge plus, not a major negative for me.Lastly but obviously not least, the greatest aspect of this film for me is the flashbacks of Mick and how they keep Rocky alive throughout. The man really was Rocky's guardian angel because at every turn in the film, when he's down or about to be beaten, he goes back to thoughts of his mentor and the advice he gave him and it gives him that final push. It brings them full circle and shows the beauty of the father/son relationship that they had formed. It proved that Tommy was broken and he broke off something that could have been great for the sake of money and people who didn't really care about. He went down the road Rocky promised him he shouldn't go down and it would lead him to down a dark path.In conclusion, this film has heart in every possible aspect and it shows Rocky overcoming his biggest obstacle, his own fear and self doubt. I implore you, regardless if you're a longtime fan of Rocky or a first time viewer. Watch this film with an open mind and I can guarantee you will find something to love.",5,"(4.5) Hey, Critics.

288949,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,6301982746,Jason,"[4, 4]","As a Rocky aficionado, this movie disappoints me in so many ways.  It nearly tarnishes the Rocky legacy, and should simply never have been made.  If it weren't for the fact that Rocky I-IV are so stupendous (with Rocky IV being simply one of the best action movies of all time), this could have really hurt Sylvester Stallone's career.Rocky IV left us with the champ just getting through the fight of his life against Russian behemoth with hammers for fists and enough chemical enhancements to drop a horse.  Not only that, but Rocky was taking on a cold-war powerhouse, an entire country, and communism as a whole.  He was crazy-busy.  It's a good thing he signed over power of attorney to Paulie for all those pesky multi-million dollar financial details.Meanwhile, Adrian never double-checked the finances on her gravy train - because she was too busy harping at Rocky - and lets Paulie squander the Balboa fortune faster than MC Hammer could have.  Soon Rocky has moved back into the slums of Philly, can't fight because of a brain tumor - which is not shocking at all considering his fighting style, and has been relegated to training an up-and-coming boxer named Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrisson) in Mickey's old gym.  During the training, Rocky treats Tommy like a surrogate son while neglecting his own son.  Speaking of his son, this is one of my biggest problems with Rocky V.In Rocky IV he was like six years old, a believer in Santa and the Easter Bunny, but just a few days later in Rocky V he's damn-near growing a mustache.  Either there is a huge plot hole, or the kid's part werewolf.Exactly how long was Rocky in Russia?Much like her son, Adrian (Talia Shire) is also a horrible character.  She once again seems to hate the fact that Rocky is a boxer, telling him that he can't win, that he's washed up, that he's going to die - just like she has done in seemingly every previous Rocky movie.  She sure doesn't seem to be bothered by the furs, the fancy cars, the means to buy someone a robot, the jewelry, her ginormous house, or her plastic surgery throughout the years.She's yet again the Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars, the Zander Barcalow from Starship Troopers - the character who doesn't help the movie's plot, and creates forced sexual drama or a love triangle where it is not needed or wanted.  In fact, I think we can all blame Adrian's character for creating the ""pointless love interest in an otherwise great sports movie""-niche.  She essentially caused Barbara Hershey in Hoosiers, Susan Sarandon in Bull Durham, and Barbara Hershey in The Natural.Anyway, the story comes full circle as Rocky learns that what matters most is family and friends as he meets up with his easily influenced prot&eacute;g&eacute; in a knock-down, drag-out street brawl finale.  Lesson learned, he walks away without a belt, but he's still the champ.",2,"As far as I'm concerned, this movie never happened",1216857600,"07 24, 2008",2008,2852,"['Rocky', 'aficionado', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'nearly', 'Rocky', 'legacy', 'should', 'simply', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'were', ""n't"", 'fact', 'Rocky', 'I-IV', 'are', 'so', 'stupendous', 'Rocky', 'IV', 'being', 'simply', 'one', 'best', 'action', 'movies', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'hurt', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'career.Rocky', 'IV', 'left', 'champ', 'just', 'getting', 'fight', 'life', 'Russian', 'behemoth', 'hammers', 'fists', 'enough', 'chemical', 'enhancements', 'drop', 'horse', 'Not', 'only', 'Rocky', 'was', 'taking', 'cold-war', 'powerhouse', 'entire', 'country', 'communism', 'whole', 'was', 'crazy-busy', 'good', 'thing', 'signed', 'over', 'power', 'attorney', 'Paulie', 'pesky', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'financial', 'details.Meanwhile', 'Adrian', 'never', 'double-checked', 'finances', 'gravy', 'train', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'harping', 'Rocky', 'lets', 'Paulie', 'squander', 'Balboa', 'fortune', 'faster', 'MC', 'Hammer', 'could', 'have', 'Soon', 'Rocky', 'moved', 'back', 'slums', 'Philly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fight', 'brain', 'tumor', 'not', 'shocking', 'considering', 'fighting', 'style', 'been', 'relegated', 'training', 'up-and-coming', 'boxer', 'named', 'Tommy', 'Gunn', 'Tommy', 'Morrisson', 'Mickey', 'old', 'gym', 'training', 'Rocky', 'Tommy', 'surrogate', 'son', 'neglecting', 'own', 'son', 'Speaking', 'son', 'one', 'biggest', 'problems', 'Rocky', 'V.In', 'Rocky', 'IV', 'was', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'believer', 'Santa', 'Easter', 'Bunny', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'Rocky', 'V', 'damn-near', 'growing', 'mustache', 'huge', 'plot', 'hole', 'kid', 'part', 'werewolf.Exactly', 'how', 'long', 'was', 'Rocky', 'Russia', 'Much', 'son', 'Adrian', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'also', 'horrible', 'character', 'once', 'again', 'hate', 'fact', 'Rocky', 'boxer', 'telling', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'washed', 'up', 'going', 'die', 'just', 'done', 'seemingly', 'previous', 'Rocky', 'movie', 'sure', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'bothered', 'furs', 'fancy', 'cars', 'means', 'buy', 'someone', 'robot', 'jewelry', 'ginormous', 'house', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'years.She', 'yet', 'again', 'Jar', 'Jar', 'Binks', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Zander', 'Barcalow', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'help', 'movie', 'plot', 'creates', 'forced', 'sexual', 'drama', 'love', 'triangle', 'where', 'not', 'needed', 'wanted', 'fact', 'think', 'can', 'blame', 'Adrian', 'character', 'creating', 'pointless', 'love', 'interest', 'otherwise', 'great', 'sports', 'movie', '-niche', 'essentially', 'caused', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'Hoosiers', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Bull', 'Durham', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'Natural.Anyway', 'story', 'full', 'circle', 'Rocky', 'what', 'most', 'family', 'friends', 'up', 'easily', 'influenced', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'knock-down', 'drag-out', 'street', 'brawl', 'finale', 'Lesson', 'learned', 'away', 'belt', 'still', 'champ']",Rocky 5 VHS
288950,A37D0OP19KETVY,6301982746,"""jcjarss""","[1, 3]","This film is different from the other sequels, which makes it one of the best in the series.  Directed by the director of the original Rocky, ROCKY V goes back to its oscar-winning roots.  It takes place right after the fight with Drago where Rocky comes home not feeling quite right after the bout.  At the airport, he's confronted by a Don King-type person who continuously wants to see him fight.  Later, it seemed that Paulie (Burt Young) had screwed up some papers with the Balboa's accountant thereby bankrupting them.  And Rocky finds out he suffered severe brain trauma and is unable to fight.  Rocky and his family are forced to live back in Philadelphia.  There Rocky meets Tommy Gunn, and up and coming boxer who he agrees to manage only so he can get the thrill he had before he was forced to retire.  Tommy Gunn later gets corrupted by that Don King type and ditches Rocky.  In the midst of all this, Rocky starts to lose his family, especially his son(Sage Stallone, his real-life son) After Gunn gets the heavyweight title, he is bitterly hated for abandoning Rocky and not truly getting the title from Rocky.  So he confronts Rocky in a blind rage and ends up fighting him in a street fight.  Guess who wins?  It is a great end to the series with strong performances by Stallone, Shire, Morrisson, and even Stallone's son a little bit.  The score by Conti is mediocore with rap ensembles and some familar Rocky tunes.  The ending street fight has a remix theme of several memorable themes throughout the series.  But in the end, the Elton John song &quot;Measure of a Man&quot; makes this movie what it is.  It is played over the credits and black and white photos throughout the series, ending in the final shot of the Rocky statue at the top of those famous stairs.  It's very conclusive.  Speaking of shots, the choreography itself is done spectacularly, especially in the street fight when a whole bunch of images flash before Rocky's eyes that motivate him to fight Tommy Gunn.

288951,ANAKWVSRJHAFB,6301982746,Jeff,"[1, 1]","I remember seeing Rocky V as an 8 year old kid, and was disapointed with it.  Until a few months ago when I viewed it again, I felt this way until wathcing it late at night, and concentrated on Rocky V as a totally seperate movie from the previous four.  When doing it this way, Rocky V is not a half bad film.  It certainly doesn't have that feel good spirit the other four had.  There isn't much to be happy about, and we don't get to see Rockky have a motivational training sequence.  There also is no Apollo Creed which instnatly kills off the pace of this film.  However, Rocky V I feel ranks right up with the first one when it comes to acting.It isn't so much Stallone who improves, but somehow, he convinces you his brain is damaged.  But it's the new comers to this movie which actually make it such a well acted movie.  Richard Gant plays the scum bag Don King impersonator George Washington Duke and he does the role well.  Give him Don King's hair, and you have a Don King.  Ex Pro Boxer Tommy Morrison acts pretty darn well for his one and only movie.  He carried himself like a seasoned veteran in this film, but the one who really steals the show is Stallone's son Sage.  The fact that Rocky's son ages from 5-14 in about 2 years worth of time between Rocky 3 and 5, Sage Stallone like Morrison carried himself like he had done many movies.  You really see the transition from a snobby yet kindhearted richkid, to intimidated to his new environment, to being a punk in the poorhouse, to a kid learning to adjust in the end.  He plays it perfectly.  Why Sage's career didnt take off I don't know.  His only other role was a supporting role in another Stallone movie &quot;Daylight&quot;.  I hear it's his choice, but I'm not sure.In the end, is this the worst of the 5 Rocky's?  I feel the 2nd was.

It should actually be rated ""3 1/2 stars.""What makes this movie better than number 4?The storyline is better thought out. It again focuses on psychological themes. Balboa is brain damaged and ripped off by his accountant.  Rocky and his family now have to start over in the same neighborhood he originally escaped. Being well into his 40s (or near 50?), the boxer is too old and too injured to fight. He can train fighters, however, and he reopens Mickey's gym and makes a go of it.An ambitious brawler named ""Tommy Gunn"" wants a manager, and Rocky sees a potential for success once again.Unfortunately, Rocky starts to neglect his family. His poor son is being bullied, and needs to ""toughen up"" on his own. His Dad is completely preoccupied with Tommy.Tommy is actually a ""Judas,"" and sells out to a corrupt promoter that's a crude characterature of Don King.Rocky's Judas needs to ""escape Rocky's shadow,"" and is convinced by the promoter to defeat his old mentor in the ring. Instead of falling into the trap, Rocky is provocated into brawling with Tommy in the street.Again, Balboa finds his self respect ... and lives happily ever after with his family.Why is this movie WEAKER than the first three?The tacky ""rap music,"" complete with the overused chant ""go for it!""The manic, shaking, abrupt editing style of the fighting.... designed to make it ""more dramatic."" It just becomes annoying.The same weakness Rocky 4 had... this aging fighter would have little chance against the young and powerful brute.

His head must be so bad that he doesn't notice that his son is like 12 or 13 now instead of 8 yrs old like he was when he left him in part 4 to go to Russia lol. Rocky has to retire since he suffered some brain damage. They can't afford their big house anymore and have to move back to the streets where Rocky grew up. Meanwhile I'm sure they could've got good money for Paulie's big talking robot maid that Rocky bought Paulie in Rocky 4 lol. After Rocky revisits Mick's old gym, he decides to be a train people there. A young boxer named Tommy Gunn persues Rocky to be his new manager. Rocky is against it at first but decides to eventually.Rocky gets so close to him that he doesn't notice that he's ignoring his own son and that he's not happy. Which starts to hurt their relationship. Since Rocky never actually boxes in this one, the movie is a little more forgettable than the others. This movie is more in tune with the original style of the first movie than it's like the flashy and cartoonish ""but entertaining Rocky 4"".It's more about Rocky's struggle after boxing and how hard it is for him to not actually be in the ring himself. When managing Tommy, he basically sees himself in the kid but Paulie warns him that he's not anything like him. Especially after Tommy starts to listen to a sleazy promoter instead of Rocky. He believes he's ready for a title and that Rocky is holding him back. The promoter gets in his head so much that he's soon picking a fight with Rocky but don't expect an actual boxing match betwen the two.

Menta, Jr.","[1, 1]","Despite still being enjoyable, there was a general feeling among critics and the public back in the late 80's that the last couple of ""Rocky"" movies had gotten a little too cartoonish, broad, and simplistic (especially ""Rocky IV"").  So Sylvester Stallone enlisted the aid of original ""Rocky"" director John G. Avildsen to help bring the series back down to earth with 1990's ""Rocky V"".  The results are generally positive, though bringing subtlety back to the ""Rocky"" series was kind of like trying to put the toothpaste back into the tube.  That is, some of the little storylines and themes, though character based and well acted, STILL felt a little simple and broad.  For example, Rocky has to learn that he shouldn't put all his attention and emotions behind the new fighter he is training, to the exclusion of his son, who needs his attention more.  This is a nice lesson, but an obvious one.But numerous small touches of the non-obvious variety abound.  I liked how Rocky Jr. was falling prey to a bully until his father showed him how to defend himself.  Seeing Rocky Jr. knocking the bully down was admittedly satisfying but still predictable and obvious, but a couple of scenes later it was nice to see the bully sitting with Rocky Jr. watching TV in the Balboa living room.  It was a subtle grace note, not pounded home with obvious dialogue, showing how kids are often better than adults at getting past feuds and fights and becoming friends.  There were several little touches like this throughout the film.In many ways ""Rocky V"" is an awkward, gawky type of film, what with its dragging itself kicking and screaming back to a more subtle form of storytelling after Rocky effectively brought down communism in the previous installment.  It attempts to keep the big, inspirational tone of the last couple of movies while simultaneously trying to bring back the intimacy of the first two films, and the fit isn't always perfect.  So I can understand those who don't particularly like the movie.  But I don't understand those who actively hate it.

Rocky returns from Russia with apparent brain damage, and his wife Adrian forbids him to fight professionally.  Compounding their problems, they have lost all their money through a blunder by brother Paulie, and they have to move back into the old rough tough neighborhood of hard knocks.Rocky V is a story of family.  How will the family pull together to survive this setback?  Rocky has a pre-teen son and although he loves him like a precious gem, the Rock is distracted from his son and his relationship with him, when another fighter, Tommy Gun, (Tommy Morrison) asks Balboa to train and manage him.  So Tommy Gun becomes Rocky's surrogate son and Rocky sees himself in Tommy Gun and pours all of his energy and love into developing Tommy Gun while neglecting the emotional needs of his own son.  There is also tension between Adrain and Rocky, as she sees Rocky neglecting his family for one last shot of fame thorugh Tommy Gun.  The scenes with Adrian are realistic and passionite, and I admire her (acting) ability to stand up to her famous husband to set his straight.  She is the moral compass in his life.  Witout Adrian, Rocky would be adrift at see without a rudder.Abruptly, Tommy Gun is lured away from Rocky's teaching and guidance by a ""Don King-like"" charcter.  Gun wins the championship and does not find his fans pleased with him, as they resent him for abandoning the man who got him to the top - Rocky Balboa.  So, unrealistically, Tommy Gun initiates a street brawl with Balboa outside the neighborhood bar.  It is a fight to the finish.  Rocky settles his differences with Tommy Gun in a protracted physical battle.Some highlights of the film are when Rocky goes back to Mick's gym and we view a flashback of Mick training Rocky for the Apollo Creed bout and telling Rocky how much he means to him.  It is a touching scene, and Burgess Meridith is excellent in showing his passion and love for Rocky.  Dittos with the scene where Adrian confronts Rocky on the street after Tommy Gun abandones him, and chastises him for losing his family for his devotion to Tommy Gun. Finally, I loved the scene where Rocky goes down to the street corner to reestablish his relationship with his estranged son.  It is touching and realistic, and shows the tender heart of Rocky that we have all come to love.As the movie closes, we are treated to scenes of all the previous Rocky movies, from the very beginning to the end.  From this visual reviewal, it is apparent that this was to be the last Rocky movie.  And it could have ended here on a satisfactory note, as all the key issues in the film have been resolved.  However, Stallone's career did not take off as expected after he had put Rocky to rest, so in 2006, he released the final (final) Rocky movie, which by the way is a treat to watch too.I recommend Rocky 5 as a highly entertaining movie that captures the heart of the character of Rocky and his evolving relationships with his beloved Adrian and his son.Jim 'Konedog"" Koenig",4,Rocky 5 Returns With Personality and Relationships Which Enrich this Film,1168041600,"01 6, 2007",2007,3062,"['many', 'reviewers', 'trash', 'film', 'take', 'different', 'tact', 'Rocky', 'returns', 'Russia', 'apparent', 'brain', 'damage', 'wife', 'Adrian', 'fight', 'professionally', 'Compounding', 'problems', 'have', 'lost', 'money', 'blunder', 'brother', 'Paulie', 'have', 'move', 'back', 'old', 'rough', 'tough', 'neighborhood', 'hard', 'knocks.Rocky', 'V', 'story', 'family', 'How', 'will', 'family', 'pull', 'together', 'survive', 'setback', 'Rocky', 'pre-teen', 'son', 'precious', 'gem', 'Rock', 'distracted', 'son', 'relationship', 'when', 'fighter', 'Tommy', 'Gun', 'Tommy', 'Morrison', 'Balboa', 'train', 'manage', 'So', 'Tommy', 'Gun', 'Rocky', 'surrogate', 'son', 'Rocky', 'Tommy', 'Gun', 'pours', 'energy', 'love', 'developing', 'Tommy', 'Gun', 'neglecting', 'emotional', 'needs', 'own', 'son', 'also', 'tension', 'Adrain', 'Rocky', 'Rocky', 'neglecting', 'family', 'one', 'last', 'shot', 'fame', 'Tommy', 'Gun', 'scenes', 'Adrian', 'are', 'realistic', 'passionite', 'admire', 'acting', 'ability', 'stand', 'up', 'famous', 'husband', 'set', 'straight', 'moral', 'compass', 'life', 'Adrian', 'Rocky', 'would', 'be', 'adrift', 'see', 'rudder.Abruptly', 'Tommy', 'Gun', 'lured', 'away', 'Rocky', 'teaching', 'guidance', 'Don', 'King-like', 'charcter', 'Gun', 'championship', 'not', 'find', 'fans', 'pleased', 'resent', 'abandoning', 'man', 'who', 'got', 'top', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'So', 'unrealistically', 'Tommy', 'Gun', 'street', 'brawl', 'Balboa', 'neighborhood', 'bar', 'fight', 'finish', 'Rocky', 'differences', 'Tommy', 'Gun', 'protracted', 'physical', 'battle.Some', 'highlights', 'film', 'are', 'when', 'Rocky', 'back', 'Mick', 'gym', 'view', 'flashback', 'Mick', 'training', 'Rocky', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'bout', 'telling', 'Rocky', 'how', 'much', 'touching', 'scene', 'Burgess', 'Meridith', 'excellent', 'showing', 'passion', 'love', 'Rocky', 'Dittos', 'scene', 'where', 'Adrian', 'confronts', 'Rocky', 'street', 'Tommy', 'Gun', 'losing', 'family', 'devotion', 'Tommy', 'Gun', 'Finally', 'loved', 'scene', 'where', 'Rocky', 'down', 'street', 'corner', 'reestablish', 'relationship', 'estranged', 'son', 'touching', 'realistic', 'tender', 'heart', 'Rocky', 'have', 'come', 'love.As', 'movie', 'are', 'treated', 'scenes', 'previous', 'Rocky', 'movies', 'very', 'beginning', 'end', 'visual', 'reviewal', 'apparent', 'was', 'be', 'last', 'Rocky', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'here', 'satisfactory', 'note', 'key', 'issues', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'resolved', 'However', 'Stallone', 'career', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'off', 'expected', 'had', 'put', 'Rocky', 'rest', 'so', '2006', 'released', 'final', 'final', 'Rocky', 'movie', 'way', 'treat', 'watch', 'too.I', 'recommend', 'Rocky', '5', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'heart', 'character', 'Rocky', 'evolving', 'relationships', 'beloved', 'Adrian', 'son.Jim', 'Koenig']",Rocky 5 VHS
288964,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,6301982746,L.A. Scene,"[7, 11]","Somewhere in the Rocky series, the character of Rocky Balboa changed from a real character into some sort of a quasi-superhero.  In Rocky IV, although the theme of Rocky being the underdog was still in-tact, it suddenly was Rocky against the Russian (Ivan Drago).  Lost in the shuffle was a story with some depth.  Lost was the outstanding character development - that was particularly strong in the first two Rocky movies.  In fact, more or less - a good chunk of Rocky IV was more of a music video.  When I heard that Rocky V was going to take Rocky back to Philadelphia a broke and down and out fighter, I was disappointed. After watching the movie, I realized that Sylvester Stallone corrected a good number of the problems I saw with Rocky IV and actually created a very good story that would be a perfect way to wrap-up the Rocky series.Here is the story:  After defeating Ivan Drago in Moscow, Rocky returns home to two problems:  1) He is Broke - he left Power of Attorney to a crooked lawyer, who never paid his taxes and made poor investments;  2)  He has health problems:  The years of all of the beatings have damaged his brain - therefore he cannot fight.  Broke and no longer able to fight, the Balboas go bankrupt and basically move back to Inner City Philadelphia.  Rocky still has the old Gym that was his old manager Mickey's and begins to train fighters.  A crooked fight promoter (Don King-like promoter) named George Washington Duke  is trying to lure him for a big fight and Adrian clearly doesn't want him to do this.  Along the way, comes a young Midwestern fighter named Tommy Gunn (played by real-life boxer Tommy Morrison).  Tommy becomes Rocky's protege and Rocky guides him to contention.  While training Tommy, Rocky is ignoring his family - mostly his son (played by Stallone's son Sage Stallone).  Eventually Duke gets to Tommy and convinces him to turn on Rocky.  This leads to a dramatic and exciting street fight confrontation between the two.While the first four movies focused on the theme of the underdog, Rocky V takes a different tact.  The theme seems to be scams and deceptions.  This is prevalent throughout the movie.  This is seen when Rocky loses his money,  Duke trying to lure Rocky into the ring,  Rocky's son getting picked on at school, and Tommy turning on him.There is some great character development and performances in the movie.  I do feel that Adrian's character doesn't really grow that much in the movie, but I was impressed by Tommy and Rocky Jr (called Robert) in this movie.  Both Tommy Morrison and Sage Stallone deliver great performances.  Tommy grows as a character - from a shy, but cocky kid from Oklahoma to the ""turn"" as a bad guy who becomes the World Champion.  We see how Rocky Jr. starts out as ""the rich kid"", but eventually is able to hold his own in a tough school.  But perhaps the surprise of the movie is good ol' Paulie - Rocky's Brother in Law.  In Rocky IV, Paulie still had his sense of humor, but had been relegated to the role of cantankerous curmudgeon.  Throughout the Rocky movies, Rocky always looked out and helped out Paulie.  In Rocky V, Paulie will still be a cantankerous curmudgeon whom Rocky looks out for - but there is a major change.  Toward the end of the movie, Paulie stands up for Rocky.  This happens when Tommy turns on Rocky.  It's Paulie who turns around and reminds Tommy how much Rocky sacrificed for Tommy and stands up to the young kid - very emotional stuff.  Also Richard Gant's performance as Duke is very believable.I like how they fold Burgess Meredith back into the movie.  Although Mickey died in Rocky III, he comes back in Rocky V through some dream sequences.The movie contains plenty of real caemos.  Most noteable are Philadelphia TV Sports personality ""Big Al"" Meltzer and Philadelphia Columnist and Radio Host, Stan Hochman.  Also in the movie are real-life Boxing analysts - Stu Nahan and Al Bernstein.  Real-life referees Lou Filllipo and Frank Cappucino are refs in the movie.One problem that I felt plagued the Rocky series since Rocky II has been Sylvester Stallone over-choreographing the Boxing sequences.  Clearly by Rocky IV, the Boxing sequences were completely unrealistic.  In Rocky V, while there are still some Boxing sequences with Tommy Gunn that are still over-choreographed, Rocky Balboa is not going to get in the ring in this movie at all.  A predictable thing would have been to end with a Boxing match between Rocky and Tommy - and as I watched this movie, that is where I felt it was heading.  However, what happens instead is a Philadelphia Street fight.  While Stallone over-choreographed the Boxing matches, the Street Fight is great.  I found it incredibly exciting and it proved to be the perfect ending.Rocky movies have always had great music - from Bill Conti, to Survivor, to Vince DiCola - it was passionate.  I think Rocky V's music is the weakest of the series as it tended to go more toward rap/street music.  But I also think the music is better used in this movie - instead of as a music video like in Rocky IV, it compliments the movie.  This is very evident when you listen to the music during the Street fight.  However, I think the use of Elton John's ""The Measure of a Man"" as the song in the closing credits is perfect.  It provides the perfect theme to end the movie as well as the Rocky series.  You will also see a montage of clips from all the movies.Overall, while not the award winning caliber of the original, I still enjoy this movie.  It is one of my favorites in the Rocky series.  It deserves a chance, despite the negative reviews.  Highly recommended.",5,Unfairly Criticized - This is one of the better Rocky Movies,1110067200,"03 6, 2005",2005,5635,"['Somewhere', 'Rocky', 'series', 'character', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'changed',

288973,AW83CVXIX7RFI,6301982746,Mike,"[4, 7]","Okay, where to start... In my Rocky collection (I didn't bother to buy the 5-disc set) I have 1 (of course) 4 and...that's it. Anyone who says that the first Rocky was inferior to any of its sequels is cracked. You can't touch it. In part 1, Stallone WAS Rocky. In the sequels, Rocky was just a character he played, each one being worse as they progressed. Rocky in the original movie was a very charming character in his own ""dumb"" way, even when he was breaking guys' thumbs. You were able to sympathize with him and his struggles. A truly genuine performance by Stallone. In part 2, Stallone tries to re-capture this character but comes up short. He does more ""acting"" than ""being"". The movie also moves way to quickly as it is jam-packed with too much story. Part 3. C'mon Stallone. Mickey should've died in part 2 and be out of his misery by this point. I bought 4, not because of its ""superior"" acting, (scoff) or its believeability, (ha!) but because of the Rocky sequels I think it's the only one that holds my attention... Only if I skip through the boring parts. Okay, part 5. First, did'ja ever notice as the Rocky's progressed, Rocky got a little less ""dumb""? He must have been cured buy money, because now that he has returned to being broke, all of a sudden he's dumb again. Maybe it's the brain damage, maybe it's an attempt to re-capture his character. Either way it doesn't work. Of the few things I did like was Rocky's conversation with Mickey, which I found particularly touching. This should have been his only appearance. The one at the end was embarassing. Tommy Gunn. Annoying. 'Nuff said. ""The Duke"", just as bad. Rocky's son, (in real life as well) should be given an Oscar for the movie's only believeable character, and then be shot for being a little ****.

288974,A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,6301982746,"Mike London ""MAC""","[3, 4]","Commonly know as the worst of the Rocky movies (a statement I don't disagree with), ROCKY V shows Rocky broke, brain damaged, and right back to where he started, just another bum around the neighborhood.One thing that is notable about the film is this is the only ROCKY movie that is rated PG-13. All the others are PG. There are two sections involving nudity. The first instant is we get a really gratitious shot of Stallone standing naked in the shower, and unfortunately we see his ass (who needs to see that???). The second instance is a naked picture that Rocky's boy draws of a French lady with extremely large (so large they're a lot more scary than they are sexy) breasts.On coming back from Russia after his fight with Russian opponent Drago, a boxing promoter (clearly modeled after real life promoter Don King, of Mike Tyson fame) tries to set up a fight between Rocky and his own fighter. Rocky, however, declines, as he is having health issues. He goes to see the doctor with Adrian, and it is disclosed he has brain damage.Rocky and Adrian go back to their mansion, but due to financial indiscretion of Paulie, who gave power of attorney to Rocky's accountant, they lose everything, and are forced to go back to the streets of Philly with their son (played by Stallone's real life son Sage Stallone). Their son is having a hard time adjusting, and Rocky makes a big deal out of keeping the relationship with his son alive and well.Along the way, Rocky meets a fighter named Tommy Gunn, played by real-life boxer Tommy Morrison. He starts training him, and Tommy gets a few victories. However, Tommy is not happy as he is not getting any money, so the boxing promoter moves in and essentially buys Tommy out. The boxing promoter's sole agenda is to get Rocky back in the ring, and tries using Tommy against Rocky. By this time Rocky's son is mad because he thinks Rocky hasn't paid him any attention. Rocky renews his relationship with his son.Tommy Gunn shows up at a local bar, wanting to fight Rocky in the ring and Rocky declining. Ultimately, the movie's climax fight is actually a street brawl, and a rather bad street brawl out that.As far as its relationship to the other films, this is the most disappointing of them all. You watch Rocky in the first four films as he becomes successful and a great boxer. Then ROCKY V has Rocky lose everything he has gained in the first four films, and he's right back to where he started - out on the streets, broke. This plotline totally invalidates the spirit of the first four ROCKY films. Now, it's understandable people lose their property thru bad financial decisions, etc, but it's absolutely heartbreaking to see Rocky thrust back to the very place he had risen above. Almost makes you wonder why the hell you went thru the other four films if Rocky starts out just where he began at.As far as the power of attorney bit, Rocky in the first four films is pretty street-smart when it comes to money, and wouldn't legally Rocky or Adrian have to sign off on those forms and not just Paulie? Though people may think the accountant was corrupt, he was actually trying not to steal their money but double it in a deal that ultimately fell through, but that's neither here nor there. Still, I find it hard to believe Rocky wouldn't have more control over his finances than that, though people with a lot of wealth due need financial assistance (just look at Willie Nelson who had IRS troubles because his accountants didn't pay his taxes for years at a time).One thing I will say positive about the film is Rocky's attitude toward the boxing promoter. He warns Tommy Gunn not to take up with the promoter, because the promoter is corrupt and cares only about making money, not about him as a person. Given Rocky's career as a boxer, I think Stallone could have incorporated this plotline into a very good Rocky movie. Unfortunately, this ain't it.Another rather controversial move on Stallone's part was to do a street-fight at the end. While there's nothing wrong with a street-fight, given the climax of the last four films were all ring fights, still it is very disappointing to see Rocky not in the ring. It deviates too far from the format for a large proportion of the Rocky fanbase.Ironically enough, while it is the worst entry in the franchise, for my money it has the single best line in the entire series. It's when he is having his flashbacks with Mickey, and Mickey yells ""Get up, you son of a bitch, cause Mickey loves ya!"" Favorite line out of all six films without a doubt. It perfectly defines Mickey's character, and is a very fun quote to pull out from time to time.One good thing about ROCKY V, though, is it's the real reason why we got ROCKY BALBOA, which is a great way to end the series. Stallone acknowledges V as the worst, and says it didn't end the series on an emotional high note, and he didn't want to leave Rocky like that. Thank God, because ROCKY BALBOA is so much better than V, and a great way to end the series. Strangely enough he dropped the brain damage story in BALBOA. Stallone said the brain damage in ROCKY V, while present, was not as extensive as the doctors' thought. He did not go for a second opinion, and deferred to his wife to quit fighting. However, as the years passed he would be given a clean bill of health.While it is the worst Rocky movie, it's still entertaining. The other five films are much better, but this one is still a somewhat enjoyable film. Just don't go in expecting much.",1,"Stallone, what the hell did you do to Rocky?

288976,A20NJAPECFGIR9,6301982746,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[0, 0]","I believe I was Sage Stallone's age when Rocky V first came out. I've seen all the Rocky films and I am a big Stallone fan. I know the history of Rocky and seeing all the Rocky movies I think I can fairly say that critics and fans are bias against this installment.The claim is that Rocky V was unrealistic and a let down as a film ending. If you ask me the Rocky movies should have stopped at Rocky 2 or at Rocky because it went downhill each sequel. Rocky 2 was BORING. Rocky 3 was fairly entertaining and Rocky 4 stunk to high heaven. Stallone acted like he was bored in Rocky 4! Rocky V is a decent sequel compared to the others. It's no worse than 3 or 4 so it makes you wonder why people hate on it so much.Some say it's not true to the story of Rocky. Bullcrap. Rocky V pissed folks off because it took Rocky back to the beginning. People loved the ""rags to riches"" angle and that's why Rocky became such a success. He was the underdog who always won. I admired Rocky V because it was the only time Rocky seemed to remember where he came from after making it big. In Rocky 3 and 4 Rocky didn't even act like he knew what the streets were, let alone that he'd grown up there. There was no evidence of the original Rocky in either of those sequels. Maybe Stallone made part five to instill some reality back in the character because the Rocky in 3 and 4 acted nothing like the original Rocky. He not only became more educated but he acted like a totally different person with no common sense.People complained about the rap music. Hello it was 1990!  Eye of the Tiger will forever be one of Rocky's known songs but why someone would expect Eye of the Tiger to be the theme of a film from 1990 (an entirely different era than when Survivor made the song) is beyond me and ridiculous! The Rocky films have been made over a period of thirty years! The rap music and other changes in Rocky V were true to what was happening then. In 1990 rap music ruled the charts and that's just how it was. But why such a big deal about the damn music? I think it's another evidence of people nickpicking because they weren't happy with this installment. Tough.As for the street fight thing, it didn't matter to me because it was still entertaining. Rocky V was interesting and lacked the dull moments of Rocky 4, which in my opinion was the worst, silliest and most boring of the Rocky movies! Maybe it's the fact that 5 was supposed to be the end that got folks so riled up but either way, this film isn't as horrible as some claim. Most of the negativity comes from the disappointment from people who didn't like how Stallone ended things. Well not only is there Rocky Balboa but Stallone's contemplating making a seven so those folks should now be happy. I think he should have quit at the first Rocky. Even though I've enjoyed some of the sequels, they were never as good as the first.Of course Rocky V is far from perfect. Stallone goes too far with ""the past"". The part where Rocky starts wearing the same clothes as he did in the first film was silly. I don't think he could have still worn the same clothes in 1990 that he wore in 1976. I also don't think he would have kept those clothes all that time. Who keeps clothes that long? Also the part about Adrienne and her glasses was silly too. Why would she keep glasses from all those years and then didn't even remember she had? And why did she stop wearing her glasses in the first place? She wore them in the first Rocky then all of a sudden never put them back on. I also don't think they needed to go back to the same area they used to live. Just because they were broke doesn't mean they would go back to the old neighborhood. I think Rocky would have been way too embarrassed to go back there after what happened to him. Adrienne talks about going back to work at the pet store??? You mean to say that pet store would still be around? It was too bad they never gave Adrienne a life outside of Rocky. This woman has been married to this man for decades at this point and she has never learned to do anything other than work at the pet store? Please. It also made no sense that Rocky and Adrienne put up with Paulie after what he did. Another silly thing was that Rocky had started acting like a Harvard graduate when he was rich and famous then all of a sudden when he's broke again he's dumb as a brick again? WTF?I recommend Rocky V if you can accept that people and things change and grow with age. It's not perfect but no movie is. With each era came a different Rocky movie and a different Rocky so people can't expect time to stand still. Each film was supposed to be different. My main complaint was that Rocky V didn't have Apollo Creed who died in 4 which was stupid! Carl Weathers was Rocky's best nemesis and I think Rocky V would have rocked if Apollo and Rocky had to step back into the ring and battle each other. So much for wishful thinking.Meredith Burgess didn't die until 1997 so why he was killed off in Rocky 3 I have no idea! The lost of Mickey and Apollo is when Rocky should have ended forever.",3,There's An Unfair Bias Against This Movie!,1262390400,"01 2, 2010",2010,5070,"['believe', 'was', 'Sage', 'Stallone', 'age',

288977,A363QRXP83K8ZE,6301982746,"N. P. Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[5, 7]","I have to give it up for Rocky V.  It's one of the best bad movies ever made.The original Rocky was a likeable enough film, inspired by a real nobody who went the distance with Ali and lived to tell about it.After the success of Rocky, Stallone got real moviemaking power and went to work building one of the more lucrative and shameless franchises in Hollywood history.  Every button was pushed, every last drop was milked from the formula, and then some.While Rocky would have died after Rocky II (if not after the original beating), he somehow lived to survive the train wreck beating of Rocky IV, where 'the Russian' (played by a Swede) pounds Rocky into hamburger and still loses.Rocky V picks up right after Rocky IV.  The Rock has brain damage (finally), and before you know it, he's broke and moves back to his old South Philly neighborhood with wife Adrian, his young son, and professional waste of life Paulie, who gave Rocky's millions to a shady accountant.The result is a work of genius.  Not only is it bad, but it's entirely watchable.  Stallone has that unique ability to disregard his own absurdity and take it to the next level.  It's something that Steven Seagal, for example, tried to do, with some success.  Rocky was his creation, so it's entirely understandable that he would do his best to destroy that creation, and then some, all the while believing he was making a quality film.  While he once claimed that Rocky IV was the final Rocky film, he is now obsessed with making Rocky VI.As well he should.  Rocky V has our meathead hero training a new kid, played by Tommy the Duke Morrison.  Eventually, the Duke, or the Gunn, whatever his name is, is tempted by a shady promoter who is obviously Don King, and Rocky then has to play the role of Micky and Apollo, his previous mentors.  Oddly enough, the director is John G. Avildsen, who made the original Rocky film before Stallone's ego hijacked the franchise for years.There are plenty of cliches, plenty of brain-damanged wisdom, plenty of shameless flashbacks (so we can work in Micky and Duke, though Apollo had more shame than to appear, it seems) and of course, another end-bout, this one in the street as Rocky takes another beating but still manages to win, his brain now reduced to a brittled peanut, his body somehow still in one piece.The Rocky sequels have all been ridiculous ego trips for Stallone, but they've all been shamelessly entertaining, if completely, insanely unrealistic.  Rocky, remember, never learned how to block, and his head appears to be made of iron, literally.  Stallone has made a science out of making moronic, violent films.I can't commend Stallone enough for this one.  I don't see where else the series can go.  Perhaps Rocky can return for one more movie, now bound to a wheelchair, drooling as he imagines what might have happened had he lost to Apollo, Mr T, or Drago, who all have ripe cameo potential.",2,Tremendous TKO,1110240000,"03 8, 2005",2005,2921,"['have', 'give', 'up', 'Rocky', 'V.', 'one', 'best', 'bad', 'movies', 'ever', 'made.The', 'original', 'Rocky', 'was', 'likeable', 'enough', 'film', 'inspired', 'real', 'nobody', 'who', 'went', 'distance', 'Ali', 'lived', 'tell', 'it.After', 'success', 'Rocky', 'Stallone', 'got', 'real', 'moviemaking', 'power', 'went', 'work', 'building', 'one', 'more', 'lucrative', 'shameless', 'franchises', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'Every', 'button', 'was', 'pushed', 'last', 'drop', 'was', 'milked', 'formula', 'then', 'some.While', 'Rocky', 'would', 'have', 'died', 'Rocky', 'II', 'not', 'original', 'beating', 'somehow', 'lived', 'survive', 'train', 'wreck', 'beating', 'Rocky', 'IV', 'where', ""'the"", 'Russian', 'played', 'Swede', 'Rocky', 'hamburger', 'still', 'loses.Rocky', 'V', 'up', 'right', 'Rocky', 'IV', 'Rock', 'brain', 'damage', 'finally', 'know', 'broke', 'back', 'old', 'South', 'Philly', 'neighborhood', 'wife', 'Adrian', 'young', 'son', 'professional', 'waste', 'life', 'Paulie', 'who', 'gave', 'Rocky', 'millions', 'shady', 'accountant.The', 'result', 'work', 'genius', 'Not', 'only', 'bad', 'entirely', 'watchable', 'Stallone', 'unique', 'ability', 'disregard', 'own', 'absurdity', 'take', 'next', 'level', 'something', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'example', 'tried', 'do', 'success', 'Rocky', 'was', 'creation', 'entirely', 'understandable', 'would', 'do', 'best', 'destroy', 'creation', 'then', 'while', 'believing', 'was', 'making', 'quality', 'film', 'once', 'claimed', 'Rocky', 'IV', 'was', 'final', 'Rocky', 'film', 'now', 'obsessed', 'making', 'Rocky', 'VI.As', 'well', 'should', 'Rocky', 'V', 'meathead', 'hero', 'training', 'new', 'kid', 'played', 'Tommy', 'Duke', 'Morrison', 'Eventually', 'Duke', 'Gunn', 'name', 'tempted', 'shady', 'promoter', 'who', 'obviously', 'Don', 'King', 'Rocky', 'then', 'play', 'role', 'Micky', 'Apollo', 'previous', 'mentors', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'director', 'John', 'G.', 'Avildsen', 'who', 'made', 'original', 'Rocky', 'film', 'Stallone', 'ego', 'hijacked', 'franchise', 'are', 'plenty', 'cliches', 'plenty', 'brain-damanged', 'wisdom', 'plenty', 'shameless', 'flashbacks', 'can', 'work', 'Micky', 'Duke', 'Apollo', 'had', 'more', 'shame', 'appear', 'course', 'end-bout', 'one', 'street', 'Rocky', 'beating', 'still', 'win', 'brain', 'now', 'reduced', 'brittled', 'peanut', 'body', 'somehow', 'still', 'one', 'piece.The', 'Rocky', 'sequels', 'have', 'been', 'ridiculous', 'ego', 'trips', 'Stallone', ""'ve"", 'been', 'shamelessly', 'entertaining', 'completely', 'insanely', 'unrealistic', 'Rocky', 'remember', 'never', 'learned', 'how', 'block', 'head', 'be', 'made', 'iron', 'literally', 'Stallone', 'made', 'science', 'making', 'moronic', 'violent', 'films.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'commend', 'Stallone', 'enough', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'where', 'else', 'series', 'can', 'go', 'Perhaps', 'Rocky', 'can', 'return', 'one', 'more', 'movie', 'now', 'wheelchair', 'drooling', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'happened', 'had', 'lost', 'Apollo', 'Mr', 'T', 'Drago', 'who', 'have', 'ripe', 'cameo', 'potential']",Rocky 5 VHS

288981,AQGS7O75TKO3Z,6301982746,Pipkim,"[2, 4]","I sat up late last night watching this movie and I have to agree with most that this was the weakest of the Rocky movies in terms of plot and plausibility. The Rocky of the first four movies, who despite his lack of education and slow exterior, is far from stupid and rather shrewd in reading people (except maybe his brother in law Paulie). In this movie, Rocky makes departures from character that brain damage can't explain. It's hard to believe that Rock wouldn't see through a violent upstart like Tommy, trust alcoholic Paulie to be in charge of his finances at all in the first place, or be that distant from his son (though of course he doesn't realize he is at all in his zeal to develop his own version of Mini-Me). And that street fight was just corny.However, what saved this movie for me was the interaction between Rocky and ""the kid"" because it was played by a real life father and son. Sly and Sage didn't have to act those scenes-those tender shows of affection (mostly on Rocky's part), and Rocky's heartfelt plea to assure his son of his wish to keep the ""home team"" intact, were absolutely genuine, and made the movie worthwhile to me (of course, I love sappy stuff like that).I'm only sorry Sage didn't return for Rocky 6...",3,Father-son bonding saved this,1175904000,"04 7, 2007",2007,1245,"['sat', 'up', 'late', 'last', 'night', 'watching', 'movie', 'have', 'agree', 'most', 'was', 'weakest', 'Rocky', 'movies', 'terms', 'plot', 'plausibility', 'Rocky', 'first', 'four', 'movies', 'who', 'lack', 'education', 'slow', 'exterior', 'far', 'stupid', 'rather', 'shrewd', 'reading', 'people', 'maybe', 'brother', 'law', 'Paulie', 'movie', 'Rocky', 'departures', 'character', 'brain', 'damage', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'hard', 'believe', 'Rock', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', 'violent', 'upstart', 'Tommy', 'trust', 'alcoholic', 'Paulie', 'be', 'charge', 'finances', 'first', 'place', 'be', 'distant', 'son', 'course', ""n't"", 'realize', 'zeal', 'develop', 'own', 'version', 'Mini-Me', 'street', 'fight', 'was', 'just', 'corny.However', 'what', 'saved', 'movie', 'was', 'interaction', 'Rocky', 'kid', 'was', 'played', 'real', 'life', 'father', 'son', 'Sly', 'Sage', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'act', 'scenes-those', 'tender', 'shows', 'affection', 'mostly', 'Rocky', 'part', 'Rocky', 'heartfelt', 'plea', 'assure', 'son', 'wish', 'keep', 'home', 'team', 'intact', 'were', 'absolutely', 'genuine', 'made', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'course', 'love', 'sappy', 'stuff', '.I', ""'m"", 'only', 'sorry', 'Sage', 'did', ""n't"", 'return', 'Rocky', '6']",Rocky 5 VHS
288982,ACMAUJEBY6GJF,6301982746,Pl Amundsen,"[0, 1]","I just bought the ""Rocky-box-edition"" (including all the five movies) and to be honest I didn't expect much. I bought it first of all because of the masterpiece of the first movie, a moving and oscar-worthy performance of the entire cast. The chemistry is to be touched between the actors, and ""Rocky"" has to be one of the best movies of the 70's. It's not mindless action, it's far more drama than it is action -and it has a fantastic story to tell. It contains more documentary than it dwells on sentimentality, and still the character-development is so overwhelming. Rocky Balboa, the boxer with a heart of gold -and he's a character you'd have a heart of stone not to like. I'm lost for words here, but let's put it this way; This movie (including its' five followers, perhaps with Rocky 4 as an exception..?) is unlike anything else Sylvester Stallone has ever done. And I think it's sad the way Stallone has wasted his talent on shallow-action-movies in the later years of his carrier. ""Rocky"" is the main proof of that Stallone is far more than muscles, this is a movie to take serious, and yes, it's deep.Back to this final Rocky (so far). It was something moral and far overdone about Rock 4, however entertaining it somehow crossed the line where the previous movies had managed to be ""the real thing"". As in realistic to some level. And they perfectly matched eachother. Rocky 4 was Van Damme-material, which could have been ok if it hadn't been for that it didn't fit in anywhere in the Rocky-collection. Now that it's made I'm glad it's added to the box, but it's the weakest of the five. It doesn't contain the same inspirating storytelling, and unlike the others (including the fifth) it's in the typicall ""sequel""-category. However entertaining it may be as mentioned. It contains good music as a plus.Well, let's try again; With the same director of Rocky (the first) behind the wheels the spirit is back. Rocky is back! You might as well've skipped the fourth. It again gives a perspective of the chynical sports-business, and the subject is betrayal. And also the bound of family, and the things that really matters in life. All amazingly done, and the saga is somehow completed -without a final match in the ring which could have been too silly. The balance between reality and entertainment is back, and the movie is a joy to watch.Incredible for a number five!(Correction; Rocky 3 is the weakest of the five, I hadn't seen it before I wrote this review a couple of days ago, and now that it's done - I must say I didn't think it could be worse than Rocky 4, but I am sorry to say it is.

Also I felt that the last photo of Rocky at the end of Rocky IV with the American flag behind him was the monumental way to end the story as it represented the picture to remember Rocky by. To some extent I can see how there would need to be a Rocky V, but the way this movie came out wasn't the Rocky V I was imagining.After returning from Russia after his greatest triumph, Rocky returns to American realizes his millions has been stolen by his theif accountant. Rocky now has now been diagnosed with permanent brain damage from all those years of fighting (Ivan Drago a big reason). Rocky, Adrian, Rocky Jr (Sage Stallone) and Paulie are left broke and must return to the old low-rent neighborhood where they started out in Philadelphia. The only thing that Rocky can do now is take  over Mickey's Gym that was left to him in 1982 when Mickey died.Returning to Philadelphia, Rocky discovers a hungry young fighter named Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison). Rocky decides to manage Tommy and turn him into a the number-one contender. Along the way, Rocky now begins to neglect his family more and more causing more resentment by Rocky Jr against his father. After Tommy becomes the top contender, he betrays Rocky and decides to go with a unscrupolous promoter, Mr. George Washington Duke. Now that Tommy has become the new heavyweight champion, the fans and the press hound him for betraying Rocky. Duke convinces Tommy that to get respect, he must fight Rocky.I have to say, the final fight between Rocky and Tommy was pretty good due to the fact that it was a street fight this time. Rocky proves once again that even with brain damage, he can still finish on top.This movie had an okay plot, and the fight was good. But I do strongly feel that as a major Rocky fan, the series should have ended after Rocky IV or Rocky V should have been a lot better. In my opinion this was a shamless way to end four great movies. In a way the circle was completed in the process from bum to star to bum all over again. It is my least favorite of the 5 ""Rocky"" moveis but for those of you Rocky fans, buy this DVD to complete your Rocky collection and you may love or just like it. Either way, this movie is worth buying no doubt.",3,Shamless Way to End the Rocky Series...,1108166400,"02 12, 2005",2005,2390,"['though', 'greatest', 'victory', 'Rocky', 'life', 'Ivan', 'Drago', 'Rocky', 'IV', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'top', 'greatest', 'fighter', 'time', 'Also', 'felt', 'last', 'photo', 'Rocky', 'end', 'Rocky', 'IV', 'American', 'flag', 'was', 'monumental', 'way', 'end', 'story', 'represented', 'picture', 'remember', 'Rocky', 'extent', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'need', 'be', 'Rocky', 'V', 'way', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'Rocky', 'V', 'was', 'imagining.After', 'returning', 'Russia', 'greatest', 'triumph', 'Rocky', 'American', 'realizes', 'millions', 'been', 'stolen', 'theif', 'accountant', 'Rocky', 'now', 'now', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'permanent', 'brain', 'damage', 'years', 'fighting', 'Ivan', 'Drago', 'big', 'reason', 'Rocky', 'Adrian', 'Rocky', 'Jr', 'Sage', 'Stallone', 'Paulie', 'are', 'left', 'broke', 'must', 'return', 'old', 'low-rent', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'started', 'out', 'Philadelphia', 'only', 'thing', 'Rocky', 'can', 'do', 'now', 'take', 'Mickey', 'Gym', 'was', 'left', '1982', 'when', 'Mickey', 'died.Returning', 'Philadelphia', 'Rocky', 'hungry', 'young', 'fighter', 'named', 'Tommy', 'Gunn', 'Tommy', 'Morrison', 'Rocky', 'manage', 'Tommy', 'turn', 'number-one', 'contender', 'way', 'Rocky', 'now', 'neglect', 'family', 'more', 'more', 'causing', 'more', 'resentment', 'Rocky', 'Jr', 'father', 'Tommy', 'top', 'contender', 'Rocky', 'decides', 'go', 'unscrupolous', 'promoter', 'Mr.', 'George', 'Washington', 'Duke', 'Now', 'Tommy', 'become', 'new', 'heavyweight', 'champion', 'fans', 'press', 'hound', 'betraying', 'Rocky', 'Duke', 'Tommy', 'get', 'respect', 'must', 'fight', 'Rocky.I', 'have', 'say', 'final', 'fight', 'Rocky', 'Tommy', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'due', 'fact', 'was', 'street', 'fight', 'time', 'Rocky', 'once', 'again', 'even', 'brain', 'damage', 'can', 'still', 'finish', 'top.This', 'movie', 'had', 'okay', 'plot', 'fight', 'was', 'good', 'do', 'strongly', 'feel', 'major', 'Rocky', 'fan', 'series', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'Rocky', 'IV', 'Rocky', 'V', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'opinion', 'was', 'shamless', 'way', 'end', 'four', 'great', 'movies', 'way', 'circle', 'was', 'completed', 'process', 'bum', 'star', 'bum', 'over', 'again', 'least', 'favorite', '5', 'Rocky', 'moveis', 'Rocky', 'fans', 'buy', 'DVD', 'complete', 'Rocky', 'collection', 'may', 'love', 'just', 'way', 'movie', 'worth', 'buying', 'doubt']",Rocky 5 VHS

If you've watched the ROCKY series and truly understood it, then V's story makes sense in a linear way. The character of Rocky Balboa has come full circle, from bum to star to bum. Rocky's older now, and the boxing game is much different. After losing his riches to a crooked accountant, losing brain cells to years of repeated beatings (most notably by Ivan Drago in IV), and losing respect by a Don King-like promoter, Rocky feels every bit the loser he did back in the original ROCKY. He tries to continue living his boxing career vicariously through a new protege, with disastrous results. And although his boxing career is over, Rocky still proves he is the best there is at what he does (ala Wolverine) by returning to his street-fighting roots. Without giving away the ending of the movie, the point is that Rocky has his family, and the rest of life's troubles mean nothing when up against that fact.So it was a well-written movie, but I personally didn't care for it all that much. Right off the bat, I hate it when the good guys get screwed. I don't mind seeing Rocky beat up, for whatever reason, but it really gets to me that after five films, he winds up in the gutter again, despite it being done realistically. Also, the soundtrack to the movie sucked big time. Rap music? For Pete's sake, what happened to &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot;? What happened to Vince DiCola? And the climactic street fight wasn't corepgraphed well, I thought. It went on too long, and Rocky took beatings in thew wrong parts. When you hear that triumphant Rocky theme start to play (even if only fort a few seconds), you expect that fight to be over a few seconds later. Instead, every time it looked like Rocky won, his opponent kept jumping up like the killer in a slasher flick. And call me a sap, but I prefer an ending where the hero wins big, rather than just survives.So, while not a great ending, it is at least a definite and plausible ending. ROCKY V may be the worst of the series, but it's still ok, and worth a viewing at least once for closure's sake. Go ahead and get the collection, you'll get 3 great movies, and two okay ones.Fun fact: in a &quot;rare&quot; display of Hollywood nepotism, we find that Stallone's son can actually act. Although I will never figure out how that character manages to age so quickly. In III, he looked about 7. IV took place the day after, and he looked to be about 10. V took place soon after IV, and now he's about 14.

With the now annoying nagging of Adrian, Rocky decides to retire once and for all. To make matters worse for the poor old slugger, he goes bankrupt after his accountant runs off with his fortunes.Rocky returns to the streets of Philly where he takes over Mickey's old gym. There he meets a young Oklahoma fighter named Tommy Gunn. Rocky sees a conviction in the kid and decides to take him into his home and train him to become the next champ.Cut to the chase, a loud mouthed boxing promoter named Duke, played by Richard Gant, who is a carbon copy of Don king but without the hairdo, lures young Tommy with cash and fortune and a chance at the title, something he failed to do with the stubborn and honest Rocky. Duke has plans however, and that is to bring Rocky back into the ring and the way to do that is to turn his protege against him for a fight of a lifetime (Old lion against Young lion).The movie focuses on the corruption of the boxing commission, and Rocky's family problems: Rocky's preoccupation with Tommy leaves his son Rocky Jr, played by Stallone's real life son Sage, having to learn how to cope with street life alone, causing a near family breakup.The movie succeeds in bringing back the grit and realism of the original Rocky thanks to the return of John G.

288996,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,6301982746,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[2, 2]","I love Rocky 5 and I'm not afraid to admit it!  This movie has been dumped on for years by critics and fans, but I feel that's all rather harsh.  It may not be the best film, but it's nowhere near as bad as it's reputation makes it out to be.  When you talk to someone about the Rocky series, people always tend to like them all ""except for Part 5, that was stupid"".  So where did all this hatred come from?  Could be a number of things, but I think it has a lot to do with the number 5.  When you get to the point of having a 5 slapped on after the film's title, it's usually not a good thing.  Part 5s are reserved for Friday The 13s, Nightmare On Elm Streets and Police Academys, not Rocky movies.  I think the film may have been conceived as a joke before many folks even saw it, especially since Rocky 4, while an entertaining movie, started delving into the ridiculous.  And I think most people went into this film while in the mindset of, ""this is a bad movie"".  Maybe it just wasn't the right time and people weren't wanting another Rocky film.But when you think about it, it's actually a good movie, kind of a downer, but life can certainly be a downer, even in Rockyland.  It's a little more down to earth.  Rocky loses his money and is forced to move back to his old neighborhood.  Brain damage from the fight with Drago has now made it so he can't fight anymore, yet he's constantly harassed by boxing promoter George Washington Duke(a thinly disguised portrayal of Don King) to make a big comeback in a fight with the #1 contender.  Adrian returns to her old job and Rocky reopens Mickey's gym.  Young boxer Tommy Gunn befriends Rocky looking for his big shot at becoming a pro.  Rocky agrees to manage and train him, thus shunning his son who is trying hard to adjust to this different lifestyle.  Family conflicts galore!!  Then the slimy Duke, still trying to get Rocky into the ring, gets his claws into Tommy.  Tommy gets a taste of money and success and soon becomes sick of being referred to as Rocky's ""robot"", and decides to earn his respect by pushing Rocky to fight.  Of course we all know that it all ends in a cool street brawl.This film strayed from the formula of the last two films.  It now put Rocky in the role of Mickey training a hungry young boxer like he once was.  Rocky acts more like Rocky in this film.  We all noticed that after part 2, Rocky's personality changed.  He wasn't the childlike, slightly punchy and lovable dope anymore, but seemed like the kind of character Stallone played a lot of in the 80s.  It's nice to see Rocky in his old clothes and hat acting like Rocky(he even starts smoking again!), even if it doesn't really make sense why he went from upper class hoity toity back to how he was before.One flaw I certainly found in this film was the character of Tommy Gunn, or maybe it's real life boxer Tommy Morrison's performance.  You're supposed to like him in the beginning and view him as a kind of second generation Rocky, but you never like the guy.  I certainly didn't anyhow.  He never comes across as a very likable or sympathetic character, even when telling a sob story about an abusive father.  Gunn's a necessary character to the story, but a lousy one(but again, that could just be Morrison's performance).Often(always)overlooked is the performance of Richard Gant who plays the evil G. W. Duke.  This guy has got the fast talking, hustling schtick of Don King down awesomely.  He's easily one of the best aspects of the movie.  When ever I see Gant in other films, I immediately think, ""Hey!  It's Duke!""I tend to hear people whine about Rocky's son, played by Sly's real life son, Sage Stallone.  A lot of folks think he's annoying, but I don't have a problem with him.  Sage grew up to start the company Grindhouse Releasing.  So look at it this way, Sage is the reason we have Cannibal Holocaust on DVD here in the states, so I think the entire U.S. should owe a debt of gratitude.So in the end I'm basically saying that Rocky 5 has always been unfairly labeled as a dreadful film.  I never said it was a great film(I just said I loved it), but if you feel particularly ballsy, you might want to catch it again.  You might...just might...be surprised.",4,"Watch It, You S.O.B!!

But being a huge fan, there really is no way I can give this a bad review.I will admit the film does seem out of place a little bit. In the previous movies, Rocky speaks with great grammar most of the time, now he is back to his bumbling terrible grammar ways again. But of course that could have been the result of taking one too many hits to the head in the previous movie.I can see where other Rocky fans would dislike this movie because Rocky doesn't go back into the ring and it doesn't have the vintage Rocky story to it. Plus the soundtrack just seemed out place the majority of the time.But let's face it, when one is watching this film, you can easily tell that it is a movie about the hardships of boxing. The other four movies were mainly perspective on one's hardships in life from a bum to champion of the world. None of them seem to have captured the true hardships of boxing itself as a career.

Rocky & the Balboa family move back into the old Phillie neighborhood that they fought their out of all those years ago.Things get grim when Rocky finds out he has irreversible brain damage, meaning that one more fight could kill him.Whats even worse is a scruplous fight promoter, George Washington Duke, hounding Rocky trying to get him back into the ring, for a mighty payday no matter what the cost to Rocky's life.A small glimmer of hope for Rocky turns up in the form of Tommy Gunn, a promising young fighter who is a big fan of ""The Italian Stallion"". Rocky decides to take the young fighter under his wing and train him much the same way Mickey trained him. But, as Tommy gets better & heads up to the top of the rankings, fans & the media nickname Tommy, ""Rocky's Shadow"", a nickname that Tommy doesn't take kindly to.Whats worse is that George Washington Duke is slowly moving in and steering Tommy into his direction, enticing the kid with money, cars, women, etc. Things that Rocky couldn't give the kid. Tommy signs a contract, practically ditching Rocky.But, the one thing Tommy doesn't have, & wants more than anything else, is respect and Tommy has none of it. Its up to Rocky to teach the kid a lesson & know his role.""Rocky V"" is easily the weakest link in the saga. It trys to capture the spirit of the earlier films, but, somehow doesn't quite grasp it. The problem here is in the first 2 films viewers watched Rocky as a hungry fighter going the distance, twice, and beating the odds, while, in this film it just seems like a been there, done that attitude blankets the film.It does suck to see Rocky lose it all & move back into a place that he thought he would never have to go back to.The fight at the end is o.k., at best (again, I would rate it dead last in the saga, as far as the fights go). When I first realized this was the big fight of the movie, it really was a dissapointment (no training montage?! no ""eye of the tiger""!?!)""Rocky V"" is a decent enough movie, but, I always thought the saga should've gone out with a bang, than a whimper.As for ""Rocky VI"", its highly likely that it will ever hit the big screen (""V"" was released 15 years ago). There is a script treatment that is worth checking out in Stallone's own magazine titled ""Sly"".In the script an aging Rocky realizes that nothing lasts forever. Its been roughly five years since the death of Adrian, Paulie finally gets a girlfriend and moves in with her, Rocky Jr. has grown up & become a busy businessman & for the first time in a long while Rocky is all alone. But, when the current heavyweight champ is dissed on a ESPN style cableshow, in which a daily feature has a current sportstar going up against a sportslegend of the same sport (its all CGI & computer enhanced), in this case, he went up against Rocky & lost badly, he calls Rocky out of retirement to see if he still has The Eye Of The Tiger.Not bad.

289007,AP3B615GM191G,6301982746,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","The legend of Rocky Balboa grew out of the harsh streets of Philadelphia, and in this ""final"" (at the time) installment, that is exactly the place where the tale winds down.For a basic plot summary, ""Rocky V"" finds the title character (Sylvester Stallone) having sustained irreversible brain damage after the Drago fight and thus forced into retirement.  When Paulie (Burt Young) makes a financial snaffu, the Balboa family loses their fortune and must return to their old living quarters in Philly.  While there, Rocky begins training a young, hungry fighter named Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison), while Rocky Jr. (Sage Stallone) struggled to cope with his new environment.Likely due to a change in direction (Stallone hands the reins back to John Avildson), this film is more like the original than any of the other sequels, from the tone of the drama to the actual locations.  This turns out to be a smart move for the franchise, as it allows for a bit of closure (coming full circle) to the overall narrative.  It never ceases to amaze me that Stallone was able to keep the Rocky Balboa character so fresh, considering how most of his other film ""icons"" are anything but.There are two very hokey situations that you must first get over in order to enjoy this movie:1. The aging of Rocky Jr.  When Rocky leaves for Russia in the fourth film, his son isn't more than 8-9 years old.  When Rocky comes back, still sporting the bruises from Drago, his kid is in roughly late middle school.  This is a huge continuity issue in order to make other portions of the movie make sense dramatically.2. Paulie losing all of Rocky's money.  Couldn't director Avildson have come up with anything better than that for why the Balboa's have to move back to Philadelphia?If you can put those concerns in the rear view mirror, though, than there are plenty of themes/moments in this film that will entertain you:-The Don King clone, which was (is?!) a real issue in boxing during the 1980s and 90s.-The Rocky/Tommy relationship, which is fated for failure right from the get-go but still makes you feel for Rocky since he can no longer physically enter the ring.-The son angle.  Rocky tries to ""do for"" his family to make up for the lost fortune, but eventually realizes that all he needs to do is ""do with"" them in order to preserve the family unit.-A touching scene at the old gym in which Rocky reminisces about former trainer Mick (Burgess Meredith).  Perhaps the greatest single scene in the entire franchise.-Of course, what would a Rocky film be without a fight scene, but in this case it takes place on the streets, not within a squared circle.  The drama is palpable in those final minutes.To me, this film was a fitting end for the Rocky franchise (until, of course, it wasn't once Stallone resurrected the franchise this millennium).  A few things don't jive, but by-and-large it still provides the character development and high drama that the Rocky series has come to be known for.  For whatever reason, Sly Stallone himself has pretty much stricken this movie from the Rocky ""anthology"" because of his deep hatred for it, but I don't see the reasoning.
