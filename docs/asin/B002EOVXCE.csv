When this show is funny, however, it is REALLY funny.  I've shared the ""Man Cold"" sketch with a lot of people!  Please be aware that a lot of the humor is deliberately vulgar, and sometimes violent; this is not a show to share with young children.",4,"Overall, well worth the price",1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,415,"['BBC', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'found', 'sketches', 'primarily', 'rely', 'British', 'sense', 'propriety', 'humor', 'fell', 'flat', 'When', 'show', 'funny', 'however', 'REALLY', 'funny', ""'ve"", 'shared', 'Man', 'Cold', 'sketch', 'lot', 'people', 'Please', 'be', 'aware', 'lot', 'humor', 'deliberately', 'vulgar', 'sometimes', 'violent', 'not', 'show', 'share', 'young', 'children']",Man Stroke Woman: The Complete Series
1265569,ATZONTF6SUZEP,B002EOVXCE,Matthew Patton,"[10, 10]","There are moments of sublime idiocy in this series that leave you wondering how the sexes EVER get together--others that leave you wondering how we, as a species, manage to get out of bed in the morning, tie our shoes, much less go out and earn our daily bread . . .From the slacker who casually informs his ex-girlfriend that he's now the King of Spain (he's got a business card that says so -- see?) to the lady whose wardrobe choices leave her husband gasping, to that MINOR incident of cannibalism, these sketches will often leave you gasping for breath, limp with laughter, and more than once with your jaw on the floor.God knows the cast helps -- to most Americans, Nick Frost will be the most familiar name, but by the time you finish the second disc, you will have become a firm fan of his colleagues here; Nick Burns, Meredith McNeill, Amanda Abbington, and the wonderful double act of Daisy Haggard and Ben Crompton, whose timing and inflections are truly exquisite.Another great extra here are the episode commentaries -- sometimes to the point, more than once wandering off onto tangents.  At some point or another, the entire cast, as well as director Ric Cantor and the series producer Ash Atalla, participate, and their sometimes-prickly, often riotous interaction demonstrates that the hilarity of this show was no fluke -- this is the work of seriously funny people . . .",5,"""You said there'd be girls here . . .""",1277078400,"06 21, 2010",2010,1388,"['are', 'moments', 'sublime', 'idiocy', 'series', 'leave', 'wondering', 'how', 'sexes', 'EVER', 'get', 'together', 'others', 'leave', 'wondering', 'how', 'species', 'manage', 'get', 'bed', 'morning', 'tie', 'shoes', 'much', 'less', 'go', 'out', 'earn', 'daily', 'bread', 'slacker', 'who', 'casually', 'ex-girlfriend', 'now', 'King', 'Spain', 'got', 'business', 'card', 'so', 'see', 'lady', 'wardrobe', 'choices', 'leave', 'husband', 'gasping', 'MINOR', 'incident', 'cannibalism', 'sketches', 'will', 'often', 'leave', 'gasping', 'breath', 'limp', 'laughter', 'more', 'once', 'jaw', 'floor.God', 'cast', 'most', 'Americans', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'will', 'be', 'most', 'familiar', 'name', 'time', 'finish', 'second', 'disc', 'will', 'have', 'become', 'firm', 'fan', 'colleagues', 'here', 'Nick', 'Burns', 'Meredith', 'McNeill', 'Amanda', 'Abbington', 'wonderful', 'double', 'act', 'Daisy', 'Haggard', 'Ben', 'Crompton', 'timing', 'inflections', 'are', 'truly', 'exquisite.Another', 'great', 'extra', 'here', 'are', 'episode', 'commentaries', 'sometimes', 'point', 'more', 'once', 'wandering', 'off', 'tangents', 'point', 'entire', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'director', 'Ric', 'Cantor', 'series', 'producer', 'Ash', 'Atalla', 'participate', 'sometimes-prickly', 'often', 'riotous', 'interaction', 'hilarity', 'show', 'was', 'fluke', 'work', 'seriously', 'funny', 'people']",Man Stroke Woman: The Complete Series
1265570,A2ZT6C7X6A07KP,B002EOVXCE,Q,"[0, 0]","This is one of the best British comedies I've seen, for my personal tastes at least. It's a bit dark, cruel, ironic, and smart. Its comedy lasts, I've often emailed skits to friends (exploding dog the most), and have had friends I've introduced this series to send me skits. This is Nick Frost at his best, though often, in my opinion, I've seen him mostly at his worst; don't get me wrong, he makes a great goofy yet often annoying side kick with Simon Peg, yet in this show, he stands on his own two, and stands very well (what does that mean?)Many of the other cast members, those who might not be too recognizable by name, are, however, recognizable by their many other appearances in other British comedies.I highly recommend this show.",5,"Britcom at its best, plus, no can laugher.",1317686400,"10 4, 2011",2011,741,"['one', 'best', 'British', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'personal', 'tastes', 'least', 'bit', 'dark', 'cruel', 'ironic', 'smart', 'comedy', 'lasts', ""'ve"", 'often', 'emailed', 'skits', 'friends', 'exploding', 'dog', 'most', 'have', 'had', 'friends', ""'ve"", 'introduced', 'series', 'send', 'skits', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'best', 'though', 'often', 'opinion', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'mostly', 'worst', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'great', 'goofy', 'yet', 'often', 'annoying', 'side', 'kick', 'Simon', 'Peg', 'yet', 'show', 'own', 'two', 'very', 'well', 'what', 'mean', 'Many', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'recognizable', 'name', 'are', 'however', 'recognizable', 'many', 'other', 'appearances', 'other', 'British', 'comedies.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show']",Man Stroke Woman: The Complete Series
