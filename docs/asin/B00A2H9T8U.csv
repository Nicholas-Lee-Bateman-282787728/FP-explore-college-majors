We will always have Jack Kerouac's novel, On The Road, that sent one, maybe two generations, on the road, on the road to some mystical discovery thing, some search for language to explain our short existence, to make sense of thing in the modern world that has no time for reflection on the big cosmic questions.We will always have Kerouac's finely wrought be-bop word plays jumping off the page out in the desolate 1950s a chicken in every pot and two cars (if not three) cars in every garage, in every suburban ranch house sub-division garage. We will always have Sal (a.k.a Jeanbon Kerouac) and Dean, Dean Moriarty (a.k.a. Neal Cassady), the father we did not know, could not know, while we were sitting on those Jersey shores, sweating out in those Ames cornfields, hell, even sitting on the seawall down in those old Hullsville beach fronts looking for the great blue-pink great Amercian West night.We will always have Charlie, Sonny, Slim, Big Red, the Duke, blowing out, trying to reach and sometimes making it, that high white, after hours, after the paying customers, the carriage trade, went home to bed and they blew to heaven, or tried to, with the boys, with the guys who knew when that note floated out some funky cellar bar door winding its way down to the harbor.We will always have Sal, Carlos, Bull, Dean and an ever changing assortment of , well, women, women, mainly, at their beck and call, riding, car-riding, riding hard over the hill and dale of this continent searching, well, just searching okay. We will always have the lost brothers, Sal and Dean, playing off of each other's strengths (and weaknesses) as they try to make sense of their world, or if not sense then to keep high, keep moving, and keep listening. And we will always have a great American novel to pass on to the next wanderlust generation, if there is another wanderlust generation.And that is exactly what is wrong with this long time in the making film adaptation of Kerouac's cultural coming- of- age novel. I looked forward with great anticipation to the film, and came away with fair- sized disappointment. Not with the main actors, Sam Riley, Garret Hedlund and Kristie Stewart since they were confined by the constricts of the way the director (and screen-writers) wanted to play the novel. Take away the drugs, sex, rock and roll (oops, be-bop jazz), and, oh yah, driving at high speed and/or hitchhiking, and there is no glue holding this thing together.Now no one can complain, or such complaints will go for naught after watching this film, that Kerouac was, frankly very oblique in his sexual references, and certainly in the amount of time he spent on discussing the ins and out of sex in the novel so it was quite disconcerting to find so much time spent on the sex scenes. Moreover, let's face it women for the men, and it was mainly men, of the Beat generation women were ornaments, or drudges and while it does no good to project today's mores backward they were kept around because as Dean/Neal shouted out one time ""I love women."" End of story.While Road is not strictly a buddy film I came out of the watching the film thinking that maybe, just, maybe it is impossible to put the novel in cinematic form, there is perhaps too much stream of consciousness, too much introspection, too much angst to corral on film.

1604406,A1KE3JBO3KQX2O,B00A2H9T8U,Brian C.,"[5, 6]","I should start by saying that the novel On the Road is a novel that presents serious challenges to anyone hoping to make it into a movie. There is probably a reason that this is the first (as far as I know) attempt to make the book into a movie. The book is not structured by a traditional plot: central conflict, climax, resolution. The book is about four separate journeys, the frantic search of a group of young writers, poets, and petty criminals for ""it"", some unachievable ideal. It would be very difficult to turn all of that into a coherent film so I was prepared for some pretty radical departures from the book. I was not disappointed in that regard, there were major deviations, but I do not think they were ultimately all that successful in turning the book into a coherent or interesting movie.The movie opens with some truly cringe worthy scenes of Carlo Marx (Ginsberg) reading some god-awful poetry and a heart to heart talk between Sal and Dean about their fathers, a scene that was entirely made up. Virtually every made up scene in the movie was cringe worthy to me. Whoever wrote the adaptation was clearly trying to ape Kerouac's style, which, admittedly would be difficult for anyone, but they were not really very successful. I also do not think that the soundtrack worked all that well. They had a good idea: use jazz. Jazz plays a big role in the book. Ultimately, I don't think it worked. There were scenes that I think would have been more powerful if they had been differently scored.I could also tell right away that there was not going to be any of the frantic energy of the book. They try, but again, they do not succeed. They also fail with most of the characters. Dean has none of the charisma and frantic energy that he has in the book. It is impossible to imagine why anyone would follow Dean, or put up with his non-sense, from this movie. In the book, it is clear that, as horrible as Dean can be to the people around him, he has some mysterious quality that draws people to him. They fail, in my opinion, to capture that in this movie. He is not only a con-man, he is dull and boring. The only characters I thought the movie handled well were Carlo Marx and Old Bull Lee (Ginsberg and Burroughs). All the other characters seemed flat and boring to me (MaryLou was on the border of interesting, maybe crossing it in a few moments).The movie also feels like it is just a bunch of fragmented scenes that do not really add up to a movie. I knew they were going to have to take a lot of license with the book but, if you are going to deviate as much as they did, they might as well put in a story, turn it into something coherent. They add a bunch of stuff that does not really add much to the overall story (like Carlo's homosexual relationship with Dean which, as far as I know, is historically accurate, but was not emphasized in the book). Carlo's relationship with Dean is just an isolated episode. So why take the license if it is not adding anything? There were a number of scenes that were totally made up that, in my opinion, had no purpose. Even the scenes that were taken directly from the book were not that interesting or powerful. I almost quit watching the movie out of boredom and I sort of drifted in and out for the last forty-five minutes or so.The preview of this movie really made it look good. It looked like they had captured the spirit, if not the letter, of the book, but, I think, in this case, unfortunately, looks were deceiving.",2,"Nope, not quite...",1377648000,"08 28, 2013",2013,3490,"['should', 'start', 'saying', 'novel', 'Road', 'novel', 'serious', 'challenges', 'anyone', 'hoping', 'make', 'movie', 'probably', 'reason', 'first', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'attempt', 'make', 'book', 'movie', 'book', 'not', 'structured', 'traditional', 'plot', 'central', 'conflict', 'climax', 'resolution', 'book', 'four', 'separate', 'journeys', 'frantic', 'search', 'group', 'young', 'writers', 'poets', 'petty', 'criminals', 'unachievable', 'ideal', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'turn', 'coherent', 'film', 'was', 'prepared', 'pretty', 'radical', 'departures', 'book', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'regard', 'were', 'major', 'deviations', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'were', 'ultimately', 'successful', 'turning', 'book', 'coherent', 'interesting', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'truly', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'scenes', 'Carlo', 'Marx', 'Ginsberg', 'reading', 'god-awful', 'poetry', 'heart', 'heart', 'talk', 'Sal', 'Dean', 'fathers', 'scene', 'was', 'entirely', 'made', 'up', 'Virtually', 'made', 'up', 'scene', 'movie', 'was', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'Whoever', 'wrote', 'adaptation', 'was', 'clearly', 'trying', 'ape', 'Kerouac', 'style', 'admittedly', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'anyone', 'were', 'not', 'really', 'very', 'successful', 'also', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'soundtrack', 'worked', 'well', 'had', 'good', 'idea', 'use', 'jazz', 'Jazz', 'big', 'role', 'book', 'Ultimately', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'worked', 'were', 'scenes', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'powerful', 'had', 'been', 'differently', 'scored.I', 'could', 'also', 'tell', 'right', 'away', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'frantic', 'energy', 'book', 'try', 'again', 'do', 'not', 'succeed', 'also', 'fail', 'most', 'characters', 'Dean', 'none', 'charisma', 'frantic', 'energy', 'book', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'follow', 'Dean', 'put', 'up', 'non-sense', 'movie', 'book', 'clear', 'that', 'as', 'horrible', 'Dean', 'can', 'be', 'people', 'mysterious', 'quality', 'people', 'fail', 'opinion', 'capture', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'con-man', 'dull', 'boring', 'only', 'characters', 'thought', 'movie', 'handled', 'well', 'were', 'Carlo', 'Marx', 'Old', 'Bull', 'Lee', 'Ginsberg', 'Burroughs', 'other', 'characters', 'seemed', 'flat', 'boring', 'MaryLou', 'was', 'border', 'interesting', 'maybe', 'crossing', 'few', 'moments', '.The', 'movie', 'also', 'just', 'bunch', 'fragmented', 'scenes', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'add', 'up', 'movie', 'knew', 'were', 'going', 'have', 'take', 'lot', 'license', 'book', 'are', 'going', 'deviate', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'put', 'story', 'turn', 'something', 'coherent', 'add', 'bunch', 'stuff', 'not', 'really', 'add', 'much', 'overall', 'story', 'Carlo', 'homosexual', 'relationship', 'Dean', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'historically', 'accurate', 'was', 'not', 'emphasized', 'book', 'Carlo', 'relationship', 'Dean', 'just', 'isolated', 'episode', 'why', 'take', 'license', 'not', 'adding', 'anything', 'were', 'number', 'scenes', 'were', 'totally', 'made', 'up', 'opinion', 'had', 'purpose', 'Even', 'scenes', 'were', 'taken', 'directly', 'book', 'were', 'not', 'interesting', 'powerful', 'almost', 'quit', 'watching', 'movie', 'boredom', 'sort', 'drifted', 'last', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'so.The', 'preview', 'movie', 'really', 'made', 'look', 'good', 'looked', 'had', 'captured', 'spirit', 'not', 'letter', 'book', 'think', 'case', 'unfortunately', 'looks', 'were', 'deceiving']",N/A

I usually watch a new movie from Amazon twice in two successive evenings. Most movies I watch five or more times. This movie I will watch only this one time. A good part was Kristen's acting.

I worked for the Southern Pacific for twenty-five years on the tracks. I know of no lonelier place than the tracks across New Mexico, Arizona and California. I may watch those last five minutes again sometime, but not the movie.The main problem with the movie is that it was promoted far too much with far to high expectations, and with far too many shots of Kristen.

The film really captures what it's like to be young and restless, but it would have been nice if the makers had found more to show us beyond all the scenes of Sal, Dean, and the others getting high and screwing. Sad thing is, this film had SO much potential and could have been something truly extraordinary with more character and plot development.The biggest problematical element, however, is this: As several others have noted, Kerouac aficionados are bound to be disappointed by how little this film actually follows the original novel. On the other hand, those who are not familiar with Kerouac and the other ""beats"" will probably be left wondering who these people are and wth the meaning of all this is supposed to be.All the same, aspiring writers will probably identify with everything ON THE ROAD shows us about the writing process.

1604413,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B00A2H9T8U,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[2, 5]","The first third of Walter Salles' film seems dedicated to amplifying the book's title, as we see all three protagonists quite literally on the road as they travel round the United States in the immediate post-war period.  Sometimes the shot-selection becomes a bit repetitive, with long point-of-view shots of the characters looking through the windscreen at the open road.As the narrative unfolds, so the movie develops thematically.  We discover the essential rootlessness of the characters; their search for something, even though they do know what that something is.  Hence their restlessness as they settle, but then feel the need to move on somewhere else.  The only stable aspect of their lives, it appears, is writing; the very act of setting pen to paper provides some kind of permanence in an otherwise evanescent existence.  The Kerouac-character discovers this, as we watch him recording his impressions on any scrap of paper he can find.Stylistically speaking, Salles' film owes a lot to earlier works, notably John Ford's THE GRAPES OF WRATH, EASY RIDER (the late Dennis Hopper, one of the stars of that film, receives a posthumous credit in ON THE ROAD), and BONNIE AND CLYDE.  It's a long film - perhaps a little too long - but it is very good at recapturing the moment of the late 1940s/ early 1950s, as three men go in search of their identities.

It  is a Whitmanesque song of independence and yearning for meaning and love and acceptance and Salles and Rivera, with considerable  assistance from the musical score by Gustavo Santaolalla and the cinematography of Eric Gautier.The young unfocused writer Sal Paradise/Jack Kerouac (Sam Riley)is joined by free-spirited Dean Moriarty/Neal Cassady (Garrett Hedlund in a magnificently realised portrayal) and his girl, Marylou/Luanne Henderson (Kristen Stewart) and Carlo Marx/Allen Ginsberg (Tom Sturridge)as they travel across the USA at breakneck speed, stopping in Denver and New York and other places trying to understand themselves and each other. They encounter a mix of people who each impact their journey indelibly: Old Bull Lee/William S. Burroughs  (Viggo Mortensen) and other less well known but important to the road trip played by such fine actors as Steve Buscemi, Amy Adams, Kirsten Dunst, Terrence Howard, Alice Braga, Elisabeth Moss, Danny Morgan and many more. The characters encounter and deal with drug abuse, sexual orgies, the entire spectrum of sexuality, marriage and children and divorce and above all the joys of freedom of place, of sex, of behavior, and of experiencing the kindness of strangers and the beauty of the countryside of America and Mexico. There is no true linear storyline and that will likely put off many viewers.But in the end this long film is about a period of time of global fear regarding post WW II side effects and changes in the art and writing and interrelating  that forever changed our world. The film is an experience and to appreciate it the viewer must just relinquish credibility and simply go on the road.

Francis Ford Coppola bought the film rights to the book decades ago and had long been searching for the right director to carry out his vision.  He thought he had found his man in Walter Salles after watching Motorcycle Diaries, but Walter appeared more comfortable on the road in South America than he did North America.  Of course, the book is much tougher to tackle, as there isn't a linear story despite that which the title implies.The result is a chronicle of a set of trips over a three-year period (1948-51) written as a stream of consciousness.  Salles would have been wiser to go with the scroll, which he shows in the end, instead of a rather conventional road movie that relies on way too many melodramatic devices.  Yet, Sam Riley, Garret Hedlund, Kristen Stewart, Tom Sturridge, Kirsten Dunst, and Viggo Mortensen all look the parts.  Too bad they couldn't fill out their roles.  Most of the scenes felt contrived.  That sense of wild abandonment that spurred Sal and Dean onward was missing.  Salles had Sal Paradise brooding way too much over his book, fastidiously scribbling notes along the way, while Dean more or less stumbled from one place to another unable to get out from under the shadow of his father.Viewers expect more after so many years in waiting, especially those who have read the book.  The scroll version came out a few years ago, which has the real names as opposed to the pen names that appear in the classic version of the book.  If Salles wanted the movie to feel like it came from the pages of Kerouac, he would have been wiser to have Jack sitting in front of his typewriter, loaded on benzedrine, as he furiously typed out the words over a fortnight after struggling so many years to get his words down on paper.  The scenes could have literally flown from the pages, to hell with a linear course of events.

This time we have an R-rated, two-hour (mumbled) talkathon.

(Yeah, that's probably not a word, but I don't care.)* Garrett Hedlund (""Country Strong"") as Dean Moriarty/Neal Cassady is a good-looking omni-sexual legend who isn't above doing a little hooking to earn a ride.* Kristen Stewart (""Snow White and the Huntsman"") as Marylou/LuAnne Henderson personifies one of the many women who are used and discarded like soiled tissues.* Amy Adams (""Trouble With the Curve"") as Jane/Joan Vollmer lives at one of the many stops along the way. At least she can give marital tips to an unhappy young bride.* Tom Surridge (""Waiting For Forever"") as Carlo Marx/Allen Ginsberg is a Beat poet and iconoclast, ultimately revered as the Grand Old Man of his generation. I'm afraid I was always too grounded to relate to his toked-up brand of philosophy.* Kirsten Dunst (""Melancholia"") as Camille/Caroline Cassady who at least has sense enough to kick the guy out.* Viggo Mortensen (""A Dangerous Method"") as Old Bull Lee/William S. Burroughs. Mortensen threatens to replace Sam Shepard as Hollywood's favorite grizzled curmudgeon.As you can see, this story that gives birth to a book was confusing, repugnant and endless (124 minutes), but I was impressed once again by Garrett Hedlund.

1604425,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B00A2H9T8U,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[3, 3]","Jack Kerouac's ""On the Road"" has been a Hollywood property since it was first published in 1957 with Marlon Brando in a lead role of the movie. Since then writers and directors have taken a crack at producing an ""On The Road"" film, but through the years the book has been judged as being ""unfilmable."" Francis Ford Coppola has been involved with ""On The Road"" since at least 1994 and there was great hope he could film the unfilmable, alas, I think ""On The Road"" remains unfilmable.When I first read Kerouac's ""On The Road"" it left me breathless. ""On The Road"" the movie doesn't, it misses the poetry of Kerouac's writing and vision of America despite the frequent voice over quoting passages from the book. Kerouac was a jazz writer, fast paced and improvisational like the jazz players he idolized, but the filmmakers chose to film a gritty almost noir version of ""On The Road."" Maybe the  filmmakers should have watched ""The Man with the Golden Arm,"" the soundtrack of which has the frenetic jazz pace and tone that would have matched Kerouac's style.Dean Moriarty was a fast talking conman, who could talk women into bed and the men into adventures in a car speeding across America. None of that comes through in Garret Hedlund's performance, instead of Benzedrine fueled speed (and they show the characters ingesting Benezdrine), Hedlund seems a slowed down barbituated Dean Moriarty. One of the attractions of Kerouac's ""On The Road"" is unbound joy and enthusiasm with which his characters attack life looking for the answers of existential questions in the search of experience and `kicks.'

1604429,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00A2H9T8U,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","By its very nature, Jack Kerouac's autobiographical ""On The Road"" is an episodic sojourn of self-discovery that doesn't really lend itself to the film medium. Since its publication in 1957, many have eyed the possibility of a big screen interpretation (and, indeed, several seventies road trip classics owe a debt to it), but the iconic book has never made it past the screenplay stage. Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather) has owned the rights to ""On The Road"" since 1980 and he's finally served up a version under the hand of director Walter Salles (he did the great Brazilian drama Central Station). Together, I'd say this handsome and well made film is both surprisingly faithful to the source material but also somewhat aloof from an emotional standpoint. Is it the book? Absolutely not. So those expecting a literal translation from page to screen will always have something to complain about. But for my money, the film does capture the spirit of this journey. At times riveting, at times perplexing, the movie is loaded with a veritable ""who's who"" from a casting standpoint. Amy Adams, Viggo Mortensen, Elizabeth Moss, and Kirsten Dunst, as some of the more recognizable names, all take relatively small parts in the overall picture. But the movie primarily focuses on a tangled romantic trio portrayed by Sam Riley, Garrett Hedlund, and Kristen Stewart.Sam Riley plays aspiring writer (and Kerouac stand-in) Sal Paradise. Living on the fringes of the artistic community, his existence is rocked by his introduction to the charming Dean Moriarty (Garrett Hedlund). He is fascinated by this free spirit and inspired by him. Moriarty represents the true freedom of America, open both emotionally and sexually to the experiences life has to offer. As they embark on a road trip across the country, they will share in love, drugs, and brushes with the law. Rebellion, adventure, freedom. All of the things needled to fuel Riley's creative spirit (he is journaling throughout) are provided on this odyssey. As I mentioned, it's all very episodic. Some of the encounters resonate more than others, but they all combine to form the bigger picture. As much as I wanted to feel connected to this story, however, I maintained somewhat of a distance. Riley, as the core of the picture, stays more of a voyeur even in the thick of things. His recitation of events is clinical and even detached. So, truthfully, I never got quite as close as I wanted.For me, ""On The Road"" is ultimately sold more on its performances than on its story. Sam Riley plays a solid lead. If you like him and you haven't seen his riveting work in 2007's ""Control,"" don't miss it. Stewart, also, makes the most of this change-of-pace role. Before becoming an international icon (for good or bad) in the Twilight franchise, the actress seemed content with indie work. It's good to see her get back to her roots. But the movie's success or failure hinges on the work of Hedlund. As Dean Moriarty, he is the catalyst and driving force behind almost all of the film's drama. You must believe he has the charm and charisma to enchant and frustrate almost every other character. And I thought he did. With a low key energy, he never overplays either. The relationship between Riley and Hedlund is the primary factor in this adaptation, and I think it is both fascinating and provocative. In the end, the movie wrapped this pivotal pairing up rather unsatisfactorily for my taste. I guess I never got close enough to Riley, never made a real emotional connection, so his evolution at the end of the picture felt both rushed and unexplained. Overall, though, I think ""On The Road"" is worth a look.

1604437,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00A2H9T8U,M. Oleson,"[4, 4]","Director Walter Salles (""Dark Water"") and screen writer Jose Rivera take Jack Kerouac's famous adventure and put it to film for what I believe is the first time.  Even with an all-star cast, they manage to bungle the trip much as Dean Moriarty (Garrett Hedlund) bungles his life.  Dean whose name is a substitute for the real life Neal Cassady is an ex-con, drugged out, alcoholic womanizer.  Sal Paradise (Sam Riley), subbing for Kerouac is a depressed writer whose father has just died.After meeting Dean in New York in 1947, Sal is immediately smitten by Dean's carefree attitude about life.  Dean returns to his hometown in Denver and invites Sal to visit.  Sal decides to do it, but with no money, no job, not much of a life he decides to hitchhike, taking odd jobs along the way.  When he eventually shows up, Dean has married girlfriend Marylou aka LuAnne Henderson played by Kristen Stewart.  Marylou is about as carefree as Dean and meets Sal while lounging mostly naked on the bed.  She is constantly flirting with whoever is around and Dean seems OK with it, even to the point of her being the trois to the boy's m&eacute;nage.Several characters come in and out of the trio's life including Carlo Marx/Allen Ginsberg (Tom Sturridge) who clearly has a romantic thing for Dean.  The problem with the film is that there is no cohesion or structure to the story.  Perhaps it was meant to be that way.  I've not read Kerouac's book so I can't comment on any common ground.  The film and the characters move around from New York to Denver to San Francisco to Maryland, back to New York then to New Orleans.  Everywhere they go, new characters appear, including those portrayed by Terrence Howard, Amy Adams, Alice Braga, Elisabeth Moss, Kirsten Dunst, Viggo Mortensen and others.  I was watching this with my son and he told me that the only reason he was sticking around is to see which famous actor will appear next for their few minutes on film.In one farcical scene, Sal and Dean are hitchhiking and are picked up by a credited ""Tall Thin Salesman"" played by Steve Buscemi.  ""Tall"" shows up at the guy's room with a bottle of whiskey and looking for action but not with a lady.  Sal's a bit disgusted, but Dean does the deed earning $20 for his trick.  Eventually, Sal has enough material to write his book and Dean looks like he's headed for an early grave.The performances are fine by all concerned.  The movie might be worth a look just to see Ms. Stewart give a strong performance after all those vampire movies.  She's good and you'll see her in a way you haven't before.  I can't recommend it otherwise.  It's just a mess.The Blu ray transfer is excellent however.  Salles was working again with Eric Gautier who he used with ""The Motorcycle Diaries.""  The film was shot on 35mm so you will see some grain in the transfer.  I loved the winter scenes and all of the cars from the late '40's and early '50's look great.  The 1080p resolution looks terrific in the wide 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The excellent DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is even better.  The film has an excellent musical soundtrack with plenty of jazz throughout thanks to composer Gustavo Santaolalla.  The surrounds are in play constantly.

1604438,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,B00A2H9T8U,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[5, 6]","Jack Kerouac's 1950's novel is brought to the screen courtesy of director Walter Salles who chronicled another road trip,The Motorcycle Diaries [Blu-ray]. It tells the story of Sal and his new friend Dean, who set out `on the road' to find themselves, resisting conformity in order to really understand their identity.  It's a journey involving drugs, alcohol and plenty of jazz, not to mention sex.. but ultimately for all the effective and beautiful cinematography and set design (what beautiful roads they are on..), and admittedly wonderful performances from Garret Hedlund in particular, this doesn't really go anywhere or tell us enough about either the times, the characters or the finding of the identity that is so central to the idea of the story, although there are intriguing moments along the way.In converting the novel to the screen, Salles has apparently relied heavily on the original prose particularly in the use of voice overs, without really coming up with a cinematic hook for how to tell this story to a modern audience.  If you decide to adapt a much loved novel, it stands to reason that you have a compelling vision for how it translates into a piece of cinema.  If it's just a love of the novel and a desire to bring it to the big screen - then this is what you end up with, a mumbling stream of eloquent but unengaging bohemian characters, aimlessly drifting but trying to learn about life in the process.  It seems to short change the book, given the novel's reputation.  At the very least it's all just a little too restrained and buttoned up to match the beat ethos.As a story intended to exemplify the values of the `beat generation', the movies success really depends on whose definition you use.  If you go by the critics who insist `beat' refers to beaten down, then this movie does portray that kind of bleakness.. however if you go by Kerouac's version of `beat' meaning beatific or blissful, the movie falls a long, long way short in convincing.  If the message is about promoting a stand against conformism, then it's failed in my opinion, because at no point do you really find yourself empathising with these characters, much less desiring of or appreciative of their values.  Can this really be the novel that inspired lifestyle and artistic choices for Bob Dylan, The Doors, Tom Waits and so many others? Alas no, it's a facsimile of it which, ironically, has lost its way.3/10",2,The road trip that goes nowhere,1369267200,"05 23, 2013",2013,2420,"['Jack', 'Kerouac', '1950', 'novel', 'brought', 'screen', 'courtesy', 'director', 'Walter', 'Salles', 'who', 'chronicled', 'road', 'trip', 'Motorcycle', 'Diaries', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'story', 'Sal', 'new', 'friend', 'Dean', 'who', 'set', 'out', 'road', 'find', 'resisting', 'conformity', 'order', 'really', 'understand', 'identity', 'journey', 'involving', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'plenty', 'jazz', 'not', 'mention', 'sex..', 'ultimately', 'effective', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'set', 'design', 'what', 'roads', 'are', 'on..', 'admittedly', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Garret', 'Hedlund', 'particular', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'tell', 'enough', 'times', 'characters', 'finding', 'identity', 'so', 'central', 'idea', 'story', 'are', 'intriguing', 'moments', 'way.In', 'converting', 'novel', 'screen', 'Salles', 'apparently', 'relied', 'heavily', 'original', 'prose', 'particularly', 'use', 'voice', 'overs', 'really', 'coming', 'up', 'cinematic', 'hook', 'how', 'tell', 'story', 'modern', 'audience', 'decide', 'adapt', 'much', 'loved', 'novel', 'reason', 'have', 'compelling', 'vision', 'how', 'piece', 'cinema', 'just', 'love', 'novel', 'desire', 'bring', 'big', 'screen', 'then', 'what', 'end', 'up', 'mumbling', 'stream', 'eloquent', 'unengaging', 'bohemian', 'characters', 'aimlessly', 'drifting', 'trying', 'learn', 'life', 'process', 'short', 'change', 'book', 'given', 'novel', 'reputation', 'very', 'least', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'restrained', 'buttoned', 'up', 'match', 'beat', 'story', 'intended', 'exemplify', 'values', 'beat', 'generation', 'movies', 'success', 'really', 'definition', 'use', 'go', 'critics', 'who', 'insist', 'beat', 'refers', 'beaten', 'down', 'then', 'movie', 'portray', 'kind', 'bleakness..', 'however', 'go', 'Kerouac', 'version', 'beat', 'meaning', 'beatific', 'blissful', 'movie', 'long', 'long', 'way', 'short', 'convincing', 'message', 'promoting', 'stand', 'conformism', 'then', 'failed', 'opinion', 'point', 'do', 'really', 'find', 'empathising', 'characters', 'much', 'less', 'desiring', 'appreciative', 'values', 'Can', 'really', 'be', 'novel', 'inspired', 'lifestyle', 'artistic', 'choices', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Doors', 'Tom', 'Waits', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'Alas', 'facsimile', 'ironically', 'lost', 'way.3/10']",N/A

1604443,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00A2H9T8U,Paul Allaer,"[7, 8]","""On the Road"" (2012 release; 140 min.) is the movie adoptation of the 1957 ""beatnik"" novel of the same name by Jack Kerouac. In the movie we follow two main characters: Dean (played by Garrett Hedlund) and Kerouac stand-in Sal (played by Sam Riley), as they travel around the country and meet a multitude of characters. There really is no ""plot"" as such and henre there is no risk of ruining your viewing experience by revealing the (non)plot.Several comments: first, the movie is intended to convey the world of the beatniks (think also William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg), and as we see this unfold, you come to the realization that theirs is a world that is very narrow, contrary to what one might've expected. If it doesn't involve smoking (cigarettes or weed), drinking (alcohol or coffee), sex, and/or jazz music (and preferably all of those at once), then it's probably not worth experiencing. Of course there is also the writing of young Jack/Sal but the movie does not convey at all what really moves the writer or what his writing process really is. Second, as to the multitude of characters Dean and Sal meet, there is a fairly large ensemble cast and part of the fun of the movie is to figure out who is playing what role. An almost unrecognizable Viggo Mortensen plays a small role of someone named Old Bull Lee. Amy Adams plays a wild looking Jane (the wife of one of their friends). Kirsten Dunst has an equally small role as Camille, the mistress/eventual wife of Dean. But the performance that will gather the most attention is of course Kirsten Stewart, who looks incredibly young in here (it was only after seeing the movie that I came to realize this movie was filmed in 2010, yes, pre-Twilight: Breaking Dawn days, even though it is released AFTER both Twilight: Breaking Dawn movies came and went). Stewart does not hold back in the movie, and I thought she was very effective (and no, not because she did a number of nude scenes).The movie works best as a ""road movie"", when the characters find themselves in places like Louisiana, Nebraska, Colorado, etc. Yet despite all that, I had trouble connecting emotionally with the characters, or put differently: I lacked an emotional investment in these characters, and that makes for a flawed movie (same issue I had with last year's ""Anna Karenina"" starring Keira Knightley or earlier this year's ""Upside Down"" starring Kirsten Dunst). I also feel that the running time of the movie is excessive for the amount of material covered by the movie (overlong by at least 30 min. in my book). I do not know why it has taken this long to get the movie from production in 2010 onto the theaters here in the US in early 2013 (the movie premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival). I had a chance to see this last Fall when I was in Belgium for a family visit, but couldn't get to it and in any event I thought it'd play in US theatres soon. I was wrong! The movie finally opened this past weekend here in Cincinnati and the screening I saw this at was poorly attended (3 people besides myself), so I cannot imagine this will play very long in the theatre. That aside, this is still worth checking out, warts and all.",4,3.5 stars...

Stream of conscious, rambling and without a core narrative, I could see why it was considered unfilmable.Yet, a noble attempt was made to adapt the novel to film. In many ways, the film is flawed. For one, the behaviors  that once seemed wild are now tame in comparison to the Internet/Reality TV age. Also, it takes place in an America that doesn't exist anymore.Still, to me, the first selling point of the movie, is cinematographer Eric Gaultier's gorgeous scenery. Director Walter Salles makes generous use of Gaultier's work along with composer Gustavo Santaoalla's score to help evoke that long-lost American landscape.Interesting too is that the secondary and even less than secondary characters are probably more vivid than the narrator/lead character of Sal Paradise and his muse/focus, Dean Moriarty. From Bull Lee to the minor character of the Okie Hitchhiker, the characters who come into the story and back out were welcome respite from the rather dull Sal and the one-note Dean.I didn't feel like the movie changed my opinion of the book and the flaws of the book made it into the movie, but I did feel that the women of On The Road were great and while they didn't get a lot of screentime, they made more of an impact than the book version allowed.Overall, I did like the movie and while it didn't reach the level of Salles's ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" or ""Central Station"", Salles and his cast made a noble effort to bring to life a problematic classic American novel.",4,Liked it in spite of the flaws,1377561600,"08 27, 2013",2013,1555,"['Not', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'Road', 'was', 'considered', 'unfilmable', 'Stream', 'conscious', 'rambling', 'core', 'narrative', 'could', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'considered', 'unfilmable.Yet', 'noble', 'attempt', 'was', 'made', 'adapt', 'novel', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'flawed', 'one', 'behaviors', 'once', 'seemed', 'wild', 'are', 'now', 'tame', 'comparison', 'Internet/Reality', 'TV', 'age', 'Also', 'place', 'America', ""n't"", 'exist', 'anymore.Still', 'first', 'selling', 'point', 'movie', 'cinematographer', 'Eric', 'Gaultier', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'Director', 'Walter', 'Salles', 'generous', 'use', 'Gaultier', 'work', 'along', 'composer', 'Gustavo', 'Santaoalla', 'score', 'help', 'evoke', 'long-lost', 'American', 'landscape.Interesting', 'too', 'secondary', 'even', 'less', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'probably', 'more', 'vivid', 'narrator/lead', 'character', 'Sal', 'Paradise', 'muse/focus', 'Dean', 'Moriarty', 'Bull', 'Lee', 'minor', 'character', 'Okie', 'Hitchhiker', 'characters', 'who', 'come', 'story', 'back', 'out', 'were', 'welcome', 'respite', 'rather', 'dull', 'Sal', 'one-note', 'Dean.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'movie', 'changed', 'opinion', 'book', 'flaws', 'book', 'made', 'movie', 'did', 'feel', 'women', 'Road', 'were', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'screentime', 'made', 'more', 'impact', 'book', 'version', 'allowed.Overall', 'did', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'reach', 'level', 'Salles', 'Motorcycle', 'Diaries', 'Central', 'Station', 'Salles', 'cast', 'made', 'noble', 'effort', 'bring', 'life', 'problematic', 'classic', 'American', 'novel']",N/A

1604453,A4OQ81P4JMAOT,B00A2H9T8U,"The Aeolian Kid ""YOWZA!""","[12, 22]","A Book and Movie review of Jack Kerouac's ""ON THE ROAD - The Original Scroll""I bought this book on August 19, 2007 after it was first published. I began to read it on January 8, 2013 (my cousin Ted's birthday) and finished reading it on January 14th, 2013 at 3:00 am in the morning - in preparation to see the movie!On January 14, 2013, the official Jack Kerouac group in Lowell Massachusetts called ""Lowell Celebrates Kerouac!"" was scheduled to make a caravan trek into Boston to the AMC theater at the Boston Common on Tremont Street to see the movie made of the famous novel, ON THE ROAD, by Jack Kerouac - our belated and well-loved friend and literary mentor. Some of us had been waiting since 1957 to see this movie. It was a long time coming - and well worth the wait.This review will cover both the book (in the ORIGINAL S CROLL form) as well as the movie, directed by the acclaimed filmmaker, Walter Salles of The Motorcycle Diaries fame (See my movie review of that great movie at amazon.com here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4OQ81P4JMAOT?ie=UTF8&display;=public&page;=5&sort;_by=MostRecentReview )Jack Kerouac first wrote the original scroll version of ON THE ROAD in April of 1951 - but he had been working on it for years. According to the seven introductory prefaces to the ""Scroll"" version of ON THE ROAD, Jack Kerouac spent years of his life between 1947 and 1957 ""researching, ""working on, writing, editing, re-writing, and trying to get this book published. He believed in this book. To Jack Kerouac, it was not just his literary ""baby"" and second novel; it was a whole new way of approaching the art of writing in general and a whole new way of creating ""the great American novel"" in particular. Time has proven him right.As my uncle, Billy Koumantzelis - who was a very close friend of Jack's in the later years of his life while living in Lowell - said in the White Eagle Caf&eacute; where we all met in Lowell before embarking on out to Boston to see the movie, that it was ""time Jack got his due."" He was very pleased that the movie finally came out and that it was made so well - as a professional, dramatic, major motion picture about the life ""on the road"" that was immortalized in the book by his long lost friend. Make no mistake about it: ON THE ROAD is a great American novel - and this movie has done it justice.During a recent phone conversation that I had with Mr. John Sampas - a man of true class and Jack Kerouac's brother-in-law who looks over the Estate of Jack's literary legacy - John said that he was very pleased with the work that was published by the four writers who he commissioned to write the introductory prefaces to ""the original scroll"" version of Jack's book. These introductory passages are as important to read as the book itself - and should be read before reading the book, as they elucidate both the circumstances surrounding Jack Kerouac's life at the time between the years of 1946 and 1951 as well as the subsequent history and , now, mythological status of the creation of ON THE ROAD.The four writers who write the introductory prefaces to the scroll version of ON THE ROAD should all be commended for helping us all understand the whole story about this book. They are: Howard Cunnell, Penny Vlagopoulos, George Mouratidis, and Joshua Kuppets. They all - each and every one of them - make excellent points in their essays and their contributions to this publication are formidable and substantial. I would not have appreciated the book - or the movie - as much as I did if I had not first read their introductory prefaces or essays. They were all very good. Because of their work, I learned that there are actually four different versions of ON THE ROAD: the original scroll version of 1951; a second, shorter, later, edited version to please the publisher;, a third, longer, later version that includes many pages of what was later to be published as VISIONS OF CODY; and the regular, traditional, well-known, edited version of the ""Cody"" third version that was finally published in 1957 by Viking Press. This book had definitely been put through the ringer!If you are going to read ON THE ROAD, you absolutely must read the original scroll version that was published in 2007 by Viking Press / The Penguin Group with the blessings of John Sampas, Literary Representative of the Estate of Stella Sampas Kerouac; John Lash, Executor of the Estate of Jan Kerouac (Jack's deceased daughter); Nancy Bump; and Anthony M. Sampas (my old friend, Tony - and the nephew of the elder and now deceased Tony Sampas of ""Nicky's Bar"" where Jack hung out in Lowell with Tony and his friend Billy Koumantzelis, now called ""Ricardo's"") - who all own the combined Copyrights to the book. Bless their hearts for finally releasing this for the world to read - as well as for allowing the original scroll itself to be exhibited in Lowell, Massachusetts at the Boot Mills Museum of the Lowell Historical National Park at the confluence of John and French Streets, right up the block from the Jack Kerouac Park where the beautiful monuments by the sculptor, Ben Woitena, pay tribute to the literary legacy of Lowell's most famous son.I read the regular version of ON THE ROAD as a paperback in January of 1974. Let it be known right here and now: there is no comparison! When you read the original scroll version, it is just like Jack is talking to you. No kidding. It is not hard to read; it is not hard to understand; it is not boring and vulgar and crazy. People who say that don't know what they are talking about. People who say that are intellectually lazy, literally ignorant, and just plain stupid. They got it all wrong! If anything, it is very lucid, very comprehensive, and very descriptive of the main character's internal thoughts as well as of his surroundings. He captures America as it is. His scope is as deep as the Grand Canyon and as wide as the Mississippi River (which he loved like the Merrimack, according to Roger Brunelle). His writing is panoramic and cinematographic. It is as if he thinks like a panning, moving, movie camera - but one which makes the deepest and most descriptive audio commentary along the way of both the external surroundings as well as of the narrator's deepest thoughts and feelings concerning and influenced by those surroundings. It is truly incredible writing. Also: it is funny as hell. ... Jack Kerouac had a great sense of humor; that comes across explicitly when you are reading the scroll. His passion and compassion are profound. He is not just a man of words. He is not just a man about town. He is a man on a mission - a mission to immortalize America as he saw it and as he and his buddies experienced it.Check out this great Footnote from the bottom of page 32 of Howard Cunnell's excellent introductory essay, ""Fast This Time: Jack Kerouac and the Writing of On the Road"":*Interviewed in the documentary On the Road to Desolation (David Stewart, dir., BBC / NVC Arts Corporation, 1997), Giroux said: ""I would say in the first half of 1951, I was at my desk at Harcourt, Brace, and the phone rang and it was Jack, and he said, `Bob, I've finished it!' and I said, `Oh great, Jack, that's wonderful news.' He said, `I want to come over.' I said, `What, right now?' He said, `Yeah, I have to see you, I have to show you ...' I said, `Okay, come on, come over to the office.' We were on Forty-sixth Street and Madison Avenue. He came into the office looking ... high, looking, you know ... drunk, and he had a big roll of paper, like a paper towel like you use in the kitchen, big roll of paper under his left arm, and he was, you know ... This was a great moment for him, I understood that. He took one end of the roll and he flung it right across my office like a big piece of confetti, right across my desk, and I thought, `This is a strange manuscript. I've never seen a manuscript like this."" And he looked at me, waiting for me to say something. I said, `Jack, you know you have to cut this up. It has to be edited.' And his face flushed, and he said, ""There'll be no editing on this manuscript.' I said, `Why not, Jack?' He said, `This manuscript has been directed by the Holy Ghost.""Indeed! ...There are numerous notes of multiple examples from these introductory pages that I took which add even further illumination onto the writing of this book - and the inspiration of this movie, which the director and the filmmaker used as his guide in the creation of the film, even having come to Lowell to see the Scroll with his own eyes when it was on exhibit and, as my friend Mike Flynn recently noted in his essay in Howl In Lowell on the journey to see the film, was a great turning point and ""Eureka!"" moment for Walter Salles in his quest to translate the book into a motion picture - but there is not enough time and space to include them all here.I will quote three passages from the book itself now that will prove what a great writer that Jack Kerouac was. It will also prove that he had more on his mind than the mere chasing of kicks. It shows a profoundly deep and broad understanding at a young age of the underlying and all-permeating spiritual nature of reality. He was truly a seer.From pages 248 and 249:Bill rode into town with us and went right on talking. ""Take it easy Neal, we'll get there. I hope; hup, there's the ferry, you don't have to drive us clear into the river."" He held on. Neal had gotten worse since Texas, he confided in me. ""He seems to me to be headed for his ideal fate, which is compulsive psychosis dashed with a jigger of psychopathic irresponsibility and violence."" He looked at Neal out of the corner of his eye. ""If you go to California with this madman you'll never make it. Why don't you stay in New Orleans with me. We'll play the horses over to Graetna and relax in my yard. I've got a nice set of knives and I'm building a target. Some pretty juicy dolls downtown too, if that's in your line these days."" He snuffed. We were on the ferry and Neal had leaped out to lean over the rail. I followed, but Bill sat on in the car snuffling. There was a mystic wraith of fog over the brown waters that night, together with dark driftwoods; and across the way New Orleans glowed orange bright, with a few dark ships at her hem, ghostly fogbound Cereno ships with Spanish balconies and ornamental poops, till you got up close and saw they were just old freighters from Sweden and Panama. The ferry-fires glowed in the night; the same Negroes plied the shovel and sang. Old Big Slim Hubbard had once worked on the Algiers as a ferry deckhand; this made me think of Mississippi Gene too; and as the river poured down from mid-America by starlight I knew, I knew like mad that everything I had ever known and would ever know was One.Jack Kerouac capitalized the last word in that sentence - One - intentionally. ... As I always like to say: ALL IS ONE. You may be enlightened and know this already - or you may know it and not truly believe it - but Jack Kerouac knew it, believed it, and tried to live up to it. It was part of the essence of his basic spirituality as well as what made him tick. For from this realization - knowing that, indeed, ALL IS ONE - comes true human compassion. Call it Buddhist; call it Christian; call it whatever you want. The man had it.Also, the passage from this book - though not the part about the ferry - is touched upon in some of the dialogue in the movie when Jack and Neal and Lou Anne go to visit William Burroughs and leave off their traveling companion, there to re-join his new bride and wife, brilliantly played by ""Peggy"" in the TV series, MAD MEN. If you don't laugh your head off during this scene, you have no sense of humor. During this episode, the movie is even better than book in some ways. Uncle Billy always says that he admired and enjoyed meeting William Burroughs with Jack when they travelled to New York City together with Joe Chaput. He called Burroughs a true southern gentleman - and that he was - and it comes across quite clearly in this movie. The man had soul, and Viggo Mortensen captures him to a T. The scene of him going into the Wilhelm Reich-inspired, orgone-collecting outhouse is a hoot! (The Reich Museum is in Rangeley, Maine.)To further my point that Jack Kerouac was an enlightened sage and not just a young stud after sex, drugs, and Jazz (which in the earliest sense of the meaning of that word was American Black slang and code for SEX), check out this short passage from page 308:It was a hot afternoon. Reno, Battle Mountain, Elko, all the towns along the Nevada road shot by one another and at dusk we were in the Salt Lake flats with the lights of Salt Lake City infinitesimally glimmering almost a hundred miles across the mirage of the flats, twice-showing, above and below the curve of the earth, one clear, one dim. I told Neal that the thing that bound us all together in this world was invisible: and to prove it pointed to long lines of telephone poles that curved off out of sight over the bend of a hundred miles of salt. His floppy bandage, all dirty now, shuddered in the air; his face was a light --- ""Oh yes man, dear God, yes, yes!""That thing that bids us all together - that illusive ""IT,"" that ring that, as Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead sings on BLUES FOR ALLAH, can never be reached and just slips away when we try - is always right there, right under our noses, the whole time. STAR WARS calls it ""The Force."" It is very real, and it is explained very well by Ervin Laszlo in his book, Science and the Akashik Field of which you can read my review at amazon.com here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4OQ81P4JMAOT?ie=UTF8&display;=public&page;=1&sort;_by=MostRecentReview) ... There is a scene in the movie where Neal is driving his old Hudson through a snowstorm, with the windshield all covered with snow, and his head, wrapped around with a scarf, is sticking out the window in order to see the road up ahead before him so that he can drive the car, and it captures the essence of this last passage in the book.Finally, there is this third and last passage from page 381:The boys were sleeping and I was alone in my eternity at the wheel and the road ran straight as an arrow. Not like driving across Carolina, or Texas, or Arizona, or Illinois; but like driving across the world and into the places where we would finally learn ourselves among the worldwide fellaheen people of the world, the Indians that stretch in a belt around the world from Malaya to India to Arabia to Morocco to Mexico and over to Polynesia. For these people were unmistakably Indians and were not at all like the Pedros and Panchos of silly American lore --- they had high cheekbones, and slanted eyes, and soft ways --- they were not fools, they were not clowns --- they were great grave Indians and they were the source of mankind and the fathers of it. And they knew this when we passed, ostensibly self-important moneybag Americans on the lark in their land, they knew who was the father and who was the son of antique life on earth, and made no comment. For when destruction comes to the world people will stare with the same eyes from the caves of Mexico as well as from the caves of Bali, where it all began and where Adam was suckled and taught to know. These were my growing thoughts as I drove the car into the hot sunbaked town of Victoria where we were destined to spend the maddest afternoon of our entire lives.Wow! ... The humanity of this man is truly outstanding. He identifies totally with the Native American and other First Nation native peoples across the planet. Knowing that he was part Native American himself (Mohawk from the Iroquoian-speaking peoples of Canada), he could relate and empathize with the plight of the original Americans of this great continent.It is not my intention to spoil the reading of this book for you - or to spoil the viewing of this movie for you - but you need to understand that there was a lot more to Jack Kerouac than the constant portrayal of someone smoking yet again another cigarette, drinking another glass of whiskey (Uncle Billy says he preferred Hennesy Cognac), gyrating ecstatically on the dance floor before a live jazz band; falling into the arms of another sexy and loving woman in bed, taking peyote down in Mexico, smoking marijuana any chance he could get, or wandering around hitchhiking across the country like a bum with a backpack over his shoulders (a backpack which now resides in a protective glass case in the Mogan Cultural Center Museum on French Street in Lowell, Massachusetts). No. These are allof the superficial images that the unknowing attribute to him as the only things that characterized him. None of these activities defines Jack Kerouac or the totality of the man: his heart, his mind, his personality, his soul. His was a great spirit in every respect - and this comes across in both the book and the movie, if you read and watch closely.Sure, this book was originally censored and edited and cut to pieces by the conservative consensus reality mindset of the editors and publishers of his day. But thanks to Jack Kerouac - and to all of his other writings, as well as to those of his friends like Corso, and Ginsberg, and Burroughs, and Ferlinghetti, and others - this movie of ON THE ROAD, 56 years later, will not be censored (though I am sure it was edited, and I long to see the Director's Cut on Blu-ray disc soon!) The movie is great! ... Yes, it is Rated R - and with good reason (Would you have it any other way?). The R stands for: rambunctious, raucous, reckless, restless, rowdy, and most definitely raw; but it also stands for religious, righteous, rebellious (in a good way - against the consumerist madness of the military industrial complex mindset of the times), and most definitely real. Yes, it does not get any more REAL than this.As for ""religious,"" people need to realize that there are more forms of religion than conservative sects of Christianity. There are even some people in the world - like the ancient Kalash people, descended from the soldiers of Alexander the Great, in Afghanistan and Pakistan - who still worship the ancient Greek god, Dionysus. Ever been to a Grateful Dead concert? The great modern mythologist, Joseph Campbell himself, has been noted as saying that it is the closest thing to an exhibition of uninhibited Dionysian revelry that he has ever experienced. So, yes - ON THE ROAD - both the book and the movie are ""religious"" in the truest sense of that word. Both the book and the movie portray religious experiences firsthand. In one sense, what isn't a religious experience? ...Jack Kerouac has finally got his due, indeed ... and there is more to come down that Pacific Coast Highway than meets the eye - very soon!YOWZA!-

Francis Ford Coppolla has owned the rights to the book since 1979 and after several failed attempts Coppolla has finally produced an On The Road movie.Reviews are mixed on this one and YES there is a ton of detail missing from the film that was in the book, but unless you want a 10 hour ""On The Road"" miniseries, this will do for now. The actors are all excellent, the period settings are fantastic and the story flows like whiskey into a glass. I hoped to like On The Road but I wound up REALLY liking it. It's taking forever for this movie to come to Blu ray in the US (it's been available in the UK for months now) but I think I'll be picking it up to own. If anything, On The Road (the movie) is interesting enough to get a whole new generation to pick up the book.

1604458,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B00A2H9T8U,William Timothy Lukeman,"[3, 3]","Although I've always considered ""On the Road"" essentially unfilmable, as someone who loves Kerouac's writing, I really wanted this film to succeed. But while it was better than I'd feared, it still wound up being unsatisfying in the end, even though it was well-made & had some vivid & effective scenes.The problem, as I'd suspected, is that it's extremely difficult to create a cinematic equivalent of Kerouac's prose. We see what happens in the book; but of course what really matters isn't just what happens, but how the narrator/writer feels about it & writes about it. There's plenty of hedonism & wildness on-screen, as well as too much graphic sex for the good of the picture (though I salute the film's forthright depiction of Dean Moriarity's cheerful pansexuality). We get plenty of surface, much of it electric; but there's isn't very much beneath that surface. The intellectual & spiritual dimensions of the book are lost for the most part; you get more of a feel for that from the brief appearances of Carlo Marx (Allen Ginsberg), for example. And they've quite clearly added material taken from the biographies of the main characters that doesn't necessarily appear in the novel, as if they couldn't quite decide between outright biopic & novel adaptation. (Granted, the line between the two in this case is paper-thin.)For me, there was also a certain distancing effect. I was all too aware that I was watching actors playing roles, rather than simply seeing the characters. ""Oh, there's Steve Buscemi doing a cameo!"" That sort of thing. ""Here I am playing Kerouac, er, Sal Paradise, in Mexico; here I am playing Cassady, er, Dean Moriarity, listening to jazz."" I'm always aware of the actors working at their roles; they never seem to fully inhabit the characters they're playing. As I say, everyone does his or her best. But it just remains largely flat as a film, ending on a morose note, with a shot of Moriarity/Cassady walking down a train track, an obvious reference to where & how he died. There's plenty of frenetic excitement & movement in the film to be sure, but not a lot of joy.I remain curious & hopeful about the upcoming film of ""Big Sur"", and still think that ""The Dharma Bums"" could be quite successfully adapted into film. But on the whole, in translating Kerouac to other media, I think the audiobook with a good reader is the best bet. As for Kerouac on film, the largely unknown independent film ""Beat Angel"" comes as close as you can get & is well worth checking out.",3,"Everyone tried hard, but it lacks heart",1381795200,"10 15, 2013",2013,2506,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'considered', 'Road', 'essentially', 'unfilmable', 'someone', 'who', 'Kerouac', 'writing', 'really', 'wanted', 'film', 'succeed', 'was', 'better', ""'d"", 'feared', 'still', 'wound', 'up', 'being', 'unsatisfying', 'end', 'even', 'was', 'well-made', 'had', 'vivid', 'effective', 'scenes.The', 'problem', ""'d"", 'suspected', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'create', 'cinematic', 'equivalent', 'Kerouac', 'prose', 'see', 'what', 'book', 'course', 'what', 'really', 'matters', ""n't"", 'just', 'what', 'how', 'narrator/writer', 'plenty', 'hedonism', 'wildness', 'on-screen', 'as', 'well', 'too', 'much', 'graphic', 'sex', 'good', 'picture', 'salute', 'film', 'forthright', 'depiction', 'Dean', 'Moriarity', 'cheerful', 'pansexuality', 'get', 'plenty', 'surface', 'much', 'electric', ""n't"", 'very', 'much', 'beneath', 'surface', 'intellectual', 'spiritual', 'dimensions', 'book', 'are', 'lost', 'most', 'part', 'get', 'more', 'feel', 'brief', 'appearances', 'Carlo', 'Marx', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'example', ""'ve"", 'quite', 'clearly', 'added', 'material', 'taken', 'biographies', 'main', 'characters', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'appear', 'novel', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'decide', 'outright', 'biopic', 'novel', 'adaptation', 'Granted', 'line', 'two', 'case', 'paper-thin', 'was', 'also', 'certain', 'distancing', 'effect', 'was', 'too', 'aware', 'was', 'watching', 'actors', 'playing', 'roles', 'rather', 'simply', 'seeing', 'characters', 'Oh', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'doing', 'cameo', 'sort', 'thing', 'Here', 'am', 'playing', 'Kerouac', 'er', 'Sal', 'Paradise', 'Mexico', 'here', 'am', 'playing', 'Cassady', 'er', 'Dean', 'Moriarity', 'listening', 'jazz', ""'m"", 'always', 'aware', 'actors', 'working', 'roles', 'never', 'seem', 'fully', 'inhabit', 'characters', ""'re"", 'playing', 'say', 'everyone', 'best', 'just', 'largely', 'flat', 'film', 'ending', 'morose', 'note', 'shot', 'Moriarity/Cassady', 'walking', 'down', 'train', 'track', 'obvious', 'reference', 'where', 'how', 'died', 'plenty', 'frenetic', 'excitement', 'movement', 'film', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'lot', 'joy.I', 'remain', 'curious', 'hopeful', 'upcoming', 'film', 'Big', 'Sur', 'still', 'think', 'Dharma', 'Bums', 'could', 'be', 'quite', 'successfully', 'adapted', 'film', 'whole', 'translating', 'Kerouac', 'other', 'media', 'think', 'audiobook', 'good', 'reader', 'best', 'bet', 'Kerouac', 'film', 'largely', 'unknown', 'independent', 'film', 'Beat', 'Angel', 'as', 'close', 'can', 'get', 'well', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",N/A
