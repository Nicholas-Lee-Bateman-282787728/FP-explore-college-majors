346595,A26KYDJOAGI05S,6302937035,Audiaa,"[2, 3]","This workout is very repetitive; I got bored doing it the very first time.  The instructions aren't that hard to follow, but the moves require turning around a lot so you can't watch what you are supposed to be doing.  One of the kicks that is repeated many times requires turning and kicking at the same time while this move isn't that difficult, it puts strain on my knees.  The instructor could be intimidating to beginners because she is always kicking to the ceiling without giving much encouragement for less experience people.  I'm sure that this workout does burn a lot of calories if you can get through it, but then again so does jumping up and down in place.",2,Yawn,1041724800,"01 5, 2003",2003,669,"['workout', 'very', 'repetitive', 'got', 'bored', 'doing', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'instructions', 'are', ""n't"", 'that', 'hard', 'follow', 'moves', 'require', 'turning', 'around', 'lot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'doing', 'One', 'kicks', 'repeated', 'many', 'times', 'turning', 'kicking', 'same', 'time', 'move', ""n't"", 'difficult', 'strain', 'knees', 'instructor', 'could', 'be', 'intimidating', 'beginners', 'always', 'kicking', 'ceiling', 'giving', 'much', 'encouragement', 'less', 'experience', 'people', ""'m"", 'sure', 'workout', 'burn', 'lot', 'calories', 'can', 'get', 'then', 'again', 'so', 'jumping', 'up', 'down', 'place']",N/A

I've done real kickboxing as well as cardio-kickboxing, and the sport is very exciting, but you would never know it from this video. The instruction is slow and boring, and the attempts to cater it to different levels just don't work.

I wouldn't recommend it to  beginners because it doesn't really make you want to come back and do it  again, but it's still a challenging workout and leaves my shoulders feeling  tender the next day!If you're really looking for some fun aerobic  boxing/kickboxing, I would suggest Kathy Smith's Aerobox and Kickboxing  videos, but for the more serious exerciser I would give Stephanie Steele's  video a fair chance.  Rent it first if you can.",4,"Not for everyone, but worth trying...",953164800,"03 16, 2000",2000,698,"['have', 'agree', 'several', 'reviewers', 'workout', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'motivating', 'Stephanie', 'Steele', 'MOST', 'boring', 'instructor', 'video', 'have', 'virtues.I', 'personally', 'found', 'instruction', 'clear', 'nonsense', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'beginners', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'want', 'come', 'back', 'do', 'again', 'still', 'challenging', 'workout', 'shoulders', 'feeling', 'tender', 'next', 'day', ""'re"", 'really', 'looking', 'fun', 'aerobic', 'boxing/kickboxing', 'would', 'suggest', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'Aerobox', 'Kickboxing', 'videos', 'more', 'serious', 'exerciser', 'would', 'give', 'Stephanie', 'Steele', 'video', 'fair', 'chance', 'Rent', 'first', 'can']",N/A
346598,A38VVOTC7EG8YM,6302937035,P. Sherman,"[6, 7]","Could this video possibly be worse?  I am new to this sport butold hand at exercise videos, and this has almost nothing right withit.  From the opening shots of Stephanie romping in the ocean with her family, it's a loser.  She is literally whispering the instructions in the warm up, kind of under her breath.  I wonder if they inadvertently released one of her warmup rehearsals because she is mostly talking to herself here--certainly not to motivate her audience.  The music has no discernible beat, but rather is a sort of 70's style sax and drum-riff background, which couldn't be more boring.  (If you watch carefully, she actually looks bored herself about 20 minutes into it.) She doesn't seem to understand the nature of working out to a video. If you mirror her pose to follow along, you will have to turn your head to see the screen, which of course is the wrong stance--she could at least have split the screen so you can see the proper stance, but mimic her straight on, eyes front.  With no beat to go by, it's difficult to follow along at her pace anyway, and you're best off getting the combination she wants down and using your own music!  She should pull this video from the market, since I will never use any of her videos, based on this one--although perhaps she really shines at something less dynamic than kickboxing.  Do not buy this video, do not really even rent it, find something else instead.",1,Does this sound familiar?,954979200,"04 6, 2000",2000,1421,"['Could', 'video', 'possibly', 'be', 'worse', 'am', 'new', 'sport', 'butold', 'hand', 'exercise', 'videos', 'almost', 'nothing', 'right', 'withit', 'opening', 'shots', 'Stephanie', 'romping', 'ocean', 'family', 'loser', 'literally', 'whispering', 'instructions', 'warm', 'up', 'kind', 'breath', 'wonder', 'inadvertently', 'released', 'one', 'warmup', 'rehearsals', 'mostly', 'talking', 'herself', 'here', 'certainly', 'not', 'motivate', 'audience', 'music', 'discernible', 'beat', 'rather', 'sort', '70', 'style', 'sax', 'drum-riff', 'background', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'boring', 'watch', 'carefully', 'actually', 'bored', '20', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'nature', 'working', 'out', 'video', 'mirror', 'pose', 'follow', 'along', 'will', 'have', 'turn', 'head', 'see', 'screen', 'course', 'wrong', 'stance', 'could', 'least', 'have', 'split', 'screen', 'can', 'see', 'proper', 'stance', 'mimic', 'straight', 'eyes', 'front', 'beat', 'go', 'difficult', 'follow', 'along', 'pace', 'anyway', ""'re"", 'best', 'getting', 'combination', 'down', 'using', 'own', 'music', 'should', 'pull', 'video', 'market', 'will', 'never', 'use', 'videos', 'based', 'one', 'perhaps', 'really', 'shines', 'something', 'less', 'dynamic', 'kickboxing', 'Do', 'not', 'buy', 'video', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'even', 'rent', 'find', 'something', 'else', 'instead']",N/A
346599,A3SAU1A0IEYDNX,6302937035,Soaring Heart,"[6, 7]","MUSIC: Ok so the music isn't the best, what workout tapes are? Put in your own music if you want.  I usually do with workout tapes anyway.  But this one I don't.  I am completely focused on Stephanie's instructions and style.DIFFICULTY: I will admit at first I thought I was going to die and couldn't finish the workout.  But as she says, &quot;Stick with this workout and I promise you'll be amazed at how you feel and how your body looks.&quot; By her non-pushy way of telling us, &quot;If you need a break, marching in place is fine or take a sip of water.&quot; By doing these things I am able to recover and get right back with her shortly.  Then I just rewind the tape.ANGLE: Stephanie doesn't turn straight to the camera as so many instructors to my chagrin do, so you can be on the same foot/side of the body as her by facing forward to the tv as she faces sideways. Also she states whether to be facing on my left or right side so it helps me keep up with her.INSTRUCTION: She has excellent form and is a laid-back but powerful, dynamic instructor. She begins slowly and has beginner, intermediate and advanced levels.  I am now advanced yet I still do the whole tape to keep good form and warm up properly for the harder levels.  Her warm-ups and cool-downs are fabulous and she knows how to get down to business but explains the moves clearly. It is a lot like interval training with fast and slow moves to recover, always starting slow.  Stephanie is an amazing woman who admits she's a mom with two kids and like most people, doesn't have &quot;hours to spend exercising.&quot; She created this workout because it lends fast results.RESULTS: I have worked out to the tape at least 15-20 times and I've continually improved in form and speed. It is always challenging and never boring.  It makes my body feel great, puts me in a wonderful mood, helps me sleep, and enpowers me with confidence.  I love the idea of learning skills of self defense while at the same time, burning calories.  This is a non-contact workout yet, when I do it, I always have a target in mind such as a picture or object I choose in the room that is at or above my eye level so my kicks and punches are efficiently administered.A WORD OF CAUTION: Do pay close attention to her instructions to avoid injury-- mainly on the jab, cross, roundhouse combination.  You have to pivot the ankle supporting the kick or could hurt your knee. She tells and shows this. Also the hook is a punch that can get you very sore so go easy at first. The rest of the workout, besides the fact you will get sore most likely at first, is very safe.FUN: This is a workout I truly enjoy and do over and over so it gets 5 stars! Try kickboxing, you'll feel terrific! Mrs. Steele recommends doing the workout two-three times a week.  I rotate this with two completely different tapes but this is my favorite. Kick, punch and Soar! ^_^",5,&quot;It'll make you feel so Alive!&quot;,1062633600,"09 4, 2003",2003,2896,"['MUSIC', 'Ok', 'music', ""n't"", 'best', 'what', 'tapes', 'are', 'Put', 'own', 'music', 'want', 'usually', 'do', 'workout', 'tapes', 'anyway', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'am', 'completely', 'focused', 'Stephanie', 'instructions', 'style.DIFFICULTY', 'will', 'admit', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'die', 'could', ""n't"", 'finish', 'workout', 'quot', 'Stick', 'workout', 'promise', ""'ll"", 'be', 'amazed', 'how', 'feel', 'how', 'body', 'looks.', 'quot', 'non-pushy', 'way', 'telling', 'quot', 'need', 'break', 'marching', 'place', 'fine', 'take', 'sip', 'water.', 'quot', 'doing', 'things', 'am', 'able', 'recover', 'get', 'right', 'back', 'shortly', 'Then', 'just', 'rewind', 'tape.ANGLE', 'Stephanie', ""n't"", 'turn', 'straight', 'camera', 'so', 'many', 'instructors', 'chagrin', 'do', 'can', 'be', 'same', 'foot/side', 'body', 'facing', 'forward', 'tv', 'sideways', 'Also', 'be', 'facing', 'left', 'right', 'side', 'keep', 'up', 'her.INSTRUCTION', 'excellent', 'form', 'laid-back', 'powerful', 'dynamic', 'instructor', 'slowly', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'levels', 'am', 'now', 'advanced', 'yet', 'still', 'do', 'whole', 'tape', 'keep', 'good', 'form', 'warm', 'up', 'properly', 'harder', 'levels', 'warm-ups', 'cool-downs', 'are', 'fabulous', 'how', 'get', 'down', 'business', 'moves', 'clearly', 'lot', 'interval', 'training', 'fast', 'slow', 'moves', 'recover', 'always', 'starting', 'slow', 'Stephanie', 'amazing', 'woman', 'who', 'mom', 'two', 'kids', 'most', 'people', ""n't"", 'have', 'quot', 'hours', 'spend', 'exercising.', 'quot', 'created', 'workout', 'fast', 'results.RESULTS', 'have', 'worked', 'out', 'tape', 'least', '15-20', 'times', ""'ve"", 'continually', 'improved', 'form', 'speed', 'always', 'challenging', 'never', 'boring', 'body', 'feel', 'great', 'wonderful', 'mood', 'sleep', 'enpowers', 'confidence', 'love', 'idea', 'learning', 'skills', 'self', 'defense', 'same', 'time', 'burning', 'calories', 'non-contact', 'workout', 'yet', 'when', 'do', 'always', 'have', 'target', 'mind', 'such', 'picture', 'object', 'choose', 'room', 'eye', 'level', 'kicks', 'punches', 'are', 'efficiently', 'administered.A', 'WORD', 'OF', 'CAUTION', 'Do', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'instructions', 'avoid', 'injury', 'mainly', 'jab', 'cross', 'roundhouse', 'combination', 'have', 'pivot', 'ankle', 'supporting', 'kick', 'could', 'hurt', 'knee', 'Also', 'hook', 'punch', 'can', 'get', 'very', 'sore', 'so', 'go', 'easy', 'first', 'rest', 'workout', 'fact', 'will', 'get', 'sore', 'most', 'likely', 'first', 'very', 'safe.FUN', 'workout', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'do', '5', 'stars', 'Try', 'kickboxing', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'terrific', 'Mrs.', 'Steele', 'doing', 'workout', 'two-three', 'times', 'week', 'rotate', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'tapes', 'favorite', 'Kick', 'punch', 'Soar', '^_^']",N/A
