665257,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005MEPP,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 5]","Parts of this review have been used previously in reviewing John Dos Passos' ""The Shackles of Power"". Many of the points addressed in that review on Jefferson and the nature of the Jeffersonian period in American history apply here as well.I have spent gallons of ink around this July 4th celebratory time every year, and I believe justifiably so given the objectives of this site, drawing some strong distinction between various periods of the common American historical experience. I have extolled  the early days of the American Republic when it held out, to paraphrase what Lincoln noted  later in the crucible of the Civil War, another high point in the American experience, the promise  that  the ""America democratic experiment represented the last, best hope of mankind"". And Lincoln was right then. In contrast I have heaped scorn, and that is an appropriate word here, on later periods lambasting the turn to the American imperium that we still suffer under.  Of course, none of this periodization is all cut and dried but today; at least, I want to go back to that earlier, more hopeful period of the birth of the American Republic.Normally, when one thinks of the early period of the American Republic one's thoughts turn to the struggle for independence from impetuous British imperialism, the subsequent fights to create some workable form of government and the consolidation of the American state, against all comers, as a factor in world history. The names Washington, Adams, Morris, Franklin and the like come easily to mind in that narrative. Moreover, lately, the period had been worked over almost to exhaustion as if resurrecting that heroic period will shed some reflected light on today's ugly political scene.Today, though, in reviewing master documentary filmmaker Ken Burn's ""Thomas Jefferson"" I want to look at, as I did in reviewing John Dos Passos' older historical narrative (1966), ""The Shackles Of Power"", the period just after that consolidation when the contours of the disputes that would form the two major political philosophies that govern American politics got pushed center stage. This is the time of Jefferson and his acolytes, Madison and Monroe, and their partisans in the various state Democratic Republican organizations centered on the plebeian-supported local newspapers. And it is also the time when the original Hamiltonian federalist impulse that governed the firs period of American life petered out in that form with the passing away of its old leadership, its cranky secessionist politics and its elitist conceits. That is a good enough time span for our work, basically the period from Jefferson's hotly contested election in 2000 (oops, 1800) through the period formerly known as ""the era of good feelings"" (quaint, right?) to the period, today, now, tentatively, in the academy known as the period of the rise of ""Jacksonian democracy"". This is the heart of the Burns documentary and the part that makes for the most interesting aspect of the film.Those last points in the paragraph above are germane to Burns view of the Jeffersonian story. This is, after, all the age where the Alexander Hamilton-led Federalist pro-mercantile strong central government policies and the Jefferson-led Democratic Republican weak central government, strong state governments pro-""yeoman farmer"" policy fights came front and center. Those trends, in various guises, have continued to this day in the hurly-burly of every day democratic politics. Needless to say, this little capsule comment of mine concerning the outlines of the disputes is merely that, an outline. As with any documentary, Burns is confronted with that same problem of merely outlining the various political struggles. Take this documentary as a primer on the period. Not as the final wordOne of Burns virtues as a literary-oriented film man is that he, unlike many professional historians some of whom like Gary Wills populate this production, brings a snappy literary style to his narrative. Thus, he spends less time on the arcania of the internal politics of the Federalist and Democratic Republicans and more on outcomes. Thus, although Thomas Jefferson is the central character of this work, plenty of space is given to other secondary characters central to this narrative like the on/off relationship between Jefferson and his predecessor John Adams, the rise of James Madison and James Monroe in the early 1800's as adherents of the Jeffersonian tradition. And so on.Of course no history of this period is complete without a nod to Jefferson's inspired  acquisition of the Louisiana Purchase as an important, if not defining, aspect of creating what would be come the  American nation-state, the development of an internal transportation system, the rise of public education fostered by the post-presidential  Jefferson and the increasing politicization of the governing process through increased literacy, broadening the suffrage franchise and the formation, in embryo, of the party system.As I mentioned in the Dos Passos review, obviously a history documentary , well researched or not, that dates from an earlier time (even if here only ten years) will neither reflect the evolving tendencies in historical studies, such as they are, or the incredible increase in material sources to be drawn from that have become available since then. For example, the now ""hot"" issue of Jefferson's relationship with his slave mistress, Sally Hemings, and their children is a case in point. The ""talking heads"", including Professor John Hope Franklin,  that always drive documentaries , reflecting the received wisdom of the time pass on a rather agnostic view of their relationship, if not outright acceptance of the `evidence' for denial of the relationship. Also far too little critical mention is given to the importance of slave ownership to Jefferson's personal financial fate, whatever his philosophical views on the matter. Jefferson, in effect, is given pass on this issue. If a greater presidential figure like Abraham Lincoln can ""take heat"" for his racial views from today's historians then the slave-owner Jefferson does not deserve that pass. Notwithstanding those problems this is a good Jefferson primer. Watch it.",4,In The Time Of The Promise Of The American Republic,1245283200,"06 18, 2009",2009,6234,"['Parts', 'review', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'previously', 'reviewing', 'John', 'Dos', 'Passos',

665259,AHCVWPLA1O4X8,B00005MEPP,bixodoido,"[147, 156]","Ken Burns's documentaries are always well put together and very interesting.  This one on Jefferson is no exception.  The pictures, personal accounts, and music are what make his films so great.  In this documentary, Burns takes a look at the life of one of the founding fathers of our nation.As I said, I really enjoyed the style of this documentary, but there are problems as well.  Unlike his excellent film on the Civil War, Burns seems here to ignore some basic historical facts.  It's almost as if he tries to set up Jefferson as THE founding father instead of A founding father.  Credit to Jefferson for drafting the Declaration of Independence is well-deserved, but giving him full credit for the treaty in France (which Franklin, Adams, and Arthur Lee had much more to do with than he did) is stretching it a lot.When speaking of Jefferson's years in France, the film is silent as to the great friendship between he and John Adams.  Indeed, Adams is portrayed as the great antagonist, and Burns here calls him a friend and close ally of Alexander Hamilton (also not true).  Later, when Adams and Jefferson begin their famous correspondence late in life, you can barely understand why the two men are writing to each other (since it makes only passing mention of their previous close friendship).Ken Burns has given us another good documentary here, but it would have been better, in my opinion, to make this one a little longer to be able to provide a more accurate portrait of Jefferson's life.  Instead, many basic historical facts have been ignored, and we are left with a picture of Jefferson that, despite making him seem a great hero of the revolution (which he was), is not accurate.",3,"Great documentary, but the facts are a little hazy",1041552000,"01 3, 2003",2003,1699,"['Ken', 'Burns', 'documentaries', 'are', 'always', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'very', 'interesting', 'one', 'Jefferson', 'exception', 'pictures', 'personal', 'accounts', 'music', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'films', 'so', 'great', 'documentary', 'Burns', 'look', 'life', 'one', 'founding', 'fathers', 'nation.As', 'said', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'style', 'documentary', 'are', 'problems', 'well', 'excellent', 'film', 'Civil', 'War', 'Burns', 'here', 'ignore', 'basic', 'historical', 'facts', 'almost', 'set', 'up', 'Jefferson', 'THE', 'founding', 'instead', 'A', 'founding', 'father', 'Credit', 'Jefferson', 'drafting', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'well-deserved', 'giving', 'full', 'credit', 'treaty', 'France', 'Franklin', 'Adams', 'Arthur', 'Lee', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'do', 'did', 'stretching', 'lot.When', 'speaking', 'Jefferson', 'years', 'France', 'film', 'silent', 'great', 'friendship', 'John', 'Adams', 'Indeed', 'Adams', 'portrayed', 'great', 'antagonist', 'Burns', 'here', 'friend', 'close', 'ally', 'Alexander', 'Hamilton', 'also', 'not', 'true', 'Later', 'when', 'Adams', 'Jefferson', 'begin', 'famous', 'correspondence', 'late', 'life', 'can', 'barely', 'understand', 'why', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'writing', 'other', 'only', 'passing', 'mention', 'previous', 'close', 'friendship', '.Ken', 'Burns', 'given', 'good', 'documentary', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'opinion', 'make', 'one', 'little', 'longer', 'be', 'able', 'provide', 'more', 'accurate', 'portrait', 'Jefferson', 'life', 'Instead', 'many', 'basic', 'historical', 'facts', 'have', 'been', 'ignored', 'are', 'left', 'picture', 'Jefferson', 'making', 'seem', 'great', 'hero', 'revolution', 'was', 'not', 'accurate']",N/A

Nobody shall be above you nor you above anybody.""  Such words of Jefferson's are the reason why John Adams last words (on July 4, 1826), ""Jefferson still lives,"" were still correct notwithstanding that Jefferson had passed away unbeknownst to the Adams household but hours before.  Jefferson biographer Joseph Ellis is quoted herein:  ""Part of Jefferson's genius was to articulate at a sufficiently abstract level these principles, these truths that we all want to believe in"" notwithstanding ""that these truths, at some level, are unattainable and at another level mutually exclusive.  Perfect Freedom does not lead to perfect equality, usually leads to inequality.""""He was a statesman,""  a ""reluctant politician."" ""He was a farmer,"" and ""a lover of fine wine"" the program informs us multiple times.  Jefferson characterized himself as ""a scientist first, a farmer second, a statesman reluctantly."" But of this connoisseur of fine imported wines, the program later informs us of this: ""often he diluted his wine with water.""  Sounds like the epitome of the paradox that is Jefferson.  Consider the following: For his inauguration Jefferson ""wore a plain suit and shoes that tied because he considered buckles undemocratic.""  Yet Jefferson excused the terror of the French Revolution in the spirit that ends exonerated undesirable means to various individuals.And then there's Jefferson's behavior relating to the enslavement of  people with darker skin than his; his calls for emancipation, for proposals on the issue while neglecting to take much if any personal action...........and if the Hemmings business is true (more about this qualifier in a second) makes a complete mockery of all his theorizing, proposals, and puts a black eye (pun intended) on his championing of equality for all.  Evidence has come to light since this program was made showing a DNA link between some of  the descendants of Sally Hemmings and the Jefferson family.  A committee appointed by The Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which runs Monticello concluded ""it is very unlikely that any Jefferson other than Thomas Jefferson was the father of [Hemmings's six] children.""  If he did take advantage of this woman, perhaps over many years, and not then free her in his will that's despicable is it not?  This program, however, only devotes 6 minutes to this whole Hemmings matter; a segment which concludes with these words by historian John Hope Franklin (whose ancestors might have been slaves themselves):  ""It doesn't really matter whether he slept with her or not."" How could it not matter as it would make a mockery of almost everything Jefferson ever said about slavery.  (""Most likely"" is not enough for me, however.  Even if the odds and conjecture suggest otherwise, perhaps the DNA in some---but interestingly, not in all---of Hemming's descendants came from Jefferson's brother or nephews and this is why these slaves were freed by Jefferson.  After all, why did Jefferson free all 4 of Sally Hemmings's surviving children, but not Sally herself upon Jefferson's death?)In addition, in this almost 3 hour program on the man who so expanded the size of the United States almost no mention is made of American Indians; save such fare as this: ""But despite his lifelong interest in native culture, Jefferson believed that white settlement was more important and encouraged the removal of nearly all the Eastern Indians from their homelands to the West.""  How about simply omitting ""But despite his lifelong interest in native culture.""Likewise the supposition that ""events overseas, along with his own stubbornness, insured that his second term would be marked by few successes"" is a statement that excuses too much.  ""Events overseas"" hardly engender American failure.  (The great American presidents, almost without exception, have achieved the moniker ""Great"" by rising to the challenge of extraordinary developments, often overseas.)  Jefferson's self-imposed embargo on the export of all American goods is, however, characterized honestly: ""it was a disaster,"" this program informs us; besides criticizing Jefferson for having merchantmen ordered arrested and their ships searched without warrants. Maybe this is why Jefferson's self-written gravestone pointedly omits his executive experience (as well as his prior executive experience: ""In 1779 Jefferson was selected war governor of Virginia.  His tenure soon proved a nightmare."")""It would take many years before the American people knew that Jefferson had written the most important document in their history.""  Imagine for a moment if we never did.

665263,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B00005MEPP,Charles Ashbacher,"[8, 11]","The Declaration of Independence is without question the greatest single statement regarding the rights of humans. A combination of idealism and practical politics, it is very underappreciated in the extent it was revolutionary. At a time when the world was ruled by religion and aristocracy, it said that all men are endowed by nature with certain rights, including the right to choose their governors. Scoffed at by the ruling class of Europe, it still survives at a time when they have been reduced to the fodder of tabloid rags. Written almost exclusively by Jefferson, that alone would have made him immortal. And yet, he did so much more, rightfully still considered a legend for the caliber of his intellect.In this film the historical context for this document and what it meant to the world is presented in a manner that brings lumps to your throat. The American break with England was an incredible revolution, and unlike those in Russia and France, was much less bloody and far more permanent. That aspect of the story is made very clear, something that not all historical accounts manage to do.However, there was more to Jefferson than his role in the creation of the United States. He put forward a bill to abolish slavery, he helped found the first public University and drafted much of the reasoning that led to the separation of church and state. The driving force for so many different revolutionary changes, there is no question in my mind that he is in a close race with George Washington as the greatest American of all time.Much is made in the film about the contradictions of his life. Although he opposed slavery, he was a lifelong slaveholder and did not press for abolition. To me, this point is vastly overstated in the film. No one else could have introduced a bill to abolish slavery and the critics seem to forget that it took nearly a century and a bloody war to finally eliminate it from the country. Nearly a century after that, people such as Eleanor Roosevelt and Earl Warren were being vilified for their support of equal rights for blacks. Jefferson understood the problems that slavery posed for the country, and he should be praised for his foresight. He understood that the issue had the power to split the nation, and since it was still so young, he chose to preserve the union rather than abolish slavery.This is one of the best historical films ever made. Jefferson is still the greatest intellect that this country has ever had and any criticism of him is dwarfed by his achievements.

665269,A11ZW62AAM10NU,B00005MEPP,Guitar Fan,"[2, 7]","I hesitated for a long time before finally ordering this because Liberty & small, responsible government & states rights advocate Thomas Jefferson is the most slandered, misrepresented, slandered, misrepresented, slandered and misrepresented of the Founders, which I guess is a step up from all of those who are completely disregarded, but it is difficult to find a worthy presentation of Thomas Jefferson's life that I'd consider to be worth the money, especially on DVD.The Founding Brothers and Founding Fathers discs from the History channel are perfect example of that. Total garbage best used as coasters.This disc however was much better and correctly told much of his story with respect, but with some really disappointing elements. For one, Thomas Jefferson had slaves on his estate. Did you know that? I think we all do, In many history presentations and even some of our own Park Service presentations, that's pretty much ALL they tell you about him, so I don't think it's really necessary to repreatedly present that fact through the 3 hours of this program while leaving out MAJOR parts of the Jefferson story. It IS an important part of the story, but the repeated instances of the point could be cut in half and replaced with the stories of each of the NUMEROUS (16?) pieces of legislation and his quotes in favor of abolition. Some of these were very briefly mentioned and some were just bypassed. Also bypassed was the passage and signing of the ban on importation of slaves to the USA when Jefferson was president. Also not discussed were Virginia state laws making release of Jefferson's slaves difficult and rquired great expense by law for the former slave holder. His failure to release them was compared to Washington's release of slaves, but it does not explain that Washington released his slaves upon his death, which was a legal option for him. Those laws were changed before Jefferson's death, making that option even more difficult. I could explain more, but I've already said far more that the DVD does on the matter.Next up ... How can they tell the story of Jefferson on TWO DVDs without including his letter to the Danbury Baptists stating that there is a wall of separation between church and state?!!! I know that the topic is fuel for disagreement, but We do KNOW What Jefferson meant when he wrote that letter (It's not a law. It's a letter!) and that is that government cannot dictate which religeon we follow, make an official religeon or prohibit the free excercise of religeon. Now, we all know the dispute. Some people say that he meant that we can't have inclusion of religeon or religeous symbols on public property or any interaction between government and religeon, but we do KNOW without a doubt that he disagreed with that because he wrote that letter on a friday and went to religeous services that Sunday in the house of congress and did so every sunday throughout his 8 years as President and at the time, services were held in the treasury office and war department office too ... and this went on for about 7 decades. All factual and not included! Why make the documentary and leave out that subject of massive historical significance and rights defining importance!??I'll give you two more left out significant parts of the story ...... 1. The narration says that ""a friend"" said that he viewed John Adams and Thomas Jefferson as the north and south poles of the revolution. The friend was important founding father Benjamin Rush! Couldn't they say his name? Benjamin Rush is the person who convinced Adams and Jefferson to rekindle their friendship and to write each other letters but wait, there's more! ... Also left out is fact 2, that although the narration covers the remarkable fact that Adams and Jefferson died on the same day, the 4th of July and 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, it leaves out the even more remarkable fact that when Benjamin Rush had written to Jefferson and Adams and convinced them to rekindle their friendship, he told John Adams that he had a dream that there would be years of correspondence, that generations would read the historical correspondence and amazingly that the two would fall into the grave at nearly the same time, which they did, hours apart!Also; DNA testing relating to Sally Hemmings family history and Jefferson was inconclusive, so to present anything beyond the original news paper story, written by a professional political slanderer and the fact that the test was inconclusive goes to the level of some supermarket newspaper that says a recent president met with aliens from mars, but this documentary went the extra mile to bring in some one who says his family story has said for generations that he's a decendant of Jefferson and Hemmings and then other commentary saying that SLave holders all took advantage of women slaves and Jefferson probably did too....  quite the slander and assault on the man's character if you ask me. That's NOT what I want to spend my money on. If it's true, I hope that he finds evidence and carries on the call for individual liberty and limited government, but right now, we just have a 200 year old article designed to weaken support for Jefferson and 2 centuries of repeating it.I really don't think that Jefferson is that hard to figure out as many say. He was pretty clear on his thoughts and preferences, with his repeated attempts to weaken, limit and abolish slavery, with his clear passion for religeous inclusion and with his intent that the federal government be very small and limited while the states attended to their own needs. Lincoln understood him clearly. We can too.

665273,ABP0RCZCVMRRG,B00005MEPP,"J. DeMeo ""naturalenergyworks""","[1, 4]","""This brings us to the crux of today's revisionism, elevating Adams and diminishing Jefferson. In our history, Jefferson has been the patron political saint for those who believe in small government, decentralized power, low taxes, and individual liberty. Thomas Jefferson, in other words, is the icon of everything today's Socialist-Marxist Left wants to destroy. They are delighted to minimize and demonize him."" -Lowell Ponte, FrontPage Magazine, 7/11/2001Burns is a leftist who seems unable to separate out his duty to the facts versus his political agendas.  This film reveals the problem by virtue of what was censored out of Jefferson's life story, and dubious material and cheap opinions which were pushed into it. Firstly, the film goes boring in many places, with much dead air time, long stretches of silence followed by opinionated mini-speeches by people who frequently don't like Jefferson, including several angry leftist blacks who try to make him into a pro-slavery personality.  More on that below.  The main narrator spoke slowly and with a speech slur -- why was he selected for this task?  Twice as much information could have been presented in the same time.Much attention was placed on the issue of slavery, but it was a-historical, falsifying Jefferson as a racist for not freeing the slaves he inherited from his father. Not mentioned was the inconvenient fact that the State of Virginia had laws forbidding the freeing of black slaves unless there was a specific act placed before the Virginia legislature and signed by the governor (for each slave freed), and in which case they had to leave the state along with their families. Jefferson, who opposed slavery systematically all his life, could not consent to this.  He wrote it would be irresponsible to free the slaves at Monticello when they had no place to go and no skills to build independent lives.  Homelessness and poverty would then threaten them, by his estimation. This was the late 1700s, not the mid 1800s or post-Civil War era when independent black towns and neighborhoods had finally been established in the northern cities.  So he trained them in skills, and some were freed, but mostly not.  I certainly cannot judge the situation looking back from today, but find it alarming how so many others can jump to such false conclusions about Jefferson's views on slavery.  Jefferson repeatedly introduced anti-slavery legislation into the US Congress, some of which passed while others were knocked down by the Southern slave-owning states. But while nothing of this was presented in the documentary, the entire push was to imply that the newly formed United States ""approved of slavery"" in total, and hence was a racist nation, when in fact only the southern states approved of it. All the states north of Virginia abolished slavery by the 1780s, earlier than the British Empire which did so in 1833.  Those northern American states were the very first political entities to abolish slavery among all the nations on the planet.  Burns' narrators say nothing of it, for what appears to be their own anti-American biases.Jefferson was also accused, years after the death of his wife, of having taken young Sally Hemmings, one of the black slave girls working at Monticello, as his secret mistress, bearing him many children. The accusation came from a political opponent in a scurrilous newpaper article, but it was mostly presented as 'fact' by Burns, with no referencing of conflicting evidence, when there is much.  The facts opposing the claim that Sally Hemmings was Jefferson's mistress, and bore him numerous children, also go unmentioned. A battled was waged between historians and scientific journals 15 years back on claimed DNA evidence ""proving"" that Jefferson fathered many mulatto children with Hemmings. However, this ""proof"" was never definitive for the simple reason it was based upon Y chromosome evaluations, and Thomas Jefferson had no sons who survived to adulthood to pass on their genes. So instead, descendants of Jefferson's uncle were used in the study, which could never prove anything conclusively. Burns did not mention anything about the DNA studies perhaps because he knows there is no definitive proof on that, but he drug out before the cameras any number of commentators -- all leftists -- who yammered on about what a bad guy he was for (unproven) sleeping with the young Hemmings, including one of the claimed black Jeffersonians. Meanwhile, all the written testimonials and historical evidence by people alive at the time, and the salacious newspaper articles written by Jefferson's political enemies which made the first accusations, show that young Sally Hemmings was never seen coming and going into Jefferson's bedroom, amid the crowds of people at Monticello or in Paris -- when as a handsome widowed US Ambassador Jefferson could have his pick among numerous admiring and beautiful women. In Paris, he supposedly carried on an intense romance with a white aristocrat female while secretly bedding Hemmings.  There simply is no defendable evidence he was fathering numerous children with one of his slave girls, by history or DNA, and as many historians have shown, such was completely at odds with his religious and moral character.Much detail on the Hemmings case is gathered on websites such as the ""jeffersondnastudy"" which you can look up. See specifically ""The Jefferson-Hemings DNA Study as told by Herbert Barger, Jefferson Family Historian"".  Barger, who was a part of the original DNA study group, documents the clamoring for personal fame by the physician authored the study that was firstly published in the British Nature magazine (editorially leftist).  That physician also failed to give credit to others who participated in the study, but who disagreed with the physician's (and Nature's) distortion of the evidence.  Barger also details a later critical review in Science magazine (politically liberal, but not leftist), which pointed out the inconclusive nature of the Nature claims. The DNA study was compromised by various vested interests -- a doctor seeking fame, leftists trying to slander Jefferson, and blacks trying to claim a part of history.  Also look up: ""Thomas Jefferson: A Defense of His Character"" for additional important and Burns-censored historical detail.As a ""documentary"" it also beggars belief that so many photographs of sad-faced slaves and plantation slavery were included in the film, as if it was a documentary about slavery rather than Jefferson, along with too many instances of haunting early audio recordings of post-slavery blacks singing old slave songs.  Photography of black slaves in America did not begin until the late 1840s, and Edison's first audio recordings date to 1878, all well after Jefferson's death.  By 1865, at the end of the Civil War, slavery was abolished also in the southern states. An excellent PDF is available on-line showing those earliest photos ""African Americans in Slavery: Photographhs 1847-1863"".  Burns displays those photos too many times throughout the documentary, for reasons which suggest further effort to tar Jefferson as a racist or pro-slavery, and America as hopelessly racist, neither of which was true. How many even know that about a third of all those lynched by the KKK during Reconstruction were white abolitionists?  Or that nearly half of all white immigrants into America during the 1700s were indentured slaves, paying off their passage to the New World, or sentenced by British courts for debt payment.  Slavery was toxic, with many abolitionists in the Americas, from day one, but only a leftist ""documentary"" would fail to note such facts.In the special features on this documentary, Burns boasted how his team did no traditional investigative research for the topic, but merely plunged into the archive material, and made their film clips ""on the wing"", following their noses. In this case their noses failed to inform on too much, or their political leftist biases made certain uncomfortable facts too inconvenient to mention.For example, nothing was mentioned about Jefferson's opposition to Federalists Hamilton and Adams during the Whiskey Rebellion, which certified Jefferson's role in support of small government ""Democratic Republican"" principles over aggressive and dictatorial Federalism of that time. There also was no mention at all of Jefferson's critical role, as President, in building up the US Navy to stop attacks by Barbary Pirates on US merchant ships.  The Muslim pirates had been raiding US ships in European waters, and killing or holding their crews and passengers captive for ransom. Rather than take the approach of the European nations, and pay never-ending tribute to Muslim warlords, Jefferson stood up to them, sent ships and troops into the Mediterranean, rescued most of the hostages and shelled the pirate strongholds, as in Tripoli (modern Libya).  No mention was made of this by director Burns, possibly because good leftists don't wish to remind you, the viewer, that Jefferson stood up to tyrants, or that the Muslim world has a long history of violence.There are several alternative DVD documentaries on Jefferson, but I have not seen them, so cannot recommend any at this time.  But this one by Burns is basically a time-waster, lots of photos of the same scenes at Monticello, the same paintings of Jefferson, against which narratives are made by frequently angry characters mouthing veiled hostility and questionable opinion. Some may enjoy Burn's style of picture-making, but when the facts are treated so badly, so much not ever mentioned, it fails to measure up.

665276,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005MEPP,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 7]","This 1996 two-part documentary by Ken Burns provides an introduction to the man who was the third President of the United States but did not feel the position was worth mentioning on his tombstone.  When he was 33 years old Thomas Jefferson wrote one of the most famous and important lines in the history of the entire world in the Declaration of Independence and over the next half-century of his life accomplished enough to warrant being on the nickel, Mt. Rushmore, and, ironically given his ability to embrace contradictory positions in his life's work, the $2 bill.Burns begins the documentary with an anecdote which is the 19th century equivalent of JFK's quip to a 1962 dinner for 49 Nobel laureates that it was &quot;the most extraordinary collection of talent, of human knowledge, that has ever been gathered at the White House-with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.&quot;  But the primary focus is on the inherent paradoxes of the man who could write the Declaration of Independence but own slaves, write about their unpleasant body odor, and avoided emancipating them.  The charges continue in kind: Jefferson denounced the idea of political parties yet founded the first one, denounced the moral bankruptcy of Europe but enjoyed the gilded Paris salons, deplored a centralized government and then became the chief executive of the nation and doubled its size by buying the Louisiana Purchase.The thesis of this documentary appears right before Jefferson's name appears at the end of the introduction: &quot;He remained a puzzle, even to those who thought they knew him best, embodied contradictions common to the country whose independence it fell to him to proclaim in words whose precise meaning Americans have debated ever since.&quot;  The key point here is not just that Jefferson is an enigmatic figure but that his paradoxes are those written in the soul of the nation.  It was not until Abraham Lincoln spoke at Gettysburg in November of 1863 that America finally accepted the proposition that &quot;all men are created equal,&quot; but it was Jefferson who wrote the proposition.  The gap between his vision and his actual achievement as a human being is arguably a defining element of the American spirit.Do I think that Jefferson fathered children by Sally Hemmings?  Yes, I do; the fact that she turned out to be the half-sister of his late wife Martha, along with his promise to Martha on her deathbed that he would never remarry, seems a compelling rationale to explain his behavior, although I would never confuse seeking physical comfort with love.  Why did Jefferson never free his slaves?  That is the question that will never be known for sure (there is at least enough DNA evidence to show that the Hemmings children were fathered by a Jefferson, whether Thomas or one of his relatives, perhaps his brother Randolph).  My best guess at this point would be that he was afraid of what would happen to his slaves if they were freed and sent off into the world out of the reach of his protection.  That his economic problems were such that the slaves were sold off after his death is but another contradiction in the long line of those that defined his life.By now we are as familiar with the method of a Ken Burns documentary the same way we know the conventions of a situation comedy, romance novel, or rock 'n' roll song.  The camera studies historic engravings and paintings before shifting to contemporary film taken in all four seasons of Jefferson's Monticello home and other key places from his life.  The documentary was written by Geoffrey C. Ward and Jefferson's words are spoken by actor Sam Waterston with Ossie Davis providing the narration.  Blythe Danner does the voice of Martha Jefferson, whom she played in the film version of the musical &quot;1776.&quot;  Many of those who have followed Burns' work will no doubt find much of the music familiar and be reminded from time to time of &quot;The Civil War&quot; and &quot;Baseball.&quot;If there is a failing in this documentary it is that it has trouble doing full justice to Jefferson's words, which in the final analysis are his greatest legacy and testament.  The problem is that Jefferson usually wrote on large pieces of paper and the camera cannot capture an entire line, forcing it to rely time and again on showing us a few choice words and phrases.  Yet there is no denying the power of those words or of seeing them written in Jefferson's own hand.",5,The Ken Burns PBS documentary of the great American enigma,1083542400,"05 3, 2004",2004,4482,"['1996', 'two-part', 'documentary', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'introduction', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'third', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'position', 'was', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'tombstone', 'When', 'was', '33', 'years', 'old', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'wrote', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'important', 'lines', 'history', 'entire', 'world', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'next', 'half-century', 'life', 'accomplished', 'enough', 'warrant', 'being', 'nickel', 'Mt', 'Rushmore', 'ironically', 'given', 'ability', 'embrace', 'contradictory', 'positions', 'life', 'work', '2', 'bill.Burns', 'documentary', 'anecdote', '19th', 'century', 'equivalent', 'JFK', 'quip', '1962', 'dinner', '49', 'Nobel', 'was', 'quot', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'collection', 'talent', 'human', 'knowledge', 'ever', 'been', 'gathered', 'White', 'House-with', 'possible', 'exception', 'when', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'dined', 'alone.', 'quot', 'primary', 'focus', 'inherent', 'paradoxes', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'write', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'own', 'slaves', 'write', 'unpleasant', 'body', 'odor', 'avoided', 'emancipating', 'charges', 'continue', 'kind', 'Jefferson', 'denounced', 'idea', 'political', 'parties', 'yet', 'founded', 'first', 'one', 'denounced', 'moral', 'bankruptcy', 'Europe', 'enjoyed', 'gilded', 'Paris', 'salons', 'deplored', 'centralized', 'government', 'then', 'became', 'chief', 'executive', 'nation', 'doubled', 'size', 'buying', 'Louisiana', 'Purchase.The', 'thesis', 'documentary', 'right', 'Jefferson', 'name', 'end', 'introduction', 'quot', 'remained', 'puzzle', 'even', 'who', 'thought', 'knew', 'best', 'embodied', 'contradictions', 'common', 'country', 'independence', 'fell', 'proclaim', 'words', 'precise', 'meaning', 'Americans', 'have', 'debated', 'ever', 'since.', 'quot', 'key', 'point', 'here', 'not', 'just', 'Jefferson', 'enigmatic', 'figure', 'paradoxes', 'are', 'written', 'soul', 'nation', 'was', 'not', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'spoke', 'Gettysburg', 'November', '1863', 'America', 'finally', 'accepted', 'proposition', 'quot', 'men', 'are', 'created', 'equal', 'quot', 'was', 'Jefferson', 'who', 'wrote', 'proposition', 'gap', 'vision', 'actual', 'achievement', 'human', 'being', 'arguably', 'defining', 'element', 'American', 'spirit.Do', 'think', 'Jefferson', 'fathered', 'children', 'Sally', 'Hemmings', 'Yes', 'do', 'fact', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'half-sister', 'late', 'wife', 'Martha', 'promise', 'Martha', 'deathbed', 'would', 'never', 'remarry', 'compelling', 'rationale', 'explain', 'behavior', 'would', 'never', 'confuse', 'seeking', 'physical', 'comfort', 'love', 'Why', 'did', 'Jefferson', 'never', 'free', 'slaves', 'question', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'known', 'sure', 'least', 'enough', 'DNA', 'evidence', 'show', 'Hemmings', 'children', 'were', 'fathered', 'Jefferson', 'Thomas', 'one', 'relatives', 'perhaps', 'brother', 'Randolph', 'best', 'guess', 'point', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'afraid', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'slaves', 'were', 'freed', 'sent', 'off', 'world', 'reach', 'protection', 'economic', 'problems', 'were', 'such', 'slaves', 'were', 'sold', 'off', 'death', 'contradiction', 'long', 'line', 'defined', 'life.By', 'now', 'are', 'familiar', 'method', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'same', 'way', 'know', 'conventions', 'situation', 'comedy', 'romance', 'novel', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'song', 'camera', 'studies', 'historic', 'engravings', 'paintings', 'shifting', 'contemporary', 'film', 'taken', 'four', 'seasons', 'Jefferson', 'Monticello', 'home', 'other', 'key', 'places', 'life', 'documentary', 'was', 'written', 'Geoffrey', 'C.', 'Ward', 'Jefferson', 'words', 'are', 'spoken', 'actor', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'Ossie', 'Davis', 'providing', 'narration', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'voice', 'Martha', 'Jefferson', 'whom', 'played', 'film', 'version', 'musical', 'quot', '1776.', 'quot', 'Many', 'who', 'have', 'followed', 'Burns', 'work', 'will', 'doubt', 'find', 'much', 'music', 'familiar', 'be', 'reminded', 'time', 'time', 'quot', 'Civil', 'War', 'quot', 'quot', 'Baseball.', 'quot', 'failing', 'documentary', 'trouble', 'doing', 'full', 'justice', 'Jefferson', 'words', 'final', 'analysis', 'are', 'greatest', 'legacy', 'testament', 'problem', 'Jefferson', 'usually', 'wrote', 'large', 'pieces', 'paper', 'camera', 'can', 'not', 'capture', 'entire', 'line', 'forcing', 'rely', 'time', 'again', 'showing', 'few', 'choice', 'words', 'phrases', 'denying', 'power', 'words', 'seeing', 'written', 'Jefferson', 'own', 'hand']",N/A

And even though he was shy, soft spoken, and totally lacking in oratorical ability, he would eventually become Governor of Virginia, Ambassador to France, and President of the United States.No one embodied the optimism of the American spirit more; yet he was a slave holder all of his life (even while others in Virginia were setting their own slaves free); and in the only book he ever wrote, he espoused the inferiority of the Negro race, (as if to imply that freedom and equality should apply to everyone but them).Much of the film deals with the political backroom maneuvering of the Electoral College which made him President; his lifelong feuding - and friendship with John Adams; his purchase of the Louisiana Territory; and his brief love affair with a married woman while he was Ambassador to France.  During his time away from politics, the biography also highlights Jefferson the scientist, the architect, and the supposed father of numerous mulatto children by his Negro mistress, Sally Hemmings.No one tells American history like Ken Burns.  His biographies of Mark Twain and Frank Lloyd Wright, and his accounts of Lewis &amp; Clark are inspirational and uplifting.  His remembrances of Thomas Jefferson, however, fall short.  Perhaps it's the subject.  Mr. Jefferson's life isn't without controversy.  Rather than coming across as almost superhuman in his accomplishments as we are hoping, this film makes him appear to be, at best, merely human.

665282,A3ATD1VNKRQ23C,B00005MEPP,Mr. Howell,"[0, 1]","I LOVE watching all of Ken (as well as Ric) Burns's stuff. There films are always visually-appealing, engrossing, entertaining masterpieces. The way they can make even still images come alive with sound and movement; and their balanced and thorough treatment of most subjects, makes their works a thorough delight to watch, regardless of your interest in the particular subject being covered.Watching their films truly brings history to life as no book or other documentaries can- and not only that, but they are just so aesthetically well-done, that they are the epitome of the art of entertainment- a veritable sm&ouml;rgsbord for the senses.I've always been a big fan of Tommy Jefferson's, also- so this DVD seemed like a natural for me! While I would rate the entertainment value of this film as tops, I do feel that it's treatment of the subject matter was a little lacking, and not quite up to the standards I would expect from either of the Burns's.While it does serve as a very good primer and intro to TJ; and as a good basic timeline of his life; and it does a reasonably good job of conveying the context of the times in which he lived, I do feel that it is sorely lacking as far as illustrating the political and philosophical concepts which TJ stood for, and which made him such a genius and a great man.Also, I'm sorry to say, that having a black man narrate most of film [and one with not the greatest voice] did seem to be a blatant contrast to the mood of the period in which the historic events took place, and considering that this piece is about a man who did not see blacks as being quite &#34;equal&#34;.Kudos to Mr. Burns though, for presenting both sides of issues, such as TJ's alleged diddling of one of his slaves, after his wife's death; and for pointing out that TJ was in-fact an advocate of abolition (and would have even succeeded in accomplishing it, but for one of his foes).One thing that really bugs me (and this is true of virtually all historical books and films) is the careless use of words and phrases which had quite different meanings in the past, than they do today. Words such as &#34;humanist&#34;; or &#34;public education&#34;[which, in the 18th and 19th centuries, meant: As contrasted with religious education- i.e. schools which were not started and operated by churches or religious institutions.  It did NOT mean a communal government school paid for through the taxation of all people, like we have today].Failing to make clear the true meaning of words which had vastly different meanings and connotations in the past, can be very misleading to a modern viewer- even if not meant to be so. Our revisionist text-books of today are blatantly guilty of that; only they do so on-purpose.All in all, this is a good intro to the life and times of TJ; as well as a thoroughly enjoyable form of entertainment. While it barely scratches the surface for even the mild history buff or aficionado of TJ, it is none-the-less a very enjoyable watch for all, even if you will not learn anything new from it.",4,Good Intro To TJ...But Somewhat Lacking,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,3047,"['LOVE', 'watching', 'Ken', 'as', 'well', 'Ric', 'Burns', 'stuff', 'films', 'are', 'always', 'visually-appealing', 'engrossing', 'entertaining', 'masterpieces', 'way', 'can', 'make', 'even', 'still', 'come', 'alive', 'sound', 'movement', 'balanced', 'thorough', 'treatment', 'most', 'subjects', 'works', 'thorough', 'delight', 'watch', 'regardless', 'interest', 'particular', 'subject', 'being', 'covered.Watching', 'films', 'truly', 'history', 'life', 'book', 'other', 'documentaries', 'can-', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'aesthetically', 'well-done', 'are', 'epitome', 'art', 'entertainment-', 'veritable', 'sm', 'ouml', 'rgsbord', 'senses.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Tommy', 'Jefferson', 'also-', 'DVD', 'seemed', 'natural', 'would', 'rate', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film', 'tops', 'do', 'feel', 'treatment', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'little', 'lacking', 'not', 'quite', 'standards', 'would', 'expect', ""Burns's.While"", 'serve', 'very', 'good', 'primer', 'intro', 'TJ', 'good', 'basic', 'timeline', 'life', 'reasonably', 'good', 'job', 'conveying', 'context', 'times', 'lived', 'do', 'feel', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'as', 'far', 'illustrating', 'political', 'philosophical', 'concepts', 'TJ', 'stood', 'made', 'genius', 'great', 'man.Also', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'having', 'black', 'man', 'narrate', 'most', 'film', '[', 'one', 'not', 'greatest', 'voice', ']', 'did', 'seem', 'be', 'blatant', 'contrast', 'mood', 'period', 'historic', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'considering', 'piece', 'man', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'blacks', 'being', 'quite', '34', 'equal', '34', '.Kudos', 'Mr.', 'Burns', 'presenting', 'sides', 'issues', 'such', 'TJ', 'alleged', 'diddling', 'one', 'slaves', 'wife', 'death', 'pointing', 'out', 'TJ', 'was', 'in-fact', 'advocate', 'abolition', 'would', 'have', 'even', 'succeeded', 'accomplishing', 'one', 'foes', '.One', 'thing', 'really', 'bugs', 'true', 'virtually', 'historical', 'books', 'films', 'careless', 'use', 'words', 'phrases', 'had', 'quite', 'different', 'meanings', 'past', 'do', 'today', 'Words', 'such', '34', 'humanist', '34', '34', 'public', 'education', '34', '[', '18th', '19th', 'centuries', 'meant', 'contrasted', 'religious', 'education-', 'i.e', 'schools', 'were', 'not', 'started', 'operated', 'churches', 'religious', 'institutions', 'did', 'NOT', 'mean', 'communal', 'government', 'school', 'paid', 'taxation', 'people', 'have', 'today', ']', '.Failing', 'make', 'clear', 'true', 'meaning', 'words', 'had', 'vastly', 'different', 'meanings', 'connotations', 'past', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'misleading', 'modern', 'viewer-', 'even', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'so', 'revisionist', 'text-books', 'today', 'are', 'blatantly', 'guilty', 'only', 'do', 'so', 'on-purpose.All', 'good', 'intro', 'life', 'times', 'TJ', 'as', 'well', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'form', 'entertainment', 'barely', 'surface', 'even', 'mild', 'history', 'buff', 'aficionado', 'TJ', 'none-the-less', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'even', 'will', 'not', 'learn', 'anything', 'new']",N/A

665284,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005MEPP,Robert Moore,"[39, 45]","This was an extremely pleasant television biography of our most complex president, and it certainly had a number of good things going for it.  For instance, there are many, many wonderful shots of Monticiello in all kinds of weather, and this seemed to bring the viewer closer to Jefferson than many such examinations of his life do.  And as in most of Ken Burns's undertakings, a number of eloquent scholars contributed their perspectives to the show.  But the fact is that the show ends up passing over too many facts and aspects of Jefferson's life.  By any standard, Jefferson is the most complex prominent American in our history.  More has been written about Lincoln, and while there are aspects of his personality that baffle us, compared to Jefferson he is a model of transparency.  So, I do not fault the documentary for leaving Jefferson a bit of a mystery.  As Joseph Ellis remarks in it (repeating the central image of his admirable biography), if Jefferson were a statue, he would be a sphinx.  I've read several biographies of Jefferson as well as at least a dozen or so books in which he features prominently, and the more I read about him, the perplexing aspects of his life and personality become more and not less baffling.The documentary does a decent job of hitting the high points of Jefferson's life, though there is a definite tendency to skip over some aspects, perhaps because of time limitations.  For instance, Jefferson was an absolutely awful vice president under Adams, and actively conspired to undermine his presidency, but no mention of this is made whatsoever in the series.  Brief mention is made of his struggles with John Marshall, but it isn't pointed out that the struggle was whether there was going to be an independent judiciary (Jefferson wanted to be able to replace justices--even supreme court justices--pretty much at will).  The point of an independent judiciary was to maintain a brake to public sentiment, other wise transitory popular opinion could create vast public mischief (think of the interment of Japanese American citizens during WW II and multiply it several times).Also, the historical complexity of Jefferson's thought isn't even hinted at.  Many of the most prominent Americans feel that Jefferson would have adjusted his thought under different historical circumstances (though one can reply to them that Jefferson has a strong utopian trend in his thought that renders much of what he envisioned as the ideal as profoundly unrealistic).  For instance, Lincoln considered himself a Jeffersonian while not acceding either to Jefferson's agrarian ideal or his belief in a small federal government.  Lincoln was a strong advocate of industrial development (he was a key figure in the building of the canals that made Chicago the key city in America's industrial and economic development in the 19th century) and in the government playing a major role in economic expansion.  But he fully embraced the ideal of equality as the core idea of the American project.  As the documentary points out, Jefferson embraces both the concept of equality and the idea of liberty, and did not seem willing to acknowledge that the two could be in conflict, whereas Lincoln's conception seemed to be promoting as much liberty as was compatible with insuring equality (at least in his matured thought).  Or take Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt, both who whom espoused the kind of popular democracy that Jefferson promoted and yet who thought that this could only be done through a strong central government that limited the grasp of trusts, robber barons, industrialists, or corporations (the terminology depending on what decade we are talking about).  Woodrow Wilson explicitly argued that Jefferson would have espoused a strong federal government if he had lived long enough to see full blown industrialization and the rise of the modern corporation.  Many of the Progressives argued much the same way, and it isn't an accident that it was in the New Deal that Jefferson's Memorial was authorized.Much of Jefferson's public life was dealt with in fairly hit or miss fashion.  For instance, there is good discussion of the writing of the Declaration of Independence, but the lack of detail of his presidency was stunning.  Much better was the discussion of his private life, including the Sally Hemming controversy.  The more I've read about the issue, the less certain I've become.  We live in a scandal-driven time, and we lend credence to low conduct too easily.  My own reading makes me very, very slightly inclined to believe that Jefferson was not the father of Hemming's children (we have no evidence from either of them, though one of Hemming's children claims she said on her death bed that he was), and the DNA evidence is less decisive and a good deal fuzzier than many commonly assume.  The fact is that you can compile a very long list of supporting arguments on both side of the issue.  But I think John Hope Franklin put it best:  in the end it doesn't matter, because the more crucial point is that she was his property, and that was the more reprehensible fact.  John Adams also disbelieved the accusation, but he also pointed out that with such a dreadful institution, such evils--whether rumored or actual--are inevitably going to arise.I would definitely encourage anyone to see this documentary.  If one has read no biographies of Jefferson, I would caution one to take the overall portrait with caution; if one is a seasoned student of Jefferson, one will delight in the host of visual images of Jefferson's world.  If one wanted to go on to read more about Jefferson, I would recommend as a very good one-volume biography that of Joseph Ellis, which does a marvelous job of explaining why we continue to find Jefferson so fascinating, with the added attraction that Ellis was one of the major contributors to the series.  The more ambitious could go on to consider Dumas Malone's exhaustive six-volume biography (which is not merely a great biography of Jefferson, but a marvelous portrait of the age) as well as Jefferson's NOTES ON THE STATE OF VIRGINIA and the Jefferson-Adams correspondence.  A significant portion of the documentary focuses on the latter, and I heartily agree that it is the finest correspondence between public figures in American history.  But it is more than that:  it is one of the great political classics in American history, belonging to such works as Paine's COMMON SENSE, THE FEDERALIST PAPERS, Tocqueville, and the Lincoln-Douglas debates.In the end, the faults of the documentary are probably most likely the result of the limited time allotted to the subject.  Jefferson is simply too vast a subject to be encapsulated in three hours.  Nonetheless, while this will hardly do as a complete portrait, it remains either a pleasing introduction or an enjoyable supplement.",4,Aesthetically pleasing but factually skimpy TV biography of

665285,A3QYHR31DF3YN6,B00005MEPP,Strawgold,"[0, 1]","I have tried to describe with some degree of expression the inspiration and influence Thomas Jefferson has provided me from beyond the constraints of time and space - but the English language, however poetic, eludes the scope of what it has meant for me as I searched for whatever it was our Forefathers had among them that made this Nation what it is.  Not as a youth did any of this come to me; the events of American History and the Revolution are wasted on the young.  It is presented to us in our school years, sometimes without passion, mostly without effectiveness and absent of the whetting of the imagination of the young.  It is later, much later that some of us wish to revisit, to comprehend, to try to feel for ourselves what drove these men to do what they did for us.  They are not so removed from us by the passage of time as we first think; they were as we are, dealing with the current climate of problems of immense proportions and far-reaching ramifications; the beginning of our today - we will set up the tomorrows for our own posterity - I surely hope we can do so well despite everything untoward that rises before us today.This Ken Burns DVD is a masterpiece of description for the life of Thomas Jefferson, but even under the direction of such as Burns, I felt he missed some of what Jefferson was truly all about, especially in the issue of slavery, and how he viewed those of color.  I had read the works of Jefferson, and drew some different conclusions from his words.  Historians will never fully agree on people or their thoughts, and neither will the lay persons who read the same works to find the nuggets for themselves.  I fear Jefferson's intellect and grasp of subjects beyond periphery far outstripped those attempting to analyze him now.  I encourage anyone one thus interested to watch this splendid DVD, then read the works of Jefferson and do your own due diligence in the interpretation.  To read those words, the Library of America has put them together in a book entitled simply ""Jefferson writings"".Jefferson's words carry the weight of worthy quotes in almost every sentence.  As you hear them, one is struck by how thoroughly he was able to explain himself in such succinct verbosity.  He was forever true to his self-described ""blessing of an honest heart"" and to those who exacted promise of him; he never married again after the death of his wife after making such promise; and only once more was he tempted to try to mend his sore heart - this while he was in France, in the persona of an unavailable married woman who intrigued him by wit and beauty.  The dialog he wrote in anguish - a conversation between ""Head"" and ""Heart"" - when torn asunder yet again by the loss of something that had visited but could not stay, is beyond my own words to suitably describe.  Once more, he got through a personal struggle by writing of it; getting  it out on paper.  The Head won, as it always must for Jefferson, because there was no other true choice.  A man may, indeed be amazing in several areas and during a time or two in his life, but for this man there seemed to be no end to what his mind was capable of solving; and the singular talent to be able to  express what he felt - and what others could benefit from - in few but powerful words.  From the Declaration of Independence, written in just a few days in a solitary room in Philadelphia, to the seemingly impossible task of bringing churchmen to heel when persuading each of them that religion must never enter American politics, to the Louisiana purchase accomplishment which doubled the size of our national real estate, his own quasar from within flowed like liquid mercury from his pen, and was always ""self evident.""  He was possessed of something more than genius, for genius is sometimes so directed that other things can never come to be for those who have it - but he was equally blessed by a vast amount of common sense directing it.  Common sense possessed by one so brilliant is, perhaps, another quality not usually found as abundantly in other brilliant men.Thomas Jefferson was a scientist in the truest sense of the word.  Every thing he saw or felt, he analyzed.  His life itself was one vast experiment; even his grief was dealt with through self-analysis when he managed to talk him self through unimaginable and continual personal sorrow, complicated by the great political responsibility that rested on his shoulders during those times.  Everything was critical; nothing could wait while tragedy resolved - he somehow dealt with it all through finding his own strength, possibly by writing it out as he grieved.  Thomas Jefferson was one of the ""solitaires"" of American strength and intellect, no doubt, and perhaps of anywhere, in any time.This film deals beautifully with all of it.  I somehow felt the comments made by Gore Vidal were some of the most insightful, and captures the imagination.  But I note one curiosity that seems to be present in virtually all films that deal with powerful men and the issue of slavery - much is made often of THAT, and the fact that Jefferson didn't see fit to free his slaves after penning the ""all created equal"" Declaration, but little if any mention is made of the virtual ""enslavement"" of women during that same period.  Not only were they simply the ""wives of men"", but neither Mrs. Washington, Mrs. Jefferson, nor Mrs. Adams, nor any of their sex could VOTE for the men they so esteemed, and promised to ""love, honor and OBEY"".  They could speak within the confines of their homes; they may even be taken into the confidence and give private opinions to great men, perhaps even influence a political decision or two, but that was as far as was permitted.  They may have resided within the larger abode, but their personal limitations were very similar to the people living in the quarters.As a matter of fact, it might be successfully argued that the slaves were actually set free long before the women were!",5,""" The Virginian""",1317772800,"10 5, 2011",2011,5981,"['have', 'tried', 'describe', 'degree', 'expression', 'inspiration', 'influence',

The thesis that Gore Vidal voices that Jefferson is the spirit of the American narrative in the flesh - that he is it - is beautifully substantiated by the emphasis on the paradoxes that we can find in Jefferson's life and match those with the same paradoxes in the life of the nation. There is a very nice development of the relationships between Jefferson and his contemporaries - especially Adams. Lots of scenes of Monticello and a wealth of resources gathered from a world of sources all make this a great learning tool and entertaining at the same time.,5,great introduction to Thomas Jefferson,1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,668,"['What', 'great', 'introduction', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'are', 'touches', 'controversies', 'seem', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'thesis', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'Jefferson', 'spirit', 'American', 'narrative', 'flesh', 'beautifully', 'substantiated', 'emphasis', 'paradoxes', 'can', 'find', 'Jefferson', 'life', 'match', 'same', 'paradoxes', 'life', 'nation', 'very', 'nice', 'development', 'relationships', 'Jefferson', 'contemporaries', 'especially', 'Adams', 'Lots', 'scenes', 'Monticello', 'wealth', 'resources', 'gathered', 'world', 'sources', 'make', 'great', 'learning', 'tool', 'entertaining', 'same', 'time']",N/A
