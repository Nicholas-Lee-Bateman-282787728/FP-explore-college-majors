236719,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,6300270475,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[5, 5]","I love the movie SPARKLE and I'm so glad I finally bought the DVD.Named as the precursor and inspiration to the Broadway musicalDreamgirls(and eventually movieDreamgirls (Two-Disc Showstopper Edition)), the film is about a group of friends--three of them sisters--and the different paths their lives take as they deal with life in the Harlem ghetto in the late 50s and 60s.Don't let the cutesy title fool you; SPARKLE is a dark drama about pain and joy, and the nearly impossible task of trying to lift one's life out of poverty. There are some fantastic musical numbers and the dresses are fab, but this is far from the glamorous ""Dreamgirls.""Fantastic songs and score by Curtis Mayfield punctuate the drama on screen and the dark lighting creates a stifling atmosphere that puts the viewer smack dab in the middle of poverty...where the only light shines is on the performer up on the stage.The transfer to DVD is gorgeous! It's about time this cult favorite was released on DVD.It also includes the trailer narrated by Casey Kasem and includes a separate CD from the Aretha Franklin albumSparkle: Music From The Warner Bros. Motion Picture..The bonus CD contains 5 out of the 8 songs that were on the album/CD. Songs not on the bonus are:JUMPI GET HIGHROCK WITH MEOne note about the soundtrack: I really wish they would add the original vocals from the movie (done by Irene Cara, Lonette Mckee and Dawn Smith) to the soundtrack. Don't get me wrong, I love Aretha but the arrangements are so different on some songs that I don't like it.And beside, Cara and Mckee sound wonderful, particularly Cara's solo on ""Precious Lord Take My Hand.""

""brnn64""","[6, 19]","Sorry folks, I know this is considered a 70s classic, but I couldn't get into this one.The story has been described already, so here goes.I saw it when I was 13 (circa 1978-79) and it put me to sleep in the theater. I finally saw the rest of it on DVD this weekend. I didn't miss much.First of all, none of the characters are well-drawn enough to make you feel much sympathy for them. We don't get enough about them to understand why they do what they do. This is especially true of the Lonette McKee character ""Sister,"" who looks pretty, but strikes you as being really shallow and stupid for making the choices that she did.The singing leaves much to be desired. One finds it easy to understand why the record company had Aretha Franklin rerecord the songs for the soundtrack album. Aside from the girls looking cute and showing off some serious pulchritude in the tight dresses, the performances just aren't that compelling.Overall, the tale is quite dreary and almost unrelentigly grim as a whole. Little or no humor (some really cornball stuff from Don ""Bubba"" Bexley as a low-rate MC) or moments to make you smile (other than some of the opening talent show-the guys who sing ""Love potion #9 and the early love scene with Irene Cara & Philip Michael Thomas). This aside, the film is really unappealing except for those who saw it in the 70s and are nostaligic about it.This film has often been considered as a predecessor to ""Dreamgirls."" Such comparisons are valid. In spite of the similar stories, DG succeeds with more zesty and appealing performances and characters, better songs, and a proper mix of drama, music, and comedy.This thing, on the other hand, drags like lead with sappy songs (""Something He Can Feel"" aside) and unrelenting tales of drug addiction, domestic violence, mafia hit men, ghetto poverty, etc. with no comic relief or well-done light moments to balance this. (for example, we never learn what happens to the bitter daughter who leaves home or what caused her to be as angry as she was or why her mother was such a saint under these conditions, etc).No thanks folks. Give me DG any day and use this DVD as a coaster, frisbee, or for target practice. It IS interesting out of curiousity to see soon-to-be's such as a very young Phillip Michael Thomas and Irene Cara going through some early motions and Mary Alice before she was a staple in Black television shows of the 1980s.",1,Sparkle?

But they ultimately find much too late that stardom has its own set of destructive demons that will lay to waste careers and fragile lives.Sister (Lonette McKee), Sparkle (Irene Cara) & Delores (Dwan Smith) are initially billed as Sister and the Sisters, but the DVD title provides you a pretty good tip on who ends up as the most famous of the trio. Philip Michael Thomas (Stix) puts in a solid performance as the love interest of Sparkle.The Curtis Mayfield score and the bonus 5-track CD from Aretha Franklin  easily covers the cost of the set.The story moves swiftly in its 98 minutes and tackles issues like racism, sexism and chemical & physical abuse from a female perspective. And let's be real, the pressures on women in the recording industry are intense; look to a survivor like Mary J. to get that true picture.A planned remake has had its own real-life tragedy. The death of Aaliyah (slated to play Sparkle) in 2001 postponed production plans. The project was shelved around 2003, though Raven Symone was scheduled to play the lead role.From being the inspiration for the 1981 Broadway musical Dreamgirls, to finally making it to DVD due to the success of the movie Dreamgirls, it appears that Sparkle - though it came first - will remain somehow linked with the stage & screen projects it helped create.",5,A Lost Gem Is Found,1171324800,"02 13, 2007",2007,1636,"['going', 'music', 'store', 'flipping', 'used', 'CD', 'rack', 'finding', 'unopened', 'classic', 'wanted', 'years', 'had', 'forgotten', 'see', 'it.Sparkle', 'was', 'released', '1976', 'chronicles', 'how', 'three', 'sisters', 'defeat', 'long', 'odds', 'living', '1950s', 'America', 'become', 'overnight', 'music', 'sensation', 'ultimately', 'find', 'much', 'too', 'late', 'stardom', 'own', 'set', 'destructive', 'demons', 'will', 'lay', 'waste', 'careers', 'fragile', 'lives.Sister', 'Lonette', 'McKee', 'Sparkle', 'Irene', 'Cara', 'Delores', 'Dwan', 'Smith', 'are', 'initially', 'billed', 'Sister', 'Sisters', 'DVD', 'title', 'pretty', 'good', 'tip', 'who', 'up', 'most', 'famous', 'trio', 'Philip', 'Michael', 'Thomas', 'Stix', 'solid', 'performance', 'love', 'interest', 'Sparkle.The', 'Curtis', 'Mayfield', 'score', 'bonus', '5-track', 'CD', 'Aretha', 'Franklin', 'easily', 'cost', 'set.The', 'story', 'moves', 'swiftly', '98', 'minutes', 'tackles', 'issues', 'racism', 'sexism', 'chemical', 'physical', 'abuse', 'female', 'perspective', 'let', 'be', 'real', 'pressures', 'women', 'recording', 'industry', 'are', 'intense', 'look', 'survivor', 'Mary', 'J.', 'get', 'true', 'picture.A', 'planned', 'remake', 'had', 'own', 'real-life', 'tragedy', 'death', 'Aaliyah', 'slated', 'play', 'Sparkle', '2001', 'postponed', 'production', 'plans', 'project', 'was', 'shelved', '2003', 'Raven', 'Symone', 'was', 'scheduled', 'play', 'lead', 'role.From', 'being', 'inspiration', '1981', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'Dreamgirls', 'finally', 'making', 'DVD', 'due', 'success', 'movie', 'Dreamgirls', 'Sparkle', 'came', 'first', 'will', 'remain', 'somehow', 'linked', 'stage', 'screen', 'projects', 'helped', 'create']",N/A

I can't believe someone as boring as her ended up being the star of the movie.  I just got tired of the goody-two shoes personality.

The performances were tremendous - great singing, acting, and dancing on stage.  The film showed the positive, as well as dark side, of show business in Harlem and the corrupt influences and downfalls of that environment. This film is set in another time - in the early days of the Black show groups of the 50's and 60's.  This showed the good, the bad and the ugly of that scene and the aspirations of the young folks from poor backgrounds trying to break into the music business and be successful.  On the down side, the movie's plot development only took you so far and the ending came too soon and abruptly - leaving the viewer wanting more.  It left us yearning for a ""Sparkle 2"" to fill in the story blanks and complete the journey.  For that reason, I deducted a star.  Really enjoyed the innocence and hope of that era portrayed in the film and I felt for the dreams and aspirations of the young people yearning for a break in life.  The music and entertainment was great - they sure don't make songs like that anymore.

Her new group, Hot Caramel sounds like a force to be reckoned with, and I just saw this movie for the first time yesterday on Ovation.  I didn't like Dream Girls, but I totally LOVED Sparkle.  People call it campy and, well, yeah, it is, but I've seen campy films I don't enjoy at all (Sgt. Pepper with the BeeGees and Frampton comes to mind).  If you like Dream Girls, great, but this movie came out a lot earlier and is 20 times better than anything with Beyonce' Knowles (who can't act, try though she might), and Jennifer Hudson who annoyingly overdoes all her vocals.  (Give me Queen Latifah's Dana Owens albums any day!)Though Irene was the young, upcoming star to watch in this film and her pipes are righteous, it is Lonette McKee who steals the show as the troubled by drugs and a bad man, Sister.  I have seen people like Sister with so much potential reach a similarly terrible end, even in the small Wisconsin county I hail from, so the story is timeless in its own right, period piece aside.  Also noteworthy is Sparkle's boyfriend Stix, played by a somewhat younger Philip Michael Thomas who went on to be a huge TV star in Miami Vice.The best song on the soundtrack is inarguably ""Giving Him Something He Can Feel,"" later covered quite faithfully by En Vogue.  Most of the musical numbers are quite good, but the thing that makes this movie stand out most is the performances by the entire cast.  They show a realism and darkness to the Harlem of the 50s, and yet a determination to move beyond its restraints.  Kitschy or not, I love everything about this movie from the cast, to the costumes, to the well-written and performed musical numbers.

When that year can and went, I figured 2006 would be the year of release for the movie's 30th year anniversary.  Oh well, at least the DVD is finally being released.The release of this movie in 1976 was a big deal in Detroit, because it was the movie debut of Detroit native Lonette McKee.  She even attended the Detroit premiere!  Her reviews were great, and she had appearances on many talk shows afterwards--including Dinah Shore's.  On one show, she expressed disappointment that an album featuring the songs as sung by her, Irene Cara, and others in the movie wasn't released, but thanked Aretha Franklin for recording an album featuring the songs from the film.  She was later cast as Ali's wife in the movie 'The Greatest', but later quit after creative differences with the director.  She was then cast as one of the female co-stars in the hilarious 1977 movie 'Which Way Is Up?' with Richard Pryor (who had taken McKee under his wing and who she was rumored to have been dating).  Her next big movie role was in 'The Cotton Club' in 1984, where she played a Cotton Club girl who later passes for white to get gigs in higher-paying clubs.  Other roles include Haley's tv movie 'Queen' (where she played a slave who passes for white) and Oprah Winfrey's tv movie 'The Women of Brewster Place' (where she played a lesbian school teacher fearful of losing her job if her sexuality became known).Back to 'Sparkle'...One of my all-time favorite movie characters is the tall, sexy, strutting, long-haired, high-yellow, gum-chewing, I'm-hot-and-I-know-it Sister!  McKee owns the movie, and the three girls in red dresses singing ""Hooked On Your Love"" is a screen classic!  Irene Cara is the perfect choice for the sweet, innocent Sparkle.  Many often joke about pretty Dwan Smith's Delores character--mainly because she looks so unlike her supposed sisters in the film (""she was adopted""...""Effie had an affair with a black man when Delores was conceived"").  But she is great as the tough, proud middle sister.  Then there's Tony King as the villian Satin, and Philip Michael Thomas as the good guy Stix. (Hmmm...should I address the color complexion issue?  How the lightest of the girls is considered the ""prettiest girl in Harlem"", how the darkest guy is the evil bad guy, and how...no, forget it!

Released five years before the Broadway opening of ""Dreamgirls"" and partially set in the same period, it has a predominantly black cast and a story revolving around an up-and-coming girl group, and that's where the resemblance basically ends. Written by Joel Schumacher well before he became a big-league director of mainstream studio product (""Batman Forever"", ""The Phantom of the Opera""), this movie seems grittier on the surface. True to form, however, Schumacher weakens the storyline and character development by injecting an abundance of clich&eacute;s and eye-rolling one-liners. With little affinity for staging musical numbers, Sam O'Steen, a highly regarded film editor but neophyte director, helms the production like a low-budget TV-movie with a frustratingly episodic structure.The story follows three Harlem sisters - sexy Sister, self-righteous Delores and sweet Sparkle - as they sing in the church choir, meet smooth-talking but well-intentioned boys Stix and Levi, and then find their first taste of success as a singing group - first as a sweater-wearing quintet called the Hearts and then as a glitzy trio known as Sister and the Sisters. But naturally there are problems beyond the silly name for the group - Sister gets involved with nasty drug dealer Satin Struthers who beats her and turns her into a cocaine junkie; Levi goes to prison for getting caught in a drug pick-up for Satin; Stix gets frustrated by failure and unwisely turns to some Jewish mobsters for financial help; Delores just gets plain fed up; and poor little Sparkle has to decide what kind of future she wants. A big plus is that R&B; great Curtis Mayfield wrote the atmospheric songs, some catchy and one, ""Look Into Your Heart"", a real winner.The solid cast does its best under the contrived circumstances. Lonette McKee's valiant attempt to make Sister a tragic figure is undercut by some of the ham-fisted plot turns, including a sad Billie Holliday-like turn at the mike. Before they hit it big on primetime TV, Philip Michael Thomas and Dorian Harewood portray Stix and Levi with boyish vitality if not much credibility. The best work comes from Mary Alice in a relatively silent turn as the girls' patient mother and a pre-""Fame"" Irene Cara who effortlessly exudes sincerity in the title role (though her costumer and hair stylist should be shot for the hideous look she achieves in the final scene). The DVD just comes with the original theatrical trailer complete with an unctuous voiceover by DJ Casey Kasem and a bonus CD of five of the film's songs performed not by the original cast but by Aretha Franklin off her 1976 recording of the soundtrack. It's not a terrible movie, just an interesting if lacking curio that happens to cover the same ground as ""Dreamgirls"".",3,"Low-Budget, Pre-""Dreamgirls"" Curio Has Some Good Moments and Mayfield's Music...But It's Not Nearly Enough",1168041600,"01 6, 2007",2007,2976,"['Just', 'time', 'capitalize', 'long-awaited', 'movie', 'version', 'Dreamgirls', 'DVD', 'release', 'semi-forgotten', '1976', 'musical', 'melodrama', 'also', 'rise', 'Supremes', 'inspiration', 'Released', 'five', 'years', 'Broadway', 'opening', 'Dreamgirls', 'partially', 'set', 'same', 'period', 'predominantly', 'black', 'cast', 'story', 'revolving', 'up-and-coming', 'girl', 'group', 'where', 'resemblance', 'basically', 'Written', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'well', 'became', 'big-league', 'director', 'mainstream', 'studio', 'product', 'Batman', 'Forever', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'movie', 'grittier', 'surface', 'True', 'form', 'however', 'Schumacher', 'storyline', 'character', 'development', 'injecting', 'abundance', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'eye-rolling', 'one-liners', 'little', 'affinity', 'staging', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Sam', ""O'Steen"", 'highly', 'regarded', 'film', 'editor', 'neophyte', 'director', 'helms', 'production', 'low-budget', 'TV-movie', 'frustratingly', 'episodic', 'structure.The', 'story', 'three', 'Harlem', 'sisters', 'sexy', 'Sister', 'self-righteous', 'Delores', 'sweet', 'Sparkle', 'sing', 'church', 'choir', 'meet', 'smooth-talking', 'well-intentioned', 'boys', 'Stix', 'Levi', 'then', 'find', 'first', 'taste', 'success', 'singing', 'group', 'first', 'sweater-wearing', 'quintet', 'called', 'Hearts', 'then', 'glitzy', 'trio', 'known', 'Sister', 'Sisters', 'naturally', 'are', 'problems', 'silly', 'name', 'group', 'Sister', 'involved', 'nasty', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Satin', 'Struthers', 'who', 'cocaine', 'junkie', 'Levi', 'prison', 'getting', 'caught', 'drug', 'pick-up', 'Satin', 'Stix', 'frustrated', 'failure', 'unwisely', 'Jewish', 'mobsters', 'financial', 'help', 'just', 'plain', 'fed', 'up', 'poor', 'little', 'Sparkle', 'decide', 'what', 'kind', 'future', 'big', 'plus', 'R', 'B', 'great', 'Curtis', 'Mayfield', 'wrote', 'atmospheric', 'songs', 'catchy', 'one', 'Look', 'Into', 'Your', 'Heart', 'real', 'winner.The', 'solid', 'cast', 'best', 'contrived', 'circumstances', 'Lonette', 'McKee', 'valiant', 'attempt', 'make', 'Sister', 'tragic', 'figure', 'undercut', 'ham-fisted', 'plot', 'turns', 'including', 'sad', 'Billie', 'Holliday-like', 'turn', 'mike', 'hit', 'big', 'primetime', 'TV', 'Philip', 'Michael', 'Thomas', 'Dorian', 'Harewood', 'portray', 'Stix', 'Levi', 'boyish', 'vitality', 'not', 'much', 'credibility', 'best', 'work', 'Mary', 'Alice', 'relatively', 'silent', 'turn', 'girls', 'patient', 'mother', 'pre-', 'Fame', 'Irene', 'Cara', 'who', 'effortlessly', 'sincerity', 'title', 'role', 'costumer', 'hair', 'stylist', 'should', 'be', 'shot', 'hideous', 'look', 'final', 'scene', 'DVD', 'just', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'complete', 'unctuous', 'voiceover', 'DJ', 'Casey', 'Kasem', 'bonus', 'CD', 'five', 'film', 'songs', 'performed', 'not', 'original', 'cast', 'Aretha', 'Franklin', '1976', 'recording', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'just', 'interesting', 'lacking', 'curio', 'cover', 'same', 'ground', 'Dreamgirls']",N/A

236771,A1R75W42LUUPO9,6300270475,K.,"[5, 6]","Shot in 1975 and released in April 1976, ""Sparkle"" is a film about a trio of sisters from 1950s/1960s Harlem who form a Supremes-esque singing group. Having never seen ""Sparkle"", but having heard my fellow Black folks praise it left and right, I had high expectations for it. The film itself, ironically, isn't much to sing about; while better than most of the blaxploitation films released at the time, that's honestly not saying much. Despite strong performances by Lonnette McKee and Irene Cara, and a good one from Philip Michael ""Miami Vice"" Thomas, ""Sparkle"" is hampered with a weak script from Joel Schumacher; virtually every line of dialogue is cringe-worthy. The songs by Curtis Mayfield are all wonderful, to the point where I don't mind that they're, for the most part, deeply rooted in Mayfield's early-1970s style, and some of them, especially ""Jump"", are therefore anachronistic. The film's best-known song, ""Something He Can Feel"" (later resurrected in girl-group fashion by En Vogue) comes closest to fitting into the period. A period-appropriate cover of Gladys Knight & the Pips' 1964 minor hit ""Giving Up"" (later covered by Donny Hathaway) is welcome among Mayfield compositions such as ""Hooked on Your Love"" and ""Look Into Your Heart""I can't call ""Sparkle"" a well-made film, but I can call it a likable and entertaining one. By contrast, a lot of well-made films are cold and unentertaining, calling the whole debate of ""art or entertainment"" into play.""Sparkle"" hasn't been available on home video in over a decade, and although this new DVD set fulfills the basic requirement of making the film available, it falters in every other way imaginable. Although the artwork above leads one to believe this release is a 2-disc DVD set (and, as such, containing plenty of special features), the release is actually a bare-bones DVD with a bonus CD. The film itself is presented on the DVD in a decent, and obviously new, anamorphic widescreen DVD transfer, which is good. However, the soundtrack is only available in its original mono version, which is - characteristically for a film shot in 1975 - damp. Perhaps the separate tracks no longer exist to allow ""Sparkle"" to be remixed into stereo as 20th Century Fox did for ""Claudine"", but if possible, it would have been nice.There are no bonus features, save for the film's original theatrical trailer, narrated by, of all people, Casey Kasem. One would think the bonus CD would be the Aretha Franklin soundtrack album (as was done for ""School Daze"", which got much better treatment on its recent DVD release), but it's not quite. Three songs are missing: ""Jump"", 'I Get High"", and ""Rock with Me"". I presume Warner wants you to buy the soundtrack album, but they must not realize that most people - myself included - are going to head over to iTunes and spend an extra $2.97 for the missing three songs. Surely it wouldn't have been too much trouble to include three more songs, would it?And Warner Bros. makes no pretense about the fact that this DVD release was done primarily to cash in on the release and success of the film version ""Dreamgirls"", which they were originally to have co-produced. A sticker on the box proclaims ""Before 'Dreamgirls', there was 'Sparkle'"".

Boki""","[1, 1]","The wildly successful Tony-award winning musical, ""Dreamgirls"" is possibly the most infamous of entertainment properties about The Supremes, but, is not upfront that it's  indeed based on the essence of The Supremes (especially, the movie which does at least pay homage to Berry Gordy after it shifts locations from the Chicago of the musical to home of The Supremes, Detroit. As well as, actually creating mock album covers stolent directly from their famous Motown album covers). ""Sparkle"", the 1976 or the 2012 version of the film, is yet another example of a story based on the essence of The Supremes, without paying credit to them. The Supremes image of three glamorous women in gowns have practically been trademarked as being of The Supremes. Both entertainment endeavors fail to utilize any Motown music, though the music they use is clearly influenced by the Motown sound on many of the songs. In fact, the Broadway version of ""Love, Valour and Compassion"" features a major character who loves The Supremes. The original Supremes music was used in the musical. However, when it was time to make the movie version of ""Love, Valour and Compassion"", the original Motown music was eliminated. That may well speak to the unconfirmed fact that Motown music is very expensive to license. That could be the reason that a Motown musical has yet to be produced on broadway, though it now seems closer than ever.""Sparkle"" does have the incredible talents of Lonetta McKee, Irene Cara and the wondrous Mary Alice. Though Lonetta and Irene perform very capable versions of the movie's songs, by the time the Curtis Mayfield produced soundtrack became a million selling pseudo soundtrack for Aretha. (I still would love to have a soundtrack with the original cast). Lonetta plays ""sister"" as the fabled Florence Ballard character, with the original lead vocals undermined by a tragic drug habit. Florence Ballard supposedly had a drinking problem. And like Florence, the ""Sister"" character dies tragically. Irene Cara's role is less influenced by Diana Ross though she is beautiful with model looks and solid vocals. And she becomes wildly successful possibly similar to Diana. Mary Alice's character could have been based on Ernestine Ross, Diana's mother, who often chaperoned The Supremes on the road.Curtis Mayfield's soundtrack is a winner in its own right. However, it would have been interesting to hear the Motown songs instead.Ultimately, the movie works as casual entertainment and cannot be taken completely serious because of its disingenuous nature. The forthcoming 2012 version with Whitney Houston will provide yet another twist on the storyline. Let's hope that the 2012 has a degree of higher integrity.",4,"Sparkle is not Supreme nor Does it Sparkle, BUT it is Worth Seeing",1342051200,"07 12, 2012",2012,2716,"['wildly', 'successful', 'Tony-award', 'winning', 'musical', 'Dreamgirls', 'possibly', 'most', 'infamous', 'entertainment', 'properties', 'Supremes', 'not', 'upfront', 'indeed', 'based', 'essence', 'Supremes', 'especially', 'movie', 'least', 'pay', 'homage', 'Berry', 'Gordy', 'shifts', 'locations', 'Chicago', 'musical', 'home', 'Supremes', 'Detroit', 'As', 'well', 'actually', 'creating', 'mock', 'album', 'stolent', 'directly', 'famous', 'Motown', 'album', 'Sparkle', '1976', '2012', 'version', 'film', 'yet', 'example', 'story', 'based', 'essence', 'Supremes', 'paying', 'credit', 'Supremes', 'image', 'three', 'glamorous', 'women', 'gowns', 'have', 'practically', 'been', 'trademarked', 'being', 'Supremes', 'entertainment', 'endeavors', 'fail', 'utilize', 'Motown', 'music', 'music', 'use', 'clearly', 'influenced', 'Motown', 'sound', 'many', 'songs', 'fact', 'Broadway', 'version', 'Love', 'Valour', 'Compassion', 'major', 'character', 'who', 'Supremes', 'original', 'Supremes', 'music', 'was', 'used', 'musical', 'However', 'when', 'was', 'time', 'make', 'movie', 'version', 'Love', 'Valour', 'Compassion', 'original', 'Motown', 'music', 'was', 'eliminated', 'may', 'well', 'speak', 'unconfirmed', 'fact', 'Motown', 'music', 'very', 'expensive', 'license', 'could', 'be', 'reason', 'Motown', 'musical', 'yet', 'be', 'produced', 'broadway', 'now', 'closer', 'ever', 'Sparkle', 'have', 'incredible', 'talents', 'Lonetta', 'McKee', 'Irene', 'Cara', 'wondrous', 'Mary', 'Alice', 'Though', 'Lonetta', 'Irene', 'perform', 'very', 'capable', 'versions', 'movie', 'songs', 'time', 'Curtis', 'Mayfield', 'produced', 'soundtrack', 'became', 'million', 'selling', 'pseudo', 'soundtrack', 'Aretha', 'still', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'soundtrack', 'original', 'cast', 'Lonetta', 'sister', 'fabled', 'Florence', 'Ballard', 'character', 'original', 'lead', 'vocals', 'undermined', 'tragic', 'drug', 'habit', 'Florence', 'Ballard', 'supposedly', 'had', 'drinking', 'problem', 'Florence', 'Sister', 'character', 'tragically', 'Irene', 'Cara', 'role', 'less', 'influenced', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'beautiful', 'model', 'looks', 'solid', 'vocals', 'wildly', 'successful', 'possibly', 'similar', 'Diana', 'Mary', 'Alice', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'Ernestine', 'Ross', 'Diana', 'mother', 'who', 'often', 'chaperoned', 'Supremes', 'road.Curtis', 'Mayfield', 'soundtrack', 'winner', 'own', 'right', 'However', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'hear', 'Motown', 'songs', 'instead.Ultimately', 'movie', 'casual', 'entertainment', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'completely', 'serious', 'disingenuous', 'nature', 'forthcoming', '2012', 'version', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'will', 'provide', 'yet', 'twist', 'storyline', 'Let', 'hope', '2012', 'degree', 'higher', 'integrity']",N/A

Today I was afforded the opportunity to do just that, and I watched it in its entirety.  I enjoyed the movie.  As soon as it went off, I told my mother, ""I liked it!""""Sparkle"" tells the story of three sisters with the gift of song.  As their fame elevates, problems arise.  Some are introduced to men, drugs, abuse, snakes in the entertainment industry and a host of other malicious things.  The sister who is ironically nicknamed ""Sister"" has the most tragic story of them all.  She finds love (or so she thinks) in Satin, a man who wanted her from the first time he set eyes on her.  Once they were an item, Sister's demise began.  She got into drugs, started getting abused and missed some of the concerts.  Delores sees the stress of being remotely famous and abruptly leaves the scene for good.  But, then there is sweet Sparkle.  Sparkle endured so much, yet, in the end, she did what she had set out to do, be a famous singer and perform a concert at Carnegie Hall.  She and her object of affection, Stix, also remain together throughout the entire movie.""Sparkle"" is an overall good movie, but it has some missteps.  For example, the movie is low-budget, and it is not difficult for the viewer to realize that.  Throughout the film, there is a certain darkness.  I'm not sure if that was intentional, but it gives the movie an eerie feel.  Also, the acting was far from stellar.  There are certain scenes where the actors looked forced as opposed to the naturalness that an actor is supposed to have.  The scenes were just thrown at the viewer, also.  The story development is not good.So, what made the movie the African-American classic that it is? Well, for one, the sisters are some of the most attractive women ever to grace a screen.  The pulchritude those women brought to the film is almost surreal.  And the music!  Curtis Mayfield composed some wonderful music for this movie.  Many of these songs would later be redone by others.  Most notable and memorable for me, though, are the two songs En Vogue included on their sophomore album, ""Funky Divas.""  They did excellent renditions of ""Hooked on Your Love (one of my favorite songs ever!) and ""Giving Him Something He Can Feel.""The DVD version of ""Sparkle"" is alright at best.  The sound is sup-par, and the bonus disc includes five songs from the soundtrack.  If you were to purchase this DVD, you would buy it because you want the movie in your collection, not because it has great bonus features.  The only bonus included (besides some songs from the soundtrack, performed by Aretha Franklin), is the movie's trailer.  I recommend this movie.

Sparkle was about, and made with, unbroken gritty realism, as a film of the early 1970s (think The French Connection)...which makes the glamour and polish of the musical numbers even more effective.  Lonette McKee is a mesmerizing performer; smooth and sensuous onstage; either in relaxed command or intense to the point of intimidating, offstage.  (No one bursts into song offstage.)  Irene Cara matures subtly from a timid teenager backing up her stunning and confident elder sister into a poised and accomplished star in her own right.  Philip Michael Thomas gets to show more life than he ever did later on Miami Vice.  Dorian Harewood nails a tricky role with the early talent that caught Stanley Kubrick's notice for Full Metal Jacket.As a middle-aged suburban classical-music lover, I'm not certain whether Curtis Mayfield's songs are too far ahead of the period, but they're so good you won't care.The direction is pointed with well-chosen details:  a scene opens on a shot of Satin's two-tone wingtips...at a cockfight; a nightspot favored by African-Americans has an overdressed platinum blonde who, like her dog, never speaks but never leaves; the singing trio's mother, smooth-tempered and congenial no matter WHAT goes down, watches proudly from the wings of Carnegie Hall, against a background of stage electricians working their enormous circuit boards...My wife vaguely remembered the film's release, and this particular evening had counted on watching something else...but thanked me for this.

Normally I would'nt find fault in the extra disc, but I just hated the fact that the original soundtrack does not include the songs being sung by the girls in the movie. When I first hear a song I enjoy there is an instant connection to the person who sings it. When I heard Lonnette McKee sing Hooked on your Love or Irene Cara sing Look into your Heart, these are the singers who I want to hear on the soundtrack not Aretha Franklin!!!Eventhough Aretha is the Queen of Soul she did'nt sing those songs in the movie, and therefore did not make them her own!!!Despite a few flaws in the dvd release of Sparkle, I did really enjoy seeing this 70's classic!!!

The characters were disappointing in that the women (except for the mother) were weak and easily manipulated by the men in their lives and/or their dreams of being successful singing stars.  The mother was ill used by the daughters, except for Sparkle.  To watch one's mother work herself (respectfully) to the bone to support her children (alone) and bring them up with some sense of pride, respect and confidence in and for themselves. She never confronted them on their behavior.  Sparkle was the only one that seem to understand the sacrifices her mother had made for all of them.  I do like Irene Cara and many of the other actors, however, I think the writing (script) was not up to their talents. Similar movies based on the 50's-70's pop groups, have been much more entertaining.  So this one is &#34;ok&#34; and since I own it, I will watch it again, sometime; but am more apt to watch, &#34;Dream Girls&#34;, &#34;The Temptations&#34; or &#34;Five Heartbeats&#34; numerous times (which I already have).  I gave it 4 stars, because the acting was good; but they weren't given enough to work with.  Of course, and as always, this is just my opinion and you should check it out for yourself.",4,"Acting is good, script, uh!",1387152000,"12 16, 2013",2013,1337,"['interesting', 'story', 'line', 'seem', 'have', 'bases', 'truth', 'however', 'musical', 'felt', 'just', ""was't"", 'enough', 'music', 'characters', 'were', 'disappointing', 'women', 'mother', 'were', 'weak', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'men', 'lives', 'and/or', 'dreams', 'being', 'successful', 'singing', 'stars', 'mother', 'was', 'ill', 'used', 'daughters', 'Sparkle', 'watch', 'one', 'mother', 'work', 'respectfully', 'bone', 'support', 'children', 'alone', 'bring', 'up', 'sense', 'pride', 'respect', 'confidence', 'never', 'confronted', 'behavior', 'Sparkle', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'seem', 'understand', 'sacrifices', 'mother', 'had', 'made', 'do', 'Irene', 'Cara', 'many', 'other', 'actors', 'however', 'think', 'writing', 'script', 'was', 'not', 'up', 'talents', 'Similar', 'movies', 'based', ""50's-70"", 'pop', 'groups', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'So', 'one', '34', '34', 'own', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'sometime', 'am', 'more', 'apt', 'watch', '34', 'Dream', 'Girls', '34', '34', 'Temptations', '34', '34', 'Five', 'Heartbeats', '34', 'numerous', 'times', 'already', 'have', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'were', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'work', 'course', 'always', 'just', 'opinion', 'should', 'check', 'out']",N/A
