988317,A2SP2LGE4NCYMR,B000FDEV3Y,"Arne Andersen ""Arne Blaze""","[4, 6]","The 21 year old Johnny Depp appears here as one of two teens on the make at a Florida resort hotel - their only wish is to get laid.  Complications ensue. Nothing new here - situations evolve out of classic farce and slapstick encounters.  Both Rob Morrow and Depp expose their butts in a few sequences and there are more exposed women's breasts than in any other commercially released film I've seen.  There is the inept jewel thief, the lecherous waiter with designs on the sweet young waitress and a dotty matron.Morrow manages to be obnoxious and Depp merely cute. He isn't called upon to create a character here - it was after all his first leading film role and only his second film appearance.There are a few continuity errors probably due to editing decisions but only one stands out (Depp manages to bed his girl but we don't see anything of the encounter the night before, only waking up the morning after).Tony Azito and Hector Aleandro are amusing as the frustrated security director and the jewel thief, but the film is stolen by Dody Goodman as the dotty matron.  Watching her throw herself at a barber in the bushes after accidentally downing a handful of quualudes and attempting to thwart the theft of her diamond with a number of karate moves bring the only real laughs in the film.To summarize, an amusing teen age sex farce with lots of exposed skin, but nothing more.",2,Amusing teen age sex farce,1194739200,"11 11, 2007",2007,1388,"['21', 'year', 'old', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'here', 'one', 'two', 'teens', 'make', 'Florida', 'resort', 'hotel', 'only', 'wish', 'get', 'laid', 'Complications', 'ensue', 'Nothing', 'new', 'here', 'situations', 'evolve', 'classic', 'farce', 'slapstick', 'encounters', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'Depp', 'expose', 'butts', 'few', 'sequences', 'are', 'more', 'exposed', 'women', 'breasts', 'other', 'commercially', 'released', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'inept', 'jewel', 'thief', 'lecherous', 'waiter', 'designs', 'sweet', 'young', 'waitress', 'dotty', 'matron.Morrow', 'manages', 'be', 'obnoxious', 'Depp', 'merely', 'cute', ""n't"", 'called', 'upon', 'create', 'character', 'here', 'was', 'first', 'leading', 'film', 'role', 'only', 'second', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'continuity', 'errors', 'probably', 'due', 'editing', 'decisions', 'only', 'one', 'out', 'Depp', 'bed', 'girl', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'encounter', 'night', 'only', 'waking', 'up', 'morning', '.Tony', 'Azito', 'Hector', 'Aleandro', 'are', 'amusing', 'frustrated', 'security', 'director', 'jewel', 'thief', 'film', 'stolen', 'Dody', 'Goodman', 'dotty', 'matron', 'Watching', 'throw', 'barber', 'bushes', 'accidentally', 'downing', 'handful', 'quualudes', 'attempting', 'thwart', 'theft', 'diamond', 'number', 'karate', 'moves', 'bring', 'only', 'real', 'laughs', 'film.To', 'summarize', 'amusing', 'teen', 'age', 'sex', 'farce', 'lots', 'exposed', 'skin', 'nothing', 'more']",N/A

It's Florida, it's spring break, and what do you need with an actual plot? It's basically slapstick and worse, in terms of humor. For example, one big deal is made over a guy whose hair is ""ruined"" by Depp's roommate pretending to be a barber when he is not. Through all the slapstick foolishness, all I could think of was ""What's his problem? Yul Brenner looked great with no hair at all. Just shave off what's left and stop crabbing.""
