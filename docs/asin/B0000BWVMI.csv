771536,A1XGPPFDFUVW25,B0000BWVMI,Eric Moore,"[2, 4]","I agree with some of the other reviews, that this production was not as good as the first one. It is hard to understand why Hollywood does this either on the big or small screen. Never the less, it happens and we learn to deal with it. In this case of The Music Man remake, I see a lot of improvments that was not attainable in the mid, to late 60's. The cinimatography is much better as well as styles and form of the dance numbers. I fell that if the director could use wide screen then we would see it in a whole new light.  THe numbers were just too big to squeeze them on the small screen. THat is why you see the camera looking down or at an angle at the dance numbers. Some were just to big to get on a 1:33 size screen. Other shots where the extra dancers are in the background dancing, then off to the side. If we could take the classic and the remake ""shuffle"" them like a deck of cards, and then we would have a far superior musical. I mean, take the remix on the new soundtrack, on and put it on the classic. THe classic sound trackis good but you can tell where the music starts and the diolag starts. Wide screen wide screen, as stated earlier that the musical numbers are far too big to have them on 4:3 size. I fell that it is a toss up between the number ""Shipoppie"" of the classic and the new one. However the classic number was a smidge better. The ""Pick-a-Little, Talk-a- Little"" number in the new one was better then the one on the classic. THe ""YOU got Trouble"" song on the classic was better then the new one. I loved the ""Good Night My Someone"" a smidge better then the one in the classic.I agree with the another reviewer that Kristen Chenoweth was stunning. The camera loved her and she is a very very pretty woman. I feel that her performance out did Jones' by just a hair. That said, I feel that Chenoweth could have been in the classic and Jones in the new one. Robert Preston is master for the Prefessor Hill. I dont think that no body could replace him.  It was like the role was written for him and him alone. I would be neat to see the chimistry between Preston and Chenoweth in those roles. Broderick was good but not like Preston. The role of Winthrop, that is a tuffy.  The Professor, Marion, Momma, and Winthrorp are the central main charictors. They are the nuts and bolts of the story line. THe chimestry and reaction between them are vital for a great Music Man! I feel that the kid that played Winthrop was awsome.  Ron Howard was good, but this little kid sparkled!!! He brought Winthrop's charictor in different directions, where I was amazed!  So, replace Howard with the new Winthrop. Sorry dont know his name, and sorry Howard.The classic should have lost the ""play"" look to it.  Meaning that when the scenes changed the light would go out and then go back up to revieal a new scene, the next scene, etc. I have both films and I sometimes switch back and forth and look at the same songs that have different dance number versions.As a whole, the classic is well, a classic. The fresh approach can be for the newer generation, but still holds that magic, ""pied-piper"" storyline. This version may have different dance numbers, some dialog, and scenes, but the sparkle still shines through!!! It is formost a love story that has cool music numbers, period costimes, props, and scenerys. The viewer can be ""tranported"" to a simplier easy way of life. A time where cell phones, T.V., computers, and email address were not even part of the vocabulary. Sound corny, sapy, perhaps. But one cannot deny the time period did happen all the same.Now we can ""relive"" it again and again every time ""The Music Man"" is watched.",5,music to my ears,1106697600,"01 26, 2005",2005,3657,"['agree', 'other', 'reviews', 'production', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'one', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'either', 'big', 'small', 'screen', 'less', 'learn', 'deal', 'case', 'Music', 'Man', 'remake', 'see', 'lot', 'improvments', 'was', 'not', 'attainable', 'mid', 'late', '60', 'cinimatography', 'much', 'better', 'as', 'well', 'styles', 'form', 'dance', 'numbers', 'fell', 'director', 'could', 'use', 'wide', 'screen', 'then', 'would', 'see', 'whole', 'new', 'light', 'THe', 'numbers', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'big', 'squeeze', 'small', 'screen', 'why', 'see', 'camera', 'looking', 'down', 'angle', 'dance', 'numbers', 'were', 'just', 'big', 'get', '1:33', 'size', 'screen', 'Other', 'shots', 'where', 'extra', 'dancers', 'are', 'background', 'dancing', 'then', 'side', 'could', 'take', 'classic', 'remake', 'shuffle', 'deck', 'cards', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'far', 'superior', 'musical', 'mean', 'take', 'remix', 'new', 'soundtrack', 'put', 'classic', 'THe', 'classic', 'sound', 'trackis', 'good', 'can', 'tell', 'where', 'music', 'diolag', 'Wide', 'screen', 'wide', 'screen', 'stated', 'earlier', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'big', 'have', '4:3', 'size', 'fell', 'toss', 'up', 'number', 'Shipoppie', 'classic', 'new', 'one', 'However', 'classic', 'number', 'was', 'smidge', 'better', 'Pick-a-Little', 'Talk-a-', 'Little', 'number', 'new', 'one', 'was', 'better', 'then', 'one', 'classic', 'THe', 'YOU', 'got', 'Trouble', 'song', 'classic', 'was', 'better', 'then', 'new', 'one', 'loved', 'Good', 'Night', 'My', 'Someone', 'smidge', 'better', 'then', 'one', 'classic.I', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'Kristen', 'Chenoweth', 'was', 'stunning', 'camera', 'loved', 'very', 'very', 'pretty', 'woman', 'feel', 'performance', 'did', 'Jones', 'just', 'hair', 'said', 'feel', 'Chenoweth', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'classic', 'Jones', 'new', 'one', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'master', 'Prefessor', 'Hill', 'dont', 'think', 'body', 'could', 'replace', 'was', 'role', 'was', 'written', 'alone', 'would', 'be', 'neat', 'see', 'chimistry', 'Preston', 'Chenoweth', 'roles', 'Broderick', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'Preston', 'role', 'Winthrop', 'tuffy', 'Professor', 'Marion', 'Momma', 'Winthrorp', 'are', 'central', 'main', 'charictors', 'are', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'story', 'line', 'THe', 'chimestry', 'reaction', 'are', 'vital', 'great', 'Music', 'Man', 'feel', 'kid', 'played', 'Winthrop', 'was', 'awsome', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'was', 'good', 'little', 'kid', 'sparkled', 'brought', 'Winthrop', 'charictor', 'different', 'directions', 'where', 'was', 'amazed', 'So', 'replace', 'Howard', 'new', 'Winthrop', 'Sorry', 'dont', 'know', 'name', 'sorry', 'Howard.The', 'classic', 'should', 'have', 'lost', 'play', 'look', 'Meaning', 'when', 'scenes', 'changed', 'light', 'would', 'go', 'out', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'up', 'revieal', 'new', 'scene', 'next', 'scene', 'etc', 'have', 'films', 'sometimes', 'switch', 'back', 'forth', 'look', 'same', 'songs', 'have', 'different', 'dance', 'number', 'whole', 'classic', 'well', 'classic', 'fresh', 'approach', 'can', 'be', 'newer', 'generation', 'still', 'magic', 'pied-piper', 'storyline', 'version', 'may', 'have', 'different', 'dance', 'numbers', 'dialog', 'scenes', 'sparkle', 'still', 'formost', 'love', 'story', 'cool', 'music', 'numbers', 'period', 'costimes', 'props', 'scenerys', 'viewer', 'can', 'be', 'tranported', 'simplier', 'easy', 'way', 'life', 'time', 'where', 'cell', 'phones', 'T.V.', 'computers', 'email', 'address', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'part', 'vocabulary', 'Sound', 'corny', 'sapy', 'perhaps', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'time', 'period', 'did', 'happen', 'same.Now', 'can', 'relive', 'again', 'again', 'time', 'Music', 'Man', 'watched']",N/A

771539,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0000BWVMI,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 4]","It's just about impossible to improve on a classic. The 1962 version ofThe Music Man (Special Edition), for example, is a flat out classic, with such celebrated performances by Shirley Jones as Marian the Librarian and, especially, by Robert Preston as Professor Harold Hill that, for decades, the thought of inserting others in those pivotal roles proved too daunting for the screen. Until 2003, that is, when a made-for-tv remake, titled MEREDITH WILSON'S THE MUSIC MAN, attempted to show that lightning can strike twice. Surprisingly, this remake, on certain levels, succeeds. While not as magical as the original, it's still a delightful musical in its own right. It boasts a lively cast and some truly wonderful singing. While it comes as no surprise that Matthew Broderick is the heart and soul of this film, the gifted Kristin Chenoweth is right there with him, offering very tremendous support.Matthew Broderick has long made it known in certain circles that playing Professor Hill was one of his lifelong acting dreams. So, yeah, he got the gig. As the itinerant con man who fast talks the simple Iowan town of River City into financially investing in a boy's marching band (which would presumably keep the young 'uns on the righteous path), Matthew plays up his slightly skewed charm and his talent for straight faced glibness to full effect. There's always this aura of mild earnestness about Broderick, although one can sense the mischievous twinkle just lurking behind those grave button eyes. The first movie I ever saw him in was FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF and it seems that he's come full circle here as he portrays yet another ingratiating and sympathetic schemer. His  dancing ability may be suspect, but what surprised me when I first saw this was how well Broderick can maneuver himself in the neighborhood of the musical scale. No, he doesn't really unveil any great range, but he does treat his songs kindly.The lovely Kristin Chenoweth not only treats her songs kindly, she tears the roof off the mother (but, classily, with a pinky in the air)! This girl can sing and her talents attach a high level of vocal pedigree to several of this film's musical sequences. My initial viewing of this movie (back when it was aired on tv) was the very first time I've encountered Kristin on the screen, so I wasn't expecting anything, but she blew me away with her awesome renditions of ""Goodnight, My Someone"" and ""Till There Was You,"" although I did find her ""My White Knight"" (which replaced ""Being in Love"" from the 1962 film) to be nap-inducing. But, if given a chance (though opportunities for musical exposure on cinema seem godawful slim), Kristin certainly has what it takes to pave a road to success as a chanteuse. She sings almost as gloriously as Shirley Jones, she does. I will say, however, that Kristin's speaking voice is a bit too thin and reedy for my taste.All the songs but one (the aforementioned ""Being in Love"") are here from the original flick and are done up right. The foursome who play the barbershop quartet may not be the great Buffalo Bills, but they sound terrific as they seamlessly harmonize over ""Sincere,"" ""Goodnight, Ladies"" & ""Lida Rose."" One of my favorite numbers, in fact, is the quartet's medley with Chenowith (""Lida Rose/Will I Ever Tell You""). Present also are the standards ""Iowa Stubborn,"" ""76 Trombones,"" ""The Sadder But Wiser Girl For Me,"" ""Marian the Librarian,"" and, of course, the movie's signature song ""Trouble.""This isn't a negative remark as much as an observation: This version decidedly lacks the energy of the original. Part of that can be attributed to Matthew Broderick, whose forte leans more towards a dry and low key acting style as opposed to Robert Preston's more gregarious and bombastic tendencies. Another factor, too, is the absence of Buddy Hackett, who always seemed to add a manic level to the proceedings. David Aaron Baker as Marcellus is serviceable but isn't nearly as frenetic. As I've said, I don't consider this to be a negative. It actually helps this movie establish a separate identity. As far as Broderick's portrayal of Hill as a more subdued character, I deem this to be a fortuitous move. An actor aping Preston too closely would almost certainly be doomed to even more overt criticism.MEREDITH WILSON'S THE MUSIC MAN, like its predecessor, is a nostalgic slice of Americana, when trains ran the nation, quaint phrases like ""Ye Gods!"" and ""Gonna line yourself up a little canoodling, huh?"" fit right at home, and Chaucer and Balzac were considered to be sinful reading. It must be noted that the villain of this confection is the very good Victor Garber as the River City mayor, and that this type of film caters to such an innocent era that, by the film's end, this eternally vexed blowhard relents and falls in line with the happy ending. The only other jeopardy presented is a salesman bent on outing Hill as a con man, but even that's resolved expeditiously.Bonus features, by the way, are dang skimpy: a great live performance of Kristin Chenoweth singing ""Till There Was You"" and a brief Making Of featurette.So, sometimes, I guess it's worth it to do a remake of a classic, even though you're taking an enormous chance. In this case, making MEREDITH WILSON'S THE MUSIC MAN pays off. It doesn't replace the original MUSIC MAN as much as add luster to its reputation. I think of it more as an homage than anything else and very much worth your time. I know I'll watch this one again, and, definitely, I'll enjoy it again; I can say the same about the Robert Preston version. Certainly, both films are ideal for viewing whilst you practice your cross-hand piece...",4,"""You really ought to give Iowa a try""",1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,5665,"['just', 'about',

771540,A24ZYSYICMEGSD,B0000BWVMI,Jody Mosier,"[9, 16]","I'm not usually a big fan of musicals, but I absolutely loved this new version of The Music Man! I really don't see how some people think that the 1962 version is much better -- I have seen both versions recently, and the old one just didn't turn me on like this remake does. It just seems rather antiquated and outdated to me in comparison to the 2003 version. But since I'm a member of the younger generation (the 1962 version came out 13 years before I was born, and I'm 28 now) maybe my age has something to do with my preference as to which version I prefer. But I think that while some people might prefer the 1962 version for sentimental reasons, it really can't hold a candle to the 2003 version.Anyway, I fell for this movie hook, line and sinker. I bought the soundtrack not long after the movie came out on TV, and I listen to the CD quite often. I also want to get a copy of the movie when it comes out on video. The 1962 version never got me excited enough to want to buy the soundtrack or film, but this one has.While most of the dialogue, characters and songs are the same, there are some distinct differences between the two versions. One of the main ones is that most, if not all, of the actors and actresses in the 2003 version are all younger than those in the old version. But I think that that adds to the appeal of the film, especially for one aimed at younger audiences. Also, the main meeting place in town is the Ice Cream Parlor, not the Candy Kitchen, and Marcellus Washburn lives in the hotel, not the livery stable. But these differences make the film no less delightful, unless you're an absolute stickler for the original.Everything about this film is fantastic! The props, sets and costumes are very authentic and charming, especially the ladies' hats and dresses. The musical score is just as good as, if not better, than the original version. The emotions of the characters, especially the developing romance between Marian and Professor Hill, are portrayed much better. In the old version, the depths of their love is not as obvious until almost the end of the film.The actors and actresses in the film were perfect for their parts. Matthew Broderick did a fantastic job as the smooth-talking, quick-thinking con artist, yet showed a tender side as well. I had no idea he could sing so well until I saw this movie, and I thought he had a wonderful singing voice. Victor Garber was very funny as Mayor Shinn, and Molly Shannon was humorous as Mrs. Shinn. Cameron Monahagn was an adorable little Winthrop, and he had a charm that Ron Howard, who played the same role in 1962, didn't have. Cameron Davis made a much better Zaneeta than the girl who played it in the 1962 version did -- she wasn't ditzy and giggly (something I found rather annoying about the old Zaneeta), yet she was still delightfully girlish. And Clyde Anders (I belive that was his name) was just right for the part of Tommy Djolies.My favorite character was Marian, played by Kristin Chenoweth. Kristin made an awesome Marian -- she has a gorgeous singing voice for that character, and combined with the dazzling score, her pretty face, and her beautiful outfits, she's an unforgettable portrayal of Marian Paroo. I love it when she sings,""My White Knight"" and ""Lida Rose"" with the quartet. My favorite song in the whole movie is when she sings, ""Till there was You,"" with Matthew Broderick. I like the way it's sung in this movie because both Marian and Professor Hill sing together, whereas in the old version only Marian sings this song.I liked the ending of this film much better as well. In both versions, the boys' band, dressed in full uniform, comes marching out of the schoolhouse. But in the 1962 version, the scene rapidly goes from a few kids in uniform to a huge marching band of nameless adults, which seems to have too many players for a tiny berg like River City. But in the 2003 version, you see the boys' band playing on Main Street, marching along with all the other characters from the town, which seems much more fitting and gives a sense of community pride.One of the best things I liked about this movie is that it's CLEAN! This is one movie you can enjoy with your kids without having to worry about fast-forwarding through anything. This film is positive proof that we can make films in the new millineum -- with top-notch stars -- that provide not only decent, but delightful entertainment.

771541,AA3EC3LKOBD80,B0000BWVMI,Jonathan Cohen,"[3, 5]","I've already let you know how much I love ""The Music Man"", the greatest piece of musical Americana ever written. So what a lovely surprise to revisit this Disney/TV remake, which was much better than I remembered- or expected! It may not have the energy and gaudy flavor that made the '62 version such a lovable powerhouse, but this one has a warmth and intimacy all its own. Matthew Broderick won't make you forget about Robert Preston, but I think his laid-back Harold Hill is just as effective in its own way. Rather than razzle-dazzle 'em with a load of (don't bother, this is a family show), Broderick's reading actually talks to the townspeople- especially the kids- and the audience.There's also real chemistry between him and Marian, here played- and played well- by Broadway's little blonde mighty mite, Kristin Chenoweth. As great as Shirley Jones was way back when, Kristin not only sings beautifully but brings the cool librarian out of the ice box both in the ""Marian the Librarian"" number and later scenes with Hill.Supporting players, too, keep the warmth going. I liked Debra Monk's work as Mrs. Paroo; she- and all the other female characters- got rid of the snippy tone from the original. They also get to do both versions of ""Pick-A-Little""; the reprise adds to Marian's depth as well as theirs. As previously noted, Buddy Hackett just sounded out of place the first time around (whoever heard of a Flatbush accent in Iowa?); this Marcellus, played by David Baker, really comes over like the ""domesticated con man"" he was supposed to be. He even kicks off ""Shipoopi"" great.The one thing that doesn't change, of course, is that incomparable Meredith Willson score. There's just no way you can spoil it. Sure, Preston jumps right out of your screen, but after the first few minutes- you don't miss him! Only complete dolts could make ""Trouble In River City"", ""76 Trombones"", ""Pick-A-Little"" and all the other comic patter numbers go flat, and this company is anything but doltish. The one Marian solo that didn't make the original cut, ""My White Knight"", is in here, and Kristin's rendition lets you know she really loves that old (here, not-so-old) flim-flam man. Choreographer Katherine Marshall (her brother directed the Oscar-winning ""Chicago"") did a great job, too; she jettisoned the huge production numbers of '62 for a more relaxed approach. The kids look like they're having a ball on ""76 Trombones"", ""Marian"" and ""Shipoopi"".It's obvious that the folks who made this rendition of a great American musical didn't want to simply rehash a movie that wasn't exactly crying out for a remake. Instead, they made a laid-back version that, in its own way, works just as well- sort of a high-class stage approach without the old-Hollywood pizzazz.While I'd still recommend the '62 version to all musical, Americana and family-classic fans- after all, Robert Preston will always be Harold Hill- the new-millennium ""Music Man"" is as good as a made-for-TV musical can get. If you're involved in a school or community production- and, God willing, there'll always be a ""Music Man"" mounted somewhere- you might really like the very human readings offered here.

Alphs,"[0, 1]","""The Music Man"" is the story of professional con artist Professor Harold Hill, who sets out to con the citizens of River City, Iowa into forming a boys band. During his scheme he meets up with his old buddy Marcellis, who informs him of the new pool table Mayor Shinn has recently installed in the billard parlor. This piece of news gives Harold Hill the ""trouble"" he needs to convince the good citizens of River City that the only way to prevent corruption in their children is to form a boys band. Along the way he encounters Marian Paroo, the local librarian/music teacher, her mother Mrs. Paroo and her brother, Winthrop. Marian attempts to expose Hill for the fake he is, but in the end after seeing how he treats her mother and brother she falls head over heels for Hill. In the meantime Mayor Shinn pursues the adventure of obtaining Hills credentials however he is foiled at every turn by Hill himself with the help of the River City School Board. This new version of ""The Music Man"" contains the original score/story by Meredith Wilson with a fresh cast of talented performers. Matthew Broderick shines as Professor Harold Hill with Christian Chenoweth playing the role of Marian the Librarian, Debra Monk as Mrs. Paroo, Victor Garber as Mayor Shinn and Molly Shannon as Mrs. Shinn.

I agree there are bits and pieces of this one that re-interpolate music from the stage version (but they seem to leave as much out). It looks like a straight-to-DVD release and is directed, filmed and cut like a first draft of a novel that has not yet found its vision. The characters and acting are flat and all painted in the same shades, the sets are almost too cramped to stage the musical numbers adequately (compare the way the Preston/Jones version manages the library scene, whose set includes a spiral staircase used cleverly so the space never seems constrained. I've been in this show, and some of these songs have very precise and tricky tempos, many of which get completely lost in the newer version (compare the two opening Rock Island songs; the old one is sharp and clever, and each of the unnamed salesmen has a distinctive personality. This one slurs what should be very precise timing. I think that's what I missed: the precision that gave you brilliant comedic timing both with voicing and movement, and the overall sense of style and panache. I'm not even sure the costuming for the newer version is exactly right for the year Meredith Wilson meant (1912) and you can't begin to compare the costume designs for this production over the 1962 version.

I can't wait to hear her interpretation of each song.  She is a little stiff at the beginning of the movie, but I warmed to her with each song.I like Robert Preston, he was a great music man, but I really found that Robert Preston was not the most romantic guy in the world.  I always felt at the end of the Preston version that he really wasn't in love with Marion.  I like Broderick as the music man.  Not because he was such a great saleman, but because you could really tell he was a changed man by the end of the movie.  You could see him falling in love with Marion.  I didn't know Broderick could sing and I was wonderfully surprised with his singing (I don't think Preston really sang as much as talked his songs). I loved this movies version of ""Till there was you.""  What a great job!  Broderick and his co-star sound so good together.  This song moved me and I have to listen to it several times each time I sit down to watch the movie.The sets and costumes were very nice.  The dance numbers were better than the first movie.  I liked this version much more than the Preston version.  If you love the Preston version, this version may disappoint you.  But, if the Preston version left you, like it left me, feeling that something was wanting, try this version.

Personally, I never liked the original film version of ""The Music Man"". I don't understand why everyone raves about it so much. I thought the film was poorly done. The backgrounds look like cheap sets from a high school play, and the chemistry between Robert Preston & Shirley Jones leaves much to be desired. In additon, there was not enough focus on them, and it never really seemed as if Preston's Hill was in actually in love with Marian.However, this new version has corrected all of that.  The sets are 1,000 times better.  It actually looks real - go figure!  I thought the chemistry between Broderick & Chenoweth was much better, and the increased attention paid to their relationship made the film much more romantic.  The added bonus was that the believability of their love story made the whole plot seem more realistic.Just for the record, this recommendation comes from a person who loves classic films and usually despises all remakes.

771549,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B0000BWVMI,Mark Baker,"[38, 42]","Professor Harold Hill has come to River City, Iowa, to get them to start a boys' marching band.  He claims he can teach the students to play; all the parents need to do is buy the instruments and uniforms.  Only the mayor and Marian, the local librarian and piano teacher, seem at all suspicious of this fast talking smooth salesman.  Can they find the proof they need to stop him from swindling the rest of the town?  Will they want to?I'm almost ashamed to say that this was my introduction to this classic American musical only because it took me this long to see it.  I fell in love with it as soon as I saw it, however.  Since I had nothing to compare it to, I thought it was wonderful.  I have since seen the original film, and I can see differences.  Matthew Broderick plans a toned down version of Harold Hill, but I find his charm more appealing as a selling point to the town's people.  Kristin Chenoweth shines as Marion.  That woman can sing and brings real warmth to the roll.  The rest of the cast is wonderful as well, especially Victor Garber as the mayor and Molly Shannon as his wife.  Considering Victor Garber's past musical experience, I was surprised at how small his part here really was, but he makes every appearance memorable.  This version takes better advantage of the film format for some truly inventive, fun dance numbers, especially in ""Seventy-six Trombones"" and ""Marian the Librarian.""Those hoping for some nice bonus features on the DVD like I was will be disappointed.  There is only a short (7 or 8 minute) documentary on the making of the film that barely scratches the surface and a special recording of Kristin Chenoweth singing ""Till there was You.""  The movie itself is presented in full frame, which makes sense considering it was made for TV.  Picture quality and sound are top notch throughout the DVD.So, which version is better?  That's really a hard call.  Those raised with Robert Preston will probably find flaws with this version and reasons to like the original.  I think I lean a little more toward this one, mainly for the dance numbers and favorites in the cast.

When I saw that it had been remade I was, at once, horrified and fascinated. What will they have done to improve the original? Could they improve the original? Well, the short answer is they couldn't and they haven't.My main concern was, and is, Matthew Broderick. Although undoubtably a talented musical theatre performer (I enjoyed his performance on the Producers and the How To Suceed ... soundtracks) he is no Robert Preston, which in my books means that he's no Harold Hill! He seems to suffer from a stiff neck for the duration of the film as he hardly moves his head (maybe it's those high collars!). In some of the numbers he looks positively uncomfortable! His voice is not suited to the role and in numbers like 76 Trombones, shows itself to be very weak. The rest of the cast is good, but not in comparison with their counterparts from the original film.The saving grace to this production is the direction and choreography. The original film is slightly stagey with it's direction (something I actually find endearing), but this one really allows us to explore River City, Iowa and meet it's residents. The choreography dares to be different from the original and I especially love what has been done with 76 Trombones. The sets and costumes are equally impressive, especially when you consider that this was made for television.On the whole, an entertaining couple of hours but I would recommend watching Mr Preston in action first.

Was anyone struck by how wooden and mechanical Matthew Broderick's performance is? At times he sounds like he's reading cue cards, and at others his movements resemble those of a puppet, marionette, or wind-up toy. I kept looking during ""76 Trombones"" to see if he had any visible strings attached. And that blank face of his shows almost no expression. Broderick is a gigantic blemish on a production that is excellent in many points and which I vastly prefer to the 1962 version. The period small-town atmosphere is nostalgically recreated, Kristen Chenoweth is great, the staging in many of the musical numbers (eg. ""Iowa Stubborn"", ""Marian the Librarian"" ""The Wells Fargo Wagon"") is brilliant. The cast radiates youth and vitality, unlike the original 1962 version, whose shopworn cast looks like its been hanging around on the set since the stage premiere. But believe me: as far as Harold Hill is concerned, Broderick isn't worthy to shine Robert Preston's marching boots. Whereas previously we had a MUSIC MAN with superlative Harold Hill and a weak production, now the situation is reversed. So again I say, what a shame.One final point: ""Trouble"" looks and sounds all wrong. Hill is here assuming the mantle of an itinerant revivalist preacher; his mesmerizing patter is like a fiery sermon. He is cataloguing rather scandalous behavior for the time, and the townspeople should be reacting with shock. Here, instead of preaching Broderick dances around like an idiot, while the people just stand there.

771554,A2VLW5TNOQIIEQ,B0000BWVMI,Nancy Morse,"[0, 0]","Can't get that song out of my head:  Seventy-six Trombones in the Big Parade....I had been told that this was a well-done version of The Music Man.As a musician, having played in the pit for a six-week run of this musical many years ago, as well as six prior weeks as a rehearsal pianist of a fine - if local - production....I knew this musical quite well.Having only observed the &#34;train scene&#34; without any scenery in a rehearsal room and then seen it come to life on the stage, it was very interesting to see how nicely it was done in this movie.  The pace is good and the main characters are very charming but still realistic.This is, of course, a story about small-town life at a certain period of time in America.  A lot of us grew up in such circumstances.While the whole idea of the story is contrived, I remember, when in the School of Music at college, we were told that the musical instrument companies were in real trouble (who wasn't?) during the Great Depression.The Elkhart, Indiana Musical Instrument companies (or one of them) had to come up with a gimmick to save themselves from going under.One of their statements was:  &#34;A BOY WHO BLOWS A HORN WILL NEVER BLOW A SAFE!&#34;I never forgot that.What is clear in this musical to me are these things:Relatives are dyin' to be proud of their kids, siblings, children, grandchildren, nieces/nephews.....Kids can be developed in character when they have an opportunity to excel, and are given a chance to learn something wonderful.That it is unrealistic to believe that such a shyster as the salesman, would do a complete change of character because of the love of a woman.  But it has happened, I suppose.  But is it permanent?

771555,A1FYEZ7XGPD7LR,B0000BWVMI,Q.Q. McMudd,"[5, 6]","""I came not to pan Broderick but to praise Preston""I was looking foward to this version of The Music Man after enjoying Mathew Broderick's performance in The Producers.  Unfortunately, Broderick completely lacked the charisma, voice, range, and rougish charm that Preston brought to the original Music Man.Take for instance the library scene and score; Broderick was unable to bring the energy necessary that MeredithWilson's score required. His voice was weak, he appeared clumsy during the choreography, and as such, unable to create the energy necessary to affect the lyrics and music required to develop the relationship between Marion the Librarian and Professor Hill. This scene was necessary to show the viewer of the growing infactuation of Marion Paroo to Harold Hill, and Hill's attempt to further his seduction and control of Marion to insure his successful con.Another scene not as poignant but as revealing is the one in which Hill and Marcellus are in the bar/barn and the Professor sings ""Sadder But Wiser Girl For Me"".  Broderick just simply is/was unable to bring the rougish humor, wit, and style that Preston did so well.As much as I admire Kristin Chenoweth, she does not possess the vocal abilty of Shirley Jones nor does Cameron Monaghan bring the performance of Winthrop Paroo as well as Ron Howard. Cameron just can't lisp properly.After watching this version, I brought out my DVD of the original hoping to again step into the shoes of Professor Harold Hill, seducing Marian Paroo, and con the hapless citizens of River City, Iowa.  I did... and found as much enjoyment watching it for the 60th time as I did the first time.In support of Broderick's effort, he did enunciate the lyrics more clearly and sung his songs one octave higher.  He gave a good effort and brought a lot of energy, but the burdon of besting Preston is almost an impossible task.The origanl is a musical masterpiece and may well be the best musical ever produced.  If you have only seen the TV version with Broderick, I urge to to purchase or rent the original.

I was in Atlanta at the annual Junior Theater Festival and learned that ABC was allowing us a sneak peek at its' latest attempt at staging a Broadway musical. I was delighted, for Matthew Broderick is my favorite actor along with Nathan Lane. I must say that this production, though not as superb as the original with the definitive Harold Hill, Robert  Preston, this production, from the executive producers of ""Chicago"", is great fun.For those not familar with ""The Music Man"", it is a Broadway favorite, with the book and lyrics written by Meredith Wilson, who also composed the songs! Talk about a triple threat! It has become a favorite to Broadway lovers around the world, with productions showing up all over. (I cannot count the number of production I have seen!) The story revolves around Harold Hill, a con man who has come to River City in order to sell band uniforms and instuments to the towns families, telling them that they desperately need a boy's band in order to keep the boys out of trouble. The story is engaging and humorous, as Marian the librarian causes some trouble for Hill, and Hill falls for her! uh, Oh!Matthew Broderick was not terrible as Harold Hill, but he was not exactly incredible either. (And believe me, it is hard for me to say ANYTHING bad about Matthew Brodrick, but I'm trying to do the review from an objective standpoint). Very wisely, Broderick does not try to imitate Robert Preston's outstanding performance, as many try to do. He trys to make the character his own, and does a fine job. Just nowhere near Preston's standards. It almost seems like a Grown-up Ferris Bueller has come to River City. But all-in-all, a good performance.However, Kristen Chenowenth is marvelous as Marian. She won a Best Actress Tony in 1999 for her performance in the Broadway production of ""You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown"". She shines as Marian in every way. A tremendous performance.This production of ""The Music Man"", though not as good as the original 1962 movie, seems less ""stagey"". The choreography seems to move more freely to different settings in musical numbers, a subsequent problem with the original movie. It always bugs me when movie adaptations to Broadway musicals seem to ""stagegy"", not a problem with this adaptation.All-in-all, I think that it is hard to choose between this or the original. I beleive both are great, and if you can, buy both in order to see. However, I believe musical-theater junkies alike will savor Robert Preston in his definitive role. However, children and musical-haters will be more drawn to this remake, an enchanting revist to an old favorite.*****If you bought and enjoyed this movie, make sure to check out the classic musicals ""Fiddler on the Roof"", ""West Side Story"" and the other ABC remake ""Cinderella""- Bernadette Peters is a marvel in it.",4,"No replacement to original, but great",1070755200,"12 7, 2003",2003,2912,"['was', 'one', 'first', '200', 'people', 'view', 'remake', 'Meredith', 'Wilson', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'Atlanta', 'annual', 'Junior', 'Theater', 'Festival', 'learned', 'ABC', 'was', 'allowing', 'sneak', 'peek', 'latest', 'attempt', 'staging', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'was', 'delighted', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'favorite', 'actor', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'must', 'say', 'production', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'superb', 'original', 'definitive', 'Harold', 'Hill', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'production', 'executive', 'producers', 'Chicago', 'great', 'fun.For', 'not', 'familar', 'Music', 'Man', 'Broadway', 'favorite', 'book', 'lyrics', 'written', 'Meredith', 'Wilson', 'who', 'also', 'composed', 'songs', 'Talk', 'triple', 'threat', 'become', 'favorite', 'Broadway', 'lovers', 'world', 'productions', 'showing', 'up', 'can', 'not', 'count', 'number', 'production', 'have', 'seen', 'story', 'around', 'Harold', 'Hill', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'come', 'River', 'City', 'order', 'sell', 'band', 'uniforms', 'instuments', 'towns', 'families', 'telling', 'desperately', 'need', 'boy', 'band', 'order', 'keep', 'boys', 'trouble', 'story', 'engaging', 'humorous', 'Marian', 'librarian', 'trouble', 'Hill', 'Hill', 'uh', 'Oh', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'was', 'not', 'terrible', 'Harold', 'Hill', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'incredible', 'either', 'believe', 'hard', 'say', 'ANYTHING', 'bad', 'Matthew', 'Brodrick', ""'m"", 'trying', 'do', 'review', 'objective', 'standpoint', 'Very', 'wisely', 'Broderick', 'not', 'try', 'imitate', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'many', 'try', 'do', 'make', 'character', 'own', 'fine', 'job', 'Just', 'nowhere', 'Preston', 'standards', 'almost', 'Grown-up', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'come', 'River', 'City', 'all-in-all', 'good', 'performance.However', 'Kristen', 'Chenowenth', 'marvelous', 'Marian', 'won', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Tony', '1999', 'performance', 'Broadway', 'production', ""'re"", 'Good', 'Man', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Marian', 'way', 'tremendous', 'performance.This', 'production', 'Music', 'Man', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', '1962', 'movie', 'less', 'stagey', 'choreography', 'move', 'more', 'freely', 'different', 'settings', 'musical', 'numbers', 'subsequent', 'problem', 'original', 'movie', 'always', 'bugs', 'when', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'Broadway', 'musicals', 'seem', 'stagegy', 'not', 'problem', 'adaptation.All-in-all', 'think', 'hard', 'choose', 'original', 'beleive', 'are', 'great', 'can', 'buy', 'order', 'see', 'However', 'believe', 'musical-theater', 'junkies', 'alike', 'will', 'savor', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'definitive', 'role', 'However', 'children', 'musical-haters', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'drawn', 'remake', 'enchanting', 'revist', 'old', 'favorite', 'bought', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'make', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'classic', 'musicals', 'Fiddler', 'Roof', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'other', 'ABC', 'remake', 'Cinderella', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'marvel']",N/A
771561,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,B0000BWVMI,Thomas Glebe,"[5, 11]","Okay, okay, the 1962 version of the Broadway musical turned film, starring Robert Preston (in the part of his life) and Shirley Jones, super sweet and sexy at the same time and with the voice of an angel, happens to be one of my favorite films of all time.  But this version?  Forgettabout it.When I first checked out reviews for this after seeing it in its first TV showing (or seeing MOST of it since, I think I started switching channels halfway through), and checking out if it was available on DVD, I was not only a bit shocked they'd even waste a good blank DVD on it but then have the nerve to charge people to buy/rent it, but by some of the POSITIVE reviews.  What movie were these folks watching, I wonder, or is it just self-denial, or perhaps they've never seen the 1962 version, or perhaps they just don't know what ""The Music Man"" is and should be all about?Still, I gave it a chance.  The opening sequence looks and sounds good, the production values good, but my first clue something was ""wrong"" here was the presence of an Afro-American traveling salesman.  This was just not realistic for the time period or places involved.  And when Matthew Broderick (playing Harold Hill) takes his first stroll through River City, Iowa, circa early 20th century, more blacks.  Fancily dressed ladies and little kids, all living in racial harmony in 1912 Iowa?  Just not realistic.  I think I even spotted an oriental or two, and these are not ""racist"" remarks at all.  It's just that this just wasn't the way it was back then.  Nowhere in the country back then actually, but especially the time period this takes place in.  Egads, give me a break Disney on the over-the-top and totally inappropriate political correctness.It was only when Matthew Broderick, already early on in the movie exhibiting none of the personality characteristics or mannerisms Preston made famous, started ""acting"" however, saying words and speaking lines like he were tied to a morphine drip, did I start to wonder, what the heck are they butchering a classic for?  I kept watching though and when Ferris started to dance around like an 80 year old and sing lines with almost no real emotion or energy or spirit, that I knew this was going to be bad.  Matthews' energy level compared to Preston is like a 40 watt light bulb compared to the spotlight on top of the Luxor in Vegas.  He butchers EVERY song.  His ""Trouble in River City"" is without a doubt the worst though I think.The woman who plays Marion the Librarian, while she can sing well enough, is also a horrible miscast.  While she sings like a bird (though not nearly as good as Shirley Jones in the original), her acting is generally poor, forced, and her voice is squeaky and her whole ""look"" nowhere near what it should be. As others have mentioned, the barbershop quartet guys seem much too young, the mayor of the town is played all wrong, although the stuttering kid (played originally by Ron Howard) is okay.The production values are really about the only good thing about this movie, but almost everything else is wrong.  It's hard for me to remember such a blatant bad job of casting here mainly.  Matthew Broderick can act, for all we know, he can sing or dance.  But he ""acts"" and sings and dances throughout without any magic or enthusiasm at all.  Change the two leads here at least, and ditch the unrealistic and almost insulting political correctness here, and this might've been something good.  Though still nowhere near the 1962 version.Save your money and buy the REAL version, and make a VHS copy or DVD recording of this next time it's shown on the tube.  Imho, there really are no legitimate excuses for trying to remake virtually perfectly done originals.  Witness the color remake of ""Psycho.""  This whole project should've sat in the can.  And don't they do screentests and tryouts for parts anymore?

Some viewed this production as blasphemy of a great American musical. Robert Preston and Shirley Jones did a good enough job in the original, so why tamper with a classic? Without a doubt, the original film version is a classic and is the better production. This is not to say, however, that the made for television production starring Matthew Broderick as Professor Harold Hill and Kristen Chenoweth as River City's faithful librarian Marion does not have its good points. Broderick does a wonderful job presenting his interpretation of Harold Hill. He has the same mischivios charm and charisma that made FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF such a success and I suppose we can easily imagine the fictional Ferris Bueller growing up and becoming a Harold Hill. Broderick uses his many talents to make the role come to life and does more than an adequate job. The musical numbers are lively and the dance scenes are superb. Molly Shannon adds to the cast. I will have to admit that the barbershop quartet in the made for T.V. Version will never rival the Buffalo Bills, and no one can match Buddy Hackett's version of ""Shipoopie"".If the purpose is to present an enjoyable version of an all time classic, this it does rather well.Is this version as good as the stage version or movie? No, but I'm not sure that anyone involved in the production ever expected that it would.

It is indeed singing (soft sounds are coming out of the mouth) but it is not certain that Mr. Broderick should be considered as having a ""singing voice."" (Note that his finest accomplishments can be seen in the recent film, The Election, and in the irrepressible classic John Hughes film, Ferris Bueller.  And don't forget War Games.)  The dubbed singing is a major distraction or even an irritation in the present production.  When the characters move from the right or to the left, the timbre or harmonics of the voice remains the same, and the overall effect is one of artifice.  Was the budget so low that the producer could only afford one microphone?  The absence of an interesting Buddy Hackett character is an empty space in this production.  Buddy Hackett is missed, both in the current production, and in real life.  I also missed the line, ""Try the Palmer House in Chicago.""  Why was this caustic line omitted?  I was also wondering why they needed to do Broadway style dancing in this film about Iowa.  Why not some mountain-style big circle or square dance-style clogging?  They do clog in Iowa, don't they?  A number of clogging steps, e.g., the Wagon Wheel step and East Tennessee Walk step, as well as big circle formations and square formations rarely find their way into Broadway productions or tap dance productions.  Why not tap into the clogging repertoire for a production of The Music Man?  Now for some good thoughts.  The pick-a-little-talk ensemble of women really sizzled.  The young boyfriend character was the most charismatic performer of the present production.  And the female lead was an excellent singer, though her resemblance to Pamela Anderson was somewhat distracting.",3,The original production is still the eternal classic.,1065139200,"10 3, 2003",2003,1842,"['certain', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'singing', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'member', 'community', 'chorus', 'church', 'choir', 'indeed', 'singing', 'soft', 'sounds', 'are', 'coming', 'mouth', 'not', 'certain', 'Mr.', 'Broderick', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'having', 'singing', 'voice', 'Note', 'finest', 'accomplishments', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'recent', 'film', 'Election', 'irrepressible', 'classic', 'John', 'Hughes', 'film', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'War', 'Games', 'dubbed', 'singing', 'major', 'distraction', 'even', 'irritation', 'present', 'production', 'When', 'characters', 'move', 'right', 'left', 'timbre', 'harmonics', 'voice', 'same', 'overall', 'effect', 'one', 'artifice', 'Was', 'budget', 'so', 'low', 'producer', 'could', 'only', 'afford', 'one', 'microphone', 'absence', 'interesting', 'Buddy', 'Hackett', 'character', 'empty', 'space', 'production', 'Buddy', 'Hackett', 'missed', 'current', 'production', 'real', 'life', 'also', 'missed', 'line', 'Try', 'Palmer', 'House', 'Chicago', 'Why', 'was', 'caustic', 'line', 'omitted', 'was', 'also', 'wondering', 'why', 'needed', 'do', 'Broadway', 'style', 'dancing', 'film', 'Iowa', 'Why', 'not', 'mountain-style', 'big', 'circle', 'square', 'dance-style', 'clogging', 'do', 'clog', 'Iowa', 'do', ""n't"", 'number', 'clogging', 'steps', 'e.g.', 'Wagon', 'Wheel', 'step', 'East', 'Tennessee', 'Walk', 'step', 'as', 'well', 'big', 'circle', 'formations', 'square', 'formations', 'rarely', 'find', 'way', 'Broadway', 'productions', 'tap', 'dance', 'productions', 'Why', 'not', 'tap', 'clogging', 'repertoire', 'production', 'Music', 'Man', 'Now', 'good', 'thoughts', 'pick-a-little-talk', 'ensemble', 'women', 'really', 'sizzled', 'young', 'boyfriend', 'character', 'was', 'most', 'charismatic', 'performer', 'present', 'production', 'female', 'lead', 'was', 'excellent', 'singer', 'resemblance', 'Pamela', 'Anderson', 'was', 'somewhat', 'distracting']",N/A
771564,A2491AQB89D4N5,B0000BWVMI,Willard C. Smith,"[86, 93]","Comparisons between the 1962 and 2003 versions of the Music Man are inevitable. And such comparisons are going to center on the different approaches that Robert Preston and Matthew Broderick used to create the character of Professor Harold Hill. While many critics have dismissed Matthew Broderick's characterization, I believe that these critics have overlooked a significant interpretation of the Music Man. I like both versions of The Music Man, because they complement each other.Robert Preston interpreted Harold Hill as a fast talking con man who doubled as a sort of Pied Piper. He would lead and the town people would follow right along. It is fun to watch, but also a little confusing. Here are all these stubborn, stiff-necked Iowa folk being gullibly conned left and right. One would think that the citizens of River City wouldn't have agreed to the creation of a Boys Band unless there was something else going on.On the other hand, Broderick's Harold Hill is someone who can somehow appeal to a person's innermost wants and dreams. He isn't fast talking; instead he is able to get them to invoke their own dreams and wants, and he is able to do this because he is trying to realize his own frustrated dreams. In contrast to Preston, Broderick underplays Harold Hill and it works.No where is this interpretation more evident than in the ""Marian the Librarian"" sequence. Preston's Hill creates havoc in the library by behaving like a Pied Piper and everyone else is swept up in the process. Even Shirley Jones' Marian is temporally swept away.Broderick's Hill mesmerizes Kristin Chenoweth's Marian so that she invokes her dream in an unusual interlude in this number. It works because Broderick's Hill isn't trying to con her into something; he is trying to awaken her hopes and dreams.The ""Trouble in River City"" sequence also highlights this different interpretation of Harold Hill. Robert Preston invokes the atmosphere of a Religious Revival, whereas Broderick jumps from place to place (the barber shop, the ladies hat shop, the street, etc) planting the idea into everyone's head.Once you understand this approach, then other things in the 2003 version of the Music Man make a lot of sense. Unlike the 1962 version where Marian changes her mind because Hill has made Winthrop happy with an instrument; the 2003 version Marian changes her mind because she understands that by realizing Winthop's dreams her brother will come out of his shell. Moreover, in this context, Marian's monologue of why she is glad Hill came to town, even though he is a swindler, makes more sense.Having said all this, the 1962 version is more polished. The editing is crisp. The supporting cast is difficult to beat: Buddy Hackett, Hermonone Gingold, Paul Ford, Ron Howard, and even Mary Wickes!But there are still some things about the 2003 version that I think are superior to the 1962 version. The 1962 version edited the ""My White Knight"" song, whereas Kristin Chenoweth gives us the full version. The dance sequences in the 1962 version are very tight and invoke a sort of Busby Berkeley production. I prefer the 2003 dance sequences because you actually get to see more of the feet, body, and arm movement that were sacrificed in the 1962 production. One last point, you can understand the lyrics in the 2003 version a lot better.LATER ADDITION: Recently I came across a short film of the original Broadway Production with Robert Preston. I was surprised to see that Robert Preston's original interpretation of Harold Hill actually had more in common with Matthew Broderick's interpretation in this version.",4,Broderick reinterprets Harold Hill,1071446400,"12 15, 2003",2003,3607,"['Comparisons', '1962', '2003', 'versions', 'Music', 'Man', 'are', 'inevitable', 'such', 'comparisons', 'are', 'going', 'center', 'different', 'approaches', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'used', 'create', 'character', 'Professor', 'Harold', 'Hill', 'many', 'critics', 'have', 'dismissed', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'characterization', 'believe', 'critics', 'have', 'overlooked', 'significant', 'interpretation', 'Music', 'Man', 'versions', 'Music', 'Man', 'complement', 'other.Robert', 'Preston', 'interpreted', 'Harold', 'Hill', 'fast', 'talking', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'doubled', 'sort', 'Pied', 'Piper', 'would', 'lead', 'town', 'people', 'would', 'follow', 'right', 'along', 'fun', 'watch', 'also', 'little', 'confusing', 'Here', 'are', 'stubborn', 'stiff-necked', 'Iowa', 'folk', 'being', 'gullibly', 'conned', 'left', 'right', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'citizens', 'River', 'City', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'agreed', 'creation', 'Boys', 'Band', 'was', 'something', 'else', 'going', 'other', 'hand', 'Broderick', 'Harold', 'Hill', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'somehow', 'appeal', 'person', 'innermost', 'dreams', ""n't"", 'fast', 'talking', 'instead', 'able', 'get', 'invoke', 'own', 'dreams', 'able', 'do', 'trying', 'realize', 'own', 'frustrated', 'dreams', 'contrast', 'Preston', 'Broderick', 'Harold', 'Hill', 'where', 'interpretation', 'more', 'evident', 'Marian', 'Librarian', 'sequence', 'Preston', 'Hill', 'havoc', 'library', 'behaving', 'Pied', 'Piper', 'everyone', 'else', 'swept', 'up', 'process', 'Even', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'Marian', 'temporally', 'swept', 'away.Broderick', 'Hill', 'Kristin', 'Chenoweth', 'Marian', 'dream', 'unusual', 'interlude', 'number', 'Broderick', 'Hill', ""n't"", 'trying', 'con', 'something', 'trying', 'awaken', 'hopes', 'dreams.The', 'Trouble', 'River', 'City', 'sequence', 'also', 'different', 'interpretation', 'Harold', 'Hill', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'atmosphere', 'Religious', 'Revival', 'whereas', 'Broderick', 'jumps', 'place', 'place', 'barber', 'shop', 'ladies', 'shop', 'street', 'etc', 'planting', 'idea', 'everyone', 'head.Once', 'understand', 'approach', 'then', 'other', 'things', '2003', 'version', 'Music', 'Man', 'make', 'lot', 'sense', '1962', 'version', 'where', 'Marian', 'mind', 'Hill', 'made', 'Winthrop', 'happy', 'instrument', '2003', 'version', 'Marian', 'mind', 'realizing', 'Winthop', 'dreams', 'brother', 'will', 'come', 'shell', 'Moreover', 'context', 'Marian', 'monologue', 'why', 'glad', 'Hill', 'came', 'town', 'even', 'swindler', 'more', 'sense.Having', 'said', '1962', 'version', 'more', 'polished', 'editing', 'crisp', 'supporting', 'cast', 'difficult', 'beat', 'Buddy', 'Hackett', 'Hermonone', 'Gingold', 'Paul', 'Ford', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'even', 'Mary', 'Wickes', 'are', 'still', 'things', '2003', 'version', 'think', 'are', 'superior', '1962', 'version', '1962', 'version', 'edited', 'My', 'White', 'Knight', 'song', 'whereas', 'Kristin', 'Chenoweth', 'full', 'version', 'dance', 'sequences', '1962', 'version', 'are', 'very', 'tight', 'invoke', 'sort', 'Busby', 'Berkeley', 'production', 'prefer', '2003', 'dance', 'sequences', 'actually', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'feet', 'body', 'arm', 'movement', 'were', 'sacrificed', '1962', 'production', 'One', 'last', 'point', 'can', 'understand', 'lyrics', '2003', 'version', 'lot', 'better.LATER', 'ADDITION', 'Recently', 'came', 'short', 'film', 'original', 'Broadway', 'Production', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'original', 'interpretation', 'Harold', 'Hill', 'actually', 'had', 'more', 'common', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'interpretation', 'version']",N/A

Now, I should be clear and tell you folks I have not seen the 1962 version of Music Man and I don't think I will because I don't like to compare between two interperations of work.
