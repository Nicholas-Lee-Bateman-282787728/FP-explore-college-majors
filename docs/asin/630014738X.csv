The soundtrack is also marvelous. The whole cast turns in excellent preformances. Remotely like the novel, it tells an espionage story that seems believable. Especially if you know that the story isn't to far from the truth of dolphin research by the private sector and the military.When Scott does bottle nosed dolphin research he avoids as much publicity as possible. It his intent to further the communication between dolphins and humans without any outside intervention. When his accomplishments reach a level that would allow them to be exploited, the anonimity he once enjoyed becomes a thing of the past.When his dolphins are kidnapped he must figure out if it is his own government or a foreign power that has done it and why. With the assistance of a mercenary he realizes the terrible plot that could topple a goverment. Plenty here for fans of dolphins and action fans alike. Some trivia questions and interviews with Buck Henry, Leslie Charleson, and Edward Herrmann make up the extras.

196776,A3TTKOX35PVLTU,630014738X,"cameron-vale ""cameron-vale""","[29, 33]","DAY OF THE DOLPHIN (1973):  In a Florida research compound, Dr. Jake Terrell (George C. Scott) and his marine biologist associates devote years secretly teaching two dolphins, Fa and Bee, how to speak a simple form of English.  The sweet and loving dolphins are incredibly intelligent and have developed an intense devotion to Dr. Terrell.  Word of the success of Terrell's project is leaked to the outside world,  and the skills of the easily trained dolphins are eventually sought by a  well financed, shadowy consortium with evil intentions.Arguably the last great film directed by  Mike Nichols, DAY OF THE DOLPHIN is a classy, beautifully produced science fiction/political conspiracy thriller with a heart.  Despite its potentially maudlin  storyline, Buck Henry's serious, unironic screenplay and Nichols'  graceful direction carefully avoid sentimentality at every possible turn.  Initially the story concentrates on Terrell and his relationship with his coworkers as their long work with the two dolphins is revealed to have achieved truly astounding results.  Fa and Bee are lovely and enchanting creatures with very sweet, babyish voices.  Things become deadly serious in the film's relentless second half, but because the conspiracy theme has been introduced so gradually the change in tone and the orchestrated melodramatics are perfectly acceptable.George C. Scott plays the bad tempered Terrell with the actor's trademark intensity.  Its a passionate and powerful performance, and its perfectly easy to see why the dolphins look at him like some kind of god who towers above the other humans.  Scott is the main show here, but the superb supporting cast, led by Paul Sorvino,  Edward Herrmann, Fritz Weaver,  Severn Darden and Scott's wife Trish Van Devere ably bring a strong sense of realism to all of the fantasy on view.Georges Delerue's stirringly emotional music adds immeasurably to the effectiveness of the film; his sad, lovely score turns the deeply moving climactic sequence into a heartbreaking apocalypse of despair.  This utterly bleak finale is one of the most potent and uncompromising endings in the fantasy genre.William A. Fraker's gorgeous cinematography makes the sparkling,  shifting waters and deep blue skies breathtakingly luminous.  Fraker's stunning imagery alone makes the movie a total pleasure to watch.  The underwater scenes, shot by Jordan Klein, contain absolutely some of the finest such work ever seen.The Home Vision Entertainment DVD is highly recommended for fans of this wonderful film.  Presented in the film's original theatrical release aspect ratio (2.35:1), its a spectacularly perfect transfer, with vivid, lush colors and no noticeable speckles or flaws of any kind.  A skimpy assortment of extras include an interview with writer Buck Henry, who is clearly and bizarrely embarrassed by his association with this great film, additional interviews with cast members Leslie Charleson and Edward Herrmann, and a trivia gallery.  The liner notes are incredibly silly and juvenile.  Despite its disappointing array of mostly worthless extras, this DVD is a spectacularly worthy investment for any serious movie fan, the definitive presentation  of one of the most exciting and thought provoking of all conspiracy thrillers.",5,Eccentric But Powerful Conspiracy Thriller,1059609600,"07 31, 2003",2003,3280,"['DAY', 'THE', 'DOLPHIN', '1973', 'Florida', 'research', 'compound', 'Dr.', 'Jake', 'Terrell', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'marine', 'biologist', 'associates', 'devote', 'years', 'secretly', 'teaching', 'two', 'dolphins', 'Fa', 'Bee', 'how', 'speak', 'simple', 'form', 'English', 'sweet', 'loving', 'dolphins', 'are', 'incredibly', 'intelligent', 'have', 'developed', 'intense', 'devotion', 'Dr.', 'Terrell', 'Word', 'success', 'Terrell', 'project', 'leaked', 'outside', 'world', 'skills', 'easily', 'trained', 'dolphins', 'are', 'eventually', 'sought', 'well', 'financed', 'shadowy', 'consortium', 'evil', 'intentions.Arguably', 'last', 'great', 'film', 'directed', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'DAY', 'THE', 'DOLPHIN', 'classy', 'beautifully', 'produced', 'science', 'fiction/political', 'conspiracy', 'thriller', 'heart', 'potentially', 'maudlin', 'storyline', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'serious', 'unironic', 'screenplay', 'Nichols', 'graceful', 'direction', 'carefully', 'avoid', 'sentimentality', 'possible', 'turn', 'Initially', 'story', 'Terrell', 'relationship', 'coworkers', 'long', 'work', 'two', 'dolphins', 'revealed', 'have', 'achieved', 'truly', 'astounding', 'results', 'Fa', 'Bee', 'are', 'lovely', 'enchanting', 'creatures', 'very', 'sweet', 'babyish', 'voices', 'Things', 'become', 'deadly', 'serious', 'film', 'relentless', 'second', 'half', 'conspiracy', 'theme', 'been', 'introduced', 'so', 'gradually', 'change', 'tone', 'orchestrated', 'melodramatics', 'are', 'perfectly', 'acceptable.George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'bad', 'tempered', 'Terrell', 'actor', 'trademark', 'intensity', 'passionate', 'powerful', 'performance', 'perfectly', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'dolphins', 'look', 'kind', 'god', 'who', 'other', 'humans', 'Scott', 'main', 'show', 'here', 'superb', 'supporting', 'cast', 'led', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'Edward', 'Herrmann', 'Fritz', 'Weaver', 'Severn', 'Darden', 'Scott', 'wife', 'Trish', 'Van', 'Devere', 'ably', 'bring', 'strong', 'sense', 'realism', 'fantasy', 'view.Georges', 'Delerue', 'stirringly', 'emotional', 'music', 'immeasurably', 'effectiveness', 'film', 'sad', 'lovely', 'score', 'deeply', 'moving', 'climactic', 'sequence', 'heartbreaking', 'apocalypse', 'despair', 'utterly', 'bleak', 'finale', 'one', 'most', 'potent', 'uncompromising', 'endings', 'fantasy', 'genre.William', 'A.', 'Fraker', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'sparkling', 'shifting', 'waters', 'deep', 'blue', 'skies', 'breathtakingly', 'luminous', 'Fraker', 'stunning', 'imagery', 'alone', 'movie', 'total', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'underwater', 'scenes', 'shot', 'Jordan', 'Klein', 'contain', 'absolutely', 'finest', 'such', 'work', 'ever', 'seen.The', 'Home', 'Vision', 'Entertainment', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Presented', 'film', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'aspect', 'ratio', '2.35:1', 'spectacularly', 'perfect', 'transfer', 'vivid', 'lush', 'colors', 'noticeable', 'speckles', 'flaws', 'kind', 'skimpy', 'assortment', 'extras', 'include', 'interview', 'writer', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'who', 'clearly', 'bizarrely', 'embarrassed', 'association', 'great', 'film', 'additional', 'interviews', 'cast', 'members', 'Leslie', 'Charleson', 'Edward', 'Herrmann', 'trivia', 'gallery', 'liner', 'notes', 'are', 'incredibly', 'silly', 'juvenile', 'disappointing', 'array', 'mostly', 'worthless', 'extras', 'DVD', 'spectacularly', 'worthy', 'investment', 'serious', 'movie', 'fan', 'definitive', 'presentation', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', 'thought', 'provoking', 'conspiracy', 'thrillers']",The Day of the Dolphin VHS

According to this movie you bet!Being a scientist on your own can be tedious. Tied to other people's money you have obligations to the foundation that pays your bills. If it's not charity that gets you financed then what interest does the organization have in your research?We start with a man's dedication to his scientific background. Dr. Jake Terrel played by George C. Scott (great casting there). He's out on an island with his research center studying dolphins. Its leading edge research so he's a little close mouthed about his results. The foundation that supports his work has a little request. It's to let a journalist come out & do a story on him & his work.So begins our intro to Curtis Mahoney played by Paul Sorvino (yes Law & Order), Jake's wife played by Trish Van Devere. You know she won't get any awards for this role but no one could have done any better, really great casting here. Oh yes, Lets not forget the lead star of the show dolphins named Alpha & Beta.This is a mystery & a thriller that's well done but I don't want to use ""spoilers"" in this review.

This movie as I saw it was very good at the beginning.  The lecture was interesting though I sensed the secret aspect of the Doc's work.  Later that day George C. Scott and Alpha the dolphin have an underwater display of affection that nearly breaks the species barrier.  This along with a heart moving score make it easily the best scene in the movie.  Also the tape recorded session was extremely good.  It was chilling to think a dolphin could talk. Hey, let yourself go! Who said imagination is more important than knowledge?When the government steps in to use the dolphins to kill as attack marine mammals then the movie goes into a slump.  It begins to deal with betrayal, murder, limited spy foolishness, an explosions.  Hence a good in depth drama turns to a weak thriller.  One more thing, In all this research no human learns a word of the dolphin's language.  Try the opposite and see how hard it is.  And give this movie a try.

196781,A13BLSXL78EMRX,630014738X,Jason Troy,"[4, 5]","Throughout the motion picture business there is many a thespian who truly believes in their role. Some more than others and is why a few become exceptional. The original script called "" The Day of The Dolphin "" was delivered to several actors, prior to the film's inception. When the principal actor read the interesting dialog between himself and his subject called Alpha, he was not only intrigued, but anxious to begin. The story centers around a Research Scientist named Dr. Jake Terrell (George C. Scott) and his wife Maggie. (Trish Van Devere) Their secret island project concerns a special Dolphin, whom they have raised since birth. In an amazing feat of Phonetic science, laboring on the cutting edge and years of patience instruction, they have taught their unique Dolphin to speak English. However, their financial benefactors are not men with lofty ideals like Dr. Terrell or his staff. Indeed their primary goal is to use the amazing oceanic mammal to swim underwater undetected to a secured location where the President of the U.S. is vacationing and eliminate the Chief Executive. Although it's Harold DeMilo (Fritz Weaver) the C.E.O. of the funding institute who plans on subverting Dr. Terrell's innovative project, it's a strange, mysterious and uninvited visitor, Curtis Mahoney (Paul Sorvino) whom they suspect is behind the theft of their special Dolphin and a midnight murder. Trust is not inherent between the characters, indeed the audience is in for a surprise or two. However it's this very element which gives the film it's dramatic texture. The cast is incredible and delivers a dynamite performance which as a result allows this film to become a Classic.

196783,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,630014738X,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[15, 16]","Ever seen a political thriller that employs dolphins as potential assassins?  Why the heck not?  As a curiosity, it's hard to beat ""The Day of the Dolphin.""  Bringing together a bizarre amalgamation of talent-- this 1973 film stars George C. Scott (a few years after his Oscar for ""Patton""), was written by Buck Henry (known mostly for comedy), and was directed by Mike Nichols (yes, that Mike Nichols)!  Nichols has done everything from ""The Graduate"" and ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" through to the more current ""Closer"" and ""Angels in America""--and this bit of sci-fi seems at odds with most of his resume.  Curiously, though, he took ""Dolphin"" over from Roman Polanski (Polanski dropped out when his wife, Sharon Tate, was murdered by the Manson family).  Heck, the backstory alone is cause enough to check out this picture!Telling the story of a dolphin research facility, Scott plays its leader.  Financed by a large corporation, their work is largely unknown even by their sponsors.  They have been working on communication techniques and their unorthodox secrecy starts to raise various suspicions.  Paul Sorvino, as a mysterious intruder, starts to poke around menacingly and all that is of value to Scott and his team is threatened.  Publicly revealing the truth behind their experiments to their bosses, they now find themselves pawns in a larger scheme.  It's hard to determine who to trust as potential allies are shown to be villains and vice versa.  And caught in the middle are the dolphins who are to be exploited as bomb carrying assassins.While, in truth, ""The Day of the Dolphin"" advertises itself as a political thriller with a sci-fi component--I think you'd be better off going into the film knowing nothing about it.  But it seems unlikely that anyone could do that.  The film's plot is used to sell the picture, so any potential surprises are given away in its marketing.  The assassination scheme doesn't manifest itself until the second half of the film and might have made a great twist, but, as is, it's actually something that the audience is anticipating.  While the political element is prominently advertised, it is quite vaguely defined and relatively superfluous.  ""The Day of the Dolphin"" works best as sci-fi.  Not sci-fi as in aliens and different worlds--but in its truest sense, Science employed as Fiction.  The research done with the dolphins incorporates reality and fantasy in a nice combination, and works because it is understated.  ""Dolphin"" also shows man's influence over nature (both good and bad) and how our need for technological superiority can lead to unforeseen and harmful consequences.  The dolphins trust that man is their friend, but that friendship is something that can ultimately be used for evil.  This ends up being largely a relationship piece, and as odd as it might sound--the central relationship is between Scott and a dolphin.Sorvino and Scott are both quite good and carry the weight of the film.  And if the idea of seeing George C. Scott running around in very short shorts drives you insane with lust, then that's an added bonus.  Overall an interesting film, if not a great one.  Recommended because it works--but it's also something of an oddity!  Just don't expect the rousing adventure the DVD cover might promise you, this is more quietly intriguing.

196793,AQP1VPK16SVWM,630014738X,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[43, 44]","The Day of the Dolphin was savaged by critics when it was released. They saw the film as nonsense that made an important issue trivial. While it isn't a perfect film, the adaption by Mike Nichols and Buck Henry (Catch 22) is an entertaining adaption of the popular novel. At one time it showed up fairly frequently on network television but has been forgotten over the years. In some respects, Dolphin is a far more successful film adaption than Nichols' and Henry's film version of Catch 22. They were trying to turn a popular satirical novel turned cultural icon into an entertaining film satire. Many fans of the novel were disappointed and critics were, at times, less than kind to it. Here at least the two were working with a lesser novel and there wasn't as much baggage to go with it.George C. Scott gives a passionate performance. In fact, one thing that you'll note about Scott is whether or not he appeared in trash (The List of Adrian Messenger) or treasure (Patton), his performance is alwasys powerful and committed. Trish Van DeVere also gives a strong performance. She was always underrated as an actress because 1) She was married to Scott and 2)she was always in his shadow. Her performance helps ground what was at the time a farfetched scenerio in reality.Buck Henry's intelligent screenplay does have some narrative problems but, on the whole, he cleans up the novel's unbelievable plot and jumpy narrative. His screenplay is crisp, clean and his characters strong. An interview with Henry is provided as an extra and his comments demonstrate that he doesn't hold his work on the film in very high regard. It's a pity as he does wonders with the material.Nichols always straddled the fence between being an actor's director and a film director. As in his past efforts, this pays off handsomely. His work with Scott and the strong supporting cast (including the marvelous Fritz Weaver, Paul Sorvino in one of his early film roles, Edward Herrmann among many other fine character actors)shines.The plot is fairly straight forward; Scott plays a scientist that has been able to teach Dolphins English and train them to do a number of compliated tasks. He's unaware, though, that the organization funding his efforts has plans to use his research in an assassination attempt on a highly placed political figure.Given what we've learned about the CIA and other organizations over the past decade, it's plot isn't so far fetched. After all, it's certainly more believable than using a powder to make Castro's beard fall out so as to undermine his political power.The superior DVD transfer surprised me given the age of the film. Virtually free of all analog artifacts, this enhanced transfers looks marvelous. It's a pity that Nichols couldn't provide a director's commentary (or Buck Henry for that matter). Since Scott is gone, it would have been fascinating to get Nichols' take on the film and the performances. While is isn't a 5 star film, it's an engrossing and enjoyable bit of entertainment with a cautionary tale at its core.",3,Entertaining political thriller,1059609600,"07 31, 2003",2003,3050,"['Day', 'Dolphin', 'was', 'savaged', 'critics', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'saw', 'film', 'nonsense', 'made', 'important', 'issue', 'trivial', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'film', 'adaption', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'Catch', '22', 'entertaining', 'adaption', 'popular', 'novel', 'one', 'time', 'showed', 'up', 'fairly', 'frequently', 'network', 'television', 'been', 'forgotten', 'years', 'respects', 'Dolphin', 'far', 'more', 'successful', 'film', 'adaption', 'Nichols', 'Henry', 'film', 'version', 'Catch', '22', 'were', 'trying', 'turn', 'popular', 'satirical', 'novel', 'turned', 'cultural', 'icon', 'entertaining', 'film', 'satire', 'Many', 'fans', 'novel', 'were', 'disappointed', 'critics', 'were', 'times', 'less', 'kind', 'Here', 'least', 'two', 'were', 'working', 'lesser', 'novel', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'baggage', 'go', 'it.George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'passionate', 'performance', 'fact', 'one', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'note', 'Scott', 'not', 'appeared', 'trash', 'List', 'Adrian', 'Messenger', 'treasure', 'Patton', 'performance', 'alwasys', 'powerful', 'committed', 'Trish', 'Van', 'DeVere', 'also', 'strong', 'performance', 'was', 'always', 'underrated', 'actress', '1', 'was', 'married', 'Scott', '2', 'was', 'always', 'shadow', 'performance', 'ground', 'what', 'was', 'time', 'farfetched', 'scenerio', 'reality.Buck', 'Henry', 'intelligent', 'screenplay', 'have', 'narrative', 'problems', 'whole', 'up', 'novel', 'unbelievable', 'plot', 'jumpy', 'narrative', 'screenplay', 'crisp', 'clean', 'characters', 'strong', 'interview', 'Henry', 'provided', 'extra', 'comments', 'demonstrate', ""n't"", 'hold', 'work', 'film', 'very', 'high', 'regard', 'pity', 'wonders', 'material.Nichols', 'always', 'straddled', 'fence', 'being', 'actor', 'director', 'film', 'director', 'past', 'efforts', 'off', 'handsomely', 'work', 'Scott', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'marvelous', 'Fritz', 'Weaver', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'one', 'early', 'film', 'roles', 'Edward', 'Herrmann', 'many', 'other', 'fine', 'character', 'actors', 'shines.The', 'plot', 'fairly', 'straight', 'forward', 'Scott', 'scientist', 'been', 'able', 'teach', 'Dolphins', 'English', 'train', 'do', 'number', 'compliated', 'tasks', 'unaware', 'though', 'organization', 'funding', 'efforts', 'plans', 'use', 'research', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'highly', 'placed', 'political', 'figure.Given', 'what', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'CIA', 'other', 'organizations', 'past', 'decade', 'plot', ""n't"", 'so', 'far', 'fetched', 'certainly', 'more', 'believable', 'using', 'powder', 'make', 'Castro', 'beard', 'fall', 'out', 'so', 'undermine', 'political', 'power.The', 'superior', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'surprised', 'given', 'age', 'film', 'Virtually', 'free', 'analog', 'artifacts', 'enhanced', 'transfers', 'marvelous', 'pity', 'Nichols', 'could', ""n't"", 'provide', 'director', 'commentary', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'matter', 'Scott', 'gone', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fascinating', 'get', 'Nichols', 'take', 'film', 'performances', ""n't"", '5', 'star', 'film', 'engrossing', 'enjoyable', 'bit', 'entertainment', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'core']",The Day of the Dolphin VHS
