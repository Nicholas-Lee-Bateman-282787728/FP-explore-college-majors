I thought that EYE was the best movie of all three. There did not seem to be any imagination to the movie unless the movie was intended for the younger crowd. I didn't jump out of my seat. And another thing, why was there not an OPTION to set the language to ENGLISH? It was hard keeping up with the subtitles and I am not a speed reader.

They were thinking they had too many ghost stories left to tell and by their own admission, wanted to make a ghost encyclopedia (as it were).  That they decided to make it into a comedy as well is an unusual choice (I'm not certain why they took this route, as it really doesn't work on that level).  The plot involves a group of dopey kids who swap ghost stories then decide that they'd like to see some ghosts.  As luck, or bad writing, would have it, one of the dopes just happened to have a recipe book on how to attract ghosts.  They put it to the test with disastrous results (not the least of which made this film the final casualty).  Yes, they had to trot out a Ouija Board and play hide and seek in the dark.  One of their number goes missing.  Another member is stalked by a basketball!  There are ghosts aplenty but none of them are the least bit scary.  And for good measure, two of the remaining survivors decide to infiltrate the spirit world.  Everything that could go wrong does.  Worse, they make a lame attempt to tie this to the first two films by referencing them in their roster of ghost stories and using two brief clips identifying them (product placement?).  And yes, there's another elevator scene, they do seem to favor those.  Other than that, the humor is laid on rather thick (complete with a new version of a tongue-lashing).  I can't say I really liked it but it was watchable and I am ashamed to admit I laughed a couple of times (which goes to prove it wasn't a horror movie).Not a keeper.",3,"""Have you seen my report card?""",1345334400,"08 19, 2012",2012,1655,"['now', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'Pang', 'Brothers', 'take', 'U-Turn', 'end', 'up', 'slapstick', 'hell.What', 'were', 'thinking', 'were', 'thinking', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'ghost', 'stories', 'left', 'tell', 'own', 'admission', 'wanted', 'make', 'ghost', 'encyclopedia', 'were', 'decided', 'make', 'comedy', 'well', 'unusual', 'choice', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'why', 'took', 'route', 'really', ""n't"", 'work', 'level', 'plot', 'group', 'dopey', 'kids', 'who', 'swap', 'ghost', 'stories', 'then', 'decide', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'ghosts', 'luck', 'bad', 'writing', 'would', 'have', 'one', 'dopes', 'just', 'happened', 'have', 'recipe', 'book', 'how', 'attract', 'ghosts', 'put', 'test', 'disastrous', 'results', 'not', 'least', 'made', 'film', 'final', 'casualty', 'Yes', 'had', 'trot', 'out', 'Ouija', 'Board', 'play', 'hide', 'seek', 'dark', 'One', 'number', 'missing', 'member', 'stalked', 'basketball', 'are', 'ghosts', 'aplenty', 'none', 'are', 'least', 'bit', 'scary', 'good', 'measure', 'two', 'remaining', 'survivors', 'decide', 'infiltrate', 'spirit', 'world', 'Everything', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'Worse', 'make', 'lame', 'attempt', 'tie', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'referencing', 'roster', 'ghost', 'stories', 'using', 'two', 'brief', 'clips', 'identifying', 'product', 'placement', 'yes', 'elevator', 'scene', 'do', 'seem', 'favor', 'Other', 'humor', 'laid', 'rather', 'thick', 'complete', 'new', 'version', 'tongue-lashing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'watchable', 'am', 'ashamed', 'admit', 'laughed', 'couple', 'times', 'prove', 'was', ""n't"", 'horror', 'movie', 'keeper']",The Eye 3
