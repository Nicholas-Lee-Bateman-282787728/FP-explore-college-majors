815150,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B0001WTWCY,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[1, 1]","Urban comedy and I, we just don't get along for the most part.  We had our rare share of enjoyments, hanging at theBarbershoptogether and having fun dissing people at theCB4, but we otherwiseroll bounceto our separate ways.  ""My Baby's Daddy"" isn't gonna bring us back in pairs, and in fact shows why I don't feel attached to urban comedy.  It's often being obnoxious, ignores fleshing its own stories, and doesn't bother abolishing expectations to makes its jokes original and truly hilarious; it's very two-dimensional, no way around it.""My Baby's Daddy"" is urban comedy at a mildew state.  The film has farts jokes for no reason besides having them, it incorporates the played-out-to-death white characters pretending to be black (and leads to a lousy punchline thatSeth Green did better), blatant stereotypes (herro Asian shopkeepers), and a nerd being taught to look fly and be the embarrassment to the whole neighborhood and my eyes.  Poorly delivered, unnecessary, offbeat, and dated, the movie's humor is like used diaper: it stinks. Speaking of diapers, the babies doesn't seem nothing more than plot devices just to distinguish a premise for guys like Anderson, Griffith, and Imperioli.  They're only apparent in two misguided scenes, one of which has the babies escape from the house like they're spies; I know the scene is meant to have the fathers become better parents, but the way it was set-up was ridiculous.  However, that isn't half as ludicrous as the scene in with Eddie Griffin's character Lonnie had a dinner for two and saw two babies talk to him; there is no point in having such a bizarre scene, he wasn't drunk, it was out-of-place and the effects to make the babies talk look ugly.I don't expect much from the cast, especially Eddie Griffith who's typically as funny as warm milk, but I do wonder why Michael Imperioli is involved in such a film.  Part of me feels bad for him, it seems as though outside ""The Sopranos, he's been gettinga stringof badluck. His performance in this film wasn't really up to snuff, but then again, the characters they're portraying are basically obnoxious, and the women they've been knocking up range from being unlikable, offensive, and unrealistic.To be fair, ""My Baby's Daddy"" is not nearly as bad as ""Norbit"".  It had a couple of hateful side characters like Rolanda, the mother of Lonnie's baby, but she not as frequent as Rasputia was in that Eddie Murphy disaster so I'm not bothered throughout the viewing.  At least this movie tried to have a sympathetic touch with the lead characters' growth and the story mostly stayed grounded...until it got to the absurd epilogues that had me rolling my eyes (how is 'Mofo Dojo' different from Tae Kwon Do?).  Nevertheless, the movie tried too hard to be silly, and it ended up doing a poor job as an immature comedy and a coming-of-age parenthood tale.

815160,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001WTWCY,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 8]","There's a long-standing rule of thumb in the motion picture business that the more writers who have a hand in making a movie the worse that movie will turn out to be.  In the case of ""My Baby's Daddy,"" it took four scenarists (who shall remain nameless) to come up with this excruciatingly bad multi-ethnic rip off of ""Three Men and a Baby.""  The plotting comes direct from the TV sitcom factory: three bachelors, who have never grown up into responsible adulthood, simultaneously find themselves the fathers of three adorable infants.  Naturally, after much initial bumbling and stumbling in the ways of parenthood, the three men learn what the true definition of manhood is.Though the movie has some fun lampooning racial and ethnic stereotypes, the humor is generally so bland, broad and formulaic that any promise the movie offers that it might somehow qualify as satire quickly evaporates.  Instead, the movie goes all soft and gooey, trying to get the audience to coo over the cute toddlers and sigh at the sight of three grown men who are themselves cooing over their toddlers.Considering the material that's been handed them, one hesitates to be too harsh on the actors who find themselves trapped in this mess.  However, because of guilt by association, the only people who escape entirely unscathed are the toddlers themselves, since they are clearly the only ones here still under the age of consent.",1,sitcom garbage,1088380800,"06 28, 2004",2004,1411,"['long-standing', 'rule', 'thumb', 'motion', 'picture', 'business', 'more', 'writers', 'who', 'have', 'hand', 'making', 'movie', 'worse', 'movie', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'case', 'Baby', 'Daddy', 'took', 'four', 'scenarists', 'who', 'shall', 'remain', 'nameless', 'come', 'up', 'excruciatingly', 'bad', 'multi-ethnic', 'rip', 'Three', 'Men', 'Baby', 'plotting', 'direct', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'factory', 'three', 'bachelors', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'grown', 'up', 'responsible', 'adulthood', 'simultaneously', 'find', 'fathers', 'three', 'adorable', 'infants', 'Naturally', 'much', 'initial', 'bumbling', 'stumbling', 'ways', 'parenthood', 'three', 'men', 'learn', 'what', 'true', 'definition', 'manhood', 'movie', 'fun', 'lampooning', 'racial', 'ethnic', 'stereotypes', 'humor', 'generally', 'so', 'bland', 'broad', 'formulaic', 'promise', 'movie', 'might', 'somehow', 'qualify', 'satire', 'quickly', 'Instead', 'movie', 'soft', 'gooey', 'trying', 'get', 'audience', 'coo', 'cute', 'toddlers', 'sigh', 'sight', 'three', 'grown', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'cooing', 'over', 'toddlers.Considering', 'material', 'been', 'handed', 'one', 'be', 'too', 'harsh', 'actors', 'who', 'find', 'trapped', 'mess', 'However', 'guilt', 'association', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'escape', 'entirely', 'unscathed', 'are', 'toddlers', 'are', 'clearly', 'only', 'ones', 'here', 'still', 'age', 'consent']",My Baby's Daddy

I can't beat up on this movie; it's not that Bad. My Baby's Daddy isn't the funniest movie, but at least its heart was in the right place. I give props to everyone for at least trying to make a film showing black men taking charge of their lives. Thanks to the heart and strong efforts of the cast and crew My Baby's Daddy overcomes its production obstacles and is overall a watchable entertaining movie. Mad props to Eddie Griffin and co for showing black men in a positive light and a balanced picture of black life in the ghetto. We need more efforts like this.The story follows three lifelong Philadelphia friends who are just coasting through life. Coincidentally their three girlfriends get pregnant and have their babies at the same time and give birth at the same time. From there we have hi-jinx and humor as the men learn moderation and adjust their quest for their dreams to fit their changing lives. The story has a happy ending that will leave the viewer satisfied.Production values on this movie are solid. The camera work is great and the editing is tight. Scenes transition into one another seamlessly, unlike some of those big budget action movies I've watched(*cough Daredevil, X2, X3, Cough). You feel like you're in the Philadelphia neighborhood hanging out with the fellas. Even though six writers worked on this screenplay the story is tight and cohesive with solid dialogue and a few funny lines.The acting here is pretty good, everyone does make an effort to make their characters convincing. Eddie Griffin, Anthony Anderson and Michael Imperioli are solid as the three dads. Method Man is hilarious for the short time he's onscreen. Bai Ling is very good as Anderson's girlfriend. She steals most of the scenes she's in and is often funnier than the guys in some cases. John Amos makes a great cameo as Uncle Bernie.My Baby's Daddy is worth a rental at best.

815162,A15MLF38WROSWU,B0001WTWCY,"S. M. Anderson ""sma331""","[1, 2]","I know people think this is a horrible film, and judging from the reviews I was actually nervous about watching it.  I took a chance and rented the movie to form my own opinion.  Three guys find out they will be fathers at the same time and try to deal with the changes that will occur in their life.  Lonnie (Eddie Griffin) is the nerd in the hood.  He is in love with Rolanda (Paula Jai Parker Friday, Phone Booth, Proud Family) who is a serious hoodrat, and lives with the momma hoodrat named Peaches.  Rolanda mistreats Lonnie every chance she gets.  He is working hard, but it's not enough, she wants him to give up more money, and he just takes it.  Not to mention while they having sex she is reading a magazine and faking it.  How pathetic is that?  G (Anthony Anderson) wants to be a boxer (now that in itself was comical) but he works for his girlfriends father.  Xi Xi's (Ling Bai Wild Wild West) father does not like G, and XiXi wants G to be more responsible now that they are about to become parents. Xi Xi expects G to give up his dream of becoming a boxer and help her with their child.  Dominic (Michael Imperioli, Sopranos) is a music exec who is a serious playa and not trying to settle down.  His one night stand with Nia (Joanna Bacalso, Snow Dogs, Woo) results in her expecting.  Nia wants to have the baby, and is very angry that Dominic does not want her to have the child.  Later in the film you find out that Nia is a Lesbian.  Guess being with someone like Dominic can lead you in that direction.I have to say my favorite scene in the film that made me laugh out loud was the birthing class scene.  When the instructor says ""Flatulence is normal during pregnancy"" and Rolanda let's loose I could not help but laugh.  Rolanda is so ghetto and classless when the instructor says to get into a comfortable position she goes on her hands and knees with the rest of the class looking at her like she is a fool.  Which she was.Then the instructor saying ""Child birth is to be a loving blissfull and wonderful experience,"" which leads to Rolanda screaming her head off in the delivery room is hilarious.Once the babies are born you get the usual funny scenes of trying to change the diapers, stopping them from crying, getting peed on, feedings and everything else that is involved with dealing with children.  G's character gets peed on twice by his son and crys ""I'm going blind.""  Can't help but chuckle at that, and then the poopy diaper scene is funny.  The guys still try to remain true to their bachelor lifestyles, and being fathers.  The men soon learn the two don't mix and they have to make some changes.  What was once priorities or important in their lives have to be shifted to accommodate being involved and loving fathers.Lonnie changes his image and he finally gets a backbone and stands up to Rolanda.  I was so happy when he finally told her off!!  The money he was giving her for their child she was using it to shop, and I was so upset by that.I also need to add the very beginning of the film is too cute with the animation as the introduction.The main problem I did have the movie and will always have are the stereotypes.  The whole ""Asian's can't speak proper English"" is truly played out and not funny.  If Asians made fun of black stereo types there would be a major uproar and we all know it.  I also had issues that during that party scene where the babies manage to get out of the room after someone left the door open by mistake.  Not one person noticed the babies, ever!!!  That just did not seem very realistic to me.The movie is not great, but there are some moments that will make you chuckle and some other moments I found funny.  I like the comedic spin of the movie, but the message is loud and clear.  You have to grow up, become a man and take care of your children!!!  It's worth a rental.  If watch this movie with no expectations you might find yourself surprised.  Method Man plays a character named No Good in the film and that's exactly what he was.  No Good!!!  I'm still trying to figure out how he could rob a toy store the way he did and not get in trouble?  John Amos plays Uncle Virgil in the film, the voice of reason and the father figure to Lonnie.  Mr. Amos is such a good actor.  I would really like to see him in better roles that display his talent.",3,This is actually a cute film,1106784000,"01 27, 2005",2005,4328,"['know', 'people', 'think', 'horrible', 'film', 'judging', 'reviews', 'was', 'actually', 'nervous', 'watching', 'took', 'chance', 'rented', 'movie', 'form', 'own', 'opinion', 'Three', 'guys', 'find', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'fathers', 'same', 'time', 'try', 'deal', 'changes', 'will', 'occur', 'life', 'Lonnie', 'Eddie', 'Griffin', 'nerd', 'hood', 'love', 'Rolanda', 'Paula', 'Jai', 'Parker', 'Friday', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'Proud', 'Family', 'who', 'serious', 'hoodrat', 'momma', 'hoodrat', 'named', 'Peaches', 'Rolanda', 'mistreats', 'Lonnie', 'chance', 'working', 'hard', 'not', 'enough', 'give', 'up', 'more', 'money', 'just', 'Not', 'mention', 'having', 'sex', 'reading', 'magazine', 'faking', 'How', 'pathetic', 'G', 'Anthony', 'Anderson', 'be', 'boxer', 'now', 'was', 'comical', 'girlfriends', 'father', 'Xi', 'Xi', 'Ling', 'Bai', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'father', 'not', 'G', 'XiXi', 'G', 'be', 'more', 'responsible', 'now', 'are', 'become', 'parents', 'Xi', 'Xi', 'G', 'give', 'up', 'dream', 'becoming', 'boxer', 'help', 'child', 'Dominic', 'Michael', 'Imperioli', 'Sopranos', 'music', 'exec', 'who', 'serious', 'playa', 'not', 'trying', 'settle', 'down', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'Nia', 'Joanna', 'Bacalso', 'Snow', 'Dogs', 'Woo', 'results', 'expecting', 'Nia', 'have', 'baby', 'very', 'angry', 'Dominic', 'not', 'want', 'have', 'child', 'Later', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'Nia', 'Lesbian', 'Guess', 'being', 'someone', 'Dominic', 'can', 'lead', 'direction.I', 'have', 'say', 'favorite', 'scene', 'film', 'made', 'loud', 'was', 'birthing', 'class', 'scene', 'When', 'instructor', 'Flatulence', 'normal', 'pregnancy', 'Rolanda', 'let', 'loose', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'laugh', 'Rolanda', 'so', 'ghetto', 'classless', 'when', 'instructor', 'get', 'comfortable', 'position', 'hands', 'knees', 'rest', 'class', 'looking', 'fool', 'Which', 'was.Then', 'instructor', 'saying', 'Child', 'birth', 'be', 'loving', 'blissfull', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'Rolanda', 'screaming', 'head', 'delivery', 'room', 'babies', 'are', 'born', 'get', 'usual', 'funny', 'scenes', 'trying', 'change', 'diapers', 'stopping', 'crying', 'getting', 'peed', 'feedings', 'everything', 'else', 'involved', 'dealing', 'children', 'G', 'character', 'peed', 'twice', 'son', 'crys', ""'m"", 'going', 'blind', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'chuckle', 'then', 'poopy', 'diaper', 'scene', 'funny', 'guys', 'still', 'try', 'remain', 'true', 'bachelor', 'lifestyles', 'being', 'fathers', 'men', 'soon', 'learn', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'mix', 'have', 'make', 'changes', 'What', 'was', 'once', 'priorities', 'important', 'lives', 'have', 'be', 'shifted', 'accommodate', 'being', 'involved', 'loving', 'fathers.Lonnie', 'changes', 'image', 'finally', 'backbone', 'up', 'Rolanda', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'when', 'finally', 'told', 'off', 'money', 'was', 'giving', 'child', 'was', 'using', 'shop', 'was', 'so', 'upset', 'that.I', 'also', 'need', 'add', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'too', 'cute', 'animation', 'introduction.The', 'main', 'problem', 'did', 'have', 'movie', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'whole', 'Asian', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'proper', 'English', 'truly', 'played', 'out', 'not', 'funny', 'Asians', 'made', 'fun', 'black', 'stereo', 'types', 'would', 'be', 'major', 'uproar', 'know', 'also', 'had', 'issues', 'party', 'scene', 'where', 'babies', 'manage', 'get', 'room', 'someone', 'left', 'door', 'open', 'mistake', 'Not', 'one', 'person', 'noticed', 'babies', 'ever', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'very', 'realistic', 'me.The', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'are', 'moments', 'will', 'make', 'chuckle', 'other', 'moments', 'found', 'funny', 'comedic', 'spin', 'movie', 'message', 'loud', 'clear', 'have', 'grow', 'up', 'become', 'man', 'take', 'care', 'children', 'rental', 'watch', 'movie', 'expectations', 'might', 'find', 'surprised', 'Method', 'Man', 'character', 'named', 'No', 'Good', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'Good', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'could', 'rob', 'toy', 'store', 'way', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'trouble', 'John', 'Amos', 'Uncle', 'Virgil', 'film', 'voice', 'reason', 'father', 'figure', 'Lonnie', 'Mr.', 'Amos', 'such', 'good', 'actor', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'see', 'better', 'roles', 'display', 'talent']",My Baby's Daddy
