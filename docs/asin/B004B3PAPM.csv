I grew up watching them on TV and have come to love them as well.  Nelson still had a great, booming voice.  He and Gale Sherwood had good chemistry and she had a wonderful voice.  Watching them together gives you an idea of their nightclub act.  Considering this was taped off a live TV performance I am amazed at how well this stands up.  For live TV the sets were very good.  Also fun to see Bambi Linn dancing, she was quite a sprite of a dancer!

Shepard ""shep716""","[7, 7]","Devotees of theatre and musicals know there is worthy interest in this desert romance saga, from the early stage play at the turn to the 20th century ""The Red Shadow"" through the 1929ish movie, and the finally, glorious movie of 1953 with Gordon MacRae and the delicious Kathryn Grayson, a coloratura contender for the ""Best Ingenue of all Time."" Macrae was very good, Grayson, fantastic, but the plot sequence of the '53 movie was altered, stripping many of the beautiful songs and dances out.  That was a neutering of the story.  In this Eddy version, filmed on a stage presentation, the original plot sequences and all the missing songs AND DANCES -- scrapped from the 1953 movie -- are gloriously restored.  Eddy was slowing down but still in excellent voice and Gale Sherwood was marvelous, not as pure as Grayson, but excellent nonetheless. One cannot fairly criticize the video of a well-staged stage presentation.  The players are not in a real desert:  they're on a stage! This is a faithful presentation of the original plot AND MUSIC and should please devotees, aficiandos and new lovers of musical theatre.",5,A fulfilling presentation of a grand play & musical,1317945600,"10 7, 2011",2011,1118,"['Devotees', 'theatre', 'musicals', 'know', 'worthy', 'interest', 'desert', 'romance', 'saga', 'early', 'stage', 'play', 'turn', '20th', 'century', 'Red', 'Shadow', '1929ish', 'movie', 'finally', 'glorious', 'movie', '1953', 'Gordon', 'MacRae', 'delicious', 'Kathryn', 'Grayson', 'coloratura', 'contender', 'Best', 'Ingenue', 'Time', 'Macrae', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Grayson', 'fantastic', 'plot', 'sequence', ""'53"", 'movie', 'was', 'altered', 'stripping', 'many', 'beautiful', 'songs', 'dances', 'out', 'was', 'neutering', 'story', 'Eddy', 'version', 'filmed', 'stage', 'presentation', 'original', 'plot', 'sequences', 'missing', 'songs', 'DANCES', 'scrapped', '1953', 'movie', 'are', 'gloriously', 'restored', 'Eddy', 'was', 'slowing', 'down', 'still', 'excellent', 'voice', 'Gale', 'Sherwood', 'was', 'marvelous', 'not', 'as', 'pure', 'Grayson', 'excellent', 'nonetheless', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'fairly', 'criticize', 'video', 'well-staged', 'stage', 'presentation', 'players', 'are', 'not', 'real', 'desert', ""'re"", 'stage', 'faithful', 'presentation', 'original', 'plot', 'AND', 'MUSIC', 'should', 'please', 'devotees', 'aficiandos', 'new', 'lovers', 'musical', 'theatre']",The Desert Song

Supposedly it was 1921, but the women were all in 1955 dress plus absurd harem garb. Second was the hoky and over-long pseudo-Arabic dances. BUT, hey, all balanced out with wonderful Nelson Eddy.

1394187,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B004B3PAPM,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[7, 7]","Singer Nelson Eddy is most associated with Jeanette MacDonald because they made so many filmed operettas together. These films play on TV often and have been available for years. Less known is that Eddy performed a television adaptation of Sigmund Romberg's classic The Desert Song in 1955, produced and directed by Max Liebman - the man responsible for the classic Sid Caesar variety show, Your Show of Shows. Liebman produced a series of ""specials"" for NBC in the 1950s under the title Max Liebman Presents and, lucky for us they were recorded on videotape (early videotape!). This performance of The Desert Song is finally available on DVD and it's a joy to watch. Sure it's in black and white. That's what TV was in 1955! And, yes, there are a few blurry spots to the edges of the screen but that was what it looked like when it was aired. Remember broadcast television wasn't even a decade old at this time. The sound quality for this time period is superb and I noted no distortion, even on the high notes sung by Eddy and his post-MacDonald singing partner, Gale Sherwood. The supporting cast is excellent as well.  There are four dance numbers - in different styles - choreographed by Rod Alexander and featuring him with partner Bambi Linn, who often appeared on Liebman's Show of Shows.There's not a lot of dialogue among the singing but Eddy carries it off well. Because the TV version had to fit into a 90-minute slot, and there were cars to be sold (Oldsmobile was the sponsor, but the commercials do not appear on the DVD), the plot had to be edited and adapted down to 78 minutes. One of the three adaptors was another from Libeman's stable: playwright Neil Simon! This was the ""Golden Age of Television"".VAI's release of this show deserves thunderous applause for give us the best copy available. The DVD is indexed properly so that you can find specific songs upon repeat viewing. Add to this a delightful (though fantasy) love story -the French and the Spanish and the Moroccans all speak with East Coast accents! - and this DVD is a winner.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,A rare treat - the Golden Age of Television and Nelson Eddy live!,1296172800,"01 28, 2011",2011,2092,"['Singer', 'Nelson', 'Eddy', 'most', 'associated', 'Jeanette', 'MacDonald', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'filmed', 'operettas', 'together', 'films', 'play', 'TV', 'often', 'have', 'been', 'available', 'years', 'Less', 'known', 'Eddy', 'performed', 'television', 'adaptation', 'Sigmund', 'Romberg', 'classic', 'Desert', 'Song', '1955', 'produced', 'directed', 'Max', 'Liebman', 'man', 'responsible', 'classic', 'Sid', 'Caesar', 'variety', 'show', 'Your', 'Show', 'Shows', 'Liebman', 'produced', 'series', 'specials', 'NBC', '1950s', 'title', 'Max', 'Liebman', 'Presents', 'lucky', 'were', 'recorded', 'videotape', 'early', 'videotape', 'performance', 'Desert', 'Song', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD', 'joy', 'watch', 'Sure', 'black', 'white', 'what', 'TV', 'was', '1955', 'yes', 'are', 'few', 'blurry', 'spots', 'edges', 'screen', 'was', 'what', 'looked', 'when', 'was', 'aired', 'Remember', 'broadcast', 'television', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'decade', 'old', 'time', 'sound', 'quality', 'time', 'period', 'superb', 'noted', 'distortion', 'even', 'high', 'notes', 'sung', 'Eddy', 'post-MacDonald', 'singing', 'partner', 'Gale', 'Sherwood', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'four', 'dance', 'numbers', 'different', 'styles', 'choreographed', 'Rod', 'Alexander', 'featuring', 'partner', 'Bambi', 'Linn', 'who', 'often', 'appeared', 'Liebman', 'Show', 'Shows.There', 'not', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'singing', 'Eddy', 'off', 'well', 'TV', 'version', 'had', 'fit', '90-minute', 'slot', 'were', 'cars', 'be', 'sold', 'Oldsmobile', 'was', 'sponsor', 'commercials', 'do', 'not', 'appear', 'DVD', 'plot', 'had', 'be', 'edited', 'adapted', 'down', '78', 'minutes', 'One', 'three', 'adaptors', 'was', 'Libeman', 'stable', 'playwright', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'was', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Television', '.VAI', 'release', 'show', 'thunderous', 'applause', 'give', 'best', 'copy', 'available', 'DVD', 'indexed', 'properly', 'so', 'can', 'find', 'specific', 'songs', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'Add', 'delightful', 'fantasy', 'love', 'story', '-the', 'French', 'Spanish', 'Moroccans', 'speak', 'East', 'Coast', 'accents', 'DVD', 'winner.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",The Desert Song
