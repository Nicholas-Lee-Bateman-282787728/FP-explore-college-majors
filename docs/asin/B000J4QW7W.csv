Heather (Ashanti) is the head cheerleader, Carrie (Arielle Kebbel, also from Aquamarine) is the brainy one with lots of extra-curricular activities and Beth (Sophia Bush) is all for saving the animals and free love.  By chance the three find out about each other during a volleyball game, and the sparks begin flying.Kate (Snow) knows all about fickle men, having witnessed her mom (Jenny McCarthy) go through more than her fair share of them, but when she tries to play the peacemaker, the three battling beauties persuade her to take part in a revenge scheme which transforms her from being invisible to something more in their own image.Unfortunately, their early schemes don't quite work out as planned, forcing the four to change strategy in mid stream and hatch a master plan carefully calculated to bring the enemy to his knees.Funny in places, but largely predictable, this one is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours when you've nothing better to do.Rated: 3.5 starsAmanda Richards, November 26, 2006",3,Playin' the playa,1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,1410,"['fairly', 'average', 'teen', 'comedy', 'involving', 'rich', 'athletic', 'handsome', 'hunk', 'manhood', 'Jesse', 'Metcalfe', 'three', 'hot', 'girls', 'dating', 'concurrently', 'quiet', 'nondescript', 'new', 'student', 'Brittany', 'Snow', '.John', 'Tucker', 'Metcalfe', 'playing', 'three', 'girls', 'same', 'time', 'carefully', 'choosing', 'different', 'spheres', 'school', 'activity', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'come', 'contact', 'other', 'Heather', 'Ashanti', 'head', 'cheerleader', 'Carrie', 'Arielle', 'Kebbel', 'also', 'Aquamarine', 'brainy', 'one', 'lots', 'extra-curricular', 'activities', 'Beth', 'Sophia', 'Bush', 'saving', 'animals', 'free', 'love', 'chance', 'three', 'find', 'out', 'other', 'volleyball', 'game', 'sparks', 'begin', 'flying.Kate', 'Snow', 'fickle', 'men', 'having', 'witnessed', 'mom', 'Jenny', 'McCarthy', 'go', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'when', 'play', 'peacemaker', 'three', 'battling', 'beauties', 'persuade', 'take', 'part', 'revenge', 'scheme', 'being', 'invisible', 'something', 'more', 'own', 'image.Unfortunately', 'early', 'schemes', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'out', 'planned', 'forcing', 'four', 'change', 'strategy', 'mid', 'stream', 'hatch', 'master', 'plan', 'carefully', 'calculated', 'bring', 'enemy', 'knees.Funny', 'places', 'largely', 'predictable', 'one', 'pleasant', 'way', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours', 'when', ""'ve"", 'nothing', 'better', 'do.Rated', '3.5', 'starsAmanda', 'Richards', 'November', '26', '2006']",N/A
1024933,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,B000J4QW7W,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[29, 32]","With little to do in an unfamiliar town, I found myself sitting in a familiar place: a movie theater. My only choice was seeing John Tucker Must Die, which I'll admit I was less than thrilled to see. I just hoped that I hadn't wasted 8 bucks to eat overpriced popcorn. And I was pleasantly surprised: John Tucker Must Die is actually funny and cute. Granted, the title gives off an edgy feel, something this movie is completely devoid of, instead being a chick flicky, teen comedy in the same vein as 10 Things I Hate About You.Kate (Brittany Snow) is the new girl at school. Her mom (Jenny McCarthy) has a tendency to skip town when things get rough in her love life (a la Hilary Duff's mom in The Perfect Man), so Kate is pretty clueless when it comes to love. Which is what makes her the perfect vessel for three girls to use in order to get back at John Tucker, who had been dating all three of them. So they set their seemingly evil plan in motion: get John Tucker to fall for Kate and then break his heart. But what happens when Kate begins thinking that there is more than meets the eye with John Tucker? That maybe, just maybe, he actually DOES like her and she actually likes him? Don't get too excited about a possible romance between Kate and John because there's another Tucker that Kate has her eye on. And he has his eye on her.Instead of teetering between edgy and cute, the movie really should've picked a side and owned it. Edgy or cute. Pick one. Brittany Snow is absolutely adorable. She has that Reese Witherspoon quality about her, making you like her no matter what she does. And Jesse Metcalfe as John Tucker? Well, he's nice to look at, but I wonder why he left Desperate Housewives to, well, act in a movie that could be called Desperate Teenagers. Oh well.

Because the movie didn't fall for the usual tricks that teenager movies normally do- immature violence, lots of dirty swear words, and sex.  All those topics were surprisingly avoided and instead the writers opted to go for a much more acceptable and cleaner storyline.  Did it work?  Well, sort of.I have to agree with the reviewer who mentions the similarities to Saved By The Bell.  It was pretty much just like that old TV show in every way.  As a young adult, I'm happy my teenage years are over and don't want to think about the past and the way I used to be back then, so for people who are also in the same boat, you probably won't find anything about the movie to really win you over.  You'll just think ""Oh yeah, I used to act like that"" and be done with it.

What once was scary and chilling in horror is now obsessed with buckets of gore(Hostel, Wolf Creek, Hills Have Eyes) and it seems we can't even do romantic comedies anymore. While this film isn't exactly revolutionary for the genre, it's one of those weird highlights that becomes strangely better than it's other brethren. Is it a comedy highlight? Definately not but is it better than most? In an absurd way...it actually is.John Tucker has everything: star of baseketball team and has many great girlfriends. Only problem: he dates them all at the same time since each girl belongs to a different clique and they'd never speak to each other long enough to tell them their boyfriend's name. Once they found out though, it's revenge(no they don't kill him, it's an ironic title) but rather get socially ignored Kate to date him than break his heart. Of course, as usual with romantic comedies: easier said than done.What the film nails is in its casting. We have 4 hotties playing the main group of vindictive ladies with Arielle Kebbel, Brittany Snow, Sophia Bush and even Ashanti. Somehow they make the film un-girly and make it accessible to a guy, such as myself, without making it so bubblegum sweet your dentist will start hating you. Playing the guy-in-crosshairs is Jesse Metcalfe, Eva Longoria's affair from Desperate Housewives. While he's not exactly the most ranged actor, there's something endearing about him, even while wearing ladies' thongs or acting like a big mama's boy in one scene.Is the film funny? To be honest, not really? The film's not necessarily a laugh riot so much as it is an enjoyable one. It's likable and accessible enough but it's not something that'll have you howling with laughter which is a shame. Scenes like John Tucker wearing Victoria's Secret looking thongs didn't really have an hysterical mood but rather just a really cute or amusing one, like all you'd get was a smirk. But while that scene doesn't fall flat, Brittany Snow in similar underwear doesn't. My inner guyness I suppose.Should you rent it?

Even Ashanti, with her questionable acting abilities, manages to come  off un-hate-able.So, when John Tucker becomes the object of the three jilted lovers rejection... it is hard to actually care if they succeed because Mr. Tucker (played adorably by Jesse Metcalf) is so damn likeable. At the same time, you don't want to see the plan fail because the three vixens are also root-worthy.Enter Kate (an effective and talented Brittany Snow) a high school hottie who has been invisible all her life for some odd reason. When she gets caught up in the explosive love square, her status changes as she gets dragged into the forray to help them get back at their jilter. She doesn't get a make-over per-se, but she is taught a new way of showing attitude and joins the cheer leading squad (even though she is like-so against it) all to bring Tucker down.Of course, in typical comedic-teen-revenge movies, hijinx ensues and nothing really goes according to plan.

1024947,A2BJ9I0BQ1LH5S,B000J4QW7W,guitarchick24,"[0, 0]","After seeing so many previews of this movie on other DVDs, I decided to give it a try.  Touted as being ""as cool as Mean Girls,"" the movie is about man-about-town John Tucker and what happens when three of the most influential girls in school (who also happen to each be his ""secret girlfriend"") decide to take John down a peg or two.  Using new girl Kate to break his heart, Kate gets caught up in the social whirlwind of her new high school as she goes from anonymous to the it girl.The premise is fun and if you don't think about the movie too hard, there are a lot of funny moments.  Many of the girls' plots revolve around embarrassing John to make him lose credibility in front of his basketball teammates and, ultimately, the entire school.  But as their revenge plots escalate in wackiness, John's cool factor keeps going up.However, the writers introduce a lot of loose ends that they never wrap up by the end of the movie.  They also ask the viewers to stretch their imaginations way too far.As an example - an early revenge plot involves switching John's health supplement with estrogen powder.  After liberal doses, John starts acting like, well, a woman with PMS.  I highly doubt that the powder would have an effect that quickly and make you lash out emotionally.But the place where the writers dropped the ball revolves around Kate's relationships with her mother and with the ""other Tucker,"" John's brother Scott.  Kate and her mother barely talk in the movie (just one or two heart-to-hearts that are very superficial), so the changes in Kate's mother's behavior seem very abrupt.  And Scott is introduced early in the movie, and you expect something to develop... and then they just put his character on hold while Kate ""pursues"" John.I think the movie would have been stronger if Kate and Scott's relationship had developed more, so when Kate comes clean, it's not completely about her and her lies, but also because she would rather have a real relationship with a better man.At least in ""Mean Girls"" the Plastics all learn something and grow from the experience.  By movie's end, it doesn't seem that any of the characters from ""John Tucker Must Die"" have learned anything.Recommended as a rental on a rainy day, if you can't find anything better on the shelf.",2,A mixed bag of a movie,1194825600,"11 12, 2007",2007,2281,"['seeing', 'so', 'many', 'previews', 'movie', 'other', 'DVDs', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'Touted', 'being', 'as', 'cool', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'movie', 'man-about-town', 'John', 'Tucker', 'what', 'when', 'three', 'most', 'influential', 'girls', 'school', 'who', 'also', 'happen', 'be', 'secret', 'girlfriend', 'decide', 'take', 'John', 'down', 'peg', 'two', 'Using', 'new', 'girl', 'Kate', 'break', 'heart', 'Kate', 'caught', 'up', 'social', 'whirlwind', 'new', 'high', 'school', 'anonymous', 'girl.The', 'premise', 'fun', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'too', 'hard', 'are', 'lot', 'funny', 'moments', 'Many', 'girls', 'plots', 'revolve', 'embarrassing', 'John', 'make', 'lose', 'credibility', 'front', 'basketball', 'teammates', 'ultimately', 'entire', 'school', 'revenge', 'plots', 'escalate', 'wackiness', 'John', 'cool', 'factor', 'going', 'up.However', 'writers', 'introduce', 'lot', 'loose', 'ends', 'never', 'wrap', 'up', 'end', 'movie', 'also', 'ask', 'viewers', 'stretch', 'imaginations', 'way', 'too', 'example', 'early', 'revenge', 'plot', 'switching', 'John', 'health', 'supplement', 'estrogen', 'powder', 'liberal', 'doses', 'John', 'acting', 'well', 'woman', 'PMS', 'highly', 'doubt', 'powder', 'would', 'have', 'effect', 'quickly', 'make', 'lash', 'out', 'place', 'where', 'writers', 'dropped', 'ball', 'around', 'Kate', 'relationships', 'mother', 'other', 'Tucker', 'John', 'brother', 'Scott', 'Kate', 'mother', 'barely', 'talk', 'movie', 'just', 'one', 'two', 'heart-to-hearts', 'are', 'very', 'superficial', 'changes', 'Kate', 'mother', 'behavior', 'seem', 'very', 'abrupt', 'Scott', 'introduced', 'early', 'movie', 'expect', 'something', 'develop', 'then', 'just', 'put', 'character', 'hold', 'Kate', 'pursues', 'John.I', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'Kate', 'Scott', 'relationship', 'had', 'developed', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'Kate', 'clean', 'not', 'completely', 'lies', 'also', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'real', 'relationship', 'better', 'man.At', 'least', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'Plastics', 'learn', 'something', 'grow', 'experience', 'movie', 'end', ""n't"", 'seem', 'characters', 'John', 'Tucker', 'Must', 'Die', 'have', 'learned', 'anything.Recommended', 'rental', 'rainy', 'day', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'better', 'shelf']",N/A

I can't say that I enjoyed it as much, since it IS a chick flick, but there were some positives for the male viewer.First and foremost, the cast is full of eye candy.  Arrielle Kebbel (American Pie Band Camp), Sophia Bush (The Hitcher), and Ashanti are the assorted hot chicks at school.  They hardly know each other but they are in the same social stratosphere that causes one to be unaware of others.  In comes Brittany Snow (Prom Night) to round out the foursome.  Every scene has one of them in it, and the rest of the girls in school are 20 year old models from every conceivable cultural background.The four prance around in form-fitting, skimpy outfits, two even dressed as cheerleaders, and generally look hot the entire movie, prancing around after the local Big Man on Campus: John Tucker.  He's essentially a lesser version of the same guy from Sixteen Candles (What?  It's a John Hughes flick!).  Besides, even if the guy lead isn't up to par, each and every female cast member is a gargantuan upgrade over that ginger beast Molly Ringwald.Anyway, JT has already hooked up with the three queens of school, and he has his eyes set on the new chick.  All three old conquests want to use this to their advantage to ruin JT.  They all eventually learn a lesson everyone should learn: relationship games only end up causing problems.  The games eventually cause a few incredibly ridiculous scenes, like the entire male population of a high school wearing thongs.The best parts of this movie are on the basketball court.  Not sinceTeen Wolfhave more ridiculous scenes been filmed.  JT evidently has a 65 inch vertical leap, and every other player has the coordination of a drunken roller skater.  He even does a completely impossible front-flip dunk, an atrocity that no male audience can let pass.With a wet t-shirt scene at the end of the movie that turns into a bunch of hot chicks smearing stripper cake all over one another, how bad can it be?",3,Mean Girls are Clueless,1235779200,"02 28, 2009",2009,2054,"['watched', 'while', 'back', 'group', 'women', 'who', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'beginning', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enjoyed', 'much', 'chick', 'flick', 'were', 'positives', 'male', 'viewer.First', 'foremost', 'cast', 'full', 'eye', 'candy', 'Arrielle', 'Kebbel', 'American', 'Pie', 'Band', 'Camp', 'Sophia', 'Bush', 'Hitcher', 'Ashanti', 'are', 'assorted', 'hot', 'chicks', 'school', 'hardly', 'know', 'other', 'are', 'same', 'social', 'stratosphere', 'one', 'be', 'unaware', 'others', 'Brittany', 'Snow', 'Prom', 'Night', 'round', 'out', 'foursome', 'scene', 'one', 'rest', 'girls', 'school', 'are', '20', 'year', 'old', 'models', 'conceivable', 'cultural', 'background.The', 'four', 'prance', 'around', 'form-fitting', 'skimpy', 'outfits', 'two', 'even', 'dressed', 'cheerleaders', 'generally', 'look', 'hot', 'entire', 'movie', 'prancing', 'around', 'local', 'Big', 'Man', 'Campus', 'John', 'Tucker', 'essentially', 'lesser', 'version', 'same', 'guy', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'What', 'John', 'Hughes', 'flick', 'even', 'guy', 'lead', ""n't"", 'up', 'par', 'female', 'cast', 'member', 'gargantuan', 'upgrade', 'ginger', 'beast', 'Molly', 'Ringwald.Anyway', 'JT', 'already', 'hooked', 'up', 'three', 'queens', 'school', 'eyes', 'set', 'new', 'chick', 'three', 'old', 'conquests', 'want', 'use', 'advantage', 'ruin', 'JT', 'eventually', 'learn', 'lesson', 'everyone', 'should', 'learn', 'relationship', 'games', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'causing', 'problems', 'games', 'eventually', 'cause', 'few', 'incredibly', 'ridiculous', 'scenes', 'entire', 'male', 'population', 'high', 'school', 'wearing', 'thongs.The', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'basketball', 'court', 'Not', 'sinceTeen', 'Wolfhave', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'scenes', 'been', 'filmed', 'JT', 'evidently', '65', 'inch', 'vertical', 'leap', 'other', 'player', 'coordination', 'drunken', 'roller', 'skater', 'even', 'completely', 'impossible', 'front-flip', 'dunk', 'atrocity', 'male', 'audience', 'can', 'let', 'pass.With', 'wet', 't-shirt', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'bunch', 'hot', 'chicks', 'smearing', 'stripper', 'cake', 'one', 'how', 'bad', 'can', 'be']",N/A

In the 80s, for some odd reason, we enjoyed this. It was fun. It was, at times, funny.Now, 20 years later, it's not so funny. It's banal. Not tried and true; rather, tired, true, and overcooked.Here are some things that could not possibly have happened:1. Brittany Snow (Kate Spencer) as an unappealing girl/young women. Please. I don't care how socially retarded she may have been, she's a beautiful girl from head to toe. If I were in high school with her, I'd crush on her.2. The overblown athletic acrobatics.

1024959,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B000J4QW7W,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[24, 28]","John Tucker Must Die is just like all the other teen comedies of our time.  We have the wallflower, Kate (played by Brittany Snow), who feels invisible because her mother is constantly moving them around on her search for the perfect man.  Because she moves around so much, she feels invisible in school and finds it hard being the new girl.  She desperately wants to fit in and decides to try harder.At her new school a guy named John Tucker is the most popular guy--captain of the basketball team, loaded parents, the whole shebang.  Her job as a waitress at the local restaurant lets her see the fact that John wines and dines a different girl every night of the week, all of them completely oblivious to the fact that he's cheating on them. He dates one of each high school stereotype: the pretty head cheerleader, Heather (Ashanti), the smart reporter, Carrie (Arielle Kebbel), and the vegan activist/whore, Beth (Sophia Bush).  When they discover that they're getting played, the triumvirate bands together with Kate's help to give John a taste of his own medicine.This movie is fun and cute, but just another teen movie.  Think of any of the elements that made high school cinema great and they're present in this movie. The team of popular girls who get together to make the wallflower cute and popular (Heathers, Jawbreaker); the cute quirky guy who can never seem to get the girl (10 Things I Hate About You, Bring It On); and the moral that popularity isn't really everything and you should just be yourself (Clueless, Mean Girls).  It was a lighthearted comedy with plenty of laughs and some nice shots of Jesse Metcalfe in a thong.  I think this would be fun for the same people who liked the movies mentioned above and those who don't take it too seriously.",3,Just another teen movie,1153872000,"07 26, 2006",2006,1771,"['John', 'Tucker', 'Must', 'Die', 'just', 'other', 'teen', 'comedies', 'time', 'have', 'wallflower', 'Kate', 'played', 'Brittany', 'Snow', 'who', 'invisible', 'mother', 'constantly', 'moving', 'around', 'search', 'perfect', 'man', 'around', 'so', 'much', 'invisible', 'school', 'hard', 'being', 'new', 'girl', 'desperately', 'fit', 'decides', 'try', 'harder.At', 'new', 'school', 'guy', 'named', 'John', 'Tucker', 'most', 'popular', 'guy', 'captain', 'basketball', 'team', 'loaded', 'parents', 'whole', 'shebang', 'job', 'waitress', 'local', 'restaurant', 'see', 'fact', 'John', 'wines', 'different', 'girl', 'night', 'week', 'completely', 'oblivious', 'fact', 'cheating', 'one', 'high', 'school', 'stereotype', 'pretty', 'head', 'cheerleader', 'Heather', 'Ashanti', 'smart', 'reporter', 'Carrie', 'Arielle', 'Kebbel', 'vegan', 'activist/whore', 'Beth', 'Sophia', 'Bush', 'When', 'discover', ""'re"", 'getting', 'played', 'triumvirate', 'together', 'Kate', 'help', 'give', 'John', 'taste', 'own', 'medicine.This', 'movie', 'fun', 'cute', 'just', 'teen', 'movie', 'Think', 'elements', 'made', 'high', 'school', 'cinema', 'great', ""'re"", 'present', 'movie', 'team', 'popular', 'girls', 'who', 'get', 'together', 'make', 'wallflower', 'cute', 'popular', 'Heathers', 'Jawbreaker', 'cute', 'quirky', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'never', 'seem', 'get', 'girl', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'Bring', 'moral', 'popularity', ""n't"", 'really', 'everything', 'should', 'just', 'be', 'Clueless', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'was', 'lighthearted', 'comedy', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'nice', 'shots', 'Jesse', 'Metcalfe', 'thong', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'liked', 'movies', 'mentioned', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously']",N/A

1024976,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000J4QW7W,Samuel McKewon,"[5, 29]","Never mind's that it's pretty stupid - ""John Tucker Must Die,"" like a lot of movies about high-schoolers, actually hates high school and just about everybody in it, and by extension, American kids; it's the kind of movie that, if parents caught an hour of it, would make them think less of their children for watching it, and to a fearsome extent, pretending to live it out. Early in the movie one character, a cheerleader, remarks about stealing her mother's estrogen pills: ""Well, guys use steroids to build their pecs."" That estrogen will do the same for the cheerleader's breasts is laughable, but considering the hot debate of steroid use among kids - considering kids have died or flown into abusive rages while using them - that could be most casual, sickening line of the year.But it is what to expect from Hollywood screenwriters in their 30s who write exploitative trash for money then have the artistic gall to call it mild, girlie comedy - not unlike those fabulous ""Laguna Beach"" hacks who use insidious, and I mean insidious, editing techniques to create faux docudrama among teens with facial expressions and confused responses clearly mismatched, again and again in the sloppiest manner, to the previous line of dialogue. ""JTMD"" asks us to believe that the title character (Jesse Metcalf) simultaneously dates three women (Ashanti, Sophia Bush, Arielle Kebbel) without them knowing it, is able to afford repeated dinners at the nicest restaurant in town, owns a great car, stays in four-star hotels for high-school basketball road games, and my personal favorite, owns and drives a yacht. He and his brother have no parents to speak of.Neither do the three girls, unless you count the cheerleader's mom reference. One of them (Bush) is an avowed 17-year-old vegan vixen, however. And when they discover they've all been dating the same guy in gym class, they get in a brawl and are not suspended, but sent to a 23-minute detention without a teacher.Is this a satire, as ""JTMD"" bills itself? An edgy comedy? A smarter, cleverer film knows that teachers hand out discipline, in this post-Columbine world, for looking at each other funny, and that a brawl would constitute the lead story in the six o'clock news. A cleverer film has the girls chase not a superstar athlete, but, say head of the drama club. A cleverer film recognizes teen humor is mined not out of blase, ultra-hardened brat girls, but sweet, emotional, sunny girls. A cleverer film would know a dark comedy, if that's what ""JTMD"" intends to be, can't have cheesy lines and yachts sitting around to be driven.Instead we have a fourth, ""smart"" girl (Brittany Snow) is introduced as the girls' grand, ""Taming of the Shrew"" plan to woo John and eventually stomp his heart. This angel, of course, begins to fall for John, who is not particularly charming or interesting or anything beyond possessive and very wealthy, which are, if we follow our MTV, two of the trinity (the last being sheer, drop-dead cuteness emanating from those soulful eyes said guys must have, preferably brown) that makes up male desirability. Director Betty Thomas pretends that humor are four very different idiots insulting each other over the cliques they belong to. Ashanti gets the shortest end of the stick, adhering fiercely to the idea that cheerleading, in an empowered, open society that has a foreign Hindu woman as CEO of Pepsi, represents the canopy of female of achievement. Go figure - you break the glass ceiling with a cheer pyramid!We've been pounding this Earth for years now. Why do teens and young women still trail along, lapping it up? There is no real wit in the movie that you can't see from some third-rate comic being fed lines on a VH1 program, no style, no genuine attitude. It's all buried behind this driving notion of painting a portrait of a catty, young, rotten, unidealistic America most interested in getting tail, getting even and throwing s-uh-weet hoopty-rah parties. It is not immoral so much as it blank, a double zero signififying an unceasing period of meaningless motions to mimic, most involving self-debasement of young bodies. What fools Hollywood sees our children to be, wants them to be. What numb, donkey fools. If you need more proof, Jenny McCarthy has been cast as the voice of reason - and she's borderline believable.Ya know, so much ugliness is spewed about ""Islamofascists,"" these manaical, stoneaged fiends who apparently can't tell you the sky is blue, spending most of their time taping martyr videos, finding Mecca and concocting devices to destroy our way of life. Consider, though, that one of the more recognizable items in Muslim countries is the satellite dish . A year from now, this thing's on a movie channel, and well, whatever evidence terroritsts thought they needed to chart the American decline into shame, they've got it. Not because it's absent morals, but humanity - the better for the terrorists to treat us as the faceless collateral damage they believe us to be.",1,"Another teen movie, by adults, that hates

Their plot for revenge against John Tucker takes some interesting turns of course, and I don't want to ruin the scenes that ensue from all this, but when the girls realize their little plans keep backfiring, they hatch a new scheme...to make John Tucker fall for Kate, who is impervious to his womanzing ways, thanks to watching her mom's serial dating over the years.
