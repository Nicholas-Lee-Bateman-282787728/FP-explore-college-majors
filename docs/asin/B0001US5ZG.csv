812950,A14NAEWHKBW1NF,B0001US5ZG,"hippiedj ""hippiedj""","[5, 11]","MTI Home Video should be ashamed for trying to deceive horror buffs, as The Wind is a very dark DRAMA, and quite a strange, oddly compelling one. Those of us that enjoy films like this one would have been speaking out more had the company tried to market it truthfully.  For example, MTI changed the original tagline from ""Love comes in many forms"" to ""Terror comes in many forms"" ... so you can see how many viewers felt mislead.The ""wind"" in this film is a metaphor for society, and is the story of four friends who make some bad choices and how thier lives quickly turn into ones of desperate self-preservation.  After going too far in 'teaching a lesson' to one of their own, a death occurs and each person tries to save his/her own standing.  Manipulation between them becomes the norm, and by the end we see how self-preservation becomes their main motivation over good judgment.  From civilized to savage, basically.  The film manages to get messages across without being heavy-handed, though you can spot many symbols and meaningful dialogue throughout.What works well in this film's favor are the ""unknown"" actors.  It works better when you have lesser known, capable actors instead of being distracted by big stars.  You can actually get drawn into the story and forget these aren't real people.  Use of locations (a forest, wide open fields, cozy homes) all add to the strange feel of another universe entirely.  Very much like the landscapes of The Reflecting Skin.For those of us that ""got"" the intentions of this film, The Wind is a breath of fresh air (no pun intended) in a time when most films are just made to rake in the bucks and ""compete"" to be mentioned on Entertainment Tonight as the top film draw of the week.  Years later, it's great little films like this one that stay in my mind, not processed blockbusters.Get past the bad marketing ploy from the video distributor, and you just might find this an engaging story indeed.  I strongly recommend it to friends that seek out unusual films like this one.",5,"Compelling drama, despite deceptive marketing from MTI",1085616000,"05 27, 2004",2004,2029,"['MTI', 'Home', 'Video', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'trying', 'deceive', 'horror', 'buffs', 'Wind', 'very', 'dark', 'DRAMA', 'quite', 'strange', 'oddly', 'compelling', 'one', 'enjoy', 'films', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'speaking', 'out', 'more', 'had', 'company', 'tried', 'market', 'truthfully', 'example', 'MTI', 'changed', 'original', 'tagline', 'Love', 'many', 'forms', 'Terror', 'many', 'forms', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'viewers', 'felt', 'mislead.The', 'wind', 'film', 'metaphor', 'society', 'story', 'four', 'friends', 'who', 'make', 'bad', 'choices', 'how', 'thier', 'quickly', 'turn', 'ones', 'desperate', 'self-preservation', 'going', 'too', 'far', ""'teaching"", 'lesson', 'one', 'own', 'death', 'occurs', 'person', 'save', 'own', 'standing', 'Manipulation', 'norm', 'end', 'see', 'how', 'self-preservation', 'main', 'motivation', 'good', 'judgment', 'civilized', 'savage', 'basically', 'film', 'get', 'messages', 'being', 'heavy-handed', 'can', 'spot', 'many', 'symbols', 'meaningful', 'dialogue', 'well', 'film', 'favor', 'are', 'unknown', 'actors', 'better', 'when', 'have', 'lesser', 'known', 'capable', 'actors', 'instead', 'being', 'distracted', 'big', 'stars', 'can', 'actually', 'get', 'drawn', 'story', 'forget', 'are', ""n't"", 'real', 'people', 'Use', 'locations', 'forest', 'wide', 'open', 'fields', 'cozy', 'homes', 'add', 'strange', 'feel', 'universe', 'entirely', 'Very', 'much', 'landscapes', 'Reflecting', 'Skin.For', 'got', 'intentions', 'film', 'Wind', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'pun', 'intended', 'time', 'when', 'most', 'films', 'are', 'just', 'made', 'rake', 'bucks', 'compete', 'be', 'mentioned', 'Entertainment', 'Tonight', 'top', 'film', 'draw', 'week', 'Years', 'later', 'great', 'little', 'films', 'one', 'mind', 'not', 'processed', 'blockbusters.Get', 'bad', 'marketing', 'ploy', 'video', 'distributor', 'just', 'might', 'find', 'engaging', 'story', 'indeed', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'friends', 'seek', 'out', 'unusual', 'films', 'one']",N/A

Schultz,"[2, 4]","A group of ""friends"" use the flimsiest of excuses to gang up on and punish one of their own.Something interesting could have developed from this premise. It could have given the writer/director scope to make a commentary on man's inherently violent nature. It could at least have riffed on the theme of one of Shirley Jackson's famous horror stories. In that typically subtle story, a woman is shocked to find that whenever she mentions her dog's minor misbehavior to one of her neighbors, that neighbor, with all too much relish, launches into some increasingly sadistic suggestions on how to correct the dog. ""You could tie it up and get this pepper spray, and then...""For just a moment, it looked as if this movie was going to head in that direction, expanding on the idea of what a thin veneer of decency most of us maintain. And under that - bloodlust. But too bad, ""The Wind"" doesn't explore that theme. It almost immediately reveals that what's underneath its veneer of presumption as a professional movie - is just a hopeless, meaningless mishmash.And in fact, the movie usually doesn't even maintain a veneer of professionalism. For example, when the characters stand in a meadow clearing, ringed by trees, the narrator remarks on how a strong wind is blowing, stirring everything. But what we see is the most perfectly static landscape you could image. Not a leaf is moving even a hair's breath anywhere. They should have waited until there was at least a breeze - a wafting - something, before they shot that scene.There is one shot that I think by sheer accident is striking. The friends are seen walking away in eerie synchronicity, like a silent pack on the prowl. But other than that shot, this movie is a pale, cold bowl of oatmeal. I don't say it's absolutely worthless. But I suggest you use it as a last resort, if it's the only movie you have, it's past midnight, and all the rental stores are closed.",2,Let This One Blow Over,1170892800,"02 8, 2007",2007,1921,"['group', 'friends', 'use', 'flimsiest', 'excuses', 'gang', 'up', 'punish', 'one', 'own.Something', 'interesting', 'could', 'have', 'developed', 'premise', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'writer/director', 'scope', 'make', 'commentary', 'man', 'inherently', 'violent', 'nature', 'could', 'least', 'have', 'riffed', 'theme', 'one', 'Shirley', 'Jackson', 'famous', 'horror', 'stories', 'typically', 'subtle', 'story', 'woman', 'shocked', 'find', 'whenever', 'dog', 'minor', 'misbehavior', 'one', 'neighbors', 'neighbor', 'too', 'much', 'relish', 'increasingly', 'sadistic', 'suggestions', 'how', 'correct', 'dog', 'could', 'tie', 'up', 'get', 'pepper', 'spray', 'then', 'just', 'moment', 'looked', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'head', 'direction', 'expanding', 'idea', 'what', 'thin', 'veneer', 'decency', 'most', 'maintain', 'bloodlust', 'too', 'bad', 'Wind', ""n't"", 'explore', 'theme', 'almost', 'immediately', 'what', 'underneath', 'veneer', 'presumption', 'professional', 'movie', 'just', 'hopeless', 'meaningless', 'mishmash.And', 'fact', 'movie', 'usually', ""n't"", 'even', 'maintain', 'veneer', 'professionalism', 'example', 'when', 'characters', 'stand', 'meadow', 'clearing', 'ringed', 'trees', 'narrator', 'remarks', 'how', 'strong', 'wind', 'blowing', 'stirring', 'everything', 'what', 'see', 'most', 'perfectly', 'static', 'landscape', 'could', 'image', 'Not', 'leaf', 'moving', 'even', 'hair', 'breath', 'anywhere', 'should', 'have', 'waited', 'was', 'least', 'breeze', 'wafting', 'something', 'shot', 'one', 'shot', 'think', 'sheer', 'accident', 'striking', 'friends', 'are', 'seen', 'walking', 'away', 'eerie', 'synchronicity', 'silent', 'pack', 'prowl', 'other', 'shot', 'movie', 'pale', 'cold', 'bowl', 'oatmeal', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'absolutely', 'worthless', 'suggest', 'use', 'last', 'resort', 'only', 'movie', 'have', 'past', 'midnight', 'rental', 'stores', 'are', 'closed']",N/A
