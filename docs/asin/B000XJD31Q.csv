This is a movie that deserves to be seen and heard in high-definition. The sumptuous '05 Chinese musical story-within-a-story is a feast for the eyes and ears and this release delivers on Blu-Ray's promise. The first thing I noticed was how sharp the music is in BD HD; every instrument in the orchestra can be heard with remarkable clarity. The power of Jacky Cheung's voice is more enhanced; the pain in Takeshi Kaneshiro's and the vulnerability in Zhou Xun's is more pronounced. Visually, the images all but leap off the screen. In Kaneshiro's opening scene the image is so detailed it's possible to count the whiskers on his face. The dance sequences, already thrilling in standard DVD, feel like they're taking place in your living room in HD. It's really nice to see that a movie doesn't have to be filled with superheroes, robots, car chases, and gunfights to be worth watching in Blu-Ray. If you love the musical format, ""Perhaps Love"" in Blu-Ray is a treat.",5,Perhaps Love delivers on HD promise,1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,1072,"['did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Perhaps', 'Love', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'beautiful', 'standard', 'DVD', 'format', 'was', 'wrong', 'movie', 'be', 'seen', 'heard', 'high-definition', 'sumptuous', 'Chinese', 'musical', 'story-within-a-story', 'feast', 'eyes', 'ears', 'release', 'Blu-Ray', 'promise', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'how', 'sharp', 'music', 'BD', 'HD', 'instrument', 'orchestra', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'remarkable', 'clarity', 'power', 'Jacky', 'Cheung', 'voice', 'more', 'enhanced', 'pain', 'Takeshi', 'Kaneshiro', 'vulnerability', 'Zhou', 'Xun', 'more', 'pronounced', 'Visually', 'images', 'leap', 'off', 'screen', 'Kaneshiro', 'opening', 'scene', 'image', 'so', 'detailed', 'possible', 'count', 'whiskers', 'face', 'dance', 'sequences', 'already', 'thrilling', 'standard', 'DVD', 'feel', ""'re"", 'taking', 'place', 'living', 'room', 'HD', 'really', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'filled', 'superheroes', 'robots', 'car', 'chases', 'gunfights', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'Blu-Ray', 'love', 'musical', 'format', 'Perhaps', 'Love', 'Blu-Ray', 'treat']",Perhaps Love

I could not find anyone to watch it w/ me, it's that slow.  Still, I am glad I have it, for a snowy day, when I can't get out...I will revisit this interesting place.  Also, Korean actor Ji Jin-Hee is like the 4th lead in this Chinese melodrama, so he brings his humanity to the plot...always a good thing.",3,a slow dream & Ji Jin-hee,1373932800,"07 16, 2013",2013,429,"['one', 'long', 'slow', 'dream', 'so', 'pretty', 'look', 'actors', 'are', 'wonderful', 'pacing', 'VERY', 'slow', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'anyone', 'watch', 'w/', 'slow', 'Still', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'snowy', 'day', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'out', 'will', 'revisit', 'interesting', 'place', 'Also', 'Korean', 'actor', 'Ji', 'Jin-Hee', '4th', 'lead', 'Chinese', 'melodrama', 'humanity', 'plot', 'always', 'good', 'thing']",Perhaps Love
1114404,A1EKUAG3Q75EDA,B000XJD31Q,Larry Billman,"[1, 1]","Having been a fan of the Movie Musical my entire life, when I heard about this film, I was skeptical. A movie musical made in China? Directed by a man (Peter Chan) who said that he hates musicals? I purchased this disc and fell in love. The Asian cast is all magnificent - and singing for themselves. The choreography by famed Bollywood choreographer Farah Khan is wonderful and her ""eye"" for capturing dance on film makes the musical numbers fascinating to watch. The brilliant ""opening number"" prepares us for the stunning visual journey we are about to take. Although the plot is melodramatic (with lots of references both visual and musical to ""Phantom of the Opera"")it was made for Chinese audiences and fans of Jacky Cheung, the excellent male lead. The many ""extras"" that are included are fascinating. Is the movie musical dead? (Think ""Rock of Ages"") Nope. It is alive and well and living in China. And also brilliantly captured in this excellent Blu-ray disc. Film musical fans: Do yourself a favor and check this one out.",4,A wonderful surprise,1349481600,"10 6, 2012",2012,1031,"['Having', 'been', 'fan', 'Movie', 'Musical', 'entire', 'life', 'when', 'heard', 'film', 'was', 'skeptical', 'movie', 'musical', 'made', 'China', 'Directed', 'man', 'Peter', 'Chan', 'who', 'said', 'musicals', 'purchased', 'disc', 'fell', 'love', 'Asian', 'cast', 'magnificent', 'singing', 'choreography', 'famed', 'Bollywood', 'choreographer', 'Farah', 'Khan', 'wonderful', 'eye', 'capturing', 'dance', 'film', 'musical', 'numbers', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'brilliant', 'opening', 'number', 'stunning', 'visual', 'journey', 'are', 'take', 'plot', 'melodramatic', 'lots', 'references', 'visual', 'musical', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'was', 'made', 'Chinese', 'audiences', 'fans', 'Jacky', 'Cheung', 'excellent', 'male', 'lead', 'many', 'extras', 'are', 'included', 'are', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'musical', 'dead', 'Think', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'Nope', 'alive', 'well', 'living', 'China', 'also', 'brilliantly', 'captured', 'excellent', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'Film', 'musical', 'fans', 'Do', 'favor', 'check', 'one', 'out']",Perhaps Love

1114406,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000XJD31Q,Trevor Willsmer,"[14, 15]","Peter Chan's Perhaps Love is an intriguing Chinese/Hong Kong/Malaysian backstage musical built around the notion of life as a movie where we constantly edit our memories and that, while we are all the leading players in our personal movie, we're no more than bit parts rather than co-stars in anybody else's and that consequently life is full of abandoned subplots and deleted footage. With the huge amount of mutual crossover between local pop stars and Hong Kong movies, it's surprising there have been so few movie musicals from that part of the world, but they're thin enough on the ground for this to be marketed as the first Chinese musical in 40 years. Only it's not 'really' a musical - like most modern musicals, it tries to disguise the fact it's a musical by setting its drama against the making of a movie musical as Takeshi Kaneshiro has to come to terms with the fact that the great love of his life (Zhao Xun, excellent in a virtual dual role) has completely edited him out of her memory because to her the past is only useful as a reminder of what to get away from. Her present is Jacky Cheung's director with Fellini syndrome (he can't see what he really wants to do with his film), and she's already rewriting that relationship in expectation of a Hollywood deal. Through it all wanders Ji Jin-hee's angelic keeper of discarded footage, an occasional observer rather than an active participant.Hong Kong's failed official entry for the Best Foreign Film Oscar, it's a lavishly mounted affair, with beautiful photography and great design. There are some visual influences from Jacques Demy (most notably an overhead shot of multi-coloured umbrellas) and more overtly in the circus scenes Moulin Rouge, although thankfully the musical numbers are much better shot than Luhrman's effort, and without resorting to excessive ADDS editing. Peter Kam's songs may occasionally sound a little odd to Western ears (although the HK DVD thankfully subtitles the lyrics, a rarity in musicals), but they're surprisingly impressive and memorable, and for the most part well-served by the cast. Kaneshiro may have the face of an angel but he also has the singing voice of Lee Marvin, although since his songs aren't written for a trained voice that's not a major problem. However, Jacky Cheung is quite a revelation to anyone only aware of his work as an actor - not only does he have the strongest voice among the cast, but its the one that puts the real emotional power into his numbers. Its appeal to Western audiences is probably limited to fans of Wong Kar-Wei's brand of morally compromised romanticism, although this is not as exhilarating or daring as the best of Wong, it has more than enough imagination and emotional resonance of its own to make it well worth checking out.",4,Life is a movie - with deleted scenes and added songs,1196035200,"11 26, 2007",2007,2786,"['Peter', 'Chan', 'Perhaps', 'Love', 'intriguing', 'Chinese/Hong', 'Kong/Malaysian', 'backstage', 'musical', 'built', 'notion', 'life', 'movie', 'where', 'constantly', 'edit', 'memories', 'are', 'leading', 'players', 'personal', 'movie', ""'re"", 'more', 'bit', 'parts', 'rather', 'co-stars', 'anybody', 'else', 'consequently', 'life', 'full', 'abandoned', 'subplots', 'deleted', 'footage', 'huge', 'amount', 'mutual', 'crossover', 'local', 'pop', 'stars', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'movies', 'surprising', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'few', 'movie', 'musicals', 'part', 'world', ""'re"", 'thin', 'enough', 'ground', 'be', 'marketed', 'first', 'Chinese', 'musical', '40', 'years', 'Only', 'not', ""'really"", 'musical', 'most', 'modern', 'musicals', 'disguise', 'fact', 'musical', 'setting', 'drama', 'making', 'movie', 'musical', 'Takeshi', 'Kaneshiro', 'come', 'terms', 'fact', 'great', 'love', 'life', 'Zhao', 'Xun', 'excellent', 'virtual', 'dual', 'role', 'completely', 'edited', 'memory', 'past', 'only', 'useful', 'reminder', 'what', 'get', 'away', 'present', 'Jacky', 'Cheung', 'director', 'Fellini', 'syndrome', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'really', 'do', 'film', 'already', 'rewriting', 'relationship', 'expectation', 'Hollywood', 'deal', 'wanders', 'Ji', 'Jin-hee', 'angelic', 'keeper', 'discarded', 'footage', 'occasional', 'observer', 'rather', 'active', 'participant.Hong', 'Kong', 'failed', 'official', 'entry', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'Oscar', 'lavishly', 'mounted', 'affair', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'great', 'design', 'are', 'visual', 'influences', 'Jacques', 'Demy', 'most', 'notably', 'overhead', 'shot', 'multi-coloured', 'umbrellas', 'more', 'overtly', 'circus', 'scenes', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'thankfully', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'shot', 'Luhrman', 'effort', 'resorting', 'excessive', 'ADDS', 'editing', 'Peter', 'Kam', 'songs', 'may', 'occasionally', 'sound', 'little', 'odd', 'Western', 'ears', 'HK', 'DVD', 'thankfully', 'lyrics', 'rarity', 'musicals', ""'re"", 'surprisingly', 'impressive', 'memorable', 'most', 'part', 'well-served', 'cast', 'Kaneshiro', 'may', 'have', 'face', 'angel', 'also', 'singing', 'voice', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'songs', 'are', ""n't"", 'written', 'trained', 'voice', 'not', 'major', 'problem', 'However', 'Jacky', 'Cheung', 'quite', 'revelation', 'anyone', 'only', 'aware', 'work', 'actor', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'strongest', 'voice', 'cast', 'one', 'real', 'emotional', 'power', 'numbers', 'appeal', 'Western', 'audiences', 'probably', 'limited', 'fans', 'Wong', 'Kar-Wei', 'brand', 'morally', 'compromised', 'romanticism', 'not', 'exhilarating', 'daring', 'best', 'Wong', 'more', 'enough', 'imagination', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'own', 'make', 'well', 'checking', 'out']",Perhaps Love
