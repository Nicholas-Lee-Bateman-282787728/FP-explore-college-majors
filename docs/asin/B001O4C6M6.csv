Why it only went for 2 seasons is unfathomable, when there is SO much bad TV that keeps going on & on & on!!To me it was like reading a really good crime novel - ' Just one more chapter & I'll go to bed ' - I watched the whole of Season 2 in one day and was not for one second bored.Things change so rapidly that one has to concentrate, past paced, great acting, good plot & boy, can the Canadians make good TV!!I would recommend this series to anyone who liked 'Da Vinci's Inquest', 'the Wire' and 'Homicide - Life on the Streets'.All quality shows that we do not seem to have at our fingertips now.",5,Totally engrossing - fast paced.,1305763200,"05 19, 2011",2011,1052,"['Having', 'purchased', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'not', 'let', 'down', 'Season', '2', 'very', 'good', 'series.Ian', 'Tracey', 'Klea', 'Scott', 'Camille', 'Sullivan', 'John', 'Cassini', 'Matt', 'Frewer', 'give', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'good', 'guys', 'vs', 'bad', 'guys', 'scenario', 'lot', 'blurring', 'lines', 'good', 'bad', 'different', 'Canadian', 'US', 'spy', 'agency', 'acronyms', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'confusing', 'having', 'said', 'best', 'television', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'Why', 'only', 'went', '2', 'seasons', 'unfathomable', 'when', 'SO', 'much', 'bad', 'TV', 'going', 'was', 'reading', 'really', 'good', 'crime', 'novel', 'Just', 'one', 'more', 'chapter', ""'ll"", 'go', 'bed', 'watched', 'whole', 'Season', '2', 'one', 'day', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'second', 'bored.Things', 'change', 'so', 'rapidly', 'one', 'concentrate', 'past', 'paced', 'great', 'acting', 'good', 'plot', 'boy', 'can', 'Canadians', 'make', 'good', 'TV', 'would', 'recommend', 'series', 'anyone', 'who', 'liked', ""'Da"", 'Vinci', 'Inquest', 'Wire', ""'Homicide"", 'Life', ""Streets'.All"", 'quality', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'fingertips', 'now']","INTELLIGENCE, SEASON TWO"

Jimmy Reardon's hothead brother disappears w/out explanation. The tribulations of a Russian call-girl with a terrible accent (hopefully not real) take center-stage, but she is not a good enough actress to handle it.

He has a chance for a Michael Corleone moment w/ the rival American gang, but instead he keeps asking for peace as members of his Canadian crime alliance keep getting shot. The sub-plot btwn he & his psycho coke-fiend, ex-wife, and young hottie girlfriend never gets a chance to develop.

I rec'd season 2 3 days ago and I have one episode left.  My plan was to stretch it out as long as possible since it is the final season and the first night had to force my self to stop after one disc.  The second night I was not so lucky - I stayed up all night watching the next 6 hours.  One episode before bed - that was the plan...watched until 5 a.m.  Now I'm on the last disc and so sad.  My family has been bugging me since I gave them season 1 - where's season 2?  Kept forgetting it hadn't been released yet...no matter how many times I told them.I know they will be equally heartbroken when they finish it.  I would love to see these actors all in another crime show soon - but something lasting more than 2 seasons.  When you see a great show like this only last 2 seasons you've got to wonder what were they thinking?  There's no way it was replaced by anything better - no possible way.

Ian Tracey is so talented.  I completely believed him as Mic Leary and never thought I could turn around a believe him as Jimmy Reardon when he played such a great cop.  But Jimmy Reardon is just as believable, perfectly played and the rest of the cast is equally fabulous.
