Think of a really bad attempt of the following cultural elements: Bowling Alleys, Westside Story, Woodstock, hippies, gangs, various car oriented movies, or more recently, Glee, etc. Song and dance numbers were sparse and thankfully so. An alternative comparison would be the cheap fast food offerings called Bollywood - this film was even worse.",1,Kiosk &lt;1,1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,478,"['was', 'hard', 'tell', 'was', 'purposefully', 'suppose', 'be', 'spoof', 'American', ""'60s/70s"", 'culture', 'music', 'film', 'just', 'really', 'bad', 'Think', 'really', 'bad', 'attempt', 'following', 'cultural', 'elements', 'Bowling', 'Alleys', 'Westside', 'Story', 'Woodstock', 'hippies', 'gangs', 'various', 'car', 'oriented', 'movies', 'more', 'recently', 'Glee', 'etc', 'Song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'were', 'sparse', 'thankfully', 'so', 'alternative', 'comparison', 'would', 'be', 'cheap', 'fast', 'food', 'offerings', 'called', 'Bollywood', 'film', 'was', 'even', 'worse']",N/A

The story was OK (neither good nor bad). The reason for the rating is due to the way the movie leaves you feeling at the end of the film. I am glad I was able to see this movie and it was a worthy effort, but in the end I felt disappointed, but not enough to give it a bad rating.",3,It could have been better,1395792000,"03 26, 2014",2014,403,"['likeable', 'musical', 'film', 'Jay', 'Chou', 'were', 'many', 'things', 'like', 'film', 'music', 'choreography', 'story', 'was', 'OK', 'neither', 'good', 'bad', 'reason', 'rating', 'due', 'way', 'movie', 'feeling', 'end', 'film', 'am', 'glad', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'worthy', 'effort', 'end', 'felt', 'disappointed', 'not', 'enough', 'give', 'bad', 'rating']",N/A

I was too, but it was definitely fun and a lot of very attractive men and women in it and music and dancing and well it was fun. I am a big fan of the Chinese,  Japanese, Korean etc movies this musical comedy was quite a departure and I did really enjoy it.
