398453,A1Y09QLADQYQJG,6304053614,&#34;T=H=E --- 'Older Than Dirt' --- Time Tra...,"[1, 1]","I'm thinking this movie is sorta like The Marx Brothers... The Three Stooges... Abbott & Costello... Dramadies... Woody Allen MoviesYou will either LOVE this... or hate it. I suppose I cannot understand why ANYONE would HATE most of the above named things...two, maybe...Well, anyway... This film, based on a short story, and even a short film, is no Sci-Fi special effects blockbuster. It is an excellentlittle film that WILL entertain you IF you enjoy a ""What if...love story.""It has been available on VHS-cassette; LASER-video-disc; and Digital-Video-Disc since, at least 1998.Since it's going on, like, fifteen years old, I'm certain there's PLENTY of people that have never HEARD, much less SEEN, this filmthat is similar to the film GROUNDHOG DAY, but dwells more on a lonely guy's crush on someone that gets ""crushed""... if he cannotdo something to prevent her certain death.Here, the entire day isn't repeated. Our hero doesn't kill himself JUST to get the damned day over. Here, a man has less than an hourto convince the woman he loves that not only is he NOT nuts, but she'll DIE if she doesn't LISTEN and believe him. Hmmm!If you put yourself in HIS shoes... If you see what HE sees about her (Helen Slater [Supergirl; City Slickers; Ruthless People])...If you want a movie that has more of a BOUNCE than a BOOM, you'll enjoy this.It's the STORY... not the explosions.It's the characters... not the blood.Besides Helen Slater, the film stars:Jonathon Silverman (BRIGHTON BEACH MEMOIRS; WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S).Nicolas SurovyJeremy Pivenand Academy Award winnerMartin Landau.Another movie that entertains with a time travel element without hitting you with a board is this one that stars Louis Gosset, Jr.,as a emaciated, fortyish cancer-stricken man and his fifteen year-old son who are given... ready for this?Time travelling shoes!Like I said, it's the S-T-O-R-Y that matters most!Gathering of Old Men with Bonus Film: In His Father's Shoes",5,This is the SIXTIETH review of 12:01...12:01...12:01...12:01...12:01...,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,1951,"[""'m"", 'thinking', 'movie', 'sorta', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'Dramadies', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'MoviesYou', 'will', 'either', 'LOVE', 'hate', 'suppose', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'ANYONE', 'would', 'HATE', 'most', 'above', 'named', 'things', 'two', 'maybe', 'Well', 'anyway', 'film', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'even', 'short', 'film', 'Sci-Fi', 'special', 'effects', 'blockbuster', 'excellentlittle', 'film', 'WILL', 'entertain', 'IF', 'enjoy', 'What', 'love', 'story', 'been', 'available', 'VHS-cassette', 'LASER-video-disc', 'Digital-Video-Disc', 'least', '1998.Since', 'going', 'fifteen', 'years', 'old', ""'m"", 'certain', 'PLENTY', 'people', 'have', 'never', 'HEARD', 'much', 'less', 'SEEN', 'filmthat', 'similar', 'film', 'GROUNDHOG', 'DAY', 'more', 'lonely', 'guy', 'crush', 'someone', 'crushed', 'something', 'prevent', 'certain', 'death.Here', 'entire', 'day', ""n't"", 'repeated', 'hero', ""n't"", 'kill', 'JUST', 'get', 'damned', 'day', 'Here', 'man', 'less', 'hourto', 'convince', 'woman', 'not', 'only', 'NOT', 'nuts', ""'ll"", 'DIE', ""n't"", 'LISTEN', 'believe', 'Hmmm', 'put', 'HIS', 'shoes', 'see', 'what', 'HE', 'Helen', 'Slater', '[', 'Supergirl', 'City', 'Slickers', 'Ruthless', 'People', ']', 'want', 'movie', 'more', 'BOUNCE', 'BOOM', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'this.It', 'STORY', 'not', 'explosions.It', 'characters', 'not', 'blood.Besides', 'Helen', 'Slater', 'film', 'stars', 'Jonathon', 'Silverman', 'BRIGHTON', 'BEACH', 'MEMOIRS', 'WEEKEND', 'AT', 'BERNIE', '.Nicolas', 'SurovyJeremy', 'Pivenand', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Landau.Another', 'movie', 'time', 'travel', 'element', 'hitting', 'board', 'one', 'Louis', 'Gosset', 'Jr.', 'emaciated', 'fortyish', 'cancer-stricken', 'man', 'fifteen', 'year-old', 'son', 'who', 'are', 'given', 'ready', 'Time', 'travelling', 'shoes', 'said', 'S-T-O-R-Y', 'most', 'Gathering', 'Old', 'Men', 'Bonus', 'Film', 'Father', 'Shoes']",12:01 VHS

398455,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,6304053614,Brent Butler,"[2, 2]","12:01 will remind you in many ways of Groundhog Day, as the hero of the movie is living the same day over and over again. However, this movie was made years earlier, and the scope and tone of the movie are completely different. Where Groundhog Day provided Bill Murray's character with a unique chance at self-discovery and redemption, here our hero is trying to save the woman he's developed a crush on from being murdered, and find out why his day keeps repeating over and over again.Jonathan Silverman is charming and funny in the role of a less than serious employee in a scientific firm's personnel department, who by chance is the only person who understands that the same day is repeating over and over again.Jeremy Piven is seen before his increase in fame, and is also amusing as Silverman's practical joking friend.Helen Slater is convincing as the beautiful and brainy scientist who Silverman must convince of both the existence of the ""time bounce"", and his feeling for her.Martin Landau gives his usual strong performance as the head of the research which ultimately creates the time bounce.As does Murray in Groundhog Day, Silverman tries various combinations of actions to make his day ""go right"", keeping notes as he does so. I think writers for both movies were inspired by video games: ""Hey, what if you could hit the reset button and live a day over and over again!""I was so impressed with 12:01 when it originally aired that I carefully checked the TV listings each week hoping it would rerun. When it did I taped it. I was delighted a few years later to find it available on DVD and get a superior viewing format to my aging VHS tape.At the time it aired it was a unique and very interesting story concept. The cast is great, and all give great performances.

398456,A1GHUN5HXMHZ89,6304053614,"C. A. Luster ""The Rook""","[0, 0]","I have been a fan of Science Fiction for decades, especially movies dealing with time travel, and yet somehow this one slipped by me. This movie may not be steeped in SciFi, but I can name you many other movies that were excellent that used a SciFi premise and did not have many special effects or scientific jargon to bolster the story. Now when I caught a few minutes of this on TV when I hit the sack late last night I truly could tell from a few minutes of it that it was something I really wanted to see and if I wasn't so tired I would have seen all the last half. Jonathan Silverman I have always enjoyed in what few movies I have seen him in to date.Everyone of course has seen ""Weekend at Bernie's"" since it is a riot. Silverman's role here is a bit more mature, but nonetheless he pulls off some great comedy just because his timing and delivery are flawless. Even though I have only seen a few minutes of this I am ordering it today. For this price there is no way I am passing up what I am sure is a great movie for such a low price. Once I see the whole thing I will add to this review. After seeing the whole movie, in a nutshell I saw that he was in a timeloop where a pretty girl he likes is shot dead. Each day he tries to figure out a way to stop it from happening without being carted off in a straight-jacket. If you enjoyed this, catch ""Timerider"". Another romantic comedy time travel movie with a good cast that didn't get recognition it deserved. Good quality DVD with no extras. Decent replayability. - C.

398457,A1GBVCADZBO8YG,6304053614,Emc2,"[2, 12]","This is a TV movie that caught my attention because the Amazon summary describe it as science fiction, and most reviewers rated it as a good movie. Because I did not have it on my radar, I did search a bit and found out the film is based in the 1973 short story ""12:01 PM"" by Richard A. Lupoff, published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. Considering the plot is about time repeating, just like the famousGroundhog Day (Special Edition), I decided to give a try and bought it for my Sci-Fi collection.What a disappointment! The film is supposed to be science fiction because the time repeating effect is vaguely explained as a result of a quantum mechanics side effect of a secret project, but surprise, the science ends there. This film is actually a comedy, and not a very good one. The acting is mediocre and the script is dull.At least Groundhog Day had a philosophical message about what we do with our lives, 12:01 has none. And given that any time repeating plot get tedious at some point, the film's message and Bill Murray performance allow you to endure until the end of the film. Never mind Groundhog Day never explains why time is bouncing.Absolutely not recommended for science fiction fans, this is a film just for those who really like a light comedy and need to kill some time during the weekend.",1,"Just a time repeating film, no philosophy nor sci-fi, just a regular comedy",1221523200,"09 16, 2008",2008,1326,"['TV', 'movie', 'caught', 'attention', 'Amazon', 'summary', 'describe', 'science', 'fiction', 'most', 'reviewers', 'rated', 'good', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'radar', 'did', 'search', 'bit', 'found', 'film', 'based', '1973', 'short', 'story', '12:01', 'PM', 'Richard', 'A.', 'Lupoff', 'published', 'Magazine', 'Fantasy', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'Considering', 'plot', 'time', 'repeating', 'just', 'famousGroundhog', 'Day', 'Special', 'Edition', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'bought', 'Sci-Fi', 'collection.What', 'disappointment', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'science', 'fiction', 'time', 'repeating', 'effect', 'vaguely', 'explained', 'result', 'quantum', 'mechanics', 'side', 'effect', 'secret', 'project', 'surprise', 'science', 'there', 'film', 'actually', 'comedy', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'acting', 'mediocre', 'script', 'dull.At', 'least', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'had', 'philosophical', 'message', 'what', 'do', 'lives', '12:01', 'none', 'given', 'time', 'repeating', 'plot', 'get', 'tedious', 'point', 'film', 'message', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'performance', 'allow', 'endure', 'end', 'film', 'Never', 'mind', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'never', 'why', 'time', 'bouncing.Absolutely', 'not', 'recommended', 'science', 'fiction', 'fans', 'film', 'just', 'who', 'really', 'light', 'comedy', 'need', 'kill', 'time', 'weekend']",12:01 VHS

So if anyone knows what the Hollywood release was called please tell, as Lupoff doesn't state in his book what they named it.To read the short story you'll have to buy the book by Richard Lupoff called Before...12:01...and after. There are 23 short stories in the book 12:01pm being one of them.Anyway, I think this movie is great, some may say its cheesy but hey I like cheese sometimes. I like Helen Slater and Jonathan Silverman I think they work well together in this movie.

As others have noted, the always beautiful Helen (Supergirl) Slater positively glows in this film. In the lead role, Jonathan Silverman excels as the discouraged office worker who witnesses his only real love being murdered in broad daylight, then being given the chance to undo it, while being thwarted at every turn.As a fan of all time-warp stories, I count this as my favorite.

Yes, it's very similar to Groundhog Day and also Ken Grimwood's novel Replay, yet 12:01 has its own identity. This film is sharp, funny, and romantic. It also throws a bone to the sci-fi fanatics. And, unlike Groundhog Day, 12:01 doesn't get mired in the muck of existentialism. I've only seen this once - I guess, 13 years ago - when it originally aired on television in 1993. But, it's stayed in my brain. I was very disappointed when I checked on this site months ago and realized that this dvd hasn't been put out yet. Well, the excellent news is that now, there is a release date: November 28, 2006. Believe me, I pre-ordered this sucker pronto.Barry Thomas (Jonathan Silverman) is an office drone languishing in his stuck-in-a-rut job while crushing on this beautiful, brainy research scientist Lisa, who is seemingly way out of his league.  A typical humdrum day at work ensues and ends; then, shockingly, Barry witnesses Lisa brutally get shot down to death. Overwrought, he goes to a bar and drinks. Later that night, a storm causes a lamp to shock Barry, exactly at 12:01AM. He wakes up the next morning to find that he's been caught in a time loop, where the same day keeps repeating. Now, armed with certain knowledge of predetermined events, Barry attempts to prevent Lisa's death and escape the time trap.Jonathan Silverman stood out in my mind as being particularly charming in a lovable loser role. He carried this film. Throughout 12:01, I cheered for him to get things right, save the girl and win her heart. Helen Slater was very sweet here, her performance nicely meshing with Silverman's to create a nice, easy chemistry. We also got to see co-stars Jeremy Piven and Martin Landau.This was a fast-paced, unassuming but vastly entertaining, little film which contained, at the heart of it all, a sweet romantic storyline, while also serving as a competent thriller.

The sense of d&eacute;j&agrave;-vu one gets from watching it however, is not necessarily from the same day repeating plot device but instead from the invariable comparisons to Groundhog Day.In my always humble opinion Groundhog Day is one of the best films of the nineties. It told an eternal truth which is that many of us simply repeat the same day over and over again without living any particular day to the max. 12:01 doesn't have that ability and as a result much of the film it simply goes through the motions.12:01 stars Helen Slater and Jonathan Silverman. Both actors never quite reached the promise of their early careers but both are certainly competent here. Slater just doesn't quite have the charisma of say a Helen Hunt and Silverman just never quite reaches the comedy of say a Jerry Seinfeld. Nevertheless they are both quite likable in their respective roles.The story is a more serious sci-fi affair complete with giant science machines and bad guys that wouldn't be out of place in a TJ Hooker episode.

Silverman's actions in the first half of the movie are out and out stupid, and no wonder everyone thinks he's nuts.  However, as he learns a better way to prove his wild story, he becomes more convincing.  The movie doesn't rely on special effects, and it's interesting to see how he manages to alter things and in doing so, we learn everything's not the way it seems.
