749936,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00008YGRW,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[3, 3]","Nominated for 4 Emmys and 4 Golden Globes, including Best Television Series - Drama, The Shield is one of the top police dramas of the past decade. The brainchild of creator Shawn Ryan, writer for such hit shows as Nash Bridges (1996) and Angel (1999), The Shield made history in 2003 by becoming the first basic cable series to win a Golden Globe for Best Drama Series (in the past, only non-ad supported shows such as The Sopranos and Sex And The City have done so well). The hour-long drama boasts a strong, well-rounded cast who, along with the writers/producers, have managed to make The Shield the longest running series on the FX Network...The Shield centers around an inner-city Los Angeles police precinct where the lines between right and wrong are often blurred. An ongoing power struggle between a group of corrupt, yet effective, cops and their new boss, Capt. David Aceveda (Benito Martinez), remains the focal point of the show. Det. Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis, of The Commish) heads up an elite unit known as the Strike Team. An effective leader who bends the rules when they fit his aims, Mackey often butts heads with the by-the-book Aceveda who weighs his own political ambitions against the cost of bringing down Mackey and his associates. Veteran Det. Claudette Wyms (CCH Pounder, of ER) knows the ropes, admires Mackey, but also knows how to play sides of the game. For the 2005 season, Glenn Close - star of such films as The Natural (1984), Fatal Attraction (1987), and Air Force One (1997) - joined the cast as Capt. Monica Rawling. Together, this celebrated cast maintains an internal tension among themselves while carrying out a unified fight against the criminal element - a fight that keeps the streets of L.A. safe...The Shield (Season 2) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""The Quick Fix"" in which Vic searches feverishly for the whereabouts of his wife and children. In his absence, the Strike Team allows a shipment of cocaine into Farmington that turns out to be bad, prompting the team to enter Tijuana in search of the culprits. Meanwhile, Detectives Wyms and Wagenbach attempt to solve a series of gangland assaults... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Homewrecker"" in which Mackey, Wyms, and Wagenbach investigate several murders at a women's shelter, and ""Breakpoint"" in which Mackey secretly works with Dutch and Claudette to uncover the whereabouts of a missing kid...Below is a list of episodes included on The Shield (Season 2) DVD:Episode 14 (The Quick Fix)Episode 15 (Dead Soldiers)Episode 16 (Partners)Episode 17 (Carte Blanche)Episode 18 (Greenlit)Episode 19 (Homewrecker)Episode 20 (Barnstormers)Episode 21 (Scar Tissue)Episode 22 (Co-Pilot)Episode 23 (Coyotes)Episode 24 (Inferno)Episode 25 (Breakpoint)Episode 26 (Dominoes Falling)The DVD Report",5,A fascinating series...,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,2847,"['Nominated', '4', 'Emmys', '4', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'including', 'Best', 'Television', 'Series', 'Drama', 'Shield', 'one', 'top', 'police', 'dramas', 'past', 'decade', 'brainchild', 'creator', 'Shawn', 'Ryan', 'writer', 'such', 'hit', 'shows', 'Nash', 'Bridges', '1996', 'Angel', '1999', 'Shield', 'made', 'history', '2003', 'becoming', 'first', 'basic', 'cable', 'series', 'win', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Best', 'Drama', 'Series', 'past', 'only', 'non-ad', 'supported', 'shows', 'such', 'Sopranos', 'Sex', 'City', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'hour-long', 'drama', 'strong', 'well-rounded', 'cast', 'who', 'writers/producers', 'have', 'managed', 'make', 'Shield', 'longest', 'running', 'series', 'FX', 'Network', 'Shield', 'centers', 'inner-city', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'police', 'precinct', 'where', 'lines', 'right', 'wrong', 'are', 'often', 'blurred', 'ongoing', 'power', 'struggle', 'group', 'corrupt', 'yet', 'effective', 'cops', 'new', 'boss', 'Capt', 'David', 'Aceveda', 'Benito', 'Martinez', 'focal', 'point', 'show', 'Det', 'Vic', 'Mackey', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'Commish', 'up', 'elite', 'unit', 'known', 'Strike', 'Team', 'effective', 'leader', 'who', 'rules', 'when', 'fit', 'aims', 'Mackey', 'often', 'heads', 'by-the-book', 'Aceveda', 'who', 'own', 'political', 'ambitions', 'cost', 'bringing', 'down', 'Mackey', 'associates', 'Veteran', 'Det', 'Claudette', 'Wyms', 'CCH', 'Pounder', 'ER', 'ropes', 'admires', 'Mackey', 'also', 'how', 'play', 'sides', 'game', '2005', 'season', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'star', 'such', 'films', 'Natural', '1984', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', '1987', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', '1997', 'joined', 'cast', 'Capt', 'Monica', 'Rawling', 'Together', 'celebrated', 'cast', 'internal', 'tension', 'carrying', 'out', 'unified', 'fight', 'criminal', 'element', 'fight', 'streets', 'L.A', 'safe', 'Shield', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'number', 'exciting', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Quick', 'Fix', 'Vic', 'feverishly', 'whereabouts', 'wife', 'children', 'absence', 'Strike', 'Team', 'shipment', 'cocaine', 'Farmington', 'out', 'be', 'bad', 'prompting', 'team', 'enter', 'Tijuana', 'search', 'culprits', 'Meanwhile', 'Detectives', 'Wyms', 'Wagenbach', 'attempt', 'solve', 'series', 'gangland', 'assaults', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'include', 'Homewrecker', 'Mackey', 'Wyms', 'Wagenbach', 'investigate', 'several', 'murders', 'women', 'shelter', 'Breakpoint', 'Mackey', 'secretly', 'Dutch', 'Claudette', 'uncover', 'whereabouts', 'missing', 'kid', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Shield', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'Episode', '14', 'Quick', 'Fix', 'Episode', '15', 'Dead', 'Soldiers', 'Episode', '16', 'Partners', 'Episode', '17', 'Carte', 'Blanche', 'Episode', '18', 'Greenlit', 'Episode', '19', 'Homewrecker', 'Episode', '20', 'Barnstormers', 'Episode', '21', 'Scar', 'Tissue', 'Episode', '22', 'Co-Pilot', 'Episode', '23', 'Coyotes', 'Episode', '24', 'Inferno', 'Episode', '25', 'Breakpoint', 'Episode', '26', 'Dominoes', 'Falling', 'DVD', 'Report']",Shield (Fox): The Complete 2nd Season (Cancelled)

749940,A3RTMB76CJWY9U,B00008YGRW,DonAthos,"[3, 3]","The Shield is a series of the highest-order. I could use this review to compare Season 2 to Season 1 (or those that come later), but whatever their individual strengths or weaknesses, they are all great. The acting in the Shield, especially Chiklis, is phenomenal, and the plotlines are all hard-hitting.I especially appreciate how nearly every main cast member gets their own plot arc which runs throughout the season, all tying up in the thrilling finale.Specifically, this season deals with the crafty gang leader Armadillo who puts a hit out on Mackey and his strike team; Vic trying to keep his family from spiralling further apart; Dutch's dealing with his shortcomings as a detective; Julian's struggle against his homosexual nature; Captain Aceveda's compromising with Mackey's questionable methods in his pursuit of political success; Danny's being targeted by a civilian with a grudge; and, finally, the strike team's plot to rob the Armenian mob.If you read the above list, which is not comprehensive, you'll realize that this season does a lot (especially given that it only runs 13 episodes long). Most television shows take much more time to achieve much less. This show does all of that with power, reality, emotion and offers three or four compelling crime-drama plotlines for all of its individual episodes, besides. Also, I should specifically mention that there is a ""prequel"" episode included, which takes place before the pilot episode. Pure brilliance.The Shield is one of the best shows television has to offer. Its Second Season, however it might relate to the others, is a quality part of the series.

Detective Claudette Wymms (the exceptional C.C.H. Pounder) suspects this unholy alliance and begins to investigate Vic while trying to bolster her partner, Dutch's confidence after he screws up a case.

Very helpful and much appreciated.  Of all of the episodes I felt CO-PILOT was the weakest.  Though interesting it was a throw away.  I liked seeing the origin of the Strike Team, but I did not feel it rang true to the very first episode.  It implied that the malfeasance of the team only began a few days before the first episode, though the first episode implied their antics had been going on for quite some time.Season two is more violent than season one and the Strike Team makes quite a few new enemies.

I was hooked by the First Season DVD and almost felt post partum depression when it's episode 13 finished and I realized I didn't have the Second Season on hand to keep following the adventures of Vic Mackey and all of the others at The Barn in Farmington. That was quickly remedied with a one-click on Amazon and two days later I had the second season in hand. During this season you are brought up on the quest to hijack The Money Train by the Strike Team, Capt. Acevada's quest for a City Council seat, thefurther marital problems of Vic Mackey,the Civilian Auditor's report and the fallout from that and many, many sub plots that continue to swirl through this amazing series. There is no disappointment in the Second Season. Once again, I found myself watching the 13th episode and wondering where the time had gone and then scurring to the computer right after it finished to order the Third Season. The series is probably not for everyone. There is considerable violence, much bad language, and some conversations about sex and sexual orientation that are not for young ears, It is adult fare and it comes at you like a runaway freight train.

Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[1, 2]","Series creator Shawn Ryan led &quot;The Shield&quot; through its second season while sacrificing or toning down NONE of the grittiness and fierce energy that made Season One so spectacular.Vic and his Strike Team, like in the first season, spend 13 tense episodes walking that fine line between morality and immorality.  In season two they are targeted for execution by a ruthless drug lord (played very menacingly by Danny Pino), compelled to frame a fellow cop for contributing to a murder, and tap dance to keep the Police Administration, their boss, their boss' corrupt boss, civilian auditors, fellow detectives, and fate from finally exposing them for what they have become and having the whole thing blow up in their faces.Vic has more on the line this season, both professionally and personally.  While the final episode of Season Two isn't the violence-filled tension-fest that ended Season One, it does lay the groundwork for a particularly tense Season Three.  On top of everything else the Strike Team has had to deal with up to now, in spite of all the bullets they've somehow dodged, Season Three is slated to see them being hunted by the Armenian Mob AND on in the crosshairs of their new boss, Detective Wymms, who is morally determined to take down Vic and his men.  Detective Aceveda may have been driven by a mix of morality and political ambition, but the political ambition part was what provided a safety net for Vic.  Wymms has no such ambitions.  So Vic and crew are up against a couple of more determined enemies than they've ever faced before.I bought the Season Two DVD box set the day it was released (01/06/04) and had watched the entire 13 episode season within 24 hours.

749959,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B00008YGRW,Mitch Weaver,"[1, 4]","Fans of the first season know what an amazing show The Shield is. However, that is the reason that I had doubts about season 2. I mean, with how great season 1 was, it would be kind of hard to top. Season 2 of &quot;The Shield&quot; manages to be even better than the first season. Every moment from the opening episode, to the extremely enjoyable season finale is filled with even more violence, profanity, and controversy. The suspense this season brings is unreal. You see everything from Mackey and his team being heavily investigated to Aciveda aligning himself with Mackey. Season 2 should definately not be missed.&quot;The Shield&quot; in my opinion is one of the best shown on TV right now. The FX Network raised the quality of their programming up a notch when they released The Shield onto the air. The thing that I like most about the show, is how realistic it is. It actually feels like you are witnessing what goes on in the real world. The show often showcases acts of violence, nudity, and tons of profanity. That is why the show works. The quality of the show is put above the actual opinion of the viewers. The Shield is also the first cop show that I have seen that actually ties the episodes together. A lot of cop shows are based on what happens from case to case. But with The Shield, you actually have to see every episode to understand what's going on. Michael Chiklis offers one of the best performances I have ever seen with his portrayal of Vic Mackey. The character often toys with your emotions because you will find yourself hating the guy and supporting the guy all at the same time. The rest of the cast is top notch as well, despite being filled with relatively unknown actors.The Shield is the one show that you should definately watch. The disturbing cases, excellent acting, and overall realistic feel push the show to a whole new level of law enforcement television. Watching season 2 of The Shield on DVD is the only way to go.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[4, 5]","Despite what many critics stated about the second season of FX's The Shield, this season proves to be better than the first by pushing (and even breaking) the limits of what can be seen on television.  The main story running throughout this season is corrupt cop Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) and his Strike team learn of a money train and plan to hit it, but not without a few snags in the way.  Julian (Michael Jace) denies his homosexuality and gets a quick marriage before he is revealed to his fellow officers, Dani (Catherine Dent) loses more and more her grip on her job and her state of mind, while Shane (Walt Goggins) forms a closer bond to Vic.  Season highlights include Carl Weathers guest starring as Vic's old partner, the introduction of a drug dealer named Armadillo that would have a profound impact on the show, and a flashback type episode in which we see Vic and the Strike team join together for the first time, and we witness Vic's first corrupt act as a cop.  Even though Chiklis gets most of the press for his performance on the show, the standout of season 2 was undoubtadly CCH Pounder who slowly learns the truth about Vic and his team, the culmination of which finds her in line for Aceveda's (Benito Martinez) job; the culmination of which will come to a head in the upcoming third season of the show.  I had feared that after a breakout first season The Shield would become a cliche, corrupt cop drama a la NYPD Blue, but creator Shawn Ryan pulls no punches and up's the ante for on screen violence and brutality, while weaving an incredible web of story.

The first year of The Shield completely blew my doors off.  Non stop action, great plotting, dialogue and the acting was top notch.  Other than the birth of my sons, those thirteen hours were the best I spent that year.  It had to go downhill though, right?  The second season would be the one where Ryan and company would resort to the tired conventions of police drama and my new favorite show would lose it's edge.  Happily- Wrong again.Season two developed the characters of Mackey and his crew to new levels.  If you haven't seen the show I won't ruin anything for you, but everyone is put through the wringer in these thirteen episodes.  We get political intrigue, interoffice machinations, great police drama with healthy doses of sex and violence.  Unfortunately that's what most people focus on.Chicklis deserved the Emmy for the quiet moments as well as the brutal ones.  This actor has got a slow burn like no other.  There are moments where he says nothing but we can tell all the alternatives he is running through his head by simply looking at his eyes and physicality.  This season brings Mackey to a crossroads where he has to make some serious decisions about where his life is headed and we feel every emotion he is going through thanks to this beautiful, bald man.That having been said, this is not a series for the faint of heart.  There are scenes of physical torture, violence against women, hostage situations and raw sex. You are forewarned.If your stomach can take a brutal, skillfully written, brilliantly acted police drama there is no better way to take up space in your DVD player than The Shield.",5,I had my doubts...,1065139200,"10 3, 2003",2003,1763,"['be', 'honest', 'never', 'thought', 'Shield', 'could', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'set', 'premier', 'episode', 'was', 'so', 'incredibly', 'wrong', 'first', 'year', 'Shield', 'completely', 'blew', 'doors', 'off', 'Non', 'stop', 'action', 'great', 'plotting', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'Other', 'birth', 'sons', 'thirteen', 'hours', 'were', 'best', 'spent', 'year', 'had', 'go', 'downhill', 'right', 'second', 'season', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'where', 'Ryan', 'company', 'would', 'resort', 'tired', 'conventions', 'police', 'drama', 'new', 'favorite', 'show', 'would', 'lose', 'edge', 'Happily-', 'Wrong', 'again.Season', 'two', 'developed', 'characters', 'Mackey', 'crew', 'new', 'levels', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'anything', 'everyone', 'put', 'wringer', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'get', 'political', 'intrigue', 'interoffice', 'machinations', 'great', 'police', 'drama', 'healthy', 'doses', 'sex', 'violence', 'Unfortunately', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'focus', 'on.Chicklis', 'deserved', 'Emmy', 'quiet', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'brutal', 'ones', 'actor', 'got', 'slow', 'burn', 'other', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'nothing', 'can', 'tell', 'alternatives', 'running', 'head', 'simply', 'looking', 'eyes', 'physicality', 'season', 'Mackey', 'crossroads', 'where', 'make', 'serious', 'decisions', 'where', 'life', 'headed', 'feel', 'emotion', 'going', 'thanks', 'beautiful', 'bald', 'man.That', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'not', 'series', 'faint', 'heart', 'are', 'scenes', 'physical', 'torture', 'violence', 'women', 'hostage', 'situations', 'raw', 'sex', 'are', 'forewarned.If', 'stomach', 'can', 'take', 'brutal', 'skillfully', 'written', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'police', 'drama', 'better', 'way', 'take', 'up', 'space', 'DVD', 'player', 'Shield']",Shield (Fox): The Complete 2nd Season (Cancelled)
749966,A3H4EV4UMST3HV,B00008YGRW,steve b,"[5, 6]","Make no mistake The Shield is first class and along with The Wire, it is the most gritty police series on TV. Set in Los Angeles, with one exception all of the police officers are various shades of grey, balancing police work with their own ambitions. In particular this is true of the main charactor, Vic Mackey. Mackey is a good if ruthless cop, brave, loyal to his men and a loving father. He is also totaly corrupt licensing the drug dealers in his area and torturing and killing anyone who gets in his way. Michael Chiklis does an excellent job of showing MacKey with all his contradictions, one minute saving a baby from drowning, the next burning a drug dealer on a hot grill.MacKey's boss, David Aceveda played by Benito Martinez is eager to catch him, but balances this against his own political ambitions. Other charactors include Julian (Michael Jace) a Christain patrolman who refuses to accept he is gay and a Dutch (Jay Karnes), a dectective who craves the admiration of his colleagues. The only person we can admire is Claudette Wyms, played by the excelent CCH Pounder. Claudette has no agenda other than to be a good cop and catch the bad guy. She is clever enough to know what both MacKey and Aceveda are up to and they in turn know not to cross the only other cop with the abilty to bring them both down.In the Shield's version of L.A. everyone is a gangster, corrupt politican, corrupt police officer, drug dealer, drug addict or psychotic killer. and often all six. I have never been to Los Angeles and the Shield does nothing to make me want to go there. This is the show's weekness. It is unremitingly grim. All right the life of an L.A. cop cannot be a bundle of laughs but it must have it's lighter moments. It is these that the Shield fails to show. An injection of the occasional bit of humour would go a long way. I am all for crime being shown in all it's horror but man does not live by gunshots and stab wounds alone.Another weakness is the number of near misses that MacKey and his crew have. Always getting away with it by the skin of your teeth gets a bit repetitive.I may be picky but why show the deleted scenes separate from the show? It would have been better to put these in the episodes so we can see them in their correct place.

It also shows how Vic wasn't necessarily ""questionable"" with his methods in the beginning and how he has become a big fish in a chaos-riddled pond by creating a veritable mob with a lovely badge to boot. This thing becomes emboldened by profits from various enterprises, by the sweet smell of success, and rumors of a beautiful Armenian enterprise simply called ""the money train.""As a viewer I cannot stress just how good the show has gotten. It won a Golden Globe by this point for Best Drama Series and Micheal Chiklis won an Emmy/Golden Globe for Lead Actor in a Drama Series. It deserved it, too, because it affords audiences of all types (not all age-ranges) something to watch and doesn't just focus on a linear concept. Quite simply, you do not have to adjust your screen because the picture is indeed perfect.As I'm writing this I just completed the sixth season and can say that it doesn't let up and that many of the things that happen in the 1st and 2nd season sculpt the landscape of things to come. (There are NO spoilers, either, so don't worry aobut reading on) This isn't meant to say that the show is driven by one thing, either, or that it isn't doesn't exist on more than one level. It instead says that the show rewards you, showing you the ironclad ways of an environment that constantly changes and yet remains - in part - the same. You have the main theme that run alongside Vic and his teammates as you see the line and how things blur because of things that are not easily divided into good/bad, and you see clashes of culture everywhere - especially in the department itself.  This is illustrated boldly when shown through Julein's eyes, addressing a conflict on an individual level and also working as a group dynamic, and it shows you just what a blanket party means when you know the person suffering. There are also the rules of the streets, the territories and the politics that run them, and the rules of the governing bodies that want to change them into something controllable for a variety of reasons. This, combined with interesting casework and one of the best illustrations of how profiling the traits of a killer - ala Dutch - works, makes for something that goes well beyond expectation. Some of the best acting I have ever watched comes from this show - even in the minor characters that appear and reappear - and connecting with the show becomes an addictive thillride that is not only watchable but also rewatchable as well.Included in this season are all 13 episodes, some with audio commentary, 5 behind-the-scenes featurettes, 37 deleted scenes, and a preview of the videogame (not recommended) as its features.For reference, the episodes are as follows: 1 - The Quick Fix, 2 - Dead Soldiers, 3 - Partners, 4 - Carte Blanche, 5 - Greenlit, 6 - Homewrecker, 7 - Barnstormers, 8 - Scar Tissue, 9 - CoPilot, 10 - Coyotes, 11 - Inferno, 11 - Inferno, 12 - Breakpoint, 13 - Dominoes Falling.They all feed off each other, none wasting your time as a viewer and none attempting to feel the void between concepts. This is one of the most impressive things to me - normally a show has cracks in the facade but The Shield is solid from beginning to end.Closing, I can't stress just how good this series is besides to say that I have only purchased five series in the thousand or so DVD purchases I've made and that this was one of the top picks I had to have in my collection. It comes highly recommended and will keep you wanting and watching and ready for the next season. When it comes you will do the same all over again, making for a unique experience.I cannot sing its praise loudly enough.",5,Walking Well Beyond the Wild Side,1181692800,"06 13, 2007",2007,3820,"['Strike', 'Team', 'led', 'Vic', 'Mackey', 'become', 'king', 'asphalt', 'jungle', 'how', 'Episode', '9', 'Co-pilot', 'explaining', 'how', 'Barn', 'began', 'how', 'satellite', 'station', 'also', 'how', 'Vic', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'questionable', 'methods', 'beginning', 'how', 'become', 'big', 'fish', 'chaos-riddled', 'pond', 'creating', 'veritable', 'mob', 'lovely', 'badge', 'boot', 'thing', 'emboldened', 'profits', 'various', 'enterprises', 'sweet', 'smell', 'success', 'rumors', 'beautiful', 'Armenian', 'enterprise', 'simply', 'called', 'money', 'train', 'viewer', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'show', 'gotten', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'point', 'Best', 'Drama', 'Series', 'Micheal', 'Chiklis', 'won', 'Emmy/Golden', 'Globe', 'Lead', 'Actor', 'Drama', 'Series', 'deserved', 'too', 'audiences', 'types', 'not', 'age-ranges', 'something', 'watch', ""n't"", 'just', 'focus', 'linear', 'concept', 'Quite', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'adjust', 'screen', 'picture', 'indeed', 'perfect.As', ""'m"", 'writing', 'just', 'completed', 'sixth', 'season', 'can', 'say', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'many', 'things', 'happen', '1st', '2nd', 'season', 'sculpt', 'landscape', 'things', 'come', 'are', 'NO', 'spoilers', 'either', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'aobut', 'reading', ""n't"", 'meant', 'say', 'show', 'driven', 'one', 'thing', 'either', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'exist', 'more', 'one', 'level', 'instead', 'show', 'showing', 'ironclad', 'ways', 'environment', 'constantly', 'changes', 'yet', 'part', 'same', 'have', 'main', 'theme', 'run', 'alongside', 'Vic', 'teammates', 'see', 'line', 'how', 'things', 'blur', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'easily', 'divided', 'good/bad', 'see', 'clashes', 'culture', 'everywhere', 'especially', 'department', 'illustrated', 'boldly', 'when', 'shown', 'Julein', 'eyes', 'addressing', 'conflict', 'individual', 'level', 'also', 'working', 'group', 'dynamic', 'just', 'what', 'blanket', 'party', 'means', 'when', 'know', 'person', 'suffering', 'are', 'also', 'rules', 'streets', 'territories', 'politics', 'run', 'rules', 'governing', 'bodies', 'want', 'change', 'something', 'controllable', 'variety', 'reasons', 'combined', 'interesting', 'casework', 'one', 'best', 'illustrations', 'how', 'profiling', 'traits', 'killer', 'ala', 'Dutch', 'works', 'something', 'well', 'expectation', 'best', 'acting', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'show', 'even', 'minor', 'characters', 'appear', 'reappear', 'connecting', 'show', 'addictive', 'thillride', 'not', 'only', 'watchable', 'also', 'rewatchable', 'well.Included', 'season', 'are', '13', 'episodes', 'audio', 'commentary', '5', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', '37', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'preview', 'videogame', 'not', 'recommended', 'features.For', 'reference', 'episodes', 'are', '1', 'Quick', 'Fix', '2', 'Dead', 'Soldiers', '3', 'Partners', '4', 'Carte', 'Blanche', '5', 'Greenlit', '6', 'Homewrecker', '7', 'Barnstormers', '8', 'Scar', 'Tissue', '9', 'CoPilot', '10', 'Coyotes', '11', 'Inferno', '11', 'Inferno', '12', 'Breakpoint', '13', 'Dominoes', 'Falling.They', 'feed', 'off', 'other', 'none', 'wasting', 'time', 'viewer', 'none', 'attempting', 'feel', 'void', 'concepts', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'things', 'normally', 'show', 'cracks', 'facade', 'Shield', 'solid', 'beginning', 'end.Closing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stress', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'series', 'say', 'have', 'only', 'purchased', 'five', 'series', 'thousand', 'so', 'DVD', 'purchases', ""'ve"", 'made', 'was', 'one', 'top', 'picks', 'had', 'have', 'collection', 'highly', 'recommended', 'will', 'keep', 'wanting', 'watching', 'ready', 'next', 'season', 'When', 'will', 'do', 'same', 'over', 'again', 'making', 'unique', 'experience.I', 'can', 'not', 'sing', 'praise', 'loudly', 'enough']",Shield (Fox): The Complete 2nd Season (Cancelled)
