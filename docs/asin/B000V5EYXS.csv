1098680,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000V5EYXS,Brian E. Erland,"[9, 12]","Synopsis: The '07 made-for-television `Avenging Angel' is a somewhat entertaining western starring Kevin Sorbo as the avenging angel known as ""the Preacher."" You've seen this storyline many times before, idealistic, God-fearing man stands up against evil only to have his family killed and left with nothing but thoughts of revenge. He returns to the scene of the crime one year later and sees the same form of injustice taking place again perpetrated by the same group of bad guys. Looks like a good time for payback.Critique:  Sorry to disappoint all the Sorbo fans out there (which I am one of) but this is not a -5 Star- film. The first thing I found to be quite noticeable was the abrupt breaks in the presentation which of course one should expect in a film made for television. However in this case these interruptions were especially annoying because the storyline always seemed to have advanced during the intermission leaving the viewer to feel as though something had been missed. I also found the dialogue to be predictable and uninspired leading to stilted, predictable and one-dimensional performances.As for Kevin Sorbo? Sorbo is at his best when he is allowed to inject humor and whimsy into his performance. Here in `Avenging Angel' he was confined in a role requiring a stoic, sullen individual. Such a portrayal doesn't play to Kevin's talents and hence doesn't deliver the type of performance his fans have come to expect and enjoy.Positives: Kevin's real life wife Sam Jenkins has a small role at the beginning of the film as his soon to be deceased wife. It's always nice to see them on the screen together.My Rating: Worth a watch, but probably not something to add to your permanent DVD collection unless you're a big fan of the big guy, -3 Stars-.",3,"""Bad Choices Must Run In The Family"" ~ Hercules Meets Pale Rider",1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,1772,"['Synopsis', 'made-for-television', 'Avenging', 'Angel', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'western', 'starring', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'avenging', 'angel', 'known', 'Preacher', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'storyline', 'many', 'times', 'idealistic', 'God-fearing', 'man', 'up', 'evil', 'only', 'have', 'family', 'killed', 'left', 'nothing', 'thoughts', 'revenge', 'scene', 'crime', 'one', 'year', 'later', 'same', 'form', 'injustice', 'taking', 'place', 'again', 'perpetrated', 'same', 'group', 'bad', 'guys', 'good', 'time', 'payback.Critique', 'Sorry', 'disappoint', 'Sorbo', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'am', 'one', 'not', '-5', 'Star-', 'film', 'first', 'thing', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'noticeable', 'was', 'abrupt', 'breaks', 'presentation', 'course', 'one', 'should', 'expect', 'film', 'made', 'television', 'However', 'case', 'interruptions', 'were', 'especially', 'annoying', 'storyline', 'always', 'seemed', 'have', 'advanced', 'intermission', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'feel', 'something', 'had', 'been', 'missed', 'also', 'found', 'dialogue', 'be', 'predictable', 'uninspired', 'leading', 'stilted', 'predictable', 'one-dimensional', 'performances.As', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'Sorbo', 'best', 'when', 'allowed', 'inject', 'humor', 'whimsy', 'performance', 'Here', 'Avenging', 'Angel', 'was', 'confined', 'role', 'requiring', 'stoic', 'sullen', 'individual', 'portrayal', ""n't"", 'play', 'Kevin', 'talents', 'hence', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'type', 'performance', 'fans', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'enjoy.Positives', 'Kevin', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'Sam', 'Jenkins', 'small', 'role', 'beginning', 'film', 'soon', 'be', 'deceased', 'wife', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'screen', 'together.My', 'Rating', 'watch', 'probably', 'not', 'something', 'add', 'permanent', 'DVD', 'collection', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'big', 'guy', '-3', 'Stars-']",Avenging Angel

""Avenging Angel"" is, nevertheless, an entertaining film that contains all of the right elements to please western fans (clear-cut heroes and villains; assorted gun fights; a girl whom you know that our hero will end up with in the end); Sorbo, as usual, is likeable enough to make us care for his character; and the plot is a lot easier to follow and has a much more satisfying ending than Sorbo's other made-for-television western, ""Prarie Fever"". Being made for television and clearly targeted at a family audience, there is very little in this film that is likely to offend anyone. No one ever swears, everyone keeps their clothes on and even though some people do get killed, there is never any blood. Futhermore, there are no moral grey zones - the villains are purely evil and the hero is purely good. There's even a nice little sub-plot about Sorbo's character finding happiness with a single mother and her daughter.

I watched many of the Hercules episodes with moderate interest but this was actually an entertaining western.  Though the story was common and a bit predictable it was well paced with very good acting and the action sequences were well balanced by the drama and story.I will have to give some other Kevin Sorbo films a view as a result of this.This was a made for TV western about a preacher (Kevin Sorbo) who looses his wife and daughter, murdered by the henchmen of a powerful and greedy land barren played by Klaus Hauser.  I saw his name at the beginning credits but did not recognise him until well into the movie.  He played the part well.  Sorbo, as The Preacher, turns from a man of God to a bounty hunter exacting revenge, but his actions nag at his conscience.  Eventually he comes to an understanding of who he is and what he needs to do.  Fine performance by Mr. Sorbo.This is more than a moderately entertaining western.  They did a good job keeping the story flowing especially considering the limitations that network television puts on time.
