I enjoy these old westerns (black&white) because you get to see these actors when they were young. Wagner looks to be around 23. When Dale Robinson comes into the scene I just smiled. I have Robinson's Wells Fargo series. I have come to realize the older you get the more you long for things from your past. This is turning out to be a good western. At this point only Rory Calhoun hasn't appeared. Calhoun was a western star as well. Western lovers, this is what you want.
