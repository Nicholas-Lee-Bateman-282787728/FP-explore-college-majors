I think this is completely personal to my child, your child may like it just as much as number 1.

1115898,ATJ47ZS435GZT,B000Y1NNH2,liz56,"[0, 0]","My child has been watching the entire Baby Babble series since he was about a year old. He is 17 months old now and many of his first words (SPEAKING words, not just sign language) have come from watching these videos. Words like baby, daddy, mommy, up, down, out, more, truck, please, thank you, all done, eat, and countless others. The videos are designed to hold the short attention span of young children, and they definitely do. The intervals of music, incorporation of sounds, talking, simple objects, etc. ---all of those are specifically directed toward babies and toddlers. In my opinion, this series is better than Baby Einstein, Brainy Baby, etc. for the older baby/young toddler. It might be &#34;too educational&#34; for the really young baby. But, from 9 months to age 2 1/2 or maybe even older, I would say this series is THE BEST out there for speech, learning, and &#34;quiet time.&#34;. The series even focuses on certain letters like p,b, and m or t, d, n which directly coincides with the appropriate level of speech that a child is capable of learning as he/she grows. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ENTIRE BABY BABLE SERIES (There are 3 in the series.) Oh and as an added benefit, the videos are quite calming for the parents and the creators' approach toward teaching the concepts is actually quite fascinating.  A nice break from some of the &#34;annoying&#34; shows and DVDs that are out there for kids. And an overall great way to expose your child to language/learning. One of the best products we invested in during my son's first year and a half of life for sure.",5,"Excellent!

1115901,A1XN767DEW2TJL,B000Y1NNH2,"M. Walters ""Aspiring writer""","[0, 0]","I purchased Baby Babble and Baby Babble 2 for my two grandsons, aged 13 mos. and 33 mos. old.  They have thoroughly enjoyed watching the DVDs and are learning a lot from them.  The youngest one laughs and giggles while watching, and attempts to make the sounds as they are prompted on the program.  The nearly 3 year old is speech-delayed, and these DVDs have been an absolute blessing in terms of how he is learning from watching them.  He has never been very intersted in watching DVDs or television for any length of time, but since purchasing these two DVDs he sits and watches the entire program, attempting to say the words and sounds as they are prompted.  In fact, the day they arrived in the mail, they were both at our house, and when I put the first DVD in, he sat down to watch and was excited and participated throughout the entire program.  He then asked to watch it 4 more times that day before his daddy picked them up after work.  Because of their enthusiasm I purchased another set for them to take home and watch with their parents.  They want to watch them every day, here or at home.  It has helped the oldest grandson so much in his speech, and I just can't say enough about these products.  I highly recommend them to anyone wanting to enhance the learning of their little ones.  They are priced right, and certainly well worth the money.",5,Baby Babble  and Baby Babble 2,1252540800,"09 10, 2009",2009,1361,"['purchased', 'Baby', 'Babble', 'Baby', 'Babble', '2', 'two', 'grandsons', 'aged', '13', 'mos', '33', 'mos', 'old', 'have', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'DVDs', 'are', 'learning', 'lot', 'youngest', 'one', 'laughs', 'giggles', 'watching', 'attempts', 'make', 'sounds', 'are', 'prompted', 'program', 'nearly', '3', 'year', 'old', 'speech-delayed', 'DVDs', 'have', 'been', 'absolute', 'blessing', 'terms', 'how', 'learning', 'watching', 'never', 'been', 'very', 'intersted', 'watching', 'DVDs', 'television', 'length', 'time', 'purchasing', 'two', 'DVDs', 'entire', 'program', 'attempting', 'say', 'words', 'sounds', 'are', 'prompted', 'fact', 'day', 'arrived', 'mail', 'were', 'house', 'when', 'put', 'first', 'DVD', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'was', 'excited', 'participated', 'entire', 'program', 'then', 'asked', 'watch', '4', 'more', 'times', 'day', 'daddy', 'picked', 'up', 'work', 'enthusiasm', 'purchased', 'set', 'take', 'home', 'watch', 'parents', 'want', 'watch', 'day', 'here', 'home', 'helped', 'oldest', 'grandson', 'so', 'much', 'speech', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'products', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'enhance', 'learning', 'little', 'ones', 'are', 'priced', 'right', 'certainly', 'well', 'money']",Baby Babble 2 - P B M
1115902,AO3PQNT2PUA9H,B000Y1NNH2,O. Fischer,"[0, 0]","I have a 3 year old who didn't seem interested in talking until she was two (though she had sign language). Her preschool director thought she was coming along and to give her more time so she hasn't been to speech therapy but I'd been doing research and found my way to this dvd series & their book.This dvd concentrates on the sounds p b and m, and if you sound those out you'll notice it's the same mouth motion for each one with the difference being in vibrating your vocal cords or keeping your mouth shut (they explain that in a separate parent tutorial). This allows them to change the content and vocab words but the child is still practicing the same mouth motion and developing the muscle memory. I watch with my kids usually and when there is silence we'll chime in a description of what's on the screen (""A ball! It's spinning! Round and round"" etc)making this an interactive experience between us.While I was concentrating getting my first born to speak, my second born was watching and learning every bit and has ended up being a very accomplished early talker. While she was born with that inclination, I have no doubt that my new found ability to provide clean information made learning easier and less frustrating. For my speech delayed child, she locked on to this as useful information and immediately had improvement in pronunciation. So I recommend this video for any baby/toddler -- speech delay or not, and I certainly recommend this before some of the time-waster entertainment-only DVDs.I realize we live in an age of state of the art digitized technology with all manner of gizmos and noise to fascinate and distract children -- but I think it lends a certain amount of cacophony that doesn't help the learning child.  The simple ""low budget"" presentation of this DVD is a teaching foundation that I've taken and applied to other situations. I've become more conscious about describing what I'm doing in a simple repetitive manner in my daily interactions (I'm not a chatterbox, so it wasn't a natural inclination). I'm a much better teacher for my kids from these videos. It goes into the parenting 101 category for me and I've been sure to recommend it to other parents.",5,Educational for mom & dad too,1359072000,"01 25, 2013",2013,2198,"['have', '3', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'interested', 'talking', 'was', 'two', 'had', 'sign', 'language', 'preschool', 'director', 'thought', 'was', 'coming', 'along', 'give', 'more', 'time', ""n't"", 'been', 'speech', 'therapy', ""'d"", 'been', 'doing', 'research', 'found', 'way', 'dvd', 'series', 'book.This', 'dvd', 'concentrates', 'sounds', 'p', 'b', 'm', 'sound', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'same', 'mouth', 'motion', 'one', 'difference', 'being', 'vibrating', 'vocal', 'cords', 'keeping', 'mouth', 'shut', 'explain', 'separate', 'parent', 'tutorial', 'change', 'content', 'vocab', 'words', 'child', 'still', 'practicing', 'same', 'mouth', 'motion', 'developing', 'muscle', 'memory', 'watch', 'kids', 'usually', 'when', 'silence', ""'ll"", 'chime', 'description', 'what', 'screen', 'ball', 'spinning', 'Round', 'round', 'etc', 'making', 'interactive', 'experience', 'us.While', 'was', 'concentrating', 'getting', 'first', 'born', 'speak', 'second', 'born', 'was', 'watching', 'learning', 'bit', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'very', 'accomplished', 'early', 'talker', 'was', 'born', 'inclination', 'have', 'doubt', 'new', 'found', 'ability', 'provide', 'clean', 'information', 'made', 'learning', 'easier', 'less', 'frustrating', 'speech', 'delayed', 'child', 'locked', 'useful', 'information', 'immediately', 'had', 'improvement', 'pronunciation', 'recommend', 'video', 'baby/toddler', 'speech', 'delay', 'not', 'certainly', 'recommend', 'time-waster', 'entertainment-only', 'DVDs.I', 'realize', 'live', 'age', 'state', 'art', 'digitized', 'technology', 'manner', 'gizmos', 'noise', 'fascinate', 'distract', 'children', 'think', 'certain', 'amount', 'cacophony', ""n't"", 'help', 'learning', 'child', 'simple', 'low', 'budget', 'presentation', 'DVD', 'teaching', 'foundation', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'applied', 'other', 'situations', ""'ve"", 'become', 'more', 'conscious', 'describing', 'what', ""'m"", 'doing', 'simple', 'repetitive', 'manner', 'daily', 'interactions', ""'m"", 'not', 'chatterbox', 'was', ""n't"", 'natural', 'inclination', ""'m"", 'much', 'better', 'teacher', 'kids', 'videos', 'parenting', '101', 'category', ""'ve"", 'been', 'sure', 'recommend', 'other', 'parents']",Baby Babble 2 - P B M

I would have been ok with this, but they also did not have any close-ups of humans saying the words, and no children were in the video at all. I was expecting something a little better--my son enjoys watching toddlers/preschoolers talk and needs to see the mouths move to figure out how to make the sounds. In this DVD a woman is shown speaking somewhat clearly 3 or 4 times. The rest is a hand pushing a toy across the screen while the word is being spoken. ""Train"" while a train is pushed across the screen with no human faces in the picture. No signing is included until the last 30 minutes, and it is just a tutorial for the parents, it does not help the kids at all. I was disappointed to say the least. My son watched less than 10 minutes. I highly recommend the Baby Einstein videos, he will sit and watch the whole 30 minutes 2 or 3 times in a row and repeat the words, and he learned 3 or 4 of the words within 2 days AND will sign them.
