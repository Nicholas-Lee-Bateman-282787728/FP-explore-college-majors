941865,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000BGH2JU,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[14, 17]","A white schoolteacher is raped by 5 men when her stagecoach is attacked. An Apache warrior comes in to save her and nurses her back to health. He tries several times to return her to other whites, but she stays with him. Finally he trains her how to shoot and she tracks down and kills the rapists. Unfortunately, she goes mad, the sheriff shows up and shoots the Apache as a heathen. The Apache (and his few friends that you see briefly) are both very stereotyped and usually shown in western style clothing.This could have been an excellent story about a straight laced woman learning the beauty of nature, a white woman learning to trust a red man, a woman learning how to shoot and ride, etc. etc. Instead there are jarring cut scenes, really bizarre Zardoz-style music, and gratuitous nudity. The stereotypes are really clear. Yes, part of the point of the movie is that everyone assumes the indians must be involved and the ""hero"" is shot without even a second glance. However, the Indians are dressed as you might imagine one in a Halloween costume. I suppose the three or four words used could be authentic, but there is no real sense of culture, or language, or song, or anything else here.The relationship seems very forced and unnatural. The dialogue is pretty cheezy at times. Even the lure of gorgeous scenery - which usually is found in great plenty in movies like this - is missing. Things are faded, grainy, and look as if it was shot on a back lot of Hollywood. I really found the heroine's voice to be quite odd - almost as if she were a cartoon mouse or something.Again, it could've been an excellent story and a stunning movie. It just never made it.",2,Stereotypes and Poor Dialogue / Costumes / etc.,1153699200,"07 24, 2006",2006,1670,"['white', 'schoolteacher', 'raped', '5', 'men', 'when', 'stagecoach', 'attacked', 'Apache', 'warrior', 'save', 'back', 'health', 'several', 'times', 'return', 'other', 'whites', 'Finally', 'how', 'shoot', 'down', 'rapists', 'Unfortunately', 'mad', 'sheriff', 'up', 'shoots', 'Apache', 'heathen', 'Apache', 'few', 'friends', 'see', 'briefly', 'are', 'very', 'stereotyped', 'usually', 'shown', 'western', 'style', 'clothing.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'story', 'straight', 'laced', 'woman', 'learning', 'beauty', 'nature', 'white', 'woman', 'learning', 'trust', 'red', 'man', 'woman', 'learning', 'how', 'shoot', 'ride', 'etc', 'etc', 'Instead', 'are', 'jarring', 'cut', 'scenes', 'really', 'bizarre', 'Zardoz-style', 'music', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'really', 'clear', 'Yes', 'part', 'point', 'movie', 'everyone', 'indians', 'must', 'be', 'involved', 'hero', 'shot', 'even', 'second', 'glance', 'However', 'Indians', 'are', 'dressed', 'might', 'imagine', 'one', 'Halloween', 'costume', 'suppose', 'three', 'four', 'words', 'used', 'could', 'be', 'authentic', 'real', 'sense', 'culture', 'language', 'song', 'anything', 'else', 'here.The', 'relationship', 'very', 'forced', 'unnatural', 'dialogue', 'pretty', 'cheezy', 'times', 'Even', 'lure', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'usually', 'found', 'great', 'plenty', 'movies', 'missing', 'Things', 'are', 'faded', 'grainy', 'look', 'was', 'shot', 'back', 'lot', 'Hollywood', 'really', 'found', 'heroine', 'voice', 'be', 'quite', 'odd', 'almost', 'were', 'cartoon', 'mouse', 'something.Again', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'excellent', 'story', 'stunning', 'movie', 'just', 'never', 'made']",N/A

Other reviewers have told the plot, sometimes relating spoilers that give everything away. But I disagree with them on several counts.The most sympathetic person is the Apache played by Henry Silva. Furthermore, he and the other Native Americans wear authentic garb, not ""costumes.""Keenan Wynn gives a great portrayal of a truly despicable character, and you'll love what happens to him. That, and the other events that conclude the film, make sense if you keep an open mind about it. And it's obvious what is about to happen as the movie ends.As for the video quality: don't expect a Criterion release. But the West is shown as it undoubtedly was: blazingly hot, dry, and merciless.P.S.

941868,AP3V63JVKLEO5,B000BGH2JU,Sherman A. Thompson,"[0, 1]","This could have been a great movie, but had too many flaws. It started out with a distant scene of a stagecoach moving across a desert panorama.  I immediately noticed the erratic panning of the camera, like the cameraman was drunk. The casting was great, as was the plot premise, but the screenwriting, directing, and execution of the story line were terrible, a real disappointment. There were also many technical errors. The outlaw must have been taking a dump in his underwear because when he was blasted out of the back of the outhouse his bottom flap was closed. I also question the believability of an outhouse in such an isolated spot. The Apaches did, however, look believable with their long hair and sweatbands. The schoolteacher's hair looked like she had just been to a Beverly Hills salon. The desert boots made for her were also too slender and chick, not roomy like real Apache desert moccasins with leggings. The overly melodramatic and depressing ending really sucked. Turns out this was obviously a ""message"" film. I'm sorry I wasted my time watching this flop when I could have been sleeping.",2,This flop could have been a great movie,1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,1112,"['could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'movie', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'flaws', 'started', 'out', 'distant', 'scene', 'stagecoach', 'moving', 'desert', 'panorama', 'immediately', 'noticed', 'erratic', 'panning', 'camera', 'cameraman', 'was', 'drunk', 'casting', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'plot', 'premise', 'screenwriting', 'directing', 'execution', 'story', 'line', 'were', 'terrible', 'real', 'disappointment', 'were', 'also', 'many', 'technical', 'errors', 'outlaw', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'taking', 'dump', 'underwear', 'when', 'was', 'blasted', 'back', 'outhouse', 'bottom', 'flap', 'was', 'closed', 'also', 'question', 'believability', 'outhouse', 'such', 'isolated', 'spot', 'Apaches', 'did', 'however', 'look', 'believable', 'long', 'hair', 'sweatbands', 'schoolteacher', 'hair', 'looked', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'salon', 'desert', 'boots', 'made', 'were', 'also', 'too', 'slender', 'chick', 'not', 'roomy', 'real', 'Apache', 'desert', 'moccasins', 'leggings', 'overly', 'melodramatic', 'depressing', 'ending', 'really', 'sucked', 'out', 'was', 'obviously', 'message', 'film', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'wasted', 'time', 'watching', 'flop', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'sleeping']",N/A

The colors are washed out and it is pan-and-scan.  I think this film tried to show the vast emptiness of the west but the cinematography is lost in this DVD.  I think(although I don't know) that this edition has been edited.  There are a couple of abrupt splices.  As it is, a few unsettling scenes remain.  Just as an aside, Michele Carey has a very strange voice.  Almost like a cartoon character or small child.  She's a stunner though.
