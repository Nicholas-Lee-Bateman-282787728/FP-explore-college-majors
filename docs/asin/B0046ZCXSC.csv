While the TV version of Patterns was well received the movie version did not fare well at the box office.Perhaps it was because paying audiences of almost 60 years ago were unwilling to view the dark underbelly of the corporate world. There is the domineering corporate head played by Everett Sloan, his yes men, the loyal and sometimes catty secretaries, a worn out vice president that needs to go, and his subordinate who admires him. Ed Begley was at his best as vulnerable uncertain characters. He is the vice president who at 62 is too fearful and proud to resign. Van Heflin is his up and coming assistant. Unknown to both, their chief is engineering one's resignation and the other's success. Serling had the camera effectively reflect the point of view of the actors, a glimpse of what was later to be in The Twilight Zone.Maybe Serling experienced some of what he wrote of as he navigated the treacherous corporations of television and Hollywood? Both he and Begley's character made unexpected exits from this life.",5,I did it my way,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,1174,"['Mostly', 'remembered', 'short', 'stories', 'TV', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Night', 'Gallery', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'also', 'wrote', 'full', 'length', 'stories', 'screenplays', 'TV', 'version', 'Patterns', 'was', 'well', 'received', 'movie', 'version', 'did', 'not', 'fare', 'well', 'box', 'was', 'paying', 'audiences', 'almost', '60', 'years', 'ago', 'were', 'unwilling', 'view', 'dark', 'underbelly', 'corporate', 'world', 'domineering', 'corporate', 'head', 'played', 'Everett', 'Sloan', 'yes', 'men', 'loyal', 'sometimes', 'catty', 'secretaries', 'worn', 'out', 'vice', 'president', 'go', 'subordinate', 'who', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'was', 'best', 'vulnerable', 'uncertain', 'characters', 'vice', 'president', 'who', '62', 'too', 'fearful', 'proud', 'resign', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'up', 'coming', 'assistant', 'Unknown', 'chief', 'engineering', 'one', 'resignation', 'other', 'success', 'Serling', 'had', 'camera', 'effectively', 'reflect', 'point', 'view', 'actors', 'glimpse', 'what', 'was', 'later', 'be', 'Twilight', 'Zone.Maybe', 'Serling', 'experienced', 'what', 'wrote', 'navigated', 'treacherous', 'corporations', 'television', 'Hollywood', 'Begley', 'character', 'made', 'unexpected', 'exits', 'life']",N/A
1387947,A1FBMC893ERT8N,B0046ZCXSC,Tony Harris,"[10, 10]","The dominant factor in this movie is the writer, the brilliant Rod Serling. Also the actors and direction are excellent. It reminded me a lot of one of Rod Serling's Twilight Zone episodes-A Stop at Willoughby. In that episode an executive is hounded by his loud mouth boss until he exits a moving train for a world he invented in his mind. While there is no Shangri La called Willoughby, there is a loud mouth boss that chronically belittles one of his underlings. In this case, the man being yelled at is William Briggs, played by Ed Begly. One gets the impression that Briggs, being in his 60s, is the victim of age discrimination. His boss, the ruthless Mr Ramsey, wants to replace him with a younger man. The pattern starts with Mr. Briggs' longtime secretary being taken away and assigned to the new guy, Fred Staples. Things continue to deteriorate for Briggs as he continually gets shot down by Ramsey, while Ramsey lavishes praise on Staples.It's beautifully done, and even the names that Mr Serling gives his characters have some significance. Briggs is sort of a prisoner, and a brig is a prison. Ramsey,of course, was the ruthless ruler of Egypt with an ego to match. As for Staples, well, a stable gun is an office tool, just as Mr. Staples is used by Ramsey as a tool to get rid of Briggs. Get it? Very clever, that Rod Serling!",5,The Hand of Rod Serling is Evident,1286928000,"10 13, 2010",2010,1342,"['dominant', 'factor', 'movie', 'writer', 'brilliant', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'Also', 'actors', 'direction', 'are', 'excellent', 'reminded', 'lot', 'one', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episodes-A', 'Stop', 'Willoughby', 'episode', 'executive', 'hounded', 'loud', 'mouth', 'boss', 'moving', 'train', 'world', 'invented', 'mind', 'Shangri', 'La', 'called', 'Willoughby', 'loud', 'mouth', 'chronically', 'one', 'underlings', 'case', 'man', 'being', 'yelled', 'William', 'Briggs', 'played', 'Ed', 'Begly', 'One', 'impression', 'Briggs', 'being', '60s', 'victim', 'age', 'discrimination', 'boss', 'ruthless', 'Mr', 'Ramsey', 'replace', 'younger', 'man', 'pattern', 'Mr.', 'Briggs', 'longtime', 'secretary', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'assigned', 'new', 'guy', 'Fred', 'Staples', 'Things', 'continue', 'deteriorate', 'Briggs', 'continually', 'shot', 'down', 'Ramsey', 'Ramsey', 'lavishes', 'praise', 'Staples.It', 'beautifully', 'done', 'even', 'names', 'Mr', 'Serling', 'characters', 'have', 'significance', 'Briggs', 'sort', 'prisoner', 'brig', 'prison', 'Ramsey', 'course', 'was', 'ruthless', 'ruler', 'Egypt', 'ego', 'match', 'Staples', 'well', 'stable', 'gun', 'office', 'tool', 'just', 'Mr', 'Staples', 'used', 'Ramsey', 'tool', 'get', 'rid', 'Briggs', 'Get', 'Very', 'clever', 'Rod', 'Serling']",N/A
