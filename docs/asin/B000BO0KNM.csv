946046,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B000BO0KNM,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[0, 1]","Sitcoms are an anomoly.  While they can be very good (like Seinfeld), they all tend to follow a similar formula, and lately, every sitcom seems to be a carbon copy of another existing one.  However, every once in a while, a show comes along and breaks the mold.  Titus was one of those shows.  While it did have many properties of sitcoms, such as the camera set-up and inclusion of a laugh track (well, they claim that the laughter came from a live studio audience, and I'll believe them until I see proof of the alternative), it was in no way a copy of shows that had come before it, and it broke new ground in terms of humor and edgyness.  One of the show's most interesting aspects is the use of the ""neutral space"", a black-and-white room where Titus is able to narrate the events, give perspective, and even a little comedy every now and then.  The show is extremely dark, and it would be depressing if they weren't able to make it so funny.The show is based on the life of star Christopher Titus; he had a very troubled, or in his words, screwed-up, childhood.  His mother was certifiably insane and his father was an alcoholic womanizer whose concept of tough love leaves very little room for love.  Many of the events depicted in the series actually happened to him in his life (and thus his family had to sign release forms).The season picks up a few months after the car crash of Season 2, and the gang is back up to their old antics.  This year, Titus and Erin (Cynthia Watros) try to adopt Erin's niece Amy (Rachel Roth), who was living in filth due to her drug-addicted parents.  Amy is funny, but doesn't really add anything to the show besides insults (sometimes she's funny, sometimes she just shows up and delivers an insult).  However, she did allow for the great episode ""Errr"", in which we see a teenage Titus try to woo Erin.  The best stuff revolves around the dynamic of the core group.  Titus is the leader, in a sense, even though his plans aren't always sane.  Tommy (David Shatraw), his friend, is kind of his sidekick, and he tends to act in an ambiguously homosexual manner.  Titus' brother Dave (Zack Ward) is another kind of sidekick figure, though he is definitely more for comic relief purposes than Tommy, who is more of a story driver.  Dave is extremely stupid, and tends to make bad situations worse or just say things that are extremely bizarre (yet hilarious).  Finally, Ken (Stacey Keach), Titus' dad, is both a hero and a villain.  He exists to make his family miserable, but at the end of the day, he's a guy you want on your side.This year had some really landmark episodes.  ""Tommy's Not Gay"" is very funny, but it is also very poignant.  Tommy learns that his father is gay, and he comes to hate him for it.  In the neutral space, Titus contemplates the idea of homosexuality and why prejudiced hatred is such a problem.  In ""The Protector"", Titus and Erin discover a reason for Amy's troubled behavior.  The episode, which actually got delayed until the end of the season because the censors were so upset about it (which screwed up continuity), deals with Amy admitting that the father of a childhood friend molested her, and Titus and Erin weren't sure how to deal with it.  Finally, in ""Insanity Genetic, Parts 1 and 2"", Titus has to come to grips with the death of his mom (now played by Connie Stevens) and the fact that he may have inherited her insanity.  In addition to being absolutely hilarious, the episodes are also very sad.Sadly, the show was cancelled.  I'm pretty sure that low ratings were a part of it, but the network just didn't like it (also, according to the opening monologue by Titus, he called the executives stupid a lot).  The show was just too edgy and too dark, and they didn't want to take any more chances with it.  It's too bad, because they killed a great show that wasn't afraid to be truthful in addition to being funny.  As for the way it ended, I'm not sure if the finale episodes were intended to be the series finale, or just a season finale, but they definitely work as both.  As a season finale, it works because Titus would come back 3 months later, but then again, it almost seems as if the entire series was leading up to what happened at the end.  Well, now we'll never know.Titus is great.  If you've never seen it, I highly reccomend it.  It's not for everyone, you definitely need to be able to laugh at things you wouldn't normally laugh at, but for those that can, this is a lost gem.",5,The Final Season of A Truly Great Show,1141344000,"03 3, 2006",2006,4481,"['Sitcoms', 'are', 'anomoly', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'Seinfeld', 'tend', 'follow', 'similar', 'formula', 'lately', 'sitcom', 'be', 'carbon', 'copy', 'existing', 'one', 'However', 'once', 'while', 'show', 'along', 'breaks', 'mold', 'Titus', 'was', 'one', 'shows', 'did', 'have', 'many', 'properties', 'sitcoms', 'such', 'camera', 'set-up', 'inclusion', 'laugh', 'track', 'well', 'claim', 'laughter', 'came', 'live', 'studio', 'audience', ""'ll"", 'believe', 'see', 'proof', 'alternative', 'was', 'way', 'copy', 'shows', 'had', 'come', 'broke', 'new', 'ground', 'terms', 'humor', 'edgyness', 'One', 'show', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'use', 'neutral', 'space', 'black-and-white', 'room', 'where', 'Titus', 'able', 'narrate', 'events', 'give', 'perspective', 'even', 'little', 'comedy', 'now', 'then', 'show', 'extremely', 'dark', 'would', 'be', 'depressing', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'make', 'funny.The', 'show', 'based', 'life', 'star', 'Christopher', 'Titus', 'had', 'very', 'troubled', 'words', 'screwed-up', 'childhood', 'mother', 'was', 'certifiably', 'insane', 'father', 'was', 'alcoholic', 'womanizer', 'concept', 'tough', 'love', 'very', 'little', 'room', 'love', 'Many', 'events', 'depicted', 'series', 'actually', 'happened', 'life', 'thus', 'family', 'had', 'sign', 'release', 'forms', '.The', 'season', 'up', 'few', 'months', 'car', 'crash', 'Season', '2', 'gang', 'back', 'up', 'old', 'antics', 'year', 'Titus', 'Erin', 'Cynthia', 'Watros', 'try', 'adopt', 'Erin', 'niece', 'Amy', 'Rachel', 'Roth', 'who', 'was', 'living', 'filth', 'due', 'drug-addicted', 'parents', 'Amy', 'funny', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'anything', 'show', 'insults', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'just', 'up', 'delivers', 'insult', 'However', 'did', 'allow', 'great', 'episode', 'Errr', 'see', 'teenage', 'Titus', 'try', 'woo', 'Erin', 'best', 'stuff', 'dynamic', 'core', 'group', 'Titus', 'leader', 'sense', 'even', 'plans', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'sane', 'Tommy', 'David', 'Shatraw', 'friend', 'kind', 'sidekick', 'act', 'ambiguously', 'homosexual', 'manner', 'Titus', 'brother', 'Dave', 'Zack', 'Ward', 'kind', 'sidekick', 'figure', 'definitely', 'more', 'comic', 'relief', 'purposes', 'Tommy', 'who', 'more', 'story', 'driver', 'Dave', 'extremely', 'stupid', 'make', 'bad', 'situations', 'worse', 'just', 'say', 'things', 'are', 'extremely', 'bizarre', 'yet', 'hilarious', 'Finally', 'Ken', 'Stacey', 'Keach', 'Titus', 'dad', 'hero', 'villain', 'make', 'family', 'miserable', 'end', 'day', 'guy', 'want', 'side.This', 'year', 'had', 'really', 'landmark', 'episodes', 'Tommy', 'Not', 'Gay', 'very', 'funny', 'also', 'very', 'poignant', 'Tommy', 'father', 'gay', 'hate', 'neutral', 'space', 'Titus', 'idea', 'homosexuality', 'why', 'prejudiced', 'hatred', 'such', 'problem', 'Protector', 'Titus', 'Erin', 'discover', 'reason', 'Amy', 'troubled', 'behavior', 'episode', 'actually', 'got', 'delayed', 'end', 'season', 'censors', 'were', 'so', 'upset', 'screwed', 'up', 'continuity', 'deals', 'Amy', 'admitting', 'father', 'childhood', 'friend', 'molested', 'Titus', 'Erin', 'were', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'deal', 'Finally', 'Insanity', 'Genetic', 'Parts', '1', '2', 'Titus', 'come', 'grips', 'death', 'mom', 'now', 'played', 'Connie', 'Stevens', 'fact', 'may', 'have', 'inherited', 'insanity', 'addition', 'being', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'sad.Sadly', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'low', 'ratings', 'were', 'part', 'network', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'also', 'according', 'opening', 'monologue', 'Titus', 'called', 'executives', 'stupid', 'lot', 'show', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'edgy', 'too', 'dark', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'take', 'more', 'chances', 'too', 'bad', 'killed', 'great', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'be', 'truthful', 'addition', 'being', 'funny', 'way', 'ended', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'finale', 'episodes', 'were', 'intended', 'be', 'series', 'finale', 'just', 'season', 'finale', 'definitely', 'work', 'season', 'finale', 'Titus', 'would', 'come', 'back', '3', 'months', 'later', 'then', 'again', 'almost', 'entire', 'series', 'was', 'leading', 'up', 'what', 'happened', 'end', 'Well', 'now', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know.Titus', 'great', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'highly', 'reccomend', 'not', 'everyone', 'definitely', 'need', 'be', 'able', 'laugh', 'things', 'would', ""n't"", 'normally', 'laugh', 'can', 'lost', 'gem']",N/A

It almost seemed as though the writers sensed that the show was on the chopping block and tried to cram more melodrama in before they were cancelled.

That's one mighty unlucky teen.  I understand that Christopher Titus had an unusually rough childhood, but this was completely over the top.

946049,A1BMQA5PIZKU1P,B000BO0KNM,"Bryan ""Dragonboots""","[9, 11]","A very unique show but killed off for that very reason. The interview with Stacy Keach will vouch for that(in the bonus materials). I think it's very likely it was taken off the air due to the plot of the 2 part episode. There will never be another show like this one. Taking the darkest moments in life(or family) and turning it into 22 hillarious minutes. Season 3 went to more extremes, and on occassion a bit dramatic, than the previous seasons and also some new characters are introduced(Titus' sister & Grandmother, Tommy's Dad, etc). Both DVD sets are worth buying if you are NOT easily offended. If you think shows like SEINFELD and THAT 70s SHOW are edgy, then you have never seen one single episode of TITUS. Great show. It's too bad Fox took it off the air. The interviews with the cast are the best I've seen for a TV show dvd(but where was the actor who played Tommy? MIA) and there are also about 27 minutes worth of bloopers & outtakes from all 3 seasons to watch that are not mentioned on the back of the DVD. That was nice little surprise... but be prepared for a lot of foul language! The commentaries are also fun to listen to. Highly recommended DVD.

946059,A1F1FOR46702YF,B000BO0KNM,R. J Rey,"[0, 0]","After three seasons of profoundly dysfunctional family antics, comedian Christopher Titus' hilarious comedy series comes to a close. ""Titus"" is the very funny half-hour comedy that chronicles the life of Christopher Titus (Himself) and his messed-up family including his loving girlfriend Erin (Cynthia Watros), his clueless brother Dave (Zack Ward), his emotional friend Tommy (David Shatraw) and his drunken father Ken (Stacy Keach). In its third and final season, Titus must also deal with Erin's troubled niece Amy (Rachel Roth) and his ""perfect"" sister Shannon (Elizabeth Berkley). ""Titus"" is the outrageously funny Fox comedy based on comedian Christopher Titus' stand up routine. Each episode is narrated by Titus from his ""neutral space"" who offers some side-splitting comments and humorous flashbacks from his childhood and teenage years. The comedy series features some great humor and good comic performances. The amusing interplay between Christopher and his father is one of the show's biggest highlights. The third season includes such amusing episodes like ""Tommy's Not Gay"", ""Shannon's Song"", ""Grandma Titus"", ""After Mrs. Shafter"" and ""The Protector"".Though Fox cancelled ""Titus"", you can once again experience all its edgy humor on DVD with ""Titus: Seasons 3"". The final 21 episodes of ""Titus"" are presented in their original full screen format. This 4-Disc box set contains a clear picture quality and a good 2.0 Dolby Digital sound. Its special features include interviews with stars Cynthia Watros, Zack Ward and Stacy Keach, over 25 minutes of bloopers and audio commentaries with star Christopher Titus and series creators Brian Hargrove and Jack Kenny on three episodes. Overall, ""Titus: Season 3"" obtains satisfying ""B"".",4,Any Ending is Painful,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,1744,"['three', 'seasons', 'profoundly', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'antics', 'comedian', 'Christopher', 'Titus', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'series', 'close', 'Titus', 'very', 'funny', 'half-hour', 'comedy', 'life', 'Christopher', 'Titus', 'Himself', 'messed-up', 'family', 'including', 'loving', 'girlfriend', 'Erin', 'Cynthia', 'Watros', 'clueless', 'brother', 'Dave', 'Zack', 'Ward', 'emotional', 'friend', 'Tommy', 'David', 'Shatraw', 'drunken', 'father', 'Ken', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'third', 'final', 'season', 'Titus', 'must', 'also', 'deal', 'Erin', 'troubled', 'niece', 'Amy', 'Rachel', 'Roth', 'perfect', 'sister', 'Shannon', 'Elizabeth', 'Berkley', 'Titus', 'outrageously', 'funny', 'Fox', 'comedy', 'based', 'comedian', 'Christopher', 'Titus', 'stand', 'up', 'routine', 'episode', 'narrated', 'Titus', 'neutral', 'space', 'who', 'side-splitting', 'comments', 'humorous', 'flashbacks', 'childhood', 'teenage', 'years', 'comedy', 'series', 'great', 'humor', 'good', 'comic', 'performances', 'amusing', 'interplay', 'Christopher', 'father', 'one', 'show', 'biggest', 'highlights', 'third', 'season', 'such', 'amusing', 'episodes', 'Tommy', 'Not', 'Gay', 'Shannon', 'Song', 'Grandma', 'Titus', 'Mrs.', 'Shafter', 'Protector', 'Fox', 'cancelled', 'Titus', 'can', 'once', 'again', 'experience', 'edgy', 'humor', 'DVD', 'Titus', 'Seasons', '3', 'final', '21', 'episodes', 'Titus', 'are', 'presented', 'original', 'full', 'screen', 'format', '4-Disc', 'box', 'set', 'clear', 'picture', 'quality', 'good', '2.0', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'sound', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'interviews', 'stars', 'Cynthia', 'Watros', 'Zack', 'Ward', 'Stacy', 'Keach', '25', 'minutes', 'bloopers', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'star', 'Christopher', 'Titus', 'series', 'creators', 'Brian', 'Hargrove', 'Jack', 'Kenny', 'three', 'episodes', 'Overall', 'Titus', 'Season', '3', 'obtains', 'satisfying', 'B']",N/A
946060,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000BO0KNM,Robert I. Hedges,"[13, 15]","Season three of ""Titus"" is the darkest, but the best, of the three. The show was extraordinary and daring in the exploration of taboo and politically incorrect subjects, and while it was a shame it ended after only three seasons, the entire package when seen as a whole (especially when seen in order) is perfect. While I had always been disappointed about the cancellation, the bonus interview with Zack Ward (who is much smarter than ""Dave"") had the insight about the perfect whole, and I think he is right: the show ended on a high note, and will always be looked at positively in retrospect, unlike many shows that live on past their prime.The third season deals with the darkest of all possible subjects, taken largely from Christopher Titus' own life. Most difficult is the subject of his mother's insanity and suicide, and coming to terms with the fears that it may be genetic. The episode ""Tommy's Not Gay"" is also extremely powerful (especially the black and white segments,) but for me the most difficult episode was the final episode ""The Protector"" which deals with child abuse. While I was never abused, I have seen the aftermath. It is a tragedy of the highest magnitude, and the manner in which ""Titus"" dealt with it in the final episode is both a cautionary tale to parents and other ""protectors"" and an indictment of abusers. I thought the resolution in that episode was absolutely perfect: seeing the principal finally allied for good with the ones he was charged to protect was a stunning moment of moral clarity. Heavy stuff, this, but important to see.""Titus"" is an extremely unconventional show, but a show with extreme merit.

I deal everyday with some experinces related to the show. Its somewhat of a constant battle. Enough about me. Im really glad all 3 Seasons are out. And im also glad I didnt have to wait many years either. One thing I didnt like about Fox when Titus was on they kept moving it around. It wasnt fair for the show. Then the next thing ya know there were some repeats then it was gone. Im not really happy with Fox cause Titus still should be on tv or had a much longer run then it did.
