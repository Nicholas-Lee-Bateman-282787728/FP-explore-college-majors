The typical movie about what the Nazis did to the Jews doesn't make me feel a damn thing. They're so heavy-handed that all I come away with is blunt force trauma. This one's different. A family ran like hell to Kenya or Nairobi or some damn place in Africa so isolated that it doesn't even matter what we call it. Think of all the obvious themes you can. Then stretch your imagination and come up with a few more. All are covered here, with a subtle hand, and you feel it. Powerfully. You're moved. You cringe over here and laugh over there, and in this other place you just get kinda disgusted with some people.

Since I've seen and am enthusiatic about each of those, I'd like to suggest that fans of any of those films check out 'Nowhere in Africa,' which is richly deserving of its 2002 Academy Award for best foreign language film.Pay no attention to other critiques on this page about needing to understand German, or about not being able to understand the subtleties of the dialogue because it's not in English.  That's hogwash.  The subtitles here are excellent, as is the acting, most notably by Juliane K&ouml;hler and Merab Ninidze as lead protagonists Jettel and Walter Redlich.  These are great actors who skillfully portray every nuance of their actions and feelings in a way that transcends any language barrier.My only complaint is that director Caroline Link could have been a bit more judcious about the editing process.  At 2 hours 21 minutes, the film feels about 15 minutes too long and drags at stretches.

Fairly conventional but delightful in many ways, the story of a Jewish family who had fled from Nazi Germany to Kenya is predominantly a family drama. In fact, it's one of the most memorable ""marriage films"" of recent years. Directed and written by Caroline Link, the female hand clearly shows mainly in the character of the family's father Walter (Georgia-born Merab Ninidze), who is portrayed as a very gentle, soft and considerate, while his wife Jettel (Julianne Koehler), who has problems with adapting to a whole new way of life, often toys with viewers' sympathy. The film contains numerous (clever and realistic) references about central European (not so Jewish, for that matter), African and English life and opinions, sports great music and cinematography and, simply put, is anything you may expect from an Oscar-winning film, which is an asset in itself.",4,"""Nowhere in Africa"" -- A Place to Be",1078704000,"03 8, 2004",2004,1053,"['reneissance', 'German', 'movies', 'first', 'decade', '2000', 'reached', 'one', 'peaks', 'epic', 'film', 'Out', 'Africa', 'vein', 'foreign', 'language', 'film', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', '2002', 'Fairly', 'conventional', 'delightful', 'many', 'ways', 'story', 'Jewish', 'family', 'who', 'had', 'fled', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'Kenya', 'predominantly', 'family', 'drama', 'fact', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'marriage', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'Directed', 'written', 'Caroline', 'Link', 'female', 'hand', 'clearly', 'mainly', 'character', 'family', 'father', 'Walter', 'Georgia-born', 'Merab', 'Ninidze', 'who', 'portrayed', 'very', 'gentle', 'soft', 'considerate', 'wife', 'Jettel', 'Julianne', 'Koehler', 'who', 'problems', 'adapting', 'whole', 'new', 'way', 'life', 'often', 'viewers', 'sympathy', 'film', 'numerous', 'clever', 'realistic', 'references', 'central', 'European', 'not', 'so', 'Jewish', 'matter', 'African', 'English', 'life', 'opinions', 'sports', 'great', 'music', 'cinematography', 'simply', 'put', 'anything', 'may', 'expect', 'Oscar-winning', 'film', 'asset']",N/A
768109,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B0000AUHQG,Anyechka,"[9, 9]","This film is a truly epic experience, the type of film that one doesn't see too much of anymore these days. Based on an autobiographical novel by Stefanie Zweig, it concerns the Redlich family, one of the lucky few families to leave Nazi Germany before it was too late. Walter, the father, saw the writing on the wall and left for Kenya in 1937, sending for his wife Jettel and daughter Regina six months later, in 1938. Normally one doesn't think of refugees from the Nazis as escaping to anyplace in Africa, particularly not Kenya, although there was actually a fairly substantial Jewish community in Nairobi by the time WWII broke out, along with other refugees, such as the Redlichs, living in more isolated and less-developed areas of the nation. Jettel is a bit of a Jewish German Princess at the beginning of the film, and has a very hard time adjusting to life in Kenya. She believes living on the farm in Rongai will be temporary, and was so unaware of the reality waiting for her that she brought her fine china and bought an evening gown instead of something more practical like a refrigerator before she left home. Her character proves to be the most interesting, the one who goes through the most development, becoming a very different person by the end of the film. Walter, in contrast, has a sea change in attitude in the opposite direction, and wants to return to Germany after the war instead of staying in Kenya, which has become like a home to his family and saved their lives. They also have to deal with their troubled marriage; they'd apparently begun having some problems before they left Germany, but their marriage is really put to the test in Kenya, particularly while Walter is away in the British Army for four years and Jettel is left to tend the farm. Young Regina is also a fascinating character; being so young, she adjusts quickly to life in Kenya, although, like her parents, doesn't ever really fully come to think of it as home. She has a number of different cultures to deal with--the German culture she left behind and the one she has a connection to via her parents, the native Kenyan culture and the Swahili language, and the British culture at the colonial school she attends. (Though most of this film shows us Kenya through the eyes of people living far away from so-called civilisation, this was still a time when most of Africa was under colonial rule, a much different Africa than it is today.) Her relationship with Owuor, the native who acts as a servant to her family, is incredibly moving and touching, one of the finest aspects of this film. Unlike her mother, she never has any hesitation about or resistance to befriending the natives. She doesn't care that their skin is dark and hers is light; they're just other children she has fun with and who like being with her, the same way that she instantly takes to Owuor, seeing him as a kind man who warmly welcomes her to Kenya. On the surface this is a historical film, but the true themes are about the nature of home, alienation, self-discovery, finding oneself, loss, and how sometimes the least likely place can become a refuge and come to feel almost like home over time. What is the meaning of the word home, does a refugee or immigrant ever really completely feel at home in a foreign land, and will these people ever really feel at home anywhere again, whether they remain in Kenya, return to Germany, or start a new life in an entirely new place? It's also a nice change of pace to see a WWII-era film set in Africa, to see how the war affected the native peoples, the dominating British colonialists, and the refugees like the Redlichs. The soundtrack is also incredibly gorgeous, as is the natural scenery.There are also a wealth of bonus features. The audio commentary is top-notch, revealing such interesting facts as how Walter's voice was actually done by the popular actor Herbert Knaup but for two undubbed scenes (one of which is conducted entirely in English), because it was felt that Merab Ninidze, the true actor, had too strong of a Georgian accent, and that Silas Kereti, who plays Regina's friend Jogona as a young adult, was initially very hesitant about performing in one of the tribal ceremonies in the film because it was being done by another tribe, and he thought that taking part would mean that he were becoming a member of this other tribe. Other extras are deleted scenes (with optional commentary); a making-of featurette; interviews with Merab Ninidze, Juliane K&ouml;hler (Jettel), Matthias Habich (Walter S&uuml;sskind, a character who immigrated to Kenya before the Redlichs), Sidide Onyulu (Owuor), and Caroline Link (the director), Peter Herrmann (the producer), and Stefanie Zweig; score selections; a storyboard comparison for the locust scene; trailers; and a photo montage with commentary.At almost two and a half hours long (and three hours long originally), this is a truly epic picture, a real emotional powerhouse. All of the characters are developed so well and acted so masterfully that one grows to feel as though one actually knows them, has gone on this powerful life-changing journey along with them. It's also not ""just another WWII movie,"" since the setting and themes are so very different from the usual ones. Far from just another movie, this one makes the viewer think and feel instead of just being entertaining or delivering a lot of high-tech special effects. It's a shame more films in Hollywood aren't as masterfully crafted as this wonderful highly-recommended German film.",5,An emotional powerhouse,1165795200,"12 11, 2006",2006,5543,"['film', 'truly',

The father, a lawyer, resents having to be a hired hand on English-owned Kenyan farms and ranches.  His wife hates the loss of wealth, privelege and the hardships of their new circumstances. They both miss and worry about the families left behind in Germany.  Meanwhile, their young daughter, with the flexibility and adaptability of a child, takes to the people and the land right away and becomes more African than European in her sensiblity.Played with subtlety and restraint, the emotions and conflicts generated within and without the marriage are complicated and ring true.

Her daughter, however, adapts quickly and loves the people she befriends and the experiences she has.

I particularly liked that for once an African character is central to the story, and more than just decoration.  Sure, he was ""just"" the cook, but the extent to which the family came to respect, rely, and TRUST him made him part of them.I won't describe the plot, as that has already been done by many reviewers.Having lived in Kenya, I have to say that the European actors did a fine job with the Swahili, considering they were just memorized lines.  Their delivery was natural, with the obvious caveat of the heavy accents.

I'm hoping that word of mouth will spread and that more people will get to enjoy this film on the big screen where it must be seen to enjoy the breath-taking scenery of Africa. The story is compelling and as the viewer you will be immediately drawn.  A young lawyer in prewar Nazi Germany sees the writing on the wall and gets himself out of Germany into Kenya.  He arranges for his wife and five year old daughter to join him but gives his wife strict instructions to tell no one of the plan. He also instructs his wife to leave home the good dishes and instead bring a refrigerator which they will desperately need. She ignores his instructions, brings the good dishes and to add insult to injury brings an evening gown which she will not have any use. The little girl takes to Africa immediately and adjusts as only children can in an absolutely alien environment. She befriends and is in-turn befriended by the village children. The wife does not adjust so easily making life a misery for her husband. We are also struck at how insensitive she is with the cook who is their righthand man, looking out for them at every turn. She treats him like a servant and that's putting it kindly, when this hurts him deeply as he sees himself as a professional. There are problems in the marriage and stuggles which move the story along. Not until word from home reaches them about the full magnitude of the war and what is becoming of their friends and family does the wife begin to understand how very lucky she is. At every point we are drawn to the story and the characters and want to know what will happen next. The acting is seamless.  The little girl is played by two actresses, one when she is little and one when she is more grown and these two girls couldn't be more perfect in their roles.  This movie is beautifully cast and beautifully acted. There isn't a false note in it.  Viewers will also enjoy the amazing soundtrack. One more thing, even though this movie is in English subtitles, you will hardly be aware that you are reading. At a certain point you will almost feel as if you understand German. This movie should not be missed by anyone who loves film and has a love for interesting story lines.

768119,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0000AUHQG,C. O. DeRiemer,"[3, 3]","If Jettel Redich, a sophisticated, attractive and perhaps shallow woman with a small daughter, a loving husband and a warm, extended family, had had her way in 1938 she would not have left Germany to join her husband in East Africa. Of course, if she hadn't she and her daughter, along with all her family, would have been killed in the German death camps three or four years later. Jettel (Julianne Kohl), her husband Walter (Merab Ninidze) and their daughter Regina (Lea Kurka and then, older, Karoline Eckertz) are Jews. Walter, a prosperous lawyer and judge in Germany, could see what was happening. He managed to get an exit visa, went as a Jewish refuge to Kenya, and then sent for his family. Jettel with help got exit visas, but only reluctantly. The other family members all believed their fellow Germans would come to their senses and the Hitler thing would pass. Nirgendwo in Afrika tells us what happened to Walter, Jettel and Regina. It's an absorbing story which, even in 141 minutes, tries to do too much. Even so, and even if nothing really seems deeply affecting and certainly not tragic, the Redich family and how they changed kept me watching. The movie is rambling but also often affecting.The best Walter could do was to hire on to run a failing cattle outpost. The land is dry and full of scrub. He writes to his wife asking her bring a number of practical things they will need. She, instead, brings an expensive ball gown. Their house is scarcely more than a large shack. Malaria is always a possibility. The native Kenyans look upon them as curiosities. Water has to be carried from a distant well. In the midst of all this we see three things. Walter knows that staying in Germany would have meant death for them. He's prepared to do what he must to make some sort of life where he is. Jettel is appalled by what she sees and faces. She longs for her family and for the life she had. There, she was married to a prosperous lawyer and judge. Here, she is married to a hired hand. Regina, about six years old, simply accepts everything. Soon she's playing with the native children and picking up their language. The family has a cook, a tall man named Owuor (Sidede Onyulo). Walter tries to deal with him respectfully. Jettel without thinking about it treats him as a servant. Regina as usual simply accepts him as a friend. To give you an idea of the tone of the movie, if Nirgendwo in Afrika were remade by Hollywood, the part of Owuor would undoubtedly be played by Morgan Freeman.In the course of the movie they make one good friend, a tough fellow Jew who left Germany in 1933. They are interred by the British as a possible threat when war comes in 1939, even though they are refugees from Nazi Germany. They eventually are released. Sexual dissatisfaction abounds. Walter finds employment on a better farm, he joins the British Army and is sent to Burma. Jettel learns how to run the farm and deal with the native workers. Regina grows into a unselfconscious child whose friends are all native children. She learns about being a Jew when she is sent to an English school in Nairobi where the anti-Semitism is more condescending than vicious. In a subtle way Caroline Link, the director, also lets us make our own discoveries regarding the treatment of Jews in Thirties Germany and the treatment of Africans by colonialists. By now we've seen Walter's and Jettel's marriage nearly break apart. We even experience locusts. We also see, gradually, how Walter for all his practicality yearns to return to Germany after the war. We see how Jettel has grown into a responsible, capable woman who has come to love where she is and hates the idea of returning. Regina, or course, simply has become a part of Africa and of the people she knows. Like the movie itself, the conclusion is not quite satisfying and not quite unhappy.The only serious reservation I have about the movie are the two instances of fairly explicit coupling involving Walter and Jettel. My objections have nothing to do with prudery, but with how sex is usually used to pander to the audience. In both scenes sexual intimacy is used to show us the longing and need for the kind of shared intimacy that includes but goes well beyond sexual need. The director chooses to show us so much skin, so many positions and so much perspiration that, in my view, the audience is simply encouraged to become voyeurs in the name of art. As with most dramas, the more explicit the sex we see, the more the story-line comes to a halt.Nirgendwo in Afrika won the 2003 Academy Award for best foreign language film.

Largely this is the result of the strong character development.  We see husband and wife really changed by their experience.

The fact that they can only do so by participating in colonial oppression is not lost on them.The dialogue and acting are first rate, as are the cinematography, editing, and music.

I had not heard much about this film before finally seeing it, and I was overwhelmed by its slow-moving but fascinating tale of a German Jewish family choosing to expatriate to 1930s Kenya before they ended up victims of the Nazi regime, which was growing and beginning to bear its teeth. A man, Walter, leaves his law practice and goes to Kenya and works on a ranch there, setting things up to greet his wife and daughter there. Unfortunately, his wife, Jettel, has no intention of adapting or settling in to this new way of life, not wanting to interact with the native population, refusing to assimilate to their new circumstances. Happily, the child, Regina, adapts to and enjoys their new surroundings. The scenery is stunning, and one can appreciate in viewing the film both the difficulties of adapting to this startlingly new way of life but also the excitement of being a part of something wholly different. The strains on the marriage between Walter and Jettel are clear; they no longer seem to have anything in common, if they ever did. It is only once they have learned the fate of the family members back in Germany who refused to leave that Jettel begins to realize that her life has been spared possibly only due to the fact that her husband ""saw the writing on the wall"", so to speak. Jettel's attitudes and approach to life in Kenya have slowly been transformed so that she not only falls in love with the place, she scarcely wants to return to or have anything to do with the Germany that destroyed her life as she knew it. This leads to problems during the post-war period in which Walter is eager to return to Germany to rebuild and restructure the country in a more just image. He has been offered a post as a judge, and Jettel is reluctant to return. Ultimately, this film delves deeply into human and familial relationships rather than the complexities of war and of the holocaust (which is treated more as an unseen backdrop or a ""what might have been""); it portrays a rich characterization of people who are thrown into unfamiliar territory and illustrates what they do with their new surroundings. In fact, it highlights how people change and how those changes are often nothing less than surprising.

This is an epic story about the human condition that transcends even the semibiographical time it addresses.  In short, a happy and well-to-do German family (who happen to be Jewish, mostly in name only) 'escape' to Africa in 1938 just as Hitler is beginning to unfurl his blanket of the Holocaust.  The father has proceeded the mother and daughter to find a place to live and a means of support.  He is aided (importantly) by a native cook named Owuor (the symbol of universal mankind and spirit) in creating a home away from Germany.  The basic theme of the story is how the transplanted Germans adjust to their new home, how the mother (not at all happy about giving up the good life in Germany to dwell among the natives whom she considers inferior people) attempts to inculcate her young daughter on how to stay separate from these 'dirty,untrustworthy' lower caste types.  The daughter immediately relates to the gentle Owuor and falls in love with her new life.  Matters drive husband and wife apart, they eventually are 'detained' (by the British who see them as Germans not unlike what the US did to the Japanese in WW II)in a camp which for all the world looks like a luxury hotel - without a sense of home.  The husband joins the military and eventually the family moves back to their litlle home in the wilderness, survive locusts and famine, and through many trials find each other again.  The bite to this film comes mostly from the mother's attitutde towards the Africans: it mirrors the attitude of the Nazis toward the Jews in Germany. How that bite is resolved contains some of the more sensitive movie making in  a long time.The cast is uniformly excellent:  Juliane Kohler and Merab Ninidje as the parents, Sidede Onyulo as Owuor, and the two actors who share the role of Regina the daughter - Lea Kurka and Karoline Eckertz.

This drizzly Washington morning it is now at five for it sits on our minds over breakfast coffee as richly as when we had just walked out of the theater.A young Jewish lawyer in Germany as the Nazis consolidate their evil escapes to Kenya.  As he lies recovering from malaria, nursed back to health by his African cook, his wife receives the delayed letter telling her that the Jewish society of Kenya has agreed to pay their passage to reunite the family.  Parents and sisters are left behind to a certain fate; life on an African farm proves hardscrabble at best; the daughter, scarcely five on arrival and the voice-over narrator looking back on the years, finds a true home.  The couple struggle in their marriage as much as in their efforts to survive.  That they do eventually dwell successfully on the land is, naturally, almost entirely due to the friendship and loyal labor of the rural Africans they employ.  The war ends; the Nazis are put in the dock; with each individual much changed from when he or she first arrived, does the family stay or return to post-war Germany?  All this happens under the towering African skies and in the vast bush beauty of rural Kenya.Nowhere in Africa runs well over two hours.  It might have benefitted from losing ten minutes of its running time.  Beyond that, there is nothing here to dispute -- acting is sensitive and nuanced, character development and change is thoroughly convincing, secondary characters add much to the main narrative; there are even fine bits of humor -- the cook is a cook, period, but what fun for the villagers when he does one bit of woman's work at the water hole.Nowhere in Africa, tragic in its long-distance depiction of the Holocaust, is also never less than a love story of people and place and memory.

He sent for his wife Jettel, (Juliane K&ouml;hler) and young daughter Regina, (beautifully played by both Lea Kurka, as a preschooler and Karoline Eckertz, as an adolescent), as soon as he was settled as a farm manager in Rongai, Africa. Jettel was ambivalent about leaving her mother, in-laws, prosperous life and the culture and language she loved. She had been brought up to think of herself as German first, and then as Jewish. Like many others, she did not really believe that Hitler would remain in power for long. The Redlichs seemed to have had a somewhat superficial relationship; one that had never been stressed with problems or inconveniences. Her beloved father-in-law told Jettel, before she departed, that in a marriage, ""usually one person loves more than the other."" He asked her to keep the family together.Jettel and Regina arrive to find a stark, dry land. Walter had been sick with malaria. His African cook, Owour, (Sidede Onyulo), cared for him and got him back on his feet in time for his family's arrival. He was not prepared for his wife's coldness or her aversion to the new country. Instead of bringing a refrigerator with her, as her husband had written and asked, Jettel used the money to buy an expensive gown. Also packed, in the limited amount of luggage she was allowed to remove from Germany, were fine china dishes and knickknacks. Young Regina, however, is thrilled to see her father. She immediately makes friends with Owour and takes to her new home as if she had been born there. Regina had always been a meek and frightened child, as a result of frequent harassment in Germany. Her fears leave her quickly in this sun-filled country where she begins to run wild with the native children and learn a new culture and language. The conflict between her parents continues to grow. Jettel does not see the big picture. Rather than be thankful that her family was one of the very few able to escape Germany, she is resentful of their shabby life and seems to loose respect for Walter now that he is no longer a lawyer. She makes it very clear that she is unhappy.Photographer Gernot Roll captures the beauty of the land, with its sweeping savannas, the sacred Mt. Kenya overlooking the small homestead, shots of African ceremonies and dances, children playing, and wonderful close-ups of a hoard of locustsattacking crops of corn.The terrible stress of losing one's culture, of always being different, is what is emphasized most by director Caroline Link. As Jettel says to her daughter, ""Germany is a place where differences are bad, in Africa differences are good. I learned here how valuable differences are.""The movie is somewhat flawed. I think that Regina would have made a much better main character than her mother. It is difficult to like Jettel, as the spoiled, selfish daughter/wife/mother who refuses to adapt. And there is little chemistry between husband and wife, although they make an extraordinarily attractive couple. Overall, however, ""Nowhere In Africa"" definitely deserves 4 stars. It won various awards in Germany and was that country's Oscar nomination in 2002.JANA",4,A Film About The Value Of Differences - Excellent!,1072483200,"12 27, 2003",2003,3639,"['Nowhere', 'Africa', 'young', 'assimilated', 'German-Jewish', 'family', 'time', 'flee', 'Nazi', 'Germany', '1938', 'emigrate', 'Africa', 'end', 'WWII', 'moving', 'film', 'adapted', 'Stefanie', 'Zweig', 'autobiographical', 'novel', 'deals', 'more', 'struggle', 'begin', 'new', 'life', 'very', 'foreign', 'land', 'war', 'going', 'back', 'Europe.Walter', 'Redlich', 'Merab', 'Ninidze', 'lawyer', 'living', 'Breslau', 'Germany', 'sensed', 'dark', 'future', 'Jews', 'Third', 'Reich', 'left', 'find', 'work', 'Kenya', '1938', 'sent', 'wife', 'Jettel', 'Juliane', 'K', 'ouml', 'hler', 'young', 'daughter', 'Regina', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Lea', 'Kurka', 'preschooler', 'Karoline', 'Eckertz', 'adolescent', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'settled', 'farm', 'manager', 'Rongai', 'Africa', 'Jettel', 'was', 'ambivalent', 'leaving', 'mother', 'in-laws', 'prosperous', 'life', 'culture', 'language', 'loved', 'had', 'been', 'brought', 'up', 'think', 'German', 'first', 'then', 'Jewish', 'many', 'others', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'believe', 'Hitler', 'would', 'remain', 'power', 'long', 'Redlichs', 'seemed', 'have', 'had', 'somewhat', 'superficial', 'relationship', 'one', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'stressed', 'problems', 'inconveniences', 'beloved', 'father-in-law', 'told', 'Jettel', 'departed', 'marriage', 'usually', 'one', 'person', 'more', 'other', 'asked', 'keep', 'family', 'together.Jettel', 'Regina', 'arrive', 'find', 'stark', 'dry', 'land', 'Walter', 'had', 'been', 'sick', 'malaria', 'African', 'cook', 'Owour', 'Sidede', 'Onyulo', 'cared', 'got', 'back', 'feet', 'time', 'family', 'arrival', 'was', 'not', 'prepared', 'wife', 'coldness', 'aversion', 'new', 'country', 'Instead', 'bringing', 'refrigerator', 'husband', 'had', 'written', 'asked', 'Jettel', 'used', 'money', 'buy', 'expensive', 'gown', 'Also', 'packed', 'limited', 'amount', 'luggage', 'was', 'allowed', 'remove', 'Germany', 'were', 'fine', 'china', 'dishes', 'knickknacks', 'Young', 'Regina', 'however', 'thrilled', 'see', 'father', 'immediately', 'friends', 'Owour', 'new', 'home', 'had', 'been', 'born', 'there', 'Regina', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'meek', 'frightened', 'child', 'result', 'frequent', 'harassment', 'Germany', 'fears', 'leave', 'quickly', 'sun-filled', 'country', 'where', 'run', 'wild', 'native', 'children', 'learn', 'new', 'culture', 'language', 'conflict', 'parents', 'grow', 'Jettel', 'not', 'see', 'big', 'picture', 'Rather', 'be', 'thankful', 'family', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'able', 'escape', 'Germany', 'resentful', 'shabby', 'life', 'loose', 'respect', 'Walter', 'now', 'no', 'longer', 'lawyer', 'very', 'clear', 'unhappy.Photographer', 'Gernot', 'Roll', 'beauty', 'land', 'sweeping', 'savannas', 'sacred', 'Mt', 'Kenya', 'overlooking', 'small', 'homestead', 'shots', 'African', 'ceremonies', 'dances', 'children', 'playing', 'wonderful', 'close-ups', 'hoard', 'locustsattacking', 'crops', 'corn.The', 'terrible', 'stress', 'losing', 'one', 'culture', 'always', 'being', 'different', 'what', 'emphasized', 'most', 'director', 'Caroline', 'Link', 'Jettel', 'daughter', 'Germany', 'place', 'where', 'differences', 'are', 'bad', 'Africa', 'differences', 'are', 'good', 'learned', 'here', 'how', 'valuable', 'differences', 'are', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'flawed', 'think', 'Regina', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'main', 'character', 'mother', 'difficult', 'like', 'Jettel', 'spoiled', 'selfish', 'daughter/wife/mother', 'who', 'adapt', 'little', 'chemistry', 'husband', 'wife', 'make', 'extraordinarily', 'attractive', 'couple', 'Overall', 'however', 'Nowhere', 'Africa', 'definitely', '4', 'stars', 'won', 'various', 'awards', 'Germany', 'was', 'country', 'Oscar', 'nomination', '2002.JANA']",N/A

768138,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B0000AUHQG,Joseph Haschka,"[1, 1]","Simply put, NOWHERE IN AFRICA is a beautiful, beguiling film that explores the essence of what is &quot;home&quot;.The film begins in the snows of Germany in 1938. Jettel Redlich (Juliane Kohler) and her 4-year old daughter are out for a day of sledding. Amidst the frolic, each is rudely knocked to the ground by anonymous fellow citizens. The Redlichs, you see, are Jews in Hitler's Third Reich.Having suspected the direction that National Socialist anti-Semitism will take, Jettel's husband, Walter (Merab Ninidze), had previously given up his law practice and gone to Kenya to prepare ground for the family's emigration. He's gotten work as the range manager on a drought-plagued cattle farm. Despite the hardships, Walter writes to Jettel to come immediately with Regina and bring only the essentials and/or whatever the Nazis will allow them to carry. So, several months before Kristalnacht, mother and daughter take ship from Europe, leaving both sets of grandparents behind to their wartime fates.Depicting a span of nine years and &quot;told&quot; through Regina's eyes, NOWHERE IN AFRICA examines the response of each Redlich to immersion in a vastly different physical environment and culture. Walter, the realist, embraces his new circumstances as the key to survival, even as his fortunes change multiple times over the course of the film. Jettel, arriving in Kenya a pampered, upper-middle class wife, learns the hard way.  She's initially horrified by the heat, dust, dryness, monotonous diet, local customs, lack of genteel amenities, and the necessity of having to interact with native Blacks. Regina (Lea Kurka and Karoline Eckertz) copes the best of all, beginning with her immediate attachment to the family's congenial native cook, Owour, marvelously played by Sidede Onyulo. Of the three, the daughter becomes the most Africanized.After nine years, after having endured a roller coaster of experiences and a sometimes troubled marriage, Walter and Jettel must decide whether or not to return themselves and Regina to a defeated and devastated homeland. Do they owe anything to the country that rejected them and liquidated their relatives?Every aspect of NOWHERE IN AFRICA can be described by a superlative. It's a sedately paced love affair with Africa in all of its seductiveness. Even locusts play a part. In the very last scene, perhaps Jettel and the viewer realize that &quot;going home again&quot; may not be an option when the realm of the heart has shifted forever.",5,A beautiful film,1070928000,"12 9, 2003",2003,2496,"['Simply', 'put', 'NOWHERE', 'IN', 'AFRICA', 'beautiful', 'beguiling', 'film', 'essence', 'what', 'quot', 'home', 'quot', '.The', 'film', 'snows', 'Germany', '1938', 'Jettel', 'Redlich', 'Juliane', 'Kohler', '4-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'are', 'out', 'day', 'sledding', 'Amidst', 'frolic', 'rudely', 'knocked', 'ground', 'anonymous', 'fellow', 'citizens', 'Redlichs', 'see', 'are', 'Jews', 'Hitler', 'Third', 'Reich.Having', 'suspected', 'direction', 'National', 'Socialist', 'anti-Semitism', 'will', 'take', 'Jettel', 'husband', 'Walter', 'Merab', 'Ninidze', 'had', 'previously', 'given', 'up', 'law', 'practice', 'gone', 'Kenya', 'prepare', 'ground', 'family', 'emigration', 'gotten', 'work', 'range', 'manager', 'drought-plagued', 'cattle', 'farm', 'hardships', 'Walter', 'Jettel', 'come', 'immediately', 'Regina', 'bring', 'only', 'essentials', 'and/or', 'Nazis', 'will', 'allow', 'carry', 'So', 'several', 'months', 'Kristalnacht', 'mother', 'daughter', 'take', 'ship', 'Europe', 'leaving', 'sets', 'grandparents', 'wartime', 'fates.Depicting', 'span', 'nine', 'years', 'quot', 'told', 'quot', 'Regina', 'eyes', 'NOWHERE', 'IN', 'AFRICA', 'response', 'Redlich', 'immersion', 'vastly', 'different', 'physical', 'environment', 'culture', 'Walter', 'realist', 'new', 'circumstances', 'key', 'survival', 'even', 'fortunes', 'change', 'multiple', 'times', 'course', 'film', 'Jettel', 'arriving', 'Kenya', 'pampered', 'upper-middle', 'class', 'wife', 'hard', 'way', 'initially', 'horrified', 'heat', 'dust', 'dryness', 'monotonous', 'diet', 'local', 'customs', 'lack', 'genteel', 'amenities', 'necessity', 'having', 'interact', 'native', 'Blacks', 'Regina', 'Lea', 'Kurka', 'Karoline', 'Eckertz', 'best', 'beginning', 'immediate', 'attachment', 'family', 'congenial', 'native', 'cook', 'Owour', 'marvelously', 'played', 'Sidede', 'Onyulo', 'three', 'daughter', 'most', 'Africanized.After', 'nine', 'years', 'having', 'endured', 'roller', 'coaster', 'experiences', 'sometimes', 'troubled', 'marriage', 'Walter', 'Jettel', 'must', 'decide', 'not', 'return', 'Regina', 'defeated', 'devastated', 'homeland', 'Do', 'owe', 'anything', 'country', 'rejected', 'liquidated', 'relatives', 'aspect', 'NOWHERE', 'IN', 'AFRICA', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'superlative', 'sedately', 'paced', 'affair', 'Africa', 'seductiveness', 'Even', 'play', 'part', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'perhaps', 'Jettel', 'viewer', 'realize', 'quot', 'going', 'home', 'again', 'quot', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'option', 'when', 'realm', 'heart', 'shifted', 'forever']",N/A

The story is relatively straightforward - a Jewish family moves to Africa to avoid the coming war. What isn't straigtforward is the complexity of the characters and their growth in spirit as they adapt to the changes in their lives.The husband/father is compasionate and caring, not just to his family but to the Africans and others who help him. The wife/mother begins as a very spoiled, elitist who is forced to re-evaluate herself, her relationship with her husband, the people and country of Africa. The daughter grows in both body and spirit, adjusting almost too well to the new situation. Of the 3, she is the most grounded in reality and is wise beyond her years.The focus of the film is not the war itself but it's impact on this family.

Based upon an autobiographical book by Stefanie Zweig, the film is beautifully acted by a stellar cast and deftly directed by Caroline Link. It is a film that will stay in one's consciousness long after the credits have rolled by. It is also a film that touches upon a number of universal themes.The film focuses on an upper class, privileged family of secular German Jews. The husband, Walter Redlich (Merab Ninidze), seeing the way things are going in Germany in the 1930s with the advent of Hitler, leaves his law practice and emigrates to Africa, where he finds himself managing a ranch for an Englishman in an arid location in rural Kenya, while setting the stage for his family's emigration from Germany. In 1938, he then sends for his beautiful, haughty wife, Jettel (Juliane Kohler), and young daughter, Regina (Lea Gurka as a young child and Karoline Eckertz as an adolescent), to join him.When they arrive, the wife goes into culture shock and is in total denial as to their new circumstances. Her reaction to their precarious situation is different from that of her husband, as well as from that of her child. Her husband, a realist about the situation in Germany and a survivor at heart, knows that they cannot return while Hitler is in power and is willing to make the best of the hand that they have been dealt. Jettel, however, still fails to understand just how precarious their situation in Germany was.Once removed from a familiar environment, Walter and Jettel seem to have very little in common. Now that her husband is no longer a practicing lawyer, Jettel acts as if he has been diminished in her eyes. She also initially disdains her new, hardscrabble life and hates all things African, even the natives, treating them like dirt, until her husband insinuates that she is starting to remind him of the Nazis.Their household is made complete by a very pleasant and affable Kenyan named Owour (Sidele Onyulo), who had saved Walter's life during a bout with malaria and who acts as the family cook. He helps them in enumerable ways, teaching them the language and customs of his people. Regina immediately bonds with Owour and adapts quickly to her new life and customs. She befriends the native children, learns their language, and prefers Kenya over Germany as her country of choice, notwithstanding its hardships and privations. In her nine years in Kenya, Regina, despite attending a British school, becomes as African in her ways as a native.The conflicts of war soon make themselves manifest in Kenya, which is under English rule. The threads of Walter's and Jettel's marriage start to fray and unravel, as their hopes and dreams come into conflict. They are, however, always unified in terms of their love of Regina, an extraordinarily perceptive and intelligent child. Still, Walter and Jettel must endure and weather some pretty serious marital storms, as the self-absorbed Jettel slowly undergoes a metamorphosis, which throws her strained marriage into a tailspin for a time.As Jettel learns to adapt to her changing circumstances and accept some of the changes in her life, the marriage begins to stabilize despite its continual strains and cracks. Upon discovering the fate of their respective families, who had refused to emigrate despite Walter's early entreaties, Jettel now realizes what her fate might have been had her husband not had the foresight to seek an alternative solution. It is then that reality finally sets in. Consequently, when the war is over, she initially refuses to have anything to do with a post-war Germany, while her husband hankers to return so as to be a part of its re-building. What ultimately happens, however, will be the true test of their love.This is a fully character driven film, played against the largely unseen backdrop of the holocaust. Merab Ninidze is brilliant as the beleaguered Walter. Handsome, sensitive, and intelligent, he is an absolute dream in the role, bringing an astuteness and underlying strength to the role that makes him stand out from the crowd. He walks a fine line but manages to avoid being pitied for the way his wife treats him. The beautiful Juliane Kohler is excellent as the selfish Jettel, managing to interject, at the last, a certain vulnerability into what is essentially a nearly unlikable character. Sidele Onyulo is wonderful as the warm and always helpful Owour, infusing the role with an infectious charm. Lea Gurka and Karoline Eckertz are both ingratiating as the younger and older manifestations of Regina, the child through whose eyes most of the events in the film are seen.Beautifully rendered, from its casting, to the acting, to its sensitive direction, and last, but certainly not least, its exquisite cinematography, it is a must see, engrossing film that will keep the viewer riveted to the screen.

768142,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B0000AUHQG,Linda Linguvic,"[4, 5]","This is the story of a Jewish family fleeing Nazi Germany in the 1930s.  They go to Kenya, a place as foreign to them as another world.  However, at least they are safe.  The father, played by Merab Ninidze, was a former lawyer.  Now he runs a farm in a rather desolate area.  He suffers from Malaria and is nursed to health by an African cook, played by Sidede Onyulo who teaches him to speak Swahili.  When the Jewish man's wife and daughter arrive, there is a lot of adjusting to do, especially for the wife, played by Juliane Kohler, who spends her last money before the trip on a ball gown.  The little girl, who is about 6, is played by Lea Kurka.  She's the first one to adjust and easily makes friends with the village children.That's just the outline of the story however, which is told against the backdrop of historical events.  When war is declared, the family is now considered German by the English authorities ruling Kenya and put in a rather luxurious detention for a while.  The marriage is troubled, the daughter is sent to an English school.  The family learns what it is to be different.  And yet, they grow to love their new home.  There are serious questions to decide when the war ends.I found this film fascinating, especially in the parts where there were culture clashes. It was filmed in German, with a bit of Swahili and English.  This added to its authenticity.  I don't know if this was a true story or not, but it sure seemed real to me.

768143,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B0000AUHQG,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[3, 15]","Nowhere in Africa tells a unique story about the Jewish Holocaust. What makes if different from other films of that genre is that the family flees to Africa and discovers new cultures and traditions, which would make for fascinating storytelling. Unfortunately, not much goes on in this film, and it quickly becomes repetitive, tedious, and boring.Abandoning their once-comfortable existence in Germany, Walter Redlich, his wife Jettel (Juliane Kohler) and their five-year-old daughter Regina each deal with the harsh realities of their new life in different ways. Attorney Walter is resigned to working the farm as a caretaker; pampered Jettel resists adjustment at every turn; while the shy yet curious Regina immediately embraces the country-learning the local language and customs, and finding a friend in Owuor, the farm's cook. As the war rages on the other side of the world, the trio's relationships to their strange environment become increasingly complicated as Jettel grows more self-assured and Walter more haunted by the life they left behind. As they eventually learn to cherish their life in Africa, they also endeavor to find a way back to each other.That the movie focuses mainly on the characters rather than the war gives this story its strength. Kurka and Eckertz both give skillful performances as Regina in her respective stages of adolescence. The character comes off as being not only blissfully innocent but fiercely intelligent. When the Pokot children teach her how to warm her feet in cow dung, or when she gathers everyone around for a story about angels, you can't help but wonder whether the tribe still talks about Stefanie Zweig so many years later. Likewise, when she debates with her tribal boyfriend about whether she should remove her blouse in order to more freely climb a tree (the way any Pokot teenager might do), we're presented with a clever example of culture clash.Unfortunately, a handful of problems with the directing and editing keep Nowhere in Africa from reaching its full potential. By far, the most serious issue is the way that Link positions Jettel as the main character, rather than Regina. The former is almost wholly unlovable and therefore audience members are likely to have little sympathy for her woes. From the start, she jeopardizes her family's welfare by pointedly deciding not to bring a refrigerator to Kenya, as her husband has requested. We soon learn that she has instead packed their shipping crates with fine china and spent the money on a fancy dress that she's never worn. Perhaps this would be forgivable if there were additional scenes to help us understand her torment; but as it is, Jettel seems more spoiled than anything else.The second major problem-which also centers on Jettel-is that Link wants badly to create a love story out of Jettel and Walter's unstable relationship. While we're supposed to believe that the harshness of life in the Kenyan desert pulls the two apart (and then brings them back together again), it's difficult to see how they were ever really in love to begin with. In one of the first scenes, when Jettel's father-in-law says to her, ""One of you always loves the most,"" it's clear that the relationship is already out of balance. And sure enough, we see Jettel flirt with a neighborly expatriate and then shamelessly start up an affair with a handsome-but-manipulative British officer. Because this infidelity comes so easily to Jettel, one presumes that the cracks in her marriage are her own fault-not the desert's.With the wonderful Talk to Her, it's a shame this won Best Foreign Film. While it had so much going for it, I quickly lost interest, and became bored. And at almost 2 and a half hours, it was WAY too long. A good film is supposed to linger in your mind for days.

768144,A319KYEIAZ3SON,B0000AUHQG,Mary Whipple,"[5, 5]","Establishing cultural contrasts in the opening scenes--German children playing in snow alternating with scenes of an African riding a bicycle through the dry, hot plains--director Caroline Link creates a sensitive portrait of the Redlich family, German Jews who acknowledge the rising anti-Semitism in Breslau in 1938 and abandon Germany for Africa.  Walter Redlich (Merab Ninidze), his wife Jettel (Juliane Kohler), and young daughter Regina (Lea Kurka), forced to leave their extended family behind, relocate to a remote, subsistence level farm in Kenya.Regina, like all children, quickly becomes fascinated by her new life and the cultures she discovers.  Walter, now working as a farm manager instead of as a lawyer, and spoiled Jettel, who has brought along her Rosenthal china instead of a refrigerator, face more immediate difficulties acclimating to the culture and their changed circumstances.Director Link places the emphasis here on the impossibility of the family's ""fitting in"" because of the differences in language, race, education, religion, and former lifestyle.  Their African cook Owuor (elegantly played by Sidede Onyulo), however, helps them adjust to their new lives, and a warm relationship evolves between them, especially with young Regina.  When war breaks out, Walter is interned by the British, later joining Operation J, a group of Jews Against Hitler.  Jettel must recognize the realities of life, adapting to what is, rather than what used to be.Link focuses on Africa, not the Holocaust, revealing what is happening in Europe through letters, not through direct scenes.  Merab Ninidze plays a realistic Walter, agonizing over the fate of his family in Germany and impatient with Jettel's spoiled petulance in Africa.  Juliane Kohler movingly portrays Jettel's transformation from protected wife to a woman with goals, totally committed to making the farm work and freed from the social restrictions in Germany.  Lea Kurka, outstanding as the young Regina, has the enthusiasm of youth, an unrestrained love for Owuor and the African children she meets, and the ability to accept being an outsider at the British school she attends, resented because of her academic success and German roots.  Eventually, the family must decide where, if anyplace, they really ""belong"" and whether to accept repatriation.The cinematography by Gernot Roll emphasizes the harsh reality of life and its day-to-day tedium, not the romantic sunrise-on-the-Serengeti shots of many other African films.  Academy Award winner in 2002 for Best Foreign Film, the film emphasizes real life, real hardships, and real cultural differences, stressing the innate belief that humans, no matter how tolerant of other cultures, function most effectively and most happily within a shared heritage.

768145,A2B6VI9MQI0WKI,B0000AUHQG,Matthew Gladney,"[7, 8]","The year is 1938. Walter Redlich, a Jewish lawyer, has been living in Africa for six months. He moved there from Germany, all too aware of what the rise of the Nazis meant for he and his family. In Africa, he works as a simple farmhand near Nairobi. At the start of the film, we see him writing to his wife, Jettel. He is sending the money she and their daughter, Regina, will need to board a ship and head to Africa. He tells Jettel that it doesn't matter how long it takes the boat to reach Africa, as long as it takes them. He knows that the worst is yet to come for their country.Suffice it to say, Walter's wife and daughter make it to Africa, but to divulge anything more about ""Nowhere In Africa"" would be to take away from it, for much of the enjoyment derived from it is not knowing what will happen next. This is a movie that captures your interest and doesn't let go, even at the end. As the credits were rolling, I found myself wondering what would happen to the characters next. That is the sign of a great motion picture.Concerning the characters, it is one of the film's strengths that the people in it, while not completely likable at all times, are definitely interesting and textured. There is a depth to these characters. They act in ways that are complex, sometimes unpredictable. This isn't a connect-the-dots type of movie. It is an interesting, thought-provoking picture. One of my favorite characters was Owuor. He is an African, and is only supposed to be the Redlich's cook, but he becomes much, much more. He is trustworthy, wise, and devoted to the family. Quite a touching character.Kudos are in order for Gernot Roll, the cinematographer. Director Caroline Link has given us some spectacular views of Africa, and Roll brings out every vivid ounce of beauty that the locations have to offer. It truly seems like someplace special, even though the conditions are far below 'modern' standards. The musical score, by Niki Reiser and Jochen Schmidt-Hambrock is quite moving. It is used sparingly, but to great effect. I especially liked Owuor's theme.There is much to praise about ""Nowhere In Africa"", and very little to quibble over. It is over 2 hours long, but for the most part doesn't feel padded or extended in any way. The time in Africa seems idealized somewhat, but perhaps that is because we know what is happening in the Redlich's homeland, and the fate that could have befallen them there. As Walter says at one point, ""We're alive.""  And really, that is the most important thing. There is also a message included about tolerance. The Redlichs experience intolerance toward them in Germany because they were Jewish, and yet Jettel shows disdain for the Africans when she first arrives on their continent. Walter is quick to point out her failings in that area.The people and events in ""Nowhere In Africa"" have lingered with me since I saw it a week ago.

768146,A152C8GYY25HAH,B0000AUHQG,Matthew Horner,"[56, 58]","""Nowhere in Africa"" is a complex but satisfying drama about a Jewish German family that escaped the Nazi Holocaust by moving to Kenya. It is a true story. This beautifully told and photographed movie suffers only slightly by running a bit too long.The small family is comprised of the father, Walter Redlich [Merab Ninidze], the mother, Jettel [Juliane Kohler], and a young daughter, Regina [Lea Kurka]. They are well established, middle-class Jews who are content to call Germany home. They are not particularly orthodox in their religious belief and consider themselves `normal' German citizens. After the Nazis come to power and begin their repressive programs, Walter, a man more farsighted than most, begins to see the real dangers this regime poses. In 1938 he takes his wife and daughter to live in Kenya where he works on a vast farm that is almost literally in the middle of nowhere. Regina quickly adapts to her new home, but Jettel, unable to accept the horrible reality of what is happening back home, is miserable. Several years later, the war ends, and the Nazis are no more. Then, however, it is Jettel who has come to love Africa and Walter who yearns to return home. Essentially, this is a love story about two very different people who learn that acceptance and compromise are necessary parts of any strong relationship.There is a dynamic subtext to this movie: A family which is considered alien by most of the population in its native Germany is thrown into an environment where the population is even more alien to them. By learning to accept - and eventually to love - the Kenyans and their exotic ways, the family becomes stronger and more universal.""Nowhere is Africa"" is a mature film for a mature audience.

It was not only almost impossible to leave Germany but also to find a country willing to receive the &eacute;migr&eacute;s. If nations at that period had been less restrictive to Jewish emigration, perhaps tragedy could be mitigated.Jettel is suddenly immersed in a different universe. Different people, different climate, different social position, different...everything!As soon as she is starting to adapt, a new major change occurs: WWII explode and her family is considered as enemy by British authorities.Again turmoil, changes and resettlement, Regina is growing up and she is increasingly assuming the key position of being the cultural bridge for her family.There are several high points in this film.Cinematography directed by veteran Gernot Roll (a TV film specialist) shows Kenyan environment with lucid images.Playacting is just great. Julianne K&ouml;hler as Jettel shows the difficult metamorphosis from a pampered High-class young woman into a hardened farmer. She will again show her actress proficiency as Eva Braun in ""The Downfall"" (2004).The two girl-actresses that impersonate Regina, Lea Kurka, the younger and Karoline Eckertz the elder, give a fresh and natural version of a European girl discovering Africa.Last but not least Sidede Onyulo fleshes with deep tenderness Owuor the cooker first and then overseer, butler and confident.It is a great movie not to let it pass by unnoticed!Reviewed by Max Yofre.",5,Far from maddening Germany!,1137369600,"01 16, 2006",2006,2084,"['Nowhere', 'Africa', '2001', 'new', 'approach', 'Holocaust', 'tragedy', 'done', 'now', 'German', 'film', 'director', 'Caroline', 'Link.This', 'film', 'deservedly', 'earned', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'Oscar', '2003', 'many', 'other', 'international', 'awards.What', 'new', 'Jewish', 'family', 'destiny', 'far', 'Germany', 'yet', 'deeply', 'affected', 'political', 'circumstances.This', 'film', 'briefly', 'describing', 'situation', 'well-to-do', 'family', 'residing', 'increasingly', 'hostile', 'restrictive', 'environment.Jettel', 'daughter', 'Regina', 'are', 'recalled', 'Kenya', 'Walter', 'husband', 'who', 'already', 'living', 'there', 'year', 'before.Here', 'first', 'sore', 'spot', 'be', 'disclosed', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'almost', 'impossible', 'leave', 'Germany', 'also', 'find', 'country', 'willing', 'receive', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'nations', 'period', 'had', 'been', 'less', 'restrictive', 'Jewish', 'emigration', 'perhaps', 'tragedy', 'could', 'be', 'mitigated.Jettel', 'suddenly', 'immersed', 'different', 'universe', 'Different', 'people', 'different', 'climate', 'different', 'social', 'position', 'different', 'everything', 'As', 'soon', 'starting', 'adapt', 'new', 'major', 'change', 'WWII', 'explode', 'family', 'considered', 'enemy', 'British', 'authorities.Again', 'turmoil', 'changes', 'resettlement', 'Regina', 'growing', 'up', 'increasingly', 'assuming', 'key', 'position', 'being', 'cultural', 'bridge', 'are', 'several', 'high', 'points', 'film.Cinematography', 'directed', 'veteran', 'Gernot', 'Roll', 'TV', 'film', 'specialist', 'Kenyan', 'environment', 'lucid', 'images.Playacting', 'just', 'great', 'Julianne', 'K', 'ouml', 'Jettel', 'difficult', 'metamorphosis', 'pampered', 'High-class', 'young', 'woman', 'hardened', 'farmer', 'will', 'again', 'show', 'actress', 'proficiency', 'Eva', 'Braun', 'Downfall', '2004', '.The', 'two', 'girl-actresses', 'impersonate', 'Regina', 'Lea', 'Kurka', 'younger', 'Karoline', 'Eckertz', 'elder', 'give', 'fresh', 'natural', 'version', 'European', 'girl', 'discovering', 'Africa.Last', 'not', 'least', 'Sidede', 'Onyulo', 'deep', 'tenderness', 'Owuor', 'cooker', 'first', 'then', 'overseer', 'butler', 'confident.It', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'let', 'pass', 'unnoticed', 'Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",N/A

Burns,"[3, 4]","Most movies about the Holocaust, however specifically or obstensibly, usually take place in Germany and have much shouting in German and moping in Yiddish. It was a nice change, then, to see a movie about 'the ones that got away,' German Jews who actually escaped the hand of the Nazis and lived and worked far away. Nowhere in Africa, a recent winner for Best Foreign Film, is the story of the Redlich family, who raise their young girl on the plains of Africa while WWII blasts away in their homeland. For most of the movie, it's an enjoyable little slice-of-life about clashing cultures and that underlying theme of the family's tragedies overseas. Link's nimble camera captures the country's harsh beauty, and narration from the young daughter (in her older years) is warm and subtle. The drama within the family (unfaithfulness and the like) wears a little thin after a while, and the movie could have used a little more work in the editing room. Nowhere in Africa doesn't exactly escape the trappings of its genre, but it provides some nice scenery chewing and some moments of stark beauty that make it worth a rental.

Crammer,"[5, 10]","It has an epic scope and deals with serious issues -- how one group exploits and oppresses another.Set in the period before, during, and after World War II, this movie tells the story of a an upper middle class Jewish family fortunate enough to get out of Germany in time.  They end up starting from scratch in Kenya, where life for them is very different and very difficult.  The family members (a father joined by his wife and young daughter) have varying degrees of difficulty in adopting to this new country and relating to the Africans who work the farms they are managing.  The father -- a lawyer in Germany -- respects the Kenyan staff and immediately sets about learning the language.  The mother has a more difficult time adjusting and wants the Kenyan cook (on whom they are deeply dependant) to speak German and resists learning the language.  The young daughter quickly becomes assimilated, since her playmates in the isolated farm are Kenyans.  As they struggle to survive and adjust, news reaches them from time to time about what's happening to the Jews in Germany (including their family).My only criticism is that this film could have been edited to make it more suitable for family viewing -- older children and teenagers -- which it isn't, in my opinion.  You really couldn't show it in a high school, for example, although the content on the whole would be terrific for a conversation on a number of important topics, including cultural differences.But -- there are a couple of scenes of animals being slaughtered (and people eating VERY fresh meat) that turned my stomach, as well as some very explicit sex scenes.  BOth of these kinds of scenes were really gratuitous to what the movie was intending to say, in my opinion.

But, c'mon, the class started at 8 a.m.!This Holocaust story is very different than most you will read or view, a story of survival from a great distance. It is a story of how one German Jewish family escaped Hitler's death machine through the foresight of the husband. In the late 1930s, while he is a prosperous lawyer and his family comfortable in their upper middle class circles, he moves his wife and daughter to Africa, where he has secured a job as a farmhand.Each of the family members must adjust to their new life, and the tensions of the story arise from their differing ability to adapt. Can the marriage survive all the upheaval and grief? Even to the end, when they must make the difficult decision of whether to stay or return to Germany at the close of World War II, you really can't say whether they will stay together.The story is one of respect, how people from one culture come to respect an entirely different culture. And, as Walter and Jettel's marriage falters, their lack of respect for each other is explored. Jettel cannot respect her husband as a lowly farmhand, and Walter cannot respect his wife's deep loneliness and need for comfort and security. Their daughter Regina is young enough not to struggle with these issues, and it is she who most successfully adapts. But in the end, even she admits that she is happier at her boarding school than at her remote farm, a signal that she might be ready to return to a society in which she can thrive as she grows into womanhood.My other wish is that I had a big-screen TV. The scenery is beautiful. But there are a few scenes I wouldn't want to see as large as life, the scenes that grant this movie its R rating. They are totally unnecessary, added purely for prurient reasons, and nothing that the story itself needs. I'd have granted five stars if the director had shown a little more restraint.

The second time I watched it, I felt more at home with the characters, and I found that I could involve myself more fully with each of them than I could at the initial viewing. Yet this film, beautiful as it is, is more a narrative string, a series of scenes, than a drama. It's not that there is a shortage of drama in the idea - or ideas, for there are many - it is just that the drama is not concentrated on any of the various storylines that keep tantalizing us. They tantalize but are never realized, at least not to the full extent they could have been. The director should have taken one or two of the themes she has here and delved into them much more thoroughly. What we have are a number of interesting sketches but never a full canvas. That does not mean that the movie is without its moments (the brilliant young German daughter speaking with the British school headmaster was one such moment, wonderful), but as a viewer I kept wanting more out of each relationship, both between the humans, and between the humans and the place itself. Too much of the film is a kind of mystery without any solution. The shorthand the director uses to tell us her story feels more like an outline for a movie than a real movie. It's a beautiful trailer that goes on for 140 minutes: time aplenty to have told us a really great story. Nonetheless, I do recommend this film.

Walter, Jettel, and their young daughter Regina travel to Nairobi in the early thirties.  Walter, a former judge, is forced to take a job as a farm laborer working for a British landowner. At this time during the Third Reich, all Jews were unable to work at their professions.  Jettel, used to a more glamorous life of dinner parties, nice clothes, and servants, is forced to live in a country where there is a shortage of not only these things, but simple elements, like water.  As the war progresses, this family is now considered the enemy, and for a time Walter is incarcerated in a British prison camp. Their luck changes due to intervention by a British officer who is more than an admirer of the lovely Jettel!  Walter becomes the manager of a farm of the landowner who is involved in the war.  The member of the family who quickly picks up the language and culture of the natives is Regina.  Eventually the family grows to love the people and the country but another wrench is thrown into the whole picture, and it is the ending of the war. Does the family go back to a country that once rejected them and is now in ruins?  Or should they stay and make a new life in a place that also has a lot of unknowns?  I think that all of the actors played their roles very well, including the native actors who spoke in their own language.

They live and work on a farm in a dry region, and the father is paid to be the manager. The wife has many reservations about the farm and wants to move to the city. Their daughter loves Africa and befriends all of the local natives.Jettel, the mother is played by Juliane Kohler and Regina Redlica is played by Lea Kurka. They travel from Germany to escape the Nazi regime. Jettel loves elegance and brings lace tablecloths and china and forgets the refrigerator at home.  Walter, played by Merab Ninidze, is exasperated because he wants what is best for his family.  The marriage is in trouble, because both Jettel and Walter have differing goals. Walter wants to succeed in Kenya, Jettel wants to leave. They both live for the letters from home that come irregularly. The star of the film is Owuor played by Sidede Onyulo, he is the native cook and comes to love the entire family. Regina loves him immediately. She learns a great deal about Kenyan life from him. At one point, they are all rounded up by the British as enemy aliens. But they are taken to quite luxurious accommodations and cared for well.To the Africans, they are simply white farmers. Regina, finds her first taste of anti-Semitism when she attends t a boarding school.  As time passes Jettel begins to feel more at home. Jettel grows to like Africa as the father likes it less, and their daughter loves it always. The story is told through the eyes of the daughter.This is a lovely story of a family in trouble, the Nazi regime is discussed and shown, and the love that binds the family in a remote section of Kenya. The characters are so well drawn, and we come to care about them.

768157,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0000AUHQG,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 4]","Nirgendwo in Afrika (Caroline Link, 2001)Winner of the Best Foreign Film Oscar in America and five German Film Awards in its native country, Nowhere in Africa begins with a Jewish ex-lawyer, Walter (Merab Ninidze, recently in Bride of the Wind) having secured the way for his wife and daughter to escape Germany in 1938 and come to live with him outside Nairobi, Kenya. Wife Jettel (Juliane Kohler, Aimee from Aimee and Jaguar) and daughter Regina (played by two actresses as she ages; the younger, Lea Kurka, was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the German Film Awards) aren't terribly sure what to think when they get there. And, of course, the breaking war isn't content to leave them alone to get acclimated to their new surroundings.Everything about Nowhere in Africa is epic, from Walter's opening bout with quinine to his final decision on whether to go back to Germany in the late forties. This is not necessarily a bad thing, of course, but some of it seemed to be more solemn than it needed to (especially young Regina's friendship with their cook, Owuor [Sidede Onyulo, soon to be seen in The Constant Gardener]). As well, it gets repetitive at times; one wonders whether that was done subconsciously to add to the length of the film (thus making it more epic in scope, natch), or whether it was just a few editing oversights.The film's biggest drawback is that, well, it's set in the Kenya bush country and the cinematographer took next to no advantage of that fact. Huge pan shots of country are seen only when absolutely necessary to the story; no leeway at all is given for panning out at the end of a scene, contemplation of Mount Kenya, you name it. If it's not on the page, it's not in the movie.There is much here to like, and the story is told well, albeit more slowly than it could have been (without slow having the benefit of leisurely here). One wonders, idly, how this could win Best Foreign Film and the superior Rabbit-Proof Fence got completely glossed over by the Academy.

768158,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0000AUHQG,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","The German film ""Nowhere in Africa"" provides a fascinating glimpse into a little known chapter in World War II history.  The film tells of a handful of Jews who, on the eve of the war, fled to the wilds of Kenya to escape the rising tide of anti-Semitism in their home country.  The movie focuses on a lawyer named Walter, his wife, Jettel, and their daughter, Regina, who narrates the tale.The foundation of the story rests on a series of interlocking ironies.  First, these Jewish refugees find themselves being treated in a more humane fashion in this ostensibly ""uncivilized"" society than they were in the so-called ""civilized"" one they've been forced to flee.  Second, the men in this dislocated community end up fighting against their own native country, eagerly joining the allied forces in their attempt to overthrow Hitler.  Moreover, Jettel, although she and her family are themselves victims of prejudice and bigotry, still feels superior to and looks down upon a culture and a people she believes are clearly inferior to her own.  Finally, as the war comes to a close, Walter and Jettel virtually trade places in their attitudes: he, once so eager to remain in Kenya, feeling the need to return to a post-Hitler Germany to help rebuild his native country and she, once so eager to leave it, wanting to remain in a land she has learned to love, a country she has come, in many ways, to think of as her own.In fact, it is the transition Jettel undergoes throughout the course of the story that makes ""Nowhere in Africa"" such a fascinating film.  For Jettel is clearly the most interesting and complex character in the movie.  Haughty and coldly superior at the outset, she eventually comes to see the beauty of ""differences"" that exist between peoples and cultures, an appreciation that, paradoxically, brings home for her the universal nature of human beings.  Despite the grim reality of what is happening to her family and friends back home, Jettel is at first unable to shake the sense of pampered privilege she has long taken for granted as a result of her upper middle class upbringing and background.  But both the land and the people of Kenya soon transform her into a woman who is able to see and understand the truly important things in life - tolerance, acceptance, love, family.  The relationship between Walter and Jettel is a truly complex one; they are not a conventionally happily married couple, but rather one torn apart by their different, often-conflicting views of the world and their somewhat shaky love for one another.  There are times in the movie when we simply do not know where one or the other partner is coming from - and that ambiguity heightens both the reality and the drama of the characters and their situation.  As the ever-observant daughter, Regina is a more conventional, less well-rounded personality, more a plot device than a fully developed character in her own right.  Still, she provides a great deal of the emotional depth needed to fully engage the audience in the story.All the actors are superb, with Juliane Kohler as Jettel proving a particular standout.  In addition, the wide screen photography captures, with crystal clear clarity, the haunting beauty of the African countryside, bringing an almost epic quality to this otherwise intimate family drama.  For, indeed, despite the personal nature of the story, there is lurking ever present in the background - mainly through letters received from desperate and increasingly endangered relatives back home - the larger picture of a world gone suddenly, inexplicably mad, a world that feels strangely remote yet which is all too real in its menace and influence.  This isolated community may provide for these dislocated people a refuge for the body, but it can't provide a refuge for the mind and soul.""Nowhere in Africa"" offers a unique, eye-opening perspective on the holocaust.",4,a unique perspective on the holocaust,1087084800,"06 13, 2004",2004,3892,"['German', 'film', 'Nowhere', 'Africa', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', 'little', 'known', 'chapter', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'history', 'film', 'tells', 'handful', 'Jews', 'who', 'eve', 'war', 'fled', 'wilds', 'Kenya', 'escape', 'rising', 'tide', 'anti-Semitism', 'home', 'country', 'movie', 'lawyer', 'named', 'Walter', 'wife', 'Jettel', 'daughter', 'Regina', 'who', 'tale.The', 'foundation', 'story', 'series', 'interlocking', 'ironies', 'First', 'Jewish', 'refugees', 'find', 'being', 'treated', 'more', 'humane', 'fashion', 'ostensibly', 'uncivilized', 'society', 'were', 'so-called', 'civilized', 'one', ""'ve"", 'been', 'forced', 'flee', 'Second', 'men', 'dislocated', 'community', 'end', 'up', 'fighting', 'own', 'native', 'country', 'eagerly', 'joining', 'allied', 'forces', 'attempt', 'overthrow', 'Hitler', 'Moreover', 'Jettel', 'family', 'are', 'victims', 'prejudice', 'bigotry', 'still', 'superior', 'down', 'culture', 'people', 'are', 'clearly', 'inferior', 'own', 'Finally', 'war', 'close', 'Walter', 'Jettel', 'virtually', 'trade', 'places', 'attitudes', 'once', 'so', 'eager', 'remain', 'Kenya', 'feeling', 'need', 'return', 'post-Hitler', 'Germany', 'help', 'rebuild', 'native', 'country', 'once', 'so', 'eager', 'leave', 'wanting', 'remain', 'land', 'learned', 'love', 'country', 'come', 'many', 'ways', 'think', 'own.In', 'fact', 'transition', 'Jettel', 'course', 'story', 'Nowhere', 'Africa', 'such', 'fascinating', 'film', 'Jettel', 'clearly', 'most', 'interesting', 'complex', 'character', 'movie', 'Haughty', 'coldly', 'superior', 'outset', 'eventually', 'see', 'beauty', 'differences', 'exist', 'peoples', 'cultures', 'appreciation', 'paradoxically', 'home', 'universal', 'nature', 'human', 'beings', 'grim', 'reality', 'what', 'happening', 'family', 'back', 'home', 'Jettel', 'first', 'unable', 'shake', 'sense', 'pampered', 'privilege', 'long', 'taken', 'granted', 'result', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'upbringing', 'background', 'land', 'people', 'Kenya', 'soon', 'transform', 'woman', 'who', 'able', 'see', 'understand', 'truly', 'important', 'things', 'life', 'tolerance', 'acceptance', 'love', 'family', 'relationship', 'Walter', 'Jettel', 'truly', 'complex', 'one', 'are', 'not', 'conventionally', 'happily', 'married', 'couple', 'rather', 'one', 'torn', 'apart', 'different', 'often-conflicting', 'views', 'world', 'somewhat', 'love', 'one', 'are', 'times', 'movie', 'when', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'one', 'other', 'partner', 'coming', 'ambiguity', 'reality', 'drama', 'characters', 'situation', 'ever-observant', 'daughter', 'Regina', 'more', 'conventional', 'less', 'well-rounded', 'personality', 'more', 'plot', 'device', 'fully', 'developed', 'character', 'own', 'right', 'Still', 'great', 'deal', 'emotional', 'depth', 'needed', 'fully', 'engage', 'audience', 'story.All', 'actors', 'are', 'superb', 'Juliane', 'Kohler', 'Jettel', 'proving', 'particular', 'standout', 'addition', 'wide', 'screen', 'photography', 'captures', 'crystal', 'clear', 'clarity', 'haunting', 'beauty', 'African', 'countryside', 'bringing', 'almost', 'epic', 'quality', 'otherwise', 'intimate', 'family', 'drama', 'indeed', 'personal', 'nature', 'story', 'lurking', 'ever', 'present', 'background', 'mainly', 'letters', 'received', 'desperate', 'increasingly', 'endangered', 'back', 'home', 'larger', 'picture', 'world', 'gone', 'suddenly', 'inexplicably', 'mad', 'world', 'strangely', 'remote', 'yet', 'too', 'real', 'menace', 'influence', 'isolated', 'community', 'may', 'provide', 'dislocated', 'people', 'refuge', 'body', 'ca', ""n't"", 'provide', 'refuge', 'mind', 'soul', 'Nowhere', 'Africa', 'unique', 'eye-opening', 'perspective', 'holocaust']",N/A

Some movies such as &quot;Sophie's Choice&quot; or &quot;Nowhere in Africa&quot; bring out the other aspect -&euro;"" people who escaped one horror, but underwent prejudiced treatment or disintegration after immigration to other countries.This film chronicles a German family that sought refuge in the idyllic arms of Kenya. Unlike the eulogistic &quot;Pianist&quot; it actively ventures into the wilds to struggle with the growing awareness of the Holocaust's terrible toll around the world. Locusts, sacrificial lambs, etc lend the film its uncompromisingly graphic metaphors for the exacting beauty and danger of Africa.Apart from the breathtaking vistas of grassland Kenya, the best thing about the movie is that like a good John Irving novel, it's not made up of heroes and villains. It is an unfolding narrative of human beings who face hardships and evolve through them. This requires a feat of casting that the film manages to accomplish rather convincingly (e.g., the daughter in the family is an 8-year old for a part of the movie, then an adoloscent in the latter half.)Quick editing cuts and a swift development of a multi-faceted story, laced with a riveting score of African music, demands the audience's attention from the first frame and holds it right until the credits.Some anti-Semitic words of the headmaster at the daughter's boarding school, or some pithy dialog such as &quot;We are Jews even if that doesn't mean much to you&quot;, dent the script's eloquent but believable language.Yet, overall, &quot;Nowhere in Africa&quot; is a subtle tale of love and belonging couched in the times of war -- that state of humanity that continues to fascinate yet horrify us.A highly recommended gem of film.",4,CAPTIVATING CHRONICLE OF ESCAPE IN VISUALLY GORGEOUS KENYA,1067731200,"11 2, 2003",2003,1842,"['Most', 'World', 'War', 'movies', 'veer', 'gritty', 'theme', 'Holocaust', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'perished', 'heinous', 'regime', 'movies', 'such', 'quot', 'Sophie', 'Choice', 'quot', 'quot', 'Nowhere', 'Africa', 'quot', 'bring', 'out', 'other', 'aspect', 'euro', 'people', 'who', 'escaped', 'one', 'horror', 'underwent', 'prejudiced', 'treatment', 'disintegration', 'immigration', 'other', 'countries.This', 'film', 'German', 'family', 'sought', 'refuge', 'idyllic', 'arms', 'Kenya', 'eulogistic', 'quot', 'Pianist', 'quot', 'actively', 'ventures', 'wilds', 'struggle', 'growing', 'awareness', 'Holocaust', 'terrible', 'toll', 'world', 'Locusts', 'sacrificial', 'lambs', 'etc', 'lend', 'film', 'uncompromisingly', 'graphic', 'metaphors', 'exacting', 'beauty', 'danger', 'Africa.Apart', 'breathtaking', 'vistas', 'grassland', 'Kenya', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'good', 'John', 'Irving', 'novel', 'not', 'made', 'heroes', 'villains', 'unfolding', 'narrative', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'face', 'hardships', 'evolve', 'feat', 'casting', 'film', 'accomplish', 'rather', 'convincingly', 'e.g.', 'daughter', 'family', '8-year', 'old', 'part', 'movie', 'then', 'adoloscent', 'latter', 'half', 'Quick', 'editing', 'cuts', 'swift', 'development', 'multi-faceted', 'story', 'laced', 'riveting', 'score', 'African', 'music', 'audience', 'attention', 'first', 'frame', 'right', 'credits.Some', 'anti-Semitic', 'words', 'headmaster', 'daughter', 'boarding', 'school', 'pithy', 'dialog', 'such', 'quot', 'are', 'Jews', 'even', ""n't"", 'mean', 'much', 'quot', 'dent', 'script', 'eloquent', 'believable', 'language.Yet', 'overall', 'quot', 'Nowhere', 'Africa', 'quot', 'subtle', 'tale', 'love', 'belonging', 'couched', 'times', 'war', 'state', 'humanity', 'fascinate', 'yet', 'horrify', 'us.A', 'highly', 'recommended', 'gem', 'film']",N/A
768163,A30OXD42ZFYZLO,B0000AUHQG,Thomas Keneally,"[4, 5]","Caroline Link's movie ""Nowhere in Africa"" is based on the story of Stephanie Zweig, who lived in Colonial Kenya to escape the Nazis. The author should not be confused with Stephan Zweig, the great Austrian Jewish author. The movie is unusual in its tone and direction. It shows the life of Walter and Jettel and their daughter, Regina who move to rural Kenya during the Holocaust. Owour, their servant plays a beautiful part in bringing the movie together. Jettel who hates the place, acts like a princess. Her frivolity precipitates the first of many domestic clashes that seriously strain the Redlichs' marriage. Jettel initially hates her new life and treats the natives like servants. She embarrasses Owuor by asking him to carry water, a task only the women in his tribe perform. She even looks down on her husband, now that he's a humble farmer no longer practicing law. Eventually, he puts her in her place by telling her that she is treating Owour the way the Nazis are treating the Jews, a slight exaggaration, but some truth to it. While Jettel starts as a vain, snobbish person, she eventually adapts to the situation as a self-reliant person.Regina eagerly embraces her new circumstances and befriends the native children her own age and learns their language, and the scenes of the girl frolicking with her African peers evoke an idyllic cultural merger. She is a pleasure to watch and her interaction with Owour is special. By the time the war breaks out, the situation gets dire back home as Jettel's family is interned. Even in Africa, the anti-semitism is obvious. In Regina's school, people treat the Jewish students differently from the other students. She is also talked to unkindly by the school principal.Eventually after the war Walter (who is Bavarian), wishes to go back to Germany, but Jettel gets used to the place does not wish it. Niki Reiser's African-flavored symphonic music (similar in style to Hans Zimmer's film scores) underlines the visual sweep. The movie has beautiful photography that gives it both the landscape and the colonial life the elegance of a coffee-table picture book. While the movie may have some inconsistencies such as making the colonial life appear OK, and basking in the illusion that the past was so much prettier than the present, it still is a wonderfully made one and a pleasure to watch.",5,Unusual movie touching on the survival during Holocaust,1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,2350,"['Caroline', 'Link', 'movie', 'Nowhere', 'Africa', 'based', 'story', 'Stephanie', 'Zweig', 'who', 'lived', 'Colonial', 'Kenya', 'escape', 'Nazis', 'author', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'Stephan', 'Zweig', 'great', 'Austrian', 'Jewish', 'author', 'movie', 'unusual', 'tone', 'direction', 'life', 'Walter', 'Jettel', 'daughter', 'Regina', 'who', 'move', 'rural', 'Kenya', 'Holocaust', 'Owour', 'servant', 'beautiful', 'part', 'bringing', 'movie', 'together', 'Jettel', 'who', 'place', 'princess', 'frivolity', 'first', 'many', 'domestic', 'clashes', 'seriously', 'strain', 'Redlichs', 'marriage', 'Jettel', 'initially', 'new', 'life', 'natives', 'servants', 'Owuor', 'asking', 'carry', 'water', 'task', 'only', 'women', 'tribe', 'perform', 'even', 'down', 'husband', 'now', 'humble', 'farmer', 'no', 'longer', 'practicing', 'law', 'Eventually', 'place', 'telling', 'treating', 'way', 'Nazis', 'are', 'treating', 'Jews', 'slight', 'exaggaration', 'truth', 'Jettel', 'vain', 'snobbish', 'person', 'eventually', 'situation', 'self-reliant', 'person.Regina', 'eagerly', 'new', 'circumstances', 'native', 'children', 'own', 'age', 'language', 'scenes', 'girl', 'frolicking', 'African', 'peers', 'evoke', 'idyllic', 'cultural', 'merger', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'interaction', 'Owour', 'special', 'time', 'war', 'out', 'situation', 'dire', 'back', 'home', 'Jettel', 'family', 'interned', 'Even', 'Africa', 'anti-semitism', 'obvious', 'Regina', 'school', 'people', 'treat', 'Jewish', 'students', 'differently', 'other', 'students', 'also', 'talked', 'unkindly', 'school', 'principal.Eventually', 'war', 'Walter', 'who', 'Bavarian', 'go', 'back', 'Germany', 'Jettel', 'used', 'place', 'not', 'wish', 'Niki', 'Reiser', 'African-flavored', 'symphonic', 'music', 'similar', 'style', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'film', 'scores', 'underlines', 'visual', 'sweep', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'landscape', 'colonial', 'life', 'elegance', 'coffee-table', 'picture', 'book', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'inconsistencies', 'such', 'making', 'colonial', 'life', 'appear', 'OK', 'basking', 'illusion', 'past', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'prettier', 'present', 'still', 'wonderfully', 'made', 'one', 'pleasure', 'watch']",N/A

The husband (Merab Ninidze) was a lawyer in his native land, and he becomes a farmer in Africa, working for others.  Their daughter (Lea Kurka and Karoline Eckertz) grows up with her heart in Africa, and little or no recollection of Germany.Their families are killed in the Nazi Holocaust, even though the husband tries in vain to warn them of the coming storm, and get them to leave.  They believe that they are Germans and safe, and that no harm will come to them.  After the war ends, the husband is offered a job as a judge in Frankfurt and the family returns, even though the wife (Juliane K&ouml;hler) and daughter resist and have almost no feelings for the country at all--only negatives ones on the part of the wife, who believes they would be living among the murderers of their families.It is a lovely film of Africa, not the lush scenes of ""Out of Africa,"" but a much harsher existence.  The central characters are the husband, wife and daughter.  However, the heart and soul of Kenya--if not Africa itself--seems to be embodied and reflected in Sidede Onyulo, who portrays the family's cook and spirit, and connects all of the characters.

The music was a mix of African beats both dark and joyful with a mix of the classics.All the actors were great and very natural and the mood of the film reminded me of the ""Trees Of Theikla,"" and a little of 'Out OF Africa.""The movie centers on a family in Germany pre WW2. The husband, Walter, sees the Nazis' are not going to leave the Jews alone and he strikes out for Kenya, Africa to work on a cattle farm. He was a lawyer in Germany but his credentials were taken away from him. He sends for his wife and five year old daughter. The period of adjustment does not come quickly to the wife, Jettel, but, Regina has already taken the wide eyed acceptance of the young. She makes fast friends with the Masai cook Owour and he looks out for her. And teaches Regina the native languages.Soon war breaks out in Europe and the Brits round up all the German immigrants and bring them in to their compounds. Which for the women and children is like staying at the Grand Hotel.Walter has been fired from his job on the cattle ranch as the owner does not want a German working for him. Jettle, has a contact and is able to get Walter another job on a farm this time. Jettle is coming around to wanting to stay in Africa. But, Walter is growing impatient and wants to do something for the war effort. He joins the British army. There is much tension between Walter and Jettle, she stays on the farm and he lives in the compound and visits. The war ends and Walter wants to go back to Germany.

'Nowhere in Africa"" is an absolutely beautiful movie about people making a life for themselves in a far-off country when their own rejects them and they deal with the complexities that arise as a result.Based on Stefanie Zweig's autobiographical novel, the film tells the true life story of a young Jewish girl and her mother who leave Germany right before the outbreak of WW II. Regina and her mother, Jettel join her father Walter in Kenya to escape Nazi persecution [at a time when expatriation was still possible in Germany]. Jettel has been used to a life of luxury [as Walter used to work as a successful lawyer before the Nazis came to power] and is shocked and dismayed at the simple living conditions in Kenya. Walter has no status in Kenyan society, he is treated as an outsider, and earns a living managing farms for other foreign nationals. Jettel looks down upon the native Kenyans, and this infuriates her husband who likens her attitude to that of the Nazis.It is only with the passage of time that Jettel comes to adapt to her life in Kenya, living among the natives and even appreciating their down-to-earth manner. Regina is the one who is most at ease amongst the wilds of Kenya - she gets along famously with the natives, forming a close bond with their Kenyan cook, Owour, and even though she gets sent off to boarding school, she still maintains a close affection for the natives and keeps local friendships going when she returns on holidays.Ironically, it is Walter who turns out to be the least immersed - he enlists in the war on the side of the Allies, and upon war's end, decides to return to Frankfurt to work as a judge. Jettel and Regina are against this and the family needs to figure out what's best for them.The human relationships in this well-crafted drama are effectively and credibly portrayed - Jettel and Walter embody a couple who seem incompatible when forced into harsh circumstances - Jettel rails against Walter for letting her down [due to his diminished earning capacity], whilst Walter yearns for a wife who is 'more mature' and empathetic. It takes the passage of years [throughout the war] for them to come to terms with each other, shedding their preconceived notions and prejudices along the way. Regina too 'grows' - from a precocious young child with an idealistic picture of her parents to a compassionate and mature adolescent who comes to accept the joys and pitfalls of human relationships.All the actors portray their roles with conviction and credibility. The cinematography is simply stunning - be it the wilds of Kenya, the tribes dancing during a feast, or even an old lady who is peacefully awaiting death, each scene 'speaks' to the soul and leaves an indelible mark upon the viewer.Highly recommended!",5,Lyrical and poignant drama about displaced people,1234051200,"02 8, 2009",2009,2840,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'taken', 'so', 'long', 'discover', 'gem', 'movie', 'Africa', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'people', 'making', 'life', 'far-off', 'country', 'when', 'own', 'rejects', 'deal', 'complexities', 'arise', 'result.Based', 'Stefanie', 'Zweig', 'autobiographical', 'novel', 'film', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'young', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'mother', 'who', 'leave', 'Germany', 'right', 'outbreak', 'WW', 'II', 'Regina', 'mother', 'Jettel', 'father', 'Walter', 'Kenya', 'escape', 'Nazi', 'persecution', '[', 'time', 'when', 'expatriation', 'was', 'still', 'possible', 'Germany', ']', 'Jettel', 'been', 'used', 'life', 'luxury', '[', 'Walter', 'used', 'work', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'Nazis', 'came', 'power', ']', 'shocked', 'dismayed', 'simple', 'living', 'conditions', 'Kenya', 'Walter', 'status', 'Kenyan', 'society', 'treated', 'outsider', 'living', 'managing', 'farms', 'other', 'foreign', 'nationals', 'Jettel', 'down', 'native', 'Kenyans', 'husband', 'who', 'attitude', 'Nazis.It', 'only', 'passage', 'time', 'Jettel', 'adapt', 'life', 'Kenya', 'living', 'natives', 'even', 'appreciating', 'down-to-earth', 'manner', 'Regina', 'one', 'who', 'most', 'ease', 'amongst', 'wilds', 'Kenya', 'along', 'famously', 'natives', 'forming', 'close', 'bond', 'Kenyan', 'cook', 'Owour', 'even', 'sent', 'off', 'boarding', 'school', 'still', 'close', 'affection', 'natives', 'local', 'friendships', 'going', 'when', 'holidays.Ironically', 'Walter', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'least', 'immersed', 'war', 'side', 'Allies', 'war', 'end', 'return', 'Frankfurt', 'work', 'judge', 'Jettel', 'Regina', 'are', 'family', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'best', 'them.The', 'human', 'relationships', 'well-crafted', 'drama', 'are', 'effectively', 'credibly', 'portrayed', 'Jettel', 'Walter', 'embody', 'couple', 'who', 'seem', 'incompatible', 'when', 'forced', 'harsh', 'circumstances', 'Jettel', 'rails', 'Walter', 'letting', 'down', '[', 'due', 'diminished', 'earning', 'capacity', ']', 'whilst', 'Walter', 'wife', 'who', ""'more"", 'mature', 'empathetic', 'passage', 'years', '[', 'war', ']', 'come', 'terms', 'other', 'shedding', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'prejudices', 'way', 'Regina', 'too', 'precocious', 'young', 'child', 'idealistic', 'picture', 'parents', 'compassionate', 'mature', 'adolescent', 'who', 'accept', 'joys', 'pitfalls', 'human', 'relationships.All', 'actors', 'portray', 'roles', 'conviction', 'credibility', 'cinematography', 'simply', 'stunning', 'be', 'wilds', 'Kenya', 'tribes', 'dancing', 'feast', 'even', 'old', 'lady', 'who', 'peacefully', 'awaiting', 'death', 'scene', 'soul', 'indelible', 'mark', 'viewer.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
