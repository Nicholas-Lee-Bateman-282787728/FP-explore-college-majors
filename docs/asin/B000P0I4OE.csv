1067780,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B000P0I4OE,Artist & Author,"[5, 6]","For traditional values families, especially religious families, any movie that is subtlety based on Scripture has to be well worth watching.  This is actually a (university) student project movie, but it is done in every way as professional as the best of what Hollywood produces.  It will hold the interest of both the kids - my grandson was five when he saw it - and their parents, so it truly is a great family movie.  Roy is fascinated by the 'ghost' of the cave, and sets out to solve the mystery.  Along the way, it seems that the ghost does good deeds for the people in the community.  When the mystery is solved, it is made clear that the basis for the good deeds was to follow Jesus' teaching that when you have done it the least of these, you have done it to Me.  I can hardly think of a better movie for families.In response to the one-star reviewers, I'd say that their reviews reveal their bias against anything Christian - even when it is as subtle as its presented in this movie - more than their ability to  judge movies.  As of this writing, I have about 4,000 DVDs of live-action movies for kids, about kids, or appropriate for kids (e.g. Historical stories, nature, biographies, etc.),  I watch as many as 35 movies a week and write reviews of them when I am writing at my mountain cottage.  Therefore, I think I can say that I have a pretty broad basis from which to judge movies, especially those pertaining to children and teens.  The 'Secret of the Cave' easily come in among the top 5% of movies made for or about kids, especially for families that want to instill good character and long-established traditional values.  It may not be 'politically correct' to advocate orthodox morality, but Universal laws cannot be changed by personal opinions.  For those who believe that there is a right and wrong, and who believe that doing good deeds for people in need (personally, NOT through the government) is indeed  as if it was done for the Lord, this movie is top notch.[Maybe I need to add that I am Catholic and not Adventist, and that I do not know any of this group (although I do know many Hollywood stars and movie crew members).

Clearly it was funded by donors who felt they were furthering some sort of ""Christian"" cause -- not by investors who knew a good film potential when they saw one.  The script is terrible.  The story was moved to Ireland from the book's Scottish setting--a change that alters much of the sense and sensibilties of the original oh-so-Scottish story.  But clearly the amateurs who wrote and produced this film don't get any of that.  Beyond that, the directing is some of the worst film-making you'll see in a long time.  Pick any of the basics: Timing, Dialog, Composition, Interaction, and especially Reaction.  They are so far off as to defy belief that the little Bible college attached to the production even let the film go into release.  The original story has wonderful nuance and some (but not a lot of) tension.  The screenplay leaves all the good parts out and adds innanity and sacharine elements that simply ruin an otherwise nice story.One of the worst movies to make it into DVD release in a long time.

I was impressed not only by the movie, but also by the quality of the DVD, which showed the feature in 1.78:1 aspect anamorphic widescreen and contained an 18 minute full frame, making-of featurette, 'Behind the Secret', in addition to two full-length commentary tracks, one by Southern Adventist University School of Visual Art and Design faculty (director Zach Gray and producer/cinematographer David George) and the other by university students, which point out a wealth of candid information about the filmmaking process, including why the ending shot (finding a photograph in a trunk) is not the ending shown (finding a note in the trunk) and why CGI was used to add toast to a breakfast scene. Amazon.com listed three 'Secret of the Cave' DVDs. Amazon's ASIN B000P0I4OE, released 9/4/2007, was listed as NTSC widescreen with aspect 1.77:1, but no mention was made of special features. ASIN B0015XHQXA, released 6/3/2008, was only listed as NTSC with no mention of aspect or special features. ASIN B001IS5XHS, released 8/7/2009, was also only listed as NTSC with no mention of aspect or special features. The library disc was released in 2007, but the 2009 disc had a much lower Marketplace seller price. I ordered the 2009 DVD, reasoning that it would be unlikely that both full frame and widescreen DVD masters would be made for an independent film. The DVD I received has the same anamorphic widescreen format and the same special features as the 2007 DVD has; both the DVD and its case insert bear the same 2006 copyright for the film and the same 2007 copyright for the artwork, making it difficult, but not impossible, to distinguish it from the 2007 DVD.

The story follows a twelve year old boy who is sent to Ireland to live with distant relatives for the Summer. Once in this small coastal village, he learns that for decades people have claimed to have heard strange noises coming from a cave underneath the cemetery. When I first heard about this film, I thought it could be a hidden gem. I knew it would be someone strange, but I really had no idea just how strange it would be. The lead is newcomer, Kevin Novotny, and he did a pretty good job, especially in his first film. Unfortunately his performance is wasted in a film that is very slow and really doesn't go anywhere. The dialogue, the town, and the characters were very weird and the direction was a joke! As soon as something interesting started, the film would jump to something else that really doesn't fit with anything else. Roy doesn't even have the courage to enter the cave until the last fifteen minutes of the movie and once he does, what he finds is extremely stupid. Novotny's performance aside, the only positive thing I can say about this film was that it wasn't predictable, because you really couldn't figure out what the hell was going on half the time.
