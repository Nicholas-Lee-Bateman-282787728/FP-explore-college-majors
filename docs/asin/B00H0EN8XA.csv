I watched this late at night, and it came off the screen so shocking at times I was tempted to stop it. However I was hooked/so captivated by the editing - acting - nuanced presentation... I could not force myself to do it.  It was like seeing a bad accident, but then driving by slowly to look at it. The acting.. where do they get these people??  Mr. Kinnaman -- flawless performance -- Fares Fares... I'll follow him anywhere.. I have to watch it again to enjoy what I didn't see.

1682941,A11PKVBGCKRVEK,B00H0EN8XA,"Keith Otis Edwards ""Keith Otis Edwards""","[1, 3]","When I attended a screening of EM/HtK, it was poorly attended. That may because of the blizzard that night, or it may have been because a popular on-line site of movie reviews gave it a mere 53% on their Lettuce meter. At the time, their highest rated film wasThe LEGO Movie, and that, I think, explains this movie's poor reception in the US.It's a famous truism among Hollywood producers that ""People don't go to the movies to get depressed,"" and Americans might've liked this movie more if, after all the mayhem, the female lead and the young desperado had ridden off into the sunset and were last seen walking down a beach at sunset and holding hands.But for those of us who admire realism, not cartoon fantasy, this is an extraordinarily gripping movie. As Europe suffers through the effects of the IMF's austerity penance, unemployment among young people in some nations approaches 50%, and in such circumstances they turn to crime. This is the case not only in Madrid and Athens (and Detroit), but as people migrate north, everywhere, including Stockholm, where this movie is set.Actor Joel Kinnaman's role is diminished from the first movie in the series, and it's also less interesting, but the rest of the cast more than makes up for this.Ignore the Product Description given above, because it's wildly inaccurate.&iexcl; &#8805; SPOILER ALERT &#8804; &#8805; SPOILER ALERT &#8804;  !If you have not yet seen EM/HtK, please read no further.The only false note in this grim movie is near the end, where the two sympathetic characters, Nadja, the young woman who has been forced into prostitution, and Jorge, the guy who begs his dead mother for forgiveness for all his misdeeds, fall in love but are tragically gunned down by a shotgun-wielding assassin from the mob.  Getting blasted by a 12-gauge at point-blank range would, in reality, have left her viscera splattered across the room, and when the guy takes a load of buckshot in the upper back, he miraculously does not go into shock or even cough blood. Instead, as they are wheeled into the ambulance, they smile and make dewy eyes at each other.It's a mawkishly sentimental scene in an otherwise uncompromising movie.",4,"Relentlessly Violent, Morbid and Depressing",1393718400,"03 2, 2014",2014,2183,"['When', 'attended', 'screening', 'EM/HtK', 'was', 'poorly', 'attended', 'may', 'blizzard', 'night', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'popular', 'on-line', 'site', 'movie', 'reviews', 'gave', 'mere', '53', '%', 'Lettuce', 'meter', 'time', 'highest', 'rated', 'film', 'wasThe', 'LEGO', 'Movie', 'think', 'movie', 'poor', 'reception', 'US.It', 'famous', 'truism', 'Hollywood', 'producers', 'People', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'movies', 'get', 'depressed', 'Americans', 'might', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'movie', 'more', 'mayhem', 'female', 'lead', 'young', 'desperado', 'had', 'ridden', 'off', 'sunset', 'were', 'last', 'seen', 'walking', 'down', 'beach', 'sunset', 'holding', 'hands.But', 'who', 'admire', 'realism', 'not', 'cartoon', 'fantasy', 'extraordinarily', 'gripping', 'movie', 'Europe', 'effects', 'IMF', 'austerity', 'penance', 'unemployment', 'young', 'people', 'nations', 'approaches', '50', '%', 'such', 'circumstances', 'turn', 'crime', 'case', 'not', 'only', 'Madrid', 'Athens', 'Detroit', 'people', 'migrate', 'north', 'everywhere', 'including', 'Stockholm', 'where', 'movie', 'set.Actor', 'Joel', 'Kinnaman', 'role', 'diminished', 'first', 'movie', 'series', 'also', 'less', 'interesting', 'rest', 'cast', 'more', 'up', 'Product', 'Description', 'given', 'above', 'wildly', 'inaccurate.', 'iexcl', '8805', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', '8804', '8805', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', '8804', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'EM/HtK', 'please', 'read', 'further.The', 'only', 'false', 'note', 'grim', 'movie', 'end', 'where', 'two', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'Nadja', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'forced', 'prostitution', 'Jorge', 'guy', 'who', 'dead', 'mother', 'forgiveness', 'misdeeds', 'fall', 'love', 'are', 'tragically', 'gunned', 'down', 'shotgun-wielding', 'assassin', 'mob', 'Getting', 'blasted', '12-gauge', 'point-blank', 'range', 'would', 'reality', 'have', 'left', 'viscera', 'splattered', 'room', 'when', 'guy', 'load', 'buckshot', 'upper', 'back', 'miraculously', 'not', 'go', 'shock', 'even', 'cough', 'blood', 'Instead', 'are', 'wheeled', 'ambulance', 'smile', 'make', 'dewy', 'eyes', 'other.It', 'mawkishly', 'sentimental', 'scene', 'otherwise', 'uncompromising', 'movie']",Easy Money: Hard to Kill

1682944,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B00H0EN8XA,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[1, 1]","This is the follow up to the enormously successful `Easy Money'. It has the same actors and picks up where the first one left off - but the good news is you do not have to have seen part 1 in order to be able to follow this one, as everything is put into context. We meet J.W. who has been banged up for his past indiscretions and is reunited with Mrado; who despite his injuries being down to J.W. they have become friends. J.W. has spent his time in prison developing software that will earn him a bucket load of money and hopefully rehabilitate him with his former life.We also have two stories running in parallel; that of Mahmoud, who is a small fry foot soldier, working for Mr Big - Radovan- who is a Serbian crime lord. And would be drugs trafficker Jorge, who seems to leave a trail of dead behind him wherever he goes.Although they are all working on their own scams, fate has a hand that will conspire to ensure all their paths cross and the result will not be a happy one. This is a tale of drugs, prostitution, crime lords, violence and money laundering. The violence is gritty and often, but it all felt totally in place given the context of the film.It is a full on adrenalin rush too with edge of seat action and jaw droppingly good camera work. Joel Kinnaman as J.W. does a superb job as does all the cast. This is in Swedish, Spanish, English, Serbian, Arabic and Croation with very good subtitles and a run time of 96 minutes. Another movie adapted from a novel by Jens Lapidus and another great film to add to the impressive list of Nordic Noir - absolutely recommended.",4,More Nordic Noir Action from Sweden,1405123200,"07 12, 2014",2014,1590,"['follow', 'up', 'enormously', 'successful', 'Easy', 'Money', 'same', 'actors', 'up', 'where', 'first', 'one', 'left', 'off', 'good', 'news', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'have', 'seen', 'part', '1', 'order', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'one', 'everything', 'put', 'context', 'meet', 'J.W', 'who', 'been', 'banged', 'up', 'past', 'indiscretions', 'reunited', 'Mrado', 'who', 'injuries', 'being', 'down', 'J.W', 'have', 'become', 'friends', 'J.W', 'spent', 'time', 'prison', 'developing', 'software', 'will', 'earn', 'bucket', 'load', 'money', 'hopefully', 'rehabilitate', 'former', 'life.We', 'also', 'have', 'two', 'stories', 'running', 'parallel', 'Mahmoud', 'who', 'small', 'fry', 'foot', 'soldier', 'working', 'Mr', 'Big', 'Radovan-', 'who', 'Serbian', 'crime', 'lord', 'would', 'be', 'drugs', 'trafficker', 'Jorge', 'who', 'leave', 'trail', 'dead', 'wherever', 'are', 'working', 'own', 'scams', 'fate', 'hand', 'will', 'conspire', 'ensure', 'paths', 'cross', 'result', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'happy', 'one', 'tale', 'drugs', 'prostitution', 'crime', 'lords', 'violence', 'money', 'laundering', 'violence', 'gritty', 'often', 'felt', 'totally', 'place', 'given', 'context', 'film.It', 'full', 'adrenalin', 'rush', 'too', 'edge', 'seat', 'action', 'jaw', 'droppingly', 'good', 'camera', 'work', 'Joel', 'Kinnaman', 'J.W', 'superb', 'job', 'cast', 'Swedish', 'Spanish', 'English', 'Serbian', 'Arabic', 'Croation', 'very', 'good', 'subtitles', 'run', 'time', '96', 'minutes', 'movie', 'adapted', 'novel', 'Jens', 'Lapidus', 'great', 'film', 'add', 'impressive', 'list', 'Nordic', 'Noir', 'absolutely', 'recommended']",Easy Money: Hard to Kill
