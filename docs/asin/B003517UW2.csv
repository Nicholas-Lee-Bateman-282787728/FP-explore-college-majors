1325984,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B003517UW2,J. Martin,"[0, 2]","It's impossible to write a meaningful review of this movie without revealing the surprise ending. Anybody who leaves out the last 20 minutes is giving an unbalanced review that will leave many viewers feeling angry and betrayed if they see the movie based on that review. This is one of the three huge flaws in the movie, which I will elaborate below.SPOILER ALERT:PROCEED ONLY IF YOU ALREADY KNOW OR WANT TO KNOW HOW THIS MOVIE ENDS.-------------That's its first big flaw. This movie forces a conscientious reviewer to reveal the ending because it presents itself dishonestly as a gently romantic and sensitive character study when it's really a thriller. The ending betrays a viewer who has fallen under its sensitive, romantic spell with a shocking twist at the end. That is certainly a novel approach in movie-making, but it's also mean-spirited - almost as bad as secretly rewriting Winnie-the-Pooh so that it ends with Christopher Robin being gang-raped, but not warning parents before they read the book to their children.This is as good a place as any to deal with the often-repeated excuse ""But it's a true story!"", because that's a lie. Even if the Davy Rothbart story the movie is based on is completely true (and there's good reason to doubt that), this movie distorts his story. (You can still read it on the GQ website, as I did; it's a badly-written and annoying story, by the way - hardly worth making into a movie.)In the story, Davy had already suspected that ""Nicole"" might be a man, but he was having fun so he kept playing the phone-sex game. He was savvy and worldly, not at all the totally clueless, paralyzingly shy man the Davy in the movie is. It is unforgivable for the movie to create such a helpless, hopeless, rawly vulnerable character and then rip his slowly emerging, microscopic hopes to shreds the way this horrible movie does.That's its second big flaw. It creates a preternaturally innocent, naive and vulnerable protagonist and then brutalizes him for entertainment.The third, and to me the most unforgivable, flaw in this offensive movie is that the horror at the end of the tunnel is the fact that ""Nicole"" is really a gay man. Aaron is a man almost as shy and vulnerable as Davy is, but he's as unattractive as Davy is adorable. Davy is enormously appealing in his innocence and his sweet vulnerability - but Aaron is just a sleazy, lying, slimy creep.Being gay is wonderful. I love it. I wouldn't be straight if you gave me a billion dollars. So having the monster who suddenly punches you in the gut at the end of a ""heartwarming"" movie be a gay man is deeply insulting. And then to have him be a creep, a pervert, a disgusting loser - in sharp contrast to Davy's charming, heartwarming (and straight!) loser - makes the insult even more appalling.I cannot imagine what kind of person likes this movie. Certainly not any gay person; or any shy person, gay or straight; or anyone who cares about shy or gay people. The only audience I can imagine for this movie is severely abused women serving life sentences for murdering their abusers. They might be able to identify with the Davy this movie creates and then savages for entertainment by revealing that his secret love is a gay creep.Don't blame it on Rothbart's story, as dumb and offensive as that story is; blame it on Alvarez's movie, which is far worse.",1,A dishonest and mean-spirited movie,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,3353,"['impossible', 'write', 'meaningful', 'review', 'movie', 'revealing', 'surprise', 'ending', 'Anybody', 'who', 'out', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'giving', 'unbalanced', 'review', 'will', 'leave', 'many', 'viewers', 'feeling', 'angry', 'betrayed', 'see', 'movie', 'based', 'review', 'one', 'three', 'huge', 'flaws', 'movie', 'will', 'elaborate', 'below.SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'PROCEED', 'ONLY', 'IF', 'YOU', 'ALREADY', 'KNOW', 'OR', 'WANT', 'TO', 'KNOW', 'HOW', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'ENDS.', '-That', 'first', 'big', 'flaw', 'movie', 'conscientious', 'reviewer', 'reveal', 'ending', 'dishonestly', 'gently', 'romantic', 'sensitive', 'character', 'study', 'when', 'really', 'thriller', 'ending', 'betrays', 'viewer', 'who', 'fallen', 'sensitive', 'romantic', 'spell', 'shocking', 'twist', 'end', 'certainly', 'novel', 'approach', 'movie-making', 'also', 'mean-spirited', 'almost', 'as', 'bad', 'secretly', 'rewriting', 'Winnie-the-Pooh', 'Christopher', 'Robin', 'being', 'gang-raped', 'not', 'warning', 'parents', 'read', 'book', 'children.This', 'as', 'good', 'place', 'deal', 'often-repeated', 'excuse', 'true', 'story', 'lie', 'Even', 'Davy', 'Rothbart', 'story', 'movie', 'based', 'completely', 'true', 'good', 'reason', 'doubt', 'movie', 'story', 'can', 'still', 'read', 'GQ', 'website', 'did', 'badly-written', 'annoying', 'story', 'way', 'hardly', 'worth', 'making', 'movie', 'story', 'Davy', 'had', 'already', 'suspected', 'Nicole', 'might', 'be', 'man', 'was', 'having', 'fun', 'so', 'kept', 'playing', 'phone-sex', 'game', 'was', 'savvy', 'worldly', 'not', 'totally', 'clueless', 'paralyzingly', 'shy', 'man', 'Davy', 'movie', 'unforgivable', 'movie', 'create', 'such', 'helpless', 'hopeless', 'rawly', 'vulnerable', 'character', 'then', 'rip', 'slowly', 'emerging', 'microscopic', 'hopes', 'shreds', 'way', 'horrible', 'movie', 'does.That', 'second', 'big', 'flaw', 'preternaturally', 'innocent', 'naive', 'vulnerable', 'protagonist', 'then', 'entertainment.The', 'third', 'most', 'unforgivable', 'flaw', 'offensive', 'movie', 'horror', 'end', 'tunnel', 'fact', 'Nicole', 'really', 'gay', 'man', 'Aaron', 'man', 'almost', 'shy', 'vulnerable', 'Davy', 'as', 'unattractive', 'Davy', 'adorable', 'Davy', 'enormously', 'appealing', 'innocence', 'sweet', 'vulnerability', 'Aaron', 'just', 'sleazy', 'lying', 'slimy', 'creep.Being', 'gay', 'wonderful', 'love', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'straight', 'gave', 'billion', 'dollars', 'So', 'having', 'monster', 'who', 'suddenly', 'gut', 'end', 'heartwarming', 'movie', 'be', 'gay', 'man', 'deeply', 'insulting', 'then', 'have', 'be', 'creep', 'pervert', 'disgusting', 'loser', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'Davy', 'charming', 'heartwarming', 'straight', 'loser', 'insult', 'even', 'more', 'appalling.I', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'likes', 'movie', 'Certainly', 'not', 'gay', 'person', 'shy', 'person', 'gay', 'straight', 'anyone', 'who', 'shy', 'gay', 'people', 'only', 'audience', 'can', 'imagine', 'movie', 'severely', 'abused', 'women', 'serving', 'life', 'sentences', 'murdering', 'abusers', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'Davy', 'movie', 'then', 'savages', 'entertainment', 'revealing', 'secret', 'love', 'gay', 'creep.Do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Rothbart', 'story', 'dumb', 'offensive', 'story', 'blame', 'Alvarez', 'movie', 'far', 'worse']",Easier with Practice
1325985,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B003517UW2,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[1, 3]","(( ""Davy"" is a Lead character who is experiencing unsettling emotional / behavioral problems.  More  significantly, he may be one who is yet to discover something extremely important about himself  ))Whether this movie's background is just story-writer, Rothbart's own.....or whether it's part his life / part fiction.....or just a tale made up for a fictional Davy, is not important here.  Instead, what we need to focus on is that the Lead in this film, unquestionably, comes across as having had much more than the usual problems in relating to females.  Specifically, those females with whom he has attempted to become more than just friends.  Yet, with all other people in his life, Davy seems a likeable sort.....that is, when or if, they even realize he is around (he often seems ""Overlooked"").I truly believe this film shows us, intentionally or not, that Davy is way more unhappy than we see on the surface.....and will likely always be unhappy. Why?  Because he is trying to live up to the ""norms"" which society is forever instilling in us.....and has never allowed himself to consider / experience other possibilities.  But what Davy (and all of us) need to discover is that when we have met a person who has grown all-important to us, a someone we have come to love and want to spend our future with....THEN, such things as our color...our sex...and other factors, should not be deciding ones.  If we BOTH want this THING we've built.....then that is the way it should be.At film's end, Davy faces a choice.  Will it be one he allows outside pressures decide for him.....or will he make it based on his own inner desires?  My best advice to you, Davy, is to:  Follow your heart.....and never let fear of what you don't know keep you from finding the one of your dreams.  The ""Nicole"" we come to meet may very well be your best chance at happiness.Final word for our Lead:  Oh, Davy, take that chance.....See if it will make you happy!PS for Viewers:  Never let fear of what you don't know.....keep you from finding happiness.

1325988,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003517UW2,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Easier with Practice (Kyle Patrick Alvarez, 2009)There is a lot about Easier with Practice to like; it feels like (and, really, it is) the kind of story that a stranger sitting next to you in the bar, with whom you've struck up a conversation because there's nothing better to do and the TV is turned to baseball yet again, tells you out of the blue in order to get it off his chest. That feeling carries through into the film realm very well, at least it does in this picture. The problem is that, as the story goes on, you get a very distinct feeling that perhaps the nice guy sitting next to you is maybe not quite as nice as he may have at first seemed. Now, it's entirely possible to paint this in a good light&#8212;he's being as honest as he can be about his feelings and reactions to the situation in which he finds himself, and any therapist worth his or her salt will tell you that you can't effectively process this sort of stuff without being entirely honest with yourself. On the other hand, when you show it to outsiders, to people who weren't there, the urge to whitewash things, to make yourself look better, is sometimes best followed. (That it might well have changed the ending of the story here is irrelevant.)As we open, Davy Mitchell (ATM's Brian Geraghty), a budding novelist, is on media's most depressing book tour with his brother Sean (Pulse's Kel O'Neill). They've financed the entire thing themselves, they're halfway across the country, they're near-broke, and they're not selling anything out of that trunkful of books. (As a side note, the movie is based on a GQ article by Davy Rothbart, who had a version of this story actually happen to him while he was touring Found exactly like this. I found that bit the most believable part of the story, for those of you reading this somewhere where the book title is a link to my review of Found.) One night, in a generic, nameless motel, he gets a call from breathy-voiced Nicole (Black Rock's Katie Aselton). They have phone sex, which eventually develops into a relationship. Nicole refuses to meet Davy in the flesh, which leads to the question&#8212;can you have a relationship with someone you have never seen?One of the movie's problems is that that question has been a kind of ridiculous one since, oh, two or three years after the world wide web went global (for those of you too young to remember, that happened in 1993). Which is not to say it can't still be asked&#8212;there is a movie that was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar this very morning that deals with the exact same question (Jan. 16, 2014, and Her, for the record). And maybe Alvarez, turning in his first feature, thought the story resonated more because it asks the same question with older tech (the relationship is carried on entirely by phone). That is important given an hour and a half long movie based on a four-page magazine article, because you've got to have something to fill up all that time before you get to the Big Twist(TM). Once you get past the gimmick and just see it as a relationship drama, things start cruising pretty smoothly again, but...then there's that Big Twist(TM). And when you put something like that out there, whether you filmed the truth or not, you're making a fictional piece based on a true story, and when you are doing that, it's worth considering that perhaps the true ending wasn't the right one. Your mileage may certainly vary, but to me, it wasn't, especially with the way Alvarez lensed that whole sequence&#8212;it's obvious to me that even he wanted the ending we didn't get. Did he feel constrained by the subject matter? That's the only explanation I can come up with.Balancing this out are some very good performances. Geraghty reminds us why we like him in military-movie roles, if you soured on him after watching ATM. O'Neill makes a good comic foil, and even the minor parts are generally well-cast. If only Alvarez had had someone to slap some sense into him about that last sequence... ** ",3,"""First you make a stone of your heart...""",1392940800,"02 21, 2014",2014,3999,"['Easier', 'Practice', 'Kyle', 'Patrick', 'Alvarez', '2009', 'lot', 'Easier', 'Practice', 'like', 'really', 'kind', 'story', 'stranger', 'sitting', 'next', 'bar', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'struck', 'up', 'conversation', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'TV', 'turned', 'baseball', 'yet', 'again', 'tells', 'blue', 'order', 'get', 'off', 'chest', 'feeling', 'film', 'realm', 'very', 'well', 'least', 'picture', 'problem', 'story', 'get', 'very', 'distinct', 'feeling', 'perhaps', 'nice', 'guy', 'sitting', 'next', 'maybe', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'nice', 'may', 'have', 'first', 'seemed', 'Now', 'entirely', 'possible', 'paint', 'good', 'light', '8212', 'being', 'as', 'honest', 'can', 'be', 'feelings', 'reactions', 'situation', 'therapist', 'worth', 'salt', 'will', 'tell', 'ca', ""n't"", 'effectively', 'process', 'sort', 'stuff', 'being', 'entirely', 'honest', 'other', 'hand', 'when', 'show', 'outsiders', 'people', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'urge', 'whitewash', 'things', 'make', 'look', 'better', 'sometimes', 'best', 'followed', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'changed', 'ending', 'story', 'here', 'irrelevant', 'open', 'Davy', 'Mitchell', 'ATM', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'budding', 'novelist', 'media', 'most', 'depressing', 'book', 'tour', 'brother', 'Sean', 'Pulse', 'Kel', ""O'Neill"", ""'ve"", 'financed', 'entire', 'thing', ""'re"", 'halfway', 'country', ""'re"", 'near-broke', ""'re"", 'not', 'selling', 'anything', 'trunkful', 'books', 'side', 'note', 'movie', 'based', 'GQ', 'article', 'Davy', 'Rothbart', 'who', 'had', 'version', 'story', 'actually', 'happen', 'was', 'touring', 'Found', 'exactly', 'found', 'bit', 'most', 'believable', 'part', 'story', 'reading', 'somewhere', 'where', 'book', 'title', 'link', 'review', 'Found', 'One', 'night', 'generic', 'nameless', 'motel', 'call', 'breathy-voiced', 'Nicole', 'Black', 'Rock', 'Katie', 'Aselton', 'have', 'phone', 'sex', 'eventually', 'relationship', 'Nicole', 'meet', 'Davy', 'flesh', 'question', '8212', 'can', 'have', 'relationship', 'someone', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'One', 'movie', 'problems', 'question', 'been', 'kind', 'ridiculous', 'one', 'oh', 'two', 'three', 'years', 'world', 'wide', 'web', 'went', 'global', 'too', 'young', 'remember', 'happened', '1993', 'Which', 'not', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'still', 'be', 'asked', '8212', 'movie', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'very', 'morning', 'deals', 'exact', 'same', 'question', 'Jan.', '16', '2014', 'Her', 'record', 'maybe', 'Alvarez', 'turning', 'first', 'feature', 'thought', 'story', 'resonated', 'more', 'same', 'question', 'older', 'tech', 'relationship', 'carried', 'entirely', 'phone', 'important', 'given', 'hour', 'half', 'long', 'movie', 'based', 'four-page', 'magazine', 'article', ""'ve"", 'got', 'have', 'something', 'fill', 'up', 'time', 'get', 'Big', 'Twist', 'TM', 'Once', 'get', 'gimmick', 'just', 'see', 'relationship', 'drama', 'things', 'start', 'cruising', 'pretty', 'smoothly', 'again', 'then', 'Big', 'Twist', 'TM', 'when', 'put', 'something', 'there', 'filmed', 'truth', 'not', ""'re"", 'making', 'fictional', 'piece', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'when', 'are', 'doing', 'worth', 'considering', 'perhaps', 'true', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'right', 'one', 'mileage', 'may', 'certainly', 'vary', 'was', ""n't"", 'especially', 'way', 'Alvarez', 'lensed', 'whole', 'sequence', '8212', 'obvious', 'even', 'wanted', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Did', 'feel', 'constrained', 'subject', 'matter', 'only', 'explanation', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'with.Balancing', 'out', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'Geraghty', 'why', 'like', 'military-movie', 'roles', 'soured', 'watching', 'ATM', ""O'Neill"", 'good', 'comic', 'foil', 'even', 'minor', 'parts', 'are', 'generally', 'well-cast', 'only', 'Alvarez', 'had', 'had', 'someone', 'slap', 'sense', 'last', 'sequence', '**']",Easier with Practice

This unglamorous trip consists primarily of giving readings to unenthused audiences at book stores throughout the southwest.  While in Gallup, New Mexico, Davy is relaxing in his hotel room when he receives an unexpected phone call.  A woman identifies herself as Nicole and says that she wants to have phone sex.  The somewhat dweebish and socially inept Davy at first is hesitant to play along.  However, when he reluctantly has phone sex with Nicole, he finds that he enjoys it, leading to a series of calls.  Soon, he considers Nicole to be his girlfriend, even though they have never met or even exchanged pictures.  He begins to want more.""Easier with Practice"" is a terrific indie gem that explores modern day alienation.  When he's surrounded by people, Davy feels alone and overwhelmed; only by escaping through his cell phone calls to a basically anonymous woman can he feel a connection to someone.  Gotta love modern day technology and the changes it brings to social relationships!  The movie is anchored by a first-rate performance by Brian Geraghty (""The Hurt Locker""), who successfully captures the loneliness and social awkwardness of this character.  The normally baby-faced actor sports a beard and glasses, and this physical transformation allows the normally handsome actor to morph into his character.  More importantly, Geraghty isn't afraid of appearing vulnerable and even pathetic at times, which allows the somewhat strange story to feel complete believable.  It's truly compelling and award-worthy acting.First time director and co-writer, Kyle Patrick Alvarez, does some nice subtle work here.  Keeping the direction and story simple really works for the film.  The screenplay was written by Alvarez based on an at-least-somewhat-true story that appeared in GQ Magazine and written by Davy Rothbart (editor and publisher of the fascinating Found Magazine).  However, don't let the somewhat questionable source material scare you away; ""Easier with Practice"" is an original, funny, and at times heart-breaking story.
