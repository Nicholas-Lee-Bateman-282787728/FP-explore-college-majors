Both are Christmastime stories of angels sent to help someone, and both feature little Karolyn Grimes as the main characters' child. (""Look, Daddy! Teacher says, every time a bell rings an angel gets his wings."")""The Bishop's Wife"" is Loretta Young. Her husband, Bishop Henry Brougham (David Niven) is trying to raise funds for a cathedral, but he's confounded by Mrs. Hamilton (Gladys Cooper), a curt, wealthy widow and primary donor who wants the edifice to be a memorial to the late Mr. Hamilton. When Henry prays for Divine guidance, an angel named Dudley (Cary Grant) appears.A side story concerns Prof. Wutheridge, delightfully portrayed by Monty Woolley. He's an aging, atheistic historian with a severe case of writer's block (been working on the same history of Rome for 20 years).Dudley gets involved in everyone's life, bringing joy to all he comes in contact with except the man who conjured him up, the bishop.

It was brought to my attention as the one on which Whitney Houston's terrific ""The Preacher's Wife"" was based. The story is somewhat similar, but the style is altogether different. For one thing, this one is lily white.Bishop Henry Brougham (David Niven), who is presumably an Episcopalian, has a beautiful wife Julia (Loretta Young) who loves him enough that she is concerned with how obsessed he has become. He's supposedly building a cathedral, and must kow-tow to the wealthy of the parish in order to do it. In fact, when he finally prays about it, he does not say ""help me build the cathedral"" but ""give me guidance."" And that's exactly what he gets, in the person of an angel named Dudley (Cary Grant). Not, however, to help him build the cathedral, but to improve his relationship to his wife and the ordinary people instead of the high power society snobs.There's quite a lot of religion in it, of course, but not enough to turn off this hard-core old atheist. The only thing that really annoyed me was a lovable agnostic, Professor Wutheridge, who ends up in church after Dudley works his magic. Ah well, it's fiction.It's a charming movie, if not terribly deep.

Most of the main characters in this movie have a problem with focusing in what should be important to them.

Mrs. Hamilton (Gladys Cooper), who holds the purse strings, is thinking the cathedral is more of a monument to her late husband. Even an angel named Dudley (Grant), sent to help, gets sidetracked in the process by the bishop's wife, Julia (Young) who in turn may be distracted by a hat.

302535,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6302227127,Bobby Underwood,"[90, 97]","This genlte film, based on Robert Nathan's fine story, has the warmth of a cup of hot cider by the fireplace during a cold December day. There is something quiet and magical about it, like the hush of the world when it snows. Cary Grant and Loretta Young are a joy to watch together, their easy chemistry as welcome as popcorn balls and candy canes.Directed by Henry Koster, with some nice photography from Gregg Toland, the screenplay by Robert E. Sherwood and Leonardo Bercovici captures perfectly the sentimental fantasy feel of all Robert Nathan's fine work. Cary Grant convinced producer Samuel Goldwyn to let him portray the role of Dudley rather than the bishop, and after seeing this film, it would be difficult to imagine it any other way.Cary Grant always made everything look easy, but just how much work went into that illusion is exemplified by this film. Before shooting began, Grant could not ice skate, play the harp, or speak any French. By the time ""The Bishop's Wife"" was finished shooting, he could do all three. It was truly an accomplishment of heavenly preportions. The film itself was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Picture, and received another nomination for Best Director.Henry Brogham (David Niven) is a newly appointed Episcopalian bishop trying to secure funds for a big cathedral he wants to build. He is selling out little by little to the demands of Mrs. Hamilton (Gladys Cooper), who helped get him his appointment and has the money he needs to make his dream come true. But he has forgotten about his wife's happiness in his quest to build the massive church, and when he prays for direction from God, he gets more than he bargained for.Cary Grant is the Angel, Dudley, who's been sent to help out. Cars stop for him and he knows the name of everyone he meets before they tell him. Dudley is quiet and charming, and very handsome. He has an easy way about him that makes everyone happy. Henry's maid, Matilda (Elsa Lanchester), is taken with him and he has a gentle effect on everyone he comes in contact with. Henry is not as ecstatic about Dudley, however, since one of those people is his neglected wife, Julia (Loretta Young).Young looks beautiful framed by Gregg Toland's soft focus photography, and is marvelous as the sweet woman who misses the time Henry spent with she and their daughter, Debby (Karolyn Grimes), before he obtained his appointment. Dudley and Julia begin to enjoy the small and wonderful things a couple in love should share together, while Henry continues to fret over the cathedral. Henry has forgotten that he prayed for guidance, not a big church.It is snowing all through this film, and there are many sweet moments between Dudley and Julia. Just the simple pleasure of a walk down the street and having lunch at a familiar place are given back to Julia, as she is made to feel appreciated again. She finally splurges and buys the hat she's been staring at through the shop window for weeks. It is a moment of self-worth, restored by Dudley's attention. There is a magical ice-skating scene as Dudley makes it possible for Julia to glide like an old hand over the ice.There is humor as well, Dudley making Debby's snowballs hit their mark. He also gives Sylvester (James Gleason), the cab driver, the ability to skate. Dudley explains to Julia that the only people who grow old are those who are born old, but if you are born young, you will stay that way. Dudley and Julia restore Sylvester's faith in people.Dudley's gentle effect on people, however, is not limited to Julia. His visit to Mrs. Hamilton will reveal a secret love from her past and change her plans for Henry's cathedral. His visit with Julia's friend, Professor Wutheridge (Monty Woolley), will inspire him to write his book and understand what he could not before. And all the time he is spending with Julia and Debby may make Henry angry enough to realize what is really important, if it is not too late.There is a tender charm to this heartwarming classic.

It is somewhat of a shame to see David Niven stuck in a part that doesn't allow him much room for humour, as he can be so funny.  And I do have to admit that Loretta Young's allure alludes me somewhat.  She doesn't seem very dynamic for two men (or should I say a man and an angel) to be making such a fuss over.

The bishop is beginning to lose faith and believes his marriage is failing. Dudley restores his faith, and brings happiness back to the marriage, but the new church remains unbuilt.Cary Grant and Loretta Young starred in two films: BORN TO BE BAD in 1934 and thirteen years later, THE BISHOP'S WIFE. This picture was nominated for Best Picture in 1947, but lost to GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT. This is Cary Grant's 51st film and his second in 1947. THE BISHOP'S WIFE was remade into THE PREACHER'S WIFE in 1996, starring Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston.THE BISHOP'S WIFE is the story of Julia Brougham and Henry Brougham, played by Loretta Young and David Niven, respectfully. Henry, plays an Episcopalian bishop, who is all caught up with building a new cathedral for his church and has forgotten about his wife, Julia. Henry wishes that he could have some help with the financing his project and prays to God for assistance.In comes Dudley, Cary Grant, an angel, who has been sent to honor his wishes. Dudley then decides he will work for Henry as his assistant, but in reality decides to spend a lot of time with Julia to make her happy, which infuriates Henry.However, in the end, Dudley disappears forever from their lives after accomplishing all he came to do. It turns out that an old rare coin given to Julia by Professor Wutheridge, Monty Woolley, is worth a fortune and the new cathedral can be built after all. Julia and Henry get back together and are much happier because Dudley has shown them the way.Cary Grant has an awful lot of talent in this movie. With his acrobatic ability, he relearned how to ice skate; his musical ability lead him to play the harp, and this of course was not one of his funny films. This was a serious role for Cary and it turned out very well. Variety review of November 19, 1947, states, ""Cary Grant is the angel of the piece and has never appeared to greater advantage.""",5,The Bishop's Wife,1048291200,"03 22, 2003",2003,2051,"['Plot', 'Dudley', 'angel', 'who', 'help', 'bishop', 'answer', 'Bishop', 'prayer', 'help', 'getting', 'funds', 'new', 'cathedral', 'bishop', 'beginning', 'lose', 'faith', 'marriage', 'failing', 'Dudley', 'faith', 'happiness', 'back', 'marriage', 'new', 'church', 'unbuilt.Cary', 'Grant', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'starred', 'two', 'films', 'BORN', 'TO', 'BE', 'BAD', '1934', 'thirteen', 'years', 'later', 'THE', 'BISHOP', 'WIFE', 'picture', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', '1947', 'lost', 'GENTLEMAN', 'AGREEMENT', 'Cary', 'Grant', '51st', 'film', 'second', '1947', 'BISHOP', 'WIFE', 'was', 'remade', 'THE', 'PREACHER', 'WIFE', '1996', 'starring', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Whitney', 'Houston.THE', 'BISHOP', 'WIFE', 'story', 'Julia', 'Brougham', 'Henry', 'Brougham', 'played', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'David', 'Niven', 'respectfully', 'Henry', 'Episcopalian', 'bishop', 'who', 'caught', 'up', 'building', 'new', 'cathedral', 'church', 'forgotten', 'wife', 'Julia', 'Henry', 'could', 'have', 'help', 'financing', 'project', 'prays', 'God', 'assistance.In', 'Dudley', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'angel', 'who', 'been', 'sent', 'honor', 'wishes', 'Dudley', 'then', 'will', 'work', 'Henry', 'assistant', 'reality', 'decides', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'Julia', 'make', 'happy', 'Henry.However', 'end', 'Dudley', 'forever', 'lives', 'accomplishing', 'came', 'do', 'out', 'old', 'rare', 'coin', 'given', 'Julia', 'Professor', 'Wutheridge', 'Monty', 'Woolley', 'fortune', 'new', 'cathedral', 'can', 'be', 'built', 'Julia', 'Henry', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'are', 'much', 'happier', 'Dudley', 'shown', 'way.Cary', 'Grant', 'awful', 'lot', 'talent', 'movie', 'acrobatic', 'ability', 'relearned', 'how', 'ice', 'skate', 'musical', 'ability', 'lead', 'play', 'harp', 'course', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'funny', 'films', 'was', 'serious', 'role', 'Cary', 'turned', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'Variety', 'review', 'November', '19', '1947', 'states', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'angel', 'piece', 'never', 'appeared', 'greater', 'advantage']",N/A

If I did get one, the stamp would certainly be worth saving.That's because Dudley (Cary Grant) is an angel sent to give guidance to forlorn Bishop Henry Brougham (David Niven), and who eventually lights up the lives of everyone else in the Bishop's life, especially The Bishop's Wife in this delightful Christmas film from 1947. When the Bishop prays for help in getting a new cathedral built (the local millionairess widow will only give if her late husband's name is prominently displayed), Cary Grant shows up as his &quot;assistant&quot; but soon makes the Bishop even more miserable by charming his wife Julia (radiant Loretta Young), daughter Debby, and even housemaid Matilda (Elsa Lanchester, always wonderful).The Bishop's Wife is truly &quot;heavenly&quot; with Grant playing off his tried-and-true persona. Originally Grant and Niven were supposed to have the opposite roles, but Grant decided he could do more with the angel role -- and Grant was a bigger star -- so they were exchanged. Good thing, too: I can't imagine Cary playing the indecisive Bishop any more than I can imagine Niven charming a woman away from Cary Grant.Only a few things keep The Bishop's Wife from being perfect. There is an overlong ice-skating scene that really stretches the believability (I had to keep telling myself &quot;he's an angel; he can do anything), and the film runs on about twenty minutes too long. In the beginning, Grant is so taken by Young that, if he weren't an angel, those looks would feel really sleazy. Turns out that Cary is just discovering temptations, which makes the ending all the more noble.Watching The Bishop's Wife in June (during a Cary Grant festival on Turner Classic Movies) is a little strange, but the movie is so ... happy that it's easy to slip into the vibe, especially with all the Christmas carols being bandied about like so many candy canes. I'd certainly recommend that fans of the stars watch it at least once (especially since Loretta Young, whom I don't find all that attractive, is made, through Gregg Toland's photography, into a very appealing woman). Niven is rather on the milquetoasty side and his richest scene involves him being stuck in a chair, but the rest of the film is two hours of Christmas joy.",4,Charming but overlong,1087516800,"06 18, 2004",2004,2316,"['Bishop', 'Are', 'expecting', 'letter', 'Dudley', 'Well', 'never', 'know', 'did', 'get', 'one', 'stamp', 'would', 'certainly', 'be', 'worth', 'saving.That', 'Dudley', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'angel', 'sent', 'give', 'guidance', 'forlorn', 'Bishop', 'Henry', 'Brougham', 'David', 'Niven', 'who', 'eventually', 'up', 'lives', 'everyone', 'else', 'Bishop', 'life', 'especially', 'Bishop', 'Wife', 'delightful', 'Christmas', 'film', '1947', 'When', 'Bishop', 'help', 'getting', 'new', 'cathedral', 'built', 'local', 'millionairess', 'widow', 'will', 'only', 'give', 'late', 'husband', 'name', 'prominently', 'displayed', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'up', 'quot', 'assistant', 'quot', 'soon', 'Bishop', 'even', 'more', 'miserable', 'charming', 'wife', 'Julia', 'radiant', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'daughter', 'Debby', 'even', 'housemaid', 'Matilda', 'Elsa', 'Lanchester', 'always', 'wonderful', '.The', 'Bishop', 'Wife', 'truly', 'quot', 'heavenly', 'quot', 'Grant', 'playing', 'off', 'tried-and-true', 'persona', 'Originally', 'Grant', 'Niven', 'were', 'supposed', 'have', 'opposite', 'roles', 'Grant', 'decided', 'could', 'do', 'more', 'angel', 'role', 'Grant', 'was', 'bigger', 'star', 'were', 'exchanged', 'Good', 'thing', 'too', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'Cary', 'playing', 'indecisive', 'Bishop', 'more', 'can', 'imagine', 'Niven', 'charming', 'woman', 'away', 'Cary', 'Grant.Only', 'few', 'things', 'keep', 'Bishop', 'Wife', 'being', 'perfect', 'overlong', 'ice-skating', 'scene', 'really', 'believability', 'had', 'keep', 'telling', 'quot', 'angel', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'film', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'beginning', 'Grant', 'so', 'taken', 'Young', 'were', ""n't"", 'angel', 'looks', 'would', 'feel', 'really', 'sleazy', 'out', 'Cary', 'just', 'discovering', 'temptations', 'ending', 'more', 'noble.Watching', 'Bishop', 'Wife', 'June', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'festival', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'little', 'strange', 'movie', 'so', 'happy', 'easy', 'slip', 'vibe', 'especially', 'Christmas', 'carols', 'being', 'bandied', 'so', 'many', 'candy', 'canes', ""'d"", 'certainly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'stars', 'watch', 'least', 'once', 'especially', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'whom', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'attractive', 'made', 'Gregg', 'Toland', 'photography', 'very', 'appealing', 'woman', 'Niven', 'rather', 'milquetoasty', 'side', 'richest', 'scene', 'being', 'stuck', 'chair', 'rest', 'film', 'two', 'hours', 'Christmas', 'joy']",N/A

Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven make up an impressive trio of stars, but Grant has the best role. He makes the best of it, too, with expressions on his face that are funnier than most of the lines he delivers.One not-so-family oriented thing he does, however, as the ""angel,"" is go out on dates with the bishop's wife (Young). No respectable married woman, especially back then, would ever do that. At least the two of them recognize this fact later.

302574,A31LHED3SKLWVB,6302227127,Darren,"[3, 10]","While Frank Capra did not direct ""The Bishop's Wife"", it's worth reflecting on that old pejorative ""Capra-corn"". I think the term is unfair. The characters in Capra's movies -- usually working men -- often gave painfully earnest speeches, but it's hard to see how ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is any more cornball than this holiday turkey. In fact, ""Wonderful Life"" is a rather intense film that tackles some pretty existential questions for a movie that has an angel in it. If all that, and Potterville too, is a bit much for you, then ""The Bishop's Wife"" might be a nice alternative -- no existential questions here. The angel in this one takes care of everything.The main thing he has to take care of is the unhappy wife of an Episcopalian bishop. Summoned to earth by David Niven who is trying to get a rather ghastly-looking cathedral (if the painting is any guide) built, Cary Grant's first order of business is to take bored-stiff Loretta Young to lunch at a nice French restaurant. Other dates follow. It gets to the point that whenever Niven arrives home from his endless committee meetings, he discovers that his wife and ""Dudley"" are out on the town. There's a scene where Niven visits an old moneybags, but he's intending to leave quickly in order to join Grant and Young at his old church in order to listen to a boys' choir. Grant -- clever devil -- attaches Niven's fanny to the chair he's sitting in so that he can't leave the house. Grant and Young go on to have a wonderful evening without Niven that includes a romantic bout of ice skating. Niven can only seethe about all this, because he knows Grant is an angel, but Grant has told no one else. Young, meanwhile, is enthralled, because Cary Grant.One can only speculate about the message, here. Husbands: pay more attention to your wives.--I guess that's one of the main points. However, I'm not sure it needs an angel from Heaven sweeping the lady off her feet to illustrate that point. Sometimes, the pool boy suffices. But I'm more puzzled by the novel take on Christian doctrine illustrated by the film. Grant's angel removes human agency and free will from the characters, utilizing cheap magic tricks to guide events towards the presumably desirable goal. Grant's ideas about what should be done about the cathedral are the ones that come to fruition, not Niven's. The angel helps an old classics professor ""without religion"" write a book by angelically planting the ideas in his head. This professor also ends up at church at film's end ... but with no memory of why he feels he should be going to church. Grant tells the Bishop's little girl the story about David and the lion, emphasizing how David's defeat of the lion was inspired by angelic agency, because, after all, ""angels give people all kinds of good ideas, and then the people think that it was their own ideas!"" In this movie's version of Christianity, free will doesn't exist. We're merely pieces on a board to be moved at the whims of angels.  Even the bishop's final sermon to his congregation was written by the angel.Anyway, it's impossible to give a 1 star rating to a movie that has both Cary Grant and David Niven in it. In fact, the best parts of the film are when they're jousting together: Niven sputtering with frustration, Grant grinning in his unflappable way. The best comic bit is a running gag where these two wicked old pros have a silent little war about whom should precede the other through an open door.

David Niven does admirable work as the uptight bishop who cannot see the forest for the trees.  Loretta Young, on the other hand, gives a performance akin to a cigar store Indian.  Master cinematographer Gregg Toland films her in soft focus to show emotion and passion that are otherwise absent in her performance as the frustrated bishop's wife.

302589,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6302227127,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","Released by producer Samuel Goldwyn as a feel-good follow-up to his postwar classic,The Best Years of Our Lives, this 1947 film amounts to nice, warm-hearted Christmas fare which takes a subtle jab at organized religion in face of pure faith. Written by Leonardo Bercovici and Robert E. Sherwood (who pennedThe Best Years of Our Lives), the plot concerns Henry Brougham, a young, well-intentioned bishop who has set the goal of building a big cathedral in his parish but cannot convince his rich patrons to give him the financial backing to build it. Praying for guidance, he is startled by the appearance of Dudley, who turns out to be an angel sent to lend Henry a helping hand in realizing his dream. The rest of the movie focuses on how Dudley teaches Henry and his put-upon wife Julia what happiness really means.Originally, Cary Grant and David Niven were cast as Henry and Dudley respectively, but they switched roles upon Goldwyn's insistence when he fired the original director. Under Henry Koster's direction, the film has the necessary whimsical tone, and the casting switch turns out to be fruitful. Grant is an uncomplicated charmer as Dudley, while Niven applies just the right amount of envy-driven starch and humility as Henry. As Julia, Loretta Young can be sweetly affecting, but as written, the character is rather dull considering how both men appear to vie for her affections. A strong supporting cast helps add texture to the story - Gladys Cooper (My Fair Lady) as rich, ruthless Mrs. Hamilton, the Scrooge figure who wants the cathedral to become a memorial to her dead husband; Monty Woolley (The Man Who Came to Dinner) as agnostic Professor Wutheridge; Elsa Lanchester (Witness For the Prosecution) as dotty housekeeper Matilda; and James Gleason (Here Comes Mr. Jordan) as kind-hearted cabbie Sylvester.Some scenes are intentionally fanciful, especially those that showcase Dudley's preternatural abilities on the ice rink and with a harp. However, you just have to let go of such contrivances for the sake of the fantasy aspects of the tale. That's why the movie plays much better during the holidays when wishful thinking becomes near-epidemic. It's also the type of movie that elicits warm chuckles rather than outright guffaws and as such, seems perilously long at 109 minutes. Also worth mentioning are the crisp black-and-white cinematography by Gregg Toland (Citizen Kane) and the stirring, inspirational score by composer Hugo Friedhofer.

It is very sweet, and features wonderful performances from three classic stars.Essentially, The Bishop's Wife is the story of a bishop (David Niven) who becomes overly obsessed with getting funds for a new cathedral and subsequently neglects his wife and the things that really count. After he prays for help with his project, an angel named Dudley (Cary Grant), arrives to make him see that really counts in his life and to entertain his wife (Loretta Young).An interesting fact about this movie is that, after the initial script was found too dull, several expert writers were brought in (uncredited) to improve the movie. And it worked, because this movie has many good lines and scenes. Most importantly, however, this movie depends on the great performances of its stars. Cary Grant is really the only actor who could have made a role like Dudley seem realistic and interesting, and he pulls it off with his characteristic style, elegance, and charm. Like in all his roles, he plays this one effortlessly and just right. Niven is excellent as the stressed out bishop, and Loretta Young does a nice job as the neglected wife.

McElroy,"[2, 2]","Noise suppressors have been applied to the default soundtrack with the usual, highly predictable results: clipped, abrupt speech (the noise suppressors accelerate the natural decline in volume of spoken words); loss of low-level audio detail and background ambience; and background sounds which increase and decrease depending on the volume of the foreground. I have described these defects more fully in other reviews and they're all on display in the default soundtrack of this title.What makes ""The Bishop's Wife"" more interesting than the usual classic DVD with damaged audio is that an unaltered original track is included as a choice. In that track, the dynamic range is less, of course, but speech is natural and easy to understand, and normal background sounds are intact and make an effective setting for the foreground action.The side effects of noise suppressors are glaringly obvious but I suspect many people have the mistaken impression that the problems are in the original soundtracks of classic films because of their age. Not so. Older films had excellent audio despite lacking the dynamic range of modern films. My personal choice is for an intelligible soundtrack presented as the film's creators intended it to be. In this DVD of ""The Bishop's Wife,"" those in charge at least had the good sense to provide the original, unmangled soundtrack as an option.

302607,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6302227127,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","For a Christmas classic long on charm, the 1947 THE BISHOP'S WIFE had a remarkably troubled history. When the film originally went before the cameras it starred noted actress and Academy award winner Teresa Wright in the title role with co-stars Cary Grant as the Bishop and David Niven as a slightly wayward angel--but somewhere along the way Wright ran afoul of director William Seiter, who, for reasons that have never been clearly explained, fired her. This in turn brought down the wrath of producer Samuel Goldwyn, who looked at the film, didn't like what he saw, and fired Seiter.Goldwyn brought in director Henry Koster, who looked at the film and very strongly felt that Grant and Niven were in the wrong roles--and it took some time and effort to convince the two to make the change. Then, by the time shooting was set to resume, Wright was visibly pregnant and was replaced by Loretta Young. In consequence of these changes, there wasn't a scrap of film that could be salvaged from the original footage, so the film restarted from scratch at enormous cost. As a result, and although it was well received and did good box office, THE BISHOP'S WIFE was never the great financial hit Goldwyn had hoped: it was so deeply in the red before it opened that even the best attendance couldn't do more than recoup its cost.The story is simple but charming. Episcopal Bishop Henry Brougham (David Niven) has become so consumed by the wordly demands of building a new and very expensive church that he has effectively lost touch with his faith--and, not incidently, his wife Julia (Loretta Young), who is increasingly unhappy in the marriage and therefore presumably open to temptation. Their difficulties come to a head as Christmas approaches, but to their good fortune they are visited by an angel with the improbable name of Dudley (Cary Grant.) Handsome, suave, and able to show Julia a good time, Dudley soon incurs Henry's jealousy, and through this Henry comes to appreciate Julia and rediscovers his own spirituality.Like most Christmas-oriented films of its era, THE BISHOP'S WIFE is less about serious theological issues than it is about whimsey, and while some may consider the result shallow it is nonetheless a truly charming bit of Christmas cheer. The three leads are memorable, with Grant a standout as the slightly devilish angel, and they are strongly supported by the very entertaining performances of Monty Wooley, Gladys Cooper, and Elsa Lanchester. The script is witty, the direction even if not greatly inspired, and the whole thing adds up to a highly entertaining two hours.THE BISHOP'S WIFE was remade in 1996 as THE PREACHER'S WIFE, but the result was lackluster; gentle charm is not among the strengths of modern Hollywood. As for the DVD release of the original, it is at best so-so; the transfer is on the dark side, a fact that tends to take the edge off the film's emotional brightness. Even so, recommended just for the fun you'll have watching three of Hollywood's classic players execute a lightweight script with considerable grace and, yes, Christmas charm.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,Christmas Charm,1197676800,"12 15, 2007",2007,3114,"['Christmas', 'classic', 'long', 'charm', '1947', 'THE', 'BISHOP', 'WIFE', 'had', 'remarkably', 'troubled', 'history', 'When', 'film', 'originally', 'went', 'cameras', 'starred', 'noted', 'actress', 'Academy', 'award', 'winner', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'title', 'role', 'co-stars', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Bishop', 'David', 'Niven', 'slightly', 'wayward', 'angel', 'somewhere', 'way', 'Wright', 'ran', 'afoul', 'director', 'William', 'Seiter', 'who', 'reasons', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'clearly', 'explained', 'fired', 'turn', 'brought', 'down', 'wrath', 'producer', 'Samuel', 'Goldwyn', 'who', 'looked', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'what', 'saw', 'fired', 'Seiter.Goldwyn', 'brought', 'director', 'Henry', 'Koster', 'who', 'looked', 'film', 'very', 'strongly', 'felt', 'Grant', 'Niven', 'were', 'wrong', 'roles', 'took', 'time', 'effort', 'convince', 'two', 'make', 'change', 'Then', 'time', 'shooting', 'was', 'set', 'resume', 'Wright', 'was', 'visibly', 'pregnant', 'was', 'replaced', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'consequence', 'changes', 'was', ""n't"", 'scrap', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'salvaged', 'original', 'footage', 'film', 'restarted', 'scratch', 'enormous', 'cost', 'result', 'was', 'well', 'received', 'did', 'good', 'box', 'office', 'THE', 'BISHOP', 'WIFE', 'was', 'never', 'great', 'financial', 'hit', 'Goldwyn', 'had', 'hoped', 'was', 'so', 'deeply', 'red', 'opened', 'even', 'best', 'attendance', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'more', 'recoup', 'cost.The', 'story', 'simple', 'charming', 'Episcopal', 'Bishop', 'Henry', 'Brougham', 'David', 'Niven', 'become', 'so', 'consumed', 'wordly', 'demands', 'building', 'new', 'very', 'expensive', 'church', 'effectively', 'lost', 'touch', 'faith', 'not', 'incidently', 'wife', 'Julia', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'who', 'increasingly', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'therefore', 'presumably', 'open', 'temptation', 'difficulties', 'come', 'head', 'Christmas', 'approaches', 'good', 'fortune', 'are', 'visited', 'angel', 'improbable', 'name', 'Dudley', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Handsome', 'suave', 'able', 'show', 'Julia', 'good', 'time', 'Dudley', 'soon', 'Henry', 'jealousy', 'Henry', 'appreciate', 'Julia', 'rediscovers', 'own', 'spirituality.Like', 'most', 'Christmas-oriented', 'films', 'era', 'THE', 'BISHOP', 'WIFE', 'less', 'serious', 'theological', 'issues', 'whimsey', 'may', 'consider', 'result', 'shallow', 'nonetheless', 'truly', 'charming', 'bit', 'Christmas', 'cheer', 'three', 'leads', 'are', 'memorable', 'Grant', 'standout', 'slightly', 'devilish', 'angel', 'are', 'strongly', 'supported', 'very', 'entertaining', 'performances', 'Monty', 'Wooley', 'Gladys', 'Cooper', 'Elsa', 'Lanchester', 'script', 'witty', 'direction', 'even', 'not', 'greatly', 'inspired', 'whole', 'thing', 'up', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'two', 'hours.THE', 'BISHOP', 'WIFE', 'was', 'remade', '1996', 'THE', 'PREACHER', 'WIFE', 'result', 'was', 'lackluster', 'gentle', 'charm', 'not', 'strengths', 'modern', 'Hollywood', 'DVD', 'release', 'original', 'best', 'so-so', 'transfer', 'dark', 'side', 'fact', 'take', 'edge', 'film', 'emotional', 'brightness', 'Even', 'so', 'recommended', 'just', 'fun', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watching', 'three', 'Hollywood', 'classic', 'players', 'execute', 'lightweight', 'script', 'considerable', 'grace', 'yes', 'Christmas', 'charm.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

Just plain tremendous!Cary Grant as the angel Dudley is a bit devil, but he does not deviate from his mission, even though, he develops ""feelings"" for the beautiful, graceful, and talented Loretta Young.  Loretta Young plays Julia Brougham to perfection, the patient, loving wife of David Niven, an Episcopal Bishop.David Niven's Henry Brougham is a man with a driving passion.  Unfortunately, his passion is not for his lovely wife, but his desire is to build a magnificent cathedral in this postwar town.The season of the year is Christmas.  It seems at least in the movies that miraculous things happen at this time of the year.The town looks like a Norman Rockwell painting with snow, trees, ice skating, the Robert Mitchell Boy Choir and music even to make a Grinch steal back to his hole.  Of course, you have to have a rich person who holds the keys to Bishop Brougham's dreams--so he thinks.One of the best scenes is when Dudley takes Julia and Sylvester, their cab driver, ice skating--really ice dancing. It is priceless.  It's fun to watch.Overall this film is a great Christmas present because it brings back a time when life's problems could be solved by a simple miracle.  The black and white noir is just fine.  Gather your family around and watch this delightful fantasy.It was nominated for five Oscars, including Best Picture.  It won the Oscar for Best Sound.

302613,A1S1JC7LTBZAH2,6302227127,Hal Jordan,"[2, 2]","In some ways, the late 1940s were more of a Hollywood Golden Age than were the 1930s.  This film was made in 1947, just a couple of years before the explosive growth of television and the federal government's antitrust suit against the big studios combined to change Hollywood forever.  Cary Grant was, of course, one of Hollywood's biggest stars and to my mind this is one of his top two or three films.  Although not a typical role in that he is playing an angel, he is still very much the suave, debonair leading man.  In fact, if you know someone too young to have seen Cary, this film would be a great way to introduce him.  The plot is imaginative and the acting is excellent.  This film makes for wonderful Christmas Eve viewing.  If there is one problem, the special effects are a bit crude, even for the late 1940s.  In particular, the extended scene at the skating rink employs obvious doubles for Grant, Loretta Young, and James Gleason.  Grant's double is clearly too short.  It's rather surprising that this scene is allowed to go on so long given how unconvincing it is.It's disappointing that this film is no longer available as a single DVD, although it is included in a three-pack (packaged with two much weaker films).  Interestingly, the Robert Nathan novel on which the film is based is also out of print.  Nathan wrote a number of similar fantasies -- including the book on which the Joseph Cotton/Jennifer Jones film ""A Portrait of Jenny"" is based -- but seems to have fallen completely out of fashion.

302614,A3RUMI4Y58S59,6302227127,Heaven's Hound,"[3, 5]","It's no wonder that the title of this film refers to the wife of the Bishop, played by David Niven.  Young is at the peak of her beauty; she steals every scene she's in, even from Cary Grant.  Watch her in her minimalistic acting:  she's an acting pro who practices the advice Spencer Tracey, who once loved Young, gave Burt Reynolds that in acting ""less is more.""  Whether or not you like Young, you have to admit there is a radiance to her beauty.  She is perfect for this role.  Now that her career is undergoing a re-evaluation (primarily because of the book The Star Machine), people are now taking a second look at her movies, especially those of the early 1930's.  Although TV made her into an even bigger star and a household name, many people have forgotten her many fine films.  Even in Platinum Blond, Young had top-billing, and as lovely as Jean Harlow was, it is still Young's film:  her acting and beauty shine throughout the film.  I'm glad The Bishop's Wife has become a tradition in many American families during Christmas because it's message is so appropriate.  It's a film that doesn't knock you over the head with didacticism.  Just sit back and enjoy the film, and all the other actors who also shine, including James Gleason, Elsa Lanchester, Monty Whooley, and of course, Cary Grant and David Niven.  But in this viewer's opinion, the film belongs to Loretta Young.  The camera is love with her face, and notice in every scene with Cary Grant, more light is cast upon her than the man with the top billing, Mr. Grant himself.  He made one other film with Young, and I'm sure he knew that in his scenes with Young, she'd steal the scene without doing a thing.

302624,A2QZBDTO9F5J06,6302227127,"Jack Pripusich ""Doctor Pretorius""","[0, 0]","This review is for the Warner Home Video DVD of ""The Bishop's Wife"".  The mid-forties proved to be a popular time for angels to walk among Hollywood's backlots. The review title I've chosen purposefully tips the cap to ""It's A Wonderful Life"" because ""The Bishop's Wife""  has a bit of the same flavor, and even features the child stars who played Zusu and young George Bailey from ""It's A Wonderful Life"".  As for ""The Bishop's Wife"", how can a film miss with Cary Grant, Loretta Young, and David Niven headlining?  Grant gives a special performance  as Dudley, an angel who does good, but has a bit of an edge. And can he be completely trusted?  Is Niven's discomfort whilst Grant frolics with Young justified? Hmmmm. Dudley dispenses help to the citizens, but it's often a rather tough love. Alfred Hitchcock tapped into Grant's somewhat mixed personality bag with high success as well. The supporting cast is outstanding, too. Elsa Lanchester is always a joy, and Monty Woolley, as the Professor, is superb. But perhaps it's Gladys Cooper who turns in the finest performance. Her scenes sell exquisitely her bad-first, good-later transformation, and it's all so realistic. Her chemistry with Grant is special. The DVD features excellent overall picture and sound, but there are about four moments where noticeable image flaws occur...dots across part of the screen. Some cleanup is in order. Not a deal breaker, but unfortunate morsels. You'll love the trailer...that isn't a trailer! A cool rarity. Scene selection is also included. This is a first rate Holiday movie and one of a kind.

302626,A9SIN6I9EHZF7,6302227127,James H. Rankin,"[4, 27]","There are as of today 42 reviews here of THE BISHOP'S WIFE, and while all rightly speak of the glowing warmth of this confection of whimsy, it should also be noted that other elements besides the simple story line contribute to its success. While it does feature Christmas scenes, they are not essential to the story, but merely a marketing ploy by the maker to increase theatre attendance and box office sales in what was normally a slower time of attendance.The warmth and quiet joy that so pervades the movie is due not only to fine acting, excellent direction, and lavish yet fitting sets, but also to an inspired musical score. The casting of an Angel to come to earth and help an Episcopal Bishop to ostensibly build a cathedral when funds are short, could not have been better than the one and only Cary Grant. His natural urbanity, and suave good looks and demeanor were perfect for the role. The character of 'Dudly' had to walk a narrow line between earnestness and a perfunctory fulfilling of duties and Mr. Grant easily found the exact blend of dignity with warmth. The rest of the cast is up to his caliber with David Niven the starchy Bishop, Loretta Young as the neglected wife of the title, and a first rate supporting cast, including such scene stealers as Monty Wolley as the Professor.Fantasies of this type require a very deft and light hand in order not to become maudlin and saccharine, nor so light as to have no substance. This film does have several layers of thought and director Henry Koster must be given the lion's share of credit for this. While there were five men involved in the original script and rewrites, it is the director who must primarily account for the tone of a film, and the tone here is bright and ennobling.Composer Hugo Friedhofer is perhaps the second person most responsible for the overall cohesiveness of the theme as he creates lovely melodies to compliment the various scenes. The main theme with the credits and especially that wonderfully exuberant yet polite theme for the ice skating scene are works of art in themselves and stand well along side the 'inspired' singing of the perfect harmony of the Mitchell Boy Choir in the church scene. Such 'heavenly' tones would be impossible to form in a boy's choir today in our crass day and age. It is amazing to see how much social attitudes have changed in just the short time since 1947, of which this film is a sort of time capsule.Often overlooked by the audience are the settings for the players since, like the background music, they are not supposed to intrude upon the story and actors. Here we have a wonderful set of designs, especially of the interiors, which often include ceilings in view, so that we believe that the story is taking place where intended. The fine atmosphere created of gray winter days is wonderfully offset by the lighthearted designs used in the outdoor scenes, especially the skating pond in the park. The romance of the setting even in the cold of winter causes an easy suspension of disbelief, as we must note that doubles are used for our principals while skating. Today you would have canned Rock-N-Roll with deafening amplification rather than a popular band. Instead of 'Sylvester' the cabby filled with warmth and gratitude for the beneficence of the Angel and the Bishop's wife, we find bullet-proof barriers and surly drivers.While it is nice to credit Cary Grant with the bearing of an Angel, the Biblical fact remains that no angel is recorded to have visited man in fleshly form since the Bible was completed, for that inspired Word of God is what is intended to guide us today. And it is an offense to Angels to portray them as so ""not cold and not hot"" as to imply their being incomplete, wandering, lonely creatures for whom we should have sympathy. Loretta Young was a beautiful woman, but no true Angel since after the Great Flood of Noah's day would consider ever envying a mortal or coveting his wife. This stratagem is used to create a false 'love' story in the plot to create the title character and to attract those given to the personality cult then surrounding Miss Young. This contrivance at odds with fact was created as a marketing tool to appeal to the ladies, and not with regard to Scriptural accuracy. The fact that while Jesus' birth is recorded in the Bible, but nothing like Christmas is ever mentioned there, further shows that the movie is intended as a fantasy and should be viewed only on that level. Thus the church represented in the film does not represent the accurate message of the Bible, even as the ""Shepherd's Song"" scene and the mention of Sylvester's descendents ""rising up and calling him Blessed"" is a warping of the true context of the Holy Scriptures.This film is the more remarkable today in that there are no creations anything like it (save for a sad remake), and due to the disintegration of the moral fiber of our society, there will never be any things like it in this System of Things. God wants our days to be happy and gay in the original meaning of that word, and not with the corrupted meanings so prevalent today. Watch the film for the contentment it leaves you as you envy our forebears the more innocent and at least Godly-oriented lives they cold then enjoy. During the Great Resurrection to come we will be able to welcome back to a restored Paradise Earth all the people who made this delightful film into a world then having the genuine, noncommercial atmosphere that our loving God intends for us. Seen in this light, this film is an unintentional foreshadow of some things to come!",4,"Warm And Well Done, BUT Biblically Innacurate",1038441600,"11 28, 2002",2002,5591,"['are', 'today', '42',

But strong performances from David Niven and Loretta Young make it convincing by focusing our attention on the real magic of the story: the idea that to make a heaven on earth requires only that we extend to our fellows some kindness and goodwill.A wonderful supporting cast brings that message to life. Elsa Lanchester and Sara Haden are wonderful as the Bishop's housekeeper and secretary. But its Gladys Cooper who persuades us of the magic in that sentiment. She turns the stereotype of the bitter, rich widow into a character who resonates with the bittersweet treasure of memories and the joy to be found in opening one's self to the world around her.This story has so much magic in its premise that there's little need for special effects. So it's disappointing that the director, Henry Koster, relies on some showy visual tricks. When he chooses more subtle ways to suggest the work of the supernatural, the effect is much more satisfying because it makes the wonder of the movies characters that much more plausible.Cary Grant's performance is the surprisingly weak piece in the ensemble. But one of the nice things about movie stars is that some need only walk in front of the camera to satisfy.

Loretta Young is his simple-minded wife, Julia, who puts up with him. Then there is the angel, St. Dudley aka Cary Grant. The bishop prays for an angel for help & gets Dudley.  Not exactly what he was hoping for. Dudley starts by giving Julia the attention she's been missing, squiring her around town showing her a good time, things she no longer does with the obcessed bishop. Julia falls in love with Dudley. Dudley can't fall in love with Julia because he's an angel. Or can he? The bishop is the only person that knows Dudley's an angel, feels jealous & wishes he would go back to where ever he came from.But the bishop has lost his way in his lust for a new cathedral.

302658,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,6302227127,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[5, 5]","1947 was Hollywood's second-greatest year, eclipsed only by 1939. With it's postwar optimism, it gave us GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT and MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET and THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES, among many others. This 1947 film is a holiday classic. Along with IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and A CHRISTMAS CAROL, THE BISHOP'S WIFE is required viewing for the adults at Yuletide. Of the three, THE BISHOP'S WIFE skates (almost literally) closest to the edge of year-round viewability.David Niven is Henry Brougham, the youthful, newly-installed Episcopal Bishop of a large Northeastern city. Loretta Young is his lovely wife Julia. Their marriage is heading down the road that should not be taken. It has nothing to do with love. There's plenty of that, and even passion. But Henry has become consumed by personal doubts. He owes his Bishropic to the machinations of Mrs. George Hamilton an unpleasant, demanding, but extremely wealthy widow who has promised Henry a new cathedral. She has also attached a list of vain ""ifs"" to the promise. Henry, who used to pastor at run-down St. Timothy's, is willing to do almost anything to see the new cathedral rise. Knowing that he is in thrall both to Mrs. Hamilton and to his own ego, Henry has become withdrawn, distracted and unhappy, and worst of all, distant to his wife and child.  He prays for divine intercession.Enter Dudley (Cary Grant), a suave, sophisticated, likeable and witty fellow who has a roguish sense of humor. He takes a job as Henry's assistant, but immediately informs the Bishop that he is an angel sent down in answer to his prayers. Henry is very skeptical and asks for proofs.While Henry continues to fret and worry, Dudley begins taking Julia out on the town for walks in the park, to expensive lunches, to stylish couture shops, to visit old friends, and, in a charming scene, to an ice-skating rink. Although Dudley's motives are at first angelic, he soon begins to fall in love with the Bishop's wife.While this forbidden affair of the heart is going on, Henry keeps finding himself in embarrassing situations---locked inside a room, stuck to a newly-varnished chair---and he begins to get angry at Dudley, whom, he rightly suspects, has designs on Julia and is not interested in the new cathedral. His suspicions are confirmed when a friendly cabbie asks Henry if he is the Minister who is going to marry Dudley and Julia, and then, almost in the same scene, a much-changed Mrs. George Hamilton decides to give her millions to the poor.Unlike other great Hollywood Christmas movies, THE BISHOP'S WIFE is a romance that has a very large dose of puckish humor: When crabby Mrs. George Hamilton wants a stained glass window of St. George Slaying The Dragon to ""suggest"" her late husband's face, Henry asks ""And whose face should the dragon suggest?"" When an old friend of Julia's serves some rather poor sherry from a near-empty bottle, Dudley turns the sherry into top-shelf Shiraz and makes sure that the bottle will never run dry.But like all great Hollywood Christmas movies, THE BISHOP'S WIFE has a simple, direct lesson about motives and motivations and the meaning of life: ""Let us ask ourselves what He would wish for most.

I have always felt that ""The Bishop's Wife"", for all it's charm and whimsy, is only an average story.  What REALLY ELEVATES it into an altogether magical and heartfelt classic is, in my opinion, the incredible musical score by Hugo Friedhofer.  In those scenes in David Niven's sombre study we hear shimmery, otherworldy sounds, the chorales which drift in and out, with the saxophone melody that symbolizes the appearence of the angel in human form...now THAT""S what great filmaking is about!And yet, let's face it: David Niven's problems are really pretty insignificant compared to, say, what Jimmy Stewart faces in ""It's a Wonderful Life"".....here it's all vanity, wounded pride, confrontations with an arrogant old woman, etc....It's tough for me to get too concerned for a cleric who lives with his family in a fabulously lavish house and seem to have all the comforts of the rich and famous, right down to servants and cooks....the plot is really rather tedious in a way.But still, I really enjoy the movie---it has a wonderful mood, especially in the scenes near the old church and in the professor's apartment, as Christmas Eve is growing near and we know the problems must all resolve themselves soon.  I really like the final scene, where the old church is alive again, the boy's choir is singing its new hymn, the atheist professor is attending midnight mass...and everyone seems to be aware on some level that their lives have been touched by something magical...even though they don't CONSCIOUSLY remember Dudley's visit. Pretty cool.I remember reading that Cary Grant really didn't care for the script and bascially walked through his role. I have always felt that way; for all of his charm, there's something cynical and jaded about his performance, if ever so slightly.But there's that lovely skating scene---was that the way it really used to be in the ""Old Days""??  A skating rink with a live band playing--how cool!  Of course, all of the fancy skating is done by doubles, but there's that lovely closeup of Cary Grant and Loretta Young gliding together as James Gleason finally gets the hang of it---what a wonderful moment (again, Mr. Friedhofer's MUSIC really makes the scene work!). But WHY didn't they give us a final close-up of ALL THREE skaters--Dudley, Julia, and Sylvester---gliding together arm in arm----instead of all of those long shots which used professional skaters as doubles? It would have really capped the scene off beautifully. Oh well....BUT NOW I MUST ASK----IS THIS THE BEST DVD TRANSFER THAT MGM COULD GIVE US FOR THIS FILM?????  It's dark and gritty looking---lots of grain in the image...and the volume level is so LOW---I had to crank up my TV volume all the way to really hear it.THE DVD transfer is a MAJOR BAD JOB; it's alarming to think that this release might represent the BEST AVAILABLE source material for this fine film. That would be a great shame.  I hope that something better turns up and that MGM will re-release The Bishop's Wife and give it the treatment that it deserves.",2,I can't believe it's a top-of-the-line DVD!,1012867200,"02 5, 2002",2002,3141,"['Being', 'lover', 'old', 'films', 'am', 'happy', 'read', 'glowing', 'enthusiastic', 'reviews', 'featured', 'Amazon', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'Bishop', 'Wife', 'charm', 'whimsy', 'only', 'average', 'story', 'What', 'REALLY', 'ELEVATES', 'altogether', 'magical', 'heartfelt', 'classic', 'opinion', 'incredible', 'musical', 'score', 'Hugo', 'Friedhofer', 'scenes', 'David', 'Niven', 'sombre', 'study', 'hear', 'shimmery', 'otherworldy', 'sounds', 'chorales', 'drift', 'saxophone', 'melody', 'appearence', 'angel', 'human', 'form', 'now', 'S', 'what', 'great', 'filmaking', 'yet', 'let', 'face', 'David', 'Niven', 'problems', 'are', 'really', 'pretty', 'insignificant', 'compared', 'say', 'what', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'vanity', 'wounded', 'pride', 'confrontations', 'arrogant', 'old', 'woman', 'etc', '.It', 'tough', 'get', 'too', 'concerned', 'cleric', 'who', 'family', 'fabulously', 'lavish', 'house', 'seem', 'have', 'comforts', 'rich', 'famous', 'right', 'down', 'servants', 'cooks', '.the', 'plot', 'really', 'rather', 'tedious', 'way.But', 'still', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', '-it', 'wonderful', 'mood', 'especially', 'scenes', 'old', 'church', 'professor', 'apartment', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'growing', 'know', 'problems', 'must', 'resolve', 'soon', 'really', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'old', 'church', 'alive', 'again', 'boy', 'choir', 'singing', 'new', 'hymn', 'atheist', 'professor', 'attending', 'midnight', 'mass', 'everyone', 'be', 'aware', 'level', 'lives', 'have', 'been', 'touched', 'something', 'magical', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'CONSCIOUSLY', 'remember', 'Dudley', 'visit', 'Pretty', 'cool.I', 'remember', 'reading', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'script', 'bascially', 'walked', 'role', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'way', 'charm', 'something', 'cynical', 'jaded', 'performance', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly.But', 'lovely', 'skating', 'scene', 'way', 'really', 'used', 'be', 'Old', 'Days', 'skating', 'rink', 'live', 'band', 'playing', 'how', 'cool', 'course', 'fancy', 'skating', 'done', 'doubles', 'lovely', 'closeup', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'gliding', 'together', 'James', 'Gleason', 'finally', 'hang', 'wonderful', 'moment', 'again', 'Mr.', 'Friedhofer', 'MUSIC', 'really', 'scene', 'work', 'WHY', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'final', 'close-up', 'ALL', 'THREE', 'skaters', 'Dudley', 'Julia', 'Sylvester', '-gliding', 'together', 'arm', 'arm', 'instead', 'long', 'shots', 'used', 'professional', 'skaters', 'doubles', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'capped', 'scene', 'off', 'beautifully', 'Oh', 'well', '.BUT', 'NOW', 'MUST', 'ASK', 'THIS', 'THE', 'BEST', 'DVD', 'TRANSFER', 'THAT', 'MGM', 'COULD', 'GIVE', 'US', 'FOR', 'THIS', 'FILM', 'dark', 'gritty', 'looking', '-lots', 'grain', 'image', 'volume', 'level', 'so', 'LOW', '-I', 'had', 'crank', 'up', 'TV', 'volume', 'way', 'really', 'hear', 'it.THE', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'MAJOR', 'BAD', 'JOB', 'alarming', 'think', 'release', 'might', 'represent', 'BEST', 'AVAILABLE', 'source', 'material', 'fine', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'shame', 'hope', 'something', 'better', 'up', 'MGM', 'will', 're-release', 'Bishop', 'Wife', 'give', 'treatment']",N/A

I tend to go Postal after repeated exposure to ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and to collapse from sugar shock about halfway through ""Miracle on 34th Street.""  But this movie gets me every time.  Show me just a single scene and I'm hooked.  I drop into a chair and stare in dreamy-eyed, slack-jawed wonder.The cast is a true Hollywood Golden Age ensemble from top stars to supporting players, from Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven to Elsa Lanchester, Gladys Cooper, Monty Woolley and James Gleason: wonderful, wonderful, all of them!  Then there is the magnificent photography--professionalism entwined with art to a degree seldom if ever matched today.  The story is a nice little mid-20th Century parable, not entirely pointless, not too sweet and, thankfully, not too strongly insisted upon.Previous reviewers have pointed out many good things in ""The Bishop's Wife."" Among its many virtues, by no means the least are that Billy Wilder was included among its writers and that Frank Capra had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the film.I feel obliged to draw attention here to two scenes that haven't been strongly emphasized in earlier Amazon reviews:--Mid-way through, Cary Grant as Dudley the Angel and Loretta Young as the Bishop's wife visit the basement of a down-at-the-heels church to hear a children's choir rehearse.  The kids are late.  One arrives and he immediately starts to sing.  The others arrive one by one (with a little help from Dudley), and each begins singing until at last the whole choir is assembled.  That is the best children's choir that I have ever seen or heard (and, yes, I have seen the Vienna Boys Choir.)  The whole sequence lasts only a few minutes but it's a brilliantly facetted gem.--The other scene occurs duriing the extended sequence in which Grant and Young are picked up by cab driver James Gleason.  For good and sufficient reason, the three of them end up skating on an ice rink, to the joy of participants and audience alike.  At one point, the Angel Dudley pronounces a blessing on the cab driver and his descendents.  The scene is at once off-hand and rigidly formal.  The words of the blessing are straightforward but exalted.  In our era in which curses and worse are the common currency of speech, how often do we hear a blessing that is truly moving?",5,My guilty pleasure Christmas movie,1166313600,"12 17, 2006",2006,2447,"['have', 'touch', 'Grinch', 'genetic', 'make-up', 'believe', 'Scrooge', 'listed', 'family', 'tree', 'six', 'generations', 'back', 'tend', 'go', 'Postal', 'repeated', 'exposure', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'collapse', 'sugar', 'shock', 'halfway', 'Miracle', '34th', 'Street', 'movie', 'time', 'Show', 'just', 'single', 'scene', ""'m"", 'hooked', 'drop', 'chair', 'stare', 'dreamy-eyed', 'slack-jawed', 'wonder.The', 'cast', 'true', 'Hollywood', 'Golden', 'Age', 'ensemble', 'top', 'stars', 'supporting', 'players', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'David', 'Niven', 'Elsa', 'Lanchester', 'Gladys', 'Cooper', 'Monty', 'Woolley', 'James', 'Gleason', 'wonderful', 'wonderful', 'Then', 'magnificent', 'photography', 'professionalism', 'entwined', 'art', 'degree', 'seldom', 'ever', 'matched', 'today', 'story', 'nice', 'little', 'mid-20th', 'Century', 'parable', 'not', 'entirely', 'pointless', 'not', 'too', 'sweet', 'thankfully', 'not', 'too', 'strongly', 'insisted', 'upon.Previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'Bishop', 'Wife', 'many', 'virtues', 'least', 'are', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'was', 'included', 'writers', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'had', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'do', 'film.I', 'feel', 'obliged', 'draw', 'attention', 'here', 'two', 'scenes', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'strongly', 'emphasized', 'earlier', 'Amazon', 'Mid-way', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Dudley', 'Angel', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'Bishop', 'wife', 'visit', 'basement', 'down-at-the-heels', 'church', 'hear', 'children', 'choir', 'rehearse', 'kids', 'are', 'late', 'One', 'immediately', 'sing', 'others', 'arrive', 'one', 'one', 'little', 'help', 'Dudley', 'singing', 'last', 'whole', 'choir', 'assembled', 'best', 'children', 'choir', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'heard', 'yes', 'have', 'seen', 'Vienna', 'Boys', 'Choir', 'whole', 'sequence', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'brilliantly', 'facetted', 'gem.', 'other', 'scene', 'duriing', 'extended', 'sequence', 'Grant', 'Young', 'are', 'picked', 'up', 'cab', 'driver', 'James', 'Gleason', 'good', 'sufficient', 'reason', 'three', 'end', 'up', 'skating', 'ice', 'rink', 'joy', 'participants', 'audience', 'alike', 'one', 'point', 'Angel', 'Dudley', 'blessing', 'cab', 'driver', 'descendents', 'scene', 'once', 'off-hand', 'rigidly', 'formal', 'words', 'blessing', 'are', 'straightforward', 'exalted', 'era', 'curses', 'worse', 'are', 'common', 'currency', 'speech', 'how', 'often', 'do', 'hear', 'blessing', 'truly', 'moving']",N/A

VERY family friendly.AWARDS - 1 Academy Award for BEST SOUND & 4 nominations including BEST PICTURE.THEMES - Faith, hope, love, spirituality.STORY - This could be subtitled 'be careful what you pray for'. David Niven is the Bishop and he's under a lot of pressure to raise money for a new Cathedral. There is one wealthy donor that can make it happen but it means compromising to satisfy her. This pressure has also put a strain on what has until now been a wonderful marriage. It's also Christmas and his family wants to spend time with him which he doesn't believe he can spare. In desperation he cries out to God for wisdom. He thought he was asking for help in building the cathedral. He received something entirely different. Cary Grant shows up as Dudley the Angel and sets about trying to help the Bishop. He also tries to mend the relationship between Julia (Loretta Young) and the Bishop and finds himself becoming attracted to her. The Bishop also senses this. It eventually comes to a head and leads to a much different conclusion than the Bishop expected. This is a delightful, romantic comedy and should be a Christmas favorite right along with It's A Wonderful Life and other Christmas classics.

302676,A2BGTNW1J3VBHL,6302227127,"L. P. Schneider ""booklistener""","[2, 3]","This is one of my very favorite Christmas classics.  Though I hadn't heard of and didn't see the film until 1980, it immediately joined the ranks of my holiday favorites - at the top of the list.  Here's why:1.  Cary Grant as an angel. This is perfect casting and the elegant Mr. Grant plays Dudley with effortless aplomb and grace.  The role was made for him and without him the film would probably not be the classic it is (who else could've played an angel and not seemed ridiculous?).  Watching each woman in the film fall under his charismatic and kindly spell is special fun.2.  A wonderful supporting cast: Loretta Young, David Niven, James Gleason, Gladys Cooper, Elsa Lanchester, Monty Woolley, Sara Haden, Regis Toomey.  This is a splendid ensemble cast and every member delivers.  I especially enjoy the great Glady's Cooper's arrogant and demanding aristocrat, Mrs. Hamilton, who becomes putty in Dudley's presence, and the always excellent James Gleason as the cabby, Sylvester.  But Niven, Lanchester, Woolley and Haden are all standouts.  Loretta Young's soft and astonishing beauty assist her well in the title role as the rather sheltered and innocent but increasingly unhappy wife of a bishop (Niven) who is in the process of losing his way.3. A good old fashioned Christmas message.  The moral of the story is that Christmas is about peace on earth and goodwill toward others, not  material objects (gifts, cathedrals, etc.) or personal glory. The plot delivers this message gently and well.4.  It's a Sam Goldwyn film, so it's first rate.  Aside from the long, deep list of stars and solid supporting actors, the production is sleek and goodlooking, the plot is engaging, the script facile and often clever and amusing.Since I first saw ""The Bishop's Wife,"" I've become aware of other classic holiday films (THANKS TO TURNER CLASSIC MOVIES) that were unknown to me before: ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" (Judy Garland) and ""Christmas in Connecticut"" (Barbara Stanwyck) in particular.  In fact these three are my favorites.  Add the 1984 TV version of ""A Christmas Carol"" starring George C. Scott and the 1970 musical, ""Scrooge,"" with Albert Finney and you have five peerless Christmas classics.",5,Near-Perfect,1229731200,"12 20, 2008",2008,2206,"['one', 'very', 'favorite', 'Christmas', 'classics', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', '1980', 'immediately', 'joined', 'ranks', 'holiday', 'top', 'list', 'Here', 'why:1', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'angel', 'perfect', 'casting', 'elegant', 'Mr.', 'Grant', 'Dudley', 'effortless', 'aplomb', 'grace', 'role', 'was', 'made', 'film', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'classic', 'who', 'else', 'could', ""'ve"", 'played', 'angel', 'not', 'seemed', 'ridiculous', 'Watching', 'woman', 'film', 'fall', 'charismatic', 'kindly', 'spell', 'special', 'fun.2', 'wonderful', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'David', 'Niven', 'James', 'Gleason', 'Gladys', 'Cooper', 'Elsa', 'Lanchester', 'Monty', 'Woolley', 'Sara', 'Haden', 'Regis', 'Toomey', 'splendid', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'member', 'delivers', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'great', 'Glady', 'Cooper', 'arrogant', 'demanding', 'aristocrat', 'Mrs.', 'Hamilton', 'who', 'putty', 'Dudley', 'presence', 'always', 'excellent', 'James', 'Gleason', 'cabby', 'Sylvester', 'Niven', 'Lanchester', 'Woolley', 'Haden', 'are', 'standouts', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'soft', 'astonishing', 'beauty', 'assist', 'well', 'title', 'role', 'rather', 'sheltered', 'innocent', 'increasingly', 'unhappy', 'wife', 'bishop', 'Niven', 'who', 'process', 'losing', 'way.3', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'Christmas', 'message', 'moral', 'story', 'Christmas', 'about', 'peace', 'earth', 'goodwill', 'others', 'not', 'material', 'objects', 'gifts', 'cathedrals', 'etc', 'personal', 'glory', 'plot', 'delivers', 'message', 'gently', 'well.4', 'Sam', 'Goldwyn', 'film', 'first', 'rate', 'long', 'deep', 'list', 'stars', 'solid', 'supporting', 'actors', 'production', 'sleek', 'goodlooking', 'plot', 'engaging', 'script', 'facile', 'often', 'clever', 'amusing.Since', 'first', 'saw', 'Bishop', 'Wife', ""'ve"", 'become', 'aware', 'other', 'classic', 'holiday', 'films', 'THANKS', 'TO', 'TURNER', 'CLASSIC', 'MOVIES', 'were', 'unknown', 'Meet', 'Me', 'St.', 'Louis', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Christmas', 'Connecticut', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'particular', 'fact', 'three', 'are', 'favorites', 'Add', '1984', 'TV', 'version', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'starring', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', '1970', 'musical', 'Scrooge', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'have', 'five', 'peerless', 'Christmas', 'classics']",N/A

The plot turns around a stressed out, overwrought, harried pastor (David Niven), constantly obsessed about raising funds for a new cathedral. He plays the pinch nosed role to the hilt and turns in the film's best performance. Thickening the plot is his patient, beautiful, too good to be true, supportive wife (Loretta Young), who he usually ignores. An angel ! (Cary Grant) appears to help him out of his misery. Grant is slightly too smooth for words but as good angels will, engineers a happy ending. Young's tolerant, loving attitude toward the brooding Niven is another high point of BW. I was unaware of how attractive she was. The supporting cast, including Gladys Cooper, Elsa Lanchester and Monty Woolley are excellent. The gloomy black and white, wintertime eponymous setting is perfect. This is one movie that should not be colorized! Some have suggested that Young's work in BW was a factor is her winning Best Actress Oscar for ""The Farmer's Daughter"" later in 1947. I have read elsewhere that it was Grant who suggested role reversals between he and Niven. The producers certainly were correct to agree! Niven was made to be that unhappy parson! The only weak point is that ""famous"" skating scene. What were they thinking? Since when do male angels take some guy's wife skating? That belonged on a cutting room floor!

This is a Samuel Goldwyn film that is as enchanting and fulfilling as anything to ever come from Hollywood.

Dudley (Grant) is an angel, the answer to the bishop's prayer that turns out to be his greatest obstacle when he takes a sudden interest in Julia (Young).Previously released by HBO Home Video, this MGM edition appears to be the same disappointing transfer as before.

Dudley follows Julia to a Christmas tree lot, where she meets her old friend, Professor Wutheridge, and expresses her sadness that her husband Henry is too busy worrying about fund raising for a new cathedral to enjoy the season with his parishioners. The professor offers Julia a contribution of an ancient Roman coin from his collection. After Julia leaves for home, Dudley purposely bumps into the professor and makes inquiries about the Broughams. When Julia arrives home, she finds Henry in a tense meeting with several important parishioners, including Mrs. Agnes Hamilton, a wealthy widow, who insists that her large contribution toward the cathedral's construction guarantee a proper memorial to her dead husband. Henry is upset by Julia's tardiness and the meeting breaks up after Mrs. Hamilton threatens to withdraw her support unless satisfied. Julia mentions seeing the professor and gives Henry the ancient coin, which he angrily dismisses as worthless. Trying to make amends for his curtness, Henry asks Julia to have lunch with him the following day as they used to do, and she delightedly agrees. After retiring to his study, however, Henry is beset by messages and demands on his time. Dismissing his assistant, Mildred Cassaway, Henry prays for guidance, and a few moments later, Dudley mysteriously arrives and informs Henry that he is an angel sent in answer to his prayer. Henry is immediately skeptical, and when Julia comes in a few moments later, Dudley introduces himself as Henry's assistant, which pleases her and upsets Henry. The next morning Henry is dismayed to see that Dudley has returned and ingratiated himself with Mildred Cassaway, the maid, Matilda, and even the family dog, Queenie. Julia is disappointed that Henry has broken their luncheon date and sadly takes their young daughter Debby to the park. After Henry departs, Dudley follows Julia and Debby to the park and helps the little girl build her confidence during a snowball fight. Dudley offers to take Julia to lunch just as Matilda inexplicably shows up to relieve her of Debby. Dudley takes Julia to Michel's, which she reveals is her favorite restaurant and is where Henry proposed to her. When they are spotted by several parish ladies, Dudley wards off gossip by inviting them to join him and Julia. Walking home later, Julia and Dudley run into the professor, who is suspicious of Dudley, yet invites them to his tiny apartment, where he admits that due to a lack of inspiration he has not worked for some time on his manuscript about ancient Rome. Dudley, who has retrieved the ancient coin from the Brougahms', returns it to the professor and piques his interest by informing him of the rare and valuable coin's unique history. Meanwhile, Henry has rescheduled his appointments so that he can make his lunch date with Julia and is annoyed to discover that she has gone out with Dudley. The next day, Dudley tells Debby the story of David, who is helped by an angel, which only vexes Henry further. Later, Henry accepts an appointment to meet with Mrs. Hamilton, knowing it will conflict with his promised appearance at choir practice at his old parish. Despite Julia's pleas, Henry insists on seeing Mrs. Hamilton, and Dudley accompanies Julia to the rehearsal. At Mrs. Hamilton's, Henry agrees to all her demands in exchange for her complete support of the cathedral but, while hastening to leave to meet Julia, finds himself stuck to a recently varnished chair. At the church, meanwhile, Rev. Miller is embarrassed by the poor turnout, but Dudley reassures him and asks the couple of boys present to begin singing. Gradually all the boys arrive and give an inspiring performance under Dudley's direction. As the still-stuck Henry fumes at Mrs. Hamilton's, Dudley and Julia catch a cab into town where Dudley purchases a hat for Julia he knows she admires. Then Dudley asks the cab driver, Sylvester, to stop at a park where a crowd is ice skating and, with Dudley's guidance, both Julia and Sylvester skate enthusiastically. Dudley and Julia return home, where Henry angrily demands that Dudley leave for good. Henry's outburst depresses Julia, and the next day, Christmas Eve, the household wonders if Dudley will ever return. After Henry and Julia leave to make calls, Dudley arrives and rewrites Henry's Christmas sermon, dictating while the typewriter takes down the new speech. Dudley then transforms the Christmas tree over which Matilda has been laboring and departs to see Mrs. Hamilton. While waiting in the wealthy woman's drawing room, Dudley discovers a hidden piece of sheet music inscribed to Mrs. Hamilton from a man who is not her husband. Dudley plays the tune on Mrs. Hamilton's harp, and she confesses that in her youth she was in love with the tune's composer, but feared poverty and rejected him. In an effort to make up for not loving her wealthy husband, she has steadfastly tried to maintain his legacy. Later, when Henry and Julia arrive, Mrs. Hamilton thanks Henry for sending Dudley to her and tells them that he has inspired her to give her money to the needy rather than build the cathedral. Utterly dismayed, Henry tells Julia he will meet her at home and, wandering into town, stops by the professor's, where he confides that Dudley is an angel who has upset everything. He apologizes for rejecting the professor's coin, which the old scholar returns to him, declaring that it has inspired him and may help Henry too. When Henry sadly reveals he believes he has lost Julia to Dudley, the professor reminds him that he is human and Dudley is not and encourages him to fight for Julia. At the Broughams' home, while Dudley and Julia stand admiring the Christmas tree, Dudley tells her it is time for him to leave, but asks her to have him stay. Disturbed by his implication, Julia tells him that he must go and hastens upstairs just as Henry arrives to challenge Dudley. Dudley is pleased that Henry has finally acknowledged that Julia is the most important thing in his life and reminds the bishop that he never prayed for a cathedral, but for guidance. He wistfully adds that it is bad when an angel envies a mortal and informs Henry that after he goes, no one will have any memory of his existence. Henry then finds himself alone in his study praying before the painting of the cathedral, and abruptly races upstairs looking for Julia, who is putting Debby to bed. They embrace and then depart for St. Timothy's where Henry delivers Dudley's Christmas sermon. Dudley listens from the street, and satisfied, departs.The Bishop's Wife (1947) is a Samuel Goldwyn romantic comedy feature film starring Cary Grant, Loretta Young, and David Niven in a story about an angel who helps a bishop with his problems. It was released by RKO. The film was adapted by Leonardo Bercovici and Robert E. Sherwood from the novel of the same name by Robert Nathan, and was directed by Henry Koster.The film won the Academy Award for Sound, and was nominated for Best Director, Best Film Editing, Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture and Best Picture.It was remade in 1996 as The Preacher's Wife starring Denzel Washington, Whitney Houston, and Courtney B. VancProduction was not without troubles. Producer Samuel Goldwyn replaced director William A. Seiter with Henry Koster to create a completely new film. Niven was originally cast as the angel and Dana Andrews as the bishop, but Koster brought in Cary Grant to play the angel and gave the role of the bishop to Niven. In early previews, audiences disliked the film, so Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett made uncredited rewrites.Although no denomination is mentioned in the film, the characters are clearly members of the Episcopal Church.",5,A CHRISTMAS TREASURE FOR ALL TIME!,1229644800,"12 19, 2008",2008,7915,"['Christmas', 'season', 'Dudley', 'angel', 'guise', 'mortal', 'small', 'town', 'notices', 'Julia',

Anyone who has had ministry experience will empathize with David Niven's character as the pastor of a church that is in somewhat of a decline.  After years of struggling to grow his church, he is desparate to ""save"" his church and his ministry by securing the funding of a new building program.  He is so focused on this goal that he is willing to sacrifice his ideals and his marriage in order to achieve it.  What's very realistic about this is that Niven's character thinks he is doing ""God's work"" in his pursuit.  Unless one has been in full-time ministry, it is difficult to grasp the pressure ministers are under to ""produce"" growth - to have a ""successful"" ministry.  This pressure is captured very well in the film.  In the process of achieving this funding for a new church building, Niven's character has lost sight of Who and what he is serving, and worse, he is totally unaware of his cold and ""stagnant"" relationships with God, his wife, his co-workers, and those he is called to love and serve.In steps an angel, Cary Grant, who is sent to influence this driven, over-worked, frantic, and misguided pastor/husband to recover his once-sincere devotion to his God, to his ministry, and to his wife.  Complications arise when Grant's character and the pastor's (Niven) wife, Loretta Young, are attracted to each other.  The angel falls in love with the pastor's neglected and dispirited wife.Of course everything works out in the end.  The angel (Grant) accomplishes his mission and the pastor is restored to genuine love of God and his wife.  There are many sweet and endearing characters and scenes along the way.

302708,A1P72UWV85UTX8,6302227127,OK Kat,"[1, 1]",This is a sweet movie that on the surface teaches a morality lesson about letting the end justify the means.  It skillfully walks the line between overt Christianity and complete disconnection with a specific faith.  I am a Christian and was not offended by the disconnection and I think that most non-Christians would not be offended by the Christian setting.  I was provoked to ponder the question of whether money is better spent on infrastructure or needy people and how to know if you are truly doing God's will or if you've got it all wrong.  And about the difference between giving out of guilt or from a sincere desire to be God's instrument.  These are of course secondary in the movie which focuses mainly on the loss of the close relationship between the Bishop and his wife and his former parishioners and friends.  It also touches on the source of inspiration and the &#34;it's never too late&#34; theme and the idea that when people act badly there is an underlying hurt.  I think it's a simple story that can be enjoyed as such and it hints at deeper things that causes one to think (maybe after you've watched it twice like I did).,4,Get out the Kleenex,1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,1147,"['sweet', 'movie', 'surface', 'morality', 'lesson', 'letting', 'end', 'means', 'skillfully', 'line', 'overt', 'Christianity', 'complete', 'disconnection', 'specific', 'faith', 'am', 'Christian', 'was', 'not', 'offended', 'disconnection', 'think', 'most', 'non-Christians', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'offended', 'Christian', 'setting', 'was', 'provoked', 'ponder', 'question', 'money', 'better', 'spent', 'infrastructure', 'needy', 'people', 'how', 'know', 'are', 'truly', 'doing', 'God', 'will', ""'ve"", 'got', 'wrong', 'difference', 'giving', 'guilt', 'sincere', 'desire', 'be', 'God', 'instrument', 'are', 'course', 'secondary', 'movie', 'mainly', 'loss', 'close', 'relationship', 'Bishop', 'wife', 'former', 'parishioners', 'friends', 'also', 'source', 'inspiration', '34', 'never', 'too', 'late', '34', 'theme', 'idea', 'when', 'people', 'act', 'badly', 'underlying', 'hurt', 'think', 'simple', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'such', 'deeper', 'things', 'one', 'think', 'maybe', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'twice', 'did']",N/A

302710,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6302227127,Only-A-Child,"[8, 8]","At last here is an angel who really has fun just doing his job.  Dudley (Cary Grant) brings a subtle joy to his interventions and interactions.  The enjoyment factor is what makes ""The Bishop's Wife"" special.  This charming and seemingly simple film has been a Christmas holiday staple since its release in 1947.But like ""Groundhog Day"", the surface simplicity is misleading, as this is an allegorical tale about the importance of getting outside ourselves and taking steps to escape  ruts of our day-to-day lives; i.e. finding a better way of living.  Dudley works a few minor heavenly miracles but his real power is as a cheerleader and personal guide.  No need to be an angel to exercise this kind of positive influence on others.Dudley the angel  comes to earth to help a Bishop (David Niven) juggle his professional and marital commitments, the conflict being that his priorities have changed since his promotion from the priest of a struggling parish.  Only the bishop knows that Dudley is other than human and it takes most of the film before he is totally convinced.  Meanwhile his wife and many others in the town are swept up by Dudley's  charms. The Bishop is pre-occupied with securing funding for constructing a new cathedral but begins to catch on that Dudley and his wife are getting along so well that the unimaginable could occur-the angel stealing his wife.If only one word could be used to describe ""The Bishop's Wife"" it would be subtle.  The special effects are minimalist but effective, the careful framing and lighting of Gregg Toland's  (""Citizen Kane"") black and white cinematography, the tentative steps title character Julia (Loretta Young) takes as she starts to experience happiness again, and the slow realization by Bishop Henry of how far he has drifted from what matters the most.The unity and subtlety is best illustrated in the scene of Henry walking up the sidewalk towards the Professor's (Monty Wooley) apartment.  Although a few minutes from the end, this is actually the film's climax as Henry is finally confronting himself.  As he walks forward the dark screen begins to get brighter; in step with his progress toward spiritual change and discovery is the end of his physical journey.  He moves symbolically (and literally) toward the light.Rounding out the strong cast are James Gleason (Max Corkle in ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"") Elsa Lanchester,  and Gladys Cooper.  Henry and Julia's young daughter is played by Karolyn Grimes (Zuzu in ""It's a Wonderful Life"").A nice thing is that while the film's ""little"" miracles are done onscreen they are interwoven into the fabric of the story instead of dominating a scene.  This casualness fits the tone of the film as does the occasional satirical line.  The most memorable conversation is Cooper's demand (she is pledging money for the new cathedral) that the George figure in the proposed ""St. George and the Dragon"" stained glass window  be made to resemble her late husband.  Then Niven (deadpan) asks her whom she wants the dragon to resemble.There will be a few who do not enjoy this film but I recommend it to anyone who wants a nice holiday film, or who is interested in a relatively deep allegorical tale of one's capacity to be a positive influence on others, or who just wants to see a truly awesome example of technical filmmaking.Then again, what do I know?

As far as I know it is the only black and white movie still shown on network television.  But there other superb ""holiday"" movies.  One that you may not be familiar with is Samuel Goldwyn's 1947 production of  ""The  Bishop's Wife"" starring Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven.Cary Grant plays an angel named Dudley in this film (Dudley?) who all of a sudden appears  in response to the prayers of a newly installed bishop (David Niven) who is at his wit's end trying to raise funds for a new cathedral.  Being chairperson of my church's Capital Campaign I can totally relate to what the bishop was going through.  Anyway,  his fund-raising campaign is not going so well and is consuming practically all of his time.  He is desperate with worry and his responsibilities as bishop are beginning to take their toll on his relationship with his wife Julia(Loretta Young) and his young daughter.  With the Christmas holidays approaching Dudley appears to help the bishop sort it all out.  What neither Dudley nor the bishop could have ever anticipated was that Dudley would suddenly become smitten with the lovely and vivacious Julia. This simply had never happened to him before!  Needless to day the budding relationship between angel and wife wreaks all sorts of havoc.  But as was so often the case in these old classic flicks everything turns out OK in the end.""The Bishop's Wife""  is yet another movie from this period that my wife and I can enjoy again and again.

This movie is set in Yuletide spirit with bells ringing, choir singing, Christmas wreaths decorating the walls of churches, homes, shops and buildings, and streets and neighborhoods covered with fresh snow. During this time, an angel named Dudley (Cary Grant) enters the lives of the bishop and his wife as an office assistant. At the Victorian home of Bishop Henry not everything is going well. Years of neglect about his own family left Julia on her own while the bishop is busy raising funds for a new cathedral. Dudley's attentiveness, charm, and sheer magical powers drive Julia to him, but Dudley is only interested in helping Henry to get back with Julia. The writers have cleverly crafted many moments between Dudley and Julia that would be purely romantic, but writers did not forget to remind us that Dudley is an angel and he is not romancing Julia. Several instances of walking down the street, driving in the country and having lunch at local cafeteria makes her feel that she is appreciated as a woman. The magical ice-skating scene where Dudley charms everyone with his skating ability, and helps Julia to glide on ice is a memorable scene of the movie.Dudley's ""angelic"" effect is felt by many: He touches the lives of people he comes in contact with. As the friendship between Julia and Dudley becomes strong, Henry begins to feel that Dudley is a devil trying to steal his wife, but soon all ends well when Dudley completes his job by helping Henry to raise money for the cathedral. Cary Grant is spectacular and charms not only Julia but many viewers.

Unfortunately, I had to watch The Bishop's Wife when it was shown on the TCM channel, however, I was thrilled when I was able to purchase it.  Cary Grant is an angel who arrives to help a Bishop (David Niven)realize that his ministry is not about grand schemes or huge cathedrals, but his ministry is about the simple things in life.  Loretta Young is the Bishop's wife and Cary Grant befriends her and through his friendship, she comes to realize that her husband needs to return to his simple way of ministry.  I am a lover of old movies and this one does not disappoint.  It is a really sweet, funny, and dramatic look at people and their faults and their goodness.  The acting is fabulous and seems so uncontrived.  Each of the stars are so perfect for their parts that it is hard to imagine that, at one time, David Niven wanted to play the part of the angel.  I think another reason why this movie is so wonderful is that it harkens back to a different time...when life was less stressful, less complicated.

It's trying times for Bishop Henry Brougham (Niven), who's trying to raise enough funds for the construction of a cathedral for his church; he has a patron, the widow Mrs. Hamilton (Gladys Cooper), who will donate handsomely, but only if she is allowed to ""call the shots"" as it were.  Henry has become increasingly distracted by it all, as well as distant, a fact which hasn't gone unnoticed by his wife, Julia (Young).  When Henry prays for help, his prayers are answered in the form of an angel named Dudley (Grant), who announces himself to Henry and quickly manages to ingratiate himself with Julia.  And with Dudley's help, Henry ultimately discovers what is truly important in his life.  Koster has crafted a pleasing and thoroughly entertaining movie that examines the good and bright side of human nature, and how refreshing it is in an era when so many films explore the dark side exclusively.  It's an elegant film with performances to match, with the charismatic Grant giving a relaxed and polished turn as the angel.  He fairly oozes charm, seemingly effortlessly, with a presence that is captivating to the other characters as well as to the audience; and he brings a sense of peace and serenity to the proceedings that gives total credibility to Dudley.  Grant makes it easy to believe that he's the angel he claims to be.  Young, as well, is simply outstanding as Julia, lending a dignity to the role while managing to remain down-to-earth and totally accessible.  There's an endearing warmth about her that makes her someone with whom you would like to spend more time; a gracious woman of classic beauty, both inside and out.  And Niven, as Henry, strikes a countenance that defines class, and he exacts the  sympathy of the viewer by making his character one with whom you can readily identify; his consternation becomes yours, and you breathe a little easier once you know Dudley is on the job.  The supporting cast includes Monty Woolley (Professor Wutheridge), James Gleason (Sylvester), the terrific Elsa Lanchester (Matilda), Sara Haden (Mildred), Regis Toomey (Mr. Miller) and young Karolyn Grimes (Debby).  Watching this film, it's easy to understand why it's been designated as ""classic.""  Well written and stylishly delivered, ""The Bishop's Wife"" is an absorbing, memorable film that makes you realize (either again or, perhaps for many, the first time) why Grant, Young and Niven are considered ""stars,"" and how much great character actors like Woolley, Gleason and Lanchester contributed to so many great films during their careers.

It is a prime example of &#34;Be Careful What You Wish For&#34;, or you might get it.  The Role Reversal was a grand idea of Grant's, as I could never see Grant as a Bishop &#8212; nor Niven as an Angel!  The entire cast of this movie is so well chosen, that it has to be one of the best things ever to come ot of Hollywood at any time.  In Blu-Ray it is a marvelous 'Movie-in-its-Own-Time' in glorious black and white.  Colorizing this would do more harm than good, as we need to be transported back in time to get the correct feeling of that period.  The 1940's were a time of great turmoil abroad that effected many of us here in America.  But the urge to include that trauma was avoided, and just as well.  We needed to focus on our lives at home and on the things that truly mattered to all of us.  It was a time when you never said &#34;Happy Holidays.&#34;  It was Christmas, and Christ was still in the forefront of our celebration.  It was unthinkable to have a business open late on Christmas Eve, much less even open on at all on Christmas Day!  Yes, it is primarily a Christian Holiday, and as a religious group we have every right as much as the next religion to celebrate it openly.  Then we were not ashamed to show our beliefs, and they didn't seem to be an affront to others as they are today.  It speaks volumes to see the simply glories of belief and charity and family.  This story manages to combine all the ingredients of script and acting and sets and characters in a very realistic (for the times) view.  There is nothing in this story to be ashamed of, nor afraid of.  It is a fine show for every member of the family, and hopefully helps to renew meaning in the story and glory of Christmas.  Five Stars do not do this film justice, but it is all I can give it.  It still moves me 50-odd years later.

Not withstanding the fact that it was nominated Best Picture in 1947, I felt the story went a bit slow, the whole ""tempted angel"" thing didn't fly, and David Niven was relegated to a jealous husband ""comedy.""David Niven plays the bishop of this parish -- not fully explained.  I would have liked to have seen more back-story.  Some of that is furnished through Loretta Young's character, who plays the wife, who pines for the good old days when her husband was more concerned with the parishioners and less concerned with kowtowing the local wealthy biddies for money to build his cathedral.The only way he will get a cathedral is by making it in honor of his wealthy patron, Mrs. Hamilton, who keeps rubbing it in that he became bishop in the first place because of her.Cary Grant appears on the scene and though he does a few interesting tricks, it's not super outlandish (as in a Mr. Topper ghost-type movie --Topper Returns) but does talk to a typewriter which dutifully records a Christmas sermon.The skating sequence is a bit much, and you can tell the stunt doubles were probably Olympic skaters -- can't imagine Loretta Young doing a few spins around the lake and Dudley jumping about -- with a taxi cabbie for company!The story does  not center a lot on the bishop as Cary the Angel (Dudley of all names) starts making time with his wife.  They go skating together, he charms her in a taxi, he gets boys to sing Christmas songs and little girls to swoon at the story of David and the Lion.The bishop getting jealous and hateful, of not taking the high ground and groveling the rich widow was a bit much.  The Angel was making time with his wife and she had no clue?  Even in 1947 I think that was a bit of a stretch.[SPOILER] The ending was unusual: The Angel does not get the girl, the bishop does not get a cathedral, but he does realize that his family is more important than money.

302759,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6302227127,Simon Davis,"[5, 5]","It always mystifies me why this truly touching 1948 Christmas movie is not better known. It certainly hasn't got the high seasonal profile of efforts such as ""It's a Wonderful Life"", and ""Miracle on 34th Street"", however it deserves to be given its great characters, moving story and still relevant examination of people's misplaced values and lack of focus on those things in life that are really important. The legendary trio of actors performing here; Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven are perfectly cast in their respective roles and bring great conviction and meaning to their dialogue and the situations they perform. Of course being a story taking place at Christmas and dealing with individuals learning the real values in life the movie seems to radiate a tremendous feeling of goodwill and especially hope with each screening and for that reason alone it is a much treasured part of my Christmas viewing each December.The story opens where we find Bishop Henry Broughman (David Niven), in a quandery about finding the necessary funds to build his new Parish Cathedral. He is constrained by the demands of wealthy widow Mrs. Hamilton (Gladys Cooper), who wants the Cathedral to be a memorial to her late husband. Under his Parish demands Henry neglects his wife Julia (Loretta Young), and his young daughter Debby (Karolyn Grimes)constantly breaking promises to spend more time with them. With things in their marriage going from bad to worse suddenly, as if from heaven (!) help arrives in the form of a mysterious man called simply ""Dudley"", (Cary Grant). Offering to work as Henry's assistant in the Parish Office, Dudley has a strange ""other worldly"", demeanour about him and he never seems to get ruffled or flustered. He also seems to have solutions to most of Henry's problems much to the Bishop's annoyance. Dudley begins to make Julia feel wanted again and the two begin to rediscover life and go ice skating , shopping and dining out in the Bishop and Julia's favourite restaurant. Dudley seems to have a way with most people and manages to also remotivate the Brougham's old friend Professor Wutheridge  to begin writing again after many years. Dominated by the demands of Mrs. Hamilton and having to compromise everything to suit her, Henry finds that Dudley even seems to have the magic touch with this formidable woman when he meets her and the plans for this monument to her husband who she actually didn't even love are scraped. Sensing Julia's  attachment to him and finding his own feelings growing Dudley senses that his work is done in the Bishop's household as both parties seem to have rediscovered what is important in their lives. The conclusion sees Henry back at his earlier Parish of St. Timothy's delivering a sermon which in actual fact was left for him by the now departed Dudley. Once gone all memory of Dudley in the lives of Henry and Julia is erased allowing them to get on with their lives together undistracted, the only exception being the ""guardian angel"", which mysteriously appears above their daughter's bed.Quite rightly nominated for Academy Awards as Best Picture and  Best Director for Henry Koster the film really could have been nominated in a number of other areas as well, especially the acting. It's hard now to imagine considering the way the two male leads are so perfectly cast that when ""The Bishop's Wife"", first went into production Cary Grant and David Niven where playing the others role. Two weeks into production they realised the mistake that had been made and the roles were reversed. Cary Grant makes a perfect angel and he was right to swap roles with David Niven who is also ideally suited to play the distracted Bishop sorely in need of ""divine intervention"". Grant with his good looks, suave charm, and expert delivery of lines that of course we the audience know have a double meaning really makes you almost believe he is an angel and a great deal of the wonderment in this story is due to his great work. Loretta Young also excels in her role as the neglected wife who sees her husband and their life together slowly fading away under the plans to build the new Cathedral. Her chemistry with Cary Grant is terrific and the warm affection turning to a subtle kind of love as the story progresses contains some great acting. David Niven probably has the least appealing but also in some ways the most difficult of the three main character roles. His plight about building a huge edifice to a dead man's memory at first seems rather shallow however once again through his skillful playing Niven manages to make us see the difficulties that he is experiencing and how it is effecting him as an individual which necessarily softens his character. His work with Cary Grant in particular also shines and the two share many amusing moments over the Bishop's disbelief that Dudley is in actual fact an angel sent down to earth to help him. Monty Wooley in the smaller role of Professor Wutheridge had one of his more appealing characters here and he is wonderful as the bemused old academic who courtesy of Dudley's ""intervention"", has his belief in himself restored so that he can finish his novel on Ancient Rome after many years. ""The Bishop's Wife"", I feel should have received a Cinematograhy Oscar nomination as there has rarely been a more beautiful looking film set at Christmas. The scenes of Dudley and Julia ice skating, the Carol Singers in the snow covered streets and the excellent special effects especially when Dudley magically decorates the family Christmas tree with the raising of his hands all add up to a beautiful looking and magical viewing experience to cherish. The inclusion of the real life Mitchell Boys Choir into the story as the singers at St. Timothy's also adds a special highly appropriate element to this Christmas offering and their famous voices are featured prominently in one excellent Carol scene.If ever you even just a little believed in magic or that there is someone ""on the other side"", looking out for you in this life then you can't help but love ""The Bishop's Wife"". I also happen to like the remake titled ""The Preacher's Wife"", that starred Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston very much as well but it was a very different type of movie. This earlier film from 1948 makes perfect Christmas viewing with a human message that is  just as relevant at any other time in the year, which is to not  take what you have for granted ever and always hold on to those things or people who are important to you. Enjoy Cary Grant as the perfect angel in the Yuletide offering ""The Bishop's Wife"", soon.",5,Truly A Heaven Sent Christmas Gem,1102982400,"12 14, 2004",2004,6620,"['always', 'why', 'truly',

Not because of its scope (i.e. Ben Hur) but because of its heart!The original is Black and White (which I prefer) and although a bit grainy, has a softness that is warm and inviting, and matches the softness of the characters. It has a great script, great dialog and is wonderfully directed.I won't go into the plot, it's too much fun to experience as it unfolds. But I will mention the cast:Cary Grant - He fits the role of Dudley perfectly. I cannot imagine anyone more graceful, gracious, elegant or caring and loving. He is THE ultimate angel!David Niven - Another perfect fit -- for the role of the Bishop. He gives a fantastic performance as the struggling man of the cloth who has gone slightly off direction and needs divine help to get back on track.Loretta Young - Almost too good to be true, she is the perfect ""wife"" of the 1940's bishop. Supportive, kind, loving, but so worried about her marriage difficulties and the distancing of her husband (Niven) that she can't seem to fix herself. Beautiful and innocent performance.Monty Wooley - As the professor, he is a sort of Everyman -- those of us who have been knocked about in life by experience and are in need of inspiration. He gets it -- and then some -- from Dudley (Grant) in the most delightful way. Charming performance.Gladys Cooper - As an elderly dowager, richer than an entire town, she gives a great performance. Her character is somewhat reminiscent of the old biddy in ""Now Voyager"" but not as sharp or cruel. But she is still a force to be reckoned with -- headstrong, proud and arrogant... until Dudley (Grant) unfreezes her heart and releases the gentleness within.There are many more stellar performances in the film especially from Angela Lansbury and James Gleason.While this film has a definite religious overtone, it is respectful and does not get preachy. It is a kind and gentle movie that says more about unconditional love and the hope that all can go right in the world, if only we would relax a bit and see the true value of each other and our relationships.This is a charming classic movie, I wish there were films like this being made today!Highly recommended.",5,A Brilliant Movie for Holidays or ANY time,1355529600,"12 15, 2012",2012,2257,"['Bishop', 'Wife', 'one', 'classics', '40', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'so', 'spectacular', 'Not', 'scope', 'i.e', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'heart', 'original', 'Black', 'White', 'prefer', 'bit', 'grainy', 'softness', 'warm', 'inviting', 'softness', 'characters', 'great', 'script', 'great', 'dialog', 'wonderfully', 'directed.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'plot', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'experience', 'will', 'mention', 'cast', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'role', 'Dudley', 'perfectly', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'more', 'graceful', 'gracious', 'elegant', 'caring', 'loving', 'THE', 'ultimate', 'angel', 'David', 'Niven', 'perfect', 'fit', 'role', 'Bishop', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'struggling', 'man', 'cloth', 'who', 'gone', 'slightly', 'direction', 'divine', 'help', 'get', 'back', 'track.Loretta', 'Young', 'Almost', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'perfect', 'wife', '1940', 'bishop', 'Supportive', 'kind', 'loving', 'so', 'worried', 'marriage', 'difficulties', 'distancing', 'husband', 'Niven', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fix', 'Beautiful', 'innocent', 'performance.Monty', 'Wooley', 'professor', 'sort', 'Everyman', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'knocked', 'life', 'experience', 'are', 'need', 'inspiration', 'then', 'Dudley', 'Grant', 'most', 'delightful', 'way', 'Charming', 'performance.Gladys', 'Cooper', 'elderly', 'dowager', 'richer', 'entire', 'town', 'great', 'performance', 'character', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'old', 'biddy', 'Now', 'Voyager', 'not', 'sharp', 'cruel', 'still', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'headstrong', 'proud', 'arrogant', 'Dudley', 'Grant', 'heart', 'gentleness', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'stellar', 'performances', 'film', 'especially', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'James', 'Gleason.While', 'film', 'definite', 'religious', 'overtone', 'respectful', 'not', 'get', 'preachy', 'kind', 'gentle', 'movie', 'more', 'unconditional', 'love', 'hope', 'can', 'go', 'right', 'world', 'only', 'would', 'relax', 'bit', 'see', 'true', 'value', 'other', 'relationships.This', 'charming', 'classic', 'movie', 'wish', 'were', 'films', 'being', 'made', 'today', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

This beautifully directed 1940's black and white Christmas movie is charming and heartwarming.Church Bishop Henry Brougham (David Niven) wants to build a new and bigger church in the worst way. He is even willing to kowtow to rich demanding congregation members to get funding.  Loretta Young as his lovely and somewhat neglected wife Julia, understands how badly her husband wants his new church but she doesn't want him to forget why he became a Bishop and to remember where his real duties lie. In desperation Henry prays for help and guidance. Help comes to him in form of a handsome, debonair and somewhat irreverent angel named Dudley, played superbly by Cary Grant. Grant arrives and immediately steals the heart of Henry's young daughter as well as the hearts of his secretary, maid and wife. When Henry cancels an appointment to hear young members in his congregation sing, Dudley goes instead. Dudley also encourages Julia to buy a rakish hat she admires, he takes her dining and dancing and wins over the disapproving church members who see them together. It seems that angel Dudley can do no wrong, everyone loves him, except Henry who starts to wonder if Dudley really is an angel and what is  his real purpose here. David Niven as the somewhat uptight Bishop was the right choice for this role.There are so many wonderful scenes in this movie. Dudley magically types letters and stuffs envelopes so Henry's secretary can leave the office early  to do Christmas shopping; he decorates the tree that the fluttering maid (a very young Elsa Lanchester) has just started to trim; and he has taxi driver, James Gleason, ice skating like an Olympic champion. When the boys won't let Julia's daughter play catch because she throws like a girl, Dudley steps in to give her a good pitching arm. Monty Woolley as the Professor who suspects that Dudley is a VERY special person is simply wonderful.This is the perfect story for all faiths.Vannie(~.~)",5,A Christmas Present,1029024000,"08 11, 2002",2002,1971,"['Bishop', 'Wife', 'beautifully', 'directed', '1940', 'black', 'white', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'charming', 'heartwarming.Church', 'Bishop', 'Henry', 'Brougham', 'David', 'Niven', 'build', 'new', 'bigger', 'church', 'worst', 'way', 'even', 'willing', 'kowtow', 'rich', 'demanding', 'congregation', 'members', 'get', 'funding', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'lovely', 'somewhat', 'neglected', 'wife', 'Julia', 'how', 'badly', 'husband', 'new', 'church', ""n't"", 'want', 'forget', 'why', 'became', 'Bishop', 'remember', 'where', 'real', 'duties', 'lie', 'desperation', 'Henry', 'help', 'guidance', 'Help', 'form', 'handsome', 'debonair', 'somewhat', 'irreverent', 'angel', 'named', 'Dudley', 'played', 'superbly', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Grant', 'immediately', 'heart', 'Henry', 'young', 'daughter', 'as', 'well', 'hearts', 'secretary', 'maid', 'wife', 'When', 'Henry', 'appointment', 'hear', 'young', 'members', 'congregation', 'sing', 'Dudley', 'instead', 'Dudley', 'also', 'Julia', 'buy', 'rakish', 'hat', 'dining', 'dancing', 'wins', 'disapproving', 'church', 'members', 'who', 'see', 'together', 'angel', 'Dudley', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'everyone', 'Henry', 'who', 'wonder', 'Dudley', 'really', 'angel', 'what', 'real', 'purpose', 'here', 'David', 'Niven', 'somewhat', 'uptight', 'Bishop', 'was', 'right', 'choice', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Dudley', 'magically', 'letters', 'stuffs', 'envelopes', 'so', 'Henry', 'secretary', 'can', 'leave', 'office', 'early', 'do', 'Christmas', 'shopping', 'tree', 'fluttering', 'maid', 'very', 'young', 'Elsa', 'Lanchester', 'just', 'started', 'trim', 'taxi', 'driver', 'James', 'Gleason', 'ice', 'skating', 'Olympic', 'champion', 'When', 'boys', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'Julia', 'daughter', 'play', 'catch', 'girl', 'Dudley', 'steps', 'give', 'good', 'pitching', 'arm', 'Monty', 'Woolley', 'Professor', 'who', 'Dudley', 'VERY', 'special', 'person', 'simply', 'wonderful.This', 'perfect', 'story', 'faiths.Vannie', '~.~']",N/A

So starts our film with a bishop who asks for help from the almighty to build a cathedral. The problem is that his major benefactor wants the church built like a Mausoluem for her departed husband. To top that off our dear Bishop has been trying so hard to get his cathedral build that he has forgotten about his wife and daughter. Help comes in the form of Dudley the Angel, charmingly portrayed by Cary Grant. This is a wonderful role for Grant, who was originally slated to play the Bishop with Niven in the role of the angel. One chat between Grant and the director caused  a switch which, in turn, created a magical film. I can't imagine anyone else in the role of Dudley the Angel. You can almost see how much Cary Grant enjoys playing the Angel. Anyway, I won't ruin the rest of the movie for you accept to say that Dudley is there to help the Bishop. Thing is that the Bishop thinks Dudley is their to help him build the Cathedral. Dudley has come to aid the bishop and give him the help he needs. The bishop just doesn't realize where the help is needed.My recommendation is to rent this movie for now.This movie was shot in letterbox but is presented in Pan & Scan. Many of us are discriminating collectors that cherish the original format that the movie was presented in. Why the studio chose to present this movie in Pan & Scan when it was clearly shot in letterbox, is beyond me. All movies made after 1945 were shot in Letterbox. This info is public knowledge.
