Yes, there is action, yet it is also a thriller, and a drama flick. There are a few action sequences which are good, but these are not as numerous as we action buffs would like. Before you know it, the story starts spending a lot of time on the relationship between Colin Farrell and Noomi Rapace, but their awkward characters keep us asking for a long time just where this relationship is going, hoping that something will develop sooner rather than later. On the other hand, when we see the bad guys we know they are really bad---they all play their parts very well. Because this film encompasses three genres, I feel that it is more prudent to rate each one separately to do more justice to the movie as a whole. I give the action part a B+, the thriller part a B-, and the drama portion a C+. The thing that saves this film for me is the excellent acting shown by the entire cast, in spite of the constrained roles assigned to them. Noomi Rapace's interesting character elicits empathy and compassion, yet the writers and director did not develop it as they should have. Maybe because the writers and director had to attend to the thriller and action aspects too. In my opinion this was probably two good story plots mixed in one---much like mixing a great orange juice with a tasty chocolate milk. Both excellent drinks will suffer.

Here are 2 people who have been betrayed and broken down by the world that they hide their true selves from everyone but learn to move forward with each other.  This was the main story that drove the movie, and the action revenge plot that Colin Farrell's character is taking is the secondary story line.  That part plays out with a satisfactory ending, how Farrell's character was able to pull it off though, was just a little unbelievable.

Then came the tormented love. I had heard of it before but this was the first time I saw it in a movie. She made it look so real it was very unsettling.Whenever Colin Farrell looked at her, he looked so focused and haunting that it made me feel uncomfortable and perplexed.This picture also covered friendship and revenge.The 3 twists at the end made it suspenseful, and entertaining.The action scenes were decisive, and exciting.Of course, there were some logical holes but they did not affect the entertaining value of this movie.After it finished, I felt the love was only one way.

Sawin,"[5, 8]","A paranoid mob boss named Alphonse (Terrence Howard) is looking to expand his territory, but is currently distracted by an unknown assailant taking out his men and mailing him strange pictures to rub salt in the wound. His right hand man Victor (Colin Farrell) falls into the seducing grasp of his neighbor Beatrice (Noomi Rapace), who blackmails Victor into helping her rid of the man who's responsible for leaving her disfigured and destroying her life, which meddles with Victor's own vengeful agenda.""Dead Man Down"" is directed by Niels Arden Oplev, the man who brought us the original ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" It's his first English-language film and it reunites him with Swedish actress Noomi Rapace. What some don't realize is that ""Dead Man Down"" is actually a WWE Studios production; a production studio that was formerly notorious for casting wrestlers in starring roles. Stu Bennett, also known as Wade Barrett in WWE, has a supporting role in ""Dead Man Down.""The crime thriller attempts to establish this neo-noir style, but basically reveals everything too early. So by the time other characters stumble onto the truth the audience has already known about it for well over an hour and it never really has that sense of mystery that could have added that extra spark it needed to be better than average.The cast seems somewhat remarkable at first glance, but is a bit of a letdown overall. Most of the film rests on the shoulders of Colin Farrell and Noomi Rapace, but they never quite mesh properly on-screen together. Farrell shows a moment of passion when he reveals his identity to a hostage and is at his strongest when he's watching home movies in his apartment where he lets his eyes do all the talking, but is mostly forgettable the rest of the time. Rapace has made a career out of playing damaged characters, so she's at her best when she's threatening Victor into helping her or the moments when she breaks down from coping with her disfigurement. Terrence Howard is unintentionally hilarious as his high pitched cursing will make you laugh out loud. The most surprising additions are Dominic Cooper as one of Alphonse's men who's constantly playing detective and a brief appearance by Armand Assante as one of Alphonse's investors who suddenly has second thoughts.There's a scene in the middle of the film where the camera kind of teeter-totters slowly while Victor and Alphonse talk to one another. This scene is like a metaphor for the entire film. On one hand, the film establishes several striking shots even though the film seems to purposely reside in this thick fog of darkness; the staircase sequence and the fireflies in the graveyard are visually fascinating. Imagine a sloth trying to sludge through a mud puddle and you've got an idea of how the film progresses. Despite its pace being extremely slow, there's this tense atmosphere and the conversations between Victor and Beatrice and Alphonse and Victor are intriguing despite never really going anywhere.On the other hand, it seems like the film is trying to sabotage itself at times. The first big action sequence in the film doesn't have a very big impact because they decided to have it dance along to dubstep, which doesn't work at all and just makes everything feel out of place. What little logic the film had is thrown out the window in the final act. Why settle on a plan that's been carefully constructed from the ground up for months when we can settle for something more spontaneous and impulsive?""Dead Man Down"" is really sluggish at first, but tends to be really compelling in this overpowering ""so bad it's good"" kind of way. The story is a tale of revenge coiled inside another tale of revenge wrapped around a power struggle, so things get more than a little convoluted at times. Its explosive finale tries to live up to the rest of the film's slow building nature, but is mostly just impotent.

Laslo's daughter was killed by a stray bullet, his wife murdered when they decided to serve as witnesses.  Laslo himself is left for dead, but seeks his revenge by slowly murdering members of Alphonse's crew.  His plan is going perfectly...until the neighbor across the way, Beatrice, sees something she shouldn't.  Except Beatrice doesn't go to the police; wounded in a car crash, she blackmails Victor/Laslo into killing the man who ruined her life.  Meanwhile, Alphonse is slowly putting the pieces (literally) together, and all the clocks are ticking towards the inevitable showdown.For its first two-thirds, DEAD MAN DOWN is an interesting film.  It starts off with a great shootout, and there are other bursts of action throughout that are well-timed, well-shot, and truly engaging.  The violence is quick and brutal; there's a particular scene, little over halfway through, that isn't altogether graphic, but really gets under your skin.  That's what DEAD MAN seems to be about, at first--burrowing under there.  You go in expecting a typical revenge/gangster flick, and instead you find yourself in the messed up world of director Niels Arden Oplev, who gave us the original THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO film.  Colin Farrell's brooding Victor/Laslo is an interesting character, at moments totally sympathetic, other times completely repugnant.  The same goes for Noomi Rapace's Beatrice, who oddly comes off as the least interesting of the pair; this is through no fault of the actress, who as always is nearly flawless, and captures some truly poignant moments with merely a look.  Terence Howard, as Alphonse, is the epitome of despicable cool.  Kudos go to supporting actors Dominic Cooper, as a fellow henchman with ambitions, and F. Murray Abraham as Laslo's confidant.  And pay close attention to Armand Assante, who continues a quasi-late career comeback in his role as the aging gangster; in his sole scene, he conveys a nice tone of subdued rage, making one wish he had a greater role.The film slowly falls apart in its third act, coincidentally as Victor/Laslo's plan begins to crumble.  The final shootout is exhilarating in many aspects, but begins shallowly and ends on an empty note.  Honestly, and I hate to say it because Rapace does such an amazing job with what she's given, but the Beatrice character is almost obsolete; yes, Rapace and Farrell have an interesting chemistry which is fun to watch, but her portion of the film weighs the plot down, ultimately becoming the ""damsel in distress"" role that clearly both Beatrice and Rapace are better than.  DEAD MAN DOWN ultimately ends up undermining many of its own ambitions...and yet, it's definitely worth a watch or two, as it features some fine performances, some great action scenes, and some truly unsettling, morally ambiguous questions that are as relevant today as they ever have been.  Plus, for the most part, it's just a well-made film.",4,A brooding drama with some bouts of furious action.,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,3051,"['Victor', 'enforcer', 'Alphonse', 'little', 'mob/real', 'estate', 'group', 'Victor', 'also', 'Laslo', 'victim', 'Alphonse', 'violence', 'Laslo', 'daughter', 'was', 'killed', 'stray', 'bullet', 'wife', 'murdered', 'when', 'decided', 'serve', 'witnesses', 'Laslo', 'left', 'dead', 'revenge', 'slowly', 'murdering', 'members', 'Alphonse', 'crew', 'plan', 'going', 'perfectly', 'neighbor', 'way', 'Beatrice', 'something', 'should', ""n't"", 'Beatrice', ""n't"", 'go', 'police', 'wounded', 'car', 'crash', 'Victor/Laslo', 'killing', 'man', 'who', 'ruined', 'life', 'Meanwhile', 'Alphonse', 'slowly', 'putting', 'pieces', 'literally', 'together', 'clocks', 'are', 'ticking', 'inevitable', 'showdown.For', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'DEAD', 'MAN', 'DOWN', 'interesting', 'film', 'great', 'shootout', 'are', 'other', 'bursts', 'action', 'are', 'well-timed', 'well-shot', 'truly', 'engaging', 'violence', 'quick', 'brutal', 'particular', 'scene', 'little', 'halfway', ""n't"", 'altogether', 'graphic', 'really', 'skin', 'what', 'DEAD', 'MAN', 'be', 'about', 'first', 'burrowing', 'there', 'go', 'expecting', 'typical', 'revenge/gangster', 'flick', 'instead', 'find', 'messed', 'up', 'world', 'director', 'Niels', 'Arden', 'Oplev', 'who', 'gave', 'original', 'THE', 'GIRL', 'WITH', 'THE', 'DRAGON', 'TATTOO', 'film', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'brooding', 'Victor/Laslo', 'interesting', 'character', 'moments', 'totally', 'sympathetic', 'other', 'times', 'completely', 'repugnant', 'same', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'Beatrice', 'who', 'oddly', 'off', 'least', 'interesting', 'pair', 'fault', 'actress', 'who', 'always', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'truly', 'poignant', 'moments', 'merely', 'look', 'Terence', 'Howard', 'Alphonse', 'epitome', 'despicable', 'cool', 'Kudos', 'go', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'fellow', 'henchman', 'ambitions', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'Laslo', 'confidant', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'who', 'quasi-late', 'career', 'comeback', 'role', 'aging', 'gangster', 'sole', 'scene', 'nice', 'tone', 'subdued', 'rage', 'making', 'one', 'wish', 'had', 'greater', 'role.The', 'film', 'slowly', 'apart', 'third', 'act', 'coincidentally', 'Victor/Laslo', 'plan', 'crumble', 'final', 'shootout', 'exhilarating', 'many', 'aspects', 'shallowly', 'empty', 'note', 'Honestly', 'hate', 'say', 'because', 'Rapace', 'amazing', 'job', 'what', 'given', 'Beatrice', 'character', 'almost', 'obsolete', 'yes', 'Rapace', 'Farrell', 'have', 'interesting', 'chemistry', 'fun', 'watch', 'portion', 'film', 'plot', 'down', 'ultimately', 'becoming', 'damsel', 'distress', 'role', 'clearly', 'Beatrice', 'Rapace', 'are', 'better', 'DEAD', 'MAN', 'DOWN', 'ultimately', 'up', 'undermining', 'many', 'own', 'ambitions', 'yet', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watch', 'two', 'fine', 'performances', 'great', 'action', 'scenes', 'truly', 'unsettling', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'questions', 'are', 'relevant', 'today', 'ever', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'part', 'just', 'well-made', 'film']",N/A

It would have so much better if Victor (Farrell) had found a more unexpected and innovative way to play the  Jamaicans and the Albanians off against each other. Along with said premise, the fine performances by Farrell, Noomi Rapace, Dominic Cooper, and many of the supporting cast help to redeem this film, as does the fine cinematography--some really good shots of NYC. The eclectic international soundtrack also adds something.There are many stretches and inconsistencies here; e.g., Beatrice's scars aren't all that horrible, and she's still quite attractive, so why is she labeled a ""monster""? Though it might have killed the sex appeal, it would have been a bolder, more interesting move if her face had been horribly mangled in the auto accident, which would still not hinder the relationship she winds up sharing with Victor. {After all, they are two ""wounded"" people.} The way they meet via Beatrice's initial blackmail is also a little hard to buy.DEAD MAN DOWN should appeal decently enough to those just wanting a thriller.

Though ""Dead Man Down"" might not be quite as good, it's still a heck of an outing.Here's the scoop. Beatrice (Noomi Rapace) is left scarred after a car accident. She has seen her neighbor, Victor (Colin Farrell), kill someone, so she figures she can hire/blackmail him to kill the guy who ruined her face. Victor, as it turns out, is an enforcer for some bad guys, but they're having their own problems with a mystery person who is sending them cryptic, ominous messages. So how will this all play out?This is a heck of a set-up. Oplev seems to purposely be obscuring location in the beginning. You start with Terrance Howard, an African American, speaking some Latin dialect to some people. Then you have Beatrice's mom speaking French, and Victor speaking Albanian. Maybe he's saying this could be taking place anywhere beside New York. Add to that the Terrance Howard character trying to figure out who's dogging him and why. It took me a while to get my footing. Enter Beatrice and Victor. She's scarred on the outside and he on the inside from an incident that happened some while earlier. And the story itself is pretty cool. As I mentioned, I was pretty wobbly in the beginning. But, piece by piece, the puzzle started coming together both on the plot side as well as the relationship side. I was satisfied.I like Colin Farrell but he (or his agent) has a knack for picking iffy roles. This was a good role for him and he did a sweet job. I've seen Noomi Rapace in a few films and I like her more and more each time I see her. Terrance Howard still fails to impress me.

1590915,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B009AMAJPA,FNDNreview,"[3, 7]","Produced by WWE Studios and directed by Niels Arden Oplev (The `original' Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), Dead Man Down stars Colin Farrell as Victor, an up-and-coming member of the mob that secretly infiltrates the organization for one specific reason:  revenge on its leader, Alphonse Hoyt (Terrence Howard).  While implementing his master plan, Victor is approached by Beatrice (Noomi Rapace), a recent car accident victim with scars on her face, who is also seeking revenge against the random drunk driver that caused her car accident.  Now, Victor must balance executing his master plan with helping Beatice with her revenge - all while trying to keep his mobster friend, Darcy (Dominic Cooper) from uncovering his plot.  Isabelle Huppert, F. Murray Abraham, and WWE superstar, Wade Barrett, also star in supporting roles.Even though this is Colin Farrell's best film in the last few years, that's not really all that great of a compliment - it's more of a knock on the poor roles he's been taking, including the leading spot in Seven Psychopaths and the Total Recall remake.  In his role as Victor, Farrell plays the silent assassin, making for very few lines - but it works out well as he does the majority of his talking with his eyes and guns.  The serious tone of this character is very similar to the roles Farrell portrayed in S.W.A.T and The Recruit, which are just a few of the most notable roles in his career.  And, while this role in Dead Man Down is silently entertaining, at some point Farrell needs to start attempting roles that are far more interesting and complex.  Obviously, Farrell has leading-man power behind him, but he continues to limit his potential by not stepping outside his comfort zone as an actor.Dead Man Down is a relatively uneventful plot in the realm of trying new things.  The act of revenge by the main character has been the basis of a film more times than anyone can count - not to mention adding in the supporting actress character trying to push him towards redemption.  Films of this nature need to have a strong villain to help drive the hero, but this story provides a weak, aloof villain with Dominic Cooper.  After discovering the hero's reason for revenge, this film is instantly comparable to The Punisher films/comic book character, and while The Punisher itself was by no means a memorable film (any of its renditions), Colin Farrell's character still solidifies itself as a proverbial knockoff.Overall, Dead Man Down is a film that lacks originality - but it won't completely deprive viewers of entertainment.  There is just enough action and interest spread throughout the sloppy plot to earn itself the `action' label.  At the end of the day, what more would you expect from a WWE Production that typically features John Cena as the main attraction?Overall Film Grade:  C-FNDNreview.com",2,Farrell silently seeks revenge in 'Dead Man Down',1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,2845,"['Produced', 'WWE', 'Studios', 'directed', 'Niels', 'Arden', 'Oplev', 'original', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Down', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Victor', 'up-and-coming', 'member', 'mob', 'secretly', 'organization', 'one', 'specific', 'reason', 'revenge', 'leader', 'Alphonse', 'Hoyt', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'implementing', 'master', 'plan', 'Victor', 'approached', 'Beatrice', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'recent', 'car', 'accident', 'victim', 'scars', 'face', 'who', 'also', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'random', 'drunk', 'driver', 'caused', 'car', 'accident', 'Now', 'Victor', 'must', 'balance', 'executing', 'master', 'plan', 'helping', 'Beatice', 'revenge', 'trying', 'keep', 'mobster', 'friend', 'Darcy', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'uncovering', 'plot', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'WWE', 'superstar', 'Wade', 'Barrett', 'also', 'star', 'supporting', 'roles.Even', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'best', 'film', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'not', 'really', 'great', 'compliment', 'more', 'knock', 'poor', 'roles', 'been', 'taking', 'including', 'leading', 'spot', 'Seven', 'Psychopaths', 'Total', 'Recall', 'remake', 'role', 'Victor', 'Farrell', 'silent', 'assassin', 'making', 'very', 'few', 'lines', 'out', 'well', 'majority', 'talking', 'eyes', 'guns', 'serious', 'tone', 'character', 'very', 'similar', 'roles', 'Farrell', 'portrayed', 'S.W.A.T', 'Recruit', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'most', 'notable', 'roles', 'career', 'role', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Down', 'silently', 'entertaining', 'point', 'Farrell', 'start', 'attempting', 'roles', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'complex', 'Obviously', 'Farrell', 'leading-man', 'power', 'limit', 'potential', 'not', 'stepping', 'comfort', 'zone', 'actor.Dead', 'Man', 'Down', 'relatively', 'uneventful', 'plot', 'realm', 'trying', 'new', 'things', 'act', 'revenge', 'main', 'character', 'been', 'basis', 'film', 'more', 'times', 'anyone', 'can', 'count', 'not', 'mention', 'adding', 'supporting', 'actress', 'character', 'trying', 'push', 'towards', 'redemption', 'Films', 'nature', 'need', 'have', 'strong', 'villain', 'help', 'drive', 'hero', 'story', 'weak', 'aloof', 'villain', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'discovering', 'hero', 'reason', 'revenge', 'film', 'instantly', 'comparable', 'Punisher', 'films/comic', 'book', 'character', 'Punisher', 'was', 'memorable', 'film', 'renditions', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'character', 'still', 'proverbial', 'knockoff.Overall', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Down', 'film', 'originality', 'wo', ""n't"", 'completely', 'deprive', 'viewers', 'entertainment', 'just', 'enough', 'action', 'interest', 'spread', 'sloppy', 'plot', 'earn', 'action', 'label', 'end', 'day', 'what', 'more', 'would', 'expect', 'WWE', 'Production', 'typically', 'John', 'Cena', 'main', 'attraction', 'Overall', 'Film', 'Grade', 'C-FNDNreview.com']",N/A

This was not the case, but even still, I was hoping it was at least interesting to watch.The set up was good.  Terrance Howard is a leader of an Albanian gang whose gang is losing its member one by one.  He gets puzzles and riddles from the assassin.  Dominic Cooper and Colin Farrell are part of the gang members and they are helping to try to find the culprit.  Unfortunately that just the beginning, but then the movie has a subplot which puts the movie in a dead stop.  Colin Farrell meets a car accident victim (Naomi Rapice)and she has a proposition for him.  Twist and Turns do occur and then some romance as well.  Towards the middle, nothing interesting happens at all.  It's not the romance that I didn't like, it just was a snoozefest.  I actually was beginning to fall asleep, which would be a first for me.The movie had too many deposition and not enough fast-paced scenes.  The trailer shows a lot of action scenes, but most of it is towards the end.  There's a major action sequence in the end, but to be honest, it actually felt out of place.

What starts out as a totally confusing and seemingly unrelated series of events ever so slowly comes together in a thoroughly riveting climax. Director Niels Arden Oplev's tale is methodically paced and ultimately mesmerizing as the story unfolds. Colin Farrell gives one of his best performances in a very underplayed characterization and Noomi Rapace is totally impulsive in her captivating performance opposite Farrell. Together they are amazingly convincing as the viewer never is given a chance to get a good read on these two actors who powerfully and so subtly reveal just bits and pieces of their broken and twisted lives that by happenstance place them on a singular road of salvation for their own humanity. To say too much would give the plot away, but by the end the entire experience gels in a visually cathartic conclusion.

The theme is not good guy versus bad guy because every character in the film is a bad guy/girl  and once the audience tunes into that then the emphasis is on that elusive human reaction to trauma called revenge.Victor (Colin Farrell) is a Hungarian immigrant whose wife and daughter were killed and he is out to destroy the Albanian crime gang that caused their death. He has infiltrated the crime empire run by ruthless kingpin Alphonse (Terrence Howard), with the single purpose of making Alphonse pay for destroying his once happy life. Victor's best friend is crime cohort Darcy (Dominic Cooper) whose obsessive curiosity about his friend opens the story for insertion of all manner of bad tings. As he meticulously orchestrates his vengeance from his high-rise home, Victor watches and is watched by Beatrice (Noomi Repace, a mysterious young woman, her face is disfigured from a car accident, who lives with her mother (Isabelle Huppert) in the apartment across from his. On the surface a fragile woman-child, Beatrice seethes with a rage of her own: she sees the death of the drunken driver who caused her facial excoriations and rebuilding attempts. When she uncovers Victor's dark secrets, she threatens to expose him unless he helps her carry out her own campaign of retribution. Each fixated on avenging the past, they devise a violent and cathartic plan that could change their worlds forever.One of the reasons this film works so well is that incredibly magnetic brooding presence of Colin Farrell, but the other reasons the story pushes along at a breakneck speed is the quality of the rest of the cast. Noomi Repace, Isabelle Huppert (still one of the finest actresses on the screen today), Dominic Cooper, Terrence Howard, Armand Assante, F. Murray Abraham, James Biberi, Luis Da Silva Jr., Stu Bennett, Franky G and all the members of this huge cast deliver well for director Opley.This is a dark film about the dark subject of revenge.

The film never really consummates the promised romance but instead focuses on two fragile characters who find rare moments of sanity to hold onto to avoid completely falling off an emotional cliff.The casting is excellent and there's a solid chemistry between all the major parts with everyone turning in good performances. The production design shows us a view of New York's suburbs that you rarely see with some dark, Euro coloration and generally the style supports the brooding atmosphere cultivated throughout the first two thirds of the film. The pacing is tight although it arguably loses the mystery element of the story too quickly and by the time act 3 starts, it's pretty clear where it's going to go. This is another film where you should avoid watching the trailer since far too much of the final 20 minutes is included and it's laden with spoilers.Dead Man Down died horribly at the box office, presumably due to the dreadful title, unclear premise and a feeling that we've seen it all before.

Of course, it's always interesting to watch a smart person tackle a tough problem and we often forget that Mr. Farrell is a wonderful actor.* Noomi Rapace (""Prometheus"") is a (formerly) lovely beautician whose life changed instantly when she was hit by a drunken driver.

From the trailers I first saw a few months ago the film looked like a really good action thriller yet there was no sign that WWE produced this film and I think that was purposely done by WWE Studios and the distributor studio in FilmDistrict. I mean when you bring up WWE Studios a good film certainly isn't the first thing that comes to mind. The only half way decent film they produced was The Condemned with Steve Austin. It was stupid fun thrill ride, but at best was a two and half to three star film, so I can understand why I didn't see the WWE's name openly attached to Dead Man Down. I think this was the first film WWE actually took seriously putting time and money into the film, and bringing in a good cast and director. Still when I learned that the WWE was a part of Dead Man Down a few days ago my expectations for the film dropped considerably, and I think that was a good thing because I was pleasantly surprised that Dead Man Down is a good film.The film starts off with Darcy (Dominic Cooper) showing off his newborn child to Victor (Colin Farrell) and telling him he finally realizes that humans weren't meant to be alone, and common thread to this revenge film that tries to deal with the themes of revenge what it does to people and whether getting revenge will get rid of the scars and pain that has been inflicted on us. What Darcy doesn't know is that Victor has infiltrated Darcy's gang run by the ruthless Alphonse Hoyt (Terrence Howard) to get revenge. Things get complicated for Victor when he meets another damaged soul in Beatrice (Noomi Rapace) across from him in another apartment building. The two bond as they are searching for revenge and in doing so slowly begin to live again. The story was written by J. H. Wyman who Fringe fans might recognize. He was a writer and eventual co-show runner, and even though I believe this is his first feature film it doesn't show as he did a good job with the script giving a great story. Is the pacing of the story perfect? No as there are dead moments that last a little too long and there is almost no depth to Alphonse character. Still Wyman wrote a good action/thriller.Colin Farrell is a strange actor. He has the potential to give good if not outstanding performances in films like Tigerland, Minority Report, Miami Vice and The New World, but he can also give really bad performances in film like Phone Booth, American Outlaws and Alexander. He's almost never consistent from film to film. I'm not sure whether he actually tries or it's the script that is bad. In any even his performance in Dead Man Down is one of his better acting jobs. Victor doesn't have a ton of dialog. Instead Colin brings facial expressions and emotion to the role as he deals with his feelings of revenge and you can see he begins to slowly doubt his purpose as he grows closer to Beatrice. Noomi Rapace fresh off her good performance in Prometheus gives another good acting job here in Dead Man Down as Beatrice a fiscally scarred woman caused by accident who is seeking revenge on the man who caused her accident. The small supporting cast also does a good job. Dominic Cooper does a good job playing Victor's friend. Isabelle Huppert does a splendid job playing Beatrice's mother and F. Murray Abraham does an excellent job in his small supporting role as Victor's uncle in law. Again the only flaw in was with Terrence Howard. He was supposed to give of this vibe of being a scary gangster, but Terrence doesn't do a great job. Also I am Armand Assante fan. He's a really good actor who only has a brief appearance in the film. I think he could have done a better job playing the bad guy than Terrence Howard did.Was there a ton of action in Dead Man Down? No there wasn't. You could say the trailers are a little miss leading in that department, but Dead Man Down is more of an action/drama/thriller. Still the action is riveting. From one scene in a Jamaican drug den. It was gritty thrilling and well down. There was another scene in an apartment building where Victor is trying to escape. It's well planned and thought out. I won't give anything else away because there isn't a ton of action, but all of it is well done. I wish films like Gangster Squad and Die Hard had gone this route because Dead Man Down's action is much better than those films.I don't know much about director Niels Arden Oplev. About all I know about him is that he directed the Swedish version of The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo which also starred Noomi Rapace and I never saw the film, so I have no knowledge or preconceived notions about the director. From watching Dead Man Down I can say that he is a good director. He does a good job directing both the action and drama and I believe he brought out the best in his actors. There was another graduate from the Swedish Girl With The Dragon Tatoo series in composer Jacob Groth. Is the music great? No, but Groth does do a good job fitting the music to each scene.I know the mention of WWE might make people hesitant about seeing this film. I know it did for me and I'm sure this will be an anomaly for WWE Studios, but Dead Man Down is a good film with a decent cast, good acting, riveting action, a detailed story about revenge and finding the will to live again along with a good director and a decent score. Give Dead Man Down a try. Don't let the WWE scare you and I think you will be pleasantly surprised.",4,WWE Studios made a good film.

1590935,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B009AMAJPA,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Death, sorrow, and struggle. These are the three main components of Dead Man Down; a film that revolves around the death of a man's family, the sorrow he feels because of it, and the struggle he must go through to get his revenge. While maybe not the most creative premise I've seen recently, Dead Man Down works because it's focused. A lot of films seem to deviate from the main plot in an effort to create something more well-rounded, but this usually ends up with the movie being a disaster. Dead Man Down, on the other hand, picks a lane and sticks to it. It wants you to feel for the two leads and, by the end of it, you probably will.You follow the story of Victor (Colin Farrell) and, later, Beatrice (Noomi Rapace). Victor's family was murdered a few years ago by some Albanians hired by a man named Alphonse Hoyt (Terrence Howard). Because they believed him to be dead, Victor was able to infiltrate Alphonse's gang in an effort to get close to him. He wants his revenge on not only Alphonse, but the Albanians as well. Beatrice lives in the apartment complex across the street from him. After witnessing him kill a man, Beatrice blackmails Victor because she wants him to kill someone for her - a man who was driving under the influence and crashed into her, leaving her face ruined.While I do feel that Beatrice wasn't exactly essential to the story, her presence doesn't really derail the movie in any way. In fact, some of the writing that involved both Victor and Beatrice was actually very clever. However, she was also the reason for one of Dead Man Down's biggest flaws, the way it ended. You see, while Beatrice and Victor make an enjoyable team, I don't think sacrificing a strong ending for the inclusion of a female lead was a good move. There's a point in the movie where all of Victor's plans are going according to plan and had they ended it right then and there the ending would have been more impactful.Instead, they took the generic route and had a huge firefight while Victor attempts to save the damsel in distress. Now, this is the same issue I had with Jack Reacher a few months back. You had an action-thriller that went against the grain and provided some intelligent writing, but they ruined it by having your run-of-the-mill ending. While Dead Man Down's previous moments aren't as great as Jack Reacher's, the same concept applies. It's obvious that they chose to end the film the way they did because the writer felt like it had to end that way given the genre. Unfortunately, the ending just didn't do it for me and it kind of ruined everything that preceded it.Other than that, though, Dead Man Down was surprisingly enjoyable. I had pretty low expectations based on the trailer, but I enjoy Colin Farrell so I figured I would give it a shot. It's raw and gritty while at the same time feeling honest and humane. Both Victor and Beatrice are going through some hard times and they're ultimately there to help each other through them. It starts as a man and a woman wanting revenge, but ends with two people realizing that they're not necessarily the only people going through a hard time. Also, the film has some pretty excellent pacing and a few comedic moments that help balance everything out.Overall I felt the casting was very well done. Colin Farrell, in particular, did a great job as Victor. His ability to bring out this character's struggle through mere facial expressions was outstanding and it seemed as if you could actually see the pain in his eyes. Rapace's performance was spot on as well. Both of these actors were playing some tough roles, but they both did an excellent job. Also, Terrence Howard constantly seems to be improving his skill as an actor. In the past I've always felt his performances were a little shaky, but he seems more confident and comfortable and it shows in his performance as Alphonse.Overall Score: 7/10 - While I don't think Dead Man Down would have been the greatest film ever made even with the proper ending, it wouldn't have hurt to try. Everything leading up to its closing moments was really solid and the story kept me engaged the entire time, but the ending just felt extremely out of place given the emotional context of the film. Still, it's an enjoyable experience and one I would recommend if you were looking to check it out.",4,"7/10 - Good story, unsatisfying ending.",1373846400,"07 15, 2013",2013,4370,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.Death', 'sorrow', 'struggle', 'are', 'three', 'main', 'components', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Down', 'film', 'death', 'man', 'family', 'sorrow', 'struggle', 'must', 'go', 'get', 'revenge', 'maybe', 'not', 'most', 'creative', 'premise', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Down', 'focused', 'lot', 'films', 'seem', 'deviate', 'main', 'plot', 'effort', 'create', 'something', 'more', 'well-rounded', 'usually', 'up', 'movie', 'being', 'disaster', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Down', 'other', 'hand', 'lane', 'sticks', 'feel', 'two', 'leads', 'end', 'probably', 'will.You', 'follow', 'story', 'Victor', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'later', 'Beatrice', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'Victor', 'family', 'was', 'murdered', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Albanians', 'hired', 'man', 'named', 'Alphonse', 'Hoyt', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'believed', 'be', 'dead', 'Victor', 'was', 'able', 'infiltrate', 'Alphonse', 'gang', 'effort', 'get', 'close', 'revenge', 'not', 'only', 'Alphonse', 'Albanians', 'as', 'well', 'Beatrice', 'apartment', 'complex', 'street', 'witnessing', 'kill', 'man', 'Beatrice', 'Victor', 'kill', 'someone', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'driving', 'influence', 'crashed', 'leaving', 'face', 'ruined.While', 'do', 'feel', 'Beatrice', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'essential', 'story', 'presence', ""n't"", 'really', 'derail', 'movie', 'way', 'fact', 'writing', 'involved', 'Victor', 'Beatrice', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'clever', 'However', 'was', 'also', 'reason', 'one', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Down', 'biggest', 'flaws', 'way', 'ended', 'see', 'Beatrice', 'Victor', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'team', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'sacrificing', 'strong', 'ending', 'inclusion', 'female', 'lead', 'was', 'good', 'move', 'point', 'movie', 'where', 'Victor', 'plans', 'are', 'going', 'according', 'plan', 'had', 'ended', 'right', 'then', 'there', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'impactful.Instead', 'took', 'generic', 'route', 'had', 'huge', 'firefight', 'Victor', 'attempts', 'save', 'damsel', 'distress', 'Now', 'same', 'issue', 'had', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'few', 'months', 'back', 'had', 'action-thriller', 'went', 'grain', 'provided', 'intelligent', 'writing', 'ruined', 'having', 'run-of-the-mill', 'ending', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Down', 'previous', 'moments', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'Jack', 'Reacher', 'same', 'concept', 'applies', 'obvious', 'chose', 'end', 'film', 'way', 'did', 'writer', 'felt', 'had', 'end', 'way', 'given', 'genre', 'Unfortunately', 'ending', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'kind', 'ruined', 'everything', 'preceded', 'it.Other', 'though', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Down', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'enjoyable', 'had', 'pretty', 'low', 'expectations', 'based', 'trailer', 'enjoy', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'figured', 'would', 'give', 'shot', 'raw', 'gritty', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'feeling', 'honest', 'humane', 'Victor', 'Beatrice', 'are', 'going', 'hard', 'times', ""'re"", 'ultimately', 'there', 'help', 'other', 'man', 'woman', 'wanting', 'revenge', 'two', 'people', 'realizing', ""'re"", 'not', 'necessarily', 'only', 'people', 'going', 'hard', 'time', 'Also', 'film', 'pretty', 'excellent', 'pacing', 'few', 'comedic', 'moments', 'help', 'balance', 'everything', 'out.Overall', 'felt', 'casting', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'particular', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Victor', 'ability', 'bring', 'out', 'character', 'struggle', 'mere', 'facial', 'expressions', 'was', 'outstanding', 'seemed', 'could', 'actually', 'see', 'pain', 'eyes', 'Rapace', 'performance', 'was', 'spot', 'as', 'well', 'actors', 'were', 'playing', 'tough', 'roles', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'Also', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'constantly', 'be', 'improving', 'skill', 'actor', 'past', ""'ve"", 'always', 'felt', 'performances', 'were', 'little', 'shaky', 'more', 'confident', 'comfortable', 'performance', 'Alphonse.Overall', 'Score', '7/10', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Down', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'greatest', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'even', 'proper', 'ending', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'hurt', 'try', 'Everything', 'leading', 'up', 'closing', 'moments', 'was', 'really', 'solid', 'story', 'kept', 'engaged', 'entire', 'time', 'ending', 'just', 'felt', 'extremely', 'place', 'given', 'emotional', 'context', 'film', 'Still', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'one', 'would', 'recommend', 'were', 'looking', 'check', 'out']",N/A

However, there are different kinds of revenge movies.  In fact one writer, Grady Harp, whose reviews I most often highly respect, makes mention that in the case of the movie, Dead Man Down,""The theme is not good guy versus bad guy because every character in the film is a bad guy/girl and once the audience tunes into that then the emphasis is on that elusive human reaction to trauma called revenge.""What?  No good guys?  This is a movie and movies relate to real life. Right? When the Twin Towers went down we wanted revenge.  Did that make us bad?  Our military went to war and most all of us were behind that action.  I'm just saying, when there is any kind of rational justification we, as human beings, tend to want retribution. However, we hope for reasonable resolution, in real life.  In movies, we want gruesome revenge and yet, still consider the protagonist righteous.Between the director of Dead Man Down, Niels Arden Oplev, and the actors, Collin Farrell and Noomi Rapace, the spirit and humanity of these vengeful characters were culled with insight and care.  Two youngish actors, both masters of the dark, far-off stare, make a connection across the ethereal space between two apartment buildings and the souls of their characters, as well as their histories, collide.  This is an artfully convoluted plot, making sense at each surprising turn.  Isabelle Huppert, as Rapace's mother, was diaphonously present, blithely beautiful and childlike.Terrence Howard, as evil incarnate, did not altogether satisfy.  While I didn't need to see an overacting madman, I would like to have seen him use those nice cold blue eyes to convey more danger.  Instead, it seemed as though he whined his anger and discontent more often than not.Dominic Cooper, a Brit, sporting a Bronx accent, was a surprise.  His character was paradoxical and he certainly did it justice.*SPOILERRight up until the very, very end, I was enjoying myself.  The soundtracks, the cinematography, the New York and surrounding area location, the acting and THEN...

A slow mental and emotional torture as his tormentor makes it clear that a fresh grave awaits him - and it won't be quick or painless.The boss obviously crossed the wrong man. But who is he?The wronged man could easily kill his target quickly and be done with it; his logistical and intelligence support suggests that very course of action. Warning that as he spends more and more time torturing, his position becomes more and more vulnerable. The potential for exposure and discovery equals failure.But the wronged man wants, needs, to torment the people responsible for the death of his wife and little girl. Delivering unyielding misery is his only mission in life. He refuses to give them death until he chooses the time, place, and conditions. Until then - constant terror is the order of the day.As he continues to manipulate his fellow gang members, Victor starts up an unlikely friendship with a lonely woman who lives on the same floor of an adjacent high-rise building. Beginning with silent acknowledgments of greetings and motions of hello, their non-verbal contact soon moves to an actual sit down meal. It becomes immediately clear that she's hurt - not just physically, which is obvious given her terribly scarred face, but hurt because her soul is broken.The woman tells him her story. A repeat drunk driver crashed into her car. More than just taking away her beauty, he took away her livelihood as a beautician. Worse, he simultaneously took away her self-esteem and sense of justice - because he got off with a slap on the wrist. She still sees him - sucking alcohol at the very same bar - continuing to live his life as if nothing had happened.Her intense pain is something he recognizes and sympathizes with; they share the same grief.As the pair cautiously rediscovers love in their wrecked lives - Beatrice is unexpectedly drawn into Victor's world. Impetuously, and perhaps because of her growing feelings, helps him maintain his cover story. As he realizes that she can be trusted - tells her the truth about who he really is and what he's really doing.Stunned, he discovers that she carries her own dark seed.The price for her continued silence is something he didn't see coming, but he should have.He has to kill the drunk who destroyed her life - or he has to kill her. One or the other, but the suffering has to come to an end.This dark screenplay gracefully reveals human kindness and love amidst the sad sorrow of loss and the ugliness of revenge.One of the better Colin Farrell films I've seen in quite a while. No question the man is talented - none. But he's also known for having done some real stinkers in his career - 'Alexander', 'Miami Vice', 'Daredevil' - just to name a few. And just as you're convinced he's completely rudderless - he does something really good, like this film or something like 'In Bruges', resetting one's level of expectation. A very difficult actor to predict.Finally, I've said this before: I am truly and genuinely stunned at the achievements of WWE Studios. Once upon a time a laughable arm of the McMahon empire - it's become a serious player in the independent film industry. This production only validates that they're moving up and away from their ridiculous roots into something very tangible. I see them taking the same path as Lionsgate Films.Quite the accomplishment for all involved.Solid five stars.",5,Graceful Darkness,1392508800,"02 16, 2014",2014,3748,"['edged', 'crime', 'thriller', 'opinion', 'very', 'rarified', 'plateau', 'cinema', 'American', 'director', 'creating', 'European', 'style', 'drama.Much', 'more', 'linear', 'action', 'flick', 'film', 'built', 'script', 'heavily', 'abilities', 'artists', 'breathe', 'life', 'characters.Tells', 'story', 'underworld', 'boss', 'who', 'been', 'targeted', 'death', 'slow', 'mental', 'emotional', 'torture', 'tormentor', 'clear', 'fresh', 'grave', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'quick', 'painless.The', 'boss', 'obviously', 'crossed', 'wrong', 'man', 'who', 'wronged', 'man', 'could', 'easily', 'kill', 'target', 'quickly', 'be', 'done', 'logistical', 'intelligence', 'support', 'very', 'course', 'action', 'Warning', 'more', 'more', 'time', 'torturing', 'position', 'more', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'potential', 'exposure', 'discovery', 'equals', 'failure.But', 'wronged', 'man', 'needs', 'torment', 'people', 'responsible', 'death', 'wife', 'little', 'girl', 'Delivering', 'unyielding', 'misery', 'only', 'mission', 'life', 'give', 'death', 'time', 'place', 'conditions', 'then', 'constant', 'terror', 'order', 'day.As', 'manipulate', 'fellow', 'gang', 'members', 'Victor', 'up', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'lonely', 'woman', 'who', 'same', 'floor', 'adjacent', 'high-rise', 'building', 'Beginning', 'silent', 'acknowledgments', 'greetings', 'motions', 'hello', 'non-verbal', 'contact', 'soon', 'actual', 'sit', 'down', 'meal', 'immediately', 'clear', 'hurt', 'not', 'just', 'physically', 'obvious', 'given', 'terribly', 'scarred', 'face', 'hurt', 'soul', 'broken.The', 'woman', 'story', 'repeat', 'drunk', 'driver', 'crashed', 'car', 'More', 'just', 'taking', 'away', 'beauty', 'took', 'away', 'livelihood', 'beautician', 'Worse', 'simultaneously', 'took', 'away', 'self-esteem', 'sense', 'justice', 'got', 'off', 'slap', 'wrist', 'still', 'sucking', 'alcohol', 'very', 'same', 'bar', 'continuing', 'live', 'life', 'nothing', 'had', 'happened.Her', 'intense', 'pain', 'something', 'share', 'same', 'grief.As', 'pair', 'cautiously', 'rediscovers', 'love', 'wrecked', 'lives', 'Beatrice', 'unexpectedly', 'drawn', 'Victor', 'world', 'Impetuously', 'perhaps', 'growing', 'feelings', 'maintain', 'cover', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'trusted', 'truth', 'who', 'really', 'what', 'really', 'doing.Stunned', 'own', 'dark', 'seed.The', 'price', 'continued', 'silence', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'should', 'have.He', 'kill', 'drunk', 'who', 'destroyed', 'life', 'kill', 'One', 'other', 'suffering', 'come', 'end.This', 'dark', 'screenplay', 'gracefully', 'human', 'kindness', 'love', 'amidst', 'sad', 'sorrow', 'loss', 'ugliness', 'revenge.One', 'better', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'while', 'question', 'man', 'talented', 'none', 'also', 'known', 'having', 'done', 'real', 'stinkers', 'career', ""'Alexander"", 'Vice', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'just', ""'re"", 'convinced', 'completely', 'rudderless', 'something', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'something', ""'In"", 'Bruges', 'resetting', 'one', 'level', 'expectation', 'very', 'difficult', 'actor', 'predict.Finally', ""'ve"", 'said', 'am', 'truly', 'genuinely', 'stunned', 'achievements', 'WWE', 'Studios', 'Once', 'time', 'laughable', 'arm', 'McMahon', 'empire', 'become', 'serious', 'player', 'independent', 'film', 'industry', 'production', 'only', ""'re"", 'moving', 'up', 'away', 'ridiculous', 'roots', 'something', 'very', 'tangible', 'see', 'taking', 'same', 'path', 'Lionsgate', 'Films.Quite', 'accomplishment', 'involved.Solid', 'five', 'stars']",N/A
1590949,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B009AMAJPA,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[0, 0]","DEAD MAN DOWN is about Victor (Farrell) and Beatrice (Rapace). Victor's a high-ranking enforcer on Alphonse's crime syndicate, and Beatrice is a lonely Spanish lady who still nurses a grudge against the drunk driver that scarred her pretty face up in an auto accident. Both of them nurse revenge fantasies against those who did them wrong, and as the movie develops, those fantasies intertwine as they come close to being made real.The film is boldly and artfully shot, and edited with equally impressive skill. This helps make up for some slow pacing; the film could've been about twenty minutes shorter had it not been so aggressively introspective and even repetitive in some parts (let's just say there's a whole lotta mulling going on). The story's not bad at all as far as these kinds of revenge thrillers go, although it's not trying too hard to be terribly creative, either. The soundtrack and the film's patient reveal of certain secrets (the less you know about the plot going into the film, the better, although it seems like every single review keeps trying to give away vital information that viewers don't learn until something like forty minutes in) keeps the slow-moving plot from feeling too labored, as do a handful of very tightly wound action sequences.There are a few other problems beside the run-time and the unequal balance of drama and thriller (and the film's horrible title). Farrell doesn't seem to do much acting at all in the entire film, opting instead to keep a neutral look of dull surprise on his face for most of the movie. He's supposed to be a man of quietly brooding inner passion, but you'd think maybe once or twice we'd get a shot of him showing some other kind of emotion. Likewise, Beatrice's character is initially driven by rage over her mangled appearance (little kids constantly taunt her, calling her a monster), but the scars on her face are barely noticeable in some shots. If they really wanted her character to make sense, they should've really disfigured her more than they did. As it is, it's quite obvious they wanted viewers to still find her pretty (her scars do little more than highlight her cheekbones and jaw), which makes her part in the story seem pretty contrived at first.Get past those little hang-ups and be prepared to deal with a handful of stretches where characters engage in silent, soulful reflection, and you should have a good time with this bang-em-up.",4,A Dish Best Served Lukewarm,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,2428,"['DEAD', 'MAN', 'DOWN', 'Victor', 'Farrell', 'Beatrice', 'Rapace', 'Victor', 'high-ranking', 'enforcer', 'Alphonse', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'Beatrice', 'lonely', 'Spanish', 'lady', 'who', 'still', 'grudge', 'drunk', 'driver', 'scarred', 'pretty', 'face', 'up', 'auto', 'accident', 'nurse', 'revenge', 'fantasies', 'who', 'did', 'wrong', 'movie', 'fantasies', 'intertwine', 'come', 'close', 'being', 'made', 'real.The', 'film', 'boldly', 'artfully', 'shot', 'edited', 'equally', 'impressive', 'skill', 'make', 'up', 'slow', 'pacing', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'aggressively', 'introspective', 'even', 'repetitive', 'parts', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'whole', 'lotta', 'mulling', 'going', 'story', 'not', 'bad', 'as', 'far', 'kinds', 'revenge', 'thrillers', 'go', 'not', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'terribly', 'creative', 'either', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'patient', 'reveal', 'certain', 'secrets', 'less', 'know', 'plot', 'going', 'film', 'better', 'single', 'review', 'trying', 'give', 'away', 'vital', 'information', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'something', 'forty', 'minutes', 'slow-moving', 'plot', 'feeling', 'too', 'labored', 'do', 'handful', 'very', 'tightly', 'wound', 'action', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'problems', 'run-time', 'unequal', 'balance', 'drama', 'thriller', 'film', 'horrible', 'title', 'Farrell', ""n't"", 'seem', 'do', 'much', 'acting', 'entire', 'film', 'opting', 'instead', 'keep', 'neutral', 'look', 'dull', 'surprise', 'face', 'most', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'man', 'quietly', 'brooding', 'inner', 'passion', ""'d"", 'think', 'maybe', 'once', 'twice', ""'d"", 'get', 'shot', 'showing', 'other', 'kind', 'emotion', 'Likewise', 'Beatrice', 'character', 'initially', 'driven', 'rage', 'mangled', 'appearance', 'little', 'kids', 'constantly', 'taunt', 'calling', 'monster', 'scars', 'face', 'are', 'barely', 'noticeable', 'shots', 'really', 'wanted', 'character', 'make', 'sense', 'should', ""'ve"", 'really', 'disfigured', 'more', 'did', 'quite', 'obvious', 'wanted', 'viewers', 'still', 'find', 'pretty', 'scars', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'highlight', 'cheekbones', 'jaw', 'part', 'story', 'seem', 'pretty', 'contrived', 'first.Get', 'little', 'hang-ups', 'be', 'prepared', 'deal', 'handful', 'stretches', 'where', 'characters', 'engage', 'silent', 'soulful', 'reflection', 'should', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'bang-em-up']",N/A
1590950,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B009AMAJPA,Mark Turner,"[1, 2]","I wrote recently about the slow burn. What I'm talking about is a movie where the pieces are readily available to you to figure out what exactly is going on. This doesn't mean these pieces are doled out in a haphazard order but that they are given to you one at a time, letting the story unfold rather than thrown at you in one big shove. Classic films were all about the slow burn but lately it seems that the MTV generation can't stand taking the time to hear a story out. They want it slam bam in your face right now! In viewing movies that way they miss so much.DEAD MAN DOWN is a slow burn film. It does offer plenty of action eventually but the story is the important thing here. Colin Farrell stars as Victor, a low level gang member who's on his way up in the world. Victor works for Alphonse (Terence Howard), a high level suit and tie thug who uses his gang to get property rather than the usual criminal endeavors. Someone has been sending Alphonse clipped squares from a photo along with snippets of sentences. This same person is seeking revenge against him but he has no clue who or why.When a member of Alphonse' gang is found in the basement freezer of his home it delivers another message to him. Not only the clues this time but the fact that the person sending them can get to him any time and anywhere. Alphonse thinks he knows who is behind it and he and his gang face down against a Jamaican crew that gives him a cut of their profits. Things go wrong and a shootout begins during which Victor saves Alphonse' life thus earning him more respect from his boss.The story involves a secondary plot as well. Victor lives in a high rise and across the way from his apartment lives Beatrice (Noomi Rapace). Beatrice is an attractive woman with a problem: the left side of her face is terribly scarred. She eventually approaches Victor in what seems like a date until she tells him the truth. She watched from across the way as he murdered the man recently found in Alphonse' freezer. She tells him she won't go to the police if he will do her one favor: kill the man who scarred her. It seems that the man was drunk when his car plowed into hers and did nothing more than 3 months in jail. Now she wants revenge.What we have are two separate cases of revenge here. Victor's due to a tragedy he suffered because of Alphonse and Beatrice's from the drunk driver. Victor agrees to help her but lets her know his problem comes first. The two eventually help one another and begin to develop a bond that goes beyond a simple business arrangement. And as that bond develops perhaps the days where life is nothing more than existing to seek revenge might change to a reason worth living.Farrell has turned in some really good performances lately (see SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS) but it doesn't appear that they are done in movies that are extreme money makers. But that doesn't stop him from doing the best he can which is quite good. Rapace is making a name for herself in English language films and shows what a solid actress she is here. Both are extremely compelling in their roles here, making you care about two people scarred, both inside and out, that are just trying to find their place in life again.As I said from the start, the clues meted out in this film are offered slowly but at a steady pace making the movie both interesting and well thought out. Don't go in expecting guns ablaze from start to finish but rather a movie that will make you think and solve the puzzles left for one and all to see.

1590955,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B009AMAJPA,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","I had high hopes for this purported action/thriller that reunites Noomi Rapace with her director from the original ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" Niels Arden Oplev. That was one of my favorite films from 2009. Unfortunately the movie gets a bit stuck with a lack of cohesive dialog and with a convoluted shoot out ending that seems to contradict the feel of the movie up to that point.I had the sense that Oplev was trying to emulate the tone set by fellow Dane, Nicolas Winding Refn with his 2011 Move ""Drive,"" another movie I love. Here, Victor (Colin Farrell) is an immigrant from Hungary whose wife and young daughter were killed by Albanians hired by the local crime boss (Terrence Howard) on behalf of kingpin (Armand Assante). The reason? They wouldn't move out of an apartment building needed for ""renovation."" Everyone thought Victor was killed as well, but he wasn't and he has vowed revenge. Evidently no one knew what he looked like.So Victor has infiltrated the crime inner sanctum operating as one of the gun toting soldiers. He is slowly eliminating those responsible and has a big plan in place that would take those remaining in one fell swoop.Victor lives in a high rise whose balcony faces the balcony of a twin building many feet away. That apartment is occupied by Beatrice (Rapace) and her French mother, Valentine (Isabelle Huppert, ""Amour""). Beatrice has been disfigured as the result of a car accident caused by a drunk driver. The driver got off with a light sentence and she's incensed to the point she wants him dead. Having seen Victor kill some dude in his apartment, she blackmails him into killing the drunk driver. Huh?Anyway, Beatrice and Victor make goo-goo eyes for most of the film but never take it anywhere. Again, I'm thinking about ""Drive."" In addition to this dumb premise there are others. Neighborhood kids tease Beatrice, calling her a monster and throwing rocks at her. Huh? While she still has a few scars, she ain't that hideous, boys. The acting is fine. But the actors need something to work with and that is the problem. For an action-thriller, the movie is a bit short of both.The Blu ray version of this film comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The film is flush with night time scenes both inside and in low light inside situations.  This seems to effect the visuals.  At times, distinction between shadings is a bit problematic.  I'm not saying this is unwatchable, but occasionally noticeable.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is excellent, bordering on demo grade.  Several scenes inside club get the surrounds hopping, and of course the final shoot-out puts the viewer in the middle of it all.  Excellent .1 feeds to the subs enhances the sound as well.  Extras include 3 short documentaries about the making of the movie, to go along with some Sony trailers.  Subtitles are in Spanish and English SDH as well as English for some foreign language bits and pieces (Albanian/Hungarian).",3,(BLU RAY REVIEW) for an action-thriller a bit short of both,1377648000,"08 28, 2013",2013,2972,"['had', 'high', 'hopes', 'purported', 'action/thriller', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'director', 'original', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'Niels', 'Arden', 'Oplev', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', '2009', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'bit', 'stuck', 'lack', 'cohesive', 'dialog', 'convoluted', 'shoot', 'ending', 'contradict', 'feel', 'movie', 'up', 'point.I', 'had', 'sense', 'Oplev', 'was', 'trying', 'emulate', 'tone', 'set', 'fellow', 'Dane', 'Nicolas', 'Winding', 'Refn', '2011', 'Move', 'Drive', 'movie', 'love', 'Here', 'Victor', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'immigrant', 'Hungary', 'wife', 'young', 'daughter', 'were', 'killed', 'Albanians', 'hired', 'local', 'crime', 'boss', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'behalf', 'kingpin', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'reason', 'would', ""n't"", 'move', 'out', 'apartment', 'building', 'needed', 'renovation', 'Everyone', 'thought', 'Victor', 'was', 'killed', 'as', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'vowed', 'revenge', 'Evidently', 'one', 'knew', 'what', 'looked', 'like.So', 'Victor', 'infiltrated', 'crime', 'inner', 'sanctum', 'operating', 'one', 'gun', 'toting', 'soldiers', 'slowly', 'eliminating', 'responsible', 'big', 'plan', 'place', 'would', 'take', 'remaining', 'one', 'fell', 'swoop.Victor', 'lives', 'high', 'rise', 'balcony', 'balcony', 'twin', 'building', 'many', 'feet', 'away', 'apartment', 'occupied', 'Beatrice', 'Rapace', 'French', 'mother', 'Valentine', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'Amour', 'Beatrice', 'been', 'disfigured', 'result', 'car', 'accident', 'caused', 'drunk', 'driver', 'driver', 'got', 'off', 'light', 'sentence', 'incensed', 'point', 'dead', 'Having', 'seen', 'Victor', 'kill', 'dude', 'apartment', 'killing', 'drunk', 'driver', 'Huh', 'Anyway', 'Beatrice', 'Victor', 'make', 'goo-goo', 'eyes', 'most', 'film', 'never', 'take', 'anywhere', 'Again', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'Drive', 'addition', 'dumb', 'premise', 'are', 'others', 'Neighborhood', 'kids', 'tease', 'Beatrice', 'calling', 'monster', 'throwing', 'rocks', 'Huh', 'still', 'few', 'scars', 'ai', ""n't"", 'that', 'hideous', 'boys', 'acting', 'fine', 'actors', 'need', 'something', 'work', 'problem', 'action-thriller', 'movie', 'bit', 'short', 'both.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'version', 'film', '1080p', 'video', 'resolution', '2.40:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'film', 'flush', 'night', 'time', 'scenes', 'inside', 'low', 'light', 'situations', 'effect', 'visuals', 'times', 'distinction', 'shadings', 'bit', 'problematic', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'unwatchable', 'occasionally', 'noticeable', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'track', 'excellent', 'bordering', 'demo', 'grade', 'Several', 'scenes', 'club', 'get', 'surrounds', 'hopping', 'course', 'final', 'shoot-out', 'viewer', 'middle', 'Excellent', '.1', 'subs', 'sound', 'as', 'well', 'Extras', 'include', '3', 'short', 'documentaries', 'making', 'movie', 'go', 'along', 'Sony', 'trailers', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'Spanish', 'English', 'SDH', 'as', 'well', 'English', 'foreign', 'language', 'bits', 'pieces', 'Albanian/Hungarian']",N/A

I guess first would be SPOILER ALERT:*They make a big deal over this pretty girl's scars on her otherwise very pretty face.  No deformity at all.  What's the big deal?  She has a few scars and wants a guy that caused it dead now?  Silly.  Would have been much better had he given them to her via domestic violence.*And like kids are going to harass her because of those scars.  Stupid.*Victor is able to work for the bad guy he hates for I think a year.  Gee, I wonder how many bad things he did to good people in that year.  Again, silly.*What's the deal with Alphonso finding the bug in his phone and then arranging to ambush his stalker but supposedly only telling one of his henchmen?  I mean later Victor gets a text to come to the meeting with all the other henchmen.  So who is Alphonso hoping to snare?  And then he sits with Victor and tells him pretty much that I know it is you, maybe you.  Then they cutaway to a different scene.  So what was the point of all that?*Then the girl decides that she isn't going to send the FedEx?  Really?  Because in all her worldly knowledge she thought that would be best to sabotage Victor's plan thus leaving him a sitting duck basically.  But wait, she's in love now with him, a guy she blackmailed into murder that she doesn't even know.*Then instead she sends the rabbits foot.  Remember that she gave that rabbits foot to Victor for a while.  Perhaps the bad guys have already seen that rabbits foot in Victor's hands.  Probably not a good idea.*What's with Victor's partner breaking in the door of Victor's apt?  He said he was worried about Victor?  Hmm, but why and why now?  It's not like Victor was getting close to solving the mystery of the stalker.*Oh and of course his partner easily finds Victor's planning room.  The same planning room Victor so openly showed the chick...who was blackmailing him.Seriously, I could go on and on.  The movie was so full of holes that I have to believe it got destroyed in editing.  The ""9PM meeting/ambush"" scene should have come much later in the movie.

1590963,A2D5FK0NKOFWNJ,B009AMAJPA,"Orson Welles ""Hollywood""","[1, 2]","I think the people who gave Dead Man Down negative reviews are much closer to the mark than those who rate it highly.  The dialogue is banal, starting with the opening line. It doesn't get better.  The plot is improbable, derivative, and highly predictable. The last 30 minutes move at a snail's pace as we watch characters in the film figure out for themselves--in a series of ""duh!"" moments"" what we knew 20-40 minutes ago.  Why watch the film, then?  For the acting and the cinematography.  Colin Farrell and Roomi Mara actually do a lot of very good work with a pretty empty script.  And here's another reason: Isabelle Huppert is in the film--who knows why.  Terence Stamp also delivers an amazing performance.  The film is highly watchable. The shots are original and the pacing excellent for the first 90 minutes.  My guess is that this was originally a great film until someone demanded it be dumbed down and seriously slowed down near the end so Dead Man Down  could compete with such wonders of cinema as The Hit Man or The Punisher.

This is a must see movie with two actors alone Colin Farrell who plays Victor the man out for Revenge and Noomi Rapace, as Beatrice the woman using Victor for the Revenge she wants against her drunk driver, who left her left side of her face disfigured when he hit her with his car.  The disfigurement was bad enough, but the children in the neighborhood, who harass this woman by calling her monster and throwing stones, etc. at her, as well as writing MONSTER on her apartment door.  They both were actors made for this movie, because of the acting they have done previously Colin Farrell with many Irish Films and Noomi Rapace as the ""Girl with Tattoos"" movies really played the role the two of them to perfection.  Direction by Niels Arden Opley was excellent capturing the right shots at the right time to add to the suspense the two were living through, writer credits (WGA) and was written by J.H. Wyman.The following actors with main roles are as follows Terrence Howard plays Alphonse one of the big bosses responsible for many killings past and present.  Along with Dominic Cooper playing Darcy a thug, Isablelle Huppert plays Beatrice's mother Valentine Louzon, Luis Da Silva Jr. plays another thug Terry, and Stu Bennett also playing another thug for one of the gangs was known, as Kilroy.Well known actor of many Gangster movies Armand Assante makes an appearance, as Lon Gordon a head mobster of the clientele bosses.This movie sure can be watched over again, as the story and acting is mesmerizing for any audience to know that revenge is truly bitter sweet for most of us in the end.Below is the link for a great Friday or Saturday night movie for adults, make up the popcorn and sit back and truly enjoy a wonderful action packed movie with great actors and very well written and directed.Enjoy my Friends:B00DHNJCKQ",5,Dead Man Down -Wow is the Right word for this Film,1378080000,"09 2, 2013",2013,1943,"['Dead', 'Man', 'Down', 'Five', 'Star', 'Movie', 'Story', 'Acting', 'Plot', 'Revenge', 'can', 'be', 'Bitter', 'Sweet', 'must', 'see', 'movie', 'two', 'actors', 'alone', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'who', 'Victor', 'man', 'out', 'Revenge', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'Beatrice', 'woman', 'using', 'Victor', 'Revenge', 'drunk', 'driver', 'who', 'left', 'left', 'side', 'face', 'disfigured', 'when', 'hit', 'car', 'disfigurement', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'children', 'neighborhood', 'who', 'harass', 'woman', 'calling', 'monster', 'throwing', 'stones', 'etc', 'as', 'well', 'writing', 'MONSTER', 'apartment', 'door', 'were', 'actors', 'made', 'movie', 'acting', 'have', 'done', 'previously', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'many', 'Irish', 'Films', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'Girl', 'Tattoos', 'movies', 'really', 'played', 'role', 'two', 'perfection', 'Direction', 'Niels', 'Arden', 'Opley', 'was', 'excellent', 'capturing', 'right', 'shots', 'right', 'time', 'add', 'suspense', 'two', 'were', 'living', 'writer', 'credits', 'WGA', 'was', 'written', 'J.H', 'Wyman.The', 'following', 'actors', 'main', 'roles', 'are', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Alphonse', 'one', 'big', 'bosses', 'responsible', 'many', 'killings', 'past', 'present', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'playing', 'Darcy', 'thug', 'Isablelle', 'Huppert', 'Beatrice', 'mother', 'Valentine', 'Louzon', 'Luis', 'Da', 'Silva', 'Jr.', 'thug', 'Terry', 'Stu', 'Bennett', 'also', 'playing', 'thug', 'one', 'gangs', 'was', 'known', 'Kilroy.Well', 'known', 'actor', 'many', 'Gangster', 'movies', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'appearance', 'Lon', 'Gordon', 'head', 'mobster', 'clientele', 'bosses.This', 'movie', 'sure', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'again', 'story', 'acting', 'mesmerizing', 'audience', 'know', 'revenge', 'truly', 'bitter', 'sweet', 'most', 'end.Below', 'link', 'great', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'night', 'movie', 'adults', 'make', 'up', 'popcorn', 'sit', 'back', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'wonderful', 'action', 'packed', 'movie', 'great', 'actors', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'directed.Enjoy', 'Friends', 'B00DHNJCKQ']",N/A

Noomi Rapace was not the best actress for this part, and her damaged face and clothing and situation just did not work. Her mother was a strange, odd addition to the mix. Colin Farrell was appropriately moody, and grungey; but his lack of articulation made the storyline hard to follow. Some of the set ups must have looked good in the design stage, like the two strangers waving from balconies in the same apartment complex; or the truck driving in to the house at the end,; or the warehouse wired with explosives; or the restaurant meeting next to the large plate glass window... but none of these elements worked well enough in the final movie.

Now Farrell has gone undercover to exact his revenge on the men responsible for destroying his life. Meanwhile, to further complicate matters, an attractive neighbor (Noomi Rapace), who's been disfigured in a car crash, enlists him to kill the man responsible for the accident.Though the plotting is not entirely plausible all the way through, the screenplay by J.

1590978,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B009AMAJPA,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[3, 4]","""Love can heal the most damaged heart"", Dead Man Down begins with a character saying these words, so it isn't too hard to guess that this will be the theme found within it. Which it is, and if the move had stayed with just that it would have been one of the best movies in a god long while, but it tragically unspools into an explicably silly action thriller by it's far too routine ending, however given the 85% or 90%  of the film that unfolds before it, I can with certainty say that Dead Man Down is quite a good film, one that threatens constantly to reach the level of greatness. However, it falls victim to current movie trends.Starring the always unswerving Colin Farrell as Victor, a small time mob enforcer harboring some potentially dangerous secrets and inner demons. He enters into a relationship with a neighbor named Beatrice (Noami Rapace) who also has a darkness of her own. Beatrice witnessed a killing carried out by Victor and even recorded it. Some time ago Beatrice was partially disfigured in a car wreck, know tormented by neighborhood kids who scrawl ""monster"" on her apartment door. Beatrice wants Victor to kill the man, who while drunk and driving, was responsible for the accident.This is the set up for a dark and fascinating neo-noir. In many ways Dead Man Down is a kin to the amazing Drive, a gutsy and fastidious attempt at telling an existential drama that is closer in tone and style to the classics of the genre than we have been accustomed to in recent years.Dead Man Down marks the first English language film from Niels Arden Opley, the Swedish director behiend the original Swedish language the Girl with the Dragoon Tattoo. Here he's reteamed with his lovely and exciting leading lady Rapace. Opley shows a great visual flair and is more than capable of telling a good or better story in the always fascinating world of noir.Working from a solid, but unexceptional script by J.H. Wyman. Dead Man Down comes with the promise of being a standard all-too familiar revenge sage, but for the most part it is so much more than that. A complicated character driven love story set to a backdrop of appropriate doom and gloom, it only surrenders to it's marketing campaign with a highly improbable guns-a-blazing ending.A lot of the credit rests on the shoulders of the movie's fine cast. Farrell and Rapace sell there characters to us so convincingly that we fail to question some the more obvious absurdities in it. The two talented and charismatic leads oodles with chemistry and Dead Man Down really comes to it's dark and convincing life when these two are on screen.Also very good is the underappreciated actor Dominic Cooper, who if more people had seen his excellent work in the Devil`s Double, I am convinced he would be a major star now and a leading man. Terence Howard also manages to be quite good, despite playing a rather one dimensional cartoonish villain. Adding to the cast are some nice familiar faces that we haven't seen criminally in a long awhile, Isabelle Huppert, F. Murray Abraham and Armand Assante.Some nice technical work is on clear display as well, Dead Man Down is nicely photographed by stylish action cinematographer Paul Cameron. The action scenes are agreeably edited by the duo of Timothy A. Good and Frederic Thoraval. An interesting looking production designed from Niels Sejer helps establish the noir atmosphere.All was in place for Dead Man Down to be one of the best movies of the year and a glorious American debut for the newly arrived director Opley, sadly it just wasn't meant to be and is never allowed to jell. Dead Man Down begins to crumple in it's last fifteen or twenty minutes as it becomes ever more ludicrously contrived and ends in a preposterous showdown that looks like it was ripped from a completely different and less imaginative movie.The over the top action conclusion should not have come as much of a surprise given that the film is brought us by the good people at WWE films, the movie branch of the world wrestling  entertainment.. It just seems so disappointing that it does, and because so much of the movie was just on the verge of excellent that it's unsatisfactory conclusion catches us off guard. It is also plainly unnecessary.I was willing to give WWE films the benefit of the doubt that they could be able to make a smart and complicated thriller without resorting to the lower standards they are famous for. However, this absurd and forced finale seems as though it would be more at home in one of their direct-to-DVD sequels to the Marine.Dead Man Down ultimately will leave any self respecting viewer unhappy and discouraged, maybe even angry, with just how close it came to being something truly special. A real tragic missed opportunity, but taking into account all the good that is here, this is still a first class entertainment and a worthy entry in the cannon of contemporary crime thrillers",4,a
