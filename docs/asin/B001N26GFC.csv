Sally Hawkins portrayal is noteworthy but the character is slap-worthy until the very end rather than lovable. The movie ends a minute too long - had it ended a few frames before it does, it would've made a posh statement, a statement that resembles the rest of the movie, instead of falling into the romantic comedy trap of our times.",2,sappy rather than happy; slow-going rather than easy going; annoying rather than charming,1229990400,"12 23, 2008",2008,533,"['Riding', 'off', 'very', 'slow', 'start', 'movie', 'patters', 'most', 'part', 'last', 'quarter', 'film', 'when', 'up', 'pace', 'dynamic', 'characters', 'really', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'portrayal', 'noteworthy', 'character', 'slap-worthy', 'very', 'end', 'rather', 'lovable', 'movie', 'minute', 'too', 'long', 'had', 'ended', 'few', 'frames', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'posh', 'statement', 'statement', 'rest', 'movie', 'instead', 'falling', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'trap', 'times']",Happy-Go-Lucky
1218661,AIPSUF99BQ17T,B001N26GFC,Amazon.com-lover,"[1, 1]","Yes, another in a long line of movies about quirky women who dress wacky, but ...but! This movie is completely worth seeing for Sally Hawkins, her semi androgynous beauty, her expressive face and body... it is worth it alone to see the scene when she goes to a flamenco dancing lesson...when she realizes she left her sunglasses perched on her head.. I can not give it away, it showed Sally's gift at physical comedy. I loved the special feature that explained the making of the movie, the intricacies involved with shooting in the car,the interviews with the actors and actresses... the featurette gave so much good information it made me understand the movie more, and THEN I actually sat and watched the whole movie again with the sparkling and completely engrossing commentary by director Mike Leigh! I highly recommend the movie, the extras, and especially the commentary.I gave it 4 instead of 5 because I could not understand chunks of dialogue because of the strong accents/jargon.. but I do love the accents and jargon ... there was a wee bit too much with the driving instructor, he was SUCH an unlikable character, I could not find the part of his character that would make me care about him, ( altho the actor who played him was excellent especially if you watch him being interviewed and he is nothing like that creepy weirdo) ...and also because of the scene when the driving instructor pulled Poppy;s hair and yet she  still treated him oh so kindly after he assaulted her, that was the only annoying unbelievable thing to me.. Later when I heard the commentary Mike Leigh explained what he was trying to convey mixing Poppy and the driving instructor.. they were the opposites in life.The other actresses who played Poppy's sisters and friends and co workers were wonderful and added a richness and sweetness to the whole mix. The actor who played Poppy's boyfriend was so charming and believeable, but as we learn later in the featurette, the actor is a Shakespearean actor... Oh those amazing British actors and actresses with their extensive and amazing theatrical educations! It shows! They all make it seem effortless and natural.The flamenco instructor was an actress who really stood out, too, what an amazing and scene stealing wonderful actress!I hope you enjoy this movie, it really was, on a whole, delightful and uplifting and lovely!PS- some other reviewers felt Poppy was not truly happy, or was irresponsible, or was evil. Their view points were very interesting to me, but I did not think so. There is a scene where she tells her sister how she feels about her life and I felt that Poppy was sincere in her happiness, that she truly had a gift about seeing the best in people or situations, maybe to a fault tho. But arent all characters flawed or confused or a mix of good hearted with a streak of something else? Which would explain her acting out with the driving instructor. At 30, which seems to be not that old these days, she was a woman still growing into her own.",4,"Really enjoyable, Sally Hawkins is adorable",1244073600,"06 4, 2009",2009,3004,"['Yes', 'long', 'line', 'movies', 'quirky', 'women', 'who', 'dress', 'wacky', 'movie', 'completely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'semi', 'androgynous', 'beauty', 'expressive', 'face', 'body', 'alone', 'see', 'scene', 'when', 'flamenco', 'dancing', 'lesson', 'when', 'left', 'sunglasses', 'perched', 'head..', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'showed', 'Sally', 'gift', 'physical', 'comedy', 'loved', 'special', 'feature', 'explained', 'making', 'movie', 'intricacies', 'involved', 'shooting', 'car', 'interviews', 'actors', 'actresses', 'featurette', 'gave', 'so', 'much', 'good', 'information', 'made', 'understand', 'movie', 'more', 'THEN', 'actually', 'sat', 'watched', 'whole', 'movie', 'again', 'sparkling', 'completely', 'engrossing', 'commentary', 'director', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'extras', 'especially', 'commentary.I', 'gave', '4', 'instead', '5', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'chunks', 'dialogue', 'strong', 'accents/jargon..', 'do', 'love', 'accents', 'jargon', 'was', 'wee', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'driving', 'instructor', 'was', 'SUCH', 'unlikable', 'character', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'part', 'character', 'would', 'make', 'care', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'was', 'excellent', 'especially', 'watch', 'being', 'interviewed', 'nothing', 'creepy', 'weirdo', 'also', 'scene', 'when', 'driving', 'instructor', 'pulled', 'Poppy', 'hair', 'yet', 'still', 'treated', 'oh', 'so', 'kindly', 'assaulted', 'was', 'only', 'annoying', 'unbelievable', 'thing', 'me..', 'Later', 'when', 'heard', 'commentary', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'explained', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'convey', 'mixing', 'Poppy', 'driving', 'instructor..', 'were', 'opposites', 'life.The', 'other', 'actresses', 'who', 'played', 'Poppy', 'sisters', 'friends', 'co', 'workers', 'were', 'wonderful', 'added', 'richness', 'sweetness', 'whole', 'mix', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Poppy', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'so', 'charming', 'believeable', 'learn', 'later', 'featurette', 'actor', 'Shakespearean', 'actor', 'Oh', 'amazing', 'British', 'actors', 'actresses', 'extensive', 'amazing', 'theatrical', 'educations', 'make', 'seem', 'effortless', 'natural.The', 'flamenco', 'instructor', 'was', 'actress', 'who', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'too', 'what', 'amazing', 'scene', 'stealing', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'really', 'was', 'whole', 'delightful', 'uplifting', 'lovely', 'PS-', 'other', 'reviewers', 'felt', 'Poppy', 'was', 'not', 'truly', 'happy', 'was', 'irresponsible', 'was', 'evil', 'view', 'points', 'were', 'very', 'interesting', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'so', 'scene', 'where', 'sister', 'how', 'life', 'felt', 'Poppy', 'was', 'sincere', 'happiness', 'truly', 'had', 'gift', 'seeing', 'best', 'people', 'situations', 'maybe', 'fault', 'tho', 'arent', 'characters', 'flawed', 'confused', 'mix', 'good', 'hearted', 'streak', 'something', 'else', 'Which', 'would', 'explain', 'acting', 'out', 'driving', 'instructor', '30', 'be', 'not', 'old', 'days', 'was', 'woman', 'still', 'growing', 'own']",Happy-Go-Lucky
1218662,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001N26GFC,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","I've never heard so much gripping and moaning as I did the day the Oscar nominations were announced and Sally Hawkins was snubbed the Best Actress nomination.  She had been labeled the front runner even though everyone and their mother knew that no one outside of Streep had a remote chance of stealing Winslet's much deserved Oscar away, but still, Hawkins stamp in the awards race was too large to ignore.  She swept the precursors, winning almost every actress award imaginable and so when she was denied even a nomination come Oscar morning it was not only odd, it was shameful.Even though I would have still handed the Oscar to Winslet, the fact that Hawkins was snubbed rubs me wrong as well.After having watched this delightful little film a few times now I can honestly say, that while the film may not be as deep or even as eventful as I would have hoped, it is far from the shallow farce many have labeled it.  I understand that Hawkins' performance will not be deemed a masterpiece by all, and those who label her nothing more than annoying and aggravating are not entirely wrong in their conclusion and thus I cannot fault them.  Her performance is not for everyone, but one has to be able to look at the achievement apart from the character and realize that she single handedly CREATED this character from the ground up; and despite all of Poppy's manic mannerisms and her annoyingly delightful demeanor there is a sadness that lurks in the quiet moments (that scene with the bum just wrecked me) and Hawkins marvelously unveils that for us.The film seems to be void of any real plot.  Poppy is an eccentric school teacher (I really wish I were in her class) who decides it's about time she learns to drive.  She takes lessons every Saturday from Scott, an angry and controlling man who may or may not have a thing for Poppy despite his apparent annoyance with her cheeriness.  That's really it.  There is a side plot involving an unruly student and a counselor who happens to strike Poppy's fancy, but aside from that the main focus of the film is Poppy's driving lessons.  It's within these lessons that we get to the heart of Leigh's script, that interaction between someone incessantly optimistic and someone who is a stark contrast; direly pessimistic.I wish that the rest of the cast, namely Eddie Marsan, could have stood up to Hawkins brilliance but sadly she is the only shining light here.  Marsan couldn't embrace his character the way I wanted him to and he just came off as rather caricaturist and hammy.  This is a true testament to Hawkins' talent, for her character had all the makings of a caricature but instead she reigns it all in to create someone truly three dimensional and pure.I would have liked to have seen a little more out of the script, which could have easily embellished on the root of Poppy's spirit with a little more intelligence.  It leaves gateways for the audience to understand her, but in the end it only satisfies our curiosity minimally in my personal opinion.  The final confrontation scene with Scott is very enlightening and it makes me wish that there had been a little more of that form of tension or confrontation in the film.  It is almost too chipper at times, thus taking away from the emotional heart of the story.In the end `Happy-go-Lucky' is very lucky that it has such a happy star, really, for Hawkins carries this film on her back and makes for one truly delightful experience.  It could have been better had it focused a little more on the core of Poppy herself, but as far as comedic fare goes, there are few that are this rewarding.",4,I'm pretty happy with the end result...,1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,3606,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'gripping', 'moaning', 'did', 'day', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'were', 'announced', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'was', 'snubbed', 'Best', 'Actress', 'nomination', 'had', 'been', 'labeled', 'front', 'runner', 'even', 'everyone', 'mother', 'knew', 'one', 'outside', 'Streep', 'had', 'remote', 'chance', 'stealing', 'Winslet', 'much', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'away', 'still', 'Hawkins', 'stamp', 'awards', 'race', 'was', 'too', 'large', 'ignore', 'swept', 'precursors', 'winning', 'almost', 'actress', 'award', 'imaginable', 'so', 'when', 'was', 'denied', 'even', 'nomination', 'come', 'Oscar', 'morning', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'odd', 'was', 'shameful.Even', 'would', 'have', 'still', 'handed', 'Oscar', 'Winslet', 'fact', 'Hawkins', 'was', 'snubbed', 'wrong', 'well.After', 'having', 'watched', 'delightful', 'little', 'film', 'few', 'times', 'now', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'deep', 'even', 'as', 'eventful', 'would', 'have', 'hoped', 'far', 'shallow', 'farce', 'many', 'have', 'labeled', 'understand', 'Hawkins', 'performance', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'deemed', 'masterpiece', 'who', 'label', 'nothing', 'more', 'annoying', 'aggravating', 'are', 'not', 'entirely', 'wrong', 'conclusion', 'thus', 'can', 'not', 'fault', 'performance', 'not', 'everyone', 'one', 'be', 'able', 'look', 'achievement', 'apart', 'character', 'realize', 'single', 'handedly', 'CREATED', 'character', 'ground', 'up', 'Poppy', 'manic', 'mannerisms', 'annoyingly', 'delightful', 'demeanor', 'sadness', 'quiet', 'moments', 'scene', 'bum', 'just', 'wrecked', 'Hawkins', 'marvelously', 'us.The', 'film', 'be', 'void', 'real', 'plot', 'Poppy', 'eccentric', 'school', 'teacher', 'really', 'wish', 'were', 'class', 'who', 'time', 'drive', 'lessons', 'Saturday', 'Scott', 'angry', 'controlling', 'man', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'thing', 'Poppy', 'apparent', 'annoyance', 'cheeriness', 'really', 'side', 'plot', 'involving', 'unruly', 'student', 'counselor', 'who', 'strike', 'Poppy', 'fancy', 'aside', 'main', 'focus', 'film', 'Poppy', 'driving', 'lessons', 'lessons', 'get', 'heart', 'Leigh', 'script', 'interaction', 'someone', 'incessantly', 'optimistic', 'someone', 'who', 'stark', 'contrast', 'direly', 'pessimistic.I', 'wish', 'rest', 'cast', 'namely', 'Eddie', 'Marsan', 'could', 'have', 'stood', 'up', 'Hawkins', 'brilliance', 'sadly', 'only', 'shining', 'light', 'here', 'Marsan', 'could', ""n't"", 'embrace', 'character', 'way', 'wanted', 'just', 'came', 'off', 'rather', 'caricaturist', 'hammy', 'true', 'testament', 'Hawkins', 'talent', 'character', 'had', 'makings', 'caricature', 'instead', 'create', 'someone', 'truly', 'three', 'dimensional', 'pure.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'little', 'more', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'embellished', 'root', 'Poppy', 'spirit', 'little', 'more', 'intelligence', 'gateways', 'audience', 'understand', 'end', 'only', 'curiosity', 'minimally', 'personal', 'opinion', 'final', 'confrontation', 'scene', 'Scott', 'very', 'enlightening', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'form', 'tension', 'confrontation', 'film', 'almost', 'too', 'chipper', 'times', 'thus', 'taking', 'away', 'emotional', 'heart', 'story.In', 'end', 'Happy-go-Lucky', 'very', 'lucky', 'happy', 'star', 'really', 'Hawkins', 'film', 'back', 'one', 'truly', 'delightful', 'experience', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'focused', 'little', 'more', 'core', 'Poppy', 'as', 'far', 'comedic', 'fare', 'are', 'few', 'are', 'rewarding']",Happy-Go-Lucky
1218663,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B001N26GFC,Andy Orrock,"[0, 1]","As noted in other reviews here, one's liking of 'Happy-Go-Lucky,' Mike Leigh's latest improvisational gem, depends almost solely on your acceptance of Sally Hawkins' relentlessly optimistic, chatterbox character, Poppy.  Personally, I found her unstintingly charming and endearing, just a real treat on the screen.  [And if you question whether that's acting or just her up there, check out Ms. Hawkins' turn as 'Slasher' inLayer Cake (Widescreen).]  I was equally taken with Poppy's flatmate, Zoe, winningly played by Lexi Zegerman.  She won the British Independent Film Award for Best Supporting Actress for this portrayal.  Rightfully so: her scenes - almost all with Poppy - help Hawkins flesh out the nature of her character.  Ms. Zegerman is a supporting actress in the best sense of the word.You can't talk about this movie without mentioning Eddie Marsan, flat-out brilliant as Scott the driving instructor, and the polar opposite of Poppy's unending reservoirs of cheerfulness.  It's the scenes of Poppy and Scott together in the car that form the core of the movie.  Poppy bubbling and chattering and joking, Scott seething and resenting and, finally, breaking.  And, when he does break, an astounding rush of pent-up, repressed thoughts come tumbling forth.  If you've seen Leigh'sVera Drake, you will remember Marsan as the shy, low-key suitor of Drake's daughter.  Same guy!  Now, that's acting.And, d-mn you, Eddie, I've been repeating 'en-ra-ha!' to myself all day!  As his character Scott states, ""You will remember 'en-ra-ha'.""

DeRiemer,"[0, 1]","It's probably because unrestrained optimism can be as tiring as climbing six flights of stairs carrying a sack of groceries, but Poppy, as much as I admired her outlook, wore me out. We spend several days with this 30-year-old young woman who lives and works in blue collar North London. She shares a flat with her best friend, teaches at an elementary school, bikes around town, takes driving lessons, has her spine jerked into shape, signs up for flamenco, encounters a down-and-outer, helps a student who is angry for reasons we don't know, maybe finds a boyfriend, has her bike stolen, tries to make a bookseller smile, and sums up in a rowboat her approach to living.By now you've guessed that Happy-Go-Lucky is Poppy's story, the story of a woman who chooses indomitably to be cheerful, to try to make others cheerful and to refuse to let life's downbeats dictate her own music. The movie is improbable, irritating and often quite touching.Sally Hawkins plays Poppy. It must have been an incredibly draining job. Poppy is a woman who laughs, cracks jokes, mugs, does a dance step or two or all of the above whenever she's happy, sad, in pain, feels awkward with others or is just by herself. She doesn't stop. Yet with all this obsessive cheerfulness (although it's not really obsessive because Poppy makes her own choices of how she wants to be and what makes her happy), we also realize that somewhere in the incessant behavior is an empathetic woman, deeper than we might have thought. When she deals with her angry student, she really listens to the child and slowly draws him out. Her experiences with an over-the-top driving instructor, a man full of resentments and pride, eventually leave her on a sidewalk with him driving off. But in the face of his possibly dangerous anger, she actually wants to help the guy. She reaches out carefully but sincerely. As loony an experience as her night-time encounter with a chanting tramp is, she's more concerned with the man than she is scared enough to run away. And, who knows, perhaps she finds the love of her life in Tim, the social services counselor brought in to work with the troubled boy. We really hope so. With all these vignettes, Sally Hawkins probably has given the performance of her career.But to be truthful, I got tired of Poppy well before the movie was over. I hope that things will turn out well for her, but life has a way of springing some nasty surprises no matter how nice a person you might be. I liked Poppy, but she'd probably drive me crazy as a neighbor.The writer and director, Mike Leigh, is one of those rare movie birds, a man who makes his own movies on his terms. He doesn't operate from a script, but works closely with the actors in plotting out where they will go when the cameras start. Any director has my vote who can come up with such disparate and excellent movies asVera Drake(2004) andTopsy-Turvy(1999). Vera Drake, with a powerful, anguished performance by Imelda Staunton, deals with abortion in England when it was a crime. Topsy-Turvy is the delightful story of how Gilbert and Sullivan, close to loathing each other at times, came to create The Mikado. Jim Broadbent as Gilbert and Allan Corduner as Sullivan have seldom been better.

1218670,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001N26GFC,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[5, 6]","No this is not deep cinema, no it's not an action film, no it's not a jiggle film, no...it's not a lot of things. What Happy Go Lucky is, a wonderful small film that just makes a person feel good. It stands proudly and says, there is good in people everywhere, it just depends on how you look at them. And this film just made this reviewer feel good at the end.The flim opens with credits rolling and Poppy, the central character of the film, riding her bicycle around a city in England. The director chose to use an older 60's / 70's technique of moving a rectangular box around the screen and placing the credits in the black space.Poppy parks her bicycle on the street, goes inside a book store. At this moment it is clear, Poppy looks at life differently from most people. It is driven home when she walks out of the store to find her bicycle stolen. She stands for a few seconds, and she says, ""oh shoot, I didn't even get to say goodbye to you."" Obviously, Poppy's view of the world is different, and maybe very healthy.The fear of this moment in the film, where a character reacts in a quirky happy manner, is that they will be a Pollyanna, or they are insane. Mike Leigh, the director and writer, toed a very difficult line in making Poppy at once loveable and happy, but not overboard. Poppy doesn't walk around smiling vapidly everywhere. She gets genuinuely upset at certain things, cares deeply about what happnes around her, but then can smile at the good that comes out of an unfortunate event. Poppy remains somebody that everyone would love to have around.Frankly, describing more of the story would simply harm the lovely discovery of this film. Getting to know Poppy, Zoey, Poppy's two sisters, Scot the driving instructor, the Flaminco dance instructor... all the characters, is the best part of this film.Remember, this is a small film. It probably had a very low budget, filmed on the inexpensive side of movies. It is not a GREAT film. There are some pacing issues here and there. Shots aren't always in perfect focus. But where production and film style matter, Mike Leigh brings it on. The shots in the car, a virtually impossible place to shoot film, are remarkable. The close ups as each actor speaks are for film school study. The music is a bit over the top most of the time. The strings and orchestra overemphasize some parts of the film. However, the sound in the very last scene is incredible, and there music is used to perfection.If you want a film that will make you happy, will make you feel good when it is over - Happy Go Lucky is perfection.The film is could have been PG, it is just oh so close (darn MPAA). But one of the most important scenes near the end of the the film, there is some very strong language that lasts for not even 30 seconds. There is an incredibly sensuous scene, but with absolutely no nudity. Frankly, that scene has to be one of the best romantic scenes the reviewer has seen in a very long time. There is absolutely no violence of any kind. Honestly, if it weren't for those inane MPAA rules about the F bomb (more than two), this film would be PG-13.The DVD is presented with a few previews and no bonus features.

Poppy(Sally Hawkins) is just naturally a happy person.  Her ebullience is not some defense mechanism or a mask for some inner depression.  Life isn't a complete bowl of cherries for Poppy but she copes through her lust for the better things life has to offer.  This film is not some cynical exercise rife with manipulation.  Director Mike Leigh keeps the film firmly grounded in reality.  It also helps to have a superb actress like Hawkins to project likability and make it believable.

1218672,A3KZQT3SZA07IL,B001N26GFC,Della,"[2, 3]","Poppy thinks of herself as quirky, fun and kind, but you can't really be kind to people if you never put yourself in their shoes and are only interested in demonstrating your own happy personality.She thinks she's being friendly to the bookstore employee but she never notices that he is trying to do some work on the computer and that she is constantly interrupting him. Poppy thinks she's the funny life of the party at her dance class but she's oblivious to the fact that she disrupts it by coming in late, making the teacher repeat everything and dressing so as to be the loud, off key note in the harmonious chorus.  As a teacher herself she should know better and at the very least she could have shown a bit of sympathy when the teacher has a slight break down.  Instead she ridicules her.She takes her obliviously obnoxious behavior to it's most extreme by forcing her presence on a schizophrenic man who is obviously in the midst of a psychotic hallucination.  She adds to his paranoia and fear and risks her own safety, all to no purpose.  If Poppy was as kind and compassionate as this scene wants us to believe she would have quietly called the police so that the man could be taken to the hospital and given the medication and care he so desperately needed.She's judgmental and superior toward her sister for the great sin of living a conventional lifestyle.She's intolerably rude and disrespectful to her driving instructor, cruelly pushing him to the edge of his already fragile sanity, and she's cavalier with the lives of others as she drives recklessly down the street while talking incessantly about herself.Poppy is thrilled with her own happy self but I'm glad I don't have to deal with her.

1218673,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001N26GFC,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 3]","Fun, bubbly and really enjoyable.  Sally Hawkins just owns this role!  A wonderful performance and a kind of movie that is just rare, wild and crazy fun!Director and writer Mike Leigh returns with ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" and with his cool and non-traditional approach in movie making, the film benefits from the talent just becoming as one with their character and the fact that the actors themselves didn't know what they were getting into, you get a unique style of film that may not have a major plot per se, but it's more of how one woman's attitude and behavior affects the people around her.The film is about Poppy (Sally Hawkins), her way of looking at life is rather bubbly, always happy, optimistic, cracking jokes with a tinge of perverted humor.  Rarely is she down in the dumps because of her cheery and happy attitude.  And because she emits this attitude, some may interpret it as freaky (because she keeps talking and cracking jokes) but for those who know her, there is a sense of comfort to have her near them.The main storyline is about the people that Poppy knows, some really well and some not well at all and how they react around her.Her best friend Zoe, who she has lived with for ten years, has a good friendship with Poppy and both are school teachers.  Zoe is a bit more of a realist but both managed to have fun in their single lives.Throughout the film, you see Poppy learn the Flamenco, go to a chiropractor for her aching back, trying to befriend a homeless man, trying to meet an employee at the bookstore, meeting up with family, trying to find out why a bully in class is beating up kids.  And each person she comes across, she gives them a dose of her personality.But she meets her challenge when she goes through driver's training and encounters a frumpy, closed-minded racist who happens to be her driver's instructor.  But for Poppy, what becomes a session of paying for driver's lessons, she looks at the opportunity to try to bring some sunshine to his life or at least get him to open up.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Happy-Go-Lucky"" is presented in Widescreen (2:35:1).  What I enjoyed about this film is that there are so many locations shot throughout London.  May it be shopping, going to a club, going out on a date, driving lessons, Flamenco lessons, etc.  So, you get a good does of color.As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound but the film is primarily a dialogue-based film.  There is use of music as well but mostly front channel usage on your home theater system.SPECIAL FEATURES:There are three special features included on the DVD for ""Happy-Go-Lucky"". Included are:* Behind the Wheel of Happy-Go-Lucky - A five minute featurette featuring behind-the-scenes footage of the driving instruction parts of the film.  Seven cameras used and how they were shot.* Happy-in-Character - A Half hour long featurette with interviews with director Mike Leigh, Sally Hawkins (Poppy), Alexis Zegerman (Zoe) and Eddie Marsan (Scott).  This was very interesting because you learn about Mike Leigh's directorial style and how he wanted the talent to become the character.  And how the film was just built overtime.  A style of filmmaking of keeping the talent out in the dark but enough for them to learn about their roles and be in character.  In fact, almost with no definitive script, the talent just knew about their characters and not so much about the overall storyline since it was written as the film progressed.  Thus, for the driving instructions, Eddie Marsan's thought his character was about a racist, depressed and dark driver's instructor and thought maybe it would be like ""Taxi Driver"" but when paired with the character of Poppy and her bubbly attitude and her constant bubbliness and jokes, he was shocked and realized that director Mike Leigh had something interesting in store for the film.* Audio Commentary by Director Mike Leigh - Mike Leigh talks about working with the talent and how fortunate he had Sally Hawkins to play Poppy.  Also, Leigh talks about how shots were done via a crane and sets up certain scenes and introducing people to certain British comments and helping the viewer understand the terminology such as ""Out for Tea"" which means ""Supper"".  There are a few periods of no commentary but overall an informative commentary.JUDGMENT CALL:When I first watched the film, I was thinking ""Seinfeld"".  Mainly because I found myself wondering where was the story going.  Was this a film about nothing but yet still manages to be hilarious?All I was seeing was Poppy interacting with all these people.  But I realized that this was the basis of the film.  Not a storyline about going from point A to point B, it was a story about interactions and how people are touched or were annoyed by Poppy's character.And after watching the special features and learning about Mike Leigh's directorial style and how he really didn't tell the talent about what the storyline was about and learning how much was improvised, you start to realize how special this film was.  From Sally Hawkins portraying Poppy, that was just amazing.  And just the back-and-forth lightning quick banter between Eddie Marsan's Scott and Hawkins Poppy during the driving instructions, I'm not sure how much of that was improvised but that was just brilliant acting.The film was a nice surprise.  It definitely was not what I was expecting and in the end, you are left with many memories and visual images of Poppy and to make a film based on character interactions with no overall plot but basically a typical days in the life of Poppy, the film was quite unique and refreshing.I was a little surprised though by the 80's fashion and at first I was wondering if the film was taking place in the late 80's or early 90's because I never expected to see acid wash jeans in a film ever again but with the talk of texting and Playstations, you realize this is a modern film.  In fact, in one of the featurettes, Marsan talks about utilizing late 80's fashion for his character.But overall, ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" was an enjoyable and an all-out fun film made believable by the wonderful performances by both Hawkins and Marsan.If you are up for something different than the norm, definitely give ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" a try.",5,"Fun, bubbly and really enjoyable.

1218674,AHPV4F8IVSC39,B001N26GFC,"Douglas B. Moran ""Computer+History/Politics""","[9, 21]","This movie is extremely unpleasant to watch.  In addition to an intensely unlikeable lead character, the plot is a mess, best seen in the Poppy character being so at odds with the movie's stated intent (from its description).I couldn't decide whether the lead character Poppy was mentally ill or just evil.  There is evidence both ways, but leans to the former.  At times she seems to be using a forced oblivious cheerfulness as a defense or coping mechanism against the serious problems in her own life.But in the relationship with the driving instructor Scott, she spots his vulnerability--that he takes pride in his work--and ruthlessly exploits it.  She is intent on making his life miserable, and to amuse herself, she is quite willing--through intentionally bad driving--to risk killing someone or destroy Scott's livelihood (his car).  An alternate interpretation is that this spreading of misery to others is a coping mechanism.One thing Poppy is not is ""happy-go-lucky"" (with the possible exception of the bike theft in the opening).  There are several instances where she drops out of the ""cheerful"" persona to behave as a responsible adult, for example the troubled boy at school and the ending (that comes out of nowhere).  An actual happy-go-lucky person would have behaved quite differently.  Also, happy-go-lucky people tend to try to spread joy, not misery, to those around them.  Instead, Poppy is relentlessly self-involved, self-absorbed, obnoxious, ...  To call her simply ""annoying"" is to miss the point.----Unfortunately, in choosing this movie, I relied solely on movie critic's reviews, not consulting Amazon, so I kept watching expecting something positive.  Recognize that the reviews here are much more negative than the simple composite score once you discount the multiple (positive) reviews that echo the movie's promotional materials.  Also, the Amazon entry under Editorial Reviews above (by Bret Fetzer) initially seems quite positive, but contains many warnings when read carefully (paying attention to word choices and phrasing).Aside: Regarding the driving instructor character Scott, Americans should understand that Britain takes a much more rigorous approach to driving instruction and tests than we do.  When I lived there (1987), I heard from other Americans with many years of driving experience that they were skeptical about their ability to pass the British test.  Scott is expected to teach students discipline, alertness and responsibility.  In their negative take on this character, the director and script writers would seem to add further weight to their presentation of anti-social behavior as being fun-loving.",1,Faux cheerfulness as a weapon to spread misery,1243641600,"05 30, 2009",2009,2662,"['movie', 'extremely', 'unpleasant', 'watch', 'addition', 'intensely', 'unlikeable', 'lead', 'character', 'plot', 'mess', 'best', 'seen', 'Poppy', 'character', 'being', 'so', 'odds', 'movie', 'stated', 'intent', 'description', '.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'lead', 'character', 'Poppy', 'was', 'mentally', 'ill', 'just', 'evil', 'evidence', 'ways', 'former', 'times', 'be', 'using', 'forced', 'oblivious', 'cheerfulness', 'defense', 'coping', 'mechanism', 'serious', 'problems', 'own', 'life.But', 'relationship', 'driving', 'instructor', 'Scott', 'spots', 'vulnerability', 'pride', 'work', 'ruthlessly', 'intent', 'making', 'life', 'miserable', 'amuse', 'quite', 'willing', 'intentionally', 'bad', 'driving', 'risk', 'killing', 'someone', 'destroy', 'Scott', 'livelihood', 'car', 'alternate', 'interpretation', 'spreading', 'misery', 'others', 'coping', 'mechanism.One', 'thing', 'Poppy', 'not', 'happy-go-lucky', 'possible', 'exception', 'bike', 'theft', 'opening', 'are', 'several', 'instances', 'where', 'cheerful', 'persona', 'behave', 'responsible', 'adult', 'example', 'troubled', 'boy', 'school', 'ending', 'nowhere', 'actual', 'happy-go-lucky', 'person', 'would', 'have', 'behaved', 'quite', 'differently', 'Also', 'happy-go-lucky', 'people', 'tend', 'try', 'spread', 'joy', 'not', 'misery', 'Instead', 'Poppy', 'relentlessly', 'self-involved', 'self-absorbed', 'obnoxious', 'call', 'simply', 'annoying', 'miss', 'point.', 'Unfortunately', 'choosing', 'movie', 'relied', 'solely', 'movie', 'critic', 'reviews', 'not', 'consulting', 'Amazon', 'kept', 'watching', 'expecting', 'something', 'positive', 'Recognize', 'reviews', 'here', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'negative', 'simple', 'composite', 'score', 'once', 'discount', 'multiple', 'positive', 'echo', 'movie', 'promotional', 'materials', 'Also', 'Amazon', 'entry', 'Editorial', 'Reviews', 'Bret', 'Fetzer', 'initially', 'quite', 'positive', 'many', 'warnings', 'when', 'read', 'carefully', 'paying', 'attention', 'word', 'choices', 'phrasing', '.Aside', 'Regarding', 'driving', 'instructor', 'character', 'Scott', 'Americans', 'should', 'understand', 'Britain', 'much', 'more', 'rigorous', 'approach', 'driving', 'instruction', 'tests', 'do', 'When', 'lived', 'there', '1987', 'heard', 'other', 'Americans', 'many', 'years', 'driving', 'experience', 'were', 'skeptical', 'ability', 'pass', 'British', 'test', 'Scott', 'expected', 'teach', 'students', 'discipline', 'alertness', 'responsibility', 'negative', 'take', 'character', 'director', 'script', 'writers', 'would', 'seem', 'add', 'further', 'weight', 'presentation', 'anti-social', 'behavior', 'being', 'fun-loving']",Happy-Go-Lucky

Not as unrealistic as some seem to indicate either- I have known at least a couple people not too unlike Polly.  Incidentally, the story does depict a more serious side to her as well, so she is a bit more multidimensional than initially meets the eye (most of the scenes showing her teaching, dealing w/ the bully in particular, show she was fully capable of being a responsible adult/teacher).As many have pointed out, including the director himself, the core of this movie involves the interaction between Polly and her driving instructor (Scott- played brilliantly by the very underrated character actor Eddie Marson).  It is worth watching this movie for the scenes involving these two alone.Yes, the movie is more a series of vignettes rather than following a cohesive storyline.

I found her constant witless, even clownish cheerfulness on top of a dull script to be a constant irritant and not even credible. Not that she was not an attractive, good-hearted person, it's that her pointless bubbly behavior being constant just gets tiresome. It doesn't have the charm and purpose of say, the ever high spirits of Amelie in that charming film of the same name. But even assuming that this ever cheerful giggle clown could be lovable to someone I don't see how that could compensate for the film's mostly dull and shallow script.The first few scenes were not just humorless, they were painfully bad and after waiting in pain for nearly an hour to see some redeeming change I had to turn it off.

I can't make it through the first half hour.There's nothing wrong with being cheerful and having a positive outlook on life. But this character goes beyond that into the realm of a human cartoon character who seems designed to annoy everyone else around them.Poppy (even the name makes this gratingly obvious) acts like a child. She wanders around looking at everything as if she's never been outside before. She wears layers of clothes with fringes and suns and flowers etc. She talks to anyone and everyone around her and just keeps talking no matter what response she gets to the point where she's prattling on about how the person doesn't want to talk to her in that person's presence. Poppy is presented as someone loveable, but really, she is so self absorbed it's hard to watch her.That would be annoying enough. But the casting just makes this character worse. Of course Poppy has a huge overbite and is constantly wearing a goofy smile with her top row of teeth jutting out as the physical embodiment of her inability to keep her mouth shut in conversational terms. She wags her tongue around, jumps up and down, interrupts her friends with gesticulations and what she thinks are friendly touches. Her hair is cut like a little girl's with big bangs and she's flips it around and plays with it while she's doing whatever she's doing.It just goes to eleven and stays there. The main plot line is triggered when she leaves her bike outside a book store. She goes inside, wanders around, tossing comments at the clerk who is busy dealing with inventory - including comments like &#34;busy busy are we? too busy to chat?&#34; After buying nothing, Poppy finds that her bike is gone when she steps out. She looks all around like it might have just wheeled itself off down the block on a lark rather than being stolen and gone. But Poppy's not going to get a new bike because she didn't get a chance to say goodbye to the old one. Instead, she's going to learn how to drive.Then Poppy's on the bus. Oh my, so crowded we're standing. Bump in the road, goofy grin and stranger next to her as if this were some amusement park ride that they've never experienced before.There's happy. There's lucky. And there's a child in an adult's body. You'd feel squeamish dating her, like a bit of a pedophile, because she's so childish.

1218685,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B001N26GFC,Joseph Haschka,"[10, 11]","HAPPY-GO-LUCKY is one of those quirky British films that won't be remembered as one of the best you've ever seen, but is worth a look and four stars because, as I said to my wife after our advance screening, it ""has its 5-star moments"".The protagonist is Poppy (Sally Hawkins), a frenetically happy, 30-year old, primary school teacher living in London's northern reaches with her roommate Zoe (Alexis Zegerman). Poppy's good humor is so inexorable that, while it serves her well with her young charges, it often abrades the patience of adults. Only Zoe is imperturbable.As with other films of the genre (Local Hero,The Full Monty,Calendar Girls,Waking Ned Devine), the plot revolves not so much around events as the personalities and eccentricities of the players.The single best overall performance is perhaps that by Eddie Marsan as the scarily intense Scott, Poppy's driving instructor, whose deep-seated, smoldering anger at the world reflects a tightly wound mental state 180 degrees opposite that of his student. Confined together in the small space of Scott's car, an explosion seems always but a hair-trigger's pull away.Definitely, the single best scene, the one that had the audience in stitches, is played by Karina Fernandez as a Flamenco teacher, when she attempts to describe to and inculcate in her class of adult students the passion necessary for the dance. Talk about meltdown!The conflict, if it can be called such, of the story comes as Poppy's happy-go-luckiness scrapes up against the unhappy lives and internal turmoil of others: the mentally unstable derelict she encounters under a bridge in a bleak industrial section of the city, her pregnant and subliminally unhappy younger sister, a bullying and disturbed boy in her class, and, above all, Scott. As the last scene fades into the film credits, the viewer is left wondering if Poppy's felicitous worldview will survive life.

1218686,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B001N26GFC,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 3]","Happy-Go-Lucky is a small British film that was one of the most acclaimed films of 2008. It didn't get any attention from the Academy, but was nominated for Best Picture at the Golden Globes and star Sally Hawkins won a Golden Globe for her performance as a perpetually happy school teacher named Poppy. As I will explain later, it wasn't her performance that most impressed me.Written and directed by Mike Leigh, Happy-Go-Lucky stars Hawkins as Poppy, an elementary school teacher who is one of those people that is always happy. One of those people who are so happy it almost makes you angry. After stopping in a bookstore, Poppy's bike is stolen, leading her to take driving lessons. Her driving instructor Scott (Eddie Marsan), who is Poppy's polar opposite; humorless and straight-forward. The two don't get along very well, but when Poppy gets involved with a social worker she unexpectedly gets a jealous reaction from Scott.I have to add that it's hard to think of Poppy as simply ""happy"" There are times when it seems like she might be slightly insane. Scott doesn't seem completely sane himself though.The film does have a consistent British charm that makes it hard to stop smiling. It has the tone of a typical romantic-comedy, but it's more well-written than any of those films with more memorable characters as well.The dialogue has its shining moments too. The banter between Scott and Poppy upon their initial meeting (and later ones) is fast-paced, brilliant, and hilarious. Scott is right when he says ""you won't forget Enraha.""Ms. Hawkins has a sort of insatiable, spunky charm that is really delightful. She doesn't give any sort of tour de force performance but she's so perfect in the role. It's a relatively simple character, yet it seems like it must have been challenging.Marsan is pitch-perfect as the no-nonsense, uptight instructor. It's Marsan I really want to talk about. He is just as impressive as Hawkins, if not more so. This is an actor that comes out of nowhere and totally nails this character, warts and all.Through the entire film, I enjoyed his presence but didn't necessarily like his character. When he confronts Poppy in the film, I found myself instantly empathizing with him. It's really a perfect, Award-worthy performance. No reviews make much mention of Marsan, but he's the true breakthrough in this film.I don't know about Happy-Go-Lucky being one of the best films of 2008, but it's a charming, somewhat sad film. It's worth recommending on the basis of its witty script and the performances of Marsan and Hawkins.GRADE: B+",4,"Charming, Amusing, Great Performance by Marsan and Hawkins",1239753600,"04 15, 2009",2009,2574,"['Happy-Go-Lucky', 'small', 'British', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'acclaimed', 'films', '2008', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'attention', 'Academy', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'star', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'performance', 'perpetually', 'happy', 'school', 'teacher', 'named', 'Poppy', 'will', 'explain', 'later', 'was', ""n't"", 'performance', 'most', 'impressed', 'me.Written', 'directed', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'Happy-Go-Lucky', 'Hawkins', 'Poppy', 'elementary', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'one', 'people', 'always', 'happy', 'One', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'happy', 'almost', 'angry', 'stopping', 'bookstore', 'Poppy', 'bike', 'stolen', 'leading', 'take', 'driving', 'lessons', 'driving', 'instructor', 'Scott', 'Eddie', 'Marsan', 'who', 'Poppy', 'polar', 'opposite', 'humorless', 'straight-forward', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'very', 'well', 'when', 'Poppy', 'involved', 'social', 'worker', 'unexpectedly', 'jealous', 'reaction', 'Scott.I', 'have', 'add', 'hard', 'think', 'Poppy', 'simply', 'happy', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'might', 'be', 'slightly', 'insane', 'Scott', ""n't"", 'seem', 'completely', 'sane', 'though.The', 'film', 'have', 'consistent', 'British', 'charm', 'hard', 'stop', 'smiling', 'tone', 'typical', 'romantic-comedy', 'more', 'well-written', 'films', 'more', 'memorable', 'characters', 'well.The', 'dialogue', 'shining', 'moments', 'too', 'banter', 'Scott', 'Poppy', 'initial', 'meeting', 'later', 'ones', 'fast-paced', 'brilliant', 'hilarious', 'Scott', 'right', 'when', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Enraha.', 'Ms', 'Hawkins', 'sort', 'insatiable', 'spunky', 'charm', 'really', 'delightful', ""n't"", 'give', 'sort', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'so', 'perfect', 'role', 'relatively', 'simple', 'character', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'challenging.Marsan', 'pitch-perfect', 'no-nonsense', 'uptight', 'instructor', 'Marsan', 'really', 'want', 'talk', 'just', 'as', 'impressive', 'Hawkins', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'actor', 'nowhere', 'totally', 'character', 'warts', 'entire', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'presence', 'did', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'like', 'character', 'When', 'Poppy', 'film', 'found', 'instantly', 'empathizing', 'really', 'perfect', 'Award-worthy', 'performance', 'reviews', 'make', 'much', 'mention', 'Marsan', 'true', 'breakthrough', 'film.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Happy-Go-Lucky', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2008', 'charming', 'somewhat', 'sad', 'film', 'worth', 'recommending', 'basis', 'witty', 'script', 'performances', 'Marsan', 'Hawkins.GRADE', 'B+']",Happy-Go-Lucky

Probably something very close to this movie, HAPPY-GO-LUCKY.The tag line for HAPPY-GO-LUCKY is: The one movie this fall that will put a smile on your face. But it didn't. I checked. I never smiled or laughed or even chuckled. I grimaced twice and cringed once, but I never smiled.HAPPY-GO-LUCKY is very much a stream of consciousness flick. Even as I type this, I am at a loss to tell you the point of the movie. I know it was about a woman, pretty, 30, a school teacher, never married, who lives with her girlfriend, has a troubled student, meets a crazy guy under a bridge, has issues with her sisters, sleeps with a social worker, and is learning to drive from a crazed conspiracy theorist. But I'm still trying divine what it's about. I did work out that the main character, Poppy, is both happy and luck because, in a bit of clever writing she says, ""I am happy. I'm a very lucky lady.""There is really nothing at all about HAPPY-GO-LUCKY that stands out. Not the acting, not the story, not the scenery, not the soundtrack, and especially not the writing - nothing. And when it was over, I felt cheated at having sat through it all with the hope that suddenly the disparate elements would congeal around one moment and I would say, ""Wow."" Sadly, that moment did come but it left me decidedly un-wowed.Now comes the worst part. I saved it for last.As if to confirm my suspicions that I will never ever be invited to be a Member of the Academy, HAPPY-GO-LUCKY was nominated for an Oscar. In addition, it has won awards from all over the world, including a Golden Arena Award at the Pula Film Festival. Yeah. You heard me right. After my review, I'm pretty sure I'll never be invited back to Pula.On the ""No Country for Old Men"" scale, HAPPY-GO-LUCKY comes in a tick or two higher simply because Poppy never says, ""Friend-o.""",1,Webcam Monkey,1250985600,"08 23, 2009",2009,1953,"['What', 'do', 'get', 'when', 'strap', 'camera', 'woman', 'head', 'just', 'film', 'days', 'nights', 'then', 'edit', 'down', '2', 'hours', 'Probably', 'something', 'very', 'close', 'movie', 'HAPPY-GO-LUCKY.The', 'tag', 'line', 'HAPPY-GO-LUCKY', 'one', 'movie', 'fall', 'will', 'put', 'smile', 'face', 'did', ""n't"", 'checked', 'never', 'smiled', 'laughed', 'even', 'chuckled', 'grimaced', 'twice', 'cringed', 'once', 'never', 'smiled.HAPPY-GO-LUCKY', 'very', 'much', 'stream', 'consciousness', 'flick', 'Even', 'type', 'am', 'loss', 'tell', 'point', 'movie', 'know', 'was', 'woman', 'pretty', '30', 'school', 'teacher', 'never', 'married', 'who', 'girlfriend', 'troubled', 'student', 'crazy', 'guy', 'bridge', 'issues', 'sisters', 'sleeps', 'social', 'worker', 'learning', 'drive', 'crazed', 'conspiracy', 'theorist', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'divine', 'what', 'did', 'work', 'out', 'main', 'character', 'Poppy', 'happy', 'luck', 'bit', 'clever', 'writing', 'am', 'happy', ""'m"", 'very', 'lucky', 'lady', 'really', 'nothing', 'HAPPY-GO-LUCKY', 'out', 'Not', 'acting', 'not', 'story', 'not', 'scenery', 'not', 'soundtrack', 'especially', 'not', 'writing', 'nothing', 'when', 'was', 'felt', 'cheated', 'having', 'sat', 'hope', 'suddenly', 'disparate', 'elements', 'would', 'congeal', 'one', 'moment', 'would', 'say', 'Wow', 'Sadly', 'moment', 'did', 'come', 'left', 'decidedly', 'un-wowed.Now', 'worst', 'part', 'saved', 'last.As', 'confirm', 'suspicions', 'will', 'never', 'ever', 'be', 'invited', 'be', 'Member', 'Academy', 'HAPPY-GO-LUCKY', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'addition', 'won', 'awards', 'world', 'including', 'Golden', 'Arena', 'Award', 'Pula', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Yeah', 'heard', 'right', 'review', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'invited', 'back', 'Pula.On', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'scale', 'HAPPY-GO-LUCKY', 'tick', 'two', 'higher', 'simply', 'Poppy', 'never', 'Friend-o']",Happy-Go-Lucky

The premise sounded interesting -- a relentlessly positive person facing life and perhaps overcoming less than positive moments.  Oh, what a let down.  Truth be told, Happy-Go-Lucky is the story of a daffy woman who we never really get to know -- a woman who laughs (at times inappropriately) at almost everything, including physical pain.  In fact, she can't bring herself to answer a straight question without giggling and coming up with some whimsical nonsense line looking to draw a laugh, avoid the question, or both.  Through all of this, she remains an ultimately irritating enigma, keeping from the audience any clue about what makes her tick, why she can't seem to take anything seriously (including the feelings of others), and why she does oddly dangerous and inappropriate things (like striking up a conversation with a brooding homeless man in the dark of night in a secluded spot -- and sticking around even after he acts in ways that might reasonably be perceived as threatening).In all of her laughter, the main character seems so incapable of listening to other people or reading their feelings that she laughs off signs that her driving instructor has significant mental problems and might be developing a threatening interest in her.  When he finally blows his lid and does something that would make any sensible person call the police -- if not for her sake, then for the sake of others who might follow -- she ultimately laughs it off while paddling down life's highway, oblivious, it seems, to real human interaction and the need for some grain of seriousness to make all the laughter have any worth at all.",2,Happy-Go-Nothing,1263081600,"01 10, 2010",2010,1678,"['Going', 'Happy-Go-Lucky', 'wanted', 'premise', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'relentlessly', 'positive', 'person', 'facing', 'life', 'perhaps', 'overcoming', 'less', 'positive', 'moments', 'Oh', 'what', 'let', 'down', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'Happy-Go-Lucky', 'story', 'daffy', 'woman', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'woman', 'who', 'times', 'inappropriately', 'almost', 'everything', 'including', 'physical', 'pain', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'answer', 'straight', 'question', 'giggling', 'coming', 'up', 'whimsical', 'nonsense', 'line', 'looking', 'draw', 'laugh', 'avoid', 'question', 'ultimately', 'irritating', 'enigma', 'keeping', 'audience', 'clue', 'what', 'tick', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'take', 'anything', 'seriously', 'including', 'feelings', 'others', 'why', 'oddly', 'dangerous', 'inappropriate', 'things', 'striking', 'up', 'conversation', 'brooding', 'homeless', 'man', 'dark', 'night', 'secluded', 'spot', 'sticking', 'around', 'even', 'ways', 'might', 'reasonably', 'be', 'perceived', 'threatening', '.In', 'laughter', 'main', 'character', 'so', 'incapable', 'listening', 'other', 'people', 'reading', 'feelings', 'signs', 'driving', 'instructor', 'significant', 'mental', 'problems', 'might', 'be', 'developing', 'threatening', 'interest', 'When', 'finally', 'lid', 'something', 'would', 'make', 'sensible', 'person', 'call', 'police', 'not', 'sake', 'then', 'sake', 'others', 'who', 'might', 'follow', 'ultimately', 'off', 'paddling', 'down', 'life', 'highway', 'oblivious', 'real', 'human', 'interaction', 'need', 'grain', 'seriousness', 'make', 'laughter', 'have', 'worth']",Happy-Go-Lucky

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[7, 7]","Happy-Go-Lucky stars Sally Hawkins as Poppy, a 30 year old London elementary school teacher who is so cheerful she makes Pollyanna look like Eeyore.The film doesn't follow any Hollywood formula, so here is fair advance warning.  You may not like ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" if:1. You dislike ""British Humor"".2. You have difficulty following non-American English.3. You dislike films without a definite or obvious ""plot"".There is a decidedly British genre that I would loosely describe as ""get a handful of interesting characters together and follow them a few days"". (I recently watched ""The Station Agent"" and although the characters and setting were different, it shares this genre.)Poppy isn't just cheerful.  She finds almost any situation a suitable one for a joke and a laugh.  In the opening she rides her bicycle to a bookstore where she tries unsuccessfully to get the attention of the bearded young man who works there.  She goes outside to discover her bicycle has been stolen.  She is disappointed and says ""I didn't even get to say good-bye!""The stolen bike leads Poppy to decide to take driving lessons.  She hires the increasingly serious and severely humorless Scott, played by Eddie Marsan.  Some of the funniest scenes in the film and certainly the most serious one take place during Poppy's driving lessons.Poppy has shared a flat with Zoe for ten years, and she has two younger sisters who don't share her irrepressible cheery disposition.I could give you the entire ""plot"" and although I wouldn't be giving you many ""spoilers"", I also wouldn't be giving you much encouragement to watch the movie.The Mrs. and I laughed out loud several times.

Somehow this added to the experience of the film, which is about a positively positive young woman, Poppy (Sally Hawkins, just brilliant) who just won't let anything stand in her way of enjoying her life and loving everyone in it as much as she can -- until she meets her anti-human match in Scott (Eric Marsan), a frighteningly angry, racist and sexist driving instructor who probably ought to be locked up, or at least not having such contact with the general public. Poppy's a working class girl in Mike Leigh's modern-day London, and that means full of quirks and foibles and not in the least bit glamorous or obvious; much of the charm in the film as in most of the Leigh films I've seen is in not knowing what's going to come next, except that it will be unusual -- but never untrue.Poppy has a couple of sisters, a best friend, and the beginnings of a relationship to contend with along with her crazy driver training class (necessitated by the theft of her bike through typical carelessness in the first scene) and she navigates all of them with her chin up -- though never with her brain turned off. I'm sure there are some who will be very irritated with this blast of sun through the rainbow, but speaking as a depressive who typically hates Pollyanna characters -- I just loved her - and the film.At the end, when Poppy and Scott have hit a point of no return, my emotions really went through the ringer - and I think I started to see what Poppy was missing, and that perhaps she knew that she was missing it. Her failure to understand misery is in some ways just as limiting to her understanding of other people and the world as Scott's inability to ever forget it, though it's much less destructive. As she goes for a boat ride I'm reminded of Jacques Rivette's ""Celine and Julie Go Boating"", a fantasy different in almost every respect from this dose of hard reality and broad humor - but I think that Poppy, like the characters in that film, knows that she's in some ways living in a fantasy world of her own making.

Not that it matters, as you will have turned it off long before you get to that point, but still.- - -I persist in the belief, for some reason I am quite incapable of figuring out, that Mike Leigh will eventually make a film that will not make me want to kill myself within five minutes of my starting to watch it. And so I continue to watch Mike Leigh movies. I'm sure my therapist is very happy with this arrangement. The most recent one to cross my path is &lt;em>Happy-Go-Lucky&lt;/em>, which was, inexplicably, nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay (the movie was also written by Leigh). But then, &lt;em>Sideways&lt;/em> was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay as well, and that made just as little sense. And it WON!Plot: Poppy (&lt;em>Made in Dagenham&lt;/em>'s Sally Hawkins) is a 30-year-old preschool teacher living in London. The title of the film gives you a clue into her personality, albeit a quite understated one. Poppy is manic at her calmest times, stubbornly refuses to look at life in any sort of logical manner, and repeatedly puts herself into situations where, in the real world, she would be in imminent danger of losing her life. That all of this is glossed over (with the underlying ""just let go of your worries and be happy-go-lucky and all will be right with your life!"" message, which is of course a load of complete codswallop) is one of the defining points of the film. If you have no problems with that, and with Poppy's personality, you will probably like this. In any case, I digress. Thanks to Poppy's bike being stolen, she decides she needs to, at long last, learn to drive a car. The instructor assigned to her by the driving school is Scott (&lt;em>V for Vendetta&lt;/em>'s Eddie Marsan), who is Poppy's polar opposite in every way that's important (at least to the film). While Poppy's driving lessons are only one part of an ensemble piece, they quickly become the main focus of the film, culminating in... the most predictable opposites-attract storyline imaginable.Except that Mike Leigh can't even get THAT right. There is not one iota of indication anywhere in this film until Scott's big climactic blow-up that he is in any way attracted to Poppy (and to Leigh's ever-so-minor credit, that single fact is the only thing that makes Poppy's reaction during that scene even remotely acceptable). It's a climax without a storyline. Okay, I exaggerate a bit. There is one scene that gives it away, though it could also be interpreted as either ""wow, creepy stalker dude!"" or ""hey, isn't it interesting that we live a block from one another?"" (Which is how I interpreted it... right up until writing that last paragraph, actually.) But this is synecdochic of the entire film, which is filled with episodic set pieces that are supposed to be pregnant with importance (and, I'm sure, are supposed to tie back to the driving-lesson plotline). But here's the thing... they never are. This is an emperor who has no clothes at all. Why this continues to surprise me in the case of Mike Leigh is entirely beyond me. Perhaps, finally, I will give up after seeing this, an even worse film than &lt;em>Topsy-Turvy&lt;/em>.

I know of absolutely no director who has gotten more superb performances out of actresses over the past 15 years than Leigh.  We've seen not one, not two, but three absolutely stellar performances in three of his films in which actresses turned in what were consensus international choices as the best performances that year by actresses.  The one and only awards organization to consistently ignore these performances have been the Oscars.  In 1996 Brenda Blethyn won every single Best Actress award in the world for SECRETS AND LIES (well over 20 awards in all), all except the Oscar (which Frances McDormand won for her excellent but vastly less impressive performance in FARGO).  Then in 2004 Imelda Staunton was almost universally acclaimed the Best Actress for the title role of VERA DRAKE, but Hillary Swank (like Frances McDormand, in one of her few wins over Staunton) won the Oscar for MILLION DOLLAR BABY.  Now in 2008 Sally Hawkins won a shelf full of awards for her extraordinary performance as Poppy (including the Golden Globe and the NY Film Critics Circle Award, in addition to many others).  So how did she do at the Oscars?  Would you believe that she wasn't even nominated?  I've become increasingly dismissive of the Oscars over the years, primarily because they rarely recognize true excellence and give awards based on familiarity and popularity (McDormand over Blethyn, Swank over Staunton).  So of course the Oscars failed to even nominate what was perhaps the finest performance by any actress in 2008.The wonderful thing about this movie is how we get to know and like Poppy.  The film has little or no plot so what drive it has comes from our silent witnessing of how she lives her life, always upbeat, joking, and kidding.  We see her in her trampoline class.  We see her taking flamenco lessons. We see her giddily get an adjustment from a chiropractor.  And, most of all, we see her taking driving lessons with a fascinating but mentally and emotionally unstable driving instructor (brilliantly portrayed by Eddie Marsan) who becomes oddly attracted to her.  We get to see Poppy from a number of perspectives and as we see her happily and compassionately making her way through life, we come to love her and pull for her.  I think ultimately whether you love, like, or hate this movie will inevitably depend on your reaction to Poppy.  Sally Hawkins endows her with such passion and pluck that I loved her despite finding her jocularity sometimes a tad grating.  And while by no means a beauty, Hawkins through the force of her personality makes Poppy surprisingly attractive.I was not terribly familiar with Sally Hawkins prior to this film.  I remember her from VERA DRAKE, but nothing else.  I do plan on seeing the most recent adaptation of Jane Austen's PERSUASION, in which she had the lead role.  Hopefully she'll be in a long string of movies that I can enjoy her in in the future.",5,An absolutely delightful introduction to an extremely loveable character,1241049600,"04 30, 2009",2009,3741,"['one', 'films', 'whole', 'greater', 'sum', 'parts', 'end', 'film', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'consequence', 'happened', 'entire', 'affair', 'slice', 'life', 'movie', 'focused', 'entirely', 'small', 'typical', 'moments', 'irrepressibly', 'chipper', 'upbeat', '30-year-old', 'Londoner', 'named', 'Poppy', 'get', 'glimpses', 'social', 'life', 'professional', 'life', 'romantic', 'life', 'recreational', 'life', 'attempt', 'learn', 'drive.The', 'film', 'buoyed', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'usual', 'light', 'yet', 'deft', 'touch', 'always', 'managing', 'get', 'ways', 'allow', 'actors', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'usual', 'actors', 'are', 'better', 'films', 'are', 'just', 'anything', 'do', 'Leigh', 'consistently', 'best', 'opportunities', 'actresses', 'other', 'director', 'active', 'today', 'know', 'absolutely', 'director', 'who', 'gotten', 'more', 'superb', 'performances', 'actresses', 'past', '15', 'years', 'Leigh', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'not', 'one', 'not', 'two', 'three', 'absolutely', 'stellar', 'performances', 'three', 'films', 'actresses', 'turned', 'what', 'were', 'consensus', 'international', 'choices', 'best', 'performances', 'year', 'actresses', 'one', 'only', 'awards', 'organization', 'consistently', 'ignore', 'performances', 'have', 'been', 'Oscars', '1996', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'won', 'single', 'Best', 'Actress', 'award', 'world', 'SECRETS', 'AND', 'LIES', 'well', '20', 'awards', 'Oscar', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'won', 'excellent', 'vastly', 'less', 'impressive', 'performance', 'FARGO', 'Then', '2004', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'was', 'almost', 'universally', 'acclaimed', 'Best', 'Actress', 'title', 'role', 'VERA', 'DRAKE', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'one', 'few', 'wins', 'Staunton', 'won', 'Oscar', 'MILLION', 'DOLLAR', 'BABY', 'Now', '2008', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'won', 'shelf', 'full', 'awards', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'Poppy', 'including', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'NY', 'Film', 'Critics', 'Circle', 'Award', 'addition', 'many', 'others', 'how', 'did', 'do', 'Oscars', 'Would', 'believe', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'nominated', ""'ve"", 'become', 'increasingly', 'dismissive', 'Oscars', 'years', 'primarily', 'rarely', 'recognize', 'true', 'excellence', 'give', 'awards', 'based', 'familiarity', 'popularity', 'McDormand', 'Blethyn', 'Swank', 'Staunton', 'So', 'course', 'Oscars', 'failed', 'even', 'nominate', 'what', 'was', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'performance', 'actress', '2008.The', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'movie', 'how', 'get', 'know', 'Poppy', 'film', 'little', 'plot', 'so', 'what', 'drive', 'silent', 'witnessing', 'how', 'life', 'always', 'upbeat', 'joking', 'kidding', 'see', 'trampoline', 'class', 'see', 'taking', 'flamenco', 'lessons', 'see', 'giddily', 'get', 'adjustment', 'chiropractor', 'most', 'see', 'taking', 'driving', 'lessons', 'fascinating', 'mentally', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'driving', 'instructor', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Eddie', 'Marsan', 'who', 'oddly', 'attracted', 'get', 'see', 'Poppy', 'number', 'perspectives', 'see', 'happily', 'compassionately', 'making', 'way', 'life', 'come', 'love', 'pull', 'think', 'ultimately', 'love', 'hate', 'movie', 'will', 'inevitably', 'depend', 'reaction', 'Poppy', 'Sally', 'such', 'passion', 'pluck', 'loved', 'finding', 'jocularity', 'sometimes', 'tad', 'grating', 'beauty', 'Hawkins', 'force', 'personality', 'Poppy', 'surprisingly', 'attractive.I', 'was', 'not', 'terribly', 'familiar', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'prior', 'film', 'remember', 'VERA', 'DRAKE', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'plan', 'seeing', 'most', 'recent', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'PERSUASION', 'had', 'lead', 'role', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'be', 'long', 'string', 'movies', 'can', 'enjoy', 'future']",Happy-Go-Lucky

Zwick,"[3, 3]","***1/2If Debbie Downer were bi-polar, her opposite half might well be peppy ""Poppy,"" a perpetually upbeat thirty-year-old elementary school teacher whom no vicissitude of life could ever hope to faze.  Poppy seems utterly impervious to either hard times or bad news as she giggles and chortles her way around London, going to work, hanging out with her buddies, or taking driving lessons from a stuffy, humorless instructor who may be developing a more-than-professional interest in his client.In terms of structure, Mike Leigh's ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" has an aimlessness and a formlessness that is both the movie's greatest asset and its most problematic weakness.  This approach does make the story feel less contrived and more realistic, but it also robs the movie of some of the cohesion, drama and emotional power it might have had had it been more formally designed.In a similar way, Sally Hawkins has been assigned the extraordinarily challenging task of bringing an aura of likeability to a character who, if you met her in real life, would probably drive you straight over the edge after a mere five minutes in her presence.  Luckily, Hawkins is largely successful in toning down at least some of Poppy`s more egregiously irritating mannerisms, and in the rare moments when the character is allowed to actually behave like an honest-to-God grownup woman, Hawkins wins us over completely.  Eddie Marsan also scores big as the rage-filled, uptight driving instructor who, in a wonderfully explosive scene that is the verbal equivalent of a slap in the face, finally confronts Poppy with a few unattractive truths about herself.It's nice to come across a character who isn't all depressed and angst-ridden about life for a change, and Poppy certainly seems to have found a niche in the world that works for her.

1218708,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B001N26GFC,Scott Schiefelbein,"[3, 4]","Mike Leigh's ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" has a lot to recommend it, not least being a star turn by little-known (at least on this side of the pond) Sally Hawkins as Poppy, the happy-go-lucky character of the title.  Poppy is a human cherry soda with a healthy splash of vodka - full of life, almost overly sweet, and just a bit dangerous.It's interesting that someone could make a movie where the key question is, can someone really go through life reacting to every single thing with a positive attitude?  Such a person is Poppy, an effervescent bohemian elementary school teacher in London.  Poppy's the kind of gal who responds to her bike being stolen as creating an opportunity to drive.  She responds to virtually every line in a conversation with a little joke or pun and a friendly snicker.  She's not a wise-acre, or a comedian who's ""always on"" - she's just walking on the sunny side of the street every blasted day.Life eventually conspires to put roadblocks in her path as she meets new people, including the troubled, the homeless, and the perfect (a late-movie candidate for Serious Boyfriend is just a bit too much from Central Casting to be believed).  Some of these folks react to Poppy with delight, others with fear, and one in particular with blinding rage as her friendliness is mistaken for flirtatiousness.  Eventually even Poppy confronts a person that even she cannot abide.Why only three stars?  Perhaps I'm being unfair - I like much of this movie, not least the fact that ""HGL"" is one of those charming British movies where you almost need subtitles to understand the dialect.  This isn't a movie where Judie Dench is ripping off perfectly enunciated sentences to John Gielgud - this is a Street Movie where characters talk like real people.  Sure, you lose something in the process, but the rhythm gets you where you need to go.Unfortunately the sad fact is that this movie is essentially without a plot.  The story is just about Poppy and her daily life.  We see her interact with a few people, many of whom are in one scene and then vanish.  Sure, there's a bit of conflict with her driving instructor and a bit of romance, but essentially we're watching Poppy waltz through life.  I confess that I like a bit more plot on the bones of my movies - it's the same reason why ""2001"" has never done anything for me.  Perhaps that makes me a Philistine, but there you go.I also have grave problems with one scene where Poppy goes off by herself at night to confront a homeless man.  Poppy, a super-sweet girl who just might be able to take down a butterfly as long as it didn't get the jump on her, should know much better than to take such a stupid risk in London.  Perpetual cheerfulness is fine, but it doesn't help you in every situation.  My problem with this scene is that it was so unrealistic and stupid a maneuver that it reminded me that I was watching a movie.  It reminded me to stop suspending my disbelief, and everything that followed this scene felt contrived.As a result, I must put ""HGL"" in the category of Good Film That I Have No Interest in Watching Again for a Long Time, if Ever.

1218710,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B001N26GFC,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[1, 2]","Happy-Go-Lucky chronicles several days in the life of Poppy (Sally Hawkins), an intensely cheerful London primary school teacher. As she takes driving lessons from a bitter instructor (Eddie Marsan), attends a Flamenco class, parties with her roommate Zoe (Alexis Zegerman), tends to a troubled student, and visits her married sister Helen (Caroline Martin), her irrepressibly sunny disposition affords her both happiness and a few unexpected confrontations.The authentic performances director Mike Leigh coaxes from his always talented cast is easily the most impressive thing behind his latest dramedy. However, the characters themselves are often so depressingly enthusiastic that the heavy realism between their conversations is lost to their ability to annoy general audiences not accustomed to such presumably unrealistic personas. Undoubtedly people like Sally Hawkins' Poppy do exist - but watching them in a film is not nearly as much fun as mocking them in real life.And real life is a subject closely examined in Happy-Go-Lucky. Constant attempts at realism are evident, especially in the way Leigh directs his actors - starting without a script, having the characters only ever interact with others as they would in the world of the story, and keeping the actors ignorant of any of the plot elements outside of what their characters would know about. And yet with all of the so-called realism, much of it is too hard to buy. Poppy's ability to shut out all of the negative influences on her permanently cheery disposition is commendable, but when she arrives in potentially dangerous situations, it borders on simplemindedness. Fear for wellbeing is something Poppy's chipper attitude doesn't account for, though it does provide a wide spectrum of her unbiased tolerance to all.Poppy's character is an infinitely intriguing one as her extreme enthusiasm and optimism rarely affects others in a predictable way. A bookstore clerk seems perpetually annoyed, a social worker charmed, her sister Helen reacts jealously, and her chiding taunts and jokes to the pessimistic Scott causes anything but the desired effect. Even with several negative responses to her delighted demeanor, she never allows such criticism to change her outlook on life and her accomplishments. In this world of eccentric characters that Mike Leigh has created, perhaps Poppy is the most normal of them all.- The Massie Twins",3,Happy-Go-Lucky Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1224806400,"10 24, 2008",2008,2407,"['Happy-Go-Lucky', 'chronicles', 'several', 'days', 'life', 'Poppy', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'intensely', 'cheerful', 'London', 'primary', 'school', 'teacher', 'driving', 'lessons', 'bitter', 'instructor', 'Eddie', 'Marsan', 'Flamenco', 'class', 'parties', 'roommate', 'Zoe', 'Alexis', 'Zegerman', 'troubled', 'student', 'married', 'sister', 'Helen', 'Caroline', 'Martin', 'irrepressibly', 'sunny', 'disposition', 'happiness', 'few', 'unexpected', 'confrontations.The', 'authentic', 'performances', 'director', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'coaxes', 'always', 'talented', 'cast', 'easily', 'most', 'impressive', 'thing', 'latest', 'dramedy', 'However', 'characters', 'are', 'often', 'so', 'depressingly', 'enthusiastic', 'heavy', 'realism', 'conversations', 'lost', 'ability', 'annoy', 'general', 'audiences', 'not', 'accustomed', 'such', 'presumably', 'unrealistic', 'personas', 'Undoubtedly', 'people', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'Poppy', 'do', 'exist', 'watching', 'film', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'mocking', 'real', 'life.And', 'real', 'life', 'subject', 'closely', 'examined', 'Happy-Go-Lucky', 'Constant', 'attempts', 'realism', 'are', 'evident', 'especially', 'way', 'Leigh', 'actors', 'starting', 'script', 'having', 'characters', 'only', 'ever', 'interact', 'others', 'would', 'world', 'story', 'keeping', 'actors', 'ignorant', 'plot', 'elements', 'what', 'characters', 'would', 'know', 'yet', 'so-called', 'realism', 'much', 'too', 'hard', 'buy', 'Poppy', 'ability', 'shut', 'out', 'negative', 'influences', 'permanently', 'cheery', 'disposition', 'commendable', 'when', 'potentially', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'simplemindedness', 'Fear', 'wellbeing', 'something', 'Poppy', 'chipper', 'attitude', ""n't"", 'account', 'provide', 'wide', 'spectrum', 'unbiased', 'tolerance', 'all.Poppy', 'character', 'infinitely', 'intriguing', 'one', 'extreme', 'enthusiasm', 'optimism', 'rarely', 'others', 'predictable', 'way', 'bookstore', 'clerk', 'perpetually', 'annoyed', 'social', 'worker', 'charmed', 'sister', 'Helen', 'jealously', 'chiding', 'taunts', 'jokes', 'pessimistic', 'Scott', 'anything', 'desired', 'effect', 'Even', 'several', 'negative', 'responses', 'delighted', 'demeanor', 'never', 'such', 'criticism', 'change', 'outlook', 'life', 'accomplishments', 'world', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'created', 'perhaps', 'Poppy', 'most', 'normal', 'all.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",Happy-Go-Lucky
1218711,A2HDX4GNEB38GD,B001N26GFC,Thomas McNeil,"[2, 5]","I have a hard time explaining to others why Mike Leigh is among my favorite directors.  His films don't have brilliantly complex plots or uniquely beautiful visual style or many of the other traits that most people associate with great directors.  He is, however, an excellent scriptwriter - he's created several of the most intriguing characters in cinema - and an excellent director of actors.  But even that doesn't really explain why he would be among my favorite directors - and I don't know how to explain it, other than to say that his films impact me on a gut level.  I find them tremendously moving and moral and beautiful.  They make me laugh and they make me cry.  I can understand why some find his style of ""social realism"" to be boring, but to me they are far from boring or simple.  In fact, few films involve me and move me as much as his.""Happy-Go-Lucky"" is another masterpiece from Mike Leigh.  As with most of his films, there is no real villain, and not much of a plot - but it is still very funny, and very moving.  It may be among his most simple efforts, but it is far from shallow - as with all of his films, the sometimes mundane events of the plot hide complex and profound truths.  Sally Hawkins is marvelous as Poppy, who is, depending on the viewer, one of the most endearing or one of the most annoying characters to appear in quite some time depending on the viewer.  Eddie Marsan is equally fantastic as her bitter, conspiracy theorist driving instructor.It's not exactly a feel-good comedy as some of the advertisements (and DVD menus) will have you believe - but it is ultimately a positive film, that may just reaffirm your faith in humanity.",5,Funny and moving and wonderful,1240012800,"04 18, 2009",2009,1677,"['have', 'hard', 'time', 'explaining', 'others', 'why', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'favorite', 'directors', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'brilliantly', 'complex', 'plots', 'uniquely', 'beautiful', 'visual', 'style', 'many', 'other', 'traits', 'most', 'people', 'associate', 'great', 'directors', 'however', 'excellent', 'scriptwriter', 'created', 'several', 'most', 'intriguing', 'characters', 'cinema', 'excellent', 'director', 'actors', 'even', ""n't"", 'really', 'explain', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'favorite', 'directors', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'explain', 'other', 'say', 'films', 'impact', 'gut', 'level', 'find', 'tremendously', 'moving', 'moral', 'beautiful', 'make', 'make', 'cry', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'find', 'style', 'social', 'realism', 'be', 'boring', 'are', 'far', 'boring', 'simple', 'fact', 'few', 'films', 'involve', 'move', 'as', 'much', 'Happy-Go-Lucky', 'masterpiece', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'most', 'films', 'real', 'villain', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'still', 'very', 'funny', 'very', 'moving', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'simple', 'efforts', 'far', 'shallow', 'films', 'sometimes', 'mundane', 'events', 'plot', 'hide', 'complex', 'profound', 'truths', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'marvelous', 'Poppy', 'who', 'depending', 'viewer', 'one', 'most', 'endearing', 'one', 'most', 'annoying', 'characters', 'appear', 'quite', 'time', 'depending', 'viewer', 'Eddie', 'Marsan', 'equally', 'fantastic', 'bitter', 'conspiracy', 'theorist', 'driving', 'instructor.It', 'not', 'exactly', 'feel-good', 'comedy', 'advertisements', 'DVD', 'menus', 'will', 'have', 'believe', 'ultimately', 'positive', 'film', 'may', 'just', 'reaffirm', 'faith', 'humanity']",Happy-Go-Lucky
1218712,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B001N26GFC,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 3]","If you've never seen a film by British director Mike Leigh before, ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" might be the perfect choice for you.Leigh makes films in a fairly unique way. He gathers a group of unknown actors, provides them with an outline, and watches the group as they begin to improvise their lines and work out the situations. In this way, he is able to capture dialogue and situations, which seem real because the actors are interjecting their own personalities and backgrounds into the roles. Even though he tends to work with unknown actors, actors in his films have gone on to lengthy and prolific careers and he has also re-teamed with people after they have made a name for themselves. Jim Broadbent and Timothy Spall stand out as good examples of the Leigh School. His film ""Vera Drake"" introduced Imelda Staunton, a little known British actress to the world and she has since appeared in a number of films, including one of the ""Harry Potter"" films and ""Freedom Writers"". Generally, Leigh's films are about the British lower class, people struggling very hard to just scrape by. Because of this, his films tend to be depressing showing a group of people on the brink of emotional and financial collapse. They are well made, but the subject matter is usually a bit of a downer. So, when he makes films like ""Topsy-Turvy"", his biopic about Gilbert and Sullivan, and now ""Happy-Go-Lucky"", they show the true breadth of his skill.Poppy (Sally Hawkins, ""Cassandra's Dream"", ""Vera Drake"", ""All or Nothing"") is a young woman living with her younger sister and a friend in a small flat. She has a good job (teaching kindergarten students), a good group of friends and co-workers and a very positive outlook on life. When she leaves a bookstore and realizes her bike has been stolen, rather than get depressed and mad, she decides to get some driving lessons, to make the fateful plunge. Her driving instructor, Scott (Eddie Marsan, ""Mission Impossible III"", ""Vera Drake"", ""V for Vendetta"", ""Miami Vice"") is a very angry man and this anger is so completely at odds with Poppy's outlook that she considers it more of a challenge than anything else. As their lessons continue, the duo gets more and more frustrated with each other taking their relationship to new places. At the same time, Poppy realizes one of her students may be acting out due to abuse and calls in a counselor. Tim (Samuel Roukin) arrives and begins to get to the heart of the matter. But he also wants to get to know Poppy better and they set up a date.Because Leigh lets his actors work out the dialogue and reactions through improvisation, capturing the best and most truthful bits of their exercises, his films have a real air of authenticity about them. Much of what the actors say appears to be coming from a place in their subconscious, or their history, allowing the actors to give their characters a large chunk of their own personal history.This style of filmmaking seems especially relevant in the interactions between Poppy and Scott, and this becomes the spine of the film. Scott seems to take an almost instant dislike to Poppy; she is so completely what he isn't. He is serious, angry and very, very professional. She is happy, ready and willing to joke and takes little seriously and seems only out to have a good time. As soon as she enters his car, he comments about the boots she is wearing, and how they can't provide her with the control she needs to operate an automobile. He insists she wear more sensible shoes for their next lesson. But Poppy jokes about how good they make her look and seems to barely hear him. As their lessons continue, and Scott becomes angrier and angrier, Poppy seems to view his attitude as a challenge and tries to get to the heart of the matter, to find out what happened in his life to make him so angry and bitter. Scott isn't stupid and although some of her questions clearly cut deep, causing him to pause for a moment, he just becomes angrier and more persistent.Sally Hawkins is very good as Poppy. There appears to be nothing that will get this woman into a bad mood. When she finds her bike is missing, she is merely sad because she wasn't able to say goodbye. A surly bookstore clerk fails to ruin her day. And when she becomes concerned about a pupil, she is naturally concerned, but also hopeful that she and her colleagues can help the young boy out. In fact, Poppy is so happy and upbeat, she almost becomes annoying. Hawkins walks a very fine line, very fine, between an interesting, unique character and the type of person who just seems annoying, making most normal people cringe with the first word.But as I watched the film, I got used to Poppy. I realized part of my annoyance with her character was that I am not used to people like her. Most people in my life, most people that I know of, have down times, moody times, and I know of very few people who are happy all the time. So, when Hawkins paints Poppy as such a positive, upbeat person, it is a little hard to bear at first. Poppy defends her life, stating she's got a good job, a great group of friends, nice family. Things could be better, things could be worse. She is just uncommonly upbeat and her friends seem to really enjoy being with her and around her.Eddie Marsan is also very good as Scott. Scott is complicated and it will take more than a little prodding for Poppy to be able to work her magic. But she thinks she is up for the challenge. His performance is so good because he proves to be more than Poppy's equal. If she is overly happy and overly upbeat, Scott wears all of the years of disappointment on his face, all of the trials appear every time his eyes swerve towards Poppy. He shows so much emotion, but also seems to change his feelings on the turn of a dime. Initially, he is all business, but as soon as Poppy gets in his car, he is annoyed at her lack of preparation and attention to detail. As Poppy tries to get him to loosen up, there seems to be a moment when he considers this, his facial features seem to lighten a little. Then he realizes this is a woman who is probably like all of the other women who have wronged him and he returns to his previous, stern persona. With each of their encounters, Scott seems more on the edge of letting go, which makes him all the more determined to remain steadfast and bitter. And this serves to make Poppy all the more determined to try to help Scott, to get to the heart of the matter.The dynamic between Poppy and Scott is what makes the film so interesting. We have very few examples of two characters meeting and interacting in such a unique and interesting way. As we watch them interact we feel like we are watching two real people as they deal with their own problems.There is a less successful attempt to introduce another such character into Poppy's life; she attends a Flamenco dance class with her school's head master and the teacher is suitably eccentric, suitably wild and emotional. But this character isn't as fleshed out as Scott and the relationship and the dance instructor seem more like caricatures.Towards the end of the film, Poppy meets Tim (Samuel Roukin) and their budding relationship adds a nice touch and proves that Poppy has many reasons to be so ""Happy-Go-Lucky"".",4,"Almost too ""Happy-Go-Lucky""",1225584000,"11 2, 2008",2008,7257,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'seen',

1218713,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B001N26GFC,Westley,"[4, 8]","Poppy - the titular happy-go-lucky - is a 30-year-old single teacher played by Sally Hawkins.  She lives with a female friend and enjoys her single life, which includes drinking with friends in pubs and riding around on her bike.  One day, her bike is stolen, and she decides to take driving lessons instead of replacing the bike.  Enter her driving teacher, the unfriendly, overly serious Scott (Eddie Marsan).""Happy-Go-Lucky"" received very good reviews and several Golden Globe nominations, including Best Picture Musical or Comedy.  Thus, I was expecting a light, comedic movie.  However, ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" is anything but a comedy.  Mike Leigh's ""comedies"" are often underlined with a rather morose sadness, but ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" takes this trend a step further.  Poppy is superficially cheerful and optimistic, but her forced cheerfulness seems to be a means of covering her inability to cope with uncomfortable situations, like a nervous laugh.  Listening to her constant giggles and snorts is extremely grating.  The driving scenes are particularly irritating, with Poppy nervously giggling and snorting nonstop and Eddie angrily yelling for Poppy to pay attention.  There are a few laughs in a segment involving an emotionally unstable flamenco dance teacher, which is quite funny but also pretty much disconnected from the rest of the film.As a comedy, ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" fails miserably.  How about as a drama then?  Well, as a drama it also falls short as the main character is so thoroughly annoying that it's hard to root for her or care about her life.  This movie, however, has obviously appealed to some audiences and critics; some people seem drawn to Poppy and her life.  I'd say that if you like Mike Leigh in general, you'll like this film much better than I did.  I don't generally like Leigh's films, aside from the superb ""Topsy Turvy"" (1999).  I like ""Topsy Turvy"" because it seems more scripted than his other works; he's famous for having only a script outline and then working with his actors to ""improvise"" the action.  Unfortunately, the improvisation is all too apparent here, especially with some of the supporting actors who are extremely stiff and seem as though they're acting in a different film.

If you can imagine Annie Hall in short skirts and brilliant hues, you've got Poppy's attire nailed - always wrestling at least one oversized bag, lots of bits and pieces flapping in the breeze.A few things save this from silly pointlessness. Rather than simple mania, Poppy's bright view of the world is a choice, one that she maintains with effort that rarely shows. The effort does come out, once in a while, though, like when she deals with that troubled child in her class, wound-too-tight sister, homeless man, or stalker. They cut to her serious core - but, if wounds healed the way blows to Poppy's optimism do, most emergency rooms would shut down for lack of business.I could have wished for a little more closure regarding that troubled child.

1218715,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001N26GFC,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","Honestly, I can't quite see this as a comedy, more of a character study and human drama. Sally Hawkins plays the eternally optimistic and highly cheerful [annoyingly so at times] primary [elementary] school teacher Poppy, who goes through life smiling & bouncing along, attired in mind-boggling, outrageous outfits in brilliant, bold colors. When Poppy's bicycle gets stolen, she shrugs it off and begins driving lessons under the tutelage of acerbic and uptight Scott [Eddie Marsan]. Both these individuals are poles apart, and the driving scenes had some of the truly hilarious and maddening scenes in the movie [en-ra-ha! en-ra-ha! goes Scott, as he vainly tries to get Poppy focused on driving, whilst she's busy looking at squirrels whilst behind the wheel!].What works - Sally Hawkins [who was amazing in the BBC period drama ""Persuasion""] is credible in her role as the upbeat and happy Poppy. She is 30, single, has lived with a female flatmate [who's also her BFF] for 10 years, and is okay with it [despite her younger, married and pregnant sister's remonstrations that she get a 'real' life]. This is an individual that seems utterly at ease with her life, taking flamenco lessons from an emotionally distraught dance instructor [another highlight of the film are the dance lessons and the emotional outbursts by the instructor]. Yet, despite Hawkins' convincing [and yes, annoying] performance, there seems to be something darker underneath - as though this eternal cheerfulness and upbeat manner is masking Polly's own awkwardness in some situations. I just got the sense [perhaps I'm wrong] that this over-cheerful manner wasn't all natural.The movie also seems choppy in its storytelling - some of the scenes don't really mesh- it's like a series of different stories being put together to form a movie. As I mentioned earlier, I didn't really see this as a comedy, more of a character study. The supporting cast are credible enough, but the almost manic driving instructor, as portrayed by Eddie Marsan was especially compelling in his performance, spittle and all. I'd have given it 4*, but the movie was too long, at almost 2 hrs, and could have been better with some editing.",3,"An engaging, though overly long drama",1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,2194,"['Honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'see', 'comedy', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'human', 'drama', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', 'eternally', 'optimistic', 'highly', 'cheerful', '[', 'annoyingly', 'so', 'times', ']', 'primary', '[', 'elementary', ']', 'school', 'teacher', 'Poppy', 'who', 'life', 'smiling', 'bouncing', 'along', 'attired', 'mind-boggling', 'outrageous', 'outfits', 'brilliant', 'bold', 'colors', 'When', 'Poppy', 'bicycle', 'stolen', 'shrugs', 'off', 'driving', 'lessons', 'tutelage', 'acerbic', 'uptight', 'Scott', '[', 'Eddie', 'Marsan', ']', 'Both', 'individuals', 'are', 'poles', 'apart', 'driving', 'scenes', 'had', 'truly', 'hilarious', 'maddening', 'scenes', 'movie', 'en-ra-ha', 'en-ra-ha', 'Scott', 'vainly', 'get', 'Poppy', 'focused', 'driving', 'busy', 'looking', 'squirrels', 'wheel', ']', 'Sally', 'Hawkins', '[', 'who', 'was', 'amazing', 'BBC', 'period', 'drama', 'Persuasion', ']', 'credible', 'role', 'upbeat', 'happy', 'Poppy', '30', 'single', 'lived', 'female', 'flatmate', '[', 'who', 'also', 'BFF', ']', '10', 'years', 'okay', 'younger', 'married', 'pregnant', 'sister', 'remonstrations', 'get', ""'real"", 'life', ']', 'individual', 'utterly', 'ease', 'life', 'taking', 'flamenco', 'lessons', 'emotionally', 'distraught', 'dance', 'instructor', 'highlight', 'film', 'are', 'dance', 'lessons', 'emotional', 'outbursts', 'instructor', ']', 'Hawkins', 'convincing', '[', 'yes', 'annoying', ']', 'performance', 'be', 'something', 'darker', 'underneath', 'eternal', 'cheerfulness', 'upbeat', 'manner', 'masking', 'Polly', 'own', 'awkwardness', 'situations', 'just', 'got', 'sense', '[', 'perhaps', ""'m"", 'wrong', ']', 'over-cheerful', 'manner', 'was', ""n't"", 'natural.The', 'movie', 'also', 'choppy', 'storytelling', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'mesh-', 'series', 'different', 'stories', 'being', 'put', 'together', 'form', 'movie', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'comedy', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'credible', 'enough', 'almost', 'manic', 'driving', 'instructor', 'portrayed', 'Eddie', 'Marsan', 'was', 'especially', 'compelling', 'performance', 'spittle', ""'d"", 'have', 'given', '4*', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'almost', '2', 'hrs', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'editing']",Happy-Go-Lucky
