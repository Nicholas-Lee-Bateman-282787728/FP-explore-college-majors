I for one have enjoyed the many movies he made. He was so natural in his acting. Something I know he carried over into his public life as governor of California and then President of these United States. The movie is an interesting western like old western were first made. One does not discover until the very end that he is an agent working for the government. I give it five stars because of Ronald Reagan who for me one of the most successful actors in history. His movies span over 77 years. Then we have a young Barbara Stanwick who also enjoyed a very successful career in films. This film is a collector's item. You also receive a bonus with the movie Tennessee's Partner on the flip side. Ronald Reagan made hundreds of films. If you have considered starting a collection of his films then this would be a great choice! Enjoy the movie and collect a bit of movie history!,5,Cattle Queen of Montana Movie Review,1233187200,"01 29, 2009",2009,970,"['were', 'ever', 'fan', 'Late', 'President', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'then', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'one', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'movies', 'made', 'was', 'so', 'natural', 'acting', 'Something', 'know', 'carried', 'public', 'life', 'governor', 'California', 'then', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'movie', 'interesting', 'western', 'old', 'western', 'were', 'first', 'made', 'One', 'not', 'discover', 'very', 'end', 'agent', 'working', 'government', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'who', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'actors', 'history', 'movies', 'span', '77', 'years', 'Then', 'have', 'young', 'Barbara', 'Stanwick', 'who', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'successful', 'career', 'films', 'film', 'collector', 'item', 'also', 'receive', 'bonus', 'movie', 'Tennessee', 'Partner', 'flip', 'side', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'made', 'hundreds', 'films', 'have', 'considered', 'starting', 'collection', 'films', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'choice', 'Enjoy', 'movie', 'collect', 'bit', 'movie', 'history']",Cattle Queen of Montana & Tennessee's Partner: Western Double Feature
