There's nothing titilating about the nudity, nothing talented about the display of grotesquery, but rather a definitive feeling of asexuality, all designed to repulse and repel.You have to wonder what happened in this person's childhood to make him hate life and himself so much, to become this dirty, depraved being. It's like he was told he was a monster so often that he became one. This documentary does give a small amount of insight into the Allin brothers' childhood with a reclusive and insane father. The alcohol and drugs certainly helped fuel the depravity, but there was something else very ugly, provoking and bubbling underneath.The band itself plays competent hard rock and the drummer provides some entertaining interviews. And even though I found no redeeming human value in the ""performances"" or negative thought processes of G.G., the scenes from the live footage stay with you for days afterward, like a bad car wreck you can't get out of your mind.You must watch the extra footage of the last ""show"" the night before he was found dead of a heroin O.D., with about 100 'fans' following him down the streets of New York. Just the fact that he inspired any kind of adulation is a troubling puzzlement, but you can tell from this footage that the majority of his followers were either hardcore junkies or impressionable drunkards.

It talks about his plans for an onstage suicide on Halloween(which every year imprisonment prevented that from happening).  We also get the gross pleasure of watching GG poop on stage and then getting creative--I won't go into details, you'll have to see it to believe it.  There's plenty of other sick crazy stuff too.  Not for those with weak stomachs, obviously.GG Allin refused to be controlled by authority, trapped by typical human comforts, or harnessed by any common acceptable behaviors.

Was GG a real performance artist, or was he just a really demented, arrogant, vile piece of s***?  There's something utterly fascinating about the guy, watching him deliberately destroy himself in the name of rock and roll.  He goes on stage and is deliberately being an a**h**e.  He hits his fans (who love it for the most part), defecates on stage, pisses on stage, cuts himself, mutilates himself, does drugs, and indulges in coprography and bondage.  This film is under an hour, and doesn't really answer anything.  It just seems to want to shock you, and that it does.  GG Allin is so interesting that the film is watchable, but the direction of it is uninspired.  It moves like an MSNBC special on GG.  There's really nothing interesting about the filmmaking here.  Personally, I would have never wanted to hang out with GG, as I fear my life would be at stake, and I wouldn't want him vomitting on me or worse.  But I am interested in his story.

444559,A38KB16DRKI8QW,6305026009,High Duke,"[11, 21]","What makes this film truly iconic and amazing is how it exposes what an utter joke punk rock is.  Punk and it's attendant philosphy is nothing more than a lie foisted on desperate youth who can't fit in and then make a 'movement' out of their alienation.  Of course, they end up forming their own 'gangs' and cliques, with their own codes of conduct and rules of inclusion....pathetic.  G.G. Allin bought into that crap hook, line and sinker before turning on it and going full out and taking all his nihilism to its illogical extreme.  Hated is a great chronicle of how punks inherent self-absorption and dissillusionment with just about everything, culminate into vast amounts of hopeless nothingness.  Granted, G.G. doesn't represent your typical punk or hardcore kid, and many people are divided about the guy, but he took punk's 'lifestyle' and stylized  self-destructive impulses to the hilt.  You can practically see the guy yearning for a hug, except he probably smells way too bad for anyone to get too close.  This movie is great to put on at a party and to sit back and watch everyone get grossed out at the circus sideshow.  G.G. teetered on the brink of self-parody and always crossed the line into it.  It seems that he's always 'on', kinda like a punk rock Robin Williams.  I'll admit the movie is absolutely hilarious at times, particularly when G.G.'s confronting his audiences.  The scene where he's shoving bananas up his butt  at some spoken word gig at NYU is great, especially when he starts tossing banana chunks at people.  But you gotta ask yourself, what's the point?  Yeah, it's funny but so what?  I asked myself the same thing when I saw G.G. lay down at a BBQ and had some chick urinate in his mouth, which prompted him to upchuck his hot dogs.  Yay.  And the reasons for his psycho-social behaviour?  A lousy upbringing in New England, where G.G. overheard his father talking about killing his kids, his wife and himself....whoop-dee-doo.  Seeing how G.G. dressed like a girl in high school spoke of someone so desperate for attention, but also so full of self-loathing for wanting that attention, that he turned on everyone and everything.  Of course, one day G.G. discovers punk which gives him an outlet for his erratic behaviour and a cult following that gets off on his lunacy, intellectualizing it as some sort of statement about a screwed up society.  You can tell G.G. got off on being held in such high regard, even if it was for making an a** of himself.  Why else would the guy declare, for years mind you, that he would kill himself on stage on Halloween night?  Why not do it privately and with dignity?  Why have an audience?  And who's to say that the guy wouldn't take out a couple of his fans as well?  The strange thing is that G.G. wasn't a total buffoon and he could actually write some catchy and clever tunes, especially early on in his 'career'.  You can't really tell in the tunes he does with the Murder Junkies, mostly because the sound quality in the flick ain't so great, but songs like 'Bite It, You Scum' are really fun.  And the scene with G.G. strumming an acoustic guitar and singing Warren Zevon's 'Carmelita' is revealing. Was he really maybe a softie? Of course, for anyone who knows about him, G.G. will always be remembered as the guy who used to spread his own feces all over himself, the guy who'd bash his own teeth in with his microphone, the guy who'd cut himself and assualt his audience etc. etc.  Todd Phillips does a great job of letting G.G. and his assorted hangers-on hang themselves with their own rope.  While I don't care much for punk's philosophical standpoint, the music is pretty good.  This movie is the same.  I could care less about G.G. Allin, no matter how amusing I find his self-immolation to his lifestyle choice, but this movie is really well done and ALWAYS interesting.  There's never a dull moment.  G.G.'s demise, a typical heroin overdose like the dumb rock star he is, is anticlimactic and much like his life.  A lot of bark, with only a little bite...enough to nip at your heels and annoy you, but nothing that has any REAL effect.  Enjoy this in a room full of people who can't imagine a guy like this would exist and watch their jaws drop.

444560,A2VF79Z6SDBIAS,6305026009,"ifutureman ""ifutureman""","[3, 5]","During the opening credits of this incredible documentary, the utter vileness and insanity of GG Allin is quickly laid bare: the camera rolls while GG lies onstage, a naked woman crouched above him, and he removes a hot dog from her anus and begins sucking on it.And that about sums up the tone of this film.  Violence and degradation in equal measure were the essence of GG Allin, and as awful as his music was, we're all probably very lucky he managed to channel so much of his psychopathic rage into his performances.  After watching ""Hated"" it's hard not to believe that, as he often suggested, if not for his ""rock and roll"" he might well have been a rapist or serial killer.GG started out as a relatively normal punk rocker in the late 70's, but throughout the 1980's he became increasingly unhinged.  Ingestion of large quantities of alcohol and whatever drugs he could find no doubt fueled his growing paranoia and megalomania; by the time of this documentary, GG had become completely convinced that he was ""God, Jesus and Satan all rolled into one"" - though it is difficult to find any examples of the first two in GG's behavior, lyrics or world view.  The man was apparently incapable of any level of empathy or compassion, preferring instead to either beat or be beaten.The most startling thing about GG, and which ""Hated"" does a good job of portraying, was his enthusiasm for both receiving and dispensing violence and humiliation.  In blunt terms, he was as willing to be hit/cut/burned/sh&t; upon as he was willing to do those things to others. Often, he would simply mutilate himself.  Without flinching, Todd Phillips managed to keep the camera rolling through all of it.This is certainly the most disgusting video I own.  And I don't usually go for scenes of degradation or mindless violence.  Yet I can't deny the morbid appeal of this freak show.  And almost as intriguing as GG himself are his bandmates and fans - an assortment of outcasts and weirdos who somehow saw (and smelled) past the surface of this maniac.The bonus footage from the Gas Station (GG's last show, the day before he died) is the single strangest video I ever saw.  The band rehearses, then plays 1 1/2 songs before the power goes out, at which point GG goes completely nuts: breaking windows (buck naked of course) and getting bloody; fighting various crowd members; taking a dump and rubbing it all over himself; storming out to the NYC sidewalk in broad daylight covered in blood and feces, somehow eluding the police who responded to the scene while some of his fans began rioting; and walking for several blocks through Greenwich Village with a couple of creepy hangers-on, repeatedly talking about how he wants to score some heroin and get high; and finally getting into a taxi.  My favorite moment is when he runs into some biker outside a bar and after chatting briefly, the biker jovially sends him on his way with an entirely sincere-sounding ""God bless, man!""Within 12 hours, GG would be dead of an overdose.This video is just downright bizarre.

And that is just what G.G. Allin's problem is. He does not try to express himself with words like any animal who can speak would do, or to express himself clearly like any human with some sense would do. He uses nearly exclusively body language and in that body language only one side of the picture, the gross and the gore, the dirty and the bloody. Punk they say? Punk they have the right to say. But G.G. Allin demonstrates if it is necessary to do so that he, as a punk rocker with a death wish, is an exhibitionist, an aggressive and violent person, a literal s***t-eater, a true p***s-drinker and a self p***e-taster. So what! So nothing. So not much. The death wish is no longer only a death wish in him. It is also a death instinct because he not only wishes death but he is cruelly violent against other people. If he really believes a body is a rock and roll temple, his vision of the temple is particularly dilapidated. It is Stonehenge after a gang of looters armed with twenty bulldozers have been on the site for a fortnight. Look at his temple, at his body: out of shape due to no exercise, extreme alcoholism, drug addiction of all types and kinds, not to speak of his idea that the body is like paper, to be scribbled on I guess. There is no explanation in this very superficial film. And there is no real presentation of his music. It is more some kind of self-satisfying review of this annihilating and nihilistic anti-art attitude on what is not even a stage, but just a piece of floor in some kind of back room. Punk for sure but without the music or without the political anarchism. Just some scatological provocation as if a provocation was enough to be considered as art in the simple fact that it is a provocation or as politics in the simple fact that is outside all norms. Too bad, and what's more he did not even hold his promise to commit suicide on stage. He simply died of an overdose. What a flop! What a let down!

Allin, but I've heard about his infamous stage antics which have pretty much overshadowed the fact that this man even had somewhat of a musical career. This documentary, by director Todd Phillips (you may know him as the director of films like Old School and The Hangover) gets up close (but not exactly personal) with the legend that was G.G. Allin.The documentary opens with a quote by John Wayne Gacy, the notorious serial killer who got to know Allin through prison visitations. Other people interviewed include some fans of Allin, Allin's brother/bass player Merle Allin (who sports a strangely menacing, ridiculous Hitler-like moustache), and a former member of Allin's band who had no respect or admiration for what Allin was doing on stage. The documentary shows Allin on-stage at various venues, as well as a spoken-word performance where Allin attacked a woman. That's hardly the worst thing you'll see Allin do in this doc and, with that said, be aware: this is a graphic, disgusting documentary. There is full-frontal nudity from both genders, consummation of bodily waste, images of self-mutilation, etc.Little seems to be known about the true character of G.G. Allin and this film does little to enlighten us, but I don't quite consider that a fault. I don't think anyone, let alone Allin, had a concept of who he was. Being neither a fan nor a hater, I was entranced by this documentary but I'm still unable to come to a conclusion about G.G. Allin. Was he an insane, vile human being (as many think) or a symbol of the animalistic nature that exists in all humans? People seem to be drawn on this as I am, but I find it hard to deny Allin had some mental issues. Maybe Allin (and others) saw his antics as representing something important, but how do you justify eating your own feces in front of an audience? Not just that, but smearing it on yourself and throwing it into the crowd?Anyone hoping to understand Allin will have to continue looking in vain, but this short documentary does serve as a visual presentation of one of the craziest, most violent musicians who ever lived. If you're a fan or just curious about this infamous character, this is worth your time.GRADE: B",4,"A Morbidly Fascinating, Short Documentary",1257379200,"11 5, 2009",2009,2237,"['have', 'never', 'listened', 'music', 'G.G', 'Allin', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'infamous', 'stage', 'antics', 'have', 'pretty', 'much', 'fact', 'man', 'even', 'had', 'somewhat', 'musical', 'career', 'documentary', 'director', 'Todd', 'Phillips', 'may', 'know', 'director', 'films', 'Old', 'School', 'Hangover', 'up', 'close', 'not', 'exactly', 'personal', 'legend', 'was', 'G.G', 'Allin.The', 'documentary', 'opens', 'quote', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Gacy', 'notorious', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'got', 'know', 'Allin', 'prison', 'visitations', 'Other', 'people', 'interviewed', 'include', 'fans', 'Allin', 'Allin', 'brother/bass', 'player', 'Merle', 'Allin', 'who', 'sports', 'strangely', 'menacing', 'ridiculous', 'Hitler-like', 'moustache', 'former', 'member', 'Allin', 'band', 'who', 'had', 'respect', 'admiration', 'what', 'Allin', 'was', 'doing', 'stage', 'documentary', 'Allin', 'on-stage', 'various', 'venues', 'as', 'well', 'spoken-word', 'performance', 'where', 'Allin', 'attacked', 'woman', 'hardly', 'worst', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Allin', 'do', 'doc', 'said', 'be', 'aware', 'graphic', 'disgusting', 'documentary', 'full-frontal', 'nudity', 'genders', 'consummation', 'bodily', 'waste', 'images', 'self-mutilation', 'etc.Little', 'be', 'known', 'true', 'character', 'G.G', 'Allin', 'film', 'little', 'enlighten', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'consider', 'fault', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'let', 'alone', 'Allin', 'had', 'concept', 'who', 'was', 'Being', 'fan', 'hater', 'was', 'entranced', 'documentary', ""'m"", 'still', 'unable', 'come', 'conclusion', 'G.G', 'Allin', 'Was', 'insane', 'vile', 'human', 'being', 'many', 'think', 'symbol', 'animalistic', 'nature', 'humans', 'People', 'seem', 'be', 'drawn', 'am', 'find', 'hard', 'deny', 'Allin', 'had', 'mental', 'issues', 'Maybe', 'Allin', 'others', 'saw', 'antics', 'representing', 'something', 'important', 'how', 'do', 'justify', 'eating', 'own', 'feces', 'front', 'audience', 'Not', 'just', 'smearing', 'throwing', 'crowd', 'Anyone', 'hoping', 'understand', 'Allin', 'will', 'have', 'continue', 'looking', 'vain', 'short', 'documentary', 'serve', 'visual', 'presentation', 'one', 'craziest', 'most', 'violent', 'musicians', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', ""'re"", 'fan', 'just', 'curious', 'infamous', 'character', 'worth', 'time.GRADE', 'B']",N/A
444565,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,6305026009,K. Driscoll,"[2, 2]","Todd Phillips is kind of a big deal in American comedy films these days.  He has played a role in writing and directing such films asThe Hangover,Old School, andRoad Trip.  All three films are arguably modern comedy classics.  His 1994 documentary, made five years before his next film, is low-budget, disturbing, short, dirty, grainy, and sort of pasted together.  As a film it is like getting punched in the face.  This all seems kind of fitting as it is a movie about punk rock icon G.G. Allin and if ever there was a documentary that should be praised solely on the choice of its subject matter then it is this documentary titled Hated:  G.G. Allin and the Murder Junkies.G.G. Allin is an underground punk rock performer whose performances were so chaotic they drew a choice few fans that were present for the intensity of the show.  When I say intensity I'm not talking about crashing guitars and flashing lights, I'm talking about the threat of physical violence occurring at any moment.  G.G. Allin often performed nude.  He would drop from the stage while punching and kicking people in the crowd violently.  He would hit himself in the face with his microphone until he bled profusely and he'd cover his body in his blood.  He would sexually assault women in the audience and strongly encouraged his fans to do the same.  He would request that women urinate in his mouth and would often urinate and/or defecate during his performances.  If he defecated he would often cover his body with his excrement and even consume it or throw it onto his fans.  He was arrested over fifty times for crimes he committed during his performances and even served two years in a Michigan prison.  G.G. Allin was a primal uncontrollable and completely unbound force.  In terms of shock rock or being unconventional and anti-authority, anyone else in a business of that ilk is partaking in child's play by comparison.  Take him or leave him, G.G. Allin was the real deal.G.G. Allin's fans were like rabid but loyal dogs and toward the end of G.G.'s life he made appearances on television unapologetically explaining his actions, even justifying them and declaring himself to be some kind of deity.  He tapped into a culture obviously ignored by society and became their outspoken and attention-getting overlord.  After I watched this documentary I couldn't look away from G.G. anymore.  I needed to find out more about him.  I'll fully admit that my fascination is not motivated by anything other than fear and general discomfort.  Most will not want to be fascinated and it might be best for you to have never heard of G.G. Allin at all.  He died in 1993 at the age of 36 from a drug overdose after a show that ended with near rioting in the streets.  I'm sure many who read the papers about his many rampages, or saw him on Geraldo and Jerry Springer, drew a collective sigh of relief when they heard of his demise.  But there was a human there somewhere, perhaps a civilized one that stripped off those pretenses with his clothes before his first few performances.  A human that intentionally reminded us that we are hardly more than flatulent soft-skinned primates.  Perhaps that is the scariest truth of all.  I recommend checking this out but remember that Phillips' film doesn't look away and the footage is graphic.  It simply wouldn't be covering its subject if it wasn't.",4,Hated for His Revenge on This Robotic Society,1294185600,"01 5, 2011",2011,3371,"['Todd', 'Phillips', 'kind', 'big', 'deal', 'American', 'comedy', 'films', 'days', 'played', 'role', 'writing', 'directing', 'such', 'films', 'asThe', 'Hangover', 'Old', 'School', 'andRoad', 'Trip', 'three', 'films', 'are', 'arguably', 'modern', 'comedy', 'classics', '1994', 'documentary', 'made', 'five', 'years', 'next', 'film', 'low-budget', 'disturbing', 'short', 'dirty', 'grainy', 'sort', 'pasted', 'together', 'film', 'getting', 'punched', 'face', 'kind', 'fitting', 'movie', 'punk', 'rock', 'icon', 'G.G', 'Allin', 'ever', 'was', 'documentary', 'should', 'be', 'praised', 'solely', 'choice', 'subject', 'matter', 'then', 'documentary', 'titled', 'Hated', 'G.G', 'Allin', 'Murder', 'Junkies.G.G', 'Allin', 'underground', 'punk', 'rock', 'performer', 'performances', 'were', 'so', 'chaotic', 'drew', 'choice', 'few', 'fans', 'were', 'present', 'intensity', 'show', 'When', 'say', 'intensity', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'crashing', 'guitars', 'flashing', 'lights', ""'m"", 'talking', 'threat', 'physical', 'violence', 'occurring', 'moment', 'G.G', 'Allin', 'often', 'performed', 'nude', 'would', 'drop', 'stage', 'punching', 'kicking', 'people', 'crowd', 'violently', 'would', 'hit', 'face', 'microphone', 'bled', 'profusely', ""'d"", 'cover', 'body', 'blood', 'would', 'sexually', 'assault', 'women', 'audience', 'strongly', 'encouraged', 'fans', 'do', 'same', 'would', 'request', 'women', 'urinate', 'mouth', 'would', 'often', 'urinate', 'and/or', 'defecate', 'performances', 'defecated', 'would', 'often', 'cover', 'body', 'excrement', 'even', 'consume', 'throw', 'fans', 'was', 'arrested', 'fifty', 'times', 'crimes', 'committed', 'performances', 'even', 'served', 'two', 'years', 'Michigan', 'prison', 'G.G', 'Allin', 'was', 'primal', 'uncontrollable', 'completely', 'unbound', 'force', 'terms', 'shock', 'rock', 'being', 'unconventional', 'anti-authority', 'anyone', 'else', 'business', 'ilk', 'partaking', 'child', 'play', 'comparison', 'Take', 'leave', 'G.G', 'Allin', 'was', 'real', 'deal.G.G', 'Allin', 'fans', 'were', 'like', 'rabid', 'loyal', 'dogs', 'end', 'G.G', 'life', 'made', 'appearances', 'television', 'unapologetically', 'explaining', 'actions', 'even', 'justifying', 'declaring', 'be', 'kind', 'deity', 'tapped', 'culture', 'obviously', 'ignored', 'society', 'became', 'outspoken', 'attention-getting', 'overlord', 'watched', 'documentary', 'could', ""n't"", 'look', 'away', 'G.G', 'anymore', 'needed', 'find', 'out', 'more', ""'ll"", 'fully', 'admit', 'fascination', 'not', 'motivated', 'anything', 'other', 'fear', 'general', 'discomfort', 'Most', 'will', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'fascinated', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'G.G', 'Allin', 'died', '1993', 'age', '36', 'drug', 'overdose', 'show', 'ended', 'near', 'rioting', 'streets', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'who', 'read', 'papers', 'many', 'rampages', 'saw', 'Geraldo', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'drew', 'collective', 'sigh', 'relief', 'when', 'heard', 'demise', 'was', 'human', 'somewhere', 'perhaps', 'civilized', 'one', 'stripped', 'off', 'pretenses', 'clothes', 'first', 'few', 'performances', 'human', 'intentionally', 'reminded', 'are', 'hardly', 'more', 'flatulent', 'soft-skinned', 'primates', 'Perhaps', 'scariest', 'truth', 'recommend', 'checking', 'out', 'remember', 'Phillips', 'film', ""n't"", 'look', 'away', 'footage', 'graphic', 'simply', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'covering', 'subject', 'was', ""n't""]",N/A

G.G. Allin's antics certainly did make him Hated by mainstream society.However, this documentary also shows much of G.G. offstage. Given his onstage act, who would have known G.G. was a loving father to adorably cute twin girls and would read Curious George and the Man with The Yellow Hat to them every night no matter how many times they already heard it? He also gave a significant portion of the profits from ""Freaks, Faggots, Drunks & Junkies"" to shelters for abused and neglected teens.G.G. also noted Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton as inspirations for his stage act.In regards to his stage act, G.G. shows conflict and remorse about his extreme antics when he describes waiting to meet Bob Keeshan (TV's Captain Kangaroo) at a Border's Book Store event and being admonished by Bob Keeshan that his reputation was an inappropriate role model for kids and young adults and that he would not sign any products for G.G. and requested G.G.'s removal from the premises.This encounter really convicted G.G. and made him question his future as the shock punk king.

444570,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6305026009,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[61, 67]","Hated: G. G. Allin and the Murder Junkies (Todd Phillips, 1993)What on god's green earth has happened to Todd Phillips in the ten years since he released Hated, the definitive G. G. Allin documentary? How, exactly, can one go from covering a dangerous, violent punk icon to doing a documentary about Phish and making really, really bad Tom Green/Wilson Brothers movies (Road Trip, Old School, Starsky and Hutch)? I don't know, but if you find yourself crawling under the table every time someone even mentions the name Todd Phillips, taking a look at Hated may convince you that there really are the underpinnings of a good documentary filmmaker beneath the present idiocy. Or maybe not. Much of that may depend on your view of his subject, a man on whom no one who's ever encountered his work can be without an opinion.For the ten or twenty people who still haven't heard of him, G. G. Allin was, as Murder Junkies drummer Dino says, ""God, Jesus, and Satan all rolled into one,"" perhaps the last American rock and roll singer who grasped what the spirit of rock was about, and aimed to bring that spirit back to music. To that effect, Allin would today be called a ""performance artist"" rather than a rock band frontman, probably. Allin and co.'s now-legendary gigs, three aborted tours' worth (as brother Merle Allin says, ""you never plan on finishing a tour-- two reasons: the hospital or the law.""), usually started out looking like punk shows, but ended (long before they should have) in fights, riots, raids by the police, overdoses, what have you. Allin's notoriety increased a thousandfold when the talk show circuit picked him up in the early nineties (some of the footage from his appearance on Geraldo is shown here), and as Phillips, who had been making Hated off and on since 1988, got ready to put the finishing touches on the film, Allin had gone from underground icon to public animal number one. The band kicked off the Terror in America tour in 1993, with much of the interview footage with the band members coming just before or just after the start of the tour. Allin was dead within days of the completion of the film, of which Phillips then halted postproduction to add another ten minutes of footage to the end.Phillips is obviously influenced by the Errol Morris school of documentary filmmaking: just sit back with the camera and let those you're interviewing make complete fools of themselves. But there's more to Phillips than that; he fades into the background at times, but there's never the sense that the subjects of the documentary forget the filmmaker is there. (Phillips has confirmed, in interviews, that this never happened.) Not surprising when you consider that Allin's modus operandi, more often than not, was to attack the audience; the filmmaker is part of the audience, therefore...The documentary itself is interesting enough, and refuses to paint Allin as either saint or sinner (surprising for a filmmaker who'd been in contact with Allin for five years), letting the viewer make his own judgments on that score. And viewers should, without doubt, though the pervasive language and nudity (both Allin himself and drummer Dino often performed naked or nearly so), strong sexual content, and what I can only describe as adult situations (despite the infantile nature of same) is likely to put the vast majority of viewers off ever renting this. But the real value in the DVD release, and the most ironic portion of it, is fifty minutes of extra footage recorded on the last day of Allin's life. The footage shows the soundcheck and aborted (halfway through the second song) legendary set at New York club The Gas Station, often considered the most violent set the band ever played (it has been reported numerous times that over a hundred attendees rioted after the show was shut down), and about thirty minutes of Allin's antics with Dino and a core group of fans afterwards while they went on a quest for heroin. What emerges in this footage is a picture of G. G. Allin that, while not diametrically opposed to the stage presence and the person that emerges from interviews, is certainly a different, and fascinating, side of Allin's character. In the documentary, Allin is characterized by almost everyone as a complete misanthrope, a person who would just as soon kill you as look at you. The footage of Allin wandering (naked, at the beginning of the trek) around the streets of New York City with eight to ten others and twenty or thirty following at a distance shows a smiling, affable guy who's usually got his arms draped around one or two people, haranguing police but never turning nasty about it, acknowledging fans with smiles and victory signs (yes, there are two fingers raised there), and generally being anything but dangerous-looking, as long as you look past the fact that he's covered in filth and (his own) blood. The end effect is to raise a whole lot of questions about a person for whom society assumed it already had all the answers. The documentary itself is capable; releasing the final footage with it is brilliant. ****",4,Todd Phillips really CAN make a good movie!,1060560000,"08 11, 2003",2003,5089,"['Hated', 'G.', 'G.',

The story he read from was about a punk rocker that was set to come to the area named GG Allin. The paper had a list of some of the things he is known for like throwing faeces from the stage at the crown, to planning to kill himself one day onstage although the date was pushed back a few times. I remember thinking that the man who was called Public Animal #1 was just an act and no one was that nuts. So about a year or so later at a local video store I found a copy of Hated and my curious nature got me to plunk down twenty bucks for this film. The film opens with the director Todd Phillips discribing the first GG Allin show he ever attended. Then the screen blacks and then we see a man standing naked on the stage and smashing himself in the face with his microphone. The movie just get's stranger and sicker from there. In the movie (a documantary really) we try to get into the mind of Allin. Phillips talks to everyone from friends, bandmates, to an old high school teacher. We get to see Allin in all his depaved glory as he preforms on stage and grosses out anyone watching, attacks a women at a spoken word after reading from the same story that I first heard him in, to calling from prison. The people around Allin are at times just as strange. The brother Merill, is also GG's bass player. He is, like GG, covered in tatoos and has a large Hitler like mustache but he is the most sane of some of the ones we meet. There is Dino the naked drummer. He plays the drums naked and is infatuated by a all girl punk group named The Lunar Chicks. When this nut case speaks it's a real job just to try and follow what he's saying. Then there is Unk. That it just Unk. Unk is a real fool of epic proportions. He is really somthing to see. Whatever he says about liking to live though GG Allin or asking the director to edit out a womens name (Phillips leaves the name in there) who went to GG's birthday party and does the must disgusting thing. As a documentory it's not bad but the footage and the movie at time's are just to gross to even watch. This man was all that they say he was. Never has sickness and maniacal behavior been so front and center as with this film. GG Allin whould die of a herion overdose in 1993, somthing that you see coming in the movie while GG is destroying the song Carmillita by Warren Zevon he has a needle on his headstock like some preformers have a smoke. The one positive I will say is that after all is said about Allin there is a few things that can't be taken from him. No one had ever done the kind of things he did and he was no phoney.In a time where Marilyn Manson tries to scare you and make believe he is somthing he is not there was none of that in Allin. He acted crazy becouse he was crazy....I must warn you that if this review has not detoured you from watching this movie let me just say that Hated shows very sick acts and very sick things.

I put him first becouse dispite his apperance he is the most normal of the group.2. Then there is Dino the naked drummer. He is infatuated by an all girl group called The Lunar Chicks. He also is whacked out of his skull when they speak with him.3. Then there is Unk. That is his name, Unk. This piece of work is really funny, even if it is unintentional. He tells about the birthday party, asking the director to edit somthing out that he leaves in the final cut, how much he loves GG and just make a fool out of himself.GG Allin died in 1993 of a herion overdose. Not a surprise becouse when we see him in the movie playing an acustic gutiar, and destroying the Warren Zevon song Carmilita, he has a needle in the head stock.Quite a bit has been made of the fact that GG Allin was the real thing and there was no fake in him. Well for that they are right. He did not just act nuts, he was. In a time of Mayilyn Manson we may even see Allin as a breath a freash air, but you can't. I have seen people bring there kids to Manson's show becouse they know he is a phoney. No parent ever brought there kid to see GG Allin.GG Allin did not make good on his promise to kill himself on stage but he did do one thing. He will forever be known as the best of the worst and whether you think that's a good thing is open to interpritation.After watching this movie it's hard to think about anything else. I have never seen a more dispicable person as with GG Allin. He is a racist,offender of all the senses,dusturbed,twisted,sick, and just plain crazy. I am a fan of anything that shakes up the group, even if it get's me as well, but this person and this film bothers even the most hardcore person.Hated does serve one purpose however and that is we get to see into the life of the worlds most well known punk sickness, and you only have to stop the tape at anytime. He was an interesting person to say the least and in the end he died as he lived. Alone,covered in filth,and sad. His story is not one of great sadness but you do feel sad after seeing it. I think it's becouse we want very badly to think these people are just hype, and some are not. GG Allin in the end hated everyone. There was only a few people that he allowed even close to him but I think that no one knew him. This movie is a look into the life of rock's stangest and most pitifull case.",2,This man had problems.....,1016928000,"03 24, 2002",2002,3698,"['found', 'tape', 'Hated', 'local', 'store', 'decided', 'was', 'worth', 'look', 'was', 'first', 'mistake', 'next', 'was', 'watching', 'be', 'fair', 'even', 'had', 'read', 'back', 'note', 'cover', 'was', 'man', 'standing', 'mostly', 'naked', 'blood', 'head', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'oh', 'well', 'movie', 'documentory', 'GG', 'Allin', 'best', 'know', 'being', 'worst', 'worst', 'Relevieving', 'stage', 'claim', 'would', 'one', 'day', 'commit', 'suicide', 'stage', 'movie', 'open', 'narrator', 'telling', 'first', 'GG', 'Allin', 'concert', 'saw', 'Then', 'movie', 'GG', 'stage', 'naked', 'slamming', 'face', 'microphone', 'just', 'get', 'stranger', 'movie', 'GG', 'sick', 'glory', 'see', 'stage', 'doing', 'what', 'talked', 'about', 'man', 'was', 'not', 'hype', 'see', 'attack', 'women', 'spoken', 'word', 'show', 'where', 'reading', 'same', 'Boston', 'paper', 'first', 'heard', 'do', 'grossest', 'thing', 'birthday', 'party', 'get', 'thrown', 'collage', 'show', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'wont', 'go', 'into.People', 'have', 'called', 'movie', 'funny', 'smart', 'what', 'not', 'found', 'more', 'disturbing', 'sad.However', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'movie', 'rest', 'cast', 'up', 'lack', 'humor', 'just', 'being', 'there.1', 'Merill', 'brother', 'bass', 'player', 'put', 'first', 'dispite', 'apperance', 'most', 'normal', 'group.2', 'Then', 'Dino', 'naked', 'drummer', 'infatuated', 'girl', 'group', 'called', 'Lunar', 'Chicks', 'also', 'whacked', 'skull', 'when', 'speak', 'him.3', 'Then', 'Unk', 'name', 'Unk', 'piece', 'work', 'really', 'funny', 'even', 'unintentional', 'birthday', 'party', 'asking', 'director', 'edit', 'somthing', 'out', 'final', 'cut', 'how', 'much', 'GG', 'just', 'make', 'fool', 'himself.GG', 'Allin', 'died', '1993', 'herion', 'overdose', 'Not', 'surprise', 'becouse', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'playing', 'acustic', 'gutiar', 'destroying', 'Warren', 'Zevon', 'song', 'Carmilita', 'needle', 'head', 'stock.Quite', 'bit', 'been', 'made', 'fact', 'GG', 'Allin', 'was', 'real', 'thing', 'was', 'fake', 'Well', 'are', 'right', 'did', 'not', 'just', 'act', 'nuts', 'was', 'time', 'Mayilyn', 'Manson', 'may', 'even', 'see', 'Allin', 'breath', 'freash', 'air', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'seen', 'people', 'bring', 'there', 'kids', 'Manson', 'show', 'know', 'phoney', 'parent', 'ever', 'brought', 'there', 'kid', 'see', 'GG', 'Allin.GG', 'Allin', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'promise', 'kill', 'stage', 'did', 'do', 'one', 'thing', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'known', 'best', 'worst', 'think', 'good', 'thing', 'open', 'interpritation.After', 'watching', 'movie', 'hard', 'think', 'anything', 'else', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'more', 'dispicable', 'person', 'GG', 'Allin', 'racist', 'offender', 'senses', 'dusturbed', 'twisted', 'sick', 'just', 'plain', 'crazy', 'am', 'fan', 'anything', 'up', 'group', 'even', 'get', 'well', 'person', 'film', 'bothers', 'even', 'most', 'hardcore', 'person.Hated', 'serve', 'one', 'purpose', 'however', 'get', 'see', 'life', 'worlds', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'punk', 'sickness', 'only', 'have', 'stop', 'tape', 'anytime', 'was', 'interesting', 'person', 'say', 'least', 'end', 'died', 'lived', 'Alone', 'covered', 'filth', 'sad', 'story', 'not', 'one', 'great', 'sadness', 'do', 'feel', 'sad', 'seeing', 'think', 'want', 'very', 'badly', 'think', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'hype', 'are', 'not', 'GG', 'Allin', 'end', 'hated', 'everyone', 'was', 'only', 'few', 'people', 'allowed', 'even', 'close', 'think', 'one', 'knew', 'movie', 'look', 'life', 'rock', 'stangest', 'most', 'pitifull', 'case']",N/A
444574,AEPVPNXQ1DC6A,6305026009,"scott c ""scottc23""","[5, 7]","I recall thinking to myself after watching Hated - did I just watch a brutally honest man who embodies all that is the punk rock ethos or did I just watch a psychopath at work?  I still don't know yet I can't help but find myself steeped in respect for this man.  He refused to accept the life on life's terms.  He lived on his terms more than anyone I can think of.  Did he shock for the sake of shock?  Absolutely not.  He was shocking because he was who he was and would not give in to anyone or anything.  Allin seems to be the combination of every shred of anger and rebellion from every artist that ever tried to break the mold.  When others put down their pens, paints, guitars and typewriters, Allin kept screaming.Think about it.  Almost every one of us has compromised to keep a job, a woman, a man, a family, a house, car, whatever.  We need to pay the rent, the bills, eat and get to work so we don't end up living beneath a freeway.  Allin didn't care.  He told everyone to eat sh** and he was more than happy to sit in a jail cell if need be.  In some strange way, this apparent lunatic transcended life itself where everything was equal and nothing mattered.  Not life, jail or death.  But he was no lunatic.  He was a bright man who had huge balls and was never hesitant to tell anyone exactly what he thought.  Because the consequences were meaningless.  If you can live your life where consequences mean nothing, I really think, dead or alive, you've won.Overall, Hated is a good film.  The 50 minutes in the extras can be tough to watch because of the handheld camera bouncing all over the place.  This is one of the few things I've seen where I was not only asking myself, ""Who is this guy?"" but ""Who the hell am I?""  I still don't know if I think GG Allin is repulsive or inspiring but the fact I'm torn tells me he was one hell of a man.",4,A life without consequence,1184716800,"07 18, 2007",2007,1859,"['recall', 'thinking', 'myself', 'watching', 'Hated', 'did', 'just', 'watch', 'brutally', 'honest', 'man', 'who', 'punk', 'rock', 'ethos', 'did', 'just', 'watch', 'psychopath', 'work', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'find', 'steeped', 'respect', 'man', 'refused', 'accept', 'life', 'life', 'terms', 'lived', 'terms', 'more', 'anyone', 'can', 'think', 'Did', 'shock', 'sake', 'shock', 'Absolutely', 'not', 'was', 'shocking', 'was', 'who', 'was', 'would', 'not', 'give', 'anyone', 'anything', 'Allin', 'be', 'combination', 'shred', 'anger', 'rebellion', 'artist', 'ever', 'tried', 'break', 'mold', 'When', 'others', 'put', 'down', 'pens', 'paints', 'guitars', 'typewriters', 'Allin', 'kept', 'screaming.Think', 'one', 'compromised', 'keep', 'job', 'woman', 'man', 'family', 'house', 'car', 'need', 'pay', 'rent', 'bills', 'eat', 'get', 'work', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'living', 'freeway', 'Allin', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'told', 'everyone', 'eat', 'sh**', 'was', 'more', 'happy', 'sit', 'jail', 'cell', 'need', 'be', 'strange', 'way', 'apparent', 'lunatic', 'transcended', 'life', 'where', 'everything', 'was', 'equal', 'nothing', 'mattered', 'Not', 'life', 'jail', 'death', 'was', 'lunatic', 'was', 'bright', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'huge', 'balls', 'was', 'never', 'hesitant', 'tell', 'anyone', 'exactly', 'what', 'thought', 'consequences', 'were', 'meaningless', 'can', 'live', 'life', 'where', 'consequences', 'mean', 'nothing', 'really', 'think', 'dead', 'alive', ""'ve"", 'won.Overall', 'Hated', 'good', 'film', '50', 'minutes', 'extras', 'can', 'be', 'tough', 'watch', 'handheld', 'camera', 'bouncing', 'place', 'one', 'few', 'things', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'where', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'asking', 'Who', 'guy', 'Who', 'hell', 'am', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'think', 'GG', 'Allin', 'repulsive', 'inspiring', 'fact', ""'m"", 'torn', 'tells', 'was', 'one', 'hell', 'man']",N/A

GG allin is perhaps the most notorious figure in punk history.  while ian mackaye was preaching straight edge and jello biafra was ranting about the police, GG was busy eating his own waste and beating up his fans.  this documentary, as disturbing as it is oddly touching and funny, follows him and will show you sides of his life that you would've never seen and sides of his life you don't nessescarily want to see.the music itself wasn't all that substantial, mostly consisting of guitar work that sounded like it was recorded in a shed and lyrics that consisted of a few obscenities strung together in a semiincoherent manner.  he had no home and barely any clothing, hated everyone and everything, and almost never ended a show without getting arrested or starting a riot.not only do we get a glimpse into GG's past but we can also see GG on the road doing what he was famous for.  words cannot do justice for what happens here.  the shows themselves are disturbing and all have a color routine that consists of GG's naked flesh (eventually becoming splattered with blood), the dark musty surrounding of whatever club they're in, and the all too recognizable splatter of whatever bodily fluid was being thrown on the audience that night.GG allin is and was a very unsettling person.  he is perhaps most famous for the stunt he had planned for halloween in which he was to kill himself on stage and take as many people with him as he could.  he wound up dying of a drug overdose after a show at the gas station that lasted but ten minutes, which was ample time for GG to wow the crowd with acts that took exhibitionisim and and stage excess to new heights.  he truly lived by his own rules and, if he was still alive today, would probably be serving a prison sentence.this documentary is among the best ever made, busting through taboos and the unexplored to give us a raw look at what would've probably just remained an urban legend.
