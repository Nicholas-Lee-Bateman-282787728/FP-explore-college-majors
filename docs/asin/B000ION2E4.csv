1021781,AMDWL7KIPD5G2,B000ION2E4,Dan Dean,"[0, 0]","I loved Planet Earth, and consider it one of the best films for nature/wildlife. This three-part series did the same for me with nature/geography. I had no problem with the narrator at all, but I can see where geography wouldn't keep some people awake as easily as exotic animals might. Amazing Planet is an amazing investigation of lava, magma, seas, and the power of wind, water and ice. I learned about our planet on many levels I wasn't aware of before, and I think its important for others to grasp it as well- especially in the wake of the Ken Ham and Bill Nye Creationist debate a few weeks ago. When you take in this whole picture, you will likely understand the world and science's ability to decipher it much more clearly than you did before.Perhaps it boils down to a matter of taste. I have not seen other documentaries focused on geography, that are this beautifully crafted. The three episodes covered the array of forces that continue to systematically mold our planet, with beautiful footage that kept me glued from beginning to end, with no critiques. If you know of a film that more superiorly covers this subject matter, than please leave a comment for me. I will thoroughly enjoy checking that one out as well!",5,I'm shocked at the low ratings this one is getting...,1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,1230,"['loved', 'Planet', 'Earth', 'consider', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'nature/wildlife', 'three-part', 'series', 'did', 'same', 'nature/geography', 'had', 'problem', 'narrator', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'geography', 'would', ""n't"", 'keep', 'people', 'awake', 'as', 'easily', 'exotic', 'animals', 'might', 'Amazing', 'Planet', 'amazing', 'investigation', 'lava', 'magma', 'seas', 'power', 'wind', 'water', 'ice', 'learned', 'planet', 'many', 'levels', 'was', ""n't"", 'aware', 'before', 'think', 'important', 'others', 'grasp', 'well-', 'especially', 'wake', 'Ken', 'Ham', 'Bill', 'Nye', 'Creationist', 'debate', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'When', 'take', 'whole', 'picture', 'will', 'likely', 'understand', 'world', 'science', 'ability', 'decipher', 'much', 'more', 'clearly', 'did', 'before.Perhaps', 'down', 'matter', 'taste', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'other', 'documentaries', 'focused', 'geography', 'are', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'three', 'episodes', 'covered', 'array', 'forces', 'continue', 'systematically', 'mold', 'planet', 'beautiful', 'footage', 'kept', 'glued', 'beginning', 'end', 'critiques', 'know', 'film', 'more', 'superiorly', 'covers', 'subject', 'matter', 'please', 'leave', 'comment', 'will', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'checking', 'one', 'out', 'as', 'well']",National Geographic - Amazing Planet

1021783,A2BFNWTI57900U,B000ION2E4,"D. E. Hill ""follower of the art of Natural Hi...","[3, 5]","The subject matter is very interesting, and most of the video clips are great in terms of resolution.  With four programs, this is a good value.  The dialogue is OK, nothing great here.  The weak points are the short choppy clips (If 400 video clips are good, are 1000 clips in the same time period better?), and the incessant, irrelevant rock and roll percussion music in the background that seems to drive a furious pace throughout many parts of this production.  You just can't relax and think about what you are seeing, as it flies by in impressionistic fervor.  I don't think the human eyes and brain are really meant for this kind of sensory challenge or bombardment!  I do like the parallax effect of a moving landscape view, as long as it is smooth (not jerky or spasmodic, as it often is here!).  There is also some repetition.  It's good that the animations and video (apart from production) are relatively high quality.  I think this ""new"" style of educational documentary is driven by the sensibilities of the people who think that it is an accomplishment to cram a short story into a 15 second Super Bowl commercial.  If you took the original, uncut video, re-wrote and upgraded the script with contributions from some knowledgable geologists, and replaced the music soundtrack with a more thoughtful audio experience that contributed to the viewing, you could have a very nice four to six hour series here.  The commercial transitions should also be reworked, and each program in the DVD production should be set forth as a full 60 minutes.  The theme?  I don't know.  Maybe it is that ""the Earth is full of changing or destructive forces, and hopefully our species can escape to another planet before something terrible happens here.""  Wishful thinking, but certainly consistent with our current, non-sustainable lifestyle!  Rethink the message if you rewrite it!",3,"nice but short clips, poor production quality",1229990400,"12 23, 2008",2008,1878,"['subject', 'matter', 'very', 'interesting', 'most', 'video', 'clips', 'are', 'great', 'terms', 'resolution', 'four', 'programs', 'good', 'value', 'dialogue', 'OK', 'nothing', 'great', 'here', 'weak', 'points', 'are', 'short', 'choppy', 'clips', '400', 'video', 'clips', 'are', 'good', 'are', '1000', 'clips', 'same', 'time', 'period', 'better', 'incessant', 'irrelevant', 'rock', 'roll', 'percussion', 'music', 'background', 'drive', 'furious', 'pace', 'many', 'parts', 'production', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relax', 'think', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'impressionistic', 'fervor', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'human', 'eyes', 'brain', 'are', 'really', 'meant', 'kind', 'sensory', 'challenge', 'bombardment', 'do', 'parallax', 'effect', 'moving', 'landscape', 'view', 'as', 'long', 'smooth', 'not', 'jerky', 'spasmodic', 'often', 'here', 'also', 'repetition', 'good', 'animations', 'video', 'apart', 'production', 'are', 'relatively', 'high', 'quality', 'think', 'new', 'style', 'educational', 'documentary', 'driven', 'sensibilities', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'accomplishment', 'cram', 'short', 'story', '15', 'second', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'commercial', 'took', 'original', 'uncut', 'video', 're-wrote', 'upgraded', 'script', 'contributions', 'knowledgable', 'geologists', 'replaced', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'audio', 'experience', 'contributed', 'viewing', 'could', 'have', 'very', 'nice', 'four', 'six', 'hour', 'series', 'here', 'commercial', 'transitions', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'reworked', 'program', 'DVD', 'production', 'should', 'be', 'set', 'forth', 'full', '60', 'minutes', 'theme', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Maybe', 'Earth', 'full', 'changing', 'destructive', 'forces', 'hopefully', 'species', 'can', 'escape', 'planet', 'something', 'terrible', 'here', 'Wishful', 'thinking', 'certainly', 'consistent', 'current', 'non-sustainable', 'lifestyle', 'Rethink', 'message', 'rewrite']",National Geographic - Amazing Planet
