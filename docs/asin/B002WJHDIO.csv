It still provides the odd laugh but the dated and, frankly, crappy animation detracts from it. The voice recording is weak as well.The outright strange story line and content make it interesting enough to watch. The interaction between the aliens is some of the best humour of the show. It is topped when our band of heros discovers the cover ups and conspiricies that wounded or mutated them. Especially lawn mower blade guy... whatshisname... ""...they knew dammit! They knew!""Worth a look.
