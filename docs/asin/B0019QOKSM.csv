1164649,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B0019QOKSM,Bobby Underwood,"[206, 209]","I mentioned when writing about season five that this delicately etched and excellently acted series on PBS's ""Mystery"" was my favorite. It still is. I truly believe it is the finest show on television. Nathaniel Parker's Inspector Thomas Lynley and Sharon Small's Barbara Havers are eagerly awaited with passion each season by this viewer like nothing else on television.Based on Elizabeth George's characters, the BBC show has grown and matured into something really special. The mysteries are always well-written and the lead characters have been allowed to let life and what each brings to the table change both themselves and how they view each other. Parker and Small are a fabulous duo who balance each other out.The dashing Lynley was originally paired with Havers because it was taken for granted he would not be distracted by her in a romantic way. But the two quickly found there was more to each other than their reputations, and proved a great team. They also became quite close, their deep friendship and affection for each other rarely dwelled upon but always there beneath the surface.Havers has given the dashing Lynley depth and complexity while he has given her a softer appearance over time. Small really looked terrific in season five with her hair down. Though some griped it was a deviation from the books, it is this intelligent lack of stagnation which has kept things fresh.Season five ended tragically as Lynley's world changed in the blink of an eye when his beloved Helen was killed. One of the most poignant moments of the series found Havers sitting with Lynley after her funeral to make the world wait a few moments. It is intelligent and very real moments such as that which make this show tower head and shoulders above everything else out there.It is for that reason that a massive campaign is being waged to persuade the BBC to continue to produce the show so that PBS fans in America can enjoy these richly mature and intelligent mysteries. The carefully nuanced performances of Nathaniel Parker and Sharon Small as Lynley and Havers would be harder to live without than Lynley's beloved Bristol.Until that happens, we can at least enjoy the two episodes here on season six. In ""Limbo,"" first aired in Australia, the remains of Lynley's godson are discovered twelve years after he was reported missing. Lynley becomes deeply involved with the deceased's sister and will become the prime suspect in a second murder. In ""Know Thine Enemy"" one young schoolgirl kills herself to escape captivity and Lynley and Havers try to find another before tragedy strikes twice.The Inspector Lynley series is smart and atmospheric, Debbie Wiseman's opening music setting the tone for each intriguing installment. Fans cherish this show and hopefully this won't be the last we see of our favorite detectives.",5,Not Dead Yet,1212624000,"06 5, 2008",2008,2828,"['mentioned', 'when', 'writing', 'season', 'five', 'delicately', 'etched', 'excellently', 'acted', 'series', 'PBS', 'Mystery', 'was', 'favorite', 'still', 'truly', 'believe', 'finest', 'show', 'television', 'Nathaniel', 'Parker', 'Inspector', 'Thomas', 'Lynley', 'Sharon', 'Small', 'Barbara', 'Havers', 'are', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'passion', 'season', 'viewer', 'nothing', 'else', 'television.Based', 'Elizabeth', 'George', 'characters', 'BBC', 'show', 'grown', 'matured', 'something', 'really', 'special', 'mysteries', 'are', 'always', 'well-written', 'lead', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'let', 'life', 'what', 'table', 'change', 'how', 'view', 'other', 'Parker', 'Small', 'are', 'fabulous', 'duo', 'who', 'balance', 'other', 'out.The', 'dashing', 'Lynley', 'was', 'originally', 'paired', 'Havers', 'was', 'taken', 'granted', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'distracted', 'romantic', 'way', 'two', 'quickly', 'found', 'was', 'more', 'other', 'reputations', 'proved', 'great', 'team', 'also', 'became', 'quite', 'close', 'deep', 'friendship', 'affection', 'other', 'rarely', 'dwelled', 'upon', 'always', 'surface.Havers', 'given', 'dashing', 'Lynley', 'depth', 'complexity', 'given', 'softer', 'appearance', 'time', 'Small', 'really', 'looked', 'terrific', 'season', 'five', 'hair', 'down', 'griped', 'was', 'deviation', 'books', 'intelligent', 'lack', 'stagnation', 'kept', 'things', 'fresh.Season', 'five', 'ended', 'tragically', 'Lynley', 'world', 'changed', 'blink', 'eye', 'when', 'beloved', 'Helen', 'was', 'killed', 'One', 'most', 'poignant', 'moments', 'series', 'found', 'Havers', 'sitting', 'Lynley', 'funeral', 'make', 'world', 'wait', 'few', 'moments', 'intelligent', 'very', 'real', 'moments', 'such', 'make', 'show', 'head', 'shoulders', 'everything', 'else', 'there.It', 'reason', 'massive', 'campaign', 'being', 'waged', 'persuade', 'BBC', 'continue', 'produce', 'show', 'PBS', 'fans', 'America', 'can', 'enjoy', 'richly', 'mature', 'intelligent', 'mysteries', 'carefully', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'Nathaniel', 'Parker', 'Sharon', 'Small', 'Lynley', 'Havers', 'would', 'be', 'harder', 'live', 'Lynley', 'beloved', 'Bristol.Until', 'can', 'least', 'enjoy', 'two', 'episodes', 'here', 'season', 'six', 'Limbo', 'first', 'aired', 'Australia', 'remains', 'Lynley', 'godson', 'are', 'discovered', 'years', 'was', 'reported', 'missing', 'Lynley', 'deeply', 'involved', 'deceased', 'sister', 'will', 'become', 'prime', 'suspect', 'second', 'murder', 'Know', 'Thine', 'Enemy', 'one', 'young', 'schoolgirl', 'escape', 'captivity', 'Lynley', 'Havers', 'try', 'find', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'twice.The', 'Inspector', 'Lynley', 'series', 'smart', 'atmospheric', 'Debbie', 'Wiseman', 'opening', 'music', 'setting', 'tone', 'intriguing', 'installment', 'Fans', 'cherish', 'show', 'hopefully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'last', 'see', 'favorite', 'detectives']",The Inspector Lynley Mysteries - Series 6

Nathaniel Parker returns as aristocratic Inspector Lynley and Sharon Small as working class Detective Sergeant Havers.This installment contains two episodes.  In the first, ""Limbo"", Inspector Lynley, still grieving from a personal loss (see Set Five) is dragged into a mystery involving the prior disappearence of his godson.  Lynley's efforts to help the family deal with new police evidence ends up enmeshing him in the case as a suspect when the missing boy's sister dies on the street in front of Lynley's temporary residence.  Lynley must rely on Sergeant Havers to run down the evidence that will keep him out of jail long enough to solve both cases.  Havers herself will be in desperate need of assistance by the time the murderer is identified.  The second case,""Know Thine Enemy"", involves the murder of a young girl and the potential threat to an additional victim.  Lynley and Havers must sort through the clues under considerable time duress to try to save the living.  The two will also have to resolve a major difference of opinion over who the real murderer or murderers are.The heart of this series is still the relationship between Lynley and Havers, who have complemented each other in increasingly nuanced ways over the years.  This viewer hopes BBC won't let Set Six be the end of their partnership.

Lynley travels to Rome to convince the Obornes' estranged daughter Julia (Georgina Rylance) to return to England for Justin's funeral. But that effort takes a dangerous turn when Julia's apartment is burgled and Lynley is accused of murder by a ferocious Detective Superintendent Tate (Geraldine Somerville). Lynley and Havers race to solve both old and new mysteries, with the help of forensic pathologist Lafferty (Paul Hickey), before accusations against Lynley turn into charges.Teenaged Sarah Middleton is found dead after having disappeared on her way home from school two weeks before in ""Know Thine Enemy"". When another teenager, Kelly Stevens (Eleanor Gecks), disappears, it starts a serial killer scare. With the pressure on, Lynley, Havers, and DC Ed Harvey (Mark Bonnar) set out to find the red-haired woman whom witnesses placed at the scene of both women's disappearances. That leads to Tania Thompson (Honeysuckle Weeks), whose ambitious and abusive husband Guy (James D'Arcy) makes him the perfect suspect. But Havers and Lynley disagree over Tania's role in the crimes.

I noticed this throughout the series, but especially toward the end.Additionally, the series worked best when based on the stories actually written by Elizabeth George.That said, it is still far and away superior to most of what is aired on US networks -- well-acted and intelligently written.",4,A Favorite British Mystery Series,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,690,"['Likes', 'loved', 'Elizabeth', 'George', 'books', 'especially', 'Sharon', 'Small', 'role', 'totally', 'believable', 'true', 'nature', 'character', 'written.Not', 'sure', 'Not', 'sure', 'Nathaniel', 'Parker', 'was', 'right', 'casting', 'part', 'aristocratic', 'aura', 'down', 'tee', 'books', 'across', 'here', 'little', 'snotty', 'whiny', 'brat', 'lot', 'time', 'noticed', 'series', 'especially', 'end.Additionally', 'series', 'worked', 'best', 'when', 'based', 'stories', 'actually', 'written', 'Elizabeth', 'George.That', 'said', 'still', 'far', 'away', 'superior', 'most', 'what', 'aired', 'US', 'networks', 'well-acted', 'intelligently', 'written']",The Inspector Lynley Mysteries - Series 6

It is enjoyable and entertaining. The first episode, Limbo is the better of the two. The latter episode is a letdown, for me anyway: in viewing this one, I understand why the series wasn't renewed for more episodes. Instead of working together, Havers and Lynley work more against each other in this one. For the price, you only get two episodes here, instead of the usual four, so the purchase is up to you.",3,"Enjoyable, but not as great as the rest!!",1319587200,"10 26, 2011",2011,517,"['series', 'one', 'favorite', 'British', 'shows', 'last', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'previous', 'episodes', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'first', 'episode', 'Limbo', 'better', 'two', 'latter', 'episode', 'letdown', 'anyway', 'viewing', 'one', 'understand', 'why', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'renewed', 'more', 'episodes', 'Instead', 'working', 'together', 'Havers', 'Lynley', 'work', 'more', 'other', 'one', 'price', 'only', 'get', 'two', 'episodes', 'here', 'instead', 'usual', 'four', 'purchase', 'up']",The Inspector Lynley Mysteries - Series 6
1164671,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0019QOKSM,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","I only discovered the Inspector Lynley mysteries several weeks ago, but as soon as I watched the first episode I was hooked! The writing on this series is intelligent, with well-crafted, credible plots, and superior acting by the main characters, DI Thomas Lynley (played by Nathaniel Parker) and DS Barbara Havers (Sharon Small) and also the supporting actors. Each hour and a half episode is paced just right, with enough tension and red herrings to keep a crime drama fan enthralled.This last series only has two episodes on it, i.e. Limbo and Know Thine Enemy. Both are some of the best writing and acting I've seen on this series, and I just don't understand why the producers did not continue with this excellent series. Was it a question of budget constraints or the lack of additional storylines? It is hard for me to accept either because there are too many inferior shows out there that are still being continued, and given the great track record of this series in terms of acting and writing, I imagine it would not be difficult to attract top-notch writers. Anyway, it is a pity to see such a wonderful, intelligent crime series end.Nathaniel Parker plays a tormented, grieving Lynley to the hilt in Limbo, which deals with an old crime that is soon revealed to be a murder, and Lynley gets into trouble with the law when an indiscreet affair lands him as a prime suspect in a crime. It is up to Havers to help him out and Lynley races against time to clear his name. In the sinister Know Thine Enemy, the body of a schoolgirl is found in a lake, and soon revealed to be a murder. Then a second schoolgirl turns up missing, and Lynley and Havers soon realize that they have a potential serial killer on their hands. This episode is truly chilling, and it finally dawned on me that the plot was inspired by the real life case of Carla Homolka. The acting and pacing of this episode was one of the best I've seen in a crime drama in a long while.Lynley and Havers will be missed, and I hope at some point they'll be brought back (the original cast) in a special or TV movie.",5,"A fantastic crime series, and a pity it ended",1317513600,"10 2, 2011",2011,2084,"['only', 'discovered', 'Inspector', 'Lynley', 'mysteries', 'several', 'weeks', 'ago', 'as', 'soon', 'watched', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'hooked', 'writing', 'series', 'intelligent', 'well-crafted', 'credible', 'plots', 'superior', 'acting', 'main', 'characters', 'DI', 'Thomas', 'Lynley', 'played', 'Nathaniel', 'Parker', 'DS', 'Barbara', 'Havers', 'Sharon', 'Small', 'also', 'supporting', 'actors', 'hour', 'half', 'episode', 'paced', 'just', 'right', 'enough', 'tension', 'red', 'herrings', 'keep', 'crime', 'drama', 'fan', 'enthralled.This', 'last', 'series', 'only', 'two', 'episodes', 'i.e', 'Limbo', 'Know', 'Thine', 'Enemy', 'are', 'best', 'writing', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'series', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'producers', 'did', 'not', 'continue', 'excellent', 'series', 'Was', 'question', 'budget', 'constraints', 'lack', 'additional', 'storylines', 'hard', 'accept', 'either', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'inferior', 'shows', 'out', 'there', 'are', 'still', 'being', 'continued', 'given', 'great', 'track', 'record', 'series', 'terms', 'acting', 'writing', 'imagine', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'difficult', 'attract', 'top-notch', 'writers', 'Anyway', 'pity', 'see', 'such', 'wonderful', 'intelligent', 'crime', 'series', 'end.Nathaniel', 'Parker', 'tormented', 'grieving', 'Lynley', 'hilt', 'Limbo', 'old', 'crime', 'soon', 'revealed', 'be', 'murder', 'Lynley', 'trouble', 'law', 'when', 'indiscreet', 'affair', 'prime', 'suspect', 'crime', 'Havers', 'help', 'out', 'Lynley', 'races', 'time', 'clear', 'name', 'sinister', 'Know', 'Thine', 'Enemy', 'body', 'schoolgirl', 'found', 'lake', 'soon', 'revealed', 'be', 'murder', 'Then', 'second', 'schoolgirl', 'up', 'missing', 'Lynley', 'Havers', 'soon', 'realize', 'have', 'potential', 'serial', 'killer', 'hands', 'episode', 'truly', 'chilling', 'finally', 'dawned', 'plot', 'was', 'inspired', 'real', 'life', 'case', 'Carla', 'Homolka', 'acting', 'pacing', 'episode', 'was', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'crime', 'drama', 'long', 'while.Lynley', 'Havers', 'will', 'be', 'missed', 'hope', 'point', ""'ll"", 'be', 'brought', 'back', 'original', 'cast', 'special', 'TV', 'movie']",The Inspector Lynley Mysteries - Series 6
