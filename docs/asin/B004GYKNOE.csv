1407479,AVZOYQ31XCDHZ,B004GYKNOE,Demerit,"[6, 12]","Low-budget, one camera movie. Not that there's anything wrong with that...I think this movie deserves some credit. Although it takes a lot of patience to get through this one, it has heart.This barely-can-be-considered-an-adaptation of ""Frankenstein"" contains too many public domain classic horror movie clips. It's enormously apparent that writer, director, and producer ""Creeper McCreepersin"" is a big classic horror movie fan.I would have rather seen Mr. Creepersin...well, actually first I would rather him use his real name. I feel like he's torn between the campy movies of the 50's, 60's and 70's and the classics of the 20's and 30's (henceforth referred to as ""the classics"").That's where I think this movie could have been 4-5 stars: by focusing on classic horror movies and using the *techniques* found in those films instead of using clips of them. Sure, maybe the idealized sets would've been a budget-killer, but the cinematography could have been approximated and the stage makeup, ever-so-slightly hinted at. To his credit, the writer/director/producer touches on this, but it would've been amaaaazing if he had made it a pervasive treatment or theme.Some scenes lag and others seem redundant. With some tightened editing and additional written material (perhaps more geographical and historical background of the main character) it could have maintained or exceeded its 55-minute run-time.Which gets me to the title sequences. The beginning title sequence is so long, you'll want to bounce on over and watch ""Zombie Strippers"" for the umpteenth time (don't lie). By mimicking the classics, the credits could have been presented by filling the screen with them, over 1-3 ""slides."" Set the mood, move on to the storytelling.Overall, I like the idea of this film. It's charming and maniacal at times. Even with being somewhat tongue-in-cheek and referencing later horror movies, if there was less ""I like classic horror movies"" and more ""I want to make a modern interpretation of an old classic horror movie,"" I think this idea could have really shone.",3,I'm torn,1349136000,"10 2, 2012",2012,2066,"['Low-budget', 'one', 'camera', 'movie', 'Not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'think', 'movie', 'credit', 'lot', 'patience', 'get', 'one', 'heart.This', 'barely-can-be-considered-an-adaptation', 'Frankenstein', 'too', 'many', 'public', 'domain', 'classic', 'horror', 'movie', 'clips', 'enormously', 'apparent', 'writer', 'director', 'producer', 'Creeper', 'McCreepersin', 'big', 'classic', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan.I', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'seen', 'Mr.', 'Creepersin', 'well', 'actually', 'first', 'would', 'rather', 'use', 'real', 'name', 'feel', 'torn', 'campy', 'movies', '50', '60', '70', 'classics', '20', '30', 'henceforth', 'referred', 'classics', '.That', 'where', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', '4-5', 'stars', 'focusing', 'classic', 'horror', 'movies', 'using', '*techniques*', 'found', 'films', 'instead', 'using', 'clips', 'Sure', 'maybe', 'idealized', 'sets', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'budget-killer', 'cinematography', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'approximated', 'stage', 'makeup', 'ever-so-slightly', 'hinted', 'credit', 'writer/director/producer', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'amaaaazing', 'had', 'made', 'pervasive', 'treatment', 'theme.Some', 'scenes', 'lag', 'others', 'seem', 'redundant', 'tightened', 'editing', 'additional', 'written', 'material', 'perhaps', 'more', 'geographical', 'historical', 'background', 'main', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'maintained', 'exceeded', '55-minute', 'run-time.Which', 'title', 'sequences', 'beginning', 'title', 'sequence', 'so', 'long', ""'ll"", 'want', 'bounce', 'watch', 'Zombie', 'Strippers', 'umpteenth', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'lie', 'mimicking', 'classics', 'credits', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'presented', 'filling', 'screen', '1-3', 'slides', 'Set', 'mood', 'move', 'storytelling.Overall', 'like', 'idea', 'film', 'charming', 'maniacal', 'times', 'Even', 'being', 'somewhat', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'referencing', 'later', 'horror', 'movies', 'was', 'less', 'like', 'classic', 'horror', 'movies', 'more', 'want', 'make', 'modern', 'interpretation', 'old', 'classic', 'horror', 'movie', 'think', 'idea', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'shone']",Frankenstein
