But what made the movie good was DeRay Davis.  Yes Kelly Rowland and Duane Martin were good and had great chemistry but DeRay was hysterical.  He added a great sense of comedy to the movie.  One thing that could have been added was more lines for Kyla Pratt, she is an good actress and would have brought a nice dimension to the movie.  But all in all this was an enjoyable movie and I would recommend it.  Hats of to Will, Jada, Duane and Tisha for creating the Momentum Experience it is definately much needed in the African American community to see positive love stories that don't look like they were made on a low budget.

Kelly Rowland,  singer, model, and 1/3rd of super group Destiny's Child stars in the movie as Jhnele.  Jhnele is an internationally known singer.  Duane Martin (who hasn't aged since his early 90's series ""Up All Night"") stars as Derrick.  Derrick is a law student.  He and his friend E.J. work as seat fillers to make a little extra money.At an awards show she is seated next to Derrick and sparks fly.  The problem with Derrick and Jhnele the couple is that Derrick is living a lie when it comes to his relationship with Jhnele.  She thinks that he is a powerful Hollywood lawyer.  Derrick is everything Jhnele wants in a man, he is far more considerate than her previous man (portrayed by actor Shemar Moore).  Jhnele confides in her confidant and personal assistant Sandie.  Sandie is portrayed by another real life pop star, former Spice Girl Melanie Brown shines in her role as Jhenele's best friend.  Kelly Rowland can really act and her and Duane Martin have great on screen chemistry.  The Seat Filler is a great feel good movie.  Comedian DeRay Davis has a large role in the movie and he really brings the funny in every scene that he is in. Will Derrick and Jhenele's relationship survive when she learns that he is really just a law student?The Seat Filler is a really great romantic comedy that all audiences will enjoy.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","A seat filler has it pretty cushy, his or her sole task merely to keep warm the seats of celebrities and big wigs at award functions. This is so that there aren't embarassing empty spots when the cameras pan by. There are a few rules to the gig: no cell phones allowed, you can only clap 5 times, your heinie can't be too warm. And the cardinal rule: you mustn't ever, ever fraternize with the stars. Sounds like easy money. But not, as it turns out, for Derrick Harver.At the Videobeat Awards show, struggling law student and part time seat filler Derrick Harver (Duane Martin) gets seating duties next to famous and lovely singer Jhnelle (Kelly Rowland of Destiny's Child). Shattering the no fraternizing rule, Derrick engages her in a fleeting conversation, and the two instantly click. So she falls in love, and he falls in love. But a misunderstanding leads Jhnelle to believe that Derrick is some big time entertainment lawyer named Alonzo Grant. And now Derrick's cornered himself into keeping up a pretense. You know she'll find out, and you can guess how it'll all turn out. Question is, is the picture worth sticking around for as it goes thru its been there, done that paces?Yes, it is. THE SEAT FILLER is a romantic comedy which came out in 2004, and it is modest and engaging and unpretentious. And much, much funnier than I expected. True, the film is lightweight and utterly predictable, but the acting and comic talents of the cast achieve a kind of grace which effortlessly overcomes the flaws. Earnest, down-to-earth Duane Martin and sweet songbird Kelly Rowland ignite romantic sparks, while Deray Davis and Melanie Brown (formerly Scary Spice of the Spice Girls) shine as Derrick and Jhnelle's respective best buds. Deray Davis, in particular, made me laugh a boatload of times. Dude is some kind of hysterical! Even Shemar Moore's jerkweed, third-person-referencing character garners some chuckles (but not many).Again, much of the film's charm is directly linked to the two leads. Martin and Rowland are very good together, and we can't help but savor their characters' relationship as they experience the highs and lows of being newly in love. Of course, there's also that Cinderella fantasy element lurking about. The average guy landing the beautiful celebrity. Now, I realize that once the seat filler plot device had propelled Derrick and Jhnelle together, its job was basically done. But, still, I wish there'd been more of a focus on the seat filler aspect and its role in the various award shows. I'm just being selfish, though, because I really wanted to see the Latin Gospel Awards, as hosted by Chuck D.

It is a romantic comedy born of the same formula of all romantic comedies. In fact, you pretty much know how it is going to end well before it even starts Despite that, this movie works-  Destiny's Child's Kelly Rowland done pretty well in her role. She stars as the ambitious superstar singer who strives for love and a regular life and co-star Duane Martin play as the charming seat filler. I've always been critical of Duane Martin - but he is likeable in this movie and he fits well with Rowland in this production. I actually think it is good that this film is uncomplicated and straightforward especially for the times you just want to chill.The film does start off a bit slow but you can see the connection between Duane and Kelly's characters bonding through out the movie even after the big break up. I had some difficulty with Shemar Moore's character. At the time, Shemar had taken a break a year ago from ""Young and the Restless"" before this film was completed. So, it was strange how he was betraying an arrogant soap star in the movie. As great as he is, this wasn't one of Shemar's best performances compared to ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" or ""Criminal Minds."" Kyla Pratt had a small role in the film as Duane's little sister. New comer, DeRay Davis, brings comedy to the film which keeps it from being boring or too serious. You can see him also featured in ""the Fog"" 2005 w/ Tom Welling (""Smallville"" of WB/CW and ""Cheaper by the Dozen"") as well. The person who surprised me the most was Melanie Brown (Scary Spice from the Spice Girls group). She played Kelly's assistant and best friend in the film that made it a point to direct her successful boss in love and life.While viewing this you can clearly see that this is a low budget film but the concept of this movie was interesting. Producers Will and Jada Smith, D'Angela Steed, Tisha Campbell Martin, Blair Underwood and the entire Momentum group have committed to producing quality black films featuring good scripts and story lines, talented actors and actresses and viewing them in smaller or more unusual markets.So, with all of that said, I wish they had the opportunity to release this in theaters so that every one would get a chance to see it, it would allow people to see a good/decent romantic black comedy and know that we can do other things besides sell drugs and gun down people in the streets. If you are a fan of independent films as I am, you will like it 'til the end.

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[3, 4]","I really love what Tisha Campbell, Duane Martin, Will Smith, etc. are doing with this new production to bring more (unstereotypical) black films out. Hollywood is still far too stuck on goofiness to bring to the cinema world and these three are not having it, so I was definitely going to support this movie.  Now, for the Pros and Cons.Cons: This movie was very predictable.  I was looking for there to be a great big climax or something, but pretty much whatever you guess would happen in any major chick flick happened in this movie.  Man chases woman, man cannot meet woman's economic standpoint, man lies to woman, woman finds out from (isn't there always one?) ex-boyfriend, man tries to get woman back.  By the end of the movie, I was rolling my eyes and thinking this had to be the corniest movie I'd seen all year.  People who like ""love stories"" will sniffle and ""awww"" all through this movie.  I just shook my head and went ""This is way too storybook for me.""  There was so much comedy in the Deleted Scenes that I wish would've been in the movie, but was not.  I wasn't really feeling either of the songs that Kelly Rowland's character performed, but the dance moves were cute.Pros:  The idea of the movie was unique and I'd never heard of seat fillers until this movie came out, but it sure makes sense because if I saw awards shows with empty seats all over the place, I'd wonder ""Why'd no one show up?""  I love how the producers, cast directors, etc. flipped the script in this movie and had the legal tutor be not only black, but African, and business-minded. I definitely enjoyed the ""prodigy"" who was so doggone funny!  I was so hurt that he wasn't a major actor in this movie, because watching the ""Deleted Scenes"" showed me that he definitely made the movie interesting, I wish there was more of him and more sibling rivalry between the young lady who's on ""One on One"" and Duane Martin's character.  It was very cool to see ""Coronel Taylor"" again and see a full black family.  I think the moviemakers represented black people in such a positive light that although I thought the movie was corny, I'd still recommend it because it is so important to see.  We need more positive movies like this one to show that black people can make it as singers, lawyers, students, teachers, fathers, mothers, etc.  I liked the song during the ending credits that Kelly Rowland sang too!",3,New to the Table,1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,2393,"['really', 'love', 'what', 'Tisha', 'Campbell', 'Duane', 'Martin', 'Will', 'Smith', 'etc', 'are', 'doing', 'new', 'production', 'bring', 'more', 'unstereotypical', 'black', 'films', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'still', 'far', 'too', 'stuck', 'goofiness', 'bring', 'cinema', 'world', 'three', 'are', 'not', 'having', 'was', 'definitely', 'going', 'support', 'movie', 'Now', 'Pros', 'Cons.Cons', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'predictable', 'was', 'looking', 'be', 'great', 'big', 'climax', 'something', 'pretty', 'much', 'guess', 'would', 'happen', 'major', 'chick', 'flick', 'happened', 'movie', 'Man', 'woman', 'man', 'can', 'not', 'meet', 'woman', 'economic', 'standpoint', 'man', 'woman', 'woman', 'out', ""n't"", 'always', 'one', 'ex-boyfriend', 'man', 'tries', 'get', 'woman', 'back', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'thinking', 'had', 'be', 'corniest', 'movie', ""'d"", 'seen', 'year', 'People', 'who', 'love', 'stories', 'will', 'sniffle', 'awww', 'movie', 'just', 'shook', 'head', 'went', 'way', 'too', 'storybook', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'comedy', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'wish', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'feeling', 'songs', 'Kelly', 'Rowland', 'character', 'performed', 'dance', 'moves', 'were', 'cute.Pros', 'idea', 'movie', 'was', 'unique', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'seat', 'fillers', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'sure', 'sense', 'saw', 'awards', 'empty', 'seats', 'place', ""'d"", 'wonder', 'Why', ""'d"", 'one', 'show', 'up', 'love', 'how', 'producers', 'cast', 'directors', 'etc', 'flipped', 'script', 'movie', 'had', 'legal', 'tutor', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'black', 'African', 'business-minded', 'definitely', 'enjoyed', 'prodigy', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'doggone', 'funny', 'was', 'so', 'hurt', 'was', ""n't"", 'major', 'actor', 'movie', 'watching', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'showed', 'definitely', 'made', 'movie', 'interesting', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'more', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'One', 'One', 'Duane', 'Martin', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'cool', 'see', 'Coronel', 'Taylor', 'again', 'see', 'full', 'black', 'family', 'think', 'moviemakers', 'represented', 'black', 'people', 'such', 'positive', 'light', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'corny', ""'d"", 'still', 'recommend', 'so', 'important', 'see', 'need', 'more', 'positive', 'movies', 'one', 'show', 'black', 'people', 'can', 'make', 'singers', 'lawyers', 'students', 'teachers', 'fathers', 'mothers', 'etc', 'liked', 'song', 'ending', 'credits', 'Kelly', 'Rowland', 'sang', 'too']",The Seat Filler
