It's filmed in black and white and it's one of those films that breaks the fourth wall..  It's like they took a video camera and started filming a mental case and the audience gets to watch as he goes from nice guy to killer. Around his family hes nice and when alone and around his friends hes psycho.As far as it being disturbing its about a 7-8 out of 10. Some parts were deeply disturbing, others funny. It's hard to imagine how anything could be funny in a movie like this but they managed to mix disturbing with humor. One scene will have you laughing, another will have you shaking your head.I really couldn't say what I liked or didnt like about this film.

Wonderful films like `Best in Show' or `Drop Dead Gorgeous' are magnificent examples of exploitation of harmless activities that we as a culture take too seriously.`C'est Arrive Pres de Chez Vous' (translated `It Happened in Your Neighborhood' yet strangely named `Man Bites Dog') does not fit into that mold.On the outset this film is laced with a black comedy both intriguing and inviting, yet the end result is one of repulsion and guilt.  `C'est Arrive Pres de Chez Vous' strikes a nerve because it's not merely exposing harmless guilty pleasures; it is calling out our society's sick attraction to violence and suffering.  It's like a comedic version of Kubrick's masterpiece `A Clockwork Orange'; a film that makes light of violence in order to add weight to the subject; a film that gives an air of triviality in order to shock the audience into realizing that they don't take this as seriously as they should.  I remember watching `A Clockwork Orange' with open mouth and straining eyes and by the time `C'est Arrive Pres de Chez Vous' was through I was in the very same predicament.The film follows a camera crew as they follow a serial killer by the name of Ben.  Ben murders and robs with reckless abandon and is actually flattered that this group of young men wants to document his lifestyle.  His reactions and methods are criminal yet presented in a manner that elicits laughs and smiles from the audience.  This succeeds in creating an air within the audience, one of lighthearted glee as they think they are watching just another comedy.  But they are not, and as the film tapers to a close and the violence gets more extreme, the audience suddenly realizes that their enjoyment in this film is further proving the point of the filmmakers; that our society is so calloused to the sadism surrounding us that it rarely shocks us.We realize that we shouldn't be finding any of this `funny' and the fact that we do sickens us.The performances by the entire cast are flawless, but no one deserves more credit than Benoit Poelvoorde who plays the serial killer Ben.  His performance is flamboyant and charismatic and convincing; completely dedicated to the material and essential to the desired effect of the film on the audience; us.In the end I feel that `C'est Arrive Pres de Chez Vous' is an extremely important film.  This film reminds me of the feelings derived from reading Bret Easton Ellis' phenomenal novel `American Psycho', a novel that exposed our cultures calloused condition flawlessly.  `C'est Arrive Pres de Chez Vous' is not for the faint of heart or the weak of stomach but it is monumentally important for it calls to attention a growing problem, a problem that will only continue to get bigger.",5,A comedy not to be taken lightly...,1211155200,"05 19, 2008",2008,2881,"['Mockumentary', 'are', 'often', 'hilarious', 'exaggerations', 'human', 'obsessions', 'presented', 'way', 'laugh', 'ourselves', 'own', 'pathetic', 'indulgences', 'Wonderful', 'films', 'Best', 'Show', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Gorgeous', 'are', 'magnificent', 'examples', 'exploitation', 'harmless', 'activities', 'culture', 'take', 'too', 'seriously.', ""C'est"", 'Arrive', 'Pres', 'de', 'Chez', 'Vous', 'translated', 'Happened', 'Your', 'Neighborhood', 'yet', 'strangely', 'named', 'Man', 'Dog', 'not', 'fit', 'outset', 'film', 'laced', 'black', 'comedy', 'intriguing', 'inviting', 'yet', 'end', 'result', 'one', 'repulsion', 'guilt', ""C'est"", 'Arrive', 'Pres', 'de', 'Chez', 'Vous', 'strikes', 'nerve', 'not', 'merely', 'exposing', 'harmless', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'calling', 'out', 'society', 'sick', 'attraction', 'violence', 'suffering', 'comedic', 'version', 'Kubrick', 'masterpiece', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'film', 'light', 'violence', 'order', 'add', 'weight', 'subject', 'film', 'air', 'triviality', 'order', 'shock', 'audience', 'realizing', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'as', 'seriously', 'should', 'remember', 'watching', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'open', 'mouth', 'straining', 'eyes', 'time', ""C'est"", 'Arrive', 'Pres', 'de', 'Chez', 'Vous', 'was', 'was', 'very', 'same', 'predicament.The', 'film', 'camera', 'crew', 'follow', 'serial', 'killer', 'name', 'Ben', 'Ben', 'murders', 'robs', 'reckless', 'abandon', 'actually', 'flattered', 'group', 'young', 'men', 'document', 'lifestyle', 'reactions', 'methods', 'are', 'criminal', 'yet', 'presented', 'manner', 'laughs', 'smiles', 'audience', 'creating', 'air', 'audience', 'one', 'lighthearted', 'glee', 'think', 'are', 'watching', 'just', 'comedy', 'are', 'not', 'film', 'tapers', 'close', 'violence', 'more', 'extreme', 'audience', 'suddenly', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'further', 'proving', 'point', 'filmmakers', 'society', 'so', 'calloused', 'sadism', 'surrounding', 'rarely', 'us.We', 'realize', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'finding', 'funny', 'fact', 'do', 'sickens', 'us.The', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'are', 'flawless', 'one', 'more', 'credit', 'Benoit', 'Poelvoorde', 'who', 'serial', 'killer', 'Ben', 'performance', 'flamboyant', 'charismatic', 'convincing', 'completely', 'dedicated', 'material', 'essential', 'desired', 'effect', 'film', 'audience', 'end', 'feel', ""C'est"", 'Arrive', 'Pres', 'de', 'Chez', 'Vous', 'extremely', 'important', 'film', 'film', 'feelings', 'derived', 'reading', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'phenomenal', 'novel', 'American', 'Psycho', 'novel', 'exposed', 'cultures', 'calloused', 'condition', 'flawlessly', ""C'est"", 'Arrive', 'Pres', 'de', 'Chez', 'Vous', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'weak', 'stomach', 'monumentally', 'important', 'attention', 'growing', 'problem', 'problem', 'will', 'only', 'continue', 'get', 'bigger']",N/A
341213,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,6302860598,Anton Ilinski,"[1, 1]","""Man Bites Dog"" is very surprising, challenging, bold and extremely satiric. It's about a crew of film-makers doing a documentary about a serial killer.The movie is made in Belgium and as we all know it is considered to be a very happy and safe European country. But here I guess Belgium personifies the whole Europe where as we can see things are a little bit rotten.Ben-the killer who's played by Benot Poelvoorde (brilliant work!) is rather sympathetic person at the first glance, he says interesting things, he's cheerful and smart but behind his smile and inspirational speeches the stench of decay can be smelled. And it's not just him who's decomposing - it's the world itself. We see the film-makers following their subject and not even once they question themselves: what the hell are we doing? What the hell is he doing? What in God's name is going on? They exist in the world which became self-absorbed and egocentric where nothing else matters except some insubstantial things. And if at first they try to distance themselves from Ben later they become fully legitimate participants of all the atrocities he's doing during his murderous spree.""Man Bites Dog"" is about the world gone insane and it can affect you a lot. It's in b&w;, very austere so the effect will just be stronger. The alternative title for the movie was ""It Happened in Your Neighborhood"".

341216,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6302860598,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 12/13Rate: 1012/13: It's been years since I've seen a most daring, original picture, and this time, it's Man Bites Dog. Quite so, thanks to Benot Poelvoorde's arresting Oscar-worthy performance, it's also one of the most compelling movies I've ever seen. Honestly, it's a one-man tour de force show, and Benot Poelvoorde can't be more charming, likeable, and manipulative than he is in Man Bites Dog. The film is like watching Reservoir Dogs, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, and This Is Spinal Tap all rolled in one. Michael Rooker's Henry is the unsmiling sociopathic with a very myopic view of the world while Benot Poelvoorde's Ben is the fun-loving sociopathic with a very open view of the world. He is also the talker who is knowledgeable and worldly in many areas, analyzing situations and giving a philosophical point of view. Both of the characters are so alike because they kill without compunction. They kill without sympathy. It's just a fact of life to them. The Spinal Tap technique is probably the most effective gimmick of the whole show because it's so interesting to see the filmmakers slowly being manipulated minute by minute into Ben's world by helping to dispose the bodies, to clean up the mess, and to participate in the crimes. In short, they became accessory to the fact and went along with it which makes things pretty weird; hence, the intrepidity of Man Bites Dog. Sure, there is the conversational quality about it, very similar to the other canine-titled picture, Reservoir Dogs. That's why Man Bites Dog is so watchable and arresting. Unfortunately, the film drags a bit in the second half, losing some of the momentum. However, Man Bites Dog manages to salvage itself by turning the tables around and making things a bit interesting; sort of a karma biting on Ben's ass. I think about the title, and why it is called so. Usually, the dog bites the man, but this time, to go the opposite, it's the man biting the dog. The film proves the point. All in all, Man Bites Dog certainly gets its place at the upper echelon of the Best Cult Films list and is arguably one of the greatest movies made.",5,All the Way to the Top.,1386201600,"12 5, 2013",2013,2136,"['Viewed', '12/13Rate', '1012/13', 'been', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'daring', 'original', 'picture', 'time', 'Man', 'Bites', 'Dog', 'Quite', 'so', 'thanks', 'Benot', 'Poelvoorde', 'arresting', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'compelling', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Honestly', 'one-man', 'tour', 'force', 'show', 'Benot', 'Poelvoorde', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'charming', 'likeable', 'manipulative', 'Man', 'Bites', 'Dog', 'film', 'watching', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'Henry', 'Portrait', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'rolled', 'one', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'Henry', 'unsmiling', 'sociopathic', 'very', 'myopic', 'view', 'world', 'Benot', 'Poelvoorde', 'Ben', 'fun-loving', 'sociopathic', 'very', 'open', 'view', 'world', 'also', 'talker', 'who', 'knowledgeable', 'worldly', 'many', 'areas', 'analyzing', 'situations', 'giving', 'philosophical', 'point', 'view', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'alike', 'kill', 'compunction', 'kill', 'sympathy', 'just', 'fact', 'life', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'technique', 'probably', 'most', 'effective', 'gimmick', 'whole', 'show', 'so', 'interesting', 'see', 'filmmakers', 'slowly', 'being', 'manipulated', 'minute', 'minute', 'Ben', 'world', 'helping', 'dispose', 'bodies', 'clean', 'up', 'mess', 'participate', 'crimes', 'short', 'became', 'accessory', 'fact', 'went', 'things', 'pretty', 'weird', 'hence', 'intrepidity', 'Man', 'Bites', 'Dog', 'Sure', 'conversational', 'quality', 'very', 'similar', 'other', 'canine-titled', 'picture', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'why', 'Man', 'Dog', 'so', 'watchable', 'arresting', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'bit', 'second', 'half', 'losing', 'momentum', 'However', 'Man', 'Bites', 'Dog', 'salvage', 'turning', 'tables', 'making', 'things', 'bit', 'interesting', 'sort', 'karma', 'biting', 'Ben', 'ass', 'think', 'title', 'why', 'called', 'so', 'Usually', 'dog', 'man', 'time', 'go', 'opposite', 'man', 'biting', 'dog', 'film', 'point', 'Man', 'Bites', 'Dog', 'certainly', 'place', 'upper', 'echelon', 'Best', 'Cult', 'Films', 'list', 'arguably', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'made']",N/A

On the opposite side are mockumenataries who satarize the hell out of the issues that documentaries attempt to discuss and debate seriously and intellectually; Mockumentaries such as Spinal Tap take pleasure in diligently mocking their subjects. Sometimes the effects can be as offbeat as Bruno or as idiosyncratic as Waiting for Guffman. Man Bites Dog, however, treads ground that no documentary has tread before; actually it covers ground that rarely even films attempt to discuss seriously.Man Bites Dog is a fictional documentary following a serial killer, documenting his daily exploits. The serial killer, Benoit, is followed by a film crew whose sole responsibility-initially-is to document his interactions with his family members, victims, and his general ideology on society. As it may be assumed, these filmmakers do not have the most noble taste in choosing their subjects, but they also lack the funding to complete the project as they wish. Benoit promises them that he will help them found their project, and with his seemingly innocent promise, the participation of the film crew in the crimes begin; who is some instances actually aid him in dispatching the bodies or even participating actively in the crime.Benoit is no ordinary serial killer. His philosophy is different from usual portrayals because his ideologies on suburban life and media as conspiracy-like as it may seem, rings true. In addition, he does not kill simply to fulfill some nagging carnal desire, but he kills because the source of his income were his victims possessions. Even his girlfriend shares in the delusion, that as unusual as his work maybe, everyone has got to live somehow-besides the victims, of course. His family, from his mother to his grandparents, are pleasant folks, and it is in their presence that the best of Benoit's empathy and love is displayed. They are not knowledgeable of his work; however, they do indirectly condemn his work as it appears in the newspaper-not knowing that it is their son who is the culprit of many crimes occurring in the city.The Crimes, themselves, are merciless, gory, uncensored, and most of all excessive. The audience witnesses dozens and dozens of corpses, murders, and even an account of  rape throughout the film. The killing itself is genuinely interesting, at times consisting of original ideas in the murder of the elderly, but the processes of disposing of the corpses is unrealistic and not believable. There are scenes where Benoit is hauling a body in the vicinity of a moving train, or using the most unprofessional methods, to a serial killer, of getting rid of his victims. If the police even were remotely active in such a city, they were bound to identify Benoit with every murder he commits. After a while, we wonder how is that after so many gunshots, suffocations, and basically instances of crime on a relatively stable community, the Police have no suspect and no lead. Benoit does explains that the reason, but his answer is not accepted sufficient enough to excuse his entire output. If it is accepted that the camera crew follow Benoit for less than half a year, considering his age, it can be speculated that Benoit has killed  the equivalent of entire villages of people without a lead pointing towards him.Man Bites Dog intent is to satirize the sorry state of contemporary media's scrutiny of controversial people and issues. It implies how the media simply sees the people it documents as subjects rather than individuals who may need or desire help and guidance. The Film crew follows Benoit without really comprehending  what horrific incidents they are filming, and even lending a hand in the crimes. In other words, in the process of documenting such certain events, the media can become as cruel as the perpetrator of an incident, or rather become him. In a truly bizarre case, Benoit murders a person who also has a film crew with him, demonstrating one of the funniest and most poignant moments of the film. A question, however, that must be asked is if Man Bites Dog is a critique of certain aspects of society, or if it is a vehicle for exploiting mutilated corpses, long rape scenes and other mentioned unpleasant aspects of Benoit's ""craft."" The answer is that it is a very wise critique in its own respect, but as the running time progresses the film slowly shifts towards exploitation. As this happens, the gravity of Benoit's work becomes less tragic, as corpse after corpse is displayed to us. In the end, all the unpleasant sights are simply excessive, losing their shocking and tragic elements.Man Bites Dog as great a satire as it may be, overstays its welcome by reducing Benoit from a killer with an agenda to a deranged serial killer. The film is among those works that should have retained a shorter length because the longer it gets, the more focus it loses, and the more its timely criticisms seem to strain on. The graphic nature of Man Bites Dog should not be taken lightly, as it demonstrates the murders with vivid detail, and incorporates cruel and disturbing methods in some instances. The film also caves in when one considers certain unanswered questions, such as: why are these fictional filmmakers, who lack financial stability, following such a subject around for their documentary? Documenting a serial killer's exploits does not carry ideal commercial weight as to grant these filmmakers fame or riches. The fictional filmmakers seem pleasant people who truly wish to demonstrate something great with this work, but considering the subject matter and the detail which they film the issue in hand, it seems they are in delusion concerning what this film really and truly demonstrates. Even Benoit doesn't dwell on why they would want to film him, even if there was a valid reason, wouldn't the release of the film endanger his work? Man Bites Dog may be as violent as the society it satirizes, but to leave its desired effect it does need to attain such a level of violence; without it, our disgust and pity of our own society would not be as drastic as it should be.",3,"Excess is not offensive, but rather dims the shocking and philosophical aspect of the work",1278892800,"07 12, 2010",2010,6278,"['Intriguing', 'useful',

Let's get that clear...This rotted-out carcass of a film that Belgium spat out in the early-nineties as a satirical look at reality entertainment (which wasn't much of an issue in 1992, so maybe that's why people see a joyous precognitive quality about this) concerns a film crew who follows around a brutal serial killer whose slaying after dirty filthy slaying remains unchecked by human morality, and as his rampages continue, the filmmakers gradually become his unwitting accomplices.Big deal. The film fails as social commentary (we get it, we get it) and as black humor (not funny, not particularly clever). So what's the point, really?  The film wants to shock us into submission by casually brushing off infanticide, thievery, and gang-rape, but I was never offended by the relentless violence and gore, I was offended by how boring and tedious this whole project turned out to be.The serial killer is the star of this movie, and the only character we get to know at all. His relationships are under-developed, his psychology untapped, his motivations unclear. The actor (co-director Benot Poelvoorde) is cloying, unattractive, and has severe overacting issues.The film  has a completely un-arresting visual style, and is badly edited. The repetitive circular scenes of chaos where we see (again and again) lots of running and shooting and dying wear thin almost instantly, making for not a single redeemable quality in the entire movie. The Mahabarata didn't seem as long as the 92 minutes that this movie took to make a single gruesome point over and over again.The film is shot entirely in grainy black and white, and is extremely talky. The white, rapid-fire French-to-English subtitles are punishing to the eyes.Those viewers more in touch with a sense of virtue, intelligence, and beauty simply won't get past how sick all the killing is, never mind all the rest of the ugly flaws peppered like acne scars across the screen.

341223,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,6302860598,Carl Manes,"[0, 1]","Shot in a gritty 35mm documentary format, MAN BITES DOG is a film about making film that uses a charismatic but merciless serial killer as its central focus. An Independent film crew follows the charming Benoit through his daily activities, waxing intellectual in the spare moments between his ruthless murders. Benoit's callous attitude towards his actions and victims makes for endless moments of brilliant black comedy as he speaks openly about the killings with the same indifferent tone he uses to discuss politics or red wine. Each of the performances by the immediate and supporting cast members are 100% authentic, none of which feel staged or scripted even for a moment. This is mainly achieved by filming the actors interacting with their own friends and family on screen in natural social exchanges. Benoit is able to turn on a dime, shifting from the jovial jokester into a cold-blooded killer in seconds. The crew members themselves (who double as the cast) show their understanding of the process through every scene. Seemingly imprecise camera movements and technical errors are meticulously planned in advance to create the illusion of a bumbling group of first-time filmmakers. The rash editing style creates a jarring juxtaposition between the lighthearted scenes in which Benoit shares his personal philosophies and the brutal scenes of extreme violence and gore where he coldly shoots strangers in the head and dumps their bodies into a rock quarry. The documentary style is representative of the media filter that serves to desensitize the audience and allows the violent actions to become acceptable when told through the camera lens. Remy and his crew are able to distance themselves from the events unfolding before them by experiencing the horrors safely through the camera, just as the audience accepts the social terrors as entertainment when told through the film medium. Despite the inevitable conclusions critics will draw based on the voyeuristic depictions of violence, the creators resolve that the film is not a social commentary against violence in the media so much as it is a study of the film making process itself, with the main character and plot being inconsequential to the creative process. Preceding BEHIND THE MASK: THE RISE OF LESLIE VERNON by nearly a decade and a half, this faux documentary is as innovative and original as it is entertaining and well made. It is an important film particularly for aspiring filmmakers that can be equally enjoyed by Horror fans and non-fans alike.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",5,Man Bites Dog,1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,2561,"['Shot', 'gritty', '35mm', 'documentary', 'format', 'MAN', 'BITES', 'DOG', 'film', 'making', 'film', 'charismatic', 'merciless', 'serial', 'killer', 'central', 'focus', 'Independent', 'film', 'crew', 'charming', 'Benoit', 'daily', 'activities', 'waxing', 'intellectual', 'spare', 'moments', 'ruthless', 'murders', 'Benoit', 'callous', 'attitude', 'actions', 'victims', 'endless', 'moments', 'brilliant', 'black', 'comedy', 'openly', 'killings', 'same', 'indifferent', 'tone', 'discuss', 'politics', 'red', 'wine', 'performances', 'immediate', 'supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'are', '100', '%', 'authentic', 'none', 'feel', 'staged', 'scripted', 'even', 'moment', 'mainly', 'achieved', 'filming', 'actors', 'interacting', 'own', 'friends', 'family', 'screen', 'natural', 'social', 'exchanges', 'Benoit', 'able', 'turn', 'dime', 'shifting', 'jovial', 'jokester', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'seconds', 'crew', 'members', 'who', 'double', 'cast', 'show', 'understanding', 'process', 'scene', 'Seemingly', 'imprecise', 'camera', 'movements', 'technical', 'errors', 'are', 'meticulously', 'planned', 'advance', 'create', 'illusion', 'bumbling', 'group', 'first-time', 'filmmakers', 'rash', 'editing', 'style', 'jarring', 'juxtaposition', 'lighthearted', 'scenes', 'Benoit', 'shares', 'personal', 'philosophies', 'brutal', 'scenes', 'extreme', 'violence', 'gore', 'where', 'coldly', 'shoots', 'strangers', 'head', 'dumps', 'bodies', 'rock', 'quarry', 'documentary', 'style', 'representative', 'media', 'filter', 'desensitize', 'audience', 'violent', 'actions', 'become', 'acceptable', 'when', 'told', 'camera', 'Remy', 'crew', 'are', 'able', 'distance', 'events', 'unfolding', 'experiencing', 'horrors', 'safely', 'camera', 'just', 'audience', 'social', 'terrors', 'entertainment', 'when', 'told', 'film', 'medium', 'inevitable', 'conclusions', 'critics', 'will', 'draw', 'based', 'voyeuristic', 'depictions', 'violence', 'creators', 'resolve', 'film', 'not', 'social', 'commentary', 'violence', 'media', 'so', 'much', 'study', 'film', 'making', 'process', 'main', 'character', 'plot', 'being', 'inconsequential', 'creative', 'process', 'Preceding', 'THE', 'MASK', 'RISE', 'OF', 'LESLIE', 'VERNON', 'nearly', 'decade', 'half', 'faux', 'documentary', 'innovative', 'original', 'entertaining', 'well', 'made', 'important', 'film', 'particularly', 'aspiring', 'filmmakers', 'can', 'be', 'equally', 'enjoyed', 'Horror', 'fans', 'non-fans', 'alike.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A
341224,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6302860598,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[0, 4]","The 96 minute film was directed by R&eacute;my Belvaux (who killed himself in 2006) and Andr&eacute; Bonzel, and written by Belvaux, and its frat boy level humor is what ultimately kills the film, and makes it a lesser part of the genre that includes the Christopher Guest mockumentaries. The DVD, by The Criterion Collection, lacks an audio commentary, has a trailer, and a brief interview with the film's three principals. There are also a couple of essays on the film, in the accompanying booklet- one by Bonzel. Given the subject matter, the film would have been more effective as a `straight' mockumentary playing along a Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer Line. As is, the film is just a lower budgeted version of Oliver Stone's hit and miss Natural Born Killers (which, itself, would have worked better had it played things straighter, like Kalifornia). Also, despite being under a hundred minutes, the film loses steam midway through. At an hour, the film would have been far more effective. As it is, the film becomes less of a critique of the media using violence and more of a pornographic pile-on that simply bores. After the tenth body or so there is no horror left, even if anyone had chills to start with. Also, Ben, despite changing his methods of death, is so predictable (each first of the month he kills another mailman) and sloppy (he leaves fingerprints everywhere, that he would never have gotten past three or four victims, tops, much less the dozens he's slaughtered in this film (and the hundreds he likely killed before cameras were rolling). Had the film been a documentary on an unrelated subject and then we slowly got hints of Ben's darker nature, it would have worked much better.The filmmakers countered such criticism by claiming that the film is not about violence, but about the day to day life of anyone, and the main character just happened to be a killer. If that was so, though, then why is the film not about one of the mailmen Ben kills? It could have ended with the murder of the lead character, and been a comment on how easily people accept such violence and death. Thus, the filmmakers' claims are bogus and disingenuous, and merely an attempt to minimize criticisms of technical and structural flaws with the film and screenplay. Technically, too, the film falls into triteness, such as shots of endless running and handheld camera techniques. Yet, the scenes, as such, do not demand the techniques, which are merely low budget razzle-dazzle to pad out the film's length. Another problem the film makes, with its screenplay, is that the people killed can never affect the viewer in a visceral way. They are mere chattel for slaughter, not characters we care of. They are dead setups for Ben's jokes, or less, things to merely get him from point A to point B to propel the putative plot of the film along. In short, there is no heft to the film. It is an occasionally funny film, but it asks no deeper queries of society nor the viewer, and certainly gives no answers. It is an exercise, period. But, one with no possible benefit, since the only answer and reason for the film they can muster is that old Hannah Arendt fallacy: the banality of evil, which is, let's face it, triter than its claim. Benoit, despite the filmmakers' intent, is nothing but a frat boy. He says nothing, does nothing, and there is no logical (even in the film's skewed universe) reason that he should be of interest (unlike, perhaps, the Italian killer he kills, whose alleged Mafia ties end up doing in Ben and the crew).At least in a film like American Psycho, one can gauge the silliness of the cartoon violence by the fact that none of it happened (even within the world of the film); it was all the violent fantasies of the lead character. The faux documentary style of this film does not let the filmmakers that out, and its lack essentially and eventually suffocates the film under its pretenses. Yet, true to its nature, the film never really lets loose in the other direction- in the style of Borat, that it is a comedy, first and foremost, not some deep psychological exploration. Thus, it does not engender enough chills, cogitations, nor guffaws, and remains a gray lumpenmenschen of a film, loaded with potential, but killed by its creators' lack of skill and vision, rather than a rainbow of tears- be they of fear or laughter, the way Charlie Chaplin's underrated Monsieur Verdoux did. It sits on a fence that is none too stylish, and even less effective at achieving its aim. Yet, it is the viewer that gets the splinters.

But like ""Henry,"" it's fascinating.....and certainly different.It is a fake (thank goodness!) documentary with sleazy cameramen following around a serial killer as the latter murders a bunch of people while spouting philosophy between killings. Some of the demented killer's words are downright funny because of their absurdity. Perhaps that is why this is labeled by some as a black comedy, but this is so dark it is difficult for me to rate this as a comedy, even though it's there.Most of the killings are not gruesome but there are a few that qualify for that status. They don't dwell on the blood but they don't spare anything in here, either. This film is so strange, so bizarre that one has to see it believe it. That is not just a clich?. You have not seen a film like this: I guarantee it.A couple of Belgians - Benoit Poelvoorde, Remy Belvaux and Andre Bonzel - did almost all the work on this movie: writing, directing, editing and acting.

341227,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,6302860598,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[33, 43]","Let's get one thing straight right now: look carefully at Criterion's cover picture for ""Man Bites Dog"". Zoom in on it, take your time; I'll wait.Got it? All clear in your mind what the Bad Man with the Gun is doing on the cover? That's right, that's a baby binky flying up out of that cloud of blood and brains and clotted gore.Why a binky? Because I expect the baby was sucking on it before our hero Ben (Benoit Poelvoorde) showed up to do his thing.His thing is killing people: men, women, postal workers, clerks, schoolgirls, elderly women with bad tickers, little kids, entire families. Come to think of it, ""killing"" doesn't get close to describing what Ben does to his victims---I'm thinking 'butcher' is closer to the truth. Anyway, a man's gotta have a hobby, and Ben sticks to what he knows best: slaughtering in pretty much every fashion imaginable.Best of all, ""Man Bites Dog"" charts the rampaging wild rumpus of a whacked-out Belgian killer through the streets, attics, dive bars and country lanes by means of a documentary film crew---complete with narrator, camera-man, and two sound guys!---who follow and film Benoit's every brutal move.Why did I start by asking you to check out the DVD cover art? Because you should know what you're getting into: this is a sick film. This is a warped, deranged, merciless little nugget of pure, horrible filth. If you get offended easily, if you're disturbed by what amounts to a stinking cinematic toilet of human filth and barbarity, if you find yourself saying ""I'm Appalled!"" a lot---trust me, stop reading, and stay far away from ""Man Bites Dog"".Alright, are the Legions of the Appalled gone? Whew, excellent---now we can talk. ""C'est Arrive Pres de Chez Vous"" (which means ""It Happened Close to your House"", bafflingly translated stateside as ""Man Bites Dog""; I don't know, don't ask---but it works) is one of the sickest, bleakest, funniest flicks I have ever seen, and perhaps the only decent thing to come out of Belgium besides the waffles.Originally a student film shot with practically zero budget, ""Man Bites Dog"" astounds on a technical level: the cheap, grainy film and the bumping herky-jerky warzone feel of the photography add to the seamless, searing reality. The film crew that follows our snarky assassin around is the actual film crew that masterminded this brutal nugget of horror: director Remy Belvaux (Remy the reporter), director of photography Andre Bonzel (Andre the Cameraman)---even trigger-man Benoit worked on the screenplay.We don't exactly know what Ben is, or how he makes his money and gets around: is he an assassin, petty criminal, mass murderer, happy sadist, philosopher? Does he do contract killing, or just slaughter people for sh*ts, giggles, and money?The point seems to be: who knows? Who cares? Who says there has to be a reason? In the meantime:*MARVEL as Ben regales his film crew with his thoughts on art, architecture, music, and social justice! Take a jaunt with him to hear his favorite floutist Jenny (Jenny Drye, who suffers a fate that shouldn't happen to a dog)show off her pipes!*SWOON as Ben demonstrates: the best way to suffocate a victim with a plastic bag! PLUS---how to get rid of those pesky bodies using a tarp, a little rope, and a handy drainage ditch!*EMPATHIZE as Ben complains about the lack of good help in holding down a potential victim these days, lecturing his film crew about the one that got away!*APPROVE as Ben hangs wif da homeyz and accepts no sh*t on his birthday. Admit it: in his shoes, you'd do the same.*SING with Benny as he shows off his singing voice after getting thrown out of a bar! See if you're not crooning ""CINEMA! CINEMAAAAA!"" long after the credits roll.LAUGH as Ben and his film crew run into another serial killer---followed about by his *own* documentary film crew! Bullets fly, celluloid rolls!Some reviewers try to gussy this thing up as an ""astute social commentary"". Come on. ""Man Bites Dog"" is divinely inspired, and it is what it is: it is honest, brutal, deadly, black gleeful fun. ""Man Bites Dog""---I'll be honest---is terrible, perhaps, but it is also liberating.There is something in many of us---perhaps most of us---that languishes beneath the shackles of our politically correct high-minded Republic of Nice (the bane and curse of 21st century democracies, where everyone takes pains not to offend)---something that longs for firebombs, and midnight massacres, and death squads: rapine, torture, carnage on a massive scale. I'm not saying that's not demonic, but the truth is---that Demon lurks in all of us. ""Man Bites Dog"" opens up the pen and slips the collar off for 90 minutes.You'll laugh; maybe, if you're still human, you'll feel guilty about it afterwards (I didn't, but I'm a jaded creature). Ben is trenchant, witty, funny, totally loyal to his friends and devoted to his parents. He is, in his own warped way, considerably moral. He just happens to have shifted left where many of us shimmied right, and kills people for amusement, mega-bucks, and GREAT door prizes!Whatever: see it. You'll find it is entirely possible to be deeply morally offended *and* laugh like a madman.JSG",5,Darling I don't know why I go to Extremes,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,5159,"['Let', 'get', 'one',

In this case many reviewers appear to have missed it as well.Spoiler: Story revolves around a serial killer, and the celebration of the killer by the media. A film crew accompanies him, documents his crimes for later publication. When they run short of funds, he goes on a killing spree to generate money for his own biography. When the film crew get killed in their pursuit of the story, everything moves on without skipping a beat.It's actually quite a humorous concept: the photographer is shot and rather than call for help, the faux director picks up the camera and continues filming. The mockery of the media in it's celebration of violation (through visual depiction of the violence) is effective material. But instead of a too-hard punch in the shoulder, the point is driven like a dagger to a vital organ. Viewers are mainly so offended they lack the perspective to realize the comedy within the tragedy.If you choose to watch this film, do so realizing that it mocks serial killer sand the media for celebrating them; it's not actually a celebration of the violence.

341230,A36L1F0YECOAW8,6302860598,David Grant,"[6, 9]","'Man Bites Dog' is certainly one of those films that isn't for everyone. Teetering far too often between comedy and horror, the film always walks a hair-thin line between tongue-in-cheek satire and dangerously violent social statement. The 'faux-documentary' look of the film adds far too much realism to the film at times, making it uncomfortable and sickening to watch. It also brings us way too close to a 'professional' serial killer / thief who would be so disgusting, were he not so amusing and charming. The nonchalant way in which he discusses the proper way to dispose of a corpse in a body of water (turning the gruesome practice into a simple standard equation) is enough to chill us to the bone were it not utterly fascinating and so damned bizarre. The camera crew that follows this murderer on his day-to-day rituals slowly becomes accomplices, helping to dispose of the bodies and, after stumbling upon a simliar filmcrew shooting their own documentary on a serial killer, sometimes helping him to knock a few people off. In fact the film challenges us to NOT LIKE it's subject, marking that evil lives and breathes behind even the most charming of smiles and healthiest laugh. Like the documentary crew, we are too fascinated by this man and the closer we come to him, the more we begin to think like him and cheer him on. It's this slow progression from simply being voyeurs to being allies that makes the film so chilling. When it finally reaches it's shocking, violent conclusion, we are drained. The film is like a roller coaster of emotional imput, screaming one second, laughter the next. And so convincing is the documentary look and feel (and amazing performances) that often times you will have to fall back behind that age old mantra of protection from what is on the screen... 'it's only a movie... it's only a movie'. This is powerful cinema, and not to be viewed by anyone without a strong stomach.

But this film is far from providing any useful commentary on these far reaching and noble subjects. It was just a poorly made and poorly written series of disjointed scenes. The director was trying to intertwine his social theories into the dialogue. So maybe it was lost in translation. But whatever the case, the film did not live up to its billing. If you want satire, try Kubrick. If you want a low budget blood bath try Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1973). And if you want a bloodbath with social commentary, try American Psycho.

Though its content is shocking to say the least, the overall effect is a startlingly satirical look at the media's fascination at peering from the safety of our collective couches at the levels of violence that run rampant in television.An extremely tight budgeted camera crew follow a poetry spouting serial killer through the streets of Belgium in a quasi-documentary.  Adhering initially to the unofficial press ""rule"" of not interfereing with the outcome of events, they capture the horrific details of Benoit's bloodlust, which can only be equalled with the evident psychosis in his mind as He swings from controlled to chaotic.  Ben is an interesting soul- friendly, charismatic and intelligent- which provides a pleasant yet disturbing contrast to the depravity of his actions.  What gives MBD that extra degree of cinematic edge is the interviews with the crew and cast (all of which coincindently use their real names in the movie, adding a greater sense of realism)...where they argue about costs, running out of equipment and film, again spurring on the documentary feel on a fictional film.  When the line is crossed by the crew from neutral observers to participants, they follow the same overall repercussions as our diabolical hero.Based on Criterion's history of giving beautiful transfers, I will be optimistic that MBD will recieve the similar royal treatment.  Past VHS copies had both the Unrated Cut (which was missing the gruesome scene of Ben strangling a young boy) and the Unrated Director's Cut (aforementioned scene intact).  From what I've heard, the DVD will be the unedited version.  This important movie's message has become even more potent as the demand for ""reality"" shows has risen to ludicrous levels.

341235,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,6302860598,General Zombie,"[0, 0]","Unsurprisingly people, different people take this film very different ways.  Personally, I take this almost exclusively as a black comedy.  People like to talk about satire and condemning the media and the audience and whoever, but I'm not particularly interested in this.  Frankly, I'm never all that interested in themes. Also, when people say that this is a condemnation of the media and the audience and everyone, they're flatout wrong.  In the notes to the DVD co-director/writer Andre Bonzel says: `More than any statement on violence-as some people have seen it, and which was never our intention- `Man Bites Dog is just a film about...filmmaking.'  Which shows a different light: the film is not about us, nor is it about Benoit. It's about Remy and his crew, who will go through anything and do anything to get their film made, much like the real filmmakers.  Also, though it's definitely violent, the violence is a necessary element of the humor of the film, not a way of defusing it or distancing us from it.  In fact, the violence is the heart of the comedy, and when they get too far from it for too long, the film suffers some.  But, you'll just have to see it yourself if you really wanna know what you're gonna make of it.As a mock documentary, the film has no real plot, as it largely is just the crew following around Benoit, a professional killer.  And yes, as others have mentioned, it is fairly one note, but they play it well.  The basic joke is that there is a bloodthirsty murderer who is also a pseudo-intellectual, pompous and rather geeky looking dude who is vaguely endearing, and certainly not even remotely threatening seeming.  He's a dilettante with aristocratic pretensions, interested in the arts, architecture, poetry and whatnot, and also a bit vulgar and casually bigoted, if in a benign way.  He's very clearly drawn, and how or why he became a killer is very tough to say.  Related to this, the humor in the film comes from how casually the violence occurs.  I said he's a 'professional killer', but he's not a hitman, or even a serial killer, in the conventional sense.  Killing people is just what he does, and how he pays his bills, and he approaches it the way most people would approach their job.  It's a simple comedic method, but it's pretty hilarious much of the time, most notably in the opening scenes of the film, where, just after strangling a woman, Ben offhandedly expounds upon how to ballast a corpse so that it will stay down, and then on how he picks victims. (He prefers the old, as they're always loaded.  No young couples, as they reek of poverty)  Occasionally, the film can be really charmingly outrageous, again, due to the casual approach towards the material, such as how Ben calmly discusses why he rarely murders children,(they're not bankable) while he's suffocating a kid under a pillow.  Again, there isn't all that much to the joke, but the filmmakers are clever and write fine dialogue, so it carries the film fine.  Still, it could stand to be a bit shorter.  They easily could've, and should've shorn maybe 10 total minutes from throughout the film without losing anything particularly interesting. (Most notably, the scene involving Ben's hospital room companion shoulda been cut, and some of their getting drunk prior to the rape scene could've been trimmed.)  It's never totally flat, and never for very long,  but it still could've been tighter and sharper.The film is shot in black and white, in your standard pseudo-documentary style with lotsa camera movement.  The pseudo-documentary aspect are, of course, key to the humor, and add an air of realism to the fundamentally nutty core of the film.Reading these negative reviews can often be funny.  Ya don't think fictional murder should be used for humorous purposes?  Well, then maybe *you* shouldn't be watching NC-17 rated black comedies about career killers.  On that note, though the film is graphically violent, it's really not very gory, so don't get your hopes up in that aspect.  It probably got that rating more for thematic, tonal reasons rather than for gruesomeness.  That, and despite what you may have heard, the rape scene is fairly tame.  The sorta viewer who would be interested in this movie would most likely have seen a lot worse else where.The Criterion DVD is pretty nice, with fine packaging, excellent subtitles and a good transfer. (Course, the film doesn't look terribly nice, but that's intentional)  And contrary to what some will tell you, it isn't cut.  (Yeah, the Criterion people are gonna release a cut film...)  Also, it's not as outrageously expensive as some of their DVDs.Well, I think this is a rather remarkable film.

And by ""love cinema,"" I don't mean if you're the kind of person who loves going to the movies, or loves renting DVDs.  What I mean is...completely, obsessively in love with the medium of cinema.  If this describes you, and you've not yet seen this film...see it now.  You'll need a strong constitution...but if you truly love cinema, then you must love it for all of its ugliness...not just its beauty...so it should go without saying that you aren't squeamish.The following review may contain spoilers...so be forewarned.C'est Arriv&eacute; Pr&egrave;s de Chez Vous is an amazing film...an unflichingly dark satire on the media's obsession with violence and mayhem.  Natural Born Killers covers much the same territory, but in a much more psychedelic way...thus removing it from the realm of the reality it lampoons.  The line that separates this Belgian gem from reality, however, is razor thin.  It presents itself as a documentary about the daily life of a serial killer.  The members of the film crew (as is often the case with real documentaries) appear on-screen and participate, by escalating degrees, in what is happening.  The film is also shot documentary-style, handheld, in high contrast black and white, giving it the feel of an authentic low budget documentary.Initially, it draws you in as a black comedy.  The murders may be gruesome, but Ben (the killer) is affable and very chatty...discussing his methods in such a humorous way that it somewhat defuses the violence that we see.  The situations are often very funny, and at least somewhat removed from reality, in a satirical sense.  Then, once we're well into the film, we are presented with a rape scene...and there is absolutely nothing that is even remotely funny about it.  The scene is played straight, and it is highly disturbing.  By this time, Ben's crew has been converted...they are no longer objective observers, but have begun to participate in his spree.  After Ben rapes the woman, each member of the crew takes his turn, as well.  Then (naturally) she is murdered.This deserves explanation, as it is the scene that has garnered the most criticism toward this film.  In America, it was even cut out of most home video versions.  But it is the single most important scene in the film...because we, as an audience, are suddenly shocked back into a sense of moral reality by this scene.  We aren't laughing anymore.  And we begin to think back to all the other times, when we DID laugh.  And now, we feel dirty.  We feel the voyeuristic shame that we SHOULD feel...the same voyeuristic shame that people obsessed with ""reality TV"" should feel.  It's a very risky move on the part of the filmmakers, because it forces the audience to feel what they do not want to feel, and to recognize their own culpability...but it is also the defining moment in the film.  Without it, the satire loses its punch...we need the resounding clarity that our revulsion provides, because it hammers home the film's underlying message.  For as much outrage as the scene has caused, it is absolutely vital.  I have seen the film without it, and it's a completely different movie.

341237,A2C5LA07JCDWTN,6302860598,"J. Brittman ""The Bottom Line""","[0, 0]","A classic line from a classic film.  Man Bites Dog is a mock documentary that follows the life of serial killer Benoit.  What makes Man Bites Dog stand out amongst other mockumentaries is the inherently human side of Benoit that is portrayed when he is not killing.  Benoit is an intelligent, well-liked, and well-adjusted murderer.  He has a family that loves him and friends that care about him.  Remy heads the film crew who follows Benoit on his crimes and in some cases aid him in disposing of the bodies.  The violence in Man Bites Dog is brilliantly interspersed between very normal scenes.  For example, Benoit's birthday party; he just gets released from the hospital and is enjoying cake with his friends and the film crew when he hears one of his male friends make a joke about him.  The party continues and Benoit receives a holster as a gift from the film crew.  Benoit remarks how much he likes the gift and then calls for his gun.  He practices taking the gun in and out of the holster and suddenly shoots his male friend dead.  No one says a word, no one screams.  Benoit's two female friends are covered in blood but continue to eat their cake and shower gifts upon him.  The reactions of the film crew are funny, especially Remy who is obviously both scared and attracted to Benoit as a powerful central figure.  The violence is not as shocking as I thought it would be, but there is still a fair amount of gunplay, murder, and strangulations to disturb any viewer.  One particular scene sticks in my mind with the old woman who he scares to death, literally.  Man Bites Dog is challenging but rewarding fare, disturbing yet vital.  Benoit is the ultimate anti-hero, he is sick and sadistic, yet he also cares for certain people and about certain social problems.  Benoit is truly an enigma that will captivate your attention right up until the end of this film.

341238,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,6302860598,Jeffrey Leach,"[48, 55]","The Criterion Collection brings film lovers some of the most engaging, challenging pictures ever made. National borders mean little to the folks at this DVD company; they will release American films as readily as they will European cinema or documentaries about African dictators. Moreover, Criterion does not flinch from controversial films because they contain controversial themes. Thanks to this company, we can readily obtain excellent versions of Paul Morrissey's &quot;Flesh for Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Blood for Dracula&quot; along with the ultra violent &quot;Robocop.&quot; I have yet to fully explore the depths of Criterion's film catalog, but their other discs must surely be as interesting as the titles I have viewed so far. Criterion finally released one of my favorite foreign films, the independent little gem entitled &quot;C'est Arrive Pres de Chez Vous,&quot; oddly translated as &quot;Man Bites Dog.&quot; Made in Belgium a little over a decade ago, this fascinating movie viciously satirizes the media and its love for dramatic violence. Criterion not only presents this movie with a heap of extras, they also restored the film to its uncut form. This is important because the version I watched nearly ten years ago was missing two scenes that are arguably the most shocking parts in the entire film.Filmed entirely in the style of a black and white documentary, &quot;Man Bites Dog&quot; is an often outrageous excursion into the underground world of a sadistic thug named Benoit, a travelogue of the daily activities and random thoughts of a bloodthirsty sociopath. Most of the time he robs the elderly of their pensions, commits burglaries, drinks himself silly, or kills innocent people for no other reason than that he feels like it. In several scenes we see Ben instructing the film crew on how to weigh down bodies so they will not float when he dumps the corpses into an abandoned rock quarry. His associates are mostly a rather seedy lot: he often visits an aging woman of questionable virtue and hangs out with an obnoxious boxer. Good old Benny is not above suddenly killing a pal in a fit of rage, or giving an old woman a fatal heart attack by screaming at the top of his lungs into her face. This guy is a piece of work, but what truly makes the film painful to watch is how Benoit gradually lures the filmmakers into sharing his gruesome crimes.In a way, and this is the real genius of &quot;Man Bites Dog,&quot; the viewer can sometimes understand why the documentarians become involved in Benoit's shenanigans. Even as he commits the most despicable of crimes, this hooligan is truly a charming character with many endearing traits. He often waxes philosophic about such disparate topics as architecture and poetry, has a lady friend who takes him to art galleries, and his generosity to the filmmakers chronicling his life knows no bounds. Benny is always willing to buy a drink or pitch in to help pay for more film because he enjoys the company of his newfound buddies. Watching this guy play with children in the street even though he committed an atrocious crime against a youth in another scene presents the documentarians, and by extension the viewer, with a moral quandary not easily resolved. Benoit does not represent what Hannah Arendt referred to as the &quot;banality of evil&quot; but rather an &quot;ambiguity of evil,&quot; and it makes pigeonholing this character at times extremely problematic. To make it even more difficult for the viewer to hate Benoit, his likeable mother and grandfather appear from time to time. But abhor him you will, especially after seeing the aftermath of a robbery in the suburbs and an encounter with a couple in an apartment after an all-night drunk. &quot;Man Bites Dog&quot; is a challenging film.Even worse, this movie is often quite funny in the way only the blackest of comedies can achieve. Benoit's overdramatic French dialogue is a scream, and many of his views on life are just downright hysterical. You cannot help but laugh when Benoit forces the camera crew to rebury bodies that have suddenly reappeared when the quarry goes dry. I think one of the funniest scenes in the movie occurs when a member of the documentary crew dies as a result of Benoit's activities and we see a member of the crew eulogize him on camera. When another filmmaker dies later in the film, this same guy performs another eulogy nearly indistinguishable from the first one. I have never felt as guilty about laughing during a film as I have with this one because I knew I just should not, could not, dared not find this amusing, but in the end I just could not help myself from giggling over Ben's antics.The extras on the Criterion disc are not all that impressive. There is a film short starring the actor who played Benoit that is not that good, an interview with the filmmakers that is rather short and does not reveal much about the film, a still gallery, and some reviews concerning the movie. The transfer quality of the picture is excellent, though, as are the subtitles for this French language film. As far as I know, we have never seen anything further from the people responsible for &quot;Man Bites Dog.&quot; Perhaps these guys were one hit wonders, and if so that is a darn shame. This movie is so brilliantly conceived and executed that it is difficult to imagine that whoever made it would slide into obscurity.",5,Depraved Low Budget Shocker,1069545600,"11 23,

That may sound like a description of &quot;Mr Hulot's  Holiday&quot; but it also sums up &quot;Man Bites Dog&quot;.The film  follows the exploits of Benoit, a serial killer. It is his vocation and he  takes it seriously indeed. Serious, not just about killing individuals but  about being a serial killer. He is aware of his filmers and, on occasion,  plays up to the camera. We see him commit a number of gruesome killings and  dispose of the bodies of his victims. Gradually, the film makers become  dragged into his crimes and finally, they are fully fledged  accomplices.Some people have ascribed motivations and meanings to this  film as being a comment on the way in which the media fixates on and lauds  some violent criminals. I cannot agree with this. The film was made as a  student project and with no expectation that it would be viewed outside its  immediate academic environment. It is perhaps unconstrained by the  expectation that it would be widely exhibited.There is a lot of violence  in this movie. Explicit, gratuitous and, on occasion, sexual. At the same  time, there is a lot of, albeit very dark, humour.

341242,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,6302860598,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","This brutal, nasty and hilarious shocker is one of my favorite international films. I check it out every couple of years and it never fails to delight and horrify me. It's particularly interesting that ""Man Bites Dog"" was made in 1992, which predates the reality craze/glut of the last half dozen years. I'd say it's an even more relevant film now in an era where everything is broadcast, where much of TV has been developed for the lowest common denominator. Reality stars don't represent reality, they are enacting whatever necessary to ensure another 15 minutes of fame.The antihero of ""Man Bites Dog"" is the sociopathic Ben. He is super entertaining, humorous and well spoken despite being a vicious criminal. Robbery, sexual assault, murder: no type of violence is too uninteresting for our Ben. Thus, we have a documentary team who take Ben on as their project, I suppose to gain insight into the criminal mind. And so Ben is constantly interviewed and his actions caught on film. Not only does Ben relish this attention, he starts to go further and further to make more interesting material!What's so daring about ""Man Bites Dog"" is that the amorality becomes an enticement for the documentarians who become complicit in the crimes. A life like Ben's, however sadistic, is a free one. And let me tell you, this film pushes the boundaries of good taste. It seeks to shock us, as Ben seeks to shock us, as the film/TV media seek to shock us. It is a constant game of one-ups-manship.This film is a bold, unsettling and surprisingly timely social commentary. It is loaded with whacked out violence and grotesque imagery. But what I've only alluded is that this is a COMEDY. Not for the faint of heart, if what I've said already sounds too strong for you, don't check this out for the humor.

The story seems to be rather absurd as the audience views Benoit's random acts of violence. However, in between the violence the audience can meet Benoit's parents and friends while listening to his slanted life philosophy.  Nonetheless, the main point of the film remains, which is to figure out reasons for the violence.  At the end the audience is left with the notion of &quot;why&quot;?",4,Ballast for a dead person is 3 times its weight...,1033084800,"09 27, 2002",2002,588,"['Man', 'Dog', 'serial', 'killer', 'Benoit', 'light', 'reporter', 'eyes', 'camera', 'man', 'ears', 'sound', 'man', 'who', 'are', 'making', 'documentary', 'Benoit', 'violent', 'life', 'story', 'be', 'rather', 'absurd', 'audience', 'Benoit', 'random', 'acts', 'violence', 'However', 'violence', 'audience', 'can', 'meet', 'Benoit', 'parents', 'friends', 'listening', 'slanted', 'life', 'philosophy', 'Nonetheless', 'main', 'point', 'film', 'figure', 'out', 'reasons', 'violence', 'end', 'audience', 'left', 'notion', 'quot', 'why', 'quot']",N/A
341244,A2ICI500LRO01K,6302860598,Kyle Wells,"[0, 0]","The premise and point of ""Man Bites Dog"" is rather simple when you think about it. It takes a grand total of about five minutes to pass before you `get it'. ""Oh, it's like ""This is Spinal Tap!"" meets ""A Clockwork Orange,"" you'll say. But, of course, it's often the simple ideas that have the greatest impact, and if there is one ingredient not lacking in ""Man Bites Dog"" it is impact. The film is as shocking, intense, and disturbing as many have described it. It is also hilarious. And it is this combination that allows the films its greatest effect. We laugh at the film and the ridiculous characters and then in the same breath recoil at horrific scenes of violence and trauma. The film uses this disorienting effect for the point of criticism, even accusation, but tries itself to be clever and calculating enough to avoid its own critique. In some ways it succeeds, indicting the very material it presents; in others it is a little smart for its own good. But for whatever shortcomings the film may have, it is an experience between audience and screen that is not easily dismissed and even more stubborn to accept.So what is this strange Belgian film anyways? Well it's a fake documentary, of sorts, about a serial killer. Much like other mockumentaries the filmmakers are characters themselves and the footage is presented as if fact. The subject of the film is  , a loud, brash, talkative fellow; a bit of a loser but admirable in spirits.  spends his days dining, reciting poetry, visiting family, and brutally murdering children, the elderly, postmen, and anyone else in the wrong place at the wrong time. Why he does this is not abundantly clear. It is not for profit, and his casual attitude towards his crimes suggests an absence of pure psychotic pleasure. He is more just a bit of a goof, a man desperate for exposure, an addict of extreme living in all manners, including the elimination of it. He seems to do what he does more for recognition than for his own pleasure, and the contact between himself and the filmmakers' camera is far more important then that between him and his victims. He is the killer that we the audiences and they the mediators have come to create and love: a man unspoiled by guilt and unbound by society. We laugh at his ridiculousness but respond to his exuberance. He is the Paris Hilton of the crime world.So that's step one: present a character both hilarious and enjoyable, a true `personality'. Step two is to make him perform the most horrific acts one can imagine. The very first image of the film is him slowly strangling a woman to death with wire. He shoots people, beats others to death, rapes, tortures, and maims. And all is shown in graphic detail by an unflinching camera. These images in the film are shockingly explicit and frank, the type that do not escape the mind easily. They juxtapose the comedy of the film, and it is this combination, this uneasy blend, that makes the film so disturbing. We find ourselves laughing at and enjoying the charisma of a man who is nothing short of a monster. We are identifying with the devil himself. A sense of imbalance is aroused from this; a disorienting experience emerges, of the type only the best of challenging filmmaking can produce. It becomes not only the content that disturbs, but the form as well, and in a far subtler, ultimately more effective way.Ideally the greatest shock should come from our own reaction to the film. I was captivated by all his excesses, even those of violence. I found myself getting slightly bored between murders, and hoping for the film to go further. And when it did, I was repulsed yet again. And then wanted more. The characters of the filmmakers are perhaps the most important in the film. They begin as disgusted observers to start, but soon become more and more involved in the chaos. They become addicted to the thrill, the recklessness, the exposure. The western world celebrates greatness in any field, for any activity, so long as it is pushing boundaries and breaking records. The celebrity culture surrounding serial killers is perhaps the most telling of our obsessions. People buy serial killer memorabilia. We watch countless films of murder and are disappointed when they stop short of our bloody hopes. ""Man Bites Dog"" succeeds by never stopping short and rubbing it in our faces. We want the mayhem, the excessive violence and gore, and when they deliver we become ashamed. Or at least should.This is a film made with a purpose, designed to carefully extract certain reactions from its viewers. It makes its point through manipulation. This can make it hard to watch, but it is also what makes the film great. It is at times a bit to proud of its own craftiness and flaunts its self-awareness haphazardly, but generally its attempts at confrontation are successful. You may go away from the film unable to rid your mind of its horrific imagery. And you may question your own desire to see that imagery, and your reaction to this charming man. This is the intention of the film, and really the filmmakers themselves would probably be the first to admit that it is too violent, too cold...that is after all the point.",4,Horrific and Hilarious,1165968000,"12 13, 2006",2006,5177,"['premise', 'point', 'Man', 'Dog', 'rather', 'simple', 'when', 'think', 'grand', 'total', 'five', 'minutes', 'pass', 'get', 'Oh', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', ""'ll"", 'say', 'course', 'often', 'simple', 'ideas', 'have', 'greatest', 'impact', 'one', 'ingredient', 'not', 'lacking', 'Man', 'Dog', 'impact', 'film', 'shocking', 'intense', 'disturbing', 'as', 'many', 'have', 'described', 'also', 'hilarious', 'combination', 'films', 'greatest', 'effect', 'laugh', 'film', 'ridiculous', 'characters', 'then', 'same', 'breath', 'recoil', 'horrific', 'scenes', 'violence', 'trauma', 'film', 'disorienting', 'effect', 'point', 'criticism', 'even', 'accusation', 'be', 'clever', 'calculating', 'enough', 'avoid', 'own', 'critique', 'ways', 'indicting', 'very', 'material', 'others', 'little', 'smart', 'own', 'good', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'experience', 'audience', 'screen', 'not', 'easily', 'dismissed', 'even', 'more', 'stubborn', 'accept.So', 'what', 'strange', 'Belgian', 'film', 'anyways', 'Well', 'fake', 'documentary', 'sorts', 'serial', 'killer', 'Much', 'other', 'mockumentaries', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'characters', 'footage', 'presented', 'fact', 'subject', 'film', 'loud', 'brash', 'talkative', 'fellow', 'bit', 'loser', 'admirable', 'spirits', 'days', 'dining', 'reciting', 'poetry', 'visiting', 'family', 'brutally', 'murdering', 'children', 'elderly', 'postmen', 'anyone', 'else', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'Why', 'not', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'not', 'profit', 'casual', 'attitude', 'crimes', 'absence', 'pure', 'psychotic', 'pleasure', 'more', 'just', 'bit', 'goof', 'man', 'desperate', 'exposure', 'addict', 'extreme', 'living', 'manners', 'including', 'elimination', 'do', 'what', 'more', 'recognition', 'own', 'pleasure', 'contact', 'filmmakers', 'camera', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'then', 'victims', 'killer', 'audiences', 'mediators', 'have', 'come', 'create', 'love', 'man', 'unspoiled', 'guilt', 'unbound', 'society', 'laugh', 'ridiculousness', 'respond', 'exuberance', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'crime', 'world.So', 'step', 'one', 'present', 'character', 'hilarious', 'enjoyable', 'true', 'personality', 'Step', 'two', 'make', 'perform', 'most', 'horrific', 'acts', 'one', 'can', 'imagine', 'very', 'first', 'image', 'film', 'slowly', 'strangling', 'woman', 'death', 'wire', 'people', 'others', 'death', 'rapes', 'tortures', 'maims', 'shown', 'graphic', 'detail', 'unflinching', 'camera', 'images', 'film', 'are', 'shockingly', 'explicit', 'frank', 'type', 'do', 'not', 'escape', 'mind', 'easily', 'juxtapose', 'comedy', 'film', 'combination', 'uneasy', 'blend', 'film', 'so', 'disturbing', 'find', 'laughing', 'enjoying', 'charisma', 'man', 'who', 'nothing', 'short', 'monster', 'are', 'identifying', 'devil', 'sense', 'imbalance', 'aroused', 'disorienting', 'experience', 'emerges', 'type', 'only', 'best', 'challenging', 'filmmaking', 'can', 'produce', 'not', 'only', 'content', 'form', 'as', 'well', 'far', 'subtler', 'ultimately', 'more', 'effective', 'way.Ideally', 'greatest', 'shock', 'should', 'come', 'own', 'reaction', 'film', 'was', 'captivated', 'excesses', 'even', 'violence', 'found', 'getting', 'slightly', 'bored', 'murders', 'hoping', 'film', 'go', 'further', 'when', 'did', 'was', 'repulsed', 'yet', 'again', 'then', 'wanted', 'more', 'characters', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'perhaps', 'most', 'important', 'film', 'begin', 'disgusted', 'observers', 'start', 'soon', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'involved', 'chaos', 'become', 'addicted', 'thrill', 'recklessness', 'exposure', 'western', 'world', 'greatness', 'field', 'activity', 'so', 'long', 'pushing', 'boundaries', 'breaking', 'records', 'celebrity', 'culture', 'surrounding', 'serial', 'killers', 'perhaps', 'most', 'telling', 'obsessions', 'People', 'buy', 'serial', 'killer', 'memorabilia', 'watch', 'countless', 'films', 'murder', 'are', 'disappointed', 'when', 'stop', 'short', 'bloody', 'Man', 'Dog', 'never', 'stopping', 'short', 'rubbing', 'want', 'mayhem', 'excessive', 'violence', 'gore', 'when', 'deliver', 'become', 'ashamed', 'least', 'should.This', 'film', 'made', 'purpose', 'designed', 'carefully', 'extract', 'certain', 'reactions', 'viewers', 'point', 'manipulation', 'can', 'make', 'hard', 'watch', 'also', 'what', 'film', 'great', 'times', 'bit', 'proud', 'own', 'craftiness', 'self-awareness', 'haphazardly', 'generally', 'attempts', 'confrontation', 'are', 'successful', 'may', 'go', 'away', 'film', 'unable', 'rid', 'mind', 'horrific', 'imagery', 'may', 'question', 'own', 'desire', 'see', 'imagery', 'reaction', 'charming', 'man', 'intention', 'film', 'really', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'too', 'violent', 'too', 'cold', 'point']",N/A
341245,ASHBFCUZAYCS4,6302860598,"Lord Schitsdain ""The sage of rage""","[1, 2]","I was initially disturbed by the violence at the start of this film, until the killer started describing his formula for adding ballast to dead bodies to keep them from floating to the surface, and mentioned children and midgets. Midgets? Just how many midgets has this guy killed? Seeing that it was going to be a satire, I was able to unclench and go along for the ride. It turned out to be a pretty good ride, burdening me with guilt for actually laughing. I thought the humor and social commentary was actually pretty clever. The killer, with all the tact of Borat, touches on a number of social issues like racial stereotypes and homosexuality as he goes about his chosen ""vocation"", which he has down to a science. I think the biggest satirical jab may be directed at the filmmakers themselves, as we see the depths to which they will sink in their desperate desire to make their first film and run out of money. The killer basically becomes the producer, and the filmmakers his accomplaces. At one point they encounter another film crew following the exploits of another killer. These guys are not Auteurs filming on black and white 16mm, they are voyeurs filming on video tape. Video tape, indeed. Off with their heads! While this is probably the darkest of dark comedies that I have seen, the surreal ridiculousness of some of the scenes tempered the violence and made it a very watchable movie.

I've heard a lot of critics try to attribute some sort of social commentary to it to justify their love of this movie.  In truth, &quot;Man Bites Dog&quot; is only a black comedy.  No pertinent social or psychological implications, no lampooning of sacred cows, just a simple comedy that happens to have a serial killer as its protagonist.Shot in black &amp; white this mocumentary-style comedy treads ground where few others have dared and fewer still have done so with as much intelligence as Belvaux and Poelvoorde.  &quot;Man Bites Dog&quot; showcases some of the most genuinely shocking moments ever committed to film and presents them in a very matter-of-fact deadpan style.  Some may find this to be the most disturbing part of this film, even more so than the acts themselves.Along with having the honor of being one of the most unrepentantly brutal films of all time it also provides more than its fair share of hysterically funny moments.  A perfect example of this is when Ben's film crew runs into some friends of theirs who happen to be documenting a rival serial killer. It's classically comedic moments like these that make this such an incredible film.In short, &quot;Man Bites Dog&quot; has the distinction of being one of only a handful of intelligently written films of this sort.

It involves a film crew that follow a serial killer (Benoit Poelvoorde) and gradually become implicated in his crimes as they start to aid him in escape and even in the acts themselves.There's a great deal here to admire, not least its satire on the media fascination with violence.  Filmed in the style of a true-life documentary it is very close to the bone.  Whilst it's true that several of its scenes are shocking beyond belief, it's rare to find something which consistently attacks its audience with such vigour.  As the makers of Benoit's film go in front of the screen more and more before finally succumbing to his hideous seduction the audience not only question the morals of those partaking in the acts but also themselves for watching it.My only real criticism is that despite being very well acted indeed we're never quite convinced that this is real.

It is true that once you witness Irreversible this one just looses a lot of its impact. It once could be deemed worthy of its deserving five stars, but many acknowledge that this was because it held the #1 shocker place on the art-house list. Now that has been eclipsed, this piece of cinema simply looses a star. It just doesn't shock like it used too.A year before Oliver Stone would work a similar theme, Belgian filmmakers had decided to come up with a horrific satire to pay homage to the world's media allure towards nasty violent news stories. Here a documentary team of filmmakers follow a serial killer around Belgium as he offs his victims in the most awful of ways imaginable (or at least they used to be the most awful of ways imaginable).... and then the thin red line between investigative reporting becomes aiding and abetting and then blurs even more into full out participation.It is still a great film and certainly has a vigorous message that still stands today ten years later, maybe even more so than ever, but it is no longer THE art-house shocker - just second place at best.",4,Tamed by other beasts,1073520000,"01 8, 2004",2004,1335,"['day', 'was', 'ruling', 'champ', 'gritty', 'art-house', 'cinema', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'Gasper', 'Noe', 'latest', 'opus', 'equal', 'horrors', 'Irreversible-', 'pretty', 'much', 'ripped', 'impact', 'little', 'gem', 'starting', 'up', 'lawnmower', 'true', 'once', 'witness', 'Irreversible', 'one', 'just', 'lot', 'impact', 'once', 'could', 'be', 'deemed', 'worthy', 'deserving', 'five', 'stars', 'many', 'acknowledge', 'was', 'held', '1', 'shocker', 'place', 'art-house', 'list', 'Now', 'been', 'eclipsed', 'piece', 'cinema', 'simply', 'star', 'just', ""n't"", 'shock', 'used', 'too.A', 'year', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'would', 'work', 'similar', 'theme', 'Belgian', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'decided', 'come', 'up', 'horrific', 'satire', 'pay', 'homage', 'world', 'media', 'allure', 'towards', 'nasty', 'violent', 'news', 'stories', 'Here', 'documentary', 'team', 'filmmakers', 'follow', 'serial', 'killer', 'around', 'Belgium', 'victims', 'most', 'awful', 'ways', 'imaginable', 'least', 'used', 'be', 'most', 'awful', 'ways', 'imaginable', 'then', 'thin', 'red', 'line', 'investigative', 'reporting', 'becomes', 'aiding', 'abetting', 'then', 'blurs', 'even', 'more', 'full', 'participation.It', 'still', 'great', 'film', 'certainly', 'vigorous', 'message', 'still', 'today', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'ever', 'no', 'longer', 'THE', 'art-house', 'shocker', 'just', 'second', 'place', 'best']",N/A
341253,A2QDSG599HSWVA,6302860598,Patrick Wilkinson,"[3, 4]","A dark surreal horror comedy mockumentary. Yep, that about sums it up! ""Man Bites Dog"" takes the black comedy genre and hits it with the gore stick. Shot in black and white, this movie (as with most I review) is not for everyone. Some may say this is not a black comedy but a truly disgusting horror film. I would say they are half right. MBD doesn't hold back on what it shows, including a nasty gang rape scene. However; underneath the gruesome images and complete lack of moral fiber from the main character, ""Ben"" played by Benot Poelvoorde, this movie has some really hilarious parts. For me this is a black comedy with some genuine horror mixed in.""Ben"", our star, is a charismatic serial killer who has agreed to a documentary film that showcases his motives, desires and actual killings. He explains how going after elderly people is best because they put up less of a fight and that Postmen are his favorite targets. Ben discusses classical music, architecture and philosophy all while murdering random people. After a while, Ben brings the film crew further into his world than they had ever wanted to go. Along the way learning about his interests and witnessing the random killings, even becoming part of the ""action"" so to speak.Director, R&eacute;my Belvaux did a great job and I think it was smart to film in B&W.; If it were filmed in color, I think this would have been an entirely different movie experience. Make no mistake, Belvaux has made one of the most violent and disturbing movies I have ever seen. Luckily for us, the gore isn't as impactful due to the black and white. Thankfully, this adheres to the ""A Killer Comedy"" tag-line and further pushes the comedy aspect.What makes ""Man Bites Dog"" so powerful is this roller coaster of emotions. One minute you are laughing your ass off and the next you are legitimately terrified and disturbed. It causes you to question what you were laughing at to begin with. It sort of takes away a bit of your humanity. You are almost ashamed to have laughed at all. After the two main brutal scenes the film reverts back to it's black comedy base. At the end I felt like I had been through a very stressful experience yet I loved every minute of it.The film is wonderfully acted and the script is great. There were many times that I was questioning whether this was ""real"" or not. A testament to all involved.

Both of them use said images for criticism of status quo.Whereas Punishment Park is hateful and extreme, however, this movie is playful and endearing. The latter film has a tendency to show the narrator's absolute loathing of the situation at hand, while Man Bites Dog shows the tendency for the narrator to fall in love with his subject. Ben and company tramp around the city, making their film and having their fun, and it seems like a documentary any filmmaker would love to make.It's interesting that the back of the box says that the fictional documentarists ""sacrifice their objectivity and their morals"" considering this film seems so much more real and objective than most of the documentaries out there. It's actually missing a bit of scenes and imagery as if stuff is being done in one take, it isn't so filled with the desire for ""objective proof"" that it doesn't show anything, and it slowly ingratiates us with a character who is lively and real and enjoys the camera around instead of pretends to ignore it.Most likely the most brilliant part of this film is the moment they come across the other filmmakers. Not only does the absurdity in self-reflexively showing how untruthful documentary style is come full circle, it poses a fascinating question on the popularity of documentary to the level that documentarists could ""run into each other"". Of course they can't use each other's work... ""That's video, this is film.""

Both are violent, very violent. While NBK is violent to make a message (and one hell of a message it makes) Man Bites Dog is far more subtle in its delivery. Sure, there is violence a-go-go. But it also uses alot of what you do not see to its advantage and disturbs you.Besides, in a day and age where violence is a fad and a moneymaker, Man Bites Dog is a genuine film needed to be witnissed for its message to be understood. You are allowed to enjoy Benoit. He is a smart, philisophical, funny, and poetic person who just happens to have a different outlook on the importance of human life. You grow to like his character, even at his most liquored and obsene.As for the violence...besides the rape scene only included on the NC-17 version of the film, the violence is relatively low key. It disturbs you more because it isn't presented in that fast paced mtv style approach where your brain doesn't have enough time to register what it has seen. You witness everything. And you are not allowed to look away from the atroctites. In many ways, we are the eyes of the film crew. If we're along for the ride, then we wait until it has finished.

So many faults in fact, I find it amusing that some people find the violent images so drastically offensive.For starters, this film is much like Criterion's other mockumentary title, ""This is Spinal Tap"". The main differences being that a camera crew supposedly follows the exploits of an eccentric serial killer(Ben) rather than an eccentric band, and the budget. Parallels can be drawn between the main characters of each film, including aristocratic and artistic attitude, self-indulgence, and self-righteousness despite the characters' obvious personality flaws. Also as Spinal Tap tragically loses drummers along the way, the camera crew in Man Bites Dog tragically loses sound technicians along the way in a series of accidental shootings while the crew films Ben at work. This offers a good jab at the motion picture industry too, with the surviving crew purveying an air of ""we are deeply saddened about the loss of our team member, BUT THE SHOW MUST GO ON.""What truly makes this film work is the fascist undercurrents that seemingly bring Ben to each explosive act; films like Fight Club have drawn similar plot points. Ben often comments about the different social downfalls occuring during his time with the camera crew. It often follows that after Ben complains about a social issue, he goes out and acts violently against the people who, while are not necessarily responsible for it, somehow take part in what he views as society's downfall. One blatant example is a scene in which Ben laments the government-forced relocation of a dear friend to make way for low-cost housing projects. The next scene is Ben murdering a night watchman at one of these construction sites, raving about the inefficiencies and penny pinching nature of the companies inviolved.Don't believe the hype you read in other reviews about the violence herein. The boy who is murdered during the Clockwork Orange style ""random visit"", is the same boy who appears earlier in the film under completely different circumstances. The rape scene, while portrayed as somewhat realistic, is offset by the surprisingly disinterested husband of said ""rape victim"", who idly stands by and watches as if he could care less about what is happening, without putting up any fight whatsoever. A big blow to the desired effect of realism.The film does come around full circle, with all involved getting their just comuppence in the end. While visually flawed and shot on a shoestring budget, this timeless look at human nature is both a triumph and a required viewing for those of us interested in the motivations of people who look at human life with less a value than we, the viewers, do.",5,"A Funny ""Mockumentary"" Meets A Serious Look At Fascism",1110499200,"03 11, 2005",2005,2746,"['film', 'truly', 'work', 'stylized', 'genius', 'visually', 'can', 'find', 'many', 'faults', 'So', 'many', 'faults', 'fact', 'find', 'amusing', 'people', 'find', 'violent', 'images', 'so', 'drastically', 'offensive.For', 'starters', 'film', 'much', 'Criterion', 'other', 'mockumentary', 'title', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'main', 'differences', 'being', 'camera', 'crew', 'supposedly', 'exploits', 'eccentric', 'serial', 'killer', 'Ben', 'rather', 'eccentric', 'band', 'budget', 'Parallels', 'can', 'be', 'drawn', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'including', 'aristocratic', 'artistic', 'attitude', 'self-indulgence', 'self-righteousness', 'characters', 'obvious', 'personality', 'flaws', 'Also', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'tragically', 'drummers', 'way', 'camera', 'crew', 'Man', 'Bites', 'Dog', 'tragically', 'sound', 'technicians', 'way', 'series', 'accidental', 'shootings', 'crew', 'films', 'Ben', 'work', 'good', 'jab', 'motion', 'picture', 'industry', 'too', 'surviving', 'crew', 'purveying', 'air', 'are', 'deeply', 'saddened', 'loss', 'team', 'member', 'BUT', 'THE', 'SHOW', 'MUST', 'GO', 'ON', 'What', 'truly', 'film', 'work', 'fascist', 'undercurrents', 'seemingly', 'bring', 'Ben', 'explosive', 'act', 'films', 'Fight', 'Club', 'have', 'drawn', 'similar', 'plot', 'points', 'Ben', 'often', 'comments', 'different', 'social', 'downfalls', 'occuring', 'time', 'camera', 'crew', 'often', 'Ben', 'social', 'issue', 'out', 'violently', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'responsible', 'somehow', 'take', 'part', 'what', 'society', 'downfall', 'One', 'blatant', 'example', 'scene', 'Ben', 'government-forced', 'relocation', 'dear', 'friend', 'make', 'way', 'low-cost', 'housing', 'projects', 'next', 'scene', 'Ben', 'murdering', 'night', 'watchman', 'one', 'construction', 'sites', 'raving', 'inefficiencies', 'penny', 'pinching', 'nature', 'companies', 'inviolved.Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'hype', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'violence', 'herein', 'boy', 'who', 'murdered', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'style', 'random', 'visit', 'same', 'boy', 'who', 'earlier', 'film', 'completely', 'different', 'circumstances', 'rape', 'scene', 'portrayed', 'somewhat', 'realistic', 'offset', 'surprisingly', 'disinterested', 'husband', 'said', 'rape', 'victim', 'who', 'idly', 'watches', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'what', 'happening', 'putting', 'up', 'fight', 'whatsoever', 'big', 'blow', 'desired', 'effect', 'realism.The', 'film', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'involved', 'getting', 'just', 'comuppence', 'end', 'visually', 'flawed', 'shot', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'timeless', 'look', 'human', 'nature', 'triumph', 'required', 'viewing', 'interested', 'motivations', 'people', 'who', 'look', 'human', 'life', 'less', 'value', 'viewers', 'do']",N/A

In a shockingly cold manner, he notices while in the home of an elderly woman, that she takes a medication for a heart condition. Instead of shooting her, he pulls out the gun and yells in a threatening manner, she has a heart attack as a result. He notes that bullets cost money and not worth wasting when they aren't necessary. There are also scenes where he smothers a child to death with his pillow and murders his parents.This film was an attempt to satirize media violence but all it does is glorify it.There are special features on the DVD also. There is a theatrical trailer, an interview with the filmmakers, a photo gallery, and a short film made by the filmmakers titled, No C4 for Daniel-Daniel, officially know as, ""Pas de C4 pour Daniel Daniel"" This short film, though is good and has some martial arts like slapstick humor reminiscent of the Yuen brothers' ""Wu-tang"" films.Avoid this movie unless you like similar films.From now on, I will get more info about Criterion DVD's before watching them, I will still note and rate the special features of each one though.",1,Sadistic trash.

The film is more a stylistic exercise and intellectual essay on cinema's relationship with violence, and as such is open to endless debate and reinterpretation.The film follows the exploits of the smug, self-satisfied Benoit Poelvoorde as he goes about his daily work - murder for pleasure and profit - with a low-budget black and white documentary film crew in tow. The crew become seduced by the violence they 'document', carrying on with an interview while holding down a child for him to kill and participating in and instigating a gang rape. They are untouched by the horror of his actions until it directly affects them, most particularly in a sort of running joke in which their soundmen keep getting killed.This complicity between filmmakers and life-takers is compounded by the fact that the film's killer and camera crew all use their real names on screen. There is certainly an inherent element of criticism of the artist's acceptance of violence as a form of self-expression - not only the film crew but a female musician Poelvoorde knows accept his actions as just being 'his work.'The violence is shocking, as it should be, more for this casual acceptance (although the most genuinely disturbing moment is the fraction of a second when Poelvoorde's laughter dies and is immediately replaced by a grim face after the music lesson), but is never openly condemned. Since none of the characters on screen exercise any morality, it is up to the viewer to bring his or her morality to bear on the picture. Not always easy viewing, the film is ultimately more interesting for the issues it raises about filmmakers and filmgoers complicity in screen violence than for what is actually on screen.",3,A day in the life of a serial killer...,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,1864,"['sort', 'serial', 'killing', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'jokes', 'satire', 'Remy', 'Belvaux', 'Andre', 'Bonzel', 'Benoit', 'Poelvoorde', 'Man', 'Bites', 'Dog', 'just', ""n't"", 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'more', 'stylistic', 'exercise', 'intellectual', 'essay', 'cinema', 'relationship', 'violence', 'such', 'open', 'endless', 'debate', 'reinterpretation.The', 'film', 'exploits', 'smug', 'self-satisfied', 'Benoit', 'Poelvoorde', 'daily', 'work', 'murder', 'pleasure', 'profit', 'low-budget', 'black', 'white', 'documentary', 'film', 'crew', 'tow', 'crew', 'become', 'seduced', 'violence', ""'document"", 'carrying', 'interview', 'holding', 'down', 'child', 'kill', 'participating', 'instigating', 'gang', 'rape', 'are', 'untouched', 'horror', 'actions', 'directly', 'most', 'particularly', 'sort', 'running', 'joke', 'soundmen', 'keep', 'getting', 'killed.This', 'complicity', 'filmmakers', 'life-takers', 'compounded', 'fact', 'film', 'killer', 'camera', 'crew', 'use', 'real', 'names', 'screen', 'certainly', 'inherent', 'element', 'criticism', 'artist', 'acceptance', 'violence', 'form', 'self-expression', 'not', 'only', 'film', 'crew', 'female', 'musician', 'Poelvoorde', 'accept', 'actions', 'just', 'being', ""'his"", 'work', ""'The"", 'violence', 'shocking', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'casual', 'acceptance', 'most', 'genuinely', 'disturbing', 'moment', 'fraction', 'second', 'when', 'Poelvoorde', 'laughter', 'dies', 'immediately', 'replaced', 'grim', 'face', 'music', 'lesson', 'never', 'openly', 'condemned', 'none', 'characters', 'screen', 'exercise', 'morality', 'viewer', 'bring', 'morality', 'bear', 'picture', 'Not', 'always', 'easy', 'viewing', 'film', 'ultimately', 'more', 'interesting', 'issues', 'filmmakers', 'filmgoers', 'complicity', 'screen', 'violence', 'what', 'actually', 'screen']",N/A
