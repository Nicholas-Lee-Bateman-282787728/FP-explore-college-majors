My main concern was: What did he really learn over the course of this violent, bloody day? (This film is not yet rated.) After discussing this with other audience members, we were unclear....We watched:* Michael Rainey Jr. (""Un Altro Mondo"" for which he learned to speak Italian) is our hero, living with his grandmother and dazzled by his smooth-talking, fine-dressing, handsome ex-con uncle, who helps him ditch school for the day.* Common (""New Year's Eve"") is slick Uncle Vincent who refuses to work for anyone else, he wants to be his own boss. Since he got out of prison, he hasn't made many friends, so he takes his hero-worshiping little nephew along to ""learn the ropes.""* Dennis Haysbert (""The Unit"") is one of the brothers Uncle Vincent visits with his wide-eyed nephew in tow.* Danny Glover (""Mysteria"") is in charge of the deal that allegedly will make Uncle Vincent rich enough to start his own crab shack on the waterfront in Baltimore.* Michael Kenneth Williams (Omar in ""The Wire"") is a Baltimore cop who is hot on the trail of Uncle Vincent and his nervous nephew.* Lonette McKee (""Dream Street"") is our little hero's grandmother. She knows her son is lying in his teeth even as she signs the papers for that second mortgage.As this violent day draws to a close, our thirteen year old has learned how to wear a suit, shoot a gun and drive a car. I realize he's still a child, but when I considered his situation just before the final credits, I'm afraid he might have learned the wrong lessons.If you get this one from Amazon, please let me know what you think.

He's missing his mother and he's always thinking about the day when he'll see her again. There is no father around, but his Uncle Vincent (Common) is back after serving time in prison.I will begin with this: Michael Rainey, Jr. is a talented young man. His performance was excellent. And Common gave a good performance.Common's character, Vincent: He wanted to start his own business. That was admirable. But from the time he left the breakfast table, I could not stop shaking my head at this man. The choices he made concerning Woody and things he said to his nephew disappointed me at times, and then I became bothered and then angry and I began to fuss at the screen. I thought he wanted a better life. I thought he was going to teach his nephew valuable life lessons. Instead, he introduced Woody to a world he should have kept him away from. Far, far away. He allowed Woody to listen to conversations he should have never heard, to see things he should have never seen, and to experience something that I'm surprised didn't traumatize the ""little man"". Vincent may have thought about his life while he was incarcerated, but he still had serious issues.There are good actors in this movie - Lonette McKee, Danny Glover, Dennis Haysbert, Charles S.

1618726,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00AZL310A,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","***1/2Artfully directed by Sheldon Candis,"" LUV"" is a compelling, low-budget tale of Vincent, a recently released convict who takes his young nephew, Woody, on a day-long excursion through Baltimore to give him lessons on how to survive in the urban jungle that is his home (Woody's mother lives in North Carolina while his grandmother is currently raising him in Maryland). This includes, among other things, teaching him how to drive and how to shoot a gun. But the main focus is on Vincent's attempts to go straight and to secure a loan for a restaurant he wants to open. But the young man soon discovers that it isn't all that easy to cut the ties with one's criminal past, and Woody bears witness to some pretty horrendous events throughout the course of the day.Taken as a whole, ""LUV"" is considerably less than the sum of its parts. The screenplay by Candis feels strangely doughy and underdeveloped, often leaving us bewildered as to what exactly Vincent is up to and who it is he's interacting with at any given moment. That being said, ""LUV"" manages to hold our interest due to the immediacy of its style and the naturalism of its performances. Common makes us care about Vincent; we see him as an ambitious young man who, despite his natural inclination towards crime - an inclination obviously resulting from the difficult circumstances in which he was raised - appears to be genuinely trying to turn his life around. That the world and his past seem to be conspiring against him is what makes the tale so poignant. Vincent may not be the perfect role model for his young nephew, but he is probably the best the boy is going to have for the foreseeable future.But it is young Michael Rainey, Jr., in a star-making performance as Woody, who walks off with the film. Even at the tender young age of eleven, Rainey is already a natural in front of the camera and it is his wholly believable reactions to what is taking place around him that strike a responsive chord in the viewer. Indeed, we are willing to go on this structurally awkward and artistically uneven journey simply for the privilege of reveling in his performance. Rainey, in essence, becomes the thread holding all these seemingly random and arbitrary events together. One looks forward to great things from him in the future.",3,"uneven film with a star-making performance by Michael Rainey, Jr.",1372291200,"06 27, 2013",2013,2300,"['***1/2Artfully', 'directed', 'Sheldon', 'Candis', 'LUV', 'compelling', 'low-budget', 'tale', 'Vincent', 'recently', 'released', 'convict', 'who', 'young', 'nephew', 'Woody', 'day-long', 'excursion', 'Baltimore', 'give', 'lessons', 'how', 'survive', 'urban', 'jungle', 'home', 'Woody', 'mother', 'North', 'Carolina', 'grandmother', 'currently', 'raising', 'Maryland', 'other', 'things', 'teaching', 'how', 'drive', 'how', 'shoot', 'gun', 'main', 'focus', 'Vincent', 'attempts', 'go', 'straight', 'secure', 'loan', 'restaurant', 'open', 'young', 'man', 'soon', ""n't"", 'easy', 'cut', 'ties', 'one', 'criminal', 'past', 'Woody', 'witness', 'pretty', 'horrendous', 'events', 'course', 'day.Taken', 'whole', 'LUV', 'considerably', 'less', 'sum', 'parts', 'screenplay', 'Candis', 'feels', 'strangely', 'doughy', 'underdeveloped', 'often', 'leaving', 'bewildered', 'what', 'exactly', 'Vincent', 'who', 'interacting', 'given', 'moment', 'being', 'said', 'LUV', 'hold', 'interest', 'due', 'immediacy', 'style', 'naturalism', 'performances', 'Common', 'care', 'Vincent', 'see', 'ambitious', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'natural', 'inclination', 'towards', 'crime', 'inclination', 'obviously', 'resulting', 'difficult', 'circumstances', 'was', 'raised', 'be', 'genuinely', 'trying', 'turn', 'life', 'around', 'world', 'past', 'seem', 'be', 'conspiring', 'what', 'tale', 'so', 'poignant', 'Vincent', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'role', 'model', 'young', 'nephew', 'probably', 'best', 'boy', 'going', 'have', 'foreseeable', 'future.But', 'young', 'Michael', 'Rainey', 'Jr.', 'star-making', 'performance', 'Woody', 'who', 'walks', 'off', 'film', 'Even', 'tender', 'young', 'age', 'eleven', 'Rainey', 'already', 'natural', 'front', 'camera', 'wholly', 'believable', 'reactions', 'what', 'taking', 'place', 'strike', 'responsive', 'chord', 'viewer', 'Indeed', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'structurally', 'awkward', 'artistically', 'uneven', 'journey', 'simply', 'privilege', 'reveling', 'performance', 'Rainey', 'essence', 'thread', 'holding', 'seemingly', 'random', 'arbitrary', 'events', 'together', 'One', 'forward', 'great', 'things', 'future']",LUV
