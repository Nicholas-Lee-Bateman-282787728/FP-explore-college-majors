Kote ""poison ivy""","[2, 3]","""I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry relies so heavily on gay stereotypes, that at times it feels like audiences are laughing at us, not with us."" I can't think of a quote more fitting for this film than that one. This Adam Sandler comedy is inane, childish and so often ridiculous that I can't even begin to see why GLAAD gave it its stamp of approval. The premise revolves around two straight firefighters who pose as gay men and along the way learn about tolerance, but this lesson doesn't occur until the end, so really, will an audience or anyone learn anything from this comedy after watching an hour and a half of gay stereotypes with everything from a limp wrist, to a lisp to the overly flamboyant son of the male protagonist, gay slurs, homophobic characters who shudder at the thought of watching these two men kiss, and who fear of an over-done joke of 'dropping the soap' in the shower room? I doubt it. Take this for example, upon me seeing this title in theaters, the audience laughed wildly when Sandler questions ""What, you mean fags?"" but began to muster sounds of disgust when at the end two men share a quick kiss at their wedding in the film. Skip this film, and instead opt for Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore to get your Adam Sandler fix, or better yet, Milk if you're looking for an intelligent film centered around the gay community.",2,Misses the mark,1264982400,"02 1, 2010",2010,1355,"['Now', 'Pronounce', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'so', 'heavily', 'gay', 'stereotypes', 'times', 'audiences', 'are', 'laughing', 'not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'quote', 'more', 'fitting', 'film', 'one', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'comedy', 'inane', 'childish', 'so', 'often', 'ridiculous', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'see', 'why', 'GLAAD', 'gave', 'stamp', 'approval', 'premise', 'around', 'two', 'straight', 'firefighters', 'who', 'pose', 'gay', 'men', 'way', 'learn', 'tolerance', 'lesson', ""n't"", 'occur', 'end', 'so', 'really', 'will', 'audience', 'anyone', 'learn', 'anything', 'comedy', 'watching', 'hour', 'half', 'gay', 'stereotypes', 'everything', 'limp', 'wrist', 'lisp', 'overly', 'flamboyant', 'son', 'male', 'protagonist', 'gay', 'slurs', 'homophobic', 'characters', 'who', 'shudder', 'thought', 'watching', 'two', 'men', 'kiss', 'who', 'fear', 'over-done', 'joke', ""'dropping"", 'soap', 'shower', 'room', 'doubt', 'Take', 'example', 'seeing', 'title', 'theaters', 'audience', 'laughed', 'wildly', 'when', 'Sandler', 'questions', 'What', 'mean', 'fags', 'began', 'muster', 'sounds', 'disgust', 'when', 'end', 'two', 'men', 'share', 'quick', 'kiss', 'wedding', 'film', 'Skip', 'film', 'instead', 'opt', 'Billy', 'Madison', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'get', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'fix', 'better', 'yet', 'Milk', ""'re"", 'looking', 'intelligent', 'film', 'centered', 'gay', 'community']",N/A

1105372,A14COU5OWHU5RT,B000VXWX7E,Allen,"[1, 2]","Adam Sandler and Kevin James (THE KING OF QUEENS) provide big laughs in I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK AND LARRY, an uproariously funny comedy that, though not terribly concerned with being politically correct, will make you laugh in spite of yourself. Sandler is Chuck and James play Larry, best friends and firemen who have seen each other through everything, including the death of Larry's wife. After a recent brush with death in a bad fire, Larry becomes concerned that his current insurance benefits will not properly provide for his children in the event of his death and learns that the only way he can properly provide for his children is to enter into a domestic partnership with Chuck, where they would pretend to be gay lovers and actually marry. Laying aside the fact that I can't imagine two heterosexual men ever doing this in real life, it does lay the groundwork for one of the funniest comedies I have seen in years. Gay stereotypes are perpetuated at every turn but there is nothing mean-spirited about it making the incredible premise plausible. Also thrown into the mix are Larry's son, whose interests seem to be limited to tap dancing, baking, and auditioning for the school musical, and a pretty attorney (Jessica Biel) who catches Chuck's eye but unfortunately he has to conceal his feelings about her. Mention should also be made of a hilarious supporting turn from Ving Rhames as a fellow firefighter who is inspired to come out of the closet, after being inspired by Chuck and Larry's relationship. Primarily, it is the inspired comic teaming of Adam Sandler and Kevin James that makes this one work.",4,Pretty good movie!,1274572800,"05 23, 2010",2010,1623,"['Adam', 'Sandler', 'Kevin', 'James', 'THE', 'KING', 'OF', 'QUEENS', 'provide', 'big', 'laughs', 'NOW', 'PRONOUNCE', 'YOU', 'CHUCK', 'AND', 'LARRY', 'uproariously', 'funny', 'comedy', 'not', 'terribly', 'concerned', 'being', 'politically', 'correct', 'will', 'make', 'spite', 'Sandler', 'Chuck', 'James', 'play', 'Larry', 'best', 'friends', 'firemen', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'everything', 'including', 'death', 'Larry', 'wife', 'recent', 'brush', 'death', 'bad', 'fire', 'Larry', 'concerned', 'current', 'insurance', 'benefits', 'will', 'not', 'properly', 'provide', 'children', 'event', 'death', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'properly', 'provide', 'children', 'enter', 'domestic', 'partnership', 'Chuck', 'where', 'would', 'pretend', 'be', 'gay', 'lovers', 'actually', 'marry', 'Laying', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'two', 'heterosexual', 'men', 'ever', 'doing', 'real', 'life', 'lay', 'groundwork', 'one', 'funniest', 'comedies', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'Gay', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'perpetuated', 'turn', 'nothing', 'mean-spirited', 'making', 'incredible', 'premise', 'plausible', 'Also', 'thrown', 'mix', 'are', 'Larry', 'son', 'interests', 'seem', 'be', 'limited', 'tap', 'dancing', 'baking', 'auditioning', 'school', 'musical', 'pretty', 'attorney', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'who', 'Chuck', 'eye', 'unfortunately', 'conceal', 'feelings', 'Mention', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'made', 'hilarious', 'supporting', 'turn', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'fellow', 'firefighter', 'who', 'inspired', 'come', 'closet', 'being', 'inspired', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'relationship', 'Primarily', 'inspired', 'comic', 'teaming', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Kevin', 'James', 'one', 'work']",N/A

1105374,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000VXWX7E,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 7]","`I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry' went wrong in so many areas and disappointed on so many levels I really don't know what to say other than please stay away.  Upon the closing I looked at my wife and uttered those words you never want to have to say after watching a film you were actually excited about seeing.""They could have done so much better with this movie.""The truth remains that `I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry' could have been hilarious.  While I'm not the biggest Adam Sandler fan I will admit to finding him funny on occasions, and Kevin James is just hilariously funny in my book.  You throw in the gorgeous Jessica Biel and you have my undivided attention.  Problem is that none of these three actors can help the script they were handed, and that script is an utter abomination.  It's as if the writers of `Chuck and Larry' decided that instead of expanding their joke vocabulary so-to-speak they would instead use one vulgar joke over and over again.  It wasn't funny the first time, so about the thirtieth time it's still not funny.  That and the fact that none of this film is the slightest bit believable (and it could have been because it's not like the plot is all that impossible) make for a really disappointing experience.So `Chuck and Larry' revolves around Chuck and Larry, two firefighters who pose as a `couple' so that Larry's children can receive the benefits of his pension should something happen to him.  Larry is a widower who cares for his children and has yet to move on from the memory of his wife.  Chuck is a jerk who lives a life that is so ridiculously unrealistic it made me roll my eyes in irritation.  Upon their filing for `domestic partnership' they are immediately investigated and suspected of cheating the government so they hire a lawyer to help them avoid going to prison.  This lawyer is the beautiful Alex McDonough whom Chuck immediately falls for.`Chuck and Larry' falls apart again trying to be a message film.  Films like `Chuck and Larry' are not here to make us think twice about discrimination and tolerance, they are here to make us laugh.  Instead it spends a good three quarters of its length spitting out slur after slur expecting us to laugh and then changes its tune expecting us to believe that this experience has changed them (mainly Chuck since Larry was never that big of a jerk to begin with).  Adam Sandler's humor in this film is just not funny at all and he irritated the fire out of me.  Kevin James was better than Sandler but still failed to capitalize on what could have been a really funny film.  Jessica Biel's character, especially her relationship with Chuck, is unbelievable and ridiculous to say the least.  Alex must be the dumbest and most desperate lawyer in the world.Dan Aykroyd has taken a huge fall from his `Driving Miss Daisy' days for his performances in the most recent of Sandler films has been nothing short of horrible.  His humor is also not funny.  Ving Rhames has a funny turn here, stereotypical (how can a movie chuck full of the most blatant of stereotypes insist on delivering a message) but funny none-the-less.There are some funny sequences in the film, but they are few.  The whole scene with Larry in the apple costume had me rolling and made up for the first half of the film somewhat, and the shower sequence had me giggling a bit, but all that aside there really is nothing to truly laugh at other than the same repetitive jokes.  It's funny to see Rob Schneider play an Asian minister.  I can't think of anything else really.  I could never recommend this movie, which is sad because they really could have been smart here instead of predictable and created a truly hilarious comedy.  I suggest you rent `Hitch' or watch reruns of `The King of Queens' instead, or rent Kevin James' stand up `Sweat the Small Stuff' because this movie offers very little while those suggestions are much more satisfying.",2,I now pronounce you a big disappointment...,1194825600,"11 12, 2007",2007,3925,"['Now', 'Pronounce', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'went', 'wrong', 'so', 'many', 'areas', 'disappointed', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'say', 'other', 'please', 'stay', 'away', 'closing', 'looked', 'wife', 'uttered', 'words', 'never', 'want', 'have', 'say', 'watching', 'film', 'were', 'actually', 'excited', 'seeing', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'truth', 'Now', 'Pronounce', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'hilarious', ""'m"", 'not', 'biggest', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'fan', 'will', 'admit', 'finding', 'funny', 'occasions', 'Kevin', 'James', 'just', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'book', 'throw', 'gorgeous', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'have', 'undivided', 'attention', 'Problem', 'none', 'three', 'actors', 'can', 'help', 'script', 'were', 'handed', 'script', 'utter', 'abomination', 'writers', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'decided', 'instead', 'expanding', 'joke', 'so-to-speak', 'would', 'instead', 'use', 'one', 'vulgar', 'joke', 'over', 'again', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'first', 'time', 'so', 'thirtieth', 'time', 'still', 'not', 'funny', 'fact', 'none', 'film', 'slightest', 'bit', 'believable', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'not', 'plot', 'impossible', 'make', 'really', 'disappointing', 'experience.So', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'revolves', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'two', 'firefighters', 'who', 'pose', 'couple', 'so', 'Larry', 'children', 'can', 'receive', 'benefits', 'pension', 'should', 'something', 'happen', 'Larry', 'widower', 'who', 'children', 'yet', 'move', 'memory', 'wife', 'Chuck', 'jerk', 'who', 'life', 'so', 'ridiculously', 'unrealistic', 'made', 'roll', 'eyes', 'irritation', 'filing', 'domestic', 'partnership', 'are', 'immediately', 'investigated', 'suspected', 'cheating', 'government', 'hire', 'lawyer', 'help', 'avoid', 'going', 'prison', 'lawyer', 'beautiful', 'Alex', 'McDonough', 'whom', 'Chuck', 'immediately', 'for.', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'falls', 'apart', 'again', 'trying', 'be', 'message', 'film', 'Films', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'are', 'not', 'here', 'make', 'think', 'twice', 'discrimination', 'tolerance', 'are', 'here', 'make', 'Instead', 'good', 'three', 'quarters', 'length', 'spitting', 'out', 'slur', 'slur', 'expecting', 'laugh', 'then', 'tune', 'expecting', 'believe', 'experience', 'changed', 'mainly', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'was', 'never', 'big', 'jerk', 'begin', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'humor', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'funny', 'irritated', 'fire', 'Kevin', 'James', 'was', 'better', 'Sandler', 'still', 'failed', 'capitalize', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'funny', 'film', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'character', 'especially', 'relationship', 'Chuck', 'unbelievable', 'ridiculous', 'say', 'least', 'Alex', 'must', 'be', 'dumbest', 'most', 'desperate', 'lawyer', 'world.Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'taken', 'huge', 'fall', 'Driving', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'days', 'performances', 'most', 'recent', 'Sandler', 'films', 'been', 'nothing', 'short', 'horrible', 'humor', 'also', 'not', 'funny', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'funny', 'turn', 'here', 'stereotypical', 'how', 'can', 'movie', 'chuck', 'full', 'most', 'blatant', 'stereotypes', 'insist', 'delivering', 'message', 'funny', 'none-the-less.There', 'are', 'funny', 'sequences', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'whole', 'scene', 'Larry', 'apple', 'costume', 'had', 'rolling', 'made', 'up', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'somewhat', 'shower', 'sequence', 'had', 'giggling', 'bit', 'aside', 'really', 'nothing', 'truly', 'laugh', 'other', 'same', 'repetitive', 'jokes', 'funny', 'see', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'play', 'Asian', 'minister', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'else', 'really', 'could', 'never', 'recommend', 'movie', 'sad', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'smart', 'here', 'instead', 'predictable', 'created', 'truly', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'suggest', 'rent', 'Hitch', 'watch', 'reruns', 'King', 'Queens', 'instead', 'rent', 'Kevin', 'James', 'stand', 'up', 'Sweat', 'Small', 'Stuff', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'suggestions', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying']",N/A

The ingredients are there for another successful movie from the Sandler team. In I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK AND LARRY, you have Sandler paired with two solid co-stars in the hilarious Kevin James and beautiful Jessica Beal. You have the trade mark childish, politically incorrect humor of Sandler. You have the usual great supporting cast of Sandler regulars Allen Covert, Steve Buchemi, Rob Schneider and Nicholas Tuturro. Ving Rhames and Dan Akroyd also star in limited roles.Okay, sounds like the movie should be funny, right? It is laugh out loud funny in many parts. Larry has lost his wife, and for some confusing reason, he needs a benificiary for his life insurance in case anything should happen to him while on the job. So, in order to ensure his kids have a bright future, Larry (Kevin James) does the only logical thing: talk womanizer Chuck (Adam Sandler) into being his domestic partner. Sounds easy enough, except the city of New York comes around investigating their relationship te ensure they aren't committing fraud. Much of the comedy comes from Sandler and James pretending to be gay to maintain the charade. It starts killing Sandler, when he becomes friends with a beautiful lawyer (Jessica Beil). He is falling for her, but must maintain the charade of being gay or else be thrown in jail for fraud.While much of the movie was funny, in the end, it is crushed under its own weight of stereotypes and preaching. You see, instead of trying to be a comedy, it tried to also preach a message of tolerance. Social tolerance is a fine message, but not in a Sandler comedy. Regardless of your stance on the issues, you will find this movie offensive. In one scene, the movie showed vehement demonstrators protesting, one side a bunch of religious fanatics, the other side a bunch of extreme stereotypes of homosexuals. The movie also made light of a father dealing with a son who shows interest in singing and the theater instead of baseball, basically implying that his child was destined to be gay. Also, in every other scene, a character came out of the closet in response to Chuck and Larry's professed, but fake, love for each other. It was funny the first time, but grew old after the tenth.In summary, this movie has some funny scenes, but it lost me when it started trying to preach. The movie could have focused on Sandler's relationship with Beil or James' moving on after the loss of his wife. Instead, it just kept throwing stereotypes of gays at us in hopes of being funny. Maybe calling this movie offensive isn't the right word, because that gives this movie too much credit.

And Kevin James doesn't light my fire either usually, I don't watch his tv shows.  BUT this was different.  Yes the premise is a bit silly but, news flash, this is a comedy.  How many are based in reality?The movie Strange Bedfellows with Paul Hogan is similar.  If you get beyond the ""Who would do that"" ideas you get to the theme of men loving their friends and trying to help them - they don't have to be overly bright (because there are other ways to solve the problems, of course there are). This is a well paced movie, it gets to the point very quickly.  Of course some characters are over the top but they are off-set by Kevin James and surprisingly by Adam Sandler.  I have to say a memorable character is the son - who can do the splits and is into muscial theatre...hmmmm.  I don't like the minister who marries Chuck and Larry in Canada (Canadadians are sooo enlightened they allow marriage not just domestic partnerships or civil unions - but hey, NZ now is the same).  It is quite racially stereo-typical and offers a jarring note to me.What made me spit the coffee?  Ving Rhames acts like a homicidal axe murderer...you are just waiting for the point he explodes, you can practically see the steam coming out his nose as he glares and snorts at people.  Then Chuck and Larry are exposed as gay...horror. No-one wants to play with them at the fire station anymore...basketball, showers, work etc.  Alone of the basketball court Chuck gets confronted by the potential axe murderer Duncan and puts up his fists ready to be...well let's face it he would be slaughtered.  But lo and behold he gets a hug and Duncan comes out.  Did that make me spit coffee?  No, that was the aaawwwww moment.  The coffee needed to be cleaned up because of the shower scene, it starts off giggle funny and ends up wiping up the coffee funny...it is worth getting the movie just for that scene. I have decided I like Ving Rhames.For the guys there is the Jessica Biel scene were Chuck has to authenticate, in her bedroom (and she is in her underwear), that her breasts are 100% natural...he gives them a very good test...very thorough.  It is literally a touchy feely moment.  She of course thinks he is one of the girls (because consensus is that Chuck is the girl in the relationship - the kids even say so).What the movie shows is that if you change category in the eyes of the world for some sections of society the 'closed' sign is immediately erected.  Chuck and Larry were no longer wanted in their shift at the station.  Larry was no longer needed as a parent at school camping trips or little league...he is still the same person no matter who he bunks with but for some who you snuggle with determines your eligibility as a citizen in their closed little world.The deleted scenes and gag reels in the bonus feature had me laughing out loud too.I like this and I am not into comedies, really don't like slap-stick farcical movies.  This is a cut above - the performances of the main characters are solid, I am surprised.  Other characters were over the top but I suspect that is how they were written rather than the actors themselves.  Not going to become a fan of Sandler or James anytime soon but am a fan of them in this movie.  There is some star power here, and it is played to good effect.  Enjoy, and remember don't put food or drink in your mouth for much of this, you will just have to clean it up off the floor, walls, coffee table...",5,I laughed and spat my coffee - silly but funny,1204243200,"02 29, 2008",2008,3510,"['am', 'going', 'say', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'AM', 'NOT', 'AN', 'ADAM', 'SANDLER', 'FAN', 'Kevin', 'James', ""n't"", 'light', 'fire', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'tv', 'shows', 'BUT', 'was', 'different', 'Yes', 'premise', 'bit', 'silly', 'news', 'flash', 'comedy', 'How', 'many', 'are', 'based', 'reality', 'movie', 'Strange', 'Bedfellows', 'Paul', 'Hogan', 'similar', 'get', 'Who', 'would', 'do', 'ideas', 'get', 'theme', 'men', 'loving', 'friends', 'trying', 'help', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'overly', 'bright', 'are', 'other', 'ways', 'solve', 'problems', 'course', 'are', 'well', 'paced', 'movie', 'point', 'very', 'quickly', 'course', 'characters', 'are', 'top', 'are', 'off-set', 'Kevin', 'James', 'surprisingly', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'have', 'say', 'memorable', 'character', 'son', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'splits', 'muscial', 'theatre', 'hmmmm', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'minister', 'who', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'Canada', 'Canadadians', 'are', 'sooo', 'allow', 'marriage', 'not', 'just', 'domestic', 'partnerships', 'civil', 'unions', 'hey', 'NZ', 'now', 'same', 'quite', 'racially', 'stereo-typical', 'jarring', 'note', 'me.What', 'made', 'spit', 'coffee', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'acts', 'homicidal', 'axe', 'murderer', 'are', 'just', 'waiting', 'point', 'can', 'practically', 'see', 'steam', 'coming', 'out', 'nose', 'snorts', 'people', 'Then', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'are', 'exposed', 'gay', 'horror', 'No-one', 'play', 'fire', 'station', 'anymore', 'basketball', 'showers', 'work', 'etc', 'Alone', 'basketball', 'court', 'Chuck', 'confronted', 'potential', 'axe', 'murderer', 'Duncan', 'up', 'fists', 'ready', 'be', 'well', 'let', 'face', 'would', 'be', 'slaughtered', 'lo', 'behold', 'hug', 'Duncan', 'out', 'Did', 'make', 'spit', 'coffee', 'No', 'was', 'aaawwwww', 'moment', 'coffee', 'needed', 'be', 'cleaned', 'up', 'shower', 'scene', 'giggle', 'funny', 'up', 'wiping', 'up', 'coffee', 'funny', 'worth', 'getting', 'movie', 'just', 'scene', 'have', 'decided', 'Ving', 'Rhames.For', 'guys', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'scene', 'were', 'Chuck', 'authenticate', 'bedroom', 'underwear', 'breasts', 'are', '100', '%', 'natural', 'very', 'good', 'test', 'very', 'literally', 'touchy', 'feely', 'moment', 'course', 'thinks', 'one', 'girls', 'consensus', 'Chuck', 'girl', 'relationship', 'kids', 'even', 'say', 'so', 'movie', 'change', 'category', 'eyes', 'world', 'sections', 'society', ""'closed"", 'sign', 'immediately', 'erected', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'wanted', 'shift', 'station', 'Larry', 'was', 'longer', 'needed', 'parent', 'school', 'camping', 'trips', 'little', 'league', 'still', 'same', 'person', 'matter', 'who', 'who', 'snuggle', 'determines', 'eligibility', 'citizen', 'closed', 'little', 'world.The', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reels', 'bonus', 'feature', 'had', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'too.I', 'am', 'not', 'comedies', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'slap-stick', 'farcical', 'movies', 'cut', 'performances', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'solid', 'am', 'surprised', 'Other', 'characters', 'were', 'top', 'suspect', 'how', 'were', 'written', 'rather', 'actors', 'Not', 'going', 'become', 'fan', 'Sandler', 'James', 'anytime', 'soon', 'am', 'fan', 'movie', 'star', 'power', 'here', 'played', 'good', 'effect', 'Enjoy', 'remember', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'food', 'drink', 'mouth', 'much', 'will', 'just', 'have', 'clean', 'up', 'floor', 'walls', 'coffee', 'table']",N/A

A friend suggested I give it a try since it had some merit, but to realize that, after all, this an Adam Sandler film and to view it in that context.  Good advice, so we don't look for Oscar-worthy efforts. :)In that context, ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry"" (2007) was honestly better than I was expecting, especially after seeing the trailers and reading some earlier critical reviews.  It's essentially a unique and entertaining romantic comedy about two men who, while they are not gay, nevertheless have a real love and devotion to each other, from years of working together as NYC firefighters and friends.  Larry (Kevin James) is a widower with two kids, who calls in a big favor from his partner, the womanizing Chuck (Sandler), asking him to pose as his domestic partner to finagle a problem that could keep his kids from collecting his pension if he got killed on the job (long and seemingly illogical story, but bureaucratic red-tape rarely makes sense.)  When the city assigns an investigator (played to the hilt by Steve Buscemi) to make sure that the couple are really domestic partners, Chuck has to move in with Larry and the kids, trying to make it look perfectly legit.  They hire an attorney (Jessica Biel) for whom Chuck immediately has the ""hots"" for, and it all starts to unravel from there.As a gay man, I congratulate the writers and director for having the guts to push the envelope a bit on the gay stereotype content, veering far from political correctness, but generally balancing it out with fairness and a growing realization by the characters (including their co-workers) that bigotry and discrimination is just dumb, that's all.  Chuck and Larry face such bigotry and hatred head on, in several instances, and while the exact scenarios may be unrealistic and a bit cartoonish, the message still comes through loud and clear.The film has a great cast, also including Dan Aykroyd, Ving Rhames,  Nicholas Turturro, Rachel Dratch, Rob Schneider, Richard Chamberlain and even Lance Bass (as a singer at a gay wedding).  DVD extras include numerous deleted scenes, out-takes, interviews with some actors, and behind-the-scenes and production footage.  It's mostly fluff, after all, but has its funny moments, and it is obvious that the cast had a great time putting it together.

While Jessica did indeed look fantastic I was relieved when the movie finally came to an end.There are definitely some funny moments but there is also a predominance of predictable sequences we've all seen over and over again in other films.

Let me expound on that -- The first part of the movie was written to cater to teenage boys, or some very drunk early 20 somethings single males (this was apparent when my wife even mentioned this, stopped watching and went to read a book in another room).  To exemplify, Adam Sandler is attractive enough and man enough to take on 8 Hooters girls, and the professional doctor that despised him, all at one time in his apartment as they ran around half-naked in their skivvies while frolicking with one another? Gimme a break!  AND, he could bed twin sisters and then influence them to kiss one another (can you say, incest?  NOT HOT) as part of his plan to have them fight over him?  UGH!!!!  Finally, after about 35 minutes of proving the point that he was all man, the movie shifted to the gay-friend theme and picked up just a bit -- BUT, it was slow in coming.  Actually okay, from then on minus the cliche after cliche that bombarded the audience.

The film is rife with cliche, scatalogical humor, and superstition but therein lies the rub.  By resorting to stereotype the flick exposes the misunderstandings between people of different sexual orientations and fosters empathy, if not respect, for each other.  It also helps they've employed blue-collar icons Adam Sandler and Kevin James as our conduit.  If memory serves this film received something of a lukewarm response from the critics and methinks there is a little elitism on their part.  Most films that tackle homosexuality are geared toward that specific audience so in essence they are preaching to the choir.  By casting two actors with mainstream appeal the message is transmitted to a larger audience so the end result is ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" can impact more people than ""Brokeback Mountain"".

1105395,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B000VXWX7E,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[2, 4]","You've gotta wonder about Kevin James. A couple years ago, he practically stole the show by planting a kiss on Will Smith in the date flick Hitch. Now he's in another big budget comedy ready to lock lips with Adam Sandler. Maybe his hit TV show King of Queens had a double meaning...Watching James dance around make-out scenes with Sandler isn't necessarily on my short list of things to see before I die, but it didn't stop me from finding a lot of funny moments in I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.The film tells the story of Brooklyn firefighter Larry Valentine (James) who discovers that his pension is in jeopardy because he failed to file the proper paperwork after his wife passed away. In order to ensure the money goes to his kids in the event of his death, he hatches a scheme to keep things straight, so to speak.Larry convinces his best bud, ladies man Chuck Levine (Sandler), to pose as his gay husband. They think they have things locked up until the city begins an investigation on their relationship to make sure it's real. Chuck and Larry begrudgingly carry on pretenses as a gay couple while Chuck falls in love with their lawyer, the beautiful but easily duped Alex McDonough (Jessica Biel).Director Dennis Dugan has a rocky history of unfunny comedies, such as National Security and Saving Silverman. However, he has managed to open up a can of laughs before with last year's The Benchwarmers and the Adam Sandler classic Happy Gilmore. In this film, he gives us a similar serving, nothing spectacular but funny enough for Friday night escapism.I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry should make you laugh. It's not consistently funny throughout, and like some of Sandler's previous works like Anger Management, some of the funny moments from the trailer don't take you by surprise any more. However, there are still plenty of moments to chuckle outside of these scenes.One of the strengths of this film, like many comedies, isn't necessarily the leading cast. Yes, Sandler and James are funny, but it's the supporting cast and bit parts that really shine. Dan Aykroyd is hilarious as Chuck and Larry's captain. Steve Buscemi is brilliant in the small part of the city fraud investigator. SNL's Rachel Dratch has a creepy yet memorable scene early on. However, it's Nick Swardson and Ving Rhames who really steal the show in their uncomfortably revealing roles.But no critique of this film would be complete without a nod to the gorgeous Jessica Biel. I know it's pandering to drop a hottie like Biel including an eye-popping scene of her in only bra and panties into a movie that is inevitably going to leave macho men cringing at times. She's more than eye candy here. She's represents a comfort zone for all the sexually insecure men watching the movie. After all, even the most fervent homophobe is going to take solace in watching Biel amidst Sandler and James almost kissing and David Spade squirming through a cameo in a bunny outfit.I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry isn't perfect by far. Too many scenes fizzle out with stale jokes and bad punch lines. However, when the movie is funny, it is hilarious. And, while it takes on the issues of gay rights, it avoids a preachy tone, which is refreshing to see in a movie nowadays.Still, you have to realise this film doesn't treat these issues tenderly. It's an Adam Sandler movie after all. Expect plenty of crass jokes and low-brow humor. And the gay community might take offense considering the fact that homosexuality is the punch line for the film. But as a gay rights film aimed at homophobic heterosexuals, it will probably reach more people than Brokeback Mountain ever did.",3,A gay rights film aimed at homophobic heterosexuals?,1195257600,"11 17, 2007",2007,3659,"[""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'wonder', 'Kevin', 'James', 'A', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'practically', 'stole', 'show', 'planting', 'kiss', 'Will', 'Smith', 'date', 'flick', 'Hitch', 'Now', 'big', 'budget', 'comedy', 'ready', 'lock', 'lips', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Maybe', 'hit', 'TV', 'show', 'King', 'Queens', 'had', 'double', 'meaning', 'Watching', 'James', 'dance', 'make-out', 'scenes', 'Sandler', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'short', 'list', 'things', 'see', 'die', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'finding', 'lot', 'funny', 'moments', 'Now', 'Pronounce', 'Chuck', 'Larry.The', 'film', 'story', 'Brooklyn', 'firefighter', 'Larry', 'Valentine', 'James', 'who', 'pension', 'jeopardy', 'failed', 'file', 'proper', 'paperwork', 'wife', 'passed', 'away', 'order', 'ensure', 'money', 'kids', 'event', 'death', 'scheme', 'keep', 'things', 'straight', 'so', 'speak.Larry', 'convinces', 'best', 'bud', 'man', 'Chuck', 'Levine', 'Sandler', 'pose', 'gay', 'husband', 'think', 'have', 'things', 'locked', 'up', 'city', 'investigation', 'relationship', 'make', 'sure', 'real', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'begrudgingly', 'carry', 'pretenses', 'gay', 'couple', 'Chuck', 'love', 'lawyer', 'beautiful', 'easily', 'duped', 'Alex', 'McDonough', 'Jessica', 'Biel', '.Director', 'Dennis', 'Dugan', 'rocky', 'history', 'unfunny', 'comedies', 'such', 'National', 'Security', 'Saving', 'Silverman', 'However', 'managed', 'open', 'up', 'can', 'laughs', 'last', 'year', 'Benchwarmers', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'classic', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'film', 'similar', 'serving', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'funny', 'enough', 'Friday', 'night', 'escapism.I', 'Now', 'Pronounce', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'should', 'make', 'laugh', 'not', 'consistently', 'funny', 'Sandler', 'previous', 'works', 'Anger', 'Management', 'funny', 'moments', 'trailer', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'surprise', 'more', 'However', 'are', 'still', 'plenty', 'moments', 'chuckle', 'scenes.One', 'strengths', 'film', 'many', 'comedies', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'leading', 'cast', 'Yes', 'Sandler', 'James', 'are', 'funny', 'supporting', 'cast', 'bit', 'parts', 'really', 'shine', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'hilarious', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'captain', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'brilliant', 'small', 'part', 'city', 'fraud', 'investigator', 'SNL', 'Rachel', 'Dratch', 'creepy', 'yet', 'memorable', 'scene', 'early', 'However', 'Nick', 'Swardson', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'who', 'really', 'steal', 'show', 'uncomfortably', 'revealing', 'roles.But', 'critique', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'nod', 'gorgeous', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'know', 'pandering', 'drop', 'hottie', 'Biel', 'including', 'eye-popping', 'scene', 'only', 'bra', 'panties', 'movie', 'inevitably', 'going', 'leave', 'macho', 'men', 'cringing', 'times', 'more', 'eye', 'candy', 'here', 'comfort', 'zone', 'sexually', 'insecure', 'men', 'watching', 'movie', 'even', 'most', 'fervent', 'homophobe', 'going', 'take', 'solace', 'watching', 'Biel', 'amidst', 'Sandler', 'James', 'almost', 'kissing', 'David', 'Spade', 'squirming', 'cameo', 'bunny', 'outfit.I', 'Now', 'Pronounce', 'Chuck', 'Larry', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'far', 'Too', 'many', 'scenes', 'fizzle', 'out', 'stale', 'jokes', 'bad', 'punch', 'lines', 'However', 'when', 'movie', 'funny', 'hilarious', 'issues', 'gay', 'rights', 'preachy', 'tone', 'refreshing', 'see', 'movie', 'nowadays.Still', 'have', 'realise', 'film', ""n't"", 'treat', 'issues', 'tenderly', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'Expect', 'plenty', 'crass', 'jokes', 'low-brow', 'humor', 'gay', 'community', 'might', 'take', 'offense', 'considering', 'fact', 'homosexuality', 'punch', 'line', 'film', 'gay', 'rights', 'film', 'aimed', 'homophobic', 'heterosexuals', 'will', 'probably', 'reach', 'more', 'people', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'ever', 'did']",N/A
1105396,A11L5M4MJP00UW,B000VXWX7E,"David L Hutchins ""Music Lover""","[2, 6]","This movie had some very funny laugh out loud moments and was entertaining all the way through.  I am not sure that a gay person would find it quite as funny as a straight person, as there were some stereotype ideas that were used to get laughs.  A good example is when all the firemen are in the shower and a couple of them drop their soap.  Knowing they have two among them who they think are gay, no one wants to bend over to pick up the soap.  Or when they are shopping to pick up items that are more ""gay"" than what they usually would buy.  I can't say that the movie makes fun of gays, as eventually everyone in the firehouse accepts the fact that they have gays working with them and eventually supports them.  Some politically incorrect moments end up being ""corrected"" by the end of the movie.  This is definitely an adult movie with adult themes, although older teens who really know what ""gay"" means probably wouldn't be shocked by anything here.  I wouldn't take my mom to see the movie and probably not my wife either.  The plot seems a bit of a stretch--that two guys had to get married to protect a pension.  I would have thought they could have found a much easier way.  It does make for a lot of comical moments such as when a very picky inspector says that their trash is not ""gay"" enough.  Some fundamentalists might be bothered by the fact that this movie is just another step closer to our acceptance in this society of openly gay behavior as being completely okay.  I think I feel as most Americans do; that what two consenting adults do behind closed doors is their own business.  What people do in public or if it involves children is different matter all together.  One of the guys in the movie does have children but the movie handles it very well and the two guys are very keenly aware of protecting the children.  When one of the children is asked what it is like to have two daddies, she says ""I don't have two daddies.  I have my daddy and my uncle.""

1105397,A2Z44AN3F2IN61,B000VXWX7E,D. K. Stokes,"[3, 5]","Firefighters Chuck (Adam Sandler) and Larry (Kevin James) are best friends. Chuck is a very single womanizer; Larry is a widower with two kids who never dates. When Larry finds out that since he didn't update his paperwork soon enough after his wife's death, his kids won't be able to get his pension if something happens to him (yeah, I found that a little hard to swallow, too, but what the heck--the reason isn't the point), he comes up with the idea of posing as a gay couple--the new relationship would give him a bureaucratically-approved reason to change his paperwork.The city official in charge of such things is suspicious, and investigates them, and they hire a lawyer (Jessica Biel) to help them out.In the meantime, they have to deal with Chuck's withdrawal from his addiction to women, which isn't helped any by his attraction to their lawyer, and discrimination from their fellow firefighters.Dan Ackroyd is fabulous as the fire chief, and Ving Rhames as a firefighter inspired to come out of the closet by Chuck and Larry's example is over-the-top but good-naturedly funny.This is, I think, a good example of how expectations affect enjoyment of a movie. I expected goofy, low-brow humor, and I found Chuck and Larry better than I'd expected. The friendship between the two men was realistic and poignant, and there was definitely a message of tolerance. Both of them, and their firefighter pals as well all end up better people at the end of the movie.However, this movie is in no way meant to be the defining movie of LGBT rights. It's not a serious movie. It's not about gays in general. It's about these two friends.

My family had seen it and were telling me about certain scenes that sounded funny.  I borrowed it from them, put it on and laughed a LOT.  The experience of 2 working class straight guys ""being gay"" as an allegiance to their friendship...I'm trying not to spoil anything here...was quite funny to watch.  Adam Sandler's character isn't so hot about the arrangement so watching his responses was quite enjoyable.  My friend thought the exact opposite with the final statement at the end, ""That was stupid.""  He didn't laugh once, I laughed throughout.The reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because this is obviously not Oscar worthy material, and despite it appearing to be tolerant of difference/gay issues there was a great deal of stereotyping going on.  Practically every gay character in the film are prancing or swishing etc, so it really reinforces stereotypes while also breaking them down.I hated the movie The Bird Cage because of the over-the-top stereotyping of the characters as every gay character was a big flaming homosexual.  I was very insulted.  Most gay people I know are not that.  Some are, most aren't.  This movie treads close to that but never really fully takes on that extreme stereotyping.A final note is that I thought this was insulting to firefighters to some degree.  They are both firefighters and they enter a home that is on fire.  The scene was ridiculous with a few nicely place, well controlled fires sitting around.  I immediately thought firefighters must see this and think it's a slap in the face.Overall, a sweet funny movie.

A lot people don't seem to like the Happy Madison films for one reason or another but I have enjoyed all of them, especially any one with Kevin James and Steve Buscemi. Those two right there are two of my favorite actors of all time, Buscemi is absolutely an amazing actor and James is brilliant. Of course the whole group when to theaters to see this and was at my house the night it was released. This is not a classic movie but it is a fun one with some great characters and James is great in this.The film follows Chuck [Sandler] and Larry [James] who are two firefighters in New York who are very much the opposite of each other. Chuck is a womanizer and Larry is still grieving over his wife and rearing two kids. It turns out that Larry can't switch is pension over to his kids so he has only one option, marry Chuck. He learns that when you marry again you can switch it to them, enter his idea for Chuck. Of course Chuck is not down with it at first but gives in for his friend and they form a domestic partnership. Of course when word gets out the city and their fellow firefighters are not happy with this, except Ving Rhames of course. Add in a beautiful woman named Jessica Biel and you have the makings for a good movie.Director Dennis Dugan does a good job and shows why he is a vet at Happy Madison films, he keeps things moving nicely and nothing seems overly done. The writers of this film did a good job although it just doesn't work all the time. Still the performers keep things going nicely such as the great Kevin James. Once again he is cast in the every man role and plays a single father very well. Adam Sandler actually makes sense in this role, don't get me wrong I like him in everything but sometimes he over does it. Jessica Biel is as lovely as ever and turns in a great performance as does the legendary Dan Aykroyd. One of the greatest actors ever Steve Buscemi is very funny as the guy trying to prove them wrong and Ving Rhames gets close to stealing the show. Nich Turturro, Allen Covert, Gary Valentine and such all turn in great performances, and Dave Matthews steals the scene he is in away from Sandler. Rob Schneider is very funny as the preacher in Canada here and David Spade is great as well.This will not win any Academy Awards but it is a good enough comedy to keep you entertained, and it is not an anti gay film like some seem to think. Sandler and company made sure to not try to offend any one. With that said this is a fun flick that I think most would enjoy, a rental for some a purchase for others.  The thing about this flick is some may find it very upsetting [still don't know why] while others may think it is fine, I think the humor and style of the film is ok. Of course the reason to see this is because of Kevin James easily but every one especially Steve Buscemi and Ving Rhames turn in great performances.All in all this is a fun movie with some off the wall moments and some good laughs. I recommend a rental first to see how you like it and then go from there. Me, I loved and own the DVD and T shirt combo. Kevin James once again does his thing and turns in another great performance.",4,"KEVIN JAMES, STEVE BUSCEMI, AND VING RHAMES",1245283200,"06 18, 2009",2009,3309,"['NOW', 'PRONOUNCE', 'YOU', 'CHUCK', 'LARRYI', 'am', 'huge', 'Kevin', 'James', 'fan', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'movie', 'was', 'extremely', 'excited', 'come', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'lot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'like', 'Happy', 'Madison', 'films', 'one', 'reason', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'especially', 'one', 'Kevin', 'James', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'two', 'right', 'are', 'two', 'favorite', 'actors', 'time', 'Buscemi', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'actor', 'James', 'brilliant', 'course', 'whole', 'group', 'when', 'theaters', 'see', 'was', 'house', 'night', 'was', 'released', 'not', 'classic', 'movie', 'fun', 'one', 'great', 'characters', 'James', 'great', 'this.The', 'film', 'Chuck', '[', 'Sandler', ']', 'Larry', '[', 'James', ']', 'who', 'are', 'two', 'firefighters', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'opposite', 'other', 'Chuck', 'womanizer', 'Larry', 'still', 'grieving', 'wife', 'rearing', 'two', 'kids', 'out', 'Larry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'switch', 'pension', 'kids', 'so', 'only', 'one', 'option', 'marry', 'Chuck', 'when', 'marry', 'again', 'can', 'switch', 'enter', 'idea', 'Chuck', 'course', 'Chuck', 'not', 'down', 'first', 'friend', 'form', 'domestic', 'partnership', 'course', 'when', 'word', 'out', 'city', 'fellow', 'firefighters', 'are', 'not', 'happy', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'course', 'Add', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'named', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'have', 'makings', 'good', 'movie.Director', 'Dennis', 'Dugan', 'good', 'job', 'why', 'vet', 'Happy', 'Madison', 'films', 'things', 'moving', 'nicely', 'nothing', 'overly', 'done', 'writers', 'film', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'time', 'Still', 'performers', 'keep', 'things', 'going', 'nicely', 'such', 'great', 'Kevin', 'James', 'Once', 'again', 'cast', 'man', 'role', 'single', 'father', 'very', 'well', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'actually', 'sense', 'role', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'like', 'everything', 'sometimes', 'over', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'as', 'lovely', 'ever', 'great', 'performance', 'legendary', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'One', 'greatest', 'actors', 'ever', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'very', 'funny', 'guy', 'trying', 'prove', 'wrong', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'close', 'stealing', 'show', 'Nich', 'Turturro', 'Allen', 'Covert', 'Gary', 'Valentine', 'such', 'turn', 'great', 'performances', 'Dave', 'Matthews', 'scene', 'away', 'Sandler', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'very', 'funny', 'preacher', 'Canada', 'here', 'David', 'Spade', 'great', 'well.This', 'will', 'not', 'win', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'good', 'enough', 'comedy', 'keep', 'entertained', 'not', 'anti', 'gay', 'film', 'seem', 'think', 'Sandler', 'company', 'made', 'sure', 'not', 'try', 'offend', 'one', 'said', 'fun', 'flick', 'think', 'most', 'would', 'enjoy', 'rental', 'purchase', 'others', 'thing', 'flick', 'may', 'find', 'very', 'upsetting', '[', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', ']', 'others', 'may', 'think', 'fine', 'think', 'humor', 'style', 'film', 'ok.', 'course', 'reason', 'see', 'Kevin', 'James', 'easily', 'one', 'especially', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'turn', 'great', 'performances.All', 'fun', 'movie', 'wall', 'moments', 'good', 'laughs', 'recommend', 'rental', 'first', 'see', 'how', 'then', 'go', 'there', 'Me', 'loved', 'own', 'DVD', 'T', 'shirt', 'combo', 'Kevin', 'James', 'once', 'again', 'thing', 'great', 'performance']",N/A

Taylor ""GFT""","[16, 28]","I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK & LARRY concerns two aggressively heterosexual fire fighters, Chuck (Sandler) and Larry (Kevin James) who get legally married for insurance purposes and then find themselves forced to play out the roles of husband and husband.  It's hardly original, but in the hands of a master of bad-taste comedy it might have been very funny.  Unfortunately, director Dennis Dugan ain't no Mel Brooks--and Adam Sandler sure ain't no Cleavon Little.Throughout the film Sandler is presented as a mighty stud and a chick super magnet--but given that Sandler is about as sexy as Wally Cox this is even more improbable than the plot itself.  We are also very obviously supposed to like him--but given that he spends the film finding ways to be obnoxious to every one who crosses his path it isn't possible to do so. I could overlook this if the film was actually funny, but it isn't: there's no wit, no cleverness, no originality, and most damning of all no heart.  We feel nothing for these people except, perhaps, a sense of gratitude that we aren't like them.When all is said and done, I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK & LARRY is simply a parade of unoriginal insults with a few minutes of ""aw, shucks, folks! We didn't really mean to offend anybody"" tacked on at the end.  Nothing is more excruciating than an unfunny comedy except a dull unfunny comedy, and this is all of that with a Hallmark card thrown in for good measure.The DVD includes several bonuses, including a couple of audio tracks with Sandler, the director, and so on--but I can't comment on them because I couldn't be bothered to learn more about a movie that was so tiresome in the first place.  If you're in the mood for bad-taste comedy, pick up a copy of PORKY'S, AMERICAN PIE, or better yet the classic BLAZING SADDLES instead.

I figured opponents would look at the plot and say, ""See?! That's why we can't legalize same-sex marriage! People will marry people just for benefits!"" Well, I was still curious, and I finally came across it at a used DVD store for $2, so I picked it up.I was pleasantly surprised.

Chuck and Larry learned a lot about compassion, people, equality, gay rights, and rights in general. The movie had a good message. I really wish they hadn't gone so far as to get married for real and just stopped at the domestic partnership thing. That was a little disrespectful. (It was also unbelievable taking into account both Chuck's flaming heterosexuality and the fact that they were already being threatened with jail time.)So Chuck and Larry learned a lesson and the movie had a good message. However... I can't imagine anyone who is strongly opposed to gay rights actually sitting down and watching this movie. They will say, ""SEE?! That's why we can't..."" without even giving it a chance.

Kevin James didn't make a wise decision choosing to make an Adam Sandler movie as his first movie since the King of Queens series finale. I mean when did the Happy Madison company ever make anyone a star ? Plus King of Queens was way funnier than this movie. He basically just ended the show to just play...Doug Heffernan making believe he's gay. If he made believe he was gay in the show though, it would have actually been funny since the show had better writing.We don't get much new from Sandler either. He once again just plays a jerk that everyone likes for no good reason. I mean we're supposed to believe that Jame's character would want him to be the caregiver of his kids if something happened him. While he's such a father figure that he leaves the toilet seat down and also does something bad and blames it on one of the kids. We also get the same sort of unrealistic court scene that we have seen in like 4 other Sandler scenes before this. Where everyone is cheering for Sandler's character like they are at a sporting event.

1105419,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000VXWX7E,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[2, 2]","I must admit sometimes my expectations for a movie tend to get a bit too high; of course this isn't completely my fault, mind you. Generally it's caused by what I see in the previews or who the actors/actresses are that are starring in the film, or who the director is, or maybe just the subject matter. Whatever the case, there are times that I get excited to see a movie and whether I just expected too much or whatever, the movie just flat out lets me down and I leave the experience wishing I could get my time back. A recent example of this occurrence would be the Adam Sandler (""Reign Over Me"") led comedy ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"", also starring Kevin James (TV's ""King of Queens"") and Jessica Biel (""Stealth"").""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" is the story of two firemen, Chuck (Adam Sanlder) and Larry (Kevin James), best friends who would do anything for each other. After Larry's wife passed away, and some forgetfulness on his part regarding necessary paperwork noting his spouse's passing, Larry discovers that his department's benefits will not cover his children should something happen to him, that is unless he is legally married. With such a hazardous job and the thought of leaving his kids with nothing looming over him, Larry does the only thing he can think to do, marry his best friend Chuck. However, by making this choice they must convince the rest of the world that their gay marriage is completely real, and this will prove to not be such an easy task for these two completely straight guys.The previews for this movie portrayed the film as a laugh out loud comedy that by all rights would have me hurting from laughter. I mean with subject matter such as straight guys posing as homosexuals the possibility for comic gold was obvious. However, the result was somewhat lacking and the movie was left feeling overly long, with a thin story line that seemed to have way too many lulls between laughs, and way too politically correct for its own good. `Chuck and Larry' wound up being yet another movie that had a great preview that completely sold me on the film, but when I got to the actual movie I had already seen all the good stuff in the preview.As a fan of Adam Sandler, I've gotta say I expected much more from him here. Comically this had to have been his absolute weakest film to date. Sure the stuff that was shown in the previews was funny, but that's pretty much all there was. I felt that it seemed like Sandler was playing it safe with this movie, not wanting to possibly offend anyone, therefore all the jokes and comic situations were watered down to fit into our politically correct world. This wasn't the only problem I had with Adam in this movie though; he also acted as if he wasn't really into the role of Chuck. Most of his scenes were so flat and boring that I was surprised the director actually accepted them for the movie. Kevin James was much better in the role of Larry, but even his funniest moments were shown in the previews. I will say that Kevin did have one of the most dramatic scenes, and possibly one of the best scenes, in the movie when he had to face the fact that his wife had died and it was time for him to move on. Kevin played the scene so well, his pain was so genuine and him talking to his wife as if she were in the room with him was such a nice touch to fully illustrate just how connected he still was to her and how hard letting go has been for him. The rest of the cast was decent, Jessica Biel was a good choice for the eye candy role of the movie, and her role didn't require much on her part other than looking sexy, which isn't much of a stretch for her. Steve Buscemi as the slimy, somewhat creepy government employee attempting to prove that Chuck and Larry's relationship is a sham was perfect and it's a role he always handles so well. Ving Rhames and David Spade made several funny appearances that were surprising and enjoyable, but didn't really add much to elevate the movie above being a below average comedy. The biggest surprise out of the entire cast was Rob Schneider as the oriental minister, I normally get a small kick out of Schneider's cameos in each of Sandler's comedies, but this role was probably his best to date. He was so hilarious in the few scenes he was in, actually stealing the spotlight from Adam and Kevin in those instances, and I was left wishing that his character actually had more to do in the film, and maybe then the movie would have been better.Truthfully, ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" would have been a better movie if it would have trimmed down the running time by about thirty minutes. Most comedies are only 90 minutes, very few actually try for the two hour mark, and those that do are smart enough to cram enough jokes and maybe even a little drama to fill in the space, but `Chuck and Larry' apparently went for the less is more approach to fill in their two hour run time, and the decision backfired massively. Had I not seen all the funny parts in the previews (and they were funny, enough to get my expectations up), the running time been shorter, and the jokes not been so politically correct, then I think this movie could have been the laugh out loud comedy I was expecting it to be. But often times what we expect is rarely what we actually get.""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" is rated PG-13 for language and sexual references.",2,How Far Would You Go For a

1105424,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B000VXWX7E,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[12, 19]","Since I'm having such a hard time getting this review posted, I guess I'll start with the warning that there might be potential spoilers ahead.Kevin James plays Larry Valentine, a Brooklyn firefighter whose wife died three years ago and left him to raise their two children alone. Larry was so distraught over his loss and was too busy grieving to change the beneficiary of his pension from his wife to his two children. Now, three years later, he is told that there was a limited amount of time he had in which to make the change (1 year) and that now changes can only be made in the event of a birth, death, or marriage. Larry chooses the latter. He asks his best friend in the fire department, the brazenly, openly, defiantly heterosexual Chuck, played by Adam Sandler, if he will help by pretending to be his domestic partner so that Chuck can be named the beneficiary and take care of Larry's two kids if anything happens. Chuck (wonder of wonders) agrees. And so begins I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.The problem begins, of course, when the state decides to investigate their domestic partnership. Chuck and Larry consult a lawyer (played by the ridiculously good looking Jessica Biel in what might be the film's only saving grace) who tells them that one way to throw the state off their scent is to go to Canada and ""make it legal."" Now married, the two men find them involved in one bad situation after the next. Chuck is having a hard time eschewing his womanizer past and Larry is so busy trying to keep his family together, be a role model for his daughter, and get his effeminate son to be more interested in sports that he doesn't necessarily have time to play the part of the happy husband. Their friends begin to ostracize them, the media gets wind of the fact that there are two gay firefighters and won't leave them alone, and the whole reason they got together (for the children) is being put in jeopardy by their legal problems.I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry had good intentions, but that still doesn't make it right. Most of the jokes fell flat, half the time they were defending homosexual unions, I felt they were actually degrading them, and the very idea that any couple would be together for months without anyone seeing them physically interact (a hug, a kiss, a touch, even) is ridiculous. Furthermore, not only were homosexuals depicted in a negative light, nothing was ever done to detract from this idea (though I will admit efforts were made).

In terrible agony, I just want you all to know that this film is DEFINITELY not for me. It's too bad that the actors I know (Kevin James and Adam Sandler) were too busy goofing around alot to completely save it! What the hell was  going on inside their heads? It's not like Kevin to let us down with 2 bad movies. No, I didn't like Paul Blart Mall Cop either, I'll save that fart riot for next time. Anyway, Kevin and Adam's characters Chuck and Larry are 2 dedicated firefighters. They rush towards every fire mishap and take care of the situation, then smile about it when it's over because they know their paychecks are looking good. Next thing you know, they almost came so close to Death's Door, they are rushed to the hospital, they recovered within days, and after that they got out, Larry had this incredibly,dumb idea that he suggested that the only way for them to share Chuck's mutual funds is to become Gay Partners! Hey, wait a minute, isn't this the same movie plot from ""Strange Bedfellows""!? Yes? No? Oh, Okay, So, In order to make this lousy plan work to their advantage, they go and meet the beautiful and lovely Jessica Biel. While she's doing all the talking in her office, Chuck admires her smile and her fine booty, he is not playing this gay card correctly. Larry just wants to get down to business so they try so hard to play this out. And to my surprise, it blows up in their faces because it causes them to aurgue more, they're invaded by other gay males, Chuck can't stop seeing Jessica's character,nor can he stop touching her boobs(Lord, have mercy on her body, for it is the temple of God.) Ving Rhames reminises Holiday Heart again and their wedding was a complete embarrasment.

I really loved the Kevin James and Adam Sandler combination.  They worked well off each other and together made this an excellent movie full of laughs.There is the typical funny yet silly humour you'd expect throughout from Adam Sandler with a funny yet more serious side of Kevin.  His kids may not get his pension if anything should happen to him (he and Adam are both firefighters) as he's a single parent (his wife died a year or so back).  As predictably as you already know he marries Chuck and has to keep up the appearance that they are an actual couple so they aren't found out by the government.  Chuck owes a favour to Larry after Larry saved his life and so he honours it (unexcitedly) by doing this as he can see how much Larry's kids mean to him and how much they need their dad now that their mom has died.  Chuck falls in love with their attorney and the rest is exactly as you might imagine.It is very entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable.  If you love Adam Sandler, you'll love this.

1105436,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B000VXWX7E,Mark Turner,"[2, 3]","Contemporary lifestyles have always led to comic films that either make light of those lifestyles or recognize them through comedic eyes. I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK AND LARRY does the latter.Larry (Kevin James) and Chuck (Adam Sandler) are two New York firefighters who risk their lives daily. The two are close partners who would do anything for each other. Larry is a single father trying to raise two kids. Chuck is a womanizer of the highest order. So it only seems natural the two would end up together, right?Having lost his wife three years earlier, Larry discovers that since he didn't switch beneficiaries within a year, he can no longer do so. He's stuck unless he remarries.During a search of a building once the fire is out, Chuck falls and Larry catches him, saving his life. The two recuperate and one night while reading the newspaper, Larry comes up with an idea. Rushing to Chuck's house he offers a plan for the pair to pretend to be homosexual partners to set up his benefits. The promise that no one will ever find out is a comic setup if ever there was one.The two pretend but worry about what would happen if caught. A visit to an attorney (Jessica Biehl) results in their learning significant fraud charges could be filed. Its through her they learn that one way to avoid investigation is to actually marry. Off to Niagra Falls!All goes well until a checker from the benefits department shows at Larry's home expecting to see the loving couple together. Now the two must not only pretend to be married but live together as well. And when more intensive investigations ensue, they do everything they can to prove they are a gay couple to the people who matter.Sound complicated? Well perhaps the set up is but the jokes are simple and frequent. Not to mention most revolving around the preconceived notions of gays that people have been fed for years. Stereotypes run rampant but are used to make a point. Through it all both men learn about their friendship, the intolerance of others and begin to open up their own minds discovering that perhaps things aren't what they seem.Sandler turns in his usual solid performance, playing the Brooklyn tough guy to the hilt. James does a stand up job as the beleaguered parent doing what he needs to take care of his family. Biehl does more than look pretty, showing a comedic side not seen before.

1105441,A3CKOFIE4TEW7N,B000VXWX7E,Michael Greenwaldt,"[7, 10]","Don't be fooled by the name Alexander Payne (Election, About Schmidt, Sideways) being attached to this movie, as most of what you will see is not the movie he had in mind when he wrote the initial draft of the screenplay. According to Payne, Sandler took many liberties with his screenplay and ""Sandlerized"" the movie. Payne eventually didn't even want his name attached to this project. I can't say I blame him at all. Payne would never be responsible for this drivel. How unfortunate that what was probably a really good script with the potential to be a really good movie with a good message ended up as this. The movie is the equivalent of a backstabber, or maybe someone with a multiple personality disorder. One minute it's being disgustingly crass and offensive to the gay community, and the next it's unconvincingly preaching that homophobia is bad. Who knows where the movie actually stands on the issue. It tries to make you think it's pro-gay but I'm not sure I buy it. It's almost as if the creators of the movie have never met a gay person. There is not a single gay character in this movie that really rings true. They're over-the-top caricatures; either overly feminine or slightly creepy, or both. There's not a single character in this movie that acts like your average joe who just happens to be gay.I've never had a problem with Adam Sandler. But after this I find it really hard to have any respect for him. Every idiotic joke made me like him less. And it's not just jabs at gay people. There's an offensive scene in the beginning where they rescue a severely overweight guy from a burning building that has to be seen to be believed. It's just really uncalled for and in extremely poor taste. Nothing about this is funny. The only people who will find it to be so are ones with an utterly juvenile sense of humor. There's also Rob Schneider's offensive portrayal of Asians. Honestly, this is one of the most mean-spirited mainstream comedies of the year and the more I think about it, the more I dislike it. There were a few laughs to be had, but mostly it just made me mad by its annoying insensitivity.While this was in theaters I was talking to someone who said they'd went to see this, and they said that it gives you something to think about. I found this kind of funny, especially now after seeing it. How could anyone take anything away from this movie? I had thought maybe in its own way it would do some good by opening the minds of Sandler fans with its dumbed down message about tolerance, but that was before seeing it. Now I can't imagine it doing much to further acceptance. It's not the worst thing for the gay community, but it's just too two-faced to be something positive. Thank you Adam Sandler for turning the serious issue of gay rights into a movie filled with fart and boobie jokes. Not to mention the several uses of the ""F"" word used throughout. And of course, for some odd reason, Chuck and Larry are treated as heroes for pretending to be gay in order to scam the system, making a mockery out of homosexuals in the process. And their support comes from the gay community no less. How unrealistic is that? I can't imagine homosexuals would be so supportive if something like this really happened. I guess it's just trying to fool itself into believing that, as a movie, it's doing us a favor and is a friend to the gay community. Well, some friend. It's certainly one we can do without.Grade: 5/10 (C-)",2,"A two-faced ""comedy""",1194307200,"11 6, 2007",2007,3450,"['Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'name', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'Election', 'About', 'Schmidt', 'Sideways', 'being', 'attached', 'movie', 'most', 'what', 'will', 'see', 'not', 'movie', 'had', 'mind', 'when', 'wrote', 'initial', 'draft', 'screenplay', 'According', 'Payne', 'Sandler', 'took', 'many', 'liberties', 'screenplay', 'Sandlerized', 'movie', 'Payne', 'eventually', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'name', 'attached', 'project', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'blame', 'Payne', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'responsible', 'drivel', 'How', 'unfortunate', 'what', 'was', 'probably', 'really', 'good', 'script', 'potential', 'be', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'message', 'ended', 'up', 'movie', 'equivalent', 'backstabber', 'maybe', 'someone', 'multiple', 'personality', 'disorder', 'One', 'minute', 'being', 'disgustingly', 'crass', 'offensive', 'gay', 'community', 'next', 'unconvincingly', 'preaching', 'homophobia', 'bad', 'Who', 'where', 'movie', 'actually', 'issue', 'make', 'think', 'pro-gay', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'buy', 'almost', 'creators', 'movie', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'gay', 'person', 'not', 'single', 'gay', 'character', 'movie', 'really', 'true', ""'re"", 'over-the-top', 'caricatures', 'overly', 'feminine', 'slightly', 'creepy', 'not', 'single', 'character', 'movie', 'average', 'joe', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'gay.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'problem', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'find', 'really', 'hard', 'have', 'respect', 'Every', 'idiotic', 'joke', 'made', 'less', 'not', 'just', 'jabs', 'gay', 'people', 'offensive', 'scene', 'beginning', 'where', 'rescue', 'severely', 'overweight', 'guy', 'burning', 'building', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'just', 'really', 'uncalled', 'extremely', 'poor', 'taste', 'Nothing', 'funny', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'so', 'are', 'ones', 'utterly', 'juvenile', 'sense', 'humor', 'also', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'offensive', 'portrayal', 'Asians', 'Honestly', 'one', 'most', 'mean-spirited', 'mainstream', 'comedies', 'year', 'more', 'think', 'more', 'dislike', 'were', 'few', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'mostly', 'just', 'made', 'mad', 'annoying', 'insensitivity.While', 'was', 'theaters', 'was', 'talking', 'someone', 'who', 'said', ""'d"", 'went', 'see', 'said', 'something', 'think', 'found', 'kind', 'funny', 'especially', 'now', 'seeing', 'How', 'could', 'anyone', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'movie', 'had', 'thought', 'maybe', 'own', 'way', 'would', 'do', 'good', 'opening', 'minds', 'Sandler', 'fans', 'dumbed', 'down', 'message', 'tolerance', 'was', 'seeing', 'Now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'doing', 'much', 'further', 'acceptance', 'not', 'worst', 'thing', 'gay', 'community', 'just', 'too', 'two-faced', 'be', 'something', 'positive', 'Thank', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'turning', 'serious', 'issue', 'gay', 'rights', 'movie', 'filled', 'fart', 'boobie', 'jokes', 'Not', 'mention', 'several', 'uses', 'F', 'word', 'used', 'course', 'odd', 'reason', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'are', 'treated', 'heroes', 'pretending', 'be', 'gay', 'order', 'scam', 'system', 'making', 'mockery', 'homosexuals', 'process', 'support', 'gay', 'community', 'less', 'How', 'unrealistic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'homosexuals', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'supportive', 'something', 'really', 'happened', 'guess', 'just', 'trying', 'fool', 'believing', 'that', 'movie', 'doing', 'favor', 'friend', 'gay', 'community', 'Well', 'friend', 'certainly', 'one', 'can', 'do', 'without.Grade', '5/10', 'C-']",N/A

Valentine is a single father whos wife passed away. Levine is the womanizer who like Bill CLinton, cant get enough (Sorry for the slick Willy joke). Larry realizes that there are problems with his pension and when the both of them get hurt, Larry finds out that he needs a significant other to have full pension benefits. When Larry saves Chuck in a previously burned out warehouse, Larry cooks up a scheme to become Chucks domestic parter so he can get full pension benefits. Chuck cautiously accepts and trouble ensues. Steve Buscemi is sent to stamp Chuck and Larry's marriage as a fraud. Also the lawyer who is watching out for Chuck and Larry is the incredible and sexy Jessica Biel (7th Heaven). Can Chuck calm his hormones.....when he becomes ""friends"" with Alex (Biel). Will Chuck confess when Alex lets Chuck feel her chest? Will everyone press stop after the scene when Jessica Biel is in her underwear? Will Chuck and Larry's captain (Dan Ackroyd from Ghostbusters) go to jail as Alex mentioned in a similar case?

Second, the movie is just under 2 hours in length, not 1 hr and 16 minutes as stated on Amazon.Now to the movie itself.  First of, this is Adam Sandler's first movie where his character is Jewish, as the actor is in real life.  As such, there are the occasional Jewish humor that anyone can appreciate.  Second, as a movie about two men pretending to be gay, there is actually not that much humor relating to homosexuality; which is good as that would become tiresome really quick.  And most of the gay humor is wordplay, with very little crude, physical humor.Third, as an Oriental person, I did find Rob Schneider's Japanese impersonation hilarious, and not overly insulting.  Like all other Sandler movies' this one has a moral undercurrent.  In this case, it is that gays are no different than heterosexuals.  Also, one should always support their friends.  This movie is classic Sandler, and also a great big-screen breakout role for Kevin James.

I say that this is a film that ought to be judged precisely for what it is.  It's not extraordinary and it's not preachy...it's simply a film that sends a message in a way that works for it.  Well, message recieved.  While this film is a comedy (come on, it's Adam Sandler), it's jokes are funny and do not really stray into the relm of being offensive.  And, if it does so, it does so because it's supposed to and it is then handled with the proper respect and attitude.  For me, Kevin James is the star of the film, but that could be largely because he stays pretty grounded in comparison to Mr. Sandler's antics, even if those antics remain pretty tame in comparison to some of the man's other works.  I wasn't particularly impressed by Jessica Biel's performance, even if there seemed to be some genuine passion behind her character's actions.  Overall, I think this film worked because individuals involved in the campaign for gay rights took part in this movie...it just give it this stronger sense of credibility, which is impressive as it's an Adam Sandler comedy.

1105461,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000VXWX7E,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","***1/2In ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry,"" Adam Sandler and Kevin James play two New York City fire fighters who pretend to be gay so that Larry's two kids can be raised by Chuck in the event of Larry's untimely death (Larry`s wife has been dead for two years and he has not been able to bring himself to date another woman in all that time).  The hitch is that to bring this about, the two of them will have to officially register as ""domestic partners.""  Originally, they intend on keeping their ""relationship"" an on-paper-only deal, but when the government starts sending inspectors around to verify the validity of their claim, Chuck and Larry are left with the choice of admitting to the scam and going to jail or convincing everyone around them that they are indeed an actual couple.As a ""high concept"" comedy, ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" is pretty much a contrived manufacture from the get-go, mixing equal parts humor and sentiment in an attempt to play to the broadest possible audience - which is probably the only way the filmmakers could reasonably have gone with material this dicey.  Yet, while the movie traffics in any number of lame stereotypes (gay as well as ethnic), it also has some important things to say about equality and acceptance in an ever changing world.  The script achieves about a 50/50 ration in its humor - about half the jokes are zingers while the other half are clunkers - but the movie's heart is definitely in the right place, so much so that you will forgive the filmmakers when the story turns all heavy-handed and preachy towards the end, in what is surely one of the least plausible courtroom scenes in motion picture history.  As compensation, the movie actually places its characters in some pretty sticky moral dilemmas at times, the prime one being that, much as we may like and admire Chuck and Larry for all the social barriers they are tearing down, we still hear that little nagging voice in the back of our heads telling us that they are defrauding the public and breaking the law while doing so.  Such moral ambiguity is actually a pretty rare commodity for a mainstream American comedy these days.Sandler and James imbue their roles with a great deal of charm and gusto, and they receive strong support from Dan Aykroyd, Jessica Biel, Ving Rhames and Steve Buscemi.""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" certainly isn't up to the level of ""Knocked Up"" or ""Superbad,"" its summer 2007 comedy contemporaries, but neither is it the cinematic disaster most of the critics have accused it of being.

1105467,A10BT85QEKBZNZ,B000VXWX7E,SMS CA,"[2, 5]","I Now Pronounce You Chuck and LarryBy: Maddie EmbreeThis movie is absolutely hilarious, but yet at the same time touching peoples hearts with the brother hood between the main characters Larry valentine, (played by Kevin James) and Chuck Levine,  (played by Adam Sandler). The life lesson of this movie is a good friend will go to the end of the world and back to help a friend. Although it is hysterical, there is one scene that completely over did the whole family movie title. If you have seen this you should know exactly what I'm talking about. If you haven't you will as soon as you watch this movie. This scene takes place in the lawyers house after a so called ""girls day"". In this scene the lawyer (played by Jessica Biel) changes in front of chuck who is only pretending to be a homosexual. I feel like some of the younger kids might have not need to see that. I know they rated it PG-13 but it's not like they aren't going to watch it sometime. One of the funniest scenes takes place at the party when Chuck and Larry meet the lawyers brother Kevin (played by Nick Swardson). As they are leaving a group protesting against homosexuality surrounds them. Chuck decides is trying his hardest to make them leave but they will not. As the chuck and his group were leaving the man calls them ""fagots"". Chuck walks back and asks, ""what did u just call me""? and the man decides to say it to his face through a mega-phone. Chuck turns around as if he is walking away and then turns sharply turns and punches the man to the ground. This is an excellent movie to show your older children to teach them the lessons of what being a good friend is all about. I would say the ages appropriate for this movie would be 12 and up. Well I do not want to give any thing else away. If u have not seen it, it is a must to have on DVD.
