If it had the full 24-26 episode format in which to really develop the characters and allow the writers to have fun within the arc, the show would outrageously funny. And with more character developing (mainly Prince Baka) the ending, decent as it is, would be that more satisfactory.Over all, I'm glad to have it in my collection.",4,A decent anime...,1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,434,"['humor', 'good', 'suffers', 'number', 'other', 'anime', 'titles', 'due', '13', 'episode', 'format', 'had', 'full', '24-26', 'episode', 'format', 'really', 'develop', 'characters', 'allow', 'writers', 'have', 'fun', 'arc', 'show', 'would', 'outrageously', 'funny', 'more', 'character', 'developing', 'mainly', 'Prince', 'Baka', 'ending', 'decent', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'satisfactory.Over', ""'m"", 'glad', 'have', 'collection']",Level E: Complete Series

Should Yukitaka believe him - on either count?Level E is a short series from the author of Yu Yu Hakusho and Hunter x Hunter, but it is quite different from his big hits. It works out as a series of short stories, around 2-3 episodes in length (the series is 13 episodes total). The main character is quite probably insane, but lots of fun to watch. I've read the manga and watched the anime. The manga has a bit more of a horror aspect, while the anime is almost pure comedy, but the stories are the same (as far as I remember).If you enjoyedYu Yu HakushoorHunter x Hunter, or simply like sci-fi comedy, then you should give Level E a shot.",4,An Amnesiac Alien Prince?,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,874,"['Tsutsui', 'Yukitaka', 'high', 'school', 'freshman', 'living', 'own', 'least', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'own', 'When', 'arrived', 'new', 'apartment', 'occupied', 'young', 'man', 'claiming', 'have', 'amnesia', 'be', 'alien', 'Should', 'Yukitaka', 'believe', 'count', 'Level', 'E', 'short', 'series', 'author', 'Yu', 'Yu', 'Hakusho', 'Hunter', 'x', 'Hunter', 'quite', 'different', 'big', 'hits', 'out', 'series', 'short', 'stories', '2-3', 'episodes', 'length', 'series', '13', 'episodes', 'total', 'main', 'character', 'quite', 'probably', 'insane', 'lots', 'fun', 'watch', ""'ve"", 'read', 'manga', 'watched', 'anime', 'manga', 'bit', 'more', 'horror', 'aspect', 'anime', 'almost', 'pure', 'comedy', 'stories', 'are', 'same', 'as', 'far', 'remember', '.If', 'enjoyedYu', 'Yu', 'HakushoorHunter', 'x', 'Hunter', 'simply', 'sci-fi', 'comedy', 'then', 'should', 'give', 'Level', 'E', 'shot']",Level E: Complete Series
