576973,A1VJ7HYM1EC94M,B00005AFO3,"G P Padillo ""paolo""","[38, 40]","Very Annie Mary took me by shock and delightful surprise.Rachel Griffiths (Hillary to Emily Watson's Jacqueline Du Pre) gives herfinest performance to date - and though the film is 3 years old Griffithshasn't as yet done anything quite as satisfying as her brilliant turn here asAnnie Mary.33 year old, Annie comes off as mildly retarded, and, in the purest senseof the word, is, since life was pretty much over for her at 15. That's whenAnnie Mary, who's dream was to be an opera singer, won a national vocalcompetition judged by Pavarotti.  The Great Tenor told her she would have amarvelous career, and awarded her the grand prize, a grant to study fulltime study in Milan.Unfortunately, that same week, her mother took ill, died.  Her dreamsdashed, Annie is forced to take her mother's place at home. Her fatheraccomplishes his means of keeping Annie underfoot (disturbingly, and at onepoint, literally) by constant humiliation of his daughter, reminding hershe isn't special, she isn't, in fact, anything at all.As Pugh, her father, Jonathan Pryce is terrific: selfish, cold hearted andalmost two decades after he's shattered her dreams, the man still beratesas "" talentless, useless, stupid, slovenly . . . what man would ever haveyou?""  Oh yeah, Dad forces her to dress in his dead mother's shapeless,matronly shifts as he constantly regaling Annie of how beautiful her motherwas.The film opens with Pryce singing Puccini's Nessun Dorma through mountedspeakers atop his bakery delivery truck as he steers through the Welshcountryside as ""The Voice of the Valleys"". As the camera pulls in, wesee ""The Voice of the Valley"" in a rubber Pavarotti mask and a Pavarottisized tuxedo. And we get the entire aria.  If for nothing else, thisopening scene is worth the price of the film.  And it only gets better fromthere!While not slapstick Griffiths' Annie Mary is prone toward extremeclumsiness - moving (especially when running) like an excited 5 year old,all stiff arms and awkwardness. She's adorable. Clumsiness leads to minoraccidents, falling down stairs, running into doors - each moment hilariousyet making ugly duckling even more endearing.  Annie teaches voice lessonsand we get to see her in action as she instructs a young gay couple with adream to go to America and, star with Dolly Parton in ""Annie Get YourGun.""  Amazing.The heart of the film centers around Annie's relationship the villagers andher best friend, Bethan, a bedridden teenager half her age. The villager'swish for Bethan is to send her to Disneyland, however her own true and onlywish is to, at least once, hear Annie sing.Through an unlikely series of events - including a talent competition, abouncing Pavarotti, the Village People, the Welsh Grand National Horseraceand the entire village turning against Annie) Bethan - and the village -finally get to hear Annie Mary find her voice again. It is a magical momentblending, forgiveness, hope, pathos and Puccini, as Annie Mary finds notonly her voice, but the strength to carry on.Very Annie Mary is easily one of the most joyous DVD discoveries I've yetmade.",5,A Love Song to Life,1096416000,"09 29, 2004",2004,3091,"['Very', 'Annie', 'Mary', 'took', 'shock', 'delightful', 'surprise.Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'Hillary', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Jacqueline', 'Du', 'Pre', 'herfinest', 'performance', 'date', 'film', '3', 'years', 'old', 'Griffithshas', ""n't"", 'as', 'yet', 'done', 'anything', 'quite', 'as', 'satisfying', 'brilliant', 'turn', 'here', 'asAnnie', 'Mary.33', 'year', 'old', 'Annie', 'off', 'mildly', 'retarded', 'purest', 'senseof', 'word', 'life', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', '15', 'whenAnnie', 'Mary', 'who', 'dream', 'was', 'be', 'opera', 'singer', 'won', 'national', 'vocalcompetition', 'judged', 'Pavarotti', 'Great', 'Tenor', 'told', 'would', 'have', 'amarvelous', 'career', 'awarded', 'grand', 'prize', 'grant', 'study', 'fulltime', 'study', 'Milan.Unfortunately', 'same', 'week', 'mother', 'took', 'ill', 'died', 'Her', 'dreamsdashed', 'Annie', 'forced', 'take', 'mother', 'place', 'home', 'fatheraccomplishes', 'means', 'keeping', 'Annie', 'underfoot', 'disturbingly', 'onepoint', 'literally', 'constant', 'humiliation', 'daughter', 'reminding', 'hershe', ""n't"", 'special', ""n't"", 'fact', 'anything', 'all.As', 'Pugh', 'father', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'terrific', 'selfish', 'cold', 'hearted', 'andalmost', 'two', 'decades', 'shattered', 'dreams', 'man', 'still', 'talentless', 'useless', 'stupid', 'slovenly', 'what', 'man', 'would', 'ever', 'haveyou', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'Dad', 'dress', 'dead', 'mother', 'shapeless', 'matronly', 'constantly', 'regaling', 'Annie', 'how', 'beautiful', 'motherwas.The', 'film', 'Pryce', 'singing', 'Puccini', 'Nessun', 'Dorma', 'mountedspeakers', 'bakery', 'delivery', 'truck', 'Welshcountryside', 'Voice', 'Valleys', 'camera', 'wesee', 'Voice', 'Valley', 'rubber', 'Pavarotti', 'mask', 'Pavarottisized', 'tuxedo', 'get', 'entire', 'aria', 'nothing', 'else', 'thisopening', 'scene', 'price', 'film', 'only', 'better', 'fromthere', 'not', 'slapstick', 'Griffiths', 'Annie', 'Mary', 'prone', 'extremeclumsiness', 'moving', 'especially', 'when', 'running', 'excited', '5', 'year', 'old', 'stiff', 'arms', 'awkwardness', 'adorable', 'Clumsiness', 'minoraccidents', 'falling', 'down', 'stairs', 'running', 'doors', 'moment', 'hilariousyet', 'making', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'even', 'more', 'endearing', 'Annie', 'voice', 'lessonsand', 'get', 'see', 'action', 'young', 'gay', 'couple', 'adream', 'go', 'America', 'star', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'Annie', 'Get', 'YourGun', 'Amazing.The', 'heart', 'film', 'centers', 'Annie', 'relationship', 'villagers', 'andher', 'best', 'friend', 'Bethan', 'bedridden', 'teenager', 'half', 'age', ""villager'swish"", 'Bethan', 'send', 'Disneyland', 'however', 'own', 'true', 'onlywish', 'least', 'once', 'hear', 'Annie', 'unlikely', 'series', 'events', 'including', 'talent', 'competition', 'abouncing', 'Pavarotti', 'Village', 'People', 'Welsh', 'Grand', 'National', 'Horseraceand', 'entire', 'village', 'turning', 'Annie', 'Bethan', 'village', '-finally', 'get', 'hear', 'Annie', 'Mary', 'find', 'voice', 'again', 'magical', 'momentblending', 'forgiveness', 'hope', 'pathos', 'Puccini', 'Annie', 'Mary', 'notonly', 'voice', 'strength', 'carry', 'on.Very', 'Annie', 'Mary', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'joyous', 'DVD', 'discoveries', ""'ve"", 'yetmade']",Very Annie Mary
576974,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005AFO3,Grady Harp,"[6, 6]","VERY ANNIE MARY is a quirky little film written and directed by Sara Sugarman that manages to delve into myriad fantasies and manners and crushed dreams and come out with a thoroughly tender, warm hearted and funny result.  There are more interesting characters of all types in this story, each of whom could be expanded into a film  all their own.After a rollicking opening sequence of a bakery delivery van topped with speakers blasting Puccini's 'Nessun dorma' over lovely countryside of Wales - the driver is the town baker Jack Pugh (Jonathan Pryce) who wears a rubber mask and bloated suit that mimic Pavarotti singing along with a recording - we meet the town folk. Jack's daughter Annie Mary (Rachel Griffiths) is in her 30s, stuck as a surrogate wife and slave to her father and his bakery business. She seems loopy and perhaps retarded (socially indeed, if not a bit mentally) and has borne the brunt of her father's scorn since her mother died when she was fifteen, just when Annie had won a singing competition judged by Pavarotti.  The loss of her mother places her in the role of 'wife' to the dastardly John who daily convinces her she is a nothing while he pursues his avocation of singing for the townsfolk  as the Voice of the Valley.  Annie's only remnant of her past survives in her teaching voice lessons to such odd folk as Hob (Ioan Gruffudd) and Nob (Matthew Rhys), gay friends of hers with delusions of Hollywood.  Her closest friend is teenage Bethan (Joanna Page) who is ill.Annie Mary spies a house on the market, desperately wants to get out from under her father's control to make a life of her own, and shares this with Bethan.  During one of his concerts John collapses with a stroke and it appears Annie's dreams of independence are crushed.  The townsfolk decide they want to befriend Bethan and monies are gathered to send Bethan on her 'dream' - a trip to Disneyland.  In a hilarious talent show meant to raise funds for the Disneyland trip Annie and her friends win the contest and the money meant for Bethan's trip is entrusted to Annie.  Annie again stumbles and squanders the funds on her own dreams by buying sensual satisfaction.  Broken by her own mistake, Annie confesses to Bethan and Bethan replies that her only dream before dying is to hear Annie sing.  And sing Annie does, in probably the most touching performance of Puccini's 'O mio bambino caro'. At last Annie Mary has regained her self-respect and has a glimpse of her own life.  The closing multiple resolutions of the film are full of surprises of the best kind.Every character in this delightful film is well acted, but there are moments by some, like the very weird, besotted minister (Kenneth Griffith), that certainly deserve awards for brilliance.VERY ANNIE MARY is a rich, multilayered, magical film with outstanding performances by Rachel Griffiths and Jonathan Pryce.  The only fault one might find is that much of the dialogue is indecipherable due to the Welsh accents that challenge the ear!  Highly recommended.

576976,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005AFO3,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","I read where John Irving said recently that he always writes the end of his story first, and I have the feeling that writer-director Sara Sugarman did something along those lines with ""Very Annie Mary.""  That is because there is a great ending to this one, or at least a great climax (how much you will think of the denouement is debatable).  I know that part of it is being on emotional edge this week watching the news from New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, but I really think that Sugarman provides a transcendent ending to the story of Annie Mary Pugh (Rachel Griffiths), who lives in a town in Wales.  That explains why everybody speaks in a Welsh accent, not that we can imitate such the way we do an English, Irish or Scotch accent (ever notice in Shakespeare's ""Henry V"" that the comic relief is provided by four men: an Englishman, an Irishman, a Scott, and a Welshman; so that there are four different accents at play in their conversations).Annie Mary's father, Jack (Jonathan Pryce), runs the local bakery and not only likes to sing like Pavarotti over the speaker system of his truck as he makes his deliveries, he dresses up like the great tenor (including a mask).  Annie Mary used to sing too, and even won a contest 15 years ago that earned her a chance to study in Milan.  But then her mother died and Annie Mary has not sung since.  For reasons that only become clear if you think about it at the end, her father treats her abominably.  For her birthday he gives her a cabbage, and when he is cold he makes her curl around his feet.  Annie Mary has no luck with the boys in town, even though she offers to pay one for a kiss.  Her best friend is Bethan Bevan (Joanna Page), a bedridden 16-year-old who is quite ill.  It is only with Bethan that Annie Mary can watch the silent videotape of her and her mother 15 years ago when they were happy.  Meanwhile, the mayor wants to raise money to send Bethan to Disneyland and Annie Mary would like to help.Then her father suffers a stroke, and the responsibility for taking care of him and running the shop falls to Annie Mary.  Eventually she realizes that she has the upper hand now, and with a new sense of freedom she paints the kitchen a ghastly color and decides to join a local female pop group for a talent contest in Cardiff where there is a prize of 1000 pounds.  Is this a chance for redemption, a recipe for disaster, or both?  More importantly, will this be the point when Bethan (and the audience) finally get to hear Annie Mary sing?  Certainly she can do better than the weak Freddie Mercury imitation she attempts.  Then there is the question of the house that Annie Mary waves at when she walks by it.Annie Mary is an odd duck, but then most of the people in town are strange.  While this is entertaining, it really does not set up the big ending as well as it might if this was less of a comic-tragedy and more of an outright tragic tale.  After all, her father's actions towards her are truly despicable, and as a general rule I am not inclined to find that sort of abuse comic.  The low point that Annie Mary reaches makes her not only a sad figure, but rather pathetic, and some viewers may find that their reservoir of sympathy towards her has run out.  Certainly her few friends in town reach that point.  But such doubts about her character do not deter from the gloriously transcendent moment that Annie Mary achieves thanks to her one true friend.  Whatever problems there might be with the set up of the big moment, Sugarman and Griffith both deliver on that score.",4,"The set up gets a bit quirky, but the payoff for this one is transcendent",1125532800,"09 1, 2005",2005,3554,"['read', 'where', 'John', 'Irving', 'said', 'recently', 'always', 'end', 'story', 'first', 'have', 'feeling', 'writer-director', 'Sara', 'Sugarman', 'did', 'something', 'lines', 'Very', 'Annie', 'Mary', 'great', 'ending', 'one', 'least', 'great', 'climax', 'how', 'much', 'will', 'think', 'denouement', 'debatable', 'know', 'part', 'being', 'emotional', 'edge', 'week', 'watching', 'news', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Gulf', 'Coast', 'really', 'think', 'Sugarman', 'transcendent', 'ending', 'story', 'Annie', 'Mary', 'Pugh', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'who', 'town', 'Wales', 'why', 'everybody', 'Welsh', 'accent', 'not', 'can', 'imitate', 'such', 'way', 'do', 'English', 'Irish', 'Scotch', 'accent', 'ever', 'notice', 'Shakespeare', 'Henry', 'V', 'comic', 'relief', 'provided', 'four', 'men', 'Englishman', 'Irishman', 'Scott', 'Welshman', 'so', 'are', 'four', 'different', 'accents', 'play', 'conversations', '.Annie', 'Mary', 'father', 'Jack', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'local', 'bakery', 'not', 'only', 'sing', 'Pavarotti', 'speaker', 'system', 'truck', 'deliveries', 'great', 'tenor', 'including', 'mask', 'Annie', 'Mary', 'used', 'sing', 'too', 'even', 'won', 'contest', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'earned', 'chance', 'study', 'Milan', 'then', 'mother', 'died', 'Annie', 'Mary', 'not', 'sung', 'reasons', 'only', 'become', 'clear', 'think', 'end', 'father', 'abominably', 'birthday', 'cabbage', 'when', 'cold', 'curl', 'feet', 'Annie', 'Mary', 'luck', 'boys', 'town', 'even', 'pay', 'one', 'kiss', 'best', 'friend', 'Bethan', 'Bevan', 'Joanna', 'Page', 'bedridden', '16-year-old', 'who', 'quite', 'ill', 'only', 'Bethan', 'Annie', 'Mary', 'can', 'watch', 'silent', 'videotape', 'mother', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'were', 'happy', 'Meanwhile', 'mayor', 'raise', 'money', 'send', 'Bethan', 'Disneyland', 'Annie', 'Mary', 'would', 'like', 'help.Then', 'father', 'stroke', 'responsibility', 'taking', 'care', 'running', 'shop', 'Annie', 'Mary', 'Eventually', 'upper', 'hand', 'now', 'new', 'sense', 'freedom', 'kitchen', 'ghastly', 'color', 'decides', 'join', 'local', 'female', 'pop', 'group', 'talent', 'contest', 'Cardiff', 'where', 'prize', '1000', 'pounds', 'chance', 'redemption', 'recipe', 'disaster', 'More', 'importantly', 'will', 'be', 'point', 'when', 'Bethan', 'audience', 'finally', 'get', 'hear', 'Annie', 'Mary', 'sing', 'Certainly', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'weak', 'Freddie', 'Mercury', 'imitation', 'Then', 'question', 'house', 'Annie', 'Mary', 'waves', 'when', 'it.Annie', 'Mary', 'odd', 'duck', 'then', 'most', 'people', 'town', 'are', 'strange', 'entertaining', 'really', 'not', 'set', 'up', 'big', 'ending', 'as', 'well', 'might', 'was', 'less', 'comic-tragedy', 'more', 'outright', 'tragic', 'tale', 'father', 'actions', 'are', 'truly', 'despicable', 'general', 'rule', 'am', 'not', 'inclined', 'find', 'sort', 'abuse', 'comic', 'low', 'point', 'Annie', 'Mary', 'not', 'only', 'sad', 'figure', 'rather', 'pathetic', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'reservoir', 'sympathy', 'towards', 'run', 'out', 'Certainly', 'few', 'friends', 'town', 'reach', 'point', 'such', 'doubts', 'character', 'do', 'not', 'deter', 'gloriously', 'transcendent', 'moment', 'Annie', 'Mary', 'thanks', 'one', 'true', 'friend', 'problems', 'might', 'be', 'set', 'big', 'moment', 'Sugarman', 'Griffith', 'deliver', 'score']",Very Annie Mary

576980,A1H5KCR76NTSZT,B00005AFO3,"Milo ""gjm""","[15, 17]","This was a blast of nostalgia for me since I spent many childhood vacations in a Welsh coal mining valley. The Welsh are an underated nation. Their coarse and pithy humor rides on lilting voices that are interspersed with fat vowels and accentuated syllables. Their hearts are pure gold, hence one of the main plots of the story, a village pulls together to raise money to send a sick little girl on a trip to Disneyland. Unfortunately, the idea seems more a Holy Grail in their own minds, since little Bethan really has no desire to spend her last days in the arms of Mickey Mouse. The concurrent plot, is the conflict between Annie Mary and her dad. He is a dour and overbearing village baker who makes her life a misery, until he has a stroke and becomes a sad and helpless doll to be carelessly carted around by Annie. I should add at this point that I was amazed at Rachel Griffiths' command of the Welsh dialect. I didn't believe it was her until I checked the credits. Super eccentric performance with a believable accent... very impressive. The rest of the movie is one of those lovely quirky low key ramblings, full of odd characters and bizarre situations. If you know Wales, you will know the characters and will smile with affection. Not an oscar winner, but a sweet little view of a working class community in a beautiful land. Treat your jaded palate to something simple.",3,Need to know South Wales to fully appreciate....,1077148800,"02 19, 2004",2004,1385,"['was', 'blast', 'nostalgia', 'spent', 'many', 'childhood', 'vacations', 'Welsh', 'coal', 'mining', 'valley', 'Welsh', 'are', 'underated', 'nation', 'coarse', 'pithy', 'humor', 'rides', 'lilting', 'voices', 'are', 'interspersed', 'fat', 'vowels', 'accentuated', 'syllables', 'hearts', 'are', 'pure', 'gold', 'hence', 'one', 'main', 'plots', 'story', 'village', 'together', 'raise', 'money', 'send', 'sick', 'little', 'girl', 'trip', 'Disneyland', 'Unfortunately', 'idea', 'more', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'own', 'minds', 'little', 'Bethan', 'really', 'desire', 'spend', 'last', 'days', 'arms', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'concurrent', 'plot', 'conflict', 'Annie', 'Mary', 'dad', 'dour', 'overbearing', 'village', 'baker', 'who', 'life', 'misery', 'stroke', 'sad', 'helpless', 'doll', 'be', 'carelessly', 'carted', 'Annie', 'should', 'add', 'point', 'was', 'amazed', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'command', 'Welsh', 'dialect', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'checked', 'credits', 'Super', 'eccentric', 'performance', 'believable', 'accent', 'very', 'impressive', 'rest', 'movie', 'one', 'lovely', 'quirky', 'low', 'key', 'ramblings', 'full', 'odd', 'characters', 'bizarre', 'situations', 'know', 'Wales', 'will', 'know', 'characters', 'will', 'smile', 'affection', 'Not', 'oscar', 'winner', 'sweet', 'little', 'view', 'working', 'class', 'community', 'beautiful', 'land', 'Treat', 'jaded', 'palate', 'something', 'simple']",Very Annie Mary
