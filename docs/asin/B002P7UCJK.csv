1282555,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B002P7UCJK,Amit Talpade,"[1, 1]","Three things are evident after watching this movie. First Park Chan - Wook( Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Old Boy, Lady Vengeance) is one of the finest directors that we have now. Secondly, Asian cinemas has made the best horror films in the last decade and finally watch this movie before it is butchered by Hollywood.This movie is loosely based on the book 'Therese Raquin' by Emile ZolaFather Sang is a priest who cares for his religion and will do whatever it takes to save humanity. The EV, Emmannuel Virus has started to kill people by slowly covering their bodies with painful blisters which ultimately destroy the internal organs and can also make people vomit blood. As a part of an experiment, Father Sang volunteers to help out in finding a cure and agrees to receive the virus in hopes of finding a cure. However the experiment fails and he contracts the illness but makes a speedy recovery with the help of a blood transfusion but he discovers that he has turned in to a vampire and can only sustain from blood taken from the body of his now comatose friend. With this transformation he notices that he is strangely attracted to his best friends Kang-Woo's wife, Tae-ju (Kim Ok-Vin), who reciprocates and they begin a torrid affair. She is repulsed when she discovers that he is a vampire but gradually relents. Father Sang pleads with her to run away with him but instead she hatches a plot to kill Kang Woo, whom she falsely accuses of abusing her. So they embark on a fishing trip and kill him. Things take a weirder turn in the second half because Tae Ju herself becomes a vampire but does not believe in obtaining easy blood but killing for it. The massacre of family friends at a Mah Jong gathering is very creepy with great music.I could go on and on about the story but you just have to watch it and see it for yourself the unfolding of this great tale. Song Kang- Ho is a great actor and plays the part of the conflicted priest and lover with conviction. His love and ultimate nemesis Kim Ok-Vin, plays the part of the shrewish, manipulative, immature and yet vulnerable wife and lover convincingly. They are supported by a host of great character actors and although there are attempts to throw in some humor involving Tae Ju ( Ok-Vin) mother in law but they are passable. Although advertised as a horror movie it is a great character study and directorial triumph for Park because it is no mean feat to make such a complex storyline compelling and giving it an ending that is sad yet deserving. It is no mean feat because the movie is in Korean and cultural nuances can sometimes get lost. The music is very creepy and lends a sensational tone to the movement on screen. I gave it five stars. 5/21/10",5,Vampire film with moral undertones...One of the best horror films,1274486400,"05 22, 2010",2010,2722,"['Three', 'things', 'are', 'evident', 'watching', 'movie', 'First', 'Park', 'Chan', 'Wook', 'Sympathy', 'Mr.', 'Vengeance', 'Old', 'Boy', 'Lady', 'Vengeance', 'one', 'finest', 'directors', 'have', 'now', 'Secondly', 'Asian', 'cinemas', 'made', 'best', 'horror', 'films', 'last', 'decade', 'finally', 'watch', 'movie', 'butchered', 'Hollywood.This', 'movie', 'loosely', 'based', 'book', ""'Therese"", 'Raquin', 'Emile', 'ZolaFather', 'Sang', 'priest', 'who', 'religion', 'will', 'do', 'whatever', 'save', 'humanity', 'EV', 'Emmannuel', 'Virus', 'started', 'kill', 'people', 'slowly', 'covering', 'bodies', 'painful', 'blisters', 'ultimately', 'destroy', 'internal', 'organs', 'can', 'also', 'make', 'people', 'vomit', 'blood', 'part', 'experiment', 'Father', 'Sang', 'volunteers', 'help', 'out', 'finding', 'cure', 'receive', 'virus', 'hopes', 'finding', 'cure', 'However', 'experiment', 'fails', 'contracts', 'illness', 'speedy', 'recovery', 'help', 'blood', 'transfusion', 'turned', 'vampire', 'can', 'only', 'sustain', 'blood', 'taken', 'body', 'now', 'comatose', 'friend', 'transformation', 'strangely', 'attracted', 'best', 'Kang-Woo', 'wife', 'Tae-ju', 'Kim', 'Ok-Vin', 'who', 'begin', 'torrid', 'affair', 'repulsed', 'when', 'vampire', 'gradually', 'relents', 'Father', 'Sang', 'run', 'away', 'instead', 'plot', 'kill', 'Kang', 'Woo', 'whom', 'falsely', 'abusing', 'embark', 'fishing', 'trip', 'kill', 'Things', 'take', 'weirder', 'turn', 'second', 'half', 'Tae', 'Ju', 'vampire', 'not', 'believe', 'obtaining', 'easy', 'blood', 'killing', 'massacre', 'family', 'friends', 'Mah', 'Jong', 'gathering', 'very', 'creepy', 'great', 'music.I', 'could', 'go', 'story', 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'unfolding', 'great', 'tale', 'Song', 'Kang-', 'Ho', 'great', 'actor', 'part', 'conflicted', 'priest', 'lover', 'conviction', 'love', 'ultimate', 'nemesis', 'Kim', 'Ok-Vin', 'part', 'shrewish', 'manipulative', 'immature', 'yet', 'vulnerable', 'wife', 'lover', 'convincingly', 'are', 'supported', 'host', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'are', 'attempts', 'throw', 'humor', 'involving', 'Tae', 'Ju', 'Ok-Vin', 'mother', 'law', 'are', 'passable', 'advertised', 'horror', 'movie', 'great', 'character', 'study', 'directorial', 'triumph', 'Park', 'mean', 'feat', 'make', 'such', 'complex', 'storyline', 'compelling', 'giving', 'ending', 'sad', 'yet', 'deserving', 'mean', 'feat', 'movie', 'Korean', 'cultural', 'nuances', 'can', 'sometimes', 'get', 'lost', 'music', 'very', 'creepy', 'sensational', 'tone', 'movement', 'screen', 'gave', 'five', 'stars', '5/21/10']",N/A

1282557,A38VUL968CH4S1,B002P7UCJK,Austen True,"[1, 2]","I appreciate a good Chan-Wook Park film. I loved his Vengeance trilogy and proclaim to be a fan of his work, even his short film ""Cut"" in '3 Extremes' was amazing. However, I do not admit to liking this movie very much. There is a style in its CGI that I confess to being impressive. Instead of watching a film like 'Transformers' where you are constantly unsurprised by its over-compensation of SFX talent, you are fascinated by ""Thirst""'s mysterious working of simple yet mystifying tricks. You know there has to be some wire-work in some scenes of this film, though there are some parts where, like trying to guess the secret behind a magic trick, you are left dumbfounded as to how they pulled that off without an over-elaborate tooling with a computer. The intriguing characterization, powerful performances, and magician-like special effects isn't enough for me to like this movie. I don't shy away from erotic movies; so understand this was not the part of the film that bothered me. I suppose I'm biased in not appreciating the protagonist's dramatic conflicts, but it just can't be helped. I appreciate his character's development, however I wish to argue that he should have made more changes when they were necessary. The heroine's character is just heartbreaking to review, because she is, like many males encounter in life, just--pardon my crude opinion but--a silly, tragic yet harebrained, bloodthirsty nympho that just seems more like a child than a sympathetic character. One can tell that the director tries to, once again, present his beliefs in ""Vengeance Is Never The Answer,"" though I feel it burns the movie's integrity altogether ruining a masterpiece that could have been legendary. This was an artistically inspiring take on the vampire trend nowadays, and was original in its own tackling of the over-popular franchise. But in the end I felt truly sad, even though I never shy away from compelling tragedies, but I tragically cannot admit to feeling satisfied with this Chan-Wook Park film. I hope he returns to his jaw-dropping talent and makes a comeback. So in a nutshell: SFX, decent character development, and originality makes this interesting...but altogether not enough to champion its downfall.",3,"Interesting vampire idea, however...",1282867200,"08 27, 2010",2010,2230,"['appreciate', 'good', 'Chan-Wook', 'Park', 'film', 'loved', 'Vengeance', 'trilogy', 'proclaim', 'be', 'fan', 'work', 'even', 'short', 'film', 'Cut', '3', 'Extremes', 'was', 'amazing', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'admit', 'liking', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'style', 'CGI', 'confess', 'being', 'impressive', 'Instead', 'watching', 'film', ""'Transformers"", 'where', 'are', 'constantly', 'unsurprised', 'over-compensation', 'SFX', 'talent', 'are', 'fascinated', 'Thirst', 'mysterious', 'working', 'simple', 'yet', 'mystifying', 'tricks', 'know', 'there', 'be', 'wire-work', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'parts', 'where', 'trying', 'guess', 'secret', 'magic', 'trick', 'are', 'left', 'dumbfounded', 'how', 'pulled', 'off', 'over-elaborate', 'tooling', 'computer', 'intriguing', 'characterization', 'powerful', 'performances', 'magician-like', 'special', 'effects', ""n't"", 'enough', 'like', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'erotic', 'movies', 'so', 'was', 'not', 'part', 'film', 'bothered', 'suppose', ""'m"", 'biased', 'not', 'appreciating', 'protagonist', 'dramatic', 'conflicts', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'helped', 'appreciate', 'character', 'development', 'however', 'wish', 'argue', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'changes', 'when', 'were', 'necessary', 'heroine', 'character', 'just', 'heartbreaking', 'review', 'many', 'males', 'encounter', 'life', 'just', 'pardon', 'crude', 'opinion', 'silly', 'tragic', 'yet', 'harebrained', 'bloodthirsty', 'nympho', 'just', 'more', 'child', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'One', 'can', 'tell', 'director', 'once', 'again', 'present', 'beliefs', 'Vengeance', 'Never', 'Answer', 'feel', 'movie', 'integrity', 'altogether', 'ruining', 'masterpiece', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'legendary', 'was', 'artistically', 'inspiring', 'take', 'vampire', 'trend', 'nowadays', 'was', 'original', 'own', 'tackling', 'over-popular', 'franchise', 'end', 'felt', 'truly', 'sad', 'even', 'never', 'shy', 'away', 'compelling', 'tragedies', 'tragically', 'can', 'not', 'admit', 'feeling', 'satisfied', 'Chan-Wook', 'Park', 'film', 'hope', 'jaw-dropping', 'talent', 'comeback', 'So', 'nutshell', 'SFX', 'decent', 'character', 'development', 'originality', 'interesting', 'altogether', 'not', 'enough', 'champion', 'downfall']",N/A

When he becomes infected, an unidentifiable blood transfusion brings him back to life, only now he has become a vampire. Torn between his faith and the sins of the flesh, Sang-hyun begins an affair with Tae-ju; a friend's wife. Now he must fight temptation and the murderous desire for blood that vampirism has given him.Is it any good?Erotic, perverted, daring, stylistic with plenty of blood; these are the things that we've come to expect from a Park Chan-Wook film and `Thirst' delivers them all. Park's exceptional creative direction is backed with top-notch acting from the film's leads Song Kang-ho and Kim Ok-bin, their love affair is both macabre and sensual with comedic charm. Song Kang-ho is a Priest struck with vampirism whose pain in temptation from guilty pleasures resonates brilliantly with Kim Ok-bin's already sinful `Tae-ju'. My only problem with `Thirst' is that at over 2 hours long it can feel a little drawn out at times, I also found the apparition scenes with the murdered husband a bit confusing; was he a ghost or a guilty hallucination? Or, maybe I just missed something? Needless to say `Thirst' deserves a view or two, it is a thought-provoking vampire love story and a must see for Park Chan-Wook fans; `Twilight' for grown-ups.Best bit?While infected Priest Sang-hyun is playing his flute, he chokes as blood flows out of his mouth and through the holes in the flute; Park Chan-Wook never fails to surprise!Did you know?There are talks of an American re-make...why?",3,"Erotic, perverted, daring, stylistic and with plenty of blood",1336262400,"05 6, 2012",2012,1616,"['What', 'devout', 'priest', 'named', 'Sang-hyun', 'volunteers', 'medical', 'experiment', 'help', 'save', 'lives', 'virus', 'When', 'becomes', 'infected', 'unidentifiable', 'blood', 'transfusion', 'back', 'life', 'only', 'now', 'become', 'vampire', 'Torn', 'faith', 'sins', 'flesh', 'Sang-hyun', 'affair', 'Tae-ju', 'friend', 'wife', 'Now', 'must', 'fight', 'temptation', 'murderous', 'desire', 'blood', 'vampirism', 'given', 'him.Is', 'good', 'Erotic', 'perverted', 'daring', 'stylistic', 'plenty', 'blood', 'are', 'things', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Park', 'Chan-Wook', 'film', 'Thirst', 'delivers', 'Park', 'exceptional', 'creative', 'direction', 'backed', 'top-notch', 'acting', 'film', 'leads', 'Song', 'Kang-ho', 'Kim', 'Ok-bin', 'love', 'affair', 'macabre', 'sensual', 'comedic', 'charm', 'Song', 'Kang-ho', 'Priest', 'struck', 'vampirism', 'pain', 'temptation', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'brilliantly', 'Kim', 'Ok-bin', 'already', 'sinful', 'Tae-ju', 'only', 'problem', 'Thirst', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'can', 'feel', 'little', 'drawn', 'out', 'times', 'also', 'found', 'apparition', 'scenes', 'murdered', 'husband', 'bit', 'confusing', 'was', 'ghost', 'guilty', 'hallucination', 'maybe', 'just', 'missed', 'something', 'Needless', 'say', 'Thirst', 'view', 'two', 'thought-provoking', 'vampire', 'love', 'story', 'must', 'see', 'Park', 'Chan-Wook', 'fans', 'Twilight', 'grown-ups.Best', 'bit', 'infected', 'Priest', 'Sang-hyun', 'playing', 'flute', 'blood', 'mouth', 'holes', 'flute', 'Park', 'Chan-Wook', 'never', 'surprise', 'Did', 'know', 'are', 'talks', 'American', 're-make', 'why']",N/A

More than almost any other living Korean film-maker, Park solidified his well-earned reputation with the sleeper hit Oldboy. Although I've enjoyed & certainly respected his decisions when it comes to other works, I couldn't fathom anything so masterful nor as mature. Thirst actually exceeded every last one of my expectations & easily became my favorite film of 2009.Thankfully, we were granted a North American release for Bakjwi although the 145 min Director's Cut is a bit more obscure & harder to find. At any rate, I am grateful to have seen the film at all & am completely excited about Park's future endeavors once again. Park has earned his weight in gold as far as I'm concerned.Taking it's cue from the classic Emile Zola novel Therese Raquin, Wook has crafted a masterful film that begs to be seen and dissected.After witnessing the deaths of so many around him, Priest Sang-hyeon decided to undergo a medical procedure which could prove to be extremely fatal. However, Sang-hyun is convinced that his Lord will watch over him & he's determined to go through with the experiment irregardless of how risky the treatment may be.As fate would have it, Sang-hyun does survive by means of infected blood which turns him into a vampire. Now he must drink the fluid of life for sustenance as well as battle his new found carnal desires. It's not an easy task to obtain blood but Sang-hyun embraces the challenge & finds himself battling the seven deadly sins.Although it's hard to decide whether Park intends for his film to be a very morbid comedy with splashes of drama, Thirst is compulsively watchable & you'll find yourself irrevocably glued to the screen from the opening scene until the tragic ending. If you love Chan-wook Park, you know pretty much what to expect. His films are often tragic, twisted, & yet darkly comical. Thirst makes good use of Park's skills to weave a great tale and keep you begging for literally more.Much like Oldboy, it's not always evident where Thirst will take you but you can be sure it's going to be a wild ride worth taking. The story is incredibly rich, the characters are brilliant, & the Korean vampire twist seems quite authentic making Thirst the most unique film experience in the most extreme sense of the word. Also like Oldboy, Thirst is a very dark if not strange love story with many turns & twists. However, I suggest you stick with it as the film does promise quite a bit & successfully delivers each one of it's promises.

Sang-hyeong is the only patient out of 500 volunteers that survives, but once released, the symptoms of the Emmanuelle Virus continue to set in... That is, unless he consumes human blood to disarm the blistering effects of the disease.

While there, he falls deeply in love with the man's wife, and must battle with his own convictions and his new blood lust in order to maintain his humanity.Acclaimed director Park Chan-wook visits the realm of the supernatural in this hauntingly beautiful re-imagining of the classic vampire mythos. THIRST takes the subtle effectiveness of 2008's LET THE RIGHT ONE IN and introduces both a heightened sexuality and increased bloodshed. Park gracefully allows the camera to glide over every scene, with a fluid and organic camera style that is carried over from his VENGEANCE trilogy. The tragic tale of the reluctant vampire is taken to a entirely new level when a priest is stricken with the affliction, causing him to call into question his deep-rooted faith and defend his evil actions. Korean nationals Kang-ho Song and Ok-bin Kim are mesmerizing in their respective roles, creating a perfect dichotomy in their opposing actions and beliefs. The poetic lyricism of the script is only matched by the incredible visual storytelling used in painting the picture as a modern Gothic masterpiece.Few filmmakers have taken such a daring chance in manipulating the standard conventions of the genre, but with THIRST Park Chan-wook has succeeded in twisting the vampire legend into a unique and artistic personal vision.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",5,Thirst,1286064000,"10 3, 2010",2010,1883,"['Father', 'Sang-hyeong', 'pilgrimage', 'Africa', 'participate', 'experimental', 'study', 'would', 'help', 'save', 'lives', 'hundreds', 'people', 'were', 'successful', 'Sang-hyeong', 'only', 'patient', '500', 'volunteers', 'once', 'released', 'symptoms', 'Emmanuelle', 'Virus', 'continue', 'set', 'human', 'blood', 'disarm', 'blistering', 'effects', 'disease', 'return', 'Korea', 'praised', 'martyr', 'brought', 'home', 'childhood', 'friend', 'pray', 'cure', 'cancer', 'there', 'deeply', 'love', 'man', 'wife', 'must', 'battle', 'own', 'convictions', 'new', 'blood', 'lust', 'order', 'maintain', 'humanity.Acclaimed', 'director', 'Park', 'Chan-wook', 'realm', 'supernatural', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 're-imagining', 'classic', 'vampire', 'mythos', 'THIRST', 'subtle', 'effectiveness', '2008', 'LET', 'THE', 'RIGHT', 'ONE', 'IN', 'introduces', 'heightened', 'sexuality', 'increased', 'bloodshed', 'Park', 'gracefully', 'camera', 'glide', 'scene', 'fluid', 'organic', 'camera', 'style', 'carried', 'VENGEANCE', 'trilogy', 'tragic', 'tale', 'reluctant', 'vampire', 'taken', 'entirely', 'new', 'level', 'when', 'priest', 'stricken', 'affliction', 'causing', 'call', 'question', 'deep-rooted', 'faith', 'defend', 'evil', 'actions', 'Korean', 'nationals', 'Kang-ho', 'Song', 'Ok-bin', 'Kim', 'are', 'mesmerizing', 'respective', 'roles', 'creating', 'perfect', 'dichotomy', 'opposing', 'actions', 'beliefs', 'poetic', 'lyricism', 'script', 'only', 'matched', 'incredible', 'visual', 'storytelling', 'used', 'painting', 'picture', 'modern', 'Gothic', 'masterpiece.Few', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'taken', 'daring', 'chance', 'manipulating', 'standard', 'conventions', 'genre', 'THIRST', 'Park', 'Chan-wook', 'succeeded', 'twisting', 'vampire', 'legend', 'unique', 'artistic', 'personal', 'vision.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

The romantic relationships he builds in his films are absolutely compelling, and this one is no exception.

Saying that I don't have to say that if a certain vampire series is a romance for girls, Chan Wook's film is a vampiric romance story for psychopaths. Truthfully I found it lacking a small bit but the directors visual style, the actors, and the general story definitely make the film worth seeing, be it for fans of the director or horror film afficianados.The film does have an intriguing setup. Priest Sang Hyeon feeling sort of useless watching people slip into comas and die at a hospital volunteers for disease research in Africa. Close to death and bleeding out, the doctors trying to save him infuse him with tainted blood that just happens to be from a vampire. When He returns to Korea the priest has his own cult of cripples hoping to be cured by the resurrected priest. The head monk of the hospital hopes to drink his vampire blood as Sang Hyeon confesses his affliction, to cure his blindness. And after befriending cancer victim Kang Woo and his obnoxious mother, He finds himself falling for the put upon Tae Joo. What happens there is the experience as only Chan Wook Park can create with dark humor, and a vicious streak especially after Sang Hyeon relents and turns Tae Joo into a vampire.I said one of the things Chan Wook does well is create a top notch visual experience. The effect is scaled back from Sympathy for Lady Vengeance which was all over the place in terms of direction. Here though there are some exceptional moments like Sang Hyeon leaping off a huge building with Tae (shot the top down on Tae Joo's face as the ground changes behind her face as He leaps). There are also small visual moments like Sang Hyeon seeing Tae Joo's circulatory system. Like I said though the experience is much more scaled back but seemingly alive for the director.What works though is the story, especially in the story of the afflicted priest who's fighting his urges of vampirism by feeding off the blood of coma patients. Theres a lot of details in the movie, like the cult or Tae Joo throwing herself in front of cars on the freeway to feed on the drivers after they stop to check on her. The movie is good with its story of conflict ending on the perfect note I won't describe. I will say that I found it in some way beautiful, funny, and horrific all at the same time.Theres only one caveat I have with the movie. In the middle of the film theres a bit of misplaced humor with a characters ghost coming back to haunt Sang Hyeon and Tae Joo. I can understand the idea but in the end its rather pointless made worse mined for comedic effect. Scenes like Sang Hyeok throwing himself out a window and destroying a car in the process, or destroying a light pole in a fit of rage. But the appariton was too much for too little in terms of purpose. In the end thats a small probelm with an otherwise great movie.What isn't great though is the DVD. I've heard complaints about the picture and sound which I found to be good but lacking considering what makes the film work is the style achieved through the directors vision. Its like the distributors didn't even try made worse by the fact that for a full retail disc theres absolutely nothing in terms of added content. I'm not one who worries too much about special features, but a barebones disc that seems barely put together by the studio is a bit of a shame.Still don't let that stop you from seeing the movie.",4,Thirst,1258761600,"11 21, 2009",2009,3470,"['only', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'Chan', 'Wook', 'Park', 'Thirst', 'Chan', 'Wook', 'Park', 'film', 'Saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'say', 'certain', 'vampire', 'series', 'romance', 'girls', 'Chan', 'Wook', 'film', 'vampiric', 'romance', 'story', 'psychopaths', 'Truthfully', 'found', 'lacking', 'small', 'bit', 'directors', 'visual', 'style', 'actors', 'general', 'story', 'definitely', 'make', 'film', 'seeing', 'be', 'fans', 'director', 'horror', 'film', 'afficianados.The', 'film', 'have', 'intriguing', 'setup', 'Priest', 'Sang', 'Hyeon', 'feeling', 'sort', 'useless', 'watching', 'people', 'slip', 'comas', 'die', 'hospital', 'volunteers', 'disease', 'research', 'Africa', 'Close', 'death', 'bleeding', 'out', 'doctors', 'trying', 'save', 'infuse', 'tainted', 'blood', 'just', 'be', 'vampire', 'When', 'Korea', 'priest', 'own', 'cult', 'cripples', 'hoping', 'be', 'cured', 'resurrected', 'priest', 'head', 'monk', 'hospital', 'drink', 'vampire', 'blood', 'Sang', 'Hyeon', 'affliction', 'cure', 'blindness', 'befriending', 'cancer', 'victim', 'Kang', 'Woo', 'obnoxious', 'mother', 'falling', 'put', 'Tae', 'Joo', 'What', 'experience', 'only', 'Chan', 'Wook', 'Park', 'can', 'create', 'dark', 'humor', 'vicious', 'streak', 'especially', 'Sang', 'Hyeon', 'relents', 'Tae', 'Joo', 'vampire.I', 'said', 'one', 'things', 'Chan', 'Wook', 'well', 'create', 'top', 'notch', 'visual', 'experience', 'effect', 'scaled', 'back', 'Sympathy', 'Lady', 'Vengeance', 'was', 'place', 'terms', 'direction', 'Here', 'are', 'exceptional', 'moments', 'Sang', 'Hyeon', 'leaping', 'off', 'huge', 'building', 'Tae', 'shot', 'top', 'down', 'Tae', 'Joo', 'face', 'ground', 'changes', 'face', 'are', 'also', 'small', 'visual', 'moments', 'Sang', 'Hyeon', 'seeing', 'Tae', 'Joo', 'circulatory', 'system', 'said', 'experience', 'much', 'more', 'scaled', 'back', 'seemingly', 'alive', 'director.What', 'story', 'especially', 'story', 'afflicted', 'priest', 'who', 'fighting', 'urges', 'vampirism', 'feeding', 'off', 'blood', 'coma', 'patients', 'lot', 'details', 'movie', 'cult', 'Tae', 'Joo', 'throwing', 'front', 'cars', 'freeway', 'feed', 'drivers', 'stop', 'check', 'movie', 'good', 'story', 'conflict', 'ending', 'perfect', 'note', 'wo', ""n't"", 'describe', 'will', 'say', 'found', 'way', 'beautiful', 'funny', 'horrific', 'same', 'only', 'one', 'caveat', 'have', 'movie', 'middle', 'film', 'bit', 'misplaced', 'humor', 'characters', 'ghost', 'coming', 'back', 'haunt', 'Sang', 'Hyeon', 'Tae', 'Joo', 'can', 'understand', 'idea', 'end', 'rather', 'pointless', 'made', 'worse', 'mined', 'comedic', 'effect', 'Scenes', 'Sang', 'Hyeok', 'throwing', 'window', 'destroying', 'car', 'process', 'destroying', 'light', 'pole', 'fit', 'rage', 'appariton', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'little', 'terms', 'purpose', 'end', 'small', 'probelm', 'otherwise', 'great', 'movie.What', ""n't"", 'great', 'though', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'complaints', 'picture', 'sound', 'found', 'be', 'good', 'lacking', 'considering', 'what', 'film', 'work', 'style', 'achieved', 'directors', 'vision', 'distributors', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'made', 'worse', 'fact', 'full', 'retail', 'disc', 'theres', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'terms', 'added', 'content', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'who', 'too', 'much', 'special', 'features', 'barebones', 'disc', 'barely', 'put', 'together', 'studio', 'bit', 'shame.Still', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'seeing', 'movie']",N/A

1282567,AWH5ZZ8UXY1QJ,B002P7UCJK,Decoratin4Fun!,"[0, 0]","Thirst starts with an intriguing premise: a Priest who accidentally becomes a vampire after an anonymous blood transfusion.  While struggling with questions of being a half-demon and a leader of Catholic doctrines, he falls for a Cinderella like figure---a woman living as a virtual housekeeper to her husband and mother in law, with calloused bare feet and raggy old clothing to boot.Similar to, Let the Right One In, the woman is a disabused oddball, desperate for escape.  But unlike that film, the vampire savior is himself much more naive.  In this relationship the human is more the manipulator (because she is a woman), and as a result reads like a sympathetic femme fatale.  Unfortunately this can result in some problematic and sanctimonious moments in the film where the Priest is always the hero, and she is sort of a wrathful harpy.Those characterisations aside, Chan limits the film by focusing so much on a toxic love story.  Especially because the runtime is so long (two and a half hours), you're often wondering why this woman's particular family is so important.  Between the set up, and the final act in the film (which we can see coming), there is about an hour of screen time that is mainly concerned with plot machinations.The film has some fantastic scenes that stand out on their own in the horror genre, especially towards the end.  Chan's cinematography is beautifully dark and sensual.  There are wonderful, understated special effects demonstrating vampiric super strength.

It's got strong sex scenes with a dose of bloody violence and good performances, the film has an artsy feel to it that just makes it seem different yet stylish as i recommend this movie to vampire fanatics or Asian cinema lovers.This DVD contains the film in it's Korean language version with subtitles but it's got zero extras at all.Also recommended: ""Let The Right One In"", ""Daybreakers"", ""Rabid"", ""The Hunger"", ""Vampires (John Carpenter)"", ""Lifeforce"", ""Vamp"", ""Fright Night 1 & 2"", ""Dracula (1931)"", ""Nosferatu (1922 and 1979)"", ""Near Dark"", ""Twilight Saga"", ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer (1992 movie with show)"", ""Razor Blade Smile"", Hammer Dracula movies, ""Vampire Lovers"", ""The Lost Boys"", ""Once Bitten"", ""Blood The Last Vampire (Both versions)"", ""Vampire's Kiss"", ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"", ""Vampire Hunter D 1 & 2"", ""Interview with the Vampire"", ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", ""Def By Temptation"", ""Vampire Circus"", ""Vampyres"", ""Bordello of Blood"", ""Vampire Journals"", ""Modern Vampires"", ""Embrace of the Vampire"", ""The Habbit"", ""Immortality (a.k.a.

It seems like in film everyone wants a cut of that dark prince money and Thirst is Chan-Wook Park's time to take a bite bleed him some.Thirst is not a new take on the genre: a generally good person is unconsciously forced to live the lifestyle and surviving by the morally unsound practices of being everyone's favorite species of hellspawn, and while battling with his human nature also inducts yet another generally good person down the same dark direction.  The director, Chan-Wook Park, doesn't really disturb us as effectively as he did in Old Boy (which is a good thing, or else he would put himself in a 'Shock director' category that's dominated by Takashi Miike and would be most likely looked down upon)but instead he gives us a very interesting offering that seems more reminiscent of the movie Bug with Ashley Judd from the female's perspective where a generally good woman meets with an interesting new man with a serious problem and she is brought to his level where he could handle but she gets lost and goes awry...replace the foiled room in Bug with the white paint of Thirst and there you have it!With the main character being a pious servant of God in his human life is in fact different, the execution isn't exactly spot on.  The actor who played Father Hyun, Song Kang-Ho, is an actor who, in movies I've seen him in, plays characters who's able to roll with the gut punches of life.  He doesn't really struggle with the morality, he merely leaves the cloth and accepts what he's become and survives as he must through ways that doesn't hurt people, and the fact that he is more aggressively self destructive when getting sweet nookie versus being a demon is inconsistent especially when he is in love with the young woman in quesion and both choose to live together which is in accordance with his faith and doesn't require him whipping his thighs (but then again he could be a self-masochist but ummm...lets not delve any deeper than we need).Thirst does have it's wicked fun and this is where the director really shines for the movie, in fact I feel as if he was just really bored at the first 1/3 of the movie and decided to say screw it I'll do it in the way that I'm comfortable and gives us a real treat the rest of the way out.  The imagery is delicious: the blues, the whites, the deep reds constantly making love to each other, the bursts of violence, the intense interactions between the two main characters ranging from sexually provocative, aggression, humor, and ultimately sweetness is to be noted as the main selling point of this film! I soooooo wish that Chan-Wook Park could have used the mounting tension he used in the beginning of Old Boy in this first third of this film and I would have given it four stars! If Father Hyun had more of a struggle with his situation at the beginning I would have given it five!Enjoying this movie for me would have technically started 2/3 of the way in and I prefer that it be well thought out as an experience, in its entirety.",3,The film that the movie 'Bug' tried to be...,1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,3090,"['Vampires', 'have', 'taken', 'yet', 'again', 'attentions', 'movie', 'goers', 'buyers', 'seekers', 'film', 'everyone', 'cut', 'dark', 'prince', 'money', 'Thirst', 'Chan-Wook', 'Park', 'time', 'take', 'bite', 'bleed', 'some.Thirst', 'not', 'new', 'take', 'genre', 'generally', 'good', 'person', 'unconsciously', 'forced', 'live', 'lifestyle', 'surviving', 'morally', 'unsound', 'practices', 'being', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'species', 'hellspawn', 'battling', 'human', 'nature', 'also', 'yet', 'generally', 'good', 'person', 'same', 'dark', 'direction', 'director', 'Chan-Wook', 'Park', ""n't"", 'really', 'disturb', 'as', 'effectively', 'did', 'Old', 'Boy', 'good', 'thing', 'else', 'would', 'put', ""'Shock"", 'director', 'category', 'dominated', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'likely', 'looked', 'down', 'upon', 'instead', 'very', 'interesting', 'offering', 'more', 'reminiscent', 'movie', 'Bug', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'female', 'perspective', 'where', 'generally', 'good', 'woman', 'meets', 'interesting', 'new', 'man', 'serious', 'problem', 'brought', 'level', 'where', 'could', 'handle', 'lost', 'awry', 'replace', 'foiled', 'room', 'Bug', 'white', 'paint', 'Thirst', 'there', 'have', 'main', 'character', 'being', 'pious', 'servant', 'God', 'human', 'life', 'fact', 'different', 'execution', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'spot', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Father', 'Hyun', 'Song', 'Kang-Ho', 'actor', 'who', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plays', 'characters', 'who', 'able', 'roll', 'gut', 'punches', 'life', ""n't"", 'really', 'struggle', 'morality', 'merely', 'cloth', 'what', 'become', 'must', 'through', 'ways', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'people', 'fact', 'more', 'aggressively', 'self', 'destructive', 'when', 'getting', 'sweet', 'nookie', 'versus', 'being', 'demon', 'inconsistent', 'especially', 'when', 'love', 'young', 'woman', 'quesion', 'choose', 'live', 'together', 'accordance', 'faith', ""n't"", 'require', 'whipping', 'thighs', 'then', 'again', 'could', 'be', 'self-masochist', 'ummm', 'not', 'delve', 'deeper', 'need', '.Thirst', 'have', 'wicked', 'fun', 'where', 'director', 'really', 'movie', 'fact', 'feel', 'was', 'just', 'really', 'bored', 'first', '1/3', 'movie', 'decided', 'say', 'screw', ""'ll"", 'do', 'way', ""'m"", 'comfortable', 'real', 'treat', 'rest', 'way', 'imagery', 'delicious', 'blues', 'whites', 'deep', 'reds', 'constantly', 'making', 'love', 'other', 'bursts', 'violence', 'intense', 'interactions', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'ranging', 'sexually', 'provocative', 'aggression', 'humor', 'ultimately', 'sweetness', 'be', 'noted', 'main', 'selling', 'point', 'film', 'soooooo', 'wish', 'Chan-Wook', 'Park', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'mounting', 'tension', 'used', 'beginning', 'Old', 'Boy', 'first', 'third', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'four', 'stars', 'Father', 'Hyun', 'had', 'more', 'struggle', 'situation', 'beginning', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'five', 'Enjoying', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'technically', 'started', '2/3', 'way', 'prefer', 'be', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'experience', 'entirety']",N/A

He resists at first, but thirst has a way of overcoming both scruples and vows.  It's a story about faith and redemption, a deeply romantic and moving love story ... and a story about murder, mayhem and sex.  Park Chan-Wook (Oldboy,Lady Vengeance,I'm a Cyborg, but That's OK), won the Jury Prize at Cannes for this stylish and bloody reinvention of the vampire mythos.This is Park Chan-Wook at the top of his game, and to my mind the very best of an outstanding resume.  The acting is superb, with Korea's leading actor Kang-ho Song (The Host, andMemories of Murder) as the priest and Ok-Vin Kim as his lover and nemesis.  The imagery is powerful and provocative; the camera plunges, leaps and crawls and yet the camera's smooth but relentless tracking of its subject matter never interrupts the precise and stylized framings, and always works in the service of the story.  Constantly surprising for its unique approach to capturing what is on screen, the cinematography never feels like a gimmick, or like style for its own sake (a complaint one might raise about some of Park Chan-Wook's earlier works, however fascinating they are).  This is a film that will affect you - it is provocative, funny, frightening, and always fascinating.

It's superbly made and has great performances, especially Song Kang-ho as the tormented vampire priest. Despite it's long length (over 2 hours) I would also say its one of the director's more accessible films. It's pretty violent and sexually explicit but there's nothing as disturbing or potentially upsetting as the content in the Vengeance Trilogy, and the plot is pretty straightforward. It's not Park's best (that still goes to Oldboy) but's up there.It's a shame, then, that Universal seriously dropped the ball with this DVD. For one thing, they neglected to put it on Blu-ray, which is inexcusable. Nearly every film nowadays, even direct-to-video slasher sequels, get Blu-rays, and Universal couldn't give one to one of the most famous and critically acclaimed international directors out there?But even then, it's possible for a standard DVD to be a quality product. Even if it's not high def, you can still have a good transfer and a healthy amount of special features. But Universal couldn't even get that right. For one thing, there are no special features at all even though the international releases had plenty to use. Not even a solitary interview with the director. Nothing. The quality of the presentation is pretty shoddy as well; the transfer, is simply put, crap. It's inconsistent with poor detail and lousy contrast.Even more insultingly, they burned in the English subtitles. Universal was so cheap that they couldn't even give us the option of changing them. So if you're Spanish, you're going to have to deal with two sets of subtitles on your screen. Pretty much every foreign film DVD in the last decade has had the option of turning off or changing the subtitles.Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of alternatives. If you possess a region-free Blu-ray player, you can import Tartan's disc from Amazon.co.uk but that leaves out most customers. The best one can hope for at this point is that Universal decides to cash in on Park's success when his American debut 'Stoker' comes out and release a better edition, but I'm not holding my breath.The impression is that no one cared when producing this DVD, they just wanted to put out the cheapest version possible and get it out there.

I have picked up the film because it is advertised as a vampire movie. However, after watching it, I feel that is is Korean version of the famous novel by Emil Zola ""Therese Raquin"".Two people are living in a stifling conditions.  There is a priest who is also a vampire drinking blood of the dying patients is his own version of the compassion towards human race.  And then there is a young woman who is a wife (and a servant like figure) to her husband and mother in law.  Both people are tormented by their lives that are causing them lots of personal suffering.  Their pairing is almost inevitable since it is the only way for both of them to overcome their mysery.  What neither one expects is that their relationship develops in a very sensual and unusual one.  But sins they both commit to attain it make them cruel and regretful.

However, where in those films it felt like he was sharing a story... a journey, this one just felt like one big conceit to me. More self-serving and self-exorcizing than interesting. This is unfortunate, because, there are some wonderful set pieces in this which would've worked so much better if there'd been just a bit more of a clear STYLE. That might seem odd, since often I find his films to be examples of the brutal colliding with the placidly mundane. It just didn't work here. Perhaps it doesn't help that I honestly feel we need yet another vampire movie like we need holes in our necks. (I DO realize that Park had had the basic idea of this story in his head for quite a few years, but, it's the timing NOW I'm criticizing) Also, and this might sound nit-picky, but I found the wire work to be almost completely sub-par and distractingly awkward. Over and over, it yanked me out of any hold the narrative may have had on me. It was just silly. Unless you have the time to really make it look like the actor is pushing off the ground, arcing and falling; DON'T BOTHER. It's distracting. Mainly, though, I found myself wishing for more background to establish the protagonist as a person truly doing good for selfless reasons PRIOR to becoming &#34;vampirized&#34;. SO many films seem in such a hurry to get to the &#34;exciting drama&#34; they skip over giving the audience what's necessary to understand the character going INTO life-changing events. Here, we see him standing around in an apparent daze and dutifully going off to take part in the test program. WHY? So, I felt left with no clear idea of WHAT was challenged within him once he WAS driven to seek blood (and other pleasures). It was much clearer to me that the female lead was a self-centered, shallow, put-upon brat who of course acted out in the opposite direction once she found herself empowered. Oh, well, there were some CLASSIC, wonderful, quirky Park moments; the first time we see him feeding below a sick bed, the wordless argument near the end about seeking shelter from the sun, the audacious &#34;threesome&#34; with the ghost who just won't go away, and, my favorite- the sequence where he jumps up and down with her in his arms and she shrieks with sheer roller-coaster-type joy. Awesome stuff.

1282594,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B002P7UCJK,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[12, 18]","Winner of the Grand Jury Prize in the 2009 Cannes Film Festival and recipient of critical and box-office acclaim in Asia, I jumped at the chance to see Park Chan Wook's (Oldboy, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance) ""THIRST"". The film is a horror-satirical drama that explores the dark bestial side of humanity that is quite bizarre, even creepy on occasion, but never for one minute does the film relent in exploring the psyche that comes from alienation and loneliness, while becoming a slave of love and lust.Sang Hyun (Song Kang-Ho, The Host, Memories of Murder) is a Catholic priest who volunteers in a local hospital. He provides last rites when necessary as well emotional support to its patients. Father Hyun is well-respected but he secretly suffers from emotions that can be defined as doubt, as he witnesses the dark world around him. Yet, he cherishes life, so he volunteers to take part in an experiment to eradicate the lethal EV virus, which is a threat to every Caucasian and Asian male. Father Hyun becomes stricken with the deadly virus and a blood transfusion is ordered up for him to save his life; in turn he becomes the first survivor of the deadly virus and some folks begin to regard him as a saint. But soon after his new lease on life, Hyun finds out that the blood he had received is infected and he is now living as a vampire that only the consumption of human blood can stave off the virus.Father Hyun struggles with his new found carnal desire for blood, and now also, his faith is put to the test when a childhood friend's wife, Tae-Ju (sexy Kim Ok-Vin) comes to him to escape the life she knew all her life. Sang-Hyun is now overwhelmed with his desires of the flesh, as he plunges deep within the world of carnal and sensual desires that brings him in intimate terms with the Seven Deadly Sins...Park Chan-Wook is one clever director in creating a new take on the vampire lore that blends the elements of the Seven Deadly Sins; Gluttony, Sloth, Lust, Greed, Pride, Wrath and Envy. The vampirism as seen by Park's rendition does have similarities to the established myths about vampires; vulnerability to sunlight, superhuman strength and speed, with a strong need for human blood--curiously this vampire does not grow fangs. The need for human blood is necessary to stave off the virus that somewhat touches on the sin of Gluttony. Lust and Envy is represented through Father Hyun's desire for Kang-Woo's (Shin Ha-Kyun) wife. Pride is represented when Hyun allows himself to be seen as a ""Saint"" at first. Sloth when he gains lesions and when he has to live in a dirty basement. Greed for life as he becomes afraid of dying and hungry for companionship. Wrath as Hyun is led to murder and he is brought face to face with the consequences of his actions. Vampirism becomes seen as the ultimate root of evil in the eyes of Father Hyun, but in some ironic manner, it all frees him of his inhibitions.Song Kang-Ho is one VERY versatile actor. The man has played different roles throughout his career and he is clearly the right man for the role of Father Hyun. Hyun becomes a compelling character as we see him torn between the need to survive while avoiding the need to kill. ""God feeds even the birds in the sky"", so Hyun resorts to slowly drinking the blood for comatose patients in the hospital (but never killing them) and people who wish to commit suicide. He also tries to overcome his lustful thoughts by hitting his thighs to overcome an erection. Curiously, Hyun becomes more aware of himself when he became a vampire; he realizes exactly who he is as he finds himself leaving the Order. Tae-Ju is one imbalanced woman who is manipulative of any situation. She seduces the kindly priest and manipulates him into believing that she is an abused wife; she is a woman torn between her reliance on her husband and the need to be free (as symbolized by her constant running at night). The sex scenes between Kang-Ho and Ok-Vin are quite erotically creepy at times, and very graphic; comparable to some Japanese pink films.The film's takes up a darkly satirical tone that becomes weirder and darker as the film progresses, yet, it also becomes funnier, more bizarre and grittier. There is one very bizarre scene when Hyun and Tae-ju is having sex, with a vision of Tae-ju's dead husband sandwiched between them to bring the guilt of the murderous deed into exposition. While the first half of the film brings the weaknesses of the flesh with Hyun's character, the second half progresses in bringing its consequences. Hyun is overly obsessed with sexy Tae-ju as he would do whatever it takes to be with her, even though he is aware that she is somewhat imbalanced, she is all he has and he turns her; much to his regret later. While Hyun would avoid killing a human for his need, Tae-ju becomes drunk with power, as she doesn't mind killing at all. It is a testament to Park's skills as director as the plot revolves around his characters; that somewhat touches upon certain definitions of being a monster as well as how you wield certain abilities, with the definition of being human coming full circle in the screenplay. I loved the way Father Hyun began to atone for his sins one by one. He also gets rid of his ""Saintly"" image by letting himself be caught with a woman that led to him becoming scorned.It is hard for me to find flaws in the script, the metaphors and symbols are executed masterfully; even the supporting characters are significant vehicles in fleshing out the main protagonists. I suppose if one wanted to nit-pick, one may say that the paralysis of Tae-ju's mother-in-law (played by Kim Hae-Sook) felt a little forced to generate some humor. Also, it can be argued that Tae-ju's character isn't as well written as Father Hyun's. Still, these flaws are very minor as Park Chan-Wook successfully brings us to a world full of darkness and very GRIM humor with an atmosphere that resembles a fable and excellent cinematography to match. ""Thirst"" isn't a comedy, but it is funny in a way that is both creepy and gloomy at the same time. The film also has a good share of blood and some gore, and yes, quite a good number of nudity and sex. (It is also the first mainstream Korean film that features male full frontal nudity)""Thirst"" is ultimately a success. Park Chan Wook was able to come up with a beautiful film that is full of elegy, while exploring the flaws of the human mind, that treats vampirism as a cause for the realization of one's carnal desires in incorporating a Catholic overtone. I really loved the manner in which Park executed this original vampire film that BOLDLY dares to be different. It is not a horror film per se, but its horror elements come from the Fears of making the wrong decisions.Definitely lyrical, darkly satirical, often Ironic and so erotically sexy, yet, so engagingly beautiful with compelling characters, Park Chan Wook's ""Thirst"" is destined to attain a large cult following.Highly Recommended!
