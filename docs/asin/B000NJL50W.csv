Gardiner makes some curious observations about secret societies and mystics.  He discusses the historical journey of the Ark of the Covenant and reveals theories that challenge whether it ever existed; yet, he also points out historical evidence supporting its existence, possibly in Ethiopia. The imagery in this documentary is beautiful and Gardiner elaborates on the ""altered state of consciousness"" that comes with spiritual enlightenment.

Topics discussed include who truly was imaged on the Shroud of Turin, the relevance the Shroud has to the Ark of the Covenant, why Mary is just as important as the Ark or the Shroud, scientific evidence that reveals just how the Shroud was made, a re-dating of the Shroud, an ancient Brotherhood that protects its secrets, and much more.
