391872,A51IK68MWKV5R,6303954367,"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies""","[1, 2]","I had brought out an old video of things I had taped off television, and this was on it.  I was never really a fan of Star Trek, although I did watch the first few seasons of Next Generation, so I was a little skeptical going in. (I had only taped it to begin with because this last episode was hyped so much.)Patrick Stewart really gets a chance to flex his acting muscles here.  He is surely doing better acting in this than he's been allowed to do lately.  He has to play the same character in three different time periods, all the time trying to not let on to anyone else (because they wouldn't understand) that he is time-traveling.  Plus, he never knows when a ""jump"" will take place, and so is having to explain himself saying out loud something he said in the previous time period.  It's pretty complicated, but done so well that it becomes easy to follow.This was obviously written to end the series with a bang.  Q is here and he's ""putting mankind on trial"" again, as he apparently has done before.  (Like I said, I haven't seen one of these in years, so Q was new to me.)  There is a spatial anomaly involved that destroys humanity and it's up to Jean-Luc (Stewart) to stop it...because he started it!  Things unfold at an alarming rate, meanwhile the time-shifting becomes more erratic, not allowing Picard to stay in one place for very long.It was fun to see the old crew members again, especially Denise Crosby's Lt. Yar (I stopped watching the show soon after her demise).  It was also fun to learn what happens to them in the future (some surprising discoveries are made).  On the downside, I've never liked Captain Riker (he always come across as a--how can I say this?--a real phallus), although he does resemble Orson Welles (especially aged) so that's a point in his favor.  Fortunately, he is not around much.  Unfortunately, when he is around, he's doing noble things, so I can't hate him.John de Lancie is Q and he overacts as expected (what else can you do when you spend all your screen time on a floating throne?), but as a whole, this was a very entertaining experience and I would recommend it to non-fans like myself.",4,A review for the non-fans,1027468800,"07 24, 2002",2002,2147,"['had', 'brought', 'out', 'old', 'video', 'things', 'had', 'taped', 'off', 'television', 'was', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'fan', 'Star', 'Trek', 'did', 'watch', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'Next', 'Generation', 'was', 'little', 'skeptical', 'going', 'had', 'only', 'taped', 'begin', 'last', 'episode', 'was', 'hyped', 'so', 'much', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'really', 'chance', 'flex', 'acting', 'muscles', 'here', 'surely', 'doing', 'better', 'acting', 'been', 'allowed', 'do', 'lately', 'play', 'same', 'character', 'three', 'different', 'time', 'periods', 'time', 'trying', 'not', 'let', 'anyone', 'else', 'would', ""n't"", 'understand', 'time-traveling', 'never', 'when', 'jump', 'will', 'take', 'place', 'so', 'having', 'explain', 'saying', 'out', 'loud', 'something', 'said', 'previous', 'time', 'period', 'pretty', 'complicated', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'easy', 'follow.This', 'was', 'obviously', 'written', 'end', 'series', 'bang', 'Q', 'here', 'putting', 'mankind', 'trial', 'again', 'apparently', 'done', 'before', 'said', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', 'years', 'so', 'Q', 'was', 'new', 'spatial', 'anomaly', 'involved', 'humanity', 'up', 'Jean-Luc', 'Stewart', 'stop', 'started', 'Things', 'unfold', 'alarming', 'rate', 'meanwhile', 'time-shifting', 'becomes', 'more', 'erratic', 'not', 'allowing', 'Picard', 'stay', 'one', 'place', 'very', 'long.It', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'old', 'crew', 'members', 'again', 'especially', 'Denise', 'Crosby', 'Lt.', 'Yar', 'stopped', 'watching', 'show', 'soon', 'demise', 'was', 'also', 'fun', 'learn', 'what', 'future', 'surprising', 'discoveries', 'are', 'made', 'downside', ""'ve"", 'never', 'liked', 'Captain', 'Riker', 'always', 'come', 'how', 'can', 'say', 'real', 'phallus', 'resemble', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'especially', 'aged', 'point', 'favor', 'Fortunately', 'not', 'around', 'much', 'Unfortunately', 'when', 'around', 'doing', 'noble', 'things', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hate', 'him.John', 'Lancie', 'Q', 'expected', 'what', 'else', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'spend', 'screen', 'time', 'floating', 'throne', 'whole', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'experience', 'would', 'recommend', 'non-fans']","Star Trek - The Next Generation, Episode 177: All Good Things...The Final Episode '94-'95  VHS"

391874,A3L2U581LL17EB,6303954367,Eric,"[4, 4]","While the original crew had it better with the movies, The Next Generation was the only Star Trek TV series that I watched consistently. The show had a cast that at least equalled that of the original, boasted better production values, and plots that were intriguing and touched on varieties of concepts that Kirk, Spock, and Bones never got the chance to explore. Deep Space Nine was too mired into the whole &quot;war of the quadrants&quot; to explore any ideas with real satisfaction, and while Voyager had the best effects and the best premise, the cast was middling at best. As for Enterprise, hell, I tried to watch one episode and got too damn bored.All Good Things..., the swan song episode for TNG, is possibly the best of Star Trek, period, focusing on mind-boggling concepts while retaining the character development and human interest that made the show so appealing. It's the seventh year that the crew of the Starhip Enterprise have been together, but Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) is experiencing odd timeshifts. He's constantly switching between three different time periods; to the past, right before the Farpoint mission, the present, and the future, where the crew has long since split up, Picard is retired and is diagnosed with a debilitating mental illness. Naturally, the rest of the crew is skeptical (be it in any time period), but when Picard discovers the true nature of his constant shifting, he realizes it is both the means and cause with which the existence of mankind could be erased.I hesitate to give too much away, though I doubt anyone with a passing interest in Star Trek hasn't already seen this episode. But it plays as an interesting comparison and contrast to the series' first episode, Encounter at Farpoint, which it directly ties in to with Picard's timeshifting to the past. There's been a notable improvement in the quality of the sets and the visual effects, and also the acting, the pacing, and the plot development.All Good Things... has all the solid acting one expects from the cast, and a human touch that was missing from the latest film, Nemesis. It's interesting to note that this episode (meaning the whole series, as well) ends with the door open for all sorts of possibilites; at this time, this clearly implied the much-hyped transition to the big screen.Unfortunately, some of the more open-ended questions this episode focused on were never even touched on. Sure, the Worf/Troi/Riker triangle was resolved, but one of my favorite ongoing side stories, the burgeoning romance between Picard and Dr. Crusher, was completely ignored in the movies. And the final scenes lead one to believe that the movies would take us to &quot;places&quot; never explored, even though the most recent film was merely a plotless action movie that didn't even have enough action to warrant the movie's existence.Stewart is the true highlight of this episode, displaying the great acting chops he's been known for. The fact that we care for him and the rest of the crew as well, adds a sense of urgency and involvement in the proceedings that the otherwise quite frantic pace alone might not have been able to develop. The plot twists are pure Trek, each mysterious element giving away to some big revelation that only leads to more questions. The story is engrossing, the dialogue is strong, and the performances and characterizations are spot-on.There are a few problems with All Good Things. The timeshifting obviously means we're going to see past and future versions of the cast, but everyone's aged to the extent where they can't quite pass for their more youthful selves, and the old-age makeup is never entirely convincing (Old Riker's first appearance gave me a good laugh). That said, I would like to make mention of what full-blown hotties Marina Sirtis and especially Gates McFadden became (McFadden is easily the most attractive post 50-year old actress I've ever seen).The continuing movie series actually began quite well; Generations and First Contact were enjoyable adventures, but everything seemed to fall apart with Insurrection.

One moment he is twenty-five years in the future, a retired ambassador tending his vineyard but suffering from Irumodic syndrome, a degenerative neurological disease. The next he finds himself seven years in the past, at the time when he took over the Enterprise and headed for their first adventure at Farpoint Station (Episodes 1 &amp; 2).  In the present timeline the Enterprise is sent to the Romulan Neutral Zone to investigate an anomaly that has appeared in the Devron system.  The Romulans are also investigating the anomaly in force.  In the past the Enterprise heads off to investigate the anomaly as well, which convinces Picard that they must go to the Devron system in that timeline as well.  Without access to the Enterprise, Picard receives help from Captain Beverly Crusher, captain of the medical ship the USS Pasteur (and Picard's ex-wife).  With La Forge and Data on board they receive permission to enter Klingon Territory from Governor Worf.  In the past timeline Picard finally knows who is responsible for his time shifting and finds himself once again in the courtroom Q created to try humanity in &quot;Encounter at Farpoint.&quot;  Apparently the trial never officially ended and the Continuum has finally reached a verdict.  The human race should be destroyed, but the Q do not have to do anything for this to happen.  The anomaly is going back in time, growing larger as it does, until it will arrive at Earth at the pivotal moment when life is created--and prevent it.  Now only will there never be life on Earth explain Q, but Picard will be the one who caused it.Most fans rightfully think &quot;All Good Things...&quot; is superior to the trio of STNG films that have been produced so far.  The future time line allows us to find out what happens to the Enterprise crew down the road: Picard a diplomat who managed to marry and divorce Beverly Crusher in the interim, La Forge without his visor, Data a professor at Cambridge, Worf an embittered Klingon, Riker the captain of the next generation Enterprise, and veiled references to something not very nice happening to Troi.  The past timeline brings back Tasha Yar and Miles O'Brien, effectively getting the entire gang back together (except for Guinan, who would have been very useful in an episode dealing with time problems).  At stake in the episode is all life on Earth, which certainly is a problem big enough for the finale STNG episode.  At the heart of the story, as he has always been throughout the series, is Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard.  As his ex-wife says in the future when she becomes convinced he is telling the truth about what is happening, &quot;He's Jean-Luc Picard.

It all fits.Led by Patrick Stewart and John DeLancie, the acting is top notch (Q's final speech brought tears to my eyes).Like Shakespeare's Sonnet 73, this episode is also all the sweeter because you know that it is the last. This was clearly a labor of love. It's also the rare final episode that leaves us clearly wanting more -- I can remember the merciful endings to Cheers and Seinfeld, two excellent series that had long past become parodies of themselves. With TNG, so many of us fans just wanted one more year...but if we had gotten it, would we have enjoyed the probably mediocre results?Alas, All Good Things, even the best things, must come to an end.BTW, Paramount, us fans want this on DVD, and we want it with all the fixin's -- interviews, outtakes, lost scenes, et al.Enjoy!",5,A wonderful capstone to a fabulous run.

391882,A243HY69GIAHFI,6303954367,tropic_of_criticism,"[9, 9]","The reason this is one of the best series finales in all of television history is that it's clearly a labor of love on behalf of the show's fans.  Unlike some series ends which merely include gratuitous flashback, or which portray a significant event such as marriage, ""All Good Things"" is 100 minutes of innovative plot that pays homage to the entire run of the series.  Building on the very first episode of the show, it creates in effect a ""bookend"" to tie the series together.  At the same time it closes out the show, it also prognosticates about what's to come and shows us a bit of series' origin.  Better still, it does so by affirming the most idealistic of Star Trek's core values, preferring to be an episode about exploration rather than conquest.What makes it most impressive, however, is that it's ultimately about the relationships among the various crewmates.  This, more than the plot-induced time trippin'--shows how far the show has come.  Gone are those initial days of painfully awkward dialogue that made Denise Crosby (whose Tasha Yar thankfully reappears here) leave the show.  No, just as THE WRATH OF KHAN is arguably the best Star Trek movie involving the original cast, ""All Good Things"" succeeds most because we get to see what these characters mean to each other.It's such an effective blending of dynamic plot, fan wish-fulfillment, and amazing acting (especially by Patrick Stewart), that one hopes that future editions of this story will be treated more like a movie than a mere episode.  Though Paramount doesn't have a particularly great track record of making feature-rich DVD versions of Star Trek movies, hopefully one day they'll release ""All Good Things"" on DVD with behind-the-scenes featurettes, and cast and crew commentaries.",5,&quot;All Good Things&quot; ain't a misnomer,976060800,"12 6, 2000",2000,1769,"['reason', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'finales', 'television', 'history', 'clearly', 'labor', 'love', 'behalf', 'show', 'fans', 'series', 'merely', 'include', 'gratuitous', 'flashback', 'portray', 'significant', 'event', 'such', 'marriage', 'Good', 'Things', '100', 'minutes', 'innovative', 'plot', 'homage', 'entire', 'run', 'series', 'Building', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'show', 'effect', 'bookend', 'tie', 'series', 'together', 'same', 'time', 'out', 'show', 'also', 'what', 'come', 'bit', 'series', 'origin', 'Better', 'still', 'so', 'affirming', 'most', 'idealistic', 'Star', 'Trek', 'core', 'values', 'preferring', 'be', 'episode', 'exploration', 'rather', 'conquest.What', 'most', 'impressive', 'however', 'ultimately', 'relationships', 'various', 'crewmates', 'more', 'plot-induced', 'time', 'trippin', 'how', 'far', 'show', 'come', 'Gone', 'are', 'initial', 'days', 'painfully', 'awkward', 'dialogue', 'made', 'Denise', 'Crosby', 'Tasha', 'Yar', 'thankfully', 'here', 'leave', 'show', 'No', 'just', 'THE', 'WRATH', 'OF', 'KHAN', 'arguably', 'best', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movie', 'involving', 'original', 'cast', 'Good', 'Things', 'most', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'characters', 'mean', 'other.It', 'such', 'effective', 'blending', 'dynamic', 'plot', 'fan', 'wish-fulfillment', 'amazing', 'acting', 'especially', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'one', 'future', 'editions', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'treated', 'more', 'movie', 'mere', 'episode', 'Paramount', ""n't"", 'have', 'particularly', 'great', 'track', 'record', 'making', 'feature-rich', 'DVD', 'versions', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movies', 'hopefully', 'one', 'day', ""'ll"", 'release', 'Good', 'Things', 'DVD', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'cast', 'crew', 'commentaries']","Star Trek - The Next Generation, Episode 177: All Good Things...The Final Episode '94-'95  VHS"
