She becomes a teacher of a music class of rowdy students and turning them into a choir so they can enter an all state music competetion to win back the school. Lauryn Hill plays Rita Waltson who can sing really good but hides it because of her mother who hates music.This movie was kind of funny. But all the nuns arent in the movie they're in just one scene in the movie. These teenagers were bad for the first part of the movie why did the nuns choose them to be the ones to save the school. I just didn't like it as much as the first one but it still a good movie. Just see it if you like! These kids can sing good though.,3,Whoopi still rules!!!

I could feel Whoopi Goldberg's Sister Mary Clarence when she first walked into that out of control classroom.  The blatant disrespect they showed her was realistic.The way she gained the class's respect made me pay attention.  It was what you would hope a good teacher would do.  As a matter of fact, the class and the teacher in this movie were based on a real teacher and her music class. I remember seeing the real teacher and her class on a talk show in 1995.But the class in the movie had Lauryn Hill.  She lit up the screen as the attitudinal Rita Watson.  Her mother, portrayed by Sheryl Lee Ralph, had much to do with the Rita's poor attitude, we later find out.  Yet somehow, Sister Mary Clarence is able to get through to Rita and she is able to do what she does best--sing.The singing in this movie is phenomenal!  The musical arrangements took this movie to another level than the original movie.  In fact, the scenes with just the nuns singing are flat and dull by comparison to the scenes with the teenagers.There's a line in the movie, ""What she's done with those children is nothing short of miraculous.""  You get caught up in that `miraculous' watching the movie.  And you laugh.  And you cry.  And you want to watch it again and again and again.

359641,A12YVS06GZEFZE,6303140157,Barbara Farr Kelley,"[0, 11]","I did not like Sister Act (Back in the Habit) at all.  The kids in it were so mean and so rebellious at the first, gluing Sister Mary Clarence to her chair, that I could not forgive them.  Even though they won the singing  championship, I did not feel they deserved it.  I really thought the group  that when they sang, the St. Francis girls said, &quot;They're good,  they're really, really good,&quot; should have won first place.I loved  Whoopi and the nuns, and I really took a liking to Father Thomas and  Ignacious.  My favorite part of the movie was where Father Thomas was  driving the bus, and he really should not have been.  It was pretty  funny.However, I'm only rating this movie two stars because I felt the  kids in it did not need to behave the way they did.  I have no respect for  children who do whatever the heck they want to do, even when their parent  objects, and then gets a sweet little slap on the back for doing it.  I  feel Rita's mother should have been a little angrier at being disobeyed,  even though I felt the mother, too, was wrong in thinking you couldn't put  food on the table with singing.  I happen to love singing, I sing at  church.  And if singing couldn't put food on the table, then what about all  those Christian singers like Sandi Patti and Michael W. Smith who do just  fine eating and singing?I feel this movie could have been a lot better  planned than it was, and if there is ever a Sister Act 3, I hope it is more  like the first one.",2,Not as good as Sister Act 1,960076800,"06 4, 2000",2000,1487,"['did', 'not', 'Sister', 'Act', 'Back', 'Habit', 'kids', 'were', 'so', 'mean', 'so', 'rebellious', 'first', 'gluing', 'Sister', 'Mary', 'Clarence', 'chair', 'could', 'not', 'forgive', 'Even', 'won', 'singing', 'championship', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'deserved', 'really', 'thought', 'group', 'when', 'sang', 'St.', 'Francis', 'girls', 'said', 'quot', ""'re"", 'good', ""'re"", 'really', 'really', 'good', 'quot', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'first', 'place.I', 'loved', 'Whoopi', 'nuns', 'really', 'took', 'liking', 'Father', 'Thomas', 'Ignacious', 'favorite', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'where', 'Father', 'Thomas', 'was', 'driving', 'bus', 'really', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny.However', ""'m"", 'only', 'rating', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'felt', 'kids', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'behave', 'way', 'did', 'have', 'respect', 'children', 'who', 'do', 'whatever', 'heck', 'want', 'do', 'even', 'when', 'parent', 'objects', 'then', 'sweet', 'little', 'slap', 'back', 'doing', 'feel', 'Rita', 'mother', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'angrier', 'being', 'disobeyed', 'even', 'felt', 'mother', 'too', 'was', 'wrong', 'thinking', 'could', ""n't"", 'put', 'food', 'table', 'singing', 'happen', 'love', 'singing', 'sing', 'church', 'singing', 'could', ""n't"", 'put', 'food', 'table', 'then', 'what', 'Christian', 'singers', 'Sandi', 'Patti', 'Michael', 'W.', 'Smith', 'who', 'do', 'just', 'fine', 'eating', 'singing', 'feel', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'planned', 'was', 'ever', 'Sister', 'Act', '3', 'hope', 'more', 'first', 'one']",Sister Act 2 VHS
359642,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6303140157,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","This is a different movie in many respects, with the only common thread being Doloris Van Cartier aka Sister Mary Clarence (Whoopi Goldberg) and a couple of the other nuns, including Mother Superior (Maggie Smith). Before, Doloris was disguised as a nun involuntarily to keep her identity and location secret in a witness protection program. This time Mother Superior sends her old friends to fetch her from a headliner show in Las Vegas. She returns voluntarily to the habit in order to help save St. Francis Academy in San Francisco, where she went to school so disastrously as a child.Also, this time she's not teaching nuns, she's teaching adolescents. That makes it a totally different story right there. What could be a simple remake of ""Going My Way"" or ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" is redeemed by the kids themselves. There's some very competent acting, and some truly excellent singing and dancing among these kids. The interaction with Sister Mary Clarence is great fun and very involving.The story about a misanthropic school official (James Coburn) and a skeptical principal is just the frosting on the cake. Yes, the story is repleat with cliches, like the state-wide competition which will somehow save the school from being closed. But if you simply allow the story to be the trivia it really is, you can have a lot of fun, and find yourself rooting for the talented kids against all odds, even their well-intentioned but emotionally hardened mothers. We had to have one that had a mother who refused her permission. We had to have at least one person in the school who is openly against the school choir be converted at the last minute by how very talented they are, and they had to win the competition against impressive odds, largely due to a major pep-talk by Whoopi.So what if it's a corny movie?
