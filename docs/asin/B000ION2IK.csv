The ISG is a true gem in Boston--and it's elegaic with its empty frames of Vermeers, Rembrandts, etc. There are connections with the IRA, political intrigue involving the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, and the tragic figure of James Harold Smith, the sleuth who suffered from skin cancer for 50 years. Campbell Scott voices Bernard Berenson, Isabella's art dealer. The mannered, Victorian-era correspondences provide a counterpoint to the intrigue and mystery.""Stolen"" is heartbreaking and intriguing about a mystery that still remains unsolved.",5,Stolen Away,1275523200,"06 3, 2010",2010,656,"['Stolen', 'compelling', 'documentary', 'still', 'unsolved', 'mystery', 'Isabella', 'Stewart', 'Gardner', 'Museum', 'theft', 'ISG', 'true', 'gem', 'Boston', 'elegaic', 'empty', 'frames', 'Vermeers', 'Rembrandts', 'etc', 'are', 'connections', 'IRA', 'political', 'intrigue', 'involving', 'late', 'Sen.', 'Edward', 'Kennedy', 'tragic', 'figure', 'James', 'Harold', 'Smith', 'sleuth', 'who', 'suffered', 'skin', 'cancer', '50', 'years', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'voices', 'Bernard', 'Berenson', 'Isabella', 'art', 'dealer', 'mannered', 'Victorian-era', 'correspondences', 'provide', 'counterpoint', 'intrigue', 'mystery', 'Stolen', 'heartbreaking', 'intriguing', 'mystery', 'still', 'unsolved']",Stolen

I loved that part. Actually, the first black and white picture that they should of her bust she reminded me of the wicked witch from the Wizard of Oz. I think it was the outfit.

This is a really compelling documentary about the infamous are heist at the Gardner Museum in 1990.  It is frustrating and sad to have these works missing and perhaps poorly maintained.  The characters involved in the story range from a devoted stolen art private investigator who has had skin cancer for 50 years to FBI agents and con artists who are all involved in the game of getting them back.
