1254010,AG6DVGP6EIMTA,B0027CSPYM,"C. Campbell ""Music collector""","[0, 0]","This set wasn't cheap but I decided to order myself the entire Scrubs eight seasons for a Christmas present. It came fast, in perfect condition, freshly wrapped from the factory, and no glitches.  The show just grabbed me - I'm an adult, female - but somehow am drawn to this collection of driven and dedicated characters; all except two: the janitor and Ted the lawyer.  Those two never got beyond 2-dimension to me, even though they were given girlfriends at the end, but all the others, especially the big five (J.D., Elliot, Turk, Carla & Perry) plus Jordan and Dr. Kelso -- all came through solidly with both warts and heart.  There are so many quotable lines, I am on my second watching to get them in my head for good.  The flashbacks are a brilliant touch in this show -- you see enormous set-ups for a 5-second payoff in Zach's imagination playing out for us to see.The audio commentaries are fair, but add to the appreciation of what was going on with the actors.  Bill Lawrence spends a good bit of time groaning about his mistakes, which I certainly don't see.  You learn that they actually got to inhabit an empty hospital building, fallen on hard economic times -- so the backdrops are all accurate.  It's cute to see how many of them say they had no idea what the medical terminology meant as they were saying it.  But it works.  It really works like Mash worked, because they inject serious issues along with the sophomoric humor, immaturity, character flaws, etc.  The show is quite deep - considering they touch on race, death, authority, and sex (well everyone touches on sex).",5,My perfect Christmas gift - the complete Scrubs,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,1596,"['set', 'was', ""n't"", 'cheap', 'decided', 'order', 'entire', 'Scrubs', 'eight', 'seasons', 'Christmas', 'present', 'came', 'fast', 'perfect', 'condition', 'freshly', 'wrapped', 'factory', 'glitches', 'show', 'just', 'grabbed', ""'m"", 'adult', 'female', 'somehow', 'am', 'drawn', 'collection', 'driven', 'dedicated', 'characters', 'two', 'janitor', 'Ted', 'lawyer', 'two', 'never', 'got', '2-dimension', 'even', 'were', 'given', 'girlfriends', 'end', 'others', 'especially', 'big', 'five', 'J.D.', 'Elliot', 'Turk', 'Carla', 'Perry', 'Jordan', 'Dr.', 'Kelso', 'came', 'solidly', 'warts', 'heart', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'quotable', 'lines', 'am', 'second', 'watching', 'get', 'head', 'good', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'brilliant', 'touch', 'show', 'see', 'enormous', 'set-ups', '5-second', 'payoff', 'Zach', 'imagination', 'playing', 'out', 'see.The', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'are', 'fair', 'add', 'appreciation', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'actors', 'Bill', 'Lawrence', 'good', 'bit', 'time', 'groaning', 'mistakes', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'learn', 'actually', 'got', 'inhabit', 'empty', 'hospital', 'building', 'fallen', 'hard', 'economic', 'times', 'backdrops', 'are', 'accurate', 'cute', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'say', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'medical', 'terminology', 'meant', 'were', 'saying', 'really', 'Mash', 'worked', 'inject', 'serious', 'issues', 'sophomoric', 'humor', 'immaturity', 'character', 'flaws', 'etc', 'show', 'quite', 'deep', 'considering', 'touch', 'race', 'death', 'authority', 'sex', 'well', 'everyone', 'touches', 'sex']",N/A
1254011,A1IM4D3R61A2K0,B0027CSPYM,DR. B,"[2, 3]","Scrubs was a great series, funny and touching at the same time.  The first 7 seasons are almost as good as any on TV.  One of the few shows that can make you laugh and cry in one eipisode.  Never got the respect it should have, don't know why.  The eight season showed a terrible decline in just about all areas, not really funny, tries to be touching but came off heavy handed when it does, it seems 2-3 characters were off every episode (to save money or had they given up?).But buy it for the first 7 seasons, watch the 8th for the few gems and do what you wish for season nine.

It's a show for adults as there is some mild sexual content in most episodes.  I would call it family appropriate however because there isn't obscene language or nudity, but more euphemisms and double meanings.  It's a clever show with a wacky side and some poignant social commentary thrown in.  This is not a medical drama although there are dramatic moments.  Every side character is compelling and entertaining to watch.For me it's the ultimate pick me up show if I'm bored or stressed and need something to take my mind off life.",5,What's not to like?,1300233600,"03 16, 2011",2011,643,"[""'re"", 'reading', 'review', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'getting', 'gift', 'someone', 'so', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'show', 'adults', 'mild', 'sexual', 'content', 'most', 'episodes', 'would', 'call', 'family', 'appropriate', 'however', ""n't"", 'obscene', 'language', 'nudity', 'more', 'euphemisms', 'double', 'meanings', 'clever', 'show', 'wacky', 'side', 'poignant', 'social', 'commentary', 'thrown', 'not', 'medical', 'drama', 'are', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'side', 'character', 'compelling', 'entertaining', 'watch.For', 'ultimate', 'pick', 'show', ""'m"", 'bored', 'stressed', 'need', 'something', 'take', 'mind', 'life']",N/A

But now I am saved! I have hummed and hawed for a long time about whether or not to justify the expense of $20 - $30 a season to round out my collection which ends with season three. Then Amazon threw this on a daily deal and I finally couldn't say no. I bought it. I got it. And I love it. What separates this show from the rest is the strong, big ensemble cast and the implementation of wonderful music and the show's profound (sometimes) moral lending. This show hits you with great writing, acting, story lines, and character development and truly shouldn't be missed. If you're on the fence about buying the whole shebang, then get season one.
