370659,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,6303364772,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[2, 3]","Leave Her to Heaven starring Gene Tierney and Cornel Wilde is an interesting little film to say the least. Tierney is gorgeous as ever and she freaks you out too playing a manipulative, jealous woman who will stop at nothing to have her new hubby all to her self. She would kill for him, lie for him, and boy does she ever. It's not a perfect movie but it's good enough to watch every now and then. If you are a Gene Tierney fan like I am than Leave Her to Heaven is the movie for you.

370660,AGEIT17HENDIS,6303364772,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 3]","I take my femme fatales on the low-down side. Gals like Mary Astor clawing for gold and that damn bird as the corpses pile up in The Maltese Falcon or Rita Hayworth getting guys, rational guys in most matters, to commit murder and mayhem just for a slight glance from those dancing eyes. Or, well, you get my drift. So when I run up against a high society femme like Ellen (played by demure, sort of on the surface, Gene Tierney) in the film under review, Leave Her To Heaven, I am not sure what to make of the situation. She doesn't need dough, she doesn't need a guy really (or she can have the pick of Back Bay Boston and other high tone watering spots as they line up six deep for her favors), or fame and glory. So what gives?What gives is that our dear Ellen is a control freak, and an unrestrained sort when she hones in on her target. And her psycho behavior drives the plot here as she targets one bright star Mayfair swell literary man Richard (played by Cornel Wilde) to see if she can clip his wings. She tries through thick and thin to reduce her world to one (and almost succeeds as she already had driven her father off the edge, Richard's brother, her unborn baby and was deep into setting her foster-sister Ruth, played by Jeanne Crain, before the wheels came off). My thought though as the story dragged on was that she should have just been sent over to McLean's Hospital in Boston for a little rest. Say for about ten to twelve years.

This may or may not have affected my opinion of it.Leave Her to Heaven is an enjoyable (albeit over the top) melodrama of jealousy and fatal love. Gene Tierney plays a woman who will stop at nothing to keep her new husband all to herself. Tierney throws herself into her part as the ultimate femme fatale with obvious relish. In fact, whenever she on screen and wicked, the movie glistens. The two most famous scenes in the movie, and justly so, are the drowning scene and the fall down the stairs. Both are well directed and both are basically one woman shows. She richly deserved her Oscar nomination.The supporting cast is competant for the most part but none of them come close to Tierney's preformance and perhaps the movie suffers a bit from it. Also, I felt there that a lot of time passed between the introduction of Tierney's character and her first really wicked act. (It was more obvious in the book that she was diabolic)Still, in spite of it's short comings, this is a well put together moie and if your taste runs toward old fashioned melodrama then you will find this movie an enjoyable though flawed work that provides a decent evenings entertainment.Obviously, I will not include a laundrey list of instances where the book and movie differed but I do encourage everyone to try out the book, it is very good and gets more into the head of the jealous, lovely Ellen.",3,Good 40s Melodrama,1020470400,"05 4, 2002",2002,1481,"['starting', 'review', 'think', 'should', 'mention', 'read', 'book', 'saw', 'movie', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'affected', 'opinion', 'it.Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'enjoyable', 'top', 'melodrama', 'jealousy', 'fatal', 'love', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'keep', 'new', 'husband', 'Tierney', 'part', 'ultimate', 'femme', 'fatale', 'obvious', 'relish', 'fact', 'whenever', 'screen', 'wicked', 'movie', 'glistens', 'two', 'most', 'famous', 'scenes', 'movie', 'justly', 'so', 'are', 'drowning', 'scene', 'fall', 'down', 'stairs', 'are', 'well', 'directed', 'are', 'basically', 'one', 'woman', 'richly', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'competant', 'most', 'part', 'none', 'come', 'close', 'Tierney', 'preformance', 'perhaps', 'movie', 'bit', 'Also', 'felt', 'lot', 'time', 'passed', 'introduction', 'Tierney', 'character', 'first', 'really', 'wicked', 'act', 'was', 'more', 'obvious', 'book', 'was', 'diabolic', 'Still', 'spite', 'short', 'comings', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'moie', 'taste', 'old', 'fashioned', 'melodrama', 'then', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'though', 'flawed', 'work', 'decent', 'evenings', 'entertainment.Obviously', 'will', 'not', 'include', 'laundrey', 'list', 'instances', 'where', 'book', 'movie', 'differed', 'do', 'encourage', 'everyone', 'try', 'out', 'book', 'very', 'good', 'more', 'head', 'jealous', 'lovely', 'Ellen']",N/A

I agree with the preceding reviews, and want to add a few things that weren't mentioned.  First, Cornel Wilde is fabulous in the role.  I know this is a  controversial statement, but his underacting was exactly right.  He hasn't  gotten enough credit over the years, in my opinion.  In a way, his  performance in this movie is a lot like Montgomery Clift's in &quot;The  Heiress&quot;; understated, exactly right for the movie.  Clift, like  Wilde, hasn't gotten anything like the credit he deserves.  Also, no one  has mentioned Vincent Price's role as the district attorney.  I wondered at  first what he was doing in this movie, as a competitor to Wilde for Gene  Tierney's affections.  But when we get to the courtroom scene at the end,  Socko!  His timing as a cross-examiner should be required viewing for law  students (and I think I know what I'm saying, being a law professor and a  litigator).  As for the &quot;breathtaking&quot; scenery in the movie,  well, I don't go to the movies to whistle the scenery.  It was a tad  distracting, but not overly so.  John M. Stahl did a spectacular job  directing; you can tell when you don't notice the direction at all.  I  think this has a lot to do with the editing and cutting; there were great  editors back in those days, people who cared about continuity and didn't  call attention to themselves.  If &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; were made  with today's directors and editors, it would by-pass the theatres and be  released as silently as possible to the video rental stores.",4,They Don't Make 'Em Like This Any More,963792000,"07 17, 2000",2000,1586,"['soap', 'opera', 'be', 'sure', 'what', 'soap', 'opera', 'agree', 'preceding', 'reviews', 'want', 'add', 'few', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'First', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'fabulous', 'role', 'know', 'controversial', 'statement', 'underacting', 'was', 'exactly', 'right', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'enough', 'credit', 'years', 'opinion', 'way', 'performance', 'movie', 'lot', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'quot', 'Heiress', 'quot', 'understated', 'exactly', 'right', 'movie', 'Clift', 'Wilde', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'anything', 'credit', 'Also', 'one', 'mentioned', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'role', 'district', 'attorney', 'wondered', 'first', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'movie', 'competitor', 'Wilde', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'affections', 'when', 'get', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'end', 'Socko', 'timing', 'cross-examiner', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'law', 'students', 'think', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'saying', 'being', 'law', 'professor', 'litigator', 'quot', 'breathtaking', 'quot', 'scenery', 'movie', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'movies', 'whistle', 'scenery', 'was', 'tad', 'distracting', 'not', 'overly', 'so', 'John', 'M.', 'Stahl', 'did', 'spectacular', 'job', 'directing', 'can', 'tell', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'direction', 'think', 'lot', 'do', 'editing', 'cutting', 'were', 'great', 'editors', 'back', 'days', 'people', 'who', 'cared', 'continuity', 'did', ""n't"", 'call', 'attention', 'quot', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'quot', 'were', 'made', 'today', 'directors', 'editors', 'would', 'by-pass', 'theatres', 'be', 'released', 'as', 'silently', 'possible', 'video', 'rental', 'stores']",N/A

370666,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6303364772,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 3]","I never knew anything more about this movie than its title until a couple of hours ago [February 2010]. But I get the feeling I may have read the book, or perhaps something else which is derivative, because it seemed pretty predictable to me in those parts that were obviously supposed to be surprising. Perhaps I am simply too cynical.Ellen Berent (Gene Tierney) is of that classic film stereotype: beautiful, wealthy, strong-willed and totally spoiled. Dick Harland (Cornel Wilde) is a young writer who falls under her spell when he sees her reading his latest book on a train to go visit an old friend. Turns out she is visiting the same guy, who is her uncle, I think.Even though Ellen was engaged to marry ambitious young attorney Russell Quinton (Vincent Price; yes, he was young once), she stops wearing her engagement ring, then telegraphs to Quinton that she has done so and that she's going to marry Dick Harland. Problem is, Harland hasn't asked her yet. But when Quinton storms in and confronts her with her cruelty to him, there stands Harland, who does not have the heart to contradict her in front of everyone. And as soon as they are alone, she asks Harland to marry her.He does. How long does it take him to regret it? You will have to judge that for yourself.Danny Harland, Dick's younger brother, will look strangely familiar to Baby Boomers. That's because his younger brother played Dobie Gillis. This is Darryl Hickman, older brother to Dwaye, who was Dobie. He also was a guest on Dobie Gillis a few times, playing (naturally) Dobie's older brother. Anyway, Danny is crippled, but slowly regaining the use of his legs. He credits his new sister-in-law with helping him and encouraging him, and eventually went from wheelchair to crutches with her help. But when they go to the lake, and he takes up swimming (excellent exercise for atrophied leg muscles), it's rather another story.Then there's Ellen's younger cousin and adopted sister Ruth (Jeanne Crain). She's pretty, she's sweet, and she's pleasant to her new brother-in-law and his younger brother. But for some reason, she and her sister don't get along. Wonder why?There's one more person you may recognize, also amazingly young (we forget how long ago 1946 really is until we see these changes). Chill Wills plays Leick Thorne, Dick's old friend and caretaker of his lakeside cottage, Back of the Moon. Real young, but real recognizable, both in face and in voice.A good movie, possibly even very good. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that, as I said, the plot was more predictable than the suspenseful preview seemed to suggest. It seems a paste-together of several books and movies of its past.  Still, it is old enough that perhaps this story came first, at least in book form.",4,Another Fine Old Drama,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,2778,"['never', 'knew', 'anything', 'more', 'movie', 'title', 'couple', 'hours', 'ago', '[', 'February', '2010', ']', 'get', 'feeling', 'may', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'perhaps', 'something', 'else', 'derivative', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'parts', 'were', 'obviously', 'supposed', 'be', 'surprising', 'Perhaps', 'am', 'simply', 'too', 'cynical.Ellen', 'Berent', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'classic', 'film', 'stereotype', 'beautiful', 'wealthy', 'strong-willed', 'totally', 'spoiled', 'Dick', 'Harland', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'young', 'writer', 'who', 'spell', 'when', 'reading', 'latest', 'book', 'train', 'go', 'visit', 'old', 'friend', 'out', 'visiting', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'uncle', 'think.Even', 'Ellen', 'was', 'engaged', 'marry', 'ambitious', 'young', 'attorney', 'Russell', 'Quinton', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'yes', 'was', 'young', 'once', 'wearing', 'engagement', 'ring', 'then', 'Quinton', 'done', 'so', 'going', 'marry', 'Dick', 'Harland', 'Problem', 'Harland', ""n't"", 'asked', 'yet', 'when', 'Quinton', 'confronts', 'cruelty', 'Harland', 'who', 'not', 'have', 'heart', 'contradict', 'front', 'everyone', 'as', 'soon', 'are', 'alone', 'Harland', 'marry', 'her.He', 'How', 'long', 'take', 'regret', 'will', 'have', 'judge', 'yourself.Danny', 'Harland', 'Dick', 'younger', 'brother', 'will', 'look', 'strangely', 'familiar', 'Baby', 'Boomers', 'younger', 'brother', 'played', 'Dobie', 'Gillis', 'Darryl', 'Hickman', 'older', 'brother', 'Dwaye', 'who', 'was', 'Dobie', 'also', 'was', 'guest', 'Dobie', 'Gillis', 'few', 'times', 'playing', 'naturally', 'Dobie', 'older', 'brother', 'Anyway', 'Danny', 'crippled', 'slowly', 'regaining', 'use', 'legs', 'new', 'sister-in-law', 'helping', 'encouraging', 'eventually', 'went', 'wheelchair', 'crutches', 'help', 'when', 'go', 'lake', 'up', 'swimming', 'excellent', 'exercise', 'atrophied', 'leg', 'muscles', 'rather', 'story.Then', 'Ellen', 'younger', 'cousin', 'adopted', 'sister', 'Ruth', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'pretty', 'sweet', 'pleasant', 'new', 'brother-in-law', 'younger', 'brother', 'reason', 'sister', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'Wonder', 'why', 'one', 'more', 'person', 'may', 'recognize', 'also', 'amazingly', 'young', 'forget', 'how', 'long', 'ago', '1946', 'really', 'see', 'changes', 'Chill', 'Wills', 'Leick', 'Thorne', 'Dick', 'old', 'friend', 'caretaker', 'lakeside', 'cottage', 'Back', 'Moon', 'Real', 'young', 'real', 'recognizable', 'face', 'voice.A', 'good', 'movie', 'possibly', 'even', 'very', 'good', 'only', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'was', 'that', 'said', 'plot', 'was', 'more', 'predictable', 'suspenseful', 'preview', 'seemed', 'suggest', 'paste-together', 'several', 'books', 'movies', 'past', 'Still', 'old', 'enough', 'perhaps', 'story', 'came', 'first', 'least', 'book', 'form']",N/A

Unfortunately, she is lacking some things internally. Ellen has no conscience. She also lacks compassion, empathy, and a few other human qualities.

She wants him, but wait, she's already engaged to be married to another man (Vincent Price). No problem! In Ellen's mind, all she needs to do is remove her engagement ring and move on. She'll marry the writer now. This comes as quite a shock to both men involved. This is just the way Ellen thinks and lives her life. No one else matters. They are all mere pawns to help her get her own satisfaction. Sometimes these pawns get in her way, as if they were of some importance. Ellen must find a way to deal w/ such naughty ""people"".

The actors are wooden and lifeless, especially Cornel Wilde.  There is no reason to believe that Tierney's character would be so insanely jealous of him.

Fairbanks""","[6, 9]","The title, ""Leave Her to Heaven,"" could mean anything, and the cover of Fox's video release suggests it's a sweet romance. Gene Tierney and Cornel Wilde are embracing, and the gorgeous Tierney, dressed in a silky pink top, is gazing upon Wilde with a look that suggests lust. Yes, ""Leave Her to Heaven"" must be a romance, one whose title refers to a girl so darned wonderful only an angel could successfully woo her.Guess again. The title comes from Shakespeare's ""Hamlet,"" and despite ""Leave Her to Heaven""'s lush Technicolor cinematography (which won an Oscar), this is a dark tale of obsession worthy of Alfred Hitchcock. The Jo Swerling screenplay would have been better served by the legendary ""Master of Suspense,"" but even the less heralded John M. Stahl manages to put most of this story's potential on the screen.Tierney is Ellen, a woman engaged to marry an ambitious politician (Vincent Price), but who surrenders to her wandering eye before she makes it to the altar. She dumps the politico for Richard (Cornel Wilde) whom she proposes to only days after they meet. They marry, but Richard soon finds himself trapped in a relationship that leaves no room in his life for anyone but the jealous Ellen who even sees Richard's teenaged brother as a rival.Ellen's obsession with Richard, and her hatred for everyone that comes between them, takes several bizarre turns, and the film's most memorable sequence is a macabre masterpiece.With the exception of Tierney, the cast is strictly average. Cornel Wilde is his usual dull self, and Vincent Price, sans mustache, is wimpy and inconsequential. Jeanne Crain is good as Ellen's sister, and Darryl Hickman is typical of the young performers of the `40s, which is to say he's a trifle annoying. But Tierney, in an Oscar nominated role, rises above her co-stars with a brilliant portrayal of a cold, calculating woman whose beauty, alas, is only skin deep. With skin that stunning, however, it's understandable that she has everyone fooled.Brian W.

Gene Tierney, Cornel Wilde and Jeanne Crain lead the strong, well-acted cast and the Technicolor photography beautifully enhances and heightens the on-screen drama of the piece.An encounter in  a train bound for New Mexico throws together beautiful Ellen Berent (Gene Tierney) and thoughtful author Richard Harland (Cornel Wilde).  Pretty soon, Ellen has Richard wound around her finger and despite the fact that she's already engaged to attorney Russell Quinton (Vincent Price), they get married.Soon however, Ellen's true nature starts to manifest.  She cannot stand anything (or anyone) distracting Richard's love and attention toward her, so she must destroy anything in her path.  Only Ellen's mother and sister (Mary Philips and Jeanne Crain) know of the real Ellen, and it's only a matter of time before Richard comes to know her as well...This remains an engrossing and highly-entertaining movie, chiefly because of Gene Tierney who completely throws herself into the role of monstrous Ellen (not to mention the Technicolor photography which immeasurably adds to her considerable beauty; this is probably her greatest screen appearance).  Cornel Wilde (and his charming screen persona) is perfect for the gentle Richard and Jeanne Crain really could pass for Tierney's sister.  Darryl Hickman plays Richard's disabled brother Danny.

Leave Her To Heaven has 20th Century Fox stamped all over it. As a product of post WWII, this film was shot in technicolor that at times can be jarring in terms of the actresses makeup and ruby red lips. However, it is also lush in terms of the exterior scenes which provide a romantic and expansive setting as a backdrop to love, fury, and even murder.The story is about a chance meeting of an author named Richard and a well placed Bostonian woman named Ellen. Their chance meeting on a train is only a prelude to what will become a love that is tinged in jealousy and violence as it becomes rapidly apparent that Ellen does not love in half measures and hers is an all consuming love that cannot include anything but the man she loves. In return, Ellen demands the same with no deviation.Seductive and unbelievably sneaky, Ellen snags Richard and then goes nuts when she comes to the full realization that Richard's polio stricken brother is part of a package deal whom she can't pack off to school or to her mother and stepsister in Boston. What is Ellen to do? Get rid of the competition. She prods Danny into an endurance swim at their summer home in Canada on a lake. The place is called Back of the Moon. For Danny, it is his end of the day as Ellen watches as he goes under once, and then twice, pleading for help. One might  think that this might be the end of all the jealousy, but Ellen gets pregnant. She also doesn't like the close friendship between Richard and her stepsister Ruth. As Ellen's irrational anger grows and becomes less controlled, so do her external actions. What comes next is the continuation of a story that continues to build until it reaches a boiling point where all the participants are unwillingly and without their knowledge are sucked into Ellen's master plan.The unbelievably lovely Gene Tierney plays Ellen with a determination that is steely and chilling and contrasts beautifully with the empathetic and caring mask she wears publicly. Cornell Wilde does a good job as the lovestruck Richard who seems too blinded by love to understand what is really happening through most of the film. Jeanne Crain is Ruth, who is innocent but understands completely that there are two distinct sides to Ellen and that she is a force to be dealt with. Vincent Price makes an appearance as Ellen's ex-fiancee who is out for blood and performs some courtroom drama as a prosecuting attorney. Young Darryl Hickman plays Danny who is unfailingly trusting like a lamb bring lead to his slaughter.This is such a clever movie that is beautifully photographed and acted that it qualifies as a must see 66 years after it was made.

Color films from early post-WWII era are rarely found, so it was a great pleasure to just enjoy the outdoor scenes and elaborate interior shots.  Each of the four outdoor locations selected for the movie are stunning.The story is about a nationally known fiction author (played by Cornel Wilde) who meets a woman (played by Gene Tierney) on a train, both on their way to the same resort in rural New Mexico.  They have a whirlwind romance, get married, and then serious problems surface.  Without giving away too many details of what happens next, it becomes obvious that one of the characters is psychologically unstable as a series of tragic events occur.  The script itself is overall very good, but it loses a little momentum towards the very end, but I still give it a strong recommendation.  To me it seemed more like a melodrama than a noir film.The DVD transfer approaches superb.  The color is vivid and the picture quality seems adequately sharp for a color film from that era.

The breathtaking color cinematography (which won an oscar) has never looked so awesome, and virtually all age-related flaws with the original print have been fixed.Gene Tierney plays Ellen, a stunningly beautiful woman who marries a famous writer, Richard Harland (played by Cornel Wilde). Ellen loves her husband so intensely that she'll let nothing and no one destract Richard from her. Richard soon realizes that something is very wrong with his wife, but when he asks Ellen's mother, he gets the naive reply,""There's nothing wrong with Ellen. It's just that she loves too much."" Talk about the understatement of the year!Richard's younger brother, Danny, is crippled and craves attention from him almost as much as Ellen. When Ellen can't get rid of him peacefully, she ""accidentally"" lets Danny drown while watching calmly from a nearby boat, in one of the most chilling scenes from any film noir ever made! But even with Danny out of the picture, Ellen sees that her nice step-sister (played by the lovely Jeanne Crain) is getting more and more attention from Richard. Richard is also becoming more and more detatched from his devoted wife.Eventually, Richard learns the full truth about his sinister, selfish wife, but when he finally leaves her, she proves to have one last evil trick up her sleeve. To reveal any more would spoil the ending, but I can assure you that the movie ends great and is a real gem from the golden years of film noir.

370686,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,6303364772,Douglas M,"[4, 10]","As you read all the reviews, you can see the mixed reactions this film gets.  It is an unusual melodrama filmed in glorious technicolour, but it lacks pace and is strangely unconvincing.  It is too drawn out and unsubtle. John Stahl directs at a plod.Gene Tierney plays a woman who is obsessed with the memory of her father.  She ditches her fiance, Vincent Price, and marries Cornel Wilde because of his resemblance to her father and then eliminates anyone who she feels would distract Wilde from her. She lets his disabled brother Danny, played in a cloying manner by Darryl Hickman, drown, aborts her own baby and finally takes poison, leaving an incriminating letter to ensure sister Jeanne Crain and Wilde are sentenced for murder.Tierney is controversial in the lead.  She acts with a mask-like countenance which reflects her character's deceit but she comes across rather like a zombie than a real person. Every thought is telegraphed to the audience, rather like silent screen acting. It may be the director's fault but, is it great acting?  I'm not sure. Some reviewers when the film was released panned her performance; one comment was that it was ""as analytical as a dot on the letter i"" and that may be right.  You certainly can't take your eyes off her but that may be simply her extraordinary beauty.  She was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar which certainly is a sign that someone found her performance convincing!All the rest of the leading players are colourless. Wilde projects a nice ordinary guy caught in a web beyond his comprehension but he is so lacking in personality that the character comes over as one dimensional. Jeanne Crain's role is thankless but she is rather appealing.  Vincent Price overacts, particularly in the court room scenes. The best acting is by the supports such as Ray Collins and Mary Phillips who at least project real people.The DVD package contains a near perfect print and includes a commentary split between Richard Schickel and Darryl Hickman.  The commentaries are completely seperate and have been edited to flick back and forth between the two. This does not make for easy listening. Schickel's contribution is his usual dreary but informative dissertation but Hickman's input is mainly recollections of being a child star - not really a ""commentary"" at all. He does speak of the film as a transition to maturity because up until then, he had always had helpful directors and co-stars. Not so here, when Stahl bullied him and offered no assistance. His observations concerning the acting of the principals and the direction, however, are interesting, particularly the remoteness of Tierney and her inability to interact with her fellow players on and off screen. This film was made not long after the birth of her severely retarded child and her withdrawal from social intercourse and focus on her role sounds logical given the personal tragedy with which she was dealing.A few other extras are included including a trailer which promotes Tierney as a great dramatic actress, some stills and footage of the film's gala premiere. The film is worth seeing as a fruity melodrama and a perfect example of exemplary studio film making, but it is not film noir nor really a timeless classic. It should be noted that the film was an enormous hit in its day.",3,Old fashioned melodrama dressed up in technicolour,1139097600,"02 5, 2006",2006,3309,"['read', 'reviews', 'can', 'see', 'mixed', 'reactions', 'film', 'unusual', 'melodrama', 'filmed', 'glorious', 'technicolour', 'pace', 'strangely', 'unconvincing', 'too', 'drawn', 'out', 'unsubtle', 'John', 'Stahl', 'plod.Gene', 'Tierney', 'woman', 'who', 'obsessed', 'memory', 'father', 'fiance', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'marries', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'resemblance', 'father', 'then', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'distract', 'Wilde', 'disabled', 'brother', 'Danny', 'played', 'cloying', 'manner', 'Darryl', 'Hickman', 'drown', 'own', 'baby', 'finally', 'poison', 'leaving', 'incriminating', 'letter', 'ensure', 'sister', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'Wilde', 'are', 'sentenced', 'murder.Tierney', 'controversial', 'lead', 'mask-like', 'countenance', 'character', 'deceit', 'rather', 'zombie', 'real', 'person', 'thought', 'telegraphed', 'audience', 'rather', 'silent', 'screen', 'acting', 'may', 'be', 'director', 'fault', 'great', 'acting', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'reviewers', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'panned', 'performance', 'one', 'comment', 'was', 'was', 'as', 'analytical', 'dot', 'letter', 'i', 'may', 'be', 'right', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'may', 'be', 'simply', 'extraordinary', 'beauty', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'certainly', 'sign', 'someone', 'found', 'performance', 'convincing', 'rest', 'leading', 'players', 'are', 'colourless', 'Wilde', 'projects', 'nice', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'caught', 'web', 'comprehension', 'so', 'lacking', 'personality', 'character', 'over', 'one', 'dimensional', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'role', 'thankless', 'rather', 'appealing', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'overacts', 'particularly', 'court', 'room', 'scenes', 'best', 'acting', 'supports', 'such', 'Ray', 'Collins', 'Mary', 'Phillips', 'who', 'least', 'project', 'real', 'people.The', 'DVD', 'package', 'near', 'perfect', 'print', 'commentary', 'split', 'Richard', 'Schickel', 'Darryl', 'Hickman', 'commentaries', 'are', 'completely', 'seperate', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'flick', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'not', 'make', 'easy', 'listening', 'Schickel', 'contribution', 'usual', 'dreary', 'informative', 'dissertation', 'Hickman', 'input', 'mainly', 'recollections', 'being', 'child', 'star', 'not', 'really', 'commentary', 'speak', 'film', 'transition', 'maturity', 'then', 'had', 'always', 'had', 'helpful', 'directors', 'co-stars', 'Not', 'so', 'here', 'when', 'Stahl', 'bullied', 'offered', 'assistance', 'observations', 'concerning', 'acting', 'principals', 'direction', 'however', 'are', 'interesting', 'particularly', 'remoteness', 'Tierney', 'inability', 'interact', 'fellow', 'players', 'screen', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'not', 'long', 'birth', 'severely', 'retarded', 'child', 'withdrawal', 'social', 'intercourse', 'focus', 'role', 'logical', 'given', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'was', 'dealing.A', 'few', 'other', 'extras', 'are', 'included', 'including', 'trailer', 'Tierney', 'great', 'dramatic', 'actress', 'stills', 'footage', 'film', 'gala', 'premiere', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'fruity', 'melodrama', 'perfect', 'example', 'exemplary', 'studio', 'film', 'making', 'not', 'film', 'noir', 'really', 'timeless', 'classic', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'film', 'was', 'enormous', 'hit', 'day']",N/A

Leave Her to Heaven was a big hit, and took home some hardware at the 1946 Oscars as proof, although I think at times it suffers from being a little too dreamy. Still, the scenery is breathtaking and picturesque and the mood is excellent and effective, and the actors perform adequately in their roles.While I don't think this is as great of performance as her role in The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, it is unique to see Tierney changing it up and playing the villain, Ellen Berent Harland. She has a quiet, vindictive way about her, as her visions of perfect marriage are ruffled up a bit with visits from family and in-laws and Richard's time-consuming job as an author. She has to have things her way, or it might get a little unpleasant for others, although quite a bit of time passes before we see her true side. She takes matters in her own hands, including an eerie scene with her out in the lake with Richard's nephew Danny. As other reviewers have said, this is a scene that defines her coldness and callousness. Before other possessive unbalanced females graced the screen in films such as Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct, there was Ellen Berent.The film also provides some memorable, unforgettable lines. I love the one with Ellen and her sister Ruth after Ellen's true colors have been revealed. Ellen is attempting to antagonize and bully good girl Ruth, and Ruth's response: ""I don't envy you--I'm sorry for you. You're the most pitiful creature I've ever known."" There is also a dramatic trial at the end of the film. While the trial seems a bit over-the-top and ridiculous at points, Vincent Price, a lawyer who stars as Ellen's former love, provides fantastic tension toward the film's conclusion, as several key stars take the stand.The disc also has an optional commentary from the director, as well as a quick look into the 1946 Oscars.",4,"""It's just that she loves too much""",1309824000,"07 5, 2011",2011,2060,"['Gene', 'Tierney', 'golden', 'girl', 'image', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'where', 'unstable', 'very', 'possessive', 'woman', 'who', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Richard', 'Harland', 'soon', 'discovers', 'marrying', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'was', 'big', 'hit', 'took', 'home', 'hardware', '1946', 'Oscars', 'proof', 'think', 'times', 'being', 'little', 'too', 'dreamy', 'Still', 'scenery', 'breathtaking', 'picturesque', 'mood', 'excellent', 'effective', 'actors', 'perform', 'adequately', 'roles.While', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'as', 'great', 'performance', 'role', 'Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'unique', 'see', 'Tierney', 'changing', 'playing', 'villain', 'Ellen', 'Berent', 'Harland', 'quiet', 'vindictive', 'way', 'visions', 'perfect', 'marriage', 'are', 'ruffled', 'up', 'bit', 'visits', 'family', 'in-laws', 'Richard', 'time-consuming', 'job', 'author', 'have', 'things', 'way', 'might', 'get', 'little', 'unpleasant', 'others', 'quite', 'bit', 'time', 'passes', 'see', 'true', 'side', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'including', 'eerie', 'scene', 'out', 'lake', 'Richard', 'nephew', 'Danny', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'scene', 'coldness', 'callousness', 'other', 'possessive', 'unbalanced', 'females', 'graced', 'screen', 'films', 'such', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'was', 'Ellen', 'Berent.The', 'film', 'also', 'memorable', 'unforgettable', 'lines', 'love', 'one', 'Ellen', 'sister', 'Ruth', 'Ellen', 'true', 'colors', 'have', 'been', 'revealed', 'Ellen', 'attempting', 'antagonize', 'bully', 'good', 'girl', 'Ruth', 'Ruth', 'response', 'do', ""n't"", 'envy', ""'m"", 'sorry', ""'re"", 'most', 'pitiful', 'creature', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'known', 'also', 'dramatic', 'trial', 'end', 'film', 'trial', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'ridiculous', 'points', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'lawyer', 'who', 'Ellen', 'former', 'love', 'fantastic', 'tension', 'film', 'conclusion', 'several', 'key', 'stars', 'take', 'stand.The', 'disc', 'also', 'optional', 'commentary', 'director', 'as', 'well', 'quick', 'look', '1946', 'Oscars']",N/A

Taylor ""GFT""","[30, 43]","Although a few ""prestige"" actresses (Bette Davis among them) continued to play ""vixen"" roles, during WWII most of Hollywood's leading ladies were presented as the sort of woman a solider could dream about: whether bouncy like Betty Hutton or glamorous like Joan Crawford, they were good-hearted, dependable, and waiting for the boys to come home.  Then in 1945 one of Hollywood's most beautiful leading ladies played a role that undercut the girl next door with an ax, and after that nothing would be quite the same.Seen within the context of its times, it is easy to understand why LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN was one of the great shockers of its day.  Based on a popular novel by Ben Ames Williams, the film tells the story of Ellen Berent, a woman who seems absolutely flawless in every way imaginable: she is beautiful, intelligent, and of good social background.  But she is also a psychopath who marries novelist Richard Harland (Corniel Wilde) because he looks a bit like her dead father, to whom she had an obsessive attachment--and once married she determines to have him completely to herself, even if that means destroying any one with the slightest claim on his affections.Seen today, LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN has a clunky feel to it: the script has all the nuance of a wrecking ball in full swing.  But the film still fascinates by virtue of the visual beauty (it won an Oscar for color cinematography) that overlays its very direct story of darkest evil, with Gene Tierney's performance as Ellen the pivotal point.  Tierney was never more breath-takingly beautiful, and although her performance lacks nuance it is surprisingly powerful in its simplicity.  While we might dismiss the film in comparison to such recent and similar shockers as FATAL ATTRACTION, it is impossible to dismiss the vision of such physical loveliness as a mask for darkest evil; the scene in which she allows a child to drown, for example, is justly famous, simply filmed in a beautiful setting in full day light, with Tierney's beautiful face suddenly mask-like, implacable.

She was also an underrated actress, who played &quot;good&quot; girls in films such as &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;, &quot;Laura&quot;, &quot;The Ghost and Mrs Muir&quot;,  and &quot;Dragonwyck&quot;,and bitches in films such as &quot;The Razor's Edge&quot;, &quot;The Egyptian&quot;, and, of course, &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; a technicolor &quot;film noir&quot;. In this, her Oscar-nominated role, she plays Ellen Berent, a woman whose insane jealousy and possessiveness causes misery and death to those around her. She sets her eyes on writer Richard Harland, (Cornel Wilde) who reminds her of her late father. Ellen had an unusual, almost incestuous relationship with her father-one even suspects that she drove him to his death. Having jilted her district attorney fiancee Russell Quentin, played by Vincent Price, she sets out to hook Harland. It seems that Ellen doesn't want to share her husband's affections with anyone, including his crippled kid brother, whom she lets drown when he attempts to swim across a lake, and her unborn child, when she deliberately throws herself down a flight of stairs to induce a miscarriage. When Ellen's jealousy of her sister's relationship and budding affection for her husband, along with his discovery of the truth of his brother's and unborn child's deaths force him to leave her in disgust, she plots the ultimate act of vindictiveness-she fatally poisons herself, and sends a letter implicating her sister and husband to her ex-fiancee Quentin. This doll didn't play! Miss Tierney, who had suffered a nervous breakdown in the 1950s after a series of unfortunate incidents in her personal life, wrote in her book &quot;Self Portrait&quot;, that the character she played in this film was insane-and that she tried very hard,and convincingly, to make others think that she was not. Miss Tierney's performance is very believable, restrained, and positively chilling. The Technicolor photography, while beautiful, has a certain &quot;chilliness&quot; which actually heightens the film's drama-a rather unusual twist, as this type of fare was usually filmed in black and white. Add to this a powerful, chilling score by Alfred Newman, good performances by Wilde, Price, the lovely Jeanne Crain, and Darryl Hickman, and you have an entertaining, slickly produced melodrama. Yes, jealousy is one of the seven deadly sins-and in this film, it is &quot;deadlier than the male&quot;!",5,If looks could kill...,990576000,"05 23, 2001",2001,2606,"['Gene', 'Tierney', 'beautiful', 'cheekbones', 'creamy', 'skin', 'icy', 'blue', 'eyes', 'delicious', 'overbite', 'chestnut', 'hair', 'was', 'vision', 'loveliness-one', 'great', 'beauties', 'screen', 'was', 'also', 'underrated', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'quot', 'good', 'quot', 'girls', 'films', 'such', 'quot', 'Heaven', 'Can', 'Wait', 'quot', 'quot', 'Laura', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'Mrs', 'Muir', 'quot', 'quot', 'Dragonwyck', 'quot', 'bitches', 'films', 'such', 'quot', 'Razor', 'Edge', 'quot', 'quot', 'Egyptian', 'quot', 'course', 'quot', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'quot', 'technicolor', 'quot', 'film', 'noir', 'quot', 'Oscar-nominated', 'role', 'Ellen', 'Berent', 'woman', 'insane', 'jealousy', 'possessiveness', 'causes', 'misery', 'death', 'eyes', 'writer', 'Richard', 'Harland', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'who', 'late', 'father', 'Ellen', 'had', 'unusual', 'almost', 'incestuous', 'relationship', 'father-one', 'even', 'suspects', 'drove', 'death', 'Having', 'jilted', 'district', 'attorney', 'fiancee', 'Russell', 'Quentin', 'played', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'out', 'hook', 'Harland', 'Ellen', ""n't"", 'want', 'share', 'husband', 'affections', 'anyone', 'including', 'crippled', 'kid', 'brother', 'whom', 'drown', 'when', 'swim', 'lake', 'unborn', 'child', 'when', 'deliberately', 'down', 'flight', 'stairs', 'induce', 'miscarriage', 'When', 'Ellen', 'jealousy', 'sister', 'relationship', 'budding', 'affection', 'husband', 'discovery', 'truth', 'brother', 'unborn', 'child', 'deaths', 'force', 'leave', 'disgust', 'plots', 'ultimate', 'act', 'vindictiveness-she', 'fatally', 'poisons', 'letter', 'implicating', 'sister', 'husband', 'ex-fiancee', 'Quentin', 'doll', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'Miss', 'Tierney', 'who', 'had', 'suffered', 'nervous', 'breakdown', '1950s', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'incidents', 'personal', 'life', 'wrote', 'book', 'quot', 'Self', 'Portrait', 'quot', 'character', 'played', 'film', 'was', 'insane-and', 'tried', 'very', 'hard', 'convincingly', 'make', 'others', 'think', 'was', 'not', 'Miss', 'Tierney', 'performance', 'very', 'believable', 'restrained', 'positively', 'chilling', 'Technicolor', 'photography', 'beautiful', 'certain', 'quot', 'chilliness', 'quot', 'actually', 'film', 'drama-a', 'rather', 'unusual', 'twist', 'type', 'fare', 'was', 'usually', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'Add', 'powerful', 'chilling', 'score', 'Alfred', 'Newman', 'good', 'performances', 'Wilde', 'Price', 'lovely', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'Darryl', 'Hickman', 'have', 'entertaining', 'slickly', 'produced', 'melodrama', 'Yes', 'jealousy', 'one', 'seven', 'deadly', 'sins-and', 'film', 'quot', 'deadlier', 'male', 'quot']",N/A

Kara Russell ""Actress/Artist/Musician/Writer""","[4, 4]","I saw this movie a long time ago on television, and have always remembered it; not only for it's visual beauty, which is great, but for the fascinating story.Unusual for it's day is the very slow progression of Gene Tierny's character - an element of the writing that holds up well over the years.  While in her introduction she seems a bit odd, the moment passes, and she appears to be the ""perfect 40s woman"" in every respect.  It is only through time that we see other aspects of her personality, and... isn't that how life is!Vincent Price turns in a beautiful performance, except for the courtroom scene where the dialogue (not his fault) is WAY over the top.  This is a melodrama, and the second half of the film reminds us of it.The DVD  commentary includes the child star that played the younger brother with polio.  He's not very kind to Gene Tierney, but to sounds as if she wasn't very kind to him, either.  Ironically, while he faults her acting, it seems that she may actually have been using a ""method"" technique; being detached and cold off screen as well as on.  Certainly, she gives a very superficial performance, but it works; especially as played against Jeanne Crain as her sympathetic adopted sister.More than anything, this movie is lovely to look at.  The cinematography is lovely; the locations, and color all beautiful.  Being a ""woman's film"" the costumes are fantastic.  This film is a perfect study for women's clothing of the era; especially as the characters as so delineated in their manner of dress.  This was obviously a big budget movie, and it was masterfully done in all these technical aspects.If you are a film buff, it is worth many viewings.(additional note June 2009) - I have found over the years that this is one of my three most watched DVDs.  It is not so much the story itself as the overall production that makes this emminently re-watchable.  It has the glorious color, varied beautiful locations, interesting architecture, and over time, one appreciates how rich in detail this production is.  ex: Jeanne Crain's character is playing a Chopin Nocturne by memory in an early scene.  Not only does it set a mood, it tells us about the character -that she is intelligent, talented, and the ability to focus and work - we can see that she is beautiful.  But this is such a subtle detail... the film is filled with this kind of detail, a ""thriller/courtroom"" elelment, and has all the surface beauty of a regular melodrama.

370703,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,6303364772,J. Michael Click,"[97, 99]","Movie: *****  DVD Transfer: *****  Extras: *****20th Century-Fox's highest-grossing film of the 1940's showcases exquisite leading lady Gene Tierney in a mesmerizing, Oscar-nominated performance as a femme fatale whose placid beauty masks a murderously possessive heart.  Based on the best-selling novel by Ben Ames Williams, the astonishingly perverse screenplay by Jo Swerling touches on such then-taboo (and still-shocking) subjects as incestuous obsession, the victimization of the disabled, self-induced abortion, and suicide disguised as homicide!  Pretty potent stuff for its time, and it's all presented in lush candy-box Technicolor by Oscar-winner Leon Shamroy, whose masterful cinematography skillfully emphasizes a central theme of the film: that a beautiful surface can sometimes hide a thoroughly rotten core.By design and through her acting skills, Miss Tierney's tour de force performance dominates the film; she especially shines in two challenging sequences, one involving a rowboat and another which takes place on a staircase.  Among the supporting cast, solid work is turned in by Cornel Wilde as the object of Tierney's intensity; Jeanne Crain as her sweet-natured cousin and adopted sister; and Mary Philips as her alienated mother; but it is Vincent Price who stands out in a bravura performance as Tierney's former suitor.  Price's character takes center stage throughout the final twenty minutes of the movie, and he plays some very long and difficult scenes with aplomb.Fox Home Video's DVD presentation of this classic drama is truly impeccable, featuring a gorgeous, digitally restored print and remastered soundtrack.  I've seen this movie dozens times over the past thirty years - in theatres, on video, and on cable - and it's never looked or sounded so magnificent.  The bonus features include the film's 1952 Theatrical Re-release Trailer; Fox Movietone News segments featuring footage of the film's Los Angeles premiere and the 1945 Academy Awards; a fascinating stills gallery featuring photos taken during the film's location shooting at Bass Lake; and a restoration comparison demonstrating how the film was remastered for DVD.  The disc  also features an audio commentary by film critic Richard Schickel, who clearly was unprepared for the job: he refers to Price's  character by the wrong name; mistakenly identifies two child players as boys (one, played by Betty Hannon, is obviously a girl); and vacillates back and forth in his opinions regarding the film's qualities.  Additional commentary is also offered by actor Darryl Hickman, who played Cornel Wilde's brother in the film.  Hickman clearly loathed making the movie, and snipes ungraciously about Tierney as an actress and as a human being, ignoring the fact that she was struggling with the devastating prospect of institutionalizing her mentally enfeebled 18-month-old daughter during the course of the film's production.  Hickman also takes potshots at Jeanne Crain (appearing in her fifth film role of any size), director John M. Stahl, and the personality of cameraman Leon Shamroy (although he is clearly an admirer of the latter's work).  The sour and ineffective commentary aside, the DVD presentation of ""Leave Her to Heaven"" is a superb example of 1940's Hollywood moviemaking and the DVD format at their very best, and is most highly recommended for your viewing pleasure.",5,"""What's Wrong With Ellen?"" ...",1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,3383,"['Movie', '*****', 'DVD', 'Transfer', '*****', 'Extras', '*****20th', 'Century-Fox', 'highest-grossing', 'film', '1940', 'showcases', 'exquisite', 'leading', 'lady', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'mesmerizing', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'femme', 'fatale', 'placid', 'beauty', 'murderously', 'possessive', 'heart', 'Based', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'Ben', 'Ames', 'Williams', 'astonishingly', 'perverse', 'screenplay', 'Jo', 'Swerling', 'touches', 'such', 'then-taboo', 'still-shocking', 'incestuous', 'obsession', 'victimization', 'disabled', 'self-induced', 'abortion', 'suicide', 'disguised', 'homicide', 'Pretty', 'potent', 'stuff', 'time', 'presented', 'lush', 'candy-box', 'Technicolor', 'Oscar-winner', 'Leon', 'Shamroy', 'masterful', 'cinematography', 'skillfully', 'central', 'theme', 'film', 'beautiful', 'surface', 'can', 'sometimes', 'hide', 'thoroughly', 'rotten', 'core.By', 'design', 'acting', 'skills', 'Miss', 'Tierney', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'film', 'especially', 'shines', 'two', 'challenging', 'sequences', 'one', 'involving', 'rowboat', 'place', 'staircase', 'supporting', 'cast', 'solid', 'work', 'turned', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'object', 'Tierney', 'intensity', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'sweet-natured', 'cousin', 'adopted', 'sister', 'Mary', 'Philips', 'alienated', 'mother', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'who', 'out', 'bravura', 'performance', 'Tierney', 'former', 'suitor', 'Price', 'character', 'center', 'stage', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'very', 'long', 'difficult', 'scenes', 'aplomb.Fox', 'Home', 'Video', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'classic', 'drama', 'truly', 'impeccable', 'featuring', 'gorgeous', 'digitally', 'restored', 'print', 'remastered', 'soundtrack', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'times', 'past', 'thirty', 'years', 'theatres', 'video', 'cable', 'never', 'looked', 'sounded', 'so', 'magnificent', 'bonus', 'include', 'film', '1952', 'Theatrical', 'Re-release', 'Trailer', 'Fox', 'Movietone', 'News', 'segments', 'featuring', 'footage', 'film', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'premiere', '1945', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'fascinating', 'stills', 'gallery', 'featuring', 'photos', 'taken', 'film', 'location', 'shooting', 'Bass', 'Lake', 'restoration', 'comparison', 'demonstrating', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'remastered', 'DVD', 'disc', 'also', 'audio', 'commentary', 'film', 'critic', 'Richard', 'Schickel', 'who', 'clearly', 'was', 'unprepared', 'job', 'Price', 'character', 'wrong', 'name', 'mistakenly', 'two', 'child', 'players', 'boys', 'one', 'played', 'Betty', 'Hannon', 'obviously', 'girl', 'back', 'forth', 'opinions', 'regarding', 'film', 'qualities', 'Additional', 'commentary', 'also', 'offered', 'actor', 'Darryl', 'Hickman', 'who', 'played', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'brother', 'film', 'Hickman', 'clearly', 'loathed', 'making', 'movie', 'ungraciously', 'about', 'Tierney', 'actress', 'human', 'being', 'ignoring', 'fact', 'was', 'struggling', 'devastating', 'prospect', 'institutionalizing', 'mentally', 'enfeebled', '18-month-old', 'daughter', 'course', 'film', 'production', 'Hickman', 'also', 'potshots', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'appearing', 'fifth', 'film', 'role', 'size', 'director', 'John', 'M.', 'Stahl', 'personality', 'cameraman', 'Leon', 'Shamroy', 'clearly', 'admirer', 'latter', 'work', 'sour', 'ineffective', 'commentary', 'aside', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'superb', 'example', '1940', 'Hollywood', 'moviemaking', 'DVD', 'format', 'very', 'best', 'most', 'highly', 'recommended', 'viewing', 'pleasure']",N/A

Extraordinary technicolor and Gene Tierney is wonderful, a walking goddess until her closeups when you see she is insane. This is Hollywood studio dark fantasy and yes Bunuel must have loved it. If only he'd had this budget. The Amazon blurb is inaccurately dismissive in my opinion.The commentary, by critic Schickel and the child actor who grew up to be an acting coach, is to be avoided. There are some technical details that are interesting but then they launch into a 1950s Method-adoring attack on Tierney (who was rude to the supporting cast apparently) with 'Bobby' carrying on as if she were a bad student in front of him in class. Whatever she did to get this performance works if you are an audience for it, she is better by miles than Wilde or her critic, who says he didn't like the role because he was physically fit and the role was a cripple - no wonder he doesn't work now. Tierney extended herself in the role and is the major reason it's so good. Though highly artificial in style, the attitudes of the family - refusing to state the obvious - and the dialogue is exactly how an upper-middle-class family of that time thought and spoke and many still do today. Brando in Wilde's role would have destroyed the film. You want a Method lecture read up on Strasberg, but don't let the commentary ruin what is a highly accomplished film. Tierney's entire performance is keyed to one line reading and that is high level stuff apparently beyond the commentators' ability to appreciate.

However, jealousy is rottenness to the bones -- particularly when its ugliness is directed toward family who wish to share the affection of a compulsive bride's new prize. Anti-social behavior and compulsive personality disorder are taken to their highest levels of obsession in Gene Tierney's greatest role. (She arguably outdoes her performance inLAURA!)

There's a scene in a railroad car between Cornel Wilde and Gene Tierney that looks 3-D, and that's no jive.However, the movie itself is what we used to call in grade school, nasty. Gene Tierney plays an amoral woman who will stop at nothing--and it just gets worse and worse--to keep Cornel Wilde all to herself. The other reviewers have characterized her as psychopathic, and she must be, to be so obsessed with Cornel Wilde of all people! He doesn't really do anything to deserve all this attention from her, except for a tell-tale detail: he resembles her late father, whose ashes Gene spreads all over New Mexico while bouncing somewhat suggestively on her horse. So there's this ever-so-slight suggestion of incest at the beginning of the movie, although we never really go much more into it.Still, campy cult film that it is, I enjoyed this movie until she went out on the lake with Corne's crippled brother--that's the nasty part, I'm afraid. She encourages him to swim beyond his endurance and lets him drown in front of her. Now, although she goes on to do some other awful things throughout the movie, this one scene was too upsetting for me, reminding me of the scene in the original &quot;Frankenstein&quot; between the monster and the little girl he kills. It's too discordant, frankly; while the rest of the movie is kind of absurd in its campiness, this is something very different, very sadistic. In fact, because of that one scene, I can never really recommend this movie to my friends, although I wistfully mention the wonderful photography.

But when she meets and marries a writer (Cornel Wilde), she's got big obstacles to overcome to keep him to herself. One of these being an invalid kid brother. Shot in wonderful Technicolor with on location shots, the film is magnificent to look at capturing marvelous detail and depth.

370719,AUFK6UT2DU87H,6303364772,"Meredith L. Burton ""Bookworm""","[1, 2]","""Leave Her to Heaven"" is a compelling movie I came across when perusing Netflix.  This movie is based upon a novel of the same name and had me spellbound from start to finish.Writer Richard Harland is traveling on a train when he meets Ellen Berrant.  She is a lovely woman who immediately captures his heart.  For her part, Ellen is immediately infatuated by Richard.  He bears a striking resemblance to her deceased father, and she is intrigued by his impulsive nature: a nature that, in some ways, mirrors her own.  After a whirlwind courtship, Richard and Ellen are married.  Soon, all that Richard holds dear is in danger.  Could the childlike, possessive, yet beautifully seductive Ellen be the source behind the mysterious happenings?I found this movie to be very disturbing and unforgettable.  Jean Tierney is chilling as Ellen.  Her voice is so soothing, and her demeanor is so charming, yet she will do anything to have the one she loves all to herself.  As Ellen's own mother states: ""Ellen loves too much"".  Ellen is a character who is the true personification of evil, yet she is strangely sympathetic.The most riveting scene of the film occurs on a picturesque lake on a sunny afternoon.  Ellen impassively watches Richard's disabled younger brother drown, and we as viewers are repulsed yet simultaneously mesmerized.  The scene is nightmare-inducing.  Often, the most chilling acts of violence do not involve bloodshed.Jeanne Crane does excellent work as Ellen's adopted sister, Ruth.  Her character provides relief and a direct contrast to her sister's monstrous personality.Please watch this movie to experience a true gem of psychological terror.  You will not be disappointed.

370721,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,6303364772,mirasreviews,"[15, 15]","""Leave Her to Heaven "" is often considered to be the only color film noir of the classic era. Its bright, oversaturated Technicolor does belie the film's themes, but ""Leave Her to Heaven"" is more dark melodrama than film noir. The story is grounded in emotions, not ambition; love, not sex; culpability, not cynicism. The film is based on the novel by Ben Ames Williams and directed by John M. Stahl. Cinematographer Leon Shamroy won an Oscar in 1946 for his wonderful work. In fact, ""Leave Her to Heaven""'s most striking aspect may be its predominant oranges and blues and intricate shadow play. This early Technicolor film stock produced downright garish colors and little texture, but the production design and cinematography are so masterful as to outshine the film stock's limitations.The tale is told in flashback by Glen Robie (Ray Collins), an attorney whose friend and client Richard Harland (Cornel Wilde) has just regained his freedom after spending 2 years in prison. Robie relates the story of Harland's troubles, which started when Harland, a novelist by profession, met his wife: On a train en route to New Mexico, Harland meets a beautiful young woman of privilege named Ellen Berent (Gene Tierney). Immediately taken with Ellen, Harland is elated to find that they will be staying at the same ranch, along with Ellen's family. Ellen is engaged to be married to an ambitious hometown politician, but she favors Richard, so breaks her engagement. They are married after a whirlwind romance and move to Harland's lakeside lodge in Maine, along with Richard's crippled young brother Danny (Darryl Hickman). But Ellen has an all-consuming need to be with her husband and is insanely jealous of any attention he gives anyone or anything else -a need that threatens to consume everyone she touches.Gene Tierney's character is a femme fatale, but not the sort normally associated with film noir. She's sinister and scheming, but driven by impulse and intense emotions, not by ambition. Ellen is the housewife from hell. As her mother says, somewhat optimistically, ""There's nothing wrong with Ellen. She just loves too much."" Ellen is a strong character in spite of the oppressive domestic love that consumes her, smothers every man she attaches herself to, and torments everyone around her. For all of this, Ellen hates children and is rather athletic, so she isn't simply an over-the-top clich&eacute;. She's unbalanced, but she's single-minded to a fault. I don't know if this film will appeal to fans of film noir, because it is simply about the destruction wreaked by one emotionally ill woman. But ""Leave Her to Heaven"" is quite a good film in its own right thanks to a strong script, Gene Tierney's star power, brilliant cinematography, and notable supporting performances by Mary Phillips as Ellen's mother and Vincent Price as her ex-fianc&eacute;.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005 release): Bonus features include a ""Still Gallery"" of on-set photos, 2 ""Hollywood Spotlight"" featurettes of old new reels, a restoration comparison, a theatrical trailer, and an audio commentary. ""Galaxy of Stars Attend World Movie Premiere"" (1 minute) is newsreel footage of the red carpet at the film's 1945 premiere. ""Motion Picture Awards 'Oscar' for Film Achievements"" (1 minute) is footage of Leon Shamroy receiving his Oscar for cinematography at the 1946 Academy Awards. There are newsreels or trailers for 4 other films. ""Restoration Comparison"" (2 minutes) shows side-by-side comparisons of the 1994 film transfer, the 2003 film restoration, and the 2003 DVD for several scenes. The audio commentary is by film critic Richard Schickel and Darryl Hickman, who played Danny in the film when he was 13 years old. These 2 commentaries were recorded separately and put on the same track, which is a little awkward in this case. Schickel talks about actors, story, characters, and a little bit about style. Hickman, who now teaches acting, talks about his career as a child actor, his experiences shooting the film, and the interrelationships between people on the set. He gets gossipy at times, but his commentary includes some interesting observations. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish.

370722,A1FY6ETS4ZPCUE,6303364772,Mr. Mambo,"[1, 1]","I won't bother going over the plot, as others have done so very ably before me. Actually this is more of an ode to Gene Tierney than a review of the film, so....read on if you wish, but don't expect a blow-by-blow accounting/evaluation of each scene. I'd seen it before years ago, and I do have some stream-of-consciousness comments in watching this 1945 film again, on TCM--in HD--two nights ago.Gene Tierney: ah, yes, without a doubt one of the most physically beautiful creatures ever to walk the earth, let alone grace the silver screen. Truly the incarnation of a goddess. There is another very attractive actress in this movie, Jeanne Crain, but to me, on a purely physical level, Tierney is absolute perfection. Crain is merely 'cute'. Only my opinion of course, and it's a matter of taste. The only woman who came close to the sheer and total magnificence of TIerney was Grace Kelly, but--again--my opinion--Kelly seemed to have more of an unearthly coolness, an unattainability or even a kind of robotic asexuality.The spectacular color photography helps here and, of course, Ms. Tierney had the full powers of the most skillful makeup artists and photographers in the world, to actually enhance her beauty. The skin, the hair, the body, the eyes, the mouth....all even more riveting than the magnificent lakes and woods and skies of Maine. Watch Crain in her early scenes at the cabin with Cornel Wilde, who is, understandably, beyond help when it comes to Tierney. Crain is interested in Wilde, but as it's happened so many times before, the man is drawn like a magnet to the preternaturally beautiful and sexy Tierney. The vulgar term 'p*ssy whipped', comes to mind, used to describe men whose strength and determination is reducing to nothing by a certain woman. Vincent Price's character is of course also in love and/or hopelessly infatuated with the goddess, as most men would be, but she cruelly rebuffs him. The power of a woman's sexuality is on full display here, reducing men to quivering bowls of jelly. This is the kind of woman that men would do just about anything to possess, if only for a fleeting moment. They are drawn to her like panting dogs.Or at least, I was, ha ha!You can see in the acting of Tierney's long-suffering mother that she--the mother--knows that Tierney's character (Ellen) is 'not normal' mentally. Ellen's insane jealousy and possessiveness is explained away, by saying that Ellen 'loved too much.' Ellen is the walking and talking example of how important it is to not judge a book by the cover. Traditionally film and TV, even TV news, have cast physically ideal people for us ugly shlubs to look at. Who can argue with the wisdom of using a pretty girl to sell your product? Studies have shown that the physically handsome or beautiful job candidate will almost always be rated higher than the more homely candidate, even though both have exactly the same qualifications. All that said, Ellen is supremely attractive on the outside, but sick, rotten and diseased on the inside. But watch closely in certain scenes, and you will see her almost shake her head in disgust as she realizes how nuts she actually is, but cannot seem to do anything about it. This is one movie where we have a character with a gigantic gulf of a difference between how she looks on the outside, and the way she actually is on the inside. As Fred Sanford used to say, &#34;Beauty's only skin deep....but ugly go all the way to the bone!&#34;.The other thing that is still very chilling and disturbing is the drowning scene with Darryl Hickman as Wilde's younger, physically challenged brother. Ellen has him out in the canoe, he wants to swim all the way across the lake. Like a mother she carefully applies lotion to his back to prevent sunburn. But when she hears that he does not want to leave the area and intends to stay--thus continuing to be a bothersome obstacle to her husband's attention to her and her alone, she turns malicious and murderous. She rows after him as he swims, but when he tires and asks to climb back in, she ignores his pleas. She is shown frozen, the beautiful eyes hidden behind the tortoise shell dark glasses, the perfect face a mask of unfeeling psychosis and rage. The scene is still upsetting, and one which was revolutionary at the time.When she finds out she's preggers, she sees the baby as a horrid interruption that needs to be eliminated....and she finds a way to do it! There was never a character like this in all those nice 'women's pictures' of the forties. For that reason, and that reason alone, you should see this movie. But then you do have the bonus of a plethora of supremely magnificent scenery....much of it belonging to the one and only Gene Tierney.Oh, and be sure to see her achingly beautiful presence in an even better movie, the black and white Laura, by Otto Preminger. See tough cop Dana Andrews melt into a puddle of lukewarm water. Vincent Price also makes a memorable appearance.",4,Note To Cornel: Read the Fine Print!,1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,4971,"['wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'going', 'plot', 'others', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'very', 'ably', 'Actually', 'more', 'ode', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'review', 'film', 'so', '.read', 'wish', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'blow-by-blow', 'accounting/evaluation', 'scene', ""'d"", 'seen', 'years', 'ago', 'do', 'have', 'stream-of-consciousness', 'comments', 'watching', '1945', 'film', 'again', 'TCM', 'HD', 'two', 'nights', 'ago.Gene', 'Tierney', 'ah', 'yes', 'doubt', 'one', 'most', 'physically', 'beautiful', 'creatures', 'ever', 'walk', 'earth', 'let', 'alone', 'grace', 'silver', 'screen', 'Truly', 'incarnation', 'goddess', 'very', 'attractive', 'actress', 'movie', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'purely', 'physical', 'level', 'Tierney', 'absolute', 'perfection', 'Crain', 'merely', ""'cute"", 'Only', 'opinion', 'course', 'matter', 'taste', 'only', 'woman', 'who', 'came', 'close', 'sheer', 'total', 'magnificence', 'TIerney', 'was', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'again', 'opinion', 'Kelly', 'seemed', 'have', 'more', 'unearthly', 'coolness', 'unattainability', 'even', 'kind', 'robotic', 'asexuality.The', 'spectacular', 'color', 'photography', 'here', 'course', 'Ms.', 'Tierney', 'had', 'full', 'powers', 'most', 'skillful', 'makeup', 'artists', 'photographers', 'world', 'actually', 'enhance', 'beauty', 'skin', 'hair', 'body', 'eyes', 'mouth', '.all', 'even', 'more', 'riveting', 'magnificent', 'lakes', 'woods', 'skies', 'Maine', 'Watch', 'Crain', 'early', 'scenes', 'cabin', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'who', 'understandably', 'help', 'when', 'Tierney', 'Crain', 'interested', 'Wilde', 'happened', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'man', 'drawn', 'magnet', 'preternaturally', 'beautiful', 'sexy', 'Tierney', 'vulgar', 'term', 'p*ssy', 'whipped', 'mind', 'used', 'describe', 'men', 'strength', 'determination', 'reducing', 'nothing', 'certain', 'woman', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'character', 'course', 'also', 'love', 'and/or', 'hopelessly', 'infatuated', 'goddess', 'most', 'men', 'would', 'be', 'cruelly', 'rebuffs', 'power', 'woman', 'sexuality', 'full', 'display', 'here', 'reducing', 'men', 'quivering', 'bowls', 'jelly', 'kind', 'woman', 'men', 'would', 'do', 'just', 'anything', 'possess', 'only', 'fleeting', 'moment', 'are', 'drawn', 'panting', 'dogs.Or', 'least', 'was', 'ha', 'ha', 'can', 'see', 'acting', 'Tierney', 'long-suffering', 'mother', 'mother', 'Tierney', 'character', 'Ellen', ""'not"", 'normal', 'mentally', 'Ellen', 'insane', 'jealousy', 'possessiveness', 'explained', 'away', 'saying', 'Ellen', ""'loved"", 'too', 'much', 'Ellen', 'walking', 'talking', 'example', 'how', 'important', 'not', 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'Traditionally', 'film', 'TV', 'even', 'TV', 'news', 'have', 'cast', 'physically', 'ideal', 'people', 'ugly', 'shlubs', 'look', 'Who', 'can', 'argue', 'wisdom', 'using', 'pretty', 'girl', 'sell', 'product', 'Studies', 'have', 'shown', 'physically', 'handsome', 'beautiful', 'job', 'candidate', 'will', 'almost', 'always', 'be', 'rated', 'higher', 'more', 'homely', 'candidate', 'even', 'have', 'exactly', 'same', 'qualifications', 'said', 'Ellen', 'supremely', 'attractive', 'outside', 'sick', 'rotten', 'diseased', 'inside', 'watch', 'closely', 'certain', 'scenes', 'will', 'see', 'almost', 'shake', 'head', 'disgust', 'how', 'nuts', 'actually', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'do', 'anything', 'one', 'movie', 'where', 'have', 'character', 'gigantic', 'gulf', 'difference', 'how', 'outside', 'way', 'actually', 'inside', 'Fred', 'Sanford', 'used', 'say', '34', 'Beauty', 'only', 'skin', 'deep', '.but', 'ugly', 'go', 'way', 'bone', '34', '.The', 'other', 'thing', 'still', 'very', 'chilling', 'disturbing', 'drowning', 'scene', 'Darryl', 'Hickman', 'Wilde', 'younger', 'physically', 'challenged', 'brother', 'Ellen', 'out', 'canoe', 'swim', 'way', 'lake', 'mother', 'carefully', 'lotion', 'back', 'prevent', 'sunburn', 'when', 'not', 'want', 'leave', 'area', 'stay', 'thus', 'continuing', 'be', 'bothersome', 'obstacle', 'husband', 'attention', 'alone', 'malicious', 'murderous', 'when', 'climb', 'back', 'pleas', 'shown', 'frozen', 'beautiful', 'eyes', 'hidden', 'tortoise', 'shell', 'dark', 'glasses', 'perfect', 'face', 'mask', 'unfeeling', 'psychosis', 'rage', 'scene', 'still', 'upsetting', 'one', 'was', 'revolutionary', 'time.When', 'out', 'preggers', 'baby', 'horrid', 'interruption', 'be', 'eliminated', '.and', 'way', 'do', 'was', 'never', 'character', 'nice', ""'women"", 'pictures', ""'"", 'forties', 'reason', 'reason', 'alone', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'then', 'do', 'have', 'bonus', 'plethora', 'supremely', 'magnificent', 'scenery', '.much', 'belonging', 'one', 'only', 'Gene', 'Tierney.Oh', 'be', 'sure', 'see', 'achingly', 'beautiful', 'presence', 'even', 'better', 'movie', 'black', 'white', 'Laura', 'Otto', 'Preminger', 'See', 'tough', 'cop', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'melt', 'puddle', 'lukewarm', 'water', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'also', 'memorable', 'appearance']",N/A

370725,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,6303364772,Muzzlehatch,"[1, 1]","It's not surprising that John Stahl, a director who made his name helming lush romantic weepies like MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION would direct one of the most romantic and over-the-top of all films noir. Despite being in color, LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN fits the noir paradigm in many ways - the flashback structure indicating that the seemingly upstanding young man who begins the story taking a boat to his house in the wilds of Maine has a dark, terrible past; the femme fatale whose seductive powers are the root of all the ills suffered by both our hero and most of the other significant characters in the film; the terrible prices paid by the innocent, and the reach of fate beyond the grave.Ellen Berent (Gene Tierney) is the fatal femme in this tale, latching onto Cornel Wilde's somewhat nave writer Richard Harland when they meet by accident aboard train towards a New Mexico ranch where they are (also by chance) spending a vacation at the same time, he alone and she with her mother and sister. Except it's not entirely a vacation for the Harlands - they are scattering Ellen's father's ashes, and this plot point gives us several opportunities to note the powerful attachment that existed between the two - and that soon develops between Ellen and Richard, who bears a striking resemblance to the late Mr. Berent.Amazingly soon, Ellen has given up on her ambitious attorney fianc&eacute; (Vincent Price) and thrown herself wholly over to the smitten Richard, demanding more and more from him as the film progresses, and her madness and jealousy deepen. To say much more would spoil the fun...this is truly one of the crazier madwoman melodramas from the period, with vivid work from Tierney and Jeanne Crain as her nicer, saner sister and stunning, riotously colorful Technicolor photography from Leon Shamroy.  Price disappointingly doesn't get that many good scenes though he is suave and charming and reliable as ever when he is on screen.  I was less impressed by Wilde, and the coda seems a bit protracted and obvious to me, but still a must-see for noirophiles or fans of romantic excess - after all, Douglas Sirk was soon to remake a couple of Stahl's earlier films, and he must have known this one quite well also.",4,Lurid color and even more lurid story in a lush and strange noir,1254182400,"09 29, 2009",2009,2222,"['not', 'surprising', 'John', 'Stahl', 'director', 'who', 'made', 'name', 'helming', 'lush', 'romantic', 'weepies', 'MAGNIFICENT', 'OBSESSION', 'would', 'direct', 'one', 'most', 'romantic', 'over-the-top', 'films', 'noir', 'being', 'color', 'LEAVE', 'HER', 'TO', 'HEAVEN', 'noir', 'paradigm', 'many', 'ways', 'flashback', 'structure', 'indicating', 'seemingly', 'upstanding', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'story', 'taking', 'boat', 'house', 'wilds', 'Maine', 'dark', 'terrible', 'past', 'femme', 'fatale', 'seductive', 'powers', 'are', 'root', 'ills', 'suffered', 'hero', 'most', 'other', 'significant', 'characters', 'film', 'terrible', 'prices', 'paid', 'innocent', 'reach', 'fate', 'grave.Ellen', 'Berent', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'fatal', 'femme', 'tale', 'latching', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'somewhat', 'nave', 'writer', 'Richard', 'Harland', 'when', 'meet', 'accident', 'aboard', 'train', 'New', 'Mexico', 'ranch', 'where', 'are', 'also', 'chance', 'spending', 'vacation', 'same', 'time', 'alone', 'mother', 'sister', 'not', 'entirely', 'vacation', 'Harlands', 'are', 'scattering', 'Ellen', 'father', 'ashes', 'plot', 'point', 'several', 'opportunities', 'note', 'powerful', 'attachment', 'existed', 'two', 'soon', 'Ellen', 'Richard', 'who', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'late', 'Mr.', 'Berent.Amazingly', 'soon', 'Ellen', 'given', 'up', 'ambitious', 'attorney', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'thrown', 'wholly', 'smitten', 'Richard', 'demanding', 'more', 'more', 'film', 'madness', 'jealousy', 'deepen', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'would', 'spoil', 'fun', 'truly', 'one', 'crazier', 'madwoman', 'melodramas', 'period', 'vivid', 'work', 'Tierney', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'nicer', 'saner', 'sister', 'stunning', 'riotously', 'colorful', 'Technicolor', 'photography', 'Leon', 'Shamroy', 'Price', 'disappointingly', ""n't"", 'get', 'many', 'good', 'scenes', 'suave', 'charming', 'reliable', 'ever', 'when', 'screen', 'was', 'less', 'impressed', 'Wilde', 'coda', 'bit', 'protracted', 'obvious', 'still', 'must-see', 'noirophiles', 'fans', 'romantic', 'excess', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'was', 'soon', 'remake', 'couple', 'Stahl', 'earlier', 'films', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'one', 'quite', 'well', 'also']",N/A
370726,A3ET9OE3TQ9OEJ,6303364772,Nix Pix,"[9, 9]","By its very definition, &quot;film noir&quot; (meaning, dark film) does not encompass Technicolor productions. A shame, since Darryl F. Zanuck's &quot;Leave Her To Heaven&quot; (1945) is as thrilling, disturbing and evocative of the noir style as anything shot in black and white. At best then, let's just say that &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; is a rich, finely wrought tapestry of sinaster thoughts and destructive ambition. The film, based on a novel by Ben Ames Williams, is concerned with the seemingly congenial romance that blossoms between famous writer, Richard Harland (Cornel Wilde, looking quite stylish and very handsome) and statuesque beauty, Ellen Berent (Gene Tierney, as smoldering, sultry and radiant as ever). Richard and Ellen meet as strangers on a train - a chance pairing that leads to an idyllic first summer retreat in the mountains with Ellen's family; mother, (Mary Philips), father (Ray Collins) and younger sister (fresh faced Jeanne Crain - clearly being groomed on this occasion as the odds on favorite for Richard's affections). A slight hickup in Ellen's plans happens when her former beaux, Russell Quinton (Vincent Price) deliberately turns out to pitch a little rice on the side of her pending nuptuals. Later, Quinton's own desires for Ellen will culminate in his prosecution of Richard for murder. But for now, Ellen isn't about to let anything or anyone come between her and the man of her passions.By the time Tierney made &quot;Leave Her To Heaven&quot; she had developed a reputation as Fox's good girl. The culmination of this role and her formidable zest to make the transformation from congenial maiden to cold-hearted vixen believable, forever altered that perception of her in Hollywood.As her younger sister, Jeanne Crain is an excellent foil and runner up for Richard's affections. Even Vincent Price is exceptionally convincing as Ellen's former and very jealous lover. The one disappointment, in terms of acting, is Cornel Wilde. Undeniably eye candy, Wilde's performance comes off rather stiff and unconvincing once the character of Richard awakens from his love struck stupor and realizes what sort of monster he's actually married. Nevertheless, the material given to all is indestructible, and directed with slick and sinaster panache by the gifted John M. Stahl, &quot;Leave Her To Heaven&quot; emerges as sensational sure fire entertainment.Fox Home Entertainment has done a simply outstanding job in remastering this film for DVD. From its opening title sequence, so clear and finely rendered that one can make out the texture of paper on which the actor's names have been printed, to the deep focus photography which is luminous, there is absolutely no finer example of a Technicolor film to video transfer of this vintage available on the home video market today. Colors are rich and fully saturated. Shadow and contrast levels are superbly rendered. Clarity and fine detail throughout is outstanding. Blacks are solid and deep. Whites are pristine. The exterior photography is absolutely eye-popping. The audio has been remixed to stereo. But there is very little to distinguish it from the original Mono mix that has also been included. Extras include a stills gallery, audio commentary track, restoration comparison and theatrical trailer. Highly recommended for anyone who loves classic films.",4,Can't Leave This One To Chance - A Brilliant Thriller!,1109980800,"03 5, 2005",2005,3360,"['very', 'definition', 'quot', 'film', 'noir', 'quot', 'meaning', 'dark', 'film', 'not', 'encompass', 'Technicolor', 'productions', 'shame', 'Darryl', 'F.', 'Zanuck', 'quot', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'quot', '1945', 'thrilling', 'disturbing', 'evocative', 'noir', 'style', 'anything', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'best', 'then', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'quot', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'quot', 'rich', 'finely', 'wrought', 'tapestry', 'sinaster', 'thoughts', 'destructive', 'ambition', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'Ben', 'Ames', 'Williams', 'concerned', 'seemingly', 'congenial', 'romance', 'famous', 'writer', 'Richard', 'Harland', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'looking', 'quite', 'stylish', 'very', 'handsome', 'statuesque', 'beauty', 'Ellen', 'Berent', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'smoldering', 'sultry', 'radiant', 'ever', 'Richard', 'Ellen', 'meet', 'strangers', 'train', 'chance', 'pairing', 'idyllic', 'first', 'summer', 'retreat', 'mountains', 'Ellen', 'family', 'Mary', 'Philips', 'father', 'Ray', 'Collins', 'younger', 'sister', 'fresh', 'faced', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'clearly', 'being', 'groomed', 'occasion', 'odds', 'favorite', 'Richard', 'affections', 'slight', 'hickup', 'Ellen', 'plans', 'when', 'former', 'beaux', 'Russell', 'Quinton', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'deliberately', 'out', 'pitch', 'little', 'rice', 'side', 'pending', 'nuptuals', 'Later', 'Quinton', 'own', 'desires', 'Ellen', 'will', 'culminate', 'prosecution', 'Richard', 'murder', 'now', 'Ellen', ""n't"", 'about', 'let', 'anything', 'anyone', 'come', 'man', 'passions.By', 'time', 'Tierney', 'made', 'quot', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'quot', 'had', 'developed', 'reputation', 'Fox', 'good', 'girl', 'culmination', 'role', 'formidable', 'zest', 'make', 'transformation', 'congenial', 'maiden', 'cold-hearted', 'vixen', 'believable', 'forever', 'altered', 'perception', 'Hollywood.As', 'younger', 'sister', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'excellent', 'foil', 'runner', 'up', 'Richard', 'affections', 'Even', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'exceptionally', 'convincing', 'Ellen', 'former', 'very', 'jealous', 'lover', 'one', 'disappointment', 'terms', 'acting', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'Undeniably', 'eye', 'candy', 'Wilde', 'performance', 'rather', 'stiff', 'unconvincing', 'once', 'character', 'Richard', 'love', 'struck', 'stupor', 'what', 'sort', 'monster', 'actually', 'married', 'Nevertheless', 'material', 'given', 'indestructible', 'directed', 'slick', 'sinaster', 'panache', 'gifted', 'John', 'M.', 'Stahl', 'quot', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'quot', 'sensational', 'sure', 'fire', 'entertainment.Fox', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'done', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'job', 'remastering', 'film', 'DVD', 'opening', 'title', 'sequence', 'clear', 'finely', 'rendered', 'one', 'can', 'make', 'out', 'texture', 'paper', 'actor', 'names', 'have', 'been', 'printed', 'deep', 'focus', 'photography', 'luminous', 'absolutely', 'finer', 'example', 'Technicolor', 'film', 'video', 'transfer', 'vintage', 'available', 'home', 'video', 'market', 'today', 'Colors', 'are', 'rich', 'fully', 'saturated', 'Shadow', 'contrast', 'levels', 'are', 'superbly', 'rendered', 'Clarity', 'fine', 'detail', 'outstanding', 'Blacks', 'are', 'solid', 'deep', 'Whites', 'are', 'pristine', 'exterior', 'photography', 'absolutely', 'eye-popping', 'audio', 'been', 'remixed', 'stereo', 'very', 'little', 'distinguish', 'original', 'Mono', 'mix', 'also', 'been', 'included', 'Extras', 'include', 'stills', 'gallery', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'restoration', 'comparison', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'classic', 'films']",N/A
370727,A2UUYORVIZ00UH,6303364772,Noirdame,"[3, 4]","Lushly photographed in Oscar-winning Techincolor, this film version of Ben Ames William's novel is an engrossingly watchable portrait of a possessive, jealous woman, a role that earned Gene Tierney an Oscar nomination.There is an obvious tension between Ellen Berent (Tierney) and her mother (Mary Phillips), especially when it is hinted that Ellen and her late father had a special, close relationship. When the exotically beautiful socialite Ellen meets the handsome, gentle, and rather naive novelist Richard Harland (Cornel Wilde), she is taken with him because of his resemblance to her deceased dad. They gather with Ellen's family at the ranch of a mutual friend, and Ellen has Richard under her spell, discarding her fianc'e Russell Quinton (Vincent Price)like last week's garbage. She proposes to Richard, and states breathlessly, ""I'll never let you go,"", and the poor guy (and the audience) has no idea what he is in for. It also seems that everyone but Richard (and the viewer) is aware of Ellen's demands of attention and possessiveness, as the narrator and family friend Glen Robie states early in the film, ""Ellen always wins"", and ""Nothing ever happens to Ellen"".As soon as they are married, they travel to Georgia to meet Richard's handicapped brother, Danny (Darryl Hickman), and although Ellen helps look after him (and even teaches him to walk with crutches) she is incensed by the intrusion of him into their lives, their home, and basically, of any other person coming between her and her husband. When her mother and sister Ruth (Jeanne Crain) come for a visit, she is all but enraged and her icy reception sucks all the fun out of that party!!! After her family departs, Ellen secretly takes Danny out in the lake for swimming, and deliberately lets the poor boy drown so she can have Richard all to herself. The crestfallen novelist and his manipulative bride then go to stay with Ellen's family, and on the advice of Ruth, she decides to give Richard a baby. However, Ellen is soon disillusioned with the idea, bemoans the fact that she will soon lose her figure (and her husband's attention), she coldly puts on a beautiful blue evening gown, applies red lipstick and deliberately throws herself down a flight of stairs, and succeeds in miscarrying the son that Richard so wanted. She then focuses her obsession on to her gentle sister, seeing the friendship Ruth shares with Richard, and in a self-righteous tirade, berates her long-suffering sibling (actually cousin adopted by the family), unwittingly revealing her dastardly deeds for Richard to overhear. He leaves her, preparing to file for divorce, so Ellen hatches her most evil scheme of all - she writes a letter to Quinton saying that Ruth is planning to kill her, and then poisons herself at a family picnic in order to frame her sister. The truth, however comes out at trial and Harland is forced to serve a prison sentence of two years due to his knowledge of Ellen's crimes, but once he has served his time, he and Ruth, whom had declared her love for him at the trial, unite against a epic sunset . . . . . . . .Tierney and Crain look fabulous, and could easily pass for sisters. Ellen's ""nightmare"" is an effective foreshadowing of Danny's death, and her jealousy over Enid Southern, a girl from Harland's past, adds more richness to the movie. Chill Wills is great as handyman Thorne, and Vincent Price is a perfect unwitting accomplice in Ellen's last scheme. There are biblical references that resound in the film, for example, Ellen is portrayed as a serpent emerging from dark waters in one scene, while Ruth is presented as an angelic, nurturing, gardening, animal-loving cherub. Another interesting analogy is that on the way to the ranch, Ellen is anticipating hunting and eating wild turkey, while Ruth can't wait to see the new colts. The theme music is dramatic and adds fuel to the already burning fire of the drama.It is classified as film noir, and even with the color photography, it makes sense. An interesting presentation of a truly malicious character.The DVD features a still gallery, Movietone News Footage, Restoration Comparision, theatricial trailers, one for the film itself as well as four other Fox movies.  The commentary, on a single track, by Richard Schickel, who makes so many errors that it gets to be annoying, and Darryl Hickman, who doesn't seem to have much positive reflections of the film, cast or director, bemoans the fact that he was a child actor who was controlled by the studios.  If he didn't have anything good to say, why did he participate in the commentary (which, for the record, was recorded separately), if it brings back such bad memories for him?Don't let that dampen your opinion of the movie - it has some flaws, but that does not deter the film's classic status, or Gene Tierney's much deserved Oscar-nomination.",5,What Shall Be Done With This Jealous Woman?

Hickman, although I respect him for the extremely difficult and dangerous swimming scene, seems unaware, ignorant of Gene Tierney, the actress nor Gene's horrific personal life. And  20th Century Fox really should have hired somebody much better than the stupid, arrogant Richard Shiskel for the commentary. Martin Scorsese would have been terrific for LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN commentary, since this film is one of Martin's favorite films ever and has influenced his own multiple films.Gene Tierney gives a wonderful performance as does the entire cast. The direction and editing is right on. And the sets are unbelievable--the Taos, New Mexico sprawling home; Back of the Moon, gorgeous, lake side home. And the colors are beautiful.It is surprising that such shocking, disturbing subject matter could be dealt with in the ultra conservative 1940's. However, when LHTH was being made we and the world were in the brutal mid of World War II, so I figure nothing was shocking after the realities of the day. Still, few movies of that time, DOUBLE INDEMNITY, MILDRED PIERCE, and THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE only begin to come close, match the horror and shock of HEAVE HER TO HEAVEN. The later PSYCHO and DIOBLIQUE come to mind.And the LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN soundtrack is outstanding. One of the best, most succesful movie music ever alongside VERTIGO and PSYCHO, to showcase and impress the psychological movement and mental state of the lead character.Viewer, take this movie for what it is and watch it with insight, background, and intellligence. LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN is a true classic masterpiece and should be on every top movies of all time list.",5,"Fabulous Gene Tierney from Fairfield, Connecticut!",1341446400,"07 5, 2012",2012,1940,"['just', 'watched', 'LEAVE', 'HER', 'TO', 'HEAVEN', 'again', 'remember', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'very', 'young', 'everybody', 'was', 'reading', 'Ben', 'Ames', 'Williams', 'novel', 'discussing', 'shocking', 'movie', 'especially', 'lake/swim', 'scene', 'Gene', 'Tierney.The', 'movie', 'great', 'commentary', 'outrageously', 'bad', 'place', 'Hickman', 'respect', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'dangerous', 'swimming', 'scene', 'unaware', 'ignorant', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'actress', 'Gene', 'horrific', 'personal', 'life', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'hired', 'somebody', 'much', 'better', 'stupid', 'arrogant', 'Richard', 'Shiskel', 'commentary', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'terrific', 'LEAVE', 'HER', 'TO', 'HEAVEN', 'commentary', 'film', 'one', 'Martin', 'favorite', 'films', 'ever', 'influenced', 'own', 'multiple', 'films.Gene', 'Tierney', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'entire', 'cast', 'direction', 'editing', 'right', 'sets', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'Taos', 'New', 'Mexico', 'sprawling', 'home', 'Back', 'Moon', 'gorgeous', 'lake', 'side', 'home', 'colors', 'are', 'beautiful.It', 'surprising', 'such', 'shocking', 'disturbing', 'subject', 'matter', 'could', 'be', 'dealt', 'ultra', 'conservative', '1940', 'However', 'when', 'LHTH', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'world', 'were', 'brutal', 'mid', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'figure', 'nothing', 'was', 'shocking', 'realities', 'day', 'Still', 'few', 'movies', 'time', 'DOUBLE', 'INDEMNITY', 'MILDRED', 'PIERCE', 'THE', 'POSTMAN', 'ALWAYS', 'RINGS', 'TWICE', 'only', 'come', 'close', 'match', 'horror', 'shock', 'HEAVE', 'HER', 'TO', 'HEAVEN', 'later', 'PSYCHO', 'DIOBLIQUE', 'come', 'mind.And', 'LEAVE', 'HER', 'TO', 'HEAVEN', 'soundtrack', 'outstanding', 'One', 'best', 'most', 'succesful', 'movie', 'music', 'ever', 'alongside', 'VERTIGO', 'PSYCHO', 'showcase', 'impress', 'psychological', 'movement', 'mental', 'state', 'lead', 'character.Viewer', 'take', 'movie', 'what', 'watch', 'insight', 'background', 'intellligence', 'LEAVE', 'HER', 'TO', 'HEAVEN', 'true', 'classic', 'masterpiece', 'should', 'be', 'top', 'movies', 'time', 'list']",N/A
370734,A1DRM3JV6T5O6P,6303364772,Phillip Oliver,"[13, 14]","An example of 1940s romantic melodrama at its best, ""Leave Her To Heaven"" may seem like an outlandish story but it is a memorable one and certainly one of the most gorgeously photographed Technicolor films ever made (the visual style of the film is similar to Douglas Sirk's 1950s melodramas). The photography by Leon Shamroy (who won a well deserved Oscar for this) features beautiful location settings in New Mexico, Arizona and Bass Lake, California. Gene Tierney, fresh from her most famous role in ""Laura"" is outrageously gorgeous as the cold and insanely jealous heroine. Jeanne Crain, in one of her first roles, is a tad plastic as the sympathetic half sister and Cornel Wilde is fine as the hapless fly drawn into Tierney's web.DVD extras include a photo gallery, two Movietone features (one on the Academy Awards and the other on the premiere) and an audio commentary by TIME critic Richard Schickel and actor Darryl Hickman, who played Danny in the film. Schnickel's comments are not particularly interesting but Hickman's recollections of being a child actor and working on the set of ""LHTH"" are often fascinating. Hickman recalls friendships with fellow child stars Shirley Temple and Roddy McDowell and talks about what difficult lives child actors endured. His comments about the actors he worked with are particularly interesting - Gene Tierney was remote and unkind to both him and co-star Cornel Wilde and director John Stahl doesn't recieve kind remarks either. On the other hand, Hickman remembers Cornel Wilde and Jeanne Crain as kind and easy to work with. Hickman has since become an acting teacher and coach and his comments are often concerned with acting techniques (he is especially unimpressed with Tierney's acting abilities).",5,"""I'll never let you go, never!""",1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,1754,"['example', '1940s', 'romantic', 'melodrama', 'best', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'may', 'seem', 'outlandish', 'story', 'memorable', 'one', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'gorgeously', 'photographed', 'Technicolor', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'visual', 'style', 'film', 'similar', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', '1950s', 'melodramas', 'photography', 'Leon', 'Shamroy', 'who', 'won', 'well', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'beautiful', 'location', 'settings', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Arizona', 'Bass', 'Lake', 'California', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'fresh', 'most', 'famous', 'role', 'Laura', 'outrageously', 'gorgeous', 'cold', 'insanely', 'jealous', 'heroine', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'one', 'first', 'roles', 'tad', 'plastic', 'sympathetic', 'half', 'sister', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'fine', 'hapless', 'fly', 'drawn', 'Tierney', 'web.DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'photo', 'gallery', 'two', 'Movietone', 'features', 'one', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'other', 'premiere', 'audio', 'commentary', 'TIME', 'critic', 'Richard', 'Schickel', 'actor', 'Darryl', 'Hickman', 'who', 'played', 'Danny', 'film', 'Schnickel', 'comments', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'Hickman', 'recollections', 'being', 'child', 'actor', 'working', 'set', 'LHTH', 'are', 'often', 'fascinating', 'Hickman', 'friendships', 'fellow', 'child', 'stars', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'Roddy', 'McDowell', 'talks', 'what', 'difficult', 'child', 'actors', 'endured', 'comments', 'actors', 'worked', 'are', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'was', 'remote', 'unkind', 'co-star', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'director', 'John', 'Stahl', ""n't"", 'recieve', 'kind', 'remarks', 'either', 'other', 'hand', 'Hickman', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'kind', 'easy', 'work', 'Hickman', 'become', 'acting', 'teacher', 'coach', 'comments', 'are', 'often', 'concerned', 'acting', 'techniques', 'especially', 'unimpressed', 'Tierney', 'acting', 'abilities']",N/A

He's great! Also great is Jeanne Crain, in one of her first films. This is a real-life horror film, and I'm at a loss to think of such an evil character today in film, not counting slasher films.

(This film was Wilde's first starring role.  He was an Olympic fencer who got into the movies coaching actors in sword fighting.)  The luminous Jeanne Crain plays Tierney's kindly sister and a slim, young Vincent Price is a Tierney's dumped fiance, a sententious, vindictive prosecuting attorney.Exploring some of the same emotional terrain as Douglas Sirk's films (""All That Heaven Allows,"" ""Written on the Wind""), this quintessential romance does not presume to present real life in a gritty way. Rather, it's an example of what Hollywood once did best when the studios were run by filmmakers and not executives.Hickman says director Stahl was borderline sadistic, forcing him to repeat take after take of a grueling waterscene in freezing Bass Lake until he was cramped and exhausted.  Stahl never called Hickman by name until producer Darryl F. Zanuck sent a note praising Hickman's acting.  Hickman says Stahl was rude to Wilde. And that the much more experienced Tierney was unhelpful and cold to newcomer Wilde and everyone else in the cast.The terrific commentary is filled with Hickman's numerous, unabashed observations about this film, the movie business, and acting techniques and styles.

This film noir, told in extended flashback as the husband returns home from an unjust prison term, is unusual in that it is in vibrant Technicolor rather than the genre's usual black-and-white. But the contrast between visual brilliance and psychosis enhances the horror. In her autobiography, Gene Tierney wrote that she had wanted to play Ellen Berent ever since she read Ben Ames Williams's novel. She worked well with John Stahl, and ""blossomed under his direction."" Besides the sets at Twentieth Century-Fox, filming was done on location in Arizona, northern California, and Georgia. The real star of the film may be Leon Shamroy's Technicolor cinematography, which earned the picture its only Academy Award and is still beautiful more than sixty years later.The recent Fox Studio Classics DVD release of ""Leave Her to Heaven"" contains an excellent transfer of the restored film, relevant contemporary newsreels, a restoration comparison, and commentary by supporting actor Darryl Hickman and critic Richard Schickel. Both Hickman and Schickel offer interesting insights, but each is sometimes condescending toward the acting talents of Tierney, Cornel Wilde, and particularly Jeanne Crain. Inexplicably and inexcusably, Schickel repeatedly pronounces director Stahl's name ""Sphal.""",5,Great Technicolor Horror,1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,1531,"['Called', 'trashy', 'melodrama', 'critics', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'story', 'demented', 'woman', 'husband', 'who', 'trapped', 'web', 'possession', 'insanity', 'murder', 'trash', 'zenith', 'prime', 'example', '1940s', 'studio', 'opulence', 'film', 'noir', 'told', 'extended', 'flashback', 'husband', 'home', 'unjust', 'prison', 'term', 'unusual', 'vibrant', 'Technicolor', 'rather', 'genre', 'usual', 'black-and-white', 'contrast', 'visual', 'brilliance', 'psychosis', 'horror', 'autobiography', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'wrote', 'had', 'wanted', 'play', 'Ellen', 'Berent', 'ever', 'read', 'Ben', 'Ames', 'Williams', 'novel', 'worked', 'well', 'John', 'Stahl', 'blossomed', 'direction', 'sets', 'Twentieth', 'Century-Fox', 'filming', 'was', 'done', 'location', 'Arizona', 'northern', 'California', 'Georgia', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'Leon', 'Shamroy', 'Technicolor', 'cinematography', 'earned', 'picture', 'only', 'Academy', 'Award', 'still', 'beautiful', 'more', 'sixty', 'years', 'later.The', 'recent', 'Fox', 'Studio', 'Classics', 'DVD', 'release', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'excellent', 'transfer', 'restored', 'film', 'relevant', 'contemporary', 'newsreels', 'restoration', 'comparison', 'commentary', 'supporting', 'actor', 'Darryl', 'Hickman', 'critic', 'Richard', 'Schickel', 'Hickman', 'Schickel', 'offer', 'interesting', 'insights', 'sometimes', 'condescending', 'acting', 'talents', 'Tierney', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'particularly', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'Inexplicably', 'inexcusably', 'Schickel', 'repeatedly', 'director', 'Stahl', 'name', 'Sphal']",N/A

Tierney's role of  Ellen Berent has received almost cult status over the years since her  character is that of an obsessive and cruel, selfish and evil woman; her  relationship with Cornel Wilde indeed makes for an unusual and strange love  story! Ben Ames William's novel of the same name was released in 1944 and  was read by over a million people; the public was obviously captivated by  this lurid little tale of a psychopathic wife. While being more than a  little melodramatic, the story's believability is quite implausible at  times, however the film lingers in the psyche nevertheless (the scene where  Ellen lets Wilde's crippled little brother Hickman drown out of sheer  jealousy is genuinely disturbing). Classic line: Ellen's mother:  &quot;There's nothing wrong with Ellen. She just loves too much!&quot;  Rarely has such a wicked woman looked as beautiful as Tierney does in this  unusual story of obsessive &quot;love&quot;.",4,GLORIOUS TECHNICOLOR SCENERY PLUS GORGEOUS GENE TIERNEY,958435200,"05 16, 2000",2000,1136,"['real', 'star', 'fascinating', 'little', 'movie', 'breath-taking', 'Technicolor', 'photography', 'Maine', 'New', 'Mexico', 'even', 'architecture', 'great', 'look', 'gorgeous', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'Tierney', 'role', 'Ellen', 'Berent', 'received', 'almost', 'cult', 'status', 'years', 'character', 'obsessive', 'cruel', 'selfish', 'evil', 'woman', 'relationship', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'indeed', 'unusual', 'strange', 'love', 'story', 'Ben', 'Ames', 'William', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'released', '1944', 'was', 'read', 'million', 'people', 'public', 'was', 'obviously', 'captivated', 'lurid', 'little', 'tale', 'psychopathic', 'wife', 'being', 'more', 'little', 'melodramatic', 'story', 'believability', 'quite', 'implausible', 'times', 'however', 'film', 'lingers', 'psyche', 'nevertheless', 'scene', 'where', 'Ellen', 'Wilde', 'crippled', 'little', 'brother', 'Hickman', 'sheer', 'jealousy', 'genuinely', 'disturbing', 'Classic', 'line', 'Ellen', 'mother', 'quot', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'Ellen', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'quot', 'Rarely', 'such', 'wicked', 'woman', 'looked', 'as', 'beautiful', 'Tierney', 'unusual', 'story', 'obsessive', 'quot', 'quot']",N/A
370745,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,6303364772,Sean Pasek,"[5, 5]","*SPOILER ALERT*""Leave Her to Heaven"" may be the quintessential story of jealousy and obsession.  This film, which came out in 1946 and certainly daring for its time, tells the story of a beautiful woman, whose obsession and jealousy destroys everyone around her.  I'm not sure if any other film on the subject matter has been done as well as this one.The story centers around a woman who ""loves"" her husband, Richard Harland, so much, that she is willing to do anything and everything for him.  However, she wants him all to herself.  Not even the company of other family members is greeted with gratitude from the cold Ellen Berent.  She sees everyone else as obstacles, and she desperately tries to find means of ""eliminating"" those people by whatever means.  I still get chills during the scene in which Ellen sits in the boat and watches Danny, the brother of Richard, drown even when he cries to Ellen for help.  This single scene really sets the tone for the rest of the film, for the audience now has a clear idea of how cold, calculating, and even diabolical, Ellen can be.This movie simply cannot be mentioned without recognizing Gene Tierney in, arguably, her best performce of her career, which is saying something considering her vast body of work.  But the character of Ellen Berent is the most complex character of the film, and Tierney expertly weaves the character from seemingly soft and loving, to vicious and brutal.  This is not an easy task for an actor or actress to tackle.  This isn't like Glenn Close's character from ""Fatal Attraction.""  Ellen is much more subtle and calculating.  Ellen believes all of her actions are justified by her ""love"" for Richard.  She never realizes that she destroys their relationship by destroying everyone around Richard.Cornel Wilde does a great job with the character of Richard Harland.  He's a writer who meets Ellen aboard a train to the Jacinto, New Mexico.  It's obvious that he's captivated by her right from the start, and he soon tries to spend as much time with her as possible.  However, doubts quickly begin to seep in after Ellen coldly informs her former fiance, Russell Quinton (wonderfully played by Vincent Price), that she's marrying Richard.  This is news to Richard since he had no idea about their upcoming marriage.  One of the most effective scenes in the film is just after Ellen has berated her cousin, Ruth, for seemingly getting all of Richard's attention.  Ellen is unaware of Richard standing there listening to her jealous tirade.  Richard simply stands there and stares at Ellen, as if he's seeing her for the first time.  The look is all that is needed, and it creates enough tension for the audience as Ellen quickly begins back-pedaling and trying to explain things to him.Perhaps least recognized is Jeanne Crain as Ruth Berent.  She isn't in the film much, and when she is, she's mostly in the background.  And yet, Crain has to use as much time in her scenes to establish in a very subtle but effective way, that Ruth loves Richard.  Ruth is softer but also more quiet.  She's a woman who isn't interested in getting attention.  She knows all about Ellen, and it is through Ruth and the looks on her face that we get a hint that something is terribly wrong about Ellen.  Ruth conveys those feelings with small looks of concern.  She knows that Richard is in trouble.Perhaps more than any other film, ""Leave Her to Heaven"" most effectively demonstrates the destructive emotions of jealousy, and how they can affect all those around.  Gene Tierney stated, ""Jealousy is, I think, the worst of all faults because it makes a victim of both parties.""Nearly every master and saint have talked about love as being something that you have to give/to let go.  It isn't something that can be held without giving it.  Ellen's statement to Richard of ""I'll never let you go"" is actually a scary thing to hear, because it demonstrates that she doesn't feel love for Richard, but an obsession for his attention.  Perhaps that is why we can agree with Richard in the end when he states, ""Yes, Ellen was that kind of monster.""""Leave Her to Heaven"" is a powerful film with tremendous acting performances all around.  It addresses the issues of jealousy and obsession in a poignantly frightful way.",5,"""I'll Never Let You Go""",1256515200,"10 26, 2009",2009,4274,"['*SPOILER', 'ALERT*', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'may', 'be', 'quintessential', 'story', 'jealousy', 'obsession', 'film', 'came', 'out', '1946', 'certainly', 'daring', 'time', 'story', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'obsession', 'jealousy', 'destroys', 'everyone', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'other', 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'been', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'one.The', 'story', 'centers', 'woman', 'who', 'loves', 'husband', 'Richard', 'Harland', 'so', 'much', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'everything', 'However', 'herself', 'Not', 'even', 'company', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'greeted', 'gratitude', 'cold', 'Ellen', 'Berent', 'everyone', 'else', 'obstacles', 'desperately', 'find', 'means', 'eliminating', 'people', 'means', 'still', 'get', 'chills', 'scene', 'Ellen', 'boat', 'watches', 'Danny', 'brother', 'Richard', 'drown', 'even', 'when', 'Ellen', 'help', 'single', 'scene', 'really', 'tone', 'rest', 'film', 'audience', 'now', 'clear', 'idea', 'how', 'cold', 'calculating', 'even', 'diabolical', 'Ellen', 'can', 'be.This', 'movie', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'mentioned', 'recognizing', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'arguably', 'best', 'performce', 'career', 'saying', 'something', 'considering', 'vast', 'body', 'work', 'character', 'Ellen', 'Berent', 'most', 'complex', 'character', 'film', 'Tierney', 'expertly', 'character', 'seemingly', 'soft', 'loving', 'vicious', 'brutal', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'actor', 'actress', 'tackle', ""n't"", 'like', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'character', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'Ellen', 'much', 'more', 'subtle', 'calculating', 'Ellen', 'actions', 'are', 'justified', 'love', 'Richard', 'never', 'relationship', 'destroying', 'everyone', 'Richard.Cornel', 'Wilde', 'great', 'job', 'character', 'Richard', 'Harland', 'writer', 'who', 'Ellen', 'train', 'Jacinto', 'New', 'Mexico', 'obvious', 'captivated', 'right', 'start', 'soon', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'possible', 'However', 'doubts', 'quickly', 'begin', 'seep', 'Ellen', 'coldly', 'former', 'fiance', 'Russell', 'Quinton', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'marrying', 'Richard', 'news', 'Richard', 'had', 'idea', 'upcoming', 'marriage', 'One', 'most', 'effective', 'scenes', 'film', 'just', 'Ellen', 'berated', 'cousin', 'Ruth', 'seemingly', 'getting', 'Richard', 'attention', 'Ellen', 'unaware', 'Richard', 'standing', 'there', 'listening', 'jealous', 'tirade', 'Richard', 'simply', 'stares', 'Ellen', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'look', 'needed', 'enough', 'tension', 'audience', 'Ellen', 'quickly', 'back-pedaling', 'trying', 'explain', 'things', 'him.Perhaps', 'least', 'recognized', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'Ruth', 'Berent', ""n't"", 'film', 'much', 'when', 'mostly', 'background', 'yet', 'Crain', 'use', 'much', 'time', 'scenes', 'establish', 'very', 'subtle', 'effective', 'way', 'Ruth', 'Richard', 'Ruth', 'softer', 'also', 'more', 'quiet', 'woman', 'who', ""n't"", 'interested', 'getting', 'attention', 'Ellen', 'Ruth', 'looks', 'face', 'get', 'hint', 'something', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'Ellen', 'Ruth', 'conveys', 'feelings', 'small', 'looks', 'concern', 'Richard', 'trouble.Perhaps', 'more', 'other', 'film', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'most', 'effectively', 'destructive', 'emotions', 'jealousy', 'how', 'can', 'affect', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'stated', 'Jealousy', 'think', 'worst', 'faults', 'victim', 'parties', 'Nearly', 'master', 'saint', 'have', 'talked', 'about', 'love', 'being', 'something', 'have', 'give/to', 'let', 'go', ""n't"", 'something', 'can', 'be', 'held', 'giving', 'Ellen', 'statement', 'Richard', ""'ll"", 'never', 'let', 'go', 'actually', 'scary', 'thing', 'hear', ""n't"", 'feel', 'love', 'Richard', 'obsession', 'attention', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'can', 'agree', 'Richard', 'end', 'when', 'Yes', 'Ellen', 'was', 'kind', 'monster', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'powerful', 'film', 'tremendous', 'acting', 'performances', 'around', 'issues', 'jealousy', 'obsession', 'poignantly', 'frightful', 'way']",N/A
370746,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6303364772,Simon Davis,"[10, 10]","""Leave Her To Heaven"" is in many ways quite a disturbing and unsettling film while never failing to intrigue me with its story based on a well known book by Ben Ames Williams of a beautiful but quite disturbed young woman who must have everything she desires entirely to herself no matter what the cost. We have probably all experienced moments of possessiveness in our lives but in this story it is taken to the extreme with ultimately tragic results.The stunning Gene Tierney, probably one of the most beautiful actresses ever to grace the screen was reaching her peak in early 1945 when this film went into production having already filmed the classic ""Laura"" two years earlier. With ""Leave Her To Heaven"" she got her one Academy Award nomination playing the disturbed and manipulative Ellen Berent a priveledged young lady who sets her sight on something and never lets up until she has obtained it. In this instance the object of her affection is Richard Harland (Cornel Wilde)a successful writer who she meets on a train and later marries. The film chronicles her slow descent into an obsessive need to keep Richard to herself at the expense of family, friends and even human life. Her psychopathic need to keep her husband to herself finds her jilting her current fiance (Vincent Price) without so much as an explanation, alienating Richard's friend Leick (Chill Wills), deliberatly loosing her unborn baby, and in the most disturbing and indeed most famous scene in the film,  allowing Richard's younger brother to drown in a lake. This last scene never fails to upset me when viewed and Gene Tierney is chillingly scary in the scene hidden as she is behind dark glasses while the boy is drowning in front of her.""Leave Her To Heaven"" benefits from some of the most lush cinematography of the mid 1940's and the beautiful colour used here adds greatly to the overrall look and feel of the production. Tierney is just right for the villianess role she plays here and her icy beauty, which is emphasised with the colour photography, along with her cold demeanour are just right for the role.In major supporting roles the earlier mentioned Vincent Price who was in ""laura"" with Tierney scores as the disgruntled ex-fiance and Jeanne Crain as Ellen's sister, and the object of her intense jealousy over her good relationship with Richard is also right on track. Mary Philips as Ellen's mother is also effective and gets to say probably the most famous line in the film when she states that ""There's nothing wrong with Ellen, she just happens to love too much"". Indeed loving too much is the basis for this whole story and is what brings the story to its tragic conclusion which finds Ellen killing herself when she realises that she has lost Richard for ever because of her actions.""Leave Her To Heaven"" is an absorbing melodrama of the first order and captures Gene Tierney at her most stunning and in this role at her most sinister. If you enjoy stories about people who are less than perfect ""Leave Her To Heaven"" will be a film that you will enjoy. Disturbing it certainly is but done with alot of professionalism and fine performances to make it very absorbing viewing.",5,Hypnotic look into the workings of a disturbed mind,1037836800,"11 21, 2002",2002,3178,"['Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'many', 'ways', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'unsettling', 'film', 'never', 'failing', 'intrigue', 'story', 'based', 'well', 'known', 'book', 'Ben', 'Ames', 'Williams', 'beautiful', 'quite', 'disturbed', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'everything', 'entirely', 'herself', 'matter', 'what', 'cost', 'have', 'probably', 'experienced', 'moments', 'possessiveness', 'lives', 'story', 'taken', 'extreme', 'ultimately', 'tragic', 'results.The', 'stunning', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'actresses', 'ever', 'grace', 'screen', 'was', 'reaching', 'peak', 'early', '1945', 'when', 'film', 'went', 'production', 'having', 'already', 'filmed', 'classic', 'Laura', 'two', 'years', 'earlier', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'got', 'one', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'playing', 'disturbed', 'manipulative', 'Ellen', 'Berent', 'priveledged', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'sight', 'something', 'never', 'up', 'obtained', 'instance', 'object', 'affection', 'Richard', 'Harland', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'successful', 'writer', 'who', 'train', 'later', 'marries', 'film', 'slow', 'descent', 'obsessive', 'need', 'keep', 'Richard', 'herself', 'expense', 'family', 'friends', 'even', 'human', 'life', 'psychopathic', 'need', 'keep', 'husband', 'herself', 'jilting', 'current', 'fiance', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'so', 'much', 'explanation', 'alienating', 'Richard', 'friend', 'Leick', 'Chill', 'Wills', 'deliberatly', 'loosing', 'unborn', 'baby', 'most', 'disturbing', 'indeed', 'most', 'famous', 'scene', 'film', 'allowing', 'Richard', 'younger', 'brother', 'drown', 'lake', 'last', 'scene', 'never', 'upset', 'when', 'viewed', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'chillingly', 'scary', 'scene', 'hidden', 'dark', 'glasses', 'boy', 'drowning', 'front', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'benefits', 'most', 'lush', 'cinematography', 'mid', '1940', 'beautiful', 'colour', 'used', 'here', 'greatly', 'overrall', 'look', 'feel', 'production', 'Tierney', 'just', 'right', 'villianess', 'role', 'here', 'icy', 'beauty', 'emphasised', 'colour', 'photography', 'cold', 'demeanour', 'are', 'just', 'right', 'role.In', 'major', 'supporting', 'earlier', 'mentioned', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'who', 'was', 'laura', 'Tierney', 'scores', 'disgruntled', 'ex-fiance', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'Ellen', 'sister', 'object', 'intense', 'jealousy', 'good', 'relationship', 'Richard', 'also', 'right', 'track', 'Mary', 'Philips', 'Ellen', 'mother', 'also', 'effective', 'say', 'probably', 'most', 'famous', 'line', 'film', 'when', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'Ellen', 'just', 'love', 'too', 'much', 'Indeed', 'loving', 'too', 'much', 'basis', 'whole', 'story', 'story', 'tragic', 'conclusion', 'Ellen', 'killing', 'when', 'lost', 'Richard', 'ever', 'actions', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'absorbing', 'melodrama', 'first', 'order', 'captures', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'most', 'stunning', 'role', 'most', 'sinister', 'enjoy', 'stories', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'less', 'perfect', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'will', 'be', 'film', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Disturbing', 'certainly', 'done', 'alot', 'professionalism', 'fine', 'performances', 'make', 'very', 'absorbing', 'viewing']",N/A

A smashing little thriller and a fine portrait of a woman who is a complete sociopath. Imagine my suprise that in all the world, Fox couldn't find two people who actually like the film to do the commentary track!  Most of the track is taken up by the non-stop whinings of Darryl Hickman, the then teen aged actor who played Danny.  He is currently a drama teacher who has discovered (I kid you not) ""the definitive acting style for the new millenium"", about which he is writing a book.  And apparently everyone comes up short against his high standards.  Gene Tierney was a lovely, troubled, cold stand-offish society woman of no discernible talent who telegraphs her technique.  Both Cornel Wilde and Jeanne Crain were lovely people of limited abilities.  Chill Wills was a personality and not an actor at all.  The actress who plays Gene and Jeanne's mother was a stage actress and far too mannered and ""internal"" (?), not ""in the moment"". Only Vincent Price escapes his wrath, and even then he unfavorably compares his looks to Cornell Wilde's. The director treated him abominably, constantly referring to him as, gasp, ""son"". In fact, he doesn't think there should be child actors at all since it's so abusive. It seems this guy thinks every bit of film acting prior to ""the method"" was irredeemable garbage and the only admirable thing about the film is the cinematography. The film obviously interrupted his high times with Liz and Roddy and Shirley and other heavily dropped names of the period. Sad sad bitter man. You and Jay North need to form a club. I hope you are enjoying putting your impeccable technique to work in the many fine community theatre productions that you feel superior while doing.Richard Schickel is better if repetitive with his discussion of Women's pictures other than the one he's reviewing.  He too does not seem overly enamored of the actors or their performances.  But, Oh, that cinematography!They should've let Scorsese do the track!

370757,A3M2WW0PO34B94,6303364772,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[11, 14]","""Leave Her To Heaven"" is a forgotten classic. Rarely shown on television, the film was recently released on DVD, in a stunning new restoration. Hopefully, this will introduce legions of new people to this forgotten Film Noir classic.Ellen Berent (Gene Tierney) and Richard Harland (Cornell Wilde) meet while traveling, on train, to a mutual friend's home in New Mexico. Ellen is caught staring at Richard and admits that he looks like her father. There, Richard learns that Ellen, her mother (Mary Philips) and her adopted sister, Ruth (Jeanne Crain) are there to distribute their father's ashes in the wild. During the stay, Ellen and Richard become more attracted to one another. Russell Quinton (Vincent Price), a District Attorney, shows up one rainy night, to demand that Ellen explain why she broke off their engagement. She states that she and Richard are going to be married, much to the surprise of Richard who agrees. Married life agrees with Richard and Ellen, until she begins to feel that people are distracting Richard from her. She wants his full and undivided attention and will do anything to get it.""Leave Her To Heaven"", directed by John Stahl, and released in 1945, was shot in Technicolor. Some may be surprised that I mentioned this was a Film Noir. Isn't all Film Noir in black and white? Well, no. Film Noir is more about the mood and the tone of the piece. Films like ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", ""Mildred Pierce"" and ""Double Indemnity"" feature people who are extremely unhappy with their current lives and will do anything to change that situation. They are desperate people. These films also happen to be filmed in black and white. ""Leave Her To Heaven"" is shot in Technicolor, in colors that are so rich, they resemble stained glass. The scenery in New Mexico and, later, Maine, is brought to vivid life with the rich, colorful hues. It also shows off Gene Tierney in all of her beauty.In ""Leave Her To Heaven"", we slowly realize that Ellen is also a desperate character. She has lost her father, someone she seems to have had an unnaturally close relationship with, and is, basically, looking for a replacement. For periods of time, she finds happiness. Initially, she is thrilled to be married to Richard. She then realizes that his brother, a sickly young man who is slowly learning to walk again, will draw Richard's attention away from her. How will she rectify that? She is initially thrilled when she becomes pregnant. Then she realizes that Ruth and Richard are spending a lot of time together. How will she rectify that?Why isn't this film better known? It seems strange that Gene Tierney and Cornell Wilde are all but forgotten today.Gene Tierney was one of the most beautiful actresses to shine on the silver screen. She also appeared in a handful of well-remembered films in the mid-forties. ""Dragonwyk"", ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" and ""Laura"" are probably her most recognized films. If we compare these films to, say, the best of Bette Davis, it is no contest. Bette Davis is, and should be, more well-remembered. I also find it odd that the gay community has not seemed to embrace her or ""Leave Her To Heaven"". Tierney is, at times, as campy as Joan Crawford or Bette Davis. IN an early scene, Ellen walks into a library wearing a white jumpsuit, with a sash around her waist, and an EB monogrammed into the top near her neck. The EB are done in floral script and form a sort of strap to hold the top to her neck. It is exactly the type of outfit that drag performers seem to love. In another scene, Ellen rides a horse back and forth through a small stretch of the New Mexico landscape, holding an open urn containing her father's ashes, waving it back and forth, as the ashes spread into the air. She stares straight ahead, her breasts jutting out in a tight sweater. ""Heaven"" is a hoot at times.Wilde was also a huge star in his day and seems to have been all but forgotten. In addition to ""Heaven"", he starred in ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", ""The Big Combo"" and one of the most memorable episodes of ""I Love Lucy""'s trip to Hollywood. A strapping Rock Hudson type, before there was Rock Hudson, he wasn't a great actor, but he was handsome, and made a suitable love interest.""Heaven"" is a fun movie to watch, because Ellen is so manipulative. Throughout her machinations, she comes up with devious ways to get what she wants. Sitting in a boat as her latest victim struggles, she sits silently, staring forward, her eyes dead. It is a chilling scene.""Leave Her To Heaven"" is one of the unsung film noir classics of Hollywood.

370758,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,6303364772,Turfseer,"[7, 14]","I recommend purchasing the DVD of ""Leave her to Heaven"" in order to listen to Darryl Hickman's recollections of working on the film as a 14 year old child actor, playing the part of Danny Harland, the crippled brother of the protagonist, Richard Harland (played by Cornel Wilde). Whether you agree or disagree with Hickman's comments, they remain fascinating and will give you insight into the making of this film.Hickman recalls that director John Stahl treated him very poorly halfway into the making of the film. In the most famous scene in the movie, where Gene Tierney's character Ellen, allows Danny Harland to drown in the lake, Hickman states that he was forced to shoot many takes of the scene, swimming in ice cold water and freezing cold temperature. It was so cold that Hickman's stunt double refused to shoot the scene and Hickman was forced to act in the scene himself. At one point, Hickman got a cramp in his leg and he sensed that he was beginning to drown; Stahl ignored Hickman's pleas but fortunately an assistant on the set realized that the kid might be in serious danger and pulled him out of the water. The scene in the lake took almost three weeks to shoot. Hickman says Tierney was completely cold to him and seemed to support Stahl in his lack of support of the sensitive child actor.Ironically, Stahl's attitude toward Hickman changed half way through the shooting of the picture. It seems that the producer, Darryl Zanuck, saw the rushes of the drowning scene and told Stahl that it was the most powerful scene he had ever seen in the movies. Stahl started to call Hickman by his first name and no longer referred to him as ""son"", which Hickman regarded as an insulting epithet. Now Stahl started to refer to Cornel Wilde as ""son"" and Hickman relates that the director treated Wilde very poorly throughout the rest of the filming of 'Leave her to Heaven'. In fact, Hickman maintains that Wilde told Stahl after filming was completed that he would never forget how Stahl mistreated him. And Hickman also maintains that Tierney treated Cornel Wilde quite coldly, always taking the director's side in his disparagement of Wilde.Hickman's claims that Tierney didn't think much of Wilde's acting abilities is borne out by Tierney's recollections in her autobiography, ""Self-Portrait"". Tierney refers to the scene in the library and writes: ""The scene was difficult for Cornel, who was meant to be weak and couldn't quite bring it off."" She adds that Stahl turned to Wilde at one point and said, ""They (referring to gaffers on the set) all seem to understand how the scene should be played, why can't you?"" Hickman felt that Tierney's abilities as an actor were limited. He felt she was an emotionally constricted person who couldn't open up to people in general. He's aware that Tierney later had to deal with bouts of mental illness but concedes he knows little of the details of her personal life. Tierney was a troubled person during her career as an actor which she readily admits in her autobiography. One important point that Hickman is apparently unaware of is that Tierney gave birth to a retarded child in 1943 which certainly had a deleterious effect on her mental health in later years.The conflict between Hickman and Tierney may have been simply due to the fact that Hickman needed more support since he was only 14 years old at the time he was working on the picture. Tierney on the other hand was probably more of a no-nonsense type who didn't believe in socializing while she was on the set.Leave her to Heaven was sumptuously filmed in the Technicolor of its day. The 2003 digital transfer restores the faded colors of an earlier print to the plush hues we see on the DVD today.The big problem with Leave her to Heaven is that the first half is all exposition. It's extremely slow-moving and we only get hints that something dramatic is going to happen. Finally, we're rewarded with the machinations of Tierney's evil Ellen Berent Harland in the second half. The high points come in spurts: Ellen sitting in the boat, casually doing nothing as Danny drowns; the shocking scene where she intentionally throws herself down the stairs in order to abort her unborn child and her grand exit where she commits suicide in order to facilitate her half-sister being charged with murder. Even today, those scenes pack an emotional wallop.Despite Ellen's gripping histrionics, the other principal characters played by Cornel Wilde and Jeanne Crain, the husband and the half-sister, fit the typical victim mold of melodrama and are too beatific and wooden to be considered at all compelling. Speaking of histrionics, Vincent Price is much too over the top as the District Attorney with his one-note (and much too angry) grilling of Cornel Wilde while he's on the stand in the courtroom.Finally I couldn't understand why Harland gets two years for ""withholding evidence"". It's inferred that the ""withholding of evidence"" occurred earlier in Harland's testimony when he fails to inform the court that Ellen stood by and let his brother drown. But where is the proof that Ellen actually did nothing? The court only had Richard's take on what had occurred and certainly that testimony is not backed up by any independent witnesses.Leave her to Heaven will be remembered for its stunning cinematography as well as its portrait of a demented 'femme fatale'. Aside from a few classic scenes, it's a film that plods along and only manages to capture your attention during its most salacious moments. Leave her to Heaven descends into the morass of victim-hood, suggesting that there is only good and evil in the world and no shades of gray.",2,Good and evil with no shades of gray,1236988800,"03 14,

370759,AQP1VPK16SVWM,6303364772,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[7, 7]","A fascinating film noir suspense thriller that's part of Fox's Academy Awards series of DVD releases (the film won for its beautiful color cinematography by Leon Shamroy), ""Leave Her to Heaven"" was one of the earliest (and rare) film noirs in color. Writer Richard Harland (Cornel Wilde) meets Ellen Berent (Gene Tierney) on a train (shades of ""Strangers on a Train""!) to Maine. He falls in love with her and marries her. Shortly after their marriage a number of tragedies happen to Harland including the death of his brother and the loss of his son. Soon Harland begins to suspect that his wife may be mentally unbalanced and is behind these deaths.Featuring a wonderful restoration by Fox, ""Leave Her to Heaven"" looks positively yummy with the deep, rich Technicolor hues so common to films of the period. A comparison between an earlier film transfer demonstrates the amount of work that went into cleaning up the print, enhancing the fading color from the negative and improving the clarity and sharpness of the images. The  soundtrack has also been restored with a nice stereo mix of the original sound elements (you can hear the original mono mix by for comparison sake on a second audio track).We get two brief Movietone newsreels concerning the premiere of the movie with lots of shots of stars from the era and a staged sequence where the Academy Awards are presented to winners for their Fox films by Bob Hope. There's also the original theatrical trailer and a restoration comparison giving the viewer an ideas as to how much work went into color correcting and improving the image.We get an audio commentary by child actor Darryl Hickman who appeared in the film and Film Critic Richard Schnickel from Time Magazine. It's clear that the two were recorded separately as there isn't any interaction which is too bad as I think Hickman's rambling (but interesting) commentary would have benefited from Schnickel's knowledgeable questions about the era and the film. Hickman comments on everything from growing up as a child actor in Hollywood (including telling us about his friendship with the late Roddy MacDowall, Elizabeth Taylor and Shirley Temple), working on the movie,  his first date (arranged by his best friend MacDowall because Hickman was too shy to ask Elizabeth Taylor himself) and working with the various producers/directors throughout his career. Schnickel's comments range from a discussion of the actors in the film and their careers (his observations about Cornel Wilde are particularly interesting. His comments about Wilde's ""innocence"" as an actor and how that also benefited the unusual movies he directed later including ""The Naked Prey"" are also quite interesting) and the trials that Academy Award winning actress Gene Tierney (best known for the film ""Laura"") faced when she suffered from depression and sought shock treatment in the 50's are also quite insightful.A terrific vintage film noir with beautiful cinematography, strong performances and a great commentary track, ""Leave Her to Heaven"" continues to work as a thriller because of the great screenplay by Jo Swerling (""Guys & Dolls"", ""Lifeboat"") and the sharp direction of John M. Stahl (""Imitation of Life"", ""Magnificent Obession"", ""The Keys of the Kingdom""). The strong performances by Tierney and the supporting cast make this vivid film noir successful.",4,Classic color film noir arrives on DVD looking great,1108252800,"02 13, 2005",2005,3354,"['fascinating', 'film', 'noir', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'part', 'Fox', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'series', 'DVD', 'releases', 'film', 'won', 'beautiful', 'color', 'cinematography', 'Leon', 'Shamroy', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'was', 'one', 'earliest', 'rare', 'film', 'noirs', 'color', 'Writer', 'Richard', 'Harland', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'Ellen', 'Berent', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'train', 'shades', 'Strangers', 'Train', 'Maine', 'love', 'Shortly', 'marriage', 'number', 'tragedies', 'happen', 'Harland', 'including', 'death', 'brother', 'loss', 'son', 'Soon', 'Harland', 'suspect', 'wife', 'may', 'be', 'mentally', 'unbalanced', 'deaths.Featuring', 'wonderful', 'restoration', 'Fox', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'positively', 'yummy', 'deep', 'rich', 'Technicolor', 'hues', 'so', 'common', 'films', 'period', 'comparison', 'earlier', 'film', 'transfer', 'amount', 'work', 'went', 'cleaning', 'up', 'print', 'enhancing', 'fading', 'color', 'negative', 'improving', 'clarity', 'sharpness', 'images', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'been', 'restored', 'nice', 'stereo', 'mix', 'original', 'sound', 'elements', 'can', 'hear', 'original', 'mono', 'mix', 'comparison', 'sake', 'second', 'audio', 'track', 'get', 'two', 'brief', 'Movietone', 'newsreels', 'concerning', 'premiere', 'movie', 'lots', 'shots', 'stars', 'era', 'staged', 'sequence', 'where', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'are', 'presented', 'winners', 'Fox', 'films', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'also', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'restoration', 'comparison', 'giving', 'viewer', 'ideas', 'how', 'much', 'work', 'went', 'color', 'correcting', 'improving', 'image.We', 'get', 'audio', 'commentary', 'child', 'actor', 'Darryl', 'Hickman', 'who', 'appeared', 'film', 'Film', 'Critic', 'Richard', 'Schnickel', 'Time', 'Magazine', 'clear', 'two', 'were', 'recorded', 'separately', ""n't"", 'interaction', 'too', 'bad', 'think', 'Hickman', 'rambling', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'Schnickel', 'knowledgeable', 'questions', 'era', 'film', 'Hickman', 'comments', 'everything', 'growing', 'up', 'child', 'actor', 'Hollywood', 'including', 'telling', 'friendship', 'late', 'Roddy', 'MacDowall', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'working', 'movie', 'first', 'date', 'arranged', 'best', 'friend', 'MacDowall', 'Hickman', 'was', 'too', 'shy', 'ask', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'working', 'various', 'producers/directors', 'career', 'Schnickel', 'comments', 'range', 'discussion', 'actors', 'film', 'careers', 'observations', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'are', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'comments', 'Wilde', 'innocence', 'actor', 'how', 'also', 'benefited', 'unusual', 'movies', 'directed', 'later', 'including', 'Naked', 'Prey', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'interesting', 'trials', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'actress', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'best', 'known', 'film', 'Laura', 'faced', 'when', 'suffered', 'depression', 'sought', 'shock', 'treatment', '50', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'insightful.A', 'terrific', 'vintage', 'film', 'noir', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'strong', 'performances', 'great', 'commentary', 'track', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'work', 'thriller', 'great', 'screenplay', 'Jo', 'Swerling', 'Guys', 'Dolls', 'Lifeboat', 'sharp', 'direction', 'John', 'M.', 'Stahl', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'Magnificent', 'Obession', 'Keys', 'Kingdom', 'strong', 'performances', 'Tierney', 'supporting', 'cast', 'make', 'vivid', 'film', 'noir', 'successful']",N/A
