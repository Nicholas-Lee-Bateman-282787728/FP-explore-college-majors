Johnson,"[3, 12]","How can a guy like Tyler Perry who creates such beautiful and captivating motion pictures stoop to such a low as what he does for TBS with this terrible show. It's hard to even crack a smile at the stupid happenings that go on during the show. This show isn't real life. It's like a whole bunch of former drug addicts that get together and yell a lot with audience applause everywhere throughout. By the way, this applause and laughter happens at all the wrong places. Think about when someone says something not funny when they're trying to be and you look at the person next to you with a really confused look.....this is ""House of Payne"". If you're looking for entertainment stick to Perry's movies, which are wonderful. Hopefully this 100 episode contract he has with TBS will run out soon so we don't have to see the commercials promoting it any more either.",1,Tyler Perry's Downfall,1233014400,"01 27, 2009",2009,863,"['How', 'can', 'guy', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'who', 'such', 'beautiful', 'captivating', 'motion', 'pictures', 'stoop', 'low', 'what', 'TBS', 'terrible', 'show', 'hard', 'even', 'crack', 'smile', 'stupid', 'happenings', 'go', 'show', 'show', ""n't"", 'real', 'life', 'whole', 'bunch', 'former', 'drug', 'addicts', 'get', 'together', 'yell', 'lot', 'audience', 'applause', 'everywhere', 'way', 'applause', 'laughter', 'happens', 'wrong', 'places', 'Think', 'when', 'someone', 'something', 'not', 'funny', 'when', ""'re"", 'trying', 'be', 'look', 'person', 'next', 'really', 'confused', 'look', '..this', 'House', 'Payne', ""'re"", 'looking', 'entertainment', 'stick', 'Perry', 'movies', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Hopefully', '100', 'episode', 'contract', 'TBS', 'will', 'run', 'out', 'soon', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'commercials', 'promoting', 'more']",N/A
