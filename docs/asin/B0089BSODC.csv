The doll was custom made to look as much like the daughter, as possible.  Only, the doll has a &#34;bad soul&#34; and tries to take over.  Very entertaining and just scary enough for both adults and a younger audience.  A story that has been done before, but with some interesting twists.

Well, his new series The Haunting Hour debuted in 2010 on The Hub cable channel based upon his The Haunting Hour book, a collection of short stories.I've been a die-hard R.L. Stine fan since I was a kid, but I don't get The Hub channel, so I patiently waited for the DVDs to be released! The Haunting Hour follows the typical 22 minutes length per episode, but unlike the Goosebumps series, this series has a bigger budget and better acting. The special effects are much better this time around and the stories are much darker.In the two-part premiere Really You, Lilly (played by Bailee Madison) is a spoiled girl, always getting what she wants from her parents, especially from her dear old dad. What she wants now is the Really You life-size doll, in which her parents give in and get it for her. Strange things begin happening and Lilly suspects her doll is responsible. Her mother starts acting strange and becomes obsessed with the doll. Lilly realizes that this doll may want to actually become her.The Creature Was Stirring is set during Christmas and involves a family that is on the blink of destruction. The two older kids are greedy and are upset because they didn't get the right presents. Their parents are ready to divorce. Young Timmy sends a letter to Santa asking for help. Suddenly, a snow storm traps them inside the house and a strange gift is left for Timmy. The gift is a gremlin. The family must band together if they want to survive Christmas!Will is bulled by two teenagers in The Dead Body, which makes the episode all too real. He meets a new student named Jake, who promises to help him get back at the bullies. One of the bullies drops out school because he is too scared to return. Will finds out that Jake may have actually died in the 1950s and has come back as a ghost.After her father's recent death, Jillian's mother drags her away from her home and moves her to their new life - running an Inn. As soon as they arrive, Jillian begins having strange dreams and then the necklace that her father had gave her goes missing! The two young staffers at the Inn are acting odd and they may be creatures of the night.I flew right through these five episodes. I was surprised that the acting wasn't that bad compared to the old Goosebumps television series. The production values were impressive for a kids show. Unlike Goosebumps, the parents of the kids actually have something to do with the plots. The stories are much darker, but not too dark. The DVD, along with Volume 2, is coming out just in time for the Halloween season.",5,Five Episodes to Give You Goosebumps!,1346889600,"09 6, 2012",2012,2660,"['Do', 'remember', 'Goosebumps', 'books', 'TV', 'series', '1990s', 'horror', 'mastermind', 'R.L', 'Stine', 'Well', 'new', 'series', 'Haunting', 'Hour', 'debuted', '2010', 'Hub', 'cable', 'channel', 'based', 'Haunting', 'Hour', 'book', 'collection', 'short', 'stories.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'die-hard', 'R.L', 'Stine', 'fan', 'was', 'kid', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Hub', 'channel', 'patiently', 'waited', 'DVDs', 'be', 'released', 'Haunting', 'Hour', 'typical', '22', 'minutes', 'length', 'episode', 'Goosebumps', 'series', 'series', 'bigger', 'budget', 'better', 'acting', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'time', 'around', 'stories', 'are', 'much', 'two-part', 'premiere', 'Really', 'Lilly', 'played', 'Bailee', 'Madison', 'spoiled', 'girl', 'always', 'getting', 'what', 'parents', 'especially', 'dear', 'old', 'dad', 'What', 'now', 'Really', 'life-size', 'doll', 'parents', 'give', 'get', 'Strange', 'things', 'begin', 'happening', 'Lilly', 'doll', 'responsible', 'mother', 'acting', 'strange', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'doll', 'Lilly', 'doll', 'may', 'want', 'actually', 'become', 'her.The', 'Creature', 'Was', 'Stirring', 'set', 'Christmas', 'family', 'blink', 'destruction', 'two', 'older', 'kids', 'are', 'greedy', 'are', 'upset', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'right', 'presents', 'parents', 'are', 'ready', 'divorce', 'Young', 'Timmy', 'letter', 'Santa', 'asking', 'help', 'Suddenly', 'snow', 'storm', 'house', 'strange', 'gift', 'left', 'Timmy', 'gift', 'gremlin', 'family', 'must', 'band', 'together', 'want', 'survive', 'Christmas', 'Will', 'bulled', 'two', 'teenagers', 'Dead', 'Body', 'episode', 'too', 'real', 'new', 'student', 'named', 'Jake', 'who', 'help', 'get', 'back', 'bullies', 'One', 'bullies', 'out', 'school', 'too', 'scared', 'return', 'Will', 'out', 'Jake', 'may', 'have', 'actually', 'died', '1950s', 'come', 'back', 'ghost.After', 'father', 'recent', 'death', 'Jillian', 'mother', 'away', 'home', 'new', 'life', 'running', 'Inn', 'As', 'soon', 'arrive', 'Jillian', 'having', 'strange', 'dreams', 'then', 'necklace', 'father', 'had', 'gave', 'missing', 'two', 'young', 'staffers', 'Inn', 'are', 'acting', 'odd', 'may', 'be', 'creatures', 'night.I', 'flew', 'right', 'five', 'episodes', 'was', 'surprised', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'compared', 'old', 'Goosebumps', 'television', 'series', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'impressive', 'kids', 'show', 'Goosebumps', 'parents', 'kids', 'actually', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'plots', 'stories', 'are', 'much', 'darker', 'not', 'too', 'dark', 'DVD', 'Volume', '2', 'coming', 'out', 'just', 'time', 'Halloween', 'season']",N/A

However, THE HAUNTING HOUR is much darker in tone and content and the production values are a couple notches above those of GOOSEBUMPS. Volume 1 contains five episodes from the series. Each episode is about 22 minutes in length, including the show intro and the credits. The episodes are:""Really You, Parts 1 & 2"" - Lilly is a spoiled girl who has always gotten everything she wants and has her father wrapped around her finger. Her latest request and gift is a special life-sized ""Really You"" doll. The doll Lilly receives is named Lilly D. Lilly D looks like a giant plastic replica of Lilly herself. At first, Lilly fawns all over the doll. Her parents buy matching clothes for Lilly and Lilly D. Lilly's spoiled behavior worsens as she flaunts her new found ""wealth"" at her friends. But then, Lilly is informed that Lilly D doesn't like her and some strange shenanigans start to happen and Lilly is convinced that Lilly D is alive. Lilly gets in trouble and it becomes apparent that something strange is happening between Lilly and Lilly D.""The Dead Body"" - Will is constantly bullied by a couple of older kids in high school. Then he meets a new student named Jake who agrees to help Will get even with the bullies. In exchange, Will is supposed to help him when he needs it. Will agrees, but learns that Jake isn't exactly the person he appears to be.""The Creature Was Stirring"" - this episode first aired on Christmas Day (2010). It's set on Christmas. A young boy, Timmy, wrote Santa a letter and hopes that Santa will grant his request. Timmy's older brother and sister are constantly on their phones and playing with electronics. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the children, Timmy's parents are discussing getting a divorce. The day of peace, love, and joy turns bitter when the parents take away the kids cell phones and then end up arguing with each other in the kitchen. Meanwhile, Timmy finds one last present hidden beneath the tree after a freak snowstorm blows open the front door. Timmy's not sure what's in the package but when he opens it, he discovers a gremlin (the flying kind that pilots used to talk about). The little monster starts eating electronics and destroying things in the house. It begins attacking the family members one by one and it soon becomes clear that in order to defeat the creature, they are going to have to band together.""Nightmare Inn"" - Jillian is traveling to visit a small Inn that her mother is preparing to purchase. Jillian's father died while traveling to check out the Inn sometime (several months) before and was apparently killed when his car swerved off a curve and flew off a cliff, but his body was never found. Jillian has had nightmares about the place ever since. Still, the Inn is Jillian's mother's dream. They arrive at the Inn and are startled by one of the caretakers. The woman appears pleasant, but acts rather strange. The next day, Jillian meets another one of the staffers, a mysterious and attractive boy named Caleb who acts almost as strange as Jillian. There's just something wrong with the cozy, little Inn and Jillian's nightmares just might turn out to be premonitions.It's quite easy to watch R.L. STINE'S THE HAUNTING HOUR: THE SERIES, VOL. 1. I watched them back to back with my sister and including the extras, we watched the whole disc in about ninety minutes and were ready for more. The acting is actually quite good for a half-hour tv show aimed at teenagers. As mentioned before, the production values are much better than GOOSEBUMPS; the cheap rubber masks that were often used in GOOSEBUMPS are gone and replaced by much more realistic and life-like make-up. Also, unlike many of the GOOSEBUMPS stories, parents are present and often critical to the plot. I enjoyed each of the episodes of this collection, but I was disappointed by ""The Dead Body."" This story really does end in a horrifying matter and unlike the other episodes on the disc, there is no moral and good doesn't conquer evil. Personally, I think it's worth owning this disc solely for ""The Creature Was Stirring""; it's one of the few episodes that ends humorously.The only extras include a quick behind the scenes look of  ""Really You, Part 1 & 2"" and ""The Body"" and the original tv trailer for the series.",5,Beyond GOOSEBUMPS,1348358400,"09 23, 2012",2012,4443,"['Inspired', 'couple', 'short', 'story', 'collections', 'HAUNTING', 'HOUR', 'NIGHTMARE', 'HOUR', 'R.L.Stine', 'THE', 'HAUNTING', 'HOUR', 'SERIES', 'similar', 'Stine', 'mid-1990', 'series', 'GOOSEBUMPS', 'However', 'THE', 'HAUNTING', 'HOUR', 'much', 'darker', 'tone', 'content', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'couple', 'notches', 'GOOSEBUMPS', 'Volume', '1', 'contains', 'five', 'episodes', 'series', 'episode', '22', 'minutes', 'length', 'including', 'show', 'intro', 'credits', 'episodes', 'are', 'Really', '1', '2', 'Lilly', 'spoiled', 'girl', 'who', 'always', 'gotten', 'everything', 'father', 'wrapped', 'finger', 'latest', 'request', 'gift', 'special', 'life-sized', 'Really', 'doll', 'doll', 'Lilly', 'named', 'Lilly', 'D.', 'Lilly', 'D', 'giant', 'plastic', 'replica', 'Lilly', 'first', 'Lilly', 'fawns', 'doll', 'parents', 'buy', 'matching', 'clothes', 'Lilly', 'Lilly', 'D.', 'Lilly', 'spoiled', 'behavior', 'worsens', 'new', 'found', 'wealth', 'friends', 'then', 'Lilly', 'informed', 'Lilly', 'D', ""n't"", 'like', 'strange', 'shenanigans', 'start', 'happen', 'Lilly', 'convinced', 'Lilly', 'D', 'alive', 'Lilly', 'trouble', 'apparent', 'something', 'strange', 'happening', 'Lilly', 'Lilly', 'D.', 'Dead', 'Body', 'Will', 'constantly', 'bullied', 'couple', 'older', 'kids', 'high', 'school', 'Then', 'new', 'student', 'named', 'Jake', 'who', 'help', 'Will', 'get', 'even', 'bullies', 'exchange', 'Will', 'supposed', 'help', 'when', 'Will', 'Jake', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'person', 'be', 'Creature', 'Was', 'Stirring', 'episode', 'first', 'aired', 'Christmas', 'Day', '2010', 'set', 'Christmas', 'A', 'young', 'boy', 'Timmy', 'wrote', 'Santa', 'letter', 'Santa', 'will', 'grant', 'request', 'Timmy', 'older', 'brother', 'sister', 'are', 'constantly', 'phones', 'playing', 'electronics', 'Meanwhile', 'unbeknownst', 'children', 'Timmy', 'parents', 'are', 'discussing', 'getting', 'divorce', 'day', 'peace', 'love', 'joy', 'turns', 'bitter', 'when', 'parents', 'take', 'away', 'kids', 'cell', 'phones', 'then', 'end', 'up', 'arguing', 'other', 'kitchen', 'Meanwhile', 'Timmy', 'one', 'last', 'present', 'hidden', 'beneath', 'tree', 'freak', 'snowstorm', 'open', 'front', 'door', 'Timmy', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'package', 'when', 'gremlin', 'flying', 'kind', 'pilots', 'used', 'talk', 'little', 'monster', 'eating', 'electronics', 'destroying', 'things', 'house', 'attacking', 'family', 'members', 'one', 'one', 'soon', 'clear', 'order', 'defeat', 'creature', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'band', 'together', 'Nightmare', 'Inn', 'Jillian', 'traveling', 'visit', 'small', 'Inn', 'mother', 'preparing', 'purchase', 'Jillian', 'father', 'died', 'traveling', 'check', 'out', 'Inn', 'sometime', 'several', 'months', 'was', 'apparently', 'killed', 'when', 'car', 'swerved', 'off', 'curve', 'flew', 'cliff', 'body', 'was', 'never', 'found', 'Jillian', 'had', 'nightmares', 'place', 'ever', 'Still', 'Inn', 'Jillian', 'mother', 'dream', 'arrive', 'Inn', 'are', 'startled', 'one', 'caretakers', 'woman', 'pleasant', 'rather', 'strange', 'next', 'day', 'Jillian', 'one', 'staffers', 'mysterious', 'attractive', 'boy', 'named', 'Caleb', 'who', 'almost', 'as', 'strange', 'Jillian', 'just', 'something', 'wrong', 'cozy', 'little', 'Inn', 'Jillian', 'nightmares', 'just', 'might', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'premonitions.It', 'quite', 'easy', 'watch', 'R.L', 'STINE', 'THE', 'HAUNTING', 'HOUR', 'SERIES', 'VOL', '1', 'watched', 'back', 'back', 'sister', 'including', 'extras', 'watched', 'whole', 'disc', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'were', 'ready', 'more', 'acting', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'half-hour', 'tv', 'show', 'aimed', 'teenagers', 'mentioned', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'GOOSEBUMPS', 'cheap', 'rubber', 'masks', 'were', 'often', 'used', 'GOOSEBUMPS', 'are', 'gone', 'replaced', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'life-like', 'make-up', 'Also', 'many', 'GOOSEBUMPS', 'stories', 'parents', 'are', 'present', 'often', 'critical', 'plot', 'enjoyed', 'episodes', 'collection', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Dead', 'Body', 'story', 'really', 'end', 'horrifying', 'matter', 'other', 'episodes', 'disc', 'moral', 'good', ""n't"", 'conquer', 'evil', 'Personally', 'think', 'worth', 'owning', 'disc', 'solely', 'Creature', 'Was', 'Stirring', 'one', 'few', 'episodes', 'only', 'include', 'quick', 'scenes', 'look', 'Really', 'Part', '1', '2', 'Body', 'original', 'tv', 'trailer', 'series']",N/A

This is Volume One of The Haunting Hour series and contains four episodes, one of which is shown in two parts:Really You (Parts 1 and 2) - a spoiled young girl (portrayed by Bailee Madison) demands her father buy her a life-sized doll to be a companion/friend. When the doll arrives, the girl finds her life turned topsy turvy as the doll harbors an evil agenda that could place the girl's very life at stake.The Dead Body - a teenager finds school life a living hell when he is the target of bullies. Then he meets a mysterious new kid who promises to get even with the bullies on his behalf. Little does the boy know that the new kid isn't what he appears to be and that payment for services rendered might be a little too costly!A Creature Was Stirring - Timmy gets a Christmas present that turns out to be a gremlin like creature. Will this be the end of Timmy or could something good possibly come out of this?Nightmare Inn - a teen girl and her mother move to an inn they recently purchased to start afresh after the devastating death of the girl's father.
