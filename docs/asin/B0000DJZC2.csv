Even if you dislike Ashton Kutcher (and I'm somewhere in the middle on that one- will always love his role in That 70's Show at least) he's not really the one responsible for the laughs in the movie.  It's more like Ashton's always around when something crazy happens.It's about Ashton staying the night at his boss's house all in an attempt to win over his *extremely* attractive daughter played by Tara Reid.  Well what happens is that... Ashton finds himself involved in SEVERAL crazy antics.  One thing leads to another and suddenly Ashton has more on his plate than he can handle.  Ashton himself is only funny once in a great while- it's the *other* characters and in particular the well-told storyline that makes the movie so memorable for me.  Ashton has to make sure his boss's house remains intact and nothing gets out of hand.  Well... too late there!To give a few examples.  The boss has a pet owl that gets into his own adventures involving needing medication and escaping the house all as a means to create more anxiety for Ashton Kutcher, a drug dealer roams through the house searching for drugs while Ashton tries to stop the man, the boss's secretary comes over to visit, several other people come over to visit and wreck the house in the most careless way imaginable, Ashton finds himself visiting the neighbors house when the owl escapes and subsequently becomes involved in *more* unintentional adventures concerning a new set of characters, Ashton and several of his ""friends"" are eventually surrounded in a murder cover-up, etc.  I'm basically only describing the tip of the iceberg here- this movie has so much depth that rewatching the film a few more times is almost mandatory in order to absorb all the jokes.  This storyline flows well, but it's really *fast*.Yes this movie is utterly silly but good writing and comedy can't be ignored which this movie delivers in spades.  I find myself disagreeing with people quite often.  In this case, most of the reviewers here on amazon must not have the same type of humor as me.  I enjoy it.  I believe anyone who appreciates Leslie Nielsen will love this movie.  Similar type of clever laughs.

But I gave ""Marci X"" three stars and ""My Boss's Daughter,"" five stars, so I guess you can see which I thought was the better movie. You can call me crazy because I liked this movie, but I just thought that it was really funny, which is what I like to look for. A movie does not have to be emotional or touching to be good. As long as I am entertained in the movie theatre, and laugh and if the movie calls for emotion they if I can feel for the characters I will think that its a good movie. This movie however, was very funny. It had stupid humor, and most of the time, that is all that I am looking for in a movie anyway.The story of ""My Boss's Daughter,"" is a simple on at most. No biggie. Tom works as a reasearcher in a publishers houserun by Jack who is known for firing people for making a bad cup of coffee. That is exactly what Tom's fellow co-worker Audrey does. Tom is very nervous about asking his boss for a promotion in the creative department, and he is also nervous about asking out his beautiful daughter and co-worker Lisa.(Played by Tara Reid who I never really liked.) Tom thinks that Lisa is asking him out when it seems that she is asking him to a party, but she really just wants him to housesit in place of her, so that she could go to a party. Jack is waiting for him at the house and tells him the rules. He also tells him how to feed his precious bird O.J. Tom says ""No problem,"" but thinks go wrong when everybody leaves. Audrey comes by to talk to Jack and then Lisa's brother Red comes to ask Tom to give a package to T.J. The package is drugs. But then tons of other people arrive at the house including Speed and Tina. Tom is scared because when Jack left the house he said that if anything was wrong he would fire Tom and kill him. As he tries to get everybody out of the house, he runs into Lisa's boyfriend Hans, a women who thinks that Tom is her date, and is offended because she has a large headwound, and O.J. who escapes from his cage. ""My Boss's Daughter,"" is a very funny movie that was just misunderstood.""My Boss's Daughter,"" got such bad box office buzz that it wasn't even previewed in advance by critics. I still stand by the theory that the reason movies that were shot down by critics do bad, were because people were told that they were bad. I think that that is the case with ""My Boss's Daughter."" I thought that this was a very funny piece of comedy. It was also dark, I feel. I love dark comedy. Some of my favorite dark movies are ""Death to Smoochy,"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" But ""My Boss's Daughter,"" is a different work of dark comedy. It is a dark comedy disguised as a comedy. It wasn't billed as one, but I think it should be. It had comedy about death, drugs, and murderers. But I thought it was a great film and the DVD is out soon.ENJOY!Rated PG-13 for crude and sex-related humor, drug content and language.",5,A Great Comedy!,1074643200,"01 21, 2004",2004,2956,"['was', 'either', 'seeing', 'Marci', 'X', 'ended', 'up', 'seeing', 'anyway', 'gave', 'Marci', 'X', 'three', 'stars', 'Boss', 'Daughter', 'five', 'stars', 'guess', 'can', 'see', 'thought', 'was', 'better', 'movie', 'can', 'call', 'crazy', 'liked', 'movie', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'funny', 'what', 'like', 'look', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'emotional', 'touching', 'be', 'good', 'As', 'long', 'am', 'entertained', 'movie', 'theatre', 'laugh', 'movie', 'emotion', 'can', 'feel', 'characters', 'will', 'think', 'good', 'movie', 'movie', 'however', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'had', 'stupid', 'humor', 'most', 'time', 'am', 'looking', 'movie', 'anyway.The', 'story', 'My', 'Boss', 'Daughter', 'simple', 'most', 'biggie', 'Tom', 'reasearcher', 'publishers', 'houserun', 'Jack', 'who', 'known', 'firing', 'people', 'making', 'bad', 'cup', 'coffee', 'exactly', 'what', 'Tom', 'fellow', 'co-worker', 'Audrey', 'Tom', 'very', 'nervous', 'asking', 'boss', 'promotion', 'creative', 'department', 'also', 'nervous', 'asking', 'out', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'co-worker', 'Lisa', 'Played', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'Tom', 'Lisa', 'asking', 'out', 'when', 'asking', 'party', 'really', 'just', 'housesit', 'place', 'could', 'go', 'party', 'Jack', 'waiting', 'house', 'rules', 'also', 'how', 'feed', 'precious', 'bird', 'O.J', 'Tom', 'No', 'problem', 'go', 'wrong', 'when', 'everybody', 'Audrey', 'talk', 'Jack', 'then', 'Lisa', 'brother', 'Red', 'ask', 'Tom', 'give', 'package', 'T.J', 'package', 'drugs', 'then', 'tons', 'other', 'people', 'arrive', 'house', 'including', 'Speed', 'Tina', 'Tom', 'scared', 'when', 'Jack', 'left', 'house', 'said', 'anything', 'was', 'wrong', 'would', 'fire', 'Tom', 'kill', 'get', 'everybody', 'house', 'Lisa', 'boyfriend', 'Hans', 'women', 'who', 'Tom', 'date', 'offended', 'large', 'headwound', 'O.J', 'who', 'cage', 'Boss', 'Daughter', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'misunderstood', 'Boss', 'Daughter', 'got', 'such', 'bad', 'box', 'office', 'buzz', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'previewed', 'advance', 'critics', 'still', 'stand', 'theory', 'reason', 'movies', 'were', 'shot', 'down', 'critics', 'do', 'bad', 'were', 'people', 'were', 'told', 'were', 'bad', 'think', 'case', 'Boss', 'Daughter', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'piece', 'comedy', 'was', 'also', 'dark', 'feel', 'love', 'dark', 'comedy', 'favorite', 'dark', 'movies', 'are', 'Death', 'Smoochy', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'Boss', 'Daughter', 'different', 'work', 'dark', 'comedy', 'dark', 'comedy', 'disguised', 'comedy', 'was', ""n't"", 'billed', 'one', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'had', 'comedy', 'death', 'drugs', 'murderers', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'DVD', 'out', 'soon.ENJOY', 'Rated', 'PG-13', 'crude', 'sex-related', 'humor', 'drug', 'content', 'language']",N/A

At least what I sat through was the R rated edition of &quot;My Boss's Daughter,&quot; which means either they put the good parts back in after Hollywood forced director David Zucker to make unwarranted cuts (half full theory) or they had no where to go so any changes were for the best (half empty theory).  Zucker might have been the director of this film, but instead of recalling &quot;Airplane&quot; or &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; all this film made me think was that apparently not everybody can pull off what the Farrelly Brothers have been doing in their raunchy comedies.  The creidt, or lack thereof, clearly falls to writer David Dorfman, but Zucker should have recognized how insipid this script was right away.  Star Ashton Kutcher got a credit as co-producer of this film; he should see about giving it back.This 2003 film has a strong opening and closing because we have the Barenaked Ladies singing &quot;If I Had a Million Dollars.&quot;  Unfortunately what we are treated to in the film ends up being the bare naked rear ends of Terrence Stamp and Andy Richter, although there is the obligatory Carmen Electra in a wet t-shirt sequence.  The plot (actually it is more of a situation) is that nice guy Tom Stansfield (Kutcher) thinks he is being asked to a party by Lisa (Tara Reid) the daughter of his boss, Jack Taylor (Terence Stamp).  Instead he is going to be house sitting...for the evening.  Right away that should tell you this film is heading in the wrong direction.  Tom is given careful instructions by his boss, which basically sets up everything that will go wrong in the next hour all because he cannot stop any of the growing assortment of oddball characters who show up from entering the house or get any of them to leave.  Included in this group are Richter as Lisa's trouble brother, Michael Madsen as a thug named T.J. in a testimonial to have far his career has gone downhill since &quot;Reservoir Dogs,&quot; and Molly Shannon as the fired secretary who will not go away.The DVD extras are interesting because they show us that this film could have been even worse.  You have to click on Simon to find it, but there is a video version of a key scene near the end of the film that Zucker made to convince the studio to let him film it for real.  In a sense it was the one scene that sort of redeemed the film, at least on one level, so leaving it out of the equation would have made of &quot;My Boss's Daughter&quot; even more laughable (but in a bad way).  The person who is most wasted in this film is Stamp, who steals all of the early scenes and then gets reduced to be the butt of jokes at the end (sorry, my resistance is down to such quips at this point).  Kutcher is essentially playing the straight man here, so he really does nothing offensive, just watches everybody else try to tank their careers.  Is there a message buried in this film?  I mean, besides the importance of regular breast exams to check for lumps?  Sure: love your kids more than your bird.  Apparently some people do not know this so this film will be news for them.  Next week we are going to try and sit through &quot;Gigli.&quot;  I cannot possibly believe that it could be worse than this film.",2,You're in trouble if you like the humor in this sad film,1079049600,"03 12, 2004",2004,3434,"['want', 'point', 'out', 'true', 'wife', 'gotten', 'up', 'walked', 'out', 'last', 'couple', 'DVDs', 'have', 'rented', 'watch', 'one', 'who', 'picked', 'evening', 'fare', 'last', 'couple', 'nights', 'least', 'what', 'sat', 'was', 'R', 'rated', 'edition', 'quot', 'My', 'Boss', 'Daughter', 'quot', 'put', 'good', 'parts', 'back', 'Hollywood', 'forced', 'director', 'David', 'Zucker', 'make', 'unwarranted', 'cuts', 'half', 'full', 'theory', 'had', 'where', 'go', 'so', 'changes', 'were', 'best', 'half', 'empty', 'theory', 'Zucker', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'director', 'film', 'instead', 'recalling', 'quot', 'Airplane', 'quot', 'quot', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'quot', 'film', 'made', 'think', 'was', 'apparently', 'not', 'everybody', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'what', 'Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'raunchy', 'comedies', 'creidt', 'lack', 'thereof', 'clearly', 'writer', 'David', 'Dorfman', 'Zucker', 'should', 'have', 'recognized', 'how', 'insipid', 'script', 'was', 'right', 'away', 'Star', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'got', 'credit', 'co-producer', 'film', 'should', 'see', 'giving', 'back.This', '2003', 'film', 'strong', 'opening', 'closing', 'have', 'Barenaked', 'Ladies', 'singing', 'quot', 'Had', 'Million', 'Dollars.', 'quot', 'Unfortunately', 'what', 'are', 'treated', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'bare', 'naked', 'rear', 'ends', 'Terrence', 'Stamp', 'Andy', 'Richter', 'obligatory', 'Carmen', 'Electra', 'wet', 't-shirt', 'sequence', 'plot', 'actually', 'more', 'situation', 'nice', 'guy', 'Tom', 'Stansfield', 'Kutcher', 'being', 'asked', 'party', 'Lisa', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'daughter', 'boss', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'Instead', 'going', 'be', 'house', 'sitting', 'evening', 'Right', 'away', 'should', 'tell', 'film', 'heading', 'wrong', 'direction', 'Tom', 'given', 'careful', 'instructions', 'boss', 'basically', 'up', 'everything', 'will', 'go', 'wrong', 'next', 'hour', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'growing', 'assortment', 'oddball', 'characters', 'who', 'show', 'up', 'entering', 'house', 'get', 'leave', 'Included', 'group', 'are', 'Richter', 'Lisa', 'trouble', 'brother', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'thug', 'named', 'T.J.', 'testimonial', 'have', 'far', 'career', 'gone', 'downhill', 'quot', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'quot', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'fired', 'secretary', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'away.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'interesting', 'show', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'worse', 'have', 'click', 'Simon', 'find', 'video', 'version', 'key', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'Zucker', 'made', 'convince', 'studio', 'let', 'film', 'real', 'sense', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'sort', 'redeemed', 'film', 'least', 'one', 'level', 'leaving', 'equation', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'quot', 'My', 'Boss', 'Daughter', 'quot', 'even', 'more', 'laughable', 'bad', 'way', 'person', 'who', 'most', 'wasted', 'film', 'Stamp', 'who', 'early', 'scenes', 'then', 'reduced', 'be', 'butt', 'jokes', 'end', 'sorry', 'resistance', 'down', 'such', 'quips', 'point', 'Kutcher', 'essentially', 'playing', 'straight', 'man', 'here', 'really', 'nothing', 'offensive', 'just', 'watches', 'everybody', 'else', 'try', 'tank', 'careers', 'there', 'message', 'buried', 'film', 'mean', 'importance', 'regular', 'breast', 'exams', 'check', 'lumps', 'Sure', 'love', 'kids', 'more', 'bird', 'Apparently', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'so', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'news', 'Next', 'week', 'are', 'going', 'try', 'sit', 'quot', 'Gigli.', 'quot', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'believe', 'could', 'be', 'worse', 'film']",N/A

It doesn't and is actually a funny romp filled with pranks and antics.Ashton Kutcher plays a quiet young man secretly carrying a crush on his boss's daughter, Tara Reid. The boss is a rigid, angry business man who expects perfection and no errors; he is perfectly cast and played by Terence Stamp. The story begins with Kutcher accepting a house-sitting job for Reid believing he was going to have a date instead. He is given strict rules and regulations on what not to do in the house by his boss, he is to feed and doctor a pet owl (with all sorts of neurotic behaviors), leave no damage to anything and protect the house from invaders (despite a bear trap on the lawn meant to do so). Needless to say all hell breaks loose when a cast of characters shows up filled with comedic havoc (Andy Richter, Molly Shannon, Michael Madsen, Jeffrey Tambor, Carmen Electra and Dave Foley).This film is filled with great comedy, silly antics and a constant stream of characters that will keep you laughing from beginning to end.
