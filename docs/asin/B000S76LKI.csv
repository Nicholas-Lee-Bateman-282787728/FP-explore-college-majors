1085526,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B000S76LKI,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[4, 5]","Somehow the novelty of the fact that the Cuyler family is one of the rare, endangered ""North Georgia Mountain Squid"" never ceases to be hilarious as they do stuff, usually involving lots of mayhem and insanity and drunkenness.Unknown Hinson's voice is a goldmine that makes any and all lines spoken by Early into hilarity waiting to happen, or not.  The accents, the butchered english, the jokes, the sounds, all the sort of things, all done to a poorly animated, poorly drawn visuals that nevertheless are fun to watch because of their grit and filthiness.Unfortunately for the show, it's one of those ""Adult Swim"" originals that typically will have a fanbase only as large as a hatebase.  As many people would/will hate the show as much as people would love it.Surprisingly, the creators, in one of the DVD bonus documentaries, take the show idea quite seriously, and detail stories of how hundreds of people put together crappy auditions for the roles, and how they did not want to ""mock"" Southern people or accents, but wanted genuine Southerners in the roles so as to make it sound more natural.Another feature is an introduction to the character (because he sure as hell ain't real) of Unknown Hinson, created and played by Stuart Daniel Baker, a creation of his he's played on local television in the South, and has released several albums of genuine music for.  You can find his album ""The Future is Unknown"" on Amazon, and see clips from his live performances on Youtube (including a masterfully done cover of Jimi Hendrix's ""Voodoo Child"").He's a genuine artist, musician, performer, and actor, and even though he sounds identical and seems similar to Early Cuyler, he's completely different and a delight to see in this feature on the DVD, from behaving like a diva for the show's production, berating Dana Snyder for using a ""girly"" voice when voicing Granny, and chasing people around with a gun.  It's all great.Ultimately, though, the show is about crazed dialogue, overt offensive humor, and seemingly ""random"" things (such as aliens who befriend the Cuyler, and shout ""Death to America!"" at random moments, which no one seems to notice).This is a show that is immensely quotable.  So I leave you with quotes:""Granny: When I was little, we didn't have fancy ketchup. We just had ketchup. We used to make it out in the back out of possum tails. Only we just called it blood.""""Dan Halen: And what about your work ethic?Earlie Cuyler: I don't think ethnics do no work, I mean that's they problem really. If you ain't like me go hang from a damn tree.Dan Halen: Overt racial prejudice. Impressive.""""Early Cuyler: She was my dream, my muse. A vision suitable for the wide-screen format. I can still taste her fist against my face. The sweet sugary sweat from a lifetime of diabetes. A heartbeat you could hear from six blocks away. One big pump every hour.""""Dan Halen: Good work, Denny. You've arrested a fish... and your car.Denny: Mmmhmm. Yep, I done it. Thank you.Dan Halen: Any reason?Denny: Suspicion, collusion... That that car goin' use that wide mouth bass goin' turn into a robot. Probably.Dan Halen: Denny, I highly doubt that. But, if that's how you choose to spend your weekend.Denny: I reckon I do. I'm the law. Tell 'em I done whittle this down to get that piece of corn out of my teeth that's been buggin me for two weeks.Dan Halen: Very impressive. Do you see that cloud outside?[indicating poisonous cloud killing the townspeople]Denny: Yeah-huh.Dan Halen: Direct traffic into it.""""Early Cuyler: Godalmighty, we ask you to bless this feast that lie before us, and please allow these spent lottery tickets with their silvery scratchery seasonings to nourish our bodies as they were unable to do the same to our wallets. Lord, thankya for the untimely frost you sent what claimed our pointless bananer orchards. Oh I was a fool to plan bananers on a mountain, you made sure of that.

It was about 2 in the morning, and she was laughing so hard she could barely speak. She had found an episode of the Squidbillies on television while being unable to sleep. Due to the time of night and my mother's quirky sense of humor, I accused of her of making the whole thing up! I could not believe that what she was describing, was actually being aired on adult swim. I believed even adult swim had a fine line. Apparently not! lol! A few weeks later, I discovered that my mother had been telling the truth. There was a cartoon called Squidbillies. I went onto youtube and viewed a few clips then purchased this dvd. The rest if history! If you are looking for a very unique, odd but unbelievably funny cartoon- then this is the one for you. This was right up my alley. It truly is a guilty pleasure. You just can not stop watching and the theme song is addictive. LOVE IT! My favorite character is granny.

I enjoy ROBOT CHICKEN and HARVEY BIRDMAN-ATTORNEY AT LAW but I have to say that SQUIDBILLIES gives me the biggest belly laughs from the Cartoon Channel's late night Adult Swim fare.Having grown up on the edge of Appalachia (and experiencing more than my share of rednecks and hilljacks), I also love the authentic terms and phrases that lace the Squidbilly dialogue.  A lot of my laughs can be attributed to the recognition of just that!  ""All up in my business,"" ""the TV looky-box,"" etc.But there's a sharp, satirical mind behind these shows that lampoons more than just redneck culture.
