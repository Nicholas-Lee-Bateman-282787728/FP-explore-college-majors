Forget the &#34;he's too old&#34; or the &#34;his voice doesn't hold up&#34; critics, there is plenty to enjoy throughout this video.  Is he an old man?  Most certainly.  Does his voice sound like it did when he originally wrote and sang some of these songs?  No, it does not.  But when you put everything into context, his career, his tours, the bands he as started/joined, etc., this is the most logical place for him to end up.  Perhaps Greg is a cat who has used up 6 or 7 or maybe even 8 of his lives, but what he brings to the show in this video is remarkably pure.  Fancy editing and studio overdubbing might have produced a 'better' video, but it would not be a display of Greg's talent.  What you get here is very real.This is an excellent video from start to finish.  Greg isn't the grand showman, there isn't a lot of flash or fanfare, but there is a very real, very true, very honest career on display.  To the person reading this, it is obvious that you have an interest in Greg and for that reason alone I would encourage you to 'take the plunge' and get this video.",5,Lucky Man,1368403200,"05 13, 2013",2013,1210,"['believe', 'person', 'can', 'make', 'create', 'own', 'good', 'fortune', 'will', 'then', 'measures', 'Greg', 'Lake', 'King', 'Forget', '34', 'too', 'old', '34', '34', 'voice', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', '34', 'critics', 'plenty', 'enjoy', 'video', 'old', 'man', 'Most', 'certainly', 'voice', 'sound', 'did', 'when', 'originally', 'wrote', 'sang', 'songs', 'No', 'not', 'when', 'put', 'everything', 'context', 'career', 'tours', 'bands', 'as', 'started/joined', 'etc.', 'most', 'logical', 'place', 'end', 'up', 'Perhaps', 'Greg', 'cat', 'who', 'used', 'up', '6', '7', 'maybe', 'even', '8', 'lives', 'what', 'show', 'video', 'remarkably', 'pure', 'Fancy', 'editing', 'studio', 'overdubbing', 'might', 'have', 'produced', ""'better"", 'video', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'display', 'Greg', 'talent', 'What', 'get', 'here', 'very', 'real.This', 'excellent', 'video', 'start', 'finish', 'Greg', ""n't"", 'grand', 'showman', ""n't"", 'lot', 'flash', 'fanfare', 'very', 'real', 'very', 'true', 'very', 'honest', 'career', 'display', 'person', 'reading', 'obvious', 'have', 'interest', 'Greg', 'reason', 'alone', 'would', 'encourage', ""'take"", 'plunge', 'get', 'video']",Greg Lake: Live

Bernabo,"[18, 18]","At some point when I was in high school I declared that if I could have the voice of any rock singer in the world, then I would want to sing like Greg Lake.  Now, I probably would prefer to be able to play every keyboard in the world like Keith Emerson and I might have to flip a coin if the choice was between having Greg Lake's voice or being able to sing a phrase like Frank Sinatra, but ever since the first time I heard ""Lucky Man"" I have really liked the sound of this guy's voice.  I am not alone in that regard and there are Greg Lake fans who go back to before Emerson, Lake and Palmer when he was the lead singer for King Crimson, which explains why ""In the Court of the Crimson King"" is the opening track in the concert on the first disc of ""Greg Lake: Live in Concert.""I was rather surprised that most of the songs in the concert are from the ELP days including ""From the Beginning"" (just once I would love to see Lake start that song on the guitar and launch into ""Roundabout"" instead), ""Touch and Go"" (Okay, that is an Emerson Lake and Powell song, but two out of three ain't bad), a version of ""Take a Pebble"" that takes advantage of Florian Opahle on acoustic guitar, ""I Believe in Father Christmas,"" ""Farewell to Arms,"" ""Fanfare for the Common Man,"" ""Footprints in the Snow,"" ""Lucky Man,"" ""Pictures at an Exhibition,"" and ""Karn Evil 9 (1st Impression - Part 2)"" for the encore.  I was even more surprised that ""Lucky Man"" was really the only ballad that Lake sang (he tells the story of how it became the last addition to ELP's debut album), because I was expecting to hear more songs like ""Still...You Turn Me On"" and some of the tracks from his side of ELP's ""Works: Volume 1.""  I should add that ""The Sage"" part of ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" would count as being a ballad.  But the only song from his solo career in the concert is ""Love You Too Much"" and there is a second King Crimson track with ""21st Century Schizoid Man.""  The concert is enjoyable and while Lake is losing power on his upper register there are plenty of moments in many of these songs where he does not have to go that high and I remember why his was the voice I coveted most in my youth.The second disc starts off with what would be called ""Greg Lake: Live in Rehearsal,"" which consists of a half-dozen full length tracks from the pre-tour rehearsals (all performed on disc 1 except for one of the aforementioned missing ballads) mixed with backstage footage and interviews with band members and others associated with the tour.  A short documentary on ""The Band"" has more interviews with the members, who explain how they came to be in Greg Lake's band (there is a nice bit where David Arch, who plays keyboards and is the group's musical director, explains how they did not intend to go the whole Keith Emerson route with lots of keyboards but could not avoid picking up an organ, a moog, a couple of more keyboards and eventually a second keyboard player).  The final treat is a live performance of ""I Believe in Father Christmas"" performed live at St. Bride's Church on London's Fleet Street.  Lake plays one of the two acoustic guitars accompanied by a keyboard player, the church's choir and Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson on flute.  The sound is not perfect (I have trouble understanding the minister's introduction), but fan's will still be enthralled.  Too bad they did not also do Anderson's ""Christmas Song,"" because that is my second favorite ""prog-rock"" Christmas song.  But three versions of Lake's Christmas song on two discs is a pretty sweet.deal, especially this far out from the Holiday season.",4,Greg Lake and a new band doing ELP and King Crimson songs in concert,1182470400,"06 22, 2007",2007,3602,"['point', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'declared', 'could', 'have', 'voice', 'rock', 'singer', 'world', 'then', 'would', 'want', 'sing', 'Greg', 'Lake', 'Now', 'probably', 'would', 'prefer', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'keyboard', 'world', 'Keith', 'Emerson', 'might', 'have', 'flip', 'coin', 'choice', 'was', 'having', 'Greg', 'Lake', 'voice', 'being', 'able', 'sing', 'phrase', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'ever', 'first', 'time', 'heard', 'Lucky', 'Man', 'have', 'really', 'liked', 'sound', 'guy', 'voice', 'am', 'not', 'alone', 'regard', 'are', 'Greg', 'Lake', 'fans', 'who', 'go', 'back', 'Emerson', 'Lake', 'Palmer', 'when', 'was', 'lead', 'singer', 'King', 'Crimson', 'why', 'Court', 'Crimson', 'King', 'opening', 'track', 'concert', 'first', 'disc', 'Greg', 'Lake', 'Live', 'Concert', 'was', 'rather', 'surprised', 'most', 'songs', 'concert', 'are', 'ELP', 'days', 'including', 'Beginning', 'just', 'once', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'Lake', 'start', 'song', 'guitar', 'launch', 'Roundabout', 'instead', 'Touch', 'Go', 'Okay', 'Emerson', 'Lake', 'Powell', 'song', 'two', 'three', 'ai', ""n't"", 'bad', 'version', 'Take', 'Pebble', 'advantage', 'Florian', 'Opahle', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'Believe', 'Father', 'Christmas', 'Farewell', 'Arms', 'Fanfare', 'Common', 'Man', 'Footprints', 'Snow', 'Lucky', 'Man', 'Pictures', 'Exhibition', 'Karn', 'Evil', '9', '1st', 'Impression', 'Part', '2', 'encore', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'surprised', 'Lucky', 'Man', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'ballad', 'Lake', 'sang', 'story', 'how', 'became', 'last', 'addition', 'ELP', 'debut', 'album', 'was', 'expecting', 'hear', 'more', 'songs', 'Still', 'Turn', 'tracks', 'side', 'ELP', 'Volume', '1', 'should', 'add', 'Sage', 'part', 'Pictures', 'Exhibition', 'would', 'count', 'being', 'ballad', 'only', 'song', 'solo', 'career', 'concert', 'Love', 'Too', 'Much', 'second', 'King', 'Crimson', 'track', '21st', 'Century', 'Schizoid', 'Man', 'concert', 'enjoyable', 'Lake', 'losing', 'power', 'upper', 'register', 'are', 'plenty', 'moments', 'many', 'songs', 'where', 'not', 'have', 'go', 'high', 'remember', 'why', 'was', 'voice', 'coveted', 'most', 'youth.The', 'second', 'disc', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'called', 'Greg', 'Lake', 'Live', 'Rehearsal', 'half-dozen', 'full', 'length', 'tracks', 'pre-tour', 'rehearsals', 'performed', 'disc', '1', 'one', 'aforementioned', 'missing', 'ballads', 'mixed', 'backstage', 'footage', 'interviews', 'band', 'members', 'others', 'associated', 'tour', 'short', 'documentary', 'Band', 'more', 'interviews', 'members', 'who', 'explain', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'Greg', 'Lake', 'band', 'nice', 'bit', 'where', 'David', 'Arch', 'who', 'keyboards', 'group', 'musical', 'director', 'how', 'did', 'not', 'intend', 'go', 'whole', 'Keith', 'Emerson', 'route', 'lots', 'keyboards', 'could', 'not', 'avoid', 'picking', 'up', 'organ', 'moog', 'couple', 'more', 'keyboards', 'eventually', 'second', 'keyboard', 'player', 'final', 'treat', 'live', 'performance', 'Believe', 'Father', 'Christmas', 'performed', 'live', 'St.', 'Bride', 'Church', 'London', 'Fleet', 'Street', 'Lake', 'one', 'two', 'acoustic', 'guitars', 'accompanied', 'keyboard', 'player', 'church', 'choir', 'Jethro', 'Tull', 'Ian', 'Anderson', 'flute', 'sound', 'not', 'perfect', 'have', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'minister', 'introduction', 'fan', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'enthralled', 'Too', 'bad', 'did', 'not', 'also', 'do', 'Anderson', 'Christmas', 'Song', 'second', 'favorite', 'prog-rock', 'Christmas', 'song', 'three', 'versions', 'Lake', 'Christmas', 'song', 'two', 'discs', 'pretty', 'sweet.deal', 'especially', 'far', 'Holiday', 'season']",Greg Lake: Live
1062966,A3QHIH7C3H81EH,B000O78628,"Lethe ""lor68""","[2, 3]","Well if you think of the end of a great artist, whose fame with ELP was interrupted by a dramatic accident which occurred to Keith Emerson in the period of ""In the Hot seat"" (to one of his hands as you know...), you won't believe that Greg has been able to create a new ensemble after a long tormented passage of his career, by touring all over Europe!! Of course the lead guitarist along with him is able to re- arrange ""Take a Pebble"" in a remarkable manner, even though for instance their version of ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" doesn't add anything new in comparison to the ELP version of the early nineties...but even Greg is involved into some excursions at the electric guitar and well supported by a good keyboard-player such as David Arch, so at the end- by excluding the tepid ballads like ""Farewell to Arms"" (except perhaps on the magic atmosphere of ""I Believe in Father Christmas"") or a useless blues rock entitled ""Paper Blood""- the other tracks- also in the present video concert- are quite remarkable! Greg's voice is not bad, being so mature, even though not clear at all in some circumstances, never mind cause I've appreciated the choice of ""Karn Evil 9"" and also the ever green ""21st Century Schizoid Man"" so much, after all!!So you'll forgive him as for some missing powerful ballads like ""Still you turn me on!"" or the solemn and imposing tune ""Jerusalem"", but his return on stage as a well supported ""soloist"" of the prog-related genre has been a true surprise during the year 2005, then becoming a fine ""confirmation"" in the following year, by means of the present live.Very interesting product and almost a must-have (final evaluation: almost ""4 stars"", cause the tepid ballads prevent me to give this DVD-live a major score).",3,"Very interesting DVD- almost a must-have: final score close to 4stars, as the tepid ballads prevent me to give it a major score!",1279411200,"07 18, 2010",2010,1750,"['Well', 'think', 'end', 'great', 'artist', 'fame', 'ELP', 'was', 'interrupted', 'dramatic', 'accident', 'occurred', 'Keith', 'Emerson', 'period', 'Hot', 'seat', 'one', 'hands', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Greg', 'been', 'able', 'create', 'new', 'ensemble', 'long', 'tormented', 'passage', 'career', 'touring', 'Europe', 'course', 'lead', 'guitarist', 'able', 're-', 'arrange', 'Take', 'Pebble', 'remarkable', 'manner', 'even', 'instance', 'version', 'Pictures', 'Exhibition', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'new', 'comparison', 'ELP', 'version', 'early', 'nineties', 'even', 'Greg', 'involved', 'excursions', 'electric', 'guitar', 'well', 'supported', 'good', 'keyboard-player', 'such', 'David', 'Arch', 'so', 'end-', 'excluding', 'tepid', 'ballads', 'Farewell', 'Arms', 'perhaps', 'magic', 'atmosphere', 'Believe', 'Father', 'Christmas', 'useless', 'blues', 'rock', 'entitled', 'Paper', 'Blood', 'other', 'tracks-', 'also', 'present', 'video', 'concert-', 'are', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'Greg', 'voice', 'not', 'bad', 'being', 'so', 'mature', 'even', 'not', 'clear', 'circumstances', 'never', 'mind', 'cause', ""'ve"", 'appreciated', 'choice', 'Karn', 'Evil', '9', 'also', 'ever', 'green', '21st', 'Century', 'Schizoid', 'Man', 'so', 'much', ""'ll"", 'forgive', 'missing', 'powerful', 'ballads', 'Still', 'turn', 'solemn', 'imposing', 'tune', 'Jerusalem', 'return', 'stage', 'well', 'supported', 'soloist', 'prog-related', 'genre', 'been', 'true', 'surprise', 'year', '2005', 'then', 'becoming', 'fine', 'confirmation', 'following', 'year', 'means', 'present', 'live.Very', 'interesting', 'product', 'almost', 'must-have', 'final', 'evaluation', 'almost', '4', 'stars', 'cause', 'tepid', 'ballads', 'prevent', 'give', 'DVD-live', 'major', 'score']",Greg Lake: Live

Ditto the arrangements.  I actually had the DVD on my table for over a week...from the moment I put it on, I was in rapture!  Greg indeed has not been in this fine form in years.  He sounded tired and raspy during the ELP tours of the 90's...not on this performance.  These renditions of classic ELP and King Crimson material  are stunning.  The audio is superb, as is the camerawork.  Greg's voice is better than I've heard it since the eighties.And no, I'm not just one more rabid ELP fan gazing through rose-colored glasses...I don't award a five-star rating to much of anything!  I can't wait to burn the audio of this show to a CD-R.  Greg also displays a humble outlook as he shares between songs.  Very refreshing on a concert DVD.  The arrangement of Take a Pebble includes an astonishing guitar solo from one of his band members.  If there's an ""uninteresting"" track on this disc, it would have to be Pictures at an Exhibition, simply because the arrangement is virtually identical to the studio version ELP did back in the early 90's.  It's still a strong performance, too; I had merely gotten ""spoiled"" by the fresh twists in the other classic material.Having also seen footage of Keith Emerson's band from 2006, I'd say he and Greg Lake are performing better with the ""fresh blood"" of new musicians inspiring them.
