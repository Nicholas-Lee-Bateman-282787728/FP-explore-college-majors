Sneed,"[0, 1]","Although I am a big fan of Sturges' films, both the ones he directed and the ones where he was the credited writer, I had never seen Unfaithfully Yours. I knew that it had only mixed reviews upon original release and was never considered one of his better films; at least not a successful one, which might be why I have skipped it all these years. But after seeing some of the Amazon reviews for the Criterion version, and at a discounted price, I figured it was worth a purchase.So I bought the film, and while I think the film is worth seeing (at least for the cost of Amazon Instant Video), I was only modestly impressed with this movie.Compared to Sturges' previous films and other great screwball-type comedies, the film is just mildly entertaining. As with many screwball comedies, the story starts with some small misunderstanding that snowballs into larger misunderstandings, in this case a vague report on his wife's activities in a hotel  lead  a husband to believe his wife is unfaithful. Very simple premise for the story, but with Sturges adding the clever plot device of flash-forward imagining on the husband's part( Rex Harrison imagining catching and punishing his wife for her infidelity). Plus we have the husband character being a renowned classical music conductor and Sturges use of the music to liven up the film score.Throw in Sturges' trademark quick dialogue delivered brilliantly by Harrison as the cultivated, articulate Englishman( think of Noel Coward), and some of the slapstick that Sturges usually deploys to perfection and it seems like Sturges is at the top of his game. Even a few of the feature players from his Paramount team show up and do their usual notable job with goofy character roles. And Linda Darnell as the beautiful and adoring wife plays a pretty good foil to HarrisonBut I don't think the ""flash forward"" works very well overall, as the movie slows down, and loses tempo. It is almost too clever, and the basic premise of a man erroneously assuming his wife unfaithful, becomes convoluted. Also, some of the gags seem stale to me, and the whole scene where Rex Harrison destroys his room as the thought of infidelity turns the urbane wit into an angry, blithering idiot feels like a tired, slapstick routine.It's ok as old Hollywood comedies go, but I can see why the film was not successful at the box office. One can appreciate Sturges effort to be a little innovative, and I found the film amusing, but not hilarious like the Sturges from the Paramount days.",3,Not up to Sturges' earlier comedies,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,2513,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'Sturges', 'films', 'ones', 'directed', 'ones', 'where', 'was', 'credited', 'writer', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Unfaithfully', 'Yours', 'knew', 'had', 'only', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'original', 'release', 'was', 'never', 'considered', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'least', 'not', 'successful', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'why', 'have', 'skipped', 'years', 'seeing', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'Criterion', 'version', 'discounted', 'price', 'figured', 'was', 'worth', 'purchase.So', 'bought', 'film', 'think', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'least', 'cost', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'was', 'only', 'modestly', 'impressed', 'movie.Compared', 'Sturges', 'previous', 'films', 'other', 'great', 'screwball-type', 'comedies', 'film', 'just', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'many', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'story', 'small', 'misunderstanding', 'larger', 'misunderstandings', 'case', 'vague', 'report', 'wife', 'activities', 'hotel', 'lead', 'husband', 'believe', 'wife', 'unfaithful', 'Very', 'simple', 'premise', 'story', 'Sturges', 'adding', 'clever', 'plot', 'device', 'flash-forward', 'imagining', 'husband', 'part', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'imagining', 'catching', 'punishing', 'wife', 'infidelity', 'have', 'husband', 'character', 'being', 'renowned', 'classical', 'music', 'conductor', 'Sturges', 'use', 'music', 'liven', 'up', 'film', 'score.Throw', 'Sturges', 'trademark', 'quick', 'dialogue', 'delivered', 'brilliantly', 'Harrison', 'cultivated', 'articulate', 'Englishman', 'think', 'Noel', 'Coward', 'slapstick', 'usually', 'perfection', 'Sturges', 'top', 'game', 'Even', 'few', 'feature', 'players', 'Paramount', 'team', 'show', 'up', 'do', 'usual', 'notable', 'job', 'goofy', 'character', 'roles', 'Linda', 'Darnell', 'beautiful', 'adoring', 'wife', 'pretty', 'good', 'foil', 'HarrisonBut', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'flash', 'forward', 'very', 'well', 'overall', 'movie', 'down', 'tempo', 'almost', 'too', 'clever', 'basic', 'premise', 'man', 'erroneously', 'assuming', 'wife', 'unfaithful', 'becomes', 'convoluted', 'Also', 'gags', 'seem', 'stale', 'whole', 'scene', 'where', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'room', 'thought', 'infidelity', 'urbane', 'wit', 'angry', 'blithering', 'idiot', 'feels', 'tired', 'slapstick', 'routine.It', 'ok', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'comedies', 'go', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'successful', 'box', 'office', 'One', 'can', 'appreciate', 'Sturges', 'effort', 'be', 'little', 'innovative', 'found', 'film', 'amusing', 'not', 'hilarious', 'Sturges', 'Paramount', 'days']",Unfaithfully Yours VHS

Rex Harrison is my favorite actor for playing characters who are obviously much smarter than the world in which he finds himself. Not being as rich as a brother-in-law makes a wiped out by the wealthy theme part of the plot, but he never comes across as being dumb enough to give all his money to Madoff. I liked the Italian, German, and Russian music that make great background for the fantasies that plague the orchestral performances one evening.

494127,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000006GE5,C. O. DeRiemer,"[6, 8]","Says British conductor Alfred De Carter to his younger and adoring wife, Daphne, at the close of Unfaithfully Yours, ""A thousand poets dreamed a thousand years...and you were born, my love."" Before we get there, however, we are in the midst of one of the most sophisticated comedies of style ever filmed, and we have witnessed Rex Harrison as De Carter give a titanic performance of plump ego, ridiculous self-righteousness and effortless comedy skill.De Carter is a famous, wealthy symphony conductor married to Daphne (Linda Darnell) and who employes the handsome Tony (Kurt Krueger) as his personal assistant. Through plausible misunderstandings he learns a private detective kept tabs on Daphne while he was in England. The detective's report is clear...Daphne spent some time in Tony's hotel room late one night wearing a negligee. De Carter first rejects the report, but the worm of jealousy burrows in. That night, while conducting, he imagines three immensely satisfying ways of dealing with the situation. They involve a straight razor applied vigorously to Daphne. Then the noble use of his check book...""This little head was never made to worry, or these little hands to work."" And last, a game of Russian roulette, with his preening wit and a cowering Tony. But after the symphony, when he attempts to implement his ideas...well, let's say De Carter finds himself in an extended scene with disasters of his own ego's making. Finally, with just a little humiliation, De Carter learns the truth about that nighttime visit to Tony's room. With the misunderstanding finally cleared up, De Carter embraces his wife and whispers to her those last lines.Without Preston Sturges' witty screenplay and clever direction, Unfaithfully Yours would be a slight and cold work indeed. Without Rex Harrison's skill and personality, Unfaithfully Yours would be as cynical as a broken promise and as funny as a man who slips on a banana peel, but shatters his jaw on the curb. Together, however, they have created a film of incredibly high style, smart dialogue that just keeps coming which Harrison delivers with precision and malice. Harrison gives a line like ""Put on the purple one...with the plumes at the hips,"" all the demeaning innuendo Sturges could hope for. Even Edgar Kennedy as Sweeney the private eye gets in the act. ""No one can handle Handel like you handle Handel,"" he enthusiastically tells De Carter. ""And your Delius...delirious!""Rex Harrison was not only an incredibly gifted stage and movie actor, he was just about the best there was for high comedy. It's no accident that most critics think he was the outstanding interpreter of Shaw and one of the best with Coward. I think he had the best line delivery in the business. What is surprising, because he can be so clever and amusing, is Harrison's handling of the extended deadpan slapstick toward the end of the movie. De Carter encounters chairs with wicker seats he steps through, tables that fall over holding lamps and phones he tries to catch, gloves that won't fit and high shelves he can barely reach. The classic is his attempt to set up the Simplicitas Home Recording Unit, ""So Simple It Operates Itself."" By the time De Carter finishes, the elegant drawing room is a shambles. Harrison, if he put his mind to it and on a good day, could possibly out Keaton Keaton.For fans of classical music, De Carter is conducting works by Rossini, Wagner and Tchaikowsky while he imagines the three ways of dealing with his ego-damaged situation. As Sturges has De Carter say at one point early in the movie, ""There's nothing serious about music. It should be enjoyed flat on the back with a sandwich in one hand and a bucket of beer in the other, and as many pretty girls around as possible.""The Criterion picture is in great shape. There are a number of extras, including an appreciation of Sturges by Terry Jones and a commentary track by three Sturges scholars.",5,A High Style Masterpiece From Preston Sturges and Rex Harrison,1141084800,"02 28, 2006",2006,3930,"['British', 'conductor', 'Alfred', 'De', 'Carter', 'younger', 'adoring', 'wife', 'Daphne', 'close', 'Unfaithfully', 'Yours', 'thousand', 'poets', 'dreamed', 'thousand', 'years', 'were', 'born', 'love', 'get', 'there', 'however', 'are', 'midst', 'one', 'most', 'sophisticated', 'comedies', 'style', 'ever', 'filmed', 'have', 'witnessed', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'De', 'Carter', 'give', 'titanic', 'performance', 'plump', 'ego', 'ridiculous', 'self-righteousness', 'effortless', 'comedy', 'skill.De', 'Carter', 'famous', 'wealthy', 'symphony', 'conductor', 'married', 'Daphne', 'Linda', 'Darnell', 'who', 'employes', 'handsome', 'Tony', 'Kurt', 'Krueger', 'personal', 'assistant', 'plausible', 'misunderstandings', 'private', 'detective', 'kept', 'tabs', 'Daphne', 'was', 'England', 'detective', 'report', 'clear', 'Daphne', 'spent', 'time', 'Tony', 'hotel', 'room', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'wearing', 'negligee', 'De', 'Carter', 'first', 'report', 'worm', 'jealousy', 'burrows', 'night', 'conducting', 'three', 'immensely', 'satisfying', 'ways', 'dealing', 'situation', 'involve', 'straight', 'razor', 'applied', 'vigorously', 'Daphne', 'Then', 'noble', 'use', 'check', 'book', 'little', 'head', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'worry', 'little', 'hands', 'work', 'last', 'game', 'Russian', 'roulette', 'preening', 'wit', 'cowering', 'Tony', 'symphony', 'when', 'implement', 'ideas', 'well', 'let', 'say', 'De', 'Carter', 'extended', 'scene', 'disasters', 'own', 'ego', 'making', 'Finally', 'just', 'little', 'humiliation', 'De', 'Carter', 'truth', 'nighttime', 'visit', 'Tony', 'room', 'misunderstanding', 'finally', 'cleared', 'up', 'De', 'Carter', 'wife', 'whispers', 'last', 'lines.Without', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'witty', 'screenplay', 'clever', 'direction', 'Unfaithfully', 'Yours', 'would', 'be', 'slight', 'cold', 'work', 'indeed', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'skill', 'personality', 'Unfaithfully', 'Yours', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'cynical', 'broken', 'promise', 'as', 'funny', 'man', 'who', 'banana', 'peel', 'jaw', 'curb', 'Together', 'however', 'have', 'created', 'film', 'incredibly', 'high', 'style', 'smart', 'dialogue', 'just', 'coming', 'Harrison', 'delivers', 'precision', 'malice', 'Harrison', 'line', 'Put', 'purple', 'one', 'plumes', 'hips', 'demeaning', 'innuendo', 'Sturges', 'could', 'hope', 'Even', 'Edgar', 'Kennedy', 'Sweeney', 'private', 'eye', 'act', 'one', 'can', 'handle', 'Handel', 'handle', 'Handel', 'enthusiastically', 'De', 'Carter', 'Delius', 'delirious', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'incredibly', 'gifted', 'stage', 'movie', 'actor', 'was', 'just', 'best', 'was', 'high', 'comedy', 'accident', 'most', 'critics', 'think', 'was', 'outstanding', 'interpreter', 'Shaw', 'one', 'best', 'Coward', 'think', 'had', 'best', 'line', 'delivery', 'business', 'What', 'surprising', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'clever', 'amusing', 'Harrison', 'handling', 'extended', 'deadpan', 'slapstick', 'end', 'movie', 'De', 'Carter', 'chairs', 'wicker', 'seats', 'tables', 'fall', 'holding', 'lamps', 'phones', 'catch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fit', 'high', 'shelves', 'can', 'barely', 'reach', 'classic', 'attempt', 'set', 'up', 'Simplicitas', 'Home', 'Recording', 'Unit', 'So', 'Simple', 'time', 'De', 'Carter', 'finishes', 'elegant', 'drawing', 'room', 'shambles', 'Harrison', 'put', 'mind', 'good', 'day', 'could', 'possibly', 'out', 'Keaton', 'Keaton.For', 'fans', 'classical', 'music', 'De', 'Carter', 'conducting', 'works', 'Rossini', 'Wagner', 'Tchaikowsky', 'three', 'ways', 'dealing', 'ego-damaged', 'situation', 'Sturges', 'De', 'Carter', 'say', 'one', 'point', 'early', 'movie', 'nothing', 'serious', 'music', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'flat', 'back', 'sandwich', 'one', 'hand', 'bucket', 'beer', 'other', 'many', 'pretty', 'girls', 'possible', 'Criterion', 'picture', 'great', 'shape', 'are', 'number', 'extras', 'including', 'appreciation', 'Sturges', 'Terry', 'Jones', 'commentary', 'track', 'three', 'Sturges', 'scholars']",Unfaithfully Yours VHS
494128,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,B000006GE5,Douglas M,"[0, 0]","""Unfaithfully Yours"" is a sophisticated, witty and black comedy written and directed by the great Preston Sturges. The reviews on Amazon indicate that it is not to everyone's taste. The script is brilliant satire but my reservation is with the leads. Rex Harrison was often an unsympathetic actor and while he is perfect as the egotistical maestro, he lacks the warmth which would make the maestro just a little bit likeable. It is this lack of sympathy which may have prompted the public's reaction because this film was not a box office success on its original release; not the least reason would have been that Harrison was involved in a messy scandal at the time. Linda Darnell plays his wife but the part does not lend itself to any great acting though she looks great.The real reason for buying this DVD is that it has been given the Criterion treatment. That means there are some worthwhile extras and the print is outstanding. By far the best of these is the interview with Sandy Sturges, the director's widow.  She is a charming woman and her comments are sharp. For example, in reference to Darnell's performance, she simply said she followed directions which perfectly summarises the adequacy of the performance but with no suggestion of any originality or individualism on the actress's part.The commentary is only fair. There are 3 commentators and Diane Jacobs, in particular, is shrill, and disagrees with her colleagues on a number of points which only serves to confuse the listener. It would have been better if they had worked out their differences before making the commentary. The Introduction by Terry Jones is pointless but harmless. The Theatrical Trailer is included and indicates that the film was marketed almost as a film noir, which it is not.

494129,A1QJC4OTICYGJY,B000006GE5,D. Parisi,"[4, 5]","Preston Sturges just might be the greatest writer/director ever to have worked in Hollywood. Of his great comedies, any one may be said to be his finest: the moving humor of Sullivan's Travels, the censor-defying scandal-causing hilarity of The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, the high sophistication of The Lady Eve, the sarcastic finger pointing satire of Hail the Conquering Hero, or even the beautiful trifling bauble that is Christmas in July.But my vote goes to Unfaithfully Yours, Sturges' blackest, most sinister, and most sophisticated comedy. Some might say it could never compare to his earlier Paramount comedies, but in my opinion, Sturges never displayed his great talent as a filmmaker better than in this Twentieth Century Fox classic.In his adroit combination of highly sophisticated verbal comedy, pratfalling physical gags, and audio humor, Sturges has created a comedic tale of warmth, beauty, and, at times, memorable terror.The plot concerns an orchestra conductor, who through a series of unfortunate misunderstandings, suspects his beautiful wife of carrying on an affair with his secretary.During his evening concert, the conductor imagines three different ways of dealing with this problem, all while conducting some famous pieces of classical music.First, we get Fanatasia gone terribly wrong, as the razor-yielding conductor violently slashes his wife's throat to the dazzling overture from Rossini's Semiramide. He then gives us a tale of remorse, as Tannhauser's Pilgrim's Chorus provides the backdrop for a brief moment of forgiveness. And he finally presents a disturbing game of Russian Roulette to the strains of Tchaikovsky's Francesca di Rimini Overture...But it is not until after the concert is over that the conductor must choose which of the three plans he wants to actually use on his wife. Back at his hotel apartment, Sturges' conductor tries to put into reality his plans which worked out so perfectly in his imagination---with little to no luck.No description of Unfaithfully Yours could ever come close to summarizing the genius contained within the film. Sturges has so much to say about the male ego, relationships, music, and pride that the film can be viewed as a commentary on all of these things.The cast is uniformly marvelous. Although many lament the fact that Sturges wasn't allowed to use his trustworthy cast of stock actors he had used consistently in his Paramount features, he certainly got equally good players to fill in all of his parts. Controlling the picture is Rex Harrison, who plays the conductor. His venemous line delivery and collosal temper create one of the most memorable characters in the cinematic tradition. Linda Darnell, a beauty of enormous unsung talent, displays her subtle comic technique in this film, creating four different and distinct characters: the real wife, the seductive tramp in the first hallucination, the guilty lover in the second, and the jittery nervous paramour in the third. She, under the magic hand of Sturges, displays acting of the highest form. Second leads Barbara Lawrence and Rudy Vallee give wonderful comedic performances that always hit their marks head on. And every single supporting role, from the private detective to the hotel telephone operators, are solid gold.In all, Preston Sturges' Unfaithfully Yours is a film no fan can afford to miss.

494130,A3L31489BCB1D7,B000006GE5,El Kabong,"[59, 61]","In hindsight, Paramount's decision to terminate their relationship with Preston Sturges occupies the region between 'insane', 'irresponsible' and that old standby, 'stupid'. Sturges' subsequent relocation to Fox was, of course, utterly disastrous; which makes UNFAITHFULLY YOURS as much a miracle as it is a great comedy. His stock company (save for a very funny Rudy Vallee) was now a thing of the past; although the cast he assembled here is game and lively, Edgar Kennedy foremost among them. Nevertheless, UNFAITHFULLY YOURS is Sturges' second consecutive attempt (after MAD WEDNESDAY) to move away from his trademark of the inspired dialogue-comedy and towards a more visual (or in this case, audio-visual) farce. Fortunately for us, he succeeded brilliantly (not that it cut him any ice in an increasingly desperate studio-system that not only didn't know what to do with its few geniuses but began to openly despise them). Rex Harrison plays a vain, high-strung symphony conductor who -thanks inadvertantly to his cuckold of a brother in law (Vallee, naturally)- begins to suspect his wife of having an affair. What follows is an amazingly supple and creative variation of the boudoir-farce, highlighted by the famous virtuoso segments in which Harrison daydreams of killing her to the strains of Rossini, Wagner &amp; Tchaikovsky, as well as the classic finale where cold-bloodedness and high culture both are reduced to slapstick bumbling (silent comedy, always near &amp; dear to Sturges' heart, is a definite influence here).

L'hoir,"[3, 5]","When I saw this movie as a kid, it was billed as a murder mystery, and I recall being so horrified as Rex Harrison planned and executed his fiendish and ghastly perfect crime that I wanted to leave the movie theatre; and then when the entire scenario was turned on its head as Harrison actually put what turned out to be a figment of his musical imagination into action--or made a bungling effort to do so--I was very glad I had not left. My sides ached from tear-splashed laughter then, and they still do every time I watch this gem of a film.Now that I am older, I also appreciate what a brilliantly sophisticated comedy Preston Sturges' ""Unfaithfully Yours"" is. Harrison's wit is (pardon the pun) razor sharp. Linda Darnell is stunningly beautiful both as the faithful wife of reality and the guilty wife of Harrison's imagination. The supporting cast, which includes Rudy Vallee as the pompous twit who stirs up the entire tempest in a teapot, and Barbara Lawrence as his acerbic wife, is excellent. Every character, in fact--from the handsome would-be lover down to the detectives, the tailor and the cymbal percussionist--is finely delineated.

Preston Struges' comedy Unfaithfully Yours has nothing to do with democracy, or genetics, but the actual ability of the mind to imagine.  Besides the aptitude of the mind, it can also be incapacitated by emotional reactions, which could effectively destroy any positive progress of the mind.  Nonetheless, emotions can also be an artistic source of genius, if coherently processed and displayed.  Sturges considers multiple angles of the mind in his brilliant Unfaithfully Yours, which delivers an amusing roller coaster that exploits the prowess and vulnerability of the mind to perfection.On the return to United States, the English aristocrat and world famous conductor Sir Alfred De Carter (Rex Harrison) embraces his younger wife Daphne (Linda Darnell) at the airport.  Uncaring of the audience, Sir Alfred kisses while declaring his love for Daphne in a way only a poet could in a moment of genius.  Then the Carter couple retreats to their hotel room, where they permanently live, for a quiet night in each others arms.  The following day, the bubble of love seems to blow up when his socially inept and wealthy brother-in-law August comes to inform Sir Alfred about an arrangement that has completely slipped his mind.  The arrangement was for August to ""keep an eye on his wife"" while Sir Alfred was in England.  To complicate things, August misunderstood Sir Alfred's request and hired a private detective to shadow his wife.  Sir Alfred's intention with ""keep an eye on his wife"" was for August and his wife to take out Daphne for amusement, if she was bored.The grave misunderstanding by August embarrasses Sir Alfred who intends to destroy any evidence of the hired private detective. In addition, Sir Alfred desires to know nothing about what the detectives might have discovered, as his moral judgment of the situation tells him that this is wrong in the most vile manner.  However, by accident Sir Alfred discovers that Daphne, on a late evening occasion when he was in England, left her room dressed only in a negligee.  The discovery upsets him, and when he returns home strong feelings of resentment boil up and begin to cloud his thoughts, while he must prepare for the evening concert.Rage, sadness, resentment and many other feelings storm through Sir Alfred who intends to perform despite his shaming findings.  He puts all of his emotions in a very controlled manner into his conducting, which helps deliver his finest performance ever.  The concert is divided into three different pieces, and each piece presents a different emotion and vision.  During his performance his visions are illustrated into perfection where he deals with his wife by arranging the perfect murder, sending her off, and a satire of bad luck.  In between his visions, the audience is feverishly applauding his brilliant performance.  After the performance, Sir Alfred intends to utilize one of these visions to end his marriage with Daphne, which presents a wittingly fitting slap-stick situation that will undoubtedly cause several deep laughs.Sturges delivery of this brilliant comedy makes it easy to just lean back and enjoy the intriguing plot or simply be amused by the wonderful humor.  Nonetheless, Sturges does not make films that are simple, as he dissects the metaphysics of Sir Alfred while also give a considerable impact with the cognitive science on the story.  To make the film even more appealing, he gives the story a dash of love, jealousy, and male insecurity, which is compounded into a charming mixture that will give any viewer something to enjoy or ponder for some time.",5,A Very Clever Comedy by Sturges,1122508800,"07 28, 2005",2005,3765,"['mind', 'ability', 'create', 'wondrous', 'things', 'ideas', 'history', 'full', 'inspired', 'examples', 'such', 'concept', 'democracy', 'understanding', 'genetics', 'Preston', 'Struges', 'comedy', 'Unfaithfully', 'Yours', 'nothing', 'do', 'democracy', 'genetics', 'actual', 'ability', 'mind', 'imagine', 'aptitude', 'mind', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'incapacitated', 'emotional', 'reactions', 'could', 'effectively', 'destroy', 'positive', 'progress', 'mind', 'Nonetheless', 'emotions', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'artistic', 'source', 'genius', 'coherently', 'processed', 'displayed', 'considers', 'multiple', 'angles', 'mind', 'brilliant', 'Unfaithfully', 'Yours', 'amusing', 'roller', 'coaster', 'prowess', 'vulnerability', 'mind', 'perfection.On', 'return', 'United', 'States', 'English', 'aristocrat', 'world', 'famous', 'conductor', 'Sir', 'Alfred', 'De', 'Carter', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'younger', 'wife', 'Daphne', 'Linda', 'Darnell', 'airport', 'Uncaring', 'audience', 'Sir', 'Alfred', 'declaring', 'love', 'Daphne', 'way', 'only', 'poet', 'could', 'moment', 'genius', 'Then', 'Carter', 'couple', 'retreats', 'hotel', 'room', 'where', 'permanently', 'live', 'quiet', 'night', 'others', 'arms', 'following', 'day', 'bubble', 'love', 'blow', 'up', 'when', 'socially', 'inept', 'wealthy', 'brother-in-law', 'August', 'inform', 'Sir', 'Alfred', 'arrangement', 'completely', 'slipped', 'mind', 'arrangement', 'was', 'August', 'keep', 'eye', 'wife', 'Sir', 'Alfred', 'was', 'England', 'complicate', 'things', 'August', 'misunderstood', 'Sir', 'Alfred', 'request', 'hired', 'private', 'detective', 'shadow', 'wife', 'Sir', 'Alfred', 'intention', 'keep', 'eye', 'wife', 'was', 'August', 'wife', 'take', 'out', 'Daphne', 'amusement', 'was', 'bored.The', 'grave', 'misunderstanding', 'August', 'embarrasses', 'Sir', 'Alfred', 'who', 'destroy', 'evidence', 'hired', 'private', 'detective', 'addition', 'Sir', 'Alfred', 'know', 'nothing', 'what', 'detectives', 'might', 'have', 'discovered', 'moral', 'judgment', 'situation', 'wrong', 'most', 'vile', 'manner', 'However', 'accident', 'Sir', 'Alfred', 'Daphne', 'late', 'evening', 'occasion', 'when', 'was', 'England', 'left', 'room', 'dressed', 'only', 'negligee', 'discovery', 'when', 'home', 'strong', 'feelings', 'resentment', 'boil', 'begin', 'cloud', 'thoughts', 'must', 'prepare', 'evening', 'concert.Rage', 'sadness', 'resentment', 'many', 'other', 'feelings', 'storm', 'Sir', 'Alfred', 'who', 'perform', 'shaming', 'findings', 'emotions', 'very', 'controlled', 'manner', 'conducting', 'deliver', 'finest', 'performance', 'ever', 'concert', 'divided', 'three', 'different', 'pieces', 'piece', 'different', 'emotion', 'vision', 'performance', 'visions', 'are', 'illustrated', 'perfection', 'where', 'wife', 'arranging', 'perfect', 'murder', 'sending', 'off', 'satire', 'bad', 'luck', 'visions', 'audience', 'feverishly', 'applauding', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'performance', 'Sir', 'Alfred', 'utilize', 'one', 'visions', 'end', 'marriage', 'Daphne', 'wittingly', 'fitting', 'slap-stick', 'situation', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'cause', 'several', 'deep', 'laughs.Sturges', 'delivery', 'brilliant', 'comedy', 'easy', 'just', 'lean', 'back', 'enjoy', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'simply', 'be', 'amused', 'wonderful', 'humor', 'Nonetheless', 'Sturges', 'not', 'make', 'films', 'are', 'simple', 'metaphysics', 'Sir', 'Alfred', 'also', 'give', 'considerable', 'impact', 'cognitive', 'science', 'story', 'make', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'appealing', 'story', 'dash', 'love', 'jealousy', 'male', 'insecurity', 'compounded', 'charming', 'mixture', 'will', 'give', 'viewer', 'something', 'enjoy', 'ponder', 'time']",Unfaithfully Yours VHS
494141,A3VLAZEPO9UJEA,B000006GE5,L. E. Cantrell,"[7, 9]","It is easy to understand why they changed everything but the bare premise of this movie for the 1984 remake.  After all, the 1948 original staggered beneath the weight of massive burdens.  Its star performer not only consented but actually seemed to delight in delivering precisely articulated dialogue in long blocks, one after another--and all at crackling pace, too.  Worse, Preston Sturges' clever, witty script plainly assumed that his audience possessed both general knowledge and willingness to pay attention for whole minutes at a time.  Worst, Sturges' plot satirized both movie stereotypes and audience expectations.Those 1948 audiences, for good and sufficient reasons of their own, did not turn out in droves nor did they shell out much money to see ""Unfaithfully Yours.""  The 1984 production team did their very best to avoid that dismal fate by jettisoning Sturges' near-perfect script, ruthlessly dumbing everything down and shrinking the film to fit the talents of twinkly little Dudley Moore.(Rex Harrison to Dudley Moore, what a falling off was there!)Harrison plays British conductor, Sir Alfred de Carter, whom the script clearly expects the audience to identify with the real conductor, Sir Thomas Beecham.  The initial satirical thrust at  audience expectations is that de Carter turns out to be a super-egotistical prima donna rather than the smooth, lovable and--yes!--twinkly Sir Thomas.  By a series of satisfactorily ridiculous plot developments, Sir Alfred becomes convinced that his beautiful and much younger wife is having an affair with his assistant.Sir Alfred has a high comedy encounter with a detective played by Edgar Kennedy, one of the finest second bananas in movie history.  The detective does his level best to convince the wronged husband to ignore or forgive his wife's little failings, lest he lose far more than he can ever hope to gain from shallow, trifling revenge.  In the course of the scene it becomes clear that the detective had not taken his own advice in the past and now bitterly regrets it.  This is a wonderful scene, and probably Kennedy's last hurrah on the screen, for he died shortly thereafter--a perfect mixture of hilarity and wistfulness.The egotist brushes aside the warnings of the detective and transforms himself into Othello's younger brother.  Before, he had been over-generous and almost too-eloquent for belief with his loving words; now, he sneers and derides.  If he does not quite get around to demanding that his bewildered wife hand over a handkerchief, it is only because time is short and he has a concert to conduct.The performance begins with an overture by Rossini.  The up-tempo music puts the conductor into a manic mood and his mind turns to a plot in which he murders his wife and casts damning suspicion on his rival.  The elaborate machinations of the murder scheme satirize whole flocks of creakily overblown films from ""The Bat"" to ""Philo Vance and the Kennel Murders.""  The second selection is the music of the pilgrims from Wagner's Tannhaeuser--a downer after Rossini.  The conductor's imagination shifts from murderous revenge to world-weary forgiveness as it satirizes the emetic nobility of films such as the often-remade ""Four Feathers.""  Finally, a Tschaikovsky piece  moves Sir Alfred's thoughts to grim competitiveness.  He will challenge his younger rival to a game of Russian roulette with his wife as a reluctant witness--think of about half the films made by John Barrymore or Doug Fairbanks, Jr.After the concert, the conductor rushes off to his home to prepare for his elaborate murder scheme, only to come hilariously crashing against the harsh reality of ruthlessly hostile mechanisms, cheerily incomprehensible operating instructions and painfully fragile chairs.In the end, the conductor's wife offers an explanation that allows him to dismiss all his suspicions and return to his original state of (illusionary?) wedded bliss.With brilliant performances, crackling dialogue, smart plotting and fine physical gags, ""Unfaithfully Yours"" ranks with ""The Ladykillers,"" ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" and ""Monsieur Verdoux,"" the best of black comedies.Five stars.IDLE SPECULATIONS: Good as it is--and it is very good--""Unfaithfully Yours"" might have been better still.Rex Harrison, however brilliant he may be in the dialogue scenes, is not by any stretch of the imagination a physical comedian.  Even though screen credit is given to a conducting coach, Harrison is painfully stiff as a conductor and as often as not behind the beat of the music he is supposed to be conducting.  And the physical comedy sequence is weakened by the obvious substitution of a stunt double from time to time--not to mention the obvious fact that Harrison's record player is far funnier than he is.  In 1948 there was an actor of the right age, one who who could have gotten away with the conductor's dialogue and would unquestionably have been side-splittingly funny while conducting or going two falls out of three with the demon record player--Charlie Chaplin.  Now THAT would have been something to see!Then there is the script.  The film ends on a subtly false note.  As ""Unfaithfuly Yours"" stands now, Linda Darnell's innocent wife neatly explains away every suspicion; she leaves not only her own virtue unblemished but also that of her unpleasant younger sister who throughout the film had been positioned as the eventual fall girl.  At the very end of the film, the fully reconciled conductor and wife turn away to depart for a happy evening on the town.I think that the studio or even Sturges, himself, cut a final  scene to conform to the nervous dictates of the Film Code.  I think that as the happy couple and their friends leave the hotel, they were intended to pass by Edgar Kennedy, the detective who had striven so hard to preserve the de Carter marriage.  I think that Darnell and Kennedy were intended to make eye contact in shared acknowledgment that the pack of lies they had concocted to reassure Sir Alfred had worked.  Then, at last, the conductor's straying wife would indeed have been Unfaithfully His.",5,A classic that ranks among the greatest of black comedies,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,6114,"['easy',

Not that it wasn't hysterically funny in parts - the scenes in which ""reality"" sets in on a fantastic flight of vengeful fantasy were classic - but some older films don't sit well precisely because their comedic line has been overshadowed by a bleaker modern reality. Especially disturbing was the fantasy murder by shaving razor. Mind you, there is no blood and you are assured this is a total fantasy, albeit dark and extravagantly overplayed, but it somehow doesn't come across as funny these days. Don't get me wrong. This is not a slasher film by any means. It means to be funny, but the dialogue, good as it is at times, gets lost being too cute, the orchestral sound flutters at an unacceptable level, even with remastering, and the only part worth seeing, just for sheer physical humor, is at the end, when Rex Harrison cannot (when he finds it) get a recording machine to work (shades of your first 10 computers), trips over electrical cords (what a dance!), cuts himself with the razor, spills ink all over his checkbook, and can't find bullets for his gun. Again, I find Mad Wednesday and Sullivan's Travels absolutely terrific, which is why I was expecting more from this film. Maybe I wasn't in the mood. There are excellent comedic moments, and I love the classical pieces being played (despite the crummy sound quality), but somehow the ""parts"" didn't quite make a whole.

His rage manifests itself in a series of fantasy responses, that in reality he is far too incompetent to put into practice.  His jealousy, it seems, is not merely a matter of doubting his wife's fidelity, but manifests the tension between his mastery in front of the stage, and his incompetence to carry out his plans and to manage things by himself and without help from his wife and his assistant.  A rich and dark fantasy exploration of the contrast between art and life, between the kind of trust that is necessary to sustain a marriage and the natural doubt that arises, it's a delightful film that shows Sturges to be a master of his craft.  The dialogue is sharp, the acting perfect, and nearly everything said works on multiple levels.  It's very funny, but poignant too, and the Criterion set is put together quite nicely.  Includes audio commentary by Sturges scholars James Harvey, Diane Jacobs, and Brian Henderson, a video introduction by writer-director Terry Jones, an interview with Sturges's widow Sandy Sturges, and a nice essay by Jonathan Lethem.",5,Delightfully sophisticated and dark comedy of suspicion,1307750400,"06 11, 2011",2011,1185,"['talented', 'composer', 'height', 'powers', 'suspect', 'beautiful', 'young', 'wife', 'having', 'affair', 'rage', 'series', 'fantasy', 'responses', 'reality', 'far', 'too', 'incompetent', 'put', 'practice', 'jealousy', 'not', 'merely', 'matter', 'doubting', 'wife', 'fidelity', 'tension', 'mastery', 'front', 'stage', 'incompetence', 'carry', 'out', 'plans', 'manage', 'things', 'help', 'wife', 'assistant', 'rich', 'dark', 'fantasy', 'exploration', 'contrast', 'art', 'life', 'kind', 'trust', 'necessary', 'sustain', 'marriage', 'natural', 'doubt', 'delightful', 'film', 'Sturges', 'be', 'master', 'craft', 'dialogue', 'sharp', 'acting', 'perfect', 'nearly', 'everything', 'said', 'works', 'multiple', 'levels', 'very', 'funny', 'poignant', 'too', 'Criterion', 'set', 'put', 'together', 'quite', 'nicely', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Sturges', 'scholars', 'James', 'Harvey', 'Diane', 'Jacobs', 'Brian', 'Henderson', 'video', 'introduction', 'writer-director', 'Terry', 'Jones', 'interview', 'Sturges', 'widow', 'Sandy', 'Sturges', 'nice', 'essay', 'Jonathan', 'Lethem']",Unfaithfully Yours VHS
494144,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000006GE5,Robert Moore,"[6, 8]","In the history of Hollywood there are few greater mysteries than: what happened to Preston Sturges's talent.  From the 1930s, when he emerged as one of the sharpest screenwriters at Paramount to his short but brilliant career as a director, Sturges could do almost no wrong.  After crafting such outstanding scripts for films like EASY LIVING and REMEMBER THE NIGHT, Sturges was allowed to direct his own scripts, and the result was a string of brilliant comedies that were noted for their frenetic pace, frantic multi-layered dialogue, and brilliant slapstick.  Between 1940 and 1944 he managed to turn out THE GREAT MCGINTY, CHRISTMAS IN JULY, THE LADY EVE, SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS, THE PALM BEACH STORY, THE MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK, and HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO.  No other director in history ever enjoyed a finer five years directing comedy than that.  Then, suddenly, his gifts were gone, never to be fully regained.  What is astonishing is how completely his gifts deserted him.Sturges did, however, manage to regain form to turn out one final good comedy.  UNFAITHFULLY YOURS is not among his finest films, but in the post-1944 period, it is clearly his last good one.  If one turns from THE PALM BEACH STORY to UNFAITHFULLY YOURS, one notices how much has been lost.  In the latter there is no rapid-fire dialogue, no brilliant witticisms, few touches of inspired anarchy.  There is in the final part of the film some wonderfully slapstick, but by the standards that Sturges had set for himself, it has to stand as something of a disappointment.Still, if one can put THE LADY EVE and SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS out of mind for a bit, and view UNFAITHFULLY YOURS strictly on its own merits, it is a highly entertaining film graced by a splendid star performance by the always fascinating Rex Harrison.  It is also made with enormous competence and style.  Just watch the way the camera gradually flows from behind the orchestra all the way to an extreme close up on Sir Alfred's eye.For the most part, this is not a funny film nor is it meant to be.  The first two thirds of the film are, in fact, barely humorous at all.  It is all set up for the hilarity at the end.  Sir Alfred has learned that detectives have reason to suspect that his wife might be unfaith to him with his personal secretary.  The chief detective is played by Edgar Kennedy, who is famous for his slow burns in a host of films from the silent era through the advent of sound, perhaps most famously as the lemonade vendor in DUCK SOUP.  He died shortly after appearing in this film.  At first Sir Alfred refuses to believe the rumors, but by the time the concert begins he is convinced of her duplicity, and during the concert he allows the music to seduce him into fantasies of revenge and murder and suicide.  The humor comes only at the end when he sneaks off to put his fantasies into action.  But instead of the suave, competent murder of his imagination, he becomes an oafish, bungling fool, almost demolishing his apartment searching for all the items he needs to implement his plans.  It is a brilliant sequence, and while it doesn't cause a Sturges fan from lamenting the loss of verbal brilliance found in the earlier films, it is nonetheless a delightful sequence.  The ending is a bit abrupt and a tad too pat, but all in all it is a highly entertaining film.  Rex Harrison has been better in film, but only rarely.Sir Alfred de Carter is, by the way, a subtle parody of the brilliant English conductor Sir Thomas Beecham, one of my favorite conductors (I have around ten CDs featuring him as conductor).  The resemblance is referential rather than visual, since Harrison bears little resemblance to Sir Thomas.  One reference to Beecham stems from Edgar Kennedy's mention of Sir Alfred's mastery of Delius.  The one conductor who is inevitably associated with Delius is Sir Thomas Beecham, who is the definitive interpreter of his work.  The Delius reference alone would be sufficient to reference Beecham, but the names are also a giveaway.  Harrison's Carter alludes indirectly to the Carter Liver Pills and their role in keeping ""England regular.""  Sir Thomas Beecham's family owned the Beecham's Liver Pills and hopefully also did their share in keep England regular.  Anyone wanting to explore Beecham's work should look either at his recordings of Delius, his marvelous recording of LA BOHEME (with the brilliant Jussi Bjoerling), or the disc that collects his recordings of Sibelius's 4th and 6th Symphonies.After UNFAITHFULLY YOURS, the quality of Sturges's work plummeted.  Although he is widely regarded as one of the great comic directors in film history, he actually made an astonishingly small number of films.  His reputation rests on the brilliance of those films of 1940-1944, though this one certainly very nearly stands comparison with those.",4,Preston Sturges's Last Hurrah,1124496000,"08 20,

Unfaithfully yours "" is a black humour farce ( and also Sturges' revenge to high comedy ) with a comedy timing that never falls down where Sturges combines masterfully biting dialogues with hilarious sight gags.

Niduaza ""menace!""","[4, 4]","Although it is unfortunate that this film was not successful when it was released (partially due to the Rex Harrison/Carole Landis scandal and also to the dark tones of the film), it is arguably one of the three greatest Sturges films (along with Sullivan's Travels and Hail the Conquering Hero).If there is one film that showcases Sturges' talent as a screenwriter, this one is it. The dialogue is consistently hysterical, from the opening salvo between Sir Alfred and his brother-in-law to the 'Russian Roulette' speech. If there is one thing Sturges got right with this film, it's the dialogue - it's cuttingly funny and delivered with perfect timing.This brings me to Rex Harrison, who gives one of the funniest performances in cinema history. He is perfect, and perfectly neurotic, as Sir Alfred, a jealous symphony conductor obsessed with the idea that his wife and confidant are having an ongoing affair. His wife, played by Linda Darnell, isn't necessarily the strong female typical of Sturges' earlier work but her leisurely composition and smooth voice give a stark contrast to Harrison's loud, uptight Alfed. And I think the dynamic really shines when Alfred is at odds with Daphne(the Darnell character).For what is generally known for being a straight comedy, the structure of Unfaithfully Yours is really unique. The second act of the film is comprised of a series of fantasies, all of which take place in Sir Alfred's mind (while he's conducting a concert, no less). More interesting still, one of the lengthier episodes is a full-on shocker, a film noir with darkly comic undertones. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the section would work as a short film on it's own. There are also a couple of scenes that turn full-on slapstick and (again) contrast sharply with other sections of the film.While I do feel the slapstick scenes run too long and feel a bit unnecessary, I find the contrast in styles interesting. The film is an amalgam of dialogue-driven comedy, slapstick, noir and romance. It doesn't always pay off but it's fun to watch and keeps the viewer on his/her toes. In this respect, you can see the influence Sturges had on modern film makers like Quentin Tarantino (whose also known for contrasting styles and moods).I docked one star off of the score only because I thought the two slapstick scenes (the fire-hose scene and when Alfred frantically searches for his recorder) ran too long and weren't nearly as funny as the dialogue scenes. But don't get me wrong, this movie is terrific and the two slapstick scenes aren't enough to ruin an otherwise fantastic comedy.",4,"""Have you ever heard of Russian Roulette?""",1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,2603,"['unfortunate', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'successful', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'partially', 'due', 'Rex', 'Harrison/Carole', 'Landis', 'scandal', 'also', 'dark', 'tones', 'film', 'arguably', 'one', 'three', 'greatest', 'Sturges', 'films', 'Sullivan', 'Travels', 'Hail', 'Conquering', 'Hero', '.If', 'one', 'film', 'Sturges', 'talent', 'screenwriter', 'one', 'dialogue', 'consistently', 'hysterical', 'opening', 'salvo', 'Sir', 'Alfred', 'brother-in-law', ""'Russian"", 'Roulette', 'speech', 'one', 'thing', 'Sturges', 'got', 'right', 'film', 'dialogue', 'cuttingly', 'funny', 'delivered', 'perfect', 'timing.This', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'who', 'one', 'funniest', 'performances', 'cinema', 'history', 'perfect', 'perfectly', 'neurotic', 'Sir', 'Alfred', 'jealous', 'symphony', 'conductor', 'obsessed', 'idea', 'wife', 'confidant', 'are', 'having', 'ongoing', 'affair', 'wife', 'played', 'Linda', 'Darnell', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'strong', 'female', 'typical', 'Sturges', 'earlier', 'work', 'leisurely', 'composition', 'smooth', 'voice', 'give', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Harrison', 'loud', 'uptight', 'Alfed', 'think', 'dynamic', 'really', 'shines', 'when', 'Alfred', 'odds', 'Daphne', 'Darnell', 'character', '.For', 'what', 'generally', 'known', 'being', 'straight', 'comedy', 'structure', 'Unfaithfully', 'Yours', 'really', 'unique', 'second', 'act', 'film', 'comprised', 'series', 'fantasies', 'take', 'place', 'Sir', 'Alfred', 'mind', 'conducting', 'concert', 'less', 'More', 'interesting', 'still', 'one', 'lengthier', 'episodes', 'full-on', 'shocker', 'film', 'noir', 'darkly', 'comic', 'undertones', 'fact', ""'d"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'section', 'would', 'work', 'short', 'film', 'own', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'scenes', 'turn', 'full-on', 'slapstick', 'again', 'contrast', 'sharply', 'other', 'sections', 'film.While', 'do', 'feel', 'slapstick', 'scenes', 'run', 'too', 'long', 'feel', 'bit', 'unnecessary', 'find', 'contrast', 'styles', 'interesting', 'film', 'amalgam', 'dialogue-driven', 'comedy', 'slapstick', 'noir', 'romance', ""n't"", 'always', 'pay', 'off', 'fun', 'watch', 'keeps', 'viewer', 'his/her', 'toes', 'respect', 'can', 'see', 'influence', 'Sturges', 'had', 'modern', 'film', 'makers', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'also', 'known', 'contrasting', 'styles', 'moods', '.I', 'docked', 'one', 'star', 'score', 'only', 'thought', 'two', 'slapstick', 'scenes', 'fire-hose', 'scene', 'when', 'Alfred', 'frantically', 'recorder', 'ran', 'too', 'long', 'were', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'movie', 'terrific', 'two', 'slapstick', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'ruin', 'otherwise', 'fantastic', 'comedy']",Unfaithfully Yours VHS

494151,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000006GE5,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 2]","With rare exceptions like Frasier or Comme une Image, most supposedly `sophisticated' comedies are usually either too clever by half or not half as clever as they think they are: this definitely falls into the latter category. It may be slightly more articulate, but it still comes down to pratfalls and clich&eacute;s clumsily dispensed (not to mention an incredibly one-dimensional role for Linda Darnell as the wife whose sole reason for existence seems to be to worship her husband). Unfortunately it soon becomes apparent that despite his confidence in the early part of the film, Rex Harrison is entirely wrong for the part: aside from being so incredibly unsympathetic that he simply alienates you for most of the film, he has absolutely no facility for physical comedy, which renders what could and should have been a great comic setpiece where he accidentally trashes his hotel room far more thoroughly than any rock star ever could even dream of rather tedious and protracted. (Alfred Newman's surprisingly crudely over the top slide-whistle and horn 'comic' underscoring all but stones the scene to death, a surprising lapse of judgment from a great composer in a film revolving around classical music.) In the hands of an actor with a modicum of physical comedy timing it could have been gold, but instead it's almost reduced to a technical exercise.But the same could be said for much of the film. The idea of having the execution and resolution of Harrison's fantasies dictated by the pace of the music he conducts (Rossini for murder, Wagner for mournful forgiveness, Tchaikovsky for suicide) is inspired, but it results in scenes that feel forced, as if at the mercy of a galley slave master's drumbeat. That the scenes themselves are so predictable doesn't help, as goodwill and admiration gradually gives way to boredom in the second half.There are, however, two saving graces. One is the scene in private detective Edgar Kennedy's office, where Harrison is furious to discover that the man he has come to castigate is a knowledgeable fan with his own tale of loss. The scene is crudely performed and reads better than it plays, but there's heart and humanity there that's lacking in too much of the rest of the film. But the film's genuine standout moment is the orchestra rehearsal, one of the best pieces of filmed musical performance in the movies, not only showing how the music is constructed but showing the life, character and human soul behind it. The loss of those qualities in the rest of the movie is all the more keenly felt in an increasingly arid and overplayed technical exercise.",2,Too often an arid technical exercise and not nearly as funny as it thinks it is,1156982400,"08 31, 2006",2006,2614,"['rare', 'exceptions', 'Frasier', 'Comme', 'une', 'Image', 'most', 'supposedly', 'sophisticated', 'comedies', 'are', 'usually', 'either', 'too', 'clever', 'half', 'not', 'half', 'as', 'clever', 'think', 'are', 'definitely', 'latter', 'category', 'may', 'be', 'slightly', 'more', 'articulate', 'still', 'down', 'pratfalls', 'clich', 'eacute', 'clumsily', 'dispensed', 'not', 'mention', 'incredibly', 'one-dimensional', 'role', 'Linda', 'Darnell', 'wife', 'sole', 'reason', 'existence', 'be', 'worship', 'husband', 'soon', 'apparent', 'confidence', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'entirely', 'wrong', 'part', 'aside', 'being', 'so', 'incredibly', 'unsympathetic', 'simply', 'most', 'film', 'absolutely', 'facility', 'physical', 'comedy', 'what', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'comic', 'setpiece', 'where', 'accidentally', 'hotel', 'room', 'far', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'rock', 'star', 'ever', 'could', 'even', 'dream', 'rather', 'tedious', 'protracted', 'Alfred', 'Newman', 'surprisingly', 'crudely', 'top', 'slide-whistle', 'horn', ""'comic"", 'underscoring', 'scene', 'death', 'surprising', 'lapse', 'judgment', 'great', 'composer', 'film', 'revolving', 'around', 'classical', 'music', 'hands', 'actor', 'modicum', 'physical', 'comedy', 'timing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'gold', 'instead', 'almost', 'reduced', 'technical', 'exercise.But', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'much', 'film', 'idea', 'having', 'execution', 'resolution', 'Harrison', 'fantasies', 'dictated', 'pace', 'music', 'Rossini', 'murder', 'Wagner', 'mournful', 'forgiveness', 'Tchaikovsky', 'suicide', 'inspired', 'results', 'scenes', 'feel', 'forced', 'mercy', 'galley', 'slave', 'master', 'drumbeat', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'predictable', ""n't"", 'help', 'goodwill', 'admiration', 'gradually', 'way', 'boredom', 'second', 'half.There', 'are', 'however', 'two', 'saving', 'graces', 'One', 'scene', 'private', 'detective', 'Edgar', 'Kennedy', 'office', 'where', 'Harrison', 'furious', 'discover', 'man', 'come', 'castigate', 'knowledgeable', 'fan', 'own', 'tale', 'loss', 'scene', 'crudely', 'performed', 'better', 'heart', 'humanity', 'there', 'lacking', 'too', 'much', 'rest', 'film', 'film', 'genuine', 'standout', 'moment', 'orchestra', 'rehearsal', 'one', 'best', 'pieces', 'filmed', 'musical', 'performance', 'movies', 'not', 'only', 'showing', 'how', 'music', 'constructed', 'showing', 'life', 'character', 'human', 'soul', 'loss', 'qualities', 'rest', 'movie', 'more', 'keenly', 'felt', 'increasingly', 'arid', 'overplayed', 'technical', 'exercise']",Unfaithfully Yours VHS

Although there was an anemic remake with Dudley Moore in 1984 (with a screenplay co-written by Valerie Curtain the cousin of Jane Curtain of ""Saturday Night Live"" fame and one of the original cast members of ""Three's Company""), all it does is prove not to mess with a classic film.This new Criterion edition has some really cool extras and the image quality is very, very good.
