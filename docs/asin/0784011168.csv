Suffice it to say, this is neither a popcorn horror flick nor a heartwarming drama.  Set in 1970s New York, Jacob's Ladder deals with the aftermath of one man's experiences in Vietnam.  It's a cerebral ""mess with your head"" kind of film that will likely scare and disturb you.  As in the more recent ""Memento"", plot twists invite continual re-evaluation of what has gone before.  What really happened to Jake and his buddies on that fateful day in Vietnam?  Has he left his wife for Jez (Elizabeth Pena) or hasn't he?  Where is his son Gabe?  Are his waking supernatural visions drug-induced hallucinations, PTSD, or something else?  The best way to answer these questions is to stop reading (now!) and watch it for yourself a few times.

I came into the movie not expecting much, and left the movie with my mind buzzing with possibilities.Jacob's ladder is a movie that deals with realities, demons, ghost's, hallucinations, and monsters. There are uses of these demon's that took me by surprise, because as apposed to normal shock-like scares this is more dream-like. When a movie begins dealing with the imagination, it can do whatever it wants, but good for us the director stayed grounded and kept everything possible.It could all be interpreted in one way or another. It is presented in a jumble of idea's of what could be this character's reality, then doubles back and it's not real at all. The ending took me by surprise, as I knew it was going to be a shocker because the movie was leading to one. I couldn't guess the ending, though it was staring me in the face the entire time.When your through, you may have a new appreciation of veterans. You may feel a loss for explanation. If your not the figure-it-out or think-about-it-later type, you may hate it. Not this reviewer, because a day later I am still digging around through the story and piecing it back together. Even a bare bones horror fan should like Jacobs Ladder.It deals with the mind, and it deals with a heaven and hell that could be experienceed. It's about finding peace and resolution with our own personal guilts. And finally, its a movie in search of an audience.

74545,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0784011168,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 4]","In parts, `Jacob's Ladder' works.  In other parts it doesn't.  The initial concept behind `Jacob's Ladder' is intriguing, but the way director Adrian Lyne constructs the film takes away from the overall satisfaction I would have liked to have received from the film.  I actually found myself bored in areas where captivating my interest should have been the films only concern.  Bruce Joel Rubin's screenplay is a little rough.  It tries hard to flesh out the issues at stake, but the muddled dialog and the confusing patchwork ultimately restrict the film from ever truly reaching its potential.Now it's obvious that `Jacob's Ladder' has a lot of supporters, and I can understand why.  The visual candor of the film is alarming and shocking and consuming in sections (the dance sequence is particularly startling).  A film this brash is bound to gather cult status among moviegoers, and I can't say that I disagree with the reasoning behind its support.  I personally can't find a reason to support it myself, but that doesn't mean this film doesn't mean something to someone else.Jacob Singer is a Vietnam veteran who is dealing with some very abnormal visions and nightmares.  These nightmares don't seem to want to remain in his head and they start manifesting themselves into the waking hours of his life.  When this happens Jacob begins to struggle with cause of it all.Is he going insane?Is he overly stressed?Could it be that he is experiencing the aftereffects of drug testing he underwent while in Vietnam?The end result is a little less satisfying than it could have been, and I find that the `surprise' at the end of the tunnel is not quite as `surprising' as one is led to believe.  Sadly, the construction of the film is not its only vice.  Personally I never really got behind the acting either; especially that of Tim Robbins.  I will admit to being a big fan of his.  I think that his work on films like `The Player' and `The Shawshank Redemption' and `Mystic River' (for which he won an Oscar) is phenomenal to say the least.  Here Robbins is lackluster, never really becoming inspired by his character.  He just appears in the scenes, but never truly breathes any life into them.  Honestly, the best thing about this film is Elizabeth Pena, who plays Robbins girlfriend Jezebel.  Her spirited portrayal of a concerned and conflicted party to Singer's disaster is touching and engrossing.  If not for her I quite possibly could have slept through the entire film.I know that plenty of people applaud this film; fervently at that.  I don't.  Pena was phenomenal and saved this movie.  The film does have some going for it, and like I mentioned, it works in parts, but as a whole it just doesn't fit.  It's not cohesive enough or tight enough for it to make a lasting impact.  I'll give it a C.  It's serviceable; let me put it like that.  It just needed a little more work.  The visuals are stunning and the initial concept is commendable, but the overall delivery leaves much to be desired.",3,This ladder isn't sturdy enough to carry all that weight...,1218672000,"08 14, 2008",2008,3008,"['parts', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'works', 'other', 'parts', ""n't"", 'initial', 'concept', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'intriguing', 'way', 'director', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'film', 'away', 'overall', 'satisfaction', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'received', 'film', 'actually', 'found', 'bored', 'areas', 'where', 'captivating', 'interest', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'films', 'only', 'concern', 'Bruce', 'Joel', 'Rubin', 'screenplay', 'little', 'rough', 'hard', 'flesh', 'out', 'issues', 'stake', 'muddled', 'dialog', 'confusing', 'patchwork', 'ultimately', 'restrict', 'film', 'ever', 'truly', 'reaching', 'potential.Now', 'obvious', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'lot', 'supporters', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'visual', 'candor', 'film', 'alarming', 'shocking', 'consuming', 'sections', 'dance', 'sequence', 'particularly', 'startling', 'film', 'brash', 'bound', 'gather', 'cult', 'status', 'moviegoers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'disagree', 'reasoning', 'support', 'personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'reason', 'support', ""n't"", 'mean', 'film', ""n't"", 'mean', 'something', 'someone', 'else.Jacob', 'Singer', 'Vietnam', 'veteran', 'who', 'dealing', 'very', 'abnormal', 'visions', 'nightmares', 'nightmares', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'want', 'remain', 'head', 'start', 'manifesting', 'waking', 'hours', 'life', 'When', 'Jacob', 'struggle', 'cause', 'going', 'insane', 'overly', 'stressed', 'Could', 'be', 'experiencing', 'aftereffects', 'drug', 'testing', 'underwent', 'Vietnam', 'end', 'result', 'little', 'less', 'satisfying', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'find', 'surprise', 'end', 'tunnel', 'not', 'quite', 'surprising', 'one', 'led', 'believe', 'Sadly', 'construction', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'vice', 'Personally', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'acting', 'especially', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'will', 'admit', 'being', 'big', 'fan', 'think', 'work', 'films', 'Player', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Mystic', 'River', 'won', 'Oscar', 'phenomenal', 'say', 'least', 'Here', 'Robbins', 'lackluster', 'never', 'really', 'becoming', 'inspired', 'character', 'just', 'scenes', 'never', 'truly', 'life', 'Honestly', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'Elizabeth', 'Pena', 'who', 'Robbins', 'girlfriend', 'Jezebel', 'spirited', 'portrayal', 'concerned', 'conflicted', 'party', 'Singer', 'disaster', 'touching', 'engrossing', 'not', 'quite', 'possibly', 'could', 'have', 'slept', 'entire', 'film.I', 'know', 'plenty', 'people', 'applaud', 'film', 'fervently', 'do', ""n't"", 'Pena', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'saved', 'movie', 'film', 'have', 'going', 'mentioned', 'parts', 'whole', 'just', ""n't"", 'fit', 'not', 'cohesive', 'enough', 'tight', 'enough', 'make', 'lasting', 'impact', ""'ll"", 'give', 'C.', 'serviceable', 'let', 'put', 'just', 'needed', 'little', 'more', 'work', 'visuals', 'are', 'stunning', 'initial', 'concept', 'commendable', 'overall', 'delivery', 'much', 'be', 'desired']",N/A

The story has many twists and turns, you struggle to understand what is going on.  By the end of the movie you realize what all the plot twists really meant.

Even so, the final product addresses the basic questions that people have:1-could I have been something else, something more if I had made different choices in life?2-is life just a series of random events or are we already pre-determined for a certain fate?3-of the two roads, to success or mediocrity, which is the 'better' one?In the movie, a man continually jumps in and out of two lives in parallel: in one he was a mediocrity, a Vietnam vet and postal employee.

In the other life, he had a tony Manhattan apartment as a successful New York city professional, with everything from a beautiful wife to a wonderful child.

Well, that adjective surely fits this unusual movie, one I've only viewed once but plan on seeing again sometime this year.It's a strange film and could be taken a number of ways. For instance, it has some twisted theology but yet could also be used as a tool for evangelism. It's a difficult movie to interpret but a commentary/interview extra on DVD does explain some questions one would have after watching this because a lot of people apparently misinterpret this film.It's not family fare, I'll tell you that. The language is brutal and there are some scenes in here that are not for the feint at heart. The lead character, played by Tim Robbins, is a tortured soul and plays that role well. Most of the story is told in flashbacks as a man is dying and is going through the final stages of death, recalling some key moments in his life. Those moments are magnified: the bad being shown worse than what it was and vice/versa. The main message here is ""As long as you are afraid of death, the evil demons will torment you, but when you let go and aren't afraid anymore, you'll find those demons to be angels.""This is the kind of film you could probably write long, long essays on.

I would like to direct the reader to the Metacritic page to see how some critics labeled this as some sort of atrocity. I must say these people are absolutely full of ****. I have watched over a thousand films and this is in the top 100. I adore the acting, the direction, set design, and most of all the wonderful script.For now I won't go over much, but people need to know that loving care was given to this film by Adrian Lyne and written by Bruce Joel Rubin; you can see this love in the beautiful opening shots of vietnam to the interiors and the loving way each actor exists in the movie, they all need each other, and the direction for each involving scene is quite immersive and satisfying. The soundtrack is very pretty but sombre and sad at times. Nothing ever shows a hint of any weakness.The TIME article is so far up its own *** that I am angry at the fact this film is so mistreated by these 'professionals'. As if it is more cliche than something like Saving Private Ryan, for all its astounding splendor, the actual movie wasn't even that well tied together. This movie is tied very tight with resounding themes about dream, angels, demons, and what war means for the living and the dead. You will find that for every weakness you look for in this movie, a strength outshines it by tenfold. I cannot say enough about the acting, FROM EVERYBODY, and how this 1990 movie just doesn't feel dated, at all, and you would almost expect that from a supernatural thriller of this type. It just proves that 'they' are not making movies like this anymore in Hollywood's non Indie scene.Anyway, despite my overwhelming hatred for petty and contrived reviewers, don't listen to the bad ones, they mean nothing. The NY Times and Roger Ebert have fair and balanced reviews of this film, scoring around 90 on the Metacritic. Read them, but watch the movie first.

He knows I'm a Silent Hill fanatic and told me that this movie was the inspiration for the game. Intrigued I naturally went on a mad hunt for this very hard to find DVD. Eventually I found a copy and bought it without thinking twice.I was very eager to see this movie, and as it started up I sat at the edge of my seat waiting for signs of the inspiration that would later end up in Silent Hill. I saw some minor things at first, but soon found myself interested in this movie for another reason, to be honest the only reason you need to watch this movie, its plot.Everything in this movie makes sense from an artistic standpoint, everything in this film means something, everything has a rhym and reason, which these days is rare, especially for this kind of movie. Twist ending aside I firmly believe that this is the movie the Cell should have been. Granted this movie is the exploration of (spoiler alert) the mind of a man who is dying, where as the Cell is the exploration of the mind of a cerel killer, but this movie had meaning, where as the cell was a jumbled mess of expensive imagry.It's rare to find a psychological thriller this deep, and this powerful. While the film isn't scary some scenes stay with you whith you for a while. The thoughts expressed about the difference between demons and angels, and what they represent are simple, yet brilliant.As the film progresses the visuals do become more and more like Silent Hill (particularly the 3rd installment's creature featureViatel whose head moves in very much the same way that the demons do in this film.) There were moments that were scary, but overall this film is less about scares, and more about the state of the human mind during death, and coping with dying. In that regard this movie handles the subject of dying better than the vast majority of psychological thrillers. Its beautifully written, and masterfully executed, and yes, for Silent Hill fans there are monsters and scense in here that seem to have had a direct influence over the game series, (although Silent Hill is tremendously more greusome) particularly the scene in the assylum.Although the video transfer is relatively poor (watching on a widescreen HDTV), and the sound is not as good as other, higher end DVDs this film is a must have for horror, suspense, or even drama fans. This film is so well done it can easily fit into any of the aforementioned categories.

Safe is important just now, because it's New York in 1974. You know, back in the good ol' days of double digit inflation, urban violence; the time the City was feeling the Heat, the air stank and reeked of sweat and death and misery. A few years after Kitty Genovese was slaughtered in the court of her tenement, and fifty people looked on and did nothing.That New York. A Society cresting the wave of urban ruin, teetering over the Abyss.So yeah, in this case, safe is good. Stable is good. Paid twice a month with benefits is good. If only it weren't for the things Singer has started to see in his seedy, decrepit New York borough. Things that lurk in dark alleyways, things that gibber from crowded stalls littered in cramped and filthy transit stations.That, for sure, is Bad.H.P. Lovecraft observed that ""of Man's fears, the greatest is the fear of the Unknown."" Adrian Lyne, hot from his successes as a chronicler of the sanguine effects of dangerous indiscretions (9 & 1/2 Weeks) and marital infidelity (Fatal Attraction), could have done anything with his newfound fame and power---and moved boldly and effectively into Lovecraft territory with this nasty mix of pure grue and sheer terror.""Jacob's Ladder"" is one of the creepiest films ever made, a film so gut-twistingly nasty that it can reduce the most steely-eyed, jaded horror vet to tears and cow-eyed panic.Tim Robbins is Jacob Singer, a Vietnam veteran now returned home from the war and working as a postal worker---and seeing strange, nightmarish things. A homeless man in the subway has a tentacle for a hand, which withdraws, wormlike, into his tattered sleeve; a car tries to run Singer down on a lonely bridge, a featureless, quivering face pressed up against the dirty glass; a dance party turns into a shadow-haunted, blood-drenched abbatoir with a tentacled horror.Even that wouldn't be that bad if it weren't for Singer's `other life' making housecalls: Singer keeps ""waking up"" into another life---one with a secure career, a house, a family, and adorable little Macaulay Culkin as his son. Another life removed miles and years from his dingy, increasingly insane postal clerk life.Lyne keeps up the pace, as Singer tries to make sense of his descent into nightmare. Is he slipping into madness? Is this the result of being doused with a nerve agent in Vietnam, code-named ""Jacob's Ladder"", tested on GIs with the intent to make them killing machines---and succeeding wildly, with the slight side-effect of turning their blood frenzy on each other? Is there a government conspiracy to silence him? And which of the two lives is 'real'? Will the real Jacob Singer please stand up?True horror films capture that sense of active but unseen malice, and build on a palpable atmosphere that is brooding, destructive, and malignant---and that is why there are so few of them. Jacob's Ladder is that rarest of film, a visual descent into a nightmare in which the horror boils directly out of the atmosphere, and is even more effective and masterful in that there is---at least, not initially---an identifiable villain or source of evil.Robbins is well cast as a disintegrating man, nonetheless staving off the increasingly aggressive horrors while trying to make sense of them: he is perfect for the role, his doughy white face with its slab of pasty hair saying everything and nothing. Elizabeth Pena is also excellent as the postal employee (Jezebel) he shares a squalid apartment with, delivering a performance that is sensual, supportive, but somehow malignant, poisoned, fervid and diseased. Danny Aiello is solid, as always, in an intriguing role as Robbins's masseur; even Seinfeld star Jason Alexander has a small part as an intimidated attorney trying to help Robbins and his fellow veterans make sense of their damnation.But good acting aside, the real star of Jacob's Ladder is the cinematography (Jeff Kimball, whose work here gave him a crack at ""True Romance"" and ""Mission Impossible 2"") and the malignant atmosphere. The onslaught of horrific, initially subtle, and truly nasty images that Lyne cooks up rank as some of the more unsettling in horror film history, and the sleazy, decrepit New York of the 1970's accentuates the film's nastiness and adds to the film's edginess.Jacob's Ladder is like waking up in an unfamiliar bed, getting a blast of mace in the face, and then being dumped in a bathtub full of ice by unfriendly, anonymous hands---all in inky darkness---only to hear the whine of a buzzsaw in the dark reaches of the night.Enjoy.JSG",5,Heaven and Hell,1112486400,"04 3,

Tim Robbins is superbly understated as the gentle protagonist Jacob Singer, ripped from the bosom of his family and planted in the hell that was Vietnam.After his return from Vietnam, Jacob is plagued by distressing hallucinations, portentous dreams and encounters with mysterious men which invariably end in violence. The narrative constantly shifts between the &quot;present&quot;, Vietnam and Jacob's life before Vietnam, and has the effect of destabilising the logic of the film so that ambiguity creeps into all aspects and a menacing air of uncertainty pervades the action - is Jacob hallucinating or really seeing monsters? What exactly happened to him in Vietnam? Are his memories accurate or have they been distorted by his experiences?Adrian Lynes' meditation on the nature of the past contains echoes of Proust - memories are all we have, but can they ever faithfully reflect what happened, or are they inevitably coloured by the events that succeed them? The fact that the director is English is, I think, an important point. As an outsider he brings a different perspective to Vietnam (similar to Alan Parker's excellent Birdie) that is more circumspect than the views of, say, Oliver Stone or Francis Coppola.The film's ending is shocking, but I would argue that it is rather more ambiguous than most reviewers assume. If you read it one way then yes, it does undermine the rest of the film. But I don't think Lyne intended it literally: if you accept that what happens is symbolic, then it makes a lot more sense, and can be taken to mean several things, none of which subverts the film's message: that unspeakable things happened in Vietnam that its survivors will go to any lengths to try to forget, and that the US government acted with astonishing dishonesty, hypocrisy and evil intent in what it did, not just to the Vietcong, but to its own troops. Jacob's Ladder is as powerful a film in its own way as Apocalypse Now was, though maybe its resonance was not as powerful at the time of its release. From a distance of a decade or more, however, the film has not diminished in any way and stands as a powerful testament to the way in which that terrible conflict burned into America's collective psyche and altered its view of itself irrevocably.",5,"Disturbing, chilling take on the illusion of reality",997660800,"08 13, 2001",2001,2626,"['Taking', 'theme', 'more', 'less', 'accepted', 'theory', 'US', 'government', 'experimented', 'hallucinogenic', 'substances', 'troops', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'effort', 'quot', 'improve', 'quot', 'performance', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'film', 'contradictions', 'surprises', 'hallucinogens', 'disorienting', 'confusing', 'frightening', 'viewer', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'superbly', 'understated', 'gentle', 'protagonist', 'Jacob', 'Singer', 'ripped', 'bosom', 'family', 'planted', 'hell', 'was', 'Vietnam.After', 'return', 'Vietnam', 'Jacob', 'plagued', 'distressing', 'hallucinations', 'portentous', 'dreams', 'encounters', 'mysterious', 'men', 'invariably', 'end', 'violence', 'narrative', 'constantly', 'shifts', 'quot', 'present', 'quot', 'Vietnam', 'Jacob', 'life', 'Vietnam', 'effect', 'destabilising', 'logic', 'film', 'ambiguity', 'aspects', 'menacing', 'air', 'uncertainty', 'action', 'Jacob', 'hallucinating', 'really', 'seeing', 'monsters', 'What', 'exactly', 'happened', 'Vietnam', 'Are', 'memories', 'accurate', 'have', 'been', 'distorted', 'experiences', 'Adrian', 'Lynes', 'meditation', 'nature', 'past', 'contains', 'echoes', 'Proust', 'memories', 'are', 'have', 'can', 'ever', 'faithfully', 'reflect', 'what', 'happened', 'are', 'inevitably', 'coloured', 'events', 'succeed', 'fact', 'director', 'English', 'think', 'important', 'point', 'outsider', 'different', 'perspective', 'Vietnam', 'similar', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'excellent', 'Birdie', 'more', 'circumspect', 'views', 'say', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Francis', 'Coppola.The', 'film', 'ending', 'shocking', 'would', 'argue', 'rather', 'more', 'ambiguous', 'most', 'reviewers', 'assume', 'read', 'one', 'way', 'then', 'yes', 'undermine', 'rest', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Lyne', 'intended', 'literally', 'accept', 'what', 'symbolic', 'then', 'lot', 'more', 'sense', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'mean', 'several', 'things', 'none', 'film', 'message', 'unspeakable', 'things', 'happened', 'Vietnam', 'survivors', 'will', 'go', 'lengths', 'try', 'forget', 'US', 'government', 'acted', 'astonishing', 'dishonesty', 'hypocrisy', 'evil', 'intent', 'what', 'did', 'not', 'just', 'Vietcong', 'own', 'troops', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'as', 'powerful', 'film', 'own', 'way', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'was', 'maybe', 'resonance', 'was', 'not', 'powerful', 'time', 'release', 'distance', 'decade', 'more', 'however', 'film', 'not', 'diminished', 'way', 'powerful', 'testament', 'way', 'terrible', 'conflict', 'burned', 'America', 'collective', 'psyche', 'altered', 'view', 'irrevocably']",N/A

74601,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,0784011168,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[17, 59]","When I first read the reviews for ""Jacob's Ladder"", I thought I was in for a good scary movie and psychological thriller.  What I ended up getting instead was an overrated ""blow your mind"" or ""far out"" movie.  The movie was nonsensical and over the top/ridiculous.  There are a couple of decent moments in this movie, but by and large, this movie is extremely overrated; and to be quite frank, in most instances, ""Jacob's Ladder"" is pure rubbish...I must admit that I was disappointed.Simply put, ""Jacob's Ladder"" is basically someone's interpretation of the chaos, turmoil and darkness involved during the act of dying.  This movie is an extremists' movie and is more philosophical than horror based.  I think the big problem I had with this movie was the fact that everyone seemed to think this movie was so scary or should be characterized as part of the horror film genre...clearly, this film has no business being characterized as cinematic horror.  For some, this will be just fine, but I am only writing this review as a reaction to some people's misperception as to the qualities of this movie as horror cinema.  Surely, fear is in the eye of the beholder...what scares some will not scare others and vice versa, but there are some universal fears and horrors which are clearly not addressed by this film.Still, the creators of ""Jacob's Ladder"" paint a dark picture of one stepping outside one's self during one's dying moments, but in the end, what has ultimately happened is nothing.  Hence, ""Jacob's Ladder"" is like that really weird dream you have or maybe even nightmare, but if you're already dead or dying, what difference does it make?  Basic fear of dying is a rather poor subject matter from which a horror movie can be derived.  The end result is a thought provoking movie a bit on the depressing side, but not a horror movie.Indeed, one could certainly argue that ""Jacob's Ladder"" is a thought provoking movie if nothing else, but overall, the movie simply just doesn't get off the ground or have enough cohesiveness to evoke fear in a sophisticated horror movie audience...random events with symbolic meanings only go so far and usually show an inherent weakness in the plot that is trying to be glossed over by the directors and writers.  Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention the ending which is very predictable and a fitting end to a sorry excuse for a ""horror movie"", if one can call it that at all.  In particular, I thought the dancing scene with the girl that turns into a lizard monster was absolutely ridiculous and completely inept at evoking horror in a sophisticated horror movie audience.For all of you horror movie fans who regularly read my reviews, you know me to tell it like it is and notwithstanding this movie's overwhelming reviews and popularity, I do not recommend ""Jacob's Ladder"" as a horror movie at all because when it comes down to its merits as a horror movie, ""Jacob's Ladder"" sucks.  Folks, it depends on what you're looking for, but if you're looking for a good scary flick or horror movie, do not rent or buy this trash...if you're looking for a ridiculous and over the top movie that might be good while smoking a joint, check out ""Jacob's Ladder"" and you might find it interesting, but you might also find making a fence with pancakes interesting too.

It deals with a real fact, the use of hallucenogenic drugs in the US army during the Vietnam war. But we never know, till the end maybe, whether we see reality or a dying dream. It has the look of a thriller and also of a horror film, and yet it is not. It deals with the capability for a dying man to come to terms with death itself. To resist death transforms dying into a fight with demons. To accept death transforms dying into a trip with angels. The moral of the lesson is thus very pessimistic in a way, since we must accept death to die smoothly. It is also optimistic since we can die smoothly if we accept death. It is all a question of from what point of view we look at death : acceptable or inacceptable. Yet a strange question remains : aren't humans supposed to fight for survival, to fight for life ? And there the question is terrible, horrific, horrifying : an individual cannot fight for survival because society, in this case the US armed forces, the government decide whether we have to live or we have to die. We are playthings in the hands of a few bureaucrats of war. At least that was what the Vietnam war transformed plain citizens into. They could have had peaceful and happy lives, but some blind and invisible forces decided otherwise. We had to submit, we have to submit. The film itself does not answer the question that rises then : Why do we have to submit to these forces ? Why are there forces like those imposing onto us decisions that are not our own ?

74618,A1VZLLDNLURGJB,0784011168,Keith Mirenberg,"[2, 2]","I am happy to say that Jacob's Ladder was well received by fans of the horror movie genre.  It is a visually and emotionally painful film to watch and the overall impression it made on me in the theater is difficult to describe.  During the roller coaster ride of a very original plot my feelings ranged from terror to joy, hopefulness to hopelessness, a sense of rebellion then resignation, and ultimately surprise colored by bitter-sweet sadness.In my opinion it is one of the best horror movies ever made and when watching it you will experience many emotions.  This wide range of feelings is unusual for a horror movie to evoke and what places this movie in a class by itself.On a personal note, one evening while walking my son and daughter-in-law home on the West Side of Manhattan, they pointed out the lonely but lovely entrance to Jacob's apartment.  I thought my son was just making a joke and merely identified a similar looking apartment. No, there before me on the quiet and dark West Side of Manhattan was the on-site filming location selected by the makers of the film for Jacob to achieve rest from his long terrible torment and at last be reunited with his young son.This film pre-dates the current high standards for movie special effects and film magic visual imagery.  Notwithstanding, it provides many very original images and special effects which kept me riveted to my seat.It is interesting that CINEFANTASTIQUE indicated in an article on this film that the script could not find a backing studio for years and it was voted one of the best movie scripts to come along in years prior to being made into a movie.

I knew so many people who served in Vietnam or managed to get out of it in various ways, or who died there, and I can still recall watching POWs arrive at the military hospital where I worked in the early 70s.  I remember how terribly unpopular the war was, and how it ultimately killed Lyndon Johnson.  Over 58,000 Americans died in Vietnam, and there were probably more drugs used by soldiers just to get themselves through their tours of duty than in any other war.  So I could relate to this film and Jacob's agony.Unlike some reviewers, I figured out early on what was happening to Jacob, so for me, the ending was not a big surprise, although the specifics were not clear until late in the film.  But even knowing what was coming, I found the film fascinating, frightening, infuriating, sometimes confusing, but impossible to stop watching.

74624,A2POOF4Y2VDLHM,0784011168,"""manalone923""","[10, 12]","First of all, I don't mean to sound holier-than-thou, but a GREAT many reviews of this film give away the entire ending to the film, even if they liked it!  I'm not one of that camp, and greatly respect the others here who didn't overindulge their need for analysis in such a revealing way.  Ok now with that out of the way, I'll say that Jacob's Ladder is, primarily, a drama, the story of Jacob, a Vietnam vet who is beginning to have troubling nightmares and hallucenations in which his real world is abruptly visited by what appear to be demons.  This is where the scares are genuinely startling, enough to classify this film generically as a horror flick even though it isn't at all.  You see, the demons Jacob sees appear utterly at random, at any time of day or night, in places safe and otherwise.  And he doesn't see them with such regularity that they become boring to the viewer.  Rather, they look like humans one second and then suddenly in the next frame they have abruptly become human only in appearance but with frightening features such as grotesque twitching movements and uninvited facial distortions.  Describing it can't give it justice, you have to see them and the great editing techniques in which they are shown to see why they're truly so startling.  The creatures are seen so suddenly without any tense musical buildup or cue, and usually also after enough normal time has passed, so when they do appear it's such a jarring shock that our reactions of fright aptly mirror those of Jacob himself.  Well, once he sees these demons, Jacob tries to figure out what's wrong with him, since he has also been slipping into dreamlike episodes in which he can't tell (nor can we) if he is living or dead, asleep or awake, and which time frame is the real one.  It is a confusing film in the storytelling structure, because it cuts back and forth between several apparently different times of Jake's life in which he has, alternately, 2 different wives and a son who is alive at one time and dead at another.  The viewer doesn't know initially why Jacob is seeing things, when he's dreaming or not, and which of the lives he's experiencing is the real one.  This is a storytelling choice, and it works.  Don't worry, you won't be alone because all throughout the film Jake is asking himself why he's seeing things, why he keeps remembering earlier times with his 1st wife (or dreaming of a different life with a second wife), and what is real.  Rest assured that by the end of the film you ARE given an ultimate answer that does make sense, but it's been argued that it's the weakest, &quot;letdown&quot; aspect of the movie.  I heartily disagree because the ending is one of the several possible outcomes that are hinted at during the film, and I can assume that it was considered a letdown by some because they were hoping for something more profound, or possibly less profound depending on their tastes.  But don't worry, I'm not trying to confuse you.  As a whole, the movie is a quiet drama in which we follow along with Jacob, trying to figure out why he's seeing what he's seeing, and by the end we do get an absolute answer.  It's worth viewing as a horror film as well (though I've pointed out I don't think of it as one) because the moments of shock and horror, and more than anything, just general creepiness, will linger with you for a while.  Moments in a subway, a hospital, and (to me) the most disturbing scene in an alleyway will stick with you, and are echoed in films like Session 9 and the Silent Hill video game series (though in Session 9 the threats are far more unseen).  If you've had enough patience to read to the end of this, I do urge you to watch this movie objectively, not worrying what the ending will be but instead putting yourself alongside Jacob and trying to digest the info you're being given.  Hopefully by the end you'll feel that the last link was completed, and at the very least, you should have had a good chill or 2 down your spine.PS, IMPORTANT:  Please note that while the Jacob's Ladder special edition dvd DOES contain the features listed in the Amazon description, those features ARE NOT listed on the dvd packaging.  Don't worry, if you get that creepy dvd with an appropriately blurry Tim Robbins on the cover and the words &quot;Special edition&quot;, you got the right disc.

74627,AST7UNIXVOAVA,0784011168,Mark Shanks,"[220, 241]","I wonder if this movie could be made today - after all, it doesn't have any computer-generated special effects, it demands the viewer's complete attention, and really needs to be seen more than once to appreciate fully  the meaning of all of the scenes. Incredible too is that the writer (Bruce  Joel Rubin) was working on the filming of this and his more popular movie  &quot;Ghost&quot; at the same time. Director Adrian Lynne wisely avoided  some of the more sacharrine touches that Rubin had in the original script  (such as the view of &quot;Heaven&quot;) and added many subtle disturbing  elements of his own. The final result is a film that you will think about  long after you see it, a man's journey through the bardo state to his final  enlightenment. In a way, this is the cinematic equivalent of a Pettersson  symphony - an emotional catharsis after the long, dark night of the soul.  I'm not ashamed to say that I cry like a baby every time I watch  it.Comparisons with Bierce's &quot;Occurrance at Owl Creek Bridge&quot;  and &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; are inevitable and not out of place, but  &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; has more layers than either of those and  ambitiously takes on the psychological layers of one man's life, the  tension between the comforts of home, wife and family and the unfufilled  desires he harbors.There are some violent scenes and very disturbing  imagery throughout the movie; after all, it *is* about war, fear, and  death. However, none of it is gratuitous, and the use of strobe lighting,  quick cuts, and odd camera angles keep the viewer from being able to see  anything definite. But don't say you weren't warned....The DVD's  documentary and deleted scenes, along with the director's commentary, will  enable the first-time viewer to get a more complete idea of what is  happening. I've watched this film at least a dozen times, and never fail to  see something new in it each time. Sound and image quality are  excellent.This one isn't for casual viewing; it is *certainly* not a  Saturday-night time killer, nor is it a &quot;horror&quot; movie in the  standard sense of the term.

It seemed like something I would like.  Nothing could prepare me for what I was about to see; good and bad.  All I can say is that this movie was certainly different than what I was expecting.  It is a unique and confusing film that leaves us hanging until the very unexpected ending.  (Some said they knew it was going to end that way, but it certainly caught me off guard.)Don't worry, I won't give away anything in this review.  Be careful when you read the others because I have found that they give away the ending.  Luckily I saw it before I read them.  This movie is about a man named, Jacob Singer.  Jacob is a Vietnam Veteran who just wants to live a normal life and work like everybody else does.  But something strange has been happening to him.  He is starting to see things; things that nightmares are made of.  Strange demons and disturbing visuals keep haunting him day in and day out, and eventually it gets so bad that he can't determine what is real and what is not.  The only thing he can know for sure is something strange happened that night when he was fighting in Vietnam.  Was he part of an experiment that alters his mind and forces him to hallucinate, or has he just truly lost his grip or reality?  What is real and what is not?  You'll have to find out for yourself.This movie mixes psychological thriller with drama and with film noir.  It is a very dark, confusing, and even a depressing film to watch, but it was very well written and directed.  The visuals that we are given, in a time where we didn't have the technological advances that we do now, are disturbing but breathtaking.  We are put in a dilemma in which we the audience are just as confused as the protagonist and cannot distinguish what is real and what is not.  We actually get to go through exactly what Jacob is experiencing.There are a few extras on the DVD, but not that much.  And because of how old the movie is, the video quality isn't the best.  Maybe they'll attempt to restore is someday and give it some other extras that could help enrich the movie even more.All in all, this was a pretty good movie.  Not the best, and certainly one I wouldn't want to see over and over again.  This is one I cannot promise that you will like.  You'll defiantly want to rent this one first before purchasing.  &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; is a one of a kind movie that will take you on a journey of going through Hell and back, and make you feel just as confused as Jacob Singer feels.

74634,A2M1N8G4W4END8,0784011168,Michael R Gates,"[2, 2]","This opus from director Adrian Lyne and screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin is a compelling cinematic Rubik's Cube that twists, turns, revolves, and sometimes confuses as it moves towards its inevitable solution.  Often described--and sometimes criticized--as a grimmer Vietnam-based interpretation of Ambrose Bierce's short story ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,"" it would be more accurate to consider it a hallucinogenic ""re-imagining"" of Herk Harvey's classic horror film CARNIVAL OF SOULS (1962).  As with the earlier film, JACOB'S LADDER offers numerous clues to its ""surprise"" climax interspersed amongst its bizarre action and eerie, disturbing imagery.The film opens in 1971 in Vietnam as an American platoon is attacked under very strange circumstances.  Zip ahead to present-day New York where Jacob (Tim Robbins), a GI wounded in the aforementioned assault, is a mailman suffering from hallucinations--or are they visions?--in which various demons seem to be trying to kill him.  Could these increasingly horrific hallucinations be the result of a covert government experiment in Vietnam gone awry, or is Jacob simply losing his mind?As the titular character, Tim Robbins delivers a riveting and affecting performance, arguably one of the best of his career.  Performances from the supporting cast are strong, too, especially those from Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a, who portrays Jacob's pretty live-in girlfriend; Danny Aiello, playing Jacob's sage chiropractor; Matt Craven, portraying a government chemist who clues Jacob in on the fact that the government used GIs as guinea pigs in Vietnam; and comedic actor Jason Alexander, famous now for his role as George Costanza on TV's SEINFELD, who does an excellent job here in a dramatic role as a smarmy lawyer.The DVD edition of JACOB'S LADDER from Artisan Entertainment offers a fairly clean digital transfer of the film in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (enhanced for widescreen TVs).  In addition, the cool bonus features include an optional feature commentary with director Adrian Lyne, a making-of featurette, and a few deleted scenes.With its more restrained and psychological approach to horror, JACOB'S LADDER is an intelligent yet frequently disturbing film that stays with the viewer long after the credits roll.

Listen to what the characters say.  Don't take the Nam sequences as necessarily absolute truth.Among thr DVD extras are various cut scenes; i'm glad that they were cut, as thry seem to tend to both cater to the &quot;gross out horror&quot; element and to literalise certain aspects of the film that i'm just as happy to have left at least partly obscure and metaphorical.In fact, there are a few places where i might cut a bit more, if only for pace -- the gurney sequence, after Jacob is ordered taken to X-Ray from the Emergency Room, is too long and somewhat repetitive; i would guess it could be shortend by a third or more without negatively affecting the story and with amarked improvement of the rather glacially-slow pacing of that part of the film.Tim Robbins gives Jacob an appropriately befuddled face, and Danny Aiello is his usual more-than-competent self as an oracular-sounding chiropracter.Not necessariy a film for those who like everything neatly explained and all the back story available before the end, this is still a thought-provoking and disturbing little exercise in the dark side.",4,Climbing the Ladder,1010966400,"01 14, 2002",2002,2069,"['wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'level', 'spoiler', 'virtually', 'other', 'reviewer', 'compelled', 'use', 'film', 'be', 'experienced', 'as', 'little', 'foreknowledge', 'quot', 'meaning', 'quot', 'final', 'revelation', 'possible.I', 'remember', 'being', 'Very', 'Angry', 'Newsweek', 'reviewer', 'when', 'mentioned', 'title', 'classic', 'story', 'review', 'result', 'completely', 'telegraphing', 'end', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'recognised', 'title', 'mentioned.As', 'non-combat', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'veteran', 'i', 'can', 'attest', 'film', 'makers', 'catch', 'mood', 'feelings', 'sizeable', 'percentage', 'Nam', 'vets', 'pretty', 'well.The', 'overall', 'mood', 'building', 'confusion', 'dread', 'paranoia', 'Jacob', 'Singer', 'life', 'more', 'more', 'strange', 'menacing', 'well', 'handled', 'Jacob', 'suffering', 'sort', 'bizarre', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'disorder', 'something', 'more', 'few', 'hints', 'Think', 'carefully', 'references', 'appearances', 'storyline', 'Jacob', 'dead', 'son', 'Listen', 'what', 'characters', 'say', 'Do', ""n't"", 'take', 'Nam', 'necessarily', 'absolute', 'truth.Among', 'thr', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'various', 'cut', 'scenes', 'i', ""'m"", 'glad', 'were', 'cut', 'thry', 'seem', 'tend', 'cater', 'quot', 'gross', 'horror', 'quot', 'element', 'literalise', 'certain', 'aspects', 'film', ""'m"", 'just', 'as', 'happy', 'have', 'left', 'least', 'partly', 'obscure', 'metaphorical.In', 'fact', 'are', 'few', 'places', 'where', 'i', 'might', 'cut', 'bit', 'more', 'only', 'pace', 'gurney', 'sequence', 'Jacob', 'ordered', 'taken', 'X-Ray', 'Emergency', 'Room', 'too', 'long', 'somewhat', 'repetitive', 'i', 'would', 'guess', 'could', 'be', 'shortend', 'third', 'more', 'negatively', 'affecting', 'story', 'amarked', 'improvement', 'rather', 'glacially-slow', 'pacing', 'part', 'film.Tim', 'Robbins', 'Jacob', 'appropriately', 'befuddled', 'face', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'usual', 'more-than-competent', 'self', 'oracular-sounding', 'chiropracter.Not', 'film', 'who', 'everything', 'neatly', 'explained', 'back', 'story', 'available', 'end', 'still', 'thought-provoking', 'disturbing', 'little', 'exercise', 'dark', 'side']",N/A

Which is understandable because Jacob's Ladder is too dark and cerebral to appeal to a wide audience. It also straddles several genres: war, horror and thriller. In broad strokes the plot is about a Vietnam vet (Tim Robbins) who returns home to his job as a postal worker only to find himself experiencing nightmarish hallucinations. He starts trouble-shooting the problem only to uncover a top-level military conspiracy...or does he? Fantastic effects that still look fantastic today, 354 years later. Danny Aiello co-stars as the good chiropodist and the gorgeous Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a plays Jacob's seriously hot girlfriend Jezabelle. This is an unsettling, nightmarish but very satisfying, extremely well made film. I've watched it twice and I enjoyed it more on second viewing.

74639,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,0784011168,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[61, 68]","Jacob's Ladder open's with New York postal worker Jacob Singer waking on a subway train having just experienced a nightmare flashback to his time in Vietnam. Upset and confused he tries to ask his fellow passengers if he has missed his stop but as he passes them he sees flashes of tails and horns in the uncommunicative people whom he approaches for help. Exiting the train he finds the stairs to the subway locked and on crossing the tracks he narrowly misses being hit by a train coming in the other direction and whilst lying on the track he witnesses yet more disturbing images as the train passes by. Unsure whether these images are real or as a result of some form of post traumatic stress disorder from his time in `Nam, he struggles to keep his grip on sanity as his life becomes a nightmare, with his days punctuated by visions of demons, his first wife and his dead son. His life begins to unravel and the line between reality and delusion becomes ever more fragile.This is, in my opinion, by far and away Adrian Lyne's best movie, which may surprise some people given the fact his CV includes big box office hits such as 9  Weeks, Indecent Proposal and Fatal Attraction. His direction is subtle, considered, well-paced and as near as you'll get to perfect. The cinematography is also excellent and the use of special effects are relatively understated but effective, which is something that can rarely be said since the advent of CGI. As for Bruce Joel Rubin's screenplay no praise is too high. It is intelligent, intricate and complex and it keeps you guessing until the end. In fact there is so much in this movie that second time around you'll find yourself picking up clues that you missed first time around and appreciate the cleverness and different levels of the story even more. Tim Robbins is excellent as Jacob, whom he succeeds in making a very sympathetic and vulnerable character, whose life literally becomes  a nightmare. The supporting cast is excellent too with Elizabeth Pena (La Bamba, Rush Hour etc) and Danny Aiello (Leon, Do The Right Thing) in particular putting in notable performances. Jacob's Ladder also features supporting performances from Matt Craven (The Life of David Gale), Jason Alexander (Seinfeld) and Eriq La Salle (ER).I first saw Jacob's Ladder at the cinema when it first opened back in 1990. I had read an article about it in a magazine, which was complete with disturbing still photographs from the movie. The article was intriguing in that it said that the screenplay, written by Bruce Joel Rubin (Ghost) had been doing the rounds in Hollywood for several years but that although everybody agreed it was an excellent screenplay it had been considered unfilmable until Director Adrian Lyne got hold of it. On the day before seeing `Jacobs Ladder', for the first time, a review in the now defunct British newspaper `Today' described it as a five star classic and I still remember watching it in the cinema on its opening night, transfixed by the story and disturbed by the images, whilst jumping out of my seat a few times. I have loved this movie ever since and have loaned out my old VHS copy many times since then but what still surprises me is that so few people seem to know this movie or have seen this movie, which to me seems like a crime.Perhaps Jacobs Ladder's lack of box office success can be put down to it often being classified as a horror movie, which is to do it an enormous disservice. Sure there are elements of Jacob's Ladder that can be compared to the horror genre but it is so much more than that.

Danny Aiello as your chiropractor trying to explain life and death and existence is enough to both laugh at and find hilarious.The whole movie flirts and eventually decides on the premise that we all make decisions, even teh relaly big ones about life and death and whether or not to accept it.  (Similar to the Tananarive Due book The Between).  However this movie asks you to take a simple precept: that your whole life flashes before yoru eyes when you die and accept it.  But at the same time it also forces you to understand that your whole life includes the possibilities that it could've been had you not died.  See that's where it all gets freaky and the remote control is tossed over your shoulder and you shake your head.But think on it.What of the millions of dead just within the last century, what would've become of them had they lived.  How many Beethovens or Baldwins or Hawkings would've been birthed by the dead?  Okay, suppose even further that you got to see/project onto this screen of possibility and that's where Jacob's Ladder picks up from.Except it takes a normal man and allows him (the real question is whether it's his mind and his body or only his mind) to slip though the cracks in death, to reject the dissolution of form to body and instead ressurrect himself in form and thought.  See, now you're tossing the movie box cover because there is an allusion to Jesus Christ and Dante's Inferno and the concept that our last fear is death but not of dying, the physical thought of death but accepting that life is over.  We can imagine an injury in war, as happens here but we can't accept the thought that the show's over on this plane of existence, no matter who comes to try and get you to accept it----your dead child, a chiropractor/angel, demons.  Because teh movie kind of alludes to the concept that we leave breadcrumbs, spritiual ones throughout our life and good and evil track us by them.  The more powerful you conceive of, or perhaps actualize yourself as the greater possibility that your demons are gonna come for you.The movie is not so much of an enigma as three questions lined up.  If you give it over to the first then you have to take the next leaps.Question 1: What if &quot;death&quot; through some kind of medical experimentation/cosmic fluke became a choice?Question 2: Who would be &quot;sent&quot; to get you to accept death?Question 3: What would you have created in life during the time that you were to be dead?You can also say that there's the question of who's imagining what here as the character's perceptions of reality overlap to the point of this movie needing a second viewing.  But each time you watch it ask your a different question.  What if he's dead?  What if the experimentation saved his life?  What if this is his thought projection about the last bits of his life, its possibilities?A super film.",5,"Terrific movie, director and star with a powerful story",1010620800,"01 10, 2002",2002,3009,"['Jacob', 'Ladder', 'tough', 'film', 'want', 'simple', 'ending', 'want', 'be', 'contrite', 'plausible', 'movie', 'anything', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'chiropractor', 'trying', 'explain', 'life', 'death', 'existence', 'enough', 'laugh', 'find', 'hilarious.The', 'whole', 'movie', 'flirts', 'eventually', 'decides', 'premise', 'make', 'decisions', 'even', 'teh', 'relaly', 'big', 'ones', 'life', 'death', 'not', 'accept', 'Similar', 'Tananarive', 'Due', 'book', 'Between', 'However', 'movie', 'take', 'simple', 'precept', 'whole', 'life', 'flashes', 'yoru', 'eyes', 'when', 'die', 'accept', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'understand', 'whole', 'life', 'possibilities', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'had', 'not', 'died', 'See', 'where', 'freaky', 'remote', 'control', 'tossed', 'shoulder', 'shake', 'head.But', 'think', 'it.What', 'millions', 'dead', 'just', 'last', 'century', 'what', 'would', ""'ve"", 'become', 'had', 'lived', 'How', 'many', 'Beethovens', 'Baldwins', 'Hawkings', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'birthed', 'dead', 'Okay', 'suppose', 'even', 'further', 'got', 'see/project', 'screen', 'possibility', 'where', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'up', 'normal', 'man', 'real', 'question', 'mind', 'body', 'only', 'mind', 'slip', 'cracks', 'death', 'reject', 'dissolution', 'form', 'body', 'instead', 'ressurrect', 'form', 'thought', 'See', 'now', ""'re"", 'tossing', 'movie', 'box', 'cover', 'allusion', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Dante', 'Inferno', 'concept', 'last', 'fear', 'death', 'not', 'dying', 'physical', 'thought', 'death', 'accepting', 'life', 'can', 'imagine', 'injury', 'war', 'happens', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'thought', 'show', 'over', 'plane', 'existence', 'matter', 'who', 'try', 'get', 'accept', 'dead', 'child', 'chiropractor/angel', 'demons', 'teh', 'movie', 'kind', 'alludes', 'concept', 'leave', 'breadcrumbs', 'spritiual', 'ones', 'life', 'good', 'evil', 'track', 'more', 'powerful', 'conceive', 'perhaps', 'actualize', 'greater', 'possibility', 'demons', 'are', 'gon', 'come', 'you.The', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'enigma', 'three', 'questions', 'lined', 'up', 'give', 'first', 'then', 'have', 'take', 'next', 'leaps.Question', '1', 'What', 'quot', 'death', 'quot', 'kind', 'medical', 'experimentation/cosmic', 'fluke', 'became', 'choice', 'Question', '2', 'Who', 'would', 'be', 'quot', 'sent', 'quot', 'get', 'accept', 'death', 'Question', '3', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'created', 'life', 'time', 'were', 'be', 'dead', 'can', 'also', 'say', 'question', 'who', 'imagining', 'what', 'here', 'character', 'perceptions', 'reality', 'overlap', 'point', 'movie', 'needing', 'second', 'viewing', 'time', 'watch', 'ask', 'different', 'question', 'What', 'dead', 'What', 'experimentation', 'saved', 'life', 'What', 'thought', 'projection', 'last', 'bits', 'life', 'possibilities', 'super', 'film']",N/A

Which is his real life? That we are never quitesure of as he moves from one life to another. Nor are wecompletely sure about the people in Jake's lives as someof them seem to be demons, out to destroy him.He sees them on the subway car, he sees one in the VA's office,and he sees them as they try to run over him with a car, andeventually Jake is so confused he doubts the existence of hisgirl Jezzie. He gets even more confused when he and his ex-Army buddies try to hire a lawyer to find out what has beengoing on with the death of one of his friends, only for thelawyer to reject him on the grounds that SInger was never inthe Army.Was Jake in the Army? Was he and his friends part of secretexperiment conducted by the Army? Which life is real-- the onewith Jezzie or the one with his ex-wife Sarah? Jake's struggleto determine what's real and what's not leads him to a startlingand unexpected conclusion that I won't spoil for folks whohaven't seen this intriguing film.Usually we get alternate endings on DVD's like this, but in thiscase we get only a few cut scenes along with the director'scommentary that really doesn't explain much if anything at all,except for one scene that suggests Jake's problems with thedemons were chemically induced, but in the end, that doesn'treally matter a whole lot.

We know all too smugly that everything stands for something else and nothing else and everything else EXCEPT itself simultaneously, we know the inherent limits of language and meaning and representation, we strain their fault-lines and resources the same way we gobble up the environment, and our linguistic/literary sh*t is equally toxic as what we dump into the rivers.That said, we come from a long tradition of allegory -- it's half of how we learn as children, our moral and religious and social codes are steeped in it, and on those rare occasions when it manages to fool our jaded know-it-all post-post-modern sensibilities for long enough to work, it's powerful stuff.And that's where Jacob's Ladder is so incredible. I don't want to argue about what it's an allegory for -- I've heard divinity students deconstruct it down to a heaped alphabet of Judeo-Christian symbolism. I'm neither a Jew nor a Christian myself, and to me the allegory seemed to be not incredibly far off, in essence, from Albert Camus' novel &quot;A Happy Death&quot; -- that is, it's about the fight to die well -- to die properly by one's own standards -- we all die, sooner or later -- but Jacob's journey always seemed like one of exhausting all the possibilities of self and will and memory, all the conflicting attachments and desires and forces and fears within himself, especially as manifested in women (Sarah is what he has, Jezebel is what he lusts after, what he feels the lack of) and in father/son relationships, distilling this down to a place/persona of pure light or goodness or whatever you want to call it, from which he can leave in a form/manner/direction appropriate to his own soul.The seamless narrative non-linear GnipGnop of time-slices is what makes it all possible. Camera work and editing are exquisite as well. Tim Robbins looks uncannily like the young Warren Zevon throughout much of the film. Only the hospital basement sequence turned me off -- the paranoid camera angles, focusing on the helplessly spinning dolly wheels squelching over ruined tiles and moist gobbets of human flesh, only barely redeem a sequence more in keeping with the schlocky self-indulgence of Pink Floyd's &quot;the Wall.&quot;The DVD is well worth getting for the little &quot;Making Of...&quot; documentary at the end and all the unused footage.Interesting to watch back-to-back with &quot;The Fisher King.&quot;",4,Who'd've ever imagined Danny Aiello quoting Meister Eckhart?,957139200,"05 1, 2000",2000,2542,"['do', ""n't"", 'think', 'very', 'many', 'people', 'realize', 'how', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'convincingly', 'successfully', 'pull', 'off', 'pure', 'allegory', 'time', 'know', 'too', 'smugly', 'everything', 'stands', 'something', 'else', 'nothing', 'else', 'everything', 'else', 'EXCEPT', 'simultaneously', 'know', 'inherent', 'limits', 'language', 'meaning', 'representation', 'strain', 'fault-lines', 'resources', 'same', 'way', 'gobble', 'up', 'environment', 'linguistic/literary', 'sh*t', 'equally', 'toxic', 'what', 'dump', 'rivers.That', 'said', 'come', 'long', 'tradition', 'allegory', 'half', 'how', 'learn', 'children', 'moral', 'religious', 'social', 'codes', 'are', 'steeped', 'rare', 'occasions', 'when', 'fool', 'jaded', 'know-it-all', 'post-post-modern', 'sensibilities', 'long', 'enough', 'work', 'powerful', 'stuff.And', 'where', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'so', 'incredible', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'argue', 'what', 'allegory', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'divinity', 'students', 'deconstruct', 'down', 'heaped', 'alphabet', 'Judeo-Christian', 'symbolism', ""'m"", 'Jew', 'Christian', 'myself', 'allegory', 'seemed', 'be', 'not', 'incredibly', 'far', 'off', 'essence', 'Albert', 'Camus', 'novel', 'quot', 'A', 'Happy', 'Death', 'quot', 'fight', 'die', 'well', 'die', 'properly', 'one', 'own', 'standards', 'die', 'sooner', 'later', 'Jacob', 'journey', 'always', 'seemed', 'one', 'exhausting', 'possibilities', 'self', 'will', 'memory', 'conflicting', 'attachments', 'desires', 'forces', 'fears', 'especially', 'manifested', 'women', 'Sarah', 'what', 'Jezebel', 'what', 'what', 'lack', 'father/son', 'relationships', 'distilling', 'down', 'place/persona', 'pure', 'light', 'goodness', 'want', 'call', 'can', 'leave', 'form/manner/direction', 'appropriate', 'own', 'soul.The', 'seamless', 'narrative', 'non-linear', 'GnipGnop', 'time-slices', 'what', 'possible', 'Camera', 'work', 'editing', 'are', 'exquisite', 'well', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'uncannily', 'young', 'Warren', 'Zevon', 'much', 'film', 'Only', 'hospital', 'basement', 'sequence', 'turned', 'off', 'paranoid', 'camera', 'angles', 'focusing', 'helplessly', 'spinning', 'dolly', 'wheels', 'squelching', 'over', 'ruined', 'tiles', 'moist', 'gobbets', 'human', 'flesh', 'only', 'barely', 'redeem', 'sequence', 'more', 'keeping', 'schlocky', 'self-indulgence', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'quot', 'Wall.', 'quot', 'DVD', 'well', 'worth', 'getting', 'little', 'quot', 'Making', 'quot', 'documentary', 'end', 'unused', 'footage.Interesting', 'watch', 'back-to-back', 'quot', 'Fisher', 'King.', 'quot']",N/A

This is a film that gives you the impression that it was partly based on fact.Having myself dropped enough government manufactured pharmaceutical Quality LSD in 65, 66, there is a difference between the street stuff and the pharmaceutical stuff. The film starts out with the soldiers up in northern Vietnam taking a break eating their lunch and smoking weed. All of a sudden some are throwing up and going into convulsion's there was an attack at the same time by the NVA  (North Vietnamese Army). Jacob Singer Tim Robbins) wakes up in New York City, The wars over and he is married & working for the post Office, But he keeps having these Flash Backs on Vietnam and that there are people watching him, Hallucinations.He flash's back to when his young son was killed on his bike.He meets with his buddies that were in the same unit and they are having the same problems,They thought they were all going crazy, They are convinced the government put something into their food and they go and see a lawyer. Then they all start seeing the men in Black who are trying to shut them up or die.Jacob calls his lawyer and his lawyer says...You are all whacked out, I checked with the Army and they said none of you were in Vietnam. His buddies back out, they changed their mind and don't want to get involved.Jacob gets this phone call from a Chemist who got arrested for synthesizing LSD,the street stuff.I remember my friends and I had a saying back then...Anything less than pharmaceutical quality LSD was impure, Nobody made better LSD than the US government, They made the best. So the government says to the chemist, Either you come to Vietnam for one year and you synthesize a psycho-Active drug that reaches down into man's psyche and bring out his hate, his fear., his anger or go to prison for a long time. So he opts for the job and comes up with a drug he called ""The Ladder""  a Ladder straight down into the pits of Hell.So they tested it out on some rats and the rats just rip each other up into pieces.At the latter part of the war in the seventies we were losing the war, morale was very low with all the protests at home against the war the government wanted a drug that would bring out man's aggression.So the chemist tells Jacob that he created ""The Ladder"" A trip straight down into the pits of hell that they were worst than the rats, So Jacob says to him...You mean there was no assault from the NVA, and the chemist says, No man it was brother against brother, You killed each other, You were worst than the rats.The mind blower of the whole film is, He never went home, He died in Vietnam and had imagined this whole thing and then at the end when he dies the doctor says...The poor guy he fought a good fight. Then you see his son there to take him up to heaven.At the End of the Film, there a caption...""It was reported that the drug BZ was used on the troops in Vietnam?""",5,Jacobs Ladder-Fact or Fiction,1346284800,"08 30, 2012",2012,3017,"['one', 'be', 'seen', 'Do', 'not', 'read', 'review', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'was', 'over', 'Nam', 'august', '69', 'film', 'impression', 'was', 'partly', 'based', 'fact.Having', 'dropped', 'enough', 'government', 'manufactured', 'pharmaceutical', 'Quality', 'LSD', '65', '66', 'difference', 'street', 'stuff', 'pharmaceutical', 'stuff', 'film', 'out', 'soldiers', 'up', 'northern', 'Vietnam', 'taking', 'break', 'eating', 'lunch', 'smoking', 'weed', 'sudden', 'are', 'throwing', 'up', 'going', 'convulsion', 'was', 'attack', 'same', 'time', 'NVA', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'Army', 'Jacob', 'Singer', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'up', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'wars', 'married', 'working', 'post', 'Office', 'having', 'Flash', 'Backs', 'Vietnam', 'are', 'people', 'watching', 'Hallucinations.He', 'flash', 'back', 'when', 'young', 'son', 'was', 'killed', 'bike.He', 'meets', 'buddies', 'were', 'same', 'unit', 'are', 'having', 'same', 'problems', 'thought', 'were', 'going', 'crazy', 'are', 'convinced', 'government', 'put', 'something', 'food', 'go', 'see', 'lawyer', 'Then', 'start', 'seeing', 'men', 'Black', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'shut', 'up', 'die.Jacob', 'lawyer', 'lawyer', 'are', 'whacked', 'out', 'checked', 'Army', 'said', 'none', 'were', 'Vietnam', 'buddies', 'back', 'out', 'changed', 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'involved.Jacob', 'phone', 'call', 'Chemist', 'who', 'got', 'arrested', 'synthesizing', 'LSD', 'street', 'stuff.I', 'remember', 'friends', 'had', 'saying', 'back', 'then', 'Anything', 'less', 'pharmaceutical', 'quality', 'LSD', 'was', 'impure', 'Nobody', 'made', 'better', 'LSD', 'US', 'government', 'made', 'best', 'government', 'chemist', 'Either', 'come', 'Vietnam', 'one', 'year', 'synthesize', 'psycho-Active', 'drug', 'down', 'man', 'psyche', 'bring', 'out', 'hate', 'fear.', 'anger', 'go', 'prison', 'long', 'time', 'So', 'job', 'up', 'drug', 'called', 'Ladder', 'Ladder', 'straight', 'down', 'pits', 'Hell.So', 'tested', 'out', 'rats', 'rats', 'just', 'rip', 'other', 'up', 'latter', 'part', 'war', 'seventies', 'were', 'losing', 'war', 'morale', 'was', 'very', 'low', 'protests', 'home', 'war', 'government', 'wanted', 'drug', 'would', 'bring', 'out', 'man', 'chemist', 'Jacob', 'created', 'Ladder', 'trip', 'straight', 'down', 'pits', 'hell', 'were', 'worst', 'rats', 'So', 'Jacob', 'mean', 'was', 'assault', 'NVA', 'chemist', 'man', 'was', 'brother', 'brother', 'killed', 'other', 'were', 'worst', 'rats.The', 'mind', 'blower', 'whole', 'film', 'never', 'went', 'home', 'died', 'Vietnam', 'had', 'imagined', 'whole', 'thing', 'then', 'end', 'when', 'doctor', 'poor', 'guy', 'fought', 'good', 'fight', 'Then', 'see', 'son', 'there', 'take', 'up', 'heaven.At', 'End', 'Film', 'caption', 'was', 'reported', 'drug', 'BZ', 'was', 'used', 'troops', 'Vietnam']",N/A

Was it all a flashback - or a flash forward? What was real, and what was only in the hero's mind? Are even the apparently ""real"" sequences the product of his imagination?"" Roger EbertMy best friend urged me to view 'Jacob's Ladder' after we had discussed philosophies of life and death. I remembered reading about Jacob's Ladder from the Bible 'Jacob's vision in which he saw a stairway from earth to Heaven with angels descending and ascending.' Little did I realize that this film was the reality.This film is not like anything I have ever seen. It is a viscerally frightening film that kept me on the edge of my seat.  It opens with a scene in the Mekong Delta.  Jacob Singer, as played by Tim Robbins and his squadron of  soldiers are seen joking about human existence.  Minutes later, all hell breaks loose, explosions, convulsions, and jerky hand-held camera movements. And, then we move to the subway where Jacob is reading Camus and frightening, exotic and dangerous events occur. Jacob works for the post office and this must be the anchor of his daily existence. Taking stock of Jacob's existence it seems. I sat right on the edge of my seat while viewing this film and feel this is an analogy for the film- right on the edge, between madness and sanity. Elizabeth Pena plays Jacob's girlfriend and is she the piece that holds sanity together? The film is really about coming to peace with one's life or death. What really happens during those last few moments of life?  Once in your head, Jacob's Ladder is there for good.Louis, Jacob's friend and doctor says it best: "" Eckhart saw Hell too. He said: The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won't let go of life, your memories, your attachments. They burn them all away. But they're not punishing you, he said. They're freeing your soul. So, if you're frightened of dying and... and you're holding on, you'll see devils tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace, then the devils are really angels, freeing you from the earth.""Devils or Angels, which is it?

While my Jacob's Ladder isn't the Region 1 Special Edition with the deleted scenes included, it still contains the original theatrical trailer of nearly 2 minutes, with flashes of the deleted scenes. Better than nothing, right?  :-)To put it simply, this film is unique because it's not simply a horror. It's a romance, drama, thriller, horror, all rolled into one film. It's also a damning critique of the Vietnam War and the psychological consequences faced by veterans years after their ordeals. The music and the atmosphere are also perfect. For example, when Singer (Robbins) is on a gurney and being wheeled through the hospital aka ""Hell"", the music is so morbid that it makes the hairs on your neck stand up. Not to mention the eerie hospital patients, disfigured creatures and limbs and blood on the floor.The acting is first rate, no doubt about it, especially from Robbins, in my opinion. For a film that is 15 years old, the special effects are absolutely breathtaking! Even horror films of today don't have the kind of effect that this film had on me. It was well ahead of it's time and can easily compete with today's so-called ""horror"" films. A couple of scenes really made me jump and my heart beat really fast. Hardly ever can I say that about a horror film.However, even when the scenes were not so much scary as they were disturbing and grotesque, your heart still starts to race and there is a huge feeling of anxiety and anticipation. I'm so glad that I've added this film to my collection and I'm astonished that it's such an underrated film.I can understand why some scenes were deleted and why certain types of audiences complained that the film was too dark and macabre. Make no mistake: it's a film which is not for the faint-hearted and even if you have a pretty strong stomach (like me), you'll be very surprised at the effect it has on you.The only criticism?

74660,A361LE16VBQDP8,0784011168,Robert Bezimienny,"[7, 19]","Having finished a viewing of this film, my friend turned to me and said, ""There was a good film in there somewhere, but that wasn't it."".  One element which severely detracts from the film as it stands is the lack of depth to Tim Robbins' character, Jacob Singer.  Beyond a little biography, we learn almost nothing about him in the two hour stretch - of course things happen to him, but he is the passive victim of events, much like the cardboard protagonists of slasher films; if, after ten minutes of the film and then again at the end of it, a viewer were asked to predict what Jacob would do in the face of a moral dilemma, or a personal tragedy, then the answer would likely be the same (and just as uncertain) in both cases.  No other character fares any better - they all remain static.*Interest, then, is shouldered by the plot.  As often remarked, the film-makers try to make things confusing.  But they also feel obliged to tell you some things unambiguously.  Most egregious is the appearance of Mr.Newman, who identifies himself as a chemist, conscripted by the US government to run experiments on the soldiers - in a five minute scene he explains the movie to both Jacob and the audience, confirming everyone's suspicions.  Armed with this explanation, the movie is then a ride through Jacob's deranged mind, and if some things remain ambiguously poised between being his hallucinations and being reality, then this is less interesting than it might be, for often it makes no difference to our understanding or experience of the film whether things prove to be real or not.*Likewise the twist ending is quite impotent.  If it is meant to raise the possibility that the entire film represents the dying thoughts of a soldier that never returned from Vietnam, then one can legitimately ask if such thoughts would plausibly occur to a man in such a situation - dying, far from home, would one concoct a tale of govenment conspiracy and mind-altering drugs for one's last reflections on life?  You dream about leaving your wife and children and shacking up with a girl from the mailroom? No thoughts of friends or parents, school or university years? The twist is plain stupid, and it's gratuitous because it does not force one to see the film in a new and insightful light - in contrast to other films that use the same device, such as Brazil and The Sixth Sense, and other stories for that matter (for an old obscure one, try ""Baron Bagge"", by Alexander Lernet-Holenia (I'm not kidding, that is his name)).*As far as the craft of film-making goes, the film is just passable.  Adrian Lyne's heritage in advertising is evident, with the cinematography echoing the style of 'sophisticated' liquor and lingerie ads of the late eighties.  Music videos are another influence.  It's eye candy of the Ridley Scott variety, and it's fine as far as it goes.  The acting is as good as the directing and script allows.  Tim Robbins embodies the spirit of being caught in a waking nightmare.*How to improve such a film?  A suggestion might be to show Jacob in his pre-war days relating to his family, perhaps in a flawed way, tempted by adultery or greed, and with other influences bearing upon him, say from parental or societal expectations, and only then, with some definition of his character, cast him into the horror of Vietnam - once there, the film-makers could raise the possibility of exposure to hallucinogens, and make it ambiguous whether it was the war experience itself, or a chemical, which damaged and deranged his subsequent life.  The Vietnam, and post-Vietnam, experiences then become 'a waking nightmare' - there might even be a chance to fashion a redemptive ending, or alternatively a truly unredemptive tragedy, depending on one's intention.  Yes, and all this would start to resemble, albeit in a potentially more surreal way, Born on the Fourth of July.  Well, that might not be a bad thing, since for all its weaknesses that film was far more satisfying than Jacob's Ladder which, for me, remains a bit of a mess.",2,"Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're...Arrghh, watch out!",1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,4039,"['Having', 'finished', 'viewing', 'film', 'friend', 'turned', 'said', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'somewhere', 'was', ""n't"", 'it.', 'One', 'element', 'severely', 'film', 'lack', 'depth', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'character', 'Jacob', 'Singer', 'Beyond', 'little', 'biography', 'learn', 'almost', 'nothing', 'two', 'hour', 'stretch', 'course', 'things', 'happen', 'passive', 'victim', 'events', 'much', 'cardboard', 'protagonists', 'slasher', 'films', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'then', 'again', 'end', 'viewer', 'were', 'asked', 'predict', 'what', 'Jacob', 'would', 'do', 'face', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'then', 'answer', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'same', 'just', 'uncertain', 'cases', 'other', 'character', 'better', 'remain', 'static', '*Interest', 'then', 'shouldered', 'plot', 'often', 'remarked', 'film-makers', 'try', 'make', 'things', 'confusing', 'also', 'feel', 'obliged', 'tell', 'things', 'unambiguously', 'Most', 'egregious', 'appearance', 'Mr.Newman', 'who', 'chemist', 'conscripted', 'US', 'government', 'run', 'experiments', 'soldiers', 'five', 'minute', 'scene', 'movie', 'Jacob', 'audience', 'confirming', 'everyone', 'suspicions', 'Armed', 'explanation', 'movie', 'then', 'ride', 'Jacob', 'deranged', 'mind', 'things', 'remain', 'ambiguously', 'poised', 'being', 'hallucinations', 'being', 'reality', 'then', 'less', 'interesting', 'might', 'be', 'often', 'difference', 'understanding', 'experience', 'film', 'things', 'prove', 'be', 'real', 'not', '*Likewise', 'twist', 'ending', 'quite', 'impotent', 'meant', 'raise', 'possibility', 'entire', 'film', 'dying', 'thoughts', 'soldier', 'never', 'returned', 'Vietnam', 'then', 'one', 'can', 'legitimately', 'ask', 'such', 'thoughts', 'would', 'plausibly', 'occur', 'man', 'such', 'situation', 'dying', 'far', 'home', 'would', 'one', 'concoct', 'tale', 'govenment', 'conspiracy', 'mind-altering', 'drugs', 'one', 'last', 'reflections', 'life', 'dream', 'leaving', 'wife', 'children', 'shacking', 'up', 'girl', 'mailroom', 'thoughts', 'friends', 'parents', 'school', 'university', 'years', 'twist', 'plain', 'stupid', 'gratuitous', 'not', 'force', 'one', 'see', 'film', 'new', 'insightful', 'light', 'contrast', 'other', 'films', 'use', 'same', 'device', 'such', 'Brazil', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'other', 'stories', 'matter', 'old', 'obscure', 'one', 'try', 'Baron', 'Bagge', 'Alexander', 'Lernet-Holenia', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'name', '*As', 'far', 'craft', 'film-making', 'film', 'just', 'passable', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'heritage', 'advertising', 'evident', 'cinematography', 'echoing', 'style', ""'sophisticated"", 'liquor', 'lingerie', 'ads', 'late', 'eighties', 'Music', 'videos', 'are', 'influence', 'eye', 'candy', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'variety', 'fine', 'as', 'far', 'acting', 'as', 'good', 'directing', 'script', 'allows', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'spirit', 'being', 'caught', 'waking', 'nightmare', '*How', 'improve', 'film', 'suggestion', 'might', 'be', 'show', 'Jacob', 'pre-war', 'days', 'relating', 'family', 'perhaps', 'flawed', 'way', 'tempted', 'adultery', 'greed', 'other', 'influences', 'bearing', 'say', 'parental', 'societal', 'expectations', 'only', 'then', 'definition', 'character', 'cast', 'horror', 'Vietnam', 'once', 'there', 'film-makers', 'could', 'raise', 'possibility', 'exposure', 'hallucinogens', 'make', 'ambiguous', 'was', 'war', 'experience', 'chemical', 'damaged', 'deranged', 'subsequent', 'life', 'Vietnam', 'post-Vietnam', 'experiences', 'then', 'become', 'waking', 'nightmare', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'chance', 'fashion', 'redemptive', 'ending', 'alternatively', 'truly', 'unredemptive', 'tragedy', 'depending', 'one', 'intention', 'Yes', 'would', 'start', 'resemble', 'albeit', 'potentially', 'more', 'surreal', 'way', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'Well', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'thing', 'weaknesses', 'film', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'satisfying', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'bit', 'mess']",N/A

This is a monster movie of the mind. You can read other reviewers comments for the plot; I won't waste Amazon's real estate on repeating that. What needs to be reiterated is that this movie captures that nightmare world between consciousness and unconsciousness: that troubled sleep, as Sartre put it.The direction and editing are nearly flawless. And, across the board, the performances are electric. I have no idea what Rochell O'Gorman means by saying Tim Robbins' performance was &quot;lethargic&quot;. His moments of fear, confusion, and sorrow are consistently convincing. And his few minutes of relief at the hands of his chiropractor (Danny Aiello in an unusually sweet turn, for him) also offer the viewer a break from the relentlessly frightening images. However, when those few moments pass, the horror that follows is made even more terrifying.

He quotes German mystic Meister Eckhart and tells Jacob: ""If you're frightened of dying and you're holding on, you'll see demons tearing your life away. If you've made your peace, then the demons are really angels, freeing you from the earth.""And even the title of the movie has an interesting history.

Lately he has been having terrible dreams and flashbacks that are starting to spill over into his waking hours. They are gradually taking over his life and threaten to destroy his sanity. As the nightmares get worse, Jacob's grip on reality gets weaker.My Opinion:  This is a tough movie. A lot of people have a hard time with it. It's not a straight forward story that is easily understood. It takes some work to get into and a lot of people won't want to work for their entertainment. I will try to explain why I like it without spoiling the entire plot. The IMDB says that Jacob's Ladder is also known as Dante's Inferno. This should hint at the fact that there is something deeper than a just a horror movie going on here. Keep in mind that the viewer has a lot to do with interpreting a movie and attributing meanings to it. If  things are missed, invented, or misinterpreted, then different people can have far different feelings about a movie because they haven't really seen the same movie. Such is the case with Jacob's Ladder. Some people have complained that the ending negates the entire film. This isn't so. It is the entire film. It is a complete story from beginning to end. It just isn't the story that we thought it was. The ending may be a surprise, but it's not a surprise ending. It is the ending that the entire story worked toward. The drugs that may or may not have been given to the soldiers are not the point. They are something that Jacob grasped at to explain his nightmares and the viewer ends up doing the same thing. But we unlike Jacob are unable to let that explanation go. To me, this is an extreme example of every movie. It shows how different people can see the same thing and all come away with something completely different. That's one of the main things I love about movies. It also shows that there are smart people out there making movies for the smart people watching them. And that's nice to know because sometimes I feel a little lonely.DVD Quality:  Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1 DD5.1 Picture and sound were great. There are a lot of great extras on this DVD including deleted scenes with and without commentary, commentary for the feature, a making of documentary, production notes and cast and crew bios.

74669,A1WFEHAV42HTM5,0784011168,Scrimshaw,"[2, 2]","Jacob's Ladder, is quite possibly the most original horror film I have ever seen. It's definitely a mystery, but with enough dark and disturbing elements to elevate it to the level of horror, very psychological in essence. It follows a man named Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) who is living in New York City after being discharged from Vietnam with a Hispanic woman named Jezzie. He suffers from bizarre frightening hallucinations and strange flashbacks to his time in Vietnam and before, focusing on his life with his family and especially his son Gabe, who died before Jacob was deployed to Vietnam. The film itself is very confusing, especially seeing it for the first time, and don't be surprised if you don't know what the hell is going when you watch it. I know I sure didn't although by the end I had a better understanding of it, but I will definitely need to watch it again to fully understand this film, no doubt about it. Suffice it to say, I was in no way expecting it to end like it did, and I was thoroughly pleased how unpredictable it turned out to be. With all of his visions of demons and talk of hell I thought that Jacob had died in combat in Vietnam and was now living in hell and unaware of it, along with his fellow soldiers who had also died and were unaware. In the end though, I am glad that I watched this film, it was quite an experience, not to mention creepy and disturbing as hell, no pun intended. In the end though it impressed me, and I would greatly recommend this to anyone who's tired of those cliched slasher, gore, haunted house, and exorcism films that Hollywood churns out by the dozens nowadays.

74671,A3F0HT2YG3X6CD,0784011168,"Serkan Okar ""movie and music connoisseur""","[86, 96]","Jacob's Ladder is a psychological thriller in which Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins), a Vietnam veteran, is suffering from hallucinations which seem to have some connection with what happened to him one night in Vietnam war.  Jacob finds himself living in different time realities and he just cannot  grab at the present time. He sees demons and nightmarish visions strangely  combined with flashbacks of that night in Vietnam which make him pass out.  When he regains conciousness, he wakes up to completely a different time  reality which, too, turns out to be a false at the end, leading him to  another false reality. He cannot make sense of the situation and thinks he  is losing his mind. He constantly finds himself trapped in neverending  sequences of nightmares that he cannot wake up from. This cycle never ends  until the end of the film when all the other realities vanish, leaving out  only one reality which makes Jacob's Ladder a brilliant movie. Jacob's  physician Louis probably express the main theme of the movie best in these  words: ""So, if you're frightened of dying and... and you're holding on,  you'll see devils tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace,  then the devils are really angels, freeing you from the earth.""I think  this movie is unfairly underestimated and not given enough credit. Tim  Robbins' performance is flawless and fascinating. Adrian Lyne directed the  movie very well; the emotions and the tension that are aimed to be brought  about are achieved quite successfully. One interesting fact about the movie  is that when you watch it for the second time, you notice a lot of things,  which you did not notice or could not make sense out of in the first place.  Names, small incidents, conversations, even the advertisement in the  downtown train take on a new meaning once you know what is really happening  to Jacob Singer. I strongly recommend Jacob's Ladder to the people who like psychological thrillers and soft horror movies.Bluray review: I must say I am disappointed by the bluray release of Jacob's Ladder.

Questions that do not necessarily lend themselves to easy answers. But the movie offers its own interpretations (in a somewhat watered down ending) while still allowing for the audience to draw its own conclusions.Everything is right in this movie. The direction, acting and dialogue are intriguing. The plot is intricate but unfolds logically at a decent pace. The photography is atmospheric and and the special effects are understated yet effective. The character of the protagonist is developed immaculately, his anguish is almost palpable.Unless you're super-squeamish, this is a fascinating movie.

Too often the wellfair of our soliders is kicked aside in favor for these inhumane tests. The effects of Agent Orange on these soliders for example, were never analyzed and thousands of vets now suffer for the lack of research. Even today, soligers are forced to take experimental drugs like the AVA anthrax vaccine. failure to do so results in cort marshal. Many experience rapid health failure soon after. Vets are never the same after what they see in warfair. Poor health, shell shock, and flashbacks to name just some of the  symptoms . Jacob's ladder shows the devastating effects that war has on these men's mental health.

At any time, his mundane life may be fractured by bizarre, frightening apparitions that are becoming increasingly menacing. All of the people who are important to him - his lover, his ex-wife, his kids, his V.A. psychiatrist, his old army pals, seem to be shifting and transforming, becoming part of the nightmare and leaving him with no secure port in the tortured storm that his life has become. As he seeks to avoid madness, he searches for answers in his past, trying to unravel the truth behind a mysterious and terrible event that happened to him and his unit in Viet Nam.`Jacob's Ladder' is a deeply disturbing and thought provoking film that effectively pulls the audience into the terror that Singer is experiencing. By shredding linear plot, it leaves the audience as confused and unmoored as the protagonist is, allowing them to fully empathize with his plight. Its demonic apparitions are truly chilling, like something that may have come from the depths of your own nightmares. A scene where Singer is transported on a gurney into the bowls of an increasingly bizarre and hellish hospital ranks as one of the most frightening in all of cinematic history. It is adult, psychological horror at its best.Tim Robbins gives an effective performance as the protagonist. His Jacob Singer is an ordinary every man, who is slowly slipping into utter confusion and fear of madness and death.  Elizabeth Pena is outstanding as his lover, in a role by turns playful and menacing, but always incredibly sexy. Danny Aiello gives the best performances of his career as Singer's chiropractor/mentor/confidant - the only person in his crumbling life who offers him hope of salvation from the hell he is descending into.`Jacob's Ladder' is the only film that has ever truly frightened me as an adult. In addition to being terrifying, it is intelligent and thought provoking. I first saw this film when it was in the theaters fifteen years ago, and have watched it many times since, and it has never lost its edge for me.

74691,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,0784011168,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[4, 6]","Director:  Adrian LyneCast:  Tim Robbins, Elizabeth Pena, Danny Aiello, Matt Craven, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Jason Alexander, Patricia Kalember, Macaulay Culkin.Running Time:  115 minutesRated R for violence, language, nudity, and a sex scene involving the Devil!The film begins with Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) and his platoon in Vietnam. When they're suddenly attacked, chaos ensues, and the platoon appears to be the victims of some kind of chemical warfare. Jacob is stabbed in the stomach with a bayonet. Suddenly, without explanation, we see Jacob back in New York City. He's returned home from the war and he's trying to get his life back on track, but he keeps having odd experiences, seeing odd, frightening people, and having close calls with death. He cannot tell ""dreams"" from reality. What happened to him in Vietnam?  ""Jacob's Ladder"" is the grandfather of the ""rubber reality"" films that became so popular throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s. The films with the most direct influence from ""Jacob's Ladder"" have appeared more recently--""Memento"" (2000), ""Mulholland Drive"" (2001), ""The I Inside"" (2003), and The Butterfly Effect (2004).  Of course, like any artwork, ""Jacob's Ladder"" has its precursors, too, such as the short story by Ambrose Bierce called ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"", which was originally published in 1891 and later used as a basis of a silent film called The Spy (1929), and then a French short entitled ""La Riviere du hibou"" (literally ""The River of the Owl""), the latter also airing as an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" (1959). There is a very strong religious/mythical allegory running throughout the film--seen in everything from the Judeo/Christian nature of the character's names and the title of the film itself to character interests, as Jacob begins extensively studying demonology, the occult and so forth in an attempt to figure out what is happening to him. We are also treated to subtle connections with other works, such as philosopher Albert Camus' novel L'Etranger (""The Stranger""), which Jacob is reading in the film when we first see him on the subway, and there are many at least subtle stylistic and content precursors, such as ""Altered States"" (1980).In light of the subsequent instantiations of the film's brand of rubberizing reality, as well as the more purely stylistic elements that have been used to often excellent effect in later films, ""Jacob's Ladder"" may seem relatively transparent or even tame. Still, ""Jacob's Ladder"" is one of the better films of its kind. Director Adrian Lyne achieved a continually offsetting creepiness that is rarely matched, and some scenes--such as the gurney journey through the increasingly dilapidated hospital corridors, could not possibly be topped.  Seen in the context of Lyne's other films, ""Jacob's Ladder"" is all the more surprising, as the bulk of his career has been focused on hyper sensual and sexy dramas and thrillers--such as ""9 1/2 Weeks"" (1986), ""Fatal Attraction"" (1987), ""Indecent Proposal"" (1993), and ""Unfaithful"" (2002). ""Jacob's Ladder"" has its share of eroticism, however, mostly through the gorgeous and impassioned Jezebel (Elizabeth Pena), even though her most heated moment has her appropriately fraternizing with a demon.  Lyne's relatively straightforward approach to the film's elastic ontology, especially in conjunction with his tendency to be forthcoming and thorough in explaining his view of the plot (a predilection shared by scriptwriter Bruce Joel Rubin) may be unfortunate in that there is an interpretation of ""Jacob's Ladder"" accepted by a vast majority as the ""right answer"". That's a shame because there are countless possible readings of this material; differing views on everything from the general crux to the smallest minutiae. Part of the inherent beauty of the film is that any scene or set of scenes may equally be taken as the ""real events"", and any of the dialogue may be taken as providing clues to your preferred interpretation. Robbins' performance is important to the film in that he is the focal point of almost every scene and has to convincingly play a vast range of emotions; he does so with finesse. The rest of the cast is noteworthy, even though their questionable nature gives them a lot of leeway in terms of verisimilitude and consistency.But the real driving force that makes ""Jacob's Ladder"" such a success is its eeriness. This is a horror film after all, both on psychological and more apparent supernatural levels. Lyne continually and disconcertingly pulls the rug from beneath not only Jacob, but the audience as well, yet manages to never make a viewer feel lost, instead producing an eagerness to solve the ""mystery"" while you root for Jacob.  ""Jacobs Ladder"" requires the viewer to do the thinking, letting them have their own perceptions of the film rather then being fed that of the directors. If you do choose to go on Jacobs journey with him be warned, it wont always be pretty, but you will come out of it gratified that for once in film you have the freedom to think for yourself.",5,Jacob's Ladder  (1990),1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,5067,"['Director', 'Adrian', 'LyneCast', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Elizabeth', 'Pena', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'Matt', 'Craven', 'Pruitt',

74697,A3T689SS856U3N,0784011168,Vincent Lassauw,"[1, 1]","Very impressive movie by Adrian Lyne, who apparently was involved on a very personal level, as unfortunately his other work isn't exactly world shattering, but this one makes up for it all. Although it wasn't exactly a maverick move in 1990 to make a Vietnam film, this is certainly one of the most interesting ones on the subject. This is maybe a bold statement in view of the company this movie is in concerning this subject matter, but I do think it not to be an exaggeration.What makes this movie so special? It sheds light on America's involvement in the war from an angle that is not often seen: the use of its own soldiers for experiments in chemical warfare on the one hand (macro story) and the thoughts, feelings, memories, dreams of the future of a veteran (micro story) on the other hand, which is a dramatically very effective combination, that really pulls the viewer in, especially if the main protagonist is performed so magnificently as is being done here by a very young Tim Robbins.What makes the movie even more special is the structure, that gives shape to the story, causing the viewer in, what we would now call ""Donnie Darko"", fashion to be hurled through space, time and seemingly parallel realities, dipped in a horror genre type nightmarish atmosphere, which is pretty disturbing. As in Donnie Darko the viewer is repeatedly misdirected and so I've seen on many occasions that various viewers were equally moved as well as confused while looking at the credits rolling by, all the while enjoying the beautiful soundtrack which the movie can boast as well.One can think of at least three different interpretations concerning the title of the movie, the first one being an obvious reference to the main protagonist's name Jacob Singer, the other two requiring some bible knowledge and patience until watching a major plot change halfway through the movie, that I can't expand upon without giving away crucial plot points. But anyway, who is this mister Singer, apart from the fact that he in view of what I stated earlier obviously is in Vietnam? In the opening scene we see him deployed there with his comrades in arms, having a, what seems to be a relaxed, break before what Sarah Palin would call a ""surge"". a kind of chilling on the battlefield I suppose. Suddenly explosions all around and the sound of helicopter flyby's, either panicking the soldiers or making them sick and throw up. Jacob runs but soon is on the receiving end of a bayonet. End of movie ... nah, next thing we see him wake up in a subway car, ah, so it was all a dream of that period and the war turns out to have ended a number of years ago. After his return from Vietnam Jacob gave up on college as, so he explains, ""... didn't want to think anymore after the war"", and drives a mail van. Still a bit in a daze over his dream he looks around in the car and notices his fellow passengers, a homeless person sleeping it off and a woman who keeps staring at him with a penetrating look who he asks whether ""Bergen Street"" stop has come and gone or not. The woman just looks at him strangely and no answer is forthcoming. As luck would have it the next stop turns out to be just the one he needed. As he's getting out and passes the homeless person, in a flash Singer sees a kind of wormlike creature quickly pulling back inside the man's coat. Quite disturbed by this he gets off the subway.Next unpleasant surprise is the fact that the exit of the station is locked off and he will have to cross the track to try and get out on the other side. As he's walking across a new train is approaching but as it is unclear which track it's going to switch to, Singer is in a tough spot. At the last possible instant he leaps and the subway car passes him at a hair's breadth. As the train flashes by, in the cars we see a radiant white light and vague human shapes standing at the windows all looking out with at its end an unrecognizable figure which stares at Singer as the train disappears into the dark.The atmosphere in this very strong opening is typical for the rest of the movie and we see how Jacob's life spirals down in an increasingly threatening and frightening way, with intermediate flashbacks to Vietnam as we see what happened to Jacob after the bayonet encounter. He loses his grip on reality more and more and has increasing difficulty in separating the real from imagination, past and present. A phone call from fellow veteran friend who desperately wants to see him and in the subsequent meeting turns out to suffer from the same type of experiences Singer is having. This starts off a series of discoveries into a dark affair, connected to their time in Vietnam.There's a number of fascinating characters in this movie, first and foremost Jacob's chiropractor Louis, magnificently performed by Danny Aiello.Naturally there's a whole lot more to this movie but that I wish for the viewer to discover. I've seen this movie many times with different people and each time it strikes me how much it moves them without fail.",5,Angels and Demons,1222992000,"10 3, 2008",2008,5033,"['Very', 'impressive', 'movie', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'who', 'apparently', 'was', 'involved', 'very', 'personal', 'level', 'unfortunately', 'other', 'work', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'world', 'shattering', 'one', 'up', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'maverick', 'move', '1990', 'make', 'Vietnam', 'film', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'ones', 'subject', 'maybe', 'bold', 'statement', 'view', 'company', 'movie', 'concerning', 'subject', 'matter', 'do', 'think', 'not', 'be', 'exaggeration.What', 'movie', 'so', 'special', 'light', 'America', 'involvement', 'war', 'angle', 'not', 'often', 'seen', 'use', 'own', 'soldiers', 'experiments', 'chemical', 'warfare', 'one', 'hand', 'macro', 'story', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'memories', 'dreams', 'future', 'veteran', 'micro', 'story', 'other', 'hand', 'dramatically', 'very', 'effective', 'combination', 'really', 'viewer', 'especially', 'main', 'protagonist', 'performed', 'so', 'magnificently', 'being', 'done', 'here', 'very', 'young', 'Tim', 'Robbins.What', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'special', 'structure', 'shape', 'story', 'causing', 'viewer', 'what', 'would', 'now', 'call', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'fashion', 'be', 'hurled', 'space', 'time', 'seemingly', 'parallel', 'realities', 'dipped', 'horror', 'genre', 'type', 'nightmarish', 'atmosphere', 'pretty', 'disturbing', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'viewer', 'repeatedly', 'misdirected', 'so', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'occasions', 'various', 'viewers', 'were', 'equally', 'moved', 'as', 'well', 'confused', 'looking', 'credits', 'rolling', 'while', 'enjoying', 'beautiful', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'can', 'boast', 'well.One', 'can', 'think', 'least', 'three', 'different', 'interpretations', 'concerning', 'title', 'movie', 'first', 'one', 'being', 'obvious', 'reference', 'main', 'protagonist', 'name', 'Jacob', 'Singer', 'other', 'two', 'requiring', 'bible', 'knowledge', 'patience', 'watching', 'major', 'plot', 'change', 'halfway', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expand', 'giving', 'away', 'crucial', 'plot', 'points', 'anyway', 'who', 'mister', 'Singer', 'apart', 'fact', 'view', 'what', 'stated', 'earlier', 'obviously', 'Vietnam', 'opening', 'scene', 'see', 'deployed', 'comrades', 'arms', 'having', 'what', 'be', 'relaxed', 'break', 'what', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'would', 'call', 'surge', 'kind', 'chilling', 'battlefield', 'suppose', 'Suddenly', 'explosions', 'around', 'sound', 'helicopter', 'flyby', 'panicking', 'soldiers', 'making', 'sick', 'throw', 'up', 'Jacob', 'soon', 'receiving', 'end', 'bayonet', 'End', 'movie', 'nah', 'next', 'thing', 'see', 'wake', 'up', 'subway', 'car', 'ah', 'was', 'dream', 'period', 'war', 'out', 'have', 'ended', 'number', 'years', 'ago', 'return', 'Vietnam', 'Jacob', 'gave', 'up', 'college', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'think', 'anymore', 'war', 'mail', 'van', 'Still', 'bit', 'daze', 'dream', 'car', 'fellow', 'passengers', 'homeless', 'person', 'sleeping', 'off', 'woman', 'who', 'staring', 'penetrating', 'look', 'who', 'Bergen', 'Street', 'stop', 'come', 'gone', 'not', 'woman', 'just', 'strangely', 'answer', 'forthcoming', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'next', 'stop', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'one', 'needed', 'getting', 'out', 'homeless', 'person', 'flash', 'Singer', 'kind', 'wormlike', 'creature', 'quickly', 'pulling', 'back', 'man', 'coat', 'Quite', 'disturbed', 'subway.Next', 'unpleasant', 'surprise', 'fact', 'exit', 'station', 'locked', 'off', 'will', 'have', 'cross', 'track', 'try', 'get', 'out', 'other', 'side', 'walking', 'new', 'train', 'approaching', 'unclear', 'track', 'going', 'switch', 'Singer', 'tough', 'spot', 'last', 'possible', 'instant', 'subway', 'car', 'hair', 'breadth', 'train', 'flashes', 'cars', 'see', 'radiant', 'white', 'light', 'vague', 'human', 'standing', 'windows', 'looking', 'out', 'end', 'unrecognizable', 'figure', 'Singer', 'train', 'dark.The', 'atmosphere', 'very', 'strong', 'opening', 'typical', 'rest', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'Jacob', 'life', 'spirals', 'down', 'increasingly', 'threatening', 'frightening', 'way', 'intermediate', 'flashbacks', 'Vietnam', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'Jacob', 'bayonet', 'encounter', 'grip', 'reality', 'more', 'more', 'increasing', 'difficulty', 'separating', 'real', 'imagination', 'past', 'present', 'phone', 'call', 'fellow', 'veteran', 'friend', 'who', 'desperately', 'see', 'subsequent', 'meeting', 'out', 'suffer', 'same', 'type', 'experiences', 'Singer', 'having', 'off', 'series', 'discoveries', 'dark', 'affair', 'connected', 'time', 'Vietnam.There', 'number', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'movie', 'first', 'foremost', 'Jacob', 'chiropractor', 'Louis', 'magnificently', 'performed', 'Danny', 'Aiello.Naturally', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'movie', 'wish', 'viewer', 'discover', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'many', 'times', 'different', 'people', 'time', 'how', 'much', 'fail']",N/A

It's a movie about accepting the past and letting go.Throughout the movie Jacob Singer, a Vietnam veteran, played greatly by Tim Robbins, one of my favorite actors, suffers from a series of horrifying nightmares. He sees demons everywhere: horrifying creatures with tails, horns, and faceless heads. He is nearly run over by a train and sees these faceless heads looking at him through every window and by a car. He also sees repeated visions of a night in Vietnam he has trouble remembering.The movie shifts from these nightmare visions to the real world in which he lives with his girlfriend, a post office worker, to one vision in which he still lives with his wife and son who died in an accident.As he's able to accept the truth of what happened in Vietnam and what happened to his son he, as his angelic doctor Louis tells him, is able to see the demons as angels helping him to let go of his life.It's a great movie.",5,Very Profound Movie About Accepting Your Past,1123200000,"08 5, 2005",2005,985,"['very', 'moving', 'movie', 'more', 'just', 'Vietnam', 'movie', 'accepting', 'past', 'letting', 'movie', 'Jacob', 'Singer', 'Vietnam', 'veteran', 'played', 'greatly', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'suffers', 'series', 'horrifying', 'nightmares', 'demons', 'everywhere', 'horrifying', 'creatures', 'tails', 'horns', 'faceless', 'heads', 'nearly', 'run', 'over', 'train', 'faceless', 'heads', 'looking', 'window', 'car', 'also', 'repeated', 'visions', 'night', 'Vietnam', 'trouble', 'remembering.The', 'movie', 'shifts', 'nightmare', 'visions', 'real', 'world', 'girlfriend', 'post', 'office', 'worker', 'one', 'vision', 'still', 'wife', 'son', 'who', 'died', 'accident.As', 'able', 'accept', 'truth', 'what', 'happened', 'Vietnam', 'what', 'happened', 'son', 'angelic', 'doctor', 'Louis', 'able', 'see', 'demons', 'angels', 'helping', 'let', 'go', 'life.It', 'great', 'movie']",N/A
