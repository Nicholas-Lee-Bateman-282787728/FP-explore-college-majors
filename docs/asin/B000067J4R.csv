Colbourne ""i only review crap""","[3, 3]","I have seen some horrible movies in my day i.e. Kolobos, Battlefield Earth, The 6th Day, Final Destination, Rabid Grannies and countless others. But this one probably takes the cake. Word on the street is that awards are given to anyone who can sit through this entire movie. When i first started the DVD the movie began immediatly, no menu. i thought perhaps it was a preview, or a joke. i will start off talking about the film quality, which to be called sub par would be the understatement of the year. i have seen 1970's home videos that look like lord of the rings compared to this. on to the acting and script. in the rare occasion that you can hear the script over the terrible music and insistant hiss, which was set about 50 decipels above the talking, you will wish that the hiss covered that too. The &quot;acting&quot; in this movie is similar to skits people do with the camcorders when improvising. the plot in this &quot;movie&quot; is unknown to me, seeing as i fast forwarded through most of it. i admit, i will watch a terrible movie on purpose sometimes, just for laughs, this flick was beyond laughing though. i hope you aren't foolish and buy, or even rent this movie, in fact, it wasn't worth the time i spent typing this review.",1,Shocking?

The movie is boring and unintentionally hilarious and even the background music is rap and the acting makes High Schoolers look professional compared to this mess.

Then is mean manKilled himself.When the police arrived, they onlyFound the bodies of his wife,Daughter and younger son.His mentally ill son HarryWas not ever found.Legend has it, he will returnIn 13 years to revenge his family deaths.Wow... I mean, wow: if you can't even competently compose an opening prologue, you can guess how the *rest* of the ""movie"" will be...This is especially puzzling since the aforementioned Harry seems more interested in terrorizing a bunch of random teenagers. There may actually be some connection between these teenagers and the family homicide, but it is impossible to tell from this movie. Indeed, it is impossible to figure out nearly anything in this film due to the fact that all the dialogue was recorded on a built-in mic on a hand-held camcorder. I would also guess that this film was shot in sequence, one take per scene, with no editing. I kept expecting to see a brief jump-cut of Frasier or Fresh Prince of Bel Air, or whatever the master tape had been previously used to record off of tv before being recycled into this project...The original title of this film was ""The Weekend it Lives"" though mysteriously it was changed to ""Ax'em."" I have no idea why: there is only one scene involving an axe (which gets GENTLY LOWERED onto its victim!) and otherwise the murders are committed with a machete and a telephone receiver(!)There are films out there which are ""so bad they're good"" and can be seen as unintentional comedies. Only the most jaded of such aficionados would ""like"" Ax'em. I am mildly surprised to see that Aspirin isn't listed in the ""customers who bought Ax'em also bought this..."" field, as this ""film"" is a headache waiting to happen.If you want some type of ""fear factor"" challenge to give to your friends, dare them to watch this turkey start-to-finish.

Let's try though:The video on this steamer looks like it was shot with a hand-held VHS camcorder... and a VERY cheap one at that, you know, the kind you get at a pawn shop for $3.25 and still feel cheated.  It appears that the guy edited the movie with the ""pause method"" on two VCRs, playing the ""movie"" on one VCR and recording it on the other one and pausing where he wanted edits.  The more brilliant editing the guy did, the more the picture degraded... a friend of mine and I watched the VHS version of the movie, but I am certain that the DVD also looks like a 75th generation VHS copy of a 100th generation copy of an original that was submerged in some sort of pancake syrup.The sound is barely audible throughout this masterpiece and, although this might actually be a good thing in the context of this film, the dialog in movies should usually be audible.  You would have thought that he would have really wanted his audience to hear the ""yo mama"" jokes, but Mfume isn't even competent enough to pull that off.  One little bit of dialog you could hear plainly is the director saying ""cut"" at one point... I guess he didn't hit the pause button quick enough during his 2-VCR editing job.The ""acting"" is worse than anything ever put on film... one would be hard pressed to find a worse film made by 10 year-old kids who have found their dad's video camera.Luckily, the movie was only 70 minutes or so and only about 60 minutes of that was actual ""movie"" time, as the first 10 minutes or so were pointlessly filled with some sort of lame, ghetto college talent show or something that consisted of a lot of idiots acting like idiots and saying things that couldn't really be heard because the microphone on the video camera wasn't sensitive enough to pick up their brilliant dialog.The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it ended.  I am not sure why Amazon doesn't have a negative star rating, as this movie is not even deserving of a zero rating.I am not kidding when I say that the worst of Ed Wood's movies looks like Citizen Kane compared to this pile of excrement.

703681,A38AXXL7DMVFMQ,B000067J4R,"Vicente Drago ""Shaun O'Donnell""","[6, 7]","This is easily one of the worst movies to come around on a direct to video basis in a long time.  You see when you rent a movie that is direct to video, especially horror, one must anticiate a certain level of cheesiness.  However there are certain movies that should not have been released, certain movies that no matter what reason there is it just should not be released.  This is one of them.Ax'em is about a mentally retarded killer out to avenge his family murder 13 years ago.  For whatever reason he picks a group of teens who decide to go to a cabin.  Makes little sense I know,  but most times in cheesiness factor it's forgivable.  However I swear to god that this was a high school theater project.  It was done by a camcorder!!!  The sound is horriic and half the time you can't hear what it is they are saying (which is probably a good thing).  Oh and when I mean a high School theater project I mean early 90's because for a 15 minute segmant you have one guy spouting out ""Your Momma So..."" Jokes.Overall this is easily one of the dumbest ideas to have been released.  If you would be better off making your own movie than watching this.  I mean it, DON""T WATCH THIS GARBAGE!!!",1,WHo in thie right mind released this,1045008000,"02 12, 2003",2003,1193,"['easily', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'come', 'around', 'direct', 'video', 'basis', 'long', 'time', 'see', 'when', 'rent', 'movie', 'direct', 'video', 'especially', 'horror', 'one', 'must', 'anticiate', 'certain', 'level', 'cheesiness', 'However', 'are', 'certain', 'movies', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'certain', 'movies', 'matter', 'what', 'reason', 'just', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'released', 'one', ""them.Ax'em"", 'mentally', 'retarded', 'killer', 'avenge', 'family', 'murder', '13', 'years', 'ago', 'reason', 'group', 'teens', 'who', 'decide', 'go', 'cabin', 'Makes', 'little', 'sense', 'know', 'most', 'times', 'cheesiness', 'factor', 'forgivable', 'However', 'swear', 'god', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'theater', 'project', 'was', 'done', 'camcorder', 'sound', 'horriic', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'what', 'are', 'saying', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'Oh', 'when', 'mean', 'high', 'School', 'theater', 'project', 'mean', 'early', '90', 'because', '15', 'minute', 'segmant', 'have', 'one', 'guy', 'spouting', 'Momma', 'So', 'Jokes.Overall', 'easily', 'one', 'dumbest', 'ideas', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'making', 'own', 'movie', 'watching', 'mean', 'DON', 'T', 'WATCH', 'THIS', 'GARBAGE']",N/A
