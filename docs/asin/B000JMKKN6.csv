Also, Johnathan Schaech is pretty hot in the smoldering sense. It was completely romantic and chick-flicky, and I really liked it. It's all about letting go of the past and letting yourself heal to move on in life and love.The whole movie has kind of an overcast sadness, and that's what made me want to watch till the end because I was sure it had to get better. It was light and humorous in several places, though...seeing the romance bloom between Suzanne and Matt was nice and sweet. I got attached to them as a couple.I had a hard time accepting Matt's new love interest because of Matt and Suzanne's relationship, but in the last scene she redeems herself with the last line of the movie. I do think the ending was kind of rushed, but it did suit the story.Recommended for romantics everywhere. I've read reviews on here that say it's a pretty good version of the story brought to life so I'm going to read the book soon so I can compare myself.",4,Recommended for romantics or anyone who wants to cry...,1225756800,"11 4, 2008",2008,1062,"['rented', 'looked', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'romantic', 'love', 'story', 'love', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'Also', 'Johnathan', 'Schaech', 'pretty', 'hot', 'smoldering', 'sense', 'was', 'completely', 'romantic', 'chick-flicky', 'really', 'liked', 'letting', 'go', 'past', 'letting', 'heal', 'move', 'life', 'love.The', 'whole', 'movie', 'kind', 'overcast', 'sadness', 'what', 'made', 'want', 'watch', 'till', 'end', 'was', 'sure', 'had', 'get', 'better', 'was', 'light', 'humorous', 'several', 'places', 'seeing', 'romance', 'bloom', 'Suzanne', 'Matt', 'was', 'nice', 'sweet', 'got', 'attached', 'couple.I', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'accepting', 'Matt', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'Matt', 'Suzanne', 'relationship', 'last', 'scene', 'last', 'line', 'movie', 'do', 'think', 'ending', 'was', 'kind', 'rushed', 'did', 'suit', 'story.Recommended', 'romantics', 'everywhere', ""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', 'here', 'say', 'pretty', 'good', 'version', 'story', 'brought', 'life', 'so', ""'m"", 'going', 'read', 'book', 'soon', 'so', 'can', 'compare']",James Patterson's Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas

1029046,AA0JDLX3KBKDZ,B000JMKKN6,Keith,"[3, 9]",I read Patterson's book based off this story. The book was great and well worth my time reading it. It is a very short book but I grew so fond of the charactors in the book I forgot for a mintue that they were not real.The movie could not have sucked more. I did not like any of the charactors. They did not follow the book very much. They did not build the charactors up like the book. It was a complete waste of my time.The ending was sad like the book but not as touching as the book. The build up sucked and I really had a hard time with the love part of it. The actors seemed to hate each other and there was no chemistry whatso ever between them.I could not have hated this movie any more than I did.,1,Not worth your time!,1193011200,"10 22, 2007",2007,706,"['read', 'Patterson', 'book', 'based', 'off', 'story', 'book', 'was', 'great', 'well', 'time', 'reading', 'very', 'short', 'book', 'grew', 'so', 'fond', 'charactors', 'book', 'forgot', 'mintue', 'were', 'not', 'real.The', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'sucked', 'more', 'did', 'not', 'charactors', 'did', 'not', 'follow', 'book', 'very', 'much', 'did', 'not', 'build', 'charactors', 'book', 'was', 'complete', 'waste', 'time.The', 'ending', 'was', 'sad', 'book', 'not', 'as', 'touching', 'book', 'build', 'up', 'sucked', 'really', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'love', 'part', 'actors', 'seemed', 'hate', 'other', 'was', 'chemistry', 'whatso', 'ever', 'them.I', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'hated', 'movie', 'more', 'did']",James Patterson's Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas
1029047,AD10RWNINTPV0,B000JMKKN6,"Mark Murray ""Boomer-Creak""","[4, 8]","This film is a based on the novel, written by James Patterson of the same name.  It's clearly from beginning to end dominated by then Christina Applegate's husband Jonathan Schaech (plays Matt Harrison) and Kathleen Ross Perkins (Kate Wilkinson), with Christina Applegate (Suzanne Bedford, Matt's original wife) completing the ensemble.  Primarily placed in contemporary Marth's Vinyard, and having reasonable production values, Suzanne (new town doctor) and Matt (town handyman, house-painter and self-effacing unpublished writer) basically have a peanut butter and jelly style romance, lights-out sex (!#$%$@!), get married and have a baby in that order.  Jumping ahead a few years, Matt, who is completely depressed, somehow finds the initiative and has the incredible luck to make it big with a New York publishing house.  He then is quickly lassoed by his desperately lonely editor, Kate, who falls in love with him at their first luncheon---even before they're served water, I think.  But don't worry, this technically doesn't create a classic love-triangle.  Whew! This does get complex.  So forget about the plot...Fundamentally, it's a constant swing between the present and the past, with about twenty, best-fit-possible, flash-backs.  Plus, Kathleen Ross Perkins provides a stunning anchor performance.  I think Jonathan did his best to play a manic-depressive but he was probably just too confused as to whether he was playing the ""then-now-past"", ""recent-forgotten-past"", ""historical-past"", ""recent-future"", ""present-time-now-timeline"", ""future-future-present"", or what....which would be confusing for anyone!",3,Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas,1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,1622,"['film', 'based', 'novel', 'written', 'James', 'Patterson', 'same', 'name', 'clearly', 'beginning', 'end', 'dominated', 'then', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'husband', 'Jonathan', 'Schaech', 'Matt', 'Harrison', 'Kathleen', 'Ross', 'Perkins', 'Kate', 'Wilkinson', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'Suzanne', 'Bedford', 'Matt', 'original', 'wife', 'completing', 'ensemble', 'Primarily', 'placed', 'contemporary', 'Marth', 'Vinyard', 'having', 'reasonable', 'production', 'values', 'Suzanne', 'new', 'town', 'doctor', 'Matt', 'town', 'handyman', 'house-painter', 'self-effacing', 'unpublished', 'writer', 'basically', 'have', 'peanut', 'butter', 'jelly', 'style', 'romance', 'lights-out', 'sex', '%', '@', 'get', 'married', 'have', 'baby', 'order', 'Jumping', 'ahead', 'few', 'years', 'Matt', 'who', 'completely', 'depressed', 'somehow', 'initiative', 'incredible', 'luck', 'make', 'big', 'New', 'York', 'publishing', 'house', 'then', 'quickly', 'lassoed', 'desperately', 'lonely', 'editor', 'Kate', 'who', 'love', 'first', 'luncheon', '-even', ""'re"", 'served', 'water', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'technically', ""n't"", 'create', 'classic', 'love-triangle', 'Whew', 'get', 'complex', 'So', 'forget', 'plot', 'Fundamentally', 'constant', 'swing', 'present', 'past', 'twenty', 'best-fit-possible', 'flash-backs', 'Kathleen', 'Ross', 'Perkins', 'stunning', 'anchor', 'performance', 'think', 'Jonathan', 'did', 'best', 'play', 'manic-depressive', 'was', 'probably', 'just', 'too', 'confused', 'was', 'playing', 'then-now-past', 'recent-forgotten-past', 'historical-past', 'recent-future', 'present-time-now-timeline', 'future-future-present', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'confusing', 'anyone']",James Patterson's Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas
