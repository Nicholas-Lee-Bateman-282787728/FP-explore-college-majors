1335409,ADYY6PI1PLEFC,B003BCFQQC,"Alan K. Sumrall ""Al Sumrall""","[0, 0]","There have been a few films of the French and Indian war but this one is the best.  Spencer Tracy leads a good cast (not a great cast-a lot of the casting was apparently done in trying to get as accurate a depiction of troops of the era--no musclemen or fat reenactors in this film which required a lot of physical exertion) in a film where the director sought realize the grittiness realism of the era and succeeded. Walter Brennan is as close to comic relief as there is and even this is subdued. Although the actual battle may not be quite as historically accurate as it is depicted (their is considerable disagreement as to the quality and number of the opposition), the director went to great efforts to realistically portray the fighting although the propaganda value of the battle at St. Francis was probably equal to what is seen in the film, this event great helped the morale of the folks living in the region as well as discouraged the enemy over the long run. However the march to St. Francis and the desperate costly trek back is very informative and takes all glory from war and battle.

The Rangers are, at that time a British Army unit (and there was more than just one of them), and it is from these outfits, which the US Army Rangers are descended.  The Rangers wore either a Highland bonnet, or a cap rather like a deerstalker with the brim turned up.  Buckskin leggings and knives would have been a nice addition to the costume as well, but all of the troopers are uniformly clad in a sort of forest green colour.  The calibre of the muskets in those days was about .69, so if you were hit in the gut like Ranger Towns, they would have left you where you lay.  My favorite bit in the movie is, during the assault on St. Francis, you can actually see rubber bayonets flopping around!!!! :)  That in itself makes the movie all worthwhile.  I did not care for the woodman's stew the Rangers were cooking towards the end to stave off starvation.  The hawks were hardly plucked and dumped in the boil.  One thinks more nourishment would be in order from eating the flesh.  This film may do well as a remake, if proper historical research were employed.

That is the stated goal of Robert Rogers (Spencer Tracy)as he leads his Rangers West at the end of the movie.  The basis of this movie is the action that occurred when the Rangers were commissioned by the English Army commander to raid an Indian village located adjacent to a French outpost and recover captured Whites.  As the raid must be conducted in a manner that will prevent either the French army or the Indians from becoming aware and prepared, the approach to the outpost is made over the most rugged terrain one could imagine including carrying boats over mountains and wading though mosquito invested swamps with barely enough provisions to prevent starvation. The raid takes the outpost and village by complete surprise.  However, the food they hoped to capture for sustaining them on the return trip by a different route wasn't there.  All that was available was a small amount of parched corn.Robert Young and Walter Brennan are two of the Rangers in the battle.  How they come to be Rangers is a sub-plot to the movie. Suffice to say hot buttered rum furnished by Tracy preceded their ""enlistment"".  Young plays the role of an artist who is adept at map-making and Rogers figured he needed him on this venture. Brennan just happened to be Young's friend.  During the raid Young is wounded and must find the courage and stamina to walk on the return trip.  He is encouraged by Rogers to accomplish this superhuman effort by reminding him that the Rangers do not carry wounded and that if he is left he will never see the beautiful woman (Ruth Hussey)he intends to marry ever again.The movie centers around the hardships to get home including hunger, insanity and Indian ambush that reduces their number to 1/3 of the original number that started the raid.

It is racist in its treatment of the American Indian . Something I knew it had in it's view.  But its a piece of history . Spencer Tracy leads the way in this adventure  which was filmed in Idaho .  I bought it for two reasons.  1- it was a time capsule in thinking ...and I wanted my grandchildren to see the error in that thinking.  and 2- it contains a humorous moment  between Robert Young (yes he did more than play Dr Welby on TV) and Walter Brennan.  THe phrase &#34;Rancid bear grease &#34;  has been running around my head for decades .
