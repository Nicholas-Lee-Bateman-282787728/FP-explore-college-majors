1135321,A1ENC0ALMHVBU,B00126ZR7W,"D. HupFons ""Hup234""","[0, 0]","Fans of Russian cinema will want to see this little known gem. It's an evocative film that focuses on the human impact of war on the Chechnyan populace, Russian soldiers, and primarily on a Russian Army officer (Vasily Shevtsov) and his grandmother Alexandra Nikolaevna who has traveled to a town near the front to visit him.Since the real-world conflict there has been underway for more than a decade (it started in the mid-'90s), the film seems to be set after the war has been underway for a while.  This can be inferred from the established Russian military base and the operation of an open-air market in the war-torn Chechnyan town near the base.The lack of a specific point in time during that war can be construed as a clue that the film is trying to make a broad statement about the war, and perhaps war in general.  Most of the film follows the Russian grandmother Alexandra, played by renowned Russian opera star Galina Vishnevskaya (the real-life spouse of Russian cellist & conductor Mstislav Rostropovich). She gives a splendid understated performance as she travels by train and armored personnel carrier to visit her grandson Denis and spends a few days with him at his military base, and visiting a nearby Chechnyan town.During Alexandra's brief stay at the military base, she passes her time by wandering around the camp (without her escort), chatting with the soldiers, and relishing the little time that she and her grandson Denis can share.  Of course, being the caring grandma that she is, Alexandra occasionally chides Denis for such things as not keeping himself and his uniforms cleaner!As is characteristic of a number of Russian films that I've seen, the director (Aleksandr Sokurov) sets the mood of the film early, specifically during the military train ride that Alexandra takes as she embarks on her long, tiring journey to Chechnya.Don't expect much expository dialogue in this film.  The strength of this film can be found mostly in its nonverbals -- the glances, stares, smiles, slumped shoulders, and silences.The faces of the soldiers, who apparently are replacements heading to the front, show the awkwardness and homesickness they feel.  They look at this elderly woman oddly but seldom speak to her.  They treat her politely, as they might their own grandmother, and then, at times, when they cannot help her get off a platform or squirm into the hatch of the armored personnel carrier, they enjoin her to just ""leg go"" and essentially to trust that they will not allow her to be harmed, as they might to one of their own mates.Sokurov's subtle, masterful direction and Vishnevskaya's impressively nuanced performance are shown in other scenes with the soldiers at the Russian base (including the commander of her grandson's unit), a visit to the local market, and being befriended by a Chechnyan widow from the town.The EXTRAS feature on the DVD contains the press conference held after the preview showing of the film to the Russian media.  It offers insight into the heartfelt efforts that went into the making of the film and is worth watching.  Just remember that it's a Russian press conference, so you can expect a more subdued exchange between the artists and the media.",4,For Lovers of Russian Cinema,1241049600,"04 30, 2009",2009,3217,"['Fans', 'Russian', 'cinema', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'little', 'known', 'gem', 'evocative', 'film', 'human', 'impact', 'war', 'Chechnyan', 'populace', 'Russian', 'soldiers', 'primarily', 'Russian', 'Army', 'officer', 'Vasily', 'Shevtsov', 'grandmother', 'Alexandra', 'Nikolaevna', 'who', 'traveled', 'town', 'front', 'visit', 'him.Since', 'real-world', 'conflict', 'been', 'underway', 'more', 'decade', 'started', ""mid-'90s"", 'film', 'be', 'set', 'war', 'been', 'underway', 'while', 'can', 'be', 'inferred', 'established', 'Russian', 'military', 'base', 'operation', 'open-air', 'market', 'war-torn', 'Chechnyan', 'town', 'base.The', 'lack', 'specific', 'point', 'time', 'war', 'can', 'be', 'construed', 'clue', 'film', 'trying', 'make', 'broad', 'statement', 'war', 'perhaps', 'war', 'general', 'Most', 'film', 'Russian', 'grandmother', 'Alexandra', 'played', 'renowned', 'Russian', 'opera', 'star', 'Galina', 'Vishnevskaya', 'real-life', 'spouse', 'Russian', 'cellist', 'conductor', 'Mstislav', 'Rostropovich', 'splendid', 'understated', 'performance', 'train', 'armored', 'personnel', 'carrier', 'visit', 'grandson', 'Denis', 'few', 'days', 'military', 'base', 'visiting', 'nearby', 'Chechnyan', 'town.During', 'Alexandra', 'brief', 'stay', 'military', 'base', 'time', 'wandering', 'camp', 'escort', 'chatting', 'soldiers', 'relishing', 'little', 'time', 'grandson', 'Denis', 'can', 'share', 'course', 'being', 'caring', 'grandma', 'Alexandra', 'occasionally', 'Denis', 'such', 'things', 'not', 'keeping', 'uniforms', 'cleaner', 'characteristic', 'number', 'Russian', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'director', 'Aleksandr', 'Sokurov', 'mood', 'film', 'early', 'specifically', 'military', 'train', 'ride', 'Alexandra', 'long', 'tiring', 'journey', 'Chechnya.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'expository', 'dialogue', 'film', 'strength', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'mostly', 'nonverbals', 'glances', 'stares', 'smiles', 'slumped', 'shoulders', 'silences.The', 'soldiers', 'who', 'apparently', 'are', 'replacements', 'heading', 'front', 'show', 'awkwardness', 'homesickness', 'feel', 'look', 'elderly', 'woman', 'oddly', 'seldom', 'speak', 'treat', 'politely', 'might', 'own', 'grandmother', 'then', 'times', 'when', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'get', 'off', 'platform', 'squirm', 'hatch', 'armored', 'personnel', 'carrier', 'enjoin', 'just', 'leg', 'go', 'essentially', 'trust', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'be', 'harmed', 'might', 'one', 'own', 'mates.Sokurov', 'subtle', 'masterful', 'direction', 'Vishnevskaya', 'impressively', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'are', 'shown', 'other', 'scenes', 'soldiers', 'Russian', 'base', 'including', 'commander', 'grandson', 'unit', 'visit', 'local', 'market', 'being', 'befriended', 'Chechnyan', 'widow', 'town.The', 'EXTRAS', 'feature', 'DVD', 'press', 'conference', 'held', 'preview', 'showing', 'film', 'Russian', 'media', 'insight', 'heartfelt', 'efforts', 'went', 'making', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'Just', 'remember', 'Russian', 'press', 'conference', 'can', 'expect', 'more', 'subdued', 'exchange', 'artists', 'media']",Alexandra (Aleksandra) - with ENGLISH subtitles (PAL/R5 - Russian Import)
1135322,A1VJ7HYM1EC94M,B00126ZR7W,"G P Padillo ""paolo""","[4, 4]","What an absolutely magnificent, overwhelming and ultimately satisfying film this is.Sokurov stated he had never written his own screenplay before, but felt it his duty to write a film for Vishnevskaya, partly to honor her as a great actress, but also to hopefully expiate his sins as a young man who said nothing, did nothing while people like Vishnevskaya and Rostropovich openly decried the soviet regime and their belief in democracy and human freedom generally.Few people make more beautiful looking films than Sokurov, and ""Alexandra"" is no exception, despite its location and subject matter.  Shot in the barren wastelands of war ravaged Chechnyan border, Sokurov's ever changing palette moves from brilliantly captured colors (a tree's leaves rustling in the breeze against a dusty background) to dreamlike darkness, black and white and sepia tone - the visual equivalent of a symphony or sonata.  I always forget how frustrated I become at the beginning of one of his films because his soundscapes always begin almost inaudibly, the ear straining to catch bits of dialogue that seem almost not there.  It's an effect which ultimately works drawing the viewer into the world he's creating, not unlike one's initial inability to figure out what's going on when entering a party or event.There is not much to the story:  an old woman, going to visit her long absent grandson, Denis, an army captain, at his base camp on the Chechnyan border.  After an arduous journey she arrives to the camp, a makeshift military tent village and settles in as images of her journey pass through her mind (this happens frequently throughout). She awakens to find Denis asleep and a truly touching reunion ensues, as he parades her through the camp watching the soldiers going about their mundane duties.  Denis is often gone, but the base soldiers stare at and interact with this independent, fiesty, rule-breaking old lady and we sense the soldiers' longing for home and love.  A day long journey to a Chechen village to buy cigarettes and cookies for the soldiers, finds her in a pitiful marketplace and at the point of exhaustion, where she is befriended by another old woman, the rest of the villagers fascinated by this ""foreigner.""Vishnevskaya's performance is nothing short of astonishing as is her physical appearance:  stripped of elegant costumes, hair color, and make up, her crusty, tired old Russian grandmother still radiates an undeniable beauty, and Sokurov's camera frequently lingers on it.  That face, at once world weary, angry, frightened somehow almost always registers a kind of hope that infuses the entire film.  Alexandra mumbles - constantly, even when no one's around, or her grandson has left their quarters, an almost endless monologue.  Scenes of her wandering the camp, the roads, shuffling along in her old lady shoes, complaining of her bad legs is precisely the type of thing that would bore one to tears in most films, but here, oh there is something underneath all of that.Sokurov's uses his usual casting tricks and lights his actors with a radiance that everyone - even angry young men - look beatific, with a belief that everyone really IS beautiful.  There is a bit of naivete in such thinking and that (for me) is what makes all of the films I've seen of his, seem ""more than a movie,"" but never preachy.  The actor portraying Denis really could be Alexandra's grandson as when they sit together on his cot, their faces are so similar it's uncanny.""Alexandra"" is a war movie that never shows a single fight scene but rather the ""real"" price of war and in so doing, is a powerful, sometimes heartbreaking statement.The movie is almost overloaded with moments of extreme tenderness and poignancy - which against the ravaged, brutal and stark background, makes them all the more moving.  Alexandra's new Chechen friend asks a teenage neighbor boy to accompany her on the walk back to the base and their brief conversation is one of the film's most powerful moments, when he asks ""why won't you let us be free?""  ""If only it were that simple, my boy,"" telling him the first thing we should ask God for is intelligence . . . strength does not lie in weapons or in our hands.""  The movie is filled with these little pearls that could almost be cliche, but not when uttered by this remarkable old woman.The scene of her last night with Denis almost undid me completely . . . never mind ""almost"" it did just that.  Only 90 minutes, the movie felt even shorter and I can't recall a recent film that had me smiling and near tears so many times with so seemingly ""little"" to it.  A truly remarkable achievement by a wonderful filmmaker and an 83 year old actress in her first non-singing film.  I hope others will take the time to see this.",5,One of the most beautiful movies in years.

There is military proud, desire to be recognized in that well apart place, where neither of the members of that little village appreciate them.

The great attraction for me was getting the gifts of Galina Vishnevskaya in the role of a lifetime. Her own life has been profounder than an opera role; &she's an actor of pungent means by an instinctive, interior passion rarely enough found. Her acuteness makes the camera itself but a vessel in the end. Her performance reveals a character by a kind of ecstatic stasis, detailed with subtleties impossible to catalog, and likely unforgettable. She creates with myriad near-psychic details, gestures, glances, aided by a consummately naked script, &the culminating effect lodges in mind and heart with real anguish. There's little to add to Ted Byrd's review; comments richly insightful. This is filmmaking we don't get from Hollywood; art made from suffering is the difference that defines.

That said, there are surely many fans of his art - he counts 17 films and twice as many documentaries.The story line for Alexandra is simple: Alexandra Nikolayevna (Galina Vishnevskaya) goes to visit her grandson, a captain serving in Chechnya. She stays in the military compound, roams the tents, observes life among the troops, wanders to the market, befriends a Chechen woman, and in general witnesses the alien, emotionless life of the Russian military. Exhausted and demoralized, she departs for home as her son heads off on another mop-up operation.Sokurov's laconic, realist style is well-suited to this tale, where everything seems to be brown or dusty green, where nothing much happens, though we sense that somewhere near, just beyond the range of the camera, something soon will. Alexandra wants something better, wants to live near her son, to be at peace. She will attain none of this, but she will have a brief time of tenderness with her grandson.Filmed inside Chechnya under siege-like conditions, Alexandra is a striking film. Though the overt, spoken anti-war statements come across as trite and forced, this is overshadowed by powerful visuals. And Vishnevskaya (widow of Mstislav Rostropovich) is superb as the tired Alexandra, endearing with her ceaseless mumblings, forgetfulness and deeply feeling heart.
