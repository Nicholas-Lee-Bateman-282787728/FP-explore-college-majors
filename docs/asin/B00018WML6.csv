795865,A1Z54EM24Y40LL,B00018WML6,csm,"[1, 1]","I'm not quite sure what all the fuss is about with this video. It's actually quite good and gets played over, and over, and over (you KNOW what I mean!) and is a favorite in our house. Yes, they did introduce 5 new engines - Spencer, Arthur, Emily, Salty and Harvey the crane, along with Jack, the frontloader and Murdoch. Now, as a professional marketer, I can understand why these new trains were introduced. You have to do something to expand the stories and just keeping the same old trains over and over again just isn't going to keep kids' attention very long. Plus, it's just more fun pretending with all those new characters. Personally, we like Percy and Spencer in our house the best, but really enjoy learning about all the new trains. We have quite a bit of role-playing going on here all day long and these new additions just fit right in.However, why on earth did they not go with Alec Baldwin again? The guy's an actor, for Pete's sake, the ONLY one they've had that could really tell the stories in such a marvelous way and made it very entertaining. It's what the guy does for a living and why they didn't get him for this one is beyond me. This guy, Angelis (?) is British, but for some reason, doesn't quite have the diction necessary to tell a good story. And forget about understanding Sir Topham Hatt with this dude. We had to watch it about 5 times before we could get all the dialogue for Hatt. This should have been corrected prior to production.That said, this is an excellent video. The stories are very captivating and the introduction of the new engines in the line are done very well. I do recommend it, even if the guy's voice is a little hard to understand at times.

I did not care for the new narrator, Michael Angelis, very much because he's not very creative on the voices(Alec Baldwin sure was)and some times you cant even understand what he's saying at all. The stories are okay but not as good as the other ones since they aren't the ones written by Revrend D. Awdry himself.Stories are:Gordon and Spencer 4/5:Gordon meets Spencer, the Duke and Dutchess' private engine. He thinks that he's the fastest engine in the world and refuses to take Gordon's advice about taking on plenty of water. Soon enough, Spencer ends up breaking down on Gordon's hill and Gordon must come and help him.Emily's New Coaches 4.5/5:Emily is the newest engine on the Island of Sodor. One day Sir Topham Hatt tells Emily to learn her new route and take some coaches around the island. The only coaches she can find are Annie & Clarabel, but she doesn't know this yet. As she is touring the island, Emily whistles to all the passing engines but no one whistles back. Emily just can't seem to understand why everybody on the Island of Sodor is so unfriendly.The Spotless Record 5/5:Meet Arthur, a tank engine with a spotless record, meaning he has never been naughty or gotten into an accident before. While working with Thomas and Percy, he refuses to join in on bumped the silly freight cars. Thomas soon comes up with a trick that will ruin Arthur's spotless record for good.Peace and Quiet 5/5:Meet Murdoch, a big strong engine who has come to the Island of Sodor to help pull the big and heavy freight trains. Murdoch soon finds out that everyone on the island enjoys talking to each other, but Murdoch would much rather prefer some peace and quiet. The next day, Murdoch gets to travel through the peaceful countryside, at last he has his peace and quiet, but not for long.Jack Jumps In 4.5/5:Meet Jack, the cheerful tractor who has come to work with a construction crew called The Pack and see how his first day goes. First he can't find anybody to work with, then he encounters a big bulldozer named Max, and then he jumps in to help to soon and ends up in a sticky situation.A Friend In Need 4.5/5:After weathering his first day with The Pack, Jack is given a second chance to behave. But when the chance comes for help again, will Jack jump in where he doesn't belong again or will he have learned from his mistake?5 New Engine In The Shed(Music Video) 4/5:A music video that talks about all the new engines in the shed.I also think there were to many uneeded characters in this one(Think ""The Pack"" which includes Alphie, Max, Byron, Oliver, Ned, Kelly, Izabella, and the newest member, Jack) I doubt if they will ever show half these characters again. In fact, the only character they do show now is Emily.

795869,A3J029KBNG5MNP,B00018WML6,Mr. Bey,"[8, 10]","Let me start off with saying how much I hated Alec Bladwin's narrations. He thought Stepney and Iron Arry and Iron Bert needed Austrailian accents in order to sound good but he did away with the Donald and Douglas accents George Carlin did so well. Michael Angelis sounds old but he narrates better than Alce Baldwin. I've also said that they don't ever use the characters they have so why bring new ones. The answer is so that they can sell the wooden trains and Take-Along Thomas. I think that they should either create a new series with Jack and Alfie and their crew or they should do away with them all together the series should still be focused on trains.Ok now for the review part I liked the 4 new trains introduced but they rushed in introducing them becuase none of them were in another episode. Harvey and Salty had yet another minor role they haven't had another major role since their debut tape Salty's Secret. The new trains are Spencer a fast engine who belongs to the Duke and Duchess, Emily the first girl train to become part of the Sodor railway not counting Lady who was only in the movie, Arthur a tank engine who follows the rules and he behaves himself, and Murdouch a ten wheeled engine who enjoys peace and quiet. There are also 7 new trucks, cranes, and bulldozers named Jack, Alfie, Max, Isabella, Oiliver, Byron, and Kelly. Jack is the new truck who helps out Thomas when a bridge collapses and he is eager to help out. The episodes are prety good but they needed to introduce all of these characters in two tapes because they introduced too many. It is still a good tape and I would buy it if I were you.",5,Most of the characters weren't needed but I liked it anyway,1080345600,"03 27, 2004",2004,1634,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'how', 'much', 'hated', 'Alec', 'Bladwin', 'narrations', 'thought', 'Stepney', 'Iron', 'Arry', 'Iron', 'Bert', 'needed', 'Austrailian', 'accents', 'order', 'sound', 'good', 'did', 'away', 'Donald', 'Douglas', 'accents', 'George', 'Carlin', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'Michael', 'Angelis', 'old', 'better', 'Alce', 'Baldwin', ""'ve"", 'also', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'use', 'characters', 'have', 'so', 'why', 'bring', 'new', 'ones', 'answer', 'so', 'can', 'sell', 'wooden', 'trains', 'Take-Along', 'Thomas', 'think', 'should', 'either', 'create', 'new', 'series', 'Jack', 'Alfie', 'crew', 'should', 'do', 'away', 'together', 'series', 'should', 'still', 'be', 'focused', 'trains.Ok', 'now', 'review', 'part', 'liked', '4', 'new', 'trains', 'introduced', 'rushed', 'introducing', 'becuase', 'none', 'were', 'episode', 'Harvey', 'Salty', 'had', 'yet', 'minor', 'role', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'major', 'role', 'debut', 'tape', 'Salty', 'Secret', 'new', 'trains', 'are', 'Spencer', 'fast', 'engine', 'who', 'Duke', 'Duchess', 'Emily', 'first', 'girl', 'train', 'become', 'part', 'Sodor', 'railway', 'not', 'counting', 'Lady', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'movie', 'Arthur', 'tank', 'engine', 'who', 'rules', 'ten', 'wheeled', 'engine', 'who', 'peace', 'quiet', 'are', 'also', '7', 'new', 'trucks', 'cranes', 'bulldozers', 'named', 'Jack', 'Alfie', 'Max', 'Isabella', 'Oiliver', 'Byron', 'Kelly', 'Jack', 'new', 'truck', 'who', 'out', 'Thomas', 'when', 'bridge', 'collapses', 'eager', 'help', 'out', 'episodes', 'are', 'prety', 'good', 'needed', 'introduce', 'characters', 'two', 'tapes', 'introduced', 'too', 'many', 'still', 'good', 'tape', 'would', 'buy', 'were']",N/A

Fearing audience loss, the creators have brought us a construction site overseen by Jenny, our British ""Bob The Builder,"" and it's here that you'll lose it after the blizzard of new vehicles.  It's ridiculous.  The Thomas world has gotten so big that I doubt I'll ever see Peter Sam or even Edward again.So, as the accompany sing-along says, ""There Are Five New Engines In The Shed"" (how can any of them fit?) and Jack the tractor.  The coolest new addition is Spencer.  Okay, I hate all this marketing, but Spencer is a righteous, gray bullet-type train.  It kills me to say that, but it's true.  The rest are pretty dull and uniformly large engines (I assume large engines sell better).  The stories themselves are fairly lifeless.Now for the REALLY BAD news.  This is my third or fourth Thomas DVD review, and I have ripped Alec Baldwin in the past, but heaven knows I miss him now.  They've gone back to a British voice.  The new narrator does give everyone a distinct voice and is obviously a professional, BUT I just don't like his voice.  It's naturally very low and some of his ""choices"" for the characters are unfortunate.  His Sir Topham Hatt is a mumbling, slurring drone, and overall the narrator's pitch is so all-over-the-place that I feel a headache coming on.I know these videos are for kids, but there's only so much bad background noise an adult can withstand.

795871,A1HFKUE4IDNZZ6,B00018WML6,"ReadItDiva ""ReadItDiva""","[0, 0]","I think this DVD is fun to watch for new and seasoned Thomas the Tank Engine fans alike.  Six stories of about four minutes each introduce five new engines to the Island of Sodor: Harvey, Emily, Salty, Murdock, and Arthur.  While the humans in the video are stiff and immovable, the engines speed along the track with various, often comical, expressions.  The stories are:GORDON & SPENCER ? Spencer is a high speed, hardheaded silver express engine who refuses to stop for water during a run.EMILY?S NEW COACHES ? Newcomer Emily borrows Thomas? coaches Annie and Clarabel without asking and alienates herself among the gang.THE SPOTLESS RECORD ? Cheeky Thomas can't resist spoiling the spotless record of big blue tank engine Arthur.PEACE AND QUIET ? Mighty Murdock is all work and no talk, but his chatty station mates just want to get to know him.JACK JUMPS IN ? Safety first! Here come Jack, an energetic red front loader and Alfie, a green excavator.A FRIEND IN NEED ? builds on the previous storyline about Jack and Alfie.The only issue I had with this DVD is the SING ALONG SONG entitled ?Five New Engines in the Shed.?  It invites the viewer to sing along but does not provide the lyrics on screen! But after listening to the song over and over, my daughter easily sang along with the children?s choir.My daughters also liked the FUN & GAMES section.  It offers 3 games that vary in difficulty, a Scrapbook of photos of all the machines on the Island, and Web Fun.  The easiest activity is A DAY AT THE WORKS ? children select the correct paint for each engine.  The next one is REALLY USEFUL ENGINES ? match the correct engine to the clue provided.  This one was a little tougher since my daughters were not familiar with the newer engines.  The hardest activity is REALLY USEFUL PLACES, which requires some knowledge about the Island itself.  If you complete all three activities at one sitting, viewers are rewarded with another catchy Thomas song.For new fans who don?t know who?s who, the SCRAPBOOK is the one to watch.  Narrated by Sir Topham Hatt, it introduces both old and new friends of Thomas.  Select a short video clip to see the friend in action.  Includes: Bertie, Bill & Ben, Bulgy, Bulstrode, Caroline, Cranky, Daisy, Donald & Douglas, Duck, Edward, George, Gordon, Henry, James, Mavis, Percy, Peter Sam, Rusty, Terrence, Thomas, Toby, Trevor, Spencer, then Emily, Murdock, Arthur, Jack, and Alfie.",4,New Friends a Decent Thomas DVD,1090368000,"07 21, 2004",2004,2422,"['think', 'DVD', 'fun', 'watch', 'new', 'seasoned', 'Thomas', 'Tank', 'Engine', 'fans', 'alike', 'Six', 'stories', 'four', 'minutes', 'introduce', 'five', 'new', 'engines', 'Island', 'Sodor', 'Harvey', 'Emily', 'Salty', 'Murdock', 'Arthur', 'humans', 'video', 'are', 'stiff', 'immovable', 'engines', 'speed', 'track', 'various', 'often', 'comical', 'expressions', 'stories', 'are', 'GORDON', 'SPENCER', 'Spencer', 'high', 'speed', 'hardheaded', 'silver', 'express', 'engine', 'who', 'stop', 'water', 'run.EMILY', 'S', 'NEW', 'COACHES', 'Newcomer', 'Emily', 'Thomas', 'coaches', 'Annie', 'Clarabel', 'asking', 'gang.THE', 'SPOTLESS', 'RECORD', 'Cheeky', 'Thomas', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'spoiling', 'spotless', 'record', 'big', 'blue', 'tank', 'engine', 'Arthur.PEACE', 'AND', 'QUIET', 'Mighty', 'Murdock', 'work', 'talk', 'chatty', 'station', 'mates', 'just', 'want', 'get', 'know', 'him.JACK', 'JUMPS', 'IN', 'Safety', 'first', 'Here', 'come', 'Jack', 'energetic', 'red', 'front', 'loader', 'Alfie', 'green', 'excavator.A', 'FRIEND', 'IN', 'NEED', 'builds', 'previous', 'storyline', 'Jack', 'Alfie.The', 'only', 'issue', 'had', 'DVD', 'SING', 'ALONG', 'SONG', 'entitled', 'Five', 'New', 'Engines', 'Shed.', 'viewer', 'sing', 'along', 'not', 'provide', 'lyrics', 'screen', 'listening', 'song', 'daughter', 'easily', 'sang', 'children', 's', 'choir.My', 'daughters', 'also', 'liked', 'FUN', 'GAMES', 'section', '3', 'games', 'vary', 'difficulty', 'Scrapbook', 'photos', 'machines', 'Island', 'Web', 'Fun', 'easiest', 'activity', 'DAY', 'AT', 'THE', 'WORKS', 'children', 'select', 'correct', 'paint', 'engine', 'next', 'one', 'REALLY', 'USEFUL', 'ENGINES', 'match', 'correct', 'engine', 'clue', 'provided', 'one', 'was', 'little', 'tougher', 'daughters', 'were', 'not', 'familiar', 'newer', 'engines', 'hardest', 'activity', 'REALLY', 'USEFUL', 'PLACES', 'knowledge', 'Island', 'complete', 'three', 'activities', 'one', 'sitting', 'viewers', 'are', 'rewarded', 'catchy', 'Thomas', 'new', 'fans', 'who', 'don', 't', 'know', 'who', 's', 'who', 'SCRAPBOOK', 'one', 'watch', 'Narrated', 'Sir', 'Topham', 'Hatt', 'old', 'new', 'friends', 'Thomas', 'Select', 'short', 'video', 'clip', 'see', 'friend', 'action', 'Includes', 'Bertie', 'Bill', 'Ben', 'Bulgy', 'Bulstrode', 'Caroline', 'Cranky', 'Daisy', 'Donald', 'Douglas', 'Duck', 'Edward', 'George', 'Gordon', 'Henry', 'James', 'Mavis', 'Percy', 'Peter', 'Sam', 'Rusty', 'Terrence', 'Thomas', 'Toby', 'Trevor', 'Spencer', 'then', 'Emily', 'Murdock', 'Arthur', 'Jack', 'Alfie']",N/A

She has her own stories, but maybe that's just because female engines aren't shown very often.Next, there is Murdoch, the big strong engine. So far he has appeared in ""Peace And Quiet"" and ""Best Dressed Engine,"" plus he did a cameo in ""Percy And The Flying Carpet.""Second to last, there is Arthur, a big red tank engine who plays by the rules. So far he has apeared in ""The Spotless Record,"" ""Fish"" and ""Something Fishy.""Finally, there is Jack the front loader and his construction crew.

Michael Angelis has narrated the British version of Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends since 1991 (and he still does) , when Carlin was new to the American version. He does a good job with characters like James, Thomas, Gordon, Spencer, and in fact most of his characters but his Sir Topham voice can best be described as sounding like Sean Connery after having too much to drink. Some of the episodes are slightly dull, like Peace and Quiet, and the Jack and Co. episodes introduce tons of characters in 2 episodes and hardly feature Sir Topham Hatt's engines at all! The Spotless Record has an unexplicable  accident and a corny friendship ending, and the Awdrys who created the stories the show was originally based on were much better writers. Perhaps HIT will do something to honor them for the 60th anniversary of Edward, Gordon, and Henry: the oldest 'Thomas' characters.",3,"Not bad, not bad at all",1087862400,"06 22, 2004",2004,921,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'discuss', 'new', 'narrator', 'Michael', 'Angelis', 'narrated', 'British', 'version', 'Thomas', 'Tank', 'Engine', 'Friends', '1991', 'still', 'when', 'Carlin', 'was', 'new', 'American', 'version', 'good', 'job', 'characters', 'James', 'Thomas', 'Gordon', 'Spencer', 'fact', 'most', 'characters', 'Sir', 'Topham', 'voice', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'sounding', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'having', 'too', 'much', 'drink', 'episodes', 'are', 'slightly', 'dull', 'Peace', 'Quiet', 'Jack', 'Co.', 'introduce', 'tons', 'characters', '2', 'episodes', 'hardly', 'feature', 'Sir', 'Topham', 'Hatt', 'engines', 'Spotless', 'Record', 'unexplicable', 'accident', 'corny', 'friendship', 'ending', 'Awdrys', 'who', 'created', 'stories', 'show', 'was', 'originally', 'based', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'writers', 'Perhaps', 'HIT', 'will', 'do', 'something', 'honor', '60th', 'anniversary', 'Edward', 'Gordon', 'Henry', 'oldest', ""'Thomas"", 'characters']",N/A
