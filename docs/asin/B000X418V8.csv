It's the story of two totally awkward and unconventional personalities falling in love and trying to figure out how that even works. Jemaine Clement never really disappoints in my opinion and his general grossness throughout the film (because there's really no other way to describe it) ends up being oddly endearing. It's all just wacky and strange and definitely one I'll be buying for my movie collection. If you like movies like this... check out Gentleman Broncos which is in the same thread.

Nerdy Lily loves the nerdy Jarrod, but he doesn't realize Lily exists, other than to take his burger order. I loved the relationship between Lily and her brother Damon, which was the complete opposite of how Jarrod and his verbally abusive sister treat each other. Lily returns with Jarrod on a visit to his hometown to help him bring closure to a couple past events haunting Jarrod; a bully and the death of Jarrod's older brother. The fight scene between Jarrod and the bully was completely unexpected, but I loved the writer's 'shock treatment' on his audience. When Jarrod finally realizes that Lily is perfect for him it is a wonderful moment. We also get the sense that he's come to terms with his struggle to please his dad and the futile attempts to get out of his big brother's haunting shadow.

1113307,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000X418V8,Cubist,"[5, 7]","Eagle vs Shark is reminiscent of quirky films likeHarold and Maudeand blends together the sensibilities ofNapoleon Dynamite - Like, the Best Special Edition Ever!andMe and You and Everyone We Knowwith oddball outsiders that lead colourful lives. Eagle vs Shark doesn't follow the traditional narrative beats and instead follows its own unique rhythm. Director Taika Waititi gives his film all kinds of personal touches that separate it from other motion pictures. It helps that the film is set in a specific locale with actors who don't try to mask their accents and this adds to the motion picture's exotic appeal. Eagle vs Shark has a hand-made feel and employs old school stop-motion animation in a way that evokes the work ofDirector's Series, Vol. 3 - The Work of Director Michel Gondry. It is one of the many joys of watching a film so obviously made outside of the studio system with no perfect looking movie stars.There is a collection of deleted scenes with an optional commentary by writer/director Taika Waititi. A lot of this footage showcases more of Jarrod's relationship with his family. There is also more of Jarrod getting ready for his showdown with a bully. We also see more of Lily interacting with Jarrod's family.Also included is an ""Outtakes"" reel featuring the cast blowing their lines as they crack each other up.The music video for ""Going Fishing"" by the Phoenix Foundation is a catchy indie song featuring lots of clips from the film.Finally, there is an audio commentary by Waititi. Early on he gets Loren Horsley on the phone and they talk about an alternate opening credits animation that they ultimately rejected. They also point out all of their friends that populate the backgrounds of various scenes.

1113308,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B000X418V8,Dr. E,"[6, 9]","The comparisons toNapoleon Dynamiteare somewhat fair. Jemaine Clement's character, Jarrod, is painfully awkward and shows some of the same stiff mannerisms of Heder's notorious character (plus, the kooky glasses and bad hair only foster the seeming similarities). But, here's the thing ... I thoughtNapoleon Dynamitelacked both relevance and a heart; moreover, its ""randomness"" tends to amuse the college-crowd, but not full-fledged adults. So, let's consider Eagle Vs. Shark as sort ofNapoleon Dynamite(with a touch ofLittle Miss Sunshine, but only the good aspects) for ""grown-ups.""Jarrod is a complex character (unlike the flat Dynamite). He lives in the shadow of his dead brother-- whose ribbons, trophies and awards festoon his father's home (a little reminder to Jarrod of the man he can never become). His desperation to please his stoic father leads him to hurtful decisions. Frequently, the viewer is alienated from Jarrod, disdaining his selfish cruelty. Still, director/writer Taika Cohen allows Jarrod great sympathy. The viewer hopes for a transformation ... if only for Lily's sake.Loren Horsley's character, Lily, shares a quiet life with her brother. The relationship is sweet and nurturing ... unlike Jarrod's relationship with his family which revolves around vulgar name-calling (underscoring the arrested development of the family). Lily is opened hearted, but not a fool ... as Jarrod will soon learn.The film's mise en scene is gorgeous ... the opening sequence (alone) stole my breath. I very much enjoyed the playfulness of the cinematography ... I wish we would see more this risk-taking in American film. Furthermore, the stop-motion animation is initially jarring, but becomes crucial to the over-all message. Surprisingly cute and oddly compelling.Yes, some elements of this work are predictable, but that's true of most films. And entirely forgivable.If you're into swishy jogging suits and off-beat romance, give this film a chance. But, a note of caution, rent this work before buying it.

Just a nifty script and the right people pulling the right levers.Here's the scoop. Lily works at a franchise burger joint in a mall. Across from her, at a movie store, works Jarrod. Both are major dweebs. He has serious issues with self esteem and she's not far behind, but she's warm for his form. She gets sacked and, through a minor fluke, ends up at a party he's throwing. Now she's in his radar. She travels with him to his family's home where he figures to settle an age old score with a bully. Revelations abound.Yup. Underdog nerds wallpaper the entire film. You've never witnessed such a huge number of misfits at one time in your entire life. These folk have not a clue. This is a short putt from ""Napoleon Dynamite"" in both content and form, but I didn't care. These people are a stitch. Watching Jarrod train for his major bout, or watching his sister and brother in law try to sell unsellable stuff, has to be seen to be believed. And Jarrod's young daughter must be in line for a nerd-cutie award. She's a doll who adds that little something to the proceedings. Other than Lily seeing Jarrod's dark side, and wondering if she can maintain a lifelong relationship with him, there really isn't a story or character arc here. But to see these people search for their place in the world is satisfying.Loren Horsley as Lily (who also helped write the script) seems quite lovely, but did a great job dumbing herself down. Jermaine Clement plays Jarrod and, likewise, does a good job. All the second tier actors are well worth the price of admission. This is simply fun, Indy fare.

I am a huge fan of Flight of the Conchords, which is witty, clever, beautifully photographed, well acted, and wildly funny. This is none of those things. The main characters are not very interesting at best, or, in the case of Jarrod, massively irritating. A selfish jerk, a self-absorbed fool, an inarticulate bore, an utterly un-self aware misogynist, and a lying, grubby phony, he offers not one reason to care about him. Tossing aside everyone and everything, he is a one-man wrecking crew, destroying and punishing all around him. For a man so desperate for his father's approval, you would think he would offer some fathering to his daughter, but no, he never cares about her in any way. Jarrod is a miserable jerk, the kind of person you'd run from in a heartbeat. I was repelled by every aspect of him.No need to go on at length. I cannot imagine how this got the accolades it did.

Delivering his lines in a flat monotone, he conveys the emotional range of an Intel microprocessor.The New Zealand accents are so thick that, at time, American viewers would appreciate English subtitles (which I later learned are actually available with the DVD - consider activating).

1113315,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B000X418V8,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","I'm even now, a week after screening the film, still trying to process it.This has the look and feel of a very low budget independent. But despite the simple stages and unfinished facade, I can discern a much more polished and sophisticated hand in the craftsmanship. The depth of story presented in this movie is difficult to categorize. And that particular kind of difficulty, to me, speaks of a visionary talent.Tells the tale of two very offbeat people and their circle of equally odd family and friends. Although these characters seem much more than the usual motley group of shy wallflowers and social outcasts. My understanding of high-functioning autistics is limited - but many of the characters, especially the principals, seem to exhibit behaviors that I associate with such individuals.Lily is a wonderfully sweet and unassuming young woman who works the counter at a burger joint. A pariah among her fellow workers, she's constantly dismissed, disrespected and generally treated very poorly. Her only perk - the daily lunch visit by a video sales clerk in a neighboring business. He's the male Yin to her Yang. Not just emotionally, but physically, as she feels connected by virtue of a shared facial beauty mark. She's obviously smitten, but the object of her affection is unaware; completely oblivious to the signals being sent. We soon find out why.The bespectacled video store employee is Jarrod, a strange young man who only makes intermitent eye contact and communicates in terse, brittle statements of fact. No inflection, pitch or verse - just a monotone drone of transmitted information. Unless he's upset, which is often. And importantly, doesn't seem to appreciate the rather intense amorous attention being pointed in his direction.Sadly, Lily's odd behavior and inability to socialize with her fellow co-workers has created tension perceived too difficult to manage, and a staged bogus reduction-in-force is enacted; essentially firing her under a false pretext. But this cowardly act is actually a blessing in disguise, freeing her to take action on her feelings. She picks up a tossed invitation from the garbage, originally intended for a co-worker, to a costume party being thrown by Jarrod and his friends. So begins the tale of The Eagle and The Shark, as Lily discovers that her new beau is a man on a very unusual, almost quixotic, mission.These two misfits somehow, almost magically, manage to find one another along the rough back roads of life. In exploring this fascinating mating dance, the cast reveals a completely oblique love story that's both tender and uncomfortable.Very reminiscent of the documentary 'Crumb', though thankfully benign and less tragic.Movie Note:- What I mean by visionary: The intensely subtle nuance crafted by Director Taika Waititi. If you look closely at Jarrod's bedroom, every single item is a powerful description of just who and what he is. The obsessive/compulsive need to outline tools on a work board, fastidiously detailed model airplanes, superhero figurines, crude drawings of himself as a 'man/bear' and warrior, mounted martial arts weapons on the wall, and a puma lion drawing over his bedboard - taken collectively scream volumes that he's only an adult by virtue of chronological date, a boy in a man's body. Yet that scene is less than 30 seconds of the film; you actually have to freeze-frame it in order to grasp the amazing attention to detail.And later, we learn that his creativity is born less from a desire for personal expression and more a reflection of his jealousy - a dead older brother that had accomplished all the feats that he cannot quite grasp. Where Jarrod puts up martial art posters and hangs asian weapons on the wall - his brother earned a black belt in karate. Sketches that Jarrod attempts are a pale reflection of his late brother's ability to paint. And so on.It's a profound moment when Lily enters both bedrooms and grasps the source of Jarrod's conflicted passions and sense of impotence.Again, to me, speaks volumes of a sublime filmmaker and his craft.",4,Deeply Fascinating And Quirky New Zealand Flick,1339200000,"06 9, 2012",2012,4068,"[""'m"", 'even', 'now', 'week', 'screening', 'film', 'still', 'trying', 'process', 'it.This', 'look', 'feel', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'independent', 'simple', 'stages', 'unfinished', 'facade', 'can', 'discern', 'much', 'more', 'polished', 'sophisticated', 'hand', 'craftsmanship', 'depth', 'story', 'presented', 'movie', 'difficult', 'categorize', 'particular', 'kind', 'difficulty', 'speaks', 'visionary', 'tale', 'two', 'very', 'offbeat', 'people', 'circle', 'equally', 'odd', 'family', 'friends', 'characters', 'seem', 'much', 'more', 'usual', 'motley', 'group', 'shy', 'wallflowers', 'social', 'outcasts', 'understanding', 'high-functioning', 'autistics', 'limited', 'many', 'characters', 'especially', 'principals', 'seem', 'exhibit', 'behaviors', 'associate', 'such', 'individuals.Lily', 'wonderfully', 'sweet', 'unassuming', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'counter', 'burger', 'joint', 'pariah', 'fellow', 'workers', 'constantly', 'dismissed', 'disrespected', 'generally', 'treated', 'very', 'poorly', 'only', 'perk', 'daily', 'lunch', 'visit', 'video', 'sales', 'clerk', 'neighboring', 'business', 'male', 'Yin', 'Yang', 'Not', 'just', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'connected', 'virtue', 'shared', 'facial', 'beauty', 'mark', 'obviously', 'smitten', 'object', 'affection', 'unaware', 'completely', 'oblivious', 'signals', 'being', 'sent', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'why.The', 'bespectacled', 'video', 'store', 'employee', 'Jarrod', 'strange', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'only', 'intermitent', 'eye', 'contact', 'communicates', 'terse', 'brittle', 'statements', 'fact', 'inflection', 'pitch', 'verse', 'just', 'monotone', 'drone', 'transmitted', 'information', 'upset', 'often', 'importantly', ""n't"", 'seem', 'appreciate', 'rather', 'intense', 'amorous', 'attention', 'being', 'pointed', 'direction.Sadly', 'Lily', 'odd', 'behavior', 'inability', 'socialize', 'fellow', 'co-workers', 'created', 'tension', 'perceived', 'too', 'difficult', 'manage', 'staged', 'bogus', 'reduction-in-force', 'enacted', 'essentially', 'firing', 'false', 'pretext', 'cowardly', 'act', 'actually', 'blessing', 'disguise', 'freeing', 'take', 'action', 'feelings', 'up', 'tossed', 'invitation', 'garbage', 'originally', 'intended', 'co-worker', 'costume', 'party', 'being', 'thrown', 'Jarrod', 'friends', 'So', 'tale', 'Eagle', 'Shark', 'Lily', 'new', 'beau', 'man', 'very', 'unusual', 'almost', 'quixotic', 'mission.These', 'two', 'misfits', 'somehow', 'almost', 'magically', 'manage', 'find', 'one', 'rough', 'back', 'roads', 'life', 'exploring', 'fascinating', 'mating', 'dance', 'cast', 'completely', 'oblique', 'love', 'story', 'tender', 'uncomfortable.Very', 'reminiscent', 'documentary', ""'Crumb"", 'thankfully', 'benign', 'less', 'tragic.Movie', 'Note', 'What', 'mean', 'visionary', 'intensely', 'subtle', 'nuance', 'crafted', 'Director', 'Taika', 'Waititi', 'look', 'closely', 'Jarrod', 'bedroom', 'single', 'item', 'powerful', 'description', 'just', 'who', 'what', 'obsessive/compulsive', 'need', 'outline', 'tools', 'work', 'board', 'fastidiously', 'detailed', 'model', 'airplanes', 'superhero', 'figurines', 'crude', 'drawings', ""'man/bear"", 'warrior', 'mounted', 'martial', 'arts', 'weapons', 'wall', 'puma', 'lion', 'drawing', 'bedboard', 'taken', 'collectively', 'scream', 'volumes', 'only', 'adult', 'virtue', 'chronological', 'date', 'boy', 'man', 'body', 'scene', 'less', '30', 'seconds', 'film', 'actually', 'have', 'freeze-frame', 'order', 'grasp', 'amazing', 'attention', 'detail.And', 'later', 'learn', 'creativity', 'born', 'less', 'desire', 'personal', 'expression', 'more', 'reflection', 'jealousy', 'dead', 'older', 'brother', 'had', 'accomplished', 'feats', 'can', 'not', 'quite', 'grasp', 'Where', 'Jarrod', 'up', 'martial', 'art', 'posters', 'hangs', 'asian', 'weapons', 'wall', 'brother', 'earned', 'black', 'belt', 'karate', 'Sketches', 'Jarrod', 'attempts', 'are', 'pale', 'reflection', 'late', 'brother', 'ability', 'paint', 'so', 'profound', 'moment', 'when', 'Lily', 'bedrooms', 'grasps', 'source', 'Jarrod', 'conflicted', 'passions', 'sense', 'impotence.Again', 'volumes', 'sublime', 'filmmaker', 'craft']",EAGLE VS.

But she takes it on the chin and remains curiously sweet. She's got a crush on Jarrod, a narcissist geek with a horrible mullet played by Jemaine Clement of Flight of the Conchords fame. Jarrod and Lilly hook up at a party one night. (Do you want to have sex? OK.) Jarrod has a mission-to crush a samoan lad who tortured him in school. He returns home to fight his nemesis. I won't give it away, but the ending to this movie had me laughing hysterically.  This is a completely original script absent banal comedy and full of emotional depth. You won't see films like this coming out of Hollywood these days. Thank you Taika and the NZ Film Commission.Many people have compared Eagle to Napoleon Dynamite, but I find the comparison lacking. Yes, Lily and Jarrod are geeks, but the similarities with Napoleon end there. This isn't a geek revenge movie though the plot may seem like that on the face of it. The movie is titled Eagle vs. Shark but it could be titled man vs. woman. Neither Lily or Jarrod run to each other as solace from the outside world. Lily has a warm home life with her brother and Jarrod is pretty solidly convinced of his stature and his ability with women until the end of the movie. It's interesting to see how Lily turns Jarod around. This film is about the balance of power between Lily and Jarod, not geeks vs the world.There are a lot of good minor characters in this film including Jarrod's sister and her husband and Lily's brother. Jarrod's daughter is played brilliantly by an eccentric little girl whose name I can't find on the DVD. She's cute to watch. I liked Lorena's performance. She brings strength to her role as Lily but doesn't come off aggressive. It must have been a difficult role to play right.Good extras on the film including some nice deleted scenes. The commentary with Taika was a little off putting. He seems a bit over it. His girlfriend, Lorena Horsely who plays Lily calls from NZ and they talk a bit about the film, but neither one of them seem very into it. It seems like the commentary was added a long long time after the film was made and maybe thrown in because of the success of Conchords. The most interesting commentary comes from the guy that plays Jarrod's brother in law. Taika says things like ""that scene comes from the Sundance film workshop"" but doesn't explain what that is or why he was there. Flight of the Conchords fans don't buy Eagle to hear any interviews or commentary with Jemaine. He is curiously absent from all the extras here as he was with Conchords. Jemaine seems more over it all these days than anyone. I doubt HBO will get a season 3 out of him unless they throw him mad mad money.There are a lot of great views of NZ in this film. Loved the camera shot on the playground with Lily running in the mouse wheel with the bay out the back. Gorgeous.  Good music from the Phoenix FoundationHorsepower,Pegasusthat works well with the film. The soundtrack wasn't chosen for marketing purposes, it actually works with what's going on in the film.When I see a good film like this, completed for under a million dollars, you wonder what is going on in Hollywood these days that more films like this aren't made.
