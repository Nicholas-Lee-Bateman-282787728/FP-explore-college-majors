If past experience means anything &#34;original UK edition&#34; means the buyer gets the same content the British viewer/buyer got with very little PBS intro stuff added on- I prefer to see original style credits and content.The stories, as always, are good but I think I prefer # 1 &#34; The soul of Genius&#34; over the others. With any luck all of Lewis will eventually find it's way to Blu ray. I hope to see more in the years to come too.Not that most people will be interested but  a couple of guest stars; Ciaran McMenamin ( final season of Primeval) was in # 3 &#34;Fearful Symmetry&#34; , and an almost unrecognizable David Soul ( when have you seen him in anything ?) was in # 4 &#34;The Indelible Stain&#34;.

Inspector Lewis is less overbearing and has an astute and intelligent sergeant of his own.  It is interesting to watch the characters grow and mature.  I only wish that we'd had a bit more time with Morse before John Thaw passed away as his character did.  For Lewis fans this series continues with the characters that we have learned to embrace.  For anyone else, give these crime solvers a try.  I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed.  The episodes, as they have always done, have connecting threads.

Inspector Morse staring John Thaw was a brilliant detective series so if you like Inspector Lewis I hope you would also like Inspector Morse or the more recent Endeavor which covers the early career of Inspector Morse when he first joined the police in the 1960s  My only disappointment is that Morse was 100 minutes long while Inspector Lewis has been 89 minutes long.  It makes a big difference.  In season 7 the episodes were split into two 45 minute episodes.  I hate the format but I am a hopeless addict.

1537615,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B007T40F14,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[26, 31]","This box series includes The Soul of Genius, Generation of Vipers, Fearful Symmetry, and The Indelible Stain.  These were aired in the UK between May and June 2012 as UK Series 6.  Hence US Series 5 is the same as UK series 6.  I believe that each of these episodes is edited down by 10 minutes so as to fit the 90 minute time slot in the Masterpiece Mystery series.It is hard to put your finger on just what makes Lewis work so well.  However, a large part of its success must be down to the chemistry between Lewis, played by Kevin Whately and Hathaway (Laurence Fox).  Hathaway acts as an excellent foil for Lewis in much the same way that Lewis himself previously did for Morse and the result is at least as effective.  It is hard to remember now that this series was a spin off from Inspector Morse following the death of John Thaw and its pilot aired as recently as 2006.  It feels like it has been around much longer than that and has almost become an institution.This series follows the strong tradition set by the earlier series.  We thought that Oxford seemed like a dangerous place to live as the body count mounted during the time of Inspector Morse.  Lewis continues to add rather alarmingly to the death toll.  As previously these episodes are quite varied.  For example, this time round one episode concerns the strange death of a babysitter, whilst the final episode involves the mysterious death of a visiting lecturer which may have racial overtones.  The lengthy feature film format gives the stories time to develop fully in an unhurried manner.It is interesting that as this series has progressed, DS James Hathaway has become as significant a figure as Inspector Robbie Lewis and it is hard to imagine Lewis without him. It is very similar to the way Lewis became a central figure alongside Inspector Morse. It is an interesting statistic that the character of Lewis was introduced as long ago as 1986 so it is hardly surprising that we have grown rather used to him in the intervening 26 years! As always the rather regal buildings of Oxford provide an excellent backdrop for the series.It is very pleasing that a further series has already been commissioned.  The four episodes in this series mean that we now have 24 in all so far and with Series 7 that will make 28.  Inspector Morse only ran to 33 so it seems very likely that Lewis will exceed even that which will be quite an accolade.",5,Maintains the Previous Excellent Standard,1339459200,"06 12, 2012",2012,2414,"['box', 'series', 'Soul', 'Genius', 'Generation', 'Vipers', 'Fearful', 'Symmetry', 'Indelible', 'Stain', 'were', 'aired', 'UK', 'May', 'June', '2012', 'UK', 'Series', '6', 'Hence', 'US', 'Series', '5', 'same', 'UK', 'series', '6', 'believe', 'episodes', 'edited', 'down', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'fit', '90', 'minute', 'time', 'slot', 'Masterpiece', 'Mystery', 'series.It', 'hard', 'put', 'finger', 'just', 'what', 'Lewis', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'However', 'large', 'part', 'success', 'must', 'be', 'down', 'chemistry', 'Lewis', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'Hathaway', 'Laurence', 'Fox', 'Hathaway', 'excellent', 'foil', 'Lewis', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Lewis', 'previously', 'did', 'Morse', 'result', 'least', 'effective', 'hard', 'remember', 'now', 'series', 'was', 'spin', 'off', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'following', 'death', 'John', 'Thaw', 'pilot', 'aired', 'as', 'recently', '2006', 'been', 'around', 'much', 'longer', 'almost', 'become', 'institution.This', 'series', 'strong', 'tradition', 'set', 'earlier', 'series', 'thought', 'Oxford', 'seemed', 'dangerous', 'place', 'live', 'body', 'count', 'mounted', 'time', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'add', 'rather', 'alarmingly', 'death', 'toll', 'previously', 'episodes', 'are', 'quite', 'varied', 'example', 'time', 'round', 'one', 'episode', 'strange', 'death', 'babysitter', 'final', 'episode', 'mysterious', 'death', 'visiting', 'lecturer', 'may', 'have', 'racial', 'overtones', 'lengthy', 'feature', 'film', 'format', 'stories', 'time', 'develop', 'fully', 'unhurried', 'manner.It', 'interesting', 'series', 'progressed', 'DS', 'James', 'Hathaway', 'become', 'significant', 'figure', 'Inspector', 'Robbie', 'Lewis', 'hard', 'imagine', 'Lewis', 'very', 'similar', 'way', 'Lewis', 'became', 'central', 'figure', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'interesting', 'statistic', 'character', 'Lewis', 'was', 'introduced', 'long', 'ago', '1986', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'have', 'grown', 'rather', 'used', 'intervening', '26', 'years', 'always', 'rather', 'regal', 'buildings', 'Oxford', 'provide', 'excellent', 'backdrop', 'series.It', 'very', 'pleasing', 'further', 'series', 'already', 'been', 'commissioned', 'four', 'episodes', 'series', 'now', 'have', '24', 'so', 'far', 'Series', '7', 'will', 'make', '28', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'only', 'ran', '33', 'very', 'likely', 'Lewis', 'will', 'exceed', 'even', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'accolade']",N/A

1537684,A1HD5KASZ7F36S,B007T40F14,History Man,"[2, 2]","I picked up the Series 5 DVD set and was delighted to see that all episodes are the original, complete versions as originally aired in the U.K.  Each episode runs between 1:30 and 1:33, where the versions shown on PBS's ""Masterpiece Mystery"" series have been cut to approximately 1:20, omitting ten minutes or more from each episode.  That may not seem like a big deal, but believe me, the episodes are much improved in their original, longer versions.  Watching this series on PBS, I always thought something was wrong about them, but I couldn't put my finger on it.  Although it is an excellent series and worthy successor to ""Inspector Morse,"" it somehow kept falling short.  Now I see that the episodes are somewhat rushed or paced too fast for the Morse/Lewis mold because PBS eliminated the kind of scenes that flesh out characters more or give us some personal insight into the minds and feelings of Lewis, Hathaway and Hobson.  The full versions give us time to reflect on the case and how it is affecting the main characters by providing a more appropriate, less rushed pace.In truth, the Morse series was very often more about Morse, his personality, his demons, his feelings and how cases affected him than they were about the mysteries he was trying to solve.  I believe it was the series' strongest attraction, although the scripts and productions were first rate throughout.  Those programs ran 100 minutes or more, allowing time to see all of the characters and suspects evolve, for the evidence to gradually come forward, and for us to mentally work through the case along with Morse and Lewis.  It also provided time to see Morse outside of his job and to understand what kind of man he was, what motivated him and how the case, or life in general, was impacting him.  He was a lot more than a cardboard-cutout, by-the-numbers sleuth.  Lewis is not the same kind of compelling, complex character that Morse was, although he has his own appeal and personal baggage, and Kevin Whately is wonderful in the role.  Hathaway is actually more like Morse - more introspective, well-educated and well-read, scholarly and, in some ways, more sensitve than Lewis, who is more world-weary and toughened than he was as Morse's young sergeant.  That chemistry works in ways similar to the Morse series while maintaining a unique and appealing character for ""Lewis"" (which is the actual U.K. title of the series).

1537705,A28YDMI499J1X9,B007T40F14,J. Janssen,"[14, 21]","Shortly after PBS aired the premier episode of Inspector Lewis the PBS Mystery venue was re-tooled into Masterpiece Mystery. Masterpiece then became a co-producer of certain properties, Inspector Lewis being one of the first.  Among other changes Masterpiece exerted creative control over ""Lewis"" by reducing the run time which allowed PBS to better fit the episodes into the fixed 90 minute window Masterpiece Mystery would soon occupy.  UK television  airs essentially the same product in a two hour commercial television slot that now allows for a couple extra commercials and extended previews of coming attractions.  Self serving claims of shipping the ""original UK edition"" to the contrary, PBS didn't expand the US offering, they shortened the UK version.If you go back and review the ""Lewis"" premier you'd find a show devoted to Morse's long suffering Sergeant, now a Detective Inspector, returning to Thames Valley after an extended overseas assignment. It was a feature length production which cast Lewis somewhat in the role of having to re-prove himself to a new, younger, and female superintendent thereby capturing some of that outsider feel that the ""Morse"" shows excelled at. The first season had several references to Morse episodes which allowed Lewis to reflect on the complex relationship and reminisce about his late mentor. The implied promise of flashbacks and new takes on old cases was stimulating for those of us who loved the original series. Unfortunately that promise has not been kept and the last several seasons seem to have lost any affiliation the show had as a sequel. Recent episodes have offered few references to Morse and they seem to be going out of their way to distance the new production from it's predecessor.  Perhaps the writers were not up to the task of connecting the two shows or possibly it's a managed attempt to carve out a new drama not owing anything to the past. But, for whatever reason, the Lewis episodes are starting to seem mundane and ordinary with way too little of the Morse legacy shining through. Even the dramatic premise of Lewis coming face to face with his wife's hit and run killer was handled as a secondary subplot in a rather ordinary story which made it feel like they just wanted to get it over with and turn the series into ""Sergeant Hathaway"".  The show currently lacks a dominant central character and seems intent on creating a troubled but politically correct one out of Hathaway rather than letting Lewis take his rightful spot on center stage.I struggled over the star rating I gave ""Lewis Series 5"" and I'm still not comfortable that 2 stars is fair.  If you view the episodes as a stand alone series and accept that it's just a police procedural about a Brit college town rather than being a personality driven drama such as it's predecessor, a case could be made to affix 3 or possibly even 4 stars.  But as a sequel (which PBS trumpets it to be) it has problems that are not going to be solved by coyly questioning the sexual orientation of one of the leads, or parading a rotating cast of characterless twenty somethings in front of the viewers every week.  If you dig down into the stories and try to analyze why they don't have the lasting impact that the Morse episodes did you might come to the conclusion that the victims, witnesses, and suspects just aren't that interesting.  There's no great pathos about the crimes, no sense of a life gone off the rails, no social expense to be paid.  The characters just don't seem to matter very much. There are exceptions of course, but these are few and far between and certainly disappointing given the  wealth of material the writers could avail themselves of.  I put most of the blame for this on the quality of the writing itself.  Time and again they go back to the same tired themes of questioning why Hathaway left Divinity school, is he or isn't he gay, or is there or isn't there a romantic relationship between Lewis and Dr. Hobson.  They can't seem to decide which way they want to go and instead either forget they've covered this turf before, or assume the audience enjoys pondering these questions ad infinitum. This inability to cast a cohesive narrative of Lewis' persona and build on it episode by episode is largely what separates Lewis from the much more effective ""Inspector Morse"".  In every Morse episode the viewer learned more about the title character, his strengths and his weaknesses.  To date we don't know much more about Lewis than we learned in the premier.There's no doubt that PBS is trying to draw a younger audience to it's dramatic lineup and ""Inspector Lewis"" is not immune to focus group tampering.  If you examine the episodes from the beginning you'll find the preponderance of story lines about college students, young faculty instructors, and a particular obsession with promoting the Hathaway character as if he were the namesake of the show.  For some inexplicable reason the producers of ""Lewis"" chose to turn the time honored Oxford social tension of ""town and gown"" into all gown and no town. What's lacking here are quality scripts dealing with diverse subjects and those wonderful English character actors cast to bring nuance and introspection to a show that's supposed to be a sequel to one of the  best detective dramas ever produced.I hope PBS re-evaluates their vision for ""Lewis"" rather than just let it drift along as they seem to be doing.  Perhaps by eliminating one film from a future ""Series 6"" they  might be able to afford a top tier writer such as Anthony Horowitz to come in and craft a signature episode that imbues D.I. Lewis with characteristics befitting a protege of Morse.  Perhaps a current connection to one of Morse's former cases or maybe a new sergeant would shift the focus away from the mundane college centric themes the last several seasons have suffered through.  I don't  dislike Laurence Fox, but I think he's miscast as the DS.  Just about every Brit police drama has a mentor/protege relationship between the title character and his sergeant.  Many of the problems with this production stem from the concept of the two characters essentially sharing the lead. Only a very few of the Morse episodes actually dealt with the university directly while the Lewis series seems intent on becoming a campus police procedural.  Perhaps using the Morse convention of occasionally moving the production out of Oxford into foreign locales such as was done in ""Promised Land"" or ""The Death of the Self"" might provide the artistic spark to spur the production on to more interesting  and  diverse stories.  Regardless, some change needs to be made as the current episodes are becoming indistinguishable from each other.  I was hopeful that they had turned the corner after Series 4 as those episodes displayed a degree of maturity and nuance missing in previous years.  Unfortunately, Series 5 shows a  depressing return to form.",2,"A show of great promise, now in decline",1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,6934,"['Shortly', 'PBS', 'aired', 'premier', 'episode',

Back to Lewis -- I've watched all of them and the writing has gotten better and better. The real story in these episodes is the slow enhancement of James Hathaway's character. He is getting better lines, smarter lines. Maybe there's another spinoff coming and Hathaway will get his own show. In the meantime, though, the Inspector Lewis series is one of the best going. The ensemble -- the doctor, the chief inspector, Lewis and Hathaway have all settled into their roles.

In most episodes, the stories begin with a rather unpleasant murder at Oxford University which provides a beautiful backdrop and setting for the murder investigation.

Kevin Whatley, who was the sidekick on the Inspector Morse series, is now the lead while Laurence Fox plays the highly educated, introspective sidekick.

1537772,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B007T40F14,mirasreviews,"[14, 17]","""Inspector Lewis"" Series 5 maintains the quality of the last few seasons, which is to say that the episodes are entertaining but the writing is inconsistent. The plots are improbable, of course, but credibility is stretched to the breaking point in ""Fearful Symmetry"", in which it seems like everyone in Oxford has a connection to an obscure simian research lab. In ""Generation of Vipers"", the detectives make liberal use of CCTV and private information from the internet, which makes me wonder if the writers are trying to promote the UK's growing surveillance programs or question them. Also in that episode, critical information that cracks the case comes from a journalist who turns up something obvious, not from detective work. I didn't know what to make of that.In any case, DI Robbie Lewis (Kevin Whately) and partner DS James Hathaway (Laurence Fox) still have a nice chemistry. Chief Superintendent Innocent (Rebecca Front) returns as their boss, though she has very little to do this season. Pathologist Dr. Laura Hobson (Clare Holman) is also back and still Lewis' might-be-but-never-quite love interest. Series 5 introduces a couple of new recurring characters in the competitive DI Peterson (Jason Durr) and striking young DC Julie Lockhart (Kemi-Bo Jacobs), who does a lot of spade work for Lewis and Hathaway. This is Series 6 in the UK, by the way. Entertaining, with lots of great Oxford locales. The episodes are:In ""The Soul of Genius"", the body of English professor Murray Hawes is found buried in the woods by botanist Liz Nash (Nadine Lewington). Hawes was obsessed with solving a mystery hidden in Lewis Carroll's ""The Hunting of the Snark"", so much so that he had recently purchased a rare manuscript of the poem. As Lewis and Hathaway dig around at nearby Oxford Botanical Gardens, which Hawes frequented, and interview his manipulative brother Rev. Coner Hawes (Alex Jennings), an amateur sleuth named Michelle Marber (Celia Imrie) is also on the trail. She believes the death had something to do with drug trials that Hawes participated in under a Dr. Alex Falconer (James Fleet), but her investigation threatens to interfere with the professional detective work.""Generation of Vipers"" finds a lonely Oxford English professor dead in her home after a video she submitted to a dating web site was pirated for all to see on a site called Barker. It looks like a suicide, as Professor Miranda Thornton (Julie Cox) had painkillers in her stomach. But Lewis and Hathaway aren't sure, because the cassette tape from her antiquated answering machine is missing. Investigations lead to a web of relationships from twenty years ago, when Thornton was at school. Kit Renton (Daniel Lapaine), owner of the Barker web site, was at school with her, as was Susanna Leland (Kate Maravan), owner of the dating site to which the video was posted, and David Connelly (Toby Stephens), a real estate developer with whom Thornton was doing battle.All roads lead, oddly, to a research lab for simian neuroscience in ""Fearful Symmetry"". When Nick (Ciar&aacute;n McMenamin) and Honey Addams (Georgia Taylor) return home from a party, they find their babysitter Jessica Lake (Abigail Hardingham) dead and bound to a bed in a fetishistic pose. Jessica had been filling in for her friend Yasmin Randall (Leila Mimmack), who works at the lab under the tutelage of Dr. Joshua Ezrin (Gregor Truter) and Dr. Bob Massey (Con O'Neill), father of Jessica's boyfriend Gideon (Pierro Niel-Mee). Some art photos taken by controversial anthropologist and social pundit Marion Hammond (Lucy Cohu), depicting Jessica in a similar pose to the one in which she was found, may be the only clue to the identity of her killer.""The Indelible Stain"" also harkens back to events at Oxford decades ago. Dr. Paul Yelland (David Soul) gives a controversial lecture about a new theory of ""criminal dangerousness"" and is later found dead in his room. Ch Supt Innocent encourages the detectives to wrap this case up quickly, as the department had declined to provide Yelland with security. Initially, protesters who crashed the professor's lecture are suspect, but the criminologist who invited him, Prof. Anne Rand (Nancy Carroll), was cruelly using him . Her husband, Robert Fraser (Patrick Baladi), is having an affair with his accomplished student Nina Clemens (Pippa Bennet Warner), who might have motive for murder. And administrator Lillian Hunter (Nina Sosanya) has a connection to Yelland from long ago.",4,"The Writing Is a Mixed Bag, but Lewis & Hathaway Entertain for Another Series.",1343606400,"07 30, 2012",2012,4486,"['Inspector', 'Lewis', '5', 'quality', 'last', 'few', 'seasons', 'say', 'episodes', 'are', 'entertaining', 'writing', 'inconsistent', 'plots', 'are', 'improbable', 'course', 'credibility', 'stretched', 'breaking', 'point', 'Fearful', 'Symmetry', 'everyone', 'Oxford', 'connection', 'obscure', 'simian', 'research', 'lab', 'Generation', 'Vipers', 'detectives', 'make', 'liberal', 'use', 'CCTV', 'private', 'information', 'internet', 'wonder', 'writers', 'are', 'trying', 'promote', 'UK', 'growing', 'surveillance', 'programs', 'question', 'Also', 'episode', 'critical', 'information', 'case', 'journalist', 'who', 'up', 'something', 'obvious', 'not', 'detective', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'make', 'that.In', 'case', 'DI', 'Robbie', 'Lewis', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'partner', 'DS', 'James', 'Hathaway', 'Laurence', 'Fox', 'still', 'have', 'nice', 'chemistry', 'Chief', 'Superintendent', 'Innocent', 'Rebecca', 'Front', 'boss', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'season', 'Pathologist', 'Dr.', 'Laura', 'Hobson', 'Clare', 'Holman', 'also', 'back', 'still', 'Lewis', 'might-be-but-never-quite', 'love', 'interest', 'Series', '5', 'introduces', 'couple', 'new', 'recurring', 'characters', 'competitive', 'DI', 'Peterson', 'Jason', 'Durr', 'striking', 'young', 'DC', 'Julie', 'Lockhart', 'Kemi-Bo', 'Jacobs', 'who', 'lot', 'spade', 'work', 'Lewis', 'Hathaway', 'Series', '6', 'UK', 'way', 'Entertaining', 'lots', 'great', 'Oxford', 'episodes', 'are', 'Soul', 'Genius', 'body', 'English', 'professor', 'Murray', 'Hawes', 'found', 'buried', 'woods', 'botanist', 'Liz', 'Nash', 'Nadine', 'Lewington', 'Hawes', 'was', 'obsessed', 'solving', 'mystery', 'hidden', 'Lewis', 'Carroll', 'Hunting', 'Snark', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'recently', 'purchased', 'rare', 'manuscript', 'poem', 'Lewis', 'Hathaway', 'dig', 'around', 'nearby', 'Oxford', 'Botanical', 'Gardens', 'Hawes', 'frequented', 'interview', 'manipulative', 'brother', 'Rev', 'Coner', 'Hawes', 'Alex', 'Jennings', 'amateur', 'sleuth', 'named', 'Michelle', 'Marber', 'Celia', 'Imrie', 'also', 'trail', 'death', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'drug', 'trials', 'Hawes', 'participated', 'Dr.', 'Alex', 'Falconer', 'James', 'Fleet', 'investigation', 'interfere', 'professional', 'detective', 'work', 'Generation', 'Vipers', 'lonely', 'Oxford', 'English', 'professor', 'dead', 'home', 'video', 'submitted', 'dating', 'web', 'site', 'was', 'pirated', 'see', 'site', 'called', 'Barker', 'suicide', 'Professor', 'Miranda', 'Thornton', 'Julie', 'Cox', 'had', 'painkillers', 'stomach', 'Lewis', 'Hathaway', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'cassette', 'tape', 'antiquated', 'answering', 'machine', 'missing', 'Investigations', 'lead', 'web', 'relationships', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'Thornton', 'was', 'school', 'Kit', 'Renton', 'Daniel', 'Lapaine', 'owner', 'Barker', 'web', 'site', 'was', 'school', 'was', 'Susanna', 'Leland', 'Kate', 'Maravan', 'owner', 'dating', 'site', 'video', 'was', 'posted', 'David', 'Connelly', 'Toby', 'Stephens', 'real', 'estate', 'developer', 'whom', 'Thornton', 'was', 'doing', 'battle.All', 'roads', 'lead', 'oddly', 'research', 'lab', 'simian', 'neuroscience', 'Fearful', 'Symmetry', 'When', 'Nick', 'Ciar', 'aacute', 'McMenamin', 'Honey', 'Addams', 'Georgia', 'Taylor', 'return', 'home', 'party', 'find', 'babysitter', 'Jessica', 'Lake', 'Abigail', 'Hardingham', 'dead', 'bound', 'bed', 'fetishistic', 'pose', 'Jessica', 'had', 'been', 'filling', 'friend', 'Yasmin', 'Randall', 'Leila', 'Mimmack', 'who', 'lab', 'tutelage', 'Dr.', 'Joshua', 'Ezrin', 'Gregor', 'Truter', 'Dr.', 'Bob', 'Massey', 'Con', ""O'Neill"", 'father', 'Jessica', 'boyfriend', 'Gideon', 'Pierro', 'Niel-Mee', 'art', 'photos', 'taken', 'controversial', 'anthropologist', 'social', 'pundit', 'Marion', 'Hammond', 'Lucy', 'Cohu', 'depicting', 'Jessica', 'similar', 'pose', 'one', 'was', 'found', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'clue', 'identity', 'killer', 'Indelible', 'Stain', 'also', 'back', 'events', 'Oxford', 'decades', 'ago', 'Dr.', 'Paul', 'Yelland', 'David', 'Soul', 'controversial', 'lecture', 'new', 'theory', 'criminal', 'dangerousness', 'later', 'found', 'dead', 'room', 'Ch', 'Supt', 'Innocent', 'detectives', 'wrap', 'case', 'up', 'quickly', 'department', 'had', 'declined', 'provide', 'Yelland', 'security', 'Initially', 'protesters', 'who', 'crashed', 'professor', 'lecture', 'are', 'suspect', 'criminologist', 'who', 'invited', 'Prof.', 'Anne', 'Rand', 'Nancy', 'Carroll', 'was', 'cruelly', 'using', 'husband', 'Robert', 'Fraser', 'Patrick', 'Baladi', 'having', 'affair', 'accomplished', 'student', 'Nina', 'Clemens', 'Pippa', 'Bennet', 'Warner', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'motive', 'murder', 'administrator', 'Lillian', 'Hunter', 'Nina', 'Sosanya', 'connection', 'Yelland', 'long', 'ago']",N/A

1537869,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B007T40F14,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","Kevin Whately, the consummate actor who portrayed Chief Inspector Morse's (John Thaw) long-suffering Detective Sergeant Lewis on ""Inspector Morse"" plays Detective Inspector Lewis in ""Inspector Lewis"", a riveting investigative drama set in the academic town of Oxford, England.Having watched all of the Inspector Morse episodes, I can see the evolution of Lewis' character (brilliantly portrayed by Kevin Whately) from a diligent albeit lowly sergeant under the guidance of the amazing Chief Inspector Morse (John Thaw) to a confident, outspoken, yet still down to earth DI who now has his own underling in the form of the intellectual, gifted Cambridge-educated DS Hathaway (Lawrence Fox).Over the course of several seasons, viewers are able to see the close rapport that develops between Lewis and Hathaway who is most loyal to his DI. The scenic setting of the university town of Oxford adds to sense of atmosphere and the beautiful score and cinematography make this series a delightful viewing experience.Season 5 has not lost the magic of the previous seasons. In ""The Soul of Genius"", a young and attractive botanist discovers the body of an Oxford Professor buried on the grounds of a park. Lewis and Hathaway investigate and discover that the professor had been utterly obsessed over Lewis Carroll's nonsense poem The Hunting of the Snark and had owned a rare manuscript of the original work. This bewilders Lewis and Hathaway since the Professor did not possess the financial means to purchase such a valuable manuscript. As the pair digs deeper, they come up with a whole list of potential suspects - the brother of the dead professor (both were in bitter rivalry with each other), the female head of the botanical gardens (played by Celia Imrie of Cranford) who appears to be concealing something, a married professor who studies plants and who is also having an affair with the head of the gardens, and two enigmatic undergraduates who are into mind games and trying desperately to get into The Wednesday Club, a famed club for the truly gifted.I enjoyed ""The Soul of a Genius"" because I was drawn into the whole Snark business and was wondering throughout how this tied in with the case, though I was a little disappointed with how it all ended. Lewis and Hathaway deliver compelling performances as always and I can never seem to get enough of Lewis' dry humor and Hathaway's deadpan intellectualism.In ""Generation of Vipers"", a lonely English professor, Miranda Thornton is found dead in her home by a student. Though it appears to be suicide, Lewis and Hathaway suspect there's more to her death. They discover that Miranda had been the sole opposition to a development project funded by a millionaire property developer (played by Jane Eyre's Toby Stephen). Also, Miranda had placed an ad on an internet dating site which had gone viral and could have caused her much embarrassment. This is my second favorite episode of this season as I found it to be well-plotted with a couple of red herrings that made me suspect the wrong person, only to find it all coming together towards the end. This episode deals with rivalry, jealousy, resentments that go back decades, and a tragic love affair - themes that guarantee a stellar episode!""Fearful Symmetry"" opens with a young couple leaving their young son in the care of an 18-year-old babysitter, Jessica. They return the next morning and find the babysitter dead. Lewis and Hathaway's investigation uncovers the fact that Jessica used to be in foster care. Her boyfriend appears to be genuinely saddened by her death, but his mother disliked her intensely. Then the detectives discover Jessica modeled for a series of provocative photographs for a well-known female photographer, Marion Hammond. Could this be linked to her murder? This episode was well set-up to the point that when the identity of the killer was finally revealed, it caught me by surprise.In ""The Indelible Stain"", an American professor, Yelland (played by David Soul) delivers a guest lecture at the invitation of the Oxford Criminology Department. His ideas on criminal dangerousness, which are perceived as racist, come under attack and later when he is found strangled, Lewis and Hathaway find themselves trying to clue in on the possible motives, and are perturbed to find that there could be several suspects ranging from two old ladies who were conned into buying a fake antique vase by Yelland, an ambitious Oxford professor whose husband is having an affair with a student, and many others. The themes of ambition, politics, and revenge are masterfully woven into the plot. This is my favorite episode this season, and how could I not love an episode where Dickens' immortal words from A Tale of Two Cities come to feature so prominently in the plot? The episode ends on a bittersweet note, a perfect ending for another wonderful season.The close bond between Lewis and Hathaway is evident here, and the two men banter their way through the cases, part of what makes this show such an engaging watch. I will never tire of watching Lewis marvel at Hathaway's grasp of minute details, most of which are beyond his own understanding (after all Hathaway is the Cambridge educated man) but then Hathaway is equally impressed by Lewis' astuteness and deep understanding of human nature. Together both men are able to solve the most baffling crimes and I await the next season with great anticipation. If only they made more episodes per season.",5,An amazingly well-written and well-acted investigative series,1351468800,"10 29, 2012",2012,5480,"['Kevin', 'Whately', 'consummate', 'actor', 'who',
