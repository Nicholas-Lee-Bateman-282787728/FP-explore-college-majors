This lull of time that passed as the show established its new home on the Lifetime network put me thru major PROJECT RUNWAY withdrawal and so I purchased all 5 previous seasons on dvd.  What a treat.  Any show is more enjoyable on dvd without commercials and editing.  To watch the show from the first episode till the last without any interruptions allowed me to gain even more from this season than before.  I love all the seasons but found this one to be the best.  I thought this was the season with the most talented fashion designers and the season leads to a final three all deserving to be showing their line at fashion week.The show is always adhesively held together thru the charm and wit of Heidi Klum and the show could not exist without the heart and guidance of Tim Gunn.  And judges Nina Garcia and Michael Kors always have honest, valuable opinions as each projects designs are shown on the runway.  The unique thing about PROJECT RUNWAY is that all the contestants are people seriously pursuing a career in fashion with intense drive and the judges are all experts in the field as is Tim Gunn.  The drama that unfolds on the show is not manuipulated but merely due to the fact that while having these contestants do challenge after challenge and get eliminated one by one they form relationships and we get to care about these people.  Watching it unedited with no commercials I found this season to make me root for people I didn't particularly care for when I previously watched this season.This show truly gets under your skin and is very addictive.  There is talent here and just by being what it is the show provides huge entertainment.  I can watch each season over and over even though I know the outcome.  There is a class and sincerity that rises this show above other reality shows out there.  And to watch contestants wear their hearts on their sleeve as they pursue their dreams to be big fashion designers is a gift.  I can't say enough about this show and this season in particular.  This season on dvd was short on extras.  There is a short profile on the winner after the season ended but I am fine with the lack of extras.  I would have loved blooper reels and even more of a history on each contestant but all of this really is a part of the show anyways.  So I give this dvd a A++++++ but do say realize you aren't getting any extras.  If you are ok with that you will be in PROJECT RUNWAY heaven.",5,The best reality show,1252972800,"09 15, 2009",2009,2507,"['absolutely', 'LOVE', 'show', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'started', 'lull', 'time', 'passed', 'show', 'established', 'new', 'home', 'Lifetime', 'network', 'put', 'major', 'PROJECT', 'RUNWAY', 'withdrawal', 'so', 'purchased', '5', 'previous', 'seasons', 'dvd', 'What', 'treat', 'show', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'dvd', 'commercials', 'editing', 'watch', 'show', 'first', 'episode', 'last', 'interruptions', 'allowed', 'gain', 'even', 'more', 'season', 'love', 'seasons', 'found', 'one', 'be', 'best', 'thought', 'was', 'season', 'most', 'talented', 'fashion', 'designers', 'season', 'final', 'three', 'deserving', 'be', 'showing', 'line', 'fashion', 'week.The', 'show', 'always', 'adhesively', 'held', 'together', 'thru', 'charm', 'wit', 'Heidi', 'Klum', 'show', 'could', 'not', 'exist', 'heart', 'guidance', 'Tim', 'Gunn', 'judges', 'Nina', 'Garcia', 'Michael', 'Kors', 'always', 'have', 'honest', 'valuable', 'opinions', 'projects', 'designs', 'are', 'shown', 'runway', 'unique', 'thing', 'PROJECT', 'RUNWAY', 'contestants', 'are', 'people', 'seriously', 'pursuing', 'career', 'fashion', 'intense', 'drive', 'judges', 'are', 'experts', 'field', 'Tim', 'Gunn', 'drama', 'show', 'not', 'manuipulated', 'merely', 'due', 'fact', 'having', 'contestants', 'do', 'challenge', 'challenge', 'get', 'eliminated', 'one', 'one', 'form', 'relationships', 'get', 'care', 'people', 'Watching', 'unedited', 'commercials', 'found', 'season', 'make', 'root', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'when', 'previously', 'watched', 'season.This', 'show', 'truly', 'skin', 'very', 'addictive', 'talent', 'here', 'just', 'being', 'what', 'show', 'huge', 'entertainment', 'can', 'watch', 'season', 'even', 'know', 'outcome', 'class', 'sincerity', 'show', 'other', 'reality', 'out', 'there', 'watch', 'contestants', 'wear', 'hearts', 'sleeve', 'pursue', 'dreams', 'be', 'big', 'fashion', 'designers', 'gift', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'show', 'season', 'particular', 'season', 'dvd', 'was', 'short', 'extras', 'short', 'profile', 'winner', 'season', 'ended', 'am', 'fine', 'lack', 'extras', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'blooper', 'reels', 'even', 'more', 'history', 'contestant', 'really', 'part', 'show', 'give', 'dvd', 'A++++++', 'do', 'say', 'realize', 'are', ""n't"", 'getting', 'extras', 'are', 'ok', 'will', 'be', 'PROJECT', 'RUNWAY', 'heaven']",Project Runway: Season 4
1181641,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B001DJ7PXM,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[1, 1]","I've picked out this season of PROJECT RUNWAY to review because this season produced the most talented designer of any season of the show, Christian Siriano. He also happened to be the most interesting character. He is a slight figure of a young man who can and does try on his own clothes and models them (to great comic effect) plus has great expressions such as ""Fierce"" when he really likes something.  Also, he is likable, which is something that can't be said usually about most of the contestants.  He ran away with the viewers' prize of their most favorite character on the show.  No one else even came close.  His clothes are breathtaking.  Even Victoria Beckham was moved to say that she would wear every single one of his outfits. If you have never watched this show before, try this season, it is the standout because of Christian Siriano.",5,"Christian Siriano, the Best Contestant Ever",1251849600,"09 2, 2009",2009,851,"[""'ve"", 'picked', 'out', 'season', 'PROJECT', 'RUNWAY', 'review', 'season', 'produced', 'most', 'talented', 'designer', 'season', 'show', 'Christian', 'Siriano', 'also', 'happened', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'slight', 'figure', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'try', 'own', 'clothes', 'models', 'great', 'comic', 'effect', 'great', 'expressions', 'such', 'Fierce', 'when', 'really', 'something', 'Also', 'likable', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'usually', 'most', 'contestants', 'ran', 'away', 'viewers', 'prize', 'most', 'favorite', 'character', 'show', 'one', 'else', 'even', 'came', 'close', 'clothes', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'Even', 'Victoria', 'Beckham', 'was', 'moved', 'say', 'would', 'wear', 'single', 'one', 'outfits', 'have', 'never', 'watched', 'show', 'try', 'season', 'standout', 'Christian', 'Siriano']",Project Runway: Season 4

1181644,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B001DJ7PXM,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[8, 10]","Season Four of ""Project Runway"" starts out slow, but it builds up steam and draws you in... the show is still a high-class production and leaves other ""reality"" shows in the dust.Early on, Tim Gunn pronounces this season's ensemble to be the most talented group they've had on yet... but it's a little hard to believe him since the cast lacks the dynamism and sharply defined personalities of earlier seasons. Nevertheless, a couple of designers quickly reveal themselves as unlikable or bizarre, and that always adds a little narrative spice. I would say that this season was largely packed with bland personalities, but once they drop out in the first half, the show gets more exciting, and when it becomes clear that one of the most irritating contestants has a pretty good shot at winning, the subsequent eliminations will get your adrenaline going.This season was also marked by constant one-upping on the part of Heidi Klum and the producers -- almost every episode has a twist or a Big Secret. Sure, it's gimmicky... but so what?  It's also fun! Perhaps the greatest thing this season is Heidi's new wardrobe -- after being pregnant and having her baby during previous seasons, she's now trimmed back down and is again able to wear whatever she wants. One of the great joys of this season is to watch the reactions of the contestants as Klum arrives on the runway in one eye-popping outfit after another.Great show.  Looking forward to Season Five!

1181647,A2Q543TN0328O1,B001DJ7PXM,"Ramona ""Author of Dynamic Belly Dance""","[0, 0]","I have a lot of sewing experience, but have no time to watch TV, so I've never watched the Project Runway show until receiving this DVD as a Christmas gift. I'd heard of Project Runway from seeing sewing-related merchandise at the fabric stores, but didn't know what it was about until some sewing club members told me how much they loved this TV show. I got hooked from the first episode---this is really entertaining!The show starts with 15 contestants who design and sew clothing for various assigned tasks----menswear, 2-piece ladies' outfit, etc, (one task per episode). The garments are modeled in a runway show and judged at the end of each episode. The number of contestants gradually dwindles at the end of each episode, when he/she who gets the lowest score for a garment is released from competition.This show has laugh out loud moments. For those who sew, you'll get a laugh out of the contestant whose fellow teammate is exasperated and describes her as being from another planet---she has a ""unique"" approach to sewing. She is a nature spirit, into yoga, and she spit-marks her fabric, and her teammate has to explain to her that using pins is more accurate (and cleaner)! Unbelievable! I have to say, she's one of my favorites, and I like the way she uses the floor as a cutting board.This show is filmed in such a personal way---you learn about each contestant, a little of their life, ambition, why they're attracted to fashion, their day jobs---these personal things really make you pick out favorites.If you do a lot of sewing, you'll appreciate learning how these designers approach the tasks. Some of the contestants are obviously more experienced with sewing and tailoring, and if you sew you'll appreciate seeing them working hard at creating their garments. Some of the garments are absolutely lovely, and some are disasters. Those who sew will appreciate the sewing successes as well as the sewing mishaps.One thing that I noticed and appreciated about the judging of the finished garments was that shoddy sewing was recognized by the judges, and that the contestant with the lowest score generally had the worst sewing. It's nice to know that good sewing skills are rewarded. On the other hand, you really have to sympathise with these contestants being under tight deadlines and scrambling to get their garments finished while running out of time. Some of the contestants are obviously skilled with sewing, and some seem to be gifted at drawing designs but lacking in sewing skills.Sometimes celebrities are featured to assign tasks and to judge the finished garments (such as a former athlete/ news anchor who assigned a task of creating menswear suitable for a TV news host). Personally, I thought the contestants were far more interesting than the celebrities. I do not have time to watch TV, so I'd never heard of the celebrities on this show---one was an actress from Sex and the City. It is good that the narrarator/mentor/announcer tells us who the celebrity is and why he/she is famous.Tell your sewing buddies about this DVD, it's great!",5,"If you love sewing, you'll love this DVD!",1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,3073,"['have', 'lot', 'sewing', 'experience', 'have', 'time', 'watch', 'TV', ""'ve"", 'never', 'watched', 'Project', 'Runway', 'show', 'receiving', 'DVD', 'Christmas', 'gift', ""'d"", 'heard', 'Project', 'Runway', 'seeing', 'sewing-related', 'merchandise', 'fabric', 'stores', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'sewing', 'club', 'members', 'told', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'TV', 'show', 'got', 'hooked', 'first', 'episode', '-this', 'really', 'entertaining', 'show', '15', 'contestants', 'who', 'design', 'sew', 'clothing', 'various', 'assigned', 'tasks', 'menswear', '2-piece', 'ladies', 'outfit', 'etc', 'one', 'task', 'episode', 'garments', 'are', 'modeled', 'runway', 'show', 'judged', 'end', 'episode', 'number', 'contestants', 'gradually', 'end', 'episode', 'when', 'he/she', 'who', 'lowest', 'score', 'garment', 'released', 'competition.This', 'show', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'moments', 'who', 'sew', ""'ll"", 'get', 'laugh', 'contestant', 'fellow', 'teammate', 'exasperated', 'being', 'planet', '-she', 'unique', 'approach', 'sewing', 'nature', 'spirit', 'yoga', 'fabric', 'teammate', 'explain', 'using', 'pins', 'more', 'accurate', 'cleaner', 'Unbelievable', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'favorites', 'like', 'way', 'floor', 'cutting', 'board.This', 'show', 'filmed', 'such', 'personal', 'way', '-you', 'learn', 'contestant', 'little', 'life', 'ambition', 'why', ""'re"", 'attracted', 'fashion', 'day', 'jobs', '-these', 'personal', 'things', 'really', 'make', 'pick', 'out', 'favorites.If', 'do', 'lot', 'sewing', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'learning', 'how', 'designers', 'approach', 'tasks', 'contestants', 'are', 'obviously', 'more', 'experienced', 'sewing', 'tailoring', 'sew', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'seeing', 'working', 'hard', 'creating', 'garments', 'garments', 'are', 'absolutely', 'lovely', 'are', 'disasters', 'who', 'sew', 'will', 'appreciate', 'sewing', 'as', 'well', 'sewing', 'mishaps.One', 'thing', 'noticed', 'appreciated', 'judging', 'finished', 'garments', 'was', 'shoddy', 'sewing', 'was', 'recognized', 'judges', 'contestant', 'lowest', 'score', 'generally', 'had', 'worst', 'sewing', 'nice', 'know', 'good', 'sewing', 'skills', 'are', 'rewarded', 'other', 'hand', 'really', 'have', 'sympathise', 'contestants', 'being', 'tight', 'deadlines', 'scrambling', 'get', 'garments', 'finished', 'running', 'time', 'contestants', 'are', 'obviously', 'skilled', 'sewing', 'seem', 'be', 'gifted', 'drawing', 'designs', 'lacking', 'sewing', 'skills.Sometimes', 'celebrities', 'are', 'featured', 'assign', 'tasks', 'judge', 'finished', 'garments', 'such', 'former', 'athlete/', 'news', 'anchor', 'who', 'assigned', 'task', 'creating', 'menswear', 'suitable', 'TV', 'news', 'host', 'Personally', 'thought', 'contestants', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'celebrities', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'time', 'watch', 'TV', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'celebrities', 'show', '-one', 'was', 'actress', 'Sex', 'City', 'good', 'narrarator/mentor/announcer', 'who', 'celebrity', 'why', 'he/she', 'famous.Tell', 'sewing', 'buddies', 'DVD', 'great']",Project Runway: Season 4
