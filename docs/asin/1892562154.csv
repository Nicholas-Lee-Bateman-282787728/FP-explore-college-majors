Here is a man who was also a gifted virtuoso in the classic repetoire who brought 75 years of his long life as an entertainer with a sharp wit that was and still is captivating! I now have all the Victor Borge DVD's but this one singles out one performance with doses of his classic [no pun intended] routines yet coming from Borge and his marvelous manner of delivery, they endure their retread status as it were. And the crowd duly verifies both the fun and the laughs! Mightily!Even his ad hoc interaction with the audience is taken very well and one can see that the audience literally loved the guy! In one case in this DVD, a woman has a rather audible yet distinctive laugh akin to a clucking chicken and after hearing same for more than a few times, Victor comments, ""Pardon me, Madam, are you laying eggs?""All the routines are present in this one live performance including the famous Borge ""phonetic punctuation"" thing and related Borge signature skits and laughs a la mode. Check out the other available Victor Borge DVD's as well!Non-stop fun but unique to the Victor Borge personality ... and talent!  I'll leave you with one of his end-of-performance quips which generally brought on roars from the crowd, to wit, ""I wish to thank my parents for  having made this evening possible [pauses ...] and my children for having made it necessary."" Neggie-Neggie! [sic]. If you know 'that' one from the ""instant Japanese language"" routine, you know Victor Borge!

195513,A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD,1892562154,"Heath Buckmaster ""_heath_""","[0, 1]","I remember listening to Victor Borge as a child on my parents LP player. I just couldn't get over the laughter from things as simple as Phonetic Punctuation. Although there is nothing simple about his comedy. It's well practiced, provoking, and timeless. There's nothing better (to me) about comedy so good that it takes the audience an extra moment to get it.When I think about the great comics I tend to start with Eddie Izzard. The intelligence behind his routines amazes me, and I thought that I had never seen another comedian before who possessed that level of wit, until I actually saw the video recordings from Victor Borge. It became evident that many comedians have certainly looked to Borge as a mentor of comic delivery.The Best of Victor Borge is one of those video presentations that contains Act One and Two of his classic routines in a live performance. Although the theatre and clothing of the attendees is dated the material is as fresh then (early 90's) as it was when I watched the DVD a month ago, and again last week.This DVD contains some of the absolute best routines from Borge: Marylyn Mulvey delivering a stunning Aria, The Timid Page Turner (with a cameo from one of Borge's sons), Phonetic Punctuation, Inflationary Language, 2nd Rhapsody by Fliszt, and many other musical numbers. Borge is able to seamlessly blend comedy and music into a really enjoyable concert experience.The master of the ""strategic pause"" (reference: [...]) makes us laugh with something as simple as reminding the opera singer to stop touching the piano over and over again, or letting us know that since children are in the audience he won't be able to do the second act in the nude - but instead requests ""a tie...the long one.""There are many Borge collections - this one contains what you will probably remember as his greatest. It is appropriate for all ages, and you and your kids will put this one back in the player over and over again, and laugh just as hard the second, third, or fortieth time :-).Cheers!",5,Timeless comedy from the amazing and twoderful Victor Borge,1229904000,"12 22, 2008",2008,2017,"['remember', 'listening', 'Victor', 'Borge', 'child', 'parents', 'LP', 'player', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'laughter', 'things', 'as', 'simple', 'Phonetic', 'Punctuation', 'nothing', 'simple', 'comedy', 'well', 'practiced', 'provoking', 'timeless', 'nothing', 'better', 'comedy', 'so', 'good', 'audience', 'extra', 'moment', 'get', 'it.When', 'think', 'great', 'comics', 'tend', 'start', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'intelligence', 'routines', 'thought', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'comedian', 'who', 'possessed', 'level', 'wit', 'actually', 'saw', 'video', 'recordings', 'Victor', 'Borge', 'became', 'evident', 'many', 'comedians', 'have', 'certainly', 'looked', 'Borge', 'mentor', 'comic', 'delivery.The', 'Best', 'Victor', 'Borge', 'one', 'video', 'presentations', 'Act', 'One', 'Two', 'classic', 'routines', 'live', 'performance', 'theatre', 'clothing', 'attendees', 'dated', 'material', 'fresh', 'then', 'early', '90', 'was', 'when', 'watched', 'DVD', 'month', 'ago', 'again', 'last', 'week.This', 'DVD', 'absolute', 'best', 'routines', 'Borge', 'Marylyn', 'Mulvey', 'delivering', 'stunning', 'Aria', 'Timid', 'Page', 'Turner', 'cameo', 'one', 'Borge', 'sons', 'Phonetic', 'Punctuation', 'Inflationary', 'Language', '2nd', 'Rhapsody', 'Fliszt', 'many', 'other', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Borge', 'able', 'seamlessly', 'blend', 'comedy', 'music', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'concert', 'experience.The', 'master', 'strategic', 'pause', 'reference', '[', ']', 'something', 'as', 'simple', 'reminding', 'opera', 'singer', 'stop', 'touching', 'piano', 'over', 'again', 'letting', 'know', 'children', 'are', 'audience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'do', 'second', 'act', 'nude', 'instead', 'tie', 'long', 'one', 'are', 'many', 'Borge', 'collections', 'one', 'what', 'will', 'probably', 'remember', 'greatest', 'appropriate', 'ages', 'kids', 'will', 'put', 'one', 'back', 'player', 'over', 'again', 'laugh', 'just', 'as', 'hard', 'second', 'third', 'fortieth', 'time', '.Cheers']",N/A
195514,A27VMEB55OY9LS,1892562154,Kathy-W,"[1, 1]","First of all, the title puzzles me because this is actually *not* a total clip show like some others out there - it is basically just a Victor Borge concert, and that's how I like it. No stupid narration or pointless black-and-white photo portraits, no interviews with fellow musicians or any other time fillers. This is Victor Borge on the stage and up to his antics. Some people complain that portions are edited out, but my Borge DVD collection is starting to get big and I can safely say that the editing on this item was still done with a MUCH lighter hand than some others out there.As to the picture/sound quality, I don't know if that's the fault of the DVD. If they originally filmed with subpar equipment (not uncommon in ""live"" settings), it's only going to be so good when you put it onto a DVD. I'm not saying they couldn't have improved the film a little more, but film is only as good as the original quality. You can't turn a decaying, scraped-up wax cylinder into a sparkling 21st-century mp3, and you can't make medium-quality film look like a high definition Blu-Ray. I'm not defending the editing/production guys, I'm just explaining that technology can't do EVERYTHING when your source material wasn't a perfect quality.That aside, I do really enjoy this DVD heads above some of my other Borge programs. For one thing, as I already mentioned, this one doesn't have stuffy narration. Borge just comes out on the stage, starts his schtick, and keeps on going. Yes, the skits themselves will be familiar to the uber-fans out there, but they were executed with gusto here. The Salieri opera cracks my parents up every time, and having sung classical music myself, the gentle but unflinching musical humor usually makes me laugh sideways. The ""Rigoletto"" skit is likewise very dear to my heart.When Borge finally gets down to business on the piano, he plays a very lovely ""Claire de Lune"" and a charming Danish lullaby.There is no one perfect Victor Borge DVD, but this is better than some of the others out there.",4,"Hear me out, this one has longer clips than many other Borge products!",1372550400,"06 30, 2013",2013,2030,"['First', 'all', 'title', 'actually', '*not*', 'total', 'clip', 'show', 'others', 'there', 'basically', 'just', 'Victor', 'Borge', 'concert', 'how', 'like', 'stupid', 'narration', 'pointless', 'black-and-white', 'photo', 'portraits', 'interviews', 'fellow', 'musicians', 'other', 'time', 'fillers', 'Victor', 'Borge', 'stage', 'up', 'antics', 'people', 'complain', 'portions', 'are', 'edited', 'out', 'Borge', 'DVD', 'collection', 'starting', 'get', 'big', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'editing', 'item', 'was', 'still', 'done', 'MUCH', 'lighter', 'hand', 'others', 'out', 'there.As', 'picture/sound', 'quality', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'fault', 'DVD', 'originally', 'filmed', 'subpar', 'equipment', 'not', 'uncommon', 'live', 'settings', 'only', 'going', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'when', 'put', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'improved', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'film', 'only', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'quality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'turn', 'decaying', 'scraped-up', 'wax', 'cylinder', 'sparkling', '21st-century', 'mp3', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'medium-quality', 'film', 'look', 'high', 'definition', 'Blu-Ray', ""'m"", 'not', 'defending', 'editing/production', 'guys', ""'m"", 'just', 'explaining', 'technology', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'EVERYTHING', 'when', 'source', 'material', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'aside', 'do', 'really', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'heads', 'other', 'Borge', 'programs', 'one', 'thing', 'already', 'mentioned', 'one', ""n't"", 'have', 'stuffy', 'narration', 'Borge', 'just', 'out', 'stage', 'schtick', 'going', 'Yes', 'skits', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'uber-fans', 'there', 'were', 'executed', 'gusto', 'here', 'Salieri', 'opera', 'cracks', 'parents', 'time', 'having', 'sung', 'classical', 'music', 'gentle', 'unflinching', 'musical', 'humor', 'usually', 'laugh', 'sideways', 'Rigoletto', 'skit', 'likewise', 'very', 'dear', 'heart.When', 'Borge', 'finally', 'down', 'business', 'piano', 'very', 'lovely', 'Claire', 'de', 'Lune', 'charming', 'Danish', 'one', 'perfect', 'Victor', 'Borge', 'DVD', 'better', 'others', 'there']",N/A
195515,A2M1B750OV0PXR,1892562154,"""maelstrom1""","[165, 165]","Many years ago I saw a television special starring Victor Borge. At the time, I had little knowledge of classical music and I did not really find it interesting. Nowadays, however, I listen to classical music all the time  and I am able to appreciate the jokes, so I recently watched this video of  Borge in concert.First off, Victor Borge is a very funny man. Not only  are his facial expressions and body language humourous, but his witty  remarks and plays on words show the true, spirited nature of his character.  Secondly, he is a very talented pianist. This is especially apparent during  the last 15 to 20 minutes of the video where he plays a series of waltzes  and lullabies. It is easy to see why he was a top-notch performer back in  the 1930s -- and he still is to this very day.The live concert on this  video contains many of his classic routines. Some of the musical comedies  include the Salieri Opera (which I have also seen listed as A Mozart Opera  -- same routine), the 2nd Rhapsody by &quot;Fliszt&quot;, and his  accompaniment to Marylyn Mulvey during an aria. Equally funny are some of  his non-musical comedy routines, including Inflationary Language and  Phonetic Punctuation [sput]. These acts are even funnier when viewed on  video than when I first listened to them on CD. The video has enough  routines to keep you in stitches for at least an hour after it's over.Overall, I highly recommend this video to anyone who has and has not  witnessed the comedy in music of Victor Borge.

195518,A6FIAB28IS79,1892562154,Samuel Chell,"[13, 17]","The 2 funniest comedian-musicians of the 20th century were Victor Borge and Danny Kaye.  Whereas the former relied heavily on understatement--teasing the viewer with the expectation of a performance that never seems to unfold, the latter was so free in sharing his prodigious talent that he risked being taken for granted.  The common denominator between the two entertainers was a love of language, a penchant for word play and a delight in exposing the inconsistencies of the grammatical-semantic properties of English.Borge is at his best when he applies his facility with languages to the language of music.  But comedy &quot;in&quot; music as opposed to comedy &quot;about&quot; music requires a relatively sophisticated, knowledgeable audience.  As time went on, Borge relied more and more on visual humor, slapstick and &quot;dumb&quot; jokes, as is documented by this video recording of a concert late in his career in Minneapolis.  And as dumb as it frequently can be, the humor succeeds because of Borge's persona.  We know he's a polished, graceful pianist, that he has intellectual pedigree,  and we sense an air of aristocratic gentility not to mention cosmopolitan urbanity.  Consequently, if he can reduce himself to some of this material, we sense that we're &quot;released&quot; to enjoy it fully even if occasionally &quot;in spite of ourselves&quot;In sum, this tape nicely represents late Borge, but it's only one performance, and to call it the &quot;best&quot; is misleading.",4,"Not quite the best, but it'll do.",992908800,"06 19, 2001",2001,1497,"['2', 'funniest', 'comedian-musicians', '20th', 'century', 'were', 'Victor', 'Borge', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'former', 'relied', 'heavily', 'understatement', 'teasing', 'viewer', 'expectation', 'performance', 'never', 'unfold', 'latter', 'was', 'so', 'free', 'sharing', 'prodigious', 'talent', 'risked', 'being', 'taken', 'granted', 'common', 'denominator', 'two', 'entertainers', 'was', 'love', 'language', 'penchant', 'word', 'play', 'delight', 'exposing', 'inconsistencies', 'grammatical-semantic', 'properties', 'English.Borge', 'best', 'when', 'facility', 'languages', 'language', 'music', 'comedy', 'quot', 'quot', 'music', 'opposed', 'comedy', 'quot', 'quot', 'music', 'relatively', 'sophisticated', 'knowledgeable', 'audience', 'time', 'went', 'Borge', 'relied', 'more', 'more', 'visual', 'humor', 'slapstick', 'quot', 'quot', 'jokes', 'documented', 'video', 'recording', 'concert', 'late', 'career', 'Minneapolis', 'as', 'dumb', 'frequently', 'can', 'be', 'humor', 'Borge', 'persona', 'know', 'polished', 'graceful', 'pianist', 'intellectual', 'pedigree', 'sense', 'air', 'aristocratic', 'gentility', 'not', 'mention', 'cosmopolitan', 'urbanity', 'Consequently', 'can', 'reduce', 'material', 'sense', ""'re"", 'quot', 'released', 'quot', 'enjoy', 'fully', 'even', 'occasionally', 'quot', 'spite', 'quot', 'sum', 'tape', 'nicely', 'late', 'Borge', 'only', 'one', 'performance', 'call', 'quot', 'best', 'quot', 'misleading']",N/A
