443825,A3P876I6K3KL8V,6305009589,C. Long,"[2, 2]","I can't believe it!  I've actually found a movie that I actually enjoyed MORE than the book.  I would watch this movie any day over reading the book and I can't think of any other books with movie adaptations I would say that about.So you know where I'm coming from:- I previously have read and watched ""Where the Red Fern Grows"" which was another book written by the author of this one. In that case, both movie attempts were notably worse than the book (esp. the Disney remake from a few years back)- I watched this movie first before reading the book.  I enjoyed the movie as a movie in its own right and thought: ""Wow! If the movie is this good, the book must be STELLAR!  So I ordered the book and read it and I felt ""let down"".  By the time I was done with the book, I had already forgotten much of how the movie compared with the book, so I re-watched the movie within a day of finishing the book and am now writing this review after having just finished the movie again.  My point is that both book and movie are very fresh in my mind right now as I write this review.Now let's get down to business:First, for the movie they changed things that really needed to be changed in order to bring it to a movie format - esp. for a movie made in modern times.  So instead of 29 monkeys with 1 chimp as the leader (30 total) in the book, we get 4 chimps for the movie. Presumably they used chimps instead of monkeys because they are easier to train/work with for movies, so that doesn't bother me.Instead of the boy wanting a pony and a gun really bad in the book, he only really wants the pony in the movie.  A perfectly understandable decision for modern family movie-going audiences.In the book, there's a major part where the boy (Jay Berry) and his dog ""mistakenly"" get drunk along with the monkeys and the boy loses his pants through the process (and subsequently spends days recovering in bed from his drunkenness).  In the movie, only the monkeys get drunk.  Again, while it is somewhat entertaining in the book, I believe changing this was an appropriate decision for the movie.The book is ""grittier"" - the boy is more rugged, the sister is more of a pain/pest, the mother is more hardened, etc. There's much more antagonism in the book between the boy and his mother/sister (and actually girls in general) than appears in the movie.In the movie, all the characters seem much more ""balanced"" to me.  The boy is not so rugged as to be a put-off to modern audiences.  This sister is more endearing and easier to relate to (this is important given the final scenes).  The mother, while still a concerned mother, is ""softer"" which I greatly appreciated because she's also big on teaching the Bible and in the book, it just came across wrong to me as a Christian - she was portrayed too harshly in the book.  The father and grandfather both are portrayed less aloof and as having more wisdom in the movie.  Again, everyone's just a bit more ""balanced"" in the movie.The basic ""heart"" of the book is in tact in the movie, but I believe that it actually does a better job of getting that ""heart"" across than the book does - in other words it ""amplifies"" the messages/heart of the book.  The movie takes numerous liberties - even adding several other characters and scenes - but it mostly serves to help draw out that ""heart"" rather than take away from it.  I even enjoyed the ending better in the movie than in the book!Now the biggest reason I prefer the movie.  As a Christian, the book bothered me a bit.  There is a great emphasis on a character ""The Old Man of the Mountains"" as well as a magic fairy ring, which grants magical wishes.  While there is a vague tie-in with God in both cases, it comes across much more as everyone got what they wanted based on wishing/hoping for it, rather than trusting God.  Basically the Christianity in the book is a very watered-down, folksy, liberal, superstitious, ""religious"" Christianity.  In the movie, while they kept the references to both (I actually wish they didn't), they're much toned-down and ""The Old Man of the Mountains"" is explicitly stated to be God watching out for the animals, and the ""magic fairy ring"" isn't described as such and only the sister gets in it and she is shown to be praying rather than just ""making a wish"".  With that said, there is 1 scene in the movie that along these lines bothered me a bit that WASN'T in the book.  There's a scene during a big storm where the mother is reading Psalm 23 from her Bible, which is nice, but just as she's talking about the peace of the Lord, etc. we see all the windows being blown out, etc.  It could easily be seen to be sending a message that God doesn't care at all and that the Bible isn't really a comfort, etc.  Almost like ""See what reading the Bible and believing in God gets you?  A bunch of broken stuff that will need to be repaired and cost you money.""  I don't think it likely that this was intended by the filmmakers - it just came across a bit that way.The book was quite amusing.  But even with all the changes in the movie (and there are quite a number), they still managed to generally keep that amusing quality - though definitely less in comparison.I do wish that they had provided some closure with the ""bully kids"" that they added for the movie.  The other thing that bothered me some was them killing off the other main character they added for the movie: the old moonshiner that ran the still.  The movie makes us feel something for him, and then kills him off.  On the other hand, the character was a great visual of how our choices affect our lives, and his death was a ""growing up"" experience for the boy (Jay Berry).Basically, in the final analysis, I felt they did a reasonably good job with this movie.  They left out various stuff from the book, but I believe most of those to have been very wise decisions.  Likewise, they changed things, but mostly seemed to only change stuff that needed to be changed to work in a movie format or to work with the locales, etc. that they had to work with.  And the stuff they added was stuff mostly necessary to help ""tie everything together"" and really ""make it work"" in a movie format - to add feeling/dimension, etc.All that to say, I doubt I'll ever read the book again.  But the movie I'm sure I'll watch for years to come.  I realize that's not ""politically correct"" to say for many, and I mean no disrespect to the author who certainly knew how to write a compelling book (i.e. ""Where the Red Fern Grows"") but in this case the movie was just plain ""more satisfying"".Note: My review is based on the non-Disney release of this - the ""Feature Films for Families"" version. I say that only because based on other reviews, there must be some scenes that are in the Disney release that aren't in what I saw (i.e. another reviewer mentioned a ""gruesome"" look at the dead body of the moonshiner - there is no such scene in what I saw - you just see the dead hand and then the scene ends). It is conceivable that the Disney version has other scenes as well that were cut out from the version I have, so keep that in mind as well.",5,Better than the Book!

443829,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6305009589,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[4, 6]","I liked this movie.  The movie is full of fun and lots of little lessons for young and old alike.  I only have one small complaint.  There are no monkeys in this movie.  Monkeys usually have long tails and the word excludes apes, including chimpanzees.  My complaint comes because too many people already think of gorillas, orangutans and chimpanzees as monkeys, and children should learn better.Jay Berry Lee (Cory Savier) is a young boy on the Great Plains just past the turn of the century.  Jay Berry has his heart set on a beautiful mare.  However, money is tight and Jay Berry quickly realizes that working Grandpa Sam Ferrans's (Wilford Brimley) store will not earn him money as fast as he would like.  Help comes in the form of a troop of chimpanzees.A circus train derailed near town, and now their owner is searching for them.  Jay Berry accidentally finds the chimps in the ""bottoms,"" where he is not supposed to go.  The bottoms are adjacent to a river, and the land is marshy and treacherous, and scary-looking moon shiner Bayliss Hatcher (Don Francks, a veteran of dozens of television and movie appearances) makes his home there.The movie alternates between the life that his parents, John Lee (Michael Ontkean, a veteran actor that has worked with Disney before) and Sara Lee (Leslie Hope, another veteran actor) think Jay Berry should prepare for, and the fantasies that Jay Berry seems to have.  Thrown into this mix is that Jay Berry's sister, Daisy Lee (Katie Stuart), is handicapped and relies on Jay Berry a lot.  Perhaps is would be more accurate to say that Jay Berry's parents rely on Jay Berry to watch over his younger sister.Through the movie, we watch as Jay Berry fights with himself over the meaning of right and wrong.  We watch Jay Berry get into situations that always seem to happen to us when we are young.  While we would like to save Jay Berry, we also know that Jay Berry must conquer these situations on his own in order to grow up.This movie does fall into the category of a ""coming of age"" movie.  However, the use of the chimpanzees as a tool to aid in that growing up and the era in which the movie make this movie an enjoyable experience.  I have watched this movie twice now.  The second time I watched it I appreciated it better than the first time, which I usually find to be a good sign.This movie was based on a book with the same title by Wilson Rawls.  However, I have not read the book.  Other reviewers have noted that the movie follows the book poorly, and have criticized the movie for its divergence.  If you have read the book and you think you might be disappointed if the movie departs significantly from the book, you may wish to pass this movie by.  If have not read the book and you like coming of age stories or family movies in general, then this movie will likely appeal to you.This movie has some stylistic similarities to the Wilderness Family movies of the mid to late 70s, and if you liked those movies you would probably like this movie.I think this movie is an excellent choice for a family film collection.  There are a few tense moments, but those moments are short and this movie should be fine for even the youngest members of the family.

The boy has some disapointments and sucesses and grows through these learning to put some sibling rivalry behind him as he becomes more selfless and devoted to others.

The heartwarming story takes place on a farm, a small town, and along a river sometime around 1920 or so, give or take a decade.
