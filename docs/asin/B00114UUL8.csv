1129695,A3LIWTQDSQ5UOO,B00114UUL8,"Jonathan Oyama ""Welcome to die!""","[2, 3]","""Eureka Seven"" is one of the most breathtaking mecha series, even if robot surfing seems a little too cheesy to take seriously.The sport in this series is called lifting, a form a airboarding. It's all the rage. The main character of ""Eureka Seven,"" 14-year-old Renton Thurston, is hell-bent on become a great lifter, just like his idol, Holland Novak. But all his plans change when a cute blue-haired girl named Eureka crashes her LFO robot into his home. When enemy LFOs attack her robot, Renton is faced with daunting responsibility of saving the girl he loves.After the battle in the sky, Renton is greeted by Holland with an offer to come aboard his ship, the Gekkostate. This is an offer that Renton cannot refuse, and the start of his new adventures.""Eureka Seven"" is a beautiful masterpiece of flashing colors, liquid-smooth fighting animation and romance. Although it opens like a simple romance, it develops into a hard-edged drama of humongous proportions. Gekkostate is at war with the United Federation Force over the fate of the world, and the battles are emotionally shattering.For starters, Eureka is as emotionally detached as the Evangelion character, Rei Ayanami. She hides the crushing emotional guilt of killing innocent people. And as much as Holland hides the truth, Renton is bound to discover that Eureka is an emotionally depressed girl who is definitely out of this world. Literally.Eureka and Renton express extreme angst throughout the series, but their relationship is very compassionate. There's plenty of sadness in the middle of this volume of the collection. However, the characters' constant struggle to help each other through the most difficult times is incredibly heartwarming.""Eureka Seven"" is a series which I can never stop watching. Even when Holland's defensive hold on Eureka tends to overwhelm Gekkostate, Renton is a remarkable character who truly understands what is best for her.Although the release of the Complete Collection  of Eureka Seven is far overdue, the drama and power of ""Eureka Seven"" is still unmatched.

1129696,A1JVIK74V0DU4C,B00114UUL8,KADC,"[12, 12]","If you're looking at this I'm sure you've already seen the rave reviews for this series elsewhere, so I'll briefly add my two cents that this is indeed the single best science fiction series ever, animated or otherwise.Volume 2 (don't forget to buy volume 2 as well) concludes the series with the same perfection you are soon to experience in this first half of the series. By the time the series ends, ""Eureka seveN"", unlike so many other series, not only answers every question you may have had and delivers several ""Holy crap!"" surprises, it actually has a very good, very satisfying ending.I'm a very nit-picky person when it comes to my entertainment, but other than breathing at high altitudes and at tremendous speeds without some kind of air mask and and never changing their clothes despite several scenes where the female cast go shopping, there is not one scene, not one word of dialogue, which I can complain about. ""Eureka seveN"" is not only a fantastic and original science fiction story, it is impeccably well told from start to finish. Like ""Cowboy Bebop"", it's the kind of showpiece you can lend to your anim&eacute; hating friends to show them than anim&eacute; has come a long way since ""Robotech"" and ""Captain Harlock"" that they watched on TV when they were little.Nice menus, good quality video and audio, and the English voice acting is as good as the original Japanese cast (yes it is, purists -- accept it) and I'd go so far as to say it's better because having Renton (the main character) voiced by a boy instead of a woman sounds a lot more convincing. Subtitle options include the now standard (for the most part) of well translated full subtitles or translations for Japanese words that appear in scenes only. Also, the opening and ending songs include both English translations and romaji for those who enjoy singing along.My only disappointment is that the audio wasn't remastered into surround sound, but otherwise this collection is proof that Bandai finally ""gets it"" and has stopped buying properties to just dump cheap English dubs on us.The extra's are a bit dry and the limited number of trailers for other series is disappointing as is having the first two openings and endings appearing textless only once each, but it's a far cry from Bandai's past standard of not giving us any extras at all.All of the commentary (one episode per disc) is ""hosted"" by the Japanese voice actors for Renton and Eureka with one or two of the other cast members as ""guests"", and with few exceptions this is rather like listening to a bunch of friends getting together and talking as they rarely bother to comment on the show itself. The sole exception is when the director ""guests"" and gives insights into some of the symbolism, much to the surprise of the ditsy hosts who clearly thought that this was just another dumb animated series. You'll lose track of the number of times they say with shock and surprise ""...and this aired at 7am on Sunday morning!"" every time a serious scene comes on.The cast interviews (again, one per disc) with the English and Japanese voice cast is hit or miss (mostly miss) but that's the case with most DVDs; however, I would have preferred interviews with the people responsible for the actual production of this series like the directors and writers as I'd love to hear more about the symbolism, etc., but again, it's better than the nothing Bandai usually gives us.In conclusion, don't hesitate to buy this series, and specifically, this two volume set of the complete series of ""Eureka seveN"" as this is no cheap bootleg or half-assed production: This is a good quality product.",5,the first half of the greatest animated science fiction story ever,1300838400,"03 23, 2011",2011,3636,"[""'re"", 'looking', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'rave', 'reviews', 'series', 'elsewhere', ""'ll"", 'briefly', 'add', 'two', 'cents', 'indeed', 'single', 'best', 'science', 'fiction', 'series', 'ever', 'animated', 'otherwise.Volume', '2', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'buy', 'volume', '2', 'as', 'well', 'series', 'same', 'perfection', 'are', 'soon', 'experience', 'first', 'half', 'series', 'time', 'series', 'Eureka', 'seveN', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'series', 'not', 'only', 'question', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'delivers', 'several', 'Holy', 'crap', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'satisfying', 'ending.I', ""'m"", 'very', 'nit-picky', 'person', 'when', 'entertainment', 'other', 'breathing', 'high', 'altitudes', 'tremendous', 'speeds', 'kind', 'air', 'mask', 'never', 'changing', 'clothes', 'several', 'scenes', 'where', 'female', 'cast', 'go', 'shopping', 'not', 'one', 'scene', 'not', 'one', 'word', 'dialogue', 'can', 'complain', 'Eureka', 'seveN', 'not', 'only', 'fantastic', 'original', 'science', 'fiction', 'story', 'impeccably', 'well', 'told', 'start', 'finish', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'kind', 'showpiece', 'can', 'lend', 'anim', 'eacute', 'hating', 'friends', 'show', 'anim', 'eacute', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'Robotech', 'Captain', 'Harlock', 'watched', 'TV', 'when', 'were', 'little.Nice', 'menus', 'good', 'quality', 'video', 'audio', 'English', 'voice', 'acting', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'Japanese', 'cast', 'yes', 'purists', ""'d"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'better', 'having', 'Renton', 'main', 'character', 'voiced', 'boy', 'instead', 'woman', 'lot', 'more', 'convincing', 'Subtitle', 'options', 'include', 'now', 'standard', 'most', 'part', 'well', 'translated', 'full', 'subtitles', 'translations', 'Japanese', 'words', 'appear', 'scenes', 'only', 'Also', 'opening', 'ending', 'songs', 'include', 'English', 'translations', 'romaji', 'who', 'enjoy', 'singing', 'only', 'disappointment', 'audio', 'was', ""n't"", 'remastered', 'surround', 'sound', 'otherwise', 'collection', 'proof', 'Bandai', 'finally', 'stopped', 'buying', 'properties', 'just', 'dump', 'cheap', 'English', 'dubs', 'us.The', 'extra', 'are', 'bit', 'dry', 'limited', 'number', 'trailers', 'other', 'series', 'disappointing', 'having', 'first', 'two', 'openings', 'endings', 'appearing', 'textless', 'only', 'once', 'far', 'cry', 'Bandai', 'past', 'standard', 'not', 'giving', 'extras', 'all.All', 'commentary', 'one', 'episode', 'disc', 'hosted', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'Renton', 'Eureka', 'one', 'two', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'guests', 'few', 'exceptions', 'rather', 'like', 'listening', 'bunch', 'friends', 'getting', 'together', 'talking', 'rarely', 'bother', 'comment', 'show', 'sole', 'exception', 'when', 'director', 'guests', 'insights', 'symbolism', 'much', 'surprise', 'ditsy', 'hosts', 'who', 'clearly', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'dumb', 'animated', 'series', ""'ll"", 'lose', 'track', 'number', 'times', 'say', 'shock', 'surprise', 'aired', '7am', 'Sunday', 'morning', 'time', 'serious', 'scene', 'on.The', 'cast', 'interviews', 'again', 'one', 'disc', 'English', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'cast', 'hit', 'miss', 'mostly', 'miss', 'case', 'most', 'DVDs', 'however', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'interviews', 'people', 'responsible', 'actual', 'production', 'series', 'directors', 'writers', ""'d"", 'love', 'hear', 'more', 'symbolism', 'etc.', 'again', 'better', 'nothing', 'Bandai', 'usually', 'us.In', 'conclusion', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'buy', 'series', 'specifically', 'two', 'volume', 'set', 'complete', 'series', 'Eureka', 'seveN', 'cheap', 'bootleg', 'half-assed', 'production', 'good', 'quality', 'product']",Eureka Seven: Volume 12
1129697,A1ZGAZLH9K711I,B00114UUL8,Keonyn,"[4, 4]","This was an amazing conclusion to a very well done series. It managed to keep things changing and unexpected, all while presenting a well told and dynamic conclusion to the story and avoiding significant cliches. Everything introduced throughout the series 50 episode run comes together to present this concrete and satisfying conclusion that manages to avoid making things feel to fairy tale or textbook, but still doesn't fall in to the trap of overdoing it or making things too ambiguous and leaving a lot of loose ends.This series is a character drama, and as such that is the real focus of the finale. The conflict and how it presents itself plays a significant factor, no doubt about it, but Renton and Eureka are the true focus and in that regard they pull it off perfectly. It's a roller coaster ride with a lot of ups and downs, times that feel like all is lost and times you can't help but cheer at the screen. On top of that, a lot of things are explained in this volume regarding the story and the world the series takes place on.All in all it's a magnificent conclusion that doesn't disappoint. I find that usually is the biggest problem I encounter with anime is that the conclusions tend to be disappointing. I'm very happy that Eureka Seven, one of my favorite series, did not encounter this problem. This is especially relieving considering I read the manga through and was disappointed by how it was concluded.This is a special edition, so it comes with a shirt like the others. In this case we get a light green shirt in size large with the military's logos printed on the upper front and upper back of the shirt. It also comes with the 2nd, and last, volume of the 2nd manga series; ""Gravity Boys & Lifting Girl"", which isn't bad, but it doesn't relate to the events in the series much at all.

Too many times does the show center around the kids and their emotions that at times it drags on.

Surfing mecha was something I hadn't considered before, let alone sky surfing mecha. The characters along with this are all quite enjoyable.I will however give the series a thumb down for getting inspiration from Evangelion. I get it that EVA was an epic anime which defined a generation. But frankly, not everyone likes EVA or sitting through a psychotherapy session with a character that never seems to learn anything. This happens in the story very strongly with Renton. It gets to the point you just want to strangle the little brat. I get his anguish, really I do. But enough, time to move the story along. Thankfully E7 does, unlike EVA which even in the end never gets beyond psychosis.The other thumb down would be involving the structure and storytelling of the second half. It is considerably weak. The backstory that sounded so epic as it was built up, seems to disappear when you find out what is really going on. What the lifeforms are and the scenes following that are quite anti climactic. Then as it finally comes to completion it leaves you mildly satisfied with a lot of questions and not enough answers.Really its a great show, enjoy it for what it does right. But enough with the EVA love already. How much something copies or doesn't copy EVA should not be a standard of if it is good or not. Seeing a protagonist hero being presented as a human through anguish is one thing, but not moving past that and not finally learning how to cope just turns a show from a great piece, into little more watching a kid cower and whine over and over.",4,"Good, unique, but 2nd part does suffer",1309651200,"07 3, 2011",2011,1684,"['Wo', ""n't"", 'argue', 'not', 'good', 'Really', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'very', 'unique', 'world', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'style', 'presentation', 'Surfing', 'mecha', 'was', 'something', 'had', ""n't"", 'considered', 'before', 'let', 'alone', 'sky', 'surfing', 'mecha', 'characters', 'are', 'quite', 'enjoyable.I', 'will', 'however', 'give', 'series', 'thumb', 'down', 'getting', 'inspiration', 'Evangelion', 'get', 'EVA', 'was', 'epic', 'anime', 'defined', 'generation', 'frankly', 'not', 'everyone', 'EVA', 'sitting', 'psychotherapy', 'session', 'character', 'never', 'learn', 'anything', 'story', 'very', 'strongly', 'Renton', 'point', 'just', 'want', 'strangle', 'little', 'brat', 'get', 'anguish', 'really', 'do', 'enough', 'time', 'move', 'story', 'along', 'Thankfully', 'E7', 'EVA', 'even', 'end', 'never', 'psychosis.The', 'other', 'thumb', 'down', 'would', 'be', 'involving', 'structure', 'storytelling', 'second', 'half', 'considerably', 'weak', 'backstory', 'sounded', 'so', 'epic', 'was', 'built', 'up', 'disappear', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'What', 'lifeforms', 'are', 'scenes', 'following', 'are', 'quite', 'anti', 'climactic', 'Then', 'finally', 'completion', 'mildly', 'satisfied', 'lot', 'questions', 'not', 'enough', 'answers.Really', 'great', 'show', 'enjoy', 'what', 'right', 'enough', 'EVA', 'love', 'already', 'How', 'much', 'something', 'copies', ""n't"", 'copy', 'EVA', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'standard', 'good', 'not', 'Seeing', 'protagonist', 'hero', 'being', 'presented', 'human', 'anguish', 'one', 'thing', 'not', 'moving', 'not', 'finally', 'learning', 'how', 'cope', 'just', 'show', 'great', 'piece', 'little', 'more', 'watching', 'kid', 'cower', 'whine']",Eureka Seven: Volume 12

I decided to write this review to give a little warning about what could have been one of the best anime mecha shows in the last few years.Now my review of the rest of the series is why I am writing this today. The first ""season"" of Eureka Seven ( 1-26 ) is an incredible roller coaster ride that will both dazzle you and take you to places you wouldn't have considered before. The second half of the series however is an INCREDIBLE disappointment. What was strong in the first season is weak in the second. Strangely, also some episode budgets must have been cut in the second season as I could see marked difference in quality between episodes. By far some of the worst episodes are in the second half of the show and I cannot begin to tell you how bad they are without possibly spoiling part of the story for you which I am loathe to do. The story potential that was in the first half of Eureka Seven with its mysteries and life lessons are concluded badly and at times forgotten about in the second half, basically meaning the show felt like they were creating the ending as they were releasing episodes. This generally works well in episodic shows but with such buildup, character development, and mystery that was in the first half this does not work here. To be honest if it was not for the first half I doubt I would have been able to finish watching the second, it was that painful to watch at times.I wrote this review to warn you what will be coming ahead and to say that Eureka Seven is an excellent anime with an unfortunate finish.

The series main couple fourteen year old Renton and at least fifteen year old Eureka(Since her true age isn't really revealed) are also enjoyable to watch especially near the beginning as Renton infatuated with Eureka tries to go out of his way to woo her and win over the three young orphan children who see her as their mother and Renton as a threat.  The series doesn't rely to much on the mecha battles as much as the gundam series does and takes a more solid step of the overall story of the series and its morals,  which while still somewhat confusing in some areas is much more easier to understand than the series NGE was.  The audio voice cast for the English and Japanese crew were incredible for this series but the animation is a more love it or hate it scenario depending on your own personal likes of how characters should be drawn,  I myself grew to use to how other animators drew characters for series like Full Metal Panic, Gundam Seed/Destiny, and Full Metal Alchemist.

I hadn't seen anything like it before and it really only gets better with repeat viewings....but upon purchasing this DVD set and rewatching it for the first time since it left American airwaves I have to acknowledge that Eureka Seven is my favorite anime.Why? Well, for one thing I suppose it boils down to me being a romantic at heart, and there is a lot of sentimentality going on in Eureka Seven. As a matter of fact, gosh-darn true love is the biggest theme of the series! But that's not to say it's all mushy stuff. In actuality a lot of horrible things happen in the world of Eureka Seven and there's tragedy and brutality to spare. That's what makes the romance, hope, and various other positive emotions also on display mean something: beauty in the face of adversity.Of course, an assortment of likeable characters, beautiful animation, and a really kickass soundtrack also help!But let's get to the matter at hand: this DVD set containing the first 26 episodes.Eureka Seven is one of the few full-year (around 50 episodes) long anime that held my attention all the way through. It's the perfect length: I never felt like there was filler or things were being dragged out. The story is exactly as long as it needs to be, and one of the reasons the 50 episode format works is that each half of the series is very different. To put it bluntly: this DVD set introduces us to the world and the relationships, and we have ample time to explore them both. The second half, which is the next DVD set, plunges this world which we are now emotionally invested in into a hell. Dramatic, no?To be more specific: Eureka Seven occurs in a far-off future where the human race dwells on a mysterious planet covered in something called ""Scub Coral"" and with the atmosphere full of something called ""Trapar Waves."" The Trapars are cool, because it allows one to do the really uber-cool sport of ""lifting,"" basically surfing in the sky. It also allows the various technologies like robots and flying machines to fly. 14 year old Renton loves to lift, and he idolizes legendary lifter Holland and his counter-culture commune The Gekkostate. When Renton ends up actually meeting The Gekkostate he joins and finds out it isn't as glamorous as he imagined: Holland can be difficult to get along with, the members of the crew all have to work for their keep, and to top it all off they're not so much a group of carefree lifters as a band of government rebels! But in consolation for Renton he meets and falls in love (at first sight) with a  mysterious Gekkostate member his own age, a girl named Eureka who pilots an equally mysterious robot called The Nirvash. Renton's arrival triggers a change in both Eureka and the Nirvash, so Holland makes Renton's Eureka's partner, much to his delight - but he has no real conception of what the real motives of the Gekkostate are, and just what he has got himself into.",5,Eureka Seven is enthralling!,1300147200,"03 15, 2011",2011,3115,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'conditioned', 'say', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'whenever', 'asked', 'what', 'favorite', 'anime', 'series', 'good', 'reason', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'series', 'going', 'decade', 'was', 'quite', 'revelation', 'first', 'viewing', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'really', 'only', 'better', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'set', 'rewatching', 'first', 'time', 'left', 'American', 'airwaves', 'have', 'acknowledge', 'Eureka', 'Seven', 'favorite', 'anime.Why', 'Well', 'one', 'thing', 'suppose', 'down', 'being', 'romantic', 'heart', 'lot', 'sentimentality', 'going', 'Eureka', 'Seven', 'matter', 'fact', 'gosh-darn', 'true', 'love', 'biggest', 'theme', 'series', 'not', 'say', 'mushy', 'stuff', 'actuality', 'lot', 'horrible', 'things', 'happen', 'world', 'Eureka', 'Seven', 'tragedy', 'brutality', 'spare', 'what', 'romance', 'hope', 'various', 'other', 'positive', 'emotions', 'also', 'display', 'mean', 'something', 'beauty', 'face', 'adversity.Of', 'course', 'assortment', 'likeable', 'characters', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'really', 'kickass', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'help', 'let', 'get', 'matter', 'hand', 'DVD', 'set', 'containing', 'first', '26', 'episodes.Eureka', 'Seven', 'one', 'few', 'full-year', '50', 'episodes', 'long', 'anime', 'held', 'attention', 'way', 'perfect', 'length', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'filler', 'things', 'were', 'being', 'dragged', 'out', 'story', 'exactly', 'as', 'long', 'be', 'one', 'reasons', '50', 'episode', 'format', 'half', 'series', 'very', 'different', 'put', 'bluntly', 'DVD', 'set', 'introduces', 'world', 'relationships', 'have', 'ample', 'time', 'explore', 'second', 'half', 'next', 'DVD', 'set', 'world', 'are', 'now', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'hell', 'Dramatic', 'be', 'more', 'specific', 'Eureka', 'Seven', 'far-off', 'future', 'where', 'human', 'race', 'dwells', 'mysterious', 'planet', 'covered', 'something', 'called', 'Scub', 'Coral', 'atmosphere', 'full', 'something', 'called', 'Trapar', 'Waves', 'Trapars', 'are', 'cool', 'one', 'do', 'really', 'uber-cool', 'sport', 'lifting', 'basically', 'surfing', 'sky', 'also', 'various', 'technologies', 'robots', 'flying', 'machines', 'fly', '14', 'year', 'old', 'Renton', 'lift', 'legendary', 'lifter', 'Holland', 'counter-culture', 'commune', 'Gekkostate', 'When', 'Renton', 'up', 'actually', 'meeting', 'Gekkostate', 'out', ""n't"", 'as', 'glamorous', 'imagined', 'Holland', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'get', 'members', 'crew', 'have', 'work', 'keep', 'top', ""'re"", 'not', 'so', 'much', 'group', 'carefree', 'lifters', 'band', 'government', 'rebels', 'consolation', 'Renton', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'mysterious', 'Gekkostate', 'member', 'own', 'age', 'girl', 'named', 'Eureka', 'who', 'pilots', 'equally', 'mysterious', 'robot', 'called', 'Nirvash', 'Renton', 'arrival', 'change', 'Eureka', 'Nirvash', 'so', 'Holland', 'Renton', 'Eureka', 'partner', 'much', 'delight', 'real', 'conception', 'what', 'real', 'motives', 'Gekkostate', 'are', 'just', 'what', 'got']",Eureka Seven: Volume 12

If you love crazy mecha action, you need to see it, period.I'm not kidding.  This show has me thinking . . . . dare I even say it. . . that it is even better than my beloved Evangelion.  I never thought there would be anything that could ever come along that would make me even suffer a fleeting thought like that but with Eureka 7, my mind has been flooded with that realization. . . . Eureka 7 may be the greatest anime series of all-time.Now it has to be said, there are a lot of similarities between Eva and Eureka 7, and you can tell that BONES was highly influenced when creating this story by the classic Angel series. How only the ""chosen"" can pilot the Nirvash (just like the 1st, 2nd and 3rd child in Eva) and there seems at least at the beginning to be another alien race that wants to destroy mankind (like the Angels in Eva) and that the subject of rebirth for mankind (the Third Impact).  But Eureka 7 seems to run with these themes and tie them all together with one of the most heart-wrenching love stories I have ever seen.  Pure brilliance.And I have to say that I have watched the series both with the Eng subtitles and with the Eng dub and I have to say the English translation on the dub is great and perhaps delivers an even more moving performance from the voice actors.I have never teared up more at an anime.  Weird.  What always got to me was during the English dub at the end of every episode Renton and Eureka would both say in unison ""To be continued. . ."" but in a way and tone that reflects how the episode ends emotionally.  At the end of many episodes they sounded happy, chipper, excited, relieved, worried. . . it really let you know how the characters were feeling.But what really got to me was the end of episode 47 I think.  They had such a sound of hopelessness in their voices like everything was done. . . and then at the end of episode 49 . . . there was only Renton uttering those words.
