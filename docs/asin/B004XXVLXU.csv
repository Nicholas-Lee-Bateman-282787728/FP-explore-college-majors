It does not drag. It goes very quickly and has a ending.....well, I do not ever give away anything. I highly recommend this series. The acting is the best.  The action is on going and the suspense builds and builds. I am glad I added this to my collection. Thanks Amazon for a great selection and very good prices. If Amazon does not have it in stock, they have some good sellers available who are honesst and prompt.

1432887,A1VDRK69F22YMN,B004XXVLXU,Anticlimacus,"[5, 5]","Wikipedia gives the following information: ""Iris is a South Korean espionage television drama series broadcast by KBS in 2009. With a budget in excess of 20 billion won (17 million USD), it, along with its spin-off Athena: Goddess of War, share the record for the most expensive Korean dramas ever produced. Premiering in October 2009, the series was a critical and commercial success, with an average viewership of over 30% in addition to ranking as the top program consistently every week after its debut. The series also took home many of the highest honors at the 2009 KBS Drama Acting Awards, including Byung-hun Lee winning the top recognition, the Daesang Award. Among other nominations and recognitions, Lee and Tae-hee Kim were also named as one of the best on-screen couples.""My Review In One Breath: This series (20 episodes, 60 minutes each) concerns a National Security System agent who attempts to take down a secret organization. After the introductory opening episodes, the missions are similar to what one would find in the American ""24"" series (excluding the ""real time"" element), with agents attempting to stop terrorist attacks with the use of satellites and information support technicians. Of course, this is in the Korean style with some romance and melodrama blended in. Acting is top notch, with Byung-hun Lee in the lead role and a very good supporting cast: Tae-hee Kim (his love interest and fellow agent), Seung-woo Kim (a North Korean agent) and So-yeon Kim (as the gorgeous North Korean sniper). Production values are slick, the scoring is great at times, and the pacing is very fast for a K-drama with plenty of shootouts (a few of which are fantastic) and suspense. Storyline is clich&eacute;d but the secret organization is intriguing and represents a brilliant little twist on the North/South Korean conflict. Consequently, the relationships between the characters change significantly in exciting ways and the viewer will have an emotional investment in the protagonists. Highly addictive stuff.",5,"If you liked ""24"", you're gonna like this one too.",1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,2031,"['Wikipedia', 'following', 'information', 'Iris', 'South', 'Korean', 'espionage', 'television', 'drama', 'series', 'broadcast', 'KBS', '2009', 'budget', 'excess', '20', 'billion', 'won', '17', 'million', 'USD', 'spin-off', 'Athena', 'Goddess', 'War', 'share', 'record', 'most', 'expensive', 'Korean', 'dramas', 'ever', 'produced', 'Premiering', 'October', '2009', 'series', 'was', 'critical', 'commercial', 'success', 'average', 'viewership', '30', '%', 'addition', 'ranking', 'top', 'program', 'consistently', 'week', 'debut', 'series', 'also', 'took', 'home', 'many', 'highest', 'honors', '2009', 'KBS', 'Drama', 'Acting', 'Awards', 'including', 'Byung-hun', 'Lee', 'winning', 'top', 'recognition', 'Daesang', 'Award', 'other', 'nominations', 'recognitions', 'Lee', 'Tae-hee', 'Kim', 'were', 'also', 'named', 'one', 'best', 'on-screen', 'couples', 'Review', 'One', 'Breath', 'series', '20', 'episodes', '60', 'minutes', 'National', 'Security', 'System', 'agent', 'who', 'take', 'down', 'secret', 'organization', 'introductory', 'opening', 'episodes', 'missions', 'are', 'similar', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'find', 'American', '24', 'series', 'excluding', 'real', 'time', 'element', 'agents', 'attempting', 'stop', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'use', 'satellites', 'information', 'support', 'technicians', 'course', 'Korean', 'style', 'romance', 'melodrama', 'blended', 'Acting', 'top', 'notch', 'Byung-hun', 'Lee', 'lead', 'role', 'very', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Tae-hee', 'Kim', 'love', 'interest', 'fellow', 'agent', 'Seung-woo', 'Kim', 'North', 'Korean', 'agent', 'So-yeon', 'Kim', 'gorgeous', 'North', 'Korean', 'sniper', 'Production', 'values', 'are', 'slick', 'scoring', 'great', 'times', 'pacing', 'very', 'fast', 'K-drama', 'plenty', 'shootouts', 'few', 'are', 'fantastic', 'suspense', 'Storyline', 'clich', 'eacute', 'secret', 'organization', 'intriguing', 'brilliant', 'little', 'twist', 'North/South', 'Korean', 'conflict', 'Consequently', 'relationships', 'characters', 'change', 'significantly', 'exciting', 'ways', 'viewer', 'will', 'have', 'emotional', 'investment', 'protagonists', 'Highly', 'addictive', 'stuff']","Iris Korean Tv Drama Dvd English Subtitle NTSC All Region (Complete Series , 20 Episodes 6 Dvd Boxset)"

The distributer's name goes across the screen every so often (I've been told this is because they get pirated). The ghosted name is distracting to say the least. Besides the really sad and pointless ending, the English subtitles were done poorly and they are often too quick to read. It makes me want to go back to movies put out by YA Entertainment rather than PohKim.

It is one of the best espionage dramas produced.The action revolves around a young man named Hyun Jun, who is best friends with his roommate, Jin Sa Woo.  They excel at everything and compete against each other within the Special Forces.  They are approached separately by a beautiful woman named Seung Hee, whom they both fall in love with.  They are surprised later to learn that she is part of an elite, covert division called NSS, and that she has been a part of their recruitment.  Ultimately however, she does choose one of them.Their lives play out like a Greek tragedy however, as they race to prevent a nuclear bomb from being detonated in the center of Seoul.  There is greed, corruption, and hunger for power throughout the series.At the end, the viewer is faced with the stark realization that many of the political wars and chaos throughout our world have been perpetuated by the desire for wealth by numerous arms dealers.  We have long known that war is good for the economy, but it shakes one to realize that many of the political disturbances between countries have been instigated and devised solely to perpetuate the sale of arms and military weapons.",5,Heart-Pounding!,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,1252,"['IRIS', 'fast-paced', 'heart-pounding', 'Korean', 'spy', 'thriller', 'English', 'subtitles', 'one', 'best', 'espionage', 'dramas', 'produced.The', 'action', 'around', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Hyun', 'Jun', 'who', 'best', 'friends', 'roommate', 'Jin', 'Sa', 'Woo', 'excel', 'everything', 'compete', 'other', 'Special', 'Forces', 'are', 'approached', 'separately', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'named', 'Seung', 'Hee', 'whom', 'fall', 'love', 'are', 'surprised', 'later', 'learn', 'part', 'elite', 'covert', 'division', 'called', 'NSS', 'been', 'part', 'recruitment', 'Ultimately', 'however', 'choose', 'one', 'them.Their', 'lives', 'play', 'out', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'however', 'race', 'prevent', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'being', 'detonated', 'center', 'Seoul', 'greed', 'corruption', 'hunger', 'power', 'series.At', 'end', 'viewer', 'faced', 'stark', 'realization', 'many', 'political', 'wars', 'chaos', 'world', 'have', 'been', 'perpetuated', 'desire', 'wealth', 'numerous', 'arms', 'dealers', 'have', 'long', 'known', 'war', 'good', 'economy', 'one', 'realize', 'many', 'political', 'disturbances', 'countries', 'have', 'been', 'instigated', 'devised', 'solely', 'perpetuate', 'sale', 'arms', 'military', 'weapons']","Iris Korean Tv Drama Dvd English Subtitle NTSC All Region (Complete Series , 20 Episodes 6 Dvd Boxset)"
