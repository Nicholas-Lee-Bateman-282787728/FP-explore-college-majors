Print quality is completely watchable not great but if you love the movie its well worth the cheap price.  Its one of the better Alpha releases. The contrast is a little light and during one of the songs the film is a little shakey. I've viewed this film on two tv's and 1 computer each with their own leval of visual clarity, with the computer being the best.  The sound is pretty good it olnly gets a little hiss-y when the volume is turned up.The songs sung by Betty Hutton are:""Love Me""""If I had A Dozen Hearts""""Doctor, Lawyer, Indian Chief""""In the Shade Of the Old Apple Tree""""I'm A Square In the Social Circle""I Hope this Helps................",3,5 Star Movie with a 3 Star Treatment,1102032000,"12 3, 2004",2004,708,"['Just', 'quick', 'note', 'DVD', 'quality', 'Alpha', 'Release', 'Print', 'quality', 'completely', 'watchable', 'not', 'great', 'love', 'movie', 'well', 'cheap', 'price', 'one', 'better', 'Alpha', 'releases', 'contrast', 'little', 'light', 'one', 'songs', 'film', 'little', 'shakey', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'film', 'two', 'tv', '1', 'computer', 'own', 'leval', 'visual', 'clarity', 'computer', 'being', 'best', 'sound', 'pretty', 'good', 'olnly', 'little', 'hiss-y', 'when', 'volume', 'turned', 'up.The', 'songs', 'sung', 'Betty', 'Hutton', 'are', 'Love', 'Me', 'had', 'Dozen', 'Hearts', 'Doctor', 'Lawyer', 'Indian', 'Chief', 'Shade', 'Old', 'Apple', 'Tree', ""'m"", 'Square', 'Social', 'Circle', 'Hope', 'Helps']",Stork Club

710099,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00006AUGQ,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[12, 12]","I can't comment on the quality of this particular video transfer, but this is a pretty fun film.  Singer/comedienne Betty Hutton stars as a gal working as a hat check girl in the hottest club in town, in the waning days of WWII.  Being wholesome and all-American as she is, when Hutton spots a doddering old man falling into the ocean when she's out for a swim, she naturally saves his life and hauls him back onshore.  What she doesn't know is that the old curmudgeon, played in a broad Irish brogue by a winsome Barry Fitzgerald, is really a misanthropic bazillionaire, who is naturally quite moved by her selflessness.  He anonymously arranges for her to be provided for financially, but can't resist hanging around to see what happens when she's given all his dough.  Complications ensue when her boyfriend comes back from the war and gets bent out of shape wondering who her new sugar daddy is, and she has to try to patch things up.  At the heart of this movie is a fabulous performance by Betty Hutton (who's sister Marion was a featured vocalist in the Glenn Miller band, and who bears an uncanny resemblance to Joan Cusack, sister of John...)  She is as cute and as charming as they come, and when she does her comedic song-and-dance numbers, she'll blow your mind.  Hutton's vocal range and physical ability are both amazing -- how many people have you seen moon-walk in high heels while belting out a great tune like &quot;Square In A Social Circle&quot;?  The other great performance is by the no-nonsense nightclub owner, played by Bill Goodwin, who gets off some crisp one-liners.  The plot drags a bit, but this is still a nice wartime B-movie, and a must-see for any potential Hutton fans out there.",4,Good lighthearted fun,1036108800,"11 1, 2002",2002,1715,"['ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'quality', 'particular', 'video', 'transfer', 'pretty', 'fun', 'film', 'Singer/comedienne', 'Betty', 'Hutton', 'gal', 'working', 'hat', 'check', 'girl', 'hottest', 'club', 'town', 'waning', 'days', 'WWII', 'Being', 'wholesome', 'all-American', 'when', 'Hutton', 'doddering', 'old', 'man', 'falling', 'ocean', 'when', 'out', 'swim', 'naturally', 'life', 'hauls', 'back', 'onshore', 'What', ""n't"", 'know', 'old', 'curmudgeon', 'played', 'broad', 'Irish', 'brogue', 'winsome', 'Barry', 'Fitzgerald', 'really', 'misanthropic', 'bazillionaire', 'who', 'naturally', 'quite', 'moved', 'selflessness', 'anonymously', 'be', 'provided', 'financially', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'hanging', 'around', 'see', 'what', 'when', 'given', 'dough', 'Complications', 'ensue', 'when', 'boyfriend', 'back', 'war', 'bent', 'shape', 'wondering', 'who', 'new', 'sugar', 'daddy', 'try', 'patch', 'things', 'up', 'heart', 'movie', 'fabulous', 'performance', 'Betty', 'Hutton', 'who', 'sister', 'Marion', 'was', 'featured', 'vocalist', 'Glenn', 'Miller', 'band', 'who', 'uncanny', 'resemblance', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'sister', 'John', 'cute', 'as', 'charming', 'come', 'when', 'comedic', 'song-and-dance', 'numbers', ""'ll"", 'blow', 'mind', 'Hutton', 'vocal', 'range', 'physical', 'ability', 'are', 'amazing', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'moon-walk', 'high', 'heels', 'belting', 'out', 'great', 'tune', 'quot', 'Square', 'A', 'Social', 'Circle', 'quot', 'other', 'great', 'performance', 'no-nonsense', 'nightclub', 'owner', 'played', 'Bill', 'Goodwin', 'who', 'off', 'crisp', 'one-liners', 'plot', 'bit', 'still', 'nice', 'wartime', 'B-movie', 'must-see', 'potential', 'Hutton', 'fans', 'out', 'there']",Stork Club

710101,A30Q8X8B1S3GGT,B00006AUGQ,"Mark Savary ""moon_city""","[7, 10]","If you've never heard of this film, there's probably a good reason why; it's average to the point of being dull. But that isn't to say that the film is not worth a look.Betty Hutton and Barry Fitzgerald both serve admirably in this musical comedy, but there are few if any surprises that would make it stand out. As it is, the movie never really gets beyond predictable.Hatcheck girl at the Stork Club and aspiring singer Hutton saves millionaire Fitzgerald from drowning, and assumes he's broke and down on his luck. But Fitzgerald decides to secretly be Hutton's financial angel, and help her live the high life. Problems ensue when Hutton's soldier boyfriend and aspiring band leader assumes that Hutton is a &quot;kept woman,&quot; and has a jealous fit.Robert Benchley plays Fitzgerald's lawyer with some humor, while Iris Adrian is fun as Hutton's best friend Gwen, but beyond them, the balance of supporting cast is fair to average. In fact, most of the comedy is derived from Fitzgerald's mugging over the painfully crazy spending habits of Hutton rather than the comedy of errors over who thinks who is supposedly seeing who on the sly.The music in the film also ranges. Some of the songs are entertaining, if not memorable. &quot;Doctor, Lawyer, Indian Chief&quot; and &quot;If I Had A Dozen Hearts&quot; are both pretty good, but at least one number is really annoying. &quot;I'm a Square in the Social Circle&quot; is bothersome not because of the lyrics, but from the sheer volume blasting at you. The poor audio quality makes Hutton sound more like she's hollering than singing, and it's hard to tell if this was due to a bad recording session back in 1945, or a poor audio transfer to DVD.The Stork Club itself is strangely only incidental to the story, although the famous nightclub was faithfully recreated on Hollywood soundstages. The sad thing is that the nightclub depicted in the movie has little to do with the actual club, and as such the movie lacks something the title implies.The movie is only entertaining as far as it goes, so it isn't really a keeper. Still, it is a good example of a low-budget studio musical from the time, and has little or no objectionable material.",3,Average musical...,1072828800,"12 31, 2003",2003,2200,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'probably', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'average', 'point', 'being', 'dull', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'not', 'worth', 'look.Betty', 'Hutton', 'Barry', 'Fitzgerald', 'serve', 'admirably', 'musical', 'comedy', 'are', 'few', 'surprises', 'would', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'predictable.Hatcheck', 'girl', 'Stork', 'Club', 'aspiring', 'singer', 'Hutton', 'millionaire', 'Fitzgerald', 'drowning', 'broke', 'down', 'luck', 'Fitzgerald', 'secretly', 'be', 'Hutton', 'financial', 'angel', 'help', 'live', 'high', 'life', 'Problems', 'ensue', 'when', 'Hutton', 'soldier', 'boyfriend', 'aspiring', 'band', 'leader', 'Hutton', 'quot', 'woman', 'quot', 'jealous', 'fit.Robert', 'Benchley', 'Fitzgerald', 'lawyer', 'humor', 'Iris', 'Adrian', 'fun', 'Hutton', 'best', 'friend', 'Gwen', 'balance', 'supporting', 'cast', 'fair', 'average', 'fact', 'most', 'comedy', 'derived', 'Fitzgerald', 'mugging', 'painfully', 'crazy', 'spending', 'habits', 'Hutton', 'rather', 'comedy', 'errors', 'who', 'thinks', 'who', 'supposedly', 'seeing', 'who', 'sly.The', 'music', 'film', 'also', 'songs', 'are', 'entertaining', 'not', 'memorable', 'quot', 'Doctor', 'Lawyer', 'Indian', 'Chief', 'quot', 'quot', 'Had', 'Dozen', 'Hearts', 'quot', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'least', 'one', 'number', 'really', 'annoying', 'quot', ""'m"", 'Square', 'Social', 'Circle', 'quot', 'bothersome', 'not', 'lyrics', 'sheer', 'volume', 'blasting', 'poor', 'audio', 'quality', 'Hutton', 'sound', 'more', 'hollering', 'singing', 'hard', 'tell', 'was', 'due', 'bad', 'recording', 'session', 'back', '1945', 'poor', 'audio', 'transfer', 'DVD.The', 'Stork', 'Club', 'strangely', 'only', 'incidental', 'story', 'famous', 'nightclub', 'was', 'faithfully', 'recreated', 'Hollywood', 'soundstages', 'sad', 'thing', 'nightclub', 'depicted', 'movie', 'little', 'do', 'actual', 'club', 'such', 'movie', 'something', 'title', 'implies.The', 'movie', 'only', 'entertaining', 'as', 'far', ""n't"", 'really', 'keeper', 'Still', 'good', 'example', 'low-budget', 'studio', 'musical', 'time', 'little', 'objectionable', 'material']",Stork Club

I don't think that any film with Betty Hutton has ever disappointed me- The musical numbers are great and the interaction between Betty and Barry Fitzgerald are hilarious. I can't speak for the difference between the VHS and the DVD, but the quality of the DVD is marginal. It is possible that this being a B movie the only prints available are marginal at best.

710103,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B00006AUGQ,Phil S.,"[1, 1]","Read that the ""ever popular"" Mae Busch was in the cast, so I bought the DVD hoping to see Oliver Hardy's film wife in a later effort.It took some research but I learned that she had a tiny, uncredited role in this opus made in the year before she passed away.While I looked for ""Mrs. Hardy"", I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this very well crafted musical with a star I knew very little about - I can understand why Betty Hutton had such a long and successful movie career - bundle of energy and talent. Could get sentimental and bring the viewer to tears, within seconds of delivering an uptempo swing number.I can see a strong (presumptive) role model for Lucille Ball. Mayhe not as ""funny* as Lucy, but obviously a greater singer and dancer.Movie could be described as a B+ feature; terrific songs by Hoagy Carmichael, Livingston and Evans, etc. Excellent performance by Barry Fitzgerald as the wealthy benefactor who ""repays"" Hutton for saving his life in the opening scene, at a dock where BF falls into the lake. Hutton, in bathing suit attire, gets a chance to challenge contemporary, Betty Grable.Picture runs about ten minutes too long, and the crazy, easy going plot suddenly gets a just a little cumbersome, as Don Defoe, the War hero now home with a dream of getting a band off the ground, reaches the breaking point as he tries to sort out Betty's good-hearted but complicated machinations. By that time we're getting a little exhausted, too.Can't identify Fitzgeralds' Financial Advisor in this film, but his performance is outstanding. He's told to never reveal Fitzgerald's identity and he's totally committed to his role, despite Fitzgerald's ultimate concession that he must do so, before the whole things gets too out of hand.There's a beautifully shot scene, where Betty can't take it anymore - her wealth has helped only DeFoes' *band* and noone else, and she attacks her wardrobe closet, so as to toss away the fabulous threads and return them; but not so assertively when the mink she bought with her new bloated bankroll, stares her in the face. (Mae Bush was the Sales Lady. She has about three lines and the only chance to see her face is to look carefully for her reflection in the mirror in the Shop. I paused the action and could see her reverse-image. Although with apparent gray hair she looks the same as on the ""old days""; her distinctive voice comes through).Mae might have made a terrific estranged wife for Barry, but the part went to an actress I'm not familiar with, who does an excellent job.Black and white DVD quality a bit cloudy, sound passable.",3,Where was Mae Busch?,1214956800,"07 2, 2008",2008,2593,"['Read', 'ever', 'popular', 'Mae', 'Busch', 'was', 'cast', 'bought', 'DVD', 'hoping', 'see', 'Oliver', 'Hardy', 'film', 'wife', 'later', 'effort.It', 'took', 'research', 'learned', 'had', 'tiny', 'uncredited', 'role', 'opus', 'made', 'year', 'passed', 'away.While', 'looked', 'Mrs.', 'Hardy', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'well', 'crafted', 'musical', 'star', 'knew', 'very', 'little', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'Betty', 'Hutton', 'had', 'long', 'successful', 'movie', 'career', 'bundle', 'energy', 'talent', 'Could', 'get', 'sentimental', 'bring', 'viewer', 'tears', 'seconds', 'delivering', 'uptempo', 'swing', 'number.I', 'can', 'see', 'strong', 'presumptive', 'role', 'model', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'Mayhe', 'not', 'funny*', 'Lucy', 'obviously', 'greater', 'singer', 'dancer.Movie', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'B+', 'feature', 'terrific', 'songs', 'Hoagy', 'Carmichael', 'Livingston', 'Evans', 'etc', 'Excellent', 'performance', 'Barry', 'Fitzgerald', 'wealthy', 'benefactor', 'who', 'repays', 'Hutton', 'saving', 'life', 'opening', 'scene', 'dock', 'where', 'BF', 'lake', 'Hutton', 'bathing', 'suit', 'attire', 'chance', 'challenge', 'contemporary', 'Betty', 'Grable.Picture', 'ten', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'crazy', 'easy', 'going', 'plot', 'suddenly', 'just', 'little', 'cumbersome', 'Don', 'Defoe', 'War', 'hero', 'now', 'dream', 'getting', 'band', 'ground', 'breaking', 'point', 'sort', 'out', 'Betty', 'good-hearted', 'complicated', 'machinations', 'time', ""'re"", 'getting', 'little', 'exhausted', 'too.Ca', ""n't"", 'identify', 'Fitzgeralds', 'Financial', 'Advisor', 'film', 'performance', 'outstanding', 'told', 'never', 'reveal', 'Fitzgerald', 'identity', 'totally', 'committed', 'role', 'Fitzgerald', 'ultimate', 'concession', 'must', 'do', 'so', 'whole', 'things', 'too', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'scene', 'where', 'Betty', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'anymore', 'wealth', 'helped', 'only', 'DeFoes', '*band*', 'noone', 'else', 'wardrobe', 'closet', 'so', 'toss', 'away', 'fabulous', 'threads', 'return', 'not', 'so', 'assertively', 'when', 'mink', 'bought', 'new', 'bloated', 'bankroll', 'face', 'Mae', 'Bush', 'was', 'Sales', 'Lady', 'about', 'three', 'lines', 'only', 'chance', 'see', 'face', 'look', 'carefully', 'reflection', 'mirror', 'Shop', 'paused', 'action', 'could', 'see', 'reverse-image', 'apparent', 'gray', 'hair', 'same', 'old', 'days', 'distinctive', 'voice', '.Mae', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'terrific', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Barry', 'part', 'went', 'actress', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'who', 'excellent', 'job.Black', 'white', 'DVD', 'quality', 'bit', 'cloudy', 'sound', 'passable']",Stork Club
