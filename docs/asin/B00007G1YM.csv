728358,A20EEWWSFMZ1PN,B00007G1YM,"bernie ""xyzzy""","[0, 0]","There are many great documentaries that show the back-and-forth migrations of people in Europe and Britain. This includes popular wars, language changes, religious changes, economics, etc.This documentary shows the same information with a few more details that you might have missed as the slant is really on Irish history. Irish history is not in a vacuum so to describe it properly we must get the big picture of what else was going on in the European world about those times.This is an excellent production. There's lots of fine photography. Besides the excellent narration you will notice actual scholars that you are familiar with and some that you want to be familiar with.The only negative side of this presentation and it's not that negative is that they show too many modern representatives and places while describing 6,000 years of historical events. They could have either cut that out and made the documentary shorter or possibly used more maps and maybe some animation.I was familiar with general history before watching this documentary. However I did not know a lot of the details of the individual battles. And the long-range consequences of those battles. I was also intrigued in the section where the Irish reintroduced Christianity to Europe as somehow that was missed in my other histories.Being 162 minutes long if I went through most of the details of this presentation the review would be like a book. Even though there is a lot of detail you feel like they left just as much out. By the time you get to the end you might've forgotten some of the things you saw at the beginning; so this is worth rewatching periodically.In Search of Ancient Ireland: From Neolithic Times to the Coming of the English",5,Detailed view of European history with an Irish slant,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,1724,"['are', 'many', 'great', 'documentaries', 'show', 'back-and-forth', 'migrations', 'people', 'Europe', 'Britain', 'popular', 'wars', 'language', 'changes', 'religious', 'changes', 'economics', 'etc.This', 'documentary', 'same', 'information', 'few', 'more', 'details', 'might', 'have', 'missed', 'slant', 'really', 'Irish', 'history', 'Irish', 'history', 'not', 'vacuum', 'so', 'describe', 'properly', 'must', 'get', 'big', 'picture', 'what', 'else', 'was', 'going', 'European', 'world', 'times.This', 'excellent', 'production', 'lots', 'fine', 'photography', 'excellent', 'narration', 'will', 'notice', 'actual', 'scholars', 'are', 'familiar', 'want', 'be', 'familiar', 'only', 'negative', 'side', 'presentation', 'not', 'negative', 'show', 'too', 'many', 'modern', 'representatives', 'places', 'describing', '6,000', 'years', 'historical', 'events', 'could', 'have', 'cut', 'out', 'made', 'documentary', 'shorter', 'possibly', 'used', 'more', 'maps', 'maybe', 'animation.I', 'was', 'familiar', 'general', 'history', 'watching', 'documentary', 'However', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'lot', 'details', 'individual', 'battles', 'long-range', 'consequences', 'battles', 'was', 'also', 'intrigued', 'section', 'where', 'Irish', 'reintroduced', 'Christianity', 'Europe', 'somehow', 'was', 'missed', 'other', 'histories.Being', '162', 'minutes', 'long', 'went', 'most', 'details', 'presentation', 'review', 'would', 'be', 'book', 'Even', 'lot', 'detail', 'feel', 'left', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'get', 'end', 'might', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'things', 'saw', 'beginning', 'worth', 'rewatching', 'periodically.In', 'Search', 'Ancient', 'Ireland', 'From', 'Neolithic', 'Times', 'Coming', 'English']",N/A

728362,A1LVHR5OO45L5V,B00007G1YM,JAG 2.0,"[0, 0]","This PBS production, In Search Of Ancient Ireland, is a spectacularly filmed journey through Ireland's past from the earliest cultures to the Norman period of conquest.Firstly, I have to praise the cinematography and the breathtaking footage of Ireland's natural beauty. The landscape the viewer sees throughout this DVD is simply marvelous.The DVD begins with the earliest people and the scant evidence of their culture. Monoliths, stone circles and stone tombs show that Ireland's people were in contact with cultures in Britain and the continent and shared a pan-European culture to some extent. The video covers the early sagas and myths and there is some debate of whether they are the shadowy remembrance of a distant past or more recent invention.The viewer is introduced to brief discussions of the religions and music of Ireland's early inhabitants as well as the dominance of &#34;Celtic&#34; culture with its highly abstract artwork and decoration. I was surprised by the dearth of discussion of Druids and the, in my mind, odd claims that rejected the idea of a Celtic invasion of Ireland. The historian who scoffed at even the idea that Celtic people invaded and subjugated Ireland claimed that people simply adopted the Celtic language and customs over time. To me, this is silly. Most Irish today speak English because Ireland was invaded by an English-speaking warrior-elite who brought English-speaking colonists with them and forced the native Irish to speak the language of the invader.The DVD did a fine job of showing the far reaching influence of Christianity and the contributions of Ireland's Christians. It begins with a discussion of St. Patrick, a Briton who had been captured and enslaved by Irish brigands who escaped and returned to the land of his bondage to spread Christianity. There is an all-to-brief glance at the Book of Kells as well as the effects of Irish scholarship on the larger Christian community.The Viking influence on Ireland is explored as we learn of the founding of Dublin by Norse traders and warriors. The Vikings would have great impact on Ireland for centuries. It also leads into the armed conflicts both against the invading Norse and the internecine fighting that was common. Brian Boru comes across as the uniter of Ireland he was.This is a well made and very entertaining DVD that certainly exceeds the standard we expect from a PBS production. I am not Irish, but I greatly enjoyed the journey to finding ancient Ireland.

Guild,"[23, 23]","This is the most superb and engrossing documentary on the history of ancient Ireland that I have ever come across.It is 170 minutes of expertly crafted explanation of Irelands histoey devided in three parts.The first hour deals with Ireland before Christianity.It takes us back to over 3,000 years BC and explains the growth of civilization and all the monuments,legends and beliefs prior to the development of Christianity.Then ,in part two, we are taken through the development of Christianity between the 5th and 9th centuries AD and the development of scholarship,theology and art which helped to bring Europe out of the Dark Ages after the fall of the Roman Empire.Then in part three,it deals with the coming of the Vikings,the dynastic battles of the Irish Kings,the corrupt practices of the Celtic church leading up to the Norman invasion to the time where Ireland became ruled by outsiders.This is 3 hours of excellently presented history with  many of the most knowledable historians making appearances and explaining this history right at the sites where it took place.The photography is as excellent as the masterial presented.The history of Ireland is 6,000 years of highly complicated history,not easily condensed into 3 hours;but this documentary has done it magnificently.It is so well done,I will return to it often.Included with the documentary is a movie ""Over Ireland"".It is 60 minutes of spellbinding travel around Ireland ,all from the air .Watching it,one gets the feel that they are viewing all Ireland as if they were on a magic carpet. I have been to Ireland three times and seen many of the sites,monuments,landsccape villages and cities;but it is not quite the same as seeing it all from the height of a few hundred feet.Not only do we see it all from above,but we are given excellent commentary all along the way.For anyone who has ever been to Ireland,plan to visit,or simply interested in Ireland's history,art,beauty ;you will be mesmerized with this DVD.",5,"""In Ireland the past is ever present""",1217808000,"08 4, 2008",2008,1986,"['most', 'superb', 'engrossing', 'documentary', 'history', 'ancient', 'Ireland', 'have', 'ever', 'come', 'across.It', '170', 'minutes', 'expertly', 'crafted', 'explanation', 'Irelands', 'histoey', 'devided', 'three', 'parts.The', 'first', 'hour', 'deals', 'Ireland', 'Christianity.It', 'back', '3,000', 'years', 'BC', 'growth', 'civilization', 'monuments', 'legends', 'beliefs', 'prior', 'development', 'Christianity.Then', 'part', 'two', 'are', 'taken', 'development', 'Christianity', '5th', '9th', 'centuries', 'AD', 'development', 'scholarship', 'theology', 'art', 'helped', 'bring', 'Europe', 'Dark', 'Ages', 'fall', 'Roman', 'Empire.Then', 'part', 'three', 'coming', 'Vikings', 'dynastic', 'battles', 'Irish', 'Kings', 'corrupt', 'practices', 'Celtic', 'church', 'leading', 'up', 'Norman', 'invasion', 'time', 'where', 'Ireland', 'became', 'ruled', 'outsiders.This', '3', 'hours', 'excellently', 'presented', 'history', 'many', 'most', 'knowledable', 'historians', 'making', 'appearances', 'explaining', 'history', 'right', 'sites', 'where', 'took', 'place.The', 'photography', 'as', 'excellent', 'masterial', 'presented.The', 'history', 'Ireland', '6,000', 'years', 'highly', 'complicated', 'history', 'not', 'easily', 'condensed', '3', 'hours', 'documentary', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'will', 'return', 'often.Included', 'documentary', 'movie', 'Ireland', '.It', '60', 'minutes', 'spellbinding', 'travel', 'Ireland', 'all', 'air', '.Watching', 'one', 'feel', 'are', 'viewing', 'Ireland', 'were', 'magic', 'carpet', 'have', 'been', 'Ireland', 'three', 'times', 'seen', 'many', 'sites', 'monuments', 'landsccape', 'villages', 'cities', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'seeing', 'height', 'few', 'hundred', 'feet.Not', 'only', 'do', 'see', 'are', 'given', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'way.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'Ireland', 'plan', 'visit', 'simply', 'interested', 'Ireland', 'history', 'art', 'beauty', 'will', 'be', 'mesmerized', 'DVD']",N/A

728366,ANEDXRFDZDL18,B00007G1YM,Serene Night,"[136, 145]","I really enjoyed &quot;In Search of Ancient Ireland&quot; especially, the first segment. This DVD is divided into 3 parts, (which were obviously intended to be shown as three different hourly shows), &quot;Pre-Christian Ireland&quot; I.E. Stone Age, Bronze age etc., &quot;Missionary Era  Ireland,&quot; and &quot;Ireland Under the Vikings&quot; which covers Ireland under the control of Vikings, through Brian Boru.My favorite part of the DVD, was the first part: Pre-Christian Ireland. (In my opinion, this the only segment that should truly be called &quot;Ancient&quot;). Herein, the narrator discusses what life in Ancient Ireland was like. They delve into Ancient Irish religion, culture, and take you to numerous ancient sites, and even demonstrate how ancient Irish musical instruments were played. This was the most exciting and gripping part.The remaining two segments were less interesting for me. (Perhaps, because this era of Irish history is frequently documented, and hence more widely known).The only Caveat's I had with this DVD, were:  In segment one, they did not discuss bards or druids hardly at all. There were no reconstructional illustrations which might show us how ancient clothing was worn, or how ancient sites might've once looked.  No discussion of women's roles at all. Section 2: There was recycled footage from section one, (such as scenes with a street faire etc.), and devoting an entire hour to the discussion of monasteries was a bit dry (even if the scenery was breathtaking). This has been covered before in better documentaries. Section 3: Also, recycled footage, and more discussion of monasteries as vikings raided them. Lots of footage of modern military speculating about how warfare must've been like back then, and in the same vein, speculation by modern ship captains on Viking raiding technique. Again, interesting, but less fascinating than the first part.Overall, I enjoyed this DVD a great deal, but I would've preferred more ANCIENT history, (I.E.) Stone age, Bronze Age, etc. And less focus on Early Medieval history.",5,"Great, a few quibbles....",1048723200,"03 27, 2003",2003,2070,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'quot', 'Search', 'Ancient', 'Ireland', 'quot', 'especially', 'first', 'segment', 'DVD', 'divided', '3', 'parts', 'were', 'obviously', 'intended', 'be', 'shown', 'three', 'different', 'hourly', 'shows', 'quot', 'Pre-Christian', 'Ireland', 'quot', 'I.E', 'Stone', 'Age', 'Bronze', 'age', 'etc.', 'quot', 'Missionary', 'Era', 'Ireland', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ireland', 'Vikings', 'quot', 'Ireland', 'control', 'Vikings', 'Brian', 'Boru.My', 'favorite', 'part', 'DVD', 'was', 'first', 'part', 'Pre-Christian', 'Ireland', 'opinion', 'only', 'segment', 'should', 'truly', 'be', 'called', 'quot', 'Ancient', 'quot', 'Herein', 'narrator', 'what', 'life', 'Ancient', 'Ireland', 'was', 'delve', 'Ancient', 'Irish', 'religion', 'culture', 'take', 'numerous', 'ancient', 'sites', 'even', 'demonstrate', 'how', 'ancient', 'Irish', 'musical', 'instruments', 'were', 'played', 'was', 'most', 'exciting', 'gripping', 'part.The', 'remaining', 'two', 'segments', 'were', 'less', 'interesting', 'Perhaps', 'era', 'Irish', 'history', 'frequently', 'documented', 'hence', 'more', 'widely', 'known', 'only', 'Caveat', 'had', 'DVD', 'were', 'segment', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'discuss', 'bards', 'druids', 'hardly', 'were', 'reconstructional', 'illustrations', 'might', 'show', 'how', 'ancient', 'clothing', 'was', 'worn', 'how', 'ancient', 'sites', 'might', ""'ve"", 'once', 'looked', 'discussion', 'women', 'roles', 'Section', '2', 'was', 'recycled', 'footage', 'section', 'one', 'such', 'scenes', 'street', 'faire', 'etc', 'devoting', 'entire', 'hour', 'discussion', 'monasteries', 'was', 'bit', 'dry', 'even', 'scenery', 'was', 'breathtaking', 'been', 'covered', 'better', 'documentaries', 'Section', '3', 'Also', 'recycled', 'footage', 'more', 'discussion', 'monasteries', 'vikings', 'raided', 'Lots', 'footage', 'modern', 'military', 'speculating', 'how', 'warfare', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'back', 'then', 'same', 'vein', 'speculation', 'modern', 'ship', 'captains', 'Viking', 'raiding', 'technique', 'Again', 'interesting', 'less', 'fascinating', 'first', 'part.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'great', 'deal', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preferred', 'more', 'ANCIENT', 'history', 'I.E', 'Stone', 'age', 'Bronze', 'Age', 'etc', 'less', 'focus', 'Early', 'Medieval', 'history']",N/A
