He is the captain of the ferry that crosses the Strait from Gibraltar (VERY English) to Morocco (VERY un-English) after WWII, and he has an appropriate wife on each side: in Gibraltar the practical and homeloving cook and seamstress (Celia Johnson), and in Africa the luscious lover (Yvonne DeCarlo). He himself changes character to suit as he goes back and forth, and gradually fades from one into the other with each trip. He has solved the problem of masculine living by splitting one woman into two and having one of each.The ""Captain's Paradise"", of course, is a fool's paradise.Charm and amusement, brilliantly acted by all.

714985,A1JCWK43MAGZIG,B00006G8GD,"By Definition ""By Definition""","[1, 1]","Among all Guinness's extraordinary efforts in the 1950's, Captain's Paradise surely ranks with the best of them. It's not so much his performance which triumphs as much as the film itself, with an innovative and easy to follow story structure that surprised me. The thing you've gotta love about British comedies is they are so literate yet easy to follow. The writing is just so solid. As they say in Hollywood, it's a ""high concept"" story, well executed, as it were.Guinness as Captain Henry St. James seems to have the best of everything as he shuttles between Gibraltar and Morocco on his passenger vessel, enjoying the life of an intellectual yet bon vivant Captain both aboard his vessel and with his sultry girlfriend in Tangier or something (played with lusty gusto by the ravishing Yvonne De Carlo!) and a more placid married life with his obedient wife (Celia Johnson) back in the British territory of Gibraltar. It is the strong male fantasy element that kept me coming back for more.From the tender mercies of a firing squad to the miserable life of the two-timing bigamist (the flamenco dancing scene with Guinness and DeCarlo was the best!), Paradise is a film full of invidious and cross-cultural comparisons placed in an amusing and comical light. It's supposedly ""male-chauvinist"" investigation into the nature of marriage and relationships, with the Euro-British twist, is particularly enlightening. What is most unusual about the film is that, unlike most situation comedies, it takes place over a significant span of time -- time enough for his ladies to change their stripes.While Anthony Kimmins is not a famous director, I like his transparent, easy-going style, and his use of straight-on closeups was excellent. Kimmins doesn't get in the way of the story at all.The only bad thing I can say about this film is the ending to the story is not fully resolved, just implied. They skipped over some details in the interest of achieving a brisk 96 minutes. That's OK.I could hear foreshadowings of ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" in that excellent score by Malcolm Arnold (who scored both films -- many of the same ""climbing dread"" chord progressions), plus the fact that Guinness is also, in this film, a commander in uniform, once again reminds me of Kwai.For the infinitely malleable Guinness (this time in the sneaky rascal mold), and the very delicious, sexy Yvonne DeCarlo, this is a film you don't want to miss.

There's still alot to enjoy here even though the film doesn't attain the classic heights of Alec Guiness' Ealing work.  It's kind of a departure for Guiness to play such an amoral heel and he seems to relish it.  And he does a mean flamenco as demonstrated in his scenes with Yvonne DeCarlo.  Speaking of DeCarlo, she's a revelation here as the saucy Spanish vixen that Guiness' captain has holed up in Tangiers.  She not only smolders onscreen but she has a deft comic touch.  Celia Johnson is good as well as the proper English wife that Guiness assumes is content with the role he prescribes for her.  On the whole a consistently funny film.

714988,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,B00006G8GD,Douglas M,"[2, 2]","""The Captain's Paradise"" is a very droll comedy in which Alec Guinness plays against type as a sophisticated Don Juan with 2 women in his life, each representing the 2 halves, in his words, of the perfect woman. One is Celia Johnson ,the proper little English housewife, drab, unimaginative, eager to please and sexless. The other is continental Yvonne De Carlo, sexy, flamboyant and exciting. The film ran into problems with the censors when it was released in America and it is easy to see why because it covers adultery and suggests bigamy. If the script is full of sexist cliches, who cares.This is one film where Guinness's renowned versatility is outshone by the woman. Underrated De Carlo is hilarious, beautifully balancing her sex appeal with a very feminine warmth while Johnson's eager attempts to please are a standout. The film is very well made and the story unfolds logically building to a climax but a rather silly denouement. There is a very funny running gag about rissoles.The DVD print is pristine but the extras are spartan. The original  trailer is included plus a brief biographical essay on Guinness. The best is the insert in the DVD case which is a neat summary of interesting background to the the making of the film, particularly the problems with the censor.The DVD is good value if purchased as part of an Alec Guinness Collection.",4,Droll witty Guinness,1229212800,"12 14, 2008",2008,1361,"['Captain', 'Paradise', 'very', 'droll', 'comedy', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'type', 'sophisticated', 'Don', 'Juan', '2', 'women', 'life', 'representing', '2', 'halves', 'words', 'perfect', 'woman', 'One', 'Celia', 'Johnson', 'proper', 'little', 'English', 'housewife', 'drab', 'unimaginative', 'eager', 'please', 'sexless', 'other', 'continental', 'Yvonne', 'De', 'Carlo', 'sexy', 'flamboyant', 'exciting', 'film', 'ran', 'problems', 'censors', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'America', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'adultery', 'bigamy', 'script', 'full', 'sexist', 'cliches', 'who', 'cares.This', 'one', 'film', 'where', 'Guinness', 'renowned', 'versatility', 'outshone', 'woman', 'Underrated', 'De', 'Carlo', 'hilarious', 'beautifully', 'balancing', 'sex', 'appeal', 'very', 'feminine', 'warmth', 'Johnson', 'eager', 'attempts', 'please', 'are', 'standout', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'story', 'logically', 'building', 'climax', 'rather', 'silly', 'denouement', 'very', 'funny', 'running', 'gag', 'rissoles.The', 'DVD', 'print', 'pristine', 'extras', 'are', 'spartan', 'original', 'trailer', 'included', 'brief', 'biographical', 'essay', 'Guinness', 'best', 'insert', 'DVD', 'case', 'neat', 'summary', 'interesting', 'background', 'making', 'film', 'particularly', 'problems', 'censor.The', 'DVD', 'good', 'value', 'purchased', 'part', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'Collection']",The Captain's Paradise

I think it did reflect views in the early fifties, but the overall problem was that the movie seemed quite dated (forgiveable, I suppose, after 50 years, but some movies much older don't seem dated in the same way).The plot involves the captain of a ferry boat that goes back and forth between Gibraltar and North Africa.  The captain's search for paradise appears to have been reached -- he has a wife on each side of the straits, and each wife specializes in some aspect of the perfect wife -- one is sexy, Spanish, and exotic, the other is domestic and very British.  Neither, of course, knows about the other, but eventually his paradise starts to fall apart.It's amusing, but somehow didn't hold my interest all that well.

714996,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00006G8GD,Robert Moore,"[4, 9]","Alec Guinness is one of my favorite actors, and I'm especially fond of the films he made with Ealing, including such gems as THE LAVENDER HILL MOB, THE MAN IN THE WHITE SUIT, and KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS.  However, among Guinness's Earling comedies, this is the least among his efforts.  The basic problem with the film is twofold.  On the one hand, the film embarks with an ill assorted group of elements and a weak script that never pulls those elements together.  In fact, many of the conceits of the film are a bit too obvious and heavy handed to succeed as comedy.  I'm thinking of the gifts that the captain gives to his two wives, or the way he rigidly forces each one to adhere to the role he has charted for them, or the constant way his first mate refers to the captain as a ""genius,"" when nothing even especially clever is detectable in his actions.The story is of a ship captain who runs a regular route between North Africa and Gibraltar who has not merely a girlfriend in each port but a wife.  But each one is selected to cater to a particular set of needs.  His wife in North Africa is a wild, unbridled, dancing, hard drinking party girl (played by Canadian Yvonne de Carlo), while his wife in Gibraltar is a solid, unpretentious, conservative (or so he thinks) homebody (played by the great Celia Johnson, in one of her rare film appearances).  Predictably, each one wants to break out of the role he has prescribed for them: the hottie wants to cook and wear and apron, and the stay-at-home wants to go dancing and wear a bikini.  The problem is that this is all only superficially funny, and while all the principles do the best that they can under the conditions, it all doesn't add up to very much.The film is moderately enjoyable for two reasons:  first, Guinness is a joy to watch even in a lesser role, second, the film contains some fascinating location shots.  It was amazingly interesting to see the shots of early fifties Gibraltar and Africa, although none of the actors actually appeared in them (one shot of Guinness walking along a street in Gibraltar obviously was the result of film of him being superimposed on the location footage).  As much as I like Celia Johnson, this simply wasn't a very good role for her.  All in all, one at the end feels that so much more should have resulted from all of this.  I can moderately recommend the film for Guinness and Ealing completists, but overall I don't think it is much of a film.I should point out that Alec Guinness was a real life ship captain.  During WW II, before his screen success, he captained landing ships.  He liked in interviews to boast of having been in charge of the first ship to hit the shore in the invasion of Sicily.  Unfortunately, that experience didn't seem to help this film very much.",3,"One of Guinness's weaker films, but still some fun",1099958400,"11 9, 2004",2004,2791,"['Alec', 'Guinness', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', ""'m"", 'especially', 'fond', 'films', 'made', 'Ealing', 'including', 'such', 'gems', 'THE', 'LAVENDER', 'HILL', 'MOB', 'THE', 'MAN', 'IN', 'THE', 'WHITE', 'SUIT', 'KIND', 'HEARTS', 'AND', 'CORONETS', 'However', 'Guinness', 'Earling', 'comedies', 'least', 'efforts', 'basic', 'problem', 'film', 'twofold', 'one', 'hand', 'film', 'ill', 'assorted', 'group', 'elements', 'weak', 'script', 'never', 'pulls', 'elements', 'together', 'fact', 'many', 'conceits', 'film', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'obvious', 'heavy', 'handed', 'succeed', 'comedy', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'gifts', 'captain', 'two', 'wives', 'way', 'rigidly', 'one', 'adhere', 'role', 'charted', 'constant', 'way', 'first', 'mate', 'refers', 'captain', 'genius', 'when', 'nothing', 'even', 'especially', 'clever', 'detectable', 'actions.The', 'story', 'ship', 'captain', 'who', 'regular', 'route', 'North', 'Africa', 'Gibraltar', 'who', 'not', 'merely', 'girlfriend', 'port', 'wife', 'one', 'selected', 'cater', 'particular', 'set', 'needs', 'wife', 'North', 'Africa', 'wild', 'unbridled', 'dancing', 'hard', 'drinking', 'party', 'girl', 'played', 'Canadian', 'Yvonne', 'de', 'Carlo', 'wife', 'Gibraltar', 'solid', 'unpretentious', 'conservative', 'so', 'homebody', 'played', 'great', 'Celia', 'Johnson', 'one', 'rare', 'film', 'appearances', 'Predictably', 'one', 'break', 'role', 'prescribed', 'hottie', 'cook', 'wear', 'apron', 'stay-at-home', 'go', 'dancing', 'wear', 'bikini', 'problem', 'only', 'superficially', 'funny', 'principles', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'conditions', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'very', 'much.The', 'film', 'moderately', 'enjoyable', 'two', 'reasons', 'first', 'Guinness', 'joy', 'watch', 'even', 'lesser', 'role', 'second', 'film', 'fascinating', 'location', 'shots', 'was', 'amazingly', 'interesting', 'see', 'shots', 'early', 'fifties', 'Gibraltar', 'Africa', 'none', 'actors', 'actually', 'appeared', 'one', 'shot', 'Guinness', 'walking', 'along', 'street', 'Gibraltar', 'obviously', 'was', 'result', 'film', 'being', 'superimposed', 'location', 'footage', 'As', 'much', 'like', 'Celia', 'Johnson', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'role', 'one', 'end', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'resulted', 'can', 'moderately', 'recommend', 'film', 'Guinness', 'Ealing', 'completists', 'overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'film.I', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'ship', 'captain', 'WW', 'II', 'screen', 'success', 'captained', 'landing', 'ships', 'liked', 'interviews', 'boast', 'having', 'been', 'charge', 'first', 'ship', 'hit', 'shore', 'invasion', 'Sicily', 'Unfortunately', 'experience', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'help', 'film', 'very', 'much']",The Captain's Paradise
714997,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B00006G8GD,Robert Morris,"[26, 28]","I recently purchased The Horse's Mouth (1958) from Amazon as well as ""The Alec Guinness Collection"" which includes The Captain's Paradise (1953) plus four others: Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), The Man in the White Suit (1951), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951), and The Ladykillers (1955). Frankly, I was amazed how well each of the six films has held up since I first saw it.Although I do not rank The Captain's Paradise in the highest echelon of Guinness' comedies, his character is nonetheless a highly entertaining variation on Thurber's Walter Mitty. As the film begins, Captain Henry St. James seems to be having his cake and eating it too. In a word, bigamy. He has Maud in Gibraltar (played by Celia Johnson) and Nita (played by Yvonne de Carlo) in North Africa. This ship's captain has not only a girl but a devoted wife in each port. Working with a script by Alex Coppel-Nicholas Phipps and directed by Anthony Kimmins, Guinness is in fine form as both the prim and proper husband of homebody Maud and the night clubbing companion of the sultry Nita. One of the oldest and most effective of comic devices is the role reversal. In reality, Maud yearns to be viewed as St. James sees Nita and Nita...you get the idea. That is the basic conceit of this delightful film.The plot developments accelerate when St. James purchases what he deems to be appropriate gifts for his two wives, only to get them mixed up and inadvertently gives the wrong one to each. Their reactions threaten his paradise. How does he handle the crisis? What is his situation as the film ends? And are there any lessons to be learned from all this? Judge for yourself. One final point: If you have not already seen this and the other four films in ""The Alec Guinness Collection,"" I envy you.

It's witty, and rather high-concept, with a plot that's a seamless sweetly spun sly confection, and was nominated for a Best Writing Oscar.  It stars the uber-talented Alec Guinness. (He  was, at this time, rather early in his career, considered a comic actor--seeKind Hearts and Coronets - (The Criterion Collection);  but he would win a Best Actor Oscar in the late 1950's forThe Bridge on the River Kwai (Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray], and then become internationally famous, as never before, inStar Wars Trilogy.) Here he plays the title part in the movie, a part that might have been tailored just for him: Mediterranean ferryboat captain Henry St. James.  The Captain has things nicely organized for himself, thank you very much: He's got a loving, conventional, ""veddy"" English wife Maud (Celia Johnson,Brief Encounter - Criterion Collection) in the restricted British colony of Gibraltar; and a possessive, hot-blooded mistress Nita (Yvonne De Carlo,McLintock!),  in Spanish Morocco.  It's a perfect arrangement, as long as he can keep them apart. But what happens when one woman decides to follow him to the other port?Guinness is said to have respected, and enjoyed working with De Carlo, who is said to have found this one of her best roles.  She had supposedly been a professional dancer, and is said to have taught him the tango for their memorable dance scene.  Furthermore, this movie allows Johnson a chance to give her hanky a rest: she doesn't cry once. Guinness has also got some strong supporting players in this one.  Miles Malleson (KIND HEARTS) plays Lawrence St. James; Charles Goldner plays Chief Officer Ricco; Bill Fraser is Absalom, the taxi driver.  Sebastian Cabot (Family Affair: The Complete Series) is Ali, the vendor.  The movie was filmed on location at Gibraltar, and at Shepperton Studios; it was not made by Ealing Studios, powerhouse of British comedy in the 1950s.  The movie was remade as a mediocre TV entertainment, centered upon an airline stewardess, titled COFFEE, TEA OR ME, in 1973.  CAPTAINS PARADISE is a well-known and much-honored movie.  It's sexist, of course, but I wouldn't go getting all bent out of shape about that.
