Thanks to Fox Cinema Archives for bringing another fun movie out on dvd.  Peggy Cummins was hired to play the lead in FOREVER AMBER but got the ax.  But she is a delight in this one along with Victor Mature, Patricia Medina and Ethel Barrymore.  Cummins is very likeable and believable thought the film. The only other movie I have ever  seen her in is THE LATE GEORGE APLEY.

The cast includes Peggy Cummins, Victor Matureand Ethel Barrymore. Vincent Price and Patricia Medina have featured roles.A woman is found murdered in her room, which sets off a series of eventsthat ultimately puts the lives of two other women in eminent danger.Once the attempt to murder the final victim is thwarted, things are wrappedup quickly, so you may have a few lingering questions, but that's typicalof so many mystery thrillers in order to keep you guessing for as long as possible.If you like Gaslight, The Spiral Staircase, The Lodger and Hangover Square,I am sure you will enjoy Moss Rose.The picture and sound quality are far above Fox Cinema Archives usual standards,which is a relief since I have been waiting a long time to see this film again.If I could, I'd give this film 4 1/2 stars!",4,Excellent Victorian-Era Mystery Thriller,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,907,"['Moss', 'Rose', '1947', 'very', 'good', 'who', 'done', 'should', 'keep', 'youguessing', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'cast', 'Peggy', 'Cummins', 'Victor', 'Matureand', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Patricia', 'Medina', 'have', 'featured', 'roles.A', 'woman', 'found', 'murdered', 'room', 'off', 'series', 'eventsthat', 'ultimately', 'lives', 'two', 'other', 'women', 'eminent', 'danger.Once', 'attempt', 'murder', 'final', 'victim', 'thwarted', 'things', 'are', 'wrappedup', 'quickly', 'may', 'have', 'few', 'lingering', 'questions', 'typicalof', 'so', 'many', 'mystery', 'thrillers', 'order', 'keep', 'guessing', 'as', 'long', 'possible.If', 'Gaslight', 'Spiral', 'Staircase', 'Lodger', 'Hangover', 'Square', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Moss', 'Rose.The', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'far', 'Fox', 'Cinema', 'Archives', 'usual', 'standards', 'relief', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'long', 'time', 'see', 'film', 'again.If', 'could', ""'d"", 'give', 'film', '4', '1/2', 'stars']",Moss Rose
