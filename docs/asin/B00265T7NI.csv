Peter Strauss played the abscent father of two girls the youngest having seen the murder of her Mother.They have to give up a rich life style to live on a ranch where their father is just a Rodeo cowboy.  With the help of Mary McDonnel, a case worker from child services, he fights a wealthy Aunt and the ones who are investigating  their Mom's death to keep his girls but must first win the girls.

1250963,A3A39ARIPSVF0I,B00265T7NI,The Irish Lady,"[8, 9]","Been looking for this movie for a while.  I'm so glad I can find these ""hard to find"" movies on Amazon.  The whole family saw this a couple times before I decided to look for it.  I should say it has to touch some place in the heart when two 20-something men/boys actually tell Mom to find it.  It's really nice that there are still movies out there with no gunfire, excessive swearing and show some family togetherness.  I liked how emotional distance is bridged as the two girls start to see their father through kinder eyes than through those of the bitter aunt and her family.  Sure, some of both girls acting is immature, but the meanings and feelings do translate.  I also love just about any movie that Mary McDonnell is in.  Give this movie a hearty hurrah!",5,Great family movie,1256774400,"10 29, 2009",2009,765,"['Been', 'looking', 'movie', 'while', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'can', 'find', 'hard', 'find', 'movies', 'Amazon', 'whole', 'family', 'saw', 'couple', 'times', 'decided', 'look', 'should', 'say', 'touch', 'place', 'heart', 'when', 'two', '20-something', 'men/boys', 'actually', 'tell', 'Mom', 'find', 'really', 'nice', 'are', 'still', 'movies', 'there', 'gunfire', 'excessive', 'swearing', 'show', 'family', 'togetherness', 'liked', 'how', 'emotional', 'distance', 'bridged', 'two', 'girls', 'start', 'see', 'father', 'kinder', 'eyes', 'bitter', 'aunt', 'family', 'Sure', 'girls', 'acting', 'immature', 'meanings', 'feelings', 'do', 'translate', 'also', 'love', 'just', 'movie', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'Give', 'movie', 'hearty', 'hurrah']",A Fathers Choice
